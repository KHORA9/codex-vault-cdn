THAN THE QUEEN'S LIFE!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Queen is pretty well,\" Swift wrote to Lord Peterborough on May 18,\r\n1714, \"at present, but the least disorder she has puts all in alarm.\"\r\nSwift goes on to tell his correspondent that \"when it is over we act as\r\nif she were immortal; neither is it possible to persuade people to make\r\nany preparations against an evil day.\"  Yet on the condition of Queen\r\nAnne's health depended to all appearance the continuance of peace in\r\nEngland.  While Anne was sinking down to death, rival claimants were\r\nplanning to seize the throne; rival statesmen and rival parties were\r\nplotting, intriguing, sending emissaries, moving troops, organizing\r\narmies, for a great struggle.  Queen Anne had reigned for little more\r\nthan twelve years.  She succeeded William the Third on March 8, 1702,\r\nand at the time when Swift wrote the words we have quoted, her reign\r\nwas drawing rapidly to a close.\r\n\r\nAnne was not a woman of great capacity or of elevated moral tone.  She\r\nwas moral indeed in the narrow and more limited sense which the word\r\nhas lately come to have among us.  She always observed decorum and\r\npropriety herself; she always discouraged vice in others; but she had\r\nno idea of political morality or of high {2} political purpose, and she\r\nhad allowed herself to be made the instrument of one faction or\r\nanother, according as one old woman or the other prevailed over her\r\npassing mood.  While she was governed by the Duchess of Marlborough,\r\nthe Duke of Marlborough and his party had the ascendant.  When Mrs.\r\nMasham succeeded in establishing herself as chief favorite, the Duke of\r\nMarlborough and his followers went down.  Burnet, in his \"History of My\r\nOwn Times,\" says of Queen Anne, that she \"is easy of access, and hears\r\neverything very gently; but opens herself to so few, and is so cold and\r\ngeneral in her answers, that people soon find that the chief\r\napplication is to be made to her ministers and favorites, who, in their\r\nturns, have an entire credit and full power with her.  She has laid\r\ndown the splendor of a court too much, and eats privately; so that,\r\nexcept on Sundays, and a few hours twice or thrice a week, at night, in\r\nthe drawing-room, she appears so little that her court is, as it were,\r\nabandoned.\"  Although Anne lived during the Augustan Age of English\r\nliterature, she had no literary capacity or taste.  Kneller's portrait\r\nof the Queen gives her a face rather agreeable and intelligent than\r\notherwise--a round, full face, with ruddy complexion and dark-brown\r\nhair.  A courtly biographer, commenting on this portrait, takes\r\noccasion to observe that Anne \"was so universally beloved that her\r\ndeath was more sincerely lamented than that of perhaps any other\r\nmonarch who ever sat on the throne of these realms.\"  A curious comment\r\non that affection and devotion of the English people to Queen Anne is\r\nsupplied by the fact which Lord Stanhope mentions, that \"the funds rose\r\nconsiderably on the first tidings of her danger, and fell again on a\r\nreport of her recovery.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Fighting for the Crown]\r\n\r\nEngland watched with the greatest anxiety the latest days of Queen\r\nAnne's life; not out of any deep concern for the Queen herself, but\r\nsimply because of the knowledge that with her death must come a crisis\r\nand might come a revolution.  Who was to snatch the crown as it fell\r\nfrom Queen Anne's dying head?  Over at Herrenhausen, in {3} Hanover,\r\nwas one claimant to the throne; flitting between Lorraine and St.\r\nGermains was another.  Here, at home, in the Queen's very\r\ncouncil-chamber, round the Queen's dying bed, were the English heads of\r\nthe rival parties caballing against each other, some of them deceiving\r\nHanover, some of them deceiving James Stuart, and more than one, it\r\nmust be confessed, deceiving at the same moment Hanoverians and Stuarts\r\nalike.  Anne had no children living; she had borne to her husband, the\r\nfeeble and colorless George of Denmark, a great many children--eighteen\r\nor nineteen it is said--but most of them died in their very infancy,\r\nand none lived to maturity.  No succession therefore could take place,\r\nbut only an accession, and at such a crisis in the history of England\r\nany deviation from the direct line must bring peril with it.  At the\r\ntime when Queen Anne lay dying, it might have meant a new revolution\r\nand another civil war.\r\n\r\nWhile Anne lies on that which is soon to be her death-bed, let us take\r\na glance at the rival claimants of her crown, and the leading English\r\nstatesmen who were partisans on this side or on that, or who were still\r\nhesitating about the side it would be, on the whole, most prudent and\r\nprofitable to choose.\r\n\r\nThe English Parliament had taken steps, immediately after the\r\nRevolution of 1688, to prevent a restoration of the Stuart dynasty.\r\nThe Bill of Rights, passed in the first year of the reign of William\r\nand Mary, declared that the crown of England should pass in the first\r\ninstance to the heirs of Mary, then to the Princess Anne, her sister,\r\nand to the heirs of the Princess Anne, and after that to the heirs, if\r\nany, of William, by any subsequent marriage.  Mary, however, died\r\nchildless; William was sinking into years and in miserable health,\r\napparently only waiting and anxious for death, and it was clear that he\r\nwould not marry again.  The only one of Anne's many children who\r\napproached maturity, the Duke of Gloucester, died just after his\r\neleventh birthday.  The little duke was a pupil of Bishop Burnet, and\r\nwas a child of great promise.  {4} Readers of fiction will remember\r\nthat Henry Esmond, in Thackeray's novel, is described as having\r\nobtained some distinction in his academical course, \"his Latin poem on\r\nthe 'Death of the Duke of Gloucester,' Princess Anne of Denmark's son,\r\nhaving gained him a medal and introduced him to the society of the\r\nUniversity wits.\"  After the death of this poor child it was thought\r\nnecessary that some new steps should be taken to cut off the chances of\r\nthe Stuarts.  The Act of Settlement, passed in 1701, excluded the sons\r\nor successors of James the Second, and all other Catholic claimants,\r\nfrom the throne of England, and entailed the crown on the Electress\r\nSophia of Hanover as the nearest Protestant heir, in case neither the\r\nreigning king nor the Princess Anne should have issue.  The Electress\r\nSophia was the mother of George, afterwards the First of England.  She\r\nseems to have had good-sense as well as talent; her close friend\r\nLeibnitz once said of her that she was not only given to asking why,\r\nbut also wanted to know the why of the whys.  She was not very anxious\r\nto see her son George made sovereign of England, and appeared to be\r\nunder the impression that his training and temper would not allow him\r\nto govern with a due regard for the notions of constitutional liberty\r\nwhich prevailed even then among Englishmen.  It even seems that Sophia\r\nmade the suggestion that James Stuart, the Old Pretender, as he has\r\nsince been called, would do well to become a Protestant, go in for\r\nconstitutional Government, and thus have a chance of the English\r\nthrone.  It is certain that she strongly objected to his being compared\r\nwith Perkin Warbeck, or called a bastard.  She accepted, however, the\r\nposition offered to her and her son by the Act of Settlement, and\r\nappears to have become gradually reconciled to it, and even, as she\r\nsank into years, is said to have expressed a hope many times that the\r\nname of Queen of England might be inscribed upon her coffin.  She came\r\nvery near to the gratification of her wish.  She died in June, 1714,\r\nbeing then in her eighty-fourth year--only a very few days before {5}\r\nQueen Anne received her first warning of the near approach of death.\r\nHer son George succeeded to her claim upon the crown of England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--The House of Brunswick]\r\n\r\nThe reigning house of Hanover was one of those lucky families which\r\nappear to have what may be called a gift of inheritance.  There are\r\nsome such houses among European sovereignties; whenever there is a\r\nbreach in the continuity of succession anywhere, one or other of them\r\nis sure to come in for the inheritance.  George the Elector, who was\r\nnow waiting to become King of England as soon as the breath should be\r\nout of Anne's body, belonged to the House of Guelf, or Welf, said to\r\nhave been founded by Guelf, the son of Isembert, a count of Altdorf,\r\nand Irmintrude, sister of Charlemagne, early in the ninth century.  It\r\nhad two branches, which were united in the eleventh century by the\r\nmarriage of one of the Guelf ladies to Albert Azzo the Second, Lord of\r\nEste and Marquis of Italy.  His son Guelf obtained the Bavarian\r\npossessions of his wife's step-father, a Guelf of Bavaria.  One of his\r\ndescendants, called Henry the Lion, married Maud, daughter of Henry the\r\nSecond of England, and became the founder of the family of Brunswick.\r\nWar and imperial favor and imperial displeasure interfered during many\r\ngenerations with the integrity of the Duchy of Brunswick, and the\r\nElectorate of Hanover was made up for the most part out of territories\r\nwhich Brunswick had once owned.  The Emperor Leopold constructed it\r\nformally into an Electorate in 1692, with Ernest Augustus of\r\nBrunswick-Lüneberg as its first Elector.  The George Louis who now, in\r\n1714, is waiting to become King of England, was the son of Ernest\r\nAugustus and of Sophia, youngest daughter of Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of\r\nBohemia, sister to Charles First of England.  Elizabeth had married\r\nFrederick, the Elector-Palatine of the Rhine, and her life was crossed\r\nand thwarted by the opening of the Thirty Years' War, and then by the\r\nmisfortunes of her brother Charles and his dynasty.  Elizabeth survived\r\nthe English troubles and saw the Restoration, and came to live in {6}\r\nEngland, and to see her nephew, Charles the Second, reign as king.  She\r\nbarely saw this.  Two years after the Restoration she died in London.\r\nSophia was her twelfth child: she had thirteen in all.  One of Sophia's\r\nelder brothers was Prince Rupert--that \"Rupert of the Rhine\" of whom\r\nMacaulay's ballad says that \"Rupert never comes but to conquer or to\r\ndie\"--the Rupert whose daring and irresistible charges generally won\r\nhis half of the battle, only that the other half might be lost, and\r\nthat his success might be swallowed up in the ruin of his companions.\r\nHis headlong bravery was a misfortune rather than an advantage to his\r\ncause, and there seems to have been one instance--that of the surrender\r\nof Bristol--in which that bravery deserted him for the moment.  We see\r\nhim afterwards in the pages of Pepys, an uninteresting, prosaic,\r\npedantic figure, usefully employed in scientific experiments, and with\r\nall the gilt washed off him by time and years and the commonplace wear\r\nand tear of routine life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--The \"Princess of Ahlden\"]\r\n\r\nGeorge inherited none of the accomplishments of his mother.  His father\r\nwas a man of some talent and force of character, but he cared nothing\r\nfor books or education of any kind, and George was allowed to revel in\r\nignorance.  He had no particular merit except a certain easy\r\ngood-nature, which rendered him unwilling to do harm or to give pain to\r\nany one, unless some interest of his own should make it convenient.\r\nHis neglected and unrestrained youth was abandoned to license and to\r\nprofligacy.  He was married in the twenty-second year of his age,\r\nagainst his own inclination, to the Princess Sophia Dorothea of Zeil,\r\nwho was some six years younger.  The marriage was merely a political\r\none, formed with the object of uniting the whole of the Duchy of\r\nLüneberg.  George was attached to another girl; the princess is\r\nsupposed to have fixed her affections upon another man.  They were\r\nmarried, however, on November 21, 1682, and during all her life Sophia\r\nDorothea had to put up with the neglect, the contempt, and afterwards\r\nthe cruelty of {7} her husband.  George's strongest taste was for ugly\r\nwomen.  One of his favorites, Mademoiselle Schulemberg, maid of honor\r\nto his mother, and who was afterwards made Duchess of Kendal, was\r\nconspicuous, even in the unlovely Hanoverian court, for the awkwardness\r\nof her long, gaunt, fleshless figure.  Another favorite of George's,\r\nMadame Kilmansegge, afterwards made Countess of Darlington, represented\r\na different style of beauty.  She is described by Horace Walpole as\r\nhaving \"large, fierce, black eyes, rolling beneath lofty-arched\r\neyebrows, two acres of cheeks spread with crimson, an ocean of neck\r\nthat overflowed and was not distinguishable from the lower part of her\r\nbody, and no portion of which was restrained by stays.\"\r\n\r\nIt would not be surprising if the neglected Sophia Dorothea should have\r\nlooked for love elsewhere, or at least should not have been strict\r\nenough in repelling it when it offered itself.  Philip Christof\r\nKönigsmark, a Swedish soldier of fortune, was supposed to be her\r\nfavored lover.  He suffered for his amour, and it was said that his\r\ndeath came by the special order--one version has it by the very\r\nhand--of George the Elector, the owner of the ladies Schulemberg and\r\nKilmansegge.  Sophia Dorothea was banished for the rest of her life to\r\nthe Castle of Ahlden, on the river Aller.  In the old schloss of\r\nHanover the spot is still shown, outside the door of the Hall of\r\nKnights, which tradition has fixed upon as the spot where the\r\nassassination of Königsmark took place.\r\n\r\nThe Königsmarks were in their way a famous family.  The elder brother\r\nwas the Charles John Königsmark celebrated in an English State trial as\r\nthe man who planned and helped to carry out the murder of Thomas\r\nThynne.  Thomas Thynne, of Longleat, the accused of Titus Oates, the\r\n\"Wise Issachar,\" the \"wealthy Western friend\" of Dryden, the comrade of\r\nMonmouth, the \"Tom of Ten Thousand,\" of every one, was betrothed to\r\nElizabeth, the child widow--she was only fifteen years old--of Lord\r\nOgle.  Königsmark, fresh from love-making in {8} all the courts of\r\nEurope, and from fighting anything and everything from the Turk at\r\nTangiers to the wild bulls of Madrid, seems to have fallen in love with\r\nThynne's betrothed wife, and to have thought that the best way of\r\nobtaining her was to murder his rival.  The murder was done, and its\r\nstory is recorded in clumsy bas-relief over Thynne's tomb in\r\nWestminster Abbey.  Königsmark's accomplices were executed, but\r\nKönigsmark got off, and died years later fighting for the Venetians at\r\nthe siege of classic Argos.  The soldier in Virgil falls on a foreign\r\nfield, and, dying, remembers sweet Argos.  The elder Königsmark, dying\r\nbefore sweet Argos, ought of right to remember that spot where St.\r\nAlbans Street joins Pall Mall, and where Thynne was done to death.  The\r\nKönigsmarks had a sister, the beautiful Aurora, who was mistress of\r\nFrederick Augustus, Elector of Saxony, and so mother of the famous\r\nMaurice de Saxe, and ancestress of George Sand.  Later, like the fair\r\nsinner of some tale of chivalry, she ended her days in pious\r\nretirement, as prioress of the Protestant Abbey at Quedlinburg.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Wooden shoes and warming-pans]\r\n\r\nGeorge was born in Osnabrück, in May, 1660, and was therefore now in\r\nhis fifty-fifth year.  As his first qualification for the government of\r\nEngland, it may be mentioned that he did not understand one sentence of\r\nthe English language, was ignorant of English ways, history, and\r\ntraditions, and had as little sympathy with the growing sentiments of\r\nthe majority of educated English people as if he had been an Amurath\r\nsucceeding an Amurath.\r\n\r\nWhen George became Elector, on the death of his father in 1698, he\r\nshowed, however, some capacity for improvement, under the influence of\r\nthe new responsibility imposed upon him by his station.  His private\r\nlife did not amend, but his public conduct acquired a certain solidity\r\nand consistency which was not to have been expected from his previous\r\nmode of living.  One of his merits was not likely to be by any means a\r\nmerit in the eyes of the English people.  He was, to do him justice,\r\ndeeply attached to his native country.  He had all the {9} love for\r\nHanover that the cat has for the hearth to which it is accustomed.  The\r\nways of the place suited him; the climate, the soil, the whole\r\nconditions of life were exactly what he would have them to be.  He\r\nlived up to the age of fifty-four a contented, stolid, happy, dissolute\r\nElector of Hanover; and it was a complete disturbance to all his habits\r\nand his predilections when the expected death of Anne compelled him to\r\nturn his thoughts to England.\r\n\r\nThe other claimant of the English crown was James Frederick Edward\r\nStuart, the Old Pretender, as he came to be afterwards called by his\r\nenemies, the Chevalier de Saint George, as his friends called him when\r\nthey did not think it prudent to give him the title of king.  James was\r\nthe step-brother of Queen Anne.  He was the son of James the Second, by\r\nJames's second wife, Maria D'Este, sister to Francis, Duke of Modena.\r\nMaria was only the age of Juliet when she married: she had just passed\r\nher fourteenth year.  Unlike Juliet she was not beautiful; unlike\r\nJuliet she was poor.  She was, however, a devout Roman Catholic, and\r\ntherefore was especially acceptable to her husband.  She had four\r\nchildren in quick succession, all of whom died in infancy; and then for\r\nten years she had no child.  The _London Gazette_ surprised the world\r\none day by the announcement that the Queen had become pregnant, and\r\nupon June 10, 1688, she gave birth to a son.  It need hardly be told\r\nnow that the wildest commotion was raised by the birth of the prince.\r\nThe great majority of the Protestants insinuated, or stoutly declared,\r\nthat the alleged heir-apparent was not a child of the Queen.  The story\r\nwas that a newly-born child, the son of a poor miller, had been brought\r\ninto the Queen's room in a warming-pan, and passed off as the son of\r\nthe Queen.  It was said that Father Petre, a Catholic clergyman, had\r\nbeen instrumental in carrying out this contrivance, and therefore the\r\nenemies of the royal family talked of the young prince as Perkin or\r\nPetrelin.  The warming-pan was one of the most familiar objects in\r\nsatirical literature and art for many generations after.  {10} A whole\r\nschool of caricature was heated into life, if we may use such an\r\nexpression, by this fabulous warming-pan.  Warming-pans were associated\r\nwith brass money and wooden shoes in the mouths and minds of Whig\r\npartisans, down to a day not very far remote from our own.  Mr. Jobson,\r\nthe vulgar lawyer in Scott's \"Rob Roy,\" talks rudely to Diana Vernon, a\r\nCatholic, about \"King William, of glorious and immortal memory, our\r\nimmortal deliverer from Papists and pretenders, and wooden shoes and\r\nwarming-pans.\"  \"Sad things those wooden shoes and warming-pans,\"\r\nretorted the young lady, who seemed to take pleasure in augmenting his\r\nwrath; \"and it is a comfort you don't seem to want a warming-pan at\r\npresent, Mr. Jobson.\"  There was not, of course, the slightest\r\nfoundation for the absurd story about the spurious heir to the throne.\r\nSome little excuse was given for the spread of such a tale by the mere\r\nfact that there had been delay in summoning the proper officials to be\r\npresent at the birth; but despite all the pains Bishop Burnet takes to\r\nmake the report seem trustworthy, it may be doubted whether any one\r\nwhose opinion was worth having seriously believed in the story, even at\r\nthe time, and it soon ceased to have any believers at all.  At the\r\ntime, however, it was accepted as an article of faith by a large\r\nproportion of the outer public; and the supposed Jesuit plot and the\r\nsupposed warming-pan served as missiles with which to pelt the\r\nsupporters of the Stuarts, until long after there had ceased to be the\r\nslightest chance whatever of a Stuart restoration.  This story of a\r\nspurious heir to a throne repeats itself at various intervals of\r\nhistory.  The child of Napoleon the First and Maria Louisa was believed\r\nby many Legitimist partisans to be supposititious.  In our own days\r\nthere were many intelligent persons in France firmly convinced that the\r\nunfortunate Prince Louis Napoleon, who was killed in Zululand, was not\r\nthe son of the Empress of the French, but that he was the son of her\r\nsister, the Duchess of Alva, and that he was merely palmed off on the\r\nFrench {11} people in order to secure the stability of the Bonapartist\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--The \"Old Pretender\"]\r\n\r\nJames Stuart was born, as we have said, on June 10, 1688, and was\r\ntherefore still in his twenty-sixth year at the time when this history\r\nbegins.  Soon after his birth his mother hurried with him to France to\r\nescape the coming troubles, and his father presently followed\r\ndiscrowned.  He had led an unhappy life--unhappy all the more because\r\nof the incessant dissipation with which he tried to enliven it.  He is\r\ndescribed as tall, meagre, and melancholy.  Although not strikingly\r\nlike Charles the First or Charles the Second, he had unmistakably the\r\nStuart aspect.  Horace Walpole said of him many years after that,\r\n\"without the particular features of any Stuart, the Chevalier has the\r\nstrong lines and fatality of air peculiar to them all.\"  The words\r\n\"fatality of air\" describe very expressively that look of melancholy\r\nwhich all the Stuart features wore when in repose.  The melancholy look\r\nrepresented an underlying habitual mood of melancholy, or even\r\ndespondency, which a close observer may read in the character of the\r\n\"merry monarch\" himself, for all his mirth and his dissipation, just as\r\nwell as in that of Charles the First or of James the Second.  The\r\nprofligacy of Charles the Second had little that was joyous in it.\r\nJames Stuart, the Chevalier, had not the abilities and the culture of\r\nCharles the Second, and he had much the same taste for intrigue and\r\ndissipation.  His amours were already beginning to be a scandal, and he\r\ndrank now and then like a man determined at all cost to drown thought.\r\nHe was always the slave of women.  Women knew all his secrets, and were\r\nmade acquainted with his projected political enterprises.  Sometimes\r\nthe fair favorite to whom he had unbosomed himself blabbed and tattled\r\nall over Versailles or Paris of what she had heard, and in some\r\ninstances, perhaps, she even took her newly-acquired knowledge to the\r\nEnglish Ambassador and disposed of it for a consideration.  At this\r\ntime James Stuart is not yet married; but marriage made as little {12}\r\ndifference in his way of living as it had done in that of his elderly\r\npolitical rival, George the Elector.  It is strange that James Stuart\r\nshould have made so faint an impression upon history and upon\r\nliterature.  Romance and poetry, which have done so much for his son,\r\n\"Bonnie Prince Charlie,\" have taken hardly any account of him.  He\r\nfigures in Thackeray's \"Esmond,\" but the picture is not made very\r\ndistinct, even by that master of portraiture, and the merely frivolous\r\nside of his character is presented with disproportionate prominence.\r\nJames Stuart had stronger qualities for good or evil than Thackeray\r\nseems to have found in him.  Some of his contemporaries denied him the\r\ncredit of man's ordinary courage; he has even been accused of positive\r\ncowardice; but there does not seem to be the slightest ground for such\r\nan accusation.  Studied with the severest eye, his various enterprises,\r\nand the manner in which he bore himself throughout them, would seem to\r\nprove that he had courage enough for any undertaking.  Princes seldom\r\nshow any want of physical courage.  They are trained from their very\r\nbirth to regard themselves as always on parade; and even if they should\r\nfeel their hearts give way in presence of danger, they are not likely\r\nto allow it to be seen.  It was not lack of personal bravery that\r\nmarred the chances of James Stuart.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Anne's sympathies]\r\n\r\nIt is only doing bare justice to one whose character and career have\r\nmet with little favor from history, contemporary or recent, to say that\r\nJames might have made his way to the throne with comparative ease if he\r\nwould only consent to change his religion and become a Protestant.  It\r\nwas again and again pressed upon him by English adherents, and even by\r\nstatesmen in power--by Oxford and by Bolingbroke--that if he could not\r\nactually become a Protestant he should at least pretend to become one,\r\nand give up all outward show of his devotion to the Catholic Church.\r\nJames steadily and decisively refused to be guilty of any meanness so\r\nignoble and detestable.  His conduct in thus adhering to his\r\nconvictions, even at {13} the cost of a throne, has been contrasted\r\nwith that of Henry the Fourth, who declared Paris to be \"well worth a\r\nmass!\"  But some injustice has been done to Henry the Fourth in regard\r\nto his conversion.  Henry's great Protestant minister, Sully, urged him\r\nto become an open and professing Catholic, on the ground that he had\r\nalways been a Catholic more or less consciously and in his heart.\r\nSully gave Henry several evidences, drawn from his observation of\r\nHenry's own demeanor, to prove to him that his natural inclinations and\r\nthe turn of his intellect always led him towards the Catholic faith,\r\ncommenting shrewdly on the fact that he had seen Henry cross himself\r\nmore than once on the field of battle in the presence of danger.  Thus,\r\naccording to Sully, Henry the Fourth, in professing himself a Catholic,\r\nwould be only following the bent of his own natural inclinations.\r\nHowever that may be, it is still the fact that Henry the Fourth, by\r\nchanging his profession of religion, succeeded in obtaining a crown,\r\nand that James the Pretender, by refusing to hear of such a change,\r\nlost his best chance of a throne.\r\n\r\nWhat were Anne's own inclinations with regard to the succession?  There\r\ncannot be much doubt as to the way her personal feelings went.  There\r\nis a history of the reign of Queen Anne, written by Dr. Thomas\r\nSomerville, \"one of His Majesty's Chaplains in Ordinary,\" and published\r\nin 1798, with a dedication \"by permission\" to the King.  It is called\r\non its title-page \"The History of Great Britain during the Reign of\r\nQueen Anne, with a Dissertation Concerning the Danger of the Protestant\r\nSuccession.\"  Such an author, writing comparatively soon after the\r\nevents, and in a book dedicated to the reigning king, was not likely to\r\ndo any conscious injustice to the memory of Queen Anne, and was\r\nespecially likely to take a fair view of the influence which her\r\npersonal inclinations were calculated to have on the succession.  Dr.\r\nSomerville declares with great justice that \"mildness, timidity, and\r\nanxiety were constitutional ingredients in the temper\" of Queen Anne.\r\nThis very timidity, this very anxiety, {14} appears, according to Dr.\r\nSomerville's judgment, to have worked favorably for the Hanoverian\r\nsuccession.  [Sidenote: 1714--James the Third] The Queen herself, by\r\nsentiment, and by what may be called a sort of superstition, leaned\r\nmuch towards the Stuarts.  \"The loss,\" says Dr. Somerville, \"of all her\r\nchildren bore the aspect of an angry Providence adjusting punishment to\r\nthe nature and quality of her offence.\"  Her offence, of course, was\r\nthe part she had taken in helping to dethrone her father.  \"Wounded in\r\nspirit, and prone to superstition, she naturally thought of the\r\nrestitution of the crown to her brother as the only atonement she could\r\nmake to the memory of her injured father.\"  This feeling might have\r\nripened into action with her but for that constitutional timidity and\r\nanxiety of which Somerville speaks.  There would undoubtedly have been\r\ndangers, obvious to even the bravest or the most reckless, in an\r\nattempt just then to alter the succession; but Anne saw those dangers\r\n\"in the most terrific form, and recoiled with horror from the sight.\"\r\nMoreover, she had a constitutional objection, as strong as that of\r\nQueen Elizabeth herself, to the presence of an intended successor near\r\nher throne.  \"She trembled,\" says Somerville, \"at the idea of the\r\npresence of a successor, whoever he might be; and the residence of her\r\nown brother in England was not less dreadful to her than that of the\r\nelectoral prince.\"  But it is probable that had she lived longer she\r\nwould have found herself constrained to put up with the presence either\r\nof one claimant or the other.  Her ministers, whoever they might be,\r\nwould surely have seen the imperative necessity of bringing over to\r\nEngland the man whom the Queen and they had determined to present to\r\nthe English people as the destined heir of the throne.  In such an\r\nevent as that, and most assuredly if men like Bolingbroke had been in\r\npower, it may be taken for granted that the Queen would have preferred\r\nher own brother, a Stuart, to the Electoral Prince of Hanover.  \"What\r\nthe consequence might have been, if the Queen had survived,\" says\r\nSomerville, \"is merely a matter of conjecture; but we may {15}\r\npronounce, with some degree of assurance, that the Protestant interest\r\nwould have been exposed to more certain and to more imminent dangers\r\nthan ever had threatened it before at any period since the revolution.\"\r\nThis seems a reasonable and just assertion.  If Anne had lived much\r\nlonger, it is possible that England might have seen a James the Third.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{16}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPARTIES AND LEADERS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Whig and Tory]\r\n\r\nAll the closing months of Queen Anne's reign were occupied by Whigs and\r\nTories, and indeed by Anne herself as well, in the invention and\r\nconduct of intrigues about the succession.  The Queen herself, with the\r\ngrave opening before her, kept her fading eyes turned, not to the world\r\nshe was about to enter, but to the world she was about to leave.  She\r\nwas thinking much more about the future of her throne than about her\r\nown soul and future state.  The Whigs were quite ready to maintain the\r\nHanoverian succession by force.  They did not expect to be able to\r\ncarry matters easily, and they were ready to encounter a civil war.\r\nTheir belief seems to have been that they and not their opponents would\r\nhave to strike the blow, and they had already summoned the Duke of\r\nMarlborough from his retirement in Flanders to take the lead in their\r\nmovement.  Having Marlborough, they knew that they would have the army.\r\nOn the other hand, if Bolingbroke and the Tories really had any actual\r\nhope of a restoration of the Stuarts, it is certain that up to the last\r\nmoment they had made no substantial preparations to accomplish their\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs and Tories divided between them whatever political force\r\nthere was in English society at this time.  Outside both parties lay a\r\nconsiderable section of people who did not distinctly belong to the one\r\nfaction or the other, but were ready to incline now to this and now to\r\nthat, according as the conditions of the hour might inspire them.\r\nOutside these again, and far outnumbering these and all others\r\ncombined, was the great mass of the English {17} people--hard-working,\r\nmuch-suffering, poor, patient, and almost absolutely indifferent to\r\nchanges in governments and the humors and struggles of parties.  \"These\r\nwrangling jars of Whig and Tory,\" says Dean Swift, \"are stale and old\r\nas Troy-town story.\"  But if the principles were old, the titles of the\r\nparties were new.  Steele, in 1710, published in the _Tatler_ a letter\r\nfrom Pasquin of Rome to Isaac Bickerstaff, asking for \"an account of\r\nthose two religious orders which have lately sprung up amongst you, the\r\nWhigs and the Tories.\"  Steele declared that you could not come even\r\namong women \"but you find them divided into Whig and Tory.\"  It was\r\nlike the famous lawsuit in Abdera, alluded to by Lucian and amplified\r\nby Wieland, concerning the ownership of the ass's shadow, on which all\r\nthe Abderites took sides, and every one was either a \"Shadow\" or an\r\n\"Ass.\"\r\n\r\nVarious explanations have been given of these titles Whig and Tory.\r\nTitus Oates applied the term \"Tory,\" which then signified an Irish\r\nrobber, to those who would not believe in his Popish plot, and the name\r\ngradually became extended to all who were supposed to have sympathy\r\nwith the Catholic Duke of York.  The word \"Whig\" first arose during the\r\nCameronian rising, when it was applied to the Scotch Presbyterians, and\r\nis derived by some from the whey which they habitually drank, and by\r\nothers from a word, \"whiggam,\" used by the western Scottish drovers.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs and the Tories represent in the main not only two political\r\ndoctrines, but two different feelings in the human mind.  The natural\r\ntendency of some men is to regard political liberty as of more\r\nimportance than political authority, and of other men to think that the\r\nmaintenance of authority is the first object to be secured, and that\r\nonly so much of individual liberty is to be conceded as will not\r\ninterfere with authority's strictest exercise.  Roughly speaking,\r\ntherefore, the Tories were for authority, and the Whigs for liberty.\r\nThe Tories naturally held to the principle of the monarchy and of the\r\nState church; the Whigs {18} were inclined for the supremacy of\r\nParliament, and for something like an approach to religious equality.\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Political change] Up to this time at least the Tory\r\nparty still accepted the theory of the Divine origin of the king's\r\nsupremacy.  The Whigs were even then the advocates of a constitutional\r\nsystem, and held that the people at large were the source of\r\nmonarchical power.  To the one set of men the sovereign was a divinely\r\nappointed ruler; to the other he was the hereditary chief of the realm,\r\nhaving the source of his authority in popular election.  The Tories, as\r\nthe Church party, disliked the Dissenters even more than they disliked\r\nthe Roman Catholics.  The Whigs were then even inclined to regard the\r\nChurch as a branch of the Civil Service--to adopt a much more modern\r\nphrase--and they were in favor of extending freedom of worship to\r\nDissenters, and in a certain sense to Roman Catholics.  According to\r\nBishop Burnet, it was in the reign of Queen Anne that the distinction\r\nbetween High-Church and Low-Church first marked itself out, and we find\r\nalmost as a natural necessity that the High-Churchmen were Tories, and\r\nthe Low-Churchmen were Whigs.  Then as now the chief strength of the\r\nTories was found in the country, and not in the large towns.  So far as\r\ntown populations were concerned, the Tories were proportionately\r\nstrongest where the borough was smallest.  The great bulk of the\r\nagricultural population, so far as it had definite political feelings,\r\nwas distinctly Tory.  The strength of the Whigs lay in the\r\nmanufacturing towns and the great ports.  London was at that time much\r\nstronger in its Liberal political sentiments than it has been more\r\nrecently.  The moneyed interest, the bankers, the merchants, were\r\nattached to the Whig party.  Many peers and bishops were Whigs, but\r\nthey were chiefly the peers and bishops who owed their appointments to\r\nWilliam the Third.  The French envoy, D'Iberville, at this time\r\ndescribes the Whigs as having at their command the best purses, the\r\nbest swords, the ablest heads, and the handsomest women.  The Tory\r\nparty was strong at the University of Oxford; the Whig party was {19}\r\nin greater force at Cambridge.  Both Whigs and Tories, however, were in\r\na somewhat subdued condition of mind about the time that Anne's reign\r\nwas closing.  Neither party as a whole was inclined to push its\r\npolitical principles to anything like a logical extreme.  Whigs and\r\nTories alike were practically satisfied with the form which the English\r\ngoverning system had put on after the Revolution of 1688.  Neither\r\nparty was inclined for another revolution.  The civil war had carried\r\nthe Whig principle a little too far for the Whigs.  The Restoration had\r\nbrought a certain amount of scandal on sovereign authority and the\r\nprinciple of Divine right.  The minds of men were settling down into\r\nwillingness for a compromise.  There were, of course, among the Tories\r\nthe extreme party, so pledged to the restoration of the Stuarts that\r\nthey would have moved heaven and earth, at all events they would have\r\nconvulsed England, for the sake of bringing them back.  These men\r\nconstituted what would now be called in the language of French politics\r\nthe Extreme Right of the Tory party; they would become of importance at\r\nany hour when some actual movement was made from the outside to restore\r\nthe Stuarts.  Such a movement would of course have carried with it and\r\nwith them the great bulk of the new quiescent Tory party; but in the\r\nmean time, and until some such movement was made, the Jacobite section\r\nof the Tories was not in a condition to be active or influential, and\r\nwas not a serious difficulty in the way of the Hanoverian succession.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs had great advantages on their side.  They had a clear\r\nprinciple to start with.  The constitutional errors and excesses of the\r\nStuarts had forced on the mind of England a recognition of the two or\r\nthree main principles of civil and religious liberty.  The Whigs knew\r\nwhat they wanted better than the Tories did, and the ends which the\r\nWhigs proposed to gain were attainable, while those which the Tories\r\nset out for themselves were to a great extent lost in dream-land.  The\r\nuncertainty and vagueness of many of the Tory aims made some of the\r\n{20} Tories themselves only half earnest in their purposes.  Many a\r\nTory who talked as loudly as his brothers about the king having his own\r\nagain, and who toasted \"the king over the water\" as freely as they, had\r\nin the bottom of his heart very little real anxiety to see a rebellion\r\nend in a Stuart restoration.  But, on the other hand, the Whigs could\r\nstrive with all their might and main to carry out their principles in\r\nChurch and in State without the responsibility of plunging the country\r\ninto rebellion, and without any dread of seeing their projects melt\r\naway into visions and chimeras.  A great band of landed proprietors\r\nformed the leaders of the Whigs.  Times have changed since then, and\r\nthe representatives of some of those great houses which then led the\r\nWhig party have passed or glided insensibly into the ranks of the\r\nTories; but the main reason for this is because a Tory of our day\r\nrepresents fairly enough, in certain political aspects, the Whig of the\r\ndays of Queen Anne.  What is called in American politics a new\r\ndeparture has taken place in England since that time; the Radical party\r\nhas come into existence with political principles and watchwords quite\r\ndifferent even from those of the early Whigs.  Some of the Whig houses,\r\nnot many, have gone with the forward movement; some have remained\r\nbehind, and so lapsed almost insensibly into the Tory quarter.  But at\r\nthe close of Queen Anne's reign all the great leading Whigs stood well\r\ntogether.  They understood better than the Tories did the necessity of\r\nobtaining superior influence in the House of Commons.  They even\r\ncontrived at that time to secure the majority of the county\r\nconstituencies, while they had naturally the majority of the commercial\r\nclass on their side.  Then, as in later days, the vast wealth of the\r\nWhig families was spent unstintingly, and it may be said unblushingly,\r\nin securing the possession of the small constituencies, the\r\nconstituencies which were only to be had by liberal bribery.  Then, as\r\nafterwards, there was perceptible in the Whig party a strange\r\ncombination of dignity and of meanness, of great principles and of\r\nsomewhat degraded practices.  They had high {21} purposes; they\r\nrecognized noble principles, and they held to them; they were for\r\npolitical liberty as they then understood it, and they were for\r\nreligious equality--for such approach at least to religious equality as\r\nhad then come to be sanctioned by responsible politicians in England.\r\nThey were ready to make great sacrifices in defence of their political\r\ncreed.  But the principles and purposes with which they started, and to\r\nwhich they kept, did not succeed in purifying and ennobling all their\r\nparliamentary strategy and political conduct.  They intrigued, they\r\nbribed, they bought, they cajoled, they paltered, they threatened, they\r\nmade unsparing use of money and of power, they employed every art to\r\ncarry out high and national purposes which the most unscrupulous cabal\r\ncould have used to secure the attainment of selfish and ignoble ends.\r\nTheir enemies had put one great advantage into their hands.  The\r\nconduct of Bolingbroke and of Oxford during recent years had left the\r\nWhigs the sole representatives of constitutional liberty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Anarchy or \"Perkin\"]\r\n\r\nThe two great political parties hated and denounced each other with a\r\nferocity hardly known before, and hardly possible in our later times.\r\nThe Whigs vituperated the Tories as rebels and traitors; the Tories\r\ncried out against the Whigs as the enemies of religion and the\r\nopponents of \"the true Church of England.\"  Many a ballad of that time\r\ndescribed the Whigs as men whose object it was to destroy both mitre\r\nand crown, to introduce anarchy once again, as they had done in the\r\ndays of Oliver Cromwell.  The Whig balladists retorted by describing\r\nthe Tories as men who were engaged in trying to bring in \"Perkin\" from\r\nFrance, and prophesied the halter as a reward of their leading\r\nstatesmen.  In truth, the bitterness of that hour was very earnest;\r\nmost of the men on both sides meant what they said.  Either side, if it\r\nhad been in complete preponderance, would probably have had very little\r\nscruple in disposing of its leading enemies by means of the halter or\r\nthe prison.  It was for the time not so much a struggle of political\r\nparties as a {22} struggle of hostile armies.  The men were serious and\r\nsavage, because the crisis was serious and portentous.  The chances of\r\nan hour might make a man a prime-minister or a prisoner.  Bolingbroke\r\nsoon after was in exile, and Walpole at the head of the administration.\r\nThe slightest chance, the merest accident, might have sent Walpole into\r\nexile, and put Bolingbroke at the head of the State.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--John Churchill]\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the English public were at this moment turned in especial\r\nto watch the movements of two men--the Duke of Marlborough and Lord\r\nBolingbroke.  Marlborough was beyond question the greatest soldier of\r\nhis time.  He had gone into exile when Queen Anne consented to degrade\r\nhim and to persecute him, and now he was on his way home, at the urgent\r\nentreaty of the Whig leaders, in order to lend his powerful influence\r\nto the Hanoverian cause.\r\n\r\nThe character of the Duke of Marlborough is one which ought to be\r\nespecially attractive to the authors of romance and the lovers of\r\nstrong, bold portrait-painting.  One peculiar difficulty, however, a\r\nromancist would have in dealing with Marlborough--he could hardly\r\nventure to paint Marlborough as nature and fortune made him.  The\r\nromancist would find himself compelled to soften and to modify many of\r\nthe distinctive traits of Marlborough's character, in order that he\r\nmight not seem the mere inventor of a human paradox, in order that he\r\nmight not appear to be indulging in the fantastic and the impossible.\r\nPope has called Bacon \"the wisest, brightest, meanest of mankind,\" but\r\nBacon was not greater in his own path than Marlborough in his, and\r\nBacon's worst meannesses were nobility itself compared with some of\r\nMarlborough's political offences.  Marlborough started in life with\r\nalmost every advantage that man could have--with genius, with boundless\r\ncourage, with personal beauty, with favoring friends.  From his early\r\nyouth he had been attached to James the Second and James the Second's\r\ncourt.  One of Marlborough's {23} biographers even suggests that the\r\nDuchess of York, James's first wife, was needlessly fond of young\r\nChurchill.  The beautiful Duchess of Cleveland--she of whom Pepys said\r\n\"that everything she did became her\"--was passionately in love with\r\nMarlborough, and, according to some writers, gave him his first start\r\nin life when she presented him with five thousand pounds, which\r\nMarlborough, prudent then as ever, invested in an annuity of five\r\nhundred a year.  Burnet said of him that \"he knew the arts of living in\r\na court beyond any man in it; he caressed all people with a soft and\r\nobliging deportment, and was always ready to do good offices.\"  His\r\nonly personal defect was in his voice, which was shrill and\r\ndisagreeable.  He was, through all his life, avaricious to the last\r\ndegree; he grasped at money wherever he could get it; he took money\r\nfrom women as well as from men.  A familiar story of the time\r\nrepresents another nobleman as having been mistaken for the Duke of\r\nMarlborough by a mob, at a time when Marlborough was unpopular, and\r\nextricating himself from the difficulty by telling the crowd he could\r\nnot possibly be the Duke of Marlborough, first, because he had only two\r\nguineas in his pocket, and next, because he was perfectly ready to give\r\nthem away.  Marlborough had received the highest favors from James the\r\nSecond, but he quitted James in the hour of his misfortunes, only,\r\nhowever, it should be said, to return secretly to his service at a time\r\nwhen he was professing devotion to William the Third.  He betrayed each\r\nside to the other.  In the same year, and almost in the same month, he\r\nwrites to the Elector at Hanover and to the Pretender in France,\r\npouring forth to each alike his protestations of devotion.  \"I shall be\r\nalways ready to hazard my fortune and my life for your service,\" he\r\ntells the Elector.  \"I had rather have my hands cut off than do\r\nanything prejudicial to King James's cause,\" he tells an agent of the\r\nStuarts.  James appears to have believed in Marlborough, and William,\r\nwhile he made use of him, to have had no faith in him.  \"The Duke of\r\nMarlborough,\" William {24} said, \"has the best talents for a general of\r\nany man in England; but he is a vile man and I hate him, for though I\r\ncan profit by treasons I cannot bear the traitor.\"  William's saying\r\nwas strikingly like that one ascribed to Philip of Macedon.  Schomberg\r\nspoke of Marlborough as \"the first lieutenant-general whom I ever\r\nremember to have deserted his colors.\"  Lord Granard, who was in the\r\ncamp of King James the Second on Salisbury Plain, told Dr. King, who\r\nhas recorded the story, that Churchill and some other colonels invited\r\nLord Granard to supper, and opened to him their design of deserting to\r\nthe Prince of Orange.  Granard not merely refused to enter into the\r\nconspiracy, but went to the King and told him the whole story, advising\r\nhim to seize Marlborough and the other conspirators.  Perhaps if this\r\nadvice had been followed, King William would never have come to the\r\nthrone of England.  James, however, gave no credit to the story, and\r\ntook no trouble about it.  Next morning he found his mistake; but it\r\nwas then too late.  The truth of this story is corroborated by other\r\nauthorities, one of them being King James himself, who afterwards\r\nstated that he had received information of Lord Churchill's designs,\r\nand was recommended to seize his person, but that he unfortunately\r\nneglected to avail himself of the advice.  \"Speak of that no more,\"\r\nsays Egmont, in Goethe's play; \"I _was_ warned.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Marlborough]\r\n\r\nSwift said of Marlborough that \"he is as covetous as hell, and\r\nambitious as the prince of it.\"  Marlborough was as ignorant as he was\r\navaricious.  Literary taste or instinct he must have had, because he\r\nread with so much eagerness the historical plays of Shakespeare, and\r\nindeed frankly owned that his only knowledge of English history was\r\ntaken from their scenes.  Even in that time of loose spelling his\r\nspelling is remarkably loose.  He seems to spell without any particular\r\nprinciple in the matter, seldom rendering the same word a second time\r\nby the same combination of letters.  He was at one period of his life a\r\nlibertine of the loosest order, so far as morals were {25} concerned,\r\nbut of the shrewdest kind as regarded personal gain and advancement.\r\nHe would have loved any Lady Bellaston who presented herself, and who\r\ncould have rewarded him for his kindness.  He was not of the type of\r\nByron's \"Don Juan,\" who declares that\r\n\r\n  The prisoned eagle will not pair, nor I\r\n  Serve a Sultana's sensual phantasy.\r\n\r\nMarlborough would have served any phantasy for gain.  It has been said\r\nof him that the reason for his being so successful with women as a\r\nyoung man was that he took money of them.  Yet, as another striking\r\ninstance of the paradoxical nature of his character, he was intensely\r\ndevoted to his wife.  He was the true lover of Sarah Jennings, who\r\nafterwards became Duchess of Marlborough.  A man of the most undaunted\r\ncourage in the presence of the enemy, he was his wife's obedient,\r\npatient, timid slave.  He lived more absolutely under her control than\r\nBelisarius under the government of his unscrupulous helpmate.  Sarah\r\nJennings was, in her way, almost as remarkable as her husband.  She was\r\na woman of great beauty.  Colley Gibber, in his \"Apology,\" pays devoted\r\ntestimony to her charms.  He had by chance to attend on her in the\r\ncapacity of a sort of amateur lackey at an entertainment in Nottingham,\r\nand he seems to have been completely dazzled by her loveliness.  \"If so\r\nclear an emanation of beauty, such a commanding grace of aspect, struck\r\nme into a regard that had something softer than the most profound\r\nrespect in it, I cannot see why I may not without offence remember it,\r\nsince beauty, like the sun, must sometimes lose its power to choose,\r\nand shine into equal warmth the peasant and the courtier.\"  He quaintly\r\nadds, \"However presumptuous or impertinent these thoughts may have\r\nappeared at my first entertaining them, why may I not hope that my\r\nhaving kept them decently a secret for full fifty years may be now a\r\ngood round plea for their pardon?\"  The imperious spirit which could\r\nrule Churchill long dominated the feeble nature of Queen Anne.  But\r\n{26} when once this domination was overthrown, Sarah Jennings had no\r\nart to curb her temper into such show of respect and compliance as\r\nmight have won back her lost honors.  She met her humiliation with the\r\nmost childish bursts of passion; she did everything in her power to\r\nannoy and insult the Queen who had passed from her haughty control.\r\nShe was always a keen hater; to the last day of her life she never\r\nforgot her resentment towards all who had, or who she thought had,\r\ninjured her.  In long later years she got into unseemly lawsuits with\r\nher own near relations.  But if one side of her character was harsh and\r\nunlovely enough, it may be admitted that there was something not\r\nunheroic about her unyielding spirit--something noble in the respect to\r\nher husband's memory, which showed itself in the declaration that she\r\nwould not marry \"the emperor of the world,\" after having been the wife\r\nof John, Duke of Marlborough.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Bolingbroke]\r\n\r\nHenry St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke, was in his way as great a man as\r\nthe Duke of Marlborough.  At the time we are now describing he seemed\r\nto have passed through a long, a varied, and a brilliant career, and\r\nyet he had only arrived at the age when public men in England now begin\r\nto be regarded as responsible politicians.  He was in his thirty-sixth\r\nyear.  The career that had prematurely begun was drawing to its\r\npremature close.  He had climbed to his highest position; he is\r\nPrime-minister of England, and has managed to get rid of his old\r\ncolleague and rival, Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford.  Bolingbroke had\r\nalmost every gift and grace that nature and fortune could give.  Three\r\nyears before this Swift wrote to Stella, \"I think Mr. St. John the\r\ngreatest young man I ever knew; wit, capacity, beauty, quickness of\r\napprehension, good learning and an excellent taste; the greatest orator\r\nin the House of Commons, admirable conversation, good nature and good\r\nmanners, generous, and a despiser of money.\"  Yet, as in the fairy\r\nstory, the benign powers which had combined to endow him so richly had\r\nwithheld the one gift which might have made all the rest of {27}\r\nsurpassing value, and which being denied left them of little account.\r\nIf Bolingbroke had had principle he would have been one of the greatest\r\nEnglishmen of any time.  His utter want of morality in politics, as\r\nwell as in private life, proved fatal to him; he only climbed high in\r\norder to fall the lower.  He was remarkable for profligacy even in that\r\nheedless and profligate time.  Voltaire, in one of his letters, tells a\r\nstory of a famous London courtesan who exclaimed to some of her\r\ncompanion nymphs on hearing that Bolingbroke had been made Secretary of\r\nState, \"Seven thousand guineas a year, girls, and all for us!\"  Even if\r\nthe story be not true it is interesting and significant as an evidence\r\nof the sort of impression which Bolingbroke had made upon his age.  It\r\nwas his glory to be vicious; he was proud of his orgies.  He liked to\r\nbe known as a man who could spend the whole night in a drunken revel,\r\nand the afternoon in preparing some despatch on which the fortunes of\r\nhis country or the peace of the world might depend.  The sight of a\r\nbeautiful woman could turn him away for the time from the gravest\r\npolitical purposes.  He was ready at such a moment to throw anything\r\nover for the sake of the sudden love-chase which had come in his way.\r\nHe bragged of his amours, and boasted that he had never failed of\r\nsuccess with any woman who seemed to him worth pursuing.  Like Faust,\r\nhe loved to reel from desire to enjoyment, and from enjoyment back\r\nagain into desire.  Bolingbroke was the first of a great line of\r\nparliamentary debaters who have made for themselves a distinct place in\r\nEnglish history, and whose rivals are not to be found in the history of\r\nany other parliament.  It is difficult at this time to form any\r\nadequate idea of Bolingbroke's style as a speaker or his capacity for\r\ndebate when compared with other great English parliamentary orators.\r\nBut so far as one may judge, we should be inclined to think that he\r\nmust have had Fox's readiness without Fox's redundancy and repetition;\r\nand that he must have had the stately diction and the commanding style\r\nof the younger Pitt, with a certain freshness and force which {28} the\r\nyounger Pitt did not always exhibit.  Bolingbroke's English prose style\r\nis hardly surpassed by that of any other author, either before his time\r\nor since.  It is supple, strong, and luminous; not redundant, but not\r\nbare; ornamented where ornament is suitable and even useful, but\r\nnowhere decorated with the purple rags of unnecessary and artificial\r\nbrilliancy.  Such a man, so gifted, must in any case have held a high\r\nplace among his contemporaries, and probably if Bolingbroke had\r\npossessed the political and personal virtues of men like Burke and\r\nPitt, or even the political virtues of a man like Charles Fox, he would\r\nhave been remembered as the greatest of all English parliamentary\r\nstatesmen.  But, as we have already said, the one defect filled him\r\nwith faults.  The lack of principle gave him a lack of purpose, and\r\nwanting purpose he persevered in no consistent political path.  Swift\r\nhas observed that Bolingbroke \"had a great respect for the characters\r\nof Alcibiades and Petronius, especially the latter, whom he would\r\ngladly be thought to resemble.\"  He came nearer at his worst to\r\nPetronius than at his best to Alcibiades.  Alcibiades, to do him\r\njustice, admired and understood virtue in others, however small the\r\nshare of it he contrived to keep for himself.  It is impossible to read\r\nthat wonderful compound of dramatic humor and philosophic thought,\r\nPlato's \"Banquet,\" without being moved by the generous and impassioned\r\neulogy which Alcibiades, in the fulness of his heart and of his wine,\r\npours out upon the austere virtue of Socrates.  Such as Alcibiades is\r\nthere described we may suppose Alcibiades to have been, and no one who\r\nhas followed the career of Bolingbroke can believe it possible that he\r\never could have felt any sincere admiration for virtue in man or woman,\r\nor could have thought of it otherwise than as a thing to be sneered at\r\nand despised.  The literary men, and more especially the poets of the\r\ndays of Bolingbroke, seem to have had as little scruple in their\r\ncompliments as a French _petit-maître_ might have in sounding the\r\npraises of his mistress to his mistress's ears.  Pope talks of his\r\nvilla, where, \"nobly {29} pensive, St. John sat and thought,\" and\r\ndeclared that such only might\r\n\r\n        Tread this sacred floor\r\n  Who dare to love their country and be poor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Pope's praises]\r\n\r\nIt is hard to think of Bolingbroke, even in his more advanced years, as\r\n\"nobly pensive,\" sitting and thinking, and certainly neither\r\nBolingbroke nor any of Bolingbroke's closer political associates was\r\nexactly the sort of man who would have dared \"to love his country and\r\nbe poor.\"  In Bolingbroke's latest years we hear of him as amusing\r\nhimself by boasting to his second wife of his various successful\r\namours, until at last the lady, weary of the repetition, somewhat\r\ncontemptuously reminds him that however happy as a lover he may have\r\nbeen once, his days of love were now over, and the less he said about\r\nit the better.\r\n\r\nNor was Pope less extravagant in his praise to Harley than to St. John.\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n      If aught below the seats divine\r\n  Can touch immortals, 'tis a soul like thine;\r\n  A soul supreme, in each hard instance tried,\r\n  Above all pain, all passion, and all pride,\r\n  The rage of power, the blast of public breath,\r\n  The lust of lucre, and the dread of death.\r\n\r\nThese lines, it is right to remember, were addressed to Harley, not in\r\nhis power, but after his fall.  Even with that excuse for a friend's\r\novercharged eulogy, they read like a satire on Harley rather than like\r\nhis panegyric.  Caricature itself could not more broadly distort the\r\nfeatures of a human being than his poetic admirer has altered the\r\nlineaments of Oxford.  Harley had been intriguing on both sides of the\r\nfield.  He professed devoted loyalty to the Queen and to her appointed\r\nsuccessor, and he was at the same time coquetting, to put it mildly,\r\nwith the Stuart family in France.  Nothing surprises a reader more than\r\nthe universal duplicity that seems to have prevailed in the days of\r\nAnne and of the early Georges.  Falsehood appears to have been a\r\nrecognized diplomatic {30} and political art.  Statesmen, even of the\r\nhighest rank and reputation, made no concealment of the fact that\r\nwhenever occasion required they were ready to state the thing which was\r\nnot, either in private conversation or in public debate.  Nothing could\r\nexceed or excuse the boundless duplicity of Marlborough, but it must be\r\nowned that even William the Third told almost as many falsehoods to\r\nMarlborough as Marlborough could have told to him.  At a time when\r\nWilliam detested Marlborough, he yet occasionally paid him in public\r\nand in private the very highest compliments on his integrity and his\r\nvirtue.  Men were not then supposed or expected to speak the truth.  A\r\nstatesman might deceive a foreign minister or the Parliament of his own\r\ncountry with as little risk to his reputation as a lady would have\r\nundergone, in later days, who told a lie to the custom-house officer at\r\nthe frontier to save the piece of smuggled lace in her trunk.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Harley]\r\n\r\nIf a man like William of Nassau could stoop to deceit and falsehood for\r\nany political purpose, it is easy to understand that a man like Harley\r\nwould make free use of the same arts, and for personal objects as well.\r\nHarley's political changes were so many and so rapid that they could\r\nnot possibly be explained by any theory consistent with sincerity.  It\r\nwas well said of him that \"his humor is never to deal clearly or\r\nopenly, but always with reserve, if not dissimulation, and to love\r\ntricks when not necessary, but from an inward satisfaction in\r\napplauding his own cunning.\"  He entered Parliament in 1689, and in\r\n1700 was chosen Speaker of the House of Commons.  At that time, and for\r\nlong after, it was not an uncommon thing that a man who had been\r\nSpeaker should afterwards become a Secretary of State, sitting in the\r\nsame House.  This was Harley's case: in 1704 he was made principal\r\nSecretary of State.  In 1708 Harley resigned office, and immediately\r\nafter took the leadership of the Tory party.  In about two years he\r\noverthrew the Whig administration, and became the head of a new\r\ngovernment, with the place of Lord High Treasurer, and the title of\r\nEarl of Oxford.  {31} His craft seems only to have been that low kind\r\nof artifice which enables an unscrupulous man to cajole his followers\r\nand to stir up division among his enemies.  His word was not to be\r\nrelied upon by friend or enemy, and when he most affected a tone of\r\nfrankness or of candor he was least to be trusted.  As Lord Stanhope\r\nwell says of him \"His slender and pliant intellect was well fitted to\r\ncrawl up to the heights of power through all the crooked mazes and\r\ndirty by-paths of intrigue; but having once attained the pinnacle, its\r\nsmallness and meanness were exposed to all the world.\"  Even his\r\nprivate life had not the virtues which one who reads some of the\r\nexalted panegyrics paid to him by contemporary poets and others would\r\nbe apt to imagine.  He was fond of drink and fond of pleasure in a\r\nsmall and secret way; his vices were as unlike the daring and brilliant\r\nprofligacy of his colleague and rival Bolingbroke as his intellect was\r\ninferior to Bolingbroke's surpassing genius.  For all Pope's poetic\r\neulogy, the poet could say in prose of Lord Oxford that he was not a\r\nvery capable minister, and had a good deal of negligence into the\r\nbargain.  \"He used to send trifling verses from court to the Scriblerus\r\nClub every day, and would come and talk idly with them almost every\r\nnight, even when his all was at stake.\"  Pope adds that Oxford \"talked\r\nof business in so confused a manner that you did not know what he was\r\nabout, and everything he went to tell you was in the epic way, for he\r\nalways began in the middle.\"  Swift calls him \"the greatest\r\nprocrastinator in the world.\"  It is of Lord Oxford that the story is\r\noriginally told which has been told of so many statesmen here and in\r\nAmerica since his time.  Lord Oxford, according to Pope, invited Rowe,\r\nthe dramatic poet, to learn Spanish.  Rowe went to work, and studied\r\nSpanish under the impression that some appointment at the Spanish court\r\nwould follow.  When he returned to Harley and told him he had\r\naccomplished the task, Harley said, \"Then, Mr. Rowe, I envy you the\r\npleasure of reading 'Don Quixote' in the original.\"  Pope asks, \"Is not\r\nthat cruel?\"  But {32} others have held that it was unintentional on\r\nLord Oxford's part, and merely one of his unthinking oddities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Walpole]\r\n\r\nAnother man, fifteen years younger than Harley, a school-fellow at Eton\r\nof Bolingbroke, was rising slowly, surely, into prominence and power.\r\nAll the great part of his career is yet to come; but even already,\r\nwhile men were talking of Marlborough and Bolingbroke, they found\r\nthemselves compelled to give a place in their thoughts to Robert\r\nWalpole.  If Bolingbroke was the first, and perhaps the most brilliant,\r\nof the great line of parliamentary debaters who have made debate a\r\nmoving power in English history, Walpole was the first of that line of\r\nstatesmen who, sprung from the class of the \"Commoner,\" have become\r\nleaders of the English Parliament.  In position and in influence,\r\nalthough not in personal character or accomplishments, Walpole may be\r\ndescribed as the direct predecessor of Peel and Gladstone.  Just two\r\nyears before the death of William the Third, Walpole entered Parliament\r\nfor the first time.  He married, entered Parliament, and succeeded to\r\nhis father's estates in the same year, 1700.  Walpole was only\r\ntwenty-four years of age when he took his seat in the House of Commons\r\nas member for Castle Rising in Norfolk.  He was a young country squire\r\nof considerable fortune, and a thorough supporter of the Whig party.\r\nWalpole came into Parliament at that happy time for men of his position\r\nwhen the change was already taking place which marked the\r\nrepresentative assembly as the controlling power in the State.  The\r\nGovernment as a direct ruling power was beginning to grow less and less\r\neffective, and the House of Commons beginning to grow more and more\r\nstrong.  This change had begun to set in during the Restoration, and by\r\nthe time Walpole came to be known in Parliament it was becoming more\r\nand more evident that the Ministers of State were in the future only to\r\nbe men intrusted with the duty of carrying out the will of the majority\r\nin the House of Commons.  Before that majority every other power in the\r\nState was ultimately to bend.  The man, therefore, {33} who could by\r\neloquence, genuine statesmanship, and force of character, or even by\r\nmere tact, secure the adhesion of that majority, had become virtually\r\nthe ruler of the State.  But as will easily be seen, his rule even then\r\nwas something very different indeed from the rule of an arbitrary\r\nminister.  He would have to satisfy, to convince, to conciliate the\r\nmajority.  A single false step, an hour's weakness of purpose, nay,\r\neven a failure for which he was not himself accountable in home or\r\nforeign policy, might deprive him of his influence over the majority,\r\nand might reduce him to comparative insignificance.  Therefore, the\r\ncontrolling power which a great minister acquired was held by virtue of\r\nthe most constant watchfulness, the most unsparing labor, energy, and\r\ndevotion, and also in a great measure by the favor of fortune and of\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nWalpole was a man eminently qualified to obtain influence over the\r\nHouse of Commons, and to keep it up when he had once obtained it.  No\r\nman could have promised less in the beginning.  That was an acute\r\nobserver who divined the genius of Cromwell under Cromwell's homely\r\nexterior when he first came up to Parliament.  Almost as much acuteness\r\nwould have been needed to enable any one to see the future\r\nPrime-minister of England and master of the House of Commons in the\r\nplain, unpromising form, the homely, almost stolid countenance, the\r\nungainly movements and gestures of Walpole.  Walpole was as much of a\r\nrustic as Lord Althorp in times nearer to our own acknowledged himself\r\nto be.  Althorp said he ought to have been a grazier, and that it was\r\nan odd chance which made him Prime-minister.  But the difference was\r\ngreat.  Walpole had the gifts which make a man prime-minister, despite\r\nhis country gentleman or grazier-like qualities.  It was not chance,\r\nbut Walpole himself which raised him to the position he came to hold.\r\nWalpole knew nothing and cared nothing about literature and art.  His\r\ngreat passion was for hunting; his next love was for wine, and his\r\nthird for his dinner.  Without any natural gift of eloquence he became\r\na great debater.  {34} Nature, which seemed to have lavished all her\r\nmost luxurious gifts on Bolingbroke, appeared to have pinched and\r\nstarved Walpole.  Where Bolingbroke was richest Walpole was poorest;\r\nBolingbroke's genius required a frequent rein; Walpole's intellect\r\nneeded the perpetual spur.  Yet Walpole, with his lack of imagination,\r\nof eloquence, of wit, of humor, and of culture, went farther and did\r\nmore than the brilliant Bolingbroke.  It was the old fable of the hare\r\nand the tortoise over again; perhaps it should rather be called a new\r\nversion of the old fable.  The farther the hare goes in the wrong way\r\nthe more she goes astray, and thus many of Bolingbroke's most rapid\r\nmovements only helped the tortoise to get to the goal before him.  In\r\n1708 Walpole, now recognized as an able debater, a clever tactician,\r\nand, above all things, an excellent man of business, was appointed\r\nSecretary at War.  He became at the same time leader of the House of\r\nCommons.  He was one of the managers in the unfortunate impeachment of\r\nthe empty-headed High-Church preacher, Dr. Sacheverell.  He resigned\r\noffice with the other Whig ministers in 1710.  Harley coming into power\r\noffered him a place in the new administration, which Walpole declined\r\nto accept.  The Tories, reckless and ruthless in their majority,\r\nexpelled Walpole from the House in 1712 and imprisoned him in the\r\nTower.  The charge against him was one of corruption, a charge easily\r\nmade in those days against any minister, and which, if high moral\r\nprinciples were to prevail, might probably have been as easily\r\nsustained as it was made.  Walpole, however, was not worse than his\r\ncontemporaries; nor, even if he had been, would the contemporaries have\r\nbeen inclined to treat his offences very seriously so long as they were\r\nnot inspired to act against him by partisan motives.  At the end of the\r\nsession he was released, and now, in the closing days of Anne's reign,\r\nall eyes turned to him as a rising man and a certain bulwark of the new\r\ndynasty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--The Dean of St. Patrick's]\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible not to regard Jonathan Swift as one of the\r\npoliticians, one of the statesmen, of this age.  {35} Swift was a\r\npolitician in the highest sense, although he had seen little of the one\r\ngreat political arena in which the battles of English parties were\r\nfought out.  He has left it on record that he never heard either\r\nBolingbroke or Harley speak in Parliament or anywhere in public.  He\r\nwas at this time about forty-seven years of age, and had not yet\r\nreached his highest point in politics or in literature.  The \"Tale of a\r\nTub\" had been written, but not \"Gulliver's Travels;\" the tract on \"The\r\nConduct of the Allies,\" but not the \"Drapier's Letters.\"  Even at this\r\ntime he was a power in political life; his was an influence with which\r\nstatesmen and even sovereigns had to reckon.  No pen ever served a\r\ncause better than his had served, and was yet to serve, the interests\r\nof the Tory party.  He was probably the greatest English pamphleteer at\r\na time when the pamphlet had to do all the work of the leading article\r\nand most of the work of the platform.  His churchmen's gown sat\r\nuneasily on him; he was like one of the fighting bishops of the Middle\r\nAges, with whom armor was the more congenial wear.  He had a fierce and\r\ndomineering temper, and indeed out of his strangely bright blue eyes\r\nthere was already beginning to shine only too ominously the wild light\r\nof that _saeva indignatio_ which the inscription drawn up by his own\r\nhand for his tomb described as lacerating his heart.  The ominous light\r\nat last broke out into the fire of insanity.  We shall meet Swift\r\nagain; just now we only stop to note him as a political influence.  At\r\nthis time he is Dean of St. Patrick's in Ireland; he has been lately in\r\nLondon trying, and without success, to bring about a reconciliation\r\nbetween Bolingbroke and Harley; and, finding his efforts ineffectual,\r\nand seeing that troubled times were near at hand, he has quietly\r\nwithdrawn to Berkshire.  Before leaving London he wrote the letter to\r\nLord Peterborough containing the remarkable words with which we have\r\nopened this volume.  It is curious that Swift himself afterwards\r\nascribed to Harley the saying about the Queen's health and the heedless\r\n{36} behavior of statesmen.  In his \"Enquiry into the Behaviour of the\r\nQueen's Last Ministry,\" dated June, 1715, he tells us that \"about\r\nChristmas, 1713,\" the Treasurer said to him \"whenever anything ails the\r\nQueen these people are out of their wits; and yet they are so\r\nthoughtless that as soon as she is well they act as if she were\r\nimmortal.\"  To which Swift adds the following significant comment: \"I\r\nhad sufficient reason, both before and since, to allow his observation\r\nto be true, and that some share of it might with justice be applied to\r\nhimself.\"  It was at the house of a clergyman at Upper Letcomb, near\r\nWantage, in Berkshire, that Swift stayed for some time before returning\r\nto his Irish home.  From Letcomb the reader will perhaps note with some\r\npainful interest that Swift wrote to Miss Esther Vanhomrigh, whom all\r\ngenerations will know as Vanessa, a letter, in which he describes his\r\nsomewhat melancholy mode of life just then, tells her \"this is the\r\nfirst syllable I have wrote to anybody since you saw me,\" and adds that\r\n\"if this place were ten times worse, nothing shall make me return to\r\ntown while things are in the situation I left them.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Addison]\r\n\r\nSwift, in his heart, trusted neither Bolingbroke nor Harley.  It seems\r\nclear that Lady Masham was under the impression that she had Swift as\r\nher accomplice in the intrigue which finally turned Harley out of\r\noffice.  She writes to him while he is at Letcomb a letter which could\r\nnot have been written if she were not in that full conviction; and he\r\ndoes not reply until the whole week's crisis is past and a new\r\ncondition of things arisen; and in the reply he commits himself to\r\nnothing.  If he distrusted Bolingbroke he could not help admiring him.\r\nBolingbroke was the only man then near the court whose genius must not\r\nhave been rebuked by Swift.  But Swift must, for all his lavish praises\r\nof Harley, have sometimes secretly despised the hesitating,\r\ntime-serving statesman, with whom indecision was a substitute for\r\nprudence, and to be puzzled was to seem to deliberate.  That Harley\r\nshould have had the playing of a great political game {37} while Swift\r\ncould only look on, is one of the anomalies of history which Swift's\r\nsardonic humor must have appreciated to the full.  Swift took his\r\nrevenge when he could by bullying his great official friends now and\r\nthen in the roughest fashion.  He knew that they feared him, and\r\nflattered him because they feared him, and he was glad of it, and\r\nhugged himself in the knowledge.  He knew even that at one time they\r\nwere uncertain of his fidelity, and took much pains by their praises\r\nand their promises to keep him close at their side; and this, too,\r\namused him.  He was amused as a tyrant might be at the obvious efforts\r\nof those around him to keep him in good-humor, or as a man conscious of\r\nincipient madness might find malign delight in the anxiety of his\r\nfriends to fall in with all his moods and not to cross him in anything\r\nhe was pleased to say.\r\n\r\nJoseph Addison had a political position and influence on the other side\r\nof the controversy which entitle him to be ranked among the statesmen\r\nof the day.  Only in the year before his tragedy of \"Cato\" had been\r\nbrought out, and it had created an altogether peculiar sensation.  Each\r\nof the two great political parties seized upon the opportunity given by\r\nGate's pompous political virtue, and claimed him as the spokesman of\r\ntheir cause.  The Whigs, of course, had the author's authority to\r\nappropriate the applause of Cato, and the Whigs had endeavored to pack\r\nthe House in order to secure their claim.  But the Tories were equal to\r\nthe occasion.  They appeared in great numbers, Bolingbroke, then\r\nSecretary of State, at their head.  When Cato lamented the extinguished\r\nfreedom of his country the Whigs were vociferous in their cheers, and\r\nglared fiercely at the Tories; but when the austere Roman was made to\r\ndenounce Caesar and a perpetual dictatorship, the Tories professed to\r\nregard this as a denunciation of Marlborough, and his demand to be made\r\ncommander-in-chief for life, and they gave back the cheering with\r\nredoubled vehemence.  At last Bolingbroke's own genius suggested a\r\nmaster-stroke.  He sent for the actor who played Cato's part, thanked\r\nhim in face of the {38} public, and presented him with a purse of gold\r\nbecause of the service he had done in sustaining the cause of liberty\r\nagainst the tyranny of a perpetual dictator.\r\n\r\nAddison held many high political offices.  He was Secretary to a Lord\r\nLieutenant of Ireland more than once; he was made Secretary to the\r\n\"Regents,\" as they were called--the commissioners intrusted by George\r\nthe First with the task of administration previous to his arrival in\r\nEngland.  He sat in Parliament; he was appointed Under-secretary of\r\nState, and was soon to be for a while one of the principal Secretaries\r\nof State.  The last number of his _Spectator_ was published at the\r\nclose of 1714.  This was indeed still a time when literary men might\r\nhold high political office.  The deadening influence of the Georges had\r\nnot yet quite prevailed against letters and art.  Matthew Prior, about\r\nwhose poetry the present age troubles itself but little, sat in\r\nParliament, was employed in many of the most important diplomatic\r\nnegotiations of the day, and had not long before this time held the\r\noffice of Plenipotentiary in Paris.  Richard Steele not merely sat in\r\nthe House of Commons, but was considered of sufficient importance to\r\ndeserve the distinction of a formal expulsion from the House because of\r\ncertain political diatribes for which he was held responsible and which\r\nthe Commons chose to vote libellous.  At the time we are now describing\r\nhe had re-entered Parliament, and was still a brilliant penman on the\r\nside of the Whigs.  His career as politician, literary man, and\r\npractical dramatist combined, seems in some sort a foreshadowing of\r\nthat of Richard Brinsley Sheridan.  Gay was appointed Secretary to Lord\r\nClarendon on a diplomatic mission to Hanover.  Nicholas Rowe, the\r\nauthor of the \"Fair Penitent\" and the translator of Lucan's\r\n\"Pharsalia,\" was at one time an Under-Secretary of State.  Rowe's\r\ndramatic work is not yet absolutely forgotten by the world.  We still\r\nhear of the \"gallant gay Lothario,\" although many of those who are glib\r\nwith the words do not know that they come from the \"Fair Penitent,\" and\r\nwould not care even if they did know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{39}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\"LOST FOR WANT OF SPIRIT.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--The Duke of Ormond]\r\n\r\nWhen Bolingbroke found himself in full power he began at once to open the\r\nway for some attempt at the restoration of the Stuart dynasty.  He put\r\ninfluential Jacobites into important offices in England and Scotland; he\r\nmade the Duke of Ormond Warden of the Cinque Ports, that authority\r\ncovering exactly the stretch of coast at some point of which it might be\r\nexpected that James Stuart would land if he were to make an attempt for\r\nthe crown at all.  Ormond was a weak and vain man, but he was a man of\r\npersonal integrity.  He had been sent out to Flanders to succeed the\r\ngreatest commander of the age as captain-general of the allied armies\r\nthere, and he had naturally played a poor and even ridiculous part.  The\r\nJacobites in England still, however, held him in much honor, identified\r\nhis name, no one exactly knew why, with the cause of High-Church, and\r\nelected him the hero and the leader of the movement for the restoration\r\nof the exiled family.  Bolingbroke committed Scotland to the care of the\r\nEarl of Mar, a Jacobite, a personal friend of James Stuart, and a votary\r\nof High-Church.  It can hardly be supposed that in making such an\r\nappointment Bolingbroke had not in his mind the possibility of a rising\r\nof the Highland clans against the Hanoverian succession.  But it is none\r\nthe less evident that Bolingbroke was as usual thinking far more of\r\nhimself than of his party, and that his preparations were made not so\r\nmuch with a view to restoring the Stuarts as with the object of securing\r\nhimself against any chance that might befall.\r\n\r\n{40}\r\n\r\nHad Bolingbroke been resolved in his heart to bring back the Stuarts, had\r\nhe been ready, as many other men were, to risk all in that cause, to\r\nstand or fall by it, he might, so far as one can see, have been\r\nsuccessful.  It is not too much to say that on the whole the majority of\r\nthe English people were in favor of the Stuarts.  Certainly the majority\r\nwould have preferred a Stuart to the dreaded and disliked German prince\r\nfrom Herrenhausen.  For many years the birthday of the Stuart prince had\r\nbeen celebrated as openly and as enthusiastically in English cities as if\r\nit were the birthday of the reigning sovereign.  James's adherents were\r\neverywhere--in the court, in the camp, on the bench, in Parliament, in\r\nthe drawing-rooms, the coffee-houses, and the streets.  Bolingbroke had\r\nonly to present him at a critical moment, and say \"Here is your king,\"\r\nand James Stuart would have been king.  Such a crisis came in France in\r\nour own days.  There was a moment, after the fall of the Second Empire,\r\nwhen the Count de Chambord had only to present himself in Versailles in\r\norder to be accepted as King of France, not King of the French.  But the\r\nCount de Chambord put away his chance deliberately; he would not consent\r\nto give up the white flag of legitimacy and accept the tricolor.  He\r\nacted on principle, knowing the forfeit of his decision.  The chances of\r\nJames Stuart were frittered away in half-heartedness, insincerity, and\r\nfolly.  While Bolingbroke and his confederates were caballing and\r\ncounselling, and paltering and drinking, the Whig statesmen were maturing\r\ntheir plans, and when the moment came for action it found them ready to\r\nact.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--The Council at Kensington]\r\n\r\nThe success was accomplished by a _coupe d'état_ on Friday, July 30,\r\n1714.  The Queen was suddenly stricken with apoplexy.  A Privy Council\r\nwas to meet that morning at Kensington Palace.  The Privy Council meeting\r\nwas composed then, according to the principle which prevails still, only\r\nof such councillors as had received a special summons.  In truth, the\r\nmeeting of the Privy Council {41} in Anne's time was like a Cabinet\r\nmeeting of our days, and was intended by those who convened it to be just\r\nas strictly composed of official members.  But, on the other hand, there\r\nwas no law or rule forbidding any member of the Privy Council, whether\r\nsummoned or not, to present himself at the meeting.  Bolingbroke was in\r\nhis place, and so was the Duke of Ormond, and so were other Jacobite\r\npeers.  The Duke of Shrewsbury had taken his seat, as he was entitled to\r\ndo, being one of the highest officers of State.  Shrewsbury was known to\r\nbe a loyal adherent of the Act of Settlement and the Hanoverian\r\nSuccession.  He was a remarkable man with a remarkable history.  His\r\nfather was the unfortunate Shrewsbury who was killed in a duel by the\r\nDuke of Buckingham.  The duel arose out of the duke's open intrigue with\r\nthe Countess of Shrewsbury, and the story went at the time that the lady\r\nherself, dressed as a page, held her lover's horse while he fought with\r\nand killed her husband.  Charles Talbot, the son, was brought up a\r\nCatholic, but in his twentieth year accepted the arguments of Tillotson\r\nand became a Protestant.  He was Lord Chamberlain to James the Second,\r\nbut lost all faith in James, and went over to Holland to assist William\r\nof Nassau with counsel and with money.  When William became King of\r\nEngland he made Lord Shrewsbury a Privy Councillor and Secretary of\r\nState, created him first marquis and afterwards duke, and called him, in\r\ntribute to his great popularity, the King of Hearts.  He was for a short\r\ntime British Ambassador at the Court of France, and then Lord Lieutenant\r\nof Ireland.  He had flickered a little between the Whigs and the Tories\r\nat different periods of his career, and in 1710 he actually joined the\r\nTory party.  But it was well known to every one that if any question\r\nshould arise between the House of Hanover and the Stuarts, he would stand\r\nfirmly by the appointed succession.  He was a man of undoubted integrity\r\nand great political sagacity; he had a handsome face, although he had\r\nlost one of his eyes by an accident when riding, and {42} he had a\r\nstately presence.  His gifts and graces were said to have so much\r\nattracted the admiration of Queen Mary that if she had outlived the King\r\nshe would probably have married Shrewsbury.  The condition of the\r\npolitical world around him had impressed him with so little reverence for\r\ncourts and cabinets, that he used to say if he had a son he would rather\r\nbring him up a cobbler than a courtier, and a hangman than a statesman.\r\nBolingbroke once kindly said of him, \"I never knew a man so formed to\r\nplease, and to gain upon the affections while challenging the esteem.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--The Dukes of Somerset and Argyll]\r\n\r\nBefore there was time to get to any of the business of the council the\r\ndoors were opened, and the Duke of Argyll and the Duke of Somerset\r\nentered the room.  The Duke of Argyll, soldier, statesman, orator, shrewd\r\nself-seeker, represented the Whigs of Scotland; the honest, proud,\r\npompous Duke of Somerset those of England.  The two intruders, as they\r\nwere assuredly regarded by the majority of those present, announced that\r\nthey had heard the news of the Queen's danger, and that they felt\r\nthemselves bound to hasten to the meeting of the council, although not\r\nsummoned thither, in order that they might be able to afford advice and\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Somerset was in many respects the most powerful nobleman in\r\nEngland.  But all his rank, his dignity, and his influence, could not\r\nprotect him against the ridicule and contempt which his feeble character,\r\nhis extravagant pride, and his grotesquely haughty demeanor, invariably\r\nbrought upon him.  He was probably the most ridiculous man of his time;\r\nhe had the pomp of an Eastern pasha without the grave dignity which\r\nEastern manners confer.  He was like the pasha of a burlesque or an\r\n_opéra bouffe_.  His servants had to obey him by signs; he disdained to\r\ngive orders by voice.  His first wife was Elizabeth Percy, the virgin\r\nwidow of Lord Ogle and Tom Thynne of Longleat, the beloved of Charles\r\nJohn Königsmark, the \"Carrots\" of Dean Swift.  While she was Duchess of\r\nSomerset and Queen Anne's close friend, Swift, who {43} hated her, hinted\r\npretty broadly that she was privy to Königsmark's plot to murder Tom\r\nThynne, and the Duchess revenged herself by keeping the Dean out of the\r\nbishopric of Hereford.  When she died, Somerset married Lady Charlotte\r\nFinch, one of the \"Black Funereal Finches,\" celebrated by Sir Charles\r\nHanbury Williams.  Once, when she tapped him on the shoulder with a fan,\r\nhe rebuked her angrily: \"My first wife was a Percy, and she never took\r\nsuch a liberty.\"  When he had occasion to travel, all the roads on or\r\nnear which he had to pass were scoured by a vanguard of outriders, whose\r\nbusiness it was to protect him, not merely from obstruction and delay,\r\nbut from the gaze of the vulgar herd who might be anxious to feast their\r\neyes upon his gracious person.  The statesmen of his own time, while they\r\nmade use of him, seem to have vied with each other in protestations of\r\ntheir contempt for his abilities and his character.  Swift declared that\r\nSomerset had not \"a grain of sense of any kind.\"  Marlborough several\r\ntimes professed an utter contempt for Somerset's abilities or discretion,\r\nand was indignant at the idea that he ever could have made use of such a\r\nman in any work requiring confidence or judgment.  Yet Somerset,\r\nridiculous as he was, came to be a personage of importance in the crisis\r\nnow impending over England.  He was, at all events, a man whose word\r\ncould be trusted, and who, when he promised to take a certain course,\r\nwould be sure to follow it.  That very pride which made him habitually\r\nridiculous raised him on great occasions above any suspicion of mercenary\r\nor personal views in politics.  One of his contemporaries describes him\r\nas \"so humorsome, proud, and capricious, that he was rather a ministry\r\nspoiler than a ministry maker.\"  In the present condition of things,\r\nhowever, he could be made use of for the purpose of making one ministry\r\nafter spoiling another.  When he carried his great personal influence\r\nover to the side of the Hanoverian accession, and joined with Argyll and\r\nwith Shrewsbury, it must have been evident, to men like Bolingbroke at\r\nleast, that the enterprises of the Jacobites {44} would require rare\r\ngood-fortune and marvellous energy to bring them to any success.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--The coup d'état]\r\n\r\nPoetry and romance have shown to the world the most favorable side of the\r\ncharacter of John Campbell, Duke of Argyll, who was then at least as\r\npowerful in Scotland as the Duke of Somerset in England.  Pope describes\r\nhim as\r\n\r\n  Argyll, the State's whole thunder born to wield,\r\n  And shake alike the senate and the field.\r\n\r\nScott has drawn a charming picture of him in the \"Heart of Mid-Lothian\"\r\nas the patriotic Scotchman, whose heart must \"be cold as death can make\r\nit when it does not warm to the tartan\"--the kind and generous protector\r\nof Jeanie Deans.  Argyll was a man of many gifts.  He was a soldier, a\r\nstatesman, and an orator.  He had charged at Ramilies and Oudenarde, had\r\nrallied a shrinking column at Malplaquet, and served in the sieges of\r\nOstend and Lille and Ghent.  His eloquence in the House of Lords is said\r\nto have combined the freshness of youth, the strength of manhood, and the\r\nwisdom of old age.  Lord Hervey, who is not given to praise, admits that\r\nArgyll was \"gallant, and a good officer, with very good parts, and much\r\nmore reading and knowledge than generally falls to the share of a man\r\neducated a soldier, and born to so great a title and fortune.\"  But\r\nHervey also says that Argyll was \"haughty, passionate, and peremptory,\"\r\nand it cannot be doubted that he was capable of almost any political\r\ntergiversation, or even treachery, which could have served his purpose;\r\nand his purpose was always his own personal interest.  He changed his\r\nopinions with the most unscrupulous promptitude; he gave an opinion one\r\nway and acted another way without hesitation, and without a blush.  He\r\nwas always equal to the emergency; he had the full courage of his\r\nnon-convictions.  He was the grandson of that Argyll whose last sleep\r\nbefore his execution is the subject of Mr. Ward's well-known painting;\r\nhis great-grandfather, too, gave up his life on the scaffold.  He did not\r\nwant any of the courage of his ancestors; but he was {45} likely to take\r\ncare that his advancement should not be to the block or the gallows.  At\r\nsuch a moment as this which we are now describing his adhesion and his\r\naction were of inestimable value to the Hanoverian cause.\r\n\r\nWhen these two great peers entered the council-chamber a moment of\r\nperplexity and confusion followed.  Bolingbroke and Ormond had probably\r\nnot even yet a full understanding of the meaning of this dramatic\r\nperformance, and what consequences it was likely to insure.  While they\r\nsat silent, according to some accounts, the Duke of Shrewsbury arose, and\r\ngravely thanking the Whig peers for their courtesy in attending the\r\ncouncil, accepted their co-operation in the name of all the others\r\npresent.  They took their places at the council-table, and St. John and\r\nOrmond must have begun to feel that all was over.  The intrusion of the\r\nWhig peers was a daring and a significant step in itself, but when the\r\nDuke of Shrewsbury welcomed their appearance and accepted their\r\nco-operation, it was clear to the Jacobites that all was part of a\r\nprearranged scheme, to which resistance would now be in vain.  The new\r\nvisitors to the council called for the reports of the royal physician,\r\nand having received and read them, suggested that the Duke of Shrewsbury\r\nshould be recommended to the Queen as Lord High Treasurer.  St. John did\r\nnot venture to resist the proposal; he could only sit with as much\r\nappearance of composure as he was enabled to maintain, and accept the\r\nsuggestion of his enemies.  A deputation of the peers, with the Duke of\r\nShrewsbury among them, at once sought and obtained an interview with the\r\ndying Queen.  She gave the Lord High Treasurer's staff into Shrewsbury's\r\nhand, and bade him, it is said, in that voice of singular sweetness and\r\nmelody which was almost her only charm, to use it for the good of her\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe office of Lord High Treasurer is now always put into what is called\r\ncommission; its functions are managed by several ministers, of whom the\r\nFirst Lord of the Treasury is one, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\n{46} another.  In all recent times the First Lord of the Treasury has\r\nusually been Prime-minister, and his office therefore corresponds fairly\r\nenough with that which was called the office of Lord High Treasurer in\r\nearlier days.  It was clear that when the Duke of Shrewsbury became Lord\r\nHigh Treasurer at such a junction he would stand firmly by the Protestant\r\nsuccession, and would oppose any kind of scheming in the cause of the\r\nexiled Stuarts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Whigs in possession]\r\n\r\nSome writers near to that time, and Mr. Lecky among more recent\r\nhistorians, are of opinion that it was not either of the intruding dukes\r\nwho proposed that Shrewsbury should be appointed Treasurer.  Mr. Lecky is\r\neven of opinion that it may have been Bolingbroke himself who made the\r\nsuggestion.  That seems to us extremely probable.  All accounts agree in\r\nconfirming the idea that Bolingbroke was taken utterly by surprise when\r\nthe great Whig dukes entered the council-chamber.  The moment he saw that\r\nShrewsbury welcomed them he probably made up his mind to the fact that an\r\nentirely new condition of things had arisen, and that all his previous\r\ncalculations were upset.  He was not a man to remain long dumfounded by\r\nany change in the state of affairs.  It would have been quite consistent\r\nwith his character and his general course of action if, when he saw the\r\nmeaning of the crisis, he had at once resolved to make the best of it and\r\nto try to keep himself still at the head of affairs.  In that spirit\r\nnothing is more likely than that he should have pushed himself to the\r\nfront once more, and proposed, as Lord High Treasurer, the man whom, but\r\nfor the sudden and overwhelming pressure brought to bear upon him, he\r\nwould have tried to keep out of all influence and power at such a moment.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of the Duke of Shrewsbury settled the question.  The\r\ncrisis was virtually over.  The Whig statesmen at once sent out summonses\r\nto all the members of the Privy Council living anywhere near London.\r\nThat same afternoon another meeting of the council was held.  Somers\r\nhimself, the great Whig leader whose {47} services had made the party\r\nillustrious in former reigns, and whose fame sheds a lustre on them even\r\nto this hour--Somers, aged, infirm, decaying as he was in body and in\r\nmind--hastened to attend the summons, and to lend his strength and his\r\nauthority to the measures on which his colleagues had determined.  The\r\ncouncil ordered the concentration of several regiments in and near\r\nLondon.  They recalled troops from Ostend, and sent a fleet to sea.\r\nGeneral Stanhope, a soldier and statesman of whom we shall hear more, was\r\nprepared, if necessary, to take possession of the Tower and clap the\r\nleading Jacobites into it, to obtain possession of all the outports, and,\r\nin short, to act as military dictator, authorized to anticipate\r\nrevolution and to keep the succession safe.  In a word, the fate of the\r\nStuarts was sealed.  Bolingbroke was checkmated; the Chevalier de St.\r\nGeorge would have put to sea in vain.  Marlborough was on his way to\r\nEngland, and there was nothing to do but to wait till the breath was out\r\nof Queen Anne's body, and proclaim George the Elector King of England.\r\n\r\nThe time of waiting was not long.  Anne sank into death on August 1,\r\n1714, and the heralds proclaimed that \"the high and mighty Prince George,\r\nElector of Brunswick and Luneburg, is, by the death of Queen Anne of\r\nblessed memory, become our lawful and rightful liege lord, King of Great\r\nBritain, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith.\"  This \"King of\r\nFrance\" was lucky enough not to come to his throne until the conclusion\r\nof a long war against the King of France who lived in Versailles.  The\r\n\"Defender of the Faith\" was just now making convenient arrangements that\r\nhis mistresses should follow him as speedily as possible when he should\r\nhave to take his unwilling way to his new dominions.\r\n\r\nOn August 3d Bolingbroke wrote a letter to Dean Swift, in which he says,\r\n\"The Earl of Oxford was removed on Tuesday; the Queen died on Sunday.\r\nWhat a world this is, and how does fortune banter us!\"  In other {48}\r\nwords, Bolingbroke tells Swift that full success seemed within his grasp\r\non Tuesday, and was suddenly torn away from him on Sunday.  But the most\r\ncharacteristic part of the letter is a passage which throws a very blaze\r\nof light over the unconquerable levity of the man.  \"I have lost all by\r\nthe death of the Queen but my spirit; and, I protest to you, I feel that\r\nincrease upon me.  The Whigs are a pack of Jacobites; that shall be the\r\ncry in a month, if you please.\"  No sooner is one web of intrigue swept\r\naway than Bolingbroke sets to work to weave a new one on a different\r\nplan.  Nothing can subdue those high animal spirits; nothing can physic\r\nthat selfishness; nothing can fix that levity to a recognition of the\r\nrealities of things.  Bolingbroke has not a word now about the cause of\r\nthe Stuarts; for the moment he cannot think of that.  His new scheme is\r\nto make out that his enemies were, after all, the true Jacobites; he will\r\ncheckmate them that way--\"in a month, if you please.\"  On the very same\r\nday Mr. John Barber, the printer of some of Swift's pamphlets, afterwards\r\nan Alderman and Lord Mayor, writes to Swift and tells him, speaking of\r\nBolingbroke, that \"when my lord gave me the letter\" (to be enclosed to\r\nSwift) \"he said he hoped you would come up and help to save the\r\nconstitution, which, with a little good management, might be kept in Tory\r\nhands.\"  The chill, clear common-sense of Swift's answer might have\r\nimpressed even Bolingbroke, but did not.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Simon Harcourt]\r\n\r\nOne among the Tories, indeed, would have had the courage to forestall the\r\nWhigs and their proclamation.  This one man was a priest, and not a\r\nsoldier.  Atterbury, the eloquent Bishop of Rochester, came to\r\nBolingbroke, and urged him to proclaim King James at Charing Cross,\r\noffering himself to head a procession in his lawn sleeves if Bolingbroke\r\nwould only act on his advice.  But for the moment Bolingbroke could only\r\ncomplain of fortune's banter, and plan out new intrigues for the\r\nrestoration, not of the Stuarts, but of the Tory party--that is to say,\r\nof {49} himself.  His refusal wrung from Atterbury the declaration that\r\nthe best cause in England was lost for want of spirit.\r\n\r\nParliament assembled, and on August 5th the Commons were summoned to the\r\nBar of the House of Lords, and the Lord Chancellor made a speech in the\r\nname of the Lords of the Regency.  He told the Lords and Commons that the\r\nPrivy Council appointed by George, Elector of Hanover, had proclaimed\r\nthat prince as the lawful and rightful sovereign of these realms.  Both\r\nHouses agreed to send addresses to the King, expressing their duty and\r\naffection, and the House of Commons passed a bill granting to his Majesty\r\nthe same civil list as that which Queen Anne had enjoyed, but with\r\nadditional clauses for the payment of arrears due to the Hanoverian\r\ntroops who had been in the service of Great Britain.  The Lord\r\nChancellor, who had just addressed the House of Lords and the Commoners\r\nstanding at the Bar, was himself a remarkable illustration of the\r\npolitics and the principles of that age.  Simon Harcourt had been Lord\r\nChancellor in the later years of Queen Anne's life.  His appointment\r\nended with her death, but he was re-appointed by the Lords of the Regency\r\nin the name of the new sovereign, and he was again sworn in as Lord\r\nChancellor on August 3, 1714, \"in Court at his house aforesaid, Lincoln's\r\nInn Fields, _Anno Primo, Georgii Regis_.\"  He was one of the Lords\r\nJustices by virtue of his office, and as such had already taken the oath\r\nof allegiance to the new sovereign, and of abjuration to James.  Lord\r\nHarcourt had been throughout his whole career not only a very devoted\r\nTory, but in later years a positive Jacobite.  He was a highly\r\naccomplished speaker, a man of great culture, and a lawyer of\r\nconsiderable, if not pre-eminent, attainments.  He was still\r\ncomparatively young for a public man of such position.  Born in 1660, he\r\nentered Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1675, was admitted to the Inner\r\nTemple in 1676, and called to the Bar in 1683.  He became member of\r\nParliament for Abingdon in 1690, and soon rose to great distinction in\r\nthe {50} House of Commons as well as at the Bar.  He conducted the\r\nimpeachment of the great Lord Somers, and was knighted and made\r\nSolicitor-General by Anne in 1702.  He became Attorney-General shortly\r\nafter.  He conducted, in 1703, the prosecution of Defoe for his famous\r\nsatirical tract, \"The Shortest Way with the Dissenters.\"  Harcourt threw\r\nhimself into the prosecution with the fervor and the bitterness of a\r\nsectary and a partisan.  He made a most vehement and envenomed speech\r\nagainst Defoe; he endeavored to stir up every religious prejudice and\r\npassion in favor of the prosecution.  Coke had scarcely shown more of the\r\nanimosity of a partisan in prosecuting Raleigh than Simon Harcourt did in\r\nprosecuting Defoe.  In 1709-10 Harcourt was the leading counsel for\r\nSacheverell, and received the Great Seal in 1710, becoming, as the phrase\r\nthen was, \"Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of Great Britain.\"  A whole\r\nyear, wanting only a few days, passed before he was raised to the peerage\r\nas Lord Harcourt.  He acted as Speaker of the House of Lords before he\r\nbecame a peer and a member of the House, and even had on one occasion to\r\nexpress on behalf of the Peers their thanks to Lord Peterborough for his\r\nservices in Spain.  In 1713 he became Lord Chancellor of England.  During\r\nall this time he had been a most devoted adherent of the Stuarts, and\r\nduring the later period he was an open and avowed Jacobite.  He had\r\nopposed strongly the oaths of abjuration which now, as Lord Chief\r\nJustice, he had both taken and administered.  Almost his first\r\nconspicuous act as a member of Parliament was to protest against the Bill\r\nwhich required the oath Of abjuration of James and his descendants, and\r\nhe maintained consistently the same principles and the same policy till\r\nthe death of Queen Anne.  There can be no doubt that if just then any\r\nmovement had been made on behalf of the Stuarts, with the slightest\r\nchance of success, Lord Chancellor Harcourt would have thrown himself\r\ninto it heart and soul.  Nevertheless, he took the oath of allegiance and\r\nthe oath of abjuration; he professed to be a loyal subject of the King,\r\n{51} whose person and principles he despised and detested, and he swore\r\nto abjure forever all adhesion to that dynasty which with all his heart\r\nhe would have striven, if he could, to restore to the throne of England.\r\nLord Campbell, in his \"Lives of the Lord Chancellors,\" says of Harcourt,\r\n\"I do not consider his efforts to restore the exiled Stuarts morally\r\ninconsistent with the engagements into which he had entered to the\r\nexisting Government; and although there were loud complaints against him\r\nfor at last sending in his adhesion to the House of Hanover, it should be\r\nrecollected that the cause of the Stuarts had then become desperate, and\r\nthat instead of betraying he did everything in his power to screen his\r\nold associates.\"  The cause of the Stuarts had not become, even then, so\r\nutterly desperate as to prevent many brave men from laying down their\r\nlives for it.  Thirty years had to pass away before the last blow was\r\nstruck for that cause of the Stuarts which Harcourt by solemn oath\r\nabjured forever.  Such credit as he is entitled to have, because he\r\nprotected rather than betrayed his old associates, we are free to give\r\nhim, and it stands a significant illustration of the political morality\r\nof the time that such comparative credit is all that his enthusiastic\r\nbiographer ventures to claim for him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Lords and Commons]\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords had then two hundred and seven members, many of whom,\r\nbeing Catholics, were not permitted to take any part in public business.\r\nThat number of Peers is about in just proportion to the population of\r\nEngland as it was then when compared with the Peers and the population of\r\nEngland at present.  In the House of Commons there were at the same time\r\nfive hundred and fifty-eight members.  England sent in five hundred and\r\nthirteen, and Scotland, which had lately accepted the union, returned\r\nforty-five.  It need hardly be said that at that time Ireland had her own\r\nParliament, and sent no members to Westminster.  A great number of the\r\ncounty family names in the House of Commons were just the same as those\r\nwhich we see at present.  The Stanhopes, the Lowthers, the Lawsons, the\r\nHerberts, the Harcourts, {52} the Cowpers, the Fitzwilliams, the Cecils,\r\nthe Grevilles; all these, and many others, were represented in Parliament\r\nthen as they are represented in Parliament now.  Then, as more lately,\r\nthe small boroughs had the credit of returning, mostly of course through\r\nfamily influence, men of eminence other than political, who happened to\r\nsit in the House of Commons.  Steele sat for Stockbridge, in \"Southampton\r\nCounty,\" as Hampshire was then always called, Addison for Malmesbury,\r\nPrior for East Grinstead.  There were no reports of the debates, nor\r\nprinted lists of the divisions.  Questions of foreign policy were\r\nsometimes discussed with doors strictly closed against all strangers,\r\njust as similar questions are occasionally, and not infrequently,\r\ndiscussed in the Senate of the United States at present.  The pamphlet\r\nsupplied in some measure the place of the newspaper report and the\r\nnewspaper leading article.  Some twelve years later than this the\r\nbrilliant pen of Bolingbroke, who, if he had lived at a period nearer to\r\nour own, might have been an unrivalled writer of leading articles, was\r\nable to obtain for the series of pamphlets called \"The Craftsman\" a\r\ncirculation greater than that ever enjoyed by the _Spectator_.  Pulteney\r\nco-operated with him for a time in the work.  Steele, as we have said,\r\nhad been expelled from the House of Commons for his pamphlet \"The\r\nCrisis.\"  The caricature which played so important a part in political\r\ncontroversy all through the reigns of the Georges had just come into\r\nrecognized existence.  Countless caricatures of Bolingbroke, of Walpole,\r\nof Shrewsbury, of Marlborough, began to fly about London.  Scurrilous\r\nballads were of course in great demand, nor was the supply inadequate to\r\nthe demand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Malbrouck de Retour]\r\n\r\nOne of the most successful of these compositions described the return of\r\nthe Duke of Marlborough to London.  On the very day of the Queen's death\r\nMarlborough landed at Dover.  He came quickly on to London, and there,\r\naccording to the descriptions given by his admirers, he was received like\r\na restored sovereign returning to his throne.  A procession of two\r\nhundred gentlemen on {53} horseback met him on the road to London, and\r\nthe procession was joined shortly after by a long train of carriages.  As\r\nhe entered London the enthusiasm deepened with every foot of the way; the\r\nstreets were lined with crowds of applauding admirers.  Marlborough's\r\ncarriage broke down near Temple Bar, and he had to exchange it for\r\nanother.  The little incident was only a new cause for demonstrations of\r\nenthusiasm.  It was a fresh delight to see the hero more nearly than he\r\ncould be seen through his carriage-windows.  It was something to have\r\ndelayed him for a moment, and to have compelled him to stand among the\r\ncrowd of those who were pressing round to express their homage.  This was\r\nthe Whig description.  According to Tory accounts Marlborough was more\r\nhissed than huzzaed, and at Temple Bar the hissing was loudest.  The work\r\nof the historian would be comparatively easy if eye-witnesses could only\r\nagree as to any, even the most important, facts.\r\n\r\nEnthusiastic Whig pamphleteers called upon their countrymen to love and\r\nhonor their invincible hero, and declared that the wretch would be\r\nesteemed a disgrace to humanity, and should be transmitted to posterity\r\nwith infamy, who would dare to use his tongue or pen against him.  Such\r\nwretches, however, were found, and did not seem in the least to dread the\r\ninfamy which was promised them.  The scurrilous ballad of which we have\r\nalready spoken was by one Ned Ward, a publican and rhymester, and it\r\npictured the entry of the duke in verses after the fashion of Hudibras.\r\nIt depicted the procession as made up of\r\n\r\n  Frightful troops of thin-jawed zealots,\r\n  Curs'd enemies to kings and prelates;\r\n\r\nand declared that those \"champions of religious errors\" made London seem\r\n\r\n      As if the prince of terrors\r\n  Was coming with his dismal train\r\n  To plague the city once again.\r\n\r\nThe memory of what the Plague had done in London was still green enough\r\nto give bitter force to this allusion.\r\n\r\n{54}\r\n\r\nMarlborough could have afforded to despise what Hotspur calls the\r\n\"metre-ballad-mongers,\" but his pride received a check and chill not\r\neasily to be got over.  When fairly rid of his enthusiastic followers and\r\nadmirers he went to the House of Lords almost at once, and took the\r\noaths; but he did not remain there.  In truth, he soon found himself\r\nbitterly disappointed; not with the people--they could not have been more\r\nenthusiastic than they were--but with the new ruling power.  Immediately\r\nafter the death of the Queen, and even before the proclamation of the new\r\nsovereign had taken place, the Hanoverian resident in London handed to\r\nthe Privy Council a letter from George, in George's own handwriting,\r\nnaming the men who were to act in combination with the seven great\r\nofficers of State as lords justices.  The power to make this nomination\r\nwas provided for George by the Regency Act.  This document contained the\r\nnames of eighteen of the principal Whig peers; the Duke of Shrewsbury,\r\nthe Duke of Somerset, and the Duke of Argyll were among them; so, too,\r\nwere Lords Cowper, Halifax, and Townshend.  It was noted with wonder that\r\nthe illustrious name of Somers did not appear on the list, nor did that\r\nof Marlborough, nor that of Marlborough's son-in-law, Lord Sunderland.\r\nIt is likely that the omission of these names was only made in the first\r\ninstance because George and his advisers were somewhat afraid of his\r\ngetting into the hands of a sort of dictatorship--a dictatorship in\r\ncommission, as it might be called, made up of three or four influential\r\nmen.  The King afterwards hastened to show every attention to Marlborough\r\nand Somers and Sunderland, and he soon restored Marlborough to all his\r\npublic offices.  But George seems to have had a profound and a very\r\nwell-justified distrust of Marlborough.  Though he honored him with marks\r\nof respect and attention, though he restored him to the great position he\r\nhad held in the State, yet the King never allowed Marlborough to suppose\r\nthat he really had regained his former influence in court and political\r\nlife.  Marlborough was shelved, and he already knew it, and bitterly\r\ncomplained of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{55}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE KING COMES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Hanover]\r\n\r\n\"The old town of Hanover,\" says Thackeray, \"must look still pretty much\r\nas in the time when George Louis left it.  The gardens and pavilions of\r\nHerrenhausen are scarce changed since the day when the stout old\r\nElectress Sophia fell down in her last walk there, preceding but by a\r\nfew weeks to the tomb James the Second's daughter, whose death made way\r\nfor the Brunswick Stuarts in England. . . .  You may see at\r\nHerrenhausen the very rustic theatre in which the Platens danced and\r\nperformed masks and sang before the Elector and his sons.  There are\r\nthe very fauns and dryads of stone still glimmering through the\r\nbrandies, still grinning and piping their ditties of no tone, as in the\r\ndays when painted nymphs hung garlands round them, appeared under their\r\nleafy arcades with gilt crooks, guiding rams with gilt horns, descended\r\nfrom 'machines' in the guise of Diana or Minerva, and delivered immense\r\nallegorical compliments to the princes returned home from the\r\ncampaign.\"  Herrenhausen, indeed, is changed but little since those\r\ndays of which Thackeray speaks.  But although not many years have\r\npassed since Thackeray went to visit Hanover before delivering his\r\nlectures on \"The Four Georges,\" Hanover itself has undergone much\r\nalteration.  If one of the Georges could now return to his ancestral\r\ncapital he would indeed be bewildered at the great new squares, the\r\nrows of tall vast shops and warehouses, the spacious railway-station,\r\npenetrated to every corner at night by the keen electric light.  But in\r\npassing from Hanover to Herrenhausen one goes back, in a short drive,\r\nfrom the {56} days of the Emperor William of Germany to the days of\r\nGeorge the Elector.  Herrenhausen, the favorite residence of the\r\nElectors of Hanover, is but a short distance from the capital.\r\nThackeray speaks of it as an ugly place, and it certainly has not many\r\nclaims to the picturesque.  But it is full of a certain curious\r\nhalf-melancholy interest, and well fitted to be the cradle and the home\r\nof a decaying Hanoverian dynasty.  In its galleries one may spend many\r\nan hour, not unprofitably, in studying the faces of all the men and\r\nwomen who are famous, notorious, or infamous in connection with the\r\nhistory of Hanover.  The story of that dynasty has more than one\r\nepisode not unlike that of the unfortunate Sophia Dorothea and\r\nKönigsmark, her lover.  A good many grim legends haunt the place and\r\ngive interest to some of the faces, otherwise insipid enough, which\r\nlook out of the heavy frames and the formal court-dresses of the\r\npicture-gallery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--The entry into London]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of August 5, 1714, four days after Queen Anne's death,\r\nLord Clarendon, the lately appointed English Minister at the Court of\r\nHanover, set out for the palace of Herrenhausen to bear to the new King\r\nof Great Britain the tidings of Queen Anne's death.  About two o'clock\r\nin the morning he entered the royal apartments of the ungenial and\r\nsleepy George, and, kneeling, did homage to him as King of Great\r\nBritain.  George took the announcement of his new rank without even a\r\nsemblance of gratification.  He had made up his mind to endure it, and\r\nthat was all.  He was too stolid, or lazy, or sincere to affect the\r\nslightest personal interest in the news.  He lingered in Hanover as\r\nlong as he decently could, and sauntered for many a day through the\r\nprim, dull, and orderly walks of Herrenhausen.  He behaved very much in\r\nthe fashion of the convict in Prior's poem, who, when the cart was\r\nready and the halter adjusted,\r\n\r\n  Often took leave but seemed loath to depart.\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 31st had arrived before George began his journey to England.\r\nBut he did one or two good-natured things {57} before leaving Hanover;\r\nhe ordered the abolition of certain duties on provisions, and he had\r\nthe insolvent debtors throughout the Electorate discharged from\r\ncustody.  On September 5th he reached the Hague, and here another\r\nstoppage took place.  The exertion of travelling from Hanover to the\r\nHague had been so great that George apparently required a respite from\r\nSeptember 5th until the 16th.  On the 16th he embarked, and reached\r\nGreenwich two days after.  He was accompanied to England by his two\r\nleading favorites--the ladies whose charms we have already described.\r\nFor many days after his arrival in London the King did little but\r\nlament his exile from his beloved Herrenhausen, and tell every one he\r\nmet how cordially he disliked England, its people, and its ways.\r\nFortunately, perhaps, in this respect, for the popularity of his\r\nMajesty, George's audience was necessarily limited.  He spoke no\r\nEnglish, and hardly any of those who surrounded him could speak German,\r\nwhile some of his ministers did not even speak French.  Sir Robert\r\nWalpole tried to get on with him by talking Latin.  Even the English\r\noysters George could not abide; he grumbled long at their queer taste,\r\ntheir want of flavor, and it was some time before his devoted\r\nattendants discovered that their monarch liked stale oysters with a\r\ngood strong rankness about them.  No time was lost, when this important\r\ndiscovery had been made, in procuring oysters to the taste of the King,\r\nand one of George's objections to the throne of England was easily\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nThere was naturally great curiosity to see the King, and a writer of\r\nthe time gives an amusing account of the efforts made to obtain a sight\r\nof him.  \"A certain person has paid several guineas for the benefit of\r\nCheapside conduit, and another has almost given twenty years' purchase\r\nfor a shed in Stocks Market.  Some lay out great sums in shop-windows,\r\nothers sell lottery tickets to hire cobblers' stalls, and here and\r\nthere a vintner has received earnest for the use of his sign-post.\r\nKing Charles the Second's horse at the aforesaid market is to carry\r\ndouble, {58} and his Majesty at Charing Cross is to ride between two\r\ndraymen.  Some have made interest to climb chimneys, and others to be\r\nexalted to the airy station of a steeple.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--\"Under which King?\"]\r\n\r\nThe princely pageant which people were so eager to see lives still in a\r\nprint issued by \"Tim. Jordan and Tho. Bakenwell at Ye Golden Lion in\r\nFleet Street.\"  We are thus gladdened by a sight of the splendid\r\nprocession winding its way through St. James's Park to St. James's\r\nPalace.  There are musketeers and trumpeters on horseback; there are\r\ncourtly gentlemen on horse and afoot, and great lumbering, gilded,\r\ngaudily-bedizened carriages with four and six steeds, and more\r\ntrumpeters, on foot this time, and pursuivants and heralds--George was\r\nfond of heralds, and created two of his own, Hanover and\r\nGloucester--and then the royal carriage, with its eight prancing\r\nhorses, and the Elector of Hanover and King of England inside, with his\r\nhand to his heart, and still more soldiers following, both horse and\r\nfoot, and, of course, a loyal populace everywhere waving their\r\nthree-cornered hats and huzzaing with all their might.\r\n\r\nThe day of the entry was not without its element of tragedy.  In the\r\ncrowd Colonel Chudleigh called Mr. Charles Aldworth, M.P. for New\r\nWindsor, a Jacobite.  There was a quarrel, the gentlemen went to\r\nMarylebone Fields, exchanged a few passes, and Mr. Aldworth was almost\r\nimmediately killed.  This was no great wonder, for we learn, in a\r\nletter from Lord Berkeley of Stratton, preserved in the Wentworth\r\nPapers, describing the duel, that Mr. Aldworth had such a weakness in\r\nhis arms from childhood that he could not stretch them out; a fact,\r\nLord Berkeley hints, by no means unknown to his adversary.\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole has left a description of King George which is worth\r\ncitation.  \"The person of the King,\" he says, \"is as perfect in my\r\nmemory as if I saw him yesterday; it was that of an elderly man, rather\r\npale, and exactly like his pictures and coins; not tall, of an aspect\r\nrather good than august, with a dark tie-wig, a plain coat, waistcoat\r\nand breeches of snuff-colored cloth, with stockings of the {59} same\r\ncolor, and a blue ribbon over all.\"  George was fond of heavy dining\r\nand heavy drinking.  He often dined at Sir Robert Walpole's, at\r\nRichmond Hill, where he used to drink so much punch that even the\r\nDuchess of Kendal endeavored to restrain him, and received in return\r\nsome coarse admonition in German.  He was shy and reserved in general,\r\nand he detested all the troublesome display of royalty.  He hated going\r\nto the theatre in state, and he did not even care to show himself in\r\nfront of the royal box; he preferred to sit in another and less\r\nconspicuous box with the Duchess of Kendal and Lady Walsingham.  On the\r\nwhole, it would seem as if the inclination of the English people for\r\nthe Hanoverian dynasty was about to be tried by the severest test that\r\nfate could well ordain.  A dull, stolid, and profligate king, fond of\r\ndrink and of low conversation, without dignity of appearance or manner,\r\nwithout sympathy of any kind with the English people and English ways,\r\nand without the slightest knowledge of the English language, was\r\nsuddenly thrust upon the people and proclaimed their king.  Fortunately\r\nfor the Hanoverian dynasty, the English people, as a whole, had grown\r\ninto a mood of comparative indifference as to who should rule them so\r\nlong as they were let alone.  It was impossible that a strong feeling\r\nof loyalty to any House should burn just then in the breast of the\r\ngreat majority of the English people.  Those who were devoted to the\r\nStuarts and those who detested the Stuarts felt strongly on the subject\r\nthis way or that, and they would therefore admire or detest King George\r\naccording to their previously acquired political principles.  But to\r\nthe ordinary Englishman it only seemed that England had lately been\r\ntrying a variety of political systems and a variety of rulers; that one\r\nseemed to succeed hardly better than the other; that so long as no\r\ngreat breakdown in the system took place, it mattered little whether a\r\nStuart or a Brunswick was in temporary possession of the throne.\r\nWithin a comparatively short space of time the English Parliament had\r\ndeposed Charles the First; the Protectorate had been {60} tried under\r\nCromwell; the Restoration had been brought about by the adroitness of\r\nMonk; James the Second, a Catholic, had come to the throne, and had\r\nbeen driven off the throne by William the Third; William had\r\nestablished a new dynasty and a new system, which was no sooner\r\nestablished than it had to be succeeded by the introduction to the\r\nthrone of one of the daughters of the displaced House of Stuart.\r\nEngland had not had time to become attached, or even reconciled, to any\r\nof these succeeding rulers, and the English people in general--the\r\nEnglish people outside the circle of courts and Parliament and\r\npolitics--were well satisfied when George came to the throne to let any\r\none wear the crown who did not make himself and his system absolutely\r\nintolerable to the nation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--\"A King and no King.\"]\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned romantic principle of personal loyalty, unconditional\r\nloyalty--the loyalty of Divine right--was already languishing unto\r\ndeath.  It was now seen for the last time in effective contrast with\r\nwhat we may call the modern principle of loyalty.  The modern principle\r\nof loyalty to a sovereign is that which, having decided in favor of\r\nmonarchical government and of an hereditary succession, resolves to\r\nabide by that choice, and for the sake of the principle and of the\r\ncountry to pay all respect and homage to the person of the chosen\r\nruler.  But the loyalty which still clung to the fading fortunes of the\r\nStuarts was very different from this, and came into direct contrast\r\nwith the feelings shown by the majority of the people of England\r\ntowards the House of Hanover.  Though faults and weaknesses beyond\r\nnumber, weaknesses which were even worse than actual faults, tainted\r\nthe character and corroded the moral fibre of every successive Stuart\r\nprince, the devotees of personal loyalty still clung with sentiment and\r\nwith passion to the surviving representatives of the fallen dynasty.\r\nPoets and balladists, singers in the streets and singers on the\r\nmountain-side, were, even in these early days of George the First,\r\ninspired with songs of loyal homage in favor of the son of James the\r\nSecond.  Men {61} and women in thousands, not only among the wild\r\nromantic hills of Scotland, but in prosaic North of England towns, and\r\nyet more prosaic London streets and alleys, were ready, if the occasion\r\noffered, to die for the Stuart cause.  Despite the evidence of their\r\nown senses, men and women would still endow any representative of the\r\nStuarts with all the virtues and talents and graces that might become\r\nan ideal prince of romance.  No one thought in this way of the\r\nsuccessors of William the Third.  No one had had any particular\r\nadmiration for Queen Anne, either as a sovereign or as a woman; nobody\r\npretended to feel any thrill of sentimental emotion towards portly,\r\nstolid, sensual George the First.  About the King, personally, hardly\r\nanybody cared anything.  The mass of the English people who accepted\r\nhim and adhered to him did so because they understood that he\r\nrepresented a certain quiet homely principle in politics which would\r\nsecure tranquillity and stability to the country.  They did not ask of\r\nhim that he should be noble or gifted or dignified, or even virtuous.\r\nThey asked of him two things in especial: first, that he would maintain\r\na steady system of government; and next, that he would in general let\r\nthe country alone.  This is the feeling which must be taken into\r\naccount if we would understand how it came to pass that the English\r\npeople so contentedly accepted a sovereign like George the First.  The\r\nexplanation is not to be found merely in the fact that the Stuarts, as\r\na race, had discredited themselves hopelessly with the moral sentiment\r\nof the people of England.  The very worst of the Stuarts, Charles the\r\nSecond, was not any worse as regards moral character than George the\r\nFirst, or than some of the Georges who followed him.  In education and\r\nin mental capacity he was far superior to any of the Georges.  There\r\nwere many qualities in Charles the Second which, if his fatal love of\r\nease and of amusement could have been kept under control, might have\r\nmade him a successful sovereign, and which, were he in private life,\r\nwould undoubtedly have made him an {62} eminent man.  But the truth is\r\nthat the old feeling of blind unconditional homage to the sovereign was\r\ndying out; it was dying of inanition and old age and natural decay.\r\nOther and stronger forces in political thought were coming up to jostle\r\nit aside, even before its death-hour, and to occupy its place.  A king\r\nwas to be in England, for the future, a respected and honored chief\r\nmagistrate appointed for life and to hereditary office.  This new\r\ncondition of things influenced the feelings and conduct of hundreds of\r\nthousands of persons who were not themselves conscious of the change.\r\nThis was one great reason why George the First was so easily accepted\r\nby the country.  The king was in future to be a business king, and not\r\na king of sentiment and romance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{63}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nWHAT THE KING CAME TO.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Estimate of population]\r\n\r\nThe population of these islands at the close of the reign of Queen Anne\r\nwas probably not more than one-fifth of its present amount.  It is not\r\neasy to arrive at a precise knowledge with regard to the number of the\r\ninhabitants of England at that time, because there was no census taken\r\nuntil 1801.  We have, therefore, to be content with calculations\r\nfounded on the number of houses that paid certain taxes, and on the\r\nregister of deaths.  This is of course not a very exact way of getting\r\nat the result, but it enables us to form a tolerably fair general\r\nestimate.  According to these calculations, then, the population of\r\nEngland and Wales together was something like five millions and a half;\r\nthe population of Ireland at the same time appears to have been about\r\ntwo millions; that of Scotland little more than one.  But the\r\ndistribution of the population of these countries was very different\r\nthen from that of the present day.  Now the great cities and towns form\r\nthe numerical strength of England and Scotland at least, but at that\r\ntime the agricultural districts had a much larger proportion of the\r\npopulation than the towns could boast of.  London was then considered a\r\nvast and enormous city, but it was only a hamlet when compared with the\r\nLondon which we know.  Even then it absorbed more than one-tenth of the\r\nwhole population of England and Wales.  At the beginning of the reign\r\nof King George the First, London had a population of about seven\r\nhundred thousand, and it is a fact worthy of notice, that rapidly as\r\nthe {64} population of England has grown between that time and this,\r\nthe growth of the metropolis has been even greater in proportion.  The\r\nCity and Westminster were, at the beginning of George's reign, and for\r\nlong after, two distinct and separate towns; between them still lay\r\nmany wide spaces on which men were only beginning to build houses.\r\nFashion was already moving westward in the metropolis, obeying that\r\ncurious impulse which seems to prevail in all modern cities, and which\r\nmakes the West End as eagerly sought after in Paris, in Edinburgh, and\r\nin New York, as in London.  The life of London centred in St. Paul's\r\nand the Exchange; that of Westminster in the Court and the Houses of\r\nParliament.  All around the old Houses of Parliament were lanes,\r\nsquares, streets, and gate-ways covering the wide spaces and broad\r\nthoroughfares with which we are familiar.  Between Parliament Buildings\r\nand the two churches of St. Peter and St. Margaret ran a narrow,\r\ndensely crowded street, known as St. Margaret's Lane.  The spot where\r\nParliament Street now opens into Bridge Street was part of an\r\nuninterrupted row of houses running down to the water-gate by the\r\nriver.  The market-house of the old Woollen Market stood just where\r\nWestminster Bridge begins.  The Parliament Houses themselves are as\r\nmuch changed as their surroundings.  St. Stephen's Gallery now occupies\r\nthe site of St. Stephen's Chapel, where the Commons used to sit.\r\nWestminster Hall had rows of little shops or booths ranged all along\r\neach wall inside; they had been there for generations, and they\r\ncertainly did not add either to the beauty or the safety of the ancient\r\nhall.  In the early part of the seventeenth century some of them took\r\nfire and came near to laying in ashes one of the oldest occupied\r\nbuildings in the world.  Luckily, however, the fire was put out with\r\nslight damage, but the dangerous little shops were suffered to remain\r\nthen and for long after.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Old London]\r\n\r\nThe Lesser London of that day lives for us in contemporary engravings,\r\nin the pages of the _Spectator_ and the {65} _Tatler_, in the poems of\r\nSwift and Pope, in the pictures of Hogarth.  Hogarth's men and women\r\nbelong indeed to a later generation than the generation which\r\nBolingbroke dazzled, and Marlborough deceived, and Arbuthnot satirized,\r\nand Steele made merry over.  But it is only the men and women who are\r\ndifferent; the background remains the same.  New actors have taken the\r\nparts; the costumes are somewhat altered, but the scenes are scarcely\r\nchanged.  There may be a steeple more or a sign-board less in the\r\nstreets that Hogarth drew than there were when Addison walked them, but\r\npractically they are the same, and remained the same for a still later\r\ngeneration.  Maps of the time show us how curiously small London was.\r\nThere is open country to the north, just beyond Bloomsbury Square;\r\nSadler's Wells is out in the country, so is St. Pancras, so is\r\nTottenham Court, so is Marylebone.  At the east Stepney lies far away,\r\na distant hamlet.  Beyond Hanover Square to the west stretch fields\r\nagain, where Tyburn Road became the road to Oxford.  There is very\r\nlittle of London south of the river.\r\n\r\nThe best part of the political and social life of this small London was\r\npractically lived in the still smaller area of St. James's, a term\r\nwhich generally includes rather more than is contained within the\r\nstrict limits of St. James's parish.  If some Jacobite gentleman or\r\nloyal Hanoverian courtier of the year 1714 could revisit to-day the\r\nscenes in which he schemed and quarrelled, he would find himself among\r\nthe familiar names of strangely unfamiliar places.  St. James's Park\r\nindeed has not altered out of all recognition since the days when Duke\r\nBelair and my Lady Betty and my Lady Rattle walked the Mall between the\r\nhours of twelve and two, and quoted from Congreve about laughing at the\r\ngreat world and the small.  There were avenues of trees then as now.\r\nInstead of the ornamental water ran a long canal, populous with ducks,\r\nwhich joined a pond called--no one knows why--Rosamund's Pond.  This\r\npond was a favorite trysting-place for happy lovers--\"the sylvan\r\ndeities and rural {66} powers of the place, sacred and inviolable to\r\nlove, often heard lovers' vows repeated by its streams and echoes\"--and\r\na convenient water for unhappy lovers to drown themselves in, if we may\r\ncredit the _Tatler_.  St. James's Palace and Marlborough House on its\r\nright are scarcely changed; but to the left only Lord Godolphin's house\r\nlay between it and the pleasant park where the deer wandered.  Farther\r\noff, where Buckingham Palace now is, was Buckingham House.  It was then\r\na stately country mansion on the road to Chelsea, with semicircular\r\nwings and a sweep of iron railings enclosing a spacious court, where a\r\nfountain played round a Triton driving his sea-horses.  On the roof\r\nstood statues of Mercury, Liberty, Secrecy, and Equity, and across the\r\nfront ran an inscription in great gold letters, \"_Sic Siti Laetantur\r\nLares_.\" The household gods might well delight in so fair a spot and in\r\nthe music of that \"little wilderness full of blackbirds and\r\nnightingales,\" which the bowl-playing Duke who built the house lovingly\r\ndescribes to his friend Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Old London]\r\n\r\nMost of the streets in the St. James's region bear the names they bore\r\nwhen King George first came to London.  But it is only in name that\r\nthey are unchanged.  The street of streets, St. James's Street, is\r\nmetamorphosed indeed since the days when grotesque signs swung\r\noverhead, and great gilt carriages lumbered up and down from the park,\r\nand the chairs of modish ladies crowded up the narrow thoroughfares.\r\nSplendid warriors, fresh from Flanders or the Rhine, clinked their\r\ncourtly swords against the posts; red-coated country gentlemen jostled\r\ntheir wondering way through the crowd; and the Whig and Tory beaux,\r\nwith ruffles and rapiers, powder and perfume, haunted the coffee-houses\r\nof their factions.  Not a house of the old street remains as it was\r\nthen; not one of the panelled rooms in which minuets were danced by\r\ncandle-light to the jingle of harpsichord and tinkle of spinet, where\r\nwits planned pamphlets and pointed epigrams, where statesmen schemed\r\nthe overthrow of {67} ministries and even of dynasties, where flushed\r\nyouth punted away its fortunes or drank away its senses, and staggered\r\nout, perhaps, through the little crowd of chairmen and link-boys\r\nclustered at the door, to extinguish its foolish flame in a duel at\r\nLeicester Fields.  All that world is gone; only the name of the street\r\nremains, as full in its way of memories and associations as the S. P.\r\nQ. R. at the head of a municipal proclamation in modern Rome.\r\n\r\nThe streets off St. James's Street, too, retain their ancient names,\r\nand nothing more--King Street, Ryder Street, York Street, Jermyn\r\nStreet, the spelling of which seems to have puzzled last century\r\nwriters greatly, for they wrote it \"Jermyn,\" \"Germain,\" \"Germaine,\" and\r\neven \"Germin.\"  St. James's Church, Wren's handiwork, is all that\r\nremains from the age of Anne, with \"the steeple,\" says Strype, fondly,\r\n\"lately finished with a fine spire, which adds much splendor to this\r\nend of the town, and also serves as a landmark.\"  Perhaps it sometimes\r\nserved as a landmark to Richard Steele, reeling happily to the home in\r\n\"Berry\" Street, where his beloved Prue awaited him.  St. James's Square\r\nhas gone through many metamorphoses since it was first built in 1665,\r\nand called the Piazza.  In 1714 there was a rectangular enclosure in\r\nthe centre, with four passages at the sides, through which the public\r\ncould come and go as they pleased.  In a later generation the\r\ninhabitants railed the enclosure round, and set in the middle an oval\r\nbasin of water, large enough to have a boat upon it.  In old engravings\r\nwe see people gravely punting about on the quaint little pond.  The\r\nfulness of time filled in the pond, and set up King William the Third\r\ninstead in the middle of a grassy circle.  It would take too long to\r\nenumerate all the changes that our Georgian gentleman would find in the\r\nLondon of his day.  Some few, however, are especially worth recording.\r\nHe would seek in vain for the \"Pikadilly\" he knew, with its stately\r\nhouses and fair gardens.  It was almost a country road to the left of\r\nSt. James's Street, between the Green Park and Hyde Park, {68} with\r\nmeadows and the distant hills beyond.  Going eastward he would find\r\nthat a Henrietta Street and a King Street still led into Covent Garden;\r\nbut the Covent Garden of his time was an open place, with a column and\r\na sun-dial in the middle.  Handsome dwellings for persons of repute and\r\nquality stood on the north side over those arcades which were fondly\r\nsupposed by Inigo Jones, who laid out the spot, to resemble the Piazza\r\nin Venice.  Inigo Jones built the church, too, which is to be seen in\r\nthe \"Morning\" plate of Hogarth's \"Four Times of the Day.\"  This church\r\nwas destroyed by fire in 1795, and was rebuilt in its present form by\r\nHardwick.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Anne's London]\r\n\r\nCharing Cross was still a narrow spot where three streets met; what is\r\nnow Trafalgar Square was covered with houses and the royal mews.  St.\r\nMartin's Church was not built by Gibbs for a dozen years later, in\r\n1726.  Soho and Seven Dials were fashionable neighborhoods; Mrs.\r\nTheresa Cornelys's house of entertainment, of which we hear so much\r\nfrom the writers of the time of Anne, was considered to be most\r\nfashionably situated; ambassadors and peers dwelt in Gerrard Street;\r\nBolingbroke lived in Golden Square.  Traces of former splendor still\r\nlinger about these decayed neighborhoods; paintings by Sir James\r\nThornhill, Hogarth's master and father-in-law, and elaborate marble\r\nmantel-pieces, with Corinthian columns and entablatures, still adorn\r\nthe interiors of some of these houses; bits of quaint Queen Anne\r\narchitecture and finely wrought iron railings still lend an air of\r\nfaded gentility to some of the dingy exteriors.  Parts of London that\r\nare now fashionable had not then come into existence.  Grosvenor Square\r\nwas only begun in 1716, and it was not until 1725 that the new quarter\r\nwas sufficiently advanced for its creator, Sir Richard Grosvenor, to\r\nsummon his intending tenants to a \"splendid entertainment,\" at which\r\nthe new streets and squares were solemnly named.\r\n\r\nThough we of to-day have seen a good deal of what are called Anne and\r\nGeorgian houses, of red brick, {69} curiously gabled, springing up in\r\nall directions, we must not suppose that the London of 1714 was chiefly\r\ncomposed of such cheerful buildings.  Wren and Vanbrugh would be indeed\r\nsurprised if they could see the strange works that are now done, if not\r\nin their name, at least in the name of the age for which they built\r\ntheir heavy, plain, solid houses.  We can learn easily enough from\r\ncontemporary engravings what the principal London streets and squares\r\nwere like when George the Elector became George the King.  There are\r\nnot many remains now of Anne's London, but Queen Anne's Gate, some few\r\nhouses in Queen Square, Bloomsbury, and here and there a house in the\r\nCity preserve the ordinary architecture of the age of Anne.\r\nMarlborough House bears witness to what it did in the way of more\r\npretentious buildings.\r\n\r\nThe insides of these houses were scarcely less like the \"Queen Anne\r\nrevival\" of our time than the outsides.  The rooms were, as a rule,\r\nsparingly furnished.  There would be a centre-table, some chairs, a\r\nsettee, a few pictures, a mirror, possibly a spinet or musical\r\ninstrument of some kind, some shelves, perhaps, for displaying the\r\nChinese and Japanese porcelain which every one loved, and, of course,\r\nheavy window-curtains.  Smaller tables were used for the incessant\r\ntea-drinking.  Large screens kept off the too frequent draughts.\r\nHandsomely wrought stoves and andirons stood in the wide fireplaces.\r\nThe rooms themselves were lofty; the walls of the better kind\r\nwainscoted and carved, and the ceilings painted in allegorical designs.\r\nWall-papers had only begun to come into use within the last few years\r\nof Anne's reign; windows were long and narrow, and small panes were a\r\nnecessity, as glass-makers had not yet attained the art of casting\r\nlarge sheets of glass.  The stairs were exceedingly straight; it was\r\nmentioned as a recommendation to new houses that two persons could go\r\nup-stairs abreast.  The rents would seem curiously low to Londoners of\r\nour time; houses could be got in Pall Mall for two hundred a year, and\r\nin good parts of the town for thirty, forty, and {70} fifty pounds a\r\nyear.  Lady Wentworth, in 1705, describes a house in Golden Square,\r\nwith gardens, stables, and coach-house, the rent of which was only\r\nthreescore pounds a year.  Pretty riverside houses let at from five to\r\nten pounds a year.  Lodgings would seem cheap now, though they were not\r\nheld so then, for Swift complains of paying eight shillings a week,\r\nwhen he lodged in Bury Street, for a dining-room and bedroom on the\r\nfirst floor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--\"Not without danger walk these streets\"]\r\n\r\nThere was no general numbering of houses in 1714; that movement of\r\ncivilization did not take place until 1764.  Places were known by their\r\nsigns, or their vicinity to a sign.  \"Blue Boars,\" \"Black Swans,\" and\r\n\"Red Lions\" were in every street, and people lived at the \"Red Bodice,\"\r\nor over against the \"Pestle.\"  The _Tatler_ tells a story of a young\r\nman seeking a house in Barbican for a whole day through a mistake in a\r\nsign, whose legend read, \"This is the Beer,\" instead of \"This is the\r\nBear.\"  Another tried to get into a house at Stocks Market, under the\r\nimpression that he was at his own lodgings at Charing Cross, being\r\nmisled by the fact that there was a statue of the King on horseback in\r\neach place.  Signs were usually very large, and jutted so far out from\r\nthe houses that in narrow streets they frequently touched one another.\r\nAs it was the fashion to have them carefully painted, carved, gilded,\r\nand supported by branches of wrought iron, they were often very costly,\r\nsome being estimated as worth more than a hundred guineas.\r\n\r\nThe ill-paved streets were too often littered with the refuse which\r\ncareless householders, reckless of fines, flung into the open way.  In\r\nwet weather the rain roared along the kennel, converting all the\r\naccumulated filth of the thoroughfare into loathsome mud.  The\r\ngutter-spouts, which then projected from every house, did not always\r\ncast their cataracts clear of the pavement, but sometimes soaked the\r\nunlucky passer-by who had not kept close to the wall.  Umbrellas were\r\nthe exclusive privilege of women; men never thought of carrying them.\r\nThose whose business or pleasure called them abroad in rainy {71}\r\nweather, and who did not own carriages, might hire one of the eight\r\nhundred two-horsed hackney carriages; jolting, uncomfortable machines,\r\nwith perforated tin sashes instead of window-glasses, and grumbling,\r\never-dissatisfied drivers.  There were very few sedan chairs; these\r\nwere still a comparative novelty for general use, and their bearers\r\nwere much abused for their drunkenness, clumsiness, and incivility.\r\n\r\nThe streets were always crowded.  Coaches, chairs, wheelbarrows, fops,\r\nchimney-sweeps, porters bearing huge burdens, bullies swaggering with\r\ngreat swords, bailiffs chasing some impecunious poet, cutpurses,\r\nfunerals, christenings, weddings, and street fights, would seem from\r\nsome contemporary accounts to be invariably mixed up together in\r\nhelpless and apparently inextricable confusion.  The general\r\nbewilderment was made more bewildering by the very babel of street\r\ncries bawled from the sturdy lungs of orange-girls, chair-menders,\r\nbroom-sellers, ballad-singers, old-clothes men, and wretched\r\nrepresentatives of the various jails, raising their plaintive appeal to\r\n\"remember the poor prisoners.\"  The thoroughfares, however, would have\r\nbeen in still worse condition but for the fact that so much of the\r\npassenger traffic of the metropolis was done by water and not by land.\r\nThe wherries on the Thames were as frequent as the gondolas on the\r\ncanals of Venice.  Across the river, down the river, up the river,\r\npassengers hurried incessantly in the swift little boats that plied for\r\nhire, and were rowed by one man with a pair of sculls, or two men with\r\noars.  Despite the numbers of the river steamers at present, and the\r\ncrowds who take advantage of them, it may well be doubted whether so\r\nlarge a proportion of the passenger traffic of London is borne by the\r\nriver in the days of Queen Victoria as there was in the days of Queen\r\nAnne.\r\n\r\nDarkness and danger ruled the roads at night with all the horrors of\r\nthe Rome of Juvenal.  Oil lamps flickered freely in some of the better\r\nstreets, but even these were not lit so long as any suggestion of\r\ntwilight served for {72} an excuse to delay the illumination.  When the\r\nmoon shone they were not lit at all.  Link-boys drove a busy trade in\r\nlighting belated wanderers to their homes, and saving them from the\r\nperils of places where the pavement was taken up or where open sewers\r\nyawned.  Precaution was needful, for pitfalls of the kind were not\r\nalways marked by warning lanterns.  Footpads roamed about, and worse\r\nthan footpads.  The fear of the Mohocks had not yet faded from civic\r\nmemories, and there were still wild young men enough to rush through\r\nthe streets, wrenching off knockers, insulting quiet people, and\r\ndefying the watch.  Indeed the watch were, as a rule, as unwilling to\r\ninterfere with dangerous revellers as were the billmen of Messina, and\r\nseem to have been little better than thieves or Mohocks themselves.\r\nThey are freely accused of being ever ready to levy black-mail upon\r\nthose who walked abroad at night by raising ingenious accusations of\r\ninsobriety and insisting upon being bought off, or conveying their\r\nvictim to the round-house.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Clubs]\r\n\r\nThe Fleet Ditch, which is almost as much of a myth to our generation as\r\nthe stream of black Cocytus itself, was an unsavory reality still in\r\nthe London which George the First entered.  It was a tributary of the\r\nThames, which, rising somewhere among the gentle hills of Hampstead,\r\nsought out the river and found it at Blackfriars.  At one time it was\r\nused for the conveyance of coals into the city, and colliers of\r\nmoderate size used to ascend it for a short distance.  But towards the\r\nend of Anne's reign, and indeed for long before, it had become a mere\r\ntrickling puddle, discharging its filth and refuse and sewage into the\r\nriver, and poisoning the air around it.\r\n\r\nMay Fair was still, and for many years later, celebrated in the now\r\nfashionable quarter which bears its name.  The fair lasted for six\r\nweeks, and left about six months' demoralization behind it.  \"Smock\r\nraces\"--that is to say, races run by young women for a prize of a laced\r\nchemise, the competitors sometimes being attired only in their\r\nsmocks--were still to be seen in Pall Mall and {73} various other\r\nplaces.  This popular amusement was kept up in London until 1733, and\r\nlingered in country places to a much later time.  Bartholomew Fair was\r\nscarcely less popular, or less renowned for its specialty of roast\r\nsucking-pig, than in the days when Ben Jonson's Master Little-Wit, and\r\nhis wife Win-the-Fight, made acquaintance with its wild humors.  There\r\nis a colored print of about this time which gives a sufficiently vivid\r\npresentment of the fair.  At Lee and Harper's booth the tragedy of\r\n\"Judith and Holofernes\" is announced by a great glaring, painted cloth,\r\nwhile the platform is occupied by a gentleman in Roman armor and a lady\r\nin Eastern attire, who are no doubt the principal characters of the\r\nplay.  A gaudy Harlequin and his brother Scaramouch invite the\r\nattention of the passers-by.  In another booth rope-dancing of men and\r\nwomen is offered to the less tragically minded, and in yet another the\r\nworld-renowned Faux displays the announcement of his conjuring marvels.\r\nA peep-show of the siege of Gibraltar allures the patriotic.\r\nToy-shops, presided over by attractive damsels, lure the light-hearted,\r\nand the light-fingered too, for many an intelligent pickpocket seizes\r\nthe opportunity to rifle the pocket of some too occupied customer.\r\nThere is a revolving swing, and go-carts are drawn by dogs for the\r\ndelight of children.  Hucksters go about selling gin, aniseed, and\r\nfruits, and large booths offer meat, cider, punch, and skittles.  The\r\nplace is thronged with visitors and beggars.  A portly figure in a\r\nscarlet coat and wearing an order is said to be no less a person than\r\nSir Robert Walpole, who is rumored to have occasionally honored the\r\nfair with his presence.\r\n\r\nFew of the clubs that play so important a part in the history of\r\nlast-century London had come into existence in 1714.  The most famous\r\nof them either were not yet founded, or lived only as coffee or\r\nchocolate houses.  There had been literary associations like the\r\n\"Scriblerus\" Club, which was started by Swift, and was finally\r\ndissolved by the quarrels of Oxford and Bolingbroke.  The {74}\r\n\"Saturday\" and \"Brothers\" Clubs had been political societies, at both\r\nof which Swift was all powerful, but they, too, were no more.  The\r\n\"Kit-Kat\" Club, of mystic origin and enigmatic name, with all its\r\nloyalty to Hanover and all its memories of bright toasts, of Steele,\r\nAddison, and Godfrey Kneller, had passed away in 1709, and met no more\r\nin Shire Lane, off Fleet Street, or at the \"Upper Flask\" Inn at\r\nHampstead.  It had not lived in vain, according to Walpole, who\r\ndeclared that its patriots had saved the country.  Within its rooms the\r\nevil-omened Lord Mohun had broken the gilded emblem of the crown off\r\nhis chair.  Jacob Tonson, the bookseller, who was secretary to the\r\nclub, querulously insisted that the man who would do that would cut a\r\nman's throat, and Lord Mohun's fatal career fully justified Tonson's\r\njudgment.  If the Kit-Kat patriots had saved the country, the Tory\r\npatriots of the October Club were no less prepared to do the same.  The\r\nOctober Club came first into importance in the latest years of Anne,\r\nalthough it had existed since the last decade of the seventeenth\r\ncentury.  The stout Tory squires met together in the \"Bell\" Tavern, in\r\nnarrow, dirty King Street, Westminster, to drink October ale, under\r\nDahl's portrait of Queen Anne, and to trouble with their fierce,\r\nuncompromising Jacobitism the fluctuating purposes of Harley and the\r\ncrafty counsels of St. John.  The genius of Swift tempered their hot\r\nzeal with the cool air of his \"advice.\"  Then the wilder spirits\r\nseceded, and formed the March Club, which retained all the angry\r\nJacobinism of the parent body, but lost all its importance.  There were\r\nwilder associations, like the Hell-fire Club, which, under the\r\npresidency of the Duke of Wharton, was distinguished for the desperate\r\nattempts it made to justify its name.  But it was, like its president,\r\nshort lived and soon forgotten.  There are fantastic rumors of a\r\nCalves' Head Club, organized in mockery of all kings, and especially of\r\nthe royal martyrs.  It was said by obscure pamphleteers to be founded\r\nby John Milton; but whether the body ever had any real existence seems\r\nnow to be uncertain.\r\n\r\n{75}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Coffee-houses]\r\n\r\nNext to the clubs came the \"mug-houses.\"  The mug-houses were political\r\nassociations of a humbler order, where men met together to drink beer\r\nand denounce the Whigs or Tories, according to their convictions.  But\r\nat this time the coffee-houses occupied the most important position in\r\nsocial life.  There were a great many of them, each with some special\r\nassociation which still keeps it in men's memories.  At Garraway's, in\r\nChange Alley, tea was first retailed at the high prices which then made\r\ntea a luxury.  The \"Rainbow,\" in Fleet Street, the second coffee-house\r\nopened in London, is mentioned in the _Spectator_; the first was\r\nBowman's, in St. Michael's Alley, Cornhill.  Lloyd's, in Lombard\r\nStreet, was dear to Steele and Addison.  At Don Saltero's, by the river\r\nat Chelsea, Mr. Salter exhibited his collection of curiosities and\r\ndelighted himself, and no one else, by playing the fiddle.  At the\r\n\"Smyrna\" Prior and Swift were wont to receive their acquaintances.\r\nFrom the \"St. James's,\" the last house but one on the south-west corner\r\nof St. James's Street, the _Tatler_ dated its foreign and domestic\r\nnews, and conferred fame on its waiter, Mr. Kidney, \"who has long\r\nconversed with and filled tea for the most consummate politicians.\"  It\r\nwas the head-quarters of Whigs and officers of the Guards; letters from\r\nStella were left here for Swift, and here in later years originated\r\nGoldsmith's \"Retaliation.\"  Will's, at the north corner of Russell\r\nStreet and Bow Street, famous for its memories of Dryden and for the\r\n_Tatler's_ dramatic criticisms, had ceased to exist in 1714.  Its place\r\nwas taken by Button's, at the other side of Russell Street, started by\r\nAddison in 1712.  Here, later, was the lion-head letter-box for the\r\n_Guardian_, designed by Hogarth.  At Child's, in St. Paul's\r\nChurch-yard, the _Spectator_ often smoked a pipe.  Sir Roger de\r\nCoverley was beloved at Squire's, near Gray's Inn Gate.  Slaughter's,\r\nin St. Martin's Lane, was often honored by the presence first of\r\nDryden, and then of Pope.  Serle's, near Lincoln's Inn, was cherished\r\nby the law.  At the \"Grecian,\" in Devereux Court, Strand, learned men\r\nmet and {76} quarrelled; a fatal duel was once fought in consequence of\r\nan argument there over the accent on a Greek word.  At the \"Grecian,\"\r\ntoo, Steele amused himself by putting the action of Homer's \"Iliad\"\r\ninto an exact journal and planning his \"Temple of Fame.\"  From White's\r\nchocolate-house, which afterwards became the famous club, came Mr.\r\nIsaac Bickerstaff's \"Accounts of Gallantry, Pleasure, and\r\nEntertainment.\"  The \"Cocoa Tree\" was the Tory coffee-house, in St.\r\nJames's Street.  Ozinda's chocolate-house, next to St. James's Palace,\r\nwas also a Tory resort, and its owner was arrested in 1715 for supposed\r\ncomplicity in Jacobite conspiracy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Humors of the time]\r\n\r\nTo these coffee and chocolate houses came all the wit and all the\r\nfashion of London.  Men of letters and statesmen, men of the robe and\r\nmen of the sword, lawyers, dandies, poets, and philosophers, met there\r\nto discuss politics, literature, scandal, and the play.  There were\r\noften very strange figures among the motley crowd behind the\r\nred-curtained windows of a St. James's coffee-house.  The gentleman who\r\nmade himself so agreeable to the bar-maid or who chatted so affably\r\nabout the conduct of the allies or the latest news from Sweden, might\r\nmeet you again later on if your road lay at all outside town, and\r\nimperiously request you to stand and deliver.  But of all the varied\r\nassembly the strangest figures must have been the beaux and exquisites,\r\nin all their various degrees of \"dappers,\" \"fops,\" \"smart fellows,\"\r\n\"pretty fellows,\" and \"very pretty fellows.\"  They made a brave show in\r\nmany-colored splendor of attire, heavily scented with orange-flower\r\nwater, civet-violet, or musk, with large falbala periwigs, or long,\r\npowdered duvilliers, with snuff-boxes and perspective glasses\r\nperpetually in their hands, and dragon or right Jamree canes, curiously\r\nclouded and amber headed, dangling by a blue ribbon from the wrist or\r\nthe coat-button.  The staff was as essential to an early Georgian\r\ngentleman as to an Athenian of the age of Pericles, and the\r\ncane-carrying custom incurred the frequent attacks of the satirists.\r\nCane-bearers are made to declare {77} that the knocking of the cane\r\nupon the shoe, leaning one leg upon it, or whistling with it in the\r\nmouth, were such reliefs to them in conversation that they did not know\r\nhow to be good company without it.  Some of these young men appear to\r\nhave affected effeminacy, like an Agathon or a Henri Trois.  Steele has\r\nput it on record that he heard some, who set up to be pretty fellows,\r\ncalling to one another at White's or the St. James's by the names of\r\n\"Betty,\" \"Nelly,\" and so forth.\r\n\r\nServants play almost as important parts as their masters in the humors\r\nof the time.  Rich people were always surrounded by a throng of\r\nservants.  First came the valet de chambre, who was expected to know a\r\nlittle of everything, from shaving and wig-making to skill in country\r\nsports, and had as much experience in all town matters as a servant out\r\nof Terence or Molière.  Last came the negro slave, who waited on my\r\nlord or my lady, with the silver collar of servitude about his neck.\r\n\r\nServants wore fine clothes and aped fine manners.  The footmen of the\r\nLords and Commons held mimic parliament while waiting for their masters\r\nat Westminster, parodying with elaborate care the proceedings of both\r\nHouses.  They imitated their masters in other ways, too, taking their\r\ntitles after the fashion made famous by Gil Blas and his fellow valets,\r\nand familiar by the farce of \"High Life Below Stairs.\"  The writer of\r\nthe _Patriot_ of Thursday, August 19, 1714, satirizes misplaced\r\nambition by \"A discourse which I overheard not many evenings ago as I\r\nwent with a friend of mine into Hyde Park.  We found, as usual, a great\r\nnumber of gentlemen's servants at the park gate, and my friend, being\r\nunacquainted with the saucy custom of those fellows to usurp their\r\nmasters' titles, was very much surprised to hear a lusty rogue tell one\r\nof his companions who inquired after his fellow-servant that his Grace\r\nhad his head broke by the cook-maid for making a sop in the pan.\"\r\nPresently after another assured the company of the illness of my lord\r\nbishop.  \"The information had doubtless continued had {78} not a fellow\r\nin a blue livery alarmed the rest with the news that Sir Edward and the\r\nmarquis were at fisticuffs about a game at chuck, and that the\r\nbrigadier had challenged the major-general to a bout at cudgels.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Principal towns]\r\n\r\nIt is only fair, after enumerating so many of the eccentricities and\r\ndiscomforts of early Georgian London, to mention one proof of\r\ncivilization of which Londoners were able to boast.  London had a\r\npenny-post, of which it was not unreasonably proud.  This penny-post is\r\nthus described in Strype's edition of Stow's \"Survey of London.\"  \"For\r\na further convenience to the inhabitants of this city and parts\r\nadjacent, for about ten miles compass, another post, and that a\r\nfoot-post, commonly called the penny-post, was erected, and though at\r\nfirst set up by a private hand, yet, bring of such considerable amount,\r\nis since taken into the post-office and made a branch of it.  And in\r\nthis all letters and parcels not exceeding a pound weight, and also any\r\nsum of money not above 10 pounds or parcel of 10 pounds value is safely\r\nconveyed, and at the charge of a penny, to all parts of the city and\r\nsuburbs, and but a penny more at the delivery to most towns within ten\r\nmiles of London, and to some towns at a farther distance.  And for the\r\nbetter management of this office there are in London and Westminster\r\nsix general post-offices . . . at all which there constantly\r\nattend . . . officers to receive letters and parcels from the several\r\nplaces appointed to take them in, there being a place or receiving\r\nhouse for the receipt thereof in most streets, with a table hung at the\r\ndoor or shop-window, in which is printed in great letters 'Penny-post\r\nLetters and Parcels are taken in Here.'  And at those houses they have\r\nletter-carriers to call every hour. . . .  All the day long they are\r\nemployed, some in going their walks to bring in, and others to carry\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nThe next town in population to London was Bristol, and Bristol had then\r\nonly one-seventeenth of London's population.  The growth of the\r\nmanufacturing industry, which has created such a cluster of great towns\r\nin the North of England, had hardly begun to show itself when {79}\r\nGeorge the First came to the throne.  Bristol was not only the most\r\npopulous place after London at this time, but it was the great English\r\nseaport.  It had held this rank for centuries.  Even at the time when\r\n\"Tom Jones\" was written, many years after the accession of George the\r\nFirst, the Bristol Alderman filled the same place in popular\r\nimagination that is now assigned to the Alderman of London.  Fielding\r\nattributes to the Bristol Alderman that fine appreciation of the\r\nqualities of turtle soup with which more modern humorists have endowed\r\nhis metropolitan fellow.\r\n\r\nLiverpool was hardly thought of in the early Georgian days.  It was\r\nonly made into a separate parish a few years before George came to the\r\nthrone, and its first dock was opened in 1709.  Manchester was\r\ncomparatively obscure and unimportant, and had not yet made its first\r\nexport of cotton goods.  At this time Norwich, famous for its worsted\r\nand woollen works and its fuller's earth, surpassed it in business\r\nimportance.  By the middle of the century the population of Bristol is\r\nsaid to have exceeded ninety thousand; Norwich, to have had more than\r\nfifty-six thousand; Manchester, about forty-five thousand; Newcastle,\r\nforty thousand; and Birmingham, about thirty thousand; while Liverpool\r\nhad swelled to about thirty thousand, and ranked as the third port in\r\nthe country.  York was the chief city of the Northern Counties; Exeter,\r\nthe capital of the West.  Shrewsbury was of some account in the region\r\ntowards the Welsh frontier.  Worcester, Derby, Nottingham, and\r\nCanterbury were places of note.  Bath had not come into its fashion and\r\nits fame as yet.  Its first pump-room had been built only a few years\r\nbefore George entered England.  The strength of England now, if we\r\nleave London out of consideration, lies in the north, and goes no\r\nfarther southward than a line which would include Birmingham.  In the\r\nearly days of the Georges this was just the part of England which was\r\nof least importance, whether as regards manufacturing energy or\r\npolitical power.\r\n\r\n{80}\r\n\r\nIreland just then was quiet.  It had sunk into a quietude something\r\nlike that of the grave.  Civil war had swept over the country; a\r\nsuccession of civil wars indeed had plagued it.  There was a time just\r\nbefore the outbreak of the parliamentary struggle against Charles the\r\nFirst when, according to Clarendon, Ireland was becoming a highly\r\nprosperous country, growing vigorously in trade, manufacture, letters,\r\nand arts, and beginning to be, as he puts it, \"a jewel of great lustre\r\nin the royal diadem.\"  But civil war and religious persecution had\r\nblighted this rising prosperity, and for the evils coming from\r\npolitical proscription and religious persecution the statesmen of the\r\ntime could think of no remedy but new proscription and fresh\r\npersecution.  Roman Catholics were excluded from the legislature, from\r\nmunicipal corporations, and from the liberal professions; they were not\r\nallowed to teach or be taught by Catholics; they were not permitted to\r\nkeep arms; the trade and navigation of Ireland were put under ruinous\r\nrestrictions and disabilities.  In the reign of Anne new acts had been\r\npassed by the Irish Parliament, and sanctioned by the Crown \"to prevent\r\nthe further growth of Popery.\"  Some of these later measures introduced\r\nnot a few of the very harshest conditions of the penal code against\r\nCatholics.  The Irish Parliament at that time was merely in fact what\r\nhas since been called the British garrison; it consisted of the\r\nconquerors and the settlers.  The Irish people had no more to do with\r\nit, except in the way of suffering under it, than the slaves in Georgia\r\nthirty years ago had to do with the Congress at Washington.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Old Dublin]\r\n\r\nDublin has perhaps changed less than London since 1714, but it has\r\nchanged greatly notwithstanding.  The Irish Parliament was already\r\nestablished in College Green, but not in the familiar building which it\r\nafterwards occupied.  It met in Chichester House, which had been built\r\nas a hospital by Sir George Carew at the close of the sixteenth\r\ncentury.  From him it passed into the possession of Sir Arthur\r\nChichester, an English soldier of {81} fortune, who had distinguished\r\nhimself in France under Henry the Fourth, and who afterwards came to\r\nIreland and played an active part in the plantation of Ulster.  It was\r\nnot until 1728 that Chichester House was pulled down and the new\r\nbuilding erected on its site.  Trinity College, of course, stood on\r\nCollege Green, so did two other stately dwellings, Charlemont House and\r\nClancarty House, both of which have long since passed away.  There were\r\nseveral book-shops on the Green as well, and a great many taverns and\r\ncoffee-shops.  The statue of King William the Third had been set up in\r\n1701.  The collegians professed great indignation at the manner in\r\nwhich the statue turned its back to the college gates, and the effigy\r\nwas the object of many indignities, for which the students sometimes\r\ngot into grave trouble with the authorities.\r\n\r\nSt. Patrick's Well was one of the great features of Dublin in the early\r\npart of the last century.  It stood in the narrow way by Trinity\r\nCollege, the name of which had not long been altered from Patrick's\r\nWell Lane to Nassau Street.  The change had been made in compliment to\r\na bust of William the Third, which adorned the front of one of the\r\nhouses, but for long after the place was much more associated with the\r\nwell than with the House of Orange.  The waters of the well were\r\npopularly supposed to have wonderful curative and health-giving\r\nproperties, and it was much used.  It dried up suddenly in 1729, and\r\ngave Swift the opportunity of writing some fiercely indignant national\r\nverses.  But the water was restored to it in 1731, and it still exists\r\nin peaceful, half-forgotten obscurity in the College grounds.\r\n\r\nDawson Street, off Nassau Street, had only newly come into existence.\r\nIt was called after Joshua Dawson, who had just built for himself a\r\nhandsome mansion with gardens round it.  He sold the house in 1715 to\r\nthe Dublin Corporation, to be used as a Mansion House for their Lord\r\nMayors.  Where Molesworth and Kildare Streets now stand there was at\r\nthis time a great piece of waste {82} land called Molesworth Fields.\r\nChapelizod, now a sufficiently populous suburb, was then the little\r\nvillage of Chappell Isoud, said to be so called from that Belle Isoud,\r\ndaughter of King Anguish of Ireland, who was beloved by Tristram.  The\r\nGeneral Post-office in Sycamore Alley had for Postmaster-general Isaac\r\nManley, who was a friend of Swift.  Manley incurred the Dean's\r\nresentment in 1718 by opening letters addressed to him.  The postal\r\narrangements were, as may be imagined, miserably defective.  Owing to\r\nthe carelessness of postmasters, the idleness of post-boys, bad horses,\r\nand sometimes the want of horses, much time was lost and letters\r\nconstantly miscarried.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Belfast]\r\n\r\nThe amusements of Dublin were those of London on a small scale.  Dublin\r\nwas as fond of its coffee-houses as London itself.  Lucas's, in Cork\r\nStreet, was the favorite resort of beaux, gamesters, and bullies.  Here\r\nTalbot Edgeworth, Miss Edgeworth's ancestor, whom Swift called the\r\n\"prince of puppies,\" displayed his follies, his fine dresses, and his\r\nhandsome face, and believed himself to be the terror of men and the\r\nadoration of women, till he died mad in the Dublin Bridewell.  The yard\r\nbehind Lucas's was the theatre of numerous duels, which were generally\r\nwitnessed from the windows by all the company who happened to be\r\npresent.  These took care that the laws of honorable combat were\r\nobserved.  Close at hand was the \"Swan\" Tavern, in Swan Alley, a\r\ndistrict devoted chiefly to gambling-houses.  On Cork Hill was the\r\ncock-pit royal, where gentlemen and ruffians mingled together to\r\nwitness and wager on the sport.  Cork Hill was not a pleasant place at\r\nnight.  Pedestrians were often insulted and roughly treated by the\r\nchairmen hanging about Lucas's and the \"Eagle\" Tavern.  Even the\r\nwaiters of these establishments sometimes amused themselves by pouring\r\npailfuls of foul water upon the aggrieved passer-by.  It is not\r\nsurprising, therefore, to find that an Irish edition of the Hell-fire\r\nClub was set up at the \"Eagle\" in 1735.  The roughness of the time\r\nfound its way into {83} the theatre in Smock Lane, which was the scene\r\nof frequent political riots.  Dublin had its Pasquin or Marforio in an\r\noaken image, known as the \"Wooden Man,\" which had stood on the southern\r\nside of Essex Street, not far from Eustace Street, since the end of the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\nCork, Limerick, Waterford, and Belfast were the only considerable towns\r\nin Ireland after the Irish capital.  Not many years had passed since\r\nCork was besieged by Marlborough himself, and taken from King James.\r\nThe Duke of Grafton, one of the sons of Charles the Second, was killed\r\nthen in a little street or lane, which still commemorates the fact by\r\nits name.  The same year that saw Marlborough besieging Cork saw\r\nLimerick invested by the forces of King William, under William's own\r\ncommand.  The Irish general, Sarsfield, held out so gallantly that\r\nWilliam had to give up the attempt, and it was not until the following\r\nyear, and after the cause of James had gone down everywhere else, that\r\nSarsfield consented to accept the terms, most honorable to him, of the\r\nfamous Treaty of Limerick.  There was but little feeling in Ireland in\r\nfavor of the Chevalier at the time of Queen Anne's death.  Any sympathy\r\nwith the Stuart cause that still lingered was sentimental merely, and\r\neven as such hardly existed among the great mass of the people.  To\r\nthese, indeed, the change of masters could matter but little; they had\r\nhad enough of the Stuarts, and the conduct of James the Second during\r\nhis Irish campaign had made his name and his memory despised.  Rightly\r\nor wrongly he was charged with cowardice--he who in his early days had\r\nheard his bravery in action praised by the great Turenne--and the\r\ncharge was fatal to him in the minds of the Irish people.  The penal\r\nlaws of Anne's days were not excused because of any strong Jacobite\r\nsympathies or active Jacobite schemes in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe Union between England and Scotland was only seven years old when\r\nGeorge came to the throne of these kingdoms, and already an attempt had\r\nbeen made by a {84} powerful party in Scotland to obtain its repeal.\r\nThe union was unquestionably accomplished by Lord Somers and other\r\nEnglish statesmen, with the object of securing the succession much\r\nrather than the national interests of the Scottish people.  It was for\r\na long time detested in Scotland.  The manner of its accomplishment,\r\nmainly by bribery and threats, made it more odious.  Yet it was based\r\non principles which secured the dearest interests of Scotland and\r\nrespected the religious opinions of the population.  Scottish law,\r\nScottish systems, and the Scotch Church were left without interference,\r\nand constitutional security was given for the maintenance of the\r\nPresbyterian Establishment.  In plain words, the Union admitted and\r\nmaintained the rights and the claims of the great majority of the\r\nScotch people, and therefore, when the first heat of dislike to it had\r\ngone out, Scotland began to find that she could be old Scotland still,\r\neven when combined in one constitutional system with England.  She soon\r\naccepted cordially the conditions which opened new ways to her\r\nindustrial and trading energy, and did not practically interfere with\r\nher true national independence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Life in Edinburgh]\r\n\r\nEdinburgh was then, and remained for generations to come, much the same\r\nas it appeared when Mary Stuart first visited it.  Historians like\r\nBrantôme, and poets like Ronsard, lamented for their fair princess\r\nexiled in a savage land.  But the daughter of the House of Lorraine\r\nmight well have been content with the curious beauty of her new\r\ncapital.  Even now, more than three centuries since Mary Stuart landed\r\nin Scotland, and more than a century and a half since her descendant\r\nraised the standard of rebellion against the Elector of Hanover,\r\nEdinburgh Old Town retains more of its antique characteristics than\r\neither of the capitals of the sister kingdoms.  It is true that the\r\nNorthern Athens has followed the example of its Greek original in\r\nshifting the scene of its social life.  The Attic Athens of to-day\r\noccupies a different site from that of the city of Pericles.  New\r\nEdinburgh {85} has reared itself on the other bank of that chasm where\r\nonce the North River flowed, and where now the trains run.  Edinburgh,\r\nhowever, more fortunate than the city of Cecrops, while founding a new\r\ntown has not lost the old.  But at the time of the Hanoverian\r\naccession, and for generations later, not a house of the new town had\r\nbeen built.  Edinburgh was still a walled city, with many gates or\r\n\"ports,\" occupying the same ground that she had covered in the reign of\r\nJames the Third, along the ridge between the gray Castle on the height\r\nat the west and haunted Holyrood in the plain at the east.  All along\r\nthis ridge rose the huge buildings, \"lands,\" as they were called,\r\nstretching from peak to peak like a mountain-range--five, six,\r\nsometimes ten stories high--pierced with innumerable windows, crowned\r\nwith jagged, fantastic roofs and gables, and as crowded with life as\r\nthe \"Insulae\" of Imperial Rome.  Over all rose the graceful pinnacle of\r\nSt. Giles's Church, around whose base the booths of goldsmiths and\r\nother craftsmen clustered.  The great main street of this old town was,\r\nand is, the Canongate, with its hundred or so of narrow closes or wynds\r\nrunning off from it at right angles.  The houses in these closes were\r\nas tall as the rest, though the space across the street was often not\r\nmore than four or five feet wide.  The Canongate was Edinburgh in the\r\nearly days of the last century far more than St. James's Street was\r\nLondon.  Its high houses, with their wooden panellings, with the old\r\narmorial devices on their doors, and their common stair climbing from\r\nstory to story outside, have seen the whole panorama of Scottish\r\nhistory pass by.\r\n\r\nLife cannot have been very comfortable in Edinburgh.  There were no\r\nopen spaces or squares in the royalty, with the exception of the\r\nParliamentary close.  The houses were so well and strongly built that\r\nthe city was seldom troubled by fire, but they were poor inside, with\r\nlow, dark rooms.  We find, in consequence, that houses inhabited by the\r\ngentry in the early part of the eighteenth century were considered\r\nalmost too bad for very humble {86} folk at its close, and the success\r\nof the new town was assured from the day when its first\r\nfoundation-stone was laid.  But if not very comfortable, life was quiet\r\nand simple.  People generally dined at one or two o'clock in Edinburgh\r\nwhen George the First was king.  Shopkeepers closed their shops when\r\nthey dined, and opened them again for business when the meal was over.\r\nThere was very little luxury; wine was seldom seen on the tables of the\r\nmiddle classes, and few people kept carriages.  There were not many\r\namusements; friends met at each other's houses to take tea at five\r\no'clock, and perhaps to listen to a little music; for the Edinburghers\r\nwere fond of music, and an annual concert which was established early\r\nin the century lingered on till within three years of its close.  But\r\nthis simplicity was not immortal, and we hear sad complaints as the\r\ncentury grows old concerning the decadence of manners made manifest in\r\nthe luxurious practice of dining as late as four or five, the freer use\r\nof wine, and other signs of over-civilization.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Lowland agriculture]\r\n\r\nGlasgow, in the Clyde valley, ranked next to Edinburgh in importance\r\namong Scotch towns.  More than twenty years later than the time of\r\nwhich we treat, the author of a pamphlet called \"Memoirs of the Times\"\r\ncould write, \"Glasgow is become the third trading city in the island.\"\r\nBut in 1714 the future of its commercial prosperity, founded upon its\r\ntrade with the West Indies and the American colonies, had scarcely\r\ndawned.  The Scotch merchants had not yet been able, from want of\r\ncapital, and, it was said, the jealousy of the English merchants, to\r\nmake much use of the privileges conferred upon them by the union, and\r\nGlasgow was on the wrong side of the island for sharing in Scotland's\r\nslight Continental trade.  Still, Glasgow was fairly thriving, thanks\r\nto the inland navigation of the Clyde.  Some of its streets were broad;\r\nmany of its houses substantial, and even stately.  Its pride was the\r\ngreat minster of St. Mungo's, \"a solid, weel-jointed mason-wark, that\r\nwill stand as lang as the warld keep hands and gunpowther aff it,\" to\r\nquote the {87} enthusiastic words of Andrew Fairservice.  The streets\r\nwere often thronged with the wild Highlanders from the hills, who came\r\ndown as heavily and as variously armed as a modern Albanian chieftain,\r\nto trade in small cattle and shaggy ponies.\r\n\r\nAt this time the average Englishman knew little about the Lowlands and\r\nnothing about the Highlands of Scotland.  The Londoner of the age of\r\nAnne would have looked upon any traveller who had made his way through\r\nthe Highlands of Scotland with much the same curiosity as his\r\ndescendants, a generation or two later, regarded Bruce when he returned\r\nfrom Abyssinia, and would probably have received most of his statements\r\nwith a politer but not less profound disbelief.  It was cited, as a\r\nproof of the immense popularity of the _Spectator_, that despite all\r\nthe difficulties of intercommunication it found its way into Scotland.\r\nGeorge the First had passed away, and George the Second was reigning in\r\nhis stead, before any Englishman was found foolhardy enough to explore\r\nthe Scottish Highlands, and lucky enough to escape unhurt, and publish\r\nan account of his experiences, and put on record his disgust at the\r\nmonstrous deformity of the Highland scenery.  But the Londoner in 1714\r\nwas scarcely better informed about the Scotch Lowlands.  What he could\r\nlearn was not of a nature to impress him very profoundly.  Scotland\r\nthen, and for some time to come, was very far behind England in many\r\nthings; most of all, in everything connected with agriculture.  In the\r\nvillages the people dwelt in rude but fairly comfortable cottages, made\r\nchiefly of straw-mixed clay, and straw-thatched.  Wearing clothes that\r\nwere usually home-spun, home-woven, and home-tailored; living\r\nprincipally, if not entirely, on the produce of his own farm, the\r\nLowland farmer passed a life of curious independence and isolation.  To\r\nplough his land, with its strange measurements of \"ox-gate,\"\r\n\"ploughgate,\" and \"davoch,\" he had clumsy wooden ploughs, the very\r\nshape of which is now almost a tradition, but which were certainly at\r\nleast as primitive in {88} construction as the plough Ulysses guided in\r\nhis farm at Ithaca.  Wheeled vehicles of any kind, carts or\r\nwheelbarrows, were rarities.  A parish possessed of a couple of carts\r\nwas considered well provided for.  Even where carts were known, they\r\nwere of little use, they were so wretchedly constructed, and the few\r\nroads that did exist were totally unfit for wheeled traffic.  Roads\r\nwere as rare in Scotland then as they are to-day in Peloponnesus.  An\r\nenterprising Aberdeenshire gentleman, Sir Archibald Grant, of Monymusk,\r\nis deservedly distinguished for the interest he took in road-making\r\nabout the time of the Hanoverian accession.  Some years later statute\r\nlabor did a little--a very little--towards improving the public roads,\r\nbut it was not until after the rebellion of 1745, when the Government\r\ntook the matter in hand, that anything really efficient was done.  A\r\nnumber of good roads were then made, chiefly by military labor, and\r\nreceived in popular language the special title of the King's highways.\r\nBut in the early part of the century there was little use for carts,\r\neven of the clumsiest kind.  Such carriage as was necessary was\r\naccomplished by strings of horses tethered in Indian file, like the\r\nlines of camels in the East, and laden with sacks or baskets.  The\r\ncultivation of the soil was poor; \"the surface was generally\r\nunenclosed; oats and barley the chief grain products; wheat little\r\ncultivated; little hay made for winter; the horses then feeding chiefly\r\non straw and oats.\"  \"The arable land ran in narrow slips,\" with \"stony\r\nwastes between, like the moraines of a glacier.\"  The hay meadow was an\r\nundrained marsh, where rank grasses, mingled with rushes and other\r\naquatic plants, yielded a coarse fodder.  About the time when George\r\nthe First became King of England, Lord Haddington introduced the sowing\r\nof clover and other grass seeds.  Some ten years earlier an\r\nEnglishwoman, Elizabeth Mordaunt, daughter of the Earl of Peterborough,\r\nand wife of the Duke of Gordon, introduced into her husband's estates\r\nEnglish ploughs, English ploughmen, the system of fallowing up to that\r\ntime {89} unknown in Scotland, planted moors, sowed foreign grasses,\r\nand showed the Morayshire farmers how to make hay.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Famines in Scotland]\r\n\r\nAs a natural result of the primitive and incomplete agriculture, dearth\r\nof food was frequent, and even severe famine, in all its horrors of\r\nstarvation and death, not uncommon.  When George the First came to the\r\nthrone the century was not old enough for the living generation of\r\nScotchmen to forget the ghastly seven years that had brought the\r\nseventeenth century to its close--seven empty ears blasted with\r\neast-wind.  So many died of hunger that, in the grim words of one who\r\nlived through that time, \"the living were wearied with the burying of\r\nthe dead.\"  The plague of hunger took away all natural and relative\r\naffections, \"so that husbands had not sympathy for their wives, nor\r\nwives for their husbands; parents for their children, nor children for\r\ntheir parents.\"  The saddest proof of the extent of the suffering is\r\nshown in the irreligious despair which seized upon the sufferers.\r\nScotland then, as now, was strongly marked for its piety, but want made\r\nmen defiant of heaven, prepared, like her who counselled the man of Uz,\r\nto curse God and die by the roadside.  Warned by no dream of thin and\r\nill-favored kine, the Pharaohs of Westminster had passed an Act,\r\nenforced while the famine was well begun, against the importation of\r\nmeal into Scotland.  At the sorest of the famine, the importation of\r\nmeal from Ireland was permitted, and exportation of grain from Scotland\r\nprohibited.  But, in the beginning of the eighteenth century, when the\r\nfamine had but just subsided, a Government commission ordered that all\r\nloads of grain brought from Ireland into the West of Scotland should be\r\nstaved and sunk.\r\n\r\nThe empire over which King George came to rule was as yet in a growing,\r\nalmost a fluid condition.  In North America, England had, by one form\r\nof settlement or another, New York, but lately captured; New Jersey,\r\nthe New England States, such as they then were, Virginia--an old\r\npossession--Maryland, South Carolina, Pennsylvania--settled {90} by\r\nWilliam Penn, whose death was now very near.\r\n\r\nLouisiana had just been taken possession of by the French.  The city of\r\nNew Orleans was not yet built.  The French held the greater part of\r\nwhat was then known of Canada; Jamaica, Barbadoes, and other West\r\nIndian islands were in England's ownership.  The great East Indian\r\nEmpire was only in its very earliest germ; its full development was not\r\nyet foreseen by statesman, thinker, or dreamer.  The English flag had\r\nonly begun to float from the Rock of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{91}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nOXFORD'S FALL; BOLINGBROKE'S FLIGHT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Formation of King George's Cabinet]\r\n\r\nKing George did not make the slightest concealment of his intentions\r\nwith regard to the political complexion of his future government.  He\r\ndid not attempt or pretend to conciliate the Tories, and, on the other\r\nhand, he was determined not to be a puppet in the hands of a \"Junto\" of\r\nillustrious Whigs.  He therefore formed a cabinet, composed\r\nexclusively, or almost exclusively, of pure Whigs; but he composed it\r\nof Whigs who at that time were only rising men in the political world.\r\nHe was going to govern on Whig principles, but he was not going to be\r\nhimself governed by another \"Junto\" of senior Whig statesmen, like that\r\nwhich had been so powerful in the reign of William the Third.  He acted\r\nwith that shrewd, hard common-sense which was an attribute of his\r\nfamily, and which often served instead of genius or enlightenment or\r\nintelligence, or even experience.  A man of infinitely higher capacity\r\nthan George might have found himself puzzled as to his proper policy\r\nunder conditions entirely new and unfamiliar; but George acted as if\r\nthe conditions were familiar to him, and set about governing England as\r\nhe would have set about managing his household in Hanover; and he\r\nsomehow hit upon the course which, under all the circumstances, was the\r\nbest he could have followed.  It is not easy to see how he could have\r\nacted otherwise with safety to himself.  It would have been idle to try\r\nto conciliate the Tories.  The more active spirits among the Tories\r\nwere, in point of fact, conspirators on behalf of the Stuart cause.\r\nThe {92} colorless Tories were not men whose influence or force of\r\ncharacter would have been of much use to the king in endeavoring to\r\nbring about a reconciliation between the two great parties in the\r\nState.  The civil war was not over, or nearly over, yet, and there were\r\nstill to come some moments of crisis, when it seemed doubtful whether,\r\nafter all, the cause supposed to be fallen might not successfully lift\r\nits head again.  As the words of Scott's spirited ballad put it, before\r\nthe Stuart crown was to go down, \"there are heads to be broke.\"  For\r\nGeorge the First to attempt to form a Coalition Cabinet of Whigs and\r\nTories at such a time would have been about as wild a scheme as for M.\r\nThiers to have formed a Coalition Cabinet of Republicans and of\r\nBonapartists, while Napoleon the Third was yet living at Chiselhurst.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--The Treaty of Utrecht]\r\n\r\nThe Tories had been much discredited in the eyes of the country by the\r\nPeace of Utrecht.  The long War of the Succession had been allowed to\r\nend without securing to England and to Europe the one purpose with\r\nwhich it was undertaken by the allies.  It was a war to decide whether\r\na French prince, a grandson of Louis the Fourteenth, and whose\r\naccession seemed to threaten a future union of Spain with France,\r\nshould or should not be allowed to ascend the throne of Spain.  The end\r\nof the war left the French prince on the throne of Spain.  Yet even\r\nthis fact would not in itself have been very distressing or alarming to\r\nthe English people, however it might have pained others of the allied\r\nStates.  The English people probably would never have drawn a sword\r\nagainst France in this quarrel if it had not been for the rash act of\r\nLouis the Fourteenth in recognizing the chevalier, James Stuart, as\r\nKing of England on the death of his father, James the Second.  But\r\nEngland felt bitterly that the Peace of Utrecht left France and Louis\r\nnot only unpunished, but actually rewarded.  All the campaigns, the\r\nvictories, the sacrifices, the genius of Marlborough, the heroism of\r\nhis soldiers, had ended in nothing.  Peace was secured at any price.\r\nIt was not that {93} the people of England did not want to have a peace\r\nmade at the time.  On the contrary, most Englishmen were thoroughly\r\ntired of the war, and felt but little interest in the main objects for\r\nwhich it had been originally undertaken.  Most Englishmen would have\r\nagreed to the very terms which were contained in the Treaty,\r\ndisadvantageous as these conditions were in many points.  But they were\r\nashamed of the manner in which the Treaty had been brought about, more\r\nthan of the Treaty itself.  France lost little or nothing by the\r\narrangement; she sacrificed no territory, and was left with practically\r\nthe same frontier which she had secured for herself twenty years\r\nbefore.  Spain had to give up her possessions in Italy and the Low\r\ncountries.  The Dutch got very little to make up to them for their\r\ntroubles and losses, but they could do nothing for themselves, and the\r\nEnglish statesmen were determined not to continue the war.  Yet, on the\r\nwhole, these terms were not altogether unsatisfactory to the people of\r\nEngland.  The war was becoming an insufferable burden.  The National\r\nDebt was swollen to a size which alarmed at that time and almost\r\nhorrified many persons, and there seemed no chance whatever of the\r\nexpulsion of Philip, the French prince, from Spain.  All these\r\nconsiderations had much influence over the public mind, and possibly\r\nwould of themselves have entirely borne down the arguments of those who\r\ncontended that an opportunity was now come to England of bringing\r\nFrance, so long her principal enemy and greatest danger, completely to\r\nher feet.  Marlborough's victories had, indeed, made it easy to march\r\nto Paris, and dictate there such terms of peace as would keep France\r\npowerless for generations to come.  But the English people were\r\ndisgusted by the manner in which the Treaty of Utrecht had been brought\r\nabout.  In order to secure that arrangement it was absolutely necessary\r\nto destroy the authority of Marlborough, and the Tory statesmen set\r\nabout this work with the most shameless and undisguised pertinacity.\r\nThrough the influence {94} of Mrs. Masham, a cousin of the Duchess of\r\nMarlborough, introduced by the Duchess herself to the Queen, the Tory\r\nstatesmen contrived to get the Whig ministry dismissed, and a ministry\r\nformed under Harley and Bolingbroke.  These statesmen opened secret\r\nnegotiations with France.  They were determined to bring about a peace\r\nby any sort of arrangement.  They betrayed England's allies by entering\r\ninto secret negotiations with the enemy, in express violation of the\r\nconditions of the alliance; they sacrificed the Catalonian populations\r\nof Northern Spain in the most shameless manner.  The Catalans had been\r\nencouraged to rise against the French prince, and England had promised\r\nin return to protect them, and to secure them the restoration of all\r\ntheir ancient liberties.  In making the peace the Catalans were wholly\r\nforgotten.  The best excuse that can be made for the Tory ministers is\r\nto suppose that they positively and actually did forget all about the\r\nCatalans.  Anyhow, the Catalans were left at the mercy of the new King\r\nof Spain, and were treated after the severest fashion of the time in\r\ndealing with conquered but obstinate rebels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Degradation of Marlborough]\r\n\r\nIn order to make such a peace it was necessary to remove Marlborough.\r\nSome accusations were pressed against him to secure his removal.  He\r\nwas charged with having taken perquisites from the contractors who were\r\nsupplying the army with bread, and with having deducted two and one\r\nhalf per cent. from the pay which England allowed to the foreign troops\r\nin her service.  Marlborough's defence would not have been considered\r\nsatisfactory in our day; and indeed it is impossible to think of any\r\nsuch accusation being made, or any such defence being needed, in times\r\nlike ours.  Imagination can hardly conceive the possibility of such\r\ncharges being seriously made against the Duke of Wellington, for\r\nexample, or the Duke of Wellington condescending to plead custom and\r\nusage in reply to them.  But in Marlborough's day things were very\r\ndifferent, and Marlborough was able {95} to show that, as regarded some\r\nof the accusations, he had only done what was customary among men in\r\nhis position, and what he had full authority for doing; and, as\r\nregarded others, that he had applied the sums he got to the business of\r\nthe State as secret service money, and had not made any personal\r\nprofit.  He did not, indeed, produce any accounts; but, assuming his\r\ndefence to be well founded, it is quite possible that the keeping of\r\naccounts might have been an undesirable and inconvenient practice.  At\r\nall events it was certain that Marlborough had not done any worse than\r\nother statesmen of the time, in civil as well as in military service,\r\nhad been in the habit of doing; and considering all the conditions of\r\nthe period, the defence which he set up ought to have been satisfactory\r\nto every one.  It probably would have satisfied his enemies but that\r\nthey were determined to get rid of him.  They were, indeed, compelled\r\nto get rid of him in order to make their secret treaty with France, and\r\nthey succeeded.  Marlborough was dismissed from all his employments,\r\nand went for a time into exile.  The English people, therefore, saw\r\nthat peace had been made by the sacrifice of the greatest English\r\ncommander who, up to that time, had ever taken the field in their\r\nservice.  The treaty had been obtained by the most shameless intrigues\r\nto bring about the downfall of this great soldier.  No matter how\r\ndesirable in itself the peace might be, no matter how reasonable the\r\nconditions on which it was based, yet it became a national disgrace\r\nwhen secured by means like these.  Nor was this all: the Tory statesmen\r\nfinding it imperative for their purpose to have a majority in the House\r\nof Lords, as well as in the House of Commons, prevailed upon the Queen\r\nto stretch her royal prerogative to the extent of making twelve peers.\r\nAll these new peers were Tories; one of them was Mr. Masham, husband of\r\nthe woman who had assisted so efficiently in the degradation of the\r\nDuke of Marlborough.  When they first appeared in the House of Lords, a\r\nWhig statesman ironically asked them {96} whether they proposed to vote\r\nseparately or by their foreman?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--The new Ministry]\r\n\r\nNever, perhaps, has a mean and treacherous policy like that which\r\nbrought about the Treaty of Utrecht had so splendid a literary defence\r\nset up for it.  Swift, with the guidance of Bolingbroke, and put up,\r\nindeed, to the work by Bolingbroke, devoted the best of his powers to\r\ndefame Marlborough, and to justify the conduct of the Tory ministry.\r\nNo matter how clear one's own opinions on the question may be, it is\r\nimpossible, even at this distance of time, to study the writings of\r\nSwift on this subject without finding our convictions sometimes shaken.\r\nThe biting satire, which seems only like cool common-sense and justice\r\ntaking their keenest tone; the masterly array, or perhaps we should\r\nrather say disarray, of facts, dates, and arguments; the bold\r\nassumptions which, by their very case and confidence, bear down the\r\nreader's knowledge and judgment; the clear, unadorned style, made for\r\nconvincing and conquering--all these qualities, and others too, unite\r\nwith almost matchless force to make the worse seem the better cause.\r\nIt is true that the mind of the reader is never impressed by Swift's\r\nvindication of the Tories, as it is always impressed by Burke's\r\ndenunciation of the French Revolution.  Swift does not make one see, as\r\nBurke does, that the whole soul and conscience of the author are in his\r\nwork.  Swift is evidently the advocate retained to conduct the case;\r\nBurke is the man of impassioned conviction, speaking out because he\r\ncannot keep silent.  Still, we have all of us been sometimes made to\r\nquestion our own judgment, and almost to repudiate our own previously\r\nformed impressions as to facts, by the skill of some great advocate in\r\na court of law; and it is skill of this kind, and of the very highest\r\norder, that we have to recognize in Swift's efforts to justify the\r\npolicy of the Treaty of Utrecht.  To make out any case it was necessary\r\nto endeavor to lower Marlborough in the estimation of the English\r\npeople, just as it was necessary to destroy his power in order to get\r\nthe ground open for the {97} arrangement of the treaty.  Swift set\r\nhimself to this task with a malignity equal to his genius.  Arbuthnot,\r\nhardly inferior as a satirist to Swift, wrote a \"History of John Bull,\"\r\nto hold up Marlborough and Marlborough's wife to ridicule and to\r\nhatred.  He depicted the great soldier as a low and roguish attorney,\r\nwho was deluding his clients into the carrying on of a long and costly\r\nlawsuit for the mere sake of putting money into his own pocket.  He\r\nlampooned England's allies as well as England's great general; he\r\ndescribed the Dutch, whom the Tory ministers had shamefully betrayed,\r\nas self-seeking and perfidious traitors, for whose protection we were\r\nsacrificing all, until we found out that they were secretly juggling\r\nwith our enemies for our destruction.  No stronger argument could be\r\nfound to condemn the conduct of the Tory ministers than the mere fact\r\nthat Swift and Arbuthnot failed to secure their acquittal at the bar of\r\npublic opinion.  All the attacks on Marlborough were inspired by\r\nBolingbroke, and it has only to be added that Marlborough had been\r\nBolingbroke's first and best benefactor.\r\n\r\nThe King appointed Lord Townshend his Secretary of State.  The office\r\nwas then regarded as that of First Lord of the Treasury is now; it\r\ncarried with it the authority of Prime-minister.  James Stanhope was\r\nSecond Secretary.  Walpole was at first put in the subordinate office\r\nof Paymaster-general, without a seat in the Cabinet; a place in\r\nAdministration which at a later period was assigned to no less a man\r\nthan Edmund Burke.  Walpole's political capacity soon, however, made it\r\nevident that he was fitted for higher office, and we shall find that he\r\ndoes not remain long at the post of Paymaster-general.  The Duke of\r\nShrewsbury had resigned both his offices: that of Lord Treasurer, and\r\nthat of Viceroy of Ireland.  Lord Sunderland accepted the Irish\r\nViceroyalty, and the Lord Treasurership was put into commission, and\r\nfrom that time was heard of no more.  Next to Walpole himself, the most\r\nnotable man in the administration--the man, that is to say, who became\r\nbest known to the world afterwards--was {98} Pulteney, now Walpole's\r\ndevoted friend, before long to be his bitter and unrelenting enemy.\r\nPulteney, just now, is still a very young man, only in his thirty-third\r\nyear; but he is the hereditary representative of good Whig principles,\r\nand has already distinguished himself in the House of Commons as a\r\nskilful and fearless advocate of his political faith; he is a keen and\r\nclever pamphleteer; in later days, if he had lived then, he would\r\ndoubtless have been a writer of leading articles in newspapers.  His\r\nstyle is polished and penetrating, like that of an epigrammatist.  He\r\nhas travelled much for that time, and is what was then called an\r\nelegant scholar.  The eloquent and silver-tongued Lord Cowper was\r\nrestored to the office of Lord Chancellor, which he had already held\r\nunder Queen Anne, and by virtue of which he had presided at the\r\nimpeachment of Sacheverell.  When Cowper was made Lord Keeper of the\r\nGreat Seal by Anne in 1705, he was in the forty-first year of his age,\r\nbut looked very much younger.  He wore his own hair at that time, an\r\nunusual thing in Anne's days, and this added to his juvenile\r\nappearance.  The Queen insisted that he must have his hair cut off and\r\nmust wear a heavy wig; otherwise, she said, the world would think she\r\nhad given the seals to a boy.  Cowper was a prudent, cautious, clever\r\nman, whose abilities made a considerable impression upon his own time,\r\nbut have carried his memory only in a faint and feeble way on to ours.\r\nHe was a fine speaker, so far as style and manner went, and he had a\r\ncharming voice.  Chesterfield said of him that the ears and the eyes\r\ngave him up the hearts and understandings of the audience.  The Duke of\r\nArgyll became Commander-in-chief for Scotland.  In Ireland, Sir\r\nConstantine Phipps was removed from the office of Chancellor, on the\r\nground of his Jacobite opinions; and it is a curious fact, worth noting\r\nas a sign of the times, that the University of Oxford unanimously\r\nagreed to confer on him an honorary degree almost immediately after--on\r\nthe day, in fact, of the King's coronation.\r\n\r\n{99}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Lord Townshend]\r\n\r\nLord Townshend, the Prime-minister, as we may call him, was not a man\r\nof any conspicuous ability.  He belonged to that class of competent,\r\ncapable, trustworthy Englishmen who discharge satisfactorily the duties\r\nof any office to which they are called in the ordinary course of their\r\nlives.  Such a man as Townshend would have made a respectable Lord\r\nMayor or a satisfactory Chairman of Quarter Sessions, if fortune had\r\nappointed him to no higher functions.  He might have changed places\r\nprobably with an average Lord Mayor or Chairman of Quarter Sessions\r\nwithout any particular effect being wrought on English history.  Men of\r\nthis stamp have nothing but official rank in common with the statesmen\r\nPrime-ministers--the Walpoles and Peels and Palmerstons; or with the\r\nmen of genius--the Pitts and Disraelis and Gladstones.  Lord Townshend\r\nhad performed the regular functions of a statesman in training at that\r\ntime.  He had been an Envoy Extraordinary, and had made treaties.  He\r\nwas a brother-in-law of Walpole.  Just now Walpole and he are friends\r\nas well as connections; the time came when Walpole and he were destined\r\nto quarrel; and then Townshend conducted himself with remarkable\r\nforbearance, self-restraint, and dignity.  He was an honest and\r\nrespectable man, blunt of speech, and of rugged, homespun intelligence,\r\nabout whom, since his day, the world is little concerned.  Such name as\r\nhe had is almost absorbed in the more brilliant reputation of his\r\ngrandson--the spoiled child of the House of Commons, as Burke called\r\nhim--that Charles Townshend of the famous \"Champagne Speech;\" the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, of whom we shall hear a good deal later\r\non, and who, by the sheer force of animal spirits, feather-headed\r\ntalents, and ignorance, became, in a certain perverted sense, the\r\nfather of American Independence.\r\n\r\nThe Second Secretary of State, James, afterwards Earl, Stanhope, was a\r\nman of very different mould.  Stanhope was one of the few Englishmen\r\nwho have held high position in arms and politics.  He had been a\r\nbrilliant {100} soldier; had fought in Flanders and Spain; had\r\ndistinguished himself at Barcelona, even under a commander like\r\nPeterborough, whose daring spirit rendered it hard for any subaltern to\r\nshine in rivalry; had been himself raised to command, and kept on\r\nwinning victories until his military genius found itself overcrowed by\r\nthat of the great French captain, the Duke de Vendôme.  His soldier's\r\ncareer came to a premature close, as indeed his whole mortal career did\r\nnot very long after the time at which we have now arrived.  Stanhope\r\nwas a man of scholarly education, almost a scholar; he had abilities\r\nabove the common; he had indomitable energy, and was as daring and\r\nresolute in the council as in the field.  He had a domineering mind,\r\nwas outspoken and haughty, trampling over other men's opinions as a\r\ncharge of cavalry treads down the grasses of the field it traverses.\r\nHe made enemies, and did not heed their enmity.  He was single-minded,\r\nand, what was not very common in that day, he was free from any love of\r\nmoney or taint of personal greed.  He does not rank high either among\r\nstatesmen or soldiers, but as statesman and soldier together he has\r\nmade for himself a distinct and a peculiar place.  His career will\r\nalways be remembered without effort by the readers of English history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Coronation of the King]\r\n\r\nA new Privy Council was formed which included the name of Marlborough.\r\nThe Duchess of Marlborough urged her husband not to accept this office\r\nof barren honor.  It is said that the one only occasion on which\r\nMarlborough had ventured to act against the dictation of his wife was\r\nwhen he thus placed himself again at the disposal of the King.  He\r\nnever ceased to regret that he had not followed her advice in this\r\ninstance as in others.  His proud heart soon burned within him when he\r\nfound that he was appreciated, understood, and put aside; mocked with a\r\nsemblance of power, humiliated under the pretext of doing him honor.\r\n\r\nMuch more humiliating, much more ominous, however, was the reception\r\nawaiting Oxford and Bolingbroke.  From the moment of his arrival, the\r\nKing showed himself {101} determined to take no friendly notice of the\r\ngreat Tories.  Oxford found it most difficult even to get audience of\r\nhis Majesty.  The morning after the King's arrival, Oxford was allowed,\r\nafter much pressure and many entreaties, to wait upon the Sovereign,\r\nand to kiss his hand.  He was received in chilling silence.  Truly, it\r\nwas not likely that much conversation would take place, seeing that\r\nGeorge spoke no English and Oxford spoke no German.  But there was\r\nsomething in the King's demeanor towards him, as well as in the mere\r\nfact that no words were exchanged, which must have told Oxford that his\r\nenemies were in triumph over him, and were determined to bring about\r\nhis doom.  Even before George had landed in England he had sent\r\ndirections that Bolingbroke should be removed from his place of\r\nSecretary of State.  On the last day of August this order was executed\r\nin a manner which made it seem especially premature, and even\r\nignominious.  The Privy Council, as it stood, was then dissolved, and\r\nthe new Council appointed, which consisted of only thirty-three\r\nmembers.  Somers was one of this new Council, but in name alone; his\r\ngrowing years, his increasing infirmities, and the flickering decay of\r\nhis once great intellect, allowed him but little chance of ever again\r\ntaking an active part in the affairs of the State.  Marlborough was\r\nnamed a member of it, as we have seen.  The Lords Justices ordered that\r\nall despatches addressed to the Secretary of State should be brought to\r\nthem.  Bolingbroke himself had to wait at the door of the Council\r\nChamber with his despatch-box, to receive the commands of his new\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\nFrance, tired of war, recognized the new King of England.  The\r\ncoronation of the King took place on October 20th; Bolingbroke and\r\nOxford were both present.  We learn from some of the journals of the\r\nday that it had rained on the previous afternoon, and that many of the\r\nJacobites promised themselves that the rain would continue to the next\r\nday, and so retard, if only for a few hours, the hateful ceremony.  But\r\ntheir hopes of foul weather {102} were disappointed.  The rain did not\r\nkeep on, and the coronation took place successfully in London; not,\r\nhowever, without some Jacobite disturbances in Bristol, Birmingham,\r\nNorwich, and other places.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714--Flight of Bolingbroke]\r\n\r\nThe Government soon after issued a proclamation dissolving the existing\r\nParliament, and another summoning a new one.  The latter called on all\r\nthe electors of the kingdom, in consequence of the evil designs of men\r\ndisaffected to the King, \"to have a particular regard to such as showed\r\na firmness to the Protestant Succession when it was in danger.\"  The\r\nappeal was clearly unconstitutional, according to our ideas, but it was\r\nmade, probably, in answer to James Stuart's manifesto a few weeks\r\nbefore, in which the Pretender reasserted his claims to the throne, and\r\ndeclared that he had only waited until the death \"of the Princess, our\r\nsister, of whose good intentions towards us we could not for some time\r\npast well doubt.\"\r\n\r\nThe general elections showed an overwhelming majority for the Whigs.\r\nThe not unnatural fluctuations of public opinion at such a time are\r\neffectively illustrated by the sudden and complete manner in which the\r\nmajority was transferred, now to this side, now to that.  Just at this\r\nmoment, and indeed for long after, the Whigs had it all their own way.\r\nOnly a few years ago their fortunes had seemed to have sunk to zero,\r\nand now they had mounted again to the zenith.  The King opened\r\nParliament in person; the Speech was read for him by the Lord\r\nChancellor, for the very good reason that George could not pronounce\r\nEnglish.  That Speech declared that the established Constitution,\r\nChurch and State, should be the rule of his Government.  The debate on\r\nthe Address was remarkable.  In the House of Lords the Address\r\ncontained the words, \"To recover the reputation of this kingdom.\"\r\nBolingbroke made his last speech in Parliament.  He objected to these\r\nwords, and proposed an amendment, with an eloquence and an energy\r\nworthy of his best days, and with a front as seemingly fearless as\r\nthough his fortunes were at the full.  He contended that to talk of\r\n{103} \"recovering\" the reputation of the kingdom was to cast a stigma\r\non the glory of the late reign.  He proposed to substitute the word\r\n\"maintain\" for the word \"recover.\"  His amendment was defeated by\r\nsixty-six votes to thirty-three: exactly two to one.  In the House of\r\nCommons the Address, which was moved by Walpole, contained words still\r\nmore significant.  The Address spoke of the Pretender's attempts \"to\r\nstir up your Majesty's subjects to rebellion,\" declared that his hopes\r\n\"were built upon the measures that had been taken for some time past in\r\nGreat Britain,\" and added: \"It shall be our business to trace out those\r\nmeasures whereon he placed his hopes, and to bring the authors of them\r\nto condign punishment.\"  These words were the first distinct intimation\r\ngiven by the Ministers that they intended to call their predecessors to\r\naccount.  Stanhope stated their resolve still more explicitly in the\r\ncourse of the debate.  Bolingbroke sat and heard it announced that he\r\nand his late colleague were to be impeached for high-treason.  He put\r\non an appearance of serenity and philosophic boldness for a time, but\r\nin his heart he had already taken fright.  For a few days he went about\r\nin public, showing himself ostentatiously, with all the manner of a man\r\nwho is happy in his unwonted ease, and is only anxious for relaxation\r\nand amusement.  He professed to be rejoiced by his release from office,\r\nand those of his friends who wished to please him offered him their\r\nformal congratulations on his promotion to a retirement that placed him\r\nabove the petty struggles and cares of political life.  He visited\r\nDrury Lane Theatre on March 26, 1715, went about among his friends,\r\nchatted, flirted, paid compliments, received compliments, arranged to\r\nattend another performance at the same theatre the following evening.\r\nThat same night he disguised himself as a serving-man, slipped quietly\r\ndown to Dover, escaped from thence to Calais, and went hurriedly on to\r\nParis, ready to place himself and his talents and his influence--such\r\nas it might be--at the service of the Stuarts.\r\n\r\nThere seems good reason to believe that the Duke of {104} Marlborough,\r\nby a master-stroke of treachery, avenged himself on Bolingbroke at this\r\ncrisis in Bolingbroke's fortunes, and decided the flight to Paris.\r\nBolingbroke sought out Marlborough, and appealing to the memories of\r\ntheir old friendship, begged for advice and assistance.  Marlborough\r\nprofessed the utmost concern for Bolingbroke, and gave him to\r\nunderstand that it was agreed upon between the Ministers of the Crown\r\nand the Dutch Government that Bolingbroke was to be brought to the\r\nscaffold.  Marlborough pretended to have certain knowledge of this, and\r\nhe told Bolingbroke that his only chance was in flight.  Bolingbroke\r\nfled, and thereby seemed to admit in advance all the accusations of his\r\nenemies and to abandon his friends to their mercy.  One of\r\nBolingbroke's biographers appears to consider that on the whole this\r\nwas well done by Marlborough, and that it was only a fair retaliation\r\non Bolingbroke.  In any case, it is clear that Bolingbroke acted in\r\nstrict consistency with the principles on which he had moulded his\r\npublic and private life; he consulted for himself first of all.  It may\r\nhave been necessary for his own safety that he should fly from the\r\nthreatening storm, It is certain that he had bitter and unrelenting\r\nenemies.  These would not have spared him if they could have made out a\r\ncase against him.  No one but Bolingbroke himself could know to the\r\nfull how much of a case there was against him.  But his flight, if it\r\nsaved himself, might have been fatal to those who were in league with\r\nhim for the return of the Stuarts.  If he had stood firm, it is\r\nprobable that his enemies would not have been able to prevail any\r\nfurther against him than they were able to prevail in his absence\r\nagainst Harley, whom his flight so seriously compromised.  Nobody needs\r\nto be told that the one last hope for conspirators whose plans are\r\nbeing discovered is for all in the plot to stand together or all to fly\r\ntogether.  Bolingbroke does not seem to have given his associates any\r\nchance of considering the position and making up their minds.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1715--The Committee of Secrecy]\r\n\r\nA committee of secrecy was struck.  It was composed {105} of twenty-one\r\nmembers, and the hearts of Bolingbroke's friends may well have sunk\r\nwithin them as they studied the names upon its roll.  Many of its\r\nmembers were conscientious Whigs--Whigs of conviction, eaten up with\r\nthe zeal of their house, like James Stanhope himself, and Spencer\r\nCowper and Lord Coningsby and young Lord Finch and Pulteney, now in his\r\nperiod of full devotion to Walpole.  There were Whig lawyers, like\r\nLechmere; there were steady, obtuse Whigs, like Edward Wortley Montagu,\r\nhusband of the brilliant and beautiful woman whom Pope first loved and\r\nthen hated.  There was Aislabie, then Treasurer of the Navy, afterwards\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, who came to disgrace at the bursting of\r\nthe South Sea Bubble, and who would at any time have elected to go with\r\nthe strongest, and loved to tread the path lighted by his own\r\nimpressions as to his own interests.  Thomas Pitt, grandfather to the\r\ngreat Chatham, the \"Governor Pitt\" of Madras, whose diamonds were\r\nobjects of admiration to Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, was a member of the\r\ncommittee; and so was Sir Richard Onslow, afterwards speaker of the\r\nHouse of Commons, and uncle of the much more celebrated \"Speaker\r\nOnslow.\"  From none of these men could Bolingbroke have much favor to\r\nexpect.  Those who were honest and unselfish would be ill-disposed\r\ntowards him because of their honesty and unselfishness; those who were\r\nnot exactly honest and certainly not unselfish, would, by reason of\r\ntheir character, probably be only too anxious to help the winning party\r\nto get rid of him.  But the names that must have showed most formidable\r\nin the eyes of Bolingbroke and his friends were those of Robert Walpole\r\nand Richard Hampden.  Two years before this time the persistent enmity\r\nof Bolingbroke had sent Walpole to the Tower, branded with the charge\r\nof corruption and expelled from the House of Commons.  Now things are\r\nchanged indeed.  Walpole is chairman of the committee, and \"Hast thou\r\nfound me, oh, mine enemy?\"  St. John had threatened Hampden, who was a\r\nlineal descendant of the {106} Hampden of the Civil War, with the\r\nTower, for daring to censure the Ministry of the day, and was only\r\ndeterred from carrying out his threat by prudent counsellors, who\r\nshowed him that Hampden would be only too proud to share Walpole's\r\nimprisonment.  These were men not likely to forget or to forgive such\r\ninjuries.\r\n\r\nAt first the Tories seem scarcely to have believed that the Whigs would\r\npush their policy to extremities.  The eccentric Jacobite Shippen\r\npublicly scoffed at the committee, and declared in the Mouse of Commons\r\nthat its investigations would vanish into smoke.  Such confidence was\r\nquickly and rudely shattered.  June 9th saw a memorable scene.  On that\r\nday Robert Walpole, as chairman of the Committee of Secrecy, rose and\r\ntold the House of Commons that he had to present a report, but that he\r\nwas commanded by the committee to move in the first instance that a\r\nwarrant be issued by the Speaker to apprehend several persons who\r\nshould be named by him, and that meantime no member be permitted to\r\nleave the House.  Thereupon the lobbies were cleared of all strangers,\r\nand the Sergeant-at-arms stood at the door in order to prevent any\r\nmember from going out.  Then Walpole named Mr. Matthew Prior, Mr.\r\nThomas Harley, and other persons, and the Speaker issued his warrant\r\nfor their arrest.  Mr. Prior was arrested at once; Mr. Harley a few\r\nhours afterwards.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1715--\"Most contagious treason\"]\r\n\r\nPrior was the poet, the friend and correspondent of Bolingbroke.  He\r\nhad been much engaged in the negotiations for the Treaty of Utrecht,\r\nand had at one time actually held the rank of English Envoy.  He had\r\nbut lately returned from Paris; had arrived in London just before\r\nBolingbroke's flight.  Thomas Harley, cousin of Lord Oxford, had also\r\nbeen concerned in the negotiations in a less formal and more underhand\r\nsort of way.  When the arrests had been ordered, Walpole informed the\r\nHouse that the Committee of Secrecy had agreed upon their report, and\r\nhad commanded him to submit it to the House of Commons.  The report,\r\nwhich Walpole himself, as {107} chairman of the committee, had drawn\r\nup, was a document of great length; it occupied many hours in the\r\nreading.  But the time could not have seemed tedious to those who\r\nlistened.  The report was an indictment and a State paper combined.  It\r\narrayed with the utmost skill all the evidences and arguments, all the\r\nfacts and all the passages of correspondence, necessary to make out a\r\ncase against the accused statesmen.  It carried with it, beyond\r\nquestion, the complete historical condemnation of Oxford and\r\nBolingbroke in all that related to the Treaty of Utrecht.  Never was it\r\nmore conclusively established for the historian that Ministers of State\r\nhad used the basest means to bring about the basest objects.  It was\r\nmade clear as light that the national interests and the national honor\r\nhad been sacrificed for partisan and for personal purposes.  Objects in\r\nthemselves criminal for statesmen to aim at had been sought by means\r\nwhich would have been shameful even if employed for justifiable ends.\r\nHad Bolingbroke and Oxford been endeavoring to save the State by the\r\narts which they employed to sacrifice it, their conduct would have\r\ncalled for the condemnation of all honest men.  But as regards the\r\ntransactions with James Stuart there was ample ground shown for\r\nsuspicion, there was good reason to conjecture or to infer, but there\r\nwas no positive evidence of intended treason.  A historian reading over\r\nthe report would in all probability come to the conclusion that Oxford\r\nand Bolingbroke had been plotting with James Stuart, but he would not\r\nsee in it satisfactory grounds for an impeachment.  No jury would\r\nconvict on such evidence; no jury probably would even leave the box for\r\nthe purpose of considering their verdict.  In the course of the events\r\nthat were soon to follow it was placed beyond any doubt that\r\nBolingbroke and Oxford had all along been trying to arrange for the\r\nreturn of the Stuarts.  They were not driven to throw themselves in\r\ndespair into the Stuart cause by reason of harsh proceedings taken\r\nagainst them by their enemies in England; they had been \"pipe-laying,\"\r\nto use an expressive {108} American word, for the Stuart restoration\r\nduring all the closing years of Queen Anne's reign.  The reader must\r\ndecide for himself as to the degree of moral or political guilt\r\ninvolved in such transactions.  It has to be remembered that nearly\r\nhalf--some still say more than half--of the population of these\r\ncountries was in favor of such a restoration, and that Anne herself\r\nunquestionably leaned to the same view.  What is certain is that Oxford\r\nand Bolingbroke were planning for it.  But what seems equally clear is\r\nthat the report of the Secret Committee did not contain satisfactory\r\nevidence on which to sustain a charge of treason.  Swift is not a\r\ntrustworthy witness on these subjects, but he is quite right when he\r\nsays that the allegations were \"more proper materials to furnish out a\r\npamphlet than an impeachment.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1715--\"An intricate impeach is this!\"]\r\n\r\nBolingbroke's friends must have felt deeply grieved at his flight when\r\nthey heard the statement of the case against him.  Even as regards the\r\nTreaty of Utrecht, it seems questionable whether the historical\r\nconviction assuredly obtained against him by the contents of the report\r\nwould, in the existing condition of politics and parties, have been\r\nfollowed by any sort of judicial conviction, whether in a court of law\r\nor a trial by Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe day after the reading of the report gave Walpole his long-desired\r\nrevenge; he impeached Bolingbroke of high-treason.  There was a dead\r\nsilence in the House when he had finished.  Then two of Bolingbroke's\r\nfriends, Mr. Hungerford and General Ross, mustered up courage to speak\r\na few words for their lost leader.  The star of the morning, the Tory\r\nLucifer, had fallen indeed!  Lord Coningsby got up and made a clever\r\nlittle set speech.  Walpole had impeached the hand, and Lord Coningsby\r\nimpeached the head; Walpole had impeached the clerk, and Coningsby\r\nimpeached the justice; Walpole had impeached the scholar, and Coningsby\r\nimpeached the master.  This head, this justice, this master, was, of\r\ncourse, the Lord Oxford.  As a piece of dramatic declamation {109}\r\nConingsby's impeachment was telling enough; as a historical\r\npresentation of the case against the two men it was absurd.  Through\r\nall Anne's later years Oxford had been nothing and Bolingbroke\r\neverything.  On the very eve of the Queen's death Bolingbroke had\r\nsecured his triumph over his former friend by driving Oxford out of all\r\noffice.  Had Oxford been first impeached, and the speech of Lord\r\nConingsby been aimed at Bolingbroke, it would have been strikingly\r\nappropriate; as it was, it became meaningless rhetoric.  Next day\r\nOxford went to the House of Lords, and tried to appear cool and\r\nunconcerned, but, according to a contemporary account, \"finding that\r\nmost members avoided sitting near him, and that even the Earl Powlet\r\nwas shy of exchanging a few words with him, he was dashed out of\r\ncountenance, and retired out of the House.\"\r\n\r\nImpeachments were now the order of the day.  The loyal Whigs of the\r\nCommons were incessantly passing between the Upper House and the Lower\r\nwith articles of impeachment, and still further articles when the first\r\nwere not found to be strong enough for the purpose.  Stanhope impeached\r\nthe Duke of Ormond; Aislabie impeached Lord Strafford--not of\r\nhigh-treason, but of high crimes and misdemeanors; Strafford was\r\naccused of being not only \"the tool of a Frenchified ministry,\" but the\r\nadviser of most pernicious measures.  Strafford's part in the\r\nnegotiations had not been one of any considerable importance.  He had\r\nbeen sent as English Plenipotentiary to the Congress at Utrecht.\r\nAssociated with him as Second Plenipotentiary was Dr. John Robinson,\r\nthen Bishop of Bristol, and more lately made Bishop of London, the\r\nchurchman on whom the office of the Privy Seal had been conferred by\r\nHarley, to the great anger of the Whigs.  It was said that Strafford,\r\nin his high and mighty way, had refused flatly to accept a mere poet\r\nlike Prior for his official colleague.  Strafford had, in reality,\r\nlittle or nothing to do with the making of the Treaty.  The\r\nnegotiations were carried on between Bolingbroke and {110} the Marquis\r\nde Torcy, French Secretary of State and nephew of the great Colbert;\r\nand when these wanted agents they employed men more clever and less\r\npompous than Strafford.  Aislabie, in bringing on his motion, drew a\r\ncurious distinction between Strafford and Strafford's official\r\ncolleague.  \"The good and pious Prelate,\" he said, had been only a\r\ncipher, and \"seemed to have been put at the head of that negotiation\r\nonly to palliate the iniquity of it under the sacredness of his\r\ncharacter.\"  He was glad, therefore, that nothing could be charged upon\r\nthe Bishop, and complacently observed that the course taken with regard\r\nto Dr. Robinson, who was not to be impeached, \"ought to convince the\r\nworld that the Church was not in danger.\"  There was some wisdom as\r\nwell as wit in a remark made thereupon by a member of the House in\r\nopposing the motion--\"the Bishop, it seems, is to have the benefit of\r\nclergy.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1715--Ormond's hesitation]\r\n\r\nThe motions for the impeachment of Bolingbroke and Oxford were carried\r\nwithout a division.  This fact, however, would be little indication as\r\nto the result of an impeachment after a long trial, and after the minds\r\nof men had cooled down on both sides; when Whigs had grown less\r\npassionate in their hate, and Tories had recovered their courage to\r\nsustain their friends.  Even at the moment the impeachment of the Duke\r\nof Ormond was a matter of far greater difficulty.  Ormond had many\r\nfriends, even among the most genuine supporters of the Hanoverian\r\nsuccession.  He was the idol of the High-Church party; at all events,\r\nof the High-Church mob.  Had he acted with anything like a steady\r\nresolve he would, in all probability, have escaped even impeachment.\r\nTo some of the most serious charges against him, his refusal, for\r\ninstance, to attack the French while the secret negotiations for the\r\nTreaty of Utrecht were going on, he could fairly have pleaded that he\r\nhad acted only as a soldier taking positive instructions and carrying\r\nthem out.  His clear and obvious policy would have been to take the\r\nquiet stand of a man conscious of innocence, and {111} therefore not\r\nafraid of the scrutiny of any committee or the judgment of any tribunal.\r\n\r\nBut Ormond hesitated.  Ormond was always hesitating.  Many of his\r\ninfluential supporters urged him to seek an audience of the King at\r\nonce, and to profess to George his unfailing and incorruptible loyalty.\r\nHad he taken such a course it is not at all unlikely that the King\r\nmight have caused the measures against him to be abandoned.  Ormond's\r\nfriends, indeed, were full of hope that they could, in any case, induce\r\nthe Ministry not to persevere in the proceedings against him.  On the\r\nother hand, he was urged to join in an insurrection in the West of\r\nEngland, towards which, beyond doubt, he had already himself taken some\r\nsteps.  The less cautious of his friends assured him that his\r\nappearance in the West would be welcomed with open arms, and would\r\nbring a vast number of adherents round him, and that a powerful blow\r\ncould be struck at once against the Hanoverian succession.  Ormond,\r\nhowever, took neither the one course nor the other.  To do him justice,\r\nhe was far too honorable for the utter perfidy of the first course, and\r\nit is doing him no injustice to say that he was too feeble for the\r\ndaring enterprise of the second.  It is believed that Ormond had an\r\ninterview with Oxford before his flight, and that he urged Oxford to\r\nattempt an escape in terms not unlike those with which William the\r\nSilent, in Goethe's play, endeavors to persuade Egmont not to remain in\r\nthe power of Philip the Second.  Then Ormond himself fled to France.\r\nHe lived there for thirty years after.  He led a pleasant, easy,\r\nharmless life, and was completely forgotten in England for years and\r\nyears before his death.  More than twenty years after his flight he is\r\ndescribed by vivacious Mary Wortley Montagu as \"one who seems to have\r\nforgotten every part of his past life, and to be of no party.\"  He was\r\na weak man, with only a very faint outline of a character; but he was\r\nmore honorable and consistent than was common with the men of his time.\r\nWhen he had once taken up a cause or a principle he held to it.  {112}\r\nHe was the very opposite to Bolingbroke.  Bolingbroke was genius and\r\nforce without principle.  Ormond had principle without genius or force.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1715--Oxford committed to the Tower]\r\n\r\nTwo, then, of the great accused peers were beyond the reach of the\r\nHouse of Lords.  Oxford alone remained.  On July 9, 1715, articles of\r\nimpeachment were brought up against him.  The impeachment does not seem\r\nto have been very substantial in its character.  The great majority of\r\nits articles referred to the conduct of Oxford with regard to the\r\nTreaty of Utrecht.  One article accused him of having abused his\r\ninfluence over her Majesty by prevailing upon her to exercise \"in the\r\nmost unprecedented and dangerous manner\" her prerogative by the\r\ncreation of twelve Peers in December, 1711.  A motion that Oxford be\r\ncommitted to the Tower was made, and on this motion he spoke a few\r\nwords which were at once ingenious and dignified.  He asserted his\r\ninnocence of any treasonable practice or thought, and declared that\r\nwhat he had done was done in obedience to the positive orders of the\r\nQueen.  He asked the House what might not happen if Ministers of State,\r\nacting on the immediate commands of their sovereign, were afterwards to\r\nbe made accountable for their proceedings.  Then in a few words he\r\ncommended his cause to the justice of his brother peers, and took leave\r\nof the House of Lords, as he put it, \"perhaps forever.\"  Such an\r\nimpeachment would have been impossible in more recent days.  If Oxford\r\nhad been accused of treasonable dealings with the Stuarts, and if\r\nevidence could have been brought home to him, there indeed might have\r\nbeen a reasonable ground for impeachment.  But there was no sufficient\r\nevidence for any such purpose, and to impeach a statesman simply\r\nbecause he had taken a political course which was afterwards\r\ndisapproved by the nation, and which was discredited by results, was\r\nsimply to say that any failure in the policy of a Minister of the Crown\r\nmight make him liable to impeachment when his enemies came into power.\r\nThe Peace of Utrecht, bad as it was, had been condoned, or rather {113}\r\napproved of, by two successive Parliaments.  Shrewsbury, who was now in\r\nhigh favor, had been actively concerned in its promotion.  It was a\r\nquestion of compromise altogether, on which politicians were entitled\r\nto form the strongest opinions.  No doubt the enemies of the Tory party\r\nhad ample ground for condemning and denouncing the Peace.  But the part\r\nwhich a statesman had taken in bringing about the Peace could not,\r\naccording to our modern ideas, form any just ground of ministerial\r\nimpeachment.  Much more reasonably might the statesmen of a later day\r\nhave been impeached who, by their blundering and obstinacy, brought\r\nabout the armed resistance and the final independence of the North\r\nAmerican colonies.  It is curious, in our eyes, to find Oxford\r\ndefending his conduct on the ground that he had simply obeyed the\r\npositive orders of his sovereign.  The minister would run more risk of\r\nimpeachment, in our days, who declared that he had acted in some great\r\npublic crisis simply in obedience to his sovereign's orders, than if he\r\nwere to stand accountable for the greatest errors, the grossest\r\nblunders, committed on the judgment and on the responsibility of\r\nhimself and his colleagues.\r\n\r\nOxford was committed to the Tower, whither he went escorted by an\r\nimmense popular procession of his admirers, who cheered vociferously\r\nfor him and for High-Church together.  He may now be said to drop out\r\nof our history altogether.  He was destined to linger in long\r\nconfinement, almost like one forgotten by friends and enemies.  We\r\nshall have to tell afterwards how he petitioned for a trial, and was\r\nbrought to trial, and in what fashion he came to be acquitted by his\r\npeers.  The remainder of his life he passed in happy quietude among his\r\nbooks and curious manuscripts; the books and manuscripts which formed\r\nthe original stock of the Harleian Library, afterwards completed by his\r\nson.  Harley lived until 1724, and was not an old man even then--only\r\nsixty-three.  It is not necessary that in this work we should concern\r\nourselves much more about him.  Despite all the {114} praises of his\r\nfriends, some of them men of the highest intellectual gifts, like Swift\r\nand Pope, there does not seem to have been any great quality,\r\nintellectual or moral, in Harley.  He had a narrow and feeble mind; he\r\nwas incapable of taking a large view of anything; he was selfish and\r\ndeceitful; although it has to be said that sometimes that which men\r\ncalled deceit in him was but a lack of the capacity to look straight\r\nbefore him and make up his mind.  He often led astray those who acted\r\nwith him merely because his own confusion of intellect and want of\r\ndefined purpose were leading himself astray.  Perhaps the most\r\ndignified passage in his life was that which showed him calmly awaiting\r\nthe worst in London, when men like Bolingbroke and Ormond had chosen to\r\nseek safety in flight.  Yet even the course which he took in this\r\ninstance seems to have been rather the result of indecision than of\r\nindependent self-sufficing courage and resolve.  He does not appear to\r\nhave been able to decide upon anything until the time had passed when\r\nmovement of any kind would have availed, and so he remained where he\r\nwas.  Many a man has gained credit for courage, and has seemed to\r\nsurround himself with dignity, because at a moment of alarm, when\r\nothers did this or that, he was unable quite to make up his mind as to\r\nwhat he ought to do, and so did nothing, and let the world go by.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1715--Sir Henry St. John]\r\n\r\nOn September 17, Norroy, King at Arms, came solemnly down to the House\r\nof Lords and razed the names of Ormond and of Bolingbroke from the roll\r\nof peers.  Bolingbroke had some consolation of a sham kind.  He had\r\nwished and schemed to be Earl of Bolingbroke before his fall, and now\r\nhis new king, James of St. Germains, had given him the patent of\r\nenhanced nobility.  If he ceased to be a viscount in the eyes of\r\nEnglish peers and of English heralds, he was still an earl in the\r\nPretender's court.  Bolingbroke had too keen a sense of humor not to be\r\npainfully aware of the irony of the situation.  Nor was he likely to\r\nfind much satisfaction in the peerage {115} which the Government had\r\njust conferred upon his father, Sir Henry St. John, by creating him\r\nBaron of Battersea and Viscount St. John.  Sir Henry St. John was an\r\nidle, careless _roué_, a haunter of St. James's coffee-houses, living\r\nin the manner and in the memories of the Restoration, listlessly\r\nindifferent to all parties, leaning, perhaps, a little to the Whigs.\r\nHe had no manner of sympathy with his son or appreciation of his\r\ngenius.  When the son was made a peer the father only said, \"Well,\r\nHarry, I thought thee would be hanged, but now I see thee wilt be\r\nbeheaded.\"  The father himself was once very near being hanged.  In his\r\nwild youth he had killed a man in a quarrel, and was tried for murder\r\nand condemned to death, and then pardoned by the King, Charles II., in\r\nconsideration, it is said, of a liberal money-payment to the merry\r\nmonarch and his yet more merry mistresses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{116}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE COCKADE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1715--Bolingbroke at St. Germains]\r\n\r\nWhen Bolingbroke got to Paris he did not immediately attach himself to\r\nthe service of James.  Even then and there he still appears to have\r\nbeen undecided.  In the modern American phrase, he \"sat on the fence\"\r\nfor a while.  Probably, if he had seen even then a chance of returning\r\nwith safety to England, if the impeachments had not been going on, and\r\nif any manner of overture had been made to him from London, he would\r\nforthwith have dropped the Jacobite cause, and returned to profess his\r\nloyalty to the reigning English sovereign.  After a while, however,\r\nseeing that there was no chance for him at home, he went openly into\r\nthe cause of the Stuarts, and accepted the office of Secretary of State\r\nto James.  It must have been a trying position for a man of\r\nBolingbroke's genius and ambition when he found himself thus compelled\r\nto put up with an empty office at a sham court.  Bolingbroke's desire\r\nwas to play on a great stage, with a vast admiring audience.  He loved\r\nthe heat and passion of debate; he enjoyed his own rhetorical triumphs.\r\nHe must have been chilled and cramped indeed in a situation which\r\nallowed him no opportunity of displaying his most splendid and genuine\r\nqualities, while it constantly called on him for the exercise of the\r\nvery qualities which he had least at hand.  Nature had never meant him\r\nfor a conspirator, or even for a subtle political intriguer; nor,\r\nindeed, had Nature ever intended him to be the adherent of a lost\r\ncause.  All that could have made a position like his tolerable to a man\r\nof his peculiar capacity would have been faith in the cause--that faith\r\nwhich would have {117} prevented him from seeing any but its noble and\r\nexalted qualities, and would have made him forget himself in its hopes,\r\nits perils, its triumphs, and its disasters.  On the contrary, it would\r\nseem that Bolingbroke found it difficult to take the Stuart cause\r\nseriously, even when he was himself playing the part of its leading\r\nstatesman.  A critical observer writes from Paris in the early part of\r\nthe year 1716, saying that he believed Bolingbroke's chief fault was\r\n\"that he could not play his part with a grave enough face; he could not\r\nhelp laughing now and then at such kings and queens.\"  Meantime,\r\nBolingbroke amused himself in his moments of recreation after his old\r\nfashion, he indulged in amour after amour, intrigue after intrigue.\r\nLord Chesterfield said of him, that \"though nobody spoke and wrote\r\nbetter upon philosophy than Lord Bolingbroke, no man in the world had\r\nless share of philosophy than himself.  The least trifle, such as the\r\noverroasting of a leg of mutton, would strangely disturb and ruffle his\r\ntemper.\"  On the other hand, a glance from a pretty woman, or a glimpse\r\nof her ankle, would send all Bolingbroke's political combinations and\r\nphilosophical speculations flying into the air, and convert him in a\r\nmoment from the statesman or the philosopher into the merest _petit\r\nmaître_, macaroni, and gallant.\r\n\r\nLouis the Fourteenth refused to give open assistance to the cause of\r\nthe Stuarts, but he was willing enough to lend any help that he could\r\nin private to Bolingbroke and to them.  His death was the first severe\r\nblow to the cause which Bolingbroke now represented.  Louis the\r\nFourteenth was, according to Bolingbroke himself, the best friend James\r\nthen had.  \"When I engaged,\" says Bolingbroke, \"in this business, my\r\nprincipal dependence was on his personal character; my hopes sank as he\r\ndeclined, and died when he expired.\"  The Regent, Duke of Orleans, was\r\na man who, with all his coarse and unrestricted dissipation, had some\r\npolitical capacity and even statesmanship.  He saw that the Stuart was\r\na sinking, the Hanoverian a rising cause.  Even when the two seemed\r\n{118} most nearly balanced it yet appeared to Orleans, if we may quote\r\na phrase more often used in our days than in his, that the one cause\r\nwas only half alive, but the other was half dead.  Orleans, moreover,\r\nhad a good deal of that feeling which was more strongly marked still in\r\na Duke of Orleans of a later day.  He had a liking for England and for\r\nEnglish ways; he was, indeed, rather inclined to affect the political\r\nmanners of an English statesman.  He therefore leaned to the side of\r\nthe Government established in England; and, at the urgent request of\r\nthe English Ambassador in Paris, he acted with some energy in\r\npreventing the sailing of vessels intended for the uses of an\r\nexpedition to the English coast.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1715--\"Mischief, thou art afoot.\"]\r\n\r\nJames Stuart seemed as if he were determined still further to imperil\r\nthe chances of his family, and to embarrass his adherents.  The right\r\nmoment for a movement in his favor had been allowed to pass away, and\r\nnow, with characteristic blundering and ill fortune, he seized upon the\r\nmost unsuitable time that could possibly have been employed for such an\r\nattempt.  Something might have been done, perhaps, a temporary\r\nalteration in the dynasty might have been obtained, if energy and\r\ndecision had been shown in that momentous interval when Queen Anne lay\r\ndying.  But when that time had been allowed to pass, the clear policy\r\nof the Pretender was to permit the fears of Englishmen to go to sleep\r\nfor a while, to endeavor to reorganize his plans and his party; to wait\r\nuntil a certain reaction should set in, a reaction very likely to come\r\nabout because of the apparent incapacity and the unattractive character\r\nof George the First, and then at some timely hour, with well-matured\r\npreparations, to strike an energetic blow.  George the First was only a\r\nyear on the throne when the adherents of James got up a miserable\r\nattempt at an insurrection.\r\n\r\nThere were three conditions under which, and under which alone, an\r\ninsurrection just then would have had a reasonable chance of success.\r\nThese conditions were fully recognized and understood by the Jacobite\r\nleaders {119} in England, Scotland, and France.  The first was that a\r\nrising should take place at once in England and in Scotland, the second\r\nthat the Chevalier in person should take the field, and the third that\r\nFrance should give positive assistance to the enterprise.  The Jacobite\r\ncause was strong in the south-western counties of England, and there\r\nthe influence of the Duke of Ormond was strong likewise.  The general\r\narrangement, therefore, in the minds of the Jacobite chiefs was that\r\nJames Stuart should make his appearance in Scotland, that at the same\r\nmoment the Duke of Ormond should raise the standard of revolt in some\r\nof the south-western counties, and that France should assist the\r\nexpedition with men, money, and arms.  When James, acting against the\r\nadvice of his best counsellors, resolved on striking a blow at once,\r\ntwo of the necessary conditions were clearly wanting.  France was not\r\nwilling to give any actual assistance, and Ormond was not ready to\r\nraise the standard of rebellion in England.\r\n\r\nOrmond's sudden appearance in Paris struck dismay into the hearts of\r\nthe Jacobite counsellors, men and women, there.  It had been distinctly\r\nunderstood that he was to remain in England, and that, if threatened\r\nwith arrest, he was to hasten to one of the western counties, where he\r\nand his friends were strong, and strike a sudden blow.  He was to seize\r\nBristol, Exeter, Plymouth, and other towns, and set the Stuart flag\r\nflying all over that part of England.  When he appeared in France, a\r\nmere solitary fugitive, all men of sense saw that the game was up.\r\nBolingbroke at once sent through safe hands a clear statement of the\r\ncondition of things, to be laid before Lord Mar.  Bolingbroke's object\r\nwas to restrain Mar from any movement in the altered state of affairs.\r\nThe letter, however, came too late.  Mar had already made his movement\r\ntowards the Highlands: there was no stopping the enterprise then; the\r\nrebellion had taken fire.  James was determined more than ever to go.\r\nHis arguments were the arguments of mere desperation.  \"I cannot but\r\n{120} see,\" he wrote to Bolingbroke, \"that affairs grow daily worse and\r\nworse by delays, and that, as the business is now more difficult than\r\nit was six months ago, so these difficulties will, in all human\r\nappearance, rather increase than diminish.  Violent diseases must have\r\nviolent remedies, and to use none has, in some cases, the same effect\r\nas to use bad ones.\"  Indeed, it was impossible that the Chevalier\r\nhimself or the Duke of Ormond could hold back.  Both had personal\r\ncourage quite enough for such an attempt.  On the 28th of October James\r\nStuart, after many delays, set out in disguise, and travelled westward\r\nto St. Malo.  Ormond sailed from the coast of Normandy to that of\r\nDevonshire, but found there no sign of any arrangement for a rising.\r\nHis plans had long been known to the English Government, and measures\r\nhad been taken to frustrate them.  In that little Jacobite Parliament\r\nsitting in Paris, which Bolingbroke spoke of with such contempt, and\r\nfrom which, as he puts it, \"no sex was excluded,\" there was hardly any\r\nsecret made of the projects they were carrying on.  Before the sudden\r\nappearance of Ormond in Paris they had counted, with the utmost\r\nconfidence, on a full success, and were already talking of the\r\nRestoration as if it were an accomplished fact.  Every word they\r\nuttered which it was of the least importance for the British Government\r\nto hear was instantly made known to Lord Stair, the new English\r\nAmbassador--a resolute and capable man, a brilliant soldier, an astute\r\nand bold diplomatist, equal to any craft, ready for any emergency,\r\ncharming to all, dear to his friends, very formidable to his enemies.\r\nOrmond found that, as he had let the favorable moment slip when he fled\r\nfrom England to France, there was now no means whatever of recalling\r\nthe lost opportunity.  He returned to Brittany, and there he found the\r\nChevalier preparing to start for Scotland.  After various goings and\r\ncomings the Chevalier was at last enabled to embark at Dunkirk in a\r\nsmall vessel, with a few guns and half a dozen Jacobite officers to\r\nattend him, and he made for the Scottish coast.\r\n\r\n{121}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1715--The camp in Hyde Park]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, and as if in obedience to some word of command\r\nfrom France, there was a general and almost simultaneous outburst of\r\nJacobite demonstration in England, amounting in most places to riot.\r\nIn London, and all over England, so far as one can judge, the popular\r\nfeeling appears to have been rather with the Jacobites than against\r\nthem.  Stout Jacobites toasted a mysterious person called Job, who had\r\nno connection with the prophet, but whose name contained the initial\r\nletters of James, Ormond, and Bolingbroke; and \"Kit\" was no less\r\npopular, because it stood for \"King James III.,\" while the mysterious\r\nsymbolism of the \"Three B's\" implied \"Best Born Briton,\" and so the\r\nChevalier de St. George.  The Chevalier's birthday--the 10th of\r\nJune--was celebrated with wild outbursts of enthusiasm in several\r\nplaces.  Stuart-loving Oxford in especial made a brave show of its\r\nwhite roses.  The Loyalists, who endeavored to do a similar honor to\r\nthe birthday of King George, were often violently assailed by mobs.  In\r\nmany places the windows of houses whose inmates refused to illuminate\r\nin honor of the Chevalier were broken; William the Third was burned in\r\neffigy in various parts of London, and in many towns throughout the\r\ncountry.  So serious at one period did the revulsion of Jacobite\r\nfeeling appear to be, that it was thought necessary to form a camp in\r\nHyde Park, and to bring together a large body of troops there.  The\r\nLife Guards and Horse Grenadiers, three battalions of the Foot Guards,\r\nthe Duke of Argyll's regiment, and several pieces of cannon were\r\nestablished in the camp.  By a curious coincidence the troops were\r\nreviewed by King George, the Prince of Wales, and the Duke of\r\nMarlborough, on the 25th of August, 1715, the very day on which, as we\r\nshall presently see, the Highland clans set up the standard of the\r\nStuarts at Braemar, in Scotland.  The camp had a certain amount of\r\npractical advantage in it, independently of its supposed political\r\nnecessity--it made Hyde Park safe at night.  Before the camp was\r\nestablished, and after it was broken up, the Park appears to {122} have\r\nbeen little better than Bagshot Heath or Hounslow Heath.  It was the\r\nfavorite parade-ground of highway robbers and murderers.  The soldiers\r\nthemselves were occasionally suspected of playing the part of\r\nhighwaymen.  \"A man in those days,\" says Scott, \"might have all the\r\nexternal appearance of a gentleman, and yet turn out to be a\r\nhighwayman;\" and \"the profession of the polite and accomplished\r\nadventurer who nicked you out of your money at White's, or bowled you\r\nout of it at Marylebone, was often united with that of the professed\r\nruffian who, on Bagshot Heath or Finchley Common, commanded his brother\r\nbeau to stand and deliver.\"  \"Robbers--a fertile and alarming\r\ntheme--filled up every vacancy, and the names of the Golden Farmer, the\r\nFlying Highwayman, Jack Needham, and other Beggars' Opera heroes, were\r\nfamiliar in our mouths as household words.\"  The revulsion of Jacobite\r\nfeeling actually showed itself sometimes among the soldiers in the\r\ncamp.  Accounts published at the time tell us of men having been\r\nflogged and shot for wearing Jacobite emblems in their caps.  Perhaps\r\nin mentioning this Hyde Park camp it may not be inappropriate to notice\r\nthe fact that General Macartney, who had figured in a terrible tragedy\r\nin the Park two or three years before, returned to England, and\r\nobtained the favor of George by bringing over six thousand soldiers\r\nfrom Holland to assist the King.  General Macartney was the man who had\r\nacted as second to Lord Mohun in the fatal duel in Hyde Park on the\r\n15th of November, 1712, when both Mohun and the Duke of Hamilton were\r\nkilled.  Macartney escaped to Holland, and was charged by the Duke of\r\nHamilton's second with having stabbed the Duke through the heart while\r\nColonel Hamilton was endeavoring to raise him from the ground.\r\nMacartney came back and took his trial, but was only found guilty of\r\nmanslaughter--that is to say, found guilty of having taken part in the\r\nduel, and escaped without punishment.  Probably Macartney, and\r\nHamilton, and Mohun, and the Duke are best remembered in our time\r\nbecause of the {123} effect which that fatal meeting had upon the\r\nfortunes of Beatrix Esmond.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1715--John Erskine of Mar]\r\n\r\nThe insurrection had already broken out in Scotland.  John Erskine,\r\neleventh Earl of Mar, set himself up as lieutenant-general in the cause\r\nof the Chevalier.  Lord Mar was a man of much courage and some\r\ncapacity.  He had held high office under Queen Anne.  One of the\r\nbiographers of that period describes Mar as a devoted adherent of the\r\nStuarts.  His career is indeed a fair illustration of the sort of thing\r\nwhich then sometimes passed for devoted adherence to a cause.  When\r\nKing George reached England he dismissed Mar from office, suspecting\r\nhim of sympathy with the Jacobite movement.  Mar had expected something\r\nof the kind, and had written an obsequious and a grovelling letter to\r\nGeorge, in which he spoke of the king's \"happy accession,\" professed\r\nunbounded devotion to the house of Hanover, and promised that \"You\r\nshall ever find in me as faithful a subject as ever any king had.\"  The\r\nnew king, however, declined to trust to the faithfulness of this\r\nsubject; and a year after the faithful subject had returned to his\r\nJacobite convictions, and was gathering the Highland clans in James\r\nStuart's name.\r\n\r\nThe clans were got together at Braemar.  The white cockade was mounted\r\nthere by clan after clan, the Macintoshes being the first to display it\r\nas the emblem of the Stuart cause.  Inverness was seized.  King James\r\nwas proclaimed at several places, notably at Dundee, by Graham, the\r\nbrother of \"conquering Graham,\" Bonnie Dundee, the fearless, cruel,\r\nclever Claverhouse who fell at Killiecrankie.  Perth was secured.  The\r\nforce under Mar's leadership grow greater every day.  He had begun with\r\na handful of men.  He had now a little army.  He had set up his\r\nstandard almost at hap-hazard at Braemar, and now nearly all the\r\ncountry north of the Tay was in the hands of the Jacobites.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Argyll was put in command of the royal forces, and arrived\r\nin Scotland in the middle of September 1716.  He hastened to the camp,\r\nwhich had been got {124} together somehow at Stirling.  He came there\r\nalmost literally alone.  He brought no soldiers with him.  He found few\r\nsoldiers there to receive him.  Under his command he had altogether\r\nabout a thousand foot and half as many dragoons, the latter consisting\r\nin great measure of the famous and excellent Scots Grays.  His prospect\r\nlooked indeed very doubtful.  He could expect little or no assistance\r\nfrom his own clan.  They had work enough to do in guarding against a\r\npossible attack from some of the followers of Lord Mar.  Glasgow,\r\nDumfries, and other towns were likewise in imminent danger from some of\r\nthe Highland clans, and were kept in a continual agony of apprehension.\r\nIt seemed likely enough that Argyll might soon be surrounded at\r\nStirling.  If Mar had only made a forward movement it is impossible to\r\nsay what degree of success he might not have accomplished.  It seems\r\nalmost marvellous, when we look back and survey the state of things, to\r\nsee what a miserable force the Government had to rely upon.  In the\r\nwhole country they had only about eight thousand men.  They had more\r\nmen abroad than at home, and in the critical condition of things which\r\nstill prevailed upon the Continent, it did not seem clear that they\r\ncould, except in the very last extremity, bring home many of the men\r\nwhom they kept abroad.  Of that little force of eight thousand soldiers\r\nthey did not venture to send a considerable proportion up to the North.\r\nThey had, perhaps, good reason.  They did not know yet where the\r\nserious blow was to be struck for the Stuart cause.  Many of George's\r\ncounsellors still looked upon the movement in Scotland as something\r\nmerely in the nature of a feint.  They believed that the real blow\r\nwould yet be struck by Ormond in the West of England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1715--Sheriffmuir]\r\n\r\nBut the evil fortune which hung over the Stuart cause in all its later\r\ndays clung to it now.  There was no conceivable reason why Mar should\r\nnot have marched southward.  The forces of the King were few in number,\r\nand were not well placed for the purpose of making any considerable\r\nresistance.  But in an enterprise like that of {125} Mar all depends\r\nupon rapidity of movement.  What we may call the ultimate resources of\r\nthe country were in the hands of the King and his adherents.  Every\r\nday's delay enabled them to grow stronger.  Every day's delay beyond a\r\ncertain time discouraged and weakened the invaders.  Mar might, at one\r\ncritical moment, have swept Argyll's exhausted troops before him, but\r\nhe was feeble and timorous; he dallied; he let the time pass; he\r\nallowed Argyll to get away without making an effort to attack him.  It\r\nwas then that one of the Gordon clan broke into that memorable\r\nexclamation, \"Oh for one hour of Dundee!\"--the exclamation which Byron\r\nhas paraphrased in the line,\r\n\r\n  Oh, for one hour of blind old Dandolo!\r\n\r\n\r\nCertainly one hour of Dundee might, at more than one crisis in this\r\nmelancholy struggle, have secured for the time the cause of the\r\nStuarts, and won for James at least a temporary occupation of the\r\nthrone of his ancestors.  Mar's little force remained motionless long\r\nenough to allow the Duke of Argyll to get sufficient strength to make\r\nan attack upon it at Sheriffmuir.  Sheriffmuir was not much of a\r\nvictory.  Each side, in fact, claimed the conqueror's honor.  Mar was\r\nnot annihilated, nor Argyll driven back.  The Duke of Argyll probably\r\nlost more of his men, but, on the other hand, he captured many guns and\r\nstandards, and he re-appeared on the same field the next day, while Mar\r\nshowed there no more.  Tested in the only practical way, it is clear\r\nthat the Duke of Argyll had the better of it.  Lord Mar wanted to do\r\nsomething, and was prevented from doing it at a time when to him\r\neverything depended on advance and on success.  The Duke of Argyll\r\nsuccessfully interposed between Mar and his object, and therefore was\r\nclearly the victor.\r\n\r\nIt is on record that no small share of Mar's ill-success was due to the\r\naction, or rather the inaction, of the famous Highland outlaw, Rob Roy.\r\nHe and his clan had joined Mar's standard, but his sympathies seem to\r\nhave been with Argyll.  He had an unusually large body of {126} men\r\nunder his command, for many of the clan Macpherson had been committed\r\nto his leadership, in consequence of the old age of their chief; but at\r\na critical moment he refused to lead his men to the charge, and stood\r\non a hill with his followers unconcernedly surveying the fight.  It is\r\nsaid that had he kept faith he could have turned the fortunes of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1715--\"If he will die like a prince\"]\r\n\r\nArgyll and the cause he represented could afford to wait, and Mar could\r\nnot.  The insurrection already began to melt.  James Stuart himself\r\nmade his appearance in Scotland.  He was characteristically late for\r\nSheriffmuir, and when he did throw himself into the field he seemed\r\nunable to take any decisive step, or even to come to any clear\r\ndecision.  He did not succeed in making himself popular, even for the\r\nmoment, among his followers in Scotland.  The occasion was one in which\r\ngallant bearing and kingly demeanor would have gone for much, and\r\nindeed it is not at all impossible that a leader of a different stamp\r\nfrom James might even then have so inspired the Highland clansmen, and\r\nso made use of his opportunity, as to overwhelm Argyll and the\r\nHanoverian forces, and turn the whole crisis to his favor.  But James\r\nwas peculiarly unsuited to an enterprise of the kind.  He had graceful\r\nmanners, a mild, serene temper, and great power of application to work.\r\nHis personal courage was undoubted, and he was willing enough to risk\r\nhis own life on any chance; but he had none of the spirit of a\r\ncommander.  He was sometimes weak and sometimes obstinate.  His very\r\nappearance was not in his favor among the Highland men, to whom he had\r\npreviously been unknown.  He was tall and thin, with pale face, and\r\neyes that wanted fire and expression.  His words were few, his behavior\r\nalways sedate and somewhat depressed.  Here, among the Scottish\r\nclansmen on the verge of rebellion, he seemed utterly borne down by the\r\ngreatness of the enterprise.  He was wholly unable to infuse anything\r\nlike spirit or hope into his followers.  On the contrary, his\r\nappearance among them, when he did show {127} himself, had a\r\ndispiriting and a depressing effect on almost every mind.  Those who\r\nremember the manner and demeanor of the late Louis Napoleon, Emperor of\r\nthe French, the silent shyness, the appearance of almost constant\r\ndepression, which were characteristic of that sovereign, will, we\r\nthink, be easily able to form a clear idea of the effect that James\r\nStuart produced among his followers in Scotland.  He did not care to\r\nsee the soldiers exercise, and handle their arms; he avoided going\r\namong them as much as possible.  The men at last began to feel a\r\nmistrust of his courage--the one great quality which he certainly did\r\nnot lack.  A feeling of something like contempt began to spread abroad.\r\n\"Can he speak at all?\" some of the soldiers asked.  He was all ice; his\r\nvery kindness was freezing.  A man like Dundee called to such an\r\nenterprise would have set the clans of Scotland aflame with enthusiasm.\r\nJames Stuart was only a chilling and a dissolving influence.  His more\r\nimmediate military counsellors were like himself, and their only policy\r\nseemed to be one of postponement and delay.  They advised him against\r\naction of every kind.  The clansmen grew impatient.  At Perth, one\r\ndevoted Highland chief actually suggested that James should be taken\r\naway by force from his advisers, and brought among men who were ready\r\nto fight.  \"If he is willing to die like a prince,\" said this man, \"he\r\nwill find there are ten thousand gentlemen in Scotland who are willing\r\nto die with him.\"  If James had followed the bent of his own\r\ndisposition, he might even then have died like a prince, or gone on to\r\na throne.  His opponents were as little inclined for action as his own\r\nimmediate advisers.  The Duke of Argyll himself delayed making an\r\nadvance until peremptory orders were sent to him from London.  So long,\r\nand with so little excuse, did he delay, that statesmen in London\r\nsuspected, not unreasonably, that Argyll was still willing to give\r\nJames Stuart a chance, or was not yet quite certain whether the cause\r\nof the Stuarts was wholly lost.  It is characteristic of the time that\r\nso long as there seemed any possibility of James {128} redeeming his\r\ncrown Argyll's own colleagues suspected that Argyll was not willing to\r\nput himself personally in the way.  At last, however, the peremptory\r\norder came that Argyll must advance upon Perth.  The moment the advance\r\nbecame apparent, the counsellors of James Stuart insisted on a retreat.\r\nOn a day of ill omen to the Stuart cause, the 30th of January, 1716,\r\nthe anniversary of the day when Charles the First was executed, the\r\nretreat from Perth was resolved on.  That retreat was the end of the\r\nenterprise.  Many Jacobites had already made up their minds that the\r\nstruggle was over, that there was nothing better to be done than to\r\ndisperse before the advancing troops of King George, that the sooner\r\nthe forces of James Stuart melted away, and James Stuart himself got\r\nback to France, the better.  James Stuart went back to France, and the\r\nclansmen returned to their homes.  Some of the Roman Catholic gentlemen\r\nrose in Northumberland, and endeavored to form a junction with a\r\nportion of Mar's force which had come southward to meet them.  The\r\nEnglish Jacobites, however, were defeated at Preston, and compelled to\r\nsurrender.  After a voyage of five days in a small vessel, James\r\nsucceeded in reaching Gravelines safely on the 8th of February, 1716.\r\nHis whole expedition had not occupied him more than six weeks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1715--Marlborough's counsels]\r\n\r\nIt was believed at the time that the counsels of the Duke of\r\nMarlborough were mainly instrumental in bringing about the prompt\r\nsuppression of the rebellion.  Marlborough's advice was asked with\r\nregard to the military movements and dispositions to be made, and the\r\nbelief of the day was that it was his counsel, and the manner in which\r\nthe Government followed it out, which led to the utter overthrow of\r\nJames Stuart and the dispersion of his followers.  Marlborough is said\r\nto have actually told in advance the very time at which, if his advice\r\nwere followed, the rebellion could be put down.  Nothing is more likely\r\nthan that Marlborough's advice should have been sought and should have\r\nbeen given.  It would not in the {129} least degree militate against\r\nthe truth of the story that the outbreak took place so soon after\r\nMarlborough had been professing the most devoted attachment to the\r\ncause of the Stuarts, and had declared, as we have said already, that\r\nhe would rather cut off his right hand than do anything to injure the\r\nclaims of the Chevalier St. George.  But it would not seem that any\r\nadvice Marlborough might have given was followed out very strictly in\r\nthe measures taken to put down the rebellion.  We may be sure that\r\nMarlborough's would have been military counsel worthy of the greatest\r\ncommander of his age.  But in the measures taken to put down the\r\nrebellion we can see nothing but incapacity, vacillation, and even\r\ntimidity.  An energetic man in Argyll's position, seeing how James\r\nStuart halted and fluctuated, must have made up his mind at once that a\r\nrapid and bold movement would finish the rebellion, and we find no such\r\nmovement made, until at last the most peremptory orders from London\r\ncompelled Argyll at all hazards to advance.  If then Marlborough gave\r\nhis advice in London, which is very likely, it would seem that, for\r\nsome reason or other, the advice was not followed by the commanders in\r\nthe field.  The whole story reminds one of the belief long entertained\r\nin France, and which we suppose has some votaries there still, that the\r\ngreat success of the Duke of Wellington, in the latter part of the war\r\nagainst Napoleon, was due to the military counsels of Dumouriez, then\r\nan exile in London.\r\n\r\nThere was a plan for the capture of Edinburgh Castle, which, like other\r\nStuart enterprises, would have been a great thing if it had only\r\nsucceeded.  Edinburgh Castle was then full of arms, stores, and money.\r\nSome eighty of the Jacobites, chiefly Highlanders, contrived a\r\nwell-laid scheme by which to get possession of the Castle.  They\r\nmanaged by bribes and promises to win over three soldiers in the Castle\r\nitself.  The arrangement was that these men were to be furnished with\r\nladders of a peculiar construction suited to the purpose, which, at a\r\ncertain hour of the night, they were to lower down the Castle rock on\r\nthe {130} north side--the side looking on the Prince Street of our day.\r\nBy these ladders the assailants were quietly to ascend, and then\r\noverpower the little garrison, and possess themselves of the Castle.\r\nWhen the stroke had been done, they were to fire three cannon, and men\r\nstationed on the opposite coast of Fife were thereupon to light a\r\nbeacon; and the flash of that light would be the signal for other\r\nbeacons from hill to hill to bear the news to Mar--as the lights along\r\nthe Argive hills carried the tale of Troy's fall to Argos.  The plan\r\nwas an utter failure.  It broke down in two places.  One of the\r\nconspirators told his brother; the brother told his wife; the lady took\r\nalarm, and sent an anonymous letter disclosing the whole plot to the\r\nLord Justice Clerk.  Yet even then, had the conspirators been in time,\r\ntheir plan might have succeeded; for the anonymous letter did not reach\r\nits destination till an hour after the time appointed to make the\r\nattempt on the Castle.  But the conspirators were not punctual.  Some\r\nof them were in a tavern in Edinburgh, drinking to the success of their\r\nenterprise.  Every one in the neighborhood seems to have known what\r\ntheir enterprise was, to have had some sympathy with it, to have talked\r\nfreely about it.  Eighteen of these heroes kept up their conviviality\r\nin the tavern till long after the appointed time.  The hostess of the\r\nplace was heard to say that they were powdering their hair to go to the\r\nattack on the Castle.  \"A strange sort of powder,\" Lord Stanhope\r\nremarks, \"to provide on such an occasion.\"  Lord Stanhope evidently\r\ntakes the hostess's words in a literal sense, and believes that the\r\nlady really meant to say that the jovial conspirators were actually\r\npowdering their locks as if for a ball.  We may assume that the hostess\r\nspoke as Hamlet did, \"tropically.\"  Whether she did or not--whether\r\nthey were really adorning their locks, or simply draining the\r\nflagon--the result was all the same.  They came too late; the plot was\r\ndiscovered; the sympathizing soldiers from the Castle were already\r\nunder arrest.  The conspirators had to disperse and fly; a few of them\r\nwere arrested; {131} their neighbors were only too willing to help them\r\nto escape.  It cannot be doubted that there was sympathy enough in\r\nEdinburgh to have made their plan the beginning of a complete\r\nsuccess--if it had only itself been allowed to succeed.  But the\r\ndisclosure to the lady, and the powder for the hair, brought all to\r\nnothing.  The whole story might almost be said to be an allegorical\r\nillustration of the fortunes of the Stuarts.  The pint and the\r\npetticoat always came in the way of a success to that cause.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1715--Bolingbroke's dismissal]\r\n\r\nWhen James reached Gravelines, he hurried on to St. Germains.  There,\r\nthe next morning, Bolingbroke came to see him.  Bolingbroke, to do him\r\njustice, had done all in his power to dissuade James from making his\r\nfatal expedition at such a time, and under such untoward circumstances.\r\nHe had shown judgment, prudence, and, in the true sense, courage.  He\r\nhad shown himself a statesman.  He might very well have met James in\r\nthe mood and with the remonstrances of the counsellors who, after the\r\nevent, are able to say, \"I told you so.\"  But Bolingbroke appears to\r\nhave had more discretion and more manliness.  He advised James to\r\nwithdraw once again from the dominions of the King, and take refuge in\r\nLorraine.  Bolingbroke knew well, by this time, that there was not the\r\nslightest chance of any open assistance from the French Court; and even\r\nthat the French Court would be only too ready to throw James over, and\r\nsacrifice him, if, by doing so, they could strengthen the bonds of good\r\nfeeling between France and England.  James professed to take\r\nBolingbroke's counsel in very friendly fashion, and parted from\r\nBolingbroke with many expressions of confidence and affection.  Yet it\r\nis certain that at this time he had made up his mind not to see\r\nBolingbroke any more.  He went for a time to a house near Versailles, a\r\nkind of headquarters of intriguing political women, and thence\r\nimmediately despatched a letter to Bolingbroke, relieving him of all\r\nhis duties as Secretary of State.  Bolingbroke affects to have taken\r\nhis dismissal very composedly, but it cannot be doubted that his heart\r\nburned within him at what he, {132} doubtless, believed to be the\r\ningratitude of the prince for whom he had done and sacrificed so much.\r\nFor Bolingbroke had that unlucky gift of fancy which enables a man to\r\nsee himself, and his own doings, and his own merits, in whatever light\r\nis most gratifying to his personal vanity.  He had, in truth, never\r\nrisked nor sacrificed anything for the sake of James or the Stuart\r\ncause.  He never had the least idea of risking or sacrificing anything\r\nfor that cause, or for any other.  It was only when his fortunes in\r\nEngland became desperate, when impeachment, and, as he believed, a\r\nscaffold threatened him, when he had no apparent alternative left but\r\nto join the Pretender or stay at home and lose all--it was only then\r\nthat he took any decided step as an adherent of the cause of the\r\nStuarts.  We cannot doubt that James Stuart knew to the full the part\r\nthat Bolingbroke had played.  He knew that he owed Bolingbroke no\r\nfavor, and that he could have no confidence in him.  Still, it remains\r\nto the present hour a mystery why James should then, and in that\r\nmanner, have got rid of Bolingbroke forever.  Bolingbroke himself does\r\nnot appear to have known the cause of his dismissal.  It may be that\r\nJames had grown tired of the whole fruitless struggle, and was glad to\r\nget rid of a minister whose restless energy and genius would always\r\nhave kept political intrigue alive, and political enterprises going.\r\nOr it may be that just then there had fallen into James's hands some\r\nnew and recent evidences of Bolingbroke's willingness to treat, on\r\noccasion, with either side.  However this may be, James made up his\r\nmind to dismiss his great follower, and Bolingbroke at once made up his\r\nmind to endeavor to ingratiate himself into the favor of the House of\r\nHanover, and to secure his restoration to London society.  Almost at\r\nthe very moment of his dismissal he made application to some of his\r\nfriends in London to endeavor to obtain for him a permission to return.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1715--\"Banished Bolingbroke repeats himself\"]\r\n\r\nWe do not absolutely say a farewell to Bolingbroke now and here, as he\r\nstands dismissed from the service of {133} the Stuarts and disqualified\r\nfor the service of the Hanoverians.  Nearly forty years of life were\r\nyet before him, but his work as a statesman was done.  Never again had\r\nhis genius a chance of shining in the service of a throne.  The\r\nmaster-politician of the age was out of employment forever.  We do not\r\nknow if history anywhere supplies such another example of a great\r\npolitical career snapped off so suddenly at its midst, hardly even at\r\nits midst, and never put together again.  Bolingbroke re-appeared again\r\nand again in England.  He even took more than once a certain kind of\r\npart in politics--that is in pamphleteering; he tried to be the\r\ninspiration and the guiding-star of Pulteney and other rising men who\r\nhad come, for one reason or another, to detest Walpole.  But even these\r\nsoon began to find Bolingbroke rather more of a hinderance than a help,\r\nand were glad to shake him off and be rid of him.  He becomes\r\neverything by turns; plays at cool philosophy and philosophic retreat;\r\nis always assuring the world in tones of highly suspicious eagerness\r\nthat he is done forever with it and its works and pomps; and he is\r\nalways yearning and striving to get back to the works and pomps again.\r\nHe plays at farming, actually puts on countrified manners, and dines\r\nostentatiously off homely farmer-like fare, to the amusement of some of\r\nhis friends.  He undertakes to settle the whole question of religion,\r\nof this world and the next, including the entire code of human ethics;\r\nand at the same time he is very fond of expatiating to young men\r\nconcerning the most effective ways for the seduction of women, the\r\ncourse to be followed with a lady of quality, the different course in\r\ndealing with an actress, the policy of a long siege, and the policy of\r\nan attack by storm.  He marries again and gets money with his wife, a\r\nFrench _marquise_, once beautiful, somewhat older than himself, and\r\nseems to be fond of her and happy with her, and discourses to her as to\r\nothers about the variety of his successful amours.  Through long, long\r\nyears his shadow, his ghost, for in the political sense it is {134}\r\nnothing else, keeps revisiting the glimpses of the moon in England.\r\nFor all the influence he is destined to have on the realities of\r\npolitical life, he might as well be already lying in that tomb in the\r\nold church on the edge of the Thames at Battersea where his strangely\r\nbrilliant, strangely blighted career is to come to an end at last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{135}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nAFTER THE REBELLION.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1715--Conflicts of parties]\r\n\r\nAll this time the Jacobite demonstrations were still going on in London\r\nand in various parts of England with as much energy as ever.  Green\r\nboughs and oak apples were worn, and even flaunted, about the streets, by\r\ngroups of persons on May 29th, the anniversary of Charles the Second's\r\nrestoration.  We read of the riots in London, of Whigs of the \"Loyal\r\nSociety\" going about with little warming-pans as emblems of their\r\nhostility to the Stuart cause, and being met by other mobs bearing white\r\nroses as badges of the Stuart cause.  There was a continual battle of\r\npamphleteers and of ballad-writers.  \"High-Church and Ormond!\" were\r\nshouted for and sung on one side of the political field, and the \"Pope\r\nand Perkin,\" that is to say, James Stuart, were as liberally denounced on\r\nthe other.  The scandals about King George's mistresses were freely\r\nalluded to in the Jacobite songs.  The public of all parties seem to have\r\nvery cordially detested the ill-favored ladies whom George had brought\r\nover from Hanover.  The coarsest and grossest abuse was poured forth in\r\nballads and in pamphlets against the King's favorites and courtiers, and\r\nwas sung and shouted day and night in the public streets.\r\n\r\nThen, and for long after, these public streets were battle-grounds on\r\nwhich Whigs and Tories, Hanoverians and Jacobites, fought out their\r\nquarrel.  Men carried turnips in their hats in mockery of the German\r\nelector who had threatened to make St. James's Park a turnip-field, and\r\nwere prepared to fight lustily for their bucolic emblem.  Women fanned\r\nthe strife, wore white roses for the King {136} over the water, or Sweet\r\nWilliam in compliment to the \"immortal memory\" of William of Nassau.\r\nSometimes even women were roughly treated.  On one occasion we read of a\r\nserving-girl, who had made known the hiding-place of a Jacobite, being\r\nattacked and nearly murdered by a Jacobite mob, and rescued by some Whig\r\ngentlemen.  On another occasion a Whig gentleman seeing a young lady in\r\nthe street with a white rose in her bosom, jumped from his coach, tore\r\nout the disloyal blossom, lashed the young lady with his whip, and handed\r\nher over to a gang of Whigs, who would have stripped and scourged her but\r\nfor the timely appearance of some Jacobite gentry, by whom she was\r\ncarried home in safety.  The \"Flying Post\" warns all \"he-Jacobites\" and\r\n\"she-Jacobites\" that if they are not careful they will meet with more\r\nsevere treatment than hitherto, and then alludes to some pretty severe\r\ntreatment the poor \"she-Jacobites\" had already received.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1715--\"All for our rightful King\"]\r\n\r\nTo do the King and his family justice, they behaved with courage and\r\ncomposure through this long season of popular excitement.  They went\r\neverywhere as they pleased, braving the dangers that certainly existed.\r\nOnce a man named Moor spat in the face of the Princess of Wales as she\r\nwas going through the streets, and he was scourged till he cried \"God\r\nbless King George!\"  In 1718 a youth named Sheppard was hanged for\r\nplanning King George's death.  This led a Hanoverian fanatic named Bowes\r\nto suggest to the ministry that in return he should go to Italy and kill\r\nKing James.  His proffer of political retaliation only resulted in his\r\nbeing shut up as a madman.  At last the temper of the times and the\r\nfrequent threats of assassination compelled the King to take more care of\r\nhimself.  Though he walked in Kensington Gardens every day, the gardens\r\nwere first searched, and then carefully watched by soldiers.\r\n\r\nWhen the rebellion was over, the Government found they had a large number\r\nof prisoners on their hands, many of them of high rank.  Several officers\r\ntaken on {137} the field had already been treated as deserters and shot,\r\nafter a trial by drum-head court-martial.  Some of the prisoners of\r\nhigher rank were brought into London in a manner like that of captives\r\ndragged along in an old Roman triumph, or like that of actual convicts\r\ntaken to Tyburn.  They were marched in procession from Highgate through\r\nLondon, each man sitting on a horse, having his arms tied with cords\r\nbehind his back, the horses led by soldiers, with a military escort\r\ndrumming and fifing a march of triumph.  The men of noble rank were\r\nconfined in the Tower; others, many of them men of position, such as Mr.\r\nThomas Forster, a Northumberland gentleman, and member for his county,\r\nwere thrust into Newgate, whose horrors have been so well described in\r\nScott's \"Rob Roy.\"  The Rev. Robert Patten, who had been a conspicuous\r\nJacobite, played a Titus Oates part in betraying his companions, and his\r\nname figures for King's evidence incessantly in the political trials.\r\nWhen he tired of treachery he retired to the obscurity of his parish of\r\nAllendale, in Northumberland, and gave the world his history of the\r\nrebellion in which he had played so base a part.\r\n\r\nAmong the chief prisoners were Lord Widdrington, the Earl of Nithisdale,\r\nthe Earl of Wintoun, the Earl of Carnwath, the Earl of Derwentwater,\r\nViscount Kenmure, and Lord Nairn.  These noblemen were impeached before\r\nthe House of Lords, and all, except Lord Wintoun, pleaded guilty, and\r\nprayed for the mercy of the King.  Every effort was made to obtain a\r\npardon for some of the condemned noblemen.  Women of rank and beauty\r\nimplored the King's mercy.  Audacious attempts were made to bribe the\r\nministers.  Some eminent members of the Whig party in the House of\r\nCommons spoke up manfully and courageously in favor of a policy of mercy.\r\nIt is something pleasant to recollect that Sir Richard Steele, who had\r\ngot into Parliament again, was conspicuous among these.  In the House of\r\nLords the friends of the condemned men succeeded in carrying, despite the\r\nstrong {138} resistance of the Government, a motion for an address to the\r\nKing, beseeching him to extend mercy to the noblemen in prison.  Walpole\r\nhimself had spoken very harshly in the House of Commons, and condemned in\r\nunmeasured terms those of his party--the Whig party--who could be so\r\nunworthy as, without blushing, to open their mouths in favor of rebels\r\nand parricides, and he had carried an adjournment of the House of Commons\r\nfrom the 22d of February to the 1st of March, in order to prevent any\r\nfurther petitions in favor of the rebel lords from being presented before\r\nthe day fixed for their execution.  One of these petitions, it is worth\r\nwhile recollecting, was presented by the kindly hand and supported by the\r\nmanly voice of Sir Richard Steele.  The ministers returned a merely\r\nformal answer on the King's behalf to the address, but they thought it\r\nwise to recommend a respite to be given to Lord Nairn, the Earl of\r\nCarnwath, and Lord Widdrington; and in order to get rid of any further\r\nappeals for mercy, they resolved that the execution of Lord Nithisdale,\r\nLord Derwentwater, and Lord Kenmure should take place the very next day.\r\nLord Nithisdale, however, was lucky enough to make his escape, somewhat\r\nafter the fashion in which Lavalette, at a much later date, contrived to\r\nget out of prison, by the courage, devotion, and ingenuity of his wife.\r\nIt is a curious fact that most of the contemporaries of Nithisdale who\r\ntell the story of his escape have represented his mother, and not his\r\nwife, as the woman who took his place in prison, and to whose energy and\r\nadroitness he owed his life.  Smollett is one of those who give this\r\nversion as if there were no doubt about it.  Lord Stanhope, in the first\r\nedition of his \"History of England, from the Peace of Utrecht to the\r\nPeace of Versailles,\" accepted the story on authorities which seemed so\r\ntrustworthy.  Lord Stanhope knew that many modern writers had described\r\nthe escape as being effected by Lord Nithisdale's wife, but he assumed\r\nthat \"the name of the wife was substituted in later tradition as being\r\nmore romantic.\"  A letter from Lady Nithisdale herself, {139} written to\r\nher sister, settles the whole question, and of course Lord Stanhope\r\nimmediately adopted this genuine version.  Lady Nithisdale tells how at\r\nfirst she endeavored to present a petition to the King.  The first day\r\nshe heard that the King was to go to the drawing-room, she dressed\r\nherself in black, as if in mourning, and had a lady to accompany her,\r\nbecause she did not know the King personally, and might have mistaken\r\nsome other man for him.  This lady and another came with her, and the\r\nthree remained in the room between the King's apartments and the\r\ndrawing-room.  When George was passing through, \"I threw myself at his\r\nfeet, and told him in French that I was the unfortunate Countess of\r\nNithisdale. . . .  Perceiving that he wanted to go off without receiving\r\nmy petition, I caught hold of the skirt of his coat that he might stop\r\nand hear me.  He endeavored to escape out of my hands, but I kept such\r\nstrong hold that he dragged me upon my knees from the middle of the room\r\nto the very door of the drawing-room.\"  One of the attendants of the King\r\ncaught the unfortunate lady round the waist, while another dragged the\r\nKing's coat-skirt out of her hands.  \"The petition, which I had\r\nendeavored to thrust into his pocket, fell down in the scuffle, and I\r\nalmost fainted away through grief and disappointment.\"  Seldom, perhaps,\r\nin the history of royalty is there a description of so ungracious,\r\nunkingly, and even brutal reception of a petition presented by a\r\ndistracted wife praying for a pardon to her husband.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1716--This most constant wife]\r\n\r\nThen Lady Nithisdale determined to effect her husband's escape.  She\r\ncommunicated her design to a Mrs. Mills, and took another lady with her\r\nalso.  This lady was of tall and slender make, and she carried under her\r\nown riding-hood one that Lady Nithisdale had prepared for Mrs. Mills, as\r\nMrs. Mills was to lend hers to Lord Nithisdale, so that in going out he\r\nmight be taken for her.  Mrs. Mills was also \"not only of the same\r\nheight, but nearly of the same size as my lord.\"  On their arrival at the\r\nTower, Mrs. Morgan was allowed to go in with {140} Lady Nithisdale.\r\n[Sidenote: 1716--Lord Nithisdale's escape] Only one at a time could be\r\nintroduced by the lady.  She left the riding-hood and other things behind\r\nher.  Then Lady Nithisdale went downstairs to meet Mrs. Mills, who held\r\nher handkerchief to her face, \"as was very natural for a woman to do when\r\nshe was going to bid her last farewell to a friend on the eve of his\r\nexecution.  I had indeed desired her to do it, that my lord might go out\r\nin the same manner.\"  Mrs. Mills's eyebrows were a light color, and Lord\r\nNithisdale's were dark and thick.  \"So,\" says Lady Nithisdale, \"I had\r\nprepared some paint of the color of hers to disguise his with.  I also\r\nbought an artificial head-dress of the same color as hers, and I painted\r\nhis face with white, and his cheeks with rouge to hide his long beard,\r\nwhich he had not time to shave.  All this provision I had before left in\r\nthe Tower.  The poor guards, whom my slight liberality the day before had\r\nendeared me to, let me go quietly with my company, and were not so\r\nstrictly on the watch as they usually had been, and the more so as they\r\nwere persuaded, from what I had told them the day before, that the\r\nprisoners would obtain their pardon.\"  Then Mrs. Mills was taken into the\r\nroom with Lord Nithisdale, and rather ostentatiously led by Lady\r\nNithisdale past several sentinels, and through a group of soldiers, and\r\nof the guards' wives and daughters.  When she got into Lord Nithisdale's\r\npresence she took off her riding-hood, and put on that which Mrs. Morgan\r\nhad brought for her.  Then Lady Nithisdale dismissed her, and took care\r\nthat she should not go out weeping as she had come in, in order, of\r\ncourse, that Lord Nithisdale, when he wont out, \"might the better pass\r\nfor the lady who came in crying and afflicted.\"  When Mrs. Mills was\r\ngone, Lady Nithisdale dressed up her husband \"in all my petticoats\r\nexcepting one.\"  Then she found that it was growing dark, and was afraid\r\nthat the light of the candles might betray her.  She therefore went out,\r\nleading the disguised nobleman by the hand, he holding his handkerchief\r\npressed to his eyes, as Mrs. Mills had done when she came in.  The {141}\r\nguards opened the doors, and Lady Nithisdale went down-stairs with him.\r\n\"As soon as he had cleared the door I made him walk before me for fear\r\nthe sentinels should take notice of his walk.\"  Some friends received\r\nLord Nithisdale, and conducted him to a place of security.  Lady\r\nNithisdale went back to her husband's prison, and \"When I was in the room\r\nI talked to him as if he had been really present, and answered my own\r\nquestions in my lord's voice as nearly as I could imitate it.  I walked\r\nup and down, as if we were conversing together, till I thought they had\r\ntime enough to clear themselves of the guards.  I then thought proper to\r\nmake off also.  I opened the door, and stood half in it, that those in\r\nthe outward chamber might hear what I said, but held it so close that\r\nthey could not look in.  I bid my lord a formal farewell for that night,\"\r\nand she added some words about the petition for his pardon, and told him,\r\n\"I flattered myself that I should bring favorable news.\"  Then she closed\r\nthe door with some force behind her, and \"I said to the servant as I\r\npassed by\"--who was ignorant of the whole transaction--\"that he need not\r\ncarry any candles to his master till my lord sent for him, as he desired\r\nto finish some prayers first.  I went down-stairs and called a coach, as\r\nthere were several on the stand.  I drove home to my lodgings.\"  Soon\r\nafter Lady Nithisdale was taken to the place of security where her\r\nhusband was remaining.  They took refuge at the Venetian ambassador's two\r\nor three days after.  Lord Nithisdale put on a livery, and went in the\r\nretinue of the ambassador to Dover.  The ambassador, it should be said,\r\nknew nothing about the matter, but his coach-and-six went to Dover to\r\nmeet his brother; and it was one of the servants of the embassy who acted\r\nin combination with Lord and Lady Nithisdale.  A small vessel was hired\r\nat Dover, and Lord Nithisdale escaped to Calais, where his wife shortly\r\nafter joined him.  It is said by nearly all contemporary writers that\r\nKing George, when he heard of the escape, took it very good-humoredly,\r\nand even {142} expressed entire satisfaction with it.  Lady Nithisdale\r\ndoes not seem to have believed this story of George's generosity.  The\r\nstatement made to her was that \"when the news was brought to the King, he\r\nflew into an excess of passion and said he was betrayed, for it could not\r\nhave been done without some confederacy.  He instantly despatched two\r\npersons to the Tower to see that the other prisoners were well secured.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1716--Anti-Catholic legislation]\r\n\r\nLord Derwentwater and Lord Kenmure were executed on Tower Hill on the\r\n24th of February.  The young and gallant Derwentwater declared on the\r\nscaffold that he withdrew his plea of guilty, and that he acknowledged no\r\none but James Stuart as his king.  Kenmure, too, protested his repentance\r\nat having, even formally, pleaded guilty, and declared that he died with\r\na prayer for James Stuart.  Lord Wintoun was not tried until the next\r\nmonth.  He was a poor and feeble creature, hardly sound in his mind.\r\n\"Not perfect in his intellectuals,\" a writer in a journal of the day\r\nobserved of him.  He was found guilty, but afterwards succeeded in making\r\nhis escape from the Tower.  Like Lord Nithisdale, he made his way to the\r\nContinent; and, like Lord Nithisdale, he died long after at Rome.\r\n\r\nHumbler Jacobites could escape too.  Forster escaped from Newgate through\r\nthe aid of a clever servant, and got off to France, while the angry Whigs\r\nhinted at connivance on the part of persons in high places.  The\r\nredoubted Brigadier Mackintosh, who figures in descriptions of the time\r\nas a \"beetle-browed, gray-eyed\" man of sixty, speaking \"broad Scotch,\"\r\nsucceeded in escaping, together with his son and seven others, in a rush\r\nof prisoners from the Newgate press-yard.  Mr. Charles Radcliffe had an\r\neven stranger escape; for one day, growing tired, as well he might, of\r\nprison life, he simply walked out of Newgate under the eyes of his\r\njailers, in the easy disguise of a morning suit and a brown tie-wig.\r\nOnce some Jacobite prisoners, who were being sent to the West Indian\r\nplantations, rose against the crew, seized the ship, steered it to\r\nFrance, and quietly settled down {143} there.  Later still some prisoners\r\ngot out even more easily.  Brigadier Mackintosh's brother was discharged\r\nfrom Newgate on his own prayer, and on showing that \"he was very old, and\r\naltogether friendless.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately after the execution of the rebel noblemen the ministry set to\r\nwork to take some steps which might render political intrigue and\r\nconspiracy less dangerous in the future.  One idea which especially\r\ncommended itself to the statesmen of that time was to make the laws more\r\nrigorous against Roman Catholics.  Law and popular feeling were already\r\nstrongly set against the Catholics.  On the death of Queen Anne, officers\r\nin the army, when informing their companies of the accession of the\r\nElector of Hanover, carried their loyal and religious enthusiasm so far\r\nas to call upon any of their hearers who might be Catholics to fall\r\nforthwith out of the ranks.  The writers who supported the Hanoverian\r\nsuccession, and were in the service of the Whig ministry, were not\r\nashamed to declare that the ceremony of the Paternoster would infallibly\r\ncure a stranger of the spleen, and that any man in his senses would find\r\nexcellent comedy in the recital of an Ave Mary.  \"How common it is,\" says\r\nthe writer of the _Patriot_, \"to find a wretch of this persuasion to be\r\ndeluded to such a degree that he shall imagine himself engaged in the\r\nsolemnity of devotion, while in reality he is exceeding the fopperies of\r\na Jack-pudding!\"  So great was the distrust of Catholics that it was\r\noften the practice to seize upon the horses of Catholic gentlemen in\r\norder to impede them in the risings which they were always supposed to be\r\nmeditating.  But the condition of the Catholics in England was not bad\r\nenough to content the ministry.  An Act was passed, in fact what would\r\nnow be called \"rushed,\" through Parliament, to \"strengthen the Protestant\r\ninterest in Great Britain,\" by making more severe \"the laws now in being\r\nagainst Papists,\" and by providing a more effective and exemplary\r\npunishment for persons who, being Papists, should venture to enlist in\r\nthe service of his Majesty.\r\n\r\n{144}\r\n\r\nThe spirit of political freedom, as we now understand it, had not yet\r\neven begun to glimmer upon the counsels of statesmen.  The idea had not\r\nyet arisen in the minds of Englishmen--even of men as able as\r\nWalpole--that liberty meant anything more than liberty for the expression\r\nof one's own opinions, and for the carrying into action of one's own\r\npolicy.  Those who were in power immediately made it their business to\r\nstrengthen their own hands, and to prevent as far as possible the growth\r\nof opinions, the expression of ideas, unfavorable to themselves.  Yet at\r\nsuch a time there were not wanting advocates of the administration to\r\nwrite that it was \"indeed the peculiar happiness and glory of an\r\nEnglishman that he must first quit these kingdoms before he can\r\nexperimentally know the want of public liberty.\"  Most people, even\r\nstill, read history by the light of ideas which prevailed up to the close\r\nof George the First's reign.  We are all ready enough to admit that in\r\nour time it would not be a free system which suppressed or prevented the\r\nexpression of other men's opinions, or which attached any manner of penal\r\nconsequence to the profession of one creed or the adhesion to one party.\r\nBut most of us are, nevertheless, ready enough to describe one period of\r\nEnglish history, the reign perhaps of one sovereign, as a period of\r\nreligious liberty, and another season, or reign, as a time when liberty\r\nwas suppressed.  Some Englishmen talk with enthusiasm of the spirit of\r\nElizabeth's reign, or the spirit of the reign of William the Third, and\r\ncondemn in unmeasured terms the spirit which influenced James the Second,\r\nand which would no doubt have influenced James the Second's son if he had\r\ncome to the throne.  But any one who will put aside for the moment his\r\nown particular opinions will see that in both cases the guiding principle\r\nwas exactly the same.  Never were there greater acts of political and\r\nreligious intolerance committed than during the reign of Elizabeth and\r\nduring the reign of William the Third.  The truth is that the modern idea\r\nof constitutional and political liberty did not {145} exist among English\r\nstatesmen even so recently as the reign of William the Third.  At the\r\nperiod with which we are now dealing it would not have occurred to any\r\nstatesman that there could be a wiser course to take than to follow up\r\nthe suppression of the insurrection of 1715 by making more stringent than\r\never the laws already in existence against the religion to which most of\r\nthe rebels belonged.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1716--The Triennial Bill]\r\n\r\nThe Government made another change of a different kind, and for which\r\nthere was better political justification.  They passed a measure altering\r\nthe period of the duration of parliaments.  At this time the limit of the\r\nexistence of a parliament was three years.  An Act was passed in 1641\r\ndirecting that Parliament should meet once at least in every three years.\r\nThis Act was repealed in 1664.  Another, and a different kind of\r\nTriennial Parliament Bill, passed in 1694.  This Act declared that no\r\nparliament should last for a longer period than three years.  But the\r\nsystem of short parliaments had not apparently been found to work with\r\nmuch satisfaction.  The impression that a House of Commons with so\r\nlimited a period of life before it would be more anxious to conciliate\r\nthe confidence and respect of the constituencies had not been justified\r\nin practice.  Indeed, the constituencies themselves at that time were not\r\nsufficiently awake to the meaning and the value of Parliamentary\r\nrepresentation to think of keeping any effective control over those whom\r\nthey sent to speak for them in Parliament.  Bribery and corruption were\r\nas rife and as extravagant under the triennial system as ever they had\r\nbeen before, or as they ever were since.  But no doubt the immediate\r\nobject of repealing the Triennial Bill was to obtain a better chance for\r\nthe new condition of things by giving it a certain time to work in\r\nsecurity.  If the new dynasty was to have any chance of success at all,\r\nit was necessary that ministers should not have to come almost\r\nimmediately before the country again.\r\n\r\nShippen in the Commons and Atterbury in the Lords {146} were among the\r\nmost strenuous opponents of the new measure.  Both staunch Jacobites,\r\nthey had everything to gain just then by frequent appeals to the country.\r\nShippen urged that it was unconstitutional in a Parliament elected for\r\nthree years to elect itself for seven years without an appeal to the\r\nconstituencies.  Steele defended the Bill on the ground that all the\r\nmischiefs which could be brought under the Septennial Act could be\r\nperpetrated under the Triennial, but that the good which might be\r\ncompassed under the Septennial could not be hoped for under the\r\nTriennial.  Not a few persons in both Houses seemed to be of one mind\r\nwith the bewildered Bishop of London, who declared that he did not know\r\nwhich way to vote, for \"he was confounded between dangers and\r\ninconveniences on one side and destruction on the other.\"  It is not out\r\nof place to mention here that when a Bill was unsuccessfully brought in\r\nnearly twenty years after for the Repeal of the Septennial Act, many of\r\nthose who had voted in favor of parliaments of seven years in 1716 voted\r\nthe other way, while opponents in 1716 were turned into allies in 1734.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1716--Death of Lord Somers]\r\n\r\nThe system of short parliaments has ardent admirers in our own day.\r\n\"Annual Parliaments\" formed one of the points of the People's Charter.\r\nMany who would not accept the Chartist idea of annual parliaments would\r\nstill regard as one of the articles of the true creed of Liberalism the\r\nprinciple of the triennial parliament.  But even if that creed were true\r\nin the politics of the present day, it would not have been true in the\r\nearly days of King George.  One of the great constitutional changes which\r\nthe times were then making, and which Walpole welcomed and helped to\r\ncarry out, was the change which gave to the House of Commons the real\r\nruling power in the Constitution.  No representative chamber could then\r\nhave held its own against the House of Lords, or the Court, or the Court\r\nand the House of Lords combined, if it had been subject to the necessity\r\nof frequent re-elections.  Short parliaments have even in our own days\r\nbeen made {147} in Europe the most effective weapons of despotic power.\r\nNo test more trying can be found for a party of men sincerely anxious to\r\nmaintain constitutional rights at a season of danger than to subject them\r\nto frequent and close electoral struggles.  Much more important in the\r\nhistorical and constitutional sense was it at the opening of King\r\nGeorge's reign that the House of Commons should be strengthened than that\r\nany particular party should have unlimited opportunities of trying its\r\nchances at a general election.  It mattered little, when once the\r\nposition of the representative body had been made secure, whether George\r\nor James sat on the throne.  With the representative body an\r\ninconsiderable factor in the State system, Brunswick would soon have been\r\nas unconstitutional as Stuart.\r\n\r\nOne of the last acts of the life of Lord Somers was to express to Lord\r\nTownshend his approval of the principle of the Septennial Bill.  He did\r\nnot live to see it actually passed into law.  He was but sixty-six years\r\nold at the time of his death.  Disease and not age had weakened his fine\r\nintellect, and had kept him for many years from playing any important\r\npart in the affairs of the State.  The day when Somers died was the very\r\nday when the Septennial Bill passed its third reading in the House of\r\nCommons.  It had come down from the House of Lords, and had to go back to\r\nthat House, in consequence of some alterations made in the Commons.\r\nSomers lived just long enough to be assured of its safety.  Born in 1650,\r\nthe son of a Worcester attorney, he had won for himself the proudest\r\nhonors of the law, and had written his name high up in the roll of\r\nEnglish statesmen.  Steele wrote of him that he was \"as much admired for\r\nhis universal knowledge of men and things as for his eloquence, courage,\r\nand integrity in the exerting of such extraordinary talents.\"  The\r\n_Spectator_, in dedicating its earliest papers to him, spoke of him as\r\none who brought into the service of his sovereign the arts and policies\r\nof ancient Greece and Rome, and praised him for a certain dignity in\r\n{148} himself which made him appear as great in private life as in the\r\nmost important offices he had borne.  It was in allusion to Somers,\r\nindeed, that Swift said Bolingbroke wanted for success \"a small infusion\r\nof the alderman.\"  This was a sneer at Somers, as well as a sort of\r\nrebuke to Bolingbroke.  If the \"small infusion of the alderman\" was\r\nanother term for order and method in public business, then it may be\r\nfreely admitted by his greatest admirers that Somers had more of the\r\nalderman in his nature than Bolingbroke.  Perhaps the only thing, except\r\ngreat capacity, which he had in common with Bolingbroke was an ungoverned\r\nadmiration of the charms of women.  His fame was first established by the\r\nability with which he conducted his part of the defence of the seven\r\nbishops in James the Second's reign.  His consistent devotion to the Whig\r\nparty, and his just and almost prescient appreciation of the true\r\nprinciples of that party, set him in sharp contrast to other statesmen of\r\nthe time--to men like Marlborough and Shrewsbury and Bolingbroke.  His is\r\na noble figure, even in its decay, and the historian of such a time parts\r\nfrom him with regret, feeling that the average of public manhood and\r\nvirtue is lowered when Somers is gone.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1716--Mary Wortley Montagu]\r\n\r\nWhile Jacobites were lingering in prison and dying on Tower Hill, Lady\r\nMary Wortley Montagu was writing from abroad imperishable letters to her\r\nfriends.  We may turn away from politics for a moment to observe her and\r\nher career.  Mr. Wortley Montagu had been appointed Ambassador to\r\nConstantinople, and had set out for his post, accompanied by the witty\r\nand beautiful wife for whom he cared so little.  Ever since he first met\r\nher and presented her with a copy of \"Quintus Curtius,\" in honor of her\r\nLatinity, and some original verses of his own, in earnest of his\r\nadmiration, he had been an exacting, impatient lover.  After his marriage\r\nhe seems to have grown absolutely indifferent to her, leaving her alone\r\nfor months together while he remained in town, and pleading as his excuse\r\nhis Parliamentary duties.  {149} She who, on the contrary, had made no\r\nunreasonable display of affection for the lover, appears to have become\r\ndeeply attached to the husband, and to have been bitterly pained by his\r\ncareless indifference, an indifference which at last, and it would appear\r\nmost unwillingly, she learned to return.  When this life had been lived\r\nfor a year or two Queen Anne died, and with Walpole's accession to power\r\nMr. Wortley got office, and brought his beautiful wife up from Yorkshire\r\nto be the wonder and admiration of the English Court and the Hanoverian\r\nmonarch.  For two bright years Lady Mary shone like a star in the\r\nbrilliant constellation of women, of wits, of politicians, and men of\r\nletters, who thronged St. James's Palace and peopled St. James's parish.\r\nThen came the Constantinople embassy.  Lady Mary had always a longing for\r\nforeign travel, and now that her desires were gratified she enjoyed\r\nherself with all the delight of a child and all the intelligence of a\r\ngifted woman.  Travel was a rare pleasure for women then.  A young\r\nEnglish gentleman made the grand tour, and brought back, if he were\r\nfoolish, nothing better than a few receipts for strange dishes, and some\r\nnewer notions of vice than he had set out with; if he were wise he became\r\n\"possessed of the tongues,\" and bore home spoils of voyage in the shape\r\nof Titians and Correggios and Raphaels--genuine or the reverse--to stock\r\na picture-gallery in the family mansion.  But women very seldom travelled\r\nmuch in those days.  Certainly no man or woman could then write of\r\ntravels as Mary Wortley Montagu could and did.  We may well imagine the\r\ndelight with which Mistress Skerret and Lady Rich and the Countess of\r\nBristol, languid Lord Hervey's mother, and adoring Mr. Pope received\r\nthese marvellous letters, which were destined to rank with the epistles\r\nof the younger Pliny and of Madame de Sévigné.  Mr. Pope--whose\r\ntranslation of the \"Odyssey\" had not yet made its appearance--may well\r\nhave thought that Ulysses himself had not seen men and cities to greater\r\nadvantage than the beautiful wanderer whom he was destined first {150} to\r\nlove and then to hate.  As we read her letters we seem to live with her\r\nin the great, gay, gloomy life of Vienna, to hear once more the foolish\r\nsquabbles of Ratisbon society as to who should and should not be styled\r\nExcellency, and to smile at the loyal crowds of English thronging the\r\nwretched inns of Hanover.  But the fidelity of her descriptions may best\r\nbe judged from her accounts of life in Constantinople.  The Vienna of\r\nto-day is very different from the ill-built, high-storied city of Maria\r\nTheresa; but the condition of Constantinople has scarcely changed with\r\nthe century and a half that has gone by since Lady Mary was English\r\nAmbassadress there.  She seems, indeed, to have seen the heads upon the\r\nfamous monument of bronze twisted serpents in the Hippodrome; and perhaps\r\nshe did, for Spon and Wheler's sketch of it in 1675 gives it with the\r\ntriple heads still perfect, though these serpent heads, and all traces of\r\nthem, have long since disappeared.  In Constantinople Lady Mary first\r\nbecame acquainted with that principle of inoculation for the small-pox\r\nwhich she so enthusiastically advocated, which she introduced into\r\nEngland in spite of so much hostility and disfavor, and which, now\r\naccepted by almost all the civilized world, is still wrangled fiercely\r\nover in England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1716--Lady Mary's career]\r\n\r\nPerhaps we may anticipate by some half-century to tell of Lady Mary's\r\nfurther career.  She came back to London again, and shone as brilliantly\r\nas before, and was made love to by Pope, and laughed at her lover, and\r\nwas savagely scourged by him in return with whips of stinging and\r\nshameful satire.  One can understand better the story of the daughters of\r\nLycambes hanging themselves under the pain of the iambics of Archilochus\r\nwhen one reads the merciless cruelty with which the great English\r\nsatirist treated the woman he had loved.  When Lady Mary grew old she\r\nwent away abroad to live, without any opposition on her husband's part.\r\nThey parted with mutual indifference and mutual esteem.  She lived for\r\nmany years in Italy, chiefly in Venice.  Then she came back to London for\r\na short time to live in lodgings off Hanover Square, and be the curiosity\r\nof the town; and then she died.  Lady Mary always had a dread of growing\r\nold; and she grew old and ill-favored, as Horace Walpole was spiteful\r\nenough to put on record.  When Pope was laughed at by the beauty, he\r\nmight have said to her in the words that Clarendon used to the fair\r\nCastlemaine, \"Woman, you will grow old,\" and have felt that in those\r\nwords he had almost repaid the bitterness of her scorn.  Horace Walpole\r\nindeed avenged the offended poet, long dead and famous, when he wrote\r\nthus of Lady Mary: \"Her dress, her avarice, and her impudence must amaze\r\nany one that never heard her name.  She wears a foul mob that does not\r\ncover her greasy black locks, that hang loose, never combed or curled; an\r\nold mazarine blue wrapper, that gapes open and discovers a canvas\r\npetticoat.  Her face . . . partly covered . . . with white paint, which\r\nfor cheapness she has bought so coarse that you would not use it to wash\r\na chimney.\"  Such is one of the latest portraits of the woman who had\r\nbeen a poet's idol and the cherished beauty of a Court.  Lady Mary, who\r\nhad outlived her husband, left an exemplary daughter, who married Lord\r\nBute, and a most unexemplary son, to whom she bequeathed one guinea, and\r\nwho spent the greater part of his life drifting about the East, and\r\nacquiring all kinds of strange and useless knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{152}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\"MALICE DOMESTIC.--FOREIGN LEVY.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1716--Visit to Hanover]\r\n\r\nSome of the earlier letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu are written\r\nfrom Hanover, and give a lively description of the crowded state of\r\nthat capital in the autumn of 1716.  Hanover was crowded in this\r\nunusual way because King George was there at the time, and his presence\r\nwas the occasion for a great gathering of diplomatic functionaries and\r\nstatesmen, and politicians of all orders.  Some had political missions,\r\nopen and avowed; some had missions of still greater political\r\nimportance, which, however, were not formally avowed, and were for the\r\nmost part conducted in secret.  A turning-point had been reached in the\r\naffairs of Europe, and the King's visit to Hanover was an appropriate\r\noccasion for the preliminary steps to certain new arrangements that had\r\nbecome inevitable.  Even before the King's visit to his dear Hanover\r\nthe English Government had been paving the way for some of these new\r\ncombinations and alliances.  The very day after the royal coronation,\r\nStanhope had gone on a mission to Vienna which had something to do with\r\nthe arrangements subsequently made.\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be paying too high a compliment to the patriotic\r\nenergy of the King to suppose that he had gone to Hanover for the sake\r\nof promoting arrangements calculated to be of advantage to England.\r\nLet us do justice to George's sincerity: he never pretended to any\r\nparticular concern for English interests when they were not bound up\r\nwith the interests of Hanover.  But he had long been pining for a sight\r\nof Hanover.  He had now been away from his beloved Herrenhausen for\r\nnearly two {153} years, and he was consumed by an unconquerable\r\nhomesickness.  That his absence might be inconvenient to his newly\r\nacquired country or to his ministers had no weight in his mind to\r\ncounterbalance the desire of walking once more in the prim Herrenhausen\r\navenues and looking over the level Hanoverian fields, or treading the\r\ncorridors of the old Schloss, where the ancestral Guelphs had revelled,\r\nand where the ghost of Königsmark might well be supposed to wander.\r\nThe Act for restraining the King from going out of the kingdom was\r\nrepealed in May, 1716.  The Prince of Wales was to be appointed\r\ntemporary ruler in the King's absence.  This appointment was the only\r\nobstacle that George admitted to his journey.  In the Hanover family,\r\nfather had hated son, and son father with traditional persistence.\r\nGeorge was animated by the sourest jealousy of his son.  One reason, if\r\nthere had been no other, for this animosity was that the young man was\r\nwell known to have some sympathy for the sufferings of his mother, the\r\nunhappy Sophia Dorothea, imprisoned in Ahlden, and he had at least once\r\nmade an unsuccessful effort to see her.  Since George came to England\r\nhe persisted in regarding his eldest son as a rival for popular favor,\r\nand this feeling was naturally kept alive by the enemies of the House\r\nof Hanover.  To this detested son George had now to intrust the care of\r\nhis kingdom, or else abandon his visit to dear Herrenhausen.  The\r\nstruggle was severe, but patriotic affection triumphed over paternal\r\nhatred.  The Prince was named not indeed Regent, but Guardian of the\r\nRealm and Lieutenant, with as many restrictions upon his authority as\r\nthe King was able or was allowed to impose, and on July 9th George set\r\nout for Hanover, accompanied by Secretary Stanhope.  He was not long\r\nabsent from England, however.  On November 14th he came back again.\r\nLoyalists issued prints of the monarch waited upon by angels, and\r\naccompanied by flattering verses addressed to the \"Presedent of ye\r\nLoyall Mug Houses.\"  But the devotion of the mug-houses could not make\r\nGeorge personally popular, or diminish the {154} general dislike to his\r\nGerman ministers, his German mistresses, and the horde of hungry\r\nforeigners--the Hanoverian rats, as Squire Western would have called\r\nthem--who came over with him to England, seeking for place and pension,\r\nor pension without place.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1716--Philip of Orleans]\r\n\r\nThe Thames was frozen over in the winter of this year, 1716, and London\r\nmade very merry over the event.  The ice was covered with booths for\r\nthe sale of all sorts of wares, and with small coffee-houses and\r\nchop-houses.  Wrestling-rings were formed in one part; in another, an\r\nox was roasted whole.  People played at push-pin, skated, or drove\r\nabout on ice-boats brave with flags.  Coaches moved slowly up and down\r\nthe highway of barges and wherries, and hawkers cried their wares\r\nlustily in the new field that winter had offered them.  All the banks\r\nof the river--and especially such places as the Temple Gardens--were\r\ncrowded with curious throngs surveying the animated and unusual scene.\r\n\r\nDuring George's absence from England he and his ministers had made some\r\nnew and important arrangements in the policy of Europe.  From this time\r\nforth--indeed, from the reign of Queen Anne--England was\r\ndestined--doomed, perhaps--to have a regular part in the politics of\r\nthe Continent.  Before that time she had often been drawn into them, or\r\nhad plunged enterprisingly or recklessly into them, but from the date\r\nof the accession of the House of Hanover England was as closely and\r\nconstantly mixed up in the political affairs of the Continent as\r\nAustria or France.  In the opening years of George's reign, France, the\r\nEmpire--Austria, that is to say, for the Holy Roman Empire had come to\r\nbe merely Austria--and Spain were the important Continental Powers.\r\nRussia was only coming up; the genius of Peter the Great was beginning\r\nto make her way for her.  Italy was as yet only a geographical\r\nexpression--a place divided among minor kings and princes, who in\r\npolitics sometimes bowed to the Pope's authority, and sometimes evaded\r\nor disregarded it.  The power of Turkey was {155} broken, never to be\r\nmade strong again; the republic of Venice was already beginning to\r\n\"sink like a sea-weed into whence she rose.\"  The position of Spain was\r\npeculiar.  Spain had for a long time been depressed and weak and\r\ndisregarded.  For many years it was thought that she was going down\r\nwith Turkey and Venice--that the star of her fate had declined forever.\r\nSuddenly, however, she began to raise her head above the horizon again,\r\nand to threaten the peace of the Continent.  The peace of the Continent\r\ncould not now be threatened without menace to the peace of England, for\r\nGeorge's Hanoverian dominions were sure to be imperilled by European\r\ndisturbance, and George would take good care that Hanover did not\r\nsuffer while England had armies to move and money to spend.  The\r\nEnglish Government found it necessary to look out for allies.\r\n\r\nFrance was under the rule of a remarkable man.  Philip, Duke of Orleans\r\nand Regent of the kingdom, ought to have been a statesman of the\r\nByzantine Empire.  He was steeped to the lips in profligacy; he had no\r\nmoral sense whatever, unless that which was supplied by the so-called\r\ncode of honor.  His intrigues, his carouses, his debaucheries, his\r\nhordes of mistresses, gave scandal even in that time of prodigal\r\nlicense.  But he had a cool head, a daring spirit, and an intellect\r\ncapable of accepting new and original ideas.  He must be called a\r\nstatesman; and, despite the vulgarity of some of his vices, he has to\r\nbe called a gentleman as well.  He could be trusted; he would keep his\r\nword once given.  Other statesmen could treat with him, and not fear\r\nthat he would break a promise or betray a confidence.  How rare such\r\nqualities were at that day among the politicians of any country the\r\nreaders of the annals of Queen Anne do not need to be told.  The\r\nRegent's principal adviser at this time was a man quite as immoral, and\r\nalso quite as able, as himself--the Abbé Dubois, afterwards Cardinal\r\nand Prime-minister.  Dubois had a profound knowledge of foreign\r\naffairs, and he thoroughly understood the ways of men.  {156} He had\r\nfought his way from humble rank to a great position in Church and\r\nState.  He had trained his every faculty--and all his faculties were\r\nwell worth the training--to the business of statecraft and of\r\ndiplomatic intrigue.  It is somewhat curious to note that the three\r\nablest politicians in Europe at that day were churchmen: Swift in\r\nEngland, Dubois in France, and Alberoni--of whom we shall presently\r\nhave to speak--in Spain.  The quick and unclouded intelligence of the\r\nRegent--unclouded despite his days and nights of debauchery--saw that\r\nthe cause of the Stuarts was gone.  While that cause had hope he was\r\nwilling to give it a chance, and he would naturally have welcomed its\r\nsuccess; but he had taken good care during its late and vain effort not\r\nto embroil himself in any quarrel, or even any misunderstanding, with\r\nEngland on its account; and now that that poor struggle was over for\r\nthe time, he believed that it would be for his interest to come to an\r\nunderstanding with King George.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1716--Dubois]\r\n\r\nThe idea of such an understanding originated with the Regent himself.\r\nThere has been some discussion among English historians as to the title\r\nof Townshend or of Stanhope to be considered its author.  Whether\r\nTownshend or Stanhope first accepted the suggestion does not seem a\r\nmatter of much consequence.  It is clear that the overture was made by\r\nthe Regent.  While King George and his minister Stanhope were in\r\nHanover, the Regent sent Dubois on various pretexts to places where he\r\nmight have an opportunity of coming to an understanding with both.\r\nDubois had lived in England, and had made the personal acquaintance of\r\nStanhope there.  What could be more natural than that the Regent, who\r\nwas a lover of art, should ask Dubois to visit the Hague, for the\r\npurpose of buying some books and pictures, about the time that the\r\nEnglish minister was known to be in the neighborhood?  And how could\r\nold acquaintances like Stanhope and Dubois, thus brought into close\r\nproximity, fail to take advantage of the opportunity, and to {157} have\r\nmany a quiet, informal meeting?  What more natural than that Dubois\r\nshould afterwards go to Hanover to visit his friend Stanhope there, and\r\nthat he should live in Stanhope's house?  The account which the lively\r\nLady Mary Wortley Montagu gives of the manner in which Hanover was then\r\ncrowded would of itself explain the necessity for Dubois availing\r\nhimself of Stanhope's hospitality, and for Stanhope's offer of it.  The\r\nPortuguese ambassador, Lady Mary says, thought himself very happy to be\r\nthe temporary possessor of \"two wretched parlors in an inn.\"  Dubois\r\nand Stanhope had many talks, and the result was an arrangement which\r\ncould be accepted by the King and the Regent.\r\n\r\nThe foreign policy of the Whigs had for its object the maintenance of\r\npeace on the European continent by a close observance of the conditions\r\nlaid down in the Treaty of Utrecht.  The settlement made under that\r\ntreaty was, however, very unsatisfactory to Spain.  The new Spanish\r\nking, Philip of Anjou, had formally renounced his own rights of\r\nsuccession to the throne of France, and had given up the Italian\r\nprovinces which formerly belonged to the Spanish Crown.  But, as in\r\nmost such instances at that time, an ambitious European sovereign had\r\nno sooner accepted conditions which appeared to him in any wise\r\nunsatisfactory, than he went to work to endeavor to set them aside, or\r\nget out of them somehow.  Philip's whole mind was turned to the object\r\nof getting back again all that he had given up.  This would not have\r\nseemed an easy task, even to a man of the stamp of Charles the Fifth.\r\nIt would almost appear that any attempt in such a direction must bring\r\nEurope in arms against Spain.  The Regent Duke of Orleans stood next in\r\nsuccession to the French throne, in consequence of Philip's\r\nrenunciation of his rights by virtue of the Treaty of Utrecht.  The\r\nItalian provinces which had once been Spain's were now handed over to\r\nAustria, and Austria would of course be resolute in their defence.\r\nKing Philip was not the man to confront the difficulties of a situation\r\nof this kind {158} by his own unaided powers of mind.  He was very far\r\nindeed from being a Charles the Fifth.  He was not even a Philip the\r\nSecond.  But he had for his minister a man as richly endowed with\r\nstatesmanship and courage as he himself was wanting in those qualities.\r\n[Sidenote: 1716--Alberoni] Giulio Alberoni, an Italian born at\r\nPiacenza, in 1664, was at one time appointed agent of the Duke of Parma\r\nat the Court of Spain, and in this position acquired very soon the\r\nfavor of Philip.  Alberoni was of the most humble origin.  His father\r\nwas a gardener, and he himself a poor village priest.  He rose,\r\nhowever, both in diplomacy and in the Church, having worked his way up\r\nto the favor of the Duke of Parma, to work still further on to the\r\ncomplete favor of Philip the Fifth.  The first marked success in his\r\nupward career was made when he contrived to commend himself to the Duc\r\nde Vendôme, the greatest French commander of his day.  The Duke of\r\nParma had occasion to deal with Vendôme, and sent the Bishop of Parma\r\nto confer with him.  The Duc de Vendôme was a man who affected\r\nroughness and brutality of manners, and made it his pride to set all\r\nrules of decency at defiance.  Peter the Great, Potemkin, Suwarrow,\r\nwould have seemed men of ultra-refinement when compared with him.  His\r\nmanner of receiving the bishop was such that the bishop quitted his\r\npresence abruptly and without saying a word, and returning to Parma,\r\ntold his master that no consideration on earth should induce him ever\r\nto approach the brutal French soldier again.  Alberoni was beginning to\r\nrise at this time.  He offered to undertake the mission, feeling sure\r\nthat not even Vendôme could disconcert him.  He was intrusted with the\r\ntask of renewing the negotiations, and he obtained admission to the\r\npresence of Vendôme.  Every reader remembers the story in the \"Arabian\r\nNights\" of that brother of the talkative barber who threw himself into\r\nthe spirit of the rich Barmecide's humor, and by outdoing him in the\r\npractical joke secured forever his favor and his friendship.  Alberoni\r\nacted on this principle at his first meeting with Vendôme.  {159} He\r\noutbuffooned even Vendôme's buffoonery.  The story will not bear minute\r\nexplanation, but Alberoni soon satisfied Vendôme that he had to do with\r\na man after his own heart, what Elizabethan writers would have called a\r\n\"mad wag\" indeed, and Vendôme gave him his confidence.\r\n\r\nAlberoni was made prime-minister by Philip in 1716, and cardinal by the\r\nCourt of Rome shortly after.  The ambition of Alberoni was in the first\r\ninstance to recover to Spain her lost Italian provinces, and to raise\r\nSpain once more to the commanding position she had held when Charles\r\nthe Fifth abdicated the crown.  Alberoni's policy, indeed, was a\r\nmistake as regarded the strength and the prosperity of Spain.  Spain's\r\nItalian and Flemish provinces were of no manner of advantage to her.\r\nThey were sources of weakness, because they constantly laid Spain open\r\nto an attack from any enemy who had the advantage of being able to\r\nchoose his battle-ground for himself so long as Spain had outlying\r\nprovinces scattered over the Continent.  Indeed, it is made clear, from\r\nthe testimony of many observers, that Spain was rapidly recovering her\r\ndomestic prosperity from the moment when she lost those provinces, and\r\nwhen the continual strain to which they exposed her finances was\r\nstopped.  At that epoch of Europe's political development, however, the\r\nidea had hardly occurred to any statesman that national greatness could\r\ncome about in any other way than by the annexing or the recovery of\r\nterritory.  Alberoni intrigued against the Regent, and was particularly\r\nanxious to injure the Emperor.  He was well inclined to enter into\r\nnegotiations, and even into an alliance, with England.  He lent his\r\nhelp when first he took office to bring to a satisfactory conclusion\r\nsome arrangements for a commercial treaty between England and Spain.\r\nThis treaty gave back to British subjects whatever advantages in trade\r\nthey had enjoyed under the Austrian kings of Spain, and contained what\r\nwe should now call a most favored nation clause, providing that no\r\nBritish subjects should be {160} exposed to higher duties than were\r\npaid by Spaniards.  Alberoni cautiously refrained from giving any\r\nencouragement to the Stuarts, and always professed to the British\r\nminister the strongest esteem and friendship for King George.  Stanhope\r\nhimself had known Alberoni formerly in Spain, and had from the first\r\nformed a very high opinion of his abilities.  He now opened a\r\ncorrespondence with the cardinal, expressing a strong wish for a\r\nsincere and lasting friendship between England and Spain; and this\r\ncorrespondence was kept up for some time in so friendly and\r\nconfidential a manner that very little was left for the regular\r\naccredited minister from Spain at the Court of King George to do.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1714-1718--The Triple Alliance]\r\n\r\nAlberoni, however, was somewhat too vain and impatient.  He had brought\r\nover Sweden to his side, partly because he found Charles the Twelfth in\r\na bad humor on account of the cession to Hanover of certain Swedish\r\nterritories by the King of Denmark, who had clutched them while the\r\nwarlike Charles was away in Turkey.  The cession of those places\r\nbrought Hanover to the sea, and was of importance thus to Hanover and\r\nto England alike.  George the Elector was in his petty way an ambitious\r\nHanoverian prince, however little interest he had in English affairs.\r\nHe had always been anxious to get possession of the districts of Bremen\r\nand Verden, which had been handed over to Sweden at the Peace of\r\nWestphalia.  Reckless enterprise had carried Charles the\r\nTwelfth--\"Swedish Charles,\" with \"a frame of adamant, a soul of fire,\"\r\nwhom no dangers frighted, and no labors tired, the \"unconquered lord of\r\npleasure and of pain\"--too far in the rush of his chivalrous madness.\r\nHis vaulting ambition had overleaped itself, and fallen on the other\r\nside; and after his defeat at Pultowa, all his enemies, some of whom he\r\nhad scared into inaction before, turned upon him as the nations of\r\nEurope turned upon Napoleon the First after Moscow.  Charles had gone\r\ninto Turkey and taken refuge there, and it seemed as if he had fallen\r\nnever to rise again.  In his absence the King of Denmark {161} seized\r\nSchleswig-Holstein, Bremen, and Verden.  At the close of 1714 Charles\r\nsuddenly roused himself from depression and appeared at the town of\r\nStralsund, almost as much to the alarm of Europe as Napoleon had caused\r\nwhen he left Elba and landed on the southern shore of France.  The King\r\nof Denmark shuddered at the prospect of a struggle with Charles, and in\r\norder to secure some part of his spoils he entered into a treaty with\r\nthe Elector of Hanover, by virtue of which he handed over Bremen and\r\nVerden to George, on condition that George should pay him a handsome\r\nsum of money, and join him in resisting Sweden.\r\n\r\nNothing could be less justifiable, or indeed more nefarious, than these\r\narrangements.  They were discreditable to George the First, and they\r\nwere disgraceful to the King of Denmark.  Yet the general policy of\r\nthat time seems to have approved of the whole transaction, and regarded\r\nit merely as a good stroke of business for Hanover and for England.\r\nAlberoni, having secured the help of Sweden, got together great forces\r\nboth by sea and by land, and prepared for a reconquest of the lost\r\nItalian provinces.  He occupied Sardinia, and made an attempt on\r\nSicily.  But this was going a little too far and too fast.  Alberoni\r\nfrightened the great States of Europe into activity against him.\r\nEngland, France, and Holland formed a triple alliance, the basis of\r\nwhich was that the House of Hanover should be guaranteed in England,\r\nand the House of Orleans in France, should the young King, Louis the\r\nFifteenth, die without issue.  Not long after, the triple alliance was\r\nexpanded into a quadruple alliance, the Emperor of Germany becoming one\r\nof its members.  An English fleet appeared in the Straits of Messina,\r\nand a sea-fight took place in which the Spaniards lost almost all their\r\nvessels.  Alberoni tried to get up another fleet under the Duke of\r\nOrmond for the purpose of making a landing in Scotland, with a view to\r\na great Jacobite rising.  But the seas and skies seem always to have\r\nbeen fatal to Spanish projects against England, and {162} the\r\nexpedition under Ormond was as much of a failure as the far greater\r\nexpedition under Alexander of Parma.  The fleet was wrecked in the Bay\r\nof Biscay.  The French were invading the northern provinces of Spain,\r\nand the King of Spain was compelled not only to get rid of Alberoni,\r\nbut to renounce once more any claim to the French throne, and to\r\nabandon his attempts on Sardinia and Sicily.  Another danger was\r\nremoved from England by the death of Charles the Twelfth.  \"A petty\r\nfortress and a dubious hand\" brought about the end of him who had,\r\n\"like the wind's blast, never-resting, homeless,\" stormed so long\r\nacross war-convulsed Europe, and \"left that name at which the world\r\ngrew pale to point a moral or adorn a tale.\"  Charles the Twelfth had\r\njust entered into an alliance with Peter the Great for an enterprise to\r\ndestroy the House of Hanover and restore the Stuarts, when the\r\nmemorable bullet at the siege of Frederickshald, in Norway, brought his\r\nstrange career to a close in December, 1718.  A junction between such\r\nmen as Charles the Twelfth and Peter the Great might indeed have had\r\nmatter in it.  Peter was probably the greatest sovereign born to a\r\nthrone in modern Europe.  An alliance between Peter's profound sagacity\r\nand indomitable perseverance, and Charles's unbounded courage and\r\nmilitary skill, might have been ominous for any cause against which it\r\nwas aimed.  The good-fortune which from first to last seems on the\r\nwhole to have attended the House of Hanover, and followed it even in\r\nspite of itself, was with it when the bullet from an unknown hand\r\nstruck down Charles the Twelfth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1715-1718--Futility of the Triple Alliance]\r\n\r\nThese international arrangements have for us now very little real\r\ninterest.  They were entirely artificial and temporary.  Nothing came\r\nof them that could long endure or make any real change in the relations\r\nof the European States.  They had hardly anything to do with the\r\ninterests of the various peoples over whose heads and without whose\r\nknowledge or concern they were made.  It was still firmly believed that\r\ntwo or three diplomatists, meeting in {163} a half-clandestine way in a\r\nminister's closet or a lady's drawing-room, could come to agreements\r\nwhich would bind down nations and rule political movements.  The first\r\nreal upheaving of any genuine force, national or personal, in European\r\nlife tore through all their meshes in a moment.  Frederick the Great,\r\nsoon after, is to compel Europe to reconstruct her scheme of political\r\narrangements; later yet, the French Revolution is to clear the ground\r\nmore thoroughly and violently still.  The triple alliance, concocted by\r\nthe Regent and Stanhope and Dubois, had not the slightest permanent\r\neffect on the general condition of Europe.  It was a clever and an\r\noriginal idea of the Regent to think of bringing England and France,\r\nthese old hereditary enemies, into a permanent alliance, and it was\r\nright of Stanhope to enter into the spirit of the enterprise; but the\r\nactual conditions of England and France, did not allow of an abiding\r\nfriendship.  The national interest, as it was then understood, of the\r\none State was in antagonism to the national interest of the other.  Nor\r\ncould France and England combined have kept down the growth of other\r\nEuropean States then rising into importance and beginning to cast their\r\nshadows far in front of them.  It seems only amusing to us now to read\r\nof King George's directions to his minister--\"To crush the Czar\r\nimmediately, to secure his ships, and even to seize his person.\"  The\r\ncourageous and dull old King had not the faintest perception of the\r\npart which either the Czar or the Czar's country was destined to play\r\nin the history of Europe.  At present we are all inclined, and with\r\nsome reason, to think that French statesmen, as a rule, are wanting in\r\na knowledge of foreign politics--in an appreciation of the relative\r\nproportions of one force and another in the affairs of Europe outside\r\nFrance.  But in the days of George the First French statesmen were much\r\nmore accomplished in the knowledge of foreign politics than the\r\nstatesmen of England.  There was not, probably, in George's\r\nadministration any man who had anything like the knowledge of the {164}\r\naffairs of foreign countries which was possessed by Dubois.  But it had\r\nnot yet occurred to the mind of Dubois, or the Regent, or anybody else,\r\nthat the relations of one State to another, or one people to another,\r\nare anything more than the arrangements which various sets of\r\ndiplomatic agents think fit to make among themselves and to consign to\r\nthe formality of a treaty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1717--Walpole bides his time]\r\n\r\nThe interest we have now in all these \"understandings,\" engagements,\r\nand so-called alliances is personal rather than national.  So far as\r\nEngland is concerned, they led to a squabble and a split in George's\r\nadministration.  It would hardly be worth while to go into a minute\r\nhistory of the quarrel between Townshend and Stanhope, Sunderland and\r\nWalpole.  Sunderland, a man of great ability and ambition, had never\r\nbeen satisfied with the place he held in the King's administration, and\r\nthe disputes which sprang up out of the negotiations for the triple\r\nalliance gave him an opportunity of exerting his influence against some\r\nof his colleagues.  Fresh occasion for intrigue, jealousy, and anger\r\nwas given by the desire of the King to remain during the winter in\r\nHanover, and his fear, on the other hand, that his son--the Prince who\r\nwas at the head of affairs in his absence--was forming a party against\r\nhim, and was caballing with some of the members of the Government.\r\nSunderland acted on the King's narrow and petty fears.  He distinctly\r\naccused Townshend and Walpole of a secret understanding with the Prince\r\nand the Duke of Argyll against the Sovereign's interests.  The result\r\nof all this was that the King dismissed Lord Townshend, and that\r\nWalpole insisted on resigning office.  The King, to do him justice,\r\nwould gladly have kept Walpole in his service, but Walpole would not\r\nstay.  It is clear that Walpole was glad of the opportunity of getting\r\nout of the ministry.  He professed to be deeply touched by the\r\nearnestness of the King's remonstrances.  He was moved, it is stated,\r\nto tears.  At all events, he got very successfully through the ceremony\r\nof tear-shedding.  But although he wept, he did not {165} soften.  His\r\npurpose remained fixed.  He went out of office, and, to all intents and\r\npurposes, passed straightway into opposition.  Stanhope became First\r\nLord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer.\r\n\r\nFor a long time it must have been apparent to every one that Walpole\r\nwas the coming minister.  Walpole himself must have felt satisfied on\r\nthe point; but he was probably well content to admit to himself that\r\nhis time had not yet come.  Walpole was not a great man.  He wanted the\r\nmoral qualities which are indispensable to greatness.  He was almost as\r\nmuch wanting in them as Bolingbroke himself.  But if his genius was far\r\nless brilliant than that of Bolingbroke, he was amply furnished with\r\npatience and steadiness.  He could wait.  He did not devise half a\r\ndozen plans for one particular object, and fly from one to the other\r\nwhen the moment for action was approaching, and end by rejecting them\r\nall when the moment for action had arrived.  He made up his mind to a\r\ncertain course, and he held to it; if its chance did not come to-day,\r\nit might come to-morrow.  He had no belief in men's sincerity--or\r\nwomen's either.  There seems reason to believe that the famous saying\r\nascribed to him, about every man having his price, was not used by him\r\nin that unlimited sense; that he only spoke of \"these men\"--of certain\r\nmen--and said that every one of them had his price.  But he always\r\nacted as if the description he gave of \"these men\" might safely be\r\nextended to all men.  He had a coarse, licentious nature.  He enjoyed\r\nthe company of loose women.  He loved obscene talk; not merely did he\r\nlove it, but he indulged in and encouraged it for practical purposes of\r\nhis own; he thought it useful at men's dinner-parties, because it gave\r\neven the dullest man a subject on which he could find something to say.\r\nOne could not call Walpole a patriot in the higher sense; he wanted\r\naltogether that fine fibre in his nature, that exalted, half-poetic\r\nfeeling, that faculty of imagination which quickens practical and\r\nprosaic objects with the spirit of the ideal, and which are {166}\r\nneeded to make a man a patriot in the noblest meaning of the word.  But\r\nhe loved his country in his own heavy, practical, matter-of-fact sort\r\nof way, and that was just the sort of way which at the time happened to\r\nbe most useful to England.  Let it be said, too, in justice to Walpole,\r\nthat the most poetic and lyrical nature would have found little subject\r\nfor enthusiasm in the England of Walpole's earlier political career.\r\nIt was not exactly the age for a Philip Sidney or for a Milton.\r\nEngland's home and foreign policy had for years been singularly\r\nignoble.  At home it had been a conflict of mean intrigues; abroad, a\r\npolicy of selfish alliances and base compromises and surrenders.  The\r\nsplendid military genius of Marlborough only shone as it did as if to\r\nthrow into more cruel light the infamy of the intrigues and plots to\r\nwhich it was often sacrificed.  No man could be enthusiastic about\r\nQueen Anne or George the First.  The statesmen who professed the utmost\r\nardor for the Stuart cause were ready to sell it at a moment's notice,\r\nto secure their own personal position; most of those who grovelled\r\nbefore King George were known to have been in treaty, up to the last,\r\nwith his rival.  [Sidenote: 1717--Economist statesmen] We may excuse\r\nWalpole if, under such conditions, he took a prosaic view of the state\r\nof things, and made his patriotism a very practical sort of service to\r\nhis country.  It was, as we have said, precisely the sort of service\r\nEngland just then stood most in need of.  Walpole applied himself to\r\nsecure for his country peace and retrenchment.  He did not, indeed,\r\nmaintain a sacred principle of peace; he had no sacred principle about\r\nanything.  We shall see more lately that he did not scruple, for party\r\nreasons, to lend himself to a wanton and useless war, well knowing it\r\nwas wanton and useless; but his general policy was one of peace, and so\r\nlong as he had his own way there would have been no waste of England's\r\nresources on foreign battle-fields.  He despised war, and the trade of\r\nwar, in his heart.  To him war showed only in its vulgar, practical,\r\nand repulsive features; the soldier was a man who got paid for the\r\n{167} trade of killing.  Walpole might be likened to a shrewd and\r\nsensible steward who is sincerely anxious to manage his master's estate\r\nwith order and economy, and who, for that very reason, is willing to\r\nindulge his master's vices and to sanction his prodigalities to a\r\ncertain extent, knowing that if he attempts to draw the purse-strings\r\ntoo closely an open rupture will be the result, and then some steward\r\nwill come in who has no taste for saving, and who will let everything\r\ngo to rack and ruin.  He was the first of the long line of English\r\nministers who professed to regard economy as one of the great objects\r\nof statesmanship.  He established securely the principle that to make\r\nthe two ends meet was one of the first duties of patriotism.  He\r\nfounded, if we may use such an expression, the dynasty of statesmen to\r\nwhich Pitt and Peel and Gladstone belong.  The change in our\r\nconstitutional ways which set up that new dynasty was of infinitely\r\ngreater importance to England than the change which settled the\r\nBrunswicks in the place of the Stuarts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{168}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nHOME AFFAIRS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1717--Oxford's impeachment]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the public seemed to have forgotten all about Lord Oxford.\r\n\"Harley, the nation's great support,\" as Swift had called him, had been\r\nnearly two years in the Tower, and the nation did not seem to miss its\r\ngreat support, or to care anything about him.  In May, 1717, Lord\r\nOxford sent a petition to the House of Lords, complaining of the\r\nhardship and injustice of this unaccountable delay in his impeachment,\r\nand the House of Lords began at last to put on an appearance of\r\nactivity.  The Commons, too, revived and enlarged their secret\r\ncommittee, of which it will be remembered that Walpole was the\r\nchairman.  Times, however, had changed.  Walpole was not in the\r\nadministration, and felt no anxiety to assist the ministry in any way.\r\nHe purposely absented himself from the sittings, and a new chairman had\r\nto be chosen.  Probably Walpole had always known well enough that there\r\nwas not evidence to sustain a charge of high-treason against his former\r\nrival; perhaps, now that the rival was down in the dust, never to rise\r\nagain, he did not care to press for his punishment.  At all events, he\r\nmade it clear that he felt no interest in the impeachment of Lord\r\nOxford.  The friends of the ruined minister had recourse to an\r\ningenious artifice.  June 24, 1717, had been appointed for the opening\r\nof the proceedings.  Westminster Hall, lately the scene of the\r\nimpeachment of Somers, and soon to be the scene of the impeachment of\r\nWarren Hastings, was of course the place where Oxford had to come\r\nforward and meet his accusers.  The King, the Prince and the Princess\r\nof Wales were seated in the {169} Hall; most of the foreign ambassadors\r\nand ministers were spectators.  The imposing formalities and artificial\r\nterrors of such a ceremonial were kept up.  Lord Oxford had been\r\nbrought from the Tower to Westminster by water.  He was now led\r\nbareheaded up to the bar by the Deputy Lieutenant of the Tower, having\r\nthe axe borne before him, its edge turned away from him as yet,\r\nsymbolic of the doom that might await the prisoner, but to which he had\r\nnot yet been declared responsible.  When the reading of the articles of\r\nimpeachment and other opening passages of the trial had been gone\r\nthrough, Lord Harcourt, Oxford's friend, interposed, and announced that\r\nhe had a motion to make.  In order to hear his motion, the Peers had to\r\nwithdraw to their own House.  There Lord Harcourt moved that the House\r\nshould dispose of the two articles of impeachment for high-treason\r\nbefore going into any of the evidence to support the charges for high\r\ncrimes and misdemeanors.  The argument for this course of proceeding\r\nwas plausible.  If Oxford were convicted of high-treason he would have\r\nto forfeit his life; and in such case, where would be the use of\r\nconvicting him of a minor offence?  The plan on which the Commons\r\nproposed to act, that of taking all the evidence in order of time, no\r\nmatter to which charge it had reference, before coming to any\r\nconclusion, might, as Lord Harcourt put it, \"draw the trial into\r\nprodigious length,\" and absolutely to no purpose.  Should the accused\r\nbe found guilty of high-treason he must suffer death, and there would\r\nbe an end of the whole business.  Should he be acquitted of the graver\r\ncharge, he might then be impeached on the lighter accusation; and what\r\nharm would have been done or time lost?  The motion was carried by a\r\nmajority of eighty-eight to fifty-six.\r\n\r\nNow it is hardly possible to suppose that the Peers who voted in the\r\nmajority did not know very well that the Commons would not, and could\r\nnot, submit to have their mode of conducting an impeachment, which it\r\nwas their business to manage, thus altered at the sudden {170}\r\ndictation of the other chamber.  The House of Commons was growing in\r\nimportance every day; the House of Lords was proportionately losing its\r\ninfluence.  The Commons determined that they would conduct the\r\nimpeachment in their own way or not at all.  Doubtless some of them,\r\nmost of them, were glad to be well out of the whole affair.  July 1st\r\nwas fixed for the renewal of the proceedings.  Some fruitless\r\nconferences between Lords and Commons wasted two days, and on the\r\nevening of July 3d the Lords sat in Westminster Hall, and invited by\r\nproclamation the accusers of Oxford to appear.  No manager came forward\r\nto conduct the impeachment on the part of the Commons.  The Peers sat\r\nfor a quarter of an hour, as if waiting for a prosecutor, well knowing\r\nthat none was coming.  A solemn farce was played.  The Peers went back\r\nto their chamber, and there a motion was made acquitting \"Robert, Earl\r\nof Oxford and Earl Mortimer,\" on the ground that no charge had been\r\nmaintained against him.  A crowd without hailed the adoption of the\r\nmotion with cheers.  Oxford was released from the Tower, and nothing\r\nmore was ever heard of his impeachment.  The Duke of Marlborough was\r\nfurious with rage at Oxford's escape, and the duchess is described as\r\n\"almost distracted that she could not obtain her revenge.\"  Magnanimity\r\nwas not a characteristic virtue of the early days of the Georges.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1718--Disabilities of dissenters]\r\n\r\nThis was what has sometimes been called the honorable acquittal of\r\nOxford.  An English judge once spoke humorously of a prisoner having\r\nbeen \"honorably acquitted on a flaw in the indictment.\"  Harley's was\r\nlike this: it was not an acquittal, and it was not honorable to the man\r\nimpeached, the House that forebore to press the impeachment, or the\r\nHouse that contrived his escape from trial.  Oxford had been committed\r\nto the Tower and impeached for reasons that had little to do with his\r\nguilt or innocence, or with true public policy; he was released from\r\nprison and relieved from further proceedings in just the same way.\r\nThere was not evidence against {171} him on which he could be convicted\r\nof high-treason, and this was well known to his enemies when they first\r\nconsigned him to the Tower.  But there could not be the slightest moral\r\ndoubt on the mind of any man that Oxford had intrigued with the\r\nStuarts, and had endeavored to procure their restoration, and that he\r\nhad done this even since his committal to the Tower.  His guilt,\r\nwhatever it was, had been increased by him, and not diminished, since\r\nthe beginning of the proceedings taken against him.  But he had only\r\ndone what most other statesmen of that day had been doing, or would\r\nhave done if they had seen advantage in it.  He was not more guilty\r\nthan some of his bitterest opponents, the Duke of Marlborough among\r\nothers.  All but the very bitterest opponents were glad to be done with\r\nthe whole business.  It must have come to a more or less farcical end\r\nsooner or later, and sensible men were of opinion that the sooner the\r\nbetter.  Of Harley, \"Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer,\" as his titles\r\nran, we shall not hear any more; we have already foreshadowed the\r\nremainder of his life and his death.  This short account of his sham\r\nimpeachment is introduced here merely as a part of the historic\r\ncontinuity of the narrative.  History has few characters less\r\ninteresting than that of Oxford.  He held a position of greatness\r\nwithout being great; he fell, and even his fall could not invest him\r\nwith tragic dignity.\r\n\r\nOn December 13, 1718, Lord Stanhope, who had been raised to the\r\npeerage, first as Viscount and then as Earl Stanhope, introduced into\r\nthe House of Lords a measure ingeniously entitled \"A Bill for\r\nStrengthening the Protestant Interest in these Kingdoms.\"  The title of\r\nthe Bill was strictly appropriate according to our present ideas, and\r\naccording to the ideas of enlightened men in Stanhope's days also; but\r\nit must at first have misled some of Stanhope's audience.  Most\r\nChurchmen are now ready to admit that the interests of the Church of\r\nEngland are strengthened by every measure which tends to secure\r\nreligious equality; but most Churchmen were not quite so {172} sure of\r\nthis in the reign of George the First.  The Bill brought in by Stanhope\r\nwas really a measure intended to relieve Dissenters from some of the\r\npenalties and disabilities imposed on them in the reign of Queen Anne.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1719--Catholic emancipation foreshadowed]\r\n\r\nThe second reading of the Bill was the occasion of a long and animated\r\ndebate.  Several noble lords appealed to the opinion of the bishops,\r\nand the bishops spoke in answer to the appeal.  The Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, the Archbishop of York, the Bishop of London, the Bishop of\r\nBristol, the Bishop of Rochester (Atterbury), the Bishop of Chester,\r\nand other prelates, spoke against the Bill.  The Bishop of Bangor, the\r\nBishop of Gloucester, the Bishop of Lincoln, the Bishop of Norwich, and\r\nthe Bishop of Peterborough spoke in its favor.  The Bishop of\r\nPeterborough's was a strenuous and an eloquent argument in favor of the\r\nprinciple of the Bill.  \"The words 'Church' and 'Church's danger,'\"\r\nsaid the Bishop of Peterborough, \"had often been made use of to carry\r\non sinister designs; and then these words made a mighty noise in the\r\nmouth of silly women and children;\" but in his opinion the Church,\r\nwhich he defined to be a scriptural institution upon a legal\r\nestablishment, was founded upon a rock, and \"could not be in danger as\r\nlong as we enjoyed the light of the Gospel and our excellent\r\nconstitution.\"  The argument would have been perfect if the eloquent\r\nbishop had only left out the proviso about \"our excellent\r\nconstitution;\" for the opponents of the measure were contending, as was\r\nbut natural, that the Bill, if passed into law, would not leave to the\r\nChurch the constitutional protection which it had previously enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThe Bill passed the House of Lords on December 23d, and was sent down\r\nto the Commons next day.  It was read there a first time at once, was\r\nread a second time after a debate of some nine hours, and was passed\r\nwithout amendment by a majority of 221 against 170 on January 10, 1719.\r\nThe test majority, however, by which the Bill had been decisively\r\ncarried, on the motion to go into committee, was but small--243 against\r\n202--and this {173} majority was mainly due to the vote of the Scottish\r\nmembers.  Stanhope, it is well known, would have made the measure more\r\nliberal than it was, and was dissuaded from this intention by\r\nSunderland, who insisted that if it were too liberal it would not pass\r\nthe House of Commons.  The result seems to prove that Sunderland was\r\nright.  Walpole spoke against the Bill, limited as its concessions\r\nwere.  It would be interesting to know what sort of argument a man of\r\nWalpole's principles could have offered against a measure embodying the\r\nvery spirit and sense of Whig policy.  Unfortunately we have no means\r\nof knowing.  The galleries of the House of Commons were rigidly closed\r\nagainst strangers on the day of the debate, and all we are allowed to\r\nhear concerning Walpole's part in the discussion is that \"Mr. Robert\r\nWalpole made a warm speech, chiefly levelled against a great man in the\r\npresent administration.\"  There is something characteristic of Walpole\r\nin this.  He was never very particular about principle, or even about\r\nseeming consistency; but still, when opposing a measure which he might\r\nhave been expected to support, he would have probably found it more\r\nexpedient, as well as more agreeable, to confine himself chiefly to the\r\ntask of attacking some \"great man in the present administration.\"\r\n\r\nIt ought to be said of Stanhope that he was distinctly in advance of\r\nhis age as regarded the recognition of the principle of religious\r\nequality.  He was not only anxious to put the Protestant Dissenters as\r\nmuch as possible on a level with Churchmen in all the privileges of\r\ncitizenship, but he was even strongly in favor of mitigating the\r\nseverity of the laws against the Roman Catholics.  In his \"History of\r\nEngland, from the Peace of Utrecht to the Peace of Versailles,\" Lord\r\nStanhope, the descendant of the minister whose career and character\r\nhave done so much honor to a name and a family, claims for him the\r\ncredit of having put on paper a scheme \"not undeserving of attention as\r\nthe earliest germ of Roman Catholic emancipation.\"  Stanhope's life was\r\ntoo soon and too {174} suddenly cut short to allow him to push forward\r\nhis scheme to anything like a practical position, and it is not\r\nprobable that he could in any case have done much with it at such a\r\ntime.  Still, though fate cut short the life, it ought not to cut short\r\nthe praise.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1719--The Peerage Bill]\r\n\r\nThe Peerage Bill raised a question of some constitutional importance.\r\nThe principal object of this measure, which was introduced on February\r\n28, 1719, in the House of Lords, by the Duke of Somerset, and was\r\nbelieved to have Lord Sunderland for its actual author, was to limit\r\nthe prerogative of the Crown in the creation of English peerages to a\r\nnumber not exceeding six, in addition to those already existing.\r\nAccording to the provisions of the Bill, the Crown might still create\r\nnew Peers on the extinction of old titles for want of male heirs; but\r\nwith this exception the power of adding new peerages would be limited\r\nto the number of six.  It was also proposed that, instead of the\r\nsixteen elective Peers from Scotland, twenty-five hereditary Peers\r\nshould be created.  This part of the Bill was that which at the time\r\ngave rise to most of the debate, in the House of Lords at least; but\r\nthe really important constitutional question was that which involved\r\nthe limitation of the privilege of the Sovereign.  The Sovereign\r\nhimself sent a special message to the House of Lords, informing them\r\nthat \"he has so much at heart the settling the Peerage of the whole\r\nkingdom upon such a foundation as may secure the freedom and\r\nconstitution of Parliament in all future ages, that he is willing that\r\nhis prerogative stand not in the way of so great and necessary a work.\"\r\nThe ostensible motive for the proposed legislation was to get rid of\r\ndifficulties caused by the over-increase of the numbers of the peerage\r\nsince the union of England and Scotland; the real object was to guard\r\nagainst such a _coup-d'état_ as that accomplished in Anne's later days\r\nby the creation of the twelve Peers, of whom Mrs. Masham's husband was\r\none.  Nothing could be more generous and liberal, it might have been\r\nthought, than the expressed willingness of the {175} King to surrender\r\na part of his prerogative.  This very readiness, however, expressed as\r\nit was by anticipation, and before the measure had yet made any\r\nprogress, set a great many persons in and out of Parliament thinking.\r\nA vehement dispute soon sprang up, in which the pamphleteer, as usual,\r\nbore an important part.  Addison, in one of his latest political and\r\nliterary efforts, defended the proposed change.  He described his\r\npamphlet as the work of an \"Old Whig.\"  It was written as a reply to a\r\npamphlet by Steele condemning the Bill, and signed \"A Plebeian.\"\r\nReply, retort, and rejoinder followed in more and more heated and\r\npersonal style.  The excitement created caused the measure to be\r\ndropped for the session, but it was brought in again in the session\r\nfollowing, and it passed through all its stages in the Lords without\r\ntrouble and with much rapidity.\r\n\r\nWhen it came down to the House of Commons, however, a very different\r\nfate awaited it.  Walpole assailed it with powerful eloquence and with\r\nunanswerable argument.  The true nature of the scheme now came out.  It\r\nwould have simply rendered the representative chamber powerless against\r\na majority of the chamber which did not represent.  This will be\r\nreadily apparent to any one who considers the subject for a moment by\r\nthe light of our more modern experience.  A majority of the House of\r\nCommons, representing, it may be, a vast majority of the people, agree\r\nto a certain measure.  It goes up to the House of Lords, and is\r\nrejected there.  What means in the end have the Commons, who represent\r\nthe nation, of giving effect to the wishes of the nation?  They have\r\nnone but the privilege of the Crown to create, under the advice of\r\nministers, a sufficient number of new Peers to outvote the opponents of\r\nthe measure.  No alternative but revolution and civil war would be left\r\nif this were taken away.  It is true that the power might be again\r\nabused by the Sovereign, as it was abused in Anne's days on the advice\r\nof the Tories; but we know that, as a matter of fact, it is hardly ever\r\nabused--hardly ever even used.  {176} Why is it hardly ever used?  For\r\nthe good reason that all men know it is existing, and can be used\r\nshould the need arise.  Even were it to be misused, the misuse would\r\nhappen under responsible ministers, who could be challenged to answer\r\nfor it, and who would have to make good their defence.  But if the\r\nHouse of Lords were made supreme over the House of Commons in every\r\ninstance, by abolishing the unlimited prerogative which alone keeps it\r\nin check, who could then be held responsible for abuse--and before\r\nwhom?  Who could call the House of Lords to account?  Before what\r\ntribunal could it be summoned to answer?  The Peers are now independent\r\nof the people, and would then be also independent of the Crown.  There\r\nis hardly a great political reform known to modern England which, if\r\nthe Peerage Bill had become law, would not have been absolutely\r\nrejected or else carried by a popular revolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1720--The Irish House of Lords]\r\n\r\nWalpole attacked the Bill on every side.  Such legislation, he\r\ninsisted, \"would in time bring back the Commons into the state of\r\nservile dependency they were in when they wore the badges of the\r\nLords.\"  It would, he contended, take away \"one of the most powerful\r\nincentives to virtue, . . . since there would be no coming to honor but\r\nthrough the winding-sheet of an old decrepit lord and the grave of an\r\nextinct noble family.\"  Walpole knew well his public and his time.  He\r\ndwelt most strongly on this last consideration--that the Bill if passed\r\ninto law would shut the gates of the Peerage against deserving\r\nCommoners.  He asked indignantly how the House of Lords could expect\r\nthe Commons to give their concurrence to a measure \"by which they and\r\ntheir posterities are to be excluded from the Peerage.\"  The commoner\r\nwho, after this way of putting the matter, assented to the Bill, must\r\neither have been an unambitious bachelor, or have been blessed in a\r\nsingularly unambitious wife.  Steele, who, as we have seen, had fought\r\ngallantly against the Bill with his pen, now made a very effective\r\nspeech against it.  He showed that the {177} measure would, alter the\r\nwhole constitutional position of the House of Lords, whether as a\r\nlegislative chamber or a court of appeal.  \"The restraint of the Peers\r\nto a certain number will make the most powerful of them have all the\r\nrest under their direction, . . . and judges so made by the blind order\r\nof birth will be capable of no other way of decision.\"  The\r\nprerogative, as Steele put it very clearly, \"can do no hurt when\r\nministers do their duty; but a settled number of Peers may abuse their\r\npower when no man is answerable for them, or can call them to account\r\nfor their encroachments.\"  The Bill was rejected by a majority of 269\r\nvotes against 177.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1720, was passed an Act with a pompous and even portentous\r\ntitle: it was called \"An Act for the better securing the Dependency of\r\nthe Kingdom of Ireland upon the Crown of Great Britain.\"  The preamble\r\nrecited that \"attempts have been lately made to shake off the\r\nsubjection of Ireland unto and dependence upon the Imperial Crown of\r\nthis realm, which will be of dangerous consequence to Great Britain and\r\nIreland.\"  The reader would naturally assume that some fresh designs of\r\nthe Stuarts had been discovered, having for their theatre the Catholic\r\nprovinces of Ireland.  Was James Stuart about to land at Kinsale?  Had\r\nAlberoni got hold of the Irish Catholics?  Was Atterbury plotting with\r\nSwift for an armed insurrection in Munster and Connaught?  No; nothing\r\nof the kind was expected.  The preamble of the alarming Act went on to\r\nset forth that the House of Lords in Ireland had lately, \"against law,\r\nassumed to themselves a power and jurisdiction to examine, correct, and\r\namend the judgments and decrees of the courts of justice in the kingdom\r\nof Ireland;\" and this alleged trespass of the Irish House of Lords was\r\nthe whole cause of the new measure.  The Act declared that the Irish\r\nHouse of Lords had no jurisdiction \"to judge of, affirm, or reverse any\r\njudgment, sentence, or decree given or made in any court within the\r\nsaid kingdom.\"  This was an enactment of the most serious {178} moment\r\nin a constitutional sense.  It made the Parliament of Ireland\r\nsubordinate to the Parliament of England; it reduced the Irish House of\r\nLords from a position in Ireland equal to that of the House of Lords in\r\nEngland, down to the level of a mere provincial assembly.  The occasion\r\nof the passing of this Act was the decision given by the Irish House of\r\nLords in the celebrated cause of Sherlock against Annesley.  It is not\r\nnecessary for us to go into the story of the case at any length.  It\r\nwas a question of disputed property.  The defendant had obtained a\r\ndecree in the Irish Court of Exchequer, which decree was reversed on an\r\nappeal to the Irish House of Lords.  The defendant appealed to the\r\nEnglish House of Lords, who confirmed the judgment of the Irish Court\r\nof Exchequer, and ordered him to be put in possession of the disputed\r\nproperty.  The Irish House of Lords stood by their authority, and\r\nactually ordered the Irish Barons of Exchequer to be taken into custody\r\nby Black Rod for having offended against the privileges of the Peers\r\nand the rights and liberties of Ireland.  The Act was passed to settle\r\nthe question and reduce the Irish House of Lords to submission and\r\nsubordinate rank.  It was settled merely, of course, by the strength of\r\na majority in the English Parliament.  The Duke of Leeds recorded a\r\nsensible and a manly protest against the vote of the majority of his\r\nbrother Peers.  One or two of the reasons he gives for his protest are\r\nworth reading even now.  The eleventh reason is, \"Because it is the\r\nglory of the English laws and the blessing attending Englishmen, that\r\nthey have justice administered at their doors, and not to be drawn, as\r\nformerly, to Rome by appeals;\" \"and by this order the people of Ireland\r\nmust be drawn from Ireland hither whensoever they receive any injustice\r\nfrom the Chancery there, by which means poor men must be trampled on,\r\nas not being able to come over to seek for justice.\"  The thirteenth\r\nreason is still more concise: \"Because this taking away the\r\njurisdiction of the Lords' House in Ireland may be a means to {179}\r\ndisquiet the Lords there and disappoint the King's affairs.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1718--Death of William Penn]\r\n\r\nThe protest, it need hardly be said, received little or no attention.\r\nMore than sixty years after, when England was perplexed in foreign and\r\ncolonial troubles, the spirit of the protest walked abroad and animated\r\nGrattan and the Irish Volunteers.  But in 1720 the Parliament at\r\nWestminster was free to do as it pleased with the Parliament in Dublin.\r\nTo the vast majority of the Irish people it might have been a matter of\r\nabsolute indifference which Parliament reigned supreme; they had as\r\nlittle to expect from Dublin as from Westminster.  The Irish Parliament\r\nwas quite as ready to promote legislation for the further persecution\r\nof Catholics as any English Parliament could be.  The Parliament in\r\nDublin was merely an assembly of English and Protestant colonists.  Yet\r\nit is worthy of remark, that, then and after, the sympathies of the\r\npeople, when they had any means of showing them, went with the Irish\r\nParliament simply because of the name it bore.  It was, at all events,\r\nthe so-called Parliament of Ireland; it represented, at least in name,\r\nthe authority of the Irish people.  So long as it existed there was\r\nsome recognition of the fact that Ireland was something more than a\r\nmerely conquered country, held by the title of the sword, and governed\r\nby arbitrary proclamation, secret warrant, and drum-head court-martial.\r\n\r\nDeath had been busy among eminent men for some few years.  The Duke of\r\nShrewsbury, the \"king of hearts,\" the statesman whose appointment as\r\nLord Treasurer secured the throne of Great Britain for the Hanoverian\r\nfamily, died on February 18, 1717.  William Penn, the founder of the\r\ngreat American State of Pennyslvania, closed his long active and\r\nfruitful life in 1718.  We have here only to record his death; the\r\nhistory of his deeds belongs to an earlier time.  Controversy has now\r\nquite ceased to busy itself about his noble character, and his life of\r\nsplendid unostentatious beneficence.  His name, which without his\r\nconsent and against his wishes was {180} made part of the name of the\r\nState which he founded, will be remembered in connection with its\r\nhistory while the Delaware and the Schuylkill flow.  Of his famous\r\ntreaty with the Indians nothing, perhaps, was ever better said than the\r\ncomment of Voltaire, that it was the only league between savages and\r\nwhite men which was never sworn to and never broken.  Addison died,\r\nstill comparatively young, on June 17, 1719.  He had reached the\r\nhighest point of his political career but a short time before, when, on\r\none of the changes of office between Stanhope and Sunderland, he became\r\none of the principal secretaries of State.  His health, however, was\r\nbreaking down, and he never had indeed the slightest gift or taste for\r\npolitical life.  \"Pity,\" said Mrs. Manley, the authoress of \"The New\r\nAtlantis,\" speaking of Addison, \"that politics and sordid interest\r\nshould have carried him out of the road of Helicon and snatched him\r\nfrom the embraces of the Muses.\"  But it seems quite unjust to ascribe\r\nAddison's divergence into political ways to any sordid interest.  He\r\nhad political friends who loved him, and he went with them into\r\npolitics as he might have travelled in company with them, and for the\r\nsake of their company, although caring nothing for travel himself.  No\r\nman was better aware of his incapacity for the real business of public\r\nlife.  Addison had himself pointed out all the objections to his\r\npolitical advancement before that advancement was pressed upon him.  He\r\nwas not a statesman; he was not an administrator; he could not do any\r\ngenuine service as head of a department; he was not even a good clerk;\r\nhe was a wretched speaker; he was consumed by a morbid shyness, almost\r\nas oppressive as that of the poet Cowper in a later day, or of\r\nNathaniel Hawthorne, the American novelist, later still.  His whole\r\npublic career was at best but a harmless mistake.  It has done no harm\r\nto his literary fame.  The world has almost forgotten it.  Even lovers\r\nof Addison might have to be reminded now that the creator of Sir Roger\r\nde Coverley was once a diplomatic agent and a secretary of State, {181}\r\nand a member of the House of Commons.  Some of the essays which Addison\r\ncontributed to the _Spectator_ are like enough to outlive the system of\r\ngovernment by party, and perhaps even the whole system of\r\nrepresentative government.  Sir Roger de Coverley will not be forgotten\r\nuntil men forget Parson Adams and Robinson Crusoe and Gil Blas, and for\r\nthat matter, Sir John Falstaff and Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1720--The King and the Prince reconciled]\r\n\r\nFor some time things were looking well at home and abroad.  The policy\r\nof the Government appeared to have been completely successful on the\r\nContinent.  The confederations that had been threatening England were\r\ndissolved or broken up; the Jacobite conspiracies seemed to have been\r\nmade hopeless and powerless.  The friendship established between\r\nEngland and the Regent of France had to all seeming robbed the Stuarts\r\nof their last chance.  James the Chevalier had no longer a home on\r\nFrench soil.  Paris could not any more be the head-quarters of his\r\norganization and the scene of his mock Court.  The Regent had kept his\r\npromises to the English Government.  It was well known that, so far\r\nfrom encouraging or permitting the designs of the exiled family against\r\nEngland, he would do all in his power to frustrate them; as, indeed, he\r\nhad an opportunity of doing not long after.  Never before, perhaps\r\nnever since, was there so cordial an understanding between England and\r\nFrance.  Never could there have been a time when such an understanding\r\nwas of greater importance to England.\r\n\r\nAt home the prospect seemed equally bright.  Walpole had contrived to\r\ningratiate himself more and more with the Prince of Wales, and had\r\nbecome his confidential adviser.  Acting on his counsel, the Prince\r\nmade his submission to the King; and acting on Stanhope's counsel, the\r\nKing accepted it.  The Sovereign and his heir had a meeting and were\r\nreconciled; for the time, at least.  Walpole consented to join the\r\nadministration, content for the present to fill the humble place of\r\npaymaster to the forces, without a seat in the Cabinet.  He returned,\r\nin {182} fact, to the ministerial position which he had first occupied,\r\nand from which he had been promoted, and must have seemed to himself\r\nsomewhat in the position of a boy who, after having got high in his\r\nclass, has got down very low again, and is well content to mount up a\r\nstep or two from the humblest position.  Walpole knew what he was\r\ndoing, and must have been quite satisfied in his own mind that he was\r\nnot likely to remain very long paymaster to the forces, although he\r\ncould not, by any possibility, have anticipated the strange succession\r\nof events by which he was destined soon to be left without a rival.\r\nFor the present he was in the administration, but he took little part\r\nin its actual work.  He did not even appear to have any real concern in\r\nit.  He spent as much of his time as he could at Houghton, his pleasant\r\ncountry-seat in Norfolk.  Townshend, too, had been induced to join the\r\nadministration.  To him was assigned the position of president of the\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\nThus there appeared to be a truce to quarrels, and to enmities abroad\r\nand at home.  There was no dispute with any of the great Continental\r\npowers; there was no dread of the Stuarts.  Ministerial rivalries had\r\nbeen reduced to concordance and quiet; the traditional quarrel between\r\nthe Sovereign and the heir-apparent had been composed.  It might have\r\nbeen thought that a time of peace and national prosperity had been\r\nassured.  In the history of nations, however, we commonly find that\r\nnothing more certainly bodes unsettlement than a general conviction\r\nthat everything is settled forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{183}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\"THE EARTH HATH BUBBLES.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1718-1719--The Mississippi Scheme]\r\n\r\nOne of the comedies of Ben Jonson gives some vivid and humorous\r\nillustrations of the mania for projects, speculations, patents, and\r\nmonopolies that at his time had taken possession of the minds of\r\nEnglishmen.  There is an enterprising person who declares that he can\r\ncoin money out of cobwebs, raise wool upon egg-shells, and make grass\r\ngrow out of marrow-bones.  He has a project \"for the recovery of drowned\r\nland,\" a scheme for a new patent for the dressing of dog-skins for\r\ngloves, a plan for the bottling of ale, a device for making wine out of\r\nblackberries, and various other schemes cut and dry for what would now be\r\ncalled floating companies to make money.  The civilized world is visited\r\nwith this epidemic of project and speculation from time to time.  In the\r\nreign of George the First such a mania attacked England much more\r\nfiercely than it had done even in the days of Ben Jonson.  It came to us\r\nthis time from France.  The close of a great war is always a tempting and\r\na favorable time for such enterprises.  Finances are out of order; a\r\nseason of spurious commercial activity has come to an end; new resources\r\nare to be sought for somehow; and man must change to be other than he is\r\nwhen he wholly ceases to believe in financial miracle-working.  There is\r\nan air of plausibility about most of the new projects; and, indeed, like\r\nthe scheme told of in Ben Jonson for the recovery of drowned lands, the\r\nenterprise is usually something within human power to accomplish, if only\r\nhuman skill could make it pay.  The exchequer of France had been brought\r\ninto a condition of something very like {184} bankruptcy by the long and\r\nwasting war; and a projector was found who promised to supply the\r\ndeficiency as boldly and as liberally as Mephistopheles does in the\r\nsecond part of \"Faust.\"  John Law, a Scotchman, and unquestionably a man\r\nof great ability and financial skill, had settled in France in\r\nconsequence of having fought a duel and killed his man in his own\r\ncountry.  [Sidenote: 1710-1720--The South Sea Company] Law set up a\r\ncompany which was to have a monopoly of the trade of the whole\r\nMississippi region in North America, and on condition of the monopoly was\r\nto pay off the national debt of France.  A scheme of the kind within due\r\nlimitations would have been reasonable enough, so far as the working of\r\nthe Mississippi region was concerned; but Law went on extending and\r\nextending the scope of its supposed operations, until it might almost as\r\nwell have attempted to fold in the orb of the earth.  The shares in his\r\ncompany went up with a sudden bound.  He had the patronage of the Regent\r\nand of all the Court circle.  Gambling in shares became the fashion, the\r\npassion of Paris, and, indeed, of all France.  Shares bought one day were\r\nsold at an immense advance the next, or even the same day.  Men and women\r\nnearly bankrupt in purse before, suddenly found themselves in possession\r\nof large sums of money, for which they had to all appearance run no risk\r\nand made no sacrifice whatever.  Princes and tradesmen, duchesses and\r\nseamstresses and harlots, clamored, intrigued, and battled for shares.\r\nThe offices in the Rue Quincampoix, a street then inhabited by bankers,\r\nstock-brokers, and exchange agents, were besieged all day long with\r\ncrowds of eager competitors for shares.  The street was choked with fine\r\nequipages, until it was found absolutely necessary to close it against\r\nall horses and carriages.  All the rank and fashion of Paris flung itself\r\ninto this game of speculation.  Every one has heard the story of the\r\nhunchback who made a little fortune by the letting of his hump as a desk\r\non which impatient speculators might scribble their applications for\r\nshares.  A French novelist, M. Paul Feval, has made good use of {185}\r\nthis story, and London still remembers to what a brilliant dramatic\r\naccount it was turned by Mr. Fechter.  Law was the most powerful and the\r\nmost courted man of his day.  In his youth he had been a gallant and a\r\nfree liver, a man of dress and fashion and intrigue, who delighted in\r\nscandalous entanglements with women.  The fashion and beauty of Paris was\r\nfor the hour at his feet.  Think of a brilliant gallant who could make\r\none rich in a moment!  The mother of the Regent described in a coarse and\r\npungent sentence the sort of homage which Parisian ladies would have been\r\nwilling to pay to Law if he had so desired.  St. Simon, the mere\r\n_littérateur_ and diplomatist, kept his head almost alone, and was not to\r\nbe dazzled.  Since the fable of Midas, he said, he had not heard of any\r\none having the power to turn all he touched into gold, and he did not\r\nbelieve that virtue was given to M. Law.  There is no doubt that Law was\r\na man of great ability as a financier, and that his scheme in the\r\nbeginning had promise in it.  It was, as Burke has said of the scheme and\r\nits author, the public enthusiasm, and not Law himself, which chose to\r\nbuild on the base of his scheme a structure which it could not bear.  It\r\ndoes not seem by any means certain that a project quite as wild might not\r\nbe launched in London or Paris at the present day, and find almost as\r\ngreat a temporary success, and blaze, like Law's, the comet of a season.\r\nWhile the season lasted the comet blazed with a light that filled the\r\nsocial sky.\r\n\r\nLaw was for the time the most powerful man in France.  A momentary\r\nwhisper that he was out of health sent the funds down, and eclipsed the\r\ngayety of nations.  He was admitted into the Regent's privy council, and\r\nmade Controller-general of the finances of France.  The result was\r\ninevitable; there was as yet nothing behind the promises and the shares\r\nof the Mississippi Company.  If finance could have gone on forever\r\npromise-crammed, things would have been all right.  But you cannot feed\r\ncapons so, as Hamlet tells us; and you cannot long feed {186}\r\nshareholders so.  Law's scheme suddenly collapsed one day, and brought\r\nruin on hundreds of thousands in France.  While, however, it was still\r\nafloat in air, its gaudy colors dazzled the eyes of the South Sea Company\r\nin England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1710-1720--The bubble swells]\r\n\r\nAt the north-west end of Threadneedle Street, within view of the remains\r\nof Richard the Third's Palace of Crosby, stands a solid red-brick\r\nbuilding, substantial, respectable, business-like, dignified with the\r\ndignity of some century and a half of existence.  Time has softened and\r\ndeepened its ruddy hue to a mellow, rich tone, contrasting pleasantly\r\nwith the white copings and facings of its windows, and suggesting\r\nagreeably something of the smooth brown cloth and neat white linen of a\r\nwell-to-do city gentleman of the last century.  Yet that solemn, massive,\r\nprosperous-looking building is the enduring monument of one of the most\r\ngigantic shams on record--a sham and swindle that was the prolific parent\r\nof a whole brood of shams and swindles; for that building, with honesty\r\nand credit and mercantile honor written in its every line and angle, is\r\nall that remains of the South Sea House.  It is a melancholy place--the\r\nHall of the Kings at Karnak is hardly more melancholy or more\r\nghost-haunted.  Not that the house has now that \"desolation something\r\nlike Balclutha's\" which Charles Lamb attributed to it more than half a\r\ncentury ago.  The place has changed greatly since Elia the Italian and\r\nElia the Englishman were fellow-clerks at the South Sea House.  Those\r\ndusty maps of Mexico, \"dim as dreams,\" have long been taken away.  The\r\ncompany itself, having outlived alike its fame and its infamy, lingering\r\ninappropriately like some guest that \"hath outstayed his welcome time,\"\r\nwas wound up at last within the memory of living men.  The stately\r\ngate-way no longer opens upon the \"grave court, with cloisters and\r\npillars,\" where South Sea stock so often changed hands.  The cloisters\r\nand pillars have gone; the court has been converted into a hall of a sort\r\nof exchange, where merchants daily meet.  The days of the desolation of\r\nthe South Sea House are as much a thing of its past as {187} its earlier\r\nsplendor.  Its corridors are now crowded with offices occupied by\r\nmerchants of every nationality, from Scotland to Greece, and by companies\r\nconnected with every portion of the globe.  Only at night, on Saturday\r\nafternoons, and during the still peace of a City Sabbath, do the noise of\r\nmen and the stir of business cease in the South Sea House.  Yet,\r\nnevertheless, when one thinks of all that has happened there, of the\r\ndreams and hopes and miseries of which it was the begetter, it remains\r\none of the most melancholy temples to folly that man has yet erected.\r\n\r\nThe South Sea Company had been established in 1710 by Harley himself, and\r\nwas going along quietly and soberly enough for the time; but the example\r\nof the Mississippi Company was too strong for it.  The South Sea Company,\r\ntoo, made to itself waxen wings, and prepared to fly above the clouds.\r\nThe directors offered to relieve the State of its debt on condition of\r\nobtaining a monopoly of the South Sea trade.  The nation was to take\r\nshares in the company in the first instance, and to deal with the\r\ncompany, for its commercial and other wares, in the second; and by means\r\nof the exclusive dealing in shares and in products it was to pay off the\r\nNational Debt.  In other words, three men, all having nothing, and\r\nheavily in debt, were to go into exclusive dealings with each other, and\r\nwere thus to make fortunes, discharge their liabilities, and live in\r\nluxury for the rest of their days.  Stated thus, the proposition looks\r\nmarvellously absurd.  But it is not, in its essential conditions, more\r\nabsurd than many a financial project which floats successfully for a\r\ntime.  Money-making, the hardest and most practical of all occupations,\r\nthe task which can soonest be tested by results, is the business of all\r\nothers in which men are most easily led astray, most greedy to be led\r\nastray.  Sydney Smith speaks of a certain French lady whose whole nature\r\ncried out for her seduction.  There are seasons when the whole nature of\r\nman seems to cry out for his financial seduction.  The South Sea project\r\nexpanded and inflated as the {188} Mississippi Scheme had done.  Its\r\ntemporary success turned the heads of the whole population.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1720--The bank competes]\r\n\r\nHundreds of schemes, still more wild, sprang into sudden existence.  Some\r\nof the projects then put forward, and believed in, surpass in senseless\r\nextravagance anything satirized by Ben Jonson.  So wild was the passion\r\nfor new enterprises, that it seemed as if, at one time, anybody had only\r\nto announce any scheme, however preposterous, in order to find people\r\ncompeting for shares in it.  The only condition of things in our own time\r\nthat could be compared with this epoch of insane speculation is the\r\nrailway mania of 1846, when, for a brief season, George Hudson was king,\r\nand set up his hat in the market-place, and all England bowed down in\r\nhomage to it.  But the epidemic of speculation in the reign of the\r\nrailway king was comparatively harmless and reasonable when compared with\r\nthe midsummer madness of the South Sea scheme.\r\n\r\nThe South Sea scheme was brought before the notice of the House of\r\nCommons in 1720.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer was Mr. Aislabie.  We\r\nhave already seen Mr. Aislabie as one of the secret committee who\r\nrecommended the impeachment of Oxford and Bolingbroke.  How well he was\r\nfitted for his office will appear from the fact that he was altogether\r\ntaken in by the project, and by the financial arguments of those who\r\nbrought it forward.  Sunderland and Stanhope were taken in likewise--but\r\nthere was nothing very surprising in that.  A statesman of those days did\r\nnot profess to understand anything about finance or economics, unless\r\nthese subjects happened to belong to his department; and the statesman\r\nwas exceptional who could honestly profess to understand them even when\r\nthey did.  Walpole, however, was a minister of a different order.  He was\r\nthe first of the line of statesmen-financiers.  He saw through the\r\nbubble, and endeavored to make others see as clearly as he did himself.\r\nWalpole assailed the project in a pamphlet, and opposed it strenuously in\r\nhis place in Parliament.  He was {189} not at that time a minister of the\r\nCrown; perhaps, if he had been, the South Sea Bill might never have been\r\npresented to Parliament; but the nation and the Parliament were off their\r\nheads just then.  The caricaturists and the authors of lampoon verses\r\npositively found out the South Sea scheme before the financiers and men\r\nof the city.\r\n\r\nOn January 22, 1720, the House of Commons, sitting in what was then\r\ntermed a Grand Committee, or what would now be called Committee of the\r\nwhole House, took into consideration a proposal of the South Sea Company\r\ntowards the redemption of the public debts.  The proposal set forth that,\r\n\"the Corporation of the Governor and Company of Merchants of Great\r\nBritain, trading to the South Sea and other parts of America, and for\r\nencouraging the fishery, having under their consideration how they may be\r\nmost serviceable to his Majesty and his Government, and to show their\r\nzeal and readiness to concur in the great and honorable design of\r\nreducing the national debts,\" do \"humbly apprehend that if the public\r\ndebts and annuities mentioned in the annexed estimate were taken into and\r\nmade part of the capital stock of the said Company, it would greatly\r\ncontribute to that most desirable end.\"  The Company then set forth the\r\nconditions under which they proposed to convert themselves into an agency\r\nfor paying off the national debt, and making a profit for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe proposal fell somewhat short of the general expectation, which looked\r\nfor nothing less than a sort of financial philosopher's stone.  Besides,\r\nthe Bank of England was willing to compete with the South Sea Company.\r\nIf the Company could coin money out of cobwebs, why should not the Bank\r\nbe able to accomplish the same feat?  The friends of the Bank reminded\r\nthe House of Commons of the great services which that corporation had\r\nrendered to the Government in the most difficult times, and urged, with\r\nmuch show of justice, that if any advantage was to be made by public\r\nbargains, the Bank should be preferred before a Company that had never\r\n{190} done anything for the nation.  Well might Aislabie, the unfortunate\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, whose shame and ruin we shall soon come to\r\ntell of, exclaim in the speech which he made when defending himself for\r\nthe second time before the House of Lords, that \"the spirit of bubbling\r\nhad prevailed so universally that the very Bank became a bubble--and this\r\nnot by chance or necessity, or from any engagement to raise money for the\r\npublic service, but from the same spirit that actuated Temple Mills or\r\nCaraway's Fishery.\"  In plain truth, as poor Aislabie pointed out, the\r\nBank started a scheme in imitation of the South Sea Company, and the\r\nHouse of Commons gave time for its proper development.  The Bank offered\r\nits scheme on February 1st, and by that time the South Sea Company had\r\nseen their way to mend their hand and submit more attractive proposals.\r\nThen the Bank, not to be out-rivalled, soon made a second proposal as\r\nwell.  The House took the rival propositions into consideration.  Walpole\r\nwas the chief advocate of the Bank.  No doubt he had come to the\r\nreasonable conclusion that if there could be any hope of success for such\r\na scheme, it would be found in the Bank of England rather than in the\r\nSouth Sea Company.  Mr. Aislabie, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, made\r\nhimself the champion of the Company, and assured the House that its\r\npropositions were of far greater advantage to the country than those of\r\nthe Bank.  Under his persuasive influence the House agreed to accept the\r\ntender, as we may call it, of the Company, and the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, Mr. Secretary Craggs, and others, were ordered to prepare and\r\nbring in a bill to give legislative sanction to the scheme.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1720--The Bill passed]\r\n\r\nThe bill passed the Commons and went up to the House of Lords.  To the\r\ncredit of the Peers it has to be said that they received it more\r\ndoubtfully, and were slower to admit the certainty of its blessings than\r\nthe members of the representative chamber had been.  Lord North and Gray\r\ncondemned it as not only making way for, but {191} actually countenancing\r\nand authorizing \"the fraudulent and pernicious practice of\r\nstock-jobbing.\"  The Duke of Wharton declared that \"the artificial and\r\nprodigious rise of the South Sea stock was a dangerous bait, which might\r\ndecoy many unwary people to their ruin, and allure them, by a false\r\nprospect of gain, to part with what they had got by their labor and\r\nindustry to purchase imaginary riches.\"  Lord Cowper said that the bill,\r\n\"like the Trojan horse, was ushered in and received with great pomp and\r\nacclamations of joy, but was contrived for treachery and destruction.\"\r\nLord Sunderland, however, spoke warmly in favor of the bill, and\r\ncontended that \"they who countenanced the scheme of the South Sea Company\r\nhad nothing in their view but the easing the nation of part of that heavy\r\nload of debt it labored under;\" and argued that the scheme would enable\r\nthe directors of the Company at once to pay off the debt, and to secure\r\nlarge dividends to their share-holders.  The Lords decided on admitting\r\nthe South Sea Company's Trojan horse.  Eighty-three votes were in favor\r\nof the bill, and only seventeen against it.  The bill was read a third\r\ntime on April 7th, and received the Royal assent on June 11th.  The\r\nKing's speech, delivered that day at the close of the session, declared\r\nthat \"the good foundation you have prepared this session for the payment\r\nof the national debts, and the discharge of a great part of them without\r\nthe least violation of the public faith, will, I hope, strengthen more\r\nand more the union I desire to see among all my subjects, and make our\r\nfriendship yet more valuable to all foreign Powers.\"\r\n\r\nThe immediate result of the Parliamentary authority thus given to what\r\nwas purely a bubble scheme was to bring upon the Legislature a perfect\r\ndeluge of petitions from all manner of projectors.  Patents and\r\nmonopolies were sought for the carrying on of fisheries in Greenland and\r\nvarious other regions; for the growth, manufacture and sale of hemp,\r\nflax, and cotton; for the making of sail-cloth; for a general insurance\r\nagainst fire; for the {192} planting and rearing of madder to be used by\r\ndyers; for the preparing and curing of Virginia tobacco for snuff, and\r\nmaking it into the same within all his Majesty's dominions.  Schemes such\r\nas these were comparatively reasonable; but there were others of a\r\ndifferent kind.  Petitions were gravely submitted to Parliament praying\r\nfor patents to be granted to the projectors of enterprises for trading in\r\nhair; for the universal supply of funerals to all parts of Great Britain;\r\nfor insuring and increasing children's fortunes; for insuring masters and\r\nmistresses against losses from the carelessness or misconduct of\r\nservants; for insuring against thefts and robberies; for extracting\r\nsilver from lead; for the transmutation of silver into malleable fine\r\nmetal; for buying and fitting out ships to suppress pirates; for a wheel\r\nfor perpetual motion, and--with which project, perhaps, we may close our\r\nlist of specimens--\"for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage,\r\nbut nobody to know what it is.\"  Of course some of these projects were\r\nmere vulgar swindles.  Even in that season of marvellous projection it is\r\nnot to be supposed that the inventors of the last-mentioned scheme had\r\nany serious belief in its efficacy.  The author of the project for the\r\nperpetual-motion wheel was, we take it, a sincere personage and\r\nenthusiast.  His scheme has been coming up again and again before the\r\nworld since his time; and we have known good men who would have staked\r\nall they held dear in life upon the possibility of its realization.  But\r\nthe would-be patentee of the undertaking of great advantage, nobody to\r\nknow what it is, was a man of a different order.  He understood human\r\nnature in certain of its moods.  He knew that there are men and women who\r\ncan be got to believe in anything which holds out the promise of quick\r\nand easy gain.  If he found a few dozen greedy and selfish fools to help\r\nhis project with a little money, that would, no doubt, be the full\r\nattainment of his ends.  Probably he was successful.  The very boldness\r\nof his avowal of secrecy would have a charm for many.  One day would be\r\nenough for him--the {193} the day when he sent in his demand for a\r\npatent.  The bare demand would bring him dupes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1720--The bubble bursts]\r\n\r\nThe first great blow struck at the South Sea Company came from the South\r\nSea Company itself.  Several bubble companies began to imitate the\r\nfinancial system which the more favored institution had set up.  The\r\nSouth Sea Company put in motion certain legal proceedings against some of\r\nthe offenders.  The South Sea Company had the support and countenance of\r\nthe high legal authorities, and found no difficulty in obtaining\r\ninjunctions against the other associations, directing them not to go\r\nbeyond the strict legal privileges secured to them by their charters of\r\nincorporation.  Among the undertakings thus admonished were the English\r\nCopper Company and the Welsh Copper and Lead Company.  His Royal Highness\r\nthe Prince of Wales happened to be a governor of the English Copper\r\nCompany, and the Lords-justices were polite enough to send the Prince a\r\nmessage expressing the great regret they felt at having to declare\r\nillegal an enterprise with which he was connected.  The Prince, not to be\r\noutdone in politeness, received the admonition, we are told, \"very\r\ngraciously,\" and sent on his part a message to the Company requesting\r\nthem to accept his resignation, and to elect some one else a governor in\r\nhis place.  The proceedings which the South Sea Company had set on foot\r\nagainst their audacious rivals and imitators had, however, the\r\ninconvenient effect of directing too much of public attention to the\r\nprinciples upon which they conducted their own business.  Confidence\r\nbegan to waver, to be shaken, to give way altogether; and when people ask\r\nwhether a speculation is a bubble, the bubble, if it is one, is already\r\nburst.\r\n\r\nThe whole basis of Law's system, and of the South Sea Company's schemes\r\nas well, was the principle that the prosperity of a nation is increased\r\nin proportion to the quantity of money in circulation; and that as no\r\nState can have gold enough for all its commercial transactions,\r\npaper-money may be issued to an unlimited extent, and {194} its full\r\nvalue maintained without its being convertible at pleasure into hard\r\ncash.  This supposed principle has been proved again and again to be a\r\nmere fallacy and paradox; but it always finds enthusiastic believers who\r\nhave plausible arguments in its support.  It appears, indeed, to have a\r\nsingular fascination for some persons in all times and communities.  It\r\nmight seem an obvious truism that under no possible conditions can people\r\nin general be got to give as much for a promise to pay as for a certain\r\nand instant payment; and yet this truism would have to be proved a\r\nfalsehood in order to establish a basis for such a project as that of\r\nLaw.  Even were the basis to be established, the project would then have\r\nto be worked fairly and honestly out, which was not done either in the\r\ncase of the Mississippi Company or of the South Sea Company.  If each had\r\nbeen founded on a true financial principle, each was worked in a false\r\nand fraudulent way.  At its best the South Sea Company in its later\r\ndevelopment would have been a bubble.  Worked as it actually was, it\r\nproved to be a swindle.  A committee of secrecy was appointed by the\r\nHouse of Commons to inquire into the condition of the Company.  The\r\ncommittee found that false and fictitious entries had been made in the\r\nCompany's books; that leaves had been torn out; that some books had been\r\ndestroyed altogether, and that others had been carried off and secreted.\r\nThe vulgar arts of the card-sharper and the thimble-rigger had been\r\nprodigally employed to avert detection and ruin by the directors of a\r\nCompany which was promoted and protected by ministers of State and by the\r\nfavorites of the King.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1720--Houghton]\r\n\r\nSome idea of the wide-spread nature of the disaster which was inflicted\r\nby the wreck of the Company may be formed from a rapid glance at some of\r\nthe petitions for redress and relief which were presented to the House of\r\nCommons.  We find among them petitions from the counties of Hertford,\r\nDorset, Essex, Buckingham, Derby; the cities of Bristol, Exeter, Lincoln;\r\nthe boroughs of Oakhampton, Amersham, Bedford, Chipping Wycombe, {195}\r\nAbingdon, Sudbury, East Retford, Evesham, Newark-upon-Trent, Newbury, and\r\nmany other places.  We have purposely omitted to take account of any of\r\nthe London communities.  The wildest excitement prevailed; and it is\r\ncharacteristic of the time to note that the national calamity--for it was\r\nno less--aroused fresh hopes in the minds of the Jacobites.  Such a\r\ncalamity, such a scandal, it was thought, could not but bring shame and\r\nruin upon the Whig ministers, and through them discredit on the Sovereign\r\nand the Court.  It was believed, it was hoped, that Sunderland would be\r\nfound to be implicated in the swindle.  Why should not such a crisis,\r\nsuch a humiliation to the Whigs, be the occasion of a new and a more\r\nsuccessful attempt on the part of the Jacobites?  The King was again in\r\nHanover.  He was summoned home in hot haste.  On December 8, 1720, the\r\ntwo Houses of Parliament were assembled to hear the reading of the Royal\r\nspeech proroguing the session; and in the speech the King was made to\r\nexpress his concern \"for the unhappy turn of affairs which has so much\r\naffected the public credit at home,\" and to recommend most earnestly to\r\nthe House of Commons \"that you consider of the most effectual and speedy\r\nmethods to restore the national credit, and fix it upon a lasting\r\nfoundation.\"  \"You will, I doubt not,\" the speech went on to say, \"be\r\nassisted in so commendable and necessary a work by every man that loves\r\nhis country.\"  A week or so before the Royal speech was read, on November\r\n30, 1720, Charles Edward, eldest son of James Stuart, was born at Rome.\r\nThe undaunted mettle of Atterbury came into fresh and vigorous activity\r\nwith the birth of the Stuart heir, and the apparently imminent ruin of\r\nthe Whig ministers.\r\n\r\nRobert Walpole had been spending some time peacefully at his country\r\nplace, Houghton, in Norfolk.  Hunting, bull-baiting, and drinking were\r\nthe principal amusements with which Walpole entertained his guests there.\r\nSometimes the guests were persons of royal rank (Walpole once entertained\r\nthe Grand Duke of Tuscany); {196} sometimes the throng of his visitors\r\nand his neighbors to the hunting-field could only be compared, says a\r\nletter written at the time, to an army in its march.  Walpole never lost\r\nsight, however, of what was going on in the metropolis.  He used to send\r\na trusty Norfolk man as his express-messenger to run all the way on foot\r\nfrom Houghton to London, and carry letters for him to confidential\r\nfriends, and bring him back the answers.  When he found how badly things\r\nwere going in London on the bursting of the South Sea bubble, he hastened\r\nup to town.  His presence was sadly needed there.  It is not without\r\ninterest to think of James Stuart in Rome, and Walpole in Houghton, both\r\nkeeping their eyes fixed on the gradual exposure of the South Sea\r\nswindle, and both alike hoping to find their account in the national\r\ncalamity.  All the advantage was with the statesman and not with the\r\nPrince.  The English people of all opinions and creeds were tolerably\r\nwell assured that if any one could help them out of the difficulty\r\nWalpole could; and it required the faith of the most devoted Jacobite to\r\nmake any man of business believe that the return of the exiled Stuarts\r\ncould do much to keep off national bankruptcy.  Walpole had waited long.\r\nHis time was now come at last.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1720--The Craggses]\r\n\r\nWalpole had kept his head cool during the days when the Company was\r\nsoaring to the skies; he kept his head equally cool when it came down\r\nwith a crash.  \"He had never,\" he said in the House of Commons, \"approved\r\nof the South Sea scheme, and was sensible it had done a great deal of\r\nmischief; but, since it could not be undone, he thought it the duty of\r\nall good men to give their helping hand towards retrieving it; and with\r\nthis view he had already bestowed some thoughts on a proposal to restore\r\npublic credit, which at the proper time he would submit to the wisdom of\r\nthe House.\"  Walpole had made money by the South Sea scheme.  The sound\r\nknowledge of the principles of finance, which enabled him to see that the\r\nenterprise thus conducted could not pay, in the end {197} enabled him\r\nalso to see that it could pay up to a certain point; and when that point\r\nhad been reached he quietly sold out and saved his gains.  The King's\r\nmistresses and their relatives also made good profit out of the\r\ntransactions.  The Prince of Wales was a gainer by some of the season's\r\nspeculations.  But when the crash came, the ruin was wide-spread; it\r\namounted to the proportions of a national calamity.  The ruling classes\r\nraged and stormed against the vile conspirators who had disappointed them\r\nin their expectations of coining money out of cobwebs.  The Lords and\r\nCommons held inquiries, passed resolutions, demanded impeachments.  It\r\nwas soon made manifest beyond all doubt that members of the Government\r\nhad been scandalously implicated in the worst parts of the fraudulent\r\nspeculations.  Mr. Aislabie, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was only\r\ntoo clearly shown to be one of the leading delinquents.  Mr. Craggs, the\r\nfather, Postmaster-general, and James Craggs, the son, Secretary of\r\nState, were likewise involved.  Both were remarkable men.  The father had\r\nbegun life as a common barber, and partly by capacity and partly by the\r\nthrift that follows fawning, had made his way up in the world until he\r\nreached the height from which he was suddenly and so ignominiously to\r\nfall.  It was hardly worth the trouble thus to toil and push and climb,\r\nonly to tumble down with such shame and ruin.  Craggs the father had had\r\ngreat transfers of South Sea stock made to him for which he never paid.\r\nCraggs the son, the Secretary of State, had acted as the go-between in\r\nthe transactions of the Company with the King's mistresses, whereby the\r\ninfluence of these ladies was purchased for a handsome consideration.\r\nCharles Stanhope, one of the Secretaries to the Treasury and cousin of\r\nthe Minister, was shown to have received large value in the stock of the\r\nCompany for which he never paid.  The most ghastly ruin fell on some of\r\nthese men.  Craggs the younger died suddenly on the very day when the\r\nreport incriminating him was read in the House of Commons.  Craggs the\r\nfather poisoned himself a few {198} days afterwards.  Pope wrote an\r\nepitaph on the son, in which he described him as--\r\n\r\n  \"Statesman, yet friend of truth; of soul sincere,\r\n  In action faithful and in honor clear;\r\n  Who broke no promise, served no private end,\r\n  Who gained no title, and who lost no friend.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEpitaphs seem to have been genuine tributes of personal friendship in\r\nthose days; they had no reference to merit or to truth.  One's friend had\r\nevery virtue because he was one's friend.  Secret committees might\r\ncondemn, Parliament might degrade, juries might convict, impartial\r\nhistory might stigmatize, but one's friend remained one's friend all the\r\nsame; and if one had the gift of verse, was to be held up to the\r\nadmiration of time and eternity in a glorifying epitaph.  We have fallen\r\non more prosaic days now; the living admirer of a modern Craggs would\r\nleave his epitaph unwritten if he could not make facts and feelings fit\r\nbetter in together.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1721--Death of Stanhope]\r\n\r\nA better and more eminent man than Aislabie or either Craggs lost his\r\nlife in consequence of the South Sea calamity.  No one had accused, or\r\neven suspected, Lord Stanhope of any share in the financial swindle.\r\nEven the fact that his cousin was one of those accused of guilty\r\ncomplicity with it did not induce any one to believe that the Minister of\r\nState had any share in the guilt.  Yet Stanhope was one of the first\r\nvictims of the crisis.  The Duke of Wharton, son of the late Minister,\r\nhad just come of age.  He was already renowned as a brilliant, audacious\r\nprofligate.  He was president of the Hell-fire Club; he and some of his\r\ncomrades were the nightly terror of London streets.  Wharton thought fit\r\nto make himself the champion of public purity in the debates on the South\r\nSea Company's ruin.  He attacked the Ministers fiercely; he attacked\r\nStanhope in especial.  Stanhope replied to him with far greater warmth\r\nthan the weight of any attack from Wharton would seem to have called for.\r\nExcited beyond measure, Stanhope burst a blood-vessel in his {199} anger.\r\nHe was carried home, and he died the next day--February 5, 1721.  His\r\nlife had been pure and noble.  He was a sincere lover of his country; a\r\nbrave and often a successful soldier; a statesman of high purpose if not\r\nof the most commanding talents.  His career as a soldier was brought to a\r\nclose when he had to capitulate to that master of war and profligacy, the\r\nDuke de Vendôme; an encounter of a different kind with another brilliant\r\nprofligate robbed him of his life.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons promptly passed a series of resolutions declaring\r\n\"John Aislabie, Esquire, a Member of this House, then Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer and one of the Commissioners of his Majesty's Treasury,\" guilty\r\nof \"most notorious, dangerous, and infamous corruption,\" and ordering his\r\nexpulsion from the House and his committal as a prisoner to the Tower.\r\nThis resolution was carried without a dissentient word.  The House of\r\nCommons went on next to consider that part of the report which applied to\r\nLord Sunderland, and a motion was made declaring that \"after the\r\nproposals of the South Sea Company were accepted by this House, and a\r\nbill ordered to be brought in thereupon, and before such bill passed,\r\n50,000 pounds of the capital stock of the South Sea Company was taken in\r\nby Robert Knight, late cashier of the said Company, for the use and upon\r\nthe account of diaries, Earl of Sunderland, a Lord of Parliament and\r\nFirst Commissioner of the Treasury, without any valuable consideration\r\npaid, or sufficient security given, for payment for or acceptance of the\r\nsame.\"\r\n\r\nSunderland had too many friends, however, and too much influence to be\r\ndealt with as if he were Aislabie.  A fierce debate sprang up.  The\r\nevidence against him was not by any means so clear as in the case of\r\nAislabie.  There was room for a doubt as to Sunderland's personal\r\nknowledge of all that had been done in his name.  His influence and power\r\nsecured him the full benefit of the doubt.  The motion implicating him\r\nwas rejected by a majority of 233 votes against 172, \"which, however,\"\r\n{200} says a contemporary account, \"occasioned various reasonings and\r\nreflections.\"  Charles Stanhope, too, was lucky enough to get off, on a\r\ndivision, by a very narrow majority.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1721--An interview with James Stuart]\r\n\r\nA letter from an English traveller at Rome to his father, bearing date\r\nMay 6, 1721, and privately printed this year (1884) for the first time,\r\nunder the auspices of the Clarendon Society of Edinburgh, gives an\r\ninteresting account of the reception of the writer, an English\r\nProtestant, by James Stuart and his wife.  That part of the letter which\r\nis of present interest to us tells of the remarks made by James on the\r\nsubject of the South Sea catastrophe.  James spoke of the investigations\r\nof the secret committee, from which he had no great hopes; for, he said,\r\nthe authors of the calamity \"would find means to be above the common\r\ncourse of justice.\"  \"Some may imagine,\" continued he, \"that these\r\ncalamities are not displeasing to me, because they may in some measure\r\nturn to my advantage.  I renounce all such unworthy thoughts.  The love\r\nof my country is the first principle of my worldly wishes, and my heart\r\nbleeds to see so brave and honest a people distressed and misled by a few\r\nwicked men, and plunged into miseries almost irretrievable.\"\r\n\"Thereupon,\" says the writer of the letter, \"he rose briskly from his\r\nchair, and expressed his concern with fire in his eyes.\"\r\n\r\nExiled sovereigns are in the habit of expressing concern for their\r\ncountry with fire in their eyes; they are also in the habit of regarding\r\ntheir own return to power as the one sole means of relieving the country\r\nfrom its distress.  The English gentleman who describes this scene\r\nrepresents himself as not to be outdone in patriotism of his own even by\r\nthe exiled Prince.  \"I could not disavow much of what he said; yet I own\r\nI was piqued at it, for very often compassionate terms from the mouth of\r\nan adverse party are grating.  It appeared to me so on this occasion;\r\ntherefore I replied, 'It's true, sir, that our affairs in England lie at\r\npresent under many hardships by the South Sea's mismanagement; but it is\r\na constant {201} maxim with us Protestants to undergo a great deal for\r\nthe security of our religion, which we could not depend upon under a\r\nRomish Government.'\"  This speech, not over-polite, the Prince took in\r\ngood part, and entered upon an argument so skilfully, \"that I am\r\napprehensive I should become half a Jacobite if I should continue\r\nfollowing these discourses any longer.\"  \"Therefore,\" says the writer, \"I\r\nwill give you my word I will enter no more upon arguments of this kind\r\nwith him.\"  The Prince and his visitor were perhaps both playing a part\r\nto some extent, and the whole discourse was probably a good deal less\r\ntheatric in style than the English traveller has reported.  But there can\r\nbe no doubt that the letter fairly illustrates the spirit in which the\r\nleading Jacobites watched over the financial troubles in England, and the\r\nnew hopes with which they were inspired--hopes destined to be translated\r\ninto new action before very long.  Nor can it be denied that the speech\r\nof the English visitor correctly represented the feeling which was\r\ngrowing stronger day after day in the minds of prudent people at home in\r\nEngland.  The time was coming--had almost come--when a political\r\ndisturbance or a financial panic in these kingdoms was to be accounted\r\nsufficient occasion for a change of Ministers, but not for a revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{202}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nAFTER THE STORM.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1721--South Sea victims]\r\n\r\nSwift wrote more than one poem on the South Sea mania.  That which was\r\nwritten in 1721, and is called \"South Sea,\" is a wonder of wit and\r\nwisdom.  It shows the hollowness of the scheme in some new, odd, and\r\nstriking light in every metaphor and every verse.  \"A guinea,\" Swift\r\nreminds his readers, \"will not pass at market for a farthing more,\r\nshown through a multiplying glass, than what it always did before.\"\r\n\r\n  \"So cast it in the Southern Seas,\r\n    And view it through a jobber's bill,\r\n  Put on what spectacles you please,\r\n    Your guinea's but a guinea still.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOther poets had not as much prudence and sound sense as Swift.  Pope\r\nput some of his money, a good deal of it, into South Sea stock,\r\ncontrary to the earnest advice of Atterbury, and lost it.  Swift\r\nreflected faithfully the temper of the time in savage verses, which\r\ncall out for the punishment by death of the fraudulent directors of the\r\nCompany.  Antaeus, Swift tells us, was always restored to fresh\r\nstrength as often as he touched the earth; Hercules subdued him at last\r\nby holding him up in the air and strangling him there.  Suspended a\r\nwhile in the air, according to the same principle, our directors, he\r\nadmonishes the country, will be properly tamed and dealt with.  Many\r\npublic enemies of the directors gave themselves credit for moderation\r\nand humanity on the ground that they would not have the culprits\r\ntortured to death, but merely executed in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\nWalpole set himself first of all to restore public credit.  {203} His\r\nobject was not so much the punishment of fraudulent directors as the\r\ntranquillizing of the public mind and the subsidence of national panic.\r\nHe proposed one measure in the first instance to accomplish this end;\r\nbut that not being sufficiently comprehensive, he introduced another\r\nbill, which was finally adopted by both Houses of Parliament.  Briefly\r\ndescribed, this scheme so adjusted the financial affairs of the South\r\nSea Company that five millions of the seven which the directors had\r\nagreed to pay the public were remitted; the encumbrances to the Company\r\nwere cleared off to a certain extent by the confiscation of the estates\r\nof the fraudulent directors; the credit of the Company's bonds was\r\nmaintained; thirty-three pounds six shillings and eightpence per cent.\r\nwere divided among the proprietors, and two millions were reserved\r\ntowards the liquidation of the national debt.  The Company was\r\ntherefore put into a position to carry out its various public\r\nengagements, and the panic was soon over.  Many of the proprietors of\r\nthe Company complained bitterly of the manner in which they had been\r\ntreated by Walpole.  The lobbies of the House of Commons and all the\r\nadjacent places were crowded by proprietors of the short annuities and\r\nother redeemable popular deeds; men and women who, as the contemporary\r\naccounts tell us, \"in a rude and insolent manner demanded justice of\r\nthe members as they went into the House,\" and put into their hands a\r\npaper with the words written on it, \"Pray do justice to the annuitants\r\nwho lent their money on Parliamentary security.\"  \"The noisy\r\nmultitude,\" we are told, \"were particularly rude to Mr. Comptroller,\r\ntearing part of his coat as he passed by.\"  The Speaker of the House\r\nwas informed that a crowd of people had got together in a riotous and\r\ntumultuous manner in the lobbies and passages, and he ordered \"that the\r\nJustices of the Peace for the City of Westminster do immediately attend\r\nthis House and bring the constables with them.\"  While the justices and\r\nthe constables were being sent for, Sir John Ward was {204} presenting\r\nto the House a petition from the proprietors of the redeemable funds,\r\nsetting forth that they had lent their money to the South Sea Company\r\non Parliamentary security; that they had been unwarily drawn into\r\nsubscribing for the shares in the Company by the artifices of the\r\ndirectors; and they prayed that they might be heard by themselves or\r\ntheir counsel against Walpole's measure--the bill \"for making several\r\nprovisions to restore the public credit, which suffers by the frauds\r\nand mismanagement of the late South Sea directors and others.\"  Walpole\r\nopposed the petition, and said he did not see how the petitioners could\r\nbe relieved, seeing that the resolutions, in pursuance of which his\r\nbill was brought in, had been approved by the King and council, and by\r\na great majority of the House.  Walpole, therefore, moved that the\r\ndebate be adjourned, in order to get rid of the matter.  The motion was\r\ncarried by seventy-eight voices against twenty-nine.  By this time four\r\nJustices for the City of Westminster had arrived, and were brought to\r\nthe bar of the House.  The Speaker informed them that there was a great\r\ncrowd of riotous people in the lobbies and passages, and that he was\r\ncommanded by the House to direct them to go and disperse the crowd, and\r\ntake care to prevent similar riots in the future.  The four justices,\r\nattended by five or six constables, desired the petitioners to clear\r\nthe lobbies, and when they refused to do so, caused a proclamation\r\nagainst rioters to be twice read, warning them at the same time that if\r\nthey remained until the third reading, they would have to incur the\r\npenalties of the Act.  What the penalties of the Act were, and what the\r\nfour justices and five or six constables could have done with the\r\npetitioners if the petitioners had refused to listen to reason, do not\r\nseem very clear.  The petitioners, however, did listen to reason, and\r\ndispersed before the fatal third reading of the proclamation.  But they\r\ndid not disperse without giving the House of Commons and the justices a\r\npiece of their mind.  Many exclaimed that they had come as peaceable\r\ncitizens and {205} subjects to represent their grievances, and had not\r\nexpected to be used like a mob and scoundrels; and others, as they went\r\nout, shouted to the members of Parliament, \"You first pick our pockets,\r\nand then send us to jail for complaining.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1721--Relief measures]\r\n\r\nThe Bill went up to the House of Lords on Monday, August 7th, and the\r\nLords agreed to it without an amendment.  On Thursday, August 10th,\r\nParliament was prorogued.  The Lord Chancellor read the King's speech.\r\n\"The common calamity,\" said his Majesty, \"occasioned by the wicked\r\nexecution of the South Sea scheme, was become so very great before your\r\nmeeting that the providing proper remedies for it was very difficult.\r\nBut it is a great comfort to me to observe that public credit now\r\nbegins to recover, which gives me the greatest hopes that it will be\r\nentirely restored when all the provisions you have made for that end\r\nshall be duly put in execution.\"  The speech went on to tell of his\r\nMajesty's \"great compassion for the sufferings of the innocent, and a\r\njust indignation against the guilty;\" and added that the King had\r\nreadily given his assent \"to such bills as you have presented to me for\r\npunishing the authors of our late misfortunes, and for obtaining the\r\nrestitution and satisfaction due to those who have been injured by them\r\nin such manner as you judged proper.\"  Certainly there was no lack of\r\nseverity in the punishment inflicted on the fraudulent directors.\r\nTheir estates were confiscated with such rigor that some of them were\r\nreduced to miserable poverty.  They were disqualified from ever holding\r\nany public place or office whatever, and from ever having a seat in\r\nParliament.  Yet, severely as they were punished, the outcry of the\r\npublic at the time was that they had been let off far too easily.\r\nWalpole was denounced because he did not carry their punishment much\r\nfarther.  There was even a ridiculous report spread abroad that he had\r\ndefended Sunderland and screened the directors from the most ignoble\r\nand sordid motives, and that he had been handsomely paid for his\r\ncompromise with crime.  {206} Nothing would have satisfied some of the\r\nsufferers by the South Sea scheme short of the execution of its\r\nprincipal directors.  Even the scaffold, however, could hardly have\r\ndealt more stern and summary justice on the criminals--as some of them\r\nundoubtedly were--than did the actual course of events.  When the storm\r\ncleared away, Aislabie was ruined; Craggs, the Postmaster-general, was\r\ndead; Craggs, the Secretary of State, was dead; Lord Stanhope, who was\r\nreally innocent--was really unsuspected of any share in the crimes of\r\nthe fraudulent directors--was dead also; Sunderland was no longer a\r\nMinister of State, and the shadow of death was already on him.  It was\r\nnot merely the bursting of a bubble, it was the bursting of a shell--it\r\nmutilated or killed those who stood around and near.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1722--Sunderland's antipathy to Walpole]\r\n\r\nBy the time of the new elections--for Parliament had now nearly run its\r\ncourse--public tranquillity was entirely restored.  Parliament was\r\ndissolved in March, 1722, and the new elections left Walpole and his\r\nfriends in power, with an immense majority at their back.  Long before\r\nthe new Parliament had time to assemble, Lord Sunderland suddenly died\r\nof heart disease.  On April 19, 1722, his death took place, and it was\r\nso unexpected that a wild outcry was raised by some of his friends, who\r\ninsisted that his enemies had poisoned him.  The medical examination\r\nproved, however, that Sunderland's disease was one which might at any\r\nmoment of excitement have brought on his death.  Nearly all the leading\r\npublic men who, innocent or guilty, had been mixed up with the evil\r\nschemes of the South Sea Company were now in the grave.\r\n\r\nThe field seemed now clear and open to Walpole.  The death of\r\nSunderland, following so soon on that of Stanhope, had left him\r\napparently without a rival.  Sunderland had been to the last a\r\npolitical, and even a personal, enemy of Walpole.  Although Walpole had\r\ngone so far to protect Sunderland against the House of Commons and\r\nagainst public opinion, with regard to his share in {207} the South Sea\r\nCompany's transactions, Sunderland could not forgive Walpole because\r\nWalpole was rising higher in the State--because he was, in fact, the\r\ngreater man.  Though Sunderland was compelled by public opinion to\r\nresign office, he had contrived, up to the hour of his death, to\r\nmaintain his influence over the mind of King George.  Fortunately for\r\nGeorge, the King had too much clear, robust good-sense not to recognize\r\nthe priceless worth of Walpole's advice and Walpole's services.\r\nSunderland tried one ingenious artifice to get rid of Walpole.  He\r\nsuggested to George that Walpole's merits required some special and\r\npermanent recognition, and he recommended that the King should create\r\nWalpole Postmaster-general for life.  Such an office, indeed, would\r\nhave brought Walpole an ample revenue, supposing he stood in need of\r\nmoney, which he did not, but it would have disqualified him forever for\r\na seat in Parliament.  Perhaps no better illustration of Sunderland's\r\nnarrow intellect and utter lack of judgment could be found than the\r\nsupposition that this shallow trick could succeed, and that the\r\ngreatest administrator of his time could be thus quietly withdrawn from\r\nParliamentary life and from the higher work of the State, and shelved\r\nin perpetuity as a Postmaster-general.  King George was not to be taken\r\nin after this fashion.  He asked Sunderland whether Walpole wished for\r\nsuch an office, or was acquainted with Sunderland's intention to make\r\nthe suggestion.  Sunderland had to answer both questions in the\r\nnegative.  \"Then,\" said the King, \"pray do not make him any such offer,\r\nor say anything about it to him.  I had to part with him once, much\r\nagainst my will, and so long as he is willing to serve me I will never\r\npart with him again.\"  This incident shows that, if Sunderland had\r\nlived, he would have plotted against Walpole to the end, and would have\r\nstood in Walpole's way to the best of his power, and with all the\r\nunforgiving hostility of the narrow-minded and selfish man who has had\r\nservices rendered him for which he ought to feel grateful but cannot.\r\n\r\n{208}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1721-1722--Marlborough's closing days]\r\n\r\nA far greater man than Sunderland was soon to pass away.\r\n\r\n  \"From Marlborough's eyes the streams of dotage flow.\"\r\n\r\nThese are the famous words in which Johnson depicts the miserable decay\r\nof a great spirit, and points anew the melancholy moral of the vanity\r\nof human wishes.  Hardly a line in the poetry of our language is better\r\nknown or more often quoted.  Where did Johnson get the idea that\r\nMarlborough had sunk into dotage before his death?  There is not the\r\nslightest foundation for such a belief.  All that we know of\r\nMarlborough's closing days tells us the contrary.  Nothing in\r\nMarlborough's life, not even his serene disregard of dangers and\r\ndifficulties, not even his victories, became him like to the leaving of\r\nit.  No great man ever sank more gracefully, more gently, with a calmer\r\nspirit, down to his rest.  We get some charming pictures of\r\nMarlborough's closing days.  Death had given him warning by repeated\r\nparalytic strokes.  On November 27, 1721, he was seen for the last time\r\nin the House of Lords.  He was not, however, quite near his death even\r\nthen.  He used to spend his time at Blenheim, or at his lodge in\r\nWindsor.  To the last he was fond of riding and driving and the fresh\r\ncountry air.  In-doors he loved to be surrounded by his granddaughters\r\nand their young friends, and to join in games of cards and other\r\namusements with them.  They used to get up private theatricals to\r\ngratify the gentle old warrior.  We hear of a version of Dryden's \"All\r\nfor Love\" being thus performed.  The Duchess of Marlborough had cut out\r\nof the play its unseemly passages, and even its too amorous\r\nexpressions--the reader will probably think there was not much left of\r\nthe piece when this work of purification had been accomplished--and she\r\nwould not allow any embracing to be performed.  The gentleman who\r\nplayed Mark Antony wore a sword which had been presented to Marlborough\r\nby the Emperor.  The part of the high-priest was played by a pretty\r\ngirl, a friend of Marlborough's granddaughters, and she wore as {209}\r\nhigh-priest's robe what seems to have been a lady's night-dress,\r\ngorgeously embroidered with special devices for the occasion.  A\r\nprologue, written by Dr. Hoadly, was read, in which the glories of the\r\ngreat Duke's career were glowingly recounted.  Some painter, it seems\r\nto us, might make a pretty picture of this: the great hall in Blenheim\r\nturned into a theatre, the handsome young men and pretty girls enacting\r\ntheir chastened parts, the fading old hero looking at the scene with\r\npleased and kindly eyes, and the imperious, loving old Duchess turning\r\nher devoted gaze on him.\r\n\r\nSo fades, so languishes, grows dim, and dies the conqueror of Blenheim,\r\nthe greatest soldier England ever had since the days when kings ceased\r\nto be as a matter of right her chiefs in command.  In the early days of\r\nJune, 1722, Marlborough was stricken by another paralytic seizure, and\r\nthis was his last.  He was in full possession of his senses to the end,\r\nperfectly conscious and calm.  He knew that he was dying; he had\r\nprayers read to him; he conveyed in many tender ways his feelings of\r\naffection for his wife, and of hope for his own future.  At four in the\r\nmorning of June 16th his life ebbed quietly away.  He was in his\r\nseventy-second year when he died.  None of the great deeds of his life\r\nbelong to this history; none of that life's worst offences have much to\r\ndo with it.  Marlborough's career seems to us absolutely faultless in\r\ntwo of its aspects; as a commander and as a husband we can only give\r\nhim praise.  He was probably a greater commander than even the Duke of\r\nWellington.  If he never had to encounter a Napoleon, he had to meet\r\nand triumph over difficulties which never came in Wellington's way.  It\r\nwas not Wellington's fate to have to strive against political treachery\r\nof the basest kind on the part of English Ministers of State.\r\nWellington's enemies were all in the field arrayed against him;\r\nMarlborough had to fight the foreign enemy on the battle-field, and to\r\nstruggle meanwhile against the persistent treachery of the still more\r\nformidable enemy {210} at home in the council-chamber of his own\r\nsovereign.  Perhaps, indeed, Wellington's nature would not have\r\npermitted him to succeed under such difficulties.  Wellington could\r\nhardly have met craft with craft, and, it must be added, falsehood with\r\nfalsehood, as Marlborough did.  We have said in this book already that\r\neven for that age of double-dealing Marlborough was a surprising\r\ndouble-dealer, and there were many passages in his career which are\r\nevidences of an astounding capacity for deceit.  \"He was a great man,\"\r\nsaid his enemy, Lord Peterborough, \"and I have forgotten his faults.\"\r\nHistorians would gladly do the same if they could; would surely dwell\r\nwith much more delight on the virtues and the greatness than on the\r\ndefects.  The English people were generous to Marlborough, and in the\r\nway which, it has to be confessed, was most welcome to him.  But if a\r\nvery treasure-house of gold could not have satisfied his love of money,\r\nlet it be added that the national treasure-house itself, were it poured\r\nout at his feet, could not have overpaid the services which he had\r\nrendered to his country.\r\n\r\nMarlborough left no son to inherit his honors and his fortune.  His\r\ntitles and estates descended to his eldest daughter, the Countess of\r\nGodolphin.  She died without leaving a son, and the titles and estates\r\npassed over to the Earl of Sunderland, the son and heir of\r\nMarlborough's second daughter, at that time long dead.  From the day\r\nwhen the victor of Blenheim died, there has been no Duke of Marlborough\r\ndistinguished in anything but the name.  Not one of the world's great\r\nsoldiers, it would seem, was destined to have a great soldier for a\r\nson.  From great statesman fathers sometimes spring great statesman\r\nsons; but Alexander, Hannibal, Julius Caesar, Charles the Twelfth,\r\nAlexander Farnese, Clive, Marlborough, Frederick, Napoleon, Wellington,\r\nWashington, left to the world no heir of their greatness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{211}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE BANISHMENT OF ATTERBURY.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1722--Funeral of Marlborough]\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, August 9, 1722, the \"pompous solemnity\" of Marlborough's\r\nfuneral took place.  The great procession went from the Duke's house in\r\nSt. James's Park, through St. James's and the Upper Park to Hyde Park\r\nCorner, and thence through Piccadilly, St. James's Street, Pall Mall,\r\nCharing Cross, and King Street to Westminster Abbey.  A small army of\r\nsoldiers guarded the remains of the greatest warrior of his age; a whole\r\nheralds' college clustered about the lofty funeral banner on which all\r\nthe arms of the Churchills were quartered.  Marlborough's friends and\r\nadmirers, his old brothers-in-arms, the companions of his victories,\r\nfollowed his coffin, and listened while Garter King-at-Arms, bending over\r\nthe open grave, said: \"Thus it hath pleased Almighty God to take out of\r\nthis transitory life unto His mercy the most high, most mighty, and most\r\nnoble prince, John Churchill, Duke and Earl of Marlborough.\"\r\n\r\nIn Applebee's _Weekly Journal_ for Saturday, August 11th, two days after\r\nthe funeral, we are told that the Duchess of Marlborough, in honor of the\r\nmemory of her life-long lover, had offered a prize of five hundred pounds\r\nfor a Latin epitaph to be inscribed upon his tomb, and that \"several\r\npoets have already taken to their lofty studies to contend for the prize.\"\r\n\r\nAt Marlborough's funeral we see for the last time in high public estate\r\none of the few Englishmen of the day who could properly be named in the\r\nsame breath with Marlborough.  This was Francis Atterbury, the eloquent\r\nand daring Bishop of Rochester.  Atterbury came up to {212} town for the\r\npurpose of officiating at the funeral of the great Duke.  On July 30,\r\n1722, he wrote from the country to his friend Pope, announcing his visit\r\nto London.  \"I go to-morrow,\" Atterbury writes, \"to the Deanery, and I\r\nbelieve I shall stay there till I have said dust to dust, and shut up\r\nthis last scene of pompous vanity.\"  Atterbury does not seem to have been\r\nprofoundly impressed with the religious solemnity of the occasion.  His\r\nwas not a very reverential spirit.  There was as little of the temper of\r\npious sanctity in Atterbury as in Swift himself.  The allusion to the\r\nlast scene of pompous vanity might have had another significance, as well\r\nas that which Atterbury meant to give to it.  Amid the pomp in which\r\nMarlborough's career went out, the career of Atterbury went out as well,\r\nalthough in a different way, and not closed sublimely by death.  After\r\nthe funeral, Atterbury went to the Deanery at Westminster--he was Dean of\r\nWestminster as well as Bishop of Rochester--and there, on August 24th,\r\nthe day but one after the scene of pompous vanity, he was arrested by the\r\nUnder-Secretary of State, accompanied by two officers of justice, and was\r\nbrought, along with all papers of his which the officers could seize,\r\nbefore the Privy Council.  He underwent an examination, as the result of\r\nwhich he was committed to the Tower, on a charge of having been concerned\r\nin a treasonable conspiracy to dethrone the King, and to bring back the\r\nHouse of Stuart.  In the Tower he was left to languish for many a long\r\nday before it was found convenient to bring him to trial.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1722--The King's speech]\r\n\r\nEngland was startled by the disclosures which followed Atterbury's\r\narrest.  On Tuesday, October 9, 1722, the sixth Parliament of Great\r\nBritain--the sixth, that is to say, since the union with Scotland--met at\r\nWestminster.  The House of Commons, on the motion of Mr. Pulteney,\r\nelected Mr. Spencer Compton their Speaker, and on the next day but one,\r\nOctober 11th, the Royal speech was read.  The King was present in person,\r\nbut the speech was read by the Lord Chancellor, for the good reason which\r\nwe {213} have already mentioned that his Majesty the King of England\r\ncould not speak the English language.  The speech opened with a startling\r\nannouncement.  \"My Lords and Gentlemen\"--so ran the words of the\r\nSovereign--\"I am concerned to find myself obliged, at the opening of this\r\nParliament, to acquaint you that a dangerous conspiracy has been for some\r\ntime formed, and is still carrying on, against my person and government,\r\nin favor of a Popish pretender.\"  \"Some of the conspirators,\" the speech\r\nwent on to say, \"have been taken up and secured, and endeavors are used\r\nfor the apprehending others.\"  When the speech was read, and the King had\r\nleft the House, the Duke of Grafton, then Lord-lieutenant of Ireland,\r\nbrought in a bill for suspending the Habeas Corpus Act, and empowering\r\nthe Government to secure and detain \"such persons as his Majesty shall\r\nsuspect are conspiring against his person and government, for the space\r\nof one year.\"  The motion to read the Bill a second time in the same\r\nsitting was strenuously resisted by a considerable minority of the Peers.\r\nA warm debate took place, and in the end the second reading was carried\r\nby a majority of sixty-seven against twenty-four.  The debate was renewed\r\nupon the other stages of the Bill, which were taken in rapid succession.\r\nThe proposal of the Government was, of course, carried in the end, but it\r\nmet with a resistance in the House of Lords which certainly would not\r\nhave been offered to such a proposal by any member of the hereditary\r\nchamber in our day.  Some of the recorded protests of dissentient peers\r\nread more like the utterances of modern Radicals than those of\r\ninfluential members of the House of Lords.  The strongest objection made\r\nto the proposal was that the utmost term for which the Constitution had\r\npreviously been suspended was six months, and that the measure to suspend\r\nit for a year would become an authority for suspending it at some future\r\ntime for two years, or three years, or any term which might please the\r\nministers in power.  On Monday, October 15th, the Bill was brought down\r\nto the Commons, and was read {214} a first time on the motion of Walpole.\r\nThe Bill was passed in the Commons, not, indeed, without opposition, but\r\nwith an opposition much less strenuous and influential than that which\r\nhad been offered to it in the House of Lords.  On October 17th it was\r\nannounced to Parliament that Dr. Atterbury, the Bishop of Rochester, the\r\nLord North and Grey, and the Earl of Orrery, had been committed to the\r\nTower on a charge of high-treason.  A few days after, a similar\r\nannouncement was made about the arrest and committal of the Duke of\r\nNorfolk.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1722--Proclamation of James]\r\n\r\nBy far the most important of the persons committed for trial was the\r\nBishop of Rochester.  Francis Atterbury may rank among the most\r\nconspicuous public men of his time.  He stands only just beneath\r\nMarlborough and Bolingbroke and Walpole.  Steele, in his sixty-sixth\r\n_Tatler_, pays a high tribute to Atterbury: \"He has so much regard to his\r\ncongregation that he commits to memory what he has to say to them, and\r\nhas so soft and graceful a behavior that it must attract your attention.\r\nHis person, it is to be confessed, is no slight recommendation; but he is\r\nto be highly commended for not losing that advantage, and adding to a\r\npropriety of speech which might pass the criticism of Longinus, an action\r\nwhich would have been approved by Demosthenes.  He has a peculiar force\r\nin his way, and has many of his audience who could not be intelligent\r\nhearers of his discourse were there not explanation as well as grace in\r\nhis action.  This art of his is used with the most exact and honest\r\nskill; he never attempts your passions until he has convinced your\r\nreason; all the objections which he can form are laid open and dispersed\r\nbefore he uses the least vehemence in his sermon; but when he thinks he\r\nhas your head he very soon wins your heart, and never pretends to show\r\nthe beauty of holiness until he hath convinced you of the truth of it.\"\r\n\r\nAtterbury had, however, among his many gifts a dangerous gift of\r\npolitical intrigue.  Like Swift and Dubois and Alberoni, he was at least\r\nas much statesman as churchman.  {215} He had mixed himself up in various\r\nintrigues--some of them could hardly be called conspiracies--for the\r\nrestoration of the Stuarts, and when at last something like a new\r\nconspiracy was planned, it was not likely that he would be left out of\r\nit.  He had courage enough for any such scheme.  There was no great\r\ndifficulty in finding out the new plot which King George mentioned in his\r\nspeech to Parliament; for James Stuart had revealed it himself by a\r\nproclamation which he caused to be circulated among his supposed\r\nadherents in England, renewing in the boldest terms his claim to the\r\ncrown of England.  A sort of junto of Jacobites appears to have been\r\nestablished in England to make arrangements for a new attempt on the part\r\nof James; the noblemen whom King George had arrested were understood to\r\nbe among its leading members.  Atterbury was charged with having taken a\r\nprominent if not, indeed, a foremost part in the conspiracy.  The Duke of\r\nNorfolk, Lord North and Grey, and Lord Orrery were afterwards discharged\r\nfor want of evidence to convict them.  The arrest of a number of humbler\r\nconspirators led to the discovery of a correspondence asserted to have\r\nbeen carried on between Atterbury and the adherents of James Stuart in\r\nFrance and Italy.\r\n\r\nBoth Houses of Parliament began by voting addresses of loyalty and\r\ngratitude to the King, and by resolving that the proclamation entitled\r\n\"Declaration of James the Third, King of England, Scotland, and Ireland,\r\nto all his loving subjects of the three nations,\" and signed \"James Rex,\"\r\nwas \"a false, insolent, and traitorous libel,\" and should be burned by\r\nthe hands of the common hangman, under the direction of the sheriffs of\r\nLondon.  This important ceremonial was duly carried out at the Royal\r\nExchange.  Then the House of Commons voted, \"that towards raising the\r\nsupply, and reimbursing to the public the great expenses occasioned by\r\nthe late rebellions and disorders, the sum of one hundred thousand pounds\r\nbe raised and levied upon the real and personal estates of {216} all\r\nPapists, Popish recusants, or persons educated in the Popish religion, or\r\nwhose parents are Papists, or who shall profess the Popish religion, in\r\nlieu of all forfeitures already incurred for or upon account of their\r\nrecusancy.\"  This singular method of infusing loyalty into the Roman\r\nCatholics of England was not allowed to be adopted without serious and\r\npowerful resistance in the House of Commons.  The idea was not to devise\r\na new penalty for the Catholics, but to put in actual operation the terms\r\nof a former penalty pronounced against them in Elizabeth's time, and not\r\nthen pressed into execution.  This fact was dwelt upon with much emphasis\r\nby the advocates of the penal motion.  Why talk of religious persecution?\r\nthey asked.  This is not religious persecution; it is only putting in\r\nforce an edict passed in a former reign to punish Roman Catholics for\r\npolitical rebellion.  This way of putting the case seems only to make the\r\ncharacter of the policy more clear and less justifiable.  The Catholics\r\nof King George's time were to be mulcted indiscriminately because the\r\nCatholics of Queen Elizabeth's time had been declared liable to such a\r\npenalty.  The Master of the Rolls, to his great credit, strongly opposed\r\nthe resolution.  Walpole supported it with all the weight of his argument\r\nand his influence.  The plot was evidently a Popish plot, he contended,\r\nand although he was not prepared to accuse any English Catholic in\r\nparticular of taking part in it, yet there could be no doubt that Papists\r\nin general were well-wishers to it, and that some of them had contributed\r\nlarge sums towards it.  Why, then, should they not be made to reimburse\r\nsome part of the expense to which they and the friends of the Pretender\r\nhad put the nation?  The resolution, after it had been reported from\r\ncommittee, was only carried in the whole House by 188 votes against 172.\r\n[Sidenote: 1723--Lord Cowper's opposition] The resolution was embodied in\r\na bill, and the Bill, when it went up to the House of Lords, was opposed\r\nthere by several of the Peers, and especially by Lord Cowper, the\r\n\"silver-tongued Cowper,\" who had {217} been so distinguished a Lord\r\nChancellor under Anne, and under George himself.  Lord Cowper's was an\r\neloquent and a powerful speech.  It tore to pieces the wretched web of\r\nflimsy sophistry by which the supporters of the Bill endeavored to make\r\nout that it was not a measure of religious persecution.  Indeed, there\r\nwere some of these who insisted that, so far from being a measure of\r\npersecution, it was a measure of relief.  Our readers will, no doubt, be\r\ncurious to know how this bold position was sustained.  In this wise: the\r\npenalties prescribed for the Catholics in Elizabeth's reign were much\r\ngreater in amount than those which the Bill proposed to inflict on the\r\nCatholics of King George's time; therefore the Bill was an indulgence and\r\nnot a persecution--a mitigation of penalty, not a punishment.  Let us\r\nreduce the argument to plain figures.  A Catholic in the reign of\r\nElizabeth is declared liable to a penalty of twenty pounds, but out of\r\nconsiderations of humanity or justice the penalty is not enforced.  The\r\ndescendant and heir of that same Catholic in the reign of George the\r\nFirst is fined fifteen pounds, and the fine is exacted.  He complains,\r\nand he is told, \"You have no right to complain; you ought to be grateful;\r\nthe original fine ordained was twenty pounds; you have been let off five\r\npounds--you have been favored by an act of indulgence, not victimized by\r\nan act of persecution.\"  Lord Cowper had not much trouble in disposing of\r\narguments of this kind, but his speech took a wider range, and is indeed\r\na masterly exposure of the whole principle on which the measure was\r\nfounded.  On May 22, 1723, sixty-nine peers voted for the third reading\r\nof the Bill, and fifty-five opposed it.  Lord Cowper, with twenty other\r\npeers, entered a protest against the decision of the House, according to\r\na practice then common in the House of Lords, and which has lately fallen\r\ninto complete disuse.  The recorded protests of dissentient peers form,\r\nwe may observe, very important historical documents, and deserve, some of\r\nthem, {218} a careful study.  Lord Cowper's protest was the last public\r\nact of his useful and honorable career.  He died on the 10th of October\r\nin the same year, 1723.  Some of his enemies explained his action on the\r\nanti-Papist Bill by the assertion that he was a Jacobite at heart.  Even\r\nif he had been, the fact would hardly have made his conduct less\r\ncreditable and spirited.  Many a man who was a Jacobite at heart would\r\nhave supported a measure for the punishment of Roman Catholics if only to\r\nsave himself from the suspicion of sympathy with the lost cause.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1723--Charges against Atterbury]\r\n\r\nThis, however, was but an episode in the story of the Jacobite plot and\r\nthe measures taken to punish those who were engaged in it.  Committees of\r\nsecrecy were appointed by Parliament to inquire into the evidence and\r\nexamine witnesses.\r\n\r\nMeantime both Houses of Parliament kept voting address after address to\r\nthe Crown at each new stage of the proceedings, and as each fresh\r\nevidence of the conspiracy was laid before them.  The King must have\r\ngrown rather weary of finding new words of gratitude, and the Houses of\r\nParliament, one would think, must have grown tired of inventing new\r\nphrases of loyalty and fresh expressions of horror at the wickedness of\r\nthe Jacobites.  The horror was not quite genuine on the part of some who\r\nthus proclaimed it.  Many of those who voted the addresses would gladly\r\nhave welcomed a restoration of the Stuarts.  Not the most devoted\r\nadherent of King George could really have felt any surprise at the\r\npersistent efforts of the Jacobite partisans.  Eight years before this it\r\nwas a mere toss-up whether Stuart or Hanover should succeed, and even\r\nstill it was not quite certain whether, if the machinery of the modern\r\n_plebiscite_ could have been put into operation in England, the majority\r\nwould not have been found in sympathy with Atterbury.  It is almost\r\ncertain that if the _plebiscite_ could have been taken in Ireland and\r\nScotland also, a majority of voices would have voted James Stuart to the\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\n{219}\r\n\r\nIt was resolved to proceed against Atterbury by a Bill of Pains and\r\nPenalties to be brought into Parliament.  The evidence against him was\r\ncertainly not such as any criminal court would have held to justify a\r\nconviction.  A young barrister named Christopher Layer was arrested and\r\nexamined, so were a nonjuring minister named Kelly, an Irish Catholic\r\npriest called Neynoe, and a man named Plunkett, also from Ireland.  The\r\ncharge against Atterbury was founded on the statements obtained or\r\nextorted from these men.  It should be said that Layer gave evidence\r\nwhich actually seemed to impugn Lord Cowper himself as a member of a club\r\nof disaffected persons; and when Lord Cowper indignantly repudiated the\r\ncharge and demanded an inquiry, the Government declared inquiry\r\nabsolutely unnecessary, as everybody was well assured of his innocence.\r\nThe Government, however, declined to follow Lord Cowper in his not\r\nunreasonable assumption that the whole story was unworthy of explicit\r\ncredence when it included such a false statement.  The case against\r\nAtterbury rested on the declaration of some of the arrested men that the\r\nbishop had carried on a correspondence with James Stuart, Lord Mar, and\r\nGeneral Dillon (an Irish Catholic soldier, who after the capitulation of\r\nLimerick, had entered the French service), through the instrumentality of\r\nKelly, who acted as his secretary and amanuensis for that purpose.  It\r\nwas a case of circumstantial evidence altogether.  The impartial reader\r\nof history now will feel well satisfied on two points: first, that\r\nAtterbury was engaged in the plot; and second, that the evidence brought\r\nagainst him was not nearly strong enough to sustain a conviction.  It was\r\nthe case of Bolingbroke and Harley over again.  We know now that the men\r\nhad done the things charged against them, but the evidence then relied\r\nupon was utterly inadequate to sustain the charge.\r\n\r\nA \"Dialogue in Verse between a Whig and a Tory\" was written by Swift in\r\nthe year 1723, \"concerning the horrid plot discovered by Harlequin, the\r\nBishop of {220} Rochester's French Dog.\"  The Whig tells the Tory that\r\nthe dog--\r\n\r\n  \"His name is Harlequin, I wot,\r\n  And that's a name in every plot\"--\r\n\r\nwas generously\r\n\r\n  \"Resolved to save the British nation,\r\n  Though French by birth and education;\r\n  His correspondence plainly dated\r\n  Was all deciphered and translated;\r\n  His answers were exceeding pretty,\r\n  Before the secret wise committee;\r\n  Confessed as plain as he could bark,\r\n  Then with his fore-foot set his mark.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1723-1731--Atterbury's sentence]\r\n\r\nThere was more than mere fooling in the lines.  The dog Harlequin was\r\nmade to bear important evidence against the Bishop of Rochester.\r\nAtterbury had never resigned himself to the Hanoverian dynasty.  He did\r\nnot believe it would last, and he openly declaimed against it.  He did\r\nmore than this, however: he engaged in conspiracies for the restoration\r\nof James Stuart.  Horace Walpole says of him that he was simply a\r\nJacobite priest.  He was a Jacobite priest who would gladly, if he could,\r\nhave been a Jacobite soldier, and had given ample evidence of courage\r\nequal to such a part.  He had been engaged in a long correspondence with\r\nJacobite conspirators at home and abroad.  The correspondence was carried\r\non in cipher, and of course under feigned names.  Atterbury appears to\r\nhave been described now as Mr. Illington, and now as Mr. Jones.\r\nAtterbury refused to make any defence before the House of Commons, but he\r\nappeared before the House of Lords on May 6, 1723, and defended himself,\r\nand made strong and eloquent protestation of his innocence.  One of the\r\nwitnesses whom he called in his defence was his friend Pope, who could\r\nonly give evidence as to the manner in which the bishop had passed his\r\ntime when staying in the poet's house.  Christopher Layer, Atterbury's\r\nassociate in the general charge of conspiracy, was a young barrister of\r\ngood family, a remarkably handsome, {221} graceful, and accomplished man.\r\nOne charge against him was that he had formed a plan to murder the King\r\nand carry off the Prince of Wales; but the statements made against Layer\r\nmust be taken with liberal allowance for the extravagance of loyal\r\npassion, panic, and exaggeration.  Layer had escaped and was recaptured,\r\nwas tried, found guilty, and sentenced to death.  He was hanged at Tyburn\r\non March 15, 1723; he met his death with calm courage.  His body was\r\nquartered and his head was set on Temple Bar, from which it was presently\r\nblown down by the wind.  Some one picked up the head and sold it to a\r\nsurgeon.  Neynoe, another of the accused men, contrived to escape from\r\ncustody, got to the river, endeavored to swim across it, and was drowned\r\nin the attempt.\r\n\r\nThe charges made against Atterbury had therefore sometimes to rest upon\r\ninferences drawn from confessions, or portions of confessions, averred to\r\nhave dropped or been drawn from men whose lips were now closed by death.\r\nThose who defended Atterbury dwelt strongly on this fact, as was but\r\nnatural.  It is curious to notice how often in the debates of the Lords\r\non the Bill of Pains and Penalties one noble peer accuses another of\r\nsecret sympathy with Jacobite schemes.  As regards Atterbury, the whole\r\nquestion was whether he was really the person described in the\r\ncorrespondence now as Jones and now as Illington.  There might have been\r\nno evidence which even a \"secret, wise\" committee of that day would have\r\ncared to accept but for the fact that the bishop's wife had received, or\r\nwas to have received, from France a present of a dog called Harlequin,\r\nand that there was mention in the correspondence about poor Mr. Illington\r\nbeing in grief for the loss of his dog Harlequin.  This allusion put the\r\ncommittee of secrecy on the track.  The bishop's wife had lately died,\r\nand it would seem from the correspondence that Illington's wife had died\r\nabout the same time.  Clearly, if it were once assumed that Illington and\r\nAtterbury were one and the same person, there was ample ground for\r\nsuspicion, and even for a general belief that the story told {222} was\r\ntrue in the main.  The evidence was enough for Parliament at that time,\r\nand the Bill passed the House of Lords on May 16th by a majority of\r\neighty-three votes to forty-three.  Atterbury was deprived of all his\r\noffices and dignities, declared to be forever incapable of holding any\r\nplace or exercising any authority within the King's dominions, and\r\ncondemned to perpetual banishment.  He went to France in the first\r\ninstance with his daughter and her husband.  It so happened that\r\nBolingbroke had just at that time obtained a sort of conditional pardon\r\nfrom the King; obtained it mainly by bribing the Duchess of Kendal.  The\r\ntwo Jacobites crossed each other on the way, one going into exile, the\r\nother returning from it.  \"I am exchanged,\" was Atterbury's remark.  \"The\r\nnation,\" said Pope afterwards, \"is afraid of being overrun with genius,\r\nand cannot regain one great man but at the expense of another.\"  So far\r\nas this history is concerned we part with Atterbury here.  He lived\r\nabroad until 1731, and after his death his remains were brought back and\r\nprivately laid in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1723--Tom Tempest and Jack Sneaker]\r\n\r\nWe have directed attention to the freedom and frequency of the\r\naccusations of Jacobitism made by one peer against another during the\r\ndebates on Atterbury's case.  The fact is worthy of note, if only to show\r\nhow uncertain, even still, was the foundation of the throne of Brunswick,\r\nand how wide-spread the sympathy with the lost cause was supposed to be.\r\nWhen Bolingbroke was allowed to return to England, some of Swift's\r\nfriends instantly fancied that he must have purchased his permission by\r\ntelling some tale against the dean himself, among others, and long after\r\nthis time we find Swift defending himself against the rumored accusation\r\nof a share in Jacobite conspiracy.  The condition of the public mind is\r\nwell pictured in a description of two imaginary politicians in one of the\r\nsuccessors to the _Tatler_.  \"Tom Tempest\" is described as a steady\r\nfriend to the House of Stuart.  He can recount the prodigies that have\r\nappeared in the sky, and the calamities that have afflicted the {223}\r\nnation every year from the Revolution, and is of opinion that if the\r\nexiled family had continued to reign, there would neither have been worms\r\nin our ships nor caterpillars in our trees.  He firmly believes that King\r\nWilliam burned Whitehall that he might steal the furniture, and that\r\nTillotson died an atheist.  Of Queen Anne he speaks with more tenderness;\r\nowns that she meant well, and can tell by whom she was poisoned.  Tom has\r\nalways some new promise that we shall see in another month the rightful\r\nmonarch on the throne.  \"Jack Sneaker,\" on the other hand, is a devoted\r\nadherent to the present establishment.  He has known those who saw the\r\nbed in which the Pretender was conveyed in a warming-pan.  He often\r\nrejoices that this nation was not enslaved by the Irish.  He believes\r\nthat King William never lost a battle, and that if he had lived one year\r\nlonger he would have conquered France.  Yet amid all this satisfaction he\r\nis hourly disturbed by dread of Popery; wonders that stricter laws are\r\nnot made against the Papists, and is sometimes afraid that they are busy\r\nwith French gold among our bishops and judges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{224}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nWALPOLE IN POWER AS WELL AS OFFICE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1723--Walpole's Administration]\r\n\r\nWalpole was now Prime-minister.  The King wished to reward him for his\r\nservices by conferring a peerage on him, but this honor Walpole\r\nsteadily declined.  One of his biographers says that his refusal \"at\r\nfirst appears extraordinary.\"  It ought not to appear extraordinary at\r\nfirst or at last.  Walpole knew that the sceptre of government in\r\nEngland had passed to the House of Commons.  He would have been unwise\r\nand inconsistent indeed if at his time of life he had consented to\r\nrenounce the influence and the power which a seat in that House gave\r\nhim for the comparative insignificance and obscurity of a seat in the\r\nHouse of Lords.  He accepted a title for his eldest son, who was made\r\nBaron Walpole, but for himself he preferred to keep to the field in\r\nwhich he had won his name, and where he could make his influence and\r\npower felt all over the land.\r\n\r\nWe may anticipate the course of events, and say at once that hardly\r\never before in the history of English political life, and hardly ever\r\nsince Walpole's time, has a minister had so long a run of power.  His\r\nlong administration, as Mr. Green well says, is almost without a\r\nhistory.  It is almost without a history, that is to say, in the\r\nordinary sense of the word.  For the most part, the steady movement of\r\nEngland's progress remains, during long years and years, undisturbed by\r\nany event of great dramatic interest at home or abroad.  But the period\r\nof Walpole's long and successful administration was none the less a\r\nperiod of the highest importance in English {225} history.  It was a\r\ntime of almost uninterrupted national development in the right\r\ndirection, and almost unbroken national prosperity.  The foreign policy\r\nof Walpole was, on the whole, no less sound and just than his policy at\r\nhome.  His first ambition was to keep England out of wars with foreign\r\nPowers.  Yet his was not the ambition which some later statesmen,\r\nespecially, for example, Mr. Bright, have owned--the ambition to keep\r\nEngland free of any foreign policy whatever.  Such an ambition was not\r\nWalpole's, and such an ambition at Walpole's time it would have been\r\nall but impossible to realize.  Walpole knew well that there was no way\r\nof keeping England out of foreign wars at that season of political\r\ngrowth but by securing for her a commanding influence in Continental\r\naffairs.  Such influence he set himself to establish, and he succeeded\r\nin establishing it by friendly and satisfactory alliances with France\r\nand other Powers.  Turning back for a moment into the political affairs\r\nof a year or two previous, we may remark that one of the consequences\r\nof the Mississippi scheme, and the reign of Mr. Law in France, had been\r\nthe recall of Lord Stair from the French Court, to which he was\r\naccredited as English ambassador.  Lord Stair quarrelled with Law when\r\nLaw was all-powerful; and in order to propitiate the financial\r\ndictator, it was found convenient to recall Stair from Paris.  England\r\nhad been well served by him as her ambassador at the French Court.  We\r\nhave already said something of Lord Stair--his ability, courage, and\r\ndexterity, his winning ways, and his fearless spirit.  John Dalrymple,\r\nsecond Earl of Stair, was one of the remarkable men of his time.  He\r\nwas a scholar and an orator, a soldier and a diplomatist.  He had\r\nfought with conspicuous bravery and skill under William the Third and\r\nunder Marlborough.  He appears to have combined a daring that looked\r\nlike recklessness with a cool calculation which made it prudence.  On\r\nMarlborough's fall, Lord Stair fell with him.  He was deprived of all\r\nhis public offices, and was plunged into a condition of {226} something\r\nlike poverty.  When George the First came to the throne, Stair was\r\ntaken into favor again, and as a special tribute to his diplomatic\r\ncapacity was sent to represent England at the Court of France.  There\r\nhe displayed consummate sagacity, foresight, and firmness.  He\r\ncontrived to make himself acquainted beforehand with everything the\r\nJacobites were doing.  This, as may be seen by Bolingbroke's\r\ncomplaints, was easy enough at one time; but the adherents of James\r\nStuart began after a while to learn prudence, and some of their\r\nenterprises were conducted up to a certain point with much craft and\r\ncaution.  Lord Stair, however, always contrived to get the information\r\nhe wanted.  Some of the arts by which he accomplished his purposes were\r\nnot, perhaps, such as a great diplomatist of our time would have cared\r\nto practise.  He bribed with liberal hand; he kept persons of all kinds\r\nin his pay; he bribed French officials, and even French ministers; he\r\ngot to know all that was done in the most secret councils of the State.\r\nHe used to go about the capital in disguise in order to find out what\r\npeople were saying in the wine-shops and coffee-houses.  Often, after\r\nhe had entertained a brilliant company of guests at a state dinner, he\r\nwould make some excuse to his friends for quitting them abruptly; say\r\nthat he had received despatches which required his instant attention,\r\nleave the company to be entertained by his wife, withdraw to his study,\r\nthere quietly change his clothes, and then wander out on one of his\r\nnightly visitations of taverns and coffee-houses.  He paid court to\r\ngreat ladies, flattered them, allowed them to win money at cards from\r\nhim, and even made love to them, for the sake of getting some political\r\nsecrets out of them.  He had a noble and stately presence, a handsome\r\nface, and charming manners.  He is said to have been the most polite\r\nand well-bred man of his time.  It is of him the story is told about\r\nthe test of good-breeding which the King of France applied and\r\nacknowledged.  Louis the Fourteenth had heard it said that Stair was\r\nthe best-bred man of his day.  The {227} King invited Stair to drive\r\nout with him.  As they were about to enter the carriage the King signed\r\nto the English ambassador to go first.  Stair bowed and entered the\r\ncarriage.  \"The world is right about Lord Stair,\" said the King; \"I\r\nnever before saw a man who would not have troubled me with excuses and\r\nceremony.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1723--Spain]\r\n\r\nThe French Government naturally feared that the recall of Lord Stair\r\nmight be marked by a change in the friendly disposition of England.\r\nThis fear became greater on the death of Stanhope.  The English\r\nGovernment, however, took steps to reassure the Regent of France.\r\nTownshend himself wrote at once to Cardinal Dubois, promising to\r\nmaintain as before a cordial friendship with the French Government.\r\nWalpole was entirely imbued with the instincts of such a policy.  The\r\nchief disturbing influence in Continental politics arose from the\r\nanxiety of Spain to recover Gibraltar and Minorca, and, in fact, to get\r\nback again all that had been taken from her by the Treaty of Utrecht.\r\nThe territorial and other arrangements which concluded with the Treaty\r\nof Utrecht made themselves the central point of all the foreign policy\r\nof that time: these States were concerned to maintain the treaty; those\r\nwere eager to break through its bonds.  It holds in the politics of\r\nthat day the place which was held by the Treaty of Vienna at a later\r\nperiod.  There is always much of the hypocritical about the manner in\r\nwhich treaties of that highly artificial nature are made.  No State\r\nreally intends to hold by them any longer than she finds that they\r\nserve her own interests.  If they are imposed upon a State and are\r\ninjurious to her, that State never means to submit to them any longer\r\nthan she is actually under compulsion.  New means and impulses to break\r\naway from such bonds are given to those inclined that way, in the fact\r\nthat the arrangements are usually made without the slightest concern\r\nfor the populations of the countries concerned, but only for dynastic\r\nor other political considerations.  The pride of the Spanish people was\r\nso much hurt by some of the conditions of the Treaty {228} of Utrecht\r\nthat a Spanish sovereign or minister would always be popular who could\r\npoint to his people a way to escape from its bonds or to rend them in\r\npieces.  Spain, therefore, was always looking out for new alliances.\r\nShe saw at one time a fresh chance for trying her policy, and she held\r\nout every inducement in her power to the Emperor Charles the Sixth and\r\nto Russia to enter into a combination against France and England.  The\r\nEmperor was without a son, and, in consequence, had issued his famous\r\nPragmatic Sanction, providing that his hereditary dominions in Austria,\r\nHungary, and Bohemia should descend to his daughter Maria Theresa.  The\r\ngreat Powers of Europe had not as yet seen fit to guarantee, or even\r\nrecognize, this succession.  Spain held out the temptation to the\r\nEmperor of her own guarantee to the Pragmatic Sanction and of several\r\nimportant concessions in the matter of trade and commerce to Austria,\r\non consideration that the Emperor should assist Spain to recover her\r\nlost territory.  Catherine, the wife of Peter the Great, was now\r\ngoverning Russia, and was entering into secret negotiations with Spain\r\nand with the Emperor.  Townshend and Walpole understood all that was\r\ngoing on, and succeeded in making a defensive treaty between England,\r\nFrance, and Prussia.  Prussia, to be sure, did not long hold to the\r\ntreaty, and her withdrawal gave a new stimulus to the machinations of\r\nthe Emperor and of Philip of Spain, and in 1727 Philip actually\r\nventured to lay siege to Gibraltar.  England, France, and Holland,\r\nhowever, held firmly together; the Russian Empress suddenly died, the\r\nEmperor Charles was not inclined to risk much, and Spain finally had to\r\ncome to terms with England and her allies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1721--Anticipations of free-trade]\r\n\r\nThese troubles might have proved serious but for the determined policy\r\nof Townshend and of Walpole.  We have not thought it necessary to weary\r\nour readers with the details of this little running fire of dispute\r\nwhich was kept up for some years between England and Spain.  We saw in\r\nan earlier chapter how the quarrel began, and what {229} the elements\r\nwere which fed it and kept it burning.  This latter passage is really\r\nonly a continuation of the former; both, except for the sake of mere\r\ncontinuity of historic narrative, might have been told as one story,\r\nand, indeed, would perhaps not have required many sentences for the\r\ntelling.  Walpole applied himself at home to the work of what has since\r\nbeen called Peace, Retrenchment, and Reform.  He was the first great\r\nEnglish finance minister; perhaps we may say he was the first English\r\nminister who ever sincerely regarded the development of national\r\nprosperity, the just and equal distribution of taxation, and the\r\nlightening of the load of financial burdens, as the most important\r\nbusiness of a statesman.  The whole political and social conditions of\r\nthe country were changing under his wise and beneficent system of\r\nadministration.  Population was steadily increasing; some of the great\r\nrising towns had doubled their numbers since Walpole's career began.\r\nAgriculture was better in its systems, and was brightening the face of\r\nthe country everywhere; the farmer had almost ceased for the time to\r\ngrumble; the laborer was well fed and not too heavily worked.  We do\r\nnot mean to say that Walpole's administration was the one cause of all\r\nthis improvement in town and country, but most assuredly the peace, and\r\nthe security of peace, which Walpole's administration conferred was of\r\ndirect and material influence in the growing prosperity of the nation.\r\nHis financial systems lightened the burdens of taxation, distributed\r\nthe load more equally everywhere, and enabled the State to get the best\r\nrevenue possible at the lowest cost and with the least effort.  It\r\nmight almost be said that Walpole anticipated free-trade.  The Royal\r\nspeech from the Throne at the opening of Parliament, on October 19,\r\n1721, declared it to be \"very obvious that nothing would more conduce\r\nto the obtaining so public a good\"--the extension of our\r\ncommerce--\"than to make the exportation of our own manufactures, and\r\nthe importation of the commodities used in the manufacturing of them,\r\nas practicable and as easy as may be; by this means the balance {230}\r\nof trade may be preserved in our favor, our navigation increased, and\r\ngreater numbers of our poor employed.\"  \"I must, therefore,\" the speech\r\nwent on, \"recommend it to you, gentlemen of the House of Commons, to\r\nconsider how far the duties upon these branches may be taken off and\r\nreplaced, without any violation of public faith or laying any new\r\nburden upon my people; and I promise myself that, by a due\r\nconsideration of this matter, the produce of those duties, compared\r\nwith the infinite advantages that will accrue to the kingdom by their\r\nbeing taken off, will be found so inconsiderable as to leave little\r\nroom for any difficulties or objections.\"  In furtherance of the policy\r\nindicated in these passages of the Royal speech, more than one hundred\r\narticles of British manufacture were allowed to be exported free of\r\nduty, while some forty articles of raw material were allowed to be\r\nimported in the same manner.  Walpole was anxious to make a full use of\r\nthis system of indirect taxation.  He desired to levy and collect taxes\r\nin such a manner as to avoid the losses imposed upon the revenue by\r\nsmuggling and by various forms of fraud.  His principle was that the\r\nnecessaries of life and the raw materials from which our manufactures\r\nwere to be made ought to remain, as far as possible, free of taxation.\r\nThe whole history of our financial systems since Walpole's time has\r\nbeen a history of the gradual development of his economic principles.\r\nThere has been, of course, reaction now and then, and sometimes the\r\ncounsels of statesmen appear for a while to have been under the\r\nabsolute domination of the policy which he strove to supplant; but the\r\nreaction has only been for seasons, while the progress of Walpole's\r\npolicy has been steady.  We have now, in 1884, nearly accomplished the\r\nfinancial task Walpole would, if he could, have accomplished a century\r\nand a half earlier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1723--Parliamentary corruption]\r\n\r\nNo one can deny that Walpole was an unscrupulous minister.  He would\r\ngladly have carried out the best policy by the best means; but where\r\nthis was not practicable or convenient he was perfectly willing to\r\ncarry {231} out a noble policy by the vilest methods.  He was not\r\nhimself avaricious; he was not open to the temptations of money.  He\r\nhad a fortune large enough for him, and he spent it freely, but he was\r\nwilling to bribe and corrupt all those of whom he could make any use.\r\nUnder his rule corruption became a settled Parliamentary system.  He\r\nhad done more than any other man to make the House of Commons the most\r\npowerful factor in the government of England; he had therefore made a\r\nseat in the House of Commons an object of the highest ambition.  To sit\r\nin that House made the obscurest country gentleman a power in the\r\nState.  Naturally, therefore, a seat in the House of Commons was\r\nstruggled for, scrambled for, fought for--obtained at any cost of\r\nmoney, influence, time, and temper.  Naturally, also, a seat thus\r\nobtained was a possession through which recompense of some kind was\r\nexpected.  Those who buy their seats naturally expect to sell their\r\nvotes; at least that was so in the days of Walpole.  In times nearer to\r\nour own, England has seen a condition of things in which public opinion\r\nand the development of a sort of national conscience absolutely\r\nprevented members from taking bribes, although it allowed them the most\r\nliberal use of bribery and corruption in the obtaining of their seats.\r\nThe member of Parliament who, twenty or thirty years ago, would have\r\nbought his seat by means of the most unblushing and shameless\r\ncorruption, would no more have thought of selling his vote to a\r\nminister for a money payment than he would have thought of selling his\r\nwife at Smithfield.  But in Walpole's time the man who bought his seat\r\nwas ready to sell his vote.  Walpole, the minister, was willing to buy\r\nthe vote of any man who would sell it.  He was lavish in the gift of\r\nlucrative offices, of rich sinecures, of pensions, and even of bribes\r\nin a lump sum, money down.  He would bribe a member's wife, if that\r\nwere more convenient than openly to bribe the member himself.  He had\r\nno particular choice as to whether the bribe should be direct or\r\nindirect, open or secret; he {232} wanted to get the vote, he was\r\nwilling to pay the price, and he cared not who knew of the arrangement.\r\nWe have already mentioned that the saying ascribed to him about every\r\nman having his price was never uttered by him.  What he said probably\r\nwas, that \"each of these men,\" alluding to a certain group or party,\r\nhad his price.  He is reported to have said that he never knew any\r\nwoman who would not take money, except one noble lady, whom he named,\r\nand she, he said, took diamonds.  He acted consistently and was not\r\nashamed.  He was incorrupt himself; he was even in that sense\r\nincorruptible; but in order to gain his own public purposes, wise and\r\njust as they were, he was willing to corrupt a whole House of Commons,\r\nand would not have shrunk from corrupting a nation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1723--Lord Carteret]\r\n\r\nIt ought to be pointed out that the very pacific nature of Walpole's\r\npolicy and the security and steadiness of his administration made it\r\nsometimes all the more necessary for him to have recourse to\r\nquestionable methods.  Great controversies of imperial or national\r\ninterest--controversies which stir the hearts of men, which appeal to\r\ntheir principles and awaken their passions--did not often arise during\r\nhis long tenure of power.  Agitations of this kind, whatever trouble\r\nand disturbance they may bring with them, have a purifying effect upon\r\nthe political atmosphere.  Only a very ignoble creature is to be bribed\r\nout of his opinions when some interest is at stake, on which his heart,\r\nhis training, and his associations have already taught him to take\r\nsides.  Walpole kept the nation out of such controversies for the most\r\npart, and one result was that small political combinations of various\r\nkinds were free to form themselves around him, beneath him, and against\r\nhim.  The House of Commons sometimes threatened to dissolve itself into\r\na number of little separate sections or factions, none of them\r\nrepresenting any real principle or having more than a temporary\r\nattraction of cohesion.  Walpole was again and again placed in the\r\nposition of having to encounter {233} some little faction of this kind\r\nby open exercise of power or by the process of corruption, and he\r\nusually found the latter course more convenient and ready.  Nor could\r\nsuch a man at any period of English history have remained long without\r\nmore or less formidable rivals.  Walpole himself must have known well\r\nenough that the death of men like Sunderland, or the death or any\r\nnumber of men, could not, so long as England was herself, secure him\r\nfor long an undisturbed political field, with no head raised against\r\nhim.  A country like this is never so barren of political intellect and\r\ncourage as to admit of a long dictatorship in political life.\r\n\r\nWalpole had already one rising rival in the person of Lord Carteret,\r\nafterwards Earl of Granville.  John Carteret was born April 22, 1690,\r\nand was only five years old when the death of his father, the first\r\nLord Carteret, made him a member of the House of Lords.  He\r\ndistinguished himself greatly at Oxford, and entered very early into\r\npublic life.  He was from the beginning a favorite of George the First,\r\nand by the influence of Stanhope was intrusted with various diplomatic\r\nmissions of more or less importance.  In 1721 he was actually appointed\r\nambassador to the Court of France.  The death of Craggs, the Secretary\r\nof State, however, made a vacancy in the administration, and the place\r\nwas at once assigned to Carteret.  Carteret was one of those men whose\r\ngenius we have to believe in rather on the faith of contemporary\r\njudgment than by reason of any track of its own it has left behind.\r\nThe unanimous opinion of all who knew him, and more especially of those\r\nwho were commonly brought into contact with him, was that Carteret\r\npossessed the rarest combination of statesmanlike and literary gifts.\r\nProbably no English public man ever exhibited in a higher degree the\r\nqualities that bring success in politics and the qualities that bring\r\nsuccess in literature.  It seems strange to have to say this when one\r\nremembers a man like Bolingbroke and a man like Burke; but it is\r\ncertain that neither Bolingbroke nor Burke could {234} boast of such\r\nscholarship and accomplishments as those of Carteret.  [Sidenote:\r\n1723--Carteret's German] He was a profound classical scholar; he was a\r\nmaster of French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, German, and Swedish.\r\nHis scientific knowledge was extraordinary for that time; he was a\r\nclose student of the history of past and passing time; he was deeply\r\ninterested in constitutional law, and had a passion for Church history.\r\nHe was a great parliamentary debater--some say he was even a great\r\norator.  He was prompt and bold in his decisions; he was not afraid of\r\nany enterprise; he was not depressed or abashed by failure; he could\r\ntake fortune's buffets and rewards with equal thanks.  Large brains and\r\nsmall affections are, according to Mr. Disraeli, the essential\r\nqualities for success in public life.  Carteret had large brains and\r\nsmall affections; he had no friendships and no enmities.  Like Fox, he\r\nwas a bad hater, but, unlike Fox, he had not a heart to love.  He was\r\nfond of books and of wine and of women; he was a great drinker of wine,\r\neven for those days of deep drink.  Beneath all the apparent energy and\r\ndaring of his character there lay a voluptuous love of ease and\r\nlanguor.  He was not a lazy man, but his inclination was always to be\r\nan indolent man.  He leaped up to sudden political action when the call\r\ncame, like Sardanapalus leaping up to the inevitable fight; but, like\r\nSardanapalus, he would have been always glad to lie down again and loll\r\nin ease the moment the necessity for action had passed away.  No doubt\r\nhis daily allowance of Burgundy--a very liberal and generous\r\nallowance--had a good deal to do with his tendency to indolence.\r\nWhatever the reason, it is certain that, with all his magnificent gifts\r\nand his splendid chances, he did nothing great, and has left no abiding\r\nmark in history.  Every one who came near him seems to have regarded\r\nhis as a master-spirit.  Chesterfield said of him, \"When he dies, the\r\nablest head in England dies too, take it for all in all.\"  Horace\r\nWalpole declares him to be superior in one set of qualities to his\r\nfather.  Sir Robert Walpole, {235} and in others to the great Lord\r\nChatham.  \"Why did they send you here?\" Swift said to Carteret, with\r\nrough good-humor, when Carteret came over to Dublin to be\r\nLord-lieutenant of Ireland.  \"You are not fit for this place; let them\r\nsend us back our boobies.\"  Carteret's fame has always seemed to us\r\nlike the fame of Sheridan's Begum speech.  Such poor records as we have\r\nof that speech seem hardly to hint at any extraordinary eloquence; yet\r\nthe absolutely unanimous opinion of all that heard it--of all the\r\norators and statesmen and critics of the time--was that so great a\r\nspeech had never before been spoken in Parliament.  Those men can\r\nhardly have been all wrong, one would think; and yet, on the other\r\nhand, it is not easy to believe that those who made such record of the\r\nspeech as we have can have purposely left out all the eloquence, the\r\nwit, and the argument.  In like manner, readers of this day may perplex\r\nthemselves about the fame of Carteret.  All the men who knew him can\r\nhardly have been mistaken when they concurred in giving him credit for\r\nsurpassing genius; and yet we find no evidence of that genius either in\r\nthe literature or the political history of England.\r\n\r\nCarteret had one great advantage over Walpole and over all his\r\ncontemporaries in political life--he was able to speak German fluently;\r\nhe was able to talk for hours with the King in the King's own guttural\r\ntongue.  The King clung to Carteret's companionship because of his\r\nGerman.  While Walpole was trying to instil his policy and counsels\r\ninto George's mind through the non-conducting medium of very bad Latin,\r\nwhile other ministers were endeavoring to approach the Royal\r\nintelligence by means of French, which they spoke badly and he\r\nunderstood imperfectly, Carteret could rattle away in idiomatic German,\r\nand could amuse the Royal humor even with voluble German slang.\r\nCarteret had come into public life under the influence of Lord\r\nSunderland and Lord Stanhope, and he regarded himself as the successor\r\nto their policy.  He never considered himself as quite in {236}\r\nunderstanding and harmony with Townshend and Walpole.  His principal\r\nidea was that the time had passed when it was proper or expedient to\r\nexclude the Tories or the High-churchmen from the political service of\r\nthe Crown.  He desired to enlarge the basis of administration by\r\nadmitting some of the more plastic and progressive of the Tories to a\r\nshare in it.  There was, however, something more than a conflict of\r\npolitical views between Carteret and Walpole.  Walpole's ambition was\r\nto be the constitution dictator of England.  We do not say that this\r\nwas a mere personal ambition; on the contrary, we believe Walpole acted\r\non the honest conviction that he knew better than any other man how\r\nEngland ought to be governed.  He was sure, and reasonably sure, that\r\nno other statesman could play the game so well; he therefore claimed\r\nthe right to play it.  Carteret, on the other hand, was far too strong\r\na man to be quietly pushed into the background.  He was determined that\r\nif he remained in the service of the State he would be a statesman, and\r\nnot a clerk.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1723--A match making intrigue]\r\n\r\nTherefore, while Carteret and Walpole were colleagues there was always\r\na struggle going on between them, and, like all the political struggles\r\nof the time, it had a great deal of underhand influence, and the worst\r\nkind of petticoat influence, engaged in it.  One of the King's\r\nmistresses--the most influential of them--gave all her support to\r\nWalpole; another Royal paramour lent her aid to Carteret's side.\r\nCarteret played into the King's hands as regarded the Hanoverian\r\npolicy, and was for taking strong measures against Russia.  Townshend\r\nand Walpole would hear of no schemes which threatened to entangle\r\nEngland in war for the sake of Hanoverian interests.  George liked\r\nCarteret, and was captivated by his policy as well as by his personal\r\nqualities, but he could not help seeing that Townshend's advice was the\r\nsounder, and that no man could manage the finances like Walpole.\r\nGeorge went to Hanover in the summer of 1723, and both the Secretaries\r\nof State went with him.  This was {237} something unusual, and even\r\nunprecedented; but the King would not do without the companionship of\r\nCarteret, and knew that he could not do without the advice of\r\nTownshend.  So both Townshend and Carteret went with his Majesty to\r\nHerrenhausen, and Walpole had the whole business of administration in\r\nhis own hands at home.\r\n\r\nA very paltry and pitiful intrigue at length settled the question\r\nbetween Townshend and Carteret.  A marriage had been arranged between a\r\nniece, or so-called niece, of one of George's mistresses and the son of\r\nLa Vrillière, the French Secretary of State.  Madame La Vrillière\r\ninsisted, as a condition of the marriage, that her husband should be\r\nmade a duke, and it was assumed that this could be brought about by the\r\ninfluence of the English Government.  King George was anxious that the\r\nmarriage should take place, and Carteret, of course, was willing to\r\nassist him.  The English ambassador at the Court of France was a man\r\nnamed Sir Luke Schaub, by birth a Swiss, who had been Stanhope's\r\nsecretary, and by Stanhope's influence was pushed up in the diplomatic\r\nservice.  Sir Luke Schaub was in close understanding with Carteret, and\r\nwas strongly hostile to Townshend and Walpole.  Of this fact Townshend\r\nwas well aware, and he took care that Schaub should be closely watched\r\nin Paris.  Schaub was instructed by Carteret to do all he could in\r\norder to obtain the dukedom for Madame La Vrillière's husband.\r\nCardinal Dubois died, and his place in the councils of the Duke of\r\nOrleans was taken by Count Nocé, who was believed to be hostile to\r\nEngland.  This fact gave Townshend an excuse for suggesting to the King\r\nthat some one should be sent to Paris to watch over the action of the\r\nFrench Government and the conduct of the English ambassador, \"in such a\r\nmanner,\" so Townshend wrote from Hanover to Walpole, \"as may neither\r\nhurt Sir Luke Schaub's credit with the Duke of Orleans, nor create a\r\njealousy in Sir Luke of the King's intending to withdraw his confidence\r\nfrom him.\"  This was, of course, exactly what Townshend wanted to\r\ndo--to {238} induce the King to withdraw his confidence from poor Sir\r\nLuke.  The King agreed that it was necessary some one \"in whose\r\nfidelity and dexterity he can depend\" should set out from England to\r\nHanover, \"and take Paris on his way hither, under pretence of a\r\ncuriosity to see that place, and without owning to any one living the\r\nbusiness he is employed in.\"  The person selected for this somewhat\r\ndelicate mission was Horace Walpole, Robert Walpole's only surviving\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1724--Carteret goes to Ireland]\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole acquitted himself very cleverly of the task assigned to\r\nhim.  He was a man of uncouth manners, but of some shrewd ability and\r\nof varied experience.  He had been a soldier with Stanhope before\r\nacting as Under-Secretary of State to Townshend; he had managed to\r\ndistinguish himself in Parliament and in diplomacy.  He soon contrived\r\nto obtain the ear of the Duke of Orleans, and he found that Sir Luke\r\nSchaub had been deceiving himself and his sovereign about the prospect\r\nof La Vrillière's dukedom.  Philip of Orleans told Horace Walpole\r\nfrankly that there never was the slightest idea of giving such a\r\ndukedom, and added that the dignity of France would be compromised if\r\nsuch a concession were made in order to enable the King of England \"to\r\nmarry his bastard daughter\"--so the Duke put it--into the French\r\n_noblesse_.  Sir Luke Schaub's haste and indiscreet zeal had, in fact,\r\nbrought his sovereign into discredit, and even compromised the good\r\nunderstanding between England and France.\r\n\r\nPhilip of Orleans died almost immediately.  His death was sudden, but\r\nhe had long run a course which set all laws of health at defiance.  He\r\nstuck to his pleasures to the very last--died, one might say, in\r\nharness.  His successor in the administration of France, under the\r\nyoung King Louis the Fifteenth, who had just been declared of age, was\r\nthe Duke de Bourbon, Philip's equal, perhaps, in profligacy, but not by\r\nany means his equal in capacity.  Horace Walpole won over the new\r\nadministrator.  The Duke de Bourbon told him that Sir Luke Schaub was\r\n{239} obnoxious to every one in the French Court, and that he was not\r\nfit, by birth, breeding, or capacity, to represent England there.\r\n\r\nWe need not follow the intrigue through all its turns and twists.\r\nWalpole and Townshend succeeded.  Schaub was recalled; Horace Walpole\r\nwas appointed ambassador in his place.  The recall of Schaub involved\r\nthe fall of Carteret.  Carteret, however, was not a man to be rudely\r\nthrust out of office, and a soft fall was therefore prepared for him;\r\nhe was made Lord-lieutenant of Ireland.  He knew that he was defeated.\r\nThen, as at a later day and at an earlier, the Viceroyalty of Ireland\r\nwas the gilding which enabled a man to gulp down the bitter pill of\r\npolitical failure.  When Lord John Russell obtained the dismissal of\r\nLord Palmerston from his cabinet in 1851, he endeavored, somewhat\r\nawkwardly, to soften the blow by offering to his dispossessed rival the\r\nposition of Lord-lieutenant of Ireland.  Lord Palmerston understood the\r\nmeaning of the offer, and treated it--as was but natural--with open\r\ncontempt.  Carteret acted otherwise.  Probably he felt within himself\r\nthat he was not destined to a great political career.  In any case, he\r\naccepted the offer with perfect good-humor, declaring that, on the\r\nwhole, he thought he should be much more pleasantly situated as a\r\ndictator in Dublin than as the servant of a dictator in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{240}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE DRAPIER'S LETTERS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1724--Wood's coinage]\r\n\r\nLord Carteret arrived at the seat of his Viceroyalty in the midst of a\r\npolitical storm which threatened at one time to blow down a good many\r\nshaky institutions.  He found the whole country, and especially the\r\ncapital, convulsed by an agitation the like of which was not seen again\r\nuntil the days of Grattan and the Volunteers.  The hero of the\r\nagitation was Swift; the spell-words which gave it life and direction\r\nwere found in \"The Drapier's Letters.\"\r\n\r\nThe copper coinage of Ireland had been for a long time deficient.\r\nEmployers of labor had in many cases been obliged to pay their workmen\r\nin tokens; sometimes even with pieces of card, stamped and signed, and\r\nrepresenting each a small amount.  During Sunderland's time of power,\r\nthe Government set themselves to work to supply the lack of copper, and\r\ninvited tenders from the owners of mines for the supply.  A Mr. William\r\nWood, a man who owned iron and copper mines, and iron and copper works,\r\nsent in a tender which was accepted.  A patent was given to Wood\r\npermitting him to coin halfpence and farthings to the value of one\r\nhundred and eight thousand pounds.  Walpole had not approved of the\r\nscheme himself, but for various reasons he did not venture to upset it.\r\nHe had the patent prepared, and consulted Sir Isaac Newton, then Master\r\nof the Mint, with regard to the objects which the Government had in\r\nview, and the weight and fineness of the coin which Wood was to supply.\r\nThe halfpence and farthings were to be a little less in weight than the\r\ncoin of the same kind {241} current in England.  Walpole considered\r\nthis necessary because of the difference in exchange between the two\r\ncountries.  Sir Isaac Newton was of opinion that the Irish coin\r\nexceeded the English in fineness of metal.  As to the King's\r\nprerogative for granting such patents, Walpole himself explained in a\r\nletter to Lord Townshend, then in Hanover with the King, that it was\r\none never disputed and often exercised.  The granting of this patent,\r\nand the mode of supplying the deficiency in copper coin, might seem\r\nlittle open to objection; but the Irish Privy Council at once declared\r\nagainst the whole transaction.  Both Houses of the Irish Parliament\r\npassed addresses to the King, declaring that the introduction of Wood's\r\ncoinage would be injurious to the revenue and positively destructive of\r\ntrade.  The Irish Lord Chancellor set himself sternly against the\r\npatent in private, and urged all his friends, comrades, and dependents,\r\nto act publicly against it.  The addresses from the two Houses of\r\nParliament were sent to Walpole, who transmitted them to Lord\r\nTownshend.  Walpole accompanied the addresses with an explanation in\r\nwhich he vindicated the policy represented by the granting of the\r\npatent, and insisted that no harm whatever could be done to the trade\r\nor revenue of Ireland by the introduction of the new copper coinage.\r\nWalpole advised that the King should return a soothing and a\r\nconciliatory reply to the addresses, and the King acted accordingly.\r\nIt seemed at one time probable that a satisfactory compromise would be\r\narranged between the Irish Parliament and King George's ministers.\r\nThis hope, however, was soon dispelled.\r\n\r\nOne objection felt by the Irish people in general to the patent and the\r\nnew coinage was founded on the discovery of the fact that Wood had\r\nagreed to pay a large bribe to the Duchess of Kendal for her influence\r\nin obtaining the patent for him.  The objection of the Irish Executive\r\nand the Irish Parliament was mainly based on the fact that Dublin had\r\nnot been consulted in the arrangement of the business.  The ministers\r\nin London {242} settled the whole affair, and then simply communicated\r\nthe nature of the arrangement to Dublin.  Wood himself was unpopular,\r\nso far as anything could be known of him, in Ireland.  He was a\r\nstranger to Ireland, and he was represented to be a boastful, arrogant\r\nman, who went about saying he could do anything he liked with Walpole,\r\nand that he would cram his copper coins down the throats of the Irish\r\npeople.  All these objections, however, might have been got over but\r\nfor the sudden appearance of an unexpected and a powerful actor on the\r\nscene.  One morning appeared in Dublin \"A letter to the shopkeepers,\r\ntradesmen, farmers, and common people of Ireland, concerning the brass\r\nhalfpence coined by one William Wood, hardwareman, with a design to\r\nhave them pass in this kingdom; wherein is shown the power of his\r\npatent, the value of his halfpence, and how far every person may be\r\nobliged to take the same in payments; and how to behave himself in case\r\nsuch an attempt should be made by Wood or any other person.\"  The\r\nletter was signed \"M. B., Drapier.\"  This was the first of those famous\r\n\"Drapier's Letters\" which convulsed Ireland with a passion like that\r\npreceding a great popular insurrection.  It may be questioned whether\r\nthe pamphlets of a literary politician ever before or since worked with\r\nso powerful an influence on the mind of a nation as these marvellous\r\nletters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1724--Swift's sincerity]\r\n\r\nThe author of \"The Drapier's Letters,\" we need hardly say, was Dean\r\nSwift.  Swift had for some years withdrawn himself from the political\r\nworld.  He is described by one of his biographers as having \"amused\r\nhimself for three or four years with poetry, conversation, and\r\ntrifles.\"  Now and then, however, he published some letter which showed\r\nhis interest in the condition of the people among whom he lived; his\r\nproposal, for example, \"for the universal use of Irish manufacture in\r\nclothes and furniture of houses, etc.,\" was written in the year 1720.\r\nThis letter--the printer of which was subjected to a Government\r\nprosecution--contains a passage which has been, perhaps, {243} more\r\noften and more persistently misquoted than any other observation of any\r\nauthor we can now remember.  It seems to have become an article of\r\nfaith with many writers and most readers that Swift said, \"Burn\r\neverything that comes from England, except its coals.\"  Without much\r\nhope of correcting that false impression so far as the bulk of the\r\nreading and quoting public is concerned, we may observe that Swift\r\nnever said anything of the kind.  This is what he did say: \"I heard the\r\nlate Archbishop of Tuam mention a pleasant observation of somebody's\r\nthat 'Ireland would never be happy until a law were made for burning\r\neverything that came from England, except their people and their\r\ncoals.'  I must confess that, as to the former, I should not be sorry\r\nif they would stay at home, and, for the latter, I hope in a little\r\ntime we shall have no occasion for them.\"  Swift was not an Irish\r\npatriot; he was not, indeed, an Irishman at all, except by the accident\r\nof birth, and now by the accident of residence.  He did not love the\r\ncountry; he would not have lived there a week if he could.  He had no\r\naffection for the people, and, at first, very little sympathy with\r\nthem.  He was always angry if anybody regarded him as an Irishman.  His\r\nfriends were all found among what may be described as the English and\r\nProtestant colony in Ireland.  He felt towards the native Irish--the\r\nIrish Catholics--very much as the official of an English Government\r\nmight feel towards some savage tribe whom he had been sent out to\r\ngovern.  But at the same time it is an entire mistake to represent\r\nSwift as insincere in the efforts which he made to ameliorate the\r\ncondition of the Irish people, and to redress some of the gross wrongs\r\nwhich he saw inflicted on them.  The administrator of whom we have\r\nalready spoken might have gone out to the savage country with nothing\r\nbut contempt for its wild natives, but if he were at all a humane and a\r\njust man, it would be natural for him as time went on to feel keenly if\r\nany injustice were inflicted on the poor creatures whom he despised,\r\nand at last to stand up {244} with indignation as their defender and\r\ntheir champion.  So it was with Swift.  [Sidenote: 1724--The drapier's\r\narguments] Little as he liked the Irish people in the beginning, yet he\r\nhad a temper and a spirit which made him intolerant of injustice and\r\noppression.  That fierce indignation described by himself, and of which\r\nsuch store was always laid up in his heart, was roused to its highest\r\npoint of heat by the sight of the miseries of the Irish people and of\r\nthe frequent acts of neglect and injustice by which their misery was\r\ndeepened.  He felt the most sincere resentment at the arbitrary manner\r\nin which the Government in London were dealing with Ireland in the\r\nmatter of Wood's patent and Wood's copper coin.  Swift, of course, knew\r\nwell by what influence the patent had been obtained, and he knew that\r\nwhen obtained it had been simply thrust upon the Irish authorities,\r\nParliament, and people without any previous sanction or knowledge on\r\ntheir part.  Very likely he was also convinced, or had convinced\r\nhimself, that the patent and the new coin would be injurious to the\r\nrevenues and the trade of the country.  Certainly, if he was not\r\nconvinced of this, he gave to all his diatribes against Wood, Wood's\r\npatent, and Wood's halfpence the tones of profoundest conviction.  He\r\nassumed the character of a draper for the moment--why he chose to spell\r\ndraper \"drapier\" nobody knew--and he certainly succeeded in putting on\r\nall the semblance of an honest trader driven to homely and robust\r\nindignation by an impudent proposal to injure the business of himself\r\nand his neighbors.  In England, he says, \"the halfpence and farthings\r\npass for very little more than they are worth, and if you should beat\r\nthem to pieces and sell them to the brazier, you would not lose much\r\nabove a penny in a shilling.\"  But he goes on to say that Mr. Wood,\r\nwhom he describes as \"a mean, ordinary man, a hardware dealer\"--Wood\r\nwas, as we have already seen, a large owner of iron and copper mines\r\nand works, but that was all one to Dean Swift--\"made his halfpence of\r\nsuch base metal, and so much smaller than the English ones, that the\r\nbrazier would hardly give you {245} above a penny of good money for a\r\nshilling of his; so that this sum of one hundred and eight thousand\r\npounds in good gold and silver may be given for trash that will not be\r\nworth above eight or nine thousand pounds real value.\"  Nor is even\r\nthis the worst, he contends, \"for Mr. Wood, when he pleases, may by\r\nstealth send over another hundred and eight thousand pounds and buy all\r\nour goods for eleven parts in twelve under the value.\"  \"For example,\"\r\nsays Swift, \"if a hatter sells a dozen of hats for five shillings\r\napiece, which amounts to three pounds, and receives the payment in\r\nWood's coin, he really receives only the value of five shillings.\"  Of\r\ncourse this is the wildest exaggeration--is, in fact, mere extravagance\r\nand absurdity, if regarded as a financial proposition.  But Swift\r\nunderstood, as hardly any other man understood, the art of employing\r\nexaggeration with such an effect as to make it do the business of\r\nunquestionable fact.  He was able to make his literary coins pass for\r\nmuch more than Wood could do with his halfpence and farthings.  The\r\nartistic skill which bade the creatures whom Gulliver saw in his\r\ntravels seem real, life-like, and living, made the fantastic\r\nextravagance of the \"Drapier's Letters\" strike home with all the force\r\nof truth to the minds of an excited populace.\r\n\r\nMany biographers and historians have expressed a blank and utter\r\namazement at the effect which Swift's letters produced.  They have\r\nchosen to regard it as a mere historical curiosity, a sort of political\r\nparadox and puzzle.  They have described the Irish people at the time\r\nas under the spell of something like sorcery.  Even in our own days,\r\nMr. Gladstone, in a speech delivered to the House of Commons, treated\r\nthe convulsion caused by Swift's letters and Wood's halfpence as an\r\noutbreak of national frenzy, called up by the witchery of style\r\ndisplayed in the \"Drapier's Letters.\"  To some of us it is, on the\r\nother hand, a matter of surprise to see how capable writers, and\r\nespecially how a man of Mr. Gladstone's genius and political knowledge,\r\ncould for a moment be thus deceived.  {246} One is almost inclined to\r\nthink that Mr. Gladstone could not have been reading the \"Drapier's\r\nLetters\" recently, when he thus spoke of the effect which they\r\nproduced, and thus was willing to explain it.  [Sidenote: 1724--The\r\ndrapier's victory] Any one who reads the letters with impartial\r\nattention will see that from first to last the anger that burns in\r\nthem, the sarcasm that withers and scorches, the passionate eloquence\r\nwhich glows in even their most carefully measured sentences, are\r\ndirected against Wood and his halfpence only because the patent, the\r\nbribe by which it was purchased, and the manner in which it was forced\r\non Ireland, represented the injustice of the whole system of Irish\r\nadministration, and the wrongs of many generations.  \"It would be very\r\nhard if all Ireland,\" Swift declares with indignation, \"should be put\r\ninto one scale, and this sorry fellow Wood into the other.\"  \"I have a\r\npretty good shop of Irish stuffs and silks,\" the Drapier declares, \"and\r\ninstead of taking Mr. Wood's bad copper, I intend to truck with my\r\nneighbors, the butchers and bakers and brewers, and the rest, goods for\r\ngoods; and the little gold and silver I have, I will keep by me like my\r\nheart's blood till better times, or until I am just ready to starve.\"\r\n\"Wood's contract?\" he asks.  \"His contract with whom?  Was it with the\r\nParliament or people of Ireland?\"  The reader who believes that such a\r\npassage as that, and scores of similar passages, were inspired merely\r\nby disapproval of the introduction of one hundred and eight thousand\r\npounds in copper coin, must have very little understanding of Swift's\r\ntemper or Swift's purpose, or the condition of the times in which Swift\r\nlived.  \"I will shoot Mr. Wood and his deputies through the head, like\r\nhighwaymen or house-breakers, if they dare to force one farthing of\r\ntheir coin on me in the payment of a hundred pounds.  It is no loss of\r\nhonor to submit to the lion, but who in the figure of a man can think\r\nwith patience of being devoured alive by a rat?\" . . . \"If the famous\r\nMr. Hampden rather chose to go to prison than pay a few shillings to\r\nKing Charles I., without authority of Parliament, I will {247} rather\r\nchoose to be hanged than have all my substance taxed at seventeen\r\nshillings in the pound, at the arbitrary will and pleasure of the\r\nvenerable Mr. Wood.\"  Mr. Gladstone, perhaps, did not observe this\r\nallusion to \"the famous Mr. Hampden.\"  If he had done so, he would have\r\nbetter understood the inspiration of the \"Drapier's Letters.\"  Mr.\r\nHampden was not so ignorant a man as to believe that the mere\r\ncollection of the ship-money--the mere withdrawal of so much money from\r\nthe pockets of certain tax-payers--would really ruin the trade and\r\nimperil the national existence of England.  What Mr. Hampden objected\r\nto, and would have resisted to the death, was the unconstitutional and\r\ndespotic system which the levy of the ship-money represented.  The\r\nAmerican colonists did not rise in rebellion against the Government of\r\nGeorge III. merely because they had eaten of the insane root, and\r\nfancied that a trifling tax upon tea would destroy the trade of Boston\r\nand New York.  They rose in arms against the principle represented by\r\nthe imposition of the tax.  We can all understand why there should have\r\nbeen a national rebellion against ship-money, and a national rebellion\r\nagainst a trumpery duty on tea, but English writers and English public\r\nmen seem quite unable to explain the national outcry against Wood's\r\npatent, except on the theory that a clever writer, pouring forth\r\ncaptivating nonsense, bewitched the Irish Parliament and the Irish\r\npeople, and sent them out of their senses for a season.\r\n\r\nSwift followed up his first letter by others in rapid succession.  Lord\r\nCarteret arrived in Ireland when the agitation was at its height.  He\r\nissued a proclamation against the \"Drapier's Letters,\" offered a reward\r\nof three hundred pounds for the discovery of the author, and had the\r\nprinter arrested.  The Grand Jury, however, unanimously threw out the\r\nbill sent up against Harding, the printer.  Another Grand Jury passed a\r\npresentment against all persons who should by fraud or otherwise impose\r\nWood's copper coins upon the public.  This {248} presentment is said to\r\nhave been drawn up by Swift's own hand.  Lord Carteret at last had the\r\ngood-sense to perceive, and the spirit to acknowledge, that there was\r\nno alternative between concession and rebellion.  He strongly urged his\r\nconvictions on the Government, and the Government had the wisdom to\r\nyield.  The patent was withdrawn, a pension was given to Wood in\r\nconsideration of the loss he had sustained, and Swift was the object of\r\nuniversal gratitude, enthusiasm, love, and devotion, on the part of the\r\nIrish nation.  Many a patriotic Irishman would fain believe to this\r\nvery day that Swift, too, was Irish, and an Irish patriot.  Ireland\r\ncertainly has not yet forgotten, probably never will forget, the\r\nsuccessful stand made by Swift against what he believed to be an insult\r\nto the Irish nation, when he took up his pen to write the first of the\r\nDrapier's immortal Letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{249}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE OPPOSITION.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1725--Troubles in Scotland]\r\n\r\nThe trouble had hardly been got rid of in Ireland by Carteret's\r\njudicious advice and the withdrawal of Wood's patent when a commotion\r\nthat at one time threatened to be equally serious broke out in\r\nScotland.  English members of Parliament had been for many years\r\ncomplaining that Scotland was exempt from any taxation on malt.  Up to\r\nthat time no Government had attempted to take any steps towards\r\nestablishing equality in this respect between the two countries.\r\nWalpole now strove to deal with the question.  It was proposed in the\r\nHouse of Commons that instead of a malt duty in Scotland a duty of\r\nsixpence should be levied on every barrel of ale.  Walpole at first was\r\nnot inclined to deal with the difficulty in this way, but as the\r\nfeeling of the House was very strongly in favor of making some attempt,\r\nhe consented to adopt the principle suggested, but required that the\r\nduty should be threepence instead of sixpence.  The moment it became\r\nknown in Scotland that any tax on malt or ale was to be imposed,\r\nrioting began in the principal cities; the spirit of the national motto\r\nasserted itself--\"nemo me impune lacessit.\"  The ringleaders of various\r\nmobs were arrested and sent for trial, but the Scotch juries, following\r\nthe recent example of the Irish, refused to convict.  Brewers all over\r\nScotland entered into a sort of league, by virtue of which they pledged\r\nthemselves not to give any securities for the new duty and to cease\r\nbrewing if the Government exacted it.  Unluckily for Walpole, the\r\nSecretary of State for Scotland, the Duke of Roxburgh, was a great\r\nfriend of Carteret's, {250} and had joined with Carteret in endeavoring\r\nto thwart Walpole in all his undertakings.  The success of Walpole's\r\npolicy in any instance was understood by Carteret and by Roxburgh to\r\nmean Walpole's supremacy over all other ministers.  The Duke of\r\nRoxburgh therefore took advantage of the crisis in Scotland to injure\r\nthe administration, and especially to injure Walpole.  In a subtle and\r\nunderhand way he contrived to favor and foment the disturbance.  He\r\ntook care that the orders of the Government should not be too quickly\r\ncarried out, and he gave more than a tacit encouragement to the common\r\nrumor that the King in his heart was hostile to the new tax, that the\r\ntax was wholly an invention of Walpole's, and that resistance to such a\r\nmeasure would not be unwelcome to the Sovereign, and would lead to the\r\ndismissal of the minister.  Walpole was not long in finding out the\r\ntreachery of the Duke of Roxburgh.  To adopt a homely phrase, he \"took\r\nthe bull by the horns\" at once.  Lord Townshend was in Hanover with the\r\nKing, and Walpole wrote to Lord Townshend, giving him a full account of\r\nall that was going on in Scotland, and laying the chief blame for the\r\ncontinuance of the disturbance on the Duke of Roxburgh.  \"I beg leave\r\nto observe,\" wrote Walpole, \"that the present administration is the\r\nfirst that was ever yet known to be answerable for the whole\r\nGovernment, with a Secretary of State for one part of the kingdom who,\r\nthey are assured, acts counter to all their measures, or at least whom\r\nthey cannot confide in.\"  His remonstrance had to be pressed again and\r\nagain upon Townshend before anything was done to satisfy him.  Walpole,\r\nhowever, was a man to press where he thought the occasion demanded it,\r\nand he was successful in the end.  The Duke of Roxburgh had to resign,\r\nand Walpole added to his own duties those of the Secretary of State for\r\nScotland.  He appointed, however, as his agent or deputy in the\r\nadministration of Scotland, the Earl of Isla, Lord-keeper of the Privy\r\nSeal in that country, and a man on whose allegiance he could entirely\r\nrely.  Having {251} thus secured a full power to act, Walpole was not\r\nlong in bringing the disturbances to an end.  He displayed both\r\ndiscretion and resolve.  He was able to satisfy the most reasonable\r\namong the brewers and maltsters that their interests would not really\r\nsuffer by the proposed resolutions.  The natural result was that the\r\ncombination of brewers began to melt away.  The brewers held a meeting,\r\nand it was soon found that it would not be possible to secure a general\r\nresolution to meet the legislation of the Government by passive\r\nresistance and by ceasing to brew.  As all would not stand together,\r\nevery man was left to take his own course, and the result was that what\r\nwe should now call a strike came quietly to an end.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1725--Intrigue and counter-intrigue]\r\n\r\nA modern reader is naturally shocked and surprised at the manner in\r\nwhich members of the same Government in Walpole's day intrigued against\r\none another, and strove to thwart each other's policy.  No actual\r\ndefence is to be made for such a practice; but it is only fair to\r\nobserve that up to Walpole's own entrance into office, and after it,\r\nthe habit of English sovereigns had been to make up an administration\r\nby taking members of different and even of opposing parties and\r\nbringing them together, in the hope of securing thereby the\r\nco-operation of all parties.  Under these circumstances it was natural,\r\nit was only to be expected, that the minister who was pledged to one\r\npolicy would endeavor by all means in his power to counteract the\r\ndesigns of the minister whom he knew to be pledged to a very different\r\nkind of policy.  Nor, indeed, is the practice of intrigue and\r\ncounter-intrigue among members of the same cabinet actually unknown in\r\nour own days, when there is not the same excuse to be pleaded for it\r\nthat might have been urged in the time of Walpole.  In the case of the\r\nDuke of Roxburgh, however, the attempt to counteract the policy of\r\nWalpole was made in somewhat bolder and less subtle fashion than was\r\ncommon even in those days, and Walpole was well justified in the course\r\nhe took.  For once his high-handed way of dealing with men was\r\nvindicated {252} by its principle and by the unqualified advantage it\r\nbrought to the interests of the State and to those of the minister as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1725--Dictatorship overdone]\r\n\r\nThe student of history derives one satisfaction from the frequent\r\nvisits of King George to Hanover.  The correspondence between Walpole\r\nand Townshend which was made necessary by those visits gives us many an\r\ninteresting glimpse into political affairs in their reality, in their\r\nundress, in their secret movement, which no ordinary State papers or\r\ndiplomatic despatches could be trusted to give.  The Secretary of State\r\noften communicates to the representative of his country at some foreign\r\ncourt only just that view of a political situation which he wishes to\r\nput under the eyes of the foreign sovereign and foreign statesmen.  But\r\nWalpole writes to Townshend exactly what he himself believes, and what\r\nit is important both to Townshend and to him that Townshend shall fully\r\nknow.  \"I think,\" Walpole says to Townshend, in one of his letters, \"we\r\nhave once more got Ireland and Scotland quiet, if we take care to keep\r\nthem so.\"  Exactly; if only care be taken to keep them so.  The same\r\nchance had often been given to English statesmen before; Ireland and\r\nScotland quiet, and might have continued in quietness if care had only\r\nbeen taken to keep them so.\r\n\r\nThe King was much pleased with Walpole's success.  He made him one of\r\nthe thirty-eight Knights of the Bath.  The Order of the Bath had gone\r\nout of use, out of existence in fact, since the coronation of Charles\r\nthe Second; George the First revived it in 1725, and bestowed its\r\nhonors on Walpole.  It seems an odd sort of reward for the shrewd,\r\npractical, and somewhat coarse-fibred squire-statesman.  The close\r\nconnection between man and the child, civilized man and the savage, is\r\nnever more clearly illustrated than in the joy and pride which the\r\nwisest statesman feels in the wearing of a ribbon or a star.  In the\r\nnext year the King made Walpole a Knight of the Garter; after this\r\nhonor all other mark of dignity {253} would be but an anti-climax.\r\nFrom the time of his introduction to the Order of the Bath, the great\r\nminister ceased to be plain Mr. Walpole, and became Sir Robert Walpole.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, under Walpole's Order of the Bath, many a throb of pain must\r\nhave made itself felt.  The minister began to find himself harassed by\r\nthe most formidable opposition that had ever set itself against him.\r\nLord Carteret was out of the way for the moment--and only for the\r\nmoment; but Pulteney proved a much more pertinacious, ingenious, and\r\ndangerous enemy than Carteret had hitherto been.  Pulteney was at one\r\ntime the faithful follower, the enthusiastic admirer, almost the\r\ndevotee, of Walpole.  The one great political defect of Walpole filled\r\nhim with faults.  He could not bear the idea of a divided rule; he\r\nwould be all or nothing; he would have clerks and servants for his\r\ncolleagues in office; not real ministers, actual statesmen.  He was\r\nunder the mistaken impression that a man of genius is to be reduced to\r\ntame insignificance by merely keeping him out of important office.  He\r\nhad made this mistake with regard to Carteret; he made it now with\r\nregard to Pulteney.  The consequences were far more serious; for\r\nPulteney was neither so good-humored nor so indolent as Carteret, and\r\nhe could not be put aside.\r\n\r\nPulteney was a man of singular eloquence, and of eloquence peculiarly\r\nadapted to the House of Commons.  His style was brilliant, incisive,\r\nand penetrating.  He could speak on any subject at the spur of the\r\nmoment.  He never delivered a set speech.  He was a born parliamentary\r\ndebater.  All his resources seemed to be at instant command, according\r\nas he had need of them.  His reading was wide, deep, and varied; he was\r\na most accomplished classical scholar, and had a marvellous readiness\r\nand aptitude for classical allusion.  He was a wit and a humorist; he\r\ncould brighten the dullest topics and make them sparkle by odd and\r\ndroll illustrations, as well as by picturesque allusions and eloquent\r\nphrases.  He {254} could, when the subject called for it, break\r\nsuddenly into thrilling invective.  [Sidenote: 1725--Pulteney] But he\r\nhad some of the defects of the extemporaneous orator.  His eloquence,\r\nhis wit, his epigrams often carried him away from his better judgment.\r\nHe frequently committed himself to some opinion which was not really\r\nhis, and was led far from his proper position in the pursuit of some\r\nparadox or by the charm of some fantastic idea.  He was a brilliant\r\nwriter as well as a brilliant speaker.  His private character would\r\nhave little blame if it were not that a fondness for money kept growing\r\nwith his growing years.  \"For a good old-gentlemanly vice,\" says Byron,\r\n\"I think I must take up with avarice.\"  Pulteney did not even wait to\r\nbe an old gentleman to take up with \"the good old-gentlemanly vice.\"\r\nWe have in some measure now to take his talents on trust, as we have\r\nthose of Carteret.  He proved to be little more than the comet of a\r\nseason; when he had gone, he left no line of light behind him.  But it\r\nis certain that in the estimation of his contemporaries he was one of\r\nthe most gifted men of his time; and for a while he was the most\r\npopular man in England--the darling and the hero of the multitude.\r\nWhen Walpole was sent to the Tower in the late Queen's reign, Pulteney\r\nhad spoken up manfully for his friend.  When Townshend and Walpole\r\nresigned office in 1717, Pulteney went resolutely with them and\r\nresigned office also.  The time came when Walpole found himself\r\ntriumphant over all his enemies, and came back not merely to office but\r\nlikewise to power.  Naturally, Pulteney expected that Walpole would\r\ninvite him to fill some place of importance in the new administration.\r\nWalpole did nothing of the kind.  He had seen ample evidence of\r\nPulteney's great parliamentary talents in the mean time, and he feared\r\nthat with Pulteney for an official colleague he could never be a\r\ndictator.  He was anxious, however, not to offend Pulteney, and he had\r\nthe curious weakness to imagine that he could conciliate Pulteney by\r\noffering him a peerage.  Even at that time, when the sceptre of popular\r\npower had not yet {255} passed altogether into the hands of the\r\nrepresentative chamber, it was absurd to suppose that Pulteney would\r\nconsent to be withdrawn from the House in which he had made his fame,\r\nwhich was his natural and fitting place, and which already was seen by\r\nevery man of sense to be the central force of England's political life.\r\nPulteney contemptuously refused the peerage.  From that hour his old\r\nlove for Walpole seems to have turned into hate.\r\n\r\nThe explosion, however, did not come at once.  Pulteney continued to be\r\non seemingly good terms with Walpole, and shortly afterwards the\r\ncomparatively humble post of Cofferer to the Household was offered to\r\nhim--some say was asked for by him.  It does not seem likely that even\r\nthen he had any intention of a serious reconciliation with Walpole.\r\nPerhaps he accepted this post in the expectation that he would shortly\r\nbe raised to a much higher position in the State.  But Walpole,\r\nalthough willing enough to give him any mark or place of honor on\r\ncondition that he withdrew to the House of Lords, was afraid to allow\r\nhim any office of influence while he remained in the Commons.  However\r\nthis may be, Pulteney's ambition was not satisfied, and he very soon\r\nbroke publicly away from Walpole altogether.  When a motion was brought\r\non in April, 1725, for discharging the debts of the Civil List, in\r\nreply to a message from the King himself, Pulteney demanded an inquiry\r\ninto the manner in which the money had been spent, and even made a\r\nfierce attack on the whole administration, and accused it of something\r\nvery like downright corruption.  He was dismissed from his office as\r\nCofferer, and, even making allowance for his love of money, the wonder\r\nis that he should have held it long enough to be dismissed from it.  He\r\nthen went avowedly over into the ranks of the enemies of Walpole inside\r\nand outside the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nThe position taken by Pulteney is chiefly interesting to us now in the\r\nfact that it opened a distinctly new chapter in English politics.\r\nPulteney created the part of what has ever since been called the Leader\r\nof Opposition.  {256} With him begins the time when the real Leader of\r\nOpposition must have a place in the House of Commons; with him, too,\r\nbegins the time when the Opposition has for its recognized duty not\r\nmerely to watch with jealous care all the acts of the ministers in\r\norder to prevent them from doing anything wrong, but also to watch for\r\nevery opportunity of turning them out of office.  With Pulteney and his\r\ntactics began the party organization which inside the House of Commons\r\nand outside works unceasingly with tongue and pen, with open antagonism\r\nand underhand intrigue, with all the various social as well as\r\npolitical influences--the pamphlet, the press, the petticoat, and even\r\nthe pulpit--to discredit everything done by the men in office, to turn\r\npublic opinion against them, and if possible to overthrow them.\r\nPulteney and his supporters were now and then somewhat more\r\nunscrupulous in their measures than an English Opposition would be in\r\nour time, but theirs was unquestionably the policy of all our more\r\nmodern English parties.  From this time forth almost to the close of\r\nhis active career as a politician Pulteney performed the part of Leader\r\nof Opposition in the strictly modern sense.  His position in history\r\nseems to us to be distinctly marked as that of the first Leader of\r\nOpposition; whether history shows reason to thank him for creating such\r\na part is another and a different question.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1725--Bolingbroke again]\r\n\r\nPulteney had some powerful allies.  The King, as we know, hated his\r\nson, the Prince of Wales; the Prince of Wales hated his father.  No\r\nreconciliation got up between them could be lasting or real.  The\r\nfather and son hardly ever met except on the occasion of some great\r\npublic ceremonial.  The standing quarrel between the Sovereign and his\r\nheir had the effect of creating two parties in political life, one of\r\nwhich supported the King and the King's advisers, while the other found\r\nits centre in the house of the Heir to the Throne.  We shall see this\r\ncondition of things re-appearing in all the subsequent reigns of the\r\nGeorges.  The ministry and their friends {257} were detested and\r\ndenounced by those who surrounded the Prince of Wales; the adherents of\r\nthe Prince of Wales were virtually proscribed by the King.  Then, as at\r\na later date in the history of the Georges, those who favored and were\r\nfavored by the Prince were looking out with anxious hope for the King's\r\ndeath.  When \"the old King is dead as nail in door,\" then indeed each\r\nleading supporter of the new king believed he could say with Falstaff,\r\n\"The laws of England are at my commandment; happy are they which have\r\nbeen my friends.\"  Pulteney and his supporters were among the friends\r\nand favorites of the Prince of Wales; they constituted the Prince's\r\nparty.  The Prince's party was composed mainly of the men who were\r\nTories but were not Jacobites, and of the Whigs who disliked Walpole or\r\nhad been overlooked or offended by him, or who in sober honesty were\r\nopposed to his policy.  In all these, and in a daily growing number of\r\nthe people out-of-doors, Pulteney had his friends and Walpole his\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nBut a more formidable rival than even Pulteney was now again to the\r\nfront and active in hostility to Walpole.  This was the man whom the\r\nofficial records of the time described as \"the late Viscount\r\nBolingbroke.\"  The late Viscount Bolingbroke, it need hardly be said,\r\nmeans that Henry St. John whose title of viscount had been forfeited\r\nwhen he fled to France and joined the Pretender.  Bolingbroke had\r\nlately received the pardon of King George.  He had secured the pardon\r\nchiefly by means of an influence then familiar and recognized in\r\npolitics--that of one of the King's mistresses.  Bolingbroke had got\r\nmoney with his second wife, and through her he conveyed to the Duchess\r\nof Kendal a large sum--about ten thousand pounds--with the intimation\r\nthat more would be forthcoming from the same place, if necessary, to\r\nobtain his object.  The Duchess of Kendal was easily prevailed upon,\r\nunder these circumstances, to recognize the justice of Bolingbroke's\r\nclaim and the sincerity of his repentance.  Moreover, there was about\r\nthe same time that {258} political intrigue, or rather rivalry of\r\nintrigues, going on between Walpole and Carteret, between England and\r\nFrance, in which it was thought the influence of Bolingbroke might be\r\nused with advantage--as it was, in fact, used--to Walpole's ends.\r\n[Sidenote: 1725--The Bolingbroke Petition] For all these reasons the\r\npardon was obtained, and Bolingbroke was allowed to return to England.\r\nNor was he long put off with a mere forgiveness which kept from him his\r\nforfeited estates and his right to the family inheritance.  \"Here I\r\nam,\" he wrote to Swift soon after, \"two-thirds restored, my person safe\r\n(unless I meet hereafter with harder treatment than even that of Sir\r\nWalter Raleigh), and my estate, with all the other property I have\r\nacquired or may acquire, secured to me.  But the attainder is kept\r\nprudently in force, lest so corrupt a member should come again into the\r\nHouse of Lords, and his bad leaven should sour that sweet, untainted\r\nmass.\"  Walpole was quite willing that the forfeiture of Lord\r\nBolingbroke's estates and the interruption of the inheritance should be\r\nrecalled.  It was necessary for this purpose to pass an Act of\r\nParliament.  On April 20, 1725, Lord Finch presented to the House of\r\nLords the petition \"of Henry St. John, late Viscount Bolingbroke.\"  The\r\npetition set forth that the petitioner was \"truly concerned for his\r\noffence in not having surrendered himself, pursuant to the directions\r\nof an act of the first year of his Majesty's reign;\" that he had\r\nlately, \"in most humble and dutiful manner,\" made his submission to the\r\nKing, and given his Majesty \"the strongest assurances of his inviolable\r\nfidelity, and of his zeal for his Majesty's service and for the support\r\nof the present happy establishment, which his Majesty hath been most\r\ngraciously pleased to accept.\"  The petition then prayed that leave\r\nmight be given to bring in a bill to enable the petitioner and his\r\nheirs male to take and enjoy in person the estates of which he was then\r\nor afterwards should be possessed.  Walpole, as Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, informed the House that he had received his Majesty's\r\ncommand to say that George was satisfied with Bolingbroke's {259}\r\npenitence, was convinced that Lord Bolingbroke was a proper object of\r\nmercy, and consented that the petition should be presented to the House.\r\n\r\nLord Finch then moved that a bill be brought in to carry out the prayer\r\nof the petition.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer seconded and strongly\r\nadvocated the motion.  It was opposed with great vigor by Mr. Methuen,\r\nthe Controller of the Household, and formerly British Minister in\r\nPortugal.  Methuen denounced Bolingbroke's \"scandalous and villainous\r\nconduct\" during his administration of affairs in Queen Anne's reign;\r\nhis clandestine negotiation for peace; his insolent behavior towards\r\nthe allies of England; his sacrificing the interests of the whole\r\nConfederacy and the honor of his country--more especially in the\r\nabandonment of the Catalans; \"and, to sum up all his crimes in one, his\r\ntraitorous designs of defeating the Protestant succession, and of\r\nadvancing a Popish pretender to the throne.\"  This speech, we read,\r\n\"made a great impression on the Assembly,\" and several distinguished\r\nmembers, Arthur Onslow among the rest, spoke strongly on the same side.\r\nThe motion, however, was carried by 231 votes against 113.  The Bill\r\nwas prepared, and went up to the House of Lords on May 5th, was carried\r\nthere by a large majority, was sent back to the House of Commons with\r\nsome slight amendments, was accepted there, and received the Royal\r\nassent.  Some of the peers put on record a strong and earnest protest\r\nagainst the passing of such a measure.  The protest recited all the\r\ncharges against Bolingbroke; declared that those who signed it knew of\r\nno particular public services which Bolingbroke had lately rendered,\r\nand which would entitle him to a generous treatment; and further added\r\nthat \"no assurances which this person hath given\" could be a sufficient\r\nsecurity against his future insincerity, \"he having already so often\r\nviolated the most solemn assurances and obligations, and in defiance of\r\nthem having openly attempted the dethroning his Majesty and the\r\ndestruction of the liberties of his country.\"\r\n\r\n{260}\r\n\r\nBolingbroke, however, wanted something more than restoration to his\r\ntitle and to his forfeited right of inheritance.  His active and\r\nuntamed spirit was eager for political strife again, and his heart\r\nburned with a longing to take his old place in the debates of the House\r\nof Lords.  Against this Walpole had made a firm resolve; on this point\r\nhe would not yield.  He would not allow his eloquent and daring rival\r\nto have a voice in Parliament any more.  In this, as it seems to us,\r\nWalpole acted neither wisely nor magnanimously.  Bolingbroke's safest\r\nplace, so far as the interests of the public, and even the political\r\ninterests of his rivals, were concerned, would have been in the House\r\nof Lords.  He would have delivered brilliant speeches there, and would\r\nhave worked off his energies in that harmless fashion.  In Walpole's\r\ntime, however, the idea had not yet arisen that an enemy to the settled\r\norder of things is least dangerous where he is most free to speak.\r\nBolingbroke, who had always hated Walpole, even lately when he was\r\nprofessing regard and gratitude, hated him now more than ever, and set\r\nto work by all the means in his power to injure Walpole in the\r\nestimation of the country, and, if possible, to undermine his whole\r\npolitical position.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1725-1726--The \"craftsman\"]\r\n\r\nBolingbroke and Pulteney soon came into political companionship.  There\r\nwas a certain affinity between the intellectual nature of the two men;\r\nand they had now a common object.  Both were literary men as well as\r\npoliticians, and they naturally put their literary gifts to the fullest\r\naccount in the campaign they had undertaken.  In our days two such men\r\ncombining for such a purpose would contrive to get incessant leading\r\narticles into some daily paper; perhaps would start a weekly or even a\r\ndaily evening paper of their own.  Bolingbroke and Pulteney were men in\r\nadvance of their age--in some respects at least.  They did between them\r\nstart a paper.  They established the famous _Craftsman_.  The\r\n_Craftsman_ was started in 1726.  It was first issued daily in single\r\nleaves or sheets after the fashion of the _Spectator_.  It was soon,\r\n{261} however, changed into a weekly newspaper bearing the title of the\r\n_Craftsman_ or _Country Journal_.  Its editor, Nicholas Amhurst, took\r\nthe feigned name of Caleb d'Anvers, and the paper itself was commonly\r\ncalled _Caleb_ accordingly.  The _Craftsman_ was brilliantly written,\r\nand was inspired by the most unscrupulous passion of partisan hate.\r\nWalpole was held up in prose and verse, in bold invective and droll\r\nlampoon, as a traitor to the country, as a man stuffed and gorged with\r\npublic plunder, audacious in his profligate disregard of political\r\nprinciple and common honesty, a danger to the State and a disgrace to\r\nparliamentary life.  The circulation of the _Craftsman_ at one time\r\nsurpassed that of the _Spectator_ at the height of the _Spectator's_\r\npopularity.  Not always are more flies caught by honey than by vinegar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{262}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\"OSNABRUCK!  OSNABRUCK!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1725--Trial of Lord Macclesfield]\r\n\r\nThe impeachment of Lord Macclesfield was ascribed, rightly or wrongly,\r\nto the influence of the Prince of Wales; the comparative leniency of\r\nLord Macclesfield's punishment to the favor and protection of the King.\r\nMacclesfield was a justly distinguished judge.  He had had the highest\r\nstanding at the bar; had risen, step by step, until from plain Thomas\r\nParker, the son of an attorney, he became Chief Justice of the Court of\r\nKing's Bench, then one of the Lords Justices of the kingdom in the\r\ninterval between Anne's death and the arrival of George the First, and\r\nfinally Lord Chancellor.  George made him Baron, and subsequently Earl,\r\nof Macclesfield.  He had always borne a high reputation for probity as\r\nwell as for generosity until the charge was made against him on which\r\nhe was impeached.  He was accused of having, while Lord Chancellor,\r\nsold the offices of Masters in Chancery to incompetent persons and men\r\nof straw, unfit to be intrusted with the money of suitors, but whom he\r\nhad publicly represented to be \"persons of great fortunes, and in every\r\nrespect qualified for that trust;\" with having extorted money from\r\nseveral of the masters, and with having embezzled the estates of widows\r\nand orphans.  On May 6, 1725, the managers of the House of Commons\r\nappeared at the bar of the House of Lords and presented their articles\r\nof impeachment against Macclesfield.  The trial took place at the bar\r\nof the House, and not in Westminster Hall, where impeachments were\r\nusually carried on, and it lasted until May 26th.  There was nothing\r\nthat could be called a defence to some of the charges, and as {263} to\r\nothers Lord Macclesfield simply insisted that he had followed the\r\nexample of some of his most illustrious predecessors, and that the\r\nmoneys he received as presents were reckoned among the known\r\nperquisites of the Great Seal, and were not declared unlawful by any\r\nAct of Parliament.  The Lords were unanimous in finding Macclesfield\r\nguilty, and condemned him to be fined thirty thousand pounds, and to be\r\nimprisoned in the Tower until the fine had been paid.  The motion that\r\nhe be declared forever incapable of any office, place, or employment in\r\nthe State was, however, rejected, as was also a motion to prohibit him\r\nfrom ever sitting in Parliament or coming within the verge of the\r\ncourt.  It would certainly seem as if these motions ought to have been\r\nthe natural and necessary consequence of the impeachment and the\r\nconviction.  If the conviction were just--and it was obviously\r\njust--then Lord Macclesfield had disgraced the highest bench of\r\njustice, and merely to condemn him to disgorge a part of his plunder\r\nwas a singularly inadequate sort of punishment.  George the First,\r\nhowever, chose to ascribe the impeachment to the malice and the\r\ninfluence of the Prince of Wales, and when Macclesfield had paid the\r\nfine by the mortgage of an estate, the King undertook to repay the\r\nmoney to him.  George actually did pay to Macclesfield one instalment\r\nof a thousand pounds, but fate interposed and prevented any further\r\npayment.  Macclesfield retired from the world, and spent his remaining\r\nyears in the study of science and in religious meditation.  He died in\r\n1732.  His was a strange story.  He had many of the noblest qualities;\r\nhe had had, on the whole, a great career.  It is not easy, if we may\r\nborrow the words which Burke applied to a more picturesque and\r\ninteresting sufferer, \"to contemplate without emotion that elevation\r\nand that fall.\"\r\n\r\nDuring all this time of comparative quietude we are not to suppose that\r\nthere were no threatenings of foreign disturbance.  The adherents of\r\nthe Stuarts were never at rest; the controversies which grew out of the\r\nTreaty of Utrecht were always sputtering and menacing.  Cardinal {264}\r\nFleury, a statesman devoted to peace and economy, had become\r\nPrime-minister of France.  Other new figures were arising on the field\r\nof Continental politics.  Alberoni, in exile and disgrace, had been\r\nsucceeded by a burlesque imitation of him, the Duke of Ripperda, a\r\nDutch adventurer who turned diplomatist, and had risen into influence\r\nthrough Alberoni's favor.  In 1725 Ripperda negotiated a secret treaty\r\nbetween the Emperor, Charles the Sixth, and the King of Spain, and was\r\nrewarded with the title of duke.  He became Prime-minister of Spain for\r\na short time, to be presently disgraced and thrown into prison, quite\r\nafter the fashion of a royal favorite in the pages of \"Gil Blas.\"  He\r\nwas a fantastic, arrogant, feather-headed creature, an Alberoni of the\r\n_opera bouffe_.  He betook himself at last to the service of the\r\nSovereign of Morocco.  England had a sort of Ripperda of her own in the\r\nperson of the wild Duke of Wharton, the man whose eloquent and\r\nferocious invective had contributed to the sudden death of Lord\r\nStanhope, and who had since that time devoted himself to the service of\r\nJames Stuart on the Continent, and actually fought as a volunteer in\r\nthe ranks of the Spanish army at the abortive siege of Gibraltar.  It\r\nis to the credit of the sincerer and better supporters of the Stuart\r\ncause that they would not even still consent to regard it as wholly\r\nlost.  They kept their eyes fixed on England, and every murmur of\r\nnational discontent or disturbance became to them a new encouragement,\r\na fresh signal of hope, a reviving incitement to energy.  In England\r\nmen were constantly hearing rumors about the dissolute life of the\r\nChevalier, and his quarrels with his wife, Clementina Maria, a\r\ngranddaughter of one of the Kings of Poland.  The loyalists here at\r\nhome were ready to believe anything that could be said by anybody to\r\nthe discredit of James and his adherents; James and his adherents were\r\nwilling to be fed on any tales about the unpopularity of George the\r\nFirst, and the tottering condition of his throne.  Nor could it be said\r\nthat George was popular with any class of persons in {265} England.  If\r\nthe reign of the Brunswicks depended upon personal popularity, it would\r\nnot have endured for many years.  But the people of England were able\r\nto see clearly enough that George allowed his great minister to rule\r\nfor him, and that Walpole's policy meant prosperity and peace.  They\r\ndid not admire George's mistresses any more now than they had done when\r\nfirst these ladies set their large feet on English soil; but even some\r\nof the most devoted followers of the Stuart cause shook their heads\r\nsadly over the doings of James in Italy, and could not pretend to say\r\nthat the cause of morality would gain much by a change from Brunswick\r\nto Stuart.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1727--Death of George the First]\r\n\r\nThe end was very near for George.  He was now an old man, in his\r\nsixty-eighth year, and he had not led a life to secure a long lease of\r\nhealth.  His excesses in eating and drinking, his hot punch, and his\r\nmany mistresses had proved too much even for his originally robust\r\nconstitution.  Of late he had become a mere wreck.  He was eager to pay\r\none other visit to Hanover, and he embarked at Greenwich on June 3,\r\n1727, landing in Holland on the 7th of the month.  He made for his\r\ncapital as quickly as he could, but in the course of the journey he was\r\nattacked by a sort of lethargic paralysis.  Early on June 10th he was\r\nseized with an apoplectic fit; his hands hung motionless by his sides,\r\nhis eyes were fixed, glassy, and staring, and his tongue protruded from\r\nhis mouth.  The sight of him horrified his attendants; they wished to\r\nstop at once and secure some assistance for the poor old dying King.\r\nGeorge, however, recovered consciousness so far as to be able to insist\r\non pursuing his journey, crying out, with spasmodic efforts at command,\r\nthe words \"Osnabrück!  Osnabrück!\"  At Osnabrück lived his brother the\r\nPrince-bishop.  The attendants dared not disobey George, even at that\r\nmoment, and the carriage drove at its fullest speed on towards\r\nOsnabrück.  No swiftness of wheels, however, no flying chariot, could\r\nhave reached the house of the Prince-bishop in time for the King.  When\r\nthe royal carriages clattered into the court-yard of the {266}\r\nPrince-bishop's palace the reign of the first George was over--the old\r\nKing lay dead in his seat.  Lord Townshend and the Duchess of Kendal\r\nwere following in different carriages on the road; an express was sent\r\nback to tell them the grim news.  Lord Townshend came on to Osnabrück,\r\nand finding that the King was dead, had nothing to do but to return\r\nhome at once.  The Duchess of Kendal is stated to have shown all the\r\nsigns of grief proper to be expected from a favorite.  She tore her\r\nhair--at least she pulled and clutched at it--and she beat her ample\r\nbosom, and professed the uttermost horror at the thought of having to\r\nendure life without the companionship of her lord and master.  It is\r\nsatisfactory, however, to know that she did not die of grief.  She\r\nlived for some sixteen years, and made her home for the most part at\r\nKendal House, near Twickenham.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1727--The raven]\r\n\r\nEven such a man as George the First may become invested by death with a\r\ncertain dignity and something of a romantic interest.  Legends are\r\nafloat concerning the King's later days which would not be altogether\r\nunworthy the closing hours of a great Roman emperor.  George had his\r\nmelting moments, it would seem, and not long before his death, being in\r\na pathetic mood, he gave the Duchess of Kendal a pledge that if he\r\nshould die before her, and it were possible for departed souls to\r\nreturn to earth and impress the living with a knowledge of their\r\npresence, he, the faithful and aged lover, would come back from the\r\ngrave to his mistress.  When the Duchess of Kendal returned to her home\r\nnear Twickenham she was in constant expectation of a visit in some form\r\nfrom her lost adorer.  One day while the windows of her house were\r\nopen, a large black raven, or bird of some kind--raven would seem to be\r\nthe more becoming and appropriate form for such a visitor--flew into\r\nher presence from the outer air.  The lamenting lady assumed at once\r\nthat in this shape the soul of King George had come back to earth.  She\r\ncherished and petted the bird, it is said, and lavished all fondness\r\nand tenderness upon it.  What {267} became of it in the end history\r\ndoes not allow us to know.  Whether it still is sitting, like the more\r\nfamous raven of poetry, it is not for us to guess.  Probably when the\r\nDuchess herself expired in 1743, the ghastly, grim, and ancient raven\r\ndisappeared with her.  Why George the First, if he had the power of\r\nreturning in any shape to see his mistress, did not come in his own\r\nproper form, it is not for us to explain.  One might be disposed to\r\nimagine that in such a case it would be the first step which would\r\ninvolve the cost, and that there would be no greater difficulty for the\r\ndeparted soul to come back in the likeness of its old vestment of clay\r\nthan to put on the unfamiliar and somewhat inconvenient form of a fowl.\r\nPerhaps the story is not true.  Possibly there was no raven or other\r\nbird in the case at all.  It may be that, if a black raven did fly in\r\nat the Duchess of Kendal's window, the bird was not the embodied spirit\r\nof King George.  For ourselves, we should be sorry to lose the story.\r\nNeither the King nor the mistress could afford to part with any slight\r\nclement of romance wherewithal even legend has chosen to invest them.\r\nAnother story, which probably has more truth in it, adds a new\r\nghastliness to the circumstances of George's death.  On November 13,\r\n1726, some seven months before that event, there died in a German\r\ncastle a woman whom the gazette of the capital described as the\r\nElectress Dowager of Hanover.  This was the unfortunate Princess\r\nSophia, the wife of George.  Thirty-two years of melancholy captivity\r\nshe had endured, while George was drinking and hoarding money and\r\namusing himself with his seraglio of ugly women.  She died protesting\r\nher innocence to the last.  In the closing days of her illness, so runs\r\nthe story, she gave into the hands of some one whom she could trust, a\r\nletter addressed to her husband, and obtained a promise that the letter\r\nshould, somehow or other, be delivered to George himself.  This letter\r\ncontained a final declaration that she was absolutely guiltless of the\r\noffence alleged against her, a bitter reproach to George for his\r\nruthless conduct, {268} and a solemn summons to him to stand by her\r\nside before the judgment-seat of Heaven within a year, and there make\r\nanswer in her presence for the wrongs he had done her, for her blighted\r\nlife and her miserable death.  There was no way of getting this letter\r\ninto George's hands while the King was in England, but an arrangement\r\nwas made by means of which it was put into his coach when he crossed\r\nthe frontier of Germany on his way towards his capital.  George, it is\r\nsaid, opened the letter at once, and was so surprised and\r\nhorror-stricken by its stern summons that he fell that moment into the\r\napoplectic fit from which he never recovered.  Sophia, therefore, had\r\nherself accomplished her own revenge; her reproach had killed the King;\r\nher summons brought him at once within the ban of that judgment to\r\nwhich she had called him.  It would be well if one could believe the\r\nstory; there would seem a dramatic justice--a tragic retribution--about\r\nit.  Its very terror would dignify the story of a life that, on the\r\nwhole, was commonplace and vulgar.  But, for ourselves, we confess that\r\nwe cannot believe in the mysterious letter, the fatal summons, the\r\nsudden fulfilment.  There are too many stories of the kind floating\r\nabout history to allow us to attach any special significance to this\r\nparticular tale.  We doubt even whether, if the letter had been\r\nwritten, it would have greatly impressed the mind of George.  Remorse\r\nfor the treatment of his wife he could not have felt--he was incapable\r\nof any such emotion; and we question whether any appeal to the\r\nsentiment of the supernatural, any summons to another and an impalpable\r\nworld, would have made much impression on that stolid, prosaic\r\nintelligence and that heart of lead.  Besides, according to some\r\nversions of the tale, it was not, after all, a letter from his wife\r\nwhich impressed him, but only the warning of a fortune-teller--a woman\r\nwho admonished the King to be careful of the life of his imprisoned\r\nconsort, because it was fated for him that he should not survive her a\r\nyear.  This story, too, is told of many kings and other persons less\r\nillustrious.\r\n\r\n{269}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1727--Character of the first George]\r\n\r\nMuch more probable is the rumor that Sophia made a will bequeathing all\r\nher personal property to her son, that the will was given to George the\r\nFirst in England, and that he composedly destroyed it.  If George\r\ncommitted this act, he seems to have been repaid in kind.  His own will\r\nleft large legacies to the Duchess of Kendal and to other ladies.  The\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury gave the will to the new King, who read it,\r\nput it in his pocket, walked away with it, and never produced it again.\r\nBoth these stories are doubted by some of the contemporaries of George\r\nthe Second, but they were firmly believed in and strongly asserted by\r\nothers, who seem to have had authority for their belief.  At all\r\nevents, they fit in better with the character and surroundings of both\r\nprinces than the tragic story of the letter and its fearful summons,\r\nthe warning of the fortune-teller, or the soul of the dead King\r\nrevisiting the earth in the funereal form of a raven.\r\n\r\nThere is not much that is good to be said of George the First.  He had\r\na certain prosaic honesty, and was frugal amid all his vulgar\r\nvoluptuousness.  He managed the expenses of his court with creditable\r\neconomy and regularity.  The officers in his army, and his civil\r\nservants, received their pay at the properly-appointed time.  It would\r\nbe hardly worth while recording these particulars to the King's credit,\r\nbut that it was somewhat of a novelty in the arrangements of a modern\r\ncourt for men to receive the reward of their services at regular\r\nintervals and in the proper amount.  George occasionally did a liberal\r\nthing, and he more than once professed a strong interest in the\r\nimprovement of university education.  He is said to have declared to a\r\nGerman nobleman, who was complimenting him on the possession of two\r\nsuch kingdoms as England and Hanover, that a king ought to be\r\ncongratulated rather on having two such subjects as Newton in the one\r\ncountry and Leibnitz in the other.  We fear, however, that this story\r\nmust go with the fortune-teller and the raven; one cannot think of dull\r\nprosaic {270} George uttering such a monumental sort of sentiment.  He\r\ncared nothing for literature or science or art.  He seems to have had\r\nno genuine friendships.  He hated his son, and he used to speak of his\r\ndaughter-in-law, Caroline, as \"that she-devil the princess.\" [Sidenote:\r\n1727--His epitaph] Whatever was respectable in his character came out\r\nbest at times of trial.  He was not a man whom danger could make\r\nafraid.  At the most critical moments--as, for instance, at the\r\noutbreak of the rebellion in 1715--he never lost his head.  If he was\r\nnot capable of seeing far, he saw clearly, and he could look coming\r\nevents steadily in the face.  On one or two occasions, when an\r\nimportant choice had to be made between this political course and that,\r\nhe chose quickly and well.  The fact that he thoroughly appreciated the\r\nwisdom and the political integrity, of Walpole speaks, perhaps, his\r\nhighest praise.  His reign, on the whole, was one of prosperity for\r\nEngland.  He did not love England--never, up to the very end, cared for\r\nthe country over which destiny had appointed him to rule.  His soul to\r\nthe last was faithful to Hanover.  England was to him as the State wife\r\nwhom for political reasons he was compelled to marry; Hanover, as the\r\nsweetheart and mistress of his youth, to whom his affections, such as\r\nthey were, always clung, and whom he stole out to see at every possible\r\nchance.  George behaved much better to his political consort, England,\r\nthan to the veritable wife of his bosom.  He managed England's affairs\r\nfor her like an honest, straightforward, narrow-minded steward.  We\r\nshall see hereafter that England came to be governed much worse by men\r\nnot nearly so bad as George the First.  To do him justice, he knew when\r\nhe ought to leave the business of the State in the hands of those who\r\nunderstood it better than he; this one merit redeemed many of his\r\nfaults, and, perhaps, may be regarded as having secured his dynasty.\r\nFrederick the Great described George as a prince who governed England\r\nby respecting liberty, even while he made use of the subsidies granted\r\nby Parliament to corrupt the Parliament which voted them.  {271} He was\r\na king, Frederick declares, \"without ostentation and without deceit,\"\r\nand who won by his conduct the confidence of Europe.  This latter part\r\nof the description is a little too polite.  Kings do not criticise each\r\nother too keenly in works that are meant for publication.  But the\r\nwords form, on the whole, an epitaph for George which might be\r\ninscribed on his tomb without greater straining of the truth than is\r\ncommon in the monumental inscriptions that adorn the graves of less\r\nexalted persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{272}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nGEORGE THE SECOND.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1727--Death of Newton]\r\n\r\nThe year when George the First died was made memorable forever by the\r\ndeath of a far greater man than any European king of that generation.\r\nWhen describing the events which led to the publication of the \"Drapier's\r\nLetters,\" we mentioned the fact that Sir Isaac Newton had been consulted\r\nabout the coinage of Wood's half-pence.  That was the last time that\r\nIsaac Newton appeared as a living figure in public controversy of any\r\nkind.  On March 20, 1727, the great philosopher died, after much\r\nsuffering, at his house in Kensington.  The epitaph which Pope intended\r\nfor him sums up as well as a long discourse could do his achievements in\r\nscience--\r\n\r\n  \"Nature and Nature's laws lay hid in night;\r\n  God said, 'Let Newton be,' and all was light.\"\r\n\r\nNo other discovery ever made in science approaches in importance to the\r\ndiscovery of the principle of universal gravitation--the principle that\r\nevery particle of matter is attracted by every other particle with a\r\nforce proportioned inversely to the square of their distances.  Vague\r\nideas of some such principle had long been floating in the minds of some\r\nmen; had probably been thus floating since ever men began to think\r\nseriously over the phenomena of inanimate nature.  But the discovery of\r\nthe principle was, however, as distinctly the achievement of Newton as\r\n\"Paradise Lost\" is the work of Milton.  We find it hard now to form to\r\nourselves any clear idea of a world to which Newton's principle was\r\nunknown.  It would be almost as easy to realize the idea of a world\r\nwithout {273} light or atmosphere.  Newton is called by Sir David\r\nBrewster the greatest philosopher of any age.  Sir John Herschel assigns\r\nto the name of Newton \"a place in our veneration which belongs to no\r\nother in the annals of science.\"  In this book we have only to record the\r\ndate at which the pure and simple life of this great man came to its end.\r\nThe important events of his career belong to an earlier period; his\r\nteachings and his fame are for all time.  The humblest of historians as\r\nwell as the greatest may ask himself what is the principle of history\r\nwhich bids us to assign so much more space to the wars of kings and the\r\ncontroversies of statesmen than to the life and the deeds of a man like\r\nNewton.  In the whole history of the world during Newton's lifetime, the\r\none most important fact, the one fact of which the magnitude dwarfs all\r\nother facts, is the discovery of the principle of gravitation.  Yet its\r\nmeaning may be explained in fewer words than would be needed to describe\r\nthe nature of the antagonism between Walpole and Pulteney, or the reason\r\nwhy Queen Anne was succeeded by King George.\r\n\r\nWe have, however, in these pages only to deal with history in its old\r\nand, we suppose, its everlasting fashion--that of telling what happened\r\nin the way of actual fact, telling the story of the time.  The English\r\npublic took the death of George the First with becoming composure; the\r\nvast majority of the people never troubled their heads about it.  It gave\r\na flutter of hope to Spain; it set the councils of the Stuart party in\r\neager commotion for a while; but it made no change in England.  \"George\r\nthe First was always reckoned Vile; still viler George the Second.\"\r\nThese are the lines in which Walter Savage Landor sums up the character\r\nof the first and second George before passing on to picture in little the\r\ncharacters of the third and fourth of the name.  Landor was not wrong\r\nwhen he described George the Second as, on the whole, rather worse than\r\nGeorge the First.  George the Second was born at Hanover on October {274}\r\n30, 1683, and was therefore in his forty-fourth year when he succeeded to\r\nthe throne.  He had still less natural capacity than his father.  He was\r\nparsimonious; he was avaricious; he was easily put out of temper.  His\r\ninstincts, feelings, passions were all purely selfish.  He had hot\r\nhatreds and but cool friendships.  Personal courage was, perhaps, the\r\nonly quality becoming a sovereign which George the Second possessed.  He\r\nhad served as a volunteer under Marlborough in 1708, and at the battle of\r\nOudenarde he had headed a charge of his Hanoverian dragoons with a\r\nbravery worthy of a prince.  He is to serve later on at Dettingen, and to\r\nbe in all probability the last English sovereign who commanded in person\r\non the battlefield.  His education was not even so good as that of his\r\nfather, and he had an utter contempt for literature.  He had little\r\nreligious feeling, but is said to have had a firm belief in the existence\r\nof vampires.  He was fond of business--devoted to the small ways of\r\nroutine.  He took a great interest in military matters and all that\r\nconcerned the arrangements and affairs of an army.  Like his father he\r\nfound abiding pleasure in the society of a little group of more or less\r\nattractive mistresses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1727--Incredulity of the Prince of Wales]\r\n\r\nGeorge the Second had always detested his father, and during the greater\r\npart of their lives was equally detested by him.  The reconciliation\r\nwhich had lately taken place between them was as formal and superficial\r\nas that of the two demons described in Le Sage's story.  \"They brought us\r\ntogether,\" says Asmodeus; \"they reconciled us.  We shook hands and became\r\nmortal enemies.\"  When the reconciliation between George the Second and\r\nhis father was brought about by the influence of Stanhope and of Walpole,\r\nthe father and son shook hands and continued to be mortal enemies.  If\r\nGeorge the First had his court at St. James's, George the Second had his\r\ncourt and _coterie_ gathered around him at Leicester Fields and at\r\nRichmond.  The two courts were, in fact, little better than hostile\r\ncamps.  Walpole had been for long years the confidential and favored\r\nservant of George the First.  The {275} natural expectation was that he\r\nwould be instantly discredited and discarded when George the Second came\r\nto the throne.\r\n\r\nSo, indeed, it seemed at first to happen.  When Walpole received the news\r\nof George the First's death he hastened to Richmond Lodge, where George\r\nthe Second then was, in order to give him the news and hail him as King.\r\nGeorge was in bed, and had to be roused from a thick sleep.  He was angry\r\nat being disturbed, and not in a humor to admit that there was any excuse\r\nfor disturbing him.  When Walpole told him that his father was dead, the\r\nkingly answer of the sovereign was that the statesman's assertion was a\r\nbig lie.  George roared this at Walpole, and then was for turning round\r\nin his bed and settling down to sleep again.  Walpole, however, persisted\r\nin disturbing the royal slumbers, and assured the drowsy grumbler that he\r\nreally was George the Second, King of England.  He produced for George's\r\nfurther satisfaction a letter from Lord Townshend, describing the time,\r\nplace, and circumstances of the late King's death.  Walpole tendered the\r\nusual ceremonial expressions of loyalty, which George received coldly,\r\nand even gruffly.  Then the minister asked whom his Majesty wished to\r\nappoint to draw up the necessary declaration for the Privy Council.\r\nWalpole assumed as a matter of course that the King would leave the task\r\nin his hands.  George, however, disappointed him.  \"Compton,\" said the\r\nKing; and when he had spoken that word he intimated to Walpole that the\r\ninterview was over.  Walpole left the royal abode believing himself a\r\nfallen man.\r\n\r\n\"Compton,\" whom the King had thus curtly designated, was Sir Spencer\r\nCompton, who had been chosen Speaker of the House of Commons in 1715.  He\r\nhad been one of George the Second's favorites while George was still\r\nPrince of Wales.  He was a man of respectable character, publicly and\r\nprivately, but without remarkable capacity of any kind.  He knew little\r\nor nothing of the business of a minister, and it is said that when\r\nWalpole {276} came to him to tell him of the King's command he frankly\r\nacknowledged that he did not know how to draw up the formal declaration.\r\nWalpole good-naturedly came to his assistance, took his pen, and did the\r\nwork for him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1727--Compton's evaporation]\r\n\r\nIf the King had persevered in his objection to Walpole, the story of the\r\nreign would have to be very differently told.  Walpole was the one only\r\nman who could at the time have firmly stood between England and foreign\r\nintrigue--between England and financial blunder.  Nor is it unlikely that\r\nthe King would have persevered and refused to admit Walpole to office but\r\nthat he happened to be, without his own knowledge, under the influence of\r\nthe one only woman who had any legitimate right to influence him--his\r\nwife Caroline.  Caroline, daughter of a petty German prince--the Margrave\r\nof Brandenburg-Anspach--was one of the most remarkable women of her time.\r\nHer faults, foibles, and weaknesses only served to make her more\r\nremarkable.  She had beauty when she was young, and she still had an\r\nexpressive face and a sweet smile.  She was well educated, and always\r\ncontinued to educate herself; she was fond of letters, art, politics, and\r\nmetaphysics.  She delighted in theological controversy, and also\r\ndelighted in contests of mere wit.  But of all her valuable gifts, the\r\nmost valuable for herself and for the country was the capacity she had\r\nfor governing her husband.  She governed him through his very anxiety not\r\nto be governed by his wife.  One of George's strongest, and at the same\r\ntime meanest, desires was to let the world see that he was absolute\r\nmaster in his own house, and could rule his wife with a rod of iron.\r\nCaroline, having long since discovered this weakness, played into the\r\nKing's hands, and always made outward show of the utmost deference for\r\nhis authority, and dread of his anger.  She put herself metaphorically,\r\nand indeed almost literally, under his feet.  She was pleased that all\r\nthe Court should see her thus grovelling.  George was in the habit of\r\nmaking jocular allusion, in his jovial, graceful way, to living and dead\r\nsovereigns who were {277} governed by their wives, and he often invited\r\nhis courtiers to notice the difference between them and him, and to\r\nadmire the imperial supremacy which he exercised over the humble\r\nCaroline.  By humoring him in this way Caroline obtained, without any\r\nconsciousness on his part, an almost absolute power over him.  Another\r\nand a worse failing of the King's she humored as well.  She had suffered\r\nmuch in the beginning of her married life because of his amours and his\r\nmistresses.  Her true and faithful heart had been wrung by long\r\njealousies; but, happily for herself and for the country, she was able at\r\nlast to rise superior to this natural weakness of woman.  Indeed, it has\r\nto be said with regret for her self-degradation, that she not only\r\ntolerated the love-makings of the King and his favorites, but even showed\r\noccasionally a politic interest in the promotion of the amours and the\r\nappointment of the ladies.  She humored her lord and master's avarice\r\nwith as little scruple.  Thus his principal defects--his sordid love of\r\nmoney, his ignoble passion for women, and his ridiculous desire to seem\r\nthe absolute master of his wife--became in her skilful hands the\r\nleading-strings by which she drew and guided him whither she would have\r\nhim go.  Through Caroline's influence mainly Walpole was retained in\r\npower.  She played on the King's avarice, and poured into his greedy ear\r\nthe assurance that Walpole could raise money as no other living man\r\ncould.  Caroline acted in this chiefly from a sincere love of her\r\nhusband, and anxiety for his good, but partly also, it has to be\r\nacknowledged, because it had been made known to her that Walpole would\r\nprovide her with a larger allowance than it was Compton's intention to\r\ndo.  The result was that Walpole was retained in office, or, perhaps it\r\nshould be said, restored to office.  The crowds of courtiers who love to\r\nworship the rising sun had hardly time to offer their adoration to\r\nCompton when they found that the supposed rising sun was only a meteor,\r\nwhich instantly vanished.  Horace Walpole the younger describes the event\r\nby a happy phrase as \"Compton's evaporation.\"  Compton {278} himself had\r\nsoon found that the responsibility would be too much for him.  He\r\nbesought the King to relieve him of the burden to which he found himself\r\nunequal.  The King acceded to his wish.  Walpole became once again First\r\nLord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Townshend\r\ncontinued to be Secretary of State.  The crisis was over.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1727--Condolence and congratulation]\r\n\r\nParliament assembled on June 15th, after the death of George the First.\r\nAs the law then stood, any Parliament summoned by a sovereign was not to\r\nbe dissolved by that sovereign's death, but should continue to sit and\r\nact during a term of six months, \"unless the same shall be sooner\r\nprorogued or dissolved by such person who shall be next heir to the Crown\r\nof this Realm in succession.\"  The meeting of June 15th was merely\r\nformal.  Parliament was prorogued by a Commission from George the Second\r\nuntil the 27th of the month.  Both Houses then met at Westminster, and\r\nthe King came to the House of Peers in his royal robes and ascended the\r\nthrone with all the regular ceremonial.  Sir Charles Dalton, Gentleman\r\nUsher of the Black Rod, was sent with a message from the King commanding\r\nthe attendance of the Commons.  When the Commons had crowded into the\r\nspace appointed for them in the Peers' Chamber, the King \"delivered from\r\nhis own mouth\" the Royal speech.  George the Second had at all events one\r\nadvantage over George the First as a King of England--he understood the\r\nlanguage of his subjects, and could speak to them in their own tongue.\r\nThe Royal speech began by expressing the King's persuasion that \"you all\r\nshare with me in my grief and affliction for the death of my late royal\r\nfather.\"  The King was well warranted in this persuasion; nothing could\r\nbe more correct than his assumption.  The Lords and Commons quite shared\r\nwith him his grief and affliction for the death of his royal father.\r\nThey felt just as much distress at that event as he did.  The King then\r\nwent on to declare his fixed resolution to merit by all possible means\r\nthe love and affection of his people; to preserve the Constitution {279}\r\n\"as it is now happily established in Church and State;\" and to secure to\r\nall his subjects the full enjoyment of their religious and civil rights.\r\nHe expressed his satisfaction at the manner in which tranquillity and the\r\nbalance of power in Europe had been maintained, the strict union and\r\nharmony which had hitherto subsisted among the allies of the Treaty of\r\nHanover, and which had chiefly contributed to the near prospect of a\r\ngeneral peace.  Finally, the King pointed out that the grant of the\r\ngreatest part of his Civil List revenues had now run out, and that it\r\nwould be necessary for the House of Commons to make a new provision for\r\nthe support of him and of his family.  \"I am persuaded,\" said the King,\r\n\"that the experience of past times and a due regard to the honor and\r\ndignity of the Crown will prevail upon you to give me this first proof of\r\nyour zeal and affection in a manner answerable to the necessities of my\r\nGovernment.\"  Then the King withdrew, and Lord Chesterfield moved for \"an\r\naddress of condolence, congratulation, and thanks.\"  The condoling and\r\ncongratulating address was unanimously voted, was presented next day to\r\nhis Majesty, and received his Majesty's most gracious acknowledgment.\r\nMeanwhile the Commons having returned to their House, several new members\r\ntook the oaths.  Sir Paul Methuen, Treasurer of the Household, the author\r\nof the commercial treaty with Portugal which still bears his name, moved\r\nan address of condolence and congratulation to the King.  The motion was\r\nseconded by Sir Robert Walpole, and as the formal record puts it, \"voted\r\n_nemine contradicente_.\"  A committee was appointed to draw up the\r\naddress, Sir Robert Walpole, of course, being one of its members.  The\r\nchairman of the committee paid Walpole the compliment of handing him the\r\npen, \"whereupon,\" as a contemporary account reports it, \"Sir Robert,\r\nwithout hesitation and with a masterly hand, drew up the said address.\"\r\nWalpole could be courtly enough when he thought fit.  He seems to have\r\ndistinctly outdone the House of Lords in the fervor of his grief for the\r\nlate King and his devotion {280} to the present.  The death of George the\r\nFirst, Walpole pronounced to be \"a loss to this nation which your Majesty\r\nalone could possibly repair.\" Having mentioned the fact that the death of\r\nGeorge the First had plunged all England into grief, Walpole changed, \"as\r\nby the stroke of an enchanter's wand,\" this winter of our discontent into\r\nglorious summer.  \"Your immediate succession,\" he assured the King,\r\n\"banished all our grief.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1727--\"Honest Shippen\"]\r\n\r\nOn Monday, July 3d, the Commons met to consider the amount of supply to\r\nbe granted to his Majesty.  Walpole, as Chancellor of the Exchequer,\r\nstated to the House that the annual sum of seven hundred thousand pounds,\r\ngranted to the late King \"for the support of his household and of the\r\nhonor and dignity of the Crown,\" had fallen short every year, and that\r\nministers had been obliged to make it up in other ways.  The present\r\nsovereign's necessary expenses were likely to increase, the Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer explained, \"by reason of the largeness of his family\" and\r\nthe necessity of \"settling a household for his royal consort.\"  The\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer therefore moved that the entire revenues of\r\nthe Civil List, which produced about one hundred and thirty thousand\r\npounds a year above the yearly sum of seven hundred thousand pounds\r\nalready mentioned, should be settled on his Majesty during life.  The\r\nmotion was supported by several members, but Mr. Shippen, the earnest and\r\nable, though somewhat eccentric, Jacobite and Tory, had the spirit and\r\ncourage to oppose it.  Shippen's speech was expressed in a spirit of\r\nloyalty, but was direct and incisive in its criticism of the Government\r\nproposal.  Shippen pointed out that the yearly sum of seven hundred\r\nthousand pounds, now thought too little, was not obtained by the late\r\nsovereign without a long and solemn debate, and was described by every\r\none who contended for it as an ample revenue for a king.  He reminded the\r\nHouse that Queen Anne used to pay about nineteen thousand pounds a year\r\nout of her own pocket for the augmentation of the salaries of poor\r\nclergymen, {281} allowed five thousand pounds a year out of the\r\nPost-office revenue to the Duke of Marlborough, gave several hundred\r\nthousand pounds for the building of the castle of Blenheim; and by this\r\nmeans came under the necessity of asking Parliament for five hundred\r\nthousand pounds, which she determined never to do again, and had\r\ntherefore prepared a scheme for the reduction of her expenses, which was\r\nto bring her full yearly outlay down to four hundred and fifty thousand\r\npounds.  Shippen then severely criticised the foreign policy of the late\r\nKing's reign, and with justice condemned the extravagance which required\r\nto be met by repeated grants from the nation.  \"I confess,\" he said,\r\n\"that if the same management was to be continued, and if the same\r\nministers were to be again employed, a million a year would not be\r\nsufficient to carry on the exorbitant expenses so often and so justly\r\ncomplained of in this House.\"  He deplored the vast sum \"sunk in the\r\nbottomless gulf of secret service.\"  \"I heartily wish,\" he exclaimed,\r\n\"that time, the great discoverer of hidden truths and concealed\r\niniquities, may produce a list of all such--if any such there were--who\r\nhave been perverted from their public duty by private pensions, who have\r\nbeen the hired slaves and the corrupt instruments of a profuse and\r\nvainglorious administration.\"  Shippen concluded by moving as an\r\namendment that the amount granted to his Majesty be the clear yearly sum\r\nof seven hundred thousand pounds.  It is worth noticing that when Shippen\r\nhad occasion once to refer to some of Walpole's arguments he spoke of him\r\nas \"my honorable friend,\" and then, suddenly correcting himself, said, \"I\r\nask pardon; I should have said the honorable person, for there is no\r\nfriendship betwixt us.\"\r\n\r\nShippen's speech hit hard, and must have been felt by the ministry.  The\r\none charge against Walpole's government which he could not refute was the\r\ncharge of extravagance in corruption.  The ministers, however, affected\r\nto treat the speech with contempt, and were justified in doing so by the\r\nmanner in which the House of Commons {282} dealt with it.  No answer was\r\ngiven to Shippen's statements, because Shippen's motion was not seconded\r\nand fell to the ground.  The resolutions proposed by the Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer were carried without a division, and a bill was ordered to\r\nbe brought in to give effect to them.  A provision of one hundred\r\nthousand pounds a year was voted for the Queen, in case she should\r\nsurvive the King.  The vote was agreed to without division or debate.\r\nParliament was dissolved by proclamation on August 7th.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1728--Onslow as Haroun-al-Raschid]\r\n\r\nThe new Parliament met on January 23d, 1728.  It was found that the\r\nministerial majority was even greater than it had been before.  The King\r\nopened Parliament in person, and directed the Commons, who had been\r\nsummoned to the House of Peers, to return to their own House and choose\r\ntheir Speaker.  The Commons unanimously chose Arthur Onslow to this high\r\noffice.  Compton, the former Speaker, had been soothed with a peerage\r\nafter his \"evaporation.\"  Arthur Onslow was born in 1691, and had been in\r\nParliament from 1719; in July, 1728, he was made Privy Councillor.  We\r\nmay anticipate events a little for the purpose of mentioning the fact\r\nthat all the writers of his time united in ascribing to Speaker Onslow,\r\nas he has always since been called, a combination of the best attributes\r\nwhich fit a man to preside over the House of Commons.  It is said that\r\nhis election to the Speaker's chair was brought about mainly by Sir\r\nRobert Walpole, and that Walpole expected Onslow to use his great\r\nabilities and authority to suit the policy and serve the wishes of the\r\nadministration.  If this was Walpole's idea, he must soon have found\r\nhimself as much mistaken as the conclave of cardinals about whom so much\r\nis said in history, romance, and the drama, who elected one of their\r\norder as Pope because they believed him to be too feeble and nerveless to\r\nhave any will of his own, and were much amazed to find that the moment\r\nthe new Pope had been elected he suddenly became strong and\r\nenergetic--the master and not the servant.  Onslow's whole {283} conduct\r\nin the chair of the House of Commons during the many years which he\r\noccupied it displayed an absolute and fearless impartiality.  The chair\r\nhas never been better filled in English history; the very title of\r\n\"Speaker Onslow,\" ever afterwards given to him, is of itself a tribute to\r\nhis impartiality and his services.  Onslow was a man who loved letters\r\nand art, and also, it is said, loved studying all varieties of life.  It\r\nis reported of him that he used to go about disguised, like a sort of\r\neighteenth-century Haroun-al-Raschid, among the lowest classes of men, in\r\nout-of-the-way parts of the capital, for the purpose of studying the\r\nforms and manners of human life.  Legend has preserved the memory of a\r\ncertain public-house, called \"The Jews'-harp,\" where Onslow is said to\r\nhave amused himself many an evening, sitting in the chimney-corner and\r\nexchanging talk and jests with the company who frequented the place.  It\r\nis pleasant to be able to believe these stories of Speaker Onslow in that\r\nhighly artificial and formal age--that age of periwigs and paint and\r\nshallow formulas.  It is somewhat refreshing to meet with this clever man\r\nof eccentric ways, the great \"Speaker,\" who could wear his official robes\r\nwith so much true dignity, and then, when he had laid them aside, could\r\namuse himself after his own fashion, and study life in some of its\r\nqueerest corners with the freshness of a school-boy and the eye of an\r\nartist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{284}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\"THE PATRIOTS.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1728--Pulteney's place in history]\r\n\r\nThe name and the career of William Pulteney are all but forgotten in\r\nEnglish political life.  It is doubtful whether Pulteney's name, if\r\npronounced in the course of a debate in the House of Commons just now,\r\nwould bring with it any manner of idea to the minds of nine-tenths of\r\nthe listening members.  Yet Pulteney played, all unconsciously, a great\r\npart in the development of the Parliamentary life of this country.  So\r\nfar as intellectual gifts are concerned, he is not, of course, to be\r\nnamed in the same breath with a man like Burke, for example; one might\r\nas well think of comparing Offenbach with Mozart or Handel.  But the\r\ninfluence of the career of Pulteney on the English Parliament is\r\nnevertheless more distinctly marked than the influence of the career of\r\nBurke.  We are speaking now not of political thought--no man ever made\r\na greater impression on political thought than Burke has done--but only\r\nof the forms and the development of English Parliamentary systems.  For\r\nPulteney was, beyond all question, the founder of the modern practice\r\nof Parliamentary opposition.  Walpole was mainly instrumental in\r\ntransferring the seat of political power from the House of Lords to the\r\nHouse of Commons.  Never, since Walpole's time, has the House of Lords\r\nexercised any real influence over the political life of England.  This\r\nwas not Walpole's doing; it was the doing of time and change, of\r\naltered conditions and new forces.  But Walpole saw the coming change,\r\nand bent all the energies of his robust intellect to help and forward\r\nit.  Pulteney is in the same sense the author of {285} the modern\r\nprinciple of Parliamentary opposition; but there is no reason to\r\nbelieve that Pulteney saw what he was doing as clearly as Walpole did.\r\nUntil the beginning of Pulteney's brilliant career, the opposition\r\nbetween parties had been mainly a competition for the ear and the favor\r\nof the sovereign.  Thus Harley strove against Marlborough, and\r\nBolingbroke against Harley, and the Whigs against Harley and\r\nBolingbroke.  But the course of action taken by Pulteney against\r\nWalpole converted the struggle into one of party against party, inside\r\nand outside of the House of Commons.  The object sought was the command\r\nof a majority in the representative assembly.  Pulteney showed how this\r\nwas to be obtained by the voices of the public out-of-doors as well as\r\nby the votes of the elected representatives in Westminster.  Walpole\r\nhad made it clear that in the House of Commons the battle was to be\r\nfought; Pulteney showed that in the House of Commons the victory was to\r\nbe gained, not by the favor of the sovereign, but by the co-operation\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nWe have said in a former chapter that Pulteney's form of procedure,\r\nbecome now a component part of our whole Parliamentary system, brings\r\nwith it some serious disadvantages from which, for the present, it is\r\nnot easy, it is not even possible, to see any way of escape.  The\r\nprinciple of government by party will some time or other come to be put\r\nto the challenge in English political life.  For the present, however,\r\nwe have only to make the best we can of it; and no one in his senses\r\ncan doubt that it was an immense advance on the system of back-stairs\r\ninfluence and bedchamber intrigue, the policy, to use the great Condé's\r\nexpression, \"of petticoats and alcoves,\" which prevailed in the days\r\nwhen Mrs. Masham was competing with Sarah Jennings, and later still,\r\nwhen Walpole was buying his way back to power through the influence of\r\nthe sovereign's wife, in co-operation with the sovereign's paramour.\r\n\r\nThe student of English history will have to turn with {286} close\r\nattention to the reigns of the First and Second George.  In those\r\nreigns the transfer of power to the representative chamber began, and\r\nthe modern system of Parliamentary opposition grew into form.  The\r\nstudent will have to remember that the time he is studying was one when\r\nthere was no such thing known in England as a public meeting.  There\r\nwere \"demonstrations,\" as we call them now; there were crowds; there\r\nwere processions; there were tumults; there were disturbances, riots,\r\nreading of Riot Acts, dispersion of mobs, charges of cavalry,\r\n_fusillades_ of infantry; but there were no great public meetings\r\ncalled together for the discussion of momentous political questions.\r\nThe rapid growth of the popular newspaper, soon to swell up like the\r\nprophet's gourd, had hardly begun as yet.  We cannot call the\r\n_Craftsman_ a newspaper; it was rather a series of pamphlets.  It stood\r\nPulteney instead of the more modern newspaper.  He worked on public\r\nopinion with it outside the House of Commons.  Inside the House he made\r\nit his business to form a party which should assail the ministry on all\r\npoints, lie in wait to find occasion for attacking it, attack it\r\nrightly or wrongly, attack it even at the risk of exposing national\r\nweakness or bringing on national danger, keep attacking it always.  In\r\nformer days a leader of opposition had often been disdainful of the\r\nopinion of the vulgar herd out-of-doors; Pulteney and his companions\r\nset themselves to appeal especially to the prejudices, passions, and\r\nignorance of the vulgar herd.  They made it their business to create a\r\npublic opinion of their own.  They dealt in the manufacture of public\r\nopinion.  They set up political shops wherein to retail the article\r\nwhich they had thus manufactured.  Pulteney was now in his prime--still\r\nsome years inside fifty.  He was full of energy and courage, and he\r\nthrew his whole soul into his work.  Much of what he did was\r\nundoubtedly dictated by his spite against Walpole, but much, too, was\r\nthe mere outcome of his ambition, his energy, and the peculiar\r\ncharacter of his intellect.  He enjoyed playing a {287} conspicuous\r\npart and he liked attacking somebody.  People used to think at one time\r\nthat Mr. Disraeli had a profound personal hatred for Sir Robert Peel\r\nwhen he was flinging off his philippics against that great minister.\r\nIt afterwards appeared clear enough that Mr. Disraeli had no particular\r\ndislike to his opponent, but that he enjoyed attacking an important\r\nstatesman.  Pulteney, of course, did actually begin his career of\r\nimbittered opposition because of his quarrel with Walpole; but it is\r\nlikely enough that even if no quarrel had ever taken place and he never\r\nhad been Walpole's friend and colleague, he would sooner or later have\r\nbecome the foremost gladiator of opposition all the same.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1728--Materials of opposition]\r\n\r\nThe materials of opposition consisted of three political groups of men.\r\nThere were the Jacobites, under Shippen; the Tories who no longer\r\nacknowledged themselves Jacobites, and who were led by Sir William\r\nWyndham; and there were the discontented Whigs whom Pulteney led and\r\nwhose discontent he turned to his own uses.  It had long been a scheme\r\nof Bolingbroke's--up to this time it should perhaps rather be called a\r\ndream than a scheme--to combine these three groups into one distinct\r\nparty, having its bond of union in a common detestation of Walpole.\r\nThe dream now seemed likely to become a successful scheme.  The\r\nconception of this plan of opposition was unquestionably Bolingbroke's\r\nand not Pulteney's; but it fell to Pulteney's lot to work it out in the\r\nHouse of Parliament, and he performed his task with consummate ability.\r\nPulteney was probably the greatest leader of Opposition ever known in\r\nthe House of Commons, with the single exception of Mr. Disraeli.\r\nCharles Fox, with all his splendid genius for debate, was not a skilful\r\nor a patient leader of Opposition.  Perhaps he was too great of heart\r\nfor such a part; certain it is that as a leader of Opposition he made\r\nsome fatal mistakes.  Pulteney seemed cut out for the part which a\r\nstrange combination of chances had allowed him to play.  He was not\r\nmerely a debater of inexhaustible resource {288} and a master of all\r\nthe trick and craft of Parliamentary leadership; but he thoroughly\r\nunderstood the importance of public support out-of-doors, and the means\r\nof getting at it and retaining it.  Pulteney saw that the time had come\r\nwhen the English people would have their say in every political\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1728--Sir William Wyndam]\r\n\r\nBy the combined influence of Pulteney and Bolingbroke there was formed\r\na party of ultra-Whigs, who somewhat audaciously called themselves \"The\r\nPatriots.\"  Perhaps the title was first given to them by Walpole, in\r\ncontempt; if so, they accepted and adopted it.  Again and again in our\r\nhistory this phenomenon presents itself.  Some men of ability and\r\nunsatisfied ambition belonging to the Liberal party become discontented\r\nwith the policy of their leaders.  When the first opportunity arises\r\nthey make a public declaration against that policy.  In the\r\nConservative ranks there are to be found some other men, also able and\r\nalso discontented, to whom the general policy of Opposition seems\r\nunsatisfactory and feeble.  Each of these discontented parties fancies\r\nitself to be truly patriotic, public-spirited, and independent.  The\r\ntwo factions at length unite for the common good of the country; they\r\ntell the world that they are patriots, that they are the only patriots,\r\nand the world for a while believes them.  This was the condition of\r\nthings when Pulteney in Parliament joined with Sir William Wyndham, the\r\nextreme Jacobite, the Wyndham who is mentioned in Pope's poem about his\r\nTwickenham grotto, the Wyndham with whom Bolingbroke corresponded for\r\nmany years, and to whom he addressed one of his most important\r\npolitical manifestoes.  Sir William Wyndham belonged to an old\r\nSomersetshire family.  He was a staunch Tory.  He had powerful\r\nconnections; his first wife was a daughter of the haughty Duke of\r\nSomerset.  He entered Parliament and made a considerable figure there.\r\nHe had been Secretary at War and afterwards Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\nunder the Tories; he had clung to Bolingbroke's fortunes at the time of\r\nBolingbroke's {289} rupture with Harley.  He underwent the common fate\r\nof Tory statesmen on the accession of George the First; he was deprived\r\nof office, was accused of taking part in the Jacobite conspiracy, and\r\nwas committed to the Tower.  There was, however, no evidence against\r\nhim, and he resumed his political career.  His eloquence is described\r\nby Speaker Onslow as \"strong, full, and without affectation, arising\r\nchiefly from his clearness, propriety, and argumentation; in the method\r\nof which last, by a sort of induction almost peculiar to himself, he\r\nhad a force beyond any man I ever heard in public debates.\"  Lord\r\nHervey, who can be trusted not to overdo the praise of any one, says of\r\nWyndham that \"he was very far from having first-rate parts, but by a\r\ngentleman-like general behavior, a constant attendance in the House of\r\nCommons, a close application to the business of it, and frequent\r\nspeaking, he had got a sort of Parliamentary routine, and without being\r\na bright speaker was a popular one, well heard, and useful to his\r\nparty.\"  So far as we now can judge, this seems a very correct estimate\r\nof Wyndham's Parliamentary capacity and position.  He had a noble\r\npresence, singularly graceful and charming manners, and a high personal\r\ncharacter.  A combination between such a man as Pulteney and such a man\r\nas Wyndham could not but be formidable even to the most powerful\r\nminister.\r\n\r\nShippen, the leader of the Jacobites--\"honest Shippen,\" as Pope calls\r\nhim--we have often met already.  He was a straightforward, unselfish\r\nman, absolutely given up to his principles and his party.  He was well\r\nread and had written clever pamphlets and telling satirical verses.\r\nHis speeches, or such reports of them as can be got at, are full of\r\nstriking passages and impressive phrases; they are speeches which even\r\nnow one cannot read without interest.  But it would seem that Shippen\r\noften marred the effect of his ideas and his language by a rapid,\r\ncareless, and imperfect delivery.  He appears to have been one of the\r\nmen who wanted nothing but a clear {290} articulation and effective\r\nutterance to be great Parliamentary debaters, and whom that single want\r\ncondemned to comparative failure.  Those who remember the late Sir\r\nGeorge Cornewall Lewis, or, indeed, those who have heard the best\r\nspeeches of Lord Sherbrooke, when he was Mr. Robert Lowe, can probably\r\nform a good idea of what Shippen was as a Parliamentary debater.\r\nShippen was nothing of a statesman, and his occasional eccentricities\r\nof manner and conduct prevented him from obtaining all the influence\r\nwhich would otherwise have been fairly due to his talents and his\r\npolitical and personal integrity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1729--The Hessians]\r\n\r\nPulteney's party had in Parliament the frequent, indeed for a time the\r\nhabitual, assistance of Wyndham and of Shippen.  Outside Parliament\r\nBolingbroke intrigued, wrote, and worked with the indomitable energy\r\nand restless craving for activity and excitement which, despite all his\r\nprofessions of love for philosophic quiet, had been his life-long\r\ncharacteristic.  The _Craftsman_ was stimulated and guided much more\r\ndirectly by his inspiration than even by that of Pulteney.  The\r\n_Craftsman_ kept showering out articles, letters, verses, epigrams, all\r\nintended to damage the ministry, and more especially to destroy the\r\nreputation of Walpole.  All was fish that came into the _Craftsman's_\r\nnet.  Every step taken by the Government, no matter what it might be,\r\nwas made an occasion for ridicule, denunciation, and personal abuse.\r\nNot the slightest scruple was shown in the management of the\r\n_Craftsman_.  If the policy of the Government seemed to tend towards a\r\nContinental war, the _Craftsman_ cried out for peace, and vituperated\r\nthe minister who dared to think of involving England in the trumpery\r\nquarrels of foreign States.  Walpole, however, we need hardly say, made\r\nit a set purpose of his administration to maintain peace on the\r\nContinent; and as soon as the patriots began to find out in each\r\nparticular instance that his policy was still the same, they turned\r\nround and shrieked against the minister whose feebleness and cowardice\r\nwere laying England at the feet of foreign alliances and Continental\r\n{291} despots.  Walpole worked in cordial alliance with the French\r\nGovernment, the principal member of which was now Cardinal Fleury.  It\r\nbecame the object of the _Craftsman_ to hold Walpole up to contempt and\r\nderision, as the dupe of a French cardinal and the sycophant of a\r\nFrench Court.  The example of the _Craftsman_ was speedily followed by\r\npamphleteers, caricaturists, satirists, and even ballad-mongers without\r\nend.  London and the provinces were flooded with such literature.\r\nWalpole was described as \"Sir Blue String,\" the blue string being a\r\ncheap satirical allusion to the blue ribbon which was supposed to adorn\r\nhim as Knight of the Garter.  He was styled Sir Robert Brass, Sir\r\nRobert Lynn, more often simple \"Robin\" or plain \"Bob.\"  He was pictured\r\nas a systematic promoter of public corruption, as one who fattened on\r\nthe taxation wrung from the miserable English taxpayer.  His personal\r\ncharacter, his domestic life, his household expenses, the habits of his\r\nwife, his own social and other enjoyments, were coarsely criticised and\r\nlampooned.  The _Craftsman_ and its imitators attacked not only Walpole\r\nhimself, but Walpole's friends.  The political satire of that day was\r\nas indiscriminate as it was unsparing.  It was enough to be a political\r\nor even a personal friend of Walpole to become the object of the\r\n_Craftsman's_ fierce blows.  Pulteney did not even scruple to betray\r\nthe confidence of private conversation, and to disclose the words\r\nwhich, in some unguarded moments of former friendship, Walpole had\r\nspoken of George the Second when George was Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\nAn excellent opportunity was soon given to Pulteney to make an open and\r\na damaging attack on the ministry.  Horace Walpole, British Ambassador\r\nto the French Court, had been brought over from Paris to explain and\r\njustify his brother's foreign policy.  The Government put forward a\r\nresolution in the House of Commons on February 7, 1729, for a grant of\r\nsome two hundred and fifty thousand pounds \"for defraying the expense\r\nof twelve thousand Hessians taken into his Majesty's pay.\"  Even {292}\r\nif the maintenance of this force had been a positive necessity, which\r\nit certainly was not, it would, nevertheless, have been a necessity\r\nbringing with it disparagement and danger to the Government responsible\r\nfor it.  Pulteney made the most of the opportunity, and in a speech of\r\nfine old English flavor denounced the proposal of the ministers.\r\n[Sidenote: 1729--Subsidies voted] He asked with indignation whether\r\nEnglishmen were not brave enough or willing enough to defend their own\r\ncountry without calling in the assistance of foreign mercenaries.  It\r\nmight, he admitted, be some advantage to Hanover that German soldiers\r\nshould be kept in the pay of England, but he wanted to know what\r\nbenefit could come to the English people from paying and maintaining\r\nsuch a band.  These men were kept, he declared, in the pay of England,\r\nnot for the service of England, but for the service of Hanover.  It\r\nneed hardly be said that during all the earlier years of the Brunswick\r\naccession, a bare allusion to the name of Hanover was enough to stir an\r\nangry feeling in the minds of the larger number of the English people.\r\nEven the very men who most loyally supported the House of Brunswick\r\nwinced and writhed under any allusion to the manner in which the\r\ninterests of England were made subservient to the interests of Hanover.\r\nPulteney therefore took every pains to chafe those sore places with\r\nremorseless energy.  Sir William Wyndham supported Pulteney, and Sir\r\nRobert Walpole himself found it necessary to throw all his influence\r\ninto the scale on the other side.  His arguments were of a kind with\r\nwhich the House of Commons has been familiar during many generations.\r\nHis main point was, that by maintaining a large body of soldiers,\r\nHessian among the rest, the country had been enabled to avoid war.  The\r\nCourt of Vienna, with the assistance of Spanish subsidies, had been\r\nmaking preparation for war, Walpole contended; and were it not for the\r\nmaintenance of this otherwise superfluous body of troops, the Emperor\r\nof Austria would probably never have accepted the terms of peace.  \"If\r\nyou desire peace, {293} prepare for war,\" may be an excellent maxim,\r\nbut its value lies a good deal in its practical application.  It is a\r\nremarkably elastic maxim, and in times nearer to our own than those of\r\nWalpole has been made to expand into a justification of the most\r\nextravagant and unnecessary military armaments and of schemes of\r\nfortification which afterwards were abandoned before they had been half\r\nrealized.  In this instance, however, there was something more to be\r\nsaid against the proposal of the Government.  Some of the speakers in\r\nthe debate pointed out that England in former days, if it engaged in a\r\nquarrel with its neighbors, fought the quarrel out with its own\r\nstrength, and was not in the habit of buying and maintaining the forces\r\nof foreign princes to help Englishmen to hold their own.  The\r\nresolution, of course, was carried.  It was even carried by an\r\noverwhelming majority: 256 were on the \"court side,\" as it was called,\r\nagainst 91 on the \"country side.\"  Fifty thousand pounds was also voted\r\nas \"one year's subsidy to the King of Sweden,\" and twenty-five thousand\r\npounds for one year's subsidy to the Duke of Brunswick.  In order,\r\nhowever, to appease the consciences of some of those who supported the\r\nresolution as well as those who had opposed it, the Government\r\npermitted what we should now call a \"rider\" to be added to the\r\nresolution requesting his Majesty that whenever it should be necessary\r\nto take any foreign troops into his service, \"he will be graciously\r\npleased to use his endeavors that they be clothed with the manufactures\r\nof Great Britain.\"  It was supposed to be some solace to the wounded\r\nnational pride of Englishmen to be assured that if they had to pay\r\nforeigners to fight for them, the foreigners should at least not be\r\nallowed to come to this country clothed in the manufactures of their\r\nown land, but would be compelled to buy their garments over the counter\r\nof an English shop.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, February 21st, an event which led directly and indirectly to\r\nresults of some importance occurred.  Three petitions from the\r\nmerchants trading in tobacco {294} in London, Bristol, and Liverpool\r\nwere presented to the House of Commons.  These petitions complained of\r\ngreat interruptions for several years past of the trade with the\r\nBritish colonies in America by the Spaniards.  The depredations of the\r\nSpanish, it was said, endangered the entire loss of that valuable trade\r\nto England.  The Spaniards were accused of having treated such of his\r\nMajesty's subjects as had fallen into their hands in a barbarous and\r\ncruel manner.  The petitioners prayed for the consideration of the\r\nHouse of Commons, and such timely remedy as the House should think fit\r\nto recommend.  These petitions only preceded a great many others, all\r\nin substance to the same effect.  The Commons entered upon the\r\nconsideration of the subject in a Committee of the whole House, heard\r\nseveral petitioners, and examined many witnesses.  An address was\r\npresented to the Crown, asking for copies of all memorials, petitions,\r\nand representations to the late King or the present, in relation to\r\nSpanish captures of British ships.  [Sidenote: 1729--The Campeachy\r\nlogwood] Copies were also asked for of the reports laid before the King\r\nby the Commissioners of Trade and of Plantations, concerning the\r\ndispute between England and Spain, with regard to the rights of the\r\nsubjects of Great Britain to cut logwood in the Bay of Campeachy, on\r\nthe western shore of that Yucatan peninsula which juts into the Gulf of\r\nMexico.  English traders had been for a long time in the habit of\r\ncutting logwood along the shores in the Bay of Campeachy, and the\r\nlogwood trade had come to be one of the greatest importance to the West\r\nIndies and to England.  The Spanish Government claimed the right to put\r\na stop to this cutting of logwood, and the Spanish Viceroy and Governor\r\nhad in some instances declared that they would dislodge the Englishmen\r\nfrom the settlements which they had established, and even treat them as\r\npirates if they persisted in their trade.  There was, in fact, all the\r\nmaterial growing up for a serious quarrel between England and Spain.\r\n\r\nDespite the recent treaties which were supposed to {295} secure the\r\npeace of Europe, the times were very critical.  \"The British nation,\"\r\nsays a contemporary writer, \"had for many years past been in a state of\r\nuncertainty, scarce knowing friends from foes, or indeed whether we had\r\neither.\"  Each new treaty seemed only to disturb the balance of power,\r\nas it was called, in a new way.  The Quadruple Alliance was intended to\r\nrectify the defects of the Treaty of Utrecht; but it gave too much\r\npower to the Emperor, and it increased the bitterness and the\r\ndiscontent of the King of Spain.  The Treaty of Vienna, made between\r\nthe Empire and Spain, was justly regarded in England as portending\r\ndanger to this country.  It was even more dangerous than Englishmen in\r\ngeneral supposed at the time, although Walpole knew its full purport\r\nand menace.  The Treaty of Vienna led to the Treaty of Hanover, an\r\narrangement made in the closing years of George the First's reign\r\nbetween Great Britain, France, and Prussia, by virtue of which if any\r\none of the contracting parties were to be attacked, the other two were\r\npledged to come to the assistance with funds and with arms.  All these\r\narrangements were in the highest degree artificial; some of them might\r\nfairly be described as unnatural.  It might be taken for granted that\r\nnot one of the States whom they professed to bind to this side or to\r\nthat would hold to the engagements one hour longer than would serve her\r\nown interests.  No safety was secured by these overlapping treaties; no\r\none had any faith in them.  It was quite true that England did not know\r\nher friends from her enemies about the time at which we have now\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nThe dispute between England and Spain concerning the question of the\r\nCampeachy logwood was to involve a controversy as to the interpretation\r\nof certain passages in the Treaty of Utrecht.  It was distinctly a\r\nmatter for calm consideration, for compromise, and for an amicable\r\nsettlement.  But each of the two parties mainly concerned showed its\r\ndesire to push its own claim to an extreme.  English traders have never\r\nbeen particularly {296} moderate or considerate in pressing their\r\nsupposed rights to trade with foreign countries.  In this instance they\r\nwere strongly backed up, encouraged, and stimulated by the band of\r\nEnglishmen who chose to call themselves \"The Patriots.\"  Few of the\r\n\"Patriots,\" we venture to think, cared a rush about the question of the\r\nCampeachy logwood, or were very deeply grieved because Spain bore\r\nherself in a high-handed fashion towards certain English merchants and\r\nship-owners.  But the opportunity seemed to the \"Patriots\" admirably\r\nadapted for worrying and harassing, not the Spaniards, but the\r\nadministration of Sir Robert Walpole.  They used the opportunity to the\r\nvery full.  [Sidenote: 1729--Gibraltar] The debates on the conduct of\r\nSpain brought out in the House of Lords the acknowledgment of the fact\r\nthat King George I. had at one time actually written to the Government\r\nof Spain, distinctly undertaking to bring about the restitution of\r\nGibraltar.  A copy of the letter in French, with a translation, was\r\nlaid before the House.  It seemed that on June 1, 1721, George, the\r\nlate King, wrote to the King of Spain, \"Sir, my brother,\" a letter\r\nconcerning the treaties then in the course of being re-established\r\nbetween England and Spain.  In that letter occurred these words: \"I do\r\nno longer balance to assure your Majesty of my readiness to satisfy you\r\nwith regard to your demand touching the restitution of Gibraltar;\r\npromising you to make use of the first favorable opportunity to\r\nregulate this article with the consent of my Parliament.\"  The House of\r\nLords had a long and warm debate on this subject.  A resolution was\r\nproposed, declaring that \"for the honor of his Majesty, and the\r\npreservation and security of the trade and commerce of this kingdom,\"\r\ncare should be taken \"that the King of Spain do renounce all claim and\r\npretension to Gibraltar and the island of Minorca, in plain and strong\r\nterms.\"  This resolution, however, was thought in the end to be rather\r\ntoo strong, and it was modified into a declaration that the Lords \"do\r\nentirely rely upon his Majesty, that he will, for the maintaining the\r\nhonor and securing the {297} trade of this kingdom, take effectual care\r\nin the present treaty to preserve his undoubted right to Gibraltar and\r\nthe island of Minorca.\"  This resolution was communicated to the House\r\nof Commons, and the Lords asked for a conference with that House in the\r\nPainted Chamber.  The Commons had a long debate on the subject.  The\r\nOpposition strongly denounced the ministers who had advised the late\r\nKing to write such a letter, and declared that it implied a positive\r\npromise to surrender Gibraltar to Spain.  The courtiers, as the\r\nsupporters of the Ministry were then called, to distinguish them from\r\nthe country party--that is to say, the Opposition--endeavored to\r\nqualify and make light of the expressions used in the late King's\r\nletter, to show that they were merely hypothetical and conditional, and\r\ninsisted that effectual care had since been taken in every way to\r\nmaintain the right of England to Gibraltar.  The country party moved\r\nthat words be added to the Lords' resolution requiring \"that all\r\npretensions on the part of the Crown of Spain to the said places be\r\nspecifically given up.\"  Two hundred and sixty-seven votes against one\r\nhundred and eleven refused the addition of these words as unnecessary,\r\nand too much in the nature of a challenge and defiance to Spain.  But\r\nthe motion that \"this House does agree with the Lords in the said\r\nresolution\" was carried without a division, the Court party not\r\nventuring to offer any objection to it.  The King received the address\r\nof both Houses on Tuesday, March 25th, and returned an answer thanking\r\nthem for the confidence reposed in him, and assuring them that \"I will\r\ntake effectual care, as I have hitherto done, to secure my undoubted\r\nright to Gibraltar and the island of Minorca.\"\r\n\r\nThe difficulty was over for the present.  The Government contrived to\r\narrange a new treaty with Spain, the Treaty of Seville, in which France\r\nalso was included.  This treaty settled for the time the disputes about\r\nEnglish trade with the New World, and the claims of Spain for a\r\nrestoration of Gibraltar were, indirectly at least, {298} given up.\r\nPerhaps the whole story is chiefly interesting now as affording an\r\nillustration of the manner in which the Patriots turned everything to\r\naccount for their one great purpose of harassing the administration of\r\nSir Robert Walpole.  All the patriotic effusiveness about the undoubted\r\nright of England to Gibraltar was merely well-painted passion.  Such\r\nsentiment as exists in the English mind with regard to the possession\r\nof \"the Rock\" now, did not exist, had not had time to come into\r\nexistence, then.  Gibraltar was taken in 1704; its possession was\r\nconfirmed to England by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713.  Since that time\r\nEnglish Ministers had again and again been considering the expediency\r\nof restoring Gibraltar to the Spaniards.  Stanhope had been in favor of\r\nthe restoration; Townshend and Carteret had been in favor of it.  Some\r\nof the Patriots themselves, before they came to be dubbed Patriots, had\r\nbeen in favor of it.  Only the unreasonable and insolent behavior of\r\nSpain herself stood at one time in the way of the restitution.\r\nGibraltar was one capture, like many others; captured territory changed\r\nand changed hands with each new arrangement in those days.  Minorca,\r\nwhich was included with Gibraltar in the resolution of the two Houses\r\nof Parliament and the consequent promise of the King, was taken by the\r\nEnglish forces shortly after the capture of Gibraltar, and was settled\r\nupon England by the same Treaty of Utrecht.  Yet, as we all know, it\r\nwas given up by England at the peace of Amiens, and no tears of grief\r\nwere shed by any English eyes.  But the discovery that the late King\r\nhad at one time been willing to restore Gibraltar to Spain for a\r\nconsideration came in most opportunely for the Patriots.  To most of\r\nthem it was, of course, no discovery at all.  They had always known of\r\nthe intention, and some of them had approved of it.  None the less\r\nshrill were their cries of surprise; none the less vociferous their\r\nshouts of patriotic anger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{299}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nA VICTORY FOR THE PATRIOTS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1729--Death of Congreve]\r\n\r\nLiterature lost some great names in the early part of George the\r\nSecond's reign.  William Congreve and Richard Steele both died in 1729.\r\nCongreve's works do not belong to the time of which we are writing.  He\r\nwas not sixty years old when he died, and he had long ceased to take\r\nany active part in literature.  Swift deplores, in a letter to an\r\nacquaintance, \"the death of our friend Mr. Congreve, whom I loved from\r\nmy youth, and who surely, besides his other talents, was a very\r\nagreeable companion.\"  Swift adds that Congreve \"had the misfortune to\r\nsquander away a very good constitution in his younger days,\" and \"upon\r\nhis own account I could not much desire the continuance of his life\r\nunder so much pain and so many infirmities.\"  Congreve was beyond\r\ncomparison the greatest English comic dramatist of his time.  Since the\r\ndays of Ben Jonson and until the days of Sheridan there was no one who\r\ncould fairly be compared with him.  His comedy was not in the least\r\nlike the bold, broad, healthy, Aristophanic humor of Ben Jonson; the\r\ntwo stand better in contrast than in comparison.  Jonson drew from the\r\nwhole living English world of his time; Congreve drew from the men and\r\nwomen whom he had seen in society.  Congreve took society as he found\r\nit in his earlier days.  The men and women with whom he then mixed were\r\nfor the most part flippant, insincere, corrupt, and rather proud of\r\ntheir corruption; and Congreve filled his plays with figures very\r\nlifelike for such a time.  He has not drawn many men or women whom one\r\ncould admire.  Even his heroines, if they are chaste in their lives,\r\n{300} are anything but pure in their conversation, and seem to have no\r\nmoral principle beyond that which is represented by what Heine calls an\r\n\"anatomical chastity.\"  Angelica, the heroine of \"Love for Love,\" is\r\nevidently meant by Congreve to be all that a charming young\r\nEnglishwoman ought to be; and she is charming, fresh, and fascinating\r\neven still.  But she occasionally talks in a manner which would be a\r\nlittle strong for a barrack-room now; and nothing gives her more\r\ngenuine delight than to twit her kind, fond old uncle with his wife's\r\ninfidelities, to make it clear to him that all the world is acquainted\r\nwith the full particulars of his shame, and to sport with his jealous\r\nagonies.  Congreve was the first dramatic author who put an English\r\nseaman on the stage; and, after his characteristic fashion, he made his\r\nBen Legend a selfish, coarse, and ruffianly lout.  But if one cannot\r\nadmire many of Congreve's characters, on the other hand one cannot help\r\nadmiring every sentence they speak.  The only fault to be found with\r\ntheir talk is that it is too witty, too brilliant, for any manner of\r\nreal life.  Society would have to be all composed of male and female\r\nCongreves to make such conversation possible.  There is more strength,\r\noriginality, and depth in it than even in the conversation in \"The\r\nRivals\" and \"The School for Scandal.\"  The same fault has been found\r\nwith Sheridan which is to be found with Congreve.  We need not make too\r\nmuch of it.  No warning example is called for.  There will never be\r\nmany dramatists whose dialogue will deserve the censure of critics on\r\nthe ground that it is too witty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1729--Death of Steele]\r\n\r\nOf Steele we have often had occasion to speak.  His fame has been\r\ngrowing rather than fading with time.  At one period he was ranked by\r\ncritics as far below the level of Addison; few men now would not set\r\nhim on a pedestal as high.  He was more natural, more simple, more\r\nfresh than Addison.  There is some justice in the remark of Hazlitt\r\nthat \"Steele seems to have gone into his closet chiefly to set down\r\nwhat he had observed out-of-doors;\" {301} while Addison appears \"to\r\nhave spent most of his time in his study,\" spinning out to the utmost\r\nthere the hints \"which he borrowed from Steele or took from nature.\"\r\nEvery one, however, will cordially say with Hazlitt, \"I am far from\r\nwishing to depreciate Addison's talents, but I am anxious to do justice\r\nto Steele.\"  There are not many names in English literature round which\r\na greater affection clings than that of Steele.  Leigh Hunt, in writing\r\nof Congreve, speaks of \"the love of the highest aspirations\" which he\r\nsometimes displays, and which makes us think of what he might have been\r\nunder happier and purer auspices.  Leigh Hunt refers in especial to\r\nCongreve's essay in the _Tatler_ on the character of Lady Elizabeth\r\nHastings, whom Congreve calls Aspasia--\"an effusion so full of\r\nenthusiasm for the moral graces, and worded with an appearance of\r\nsincerity so cordial, that we can never read it without thinking it\r\nmust have come from Steele.\"  \"It is in this essay,\" Leigh Hunt goes\r\non, \"that he says one of the most elegant and truly loving things that\r\nwere ever uttered by an unworldly passion: 'To love her is a liberal\r\neducation.'\"  Leigh Hunt's critical judgment was better than his\r\ninformation.  The words \"to love her is a liberal education\" are by\r\nSteele, and not by Congreve.  They do not appear in the essay by\r\nCongreve on the character of Lady Elizabeth Hastings, but in a\r\nsubsequent essay by Steele, in which, after a fashion common enough in\r\nthe _Tatler_ and the _Spectator_, one author takes up some figure\r\ncreated or described by another, and gives it new touches and commends\r\nit afresh to the reader.  Steele was doing this with Congreve's picture\r\nof Aspasia, and it was then that he crowned the whole work by the\r\nexquisite and immortal words which Leigh Hunt could never read without\r\nthinking they must have come from the man who was in fact their author.\r\n\r\nIf literature had its losses in these years, it had also its gains.\r\nNot long before the time at which we have now arrived, English\r\nliterature had achieved three great successes.  Pope wrote the first\r\nthree books of his {302} \"Dunciad,\" Swift published his \"Gulliver's\r\nTravels,\" and Gay set the town wild with his \"Beggar's Opera.\"  We are\r\nfar from any thought of classifying the \"Beggar's Opera\" as a work of\r\nart on a level with the \"Dunciad\" or \"Gulliver's Travels,\" but in its\r\nway it is a masterpiece.  It is thoroughly original, fresh, and vivid.\r\nIt added one or two distinctly new figures to the humorous drama.  It\r\nis clever as a satire and charming as a story.  One cannot be surprised\r\nthat when it had the attraction of novelty the public raved about it.\r\nTo say anything about \"Gulliver's Travels\" or the \"Dunciad,\" except to\r\nnote the historical fact that each was published, would of course be\r\nmere superfluity and waste of words.\r\n\r\nIn 1731 the first steps were taken in a reform of some importance in\r\nthe liberation of our legal procedure.  It was arranged that English\r\nshould be substituted for Latin in the presentments, indictments,\r\npleadings, and all other documents used in our courts of law.  The\r\nearly stages of this most wise and needful reform were met with much\r\nopposition by lawyers and pedants.  One main argument employed in favor\r\nof the retention of the old system was that, if the language of our\r\nlegal documents were to be changed, no man would be at the pains of\r\nstudying Latin any more, and that in a few years no one would be able\r\nto read a word of some of our own most valuable historical records.  It\r\nwas mildly suggested on the other side that there would always be some\r\nmen among us who \"either out of curiosity, or for the sake of gain,\"\r\nwould make it their business to keep up the knowledge of Latin, and\r\nthat a very few of such antiquarians would suffice to give the country\r\nall the information drawn from Latin records which it could possibly\r\nrequire or care to have.  We have had some experience since that time,\r\nand it does not appear that the disuse of Latin in our legal documents\r\nhas led to its falling into absolute disuse among reading men.  There\r\nare still among us, and apparently will always be, persons who, \"either\r\nout of curiosity, or for the sake of gain,\" keep up their knowledge of\r\nLatin.  {303} The curiosity to read Virgil and Horace and Cicero and\r\nCaesar, in the tongue which those authors employed, is more keen than\r\nit ever was before.  Men indulge themselves freely in it, even without\r\nreference to the sake of gain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1731--Quarrel of Walpole and Townshend]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a change long foreseen by those who were in the inner\r\npolitical circles was rapidly approaching.  The combination between\r\nWalpole and his brother-in-law, Lord Townshend, was about to be broken\r\nup.  It had for a long time been a question whether it was to be the\r\nfirm of Townshend and Walpole, or Walpole and Townshend; and of late\r\nyears the question was becoming settled.  If the firm was to endure at\r\nall, it must clearly be Walpole and Townshend.  Walpole had been\r\ngrowing every day in power and influence.  The King, as well as the\r\nQueen, treated him openly and privately as the head of the Government.\r\nTownshend saw this, and felt bitterly aggrieved.  He had for a long\r\ntime been a much more powerful personage socially than Walpole, and he\r\ncould not bear with patience the supremacy which Walpole was all too\r\ncertainly obtaining.  Great part of that supremacy was due to Walpole's\r\nsuperiority of talents; but something was due also to the fact that the\r\nHouse of Commons was becoming a much more important assembly than the\r\nHouse of Lords.  The result was inevitable.  Townshend for a long time\r\nstruggled against it.  He tried to intrigue against Walpole; he did his\r\nbest to ingratiate himself with the King.  He was a man of austere\r\ncharacter and stainless life; but he seems, nevertheless, to have tried\r\nat one time the merest arts of the political intriguer to supplant his\r\nbrother-in-law in the favor and confidence of the King.  Perhaps he\r\nmight have succeeded--it is at least possible--but for the watchful\r\nintelligence of Queen Caroline.  She saw through all Townshend's\r\nschemes, and took care that they should not succeed.  At last the two\r\nrivals quarrelled.  Their quarrel broke out very openly, in the\r\ndrawing-room of a lady, and in the presence of several distinguished\r\n{304} persons.  From hot words they were going on to a positive\r\npersonal struggle, when the spectators at last intervened to \"pluck\r\nthem asunder,\" in the words of the King in \"Hamlet.\"  They were plucked\r\nasunder, and then there was talk of a duel.  The friends of both\r\nsucceeded in preventing this scandal, but the brothers-in-law were\r\nnever thoroughly reconciled, and after a short time Lord Townshend\r\nresigned his office.  He withdrew from public life altogether, and\r\ndevoted his remaining years to the enjoyment of the country and the\r\ncultivation of agriculture.  It is to his credit that when once he had\r\ngiven way to the superior influence of Walpole, he did not afterwards\r\ncabal against him, or try to injure him, according to the fashion of\r\nthe statesmen of the time.  On the contrary, when he was once pressed\r\nto join in an attack on Walpole's ministry, he firmly refused to do\r\nanything of the kind.  He said he had resolved to take no further part\r\nin political contests, and he did not mean to break his resolution.  He\r\nwas particularly determined not to depart from his resolve in this\r\ncase, he explained, because his temper was hot, and he was apprehensive\r\nthat he might be hurried away by personal resentment to take a course\r\nwhich in his cooler moments he should have to regret.  Nothing in his\r\npublic life, perhaps, became him so well as his dignified conduct in\r\nhis retirement.  His place in history is not strongly marked; in this\r\nhistory we shall not hear of him any more.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1730--Signs of change in foreign policy]\r\n\r\nColonel Stanhope, who had made the Treaty of Seville, and had been\r\nraised to the peerage as Lord Harrington for his services, succeeded\r\nTownshend as Secretary of State.  Horace Walpole, the brother of\r\nRobert, was at his own request recalled from Paris.  Walpole, the\r\nPrime-minister, had begun to see that it would be necessary for the\r\nfuture to have something like a good understanding with Austria.  The\r\nfriendship with France had been a priceless advantage in its time, but\r\nWalpole believed that it had served its turn.  It was valuable to\r\nEngland chiefly because it had enabled the Sovereign to keep {305} the\r\nmovements of the Stuart party in check, and Walpole hoped that the\r\nHouse of Hanover was now secure on the throne, and believed, with too\r\nsanguine a confidence, that no other effort would be made to disturb\r\nit.  Moreover, he saw some reason to think that France, no longer\r\nguided by the political intelligence of a man like the Duke of Orleans,\r\nwas drawing a little too close in her relationship with Spain.  Walpole\r\nwas already looking forward to the coming of a time when it might be\r\nnecessary for England to strengthen herself against France and Spain,\r\nand he therefore desired to get into a good understanding with the\r\nEmperor and Austria.\r\n\r\nWalpole now had the Government entirely to himself.  He was not merely\r\nall-powerful in the administration, he actually was the administration.\r\nThe King knew him to be indispensable; the Queen put the fullest trust\r\nin him.  His only trouble was with the intrigues of Bolingbroke and the\r\nopposition of Pulteney.  The latter sometimes affected what would have\r\nbeen called at the time a \"mighty unconcern\" about political affairs.\r\nWriting once to Pope, he says, \"Mrs. Pulteney is now in labor; if she\r\ndoes well, and brings me a boy, I shall not care one sixpence how much\r\nlonger Sir Robert governs England, or Horace governs France.\"  This was\r\nwritten while Horace Walpole was still Ambassador at the French Court.\r\nPulteney, however, was very far from feeling anything like the\r\nphilosophical indifference which he expressed in his letter to Pope.\r\nHe never ceased to attack everything done by the Ministry, and to\r\nsatirize every word said by Walpole.  At the same time Pulteney was\r\ncomplaining bitterly to his friends of the attacks made on him by the\r\nsupporters of Walpole.  On February 9, 1730, he wrote a letter to\r\nSwift, in which he says that \"certain people\" had been driven by want\r\nof argument \"to that last resort of calling names: villain, traitor,\r\nseditious rascal, and such ingenious appellations have frequently been\r\nbestowed on a couple of friends of yours.\"  \"Such usage,\" he\r\ncomplacently adds, \"has made it {306} necessary to return the same\r\npolite language; and there has been more Billingsgate stuff uttered\r\nfrom the press within these two months than ever was known before.\"\r\nSwift himself had previously written to his friend Dr. Sheridan a\r\nletter in which he declared that \"Walpole is peevish and disconcerted,\r\nstoops to the vilest offices of hireling scoundrels to write\r\nBillingsgate of the lowest and most prostitute kind, and has none but\r\nbeasts and blockheads for his penmen, whom he pays in ready guineas\r\nvery liberally.\"  One would have thought that beasts and blockheads\r\ncould hardly prove very formidable enemies to Swift and Bolingbroke and\r\nPulteney.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1730--Lord Hervey]\r\n\r\nOne of the incidents in the controversy carried on by the Ministerial\r\npenmen and the _Craftsman_ was a duel between Pulteney and Lord Hervey.\r\nPulteney and his friends were apparently under the impression that they\r\nhad a right to a monopoly of personal abuse, and they resented any\r\neffusion of the kind from the other side as a breach of their\r\nprivilege.  Hervey had written a tract called \"Sedition and Defamation\r\ndisplayed, in a Letter to the Author of the _Craftsman_;\" and this led\r\nto a new outburst of passion on both sides.  Pulteney stigmatized\r\nHervey, on account of his effeminate appearance, as a thing that was\r\nhalf man, half woman, and a duel took place in which Hervey was\r\nwounded.  Hervey was a remarkable man.  His physical frame was as\r\nfeeble as that of Voltaire.  He suffered from epilepsy and a variety of\r\nother ailments.  He had to live mainly on a dietary of ass's milk.  His\r\nface was so meagre and so pallid, or rather livid, that he used to\r\npaint and make up like an actress or a fine lady.  Pope, who might have\r\nbeen considerate to the weak of frame, was merciless in his ridicule of\r\nHervey.  He ridiculed him as Sporus, who could neither feel satire nor\r\nsense, and as Lord Fanny.  Yet Hervey could appreciate satire and\r\nsense; could write satire and sense.  He was a man of very rare\r\ncapacity.  He had already distinguished himself as a debater in the\r\nHouse of Commons, and was afterwards to distinguish himself as a {307}\r\ndebater in the House of Lords.  He wrote pretty verses and clever\r\npamphlets, and he has left to the world a collection of \"Memoirs of the\r\nReign of George the Second,\" which will always be read for its\r\nvivacity, its pungency, its bitterness, and its keen, penetrating\r\ngood-sense.  Hervey succeeded in obtaining the hand of one of the most\r\nbeautiful women of the day, the charming Mary Lepell, whose name has\r\nbeen celebrated in more than one poetical panegyric by Pope, and he\r\ncaptivated the heart of one of the royal princesses.  The historical\r\nreader must strike a sort of balance for himself in getting at an\r\nestimate of Hervey's character.  No man has been more bitterly\r\ndenounced by his enemies or more warmly praised by his friends.\r\nAffectation, insincerity, prodigality, selfishness, servility to the\r\ngreat, contempt for the humble, are among the qualities his opponents\r\nascribe to him.  According to his friends, his cynicism was a mere\r\naffectation to hide a sensitive and generous nature; his bitterness\r\narose from his disappointment at finding so few men or women who came\r\nup to a really high standard of nobleness; his homage of the great was\r\nbut the half-disguised mockery of a scornful philosopher.  Probably the\r\npicture drawn by the friends is on the whole more near to life than\r\nthat painted by the enemies.  The world owes him some thanks for a\r\nreally interesting book, the very boldness and bitterness of which\r\nenhance to a certain extent its historical value.  At this time Hervey\r\nwas but little over thirty years of age.  He was the son of the first\r\nEarl of Bristol by a second marriage, had been educated at Westminster\r\nSchool and at Clare Hall, Cambridge; had gone early through the usual\r\nround of Continental travels, and became a friend of George the First's\r\ngrandson, now Prince of Wales, at Hanover.  This friendship not merely\r\ndid not endure, but soon turned into hate.  Hervey was an admirer of\r\nLady Mary Wortley Montagu, and was admired by her; but her own\r\nassurances, which may be trusted to, declared that there had been\r\nnothing warmer than friendship between them.  Lady Mary afterwards\r\n{308} maintained that the relationship between Hervey and her\r\nestablished the possibility of \"a long and steady friendship subsisting\r\nbetween two persons of different sexes without the least admixture of\r\nlove.\"  Hervey was in his day a somewhat free and liberal lover of\r\nwomen, and it is not surprising that the world should have regarded his\r\nacquaintanceship with Lady Mary as something warmer than mere\r\nfriendship.  We shall have occasion to refer to Hervey's memoirs of the\r\nreign of George the Second more than once hereafter, and may perhaps\r\nnow cite a few words which Hervey himself says in vindication of their\r\nsincerity and their historical accuracy; \"No one who did not live in\r\nthese times will, I dare say, believe but some of those I describe in\r\nthese papers must have had some hard features and deformities\r\nexaggerated and heightened by the malice and ill-nature of the painter\r\nwho drew them.  Others, perhaps, will say that at least no painter is\r\nobliged to draw every wart or wen or humpback in its full proportions,\r\nand that I might have softened these blemishes where I found them.  But\r\nI am determined to report everything just as it is, or at least just as\r\nit appears to me; and those who have a curiosity to see courts and\r\ncourtiers dissected, must bear with the dirt they find in laying open\r\nsuch minds with as little nicety and as much patience as, in a\r\ndissection of their bodies, if they wanted to see that operation, they\r\nmust submit to the disgust.\"\r\n\r\nHervey fought with spirit and effect on the side of Walpole, although\r\nLady Hervey strongly disliked the Minister and was disliked by him.\r\nWalpole had at one time, it was said, made unsuccessful love to the\r\nbeautiful and witty Molly Lepell, and he did not forgive her because of\r\nher scornful rejection of his ponderous attempts at gallantry.  Hervey,\r\nnevertheless, took Walpole's side, and proved to be an ally of some\r\nimportance.  A great struggle was approaching, in which the whole\r\nstrength of Walpole's hold on the Sovereign and the country was to be\r\ntested by the severest strain.\r\n\r\n{309}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1730--The Sinking Fund]\r\n\r\nWalpole was, as we have said more than once, the first of the great\r\nfinancier statesmen of England.  He was the first statesman who\r\nproperly appreciated the virtue and the value of mere economy in the\r\ndisposal of a nation's revenues.  He was the first to devise anything\r\nlike a solid and symmetrical plan for the fair adjustment of taxation.\r\nSometimes he had recourse to rather poor and common-place artifices, as\r\nin the case of his proposal to meet a certain financial strain by\r\nborrowing half a million from the Sinking Fund.  This proposal he\r\ncarried by a large majority, in spite of the most vehement and even\r\nfurious opposition on the part of the Patriots.  It must be owned that\r\nthe Patriots were right enough in the principle of their objection to\r\nthis encroachment on the Sinking Fund, although their predictions as to\r\nthe ruin it must bring upon the country were preposterous.  Borrowing\r\nfrom a sinking fund is always rather a shabby dodge; but it is a trick\r\nfamiliar to all statesmen in difficulties, and Walpole did no worse\r\nthan many statesmen of later days, who, with the full advantages of a\r\nsound and well-developed financial system, have shown that they were\r\nnot able to do any better.\r\n\r\nThe Patriots seem to have made up their minds to earn their title.\r\nThey fought the \"Court,\" or Ministerial, party on a variety of issues.\r\nThey supported motions for the reduction of the numbers of the army,\r\nand they declaimed against the whole principle of a standing army with\r\npatriotic passion, which sometimes appeared for the time quite genuine.\r\nThey brought illustrations of all kinds, applicable and inapplicable,\r\nfrom Greek and Roman, from French and Spanish history, even from\r\nEastern history, to show that a standing army was invariably the\r\ninstrument of despotism and the forerunner of doom to the liberties of\r\na people.  The financial policy of the Government gave them frequent\r\nopportunities for using the sword of the partisan behind the fluttering\r\ncloak of the patriot.  On both sides of the House there was\r\nconsiderable confusion of ideas on the subject of political economy\r\n{310} and the incidence of taxation.  Walpole was ahead of his own\r\nparty as well as of his opponents on such subjects; his followers were\r\nlittle more enlightened than his antagonists.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1732--The American colonies]\r\n\r\nIn 1732 there was presented to the House of Commons an interesting\r\nreport from the Commissioners for Trade and Plantations on \"the state\r\nof his Majesty's colonies and plantations in America, with respect to\r\nany laws made, manufactures set up, and trade carried on there, which\r\nmay affect the trade, navigation, and manufactures of this kingdom.\"\r\nFrom this report we learn that at the time there were three different\r\nsystems of government prevailing in the American colonies.  Some\r\nprovinces were immediately under the administration of the Crown: these\r\nwere Nova Scotia, New Hampshire, the Jerseys, New York, Virginia, the\r\ntwo Carolinas, Bermuda, Bahama Islands, Jamaica, Barbadoes, and the\r\nLeeward Islands.  Others were vested in proprietors--Pennsylvania, for\r\nexample, and Maryland--and the Bahamas and the two Carolinas had not\r\nlong before been in the same condition.  There were three Charter\r\nGovernments, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, in which the\r\npower was divided between the Crown and the population, where the\r\npeople chose their representative assemblies, and the Governor was\r\ndependent upon the Assembly for his annual support, \"which,\" as the\r\nreport observed ingenuously, \"has so frequently laid the Governor of\r\nsuch a province under temptations of giving up the prerogative of the\r\nCrown and the interest of Great Britain.\"  The report contains a very\r\nfull account of the state of manufactures in all the provinces.  New\r\nYork, for example, had no manufactures \"that deserved mentioning;\" the\r\ntrade there \"consisted chiefly in furs, whalebone, oil, pitch, tar, and\r\nprovisions.\"  In Massachusetts \"the inhabitants worked up their wool\r\nand flax, and made an ordinary coarse cloth for their own use, but did\r\nnot export any.\"  In Pennsylvania the \"chief trade lay in the\r\nexportation of provisions and lumber,\" and there were {311} \"no\r\nmanufactures established, their clothing and utensils for their houses\r\nbeing all imported from Great Britain.\"  For the object of the whole\r\nreport was not to discover how far the energy of the colonists was\r\ndeveloping the resources of the colonies, in order that the Government\r\nand the people of England might be gratified with a knowledge of the\r\nprogress made, and give their best encouragement to further progress.\r\nThe inquiry was set on foot in order to find out whether the colonists\r\nwere presuming to manufacture for themselves any goods which they ought\r\nby right to buy from English makers, and to recommend steps by which\r\nsuch audacious enterprises might be rebuked and prevented.  This is the\r\navowed object of the report, and we find governor after governor\r\nassuring the Commissioners earnestly and plaintively that the\r\npopulation of his province really manufacture nothing, or at all events\r\nnothing that could possibly interfere with the sacred privileges of the\r\nEnglish monopolists.  The report significantly recommends the House of\r\nCommons to take into consideration the question \"whether it might not\r\nbe expedient to give these colonies proper encouragements for turning\r\ntheir industry to such manufactures and products as might be of service\r\nto Great Britain, and more particularly to the production of all kinds\r\nof naval stores.\"  The proper encouragement given to this sort of\r\nproductiveness would imply, of course, proper discouragement given to\r\nanything else.  The colonies were to exist merely for the convenience\r\nand benefit of the so-called mother country, a phrase surely of\r\nsardonic impressiveness.  Such, however, was the common feeling of that\r\nday in England.  It was so with regard to India; it was so with regard\r\nto Ireland.  The story of the pelican was reversed.  The pelican did\r\nnot in this case feed her young with her blood; the young were expected\r\nto give their blood to feed the pelican.\r\n\r\nThe real strain was to come when Walpole should introduce his famous\r\nand long-expected scheme for a reform in the customs and excise laws.\r\nWalpole's scheme {312} was inspired by two central ideas.  One of these\r\nwas to diminish the amount of taxation imposed on the land of the\r\ncountry, and make up the deficiency by indirect taxation; the other was\r\nto reduce the customs duties by substituting as far as possible an\r\nexcise duty.  Walpole would have desired something like free-trade as\r\nregarded the introduction of food and the raw materials of manufacture.\r\nLet these be got into the country as easily and freely as possible was\r\nhis principle, and then let us see afterwards how we can adjust the\r\nexcise duties so as to produce the largest amount of revenue with the\r\nsmallest injury to the interest of the consumer, and with the minimum\r\nof waste.  His design was that the necessaries of life and the raw\r\nmaterials of manufacture should remain as nearly as possible untaxed,\r\nand that the revenue of the country should be collected from land and\r\nfrom luxuries.  We do not mean to say that the plans which Walpole\r\npresented to the country were faithful in all their details to these\r\ncentral ideas.  One scheme at least which he laid before Parliament was\r\npositively at variance with the main principles which he had long been\r\ntrying to establish.  But in considering the whole controversy between\r\nhim and his opponents, the reader may take it for granted that such\r\nwere the principles by which his financial policy was inspired.  He had\r\nbeen moving quietly in this direction for some time.  He had removed\r\nthe import duties from tea, coffee, and chocolate, and made them\r\nsubject to inland or excise duties.  In 1732 he revived the salt tax.\r\nThe Bill which was introduced on February 9, 1732, to accomplish this\r\nobject, met with a strong opposition in both Houses of Parliament.\r\nWalpole's speech in introducing the motion for the revival of the tax\r\ncontained a very clear statement of his financial creed.  \"Where every\r\nman contributes a small share, a great sum may be raised for the public\r\nservice without any man's being sensible of what he pays; whereas a\r\nsmall sum raised upon a few, lies heavy upon each particular man, and\r\nis the more grievous in that it is unjust; for where {313} the benefit\r\nis mutual, the expense ought to be in common.\" [Sidenote:\r\n1732--Opposition alarm] The general principle is unassailable; but\r\nWalpole seems to us to have been quite wrong in his application of it\r\nto such an impost as the salt tax.  \"Of all the taxes I ever could\r\nthink of,\" he argued, \"there is not one more general, nor one less\r\nfelt, than that of the duty upon salt.\"  He described it as a \"tax that\r\nevery man in the nation contributes to according to his circumstances\r\nand condition in life.\"  This is exactly what every man does not do.\r\nThe family of the rich man does not by any means consume more salt than\r\nthe family of the poor man in proportion to their respective incomes.\r\nPulteney knocked Walpole's argument all to pieces in a speech of\r\nremarkable force and ingenuity even for him.  There was something\r\nhonestly pathetic in his appeal on behalf of the poor man, whom the\r\nduty on salt would touch most nearly.  The tax, he said, would be at\r\nleast one shilling a head for every man or woman able to work; to a man\r\nwith a family it would average four shillings and sixpence a year.\r\nSuch a yearly sum \"may be looked upon as a trifle by a gentleman of a\r\nlarge estate and easy circumstances, but a poor man feels sometimes\r\nseverely the want of a shilling; many a poor man has for want of a\r\nshilling been obliged to pawn the only whole coat he had to his back,\r\nand has never been able to redeem it again.  Even a farthing to a poor\r\nman is a considerable sum; what shifts do the frugal among them make to\r\nsave even a farthing!\"\r\n\r\nHad all Pulteney's speech been animated by this spirit he would have\r\nmade out an unanswerable case.  The objection to a salt tax in England\r\nthen was not so great as in India at a later period; but the principle\r\nof the tax was undoubtedly bad, while the general principle of\r\nWalpole's finance was undoubtedly good.  The question, however, was not\r\nargued out by Pulteney or any other speaker on his side upon such a\r\nground as the hardship to the poor man.  The tyranny of an excise\r\nsystem, of any excise system, its unconstitutional, despotic, and\r\ninquisitorial nature--this was the chief ground of attack.  Sir {314}\r\nWilliam Wyndham sounded the alarm which was soon to be followed by a\r\ntremendous echo.  He declared the proposed tax \"not only destructive to\r\nthe trade, but inconsistent with the liberties of this nation.\"  The\r\nvery number of the officers who would have to be appointed to collect\r\nthis one tax, who would be named by the Crown and scattered all over\r\nthe country, would have immense influence on the elections; and this\r\nfact alone would give a power into the hands of the Crown greater than\r\nwas consistent with the liberties of the people, and \"of the most\r\ndangerous consequence to our happy constitution.\"  The Bill passed the\r\nHouse of Commons, and was read a first time in the House of Lords on\r\nMarch 22d.  The second reading was moved on March 27th, and a long\r\ndebate took place.  Not the least interesting fact concerning this\r\ndebate was that the leading part in opposition to the Bill was taken by\r\nLord Carteret, who had returned from his Irish Government, and was\r\nbeginning to show himself a pertinacious and a formidable enemy of\r\nWalpole and his administration.  Carteret outshone even Pulteney and\r\nWyndham in wholesale and extravagant denunciation of the measure.  He\r\nlikened it to the domestic policy of Cardinal Richelieu, by which the\r\nestates of the nobility and gentry were virtually confiscated to the\r\nCrown, and the liberties of the people were lost.  It would place it in\r\nthe power of a wicked administration to reduce the English people to\r\nthe same condition as the people in Turkey; \"their only resource will\r\nbe in mobs and tumults, and the prevailing party will administer\r\njustice by general massacres and proscriptions.\"  All this may now seem\r\nsheer absurdity; but for the purposes of Carteret and Pulteney it was\r\nby no means absurd.  The salt tax was carried through the House of\r\nLords; but the public out-of-doors were taught to believe that the\r\nMinister's financial policy was merely a series of artifices for the\r\ndestruction of popular rights, and for robbing England of her political\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1733--\"A very terrible affair\"]\r\n\r\nWalpole had long had in his mind a measure of a different {315}\r\nnature--a measure to readjust the duties on tobacco and wine.  It was\r\nknown that he was preparing some bill on the subject, and the\r\nexcitement which was beginning to show itself at the time of the salt\r\ntax debates was turned to account by the Opposition to forestall the\r\npopular reception of the expected measure.  The cry was got up that the\r\nadministration were planning a scheme for a general excise, and the\r\nbare idea of a general excise was then odious and terrible to the\r\npublic.  Whatever Walpole's final purposes may have been, there was\r\nnothing to alarm any one in the scheme which he was presently to\r\nintroduce.  Nobody now would think of impugning the soundness of the\r\neconomical principles on which his moderate, limited, and tentative\r\nscheme of fiscal reform was founded.\r\n\r\nThe coming event threw its shadow before it, and the shadow became\r\nmarvellously distorted.  Pulteney, speaking on February 23, 1733, with\r\nregard to the Sinking Fund proposal, talked of the expected excise\r\nscheme in language of such exaggeration that it is impossible to\r\nbelieve the orator could have felt anything like the alarm and horror\r\nhe expressed.  There is \"a very terrible affair impending,\" Pulteney\r\nsaid, \"a monstrous project--yea, more monstrous than has ever yet been\r\nrepresented.  It is such a project as has struck terror into the minds\r\nof most gentlemen within this House, and into the minds of all men\r\nwithout-doors who have any regard to the happiness or to the\r\nconstitution of their country.  I mean that monster the excise; that\r\nplan of arbitrary power which is expected to be laid before this House\r\nin the present session of Parliament.\"  Sir John Barnard, one of the\r\nmembers for the City of London, a man of great respectability,\r\ncapacity, and influence, ventured to predict that Walpole's scheme\r\nwould \"turn out to be his eternal shame and dishonor, and that the more\r\nthe project is examined, and the consequences thereof considered, the\r\nmore the projector will be hated and despised.\"\r\n\r\nOf all this strong language Walpole took little account.  {316} He\r\nmeant to propose his scheme, he said, when the proper time should come,\r\nand he did not doubt but that honorable members would find it something\r\nvery different from the vague and monstrous project of which they had\r\nbeen told.  In any case he meant to propose it.  [Sidenote:\r\n1733--Walpole's scheme] Accordingly, on Wednesday, March 7, 1733,\r\nWalpole moved that the House should on that day week resolve itself\r\ninto a committee \"to consider of the most proper methods for the better\r\nsecurity and improvement of the duties and revenues already charged\r\nupon and payable from tobacco and wines.\"  On the day appointed,\r\nWednesday, March 14th, the House went into committee accordingly, and\r\nWalpole expounded his scheme.  It was simply a plan to deal with the\r\nduties on wines and tobacco, and Walpole protested that his views and\r\npurposes were confined altogether to these two branches of the revenue,\r\nand that such a thing as a scheme for a general excise had never\r\nentered into his head, \"nor, for what I know, into the head of any man\r\nI am acquainted with.\"  There was in the mind of the English people\r\nthen a vague horror of all excise laws and excise officers, and the\r\nwhole opposition to Walpole's scheme in and out of the House of Commons\r\nwas maintained by an appeal to that common feeling.  Walpole's\r\nresolutions with regard to the tobacco trade were taken first and\r\nseparately.  It will soon be seen that the resolutions concerning the\r\nduties on wine were destined never to be discussed at all.  What\r\nWalpole proposed to do in regard to tobacco was to make the customs\r\nduty very small and to increase the excise duty; to establish bonded\r\nwarehouses for the storing of the tobacco imported into this country\r\nand meant to be exported again or sold here for home consumption; thus\r\nto encourage and facilitate the importation; to get rid of many of the\r\ndishonest practices which injured the fair dealer and defrauded the\r\nrevenue; to put a stop to smuggling; to benefit at once the grower, the\r\nmanufacturer, the consumer, and the revenue.  We need not relate at\r\ngreat length and in minute detail the history of these resolutions\r\n{317} and of the debates on them in the House of Commons.  But it may\r\nbe pointed out that, wild and absurd as were the outcries of the\r\nPatriots, there yet was good reason for their apprehension of a growing\r\nscheme to substitute excise for land-tax or poll-tax or customs.\r\nWalpole was, as we know, a firm believer in the advantages of indirect\r\ntaxation, and of the introduction, as freely as possible, of all raw\r\nmaterials for manufacture, and all articles useful for the food of a\r\nnation.  He was a free-trader before his time, and he saw that in\r\ncertain cases there was immense advantage to the consumer and to the\r\nrevenue in allowing articles to be imported under as light a duty as\r\npossible, and then putting an excise duty on their distribution here.\r\nWalpole was perfectly right in all this, but his enemies were none the\r\nless justified in proclaiming that the proposals he was introducing\r\ncould not end in a mere readjustment of the tobacco and wine duties.\r\n\r\nWalpole's first resolution was carried by 206 votes against 205.  The\r\nGovernment had won a victory, but it was such a victory as Walpole did\r\nnot care to win.  He had been used of late to bear down all before him,\r\nand he saw with eyes of clear foreboding the ominous significance of\r\nhis present majority.  He knew well that the Opposition had got the\r\nmost telling cry they could possibly have sought or found against him.\r\nHe knew that popular tumult would grow from day to day.  He knew that\r\nhis enemies were unscrupulous, and that they were banded together\r\nagainst him on many grounds and with many different purposes.  Every\r\nsection of the nation which had any hostile feeling to the House of\r\nHanover, to the existing administration, or to the Prime-minister\r\nhimself, made common cause against, not his Excise Bill, but him.  The\r\ntobacco resolutions were passed, and a bill to put them into execution\r\nwas ordered to be prepared.  On April 4th the Bill was introduced to\r\nthe House of Commons, and a motion was made that it be read a first\r\ntime.  Much, however, had happened out-of-doors since the day when\r\nWalpole introduced his {318} resolutions.  Even at that time there was\r\na great excitement abroad, which, brought crowds of more or less\r\ntumultuous persons round the entrances of the House of Commons.  The\r\ntroops had to be kept in readiness for any emergency that might arise.\r\nThe least thing feared was that they might have to be employed to keep\r\nthe access to the House clear for its members.  [Sidenote: 1733--The\r\nBill abandoned] By the time the first division had taken place, the\r\ntide of popular passion had swollen still higher.  As Walpole was\r\nquitting the House a furious rush was made at him, and but that some of\r\nhis colleagues surrounded, protected, and bore him off, he would have\r\nbeen in serious personal danger.  But the interval between that event\r\nand the introduction of the Bill had been turned to very practical\r\naccount by those who were agitating against him, and the country was\r\nnow in a flame of excitement.  The _Craftsman_ and the pamphleteers had\r\ndone their work well.  The most extravagant consequences were described\r\nas certain to follow from the adoption of Walpole's excise scheme.  A\r\nminister once allowed to impose his excise duty upon wine and tobacco,\r\nand--thus shrieked the mouths of a hundred pamphleteers and\r\nverse-mongers--he will go on imposing excise on every article of food\r\nand dress and household use.  Nothing will be able to resist the\r\ninquisitorial exciseman.  It was positively asserted in ballad and in\r\npamphlet that before long the exciseman would everywhere practise on\r\nthe daughters of England the atrociously insulting test which was\r\nattempted on Wat Tyler's daughter, and which brought about Wat Tyler's\r\ninsurrection.  The memories of Wat Tyler and of Jack Straw were invoked\r\nto arouse popular panic and fury.  Strange as it may now seem, these\r\nappeals were successful in their object; they did create a popular\r\npanic, and stir up popular passion and fury to the uttermost height.\r\nNot even Walpole attempted any longer to argue down the monstrous\r\nmisrepresentations of his policy.  The fury against him and his excise\r\nscheme grew hotter every day, and at one time it was positively thought\r\nthat his life {319} was in danger.  Tumultuous crowds of people\r\ngathered in and around all the approaches to the House of Commons.\r\nSeveral members of the House who were known to be in favor of the\r\nMinisterial scheme complained that they had been menaced, insulted, and\r\neven assaulted; and the House had for the security of its own debates,\r\nand the personal safety of its own members, to pass resolutions\r\ndeclaring that this riotous behavior was destructive of the freedom and\r\nconstitution of Parliament, and a high crime and misdemeanor.  In the\r\nHouse itself certain tactics, with which Parliament has been very\r\nfamiliar at a later period, were tried with some effect.  Various\r\nmotions for adjournment and other such delay to the progress of the\r\nBill were made and pressed to a division.  It was becoming evident to\r\nevery one that the measure was doomed, and the hearts of the leaders of\r\nOpposition rose with each hour that passed, while the spirits of the\r\nMinisterialists fell.\r\n\r\nWalpole never lost his head, although he well knew that a certain and a\r\ndamaging failure was now awaiting him.  He still proclaimed that his\r\nmeasure could be hurtful to none but smugglers and unfair traders, that\r\nit would be of great benefit to the revenue and the nation, that it\r\nwould tend \"to make London a free port, and by consequence the market\r\nof the world.\"  He spoke with scorn of the riotous crowds whom some had\r\ndeclared to be merely respectful petitioners.  \"Gentlemen may give them\r\nwhat name they think fit; it may be said that they came hither as\r\nhumble suppliants, but I know whom the law calls sturdy beggars.\"  The\r\nCommon Council of London, spirited on by a Jacobite Lord Mayor,\r\npetitioned against the excise scheme, and its example was followed by\r\nvarious municipalities in the kingdom.  Walpole acted at last according\r\nto the principle which always governed him at such a crisis.  He had\r\nthe courage to abandon the ground which he had taken up, and which he\r\nwould have been well entitled to maintain if argument could prevail\r\nover misrepresentation and passion.  With that {320} cool contempt for\r\nthe extravagance and the ignorance of the sentiment which thwarted him,\r\nhe abandoned his scheme and let the mob have its way.  On Wednesday,\r\nApril 11, 1733, it was made known that the Government did not intend to\r\ngo any farther with the Bill.  Exultation all over the island was\r\nunbounded.  Church bells rang, windows were illumined, bonfires blazed,\r\nmultitudes shouted everywhere.  If England had gained some splendid\r\nvictory over a combination of foreign enemies, there could not have\r\nbeen a greater display of frantic national enthusiasm than that which\r\nbroke out when it was found that hostile clamor had prevailed against\r\nthe Minister, and that his excise scheme was abandoned.\r\n\r\nFrederick the Great has enriched the curiosities of history with an\r\naccount which he gives of the abandonment of the Bill.  According to\r\nhim, George the Second had devised the measure as a means of making\r\nhimself absolute sovereign of England.  The Excise Bill was intended to\r\nput him in possession of a revenue fixed and assured, a revenue large\r\nenough to allow him to increase his military power to any strength he\r\npleased.  It only needed a word of command and a chief for revolution\r\nto break out.  Walpole escaped from Parliament covered with an old\r\ncloak, and shouting with all his might, \"Liberty, liberty! no excise!\"\r\nThus disguised, he managed to get to the King in St. James's Palace.\r\nHe found the King preparing for the worst, arming himself at all\r\npoints, having put on the hat he wore at Malplaquet, and trying the\r\ntemper of the sword he carried at Oudenarde.  George desired to put\r\nhimself at once at the head of his guards, and try conclusions with his\r\nenemies.  Walpole had all the trouble in the world to moderate his\r\nsovereign's impetuosity, and at length represented to him, \"with the\r\ngenerous hardihood of an Englishman attached to his master,\" that it\r\nwas only a choice between abandoning the Excise Bill and losing the\r\ncrown.  Whereupon George at last gave way; the Bill was abandoned, and\r\nthe crown preserved.\r\n\r\n{321}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1733--Romance and reality]\r\n\r\nThis scene is, of course, a piece of the purest romance.  But it is\r\ncertain that the passions of the people were so thoroughly aroused that\r\na man less cool and in the true sense courageous than Walpole might\r\nhave provoked a popular outbreak, and no one can say whether the crown\r\nof the Brunswicks might not have gone down in a popular outbreak just\r\nthen.  Time and education have long since vindicated Walpole's\r\nfinancial principles; but the passion, the ignorance, and the\r\npartisanship of his own day were too strong, and prevailed against him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF THE FIRST VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{322}\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abernethy, Dr., death, iv. 282.\r\n  Act for better securing the Dependency of Ireland, i. 177.\r\n  Act of Settlement, i. 4.\r\n  Act of Union passed, iii. 327, 330.\r\n  Acts of Trade, iii. 82, 84, 86, 105.\r\n  Adams, John:\r\n    Conduct towards Colonel Preston, iii. 152.\r\n    Opposes dominion of England, iii. 85.\r\n  Adams, Samuel, protests against Stamp Act, iii. 90.\r\n  Addington, Henry, Viscount Sidmouth, Prime Minister, iii. 337.\r\n  Addison, Joseph:\r\n    M.
