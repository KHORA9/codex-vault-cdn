If, for instance, the Moqattam hills behind\r\nthe Citadel be ascended, the lower part of the scarp is found to be\r\ncomposed of white limestone, which is capped by a series of sandy\r\nlimestones and clays differing alike in colour and in the rapidity\r\nwith which they are worn away by the streams, due to the rare but\r\ndestructive winter rains. Finally, the summit is crowned by beds\r\nin which boulders of flint and quartz play the most important part,\r\nthe matrix of sand which bound them together having long been removed\r\nby the action of the wind.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if we were to go southward towards Aswan, a change would\r\nbe noted in the character and composition of the rocks which form\r\nthe cliffs bordering the Nile Valley. From Cairo to Qena, limestones\r\npredominate; but from thence southward to Esna, clays play a large\r\npart at the base of the limestones, and the slipping of the latter\r\nover these softer members has given rise to the “tumbled” country\r\nwhich is so conspicuous a feature between Armant and Matana. South of\r\nEsna the clays in their turn disappear, while the sandstone which is\r\nseen underlying them near Mahamid becomes the dominant constituent\r\nof the hills from near Edfu to the neighbourhood of Aswan; at this\r\nlocality the sandstone itself vanishes, except in so far as it forms\r\nisolated caps on the granite, which is the principal rock in the\r\nwell-known district of the First Cataract.\r\n\r\nThe same lesson as to the order of succession of the rocks in Egypt\r\nis forced home if we move from Qena eastward to the Red Sea hills,\r\nor south-westward to Kharga Oasis. East of Qena the clays are a\r\nconspicuous feature at the base of the outlying limestone hills (Abu\r\nHad, etc.), and in their turn rest on sandstone, which forms striking\r\nplateaus seamed by deep ravines giving entry to the heart of the Red\r\nSea hills. On traversing these gorges, a confused hill-country of\r\ngranite (worn into boulders on the surface), or dark-green schists is\r\nentered, on whose summits the sandstone occurs as isolated outliers\r\nnear the main sandstone mass, but to the east disappears altogether.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, going westward and crossing the great limestone desert, on\r\nreaching the edge of the scarp which bounds the oases, clays appear\r\nfrom under the limestones, and in their turn overlie sandstones\r\nforming the floors of the oasis depressions. Closer examination\r\nreveals the fact that in the upper part of the sandstone series seams\r\nof clay alternate with the sandy layers, and in that part of the cliff\r\nwhere clay bands predominate, beds of limestone alternate with them.\r\n\r\nIn broad outline, it may be stated that in southern Egypt, limestone\r\nrests on clays alternating with limestone, these on sandstones which\r\nin their upper part alternate with clay, and the sandstone on granite\r\nand metamorphic rocks (slates, schists, etc.). The inclination or dip\r\nof the various beds is such that should a boring be made through the\r\nlimestone near Cairo, one might expect to reach first a succession\r\nof beds where clay was predominant, followed by beds of sandstone,\r\nand finally the series of which the granite of Aswan is a conspicuous\r\nmember.[2] In northern Egypt, the conditions are reversed, sandstones\r\nand clays _overlying_ the limestones near Cairo, but never attaining\r\nthe extent and importance of those exposed to view in the south.\r\n\r\nThese facts require an explanation—the one furnished by the science\r\nof Geology, being briefly as follows: Each of the rocks observed\r\nhas a definite origin or formation; the nature of their present\r\ndistribution is due to subsequent movement, or deformation; the\r\nvarious meteorological agencies at work lead to the transformation of\r\nthe original structures, resulting in the formation of a new series\r\nof rocks composed of materials derived from the wearing away of the\r\nolder deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   II.—ORIGIN OR FORMATION OF ROCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe simplest illustration of the formation of a rock is one which\r\nmay be observed by the dweller in Egypt every year during the Nile\r\nflood. The “red water” of the Nile, if collected during this\r\nperiod, and evaporated to dryness, leaves behind it the fine-grained\r\nsediment, or Nile mud, forming the soil to which this land owes its\r\nfertility; while in the central portions of the river, the coarser\r\nmaterial, consisting largely of sand-grains, is being transported by\r\nthe stronger current. As a result, the river flows for the main part\r\nover a sandy bed, the clays being restricted to the sides where the\r\nwater is moving less swiftly, or to the fields on which the finer\r\nsediment is deposited. This “red water” has been traced step by\r\nstep to its parent source, and has been proved to be derived from\r\nthe wearing away of the widely-spread volcanic rocks of Abyssinia,\r\ndisintegrated by differences of temperature, etc., and denuded\r\nby the destructive rainstorms which break over that region in the\r\nearly summer. It is equally a matter of experience that on drying,\r\nthis sediment passes from the condition of a soft and sticky mud\r\nto a hard and resistant clay, which, drying during the heat of the\r\nsummer, cracks in every direction. The fluviatile character of these\r\nclay deposits is often revealed by the presence of the river shells\r\nenclosed in them, and in each succeeding year slight differences\r\nin composition in the material brought down are indicated by the\r\nlayers being sharply marked off from one another, and so presenting\r\nthe familiar stratified appearance. Again, much sand and clay is\r\nbeing carried seaward and deposited, the former, in general, nearer\r\nthe land on account of its greater specific gravity and less finely\r\ndivided character.\r\n\r\nThese clays and sands are forming both on the land and in the sea,\r\na point which does not need elaboration, but when considering the\r\norigin of the limestones, and how it is that they seem at times to\r\nbe built up of fossil shells, as a rule the general student would\r\nbe at a loss for an answer. The researches in the great oceans,\r\nwhich have been carried on with such assiduity during recent years,\r\nhave shown that the upper layers of their waters are crowded with a\r\nvast number of living organisms, apparently simple in structure, but\r\nhaving the power of extracting the carbonate of lime in solution and\r\nconstructing shells of complicated and beautiful form. As the animals\r\ndie, these tiny shells rain down to the bed of the ocean, slowly\r\nforming a muddy white calcareous paste which encloses the sea-urchins\r\nand other marine animals living in the depths of the sea. Thus, step\r\nby step, muds (which on drying are as genuine limestones as any now\r\nforming the cliffs and scarps of Egypt) are laid down on one another,\r\nseparated into strata whenever some external change, such as the\r\naddition of some clayey matter transported from a river in flood,\r\nslightly alters the composition. The alteration is subsequently\r\nindicated either by variation in tint or by differing resistance\r\nto the wearing influences of the meteorological agencies. But how\r\nare these argillaceous muds transformed into the solid clays, the\r\nsands into sandstones, and the calcareous muds into fossiliferous\r\nlimestones? How have these loose materials become consolidated so\r\nas to form the compact rock-masses with which we become acquainted\r\nin the most casual study of the physical structure of Egypt?\r\n\r\n\r\n                      III.—DEFORMATION OF ROCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nExamination of the rock exposures at many localities in the\r\nneighbourhood of Cairo bears witness to the fact that the strata of\r\nlimestone which were laid down horizontally upon the bed of the sea\r\nare no longer in the position they once occupied, but are now inclined\r\nto the horizontal plane at angles which are easily perceptible. This\r\nis especially noticeable in the two shallow cuttings under the\r\nGreat Pyramid, where the strata are inclined 5 degrees to the\r\nsouth, revealing the reason why the whole Pyramid slope descends so\r\nrapidly in the southward direction. Again, if standing at the base\r\nof the same mighty structure, the gaze be allowed to wander over\r\nthe broad expanse of the Nile Valley to the scarp of the Moqattam\r\nhills behind the Citadel, it will be seen that the white limestone\r\nof their lower slopes forms, not a long horizontal wall, but an arch,\r\nsloping strongly both north and south of the Citadel. There has been\r\nobviously change of form, but how has it taken place?\r\n\r\nWe learn with surprise that an earthquake shock in distant San\r\nFrancisco or in the inhospitable regions of Turkestan has recorded\r\nitself through the delicately-poised recorder at Helwan, long before\r\nthe dire news of destruction has flashed along the telegraph wire\r\nto the same destination. There is a realization of the instability\r\nof the earth’s crust, in spite of the solidarity of its component\r\nparts, but though the sudden shocks bring home this truth, it is\r\nnot so readily grasped that day by day and hour by hour parts of the\r\nearth’s crust are slowly rising and others sinking, offering stern\r\nproblems to the dwellers on the shores where these changes are most\r\nmarkedly taking place. On the eastern shores of England, towns and\r\nforests are being submerged beneath the relentless advance of the sea;\r\non the coasts of the Scandinavian peninsula, etc., on the other hand,\r\nbeaches formerly beneath the sea now stand high above the influence of\r\nits waves, and in Egypt coral-reefs which once grew beneath the waters\r\nof the Red Sea rise in places to over two hundred metres above it in\r\nbold hills or steep-sided terraces. Though possibly of far greater\r\nimportance and significance than the sudden convulsions which have\r\nleft so deep an impression on the mind of man, these movements are\r\nnevertheless so imperceptible that they arouse little attention.\r\n\r\nA second type of deformation is noted where heavy masses of one\r\nrock rest on other and softer materials. The underlying beds are\r\nthen often compressed and contorted; clays, for instance, are\r\ndrawn out into thinner laminæ, giving rise to shales, while the\r\nmassive rocks above either slip on the surface of the lower ones,\r\nif these be impermeable, and so permit of a water-layer forming\r\nalong the junction, or else descend by sheer weight, producing a\r\nconfused area of mixed materials in front of the still unshattered\r\ncliffs. Examples of this nature abound in Egypt wherever the Eocene\r\nlimestones rest on the Cretaceous clays; on the railway from Armant\r\nto Matana the resulting effects are well observed near Shagab. Here\r\nin the main cliff the massive limestones are seen resting on the\r\nsoft bluish clays, while in front is a wilderness of low hills in\r\nwhich limestones and clays are mixed, broken and contorted. But while\r\nthese deformations may be irregular and local, there remain greater\r\npressure-effects which have been regional in character, and by whose\r\nagency the solid rocks have been folded in the most remarkable manner,\r\nstrata once horizontal being thrown into arches, or anticlines,\r\nand basin-like curves, or synclines. The importance of these changes\r\ncannot be over-estimated, and some of the marked features of Egyptian\r\nscenery depend directly on these effects. Reference has already been\r\nmade to the slope of the Pyramid plateau, but the character of Egypt\r\nin far broader outline depends on the results of these pressures and\r\nthe foldings so produced. A glance at the map suffices to show that\r\nmany of the salient features in this country present a remarkable\r\nsimilarity and parallelism. The eastern cliff-wall of Kharga Oasis\r\npreserves a notable parallelism to a portion of the Nile Valley,\r\nthough the latter be separated by many kilometres of wild desert\r\nplateau from the oasis; another portion of the Nile Valley also\r\nagrees with the Gulf of Suez in the broad outlines of its trend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.—Two Anticlines and a Syncline.[3]]\r\n\r\nA section taken from Baharia or Kharga Oasis to the shores of the\r\nRed Sea reveals the fact that Egypt proper is bounded on the west\r\nby a low flat arch which has brought the underlying sandstones\r\nnearer to the surface, giving rise to the great oases.[4] These\r\nare mainly present in the sandstone areas, and are in part bounded\r\nby cliff-walls composed in many instances of clays at the base and\r\nlimestones at the summit. To the east, on the other hand, rise the\r\nRed Sea hills, the central core of a steeply inclined arch in which\r\nthe resistant granites and schists now rise high above the low-lying\r\nsandstone country which flanks them. Between these two arches is\r\nthe flat-bedded syncline in which the nummulitic limestone is the\r\nconspicuous member, the strata in central Egypt having in consequence\r\na half cup-shaped form, of which one half, the northern, may have\r\ndisappeared by fracture beneath the waters of the Mediterranean\r\nSea. This cup-like structure may be due to Egypt having not only\r\nbeen folded in a north-west and south-east direction but also almost\r\nat right angles, this latter folding giving rise to such remarkable\r\nfeatures as the Wadi Araba, the Qena bend, and possibly affording the\r\nfundamental explanation for the great S-shaped bends of the Nile. In\r\nother and more mountainous regions, such as the Alps and Himalayas,\r\nthese solid earth-waves may be under such immense pressure that their\r\ncrests begin first to turn over like those of an advancing wave of\r\nthe sea, and then may be broken in such a way that mighty masses\r\nof strata are rent asunder, those portions which are uppermost\r\nbeing thrust for great distances over the underlying beds. These\r\nextreme folds ending in fracture, or overthrusts, are as yet but\r\nlittle known in Egypt, though Dr. Ball has reported an interesting\r\ncase from the neighbourhood of Abu Harba, and some of the phenomena\r\nof dislocation observed near the borders of the Gulf of Suez may\r\npossibly be explained as resulting from movements of this nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.—Overfolding of Strata.]\r\n\r\nThese intense movements become masked under the influence of the\r\ndenuding hand of time, the contorted strata may again sink beneath the\r\nsea, new beds are laid down horizontally on the upturned edges of the\r\nolder series and the result is the production of an unconformity\r\nbetween the two members, which differ in age, in inclination,\r\nand in fossil character. Sometimes rolled fragments of the older\r\nstratum are interposed between it and the new overlying beds, further\r\nrevealing the activity of denudation before the newer member began\r\nto be deposited.\r\n\r\nIf fracture by overthrust be unknown in Egypt, another type of\r\nfracture has produced effects of a far-reaching character. In certain\r\nregions of the earth, folding is no longer the conspicuous method\r\nby which the rock-components of its crust are displaced with regard\r\nto one another. In many instances small fissures have been observed\r\nin which the beds on one side have been thrown down to a lower level\r\nthan they are on the other. These faults are frequently the result of\r\ngreat earthquakes, many striking examples of such occurrences having\r\nbeen noted during the major earth-movements within the last hundred\r\nyears. It is probable, indeed, that many of the most important of\r\nthese, such as the destructive earthquake of Messina, are due to\r\nfurther settling of the strata in relation to fracture-lines already\r\ndetermined. Naturally, this implies that there are certain spaces\r\nformed deep beneath the earth’s surface, which permit of these\r\nefforts to restrengthen the weak spots by filling up the gaps. In the\r\nextreme outskirts of Egypt these fault-lines have produced marvellous\r\nand striking effects, the most conspicuous being the remarkable\r\ndepression which, commencing at the Gulf of Aqaba, penetrates far\r\ninto the continent of Asia, giving rise to the Dead Sea (many hundred\r\nmetres below the level of the Mediterranean), to the Jordan Valley,\r\nto the Lake of Tiberias, and the valley which continues this line\r\nnorthward. I have had the opportunity of personally studying some\r\nof these fault-lines in the Sinai peninsula, tracing them from an\r\narched fold in the north, whose sides were being let down by faults\r\nin a series of steps, to a trough-fault, in which the younger strata\r\nare displaced bodily between the older ones. Where undisturbed, the\r\nsuccession in Sinai shows sandstone lying on granite, and limestone\r\n(containing definite groups of fossils) on sandstone. In the valleys\r\ndue to these trough-faults, the granite hills tower 500 metres on each\r\nside, capped by small outlying fragments of the overlying sandstone,\r\nwhereas in the valley itself the only rocks visible are limestones\r\nand sandstones often tilted at high angles, and thus revealing the\r\ntremendous displacement to which they have been subjected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.—Unconformity exhibited in the Fayûm.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 4.—Fault exhibited by a Coal-seam.]\r\n\r\nConsidering the earth-movements of Egypt as a whole, the evidence\r\nshows folding to have been the more important type of displacement on\r\nits western side, and intense faulting to have been most conspicuous\r\nin the east, while between these two extremes, the relative importance\r\nof folding and faulting will remain a contested point. The discussion\r\nwill only close when the borders of the Nile Valley and the Gulf\r\nof Suez have been mapped with the accuracy and precision of a\r\nGeological Survey in Europe—a pious aspiration, whose realization\r\ncan scarcely be hoped for while the broad geological picture is\r\nstill being filled in.\r\n\r\nEgypt, then, has passed through a long history, of which the\r\nfollowing seems to be the record put in dogmatic form. The ancient\r\nschists and granites which form the central core of its eastern\r\narch, or anticline, the Red Sea hills, are witnesses to a period\r\nof sedimentation, of volcanic action, and of the influence of\r\ndeep-seated molten igneous masses. Step by step these were revealed\r\nby denudation, becoming part of an ancient continent. In addition to\r\na brief marine invasion during the Carboniferous period, there was a\r\nsecond advance of the sea in Cretaceous times, which is represented\r\nfirst by the deposit of such coarse detrital materials as the sands\r\ncomposing the Nubian sandstones. Then, as the depression increased,\r\nonly the finer clayey materials reached the Egyptian region, and\r\nfinally the sea covered, if not the whole, at least the greater\r\npart of its area for a lengthened period. With the close of the\r\nEocene epoch a reverse movement set in, by which the pure white\r\nmarine limestones of the Moqattam hills were capped by the sandy\r\nlimestones and clays forming the brown-tinted beds of their upper\r\nportion, the whole being, in its turn, covered by the coarse flint\r\nand quartz gravel which containing silicified trees[5] is the chief\r\ndesert-former in the immediate neighbourhood of Cairo, as also of\r\na large area in north-west Egypt. Any gain by the sea since this\r\nperiod has been comparatively local and limited, and the present\r\nconditions suggest that the land is gaining on the sea rather than\r\nthe reverse. The great fold-movements which we have seen to determine\r\nso many important features are relatively of very late date in this\r\nseries of events, on their nature and position depending the present\r\ncharacter and visible extent of the different formations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 IV.—PHYSICAL TRANSFORMATION OF ROCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe geological features of Egypt as presented to-day are the results\r\nof the formation through varying conditions and the subsequent\r\ndeformation of the rocks composing its solid crust; we may next\r\nconsider the varied agencies through whose action these are now\r\nundergoing transformation. A comparatively small portion of this\r\ncountry is undergoing erosion by the sea, and if elevation be still\r\ntaking place, there is rather gain from the sea than destruction\r\nby it.\r\n\r\nVery different, however, are the meteorological agencies which are\r\nat work fashioning the land as a whole, the effects of wind-blown\r\nsand, rain, and river being of prime importance. Different in these\r\nrespects are the Eastern and Western Deserts of Egypt. If the western\r\nborder of the river be examined in Southern Egypt, and especially in\r\nNubia, the sight of huge masses of golden-tinted sand filling every\r\nwind-sheltered hollow might well leave the impression that the vast\r\ndesert plain behind was covered by a pall of sand. Closer study\r\nhas shown that these wind-swept expanses afford no protection or\r\nresting-place for the finer sands and that consequently their floor\r\nmust be formed of the more solid materials which wind cannot carry\r\nbefore it. If this be realized, no astonishment will be felt that\r\nthe Libyan Desert surface is composed of limestone, or of coarse\r\ngravels from between whose larger fragments all the finer sand has\r\nbeen swept away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.—Sand-erosion of Sandstone Cliff at Gebel\r\nel Tunb. Wadi Qena, Eastern Desert.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.—Amphitheatre in Side-valley of Um Leseifa,\r\nnorth-east of Qena, due to erosion of Limestone by the action of\r\nTemporary Torrents.]\r\n\r\n                                                       [Facing p. 10.]\r\n\r\nHowever, the wind-borne sand leaves its mark on the limestones,\r\nwhich in some places are seamed by delicate grooves parallel to\r\nthe sand-blast, and in others, where they are softer, have been\r\nsculptured into low hummocks often scattered over immense tracts\r\nof country. The sand itself has a strangely local distribution,\r\nadvancing across the desert in lines of enormous length, and usually\r\ntrending in an almost meridional direction. The supply does not come\r\nfrom the south or south-west, as might at first sight be expected,\r\nbut from the north, and most of the great dune-systems, which occur\r\naround and beyond the great oases, have their termination in the\r\nsouthern direction. Even the series of dunes, over 100 metres high,\r\nwhich prevented the Rohlfs party advancing westward from Dakhla to\r\nKufra, come to an end further to the south, leaving the wide sandstone\r\nplains bare.[6] In the oasis of Kharga the dominant longitudinal type\r\nis replaced by huge crescentic dunes which, separated by broad spaces\r\nclear of sand, follow one another along a north-south line, and are\r\nnot stopped in their onward march even by ridges of considerable\r\nsize. The reasons have still to be found for these lines of special\r\nsand aggregation, though when studying the cataract district of Amara,\r\nthe initial formation of a dune-system was seen to be determined by\r\na local depression, which had given sufficient protection for the\r\nformation of a sandy base on which the dune could then be built up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Denudation Effects in a District of Sedimentary Rocks.\r\n\r\nFig. 7.—Um Leseifa camp (looking west). The harder beds of limestone\r\nform precipitous ledges.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Denudation Effects in a District of Igneous Rocks.\r\n\r\nFig. 8.—View of Diorite Hills near Gebel Sobeir, Eastern Desert\r\nof Egypt.]\r\n\r\n                                                       [Facing p. 11.]\r\n\r\nNot only are limestones grooved and seamed, but certain areas of\r\nthe Western Desert are covered with curious melon-shaped masses,\r\nharder concretionary portions remaining after the softer materials\r\nof the beds have been carried away by wind-action, whereas in the\r\nregion to the east of the Nile these concretions are still enclosed\r\nin the softer limestones.\r\n\r\nStill more striking is the effect of the wind-blown sand in the\r\nsandstone and granitic regions. Here the complex composition of\r\nthe granite has made it a ready victim. The softer felspars and mica\r\nhaving been worn by the impact, leave the quartz grains loose upon the\r\nsurface, and give the rock a “frittered” appearance. Holes have\r\nbeen formed in the windward side of the blocks, and the sand contained\r\nin them clearly shows the agency to which they owe their origin.\r\n\r\nNear the eastern edge of the Western Desert the effects of\r\nwater-action become more conspicuous, on the borders of the Fayûm\r\nterrace-formation being a marked feature, and there is a transition\r\nto the dominant characteristics which mark the limestone country\r\neastward of the Nile. Here, deep and intricate valley-systems have\r\nbeen cut out from a plateau which a few kilometres from the Nile\r\nis as flat as the great western plains. One of the best known\r\nexamples is the Wadi Hof, near Helwan, with its ramifications,\r\nterminating in steep cliff-faces having all the appearances of “dry\r\nwaterfalls.” Any doubt as to the active agent in their production\r\nis set at rest by an examination of the excellent photographs taken\r\nby various observers during the great storms which almost annually\r\nburst over this region. (The lecture was illustrated by a series of\r\nslides showing Wadi Hof in flood, and the cascades descending the\r\n“waterfalls” which terminate its side-channels, these being most\r\nkindly lent to the writer by Herr Züst, of the Electrical Service,\r\nMinistry of Public Works). The great annual and diurnal temperature\r\nvariations (over 50° C.) aid in the work of denudation by preparing\r\nan immense amount of broken material through the contraction and\r\nexpansion which they produce. As every material expands and contracts\r\naccording as it is heated or cooled, so the different component\r\nparts of the rocks composing the earth’s crust are in constant\r\nmovement with regard to one another, and the less homogeneous they\r\nare the greater the effect in breaking them up into small masses or\r\nparticles. These loosened fragments which cover the surface of the\r\ndesert are thus ready to be swept away by the rain-waters, and as we\r\nhave already seen, it is owing to these effects, superadded to more\r\nsubtle changes next to be considered, that the old volcanic rocks\r\nof Abyssinia yield the rich silt or mud of the Nile Valley. It would\r\nbe difficult to estimate the rapidity with which these wild ravines\r\nare being deepened by any comparison with water-wearing effects in\r\nEurope. Any beds of soft sands and clays are rapidly dissected by\r\nthe torrent waters, a feature which readily explains the absence\r\nof conspicuous hills in the Eastern Desert east of Esna, where the\r\nCretaceous clays form the dominant constituent in the geological\r\nstructure of the country. Whatever the effects of sand-erosion in the\r\nWestern Desert or rain-erosion in the hills and on the plateaus of\r\nthe Eastern Desert of Egypt, they come relatively but little under\r\nthe notice of the dweller on the Nile, to whom the river-erosion\r\nand the reformation of new materials become of primary importance.\r\n\r\nEven the powerful agency of frost cannot be entirely dismissed from\r\nconsideration in Egypt. Owing to the expansion of water when converted\r\ninto ice, the rocks in whose cracks the water has collected are split\r\nasunder, and as we have recently noted, temperatures lower than 2°\r\nC. have been recorded in Cairo during the present winter (1910). On\r\nthe great desert plateau which extends from Kharga Oasis to the Nile\r\nValley, temperatures of 24° F. and 30° F. were also observed, and\r\nin the Red Sea hills and Sinai frost must be of common occurrence,\r\nas one mountain in the latter peninsula was ascended in snow, and\r\nthe higher peaks are frequently covered in a white pall.\r\n\r\nThe nature of a river system need not be dealt with in much detail\r\nhere, as I have already discussed this subject in “Survey Notes”\r\nfor April, 1907, under the title of “River Characteristics as\r\nillustrated by the Nile.” It may be well, however, to recall that a\r\nnormal river passes through three distinct phases of activity. In its\r\nmountain tract (for most large rivers arise in the higher altitudes)\r\nthere is maximum erosion and backward growth of the river system. In\r\nits central portion, or valley tract, the stream is acting as a\r\ntransporter of eroded material, and such erosion as there is, is\r\ndownward rather than sideward. Finally, the plain tract is the region\r\nof deposition of the materials so carried, erosion being lateral,\r\nand the growth of the stream bed forward in the form of a fan-shaped\r\ndelta where the transported sands and clays enter the sea.\r\n\r\nBut this general succession may be further complicated by\r\ncircumstances depending upon the geological conditions. In Egypt and\r\nthe Sudan the Nile passes from areas where it flows peacefully and\r\nquietly, usually of considerable breadth and bounded by fertile lands,\r\nto others in which it is restricted, dashing down steep slopes in\r\nrapids and cataracts. A geological examination has shown that in\r\nthe first case the river is flowing over and between sedimentary\r\nhomogeneous rocks, such as the limestones and sandstones, while in\r\nthe second instance it has entered regions composed of heterogeneous\r\nigneous and metamorphic rocks, such as the granites, gneisses and\r\nschists. The production of these rapids is due to the combination of\r\nsteep slope and the difference between harder and softer materials,\r\nthe rapidly-moving waters wearing away those more easily denuded,\r\nwhile the compact members remain as obstacles to their advance,\r\nand are only slowly worn away along joint-planes and other lines of\r\nweakness. In the Third Cataract, hard bars of granite rising through\r\nsofter gneiss at right angles to the river course have produced the\r\nmain rapids; elsewhere, as at the Bab el Kebir, near Wadi Halfa, the\r\nriver has taken advantage of a thin dyke of soft rock traversing an\r\nextremely hard diorite, so that the stream has worn a narrow gully\r\nbetween steep rock-walls, where the intensity of the rush of water\r\nis greatly exaggerated owing to its being restrained and fettered\r\nby the narrowness of the passage. In some cases the same result has\r\nbeen produced owing to the existence of a line of fracture, or fault,\r\nacross the stream, the waters taking advantage of this line of least\r\nresistance. The general erosion in these rapids is accompanied\r\nby great local effects where eddies and whirlpools are produced,\r\nand the sand and rocky fragments act as abrading agents. Pot-holes\r\nare formed in the solid rock, and rapidly deepened by the intense\r\neffects of this nature produced during times of flood, the result\r\nbeing splendidly illustrated in some of the smaller islands of the\r\nFirst Cataract at Aswan.\r\n\r\nA river is, in fact, the main agent combining the effects of\r\ntransformation and reformation, new strata being produced in its\r\nplain tract as the result of the eroding activities in its upper\r\nreaches. Much of the detrital material is also carried seaward to\r\nform deposits of marine sands and muds along the shore-lines of the\r\ncontinents, these themselves becoming, should subsequent differential\r\nmovement of land and sea take place, the sandstones and clays of\r\nfuture continental areas.\r\n\r\nBut there are other agencies at work as transformers on and within\r\nthe earth’s crust. There are in most rocks a series of divisional\r\nplanes, which may be either vertical or inclined, and to which\r\nthe name of joints has been given. These may arise from various\r\ncauses. Both in sedimentary and igneous rocks they are in part\r\ndue to contraction during consolidation—in the former when they\r\nlose their contained water, in the latter when they solidify from a\r\nmolten condition. Joints may also be called into being by the effects\r\nof internal pressures and movements within the earth’s crust,\r\nsuch structures having been experimentally reproduced by Daubrée\r\nin materials under stress by torsion and by simple pressure. The\r\ngranite of Aswan displays such jointing to a marked degree, giving\r\nrise to remarkable hills composed of huge boulders of granite piled\r\non one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 V.—CHEMICAL TRANSFORMATION OF ROCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides the mechanical effects of river, rain, and wind, other changes\r\nwhose wide-reaching significance cannot be over-estimated, are taking\r\nplace on and below the earth’s surface. Chemical action is slowly\r\nat work producing effects of the first importance to man. Rain-water\r\nhas the power of absorbing important quantities of carbonic acid\r\ngas and oxygen from the atmosphere. On the average, rain-water\r\ncontains 1·77 per cent by volume of dissolved carbonic acid gas,\r\nand 33·76 per cent of dissolved oxygen. In passing through the soil,\r\nrain-water also absorbs the organic acids formed by the decomposition\r\nof plant remains. These dissolved gases and organic acids render rain\r\nan active chemical agent in the alteration of rocks, its effects\r\nbeing conveniently classified under the headings: (1) Oxidation;\r\n(2) Solution; (3) Formation of Carbonates; and (4) Hydration.\r\n\r\n(1) Oxidation results in the formation of thin crusts on the\r\nsurface of rocks, the compounds of manganese and iron so frequently\r\npresent in them being also rusted or hydrated by the action of the\r\nrain-water. Nothing is more striking than the presence of the dark\r\nfilms on the desert limestones in regions which are liable to a\r\ncertain amount of rainfall, and nothing more convincing as to their\r\norigin than their absence in those portions of the south-western\r\ndesert of Egypt where rain is of great rarity. Near the Nile, the Red\r\nSea and the Mediterranean, dew may take the part of rain in action,\r\nand in a sense the results of its activity may appear more intense,\r\nas rain is liable to wash away the products of its own handiwork.\r\n\r\n(2) The effects of Solution are of the greatest importance,\r\nlimestone being soluble to the extent of about 1 part in 1,000 in\r\nwater saturated with carbonic acid. In many limestone countries of the\r\nworld the solution effects are marked by the production of underground\r\ncaves and channels and in some parts of the north-eastern desert of\r\nEgypt, where chalky limestones are the main constituent, this action\r\nhas produced remarkable results—large caves, cylindrical channels,\r\nand natural bridges being of not uncommon occurrence.\r\n\r\n(3) Formation of Carbonates. Owing to the rains in Egypt being of very\r\nbrief duration, but nevertheless extremely active while they last,\r\nthe soluble material in the condition of the unstable bicarbonate\r\nof lime is carried only a short distance, and losing its loosely\r\ncombined carbonic acid is redeposited in the cracks of the rocks,\r\nas veins of carbonate of lime, or as the cementing material by\r\nwhich broken fragments are consolidated into compact breccias. This\r\naction may be seen in the cliff face south of the Pyramids, near the\r\nSphinx, where the sandy limestones forming the top of the hill have\r\nbeen attached by the rain containing carbonic acid. The calcareous\r\ntests of the shells in the sandy limestones have been dissolved away,\r\nleaving only the sandy internal casts of the shells behind, and the\r\nmaterial so removed has been redeposited in intricate interlacing\r\nveins in a clayey band immediately below. A vein may sometimes grow\r\nby the accretion of successive layers, which, owing to local causes,\r\nsuch as the relative content of iron oxide, etc., may display slightly\r\ndifferent colours, one of the results being the production of so\r\ninteresting a rock as the Egyptian alabaster, which is a carbonate\r\nof lime. As a rule, the term alabaster is applied to the sulphate\r\nrather than to the carbonate of lime. Probably much carbonate of\r\nlime is also carried in solution to the sea, and there forms the\r\nsource of the material which hundreds of living animals seize upon\r\nfor the production of the shells in which they dwell. I was much\r\nstruck last year, during a journey from the Pyramids to Wasta, to\r\nnote how the oyster-beds of one age (the Pliocene) formed themselves\r\nupon oyster-beds of a long preceding period (the Eocene), probably\r\non account of the greater amount of carbonate of lime at those\r\nlocalities, present owing to solution of the earlier shell-structures.\r\n\r\nThat veins of carbonate of lime should be present in limestone\r\ndistricts is, in view of the above statements, not surprising,\r\nbut it does appear somewhat startling at first sight, to find\r\nmarked deposits of carbonate of lime lining the floors and sides of\r\ntorrent-beds in districts entirely composed of igneous or volcanic\r\nrocks of complicated mineral structure. Experience has shown,\r\nhowever, that the lime silicates, so abundant in the more basic\r\nmembers of the igneous series, such as diabases and diorites, are\r\nliable to the attack of the rain-waters containing carbonic acid,\r\ncarbonate of lime being produced by the reaction.\r\n\r\n(4) Of the results of Hydration, the most striking examples in Egypt\r\nare the formation of kaolin near Aswan, due to the absorption of water\r\nby the felspars of the granitic and gneissose rocks, and the thick\r\nzone of decomposition (kaolinic) products, which was cut through in\r\nexcavating the navigation canal in the syenite which forms the main\r\nrock at that locality.\r\n\r\nThe total effect of all the above-mentioned meteorological influences\r\nresults in the weathering of the rock-surface, involving the softening\r\nand crumbling of the harder materials, but sometimes leading to\r\nthe solidification of materials previously loosely aggregated by\r\nsubstances left as cementing agents when the water containing them\r\nin solution has evaporated.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the various direct results of the meteorological\r\nactivities upon the earth’s surface, there are others which\r\nindicate more subtle changes. Perhaps amongst the most interesting\r\nof these is the formation of concretions—bodies composed of one\r\nmaterial aggregated in more or less rounded or irregular form in a\r\nrock of another composition. Among the most interesting and abundant\r\nof these are the layers of flint, which form bands of strikingly\r\nparallel character in the limestones of Upper Egypt. These have not\r\nyet been submitted to the detailed study which similar concretions\r\nhave received in Europe, but there is little doubt that they,\r\nin large measure, represent the aggregation of gelatinous silica\r\nround decomposing organic materials, the shells of organisms and the\r\nframework of siliceous sponges often forming their centre. In some\r\ncases, as in the fossil trees, the replacement appears to have taken\r\nplace molecule by molecule, as the outlines of every cell of the once\r\nwoody fibre are now replaced in silica. By a well-known transition,\r\nthis once gelatinous material has now become one of the most solid\r\nof substances.\r\n\r\nFerruginous concretions, composed of oxide of iron, are present in\r\nmany of the Egyptian sandy clays, some of the beautifully-tinted\r\npurple, yellow and red ochres being found in this form; and\r\nthe natives collect them for the use of the women as ornamental\r\ncoloration.\r\n\r\nOf greater importance to the world at large are the gradual changes\r\nwhich vegetable matter (collected under specially favourable\r\ncircumstances free of all sandy and clayey admixture) has undergone\r\nthrough vast periods of time, causing the slow evolution of the\r\noxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen, originally present, with a gradual\r\npredominance of the carbon. This passage from vegetable matter to coal\r\nhas been noted in Egypt in connection with the Nubian sandstone,\r\nbeds of carbonaceous material deserving the name of lignite or\r\neven bituminous coal having been found at various localities. The\r\ndeposits found up to the present time are of such tenuity that it\r\nis not possible on the evidence available to express optimistic\r\nopinions as to the probable occurrence of workable coal in Egypt,\r\nbut still they are of sufficient interest to be kept constantly in\r\nmind while the Geological Survey is prosecuting its researches. From\r\ntime to time the finding of coal-seams has been reported at Edfu,\r\nin Kharga, at Saqiet el Teir and Abu Radham[7] in the Eastern Desert,\r\nbut the efforts hitherto made have resulted in failure.\r\n\r\nThe evidence thus far available shows that great rivers were entering\r\nthe sea in Nubia during an early geological period (the Cretaceous),\r\ntypical fresh-water shells having been found south of Aswan covered\r\nwith marine worm-tubes; leaf-imprints are abundant in some of\r\nthe sandy layers, and in isolated instances they have collected\r\nin sufficient quantity to give rise to lignite and bituminous\r\ncoal-layers of extreme thinness, showing that this interesting\r\nand important change has taken place, at least to some extent,\r\nin Egypt itself. The study of coal-producing regions tends to show\r\nthat the change to coal of high commercial value requires not only\r\nconditions favourable to the loss of the more volatile gases, but\r\nalso that the beds must have been involved in great earth-movements,\r\nwhich have hastened the tendency to their being enriched in carbon,\r\nboth favourable conditions of deposition and marked disturbance of\r\nthe strata being thus required to obtain the much-desired result.\r\n\r\nOther internal chemical activities are at work, producing changes\r\nwhich are still the cause of debate and earnest study. The origin of\r\npetroleum must undoubtedly be traced to chemical transformations of a\r\ncomplicated character, if we may judge by the number of experimental\r\nmethods which yield petroleum as a product. All opinions agree that\r\nthe mineral oil is derived by some form of chemical action, though\r\nwhether it arises from the decomposition of organic remains or whether\r\nit be of inorganic origin is still matter of dispute. Geological\r\nstudents have on the whole ranged themselves on the side of the\r\nfirst-named view, pointing out that the petroleum fields are all\r\nassociated with sedimentary strata, whether sands or limestones. The\r\ninorganic view has been held as tenaciously by a number of men\r\nexperienced in the search for oil, and it is capable of argument\r\nthat sulphur dioxide and sulphuretted hydrogen, if being produced\r\nsimultaneously, may result in the alteration of limestone to gypsum,\r\nfree sulphur and petroleum being also obtained in the reaction.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is interesting to note that gypsum, sulphur\r\nand petroleum are associated at Jemsa, on the Gulf of Suez.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting features in connection with petroleum is\r\nthe phenomenon presented in most oil-fields of oil-wells separated\r\nperhaps by only thirty metres emitting oil under pressure at the\r\nsame time; also the great pressures indicated by the remarkable\r\nfountain flows which are of constant occurrence in the principal\r\npetroleum fields.[8]\r\n\r\n\r\n                  VI.—THE FORMATION OF IGNEOUS ROCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe external and internal transforming agents are therefore of\r\nthe deepest interest and of the highest economic importance,\r\nand the further study of the deep-seated changes leads directly\r\nto a consideration of the formation and sustained activity of the\r\nmolten materials which find their main present-day expression in the\r\nphenomena of volcanoes. Their extension in the past is also revealed\r\nby the wearing hand of time in the wide distribution of coarsely\r\ncrystalline granites and other igneous rocks, once deep-seated,\r\nbut now exposed in regions which are either the cores of ancient\r\ncontinents or centres of exceptional deformation.\r\n\r\nIgneous action and movements of the earth’s crust stand in intimate\r\nrelation to one another, a point which has been clearly stated by\r\nDr. Harker[9] as follows:—“Setting aside operations conducted in\r\nhypothetical intercrustal magma-basins, or generally in the unknown\r\ndepths of the earth’s crust, we recognize the actual manifestations\r\nof igneous action chiefly in the forcing outward of molten magmas from\r\na lower to a higher level within the crust or through the crust to the\r\nsurface.” This study has led directly to the recognition of three\r\nphases of igneous action, of which two are intrusive, being phases in\r\nwhich the molten materials are raised from a lower to a higher level\r\nwithin the earth’s crust, and an extrusive phase, in which these\r\nmaterials are raised to the surface and poured out there as lavas.\r\n\r\nStudy in all parts of the world has further shown that these events\r\nfollow a definite sequence or cycle of igneous activity, volcanic\r\nphenomena marking its commencement, followed by the movement of\r\ndeep-seated igneous molten magmas (representing the plutonic phase),\r\nand closing with a number of minor intrusions, which may seam both the\r\nvolcanic, plutonic, and sedimentary strata. Egypt clearly illustrates\r\nthis remarkable succession, and thus gives additional grounds for\r\nbelieving that it is of fundamental importance. Volcanic activity\r\nwas developed on a gigantic scale when the most ancient sediments\r\nof Egypt, now forming the folded and altered slates and schists\r\nof the Red Sea hills, were being laid down. To this part of the\r\ncycle belong some of the most interesting rocks of the country,\r\nthe imperial porphyry of Dokhan, the dark andesites that crown\r\nthe highest summits in Sinai, and the country-rock in which some\r\nof the most ancient of Egypt’s gold-mines are situated. Here,\r\ntoo, belong the banded and columnar lavas of the Sixth Cataract,\r\nand the fragments of volcanic rocks which play an important part in\r\nthe characteristic conglomerates of the Eastern Desert.\r\n\r\nStill more conspicuous is the phase of plutonic activity, vast\r\nmasses of granite, diorite, and other highly crystalline rocks\r\nas molten magmas having been in contact with or intruded into the\r\noverlying sediments and volcanic materials. From Sinai to the Sudan\r\nthere is a geographical complex due to the intermingling of these\r\ndeep-seated igneous rocks with the older and metamorphosed volcanic\r\nand sedimentary members. Desolate volcanic hills of dull-green shade,\r\nwhose sides are covered with weathered debris of irregular outline,\r\nalternate with broad plain, out of which rise rounded masses\r\nof granite, or with mountain ranges, whose precipitous sides and\r\nserrated outlines constitute some of the most striking features of\r\nthe Red Sea hill scenery.\r\n\r\nThe final phase, that of the minor intrusions, is admirably\r\nillustrated in Egypt, large areas of the desert consisting of low\r\nridges formed of parallel bands or dykes of hard rocks, which have\r\nseamed the softer granite, the latter having subsequently been worn\r\ndown by erosion. In other cases the dyke is of more basic composition\r\nand more easily denuded than the adjacent rocks.\r\n\r\nWhen these evidences of past igneous activity are examined, they\r\nreveal the interplay of such varied and complicated chemical and\r\nphysical effects that a large volume would be required to set forth\r\nthe great body of facts observed. Of these only a bare statement of\r\nthe most incomplete order must suffice. Igneous rocks are of very\r\nvariable chemical composition, and for the purposes of discussion of\r\ntheir complex relationships have been subdivided into three series\r\naccording to the amount of silica they contain, viz.:—The Acid\r\nRocks with 50 to 70 per cent silica; The Intermediate Rocks with 50\r\nto 60 per cent silica; The Basic Rocks under 50 per cent silica. As a\r\nwhole, the igneous rocks are compounds of the silicates of alumina,\r\nmagnesia, lime, potash and soda, with oxide of iron; the silicates\r\nof alumina, soda and potash are most abundant at the acid end of\r\nthe scale, and those of lime, magnesia, with the oxides of iron\r\nand phosphates at the basic extreme. In consequence, the basic\r\nrocks are usually darker in colour and heavier than the more acid\r\nvarieties. Not only have the igneous rocks a varying composition,\r\nbut also a varying structure depending on the differences of\r\norigin and position. We may note their history as involving several\r\nstages, viz.:—(1) Solidification from the initial molten magma;\r\n(2) Deformation when under the influence of great earth pressures;\r\n(3) Transformation under the meteorological influences, at or near\r\nthe earth’s surface. In addition there are the contact alterations\r\nproduced near their junctions with the overlying strata, both within\r\nthemselves and in the beds affected by the molten material.\r\n\r\nA molten magma varies greatly in its behaviour according to\r\nits position, the solidification of that portion which remained\r\ndeep-seated in the hidden reservoir beneath the earth’s crust\r\ntaking place slowly and imperceptibly. A rock such as granite is\r\nnot formed suddenly by instantaneous cooling, but step by step\r\nindividual minerals are crystallized from the complex solution, and\r\ntend to develop as regular and often most beautiful crystals. It\r\nis a source of surprise to most to learn that the greater number\r\nof mineral substances, if free to develop from solution without\r\nexternal hindrances, tend to form solid bodies which are fashioned on\r\ngeometrical principles, constituting one of the most interesting and\r\nmysterious problems with which scientific thought has to deal. The\r\nminerals, as a rule, tend to crystallize out directly in the order\r\nof their basicity, the oxides of iron with their eight-sided crystals\r\nbeing among the first, so that their octahedral outlines are usually\r\nwell preserved. The other minerals of the rocks follow in succession;\r\nsometimes complicated intergrowths occur owing to two crystals of\r\ndifferent composition starting their formation at the same time in the\r\nsame portion of the solution. Finally, the last-formed minerals have\r\nto occupy the interspaces left by their consolidated neighbours, and\r\nin the more acid rocks this unenviable position is usually reserved\r\nfor the free silica, forming _quartz_. These deep-seated masses,\r\nslowly solidified and entirely crystalline in their structure,\r\nhave been called the _Plutonic_ rocks, the example familiar to all\r\ndwellers in Egypt being the red Aswan, or monumental granite. In it,\r\nthe felspars and micas or hornblendes present tend towards their\r\ntrue crystal form, while the quartz occupies the interspaces.\r\n\r\nIntermediate between the extruded volcanic rocks, and the highly\r\ncrystalline varieties of the internal reservoirs of molten material,\r\nare the dyke or hypabyssal rocks, which as narrow vertical or nearly\r\nvertical intrusions pass in all probability from the deep-seated\r\nsource towards the surface of the earth, when they reach it giving\r\nrise to volcanic effects. The dykes have a tendency to be parallel to\r\none another, and in some regions are the most conspicuous features,\r\nif harder than the surrounding rock giving rise to marked ridges\r\nseparated in many cases by comparatively shallow valleys. Not a few\r\nof the main summits in the Red Sea hills and Sinai have assumed their\r\npresent form and outline owing to the unequal denudation of one of\r\nthese hard bands, while many an ascent, which otherwise would have\r\nbeen by no means free from danger, is simplified by the formation of\r\ngullies due to the wearing away of the softer and more basic members\r\nof this series.\r\n\r\nIn the hypabyssal varieties, as well as in surface flows, an\r\nexamination of hand-specimens often reveals the presence of\r\nlarger crystals (usually termed porphyritic crystals) scattered\r\nin a ground-mass in which no definite structure is visible except\r\nunder the microscope. These may in part have been formed before\r\nthe molten magma of the rock had begun its upward ascent, but in\r\ngeneral they and the finer-grained base, have crystallized under\r\nsimilar conditions. Examinations of the ground-mass microscopically\r\nalso shows it to be entirely crystalline in its nature, but the\r\nindividual components are of very small size.\r\n\r\nIn the extruded volcanic rocks, on the other hand, the porphyritic\r\ncrystals are probably of much earlier date than the ground-mass in\r\nwhich they are present, the latter being solidified above-ground,\r\nwhere cooling was rapid, pressure suddenly reduced, and many of\r\nthe gaseous constituents were free to escape readily. As crystals\r\nrequire a certain temperature and a slow liberation of the heat for\r\ntheir formation, in many volcanic rocks the rapid cooling results\r\nin the production of a glass instead of a crystalline aggregate,\r\nso that the presence of a glassy matrix is in itself evidence of a\r\nquick loss of heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n               VII.—THE FORMATION OF METAMORPHIC ROCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll materials, both sedimentary and igneous, composing the earth’s\r\ncrust, are liable to be involved in movements of deformation, becoming\r\nsubject to pressures and chemical agencies, which are often intense\r\nin character and productive of far-reaching internal changes. The\r\nresult is the formation of a series of rocks, which may be of divers\r\norigins, but which having lost their original characteristics,\r\nmay be grouped as metamorphic. By the action of compression\r\nand dislocation not only are the major masses folded or broken,\r\nbut their individual constituents are brought into new relations\r\nboth as regards their external conditions and internal molecular\r\narrangement. Where lateral pressure has been active as regards the\r\nfiner-grained rocks, such as clays, the individual particles arrange\r\nthemselves with their longer axes at right angles to the pressure,\r\nthe result being the production of a fissile structure or cleavage,\r\ntotally distinct from the original bedding-planes of the strata.\r\n\r\nClays under such circumstances pass into slates, in which no very\r\ndefinite mineral banding is observed, or into schists, in which there\r\nis a tendency for the separate minerals, such as mica and quartz, to\r\nhave a pseudo-stratified appearance, though the individual layers,\r\nif closely examined, are found to be lenticular, not parallel in\r\nshape. These schists and slates are developed on a large scale in\r\nthe Red Sea hills and Sinai.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which compression and tension has been carried in\r\nthese ancient sedimentary strata is well indicated in Sinai, where\r\nrounded pebbles of quartz have been fractured, the two broken parts\r\nsomewhat separated, and the whole re-cemented in a schistose matrix.\r\n\r\nIn many instances, besides mechanical stress, another factor of\r\nmetamorphism of rocks has to be invoked to explain the phenomena\r\nobserved. Mineral changes take place in these rocks which are due\r\nto the superadding of thermal action, consequent on their direct\r\ncontact with molten masses of granitic and other plutonic rocks. In\r\nSinai, for instance, new minerals are called into existence by\r\nthese contact effects, members of the _andalusite_ group, which\r\nare formed at high temperatures, being produced near the junctions,\r\ngarnets being present in the mica-schists in a zone somewhat further\r\nremoved from the contact area, while beyond these is a belt where the\r\nslaty strata show only traces of the formation of the new minerals\r\nin the presence of ill-defined knots, or segregations forming the\r\nso-called “Knotenschiefer” of the Germans.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to trace the influence of these contact and dynamic\r\neffects, not only in the sedimentary rocks, but also in those of\r\nplutonic origin. An excellent example of such changes, known as\r\nfoliation, can be observed in the Dal Cataract, where a granite is\r\npresent containing large crystals of red felspar. It is possible\r\nto trace the change of this rock into a variety which instead\r\nof being massive, is banded, the bands containing the larger red\r\nfelspars all tending to lie in one plane. These are not parallel,\r\nbut lenticular, certain of the minerals, especially the felspars,\r\nremaining comparatively unaffected as “eyes,” round which the\r\nother minerals appear to sweep. The quartz in many instances is\r\nfound to be crushed into a mosaic of small grains, and the plates\r\nof mica have been dragged out and separated from one another by\r\nthe shearing. These rocks, having a general composition resembling\r\nthe granites, have been termed gneisses, and in some cases, similar\r\neffects have been produced by the intrusion of veins of granite along\r\nthe horizontal planes of a more basic rock already banded. This result\r\nis well seen in the Third Cataract, where a foliated rock composed of\r\na white felspar and mica has been pierced by veins of highly quartzose\r\ngranite, which has then spread along the laminæ of the older member.\r\n\r\nSimilarly in Sinai, the granite, where in contact with the schistose\r\nsedimentary beds, has in certain favourable localities penetrated\r\nbetween the schistose layers, producing a banded rock which approaches\r\na gneiss in character.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt, we are not at present acquainted with such gigantic\r\noverfolding, fracture, and pushing of whole masses of strata one\r\nover the other, as have been studied, for example, in the North-West\r\nHighlands of Scotland, but there is in Egypt itself, a vast series\r\nof gneisses, crystalline schists, marbles and dolomites whose\r\norigin is but dimly understood, and which may represent changes\r\nlong anterior those exhibited by the ancient rocks of which we have\r\nbeen speaking. Developed in the untrodden wastes of the Sudan, in\r\nthe wilder stretches of the Cataracts, in the desolate regions of\r\nthe Etbai Desert of Egypt, their study is attended with difficulty\r\nand all our hypotheses must depend on the comparison of isolated\r\nspecimens with similar rocks from more favoured regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SUMMARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.—Every rock originates either from the solidification of\r\nmolten material or of sediments, these constituting the Igneous and\r\nSedimentary Rocks respectively.\r\n\r\n2.—These may undergo deformation due to movements of the earth’s\r\ncrust, such movements according to their intensity determining\r\nthe re-arrangement of the constituents with the development of new\r\nstructures, producing the Metamorphic Rocks.\r\n\r\n3.—These varied rocks, when exposed at the earth’s surface, are\r\nbrought under the influence of the agents of transformation, such as\r\nfrost, contraction and expansion due to variations of temperature,\r\nthe mechanical action of rain, sand borne by wind, and running\r\nwater in the form of streams. In addition to these purely physical\r\nactivities are others of a chemical nature, either proceeding from\r\nchanges outside the terrestrial surface (carbonic acid dissolved in\r\nrain, etc.), or from processes operating within the earth’s crust\r\n(production of petroleum, coal, mineral veins, etc.).\r\n\r\n4.—The chemical and physical activities deep within the earth’s\r\ncrust result in the formation of the plutonic rocks solidified from\r\nmolten solutions, intimately associated with them being the external\r\nmanifestations of the working of these hidden forces as revealed in\r\nvolcanoes and their associated phenomena.\r\n\r\n5.—By the surface changes on the consolidated igneous and other\r\nrocks, the materials are supplied for the formation of some of the\r\nmembers of the sedimentary series, the sands and clays, while the\r\nlimestones in large measure owe their origin to the property possessed\r\nby living animals of constructing shells from the carbonate of lime\r\nbrought in solution to the oceans, etc., these shells, after the death\r\nof the animals, contributing to the formation of the calcareous rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In geology, the term _rock_ is applied alike to the soft\r\nand hard materials composing the earth’s crust, as sands may pass\r\ninto solid sandstones, soft muds become the most tenacious of clays,\r\nand hard basalt originate as a molten lava.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: This statement may not absolutely apply to Cairo itself,\r\nseeing that in the disturbed region of Abu Roash sandstone is actually\r\nat the surface, and the clays are less conspicuously developed than\r\nis the case to the south.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Figs. 1, 2 and 4 are based on photographs of localities\r\nin Great Britain and Ireland taken for the Geologists’ Association\r\ncollection of photographs.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Farafra is an exception to this rule, the depression\r\nbeing due to the wearing away of soft Cretaceous beds higher than\r\nthe sandstone.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The well-known Petrified Forests.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: From information given by Mr. Harding King.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: At Abu Radham a dark layer of purple iron ochre seems\r\nto have been the cause of the investigation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: For further details, see my paper “Petroleum:\r\nIts occurrence and origin,” Cairo Scientific Journal, No. 48,\r\npp. 205-218.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: “The Natural History of Igneous Rocks,” p. 23.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SHORT CATALOGUE\r\n                                OF THE\r\n                    =MAPS, PLANS, AND PUBLICATIONS=\r\n                             ISSUED BY THE\r\n            SURVEY DEPARTMENT, MINISTRY OF FINANCE, EGYPT.\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n                           =MAPS AND PLANS.=\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe following is a general list of the maps and plans offered for\r\nsale by the Survey Department.
