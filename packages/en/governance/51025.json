PRESIDENT,--Before the vote is taken I desire to make one remark. I\r\nwas struck with the suggestion of the Senator from Ohio [Mr. SHERMAN],\r\nthe other day, with regard to the proposition which comes from the\r\nHouse. He reminded us that it was a House proposition, and that it was\r\nnatural that the House should be allowed to regulate itself. I think\r\nthere is much in that worthy of consideration. I doubt if the Senate\r\nwould receive with much favor any proposition from the House especially\r\napplicable to us. I think we should be disposed to repel it. I think we\r\nshould say that our experience should enable us to judge that question\r\nbetter than the experience of the House. And now I ask whether the\r\nexperience of the House does not enable them to judge of the question\r\nof numbers better than we can judge of it? On general grounds I confess\r\nI should myself prefer a smaller House; personally I incline that way;\r\nbut I am not willing on that point to set myself against the House.\r\n\r\nThen, Sir, I cannot be insensible to the experience of other countries.\r\nI do not know whether Senators have troubled themselves on that head;\r\nbut if they have not, I think it will not be uninteresting to them to\r\nhave their attention called to the numbers of the great legislative\r\nbodies of the world at this moment. For instance, beginning with\r\nEngland, there is the upper House, the Chamber of Peers, composed of\r\nfour hundred and sixty-six members; then the lower House, the House\r\nof Commons, with six hundred and fifty-eight members. We know that,\r\npractically, these members attend only in comparatively small numbers;\r\nthat it is only on great questions that either House is full.\r\n\r\n    MR. TRUMBULL. Did the House of Lords ever have anything like that\r\n    number present?\r\n\r\nMR. SUMNER. It has had several hundred. There are four hundred and\r\nsixty-six entitled to seats in the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nPass over to France. The National Assembly, sitting at Versailles at\r\nthis moment, elected February 8 and July 2, 1871, consists of seven\r\nhundred and thirty-eight members.\r\n\r\nPass on to Prussia. The upper Chamber of the Parliament of Prussia has\r\ntwo hundred and sixty-seven members; the lower Chamber has four hundred\r\nand thirty-two. Now we all know that Prussia is a country where no rule\r\nof administration or of constitution is adopted lightly, and everything\r\nis considered, if I may so express myself, in the light of science.\r\n\r\nPass to Austria, under the recent organization. You are aware that\r\nthere are two different Parliaments now in Austria,--one for what is\r\ncalled the cis-Leithan territories, territories this side of the river\r\nLeitha; the other, trans-Leithan, or those on the other side, being the\r\nHungarian territory. Beginning with those on this side of the river,\r\nthe upper House consists of one hundred and seventy-five members:\r\nobserve, it is more than twice as large as our Senate. The lower House\r\nconsists of two hundred and three members: smaller than our House of\r\nRepresentatives. But now pass to the other side of the river and look\r\nat the Hungarian Parliament. There the upper House contains two hundred\r\nand sixty-six members, and the lower House, or Chamber of Deputies, as\r\nit is called, four hundred and thirty-eight.\r\n\r\nPass to Italy, a country organized under a new constitution in the\r\nlight of European and American experience, liberal, and with a\r\ndisposition to found its institutions on the basis of science. The\r\nSenate of Italy contains two hundred and seventy members, the Chamber\r\nof Deputies five hundred and eight.\r\n\r\nThen pass to Spain. There the upper branch of the Cortes contains one\r\nhundred and ninety-six members, and the lower branch four hundred and\r\nsixteen.\r\n\r\nSo that you will find in all these countries,--Great Britain, France,\r\nPrussia, Austria in its two Parliaments, Italy, and Spain,--that the\r\nnumber adopted for the lower House is much larger than any now proposed\r\nfor our House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nI call attention to this fact because it illustrates by the experience\r\nof other nations what may be considered as a rule on this subject. At\r\nany rate, it shows that other nations are not deterred by anything in\r\npolitical experience from having a House with these large numbers;\r\nand this perhaps is of more value because European writers, political\r\nphilosophers for successive generations, have warred against large\r\nbodies. We have the famous saying of the Cardinal de Retz, that\r\nany body of men above a hundred is a mob; and that saying, coming\r\nfrom so consummate a statesman and wit, has passed into a proverb,\r\ndoubtless affecting the judgment of many minds; and yet in the face of\r\nthis testimony, and with the writings of political philosophers all\r\ninclining against numbers, we find that the actual practical experience\r\nof Europe has gone the other way. The popular branch in all these\r\nconsiderable countries is much more numerous than it is now proposed to\r\nmake our House of Representatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREFORM AND PURITY IN GOVERNMENT: NEUTRAL DUTIES. SALE OF ARMS TO\r\nBELLIGERENT FRANCE.\r\n\r\nSPEECH IN THE SENATE, FEBRUARY 28, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n    February 12, 1872, Mr. Sumner introduced a resolution, with a\r\n    preamble setting forth its grounds, providing,--\r\n\r\n        “That a select committee of seven be appointed to investigate\r\n        all sales of ordnance stores made by the Government of the\r\n        United States during the war between France and Germany;\r\n        to ascertain the persons to whom such sales were made, the\r\n        circumstances under which they were made, and the real parties\r\n        in interest, and the sums respectively paid and received by the\r\n        real parties; and that the committee have power to send for\r\n        persons and papers; and that the investigation be conducted in\r\n        public.”\r\n\r\n    And on his motion it was ordered to lie on the table and be printed.\r\n\r\n    On the 14th the resolution was taken up for consideration, when\r\n    Mr. Sumner entered into an exposition of the matter referred to\r\n    in the preamble, and of the law applicable thereto, remarking in\r\n    conclusion:--\r\n\r\n        “For the first time has the United States, within my knowledge,\r\n        fallen under suspicion of violating the requirement of\r\n        neutrality on this subject. Such seems to be our present\r\n        position. We are under suspicion. What I propose is a searching\r\n        inquiry, according to the magnitude of the interests involved,\r\n        to ascertain if this is without just grounds.”\r\n\r\n    Thereupon ensued a long and acrimonious debate,--toward the close\r\n    of which, Mr. Sumner, on the 28th, in review of the case, spoke as\r\n    follows:--\r\n\r\nMR PRESIDENT,--Besides the unaccustomed interest which this debate\r\nexcites, I cannot fail to note that it has wandered far beyond any\r\npurpose of mine, and into fields where I have no desire to follow. In\r\na few plain remarks I shall try to bring it back to the real issue,\r\nwhich I hope to present without passion or prejudice. I declare only\r\nthe rule of my life, when I say that nothing shall fall from me to-day\r\nwhich is not prompted by the love of truth and the desire for justice;\r\nbut you will pardon me, if I remember that there is something on this\r\nplanet higher than the Senate or any Senator, higher than any public\r\nfunctionary, higher than any political party: it is the good name of\r\nthe American people and the purity of Government, which must be saved\r\nfrom scandal. In this spirit and with this aspiration I shall speak\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nIn considering this resolution we must not forget the peculiar\r\ndemands of the present moment. An aroused community in the commercial\r\nmetropolis of our country has unexpectedly succeeded in overthrowing a\r\ncorrupt ring by which millions of money had been sacrificed. Tammany\r\nhas been vanquished. Here good Democrats vied with Republicans. The\r\ncountry was thrilled by the triumph, and insisted that it should\r\nbe extended. Then came manifestations against abuses of the civil\r\nservice generally, and especially in that other Tammany, the New York\r\ncustom-house. The call for investigation at last prevailed in this\r\nChamber, and the newspapers have been burdened since with odious\r\ndetails. Everybody says there must be reform, so that the Government\r\nin all its branches shall be above suspicion. The cry for reform is\r\neverywhere,--from New York to New Orleans. Within a few days we hear\r\nof a great meeting, amounting to ten thousand, in the latter city,\r\nwithout distinction of party, calling for reform; and the demand is\r\nechoed from place to place. Reform is becoming a universal watchword.\r\n\r\nIn harmony with this cry is the appointment of a Civil-Service\r\nCommission, which has proposed mild measures looking to purity and\r\nindependence in office-holders.\r\n\r\nAmidst these transactions, occupying the attention of the country,\r\ncertain facts are reported, tending to show abuses in the sale of arms\r\nat the Ordnance Office, exciting at least suspicion in that quarter;\r\nand this is aggravated by a seeming violation of neutral duties at a\r\ncritical moment, when, on various grounds, the nation was bound to\r\npeculiar care. It appeared as if our neutral duties were sacrificed to\r\nmoney-making, if not to official jobbers. The injunction of Iago seemed\r\nto be obeyed: “Put money in thy purse.” These things were already known\r\nin Europe, especially through a notorious trial,[1] and then by a\r\nlegislative inquiry, so as to become a public scandal. It was time that\r\nsomething should be done to remove the suspicion. This could be only\r\nby a searching investigation in such way as to satisfy all at home and\r\nabroad that there was no whitewashing.\r\n\r\nIn proportion to the magnitude of the question and the great interests\r\ninvolved, whether of money or neutral duty, was the corresponding\r\nresponsibility on our part. Here was a case for action without delay.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I brought forward the present motion. Here\r\nI acted in entire harmony with that movement, now so much applauded,\r\nwhich overthrew Tammany, and that other movement which has exposed\r\nthe Custom-House. Its object was inquiry into the sale of arms. This\r\nwas the objective point. But much of this debate has turned on points\r\nmerely formal, if not entirely irrelevant.\r\n\r\nMore than once it has been asserted that I am introducing “politics”;\r\nand then we have been reminded of the Presidential election, which to\r\ncertain Senators is a universal prompter. I asked for reform, and the\r\nSenator from Indiana [Mr. MORTON], seizing the party bugle, sounded “To\r\narms!” But I am not tempted to follow him. I have nothing to say of\r\nthe President or of the Presidential election. The Senator cannot make\r\nme depart from the rule I have laid down for myself. I introduce no\r\n“politics,” but only a question which has become urgent, affecting the\r\ncivil service of the country.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, I have been from the beginning in favor of civil-service\r\nreform. I am the author of the first bill on that subject ever\r\nintroduced into Congress, as long ago as the spring of 1864.[2] I am\r\nfor a real reform that shall reach the highest as well as the lowest,\r\nand I know no better way to accomplish this beneficent result than by\r\nstriving at all times for purity in the administration of Government.\r\nTherefore, when officials fall under suspicion, I should feel myself\r\ndisloyal to the Government, if I did not insist on the most thorough\r\ninquiry. So I have voted in the past, so I must vote in the future.\r\nCall you this politics? Not in the ordinary sense of the term. It is\r\nonly honesty and a just regard for the public weal.\r\n\r\nThen it has been said that I am a French agent, and even a Prussian\r\nagent,--two in one. Sir, I am nothing but a Senator, whose attention\r\nwas first called to this matter by a distinguished citizen not named in\r\nthis debate. Since then I have obtained such information with regard to\r\nit as was open to me,--all going to develop a case for inquiry.\r\n\r\nI should say nothing more in reply to this allegation but for the\r\nvindictive personal assault made upon a valued friend, the Marquis de\r\nChambrun. The Senator from Missouri [Mr. SCHURZ] has already spoken\r\nfor him; but I claim this privilege also. Besides his own merits,\r\nthis gentleman is commended to Americans by his association with the\r\ntwo French names most cherished in our country, Lafayette and De\r\nTocqueville. I have known him from the very day of his arrival in\r\nWashington early in the spring of 1865, and have seen him since, in\r\nunbroken friendship, almost daily. Shortly after his arrival I took him\r\nwith me on a visit to Mr. Lincoln at the front, close upon the capture\r\nof Richmond. This stranger began his remarkable intimacy with American\r\nlife by several days in the society of the President only one week\r\nbefore his death. He was by the side of the President in his last visit\r\nto a military hospital, and when he last shook hands with the soldiers;\r\nalso when he made his last speech from the window of the Executive\r\nMansion, the stranger was his guest, standing by his side. From that\r\ntime down to this day of accusation his intimacies have extended beyond\r\nthose of any other foreigner. His studies of our institutions have been\r\nminute and critical, being second only to those of his late friend De\r\nTocqueville. Whether conversing on his own country or on ours, he is\r\nalways at home.\r\n\r\nIf at any time the Marquis de Chambrun sustained official relations\r\nwith the French Government, or was its agent, he never spoke of it to\r\nme; nor did I ever know it until the papers produced by the Senator\r\nfrom Iowa [Mr. HARLAN]. Our conversation was always that of friends,\r\nand on topics of general interest, not of business. Though ignorant\r\nof any official relations with his own Government, I could not fail\r\nto know his close relations with members of our Government, ending in\r\nhis recent employment to present our case in French for the Geneva\r\ntribunal,--an honorable and confidential service, faithfully performed.\r\n\r\nThe Senator from Indiana knew of the arms question some five months\r\nbefore the meeting of Congress. I did not. It was after the session\r\nbegan, and just before the holidays, that I first knew of it. And\r\nhere my informant was not a foreigner, but, as I have already said, a\r\ndistinguished citizen. The French “spy,” as he is so happily called,\r\nthough with me daily, never spoke of it; nor did I speak of it to\r\nhim. By-and-by the Senator from Missouri mentioned it, and then, in\r\nmy desire to know the evidence affecting persons here, if any such\r\nexisted, I spoke to my French friend. This was only a few days before\r\nthe resolution.\r\n\r\nSuch is the history of my relations with the accused. There is nothing\r\nto disguise, nothing that I should not do again. I know no rule of\r\nsenatorial duty or of patriotism which can prevent me from obtaining\r\ninformation of any kind from any body, especially when the object is to\r\npursue fraud and to unmask abuse. Is not a French gentleman a competent\r\nwitness? Once the black could not testify against the white, and now\r\nin some places the testimony of a Chinese is rejected. But I tolerate\r\nno such exclusion. Let me welcome knowledge always, and from every\r\nquarter. “Hail, holy light!”--no matter from what star or what nation\r\nit may shine.\r\n\r\nAnd this gentleman, fresh from a confidential service to our own\r\nGovernment, enjoying numerous intimacies with American citizens,\r\nassociated with illustrious names in history and literature, and\r\nimmediately connected with one of the highest functionaries of the\r\npresent French Government, M. de Rémusat, Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\nis insulted here as an “emissary” and a “spy”; nay, more, France is\r\ninsulted,--for these terms are applied only to the secret agents of\r\nan enemy in time of war. But enough. To such madness of error and\r\nvindictive accusation is this defence carried!\r\n\r\nAnother charge is that I am making a case for Prussia against our own\r\ncountry. Oh, no! I am making a case for nobody. I simply try to relieve\r\nmy country from an odious suspicion, and to advance the cause of good\r\ngovernment. The Senator from Indiana supposes that this effort of mine,\r\nhaving such objects, may prejudice the Emperor of Germany against us\r\nin the arbitration of the San Juan question. The Senator does not pay\r\na lofty compliment to that enlightened and victorious ruler. Nay, Sir,\r\nthe very suggestion of the Senator is an insult to him, which he is too\r\njust to resent, but which cannot fail to excite a smile of derision.\r\nSurely the Senator was not in earnest.\r\n\r\nThe jest of the Senator, offered for argument, seems to forget that\r\nall these things are notorious in Europe, through the active press of\r\nParis and London. Why, Sir, our own State Department furnishes official\r\nevidence that the alleged sale of arms to the French by our Government\r\nis known in Berlin itself, right under the eyes of the Emperor. Our\r\nMinister there, Mr. Bancroft, in his dispatch of January 7, 1871,\r\nfurnishes the following testimony from the London “Times”:--\r\n\r\n    “During the Crimean War, arms and munitions of war had been freely\r\n    exported from Prussia to Russia; and recently rifled cannon\r\n    and ammunition have been furnished to the French in enormous\r\n    quantities, _not only by private American traders, but by the War\r\n    Department at Washington_.”[3]\r\n\r\nThese latter words are italicized in the official publication of our\r\nGovernment, and thus blazoned to the world. I do not adduce them to\r\nshow that the War Department did sell arms to belligerent France, but\r\nthat even in Berlin the imputation upon us was known and actually\r\nreported by our Minister. If the latter made any observations on\r\nthis imputation I know not; for at this point in his dispatch are\r\nthose convenient asterisks which are the substitute for inconvenient\r\nrevelations.\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit with the last triviality, but in the anxiety to\r\nclutch at something, it is said that the Alabama Claims are endangered\r\nby this inquiry. Very well, Sir. On this point I am clear. If these\r\nhistoric claims, so interesting to the American people, are to be\r\npressed at the cost of purity in our own Government, they are not worth\r\nthe terrible price. Better give them up at once. Let them all go, every\r\ndollar. “First pure, then peaceable”;[4] above all things purity. Sir,\r\nI have from the beginning insisted that England should be held to just\r\naccount for her violation of international duty toward us. Is that\r\nany reason why I should not also insist upon inquiry into the conduct\r\nof officials at home, to the end that the Government may be saved\r\nfrom reproach? Surely we shall be stronger, infinitely stronger, in\r\ndemanding our own rights, if we show a determination to allow no wrong\r\namong ourselves. Our example must not be quoted against us at any time.\r\nEspecially must it not be allowed to harden into precedent. But this\r\ncan be prevented only by prompt correction, so that it shall be without\r\nauthority. Therefore, because I would have my country irresistible in\r\nits demands, do I insist that it shall place itself above all suspicion.\r\n\r\nThe objection of Senators is too much like the old heathen cry, “Our\r\ncountry, right or wrong.” Unhappy words, which dethrone God and exalt\r\nthe Devil! I am for our country with the aspiration that it may be\r\nalways right; but I am for nothing wrong. When I hear of wrong, I\r\ninsist at all hazards that it shall be made right, knowing that in this\r\nway I best serve my country and every just cause.\r\n\r\nThis same objection assumes another form, equally groundless, when it\r\nis said that I reflect upon our country and hurt its good name. Oh, no!\r\nThey reflect upon our country and hurt its good name who at the first\r\nbreath of suspicion fail to act. Our good name is not to be preserved\r\nby covering up anything. Not in secrecy, but in daylight, must we live.\r\nWhat sort of good name is that which has a cloud gathering about it?\r\nOur duty is to dispel the cloud. Especially is this the duty of the\r\nSenate. Here at least must be that honest independence which shall\r\ninsist at all times upon purity in the Government, no matter what\r\noffice-holders are exposed.\r\n\r\nAgain it is said that our good name cannot be compromised by these\r\nsuspicions. This is a mistake. Any suspicion of wrong is a compromise,\r\nall the more serious when it concerns not only money, but the violation\r\nof neutral obligations. And the actual fact is precisely according to\r\nreason. Now while we debate, the national character is compromised at\r\nParis, at London, at Berlin, at Geneva, where all these things are\r\nknown as much as in this Chamber. But your indifference, especially\r\nafter this debate, will not tend to elevate the national character\r\neither at home or abroad.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the objections to which I reply. They are words only,\r\nas Hamlet says, “Words, words, words.” From words let us pass to things.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. President, I come now to the simple question before the Senate,\r\nwhich I presented originally, whether there is not sufficient reason\r\nfor inquiry into the sale of arms during the French and German War. I\r\nstate the question thus broadly. The inquiry is into the sale of arms;\r\nand this opens two questions,--first, of international duty; and,\r\nsecondly, of misfeasance in our officials, the latter involving what\r\nmay be compendiously called the money question.\r\n\r\nMy object is simply to show grounds for inquiry; and I naturally begin\r\nwith the rule of international duty.\r\n\r\nIn the discharge of neutral obligations a nation is bound to _good\r\nfaith_. This is the supreme rule, to which all else is subordinate.\r\nThis is the starting-point of all that is done. Without good faith\r\nneutral obligations must fail. In proportion to the character of this\r\nrequirement must be the completeness of its observance. There can be\r\nno evasion, not a jot. Any evasion is a breach, without the bravery\r\nof open violation. But evasion may be sometimes by closing the eyes to\r\nexisting facts, or even by acting without sufficient inquiry. These\r\nthings are so plain and entirely reasonable as to be self-evident.\r\n\r\nNow nothing can be more clear than that no neutral nation is permitted\r\nto furnish arms and war material to a belligerent power. Such is a\r\nsimple statement of the law. I do not cite authorities, as I did it\r\namply on a former occasion.[5]\r\n\r\nBut there is an excellent author whom I would add to the list as worthy\r\nof consideration, especially at this moment, in view of the loose\r\npretensions put forth in the debate. I refer to Mr. Manning, who, in\r\nhis Commentaries, thus teaches neutral duty:--\r\n\r\n    “It is no interference with the right of a third party to say that\r\n    he shall not carry to my enemy instruments with which I am to be\r\n    attacked. Such commerce is, on the other hand, a deviation from\r\n    neutrality,--or rather would be so, _if it were the act of a State_\r\n    and not of individuals.”[6]\r\n\r\nThe distinction is obvious between what can be done by the individual\r\nand what can be done by the State. The individual may play the merchant\r\nand take the risk of capture; but the State cannot play the merchant\r\nin dealing with a belligerent. Of course, if the foreign power is at\r\npeace, there is no question; but when the power has become belligerent,\r\nthen it is excluded from the market. So far as that power is concerned,\r\nall sales must be suspended. The interdict is peremptory and absolute.\r\nIn such a case there can be no sale knowingly without mixing in the\r\nwar,--precisely as France mixed in the war of our Revolution in those\r\nmuskets sent by the witty Beaumarchais, which England resented by open\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nAnd this undoubted principle of International Law was recognized by\r\nthe Secretary of War, when he directed the Chief of Ordnance not to\r\nentertain any bids from E. Remington & Sons, who had stated that they\r\nwere agents of the French Government. In giving these orders he only\r\nfollowed the rule of duty on which the country can stand without\r\nquestion or reproach; but it remains to be seen whether persons under\r\nhim did not content themselves with obeying the order in letter only,\r\nbreaking it in spirit. I assume that the order was given in good faith.\r\nWas it obeyed in good faith? Here we start with the admitted postulate\r\nthat it was wrong to sell arms to France.\r\n\r\nBut if this cannot be done directly, it is idle to say that it can be\r\ndone indirectly without a violation of good faith. If it cannot be done\r\nopenly, it cannot be done privily. If it cannot be done above-board, it\r\ncannot be done clandestinely. It is idle to reject the bid of the open\r\nagent of a belligerent power and then at once accept the bid of another\r\nwho may be a mere man-of-straw, unless after careful inquiry into his\r\nreal character.\r\n\r\nNothing can be clearer than the duty of the proper officers to consider\r\nall bids in the sunlight of the conspicuous events then passing. A\r\nterrible war was convulsing the Old World. Two mighty nations were in\r\nconflict, one of which was already prostrate _and disarmed_. Meanwhile\r\ncame bids for arms and war material on a gigantic scale, on a scale\r\nabsolutely unprecedented. Plainly these powerful batteries, these\r\nmuskets by the hundred thousand, and these cartridges by the million\r\nwere for the disarmed belligerent and nobody else. It was impossible\r\nnot to see it. It is insulting to common-sense to imagine it otherwise.\r\nWho else could need arms and war material to the amount of four million\r\ndollars at once? Now it appears by the dispatches of the French\r\nConsul-General at New York, which I find in an official document, that\r\non the 22d October, 1870, he telegraphed to the Armament Commission at\r\nTours:--\r\n\r\n    “The prices of adjudication have been 100,000 muskets at $9.30;\r\n    40,000 at $12.30; 100,000 at $12.25; 50,000,000 cartridges at\r\n    $16.30 the thousand: altogether, with the commission to Remington\r\n    and the incidental expenses, more than four million dollars.”\r\n\r\nSuch gigantic purchases, made at one time, or in the space of a few\r\ndays, could have but one destination. It is weakness to imagine\r\notherwise. Obviously, plainly, unquestionably, they were for the\r\ndisarmed belligerent. The telegraph each morning proclaimed the\r\nconstant fearful struggle, and we all became daily spectators. In the\r\nterrible blaze, filling the heavens with lurid flame, it was impossible\r\nnot to see the exact condition of the two belligerents,--Germany always\r\nvictorious, France still rallying for the desperate battle. But the\r\nofficials of the Ordnance Bureau saw this as plainly as the people.\r\nTherefore were they warned, so that every applicant for arms and war\r\nmaterial on a large scale was open to just suspicion. These officials\r\nwere put on their guard as much as if a notice or _caveat_ had been\r\nfiled at the War Department. In neglecting that commanding notice,\r\nin overruling that unprecedented _caveat_, so far as to allow these\r\nenormous supplies to be forwarded to the disarmed belligerent, they\r\nfailed in that proper care required by the occasion. If I said that\r\nthey failed in good faith, I should only give the conclusion of law on\r\nunquestionable facts.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the _Gran Para_, Chief-Justice Marshall, after exposing\r\nan attempt to evade our neutral obligations by an ingenious cover,\r\nexclaimed, in words which he borrowed from an earlier period of our\r\nhistory, but which have been often quoted since: “This would, indeed,\r\nbe a fraudulent neutrality, disgraceful to our own Government, and\r\nof which no nation would be the dupe.”[7] I forbear at present to\r\napply these memorable words, which show with what indignant language\r\nour great Chief-Justice blasted an attempt to evade our neutral\r\nobligations. In calling it fraudulent he was not deterred by the petty\r\ncry of a false patriotism, that his judgment might affect the good name\r\nof our country. Full well he knew that national character could suffer\r\nonly where fraud is maintained.\r\n\r\nI doubt much if the true rule can be laid down in better words than\r\nthose I quoted on a former occasion from the Spanish minister at\r\nStockholm, denouncing the sale of Swedish frigates.[8] He protested\r\nagainst “arms and munitions furnished through _intermediate\r\nspeculators_, under pretence of not knowing the result,” which\r\nhe exhibited as an “act of hostility” and a “political scandal.”\r\nAccording to this excellent protest, the sale is not protected from\r\ncondemnation merely by “intermediate speculators” and the “pretence\r\nof not knowing the result.” And this is only according to undoubted\r\nreason. It is simply a question of good faith; and if, taking into view\r\nthe circumstances of the case and the condition of the times, there\r\nis reasonable ground to believe that “intermediate speculators” are\r\npurchasing for a belligerent, then the sale cannot be made, nor will\r\nany “pretence of not knowing the result” be of avail.\r\n\r\nIn harmony with this Spanish protest is the calm statement of a Joint\r\nCommittee of Congress, where this question of international duty is\r\ntreated wisely. I read from the report of Mr. Jenckes on the sale of\r\ncertain ironclads:--\r\n\r\n    “Perhaps the international feature of this transaction is the\r\n    most grave one for the consideration of Congress. It is a matter\r\n    of notorious public history that war was being carried on in the\r\n    years 1865 and 1866 between the Government of Spain, on the one\r\n    hand, and the Governments of Peru and Chili, on the other. During\r\n    the pendency of hostilities, applications were made to obtain\r\n    possession of these vessels for one of the belligerents. If the\r\n    Government of the United States had been _privy_ to any arrangement\r\n    by which these vessels of war should be delivered to the agents\r\n    of a belligerent, either in our own ports or upon the high seas,\r\n    it would certainly have violated its international obligations.\r\n    Of course, when Congress authorized the sale of these vessels, it\r\n    was known that individuals had no use for them; yet it might have\r\n    assumed, as in the case of the Dunderberg and the Onondaga,”--\r\n\r\nNow mark the words, if you please,--\r\n\r\n    “that the Executive Department would take care that any\r\n    individual who should purchase with a view to a resale to some\r\n    foreign power would not be permitted to violate the obligations of\r\n    the United States as a neutral nation.”[9]\r\n\r\nObserve, if you please, the language employed. If the Government of the\r\nUnited States had been “privy” to any arrangement for the delivery of\r\nthese vessels to the agents of a belligerent, it would certainly have\r\nviolated its international obligations. This is undoubtedly correct.\r\nThen comes the assumption “that the Executive Department would _take\r\ncare_ that any individual who should purchase _with a view to a resale_\r\nto some foreign power would not be permitted to violate the obligations\r\nof the United States as a neutral nation.” Here again is the true rule.\r\nThe Executive is bound to take care that there shall be no sale with a\r\nview to a resale in violation of neutral duties.\r\n\r\nAll this is so entirely reasonable, indeed so absolutely essential to\r\nthe simplest performance of international duty, that I feel humbled\r\neven in stating it. The case is too clear. It is like arguing the\r\nTen Commandments or the Multiplication Table. International Law is\r\nnothing but international morality for the guidance of nations. And\r\nbe assured, Sir, that interpretation is the truest which subjects the\r\nnation most completely to the Moral Law. “Thou shalt not sell arms\r\nto a belligerent,” is a commandment addressed to nations, and to be\r\nobeyed precisely as that other commandment, “Thou shalt not steal.”\r\nNo temptation of money, no proffer of cash, no chink of “the almighty\r\ndollar,” can excuse any departure from this supreme law; nor can any\r\nintervening man-of-straw have any other effect than to augment the\r\noffence by the shame of a trick.\r\n\r\nHere, Sir, I am sensitive for my country. I can imagine no pecuniary\r\nprofits, no millions poured into the Treasury, that can compensate for\r\na departure from that international honesty which is at once the best\r\npolicy and the highest duty. The dishonesty of a nation is illimitable\r\nin its operation. How true are the words,--\r\n\r\n    “’Twill be recorded for a precedent;\r\n    And many an error, by the same example,\r\n    Will rush into the State: it cannot be.”[10]\r\n\r\nThe demoralization is felt not at home only. Whatever any nation does\r\nis an example for other nations; whatever the Great Republic does is a\r\ntestimony. I would have that testimony pure, lofty, just, so that we\r\nmay welcome it when commended to ourselves; so that, indeed, it may be\r\na glorious landmark in the history of civilization.\r\n\r\nTherefore do I insist that international obligations, especially when\r\nwar is raging, cannot be evaded, cannot be slighted, cannot be trifled\r\nwith. They are not only sacred, they are sacrosanct; and whoso lays\r\nhands on them, whoso neglects them, whoso closes his eyes to their\r\nviolation, is guilty of a dishonesty which, to the extent of its\r\ninfluence, must weaken public morals at home, while it impairs the\r\nsafeguards of peace with other nations and sets ajar the very gates of\r\nWar.\r\n\r\nThis question cannot be treated with levity, and waved out of sight\r\nby a doubtful story. Even if Count Bismarck, adapting himself to the\r\nsituation, and anxious to avoid additional controversy, had declared\r\nin conversation that he would take these arms on the banks of the\r\nLoire,[11] this is no excuse for us. Our rule of duty is not found\r\nin the courageous gayety of any foreign statesman, but in the Law of\r\nNations, which we are bound to obey, not only for the sake of others,\r\nbut for the sake of ourselves. All other nations may be silent; Count\r\nBismarck may be taciturn; but we cannot afford to cry, “Hush!” The evil\r\nexample must be corrected, and the more swiftly the better.\r\n\r\nOn this simple statement of International Law, it is evident that\r\nthere must be inquiry to see if through the misfeasance of officials\r\nour Government has not in some way failed to comply with its neutral\r\nduties. Subordinates in England are charged with allowing the escape of\r\nthe Alabama. Have any subordinates among us played a similar part? It\r\nis of subordinates that I speak. Has the Government suffered through\r\nthem? Has their misfeasance, their jobbery, their illicit dealing,\r\ncompromised our country? Is there any ring about the Ordnance Bureau\r\nthrough which our neutral duties have been set at nought? Here I might\r\nstop without proceeding further. The question is too grave to be\r\nblinked out of sight; it must be met on the law and the facts.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation I do not argue. The case requires a statement\r\nonly. Beyond this I point to the honorable example which our country\r\nhas set in times past. The equity with which we have discharged our\r\nneutral obligations has been the occasion of constant applause. Mr.\r\nWard, the accomplished historian of the Law of Nations, and also\r\nof a treatise on the “Rights and Duties of Belligerent and Neutral\r\nPowers,” which Chancellor Kent says “exhausted all the law and learning\r\napplicable to the question,”[12] wrote in 1801, four years after\r\nWashington’s retirement:--\r\n\r\n    “Of the great trading nations, America is almost the only one that\r\n    has shown consistency of principle. The firmness and thorough\r\n    understanding of the Laws of Nations, which during this war [the\r\n    French Revolution] she has displayed, must forever rank her high in\r\n    the scale of enlightened communities.”[13]\r\n\r\nAnother English writer, Sir Robert Phillimore, author of the\r\ncomprehensive work on International Law, speaks of the conduct of the\r\nUnited States as, “under the most trying circumstances, marked not only\r\nby a perfect consistency, but by _preference for duty and right_ over\r\ninterest and the expediency of the moment.”[14] Then again, in another\r\nplace, the same English authority, after a summary of our practice and\r\njurisprudence in seizing and condemning vessels captured in violation\r\nof neutrality, declares:--\r\n\r\n    “In these doctrines a severe, _but a just_, conception of the\r\n    duties and rights of neutrality appears to be embodied.”[15]\r\n\r\nAn excellent French writer on International Law, Baron de Cussy,\r\nremarks, on mentioning our course with reference to a steamer purchased\r\nby Prussia in its war with Denmark in 1849,--\r\n\r\n    “It affords a genuine proof of respect for the obligations of\r\n    neutrality.”[16]\r\n\r\nAmerican loyalty to neutral duties received the homage of the eminent\r\norator and statesman Mr. Canning, who, from his place in Parliament,\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n    “If I wished for a guide in a system of neutrality, I should\r\n    take that laid down by America in the days of the Presidency of\r\n    Washington and the Secretaryship of Jefferson.”[17]\r\n\r\nThese testimonies may be fitly concluded by the words of Mr. Rush, so\r\nlong our Minister in England, who records with just pride the honor\r\naccorded to our doctrines on neutral duties:--\r\n\r\n    “They are doctrines that will probably receive more and more\r\n    approbation from all nations as time goes on, and continues to\r\n    bring with it, as we may reasonably hope, further meliorations to\r\n    the code of war. They are as replete with international wisdom as\r\n    with American dignity and spirit.…\r\n\r\n    “Come what may in the future, we can never be deprived of this\r\n    inheritance. It is a proud and splendid inheritance.”[18]\r\n\r\nSuch is the great and honest fame already achieved by our Republic\r\nin upholding neutral duties. No victory in our history has conferred\r\nequal renown. Surely you are not ready to forget the precious\r\ninheritance. No, Sir, let us guard it as one of the best possessions\r\nof our common country,--guard it loyally, so that it shall continue\r\nwithout diminution or spot. Here there must be no backward step. Not\r\n_Backward_, but _Forward_, must be our watchword in the march of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am now brought to that other branch of the subject which concerns\r\ndirectly the conduct of our officials; and here my purpose is to\r\nsimplify the question. Therefore I shall avoid details, which have\r\noccupied the Senate for days; and I put aside the apparent discrepancy\r\nbetween the Annual Report of the War Department and the Annual Report\r\nof the Treasurer, which has been satisfactorily explained on this\r\nfloor, so that this ground of inquiry is removed. I bring the case to\r\ncertain heads, which, taken together in their mass, make it impossible\r\nfor us to avoid inquiry, without leaving the Government or some of its\r\nofficials exposed to serious suspicion. Now, as at the beginning, I\r\nmake no accusation against any officer of our Government,--none against\r\nthe President, none against the Secretary of War; but I exhibit reasons\r\nfor the present proceeding.\r\n\r\nThe case naturally opens with the resolution of the Committee of the\r\nFrench Assembly, asking the United States “to furnish the result of the\r\ninquiry into the conduct of American officials who were suspected of\r\nparticipating in the purchase of arms for the French Government during\r\nthe war.” This seems to have been adopted as late as February 9th last\r\npast. At least it appears in the cable dispatch of that date.[19] From\r\nthis resolution three things are manifest: first, that the sale of arms\r\nby our Government is occupying the attention of the French Legislature;\r\nsecondly, that American officials are suspected of participating in the\r\npurchase for the French Government; and, thirdly, that it is supposed\r\nthat our Government has instituted an inquiry into the case.\r\n\r\nThis resolution is, I believe, without precedent. I recall no other\r\ninstance where a foreign legislative assembly has made any inquiry\r\ninto the conduct of the officials of another country. If this were\r\ndone in an inimical or even a critical spirit, it might, perhaps,\r\nbe dismissed with indifference. But France, once in our history an\r\nall-powerful ally, is now a friendly power, with which we are in the\r\nbest relations. Any movement on her part with regard to the conduct of\r\nour officials must be received according to the rules of comity and\r\ngood-will. It cannot be disregarded. It ought to be anticipated. This\r\nresolution alone would justify inquiry on our part.\r\n\r\nPassing to evidence, I come to the telegraphic dispatch of Squire,\r\nson-in-law and agent of Remington, actually addressed in French cipher\r\nto the latter in France, under date of October 8, 1870. Though brief,\r\nit is most important:--\r\n\r\n    “We have _the strongest influences_ working for us, which will use\r\n    all their efforts to succeed.”\r\n\r\nConsidering the writer of this dispatch, his family and business\r\nrelations with Remington, to whom it was addressed, it is difficult\r\nto regard it except as a plain revelation of actual facts. It was\r\nimportant that Remington should know the precise condition of things.\r\nHis son-in-law and agent telegraphs that “the strongest influences”\r\nare at work for them. What can this mean? Surely here is no broker\r\nor arms-merchant, engaged in the course of business. It is something\r\nelse,--plainly something else. What? That is the point for inquiry. Mr.\r\nSquire is an American citizen. Let him be examined and cross-examined,\r\nunder oath. Let him disclose what he meant by “the strongest\r\ninfluences.” He could not have intended to deceive his father-in-law,\r\nand puff himself. He was doubtless in earnest. Did he deceive himself?\r\nOn this he is a witness. But until those words are so far explained\r\nas to show that they do not point to officials, the natural inference\r\nis that it was on them that he relied,--that they were “the strongest\r\ninfluences” by which the job was to be carried through; for, of course,\r\nit was a job which he announced.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted that this dispatch of Mr. Squire by itself alone\r\nis enough to justify inquiry. Without the resolution of the French\r\nAssembly, and without the supplementary testimony to be adduced, it\r\nthrows a painful suspicion upon our officials, which should compel them\r\nto explain.\r\n\r\nBut the letter of Mr. Remington, already adduced,[20] carries this\r\nsuspicion still further, by adding his positive testimony that he\r\ndealt with the Government. Before referring again to this testimony,\r\nit is important to consider the character of the witness; and here we\r\nhave the authentication of the Secretary of War, who has recommended\r\nand indorsed him, in a formal paper to be used in France. Others may\r\nquestion the statements of Mr. Remington, but no person speaking for\r\nthe Secretary will hesitate to accept them. If the testimony of the\r\nSecretary needed support, it would be found in the open declarations\r\non this floor by the Senator from New York [Mr. CONKLING], and in the\r\nfollowing letter, which the Senator dated from the Senate Chamber\r\nduring the recess, when notoriously the Senate was not in session:--\r\n\r\n                                                     “SENATE CHAMBER,\r\n\r\n                               “WASHINGTON, D. C., November 17, 1871.\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR SIR,--I learn with surprise that your personal and\r\n    commercial situation and the good name of the house of Remington &\r\n    Sons have been questioned. Having known your father and sons for\r\n    many years, having lived within a stone-throw, so to say, of your\r\n    house for a number of years, and being one of the Senators of your\r\n    State, I cannot hesitate to give you my testimony relative to the\r\n    accusations that have, as has been told me, been brought against\r\n    you in France.\r\n\r\n    “As to what concerns personal situation, importance of affairs,\r\n    success, solvency, wealth, and fidelity to the Government of the\r\n    United States, your house has for a long time occupied a front\r\n    rank, not only in the State of New York, but also in the Union.\r\n\r\n    “The allegation that you lack experience as a manufacturer of\r\n    arms, or in anything that can, as a man of business, entitle\r\n    you to respect, is, I can affirm in all sincerity, destitute of\r\n    foundation, and must proceed from ignorance or malignity.\r\n\r\n        “Sincerely, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n            “ROSCOE CONKLING.\r\n\r\n    “Mr. SAMUEL REMINGTON.”\r\n\r\nThus does the Senator from New York vouch for the “good name” of Mr.\r\nRemington.\r\n\r\nThus introduced, thus authenticated, and thus indorsed, Mr. Remington\r\ncannot be rejected as a witness, especially when he writes an official\r\nletter to the Chairman of the French Armament Commission at Tours. You\r\nalready know something of that letter, dated at New York, December 13,\r\n1870. My present object is to show how, while announcing his large\r\npurchases of batteries, arms, and cartridges, he speaks of dealing with\r\nGovernment always, and not even with any intermediate agent.\r\n\r\n    MR. CONKLING. Will the Senator allow me there one moment, as he has\r\n    referred to me?\r\n\r\n    MR. SUMNER. Certainly.\r\n\r\n    MR. CONKLING. He is engaged at this point, if I understand him\r\n    aright, in supporting Mr. Remington in his character; and as the\r\n    document from which he made the translation of my letter also\r\n    contains stronger fortification in aid of the Senator and of Mr.\r\n    Remington, I beg to call attention to it. The Senator might refer\r\n    not only to my letter, but to letters written by Governor Hoffman,\r\n    ex-Governor Horatio Seymour, Edwin D. Morgan, late a member of this\r\n    body, General John A. Dix, not unknown here, and other citizens of\r\n    the State of New York, who certify, I believe in somewhat stronger\r\n    terms than those I employed, to the probity and standing of Mr.\r\n    Remington.\r\n\r\nMR. SUMNER. I am obliged to the Senator for the additional testimony\r\nthat he bears. It only fortifies the authority of Mr. Remington,\r\nwhich was my object. I took the liberty of introducing the letter\r\nof the Senator, because he is among us, and had vouched for Mr.\r\nRemington personally. I gladly welcome the additional evidence which\r\nthe Senator introduces. It is entirely in harmony with the case that\r\nI am presenting. I wish to show how Mr. Remington was regarded by\r\nthe Senator, by the Secretary of War, and by other distinguished\r\ncitizens,--so that, when he writes an official letter to the Chairman\r\nof the Arms Committee of Tours, he cannot be rejected as a witness.\r\n\r\nThe letter is long, and early in it the writer alludes to a credit from\r\nFrance and certain instructions with regard to it, saying:--\r\n\r\n    “This we could not do, as a considerable portion had been _already\r\n    paid out to the Government_.”\r\n\r\nThen coming to the purchase of breech-loading Springfield muskets, he\r\nwrites:--\r\n\r\n    “_The Government_ has never made but about seventy-five thousand,\r\n    all told; and forty thousand is the greatest number _they think it\r\n    prudent to spare_.”\r\n\r\nIn order to increase the number he proposed an exchange of his own, and\r\nhere he says:--\r\n\r\n    “This question of an exchange, _with the very friendly feeling I\r\n    find existing to aid France_, I hope to be able to procure more.”\r\n\r\nWhere was “the very friendly feeling existing to aid France”? Not among\r\nmerchants, agents, or brokers. This would hardly justify the important\r\ndeclaration with regard to a feeling which was so efficacious.\r\n\r\nThen comes the question of cartridges; and here the dealings with the\r\nGovernment become still more manifest:--\r\n\r\n    “Cartridges for these forty thousand will in a great measure\r\n    require to be made, as _the Government_ have but about three\r\n    millions on hand. But _the Government_ has consented to allow the\r\n    requisite number, four hundred for each gun, to be made, and the\r\n    cartridge-works have had orders, given yesterday, to increase\r\n    production to the full capacity of works.”\r\n\r\nObserve here, if you please, the part performed by the Government,--not\r\nonly its consent to the manufacture, but the promptitude of this\r\nconsent. This was not easily accomplished, as the well-indorsed witness\r\ntestifies:--\r\n\r\n    “This question of making the cartridges _at the Government works_\r\n    was a difficult one to get over. But it is done.”\r\n\r\nNaturally difficult; but the agent of France overcame all obstacles.\r\nThen as to price:--\r\n\r\n    “The price _the Government_ will charge for the guns and cartridges\r\n    will be ----, or as near that as possible.”\r\n\r\nAlways “the Government”! Then comes another glimpse:--\r\n\r\n    “The forty thousand guns cannot all be shipped immediately, as they\r\n    are distributed _in the various arsenals throughout the country_.”\r\n\r\nThat is, the Government arsenals.\r\n\r\nThen appears one of our officials on the scene:--\r\n\r\n    “_The Chief of Ordnance_ thinks it may take twenty to thirty days\r\n    before all could be brought in.”\r\n\r\nThen again the witness reports:--\r\n\r\n    “_The Chief of Ordnance_ estimates the cost of the arms, including\r\n    boxing and expense of freight to bring them to New York, at $20.60\r\n    currency.”\r\n\r\nThen as to the harness:--\r\n\r\n    “_The Government_ have not full complete sets to the extent of\r\n    twenty-five hundred after selling the number required for the fifty\r\n    batteries.”\r\n\r\nAlways “the Government”!\r\n\r\nThen, after mentioning that some parts of the harness are wanting, he\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n    “I have made arrangements to have this deficiency made good by\r\n    either _the Government_ or by outside persons.”\r\n\r\nBut the Government does all it can:--\r\n\r\n    “In the mean time _the Government_ have ordered the harness to be\r\n    sent here immediately.”\r\n\r\nThen at the close the witness says:--\r\n\r\n    “I forgot to say _the Government_ have no Spencer rifles, having\r\n    never had but a small number, and all of those you have bought.”\r\n\r\nAnd he adds--\r\n\r\n    that “they have from three to four thousand transformed\r\n    Springfields,” which he “may think best to take _after\r\n    examination_,”--\r\n\r\nshowing again his intimate dealings with the Government.\r\n\r\nSuch is the testimony of Mr. Remington, the acknowledged agent of\r\nFrance. It is impossible to read these repeated allusions to “the\r\nGovernment” and “the Chief of Ordnance” without feeling that the\r\nwitness was dealing directly in this quarter. If there was any\r\nmiddleman, he was of straw only; but a man-of-straw is nobody. If Mr.\r\nRemington’s character were not vouched so completely, if he did not\r\nappear on authentic testimony so entirely above any misrepresentation,\r\nif he were not elevated to be the model arms-dealer, this letter, with\r\nits numerous averments of relations with the Government, would be of\r\nless significance. But how can these be denied or explained without\r\nimpeaching this witness?\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Remington is not without important support in his allegations.\r\nHis French correspondent, M. Le Cesne, Chairman of the Armament\r\nCommittee, has testified in open court that the French dealt directly\r\nwith the Government. He may have been mistaken; but his testimony shows\r\nwhat he understood to be the case. The Senator from Missouri [Mr.\r\nSCHURZ] has already called attention to this testimony, which he cited\r\nfrom a journal enjoying great circulation on the European continent,\r\n“L’Indépendance Belge.” The Senator from Vermont, [Mr. EDMUNDS,] not\r\nrecognizing the character of this important journal, distrusted the\r\nreport. But this testimony does not depend upon that journal alone. I\r\nhave it in another journal, “Le Courrier des États-Unis,” of October\r\n27, 1871, evidently copied from a Parisian journal, probably one of the\r\nlaw journals, where it is given according to the formal report of a\r\ntrial, with question and answer:--\r\n\r\n    “THE PRESIDING JUDGE. Did not this indemnity of twenty-five cents\r\n    represent certain material expenses, certain disbursements,\r\n    incidental expenses?\r\n\r\n    “M. LE CESNE. We could not admit these expenses; _for we had an\r\n    agreement with the American Federal Government, which had engaged\r\n    to deliver free on board all the arms on account of France_.”\r\n\r\nNow I make no comment on this testimony except to remark that it is in\r\nentire harmony with the letter of Mr. Remington, and that beyond all\r\ndoubt it was given in open court under oath, and duly reported in the\r\ntrial, so as to become known generally in Europe. The position of M. Le\r\nCesne gave it authority; for, beside his recent experience as Chairman\r\nof the Arms Committee, he is known as a former representative in the\r\nAssembly from the large town of Havre, and also a resident for twenty\r\nyears in the United States. In confirmation of the value attached to\r\nthis testimony, I mention that my attention was first directed to it by\r\nHon. Gustavus Koerner, of Illinois, Minister of the United States at\r\nMadrid, under President Lincoln.\r\n\r\nTo this cumulative testimony I add that already supplied by our\r\nMinister at Berlin, under date of January 7, 1871, and published by\r\nthe Department of State, where it is distinctly said that “recently\r\nrifled cannon and ammunition have been furnished to the French in\r\nenormous quantities, not only by private American traders, _but by\r\nthe War Department at Washington_.” This I have already adduced under\r\nanother head.[21] It is mentioned now to show how the public knowledge\r\nof Europe was in harmony with the other evidence.\r\n\r\nThere is another piece of testimony, which serves to quicken suspicion.\r\nIt is already admitted by the Secretary of War, that, after refusing\r\nMr. Remington because he was an agent of France, bids were accepted\r\nfrom Thomas Richardson, who was in point of fact an attorney-at-law\r\nat Ilion, and agent and attorney of Mr. Remington. But the course of\r\nMr. Remington, and his relations with this country attorney, are not\r\nwithout official illustration. Since this debate began I have received\r\na copy of a law journal of Paris, “Le Droit, Journal des Tribunaux,”\r\nof January 18, 1872, containing the most recent judicial proceedings\r\nagainst the French Consul-General at New York. Here I find an official\r\nreport from the acting French Consul there, addressed to the French\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, under date of August 25, 1871, where a\r\nfact is described which was authenticated at the Consulate, being an\r\naffidavit or deposition before a notary by a clerk of Mr. Remington, on\r\nwhich the report remarks:--\r\n\r\n    “This declaration establishing that this manufacturer caused the\r\n    books of his house to be recopied three times, and in doing so\r\n    altered the original form.”\r\n\r\nThe Report adds:--\r\n\r\n    “It is in this document that mention is made of the character, I\r\n    might say criminal, which the name of Richardson appears to have\r\n    assumed in the affairs of Mr. Remington.”\r\n\r\nAfter remarking that the witness who has thus testified has exposed\r\nhimself to the penalties of perjury, being several years of\r\nimprisonment, the Report proceeds:--\r\n\r\n    “You see from this that the operations of Mr. Remington give only\r\n    too much of a glimpse of the most audacious frauds.”\r\n\r\nHere is testimony tending at least to stimulate inquiry: Mr.\r\nRemington’s books altered three times, and the name of Richardson\r\nplaying a criminal part. I quote this from an official document, and\r\nleave it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere, then, are six different sources of testimony, all prompting\r\ninquiry: first, the resolution of a committee of the French Assembly,\r\nshowing suspicion of American officials; secondly, the cable dispatch\r\nof Squire, son-in-law and agent of Mr. Remington, declaring that “we\r\nhave the strongest influences working for us, which will use all their\r\nefforts to succeed”; thirdly, the letter of Mr. Remington, reporting,\r\nin various forms and repetitions, that he is dealing with the American\r\nGovernment; fourthly, the testimony of M. Le Cesne, the Chairman of\r\nthe French Armament Committee, made in open court and under oath, that\r\nthe French “had an agreement with the American Federal Government,\r\nwhich had engaged to deliver free on board all the arms on account\r\nof France”; fifthly, the positive declaration of the London “Times”\r\nin the face of Europe, and reported by our Minister at Berlin, that\r\nrifled cannon and ammunition had been furnished to the French in\r\nenormous quantities by the War Department at Washington; and, sixthly,\r\nthe testimony of a clerk of Mr. Remington, authenticated by the French\r\nConsul-General at New York, that Mr. Remington had altered his books\r\nthree times, and also speaking of the criminal character of Richardson\r\nin the affairs of Mr. Remington. On this cumulative and concurring\r\ntestimony from six different sources is it not plain that there must\r\nbe inquiry? The Senate cannot afford to close its eyes. The resolution\r\nof the committee of the French Assembly alone would be enough; but\r\nreinforced as it is from so many different quarters, the case is\r\nirresistible. Not to inquire is to set at defiance all rules of decency\r\nand common-sense.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo these successive reasons I add the evidence, which has been much\r\ndiscussed, showing a violation of the statute authorizing the sale of\r\n“the old cannon, arms, and other ordnance stores, now in possession\r\nof the War Department, which are damaged or otherwise unsuitable for\r\nthe United States military service or for the militia of the United\r\nStates,”[22]--inasmuch as stores were sold which were not “damaged”\r\nor “otherwise unsuitable.” I think no person can have heard the\r\ndebate without admitting that here at least is something for careful\r\ninvestigation. The Senator from Missouri has already exposed this\r\napparent dereliction of duty, which in its excess ended in actually\r\ndisarming the country, so as to impair its defensive capacity. One of\r\nthe crimes of the Cabinet of Mr. Buchanan on the eve of the Rebellion\r\nwas that the North had been disarmed. It is important to consider\r\nwhether, in the strange greed for money or in the misfeasance of\r\nsubordinates, something similar was not done when good arms were sold\r\nto France. The Chief of Ordnance, in his last Annual Report, which will\r\nbe found in the Report of the Secretary of War, makes the following\r\nstatement:--\r\n\r\n    “Now there are less than ten thousand breech-loading muskets in the\r\n    arsenals for issue. This number of muskets is not half sufficient\r\n    to supply the States with the muskets they are now entitled to\r\n    receive under their apportionment of the permanent appropriation\r\n    for arming and equipping the militia.”\r\n\r\nWhy, then, were breech-loading muskets exchanged for French gold? The\r\nChief of Ordnance then proceeds:--\r\n\r\n    “This Department should, as soon as possible, be placed in a\r\n    condition to fill all proper requisitions by the States upon\r\n    it, and should also have on hand in store a large number of\r\n    breech-loading muskets and carbines to meet any emergency that may\r\n    arise.”\r\n\r\nBut these very breech-loading muskets have gone to France. The Chief of\r\nOrdnance adds:--\r\n\r\n    “Ten years ago the country felt that not less than a million of\r\n    muskets should be kept in store in the arsenals.”[23]\r\n\r\nWhy was not this remembered, when the arsenals were stripped to supply\r\nFrance?\r\n\r\nThis important testimony speaks for itself. It is not sufficient to\r\nrecount against it the arms actually in the national arsenals. The\r\nChief of Ordnance answers the allegation by his own statements. He\r\nregrets the small number of breech-loading muskets on hand, and refers\r\nas an example to the standard ten years ago, when it was felt that a\r\nmillion of muskets should be kept in store. It is not I who say this;\r\nit is the Chief of Ordnance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut these several considerations, while making inquiry imperative, do\r\nnot touch the money question involved. If in the asserted dealings\r\nwith a belligerent power, in violation of our neutral duties, there\r\nis reason to believe corrupt practices of any kind, if there are\r\nlarge sums of money that seem to be unaccounted for, then is there\r\nadditional ground for inquiry. Two questions are presented: first, as\r\nto the violation of neutral duties; and, secondly, as to misfeasance of\r\nsubordinates involving money. In both cases the question, I repeat, is\r\nof inquiry.\r\n\r\nI do not dwell now on the sums lost by France in this business. They\r\nare supposed to count by the million; but here I make no allegation. I\r\nallude only to what appears elsewhere.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably there are enormous discrepancies between the sums paid\r\nby France for arms actually identified as coming from our arsenals and\r\nthe sums received by our Ordnance Bureau. In different reports these\r\ndiscrepancies assume different forms. Not to repeat what has been said\r\non other occasions, I introduce the report of the acting French Consul\r\nat New York, dated August 25, 1871, where, after showing that France\r\nreceived only 368,000 muskets and 53,000,000 cartridges, while the\r\naccounts with Mr. Remington enumerate a sum-total of 425,000 arms and\r\n54,000,000 cartridges, it is said:--\r\n\r\n     “Whence comes this difference of 57,000 between the arms said to\r\n    be sent from here and those which were received in France, if in\r\n    fact the report of M. Riant signifies that they have only received\r\n    a total of 368,000? How explain that there were 425,000 put on the\r\n    bills of lading, and that the price of these was paid in New York?”\r\n\r\nNow this discrepancy may be traced exclusively to French agents, so\r\nthat our subordinates shall not in any way be involved; but when we\r\nconsider all the circumstances of this transaction, it affords grounds\r\nof inquiry.\r\n\r\nBut there is another witness on this head, not before mentioned in\r\nthis debate. I have here an extract from the official report of M. de\r\nBellonet, the French _Chargé d’Affaires_ at Washington, made to his\r\nGovernment on this very question of losses down to a certain period.\r\nHis language is explicit: “The _dry loss_ to the Treasury of France\r\nmust have been about $1,500,000, or seven million francs.” This, be\r\nit remembered, is only a partial report down to a certain period. Now\r\nthere is nothing in this report to charge this “dry loss” upon our\r\nofficials. It may be that it was all absorbed by the intermediate\r\nagents. But taken in connection with the telegram of Squire and the\r\nabundant letter of Mr. Remington, it leaves a suspicion at least\r\nadverse to our officials.\r\n\r\nSir, let me be understood. I do not believe that any inquiry by any\r\ncommittee can give back to France any of the enormous sums she has\r\nlost. They have already gone beyond recall into the portentous mass\r\nof her terrible sacrifices destined to be an indefinite mortgage on\r\nthat interesting country. Not for the sake of France or of any French\r\nclaimant do I propose inquiry, but for our sake, for the sake of our\r\nown country. We read of that vast Serbonian bog “where armies whole\r\nhave sunk.” It is important to know if there is any such bog anywhere\r\nabout our Ordnance Office, where millions whole have sunk.\r\n\r\nInvestigation is the order of the day. Already in France, amid all\r\nthe anxieties of her distracted condition, these purchases of arms\r\nhave occupied much attention. As far back as last April, the “Soir,”\r\na journal at Versailles, where the Convention was sitting, called for\r\nparliamentary inquiry. Its language was strong:--\r\n\r\n    “A parliamentary inquiry made in full day can alone establish\r\n    either the culpability of some or the perfect honorableness of\r\n    others.”\r\n\r\nAnd the same French organ added:--\r\n\r\n    “The Chamber, in consigning this matter to its pigeonholes, refused\r\n    satisfaction to an awakened public morality.”\r\n\r\nThere is, then, in France an awakened public morality, as we hope there\r\nis also in the United States, which demands investigation where there\r\nis suspicion of corrupt practices. The French Chamber has instituted\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. President, as a Republic, we are bound to the most strenuous\r\ncare, so that our example may not in any way suffer. If we fail, then\r\ndoes Republican Government everywhere feel the shock. For the sake of\r\nothers as well as of ourselves must we guard our conduct. How often do\r\nI insist that we cannot at any moment, or in any transaction, forget\r\nthese great responsibilities! As no man “liveth to himself,” so no\r\nnation “liveth” to itself; especially is this the condition of the\r\nGreat Republic. By the very name it bears, and by its lofty dedication\r\nto the rights of human nature, is it vowed to all those things which\r\ncontribute most to civilization, keeping its example always above\r\nsuspicion. That great political philosopher, Montesquieu, announces\r\nthat the animating sentiment of Monarchy is “Honor,” but the animating\r\nsentiment of a Republic is “Virtue.”[24] I would gladly accept this\r\nflattering distinction. Therefore, in the name of that Virtue which\r\nshould inspire our Government and keep it forever above all suspicion,\r\ndo I move this inquiry.\r\n\r\nOn this whole matter the Senate will act as it thinks best, ordering\r\nthat investigation which the case requires. For myself I have but\r\none desire, which is, that this effort, begun in the discharge of a\r\npatriotic duty, may redound to the good of our country, and especially\r\nto the purity of the public service.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n(A.) Page 15.\r\n\r\nAUTHORITIES REFERRED TO IN SPEECH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWheaton, our great authority, in Lawrence’s edition, page 727, quotes\r\nVattel as laying down the rule of neutrality:--\r\n\r\n    “To give no assistance where there is no previous stipulation to\r\n    give it; nor voluntarily to furnish troops, arms, ammunition, or\r\n    anything of direct use in war.”\r\n\r\nVattel, as quoted, then says:--\r\n\r\n    “I do not say, _To give assistance equally_, but, _To give no\r\n    assistance_; for it would be absurd that a State should assist at\r\n    the same time two enemies.”--_Le Droit des Gens_, Liv. III. ch.\r\n    vii. § 104.\r\n\r\nAnother home authority, the late General Halleck, in his work on\r\nInternational Law, after speaking of merchants engaged in selling\r\nships and munitions of war to a belligerent, says:--\r\n\r\n    “The act is wrong in itself, and the penalty results from his\r\n    violation of moral duty as well as of law. The duties imposed upon\r\n    the citizens and subjects flow from exactly the same principle as\r\n    those which attach to the government of neutral States.”\r\n\r\nHe then says, quoting another:--\r\n\r\n    “By these acts he makes himself personally a party to a war in\r\n    which, as a neutral, he had no right to engage, and his property is\r\n    justly treated as that of an enemy.”--_International Law_, p. 631.\r\n\r\nOur other home authority, Professor Woolsey, in his work on\r\nInternational Law, section 162, says:--\r\n\r\n    “International Law does not require of the neutral sovereign\r\n    that he should keep the citizen or subject within the same\r\n    strict lines of neutrality which he is bound to draw for\r\n    himself.”--_Introduction to the Study of International Law_, 2d\r\n    edition, p. 270.\r\n\r\nThat is, a citizen may sell ships and arms to a belligerent and take\r\nthe penalty, but the Government cannot do any such thing.\r\n\r\nAnother authority of considerable weight, Bluntschli, the German, lays\r\ndown the rule as follows:--\r\n\r\n    “The neutral State must neither send troops to a belligerent, nor\r\n    put ships of war at its disposal, nor furnish subsidies to aid it\r\n    in making the war.\r\n\r\n    “In coming _directly_ to the aid of one of the belligerent powers\r\n    by the sending of men or war material, one takes part in the\r\n    war.”--_Droit International Codifié_, tr. LARDY, art. 757, p. 381.\r\n\r\nThere is the true principle: “By the sending of men or war material one\r\ntakes part in the war.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut the most important illustration of this question, and the only case\r\nbearing directly on this point, which, according to my recollection,\r\nhas ever been diplomatically discussed, is one somewhat famous at the\r\ntime, known as that of the Swedish Frigate, which will be found in the\r\nsecond series of “Causes Célèbres,” by Baron Charles de Martens.\r\n\r\nIt seems that in 1825, after ten years of peace, the Swedish Government\r\nconceived the idea of parting with ships, some of them more than twenty\r\nyears old, as comparatively useless. A contract for their sale was made\r\nwith a commercial house in London. The Spanish Government, by their\r\nminister at Stockholm, protested, on the alleged ground, that, though\r\nnominally sold to merchants, they were purchased for the revolted\r\ncolonies in Mexico and South America, and in his communication, dated\r\nthe 1st of July, 1825, used the following energetic language, which I\r\ntranslate:--\r\n\r\n    “And what would his Majesty the King of Sweden think, on the\r\n    supposition of the revolt of one of his provinces,--of the kingdom\r\n    of Norway for example,--if friendly and allied powers furnished the\r\n    rebels with arms, munitions, a fleet even, through intermediate\r\n    speculators, and under pretence of not knowing the result--\r\n\r\nI translate literally,--\r\n\r\n    “intermediate speculators, and under pretence of not knowing the\r\n    result? Informed of these preparations, would the Cabinet of\r\n    Stockholm wait till the steel and the cannon furnished to its\r\n    enemies had mown down its soldiers, till the vessels delivered to\r\n    the rebels had annihilated its commerce and desolated its coasts,\r\n    to protest against similar supplies, and to prevent them if\r\n    possible? And if the protests were rejected, independently of every\r\n    other measure, would it not raise its voice throughout Europe, and\r\n    at the courts of all its allies, against this _act of hostility_,\r\n    against this violation of the rights of sovereignty, and against\r\n    this _political scandal_?”--_Causes Célèbres_, Tom. II. pp. 472-73.\r\n\r\nThese are strong words, but they only give expression to the feelings\r\nnaturally awakened in a Power that seemed to be imperilled by such an\r\nact.\r\n\r\nIn another communication the same minister said to the Swedish\r\nGovernment:--\r\n\r\n    “It is the doctrine of irresponsibility which the Cabinet of\r\n    Stockholm professes with regard to the sale of these war vessels,\r\n    which excites the most lively representations on the part of the\r\n    undersigned.”--_Note of 15 July 1825_: Ibid., p. 480.\r\n\r\nMark the words, “the doctrine of irresponsibility.” Then, again, the\r\nminister says in other words worthy of consideration at this moment:--\r\n\r\n    “The Swedish Government on this occasion, creating this new kind\r\n    of commerce, determined to furnish ships of war indiscriminately\r\n    to every purchaser, even to private individuals without\r\n    guaranty,--establishing, as it seems to indicate, that the\r\n    commercial benefits of these sales are for the State a necessity of\r\n    an order superior to political considerations the most elevated, as\r\n    to moral obligations the most respectable.”--_Note of 9 September,\r\n    1825_: Ibid., p. 486.\r\n\r\nI ask if these words are not applicable to the present case? Did it\r\nnot become the Government of the United States at this time, when\r\nmaking these large sales, almost gigantic, so that its suspicion was\r\nnecessarily aroused, to institute inquiry into the real character of\r\nthe purchaser? Was it not put on its guard? Every morning told us of\r\nwar unhappily raging in Europe. Could there be doubt that these large\r\npurchases were for the benefit of one of the belligerents? Was our\r\nGovernment so situated that for the sake of these profits it would\r\nneglect political considerations called in this dispatch the most\r\nelevated, as moral obligations the most respectable? Was it ready to\r\nassume the responsibility characterized by the Spanish minister in a\r\ncase less plain, as “an act of hostility,” a “violation of the rights\r\nof sovereignty,” a “political scandal”?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARY LAW ON THE APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEES OF THE\r\nSENATE.\r\n\r\nTWO PROTESTS AGAINST THE COMPETENCY OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE TO\r\nINVESTIGATE THE SALE OF ARMS TO FRANCE; MARCH 26 AND 27, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n    March 26, 1872, Mr. Sumner appeared before the Committee to\r\n    investigate the sale of arms by the United States during the French\r\n    and German War, in response to a communication signed by the\r\n    chairman of the Committee requesting his attendance. After reading\r\n    this communication, Mr. Sumner proceeded to read and file a protest\r\n    in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTEST.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I object to no examination. Willingly would I submit to the\r\nmost searching scrutiny, not only in the present case, but in all my\r\npublic life. There is not an act, letter, or conversation at any time,\r\nthat I would save from investigation. I make this statement, because I\r\nwould not have the protest I deem it my duty to offer open to suspicion\r\nthat there is anything I desire to conceal or any examination I would\r\navoid.\r\n\r\nBut appearing before the Committee on an invitation which is in the\r\nnature of a summons, to testify in the investigation originally moved\r\nby me into the sale of arms to France, I am obliged to consider\r\nmy duty as a Senator. Personal inclinations, whatever they may be,\r\ncannot be my guide. I must do what belongs to a Senator under the\r\ncircumstances of the case.\r\n\r\nBefore answering any questions, I am constrained to consider the\r\ncompetency of the Committee which has summoned me. It is of less\r\nimportance what these questions may be, although there are certain\r\nobvious limitations, to which I will allude at the outset.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe examination of a Senator by a Committee of the Senate on a matter\r\noutside of the Senate, and not connected with his public duties, is\r\nsustained by precedents,--as when Mr. Seward and Mr. Wilson were\r\nexamined with reference to the expedition of John Brown;[25] but any\r\nexamination with regard to his public conduct, and especially with\r\nregard to a matter which he has felt it his duty to lay before the\r\nSenate in the discharge of his public duties, is of very doubtful\r\npropriety. In his public conduct a Senator acts on his responsibility,\r\nunder sanction of an oath, and the Constitution declares that “for any\r\nspeech or debate” he “shall not be questioned in any other place.” This\r\ninhibition, while not preventing questions of a certain character,\r\nmust limit the inquiry; but the law steps forward with its own\r\nrequirements, according to which it is plain that a Senator cannot be\r\ninterrogated, first, with regard to his conference with other Senators\r\non public business, and, secondly, with regard to witnesses who have\r\nconfidentially communicated with him.\r\n\r\nReferring to the most approved work on the Law of Evidence,--I mean\r\nthat of Professor Greenleaf,--we find under the head of “Evidence\r\nexcluded from Public Policy”[26] at least four different classes of\r\ncases, which may enlighten us in determining the questions proper for\r\nSenators.\r\n\r\n1. Communications between a lawyer and client. And are not the\r\nrelations of Senators, in the discharge of their public duties, equally\r\nsacred?\r\n\r\n2. Judges and arbitrators enjoy a similar exemption with regard to\r\nmatters before them.\r\n\r\n3. Grand jurors, embracing even the clerk and prosecuting officer,\r\ncannot be examined on matters before them.\r\n\r\n4. Transactions between the heads of Departments and their subordinate\r\nofficers are treated as confidential.\r\n\r\nPlainly, the conferences of a Senator, in the discharge of his public\r\nduties, cannot be less protected.\r\n\r\nThis rule is equally imperative with regard to witnesses who have\r\nconfidentially communicated with a Senator. Here again I quote\r\nProfessor Greenleaf, who quotes the eminent English judge of the close\r\nof the last century, Lord Chief-Justice Eyre, as follows:--\r\n\r\n    “There is a rule which has universally obtained on account of its\r\n    importance to the public for the detection of crimes, that those\r\n    persons who are the channel by means of which that detection is\r\n    made should not be unnecessarily disclosed.”[27]\r\n\r\nThen the learned professor proceeds:--\r\n\r\n    “All were of opinion that all those questions which tend to the\r\n    discovery of the channels by which the disclosure was made to\r\n    the officers of justice were, upon the general principles of the\r\n    convenience of public justice, to be suppressed; that all persons\r\n    in that situation were protected from the discovery.”[28]\r\n\r\nThese words are explicit, and nobody can question them.\r\n\r\nI am led to make these remarks and adduce these authorities because,\r\nperusing the testimony of Mr. Schurz, I find that he was interrogated\r\non these very matters; and since I, too, am summoned as a witness,\r\nI desire to put on record my sense of the impropriety of such\r\nquestions. It is important that they should not become a precedent.\r\nAnd here again I declare that I have nothing to conceal, nothing\r\nthat I would not willingly give to the world under any examination\r\nand cross-examination; but I am unwilling to aid in the overthrow\r\nof a rule of law which stands on unquestionable grounds of public\r\npolicy. Especially is it important in the Senate, where, without\r\nsuch protection, a tyrannical majority might deter a minority from\r\noriginating unwelcome inquiries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom these preliminaries I proceed to consider the competency of the\r\npresent Committee. Requested as a Senator to appear before you, I deem\r\nit my duty to protest against the formation and constitution of the\r\nCommittee as contrary to unquestionable requirements of Parliamentary\r\nLaw; and I ask the Committee to receive this protest as my answer to\r\ntheir letter of invitation. I make this more readily because in my\r\nspeech in the Senate, February 28, 1872, entitled “Reform and Purity in\r\nGovernment, Neutral Duties, Sale of Arms to Belligerent France,”[29]\r\nI have set forth what moved me to the inquiry, being grounds of\r\nsuspicion, which, in my judgment, rendered the most searching inquiry\r\nby a committee friendly to inquiry absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nThe general parliamentary rule in the appointment of special committees\r\nrequires that they should be organized so as to promote the business\r\nor inquiry for which the committee is created. This requirement\r\nis according to obvious reason, and is sustained by parliamentary\r\nauthorities. In familiar language, a proposition is committed to its\r\nfriends and not to its enemies.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of this rule, we are told that members who have spoken\r\ndirectly against what is called “the body of the bill,” meaning, of\r\ncourse, the substance of the inquiry, are not expected to serve on the\r\ncommittee, but, should they be so nominated, to decline. Their presence\r\non a committee is not unlike participation in a trial by a judge or\r\njuror interested in the result.\r\n\r\nVery little reflection shows how natural is this rule as an instrument\r\nof justice. The friends of a measure, or the promoters of an inquiry,\r\nthough in the majority on a committee, can do no more than adduce\r\nevidence that exists, so that the business cannot suffer through\r\nthem,--while those unfriendly to a measure, or hostile to an inquiry,\r\nmay, from lukewarmness, or neglect, or possible prejudice, fail to\r\npresent the proper evidence or recognize its just value, so that the\r\nbusiness will suffer. In legislation, plainly, those who believe an\r\ninquiry necessary are the most proper persons to conduct it, and being\r\nso, they are selected by Parliamentary Law.\r\n\r\nThis rule may be traced in the history of Parliament anterior to the\r\nsettlement of our country. The ancient statement was simply that “those\r\nagainst the bill should not be on the committee.” The meaning of the\r\nrule is distinctly seen in historic cases, which I proceed to adduce.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons, as far back as November 7, 1601, in the\r\nreign of Queen Elizabeth, on the commitment of a bill relating to\r\nmisdemeanors, the entry in the Journal mentions that it was delivered\r\nto a certain member, and then says, “and Mr. Serjeant Harris to be\r\n_exempted out of the Committee_, because he spake against the body of\r\nthe Bill,” according to the ancient order in Parliament.[30] In other\r\nwords, a speech against a measure disqualified the learned member, so\r\nthat, according to the expressive words, he was “exempted out of the\r\nCommittee.”\r\n\r\nAgain, in the case of the commitment of a bill affecting the city of\r\nLondon, which came up November 11, 1601, on the question whether the\r\nmembers for London, known to be against the bill, could be of the\r\nCommittee, the rule of the House was stated in these positive words:\r\n“That those against the Bill should be no Committees.” Of course, this\r\nrule was not merely of _form_, but of _substance_. It meant that those\r\nreally against the measure were not proper for the Committee, all of\r\nwhich appeared in the recorded debate and proceedings that ensued. A\r\nleading member, Mr. Wiseman, said:--\r\n\r\n    “The House allowing of this Bill to be committed are, in my\r\n    opinion, to _disallow_ any that will be against the Body of the\r\n    Bill for being Committees.”\r\n\r\nSir Edward Hobby followed:--\r\n\r\n    “And for my own opinion, I think that he that is against the Body\r\n    of the Bill can be no Committee.”\r\n\r\nThe report then proceeds:--\r\n\r\n     “Then the Speaker stood up and said, ‘… All that will have a man\r\n    that hath been against the Body of the Bill to be a Committee, let\r\n    them show their opinions by saying _Yea_.’ And not one said _Yea_.\r\n    ‘All that will not, say _No_.’ And all said _No_.”\r\n\r\nI take this important precedent from Townshend’s “Historical\r\nCollections: or, An Exact Account of the Proceedings of the Four Last\r\nParliaments of Q. Elizabeth,” pp. 208, 209. The same account is found\r\nalso in D’Ewes’s “Journals of all the Parliaments during the Reign of\r\nQueen Elizabeth,” pp. 634-35.\r\n\r\nThus, on submission of the question by the Speaker, the House\r\nunanimously decided that they would “not have a man that hath been\r\nagainst the Body of the Bill to be a Committee.” According to the\r\nreport, “All said _No_”; and that unanimous “No” is the voice of\r\nParliamentary Law, repeated ever since. The phrase “against the Body\r\nof the Bill” is strong and suggestive, showing the purpose to exclude\r\nthose who were unfriendly to the measure.\r\n\r\nFollowing the history of the rule, we meet it again, as stated by\r\nHakewel in his “Modus tenendi Parliamentum,” published in 1671:--\r\n\r\n    “He that speaketh directly against the body of the bill may not\r\n    be named a committee; for he that would totally destroy will not\r\n    amend.”[31]\r\n\r\nHere again is the declared purpose to save the measure from the hands\r\nof enemies.\r\n\r\nThen follows a case remarkable for words which have become familiar\r\nin Parliamentary Law. It was that of Colonel Birch, who, February 11,\r\n1677, brought into Parliament a Bill for Settling a Public Register for\r\nLands in the several Counties, and in his remarks said:--\r\n\r\n    “I begged you formerly _not to put the child to a nurse that cared\r\n    not for it_. For it was formerly committed to two lawyers, and the\r\n    thing was lost.”[32]\r\n\r\nHere the commitment of a bill for reform in law to “two lawyers” was\r\ncondemned, because they were a nurse that did not care for it; and the\r\ncasual remark of the author of the bill has become historical. There\r\nis good law as well as sense in his saying, that a child is not put\r\nto a nurse that cares not for it. Parliamentary Law, in the creation\r\nof special committees, always seeks those who care for the business,\r\nwhatever it may be. One against an inquiry, or believing that there is\r\nno occasion for it, is repudiated by this rule, so just and benign, and\r\nalso so venerable with years.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of articles of impeachment against the Earl of Danby,\r\nLord High Treasurer in the reign of Charles the Second, December 21,\r\n1678, presented the same rule in another aspect. It was no longer a\r\nbill, but an inquiry or investigation, when the Speaker said:--\r\n\r\n    “No man, by the ancient rules of the House, is to be of a committee\r\n    of a _thing_ he is against.”[33]\r\n\r\nHere the language is somewhat broadened, though in entire keeping with\r\nthe other cases. A man cannot be on a committee “of a _thing_ he is\r\nagainst.” In other words, if he is against the inquiry for which a\r\ncommittee is created, he cannot be on it. And here again good faith\r\nrequires that the rule should be observed not merely in form, but in\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nThese cases were analyzed and adopted by Mr. Jefferson in his\r\nauthoritative “Manual”; so that they have become American Parliamentary\r\nLaw, as obligatory here as in England. Speaking always by their\r\nessential reason, but with the weight of precedent also, they are not\r\nless binding than if promulgated with an enacting clause.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson furnishes other and most important words of his own:--\r\n\r\n    “And when any member who is against the bill hears himself named of\r\n    its committee, _he ought to ask to be excused_.”[34]\r\n\r\nThis is the language of our Manual, declaring the duty of a member\r\nwho hears himself named of a committee on a bill he is against. Of\r\ncourse the general rule is applicable to any other matter referred\r\nto a committee. The words are, “he _ought_ to ask to be excused.” Of\r\ncourse his continuance on the committee, or any attempt to exercise its\r\nduties, is a violation of Parliamentary Law, unless you are ready to\r\ndiscard this positive injunction.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson then adds, by way of illustration:--\r\n\r\n    “Thus, March 7, 1606, Mr. Hadley was, on the question being put,\r\n    excused from being of a committee, declaring himself to be against\r\n    the matter itself.”[35]\r\n\r\nAnd our great authority declares that this is “a constant rule.”[36]\r\n\r\nSuch is Parliamentary Law; and Mr. Jefferson has answered in advance\r\nthe possible objection, that this is English and not American. After\r\nsaying, in his preface to the “Manual,” that the Senate has given to\r\nthese rules “the sanction of their approbation,” he announces “the\r\nlaw of proceedings in the Senate as composed of the precepts of the\r\nConstitution, the regulations of the Senate, and, where these are\r\nsilent, of _the rules of Parliament_.” Such, according to him, is\r\nthe law of our proceedings. The “Manual” which he presents he hopes\r\nothers may fill up, “_till a code of rules_ shall be formed for the\r\nuse of the Senate, the effects of which may be accuracy in business,\r\neconomy of time, order, uniformity, and impartiality.” The last word is\r\n“_impartiality_,” which, doubtless, is a main object to be secured.\r\n\r\nAny one disposed to neglect these rules will find a warning from Mr.\r\nJefferson. In his opening chapter he quotes these words from the famous\r\nSpeaker Onslow:--\r\n\r\n    “That these forms, as instituted by our ancestors, operated as a\r\n    check and control on the actions of the majority, and that they\r\n    were in many instances a shelter and _protection to the minority\r\n    against the attempts of power_.”\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson follows this quotation by declaring “the forms and rules\r\nof proceeding” to be “the only weapons by which the minority can defend\r\nthemselves,” and by which “the weaker party can be protected from those\r\nirregularities and abuses which these forms were intended to check, and\r\nwhich the wantonness of power is but too often apt to suggest to large\r\nand successful majorities.”\r\n\r\nThus is the parliamentary rule which forbids a person unfriendly to the\r\nbusiness of the committee, whatever it may be, whether bill or inquiry,\r\nfrom serving on the committee, one of those inhibitions by which public\r\nbusiness is promoted, by which impartiality is secured, and especially\r\nby which a minority is shielded against the wantonness of power.\r\n\r\n“The Congressional Globe” makes it easy to apply what has been said to\r\nseveral of this Committee. Unless the law, as illustrated by ancient\r\ncases, and adopted by Mr. Jefferson, is entirely neglected, unless\r\nthe rule so frequently enunciated is set at defiance or treated as a\r\nsham, there are at least three serving on the Committee in violation\r\nof Parliamentary Law. In undertaking to serve, they were undoubtedly\r\noblivious of the time-honored requirement, or did not appreciate its\r\nstringency.\r\n\r\nNot only every Senator, but the whole country has an immeasurable\r\ninterest in the preservation of those rules by which what Mr. Jefferson\r\njustly calls “the wantonness of power” is restrained, and minorities\r\nare protected against majorities. Any shock to them, as in the present\r\ncase, becomes a precedent by which liberty and justice suffer. As a\r\nSenator appearing before this Committee at their request, I deem it my\r\nduty to file this Protest, in the sincere hope, that, whatever may be\r\nthe result of the present inquiry, the open violation of Parliamentary\r\nLaw in the formation and constitution of the Committee will not be\r\npermitted to become a precedent hereafter. When law is sacrificed,\r\nindividuals may for a moment seem to triumph, but it is at the cost of\r\na great safeguard for the good of all.\r\n\r\nCHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\nSENATE CHAMBER, March 26, 1872.\r\n\r\n    On motion of Mr. Carpenter, of the Committee, it was ordered that\r\n    a subpœna in regular form be issued to Mr. Sumner, returnable the\r\n    next day, to be served by the Sergeant-at-Arms; which was duly\r\n    issued and served.\r\n\r\n    March 27th, Mr. Sumner appeared, and, after the reading of the\r\n    subpœna, proceeded to read a second Protest.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND PROTEST.\r\n\r\nSince reading and filing my Protest yesterday, I have received by the\r\nhands of the Sergeant-at-Arms a subpœna commanding me to appear before\r\nthis Committee. In answer to this subpœna, I now appear.\r\n\r\nIt is my duty to declare that my judgment as originally set forth in my\r\nProtest is in no respect altered by this subpœna. I do not think the\r\nCommittee more competent to-day than yesterday. I still find several\r\noccupying seats on the Committee in violation of an unquestionable rule\r\nof Parliamentary Law. The record shows that they signalized themselves\r\nin the Senate by open speech against the pending inquiry and those who\r\nbrought it forward, or, according to the language of the old rule,\r\n“against the thing,” and therefore disqualified themselves as much as a\r\njudge who has been counsel in a case, or a juror who has declared his\r\nopinion beforehand. This disqualification is not founded on argument\r\nor inference, but on peremptory rule, traced back many generations,\r\nillustrated by numerous authorities, and constituting part of what Mr.\r\nJefferson calls the “code” for the government of the Senate, having, as\r\nhe says, “the sanction of their approbation.”\r\n\r\nBesides the authorities which I cited yesterday, there are two others\r\nfrom our own country, which I deem it my duty to adduce. The first\r\nis that of Cushing’s “Lex Parliamentaria Americana” or “The Law and\r\nPractice of Legislative Assemblies in the United States.” Here we\r\nlearn how completely a committee is placed by Parliamentary Law in the\r\nhands of the mover, thus:--\r\n\r\n    “It became the established practice for the member upon whose\r\n    motion a committee had been ordered, to move the names of the\r\n    members to compose it,--being, of course, of his own selection:\r\n    his own name being among them, and perhaps the first named on the\r\n    list. If he felt any delicacy in moving his own name, the motion\r\n    might be made by some friend: as on the occasion of the appointment\r\n    of the committee to prepare articles of impeachment against Lord\r\n    Melville, which had been ordered on the motion of Mr. Whitbread,\r\n    that gentleman was first appointed one of the committee on the\r\n    motion of Lord Temple, and then on the motion of Mr. Whitbread\r\n    the other members of the committee (Lord Temple being one) were\r\n    appointed.”[37]\r\n\r\nAs this was a case of investigation, it is a precedent for us now. But\r\nour Committee was constituted in a very different manner. Mr. Cushing\r\nvindicates the practice of allowing the mover of a proposition himself\r\nto nominate the committee for the consideration of the House, saying:--\r\n\r\n    “That the House, by adopting the resolution for the committee, has\r\n    signified its willingness that the subject should be so considered\r\n    or investigated; that the member nominating the committee must be\r\n    supposed to feel as strong an interest in the proper consideration\r\n    of the subject as any one, and also to possess or to be willing to\r\n    obtain the knowledge necessary to enable him to decide upon the\r\n    qualifications of the members he selects.”[38]\r\n\r\nIn this vindication the careful and elaborate author shows how\r\ncompletely the early rule is recognized. The same learned authority,\r\nwhile stating the English and American Parliamentary Law, shows how\r\nthe examination is conducted:--\r\n\r\n    “When an inquiry is instituted and an examination of witnesses\r\n    undertaken by the House in its inquisitorial capacity, it is\r\n    customary for the member on whose motion or suggestion the inquiry\r\n    has been engaged in, or for some of the members voting with him for\r\n    the inquiry, to take the lead in the examination of the witnesses,\r\n    … or, in other words, to examine the witnesses in chief.”[39]\r\n\r\nPlainly, according to this usage, Mr. Schurz, and not Mr. Hamlin,\r\nshould take the lead and examine the witnesses in chief.\r\n\r\nThe other parliamentary authority to which I refer is Hon. R. M.\r\nT. Hunter, former Speaker of the House of Representatives. In his\r\nvaledictory speech, March 3, 1841, this gentleman, who brought thought\r\nand study to the discharge of his public duties, took occasion to\r\nexplain the principles governing the formation of committees, and\r\nall must admit that he did it with a clearness and philosophy not\r\nsurpassed in parliamentary history. According to him, those having\r\nthe affirmative of a proposition should have the direction of the\r\ncommittee. Speaking generally, he says:--\r\n\r\n    “The party upon which it naturally devolves to propose a question\r\n    ought to have the power, it would seem, to present its proposition\r\n    in the shape for which it is willing to be responsible; and as the\r\n    different parties hold the affirmative according to the nature of\r\n    the question, so ought the constitution of the committees to be\r\n    varied.”\r\n\r\nThen, in language precisely applicable to the present case, the Speaker\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n    “In committees of investigation it is equally clear that the\r\n    opposition, _who hold the affirmative_, should have the majority\r\n    and the power.”[40]\r\n\r\nThis instructive statement is in admirable harmony with the rule, as\r\ndeclared in early times, that those “against the thing” cannot go on\r\nthe committee,--and that a measure, like a child, is not put to a nurse\r\nthat cares not for it. The old Parliamentarians were less philosophical\r\nthan the American Speaker, but each meant the same thing. The prime\r\nobject is opportunity and fair play for those bringing forward a\r\nproposition, or holding the affirmative. A committee _organized to\r\nsustain the negative_ is the very committee described as a nurse that\r\ncares not for the child, and therefore is a committee not tolerated by\r\nParliamentary Law.\r\n\r\nThus from all quarters--beginning with the distant in time, embracing\r\nJefferson, the father of American Parliamentary Law, Cushing, its\r\nmost authoritative American expounder, and not forgetting an American\r\nSpeaker--proceeds concurring testimony to the parliamentary rule\r\nrequiring an inquiry to be placed in the hands of its friends;\r\nespecially is it necessary that the chairman, who directs the inquiry\r\nand examines the witnesses, should be known as one of its friends.\r\n\r\nTherefore I must be pardoned, if I renew my Protest against the\r\ncompetency of the present Committee. I protest against it as\r\nconstituted in flagrant violation of Parliamentary Law; and I protest\r\nespecially against the acting Chairman, who undertakes to direct this\r\ninquiry and to examine witnesses, as not coming within the conditions\r\nestablished by rule, by usage, and by reason. The record shows that\r\nhe did not move the inquiry, nor did he coöperate with the mover, or\r\ntake any part in sustaining him, while in open speech he showed himself\r\n“against the thing.” I object to the acting Chairman as to a judge or\r\njuror disqualified to sit in a court.\r\n\r\nI make this second Protest with infinite reluctance. But the Committee\r\nleave me no alternative. In their invitation, in the nature of a\r\nsummons, and now in their subpœna, they compel me to declare my\r\nobjection to their competency. Seeing it as clearly as I do, and\r\nfeeling it as strongly as I do, I cannot avoid expressing it. If I do\r\nso twice, it is because the Committee have laid me twice under this\r\nobligation. Beyond that sentiment of duty which is with me a rule of\r\nlife, I am encouraged to this effort by the hope that, even if the\r\npresent Committee cannot be corrected in conformity with Parliamentary\r\nLaw, its incompetency is so clearly exposed that it will be powerless\r\nhereafter as a precedent. If obliged to witness the present dishonor\r\nof a time-honored rule, I would at least save this safeguard for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nIn thus declaring my profound sense of the wrong that has been\r\nattempted, I do all in my power to maintain Parliamentary Law\r\ninviolate. I regret that I cannot do more.\r\n\r\nWith this explanation, and yielding to the command of the Committee, I\r\noffer myself for examination on matters proper for inquiry; but I do it\r\nunder protest.\r\n\r\nCHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\nSENATE CHAMBER, 27th March, 1872.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Carpenter moved that the two Protests be returned to Mr.\r\n    Sumner, as disrespectful to the Committee. On a subsequent day the\r\n    motion was withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS ON THE FREE LIST.\r\n\r\nREMARKS IN THE SENATE ON MOVING AN AMENDMENT TO A TARIFF BILL, MARCH\r\n27, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n    On the question of concurrence in an amendment made in Committee of\r\n    the Whole relative to the free list, Mr. Sumner said:--\r\n\r\nI move to amend that amendment by adding after the provision as to\r\nbooks, as arranged alphabetically in the free list,--\r\n\r\n    Books in the ancient and foreign languages.\r\n\r\nI have letters very often from learned professors in different parts of\r\nthe country, complaining of the cost of books that they are constrained\r\nto purchase in order to carry on their studies and to enable them to\r\nteach. This is the case with Greek professors, professors in all the\r\nlanguages, ancient and modern. It is also the case with men of science,\r\nwho desire works in the Continental languages; they complain bitterly\r\nof the expense to which they are put.\r\n\r\nNow, if I can have the attention of the Senate one moment, I will\r\nendeavor to show that these works cannot come in competition with\r\nany books here at home. Certainly they cannot with regard to any\r\nconsiderable interest. I think, if these could be put on the free\r\nlist, an essential service would be done; the revenue would lose very\r\nlittle, and no considerable interest in our country would suffer. I\r\nhope, therefore, there can be no question but that the Senate will\r\nallow this to be adopted.\r\n\r\n        MR. MORRILL [of Vermont]. I trust this amendment will not be\r\n        adopted. It is evidently an old acquaintance of the Senate.\r\n        I think the Senator from Massachusetts has always moved it\r\n        whenever he has had an opportunity.\r\n\r\n    To the argument advanced by Mr. Morrill in support of this\r\n    objection,--namely, “that the school-books of America should be\r\n    American in character, and printed and published by American\r\n    publishers,”--Mr. Sumner replied:--\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT,--The argument of my friend is against English books,\r\nand not books in ancient or foreign languages. At any rate, the chief\r\npoint of his argument was addressed to works in the English language.\r\nHe called our attention, for instance, to Smith’s “Dictionary of the\r\nBible,” an English work; and he knows well, that, as it is a recent\r\nwork, it is not on our free list, and the amendment which I move does\r\nnot touch it. My amendment concerns books in the ancient languages, and\r\nin foreign languages, that is, in the languages of modern Europe; and\r\nthe single point of the Senator is school-books. Now I ask whether we\r\nshould not do all we can to make the school-books as cheap as possible?\r\nWill the Senator put a protective duty on school-books?--make the child\r\nwith “shining morning face” as he goes to school pay a duty? I would\r\nhave the school-books as cheap as possible. But then how few are the\r\nschool-books that would come in under this provision?\r\n\r\nMy amendment reaches the large amount of works concerning science and\r\nliterature and jurisprudence in ancient and in foreign languages; and\r\nwhy should these be subjected to a duty? Why should those scholars,\r\nthose enlightened professional men who import these books, be\r\nsubjected to this additional expense? Sir, I honor the man, whether of\r\nscholarship, of science, or of a profession, who imports these works of\r\nlearning. He is a benefactor to his country. Every such work becomes\r\na fountain in the neighborhood: but I would not put a duty on that\r\nfountain; I would unseal it; I would open it, and let it flow as amply\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\n    MR. MORRILL [of Maine]. I should like to ask the Senator from\r\n    Massachusetts whether there are any books in foreign languages that\r\n    are not published in this country. Are not all the books in the\r\n    ancient languages published in this country?\r\n\r\nMR. SUMNER. I beg to call the Senator’s attention to the boundless\r\nannual literature of Germany, where the volumes are counted by the\r\nthousand,--to the extensive literature of France, where the volumes are\r\ncounted by the thousand,--to the less ample literature of Spain and\r\nItaly, with numerous publications, all of which, if imported, pay a\r\nduty. Now I wish to encourage that importation.\r\n\r\n    MR. MORRILL. I understood the Senator’s argument to be in favor of\r\n    ancient books.\r\n\r\nMR. SUMNER. It is also, certainly.\r\n\r\n    MR. MORRILL. My inquiry is, whether those books are not all\r\n    republished in this country.\r\n\r\nMR. SUMNER. Not at all. For instance, take most of the considerable\r\nworks of scholarship in German, annually produced, bearing on the\r\nclassics; they are not republished in our country, but our professors\r\nimport them at cost. Then take another class of works, on science, in\r\nthe German language, in the French language,--I would say also in the\r\nItalian language, for there are some excellent contributions to science\r\nas well as to literature in the Italian language,--those, if imported,\r\npay a duty; but they do not come into competition with anything printed\r\nhere. Why, then, should they pay a duty? Why not encourage their\r\nimportation? Why not help the man of science, or the learned professor,\r\nwho aspires to enlarge his library in this way? I have said that I\r\nregard such a person as a benefactor. I wish to give him my thanks, and\r\nmy help, if I can. The best help I can give him is to try to save him\r\nfrom this additional tax.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Sumner’s Amendment was rejected,--Yeas 12, Nays not counted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NASBY LETTERS.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION TO THE COLLECTION,[41] APRIL 1, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond the interest in these letters as another instance of a peculiar\r\nliterature,--illustrated by Major Jack Downing, Sam Slick, and\r\nthe genius of Hosea Biglow,--they have an historic character from\r\nthe part they performed in the war with Slavery, and in advancing\r\nReconstruction. Appearing with a certain regularity and enjoying\r\nan extensive circulation, they became a constant and welcome ally.\r\nUnquestionably they were among the influences and agencies by which\r\ndisloyalty in all its forms was exposed, and public opinion assured on\r\nthe right side. It is impossible to measure their value. Against the\r\ndevices of Slavery and its supporters, each letter was like a speech,\r\nor one of those songs which stir the people. Therefore they belong to\r\nthe political history of this critical period.\r\n\r\nOf publications during the war, none had such charm for Abraham\r\nLincoln. He read every letter as it appeared, and kept them all within\r\nreach for refreshment. This strong liking illustrates his character,\r\nand will always awaken an interest in the letters. An incident in my\r\nown relations with him shows how easily he turned from care to humor.\r\n\r\nI had occasion to see President Lincoln very late in the evening of\r\nMarch 17th, 1865. The interview was in the familiar room known as\r\nhis office, and also used for cabinet meetings. I did not take leave\r\nof him until some time after midnight, and then the business was not\r\nentirely finished. As I rose, he said, “Come to me when I open shop\r\nin the morning; I will have the order written, and you shall see it.”\r\n“When do you open shop?” said I. “At nine o’clock,” he replied. At\r\nthe hour named I was in the same room that I had so recently left.\r\nVery soon the President entered, stepping quickly with the promised\r\norder in his hands, which he at once read to me. It was to disapprove\r\nand annul the judgment and sentence of a court-martial in a case that\r\nhad excited much feeling. While I was making an abstract of the order\r\nfor communication by telegraph to the anxious parties, he broke into\r\nquotation from Nasby. Finding me less at home than himself with his\r\nfavorite humorist, he said pleasantly, “I must initiate you,” and then\r\nrepeated with enthusiasm the message he had sent to the author: “For\r\nthe genius to write these things I would gladly give up my office.”\r\n\r\nRising from his seat, he opened a desk behind, and, taking from it a\r\npamphlet collection of the letters already published, proceeded to read\r\nfrom it with infinite zest, while his melancholy features grew bright.\r\nIt was a delight to see him surrender so completely to the fascination.\r\nFinding that I listened, he read for more than twenty minutes, and was\r\nstill proceeding, when it occurred to me that there must be many at\r\nthe door waiting to see him on graver matters. Taking advantage of a\r\npause, I rose, and, thanking him for the lesson of the morning, went\r\naway. Some thirty persons, including Senators and Representatives, were\r\nin the antechamber as I passed out.\r\n\r\nThough with the President much during the intervening time before his\r\ndeath, this was the last business I transacted with him. A few days\r\nlater he left Washington for City Point, on the James River, where he\r\nwas at the surrender of Richmond. April 6th I joined him there. April\r\n9th the party returned to Washington. On the evening of April 14th the\r\nbullet of an assassin took his life.\r\n\r\nIn this simple story Abraham Lincoln introduces Nasby.\r\n\r\nCHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, April 1st, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVICE TO THE COLORED PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO THE NATIONAL CONVENTION OF COLORED PEOPLE AT NEW ORLEANS,\r\nAPRIL 7, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, April 7, 1872.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR,--In reply to your inquiry, I make haste to say, that, in\r\n  my judgment, the Colored Convention should think more of principles\r\n  than of men,--except so far as men stand for principles. Above all,\r\n  let them insist on the rights of their own much-abused and insulted\r\n  people.\r\n\r\n  It is absurd for anybody to say that he “accepts the situation,” and\r\n  then deny the equal rights of the colored man. If the “situation” is\r\n  accepted in good faith, it must be entirely,--including not merely\r\n  the abolition of Slavery and the establishment of equal suffrage,\r\n  but also all those other rights which are still denied or abridged.\r\n  There must be complete equality before the law, so that in all\r\n  institutions, agencies, or conveniences, created or regulated by law,\r\n  there can be no discrimination on account of color, but a black man\r\n  shall be treated as a white man.\r\n\r\n  In maintaining their rights, it will be proper for the Convention to\r\n  invoke the Declaration of Independence, so that its principles and\r\n  promises shall become a living reality, never to be questioned in\r\n  any way, but recognized always as a guide of conduct and a governing\r\n  rule in the interpretation of the National Constitution, being in the\r\n  nature of a Bill of Rights preceding the Constitution.\r\n\r\n  It is not enough to “proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto\r\n  all the inhabitants thereof.” Equality must be proclaimed also; and\r\n  since both are promised by the great Declaration, which is a national\r\n  act, and as from their nature they should be uniform throughout the\r\n  country, both must be placed under the safeguard of national law.\r\n  There can be but one liberty and one equality, the same in Boston and\r\n  New Orleans, the same everywhere throughout the country.\r\n\r\n  The colored people are not ungenerous, and therefore will incline to\r\n  any measures of good-will and reconciliation; but I trust no excess\r\n  of benevolence will make them consent to any postponement of those\r\n  equal rights which are still refused. The disabilities of colored\r\n  people, loyal and long-suffering, should be removed before the\r\n  disabilities of former Rebels; or at least the two removals should go\r\n  hand in hand.\r\n\r\n  It only remains that I should say, “Stand firm!” The politicians will\r\n  then know that you are in earnest, and will no longer be trifled\r\n  with. Victory will follow soon, and the good cause be secure forever.\r\n\r\n  Meanwhile accept my best wishes for the Convention, and believe me,\r\n  dear Professor,\r\n\r\n       Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  TO PROFESSOR JOHN M. LANGSTON, WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIPLOMATIC AGENTS OF THE UNITED STATES NOT TO ACCEPT GIFTS FROM FOREIGN\r\nPOWERS.\r\n\r\nREMARKS IN THE SENATE, MAY 2, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Cameron, having moved to take up a joint resolution reported by\r\n    him from the Committee on Foreign Relations, “permitting certain\r\n    diplomatic and consular officers of the United States in France to\r\n    accept testimonials from the Emperor of Germany for their friendly\r\n    services toward the subjects of the Emperor during the war between\r\n    France and Germany,”--Mr. Sumner promptly protested:--\r\n\r\nI must object to it with my whole soul. I consider it a most vicious\r\nproposition, utterly untenable. The Constitution of the United States\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n    “No person holding any office of profit or trust under them [the\r\n    United States] shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept\r\n    of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever,\r\n    from any king, prince, or foreign State.”\r\n\r\nNot even from the German Empire. Congress has followed one rule from\r\nthe beginning, I believe,--never to allow its diplomatic agents to\r\nreceive anything from a foreign power. It has allowed its naval\r\nofficers, who have rendered some humane service at sea to the subjects\r\nof a foreign power, to receive some reward or recognition, some\r\nhonor, some compliment; but it has never allowed any person in its\r\ndiplomatic service to receive any such reward, honor, or compliment.\r\nI think the Senate will see that this rule proceeds on a ground from\r\nwhich we cannot depart. It is, that our representatives abroad must be\r\nkept always above all suspicion of acting under foreign influence, or\r\nthe temptation of foreign reward. Nor should we, Sir, be gratified,\r\nI think, to see these representatives abroad wearing at their\r\nbutton-holes the insignia of any foreign power.\r\n\r\nI hope, Sir, the Senate will not take up this matter again. It ought to\r\nbe allowed to drop out of sight.\r\n\r\n    The matter was dropped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF THE PARK AT WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nREMARKS IN THE SENATE, MAY 15, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Senate having under consideration a bill from the House\r\n    confirming a grant by the City Council of Washington of a site for\r\n    a railway dépôt in the public park, Mr. Sumner said:--\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT,--To my mind this bill is injudicious; and in saying this\r\nI give an opinion reached after the most careful consideration of it in\r\nthe Committee. I think it ought not to be adopted by the Senate. I say\r\nthis with reluctance, for I sympathize keenly with every improvement\r\nand with every facility afforded to this growing and beautiful\r\nmetropolis; and may I say, also, I feel a personal sympathy with the\r\ndistinguished citizen of Pennsylvania particularly interested in this\r\nmeasure? And yet, approaching its consideration with those biases in\r\nits favor, I am bound to conclude against it.\r\n\r\nSir, I do not think that this privilege ought to be granted, and my\r\nreason is precise and specific. It proposes to take a considerable\r\nsection of land, which, if you look on the map, you will see properly\r\nbelongs to the Park of Washington. I am unwilling, at this early period\r\nin the history of this metropolis, to begin by cutting out a slice\r\nfrom this inclosure set apart for the future. If you do it now, where\r\nare you to stop? Will you not be called to cut out another slice next\r\nyear, or in five years,--and may not the Park be reduced from that form\r\nand those proportions it promises to enjoy? This metropolis is now at\r\nits beginning, and yet doubling in a decade. During the last ten years\r\nits population has multiplied twofold; and in the coming ten years\r\nthere is every reason to believe that the development will be as large,\r\nif not larger. Of course with the increase of population is the demand\r\nfor a park, especially in the central situation which that enjoys. I\r\nuse the language of another, when I say that parks are the lungs of\r\na great city; but where will be the lungs of this metropolis, if you\r\nbegin now to reduce the Park? Rather should we sacredly keep it all\r\nintact, so that hereafter, when you and I, Sir, have passed away, and\r\nthis metropolis has grown to a grandeur and beauty which imagination\r\ncannot now conceive, that Park may remain in its entirety, a blessing\r\nto the people, for which they themselves in turn will bless us.\r\n\r\nSir, I was born in a city which has the enjoyment of such a blessing.\r\nThere is in Boston what is known as The Common, set apart in the very\r\nearliest days of the old town, when it was in fact what the name\r\nimplies,--a common for the pasturage of cattle; but, though often\r\nassailed, it has been preserved untouched. Railroad corporations and\r\nother companies have tried in vain to obtain a corner from it. The\r\njealous city fathers have saved that beautiful piece of earth, till\r\nnow it is the first treasure of Boston,--unless we except her common\r\nschools, where all are equal before the law. I have often thought\r\nwhat would have ensued if some time ago, yielding to corporation\r\npressure in its various forms, the city had consented to sacrifice that\r\nbeautiful inclosure. There it is, the very apple of the eye to Boston;\r\nand nobody now fears that it will be diminished by a foot.\r\n\r\nAnd should not Washington have a similar possession? Are you\r\nwilling, Sir, now at this early moment of her history, when she is\r\njust beginning to grow, or rather when her growth is just beginning\r\nto be apparent, to despoil her of this unquestionable attraction,\r\nwhere the useful and the beautiful commingle? I think, Sir, you will\r\nact improvidently, if you do so. I think you will act against the\r\nbest interests of the city, whether you look at health, beauty, or\r\nenjoyment; for a park ministers to all these.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Sir, would I keep it intact. By no consent of Congress\r\nwould I allow any business interest or disturbing railroad company\r\nto fasten itself upon this inclosure. They should be excluded; and\r\nwhen I say this, I would not carry them off far. Let them plant their\r\nstations just the other side. They will then be perhaps a third of a\r\nmile from Pennsylvania Avenue, traversing the centre of population\r\nwith conveniences such as railroads in no other city enjoy. With those\r\nopen to them, why should we allow them to enter our pleasure-grounds?\r\nIf there were no proper place without going a long distance, a mile or\r\ntwo miles, there would be some reason, perhaps, for entertaining this\r\nquestion; but when I consider the facilities which they may enjoy only\r\nthe other side of the Park line, with land there cheap and easy to be\r\nhad, I am astonished that any one can be willing to sacrifice the Park\r\nsimply to bring them a few rods nearer Pennsylvania Avenue.\r\n\r\nAnd this brings me to the question of travel on the Avenue. If you put\r\na railway station as is proposed, you will bring on the Avenue all that\r\nglut and accumulation of carriages and wagons always concentrated about\r\nthe terminus of a great line of travel. I think it will be injurious to\r\nthe Avenue. That alone would be a reason with me against the bill.\r\n\r\nBut as often as I think of the question, I come back to the Park,\r\nwhich, say what you will, is destined to be one of the most important\r\npossessions of this metropolis, and for the special enjoyment of\r\nthe people. They will enjoy this Capitol, for it is beautiful to\r\nbehold,--also the other public edifices, some of them excellent in\r\nstyle and grateful to the eye; but nothing of all these will be what\r\nwe may expect that Park to be,--a place where the young and old will\r\nresort of an evening to enjoy innocent recreation and congenial\r\nsociety, while the open air or the opportunities of exercise impart\r\nto them that best blessing, health. Sir, that Park should not be\r\nsacrificed; and if you have any doubt, let me lay before you the\r\ntestimony of another place. I have already cited Boston; I now call\r\nyour attention to Philadelphia. You know the remarkable park which\r\nhas been opened there. I stopped a day in Philadelphia last summer,\r\non my way home, especially to see and enjoy this magnificent resort;\r\nand I was well rewarded. I beheld the most beautiful park, certainly\r\nin its promise, on this continent; and I doubt if there is one even in\r\nthe European world of equal promise. But no one can enter its grounds\r\nwithout annoyance and trouble from the railroad-crossings, and the\r\nperpetual sound of the steam-engine with its shrill whistle, so little\r\nin harmony with pleasure-grounds.\r\n\r\nIt requires no scientific knowledge, no practical acquaintance with\r\nrailroads, to see that those crossings are a positive nuisance, and\r\nthat the hospitable park set apart for the population of a mighty city,\r\nand destined to be one of the most beautiful objects of the civilized\r\nworld, actually suffers from the nuisance. I appeal to Senators who\r\nhave visited it; I know that there is not one who will say that I am\r\nnot right. There is not one who has ever entered those grounds, not\r\neven the Senator from Pennsylvania who pioneers this bill, that will\r\nnot say he regrets those railroad-crossings and wishes them out of\r\nthe way. But I shall not rely upon the authority of the Senator or\r\nmy own testimony. I have in my hand the last annual report of the\r\nCommissioners, and I wish the Senate to hear what they say:--\r\n\r\n    “At an early period of their organization the Commissioners\r\n    addressed themselves to the solution of the very difficult problem\r\n    of how to attain the best approaches to the Park, and they have not\r\n    at any time ceased to give that matter their earnest attention. If\r\n    a former generation could have foreseen”--\r\n\r\nNow see, Senators, how this applies to the present case,--\r\n\r\n     “If a former generation could have foreseen that the liberal\r\n    views which far-sighted men among them held on the subject of\r\n    a park which should embrace both banks of the Schuylkill would\r\n    finally ripen into a fruition beyond what the most sanguine could\r\n    then have dreamed, the great railways which now run in close\r\n    proximity to that stream would have reached the city by other\r\n    routes, or at least would have been carried on tracks more remote\r\n    from the river. At that day this could readily have been done\r\n    without conflicting with any interest; but now that the conditions\r\n    have been long established, and trade and travel settled in\r\n    conformity to them, any violent change must be regarded as out of\r\n    the question.”[42]\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners then make certain recommendations, which I will not\r\ntake up time to read. But I come to a brief passage:--\r\n\r\n    “The Commissioners, therefore, respectfully but strenuously\r\n    urge that steps shall be immediately taken to promote this most\r\n    desirable end. And they do this not alone in the interest of the\r\n    thousands whose vehicles are entangled at the railroad-crossing,\r\n    but much more in the interest of the hundreds of thousands\r\n    whose principal enjoyment of the Park has been and will be in\r\n    that portion of it which is most exposed to these dangerous\r\n    annoyances.”[43]\r\n\r\nThat is testimony. If this were a court of justice instead of\r\nthe Senate, and if you, Sir, were a court and the Senators now\r\nbefore me were a jury, that would be a testimony conclusive in the\r\ncase,--testimony of experts, who know by experience what they testify,\r\nwho have seen with their own eyes and felt in their own consciousness,\r\nwhenever they entered that park, the nuisance against which I now\r\nprotest. Sir, they testify against the present bill. Can you answer the\r\ntestimony? Is it not clear? Is it not complete?\r\n\r\nSir, I need no testimony. I only ask Senators to look at the Park. Let\r\nthem pass through our Library and take their stand on that unequalled\r\nportico from which they may look down upon an amphitheatre more like\r\nthat of ancient Rome than that of any other capital, with a river\r\nbeneath and hills in the distance,--a river much larger than the\r\nancient Tiber, and hills much more beautiful than those that stand\r\nabout Rome,--and a Capitol, too, but how much more beautiful than that\r\nwhich once gave the law to mankind! Stand on that portico, Sir, and\r\nsurvey the amphitheatre; your eye will then rest with satisfaction on\r\nthe outline of this very Park, stretching from the Capitol beyond the\r\nExecutive Mansion, and destined to be a breathing-place for the immense\r\npopulation of future generations. Stand on that portico and try to\r\nimagine what this Park may be.\r\n\r\nAnd now it is proposed not only to diminish that breathing-place, but\r\nto disturb it by the smoke of steam-engines, and to confuse it by\r\nthe perpetual din of locomotives. I hope no such thing will be done.\r\nThere is a place for all things; and this I know, the place for a\r\nrailway-station is not a public park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOURS OF LABOR.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO THE CONVENTION OF THE MASSACHUSETTS LABOR UNION IN BOSTON,\r\nMAY 25, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          SENATE CHAMBER, May 25, 1872.\r\n\r\n  GENTLEMEN,--I cannot take part in your public meeting, but I declare\r\n  my sympathy with the working-men in their aspirations for greater\r\n  equality of condition and increased opportunities. I therefore insist\r\n  that the experiment of an eight-hour law in the national workshops\r\n  shall be fairly tried, so that, if successful, it may be extended.\r\n\r\n  Here let me confess that I find this law especially valuable, because\r\n  it promises more time for education and general improvement. If the\r\n  experiment is successful in this respect, I shall be less curious\r\n  on the question of pecuniary profit and loss; for to my mind the\r\n  education of the human family is above dollars and dividends.\r\n\r\n  Meanwhile accept my best wishes, and believe me\r\n\r\n      Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  TO THE COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARBITRATION AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR WAR.\r\n\r\nRESOLUTIONS IN THE SENATE, MAY 31, 1872, CONCERNING ARBITRATION AS A\r\nSUBSTITUTE FOR WAR IN DETERMINING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas by International Law and existing custom War is recognized as a\r\nform of Trial for the determination of differences between nations; and\r\n\r\nWhereas for generations good men have protested against the irrational\r\ncharacter of this arbitrament, where force instead of justice prevails,\r\nand have anxiously sought for a substitute in the nature of a judicial\r\ntribunal, all of which was expressed by Franklin in his exclamation,\r\n“When will mankind be convinced that all wars are follies, very\r\nexpensive and very mischievous, and agree to settle their differences\r\nby Arbitration?”[44] and\r\n\r\nWhereas war once prevailed in the determination of differences between\r\nindividuals, between cities, between counties, and between provinces,\r\nbeing recognized in all these cases as the arbiter of justice, but\r\nat last yielded to a judicial tribunal, and now, in the progress of\r\ncivilization, the time has come for the extension of this humane\r\nprinciple to nations, so that their differences may be taken from the\r\narbitrament of war, and, in conformity with these examples, submitted\r\nto a judicial tribunal; and\r\n\r\nWhereas Arbitration has been formally recognized as a substitute\r\nfor war in the determination of differences between nations, being\r\nespecially recommended by the Congress of Paris, where were assembled\r\nthe representatives of England, France, Russia, Prussia, Austria,\r\nSardinia, and Turkey, and afterward adopted by the United States in\r\nformal treaty with Great Britain for the determination of differences\r\narising from depredations of British cruisers, and also from opposing\r\nclaims with regard to the San Juan boundary; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it becomes important to consider and settle the true character\r\nof this beneficent tribunal, thus commended and adopted, so that its\r\nauthority and completeness as a substitute for war may not be impaired,\r\nbut strengthened and upheld, to the end that civilization may be\r\nadvanced and war be limited in its sphere: Therefore,\r\n\r\n1. _Resolved_, That in the determination of international differences\r\nArbitration should become a substitute for war in reality as in\r\nname, and therefore coëxtensive with war in jurisdiction, so that\r\nany question or grievance which might be the occasion of war or of\r\nmisunderstanding between nations should be considered by this tribunal.\r\n\r\n2. _Resolved_, That any withdrawal from a treaty recognizing\r\nArbitration, or any refusal to abide the judgment of the accepted\r\ntribunal, or any interposition of technicalities to limit the\r\nproceedings, is to this extent a disparagement of the tribunal as a\r\nsubstitute for war, and therefore hostile to civilization.\r\n\r\n3. _Resolved_, That the United States, having at heart the cause\r\nof peace everywhere, and hoping to help its permanent establishment\r\nbetween nations, hereby recommend the adoption of Arbitration as a\r\njust and practical method for the determination of international\r\ndifferences, to be maintained sincerely and in good faith, so that war\r\nmay cease to be regarded as a proper form of trial between nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPUBLICANISM VS.

PRESIDENT,--I have no hesitation in declaring myself a member of\r\nthe Republican Party, and one of the straitest of the sect. I doubt\r\nif any Senator can point to earlier or more constant service in its\r\nbehalf. I began at the beginning, and from that early day have never\r\nfailed to sustain its candidates and to advance its principles. For\r\nthese I have labored always by speech and vote, in the Senate and\r\nelsewhere,--at first with few only, but at last, as success began to\r\ndawn, then with multitudes flocking forward. In this cause I never\r\nasked who were my associates or how many they would number. In the\r\nconsciousness of right I was willing to be alone. To such a party, with\r\nwhich so much of my life is intertwined, I have no common attachment.\r\nNot without regret can I see it suffer; not without a pang can I see\r\nit changed from its original character, for such a change is death.\r\nTherefore do I ask, with no common feeling, that the peril which\r\nmenaces it may pass away. I stood by its cradle; let me not follow its\r\nhearse.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN AND OBJECT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\r\n\r\nTurning back to its birth, I recall a speech of my own at a State\r\nConvention in Massachusetts, as early as September 7, 1854, where\r\nI vindicated its principles and announced its name in these words:\r\n“As _Republicans_ we go forth to encounter the _Oligarchs_ of\r\nSlavery.”[45] The report records the applause with which this name was\r\nreceived by the excited multitude. Years of conflict ensued, in which\r\nthe good cause constantly gained. At last, in the spring of 1860,\r\nAbraham Lincoln was nominated by this party as its candidate for the\r\nPresidency; and here pardon me, if I refer again to myself. On my way\r\nhome from the Senate I was detained in New York by the invitation of\r\nparty friends to speak at the Cooper Institute on the issues of the\r\npending election. The speech was made July 11, and, I believe, was the\r\nearliest of the campaign. As published at the time, it was entitled\r\n“Origin, Necessity, and Permanence of the Republican Party,” and to\r\nexhibit these was its precise object. Both the necessity and permanence\r\nof the party were asserted. A brief passage, which I take from the\r\nreport in the “New York Herald,” will show the duty and destiny I\r\nventured then to hold up. After dwelling on the evils of Slavery and\r\nthe corruptions it had engendered, including the purchase of votes at\r\nthe polls, I proceeded as follows:--\r\n\r\n     “Therefore, just so long as the present false theories of\r\n    Slavery prevail, whether concerning its character morally,\r\n    economically, and socially, or concerning its prerogatives under\r\n    the Constitution, just so long as the Slave Oligarchy, which is the\r\n    sleepless and unhesitating agent of Slavery in all its pretensions,\r\n    continues to exist as a political power, the Republican Party\r\n    must endure. [_Applause._] If bad men conspire for Slavery, good\r\n    men must combine for Freedom. [‘_Good! good!_’] Nor can the Holy\r\n    War be ended until the barbarism now dominant in the Republic is\r\n    overthrown, and the Pagan power is driven from our Jerusalem.\r\n    [_Applause._] And when this triumph is won, securing the immediate\r\n    object of our organization, the Republican Party will not die,\r\n    but, purified by its long contest with Slavery and filled with\r\n    higher life, it will be lifted to yet other efforts and with\r\n    nobler aims for the good of man. [_Applause, with three cheers for\r\n    Lincoln._]”[46]\r\n\r\nSuch, on the eve of the Presidential election, was my description of\r\nthe Republican Party and my aspiration for its future. It was not to\r\ndie, but, “purified by its long contest with Slavery and filled with\r\nhigher life,” we were to behold it “lifted to yet other efforts and\r\nwith nobler aims for the good of man.” Here was nothing personal,\r\nnothing mean or petty. The Republican Party was necessary and\r\npermanent, and always on an ascending plane. For such a party there\r\nwas no death, but higher life and nobler aims; and this was the party\r\nto which I gave my vows. But, alas, how changed! Once country was the\r\nobject, and not a man; once principle was inscribed on the victorious\r\nbanners, and not a name only.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REPUBLICAN PARTY SEIZED BY THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to indicate when this disastrous change, exalting\r\nthe will of one man above all else, became not merely manifest, but\r\npainfully conspicuous. Already it had begun to show itself in personal\r\npretensions, to which I shall refer soon, when, suddenly and without\r\nany warning through the public press or any expression from public\r\nopinion, the President elected by the Republican Party precipitated\r\nupon the country an ill-considered and ill-omened scheme for the\r\nannexion of a portion of the island of San Domingo, in pursuance\r\nof a treaty negotiated by a person of his own household styling\r\nhimself “Aide-de-Camp to the President of the United States.” Had\r\nthis effort, however injudicious in object, been confined to ordinary\r\nand constitutional proceedings, with proper regard for a coördinate\r\nbranch of the Government, it would have soon dropped out of sight\r\nand been remembered only as a blunder. But it was not so. Strangely\r\nand unaccountably, it was pressed for months by every means and\r\nappliance of power, whether at home or abroad, now reaching into the\r\nSenate Chamber, and now into the waters about the island. Reluctant\r\nSenators were subdued to its support, while, treading under foot the\r\nConstitution in one of its most distinctive republican principles,\r\nthe President seized the war powers of the nation, instituted foreign\r\nintervention, and capped the climax of usurpation by menace of violence\r\nto the Black Republic of Hayti, where the colored race have begun\r\nthe experiment of self-government,--thus adding manifest outrage of\r\nInternational Law to manifest outrage of the Constitution, while the\r\nlong-suffering African was condemned to new indignity. All these\r\nthings, so utterly indefensible and aggravating, and therefore to be\r\npromptly disowned, found defenders on this floor. The President who\r\nwas the original author of the wrongs continued to maintain them,\r\nand appealed to Republican Senators for help,--thus fulfilling the\r\neccentric stipulation with the Government of Baez executed by his\r\nAide-de-Camp.\r\n\r\nAt last a Republican Senator, who felt it his duty to exhibit these\r\nplain violations of the Constitution and of International Law, and\r\nthen in obedience to the irresistible promptings of his nature and in\r\nharmony with his whole life pleaded for the equal rights of the Black\r\nRepublic, who declared that he did this as a Republican and to save the\r\nparty from this wretched complicity,--this Republican Senator, engaged\r\nin a patriotic service, and anxious to save the colored people from\r\noutrage, was denounced on this floor as a traitor to the party; and\r\nthis was done by a Senator speaking for the party, and known to be in\r\nintimate relations with the President guilty of these wrongs. Evidently\r\nthe party was in process of change from that generous association\r\ndedicated to Human Rights and to the guardianship of the African race.\r\nToo plainly it was becoming the instrument of _one man and his personal\r\nwill_,--no matter how much he set at defiance the Constitution and\r\nInternational Law, or how much he insulted the colored people. The\r\nPresident was to be maintained at all hazards, notwithstanding his\r\naberrations, and all who called them in question were to be struck down.\r\n\r\nIn exhibiting this autocratic pretension, so revolutionary and\r\nunrepublican in character, I mean to be moderate in language and\r\nto keep within the strictest bounds. The facts are indisputable,\r\nand nobody can deny the gross violation of the Constitution and of\r\nInternational Law with insult to the Black Republic,--the whole case\r\nbeing more reprehensible, as also plainly more unconstitutional and\r\nmore illegal, than anything alleged against Andrew Johnson on his\r\nimpeachment. Believe me, Sir, I should gladly leave this matter to the\r\njudgment already recorded, if it were not put in issue again by the\r\nextraordinary efforts, radiating on every line of office, to press its\r\nauthor for a second term as President; and since silence gives consent,\r\nall these efforts are his efforts. They become more noteworthy when it\r\nis considered that the name of the candidate thus pressed has become\r\na sign of discord and not of concord, dividing instead of uniting the\r\nRepublican Party, so that these extraordinary efforts tend directly\r\nto the disruption of the party,--all of which he witnesses, and again\r\nby his silence ratifies. “Let the party split,” says the President,\r\n“I will not renounce my chance of a second term.” The extent of this\r\npersonal pressure and the subordination of the party to the will of an\r\nindividual compel us to consider his pretensions. These, too, are in\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL PRETENSIONS.\r\n\r\n“Upon what meat doth this our Cæsar feed,” that he should assume so\r\nmuch? No honor for victory in war can justify disobedience to the\r\nConstitution and to Law; nor can it afford the least apology for any\r\npersonal immunity, privilege, or license in the Presidential office. A\r\nPresident must turn into a King before it can be said of him that he\r\ncan do no wrong. He is responsible always. As President he is foremost\r\nservant of the Law, bound to obey its slightest mandate. As the elect\r\nof the people he owes not only the example of willing obedience, but\r\nalso of fidelity and industry in the discharge of his exalted office,\r\nwith an absolute abnegation of all self-seeking. Nothing for self, but\r\nall for country. And now, as we regard the career of this candidate,\r\nwe find to our amazement how little it accords with this simple\r\nrequirement. Bring it to the touchstone and it fails.\r\n\r\nNot only are Constitution and Law disregarded, but the Presidential\r\noffice itself is treated as little more than a plaything and a\r\nperquisite,--when not the former, then the latter. Here the details are\r\nample, showing how from the beginning this august trust has dropped to\r\nbe a personal indulgence, where palace-cars, fast horses, and seaside\r\nloiterings figure more than duties; how personal aims and objects have\r\nbeen more prominent than the public interest; how the Presidential\r\noffice has been used to advance his own family on a scale of nepotism\r\ndwarfing everything of the kind in our history, and hardly equalled\r\nin the corrupt governments where this abuse has most prevailed; how\r\nin the same spirit office has been conferred upon those from whom he\r\nhad received gifts or benefits, thus making the country repay his\r\npersonal obligations; how personal devotion to himself, rather than\r\npublic or party service, has been made the standard of favor; how the\r\nvast appointing power conferred by the Constitution for the general\r\nwelfare has been employed at his will to promote his schemes, to reward\r\nhis friends, to punish his opponents, and to advance his election to\r\na second term; how all these assumptions have matured in a _personal\r\ngovernment_, semi-military in character and breathing the military\r\nspirit,--being a species of Cæsarism or _personalism_, abhorrent to\r\nrepublican institutions, where subservience to the President is the\r\nsupreme law; how in maintaining this subservience he has operated by\r\na system of combinations, military, political, and even senatorial,\r\nhaving their orbits about him, so that, like the planet Saturn, he is\r\nsurrounded by rings,--nor does the similitude end here, for his rings,\r\nlike those of the planet, are held in position by satellites; how\r\nthis utterly unrepublican Cæsarism has mastered the Republican Party\r\nand dictated the Presidential will, stalking into the Senate Chamber\r\nitself, while a vindictive spirit visits good Republicans who cannot\r\nsubmit; how the President himself, unconscious that a President has\r\nno right to quarrel with anybody, insists upon quarrelling until he\r\nhas become the great Presidential quarreller, with more quarrels than\r\nall other Presidents together, all begun and continued by himself; how\r\nhis personal followers back him in quarrels, insult those he insults,\r\nand then, not departing from his spirit, cry out, with Shakespeare,\r\n“We will have _rings_ and things and fine array”; and, finally, how\r\nthe chosen head of the Republic is known chiefly for Presidential\r\npretensions, utterly indefensible in character, derogatory to the\r\ncountry, and of evil influence, making personal objects a primary\r\npursuit, so that, instead of a beneficent presence, he is a bad\r\nexample, through whom republican institutions suffer and the people\r\nlearn to do wrong.\r\n\r\nWould that these things could be forgotten! but since through\r\nofficious friends the President insists upon a second term, they must\r\nbe considered and publicly discussed. When understood, nobody will\r\nvindicate them. It is easy to see that Cæsarism even in Europe is at a\r\ndiscount, that “personal government” has been beaten on that ancient\r\nfield, and that “Cæsar with a Senate at his heels” is not the fit\r\nmodel for our Republic. King George the Third of England, so peculiar\r\nfor narrowness and obstinacy, had retainers in Parliament who went\r\nunder the name of “The King’s Friends.” Nothing can be allowed here to\r\njustify the inquiry, “Have we a King George among us?”--or that other\r\nquestion, “Have we a party in the Senate of ‘The King’s Friends’?”\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONAL GOVERNMENT UNREPUBLICAN.\r\n\r\nPersonal Government is autocratic. It is the One-Man Power elevated\r\nabove all else, and is therefore in direct conflict with republican\r\ngovernment, whose consummate form is tripartite, being executive,\r\nlegislative, and judicial,--each independent and coëqual. From Mr.\r\nMadison, in “The Federalist,” we learn that the accumulation of\r\nthese powers “in the same hands” may justly be pronounced “the very\r\ndefinition of Tyranny.”[47] And so any attempt by either to exercise\r\nthe powers of another is a tyrannical invasion, always reprehensible\r\nin proportion to its extent. John Adams tells us, in most instructive\r\nwords, that “it is by balancing each of these powers against the other\r\ntwo that the efforts in human nature towards tyranny can alone be\r\nchecked and restrained, and any degree of freedom preserved in the\r\nConstitution.”[48]\r\n\r\nThen, again, the same authority says that the perfection of this\r\ngreat idea is “by giving each division a power to defend itself by a\r\nnegative.”[49] In other words, each is armed against invasion by the\r\nothers. Accordingly, the Constitution of Virginia, in 1776, famous\r\nas an historical precedent, declared expressly: “The legislative,\r\nexecutive, and judiciary departments shall be separate and distinct, so\r\nthat neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the other; nor\r\nshall any person exercise the powers of more than one of them at the\r\nsame time.”[50]\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of Massachusetts, dating from 1780, embodied the same\r\nprinciple in memorable words: “In the government of this Commonwealth,\r\nthe legislative department shall never exercise the executive and\r\njudicial powers, or either of them; the executive shall never exercise\r\nthe legislative and judicial powers, or either of them; the judicial\r\nshall never exercise the legislative and executive powers, or either of\r\nthem: to the end it may be a government of laws and not of men.”[51]\r\n\r\nA government of laws and not of men is the object of republican\r\ngovernment; nay, more, it is the distinctive essence without which it\r\nbecomes a tyranny. Therefore personal government in all its forms,\r\nand especially when it seeks to sway the action of any other branch\r\nor overturn its constitutional negative, is hostile to the first\r\nprinciples of republican institutions, and an unquestionable outrage.\r\nThat our President has offended in this way is unhappily too apparent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT AS A CIVILIAN.\r\n\r\nTo comprehend the personal government that has been installed\r\nover us we must know its author. His picture is the necessary\r\nfrontispiece,--not as soldier, let it be borne in mind, but as\r\ncivilian. The President is titular head of the Army and Navy of the\r\nUnited States, but his office is not military or naval. As if to\r\nexclude all question, he is classed by the Constitution among “civil\r\nofficers.” Therefore as civilian is he to be seen. Then, perhaps, may\r\nwe learn the secret of the policy so adverse to republicanism in which\r\nhe perseveres.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate his peculiar character as a civilian it is important to\r\nknow his triumphs as a soldier, for the one is the natural complement\r\nof the other. The successful soldier is rarely changed to the\r\nsuccessful civilian. There seems an incompatibility between the two,\r\nmodified by the extent to which one has been allowed to exclude the\r\nother. One always a soldier cannot late in life become a statesman; one\r\nalways a civilian cannot late in life become a soldier. Education and\r\nexperience are needed for each. Washington and Jackson were civilians\r\nas well as soldiers.\r\n\r\nIn the large training and experience of Antiquity the soldier and\r\ncivilian were often united; but in modern times this has been seldom.\r\nThe camp is peculiar in the influence it exercises; it is in itself\r\nan education; but it is not the education of the statesman. To\r\nsuppose that we can change without preparation from the soldier to\r\nthe statesman is to assume that training and experience are of less\r\nconsequence for the one than the other,--that a man may be born a\r\nstatesman, but can fit himself as a soldier only by four years at West\r\nPoint, careful scientific study, the command of troops, and experience\r\nin the tented field. And is nothing required for the statesman? Is his\r\nduty so slight? His study is the nation and its welfare, turning always\r\nto history for example, to law for authority, and to the loftiest truth\r\nfor rules of conduct. No knowledge, care, or virtue, disciplined by\r\nhabit, can be too great. The pilot is not accepted in his trust until\r\nhe knows the signs of the storm, the secrets of navigation, the rocks\r\nof the coast,--all of which are learned only by careful study with\r\ncharts and soundings, by coasting the land and watching the crested\r\nwave. But can less be expected of that other pilot who is to steer the\r\nship which contains us all?\r\n\r\nThe failure of the modern soldier as statesman is exhibited by Mr.\r\nBuckle in his remarkable work on the “History of Civilization.” Writing\r\nas a philosopher devoted to liberal ideas, he does not disguise that\r\nin Antiquity “the most eminent soldiers were likewise the most eminent\r\npoliticians”; but he plainly shows the reason when he adds, that\r\n“in the midst of the hurry and turmoil of camps these eminent men\r\ncultivated their minds to the highest point that the knowledge of that\r\nage would allow.”[52] The secret was culture not confined to war. In\r\nmodern Europe few soldiers have been more conspicuous than Gustavus\r\nAdolphus and Frederick sometimes called the Great; but we learn from\r\nour author that both “failed ignominiously in their domestic policy,\r\nand showed themselves as short-sighted in the arts of peace as they\r\nwere sagacious in the arts of war.”[53] The judgment of Marlborough\r\nis more pointed. While portraying him as “the greatest conqueror of\r\nhis age, the hero of a hundred fights, the victor of Blenheim and\r\nof Ramillies,” the same philosophical writer adds that he was “a\r\nman not only of the most idle and frivolous pursuits, but was so\r\nmiserably ignorant that his deficiencies made him the ridicule of his\r\ncontemporaries,” while his politics were compounded of selfishness and\r\ntreachery.[54] Nor was Wellington an exception. Though shining in the\r\nfield without a rival, and remarkable for integrity of purpose, an\r\nunflinching honesty, and high moral feeling, the conqueror of Waterloo\r\nis described as “nevertheless utterly unequal to the complicated\r\nexigencies of political life.”[55] This judgment of the philosopher\r\nis confirmed by that of Metternich, the renowned statesman, who, after\r\nencountering Wellington at the Congresses of Vienna and Verona, did not\r\nhesitate to write of him as “the great Baby.”[56] Such are the examples\r\nof history, each with its warning.\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to find anything in the native endowments or in\r\nthe training of our chieftain to make him an illustrious exception;\r\nat least nothing of this kind is recorded. Was Nature more generous\r\nwith him than with Marlborough or Wellington, Gustavus Adolphus or\r\nFrederick called the Great? or was his experience of life a better\r\npreparation than theirs? And yet they failed, except in war. It is not\r\nknown that our chieftain had any experience as a civilian until he\r\nbecame President, nor does any partisan attribute to him that double\r\nculture which in Antiquity made the same man soldier and statesman.\r\nIt has often been said that he took no note of public affairs, never\r\nvoting but once in his life, and then for James Buchanan. After leaving\r\nWest Point he became a captain in the Army, but soon abandoned the\r\nservice, to reappear at a later day as a successful general. There is\r\nno reason to believe that he employed this intermediate period in any\r\nway calculated to improve him as a statesman. One of his unhesitating\r\nsupporters, my colleague, [Mr. WILSON,] in a speech intended to\r\ncommend him for reëlection, says: “Before the war we knew nothing of\r\nGrant. He was earning a few hundred dollars a year in tanning hides\r\nin Galena.”[57] By the war he passed to be President; and such was\r\nhis preparation to govern the Great Republic, making it an example\r\nto mankind! Thus he learned to deal with all questions, domestic\r\nand foreign, whether of peace or war, to declare Constitutional Law\r\nand International Law, and to administer the vast appointing power,\r\ncreating Cabinet officers, judges, foreign ministers, and an uncounted\r\narmy of office-holders!\r\n\r\nTo these things must be added, that when this soldier first began as\r\ncivilian he was already forty-six years old. At this mature age, close\r\nupon half a century, when habits are irrevocably fixed, when the mind\r\nhas hardened against what is new, when the character has taken its\r\npermanent form, and the whole man is rooted in his own unchangeable\r\nindividuality, our soldier entered abruptly upon the untried life of a\r\ncivilian in its most exalted sphere. Do not be surprised, that, like\r\nother soldiers, he failed; the wonder would be had he succeeded. There\r\nis a French saying, that at forty a man has given his measure. At least\r\nhis vocation is settled,--how completely is seen, if we suppose the\r\nstatesman, after traversing the dividing point, abruptly changed to\r\nthe soldier. And yet at an age nearly seven years later our soldier\r\nprecipitately changed to the statesman.\r\n\r\nThis sudden metamorphosis cannot be forgotten, when we seek to\r\ncomprehend the strange pretensions which ensued. It is easy to see how\r\nsome very moderate experience in civil life, involving of course the\r\nlesson of subordination to republican principles, would have prevented\r\nindefensible acts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF THE LATE EDWIN M. STANTON.\r\n\r\nSomething also must be attributed to individual character. And here I\r\nexpress no opinion of my own; I shall allow another to speak in solemn\r\nwords echoed from the tomb.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Washington at the opening of Congress in December, 1869,\r\nI was pained to hear that Mr. Stanton, lately Secretary of War, was\r\nin failing health. Full of gratitude for his unsurpassed services,\r\nand with a sentiment of friendship quickened by common political\r\nsympathies, I lost no time in seeing him, and repeated my visits until\r\nhis death, toward the close of the same month. My last visit was marked\r\nby a communication never to be forgotten. As I entered his bedroom,\r\nwhere I found him reclining on a sofa, propped by pillows, he reached\r\nout his hand, already clammy cold, and in reply to my inquiry, “How\r\nare you?” answered, “Waiting for my furlough.” Then at once, with\r\nsingular solemnity, he said, “I have something to say to you.” When\r\nI was seated, he proceeded without one word of introduction: “I know\r\nGeneral Grant better than any other person in the country can know him.\r\nIt was my duty to study him, and I did so night and day, when I saw him\r\nand when I did not see him; and now I tell you what I know: _he cannot\r\ngovern this country_.” The intensity of his manner and the positiveness\r\nof his judgment surprised me; for, though I was aware that the late\r\nSecretary of War did not place the President very high in general\r\ncapacity, I was not prepared for a judgment so strongly couched. At\r\nlast, after some delay, occupied in meditating his remarkable words,\r\nI observed, “What you say is very broad.” “It is as true as it is\r\nbroad,” he replied promptly. I added, “You are tardy; you tell this\r\nlate: why did you not say it before his nomination?” He answered, that\r\nhe was not consulted about the nomination, and had no opportunity of\r\nexpressing his opinion upon it, besides being much occupied at the time\r\nby his duties as Secretary of War and his contest with the President.\r\nI followed by saying, “But you took part in the Presidential election,\r\nand made a succession of speeches for him in Ohio and Pennsylvania.”\r\n“I spoke,” said he, “but I never introduced the name of General Grant.\r\nI spoke for the Republican Party and the Republican cause.” This was\r\nthe last time I saw Mr. Stanton. A few days later I followed him to the\r\ngrave where he now rests. As the vagaries of the President became more\r\nmanifest, and the Presidential office seemed more and more a plaything\r\nand perquisite, this dying judgment of the great citizen who knew him\r\nso well haunted me constantly, day and night; and I now communicate\r\nit to my country, feeling that it is a legacy which I have no right\r\nto withhold. Beyond the intrinsic interest from its author, it is not\r\nwithout value as testimony in considering how the President could have\r\nbeen led into that Quixotism of personal pretension which it is my duty\r\nto expose.[58]\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTY TO MAKE EXPOSURE.\r\n\r\nPardon me, if I repeat that it is my duty to make this exposure,\r\nspreading before you the proofs of that personal government, which will\r\nonly pass without censure when it passes without observation. Insisting\r\nupon reëlection, the President challenges inquiry and puts himself upon\r\nthe country. But even if his pressure for reëlection did not menace\r\nthe tranquillity of the country, it is important that the personal\r\npretensions he has set up should be exposed, that no President\r\nhereafter may venture upon such ways, and no Senator presume to defend\r\nthem. The case is clear as noon.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO TYPICAL INSTANCES.\r\n\r\nIn opening this catalogue I select two typical instances,--Nepotism,\r\nand Gift-Taking with repayment by office, each absolutely indefensible\r\nin the head of a Republic, most pernicious in example, and showing\r\nbeyond question that surpassing egotism which changed the Presidential\r\noffice into a personal instrumentality, not unlike the trunk of an\r\nelephant, apt for all things, small as well as great, from provision\r\nfor a relation to forcing a treaty on a reluctant Senate, or forcing a\r\nreëlection on a reluctant people.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEPOTISM OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nBetween these two typical instances I hesitate which to place foremost:\r\nbut since the nepotism of the President is a ruling passion, revealing\r\nthe primary instincts of his nature,--since it is maintained by him\r\nin utter unconsciousness of its offensive character,--since, instead\r\nof blushing for it as an unhappy mistake, he continues to uphold\r\nit,--since it has been openly defended by Senators on this floor,--and\r\nsince no true patriot anxious for republican institutions can doubt\r\nthat it ought to be driven with hissing and scorn from all possibility\r\nof repetition,--I begin with this undoubted abuse.\r\n\r\nThere has been no call of Congress for a return of the relations\r\nholding office, stipend, or money-making opportunity under the\r\nPresident. The country is left to the press for information on this\r\nimportant subject. If there is any exaggeration, the President is\r\nin fault,--since, knowing the discreditable allegations, he has not\r\nhastened to furnish the precise facts, or at least his partisans have\r\nfailed in not calling for the official information. In the mood which\r\nthey have shown in this Chamber, it is evident that any resolution\r\ncalling for it, moved by a Senator not known to be for his reëlection,\r\nwould meet with opposition, and an effort to vindicate republican\r\ninstitutions would be denounced as an assault on the President. But\r\nthe newspapers have placed enough beyond question for judgment on this\r\nextraordinary case, although thus far there has been no attempt to\r\nappreciate it, especially in the light of history.\r\n\r\nOne list makes the number of beneficiaries as many as forty-two,\r\nbeing probably every known person allied to the President by blood or\r\nmarriage. Persons seeming to speak for the President, or at least after\r\ncareful inquiries, have denied the accuracy of this list, reducing it\r\nto thirteen. It will not be questioned that there is at least a baker’s\r\ndozen in this category,--thirteen relations of the President billeted\r\non the country, not one of whom but for this relationship would have\r\nbeen brought forward, the whole constituting a case of nepotism not\r\nunworthy of those worst governments where office is a family possession.\r\n\r\nBeyond the list of thirteen are other revelations, showing that this\r\nstrange abuse did not stop with the President’s relations, but that\r\nthese obtained appointments for others in their circle,--so that every\r\nrelation became a centre of influence, while the Presidential family\r\nextended indefinitely.\r\n\r\nHitherto only one President has appointed relations, and that was\r\nJohn Adams; but he found public opinion, inspired by the example of\r\nWashington, so strong against it, that, after a slight experiment,\r\nhe replied to an applicant, “You know it is impossible for me to\r\nappoint my own relations to anything, without drawing forth a torrent\r\nof obloquy.”[59] The judgment of the country found voice in Thomas\r\nJefferson, who, in a letter written shortly after he became President,\r\nused these strong words: “Mr. Adams _degraded himself infinitely_ by\r\nhis conduct on this subject.”[60] But John Adams, besides transferring\r\nhis son John Quincy Adams from one diplomatic post to another,\r\nappointed only two relations. Pray, Sir, what words would Jefferson\r\nuse, if he were here to speak on the open and multifarious nepotism of\r\nour President?\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN AND HISTORY OF NEPOTISM.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential pretension is so important in every aspect, and the\r\ncharacter of republican institutions is so absolutely compromised by\r\nits toleration, that it cannot be treated in any perfunctory way. It\r\nshall not be my fault, if hereafter there is any doubt with regard to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe word “Nepotism” is of Italian origin. First appearing at Rome when\r\nthe Papal power was at its height, it served to designate the authority\r\nand influence exercised by the nephews, or more generally the family,\r\nof a Pope: all the family of a Pope were nephews, and the Pope was\r\nuniversal uncle. From Italian the word passed into other European\r\nlanguages, but in the lapse of time or process of naturalization it\r\nhas come to denote the misconduct of the appointing power, and has\r\namplified so as to embrace others besides Popes who appoint relations\r\nto office. Johnson in his Dictionary defines it simply as “Fondness for\r\nnephews”; but our latest and best lexicographer, Worcester, supplies\r\na definition more complete and satisfactory: “Favoritism shown to\r\nrelations; patronage bestowed _in consideration of family relationship\r\nand not of merit_.” Such undoubtedly is the meaning of the word as now\r\nreceived and employed.\r\n\r\nThe character of this pretension appears in its origin and history.\r\nAs far back as 1667 this undoubted abuse occupied attention to such a\r\ndegree that it became the subject of an able historical work, entitled\r\n“Il Nipotismo di Roma,” which is full of instruction and warning even\r\nfor our Republic. In the early days of the Church Popes are described\r\nas discarding all relationship, whether of blood or alliance, and\r\ninclining to merit alone in their appointments, although there were\r\nsome with so large a number of nephews, grand-nephews, brothers-in-law,\r\nand relations, as to baffle belief; and yet it is recorded that no\r\nsooner did the good Pope enter the Vatican, which is the Executive\r\nMansion of Rome, than relations fled, brothers-in-law hid themselves,\r\ngrand-nephews removed away, and nephews got at a long distance.[61]\r\nSuch was the early virtue. Nepotism did not exist, and the word itself\r\nwas unknown.\r\n\r\nAt last, in 1471, twenty-one years before the discovery of America\r\nby Columbus, Sixtus the Fourth became Pope, and with him began that\r\nnepotism which soon became famous as a Roman institution.[62] Born\r\nin 1414, the son of a fisherman, the eminent founder was already\r\nfifty-seven years old, and he reigned thirteen years, bringing to his\r\nfunctions large experience as a successful preacher and as general of\r\nthe Franciscan friars. Though cradled in poverty, and by the vows of\r\nhis Order bound to mendicancy, he began at once to heap office and\r\nriches upon the various members of his family, so that his conduct,\r\nfrom its barefaced inconsistency with the obligation of his life,\r\nexcited, according to the historian, “the amazement and wonder of\r\nall.”[63] The useful reforms he attempted are forgotten, and this\r\nremarkable pontiff is chiefly remembered now as the earliest nepotist.\r\nDifferent degrees of severity are employed by different authors in\r\ncharacterizing this unhappy fame. Bouillet, in his Dictionary of\r\nHistory,[64] having Catholic approbation, describes him as “feeble\r\ntoward his nephews”; and our own Cyclopædia,[65] in a brief exposition\r\nof his character, says “he made himself odious by excessive nepotism.”\r\nBut in all varieties of expression the offence stands out for judgment.\r\n\r\nThe immediate successor of Sixtus was Innocent the Eighth, whom the\r\nhistorian describes as “very cold to his relations,”[66] since three\r\nonly obtained preferment at his hands. But the example of the founder\r\nso far prevailed that for a century nepotism, as was said, “lorded it\r\nin Rome,”[67] except in a few instances worthy of commemoration and\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nOf these exceptions, the first in time was Julius the Second, founder\r\nof St. Peter’s at Rome, whose remarkable countenance is so beautifully\r\npreserved by the genius of Rafael. Though the nephew of the nepotist,\r\nand not declining to appoint all relations, he did it with such\r\nmoderation that Rome was said to have been “almost without nepotism”\r\nin his time.[68] Adrian the Sixth, early teacher of Charles the Fifth,\r\nand successor of Leo the Tenth, set a better example by refusing\r\nabsolutely; but so accustomed had Rome become to this abuse, that not\r\nonly the ambassadors, but the people, condemned him as “too rude” with\r\nhis relations. A son of his cousin, studying in Siena, started for\r\nRome, trusting to obtain important recognition; but the Pope, without\r\nseeing him, sent him back on a hired horse. Relations thronged from\r\nother places, and even from across the Alps, longing for that greatness\r\nwhich other Popes had lavished on family; but Adrian dismissed them\r\nwith a slight change of clothing and an allowance of money for the\r\njourney: one who from poverty came on foot was permitted to return on\r\nfoot. This Pope carried abnegation of his family so far as to make\r\nrelationship an excuse for not rewarding one who had served the Church\r\nwell.[69] Similar in character was Marcellus the Second, who became\r\nPope in 1555. He was unwilling that any of his family should come to\r\nRome; even his brother was forbidden: but this good example was closed\r\nby death, after a reign of twenty days only; and yet this brief period\r\nof exemplary virtue has made this pontiff famous. Kindred in spirit was\r\nUrban the Seventh, who reigned thirteen days only in 1590, but long\r\nenough to repel his relations,--and also Leo the Eleventh, who reigned\r\ntwenty-five days in 1605. To this list may be added Innocent the Ninth,\r\nwho died after two months of service. It is related that his death\r\ndispleased his relations much, and dissolved the air-castles they had\r\nbuilt. They had hurried from Bologna, but, except a grand-nephew, all\r\nwere obliged to return poor as they came.[70] In this list I must not\r\nforget Pius the Fifth, who reigned from 1566 to 1572. He set himself\r\nso completely against aggrandizing his own family, that he was with\r\ndifficulty persuaded to make a sister’s son cardinal,--and would\r\nnot have done it, had not all the cardinals united, on grounds of\r\nconscience, against the denial of this dignity to one most worthy of\r\nit.[71] Such virtue was part of that elevated character which caused\r\nhis subsequent canonization.\r\n\r\nThese good Popes were short-lived,--their reigns for the most\r\npart counting by days only; but they opened happy glimpses of an\r\nadministration where the powers of government were not treated as a\r\npersonal perquisite. The opposite list had the advantage of time.\r\n\r\nConspicuous among nepotists was Alexander the Sixth, whose family name\r\nof Borgia is damned to fame. With him nepotism assumed its most brutal\r\nand barbarous development, reflecting the character of its pontifical\r\nauthor, who was without the smallest ray of good. Other Popes were\r\nless cruel and bloody, but not less determined in providing for their\r\nfamilies. Paul the Third, who was of the great house of Farnese, would\r\nhave had the estates of the Church a garden for the “lilies” which\r\nflourish on the escutcheon of his family.[72] It is related that when\r\nUrban the Eighth, who was a Barberini, began his historic reign, all\r\nhis relations at a distance flew to Rome like the “bees” on the family\r\narms, to suck the honey of the Church, but not leaving behind the\r\nsting with which they pricked while they sucked.[73] Whether lilies\r\nor bees, it was the same. The latter pontiff gave to nepotism fulness\r\nof power when he resolved “to have no business with any one not\r\ndependent upon his house.”[74] In the same spirit he excused himself\r\nfrom making a man cardinal because he had “always been the enemy of\r\nhis nephews.”[75] Although nothing so positive is recorded of Paul the\r\nFifth, who was a Borghese, his nepotism appears in the Roman saying,\r\nthat, “while serving the Church as a good shepherd, he gave too much\r\nwool to his nephews.”[76] These instructive incidents, illustrating\r\nthe pontifical pretension, reflect light on the history of palaces and\r\ngalleries at Rome, now admired by the visitor from distant lands. If\r\nnot created, they were at least enlarged by nepotism.\r\n\r\nIt does not always appear how many relations a Pope endowed. Often\r\nit was all, as in the case of Gregory the Thirteenth, who, besides\r\nadvancing a nephew actually at Rome, called thither all his nephews and\r\ngrand-nephews, whether from brothers or sisters, and gave them offices,\r\ndignities, governments, lordships, prelacies, and abbacies.[77] Cæsar\r\nBorgia and his sister Lucretia were not the only relations of Alexander\r\nthe Sixth. I do not find the number adopted by Sixtus, the founder of\r\nthe system. Pius the Fourth, who was of the grasping Medicean family,\r\nfavored no less than twenty-five.[78] Alexander the Seventh, of the\r\nChigi family, had about him five nephews and one brother, which a\r\ncontemporary characterized as “nepotism all complete.”[79] This pontiff\r\nbegan his reign by forbidding his relations to appear at Rome, which\r\nredounded at once to his credit throughout the Christian world, while\r\nthe astonished people discoursed of his holiness and the purity of his\r\nlife, expecting even to see miracles. In making the change, he yielded\r\nevidently to immoral pressure and the example of predecessors.\r\n\r\nThe performances of papal nephews figure in history. After the Borgias\r\nwere the Caraffas, who obtained power through Paul the Fourth; but at\r\nlast becoming too insolent and rapacious, their uncle was compelled to\r\nstrip them of their dignities and drive them from Rome.[80] Sometimes\r\nnephews were employed chiefly in ministering to pontifical pleasures,\r\nas in the case of Julius the Third, who, according to the historian,\r\n“thought of nothing but banqueting with this one and that one, keeping\r\nhis relations in Rome rather to accompany him at banquets than to\r\naid him in the government of the holy Church, about which he thought\r\nlittle.”[81] This occasion for relations does not exist at Rome now, as\r\nthe pontiff leads a discreet life, always at home, and never banquets\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nThese historic instances make us see nepotism in its original\r\nseat. Would you know how it was regarded there? Sometimes it was\r\ncalled a hydra with many heads, sprouting anew at the election of a\r\npontiff,[82] then again it was called Ottoman rather than Christian\r\nin character.[83] The contemporary historian who has described it so\r\nminutely says that those who merely read of it without seeing it will\r\nfind it difficult to believe or even imagine.[84] The qualities of a\r\nPope’s relation were said to be “ignorance and cunning.”[85] It is easy\r\nto believe that this prostitution of the head of the Church was one\r\nof the abuses which excited the cry for Reform, and awakened even in\r\nRome the echoes of Martin Luther. A Swedish nobleman visiting Rome is\r\nrecorded as declaring himself unwilling to be the subject of a pontiff\r\nwho was himself the subject of his own relations.[86] But even this\r\npretension was not without open defenders, while the general effrontery\r\nwith which it was maintained assumed that it was above question. If\r\nsome gave with eyes closed, most gave with eyes open. It was said that\r\nPopes were not to neglect their own blood, that they should not show\r\nthemselves worse than the beasts, not one of which fails to caress its\r\nrelations; and the case of bears and lions, the most ferocious of all,\r\nwas cited as authority for this recognition of one’s own blood.[87]\r\nAll this was soberly said, and it is doubtless true. Not even a Pope\r\ncan justly neglect his own blood; but help and charity must be at his\r\nown expense, and not at the expense of his country. In appointments to\r\noffice, merit and not blood is the only just recommendation.\r\n\r\nThat nepotism has ceased to lord itself in Rome, that no pontiff\r\nbillets his relations upon the Church, that the appointing power\r\nof the Pope is treated as a public trust and not as a personal\r\nperquisite,--all this is the present testimony with regard to that\r\ngovernment which knows from experience the baneful character of this\r\nabuse.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN AUTHORITIES ON NEPOTISM.\r\n\r\nThe nepotism of Rome was little known in our country, and I do not\r\ndoubt that Washington, when declining to make the Presidential office\r\na personal perquisite, was governed by that instinct of duty and\r\npatriotism which rendered him so preëminent. Through all the perils of\r\na seven years’ war he had battled with that kingly rule which elevates\r\na whole family without regard to merit, fastening all upon the nation,\r\nand he had learned that this royal system could find no place in a\r\nrepublic. Therefore he rejected the claims of relations, and in nothing\r\nwas his example more beautiful. His latest biographer, Washington\r\nIrving, records him as saying:--\r\n\r\n    “So far as I know my own mind, I would not be in the remotest\r\n    degree influenced in making nominations by motives arising from the\r\n    ties of family or blood.”[88]\r\n\r\nThen again he declared his purpose to “discharge the duties of the\r\noffice with that impartiality and zeal for the public good which ought\r\nnever to suffer connections of blood or friendship to intermingle so as\r\nto have the least sway on decisions of a public nature.”[89]\r\n\r\nThis excellent rule of conduct is illustrated by the advice to his\r\nsuccessor with regard to the promotion of his son, John Quincy Adams.\r\nAfter giving it as his “decided opinion” that the latter “is the most\r\nvaluable public character we have abroad,” and promises to be “the\r\nablest of all our diplomatic corps,” Washington declares:--\r\n\r\n    “If he was now to be brought into that line, or into any other\r\n    public walk, I could not, upon the principle which has regulated my\r\n    own conduct, disapprove of the caution which is hinted at in the\r\n    letter.”[90]\r\n\r\nConsidering the importance of the rule, it were better for the country\r\nif it had prevailed over parental regard and the extraordinary merits\r\nof the son.\r\n\r\nIn vindicating his conduct at a later day, John Adams protested against\r\nwhat he called “the hypersuperlative public virtue” of Washington,\r\nand insisted: “A President ought not to appoint a man because he is\r\nhis relation; nor ought he to refuse or neglect to appoint him for\r\nthat reason.”[91] With absolute certainty that the President is above\r\nall prejudice of family and sensitive to merit only, this rule is not\r\nunreasonable; but who can be trusted to apply it?\r\n\r\nJefferson developed and explained the true principles in a manner\r\nworthy of republican institutions. In a letter to a relation\r\nimmediately after becoming President, he wrote:\r\n\r\n    “The public will never be made to believe that an appointment of\r\n    a relative is made on the ground of merit alone, uninfluenced by\r\n    family views; _nor can they ever see with approbation offices,\r\n    the disposal of which they intrust to their Presidents for public\r\n    purposes, divided out as family property_. Mr. Adams degraded\r\n    himself infinitely by his conduct on this subject, as General\r\n    Washington had done himself the greatest honor. With two such\r\n    examples to proceed by, I should be doubly inexcusable to err.”[92]\r\n\r\nAfter his retirement from the Presidency, in a letter to a kinsman, he\r\nasserts the rule again:--\r\n\r\n    “Towards acquiring the confidence of the people, the very first\r\n    measure is to satisfy them of his disinterestedness, and that he is\r\n    directing their affairs with a single eye to their good, and not to\r\n    build up fortunes for himself and family; and especially that the\r\n    officers appointed to transact their business are appointed because\r\n    they are the fittest men, not because they are his relations. So\r\n    prone are they to suspicion, that, where a President appoints a\r\n    relation of his own, however worthy, they will believe that favor,\r\n    and not merit, was the motive. I therefore laid it down as a law of\r\n    conduct for myself, never to give an appointment to a relation.”[93]\r\n\r\nThat statement is unanswerable. The elect of the people must live so as\r\nbest to maintain their interests and to elevate the national sentiment.\r\nThis can be only by an example of unselfish devotion to the public weal\r\nwhich shall be above suspicion. A President suspected of weakness for\r\nhis relations is already shorn of strength.\r\n\r\nIn saying that his predecessor “degraded himself infinitely by\r\nhis conduct on this subject,” Jefferson shows the rigor of his\r\nrequirement. Besides the transfer of his son, John Quincy Adams, from\r\none diplomatic mission of lower grade to another of a higher, John\r\nAdams is responsible for the appointment of his son-in-law, Colonel\r\nSmith, as surveyor of the port of New York, and his wife’s nephew,\r\nWilliam Cranch, as chief-justice of the Circuit Court of the District\r\nof Columbia,--both persons of merit, and the former “serving through\r\nthe war with high applause of his superiors.”[94] The public sentiment\r\nappears in the condemnation of these appointments. In refusing another\r\nof his relations, we have already seen[95] that John Adams wrote:\r\n“You know it is impossible for me to appoint my own relations to\r\nanything without drawing forth a torrent of obloquy.” But this torrent\r\nwas nothing but the judgment of the American people unwilling that\r\nrepublican institutions at that early day should suffer.\r\n\r\nThus far John Adams stands alone. If any other President has made\r\nappointments from his own family, it has been on so petty a scale as\r\nnot to be recognized in history. John Quincy Adams, when President, did\r\nnot follow his father. An early letter to his mother foreshadows a rule\r\nnot unlike that of Jefferson:--\r\n\r\n    “I hope, my ever dear and honored mother, that you are fully\r\n    convinced from my letters, which you have before this received,\r\n    that upon the contingency of my father’s being placed in the first\r\n    magistracy I shall never give him any trouble by solicitation\r\n    for office of any kind. Your late letters have repeated so many\r\n    times that I shall in that case have nothing to _expect_, that\r\n    I am afraid you have imagined it possible that I _might_ form\r\n    expectations from such an event. I had hoped that _my mother_ knew\r\n    me better; that she did me the justice to believe that I have not\r\n    been so totally regardless or forgetful of the principles which my\r\n    education had instilled, nor so totally destitute of a _personal_\r\n    sense of delicacy, as to be susceptible of a wish tending in that\r\n    direction.”[96]\r\n\r\nTo Jefferson’s sense of public duty John Quincy Adams added the\r\nsense of personal delicacy, both strong against such appointment of\r\nrelations. To the irresistible judgment against this abuse, a recent\r\nmoralist, of lofty nature, Theodore Parker, imparts new expression,\r\nwhen he says, “It is a dangerous and unjust practice.”[97] This is\r\nsimple and monitory.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL APOLOGIES FOR NEPOTISM.\r\n\r\nWithout the avalanche of testimony against this Presidential\r\npretension, it is necessary only to glance at the defences sometimes\r\nset up; for such is the insensibility bred by Presidential example,\r\nthat even this intolerable outrage is not without voices speaking\r\nfor the President. Sometimes it is said, that, his salary being far\r\nfrom royal, the people will not scan closely an attempt to help\r\nrelations,--which, being interpreted, means that the President may\r\nsupplement the pettiness of his salary by the appointing power. Let\r\nJohn Adams, who did not hesitate to bestow office upon a few relations\r\nof unquestioned merit, judge this pretension. I quote his words:--\r\n\r\n    “Every public man should be honestly paid for his services.… But he\r\n    should be restrained from every _perquisite_ not known to the laws,\r\n    and he should make no claims upon the gratitude of the public, nor\r\n    ever confer an office within his patronage upon a son, a brother, a\r\n    friend, upon pretence that he is not paid for his services by the\r\n    profits of his office.”[98]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to deny the soundness of this requirement and its\r\ncompleteness as an answer to one of the apologies.\r\n\r\nSometimes the defender is more audacious, insisting openly upon the\r\nPresidential prerogative without question, until we seem to hear in\r\naggravated form the obnoxious cry, “To the victor belong the spoils.”\r\nI did not suppose that this old cry could be revived in any form;\r\nbut since it is heard again, I choose to expose it; and here I use\r\nthe language of Madison, whose mild wisdom has illumined so much of\r\nconstitutional duty. In his judgment the pretension was odious, “that\r\noffices and emoluments were the spoils of victory, _the personal\r\nproperty_ of the successful candidate for the Presidency”; and he adds\r\nin words not to be forgotten at this moment:--\r\n\r\n    “The principle, if avowed without the practice, or\r\n    practised without the avowal, could not fail to degrade any\r\n    Administration,--both together, completely so.”[99]\r\n\r\nThis is strong language. The rule in its early form could not fail to\r\ndegrade any Administration. But now this degrading rule is extended,\r\nand we are told that to the President’s family belong the spoils.\r\n\r\nAnother apology, vouchsafed even on this floor, is, that, if the\r\nPresident cannot appoint his relations, they alone of all citizens\r\nare excluded from office,--which, it is said, should not be. But is\r\nit not for the public good that they should be excluded? Such was the\r\nwise judgment of Jefferson, and such is the testimony from another\r\nquarter. That eminent prelate, Bishop Butler, who has given to English\r\nliterature one of its most masterly productions, known as “Butler’s\r\nAnalogy,” after his elevation to the see of Durham with its remarkable\r\npatronage, was so self-denying with regard to his family that a nephew\r\nsaid to him, “Methinks, my Lord, it is a misfortune to be related to\r\nyou.”[100] Golden words of honor for the English Bishop! But none such\r\nhave been earned by the American President.\r\n\r\nAssuming that in case of positive merit designating a citizen for a\r\nparticular post the President might appoint a relation, it would be\r\nonly where the merit was so shining that his absence would be noticed.\r\nAt least it must be such as to make the citizen a candidate without\r\nregard to family. But no such merit is attributed to the beneficiaries\r\nof our President, some of whom have done little but bring scandal\r\nupon the public service. At least one is tainted with fraud; and\r\nanother, with the commission of the Republic abroad, has been guilty of\r\nindiscretions inconsistent with his trust. Appointed originally in open\r\ndefiance of republican principles, they have been retained in office\r\nafter their unfitness became painfully manifest. By the testimony\r\nbefore a Congressional Committee, one of these, a brother-in-law, was\r\nimplicated in bribery and corruption. It is said that at last, after\r\nconsiderable delay, the President has consented to his removal.\r\n\r\nHere I leave for the present this enormous unrepublican pretension,\r\nwaiting to hear if it can again find an apologist. Is there a single\r\nSenator who will not dismiss it to judgment?\r\n\r\n\r\nGIFT-TAKING,--AND REPAYMENT WITH OFFICE.\r\n\r\nFrom one typical abuse I pass to another. From a dropsical Nepotism\r\nswollen to elephantiasis, which nobody can defend, I pass to\r\nGift-Taking, which with our President has assumed an unprecedented\r\nform. Sometimes public men even in our country have taken gifts,\r\nbut it is not known that any President before has repaid the patron\r\nwith office. For a public man to take gifts is reprehensible; for\r\na President to select Cabinet councillors and other officers among\r\nthose from whom he has taken gifts is an anomaly in republican annals.\r\nObserve, Sir, that I speak of it gently, unwilling to exhibit the\r\nindignation which such a Presidential pretension is calculated to\r\narouse. The country will judge it, and blot it out as an example.\r\n\r\nThere have been throughout history corrupt characters in official\r\nstation; but, whether in ancient or modern times, the testimony is\r\nconstant against the taking of gifts, and nowhere with more force than\r\nin our Scriptures, where it is said: “Thou shalt not wrest judgment,\r\nthou shalt not respect persons, _neither take a gift_; for a gift doth\r\nblind the eyes of the wise.”[101] Here is the inhibition, and also the\r\nreason, which slight observation shows to be true. Does not a gift\r\nblind the eyes of the wise? The influence of gifts is represented by\r\nPlutarch in the life of a Spartan king:--\r\n\r\n    “For he thought those ways of entrapping men by gifts and presents,\r\n    which other kings use, dishonest and inartificial; and it seemed to\r\n    him to be the most noble method and most suitable to a king to win\r\n    the affections of those that came near him by personal intercourse\r\n    and agreeable conversation, since between a friend and a mercenary\r\n    the only distinction is, that we gain the one by one’s character\r\n    and conversation, the other by one’s money.”[102]\r\n\r\nWhat is done under the influence of a gift is mercenary; but whether\r\nfrom ruler to subject or from subject to ruler, the gift is equally\r\npernicious. An ancient patriot “feared the Greeks bearing gifts,”[103]\r\nand these words have become a proverb; but there are Greeks bearing\r\ngifts elsewhere than at Troy. A public man can traffic with such only\r\nat his peril. At their appearance the prayer should be said, “Lead us\r\nnot into temptation.”\r\n\r\nThe best examples testify. Thus, in the autobiography of Lord Brougham,\r\nposthumously published, it appears that at a great meeting in Glasgow\r\nfive hundred pounds were subscribed as a gift to him for his public\r\nservice, to be put into such form as he might think best. He hesitated.\r\n“This required,” he records, “much consideration, as such gifts were\r\nliable to be abused.” Not content with his own judgment, he assembled\r\nsome friends to discuss it,--“Lord Holland, Lord Erskine, Romilly, and\r\nBaring,”--and he wrote to Earl Grey, afterward Prime-Minister, who\r\nreplied:--\r\n\r\n    “Both Grenville and I accepted from the Catholics of Glasgow a\r\n    piece of plate--of no great value indeed--_after we were turned\r\n    out_ in 1807.… If you still feel scruples, I can only add that\r\n    it is impossible to err on the side of delicacy with respect to\r\n    matters of this nature.”\r\n\r\nIt ended in his declining to accept anything more than the small top of\r\na gold inkstand.[104]\r\n\r\nIn our country Washington keeps his lofty heights, setting himself\r\nagainst gift-taking as against nepotism. In 1785, while in private\r\nlife, two years after he ceased to be commander-in-chief of our armies\r\nand four years before he became President, he could not be induced to\r\naccept a certain amount of canal stock offered him by the State of\r\nVirginia, as appears in an official communication:--\r\n\r\n    “It gives me great pleasure to inform you that the Assembly\r\n    yesterday, without a dissenting voice, complimented you with fifty\r\n    shares in the Potomac Company and one hundred in the James River\r\n    Company.”[105]\r\n\r\nFully to appreciate the reply of Washington, it must be borne in mind,\r\nthat, according to Washington Irving, his biographer, “some degree of\r\neconomy was necessary, for his financial concerns had suffered during\r\nthe war, and the products of his estate had fallen off.”[106] But he\r\nwas not tempted. Thus he wrote:--\r\n\r\n    “How would this matter be viewed by the eye of the world, and what\r\n    would be the opinion of it, when it comes to be related that George\r\n    Washington has received twenty thousand dollars and five thousand\r\n    pounds sterling of the public money as an interest therein?…\r\n    Under whatever pretence, and however customarily these gratuitous\r\n    gifts are made in other countries, should I not thenceforward be\r\n    considered as a dependant?”[107]\r\n\r\nAnd subsequently to Jefferson:--\r\n\r\n    “I never for a moment entertained an idea of accepting it.”[108]\r\n\r\nHow admirably he touches the point when he asks, “Should I not\r\nthenceforward be considered as a dependant?” According to our Scripture\r\nthe gift blinds the eyes; according to Washington it makes the receiver\r\na dependant.\r\n\r\nIn harmony with this sentiment was his subsequent refusal, when\r\nPresident, as is recorded by an ingenuous writer:--\r\n\r\n     “He was exceedingly careful about committing himself; _would\r\n    receive no favors of any kind_, and scrupulously paid for\r\n    everything.… A large house was set apart for him on Ninth Street,\r\n    [Philadelphia,] on the grounds now covered by the Pennsylvania\r\n    University, _which he refused to accept_.”[109]\r\n\r\nBy such instances, brought to light recently, and shining in contrast\r\nwith our times, we learn to admire anew the virtue of Washington.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to show how in all ages the refusal of gifts has been\r\nrecognized as the sign of virtue, if not the requirement of duty. The\r\nstory of St. Louis of France is beautiful and suggestive. Leaving on\r\na crusade, he charged the Queen, who remained behind, “not to accept\r\npresents for herself or her children.”[110] Such was one of the\r\ninjunctions by which this monarch, when far away on a pious expedition,\r\nimpressed himself upon his country.\r\n\r\nMy own strong convictions on this Presidential pretension were aroused\r\nin a conversation which it was my privilege to enjoy with John Quincy\r\nAdams, as he sat in his sick-chamber at his son’s house in Boston,\r\na short time before he fell at his post of duty in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. In a voice trembling with age and with emotion,\r\nhe said that no public man could take gifts without peril; and he\r\nconfessed that his own judgment had been quickened by the example of\r\nCount Romanzoff, the eminent Chancellor of the Russian Empire, who,\r\nafter receiving costly gifts from foreign sovereigns with whom he had\r\nnegotiated treaties, felt a difficulty of conscience in keeping them,\r\nand at last handed over their value to a hospital, as he related to Mr.\r\nAdams, then Minister at St. Petersburg.[111] The latter was impressed\r\nby this Russian example, and through his long career, as Minister\r\nabroad, Secretary of State, President, and Representative, always\r\nrefused gifts, unless a book or some small article in its nature a\r\ntoken and not a reward or bribe.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution testifies against the taking of gifts by officers\r\nof the United States, when it provides that “no person holding any\r\noffice of profit or trust under them shall, without the consent of the\r\nCongress, accept of any present or emolument from any king, prince, or\r\nforeign State.” The acceptance of a present or emolument from our own\r\ncitizens was left without constitutional inhibition, to be constrained\r\nby the public conscience and the just aversion to any semblance of\r\nbargain and sale, or bribery, in the public service.\r\n\r\nThe case of our President is exceptional. Notoriously he has taken\r\ngifts while in the public service, some at least after he had been\r\nelected President, until “the Galena tanner of a few hundred dollars\r\na year”--to borrow the words of my colleague [Mr. WILSON], one of\r\nhis supporters--is now rich in houses, lands, and stock, above his\r\nsalary, being probably the richest President since George Washington.\r\nNotoriously he has appointed to his Cabinet several among these “Greeks\r\nbearing gifts,” without seeming to see the indecorum, if not the\r\nindecency, of the transaction. At least two, if not three, of these\r\nGreeks, having no known position in the Republican Party, or influence\r\nin the country, have been selected as his counsellors in national\r\naffairs and heads of great departments of government. Again do I\r\nrepeat the words of our Scriptures, “A gift doth blind the eyes of the\r\nwise”; again the words of Washington, “Should I not thenceforward be\r\nconsidered as a dependant?”\r\n\r\nNor does the case of the first Secretary of State differ in character\r\nfrom that of the other three Cabinet officers referred to. The\r\nPresident, feeling under personal obligation to Mr. Washburne for\r\nimportant support, gave him a complimentary nomination, with the\r\nunderstanding that after confirmation he should forthwith resign. I\r\ncannot forget the indignant comment of the late Mr. Fessenden, as we\r\npassed out of the Senate Chamber immediately after the confirmation.\r\n“Who,” said he, “ever heard before of a man nominated Secretary of\r\nState merely as a compliment?” But this is only another case of the\r\npublic service subordinated to personal considerations.\r\n\r\nNot only in the Cabinet, but in other offices, there is reason to\r\nbelieve that the President has been under the influence of patrons. Why\r\nwas he so blind to Thomas Murphy? The custom-house of New York, with\r\nall its capacity as a political engine, was handed over to this agent,\r\nwhose want of recognition in the Republican Party was outbalanced by\r\nPresidential favor, and whose gifts have become notorious. And when the\r\ndemand for his removal was irresistible, the President accepted his\r\nresignation with an effusion of sentiment natural toward a patron, but\r\nwithout justification in the character of the retiring officer.\r\n\r\nShakespeare, who saw intuitively the springs of human conduct, touches\r\nmore than once on the operation of the gift. “I’ll do thee service for\r\nso good a gift,” said Gloster to Warwick.[112] Then, again, how truly\r\nspoke the lord, who said of Timon,--\r\n\r\n                    “No gift to him\r\n    But breeds the giver a return exceeding\r\n    All use of quittance.”[113]\r\n\r\nAnd such were the returns made by the President.\r\n\r\nThus much for gifts, reciprocated by office. The instance is original\r\nand without precedent in our history.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENCY A PERQUISITE.\r\n\r\nI have now completed the survey of the two typical instances--Nepotism,\r\nand Gift-Taking with repayment by office--in which we are compelled\r\nto see the President. In these things he shows himself. Here is no\r\nportrait drawn by critic or enemy; it is the original who stands\r\nforth, saying: “Behold the generosity I practise to my relations at\r\nthe expense of the public service! also the gifts I take, and then\r\nmy way of rewarding the patrons, always at the expense of the public\r\nservice!” In this open exhibition we see how the Presidency, instead\r\nof a trust, has become a perquisite. Bad as are these two capital\r\ninstances, and important as is their condemnation, so that they may not\r\nbecome a precedent, I dwell on them now as illustrating character. A\r\nPresident who can do such things, and not recognize at once the error\r\nhe has committed, shows that supereminence of egotism under which\r\nConstitution, International Law, and Municipal Law, to say nothing of\r\nRepublican Government in its primary principles, are all subordinated\r\nto the Presidential will; and this is Personal Government. Add an\r\ninsensibility to the honest convictions of others, and you have a\r\nnatural feature of this pretension.\r\n\r\nLawyers cite what are called “Leading Cases.” A few of these show the\r\nPresidential will in constant operation with little regard to precedent\r\nor reason, so as to be a caprice, if it were not a pretension.\r\nImitating the Popes in Nepotism, the President has imitated them in\r\nostentatious assumption of Infallibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT’S INAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\nOther Presidents have entered upon their high office with a\r\ncertain modesty and distrust. Washington in his Inaugural Address\r\ndeclared his “anxieties,” also his sense of “the magnitude and\r\ndifficulty of the trust,” “awakening a distrustful scrutiny into his\r\nqualifications.”[114] Jefferson, in his famous Inaugural, so replete\r\nwith political wisdom, after declaring his “sincere consciousness that\r\nthe task is above his talents,” says: “I approach it with those anxious\r\nand awful presentiments which the greatness of the charge and the\r\nweakness of my powers so justly inspire, … and humble myself before the\r\nmagnitude of the undertaking.”[115]\r\n\r\nOur soldier, absolutely untried in civil life, entirely a new man,\r\nentering upon the sublimest duties, before which Washington and\r\nJefferson had shrunk, said in his Inaugural: “The responsibilities\r\nof the position I feel, but _accept them without fear_.”[116] Great\r\npredecessors, with ample preparation for the responsibilities,\r\nhad shrunk back with fear. He had none. Either he did not see the\r\nresponsibilities, or the Cæsar began to stir in his bosom.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF HIS CABINET.\r\n\r\nNext after the Inaugural Address, his first official act was the\r\nselection of his Cabinet; and here the general disappointment was\r\nequalled by the general wonder. As the President was little known\r\nexcept from the victories which had commended him, it was not then\r\nseen how completely characteristic was this initial act. Looking back\r\nupon it, we recognize the pretension by which all tradition, usage,\r\nand propriety were discarded, by which the just expectations of the\r\nparty that had elected him were set at nought, and the safeguards of\r\nconstitutional government were subordinated to the personal pretensions\r\nof One Man. In this Cabinet were persons having small relations\r\nwith the Republican Party and little position in the country, some\r\nabsolutely without claims from public service, and some actually\r\ndisqualified by the gifts they had made to the President. Such was\r\nthe political phenomenon presented for the first time in American\r\nhistory, while reported sayings of the President showed the simplicity\r\nwith which he acted. To a committee he described his Cabinet as his\r\n“family,” with which no stranger could be allowed to interfere, and\r\nto a member of Congress he announced that he selected his Cabinet “to\r\nplease himself and nobody else,”--being good rules unquestionably\r\nfor the organization of a household and the choice of domestics, to\r\nwhich the Cabinet seem to have been likened. This personal government\r\nflowered in the Navy Department, where a gift-bearing Greek was\r\nsuddenly changed to a Secretary. No less a personage than the grand\r\nold Admiral, the brave, yet modest Farragut, was reported as asking,\r\non the fifth of March, the very day when the Cabinet was announced,\r\nin unaffected ignorance, “Do you know anything of Borie?” And yet\r\nthis unconspicuous citizen, bearer of gifts to the President, was\r\nconstituted the naval superior of that historic character. If others\r\nwere less obscure, the Cabinet as a unit was none the less notable as\r\nthe creature of Presidential will, where Chance vied with Favoritism as\r\narbiter.\r\n\r\nAll this is so strange, when we consider the true idea of a Cabinet.\r\nThough not named in the Constitution, yet by virtue of unbroken usage\r\namong us, and in harmony with constitutional governments everywhere,\r\nthe Cabinet has become a constitutional body, hardly less than if\r\nexpressly established by the Constitution itself. Its members, besides\r\nbeing the heads of great departments, are the counsellors of the\r\nPresident, with the duty to advise him of all matters within the sphere\r\nof his office, being nothing less than the great catalogue in the\r\nPreamble of the Constitution, beginning with duty to the Union, and\r\nending with the duty to secure the blessings of Liberty to ourselves\r\nand our posterity. Besides undoubted fitness for these exalted\r\nresponsibilities, as head of a department and as counsellor, a member\r\nshould have such acknowledged position in the country that his presence\r\ninspires confidence and gives strength to the Administration. How\r\nlittle these things were regarded by the President need not be said.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably the President has a discretion in the appointment of\r\nhis Cabinet; but it is a constitutional discretion, regulated by\r\nregard for the interests of the country and not by mere personal\r\nwill, by statesmanship and not by favoritism. A Cabinet is a national\r\ninstitution and not a Presidential perquisite,--unless our President is\r\nallowed to copy the example of Imperial France. In all constitutional\r\ngovernments, the Cabinet is selected on public reasons, and with a\r\nsingle eye to the public service; it is not in any respect the “family”\r\nof the sovereign, nor is it “to please himself and nobody else.”\r\nEnglish monarchs have often accepted statesmen personally disagreeable,\r\nwhen they had become representatives of the prevailing party,--as\r\nwhen George the Third, the most obstinate of rulers, accepted Fox,\r\nand George the Fourth, as prejudiced as his father was obstinate,\r\naccepted Canning, each bringing to the service commanding faculties.\r\nIt is related that the Duke of Wellington, with military frankness,\r\nencountered the personal objections of the King in the latter case,\r\nby saying: “Your Majesty is the sovereign of England, with duties to\r\nyour people far above any to yourself; and these duties render it\r\nimperative that you should at this time employ the abilities of Mr.\r\nCanning.”[117] By such instances in a constitutional government is the\r\nCabinet fixed as a constitutional and not a personal body. It is only\r\nby some extraordinary hallucination that the President of a Republic\r\ndedicated to Constitutional Liberty can imagine himself invested with\r\na transforming prerogative above that of any English sovereign, by\r\nwhich his counsellors are changed from public officers to personal\r\nattendants, and a great constitutional body, in which all citizens have\r\na common interest, is made a perquisite of the President.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPROPRIATION OF THE OFFICES.\r\n\r\nMarked among the spectacles which followed, and kindred in character\r\nwith the appropriation of the Cabinet as individual property, was\r\nthe appropriation of the offices of the country, to which I refer in\r\nthis place even at the expense of repetition. Obscure and undeserving\r\nrelations, marriage connections, personal retainers, army associates,\r\nfriends of unknown fame and notable only as personal friends or friends\r\nof his relations, evidently absorbed the Presidential mind during\r\nthose months of obdurate reticence when a generous people supposed\r\nthe Cabinet to be the all-absorbing thought. Judging by the facts, it\r\nwould seem as if the chief and most spontaneous thought was how to\r\nexploit the appointing power to his own personal behoof. At this period\r\nthe New York Custom-House presented itself to the imagination, and a\r\nletter was written consigning a military dependant to the generosity of\r\nthe Collector. You know the rest. Dr. Johnson, acting as executor in\r\nselling the distillery of Mr. Thrale, said: “We are not here to sell a\r\nparcel of boilers and vats, but the potentiality of growing rich beyond\r\nthe dreams of avarice.”[118] If the President did not use the sounding\r\nphrase of the great English moralist, it is evident that his military\r\ndependant felt in that letter all the “potentiality” advertised in the\r\nearlier case, and acted accordingly.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to say that in these things there was departure\r\nfrom the requirements of law, whether in the appointment of his Cabinet\r\nor of personal favorites, even in return for personal benefactions,\r\nalthough it was plainly unrepublican, offensive, and indefensible. But\r\nthis same usurping spirit, born of an untutored egotism, brooking no\r\nrestraint, showed itself in another class of transactions, to which I\r\nhave already referred, where Law and Constitution were little regarded.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL ASSAULT ON A SAFEGUARD OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nFirst in time and very indigenous in character was the Presidential\r\nattempt against one of the sacred safeguards of the Treasury, the\r\noriginal workmanship of Alexander Hamilton, being nothing less than\r\nthe “Act to establish the Treasury Department.” Here was an important\r\nprovision, “that no person appointed to any office instituted by this\r\nAct shall directly or indirectly be concerned or interested in carrying\r\non the business of trade or commerce”; and any person so offending was\r\ndeclared guilty of a high misdemeanor, and was to forfeit to the United\r\nStates three thousand dollars, with removal from office, and forever\r\nthereafter to be incapable of holding any office under the United\r\nStates.[119] From the beginning this statute had stood unquestioned,\r\nuntil it had acquired the character of fundamental law. And yet the\r\nPresident, by a special message, dated March 6, 1869, being the\r\nsecond day of his first service as a civilian, asked Congress to set\r\nit aside, so as to enable Mr. Stewart, of New York already nominated\r\nand confirmed as Secretary of the Treasury, to enter upon the duties\r\nof this office.[120] This gentleman was unquestionably the largest\r\nmerchant who had transacted business in our country, and his imports\r\nwere of such magnitude as to clog the custom-house. If the statute was\r\nanything but one of those cobwebs which catch the weak, but yield to\r\nthe rich, this was the occasion for it, and the President should have\r\nyielded to no temptation against it. The indecorum of his effort stands\r\nout more painfully when it is considered that the merchant for whom he\r\nwished to set aside a time-honored safeguard was one of those from whom\r\nhe had received gifts.\r\n\r\nSuch was the accommodating disposition of the Senate, that a bill\r\nexempting the Presidential benefactor from the operation of the statute\r\nwas promptly introduced, and even read twice, until, as it seemed\r\nabout to pass, I felt it my duty to object to its consideration,\r\nsaying, according to the Globe, “I think it ought to be most profoundly\r\nconsidered before it is acted on by the Senate.”[121] This objection\r\ncaused its postponement. The country was startled. By telegraph the\r\ngeneral anxiety was communicated to Washington. Three days later the\r\nPresident sent a message requesting permission to withdraw the former\r\nmessage.[122] But he could not withdraw the impression produced by such\r\nopen disregard of the law to promote his personal desire.\r\n\r\n\r\nILLEGAL MILITARY RING AT THE EXECUTIVE MANSION.\r\n\r\nThe military spirit, which failed in the effort to set aside a\r\nfundamental law as if it were a transient order, was more successful at\r\nthe Executive Mansion, which at once assumed the character of military\r\nhead-quarters. To the dishonor of the civil service, and in total\r\ndisregard of precedent, the President surrounded himself with officers\r\nof the Army, and substituted military forms for those of civil life,\r\ndetailing for this service members of his late staff. The earliest\r\npublic notice of this military occupation appeared in the “Daily\r\nMorning Chronicle” of March 8, 1869, understood to be the official\r\norgan of the Administration:--\r\n\r\n    “President Grant was not at the White House yesterday, but the\r\n    following members of his staff were occupying the Secretaries’\r\n    rooms and acting as such: Generals Babcock, Porter, Badeau, and\r\n    Dent.”\r\n\r\nThis is to be regarded not only in its strange blazonry of the\r\nPresidential pretension, but also as the first apparition of that minor\r\n_military ring_ in which the President has lived ever since.\r\n\r\nThus installed, Army officers became secretaries of the President,\r\ndelivering his messages to both Houses of Congress, and even\r\nauthenticating Presidential acts as if they were military orders. Here,\r\nfor instance, is an official communication:--\r\n\r\n                                  EXECUTIVE MANSION, Washington, D. C.,\r\n                                                        March 15, 1869.\r\n\r\n    ROBERT MARTIN DOUGLAS, Esq.:\r\n\r\n    SIR,--You are hereby appointed Assistant Private Secretary to the\r\n    President, to date from the 15th March, 1869.\r\n\r\n        By order of the President,\r\n\r\n            HORACE PORTER,\r\n            _Brevet Brigadier-General, Secretary_.[123]\r\n\r\nMark the words, “By order of the President,” and then the signature,\r\n“Horace Porter, Brevet Brigadier-General, Secretary.”\r\n\r\nThe Presidential pretension which I exhibit on the simple facts,\r\nbesides being of doubtful legality, to say the least, was of evil\r\nexample, demoralizing alike to the military and civil service, and\r\nan undoubted reproach to republican institutions in that primary\r\nprinciple, announced by Jefferson in his first Inaugural Address,\r\n“the supremacy of the civil over the military authority.”[124] It\r\nseemed only to remain that the President should sign his Messages,\r\n“Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the United States.” Evidently a new\r\norder of things had arrived.\r\n\r\nObserve the mildness of my language, when I call this Presidential\r\npretension “of doubtful legality.” The law shall speak for itself.\r\nObviously it was the same for our military President as for his\r\npredecessors, and it was recent also:--\r\n\r\n    “The President is hereby authorized to appoint a private secretary\r\n    at an annual salary of $3,500, an assistant secretary at an annual\r\n    salary of $2,500, a short-hand writer at an annual salary of\r\n    $2,500, a clerk of pardons at an annual salary of $2,000, and three\r\n    clerks of the fourth class.”[125]\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted that this provision was more than ample; for\r\nCongress, by Act of July 20, 1868, repealed so much as authorized\r\na clerk of pardons, and also one of the three clerks of the fourth\r\nclass.[126] Therefore there could be no necessity for a levy of\r\nsoldiers to perform the duties of secretaries, and the conduct of the\r\nPresident can be explained only by the supposition that he preferred\r\nto be surrounded by Army officers rather than by civilians, continuing\r\nin the Executive Mansion the traditions of head-quarters: all which,\r\nthough agreeable to him and illustrating his character, was an anomaly\r\nand a scandal.\r\n\r\nIn extenuation of this indefensible pretension, we have been reminded\r\nof two things: first, that according to the record Washington sent\r\nhis first message by General Knox,--when in fact General Knox held\r\nno military office at that time, but was actually Secretary of War;\r\nand, secondly, that the military officers now occupying the Executive\r\nMansion are detailed for this service without other salary than that of\r\ntheir grade. As the Knox precedent is moonshine, the minor military\r\nring can be vindicated only as a “detail” for service in the Executive\r\nMansion.\r\n\r\nHere again the law shall speak. By Act of Congress of March 3, 1863, it\r\nis provided that “details to special service shall only be made with\r\nthe consent of the commanding officer of forces in the field”;[127] but\r\nthis, it will be seen, refers to a state of war. Congress, by Act of\r\nJuly 16, 1866, authorized the President to “detail from the Army all\r\nthe officers and agents of this Bureau” [for the Relief of Freedmen and\r\nRefugees];[128] also, by Act of July 28, 1866, to “detail” officers\r\nof the Army, not exceeding twenty at any time, “to act as president,\r\nsuperintendent, or professor” in certain colleges.[129] And then\r\nagain, by Act of July 15, 1870, it provided that “any retired officer\r\nmay, on his own application, be detailed to serve as professor in any\r\ncollege.”[130] As there is no other statute authorizing details, this\r\nexceptional transfer of Army officers to the Executive Mansion can be\r\nmaintained only on some undefined prerogative.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential pretension, which is continued to the present time,\r\nis the more unnatural when it is considered that there are at least\r\nthree different statutes in which Congress has shown its purpose to\r\nlimit the employment of military officers in civil service. As long\r\nago as July 5, 1838, it was positively provided that no Army officers\r\nshould be separated from their regiments and corps “for employment on\r\ncivil works of internal improvement, or be allowed to engage in the\r\nservice of incorporated companies”; nor any line officer to be acting\r\npaymaster or disbursing agent for the Indian Department, “if such\r\nextra employment require that he be separated from his regiment or\r\ncompany, or otherwise interfere with the performance of the military\r\nduties proper.”[131] Obviously the will of Congress is here declared,\r\nthat officers should not be allowed to leave their posts for any\r\nservice which might _interfere with the performance of the military\r\nduties proper_. This language is explicit. Then came the Act of March\r\n30, 1868, which provides that “any officer of the Army or Navy of\r\nthe United States, who shall, after the passage of this Act, accept\r\nor hold any appointment in the diplomatic or consular service of the\r\nGovernment, shall be considered as having resigned his said office,\r\nand the place held by him in the military or naval service shall be\r\ndeemed and taken to be vacant.”[132] To a considerate and circumspect\r\nPresident, who recognized the law in its spirit as well as its letter,\r\nthis provision, especially when reinforced by the earlier statute,\r\nwould have been a rule of action in analogous cases, and therefore an\r\ninsurmountable obstacle to a pretension which takes Army officers from\r\ntheir proper duties and makes them Presidential secretaries. A later\r\nstatute adds to the obstacle. By Act of Congress of July 15, 1870, it\r\nis provided:--\r\n\r\n    “That it shall not be lawful for any officer of the Army of the\r\n    United States on the active list _to hold any civil office, whether\r\n    by election or appointment_; and any such officer _accepting or\r\n    exercising the functions of a civil office_ shall at once cease\r\n    to be an officer of the Army, and his commission shall be vacated\r\n    thereby.”[133]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to imagine anything plainer than these words. No\r\nArmy officer not on the retired list can hold any civil office; and\r\nthen, to enforce the inhibition, it is provided that in “accepting or\r\nexercising the functions” of such office the commission is vacated.\r\nNow the Blue Book, which is our political almanac, has under the head\r\nof “Executive Mansion” a list of “secretaries” and “clerks,” beginning\r\nas follows: “Secretaries, General F. T. Dent, General Horace Porter,\r\nGeneral O. E. Babcock,” when, in fact, there are no such officers\r\nauthorized by law. Then follow the “Private Secretary,” “Assistant\r\nPrivate Secretary,” and “Executive Clerks,” authorized by law, but\r\nplaced below those unauthorized. Nothing is said of being detailed for\r\nthis purpose. They are openly called “Secretaries,” which is a title of\r\noffice; and since it is at the Executive Mansion, it must be a civil\r\noffice; and yet, in defiance of law, these Army officers continue\r\nto exercise its functions, and some of them enter the Senate with\r\nmessages from the President. The apology that they are “detailed” for\r\nthis service is vain; no authority can be shown for it. But how absurd\r\nto suppose that a rule against the exercise of a civil office can be\r\nevaded by a “detail”! If it may be done for three Army officers, why\r\nnot for three dozen? Nay, more, if the civil office of Secretary at\r\nthe Executive Mansion may be created without law, why not some other\r\ncivil office? And what is to hinder the President from surrounding\r\nhimself not only with secretaries, but with messengers, stewards, and\r\npersonal attendants, even a body-guard, all detailed from the Army?\r\nWhy may he not enlarge the military circle at the Executive Mansion\r\nindefinitely? If the President can be justified in his present course,\r\nthere is no limit to his pretensions in open violation of the statute.\r\nHere the Blue Book testifies again; for it records the names of the\r\n“secretaries” in their proper places as Army officers,--thus presenting\r\nthem as holding two incompatible offices.\r\n\r\nI dismiss this transaction as another instance of Presidential\r\npretension, which, in the interest of Republican Government, should be\r\narrested.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNREPUBLICAN SUBORDINATION OF THE WAR DEPARTMENT TO THE\r\nGENERAL-IN-CHIEF.\r\n\r\nFrom the Executive Mansion pass now to the War Department, and there\r\nwe witness the same Presidential pretensions by which law, usage, and\r\ncorrect principle are lost in the will of One Man. The supremacy of the\r\ncivil power over the military is typified in the Secretary of War, a\r\ncivilian, from whom Army officers receive orders. But this beautiful\r\nrule, with its lesson to the military of subordination, was suddenly\r\nset aside by our President, and the Secretary of War degraded to be\r\na clerk. The 5th of March witnessed a most important order from the\r\nPresident, placing the Military Departments under officers of his\r\nchoice,--purporting to be signed by the Assistant Adjutant-General by\r\ncommand of the General of the Army, but actually ignoring the Secretary\r\nof War.[134] Three days later, March 8th, witnessed another order\r\nprofessing to proceed from the President, whereby in express terms the\r\nWar Department was subordinated to the General-in-Chief, being William\r\nT. Sherman, who at the time was promoted to that command. Here are the\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n    “The chiefs of staff corps, departments, and bureaus will report to\r\n    and act under the immediate orders of the General commanding the\r\n    Army.”[135]\r\n\r\nThis act of revolution, exalting the military power above the civil,\r\nshowed instant fruits in an order of the General, who, upon assuming\r\ncommand, proceeded to place the several bureau officers of the War\r\nDepartment upon his military staff,[136] so that for the time there\r\nwas a military dictatorship with the President at its head, not merely\r\nin spirit but in actual form. By-and-by John A. Rawlins, a civilian by\r\neducation and a respecter of the Constitution, became Secretary of War,\r\nand, though bound to the President by personal ties, he said, “Check\r\nto the King.” By General Order, issued from the War Department March\r\n26, 1869, and signed by the Secretary of War, the offensive order was\r\nrescinded, and it was enjoined that “all official business which by\r\nlaw or regulations requires the action of the President or Secretary\r\nof War will be submitted by the chiefs of staff corps, departments,\r\nand bureaus to the Secretary of War.”[137] Public report said that\r\nthis restoration of the civil power to its rightful supremacy was\r\nnot obtained without an intimation of resignation on the part of the\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY BY DEPUTY.\r\n\r\nKindred in character was the unprecedented attempt to devolve the\r\nduties of the Navy Department upon a deputy, so that orders were to be\r\nsigned “A. E. Borie, Secretary of the Navy, per D. D. Porter, Admiral,”\r\nas appears in the official journal of May 11, 1869,--or, according to\r\nanother instance, “David D. Porter, Vice-Admiral, for the Secretary\r\nof the Navy.” The obvious object of this illegal arrangement was to\r\nenable the incumbent, who stood high on the list of gift-makers,\r\nto be Secretary without being troubled with the business of the\r\noffice. Notoriously he was an invalid, unused to public business,\r\nwho, according to his own confession, modestly pleaded that he could\r\nnot apply himself to work more than an hour a day; but the President\r\nsoothed his anxieties by promising a deputy who would do the work. And\r\nthus was this great department made a plaything; but public opinion\r\nand other counsels arrested the sport. Here I mention, that, when this\r\nincumbent left his important post, it is understood that he was allowed\r\nto nominate his successor.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL PRETENSION AT THE INDIAN BUREAU.\r\n\r\nAt the same time occurred the effort to absorb the Indian Bureau\r\ninto the War Department, changing its character as part of the civil\r\nservice. Congress had already repudiated such an attempt;[138] but\r\nthe President, not disheartened by legislative failure, sought to\r\naccomplish it by manipulation and indirection. First elevating a\r\nmember of his late staff to the head of the Bureau, he then, by\r\na military order dated May 7, 1869,[139] proceeded to detail for\r\nthe Indian service a long list of “officers left out of their\r\nregimental organizations by the consolidation of the infantry\r\nregiments,”--assuming to do this by authority of the Act of Congress\r\nof June 30, 1834, which, after declaring the number of Indian agents,\r\nand how they shall be appointed, provides that “it shall be competent\r\nfor the President to require any military officer of the United States\r\nto execute the duties of Indian agent.”[140] Obviously this provision\r\nhad reference to some exceptional exigency, and can be no authority for\r\nthe general substitution of military officers, instead of civilians\r\nconfirmed by the Senate and bound with sureties for the faithful\r\ndischarge of their duties. And yet upward of sixty Army officers were\r\nin this way foisted into the Indian service. The Act of Congress of\r\nJuly 15, 1870, already quoted,[141] creating an incompatibility between\r\nmilitary and civil service, was aimed partly at this abuse, and these\r\nofficers ceased to be Indian agents. But this attempt is another\r\nillustration of Presidential pretension.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY INTERFERENCE AT ELECTIONS.\r\n\r\nThen followed military interference in elections, and the repeated\r\nuse of the military in aid of the revenue law under circumstances of\r\ndoubtful legality, until at last General Halleck and General Sherman\r\nprotested: the former in his report of October 24, 1870, saying, “I\r\nrespectfully repeat the recommendation of my last Annual Report, that\r\nmilitary officers should not interfere in local civil difficulties,\r\nunless called out in the manner provided by law;”[142] and the latter,\r\nin his Report of November 10, 1870, “I think the soldiers ought\r\nnot to be expected to make individual arrests, or to do any act of\r\nviolence, except in their organized capacity as a _posse comitatus_\r\nduly summoned by the United States marshal, and acting in his personal\r\npresence.”[143] And so this military pretension, invading civil\r\naffairs, was arrested.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL PRETENSION AGAIN.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile this same Presidential usurpation, subordinating all to\r\nhimself, became palpable in another form. It was said of Gustavus\r\nAdolphus, that he drilled his Diet to vote at the word of command.\r\nSuch at the outset seemed to be the Presidential policy with regard\r\nto Congress. We were to vote as he desired. He did not like the\r\nTenure-of-Office Act, and during the first month of his administration\r\nhis influence was felt in both branches of Congress to secure its\r\nrepeal; all of which seemed more astonishing when it was considered\r\nthat he entered upon his high trust with the ostentatious avowal that\r\nall laws would be faithfully executed, whether they met his approval or\r\nnot, and that he should have no policy to enforce against the will of\r\nthe people.[144] That beneficent statute, which he had upheld in the\r\nimpeachment of President Johnson, was a limitation on the Presidential\r\npower of appointment, and he could not brook it. Here was plain\r\ninterference with his great perquisite of office, and Congress must be\r\ncoerced to repeal it. The House acted promptly and passed the desired\r\nbill. In the Senate there was delay and a protracted debate, during\r\nwhich the official journal announced: “The President, in conversation\r\nwith a prominent Senator a few days since, declared that it was his\r\nintention not to send in any nominations of importance until definite\r\naction was taken by Congress upon the Tenure-of-Office Bill.”[145]\r\n\r\nHere I venture to add, that a member of the Cabinet pressed me to\r\nwithdraw my opposition to the repeal, saying that the President felt\r\nstrongly upon it. I could not understand how a Republican President\r\ncould consent to weaken the limitations upon the Executive, and so I\r\nsaid,--adding, that in my judgment he should rather reach forth his\r\nhands and ask to have them tied. Better always a government of law than\r\nof men.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL INTERFERENCE IN LOCAL POLITICS.\r\n\r\nIn this tyrannical spirit, and in the assumption of his central\r\nimperialism, he has interfered with political questions and party\r\nmovements in distant States, reaching into Missouri, and then into\r\nNew York, to dictate how the people should vote, then manipulating\r\nLouisiana through a brother-in-law appointed Collector. With him a\r\ncustom-house seems less a place for the collection of revenue than an\r\nengine of political influence, through which his dictatorship may be\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nAuthentic testimony places this tyrannical abuse beyond question. New\r\nYork is the scene, and Thomas Murphy, Collector, the Presidential\r\nlieutenant. Nobody doubts the intimacy between the President and\r\nthe Collector, who are bound in friendship by other ties than those\r\nof seaside neighborhood. The Collector was determined to obtain the\r\ncontrol of the Republican State Convention, and appealed to a patriot\r\ncitizen for help, who replied, that in his judgment “it would be a\r\ndelicate matter for office-holders to undertake to dictate to the\r\nassociations in the different districts who should go from them to\r\nthe State Convention, and still more delicate to attempt to control\r\nthe judgments of men employed in the different departments as to the\r\nbest men to represent them.” The brave Collector lieutenant of the\r\nPresident said, “that he should not hesitate to do it; that it was\r\nGeneral Grant’s wish, and General Grant was the head of the Republican\r\nParty, and should be authority on this subject.”[146] Plainly, the\r\nRepublican Party was his perquisite, and all Republicans were to do\r\nhis bidding. From other testimony it appears that the President,\r\naccording to the statement of his lieutenant, “wanted to be represented\r\nin the Convention,” being the Republican State Convention of New\r\nYork,--“wanted to have his friends there in the Convention”; and the\r\nPresidential lieutenant, being none other than the famous Collector,\r\noffered to appoint four men in the custom-house for the witness, if he\r\nwould secure the nomination of certain persons as delegates from his\r\ndistrict, and he promised “that he would immediately send their names\r\non to Washington and have them appointed.”[147] And so the Presidential\r\ndictatorship was administered. Offices in the custom-house were openly\r\nbartered for votes in the State Convention. Here was intolerable\r\ntyranny, with demoralization like that of the slave-market.\r\n\r\nBut New York is not the only scene of this outrage. The Presidential\r\npretension extends everywhere; nor is it easy to measure the arrogance\r\nof corruption or the honest indignation it quickens into life.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL CONTRIVANCE AGAINST SAN DOMINGO.\r\n\r\nThese Presidential pretensions, in all their variety, personal and\r\nmilitary, with reckless indifference to law, naturally ripened in the\r\ncontrivance, nursed in hot-house secrecy, against the peace of the\r\nisland of San Domingo: I say deliberately, against the peace of that\r\nisland, for under the guise of annexing a portion there was menace\r\nto the Black Republic of Hayti. This whole business, absolutely\r\nindefensible from beginning to end, being wrong at every point, is the\r\nspecial and most characteristic product of the Administration, into\r\nwhich it infused and projected itself more than into anything else.\r\nIn this multiform disobedience we behold our President. Already I\r\nhave referred to this contrivance as marking an epoch in Presidential\r\npretensions. It is my duty now to show its true character as a warning\r\nagainst its author.\r\n\r\nA few weeks only after beginning his career as a civilian, and while\r\noccupied with military usurpations and the perquisites of office, he\r\nwas tempted by overtures of Dominican plotters, headed by the usurper\r\nBaez and the speculator Cazneau: the first an adventurer, conspirator,\r\nand trickster, described by one who knows him well as “the worst man\r\nliving of whom he has any personal knowledge”;[148] and the second,\r\none of our own countrymen, long resident on the island, known as\r\ndisloyal throughout the war, and entirely kindred in character to Baez.\r\nListening to these prompters, and without one word in Congress or in\r\nthe press suggesting annexion of the island or any part of it, the\r\nPresident began his contrivance; and here we see abuse in every form\r\nand at every step, absolutely without precedent in our history.\r\n\r\nThe agent in this transaction was Orville E. Babcock, a young officer\r\nfiguring in the Blue Book of the time as one of the unauthorized\r\n“secretaries” at the Executive Mansion, and also as a major of\r\nengineers. His published instructions, under date of July 13, 1869,\r\nwere simply to make inquiries; but the plot appears in a communication\r\nof the same date from the Secretary of the Navy, directed to the\r\nSeminole, a war-ship, with an armament of one eleven-inch gun and four\r\nthirty-two pounders, “to give him the _moral support_ of its guns”; and\r\nthis was followed by a telegraphic instruction to Key West for another\r\nwar-ship “to proceed without a moment’s delay to San Domingo City, to\r\nbe placed at the disposal of General Babcock while on that coast.”[149]\r\nWith such “moral support” the emissary of the President obtained from\r\nthe usurper Baez that famous Protocol stipulating the annexion of\r\nDominica to the United States in consideration of $1,500,000, which the\r\nyoung officer, fresh from the Executive Mansion, professed to execute\r\nas “Aide-de-Camp to his Excellency General Ulysses S. Grant, President\r\nof the United States,”--as if, instead of Chief Magistrate of a\r\nRepublic, the President were a military chieftain with his foot in the\r\nstirrup, surrounded by a military staff. The same instrument contained\r\nthe unblushing stipulation, that “his Excellency General Grant,\r\nPresident of the United States, promises, _privately, to use all his\r\ninfluence_, in order that the idea of annexing the Dominican Republic\r\nto the United States may acquire such a degree of popularity among\r\nmembers of Congress as will be necessary for its accomplishment”:[150]\r\nwhich is simply that the President shall become a lobbyist to bring\r\nabout the annexion by Congress. Such was the strange beginning,\r\nillegal, unconstitutional, and offensive in every particular, but\r\nshowing the Presidential character.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Washington, the young officer, who had assumed to be\r\n“Aide-de-Camp to his Excellency General Ulysses S. Grant,” and had\r\nbound the President to become a lobbyist for a wretched scheme, instead\r\nof being disowned and reprimanded, was sent back to the usurper with\r\ninstructions to negotiate two treaties,--one for the annexion of the\r\nhalf-island of Dominica, and the other for the lease of the Bay of\r\nSamana.[151] By the Constitution of the United States “ambassadors and\r\nother public ministers” are appointed by the President by and with the\r\nadvice and consent of the Senate; but our Aide-de-Camp had no such\r\ncommission. Presidential prerogative empowered him. Nor was naval\r\nforce wanting. With three war-ships at his disposal,[152] he concluded\r\nnegotiations with Baez and obtained the two treaties. Naturally force\r\nwas needed to keep the usurper in power while he sold his country,\r\nand naturally such a transaction required a Presidential Aide-de-Camp\r\nunknown to Constitution or Law, rather than a civilian duly appointed\r\naccording to both.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF CONSTITUTIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW.\r\n\r\nOn other occasions it has been my solemn duty to expose the outrages\r\nwhich attended this hateful business, where at each step we are brought\r\nface to face with Presidential pretension: first, in the open seizure\r\nof the war powers of the Government, as if he were already Cæsar,\r\nforcibly intervening in Dominica and menacing war to Hayti, all of\r\nwhich is proved by the official reports of the State Department and\r\nNavy Department, being nothing less than war by kingly prerogative,\r\nin defiance of that distinctive principle of Republican Government,\r\nfirst embodied in our Constitution, which places the war powers under\r\nthe safeguard of the legislative branch, making any attempt by the\r\nPresident “to declare war” an undoubted usurpation. But our President,\r\nlike Gallio, cares for none of these things. The open violation of the\r\nConstitution was naturally followed by a barefaced disregard of that\r\nequality of nations which is the first principle of International Law,\r\nas the equality of men is the first principle of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence; and this sacred rule was set aside in order to insult and\r\nmenace Hayti, doing unto the Black Republic what we would not have that\r\nRepublic do unto us, nor what we would have done to any white power.\r\nTo these eminent and most painful Presidential pretensions, the first\r\nadverse to the Constitution and the second adverse to International\r\nLaw, add the imprisonment of an American citizen in Dominica by the\r\nPresidential confederate, Baez, for fear of his hostility to the\r\ntreaty, if he were allowed to reach New York,--all of which was\r\nknown to his subordinates, Babcock and Cazneau, and doubtless to\r\nhimself. What was the liberty of an American citizen compared with the\r\nPresidential prerogative? To one who had defied the Constitution, on\r\nwhich depends the liberty of all, and then defied International Law,\r\non which depends the peace of the world, a single citizen immured in a\r\ndistant dungeon was of small moment. But this is only an illustration.\r\nAdd now the lawless occupation of the Bay of Samana for many months\r\nafter the lapse of the treaty, keeping the national flag flying there,\r\nand assuming a territorial sovereignty which did not exist. Then add\r\nthe protracted support of Baez in his usurped power, to the extent of\r\nplacing the national flag at his disposal, and girdling the island with\r\nour ships of war, all at immense cost, and to the neglect of other\r\nservice where the Navy was needed.\r\n\r\nThis strange succession of acts, which, if established for a precedent,\r\nwould overturn Constitution and Law, was followed by another class of\r\nPresidential manifestations: first, an unseemly importunity of Senators\r\nduring the pendency of the treaty, visiting the Capitol as a lobbyist,\r\nand summoning them to his presence in squads, in obvious pursuance\r\nof the stipulation made by his Aide-de-Camp and never disowned by\r\nhim,--being intervention in the Senate, reinforced by all the influence\r\nof the appointing power, whether by reward or menace, all of which was\r\nas unconstitutional in character as that warlike intervention on the\r\nisland; and then, after debate in the Senate, when the treaty was lost\r\non solemn vote, we were called to witness his self-willed effrontery\r\nin prosecuting the fatal error, returning to the charge in his Annual\r\nMessage at the ensuing session, insisting upon his contrivance as\r\nnothing less than the means by which “our large debt abroad is\r\nultimately to be extinguished,” and gravely charging the Senate with\r\n“folly” in rejecting the treaty,--and yet, while making this astounding\r\ncharge against a coördinate branch of Government, and claiming such\r\nastounding profits, he blundered geographically in describing the\r\nprize.[153]\r\n\r\nAll this diversified performance, with its various eccentricity of\r\neffort, failed. The report of able commissioners transported to the\r\nisland in an expensive war-ship ended in nothing. The American people\r\nrose against the undertaking and insisted upon its abandonment. By a\r\nmessage charged with Parthian shafts the President at length announced\r\nthat he would proceed no further in this business.[154] His senatorial\r\npartisans, being a majority of the Chamber, after denouncing those\r\nwho had exposed the business, arrested the discussion. In obedience\r\nto irrepressible sentiments, and according to the logic of my life, I\r\nfelt it my duty to speak; but the President would not forgive me, and\r\nhis peculiar representatives found me disloyal to the party which I had\r\nserved so long and helped to found. Then was devotion to the President\r\nmade the shibboleth of party.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE WAS THE GRAND INQUEST OF THE NATION?\r\n\r\nSuch is a summary of the San Domingo business in its characteristic\r\nfeatures. But here are transgressions in every form,--open violation of\r\nthe Constitution in more than one essential requirement; open violation\r\nof International Law in more than one of its most beautiful principles;\r\nflagrant insult to the Black Republic, with menace of war; complicity\r\nwith the wrongful imprisonment of an American citizen; lawless\r\nassumption of territorial sovereignty in a foreign jurisdiction;\r\nemployment of the national navy to sustain a usurper,--being all acts\r\nof substance, maintained by an agent calling himself “Aide-de-Camp to\r\nUlysses S. Grant, President of the United States,” and stipulating\r\nthat his chief should play the lobbyist to help the contrivance\r\nthrough Congress, then urged by private appeals to Senators, and\r\nthe influence of the appointing power tyrannically employed by the\r\nPresidential lobbyist, and finally urged anew in an Annual Message,\r\nwhere undisguised insult to the Senate vies with absurdity in declaring\r\nprospective profits and with geographical ignorance. Such, in brief,\r\nis this multiform disobedience, where every particular is of such\r\naggravation as to merit the most solemn judgment. Why the grand inquest\r\nof the nation, which brought Andrew Johnson to the bar of the Senate,\r\nshould have slept on this conglomerate misdemeanor, every part of\r\nwhich was offensive beyond any technical offence charged against his\r\npredecessor, while it had a background of nepotism, gift-taking with\r\nofficial compensation, and various Presidential pretensions beyond all\r\nprecedent,--all this will be one of the riddles of American history,\r\nto be explained only by the extent to which the One-Man Power had\r\nsucceeded in subjugating the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIGNITY TO THE AFRICAN RACE.\r\n\r\nLet me confess, Sir, that, while at each stage I have felt this\r\ntyranny most keenly, and never doubted that it ought to be arrested\r\nby impeachment, my feelings have been most stirred by the outrage to\r\nHayti, which, besides being a wrong to the Black Republic, was an\r\ninsult to the colored race, not only abroad, but here at home. How a\r\nChief Magistrate with four millions of colored fellow-citizens could\r\nhave done this thing passes comprehension. Did he suppose it would not\r\nbe known? Did he imagine it could be hushed in official pigeonholes?\r\nOr was he insensible to the true character of his own conduct? The\r\nfacts are indisputable. For more than two generations Hayti had been\r\nindependent, entitled under International Law to equality among\r\nnations, and since Emancipation in our country commended to us as an\r\nexample of self-government, being the first in the history of the\r\nAfrican race and the promise of the future. And yet our President, in\r\nhis effort to secure that Naboth’s Vineyard on which he had set his\r\neyes, not content with maintaining the usurper Baez in power, occupying\r\nthe harbors of Dominica with war-ships, sent other war-ships, being\r\nnone other than our most powerful monitor, the Dictator, with the\r\nfrigate Severn as consort, and with yet other monitors in their train,\r\nto strike at the independence of the Black Republic, and to menace it\r\nwith war. Do I err in any way, am I not entirely right, when I say\r\nthat here was unpardonable outrage to the African race? As one who for\r\nyears has stood by the side of this much-oppressed people, sympathizing\r\nalways in their woes and struggling for them, I felt the blow which the\r\nPresident dealt, and it became the more intolerable from the heartless\r\nattempts to defend it. Alas, that our President should be willing to\r\nwield the giant strength of the Great Republic in trampling upon the\r\nrepresentative government of the African race! Alas, that he did not\r\nsee the infinite debt of friendship, kindness, and protection due to\r\nthat people, so that instead of monitors and war-ships, breathing\r\nviolence, he had sent a messenger of peace and good-will!\r\n\r\nThis outrage was followed by an incident in which the same sentiments\r\nwere revealed. Frederick Douglass, remarkable for his intelligence as\r\nfor his eloquence, and always agreeable in personal relations, whose\r\nonly offence is a skin not entirely Caucasian, was selected by the\r\nPresident to accompany the Commissioners to San Domingo,--and yet on\r\nhis return, and almost within sight of the Executive Mansion, he was\r\nrepelled from the common table of the mail-steamer on the Potomac,\r\nwhere his companions were already seated; and thus through him was the\r\nAfrican race insulted and their equal rights denied. But the President,\r\nwhose commission he had borne, neither did nor said anything to right\r\nthis wrong, and a few days later, when entertaining the Commissioners\r\nat the Executive Mansion, actually forgot the colored orator whose\r\nservices he had sought.[155] But this indignity is in unison with the\r\nrest. After insulting the Black Republic, it is easy to see how natural\r\nit was to treat with insensibility the representative of the African\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n\r\nALL THESE THINGS IN ISSUE NOW.\r\n\r\nHere I stay this painful catalogue in its various heads, beginning\r\nwith nepotism and gift-taking with repayment by office, and ending\r\nin the contrivance against San Domingo with indignity to the African\r\nrace,--not because it is complete, but because it is enough. With\r\nsorrow unspeakable have I made this exposure of pretensions, which,\r\nfor the sake of republican institutions, every good citizen should\r\nwish expunged from history; but I had no alternative. The President\r\nhimself insists upon putting them in issue; he will not allow them\r\nto be forgotten. As a candidate for reëlection he invites judgment,\r\nwhile partisans acting in his behalf make it absolutely necessary by\r\nthe brutality of their assault on faithful Republicans unwilling to\r\nsee their party, like the Presidential office, a personal perquisite.\r\nIf his partisans are exacting, vindictive, and unjust, they act only\r\nin harmony with his nature, too truly represented in them. There is\r\nnot a ring, whether military or senatorial, that does not derive its\r\ndistinctive character from himself. Therefore, what they do and what\r\nthey say must be considered as done and said by the chieftain they\r\nserve. And here is a new manifestation of that sovereign egotism which\r\nno taciturnity can cover up, and a new motive for inquiry into its\r\npernicious influence.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT PRESIDENTIAL QUARRELLER.\r\n\r\nAny presentment of the President would be imperfect which did not show\r\nhow this ungovernable personality breaks forth in quarrel, making him\r\nthe great Presidential quarreller of our history. As in nepotism,\r\ngift-taking with repayment by office, and Presidential pretensions\r\ngenerally, here again he is foremost, having quarrelled not only more\r\nthan any other President, but more than all others together, from\r\nGeorge Washington to himself. His own Cabinet, the Senate, the House\r\nof Representatives, the diplomatic service, and the civil service\r\ngenerally, all have their victims, nearly every one of whom, besides\r\nserving the Republican Party, had helped to make him President.\r\nNor have Army officers, his companions in the field, or even his\r\ngenerous patrons, been exempt. To him a quarrel is not only a constant\r\nnecessity, but a perquisite of office. To nurse a quarrel, like tending\r\na horse, is in his list of Presidential duties. How idle must he be,\r\nshould the words of Shakespeare be fulfilled, “This day all quarrels\r\ndie”![156] To him may be applied those other words of Shakespeare, “As\r\nquarrellous as the weasel.”[157]\r\n\r\nEvidently our President has never read the Eleventh Commandment: “A\r\nPresident of the United States shall never quarrel.” At least he lives\r\nin perpetual violation of it, listening to stories from horse-cars,\r\ngobbling the gossip of his military ring, discoursing on imaginary\r\ngriefs, and nursing an unjust anger. The elect of forty millions of\r\npeople has no right to quarrel with anybody. His position is too\r\nexalted. He cannot do it without offence to the requirements of\r\npatriotism, without a shock to the decencies of life, without a jar to\r\nthe harmony of the universe. If lesson were needed for his conduct,\r\nhe might find it in that king of France who on ascending the throne\r\nmade haste to declare that he did not remember injuries received as\r\nDauphin.[158] Perhaps a better model still would be Tancred, the\r\nacknowledged type of the perfect Christian knight, who “disdained\r\nto speak ill of whoever it might be, even when ill had been spoken\r\nof himself.”[159] Our soldier President could not err in following\r\nthis knightly example. If this were too much, then at least might we\r\nhope that he would consent to limit the sphere of his quarrelsome\r\noperations so that the public service might not be disturbed. Of this\r\nbe assured,--in every quarrel he is the offender, according to the\r\nfact, as according to every reasonable presumption; especially is he\r\nresponsible for its continuance. The President can always choose his\r\nrelations with any citizen. But he chooses discord. With the arrogance\r\nof arms he resents any impediment in his path,--as when, in the spring\r\nof 1870, without allusion to himself, I felt it my duty to oppose his\r\nSan Domingo contrivance. The verse of Juvenal, as translated by Dryden,\r\ndescribes his conduct:--\r\n\r\n    “Poor me he fights,--if that be fighting where\r\n    He only cudgels and I only bear.\r\n    …\r\n    Answer or answer not, ’tis all the same,\r\n    He lays me on and makes me bear the blame.”[160]\r\n\r\nAnother scholarly translator gives to this description of the\r\nPresidential quarrel another form, which is also applicable:--\r\n\r\n    “If that be deemed a quarrel, where, Heaven knows,\r\n    He only gives and I receive the blows;\r\n    Across my path he strides and bids me Stand!--\r\n    I bow obsequious to the dread command.”[161]\r\n\r\nIf the latter verse is not entirely true in my case, something must be\r\npardoned to that Liberty in which I was born.\r\n\r\nMen take their places in history according to their deeds. The flattery\r\nof life is then superseded by the truthful record, and rulers do not\r\nescape judgment. Louis the Tenth of France has the designation of _Le\r\nHutin_, or “The Quarreller,” by which he is known in the long line of\r\nFrench kings. And so in the long line of American Chief-Magistrates\r\nhas our President vindicated for himself the same title. He must wear\r\nit. The French monarch was younger than our President; but there are\r\nother points in his life which are not without parallel. According\r\nto a contemporary chronicle, he was “well disposed, but not very\r\nattentive to the needs of the kingdom”;[162] and then again it was his\r\nrare fortune to sign one of the greatest ordinances of French history,\r\ndeclaring that “according to the Law of Nature every one must be\r\nborn free”;[163] but the Quarreller was in no respect author of this\r\nillustrious act, and was moved to its adoption by considerations of\r\npersonal advantage. It will be for impartial History to determine if\r\nour Quarreller, who treated his great office as a personal perquisite,\r\nand all his life long was against that Enfranchisement to which he put\r\nhis name, does not fall into the same category.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\r\n\r\nAnd now the question of Duty is distinctly presented to the Republican\r\nParty. I like that word. It is at the mandate of Duty that we must\r\nact. Do the Presidential pretensions merit the sanction of the party?\r\nCan Republicans, without departing from all obligations, whether\r\nof party or patriotism, recognize our ambitious Cæsar as a proper\r\nrepresentative? Can we take the fearful responsibility of his prolonged\r\nempire? I put these questions solemnly, as a member of the Republican\r\nParty, with all the earnestness of a life devoted to the triumph of\r\nthis party, but which I served always with the conviction that I\r\ngave up nothing that was meant for country or mankind. With me, the\r\nparty was country and mankind; but with the adoption of all these\r\nPresidential pretensions the party loses its distinctive character and\r\ndrops from its sphere. Its creed ceases to be Republicanism and becomes\r\nGrantism; its members cease to be Republicans and become Grant-men. It\r\nis no longer a _political_ party, but a _personal_ party. For myself, I\r\nsay openly, I am no man’s _man_, nor do I belong to any personal party.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE TERM FOR PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to change the character of the Republican Party begins by\r\nassault on the principle of One Term for President. Therefore must\r\nour support of this requirement be made manifest; and here we have\r\nthe testimony of our President, and what is stronger, his example,\r\nshowing the necessity of such limitation. Authentic report attests that\r\nbefore his nomination he declared that “the liberties of the country\r\ncannot be maintained without a One-Term Amendment of the Constitution.”\r\nAt this time Mr. Wade was pressing this very Amendment. Then after\r\nhis nomination, and while his election was pending, the organ of\r\nthe Republican Party at Washington, where he resided, commended him\r\nconstantly as faithful to the principle. The “Morning Chronicle” of\r\nJune 3, 1868, after the canvass had commenced, proclaimed of the\r\ncandidate,--\r\n\r\n    “_He is, moreover, an advocate of the One-Term principle_, as\r\n    conducing toward the proper administration of the law,--a principle\r\n    with which so many prominent Republicans have identified themselves\r\n    that it may be accepted as an article of party faith.”\r\n\r\nThen again, July 14th, the same organ insisted,--\r\n\r\n    “Let not Congress adjourn without passing the One-Term Amendment to\r\n    the Constitution. There has never been so favorable an opportunity.\r\n    All parties are in favor of it.… _General Grant is in favor of it._\r\n    The party which supports General Grant demands it; and above all\r\n    else public morality calls for it.”\r\n\r\nConsidering that these pledges were made by an organ of the party, and\r\nin his very presence, they may be accepted as proceeding from him.\r\nHis name must be added to the list with Andrew Jackson, William Henry\r\nHarrison, Henry Clay, and Benjamin F. Wade, all of whom are enrolled\r\nagainst the reëligibility of a President.\r\n\r\nBut his example as President is more than his testimony in showing\r\nthe necessity of this limitation. Andrew Jackson did not hesitate\r\nto say that it was required in order to place the President “beyond\r\nthe reach of any improper influences,” and “uncommitted to any other\r\ncourse than the strict line of constitutional duty.”[164] William Henry\r\nHarrison followed in declaring that with the adoption of this principle\r\n“the incumbent would devote all his time to the public interest, and\r\nthere would be no cause to misrule the country.”[165] Henry Clay was\r\nsatisfied, after much observation and reflection, “that too much of the\r\ntime, the thoughts, and the exertions of the incumbent are occupied\r\nduring his first term in securing his reëlection.”[166] Benjamin F.\r\nWade, after denouncing the reëligibility of the President, said:\r\n“There are defects in the Constitution, and this is among the most\r\nglaring.”[167]\r\n\r\nAnd now our President by his example, besides his testimony,\r\nvindicates all these authorities. He makes us see how all that has\r\nbeen predicted of Presidents seeking reëlection is fulfilled: how\r\nthis desire dominates official conduct; how naturally the resources\r\nof the Government are employed to serve a personal purpose; how the\r\nnational interests are subordinate to individual advancement; how\r\nall questions, foreign or domestic, whether of treaties or laws, are\r\nhandled with a view to electoral votes; how the appointing power lends\r\nitself to a selfish will, acting now by the temptation of office\r\nand then by the menace of removal; and, since every office-holder\r\nand every office-seeker has a brevet commission in the predominant\r\npolitical party, how the President, desiring reëlection, becomes the\r\nactive head of three coöperating armies,--the army of office-holders,\r\neighty thousand strong, the larger army of office-seekers, and the\r\narmy of the political party, the whole constituting a consolidated\r\npower which no candidate can possess without peril to his country.\r\nOf these vast coöperating armies the President is commander-in-chief\r\nand generalissimo. Through these he holds in submission even\r\nRepresentatives and Senators, and makes the country his vassal with a\r\ncondition not unlike that of martial law, where the disobedient are\r\nshot, while the various rings help secure the prize. That this is not\r\ntoo strong appears from testimony before a Senate Committee, where a\r\nPresidential lieutenant boldly denounced an eminent New York citizen,\r\nwho was a prominent candidate for Governor, as “obnoxious to General\r\nGrant,”--and then, with an effrontery like the Presidential pretension,\r\nannounced that “President Grant was the representative and head of the\r\nRepublican Party, and all good Republicans should support him in all\r\nhis measures and appointments, and any one who did not do it should be\r\n_crushed out_.”[168] Such things teach how wise were those statesmen\r\nwho would not subject the President to the temptation or even the\r\nsuspicion of using his vast powers in promoting personal ends.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably the One-Man Power has increased latterly beyond\r\nexample,--owing partly to the greater facilities of intercourse,\r\nespecially by telegraph, so that the whole country is easily\r\nreached,--partly to improvements in organization, by which distant\r\nplaces are brought into unity,--and partly through the protracted\r\nprevalence of the military spirit created by the war. There was a\r\ntime in English history when the House of Commons, on the motion of\r\nthe famous lawyer Mr. Dunning, adopted the resolution, “That the\r\ninfluence of the Crown has increased, is increasing, and ought to be\r\ndiminished.”[169] The same declaration is needed with regard to the\r\nPresident; and the very words of the Parliamentary patriot may be\r\nrepeated. In his memorable speech, Mr. Dunning, after saying that he\r\ndid not rest “upon proof idle to require,” declared that the question\r\n“must be decided by the consciences of those who as a jury were called\r\nupon to determine what was or was not within their own knowledge.”[170]\r\nIt was on ground of notoriety cognizable to all that he acted. And\r\nprecisely on this ground, but also with specific proofs, do I insist\r\nthat the influence of the President has increased, is increasing, and\r\nought to be diminished. But in this excellent work, well worthy the\r\nbest efforts of all, nothing is more important than the limitation to\r\none term.\r\n\r\nThere is a demand for reform in the civil service, and the President\r\nformally adopts this demand; but he neglects the first step, which\r\ndepends only on himself. From this we may judge his little earnestness\r\nin the cause. Beyond all question Civil-Service Reform must begin by a\r\nlimitation of the President to one term, so that the temptation to use\r\nthe appointing power for personal ends may disappear from our system,\r\nand this great disturbing force cease to exist. If the President is\r\nsincere for reform, it will be easy for him to set the example by\r\ndeclaring again his adhesion to the One-Term principle. But even if he\r\nfails, we must do our duty.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in opposing the prolonged power of the present incumbent,\r\nI begin by insisting, that, for the good of the country, and without\r\nreference to any personal failure, no President should be a candidate\r\nfor reëlection; and it is our duty now to set an example worthy of\r\nrepublican institutions. In the name of the One-Term principle, once\r\nrecognized by him, and which needs no other evidence of its necessity\r\nthan his own Presidency, I protest against his attempt to obtain\r\nanother lease of power. But this protest is on the threshold.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS UNFITNESS FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE.\r\n\r\nI protest against him as radically unfit for the Presidential office,\r\nbeing essentially military in nature, without experience in civil\r\nlife, without aptitude for civil duties, and without knowledge of\r\nrepublican institutions,--all of which is perfectly apparent, unless we\r\nare ready to assume that the matters and things set forth to-day are\r\nof no account, and then, in further support of the candidate, boldly\r\ndeclare that nepotism in a President is nothing, that gift-taking with\r\nrepayment in official patronage is nothing, that violation of the\r\nConstitution and of International and Municipal Law is nothing, that\r\nindignity to the African race is nothing, that quarrel with political\r\nassociates is nothing, and that all his Presidential pretensions in\r\ntheir motley aggregation, being a new Cæsarism or personal government,\r\nare nothing. But if these are all nothing, then is the Republican Party\r\nnothing, nor is there any safeguard for Republican Institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPOLOGIES FOR THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nTwo apologies I hear. The first is that he means well, and errs\r\nfrom want of knowledge. This is not much. It was said of Louis the\r\nQuarreller, that he meant well; nor is there a slate head-stone in any\r\nvillage burial-ground that does not record as much of the humble lodger\r\nbeneath. Something more is needed for a President. Nor can we afford to\r\nperpetuate power in a ruler who errs so much from ignorance. Charity\r\nfor the past I concede, but no investiture for the future.\r\n\r\nThe other apology is, that his Presidency has been successful. How?\r\nWhen? Where? Not to him can be attributed that general prosperity\r\nwhich is the natural outgrowth of our people and country; for his\r\ncontribution is not traced in the abounding result. Our golden fields,\r\nproductive mines, busy industry, diversified commerce, owe nothing to\r\nhim. Show, then, his success. Is it in the finances? The national debt\r\nhas been reduced, but not to so large an amount as by Andrew Johnson\r\nin the same space of time. Little merit is due to either, for each\r\nemployed the means allowed by Congress. To the American people is\r\nthis reduction due, and not to any President. And while our President\r\nin this respect is no better than his predecessor, he can claim no\r\nmerit for any systematic effort to reduce taxation or restore specie\r\npayments. Perhaps, then, it is in foreign relations that he claims\r\nthe laurels he is to wear. Knowing something of these from careful\r\nstudy and years of practical acquaintance, I am bound to say that\r\nnever before has their management been so wanting in ability and so\r\nabsolutely without character. With so much pretension and so little\r\nknowledge, how could it be otherwise? Here the President touches\r\nnothing which he does not muddle. In every direction is muddle,--muddle\r\nwith Spain, muddle with Cuba, muddle with the Black Republic, muddle\r\nwith distant Corea, muddle with Venezuela, muddle with Russia, muddle\r\nwith England,--on all sides one diversified muddle. If there is not\r\nmuddle with Germany and France, it must be from their forbearance.\r\nTo this condition are we reduced. When before in our history have\r\nwe reached any such bathos as that to which we have been carried in\r\nour questions with England? Are these the laurels for a Presidential\r\ncandidate?\r\n\r\nBut where else shall we look for them? Are they found on the Indian\r\nfrontier? Let the cry of massacre and blood from that distant region\r\nanswer. Are they in reform of the civil service? But here the initial\r\npoint is the limitation of the President to one term, so that he may\r\nbe placed above temptation; yet this he opposes. Evidently he is no\r\ntrue reformer. Are these laurels found in the administration of the\r\nDepartments? Let the discreditable sale of arms to France in violation\r\nof neutral duties and of municipal statute be the answer; and let\r\nthe custom-houses of New York and New Orleans, with their tales of\r\nfavoritism and of nepotism, and with their prostitution as agencies,\r\nmercenary and political, echo back the answer; while senatorial\r\ncommittees, organized contrary to a cardinal principle of Parliamentary\r\nLaw as a cover to these scandals, testify also. And again, let the War\r\nDepartment recall the disappearance of important archives bearing on an\r\nimportant event of the war, so that empty boxes remain like a coffin\r\nwithout a corpse. Where, then, are the laurels? At last I find them,\r\nfresh and brilliant, in the harmony which the President has preserved\r\namong Republicans. Harmony, do I say? This should have been his\r\ncongenial task; nor would any aid or homage of mine have been wanting.\r\nBut instead he has organized discord, operating through a succession of\r\nrings, and for laurels we find only weeds and thistles.\r\n\r\nBut I hear that he is successful in the States once in rebellion.\r\nStrange that this should be said while we are harrowed by the reports\r\nof Ku-Klux outrages. Here, as in paying the national debt, Congress has\r\nbeen the effective power. Even the last extraordinary measure became\r\nnecessary, in my judgment, to supplement his little efficiency. Had\r\nthe President put into the protection of the colored people at the\r\nSouth half the effort and earnest will with which he maintained his\r\nSan Domingo contrivance, the murderous Ku-Klux would have been driven\r\nfrom the field and peace assured. Nor has he ever exhibited to the\r\ncolored people any true sympathy. His conduct to Frederick Douglass\r\non his return from San Domingo is an illustration; and so also was\r\nhis answer to the committee of colored fellow-citizens seeking his\r\ncountenance for the pending measure of Civil Rights. Some thought him\r\nindifferent; others found him insulting. Then came his recent letter to\r\nthe great meeting at Washington, May 9, 1872, called to assert these\r\nrights, where he could say nothing more than this: “I beg to assure\r\nyou, however, that I sympathize most cordially in any effort to secure\r\nfor all our people, of whatever race, nativity, or color, _the exercise\r\nof those rights to which every citizen should be entitled_.”[171] Of\r\ncourse everybody is in favor of “the rights to which every citizen\r\nshould be entitled.” But what are these rights? And this meaningless\r\njuggle of words, entirely worthy of the days of Slavery, is all that\r\nis vouchsafed by a Republican President for the equal rights of his\r\ncolored fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nI dismiss the apologies with the conclusion, that in the matters to\r\nwhich they invite attention his Presidency is an enormous failure.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT AS CANDIDATE.\r\n\r\nLooking at his daily life as it becomes known through the press\r\nor conversation, his chief employment seems the dispensation of\r\npatronage, unless society is an employment. For this he is visited\r\ndaily by Senators and Representatives bringing distant constituents.\r\nThe Executive Mansion has become that famous “Treasury trough”\r\ndescribed so well by an early Congressional orator:--\r\n\r\n    “Such running, such jostling, such wriggling, such clambering over\r\n    one another’s backs, such squealing, because the tub is so narrow\r\n    and the company is so crowded.”[172]\r\n\r\nTo sit behind is the Presidential occupation, watching and feeding the\r\nanimals. If this were an amusement only, it might be pardoned; but it\r\nmust be seen in a more serious light. Some nations are governed by\r\nthe sword,--in other words, by central force commanding obedience.\r\nOur President governs by offices,--in other words, by the appointing\r\npower, being a central force by which he coerces obedience to his\r\npersonal will. Let a Senator or Representative hesitate in the support\r\nof his autocracy, or doubt if he merits a second term, and forthwith\r\nsome distant consul or postmaster, appointed by his influence, begins\r\nto tremble. The “Head Centre” makes himself felt to the most distant\r\ncircumference. Can such tyranny, where the military spirit of our\r\nPresident finds a congenial field, be permitted to endure?\r\n\r\nIn adopting him as a candidate for reëlection we undertake to vindicate\r\nhis Presidency, and adopt in all things the insulting, incapable,\r\naide-de-campish dictatorship which he has inaugurated. Presenting his\r\nname, we vouch for his fitness, not only in original nature, but in\r\nexperience of civil life, in aptitude for civil duties, in knowledge\r\nof republican institutions, and elevation of purpose; and we must\r\nbe ready to defend openly what he has openly done. Can Republicans\r\nhonestly do this thing? Let it be said that he is not only the greatest\r\nnepotist among Presidents, but greater than all others together, and\r\nwhat Republican can reply? Let it be said that he is not only the\r\ngreatest gift-taker among Presidents, but the only one who repaid his\r\npatrons at the public expense, and what Republican can reply? Let it\r\nbe said that he has openly violated the Constitution and International\r\nLaw, in the prosecution of a wretched contrivance against the peace\r\nof San Domingo, and what Republican can reply? Let it be said, that,\r\nwielding the power of the Great Republic, he has insulted the Black\r\nRepublic with a menace of war, involving indignity to the African\r\nRace, and what Republican can reply? Let it be said that he has set\r\nup Presidential pretensions without number, constituting an undoubted\r\nCæsarism or personal government, and what Republican can reply? And let\r\nit be added, that, unconscious of all this misrule, he quarrels without\r\ncause even with political supporters, and on such a scale as to become\r\nthe greatest Presidential quarreller of our history, quarrelling more\r\nthan all other Presidents together, and what Republican can reply? It\r\nwill not be enough to say that he was triumphant in war,--as Scipio,\r\nthe victor of Hannibal, reminded the Roman people that on this day\r\nhe conquered at Zama.[173] Others have been triumphant in war and\r\nfailed in civil life,--as Marlborough, whose heroic victories seemed\r\nunaccountable, in the frivolity, the ignorance, and the heartlessness\r\nof his pretended statesmanship. To Washington was awarded that rarest\r\ntribute, “First in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his\r\ncountrymen.”[174] Of our President it will be said willingly, “first in\r\nwar,” but the candid historian will add, “first in nepotism, first in\r\ngift-taking and repaying by official patronage, first in Presidential\r\npretensions, and first in quarrel with his countrymen.”\r\n\r\nAnxiously, earnestly, the country asks for reform, and stands tiptoe\r\nto greet the coming. But how expect reform from a President who needs\r\nit so much himself? Who shall reform the reformer? So also does the\r\ncountry ask for purity. But is it not vain to seek this boon from one\r\nwhose Presidential pretensions are so demoralizing? Who shall purify\r\nthe purifier? The country asks for reform in the civil service. But how\r\nexpect any such change from one who will not allow the Presidential\r\noffice to be secured against its worst temptation? The country desires\r\nan example for the youth of the land, where intelligence shall blend\r\nwith character, and both be elevated by a constant sense of duty with\r\nunselfish devotion to the public weal. But how accord this place to\r\na President who makes his great office a plaything and perquisite,\r\nwhile his highest industry is in quarrelling? Since Sancho Panza at\r\nBarataria, no Governor has provided so well for his relations at the\r\nexpense of his country; and if any other has made Cabinet appointments\r\nthe return for personal favors, his name has dropped out of history.\r\nA man is known by his acts; so also by the company he keeps. And is\r\nnot our President known by his intimacy with those who are by-words of\r\ndistrust? But all these by-words look to another term for perpetuation\r\nof their power. Therefore, for the sake of reform and purity, which are\r\na longing of the people, and also that the Chief Magistrate may be an\r\nexample, we must seek a remedy.\r\n\r\nSee for one moment how pernicious must be the Presidential example.\r\nFirst in place, his personal influence is far-reaching beyond that of\r\nany other citizen. What he does others will do. What he fails to do\r\nothers will fail to do. His standard of conduct will be accepted at\r\nleast by his political supporters. His measure of industry and his\r\nsense of duty will be the pattern for the country. If he appoints\r\nrelations to office and repays gifts by official patronage, making\r\nhis Presidency a great “gift-enterprise,” may not every office-holder\r\ndo likewise, each in his sphere, so that nepotism and gift-taking\r\nwith official remuneration will be general, and gift-enterprises be\r\nmultiplied indefinitely in the public service? If he treats his trust\r\nas plaything and perquisite, why may not every office-holder do the\r\nsame? If he disregards Constitution and Law in the pursuit of personal\r\nobjects, how can we expect a just subordination from others? If he sets\r\nup pretensions without number repugnant to republican institutions,\r\nmust not the good cause suffer? If he is stubborn, obstinate, and\r\nperverse, are not stubbornness, obstinacy, and perversity commended\r\nfor imitation? If he insults and wrongs associates in official trust,\r\nwho is safe from the malignant influence having its propulsion from\r\nthe Executive Mansion? If he fraternizes with jobbers and Hessians,\r\nwhere is the limit to the demoralization that must ensue? Necessarily\r\nthe public service takes its character from its elected chief, and the\r\nwhole country reflects the President. His example is a law. But a bad\r\nexample must be corrected as a bad law.\r\n\r\nTo the Republican Party, devoted to ideas and principles, I turn\r\nnow with more than ordinary solicitude. Not willingly can I see it\r\nsacrificed. Not without earnest effort against the betrayal can I\r\nsuffer its ideas and principles to be lost in the personal pretensions\r\nof one man. Both the old parties are in a crisis, with this difference\r\nbetween the two: the Democracy is dissolving, the Republican party is\r\nbeing absorbed; the Democracy is falling apart, thus visibly losing\r\nits vital unity,--the Republican Party is submitting to a personal\r\ninfluence, thus visibly losing its vital character; the Democracy is\r\nceasing to exist, the Republican Party is losing its identity. Let the\r\nprocess be completed, and it will be no longer that Republican Party\r\nwhich I helped to found and have always served, but only a personal\r\nparty,--while instead of those ideas and principles which we have been\r\nso proud to uphold will be Presidential pretensions, and instead of\r\nRepublicanism there will be nothing but Grantism.\r\n\r\nPolitical parties are losing their sway. Higher than party are country\r\nand the duty to save it from Cæsar. The Caucus is at last understood\r\nas a political engine moved by wire-pullers, and it becomes more\r\ninsupportable in proportion as directed to personal ends. Nor is\r\nits character changed when called a National Convention. Here, too,\r\nare wire-pullers; and when the great Office-Holder and the great\r\nOffice-Seeker are one and the same, it is easy to see how naturally\r\nthe engine responds to the central touch. A political convention is\r\nan agency and convenience, but never a law, least of all a despotism;\r\nand when it seeks to impose a candidate whose name is a synonym of\r\npretensions unrepublican in character and hostile to good government,\r\nit will be for earnest Republicans to consider well how clearly\r\nparty is subordinate to country. Such a nomination can have no just\r\nobligation. Therefore with unspeakable interest will the country watch\r\nthe National Convention at Philadelphia. It may be an assembly (and\r\nsuch is my hope) where ideas and principles are above all personal\r\npretensions, and the unity of the party is symbolized in the candidate;\r\nor it may add another to Presidential rings, being an expansion of the\r\nmilitary ring at the Executive Mansion, the senatorial ring in this\r\nChamber, and the political ring in the custom-houses of New York and\r\nNew Orleans. A National Convention which is a Presidential ring cannot\r\nrepresent the Republican Party.\r\n\r\nMuch rather would I see the party to which I am dedicated, under the\r\nimage of a life-boat not to be sunk by wind or wave. How often have I\r\nsaid this to cheer my comrades! I do not fear the Democratic Party.\r\nNothing from them can harm our life-boat. But I do fear a quarrelsome\r\npilot, unused to the sea, but pretentious in command, who occupies\r\nhimself in loading aboard his own unserviceable relations and personal\r\npatrons, while he drives away the experienced seamen who know the craft\r\nand her voyage. Here is a peril which no life-boat can stand.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I wait the determination of the National Convention, where\r\nare delegates from my own much-honored Commonwealth with whom I rejoice\r\nto act. Not without anxiety do I wait, but with the earnest hope that\r\nthe Convention will bring the Republican Party into ancient harmony,\r\nsaving it especially from the suicidal folly of an issue on the\r\npersonal pretensions of one man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTEREST AND DUTY OF COLORED CITIZENS IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO COLORED CITIZENS, JULY 29, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I will say to the North, Give up; and to the South, Keep not\r\n    back.--ISAIAH, xliii. 6.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The immediate occasion of the present Letter appears in the\r\n    following, from colored citizens of Washington to Mr. Sumner:--\r\n\r\n                                      WASHINGTON, D. C., July 11, 1872.\r\n\r\n        SIR,--We, the undersigned, citizens of color, regarding you\r\n        as the purest and best friend of our race, admiring your\r\n        consistent course in the United States Senate and elsewhere\r\n        as the special advocate of our rights, and believing that\r\n        your counsel at this critical juncture in the period of our\r\n        citizenship would be free from personal feeling and partisan\r\n        prejudice, have ventured to request your opinion as to what\r\n        action the colored voters of the nation should take in the\r\n        Presidential contest now pending.\r\n\r\n        The choice of our people is now narrowed down to General Grant\r\n        or Horace Greeley. Your long acquaintance with both and your\r\n        observation have enabled you to arrive at a correct conclusion\r\n        as to which of the candidates, judging from their antecedents\r\n        as well as their present position, will, if elected, enforce\r\n        the requirements of the Constitution and the laws respecting\r\n        our civil and political rights with the most heart-felt\r\n        sympathy and the greatest vigor.\r\n\r\n        We hope and trust you will favor us with such reply as will\r\n        serve to enlighten our minds upon this subject and impel our\r\n        people to go forward in the right direction. Our confidence in\r\n        your judgment is so firm, that, in our opinion, thousands of\r\n        the intelligent colored voters of the country will be guided in\r\n        their action by your statement and advice.\r\n\r\n        Hoping to receive a reply soon, we have the honor to be,\r\n\r\n            With great respect,\r\n\r\n                Your obedient servants,\r\n\r\n                    A. T. AUGUSTA, M. D.    SAMUEL PROCTOR.\r\n                    DAVID FISHER, sr.       J. J. KETCHUM.\r\n                    JNO. H. SMITH.          CHAS. N.

CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, July 29, 1872.\r\n\r\n  GENTLEMEN AND FELLOW-CITIZENS:--\r\n\r\n  If I have delayed answering your communication of July 11th, which\r\n  was duly placed in my hands by your committee, it was not because\r\n  the proper course for you seemed doubtful, but because I wished to\r\n  reflect upon it and be aided by information which time might supply.\r\n  Since then I have carefully considered the inquiries addressed to me,\r\n  and have listened to much on both sides; but my best judgment now is\r\n  in harmony with my early conclusion.\r\n\r\n  I am touched by the appeal you make. It is true that I am the friend\r\n  of your race, and I am glad to be assured that in your opinion I have\r\n  held a consistent course in the Senate and elsewhere as the special\r\n  advocate of your rights. That course, by the blessing of God, I mean\r\n  to hold so long as life lasts. I know your infinite wrongs, and feel\r\n  for them as my own. You only do me simple justice, when you add a\r\n  belief that my counsel at this critical juncture of your citizenship\r\n  “would be free from personal feelings and partisan prejudice.” In\r\n  answering your inquiries I can have no sentiment except for your\r\n  good, which I most anxiously seek; nor can any disturbing influence\r\n  be allowed to interfere. The occasion is too solemn. Especially is\r\n  there no room for personal feeling or for partisan prejudice. No man\r\n  or party can expect power except for the general welfare. Therefore\r\n  they must be brought to the standard of truth, which is without\r\n  feeling or prejudice.\r\n\r\n\r\n  QUESTIONS PROPOSED.\r\n\r\n  You are right in saying that the choice for the Presidency is\r\n  now “narrowed down” to President Grant or Horace Greeley. One of\r\n  these is to be taken, and, assuming my acquaintance with both and\r\n  my observation of their lives, you invite my judgment between\r\n  them, asking me especially which of the two, “_judging from their\r\n  antecedents as well as present position_,” would enforce the\r\n  Constitution and laws securing your civil and political rights “with\r\n  _the most heart-felt sympathy and the greatest vigor_.” Here I remark\r\n  that in this inquiry you naturally put your rights in the foreground.\r\n  So do I,--believing most sincerely that the best interests of the\r\n  whole country are associated with the completest recognition of\r\n  your rights, so that the two races shall live together in unbroken\r\n  harmony. I also remark that you call attention to two things,--the\r\n  “antecedents” of the candidates, and their “present position.” You\r\n  wish to know from these which gives assurance of the most heart-felt\r\n  sympathy and greatest vigor in the maintenance of your rights,--in\r\n  other words, which, judging by the past, will be your truest friend.\r\n\r\n  The communication with which you have honored me is not alone.\r\n  Colored fellow-citizens in other parts of the country, I may say in\r\n  nearly every State of the Union, have made a similar request, and\r\n  some complain that I have thus far kept silent. I am not insensible\r\n  to the trust reposed in me. But if my opinion is given, it must be\r\n  candidly, according to my conscience. In this spirit I answer your\r\n  inquiries, beginning with the antecedents of the two candidates.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ANTECEDENTS OF THE CANDIDATES.\r\n\r\n  Horace Greeley was born to poverty and educated himself in a\r\n  printing-office. President Grant, fortunate in early patronage,\r\n  became a cadet at West Point and was educated at the public expense.\r\n  One started with nothing but industry and character; the other\r\n  started with a military commission. One was trained as a civilian;\r\n  the other as a soldier. Horace Greeley stood forth as a Reformer and\r\n  Abolitionist. President Grant enlisted as a Proslavery Democrat,\r\n  and, at the election of James Buchanan, fortified by his vote all\r\n  the pretensions of Slavery, including the Dred Scott decision.\r\n  Horace Greeley from early life was earnest and constant against\r\n  Slavery, full of sympathy with the colored race, and always foremost\r\n  in the great battle for their rights. President Grant, except as a\r\n  soldier summoned by the terrible accident of war, never did anything\r\n  against Slavery, nor has he at any time shown any sympathy with\r\n  the colored race, but rather indifference, if not aversion. Horace\r\n  Greeley earnestly desired that colored citizens should vote, and ably\r\n  championed impartial suffrage; but President Grant was on the other\r\n  side.\r\n\r\n  Beyond these contrasts, which are marked, it cannot be forgotten that\r\n  Horace Greeley is a person of large heart and large understanding,\r\n  trained to the support of Human Rights, always beneficent to\r\n  the poor, always ready for any good cause, and never deterred by\r\n  opposition or reproach, as when for long years he befriended your\r\n  people. Add to these qualities, conspicuous in his life, untiring\r\n  industry which leaves no moment without its fruit, abundant political\r\n  knowledge, acquaintance with history, the instinct and grasp of\r\n  statesmanship, an amiable nature, a magnanimous soul, and above all\r\n  an honesty which no suspicion has touched,--and you have a brief\r\n  portraiture where are antecedents of Horace Greeley.\r\n\r\n  Few of these things appear in the President. His great success in\r\n  war, and the honors he has won, cannot change the record of his\r\n  conduct toward your people, especially in contrast with the life-time\r\n  fidelity of his competitor, while there are unhappy “antecedents”\r\n  showing that in the prosecution of his plans he cares nothing for the\r\n  colored race. The story is painful; but it must be told.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GRANT’S INDIGNITY TO THE COLORED RACE.\r\n\r\n  I refer to the outrage he perpetrated upon Hayti, with its six\r\n  hundred thousand blacks engaged in the great experiment of\r\n  self-government. Here is a most instructive “antecedent,” revealing\r\n  beyond question his true nature, and the whole is attested by\r\n  documentary evidence. Conceiving the idea of annexing Dominica, which\r\n  is the Spanish part of the island, and shrinking at nothing, he began\r\n  by seizing the war powers of the Government, in flagrant violation\r\n  of the Constitution, and then, at great expenditure of money, sent\r\n  several armed ships of the Navy, including monitors, to maintain the\r\n  usurper Baez in power, that through him he might obtain the coveted\r\n  prize. Not content with this audacious dictatorship, he proceeded to\r\n  strike at the independence of the Black Republic by open menace of\r\n  war, and all without the sanction of Congress, to which is committed\r\n  the power to make war. Sailing into the harbor of Port-au-Prince with\r\n  our most powerful monitor, the Dictator, (properly named for this\r\n  service,) also the frigate Severn as consort, and other monitors in\r\n  their train, the Admiral, acting under instructions from Washington,\r\n  proceeded to the Executive Mansion accompanied by officers of his\r\n  squadron, and then, pointing to the great war-ships in sight from\r\n  the windows, dealt his unjust menace, threatening to sink or capture\r\n  Haytian ships. The President was black, not white. The Admiral would\r\n  have done no such thing to any white ruler, nor would our country\r\n  have tolerated such menace from any Government in the world. Here was\r\n  indignity not only to the Black Republic with its population of six\r\n  hundred thousand, but to the African race everywhere, and especially\r\n  in our own country. Nor did it end here. For months the Navy of the\r\n  United States was kept hovering on the coast, holding that insulted\r\n  people in constant dread and anxiety, while President Grant was to\r\n  them like a hawk sailing in the air, ready to swoop upon his prey.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FALSE IMPRISONMENT OF AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.\r\n\r\n  This heartless, cruel proceeding found a victim among our white\r\n  fellow-citizens. An excellent merchant of Connecticut, praised by all\r\n  who know him, was plunged into prison by Baez, where he was immured\r\n  because it was feared that on his return to New York he would expose\r\n  the frauds of the plotters; and this captivity was prolonged with the\r\n  connivance of two agents of the President, one of whom finds constant\r\n  favor with him and is part of the military ring immediately about\r\n  him. That such an outrage could go unpunished shows the little regard\r\n  of the President for human rights, whether in white or black.\r\n\r\n\r\n  HARD TO BEAR THESE OUTRAGES.\r\n\r\n  I confess my trials, as I was called to witness these things.\r\n  Always a supporter of the Administration, and sincerely desiring\r\n  to labor with it, I had never uttered a word with regard to it\r\n  except in kindness. My early opposition to the Treaty of Annexion\r\n  was reserved, so that for some time my opinions were unknown. It\r\n  was only when I saw the breach of all law, human and divine, that I\r\n  was aroused; and then began the anger of the President and of his\r\n  rings, military and senatorial. Devoted to the African race, I felt\r\n  for them,--besides being humbled that the Great Republic, acting\r\n  through its President, could set such an example, where the National\r\n  Constitution, International Law, and Humanity were all sacrificed.\r\n  Especially was I moved when I saw the indignity to the colored race,\r\n  which was accomplished by trampling upon a fundamental principle\r\n  of International Law, declaring the equality of nations, as our\r\n  Declaration of Independence declares the equality of men.\r\n\r\n  This terrible transaction, which nobody can defend, is among the\r\n  “antecedents” of President Grant, from which you can judge how much\r\n  the colored race can rely upon his “heart-felt sympathy.” Nor can it\r\n  be forgotten that shortly afterward, on the return of the Commission\r\n  from this island, Hon. Frederick Douglass, the colored orator,\r\n  accomplished in manners as in eloquence, was thrust away from the\r\n  company of the Commissioners at the common table of the mail-packet\r\n  on the Potomac, almost within sight of the Executive Mansion, simply\r\n  on account of his color; but the President, at whose invitation he\r\n  had joined the Commission, never uttered a word in condemnation of\r\n  this exclusion, and when entertaining the returned Commissioners at\r\n  dinner carefully omitted Mr. Douglass, who was in Washington at the\r\n  time, and thus repeated the indignity.\r\n\r\n\r\n  OTHER ANTECEDENTS.\r\n\r\n  Other things might be mentioned, showing the sympathies of the\r\n  President; but I cannot forget the Civil Rights Bill, which is the\r\n  cap-stone of that Equality before the Law to which all are entitled\r\n  without distinction of color. President Grant, who could lobby so\r\n  assiduously for his San Domingo scheme, full of wrong to the colored\r\n  race, could do nothing for this beneficent measure. During a long\r\n  session of Congress it was discussed constantly, and the colored\r\n  people everywhere hung upon the debate; but there was no word of\r\n  “heart-felt sympathy” from the President. At last, just before the\r\n  Nominating Convention, he addressed a letter to a meeting of colored\r\n  fellow-citizens in Washington, called to advance this cause, where he\r\n  avoided the question by declaring himself in favor of “the exercise\r\n  of those rights to which every citizen should be entitled,”[175]\r\n  leaving it uncertain whether colored people are justly entitled to\r\n  the rights secured by the pending bill. I understand that Horace\r\n  Greeley has been already assailed by an impracticable Democrat as\r\n  friendly to this bill; but nobody has lisped against President Grant\r\n  on this account.\r\n\r\n  Among “antecedents” I deem it my duty to mention the little capacity\r\n  or industry of the President in protecting colored people and in\r\n  assuring peace at the South. Nobody can doubt that a small portion\r\n  of the effort and earnest will, even without the lobbying, so freely\r\n  given to the San Domingo scheme, would have averted those Ku-Klux\r\n  outrages which we deplore,--thus superseding all pretence for further\r\n  legislation by Congress. But he is disabled both by character and\r\n  the drawback of his own conduct. After violating the Constitution\r\n  and International Law to insult the Black Republic, and setting\r\n  an example of insubordination, he is not in condition to rebuke\r\n  law-breakers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PRESENT POSITION OF CANDIDATES.\r\n\r\n  Passing from “antecedents,” I come now to the “present position”\r\n  of the two candidates, which is the subject of your next inquiry.\r\n  If in any formal particulars the two are on equality, yet in all\r\n  substantial respects the obvious advantage is with Horace Greeley.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOMINATIONS OF THE TWO CANDIDATES.\r\n\r\n  Each was nominated by a Republican Convention, one at Cincinnati\r\n  and the other at Philadelphia; so that in this respect they may\r\n  seem to be on equality. But it will not fail to be observed that\r\n  the Convention at Cincinnati was composed of able and acknowledged\r\n  Republicans, many having acted with the party from its first\r\n  formation, who, without previous organization, came together\r\n  voluntarily for the sake of Reform and Purity in the Government;\r\n  while, on the other hand, the Convention at Philadelphia was composed\r\n  of delegates chosen largely under the influence of office-holders,\r\n  who assembled to sustain what is known as Grantism, being the\r\n  personal government and personal pretensions of President Grant,\r\n  involving nepotism, repayment of gifts by official patronage, neglect\r\n  of public duty, absenteeism, quarrelling, military rule, disregard\r\n  of Constitution and Law, with general unfitness, and indignity to\r\n  the colored race,--all of which is so unrepublican as to make its\r\n  support impossible for true Republicans. Therefore the Convention at\r\n  Philadelphia, though calling itself Republican, was less Republican\r\n  in reality than that at Cincinnati.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE TWO PLATFORMS.\r\n\r\n  The two platforms, so far as concerns especially the colored race,\r\n  are alike in substance; but that of Cincinnati is expressed in terms\r\n  more worthy of the equal rights it states and claims: “We recognize\r\n  the equality of all men before the law, and hold that it is the duty\r\n  of Government, in its dealings with the people, to mete out equal\r\n  and exact justice to all, of whatever nativity, race, color, or\r\n  persuasion, religious or political.” In other respects the platform\r\n  of Cincinnati is the more republican, inasmuch as it sets itself\r\n  against those unrepublican abuses which have been nursed by the\r\n  President into pernicious activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SUPPORTERS OF THE TWO CANDIDATES.\r\n\r\n  From the two nominations and two platforms I come to the supporters\r\n  of the candidates; and here I look, first, at those immediately about\r\n  them, and, secondly, at the popular support behind.\r\n\r\n  Horace Greeley has among his immediate supporters, in all parts of\r\n  the country, devoted and consistent Republicans, always earnest for\r\n  Reform and Purity in Government, on whose lives there is no shadow\r\n  of suspicion,--being a contrast in character to those rings which\r\n  play such a part in the present Administration. The country knows too\r\n  well the Military Ring, the Senatorial Ring, and the Custom-House\r\n  Ring, through which the President acts. Such supporters are a poor\r\n  recommendation.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DEMOCRATS TURNING REPUBLICANS.\r\n\r\n  Looking at the popular support behind, the advantage is still with\r\n  Horace Greeley. President Grant has at his back the diversified army\r\n  of office-holders, drilled to obey the word of command. The speeches\r\n  praising him are by office-holders and members of rings. Horace\r\n  Greeley finds flocking to his cause large numbers of Republicans\r\n  unwilling to continue the existing misrule, and as allies with them\r\n  a regenerated party springing forward to unite in this liberal\r\n  movement. Democrats, in joining Horace Greeley, have changed simply\r\n  as President Grant changed when he joined the Republicans,--except\r\n  that he was rewarded at once with high office. The change is open.\r\n  Adopting the Republican platform, which places the Equal Rights of\r\n  All under the safeguard of irreversible guaranties, and at the\r\n  same time accepting the nomination of a life-time Abolitionist, who\r\n  represents preëminently the sentiment of duty to the colored race,\r\n  they have set their corporate seal to the sacred covenant. They may\r\n  continue Democrats in name, but they are in reality Republicans,\r\n  by the same title that those who sustain Republican principles are\r\n  Republicans,--or rather they are Democrats, according to the original\r\n  signification of that word, dedicated to the rights of the people.\r\n\r\n  It is idle to say that Horace Greeley and the Republicans who\r\n  nominated him are any less Republican because Democrats unite with\r\n  them in support of cherished principles and the candidate who\r\n  represents them. Conversions are always welcome, and not less so\r\n  because the change is in a multitude rather than an individual. A\r\n  political party cannot, if it would, and should not, if it could,\r\n  shut the door against converts, whether counted by the score, the\r\n  hundred, or the thousand; and so we find that the supporters of\r\n  President Grant announce with partisan triumph the adhesion of a\r\n  single Democratic politician or a single Democratic newspaper. On\r\n  equal reason and with higher pride may the supporters of Horace\r\n  Greeley announce the adhesion of the Democratic party, which, turning\r\n  from the things that are behind, presses on to those that are before.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GREELEY’S ELECTION THE TRIUMPH OF REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES.\r\n\r\n  It is also idle to say that the election of Horace Greeley as\r\n  President, with Gratz Brown as Vice-President, both unchangeable\r\n  Republicans, will be the return of the Democratic party to power. On\r\n  the contrary, it will be the inauguration of Republican principles,\r\n  under the safeguard of a Republican President and Republican\r\n  Vice-President, with Democrats as avowed supporters. In the\r\n  organization of his Administration, and in the conduct of affairs,\r\n  Horace Greeley will naturally lean upon those who represent best the\r\n  great promises of Equal Rights and Reconciliation made at Cincinnati.\r\n  If Democrats are taken, it will be as Republicans in heart,\r\n  recognizing the associate terms of the settlement as an immutable\r\n  finality.\r\n\r\n  The hardihood of political falsehood reaches its extreme point,\r\n  when it is asserted that under Horace Greeley the freedmen will be\r\n  reënslaved, or that colored people will in any way suffer in their\r\n  equal rights. On the contrary, they have in his election not only the\r\n  promises of the platform, but also his splendid example for a full\r\n  generation, during which he has never wavered in the assertion of\r\n  their rights. To suppose that Horace Greeley, when placed where he\r\n  can do them the most good, will depart from the rule of his honest\r\n  life is an insult to reason.\r\n\r\n  It is none the less idle to suppose that Democrats supporting\r\n  Horace Greeley expect or desire that he should depart from those\r\n  principles which are the glory of his character. They have accepted\r\n  the Cincinnati platform with its twofold promises, and intend in\r\n  good faith to maintain it. Democrats cannot turn back, who at the\r\n  Convention adopting this platform sang Greeley songs to the tune of\r\n  “Old John Brown, his soul is marching on.” Seeking especially the\r\n  establishment of character in the National Government, they will\r\n  expect their President to be always true to himself.\r\n\r\n  Therefore I put aside the partisan allegations, that Horace Greeley\r\n  has gone to the Democrats, or that he will be controlled by\r\n  Democrats. Each is without foundation or reason, according to my\r\n  judgment. They are attempts to avoid what you recognize as the true\r\n  issue, being the question between the two candidates; or perhaps\r\n  they may be considered as scarecrows to deter the timid. Nobody who\r\n  votes for Horace Greeley will go to the Democrats; nor do I believe,\r\n  that, when elected, Horace Greeley will be under any influence except\r\n  that enlightened conscience which will keep him ever true to the\r\n  principles he represents.\r\n\r\n  The conclusion from this comparison between the two candidates is\r\n  plain. Unquestionably the surest trust of the colored people is in\r\n  Horace Greeley. In everything for your protection and advancement he\r\n  will show always the most heart-felt sympathy and the greatest vigor\r\n  beyond what can be expected from President Grant. He is your truest\r\n  friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n  VOTE FOR GREELEY.\r\n\r\n  Gentlemen, in thus answering your two inquiries, I have shown why\r\n  you, as colored fellow-citizens, and also all who would uphold your\r\n  rights and save the colored race from indignity, should refuse to\r\n  sanction the reëlection of the President, and should put trust in\r\n  Horace Greeley. I ought to add, that with him will be associated\r\n  as Vice-President Gratz Brown, whom I have known for years as a\r\n  most determined Abolitionist. The two together will carry into the\r\n  National Government an unswerving devotion to your rights, not to be\r\n  disturbed by partisan dictation or sectional prejudice.\r\n\r\n  Besides all this, which may fitly guide you in determining between\r\n  the two candidates, it is my duty to remind you, that, as citizens\r\n  of the United States, and of part of the country, your welfare is\r\n  indissolubly associated with that of the whole country. Where all are\r\n  prosperous you will be gainers. Therefore, while justly careful of\r\n  your own rights, you cannot be indifferent to the blessings of good\r\n  government. It is for you to consider whether the time has not come\r\n  for something better than the sword, and whether a character like\r\n  Horace Greeley does not give stronger assurance of good government\r\n  than can be found in the insulter of the colored race, already famous\r\n  for the rings about him and his plain inaptitude for civil life.\r\n  The supporters of President Grant compel us to observe his offences\r\n  and shortcomings, and thus the painful contrast with Horace Greeley\r\n  becomes manifest. It will be for others in the present canvass to\r\n  hold it before the American people.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TOO MUCH OF A REPUBLICAN TO VOTE FOR GRANT.\r\n\r\n  Speaking now for myself, I have to say that my vote will be given\r\n  for Horace Greeley; but in giving it I do not go to the Democratic\r\n  party, nor am I any less a Republican. On the contrary, I am so much\r\n  of a Republican that I cannot support a candidate whose conduct in\r\n  civil life shows an incapacity to appreciate Republican principles,\r\n  and whose Administration is marked by acts of delinquency, especially\r\n  toward the colored race, by the side of which the allegations on\r\n  the impeachment of Andrew Johnson were technical and trivial.\r\n  Unquestionably President Grant deserved impeachment for high crimes\r\n  and misdemeanors, rather than a renomination; and on the trial it\r\n  would have been enough to exhibit his seizure of the war powers,\r\n  and his indignity to the Black Republic with its population of six\r\n  hundred thousand, in violation of the National Constitution and of\r\n  International Law. And here a contrast arises between him and Abraham\r\n  Lincoln. The latter in his first Annual Message recommended the\r\n  recognition of what he called “the independence and sovereignty of\r\n  Hayti”; but it is at these that President Grant has struck. One of\r\n  Abraham Lincoln’s earliest acts was to put the Black Republic on an\r\n  equality with other powers; one of President Grant’s earliest acts\r\n  was to degrade it.\r\n\r\n  I am so much of a Republican that I wish to see in the Presidential\r\n  chair a life-time Abolitionist. I also wish a President sincerely\r\n  devoted to Civil-Service Reform, beginning with the “One-Term\r\n  Principle,” which President Grant once accepted, but now disowns. I\r\n  also wish a President who sets the example of industry and unselfish\r\n  dedication to the public good. And I wish to see a President through\r\n  whom we may expect peace and harmony, instead of discord. Strangely,\r\n  President Grant seems to delight in strife. If he finds no enemy, he\r\n  falls upon his friends,--as when he struck at the Black Republic,\r\n  insulted Russia in his last Annual Message, offended both France and\r\n  Germany, and then, in personal relations, quarrelled generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PRINCIPLES ABOVE PARTY.\r\n\r\n  My own personal experience teaches how futile is the charge, that,\r\n  because Horace Greeley receives Democratic votes, therefore he\r\n  becomes a Democrat, or lapses under Democratic control. I was first\r\n  chosen to the Senate by a coalition of Free-Soilers and Democrats.\r\n  Democratic votes helped make me Senator from Massachusetts,--as they\r\n  also helped make my excellent friend Mr. Chase Senator from Ohio,\r\n  and will help make Horace Greeley President. But neither Mr. Chase\r\n  nor myself was on this account less faithful as a Free-Soiler,--and,\r\n  answering for myself, I know that I never became a Democrat or\r\n  lapsed under Democratic control. I do not doubt that Horace\r\n  Greeley will be equally consistent. The charge to the contrary, so\r\n  vehemently repeated, seems to reflect the character of those who make\r\n  it,--except that many repeat it by rote.\r\n\r\n  There is a common saying, “Principles, not Men”; and on this ground\r\n  an appeal is made for President Grant, it being justly felt that\r\n  in any personal comparison with Horace Greeley he must fail. But a\r\n  better saying is, “Principles _and_ Men.” I am for the principles of\r\n  the Republican Party in contradiction to Grantism, and I am for the\r\n  man who truly represents them. By these principles I shall stand,\r\n  for them I shall labor, and in their triumph I shall always rejoice.\r\n  If any valued friend separates from me now, it will be because he\r\n  _places a man above principles_. Early in public life I declared my\r\n  little heed for party, and my indifference to the name by which I was\r\n  called; and now I confess my want of sympathy with those who would\r\n  cling to the form after its spirit has fled.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GREELEY’S NOMINATION A RESPONSE TO LONGING FOR PEACE.\r\n\r\n  This answer would be incomplete, if I did not call attention to\r\n  another and controlling consideration, which cannot be neglected\r\n  by the good citizen. Watching the remarkable movement that has\r\n  ended in the double nomination of Horace Greeley, it is easy to see\r\n  that it did not proceed from politicians, whether at Cincinnati or\r\n  Baltimore. Evidently it was the heart of the people, sorely wrung by\r\n  war and the controversies it engendered, which found this expression.\r\n  Sir Philip Sidney said of the uprising in the Netherlands, “It is\r\n  the spirit of the Lord, and is irresistible”; and such a spirit is\r\n  manifest now. I would not use the word lightly, but to my mind it\r\n  is Providential. Notwithstanding the counteracting influence of\r\n  politicians, Republican and Democratic, in the face of persistent\r\n  ridicule, and against the extravagance of unscrupulous opposition,\r\n  the nomination at Cincinnati was triumphantly adopted at Baltimore.\r\n  Such an unprecedented victory, without concert or propulsion of\r\n  any kind, can be explained only by supposing that it is in harmony\r\n  with a popular longing. That Democrats, and especially those of the\r\n  South, should adopt a life-time Abolitionist for President is an\r\n  assurance of willingness to associate the rights of their colored\r\n  fellow-citizens with that Reconciliation of which Horace Greeley was\r\n  an early representative. In standing by Jefferson Davis at his trial\r\n  and signing his bail-bond, he showed the same sentiment of humanity\r\n  he so constantly displayed in standing by the colored race throughout\r\n  their prolonged trial; so that the two discordant races find kindred\r\n  hospitality in him, and he thus becomes a tie of union. In harmony\r\n  with this interesting circumstance is the assurance in his letter of\r\n  acceptance, that, if elected, he will be “the President, not of a\r\n  party, but of the whole people.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  RECONCILIATION.\r\n\r\n  The nomination has been adopted by the Democrats in convention\r\n  assembled. This was an event which the supporters of President Grant\r\n  declared impossible. I do not see how it can be regarded otherwise\r\n  than as a peace-offering. As such it is of infinite value. The Past\r\n  is rejected, and a new Future is begun with the promise of concord.\r\n  Here is no ordinary incident. It is a Revolution, and its success\r\n  in pacifying the country will be in proportion to its acceptance\r\n  by us. I dare not neglect the great opportunity, nor can I stand\r\n  aloof. It is in harmony with my life, which places Peace above all\r\n  things except the Rights of Man. Thus far, in constant efforts for\r\n  the colored race, I have sincerely sought the good of all, which I\r\n  was sure would be best obtained in fulfilling the promises of the\r\n  Declaration of Independence, making all equal in rights. The spirit\r\n  in which I acted appears in an early speech, where I said: “Nothing\r\n  in hate; nothing in vengeance.”[176] My object was security for Human\r\n  Rights. Most anxiously I have looked for the time, which seems now at\r\n  hand, when there should be reconciliation, not only between the North\r\n  and South, but between the two races, so that the two sections and\r\n  the two races may be lifted from the ruts and grooves in which they\r\n  are now fastened, and, instead of _irritating antagonism_ without\r\n  end, there shall be _sympathetic coöperation_.\r\n\r\n  The existing differences ought to be ended. There is a time for all\r\n  things, and we are admonished by a wide-spread popular uprising,\r\n  bursting the bonds of party, that the time has come for estrangement\r\n  to cease between people who by the ordinance of God must live\r\n  together. Gladly do I welcome the happy signs; nor can I observe\r\n  without regret the colored people in organized masses resisting the\r\n  friendly overtures, even to the extent of intimidating those who are\r\n  the other way. It is for them to consider carefully whether they\r\n  should not take advantage of the unexpected opening, and recognize\r\n  the “bail-bond” given at Baltimore as the assurance of peace, and\r\n  unite with me in holding the parties to the full performance of its\r\n  conditions. Provided always that their rights are fixed, I am sure it\r\n  cannot be best for the colored people to band together in a hostile\r\n  camp, provoking antagonism and keeping alive the separation of races.\r\n  Above all, there must be no intimidation; but every voter must act\r\n  freely, without constraint from league or lodge. Much better will\r\n  it be when the two political parties compete for your votes, each\r\n  anxious for your support. Only then will that citizenship by which\r\n  you are entitled to the equal rights of all have its natural fruits.\r\n  Only then will there be that harmony which is essential to a true\r\n  civilization.\r\n\r\n  The present position of the colored citizen is perilous. He is\r\n  exposed to injurious pressure where he needs support. But I see no\r\n  early extrication except in the way now proposed. Let him cut adrift\r\n  from managers who would wield him merely as a political force, with\r\n  little regard to his own good, and bravely stand by the candidate\r\n  who has stood by him. If Democrats unite with him, so much the\r\n  better. The association, once begun, must naturally ripen in common\r\n  friendship and trust.\r\n\r\n  I am for peace in reality as in name. From the bottom of my heart I\r\n  am for peace, and I welcome all that makes for peace. With deep-felt\r\n  satisfaction I remember that no citizen who drew his sword against\r\n  us has suffered by the hand of the executioner. In just association\r\n  with this humanity will be the triumph of Equal Rights, when the\r\n  promises of the great Declaration are all fulfilled, and our people\r\n  are united, as never before, in the enduring fellowship of a common\r\n  citizenship. To this end there must be Reconciliation. Nor can I\r\n  withhold my hand. Freely I accept the hand that is offered, and reach\r\n  forth my own in friendly grasp. I am against the policy of hate; I\r\n  am against fanning ancient flames into continued life; I am against\r\n  raking the ashes of the Past for coals of fire yet burning. Pile up\r\n  the ashes; extinguish the flames; abolish the hate!\r\n\r\n  And now, turning to the Democratic party, I hold it to all the\r\n  covenants solemnly given in the adoption of a Republican platform\r\n  with Horace Greeley as candidate. There can be no backward step.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WATCHWORD FOR THE CANVASS.\r\n\r\n  With no common sympathy I observe that Mr. Hendricks, a leading\r\n  Democrat, whom I knew and esteemed in the Senate, has recently\r\n  announced his acceptance of the Constitutional Amendments with their\r\n  logical results. He proposes, as a proper key-note to the popular\r\n  movement now swelling to a sure triumph, “Just Laws and Public\r\n  Virtue.” This is a worthy aspiration, entirely fit for the occasion.\r\n  My watchword is, “The Unity of the Republic, and the Equal Rights of\r\n  All, with Reconciliation.” Such is my heart-felt cry; and wherever\r\n  my voice can reach, there do I insist upon all these, humbly\r\n  invoking the blessings of Divine Providence, which, I believe, must\r\n  descend upon such a cause.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Accept my best wishes for yourselves personally, and for the people\r\n  you represent.\r\n\r\n      And believe me, Gentlemen,\r\n\r\n          Your faithful friend,\r\n\r\n              CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  To Dr. AUGUSTA, WILLIAM H. A. WORMLEY, and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER TO SPEAKER BLAINE.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 5, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n    July 31, 1872, Mr. Blaine addressed a letter to Mr. Sumner\r\n    through the newspapers, arraigning him as recreant both to party\r\n    and principle, in the position taken by him on the Presidential\r\n    question in his recent Letter to Colored Citizens. Mr. Sumner\r\n    responded as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                            WASHINGTON, August 5, 1872.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,--I have seen the letter addressed to me by you through the\r\n  public prints, and I notice especially, that, while animadverting\r\n  upon my support of Horace Greeley, you say not one word in\r\n  vindication of that compound of pretensions known as Grantism in\r\n  contradistinction to Republicanism, which you would install anew in\r\n  the Government.\r\n\r\n  You are greatly concerned about the company I keep. To quiet your\r\n  solicitude, I beg leave to say, that, in joining the Republicans\r\n  who brought forward an original Abolitionist, I find myself with so\r\n  many others devoted to the cause I have always served that I had not\r\n  missed you until you hastened to report absence; nor had I taken\r\n  account of the “Southern Secessionists,” who, as you aver, are now\r\n  coöperating with me in support of this original Abolitionist, except\r\n  to rejoice, that, if among former associates some like yourself\r\n  hesitate, their places are supplied from an unexpected quarter.\r\n\r\n  You entirely misunderstand me when you introduce an incident of\r\n  the past, and build on it an argument why I should not support\r\n  Horace Greeley. What has Preston Brooks to do with the Presidential\r\n  election? Never, while a sufferer, did anybody hear me speak of\r\n  him in unkindness; and now, after the lapse of more than half a\r\n  generation, I will not unite with you in dragging him from the\r\n  grave, where he sleeps, to aggravate the passions of a political\r\n  conflict, and arrest the longing for concord. And here is the\r\n  essential difference between you and me at this juncture. I seize the\r\n  opportunity to make the equal rights of all secure through peace and\r\n  reconciliation; but this infinite boon you would postpone.\r\n\r\n  Seven years have passed since the close of our Civil War; but,\r\n  unhappily, during all this period a hostile spirit has continued to\r\n  exist between the contending sections, while the rights of colored\r\n  fellow-citizens have been in perpetual question. Seven years mark a\r\n  natural period of human life. Should not the spirit be changed with\r\n  the body? Can we not after seven years begin a new life, especially\r\n  when those once our foes repeat the saying, “Thy people shall be my\r\n  people, and thy God my God”?\r\n\r\n  I declare my preference for an original Abolitionist as President,\r\n  and you seek to create a diversion by crying out that Democrats will\r\n  support him. To which I reply, So much the better. Their support is\r\n  the assurance that the cause he has so constantly guarded, whether of\r\n  Equal Rights or Reconciliation, is accepted by Democrats; and this is\r\n  the pledge of a true union beyond anything in our history. It is a\r\n  victory of ideas, without which all other victories must fail.\r\n\r\n  To intensify your allegation, you insist that I am ranged with\r\n  Jefferson Davis and Robert Toombs; but, pardon me, nobody knows how\r\n  the former will vote, while Robert Toombs is boisterous against\r\n  Horace Greeley, and with him are Stephens, Wise, and Mosby. This is\r\n  all very poor, and I mention it only to exhibit the character of your\r\n  attempt.\r\n\r\n  In the same spirit you seek to avoid the real issue by holding\r\n  up the possibility of what you call a Democratic Administration;\r\n  and you have the courage to assert, as within my knowledge, that\r\n  by the election of Horace Greeley “Congress is handed over to the\r\n  control of the party who have persistently denied the rights of the\r\n  black man.” You say that I know this. Mr. Speaker, I know no such\r\n  thing, and you should be sufficiently thoughtful not to assert it.\r\n  I am entirely satisfied that a canvass like the present, where the\r\n  principles declared at Cincinnati are openly accepted on one side\r\n  and not contested on the other, must result in a larger number of\r\n  Congressional Representatives sincerely devoted to the rights of the\r\n  colored citizen than ever before.\r\n\r\n  The Democrats will be pledged, as never before, to the ruling\r\n  principle that All Men are Equal before the Law, and also to the\r\n  three Constitutional Amendments, with the clause in each empowering\r\n  Congress to enforce the same by appropriate legislation. But besides\r\n  Democrats, there will be Liberal Republicans pledged likewise, and\r\n  also your peculiar associates, who, I trust, will not betray the\r\n  cause. Senators and Representatives calling themselves Republicans\r\n  have been latterly in large majority in both Houses; but the final\r\n  measure of Civil Rights, to which you refer, though urged by\r\n  me almost daily, has failed to become a law, less, I fear, from\r\n  Democratic opposition than from Republican lukewarmness and the want\r\n  of support in the President.\r\n\r\n  The great issue which the people are called to decide in November\r\n  is on the President, and nobody knows better than yourself that the\r\n  House of Representatives, chosen at the same time, will naturally\r\n  harmonize with him. So it has been in our history. Now harmony with\r\n  Horace Greeley involves what I most desire. With such a President,\r\n  Congress will be changed. For the first time since the war the Equal\r\n  Rights of All will have a declared representative at the head of the\r\n  Government, whose presence there will be of higher significance than\r\n  that of any victor in war, being not only a testimony, but a constant\r\n  motive-power in this great cause.\r\n\r\n  Opposition, whether open hostility or more subtle treachery, will\r\n  yield to the steady influence of such a representative. Therefore in\r\n  looking to the President I look also to Congress, which will take its\r\n  character in large measure from him. In choosing Horace Greeley we do\r\n  the best we can for the whole Government,--not only in the Executive,\r\n  but in the Legislative branch,--while we decline to support nepotism,\r\n  repayment of personal gifts by official patronage, seizure of the\r\n  war powers, indignity to the Black Republic,--also, the various\r\n  incapacity exhibited by the President, and the rings by which he\r\n  governs,--none of which can you defend. You know well that the rings\r\n  are already condemned by the American people.\r\n\r\n  For myself, I say plainly and without hesitation, that I prefer\r\n  Horace Greeley, with any Congress possible on the Cincinnati\r\n  Platform, to President Grant, _with his personal government and\r\n  his rings_,--a vote for whom involves the support of this personal\r\n  government, _with prolonged power in all the rings_. There must be\r\n  another influence and another example. The Administration, in all its\r\n  parts, is impressed by the President. Let his soul be enlarged with\r\n  the sentiment of justice, quickened by industry, and not only the two\r\n  Houses of Congress, but the whole country, will feel the irresistible\r\n  authority, overspreading, pervading, permeating everywhere.\r\n  Therefore, in proportion as you are earnest for the rights of the\r\n  colored citizen, and place them above all partisan triumph, you will\r\n  be glad to support the candidate whose heart has always throbbed for\r\n  Humanity. The country needs such a motive-power in the White House;\r\n  it needs a generous fountain there. In one word, it needs somebody\r\n  different from the present incumbent; and nobody knows this better\r\n  than Speaker Blaine.\r\n\r\n  The personal imputation you make upon me I repel with the indignation\r\n  of an honest man. I was a faithful supporter of the President until\r\n  somewhat tardily awakened by his painful conduct on the island of\r\n  San Domingo, involving seizure of the war power in violation of the\r\n  Constitution, and indignity to the Black Republic in violation of\r\n  International Law; and when I remonstrated against these intolerable\r\n  outrages, I was set upon by those acting in his behalf. Such is the\r\n  origin of my opposition. I could not have done less without failure\r\n  in that duty which is with me the rule of life. Nor can I doubt\r\n  that when partisan sentiments are less active you will regret the\r\n  wrong you have done me. Meanwhile I appeal confidently to the candid\r\n  judgment of those who, amidst all present differences of opinion,\r\n  unite in the great objects, far above Party or President, to which my\r\n  life is devoted.\r\n\r\n      I am, Sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  THE HONORABLE SPEAKER BLAINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRETROSPECT AND PROMISE.\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT A SERENADE BEFORE HIS HOUSE IN WASHINGTON, AUGUST 9, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The serenade was given under the auspices of the colored men of\r\n    the District, on the occasion of the Senator’s departure for\r\n    Boston,--and the crowd in attendance is reported to have been “one\r\n    of the largest ever gathered in Washington for a similar object.”\r\n    On presentation by Dr. Augusta as “the tried and true friend of the\r\n    African race,” Mr. Sumner said:--\r\n\r\nFRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS:--\r\n\r\nI am touched by this voluntary expression of friendship, and beg to\r\nthank you from the heart.\r\n\r\nIn seeing you on this occasion I think of you only as personal\r\nfriends among whom I have lived more than twenty years. During this\r\nconsiderable period changes have occurred of incalculable importance\r\nto the country, but especially to the colored people. When I entered\r\nupon my public duties here Slavery was in the ascendant, giving the law\r\nto all the usages of life. The colored man was degraded. He was not\r\nallowed to testify in court; he was shut out from the public schools;\r\nhe was excluded from the public conveyances, and thrust away from the\r\nballot-box. But here in the National Capital all these terrible wrongs\r\nhave ceased. The court-room, the school-house, the horse-car, and the\r\nballot-box are all open, never to be closed. Revolutions do not go\r\nbackward. Therefore you may rest secure in what has been won. Of this\r\nbe sure, Slavery will never be revived, nor will you be restrained or\r\nlimited in any of these rights you now enjoy. [_Applause, and three\r\ncheers for Mr. Sumner._]\r\n\r\nMost sincerely do I congratulate you on these signal triumphs, so\r\nlittle to be expected when I first became acquainted with you. And when\r\nwe consider the brief period in which they have been accomplished, I am\r\nsure you will unite with me in hope and trust for the future. [_Cries,\r\n“We will!”_]\r\n\r\nIt is my duty, however, to remind you that the work is not yet\r\ncompleted. This will be only by the enactment of a Civil Rights\r\nBill which shall relieve the citizen, whoever he may be, from any\r\nexclusion or discrimination on account of his color. Only then will be\r\nestablished that Equality before the Law to which now, for the first\r\ntime in our history, all political parties are distinctly pledged. Here\r\nthere can be no question. [_Applause._] It is in the platforms of all.\r\nOf the early passage of such a law I do not doubt. Then will you have\r\nall the assurance of your rights that can be found in the Constitution\r\nand law. But that law will be the cap-stone. [_Applause._]\r\n\r\nI shall not disguise from you that something more will be needed. There\r\nmust be a constant, watchful, public opinion behind, to see that these\r\nare enforced in letter and spirit. Here there must be no failure in\r\nawakening and invigorating this public opinion. You can do much,--I\r\nwould almost say you can do everything. How constantly have I urged,\r\nin public speech and in all my intercourse with you, that our colored\r\nfellow-citizens must insist upon their rights always, by petition, by\r\nspeech, and by vote! Above all, never vote for any man who is not true\r\nto you. Make allegiance to you the measure of your support. [_Cheers._]\r\nSo doing, all parties will seek your vote. [_Cheers._] You will be\r\nfelt, and your cause will be irresistible.\r\n\r\nPlease accept these few words as my acknowledgment of your kindness\r\nthis evening. [_Cries, “Go on!”_] From long acquaintance you know\r\nsomething of my sympathies. [_A voice, “I do!”_] Always from the\r\nbeginning I have sought to serve you, and always to the end shall I\r\nseek to serve you. To your cause my life is dedicated, and nothing can\r\nturn me from it, nothing can tempt me or drive me from its support.\r\n[_Loud applause._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFREDERICK DOUGLASS AND PRESIDENT GRANT.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO HON. ANDREW D. WHITE, PRESIDENT OF CORNELL UNIVERSITY, AUGUST\r\n10, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           WASHINGTON, August 10, 1872.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR,--I am surprised by a statement purporting to proceed\r\n  from you, which I find under the telegraphic head, to the effect that\r\n  I have misrepresented facts with regard to Frederick Douglass.\r\n\r\n  In making this allegation you defend the Commissioners to San\r\n  Domingo, and allege that Mr. Douglass was well treated by them.\r\n  I have never said the contrary, nor have I ever alluded to the\r\n  treatment he received from them. Not a word or hint can be found on\r\n  the subject in anything written or spoken by me.\r\n\r\n  My allusion was to the exclusion of Mr. Douglass from the common\r\n  table of the mail-packet on the Potomac, almost within sight of the\r\n  Executive Mansion, simply on account of color,--and I added, that the\r\n  President, on whose invitation he had joined the Commission, never\r\n  uttered a word in rebuke of this exclusion, and when entertaining\r\n  the returned Commissioners at dinner carefully omitted Mr. Douglass,\r\n  who was in Washington at the time, and thus repeated the indignity.\r\n  On this you are represented as remarking, that General Sigel was\r\n  also omitted, but that, in fact, Mr. Douglass and General Sigel had\r\n  already left for their homes (forgetting that Mr. Douglass continued\r\n  in Washington); and you do not allow yourself to doubt, that, had\r\n  they been in town, they would have been included in the invitation.\r\n  Your apology clearly shows your opinion that they ought to have\r\n  been invited; but please not to forget that there was a reason for\r\n  inviting Mr. Douglass that did not exist in the case of General\r\n  Sigel. The General was white, and he had suffered no indignity on\r\n  board a mail-packet which it was in the power of the President to\r\n  rebuke by example.\r\n\r\n  But you are mistaken in the facts, as appears by the newspapers of\r\n  the time. The Commissioners reached Washington on the evening of\r\n  March 27th. They were entertained at dinner by the President March\r\n  30th. On the day before the dinner Mr. Douglass presided at the\r\n  Convention to nominate a Delegate to Congress from the District of\r\n  Columbia, and on taking the chair made a speech. Mr. Chipman was\r\n  nominated against Mr. Douglass, who made another speech thanking his\r\n  supporters for their votes. To gratify the friends of Mr. Douglass,\r\n  there was an understanding that he should succeed Mr. Chipman as\r\n  Secretary of the District. These things show that Mr. Douglass was\r\n  not only in Washington, but conspicuously so, presiding at a public\r\n  Convention, and being voted for as a candidate for Congress.\r\n\r\n  But we are not left to inference. Mr. A. M. Green, of Washington, who\r\n  at the Convention nominated Mr. Douglass for Congress, assures us\r\n  that he did not leave town till some days later. Mr. Green further\r\n  states, in a note dated August 10th, now before me, that about\r\n  this time he and another friend called on Mr. Douglass, in relation\r\n  to his appointment by the President as Secretary of the District;\r\n  that Mr. Douglass, while thanking them for their earnestness in\r\n  his behalf, assured them that he had no hope of success; that he\r\n  had “new evidence of the conservative character or tendency of the\r\n  Administration, which warranted him in the opinion that we could not\r\n  succeed”; and Mr. Green says that Mr. Douglass added these words:\r\n  “I was not only neglected without any rebuke for the offence from\r\n  the President, but the Commissioners have been invited to dine with\r\n  the President, and the same spirit of neglect has been exhibited in\r\n  that respect also.” Mr. Green adds, that recently, while on the way\r\n  to the National Colored Convention at New Orleans, Mr. Douglass, in\r\n  conversation with Mr. Downing and himself, “referred in a complaining\r\n  spirit to this circumstance.”\r\n\r\n  I have also before me a note, dated August 10th, from Mr. Wormley, so\r\n  well known for his excellent hotel in Washington, who says that he\r\n  asked Mr. Douglass, shortly after his return, if he dined with the\r\n  President and the Commissioners, to which he answered, “No, and for\r\n  the good reason that I was not invited”; and then he added, “It is\r\n  no use to deny it, but I feel it sorely.” This was at Mr. Douglass’s\r\n  office. On another occasion, at his son’s house, referring to the\r\n  same thing, he said to Mr. Wormley, “I felt it keenly.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. Gray, recently of the Legislative Council of the District,\r\n  nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, now a School\r\n  Trustee, assures me that Mr. Douglass spoke to him of his omission\r\n  by the President with the same feeling that he exhibited to Mr.\r\n  Green and Mr. Wormley. These witnesses are all colored, but even\r\n  without the new law nobody would question their testimony. I add my\r\n  own acquaintance with the case. At my house, Mr. Douglass, while\r\n  speaking not unkindly, said that he felt the President’s neglect in\r\n  not inviting him to dine, which was more noticeable, as he had gone\r\n  to San Domingo at the express invitation of the President, and on his\r\n  return was insulted on board the Potomac mail-packet. He added, that\r\n  an invitation from the President would have been a proper rebuke to\r\n  those who had insulted him.\r\n\r\n  I will add, that it is a matter of common notoriety that Mr. Douglass\r\n  did not disguise his feelings on account of this Presidential\r\n  incident.\r\n\r\n  Such are the facts and the evidence. I think that you will see, my\r\n  dear Sir, that, if there is any misstatement, or, as you express it,\r\n  “perversion of facts,” it is not on my part.\r\n\r\n      Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREELEY OR GRANT?\r\n\r\nSPEECH INTENDED TO BE DELIVERED AT FANEUIL HALL, BOSTON, SEPTEMBER 3,\r\n1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LIBERAL REPUBLICAN HEAD-QUARTERS, BOSTON,\r\n                                                       August 24, 1872.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SIR,--I am directed by the Liberal Republican State\r\n    Committee to communicate to you a vote of which the following is a\r\n    copy:--\r\n\r\n        “_Voted_, That the Chairman, in the name of the Liberal\r\n        Republican State Committee, invite the Hon. Charles Sumner to\r\n        address his constituents on Public Affairs in Faneuil Hall, at\r\n        the earliest day that may suit his convenience.”\r\n\r\n    Allow me to add my earnest personal wishes that you will be able\r\n    to comply with the request. “The great soul of the world is just,”\r\n    and the sober second thought of the people of Massachusetts will, I\r\n    doubt not, sustain you in the position you have taken in favor of\r\n    Reform and Reconciliation, and therefore of the election of Greeley\r\n    and Brown.\r\n\r\n        Very faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n            F. W. BIRD.\r\n\r\n    HON. CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n                                               BOSTON, August 30, 1872.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,--I have been honored by your communication of August 24th,\r\n  inviting me in the name of the Liberal Republicans of Massachusetts,\r\n  to speak in Faneuil Hall. It is with inexpressible pain and regret\r\n  that I feel constrained to decline this flattering opportunity.\r\n\r\n  I had confidently hoped, on returning home, to meet my\r\n  fellow-citizens in that venerable forum, so dear to us all, and\r\n  to speak once more on great questions involving the welfare of\r\n  our country; but recurring symptoms of a painful character warn\r\n  me against any such attempt. My physician advises that I must not\r\n  for the present make any public effort, and he prescribes rest.\r\n  Valued friends, familiar with my condition, unite with the excellent\r\n  physician.\r\n\r\n  In submitting most reluctantly to these admonitions, I cannot\r\n  renounce the privilege of communicating with my fellow-citizens, and\r\n  therefore hand you a copy of what, with the blessing of health, I\r\n  hoped to say. In the House of Representatives undelivered speeches\r\n  are sometimes ordered to be printed. You may follow this precedent\r\n  with mine, or do with it as you please. Meanwhile accept my best\r\n  wishes, and believe me, dear Sir,\r\n\r\n      Very faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  HON. FRANCIS W. BIRD, Chairman, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS,--It is on the invitation of the State Committee of\r\nLiberal Republicans that I have the honor of addressing you. I shall\r\nspeak directly on the issue before us. If I am frank and plain, it will\r\nbe only according to my nature and the requirement of duty at this\r\ntime. But nothing can I say which is not prompted by a sincere desire\r\nto serve my country, and especially to promote that era of good-will,\r\nwhen the assent of all shall be assured to the equal rights of all.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWO CANDIDATES.\r\n\r\nAt the approaching Presidential Election the people are to choose\r\nbetween two candidates. By the operation of our electoral system,\r\nand the superadded dictation of National Conventions, the choice is\r\npractically limited to President Grant and Horace Greeley; so that no\r\npreference for another can be made effective. One of these must be\r\ntaken. Preferring Horace Greeley, I have no hesitation in assigning the\r\nreasons which lead me to this conclusion.\r\n\r\nBelieving the present incumbent unfit for the great office to which he\r\naspires for a second time, and not doubting that a vote for him would\r\nbe regarded as the sanction of abuses and pretensions unrepublican\r\nin character, I early saw the difficulty of taking any part for his\r\nreëlection. Long ago I declared, that, while recognizing party as an\r\nessential agency and convenience, I could not allow it to constrain\r\nmy conscience against what seemed the requirements of public good.\r\nRegarding always substance rather than form, I have been indifferent to\r\nthe name by which I might be called. Nor was I impressed by the way in\r\nwhich the candidate was urged. Supporters, while admitting his failure,\r\nand even the abuses and pretensions so notorious in his civil life,\r\ncommended his reëlection as necessary to uphold the party with which\r\nI have been associated. But it is easy to see that a vote for such a\r\ncandidate on such a reason was “to do evil that good might come,” which\r\nis forbidden in politics as in morals.\r\n\r\nTwo courses seemed open. One was to abstain from voting,--and I confess\r\nthat this was my first inclination. But it is not easy for me to be\r\nneutral,--certainly where wrong-doing is in question; nor is it my\r\nhabit to shrink from responsibility. But the doubt that beset me was\r\nremoved when I saw the Democratic Party adopt the candidate opposed\r\nto President Grant, being an original Republican already nominated by\r\na Republican Convention, and at the same time accept the Republican\r\nplatform on which he was nominated. An old party, which had long stood\r\nout against the Republican cause, now placed itself on a Republican\r\nplatform, the best ever adopted, with a Republican candidate, who was\r\nthe most devoted Republican ever nominated,--thus completely accepting\r\nthe results of the war, and offering the hand of reconciliation. At\r\nonce the character of the contest changed. This was no common event.\r\nPardon me, if I say that to me it was of peculiar interest. For years\r\nI have sought to establish in the National Government the great\r\nprinciples of the Declaration of Independence, avowing always that when\r\nthis was done nobody should surpass me in generosity towards former\r\nRebels. Not only by the logic of my life, but by constant speeches,\r\nwas I bound to welcome those who placed themselves on this glorious\r\nplatform. The extent of this obligation will appear before I close. And\r\nnow its performance harmonizes with opposition to the prolonged misrule\r\nof the present incumbent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO REASONS IN FAVOR OF GREELEY.\r\n\r\nEvidently I am not at liberty to abstain from voting. In considering\r\nthe reasons in favor of Horace Greeley, I find two, differing in\r\ncharacter, but of chief importance: first, that he represents a\r\nreformed civil service, beginning with the One-Term principle, without\r\nwhich this reform is too much like a sham; and, secondly, that he\r\nrepresents reconciliation, not only between the two sections, but\r\nbetween the two races, which is essential to the repose of the country\r\nand the safeguard of Equal Rights.\r\n\r\nTo these must be added, that he does not represent those personal\r\npretensions, so utterly inconsistent with Republican government, which\r\nare now known as Grantism. In voting for Horace Greeley you will not\r\nsustain nepotism, you will not sustain gift-taking and repayment by\r\nofficial favor, and you will not lend your sanction to the San Domingo\r\nmachination, with its unconstitutional usurpations, its violations of\r\nInternational Law, and its indignity to the Black Republic. Elsewhere\r\nI have considered these fully,[177] and I am not aware of any answer to\r\nthe undeniable facts. I shall only glance at them now.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEPOTISM.\r\n\r\nNepotism is already condemned by history, and most justly; for it is\r\nobviously a form of self-seeking, hostile to purity of government,\r\nand strangely out of place in a Republic. Nothing for self, but\r\nall for country and mankind, should be the rule of our President.\r\nIf the promptings of his inner nature fail, then must he feel the\r\nirresistible obligation of his position. As he does, so will others\r\ndo; and therefore must his example be such as to elevate the public\r\nservice. Nothing in Washington’s career has shone with more constant\r\nlight than his refusal to confer office on his relations. Even at the\r\ntime, it arrested attention not only at home but abroad, landing praise\r\nin England. Of this there is a striking illustration. The “Register\r\nof the Times,” published at London in 1795, in an article entitled\r\n“Interesting and Authentic Documents respecting the United States of\r\nAmerica,” records its homage:--\r\n\r\n    “The execution of the office of the Chief Magistrate has been\r\n    attended through a term of four years with a circumstance which\r\n    to an admiring world requires no commentary. A native citizen of\r\n    the United States, transferred from private life to that station,\r\n    has not, during so long a term, appointed a single relation to any\r\n    office of honor or emolument.”[178]\r\n\r\nWith such confession an admiring world looked on. Something would I\r\ndo--something, I trust, the American people will do at the coming\r\nelection--to secure this beautiful praise yet again for our country.\r\n\r\n\r\nGIFT-TAKING.\r\n\r\nLike nepotism, the taking of gifts by a public servant is condemned\r\nby history. No honest nature can uphold it. How well did our late\r\nGeneral Thomas, so admirable in character, rebuke this abuse, when he\r\nreplied to an offer of $100,000, as I am told, “Let it go to my men”!\r\nIf not a form of bribery, it is kindred in nature,--and this has long\r\nbeen recognized, from the Bible down to our day. According to the old\r\nscriptures it is destructive: “The king by judgment stablisheth the\r\nland; but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it.”[179] Here again\r\nis the example of Washington brightly lighting the true republican\r\npathway. The same President who would not appoint a relation would\r\nnot take a gift, even when out of office. His example was in harmony\r\nwith the lesson of Colonial days. As long ago as April 20, 1703, Queen\r\nAnne, in a communication to Lord Cornbury, Governor of New York and\r\nNew Jersey, laid down the following rule: that neither the Governor,\r\nLieutenant-Governor, Commander-in-Chief, or President of the Council\r\n“do receive any gift or present from the Assembly _or others_ on\r\nany account or in any manner whatsoever, upon pain of our highest\r\ndispleasure, and of being recalled from that our Government.”[180] This\r\nrule is as good for our day as for that in which it was ordained by\r\nroyal authority.\r\n\r\nThere is another instance, which should not be forgotten. It is that\r\nof Lord Wellesley, the accomplished brother of the Duke of Wellington.\r\nA work so common as that of Smiles on “Self-Help” records, that, while\r\nGovernor-General of India, he positively refused a present of £100,000\r\nfrom the Directors of the East India Company on the conquest of Mysore;\r\nand here the terms of his refusal are important:--\r\n\r\n    “It is not necessary for me to allude to the independence of my\r\n    character and the proper dignity attaching to my office; other\r\n    reasons besides these important considerations lead me to decline\r\n    this testimony, which is not suitable to me. I think of nothing but\r\n    our army. I should be much distressed to curtail the share of those\r\n    brave soldiers.”[181]\r\n\r\nHis refusal remained unalterable. At a later period, when nearly\r\neighty years of age, embarrassed by debts, and entirely withdrawn from\r\npublic life, he allowed the Company to vote him a much smaller sum in\r\nconsideration of his signal services.[182]\r\n\r\n\r\nGIFT-MAKERS APPOINTED TO OFFICE.\r\n\r\nThe allowances voted by Parliament to Marlborough and Wellington on\r\naccount of their victories can be no precedent for the acceptance\r\nof gifts from fellow-citizens. The distinction is clear. But the\r\ncase against the present incumbent is not only that while holding\r\nhigh office he accepted gifts from fellow-citizens, but subsequently\r\nappointed the gift-makers to office,--thus using the Presidency to pay\r\noff his own personal obligations. Please bear this in mind; and when\r\nsome apologist attempts to defend the taking of gifts, let him know\r\nthat he must go still further, and show that the Presidency, with all\r\nits patronage, is a perquisite to be employed for the private advantage\r\nof the incumbent.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAN DOMINGO.\r\n\r\nNext in illustration of the prevailing misrule is the San Domingo\r\nbusiness, with its eccentricities of wrong-doing; and this, too, is\r\nnow in issue. At the thought of this unprecedented enormity, where\r\nwrong assumes such various forms, it is hard to be silent; but I shall\r\nbe brief. The case is clear, and stands on documents which cannot be\r\nquestioned. I keep within the line of moderate statement, when I say,\r\nthat, from the beginning of our Government, nothing in our foreign\r\nrelations has been so absolutely indefensible. It will not do to call\r\nit simply a fault and an insolence; it was an elaborate contrivance,\r\nconceived in lust of territory, pursued in ignorance, maintained\r\nin open violation of the National Constitution, pushed forward in\r\nsimilar violation of International Law in fundamental principles, and\r\ncrowned by intolerable indignity to the Black Republic, even to the\r\nextent of menacing hostilities and the sinking of its ships,--all\r\nwithout authority of Congress, and by Presidential prerogative alone.\r\nIn this drama the President, like a favorite actor, assumed every\r\npart. In negotiating the treaty he was President; in declaring war\r\nhe was Congress; in sending ships and men he was Commander-in-Chief;\r\nand then in employing private influence with Senators to promote his\r\nscheme--according to the promise in the protocol with Baez, signed in\r\nhis name by Orville E. Babcock, entitled therein “Aide-de-Camp to his\r\nExcellency General Ulysses S. Grant, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica”--he was lobbyist. That such things can be done by a President\r\nwithout indignant condemnation, loud and universal, shows a painful\r\ndemoralization in the country. That their author can be presented for\r\nreëlection to the Presidency, whose powers he has thus misused, shows a\r\ndisheartening insensibility to public virtue.\r\n\r\nHere I remark, that, so long as the President confined himself to\r\nnegotiation, he was strictly within the line of the Constitution.\r\nEven if indiscreet in character and impolitic in object, it was not\r\nunconstitutional. But in seizing war powers without the authority of\r\nCongress, in upholding the usurper Baez that he might sell his country,\r\nin menacing the Black Republic, and then in playing the lobbyist to\r\npromote the contrivance, the President did what no other President\r\never did before, and what, for the sake of Republican Institutions,\r\nshould be rebuked by the American people. It was the knowledge of these\r\nproceedings that changed essentially my relations to the question.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONAL MISREPRESENTATIONS.\r\n\r\nI allude with hesitation to personal misrepresentations on the matter.\r\nIt has been said that I promised originally to support the treaty.\r\nThis is a mistake. I knew nothing of the treaty, and had no suspicion\r\nof it, until several months after the protocol, and some time after\r\nthe negotiation was completed; and then my simple promise was that it\r\nshould have from me “the most careful and candid consideration”; and\r\nsuch I gave it most sincerely. At first my opposition was reserved\r\nand without allusion to the President. It was only when the strange\r\nbusiness was fully disclosed in official documents communicated in\r\nconfidence to the Senate, and it was still pressed, that I felt\r\nimpelled to a sterner resistance. Especially was I constrained, when I\r\nfound how much the people of Hayti suffered. It so happened that I had\r\nreported the bill acknowledging their independence and establishing\r\ndiplomatic relations between our two countries, assuring that equality\r\nwhich had been violated. Not unmoved could I witness the wrong\r\ninflicted upon them. And has it come to this, that the President of the\r\nGreat Republic, instead of carrying peace and good tidings to Africans\r\ncommencing the experiment of self-government, should become to them an\r\nagent of terror?\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to see how I could have done otherwise. Anxious to\r\nexcuse the anger towards me, it has been said that I opposed the treaty\r\nbecause Mr. Motley was unceremoniously removed from the mission at\r\nLondon; and here you will see the extent to which misrepresentation has\r\ngone. It so happens that Mr. Motley was removed on the day immediately\r\nfollowing the rejection of the treaty. Evidently my opposition was not\r\ninfluenced by the removal: was the removal influenced by my opposition?\r\n\r\nEqually absurd is the story that I am now influenced by personal\r\nfeelings. I am a public servant, trained to duty; and now, as always\r\nbefore, I have yielded only to this irresistible mandate. With me\r\nthere is no alternative. The misconduct of the President, so apparent\r\nin the San Domingo device, became more conspicuous in the light of\r\nillustrative facts, showing it to be part of a prevailing misrule,\r\nwhich, for the sake of our country, should not be prolonged. As a\r\npatriot citizen, anxious for the national welfare and renown, am I\r\nobliged to declare these convictions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am now brought to those two chief measures to be advanced by the\r\nelection of Horace Greeley, each of controlling importance,--one\r\nlooking directly to purity and efficiency in the government, and the\r\nother to the peace and welfare of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE-TERM PRINCIPLE.\r\n\r\nThe principle of One Term for President is the corner-stone of a\r\nreformed civil service. So plain is this to my apprehension, that I am\r\nat a loss to understand how any one sincerely in favor of such reform\r\ncan fail to insist upon this principle. All experience shows that the\r\nemployment of the appointing power to promote the personal ends of\r\nthe President is the great disturbing influence in our civil service.\r\nHere is the comprehensive abuse which envelops all the offices of the\r\ncountry, making them tributary to one man, and subordinate to his\r\ndesires. Let this be changed, and you have the first stage of reform,\r\nwithout which all other measures are dilatory, if not feeble and\r\ninefficient. How futile to recommend, as is done by the Commissioners\r\non Civil Service, “an honest competitive examination,” while the rules\r\nfor this system are left to the discretion of a President seeking\r\nreëlection! “Lead us not into temptation” is part of the brief prayer\r\nwe are all taught to repeat; nor are Presidents above the necessity of\r\nthis prayer. The misuse of the appointing power to advance ambitious\r\naims is a temptation to which a President must not be exposed. For his\r\nsake, and for the sake of the country, this must not be.\r\n\r\nIn attributing peril to this influence, I speak not only from my own\r\ncareful observation, but from the testimony of others whose words are\r\nauthoritative. You do not forget how Andrew Jackson declared that\r\nthe limitation of the office to one term was required, in order to\r\nplace the President “beyond the reach of any improper influences” and\r\n“uncommitted to any other course than the strict line of constitutional\r\nduty,”[183]--how William Henry Harrison announced, that, with the\r\nadoption of this principle, “the incumbent would devote all his time\r\nto the public interest, and there would be no cause to misrule the\r\ncountry,”[184]--how Henry Clay was satisfied, after much observation\r\nand reflection, “that too much of the time, the thoughts, and the\r\nexertions of the incumbent are occupied during his first term in\r\nsecuring his reëlection,”[185]--and how my senatorial associate of\r\nmany years, Benjamin F. Wade, after denouncing the reëligibility of\r\nthe President, said, “There are defects in the Constitution, and\r\nthis is among the most glaring.”[186] According to this experienced\r\nSenator, the reëligibility of the President is not only a defect in the\r\nConstitution, but one of its most glaring defects.\r\n\r\nAnd such also was the declared opinion of the present incumbent before\r\nhis election and the temptation of a second term. It has been stated\r\nby one who conferred with him at the time, that immediately before\r\nhis nomination General Grant said, in the spirit of Andrew Jackson,\r\n“The liberties of the country cannot be maintained without a One-Term\r\nAmendment of the Constitution”; and another writes me, that while on\r\na walk between the White House and the Treasury, just at the head of\r\nthe steps, near the fountain, the General paused a moment, and said,\r\n“I am in favor of restricting the President to a single term, and of\r\nabolishing the office of Vice-President.” By the authority of this\r\ndeclaration, the “Morning Chronicle,”[187] the organ of the Republican\r\nparty at Washington, proclaimed of its Presidential candidate, “He is,\r\nmoreover, an advocate of the One-Term principle, as conducing toward\r\nthe proper administration of the law”; and then at a later date,[188]\r\nafter calling for the adoption of this principle, the same Republican\r\norgan said, “General Grant is in favor of it.” Unquestionably at\r\nthat time, while the canvass was proceeding, he allowed himself to\r\nbe commended as a supporter of this principle. That he should now\r\ndisregard it gives new reason for the prayer, “Lead us not into\r\ntemptation.”\r\n\r\nNever before was the necessity for this beneficent Amendment more\r\napparent; for never before was the wide-spread abuse from the\r\nreëligibility of the President more grievously conspicuous. De\r\nTocqueville, the illustrious Frenchman, who saw our institutions with a\r\nvision quickened by genius and chastened by friendly regard, discerned\r\nthe peril, when he said:--\r\n\r\n     “Intrigue and corruption are the natural vices of elective\r\n    government; but when the head of the State can be reëlected, these\r\n    evils rise to a great height and compromise the very existence of\r\n    the country. When a simple candidate seeks to rise by intrigue,\r\n    his manœuvres must be limited to a very narrow sphere; _but when\r\n    the Chief Magistrate enters the lists, he borrows the strength of\r\n    the Government for his own purposes_.… If the representative of\r\n    the Executive descends into the combat, the cares of Government\r\n    dwindle for him into second-rate importance, and the success of his\r\n    election is his first concern.”[189]\r\n\r\nNothing can be more true than these remarkable words, which are\r\ncompletely verified in what we now behold. The whole diversified\r\nmachinery of the National Government in all its parts, operating in\r\nState, District, Town, and Village, is now at work to secure the\r\nreëlection of the President, as for some time before it worked to\r\nsecure his renomination,--the whole being obedient to the central touch.\r\n\r\nLook for a moment at this machinery, or, if you please, at this\r\npolitical hierarchy, beginning with Cabinet officers, and reaching\r\nto the pettiest postmaster, every one diligent to the single end of\r\nserving Presidential aspiration. The Jeffersonian rule was, “Is he\r\nhonest? Is he capable? Is he faithful to the Constitution?” But this\r\nis now lost in the mightier law, “Is he faithful to reëlection?”\r\nThis failing, all merit fails. Every office-holder, from highest to\r\nlowest, according to his influence, becomes propagandist, fugleman,\r\nwhipper-in. Members of the Cabinet set the example, and perambulate\r\nthe country, instructing the people to vote for reëlection. Heads of\r\nBureaus do likewise. Then, in their respective localities, officers of\r\nthe Customs, officers of the Internal Revenue, marshals with their\r\ndeputies, and postmasters, each and all, inspired from the National\r\nCapitol, are all calling for reëlection. This organized power,\r\nvariously estimated at from sixty to eighty thousand in number, all\r\npaid by the Government, and overspreading the whole country in one\r\nminute network, has unprecedented control at this moment, partly from\r\nincreased facilities of communication, and partly from the military\r\ndrill which still survives the war, but more, perhaps, from the\r\ndetermined will of the President, to which all these multitudinous\r\nwills are subjugated. This simple picture, which nobody can question,\r\nreveals a tyranny second only to that of the Slave Power itself,--which\r\nJefferson seems to have foreseen, when, after portraying the\r\nLegislature as most to be feared in his day, he said, “The tyranny of\r\nthe Executive will come in its turn.”[190] Even his prophetic vision\r\ndid not enable him to foresee the mournful condition we now deplore,\r\nwith the One-Man Power lording itself through all the offices of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe recent election in North Carolina made this practically manifest.\r\nEven without a telescope, all could discern the operations of the\r\nfield. Postmasters and officers of Internal Revenue were on hand,\r\neach in his place; then came the Marshal, with files of deputies,\r\nextemporized for the occasion; while, ranging over the extensive\r\ncircuit, was the Supervisor of the Revenue; the whole instructed and\r\nanimated by members of the Cabinet, who abandoned their responsible\r\nduties to help reëlection, which for the time was above all departments\r\nof Government and all exigencies of the public service. In the same way\r\nthe chief Custom-Houses of the country have been enlisted. Each has\r\nbecome a political centre whose special object is reëlection. Authentic\r\nevidence before a Congressional Committee shows that Thomas Murphy,\r\nwhile Collector of New York, acting as Lieutenant of the President,\r\nsought to control the Republican State Convention by tendering office\r\nto four men, in consideration of the return of certain delegates,\r\npromising that “he would immediately send their names on to Washington\r\nand have them appointed”; and by way of enforcing the Presidential\r\nsupremacy, he announced with startling effrontery that “President Grant\r\nwas the representative and head of the Republican party, and all good\r\nRepublicans should support him in all his measures and appointments,\r\nand any one who did not do it should be _crushed out_.”[191] If this\r\nwere not authenticated under oath, it would be hard to believe. But\r\nthe New Orleans Custom-House has a story much worse. Here Presidential\r\npretension is mixed with unblushing corruption, in which the Collector,\r\na brother-in-law, is a chief actor. And all for reëlection.[192]\r\n\r\nThis prostitution of the offices of the country to the Presidential\r\nwill can be upheld only by unhesitating partisan zeal, discarding\r\nreason and patriotism. Already it has been condemned in an official\r\nReport made to the House of Representatives, November 25, 1867, by Mr.\r\nBoutwell, as Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, and signed by\r\nhim. His direct object was to arraign Andrew Johnson; but these words\r\ndeclare a rule applicable to all Presidents:--\r\n\r\n    “The presence and active participation of _two of the Heads of\r\n    Departments_ in a political convention at Philadelphia, having\r\n    for its object the organization of a party to sustain the policy\r\n    of the President and defeat the will of Congress and the people,\r\n    and one of those functionaries the prime agent in the removals\r\n    from and appointments to office for ‘political reasons,’ is a fact\r\n    well known to the country. The like had not happened before in its\r\n    history. In the view of right-minded men, it was something more\r\n    than a public scandal.”[193]\r\n\r\nThe Report adduces the authority of John Locke, the eminent\r\nphilosopher, as declaring “the employment of ‘the force, treasure, and\r\n_offices of the society to corrupt the representatives, or openly to\r\npreëngage the electors, and prescribe what manner of persons shall be\r\nchosen_,’ as among those breaches of trust in the executive magistrate\r\nwhich amounts to a dissolution of the Government; for ‘what is it,’ he\r\nsays, ‘but to cut up the Government by the roots, and poison the very\r\nfountains of public security?’”[194] But all this we witness here.\r\nThe offices are employed to preëngage the electors, and prescribe the\r\npersons to be chosen. Nor do I see any corrective of this undoubted\r\nabuse, especially after the example now set in high quarters, so long\r\nas the President is a candidate for reëlection.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to arrest a flagrant tyranny, and to secure purity in the\r\nGovernment, also to save the President from himself, should this\r\nAmendment be adopted; and since Horace Greeley is known to be its\r\nstrenuous supporter, we have an unanswerable reason in his behalf.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECONCILIATION.\r\n\r\nFrom the practical question of Civil Service Reform I pass to\r\nReconciliation, being the most important issue ever presented to the\r\nAmerican people,--reconciliation not only between the two once warring\r\nsections, but also between the two races. This issue, so grand and\r\nbeautiful, was distinctly presented, when Horace Greeley, in accepting\r\nthe Republican nomination at Cincinnati, wrote these memorable words:--\r\n\r\n    “In this faith, and with the distinct understanding, that, if\r\n    elected, I shall be the President, not of a party, but of the whole\r\n    people, I accept your nomination,--in the confident trust that the\r\n    masses of our countrymen, North and South, are eager to clasp hands\r\n    across the bloody chasm which has too long divided them, forgetting\r\n    that they have been enemies, in the joyful consciousness that they\r\n    are, and must henceforth remain, brethren.”[195]\r\n\r\nThe issue was again presented, when thereafter the Democratic Party\r\nin National Convention, acting under an irresistible movement of the\r\npeople, nominated the author of these words.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to see how this noble aspiration can find other\r\nthan a generous response. Nothing but a party spirit which forgets\r\nthe obligations of Christian duty could treat it with indifference,\r\nmuch less make it the occasion of misrepresentation. By no effort of\r\ningenuity or malignity can it be tortured into anything but an offer of\r\nreconciliation, while the very letter of acceptance, where it appears,\r\ndeclares the established supremacy of Equal Rights. Observe also that\r\nit is made only when the work of Reconstruction is ended. Here is the\r\ntestimony of a Senator of South Carolina, in a speech in the Senate,\r\nJanuary 22, 1872:--\r\n\r\n    “The last of the Southern States is admitted to its full privileges\r\n    as a member of the brotherhood of States; the Constitutional\r\n    Amendments intended to secure the principles established by the war\r\n    and subsequent events have been accepted as valid. There can be no\r\n    fear or danger of their being disturbed.”[196]\r\n\r\nBut these things are forgotten; the Sermon on the Mount is forgotten\r\nalso; the Beatitudes are put aside. A great writer of the Middle Ages,\r\nafter dwelling on what is best for us, says:--\r\n\r\n    “Hence it is that not riches, not pleasures, not honors, not length\r\n    of life, not health, not strength, not comeliness, was sung to the\r\n    shepherds from on high, but peace.”[197]\r\n\r\nThe supporters of reëlection will not hearken to this song, and the\r\nproffered hand is rejected. If not war, they would preserve at least\r\nthe passions of war, and instead of peace would scatter distrust and\r\ndefiance. The old fable is renewed:--\r\n\r\n    “Emboldened now on fresh attempt he goes,\r\n    With serpent’s teeth the fertile furrows sows;\r\n    The glebe fermenting with enchanted juice\r\n    Makes the snake’s teeth a human crop produce.”[198]\r\n\r\nFor me there can be but one course on this issue, and the moment it\r\nwas presented I seemed to behold, for the first time, the dawn of that\r\nbetter era in our country when the Equal Rights of All should be\r\nplaced under the safeguard of assured Peace and Reconciliation. Had I\r\nfailed to sympathize with this endeavor, I should have been false to\r\nthe record of my life. My first public utterance, as far back as July\r\n4, 1845, was to commend the cause of Peace, which from that early day,\r\namidst the contentions of public duty and the terrible responsibilities\r\nof war, has never been absent from my mind. While insisting on the\r\nAbolition of Slavery, while urging Enfranchisement, while vindicating\r\nthe Equal Rights of All, and while pressing Reconstruction, I have\r\nconstantly declared that all these were for no purpose of vengeance\r\nor punishment, but only for the security of the citizen and the\r\nestablishment of government on just foundations, and that when this\r\nwas done nobody should outdo me in those generosities that become the\r\nconqueror more than his conquest.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONAL RECORD.\r\n\r\nHere the testimony is complete. If I open it now, it is less to show\r\nthe obligations which constrain me personally than to make these\r\nwitnesses plead again the cause which from the beginning I have had at\r\nheart. I follow the order of time, letting each speak in a few words.\r\n\r\nThere are some among us who may remember that early speech before\r\nthe Republican State Convention at Worcester, October 1, 1861, which\r\nexcited at the time so much discussion, when, after calling for\r\nEmancipation, I united this cause with Peace:--\r\n\r\n    “Two objects are before us, _Union and Peace_, each for the sake\r\n    of the other, and both for the sake of the country; but without\r\n    Emancipation how can we expect either?”[199]\r\n\r\nThus at the beginning was I mindful of Peace.\r\n\r\nThen again, in the same strain, at the Cooper Institute, New York,\r\nNovember 27, 1861, after showing Slavery to be the origin and\r\nmain-spring of the Rebellion, I pleaded for Emancipation, and at the\r\nsame time first sounded the key-note of Reconciliation:--\r\n\r\n    “Perversely and pitifully do you postpone that sure period of\r\n    _reconciliation, not only between the two sections, not only\r\n    between the men of the North and the men of the South, but, more\r\n    necessary still, between slave and master_, without which the true\r\n    tranquillity we all seek cannot be permanently assured. Believe it,\r\n    _only through such reconciliation_, under sanction of freedom, can\r\n    you remove all occasions of conflict hereafter.”[200]\r\n\r\nThus early was reconciliation associated with my most earnest efforts;\r\nnor did I at any moment hesitate in this work.\r\n\r\nThe same spirit was manifest in opposition to perpetuating the memory\r\nof victories over fellow-citizens. The question arose on a dispatch of\r\nGeneral McClellan, where, after announcing the capture of Williamsburg,\r\nhe inquired whether he was “authorized to follow the example of other\r\ngenerals, and direct the names of battles to be placed on the colors of\r\nregiments.”[201] This being communicated to the Senate, I felt it my\r\nduty to move, May 8, 1862, the following resolution:--\r\n\r\n    “_Resolved_, That in the efforts now making for _the restoration of\r\n    the Union and the establishment of peace throughout the country_,\r\n    it is inexpedient that the names of victories obtained over our\r\n    fellow-citizens should be placed on the regimental colors of the\r\n    United States.”[202]\r\n\r\nHere again was anxiety for peace. Mr. Wilson, my colleague,\r\ndid not agree with me, and he made haste to introduce a\r\ncounter-resolution;[203] but no further action was had upon it. The\r\nusage of civilized nations is against placing on regimental colors the\r\nnames of victories gained over fellow-countrymen. In France, the most\r\nmilitary country of the world, the principle was carefully discarded by\r\nKing Louis Philippe, when, in preparing the Museum at Versailles, he\r\nexcluded every picture or image of civil war. Everything to arouse and\r\ngratify the patriotic pride of Frenchmen, of all Frenchmen, is there,\r\nbut nothing to exhibit Frenchmen warring with each other.\r\n\r\nThen came the bills for Confiscation, which I supported chiefly with\r\na view to Emancipation. While enforcing this object, May 19, 1862, I\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n    “People talk flippantly of the gallows as the certain doom of\r\n    the Rebels. This is a mistake. For weal or woe, the gallows is\r\n    out of the question. It is not possible as a punishment for this\r\n    rebellion.”\r\n\r\nThen declaring our supreme object to be Peace, I said:\r\n\r\n    “In this work it is needless to say _there is no place for any\r\n    sentiment of hate or any suggestion of vengeance_. There can\r\n    be no exaction and no punishment beyond the necessity of the\r\n    case,--nothing harsh, nothing excessive. Lenity and pardon become\r\n    the conqueror more even than victory. ‘Do in time of peace the most\r\n    good, and in time of war the least evil possible: such is the Law\r\n    of Nations.’ These are the admirable words of an eminent French\r\n    magistrate and statesman. In this spirit it is our duty to assuage\r\n    the calamities of war, and especially to spare an inoffensive\r\n    population.”[204]\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, June 27th, while the same subject was under\r\nconsideration, I returned to it again:--\r\n\r\n    “But I confess frankly that I look with more hope and confidence\r\n    to Liberation than to Confiscation. To give freedom is nobler\r\n    than to take property, and on this occasion it cannot fail to be\r\n    more efficacious, for in this way the rear-guard of the Rebellion\r\n    will be changed into the advance-guard of the Union. There is in\r\n    Confiscation, unless when directed against the criminal authors of\r\n    the Rebellion, a harshness inconsistent with that mercy which it\r\n    is always a sacred duty to cultivate, and which should be manifest\r\n    in proportion to our triumphs, ‘mightiest in the mightiest.’ _But\r\n    Liberation is not harsh; and it is certain, if properly conducted,\r\n    to carry with it the smiles of a benignant Providence._”[205]\r\n\r\nAt last the country was gladdened by the Proclamation of Emancipation,\r\nwhich here in Faneuil Hall, October 6, 1862, I vindicated as a measure\r\nof peace; and then I said:--\r\n\r\n    “In the old war between King and Parliament, which rent England,\r\n    the generous Falkland cried from his soul, _Peace! Peace!_--and\r\n    History gratefully records his words. Never did he utter this cry\r\n    with more earnestness than I do now. But how shall the blessing be\r\n    secured?”[206]\r\n\r\n_By Emancipation_, was my answer.\r\n\r\nThen came the bill creating the Freedmen’s Bureau. In opening the\r\ndebate on this interesting subject, June 8, 1864, I said:--\r\n\r\n     “It is for the Senate to determine, under the circumstances,\r\n    what it will do. My earnest hope is that it will do something.\r\n    The opportunity must not be lost of helping so many persons now\r\n    helpless, and _of aiding the cause of Reconciliation, without which\r\n    peace cannot be assured_.”[207]\r\n\r\nHere again Reconciliation is announced as an ever-present object.\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit, I deemed it my duty to oppose the efforts made in\r\nthe winter of 1865 to authorize Retaliation, differing from valued\r\nfriends. The proposition for Retaliation was met by the following\r\ndeclaration, moved by me, January 24th:--\r\n\r\n    “The United States … call upon all to bear witness that in this\r\n    necessary warfare with Barbarism they renounce all vengeance and\r\n    every evil example, and plant themselves firmly on the sacred\r\n    landmarks of Christian civilization, under the protection of that\r\n    God who is present with every prisoner, and enables heroic souls to\r\n    suffer for their country.”[208]\r\n\r\nThen came the effort, favored by President Lincoln, to receive\r\nLouisiana with a Constitution which failed to recognize the equal\r\nrights of colored fellow-citizens. Here again, February 25th, I\r\nencountered the proposition by a resolution, where it is declared:--\r\n\r\n    “That such an oligarchical government is not competent at this\r\n    moment to discharge the duties and execute the powers of a State;\r\n    and that its recognition as a legitimate government will tend to\r\n    enfeeble the Union, _to postpone the day of Reconciliation_, and to\r\n    endanger the national tranquillity.”[209]\r\n\r\nMark, if you please, “_the day of Reconciliation_.”\r\n\r\nThen came the question of perpetuating the memory of our victories.\r\nFebruary 27th, the Senate having under consideration an appropriation\r\nfor a picture in the National Capitol, I moved as an amendment,--\r\n\r\n    “That in the National Capitol, dedicated to the National Union,\r\n    there shall be no picture of a victory in battle with our own\r\n    fellow-citizens.”[210]\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson again made haste to announce that he “disagreed with his\r\ncolleague altogether,”--saying, according to the “Congressional\r\nGlobe,”[211] “I do not believe in that doctrine.”\r\n\r\nIn the eulogy on President Lincoln, pronounced before the municipal\r\nauthorities of Boston, June 1, 1865, the great object of Reconciliation\r\nwas presented as dependent on the establishment of our ideas. After\r\ninsisting upon Emancipation and the Equal Suffrage, these words occur:--\r\n\r\n    “Such a vengeance will be a kiss of reconciliation, for it will\r\n    remove every obstacle to peace and harmony. The people where\r\n    Slavery once ruled will bless the blow that destroyed it. The\r\n    people where the kindred tyranny of Caste once prevailed will\r\n    rejoice that this fell under the same blow. They will yet confess\r\n    that it was dealt in no harshness, in no unkindness, in no desire\r\n    to humiliate, but simply and solemnly, in the name of the Republic\r\n    and of Human Nature, for their good as well as ours,--ay, for their\r\n    good more than ours.\r\n\r\n    “By ideas, more than by armies, we have conquered. The sword of the\r\n    Archangel was less mighty than the mission he bore from the Lord.\r\n    But if the ideas giving us the victory are now neglected, if the\r\n    pledges of the Declaration, which the Rebellion openly assailed,\r\n    are left unredeemed, then have blood and treasure been lavished for\r\n    nought.”\r\n\r\nThen I proceeded to ask:--\r\n\r\n    “How shall these ideas be saved? How shall the war waged by Abraham\r\n    Lincoln be brought to an end, _so as to assure peace, tranquillity,\r\n    and reconciliation_?”[212]\r\n\r\nIn the speech at Worcester, before the Republican State Convention,\r\nSeptember 14, 1865, I insisted upon guaranties for the national\r\nfreedman and the national creditor; and until these were accomplished,\r\nproposed to exclude the Rebel from political power:--\r\n\r\n    “I ask not his punishment. I would not be harsh. There is nothing\r\n    humane that I would reject. Nothing in hate. Nothing in vengeance.\r\n    Nothing in passion. I am for gentleness. I am for a velvet glove;\r\n    but for a while I wish the hand of iron. I confess that I have\r\n    little sympathy with those hypocrites of magnanimity whose appeal\r\n    for the Rebel master is only a barbarous indifference towards\r\n    the slave; _and yet they cannot more than I desire the day of\r\n    Reconciliation_.”[213]\r\n\r\nThus constantly did this idea return.\r\n\r\nAnd yet again, in a letter to the “Evening Post” of New York, dated\r\nSeptember 28, 1865, after insisting upon “supplementary safeguards” for\r\nthe protection of the freedman, I used these words:--\r\n\r\n    “Without this additional provision, I see small prospect of\r\n    _that peace and reconciliation which are the objects so near our\r\n    hearts_.”[214]\r\n\r\nAgain it appeared in a telegraphic dispatch to President Johnson, dated\r\nNovember 12, 1865, and afterwards published. Asking the President to\r\nsuspend his “policy towards the Rebel States,” I said:--\r\n\r\n    “I should not present this prayer, if I were not painfully\r\n    convinced that thus far it has failed to obtain any _reasonable\r\n    guaranties for that security in the future which is essential to\r\n    peace and reconciliation_.… The Declaration of Independence asserts\r\n    the equality of all men, and that rightful government can be\r\n    founded only on the consent of the governed. I see small chance of\r\n    peace, unless these great principles are practically established.\r\n    Without this, the house will continue divided against itself.”[215]\r\n\r\nHere Reconciliation is associated with Reconstruction on the basis of\r\nthe Equality of All Men.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, in the “Atlantic Monthly” for December, 1865, p.\r\n758, I pleaded again:--\r\n\r\n    “The lesson of Clemency is of perpetual obligation.… Harshness\r\n    is bad. Cruelty is detestable. Even Justice may relent at the\r\n    prompting of Mercy. Fail not, then, to cultivate the grace of\r\n    Clemency.…\r\n\r\n    “There must be no vengeance upon enemies; but there must be no\r\n    sacrifice of friends. And here is the distinction never to be\r\n    forgotten: _Nothing for vengeance; everything for justice_. Follow\r\n    this rule, and the Republic will be safe and glorious.”[216]\r\n\r\nThen again in the Senate speech, February 5 and 6, 1866, while dwelling\r\nat length upon Equal Suffrage without distinction of color, I thus\r\nspoke for the Southern people:--\r\n\r\n     “The people there are my fellow-citizens, and gladly would I\r\n    hail them, if they would permit, as no longer _a section_, no\r\n    longer _the South_, but an integral part of the Republic, under a\r\n    Constitution which, knowing no North and no South, cannot tolerate\r\n    _sectional_ pretension. Gladly, in all sincerity, do I offer\r\n    my best effort for their welfare. But I see clearly that there\r\n    is nothing in the compass of mortal power so important to them\r\n    in every respect, morally, politically, and economically--that\r\n    there is nothing with such certain promise to them of beneficent\r\n    result--that there is nothing so sure to make their land smile\r\n    with industry and fertility,--as the decree of Equal Rights I now\r\n    invoke.… This is our retaliation. This is our only revenge.”[217]\r\n\r\nIn an address at the Music Hall, in Boston, October 2, 1866, entitled\r\n“The One-Man Power _vs._ Congress,” I declared that the Reconstruction\r\nI sought was one where “the Rebel region, no longer harassed by\r\ncontroversy and degraded by injustice, _will enjoy the richest fruits\r\nof security and reconciliation_,”--and then added, “_To labor for this\r\ncause may well tempt the young and rejoice the old_.”[218]\r\n\r\nThen, in the same address, I said:--\r\n\r\n    “Our first duty is to provide safeguards for the future. This can\r\n    be only by provisions, sure, fundamental, and irrepealable, fixing\r\n    forever the results of the war, the obligations of the Government,\r\n    and the equal rights of all. Such is the suggestion of common\r\n    prudence and of self-defence, as well as of common honesty. To this\r\n    end we must make haste slowly. States which precipitated themselves\r\n    out of Congress must not be permitted to precipitate themselves\r\n    back. They must not enter the Halls they treasonably deserted,\r\n    until we have every reasonable assurance of future good conduct. We\r\n    must not admit them, and then repent our folly.…\r\n\r\n    “But, while holding this ground of prudence, I desire to disclaim\r\n    every sentiment of vengeance or punishment, and also every thought\r\n    of delay or procrastination. Here I do not yield to the President,\r\n    or to any other person. Nobody more anxious than I to see this\r\n    chasm closed forever.\r\n\r\n    “_There is a long way and a short way. There is a long time and a\r\n    short time._ If there be any whose policy is for the longest way\r\n    or for the longest time, I am not of the number. _I am for the\r\n    shortest way, and also for the shortest time._”[219]\r\n\r\nThen in considering Reconstruction in the Senate, March 16, 1867, I\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n    “But I ask nothing in vengeance or unkindness. All that I propose\r\n    is for their good, with which is intertwined the good of all.\r\n    I would not impose any new penalty or bear hard upon an erring\r\n    people. Oh, no! I simply ask a new safeguard for the future, that\r\n    these States, through which so much trouble has come, may be a\r\n    strength and a blessing to our common country, with prosperity\r\n    and happiness everywhere within their borders. I would not impose\r\n    any new burden; but I seek a new triumph for civilization. _For a\r\n    military occupation bristling with bayonets I would substitute the\r\n    smile of Peace._”\r\n\r\nI then said:--\r\n\r\n    “But this cannot be without Education. As the soldier disappears,\r\n    his place must be supplied by the schoolmaster. The muster-roll\r\n    will be exchanged for the school-register, and our head-quarters\r\n    will be in a school-house.”\r\n\r\nAnd I accompanied this with a proposition to require in the\r\nreconstructed States “a system of public schools open to all, without\r\ndistinction of race or color,” which was lost by a tie vote, being 20\r\nto 20.[220]\r\n\r\nThe subject recurred again in the Senate July 13, 1867, when, after\r\ndeclaring regret at the inadequacy of the pending measure, especially\r\nin not securing a system of Public Education, and not excluding Rebel\r\ninfluence, I remarked:--\r\n\r\n    “In saying this, I desire to add, that, in my judgment, all\r\n    exclusions belong to what I call _the transition period_. When\r\n    Reconstruction is accomplished, the time will come for us to open\r\n    the gates.”[221]\r\n\r\nIn these few words will be found the ruling principle which I have\r\nrecognized in Reconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe address, “Are We a Nation?” made at the Cooper Institute, November\r\n19, 1867, testifies again to Reconciliation. After showing how the\r\nnational supremacy in the guardianship of equal rights is consistent\r\nwith local self-government, and vindicating the two in their respective\r\nspheres, it says:--\r\n\r\n    “There will be a sphere alike for the States and Nation. Local\r\n    self-government, which is the pride of our institutions, will\r\n    be reconciled with the national supremacy in maintenance of\r\n    human rights, and the two together will constitute the elemental\r\n    principles of the Republic. The States will exercise a minute\r\n    jurisdiction required for the convenience of all; the Nation\r\n    will exercise that other paramount jurisdiction required for the\r\n    protection of all. _The reconciliation--God bless the word!_--thus\r\n    begun will embrace the people, who, forgetting past differences,\r\n    will feel more than ever that they are one.”[222]\r\n\r\nThen again, in addressing the Republican State Convention at Worcester,\r\nSeptember 22, 1869, I said:--\r\n\r\n    “Do not think me harsh; do not think me austere. I am not. I will\r\n    not be outdone by anybody in clemency; nor at the proper time will\r\n    I be behind any one in opening all doors of office and trust.…\r\n    Who can object, if men recently arrayed against their country are\r\n    told to stand aside yet a little longer, until all are secure in\r\n    their rights? Here is no fixed exclusion,--nothing of which there\r\n    can be any just complaint,--nothing which is not practical, wise,\r\n    humane,--nothing which is not born of justice rather than victory.\r\n    In the establishment of Equal Rights conquest loses its character,\r\n    and is no longer conquest,--\r\n\r\n        ‘For then both parties nobly are subdued,\r\n        And neither party loser.’”[223]\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONAL DUTY.\r\n\r\nHere I suspend this testimony. Such is the simple and harmonious\r\nrecord, showing how from the beginning I was devoted to peace,--how\r\nconstantly I longed for reconciliation,--how with every measure\r\nof Equal Rights this longing found utterance,--how it became an\r\nessential part of my life,--how I discarded all idea of vengeance\r\nor punishment,--how Reconstruction was to my mind a transition\r\nperiod,--and how earnestly I looked forward to the day, when, after\r\nthe recognition of Equal Rights, the Republic should again be one in\r\nreality as in name. If there are any who ever maintained a policy of\r\nhate, I was never so minded; and now in protesting against any such\r\npolicy, I only act in obedience to the irresistible promptings of my\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nIn embracing the opportunity unexpectedly presented at this election,\r\nI keep myself still in harmony with the past. Unable to vote a second\r\ntime for President Grant, and confident that the choice of Horace\r\nGreeley will tend to assure that triumph of peace which has occupied so\r\nmuch of my desires, it only remains to vote for him. I would not expect\r\ntoo much; but, knowing something of the spirit in which the Democratic\r\nparty has adopted him as its candidate, and knowing something also of\r\nhis eminent character, I cannot doubt that with his election there will\r\nbe a new order of things, where the harsh instrumentalities of power\r\nwill yield to a sentiment of good-will, and surviving irritations will\r\nbe lost in concord. The war is ended. There must be an end also to\r\nbelligerent passions; and the freedman, assured in rights, must enter\r\nupon a new career of happiness and prosperity. Such, at least, is\r\nthe object I now seek. Even those differing from me in faith at this\r\ncritical moment will not deny that such a result would mark an epoch in\r\nAmerican history. And now, in the hope of its accomplishment, I forget\r\npersonal consequences, and think only of the inestimable good.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREJUDICE AND INVENTION.\r\n\r\nThe partisans of Reëlection, resorting to prejudice and invention,\r\ninsist, first, that the Democratic party, which has adopted as its\r\ncandidate an original Republican on a Republican platform, will\r\nprove untrue, and, secondly, that the candidate himself will prove\r\nuntrue,--as if the Democratic party were not bound now to the very\r\nprinciples declared at Philadelphia, without the viscous alloy of\r\nGrantism, and as if the life and character of the candidate were not a\r\nsufficient answer to any such slander.\r\n\r\n\r\nADHESION OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.\r\n\r\nEvidently there are individuals, calling themselves Democrats, who\r\nfeel little sympathy with the movement, and there are others who\r\ninsist upon the old hates, whether towards the North or towards the\r\nfreedman. Unhappily, this is only according to human nature. It must\r\nbe so. Therefore, though pained in feeling, my trust is not disturbed\r\nby sporadic cases cited in newspapers, or by local incidents. This is\r\nclear: in spite of politicians, and against their earnest efforts, the\r\npeople represented in the Democratic Convention adopted a Republican\r\nnomination and platform. Baltimore answered to Cincinnati. A popular\r\nuprising, stirred by irresistible instinct, triumphed over all\r\nresistance. The people were wiser than their leaders,--illustrating\r\nagain the saying of the French statesman, so experienced in human\r\naffairs, that above the wisdom of any individual, however great, is the\r\nwisdom of all. But this testifies to that Providence which shapes our\r\nends:\r\n\r\n    “So Providence for us, high, infinite,\r\n    Makes our necessities its watchful task.”\r\n\r\nPlainly in recent events there has been a presiding influence against\r\nwhich all machinations have been powerless. Had the Convention at\r\nPhiladelphia nominated a good Republican, truly representing Republican\r\nprinciples without drawback, there is no reason to believe that Horace\r\nGreeley would have been a candidate. The persistence for President\r\nGrant dissolved original bonds, and gave practical opportunity to the\r\npresent movement. The longing for peace, which in existing antagonisms\r\nof party was without effective expression, at last found free course.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the original Republican who had announced himself ready\r\nto “clasp hands” in peace was accepted on a Republican platform,\r\ndeclaring support of the three Constitutional amendments, and placing\r\nin the foreground the great truth that all men are equal before the\r\nlaw. Such is the historic fact. That the party will be disloyal to this\r\nact, that it will turn its back on its covenants, and seek through a\r\nRepublican President to reverse these safeguards, or in any way impair\r\ntheir efficacy, is not only without probability, but to imagine it is\r\nabsolutely absurd.\r\n\r\nBeyond the unequivocal adhesion of the party in its corporate capacity\r\nis that of eminent members who volunteer as individuals in the same\r\ndeclarations, so that personal pledge unites with party obligation. I\r\nquote two instances at hand.\r\n\r\nMr. Hendricks, so well known for his service in the National Senate,\r\nsaid recently in the Democratic State Convention of Indiana, on his\r\nnomination for Governor:--\r\n\r\n    “We have this day substantially turned our backs upon the Past. We\r\n    now stand in the Present, and look forward to the great Future. The\r\n    Past is gone.”\r\n\r\nNobody in the country can speak for his party with more authority; nor\r\ncould there be better words to denote the change that has occurred.\r\n\r\nMr. Kerr, also of Indiana, an able Democratic Representative in\r\nCongress, and now Congressional candidate at large, bears the same\r\ntestimony. In a recent speech this distinguished Democrat says:--\r\n\r\n     “The best impulse, the most patriotic sentiment, the most\r\n    intelligent judgment of the wisest and the best men of the country\r\n    now demand that the accomplished results of our great civil war,\r\n    as they are crystallized in the Amendments to the Constitution,\r\n    shall stand as parts of the fundamental law of the country, to be\r\n    obeyed and maintained in good faith, without evasion, denial, or\r\n    diminution, in favor of all classes of the people. The Democratic\r\n    party, in the most authoritative and solemn manner, accepts this\r\n    judgment.”\r\n\r\nNothing could be more complete. All the Amendments are “to be obeyed\r\nand maintained in good faith, without evasion, denial, or diminution,\r\nin favor of all classes of the people”; and this is the covenant of the\r\nDemocratic party, countersigned by their Representative. Not content\r\nwith this unequivocal adhesion, the speaker proceeds:--\r\n\r\n    “Any intelligent citizen, in public or private life, who\r\n    charges that the Democratic party, if invested with power,\r\n    would reëstablish slavery, or pay for slaves, or assume or pay\r\n    Confederate debts, and take suffrage from colored men, or do other\r\n    acts in defiance of the Constitution, must be a hypocrite and\r\n    a demagogue, and he can have no higher aim than to slander and\r\n    deceive.”\r\n\r\nIt is easy to pardon the indignation with which this Democrat repels\r\nthe calumnies employed to sow distrust.\r\n\r\nIn strictest harmony with these authorities is the public press\r\nentitled to speak for the Democratic party. Out of innumerable\r\ntestimonies I content myself with two.\r\n\r\nThe Cincinnati “Enquirer,” a leading Democratic journal, of August 1st,\r\nalluding to myself, says:--\r\n\r\n     “His confidence in the honor of the Democratic party is not\r\n    misplaced. It will stand by the position which it assumed at\r\n    Baltimore, and maintain it under any and all circumstances. Upon\r\n    that he may depend.”\r\n\r\nThen again the same Democratic organ says:--\r\n\r\n    “It pleases some of the Grant papers to speak of Mr. Greeley as\r\n    a Democratic candidate, because he was nominated by a Democratic\r\n    Convention. They ignore the fact that he had been previously\r\n    nominated by a Republican Convention,--that he has always been a\r\n    Republican, and never cast a Democratic ballot in his life. None of\r\n    them have answered our query, whether they would have considered\r\n    General Grant the Democratic candidate, if he had been nominated at\r\n    Baltimore; and if not, why do they make the difference between him\r\n    and Greeley?”\r\n\r\nThe Washington “Patriot,” the Democratic journal at the national\r\ncapital, of August 7th, thus explicitly pronounces:--\r\n\r\n    “The Democratic party have loyally and honorably conditioned to\r\n    uphold the Cincinnati platform and all its obligations. _They mean\r\n    to fulfil that bond in good faith and to the last letter._ Hence\r\n    not a word was altered at Baltimore, not a letter changed, not a\r\n    comma erased. _We took it in the exact sense and in all the spirit\r\n    of the several declarations, with entire knowledge of the duty\r\n    which they enjoined, and an honest purpose to perform it at any\r\n    cost._ So far from regarding that acceptance as a sacrifice, it was\r\n    welcomed everywhere with joy.”\r\n\r\nAre these speakers and these newspapers united in conspiracy to\r\ndeceive, or are they dupes? Spurning the idea of dishonest conspiracy,\r\nI cannot doubt that they believe what they say, and that what they say\r\nis true. Again I insist that the sallies of local disaffection or of\r\npersonal brutality, however painful or discreditable, cannot interfere\r\nto change the open adhesion of the party, followed by declarations so\r\nauthentic in form. On this open adhesion and these declarations I act,\r\nand to the complete fulfilment of all the obligations assumed I feel\r\nthat I may confidently hold the party.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTIVES TO KEEP THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY TRUE.\r\n\r\nBut why should the Democratic party be untrue to the covenants it\r\nhas assumed? This imputation, so insulting to a great political\r\norganization, and to the distinguished members who have openly united\r\nin its adhesion, cannot be accepted without some ground of reason,\r\nor at least of presumption. But all reason and every presumption are\r\nthe other way. Men act according to their supposed interests,--this\r\nis a law of human nature; but every interest of former Rebels is for\r\npeace. Under the influence of uncontrolled passion, and for the sake of\r\nSlavery, they went into rebellion; but now that passion has abated and\r\nSlavery has ceased, they see that nothing is gained by prolonging the\r\nanimosities it engendered. Peace has become their absorbing interest.\r\nSo obvious is the advantage from this assured possession, that it is\r\nunreasonable to suppose them indifferent when it is within reach; it\r\nis absurd to imagine them professing peace as a cover for war,--war\r\nin which they know they must fail. This explains the promptitude with\r\nwhich they seized the opportunity now presented. At once they declared\r\ntheir desire and offered the hand of fellowship, at the same time\r\nannouncing their acceptance of those great measures by which the Equal\r\nRights of All are assured.\r\n\r\nThe motives naturally governing former Rebels, in accepting Horace\r\nGreeley and a Republican platform, are plain. There is, first, the\r\ngeneral prostration of their region, which they would see improved; but\r\nthis can be only by the establishment of peace undisturbed, so that\r\nall men, white and black, may live in security. This is an essential\r\ncondition. Violence breeds a kindred crop; nor can distrust exist\r\nwithout detriment to all. Let either appear, and the most fertile\r\nfields will fail in productive power. Men will not mingle their sweat\r\nwith the soil, becoming colaborers with the sun,--they will not sow and\r\nplough,--unless assured in the enjoyment of what the generous earth\r\nis ready to yield. Above all, those truest allies so essential to\r\nprosperous industry, capital and immigration, will turn away from the\r\nland that is not blessed by peace. Security is a constant invitation\r\nand encouragement. There must be security in all things,--security in\r\nlife, security in property, and security in rights, including Liberty\r\nand Equality, the great promises of the Declaration of Independence.\r\nLet any of these be in any peril, let any shadow rest upon their\r\nenjoyment, and the whole community must suffer. Therefore by the\r\nimpulse of self-interest, now clearly manifest, are the people of the\r\nSouth moved to the present effort for peace.\r\n\r\nThis same motive assumes another form in the desire to escape from\r\nexisting misrule, which has left such traces in the disordered finances\r\nof the Southern States. So colossal has been the scale of plunder that\r\neven authentic report seems like fable. Second only to the wide-spread\r\ndevastations of war are the robberies to which these States have been\r\nsubjected,--I am sorry to say, under an Administration calling itself\r\nRepublican, at Washington, and with local governments deriving their\r\nanimating impulse from the party in power, with the President as its\r\ndominant head. Surely the people in these communities would have been\r\nless than men, if, sinking under the intolerable burden, they did not\r\nturn for help to a new party, promising reform and honesty. They have\r\nseen custom-houses used to maintain the plunderers in power; they have\r\nseen all available political forces pressed to procure the renewed rule\r\nof the President under whom they have suffered so much; and they have\r\nseen this very President teach by example that every office-holder\r\nshould begin by looking out for himself. It would be a wonder, if they\r\ndid not join the present movement and maintain its declared purposes to\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that under these promptings, where personal and local\r\ninterests were so strong, Horace Greeley was commended as a candidate,\r\nand then sincerely accepted. They knew him as the steadfast enemy of\r\nSlavery so long as it existed, dealing against it hard and constant\r\nblows; they knew him as the faithful ally of the freedman, insisting\r\npromptly upon his equal right to suffrage, which he vindicated with\r\npersuasive power; and they knew him also as the devoted friend of the\r\ncolored race, never failing in effort for their welfare: but they knew\r\nalso that he was a lover of peace and honesty, whose soul had been\r\ntransfigured in works, and that, as sincerely as he had striven for the\r\ncolored race, he now strove to mitigate those other burdens which had\r\nreduced them to a new slavery, being a debt which was like chain and\r\nmanacle upon their industry; and they were assured that with _him_ the\r\ngreat office for which he is a candidate would be a trust and not a\r\npersonal perquisite, so that his example would be constant testimony\r\nto industry, integrity, and fidelity in the discharge of public duties,\r\nthus fixing a standard for all. These things being evident, how could\r\nthey hesitate?\r\n\r\n\r\nFAITH IN HORACE GREELEY.\r\n\r\nThe partisans of Reëlection dwell much on the position and character\r\nof Mr. Greeley, insisting that he cannot be trusted in the\r\nPresidency,--partly because helped into power by Democrats, and partly\r\nfrom an alleged want of stability. It is difficult to hear these\r\nbarefaced allegations, in utter disregard of the prodigious testimony\r\nafforded by his long career, without wonder at the extent to which\r\nprejudice and invention can be carried. Had he been presented at\r\nPhiladelphia with the saving sanction of a regular nomination, the same\r\npartisans who now seek to exhibit him as a tool or an imbecile would\r\ndwell with pride on his eminent qualities, making him, by the side of\r\nhis competitor, an angel of light. Knowing them both, his superiority\r\nI may affirm. To say that under him Slavery can in any way be revived,\r\nor that the Rebel debt or the pension of Rebel soldiers or compensation\r\nfor slaves can find favor, or that the equal rights of the freedmen, to\r\nwhich he is so solemnly pledged, can in any way be impaired,--all this\r\nis simply atrocious. Nothing of the kind can be done without violation\r\nof the Constitution as amended,--not to speak of the departure from\r\nthat rule of life which he has ever followed. There is no Democrat\r\nsympathizing with his nomination who would not spurn the infamous\r\ntreachery. I dismiss the whole partisan extravagance to the contempt it\r\ndeserves.\r\n\r\nThe imputation that his election will be the return to power of\r\nthe old Democratic party is much like saying that he will cease to\r\nbe himself, and that his surpassing individuality, making him so\r\nconspicuous, will be lost. They who make the imputation forget that\r\nthis old party, if it has not ceased to exist, is changed in character.\r\nStanding on a Republican platform, and with a Republican candidate,\r\nit may look the Republican party in the face, claiming for itself\r\nthe Future, if not the Past. Plainly it is not that Democratic party\r\nagainst which Republicans have contended. If Democrats have influence\r\nwith Horace Greeley, it will be because they have sincerely placed\r\nthemselves by his side on a platform which distinctly announces all\r\nthat Republicans have ever claimed.\r\n\r\nAgainst all pretended distrust I oppose the open record of his life.\r\nBy this let him be judged. And here it will be observed, that, while\r\nsometimes differing from others in methods, he has never, at any\r\nmoment, ceased to be a champion, being always the same. Here is a\r\nprivate letter, which has only recently appeared, being a gleam of\r\nsunlight from his soul, which the dark days of the war could not\r\nquench:--\r\n\r\n                                       OFFICE OF THE TRIBUNE, NEW YORK,\r\n                                                         June 26, 1863.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SIR,--In God’s good time this is to be a land of real\r\n    freedom, where equal rights and equal laws shall banish rebellion,\r\n    treason, and riot, and all manner of kindred diabolisms. I hardly\r\n    hope to live to see that day, but hope that those who may remember\r\n    me, when I am gone, will believe that I earnestly tried to hasten\r\n    its coming.\r\n\r\n        Yours,\r\n\r\n            HORACE GREELEY.\r\n\r\nTo suppose, that, under any circumstances of pressure or temptation,\r\nhe can fail in loyalty to the cause he has served so constantly, is\r\nan offence to reason and to decency. In his two letters of acceptance\r\nthis loyalty is nobly conspicuous. Replying to the nomination at\r\nCincinnati, he drew the wise line between “local self-government” and\r\n“centralization,” asserting the former as our true policy, “_subject_\r\nto our solemn constitutional obligation to maintain the equal rights\r\nof all citizens,”[224]--thus placing these under national safeguard,\r\nand making them absolutely the same in all parts of the country.\r\nReplying to the nomination at Baltimore, made after the enunciation\r\nof this master principle, he announces his “hope and trust that the\r\nfirst century of American Independence will not close before the\r\ngrand elemental truths on which its rightfulness was originally based\r\nby Jefferson and the Continental Congress of 1776 will have become\r\nthe universally accepted and honored foundations of our political\r\nfabric.”[225] And thus is his great record crowned.\r\n\r\nLiving so entirely in the public eye, all know his life, which\r\nspeaks for him now. Who so well as himself could stand the trial?\r\nThe “Tribune,” in its career of more than thirty years, speaks for\r\nhim also. Those opponents who in the work of disparagement assert\r\nthat he wants executive ability, I point to this journal, begun by\r\nHorace Greeley in 1841, without partner or business associate, with a\r\ncash capital of only one thousand dollars, and with but six hundred\r\nsubscribers. And yet, under his individual effort, by his amazing\r\nindustry and through his rare intelligence, with his determined nature\r\nanimating all, the enterprise prospered, until he found himself at\r\nthe head of one of the first newspapers of the world, completely\r\norganized intellectually and mechanically, with writers for every\r\nsubject, with correspondents everywhere at home and abroad, and with a\r\nconstantly increasing influence never surpassed in newspaper history.\r\nA President with the ability that did all this would impart new energy\r\nto the public service, impressing it with his own faithful character,\r\nand assuring, on a larger scale, a corresponding success, so that the\r\nwhole country would be gainer. Again, those opponents who assert that\r\nHorace Greeley wants fidelity, or that he can be easily swayed against\r\nlife-long convictions, I point to this same journal, which from the\r\nbeginning, and throughout the whole course of its existence, has been\r\nan unwavering representative of the liberal cause, foremost always\r\nin warfare with Slavery, prompt in support of reform, inflexible in\r\nhonesty, and a beacon-flame to all struggling for human advancement.\r\n\r\nNot to put faith in Horace Greeley is to act not only without evidence,\r\nbut against evidence so manifest and constant in unbroken continuity as\r\nto seem like a law of Nature. As well distrust the sun in its appointed\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n\r\nANSWER TO TWO OBJECTIONS.\r\n\r\nSuch is the easy answer to objectors who cry out, that Democrats\r\nuniting with Republicans on a Republican platform cannot be trusted,\r\nand that the candidate himself cannot be trusted. The wantonness of\r\npartisanship is too apparent in this pretension. I have considered it\r\ncarefully, as a lover of truth, and you have my conclusion. Therefore\r\ndo I say, Be not deterred from voting for Horace Greeley because\r\nDemocrats will also vote for him, but rather rejoice. Their votes will\r\nbe a new bond of peace, and a new assurance for the great principles\r\ndeclared by our fathers at our birth as a nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLIVE-BRANCH AND EQUAL RIGHTS.\r\n\r\nAnd has not the time arrived when in sincerity we should accept the\r\nolive-branch? Is it not time for the pen to take the place of the\r\nsword? Is it not time for the Executive Mansion to be changed from\r\na barrack cesspool to a life-giving fountain? Is it not time for a\r\nPresident who will show by example the importance of reform, and teach\r\nthe duty of subordinating personal objects to the public service? Is\r\nit not time for the Head of the National Government to represent the\r\nidea of peace and reconciliation, rather than of battle and strife?\r\nIs it not time for that new era, when ancient enemies, forgetting the\r\npast, shall “clasp hands” in true unity with the principles of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence as the supreme law? Deploring the fate\r\nof Poland and of Ireland, I seize the earliest moment to escape from\r\nsimilar possibility here. Mindful that the memories of the Past can\r\nonly yield to a happy Present, something would I do to promote this\r\nend. Anxious for the Equal Rights of All, and knowing well that no\r\ntext of Law or Constitution is adequate without a supporting sentiment\r\nbehind, I cannot miss the opportunity afforded by the present election\r\nof obtaining this strength for our great guaranties.\r\n\r\nReconstruction is now complete. Every State is represented in\r\nthe Senate, and every District is represented in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. Every Senator and every Representative is in his\r\nplace. There are no vacant seats in either Chamber; and among the\r\nmembers are fellow-citizens of the African race. And amnesty, nearly\r\nuniversal, has been adopted. In this condition of things I find new\r\nreason for change. The present incumbent knows little of our frame of\r\ngovernment. By military education and military genius he represents the\r\nidea of Force; nor is he any exception to the rule of his profession,\r\nwhich appreciates only slightly a government that is not arbitrary.\r\nThe time for the soldier has passed, especially when his renewed power\r\nwould once more remind fellow-citizens of their defeat. Victory over\r\nfellow-citizens should be known only in the rights it assures; nor\r\nshould it be flaunted in the face of the vanquished. It should not\r\nbe inscribed on regimental colors, or portrayed in pictures at the\r\nNational Capitol. But the present incumbent is a regimental color with\r\nthe forbidden inscription; he is a picture at the National Capitol\r\nrecalling victories over fellow-citizens. It is doubtful if such a\r\npresence can promote true reconciliation. Friendship does not grow\r\nwhere former differences are thrust into sight. There are wounds of the\r\nmind as of the body; these, too, must be healed. Instead of irritation\r\nand pressure, let there be gentleness and generosity. Men in this\r\nworld get only what they give,--prejudice for prejudice, animosity\r\nfor animosity, hate for hate. Likewise confidence is returned for\r\nconfidence, good-will for good-will, friendship for friendship. On\r\nthis rule, which is the same for the nation as for the individual, I\r\nwould now act. So will the Republic be elevated to new heights of moral\r\ngrandeur, and our people will manifest that virtue, “greatest of all,”\r\nwhich is found in charity. Above the conquest of others will be the\r\nconquest of ourselves. Nor will any fellow-citizen suffer in rights,\r\nbut all will find new safeguard in the comprehensive fellowship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO NAMES OF BATTLES WITH FELLOW-CITIZENS ON THE ARMY-REGISTER OR THE\r\nREGIMENTAL COLORS OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nBILL IN THE SENATE, DECEMBER 2, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n    December 2, 1872, Mr. Sumner asked, and by unanimous consent\r\n    obtained, leave to bring in the following bill, which was read\r\n    twice and ordered to be printed:--\r\n\r\nA Bill to regulate the Army-Register and the Regimental Colors of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nWhereas the national unity and good-will among fellow-citizens can be\r\nassured only through oblivion of past differences, and it is contrary\r\nto the usage of civilized nations to perpetuate the memory of civil\r\nwar: Therefore,\r\n\r\n_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled_, That the names of battles\r\nwith fellow-citizens shall not be continued in the Army-Register, or\r\nplaced on the regimental colors of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIBUTE TO HORACE GREELEY.\r\n\r\nREMARKS INTENDED TO BE MADE IN THE SENATE, IN SECONDING A MOTION FOR\r\nADJOURNMENT ON THE OCCASION OF MR. GREELEY’S FUNERAL, DECEMBER 3, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The death of Mr. Greeley at the close of the canvass in which\r\n    nearly three millions of his fellow-citizens had given him their\r\n    suffrages for the Presidency, seemed, in the view of leading\r\n    Senators on both sides, to require from their body a respectful\r\n    recognition of the day appointed for his funeral; and it was\r\n    accordingly arranged that a motion for adjournment on this occasion\r\n    should be offered by Mr. Fenton, of New York, and seconded by\r\n    Mr. Sumner, with appropriate remarks by each. But a dominant\r\n    party-spirit, by recourse to parliamentary tactics, prevented\r\n    its introduction, and the day passed without notice. The remarks\r\n    designed by Mr. Sumner were as follows:--\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT,--I have been requested to second this motion. One word,\r\nif you please. A funeral will take place to-morrow, on which the eyes\r\nof the nation will rest, while innumerable hearts throb with grief, and\r\nthe people everywhere learn the instability of life and the commandment\r\nof charity. It is proper, therefore, for the representatives of the\r\nnation to suspend labor, that they too may be penetrated by the lesson\r\nof the day. More for them than the illustrious dead is this needed. He\r\nis gone beyond any earthly call; we remain. Duties are always for the\r\nliving; and now, standing at the open grave of HORACE GREELEY, we are\r\nadmonished to forget the strifes of party, and to remember only truth,\r\ncountry, and mankind, to which his honest life was devoted. In other\r\ndays the horse and armor of the departed chieftain have been buried in\r\nthe grave where he reposed. So, too, may we bury the animosities, if\r\nnot the badges, of the past. Then, indeed, will there be victory for\r\nthe dead which all will share.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIEF OF BOSTON.\r\n\r\nREMARKS IN THE SENATE, DECEMBER 12, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The subject under consideration was a bill from the House providing\r\n    for a drawback of the duties on all materials imported into Boston\r\n    for the rebuilding of that portion of the city laid waste by the\r\n    recent conflagration,--with amendments, including one excepting\r\n    lumber, proposed by the Committee on Finance, to whom the bill had\r\n    been referred.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Sumner said:--\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT,--Hoping that the Senate will not be less generous than\r\nthe House of Representatives, I trust that we shall take the bill as\r\nit comes from the House, voting down the amendments reported by our\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nI hear it said by the Senator from Michigan [Mr. FERRY] that the\r\nbill will be a bad precedent; and the same argument is repeated,\r\nwith variety of illustration, by my excellent friend the Senator\r\nfrom Vermont [Mr. MORRILL]. Sir, is it not too late to correct the\r\nprecedent? You already have the case of Portland and the case of\r\nChicago; I am sorry that you must now add the case of Boston. Call it\r\na bad precedent. It can only be applicable in a parallel case, and I\r\ndo not believe such cases can occur often. The fire-fiend latterly\r\nhas been very busy in our land; but he cannot always be so; at least\r\nI have a well-founded trust that by proper precaution, if not also\r\nby better fortune, we shall escape from his visitations. I put aside,\r\ntherefore, the argument that this is a bad precedent. It can be called\r\ninto activity only in a similar case; and when a similar case occurs, I\r\nam ready for its application. Let any other metropolis sit like Boston\r\nin ashes, and I hope there will be no hesitation in extending to it a\r\nfriendly hand.\r\n\r\nIt is not fair to call up the smaller losses that may occur in smaller\r\nplaces, for the simple reason that such losses are not within the reach\r\nof Congress by any ordinary exercise of its powers. It is only where\r\nthe loss is great, as in the familiar cases before us, that there\r\nis opportunity for Congress. An ancient poet says: “Nor should the\r\nDivinity intervene, unless the occasion be worthy.”[226] I would say,\r\nNor should Congress interfere, unless the case be such as to justify\r\nthe exercise of extraordinary powers. Obviously such an occasion does\r\nnot occur except where the scale of loss is great.\r\n\r\nThen, again, the Senator from Michigan reminded us of the exception of\r\nlumber in the bill for the relief of Chicago; but he vindicated that\r\nexception by facts which do not occur in the present case. He said,\r\nas we all know, that Michigan was also a sufferer at that calamitous\r\nmoment; and he did not think it right, therefore, that the peculiar\r\ninterests of his State should be called to contribute even to the great\r\nlosses of Chicago. I do not say that the Senator was not entirely\r\nright in that position. Certainly the case as presented by him is\r\nentirely reasonable. Had I had the honor to represent Michigan at the\r\ntime, I know not that I should have acted otherwise than he did. But I\r\ncall attention to the point, as presented by him, that no such case\r\nexists now. Michigan is not a sufferer; Maine is not a sufferer; nor\r\nis any part of our country which contributes timber to our business a\r\nsufferer. Therefore is there no reason for introducing this exception.\r\nThe reason failing, the exception should fail also. I hope, therefore,\r\nthat the Senate will keep the bill in that respect precisely as it came\r\nfrom the House.\r\n\r\nThen my friend from Vermont suggests that this bill is practically\r\nan invitation to the people of Boston to go to Europe and elsewhere\r\nin order to find workmen. He seemed frightened at the possibility. I\r\nthink my friend sees too often the question of protection to American\r\nindustry, and makes himself too unhappy on this account. I hope that\r\nthis bill will be considered without any question of protection. Let\r\nthe people of Boston go where they can buy cheapest in order to meet\r\ntheir great calamity; and if it be to their neighbor British provinces,\r\nI hope my friend from Vermont will not interfere to prevent it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LATE HON. GARRETT DAVIS, SENATOR OF KENTUCKY.\r\n\r\nREMARKS IN THE SENATE ON HIS DEATH, DECEMBER 18, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT,--I was a member of the Senate, when, in 1861, our\r\ndeparted Senator entered it; and I was to the end the daily witness\r\nof his laborious service. Standing now at his funeral, it is easy to\r\nforget the differences between us and remember those things in which he\r\nwas an example to all.\r\n\r\nDeath has its companionship. In its recent autumn harvest were Garrett\r\nDavis, William H. Seward, and Horace Greeley. Seward was the precise\r\ncontemporary of Davis, each beginning life with the century and dying\r\nwithin a few days of each other. Always alike in constancy of labor,\r\nthey were for the larger part of this period associated in political\r\nsentiment as active members of the old Whig party. But the terrible\r\nquestion of Slavery rose to divide them. How completely they were on\r\nopposite sides I need not say. Horace Greeley was ten years the junior,\r\nbut he was the colleague and peer of Garrett Davis in devotion to Henry\r\nClay. In the whole country, among all whose enthusiastic support he\r\naroused, there was no one who upheld the Kentucky statesman with more\r\nchivalrous devotion than these two. Here they were alike, and in the\r\nrecord of life this signal fidelity cannot be forgotten. It was to the\r\nhonor of Henry Clay that he inspired this sentiment in such men, and it\r\nwas to their honor that they maintained it so truly. Kindred to truth\r\nis fidelity.\r\n\r\nAt his death, Garrett Davis was our Congressional senior, having\r\nentered the other House as early as 1839, after previous service of\r\nsix years in the Legislature of Kentucky. For eight years he sat as\r\nRepresentative, and then, after an interval of thirteen years, he\r\nwas for nearly twelve years Senator. During this long period he was\r\nconspicuous before the country, dwelling constantly in the public eye.\r\nHow well he stood the gaze, whether of friend or foe, belongs to his\r\ngood name.\r\n\r\nAll who knew him in the Senate will bear witness to his wonderful\r\nindustry, his perfect probity, and the personal purity of his life.\r\nNo differences of opinion can obscure the fame of these qualities, or\r\nkeep them from being a delight to his friends and an example to his\r\ncountry. Nor can any of us forget how, amid peculiar trials, he was\r\ncourageous in devotion to the National Union. No pressure, no appeal,\r\nno temptation, could sway him in this patriotic allegiance. That\r\nfidelity which belonged to his nature shone here as elsewhere. He was\r\nno holiday Senator, cultivating pleasure rather than duty, and he was\r\nabove all suspicion in personal conduct. Calumny could not reach him.\r\nNothing is so fierce and unreasoning as the enmities engendered by\r\npolitical antagonists; but even these never questioned that he was at\r\nall times incorruptible and pure. Let this be spoken in his honor; let\r\nit be written on his monument. Nor can the State that gave him to the\r\nnational service and trusted him so long fail to remember with pride\r\nthat he was always an honest man.\r\n\r\nWith this completeness of integrity there was a certain wild\r\nindependence and intensity of nature which made him unaccommodating and\r\nirrepressible. Faithful, constant, devoted, indefatigable, implacable,\r\nhe knew not how to capitulate. Dr. Johnson, who liked “a good\r\nhater,”[227] would have welcomed him into this questionable fellowship.\r\nHere I cannot doubt. Better far the opposite character, and even the\r\nerrors that may come from it. Kindred to hate is prejudice, which was\r\ntoo often active in him, seeming at times, especially where we differed\r\nfrom him, to take the place of reason. On nothing was this so marked\r\nas Slavery. Here his convictions were undisguised; nor did they yield\r\nto argument or the logic of events. How much of valuable time, learned\r\nresearch, and intellectual effort he bestowed in support of this dying\r\ncause, the chronicles of the Senate attest. How often have we listened\r\nwith pain to this advocacy, regretting deeply that the gifts he\r\npossessed, and especially his sterling character, were enlisted where\r\nour sympathies could not go! And yet I cannot doubt that others would\r\ntestify, as I now do, that never on these occasions, when the soul\r\nwas tried in its depths, did any fail to recognize the simplicity and\r\nintegrity of his nature. Had he been less honest, I should have felt\r\nhis speeches less. Happily, that great controversy is ended; nor do I\r\nsay anything but the strict truth, when I add that now we bury him who\r\nspoke last for Slavery.\r\n\r\nTime is teacher and reconciler; nor is it easy for any candid nature\r\nto preserve a constant austerity of judgment toward persons. As\r\nevening approaches, the meridian heats lose their intensity. While\r\nabiding firmly in the truth as we saw it, there may be charity and\r\nconsideration for those who did not see it as we saw it. A French\r\nstatesman, yet living, whose name is indissolubly connected with the\r\nhighest literature, as well as with some of the most important events\r\nof his age, teaches how with the passage of life the judgment is\r\nsoftened toward others. “The more,” says M. Guizot, “I have penetrated\r\ninto an understanding and experience of things, of men, and of myself,\r\nthe more I have perceived at the same time my general convictions\r\nstrengthen and my personal impressions become calm and mild. Equity,\r\nI will not say toleration for the faith of others, in religion or\r\npolitics, has come to take place and grow by the side of tranquillity\r\nin my own faith. It is youth, with its natural ignorance and passionate\r\nprejudices, which renders us exclusive and biting in our judgments of\r\nothers. In proportion as I quit myself, and as time sweeps me far from\r\nour combats, I enter without difficulty into a serene and pleasant\r\nappreciation of ideas and sentiments which do not belong to me.” Even\r\nif not adopting these words completely, all will confess their beauty.\r\n\r\nHere let me be frank. Nothing could make any speech for Slavery\r\ntolerable to me; but when I think how much opinions are determined by\r\nthe influences about us, so that a change of birth and education might\r\nhave made the Abolitionist a partisan of Slavery and the partisan of\r\nSlavery an Abolitionist, I feel, that, while always unrelenting toward\r\nthe wrong, we cannot be insensible to individual merits. In this\r\nspirit I offer a sincere tribute to a departed Senator, who, amid the\r\nperturbations of the times, trod his way with independent step, and won\r\neven from opponents the palm of character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEQUALITY IN CIVIL RIGHTS.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO THE COMMITTEE OF ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE CELEBRATION OF THE\r\nANNIVERSARY OF EMANCIPATION IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, APRIL 16, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The long procession stopped before Mr. Sumner’s house, where one of\r\n    the bands played “Auld Lang Syne.” Arriving in front of the City\r\n    Hall of Washington, they were addressed by R. T. Greene, Esq., and\r\n    also by Hon. Frederick Douglass. Letters were read from President\r\n    Grant, Senators Anthony, Pratt, and Sumner, Hon.’s Horace Maynard,\r\n    B. F. Butler, A. G. Riddle, S. J. Bowen, N. G. Ordway, and A. M.\r\n    Clapp. Mr. Sumner’s letter was as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                            WASHINGTON, April 16, 1873.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,--I regret that it is not in my power to be with you\r\n  according to the invitation with which you have honored me. This is a\r\n  day whose associations are as precious to me as to you.\r\n\r\n  Emancipation in the national capital was the experiment which\r\n  prepared the way for Emancipation everywhere throughout the country.\r\n  It was the beginning of the great end.\r\n\r\n  Here, as in other things, you are an example to our colored\r\n  fellow-citizens in the States. Your success here will vindicate the\r\n  capacity of colored people for citizenship, and your whole race will\r\n  be benefited thereby.\r\n\r\n  Let me speak frankly. Much has been done, but more remains to be\r\n  done. The great work is not yet accomplished. Until your equality\r\n  in civil rights is assured, the pillar of your citizenship is like\r\n  the column in honor of Washington,--unfinished and imperfect. There\r\n  is constant talk of finishing that column at great cost of money,\r\n  but the first thing to be done is to finish the pillar of your\r\n  citizenship. Here I shall gladly work; but I trust that you will all\r\n  work likewise, nor be content with anything less than the whole.\r\n\r\n  Accept my thanks and best wishes, and believe me, dear Sir,\r\n\r\n      Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  TO THE CHAIRMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEQUAL RIGHTS OF COLORED FELLOW-CITIZENS IN NORMAL SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nLETTER READ AT A PUBLIC MEETING IN WASHINGTON, JUNE 22, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A proposition in the Legislature of the District of Columbia,\r\n    opening the Normal School without distinction of color, failed\r\n    through the vote of a colored member, which was the occasion of\r\n    the following letter, written in reply to an inquiry. The letter\r\n    was read by the chairman of a public meeting of colored citizens\r\n    on the evening of June 30, 1873, who said he had conferred with\r\n    distinguished gentlemen, legal and otherwise, regarding the right\r\n    of the District Legislature to pass such a bill, and all had stated\r\n    that their power was unquestionable. He had addressed a letter to\r\n    the Hon. Charles Sumner upon that question, and had received the\r\n    following reply:--\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, June 22, 1873.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,--In reply to your inquiry, I have no hesitation in saying\r\n  that in my judgment the right of the District Legislature to provide\r\n  a normal school where there shall be no distinction of color is\r\n  beyond doubt. To call it in question is simply ridiculous.\r\n\r\n  Having the right, the duty of the Legislature is clear as sunshine.\r\n  It must open the school to all, without distinction of color. Should\r\n  any persons be shut out from this right on the wretched apology of\r\n  color, I trust they will make their indignation felt by the guilty\r\n  authors of the outrage.\r\n\r\n  I write plainly, because the time has come for those who love justice\r\n  to speak out. Too long have colored fellow-citizens been deprived of\r\n  their rights; they must insist upon them.\r\n\r\n      Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT OF HAYTI AND MR. SUMNER.\r\n\r\nLETTER IN REPLY TO ONE FROM THE FORMER, JULY 4, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following is a translation of the Haytian President’s letter:--\r\n\r\n                                     REPUBLIC OF HAYTI, PORT-AU-PRINCE,\r\n                                                    September 24, 1872.\r\n\r\n                                      Sixty-Ninth Year of Independence.\r\n\r\n        HONORABLE SENATOR,--I eagerly seize the good opportunity\r\n        offered me by the departure of our Minister, Citizen S.\r\n        Preston, to pray you to receive the testimony of my high\r\n        consideration, which does not cease to grow, by reason of the\r\n        eminent services which you render daily to the noble cause of\r\n        an oppressed people.\r\n\r\n        I should consider myself as failing in one of my most imperious\r\n        duties, if I did not express to you the sentiments of gratitude\r\n        which your name awakens in the breast of every one belonging to\r\n        the African race.\r\n\r\n        In assuming the defence of the rights of this people, guided by\r\n        the most generous sentiments of your rich nature, by a sincere\r\n        love of justice, you have acquired an immortal title to the\r\n        gratitude of all the descendants of the African race.\r\n\r\n        Please to receive this feeble expression of my high esteem for\r\n        the noble character of an illustrious citizen, and believe in\r\n        the depth of sentiment with which I declare myself, Honorable\r\n        Senator,\r\n\r\n            Your devoted friend,\r\n\r\n                NISAGE SAGET.\r\n\r\nMR. SUMNER’S REPLY.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, July 4, 1873.\r\n\r\n  MR. PRESIDENT,--I cannot, at this late day, acknowledge the letter\r\n  with which you have honored me, without explaining the reason of my\r\n  delay.\r\n\r\n  Owing to absence in Europe, where I had gone for my health, I did not\r\n  receive your valuable communication until some time in the winter,\r\n  when it was put into my hands by your excellent Minister. Continuing\r\n  feeble in health, I reluctantly postponed this acknowledgment. I now\r\n  take advantage of convalescence to do, thus tardily, what my feelings\r\n  prompted at an earlier day.\r\n\r\n  Please, Sir, accept my thanks for your generous appreciation of what\r\n  I have done, and your kindness in letting me know it under your own\r\n  hand. But I beg you to understand that I do not deserve the praise\r\n  with which you honor me. In advocating the cause of an oppressed\r\n  people I have only acted according to my conscience. I could not have\r\n  done otherwise; and now my only regret is that I have done so little.\r\n  I wish I had done more.\r\n\r\n  In the history of mankind the crime against the African race will\r\n  stand forth in terrible eminence,--always observed, and never\r\n  forgotten. Just in proportion as civilization prevails will this\r\n  enormous wrong be apparent in its true character; and men will read\r\n  with astonishment how human beings, guilty only of being black,\r\n  were sold into slavery, and then (such was the continuing injustice\r\n  towards this unhappy people) how, when slavery ceased, they were\r\n  still treated with indignity by persons whose lordly pretensions were\r\n  founded on the skin only. As these things are seen in increasing\r\n  light, they will be condemned in no uncertain words; nor will the\r\n  denial of equal rights, on account of color, escape the judgment\r\n  awarded to slavery itself. Human conduct on this question is a\r\n  measure of character. Where the African race is enslaved or degraded,\r\n  where it is exposed to any indignity or shut out from that equality\r\n  which is a primal right to humanity, there civilization is still\r\n  feeble.\r\n\r\n  To the certain triumph of civilization I look with constant hope. It\r\n  is sure to come; and one sign of its arrival will be that prevailing\r\n  sentiment which recognizes the perpetual obligations of equal justice\r\n  to all, and the duty to repair past wrongs by compensations in the\r\n  future.\r\n\r\n  In the great debt of the whites to the blacks there is a bank from\r\n  which, for generations to come, the latter can draw.\r\n\r\n  Accept, Mr. President, the expression of my ardent hope for the\r\n  peace, prosperity, and happiness of the Republic of Hayti, and allow\r\n  me to subscribe myself with true regard,\r\n\r\n      Your faithful friend,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF HAYTI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO HENRY RICHARD, M. P., ON THE VOTE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS\r\nAGREEING TO HIS MOTION FOR AN ADDRESS TO THE QUEEN, PRAYING\r\nCOMMUNICATION WITH FOREIGN POWERS WITH A VIEW TO A GENERAL AND\r\nPERMANENT SYSTEM OF INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION, JULY 10, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              UNITED STATES SENATE CHAMBER, WASHINGTON,\r\n                                                         July 10, 1873.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR,--Few events have given me more pleasure than the vote on\r\n  your motion. I thank you for making the motion; and I thank you also\r\n  for not yielding to Mr. Gladstone’s request to withdraw it. You were\r\n  in the very position of Buxton on his motion against Slavery. He,\r\n  too, insisted upon a division; and that vote led to Emancipation. May\r\n  you have equal success!\r\n\r\n  I anticipate much from this vote. It will draw attention on the\r\n  Continent, which the facts and figures of your speech will confirm.\r\n\r\n  I find in your speech grand compensation for the long postponement to\r\n  which you have been constrained. It marks an epoch in a great cause.\r\n  I know you will not rest. But this speech alone, with the signal\r\n  result, will make your Parliamentary life historic. Surely Mr.\r\n  Gladstone acted under some imagined exigency of politics. He cannot,\r\n  in his soul, differ from you. Honoring him much, I regret that he has\r\n  allowed himself to appear on the wrong side. What fame so great as\r\n  his, if he would devote the just influence of his lofty position to\r\n  securing for nations the inappreciable benefits of a tribunal for the\r\n  settlement of their differences!\r\n\r\n  How absurd to call your motion Utopian, if by this word is meant that\r\n  it is not practical. There is no question so supremely practical;\r\n  for it concerns not merely one nation, but every nation; and even\r\n  its discussion promises to diminish the terrible chances of war. Its\r\n  triumph would be the greatest reform of history. And I doubt not that\r\n  this day is near.\r\n\r\n  Accept my thanks and congratulations, and believe me, my dear Sir,\r\n\r\n      Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  HENRY RICHARD, ESQ., M.P., LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA COMMON-SCHOOL SYSTEM IRRESPECTIVE OF COLOR.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO THE COLORED CITIZENS OF WASHINGTON, JULY 29, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, July 29, 1873.\r\n\r\n  GENTLEMEN,--I am honored by your communication of July 26th, in\r\n  which, after congratulating me upon returning health, and expressing\r\n  your sincere hopes that I may resume my labors in the Senate, there\r\n  to take up again the cause of Equal Rights, you mention that the\r\n  colored citizens of Washington are now engaged in agitating what you\r\n  properly call “a common-school system for all children.”\r\n\r\n  I desire to thank you for the good-will to myself which your\r\n  communication exhibits, and for your hopes that I may again in the\r\n  Senate take up the cause of Equal Rights. Health itself is valuable\r\n  only as it enables us to perform the duties of life, and I know no\r\n  present duty more commanding than that to which you refer.\r\n\r\n  I confess a true pleasure in learning that the colored people are\r\n  at last rising to take the good cause into their own hands, because\r\n  through them its triumph is certain. But they must be in earnest.\r\n  They must insist and labor, then labor and insist again. Only in\r\n  this way can indifference, which is worse even than the stubbornness\r\n  of opposition, be overcome. The open foe can be met. It is hard to\r\n  deal with that dulness which feels no throb at the thought of opening\r\n  to all complete equality in the pursuit of happiness.\r\n\r\n  Permit me to remind you, Gentlemen, that, living at the national\r\n  capital, you have a peculiar responsibility. In the warfare for\r\n  Equal Rights you are the advance guard, sometimes the forlorn hope.\r\n  You are animated to move forward, not only for your own immediate\r\n  good, but because through you the whole colored population of the\r\n  country will be benefited. What is secured for you will be secured\r\n  for all,--while, if you fail, there is small hope elsewhere. Do not\r\n  forget--and let this thought arouse to increased exertion--that your\r\n  triumph will redound to the good of all.\r\n\r\n  The District of Columbia is the place where all the great reforms\r\n  born of the war have begun. It is the experimental garden and nursery\r\n  where all the generous plants have been tried. Emancipation, colored\r\n  suffrage, the right of colored persons to testify, and the right to\r\n  ride in the street-cars,--all these began here, and I remember well\r\n  how they were all encountered.\r\n\r\n  On the abolition of Slavery we were solemnly warned that riot,\r\n  confusion, and chaos would ensue. Emancipation took place, and not a\r\n  voice or sound was heard except of peace and gladness. I was soberly\r\n  assured by eminent politicians, that if colored persons were allowed\r\n  to vote there would be massacre at the polls. Then, again, colored\r\n  testimony was deprecated,--while it was insisted that the street-cars\r\n  would be ruined, if opened to colored persons. But all these changes,\r\n  demanded by simple justice, have been in every way beneficent.\r\n  Nobody would reverse them now. Who would establish Slavery again? Who\r\n  would drive the colored citizen from the polls? Who would exclude\r\n  him from the court-room? Who would shut him from the street-cars?\r\n  And now the old objections are revived, and made to do service\r\n  again, in order to defeat the effort for common schools,--being\r\n  schools founded on the very principle of Equal Rights recognized in\r\n  the elective franchise, in the court-room, and in the street-car.\r\n  If this principle is just for all the latter,--and nobody says the\r\n  contrary now,--why hesitate to apply it in education? How often we\r\n  are enjoined to train the child in the way he should go! Why, then,\r\n  compel him in those tender years to bear the ban of exclusion? Why,\r\n  at that early period, when impressions are received for life, impose\r\n  upon him the badge of inferiority? He is to be a man; therefore he\r\n  must be trained to that self-respect without which there can be no\r\n  true manhood. But this can be only by removing all ban of exclusion,\r\n  and every badge of inferiority from color.\r\n\r\n  As the old objections are revived, so again do I present the great\r\n  truth announced by our fathers in the Declaration of Independence,\r\n  “that all men are created equal.” Admitting this principle as a\r\n  rule of conduct, the separation of children in the public schools\r\n  on account of color is absolutely indefensible. In abolishing it we\r\n  simply bring our schools into conformity with the requirements of the\r\n  Declaration.\r\n\r\n  To the objection that this change will injure the schools, I reply\r\n  that this is contrary to experience in other places, where the\r\n  commingling of children according to the genius of republican\r\n  institutions has been found excellent in influence. And I further\r\n  reply by insisting now, as I always do, upon that justice to an\r\n  oppressed race which has been too long delayed, and which never fails\r\n  to be a well-spring of strength and happiness, blessing all who help\r\n  it and all who receive it.\r\n\r\n  Feeling as I do on this question, you will understand that I cannot\r\n  see without regret any opportunity neglected of advancing the cause,\r\n  especially among colored fellow-citizens. On this they should be a\r\n  unit. Wherever the question presents itself, whether in Congress, or\r\n  the Legislative Chambers of the District, or the popular assembly,\r\n  there should be a solid vote against every discrimination on account\r\n  of color. It is easy for lawyers and politicians to find excuses\r\n  according to their desires; but no fine-spun theory or technicality\r\n  should be allowed to prevail against the commanding principle.\r\n\r\n  Accept my best wishes, and believe me, Gentlemen,\r\n\r\n      Your faithful friend,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  HENRY PIPER, Chairman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOSTON: ITS PROPER BOUNDARIES.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO HON. G. W. WARREN, OF CHARLESTOWN, ON THE ANNEXION TO BOSTON\r\nOF THE SUBURBAN TOWNS, OCTOBER 4, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       COOLIDGE HOUSE, October 4, 1873.\r\n\r\n  DEAR MR. WARREN,--I should be glad to meet your friends in a\r\n  conference on the question, How Boston shall be rounded so as\r\n  to be in reality itself. I cannot meet with you, but I unite in\r\n  your purpose, as I understand it, and especially with regard to\r\n  Charlestown.\r\n\r\n  I doubt if the future Boston will be content until it holds and\r\n  possesses all the territory which hugs the harbor bearing its name,\r\n  so that in Boston harbor nobody shall land except in Boston.\r\n\r\n  Evidently Boston should contain all Bostonians, which it does not\r\n  now. I know no better way of accomplishing this result than by\r\n  widening the circle of its jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n  But there is a stronger reason. Every capital is a natural focus\r\n  of life, politically, socially, and commercially; and every person\r\n  living in this natural focus properly belongs to the capital. So it\r\n  is with London, Paris, and Vienna,--each of which is composed of\r\n  suburbs and faubourgs grouped about the original city; and so in\r\n  reality it is with Boston,--for the places about the city, though\r\n  called by different names, are parts of the same unity, which needs\r\n  nothing now but a common name.\r\n\r\n  A capital may be artificial or natural. The artificial body is\r\n  that formed by original unchangeable boundaries. The natural body\r\n  is that combination, cluster, or expansion which changes with the\r\n  developments of time and to meet the growing exigencies.\r\n\r\n  With these views, I find the various processes of annexion only a\r\n  natural manifestation, to be encouraged always, and to be welcomed\r\n  under proper conditions of population and public opinion. I say\r\n  “annexion” rather than “annexation.” Where a word is so much used,\r\n  better save a syllable,--especially as the shorter is the better.\r\n\r\n      Ever sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n    This letter appeared just previously to the vote on the\r\n    annexion to Boston of Charlestown, West Roxbury, Brighton, and\r\n    Brookline,--which was taken on the first Tuesday of October, 1873,\r\n    with a favorable result as to the first three municipalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW FEVER AT MEMPHIS AND SHREVEPORT: AID FOR THE SUFFERERS.\r\n\r\nREMARKS BEFORE THE BOARD OF TRADE AT BOSTON, OCTOBER 24, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n    At a meeting in aid of the sufferers by yellow fever in Memphis\r\n    (Tennessee) and Shreveport (Louisiana), held at the rooms of the\r\n    Board of Trade in Boston, at which the Mayor, Hon. Henry L. Pierce,\r\n    presided, after remarks by Mr. Pierce and Hon. Alexander H. Rice,\r\n    Mr. Sumner said:--\r\n\r\nMR. MAYOR,--I have come less for speech than to show by my presence\r\nhere the sincere interest I feel in the present meeting. For what can I\r\nsay to prompt the generosity of Boston merchants? They understand this\r\ncall, and their hearts have already answered it.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to hear of suffering anywhere without longing to relieve\r\nit. But happily now all impediment of distance is removed; and such\r\nare the facilities of communication that before the set of sun your\r\ncontributions will brighten the faces of those distant sufferers. Do\r\nnot think of distance. It is nothing. If Boston should be startled by\r\nhearing to-day that pestilence had appeared in one of our new-found\r\npossessions, as in Charlestown,--or even in Brookline, which will not\r\nbe annexed,--we should feel the ties of neighborhood. But Memphis\r\nand Shreveport are neighbors by telegraph and steam, and the grander\r\nties of a common country, which the ancient Roman orator called the\r\n“great charity comprehending all.”[228] Besides, there is that other\r\nmore touching neighborhood which springs from suffering,--for I do not\r\nforget the divine hymn which teaches that\r\n\r\n    “Our neighbor is the suffering man,\r\n    Though at the farthest pole.”[229]\r\n\r\nIn these latter days, my friends, distress has come less from\r\npestilence than from conflagration. The Fire Fiend has been more active\r\nthan the other demon, and property has suffered more than life. Such\r\nare the favoring conditions of climate and the general security of\r\nhealth in our country, that we are rarely disturbed by contagion. But\r\nit has come at last with the “reaper whose name is Death.”\r\n\r\nTo arrest this contagion, to help those exposed to its ravages, we\r\nperform a simple duty, as when we direct water upon the bursting\r\nblaze. Pestilence is a conflagration, and human life is the sacrifice.\r\nIn this illustration I bring home to Boston merchants the urgency of\r\nthe present call. Too well you know the terrible scene, when your\r\nmagnificent and well-filled warehouses, borrowed in style and form from\r\nVenetian palaces, were seized and devoured by the flames. But other\r\nflames, not less vindictive, are now seizing and devouring fellow-men,\r\nour fellow-countrymen, in fair and beautiful places where all smiles\r\nbut the benefactor Health. Let us do what we can to help the benefactor\r\nresume his sway.\r\n\r\n    At the close of Mr. Sumner’s remarks, measures were taken for the\r\n    immediate receiving of subscriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CASE OF THE VIRGINIUS.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO THE CUBAN MASS MEETING IN NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 15, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Virginius, a steamer sailing from New York under American\r\n    colors, was seized on her way from Jamaica to Cuba by a Spanish\r\n    cruiser, the Tornado, on the ground that she was carrying men\r\n    and munitions of war to the Cuban insurgents, and a large number\r\n    of those on board were summarily executed by order of the\r\n    Spanish authorities in that island. The intelligence caused much\r\n    excitement, especially in the City of New York, which was the\r\n    centre of Cuban interests in this country. An indignation meeting\r\n    was held in that City, which was countenanced by persons of high\r\n    character and position, and addressed by Hon. William M. Evarts and\r\n    others in speeches of great intensity. Mr. Sumner, taking a view of\r\n    the case which the sober second thought of the people approved, but\r\n    which was not in accord with the passions of the hour, answered an\r\n    invitation to attend the meeting by the following letter:--\r\n\r\n                                             BOSTON, November 15, 1873.\r\n\r\n  GENTLEMEN,--It is not in my power to be with you at your meeting to\r\n  ask for justice in Cuba.\r\n\r\n  Allow me to add, that, longing for immediate Emancipation in this\r\n  neighboring island, where Slavery still shows its infamous front, and\r\n  always insisting that delay is contrary to justice, I do not think\r\n  it practicable at this moment, on existing evidence, to determine\r\n  all our duties in the recent case where civilization has received a\r\n  shock.\r\n\r\n  It is very easy to see that no indignation at dreadful\r\n  butchery--inconsistent with the spirit of the age, but unhappily\r\n  aroused by an illicit filibustering expedition from our own shores,\r\n  kindred to that of the Alabama, for which England has been justly\r\n  condemned in damages--can make us forget that we are dealing with the\r\n  Spanish nation, struggling under terrible difficulties to become a\r\n  sister Republic, and therefore deserving from us present forbearance\r\n  and candor. Nor can we forget the noble President, whose eloquent\r\n  voice, pleading for humanity and invoking our example, has so often\r\n  charmed the world. The Spanish Republic and Emilio Castelar do not\r\n  deserve the menace of war from us.\r\n\r\n  If watchwords are needed now, let them be: Immediate Emancipation\r\n  and Justice in Cuba!--Success to the Spanish Republic!--Honor and\r\n  Gratitude to Emilio Castelar! and Peace between our two Nations!\r\n  Bearing these in mind, there will be no occasion for the belligerent\r\n  preparations of the last few days, adding to our present burdensome\r\n  expenditures several millions of dollars, and creating a war fever to\r\n  interfere with the general health of the political body.\r\n\r\n  I am, Gentlemen,\r\n\r\n      Your faithful servant,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  TO THE COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUPPLEMENTARY CIVIL-RIGHTS BILL AGAIN: IMMEDIATE ACTION URGED.\r\n\r\nREMARKS IN THE SENATE, DECEMBER 2, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT,--If the Senate has no business before it, I think it\r\ncannot do better than to proceed to the consideration of Senate bill\r\nNo. 1, the Bill Supplementary to the Civil-Rights Act.[230] It is a\r\nwell-known bill, and I do not see how it will require any debate. I\r\nthink its reading will be enough. Its terms are expressive; the bill\r\nproves itself. I move that the Senate proceed to its consideration.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ferry, of Connecticut, objecting, that on the introduction of\r\n    this bill, the day before, Mr. Edmunds, of Vermont, who was not\r\n    now in his seat, had expressed an earnest desire that it should be\r\n    referred to a committee, a feeling in which he himself sympathized,\r\n    “especially because the constitutional question which was prominent\r\n    in the former debate on it had been submitted to the consideration\r\n    of the Supreme Court of the United States, and its decision\r\n    promulgated since the Senate last met,”--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Mr. Sumner replied:--\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT,--This bill has been before a committee. What the\r\ncommittee did in the way of consideration I know not; I had not the\r\nhonor of being a member of it. But afterward, as all know, this bill\r\nwas completely, most thoroughly, considered and canvassed in this\r\nChamber. Never in the history of our legislation was any bill more\r\nconsidered; never has any bill been more minutely matured. Why, then,\r\nrefer it to a committee? I do not say that Senators propose delay, but\r\nit is obvious that such a reference will cause delay.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, I am against delay in the enactment of this measure. It\r\nshould pass promptly. It is a great act of justice, to which, as I\r\nunderstand, the political parties of the country, in solemn convention,\r\nare pledged. Why, then, wait? Why charge a committee with this burden?\r\nWhy continue on the country the burden of the injustice which this bill\r\nproposes to relieve?\r\n\r\nWe are reminded of a recent decision of the Supreme Court. I have yet\r\nto learn how that decision has any practical bearing on the present\r\nbill. I do not believe that it touches it. Why, then, interpose this\r\ndelay? Why not go forward promptly, swiftly, according to the merits of\r\nthis measure, and give it, like a benediction, to the land? Here are\r\nour colored fellow-citizens, many millions strong, all of whom have\r\nvotes, and all unite in asking it. Your table has literally groaned\r\nunder petitions presented from month to month, from year to year;\r\nand unless the bill is speedily passed, I predict that your table\r\nwill groan again with similar petitions, and justly,--for our colored\r\nfellow-citizens ought to exercise that great right of petition in favor\r\nof this measure until it is finally adopted.\r\n\r\nI am sorry that the suggestion has been made. I had hoped that there\r\nwould be nothing but welcome and consideration for a measure so truly\r\nbeneficent, and which is absolutely needed to crown and complete the\r\ngreat work of Reconstruction.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ferry reiterating his objections, with the remark that this\r\n    bill had “in its principle been considered by the Supreme Court\r\n    of the United States,” and its constitutionality “substantially\r\n    decided against,” and to Mr. Sumner’s inquiry, “When, and on what\r\n    occasion?” responding,--\r\n\r\n        “In the New Orleans Slaughter-house cases; and I have read in\r\n        the newspapers of the country during the recent vacation what\r\n        purported to be the opinion of the Supreme Court; and if the\r\n        paper which I read was the opinion of the Supreme Court, that\r\n        court, by a majority, holds in principle that the bill which\r\n        the Senator has presented is a violation of the Constitution of\r\n        the United States,”--\r\n\r\n    Mr. Sumner rejoined:--\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT,--I would not fail in any courtesy to any Senator,\r\nespecially in any courtesy to the Senator from Vermont, for whom I have\r\nall kindness and honor, but I think Senators will agree that nothing\r\npassed yesterday between us by which I am in any way constrained, so\r\nthat I may not ask the Senate to proceed at once with this bill. If I\r\ncould see the question as my friend from Connecticut sees it, he may\r\nbe assured that I should not press the bill. I do not see it so; but\r\nI do see that this bill is now on our table numbered _One_: it is the\r\nfirst bill of the Calendar. I see also that at this time the Senate has\r\nno business before it; and should I not fail in duty, if I did not ask\r\nthe Senate to proceed during this unoccupied time with a bill which I\r\nregard as so important, and which is actually the first in order, being\r\nforemost among all bills?\r\n\r\nBut my friend from Connecticut reminds me of a recent decision of\r\nthe Supreme Court. For that Court I have great respect. Personal and\r\nprofessional familiarity with the Court, and study of its judgments\r\nrunning now for much more than a generation, incline me always to\r\ndeference when its decisions are mentioned; but if I understood my\r\nfriend, he relies upon a newspaper report. Sir, I have read the\r\njudgment of that Court, communicated to me by one of its members in\r\nan official copy; and I have no hesitation in saying that the Senator\r\nis entirely mistaken, if he supposes that by a hair’s breadth it\r\ninterferes with the constitutionality of the bill which I now move.\r\n\r\nSir, there is no such lion in our path. It exists only in the\r\nimagination of my friend,--or in the desire, which he has so often\r\nmanifested, to interfere with the adoption of this measure. But\r\nthe Senator is mistaken if he supposes that I charge upon him any\r\nindifference to Human Rights. Never, in any debate, has any word fallen\r\nfrom me which that Senator can so misinterpret. I know too well his\r\nheart, his excellent and abounding nature, his New-England home, to\r\nattribute to him any such indifference. But I do know full well, for\r\nthe Senator has often declared it, that he acts under interpretations\r\nof the Constitution which it seems to me belong to the period anterior\r\nto the war rather than since the war. It seems to me--I may be\r\nmistaken, but I cannot help saying it--that the Senator has not yet\r\nrecognized that greatest of all victories by which a new interpretation\r\nis fixed upon the National Constitution, so that hereafter all its\r\nsentences, all its phrases, all its words, shall be interpreted broadly\r\nand emphatically for Human Rights. How often have I been obliged to say\r\nthis! But the Senator forgets that victory. There is his error. Most\r\nsincerely, most ardently, do I trust that the Senate will never forget\r\nit; I hope we shall duly act upon it, and celebrate it in our acts.\r\n\r\nSir, I have been betrayed into these remarks simply by way of answer\r\nto what has been said by my friend. I had hoped that this bill might\r\nbe proceeded with without debate. I had trusted that this benign\r\nmeasure was so clear and refulgent with justice that no Senator would\r\nrise in his place to oppose it. I had indulged the longing that those\r\nespecially in favor of amnesty for all would adopt that other greater\r\nand more comprehensive principle of justice for all. Strange, Sir,\r\nthat the sensibilities of so many are aroused in favor of amnesty,\r\nand yet those same Senators are so dull when the rights of men are\r\npresented! I, Sir, am anxious to see universal amnesty; but with it\r\nmust be asserted also universal justice. Our colored fellow-citizens\r\nmust be admitted to complete equality before the law. In other words,\r\neverywhere, in everything regulated by law, they must be equal with\r\nall their fellow-citizens. There is the simple principle on which\r\nthis bill stands. Who can impugn it? Who can throw upon it the shadow\r\nof question? Sir, if the Constitution of the United States does\r\nnot sanction a bill like this, then forthwith should we proceed to\r\namend that Constitution, and make it more worthy of our regard. Much\r\nas has been done, this bill must also be added to the trophies of\r\nCongressional action; this bill must be enumerated among the great\r\nresults of our recent legislation. Terrible war will then have been a\r\nbeneficent parent.\r\n\r\nI hope, Sir, there can be no question on the subject.\r\n\r\n    The motion was not agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR PILGRIM FOREFATHERS.\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT THE DINNER OF THE NEW-ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK, DECEMBER\r\n22, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n    After the customary toasts, _The Day we celebrate_, and _The\r\n    President of the United States_, the President of the Society, Mr.\r\n    Elliot C. Cowdin, in announcing the _Third Regular Toast_, said,--\r\n\r\n        “I give you, Gentlemen, _The Senate of the United States_.\r\n\r\n        “We are happy to greet, on this occasion, the senior in\r\n        consecutive service, and the most eminent member of the Senate,\r\n        whose early, varied, and distinguished services in the cause\r\n        of Freedom have made his name a household word throughout the\r\n        world,--the Honorable Charles Sumner.”\r\n\r\n    “On rising,” says the official report, “Mr. Sumner was received\r\n    with great cheering,--the members of the Society standing, waving\r\n    handkerchiefs, and in other ways expressing lively satisfaction.”\r\n\r\n    Mr. Sumner responded:--\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT AND BROTHERS OF NEW ENGLAND:--\r\n\r\nFor the first time in my life, I have the good fortune to enjoy this\r\nfamous anniversary festival. Though often honored by your most tempting\r\ninvitation, and longing to celebrate the day in this goodly company,\r\nof which all have heard so much, I could never excuse myself from\r\nduties in another place. If now I yield to well-known attractions,\r\nand journey from Washington for my first holiday during a protracted\r\npublic service, it is because all was enhanced by the appeal of your\r\nexcellent President, to whom I am bound by the friendship of many\r\nyears in Boston, New York, and in a foreign land. (_Applause._) It is\r\nmuch to be a brother of New England, but it is more to be a friend\r\n(_applause_); and this tie I have pleasure in confessing to-night.\r\n\r\nIt is with much doubt and humility that I venture to answer for the\r\nSenate of the United States, and I believe the least I say on this head\r\nwill be the most prudent. (_Laughter._) But I shall be entirely safe\r\nin expressing my doubt if there is a single Senator who would not be\r\nglad of a seat at this generous banquet. What is the Senate? It is a\r\ncomponent part of the National Government. But we celebrate to-day more\r\nthan any component part of any government. We celebrate an epoch in\r\nthe history of mankind,--not only never to be forgotten, but to grow\r\nin grandeur as the world appreciates the elements of true greatness.\r\nOf mankind, I say: for the landing on Plymouth Rock, on the 22d of\r\nDecember, 1620, marks the origin of a new order of ages, by which the\r\nwhole human family will be elevated. Then and there was the great\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nThroughout all time, from the dawn of history, men have swarmed to\r\nfound new homes in distant lands. The Tyrians, skirting Northern\r\nAfrica, stopped at Carthage; Carthaginians dotted Spain, and even the\r\ndistant coasts of Britain and Ireland; Greeks gemmed Italy and Sicily\r\nwith Art-loving settlements; Rome carried multitudinous colonies with\r\nher conquering eagles. Saxons, Danes, and Normans violently mingled\r\nwith the original Britons. And in more modern times Venice, Genoa,\r\nPortugal, Spain, France, and England, all sent forth emigrants to\r\npeople foreign shores. But in these various expeditions trade or war\r\nwas the impelling motive. Too often commerce and conquest moved hand in\r\nhand, and the colony was incarnadined with blood.\r\n\r\nOn the day we celebrate, the sun for the first time in his course\r\nlooked down upon a different scene, begun and continued under a\r\ndifferent inspiration. A few conscientious Englishmen, in obedience\r\nto the monitor within, and that they might be free to worship God\r\naccording to their own sense of duty, set sail for the unknown wilds\r\nof the North American continent. After a voyage of sixty-four days in\r\nthe ship Mayflower, with Liberty at the prow and Conscience at the\r\nhelm, (_applause_,) they sighted the white sand-banks of Cape Cod, and\r\nsoon thereafter in the small cabin framed that brief compact, forever\r\nmemorable, which is the first written constitution of government in\r\nhuman history, and the very corner-stone of the American Republic; and\r\nthen these Pilgrims landed.\r\n\r\nThis compact was not only foremost in time, it was also august in\r\ncharacter, and worthy of perpetual example. Never before had the object\r\nof the “civil body politic” been announced as “to enact, constitute,\r\nand frame such _just and equal laws_, ordinances, acts, constitutions,\r\nand offices, from time to time, as shall be thought most meet and\r\nconvenient for the general good of the Colony.”[231] How lofty! how\r\ntrue! Undoubtedly these were the grandest words of government, with the\r\nlargest promise, of any at that time uttered.\r\n\r\nIf more were needed to illustrate the new epoch, it would be found in\r\nthe parting words of the venerable pastor, John Robinson, addressed\r\nto the Pilgrims, as they were about to sail from Delft-Haven,--words\r\noften quoted, yet never enough. How sweetly and beautifully he says:\r\n“And if God should reveal anything to you by any other instrument of\r\nHis, be as ready to receive it as ever you were to receive any truth\r\nby my ministry; for I am very confident the Lord hath more truth and\r\nlight yet to break forth out of His Holy Word.” And then how justly the\r\ngood preacher rebukes those who close their souls to truth! “As, for\r\nexample, the Lutherans, they cannot be drawn to go beyond what Luther\r\nsaw,--for, whatever part of God’s will He hath further imparted and\r\nrevealed to Calvin, they will rather die than embrace it; and so also\r\nyou see the Calvinists, they stick where he left them,--a misery much\r\nto be lamented; for, though they were precious shining lights in their\r\ntimes, yet God had not revealed His whole will to them.”[232] Beyond\r\nthe merited rebuke, here is a plain recognition of the law of Human\r\nProgress, little discerned at the time, which teaches the sure advance\r\nof the Human Family, and opens the vista of the ever-broadening,\r\nnever-ending future on earth.\r\n\r\nOur Pilgrims were few and poor. The whole outfit of this historic\r\nvoyage, including £1,700 of trading-stock, was only £2,400;[233]\r\nand how little was required for their succor appears in the\r\nexperience of the soldier Captain Miles Standish, who, being sent\r\nto England for assistance,--not military, but financial (God save\r\nthe mark!),--succeeded in borrowing (how much do you suppose?) £150\r\nsterling. (_Laughter._) Something in the way of help; and the historian\r\nadds, “though at fifty per cent” interest.[234] So much for a valiant\r\nsoldier on a financial expedition. (_Laughter, in which General Sherman\r\nand the company joined._) A later agent, Allerton, was able to borrow\r\nfor the Colony £200 at a reduced interest of thirty per cent.[235]\r\nPlainly, the money-sharks of our day may trace an undoubted pedigree\r\nto these London merchants. (_Laughter._) But I know not if any son of\r\nNew England, oppressed by exorbitant interest, will be consoled by the\r\nthought that the Pilgrims paid the same.\r\n\r\nAnd yet this small people,--so obscure and outcast in condition,--so\r\nslender in numbers and in means,--so entirely unknown to the proud and\r\ngreat,--so absolutely without name in contemporary records,--whose\r\ndeparture from the Old World took little more than the breath of\r\ntheir bodies,--are now illustrious beyond the lot of men; and the\r\nMayflower is immortal beyond the Grecian Argo, or the stately ship\r\nof any victorious admiral. Though this was little foreseen in their\r\nday, it is plain now how it has come to pass. The highest greatness,\r\nsurviving time and storm, is that which proceeds from the soul of\r\nman. (_Applause._) Monarchs and cabinets, generals and admirals, with\r\nthe pomp of courts and the circumstance of war, in the gradual lapse\r\nof time disappear from sight; but the pioneers of Truth, though poor\r\nand lowly, especially those whose example elevates human nature and\r\nteaches the rights of man, so that Government of the people, by the\r\npeople, and for the people shall not perish from the earth (_great\r\napplause_),--such harbingers can never be forgotten, and their renown\r\nspreads coëxtensive with the cause they served.\r\n\r\nI know not if any whom I now have the honor of addressing have thought\r\nto recall the great in rank and power filling the gaze of the world as\r\nthe Mayflower with her company fared forth on their venturous voyage.\r\nThe foolish James was yet on the English throne, glorying that he\r\nhad “soundly peppered off the Puritans.”[236] The morose Louis the\r\nThirteenth, through whom Richelieu ruled, was King of France. The\r\nimbecile Philip the Third swayed Spain and the Indies. The persecuting\r\nFerdinand the Second, tormentor of Protestants, was Emperor of Germany.\r\nPaul the Fifth, of the House of Borghese, was Pope of Rome. In the\r\nsame princely company, and all contemporaries, were Christian the\r\nFourth, King of Denmark, and his son Christian, Prince of Norway;\r\nGustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden; Sigismund the Third, King of Poland;\r\nFrederick, King of Bohemia, with his wife, the unhappy Elizabeth of\r\nEngland, progenitor of the House of Hanover; George William, Margrave\r\nof Brandenburg, and ancestor of the Prussian house that has given an\r\nemperor to Germany; Maximilian, Duke of Bavaria; Maurice, Landgrave\r\nof Hesse; Christian, Duke of Brunswick and Luneburg; John Frederick,\r\nDuke of Würtemberg and Teck; John, Count of Nassau; Henry, Duke of\r\nLorraine; Albert, Archduke of Austria, and his wife Isabella, Infanta\r\nof Spain, joint rulers of the Low Countries; Maurice, fourth Prince\r\nof Orange, of the House of Nassau; Charles Emanuel, Duke of Savoy,\r\nand ancestor of the King of United Italy; Cosmo de’ Medici, fourth\r\nGrand Duke of Tuscany; Antonio Priuli, ninety-fifth Doge of Venice,\r\njust after the terrible tragedy commemorated on the English stage as\r\n“Venice Preserved”; Bethlen Gabor, Prince of Unitarian Transylvania,\r\nand elected King of Hungary with the countenance of an African; and the\r\nSultan Osman the Second, of Constantinople, eighteenth ruler of the\r\nTurks.\r\n\r\nSuch at that time were the crowned sovereigns of Europe, whose names\r\nwere mentioned always with awe, and whose countenances are handed down\r\nby Art, so that at this day they are visible to the curious as if they\r\nwalked these streets. Mark now the contrast. There was no artist for\r\nour forefathers, nor are their countenances now known to men; but more\r\nthan any powerful contemporaries at whose tread the earth trembled\r\nis their memory sacred. (_Applause._) Pope, emperor, king, sultan,\r\ngrand-duke, duke, doge, margrave, landgrave, count,--what are they all\r\nby the side of the humble company that landed on Plymouth Rock? Theirs,\r\nindeed, were the ensigns of worldly power; but our Pilgrims had in\r\nthemselves that inborn virtue which was more than all else besides, and\r\ntheir landing was an epoch.\r\n\r\nWho in the imposing troop of worldly grandeur is now remembered but\r\nwith indifference or contempt? If I except Gustavus Adolphus, it is\r\nbecause he revealed a superior character. Confront the Mayflower and\r\nthe Pilgrims with the potentates who occupied such space in the world.\r\nThe former are ascending into the firmament, there to shine forever,\r\nwhile the latter have been long dropping into the darkness of oblivion,\r\nto be brought forth only to point a moral or to illustrate the fame\r\nof contemporaries whom they regarded not. (_Applause._) Do I err in\r\nsupposing this an illustration of the supremacy which belongs to the\r\ntriumphs of the moral nature? At first impeded or postponed, they\r\nat last prevail. Theirs is a brightness which, breaking through all\r\nclouds, will shine forth with ever-increasing splendor.\r\n\r\nI have often thought, that if I were a preacher, if I had the honor to\r\noccupy the pulpit so grandly filled by my friend near me, (_gracefully\r\ninclining toward Mr. Beecher_,) one of my sermons should be from the\r\ntext, “A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.”[237] Nor do I know a\r\nbetter illustration of these words than the influence exerted by our\r\nPilgrims. That small band, with the lesson of self-sacrifice, of just\r\nand equal laws, of the government of a majority, of unshrinking loyalty\r\nto principle, is now leavening this whole continent, and in the fulness\r\nof time will leaven the world. (_Great applause._) By their example\r\nrepublican institutions have been commended; and in proportion as we\r\nimitate them will these institutions be assured. (_Applause._)\r\n\r\nLiberty, which we so much covet, is not a solitary plant. Always by its\r\nside is Justice. (_Applause._) Yet Justice is nothing but Right applied\r\nto human affairs. Do not forget, I entreat you, that with the highest\r\nmorality is the highest liberty. A great poet, in one of his inspired\r\nsonnets, speaking of this priceless possession, has said,\r\n\r\n    “For who loves that must first be wise and good.”[238]\r\n\r\nTherefore do the Pilgrims in their beautiful example teach liberty,\r\nteach republican institutions,--as at an earlier day Socrates and\r\nPlato, in their lessons of wisdom, taught liberty and helped the idea\r\nof the republic. If republican government has thus far failed in any\r\nexperiment, as, perhaps, somewhere in Spanish America, it is because\r\nthese lessons have been wanting; there have been no Pilgrims to teach\r\nthe Moral Law.\r\n\r\nMr. President, with these thoughts, which I imperfectly express, I\r\nconfess my obligations to the forefathers of New England, and offer\r\nto them the homage of a grateful heart. But not in thanksgiving only\r\nwould I celebrate their memory. I would, if I could, make their example\r\na universal lesson, and stamp it upon the land. (_Applause._) The\r\nconscience which directed them should be the guide for our public\r\ncouncils; the just and equal laws which they required should be\r\nordained by us; and the hospitality to Truth which was their rule\r\nshould be ours. Nor would I forget their courage and steadfastness. Had\r\nthey turned back or wavered, I know not what would have been the record\r\nof this continent, but I see clearly that a great example would have\r\nbeen lost. (_Applause._) Had Columbus yielded to his mutinous crew and\r\nreturned to Spain without his great discovery, had Washington shrunk\r\naway disheartened by British power and the snows of New Jersey, these\r\ngreat instances would have been wanting for the encouragement of men.\r\nBut our Pilgrims belong to the same heroic company, and their example\r\nis not less precious. (_Applause._)\r\n\r\nOnly a short time after the landing on Plymouth Rock, the great\r\nrepublican poet, John Milton, wrote his “Comus,” so wonderful for\r\nbeauty and truth. His nature was more refined than that of the\r\nPilgrims; and yet it requires little effort of imagination to catch\r\nfrom one of them, or at least from their beloved pastor, the exquisite,\r\nalmost angelic words at the close:--\r\n\r\n    “Mortals, that would follow me,\r\n    Love Virtue: she alone is free;\r\n    She can teach ye how to climb\r\n    Higher than the sphery chime:\r\n    Or if Virtue feeble were,\r\n    Heaven itself would stoop to her.”\r\n\r\n    “At the conclusion of Senator Sumner’s speech,” says the report,\r\n    “the audience rose and gave cheer upon cheer.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY CIVIL-RIGHTS BILL: THE LAST APPEAL.\r\n\r\nREMARKS IN THE SENATE, JANUARY 27, 1874.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Supplementary Civil-Rights Bill, introduced by Mr. Sumner on\r\n    the first day of the Session, having now come up for consideration,\r\n    and the question being on a motion by Mr. Ferry, of Connecticut, to\r\n    refer it to the Committee on the Judiciary, Mr. Sumner said:--\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT,--There is a very good reason, a very strong reason, why\r\nthis bill should not be referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and\r\nit is found in the history of the bill. I have in my hand a memorandum,\r\nwhich has been kindly prepared for me at the desk, disclosing details\r\nwhich Senators ought to bear in mind before they vote. By the Journals\r\nof the Senate it appears that as long ago as May 13, 1870,--\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Sumner asked, and by unanimous consent obtained, leave to\r\n    bring in a bill supplementary to an Act entitled ‘An Act to protect\r\n    all persons in the United States in their civil rights, and furnish\r\n    the means of their vindication,’ passed April 9, 1866; which was\r\n    read the first and second times, by unanimous consent, referred to\r\n    the Committee on the Judiciary, and ordered to be printed.”\r\n\r\nThe next appearance of the bill is July 7th, of that year, when,\r\naccording to the Journal, “Mr. Trumbull, from the Committee on the\r\nJudiciary,” with a large number of other bills reported this to the\r\nSenate, with a recommendation “that they ought not to pass.” The record\r\nsays that--\r\n\r\n    “The Senate proceeded to consider the said bills as in Committee\r\n    of the Whole; and no amendment being made, they were severally\r\n    reported to the Senate.\r\n\r\n    “On motion by Mr. Trumbull,\r\n\r\n    “_Ordered_, That the said bills be postponed indefinitely.”\r\n\r\nYou will observe, Sir, the bill was treated in the lump with others,\r\nat the close of the session; and you have here the report of the very\r\ncommittee to which it is now proposed to refer it.\r\n\r\nThe next appearance of the bill is January 20, 1871, and the entry is\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Sumner asked, and by unanimous consent obtained, leave to\r\n    bring in a bill supplementary to an Act entitled ‘An Act to protect\r\n    all persons in the United States in their civil rights, and furnish\r\n    the means of their vindication,’ passed April 9, 1866; which was\r\n    read the first and second times, by unanimous consent, referred to\r\n    the Committee on the Judiciary, and ordered to be printed.”\r\n\r\nFebruary 15, 1871, “Mr. Trumbull, from the Committee on the Judiciary,\r\nto whom were referred the following bills [the present with others],\r\nreported them severally without amendment, and that they ought not to\r\npass.”\r\n\r\nThere was no action of the Senate at the time; for you will bear in\r\nmind the lateness of the day in the session; and Senators cannot have\r\nforgotten the pressure of business at that time. That was sufficient\r\nreason against the consideration of the bill. Indeed, with all the\r\nassiduity that I could command, I was not able to obtain a hearing for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThen came the first session of the Forty-Second Congress, beginning\r\nMarch 4, 1871. Upon the Journal it appears, March 9, 1871,--\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Sumner asked, and by unanimous consent obtained, leave to\r\n    bring in [this same bill, with one other], which were read the\r\n    first and second times, by unanimous consent, and ordered to lie on\r\n    the table and be printed.”\r\n\r\nIn introducing the bill this third time I stated that it had already\r\nbeen to the Judiciary Committee twice before; that it was to be\r\npresumed that they had carefully considered it; that they had reported\r\nit adversely; that they had not reported any amendment; that I did not\r\nthink it advisable now to refer the bill to a committee which had twice\r\nrecorded an adverse judgment; that the bill was well known to Senators;\r\nthat it had been before the Senate a long time; and that under the\r\ncircumstances I thought I should be justified in asking that it take\r\nits place on the Calendar and be printed. The order was made, and it\r\nheld its place on the Calendar.\r\n\r\nShortly afterward a measure of general amnesty, it will be remembered,\r\npassed the House of Representatives and came to this Chamber. Then it\r\nwas that I deemed it my duty to move this bill as an amendment, and you\r\nwill remember the extended discussion that ensued,--how justice to the\r\nAfrican race was contrasted with generosity to those who had struck at\r\nthe life of the Republic, and it was insisted that our first duty was\r\njustice. The debate was protracted. Senators cannot have forgotten\r\nit; and more than once votes were had upon the pending amendment. I\r\nthink it was twice carried by the casting vote of the Vice-President.\r\nCertainly it was attached to the bill for general amnesty, and the\r\ndebate reached over weeks, during which time the Supplementary\r\nCivil-Rights Bill, as it came to be called, underwent amendment. It\r\nwas modified in various particulars,--in none of great importance, in\r\nnone of principle, but verbally; also in the penalties, and in the\r\nmachinery: but the bill now stands, in principle and in substance, as\r\nit was when originally introduced. So far as it is changed, it is a\r\nchange reached by debate in this Chamber. The Senate itself has been a\r\nCommittee of the Whole sitting on this bill, superseding thereby the\r\nlabors of any special committee.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, after two references to the Judiciary Committee should we\r\nhave a third? Is it for delay? Is it in the hope of any light on this\r\nimportant subject which Senators have not already? Why, then, the\r\nreference? I can see no considerable or sufficient object, except one\r\nthat we are compelled to recognize in this Chamber: can it be a mode of\r\nopposition by interposing time, delay?\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, the bill is on the Calendar No. 1. It should have been the\r\nfirst acted upon this session; and if it was not acted upon first,\r\nthere is no blame on me, for I tried to have you act upon it on one\r\nof the earliest days of this session, but I was resisted here by the\r\nSenator from Connecticut [Mr. FERRY], and the Senator from Maine [Mr.\r\nMORRILL]; the Senator from Connecticut insisting, then as now, that the\r\nbill should go to a committee. Now, Sir, I appeal to the Senate to take\r\nthis important measure into its own hands at once and directly.\r\n\r\nWhat is the use of a Committee? It is as eyes and ears to the Senate.\r\nHow often do we repeat that saying! But who wants eyes and ears for the\r\nappreciation of this measure? Its character is manifest; its justice is\r\nconfessed; it is in harmony with all that has been done to carry out\r\nthe great results of the war; it is in harmony with the Declaration\r\nof Independence, and with the grand history of the Republic; it is in\r\nharmony with the Constitutional Amendments, and it is indeed necessary\r\nin order to their full enjoyment. The necessity is manifest every day\r\nin the outrages to which the colored race are exposed, not only in\r\ntravel and at hotels, but still more in the children of their homes,\r\nwho are shut out from those schools where they ought to receive\r\npractically, as well as by lesson, the great duty of Equality. The bill\r\nis an urgent necessity. There ought to be no delay. There should not be\r\nthe postponement of a Committee, for the Committee is unnecessary. The\r\nCommittee has already sat upon it once, twice: why a third time?\r\n\r\n    In the debate which ensued, Mr. Stewart, of Nevada, and Mr.\r\n    Edmunds, of Vermont (Chairman of the Judiciary Committee), among\r\n    others, participated, both urging the proposed reference, and the\r\n    latter in remarks replete with personality. Mr. Sumner responded as\r\n    follows:--\r\n\r\nThe Senator from Nevada has made a speech which is founded on oblivion\r\nof the past. The bill has been examined by the Judiciary Committee, and\r\ntwice reported by them adversely without amendment.\r\n\r\n    MR. EDMUNDS. When was the last report?\r\n\r\n    MR. SUMNER. February 15, 1871.\r\n\r\n    MR. EDMUNDS. That was in the time of Trumbull.\r\n\r\nMR. SUMNER. The Senator says, “That was in the time of Trumbull.” But\r\nit was reported adversely by the Judiciary Committee, of which my\r\nlearned friend was a distinguished member, I think. I cannot mistake;\r\nhe must have been on the Committee, a party to its report; and there\r\nwas from him no minority voice, no opposition on this floor to the\r\nreport of the Chairman. He allowed the Chairman to speak for the\r\nCommittee, including himself.\r\n\r\nBut the Senator from Nevada, oblivious of this history, insists upon\r\nanother reference. He wishes to put this bill through another dance.\r\nFor what purpose? He has read the existing statute to which this is\r\nsupplementary, and he thinks that the Committee ought to consider the\r\naptitude of this bill to carry out the declared purpose. Why, Sir, I\r\nagree with him that such aptitude ought to exist, but do not forget\r\nthat the bill has been before the Senate now nearly four years. Nearly\r\nfour years has this bill, substantially as at this moment, been before\r\nthe Senate, and twice before the Judiciary Committee.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, let us ascend from words to things. Why make another\r\nreference? Is it that it may find verbal place on your record that\r\nthis bill was duly referred and duly reported? That is the only reason\r\nI can imagine; for the bill in its substance is well known to every\r\nSenator, and, I may add, is well known to every lawyer in the country.\r\nIt has been discussed here again and again, day after day, and has\r\nbeen modified after discussion; and you now have the result of all\r\nthe discussion and the modification. It is well known. It is familiar\r\nto the country. It has received the approbation of those who are most\r\ninterested in it. It has been prayed for by petitioners without\r\nnumber. It has been commended at public meetings with an earnestness\r\nand an enthusiasm almost without parallel.\r\n\r\n    MR. EDMUNDS. May I ask the Senator a question?\r\n\r\n    MR. SUMNER. Certainly.\r\n\r\n    MR. EDMUNDS. I should like to ask my friend, the Senator from\r\n    Massachusetts, (as he is now speaking of the character of the bill,\r\n    which I did not care to refer to particularly,) where the jury is\r\n    summoned, and a man should happen to be convicted of murder or any\r\n    other crime under the State law, would it, or not, set aside the\r\n    verdict?\r\n\r\n    MR. SUMNER. The Senator will pardon me. I had not intended to touch\r\n    this branch of the debate.\r\n\r\n    MR. EDMUNDS. I merely wish to ask him what he understands to be the\r\n    character of the fourth section, supposing we pass it just as it\r\n    stands, and supposing a jury happens to be summoned contrary to the\r\n    provisions of the fourth section, but in accordance with the law of\r\n    the State.\r\n\r\n    MR. SUMNER. The effect of the violation of the law in that respect\r\n    need not be considered. It is sufficient that this section provides\r\n    a penalty against those who violate the law; such is its simple\r\n    object.\r\n\r\n    MR. EDMUNDS. Ah! but let me ask my friend, does it not also provide\r\n    what shall constitute a lawful jury?\r\n\r\n    MR. SUMNER. Very well,--and should it not so provide?\r\n\r\n    MR. EDMUNDS. Very well,--but my question is, What would be the\r\n    effect upon the trial of an indictment found by a grand jury not\r\n    composed in conformity to this motion?\r\n\r\nMR. SUMNER. I will not presume to pronounce an opinion on that\r\nquestion. It is sufficient for me that the section is clear and\r\nexplicit in imposing a penalty upon the party making the exclusion, and\r\nthat is all the bill proposes. The other consequences may be, will be,\r\nfor the determination of the courts. The question belongs to them; I\r\ndoubt if it belongs to us. But the bill is open to amendment. Let the\r\nSenator move such as he thinks the case requires: I shall welcome it.\r\n\r\nWhen the Senator interrupted me I was about to address myself to\r\nhim; for I should not have risen this time but for the remarks which\r\nhe made. I know not, Sir, why my position on this question should\r\njustify the personalities which the Senator from Vermont considers so\r\nessential to debate. I certainly made no allusion to him, nor do I\r\nclaim anything for myself. I am an humble worker in this Chamber, and\r\nin this cause I have been laborious for years; but not on that account\r\ndo I claim anything, nor do I make any pretence. I know not why the\r\nSenator should, with personality of manner and allusion, undertake to\r\ntaunt me for the position that I occupy. Do I deserve it? I represent\r\nhumbly the sentiments of the people of Massachusetts, who have sent me\r\nhere now for many years. Always loyal to these sentiments I hope to\r\nbe, even though it brings upon me the displeasure of the Senator. Sir,\r\nI am anxious to harmonize with that Senator. I know, too, his loyalty\r\nto this cause,--I do not doubt it; but I now appeal to that Senator to\r\nunite with me in speeding this great measure. Let him join sincerely,\r\nwith his large intelligence, to hasten this bill before the Senate\r\nand make it the law of the land; so would he become a benefactor to a\r\nmuch-oppressed people.\r\n\r\nPossibly he has his doubts in regard to the Jury provision. I know\r\nother lawyers have expressed doubts before; and from the inquiry that\r\nhe made a moment ago it is perhaps fair to infer that those doubts\r\nhaunt his mind. To that I simply answer, Happily they do not haunt\r\nmine. I know the Constitution of my country, and I know that under\r\nthat Constitution, unless my judgment fails entirely, the provision\r\nwith reference to juries is absolutely valid and constitutional.\r\nI challenge the discussion. Let the Senator make his objections.\r\nThe original Civil-Rights Bill, which passed over the veto of the\r\nPresident, solemnly declares that no evidence shall be excluded from\r\nany court of justice, National or State, on account of color. The\r\nnation has undertaken to regulate the testimony, not only in its own\r\nCourts but in State Courts; and will any one pretend that it may not\r\nregulate the jury in State Courts, when it may regulate the testimony\r\nin State Courts? Why, Sir, there is nothing in the Constitution\r\ntouching testimony, but there are no less than three distinct\r\nprovisions relating to trial by jury; and among other terms employed\r\nis “an impartial jury,” which is among the privileges and immunities\r\nof the citizen. And is it wrong for Congress, in the plenitude of its\r\npowers, anxious to do justice to all, to declare that there shall be\r\nan impartial jury in all tribunals, whether National or State, without\r\nregard to color? Having begun by regulating the testimony, where is the\r\nargument which is to prevent us from regulating the jury? I need not\r\nremind my excellent friend that originally the witnesses and the jury\r\nwere almost one and the same.\r\n\r\n    MR. EDMUNDS. They were precisely the same.\r\n\r\nMR. SUMNER. Very well,--so much the better; and the Senator knows that\r\nthere is a phrase handed down to us from English courts by which we\r\nare reminded constantly of the “witness-box” and the “jury-box.” So\r\nclosely were they together that they come under a common nomenclature.\r\nNow I insist that they shall come under a common safeguard. We have\r\nalready provided that there shall be no exclusion in testimony on\r\naccount of color: we must also provide that there shall be no exclusion\r\nfrom the jury on account of color; and until that provision is made by\r\nsupreme national law, not to be set aside, justice is not fully done.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, I had no intention to discuss the character of this bill;\r\nand I have only been led into it by the allusion of the Senator, who,\r\nholding the bill in his hand, signalizes that section as open to\r\ncriticism. Let him proceed with his criticism. But then I hope for\r\nbetter things. I hope my friend, instead of criticism, will give us\r\nthat generous support which so well becomes him. He sees full well,\r\nthat, until this great question is completely settled, the results of\r\nthe war are not all secured, nor is this delicate and sensitive subject\r\nbanished from these Halls. Sir, my desire, the darling desire, if I\r\nmay say so, of my soul, at this moment, is to close forever this great\r\nquestion, so that it shall never again intrude into these Chambers,--so\r\nthat hereafter in all our legislation there shall be no such words\r\nas “black” or “white,” but that we shall speak only of citizens and\r\nof men. Is not that an aspiration worthy of a Senator? Is such an\r\naspiration any ground for taunt from the Senator of Vermont? Will he\r\nnot, too, join in the aspiration and the endeavor to bring about that\r\nbeneficent triumph? Let this be omitted now, let any part of this bill\r\nbe dropped out now, and you leave the question for another Congress,\r\nto be pursued by other petitions, to be pressed by other Senators and\r\nRepresentatives; for, so long as injustice remains without redress, so\r\nlong will there be men to petition, and so long, I trust, will there be\r\nSenators and Representatives to demand a remedy. I ask for all now.\r\n\r\n    At length, on the representation of Mr. Frelinghuysen, of New\r\n    Jersey, that, “by acquiescing with the other friends of the measure\r\n    in its reference to the Committee on the Judiciary, the Senator\r\n    from Massachusetts has it in his power to take from every opponent\r\n    of the bill any apology, reason, or excuse for opposing it,”\r\n    followed by the declaration, “I think we can give the Senator the\r\n    assurance that a fortnight will not pass without the bill being\r\n    reported,”--\r\n\r\n    Mr. Sumner inquiring,--“The Senator is a member of the Judiciary\r\n    Committee, I believe?”\r\n\r\n        MR. FRELINGHUYSEN. Yes, Sir.\r\n\r\n        MR. SUMNER. I accept his assurance and consent to the reference.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Edmunds, Chairman of the Committee, demurring to the proposed\r\n    agreement to report the bill within two weeks, suggested as a\r\n    substitute, “its consideration with the promptness that the\r\n    business of the Committee will allow,” which Mr. Frelinghuysen\r\n    pronouncing “equally satisfactory,” it was tacitly so settled,--Mr.\r\n    Howe, of Wisconsin, thereupon observing, “I think the assurances we\r\n    have from the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from Vermont\r\n    are a sufficient guaranty that the bill will get back here in good\r\n    season.”\r\n\r\n        MR. SUMNER. And in good condition. (_Laughter._)\r\n\r\n        MR. EDMUNDS. Much better than it is now. (_Laughter._)\r\n\r\n    Mr. Morton of Indiana subsequently remarking,--\r\n\r\n        I do not myself feel that there is any great importance in\r\n        referring this bill to a committee, for the reason that the\r\n        question has been so long before the Senate and has been so\r\n        amply discussed. But still that is the usage of the Senate; we\r\n        do that with regard to all bills unless under some very strong\r\n        emergency; and if the Senator had consented in the first place\r\n        to the reference of the bill, we should have had it back long\r\n        ago. So, I think, he has nobody to blame but himself that this\r\n        bill is not now before the Senate to be acted upon. But I may\r\n        be allowed to express the hope, and I have no reason to doubt\r\n        that it will be gratified, that the Judiciary Committee will\r\n        promptly examine this bill, and report back a Civil-Rights Bill\r\n        upon which the Senate can take action before long. I think that\r\n        ought to be done for very many considerations,--\r\n\r\n    Mr. Sumner replied:--\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT,--I should not say another word, except for the ardor\r\nwith which my friend from Indiana comes forward to throw a little blame\r\non me. He thinks, that, if I had consented to an earlier reference of\r\nthis bill, it would now be in order before the Senate; but he says that\r\nin a case of strong emergency bills are not referred to committees.\r\nNow I ask the Senator from Indiana if this is not a case of strong\r\nemergency? The bill has been pending nearly four solid years, during\r\nall which time a portion of our fellow-citizens, counted by the\r\nmillion, have been exposed to indignity; and because I tried to speed\r\nthe result, hoping to bring the Senate to a generous conclusion of\r\nthe whole measure without a reference to the Committee, the Senator\r\nfrom Indiana thus tardily seeks to rebuke me. If I erred at all, it\r\nwas because I trusted the Senate. I felt, that, with this bill on the\r\nCalendar and within reach, it could not hesitate. I was unwilling to\r\nsee the bill in a committee-room, where the Senate, in a generous\r\nmoment, could not take it up any day, and, so far as the Senate was\r\nconcerned, make it the law of the land. I put too much faith in this\r\nbody, which I ought to know well. I did, Sir, have generous trust. I\r\ndid believe that at some early day the bill would be considered and\r\nadopted. I have been disappointed. More than once I have tried to reach\r\nit, I have tried to bring it before the Senate; but you know well\r\nthe impediments; you know that other important matters have occupied\r\nattention, so that I could not, with any reasonable chance of success,\r\nseek to press this important measure. That, Sir, is the occasion\r\nfor delay; and I do not think--I hardly like to make any question\r\nwith my friend--but I do not think he was generous in the imputation\r\nthat he sought to throw upon me. Had that Senator, on the first day\r\nof the session, or when I made an effort at a later day to bring it\r\nup, come forward then to aid me in pressing it on the attention of\r\nthe Senate,--had he reminded the Senate and the country how many\r\nfellow-citizens were shut out from their rights, and that a denial of\r\nrights does not allow delay,--had these words come from the Senator\r\nat that time, ah! we should have been having no such debate as has\r\noccurred to-day. The bill would have been hastened on its way, and a\r\npeople long enslaved and degraded would be at last lifted to equality.\r\n\r\n    The question being now put, the bill was referred to the Committee\r\n    on the Judiciary without objection.\r\n\r\n    March 11, 1874, Mr. Sumner died.\r\n\r\n    April 14th his bill was reported back by Mr. Frelinghuysen from the\r\n    Committee with an amendment in the form of a substitute,--being\r\n    substantially the original bill taken into a new draught, with\r\n    a few differences of machinery. In this form, after long and\r\n    exhaustive debate, it was passed in the Senate, May 22d, by Yeas\r\n    29, Nays 16.\r\n\r\n    In the House, all efforts to take it up were frustrated by the\r\n    minority, under the rule requiring a two-thirds vote for this\r\n    purpose, until the closing hours of the succeeding session, March\r\n    3, 1875, when a vote was obtained referring it to the Committee on\r\n    the Judiciary, but too late for action, and the bill fell with the\r\n    expiration of the Congress.\r\n\r\n    Meanwhile, however, February 3d, Mr. Butler, of Massachusetts,\r\n    had reported a bill from this Committee, covering the provisions\r\n    of the Senate bill, with the exception only of that relating to\r\n    cemeteries, but with the addition to that on Common Schools of the\r\n    proviso,--\r\n\r\n         “That if any State or the proper authorities in any\r\n        State, having the control of Common Schools or other public\r\n        institutions of learning aforesaid, shall establish and\r\n        maintain separate schools and institutions giving equal\r\n        educational advantages in all respects for different classes of\r\n        persons entitled to attend such schools and institutions, such\r\n        schools and institutions shall be a sufficient compliance with\r\n        the provisions of this section so far as they relate to schools\r\n        and institutions of learning.”\r\n\r\n    On proceeding to a vote, the next day, February 14th, the entire\r\n    clause, embracing Common Schools, public institutions of learning\r\n    or benevolence, and national agricultural colleges, together with\r\n    this proviso, was, on motion of Mr. Kellogg, of Connecticut, struck\r\n    out by Ayes 123, Noes 48,--a call for the Yeas and Nays, which\r\n    would have brought out the names, being refused. A previous motion\r\n    by Mr. Cessna, of Pennsylvania, to substitute the full text of the\r\n    Senate bill for that of the House Committee, now recurring, was\r\n    defeated by Yeas 114, Nays 148,--and the latter, amended as above\r\n    stated, was then passed by Yeas 162, Nays 100,--and subsequently,\r\n    February 27th, in the Senate also, by Yeas 38, Nays 26,--and March\r\n    1st received the approval of the Executive.\r\n\r\n    This bill, entitled “An Act to protect all citizens in their\r\n    civil and legal rights,”[239] has since stood on the statute\r\n    book as a finality,--these rights, in the terms of the statute,\r\n    consisting of “the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations,\r\n    advantages, facilities, and privileges of [1st] inns, [2d] public\r\n    conveyances on land or water, [3d] theatres, and other places of\r\n    public amusement”; to which another section, rising to a higher\r\n    plane, adds the declaration [4th] “That no citizen possessing all\r\n    other qualifications which are or may be prescribed by law shall\r\n    be disqualified for service as grand or petit juror in any court\r\n    of the United States, or of any State, on account of race, color,\r\n    or previous condition of servitude,”--with such security to the\r\n    colored citizens of this inestimable right as may be found in the\r\n    provision that “any officer or other person, charged with any duty\r\n    in the selection or summoning of jurors, who shall exclude or fail\r\n    to summon any citizen for the cause aforesaid, shall, on conviction\r\n    thereof, be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and be fined _not more_\r\n    than five thousand dollars.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Case of Plau, French Consul-General at New York.\r\n\r\n[2] April 30, 1864: A Bill to provide for the greater Efficiency of the\r\nCivil-Service of the United States.
