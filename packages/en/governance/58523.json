The\r\ncauses which precipitated the conflict between the sections and the\r\nmomentous events which attended the struggle have been recounted by\r\nwriters competent to the task. But descriptions of battles and civil\r\nconvulsions do not exhibit the full condition of the South in the\r\ncrisis. To complete the picture, social characteristics and incidents of\r\nprivate life are indispensable lineaments. It occurs to the author that\r\na plain and unambitious narrative of her recollections of Washington\r\nsociety during the calm which preceded the storm, and of Virginia under\r\nthe afflictions and sorrows of the fratricidal strife, will not be\r\nwithout interest in the retrospect of that memorable era. The present\r\nvolume recalls that era in the aspect in which it appeared to a woman\r\nrather than as it appeared to a statesman or a philosopher.\r\n\r\n     ROGER A.

When I knew the capital\r\nof our country, it was not \"a howling wilderness of deserted streets\r\nrunning out into the country and ending nowhere, its population\r\nconsisting chiefly of politicians and negroes\";[1] nor were the streets\r\noverrun with pigs and infested with goats. I never saw these animals in\r\nthe streets of Washington; but a story, told to illustrate the best way\r\nof disposing of the horns of a dilemma proves one goat at least to have\r\nhad the freedom of the city. It seems that Henry Clay, overdue at the\r\nSenate Chamber, was once hurrying along Pennsylvania Avenue when he was\r\nattacked by a large goat. Mr. Clay seized his adversary by the horns.\r\nSo far so good, but how about the next step? A crowd of sympathetic\r\nbootblacks and newsboys gathered around offering advice. \"Let go, Mr.\r\nClay, and run like blazes,\" shouted one; and Mr. Clay did let go and\r\ndid run, his senatorial coat-tails flying like pennons behind him.\r\n\r\nBut this was before my day. I remember Washington only as a garden of\r\ndelights, over which the spring trailed an early robe of green, thickly\r\nembroidered with gems of amethyst and ruby, pearl and sapphire. The\r\ncrocuses, hyacinths, tulips, and snowdrops made haste to bloom before\r\nthe snows had fairly melted. The trees donned their diaphanous veils of\r\ngreen earlier in the White House grounds, the lawn of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, and the gentle slopes around the Capitol, than anywhere\r\nin less distinguished localities. To walk through these incense-laden\r\ngrounds, to traverse the avenue of blossoming crab-apples, was pure\r\npleasure. The shaded avenues were delightful long lanes, where one\r\nwas sure to meet friends, and where no law of etiquette forbade a\r\npause in the public street for a few words of kindly inquiry, or a\r\nbit of gossip, or the development of some plan for future meetings. If\r\none's steps tended to the neighborhood of 7th and D streets, nothing\r\nwas more probable than a meeting with one of Washington's most noted\r\ncitizens,—the superb mastiff of Mr. Gales, the veteran editor of the\r\n_National Intelligencer_, as the dog gravely bore in a large basket\r\nthe mail for the office. No attendant was needed by this fine animal.\r\nHe was fully competent to protect his master's private and official\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\nHe had been taught to express stern disapprobation of Democrats; so if a\r\npleasant walk with him was desired, it was expedient for members of that\r\nparty to perjure themselves and at once announce: \"I am an 'Old-Line\r\nWhig,' old man,\" and the dog's tail would wag a cordial welcome.\r\n\r\nOmnibuses ran along Pennsylvania Avenue, for the convenience of\r\nSenators, Congressmen, and others on their way to the Capitol,—but the\r\nsaunter along the avenue was so charming that I always preferred it\r\nto the People's Line. There were few shops. But such shops! There was\r\nGalt's, where the silver, gems, and marbles were less attractive than\r\nthe cultivated gentleman who sold them; Gautier's, the palace of sweets,\r\nwith Mrs. Gautier in an arm-chair before her counter to tell you the\r\nprecise social status of every one of her customers, and what is more,\r\nto put you in your own; Harper's, where the dainty, leisurely salesman\r\ntreated his laces with respect, drawing up his cuffs lest they touch the\r\nethereal beauties; and the little corner shop of stern Madame Delarue,\r\nwho imported as many (and no more) hats and gloves as she was willing to\r\nsell as a favor to the ladies of the diplomatic and official circles,\r\nand whose dark-eyed daughter Léonide (named for her godmother, a Greek\r\nlady of rank) was susceptible of unreasoning friendships and could be\r\ncoaxed to preserve certain treasures for humbler folk.\r\n\r\nLéonide once awoke me in the middle of the night with a note bidding me\r\n\"come _tout de suite_,\" for \"Maman\" was asleep, the boxes had arrived;\r\nand she and I could peep at the bonnets and choose the best one for\r\nmyself. Thus it was that I once bore away a \"divine creation\" of point\r\nlace, crêpe, and shaded asters before Madame had seen it. Otherwise\r\nit would have been reserved for Miss Harriet Lane or Mrs. Douglas.\r\nMadame had to know later; and Léonide was not much in evidence the rest\r\nof that season. At Madame Delarue's, if one was very _gentil_, very\r\n_convenable_, one might have the services of François, the one and only\r\nhair-dresser of note, who had adjusted coronets on noble heads, and who\r\ncould (if he so minded) talk of them agreeably in Parisian French.\r\n\r\nAll these were little things; but do not pleasant trifles make the sum\r\nof pleasant hours? Washington was like a great village in those days of\r\nPresident Pierce and President Buchanan. To obtain the best of the few\r\narticles to be purchased was an achievement.\r\n\r\nMy own pride in the Federal City was such that my heart would swell\r\nwithin me at every glimpse of the Capitol: from the moment it rose like\r\na white cloud above the smoke and mists, as I stood on the deck of the\r\nsteamboat (having run up from my dinner to salute Mount Vernon), to\r\nthe time when I was wont to watch from my window for the sunset, that\r\nI might catch the moment when a point on the unfinished dome glowed\r\nlike a great blazing star after the sun had really gone down. No matter\r\nwhether suns rose or set, there was the star of our country,—the star\r\nof our hearts and hopes.\r\n\r\nI acknowledge that Wisdom is much to be desired of her children, but\r\nnowhere is it promised that they will be the happier for gaining her.\r\nWhen my lot was cast in Washington, Wisdom had not taught me that the\r\nWhite House was less beautiful than a classic temple. To be sure,\r\nDickens had called it \"like an English club-house,\"—that was bad\r\nenough,—but Mark Twain had not yet dubbed it \"a fine, large, white barn\r\nwith wide handsome grounds around it.\" \"The President lives there,\"\r\nsays Washington Hawkins. \"It is ugly enough outside, but that is\r\nnothing to what it is inside.\" To my uneducated eye the East Room with\r\nits ornate chandeliers, fluted pillars, and floriated carpet was an\r\naudience chamber fit for a king. A triumph of artistic perfection was\r\nthe equestrian statue of the hero of New Orleans, now known to be out\r\nof all proportion, and condemned as \"bad\" and \"very bad\" by Wisdom's\r\ninstructed children. Raising his hat, indeed! Why, any man in that\r\nposition would be holding on to the mane with both hands to keep from\r\nsliding off. And as for the Capitol—the sacred Capitol! From foundation\r\nto turret it was to my eye all that genius and patriotism could achieve.\r\nThe splendid marbles at the entrance, the paintings, the bas-reliefs\r\nwithin the rotunda,—these were things to boast of, to dream of. Not yet\r\nhad arisen our irreverent humorist to warn us never to enter the dome\r\nof the Capitol, \"because to get there you must pass through the great\r\nrotunda, and to do that you would have to see the marvellous historical\r\npaintings that hang there and the bas-reliefs,—and what have you done\r\nthat you should suffer this?\"\r\n\r\nWhen our friends came up from Virginia to make us visits, it was\r\ndelightful to take a carriage and give up days to sight-seeing; to visit\r\nthe White House and Capitol, the Patent Office with its miscellaneous\r\ntreasures; to point with pride to the rich gifts from crowned heads\r\nwhich our adored first President was too conscientious to accept; to\r\nwalk among the stones lying around the base of the unfinished monument\r\nand read the inscriptions from the states presenting them; to spend a\r\nday at the Smithsonian Institution, and to introduce our friends to its\r\npresident, Mr. Henry; and to Mr. Spencer Baird and Mr. Gerard, eminent\r\nnaturalists, who were giving their lives to the study of birds, beasts,\r\nand fishes,—finding them, Mr. Gerard said, \"so much more interesting\r\nthan men,\" adding hastily, \"we do not say ladies,\" and blushing after\r\nthe manner of cloistered scholars; to tell them interesting things\r\nabout Mr. Gerard who was a melancholy young man, and who had confided\r\nto me that he had sustained a great sorrow. Had he lost his fortune,\r\nor been crossed in love, was he homesick for his native Switzerland?\r\nWorse than any one or all of these! He had been sent once to Nantucket\r\nin the interests of his profession. There he had found a strange fish,\r\nhitherto unknown to science. He had classified its bones and laid them\r\nout on his table to count them. In a moment's absence the housemaid had\r\nentered and dusted his table.\r\n\r\nThen the visits to the galleries of the House and Senate Chamber,\r\nand the honor of pointing out the great men to our friends from rural\r\ndistricts; the long listening to interminable speeches, not clearly\r\nunderstood, but heard with a reverent conviction that all was coming out\r\nright in the end, that everybody was really working for the good of his\r\ncountry, and that we belonged to it all and were parts of it all.\r\n\r\nThis was the thought behind all other thoughts which glorified\r\neverything around us, enhanced every fortunate circumstance, and caused\r\nus to ignore the real discomforts of life in Washington: the cold,\r\nthe ice-laden streets in winter; the whirlwinds of dust and driving\r\nrains of spring; the swift-coming fierceness of summer heat; the rapid\r\natmospheric changes which would give us all these extremes in one week,\r\nor even one day, until it became the part of prudence never to sally\r\nforth on any expedition without \"a fan, an overcoat, and an umbrella.\"\r\n\r\nThe social life in Washington was almost as variable as the climate.\r\nAt the end of every four years the kaleidoscope turned, and lo!—a new\r\ncentral jewel and new colors and combinations in the setting.\r\n\r\nBut behind this \"floating population,\" as the political circles were\r\ntermed, there was a fine society in the fifties of \"old residents\" who\r\nnever bent the knee to Baal. This society was sufficient to itself,\r\nnever seeking the new, while accepting it occasionally with discretion,\r\nreservations, and much discriminating care. The sisters, Mrs. Gales and\r\nMrs. Seaton, wives of the editors of the _National Intelligencer_, led\r\nthis society. Mrs. Gales's home was outside the city, and thence every\r\nday Mr. Gales was driven in his barouche to his office. His paper was\r\nthe exponent of the Old-Line Whigs (the Republican party was formed\r\nlater) and in stern opposition to the Democrats. It was, therefore, a\r\nspecial and unexpected honor for a Democrat to be permitted to drive\r\nout to \"the cottage\" for a glass of wine and a bit of fruit-cake\r\nwith Mrs. Gales and Mrs. Seaton. Never have I seen these gentlewomen\r\nexcelled in genial hospitality. Mrs. Gales was a superb old lady and a\r\nfine conversationalist. She had the courteous repose born of dignity\r\nand intelligence. She was literally her husband's right hand,—he had\r\nlost his own,—and was the only person who could decipher his left-hand\r\nwriting. So that when anything appeared from his pen it had been copied\r\nby his wife before it reached the type-setter. A fine education this\r\nfor an intelligent woman; the very best schooling for a social life\r\nincluding diplomats from foreign countries, politicians of diverse\r\nopinions, artists, authors, musicians, women of fashion, to entertain\r\nwhom required infinite tact, cleverness, and an intimate acquaintance\r\nwith the absorbing questions of the day.\r\n\r\nOf course the levees and state receptions, which were accessible to all,\r\nrequired none of these things. The role of hostess on state occasions\r\ncould be filled creditably by any woman of ordinary physical strength,\r\npatience, and self-control, who knew when to be silent.\r\n\r\nWashington society, at the time of which I write, was comparatively\r\nfree from non-official men of wealth from other cities who, weary with\r\nthe monotonous round of travel,—to the Riviera, to Egypt, to Monte\r\nCarlo,—are attracted by the unique atmosphere of a city holding many\r\nforeigners, and devoted not to commercial but to social and political\r\ninterests. The doors of the White House and Cabinet offices being open\r\non occasions to all, they have opportunities denied them in their own\r\nhomes. Society in Washington in the fifties was peculiarly interesting\r\nin that it was composed exclusively of men whose presence argued them to\r\nhave been of importance at home. They had been elected by the people,\r\nor chosen by the President, or selected among the very best in foreign\r\ncountries; or they belonged to the United States Army or Navy service,\r\nor to the descendants of the select society which had gathered in the\r\ncity early in its history.\r\n\r\nDuring the Fillmore administration there were peculiar elements in\r\nWashington society. The President was born of poor English parents. At\r\nthe age of fifteen he was apprentice to a wool-carder in Livingston\r\nCounty, New York, representing in his father's mind no higher hope\r\nthan gradual advancement until he should attain the proud place of\r\nwoollen-draper. But at nineteen he had entered a lawyer's office,\r\nworking all day, teaching and studying at night. When he became\r\nPresident his tastes had been sufficiently ripened to enable him to\r\ngather around him men of literary taste and attainment. John P. Kennedy,\r\nan author and a man of elegant accomplishments, was Secretary of the\r\nNavy. Washington Irving was Kennedy's friend, and often his guest.\r\nLesser lights in the world of letters found Washington an agreeable\r\nresidence. We knew many of these men, and among them none was brighter,\r\nwittier, or more genial than G. P. R. James, the English novelist whose\r\nstar rose and set before 1860. He was the most prolific of writers,\r\n\"Like an endless chain of buckets in a well,\" said one; \"as fast as one\r\nis emptied up comes another.\"\r\n\r\nWe were very fond of Mr. James. One day he dashed in, much excited:—\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen the _Intelligencer_? By George, it's all true! Six times\r\nhas my hero, a 'solitary horseman,' emerged from a wood! My word! I was\r\ntotally unconscious of it! Fancy it! Six times! Well, it's all up with\r\nthat fellow. He has got to dismount and enter on foot: a beggar, or\r\nburglar, or pedler, or at best a mendicant friar.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" suggested one, \"he might drive, mightn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\" said Mr. James. \"Imagine a hero in a gig or a curricle!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said one, \"the word 'solitary' has given offence. Americans\r\ndislike exclusiveness. They are sensitive, you see, and look out for\r\nsnobs.\"\r\n\r\nHe made himself very merry over it; but the solitary horseman appeared\r\nno more in the few novels he was yet to write.\r\n\r\nOne day, after a pleasant visit from Mr. James and his wife, I\r\naccompanied them at parting to the front door, and found some difficulty\r\nin turning the bolt. He offered to assist, but I said no—he was not\r\nsupposed to understand the mystery of an American front door.\r\n\r\nHaving occasion a few minutes afterward to open the door for another\r\ndeparting guest, there on his knees outside was Mr. James, who\r\nlaughingly explained that he had left his wife at the corner, and had\r\ncome back to investigate that mystery. \"Perhaps you will tell me,\" he\r\nadded, and was much amused to learn that the American door opened of\r\nitself to an incoming guest, but positively refused without coaxing\r\nto let him out. \"By George, that's fine!\" he said, \"that'll please the\r\ncritics in my next.\" I never knew whether it was admitted, for I must\r\nconfess that, even with the stimulus of his presence, his books were\r\ndreary reading to my uninstructed taste.\r\n\r\nA very lovely and charming actress was prominent in Washington society\r\nat this time,—the daughter of an old New York family, Anna Cora (Ogden)\r\nMowatt. She was especially interesting to Virginians, for she had\r\ncaptivated Foushee Ritchie, soon afterward my husband's partner on the\r\neditorship of the _Richmond Enquirer_. Mr. Ritchie, a confirmed old\r\nbachelor, had been fascinated by Mrs. Mowatt's Parthenia (in \"Ingomar\")\r\nand was now engaged to her. He proudly brought to me a pair of velvet\r\nslippers she had embroidered for him, working around them as a border\r\na quotation from \"Ingomar\":—\r\n\r\n     \"Two souls with but a single thought,\r\n     Two hearts that beat as one.\"\r\n\r\nAnd oh, _how_ angry he was when an irreverent voice whispered one word,\r\n\"Soles!\"\r\n\r\n\"Cora must never hear of this,\" he declared indignantly; \"she is, beyond\r\nall women, incapable of _double entendre_, of coarse allusion.\"\r\n\r\nAlas! I cannot conclude my little story, \"And they were married and\r\nlived happily ever after.\" They were married—and lived miserably—and\r\nwere separated ever after. The single thought was how they could best\r\nescape each other—and the two hearts beat as one in the desire for\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\n\"The shadow of the coming war was even then beginning to darken the\r\nland and confuse legislation with bitter partisanship and continuous\r\nattempts at an impossible compromise,\" but, alas! our eyes were holden\r\nso we could not see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT PIERCE'S INAUGURATION\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of March, 1853, Franklin Pierce was inaugurated President\r\nof the United States. This was an exciting day for me. My husband had\r\nwritten articles for a Virginia paper which had won for him a place on\r\nthe editorial staff of the _Washington Union_, and was now in a position\r\nto break a lance with my friends, Messrs. Gales and Seaton. Mr. Pierce\r\nhad liked his articles in the _Union_, and sought his acquaintance. A\r\nfriendship rapidly followed which was a happiness to us both. So when\r\nsome member of the staff of the Democratic organ must be consulted about\r\nthe inaugural address, the President had sent for my young husband and\r\nhad taken counsel with him.\r\n\r\nI was delighted when I received an invitation from my good friends of\r\nthe Smithsonian Institution to join them in a pleasant room opening\r\non a balcony and overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue, where we were to\r\nhave a collation and witness the parade. My husband's sixteen-year-old\r\nsister, Fanny, was with me, and she was literally wild with delight.\r\nThe rest of the party were Mr. and Mrs. Spencer Baird, little Lucy\r\nBaird, Mr. Gerard, and Mr. Turner. Little eight-year-old Lucy was the\r\nbelle of the occasion; so wise in scientific matters, knowing so much\r\nabout \"specimens\" and \"extinct species\" that we felt ourselves heavy\r\nand ignorant beside her. \"Come now, Lucy,\" said Mr. Turner, \"I expect\r\nyou to take care of me on this occasion. These are painful scenes for\r\nan Englishman. When you see the Continental troops coming, give me the\r\nwink, and I'll slip away and stir the punch. Those are the fellows who\r\nwhipped the British!\"\r\n\r\nThe elements frowned upon the change of administration. The sun was\r\nblanketed with dark clouds, from which the snow fell thickly—not a\r\nsoft, enfolding snow, but snow driven by an angry wind. The crowd in\r\nthe avenue was immense; swelled by the presence of the largest number\r\nof strangers ever before gathered at an Inauguration, the majority of\r\nwhom were members of the mighty army of office-seekers from the party\r\nrecently come into power. From the White House to the Capitol, windows,\r\nbalconies, and roofs were thronged; and the sidewalks of the avenue\r\nwere filled with a motley crowd of men, women, and children, foreigners,\r\ngovernment clerks, and negroes.\r\n\r\nAbout twelve o'clock the boom of a great gun announced the moving of\r\nthe procession. The throng in the streets surged toward the gates of\r\nthe Capitol, and \"lined up\" on either side awaiting the arrival of the\r\ncortège. Carriages filled with women and children, some of them with\r\nthe emblazoned panels of foreign ministers, passed rapidly in advance\r\nof the cavalcade—the police actively engaged the while in keeping the\r\nwaiting crowd within bounds. Presently distant music was heard, and a\r\nmighty cheer announced the near approach of the escort. Six marshals in\r\ngay scarfs led the procession. Then came the \"flying artillery,\" drawn\r\nby fifty or more horses. An interval, and then platoons of soldiers of\r\ndiverse battalions filled square after square, and band after band of\r\nmartial music mingled with the cheers of the crowd.\r\n\r\nWe were all out now on the balcony, little Lucy keenly alert. Presently\r\nshe touched Mr. Turner on his arm and he fled! The Continentals were\r\npassing.\r\n\r\nFollowing these, in an open carriage drawn by four fine horses, came\r\nour President: the youngest, handsomest President we had ever elected.\r\nAs he neared our balcony we stood up, waved and cheered, and threw him\r\nflowers, and so winning in their enthusiasm were little Lucy (her mind\r\nbeing now quite at rest about Mr. Turner) and my own young sister, that\r\nthe President rose and bared his head to us.\r\n\r\nA platform had been erected over the steps of the east wing, and on it\r\nwas a table holding a Bible. The distinguished officials of the time\r\nwere seated around this table, and beneath it the crowd pushed and\r\nscrambled and struggled for place within hearing. Instantly there was\r\nsilence. The slender, almost boyish figure of our President approached\r\nthe table, and with bared head under the falling snow stood for a moment\r\nsurveying the crowd.\r\n\r\nHis face was pale, and his countenance wore an expression of weary\r\nsadness. When he took the oath he did not, as is the custom, use the\r\nword \"swear.\" Placing his left hand on the Bible without raising the\r\nbook, he raised his right and, looking upward, \"affirmed\" that, God\r\nhelping him, he would be faithful to his trust.\r\n\r\nThere were tears in his voice, but it was musical, and his enunciation\r\nwas clear and distinct.\r\n\r\nOnly two months before, his only child, a beautiful boy of thirteen, had\r\nbeen killed in a railroad collision—killed before his parents' eyes! His\r\naddress began, \"My countrymen! It is a relief to feel that no heart but\r\nmy own can know the personal regret and bitter sorrow over which I have\r\nbeen borne to a position so suitable for others rather than desirable\r\nfor myself.\"\r\n\r\nThe public does not tolerate the intrusion of a man's personal joys\r\nand griefs into his official life. However willing the world may be\r\nto sympathize, it considers this indicative of a mind lacking fineness\r\nand delicacy. To keep one's inner self in the background should be the\r\ninstinct, and is surely the policy, of every man and woman who aspires\r\nto popularity.\r\n\r\nThere were many who quickly criticised this unfortunate sentence of the\r\nPresident. The Whig journals sneered at it as \"a trick of the orator to\r\nawaken personal interest before proceeding to unfold his public policy.\"\r\nBut he had the sympathetic tears of many of his audience.\r\n\r\nHis address went on to discuss the annexation of Cuba—a dream which\r\nlasted through many subsequent years. The Pearl of the Antilles was\r\nardently coveted as a pendant to our chain of states, but she will\r\nnever belong to us, unless as the result of more misfortune. The\r\nPresident then pledged himself to the never dying Monroe Doctrine,\r\nprayed appealingly for the preservation of our Union, and touched upon\r\nthe troubled questions which, despite all our wars and sufferings, are\r\nnot yet fully settled. And then, amid cheers and shouts and salvos of\r\nartillery, he was driven to his new home, and it was all over.\r\n\r\nThree days after the inauguration the Cabinet nominations were sent\r\nto the Senate. Mr. Marcy was to be Secretary of State; Mr. Guthrie,\r\nSecretary of the Treasury; Jefferson Davis, of War; James Dobbin,\r\nof the Navy; Robert McClelland, of the Interior; James Campbell,\r\nPostmaster-General; Caleb Cushing, Attorney-General—four men from the\r\nNorth, three from the South. These, then, with their families, were\r\nto lead the social life of Washington for four years. The Executive\r\nMansion, shrouded in gloom, could never become a social centre.\r\n\r\nWe had the honor of knowing well the three most distinguished of these\r\nmen, Mr. Marcy, Mr. Davis, and Mr. Cushing.\r\n\r\nMr. Marcy, the best-known member of the Cabinet, strong, honest, and an\r\nadroit politician, was a man of rugged and abrupt manners, yet a great\r\nfavorite with the ladies. We at once became keenly interested in his\r\ninitial proceedings. He was sternly democratic in his ideas. Absorbing\r\nas were the cares of his department, exciting and menacing as were the\r\nquestions of the hour, he inaugurated his official life by settling\r\nmatters of dress and etiquette—so far as they related to the presence of\r\nAmerican envoys at foreign courts. President Jackson had been supposed\r\nto be democratic, but he was a bloated aristocrat beside Mr. Marcy.\r\nJackson had rejected the prescribed court dress,—embroidered cuffs and\r\ncape, white breeches, gold knee-buckles, white silk stockings, gold\r\nshoe-buckles, chapeau-bras, cockade, eagle, white feather, and sword.\r\nAlackaday, that we should have lost all this bravery! Jackson decreed no\r\ncape at all (such a friendly fashion to laden shoulders), no embroidery\r\nexcept a gold star on the coat-collar,—but breeches and modest buckles,\r\na sword, a chapeau-bras with eagle and cockade.\r\n\r\nNow why should Mr. Marcy make trouble by meddling with the cut of\r\nthe garments of our representatives abroad—at a time, too, when such\r\na number of serious questions were about to come before him; when\r\nfilibusters were at work, a war with Spain imminent, treaties to be made\r\nwith Mexico, and fishery questions to be settled with England? Simply,\r\nI suppose, because great men all over the world have condescended\r\nto prescribe in trifling matters—matters belonging to the chef, the\r\nmilliner, the arbiter of fleeting fashions. It would seem that the\r\ngreater the man the greater his appreciation of trifles. Everything\r\nto him is important—from the signing of a treaty to the tying of a\r\nshoestring.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of Mr. Marcy's meddling were far-reaching. On June 1,\r\n1853, he issued a circular recommending that our representatives abroad\r\nshould, in order to show their devotion to republican institutions,\r\nappear whenever practicable in the simple dress of an American citizen.\r\n\r\nOur Minister at Berne found the court of Switzerland quite willing\r\nto receive him in his citizen's dress. The Ministers at Turin and\r\nBrussels reported they would have no difficulty in carrying out the\r\ninstructions of the State Department. The representative at Berlin was\r\nat once informed that such action would be considered disrespectful.\r\nThe king of Sweden insisted on court dress at social functions. Mr.\r\nAugust Belmont, at The Hague, received a cold permission from the king\r\nto dress as he pleased—and it is recorded (as matter for gratitude on\r\nthe part of the American Minister) that after all, and notwithstanding,\r\nthe queen actually danced with him in his citizen's dress, and the king\r\ncondescended to shake him by the hand and to talk with him!\r\n\r\nMr. Mason, at the French court, could not face the music! He consulted\r\nhis wife, and together they agreed upon a compromise. He appeared in\r\nan embroidered coat, sword, and cocked hat, and had the misfortune to\r\nreceive from Mr. Marcy a severe rebuke.\r\n\r\nMr. Buchanan, at the court of St. James, having no wife to consult,\r\nthought long and anxiously on the subject. The question was still\r\nunsettled at the opening of Parliament in February, 1854. Our Minister\r\ndid not attend,—he had \"nothing to wear,\"—whereupon \"there was quite\r\na sensation in the House of Lords.\" \"Indeed,\" he wrote to Mr. Marcy,\r\n\"I have found difficulty in preventing this incident from becoming a\r\nsubject of inquiry and remark in the House of Commons.\" Think of that!\r\nAt a time when England was on the eve of a war with Russia, all the\r\nnewspapers, court officials, House of Commons, exercised about the dress\r\nof the American Minister! The _London Times_ stated that on a diplomatic\r\noccasion \"the American Minister sate unpleasantly conscious of his\r\nsingularity.\" The _London Chronicle_ blamed General Pierce's republican\r\nill manners, and the \"American puppyism,\" and continued: \"There is\r\nnot the least reason why her Majesty should be troubled to receive the\r\n'gentleman in the black coat' from Yankee-land! He can say his say at\r\nthe Foreign Office, dine at a chop-house in King Street, sleep at the\r\nold Hummums, and be off as he came, per liner, when his business is\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Buchanan, sorely pressed, conceived the idea of costuming\r\nhimself like General Washington, and to that end examined Stuart's\r\nportrait. He may even have gone so far as to indulge in a private\r\nrehearsal—_queue_, powdered wig, and all; but he seems to have perceived\r\nhe would only make himself ridiculous; so he took his life in his hands\r\nand—brave gentleman as he was—appeared at the queen's levee in the\r\ndress of an American citizen; and she, true lady as she was, settled the\r\nmatter, for her court at least, by receiving him as she did all others.\r\nMr. Buchanan wrote to his niece, Miss Harriet Lane, \"I wore a sword to\r\ngratify those who yielded so much, and to distinguish me from the upper\r\ncourt servants.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Soulé, at the court of Madrid, adopted the costume of Benjamin\r\nFranklin at the court of Louis XVI—sword, chapeau, black velvet, and\r\nmuch embroidery, looking, \"with his black eyes, black looks, and pale\r\ncomplexion, less like the philosopher whose costume he imitated than\r\nthe master of Ravenswood.\" There had been a lively discussion among the\r\nAustrian and Mexican Ministers and the Countess of Montijo, the mother\r\nof the Empress Eugénie and of the Duchess of Alba, whether or no he\r\nshould be rejected; but Mr. Soulé did not know this. The queen received\r\nhim, he wrote to Mr. Marcy, \"with marked attention and courtesy.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no telling whether this simple deviation from the prescribed\r\ncourt dress was not the real cause of Mr. Soulé's serious troubles\r\nat court. It was the Duke of Alba who provided the spark which fired\r\nthe train of Spanish indignation against him and occasioned a quarrel\r\nwhich resulted in two duels and strained relations which were never\r\nreconciled.\r\n\r\nIt is always dangerous to infringe upon accepted rules of etiquette,\r\neven in association with those who are themselves defiant of these\r\nrules. I discovered that Mr. Marcy was very jealous of respect due to\r\nhimself, as well as to his government.\r\n\r\nHe was a prime favorite, as I have said, with the ladies—and with none\r\nmore than the charming family of \"Father Ritchie,\" as we called one\r\nof Washington's most esteemed citizens. Mr. Ritchie had been editor\r\nfor forty years of the _Richmond Enquirer_, which he had founded under\r\nthe auspices of Thomas Jefferson, and made one of the most influential\r\nDemocratic papers of the country. His home in Washington was noted for\r\nelegant hospitality. He lived next door to Mr. Corcoran on Lafayette\r\nSquare, near St. John's Church. He had lovely daughters, and whenever\r\nMr. Marcy appeared in the salons of the town, one or more of these\r\nladies was sure to be with him.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that some of us were much interested in a poor,\r\nworthy young man, who desired a position in the State Department. His\r\napplication had long ago been filed in the office and we were afraid\r\nhe had been forgotten. We longed to ask Mr. Marcy about it, but did not\r\nknow how we could manage to bring the subject to his notice.\r\n\r\n\"Let's make Ann Eliza ask him,\" suggested one. Now, Ann Eliza Ritchie\r\nwas a beauty, as fascinating a young creature as the Lord ever made,\r\nirresistible alike to man and woman. She hesitated,—everybody was afraid\r\nof Mr. Marcy—but goaded on by us, she ventured:—\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mr. Marcy\" (Virginia girls always begin with \"Oh\"), \"Oh, Mr. Marcy!\r\nThey all want to know if you are going to appoint Mr. Randolph in your\r\ndepartment.\"\r\n\r\nThe lion turned. He did not growl, he simply roared: \"_What_ do you\r\nmean, madame? How _dare_ you take the bull by the horns in this unseemly\r\nmanner?\"\r\n\r\nAnd so no more of Ann Eliza Ritchie. And so no more of the rest of us.\r\nWe learned a lesson we never forgot; namely, not to meddle in Cabinet\r\naffairs, but to content ourselves with the honor of amusing great\r\nmen,—in short, to know our place and keep it.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson Davis had been an eminent public man long before the\r\npresidency of Mr. Pierce. He was a graduate of West Point. He had been\r\nan officer in the Indian wars. He was in the House of Representatives\r\nat the age of thirty-seven. John Quincy Adams heard his maiden speech\r\nand said: \"That young man is no ordinary man. He will make his mark yet,\r\nmind me.\" His devotion to reading and study amounted to a passion. He\r\nhad served as a colonel in the Mexican War. It was said of him that \"his\r\nbrilliant movement at Buena Vista carried the day, and that his tactical\r\nconception was worthy of a Cæsar or a Napoleon.\"[2]\r\n\r\nHe was afterward a member for four years of the United States Senate,\r\nand although defeated in a gubernatorial contest in Mississippi, he\r\nrose rapidly in the esteem of the people of his own section; and now,\r\nat the age of forty-five, he was the \"leader of the Southern people,\r\nand successor of John C. Calhoun.\" He was leader a few years later in\r\nthe Battle of the Giants, fought so bitterly in Mr. Buchanan's time.\r\n\r\nOf Mr. Caleb Cushing I knew less than I did of Mr. Davis and Mr.\r\nMarcy. He had great learning, great ability, wide experience in public\r\nlife. He has been described as a \"scholar, author, lawyer, statesman,\r\ndiplomatist, general, and judge.\" He was one of the rare class of men\r\nwho are precocious in childhood and youth, and who go intellectually\r\nfrom strength to strength as long as they live. He was graduated from\r\nHarvard when only seventeen years of age. He was a most attractive man\r\nin manner and address, and a fascinating public speaker. He could quote\r\nthe \"Iliad\" from beginning to end, and could speak to each one of the\r\nforeign ambassadors in his own tongue.\r\n\r\nMr. Cushing sent an editorial nearly every day to the _Washington\r\nUnion_, of which my husband was associate editor. No compliment upon\r\nhis own articles which my husband ever received was more gratefully\r\nappreciated than one from Mr. Cushing. A serious difference of\r\nopinion had arisen with the senior editor, because of a paper upon\r\nthe Anglo-Russian war, in which my husband warmly advocated the side\r\nof Russia. He declined retracting his words (which were copied and\r\ntranslated abroad), and finally gave up his position on the paper rather\r\nthan express sentiments other than his own. Mr. Cushing applauded\r\nhim, and bade him stand fearlessly by an argument, \"unanswered and\r\nunanswerable.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after this Mr. Pierce appointed my husband special Minister to\r\nGreece. I longed to go with him to Athens, but my mother's health was\r\nfrail, and I felt I could not leave her. So I returned to my home in\r\nVirginia with my children, and their father went on his mission alone.\r\nWhen it was accomplished, the Pierce administration was drawing to a\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nMy temporary home was near Charlottesville, and thither, on his way\r\nSouth, came the President to spend a day and to visit Monticello, the\r\nhome of the Father of Democracy. He wrote to me, inviting me to spend\r\nthe evening with him and a few friends at his hotel. We had a delightful\r\nevening. He told me all I wished to know of the exile far away in\r\nGreece, expressed warm friendship for him and his, and presented me with\r\ntwo gorgeous volumes, bound sumptuously in green morocco, and inscribed,\r\nfrom my \"friend Franklin Pierce,\" in his own fine handwriting. I played\r\nat his request, he sitting the while beside the piano. I selected\r\nHenselt's \"L'Elisire d'Amour\" and \"La Gondola,\" to the great delight\r\nof the President. The other day I read, from the pen of some irreverent\r\ncritic, of the \"lilting puerilities of the innocuous Henselt.\" All the\r\nsame, these puerilities pleased the President, and will charm the world\r\nuntil the end of time.\r\n\r\nI feel that I have said too little of Mr. Pierce in this sketch of\r\nthe men we knew. I cannot hope to convey an adequate conception of\r\nhis captivating voice and manner. Surely its source was in genuine\r\nkindness of heart. I knew nothing of him as a politician. It was urged\r\nagainst him that he was extremely partial to the South. I know the\r\nSouth honored and loved him always. It was said that \"Franklin Pierce\r\ncould not say 'No'\"—a weakness which doubtless caused him a world of\r\ntrouble in his political relations, but to which he may have owed\r\nsomething of the indescribable charm for which he was conspicuous.\r\nMr. Seward, his political opponent, wrote to his wife: \"The President\r\nhas a _very_ winning way in his manners.\" I can fully understand the\r\nbeautiful friendship between him and Nathaniel Hawthorne. How exquisite\r\nthe answer of the author when chidden because he had dedicated a book\r\nto the President, after the latter had become unpopular: \"Unpopular, is\r\nhe? If he is so exceedingly unpopular that his name is enough to sink\r\nthe volume, there is so much the more need that an old friend should\r\nstand by him.\"\r\n\r\nHawthorne had then arrived at the height of his own popularity, while\r\nhis friend, on account of his fancied Southern sympathies, had lost the\r\nfriendship of his own people. A bitter lot for a sensitive patriot, who\r\nhad done his best! \"An angel can no more!\"\r\n\r\nMy residence in Washington during the Pierce administration was too\r\nshort to afford me more than a brief glimpse of the social life of the\r\ncity, but I keenly enjoyed that glimpse. I had the good fortune to find\r\nfavor, as I have said, with the old residents, and also with the Hon.\r\nW. W. Corcoran, at whose house the best of the old and new could always\r\nbe found.\r\n\r\nThere I met many distinguished people. I remember especially General\r\nWinfield Scott, Sam Houston, and Washington Irving. General Scott,\r\ngrand, imposing, and ceremonious, never failed to tell everybody that\r\nhe had been groomsman for my husband's father—he had been born in\r\nPetersburg, Virginia. He addressed all young women as \"fair lady.\" He\r\nwas a great hero and a splendid old fellow in every particular, and he\r\nnever for a moment forgot his heroism and his splendor. People called\r\nhim \"vain.\" So great a man could not be accused of vanity—\"the food of\r\nfools.\" He had a reasonable pride in what he had achieved, but his was\r\ncertainly not the kind of pride that apes humility.\r\n\r\nAs for old Sam Houston, he had had romance enough in his past life for\r\na dozen heroes. He had lived many years among the Indians, had fought\r\nin many wars, had achieved the independence of Texas—what had he not\r\ndone? Now he was Senator from Texas, very popular, and rather impatient,\r\none might judge, of the confinement and restraints of his position. It\r\nwas amusing to see the little pages of the Senate Chamber providing him\r\nwith small bundles of soft pine sticks, which he would smuggle into his\r\ndesk with a rather shamefaced expression. Doubled up over this desk, his\r\nface almost covered with his hanging eyebrows and iron-gray whiskers, he\r\noccupied himself in whittling sticks as a safety-valve for unrest while\r\nlistening to the long speeches, lasting sometimes until midnight. He\r\nwould prove afterward in his brilliant conversation that he had not lost\r\na word. Sometimes the pine under his knife would take shape in little\r\ncrosses, amulets, etc. He was known, now and then, to draw from the\r\npocket of his tiger-skin vest an exquisitely carved heart and present\r\nit to some young lady whose beauty attracted him.\r\n\r\nThen there was Washington Irving,—an old man with but a few years to\r\nlive. He died before the end of the next administration. One would never\r\nthink him old,—so keen and alert was he,—but for his trick of suddenly\r\nfalling asleep for a minute or two in the middle of a conversation.\r\nA whisper, \"Sh-h-h,\" would pass from one to another, \"Mr. Irving is\r\nasleep;\" and in a moment he would wake up, rub his hands, and exclaim,\r\n\"Well, as we were saying,\" taking up the conversation just where he had\r\nleft it.\r\n\r\nMy little sister worshipped Mr. Irving. \"Only let me see him,\" she\r\npleaded; \"only let me touch the hand that wrote the 'Sketch Book.'\"\r\n\r\nI repeated this when I introduced her, and he said: \"Ah, yes, yes! I\r\nknow! I have heard all that before—many times before. And just as I am\r\ngetting happy over it, here comes a young fellow, some whipper-snapper\r\nwho never wrote a line, and [mimicking] it's 'Good evening, Mr. Irving,\r\nI am glad to have met you.'\"\r\n\r\nIt happened that my sister had not heard. She was already distraite.\r\nHer favorite friend had appeared, and she at once echoed, \"Good\r\nevening, Mr. Irving, I am glad to have met you,\" to the old gentleman's\r\ninfinite delight and amusement. I was proud to have had even a word with\r\n\"America's most celebrated writer: exquisite in courtesy and fidelity\r\nand of lofty purity of character.\" He died in 1859—the heart which had\r\nached so long for the death of an early love failing him suddenly at\r\n\"Sleepy Hollow,\" his home on the Hudson. His country scarcely noticed\r\nhis death! That country, crazed on the subject of slavery, was writing\r\ncolumns on columns about John Brown.\r\n\r\nOne morning, when I was passing the corner of Fifteenth Street, below\r\nPresident Square, my steps were arrested by a large crowd which had\r\nassembled in front of the bank of Corcoran & Riggs. \"Dear me,\" I\r\nthought, \"has the bank failed?\" But the green blinds of the plain\r\ntwo-storied building were all open, and presently through the opening\r\ndoor, escorted by Mr. Riggs himself, came a slight little maid in a\r\nConnemara cloak and hood. Mr. Riggs put her in a waiting carriage,\r\nslammed the door, and, with a look which said plainly to the waiting\r\ncrowd, \"No more this time,\" reëntered the house.\r\n\r\nThe little lady was Adelina Patti—just sixteen—and Mr. Riggs's guest\r\nduring the few days she spent in Washington on her way to meet Southern\r\nengagements. Congressmen tendered her a complimentary benefit, and she\r\nsang in a small hall, supported by a few local musicians. She stood\r\nbefore us in a simple muslin slip, her dark hair bound with a narrow\r\nblue velvet ribbon,—a Scottish \"snood,\"—and never, in all her brilliant\r\nlife, was she more appreciated, more admired.\r\n\r\nI could remember a time of musical dearth in Virginia, relieved only\r\nby rare occasions when the dimly lighted concert rooms would be filled\r\nby eager listeners to wandering minstrels: the Hutchinson family, Anna\r\nBishop, the Orpheans, Parodi, and Amalia Patti. After a while Strakosch\r\nappeared with an infant phenomenon. She looked precisely like a French\r\ndoll, with her little round face, pink cheeks, and big black eyes,\r\ndressed in short frocks of rose-color or blue silk. But she sang like a\r\nlinnet on a bough; and it was comical to see her in her duets inclining\r\nher small head toward her contralto, after the manner of other divas.\r\nThis was the ten-year-old Adelina Patti!\r\n\r\n\"What does she keep in her throat?\" asked a little girl near her own\r\nage—adding comfortably, \"Never mind, we will find out when she dies!\"\r\n\r\nMaurice Strakosch accompanied her on a square piano placed upon the\r\nfloor, the platform being often too narrow to admit it. He played,\r\nfrequently turning his face to the audience, nodding and smiling, as if\r\nto say:—\r\n\r\n\"See this little marvel I have discovered! Is she not a darling?\"\r\n\r\nThe midget had an uncertain temper in those days. Travelling once in\r\nthe same car with a lady who took her fancy, she found an opportunity\r\nto free her mind of her opinion of her troupe: Amalia was jealous\r\nof her; Amalia would shake and pinch her behind the scenes if the\r\naudience applauded her; Strakosch was utterly horrid—just observe his\r\ngreat hands! Not for worlds would she sing for him were it not for the\r\nsugar-plums!\r\n\r\nAt the end of the journey Strakosch approached the little girl and held\r\nout his hand to take her to her sister.\r\n\r\n\"I am not going with you,\" said Adelina, \"I am going home with this\r\nlady.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but impossible!\" said Strakosch.\r\n\r\n\"I will!\" said the small rebel. \"You know I always do things when I say\r\n'I will.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" said the lady (she was Mrs. Glasgow, the lovely mother of\r\nEllen Glasgow, the authoress). \"Why not? Let her come with me! I will\r\ntake good care of her.\"\r\n\r\nStrakosch shrugged his shoulders. A scene was imminent. \"If I consent,\r\nAdelina,\" he said at last, \"will you be sure to be ready when I come\r\nfor you for rehearsal? Will you be sure to sing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will _you_ be sure to bring me back?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure—I promise.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much candy?\" was the next excited question.\r\n\r\n\"A whole pound.\"\r\n\r\n\"No—not enough!\"\r\n\r\n\"Two pounds,\" said Strakosch, glancing around to satisfy himself that\r\nthe scene attracted admirers and possible concert goers.\r\n\r\n\"Not enough,\" persisted Adelina, shaking her head.\r\n\r\n\"A hatful!\" cried Strakosch, and won the day.\r\n\r\nMrs. Glasgow devoted herself to the little girl for the four days of her\r\nstay. On the last evening she invited ten or fifteen child neighbors to\r\na dolls' party with Adelina Patti. At the end of the evening she said:\r\n\"Now, Adelina, these little girls have been very kind to you. They have\r\nbrought you lovely flowers—I wish you to sing one little song for them.\"\r\n\r\nA shrewd look possessed the tiny face. \"_Sing—for—them!_ Sing without\r\nmoney! Mais non! J'ai toujours beaucoup des fleurs.\"\r\n\r\nShe disappeared for a while from public view. I saw her no more\r\nuntil her visit to Washington. Later, if I may anticipate, during Mr.\r\nBuchanan's administration, she made her début in \"Lucia di Lammermoor.\"\r\nPeople fought for seats and boxes. Three rival beauties secured the\r\nthree best—tiny, comfortless stalls—at ninety dollars each. It was\r\nsomething to see Miss Harriet Lane, Mrs. John R. Thompson, and Mrs.\r\nStephen A. Douglas in those three boxes! Each was filled with beautiful\r\nwomen, and the Cabinet officers and Senators stood behind.\r\n\r\n\"What is all this about?\" asked Judge Douglas, the \"Little Giant.\"\r\n\r\n\"The opera follows Scott's 'Bride of Lammermoor,'\" I gently suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Whose bride was she? Where did she live?\" asked the mighty man, the\r\nfamous Senator who came so near being President.\r\n\r\n\"I doubt whether she lived at all,\" I told him. \"She is a creature of\r\npure imagination, I'm afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said the Senator, contemptuously, and gave no more attention to\r\nthe stage nor to the divine artist upon it.\r\n\r\nAs I had come to Washington from Virginia, where everybody's\r\ngreat-grandfather knew my great-grandfather, where the rules of\r\netiquette were only those of courtesy and good breeding, I had many a\r\ntroubled moment in my early Washington life, lest I should transgress\r\nsome law of precedence, etc. I wisely took counsel with one of my\r\n\"old residents,\" and she gave me a few simple rules whereby the young\r\nchaperon of a very young girl might be guided: \"My dear,\" said this\r\nlady, \"My dear, you know you cannot always have your husband to attend\r\nyou. It will be altogether proper for you to go with your sister to\r\nmorning and afternoon receptions. When you arrive, send for the host or\r\nthe master of ceremonies, and he will take you in and present you. Of\r\ncourse, your husband will take you to balls; if he is busy, you simply\r\ncannot go! I think you would do well to make a rule _never_, under any\r\ncircumstances, to drive in men's carriages. There are so many foreigners\r\nhere, you must be careful. They never bring their own court manners to\r\nWashington. They take their cue from the people they meet. If you are\r\nhigh and haughty, they will be high and haughty. If you are genially\r\ncivil but reserved, they will be so. If you talk personalities in a free\r\nand easy way, they will spring some audacious piece of scandal on you,\r\nand the Lord only knows where they'll end.\"\r\n\r\nNow, it so happened that I had just received a request from a Frenchman\r\nwho had brought letters, to be allowed to escort Madame and Mademoiselle\r\nto a fête in Georgetown. We were to drive through the avenue of\r\nblossoming crab-apples, and rendezvous at a spring for a picnic. I\r\nforget the name of our hostess, but she had arranged a gay festival,\r\nincluding music and dancing on the green. I had accepted this invitation\r\nand the escort of M. Raoul, and received a note from him asking at what\r\nhour he should have the honor, etc., and I immediately ran home and\r\nwrote that \"Madame would be happy to see M. Raoul _à trois heures_\"—and\r\nthat Madame asked the privilege of using her own horses, etc. I made\r\nhaste to engage an open carriage and congratulated myself on my clever\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was delicious. Monsieur appeared on the moment, and\r\nwe waited for my carriage. The gay equipages of other members of the\r\nparty drove up and waited for us. Presently, rattling down the street,\r\ncame an old ramshackle \"night-hawk,\" bearing the mud-and-dust scars\r\nof many journeys, the seats ragged and tarnished, raw-boned horses,\r\nwith rat-eaten manes and tails, harness tied with rope,—the only\r\nredeeming feature the old negro on the box, who, despite his humiliating\r\n_entourage_, had the air of a gentleman.\r\n\r\nWhat could I do? There was nothing to be done!\r\n\r\nMonsieur handed me in without moving a muscle of his face, handed in\r\nmy sister, entered himself, and spoke no word during the drive. He\r\nconducted us gravely to the place of rendezvous, silently and gravely\r\nwalked around the grounds with us, silently and gravely brought us home\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nI grew hot and cold by turns, and almost shed tears of mortification. I\r\nmade no apology—what could I say? Arriving at my own door, I turned and\r\ninvited my escort to enter. He raised his hat and, with an air of the\r\ndeepest dejection, dashed with something very like sarcastic humility,\r\nsaid he trusted Madame had enjoyed the afternoon—thanked her for the\r\nhonor done himself—and only regretted the disappointment of the French\r\nMinister, the Count de Sartiges, at not having been allowed to serve\r\nMadame with his own state coach, which had been placed at his disposal\r\nfor Madame's pleasure!\r\n\r\nAs he turned away my chagrin was such I came near forgetting to give my\r\ncoachman his little \"tip.\"\r\n\r\nI began, \"Oh, Uncle, how _could_ you?\" when he interrupted: \"Now,\r\nMistis, don't you say nothin'. I knowed dis ole fune'al hack warn't\r\nfittin' for you, but der warn't nar another kerridge in de stable. De\r\nboss say, 'Go 'long, Jerry, an' git 'er dar!'—an' I done done it! An'\r\nI done fotch 'er back, too!\"\r\n\r\nI never saw M. Raoul afterward. There's no use crying over spilt\r\nmilk, or broken eggs, or French monsieurs, or even French counts and\r\nMinisters. I soon left for Virginia, and to be relieved of the dread of\r\nmeeting M. Raoul softened my regret at leaving Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT BUCHANAN\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days after Mr. Buchanan's inauguration, the nominations for the\r\nCabinet were sent to the Senate. The venerable Lewis Cass, with many\r\nyears of honorable service behind him, was Secretary of State,—selected,\r\nthe \"Old-Line Whigs\" said, because the President meant really to be\r\nSecretary of State himself, and he wished an amiable first assistant.\r\nMoreover, he liked to say \"old Lewis Cass,\" as though he were himself so\r\nmuch younger. Hon. Howell Cobb of Georgia had the Treasury Department.\r\nHe was a man of political ability, \"frank and genial,\" sagacious and\r\nconservative, \"qualities fitting him well to dominate his associates.\"\r\nMr. Floyd, who \"belonged to the first families of Virginia,\" was\r\nthe Secretary of War. Mr. Toucey of Connecticut was Secretary of the\r\nNavy, Mr. Jacob Thompson of Mississippi, Secretary of the Interior,\r\nMr. Brown of Tennessee, Postmaster-General, and Judge Jeremiah Black,\r\nAttorney-General,—three from the North, four from the South. The new\r\nCabinet, people said, was far inferior in capacity to the retiring one.\r\n\r\nThe new President was a bachelor. Despite his years and his cold,\r\nreserved manner, his fidelity to the memory of beautiful Miss Coleman,\r\nto whom he had been affianced in his youth, invested him with the\r\ninterest which attaches to romance. This was enhanced by his devotion to\r\nhis niece, Miss Harriet Lane. In her affection he found the only solace\r\nof his lonely life. For her sake he condescended to unbend in public;\r\nand to brighten the atmosphere around her, he sometimes became quite\r\na jaunty old bachelor. She was his confidante in all matters political\r\nand personal. A stately etiquette ruled between the two. She was always\r\naddressed as \"Miss Harriet,\" and to her he was \"The President\"—never\r\n\"Uncle Buchanan,\" except on the rare occasions when she considered it\r\nworth her while to coax him in order to carry a point.\r\n\r\nWashington was never gayer than during this administration, more\r\nmemorable than any other except Washington's and Lincoln's. The mighty\r\ngiants of the House and Senate were there, the men who must be held\r\nlargely responsible for that most unnecessary, cruel, and wicked war—the\r\nwar between the Northern and Southern states of America. Washington was\r\nthe storm centre, charged with the electric forces so soon to burst in\r\nfury upon the country.\r\n\r\nBut before we enter upon these troubled times, we will live over again\r\nsome of the happy, care-forgetting months of our life in Washington.\r\n\r\nMy husband who had succeeded Mr. Ritchie as one of the editors of the\r\n_Richmond Enquirer_ was now a member of Congress. He had accomplished\r\nhis mission to Greece to the satisfaction of his government and to his\r\nown pleasure and profit. With a good courier and a generous country\r\nat his back, he had traversed Europe, had seen Venice rise from the\r\nsea, had revelled in the grandeur that was—and is—Rome, had beheld\r\nthe mosques and minarets of the Byzantine city from the waters of the\r\nGolden Horn, had looked into the inscrutable eyes of the Sphinx, and\r\nhad finally taken up his abode under the shadow of the Acropolis. There\r\nhe had met the \"Maid of Athens,\" now stout, middle-aged Mrs. Black, so\r\nthe poor American Minister, who was young and romantic,—in order to\r\nunderstand the passionate entreaty of Byron to return the wandering\r\nheart of him or else take the rest of him,—was constrained to think\r\nof the poem, and look the while at a dark-eyed Greek beauty named\r\n\"Elpis\"—at least this was the explanation made to me of his frequent\r\nallusions in his letters to the latter. There, too, he had charmed\r\nQueen Mathilde with a description of the night-blooming cereus of this\r\ncountry and had stricken the court of King Otho dumb with amazement by\r\noutrageous American boasting.\r\n\r\n\"Kindly tell us, your Excellency,\" inquired the king at a state banquet,\r\n\"what subject most interests your country at the present moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"The problem, may it please your Majesty, of how we shall govern our\r\nsuperfluous territory and invest our superfluous treasure.\"\r\n\r\nThis may not have pleased his Majesty, but it certainly astounded\r\nhim. Little Greece was, at the moment, hemmed in by organized bands of\r\nbrigands and sorely pressed for the means of existence.\r\n\r\nOur envoy had the honor, too, of attending, with Madame le Vert, the\r\nball at the Hôtel de Ville, and of witnessing the opening quadrille,\r\ndanced by Victoria and Albert, Louis Napoleon and his sister Mathilde,\r\nthe empress being ill. Both queen and princess seemed young and happy,\r\nboth attired in white satin flounced with point lace, and wearing a\r\nprince's ransom in jewels.\r\n\r\nThe weather was fearfully hot, and the royal party danced but once. The\r\nqueen did not step a stately measure, dancing \"high and disposedly\";—but\r\nshe entered into the spirit of the hour heartily, and, although the\r\nmother of eight children, danced with the glee of a young girl, growing\r\nwithal very red in the face like any ordinary mortal.\r\n\r\nAt one of the gala days of the Exposition in Paris, a very large woman\r\nattracted much attention. She was neither young nor handsome, but had\r\na comfortable, well-to-do air of content. A profusion of light curls\r\nclustered around her rotund face. These ringlets were all that was left\r\nof the beauty of the Countess Guiccioli! Alas, there was no \"Elpis\" at\r\nhand for consolation. All these things and more would have appeared in\r\na charming volume but for the secession of South Carolina, as will be\r\nseen later on in my story.\r\n\r\nI never regretted the loss of this beautiful opportunity in my life.\r\nMy mother had been nursed back to bless me and mine a few years\r\nlonger. Moreover, I found myself enriched. I had pictures, ravishing\r\npictures, Raphael's \"Belle Jardiniere,\" a priceless Raffaello Morghen's\r\nproof impression of the \"Madonna della Seggiola,\" Guido's \"Aurora\"\r\nwith its glorious women—the most glorious being (if she would only\r\nturn around) the one with her back to the world. I had many others,\r\nTitian, Domenichino, Murillo, Leonardo da Vinci. I had amber from\r\nConstantinople, curios and antiques from Egypt, corals and cameos from\r\nNaples and Florence, silks from Broussa (afterward swallowed up by an\r\nearthquake), silks and velvets from Lyons, laces from Brussels, perfumes\r\nfrom the land of Araby the blest,—things mightily consoling to a woman\r\nin her early twenties.\r\n\r\nWe found a large house on New York Avenue and filled it with good\r\nVirginia servants. Admonished by experience, we secured horses and a\r\ncareful coachman.\r\n\r\nWe had come to stay! My husband represented the old district of his\r\nkinsman, John Randolph of Roanoke, and his constituents were devoted\r\nto him. They would never supplant him with another. Of that we might\r\nbe sure. God granting life and health, we were going to be happy young\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe market in Washington was abundantly supplied with the finest game\r\nand fish from the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Virginia, and the waters\r\nof the Potomac. Brant, ruddy duck, canvasback duck, sora, oysters,\r\nand terrapin were within the reach of any housekeeper. Oysters, to be\r\nopened at a moment's notice, were planted on the cellar floors, and fed\r\nwith salt water, and the cellars, as far as the mistress was concerned,\r\nwere protected from invasion by the large terrapins kept there—a most\r\nefficient police force, crawling about with their outstretched necks\r\nand wicked eyes.\r\n\r\nSuch dainties demanded expert cooking. We found in our house a portly\r\nfamily servant, \"Aunt Susan,\" who had been left as caretaker with\r\npermission to remain or not as the new tenant should please, or as she\r\nherself should please. I fell in love with her on sight and found her\r\nwilling to engage with me.\r\n\r\n\"Can you cook, Aunt Susan?\" I imprudently inquired.\r\n\r\n\"No'm, I don't call myself a cook, but I know a hogfish from a\r\nyellow-bellied perch, and a canvasback duck from a redhead. I could cook\r\noysters to suit my own white folks.\"\r\n\r\nWe had brought with us a number of servants who had lived with us in\r\nVirginia. They were free. We never owned slaves; this one free family\r\nhad served us always.\r\n\r\nA serious difficulty immediately arose in the kitchen. Susan felt her\r\ndignity insulted. She had supposed I would bring \"gentlefolks' servants\r\nfrom the Eastern Sho'.\" She had not \"counted on free niggers to put on\r\nairs an' boss her in her own kitchen.\"\r\n\r\nMy Virginia servants protested absolute humility and innocence. But\r\nthat was not all. A French woman, Adele Rivière, was sewing in the\r\nnursery, and an Englishman, George Boyd, was coachman. Susan wanted\r\n\"only one mistress,\" she had \"not counted on working for furriners. By\r\nthe time she had pleased that Frenchwoman and Englishman and them free\r\nniggers\" she \"wouldn't have enough sperrit left to wipe her foot on the\r\ndoor-mat.\"\r\n\r\nA compromise was effected, however. Susan was to be queen on her own\r\npremises; and if she _must_ occasionally \"put on airs\" herself and\r\n\"boss\" somebody, why she might always \"boss\" me.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said my friend Agnes, \"you have very neatly arranged to have\r\nas much trouble as possible. The question of caste will crop up every\r\nhour of the day. If the worst comes to the worst, let them all go except\r\nSusan! Harriet Martineau gives fine advice, for an old maid: 'Never\r\n_nag_ your servants—but if occasion demands, come down upon them like\r\nthe day of judgment.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I stand by Susan,\" I assured her, \"whatever she does. I am dreadfully\r\nopposed to capital punishment, but if anybody kills a cook, he needn't\r\nbring his case to our office.\"\r\n\r\nSusan had offended, by her assumption of superiority, all the\r\nmembers of my household except myself, to whom she was most kind and\r\nrespectful. The boy James had been brought by his aunts, who promised\r\nto train him for my service. He soon developed an ingenuity in teasing\r\nthe cook amounting to inspiration. Matters between them reached a\r\ncrisis one morning. I was reading my paper in the office adjoining\r\nthe breakfast-room when I heard Susan's raucous voice: \"What do you\r\nmean coming in this kitchen hollerin' out 'Susan, Susan'? Whar's your\r\nmanners?\"\r\n\r\n\"I loant 'em to de cook dis mornin', Susan—leastways Miss Moss! I always\r\ndisremembers yo' entitlements.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you just get out of this kitchen! I can send breakfast up on the\r\ndumb waiter. You stay in your own place.\"\r\n\r\n\"I kin make myse'f skase, Miss Moss, but dat ain't de pint. Cose de dumb\r\nwaiter can't talk, an' I has to speak about clean plates an'—\"\r\n\r\n\"Get out o' here, I tell you. _Clean_, indeed! And your face not washed\r\nthis morning! An' you all pizened up with scent like—\"\r\n\r\n\"_Lawd_, Miss Moss! _Don't_ say what I'se like! An' what I gwine fling\r\nwater in my face for? I ain' no house afire.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Susan, her ample figure endowed with a fresh white\r\napron, and her bandanna turban tied to a nicety, presented herself,\r\ndropped a courtesy, and said with perfect politeness:—\r\n\r\n\"Honey, I hate to worry you, but I'm afraid the time has come when you\r\nmust choose between me and the free nigger. I think too much of myself\r\nto mind his impudence, but everything smells and tastes of his strong\r\nscents—which I know will never suit you nor the master. I, for one,\r\ncan't stand 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then James must leave at once,\" said I, firmly. \"He knows the perfume\r\nis forbidden, and I have myself heard his disrespectful language to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nBut James had no idea of leaving Washington and returning to the\r\nposition of knife-cleaner in the Petersburg hotel, whence I had\r\ntaken him. He experienced a total change of heart. He surrendered\r\nin magnificent style. I was too skilful a general not to press my\r\nadvantage. Then and there I confiscated his entire stock of spurious\r\nattar of rose. It could not be buried, because the court was paved;\r\nit could not be emptied in the waste-water pipes, lest we remember it\r\nforever; but I opened the doors of Susan's kitchen range, and laid it,\r\na burnt-offering to her offended dignity, upon the glowing coals. I then\r\nwent calmly in to my coffee, which had a distinctly Oriental flavor that\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThings went smoothly after this. The prevailing spirit of secession\r\nfound its way only as far as the nursery, when pretty Adele Rivière\r\nentered a convent (with but one expressed regret, that the bonnets\r\nwere so unbecoming), and a dear little genius, Annie Powers, took her\r\nplace,—coming regularly for fifty cents a day, and making me independent\r\nof the elusive dressmakers who lorded and queened it over my unhappy\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nAnd just here I feel constrained to apologize to my friend who has,\r\nat this moment, this page before him, for recording so many trifling\r\nincidents; but in painting a faithful picture of any time, the little\r\nlights and shadows cannot be left out. Nothing is unimportant. Even\r\n\r\n     \"To the God that maketh all\r\n     There is no great—there is no small,\"\r\n\r\nwords which I quote with no fear of being deemed irreverent; since the\r\ncouplet has been discovered by a sojourner in the Orient to have been\r\na petty larceny of Emerson's from the book of a Brahmin, and is not a\r\nquotation from the pen of inspiration, as we understand inspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSOCIAL LIFE DURING BUCHANAN'S ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\n\r\nWe attended Dr. Gurley's church and found that the President also had\r\ntaken a seat in that church. Our own was near the door, and for many\r\nSundays before I knew him, I was interested in seeing him enter the\r\nchurch and walk briskly up to his pew near the pulpit (while the bell\r\nwas ringing), buttoned in his broadcloth coat, wearing no overcoat in\r\nthe coldest weather. Immediately after the benediction he would walk\r\nrapidly down the aisle, the congregation standing until he passed. Miss\r\nLane attended St. John's Church, and the President was accompanied only\r\nby his secretary, Mr. Buchanan Henry. After I knew him quite well, I\r\nalways spoke to him when he passed me near the door and I sometimes\r\nventured, \"A good sermon, Mr. President!\" he never failing to reply,\r\n\"Too long, Madam, too long.\"\r\n\r\nI was leading a very happy domestic life, busy with my little boys\r\nand my housekeeping, proud of my self-constituted office as my\r\nCongressman's private secretary, much exercised in sending documents,\r\nseeds, and cuttings (we were introducing tea-culture in Virginia) to\r\nhis constituents, when I was called to order by our dear old friend,\r\nMr. Dudley Mann, an old politician, diplomat, and \"society man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam, did you come to Washington to live in your own house and write\r\nletters to farmers?\"\r\n\r\n\"What better could I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"The President does not agree with you. He admires your husband and\r\nwonders why you were not at the Levee. He has asked me to see that you\r\ncome to the next one.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be on a committee that night,\" said my Congressman, hastily,—he\r\nwas usually on a committee when a reception was to the fore.\r\n\r\n\"I will take her myself,\" said Mr. Mann. \"Now, wear a pretty evening\r\ndress of silk or velvet. Can it be lavender? And I will call precisely\r\nat nine.\"\r\n\r\nI appreciated the honor of Mr. Mann's escort, and, wishing to please\r\nhim, procured the lavender silk. Our evening gowns were cut straight\r\nacross the neck, and finished with a bertha of lace. The full skirt\r\nwas distended over a large hoop. An elaborate headdress of flowers or\r\nmarabout feathers was _de rigueur_ for a levee, which, however, demanded\r\nsimpler attire than a ball or a dinner. Our white gloves were short\r\nand were finished at the wrist with a fall of lace three or four inches\r\nwide, and a band of ribbon and rosette.\r\n\r\nMr. Mann approved my attire and gave me a very good time. The crowd was\r\ngreat and the amplitude and length of the ladies' robes filled me with\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Mr. Mann,\" I said, \"pray be careful not to tread on the trains.\"\r\n\r\n\"My child,\" he answered, \"I haven't lifted my feet for twenty years!\"\r\n\r\nThe President detained us for a few courteous words, and we were passed\r\non to Miss Lane, standing, not beside him, but in a group with other\r\nladies. Thence we found our way to the East Room, and a great many\r\nladies and gentlemen were introduced to me, as I stood on the arm of my\r\ncourtly escort.\r\n\r\nSuch a number of cards came to us after this that the housekeeping, the\r\nwriting, the little boys, the seeds, and the tea-culture in Virginia\r\nwere likely to suffer.\r\n\r\nThe reign of the \"afternoon tea\" was not yet—at least not in Washington;\r\nbut entertainments included morning receptions, evening receptions,\r\ndinners, musicales, children's parties, old-fashioned evening parties\r\nwith music and supper, and splendid balls. So many of these were crowded\r\ninto a season that we often attended three balls in one evening.\r\n\r\nThe first time I dined with the President I made early and elaborate\r\npreparation. When the great day arrived, all my paraphernalia, rosetted\r\nslippers, gloves, fan, dress, and wrap were duly laid out on my bed and\r\nsofa. In the evening I seated myself at a dressing table and submitted\r\nmy head to François' hands. The evening coiffure was elaborate and\r\ntroublesome. The hair in front was stiffened with bandoline, and formed\r\ninto sleek, smooth bandeaux, framing the face. Behind, all the hair was\r\ntightly tied, low at the nape of the neck, then divided into two parts,\r\nand each woven with many strands into a wide braid. These were curved\r\nfrom ear to ear to form a basket, and within the basket were roses, or\r\npond-lilies, or violets, with long trailing vines floating behind.\r\n\r\nFrançois was a very agreeable talker. He had dressed Rachel's hair and\r\nwas leisurely giving a charming lecture on Rachel's art. Suddenly my\r\nhusband burst in: \"The carriage is at the door! Hurry, hurry! We've only\r\nten minutes to reach the White House.\"\r\n\r\nI literally leaped into my gown, had no time for flowers or jewels,\r\nsnatched up my gloves, left everything else, and ran! We entered the\r\ngreen room just as Mr. Buchanan Henry was arranging the guests for\r\ndinner. Luckily I was low down on his list.\r\n\r\nI was miserably heated, and very uncomfortable lest I should not be able\r\nto conceal my Congress gaiters, having had no time to change them. My\r\ngloves were on, but not buttoned. To add to my misfortunes I found I\r\nwas to be taken in by a Southern Congressman who was already—well, not\r\nexactly himself. To my horror he winked at Miss Lane when he drank wine\r\nwith her. When a side dish was handed, he said audibly: \"Now look here,\r\nJoe! Is that the same old thing you gave me here last year? Because\r\nif it is, I don't want any of it.\" After we returned to the parlor I\r\nconfided my miseries to the lady who had been placed next him at dinner,\r\nand she reassured me: \"Oh, that's nothing! Such things happen here any\r\nday—nobody notices these people from the rural districts.\"\r\n\r\nThis was worse than the ramshackle carriage. Could I bear to be classed\r\nwith \"people from the rural districts?\" I was never a moment late\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\nDinners at the White House were much less elaborate in their\r\nappointments than were dinners at the homes of the wealthy Cabinet\r\nofficers and Senators. Mr. Buchanan set an example of Republican\r\nsimplicity. Few flowers were placed in the drawing rooms. In the centre\r\nof the Blue Room there was a divan surrounding a stand of potted plants\r\nand surmounted by a small palm. The dinner table was not ornamented\r\nwith flowers, nor were bouquets at the covers. A long plateau, a mirror\r\nedged with a hunting scene (gilt figures in high relief), extended down\r\nthe middle, and from the centre and at the two ends rose epergnes with\r\nsmall crystal dishes for bonbons and cakes.\r\n\r\nOne evening the President said to me, \"Madam, what is this small shrub\r\nI find always placed before me?\"\r\n\r\n\"If the berries were white, Mr. President, it would be _Ardisia alba_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" he answered, \"I am all right! My berries are red—I have '_Ardisia\r\nrufa_!' Miss Harriet has the _alba_!\"\r\n\r\nThere were no other floral decorations on the table.\r\n\r\nI once ventured to send the President a Virginia ham, with particular\r\ndirections for cooking it. It was to be soaked, boiled gently three or\r\nfour hours, suffered to get cold in its own juices, and then toasted.\r\n\r\nThis would seem simple enough, but the executive cook disdained it,\r\nperhaps for the reason that it was so simple. The dish, a shapeless,\r\njellylike mass, was placed before the President. He took his knife\r\nand fork in hand to honor the dish by carving it himself, looked at\r\nit helplessly, and called out—\"Take it away! Take it away! Oh, Miss\r\nHarriet! You are a poor housekeeper! Not even a Virginia lady can teach\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThe glass dishes of the epergne contained wonderful \"French\r\nkisses\"—two-inch squares of crystallized sugar wrapped in silver paper,\r\nand elaborately decorated with lace and artificial flowers. I was\r\nvery proud at one dinner when the President said to me, \"Madam, I am\r\nsending you a souvenir for your little daughter,\" and a waiter handed\r\nme one of those gorgeous affairs. He had questioned me about my boys,\r\nand I had told him of my daughter Gordon, eight years old, who lived\r\nwith her grandmother. \"You must bring her to see Miss Harriet,\" he had\r\nsaid—which, in due season, I did; an event, with its crowning glory of a\r\nchecked silk dress, white hat and feather, which she proudly remembers\r\nto this day. Having been duly presented at court, the little lady\r\nwas much \"in society\" and accompanied me to many brilliant afternoon\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nShe was a thoughtful listener to the talk in her father's library, and\r\nonce when an old politician spoke sadly of a possible rupture of the\r\nUnited States, surprised and delighted him by slipping her hand in his\r\nand saying, \"Never mind! _United_ will spell _Untied_ just as well\"—a\r\nlittle _mot_ which was remembered and repeated long afterwards.\r\n\r\nMr. Buchanan's kind notice of her is gratefully recollected. It was said\r\nthat he was influenced by the Southern Senators and Representatives. I\r\nonly know he was most kind to us, and I refuse to believe we were of\r\nconsequence enough to make this kindness a matter of policy. I would\r\nfain think he really liked us, really desired to add to our happiness.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that his niece, Miss Harriet Lane, although\r\nuniversally admired, was a popular woman. She lacked magnetism. She\r\nfollowed a prescribed rule of manner from which she never deviated, no\r\nmatter with whom she was thrown. This was, perhaps, fortunate. Always\r\ncourteous, always in place, silent whenever it was possible to be\r\nsilent, watchful, and careful, she made no enemies, was betrayed into\r\nno entangling alliances, and was involved in no contretemps of any kind.\r\n\r\nShe was very handsome, a fair, blue-eyed, self-contained young woman.\r\nShe was dignified—as indeed all women had to be, in gesture at least,\r\nwhen they wore great hoops! The \"curtsy\" was a perilous duty. \"How\r\ndoes she do it? She never makes a cheese of herself,\" said one, looking\r\non at a morning reception. Miss Lane's courtesy was the perfection of\r\ndeference and grace. And she had exquisite taste in dress. She never\r\nwore many ornaments, many flowers, nor the billows of ruffles then in\r\nfashion. I remember her in white tulle, with a wreath of clematis; in\r\nsoft brown or blue silk; in much white muslin, dotted and plain, with\r\nblue ribbons run in puffs on skirt and bodice.\r\n\r\nShe was very affable and agreeable, in an unemotional way—the proper\r\nmanner, of course, for her. I imagine no one could take a liberty with\r\nher then, but I risked the experiment some years ago when we spent\r\na summer together at Bar Harbor. A handsome widow, with silver hair,\r\nshe was even more _distingué_ than she had been in the White House. I\r\nrecalled, to her genuine amusement, two incidents of her life there.\r\nWhen she took her place as mistress of the Executive Mansion, the\r\nPresident had given her but one rule for her conduct: never under any\r\ncircumstances to accept a present. \"Think of my feelings,\" she had said\r\nto me, \"when the lovely lacquered boxes and tables the Japanese Embassy\r\nbrought me were turned from the door, to say nothing of the music-boxes\r\nand these fascinating sewing-machines they have just invented.\"\r\n\r\nA party was once made up for a visit to Mount Vernon. Mr. Augustus\r\nSchell of New York accompanied Miss Lane. He was a fine-looking fellow\r\nand very much in love with her. As they walked along the banks of\r\nthe Potomac, she picked up a handful of colored pebbles. Mr. Schell\r\nrequested them of her and put them in his pocket. He took them to\r\nTiffany, had them beautifully polished, set with diamonds, and linked\r\ntogether in a bracelet, and sent them as \"a souvenir of Mount Vernon\"\r\nto Miss Lane for a Christmas gift.\r\n\r\nShe carried them for a week in her pocket, trying to get her own consent\r\nto give them up. The more she looked at them the better she liked them.\r\nOne day the President was in fine spirits. He liked to rally her about\r\nLord Lyons, which she did not fancy overmuch. But this time she humored\r\nhim, and at last ventured to say, \"Uncle Buchanan, if I have a few\r\npretty pebbles given me, you do not object to my accepting them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, Miss Harriet! Keep your pebbles! Keep your pebbles,\" he\r\nexclaimed, in high good humor.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" Miss Lane said, in telling me the story at the time,\r\n\"diamonds are pebbles.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an impression that she never condescended to the rôle of a\r\ncoquette, but I could testify to the contrary.\r\n\r\nMr. Porcher Miles, Congressman from South Carolina, was one of her train\r\nof devoted admirers. He accompanied me once to an evening reception at\r\nthe White House. Miss Lane stood in front of the flower-trimmed divan\r\nin the Blue Room. Mr. Miles and I paid our respects, lingered awhile,\r\nand, having other engagements, sent for our carriage.\r\n\r\nAs we stood at the door waiting, he talked of Miss Lane's beauty and\r\ncharm—\"Look at her where she stands! Is she not the personification of\r\na high-bred lady from head to foot?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Lane perceived we were talking about her,—and while she gave\r\nher right hand to the arriving guests she passed her left behind her\r\nand plucked a spray of mignonette. We saw her beckon a servant, who\r\nimmediately found us, and gave the flowers to Mr. Miles, \"with Miss\r\nLane's compliments.\"\r\n\r\nI repeated these two little stories to her when her head was\r\nsilvered,—less by age than by sorrow,—and awoke one of those rare\r\nmoonlight smiles which her friends remember so well.\r\n\r\nNo one who observed Mr. Buchanan could fail to perceive the rapid change\r\nin him after he became President. Having committed himself to the policy\r\nof rotation in office, he was overwhelmed with the persistence of place\r\nhunters. \"They give me no time to say my prayers,\" he complained. They\r\nexhausted him in listening to their petty interests at a time when the\r\nmost important problems that ever confronted the head of the nation\r\nclamored for his consideration.\r\n\r\nToward the last, when the older men almost gave up hope, his only prayer\r\nwas that the catastrophe of conflict might not come in his day. He\r\ncannot be blamed above others for hesitation, vacillation. The problems\r\nwere too mighty for one man's wisdom, too mighty for the collective\r\nwisdom of many.\r\n\r\nLord and Lady Napier were interesting members of Washington society.\r\nThey occupied the house built by Admiral Porter on H Street, near\r\nFourteenth, now the residence of the French Embassy. They had succeeded\r\nMr. Crampton, and were themselves succeeded in 1859 by Lord Lyons—so\r\nwe had three British Ministers within a few years. Lord and Lady Napier\r\ngave delightful entertainments—dinners, musicales, receptions, evening\r\nparties. My Lady was more admired than were any of her predecessors. She\r\nwas lovely in person, gentle, cultivated, most affable and approachable.\r\nAt her receptions, and even at her balls, her sons, charming boys of\r\nten and twelve, were always present to help her receive her guests.\r\nEverything she did, everything she said, seemed wisest, virtuousest,\r\ndiscreetest, best. We have had no representative from the court of St.\r\nJames who did so much for the entertainment of our own people as Lord\r\nand Lady Napier.\r\n\r\nThey gave a splendid ball in 1858 in honor of the queen's birthday.\r\nLady Napier was superb in a tiara of diamonds and emeralds. Lord\r\nNapier and all the foreign Ministers shone forth in all the splendor\r\nof court dress; and everybody must concede—Mr. Marcy to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding—that the glitter of gold lace and gems, the distinction\r\nof orders, the imperial stars and decorations, do add to the interest\r\nof such an occasion. They mean much. They mean honor achieved, services\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\nA recording Jenkins of this ball dilates upon the elegance of the\r\nsupper, \"this vista of gold and silver plate and the more than epicurean\r\ndaintiness of the delicacies, the age and vintage of the wines.\"\r\n\r\nThe most interesting ball of the season was that given by the Senators\r\nand Representatives to Lord and Lady Napier just before they returned\r\nto England.\r\n\r\nWe were early arrivals at this ball, because we wished to see the\r\nsanded floor of the ball room, representing in colors St. George and\r\nthe Dragon, before it should be effaced by the dancers.\r\n\r\nLord and Lady Napier were seated on a dais at the head of the room, and\r\nwe passed in review before them. Lady Napier was attired in rich white\r\nsatin, embroidered with pearls, with a close \"Juliet cap\" of pearls\r\non her hair. No lofty throne could make her less gracious than was her\r\nwont.\r\n\r\nDion Boucicault gave me his arm at the door, and after our obeisance\r\nwalked around the room to show me the portraits and paintings. On\r\nthe right of Lord and Lady Napier was a full-length portrait of\r\nyoung Victoria in her ermine robe and crown, and on the left, one of\r\nWashington. \"Alas, alas,\" said Mr. Boucicault, \"that so great a man\r\nshould have been painted with cramp in his fingers!\" My escort was\r\naltogether charming. I discovered he was \"putting in time\" with me,\r\nfor presently here came little Agnes Robertson, just from the theatre,\r\nwhere she had been playing in the \"Siege of Lucknow,\" and I lost Mr.\r\nBoucicault! He married her soon afterward. And _afterward_! Ah, well!\r\nThat is none of the business of this story.\r\n\r\nWhen we entered the banquet hall, Lady Napier's exclamations were\r\nenthusiastic. \"Look, George,\" she cried, \"there is the knight and\r\nhis dragon again—all in sugar! And here are the English arms and—oh,\r\nGeorge! here are our own arms!\" Gautier had excelled himself. There were\r\nglittering haystacks of spun sugar; wonderful Roman chariots, drawn by\r\nswans, and driven by Cupids; pyramids of costly bonbons; dolphins in a\r\nsea of rock candy; and ices in every form from a pair of turtle doves\r\nto a pillared temple. Gautier spread all his tables in this fashion,\r\nthe grosser dishes of game, terrapin, and canvasback being served from\r\na buffet.\r\n\r\nWashington suppers in the fifties were superb. One wondered if we might\r\nnot some day return to the feasts of the Roman emperors, the tables of\r\ncedar and ivory incrusted with jewels, the movable ceilings representing\r\nthe celestial spheres, the showers of violets and roses which rained\r\ndown on the guests in the intervals between the courses of peacocks'\r\nbrains and nightingales' tongues, the trumpets which greeted the\r\nappearance of the stuffed peacocks with spread plumage. Time has really\r\nchanged our supper fashions less than we imagine. Music, delicate wines,\r\nconfectionery in fanciful forms, silver dishes, flowers, perfumed water\r\nfor the fingers, were all fashionable in the fourteenth century. We\r\nsmile to read of the flocks of living birds and the stuffed fowls that\r\nadorned the boards of the Neapolitan kings. But it has not been many\r\nyears since, at a banquet given in New York to Ex-President Cleveland\r\nby the Manhattan Club, a tank was placed in the middle of the table\r\nwhere living terrapins crawled about and were thoughtful spectators of\r\nthe fate of the _terrapin à la Maryland_. And at intervals around the\r\nboard, stuffed pheasants contemplated the flight of the _faisan rôti_\r\ndown Democratic throats. Benedetti Salutati in 1476 never did better\r\nthan this. And, compared with these ancients and moderns, M. Gautier was\r\nextremely refined, and only a bit anachronistic with his Roman chariots,\r\nCupids, and swans.\r\n\r\nPeople were wont to remark upon the atmosphere the lovely Lady Napier\r\nseemed to bring with her everywhere. Those who were admitted into her\r\n_sanctum sanctorum_, her little boudoir, fancied they could explain it.\r\nUpon her table was much silver marked with her coronet and initials, and\r\nbeside these was a rosewood book rack containing half a dozen volumes—a\r\nBible, a \"Treatise on Practical Religion,\" \"The Mount of Olivet,\"\r\n\"Paradise of the Christian Soul,\" \"The Christian Year,\" \"Child's\r\nCatechism,\" \"Life of Dean Ramsey.\" These were the pure waters from\r\nwhich Lady Napier drank daily. \"Ninia Napier\" was written in a delicate\r\nItalian hand on the fly-leaf of each volume.\r\n\r\nMy acquaintance with Lord Napier was slight. Judge Douglas introduced\r\nhim to me at a ball. He stood some seconds without speaking. At last he\r\nraised his cold blue eyes and asked, \"Have you been long at this place?\"\r\nI answered, \"No, my Lord!\" Ten words had passed between us, with which\r\nhe seemed to be satisfied. But Lady Napier I knew well. She returned\r\nall visits, and mine among the rest.\r\n\r\nEngland and Russia had been at war, and peace had recently been\r\nconcluded. Of all the foreign Ministers I knew best the English and\r\nRussian. Baron Stoëckle, then the Russian Envoy, and Baron Bodisco, his\r\npredecessor (I am not sure about the \"Baron\"), I knew very well, and I\r\ncordially liked their wives. This does not imply that their wives, both\r\nAmerican, liked each other.\r\n\r\nMadame Bodisco, laden with diamonds, looked with disfavor upon Madame\r\nStoëckle, young, blue-eyed, and in simple attire. The latter was from\r\nMassachusetts; the former had been a beautiful Georgetown girl, whom\r\nthe baron, passing her father's orchard, had spied in a blossoming apple\r\ntree, and to whom he had forthwith lost his Russian and baronial heart.\r\nMadame Bodisco was an enthusiastic Southern sympathizer. At Madame\r\nStoëckle's own table, after she had related an amusing anecdote, Madame\r\nBodisco whispered to me, \"Will you listen to that Yankee woman with her\r\n'_says she's_' and '_says I's_'!\"\r\n\r\nOf course politics, in this seething time, were never alluded to in any\r\ncompany, least of all in the presence of our foreign envoys. It required\r\nskill; but we kept the talk upon \"literature and flowers,\" the birds\r\nand fishes of different lands, anything, everything, except the topic\r\nof all-consuming interest. But at one of Baron Stoëckle's very genial\r\ndinners, one of us, to test his ingenuity, said: \"Come now, Baron! Here\r\nwe are, Republican and Democrat! Show your colors! Where do you belong?\"\r\n\"Alas, dear lady,\" said the wily diplomat, \"I am an orphan! I belong\r\nnowhere! I am an _Old-Line Whig_.\" This party had just become extinct.\r\n\r\nOne of the exciting events during the Buchanan administration was the\r\narrival in Washington of the first embassy from Japan—the Japan which\r\nfor hundreds of years had been governed by the dominant idea: \"to\r\npreserve unchanged the condition of the native intelligence\" and to\r\n\"prevent the introduction of new ideas.\" The government had maintained\r\na rigid policy of isolation, \"living like frogs in a well,\" until 1853,\r\nwhen they were rudely awakened from their dream of peace and security\r\nby Commodore Perry sailing into the harbor of Yokohama with a squadron\r\nof United States war vessels. By dignity, resolution, argument, and\r\npromise, he extorted a treaty in 1854—and thus Japan entered the family\r\nof nations.\r\n\r\nWe had much curiosity about the Japanese. We read Perry's \"Expedition\"\r\nwith keen interest, and were delighted with the prospect of receiving\r\nthe embassy from the new land. Arrangements were made for a series of\r\nentertainments, invitations were already issued—one to the White House\r\nto witness the presentation of credentials and the reception of the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nAt last we heard that the strangers had landed and would soon arrive.\r\nI was in the gallery of the Senate Chamber with an intimate friend.\r\nWe were doubtful about going out with the crowd of citizens to meet\r\nthe Japanese, and were hoping that the Senate and House would adjourn.\r\nPresently a member rose and said: \"Mr. President, the first Ambassadors\r\nfrom the venerable country of Japan are about to arrive. I move the\r\nSenate do now adjourn to meet and welcome the Japanese.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately another Senator was on his feet, not to second the motion,\r\nbut to say sharply, \"Mr. President, I humbly trust the Senate of the\r\nUnited States of America will not adjourn for every show that comes\r\nalong.\" That settled it. My friend and I hurried to our carriage, and\r\nmeeting the cortège, turned just in time to drive side by side with the\r\nfirst landau containing the Ambassadors.\r\n\r\nOur progress was slow and often interrupted—and we had abundant time\r\nto observe the two dignitaries close beside us in the first carriage.\r\nThey sat, fanning themselves, without looking to right or left. The\r\none next me was extremely wrinkled and withered—doubtless the greater\r\nman—and he was so wooden, so destitute of expression that I—oh, this\r\nis _much_ worse than the episode of the ramshackle hack! How can I\r\nconfess that I \"lost my head.\" The old creature, with his wrinkled,\r\nyellow face, turban, short gown, and petticoats looked so very like my\r\nold mulatto mammy, the darling of my childhood, that—I leaned over and\r\nput my pearl-handled fan on his knee, motioning to him to give me his\r\nin exchange. The old gentleman looked startled for an instant, but he\r\nsoon understood, and I became the first possessor of a Japanese fan.\r\nBut then a strange thing happened! I was suddenly overwhelmed with\r\nconfusion and sank back beside my companion, pulling her parasol well\r\nover my face. \"Was it so dreadful?\" I implored. \"I'm afraid it was,\"\r\nsaid she. \"Hide your fan from the others. We will never tell.\" Presently\r\nshe added, thoughtfully, \"I wonder what your Aunt Mary would say?\" I\r\ndid not wonder. I knew perfectly well what my Aunt Mary would say.\r\n\r\nAll of which goes to prove that it was lucky my husband had not taken\r\nhis wife to Greece, and had not accepted the mission to Persia which\r\nwas offered him. He had a wife, unfortunately, who might on provocation\r\nlose her head.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we repaired to the White House to help receive the\r\nJapanese Embassy. Mr. Buchanan would have done well to select his guests\r\nwith regard to their slimness. The East Room was packed. Ranging on\r\neither side according to our rank, the Congressmen found themselves near\r\nthe wall. We mounted our smallest representative, Mr. Boyce, on the\r\nlow mantelpiece behind some palms with instructions to peep and tell\r\nus everything he saw. \"What are they doing now, Mr. Boyce?\" \"Oh, it's\r\ngrand! They bow, and then they bow again!\" \"Well, what are they saying?\r\nWhat are they doing now?\" \"They are still bowing, and 'old Buck,' God\r\nbless him, is bowing too.\" The ceremony was long. The murmured voices\r\nwere low. One might have imagined one's self at a funeral.\r\n\r\nThe Belgian Baron de Limbourg gave a fine garden party to the strangers.\r\nThe Baron considered himself on the entertainment committee as he had\r\nrecently married the daughter of our Secretary of State, Mr. Cass.\r\nThere were large grounds around his residence, and these he lighted with\r\nJapanese lanterns, dotting the lawn all over with pretty tents, in which\r\nyoung girls costumed to represent the peasants of various countries\r\nserved ices and confections. The large area in the rear was converted\r\nby carpets, hangings, and divans into a luxurious Turkish smoking den.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese always presented a pretty work-box, filled with curious\r\nsilks, to the ladies who entertained them. They would then range\r\nthemselves on the seats prepared for them and look on silently, with\r\nhalf-shut eyes and expressionless faces. The dancing delighted them.\r\n\"How much are the women paid?\" ventured one, and was amazed to find\r\nthey danced for pleasure only. A tiny, round-faced boy was always of\r\nthe party. We sometimes spoke to him, and he invariably answered \"all\r\nright,\" until he was known as \"Little All Right,\" and, as he was the\r\nonly gracious one of the whole party, he became a favorite.\r\n\r\nThe Prince de Joinville attended Madame de Limbourg's fête. During the\r\nafternoon our host sent for me, and I was conducted to an alcove where\r\nthe Prince, Miss Lane, Lord Lyons, and some of the Cabinet ladies were\r\ngathered around a little bottle of wine, which was, we were told, old,\r\nold Rose wine—costing so much that now, what with interest and compound\r\ninterest, every drop was worth—I forget how much! And we were to drink\r\nMiss Lane's health. \"And I!\"—she protested. \"I cannot drink my own\r\nhealth! Am I to have no wine?\" Whereupon she was conjured to think her\r\nown toast—and we would, not knowing her thought, drink it with her.\r\n\r\nIt was supposed that Lord Lyons was her suitor, and we were persuaded\r\nthat the President desired her to marry him. But nobody knows the heart\r\nof the king, nor the heart of the President (who fills in some sort\r\na king's position), still less the heart of the President's pretty\r\nniece—least of all the heart of a wily diplomat! We only know she\r\nmarried one of her own countrymen—and as to Lord Lyons, we lost him for\r\ngood and all when the dreadful war came.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nGAY SOCIAL LIFE IN WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rolls of the Supreme Court, Senate, and House of Representatives\r\npresented a list of great names in 1854-1860. It would seem that our\r\ncountry, knowing herself to be in mortal danger, had summoned the wisest\r\nof her sons for conference and council: Rufus Choate, Curtis, Seward,\r\nDouglas, Jefferson Davis, Salmon Chase, Sumner, Hale, Toombs, Hunter,\r\nRobert J. Walker, and the brilliant men of the lower House; all these\r\nwere present at the great consultation.\r\n\r\nOf these men the most interesting, picturesque, and prominent was\r\nundoubtedly Stephen A. Douglas. His political career is known to a\r\nworld which is still divided in opinion of him. Was his fevered life the\r\nresult of patriotism, or of personal ambition? The world still assumes\r\nthe power to read, with a magnifying glass, the inner workings of the\r\nhuman mechanism, and to put its discerning finger on the spring of human\r\nactions. Who has ever seen the heart of another? Who knows his own?\r\nBy their works ye shall know them, not by their impulses, not by their\r\nstruggles with the diverse machinery within them.\r\n\r\nOne who liked not Stephen A. Douglas has thus described him. \"Erect,\r\ncompact, aggressive. A personage truly to be questioned timidly, to\r\nbe approached advisedly. Here indeed was a lion, by the very look of\r\nhim master of himself and of others. By reason of its regularity and\r\nmasculine strength, a handsome face. A man of the world to the cut of\r\nthe coat across the broad shoulders. Here was one to lift a youngster\r\ninto the realm of emulation, like a character in a play, to arouse\r\ndreams of Washington and its Senators and great men. For this was one\r\nto be consulted by the great alone. A figure of dignity and power with\r\nthe magnetism to compel moods. Since, when he smiled you warmed in spite\r\nof yourself, and when he frowned the world looked grave.\"\r\n\r\nThis was Stephen A. Douglas. The picture is a true one. What wonder that\r\nhe should have captivated my husband and myself, scarcely more than half\r\nhis age? The warmest friendship grew up between us.\r\n\r\nI remember well my own first interview with him in Washington. At a\r\ncrowded ball, I had found a chair outside the crush, when he approached\r\nwith a bottle of champagne and a glass in his hands. \"I need no\r\nintroduction, Madam,\" he said. \"I am sure you cannot have forgotten\r\nthe man who met you a few years ago in the little Petersburg hotel\r\nand told you how like you are to the Empress Eugénie. No? I thought\r\nnot,\" laughed the judge, \"and yet she isn't a priming to our own women!\r\nNow,\" he added, bending down and speaking gravely, \"I shall send Mrs.\r\nDouglas to see you. I wish you to be friends. Not pasteboard friends,\r\nwith only a bit of cardboard passing between you now and then, but real\r\ngood friends, meeting often and being much together.\" Just here, as he\r\npoised his bottle to fill my glass, his elbow was jostled, and down came\r\nthe foaming champagne, over my neck and shoulders and the front of my\r\ndress. The friendship was christened—the bottle broken on the new ship!\r\n\"Don't worry about the gown! You have excuse now to buy another,\" said\r\nthe judge, as I gasped when the icy flood ran down my bosom.\r\n\r\nHe had lately married his second wife, the belle of Washington,\r\nbeautiful Adele Cutts; tall, stately, and fair exceedingly. She was a\r\ngreat-niece of Dolley Madison. We met often, and it came to pass that\r\n\"the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not impress one as having what we call \"depth of character,\"\r\nwhat is commonly implied in the term \"superior,\" not a woman to assume\r\nto lead and teach other women—a character less lovable often than the\r\nwoman who knows herself to be of like weaknesses with ourselves. But\r\nshe was beautiful as a pearl, sunny-tempered, unselfish, warmhearted,\r\nunaffected, sincere. She was very attentive to her \"little giant.\" When\r\nhe made those terribly long speeches in the Senate, on the Lecompton\r\nConstitution, on the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, on popular sovereignty,\r\nshe would wait in the gallery and hurry down to wrap his overcoat\r\naround him, as he stood in the hall dripping with perspiration. She\r\nimbibed enough political lingo to rally and amuse him. Some workmen\r\nhaving arrived to erect a platform in his ball room for musicians, she\r\nexclaimed: \"Oh, Judge Douglas! What is a platform? They are going to\r\nbring one into this house, and we shall be flayed alive or murdered in\r\nour beds!\"\r\n\r\nI said to her once: \"You know you are not really handsomer than the rest\r\nof us! Why do people say so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I never trick myself out in diamonds, or have more than one\r\ncolor in a gown. An artist told me once that all those things spoiled\r\na picture.\"\r\n\r\nShe would have liked the diamonds as well as the rest of us, and\r\nonce said so to her husband. \"Oh, no!\" he answered, \"diamonds are the\r\nconsolation of old wives, a diamond for a wrinkle!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Douglas was the first of the Washington ladies who adopted the\r\nfashion of closing her shutters in the early afternoon and lighting\r\nher rooms with gas. She was delighted as a child with the effect and\r\nindulged in a preliminary waltz with me before the company arrived.\r\n\"O dear!\" she exclaimed, suddenly, \"what am I to do with this _awful_\r\npicture of Judge Douglas's? I daren't take it away because he bought\r\nit for his first wife; and when old Mrs. Martin pounces down upon us to\r\nsee how we are spending her grandchildren's money, she will miss it, and\r\nthink I've sold it! But isn't it _awful_? Do spread out your flounces\r\nin front of it as well as you can.\" The noonday lighting of her rooms\r\nwas a great success. Lord Lyons looked up and spoke of the beauty of\r\nthe starlit night, adding \"and there's a fine moon out of doors.\" John\r\nG. Saxe was one of the guests—and his merry hostess introduced him as\r\n\"deserving capital punishment for making people laugh themselves to\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\nI have had occasion to allude so often to the costumes of the ladies\r\nof Mr. Buchanan's administration, that I have resolved boldly to ask\r\nmy reader to accompany me for a few minutes to Vanity Fair, as, guided\r\nby society reports of the period, I describe the dresses worn by the\r\nleaders of fashion. I suppose the journals of our day would not print\r\ncolumns on columns describing the gowns worn at balls, unless there were\r\nsome sure to read. Costume has always interested the world. It is still\r\na question whether costume influences character, or _vice versa_. And\r\nyet one regrets to treat charming women as though they were lay figures.\r\n\r\nThere will be a great deal of sorrowful record in this book. Let us\r\nlinger awhile on the flowery brink, before we reach the time when the\r\nnoise of angry waters will be too loud to be hushed by the frou-frou\r\nof a lady's silken gown. Moreover, there are always mistakes and\r\nmisconceptions to be corrected and set right. Have I not just read\r\nin a New York daily paper of the ugly fashions of the Washington of\r\nthe times just before the war—the \"great hoops, gowns of reps, the\r\nhideous tints of red, the Congress gaiters; how nobody wore a ball\r\ngown costing more than $55,\" etc., etc.? The Congress gaiters must be\r\nacknowledged, the hoops also, but perhaps they may all come again; and\r\nthen some beauty like the empress of the French may arise to make them\r\nbeautiful. They _were_ large! Beside them Queen Elizabeth's farthingale\r\nwas an insignificant circumstance. The belle in the fifties lived in\r\nan expansive time. There was still plenty of room in the world. Houses\r\nwere broad and low, carriages were broad and low, furniture was massive.\r\nEven a small pier glass was broadened by great scrolls of mahogany.\r\nDrawing-rooms were filled with vast arm-chairs, sofas, and tables. The\r\nlegs of pianos were made as massive as possible.\r\n\r\nLadies wore enormous hoops, and because their heads looked like small\r\nhandles to huge bells, they widened the coiffure into broad bandeaux\r\nand braids, loaded it with garlands of flowers, and enlarged it by\r\nmeans of a wide head-dress of tulle, lace, and feathers, or crowned it\r\nwith a coal-scuttle bonnet tied under the chin with wide ribbons. In\r\nthis guise they sailed fearlessly about, with no danger of jostling a\r\nneighbor or overturning the furniture. They had not then filled their\r\nrooms with spider-legged chairs and tables, nor crowded the latter with\r\nfrail toys and china. Now that so many of these things are imported, now\r\nthat the world is so full of people,—in the streets, cars, theatres, at\r\nreceptions,—milady has found she must reef her sails. Breadth was the\r\nambition of 1854—length and slimness the supreme attainment of 1904.\r\nWhat would the modern belle look like, among all these skyscrapers, in\r\na hoop? Like a ball—nothing more.\r\n\r\nFinding herself with all this amplitude, milady of the fifties essayed\r\ngorgeous decoration. She had stretched a large canvas; she now covered\r\nit with pictures—bouquets and baskets of flowers appeared on the\r\nwoollens for house dresses; on the fine gauzes and silks one might find\r\nexcellent representations of the Lake of Geneva, with a distant view of\r\nthe Swiss mountains.\r\n\r\nWhen a lady ordered a costume for a ball, her flowers arrived in a box\r\nlarger than the glazed boxes of to-day in which modistes send home our\r\ngowns. The garniture included a wreath for the hair, with bunches at\r\nthe back from which depended trailing vines. The _bouquet de corsage_\r\nsometimes extended to each shoulder. Bouquets were fastened on gloves\r\nat the wrist, wreaths trailed down the skirt, wreaths looped the double\r\nskirt in festoons. Only one kind of flower was considered in good\r\ntaste. Milady must look like a basket of shaded roses, or lilies, or\r\npomegranates, or violets. Ropes of wax beads were sometimes substituted\r\nfor flowers.\r\n\r\nI once entered a milliner's shop—not my dear Madame Delarue's—and in\r\nthe centre of the room, suspended by a wire from the ceiling, was one\r\nof these huge garnitures—all tied together and descending down to the\r\nfloor. \"This, Madame,\" I said, \"is something very _recherché_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Madame! That is the rarest parure I have. There was never one like\r\nit. There will never be another.\"\r\n\r\nI scrutinized the flowers, and found nothing remarkable in any way.\r\n\r\n\"That, Madame,\" continued the milliner, \"was purchased from me by the\r\nwife of Senator ——! She wore it to Mrs. Gwin's ball, and returned it to\r\nme next day. I ask no pay! I keep it for the sake of Mrs. Senator ——,\r\nthat I may have the honor of exhibiting it to my patrons.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no reason, because we sometimes choose to swing back into\r\nthe ghastly close-fitted skirt, or to wrap ourselves like a Tanagra\r\nfigurine, that we should despise a more spacious time. Nor is it at all\r\nbeneath us to attach enough importance to dress to describe it. Witness\r\nthe recent \"Costumes of Two Centuries,\" by one of our most accomplished\r\nwriters. Witness the teachings of a theologian eighteen hundred or more\r\nyears ago, who condescended to illustrate his sermon by women's ways\r\nwith dress! Says Tertullian: \"Let simplicity be your white, charity\r\nyour vermilion; dress your eyebrows with modesty, and your lips with\r\nreservedness. Let instruction be your ear-rings, and a ruby cross the\r\nfront pin in your head; submission to your husband your best ornament.\r\nEmploy your hands in housewifely duties, and keep your feet within your\r\nown doors. Let your garments be of the silk of probity, the fine linen\r\nof sanctity, and the purple of chastity.\"\r\n\r\n\"How does that impress you for a nineteenth-century costume?\" I asked\r\nAgnes my bosom friend, to whom I read the passage aloud. \"Well,\" she\r\nreplied, \"I should be perfectly willing to try the ruby hairpin as a\r\nbeginning—and get Clagett to order the new brand of silk, which sounds\r\nas if it might be a very pure article indeed and warranted to wear\r\nwell; but if you are seeking my honest opinion of Tertullian, I frankly\r\nconfess that I think our clothes and our behavior to our husbands are\r\nnone of his business.\"\r\n\r\nSociety letters of 1857 give us strictly accurate description of\r\ntoilettes, which may interest some of my readers:[3]—\r\n\r\n\"The wealth of the present Cabinet, and their elegant style of living,\r\nsets the pace for Washington soirées—equal in magnificence to the\r\ngorgeous fêtes of Versailles.\r\n\r\n\"At the Postmaster-General's the regal ball room was lined with superb\r\nmirrors from floor to ceiling. In the drawing-rooms opposite the host,\r\nhostess, and daughter and Miss Nerissa Saunders occupied the post of\r\nreceiving.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Brown was dressed in rose-colored brocade, with an exquisite\r\nresemblance of white lace stamped in white velvet, a point lace cape,\r\nand turban set with diamonds. Miss Brown wore a white silk tissue\r\nembroidered in moss rosebuds, a circlet of pearls on her hair, and\r\nnatural flowers on her bosom. Lady Napier wore white brocaded satin,\r\nwith head-dress of scarlet honeysuckle. Madame de Sartige's gown was\r\nof white embroidered crêpe, garnished with sprays of green. The wife\r\nof Senator Slidell was costumed in black velvet, trimmed with fur. Her\r\nhead-dress was of crimson velvet, rich lace, and ostrich feathers. A\r\nsuperb bandeau of pearls bound her raven hair. Miss Nerissa Saunders\r\nwas exquisite in a white silk, veiled with tulle, the skirts trimmed\r\nwith rose-colored quilling. Mrs. Senator Clay wore canary satin, covered\r\nall over with gorgeous point lace. Mrs. John J. Crittenden was superb\r\nin blue moire antique, with point lace trimmings. Mrs. General McQueen\r\nof South Carolina appeared in a white silk with cherry trimmings,\r\nher head-dress of large pearls fit for a queen. Mrs. Senator Gwin\r\nwore superb crimson moire antique with point lace, and a head-dress\r\nof feathers fastened with large diamonds. Mrs. Stephen A. Douglas, a\r\nwhite tulle dress over white silk—the overdress looped with bunches of\r\nviolets and grass, similar bunches on breast and shoulder, and trailing\r\nin her low coiffure. Mrs. Faulkner from Virginia was attired in blue\r\nsilk and Mechlin lace, her daughters in white illusion. Mrs. Reverdy\r\nJohnson was superb in lemon satin and velvet pansies. Mrs. Pringle of\r\nCharleston wore a velvet robe of lemon color; Mrs. Judge Roosevelt of\r\nNew York velvet and diamonds; Mrs. Senator Pugh of Ohio crimson velvet\r\nwith ornaments of rubies and crimson pomegranate flowers.\"\r\n\r\nThis last lady, Mrs. Pugh, wife of the Senator from Ohio, was _par\r\nexcellence_ the beauty of the day. To see her in this dress was enough\r\nto \"bid the rash gazer wipe his eye.\" Her eyes were large, dark, and\r\nmost expressive. Her hair was dark, her coloring vivid. Mrs. Douglas,\r\nMrs. Pugh, and Kate Chase were the three unapproached, unapproachable,\r\nbeauties of the Buchanan administration. The daughter of Senator Chase\r\nwas really too young to go to balls. She was extremely beautiful, \"her\r\ncomplexion was marvellously delicate, her fine features seeming to be\r\ncut from fine bisque, her eyes, bright, soft, sweet, were of exquisite\r\nblue, and her hair a wonderful color like the ripe corn-tassel in full\r\nsunlight. Her teeth were perfect. Poets sang then, and still sing, of\r\nthe turn of her beautiful neck and the regal carriage of her head.\"\r\nShe was as intellectual as she was beautiful. From her teens she had\r\nbeen initiated into political questions for which her genius and her\r\ncalm, thoughtful nature eminently fitted her. When she realized that\r\nneither party would nominate her father for President in 1860, she\r\nturned her energetic mind to the formation of plans and intrigues to\r\nobtain for him the nomination of 1868! She failed in that, she failed\r\nin everything, poor girl. She wrecked her life by a marriage with a\r\nwealthy, uncongenial governor of Rhode Island, from whom she fled with\r\nswift feet across the lawn of the beautiful home at Canonchet, and hand\r\nin hand with poverty and sorrow ended her life in obscurity.\r\n\r\nIt is going to be a long time before we again visit Vanity Fair; and\r\nlest it linger too delightfully in our memories, we must try to find\r\nsome rift in the lute, some fly in the amber—not daring, however, to\r\nlook beneath the surface.\r\n\r\nAnd so we are fain to acknowledge that the evening gowns of these fair\r\ndames were liberal only in their skirts. The bodice was _décolleté_ to\r\nthe extremest limit—as I suppose it will always be. And then, as now,—as\r\nalways,—there was no lack of wise men, usually youthful prophets, to\r\npreach against it, to read for our instruction Solomon's disrespectful\r\nallusions to jewels in the ears of fair women without discretion, and\r\nSt. Paul's well-known remarks upon our foibles. \"The idea of quoting\r\nSolomon as an authority on women,\" said my friend Agnes one day, as we\r\nwalked from church. \"I _never_ quote Solomon! He knew a good many women\r\nwithout discretion, some hundreds of them; but he didn't live up to his\r\nconvictions, and he changed his mind very often. He was to my thinking\r\nnot at all a nice person to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how about St. Paul?\" I ventured.\r\n\r\n\"I consider it very small in St. Paul to think so much about dress\r\nanyway! One would suppose the thorn in his own flesh would have made\r\nhim tender toward others; and Timothy must have been a poor creature\r\nto be taken in by 'braided hair,' 'gold and pearls, and costly array.'\r\nNow, of course, we have a few of those things, and like to wear our hair\r\nneatly; but I don't see why they are not suitable for us so long as we\r\ndon't live for them, nor seek to entangle Timothy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I replied, \"I never can feel it is at all my affair. I hear it\r\noften enough! But somehow St. Simeon Stylites, preaching away on his\r\npillar, seems a great way off, and not to know the bearings of all he\r\ntalks about. We listen to him dutifully; but I fancy if we amend our\r\nways we will do it of our own selves, and not because of St. Simeon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't mind St. Simeon,\" said my irate friend (she had worked\r\nherself up to a pitch of indignation); \"probably he was old and\r\nvenerable, and to be tolerated; but it hurts me to be preached to by a\r\nyoung thing like that minister to-day, as if I were a Babylonish woman!\r\nWe don't 'walk haughtily with stretched-forth necks, walking and mincing\r\nas we go, making a tinkling with our feet.' And as to our 'changeable\r\nsuits of apparel,' and the 'crimping pins,' do we live for these things?\r\nOur maids make a living by taking care of them while we are at church\r\nhoping to hear of something better than crimping pins.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady who expressed these heretical sentiments was, as I have\r\nremarked, my most intimate friend; and although not older than herself,\r\nI considered it my duty to reason with her. \"But you see, my dear\r\nAgnes,\" I said, \"we are obliged to be on the side of our young preacher,\r\nwhether we like it or not. He is the white-plumed champion riding forth\r\nfrom the courts of purity and beauty of behavior. We wouldn't like to\r\nbe the sable knight who emerges from the opposite direction.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would!\" declared my young rebel. \"Infantile clergymen should keep\r\nto the sins of their own sex. Nobody criticises men's dress. They\r\nare exempt. They may surround their countenances with Henry VIII\r\nruffs, which make them look like the head of John the Baptist on a\r\ncharger,—nobody calls them ridiculous. They wear the briefest surf\r\ncostumes—nobody says they are indecent.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my dear—\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my dear, I know all about the matter of evening dress. I've\r\nstudied it up. It is a time-honored fashion (I can show you all about\r\nit in my new encyclopædia). You remember I let you air your learning\r\nand quote old Tertullian. Did I look bored?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. You may tell me now. You can finish before we get home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, the _décolleté_ bodice is not a new expression of total\r\ndepravity. It is an old fashion, appearing in 1280, with stomacher\r\nof jewels. It reached England from Bohemia, but was then the fashion\r\nin Italy, Poland, and Spain. Those times were not conspicuous for\r\nsentiment, but were quite as moral as the times of the Greek chiton, or\r\nthe Roman tunic, or the Norman robe, or the Saxon gown.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" I interrupted, \"it was out of fashion in the high-necked days of\r\nQueen Elizabeth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, she had her own reasons for disliking to see a suggestive bare\r\nthroat! Queen Bess was not conspicuous for purity. Don't interrupt\r\nme—I'll prove everything by the book—lots of good women have worn\r\nlow dresses. Madame Recamier was a pretty good woman, and so were our\r\ngrandmothers, and so were the ladies of the Golden Age in Virginia who\r\nreared the boys that won our independence.\"\r\n\r\n\"All of which proves nothing,\" I declared; but we had reached our door\r\non New York Avenue, and went in for our Sunday dinner. My friend did\r\nnot inflict the encyclopædia. She had already quoted it. What was the\r\nuse? We may be sure of one thing: no fashion has ever yet been discarded\r\nbecause it was abused. No Damascus blade has ever been keen enough to\r\nlop off an offending fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF SOCIAL LIFE IN 1858—LEADERS IN SOCIETY\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were many brilliant and beautiful women who escaped the notice of\r\nthe society newsmonger of the day.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cyrus McCormick, recently married to the inventor of the great\r\nreaping machine, was one of these. Mr. McCormick, then a young man, was\r\ndestined to be decorated by many European governments and to achieve\r\na great fortune. His wife, just out of Miss Emma Willard's school,\r\nwas very beautiful, very gentle, and winning. No sheaves garnered by\r\nher husband's famous reaper can compare with the sheaves from her own\r\nsowing, during a long life devoted to good deeds.\r\n\r\nThen there were Mrs. Yulee, wife of the Senator from Florida, and her\r\nsisters, Mrs. Merrick and Mrs. Holt, all three noted for personal and\r\nintellectual charm; and beautiful Mrs. Robert J. Walker, who was perhaps\r\nthe first of the coterie to be called to make a sacrifice for her\r\ncountry, exchanging the brilliant life in Washington for the hardships\r\nof Kansas—\"bleeding Kansas,\" torn with dissensions among its \"squatter\r\nsovereigns,\" and with a climate of stern severity, where food froze\r\nat night and must be broken with a hatchet for breakfast. Mrs. Walker\r\nshrank from the ordeal, for she was well fitted for gay society; but the\r\nPresident himself visited her and begged the sacrifice for the good of\r\nthe country. She went, and bore her trials. They were only a little in\r\nadvance of sterner trials ordained for some of her Washington friends.\r\nNor must we fail to acknowledge the social influence of Mrs. Jefferson\r\nDavis, one of the most brilliant women of her time—greatly sought by\r\ncultivated men and women.\r\n\r\nBut the wittiest and brightest of them all was Mrs. Clay, the wife of\r\nthe Senator from Alabama. She was extremely clever, the soul of every\r\ncompany. A costume ball at which she personated Mrs. Partington is\r\nstill remembered in Washington. Mrs. Partington's sayings could not be\r\narranged beforehand and conned for the occasion. Her malapropos replies\r\nmust be improvised on the moment, and must moreover be seasoned with wit\r\nto redeem them from commonplace dulness. Mrs. Clay rose to the occasion,\r\nand her Mrs. Partington became the Mrs. Partington of the future.\r\n\r\nThe reader will not fail to observe the number of Southern women who\r\nwere prominent in Mr. Buchanan's court. A correspondent of a leading\r\nNew York paper[4] has recently written an interesting article on this\r\nsubject. He declares that the Southern women (before Lincoln's day)\r\nhad long controlled the society of Washington. \"With their natural\r\nand acquired graces, with their inherited taste and ability in social\r\naffairs, it was natural that the reins should fall to them. They\r\nrepresented a clique of aristocracy; they were recognized leaders\r\nwho could afford to smile good-naturedly at the awkward and perplexed\r\nattempts of the women from the other sections—Mrs. Senator This, Mrs.\r\nCongressman That—to thread the ins and outs of Washington's social\r\nlabyrinth. To none of these ladies was the thought pleasant of secession\r\nfrom the Union and consequent giving up whatever of social dominion she\r\nhad acquired.\"\r\n\r\nI wish I could give some idea of the \"days at home\" of these court\r\nladies in Washington in 1858. The large public functions were all alike\r\nthen as now, with this exception, that nearly every man present was\r\nSomebody, and every woman Somebody's wife. It was not necessary for\r\nthese people to talk. The men made little effort. It was well known\r\nwhat they had said yesterday in the House or the Senate Chamber; but we\r\ndared not express opinions in public (and not freely in private), such\r\nwas the tense feeling at that time. Conversation had been always, at\r\nthe South, an art carefully cultivated. Conversation suffered at a time\r\nwhen we were forced to ignore subjects that possessed us with absorbing\r\ninterest and to confine ourselves to trivialities.\r\n\r\nExcusing the silence of one famous man, somebody remarked: \"Oh, well,\r\nyou know brilliant men do not of necessity talk well. Thrilled by\r\ntheir utterances in their speeches and writings, we are surprised, when\r\nwe meet them, at their silence.\" A \"famous man's\" eye twinkled. \"Ask\r\nGalt,\" he said, \"why he doesn't give away his gems. Probably he might\r\nanswer that he proposes to sell them,\" an ingenious way of avoiding the\r\nremotest hint that silence was the result of preoccupied thought on the\r\ngrave questions of the hour.\r\n\r\nFor some inexplicable reason the wives of great men are apt to be\r\nquiet and non-committal—little moons revolving around a great luminary.\r\nMoon-like, one side only is turned to the world. How is it on the other\r\nside? We have a glimpse of it over the _demi-tasse_ in the drawing-room\r\nafter dinner, or at our informal \"at homes\" in our own houses.\r\n\r\nAt these times of unbending in Washington we were wont to begin in a\r\nrather stilted manner, sipping our coffee and liqueurs in a leisurely\r\nway, and steering widely clear of politics and politicians. We talked of\r\nart and artists, galleries in Europe, shops in Paris,—anything except\r\nwhat we were all thinking about. The art of conversation suffered\r\nunder such circumstances. But some interesting books were just out\r\nin England, and everybody was discussing them. Thackeray had recently\r\ngiven \"The Virginians\" to the world. Tennyson was turning all the girls'\r\nheads with \"Elaine.\" A new star was rising—George Eliot. Dickens, we\r\nwere, at the moment, cordially hating because of his \"American Notes.\"\r\nBulwer was well to the fore. Two valued members of our own special\r\ncoterie were Randolph Rogers and Thomas Crawford the sculptor, whose\r\ngenius, differently expressed, lives to-day in his gifted son, Marion\r\nCrawford. Thomas Crawford had been commissioned by the state of Virginia\r\nto execute a colossal statue of Washington for the Capitol Square in\r\nRichmond, a great work,—including statues of Virginia's statesmen,—which\r\nwas happily completed in 1861, and from which I heard Jefferson Davis's\r\ninaugural address, February 22, 1862, upon his taking the oath as\r\npermanent President of the Confederacy. It was a black day of rain and\r\nsnow; the new government, destined never to flourish in sunshine, was\r\nborn in storm and tempest.\r\n\r\nThomas Crawford, born in New York in 1814, was now at the height of\r\nhis fame. He had studied and worked with Thorwaldsen. Apart from his\r\npeculiar genius he was a charming companion, full of versatile talk. The\r\nyounger man, Randolph Rogers, was also most interesting. He brought to\r\nus his sketches and drawings for the bronze doors of the Capitol before\r\nthey were submitted to the committee, and came again when they were\r\naccepted, to tell us of his good fortune.\r\n\r\nThe army and navy people were especially interesting. They never\r\ndiscussed politics. Their positions were assured and there were\r\nconsequently no feverish society strugglers among them. They had no\r\nvulgar respect for wealth, entertaining charmingly within their means.\r\nAdmiral Porter and his family were there, General Winfield Scott was\r\nthere, the admiral (then commander) forty-four years old, and the\r\nnoble old veteran nearer seventy-four. Both were delightful members of\r\nWashington society. Nobody esteemed wealth or spoke of it or thought of\r\nit. Office, position, talent, beauty, and charm were the requisites for\r\nmen and women.\r\n\r\nOn one day, I remember, I had gone the rounds of Cabinet receptions,\r\nhad taken my chocolate from the generous urn of the Secretary of State,\r\nand had dutifully looked in upon all the other Secretaries. I knew a\r\ndear little lady, foreign, attached to one of the legations (I really\r\nnever knew whether she was Russian or Hungarian), who had invited me\r\nfor the \"end of the afternoon.\" Her husband had not a prominent place in\r\nthe embassy, nor she in society, but she knew how to gather around her\r\ntea-kettle a choice little company, every one of whom felt honored to be\r\nincluded. I found her seated at a small round table, and she welcomed\r\nme in the English that gained from a musical voice, and the deliberate\r\nenunciation of syllable which always seems to me so complimentary and\r\nrespectful in foreigners.\r\n\r\nThe fashion of the low tea-table had just been introduced. One could\r\nhave tea, nothing else. One could always find behind the silver\r\nurns \"'igh and 'aughty\" butlers serving chocolate, wine, and every\r\nconceivable dainty at the houses of the great Senators, Ministers,\r\nand Cabinet officers. Things were much more _distingué_ at this lady's\r\ntea-table. A few early spring flowers, crocuses, hyacinths, or purple\r\nheather, were blooming here and there about the room. Our hostess was\r\ngowned in some white stuff, and there was a bit of classic suggestion in\r\nher attire, in the jewelled girdle, and an order or medal tucked under a\r\nribbon. A little white-capped maid welcomed and ushered us, and managed\r\nto hover about for all the service we were likely to require. The\r\nimpression grew upon me that all this had been done for me especially,\r\nand I found myself thinking how fortunate it was I had happened to come.\r\nThat lovely woman would have been so sorely disappointed had I stayed\r\naway!\r\n\r\nBut presently other guests arrived. They were all foreigners, but\r\nperceiving the American presence they spoke only English. The hostess\r\nput into motion the most musical conversation. How has she done it?\r\nShe has made no effort \"to entertain.\" Conversation had come unbidden.\r\nRussian tea? Why, certainly! Do we ever care for other than Russian\r\ntea? She was deliberate. We forgot we were sorely pressed this day with\r\nseventeen names on our list. We gave ourselves up to the pleasure of\r\nobserving her.\r\n\r\nShe lighted her silver lamp; and, although she wished us to see the\r\ngreat shining samovar which descended to her from her grandmother, she\r\nsaid it was good, very good indeed, in the camp or on journeys when one\r\nhad only charcoal; but here in America the fairy lamp to light the wax\r\ntaper and the alcohol burner beneath the kettle are best. She poured\r\nthe water, which had bubbled, but not boiled (boiling water would make\r\nthe tea flat), over delicious tea, paused a moment only, then poured\r\nthe steaming amber upon two lumps of sugar, two slices of lemon, and\r\none teaspoonful of rum, and we pronounced it a perfect cup of tea. But\r\nour enchantress said No, that some day ladies will grow tea in their\r\nown conservatories, and then only will it be perfect in this country;\r\nfor the ocean voyage spoils the delicacy of the sensitive herb.\r\n\r\nGlancing around the table, our hostess grasped the situation. Here was\r\na Russian lady with a proud head, there two dark-eyed Bohemians, one\r\nGreek beauty, an English woman, and our own stiff, heavy, uncompromising\r\nAmerican self!\r\n\r\nShe is to make these people happy for the five minutes they are around\r\nher little board. How does it come to pass that these strangers find a\r\ncommon ground upon which they can hold animated conversation?\r\n\r\nThey talked of genius and geniuses,—how they are not created by\r\nopportunity or culture, but are inspired; how that, apart from their\r\ngifts, they are quite like other people, not even cleverer always.\r\n\"Yes,\" said the Greek girl, with an exalted look in her dark eyes, \"they\r\nare chosen, like the prophets, to speak great words or compose immortal\r\nmusic, or build symphonies in stone; and what they do is outside\r\nthemselves altogether.\" \"It is literally true,\" said the Englishwoman,\r\n\"that people have 'a gift' apart from their ordinary selves. Does not\r\nGeorge Eliot say that his novels grow in him like a plant. No amount\r\nof work and study can create a genius!\" And then everybody marvels at\r\nthe wonderful young man (for nobody knows it is a woman) who has just\r\nwritten \"Adam Bede\" and \"The Mill on the Floss.\"\r\n\r\nOr perhaps the hostess has bribed some one of the foreign legation\r\nto come to her \"at home.\" Novels on Washington life hint of such a\r\npossibility. Or perhaps some prince of good talkers among our own\r\nMinisters is home for a brief holiday, or returned from a mission, and\r\na circle gathers around him.\r\n\r\nOur Minister, sent to France by Mr. Pierce, once honored me by his\r\npresence and told us the following story. Everybody who remembers the\r\ngenial John Y. Mason will easily imagine how he told it, and how his\r\nown magnetism possessed his listeners. Not a tea-cup rattled during the\r\nnarration. \"I lived,\" said Mr. Mason, \"at a hotel for a few weeks after\r\nreceiving my appointment as Minister Plenipotentiary—while my house\r\nwas being made ready to bring my family. The house was crowded, and my\r\nlandlord was forced to divide one of his offices by a thin partition to\r\nreceive me at all.\r\n\r\n\"One night I was awakened by a stifled sob on the other side of the\r\npartition. Rising on my elbow, I listened. The sob was repeated—then I\r\nheard abusive language and oaths in English—I fancied I heard a blow!\r\nLeaping to my feet, I struck smartly on the partition, and all was\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n\"The next morning I asked the clerk about my neighbors and complained\r\nthat they disturbed me. He shrugged his shoulders and said, 'Mais,\r\nMonsieur! they are Americans!' as if that explained everything. However,\r\nhe informed me that they had left the hotel that morning.\r\n\r\n\"A few days later I was sitting in my room at the legation, when I\r\nreceived a visitor—a slender female closely veiled, who said in a\r\ntroubled whisper that she had come to claim protection of the French\r\ngovernment. I told her I could not confer with her while she was\r\ndisguised, and she slowly raised her hand and held her veil aside. I\r\nnever saw a lovelier face.\r\n\r\n\"She could not have been older than eighteen years. Her features were\r\ndelicate, her eyes large and expressive, her brow shaded by golden-brown\r\nhair. She was deathly white. I never saw such pallor. 'What can I do\r\nfor you, my child?' I asked. Well, it was a sad story. Married to a\r\ndissipated young fellow, away on her wedding journey; threatened, and\r\nin terror of losing her life. She wished the protection of the police.\r\nShe said she should never have had the courage to ask it alone, but that\r\nshe knew I had slept near her at the Maison Dorée. I had heard! I could\r\nunderstand. I was the American Minister, and I could help.\r\n\r\n\"'But think,' I said, 'I heard nothing but harsh language. We cannot\r\ngo with this to the _préfet_. He will not consider it cause for action\r\nagainst your husband.'\r\n\r\n\"The girl hesitated. Finally, with a burst of tears, she unfastened\r\nher gown at the throat, turned it down, and disclosed the dark print of\r\nfingers on the delicate skin.\r\n\r\n\"It was enough. She had been choked into silence—this frail American\r\ngirl—on the night when I heard the smothered sob.\r\n\r\n\"Of course you may imagine my zeal in her behalf. I had daughters of my\r\nown. I arranged to accompany the young wife at once to the office of the\r\n_préfet_, and having ascertained the address of her bankers I resolved\r\nto make arrangements to get her out of Paris in case she felt her life\r\nto be in danger.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I waited long at the office of the _préfet_. Finally our turn\r\ncame. I rose and made my statement. Imagine my feelings when my fair\r\nclient threw back her veil, and with a surprised look said:\r\n\r\n\"'I think the American Minister has been dreaming!'\r\n\r\n\"I felt as if a tub of ice-water had been poured over me. Of course\r\nmy position was perfectly ridiculous. Before I could recover she had\r\nslipped through the crowd and was gone. While we waited she had changed\r\nher mind!\"\r\n\r\n\"The wretch!\" exclaimed one of the listeners. \"That just proves that\r\nwomen are always attracted by brutality.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really?\" said Mr. Mason.\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly, perhaps, but there was once an English countess who\r\nexplained a divorce suit of one of her relatives thus:—\r\n\r\n\"'You see, Ermentrude was one of those women who needed kicking down\r\nthe stairs, and Ferdinand was gentle; he was not up to it!'\"\r\n\r\nAn agreeable function, no longer in vogue in this country, was the\r\nevening party. Lady Napier gave one of these parties to present her\r\nfriends to Edward Everett.\r\n\r\nThese parties were arranged that pleasant people might meet\r\ndistinguished strangers and each other. As this was the prime object\r\nof these occasions, there were no blatant bands to make conversation\r\nimpossible, but there was no lack of delightful music. Miss Nerissa\r\nSaunders played exquisitely upon the harp; Mrs. Gales's niece, Juliana\r\nMay, sang divinely; many young ladies had cultivated voices. Nobody\r\nthought of hiring entertainment for guests. The guests were bright\r\ntalkers and could entertain each other. If a ball room were attached\r\nto the _salon_, dancing was expected; but the parlors were distant\r\nand people could talk! Of course it is always stupid to collect a\r\nlot of dull people together, but the wives of the brilliant men of\r\nMr. Buchanan's administration understood entertaining. There were\r\nalways gifted conversationalists present who liked talking better than\r\neating, with cleverness enough to draw out, and not forestall, the wit\r\nof others. This art could not be claimed by the great talkers of old\r\nEnglish society, Johnson, Macaulay, Coleridge, De Quincey, and the rest.\r\nWe should not now, I am sure, care much for these monopolists. Sheridan,\r\nfor instance, must have been rather a quenching element at an evening\r\nparty; for in addition to his own witty creations, he had a trick of\r\npreserving the bon mots of others, leading conversation into channels\r\nwhere they would fit in, and using them accordingly. Thus in talking\r\nwith Sheridan his friends had a dozen wits to cope with withal.\r\n\r\nOur Washington hostesses always gave a supper—not a fine supper—a _good_\r\nsupper, where the old family receipt book had been consulted, especially\r\nif our hostess had come from Kentucky, Maryland, or Virginia. The\r\ncanvasback ducks, terrapin, and oysters were unlike Gautier's. We all\r\nknow that rubies are now less rare in this country than good cooks. We\r\nmay essay the triumphs of the old Washington of the fifties, but beneath\r\nour own fig tree they become failures and shabby makeshifts. There are\r\nmysteries in cooking unattainable to any but the elect—and of the elect\r\nwere the sable priestesses of the Washington kitchens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE THIRTY-SIXTH CONGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the famous Thirty-sixth Congress met for its long session, December\r\n5, 1859, the whole country was in ferment over the execution of John\r\nBrown. \"An indiscreet move in any direction,\" wrote ex-President Tyler\r\nfrom his plantation, \"may produce results deeply to be deplored. I\r\nfear the debates in Congress, and above all the Speaker's election. If\r\nexcitement prevails in Congress, it will add fuel to the flame which\r\nalready burns so terrifically.\"[5] He, and all patriots, might well\r\nhave been afraid of increased excitement. It was evident from the first\r\nhour that the atmosphere was heavily charged. The House resolved itself\r\ninto a great debating society, in which the only questions were: \"Is\r\nslavery right or wrong? Shall it, or shall it not, be allowed in the\r\nterritories?\" The foray of the zealot and fanatic aggravated the fury\r\nof the combatants.\r\n\r\nThe member from Mississippi—L. Q. C. Lamar (afterwards Supreme Court\r\nJustice of the United States)—threw an early firebrand by announcing\r\non the floor of the House, \"The Republicans are not guiltless of the\r\nblood of John Brown, his co-conspirators, and the innocent victims of\r\nhis ruthless vengeance.\" Lawrence Keitt of South Carolina declared: \"The\r\nSouth asks nothing but its rights. I would have no more, but as God is\r\nmy judge, I would shatter this republic from turret to foundation-stone\r\nbefore I would take a tittle less.\" Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania\r\nretorted: \"I do not blame gentlemen of the South for using this threat\r\nof rending God's creation from foundation to turret. They have tried it\r\nfifty times, and fifty times they have found weak and recreant tremblers\r\nin the North who have been affected by it, and who have acted from\r\nthose intimidations.\" Such were a few, by comparison with those that\r\nrapidly followed, of the wild utterances of the hour. This occurred on\r\nthe second day of the session. The House was in an uproar! Members from\r\ntheir seats crowded down into the aisles, and the clerk was powerless to\r\npreserve order. \"A few more such scenes,\" said one, \"and we shall hear\r\nthe crack of the revolver and see the gleam of brandished blade.\"\r\n\r\nIn this spirit Congress proceeded to ballot for its Speaker, and\r\nballoted for two months (until February 1), before Mr. Sherman was\r\nabandoned (having withdrawn his name) and a compromise effected by the\r\nelection of Mr. Pennington, who represented neither extreme of party.\r\n\r\nDuring these two months everything was said that could be said to fan\r\nthe flame. Hot disputes were accentuated by bitter personal remarks.\r\nOne day a pistol accidentally fell from the pocket of a member from\r\nNew York, and, thinking it had been drawn with the intention of using\r\nit, some of the members were wild with passion, crying excitedly\r\nfor the sergeant-at-arms, and turning the House into a pandemonium.\r\nJohn Sherman, who had been the unlucky bone of contention, made this\r\nremarkable statement: \"When I came here I did not believe that the\r\nslavery question would come up; and but for the unfortunate affair of\r\nBrown at Harper's Ferry I do not believe that there would have been any\r\nfeeling on the subject. Northern men came here with kindly feelings, no\r\nman approving the foray of John Brown, and every man willing to say so,\r\nevery man willing to admit it as an act of lawless violence.\"\r\n\r\nFour years before this stormy election, Banks had been chosen Speaker\r\nafter a contest longer by a few days than this. Then, as now, slavery\r\nwas the point at issue; but \"good humor and courtesy had marked the\r\nprevious contest where now were acrimony and defiance.... Then threats\r\nof disunion were received with laughter; now they were too manifestly\r\nsincere to be treated lightly.\" In four years the breach between North\r\nand South, once only a rift in the rock, had become a yawning chasm.\r\nWhat might it not become in four years more?\r\n\r\nNot foreseeing the rapid change of public sentiment, the Democrats had,\r\nfour years before, selected Charleston for the meeting of the convention\r\nto name their candidate for the presidency. Accordingly, on April 23,\r\nthe party was convened in the \"hotbed of disunion.\"\r\n\r\nThe Northern Democrats had heard much of the splendor and elegance\r\nin which Charlestonians lived, and of the Arabian hospitality of the\r\nSouth, which could ignore all animosities over the bread and salt. But\r\nCharleston turned a cold shoulder to its guests from the North. All\r\nhearts, however, and all homes were opened to the Southerners. They\r\ndined with the aristocrats, drove with richly dressed ladies in gay\r\nequipages, and were entertained generally with lavish hospitality. All\r\nthis tended to widen the breach between the sections.\r\n\r\nWhen the delegates left their fair entertainers for the sessions of\r\nthe convention, the ladies repaired to old St. Michael's Episcopal\r\nChurch, where prayers, specially ordered for the success and prosperity\r\nof the South, were daily offered. \"At the same time fervent abolition\r\npreachers at the North were praying for a disruption of the Charleston\r\nconvention.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas had written a platform that was not acceptable to\r\nthe South. After its adoption seven delegates from Southern states\r\ndeclared their purpose of secession. The convention, seeing that it was\r\nimpossible to reach any result, adjourned May 3, to meet at Baltimore\r\nthe 18th of June. The seceders resolved to meet at Richmond the second\r\nMonday of May. This initial movement awakened the alarm of at least\r\none devoted son of the South. Alexander Stephens wrote to a friend:\r\n\"The leaders intended from the beginning to rule or ruin.... Envy,\r\nhate, jealousy, spite—these made war in heaven, which made devils of\r\nangels, and the same passions will make devils of men. The Secession\r\nmovement was instigated by nothing but bad passions. Patriotism, in my\r\nopinion, had no more to do with it than love of God had with the other\r\nrevolt.\"[6] In conversation with his friend Johnston, shortly after the\r\nadjournment of the Convention, Stephens said, \"Men will be cutting one\r\nanother's throats in a little while. In less than twelve months we shall\r\nbe in a war, and that the bloodiest in history. Men seem to be utterly\r\nblinded to the future.\"[7]\r\n\r\nThe nomination of Lincoln and Hamlin on a purely sectional platform\r\naroused such excitement all over the land, that the Senate and House\r\nof Representatives gave themselves entirely to speeches on the state of\r\nthe country. Read at this late day, many of them appear to be the high\r\nutterances of patriots, pleading with each other for forbearance. Others\r\nexhausted the vocabulary of coarse vituperation. \"Nigger thief,\" \"slave\r\ndriver,\" were not uncommon words. Others still, although less unrefined,\r\nwere not less abusive. Newspapers no longer reported a speech as calm,\r\nconvincing, logical, or eloquent,—these were tame expressions. The\r\nterms now in use were: \"a torrent of scathing denunciation,\" \"withering\r\nsarcasm,\" \"crushing invective,\" the orator's eyes, the while, \"blazing\r\nwith scorn and indignation.\" Young members ignored the salutation of\r\nold Senators. Mr. Seward's smile after such a rebuff was maddening! No\r\nopportunity for scornful allusion was lost. My husband was probably the\r\nfirst Congressman to wear \"the gray,\" a suit of domestic cloth having\r\nbeen presented to him by his constituents. Immediately a Northern member\r\nsaid, in an address on the state of the country, \"Virginia, instead of\r\nclothing herself in sheep's wool, had better don her appropriate garb\r\nof sackcloth and ashes.\" In pathetic contrast to these scenes were\r\nthe rosy, cherubic little pages, in white blouses and cambric collars,\r\nwho flitted to and fro, bearing, with smiling faces, dynamic notes and\r\nmessages from one Representative to another. They represented the future\r\nwhich these gentlemen were engaged in wrecking—for many of these boys\r\nwere sons of Southern widows, who even now, under the most genial skies,\r\nled lives of anxiety and struggle. Thoroughly alarmed, the women of\r\nWashington thronged the galleries of the House and the Senate Chamber.\r\nFrom morning until the hour of adjournment we would sit, spellbound, as\r\none after another drew the lurid picture of disunion and war.\r\n\r\nOur social lines were now strictly drawn between North and South.\r\nNames were dropped from visiting lists, occasions avoided on which we\r\nmight expect to meet members of the party antagonistic to our own. My\r\nfriend Mrs. Douglas espoused all her husband's quarrels and distinctly\r\n\"cut\" his opponents. There were very few boxes to be had at our little\r\ntheatre—and the three best were usually secured by Mrs. Douglas, Miss\r\nHarriet Lane, and Mrs. John R. Thompson. The feud between the President\r\nand Judge Douglas was bitter, and Mrs. Douglas never appeared at Miss\r\nLane's receptions in the winter of 1859-1860. One evening we were all\r\nin our theatre boxes, Miss Lane next to us, and I the guest of Mrs.\r\nDouglas. Mr. Porcher Miles, member from South Carolina, who had opposed\r\nJudge Douglas's nomination, appeared at the door of our box. Instantly\r\nMrs. Douglas turned and said, \"Sir, you have made a mistake. Your visit\r\nis intended for next door!\" \"Madam,\" said Mr. Miles, \"I presumed I\r\nmight be permitted to make my respects to Mrs. Pryor, for whom my call\r\nwas intended.\" I had the benefit, of course, of the private opinions\r\nof each, and was able to be the friend of each. \"This, I suppose,\r\nis Southern chivalry,\" said my fair friend. \"It savors, I think, of\r\nill-bred impertinence.\" \"I had supposed her a lady,\" said Mr. Miles, \"or\r\nat least a woman of the world. She behaved like a rustic—an _ingénue_.\"\r\n\r\nI could but receive their confidences in silence, perfectly well knowing\r\nthat both were in the wrong. Both were betrayed by the mad passions of\r\nthe hour—passions which caused older heads to misunderstand, mislead,\r\nand misbehave! \"I am the most unpopular man in the country,\" said Judge\r\nDouglas (one of the presidential candidates); \"I could walk from Boston\r\nto Chicago by the light of my own burning effigies,—and I guess you all\r\nknow how much Virginia loves me.\"\r\n\r\nI had the good fortune to retain some of my Northern friends. The\r\nfamily of the Secretary of State was loyal to me to the end. When\r\nmy husband was once embroiled in a violent quarrel, growing out of\r\nsectional feeling, General Cass sent his granddaughter, pretty Lizzie\r\nLedyard (my prime favorite), with his love to bid me \"take heart,\" that\r\n\"all would turn out right.\" Mrs. Douglas never abated one jot of her\r\ngentle kindness, although she knew we belonged to a party adverse to\r\nher husband. Mrs. Horace Clark's little brown ponies stopped as often\r\nas ever at my door to secure me for a drive down the avenue and a seat\r\nbeside her in the House. She had been a Miss Vanderbilt and was now wife\r\nof a member from New York. All of them were prompt to congratulate me\r\nupon my husband's speech on \"the state of the country,\" and to praise\r\nit with generous words as \"calm, free from vituperation, eloquent in\r\npleading for peace and forbearance.\"\r\n\r\nThe evening after this speech was delivered, we were sitting in the\r\nlibrary on the first floor of our home, when there was a ring at\r\nthe door-bell. The servants were in a distant part of the house, and\r\nsuch was our excited state that I ran to the door and answered the\r\nbell myself. It was snowing fast, a carriage stood at the door, and\r\nout of it bundled a mass of shawls and woollen scarfs. On entering,\r\na manservant commenced unwinding the bundle, which proved to be the\r\nSecretary of State, General Cass! We knew not what to think. He was\r\nseventy-seven years old. Every night at nine o'clock it was the custom\r\nof his daughter, Mrs. Canfield, to wrap him in flannels and put him\r\nto bed. What had brought him out at midnight? As soon as he entered,\r\nbefore sitting down, he exclaimed: \"Mr. Pryor, I have been hearing\r\nabout secession for a long time—and I would not listen. But now I am\r\nfrightened, sir, I am frightened! Your speech in the House to-day gives\r\nme some hope. Mr. Pryor! I crossed the Ohio when I was sixteen years\r\nold with but a pittance in my pocket, and this glorious Union has made\r\nme what I am. I have risen from my bed, sir, to implore you to do what\r\nyou can to avert the disasters which threaten our country with ruin.\"\r\n\r\nNever was a spring more delightful than that of 1860. The Marine Band\r\nplayed every Saturday in the President's grounds, and thither the\r\nwhole world repaired, to walk, or to sit in open carriages, and talk of\r\neverything except politics. Easy compliments to the ladies fell from\r\nthe lips of the men who could apply to each other in debate abuse too\r\npainful to remember. Sometimes we would be invited for the afternoon\r\nto sit on the veranda of the White House—and who could fail to mark the\r\nravages of anxiety and care upon the face of the President! All the more\r\nbecause he insistently repeated that he was never better—that he slept\r\nfinely and enjoyed the best health. Nevertheless, if one chanced to\r\nstand silently near him in a quiet corner, he might be heard to mutter,\r\n\"Not in my time—not in my time.\" Not in his time let this dear Union be\r\nsevered, this dear country be drowned in blood.\r\n\r\nOn other afternoons we visited Mr. and Mrs. Robert E. Lee at Arlington,\r\nor drove out to Georgetown through the fragrant avenue of blossoming\r\ncrab-apples, or to Mrs. Gales's delightful house for tea, returning\r\nin the soft moonlight. Everybody in Washington dined early. Congress\r\nusually adjourned at four o'clock, and my little boys were wont to be\r\non the roof of our house, to watch for the falling of the flag over the\r\nHouse of Representatives, the signal that we might soon have dinner. The\r\nevening meal was late, usually handed. It was considered not \"stylish\"\r\nto serve it at a table. A servant would enter the drawing-room about\r\neight o'clock, with a tray holding plates and little doilies. Another\r\nwould bring in buttered biscuits and chipped beef or ham, and a third\r\ntray held cups of tea and coffee. Some delicate sweet would follow.\r\nLittle tables of Chinese lacquer were placed between two or more\r\nladies, and lucky was the man who would be invited to share one of\r\nthem. Otherwise he must improvise a rest for his plate on his trembling\r\nknees. \"Take care! Your plate will fall,\" I said to one. \"Fall! I wish\r\nit would—and _break_! The only thing that worries me is when the blamed\r\nthing takes to rolling. Why, I have chased plates all around the room\r\nuntil I thought they were bewitched or held the secret of perpetual\r\nmotion!\" These suppers were very conversational, and one did not mind\r\ntheir being so light. There would be punch and sandwiches at eleven.\r\n\r\nSuch were the pleasant happenings that filled our days—clouded now by\r\nthe perils which we could not ignore after the warnings to which we\r\nlistened at the Capitol. We were conscious of this always in our round\r\nof visits, receptions, dinners, and balls, with the light persiflage\r\nand compliments still in our ears.\r\n\r\nBut when late evening came, the golden hour of reunion in the library\r\non the first floor of our home was marked by graver talk. There would\r\nassemble R. M. T. Hunter, Muscoe Garnett, Porcher Miles, L. Q. C. Lamar,\r\nBoyce, Barksdale of Mississippi, Keitt of South Carolina, with perhaps\r\nsome visitors from the South. Then Susan would light her fires and show\r\nus the kind of oysters that could please her \"own white folks,\" and\r\nJames would bring in lemons and hot water with some choice brand of old\r\nKentucky.\r\n\r\nThese were not convivial gatherings. These men held troubled\r\nconsultations on the state of the country—the real meaning and intent\r\nof the North, the half-trusted scheme of Judge Douglas to allow the\r\nterritories to settle for themselves the vexed question of slavery\r\nwithin their borders, the right of peaceable secession. The dawn would\r\nfind them again and again with but one conclusion—they would stand\r\ntogether: \"Unum et commune periclum una salus!\"\r\n\r\nBut Holbein's spectre was already behind the door, and had marked his\r\nmen! In a few months the swift bullet for one enthusiast, for another\r\n(the least considered of them all), a glorious death on the walls of\r\na hard-won rampart—he the first to raise his colors and the shout of\r\nvictory; for only one, or two, or three, the doubtful boon of existence\r\nafter the struggle was all over; for _all_ survivors, memories that made\r\nthe next four years seem to be the sum of life—the only real life—beside\r\nwhich the coming years would be but a troubled dream.\r\n\r\nThe long session did not close until June, and in the preceding month\r\nAbraham Lincoln was chosen candidate by the Republican party for the\r\npresidency, and Stephen A. Douglas by the Democrats. The South had\r\nalso a candidate, and hoping to make things better, the ruffled-shirt\r\ngentry—the Old-Line Whigs—had also named their man.\r\n\r\nMy little boys and I were glad to go home to Virginia. A season of\r\nperfect happiness awaited them, with their sisters and the dear old\r\npeople whom they called grandfather and grandmother. Under the shade\r\nof the trees, and in the veranda covered with Lamarque roses, who could\r\ndream of war?\r\n\r\nIn the hot and bitter campaign that ensued we are told that \"Douglas\r\ntook the _unusual course_ for a presidential candidate of visiting\r\ndifferent parts of the country and discussing the political issues and\r\ntheir personal bearings. Speaking on all occasions, from the platform of\r\nthe railroad car, the balcony of the hotel, at monster mass-meetings,\r\nhe said much that was trivial and undignified, but he also said much\r\nthat was patriotic, unselfish, and pregnant with constitutional wisdom.\r\nColdly received at the South, where he was looked upon as a renegade,\r\nhe aroused great enthusiasm at the North, and his personal presence\r\nwas the only feature that gave any life to the struggle against the\r\nRepublicans.\"[8]\r\n\r\nThe words \"irrepressible conflict\" were much in evidence during this\r\ncampaign. Seward adopted them, and made speeches characterized as\r\nhis \"Irrepressible Conflict Speeches.\"[9] Seward reaffirmed almost\r\neverywhere the declaration of the \"irrepressible conflict,\" and when\r\nchallenged because of the term, he \"maintained that the Republicans\r\nsimply reverted to the theory and practice of their fathers,\" giving no\r\nhint of a quotation.\r\n\r\nThe authorship of these words has always been credited to Mr. Seward.\r\nTheir true origin may be found in the address of Mr. Lincoln, delivered\r\nat Cincinnati, Ohio, in September, 1859. On page 262 of the volume\r\npublished by Follett, Foster, & Co. in 1860, entitled \"Political Debates\r\nbetween Hon. Abraham Lincoln and Hon. Stephen A. Douglas,\" may be found\r\nthe following extract from Mr. Lincoln's speech:—\r\n\r\n     \"I have alluded in the beginning of these remarks to the fact\r\n     that Judge Douglas has made great complaint of my having\r\n     expressed the opinion that this Government 'cannot endure\r\n     permanently half slave and half free.' He has complained of\r\n     Seward for using different language, and declaring that there\r\n     is an 'irrepressible conflict' between the principles of free\r\n     and slave labor. [A voice: 'He says it is not original with\r\n     Seward. That is original with Lincoln.'] I will attend to that\r\n     immediately, sir. Since that time, Hickman of Pennsylvania\r\n     expressed the same sentiment. He has never denounced Mr.\r\n     Hickman; why? There is a little chance, notwithstanding that\r\n     opinion in the mouth of Hickman, that he may yet be a Douglas\r\n     man. That is the difference! It is not unpatriotic to hold\r\n     that opinion, if a man is a Douglas man.\r\n\r\n     \"But neither I, nor Seward, nor Hickman is entitled to the\r\n     enviable or unenviable distinction of having first expressed\r\n     that idea. That same idea was expressed by the _Richmond\r\n     Enquirer_ in Virginia, in 1856, quite two years before it was\r\n     expressed by the first of us. And while Douglas was pluming\r\n     himself that in his conflict with my humble self, last year,\r\n     he had 'squelched out' that fatal heresy, as he delighted to\r\n     call it, and had suggested that if he only had had a chance\r\n     to be in New York and meet Seward he would have 'squelched' it\r\n     there also, it never occurred to him to breathe a word against\r\n     Pryor. I don't think that you can discover that Douglas ever\r\n     talked of going to Virginia to 'squelch' out that idea there.\r\n     No. More than that. That same Roger A. Pryor was brought to\r\n     Washington City and made the editor of the _par excellence_\r\n     Douglas paper, after making use of that expression, which in\r\n     us is so unpatriotic and heretical.\"\r\n\r\nBefore we returned to Washington Mr. Lincoln was elected President of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nMEMORABLE DAYS IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nA momentous day in the history of this country was November 6, 1860—on\r\nthat day the extreme party of the North elected its candidate, with a\r\nVice-President, making the Executive purely sectional. But few people\r\nexpected the fulfilment of the evils so insistently threatened as a\r\nconsequence of this election.\r\n\r\nNot for one moment had we seriously entertained the thought of\r\nsecession. The question of slavery in the territories was still\r\nunsettled, and the stormy scenes in the House might possibly be\r\nreënacted. Like General Cass, we had heard all our lives rumors of\r\npossible secession, possible war. Nobody believed these rumors—any\r\nmore than we believed that every threatening cloud would burst in a\r\ndevastating tempest. It was part of the routine, \"the order of the day,\"\r\nto enliven things by warm discussions and spicy personalities.\r\n\r\nMy husband had been unanimously reëlected, and our delightful Washington\r\nlife was assured to us—certainly for three winters—probably for all\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWe were so deeply concerned about the state of the country at large,\r\nthat his election excited us but little. When the polls closed at\r\nsunset, one of his political friends came to me and said there would\r\nbe a torch-light procession in his honor, that the crowd would call\r\nat his residence, and the house must be illuminated. \"Illuminated!\" I\r\nexclaimed. \"Impossible! There are not half a dozen candles in the house,\r\nand the stores are all closed. Besides, the babies will be asleep. It\r\nis bad for babies to be roused from their first sleep.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend seemed to appreciate this reasoning; but later in the evening\r\nI received a bushel of small white turnips and a box of candles, with\r\na pencilled note saying that I must cut holes in the vegetables, and\r\nI would find them admirable candlesticks. The little boys and servants\r\nwent to work with a will, and when the drum announced the near approach\r\nof the procession, every window was blazing with a double row of lights,\r\none row on the window-sill, the other midway, on the top of the lower\r\nsash.\r\n\r\nMy young Congressman was considered a brilliant speaker, and his talents\r\nwere sometimes called into use in Washington. Some matter of municipal\r\ninterest was supported by him, and another torch-light procession\r\ngathered late one night around the door of the house on New York Avenue.\r\n\r\n\"You are not to listen,\" he said to me, as he descended to the front\r\ndoor to speak to the crowd; \"I shall say a few words only.\" I threw a\r\nshawl over my night-dress and crouched down in a little balcony just\r\nover his head. To my prejudiced mind, his speech was the most graceful\r\nand charming thing I had ever heard. I was in a delightful trance of\r\nhappiness when he closed, and was rudely awakened when, in response to\r\nshouts of \"Go on, go on, we could listen all night,\" the daring young\r\norator deliberately turned and pointed to the balcony above him: \"Go on,\r\nmy friends? Go on, exposed to the criticism of one from whose criticism\r\nI am always trying to escape?\"\r\n\r\nI fell back out of sight on the floor. I never listened afterward!\r\n\r\nAnd among the pleasant happenings of these golden days, so soon to\r\nbe shut in by darkness and sorrow, was the presentation to my young\r\nCongressman of a beautiful service of silver from his Democratic friends\r\nof Virginia in recognition of \"brilliant talents, eminent worth, and\r\ndistinguished services.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Galt made this splendid service, and I record it here because\r\nit became part of the history of the next years of trouble. I should\r\nhave lost it once (in a dark hour), but Mr. Galt bade me keep it—that\r\nbrighter days were in store for me and mine, a prophecy which he lived\r\nto see fulfilled.\r\n\r\nWe were all in our places in November, setting our houses in order,\r\nseveral weeks before the assembling of Congress. We were warmly welcomed\r\ninto our pleasant home by Susan, whose authority, now fully established\r\nand recognized, kept us in perfect order. Everything promised a season\r\nof unusual interest. We now knew everybody—and what is more I, for one,\r\nliked everybody. It takes so little to make a woman happy!\r\n\r\nIn Washington our social life did not begin before New Year's Day. Among\r\nour first cards this winter was an invitation to the marriage of Mr.\r\nBouligny, member from Louisiana, and Miss Parker, daughter of a wealthy\r\nWashington grocer. Rumors reached us of unusual plans for this wedding.\r\nMr. Parker's large house was to be converted into a conservatory filled\r\nwith blossoming roses and lilies. Fountains were to be introduced, new\r\neffects in lighting. The presents were to be magnificent, the bridal\r\ndress gorgeous.\r\n\r\nUpon arriving at the house (I think it was an afternoon wedding) I found\r\nthe President seated in an arm-chair at one end of the drawing-room, and\r\nthe guests ranging themselves on either side. A crimson velvet curtain\r\nwas stretched across the other end of the room. Presently the curtain\r\nparted, and the bridal tableau appeared in position behind it. After the\r\nceremony the crowd waited until the President went forward to wish the\r\nbride and her husband \"a great deal of happiness.\" Everybody remained\r\nstanding until Mr. Buchanan returned to his seat. I stood behind his\r\nchair and observed that he had aged much since the summer.\r\n\r\nHe had had much to bear. Unable to please either party, he had been\r\naccused of cowardice, imbecility, and even insanity, by both parties.\r\n\"The President is pale with fear,\" said General Cass. \"He divides his\r\ntime equally between praying and crying. Such an imbecile was never\r\nseen before,\" said another. A double-leaded editorial in the _New York\r\nTribune_ of December 17 suggested that he might be insane. On the day\r\nof the wedding, December 20, he stoutly denied that he was ill. \"I never\r\nenjoyed better health nor a more tranquil spirit,\" said the hard-pressed\r\nPresident. \"I have not lost an hour's sleep nor a single meal. I weigh\r\nwell and prayerfully what course I ought to adopt,\" he had written on\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\nThe crowd in the Parker drawing-room soon thinned as the guests found\r\ntheir way to the rooms in which the presents were displayed. The\r\nPresident kept his seat, and I stood behind him as one and another came\r\nforward to greet him. Presently he looked over his shoulder and said,\r\n\"Madam, do you suppose the house is on fire? I hear an unusual commotion\r\nin the hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will inquire the cause, Mr. President,\" I said. I went out at the\r\nnearest door, and there in the entrance hall I found Mr. Lawrence Keitt,\r\nmember from South Carolina, leaping in the air, shaking a paper over his\r\nhead, and exclaiming, \"Thank God! Oh, thank God!\" I took hold of him and\r\nsaid: \"Mr. Keitt, are you crazy? The President hears you, and wants to\r\nknow what's the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" he cried, \"South Carolina has seceded! Here's the telegram. I feel\r\nlike a boy let out from school.\"\r\n\r\nI returned and, bending over Mr. Buchanan's chair, said in a low voice:\r\n\"It appears, Mr. President, that South Carolina has seceded from the\r\nUnion. Mr. Keitt has a telegram.\" He looked at me, stunned for a moment.\r\nFalling back and grasping the arms of his chair, he whispered, \"Madam,\r\nmight I beg you to have my carriage called?\" I met his secretary and\r\nsent him in without explanation, and myself saw that his carriage was\r\nat the door before I reëntered the room. I then found my husband, who\r\nwas already cornered with Mr. Keitt, and we called our own carriage\r\nand drove to Judge Douglas's. There was no more thought of bride,\r\nbridegroom, wedding cake, or wedding breakfast.\r\n\r\nThis was the tremendous event which was to change all our lives—to\r\ngive us poverty for riches, mutilation and wounds for strength and\r\nhealth, obscurity and degradation for honor and distinction, exile and\r\nloneliness for inherited homes and friends, pain and death for happiness\r\nand life.\r\n\r\nThe news was not known, except in official circles, until the evening.\r\nThe night was dark. A drizzling rain was falling; the streets were\r\nalmost impassable from mud.\r\n\r\nAt the house of a prominent South Carolina gentleman a crowd soon\r\ncollected. The street was full of carriages, the house brilliantly\r\nlighted.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Porter, then a lieutenant, had heard the startling news,\r\nand called at this house to tell it. He found the mistress of the\r\nmansion descending in cloak and bonnet, and as soon as she saw him she\r\nexclaimed: \"Oh, Captain, you are just the man I want. I'm going to the\r\nWhite House to tell the President some good news. The horses are sick\r\nand I'm going to walk over.\"[10]\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible for you to walk through the rain and mud,\" said the\r\nLieutenant. \"There are ten or twelve hacks at the door, and I will press\r\none into your service.\" So saying, he called a carriage and helped her\r\nto enter it, getting in after her.\r\n\r\n\"I was under the impression,\" he said, as they started, \"that you were\r\nhaving a party at your house, it was so brilliantly lighted up, and I\r\nthought I would venture in uninvited.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed,\" she replied; \"but we have received glorious news from\r\nthe South, and my husband's friends are calling to congratulate him.\r\nSouth Carolina has seceded, and, oh, Captain, we will have a glorious\r\nmonarchy, and you must join us.\"\r\n\r\n\"And be made Duke of Benedict Arnold?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" she exclaimed, \"we will make you an admiral.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Lieutenant Porter, \"Admiral of the Blue. For I should\r\nfeel blue enough to see everything turned upside down, and our boasted\r\nliberty and civilization whistled down the wind.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you have?\" she inquired. \"Would you have us tamely submit\r\nto all the indignities the North puts upon us, and place our necks under\r\ntheir feet? Why, this very day my blood boiled while I was in Congress,\r\nand I could scarcely contain myself. An old black Republican was\r\nberating the Southern people as if they were a pack of naughty children.\r\nHowever, Mr. Rhett took the floor and gave the man such a castigation\r\nthat he slunk away and was no more heard from.\"\r\n\r\nJust then they reached the White House. \"Come in,\" said the lady, \"and\r\nhear me tell the President the good news.\"\r\n\r\nLieutenant Porter preferred returning to her house. There he found\r\na crowd around a generous bowl of punch. When he had an opportunity,\r\nhe asked the host if he thought it possible the Southern states would\r\nsecede. \"What more do they want?\" he inquired. \"They have a majority\r\nin the Senate and the House, and, with the Supreme Court on their side,\r\nthey could make laws to suit themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" his host replied, \"most people would be satisfied with that.\r\n'Better to bear the ills we have than fly to others that we know not\r\nof.' But _you_ will join us? _You must!_ We will have a navy to be proud\r\nof, and we'll make you admiral.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's one comfort,\" said an old society dame who now joined the\r\nparty. \"South Carolina is a fickle young thing and may change her mind!\r\nShe declared herself ready once before to walk out,—you all remember\r\nit,—and changed her mind. She took off her things and concluded to stay\r\na little longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"She has gone for good and all this time, depend upon it,\" said the\r\nhost. \"She was only giving warning then! Her time is up now and she is\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the lady of the house was telling the President news that was\r\nno news to him. He was fully prepared to receive it calmly and gravely.\r\nI had preceded her by some hours.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Porter little dreamed of the good fortune the secession of\r\nSouth Carolina would bring to him. From a poor lieutenant with anxious\r\ncares about a large family, he was speedily raised by Mr. Lincoln to\r\nthe proud position of rear-admiral of the United States.\r\n\r\nHis own comment upon the enthusiasm of his Southern friends is amusing.\r\nHe declared that if the capital and its surroundings had been less\r\nstupid, that if those vivacious Southerners could have had a court,\r\ntheatres, and opera-houses, the catastrophe which overwhelmed North and\r\nSouth might have been prevented. \"The Romans understood these things\r\nbetter than we. They omitted nothing to keep the people amused; they\r\neven had the street fountains at times run with wine, and the investment\r\nwas worth the money spent.\" \"But what,\" said Admiral Porter, \"could\r\none expect at a court presided over by an old bachelor whose heart was\r\ndead to poetry and love; who sat at dinner with no flowers to grace the\r\nfestive board, and never even had a _boutonnière_ on his coat lapel?\"\r\nwhich was one way, at least, of accounting for things.\r\n\r\nOf course, we all paid our respects to the President on the next New\r\nYear's Day, and joined the motley crowd of men and women of every degree\r\nwho were admitted after the starred and beribboned dignitaries from\r\nforeign lands had been received. \"Here I am, Mr. President,\" said one\r\nof the witty Southern women, \"and my cook will be here in a few minutes!\r\nI left her dressing to come.\"\r\n\r\nThe day that ushered in the eventful year 1861 was gloomy out of doors,\r\nbut within the Executive Mansion flowers, music, gay attire, and bright\r\nsmiles ruled the hour. \"I wish you a happy New Year, Mr. President,\"\r\nfell from every lip, but in every heart there was a gloomy foreboding of\r\nimpending disaster. What would the year bring to the \"wayward sister,\"\r\nwhose sons had all gone home? How we missed them!—Mr. Porcher Miles, Mr.\r\nBoyce, Mr. and Mrs. Keitt, always so delightful a part of our Washington\r\nsocial life. Some of us might expect to return; but this was adieu, not\r\n_au revoir_, to our President. This was his last New Year's Day in the\r\nWhite House, not his last day of perplexity and trouble. Very soon more\r\nwayward sisters would depart, and the hour he had dreaded would \"come\r\nin his time.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no time at the President's New Year's reception to gather in\r\ncorners for private talk. We must hurry on our rounds to the houses of\r\nthe Cabinet and of the foreign Ministers. Sending the gentlemen of our\r\nparty forward to visit the Senators' wives, we hastened home to our own\r\npunch-bowl.\r\n\r\nI brewed a mighty bowl that last New Year's Day. Dr. Garnett and Judge\r\nScarborough presided over the mixing, to be sure that the arrack was\r\nproportioned rightly, and that there were just as many and no more\r\ntoasted crab-apples than there should be. I was assisted by my friend\r\nAgnes, whom I love to quote, and whose full name I should like to give,\r\nexcept for the reason that she is now living, and, being a respectable\r\nlady of the old school, is averse from seeing her name in print. In\r\nthe society journal occasionally, apropos of the opera or reception,\r\nperhaps, but in a book! I should never be forgiven.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon my rooms were thronged—with Virginians and\r\nSoutherners mainly, but with some Northern friends as well, for Virginia\r\nwas not yet classed. Like Touchstone, I was \"in a parlous state,\" lest\r\nsome of my guests who had already honored many punch-bowls should\r\nventure on forbidden subjects. More than one came in on the arm of\r\nJames, but it took a better man than James to conduct him out again and\r\ninto his carriage. My friend who had distinguished himself at my first\r\nPresident's dinner was in high feather, as were some grave judges I\r\nknew.\r\n\r\nThere was but one thought in every mind, gay or sober. \"Is this a\r\nmeeting of the Girondists?\" queried one.\r\n\r\n     \"When shall we three meet again?\"\r\n\r\nquoted another.\r\n\r\n     \"When the hurly-burly's done—\r\n     When the battle's lost and won,\"\r\n\r\nwas the prompt answer. \"Sh-h-h!\" said an old army officer. \"It is not\r\nlucky to talk of lost battles on New Year's Day, nor of Girondists'\r\nfeasts on the eve of a revolution.\"\r\n\r\nThe season which was always ushered in on New Year's Day resolved itself\r\nliterally this year into a residence in the galleries of the Senate\r\nChamber and the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nBefore the 2d of February, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia,\r\nLouisiana, and Texas had dissolved their bonds with the Federal Union.\r\nThe farewell addresses of the Representatives of the seceded states\r\nbecame the regular order of the day. Jefferson Davis's final farewell\r\nclosed with these solemn words: \"May God have us in His holy keeping,\r\nand grant that, before it is too late, peaceful counsels may prevail.\"\r\n\r\nVirginia, had she retained her original colonial bounds, could\r\nhave dictated to the rest. Now, should she elect to join the\r\nSouthern Confederacy, the states she had given to the Union—her own\r\nchildren—would be arrayed against her.\r\n\r\nVirginia now essayed to arbitrate. Her Peace Commission met in\r\nWashington, but without result, except that it was for her a fleeting\r\nmoment of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg of Illinois said: \"She has thrown herself into the breach\r\nto turn aside the tide of disunion and revolution, and she says to the\r\nnation, 'Be united and be brothers again.' God bless the Old Dominion!\"\r\nSaid Mr. Bigler of Pennsylvania, January 21: \"Pennsylvania will _never_\r\nbecome the enemy of Virginia! Pennsylvania will never draw the sword on\r\nVirginia.\"\r\n\r\nApprehension was felt lest the new President's inaugural might be the\r\noccasion of rioting, if not of violence. We were advised to send our\r\nwomen and children out of the city. Hastily packing my personal and\r\nhousehold belongings to be sent after me, I took my little boys, with\r\ntheir faithful nurse, Eliza Page, on board the steamer to Acquia Creek,\r\nand, standing on deck as long as I could see the dome of the Capitol,\r\ncommenced my journey homeward. My husband remained behind, and kept his\r\nseat in Congress until Mr. Lincoln's inauguration. He described that\r\nmournful day to me—differing so widely from the happy installation of\r\nMr. Pierce. \"O'er all there hung a shadow and a fear.\" Every one was\r\noppressed by it, and no one more than the doomed President himself.\r\n\r\nWe were reunited a few weeks afterward at our father's house in\r\nPetersburg; and in a short time my young Congressman had become my\r\nyoung colonel—and Congressman as well, for as soon as Virginia seceded\r\nhe was elected to the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States of\r\nAmerica, and was commissioned colonel by Governor Letcher.\r\n\r\nI am afraid the evening is at hand, when we must bid adieu to the bright\r\ndays—the balls, the merry hair-dresser, the round of visits, the levees,\r\nthe charming \"at homes.\" The setting sun of such a day should pillow\r\nitself on golden clouds, bright harbingers of a morning of beauty and\r\nhappiness. Alas, alas! \"whom the gods destroy they first infatuate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nRAPID PROGRESS OF EVENTS AT THE SOUTH\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it was disclosed that a majority of the Virginia Convention opposed\r\ntaking the state out of the Union, the secessionists became greatly\r\nalarmed; for they knew that without the border states, of which Virginia\r\nwas the leader, the cotton states would be speedily crushed. They were\r\npositively certain, however, that, in the event of actual hostilities,\r\nVirginia would unite with her Southern associates. Accordingly, it was\r\ndetermined to bring a popular pressure to bear upon the government at\r\nMontgomery to make an assault on Fort Sumter. To that end my husband\r\nwent to Charleston, and delivered to an immense and enthusiastic\r\naudience, a most impassioned and vehement speech, urging the Southern\r\ntroops to \"strike a blow,\" and assuring them that in case of conflict,\r\nVirginia would secede \"within an hour by Shrewsbury clock.\" The blow\r\nwas struck; Mr. Lincoln called upon Virginia for a quota of troops to\r\nsubdue the rebellion, and the state immediately passed an ordinance of\r\nsecession.\r\n\r\nMr. Pryor, with other gentlemen, was deputed by General Beauregard to\r\ndemand the surrender of the fort, and in case of the refusal which he\r\nforesaw, to direct the commandant of battery, Johnson, to open fire.\r\nWhen the order was delivered to the commandant, he invited my husband\r\nto fire the first shot; but this honor my husband declined, and instead\r\nsuggested the venerable Edmund Ruffin, an intense secessionist, for that\r\nservice. It was the prevalent impression at the time, that Mr. Ruffin\r\ndid \"fire the first gun\"; at all events he fired, to him, the last; for\r\non hearing of Lee's surrender, Cato-like, he destroyed himself.\r\n\r\nI have often wondered what would have been the effect upon the fortunes\r\nof our own family, had my husband fired the shot that ushered in the\r\nwar. Even had his life been spared, he certainly would not have become\r\nan eminent lawyer in the state of New York and a justice of its Supreme\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nFort Sumter was reduced on April 12, and Virginia was in a wild state\r\nof excitement and confusion.\r\n\r\nThe deputation sent to Washington in the interests of peace had failed\r\nin its mission. The Convention of 1861 was in session at Richmond as\r\nearly as April 11—sitting with closed doors. The people were wrought to\r\nthe highest pitch of anxiety lest the conservative spirit of the older\r\nmen should triumph and should lead them to prefer submission, which\r\nwould mean dishonor, to secession, which could mean nothing worse than\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nBusiness was practically suspended in Richmond and Petersburg; men\r\ncrowded the streets to learn the latest news from the North, and were\r\ninflamed by reports of the arrest and incarceration in Fort Lafayette\r\nof Southern sympathizers. As crowds gathered in different localities the\r\nadvocates of secession addressed them in impassioned speeches which met\r\nwith hearty response from the people.\r\n\r\nOn April 16, a body, calling itself the Spontaneous People's Convention,\r\nmet and organized in the Metropolitan Hall at Richmond. The door was\r\nkept by a guard with a drawn sword in his hand. David Chalmers of\r\nHalifax County was president, and Willoughby Newton, vice-president.\r\n\r\nPatrick Henry Aylett, grandson of Patrick Henry, made a noble speech,\r\nurging moderation and delay; warmer speeches followed. A Southern flag\r\nwas raised on the capitol amid shouts of applause, but at midnight\r\nthe governor had it removed, for the convention had not yet passed the\r\nordinance of secession, and those who rose with the dawn of the next\r\neventful day found the state flag calmly floating in its place.\r\n\r\nI was a guest of the government house at this time, and in the calm and\r\nseclusion of Mrs. Letcher's rooms I missed much of the excitement. She\r\nwas a motherly, domestic woman, who chose to ignore outside disturbances\r\nfor the sake of present peace. We talked together of family matters, as\r\nwe sewed upon little gowns and pinafores, indulged in reminiscences of\r\nthe Washington life which we had enjoyed together, and said very little\r\nof the troubles of the hour. Mrs. Letcher thought the political storm\r\nmust pass. It was hard to bear; the governor was nervous and sleeping\r\nbadly, but quiet would surely come, and when it did—why, then, we would\r\nall go down to Old Point Comfort for June, bathe in the sea, and get\r\nstrong and well. As for fighting—it would never come to that!\r\n\r\nOn the memorable day of the 17th the \"Spontaneous Convention\" again\r\nmet to discuss a new political organization of the state. While they\r\nargued and struggled, Lieutenant-Governor Montague entered the hall\r\nwith momentous news. An ordinance of secession had been passed by the\r\nState Convention. This announcement was followed by a thrilling moment\r\nof silence succeeded by tears of gladness and deafening shouts of\r\napplause. The venerable ex-President Tyler made a stirring address. He\r\ngave a brief history of the struggles of the English race from the days\r\nof the Magna Charta to the present time, and solemnly declared that at\r\nno period of the history of our race had we ever been engaged in a more\r\njust and holy effort for the maintenance of liberty and independence\r\nthan at the present moment. The career of the dominant party at the\r\nNorth was but a series of aggressions which fully warranted our eternal\r\nseparation; and if we performed our duty as Christian patriots, the\r\nsame God who favored the cause of our forefathers in the Revolution\r\nof 1776 would crown our efforts with success. Generations yet unborn\r\nwould bless those who had the high privilege of participating in the\r\npresent struggle. A passionate speech followed from ex-Governor Wise.\r\nHe alluded to a rumor that one of his children had been seized and held\r\nas hostage at the North. \"But,\" he said, \"if they suppose hostages of\r\nmy own heart's blood will stay my hand in the maintenance of sacred\r\nrights, they are mistaken. Affection for kindred, property, and life\r\nitself sink into insignificance in comparison with the overwhelming\r\nimportance of public duty in such a crisis as this. Virginia is smitten\r\nwith blindness, in that she does not at once seize Washington before\r\nthe Republican hordes get possession of it.\" The Hon. J. M. Mason and\r\nothers followed in the same strain. Governor Letcher appeared, and\r\npledged himself to discharge his whole duty as executive of the state\r\nin conformity with the will of the people and the provisions of the\r\nconstitution. The ordinance could not become a law until it was ratified\r\nby the people—and they would be called to vote upon it on May 23. \"Not\r\nuntil then,\" said an ex-Congressman, \"will those fellows in Washington\r\nknow we are Secessionists!\" \"_Never_ as Secessionists!\" said another;\r\n\"I detest the word. We are revolutionists,—rebels, as our fathers\r\nwere.\" \"But perhaps,\" ventured one of the old Washington coterie, to\r\nMr. Hunter, \"perhaps the people will not vote us out of the Union after\r\nall.\" \"My dear lady,\" said the ex-Senator, proudly, \"you may place\r\nyour little hand against Niagara with more certainty of staying the\r\ntorrent than you can oppose this movement. It was written long ago in\r\nthe everlasting stars that the South would be driven out of the Union\r\nby the North.\"\r\n\r\nThe fate of Virginia had been decided April 15, when President Lincoln\r\ndemanded troops for the subjugation of the seceding states of the South.\r\nThe temper of Governor Letcher of Virginia was precisely in accord with\r\nthe spirit that prompted Governor Magoffin of Kentucky to answer to a\r\nsimilar call for state militia: \"Kentucky will furnish no troops for the\r\nwicked purpose of subduing her sister Southern states!\" Until this call\r\nof the President, Virginia had been extremely averse from secession, and\r\neven though she deemed it within her rights to leave the Union, she did\r\nnot wish to pledge herself to join the Confederate States of the South.\r\nVirginia was the Virginian's Country. The common people were wont to\r\nspeak of her as \"The Old Mother.\" \"The mother of us all,\" a mother so\r\nhonored and loved that her brood of children must be noble and true.\r\n\r\nHer sons had never forgotten her! She had fought nobly in the Revolution\r\nand had afterward surrendered, for the common good, her magnificent\r\nterritory. Had she retained this vast dominion, she could now have\r\ndictated to all the other states. She gave it up from a pure spirit\r\nof patriotism—that there might be the fraternity which could not exist\r\nwithout equality,—and in surrendering it, she had reserved for herself\r\nthe right to withdraw from the Confederation whenever she should deem it\r\nexpedient for her own welfare. There were leading spirits who thought\r\nthe hour had come when she might demand her right. She was not on a\r\nplane with the other states of the Union. \"Virginia, New York, and\r\nMassachusetts had expressly reserved the right to withdraw from the\r\nUnion, and explicitly disclaimed the right or power to bind the hands\r\nof posterity by any form of government whatever.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so the question of the hour with Virginia was not the right to\r\nintroduce slavery into the territories. Nothing was said or thought\r\nabout slavery. The question was of states' rights only.\r\n\r\nOne need but go back to the original treaties with France and England\r\nin 1778 and 1783, to understand the origin and root of this feeling\r\nwith the Virginians of 1861. France had made her treaty of perpetual\r\nalliance with the \"Thirteen United Colonies,\" naming each one separately\r\nas one of the contracting parties. The king of England had named each\r\none separately to be \"free, sovereign and independent states\" and \"that\r\nhe treated with them as such.\"\r\n\r\nSaid old John Janney, a Union man and president of the Convention of\r\n1861, when taxed with having taken sides with Virginia against the\r\nUnion, \"Virginia, sir, was a nation one hundred and eighty years before\r\nyour Union was born.\"\r\n\r\nAnother strong party was the \"Union Party,\" sternly resolved against\r\nsecession, willing to run the risks of fighting within the Union for\r\nthe rights of the state. This spirit was so strong, that any hint of\r\nsecession had been met with angry defiance. A Presbyterian clergyman\r\nhad ventured, in his morning sermon, a hint that Virginia might need her\r\nsons for defence, when a gray-haired elder left the church and, turning\r\nat the door, shouted \"Traitor!\" This was in Petersburg, the birthplace\r\nof General Winfield Scott.\r\n\r\nAnd still another party was the enthusiastic secession party, resolved\r\nupon resistance to coercion; the men who could believe nothing good of\r\nthe North, should interests of that section conflict with those of the\r\nSouth; who cherished the bitterest resentments for all the sneers and\r\ninsults in Congress; who, like the others, adored their own state and\r\nwere ready and willing to die in her defence. Strange to say, this was\r\nthe predominating spirit all through the country, in rural districts as\r\nwell as in the small towns and the larger cities. It seemed to be born\r\nall at once in every breast as soon as Lincoln demanded the soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe \"overt act\" for which everybody looked had been really the\r\nreënforcement by Federal troops of the fort in Charleston Harbor. When\r\nFort Sumter was reduced by Beauregard, \"the fight was on.\"\r\n\r\nOn May 23 Virginia ratified an ordinance of secession, and on the\r\nearly morning of May 24 the Federal soldiers, under General Winfield\r\nScott,[11] crossed the Potomac River and occupied Arlington Heights\r\nand the city of Alexandria. \"The invasion of Virginia, the pollution of\r\nher sacred soil as it was termed, called forth a vigorous proclamation\r\nfrom her governor and a cry of rage from her press.\" General Beauregard\r\nissued a fierce proclamation, tending to fire the hearts of the\r\nVirginians with anger. \"A reckless and unprincipled host,\" he declared,\r\n\"has invaded your soil,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott, our father's groomsman, was knocking at the doors of the\r\n\"fair ladies\" he loved, with the menace of torch and sword.\r\n\r\nAnd now there was a mighty gathering of the sons of \"The Old Mother!\"\r\nShe raised her standard, \"_Sic semper tyrannis_,\" and from every\r\nquarter of the globe they rallied to her defence, not scurrying home for\r\nshelter from the storm, but coming to place their own breasts between\r\nher and the blast,—descendants of men who had won freedom in 1776, of\r\nLight Horse Harry Lee, of Peter Johnson, Ensign of the Legion,—Robert\r\nE. Lee, Joseph E. Johnston, Thomas Jackson, \"Jeb\" Stuart, A. P. Hill,\r\nMuscoe Garnett, Roger A. Pryor, Austin Smith from far San Francisco,\r\nDr. Garnett from Washington, Bradfute Warwick from Naples, Powhatan\r\nClark from Louisiana, Judge Scarborough from the Court of Claims at\r\nWashington, Judge Campbell, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court at\r\nWashington, and multitudes of others! \"The very earth trembled at the\r\ntramp of the Virginians as they marched to the assize of arms of the\r\nMother of them all. From every continent, from every clime, from all\r\navocations, from the bar, the pulpit, the counting-room, the workshop,\r\nthe Virginians came.\r\n\r\n     \"'Theirs not to reason why,\r\n     Theirs but to do and die!'\"[12]\r\n\r\nAmong them was a descendant of old Sir Humphrey Gilbert,—him of the\r\nsinking ship on his way to Virginia,—who cried as he went down: \"Be of\r\ngood cheer, my friends! It is as near heaven by sea as by land.\"\r\n\r\nAnd among them were some who quoted old Sir George Somers of the _Sea\r\nVenture_, who drew around him his crew and exhorted them to \"be true to\r\nduty and to return to Virginia.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Bradley Johnson says these words of the old knight rang like a\r\ntrumpet all over the country in the early days of the war wherever there\r\nwas a Virginian. \"Be true to duty and return to Virginia!\" And few, very\r\nfew, failed to obey the call.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that General Lee did not approve the hasty,\r\nill-considered action of the early seceders from the Union. He foresaw\r\nthe perils and doubtful results of such action. He knew that war—as my\r\nown husband had so earnestly said in Congress—\"meant widows and orphans,\r\nthe punishment of the innocent, the ruin of the fortunes of all.\" Still,\r\nthe \"Old Mother\" had been forced to accept it at the hands of others.\r\nThe simple question was: \"With or against blood and kin? For or against\r\nthe Old Mother?\" And the question answered itself in the asking.\r\n\r\nI am sure that no soldier enlisted under Virginia's banner could\r\npossibly be more determined than the young women of the state. They were\r\nuncompromising.\r\n\r\n\"You promised me my answer to-night,\" said a fine young fellow, who had\r\nnot yet enlisted, to his sweetheart.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you can't have it, Ben, until you have fought the Yankees,\" said\r\npretty Helen.\r\n\r\n\"What heart will I have for fighting if you give me no promise?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll not be engaged to any man until he has fought the Yankees,\" said\r\nHelen, firmly. \"You distinguish yourself in the war, and then see what\r\nI'll have to say to you.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the stand they took in Richmond and Petersburg. Engagements\r\nwere postponed until they could find of what mettle a lover was.\r\n\r\n\"But suppose I don't come back at all!\" suggested Ben.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then I'll acknowledge an engagement and be good to your mother,—and\r\nwear mourning all the same—_provided_—your wounds are all in front.\"\r\n\r\nA few days before the vote was taken upon the ordinance of secession\r\nwe had a fine fright in Richmond. An alarm was rung in the Capitol\r\nSquare, and thousands of people filled the streets to learn the cause\r\nof its warning. Presently notices were posted all over the city that\r\nthe _Pawnee_—a war-ship of the United States—was steaming up the James\r\nRiver with the purpose of shelling the mansions on the banks, and of\r\nfinally firing on Richmond. We had friends living in those fine colonial\r\nmansions all along the river,—at Claremont, Upper and Lower Brandon,\r\nShirley, Westover,—dear old ladies who were unprotected, and would be\r\nfrightened to death. For ourselves in Richmond and Petersburg there\r\nwould be no personal danger, we could escape; but our mills and shipping\r\nwould be destroyed.\r\n\r\nI think I am within the bounds of truth when I say that every man and\r\nboy capable of bearing gun or pistol marched with the soldiers and\r\nartillery down to the riverside, determined to defend the city. There\r\nthey waited until the evening, the howitzers firing from time to time\r\nto forewarn the war-ship of their presence.\r\n\r\nA little after sunset the crowd turned its face homeward. News had been\r\nreceived that the _Pawnee_ had steamed up the river a short distance,\r\nhad thought better of it, and had turned around and gone back to her\r\nmooring. All the same one thing was certain, the war-ship \"bristling\r\nwith guns\" was there. She _could_ steam up the river any night, and\r\nprobably would when it pleased her so to do.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to my father's home in Petersburg, I found my friends\r\npossessed with an intense spirit of patriotism. The First, Second,\r\nand Third Virginia were already mustered into service; my husband was\r\ncolonel of the Third Virginia Infantry. The men were to be equipped for\r\nservice immediately. All of \"the boys\" were going—the three Mays, Will\r\nJohnson, Berry Stainback, Ned Graham, all the young, dancing set, the\r\nyoung lawyers and doctors—everybody, in short, except bank presidents,\r\ndruggists, a doctor or two (over age), and young boys under sixteen.\r\n\r\nTo be idle was torture. We women resolved ourselves into a sewing\r\nsociety—resting not on Sundays. Sewing-machines were put into the\r\nchurches, which became depots for flannel, muslin, strong linen, and\r\neven uniform cloth. When the hour for meeting arrived, the sewing class\r\nwould be summoned by the ringing of the church bell. My dear Agnes was\r\nvisiting in Petersburg, and was my faithful ally in all my work. We\r\ninstituted a monster sewing class, which we hugely enjoyed, to meet\r\ndaily at my home on Market Street. My Colonel was to be fitted out as\r\nnever was colonel before. He was ordered to Norfolk with his regiment to\r\nprotect the seaboard. I was proud of his colonelship, and much exercised\r\nbecause he had no shoulder-straps. I undertook to embroider them myself.\r\nWe had not then decided upon the star for our colonels' insignia, and I\r\nsupposed he would wear the eagle like all the colonels I had ever known.\r\nNo embroidery bullion was to be had, but I bought heavy bullion fringe,\r\ncut it in lengths, and made eagles, probably of some extinct species,\r\nfor the like were unknown in Audubon's time, and have not since been\r\ndiscovered. However, they were accepted, admired, and, what is worse,\r\nworn.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate soldier was furnished at the beginning of the war with a\r\ngun, pistol, canteen, tin cup, haversack, and knapsack—no inconsiderable\r\nweight to be borne in a march. The knapsack contained a fatigue jacket,\r\none or two blankets, an oilcloth, several suits of underclothing,\r\nseveral pairs of white gloves, collars, neckties, and handkerchiefs.\r\nEach mess purchased a mess-chest containing dishes, bowls, plates,\r\nknives, forks, spoons, cruets, spice-boxes, glasses, etc. Each mess also\r\nowned a frying-pan, oven, coffee-pot, and camp-kettle. The uniforms were\r\nof the finest cadet cloth and gold lace.\r\n\r\nThis outfit—although not comparable to that of the Federal soldiers,\r\nmany of whom had \"Saratoga\" trunks in the baggage train, was considered\r\nsumptuous by the Confederate volunteer.\r\n\r\nAs if these were not enough, we taxed our ingenuity to add sundry\r\ncomforts, weighing little, by which we might give a touch of refinement\r\nto the soldier's knapsack.\r\n\r\nThere was absolutely nothing which a man might possibly use that we did\r\nnot make for them. We embroidered cases for razors, for soap and sponge,\r\nand cute morocco affairs for needles, thread, and court-plaster, with\r\na little pocket lined with a bank-note. \"How perfectly ridiculous!\" do\r\nyou say? Nothing is ridiculous that helps anxious women to bear their\r\nlot—cheats them with the hope that they are doing good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA AGAIN THE BATTLE-GROUND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day came at last when our regiments were to march. They were to\r\nrendezvous at the head of Sycamore Street, and march down to the lower\r\ndepot. Every old man and boy, matron, maiden, and child, every family\r\nservant, assembled to bid them God-speed.\r\n\r\nThe reigning belles and beauties of Petersburg were all there,—Alice\r\nGregory, Tabb Bolling, Molly and Augusta Banister, Patty Hardee, Mary\r\nand Marion Meade, pretty Helen, and my own friend Agnes.\r\n\r\n\"We are not to cry, you know,\" said Agnes, laying down the law by right\r\nof seniority.\r\n\r\n\"Of _course_ not!\" said Helen, winking away her tears and smiling.\r\n\r\nJust then the inspiring notes of \"Dixie,\" with drum and clash of cymbal,\r\nrent the air—the first time I had heard that battle-song.\r\n\r\n\"Forward! March!\" And they were moving in solid ranks, all of us keeping\r\nstep on the sidewalk, down to the depot.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: APPOMATTOX.]\r\n\r\nWhen the men were on board, and the wheels began to move, Ben leaned\r\nout of his window and whispered to Helen, just below him:—\r\n\r\n\"Can't I have the promise now, Helen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, Ben—_dear_ Ben, I promise!\" and as the cars rolled away she\r\nturned and calmly announced, \"Girls, I'm engaged to Ben Shepard.\"\r\n\r\n\"_I'm_ engaged to half a dozen of them,\" said one.\r\n\r\n\"That's nothing,\" said another, \"_I'm_ engaged to the whole regiment.\"\r\n\r\nPoor little Helen—but I must not anticipate.\r\n\r\nAfter the soldiers left, silence and anxiety fell upon the town like a\r\npall. What should we do next? This was the question we asked each other;\r\nand it was answered by one of our dear women.\r\n\r\n\"We will hold a prayer meeting in each other's houses, at four o'clock\r\nevery afternoon. We can _pray_, if we cannot fight.\"\r\n\r\nThis meeting was held daily throughout the years of the war—and comfort\r\nthrough its influence came to many a sorrowful heart.\r\n\r\nBut the lull was of short duration. The South was sending troops to help\r\nold Virginia.\r\n\r\nI think Beauregard's veterans can never forget their reception in\r\nPetersburg. We were forewarned of their coming. We sent our servants\r\nladen with trays of refreshments, we went ourselves to the depot\r\nwith flowers. Beauregard, our idol, the gallant, dashing Beauregard,\r\nhurriedly shook hands with us and filled his arms with our flowers;\r\nthen,—\"All aboard,\"—and off again, to be heard from very soon at Bull\r\nRun.\r\n\r\nOther regiments passed through town, and none left without being\r\nrefreshed. The railroad whistles instructed us as to numbers.\r\n\r\nIt was a happy day for me when a telegram came from my Colonel at\r\nNorfolk: \"Suppose you pay me a visit!\" There could be but one answer.\r\n\r\nWhen the day of my departure arrived I was at the depot of the train\r\nwhich was to take me to City Point, long before the time of starting;\r\nand when I reached the terminus of the short railroad, I was in terror\r\nlest the Richmond boat might have gone on its way without stopping for\r\nus. Would it never come? Surely something had happened! \"Oh, Captain,\" I\r\ncried for the third time, as that functionary paced to and fro in front\r\nof his little engine, \"do you think the boat—\" \"In a moment, lady,\" said\r\nthe Captain, \"the boat is just coming round the Point;\" and sure enough,\r\nthere she was, slowing up to pick up the happiest woman in the world.\r\n\r\nI can imagine few journeys more delightful than a sail down the James\r\nRiver on a lovely summer day. The river itself is not a clear stream of\r\nsilver like the Potomac. Every stream that enters it is yellow with the\r\npeculiar clay of the country through which it passes. But the James is,\r\n_par excellence_, the romantic river of our country, though not like\r\nthe beautiful Hudson, misty with the dreams of Washington Irving. The\r\nhistoric James needs no imaginings to enhance its charm. Seated on the\r\nforward deck, one glides softly over enchanted waters. Could the veil\r\nwhich hides the future have been lifted from my vision on this glorious\r\nnoonday, what would have been my sensations. Here at City Point, in\r\nthe venerable ivy-clad home of the Eppes family, General Grant would in\r\nthree short years make his headquarters, and would entertain President\r\nLincoln, General Sherman, and Admiral Porter.\r\n\r\nAcross the river the elegant colonial house of Shirley was basking in\r\nthe summer sun. Here the Carters had lived since 1720. Here Light Horse\r\nHarry Lee had found his sweet wife, Anne Hill Carter. Here, too, was the\r\nfine portrait of Washington by Peale, and other Revolutionary treasures.\r\n\r\nNext to Shirley, a little higher up the river, was Turkey Island,\r\nwhere the English explorers had rejoiced to find, in great numbers, the\r\nChristmas bird, known in the mother country as early as 1527. Here had\r\nlived the wealthy king's councilman, William Randolph, who had come to\r\nVirginia in the good times after King Charlie had returned to \"enjoy\r\nhis own again\"; and here he had built a goodly house, with a portico on\r\nthree sides, surmounted by a dome visible a great way off to navigators\r\nof the James River, the whole surmounted by an aërial structure called\r\nthe \"bird cage because many birds do hover and sing about it.\" Seven\r\nyears were required to complete this mansion—and all these seven years,\r\ndoubtless, its master was serving like Jacob, hoping to cage one fair\r\nbird for himself.\r\n\r\nJust across the river, at Bermuda Hundred, lived Henry Isham, Gent:\r\nand his wife Dame Katherine; and thither came William Randolph to smoke\r\nwith the master \"a pipe of tobacco kept in a lily pot, cut on a maple\r\nblock, lighted with a coal taken with silver tongs from a brasier of\r\njuniper\"—for these were the incantations wherewith the early Virginian\r\nwooed the subtle influences of the new gift of the gods. And as they\r\nsmoked, pretty Mary Isham played on her \"cittern\" to the soothing\r\naccompaniment of the lapping waves of the river. She was a fit mate for\r\nthe young aristocrat. He could trace his lineage \"from the great Earls\r\nMurray, nay, from royalty itself\"; but gentle Mary could boast on her\r\nfamily tree nobler fruit than these: the Dukes of Normandy—Longue-Epée\r\nand Sanspeur—Hugh Capet of France; the Saxon kings of England; the\r\nMagna Charta barons; and that noble house of De Vere, which bore on its\r\nstandard the lone star, because one of their blood, hard pressed in a\r\nbattle of the Crusades, had seen in a vision a star fall from heaven and\r\nalight upon his shield. And so it came that William and Mary Randolph\r\nwere parents of seven noble sons, and from them descended the great men\r\nof colonial and Revolutionary Virginia—Thomas Jefferson, Richard Bland,\r\nChief Justice Marshall, Robert E. Lee. In all these times,—prominent in\r\ncouncil, in the college, in the halls of the Executive at Philadelphia,\r\nwearing the ermine, in the presidential chair, at the bar, in the pulpit\r\nof the Established Church, in the march, in the battle-field,—in every\r\nplace where character, wisdom, and gallant bearing were needed, we find\r\nthe descendants of William and Mary Randolph.\r\n\r\nThese were the things of which I proudly thought (for these were\r\nmy Colonel's own people) as I was slowly borne along to other\r\nlocalities,—many of them where the Randolphs had lived,—all of them\r\nlinked together in one chain of historic interest. The old Randolph\r\nmansion still existed in part, although its fine dome and pillared\r\nporticoes had fallen into decay. As I turned my reverent eyes to this\r\nMecca, how would I have been cut to the heart had the future—the near\r\nfuture—been revealed to me. In one short year McClellan would, before\r\nproceeding to Harrison's Landing, rest after the disasters of the Seven\r\nDays' Battles under the roof-tree at Turkey Island, and his gunboats\r\nwould shell the old mansion and level it to the ground when it no longer\r\nsheltered their commander.\r\n\r\nA bend of the river now revealed Jordan's Point, where lived in colonial\r\nand Revolutionary days Richard Bland, the antiquary, statesman, and\r\npatriot, over whose grave the \"martial ranks of corn\" were now waving,\r\nthrough the stupidity of a recreant descendant. There was no house on\r\nJordan's Point wherein the restless ghost of pretty Cicely Jordan might\r\nhold tryst with her many lovers, or where the wraith of the wise old\r\nantiquary might be discerned, bending over the books \"which he studieth\r\nmuch.\" Pretty, rich, fascinating Cicely had in 1623 created so much\r\ndisturbance in the colony by her utter inability to refuse a suitor,\r\nthat she was the occasion of the famous law enacting punishment for\r\nwomen who promised marriage to more than one man at a time. Here at\r\n\"Jordan's\" had lived another Mary—Mary Bland—and thence Henry Lee had\r\nborne her to Westmoreland; and Henry and Mary Lee were the grandparents\r\nof Light Horse Harry, the father of our beloved Robert E. Lee. Here,\r\ntoo, at Jordan's, Nathaniel Bacon had encamped his followers, before\r\nleading them to avenge the outrages of the Indians.\r\n\r\nBut as I mused of these things we were passing Berkley, where lived\r\nGiles Bland, who was executed for following Nathaniel Bacon; afterward\r\nthe home of the Harrison who signed the Declaration of Independence,\r\nthe father of \"old Tippecanoe,\" President William Henry Harrison. If the\r\nveil of the future had been lifted, I should have seen General McClellan\r\nresting on the veranda here after his retreat from Malvern Hills, the\r\nfields for miles around covered with his tents, the waters alive with\r\nwar vessels and transports.\r\n\r\nNow, as I passed, the tired cattle, gathered under the shade of a great\r\noak near the river, were chewing in contentment the midday cud; and at\r\nan outhouse within sight, a woman was setting out her newly washed milk\r\npails to be sweetened by the sun after her noonday dinner.\r\n\r\nNext in interest came Westover—the fine house built by Colonel William\r\nByrd, to whose father my children's ancestor had sold it. \"The wise\r\nand prudent Theodorick Bland\" was sleeping there, I knew, behind the\r\ntombstone which recorded his wisdom and prudence, and on which his own\r\nand his wife's arms were quartered, she having been the daughter of the\r\nColonial Governor Richard Bennett. Near him in the graveyard lay the\r\nmortal remains of Evelyn Byrd—whose restless spirit slept not ever, but\r\nmight be seen on moonlight nights gliding among the roses.\r\n\r\nThen \"Pace's Pains,\" where lived the Christian Indian Chanco, who\r\nrevealed the plan for the wholesale massacre of the English in 1622,\r\nand who saved Jamestown by a message at dawn to the authorities of the\r\ntown; and Argall's Point, where the settlers were slain in the Indian\r\nmassacre of 1619; and Jamestown, where the good Mr. Hunt stretched a\r\nsail between two trees for an altar, consecrating the first church,\r\nfloored by the leaves and flowers of the forest and roofed by the blue\r\nsky of heaven. And Argall's—once called Paspahegh—where Nathaniel Bacon\r\nhad halted his \"tyred forlorne Body of men\" to rest them before marching\r\non to Jamestown.\r\n\r\nAnd so on and on—past Weyanoke and Brandon with its art treasures—and\r\nMartin's Hundred, where the colonists were massacred in 1622.\r\n\r\nHow peacefully the old river glided between its banks. Now and then\r\nvoices reached us from the shores, or we paused at a busy landing to\r\nleave a mail-bag, or to deliver packages and barrels for the dwellers\r\ninland; or the gang-plank would be lowered for some planter going home\r\nto his family, and soon pulled up, the great paddle-wheels churning the\r\nthick muddy water into a creamy froth, as we were off again.\r\n\r\nAs late evening drew on the river became dark, but less silent. We\r\npassed numbers of little skiffs with a single wing and a red eye astern,\r\nin which the fisherman was hurrying home, sometimes singing as he\r\nsailed. Overhead the homing birds flapped their heavy wings.\r\n\r\nA sense of peace and calm stole over me. War? Oh, surely, surely not!\r\nSomething would prevent it. Surely, blood would not be shed because of\r\nthose insulting words in the Senate and House. God was our Father—the\r\nFather of all. Were we not children of His covenant—His blessing\r\npromised to the third and fourth generation? Was not the blood of the\r\nsaints in our veins?\r\n\r\nIf the veil could have been lifted, if one had said, \"Behold, I shew\r\nyou a vision—you may yet avert its fulfilment,\" how merciful would that\r\nhave been! Could this have been vouchsafed me, I might have had unrolled\r\nbefore me, that fourteenth day of June,—just three years away,—when\r\nthe man who was now drilling a small company of volunteers in Galena\r\nwould be in these waters, crossing the James at the head of 115,000 men,\r\nsweeping for two days and nights over three lines of pontoons, marching\r\nhorse, foot, artillery, and train, straight to the spot whence I had\r\ncome in the morning of this day, going on their victorious way to lay\r\nsiege to Richmond and Petersburg, and destined to overwhelm us in the\r\nend.\r\n\r\nAnd now it was quite dark on the river. Phantom ships flashed now and\r\nthen out of the darkness, and were swallowed up again. Was that the\r\n_Goodspeed_, or the _Susan Constant_, or perhaps the _Discovery_? Hark!\r\nwas that a war-whoop?\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: WESTOVER.]\r\n\r\nOnly the warning whistle of our own boat, as I discovered upon awaking.\r\nBefore me stood the dignified old colored woman who held the proud\r\nposition of stewardess of our boat, and beside her a young assistant who\r\ngently removed and began to fold the shawl I had tucked around my knees.\r\n\r\n\"Honey,\" said the old dame, \"ain't you 'fraid you'll ketch cole out\r\nhere so late?—it's time for you to go to bed. The cap'n sent me for you.\r\nYo' state-room is nice an' cool now. The potehole been open ever since\r\nsundown.\"\r\n\r\nI was awake and dressed by sunrise next day, our boat having arrived\r\nafter midnight at the wharf in Norfolk—and in due time the clanking of\r\nspurs announced my Colonel! Very fine did he look in his uniform, with\r\nmy eagles bristling on each shoulder.\r\n\r\nThere was to be a dress-parade that day, in the afternoon, and he\r\ndesired me to join the ladies of the hotel in the drawing-room after\r\nbreakfast and present with his compliments an invitation to the parade.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know when and where I can see the ladies of this hotel?\" I asked\r\nmy smiling colored chambermaid.\r\n\r\n\"Lor', lady, dey ain't fur off,\" she said. \"Dey mostly sets all day in\r\nde shady side of de po'ch pickin' lint. Dey certainly makes a heap o'\r\nmuss. Nobody can't say nuthin' to 'em; cause deyse guests of de hotel.\r\nAn' 'tain't one bit o' use. Nobody gwine to git hurt, an' if dey does,\r\nwhat's de use of all dat sticky cotton?\"\r\n\r\nI found a number of ladies engaged in the veranda, but not as she had\r\nsuggested. They were very glad to meet me, and accepted my invitation.\r\nThey were making square bags out of bunting for cartridges. A gentle,\r\nblue-eyed woman joined us and asked for work. But when it was explained\r\nto her, she colored, her lips quivered. \"Oh, I can't! I can't!\"\r\nshe begged. \"Let me roll bandages for wounds! I can't help with the\r\ncartridges! You see, all my people live in Pennsylvania. My husband is\r\ngoing to fight them, I know; but don't ask me to make the cartridges.\"\r\n\r\nMy Colonel came himself with his staff in the afternoon to escort us\r\nto his headquarters at the Marine Hospital. On our way we passed an\r\nabandoned house, on the walls of which grew the most glorious specimen\r\nof fuchsia I ever beheld. I had always heard that this was a marine\r\nplant, and I now saw to what perfection it could be brought in the sea\r\nair. It reached to the second story and was covered with a shower of\r\ngreat scarlet and blue bells. \"Dixie colors,\" said one of the ladies.\r\nWe gathered gorgeous bunches and fastened them in our white dresses.\r\n\r\nThe parade ground was a lovely stretch of green, and beyond, the blue\r\nwaters of the sea sparkled in the afternoon sun, each little wave gemmed\r\nwith a diamond and set in sapphire.\r\n\r\nA siege gun had just been mounted, and there was to be practice-firing\r\nat a buoy for a mark.\r\n\r\nI was standing with my group of friends when a handsome officer\r\napproached with a military salute and invited me to honor his company by\r\nfiring their first gun. I went forward with him, and he put the lanyard\r\nin my hands.\r\n\r\n\"Wait for the word of command, Madam,\" he said.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LOWER BRANDON.]\r\n\r\n\"And then what?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then _pull_ steadily,\" and with that he stepped back.\r\n\r\n\"Make ready! Fire!\"\r\n\r\nI pulled the lanyard—but I was unprepared for the result. The great gun\r\nbacked, leaped in the air and sent a mighty roar across the waters,—the\r\nfirst cannon fired by the Third Virginia Volunteers. I received the\r\ncongratulations and thanks of the Captain, and returned to my place—to\r\nbe told that my eyes were congested by the concussion, and that I must\r\nreturn home and bathe and bandage them at once. Evidently I was not fit\r\nfor artillery service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nLIFE AT THE OAKS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe month of July, 1861, found me with my little boys at \"The Oaks\"—the\r\nresidence of Dr. Izard Bacon Rice, in Charlotte County, seventy miles\r\nfrom Richmond, and miles away from the nearest railroad depot. There I\r\nmight have enjoyed a peaceful summer with my kind host—a fine type of\r\na Christian gentleman, sometime an Old-Line Whig and fierce Union man,\r\nnow an ardent advocate of states' rights, and a stanch supporter of the\r\nNew Confederacy. I might—as I had often done before—have revelled in the\r\nfine trees; the broad acres of tobacco in their summer prime, when the\r\nnoble plant was proudly flinging out its banners before its fall; the\r\nold garden with its box-edged crescents, stars, and circles,—I might\r\nhave dreamed away the summer in perfect contentment but for General\r\nBeauregard. Distant as was his army, a message from his guns reached my\r\nsummer retreat more than a hundred miles away.\r\n\r\nDr. Rice lived in a large, old-fashioned house, on a plantation of two\r\nthousand acres or more. An oak grove, alive with chattering squirrels\r\nwhich had been held sacred for two generations, surrounded the house.\r\nThe squirrels held conventions in the trees, and doubtless expressed\r\ntheir opinions of the family below, whom they had good reason to\r\nconsider inferior beings, inasmuch as they were slow-motioned, heavy\r\ncreatures, utterly destitute of grace and agility, and with small\r\nappreciation of hickory-nuts.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor cultivated tobacco, and when I arrived the fields stretched\r\nas far as the eye could reach, now a vast level sea of green, now\r\ncovering the low, gently rounded, undulating hills as they sloped down\r\nto the Staunton River. There was never a season when these fields were\r\nnot alive with laborers of every age; for the regal plant so beloved\r\nof men—and ranking with opium and hemp as a solace for the ills of\r\nmankind—has enemies from the hour it peeps from the nursery of the hot\r\nbed. It can never be forgotten a moment. Children can hunt the fly which\r\nseeks to line the leaf with eggs, or destroy the unhatched eggs, or aid\r\nthe great army which must turn out in haste when the ravenous worm is\r\nborn. The earth must be turned frequently at the roots, the flower buds\r\npinched off, the shoots or \"suckers\" removed. The Doctor's tobacco field\r\nwas an enlivening spectacle, and very picturesque did the ebony faces\r\nof the little workers look, among the broad leaves. No lady's garden\r\nwas ever kept so clean, so free from sticks, errant bits of paper, or\r\ndébris of any kind.\r\n\r\nI do not claim that Dr. Rice (my uncle) was a typical planter—as far as\r\nthe government of his slaves was concerned. He had inherited liberal\r\nideas with these inherited slaves. His grandfather, David Rice, had\r\nwritten the first published protest in this country against slavery\r\nas \"inconsistent with religion and policy.\" His father had ruled a\r\nplantation where severe punishment was unknown, where the cheerful\r\nslaves rarely needed it. The old gentleman was considered eccentric—and\r\neccentric it surely was for a master to punish a fault by commanding\r\nthe culprit to stand in his presence while he recited a long passage\r\nfrom Homer or Virgil! The punishment was effective. For fear of it, the\r\nfault was rarely repeated.\r\n\r\nIt was my uncle's custom to assemble every slave on his plantation on\r\nSunday morning, and to speak a few words to each one, commending the\r\nwomen if their families appeared in clean, well-kept garments, rewarding\r\nwith a pair of shoes the urchins reported by \"Uncle Moses\" as having\r\nbeen orderly and useful, exchanging a pleasant jest here and there.\r\n\r\nHe presented a tight, comfortable house to every newly married pair,\r\nwith timber for the bridegroom to add to it, or to enclose the piece\r\nof land for a garden or a poultry yard which went with it. Every mother\r\nat the birth of a child was presented with a pig. The plantation, which\r\nwas large and fruitful, and from which nothing but tobacco and wheat was\r\never sold, yielded vegetables, poultry, mutton, beef, bacon in lavish\r\nabundance, while the orchards and vines were equally productive.\r\n\r\nSome hundreds of the negroes of the neighborhood were members of the\r\nPresbyterian church of the whites. In the old church books may be seen\r\nto-day records of their marriages and funerals, and how (for example)\r\n\"Lovelace Brown was brought before the session for hog-stealing and\r\nsuspended for one month.\" But there were better records than this.\r\nThese Presbyterian negroes were at one time led by an eminent patriarch,\r\nUncle Abel, who deserves more than a passing notice. He had been taught\r\nto read and had been well drilled in the Shorter Catechism. But his\r\nmarriage ceremonies were always read from the Episcopal Prayer-book,\r\nevery word of which he held sacred, not to be changed or omitted to\r\nsuit any modern heresy. \"I M, take thee N,\" was the formula for Jack\r\nor Peter, Dilsey or Dicey—and \"with this ring I thee wed\" must be\r\npronounced with solemnity, ring or no ring, the latter being not at all\r\nessential.\r\n\r\nMy uncle's old family coach, punctual to the minute, swept around\r\nthe circle on the lawn every Sunday morning, with Uncle Peter proudly\r\nguiding the horses from his high perch. And high-swung was the coach,\r\nto be ascended (as we ascended our four-poster beds) by three carpeted\r\nsteps,—in the case of the carriage, folding steps, which were tucked\r\ninside after we had disposed of ourselves, with our ample hoops. There\r\nwas plenty of room inside. Pockets lined the doors, and these were\r\nfilled by my aunt with beaten biscuit and sugar-cakes \"for the little\r\ndarkies on the road.\"\r\n\r\nArriving at the church, the gentlemen from the adjacent plantations,\r\nwho had been settling the affairs of the nation under the trees, came\r\nforward to hand us from our carriage, after the manner of old-time\r\ncavaliers and sedan-chairs; and my aunt and I would be very gracious,\r\ndevoutly hoping in our hearts that my uncle and his sons would not\r\nforget a reciprocal courtesy when Mrs. Winston Henry, Mrs. Paul\r\nCarrington, and Mrs. Sarah Carrington should arrive.\r\n\r\nThe women all seated themselves on the right side of the church, while\r\nthe men, during the singing of a preliminary hymn, came in like a\r\nprocessional and took the left as their portion,—all of which (except\r\nthe advertisements on the church doors) was conducted precisely\r\naccording to the customs of Revolutionary times, when Patrick Henry and\r\nJohn Randolph, now sleeping a few miles away, were themselves (we trust)\r\nchurch-goers.\r\n\r\nChurch dinners at home were simple, but abundant,—so that if three\r\nor four carriages should arrive from distant plantations in the\r\nneighborhood, there could be welcome and refreshment for all, but on the\r\ngreat days when my uncle and aunt received the neighborhood, when the\r\nCarringtons and Patrick Henry's sons, John and Winston, came with their\r\nfamilies to spend the day, the dinner was something to be remembered.\r\nPerhaps a description verbatim from an old family servant will be better\r\nthan anything I can furnish from memory.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir! We had fine dinners in them days. The butter was moulded like\r\na temple with pillars, and a rose stuck in the top. There was a wreath\r\nof roses roun' all the dessert dishes. Viney biled the ham in cider.\r\nWe had roas' pig, biled turkey, chickens fried an' briled, spring lam',\r\nducks an' green goslin'. An' every cut-glass dish in the house was full\r\nof preserves, an' the great bowl full of ice-cream, an' floatin' island,\r\nan' tipsy-cake, an' cheese-cakes, an' green sweetmeats, an' citron. John\r\nwas bothered where to set all the dishes.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE OAKS.]\r\n\r\nOur guests would remain late, that they might have the cool evening\r\nhours for their long drives. Mr. John Henry, with his family of\r\ngifted sons and beautiful daughters, lived at Red Hill, the home of\r\nhis father, the great orator and patriot, under the trees his father\r\nhad planted and near the grave where he sleeps. Mr. Winston Henry had\r\nalso an interesting family, and lived in an old colonial house not\r\nfar away, surrounded by grounds filled in summer with pomegranates\r\nand gardenias, and with lemon and orange trees in tubs, also great\r\n_trees_ of heliotrope, and vines of jessamine—a paradise of beauty and\r\nsweetness. Rosalie Henry would bring her guitar to my uncle's and sing\r\nfor us by the hour. She was so loved, so cherished by her parents,\r\nthat they gave her a bedroom over their own, to which she ascended by a\r\nstairway from their own apartment—all that they might be near her. But\r\none morning early, pretty Rosalie changed gowns with her maid, put a\r\npail on her head, and slipped past her trusting, adoring parents to join\r\nher lover in the jessamine bower, and in a bridal robe of linsey-woolsey\r\nwas married at the next town! Then it was that my good uncle had his\r\nopportunity. The sublime teaching of forgiveness was respected from his\r\nkindly lips.\r\n\r\nIn the early summer of '61 Virginia planters were not all _d'accord_\r\non political questions; and like Agag, it behooved us to \"walk\r\ndelicately\" in conversation. One thing they would not endure. Politics\r\nwere to be kept out of the pulpit. Never had the pastor such attentive\r\ncongregations; they were watching him, keenly alive to the remotest hint\r\nor allusion to the war. His business was with the spiritual kingdom of\r\nGod. He must not interfere with Cæsar's. He found it expedient to omit\r\nfor the present the warlike aspirations of David, in which he beseeches\r\nthe Lord's attention to his enemies, and, among other things calculated\r\nto comfort and soothe his pious feelings, prays that they may be as\r\n\"stubble before the wind,\" as \"wood before fire,\" and be \"rooted forever\r\nout of the land of the living.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enemies\" were not to be alluded to in the pulpit. Nor, indeed, not\r\nyet in private! It was proper and in good taste to speak of them as\r\n\"Federals\"; but at no very distant day these same polite gentlemen\r\ncalled them \"enemies\" with a will; when scornfully disposed, they were\r\n\"Yankees,\" and when they wished to be positively insulting, \"Yanks.\"\r\n\r\nAcross the river from the Oaks was \"Mildendo,\" the home of the\r\nCarrington family. From this home went every man capable of bearing\r\narms—Fontaine, the fine young surgeon so well placed in the United\r\nStates Navy, and his brother, the grave head of the house upon whom\r\neverybody depended; and one, a cousin, leaving his bride at the altar.\r\nPatrick Henry's grandsons all enlisted. Mr. Charles Bruce left his\r\nbaronial castle on Staunton Hill near the Oaks, equipped the \"Staunton\r\nHill Artillery Company\" at his own expense, placed himself at its head\r\nand shared all its hardships. His brother, Mr. James Bruce, cut up his\r\nrich carpets and curtains for the soldiers' blankets. These were but a\r\nfew of the gallant neighbors of my uncle, who exchanged homes of luxury\r\nfor the hardships of war—all of whom probably shared General Lee's keen\r\nsorrow at the necessity forced upon Virginia to withdraw her allegiance\r\nfrom the Union.\r\n\r\nMy uncle had a son already in the cavalry service—and another,\r\nHenry, a fine young fellow of sixteen, was at Hampden-Sidney College,\r\nVirginia. Presently a letter from the latter filled the family at the\r\nOaks with—yes, anxiety—but at the same time a proud sense of how old\r\nRevolutionary \"blood will tell.\" Henry was on the march! At the first\r\ntocsin of war the students of Hampden-Sidney had rushed to arms—most\r\nof them under age; and when their president, the venerated Rev. John\r\nAtkinson, found they would go, he placed himself at their head as their\r\ncaptain. Military tactics had not been included in his theological\r\ntraining. So promptly had he responded to the call of his country he\r\nhad no opportunity to drill his young soldiers according to the rules of\r\nHardee and Jomini; but he did more for them than this. His fatherly care\r\nand his example of courage, fortitude, and faith in the cause inspired\r\nthem to bear hardships which were severe almost beyond their powers of\r\nendurance.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the inexperience of their captain, these boys, fresh\r\nfrom their college halls, were often publicly complimented as they\r\nheaded the column in the long marches over the mountains of Virginia.\r\n\r\nWhen they were called to Richmond their patriotic ardor received a\r\nshock. Governor Letcher seriously took under consideration the propriety\r\nof sending them back to school on account of their youth. A committee\r\nfrom the company waited upon him, and he was finally prevailed upon to\r\nallow them to go to the front.\r\n\r\nThey soon learned what war was—these beardless college boys, and bore\r\nthemselves gallantly in several engagements. But their military career\r\nwas brief. McClellan flanked their position at Rich Mountain, July 12,\r\n1861, and cut off every avenue of retreat. The whole command, after a\r\nsharp engagement, were made prisoners of war. For the time being the\r\nboys felt their military career to have been an inglorious failure.\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus disappointed and depressed, a Federal officer,\r\npresumably a lieutenant, visited them in the prison camp. He said he had\r\nheard so much of the boy soldiers led by their college president that\r\nhe wished to make their acquaintance.\r\n\r\nThe boys were not by way of being over anxious to receive visits from\r\ntheir victors. The officer asked, \"Why in the world are you here?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are here to _fight_!\" said they. \"What do you suppose we came for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, boys,\" said the officer, pleasantly, \"make yourselves easy. I'll\r\nsend you home to your mothers in a few days.\"\r\n\r\nThe officer was General McClellan!\r\n\r\nThe company was paroled, but was not exchanged for a year. This\r\nprolonged parole, they always thought, was due to General McClellan's\r\ninfluence in order to give them a whole year at college.\r\n\r\nThey all returned to the army after their exchange, but never as the\r\n\"Hampden-Sidney Boys.\" They never forgot the little interview with the\r\nGeneral. He won all their hearts.\r\n\r\nOur own Hampden-Sidney boy, Henry Rice, soon afterward wrote from a\r\nhospital in Richmond that he was ill with fever. My uncle ordered him\r\nhome, and I took the great family coach and Uncle Peter and went to\r\nthe depot, fourteen miles away, to fetch him. He looked so long, that\r\nI doubted whether I could bestow him in the carriage; and as he was too\r\ngood a soldier for me to suggest that he be \"doubled up,\" I entered the\r\ncarriage first, had his head and shoulders placed in my lap, then closed\r\nthe door and swung his long legs out of the window!\r\n\r\nMy uncle was a fine specimen of a Christian gentleman—always courteous,\r\nalways serene. I delighted in following him around the plantation on\r\nhorseback. When he winnowed his wheat, Uncle Moses, standing like an\r\nemperor amid the sheaves, filled the hearts of my little boys with\r\necstasy by allowing them to ride the horses that turned the great wheel.\r\nFinally the wheat was packed in bags, and we stood on the bank of the\r\nriver to see it piled into flat-bottomed boats on the way to market.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Moses appeared at the dining room door while we were\r\nat breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Moses,\" said my uncle. \"I thought you were going with\r\nthe wheat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dar ain't no wheat,\" said the old man. \"Hit's all at de bottom of the\r\nriver.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did that happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"We jest natchelly run agin a snag; when de boat turn over, hit pulled\r\nall de others down. 'Cose you know, Marster, dey was tied together, an'\r\nboat ain' got no eyes to see snags.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well—get out your chains and grappling hooks, Moses, and save all you\r\ncan. It will do to feed the chickens.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Uncle!\" I exclaimed, \"how calmly you take it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said he; \"because I've lost my crop is that any reason I\r\nshould lose my temper? Here, Pizarro, have our horses saddled. We'll\r\ngo down to the river and encourage Moses to resurrect his wheat.\"\r\n(Pizarro was John's son. John had studied with the boys of the family,\r\nand knew some history and Latin. One of the women bore the classic name\r\nof \"Lethe\"; others were \"Chloe\" and \"Daphne\"; another name, frequently\r\nrepeated, was \"Dicey\"—a survival, according to Mr. Andrew Lang, of the\r\nmyth of Orpheus and Eurydice, which was found among the Indians and the\r\nVirginia negroes of colonial times. Orpheus seems to have perished from\r\ntheir traditions, but Dicey is still a favorite name. The descendants\r\nof Lethe and Pizarro still live at the Oaks. A late achievement shows\r\ntheir progress under new conditions, the baptismal records having been\r\nenriched with \"Hazel-Kirke-Florida-Bell-Armazinda-Hodge,\" more imposing\r\nif less suggestive than the \"Homicide\" and \"Neuralgia\" of a neighboring\r\ncounty.)\r\n\r\nThis precise type of a Virginia plantation will never appear again,\r\nI imagine. I wish I could describe a plantation wedding as I saw it\r\nthat summer. But a funeral of one of the old servants was peculiarly\r\ninteresting to me. \"Aunt Matilda\" had been much loved, and when she\r\nfound herself dying, she had requested that the mistress and little\r\nchildren should attend her funeral. \"I ain' been much to church,\"\r\nshe urged, \"I couldn't leave my babies. I ain' had dat shoutin' an'\r\nhollerin' religion, but I gwine to heaven jes' de same\"—a fact of which\r\nnobody who knew Aunt Matilda could have the smallest doubt.\r\n\r\nWe had a long, warm walk behind hundreds of negroes, following the rude\r\ncoffin in slow procession through the woods, singing antiphonally as\r\nthey went one of those strange, weird hymns not to be caught by any\r\nAnglo-Saxon voice.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful and touching scene, and at the grave I longed for\r\nan artist (we had no kodaks then) to perpetuate the picture. The level\r\nrays of the sun were filtered through the green leaves of the forest,\r\nand fell gently on the dusky, pathetic faces, and on the simple coffin\r\nsurrounded by orphan children and relatives, very dignified and quiet\r\nin their grief.\r\n\r\nThe spiritual patriarch of the plantation presided. Old Uncle Abel\r\nsaid:—\r\n\r\n\"I ain' gwine keep you all long. 'Tain' no use. We can't do nothin' for\r\nSis' Tildy. All is done fer her, an' she done preach her own fune'al\r\nsermon. Her name was on dis church book here, but dat warn' nothin',\r\n'dout 'twas on de Lamb book too!\r\n\r\n\"Now whiles dey fillin' up her grave I'd like you all to sing a hymn\r\nSis' Tildy uster love, but you all know I bline in one eye, an' de sweat\r\ndone got in de other; so's I can't see to line it out, an' I dunno as\r\nany o' you all ken do it\"—and the first thing I knew, the old man had\r\npassed his well-worn book to me, and there I stood, at the foot of the\r\ngrave, \"lining out\":—\r\n\r\n     \"Asleep in Jesus, blessed sleep\r\n     From which none ever wakes to weep,\"—\r\n\r\nwords of immortal comfort to the great throng of negro mourners who\r\ncaught it up, line after line, on an air of their own, full of tears\r\nand tenderness,—a strange, weird tune no white person's voice could ever\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nAmong such scenes I passed the month of June and the early part of July,\r\nand then General Beauregard reminded us that we were at war, and had no\r\nright to make ourselves comfortable.\r\n\r\nDr. Rice, on the afternoon of the 21st, had betaken himself to his\r\naccustomed place under the trees, to escape the flies,—the pest of\r\nSouthern households in summer,—and had lain down on the grass for his\r\nafternoon nap. He suddenly called out excitedly: \"There's a battle\r\ngoing on—a fierce battle—I can hear the cannonading distinctly. Here—lie\r\ndown—you can hear it!\" \"Oh, no, no, I can't!\" I gasped. \"It may be at\r\nNorfolk.\"\r\n\r\nLike Jessie, who had heard the pibroch at the siege of Lucknow, he had\r\nheard, with his ear to the ground, the firing at Manassas. The battle\r\nof Bull Run was at its height. We found it difficult to understand that\r\nhe _could_ have heard cannonading one hundred and fifty miles away. We\r\nhad not then spoken across the ocean and been answered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nBULL RUN AND FAIR OAKS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had small faith in my uncle's wireless telegraphy, but in a short\r\ntime we had confirmation of his news.\r\n\r\nThen came the details of the first great battle of the war. \"Glorious\r\nnews!\" everybody said. A glorious triumph for the South,—an utter rout\r\nof the enemy; but my heart sank within me at the tale of blood. How\r\nabout those boys I had seen march away? What would life hold for some\r\nof the wives and mothers and sweethearts at home?\r\n\r\nWhat was glory to the gallant Colonel Bartow, lying in state at the\r\ncapitol in Richmond? Could glory dry his widow's tears or console his\r\naged mother? We gathered details of the last moments of the men who\r\nfell. It was all so strange! _Could_ it be true that these things had\r\nactually happened in Virginia?\r\n\r\nOur men, when the bodies were brought home, could tell many stories of\r\nofficers—but how about the boys in the ranks? Bartow had been unhorsed\r\nin the fight, and his aide, young Lamar, dashed across the field amid a\r\nhail of bullets to procure another mount for his Colonel. Suddenly Lamar\r\nwas seen to fall with his horse. Extricating himself, and perceiving\r\nthat his horse was shot, he started to proceed on foot; the wounded\r\nanimal tried to rise and follow. Our men saw Lamar turn in that deadly\r\nfire, stoop down, and pat the poor horse on the neck. Another volley of\r\nbullets ended the noble animal's life, and Lamar returned just in time\r\nto bear Bartow's body from the field.\r\n\r\nI grew so restless and unhappy that I turned my face homeward to\r\nPetersburg. My resolution was taken. I steadily withstood all the\r\nentreaties of my friends, and determined to follow my husband's regiment\r\nthrough the war. I did not ask his permission. I would give no trouble.\r\nI should be only a help to his sick men and his wounded. I busied myself\r\nin preparing a camp equipage—a field-stove with a rotary chimney, ticks\r\nfor bedding, to be filled with straw or hay or leaves as the case might\r\nbe, a camp chest of tin utensils, strong blankets, etc. A tent could\r\nalways be had from Major Shepard, our quartermaster. News soon came that\r\nthe Third Virginia had been ordered to Smithfield. McClellan was looking\r\ntoward the Peninsula, and Major-General Joseph E. Johnston was keeping\r\nan eye on McClellan.\r\n\r\nWhen I set forth on what my father termed my \"wild-goose chase,\" I found\r\nthe country literally alive with troops. The train on which I travelled\r\nwas switched off again and again to allow them to pass. My little boys\r\nhad the time of their lives, cheering the soldiers and picnicking at\r\nshort intervals all day.\r\n\r\nBut Smithfield would not hear of the camp outfit. The great box was\r\ntrundled away to the warehouse, and I was hospitably taken into one of\r\nthe homes of the little town.\r\n\r\nAfter a while things looked as if I would probably stay in Smithfield\r\nthe rest of my natural life. So I rented a small furnished house,\r\nbought a cow, opened an account with Mr. Britt, the grocer, also with\r\na fisherman who went out every night on Pagan Creek with a light in\r\nhis boat, drew his blanket around him and dozed, while the fat little\r\nmullets jumped in for my breakfast. Until the mullet species becomes\r\nextinct nobody need starve in Smithfield.\r\n\r\nThe Third Virginia and its Colonel were giving themselves up to murmurs\r\nand discontent at being \"buried in Smithfield\" while gallant fighting\r\nwas going on elsewhere, meanwhile studying Hardee and Jomini with\r\nall their might. Not one of the officers or men had ever before seen\r\nmilitary service. The daily drill was the only excitement.\r\n\r\nHere they were, fastened hand and foot, strong, ardent fellows, while so\r\nmuch was going on elsewhere,—Stonewall Jackson marching on his career\r\nof glory, Beauregard ordered to active service in the West, Fort Henry\r\nand Fort Donelson surrendered to the enemy, our army falling back from\r\nManassas, the mighty Army of the Potomac divided and scattered. Then\r\ncame news that General Lee, whose first appointment was from Virginia,\r\nwas to have command of all the armies of the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nMajor-General Pemberton (the gallant hero who held Vicksburg against\r\nsuch odds) was then our commanding officer at Smithfield. His wife and\r\nher sister, Miss Imogene Thompson, were our grand dames,—deserving the\r\nadmiration we accorded them. The beauty of the town was Mary Garnett;\r\nthe spirited belle who wore brass buttons and a military cap, Miss\r\nRiddick. Despite all the discouraging news, these young people mightily\r\ncheered the spirits of the officers and helped them to bear inglorious\r\ninaction with becoming fortitude.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pemberton varied our own routine somewhat by giving an\r\noccasional dinner party. Once he invited us to an early morning drive\r\nto Cooper's Point, opposite Newport News, where the warships _Congress_\r\nand _Cumberland_ were anchored, with whose guns (so soon to be silenced\r\nby the iron-clad _Merrimac_) we were already familiar. We were a merry\r\nparty, assembled in open wagons on a frosty morning, and we enjoyed the\r\ndrive with fleet horses through the keen air. Miss Imogene Thompson's\r\nlover was a prisoner of war on board one of the ships. \"Look out for\r\nthe ball and chain, Imogene!\" said the General, as we arrived in sight\r\nof the ships. Through a glass we could see the brave fellows, so soon\r\nto go down with their colors flying before the relentless _Merrimac_,\r\nbut not with pretty Imogene's lover, who lived to make her happy after\r\nthe cruel war was over.\r\n\r\nAnother event of personal interest was the presentation to the Colonel\r\nby the ladies of Petersburg of a blue silken state flag. The party\r\ncame down the river in a steamboat, and we stood on the river bank in\r\na stiff breeze while the presentation speech covered the ground of all\r\nthe possibilities in store for the Colonel, ending with, \"And, sir, if\r\nyou _should_ fall,\" and promises of tears and true faithful hearts to\r\nlove and honor him forever. In his answer of thanks he expressed all\r\nthe gratitude and chivalry of his heart, but craved sympathy for his\r\npresent state of enforced idleness—\"for the dearest sacrifice a man can\r\nmake for his country is his ambition.\"\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards he was called to Richmond to take his seat in\r\nCongress—and as there was nothing to keep him with the regiment, he left\r\nit with his Lieutenant-Colonel.\r\n\r\nBut I did not return with him. I had enlisted for the war! For some\r\nreason, which was not explained at the time, he suddenly returned,\r\nand my only knowledge of his coming was a peremptory official order to\r\nchange my base—to leave Smithfield next morning at daybreak! The orderly\r\nwho brought it stood before me as I read, and looked intensely surprised\r\nwhen I said: \"Tell the Colonel it is impossible! I can't get ready by\r\nto-morrow morning to leave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said the man, gravely, \"it is none of my business, but\r\nwhen Colonel Pryor gives an order, it is best to be a strict\r\nconstructionist.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Britt proved a tower of strength. He closed his store and brought\r\nall his force to help me. My cow was presented with my compliments to\r\nmy neighbor, Mrs. Smith, under promise of secrecy (for I knew I must\r\nnot alarm the town by my precipitate departure), my camp equipage\r\nbrought from the warehouse, my belongings all packed. As the sun rose\r\nnext morning, I greeted him from my seat on a trunk in an open wagon on\r\nmy way to Zuni, the railway station fifteen miles away. I never saw a\r\nlovelier morning. The cattle were all afield for their early breakfast\r\nof dewy grass, a thin line of smoke was ascending from the cottages on\r\nthe wayside. The mother could be seen within, preparing breakfast for\r\nthe children, who stood in the door to gaze at us as we passed. The\r\nfather was possibly away in the army, although the times were not yet so\r\nstern that every man became a conscript. These humbler folk who lived\r\nclose to the highway—what sufferings were in store for them from the\r\npillage of the common soldier! What terror and dismay for the dwellers\r\nin the broad-porticoed, many-chambered mansions beyond the long avenues\r\nof approach in the distance! I could but think of these things when I\r\nheard the boom of guns on the warships at Newport News, sounds to which\r\nmy ears had grown accustomed, but which now took on, somehow, a new\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nI soon learned that the Third Virginia Regiment moved the day after I\r\nreceived my own marching orders.\r\n\r\nMcClellan had landed about one hundred thousand efficient troops on the\r\nPeninsula for the movement upon Richmond. General Joseph E. Johnston's\r\nline of about fifty-three thousand men extended across the narrow neck\r\nof land between the York and the James. They gave McClellan battle May 5\r\nat Williamsburg, captured four hundred unwounded prisoners, ten colors,\r\nand twelve field-pieces, slept on the field of battle, and marched off\r\nthe next morning at their leisure and convenience. After this my Colonel\r\nwas brevetted Brigadier-General.\r\n\r\nThe news of his probable promotion reached me at the Exchange Hotel in\r\nRichmond, whither I had gone that I might be near headquarters, and thus\r\nlearn the earliest tidings from the Peninsula. There the Colonel joined\r\nme for one day. We read with keen interest the announcement in the\r\npapers that his name had been sent in by the president for promotion.\r\nMrs. Davis held a reception at the Spotswood Hotel on the evening\r\nfollowing this announcement, and we availed ourselves of the opportunity\r\nto make our respects to her.\r\n\r\nA crowd gathered before the Exchange to congratulate my husband, and\r\nlearning that he had gone to the Spotswood, repaired thither, and\r\nwith many shouts and cheers called him out for a speech. This was\r\nvery embarrassing, and he fled to a corner of the drawing-room and hid\r\nbehind a screen of plants. I was standing near the president, trying to\r\nhold his attention by remarks on the weather and kindred subjects of\r\na thrilling nature, when a voice from the street called out: \"Pryor!\r\n_General_ Pryor!\" I could endure the suspense no longer, and asked\r\ntremblingly, \"Is this true, Mr. President?\" Mr. Davis looked at me with\r\na benevolent smile and said, \"I have no reason, Madam, to doubt it,\r\nexcept that I saw it this morning in the papers,\" and Mrs. Davis at once\r\nsummoned the bashful Colonel: \"What are you doing lying there _perdu_\r\nbehind the geraniums? Come out and take your honors.\" The next day\r\nmy bristling eagles, which had faithfully held guard on the Colonel's\r\nuniform, retired before the risen stars of the Brigadier-General.\r\n\r\nOn May 31 \"Old Joe\" and \"Little Mac,\" as they were affectionately called\r\nby their respective commands, again confronted each other, and fought\r\nthe great two days' battle of Fair Oaks, or Seven Pines.\r\n\r\nThis battle was said to have been one of the closest, most hotly\r\ncontested, and bloody of the war. A few miles from Petersburg the\r\ncannonading could be distinctly heard, and ten or twelve of the Federal\r\nobservation balloons could be seen in the air.\r\n\r\nMcClellan had an army of one hundred thousand; Johnston had sixty-three\r\nthousand. The afternoon and night before a terrible storm had raged,\r\n\"sheets of fire, lightning, sharp and dreadful thunderclaps, were fit\r\nprecursors of the strife waged by the artillery of man.\r\n\r\n\"All night long Zeus, the lord of counsel, devised them ill with\r\nterrible thunderings. Then pale fear gat hold upon them.\"[13]\r\n\r\nThe roads were deep with mud. With many disadvantages Johnston attacked,\r\nwith vigor, the corps of Keyes and Heintzelman, drove them back, and\r\ncame near inflicting upon them a crushing defeat. Near the end of the\r\nfight General Johnston was wounded and borne from the field, smiling\r\nand saying, \"I'm not sure I am much hurt, but I fear that bit of shell\r\nmay have injured my spine.\"\r\n\r\nHe had already been wounded by a musket-ball, his enthusiasm having\r\ncarried him nearer to the fight than a commanding officer has any right\r\nto be.\r\n\r\nA little later he had observed one of his colonels trying to dodge the\r\nshell.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel,\" he said, \"there is no use dodging! When you hear them, they\r\nhave passed.\"\r\n\r\nJust then he fell unconscious into the arms of one of his couriers. A\r\nshell had exploded, striking him on the breast. The moment he regained\r\nconsciousness his unwounded hand sought his sword and pistols. They were\r\ngone!\r\n\r\n\"I would not lose my sword for ten thousand dollars,\" he exclaimed.\r\n\"My father wore it in the war of the Revolution.\" The courier—Drury L.\r\nArmstead—dashed back through the storm of artillery, found both sword\r\nand pistols, brought them safely, and received one of the pistols as a\r\ntoken of the gratitude of his chief.[14]\r\n\r\nIn General George E. Pickett's report of this hard-won battle he says,\r\n\"Pryor and Wilcox were on my right; our men moved beautifully and\r\ncarried everything before them.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Johnston was succeeded by General Lee. I did not know for a\r\nlong time (for, so absorbing were the events that rapidly followed, the\r\nhonors of battle were forgotten) that, after the capture at Fair Oaks of\r\nthe Federal brigade under General Casey, \"General Roger A. Pryor went\r\naround among the wounded, giving them whiskey and water, and told them\r\nit was a repayment of the kindness with which the wounded Confederate\r\nprisoners were treated at 'Williamsburg,'\"[15]—an incident which I hope\r\nI may be pardoned for relating, since the generous tribute affords\r\nan example of the spirit of that true Christian gentleman, General\r\nMcClellan.\r\n\r\n\"He never struck a foul blow and never tolerated mean men or mean\r\nmethods about him. His was a high ideal of war, a high sense of chivalry\r\nwhich is the duty of fighting the belligerent and sparing the weak. His\r\nconduct was keyed to the highest point of honor and generosity in war.\"\r\nWhen his march led him to the \"White House,\" whence General Washington\r\ntook his bride, Martha Custis, he ordered a guard to be placed around\r\nit; and finding himself alone in St. Peter's Church, where Washington\r\nwas married, he records in his diary, \"I could not help kneeling at the\r\nchancel and praying that I might save my country as truly as he did.\"\r\nThis was just before the battle at Seven Pines, in which there were\r\nprobably arrayed against him the near kindred of Martha Washington. What\r\nwould they have thought of the invading general's prayer to \"save the\r\ncountry\"? And _his_ country! And at the altar he held in especial homage\r\nbecause of their grandsire!\r\n\r\nLike McClellan, Johnston had not the good fortune to be in accord\r\nwith his Executive. \"Not only,\" said an Old Virginian to him as he lay\r\nsuffering from his severe wounds, \"not only do we deplore this cruel\r\naffliction upon you, General, but we feel it to be a national calamity.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" said Johnston, fiercely, rising suddenly upon his unbroken\r\nelbow. \"The shot that struck me down was the best ever fired for the\r\nSouthern Confederacy, for I possessed in no degree the confidence of\r\nthis government, and now a man who does enjoy it will succeed me, and\r\nbe able to accomplish what I never could.\"\r\n\r\nThe man who succeeded him, General Lee, wrote to the Secretary of War:\r\n\"If General Johnston was not a soldier, America never produced one.\r\nIf he was not competent to command the army, the Confederacy had no\r\none who was competent.\" But even Lee could not control the opinions of\r\nthe Executive. General Johnston was relieved from his command in 1864.\r\nGeneral McClellan's treatment, as the world knows, was hardly less\r\nsevere and quite as undeserved.\r\n\r\nRichmond heard the guns of this bloody battle. As soon as the storm\r\nallowed them, crowds of anxious listeners repaired to the hills, from\r\nwhich the cannonading and rattle of musketry could be distinctly heard.\r\nThe city waked up to a keen realization of the horrors of war. All the\r\nnext day ambulances brought in the wounded—and open wagons were laden\r\nwith the dead. Six thousand one hundred and thirty-four Confederate\r\nsoldiers had been killed; the Federal loss was five thousand and\r\nthirty-one,—eleven thousand one hundred and sixty-five brave men gone\r\nfrom the country that gave them birth!\r\n\r\nThe streets of Richmond presented a strange scene—ambulances of wounded\r\nand dying men passed companies arriving on their way to the front, and\r\neach cheered the other. Batteries of artillery thundered through the\r\nstreets; messengers and couriers ran hither and thither.\r\n\r\nThe streets were filled with a motley crowd, citizens hurrying to and\r\nfro, negroes running on messages, newsboys crying \"extras\" printed on\r\nshort slips of the yellow Confederate paper; on one side of the street\r\nregiments arriving from the far South, cheering as they passed; on the\r\nother a train of ambulances bearing the wounded, the dead, the dying.\r\nNow and then a feeble cheer answered the strong men going in to win the\r\nvictory these had failed to win, but for which they never ceased to look\r\nuntil death closed the watching eyes.\r\n\r\nEvery house was opened for the wounded. They lay on verandas, in halls,\r\nin drawing-rooms of stately mansions. Young girls and matrons stood in\r\ntheir doorways with food and fruit for the marching soldiers, and then\r\nturned to minister to the wounded men within their doors.\r\n\r\nIt has been estimated that five thousand wounded men were received in\r\nprivate houses and hospitals from the field of Seven Pines. The city\r\nwas thrilled to its centre. The city had \"no language but a cry\"! And\r\nyet there was no panic, no frantic excitement. Only that Richmond, the\r\nmirth-loving, pleasure-seeking, was changed into a city of resolute men\r\nand women, nerved to make any sacrifice for their cause.\r\n\r\nAt all times during the war the Capitol Square was a rallying place\r\nwhere men met and received news and compared chances of success. They\r\nwould sit all day on the hills outside the city and congregate in the\r\nsquare in the evening to discuss the events of the day and the probable\r\nchances for the morrow.\r\n\r\nMy news of this battle was coupled with the information that my General\r\nhad fallen ill from malarial fever, and had kept up until the army\r\napproached Richmond, but that he was now lying sick in his tent a few\r\nmiles from the city.\r\n\r\nThere I found him. It seemed strange to see the daisies growing all\r\nover the ground on which his little tent was pitched. I obtained leave\r\nto move him at once, and took him to the Spotswood Hotel in Richmond.\r\n\"He wants nothing now,\" said kind Dr. Dean, \"except some buttermilk and\r\ngood nursing.\"\r\n\r\nThe hotel was crowded. President and Mrs. Davis were there, Mrs. Joseph\r\nE. Johnston, Mrs. Myers, wife of the quartermaster-general, and many,\r\nmany more whose names are familiar in all the war histories. Everybody\r\nwas on the alert and on the _qui vive_.\r\n\r\nFrom my windows I witnessed the constant arrival of officers from every\r\ndivision of the army. The Louisiana Zouaves were an interesting company\r\nof men. Their handsome young French Colonel Coppens was a fine example\r\nof grace and manly beauty. He would dash up to the door on his handsome\r\nhorse, dismount, run up the stairs for a word with some official, run\r\ndown again, vault lightly into his saddle, and gallop down the street.\r\nNo one was more admired than Colonel Coppens.\r\n\r\nI had not visited the drawing-room often before I became aware\r\nthat a bitter feud existed between the three eminent ladies I have\r\nmentioned—indeed, the _Richmond Examiner_ gave a most amusing account\r\nof one of their spicy interviews. Jealousy and consequent heartburning\r\nhad possessed the bosoms of these ladies—do they not intrude into every\r\ncourt and camp? And here were court and camp merged into one. Had I\r\nremained idle I should probably have ranged myself on the side of my\r\n_ci-devant_ commanding officer, Mrs. Johnston; but matters of tremendous\r\nimportance soon filled every mind and heart.\r\n\r\nThis was the last reunion of old Washington friends we were to enjoy.\r\nWith some of the members of the Thirty-sixth Congress we parted at the\r\nSpotswood Hotel to meet no more on earth. Others met on the battle-field\r\nunder circumstances of which they little dreamed when the \"state of the\r\ncountry\" was under discussion.\r\n\r\nOne of the warmest secessionists was L. Q. C. Lamar. His devoted friend,\r\nGeneral Pryor, had parted with him immediately upon the secession of\r\nSouth Carolina. Their next meeting was at the battle of Williamsburg.\r\nThis battle was fought in the woods, and the danger was enhanced by\r\nthe falling boughs of the trees. Behind the shelter of a stout oak my\r\nhusband found his old friend Colonel Lamar. \"Oh, Pryor,\" he exclaimed,\r\nas the shot and shell crashed through the branches, \"what do you think\r\nnow of the right of peaceable secession?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE SEVEN DAYS' BATTLES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intense heat of June 26th has been noted in many of the diaries and\r\nrecords of the day. I remember it because I had feared its unfavorable\r\neffect upon my husband, not yet discharged by his physicians, and now\r\nlying weak and listless upon his bed at the Spotswood Hotel in Richmond.\r\n\r\nI was reading aloud to him the news in the morning papers, fanning him\r\nthe while, when a peremptory knock at the door sent me to my feet. An\r\nominous-looking note was handed in to \"Brigadier-General Pryor.\" Upon\r\nreading it, my husband slipped to the side of the bed, and reached out\r\nfor his cavalry boots. The note ran: \"Dear General, put yourself _at\r\nonce_ at the head of your brigade. In thirty-six hours it will all be\r\nover. LONGSTREET.\" Before I realized the tremendous import of the order,\r\nhe was gone.\r\n\r\nMcClellan was almost at the gates of the city. The famous \"seven days'\r\nfight\" was about to begin.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the officers of our brigade were in the hotel, and I ran out\r\nto find their wives and learn more news from them. On the stair I met\r\nColonel Scott, and as he passed me, he exclaimed, \"No time until I come\r\nback, Madam!\" Turning, he paused, raised his hand, and said solemnly,\r\n\"If I ever come back.\" The wife of Captain Poindexter came up at the\r\nmoment. She was weeping, and wringing her hands. \"Do you think,\" she\r\nsaid, \"that we could drive out to camp and see them once more before\r\nthey march?\"\r\n\r\nWe hurried into the street, found a carriage, and, urging our driver to\r\nhis utmost speed, were soon in sight of the camp.\r\n\r\nAll was hurry and confusion there. Ambulances were hitching up, troops\r\nforming in line, servants running hither and thither, horses standing\r\nto be saddled, light army wagons loading with various camp utensils.\r\n\r\nCaptain Whitner of the General's staff met me, and said, as he conducted\r\nme to my husband's tent: \"The General will be so glad to see you, Madam!\r\nHe is lying down to rest a few minutes before we move.\"\r\n\r\nHe opened his arms to me as I went in, but there were no sad words. We\r\nspoke cheerily to each other, but, unable to control myself, I soon ran\r\nout to find John and see that he had provided brandy and cold tea, the\r\nlatter a necessity lest good water should be unprocurable. Never have\r\nI seen such a number of flies! They blackened the land, corrupted the\r\nfood, and tormented the nervous horses. When I returned, Mrs. Poindexter\r\nwas standing outside the tent waiting for me. \"I can see my husband\r\nonly at the head of his company,\" she said. \"Look! they are forming the\r\nline.\"\r\n\r\nWe stood aside as the brigade formed in marching order. The stern\r\ncommand, \"Fall in! Fall in!\" reached us from company after company\r\nstretching far down the road. My husband mounted his horse, and, drawing\r\nhis sword, gave the order to advance.\r\n\r\n\"Head of column to the right!\" and with steady tramp they filed past\r\nus—past the only two women, of the many who loved them, who had known\r\nof their going and had come out to cheer and bless them.\r\n\r\nWe could not bear to remain a moment after they left. Finding our\r\ncarriage, we were about to enter, when the driver pointed back with his\r\nwhip. There, sure enough, rose the puffs of blue smoke from McClellan's\r\nguns—so near, so near!\r\n\r\nWe set our faces homeward, two stunned, tearless women, neither yet able\r\nto comfort the other. Presently the carriage stopped, and the driver,\r\ndismounting, came to the door.\r\n\r\n\"Lady,\" said he, \"there's a man lying on the roadside. We just passed\r\nhim. Maybe he's drunk, but he 'pears to me to look mighty sick.\"\r\n\r\nFanny Poindexter and I were out of the carriage in less than a minute,\r\neagerly embracing an opportunity for action—the relief for tense\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\nThe man wore the uniform of a Confederate soldier. His eyes were closed.\r\nWas he asleep? We feared the worst when we perceived a thin thread of\r\nblood trickling slowly from a wound in his throat, and staining his\r\nshirt.\r\n\r\nWe knelt beside him, and Fanny gently pressed her handkerchief upon the\r\nwound, whereupon he opened his eyes, but was unable to speak. \"What in\r\nthe world are we to do?\" said my friend. \"We can't possibly leave him\r\nhere!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can tote him to the carriage,\" said the kind-hearted driver. \"He ain'\r\nno heavy-weight, an' we can car' 'im to dat hospital jus' at de aidge\r\nof town. Come now, sir! Don't you be feared. I'll tote you like a baby.\"\r\n\r\nWe were terrified lest he should die before we reached the hospital. To\r\navoid jolting, we crawled at a snail's pace, and great was our relief\r\nwhen we drew up at the open door of the hospital and summoned a surgeon.\r\nHe ordered out a stretcher and took our patient in, and we waited\r\nin a little reception room until we could learn the verdict after an\r\nexamination of his injuries.\r\n\r\n\"It is well for him, poor fellow,\" said the surgeon upon returning\r\nto report to us, \"that you found him when you did. His wound is not\r\nserious, but he was slowly bleeding to death! Which of you pressed that\r\nhandkerchief to it?\" I had to acknowledge that my friend had rendered\r\nthis service. She was one of those nervous, teary little women who could\r\nrise to an occasion.\r\n\r\n\"He had probably been sent to the rear after he was wounded, and had\r\ntried to find General Pryor's camp,\" said the doctor. \"He missed his\r\nway, and went farther than necessary. It has all turned out right. He\r\nis able now to write his name—'Ernstorff'—so you see he is doing well.\r\nWhen you pass this way, you must call and see him.\"\r\n\r\nWe never went that way again. Two years afterward I was accosted at\r\na railway station by a handsome young officer who said he \"had never\r\nforgotten, never would forget\" me. He was Lieutenant Ernstorff!\r\n\r\nAll the afternoon the dreadful guns shook the earth and thrilled our\r\nsouls with horror. I shut myself in my darkened room. At twilight I had\r\na note from Governor Letcher, telling me a fierce battle was raging, and\r\ninviting me to come to the Governor's mansion. From the roof one might\r\nsee the flash of musket and artillery.\r\n\r\nNo! I did not wish to see the infernal fires. I preferred to watch and\r\nwait alone in my room.\r\n\r\nThe city was strangely quiet. Everybody had gone out to the hills\r\nto witness the aurora of death to which we were later to become so\r\naccustomed. As it grew dark a servant entered to light my candles, but I\r\nforbade her. Did I not mean to go to supper? I would have coffee brought\r\nto me. God only knew what news I might hear before morning. I must keep\r\nup my strength.\r\n\r\nThe night was hot and close. I sat at an open window, watching for\r\ncouriers on the street. The firing ceased about nine o'clock. Surely\r\nnow somebody would remember us and come to us.\r\n\r\nAs I leaned on the window-sill with my head on my arms, I saw two young\r\nmen walking slowly down the deserted street. They paused at a closed\r\ndoor opposite me and sat down upon the low step. Presently they chanted\r\na mournful strain in a minor key—like one of the occasional interludes\r\nof Chopin which reveal so much of dignity in sorrow. I was powerfully\r\naffected—as I always am by such music—and found myself weeping, not for\r\nmy own changed life, not for my own sorrows, but for the dear city; the\r\ndear, doomed city, so loved, so loved!\r\n\r\nA full moon was rising behind the trees in the Capitol Square. Soon the\r\ncity would be flooded with light, and then!—would the invading host come\r\nin to desecrate and destroy? How dear the city had been to me always!\r\nI could remember when I was a very little child one just such night\r\nas this. The splendor, the immensity of the city had so oppressed me,\r\ncoming, as I had come, from the quiet country, that I could not sleep.\r\nHot and fevered and afraid, I had risen from my little bed beside my\r\nsleeping mother, and had stolen to the window to look out. Like to-night\r\nthere was a solemn moon in the sky, like to-night an awful stillness\r\nin the city. Just below me a watchman had called out, \"_All's well!_\"\r\nPresently the cry was repeated at a distance—\"All's well!\" Fainter\r\nand fainter grew the echo until it became a whisper, far away in the\r\ndistant streets. The watchmen were telling me, I thought, telling all\r\nthe helpless little babies and children, all the sick people and old\r\npeople, that God was taking care of them; that \"All's well, All's well.\"\r\n\r\nAh! forever gone was the watchman, forever silent the cry. Never, never\r\nagain could all be well with us in old Virginia. Never could we stifle\r\nthe memories of this bitter hour. The watchman on the nation's tower\r\nmight, some day, mark the triumphant return of this invading host, and\r\ndeclare, \"All's well,\"—_our_ hearts would never hear. Too much blood,\r\ntoo much death, too much anguish! Our tears would never be able to wash\r\naway the memory of it all.\r\n\r\nAnd so the night wore on and I waited and watched. Before dawn a hurried\r\nfootstep brought a message from the battle-field to my door.\r\n\r\n\"The General, Madam, is safe and well. Colonel Scott has been killed.\r\nThe General has placed a guard around his body, and he will be sent here\r\nearly to-morrow. The General bids me say he will not return. The fight\r\nwill be renewed, and will continue until the enemy is driven away.\"\r\n\r\nMy resolution was taken. My children were safe with their grandmother.\r\nI would write. I would ask that every particle of my household linen,\r\nexcept a change, should be rolled into bandages, all my fine linen be\r\nsent to me for compresses, and all forwarded as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nI would enter the new hospital which had been improvised in Kent &\r\nPaine's warehouse, and would remain there as a nurse as long as the\r\narmies were fighting around Richmond.\r\n\r\nBut the courier was passing on his rounds with news for others.\r\nPresently Fanny Poindexter, in tears, knocked at my door.\r\n\r\n\"She is bearing it like a brave, Christian woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"_She!_ Who? Tell me quick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Scott. I had to tell her. She simply said, 'I shall see him once\r\nmore.' The General wrote to her from the battle-field and told her how\r\nnobly her husband died,—leading his men in the thick of the fight,—and\r\nhow he had helped to save the city.\"\r\n\r\nAlas, that the city should have needed saving! What had Mrs. Scott and\r\nher children done? Why should they suffer? Who was to blame for it all?\r\n\r\nKent & Paine's warehouse was a large, airy building, which had, I\r\nunderstood, been offered by the proprietors for a hospital immediately\r\nafter the battle of Seven Pines. McClellan's advance upon Richmond had\r\nheavily taxed the capacity of the hospitals already established.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the warehouse, early on the morning after the fight at\r\nMechanicsville, I found cots on the lower floor already occupied, and\r\nother cots in process of preparation. An aisle between the rows of\r\nnarrow beds stretched to the rear of the building. Broad stairs led to\r\na story above, where other cots were being laid.\r\n\r\nThe volunteer matron was a beautiful Baltimore woman, Mrs. Wilson. When\r\nI was presented to her as a candidate for admission, her serene eyes\r\nrested doubtfully upon me for a moment. She hesitated. Finally she said:\r\n\"The work is very exacting. There are so few of us that our nurses must\r\ndo anything and everything—make beds, wait upon anybody, and often a\r\nhalf a dozen at a time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will engage to do all that,\" I declared, and she permitted me to go\r\nto a desk at the farther end of the room and enter my name.\r\n\r\nAs I passed by the rows of occupied cots, I saw a nurse kneeling beside\r\none of them, holding a pan for a surgeon. The red stump of an amputated\r\narm was held over it. The next thing I knew I was myself lying on a\r\ncot, and a spray of cold water was falling over my face. I had fainted.\r\nOpening my eyes, I found the matron standing beside me.\r\n\r\n\"You see it is as I thought. You are unfit for this work. One of the\r\nnurses will conduct you home.\"\r\n\r\nThe nurse's assistance was declined, however. I had given trouble\r\nenough for one day, and had only interrupted those who were really worth\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nA night's vigil had been poor preparation for hospital work. I resolved\r\nI would conquer my culpable weakness. It was all very well,—these\r\nheroics in which I indulged, these paroxysms of patriotism, this\r\nadoration of the defenders of my fireside. The defender in the field\r\nhad naught to hope from me in case he should be wounded in my defence.\r\n\r\nI took myself well in hand. Why had I fainted? I thought it was because\r\nof the sickening, dead odor in the hospital, mingled with that of acids\r\nand disinfectants. Of course this would always be there—and worse, as\r\nwounded men filled the rooms. I provided myself with sal volatile and\r\nspirits of camphor,—we wore pockets in our gowns in those days,—and thus\r\narmed I presented myself again to Mrs. Wilson.\r\n\r\nShe was as kind as she was refined and intelligent. \"I will give you a\r\nplace near the door,\" she said, \"and you must run out into the air at\r\nthe first hint of faintness. You will get over it, see if you don't.\"\r\n\r\nAmbulances began to come in and unload at the door. I soon had\r\noccupation enough, and a few drops of camphor on my handkerchief tided\r\nme over the worst. The wounded men crowded in and sat patiently waiting\r\ntheir turn. One fine little fellow of fifteen unrolled a handkerchief\r\nfrom his wrist to show me his wound. \"There's a bullet in there,\" he\r\nsaid proudly. \"I'm going to have it cut out, and then go right back to\r\nthe fight. Isn't it lucky it's my left hand?\"\r\n\r\nAs the day wore on I became more and more absorbed in my work. I\r\nhad, too, the stimulus of a reproof from Miss Deborah Couch, a brisk,\r\nefficient middle-aged lady, who asked no quarter and gave none. She\r\nwas standing beside me a moment, with a bright tin pan filled with pure\r\nwater, into which I foolishly dipped a finger to see if it were warm;\r\nto learn if I would be expected to provide warm water when I should be\r\ncalled upon to assist the surgeon.\r\n\r\n\"This water, Madam, was prepared for a raw wound,\" said Miss Deborah,\r\nsternly. \"I must now make the surgeon wait until I get more.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Deborah, in advance of her time, was a germ theorist. _My_ touch\r\nevidently was contaminating.\r\n\r\nAs she charged down the aisle with a pan of water in her hand, everybody\r\nmade way. She had known of my \"fine-lady faintness,\" as she termed it,\r\nand I could see she despised me for it. She had volunteered, as all the\r\nnurses had, and she meant business. She had no patience with nonsense,\r\nand truly she was worth more than all the rest of us.\r\n\r\n\"Where can I get a little ice?\" I one day ventured of Miss Deborah.\r\n\r\n\"Find it,\" she rejoined, as she rapidly passed on; but find it I never\r\ndid. Ice was an unknown luxury until brought to us later from private\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nBut I found myself thoroughly reinstated—with surgeons, matron, and Miss\r\nDeborah—when I appeared a few days later, accompanied by a man bearing\r\na basket of clean, well-rolled bandages, with promise of more to come.\r\nThe Petersburg women had gone to work with a will upon my table-cloths,\r\nsheets, and dimity counterpanes—and even the chintz furniture covers.\r\nMy springlike green and white chintz bandages appeared on many a manly\r\narm and leg. My fine linen underwear and napkins were cut, by the sewing\r\ncircle at the Spotswood, according to the surgeon's directions, into\r\nlengths two inches wide, then folded two inches, doubling back and\r\nforth in a smaller fold each time, until they formed pointed wedges for\r\ncompresses.\r\n\r\nSuch was the sudden and overwhelming demand for such things, that but\r\nfor my own and similar donations of household linen, the wounded men\r\nwould have suffered. The war had come upon us suddenly. Many of our\r\nports were already closed, and we had no stores laid up for such an\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nThe bloody battle of Gaines's Mill soon followed—then Frazier's Farm,\r\nwithin the week, and at once the hospital was filled to overflowing.\r\nEvery night a courier brought me tidings of my husband. When I saw him\r\nat the door my heart would die within me! One morning John came in for\r\ncertain supplies. After being reassured as to his master's safety, I\r\nasked, \"Did he have a comfortable night, John?\"\r\n\r\n\"He sholy did! Marse Roger cert'nly was comfortable las' night. He slep'\r\non de field 'twixt two daid horses!\"\r\n\r\nThe women who worked in Kent & Paine's hospital never seemed to weary.\r\nAfter a while the wise matron assigned us hours, and we went on duty\r\nwith the regularity of trained nurses. My hours were from seven to seven\r\nduring the day, with the promise of night service should I be needed.\r\nEfficient, kindly colored women assisted us. Their motherly manner\r\nsoothed the prostrate soldier, whom they always addressed as \"son.\"\r\n\r\nMany fine young fellows lost their lives for want of prompt attention.\r\nThey never murmured. They would give way to those who seemed to be more\r\nseriously wounded than themselves, and the latter would recover, while\r\nfrom the slighter wounds gangrene would supervene from delay. Very few\r\nmen ever walked away from that hospital. They died, or friends found\r\nquarters for them in the homes in Richmond. None complained! Unless a\r\npoor man grew delirious, he never groaned. There was an atmosphere of\r\ngentle kindness, a suppression of emotion for the sake of others.\r\n\r\nEvery morning the Richmond ladies brought for our patients such luxuries\r\nas could be procured in that scarce time. The city was in peril, and\r\ndistant farmers feared to bring in their fruits and vegetables. One day\r\na patient-looking middle-aged man said to me, \"What would I not give\r\nfor a bowl of chicken broth like that my mother used to give me when I\r\nwas a sick boy!\" I perceived one of the angelic matrons of Richmond at\r\na distance, stooping over the cots, and found my way to her and said:\r\n\"Dear Mrs. Maben, have you a chicken? And could you send some broth\r\nto No. 39?\" She promised, and I returned with her promise to the poor\r\nwounded fellow. He shook his head. \"To-morrow will be too late,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nI had forgotten the circumstance next day, but at noon I happened\r\nto look toward cot No. 39, and there was Mrs. Maben herself. She had\r\nbrought the chicken broth in a pretty china bowl, with napkin and silver\r\nspoon, and was feeding my doubting Thomas, to his great satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIt was at this hospital, I have reason to believe, that the little\r\nstory originated, which was deemed good enough to be claimed by other\r\nhospitals, of the young girl who approached a sick man with a pan of\r\nwater in her hand and a towel over her arm.\r\n\r\n\"Mayn't I wash your face?\" said the girl, timidly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, lady, you may if you want to,\" said the man, wearily. \"It has\r\nbeen washed fourteen times this morning! It can stand another time, I\r\nreckon.\"\r\n\r\nI discovered that I had not succeeded, despite many efforts, in winning\r\nMiss Deborah. I learned that she was affronted because I had not shared\r\nmy offerings of jelly and fruit with her, for her special patients.\r\nWhenever I ventured to ask a loan from her, of a pan or a glass for\r\nwater or the little things of which we never had enough, she would\r\nreply, \"I must keep them for the nurses who understand reciprocity.\r\nReciprocity is a rule _some_ persons never seem to comprehend.\" When\r\nthis was hammered into my slow perception, I rose to the occasion.\r\nI turned over the entire contents of a basket the landlord of the\r\nSpotswood had given me to Miss Deborah, and she made my path straight\r\nbefore me ever afterward.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a week the matron had promoted me! Instead of carving the\r\nfat bacon, to be dispensed with corn bread, for the hospital dinner,\r\nor standing between two rough men to keep away the flies, or fetching\r\nwater, or spreading sheets on cots, I was assigned to regular duty with\r\none patient.\r\n\r\nThe first of these proved to be young Colonel Coppens, of my husband's\r\nbrigade. I could comfort him very little, for he was wounded past\r\nrecovery. I spoke little French, and could only try to keep him, as far\r\nas possible, from annoyance. To my great relief, place was found for\r\nhim in a private family. There he soon died—the gallant fellow I had\r\nadmired on his horse a few months before.\r\n\r\nThen I was placed beside the cot of Mr. (or Captain) Boyd of\r\nMecklenburg, and was admonished by the matron not to leave him alone.\r\nHe was the most patient sufferer in the world, gentle, courteous, always\r\nconsiderate, never complaining. I observed he often closed his eyes and\r\nsighed. \"Are you in pain, Captain?\" \"No, no,\" he would say gently. One\r\nday, when I returned from my \"rest,\" I found the matron sitting beside\r\nhim. Tears were running down her cheeks. She motioned me to take her\r\nplace, and then added, \"No, no, I will not leave him.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain's eyes were closed, and he sighed wearily at intervals.\r\nPresently he whispered slowly:—\r\n\r\n     \"There everlasting spring abides,\"\r\n\r\nthen sighed, and seemed to sleep for a moment.\r\n\r\nThe matron felt his pulse and raised a warning hand. The sick man's\r\nwhisper went on:—\r\n\r\n     \"Bright fields beyond the swelling flood\r\n     Stand—dressed—in living green.\"\r\n\r\nThe surgeon stood at the foot of the cot and shook his head. The nurses\r\ngathered around with tearful eyes. Presently in clear tones:—\r\n\r\n     \"Not Jordan's stream—nor death's cold flood\r\n     Shall fright us—from—the shore,\"\r\n\r\nand in a moment more the Christian soldier had crossed the river and\r\nlain down to rest under the trees.\r\n\r\nEach of the battles of those seven days brought a harvest of wounded\r\nto our hospital. I used to veil myself closely as I walked to and from\r\nmy hotel, that I might shut out the dreadful sights in the street,—the\r\nsquads of prisoners, and, worst of all, the open wagons in which the\r\ndead were piled. Once I _did_ see one of these dreadful wagons! In it\r\na stiff arm was raised, and shook as it was driven down the street, as\r\nthough the dead owner appealed to Heaven for vengeance; a horrible sight\r\nnever to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nAfter one of the bloody battles—I know not if it was Gaines's Mill\r\nor Frazier's Farm or Malvern Hill—a splendid young officer, Colonel\r\nBrokenborough, was taken to our hospital, shot almost to pieces. He was\r\nborne up the stairs and placed in a cot—his broken limbs in supports\r\nswinging from the ceiling. The wife of General Mahone and I were\r\npermitted to assist in nursing him. A young soldier from the camp was\r\ndetailed to help us, and a clergyman was in constant attendance, coming\r\nat night that we might rest. Our patient held a court in his corner of\r\nthe hospital. Such a dear, gallant, cheery fellow, handsome, and with\r\na grand air even as he lay prostrate! Nobody ever heard him complain.\r\nHe would welcome us in the morning with the brightest smile. His aide\r\nsaid, \"He watches the head of the stairs and calls up that look for\r\nyour benefit.\" \"Oh,\" he said one day, \"you can't guess what's going\r\nto happen! Some ladies have been here and left all these roses, and\r\ncologne, and such; and somebody has sent—champagne! We are going to have\r\na party!\"\r\n\r\nAh, but we knew he was very ill! We were bidden to watch him every\r\nminute and not be deceived by his own spirits. Mrs. Mahone spent her\r\nlife hunting for ice. My constant care was to keep his canteen—to which\r\nhe clung with affection—filled with fresh water from a spring not far\r\naway, and I learned to give it to him so well that I allowed no one to\r\nlift his head for his drink during my hours.\r\n\r\nOne day, when we were alone, I was fanning him, and thought he was\r\nasleep. He said gravely, \"Mrs. Pryor, beyond that curtain they hung\r\nup yesterday poor young Mitchell is lying! They think I don't know!\r\nBut I heard when they brought him in,—as I lie here, I listen to his\r\nbreathing. I haven't heard it now for some time. Would you mind seeing\r\nif he is all right?\"\r\n\r\nI passed behind the curtain. The young soldier was dead. His wide-open\r\neyes seemed to meet mine in mute appeal. I had never seen or touched a\r\ndead man, but I laid my hands upon his eyelids and closed them. I was\r\nstanding thus when his nurse, a young volunteer like myself, came to me.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't do that,\" she said; \"I went for the doctor. I'm so glad you\r\ncould do it.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I returned Colonel Brokenborough asked no questions and I knew that\r\nhis keen senses had already instructed him.\r\n\r\nTo be cheerful and uncomplaining was the unwritten law of our hospital.\r\nNo bad news was ever mentioned, no foreboding or anxiety. Mrs. Mahone\r\nwas one day standing beside Colonel Brokenborough when a messenger\r\nfrom the front suddenly announced that General Mahone had received\r\na flesh-wound. Commanding herself instantly, she exclaimed merrily:\r\n\"_Flesh_-wound! Now you all know that is _just impossible_.\" The General\r\nhad no flesh! He was as thin and attenuated as he was brave.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MALVERN HILL.]\r\n\r\nAs Colonel Brokenborough grew weaker I felt self-reproach that no one\r\nhad offered to write letters for him. His friend the clergyman had said\r\nto me: \"That poor boy is engaged to a lovely young girl. I wonder what\r\nis best? Would it grieve him to speak of her? You ladies have so much\r\ntact; you might bear it in mind. An opportunity might offer for you to\r\ndiscover how he feels about it.\" The next time I was alone with him I\r\nventured: \"Now, Colonel, one mustn't forget absent friends, you know,\r\neven if fair ladies do bring perfumes and roses and what not. I have\r\nsome ink and paper here. Shall I write a letter for you? Tell me what\r\nto say.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned his head and with a half-amused smile of perfect intelligence\r\nlooked at me for a long time. Then an upward look of infinite\r\ntenderness; but the message was never sent—never needed from a true\r\nheart like his.\r\n\r\nOne night I was awakened from my first sleep by a knock at my door,\r\nand a summons to \"come to Colonel Brokenborough.\" When I reached his\r\nbedside I found the surgeon, the clergyman, and the Colonel's aide. The\r\npatient was unconscious; the end was near. We sat in silence. Once, when\r\nhe stirred, I slipped my hand under his head, and put his canteen once\r\nmore to his lips. After a long time his breathing simply ceased, with no\r\nevidence of pain. We waited awhile, and then the young soldier who had\r\nbeen detailed to nurse him rose, crossed the room, and, stooping over,\r\nkissed me on my forehead, and went out to his duty in the ranks.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later I was in my room, resting after a hard day, when a\r\nhaggard officer, covered with mud and dust, entered. It was my husband.\r\n\r\n\"My men are all dead,\" he said, with anguish, and, falling across the\r\nbed, he gave vent to the passionate grief of his heart.\r\n\r\nThousands of Confederate soldiers were killed, thousands wounded.\r\n\r\nRichmond was saved!\r\n\r\nGeneral McClellan and General Lee both realized that their men needed\r\nrest. My husband was allowed a few days' respite from duty. Almost\r\nwithout pause he had fought the battles of Williamsburg, Seven Pines,\r\nMechanicsville, Gaines's Mill, and Frazier's Farm. He had won his\r\npromotion early, but he had lost the loved commander who appreciated\r\nhim, had seen old schoolmates and friends fall by his side,—the\r\ndear fellow, George Loyal Gordon, who had been his best man at our\r\nwedding,—old college comrades, valued old neighbors.\r\n\r\nOpposed to him in battle, then and after, were men who in after years\r\navowed themselves his warm friends,—General Hancock, General Slocum,\r\nGeneral Butterfield, General Sickles, General Fitz-John Porter, General\r\nMcClellan, and General Grant. They had fought loyally under opposing\r\nbanners, and from time to time, as the war went on, one and another\r\nhad been defeated; but over all, and through all, their allegiance had\r\nbeen given to a banner that has never surrendered,—the standard of the\r\nuniversal brotherhood of all true men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE WINTER OF 1861\r\n\r\n\r\nThe privilege of nursing in the hospital had been bought at a dear\r\nprice, for it was decided positively that I was to surrender, for\r\nthe present, my dream of following the army. I was remanded to the\r\nmountains, and at Charlottesville I had news of the events that rapidly\r\nfollowed the Seven Days' Battles around Richmond.\r\n\r\nMcClellan had been relieved of his command, and the defenceless women\r\nand children of Northern Virginia were handed over to the tender mercies\r\nof General Pope. McClellan wrote, August 8: \"I will strike square in\r\nthe teeth of all the infamous orders of Mr. John Pope, and forbid all\r\npillaging and stealing, and take the highest Christian ground for the\r\nconduct of the war. I will not permit this army to degenerate into a mob\r\nof thieves, nor will I return these men of mine to their families as a\r\nset of wicked and demoralized robbers.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Pope had announced his purpose (which he carried out) to subsist\r\nhis army on our country, and to hang or shoot any non-combating citizens\r\nwho might fall into his hands, in retaliation for the killing of his\r\nsoldiers. This was one of \"the infamous orders of Mr. John Pope\" to\r\nwhich General McClellan alluded; but infamy to some eyes is fame to\r\nothers. Pope superseded McClellan; but he was himself superseded after\r\nhis defeat at the hands of Lee, and McClellan reinstated.\r\n\r\nMy husband's brigade followed General Lee, fought the battle of\r\nManassas, where he captured and paroled the hospital corps, went with\r\nhim throughout the campaign, into Maryland and back, fought the battle\r\nof South Mountain and the bloody battle of Antietam (or Sharpsburg).\r\n\r\nThe histories of these battles have been given again and again by\r\nthe military commanders who conducted them. At the close of the\r\ncampaign General Lee reported that his men were in the finest possible\r\ncondition—only there were too few of them. As the Federal armies were\r\ndepleted, they could be reënforced by foreigners. As our men were lost,\r\nwe had no fresh troops to take their places.\r\n\r\nMy husband commanded Anderson's division at Antietam, General Anderson\r\nhaving been wounded. This battle is quoted, along with the battle of\r\nSeven Pines, as one of the most hotly contested of the war. Sorely\r\npressed at one time, General Pryor despatched an orderly to General\r\nLongstreet with a request for artillery. The latter tore the margin from\r\na newspaper and wrote: \"I am sending you the guns, dear General. This is\r\na hard fight and we had better all die than lose it.\" At one time during\r\nthe battle the combatants agreed upon a brief cessation, that the dead\r\nand wounded of both sides might be removed. While General Pryor waited,\r\na Federal officer approached him.\r\n\r\n\"General,\" said he, \"I have just detected one of my men in robbing the\r\nbody of one of your soldiers. I have taken his booty from him, and now\r\nconsign it to you.\"\r\n\r\nWithout examining the small bundle,—tied in a handkerchief,—my husband\r\nordered it to be properly enclosed and sent to me. The handkerchief\r\ncontained a gold watch, a pair of gold sleeve-links, a few pieces of\r\nsilver, and a strip of paper on which was written, \"Strike till the last\r\narmed foe expires,\" and signed \"A Florida patriot.\" There seemed to be\r\nno clew by which I might hope to find an inheritor for these treasures.\r\nI could only take care of them.\r\n\r\nI brought them forth one day to interest an aged relative, whose chair\r\nwas placed in a sunny window. \"I think, my dear,\" she said, \"there\r\nare pin-scratched letters on the inside of these sleeve-buttons.\" Sure\r\nenough, there were three initials, rudely made, but perfectly plain.\r\n\r\nLong afterward I met a Confederate officer from Florida who had fought\r\nat Antietam.\r\n\r\n\"Did you know any one from your state, Captain, who was killed at\r\nSharpsburg?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! yes,\" he replied, and mentioned a name corresponding exactly with\r\nthe scratched initials.\r\n\r\nThe parcel, with a letter from me, was sent to an address he gave me,\r\nand in due time I received a most touching letter of thanks from the\r\nmother of the dead soldier.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee went into winter quarters at Culpeper, and thither I\r\nrepaired to visit a kind and hospitable family, who were good enough to\r\ninvite me. In their home I spent two weeks. I had not imagined there\r\nwere so many soldiers in the world as I saw then. \"You cannot take a\r\nstep anywhere,\" said a lady, \"without treading on a soldier!\" They were\r\nin the finest spirits, notwithstanding their long marches and short\r\nrations. Thousands on thousands of Federal troops were in Virginia.\r\nThe highways of our chief rivers were closed, our railroads menaced.\r\nEverything we needed was already scarce and held at high prices. Nobody\r\nhad comforts or luxuries; nobody murmured because of such privations.\r\n\r\nWe made our host's drawing-room a camping ground, his fire our\r\ncamp-fire. Around it gathered a nightly crowd of gay young soldiers.\r\nThey wished no serious talk, these young warriors! They had a brief\r\nrespite from fatigue and sorrow, and they intended to enjoy it. They\r\nsentimentalized, however, over the tender and mournful song, \"Lorena,\"\r\nwhich even then touched a chord in every heart, and which meant so much\r\nof devotion and heartbreak two years later. For four years the daughters\r\nof the South waited for their lovers, and some, alas! waited forever.\r\n\r\n     \"It matters little now, Lorena,\r\n       The past is the eternal past,\r\n     Our heads will soon lie low, Lorena,\r\n       Life's tide is ebbing out so fast;\r\n     But there's a future—oh! thank God—\r\n       Of life this is so small a part;\r\n     'Tis dust to dust beneath the sod,\r\n       But _there_, up _there_,—'tis _heart_ to _heart_.\"\r\n\r\nWith pretty Nelly at the piano, her blue eyes raised to heaven, and Jack\r\nFleming accompanying her on her guitar, his dark eyes raised to Nelly,\r\nthe effect was overwhelming; and lest somebody should quite finish us\r\nby singing, \"Flee as a bird to the mountain,\" we would hasten to demand\r\nthe \"Bonnie Blue Flag,\" or \"Dixie,\" or the polite invitation to \"Joe\r\nHooker\" to \"come out the Wilderness,\" or, better still, a good story.\r\nThe latter call would bring many we had heard before—there are so few\r\ngood stories in the world—but we would welcome each one with applause,\r\neven if it were no better than the story of Captain —— (I can't remember\r\nthe captain's name) and his black boy \"Cæsar.\" I can only vouch for the\r\nstory, which ran thus:—\r\n\r\nThe captain, going into a skirmish one day, left his tent and its\r\ncontents in the care of the boy. \"Mayn't I go he'p de cook?\" said Cæsar,\r\nmuch desiring to place himself farther in the rear.\r\n\r\n\"Stay here, sir, and protect my property!\" sternly commanded his master.\r\n\r\nCæsar, when left alone, grew unhappy, and when straggling shot fell like\r\nhail around the tent, he incontinently fled and hid in the bushes. When\r\nhe returned, he found an angry captain indeed.\r\n\r\n\"You rascal! Didn't I leave you here to protect my property? It might\r\nhave been all stolen.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knows it, sah, I knows it! An' I did purtect yo' property, sah! I\r\nsholy did! Dem ole cloes ain' wuth nothin'! I'se feared to bresh 'em\r\nless'n I git a hole in 'em; but _dis_ property,\" laying his hand proudly\r\non his breast, \"_dis_ property is wuth fifteen hundred dollars!\"\r\n\r\nOf course so good a story was soon capped by another. One of the boys\r\nwho had been with my General at Williamsburg could tell it. A shell had\r\nentered the domain of pots and kettles and created what Domingo the cook\r\ntermed a \"clatteration.\" He at once started for the rear.\r\n\r\n\"What's de matter, Mingo?\" asked a fellow-servant, \"whar you gwine wid\r\nsuch a hurrification?\"\r\n\r\n\"I gwine to git out o' trouble—dar whar I gwine. Dar's too much powder\r\nin dem big things. Dis chile ain't gwine bu'n hisself! An' dar's dem\r\nMinnie bullets, too, comin' frew de a'r, singin': '_Whar_—is—you?\r\n_Whar_—is—you?' I ain't gwine stop an' tell 'em whar I is! I'se a\r\ntwenty-two-hundurd-dollar nigger, an' I'se gwine tek keer o' what\r\nb'longs to marster, I is.\"\r\n\r\nOf course we heard again the story of Stonewall Jackson's body-servant,\r\nwho always knew before anybody when a battle was imminent.\r\n\r\n\"The General tells you, I suppose,\" said one of the soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"Lawd, no, sir! De Gin'ral nuvver tell _me_ nothin'! I observates\r\nde 'tention of de Gin'ral dis way: co'se he prays, jest like we all,\r\nmornin' an' night; but when he gits up two, three times in a night to\r\npray, den I rubs my eye and gits up too, an' packs de haversack,—ca'se\r\nI done fine out dere's gwine to be de ole boy to pay right away.\"\r\n\r\nAmusing as were the negro stories, there were plenty of others,\r\nrevealing the peculiar characteristics of the common soldier. The\r\nsoldier from rural districts was a trial to his officers in the early\r\ndays of the war. Nothing could make him hurry. \"If he came to a stream,\r\nhe would deliberately look around for two fence-rails and put them\r\nacross, and the time consumed by a company in crossing in this way can\r\nbe imagined. If his feet hurt him, he would sit down on the roadside\r\nto tie rags around them.\" He never could be made to understand that\r\nfreedom of speech with an officer, who had been perhaps a neighbor, was\r\ndenied him; nor yet that he could not indulge in good-natured chaff or\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sentinel here?\" asked an officer, who found a sentry sitting\r\ndown and cleaning his gun, having taken it entirely to pieces.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I am a sort of sentinel, I reckon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, _I_ am a sort of officer of the day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is _that_ so? Just hold on till I get my gun together, and I will give\r\nyou a sort of a salute.\"[16]\r\n\r\nWhen a picket guard at Harper's Ferry was being detailed for duty, one\r\nof these verdant volunteers loudly protested against that manner of\r\ncarrying on war.\r\n\r\n\"What's the use of gwine out thar to keep everybody off?\" he shouted.\r\n\"We've all kem here to hev a fight with them Yankees, an' ef you sen'\r\nfellers out thar to skeer 'em off, how in thunder are we gwine to hev\r\na scrimmage?\"\r\n\r\nIn the hardest times of starvation and weariness, according to our\r\nsoldier boys, the situation would be relieved by the drollery of some\r\ngood-natured, great-hearted countryman. Officers who had an easy place,\r\nand musicians, for a similar reason, were their special targets. Rather\r\nthan be tormented, musicians would often leave the line of march and go\r\nthrough fields to avoid the running fire. \"Ah, now! give us a toot on\r\nyer old funnel,\" or, \"Brace up thar with yer blowpipe!\"\r\n\r\nThese fellows who didn't fight were all classed under the general term\r\nof \"bomb-proofs.\" One of these officers—a little man—having appeared\r\nin an enormous pair of cavalry boots, ran the gantlet of a neighboring\r\nbrigade and heard a frank opinion of himself:—\r\n\r\n\"I say, Mister, better git out'r them smokestacks! We know you're in\r\nthar 'cause we all kin see yer head stickin' out. You needn' say yer\r\n_ain't_ in thar,—'cause yer ears is workin' powerful.\"\r\n\r\nThe allusion to the celebrated long-eared animal was awful!\r\n\r\nIf a \"bomb-proof\" officer—a fellow who had a position in the rear—should\r\nhappen to be smartly dressed when cantering along near a regiment, he\r\nwould be apt to change his canter to a gallop as the men would shout\r\nand whoop:—\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _my_! Ain't he pooty? Say, Mister! whar'd ye git that biled shut?\r\nWas ye ra-a-ly born so, or was ye put together by corntrack? Sich a\r\nnice-lookin' rooster oughter git down an' scratch for a wurrum!\"\r\n\r\nEven when a brigade would pass at double-quick, going into a battle in\r\nwhich the waiting soldier expected any moment to take part, the latter\r\nwould call out:—\r\n\r\n\"What's your hurry, boys? Gwine to ketch a train?\"\r\n\r\nThey made great fun, too, of their own fears, never considering them\r\nworthy of being treated seriously, or as in any way detrimental.\r\n\r\nUnder fire at Manassas, a raw recruit was doing pretty well, when a\r\nrabbit loped across the field. Dropping his gun as he was about to\r\nshoot, he yelled, with honest pathos:—\r\n\r\n\"Go it, little cotton-tail, go it! I'm jest as skeered as you be, an'\r\nef I dar'd, I'd run too.\"\r\n\r\nA number of militia having given way under fire, their commanding\r\nofficer called out to one of the fugitives:—\r\n\r\n\"What are you running away for, you —— —— coward? You ought to be\r\nashamed of yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ain't runnin' away, Gin'ral! I'm just skeered! Them fellers over\r\nthar are shootin' bullets as big as watermillions! One of 'em went right\r\npeerst my head—right peerst;—an'—an' I wants to go home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, why didn't you shoot back, sir? You are crying like a baby.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knows it, Gin'ral—I knows it. I wish I _was_ a baby, and a gal-baby,\r\ntoo, and then I wouldn't hev been cornscripted.\"\r\n\r\nThe regiments of Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia could never pass\r\neach other without some chaffing challenge.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, North Car'lina,\" said an officer to a lanky specimen in a shabby\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Virginia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blockade on turpentine making? You all hard up? No sale for tar now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well—yes!\" was the slow rejoinder. \"We sell all our tar to Jeff Davis\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"The thunder you do! What does the President want with your tar?\"\r\n\r\n\"He puts it on the heels of Virginians to make 'em stick to the\r\nbattle-field.\"\r\n\r\nThe staff officer rode on.\r\n\r\nA good story had found its way into our lines from a Federal officer.\r\nHe was commenting upon the fact that all Southern women were intense\r\nrebels—with one exception. He had been with others marching down a\r\nwooded lane which ended in a sharp curve. As they rounded it, they\r\nsuddenly came upon a house, before which was a woman picking up chips.\r\nAs she had evidently not seen them, the officer tiptoed up to her, put\r\nhis arm around her waist, and kissed her—and stepped back to avoid the\r\nbox on the ear he knew he deserved. The woman, however, straightened\r\nherself, looked at him seriously for a moment, and said slowly, \"You'll\r\nfind me right here every mornin' a-pickin' up chips.\"\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the telling of stories of a mildly humorous nature,\r\nwith the characteristic of dialect, was a feature of the war-time,—the\r\nPresident of the United States affording a notable example. When the\r\ngravest matters were under consideration, all things were held in\r\nabeyance until the illustrative anecdote was duly presented. How Mr.\r\nSeward chafed under them we all know. The poor little stories that went\r\nthe rounds among the rank and file at the camp-fires in Virginia had\r\ntheir uses. Whatever the weariness, the discouragement, the failure\r\nof the wagons to come up with provisions, by such simple means did the\r\nbrave boys lighten their own and each others' hearts. Whenever they had\r\ncards they played; but before going into battle the camp-ground would\r\nbe strewn with them, the soldier of the rank and file always emptying\r\nhis pockets of his cards! His Testament was pocketed in their stead.\r\n\r\nIn repeating these stories around our blazing log fire, and in\r\ndescribing their marches and hard times, the brave fellows made sport\r\nof all their discomforts and of their shifts to supplement deficiencies.\r\nThey told with merriment of the times they had proudly drawn over their\r\nbruised feet boots found on the march, and had suffered such agony from\r\nthe swelling of the compressed members that they were fain to implore a\r\ncomrade to cut off the instrument of torture; of the time Mr. Giddings\r\nand his pretty daughters entertained them in Maryland, and of their\r\ndreadful embarrassment at finding they had ravenously swept the table\r\nof every biscuit, every bit of ham, every raw tomato—and had wanted, oh,\r\nso much more! And how some of them had been captured and soon released;\r\nbut while prisoners and waiting for a train, how a Federal officer had\r\ntalked most kindly to them, inquiring for old West Point comrades of\r\nhis who were on our side; and how they on their part had asked after\r\nthe welfare of Captain John Lea of Petersburg, who had been captured at\r\nWilliamsburg,—to be told by this Federal officer that Captain Lea had\r\nbeen dreadfully wounded, and while in the hospital had been nursed by\r\na young lady with whom he fell in love, and that the officer had been\r\npresent at their marriage in Williamsburg, and through his intercession\r\nand that of other old West Point comrades Captain Lea had been released.\r\nWhen the time came for parting with the courteous officer our boys had\r\nrespectfully requested his name. \"My name is Custer,\" he said. \"I do\r\nnot belong to any regiment, but am on the staff of General McClellan.\"\r\nHe was none other than the famous George A. Custer of the United States\r\ncavalry, destined to win for himself immortal renown, and to meet\r\ngallantly an early death in the fight with the Indians on the Little\r\nBig Horn River.\r\n\r\nMany of these soldier boys—\"boys\" now no longer, but \"veterans\"—were\r\nfrom Petersburg, and had stood in line on the day when Alice and Tabb\r\nand Marian and Molly and all the other girls had waited with me to\r\nsee them off. It was delightful to meet them and to hear news of the\r\nothers. Where was Will Johnson? Where was Berry Stainback? Will had\r\nbeen captured \"for no reason whatever except that he and Berry had but\r\none blanket between them, and Will had to get himself captured when he\r\nfound Berry had been, in order to continue to share the blanket, which\r\nwas in Berry's possession,\" a story which Will's friends could safely\r\ninvent for their amusement, as his known courage was beyond all doubt.\r\n\r\nGeneral \"Jeb\" Stuart was a great hero with these soldier boys, dashing\r\nas he did all over the country with his eight thousand mounted men. He\r\nwas our plumed knight—with his gold star and long feather. They never\r\nwearied of stories of his promptness, his celerity, his meteorlike\r\ndashes.\r\n\r\n\"They'll never catch him!\" said one proudly. \"They'll always reach the\r\nplace where he recently was.\"\r\n\r\n\"He reminds me of the knights of the olden time,\" said a young lady.\r\n\r\n\"The mediæval knight, my dear young lady,\" said General Johnson, \"would\r\nbe of little use in this war. He would have stood no chance with one of\r\nStuart's men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fancy him,\" said another, \"with his two hundred weight of iron on him,\r\nand as much on his big cart-horse. Imagine him, armed with a maul or a\r\nlance, a battle-axe, and six-foot pole, going into a fight at Manassas\r\nor Antietam.\"\r\n\r\n\"He would never get there,\" said the General. \"A light cavalryman of\r\nthe First Virginia would have ridden around King Arthur or Sir Launcelot\r\nhalf a dozen times while the knight was bracing himself up for action;\r\nand the Chicopee sabre would have searched out the joints under his\r\nchin, or his arm, or his sword-belt, and would have shucked him like an\r\noyster before he could get his lance in rest.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Jackson was another of their idols. Stories of his strategy, his\r\ncourage, his faith in God, his successes, filled many an hour around\r\nthe camp-fire in the hospitable Culpeper mansion.\r\n\r\nBut the chief idol of their hearts—of all our hearts—was our beloved\r\ncommander, our Bayard _sans peur et sans reproche_, General Lee.\r\nThe hand instinctively sought the cap at the mention of his name.\r\nIndignant comments were made upon the newspaper criticisms of his early\r\nmisfortunes in the western part of Virginia in the autumn of 1861,\r\nand one occasion was remembered when, his own attention having been\r\ndirected to a fierce newspaper attack, as unjust in its conclusions as\r\nit was untrue in its statements, he was asked why he silently suffered\r\nsuch unwarranted aspersions; and he had calmly replied that, while it\r\nwas very hard to bear, it was perhaps quite natural that such hasty\r\nconclusions should be announced, and that it was better not to attempt\r\na justification or defence, but to go steadily on in the discharge of\r\nduty to the best of our ability, leaving all else to the calmer judgment\r\nof the future and to a kind Providence.\r\n\r\nHappy was the private soldier who had seen General Lee, thrice happy the\r\none who had spoken to him. Of the latter, a plain countryman, having\r\nlistened to the personal incidents of his fellows, as they related\r\nvarious occasions when they had been noticed by General Lee, was fired\r\nby a desire to emulate them, and confided that he, too, had once enjoyed\r\na very interesting and gratifying interview with General Lee. Importuned\r\nto tell it, the soldier modestly hesitated, but urged by an evident\r\nincredulity on the part of his hearers, he took heart of grace and\r\nrelated as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"I was jest out of the horspittle an' was natchelly strollin' round\r\nwhen the scrimmage was goin' on, and I saw Gen'ral Lee on a little rise\r\nnot fur off. I santered closer an' closer to him, and when I saw him\r\nlook at me I says, 'Pretty warm work over thar, Gen'ral.' He give me\r\na keen look, an' says he, quiet-like: 'Where do you belong? Where's\r\nyour regiment?' An' I says, 'I'm lookin' for my regiment now—Twelfth\r\nVirginia.' 'I can help you,' says he; 'there is your regiment just going\r\ninto the fight. Hurry up an' join it.' An' I run off proud as a pigeon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you think you might get shot?\" asked his comrade.\r\n\r\n\"I suttenly did! I always thinks that. But then, thinks I, Gen'ral Lee\r\nwill be mighty sorry 'cause he knowed he sent me into danger when I was\r\nfeelin' mighty weak an' poly.\"\r\n\r\nThe incidents were many which the officers and soldiers could remember,\r\nillustrating the dear commander's peculiar traits. His aide, Colonel\r\nTaylor, has written me of one most touching incident:—\r\n\r\n\"Tidings reached General Lee, soon after his return to Virginia, of the\r\nserious illness of one of his daughters—the darling of his flock. For\r\nseveral days apprehensions were entertained that the next intelligence\r\nwould be of her death. One morning the mail was received, and the\r\nprivate letters were distributed as was the custom; but no one knew\r\nwhether any home news had been received by the General. At the usual\r\nhour he summoned me to his presence, to know if there were any matters\r\nof army routine upon which his judgment and action were desired. The\r\npapers containing a few such cases were presented to him; he reviewed,\r\nand gave his orders in regard to them. I then left him, but for some\r\ncause returned in a few moments, and with my accustomed freedom entered\r\nhis tent without announcement or ceremony, when I was startled and\r\nshocked to see him overcome with grief, an open letter in his hand. That\r\nletter contained the sad intelligence of his daughter's death.\r\n\r\n\"Scarcely less to be admired than his sublime devotion to duty,\"\r\ncontinued Colonel Taylor, \"was his remarkable self-control. General\r\nLee was naturally of a positive temperament, and of strong passions;\r\nand it is a mistake to suppose him otherwise; but he held these in\r\ncomplete subjection to his will and conscience. He was not one of\r\nthose invariably amiable men, whose temper is never ruffled; but\r\nwhen we consider the immense burden which rested upon him, and the\r\nnumberless causes for annoyance with which he had to contend, the\r\noccasional cropping out of temper which we, who were constantly near\r\nhim, witnessed, only showed how great was his habitual self-command.\r\n\r\n\"He had a great dislike to reviewing army communications; this was so\r\nthoroughly appreciated by me that I would never present a paper for his\r\naction unless it was of decided importance, and of a nature to demand\r\nhis judgment and decision. On one occasion, when an audience had not\r\nbeen asked of him for several days, it became necessary to have one.\r\nThe few papers requiring his action were submitted. He was not in a very\r\npleasant mood; something irritated him, and he manifested his ill humor\r\nby a little nervous twist or jerk of the neck and head, peculiar to\r\nhimself, accompanied by some harshness of manner. This was perceived by\r\nme, and I hastily concluded that my efforts to save him annoyance were\r\nnot appreciated. In disposing of some case of a vexatious character,\r\nmatters reached a climax; he became really worried, and, forgetting what\r\nwas due to my superior, I petulantly threw the paper down at my side\r\nand gave evident signs of anger. Then, in a perfectly calm and measured\r\ntone of voice, he said, 'Colonel Taylor, when I lose my temper, don't\r\nyou let it make you angry.'\r\n\r\n\"Was there ever a more gentle and considerate, and yet so positive,\r\nreproof? How magnanimous in the great soldier, and yet how crushing to\r\nthe subordinate! The rash and disrespectful conduct of the latter would\r\nhave justified, if it did not demand, summary treatment at the hands of\r\nthe former. Instead of this, the first man of his day and generation,\r\ngreat and glorious in his humility, condescended to occupy the same\r\nplane with his youthful subaltern, and to reason with him as an equal,\r\nfrankly acknowledging his own imperfections, but kindly reminding the\r\ninferior at the same time of his duty and his position.\" Great indeed\r\nmust be the man whom we can love all the better for his human weakness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nGUARDING THE BLACKWATER\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Pryor's brigade had been composed of regiments from Alabama,\r\nFlorida, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia. Congress having\r\nrecommended that regiments should be enlisted under officers from their\r\nown states,—in order to remedy, if possible, the disinclination to\r\nreënlist for the war,—there was a general upheaval and change throughout\r\nthe entire army during the autumn of 1862. On the 10th of November\r\nGeneral Pryor was ordered to report for duty to Major-General G. W.\r\nSmith, commanding at Richmond, Virginia, the Second, Fifth, and Eighth\r\nFlorida Regiments of his brigade being assigned to a Florida brigadier,\r\nthe Fourteenth Alabama and the Fifth North Carolina to officers from\r\ntheir respective states.\r\n\r\nOn November 2 General Longstreet had written to General Pryor: \"I\r\nunderstand that General Perry will have the Florida regiments. Please\r\nmake some suggestion as to what arrangement we may be able to make for\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly my husband consulted General Lee, and received the following\r\nletter from him, dated November 25, 1862:—\r\n\r\n     \"GENERAL: Your letter of the 23d inst. has just been received.\r\n     I regret my inability to detach from this army the two\r\n     regiments to operate on the Blackwater. As far as I am able to\r\n     judge, troops are more wanted here than there, and it might be\r\n     better to bring the troops which it is contemplated to unite\r\n     with those in question to this army. I regretted at the time\r\n     the breaking up of your former brigade, but you are aware that\r\n     the circumstances which produced it were beyond my control.\r\n     I hope it will not be long before you will be again in the\r\n     field, that the country may derive the benefit of your zeal\r\n     and activity.\"\r\n\r\nOn November 29, General Pryor was ordered by General G. W. Smith to\r\nreport to Major-General French, and was personally introduced to the\r\nlatter by the following letter:—\r\n\r\n                                       \"RICHMOND, November 29, 1862.\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR GENERAL: This will be handed you by my friend,\r\n     Brigadier-General Pryor. General Pryor's brigade in General\r\n     Lee's army was recently broken up in rearranging the brigades\r\n     by states. It is intended by the government that he shall\r\n     have a Virginia brigade as soon as one can be formed for him.\r\n     In the meanwhile, it is General Lee's desire that General\r\n     Pryor shall serve upon the Blackwater—his own section of the\r\n     country—and he directs that the two regiments of cavalry on\r\n     the Blackwater be placed under his command, etc....\r\n\r\n     \"General Pryor has already won for himself the reputation of\r\n     being one of the best, most daring, and energetic officers\r\n     in the army, highly distinguished in civil life, and one\r\n     of the most influential men in the state, especially in his\r\n     own section. He will coöperate with you thoroughly, and I am\r\n     sure will render good service to the cause and be of great\r\n     assistance to yourself.\r\n\r\n     \"I am satisfied, from what General Lee writes me, that at\r\n     present we can have no troops from his army. The impression\r\n     is, that a great battle is impending in the vicinity of\r\n     Fredericksburg. We must keep our house in order, and make the\r\n     most of the means we have and can procure from other sources\r\n     than General Lee's army.\r\n\r\n          \"Very truly yours,\r\n               \"G. W. SMITH, _Major-General_.\"\r\n\r\nA rule enforced for the common good often falls heavily upon\r\nindividuals. General Pryor grieved to lose his men, and they united\r\nin many petitions to be allowed to remain with him. He undertook the\r\nprotection of the Blackwater region with an inadequate force, in the\r\ncertain expectation that reënforcements would be sent to him.\r\n\r\nThe enemy destined to conquer us at last—the \"ravenous, hunger-starved\r\nwolf\"—already menaced us. General Longstreet had learned that corn and\r\nbacon were stored in the northeastern counties of North Carolina, and\r\nhe had sent two companies of cavalry on a foraging expedition, to the\r\nregion around Suffolk.\r\n\r\n\"The Confederate lines,\" says a historian, \"extended only to the\r\nBlackwater River on the east, where a body of Confederate troops\r\nwas stationed to keep the enemy in check.\" That body was commanded\r\nby General Pryor, now in front of a large Federal force, to keep it\r\nin check while the wagon-trains sent off corn and bacon for Lee's\r\narmy. This was accomplished by sleepless vigilance on the part of the\r\nConfederate General. The Federal forces made frequent sallies from\r\nSuffolk, but were always driven back with heavy loss. It is amusing to\r\nread of the calmness with which his commanding officers ordered him to\r\naccomplish great things with his small force.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot,\" says General Colston, \"forward your requisition for two\r\nregiments of infantry and one of cavalry: it is almost useless to\r\nmake such requisitions, for they remain unanswered. You must use every\r\npossible means to deceive the enemy as to your strength, and you must\r\n_hold the line of the Blackwater to the last extremity_.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral French writes: \"If I had any way to increase your forces, I\r\nshould do so, but I have to bow to higher authority and the necessities\r\nof the service. But you must annoy the villains all you can, and make\r\nthem uncomfortable. Give them no rest. Ambush them at every turn.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Pryor did not dream I would come to his camp at Blackwater. He\r\nsupposed I would find quarters among my friends at home, but I had now\r\nno home. Our venerable father had sent his family to the interior after\r\nthe battles around Richmond; had given up his church in Petersburg, and,\r\ncommending the women, old men, and children to the care of a successor,\r\nhad entered the army as chaplain, \"where,\" as he said, \"I can follow my\r\nown church members and comfort them in sickness, if I can do no more.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the position of our brigade was made known to me, I drew\r\nforth the box containing the camp outfit, packed a trunk or two, and\r\ntook the cars for the Blackwater. The terminus of the railroad was only\r\na few miles from our camp. The Confederate train could go no farther\r\nbecause of the enemy. The day's journey was long, for the passenger car\r\nattached to the transportation train was dependent upon the movements\r\nof the latter. The few passengers who had set forth with me in the\r\nmorning had left at various wayside stations, and I was now alone. I\r\nhad no idea where we should sleep that night. I thought I would manage\r\nit somehow—somewhere.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at twilight at the end of our journey. When I left the car\r\nmy little boys gathered around me. There was a small wooden building\r\nnear, which served for waiting-room and post-office. The only dwelling\r\nin sight was another small house, surrounded by a few bare trees. My\r\nfirst impression was that I had never before seen such an expanse of\r\ngray sky. The face of the earth was a dead, bare level, as far as the\r\neye could reach; and much, very much of it lay under water. I was in\r\nthe region of swamps, stretching on and on until they culminated in the\r\none great \"Dismal Swamp\" of the country. No sounds were to be heard,\r\nno hum of industry or lowing of cattle, but a mighty concert rose from\r\nthousands, nay, millions, of frogs.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" thought I, \"here is really a fine opportunity to be 'jolly'! Mark\r\nTapley's swamps couldn't surpass these.\" But all the railroad folk were\r\ndeparting, and the postmaster was preparing to lock his door and leave\r\nalso. I liked the looks of the little man, and ventured:—\r\n\r\n\"Can you tell me, sir, where I can get lodging to-night? I am the\r\nGeneral's wife—Mrs. Pryor—and to-morrow he will take care of me. I know\r\nhe has no place for us in camp.\"\r\n\r\nThe little man considered, and looked us over—a lady, three little boys,\r\ntrunks, and a box.\r\n\r\n\"I can take thee in myself,\" he said. \"I am just going home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, thank you, thank you. I shall need only the smallest trunk\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I can hardly make thee comfortable, as I live alone, but\r\nthee is welcome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thee\"! Oh, joy! I thought. This is a blessed little Quaker! We'll not\r\npart again! Here I rest. We soon reached his door, and he called out\r\nfor \"Charity!\"\r\n\r\nThe call was answered in person by a black girl in a short\r\nlinsey-woolsey frock which revealed her ankles and bare feet, her hair\r\ntied in innumerable little tails, sticking all over her head like a\r\nporcupine's quills. She was the most alert little creature I ever saw,\r\nnimble-footed and quick. \"Charity,\" said my host, \"have a good fire\r\nmade upstairs in the front room at once. Thee is welcome,\" he repeated,\r\nturning to me, and I followed the sable maiden up the stair.\r\n\r\n\"And so your name is Charity?\"\r\n\r\n\"Charity's meh name an' Charity's meh naycher,\" she informed me. She\r\nsoon brought in Dick with an armful of wood, and a fine, welcome fire\r\ncheered us.\r\n\r\n\"You needn' be lookin' at de baid,\" said Charity. \"I'll soon sheet it.\r\nHe's got sto's o' quilts, but I dunno as he'll s'render 'em.\"\r\n\r\nIt appeared that he would. He brought them, an armful, himself, and the\r\nbright patchwork on our two beds looked very inviting.\r\n\r\nCharity leaned against the mantel, regarding me with leisurely scrutiny,\r\nher bare feet crossed one over the other. I felt it to be the part of\r\nprudence to placate her.\r\n\r\n\"We'll unlock the trunk,\" I said,—Dick had already fetched it,—\"and I'll\r\nfind a pretty ribbon for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knowed,\" said the girl, \"you was some punkins soon's I sot eyes on\r\nyou.\" Before I was summoned to the supper of biscuit, fried bacon, and\r\ncoffee without cream, Charity had enlightened me about her employer;\r\nshe made haste to tell me he was not her master. \"I'se free, I is! Mo'n\r\ndat, he's a Quaker, an' ef you ever seen Quakers, you knows dey don'\r\nlike no slaves 'roun'. Yas'm, I'se free—an' Dick, he's a po'-white boy.\r\nMe'n him does all de wuk cep'n in hawg-killin' time, an' den de fokes\r\ncomes fum de quarters to he'p.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you lonesome?\" I asked, making conversation.\r\n\r\n\"_Dat_ I is. You see he los' his wife two mont' ago. Dese here quilts\r\nis hern. She made 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me,\" I said, \"I'm so sorry!\"\r\n\r\nBut Charity had broken down and was sobbing with her head against the\r\nmantel.\r\n\r\n\"Yas'm! I cert'nly is lonesum! She jes up an' die, an', an' de po'\r\nlittle baby daid too.\"\r\n\r\nAs I lay in bed I thought of the dear dead woman. I resolved to be\r\nnothing but a comfort to Charity and that little Quaker. I made plans\r\nfor the happiness of both. With my heart full of sympathy, full of\r\ngratitude, full of hope, I slept sweetly and long.\r\n\r\nIn the morning a message sent from the post-office through an inquirer\r\nfrom the camp brought me my General; brought, too, an invitation from\r\nmy host to make this house his headquarters, and during the day he\r\nmoved over bag and baggage. A cook was detailed from the camp, we were\r\nto furnish our own table; and our kind host looked so deeply wounded\r\nwhen we offered rent for our lodgings, that no more was said on that\r\nsubject. I had brought nothing with me except the plain contents of my\r\ncamp chest. The thick white china of the table was unattractive, and I\r\nconsulted Charity about the possibility of buying something better. Our\r\nonly market-town, Suffolk, was in the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"He's got painted cups an' saucers, but I dunno's he'll s'render 'em,\"\r\nsaid Charity.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you ask him!\"\r\n\r\n\"I dun try 'im once. I ax 'im dat time when his mother-in-law cum to\r\nsee 'im—an' he nuvver say nuthin! Den I let 'im rip!\"\r\n\r\nBut after a few days \"he\" threw in my lap a bunch of keys, saying\r\nsimply, \"Everything in the house and on the plantation belongs to thee.\"\r\nSome of them were enormous, like the key of the Bastile, and all were\r\nrusted. I selected a small one, returning the rest, and in Charity's\r\npresence unlocked the old mahogany sideboard and counted to her the\r\ncups, saucers, and plates, gilt-edged, and decorated with a rosebud here\r\nand there.\r\n\r\n\"Good Gawd!\" said Charity. \"I _nuvver_ thought he'd s'render the chany\r\ncups!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not one is to be broken,\" I said, sternly. \"If you break one, tell me\r\nat once and bring me the pieces, so I can send to Richmond and replace\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nI saw but little of my kind host. He lived at the post-office, remaining\r\nlate every night to open the mail and have it ready for an early morning\r\ndelivery to the camp, and returning home at twelve o'clock to sleep.\r\nEvery night thereafter he found a bright fire, a clean-swept hearth,\r\nand on plates before the fire, biscuits, sausage or broiled ham, and\r\na little pot of coffee. A table—with a lamp and the latest papers—was\r\ndrawn up beside his arm-chair.\r\n\r\nA few months after I left his house for Petersburg I received the\r\nfollowing letter from him:—\r\n\r\n     \"RESPECTED FRIEND: I have now married. I couldn't stand it.\r\n\r\n          \"Thy friend,\r\n               \"I. P.\"\r\n\r\nSince then I have always counselled, as cure for an incorrigible\r\nbachelor, simply to take care of him beautifully for three months and\r\nthen—leave him!\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HON. ROGER A. PRYOR.\r\n   _From a photograph, about 1870._]\r\n\r\nBut to return: Charity's example was contagious. \"I cert'nly was\r\nlonesum\" on the Blackwater. The General and his staff were forever\r\nin the saddle. When he returned after his skirmishes and exploring\r\nexpeditions, he was too tired to amuse me. I busied myself teaching the\r\nlittle boys and dispensing the provisions our men brought me. Bacon and\r\nbiscuit, without butter, fruit, or milk, was deadly diet for me, so I\r\nwas allowed an occasional courier from the camp to take my money and\r\nscour the country for better fare. When he appeared, galloping down\r\nthe lane, on his return, he looked like some extraordinary feathered\r\ncreature with a horse's head, so completely were both covered with\r\nturkeys, ducks, geese, and chickens. Then would ensue a gift to the camp\r\nhospital of soups and stews and a fine supper for my General's staff,\r\nMajor Shepard, Captain Whitner, Major Keiley, and Captain McCann, with\r\nas many choice spirits from the officers as we could entertain. Then was\r\nbrewed, by the majors and captains aforesaid, a mighty bowl of egg-nog,\r\nsweet and very stiff, for there was no milk to temper its strength. I\r\nfeared at first that my Quaker host might disapprove, but I never failed\r\nto find the foaming glass I placed beside his night lamp quite empty\r\nnext morning.\r\n\r\nI could manage to occupy myself during the day. I could make a study\r\nof Charity, in whom I soon perceived quite an interesting character,\r\nquick to learn, responsive, and most affectionate. She was literally my\r\nonly female companion. I had no neighbors, nowhere to drive (the enemy\r\nwas only fifteen miles off) except on the watery lanes, nothing to\r\nmeet when driving except, perhaps, a slow-moving cart drawn by steeds\r\nlike Sydney Smith's \"Tug-and-Lug, Haul-and-Crawl,\" driven by a negro\r\nboy, who stood with feet planted on the shafts and who entertained his\r\npatient, long-suffering oxen by telling them of the torments awaiting\r\nthem unless they would \"go along.\" But the long and lonely evenings\r\nwere hard to bear, when the general and his staff were abroad, roaming\r\nlike watch-dogs around the frontier, deluding the enemy by a great show\r\nof bravado here and there. Nothing like the orchestra of frogs can be\r\nimagined. They serenaded the moon all night long; a magnificent diapason\r\nof mighty voices, high soprano, full baritone, and heavy bass. I could\r\nunderstand the desperate need of the lone woman who had once lived here.\r\nThe patchwork quilts were eloquent witnesses.\r\n\r\nAs the time dragged on in this lonely place, I began to find that I\r\nwanted many articles classed in a woman's mind generally as \"things.\"\r\n\r\nThere is not a more generous word in the English language than \"things.\"\r\nIt may mean, according to Stormonth, \"A Swedish assize of justice,\r\na Norwegian parliament, a meeting for palaver on public affairs,\r\nluggage, or clothes,\"—which proves how important is the making of\r\nnew dictionaries as we travel along toward our highest civilization.\r\nFor instance: when you say to your butler, \"Be careful with the\r\nbreakfast things,\" he understands you perfectly. He knows you mean the\r\negg-shell cups, and blossomy plates. When you bid your maid bring your\r\n\"things,\" she appears with your hat, gloves, cloak, and furs. \"Her\r\nrooms are comfortable, but I don't like her things,\" you say when the\r\n_bric-à-brac_ and curios are not to your taste. \"I never speak of such\r\nthings,\" you declare in haughty superiority when some guest has filled\r\nan hour with foolish or injurious gossip. \"Such things are beneath\r\ncontempt,\" says the lawyer of certain practices familiar in the courts.\r\nAnd then we have \"poor thing,\"—not the traditional robin who \"hides his\r\nhead under his wing, poor thing,\" but some fine lady, far from young\r\nand—unmarried! And \"a poor thing, sir, but mine own,\"—this time not a\r\nfine lady by any means, only \"an ill-favored virgin.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, having vexed our souls all the week over mundane \"things,\" we\r\nare given, on Sunday, glimpses of another world quite as full of them.\r\n\r\n\"Wean yourselves from earthly idols and fix your hearts on heavenly\r\nthings,\" says the bishop. Things! Heavenly things! Stars, harps, crowns\r\nof righteousness, high and lofty aspirations!\r\n\r\nNot long after the battle of Fredericksburg a participator described\r\nthe panic, the horror, the fleeing of the women and children from their\r\nhomes. \"And then,\" he said, \"there arose from that homeless, stricken\r\ncrowd of women a cry of mortal agony, '_My things! Oh, my things!_'\"\r\n\r\n\"Things\" to me meant only needful garments. I could starve with perfect\r\nserenity. I could live without the latest novel, the late magazines,\r\negg-shell china, rich attire, jewels; but I had not had a new bonnet\r\nfor three years. Shoes, and above all shoestrings, were needed by my\r\nlittle boys, needles, tapes, sewing thread and sewing silk, stays and\r\nstaylaces, gloves, combs. Of course I needed garments of muslin and\r\nlinen. Had I not rolled bandages of mine? I needed gowns. A calico dress\r\nnow cost $40. But these large \"things\" were quite beyond all hope on the\r\nBlackwater. Smaller articles I might, perhaps, compass. The General's\r\norders, however, strictly forbade the purchase by private individuals\r\nof articles smuggled through the lines. He once confiscated a sloop on\r\nthe Blackwater laden with women's shoes, slippers, and Congress gaiters!\r\nHe would not allow me a shoe; all were sent to Richmond to be sold for\r\nthe benefit of the government. Communication with the enemy must be\r\ndiscouraged lest he discover our weakness.\r\n\r\nI knew that most of the tight little carts peddling fish, potatoes,\r\nand eggs had double bottoms between which were all sorts of delightful\r\nthings, but I never dared approach the pedler on the subject; and as I\r\nwas the commanding officer's wife, he dared not approach me.\r\n\r\nOne day I was in an ambulance, driving on one of the interminable lanes\r\nof the region, the only incident being the watery crossing over the\r\n\"cosin,\" as the driver called the swamps that had been \"Poquosin\" in\r\nthe Indian tongue. Behind me came a jolting two-wheeled cart, drawn\r\nby a mule and driven by a small negro boy, who stood in front with a\r\nfoot planted firmly upon each of the shafts. Within, and completely\r\nfilling the vehicle, which was nothing more than a box on wheels, sat\r\na dignified-looking woman. The dame of the ambulance at once became\r\nfascinated by a small basket of sweet potatoes which the dame of the\r\ncart carried in her lap.\r\n\r\nWith a view to acquiring these treasures I essayed a tentative\r\nconversation upon the weather, the prospects of a late spring, and\r\nfinally the scarcity of provisions and consequent suffering of the\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nAfter a keen glance of scrutiny the market woman exclaimed, \"Well, I am\r\ndoing all I can for them! I know you won't speak of it! Look here!\"\r\n\r\nLifting the edge of her hooped petticoat, she revealed a roll of army\r\ncloth, several pairs of cavalry boots, a roll of crimson flannel,\r\npackages of gilt braid and sewing silk, cans of preserved meats, a bag\r\nof coffee! She was on her way to our own camp, right under the General's\r\nnose! Of course I should not betray her—I promised. I did more. Before\r\nwe parted she had drawn forth a little memorandum book and had taken a\r\nlist of my own necessities. She did not \"run the blockade\" herself. She\r\nhad an agent—\"a dear, good Suffolk man\"—who would fill my order on his\r\nnext trip.\r\n\r\nIt isn't worth while to tell men everything. They are not supposed to\r\nbe interested in the needle-and-thread ways of women!\r\n\r\nAbout three weeks after my interview with the blockade-runner, I was\r\ndriving again in the ambulance. Suddenly Captain Whitner, who had\r\ngalloped to overtake me, wheeled in front of the horses and stopped\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Captain! Any news at camp I am permitted to learn?\"\r\n\r\nI perceived the corners of his mouth twitching, but he said gravely:—\r\n\r\n\"I am commissioned to tell you that you must consider yourself under\r\narrest. I am sent to discharge this painful duty and conduct you to\r\ncamp.\"\r\n\r\n\"By whose order, pray?\"\r\n\r\n\"Official orders from headquarters,\" and he presented a paper.\r\n\r\nI knew he must be acting a part for his own amusement, and I asked no\r\nquestions. I would not gratify him by seeming to be alarmed.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at my husband's tent, I found him with Major Shepard,\r\nand a wretched-looking countryman standing near them. I comprehended\r\nthe situation at a glance and resolved to play my part.\r\n\r\n\"This prisoner,\" said the General, \"has been arrested for bringing in\r\ncontraband goods in violation of express orders. He pleads that the\r\ngoods were ordered by the General's wife for the use of the General's\r\nfamily. Have you anything to say to show cause why he should not be\r\npunished?\"\r\n\r\n\"May it please the court,\" I said, turning to Major Shepard and Captain\r\nWhitner, \"I call you to witness that I invited you last week to partake\r\nof a bowl of egg-nog, telling you it was made of contraband French\r\nbrandy. When the commanding officer's attention was called to the fact,\r\nhe said he could do nothing; he was obliged to submit because I was his\r\nsuperior officer, that I outranked him everywhere except on the march\r\nand the battle-field.\"\r\n\r\nA burst of laughter interrupted me. The chairman called for order.\r\n\r\n\"I confess that I deputed this estimable gentleman to procure some\r\nsewing silk for the mending of the garments of my subordinate officer.\r\nI had hoped that through his valor the blockade would, ere this, have\r\nbeen raised. Finding myself mistaken—\"\r\n\r\n\"The prisoner is discharged,\" said the General,—I uttered an exclamation\r\nof triumph,—\"but,\" he added, \"the goods are confiscated for the benefit\r\nof the Confederate government, and are already on the way to Richmond.\"\r\n\r\nI was very sorry for the fright the poor man had suffered for my sake.\r\nI took him home with me beside the driver on the ambulance. Of course\r\nI paid him. I had one piece of family silver with me for which I had no\r\nuse on the Blackwater,—a butter knife—and I gave it to him as a souvenir\r\nof his happy escape from danger.\r\n\r\nHow did I manage without my needles and thread?\r\n\r\nCharity came to me early one morning with a brown paper parcel in her\r\narms.\r\n\r\n\"Dat ole creeter,\" said Charity, \"what come home wid you las' week,\r\nknock at de kitchen do' fo' day dis mornin'. He gimme dis, an' say you\r\nbleeged to git it fo' de Gen'al wake up; an'—an'—he say—but Lawd! 'tain'\r\nwuf while to tell you what he say! But he _do_ say to tell you to gimme\r\nsumpin out'n de bundle. Gawd knows I ain' no cravin' po'-white-folks'\r\nnigger, but dat what he say.\"\r\n\r\nI need not give an inventory of the contents of the bundle. They were\r\nperfectly satisfactory to me—and to Charity.\r\n\r\nWe had slender mails on the Blackwater, few papers, no books.\r\nOccasionally a letter from Agnes gave me news of the outside world.\r\n\r\n                                    \"RICHMOND, January 7, 1863.\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEARIE: Have you no pen, ink, and paper on the\r\n     Blackwater—the very name of which suggests ink?

I am sending you to-day a copy of Victor\r\n     Hugo's last novel, \"Les Misérables,\" reprinted by a Charleston\r\n     firm on the best paper they could get, poor fellows, pretty\r\n     bad I must acknowledge. You'll go wild over that book—I\r\n     did—and everybody does.\r\n\r\n     \"Major Shepard must order some copies for the brigade. As he\r\n     has plenty of meat and bread now, he can afford it.

They calmly walk into the\r\n     bookstores, poor dear fellows, and ask for \"Lee's Miserables\r\n     faintin'!\"—the first volume being \"Fantine.\" I've worlds of\r\n     news to tell you.

He was such a\r\n     lovely fellow—engaged to Sue Bland—I never saw a handsomer\r\n     pair. Well, Sue thinks as much as I do about good looks, and\r\n     Jim wrote to release her. She had a good cry, and finally came\r\n     down to Richmond, married him, and took him home to nurse him.\r\n\r\n     \"Do you realize the fact that we shall soon be without a\r\n     stitch of clothes?

We have no right\r\n     at this time to dress better than our neighbors, and besides,\r\n     the soldiers need every cent of our money. Do you remember\r\n     in Washington my pearl-gray silk bonnet, trimmed inside with\r\n     lilies of the valley? I have ripped it up, washed and ironed\r\n     it, dyed the lilies blue (they are bluebells now), and it\r\n     is very becoming.

A Northern writer\r\nhas recorded an interview with a negro who had run the blockade and\r\nentered the service of a Federal officer. He was met on board a steamer,\r\nafter the battle of Fort Donelson, on his way to a new situation, and\r\nquestioned in regard to his experience of war.[17]\r\n\r\n\"Were you in the fight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Had a little taste of it, sah.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stood your ground, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sah! I run.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at the first fire?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sah, an' would a' run sooner ef I knowed it was a-comin'!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that wasn't very creditable to your courage, was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dat ain't in my line, sah—cookin's my perfeshun.\"\r\n\r\n\"But have you no regard for your reputation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Refutation's nothin' by de side o' life.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you don't consider your life worth more than other people's, do\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hit's wuth mo' to me, sah.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you must value it very highly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yas, sah, I does,—mo'n all dis wuld! Mo' dan a million o' dollars,\r\nsah. What would dat be wuth to a man wid de bref out o' 'im?\r\nSelf-perserbashun is de fust law wid me, sah!\"\r\n\r\n\"But why should you act upon a different rule from other men?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Cause diffunt man set diffunt value 'pon his life. Mine ain't in de\r\nmarket.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if all soldiers were like you, traitors might have broken up the\r\ngovernment without resistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dat's so! Dar wouldn't 'a' been no hep fer it. But I don' put my life\r\nin de scale against no gubberment on dis yearth. No gubberment gwine\r\npay me ef I loss messef.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, do you think you would have been much missed if you had been\r\nkilled?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe not, sah! A daid white man ain' much use to dese yere sogers,\r\nlet alone a daid niggah, but I'd 'a' missed mysef powerful, an' dat's\r\nde pint wid me.\"\r\n\r\nTowards the last of January we had a season of warm, humid weather.\r\nApparently the winter was over; the grass was springing on the swamp,\r\ngreen and luxurious, and the willows swelling into bud. There were no\r\nsinging birds on the Blackwater as early as January 28, but the frogs\r\nwere mightily exercised upon the coming of spring, and their nightly\r\nconcerts took on a jubilant note.\r\n\r\nOne day I had a few moments' conversation with my husband about army\r\naffairs, and he remarked that our Southern soldiers were always restless\r\nunless they were in action. \"They never can stand still in battle,\" he\r\nsaid; \"they are willing to yell and charge the most desperate positions,\r\nbut if they can't move forward, they must move backward. Stand still\r\nthey cannot.\"\r\n\r\nI thought I could perceive symptoms of restlessness on the part of their\r\ncommander. Often in the middle of the night he would summon John, mount\r\nhim, and send him to camp, a short distance away; and presently I would\r\nhear the tramp, tramp of the General's staff officers, coming to hold\r\na council of war in his bedroom. On the 28th of January he confided to\r\nme that on the next day he would make a sally in the direction of the\r\nenemy. \"He is getting entirely too impudent,\" said he; \"I'm not strong\r\nenough to drive him out of the country, but he must keep his place.\"\r\n\r\nI had just received a present of coffee. This was at once roasted and\r\nground. On the day of the march, fires were kindled under the great\r\npots used at the \"hog-killing time\" (an era in the household) and many\r\ngallons of coffee were prepared. This was sweetened, and when our men\r\npaused near the house to form the line of march, the servants and little\r\nboys passed down the line with buckets of the steaming coffee, cups,\r\ndippers, and gourds. Every soldier had a good draught of comfort and\r\ncheer. The weather had suddenly changed. The great snow-storm that fell\r\nin a few days was gathering, the skies were lowering, and the horizon\r\nwas dark and threatening.\r\n\r\nAfter the men had marched away, I drove to the hospital tent and\r\nput myself at the disposal of the surgeon. We inspected the store of\r\nbandages and lint, and I was intrusted with the preparation of more.\r\n\r\n\"I ain' got no use for dis stuff,\" said my one female friend and\r\ncompanion, Charity, whom I pressed into service to help me pick lint.\r\n\"'Pears like 'tain't good for nuthin' but to line a bird's nes'.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be soft for the wound of a soldier,\" I said, \"after he has\r\nfought the Yankees.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll pick den; I'll tar up my onlies' apun ef he'll kill one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Charity!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yas'm, I will dat! Huccome we all don' drive 'm out o' Suffolk? Der's\r\nlodes an lodes o' shoes an' stockin's, an' sugar an' cawfy in Suffolk!\r\nAn' dese nasty Abolition Yankees got 'em all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Those are not proper words for you to use,\" I said. \"What have you\r\nagainst the Northern people? They never did you harm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dey ain't, ain't dey?\" she replied, with feeling. \"Huccome I'se got to\r\ngo barfooted? Hit's scan'lous for a free gal to go barfooted, like she\r\nwas so no 'count she couldn't git a par o' shoes fer herse'f.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll ask the General to order a pair for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" said Charity, scornfully; \"you can't do nothin' wid dat Gen'al.\r\nAin' I hear you baig an' baig 'im for a par o' slippers dat time he\r\nfristricated de boatload full? I ain' seen you git de slippers.\"\r\n\r\nCharity was not the only one of the Nation's Wards who held the enemy\r\nin contempt. The special terms in which she designated them were in\r\ncommon use at the time. She had often heard them from the General's\r\nservant, John, who shared the opinions of the common soldier. Some\r\nof the expressions of the great men I knew in Washington were quite\r\nas offensive and not a bit less inelegant, although framed in better\r\nEnglish. I never approved of \"calling names,\" I had seen what comes of\r\nit; and I reproved John for teaching them to my little boys.\r\n\r\n\"No'm,\" said John, \"I won't say nothin'; I'll just say the Yankees are\r\nmighty mean folks.\"\r\n\r\nMy first news from the General was cheering, but he would not return\r\nfor a day or two. He must fly about the frontier a little in various\r\ndirections to let the enemy know he was holding his own. His official\r\nreport was as follows:—\r\n\r\n     \"TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL COLSTON, Petersburg, Va.\r\n          \"CARRSVILLE, ISLE OF WIGHT, January 30, 1863.\r\n\r\n     \"GENERAL: This morning at 4 o'clock the enemy under\r\n     Major-General Peck attacked me at Kelly's store, eight\r\n     miles from Suffolk. After three hours' severe fighting we\r\n     repulsed them at all points and held the field. Their force\r\n     is represented by prisoners to be between ten and fifteen\r\n     thousand. My loss in killed and wounded will not exceed\r\n     fifty—no prisoners. I regret that Col. Poage is among the\r\n     killed. We inflicted a heavy loss on the enemy.\r\n\r\n          \"Respectfully,\r\n               \"ROGER A. PRYOR, _Brigadier-General Commanding_.\"\r\n\r\nOn February 2 the General thus addressed his troops: \"The\r\nBrigadier-General congratulates the troops of this command on the\r\nresults of the recent combat.\r\n\r\n\"The enemy endeavored under cover of night to steal an inglorious\r\nvictory by surprise, but he found us prepared at every point, and\r\ndespite his superior numbers, greater than your own, in the proportion\r\nof five to one, he was signally repulsed and compelled to leave us in\r\npossession of the field.\r\n\r\n\"After silencing his guns and dispersing his infantry, you remained\r\non the field from night until one o'clock, awaiting the renewal of the\r\nattack, but he did not again venture to encounter your terrible fire.\r\n\r\n\"When the disparity of force between the parties is considered, with\r\nthe proximity of the enemy to his stronghold, and his facilities of\r\nreënforcements by railway, the result of the action of the 30th will be\r\naccepted as a splendid illustration of your courage and good conduct.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the \"enemy's\" papers declared that our force was \"three regiments\r\nof infantry, fourteen pieces of artillery, and about nine hundred\r\ncavalry.\"\r\n\r\nThe temptation to \"lie under a mistake\" was great in those days of\r\npossible disaffection, when soldiers had to believe in their cause in\r\norder to defend it. One of the newspaper correspondents of the enemy\r\nexplained why we were not again attacked after the first fight. He\r\nsaid: \"Some may inquire why we did not march forthwith to Carrsville and\r\nattack the rebels again. The reasons are obvious. Had he went [_sic_] to\r\nCarrsville Pryor would have had the advantage to cut off our retreat.\r\nThe natives know every bypath and blind road through the woods and are\r\never ready to help the rebels to our detriment. Pryor can always cross\r\nthe Blackwater on his floating bridge. It is prudent to allow an enemy\r\nto get well away from his stronghold the better to capture his guns and\r\ndestroy his ammunition,\" etc.\r\n\r\nAnother paper declares he was heavily reënforced at Carrsville.\r\n\r\nAnother records: \"The rebels have been very bold in this neighborhood.\r\nPryor has been in the habit of crossing the Blackwater River whenever\r\nhe wanted to. Our attacking him this time must have been a real surprise\r\nto him. We took a large number of prisoners!\"\r\n\r\nHe continued the indulgence of this habit until spring, receiving from\r\nhis countrymen unstinted praise for his protection of that part of our\r\nstate. While he could not utterly rout the invading army, he \"held them\r\nvery uneasy.\"\r\n\r\nI was made rich by enthusiastic congratulations from our capital and\r\nfrom Petersburg. Agnes wrote from Richmond:—\r\n\r\n     \"Have you seen the _Enquirer_? Of course this is very\r\n     grand for you because this is your own little fight—all by\r\n     yourself. In Richmond everybody says the General is to be\r\n     promoted Major-General. When he is, I shall attach myself\r\n     permanently to his staff. The life of inglorious idleness\r\n     here is perfectly awful. If you suppose I don't long for a\r\n     rich experience, you are mistaken. Give me the _whole_ of\r\n     it—victory, defeat, glory and misfortune, praise and even\r\n     censure (so it be _en plein air_)—anything, everything, except\r\n     stolid, purposeless, hopeless uselessness.\r\n\r\n     \"The worst effect of this inaction is felt in this city, where\r\n     we can manufacture nothing for the soldiers, and only consume\r\n     in idleness what they need. A sort of court is still kept up\r\n     here—but the wives of our great generals are conspicuous for\r\n     their absence. Mrs. Lee is never seen at receptions. She and\r\n     her daughters spend their time knitting and sewing for the\r\n     soldiers, just as her great-grandmother, Martha Washington,\r\n     did in '76; and General Lee writes that these things are\r\n     needed. People here, having abundant time to find fault, do\r\n     not hesitate to say that our court ladies assume too much\r\n     state for revolutionary times. They had better be careful!\r\n     We won't guillotine them—at least not on the block (there\r\n     are other guillotines), but it would be lovelier if they\r\n     could realize their fine opportunities. Think of Florence\r\n     Nightingale! Mrs. Davis is very chary of the time she allots\r\n     us. If King Solomon were to call with the Queen of Sheba on\r\n     his arm the fraction of a moment after the closing minute of\r\n     her reception, he would not be admitted! I can just see you\r\n     saying, in that superior manner you see fit to assume with\r\n     me:—\r\n\r\n     \"'But, Agnes dear! that is good form, you know, and belongs\r\n     to the etiquette of polite life.'\r\n\r\n     \"Of course I know it! Did I say that Mrs. Davis should admit\r\n     King Solomon? _I_ wouldn't! I only tell you what other folks\r\n     think and say—but _ajew_, until I hear some more news and\r\n     gossip.\r\n\r\n          \"Dearly again,\r\n               \"Agnes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nVICISSITUDES OF THE WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nMy friend Agnes could soon record graver things than idleness or gossip.\r\nOn April 4, 1863, she wrote from Richmond:—\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR: I hope you appreciate the fact that you are herewith\r\n     honored with a letter written in royal-red ink upon sumptuous\r\n     gilt-edged paper. There is not, at the present writing, one\r\n     inch of paper for sale in the capital of the Confederacy,\r\n     at all within the humble means of the wife of a Confederate\r\n     officer. Well is it for her—and I hope for you—that her\r\n     youthful admirers were few, and so her gorgeous cream-and-gold\r\n     album was only half filled with tender effusions. Out come\r\n     the blank leaves, to be divided between her friend and her\r\n     Colonel. Don't be alarmed at the color of the writing. I have\r\n     not yet dipped my goose-quill (there are no steel pens) in\r\n     the 'ruddy drops that visit my sad heart,' nor yet into good\r\n     orthodox red ink. There are fine oaks in the country, and that\r\n     noble tree bears a gall-nut filled with crimson sap. One lies\r\n     on my table, and into its sanguinary heart I plunge my pen.\r\n\r\n     \"Something very sad has just happened in Richmond—something\r\n     that makes me ashamed of all my jeremiads over the loss of the\r\n     petty comforts and conveniences of life—hats, bonnets, gowns,\r\n     stationery, books, magazines, dainty food. Since the weather\r\n     has been so pleasant, I have been in the habit of walking in\r\n     the Capitol Square before breakfast every morning. Somehow\r\n     nothing so sets me up after a restless night as a glimpse of\r\n     the dandelions waking up from their dewy bed and the songs\r\n     of the birds in the Park. Yesterday, upon arriving, I found\r\n     within the gates a crowd of women and boys—several hundreds of\r\n     them, standing quietly together. I sat on a bench near, and\r\n     one of the number left the rest and took the seat beside me.\r\n     She was a pale, emaciated girl, not more than eighteen, with\r\n     a sunbonnet on her head, and dressed in a clean calico gown.\r\n     'I could stand no longer,' she explained. As I made room for\r\n     her, I observed that she had delicate features and large eyes.\r\n     Her hair and dress were neat. As she raised her hand to remove\r\n     her sunbonnet and use it for a fan, her loose calico sleeve\r\n     slipped up, and revealed the mere skeleton of an arm. She\r\n     perceived my expression as I looked at it, and hastily pulled\r\n     down her sleeve with a short laugh. 'This is all that's left\r\n     of me!' she said. 'It seems real funny, don't it?' Evidently\r\n     she had been a pretty girl—a dressmaker's apprentice, I judged\r\n     from her chafed forefinger and a certain skill in the lines\r\n     of her gown. I was encouraged to ask: 'What is it? Is there\r\n     some celebration?'\r\n\r\n     \"'There _is_,' said the girl, solemnly; 'we celebrate our\r\n     right to live. We are starving. As soon as enough of us get\r\n     together we are going to the bakeries and each of us will take\r\n     a loaf of bread. That is little enough for the government to\r\n     give us after it has taken all our men.'\r\n\r\n     \"Just then a fat old black Mammy waddled up the walk to\r\n     overtake a beautiful child who was running before her. 'Come\r\n     dis a way, honey,' she called, 'don't go nigh dem people,'\r\n     adding, in a lower tone, 'I's feared you'll ketch somethin'\r\n     fum dem po'-white folks. I _wonder_ dey lets 'em into de\r\n     Park.'\r\n\r\n     \"The girl turned to me with a wan smile, and as she rose to\r\n     join the long line that had now formed and was moving, she\r\n     said simply, 'Good-by! I'm going to get something to eat!'\r\n\r\n     \"'And I devoutly hope you'll get it—and plenty of it,' I\r\n     told her. The crowd now rapidly increased, and numbered, I\r\n     am sure, more than a thousand women and children. It grew and\r\n     grew until it reached the dignity of a mob—a bread riot. They\r\n     impressed all the light carts they met, and marched along\r\n     silently and in order. They marched through Cary Street and\r\n     Main, visiting the stores of the speculators and emptying\r\n     them of their contents. Governor Letcher sent the mayor to\r\n     read the Riot Act, and as this had no effect he threatened to\r\n     fire on the crowd. The city battalion then came up. The women\r\n     fell back with frightened eyes, but did not obey the order\r\n     to disperse. The President then appeared, ascended a dray,\r\n     and addressed them. It is said he was received at first with\r\n     hisses from the boys, but after he had spoken some little time\r\n     with great kindness and sympathy, the women quietly moved on,\r\n     taking their food with them. General Elzey and General Winder\r\n     wished to call troops from the camps to 'suppress the women,'\r\n     but Mr. Seddon, wise man, declined to issue the order. While\r\n     I write women and children are still standing in the streets,\r\n     demanding food, and the government is issuing to them rations\r\n     of rice.\r\n\r\n     \"This is a frightful state of things. I am telling you of\r\n     it because _not one word_ has been said in the newspapers\r\n     about it. All will be changed, Judge Campbell tells me, if\r\n     we can win a battle or two (but, oh, at what a price!), and\r\n     regain the control of our railroads. Your General has been\r\n     magnificent. He has fed Lee's army all winter—I wish he could\r\n     feed our starving women and children.\r\n\r\n          \"Dearly,\r\n              \"AGNES.\"\r\n\r\nMy good Agnes reckoned without her host when she supposed General Pryor\r\nwould be rewarded for his splendid service on the Blackwater. He had\r\nnever ceased all winter to remind the Secretary of War of his promise\r\nto give him a permanent command. He now felt that he had earned it.\r\nHe had fought many battles, acquitting himself with distinction in\r\nall,—Williamsburg, Seven Pines, Mechanicsville, Gaines's Mill, Frazier's\r\nFarm, the Second Manassas, and Sharpsburg, besides the fight on the\r\nBlackwater.\r\n\r\nHe now wrote, April 6, 1863, an almost passionate appeal to the\r\nPresident himself, imploring that he be sent into active service, and\r\nnot be \"denied participation in the struggles that are soon to determine\r\nthe destinies of my country. If I know myself,\" he added, \"it is not the\r\nvanity of command that moves me to this appeal. A single and sincere\r\nwish to contribute somewhat to the success of our cause impels me to\r\nentreat that I may be assigned to duty. That my position is not the\r\nconsequence of any default of mine you will be satisfied by the enclosed\r\nletter from General Lee.\" The letter was followed by new promises. It\r\nwas supplemented by General Pryor's fellow-officers, who not only urged\r\nthat the country should not lose his services, but designated certain\r\nregiments which might easily be assigned to him. The President wrote\r\ncourteous letters in reply, always repeating assurances of esteem,\r\netc. The _Richmond Examiner_ and other papers now began to notice the\r\nmatter and present General Pryor as arrayed with the party against the\r\nadministration. This, being untrue, he contradicted. On March 17, 1863,\r\nthe President wrote to him the following:—\r\n\r\n     \"GENERAL ROGER A. PRYOR;\r\n\r\n     \"GENERAL: Your gratifying letter on the 6th inst. referring\r\n     to an article in the _Examiner_ newspaper which seems to\r\n     associate you with the opposition to the administration, has\r\n     been received.\r\n\r\n     \"I did not see the article in question, but I am glad it has\r\n     led to an expression so agreeable. The good opinion of one so\r\n     competent to judge of public affairs, and who has known me so\r\n     long and closely, is a great support in the midst of many and\r\n     arduous trials.\r\n\r\n          \"Very respectfully and truly yours,\r\n               \"JEFFERSON DAVIS.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the letters sent to Mr. Davis in General Pryor's behalf was one\r\nfrom General Lee and one from General Jackson, both of which unhappily\r\nremained in the President's possession, no copies having been kept by\r\nGeneral Pryor.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, my husband waited with such patience as he could\r\ncommand. Finally he resigned his commission as brigadier-general, and\r\nalso his seat in Congress, and entered General Fitz Lee's cavalry as a\r\nprivate soldier. His resignation was held a long time by the President\r\n\"in the hope it would be reconsidered,\" and repeatedly General Pryor\r\nwas \"assured of the President's esteem,\" etc. General Jackson, General\r\nLongstreet, General A. P. Hill, General D. H. Hill, General Wilcox,\r\nGeneral George Pickett, General Beauregard, were all his friends. Some\r\nof them had, like General Johnston and General McClellan, similar\r\nexperience. It was a bitter hour for me when my General followed me\r\nto the Amelia Springs with news that he had entered the cavalry as a\r\nprivate. \"Stay with me and the children,\" I implored.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said; \"I had something to do with bringing on this war. I must\r\ngive myself to Virginia. She needs the help of all her sons. If there\r\nare too many brigadier-generals in the service,—it may be so,—certain\r\nit is there are not enough private soldiers.\"\r\n\r\nThe Divinity that \"rules our ends, rough hew them as we may,\" was\r\nguiding him. I look back with gratitude to these circumstances,—then so\r\nhard to bear,—circumstances to which, I am persuaded, I owe my husband's\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nGeneral Fitz Lee welcomed him in hearty fashion:\r\n\r\n                                      \"HEADQUARTERS, August 26, 1863.\r\n\r\n     \"Honorable, General, or Mr? How shall I address you? Damn it,\r\n     there's no difference! Come up to see me. Whilst I regret the\r\n     causes that induced you to resign your position, I am glad,\r\n     really, that the country has not lost your active services,\r\n     and that your choice to serve her has been cast in one of my\r\n     regiments.\r\n\r\n          \"Very respectfully,\r\n               \"FITZ LEE.\"\r\n\r\nAs a common soldier in the cavalry service, General Pryor was assigned\r\nthe duties of his position, from not one of which did he ever excuse\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nOn May 3 General Lee had offered thanks to Almighty God for a great\r\nvictory at Chancellorsville.\r\n\r\nOn May 4, the date of Agnes's letter, news came that General Jackson\r\nhad been seriously wounded and his arm amputated. On May 10 the General\r\ndied, and we were all plunged into the deepest grief. By every man,\r\nwoman, and child in the Confederacy this good man and great general was\r\nmourned as never man was mourned before. From the moment of his death\r\nthe tide of fortune seemed to turn. Henceforth there would be only\r\ndisaster and defeat. In losing General Jackson our dear commander lost\r\nhis right arm. But this only inspired him to greater and more aggressive\r\naction.\r\n\r\nHe decided to take his army into Pennsylvania, and after entering that\r\nstate, on June 27, he issued his famous order, reminding one of General\r\nWashington's similar order from Pennsylvania, 1777:—\r\n\r\n     \"GENERAL ORDER NO. 73. FROM THE HEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF NORTHERN\r\n     VIRGINIA\r\n\r\n     \"The commanding general has observed the conduct of the\r\n     troops upon the march, and confidently anticipates results\r\n     commensurate with the high spirit they have manifested....\r\n     Their conduct has, with few exceptions, been in keeping with\r\n     their character as soldiers, and entitles them to approbation\r\n     and praise.\r\n\r\n     \"There have, however, been instances of forgetfulness, on\r\n     the part of some, that they have in keeping the yet unsullied\r\n     reputation of the army, and that the duties exacted of us by\r\n     civilization and Christianity are not less obligatory in the\r\n     country of the enemy than in our own.\r\n\r\n     \"The commanding general considers that no greater disgrace\r\n     could befall the army, and through it our whole people, than\r\n     the perpetration of the barbarous outrages upon the innocent\r\n     and defenceless, and the wanton destruction of private\r\n     property, which have marked the course of the enemy in our\r\n     country. Such proceedings not only disgrace the perpetrators\r\n     and all connected with them, but are subversive of the\r\n     discipline and efficiency of the army, and destructive of the\r\n     ends of our present movements. It must be remembered that we\r\n     make war only on armed men, that we cannot take vengeance for\r\n     the wrongs our people have suffered without lowering ourselves\r\n     in the eyes of all whose abhorrence has been excited by the\r\n     atrocities of our enemy, and offending against Him to whom\r\n     vengeance belongeth, without whose favor and support must all\r\n     prove vain.\"\r\n\r\nWashington, Lee, and McClellan were not alone in their ideas of\r\ncivilized and Christian warfare.\r\n\r\nEighty-four years before this time there was a war in this same country.\r\nIt was a rebellion, too, and a nobleman led the troops of Great Britain\r\nthrough the country to subdue the rebellion. The people through whose\r\nland he marched were bitterly hostile. They shot his foraging parties,\r\nsentinels, and stragglers; they fired upon him from every wood.\r\n\r\nOn January 28, 1781, this order was issued from camp near Beatty's Ford:—\r\n\r\n     \"Lord Cornwallis has so often experienced the zeal and good\r\n     will of the army that he has not the smallest doubt that the\r\n     officers and soldiers will most cheerfully submit to the ill\r\n     conveniences that must naturally attend war, so remote from\r\n     water, carriage, and the magazines of the army. The supply of\r\n     rum for a time will be absolutely impossible, and that of meal\r\n     very uncertain. It is needless to point out to the officers\r\n     the necessity of preserving the strictest discipline, and of\r\n     preventing the oppressed people from suffering violence by\r\n     the hands from whom they are taught to look for protection.\"\r\n\r\nAgain:—\r\n\r\n            \"HEADQUARTERS, CAUSLER'S PLANTATION, \"February 27, 1781.\r\n\r\n     \"Lord Cornwallis is highly displeased that several houses have\r\n     been set on fire to-day during the march—a disgrace to the\r\n     army—and he will punish to the utmost severity any person or\r\n     persons who shall be found guilty of committing so disgraceful\r\n     an outrage. His Lordship requests the commanding officers\r\n     of the corps will endeavor to find the persons who set fire\r\n     to the houses this day.... Any officer who looks on with\r\n     indifference and does not do his utmost to prevent shameful\r\n     marauding will be considered in a more criminal light than\r\n     the persons who commit these scandalous crimes.\"\r\n\r\nAgain:—\r\n\r\n                        \"HEADQUARTERS, FREELANDS, February 28, 1781.\r\n\r\n     \"A watch found by the regiment of Bose. The owner may have it\r\n     from the adjutant of that regiment upon proving property.\"\r\n\r\nAnother:—\r\n\r\n                                 \"SMITH'S PLANTATION, March 1, 1781.\r\n\r\n     \"BRIGADE ORDERS.—A woman having been robbed of a watch, a\r\n     black silk handkerchief, a gallon of brandy, and a shirt, and\r\n     as by description, by a soldier of the guards, the camp and\r\n     every man's kit is to be immediately searched for the same,\r\n     by the officer of the brigade.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it is that every circumstance of life is an opportunity for a\r\nnoble spirit. When we \"let slip the dogs of war,\" some men find excuse\r\nfor license and cruelty, others for the exercise of self-restraint\r\nand compassion. Admiral Porter tells a story which may illustrate\r\nthe strange \"point of view\" in the minds of some brave men upon the\r\nlegitimate conduct of war.\r\n\r\n\"The exploits of the army in foraging,\" said the Admiral, \"afforded\r\nmatter for much amusement among the officers at Vicksburg. At\r\nBruensburg, General Grant made his headquarters in the spring of 1863.\r\nBruensburg and the surrounding country was the great depot for live\r\nstock, grain, etc., and the soldiers' lines seemed to have fallen in\r\npleasant places. _Foraging was not prohibited_; in fact the soldiers\r\nwere cautioned to save the government rations for an emergency, so\r\nthat the squealing of pigs, the bleating of calves and sheep, and the\r\ncackling of poultry were common sounds in camp.\"\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the wholesale robbery of the peaceful citizens\r\nAdmiral Porter tells of an appeal made to General Grant by an old\r\nman, long past the age to bear arms, who pushed aside the flaps of the\r\nGeneral's tent and thrust in his head. In his hand he held a rope to\r\nwhich was attached a miserable mule, minus one eye. He told the General,\r\nin the poor-white's vernacular, of his nice little farm, well stocked\r\n\"with the finest lot of chickens, turkeys, pigs, an' sheep as ever you\r\nseen,\" and that the Yankee soldiers had stolen everything except the\r\n\"ole muel and one goose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, Rawlins, attend to this man,\" said the General, and walked away.\r\n\r\n\"What do you expect me to do?\" inquired General Rawlins. \"How are you\r\ngoing to find out who did all you complain of?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I _know_ who did it,\" said the old fellow; \"it's one of Gin'ral\r\nA. J. Smith's rigiments. I know the sargint what led 'em on. He\r\nbelongs to the Thirteenth Iowy, an' he kin skin a hog quicker'n greased\r\nlightnin'!\"\r\n\r\nJust then General Smith walked in the tent, and the complaint was laid\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n\"They weren't my men, sir,\" said General Smith. \"I know my boys too\r\nwell. They would never have left that mule and goose! No, sir, my boys\r\ndon't do things that way; and I advise you, old man, to go back and keep\r\nyour eye on your goose and mule.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man turned to gaze on his beloved mule. It was gone! A soldier\r\nstood at the end of the rope!\r\n\r\nGeneral Smith glanced proudly around. \"Ah, Rawlins,\" he said, \"those\r\nmust have been my men after all. If I could only hear they had eaten\r\nthe goose, I should be sure of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe story does not follow the aged man to his desolate cabin; but it\r\nfollowed the Admiral as an _amusing_ story for many an evening around\r\nthe punch-bowl.\r\n\r\nAmong the men arrayed against the South in battle were many worthy\r\ndescendants of the men who achieved their independence in 1775-1781,\r\nand who then fought shoulder to shoulder with the South.\r\n\r\n\"They were a brave, self-reliant, patriotic race, and in all the\r\ncharacteristics of manliness, perseverance, fortitude, and courage,\r\nwere the equals of any race that ever lived.\" It was from these men,\r\nnative-born Americans of the North and West, that many a persecuted\r\nwoman in Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina received help and\r\nrestitution of property. But war brutalizes mean men. The few cannot\r\ncontrol the many.\r\n\r\nWar, wicked, cruel war, knows no mercy, no justice. War is the dreadful\r\ncrime of the world. Against war prayer should ascend day and night until\r\nit shall cease forever. It is not right that it should be classed with\r\n\"pestilence and famine\" in our prayers. It should have an hour—a daily\r\nhour—to itself, when old men and women, young men and maidens, and\r\nlittle children should implore God to make wars to cease from the fair\r\nworld He has created.\r\n\r\nThe refugees who came to us from exposed districts within the enemy's\r\nlines thrilled our souls with horror. We heard these stories from the\r\nvalley of Virginia and from Norfolk. Liberty of speech in child or woman\r\nwas sternly punished. At Norfolk a clergyman, the Rev. Dr. Armstrong,\r\nhad been put in the chain gang and compelled to work on the streets\r\nbecause of disrespectful allusion to the presence of Federal troops.\r\nWe trembled at these recitals; but we never dreamed the war would come\r\nto us. At twilight, when the air was clear and still, we could hear\r\nthe booming of the heavy guns of the ironclads on James River; but\r\nMcClellan had been unable to take Richmond, and nobody would want little\r\nPetersburg.\r\n\r\nIn July, General Lee fought and lost the great battle of Gettysburg,\r\nwhich plunged our state into mourning and lamentation. Never can the\r\nworld read with dry eyes of the charge of Pickett's brigade and the\r\nmanner in which it was met. \"Decry war as we may and ought,\" says\r\nRhodes in his \"History,\" \"'breathes there the man with soul so dead' who\r\nwould not thrill with emotion to claim for his countrymen the men who\r\nmade that charge and the men who met it? General Lee bore the disaster\r\nmagnificently. An officer, attempting to place on other shoulders some\r\nportion of the blame, General Lee said solemnly, '_All this has been_\r\nMY _fault_—it is _I_ that have lost this fight, and you must all help\r\nme out of it in the best way you can.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Federal loss in this battle, killed, wounded, and captured, was\r\n23,003, the Confederate 20,451—making a total of 43,454 good and true\r\nmen lost, in one battle, to their country. The emblem of mourning hung\r\nat many a door among our friends in Richmond and Petersburg. Close upon\r\nthis disaster came news of the fall of Vicksburg.\r\n\r\nOn July 3d my General (this was before he resigned his commission) was\r\nin Richmond serving on a court-martial. In the evening he called upon\r\nMr. and Mrs. Davis, and was told the President was not receiving, but\r\nthat Mrs. Davis would be glad to see him. The weather was intensely hot,\r\nand my husband felt he must not inflict a long visit; but when he rose\r\nto leave, Mrs. Davis begged him to remain, and seemed averse from being\r\nleft alone. After a few minutes the President came in, weary, silent,\r\nand depressed. The news from Gettysburg sufficiently accounted for his\r\nmelancholy aspect.\r\n\r\nPresently a dear little boy entered in his night-robe, and kneeling\r\nbeside his father's knee repeated his evening prayer of thankfulness,\r\nand of supplication for God's blessing on the country. The President\r\nlaid his hand on the boy's head and fervently responded, \"Amen.\"\r\nThe scene recurred vividly, in the light of future events, to my\r\nhusband's memory. With the coming day came the news of the surrender\r\nof Vicksburg,—news of which Mr. Davis had been forewarned the evening\r\nbefore,—and already the Angel of Death was hovering near, to enfold the\r\nbeautiful boy and bear him away from a world of trouble.\r\n\r\nI had taken my young family to a watering place in the county of Amelia,\r\nand there a few homeless women like myself were spending the months of\r\nJuly and August. Everything was so sad there was no heart in any one\r\nfor gayety of any kind; but one evening the proprietor proposed that\r\nthe ball room be lighted and a solitary fiddler, \"Bozeman,\"—who was\r\nalso the barber,—be installed in the musicians' seat and show us what he\r\ncould do. Young feet cannot resist a good waltz or polka, and the floor\r\nwas soon filled with care-forgetting maidens—there were no men except\r\nthe proprietor and the fiddler. Presently a telegram was received by\r\nthe former. We all huddled together under the chandelier to read it.\r\nVicksburg had fallen! The gallant General Pemberton had been starved\r\ninto submission. Surely and swiftly the coil was tightening around us.\r\nSurely and swiftly should we, too, be starved into submission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nA HOMELESS WANDERER\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving no longer a home of my own, it was decided that I should go to my\r\npeople in Charlotte County. One of my sons, Theo, and two of my little\r\ndaughters were already there, and there I expected to remain until the\r\nend of the war.\r\n\r\nBut repeated attempts to reach my country home resulted in failure.\r\nMarauding parties and guerillas were flying all over the country. There\r\nhad been alarm at a bridge over the Staunton near the Oaks, and the old\r\nmen and boys had driven away the enemy. I positively _could_ not venture\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nSo it was decided that I should return to my husband's old district, to\r\nPetersburg, and there find board in some private family.\r\n\r\nI reached Petersburg in the autumn and wandered about for days seeking\r\nrefuge in some household. Many of my old friends had left town.\r\nStrangers and refugees had rented the houses of some of these, while\r\nothers were filled with the homeless among their own kindred. There was\r\nno room anywhere for me, and my small purse was growing so slender that\r\nI became anxious. Finally my brother-in-law offered me an overseer's\r\nhouse on one of his \"quarters.\" The small dwelling he placed at my\r\ndisposal was to be considered temporary only; some one of his town\r\nhouses would soon be vacant. When I drove out to the little house, I\r\nfound it hardly better than a hovel. We entered a rude, unplastered\r\nkitchen, the planks of the floor loose and wide apart, the earth beneath\r\nplainly visible. There were no windows in this smoke-blackened kitchen.\r\nA door opened into a tiny room with a fireplace, window, and out-door\r\nof its own; and a short flight of stairs led to an unplastered attic,\r\nso that the little apartment was entered by two doors and a staircase.\r\nIt was already cold, but we had to beat a hasty retreat and sit outside\r\nwhile a colored boy made a \"smudge\" in the house, to dislodge the wasps\r\nthat had tenanted it for many months. My brother had lent me bedding\r\nfor the overseer's pine bedstead and the low trundle-bed underneath. The\r\nlatter, when drawn out at night, left no room for us to stand. When that\r\nwas done, we had to go to bed. For furniture we had only two or three\r\nwooden chairs and a small table. There were no curtains, neither carpet\r\nnor rugs, no china. There was wood at the woodpile, and a little store\r\nof meal and rice, with a small bit of bacon in the overseer's grimy\r\ncloset. This was to be my winter home.\r\n\r\nPetersburg was already virtually in a state of siege. Not a tithe of\r\nthe food needed for its army of refugees could be brought to the city.\r\nOur highway, the river, was filled, except for a short distance, with\r\nFederal gunboats. The markets had long been closed. The stores of\r\nprovisions had been exhausted, so that a grocery could offer little\r\nexcept a barrel or two of molasses made from the domestic sorghum\r\nsugar-cane—an acrid and unwholesome sweet used instead of sugar for\r\ndrink with water or milk, and for eating with bread. The little boys\r\nat once began to keep house. They valiantly attacked the woodpile, and\r\nfound favor in the eyes of Mary and the man, whom I never knew as other\r\nthan \"Mary's husband.\" He and Mary were left in charge of the quarter\r\nand had a cabin near us.\r\n\r\nI had no books, no newspapers, no means of communicating with the\r\noutside world; but I had one neighbor, Mrs. Laighton, a daughter of\r\nWinston Henry, granddaughter of Patrick Henry. She lived near me with\r\nher husband—a Northern man. Both were very cultivated, very poor, very\r\nkind. Mrs. Laighton, as Lucy Henry,—a brilliant young girl,—had been one\r\nof the habitues of the Oaks. We had much in common, and her kind heart\r\nwent out in love and pity for me.\r\n\r\nShe taught me many expedients: that to float tea on the top of a cup\r\nof hot water would make it \"go farther\" than when steeped in the usual\r\nway; also that the herb, \"life everlasting,\" which grew in the fields\r\nwould make excellent yeast, having somewhat the property of hops; and\r\nthat the best substitute for coffee was not the dried cubes of sweet\r\npotato, but parched corn or parched meal, making a nourishing drink,\r\nnot unlike the \"postum\" of to-day. And Mrs. Laighton kept me a \"living\r\nsoul\" in other and higher ways. She reckoned intellectual ability the\r\ngreatest of God's gifts, raising us so far above the petty need of\r\nmaterial things that we could live in spite of their loss. Her talk was\r\na tonic to me. It stimulated me to play my part with courage, seeing\r\nI had been deemed worthy, by the God who made me, to suffer in this\r\nsublime struggle for liberty. She was as truly gifted as was ever her\r\nillustrious grandfather. To hear her was to believe, so persuasive and\r\nconvincing was her eloquence.\r\n\r\nI had not my good Eliza Page this winter. She had fallen ill. I had\r\na stout little black girl, Julia, as my only servant; but Mary had a\r\nfriend, a \"corn-field hand,\" \"Anarchy,\" who managed to help me at odd\r\nhours. Mrs. Laighton sent me every morning a print of butter as large\r\nas a silver dollar, with two or three perfect biscuits, and sometimes a\r\nbowl of persimmons or stewed dried peaches. She had a cow, and churned\r\nevery day, making her biscuits of the buttermilk, which was much too\r\nprecious to drink.\r\n\r\nA great snow-storm overtook us a day or two before Christmas. My\r\nlittle boys kindled a roaring fire in the cold, open kitchen, roasted\r\nchestnuts, and set traps for the rabbits and \"snowbirds\" which never\r\nentered them. They made no murmur at the bare Christmas; they were loyal\r\nlittle fellows to their mother. My day had been spent in mending their\r\ngarments,—making them was a privilege denied me, for I had no materials.\r\nI was not \"all unhappy!\" The rosy cheeks at my fireside consoled me for\r\nmy privations, and something within me proudly rebelled against weakness\r\nor complaining.\r\n\r\nThe flakes were falling thickly at midnight, when I suddenly became very\r\nill. I sent out for Mary's husband and bade him gallop in to Petersburg,\r\nthree miles distant, and fetch me Dr. Withers. I was dreadfully ill\r\nwhen he arrived—and as he stood at the foot of my bed I said to him: \"It\r\ndoesn't matter much for me, Doctor! But my husband will be grateful if\r\nyou keep me alive.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke from a long sleep, he was still standing at the foot of\r\nmy bed where I had left him—it seemed to me ages ago! I put out my hand\r\nand it touched a little warm bundle beside me. God had given me a dear\r\nchild!\r\n\r\nThe doctor spoke to me gravely and most kindly. \"I must leave you now,\"\r\nhe said, \"and, alas! I cannot come again. There are so many, so many\r\nsick. Call all your courage to your aid. Remember the pioneer women,\r\nand all they were able to survive. This woman,\" indicating Anarchy,\r\n\"is a field-hand, but she is a mother, and she has agreed to help you\r\nduring the Christmas holidays—her own time. And now, God bless you, and\r\ngood-by!\"\r\n\r\nI soon slept again—and when I awoke the very Angel of Strength and Peace\r\nhad descended and abode with me. I resolved to prove to myself that if\r\nI was called to be a great woman, I _could_ be a great woman. Looking\r\nat me from my bedside were my two little boys. They had been taken the\r\nnight before across the snow-laden fields to my brother's house, but\r\nhad risen at daybreak and had \"come home to take care\" of me!\r\n\r\nMy little maid Julia left me Christmas morning. She said it was too\r\nlonesome, and her \"mistis\" always let her choose her own places. I\r\nengaged \"Anarchy\" at twenty-five dollars a week for all her nights.\r\nBut her hands, knotted by work in the fields, were too rough to touch\r\nmy babe. I was propped upon pillows and dressed her myself, sometimes\r\nfainting when the exertion was over.\r\n\r\nI was still in my bed three weeks afterward, when one of my boys ran\r\nin, exclaiming in a frightened voice, \"Oh, mamma, an old gray soldier\r\nis coming in!\"\r\n\r\nHe stood—this old gray soldier—and looked at me, leaning on his sabre.\r\n\r\n\"Is this the reward my country gives me?\" he said; and not until he\r\nspoke did I recognize my husband. Turning on his heel, he went out, and\r\nI heard him call:—\r\n\r\n\"John! John! Take those horses into town and sell them! Do not return\r\nuntil you do so—sell them for anything! Get a cart and bring butter,\r\neggs, and everything you can find for Mrs. Pryor's comfort.\"\r\n\r\nHe had been with Fitz Lee on that dreadful tramp through the snow after\r\nAverill. He had suffered cold and hunger, had slept on the ground\r\nwithout shelter, sharing his blanket with John. He had used his own\r\nhorses, and now if the government needed him the government might mount\r\nhim. He had no furlough, and soon reported for duty; but not before he\r\nhad moved us, early in January, into town—one of my brother-in-law's\r\nhouses having been vacated at the beginning of the year. John knew his\r\nmaster too well to construe him literally, and had reserved the fine\r\ngray, Jubal Early, for his use. That I might not again fall into the\r\nsad plight in which he had found me, he purchased three hundred dollars\r\nin gold, and instructed me to prepare a girdle to be worn all the time\r\naround my waist, concealed by my gown. The coins were quilted in; each\r\nhad a separate section to itself, so that with scissors I might extract\r\none at a time without disturbing the rest.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the war to its last year Petersburg had remained\r\nin a state of comparative repose, broken only by the arrival and\r\ndeparture of the troops passing from the South to the Army of Northern\r\nVirginia. These, as we have said, were always welcomed, if they passed\r\nthrough by day, with gifts of flowers, fruit, and more substantial\r\nrefreshment.\r\n\r\nTo continue this greeting, Petersburg women denied themselves every\r\nluxury. The tramp of soldiers was a familiar sound in our streets, but\r\nno hostile footsteps had ever resounded there, no hostile gun had yet\r\nbeen fired within its limits. It is true the low muttering of distant\r\nartillery as it came up the James and the Appomattox from the field of\r\nBig Bethel had caught the ears of the citizens, and they had listened\r\nwith heightened interest in its louder booming as it told of Seven\r\nPines, and the seven days' struggle around Richmond, just twenty miles\r\naway. But when the baffled army of McClellan retired in the direction\r\nof Washington, and General Lee moved away beyond the Potomac, the old\r\nmen, women, and children (for there were no men left capable of bearing\r\narms) settled down to their daily avocations—and daily prayers for the\r\ndear boys at the front.\r\n\r\nFamilies that had fled from Petersburg at the time of McClellan's\r\nadvance upon Richmond had now returned. My next-door neighbors were Mr.\r\nThomas Branch and the Rev. Churchill Gibson. From one of my windows I\r\ncould look into a large garden, where the workmen were busy planting\r\nseeds and setting long rows of onions, cabbage plants, tomato plants,\r\nand sticks for the green peas just peeping out of the brown earth.\r\nAcross the street lived the widow of the Hon. Richard Kidder Meade,\r\nwith her accomplished daughters, Mary, Marion, and Julia. These were\r\ndelightful neighbors. Lower down lived the Bollings,—parents of Tabb\r\nBolling, the superb, already affianced to General Rooney Lee. Then\r\nMr. and Mrs. William Banister, with another houseful of lovely young\r\nwomen, \"Mollie\" and \"Gussie\" Banister; and their cousin, Alice Gregory,\r\nwaiting until the cruel war should be over to reward handsome Colonel\r\nArthur Herbert. Alice's own home was just outside our fortifications,\r\nand was, I believe, burned when Petersburg was assaulted. Beautiful\r\nPatty Hardee was another of these girls. Helen made the ninth of the\r\nband of Muses. All were accomplished in music. Marion's latest fancy\r\nwas significant,—Gottschalk's \"Last Hope!\" Sweet Alice took our hearts\r\nwith her touching hymns, giving a new meaning to the simplest words.\r\n\r\nGussie Banister, the youngest of all, sang \"Lorena\" and \"Juanita\"; and\r\nMattie Paul, who often came over from Richmond, infused an intenser tone\r\nof sadness with Beethoven's andantes and Chopin's \"Funeral March.\" None\r\nof the gayety of Richmond, of which we read in our letters, was apparent\r\nin Petersburg. Too many of her sons had been slain or were in present\r\nperil.\r\n\r\n\"What friends you girls are!\" I said, when I met them, walking together,\r\nlike a boarding school.\r\n\r\n\"We are all going to be old maids together,\" said one, \"and so we are\r\ngetting acquainted with each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak for yourself, John,\" said Helen, who had become the fortunate\r\npossessor of \"The Courtship of Miles Standish\" and was lending\r\n\"Longfellow's Last\" around to the rest. \"I spoke for _my_self, you\r\nremember,\" she added, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Well! it will be no disgrace to be an old maid,\" said another. \"We can\r\nalways swear our going-to-be-husband was killed in the war.\" And then\r\na wistful look passed over the young faces as each one remembered some\r\nabsent lover.\r\n\r\nThe camp-fire of my own family brigade was now lighted in the kitchen,\r\nwhere the hero, John, who had been left to take care of me, popped corn\r\nfor my little boys and held them with stories of Fitz Lee's pursuit of\r\nAverill.\r\n\r\n\"Tell us, John,\" implored his audience, \"tell us every bit of it. Begin\r\nat Winchester.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said John. \"You'll tell your ma, and then she won't sleep a wink\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"She doesn't sleep anyway, John! When we wake up, she's always sitting\r\nby the window, looking out at the stars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Co'se, if that's the case, here goes. Gen'al Lee had five thousand\r\ntroopers, an' they marched from Winchester to Salem. We hadn't a tent,\r\nan' no rations wuth talkin' about, an' it rained an' hailed an' sleeted\r\nmost every step o' the way. Your pa never took off his boots for two\r\nsolid weeks, an' they were full of water all the time, an' the icicles\r\nhung from his long hair. We drew up in line at the White Sulphur Springs\r\nan' _dar'd_ Averill to fight us—but he slunk away in the night. I\r\ncert'inly was sorry for Marse Roger at the White Sulphur. He went up\r\ninto the po'ch of one of the little cottages an' sat down thinkin' an'\r\nthinkin'. 'Are you sick, Marse Roger?' I asked him. 'No, John,' he said,\r\n'only a little homesick, to think of the happy times we used to spend\r\nhere—and our fathers and mothers before us!' 'But we done drive 'im\r\naway!' I say to him, an' he got up and said, 'Do you think so, John?'\r\nAnyway, Averill didn't git a chance to sleep in one of them cottages,\r\nnor yet to burn it! Ther' was a hospital thar' then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did _you_ sleep?\" the boys asked.\r\n\r\n\"Who, me? I slep' every night o' my life under the same blanket with\r\nyour pa, I did. I don' care how tired he was, he never slep' so sound\r\nhe couldn't hear the snorin'. 'Git up, John,' he would say, 'tell that\r\nman snorin' that he's burnin'.'\" John laughed at the reminiscence. \"I've\r\nscared many a good soldier that way, an' made him turn over—when the\r\nfightin' an' shootin' couldn't move him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you _did_ retreat after all, didn't you, John?\"\r\n\r\n\"Retreat! Retreat nothin'! Gen'al Lee got so he didn' care to ketch that\r\nscalawag Yankee. He warn' wuth ketchin'. We got pris'ners enough now an'\r\nto spar. Gen'al Lee come home cos he didn' have no use for Averill. He\r\ndrove him away, though. He sholy did!\"\r\n\r\nJohn was installed as cook and commissary-general. He had no material\r\nexcept flour, rice, peas, and dried apples, such grease or \"shortening\"\r\nas he could extract from bones he purchased of the quartermaster, and\r\nsorghum molasses. He made yeast of \"life everlasting\" I brought from the\r\ncountry,—and he gave us waffles and pancakes. John's pancakes, compared\r\nwith the ordinary article, were as the fleecy cloud to the dull, heavy\r\nclod beneath. Butter could be had at eight dollars a pound; meat was\r\nfour and five dollars a pound—prices we learned very soon afterward\r\nto regard as extremely cheap; bargains, indeed, of the first water.\r\nFrom Agnes's letters I have reason to suppose that Petersburg suffered\r\nmore from scarcity than did Richmond. There, dinners were given by the\r\nmembers of the Cabinet, and wine was served as of old. In Petersburg we\r\nhad already entered upon our long season of want. The town was drained\r\nby its generous gifts to the army; regiments were constantly passing,\r\nand none ever departed without the offer of refreshment.\r\n\r\nWe heard no complaints from our soldier boys, still in their winter\r\nquarters. But a letter to the army from General Lee filled our hearts\r\nwith anxiety.\r\n\r\n                            \"HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,\r\n                                                  \"January 22, 1864.\r\n\r\n     \"GENERAL ORDERS NO. 7.—The commanding general considers it due\r\n     to the army to state that the temporary reduction of rations\r\n     has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of those\r\n     charged with its support. Its welfare and comfort are the\r\n     objects of his constant and earnest solicitude and no effort\r\n     has been spared to provide for its wants. It is hoped that\r\n     the exertions now being made will render the necessity but of\r\n     short duration, but the history of the army has shown that the\r\n     country can require no sacrifice too great for its patriotic\r\n     devotion.\r\n\r\n     \"Soldiers! you tread, with no unequal steps, the road by which\r\n     your fathers marched through suffering, privation, and blood\r\n     to independence.\r\n\r\n     \"Continue to emulate in the future, as you have in the past,\r\n     their valor in arms, their patient endurance of hardships,\r\n     their high resolve to be free, which no trial could shake, no\r\n     bribe seduce, no danger appall; and be assured that the just\r\n     God who crowned their efforts with success will, in His own\r\n     good time, send down His blessings upon yours.\r\n\r\n          \"[Signed] R. E. LEE, _General_.\"\r\n\r\nCalm, strong, fatherly words! They deserve to be printed in letters\r\nof gold. They still have power to thrill the souls of the children\r\nof the fathers who marched through suffering, privation, and blood to\r\nindependence,—children who wait, still wait, for the fulfilment of his\r\npromise that God will in His own good time send down His blessing upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOn January the 30th Agnes wrote from Richmond:—\r\n\r\n     \"How can you be even dreaming of new cups and saucers? Mend\r\n     your old ones, my dear, with white lead. That is what we\r\n     are doing here; and when the cup is very much broken, the\r\n     triangular, rectangular, and other 'angular' lines of white\r\n     give it quite a Japanesque effect. There is not a bit of china\r\n     for sale in the capital of the Confederacy. A forlorn little\r\n     chipped set—twelve odd pieces—sold last week at auction for\r\n     $200—and as to hats and bonnets! We are washing the old ones\r\n     and plaiting straw for the new. I'll send you a package of\r\n     straw I gleaned and dyed for you last summer. Did I tell you\r\n     about that straw? I asked my host at the farmhouse to give me\r\n     a few sheaves, but he shook his head and opined it would be\r\n     'sinful in these hard times to take good vittles and convert\r\n     it into hats.' I could not see clearly that straw came under\r\n     the generic term 'vittles'—unless indeed the straw fed the\r\n     animal that fed the soldier. However, I meekly borrowed a\r\n     sunbonnet and gleaned my straw. Half of it I popped into\r\n     the kettle of boiling black dye behind the kitchen,—when the\r\n     lady of the manor was looking another way,—and we will mix\r\n     the black and white for the boys' hats. But mark the quick\r\n     and sure grinding of the mills of the gods. After the wheat\r\n     was all stacked there came a mighty rain with fog and warm\r\n     mist. One day my host brought in what seemed to be a feathery\r\n     bouquet of delicate green. It was a bunch of wheat, every\r\n     grain of which had sprouted. He had lost his crop!\r\n\r\n     \"President and Mrs. Davis gave a large reception last week,\r\n     and all the ladies looked positively gorgeous. Mrs. Davis is\r\n     in mourning for her father. We should not expect suppers in\r\n     these times, but we do have them! Champagne is $350 a dozen,\r\n     but we sometimes have champagne! The confectioners charge\r\n     $15 for a cake, but we have cake. My flounced gray silk is\r\n     behaving admirably, but I am afraid my Washington friends\r\n     remember it as an old acquaintance. I never go out without\r\n     meeting them. I have seen Dr. Garnett and Judge Scarborough\r\n     and Mr. Dimitri on the street, and often meet Mr. Hunter,\r\n     running about, in his enthusiasm, like a boy. But what do\r\n     you think? I never could bear that Lord Lyons, with his red\r\n     face and small eyes like ferrets'; and now we have reason\r\n     to suppose that England would have recognized us but for his\r\n     animosity against us. He says 'the Confederacy is on its last\r\n     legs.' We have heard from dear old Dudley Mann; but of course\r\n     _he_ can do nothing for us in England, and he had as well come\r\n     home and go with me to receptions. Mrs. Davis receives every\r\n     Tuesday, and Mr. Mann is a better squire of dames than he is\r\n     a diplomat.\"\r\n\r\nMy Petersburg beauties were all wearing hats of their own manufacture,\r\nthe favorite style being the Alpine with a pointed crown. For trimming,\r\nvery soft and lovely flowers were made of feathers, the delicate white\r\nfeather with a tuft of fleecy marabout at its stem. The marabout tuft\r\nwould be carefully drawn off, to be made into swan's-down trimming. A\r\nwire was prepared and covered with green paper for a stem, a little ball\r\nof wax fastened on the end, and covered with a tiny tuft of the down for\r\na centre, and around this the feathers were stuck—with incurving petals\r\nfor apple blossoms and half-open roses,—and reversed for camellias.\r\nNeatly trimmed and suitably tinted, these flowers were handsome enough\r\nfor anybody, and were in great demand. Cocks' plumes were also used\r\non hats, iridescent, and needing no coloring. With the downy breast\r\nof a goose which came into my possession I essayed the making of a\r\npowder-puff for my baby, but alas! the oil in the cuticle proved a\r\nperennial spring which could not be dried up by soda or sunning, and\r\nfinally I saw my powder-puff disappearing in a hole, drawn downward by\r\na vigorous and hungry rat.\r\n\r\nThe young girls who visited me never complained of their privations in\r\nthe matter of food, but they sorely grieved over their shabby wardrobes.\r\n\r\n\"I really think,\" said one, \"if we can only get along until we can wear\r\nwhite waists, we shall do very well. Every time a white waist is washed\r\nit's made new—but these old flannel sacks—ugh!\"\r\n\r\nOne day Mary Meade made me a visit. Always beautiful, her face wore on\r\nthis afternoon a seraphic, beatific expression.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, dear,\" I said, \"all about it.\" I supposed she had heard her\r\nlover had been promoted or was coming home on a furlough.\r\n\r\nShe held up her two hands. \"_It's just these gloves!_\" said Mary. \"I\r\ncan't help it. They make me perfectly happy! They have just come through\r\nthe blockade.\"\r\n\r\nThe butcher shops were closed, and many of the dry-goods stores; but\r\nsomebody had ordered a large quantity of narrow crimson woollen braid,\r\nand had failed to accept it. We seized upon it. Every one of us had\r\ngarments embroidered with it—in scrolls, Maltese crosses, undulating\r\nlines, leaves; all of which goes to prove that the desire for ornament\r\nis an instinct of our nature, outliving the grosser affections for the\r\ngood things of the table. The consciousness of being well dressed, we\r\nhave been told, will afford a peace of mind far exceeding anything to\r\nbe derived from the comforts of religion.\r\n\r\nIt had not been many years since every Virginia farm owned a house for\r\na great cumbrous loom, with beams supported against the ceiling. The\r\ndoor of the loom-house was again opened, and the weaver installed upon\r\nher high bench. Cotton cloth was woven and dyed yellow with butternut,\r\nblack with walnut-bark, gray with willow. A mordant to \"set the dye\" was\r\nunattainable—but at last rusty iron, nails, old horseshoes, old clamps\r\nand hinges, were found to be effective. Every atom of black silk was a\r\ntreasure. It was shredded to mix with the cotton before carding. Even\r\nnow the cells of my brain waken at the sight of a bundle of old black\r\nsilk, and my fingers would fain respond.\r\n\r\nPins became scarce. People walked about with downcast eyes; they were\r\nlooking for pins! Thorns were gathered and dried to use as pins.\r\nDentists' gold soon disappeared. The generation succeeding the war\r\nperiod had not good teeth. Anæsthetics—morphine, chloroform, opium—were\r\ncontraband of war. This was our great grief. Our soldier boys, who had\r\ndone nothing to bring the war upon the country, must suffer every pang\r\nthat followed the disasters of battle. The United States gave artificial\r\nlimbs to its maimed soldiers. Ours had only their crutches, and these of\r\nrude home manufacture. The blockade-running, for which our women were so\r\nmuch blamed, was often undertaken to bring morphine and medicine to our\r\nhospitals. The fashions of the day included a small round cushion worn\r\nat the back of a lady's belt, to lift the heavy hoop and many petticoats\r\nthen in vogue. It was called \"a bishop,\" and was made of silk. These\r\nwere brought home from \"a visit to friends at the North\" filled with\r\nquinine and morphine. They were examined at the frontier by a long pin\r\nstuck through them. If the pin met no resistance, they were allowed to\r\npass.\r\n\r\nThe famine moved on apace, but its twin sister, fever, never visited us.\r\nNever had Petersburg been so healthy. No garbage was decaying in the\r\nstreets. Every particle of animal or vegetable food was consumed, and\r\nthe streets were clean. Flocks of pigeons would follow the children who\r\nwere eating bread or crackers. Finally the pigeons vanished having been\r\nthemselves eaten. Rats and mice disappeared. The poor cats staggered\r\nabout the streets, and began to die of hunger. At times meal was the\r\nonly article attainable except by the rich. An ounce of meat daily was\r\nconsidered an abundant ration for each member of the family. To keep\r\nfood of any kind was impossible—cows, pigs, bacon, flour, everything,\r\nwas stolen, and even sitting hens were taken from the nest.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of such facts as these General Lee was able to report\r\nthat nearly every regiment in his army had reënlisted—and for the war!\r\nAnd very soon he also reported that the army was out of meat and had\r\nbut one day's rations of bread. One of our papers copied the following\r\nfrom the _Mobile Advertiser_:—\r\n\r\n     \"In General Lee's tent meat is eaten but twice a week,\r\n     the General not allowing it oftener, because he believes\r\n     indulgence in meat to be criminal in the present straitened\r\n     condition of the country. His ordinary dinner consists\r\n     of a head of cabbage boiled in salt water, and a pone of\r\n     corn bread. Having invited a number of gentlemen to dine\r\n     with him, General Lee, in a fit of extravagance, ordered a\r\n     sumptuous repast of bacon and cabbage. The dinner was served,\r\n     and behold, a great pile of cabbage and a bit of bacon, or\r\n     'middling,' about four inches long and two inches across. The\r\n     guests, with commendable politeness, unanimously declined\r\n     the bacon, and it remained in the dish untouched. Next day\r\n     General Lee, remembering the delicate titbit which had been\r\n     so providentially preserved, ordered his servant to bring that\r\n     'middling.' The man hesitated, scratched his head, and finally\r\n     owned up:—\r\n\r\n     \"'Marse Robert—de fac' is—dat ar middlin' was borrowed\r\n     middlin'. We-all didn' have no middlin'. I done paid it back\r\n     to de place whar I got it fum.'\r\n\r\n     \"General Lee heaved a sigh of deepest disappointment, and\r\n     pitched into the cabbage.\"\r\n\r\nNo man had ever lived in more comfort, nor was more surrounded by the\r\naccessories and appointments of luxury and refinement. His aide, Colonel\r\nWalter Taylor, has written me:—\r\n\r\n     \"During the time that General Lee was in service he manifested\r\n     that complete self-abnegation and dislike of parade and\r\n     ceremony which became characteristic of him. Accompanied\r\n     originally by a staff of but two persons, and, after the\r\n     death of Colonel Washington, with but one aide-de-camp,\r\n     with no escort or body-guard, no couriers or guides, he\r\n     made the campaign under altogether unostentatious and really\r\n     uncomfortable circumstances. One solitary tent constituted his\r\n     headquarters camp; this served for the General and his aide;\r\n     and when visitors were entertained, as actually occurred,\r\n     the General shared his blanket with his aide, turning over\r\n     those of the latter to his guest. His dinner service was of\r\n     tin,—tin plates, tin cups, tin bowls, everything of tin,—and\r\n     consequently indestructible; and to the annoyance and disgust\r\n     of the subordinates who sighed for porcelain could not\r\n     or would not be lost; indeed, with the help of occasional\r\n     additions, this tin furniture continued to do service for\r\n     several campaigns; and it was only in the last year of the\r\n     war, while the army was around Petersburg, that a set of\r\n     china was surreptitiously introduced into the baggage of the\r\n     headquarters of the army. This displaced for a time the chaste\r\n     and elaborate _plate_; but on resuming 'light marching order'\r\n     at the time of the evacuation of Richmond and Petersburg, the\r\n     china, which had been borrowed by the staff, was returned;\r\n     the tins were again produced, and did good service until the\r\n     surrender of the army, when they passed into the hands of\r\n     individuals who now preserve them as mementos of the greatest\r\n     commander in the great war.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE SIEGE OF PETERSBURG\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 9 will always be a sacred day to the citizens of Petersburg.\r\nEvery man capable of bearing arms had enlisted early in the service of\r\nthe Southern Confederacy. They felt that much was expected of them.\r\nPetersburg had behaved gallantly in 1776, and had been the \"Cockade\r\nCity\" in 1812. For the first three years of the war, as we have seen,\r\nno gun was fired near her gates. Only old men, women, and children were\r\nleft in the town. The maidens bore their denied lives with cheerfulness,\r\nsustained and encouraged by the steadfast and serene bearing of their\r\nelders. Everybody worked for the soldiers and assembled every afternoon\r\nto pray for them. The city was almost as quiet as Blandford, her sister\r\ncity of the dead, where the old Blands, Bollings, and Poythresses slept\r\nin perfect peace.\r\n\r\nTrue, Petersburg, like Richmond, had her day of feverish excitement,\r\nknown in Confederate history as \"_Pawnee_ Sunday,\" when both cities had\r\nbeen menaced by an ironclad. Early in the morning a telegraph operator\r\nhad relieved a dull hour by interviewing his colleague at City Point,\r\n\"Any danger from the _Pawnee_?\" receiving as answer, \"The _Pawnee_\r\nis coming up the Appomattox.\" The town was wild. Everything valuable\r\nwas hidden away, and the militia was drawn up, the lads of twelve and\r\nfourteen loading their hunting pieces and rallying to the town hall.\r\nTime having been allowed for any reasonable, well-conducted man-of-war\r\nto steam twelve miles, the telegraph operator, sorely pressed by\r\nquestions, again interrogated his City Point friend. \"What's become of\r\nthe _Pawnee_? She isn't here yet.\" The irate answer spun over the line:\r\n\"You—fool! I said the _Pawnee_ is _not_ coming up the river.\" Everything\r\nfell flat at once. There was an avowed sense of disappointment at the\r\nloss of an opportunity which might not come again. The dear women—the\r\nbest I have ever known in any land—resumed their gentle ministrations,\r\nworking much for the hospitals, and supplementing with culinary skill\r\nmany deficiencies in material. But the men chafed. The veterans had felt\r\nthe blood leap in their veins with the fire of youth; the boys longed\r\nfor the fray; the physician, tied to his humdrum routine, yearned for\r\nthe larger sphere in the field. \"The dearest sacrifice a man can make\r\nto his country is his ambition.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Pawnee_ incident was a fortunate one for the city, for it awakened\r\nthe authorities to the necessity of preparing against surprise. The\r\nold, exempt citizens were formed into companies for home defence, and a\r\nbreastwork was prepared commanding a road, \"particularly interesting,\"\r\nsays one of the survivors, \"because it opened to deserving Petersburgers\r\nthe beatific vision of Sussex hams and Southampton whiskey;\" for at that\r\nmoment the dreaded foe was the wolf already at the door, rather than\r\nthe possible thunderbolt.\r\n\r\nWhen General Butler, in June, 1864, commenced his advance against\r\nRichmond, which was intended as a coöperative movement with General\r\nGrant to accomplish what was done the following spring, he sent General\r\nKautz on June 9 to make a cavalry attack on Petersburg, twenty miles\r\nbelow Richmond. The city, as I have said, was almost defenceless. There\r\nhad been much strategy,—marching and countermarching,—too long a story\r\nto tell here; but one thing at least was accomplished, as one of the\r\nConfederate colonels pithily remarked, \"Whatever blunders were made,\r\nthe citizens and militia had been trotted out in the direction of the\r\nenemy at least.\" Kautz's superb cavalry appeared suddenly, was met by\r\nthe old men and boys of Petersburg, and was repulsed. Colonel Fletcher\r\nArcher commanded the militiamen. Forewarned only a few minutes before\r\nthe charge, he hastily formed his men into line. He says: \"And what a\r\nline! In number scarcely more than sufficient to constitute a single\r\ncompany, in dress nothing to distinguish them from citizens pursuing\r\nthe ordinary avocations of life, in age many of them silvered over with\r\nthe frosts of advancing years, while others could scarcely boast of\r\nthe down upon the cheek of youth; in arms and accoutrements such as an\r\nimpoverished government could afford them. But there was that in their\r\nsituation which lifted them above the ordinary rules of criticism.\r\nThey stood there, not as mercenaries who, having enlisted on account\r\nof profit, required the strong arm of military law to keep them to\r\ntheir post, nor as devotees of ambition craving a place in the delusive\r\npages of history, but they stood as a band of patriots whose homes were\r\nimperilled and whose loved ones were in danger of falling into the hands\r\nof an untried foe. As they stood in line before me I could see them\r\nglancing back at their own dwellings under the sun of a lovely June\r\nmorning. When I addressed them in a few words of encouragement, they\r\nlistened with gravity and a full appreciation of their situation. There\r\nwas no excitement, no shout, only calm resolution.\"\r\n\r\nThus their commander. What did the men themselves feel? One of them\r\nwrote: \"We had not long to wait. A cloud of dust in our front told of\r\nthe hurried advance of cavalry, and the next moment the glitter of spur\r\nand scabbard revealed a long line of horsemen half a mile in front of\r\nus. Oh, how we missed our cannon! Our venerable muskets were not worth a\r\ntinker's imprecation at longer range than a hundred yards, and we were\r\ncompelled perforce to watch the preparations for our slaughter, much\r\nafter the fashion that a rational turtle may be presumed to contemplate\r\nthe preliminaries of an aldermanic dinner.\"\r\n\r\nThese were the men who saved the city. It was in honor of them that the\r\nwomen and children marched through dust and heat on June 9, 1866, to\r\nlay garlands of flowers upon their humble graves, and by their pious\r\naction to inaugurate the beautiful custom, which is now observed all\r\nover the country, of honoring the dead who fell in the Civil War. No\r\nlovelier day ever dawned than June 9, 1864. The magnolia grandiflora\r\nwas in full flower, bee-haunted honey-locusts perfumed the warm air,\r\nalmost extinguishing the peachy odor of the microphylla roses, graceful\r\ngarlands of jessamine hung over the trellised front porches. Almost\r\nthe first intimation that the town received of its great peril was the\r\nimpetuous dash through the streets of the Confederate artillery. The\r\nmorning was so sweet and bright that the women and little children were\r\nabroad in the streets, on their way to market, or on errands to the\r\nshops, or to visit with fruit and flowers the old and sick among their\r\nfriends. Lossie Hill, the daintiest of dainty maidens, was picking her\r\nleisurely way in the dusty street, going to spend the morning with\r\nold Mrs. Mertens, when she heard the frantic shout: \"Get out of the\r\nway! Damn the women! Run over them if they won't get out of the way.\"\r\nThis was the morning greeting of the politest of gentlemen,—Captain\r\nGraham,—whose guns were thundering down the street to the rescue of\r\nthe slender line at the front. As fast as the dread news reached the\r\nmen exempt from duty, who were engaged in their various professions and\r\nvocations, every one dropped his business and rushed to the firing line.\r\nThe oldest men were as ardent as the youngest. One man, a druggist,\r\nbegan, while pulling on his accoutrements, to give directions to a\r\nvenerable clerk whom he expected to dispense drugs in his absence.\r\n\"Now,\" said the old man, \"if you want anything done at home you must\r\ntalk to somebody else! I am going to the front! I'm just like General\r\nLee. I should be glad if these fellows would go back to their homes\r\nand let us alone, but if they won't they must be made to, that's all.\"\r\nWith their arms around their father, pretty Molly and Gussie Banister\r\nimplored him not to go forth. He was president of the bank, he was frail\r\nand not young. \"The duty of every man lies yonder,\" said he, pointing to\r\nthe puffs of smoke at the gates of the town, and shouldering his musket\r\nhe marched away.\r\n\r\nMr. William C. Banister was a cultivated, Christian gentleman, one\r\nof Petersburg's most esteemed and beloved citizens. His widow and\r\nsweet daughters received him—dead—on the evening of the battle. Molly\r\nBanister, one of the dear girls who blessed my life in those anxious\r\ndays, has told the story of her martyred father's patriotic fervor:—\r\n\r\n\"My father had been on duty out on the lines on previous occasions,\r\nalways against the entreaty of the members of his family. We thought\r\nhis infirmity, deafness, ought to excuse him. Besides this, he was a\r\nbank officer and over military age. When the court-house bell, on the\r\nmorning of the 9th of June, sounded the alarm, he was at his place of\r\nbusiness, in the old Exchange Bank, and we hoped he would not hear it.\r\nHe got information, however, of the condition of things, came at once\r\nhome, and informed us of his purpose to go out to the lines. My mother\r\nand I besought him not to go, urging that he could not hear the orders.\r\n\r\n\"'If I can't hear,' he said, 'I can fight—I can fire a gun. This is no\r\ntime for any one to stand back. Every man that can shoulder a musket\r\nmust fight. The enemy are now right upon us.'\r\n\r\n\"Bidding us good-by he left the house. On the street, near our gate, was\r\na man, just from the lines. Addressing him, my father said, pointing to\r\nthe lines:—\r\n\r\n\"'My friend, you are needed in this direction.'\r\n\r\n\"'I am absent on leave,' said the man.\r\n\r\n\"'No leave,' replied my father, 'should keep you on such an occasion as\r\nthis. Every man should fight now!'\r\n\r\n\"I have been informed that as he came up from the bank he urged in the\r\nsame way all whom he met, capable, as he thought, of bearing arms.\"\r\n\r\nPatty Hardee's father, another man past age for military service, was\r\none of the first to report for duty, and among the first to be borne,\r\ndead, to his daughter.\r\n\r\nRobert Martin, also exempt, and the father of an adoring family,\r\nimmediately joined the ranks. Almost totally deaf, he could hear no\r\norders, and continued to load his gun after the order to cease firing\r\nwas given and the company had begun to move off. A comrade ran up,\r\nput his lips to his ear, and remonstrated. \"Stop firing!\" exclaimed\r\nthe veteran with disgust. \"Orders? I haven't heard any orders to stop\r\nfiring,\" and he continued to advance. As Nelson at Copenhagen, who, when\r\ntold that he had been signalled to stop fighting, turned his blind eye\r\nto the station, exclaiming, \"_I_ see no signal!\"\r\n\r\nThese are but a few of the many incidents which illustrate the courage\r\nof these stout-hearted veterans and the spirit behind their small force\r\nwhich inspired that courage and compelled success. They fought—one\r\nhundred and twenty-five men, badly armed and untrained—behind their\r\nfrail defence; one hundred and twenty-five against twenty-three hundred\r\nof the enemy, holding them at bay for two hours! General Butler was\r\ngreatly chagrined at the failure of this move upon Petersburg. He sent\r\na characteristic letter of reproof to his general officer north of\r\nthe Appomattox. After detailing all the mistakes that had led to the\r\nhumiliating repulse, he adds testily: \"You have endeavored to state in\r\nyour report what my orders to General Kautz were. That was no part of\r\nyour report. I know what my orders were without any information from\r\nthat source,\" adding, \"certain it is that forty-five hundred of my best\r\ntroops have been kept at bay by some fifteen hundred men, six hundred\r\nonly of which were Confederate troops and the rest old men and boys, the\r\ncradle and the grave being robbed of about equal proportions to compose\r\nthe force opposed to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"The cradle and the grave!\" Alas, yes! There was no triumph on the\r\nevening of that day. Half the gallant company was gone. There was\r\nwailing within the city gates that night. \"The hand of the reaper\" had\r\ntaken \"the ears that were hoary,\" and the daughters wept for the good,\r\ngray head gone forward to the \"eternal camping ground\" after a long\r\nlife of peace. For these gallant gentlemen the white rose which shaded\r\nmy door yielded all its pure blossoms. Well was it for the sake of my\r\nown devotion that this was an ever blooming rose! I had watered and\r\nnourished it with care, unconscious of its high vocation, to bud and\r\nblossom and lie on the noble heart of more than one soldier. My own\r\nhusband was in the fight, and sent the first news of the repulse of the\r\nenemy and the safety of his boyhood's home.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the battle on the line, June 9, we observed unusual\r\nactivity in our streets. Great army wagons passed continually, pausing\r\noften at a well before my door to water their horses. Clouds of dust\r\nfilled the city. Evidently something unusual was going on. \"We are only\r\nre-enforcing our defences,\" we said, and comforted ourselves in the\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nOne day my father came in unexpectedly. The army corps to which he was\r\nattached had camped near Petersburg!\r\n\r\n\"I've just met General Lee in the street,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI uttered an exclamation of alarm. \"Oh, _is_ he going to fight here?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear,\" said my father, sternly, \"you surprise me! The safest place\r\nfor you is in the rear of General Lee's army, and that happens to be\r\njust where you are! The lines are established just here, and filled with\r\nLee's veterans.\"\r\n\r\nThis was startling news, but more was to follow. One Sunday\r\nafternoon,—the next, I think,—the Presbyterian minister had gathered\r\nhis flock of women and children for service in the church opposite my\r\nhome, and had just uttered the first sentence of his opening prayer,\r\n\"Almighty Father, we are assembled to worship Thee in the presence of\r\nour enemies,\" when an awful, serpentlike hiss filled the church, and a\r\nshell burst through the wall.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the church was empty, and Dr. Miller, the pastor, was\r\ntelling me that his congregation had dismissed itself without a\r\nbenediction!\r\n\r\n\"And the shell?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"It lies upon the table in the church,\" said the doctor; \"nobody dares\r\nremove it.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the first shell that entered our part of the town. From that\r\nmoment we were shelled at intervals, and very severely. There were no\r\nsoldiers in the city. Women were killed on the lower streets, and an\r\nexodus from the shelled districts commenced at once.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the enemy brought up their siege guns of heavy artillery,\r\nthey opened on the city with shell without the slightest notice, or\r\nwithout giving opportunity for the removal of non-combatants, the sick,\r\nthe wounded, or the women and children. The fire was at first directed\r\ntoward the Old Market, presumably because of the railroad depot situated\r\nthere, about which soldiers might be supposed to collect. But the guns\r\nsoon enlarged their operations, sweeping all the streets in the business\r\npart of the city, and then invading the residential region. The steeples\r\nof the churches seemed to afford targets for their fire, all of them\r\ncoming in finally for a share of the compliment.\r\n\r\nTo persons unfamiliar with the infernal noise made by the screaming,\r\nricocheting, and bursting of shells, it is impossible to describe the\r\nterror and demoralization which ensued. Some families who could not\r\nleave the besieged city dug holes in the ground, five or six feet deep,\r\ncovered with heavy timbers banked over with earth, the entrance facing\r\nopposite the batteries from which the shells were fired. They made\r\nthese bomb-proofs safe, at least, and thither the family repaired when\r\nheavy shelling commenced. General Lee seemed to recognize that no part\r\nof the city was safe, for he immediately ordered the removal of all the\r\nhospitals, under the care of Petersburg's esteemed physician, Dr. John\r\nHerbert Claiborne. There were three thousand sick and wounded, many of\r\nthem too ill to be moved. A long, never-ending line of wagons, carts,\r\neverything that could run on wheels, passed my door, until there were no\r\nmore to pass. We soon learned the peculiar, deep boom of the one great\r\ngun which bore directly upon us. The boys named it \"Long Tom.\" Sometimes\r\nfor several weeks \"Long Tom\" rested or slept—and would then make up\r\nfor lost time. And yet we yielded to no panic. The children seemed to\r\nunderstand that it would be cowardly to complain. One little girl cried\r\nout with fright at an explosion; but her aunt, Mrs. Gibson, took her\r\nin her arms, and said: \"My dear, you cannot make it harder for other\r\npeople! If you feel very much afraid, come to me, and I will clasp you\r\nclose, but you mustn't cry.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Campbell, the historian, lived near us, at the Anderson\r\nSeminary. He cleared out the large coal cellar, which was fortunately\r\ndry, spread rugs on the floor, and furnished it with lounges and\r\nchairs. There we took refuge when the firing was unbearable. Some of\r\nour neighbors piled bags of sand around their houses, and thus made them\r\nbomb-proof.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dr. Hoge, who had come South from the Brick Church, New York,\r\nof which he had been pastor, was lying ill and dying a few miles from\r\nPetersburg, and my friend Mrs. Bland invited me to accompany her to\r\nvisit him. She had borrowed an ambulance from General Bushrod Johnson.\r\n\r\nWe made our call upon our sick friend, and were on our return when we\r\nwere suddenly startled by heavy firing. The ambulance driver was much\r\nexcited, and began to pour forth in broken English a torrent of abuse\r\nof the Confederacy. As we were near home, we kept silence, thinking\r\nthat, if he grew more offensive, we could leave him and walk. Mrs. Bland\r\nundertook to reason with him.\r\n\r\n\"What is your grievance?\" she inquired. \"Perhaps we might see the\r\ncolonel and arrange a better place for you—some transfer, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevare! nevare!\" said our man, \"I transfare to my own koontree! I make\r\nwhat you call—'desairt.' Mon Dieu! dey now tell me I fight for neeger!\r\nFrenshman nevare fight for neeger.\"\r\n\r\nAll this time the guns were booming away, and clouds of smoke were\r\ndrifting toward us. We were glad to arrive at my door.\r\n\r\nIt was closed. There was not a soul in the house. One of the chimneys\r\nhad been knocked down, and the bricks lay in a heap on the grass. I\r\nthought of Mr. Campbell's bomb-proof cellar; there we found my children,\r\nand there we remained until the paroxysmal shelling ceased.\r\n\r\nOne night, after a long, hot day, we were so tired we slept soundly. I\r\nwas awakened by Eliza Page, standing trembling beside me. She pulled me\r\nout of bed and hurriedly turned to throw blankets around the children.\r\nThe furies were let loose! The house was literally shaking with the\r\nconcussion from the heavy guns. We were in the street, on our way to our\r\nbomb-proof cellar, when a shell burst not more than fifty feet before\r\nus. Fire and fragments rose like a fountain in the air and fell in a\r\nshower around us. Not one of my little family was hurt.\r\n\r\nAnother time a shell fell in our own yard and buried itself in the\r\nearth. My baby was not far away, in her nurse's arms. The little\r\ncreature was fascinated by the shells. The first word she ever uttered\r\nwas an attempt to imitate them. \"Yonder comes that bird with the broken\r\nwing,\" the servants would say. The shells made a fluttering sound as\r\nthey traversed the air, descending with a frightful hiss, to explode or\r\nbe buried in the earth. When they exploded in midair by day, a puff of\r\nsmoke, white as an angel's wing, would drift away, and the particles\r\nwould patter down like hail. At night, the track of the shell and its\r\nexplosion were precisely similar in sound, although not in degree, to\r\nour Fourth of July rockets, except that they were fired, not upward,\r\nbut in a slanting direction. I never felt afraid of them! I was brought\r\nup to believe in predestination. Courage, after all, is much a matter\r\nof nerves. My neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Gibson and Mrs. Meade, agreed\r\nwith me, and we calmly elected to remain in town. There was no place of\r\nsafety accessible to us. Mr. Branch removed his family, and, as far as\r\nI knew, none other of my friends remained throughout the summer.\r\n\r\nNot far from the door ran a sunken street, with a hill, through which it\r\nwas cut, rising each side of it. Into this hill the negroes burrowed,\r\nhollowing out a small space, where they sat all day on mats, knitting,\r\nand selling small cakes made of sorghum and flour, and little round meat\r\npies. I might have been tempted to invest in the latter except for a\r\nslight circumstance. I saw a dead mule lying on the common, and out of\r\nits side had been cut a very neat, square chunk of flesh!\r\n\r\nWith all our starvation we never ate rats, mice, or mule-meat. We\r\nmanaged to exist on peas, bread, and sorghum. We could buy a little\r\nmilk, and we mixed it with a drink made from roasted and ground corn.\r\nThe latter, in the grain, was scarce. Mr. Campbell's children picked up\r\nthe grains wherever the army horses were fed.\r\n\r\nMy little boys never complained, but Theo, who had insisted upon\r\nreturning to me from his uncle's safe home in the country, said one day:\r\n\"Mamma, I have a queer feeling in my stomach! Oh, no! it doesn't ache\r\nthe least bit, but it feels like a nutmeg grater.\"\r\n\r\nPoor little laddie! His machinery needed oiling. And pretty soon his\r\nsmall brother fell ill with fever. My blessed Dr. Withers obtained a\r\npermit for me to get a pint of soup every day from the hospital, and\r\none day there was a joyful discovery. In the soup was a drumstick of\r\nchicken!\r\n\r\n\"I cert'nly hope I'll not get well,\" the little man shocked me by saying.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, is it as bad as that?\" I sighed.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" he replied, \"my soup will be stopped if I get better!\"\r\n\r\nJust at this juncture, when things were as bad as could be, my husband\r\nbrought home to tea the Hon. Pierre Soulé, General D. H. Hill, and\r\nGeneral Longstreet. I had bread and a little tea, the latter served in a\r\nyellow pitcher without a handle. Mrs. Campbell, hearing of my necessity,\r\nsent me a small piece of bacon.\r\n\r\nWhen we assembled around the table, I lifted my hot pitcher by means of\r\na napkin, and offered my tea, pure and simple, allowing the guests to\r\nuse their discretion in regard to a spoonful or two of very dark brown\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n\"This is a great luxury, Madam,\" said Mr. Soulé, with one of his\r\ngracious bows, \"a good cup of tea.\"\r\n\r\nWe talked that night of all that was going wrong with our country, of\r\nthe good men who were constantly relieved of their commands, of all the\r\nmistakes we were making.\r\n\r\n\"Mistakes!\" said General Hill, bringing his clenched fist down upon the\r\ntable, \"I could forgive mistakes! I cannot forgive lies! I could get\r\nalong if we could _only_, _only_ ever learn the truth, the real truth.\"\r\nBut he was very personal and used much stronger words than these.\r\n\r\nThey talked and talked, these veterans and the charming, accomplished\r\ndiplomat, until one of them inquired the hour. I raised a curtain.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" I said, \"the sun is rising. You must now breakfast with\r\nus.\" They declined. They had supped!\r\n\r\nI had the misfortune early in June to fall ill, with one of the sudden,\r\nviolent fevers which cannot be arrested, but must \"run its course\" for\r\na certain number of days. I was delirious from this fever, and wild with\r\nthe idea that a battle was raging within hearing. I fancied I could hear\r\nthe ring of the musket as it was loaded! Possibly my quickened senses\r\nhad really heard, for a fierce battle was going on at Port Walthall,\r\na station on the Richmond and Petersburg railroad, six miles distant.\r\nGeneral Butler had landed at Bermuda Hundred and had been sent by\r\nGeneral Grant to lead a column against Richmond on the south side of\r\nthe James and to coöperate with forces from the Wilderness. Butler had\r\nreached Swift Creek, there to be met by General Johnson, and repulsed\r\nas far as Walthall Junction on the railroad. The following day there\r\nwas a hotly contested battle at close quarters, continued on the next,\r\nwhen our men, although greatly outnumbered by Butler's forces, drove\r\nthese back to their base on the James River. All this time my excited\r\nvisions were of battle and soldiers, culminating at last by the presence\r\nof one soldier, leaning wearily on his sabre in my own room. I did not\r\nrecognize the soldier, but memory still holds his attitude of grief as\r\nhe looked at me, and the sound of his voice as he answered my question,\r\n\"Where have you been all this time?\" with, \"In more peril than in all\r\nmy life before.\"\r\n\r\nBut the fever crisis was passing even then, and I was soon well enough\r\nto learn more. This was another of the well-planned schemes for taking\r\nRichmond, another of the failures which drew from Lincoln the gravely\r\nhumorous reply, when application was made to him for a pass to go to\r\nRichmond:—\r\n\r\n\"I don't know about that; I have given passes to about two hundred and\r\nfifty thousand men to go there during the last two or three years, and\r\nnot one of them has got there yet.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Claiborne went out to this Walthall battle-field to help the\r\nwounded, taking with him surgeons and ambulances. A dreadful sight\r\nawaited him. Bodies of dead men, Federal and Confederate, lay piled\r\ntogether in heaps. On removing some of these to discover if any one of\r\nthem might be still alive, a paper dropped from the pocket of a young\r\nlieutenant, written in German to a lady in Bremen. Upon reading it, Dr.\r\nClaiborne found it was addressed to his betrothed. He told her that his\r\nterm of service having expired, he would soon leave for New York City,\r\nand he gave her the street and number where she should meet him on her\r\narrival in this country. This was his last fight, into which he went\r\nno doubt voluntarily, as he was about to leave the army. Doubtless the\r\nblue-eyed _Mädchen_ looked long for him on the banks of the Weser! The\r\ndoctor indorsed the sad news on the letter, and sent it through the\r\nlines. Perhaps it reached her, or perhaps she is telling her story this\r\nday to other blue eyes on the Weser, eyes that look up and wonder she\r\ncould ever have been young, lovely, and the promised bride of a gallant\r\nUnion officer.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate government utterly neglected the praise and distinction\r\nso freely awarded by other nations in time of war, for deeds of\r\ngallantry and valor. Says Major Stiles: \"Not only did I never see or\r\nhear of a promotion on the field, but I do not believe such a thing\r\never occurred in any army of the Confederacy from the beginning to the\r\nend of the war. Indeed, I am confident it never did; for, incredible\r\nas it may appear, even Lee himself did not have the power to make such\r\npromotion. I never saw or heard of a medal or a ribbon being pinned on\r\na man's jacket, or even so much as a man's name being read out publicly\r\nin orders of gallantry in battle.\"[18]\r\n\r\nHanging in my husband's library, among other war relics, is a heavy\r\nsilver medal, representing in high relief a soldier charging a cannon.\r\nOn the obverse side is a laurel wreath, space for a name, and the words,\r\n\"Distinguished for courage: U. S. Colored Troops.\" No such medal was\r\never given by our government to its hardly used, poorly paid private\r\nsoldiers. Some of them fought through the war. They starved and froze in\r\nthe trenches during that last dreadful winter, but no precious star or\r\nribbon was awarded, to be hung with the sabre or musket and venerated\r\nby generations yet to come. Among my few preserved papers I have two\r\nin faded ink. One is signed Bushrod Johnson, the other D. H. Hill.\r\nThe latter says: \"The victory at Walthall Junction was greatly due to\r\nGeneral Roger A. Pryor. But for him it is probable we might have been\r\nsurprised and defeated.\" The other from General Johnson runs at length:\r\n\"At the most critical juncture General Roger A. Pryor rendered me\r\nmost valuable service, displaying great zeal, energy, and gallantry in\r\nreconnoitring the positions of the enemy, arranging my line of battle,\r\nand rendering successful the operations and movements of the conflict.\"\r\nAt General Johnson's request my husband served with him during the\r\nmidsummer. Such letters I have in lieu of medal or ribbon,—a part only\r\nof much of similar nature; but less was given to many a man who as fitly\r\ndeserved recognition.\r\n\r\nMy General, who had been in active service in all the events around\r\nPetersburg, was now requested by General Lee to take with him a small\r\nsquad of men, and learn something of the movements of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"Grant knows all about me,\" he said, \"and I know too little about Grant.\r\nYou were a schoolboy here, General, and have hunted in all the bypaths\r\naround Petersburg. Knowing the country better than any of us, you are\r\nthe best man for this important duty.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, armed with a pass from General Lee, my husband set forth\r\non his perilous scouting expedition, sometimes being absent a week at\r\na time. One morning, very early, he entered my room.\r\n\r\n\"I am dead for want of sleep,\" he said. \"I was obliged to take some\r\nprisoners. They are coming in under guard, and you must give them a\r\ngood breakfast.\" As he walked out of the room to find a quiet corner,\r\nhe called back, \"Be sure, now! Feed my prisoners, if all the rest of us\r\nlose our breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nHe had suggested the only way in which he could be obeyed.\r\n\r\nFive forlorn blue-coated soldiers soon appeared, and lay down under\r\nthe trees. Presently they were all asleep. I called my little family\r\ntogether. We had only a small pail of meal. Would they be willing to\r\ngive it to these poor prisoners?\r\n\r\nThey were willing, never fear; but I had trouble with John. He grew\r\nvery sullen when I ordered him to bake the bread for Yankee prisoners in\r\nfive small loaves. I promised to send out for more provisions later, and\r\nfinally he yielded, but with an ill grace. When the hot loaves were on\r\nthe table, flanked by sweetened corn-coffee, I deputed Paterson Gibson,\r\nmy neighbor's kindly young son, to waken my guests. This was no easy\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\"Come, now, Yank,\" said Pat, \"get up and eat your breakfast. Come now!\r\nCheer up! We'll send you home pretty soon.\"\r\n\r\nWe left them alone at their repast. It occurred to me they might try to\r\nescape, and I heartily wished they would. But after an hour they were\r\nmarched away, we knew not whither.\r\n\r\nOn July 30th occurred the dreadful explosion of the mine which the enemy\r\nhad tunnelled under our line of fortifications.\r\n\r\nA little after four in the morning the city was roused by the most\r\nawful thunder—like nothing I can imagine, except, perhaps, the sudden\r\neruption of a volcano. This was the explosion of a mine tunnelled by\r\nGeneral Grant under our works. Instantly the unhappy residents of the\r\ntown poured into the street and out on the road, anywhere to escape\r\nwhat we supposed to be an earthquake. No words can adequately describe\r\nthis horror! We lost a part of our line. Colonel Paul, a member of\r\nBeauregard's staff, was sent to inform General Lee of the disaster,\r\nand bore back his orders that the line must be at once recaptured. As\r\nthe colonel passed his father's house, he ran in and found the old\r\ngentleman's hand on the bell-rope to summon his household to family\r\nprayers.\r\n\r\n\"Stay, my son, and join us at prayers,\" said the old man. \"Get some\r\nbreakfast with your mother and me.\" The colonel could not pause. He must\r\nleave this peaceful home, and bear his part in protecting it.\r\n\r\nWhen the veterans meet to-day for their camp-fire talk, it is of the\r\n\"battle of the Crater,\" the shocking incidents of which cannot be told\r\nto gentle ears, that they speak most frequently. The fountain of fire\r\nthat shot up to heaven bore with it the dismembered bodies of man made\r\nin God's own image. Then infuriated men, black and white, leaped into\r\nthe chasm and mingled in an orgy of carnage. No one has ever built\r\non that field. Nature smooths its scars with her gentle hand, but no\r\ndwelling of man will ever rest there while this tragedy is remembered.\r\n\r\nOn May 3d, 1887, Federal and Confederate veterans met on this spot and\r\nclasped hands together. Since then the Confederates have met there again\r\nand again. Each one has some story to tell of heroism, of devotion, and\r\nthe stories are not always tragic. Some of them have been gleaned from\r\nthe experiences of the boys in blue.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Bowley of the Northern army delivered an address before the\r\nCalifornia commandery of the Loyal Legion of the United States, and\r\nquotes from the address of a negro preacher to his fellows just before\r\nthe explosion of the crater. He was sergeant of a company of negroes,\r\nand thus exhorted them:—\r\n\r\n\"Now, men, dis is gwine to be a gret fight, de gretest we seen yit; gret\r\nthings is 'pending on dis fight; if we takes Petersburg, mos' likely\r\nwe'll take Richmond an' 'stroy Lee's army an' close de wah. Eb'ry man\r\nhad orter liff up his soul in pra'r for a strong heart. Oh! 'member de\r\npore colored people ober dere in bondage. Oh! 'member dat Gin'ral Grant\r\nan' Gin'ral Burnside an' Gin'ral Meade an' all de gret gin'rals is right\r\nober yander a watchin' ye; an' 'member _I'se_ a watchin' ye an 'any\r\nskulker is a gwine ter git a prod ob dis ba'net—you heah me!\"\r\n\r\nWords than which, except for the closing sentence, I know none more\r\npathetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nBEHIND LEE'S LINES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe month of August in the besieged city passed like a dream of terror.\r\nThe weather was intensely hot and dry, varied by storms of thunder and\r\nlightning—when the very heavens seemed in league with the thunderbolts\r\nof the enemy. Our region was not shelled continuously. One shot from\r\n\"our own gun,\" as we learned to call it, would be fired as if to let\r\nus know our places; this challenge would be answered from one of our\r\nbatteries, and the two would thunder away for five or six hours. We\r\nalways sought shelter in Mr. Campbell's bomb-proof cellar at such times,\r\nand the negroes would run to their own \"bum-proofs,\" as they termed the\r\ncells hollowed under the hill.\r\n\r\nAgnes wrote from Richmond, August 26, 1864:—\r\n\r\n     \"You dear, obstinate little woman! What did I tell you? I\r\n     implored you to get away while you could, and now you are\r\n     waiting placidly for General Grant to blow you up. That awful\r\n     crater! Do the officers around you consider it honorable\r\n     warfare to dig and mine under a man and blow him up while\r\n     he is asleep—before he has time to get his musket? I always\r\n     thought an open field and a fair fight, with the enemy in\r\n     front at equal chances, was the American idea of honest,\r\n     manly warfare. To my mind this is the most awful thing that\r\n     could be imagined. There is a strong feeling among the people\r\n     I meet that the hour has come when we should consider the\r\n     lives of the few men left to us. Why let the enemy wipe us\r\n     off the face of the earth? Should this feeling grow, nothing\r\n     but a great victory can stop it. Don't you remember what Mr.\r\n     Hunter said to us in Washington? 'You may sooner check with\r\n     your bare hand the torrent of Niagara than stop this tidal\r\n     wave of secession.' _I_ am for a tidal wave of peace—and\r\n     I am not alone. Meanwhile we are slowly starving to death.\r\n     Here, in Richmond, if we can afford to give $11 for a pound\r\n     of bacon, $10 for a small dish of green corn, and $10 for a\r\n     watermelon, we can have a dinner of three courses for four\r\n     persons. Hampton's cavalry passed through town last week, amid\r\n     great excitement. Every man as he trotted by was cutting and\r\n     eating a watermelon, and throwing the rinds on the heads of\r\n     the little negro boys who followed in crowds on either side\r\n     of the street. You wouldn't have dreamed of war—such shouting\r\n     and laughing from everybody. The contrasts we constantly\r\n     see look like insanity in our people. The President likes\r\n     to call attention to the fact that we have no beggars on our\r\n     streets, as evidence that things are not yet desperate with\r\n     us. He forgets our bread riot which occurred such a little\r\n     while ago. That pale, thin woman with the wan smile haunts\r\n     me. Ah! these are the people who suffer the consequence of\r\n     all that talk about slavery in the territories you and I used\r\n     to hear in the House and Senate Chamber. Somebody, somewhere,\r\n     is mightily to blame for all this business, but it isn't you\r\n     nor I, nor yet the women who did not really deserve to have\r\n     Governor Letcher send the mayor to read the Riot Act to them.\r\n     They were only hungry, and so a thousand of them loaded some\r\n     carts with bread for their children. You are not to suppose\r\n     I am heartless because I run on in this irrelevant fashion.\r\n     The truth is, I am so shocked and disturbed I am hysterical.\r\n     It is all so awful.\r\n\r\n          \"Your scared-to-death\r\n               \"AGNES.\"\r\n\r\nMy husband sent me a note by his courier, one hot August day, to tell\r\nme that his old aide, Captain Whitner, having been wounded, was now\r\ndischarged from the hospital, but was much too weak for service in the\r\ntrenches, so he had obtained for the captain leave of absence for two\r\nweeks, and had sent him to me to be built up. On the moment the sick\r\nman appeared in an ambulance. I was glad to see him, but a gaunt spectre\r\narose before my imagination and sternly suggested: \"Built up, forsooth!\r\nAnd pray, what are you to build him up with? You can no more make a man\r\nwithout food than the Israelites could make bricks without straw.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, the captain had brought a ration of bacon and meal, with\r\npromise of more to come. I bethought me of the flourishing garden of my\r\nneighbor, whose onions and beets were daily gathered for her own family.\r\nI wrote a very pathetic appeal for my wounded Confederate soldier, now\r\nthreatened with scurvy for want of fresh food, and I fully expected\r\nshe would be moved by my eloquence and her own patriotism to grant me\r\na daily portion from her garden. She answered that she would agree\r\nto send me a dish of vegetables fourteen days for fourteen dollars.\r\nGold was then selling at the rate of twenty-five dollars in our paper\r\ncurrency for one dollar in gold, so the dish was not a very costly one.\r\nBut when it appeared it was a very small dish indeed,—two beets or four\r\nonions. Homœopathic as were the remedial agents, they helped to cure\r\nthe captain.\r\n\r\nOne morning, late in August, Eliza came early to my bedside. I started\r\nup in alarm.\r\n\r\n\"Shelling again?\" I asked her.\r\n\r\n\"Worse,\" said Eliza.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, tell me quick—is the General—\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, honey,\" said my kind nurse, laying a detaining hand upon me.\r\n\"You cert'nly sleep sound! Didn't you hear a stir downstairs in the\r\nnight? Well, about midnight somebody hallooed to the kitchen, and John\r\nran out. There stood a man on horseback and a dead soldier lying before\r\nhim on the saddle. He said to John, 'Boy, I know General Pryor would\r\nnot refuse to take in my dead brother.'\r\n\r\n\"John ran up to my room and asked me what he must do. 'Take him in,' I\r\ntold him. 'Marse Roger will never forgive you if you turn him away.'\"\r\n\r\n\"You were perfectly right,\" I said, beginning to dress myself. \"Where\r\nis he?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the parlor,\" said Eliza. \"He had a manservant with him. John brought\r\nin his own cot, and he is lying on it. His brother is in there, and his\r\nman, both of them.\"\r\n\r\nThe children were hushed by their nurse's story, and gathered under\r\nthe shade in the yard. When breakfast was served, I sent John to invite\r\nmy guest in. He returned with answer that \"the captain don' feel like\r\neatin' nothin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"No'm, he ain't a captain, but his dead brother was. He was Captain\r\nSpann of South Carolina or Georgia, I forget which. His man came into\r\nthe kitchen for hot water to shave his dead master, but I didn't ask\r\nmany questions 'cause I saw he was troubled.\"\r\n\r\nI went out to my ever blooming rose and found it full of cool, dewy\r\nblossoms. I cut an armful, and knocked at the parlor door myself. It\r\nwas opened by a haggard, weary-looking soldier, who burst into tears\r\nat seeing me. I took his hand and essayed to lead him forth, but he\r\nbrokenly begged I would place the roses upon his brother's breast. \"Will\r\nyou, for the sake of his poor wife and mother?\"\r\n\r\nVery calm was the face of the dead officer. His servant and his brother\r\nhad shaven and cared for him. His dark hair was brushed from a noble\r\nbrow, and I could see that his features were regular and refined.\r\n\r\nI persuaded the lonely watcher to go with John to an upper room, to\r\nbathe and rest a few minutes; but he soon descended and joined us at our\r\nfrugal breakfast, and then Mr. Gibson, my good rector, came in to help\r\nand advise, and in the evening my husband returned, much gratified that\r\nwe had received and comforted the poor fellow.\r\n\r\nAs August drew to a close, I began to perceive that I could no longer\r\nendure the recurrence of such scenes; and I learned with great relief\r\nthat my brother-in-law had moved his family to North Carolina and had\r\nplaced Cottage Farm, three miles distant from the besieged city, at my\r\ndisposal. Accordingly, I wrote to General Bushrod Johnson, requesting an\r\narmy wagon to be sent me early the next morning, and all night was spent\r\nin packing and preparing to leave. I had collected needful furniture\r\nwhen I moved into town eight months before.\r\n\r\nThe wagon did not come at the specified hour. All day we waited, all the\r\nnext night (without our beds), and the next day. As I looked out of the\r\nwindow in the twilight, hoping and watching, the cannonading commenced\r\nwith vigor, and a line of shells rose in the air, describing luminous\r\ncurves and breaking into showers of fragments. Our gun will be next, I\r\nthought, and for the first time my strength forsook me, and I wept over\r\nthe hopeless doom which seemed to await us. Just then I heard the wheels\r\nbelow my window, and there was my wagon with four horses.\r\n\r\nWe were all bestowed, bag and baggage, in a few minutes, and were soon\r\nsafely beyond shell fire. I did not know until then how great had been\r\nthe strain of keeping up under fire for three months. I literally \"went\r\nall to pieces,\" trembling as though I had a chill. When we arrived\r\nat Cottage Farm, my driver allowed John, Eliza, and my little boys to\r\nunload in the road before the lawn, and then calmly turned his horses'\r\nheads and drove away.\r\n\r\nIt was nine o'clock, we had no lights, we had no strength to lift our\r\npackages into the house. John advised that he should remain on guard\r\nduring the night, and that some blankets should be spread for us in the\r\ncottage, and we proceeded to carry out this plan. In a few minutes,\r\nhowever, half a dozen soldiers came up, and one of their officers\r\npleasantly greeted us as \"welcome neighbors,\" for their company was\r\nencamped near us. They had seen our plight and had come to \"set things\r\nto rights,\" also to assure us of protection.\r\n\r\nAbout twelve o'clock we found ourselves comfortable. Our beds were put\r\nup, our boxes were all under cover. John's commissariat yielded some\r\nbiscuits, there was a well of pure water near the door. We were safe.\r\nWe could sleep. No shell could reach us!\r\n\r\nThe cool freshness of a lovely September morning filled our hearts with\r\nlife and hope. A large circle of flowers, chrysanthemums, dahlias, and\r\nlate-blooming roses surrounded the carriage drive to the door, a green\r\nlawn stretched to the limits of a large yard in the rear, and beyond\r\nthis a garden with a few potatoes to dig, and an apple tree in fruit\r\nwhich the soldiers had respected. John and the little boys were in fine\r\nspirits. They laid plans for a cow, chickens, ducks, and pigeons. The\r\ncow was purchased at once from a neighboring farmer, was named Rose,\r\nand was installed in a shelter attached to the kitchen, where John could\r\nprotect her from marauders.\r\n\r\n\"'Cause,\" said John, \"I knows soldiers! They get up before day and milk\r\nyour cow under your very eyebrows. Ain't you hear about Gen'al Lee in\r\nPennsylvania? The old Dutch farmers gave him Hail Columbia because his\r\nsoldiers milked their cows. Gen'al Lee could keep 'em from stealin'\r\nhorses, but the queen o' England herself couldn't stop a soldier when\r\nhe hankers after milk. An' he don't need no pail, neither; he can milk\r\nin his canteen an' never spill a drop.\"\r\n\r\nMy brother had left two old family servants, \"Uncle Frank\" and his wife\r\n\"Aunt Jinny,\" as caretakers of the premises; and to their dignified\r\nbearing, supplemented by the presence of a company of honorable\r\nsoldiers, we were indebted for the unrifled apple tree and the tiny\r\npotatoes, like marbles, left after the autumn digging. \"Aunt Jinny\" also\r\nhad a few fowls. An egg for my baby was now possible.\r\n\r\nHer faithful Christian character had won for her a high place in the\r\nesteem of the family. Uncle Frank's manners were perfect,—polished,\r\nsuave, and conciliatory; but when judge and jury sat upon the case of\r\na culprit arraigned by him, his testimony was apt to be challenged by\r\nhis prisoner.\r\n\r\n\"You knows, Marse Robert, you can't b'lieve ole Uncle Frank!\"\r\n\r\n\"Frank always knows what he is talking about! He is only more polite\r\nthan the rest of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Marse Robert, Gawd knows I hates to fling dut at Uncle Frank, but\r\nhe's a liar. He sholy is! An' jist 'cause he's a _sweet_ liar he gets\r\nwe all in trouble.\"\r\n\r\nMy father, the chaplain, soon joined us, his corps having camped within\r\nriding distance. There was an office in the yard, and there my father\r\ntook up his abode. His life was an active one among the soldiers, and\r\nhe was often absent for days at a time; but I felt the protection of\r\nhis occasional presence.\r\n\r\nMy husband was now employed, day and night, often in peril, gleaning\r\nfrom every possible source information for General Lee.\r\n\r\nOne day Theo and Roger ran in with stirring news. They had seen General\r\nLee dismount at Mr. Turnbull's, a short distance on the road beyond\r\nus, and had learned from Mr. Turnbull himself that his house had been\r\ngiven to General Lee for his headquarters, also that the General did not\r\nrequire Mr. and Mrs. Turnbull to leave, and that they were delighted to\r\nhave the General.\r\n\r\nThe whole face of the earth seemed to change immediately. Army wagons\r\ncrawled unceasingly along the highroad, just in front of our gate. All\r\nwas stir and life in the rear, where there was another country road, and\r\na short road connecting the two passed immediately by the well near our\r\nhouse. This, too, was constantly travelled; the whir of the well-wheel\r\nnever seemed to pause, day or night. We soon had pleasant visitors,\r\nGeneral A. P. Hill, Colonel William Pegram, General Walker, General\r\nWilcox, and others. General Wilcox, an old friend and comrade, craved\r\npermission to make his headquarters on the green lawn in the rear of\r\nthe house, and my husband rejoiced at his presence and protection for\r\nour little family.\r\n\r\nIn less than twenty-four hours I found myself in the centre of a camp.\r\nThe white tents of General Wilcox's staff officers were stretched close\r\nto the door.\r\n\r\nWhen we left Washington, our library and pictures had been sent to\r\nPetersburg, and had remained there in a warehouse ever since. My father\r\neagerly advised us to set up the library and hang the pictures in our\r\nnew home at Cottage Farm.\r\n\r\n\"But suppose General Lee moves away,\" I suggested.\r\n\r\n\"My dear, he will not move away! He is here to protect Petersburg and\r\nRichmond. He will never surrender either place—and, as I have tried to\r\nimpress upon you, the safest place for you on this continent is in the\r\nrear of Lee's army.\"\r\n\r\nSo timber was brought for shelving the dining room, and three thousand\r\nor more books were arranged on the shelves. The parlor and the two\r\nbedrooms (we had no more in the little cottage) were hung with the\r\npictures bought by my husband when he was Minister to Greece. My\r\nfavorite—the Raffaello Morghen proof impression of the \"Madonna della\r\nSeggiola\"—hung over the mantel in the parlor, and to it I lifted weary\r\neyes many a time during the remaining days of the war. Sundry delicate\r\ncarvings were also in the boxes, with my music. My sister had not\r\ntaken her piano with her to North Carolina. There were a baby-house and\r\ntoys in another box, and in a French trunk with many compartments some\r\nevening dresses, at which I did not even glance, well knowing I should\r\nnot need them. The trunk containing them was stored in the cellar.\r\n\r\nWe were happier than we had been for a long time. Things seemed to\r\npromise a little respite. To be sure, Grant's army was in front of us;\r\nbut if we could only avoid a collision for a month or two, the troops\r\non both sides would go into winter quarters, and everybody would have\r\nthe rest so much needed to fit them for the spring campaign.\r\n\r\n\"We are here for eight years,—not a day less,\" said my father, and he\r\nfully believed it.\r\n\r\nThat being the case, it behooved me to look after the little boys'\r\neducation. School books were found for them. I knew \"small Latin and\r\nless Greek,\" but I gravely heard them recite lessons in the former;\r\nand they never discovered the midnight darkness of my mind as to\r\nmathematics.\r\n\r\nI knew nothing of the strong line of fortifications which General Grant\r\nwas building at the back of the farm, fortifications strengthened by\r\nforts at short intervals. Our own line—visible from the garden—had fewer\r\nforts, two of which, Fort Gregg and Battery 45, protected our immediate\r\nneighborhood. These forts occasionally answered a challenge, but there\r\nwas no attempt at a sally on either side.\r\n\r\nThe most painful circumstance connected with our position was the picket\r\nfiring at night, incessant, like the dropping of hail, and harrowing\r\nfrom the apprehension that many a man fell from the fire of a picket.\r\nBut, perhaps to reassure me, Captain Lindsay and Captain Glover of\r\nGeneral Wilcox's staff declared that \"pickets have a good time. They\r\nfire, yes, for that is their business; but while they load for the next\r\nvolley, one will call out, 'Hello, Reb,' be answered, 'Hello, Yank,'\r\nand little parcels of coffee are thrown across in exchange for a plug\r\nof tobacco.\" After accepting this fiction I could sleep better.\r\n\r\nNothing could better illustrate the fact that this war was not a war of\r\nthe men at the guns, than one of General John B. Gordon's anecdotes.[19]\r\n\r\nA short distance from Blandford was the strong work on the Federal line\r\ncalled Fort Steadman. It was determined to take this by assault. There\r\nwere obstructions in front of our lines which had to be removed. The\r\nlines were so close this could only be done under cover of darkness.\r\nThen there were obstructions to be removed from the front of Fort\r\nSteadman, and an immediate rush to be made before the gunners could\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nThis delicate and hazardous duty was successfully performed by General\r\nGordon, near the close of the war, and was the last time the stars and\r\nbars were carried to aggressive assault.\r\n\r\nAbout four o'clock in the morning our axemen were quietly at work on our\r\nobstacle when the unavoidable noise attracted the notice of a Federal\r\npicket. In the black darkness he called out:—\r\n\r\n\"Hello there, Johnny Reb! What are you making all that fuss about over\r\nthere?\"\r\n\r\nOur men were leaning forward for the start, and General Gordon was for\r\na moment disconcerted; but a rifleman answered in a cheerful voice:—\r\n\r\n\"Oh, never mind us, Yank! Lie down and go to sleep! We are just\r\ngathering a little corn; you know rations are mighty short over here!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a patch of corn between the lines, some still hanging on the\r\nstalks. After a few moments there came back the kindly reply of the\r\nYankee picket:—\r\n\r\n\"All right, Johnny, go ahead and get your corn. I won't shoot at you.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Gordon was about to give the command to go forward, when\r\nthe rifleman showed some compunctions of conscience for having used\r\ndeception which might result in the picket's death, by calling out\r\nloudly:—\r\n\r\n\"Look out for yourself now, Yank! We're going to shell the woods.\"\r\n\r\nSuch exhibitions of true kindness and comradeship were not uncommon\r\nduring the war.\r\n\r\nOn a hill a short distance off was the farmhouse of \"old Billy Green,\"\r\nas he was known to his neighbors. He had a good wife, kind to me and to\r\neverybody, and a fine-looking, amiable daughter, Nannie Green. These\r\nwere my only female acquaintances. Nannie soon became an out-and-out\r\nbelle—the only young lady in the neighborhood. Tender songs were\r\nparaphrased in her honor; Ben Bolt's Sweet Alice became \"Sweet Nannie,\"\r\nand \"Sweet Annie of the Vale\" easily became \"Sweet Nannie of the Hill.\"\r\nI was very stern with the young officers around me, about Nannie Green.\r\nShe was a modest, dignified girl, and I did not intend to have her\r\nspoiled, nor her father ridiculed.\r\n\r\nI found some cut-glass champagne glasses in one of my boxes. Every night\r\na request would come from Captain Lindsay, or Captain Glover, or some\r\nother of my staff tenants, for a champagne glass. At last I asked:—\r\n\r\n\"Why do you limit yourselves to one glass?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we don't drink from it. We have no wine, you know.\"\r\n\r\nIt appeared upon investigation that they cut profile pictures of Nannie\r\nGreen out of paper, laid this cut paper on another, weighting it down\r\nwith bullets, and turned the glass over it. As they sat around the\r\ntable smoking, each one would lift a little edge of the glass and blow\r\nthe smoke under it, shutting down quickly. When the smoking was over,\r\nand glass and paper were lifted, there was a pure white silhouette of\r\nNannie's face on an amber-colored background, cameo-like in effect. The\r\nface would be delicately shaded, soulful eyes added, and—_voilà_!\r\n\r\n\"Why was I not to know this?\" I asked sternly.\r\n\r\n\"Because we feared you would lend us no more glasses.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it appears you all have a young lady's picture without her consent?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" they pleaded. \"Isn't she perfectly welcome to ours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you expect her to exchange, for something she doesn't want,\r\nsomething which you _do_ want?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we think she might,\" said one, ruefully. \"If her shadow can\r\ncomfort a poor fellow's cold and lonely evening, she might spare it.\r\nShe can't possibly miss it.\"\r\n\r\nI never refused to lend them the glasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nARRIVING AT EXTREMITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nMy husband's duties kept him from home several days at a time during\r\nthe early autumn, but now that the lines were drawn so closely together,\r\nhe could usually return to us after reporting to General Lee at night.\r\nI had ceased to feel anxious when he rode away in the morning on his\r\ngray horse, Jubal Early. Jubal had brought him safely through many a\r\ndifficulty. Once he found himself suddenly confronted by a small company\r\nof Federals aligned for drill. He saluted, as if he were an officer\r\non inspection, rode gravely past the line, and then Jubal's fleet feet\r\ndashed quite out of range before the volley which followed the discovery\r\nof his ruse.\r\n\r\nOne frosty morning I was writing letters,—to Agnes, to my mother, to my\r\nlittle girls in Charlotte, expressing the gratitude of my heart for the\r\nnew blessings of the hour,—when General Wilcox entered, and took his\r\naccustomed stand before the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" he commenced, \"is the General at home?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, General, he did not return last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not uneasy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit. He sometimes stops at Mrs. Friend's when he is belated.\r\nShe's his cousin, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course!\" laughed the General. \"All the pretty women in Virginia\r\nare cousins to the Virginia officers. Couldn't you naturalize a few\r\nunfortunates who were not born in Virginia?\"\r\n\r\nI was sealing and stamping my letters, and looked up without immediately\r\nanswering his badinage. To my surprise his face was pale and his lip\r\nquivering.\r\n\r\n\"You have to know it,\" said he. \"The General will not return. The\r\nYankees caught him this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, impossible!\" I exclaimed. \"Jubal never fails.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look out of the window,\" said the general.\r\n\r\nThere stood Jubal! A groom was removing his saddle. General Wilcox most\r\nkindly hastened to reassure me. \"It will be all right,\" he declared. \"A\r\nlittle rest for the General, and we will soon exchange him.\"\r\n\r\nI was completely stunned. I had never expected this. My head reeled. My\r\nheart sickened within me.\r\n\r\nAs I sat thus, shivering beside the fire, I heard the clank of spurs,\r\nand looked up. An officer was at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" he said, \"General Lee sends you his affectionate sympathies.\"\r\n\r\nThrough the open window I saw the General on his horse, Traveller,\r\nstanding at the well. He waited until his messenger returned, and then\r\nrode slowly toward the lines.\r\n\r\nI had small hope of the speedy exchange promised me by General Wilcox.\r\nFrom day to day he reported the efforts made for my husband's release\r\nand their failure. General Lee authorized a letter to General Meade,\r\ndetailing the circumstances of his capture and requesting his release.\r\nGeneral Meade promptly refused to release him.\r\n\r\nWe naturally looked to the enemy for all information, and although my\r\nhusband had written me a pencilled note at City Point on the inside\r\nof a Confederate envelope, and had implored his guard (a Federal\r\nofficer) to have it inserted in a New York paper, I did not receive it\r\nuntil thirty-one years afterward. We soon had news, however, through a\r\ndespatch from the North Army Corps to the _New York Herald_. The paper\r\nof November 30, 1864, contained the following:—\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday a rebel officer made his appearance in front of our\r\nlines, waving a paper for exchange. The officer in charge of the\r\npicket, suddenly remembering that Major Burrage, of the Thirty-sixth\r\nMassachusetts, was taken prisoner some time since by the enemy while\r\non a similar errand, 'gobbled' the rebel, who proved to be the famous\r\nRoger A. Pryor, ex-member of Congress and ex-brigadier-general of Jeff\r\nDavis's army. He protested vehemently against what he styled a flagrant\r\nbreach of faith on our part. He was assured he was taken in retaliation\r\nfor like conduct on the part of his friends, and sent to General Meade's\r\nheadquarters for further disposition.\"\r\n\r\nPress despatch to _Herald_, November 30, from Washington, \"Roger A.\r\nPryor has been brought to Washington, and committed to the old Capitol\r\nPrison.\"\r\n\r\n_Herald_, December 1, 1864, \"Pryor was ferried over to Fort Lafayette,\r\nwhere he is now confined.\"\r\n\r\nThen later I received a personal through _The News_: \"To Mrs. R. A.\r\nPryor. Your husband is in Fort Lafayette, where a friend and relative\r\nis permitted to visit him.—[Signed] MARY RHODES.\"\r\n\r\nNot until December, 1864, could Colonel Ould arrange to have a letter\r\nfrom me sent through the lines. All letters from and to prisoners were\r\nexamined by Federal officials.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of December I received a brief note from Fort Lafayette:\r\n\"My philosophy begins to fail somewhat. In vain I seek some argument\r\nof consolation. I see no chance of release. The conditions of my\r\nimprisonment cut me off from every resource of happiness.\"\r\n\r\nI learned afterward that he was ill, and under the care of a physician\r\nall winter, but he tried to write as encouragingly as possible.\r\nIn February, however, he failed in health and spirits, but bore up\r\nbravely:—\r\n\r\n\"I am as contented as is compatible with my condition. My mind is\r\nill at ease from my solicitude for my family and my country. Every\r\ndisaster pierces my soul like an arrow; and I am afflicted with the\r\nthought that I am denied the privilege of contributing even my mite\r\nto the deliverance of ——. How I envy my old comrades their hardships\r\nand privations. I have little hope of an early exchange, and you may\r\nbe assured my mistrust is not without reason. _Except some special\r\ninstance be employed to procure my release, my detention here will be\r\nindefinite._ I cannot be more explicit. While this is my conviction,\r\nI wish it distinctly understood that I would not have my government\r\ncompromise any scruple for the sake of my liberation. I am prepared for\r\nany contingency—am fortified against any reverse of fortune.\"\r\n\r\nThe problem now confronting me was this: How could I maintain my\r\nchildren and myself? My husband's rations were discontinued. My only\r\nsupply of food was from my father's ration as chaplain. I had a part\r\nof a barrel of flour which a relative had sent me from a county now cut\r\noff from us. Quite a number of my old Washington servants had followed\r\nme, to escape the shelling, but they could not, of course, look to\r\nme for their support. I frankly told John and Eliza my condition,\r\nbut they elected to remain. One day John presented himself with a\r\nheart-broken countenance and a drooping attitude of deep dejection. He\r\nhad a sad story to tell. The agent of the estate to which he belonged\r\nwas in town, and John had been commissioned to inform me that all the\r\nslaves belonging to the estate were to be immediately transferred to\r\na Louisiana plantation for safety. Those of us who had hired these\r\nservants by the year were to be indemnified for our loss.\r\n\r\n\"How do you feel about it, John?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nThe poor fellow broke down. \"It will kill me,\" he declared. \"I'll soon\r\ndie on that plantation.\"\r\n\r\nAll his affectionate, faithful service, all his hardships for our\r\nsakes, the Averill raid, rushed upon my memory. I bade him put me in\r\ncommunication with the agent. I found that I could save the boy only by\r\nbuying him. A large sum of gold was named as the price. I unbuckled my\r\ngirdle and counted my handful of gold—one hundred and six dollars. These\r\nI offered to the agent (who was a noted negro trader), and although it\r\nwas far short of his figures, he made out my bill of sale receipted.\r\n\r\nWhen John appeared with smiling face he informed me with his thanks that\r\nhe belonged to me.\r\n\r\n\"You are a free man, John,\" I said. \"I will make out your papers and I\r\ncan very easily arrange for you to pass the lines.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that,\" he said. \"Marse Roger has often told me I was a free\r\nman. I never will leave you till I die. Papers indeed! Papers nothing!\r\nI belong to you—that's where I belong.\"\r\n\r\nAll that dreadful winter he was faithful to his promise, cheerfully\r\nbearing, without wages, all the privations of the time. Sometimes, when\r\nthe last atom of food was gone, he would ask for money, sally forth\r\nwith a horse and light cart, and bring in peas and dried apples. Once a\r\nweek we were allowed to purchase the head of a bullock, horns and all,\r\nfrom the commissary; and a small ration of rice was allowed us by the\r\ngovernment. A one-armed boy, Alick, who had been reared in my father's\r\nfamily, now wandered in to find his old master, and installed himself\r\nas my father's servant.\r\n\r\nThe question that pressed upon me day and night was: How, where, can I\r\nearn some money? to be answered by the frightful truth that there could\r\nbe no opening for me anywhere, because I could not leave my children.\r\n\r\nOne wakeful night, while I was revolving these things, a sudden thought\r\ndarted, unbidden, into my sorely oppressed mind:—\r\n\r\n\"Why not open the trunk from Washington? Something may be found there\r\nwhich can be sold.\"\r\n\r\nAt an early hour next morning John and Alick brought the trunk from the\r\ncellar. Aunt Jinny, Eliza, and the children gathered around. It proved\r\nto be full of my old Washington finery. There were a half-dozen or\r\nmore white muslin gowns, flounced and trimmed with Valenciennes lace,\r\nmany yards; there was a rich bayadere silk gown trimmed fully with\r\nguipure lace; a green silk dress with gold embroidery; a blue and silver\r\nbrocade,—these last evening gowns. There was a paper box containing the\r\nshaded roses I had worn to Lady Napier's ball, the ball at which Mrs.\r\nDouglas and I had dressed alike in gowns of tulle. Another box held\r\nthe garniture of green leaves and gold grapes which had belonged to\r\nthe green silk; and still another the blue and silver feathers for the\r\nbrocade. An opera cloak trimmed with fur; a long purple velvet cloak;\r\na purple velvet \"coalscuttle\" bonnet, trimmed with white roses; a point\r\nlace handkerchief; Valenciennes lace; Brussels lace; and at the bottom\r\nof the trunk a package of _ciel_ blue zephyr, awakening reminiscences\r\nof a passion which I had cherished for knitting shawls and \"mariposas\"\r\nof zephyr,—such was the collection I had discovered.\r\n\r\nThe velvet cloak had come to grief. Somebody had put the handsome books\r\nPresident Pierce had given me into this box, for special safe-keeping;\r\nand all these years the cloak had cushioned the books so that they made\r\nno inroads upon the other articles, and had given up its own life in\r\ntheir protection. Not an inch of the garment was ever fit for use. It\r\nwas generously printed all over with the large cords and tassels of its\r\nown trimming.\r\n\r\nThese were my materials. I must make them serve for the support of my\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nI ripped all the lace from the evening gowns, and made it into collars\r\nand undersleeves. John found an extinct dry-goods store where clean\r\npaper boxes could be had.\r\n\r\nMy first instalment of lace collars was sent to Price's store in\r\nRichmond and promptly sold. Mr. Price wrote me that all of my articles\r\nwould find purchasers. There were ladies in Richmond who could afford\r\nto buy, and the Confederate court offered opportunities for display.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Porter records the capture of a blockade-runner whose valuable\r\ngoods included many commissions for \"ladies at court. In the cabin of\r\nthe vessel,\" says the admiral, \"was a pile of bandboxes in which were\r\ncharming little bonnets marked with the owners' names. It would have\r\ngiven me much pleasure to have forwarded them to their destination\" (the\r\nadmiral had ever a weakness for Southern ladies) \"but the laws forbade\r\nour giving aid and comfort to the enemy, so all the French bonnets,\r\ncloaks, shoes, and other feminine _bric-à-brac_ had to go to New\r\nYork for condemnation by the Admiralty Court, and were sold at public\r\nauction.\r\n\r\n\"These bonnets, laces, and other vanities rather clashed with the idea I\r\nhad formed of the Southern ladies, as I heard that all they owned went\r\nto the hospitals, and that they never spent a cent on their personal\r\nadornment; but human nature,\" sagely opines the admiral, \"is the same\r\nthe world over, and ladies will indulge in their little vanities in\r\nspite of war and desolation.\"[20] To these vanities I now found myself\r\nindebted.\r\n\r\nThe zeal with which I worked knew no pause. I needed no rest. General\r\nWilcox, who was in the saddle until a late hour every night, said to me,\r\n\"Your candle is the last light I see at night—the first in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should never sleep,\" I told him.\r\n\r\nOne day I consulted Eliza about the manufacture of a Confederate candle.\r\nWe knew how to make it—by drawing a cotton rope many times through\r\nmelted wax, and then winding it around a bottle. We could get wax, but\r\nour position was an exposed one. Soldiers' tents were close around us,\r\nand we scrupulously avoided any revelation of our needs, lest they\r\nshould deny themselves for our sakes. Eliza thought we might avail\r\nourselves of the absence of the officers, and finish our work before\r\nthey returned. We made our candle; but that night, as I sat sewing\r\nbeside its dim, glow-worm light, I heard a step in the hall, and a hand,\r\nhastily thrust out, placed a brown paper parcel on the piano near the\r\ndoor. It was a soldier's ration of candles!\r\n\r\nAfter I had converted all my laces into collars, cuffs, and sleeves,\r\nand had sold my silk gowns, opera cloak, and point lace handkerchiefs,\r\nI devoted myself to trimming the edges of the artificial flowers, and\r\nseparating the long wreaths and garlands into clusters for hats and\r\n_bouquets de corsage_.\r\n\r\nEliza and the children delighted in this phase of my work, and begged\r\nto assist,—all except Aunt Jinny.\r\n\r\n\"Honey,\" she said, \"don't you think, in these times of trouble, you\r\nmight do better than tempt them po' young lambs in Richmond to worship\r\nthe golden calf and bow down to mammon? We prays not to be led into\r\ntemptation, and you sho'ly is leadin' 'em into vanity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe so, Aunt Jinny, but I must sell all I can. We have to be clothed,\r\nyou know, war or no war.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my chile, that's so; but we're told to consider the lilies.\r\nGawd Almighty tells us we must clothe ourselves in the garment of\r\nrighteousness, and He—\"\r\n\r\n\"You always 'pear to be mighty intimate with God A'mighty,\" interrupted\r\nEliza, in great wrath. \"Now you just go 'long home an' leave my mistis\r\nto her work. How would _you_ look with nothin' on but a garment of\r\nrighteousness?\"\r\n\r\nWhen I had stripped the pretty muslin gowns of their trimmings, what\r\ncould be done with the gowns themselves? Finally I resolved to embroider\r\nthem with the blue zephyr. I rolled the edges of the flounces, and edged\r\nthem delicately with a spiral line of blue. I traced with blue a dainty\r\nvine of forget-me-nots on bodice and sleeves, with a result that was\r\nsimply ravishing!\r\n\r\nMy first purchase was a barrel of flour, for which I paid thirteen\r\nhundred dollars. John made hot biscuits three times a day thereafter.\r\nAs the winter wore on, and the starvation became stern in the army, a\r\nsoldier would occasionally bring to the kitchen his ration of a small\r\nsquare of beef to be cooked, or _eight grains of coffee_ to trade with\r\nJohn for a few biscuits. I sternly forbade the trade, and ordered John\r\nto grind the coffee in the owner's presence, mix it with our toasted\r\ncorn, and give him the biscuits, with a good, strengthening drink.\r\nOften a brown hand would place a tiny bundle on the piano, as the donor\r\npassed through the hall, and my heart would ache to find it contained\r\na soldier's ration of coffee. My dear father had friends among his old\r\nparishioners who never allowed him to do without his coffee—a necessity\r\nfor a man who never, under any circumstances, fortified his strength\r\nwith ardent spirits. He was almost fanatical on the total abstinence\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nOf course I could not command shoes for my boys. I made them of carpet\r\nlined with flannel for my baby. I could in one day make a pair which\r\nshe wore out in three! A piece of bronze morocco fell into my hands, of\r\nwhich I made a pair of boots for my little daughter, Mary, and out of\r\nan old leather pocket-book and two or three leather bags which Alick\r\nfound in his prowling over the fields, a soldier-shoemaker contrived\r\nshoes for each of the boys.\r\n\r\nMy own prime necessity was for the steel we women wear in front of our\r\nstays. I suffered so much for want of this accustomed support, that\r\nCaptain Lindsay had a pair made for me by the government gunsmith.\r\n\r\nThe time came when the salable contents of the Washington trunk were all\r\ngone. I then cut up my husband's dress-coat, and designed well-fitting\r\nladies' gloves, with gauntlets made of the watered silk lining. Of\r\nan interlining of gray flannel I made gray gloves, and this glove\r\nmanufacture yielded me hundreds of dollars. Thirteen small fragments\r\nof flannel were left after the gloves were finished. Of these, pieced\r\ntogether, I made a pair of drawers for my Willy—my youngest boy.\r\n\r\nThe lines around us were now so closely drawn that my father returned\r\nhome after short absences of a day or two. But we were made anxious,\r\nduring a heavy snow early in December, by a more prolonged absence.\r\nFinally he appeared, on foot, hatless, and exhausted. He had been\r\ncaptured by a party of cavalrymen. He had told them of his non-combatant\r\nposition, but when he asked for release, they shook their heads. At\r\nnight they all prepared to bivouac upon the ground, assigned to him\r\na sheltered spot, gave him a good supper and blankets, and left him\r\nto his repose. As the night wore on and all grew still, he raised his\r\nhead cautiously to reconnoitre, and to his surprise found himself at\r\nsome distance from the guard—but his horse tied to a tree within the\r\ncircle around the fire. My father took the hint, and quietly walked away\r\nunchallenged. \"Which proves, my dear,\" he said, \"that a clergyman is\r\nnot worth as much as a good horse in time of war.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nA WINTER OF WANT\r\n\r\n\r\nI resolved to give my family a Christmas dinner. John invented a\r\nmethod of making a perfectly satisfactory pie out of sorghum molasses,\r\nthickened with a little flour, mixed with walnut meats, and baked in\r\na \"raised\" crust. He prepared a number of these. I bought a piece of\r\ncorned beef for fifty dollars. This was boiled with peas. But just as\r\nwe were about to gather around the table, we saw a forlorn company of\r\nsoldiers passing the door. They had gone out on some raid a week before.\r\nThe snow was falling fast, the soldiers walked wearily, with dejected\r\ncountenances. \"Boys,\" I said, \"are you willing to send the dish of beef\r\nand peas out to them?\" They agreed, if only they might carry it; and the\r\nbrave little fellows liked the pleasure they gave more than they would\r\nhave enjoyed the dinner. They were full of it for days afterward.\r\n\r\nWe had grown very fond of some of the men around us, and my boys were\r\nso rich in their companionship, that they never complained of their\r\nprivations. They were good, wholesome comrades, interested in our books\r\nand in the boys' studies. Captain Lindsay and Captain Glover of General\r\nWilcox's staff were great comforts. General A. P. Hill and Colonel\r\nWilliam Pegram came often to see us. General Lee often passed the door\r\non his way to the lines, and paused to inquire concerning our welfare.\r\nI established a little circulating library for dear Colonel Pegram and\r\nour own officers. The books were always faithfully returned, with warm\r\nthanks for the comfort they gave.\r\n\r\nThe month of January brought us sleet and storm. Our famine grew sterner\r\nevery day. Poor little Rose, my cow, could yield only one cupful of\r\nmilk, so small was her ration; but we never thought of turning the\r\nfaithful animal into beef. The officers in my yard spared her something\r\nevery day from the food of their horses.\r\n\r\nThe days were so dark and cheerless, the news from the armies at a\r\ndistance so discouraging, it was hard to preserve a cheerful demeanor\r\nfor the sake of the family. And now began the alarming tidings, every\r\nmorning, of the desertions during the night. General Wilcox wondered\r\nhow long his brigade would hold together at the rate of fifty desertions\r\nevery twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe common soldier had enlisted, not to establish the right of\r\nsecession, not for love of the slave,—he had no slaves,—but simply\r\nto resist the invasion of the South by the North, simply to prevent\r\nsubjugation. The soldier of the rank and file was not always\r\nintellectual or cultivated. He cared little for politics, less for\r\nslavery. He did care, however, for his own soil, his own little farm,\r\nhis own humble home; and he was willing to fight to drive the invader\r\nfrom it. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation did not stimulate him in\r\nthe least. The negro, free or slave, was of no consequence to him. His\r\nquarrel was a sectional one, and he fought for his section.\r\n\r\nIn any war, the masses rarely trouble themselves about the merits of\r\nthe quarrel. Their pugnacity and courage are aroused and stimulated by\r\nthe enthusiasm of their comrades, or by their own personal wrongs and\r\nperils.\r\n\r\nNow, in January, 1865, the common soldier perceived that the cause was\r\nlost. He could read its doom in the famine around him, in the faces\r\nof his officers, in tidings from abroad. His wife and children were\r\nsuffering. His duty was now to them; so he stole away in the darkness,\r\nand, in infinite danger and difficulty, found his way back to his own\r\nfireside. He deserted, but not to the enemy.\r\n\r\nBut what can we say of the soldier who remained unflinchingly at his\r\npost _knowing_ the cause was lost for which he was called to meet death?\r\nHeroism can attain no loftier height than this.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Napier,[21] in his campaign against the robber tribes of\r\nUpper Scinde, found that the hills-men had a custom of binding, with a\r\nscarlet thread, the wrist of a leader who fell after some distinguished\r\nact of courage. They thus honored the hand that had wielded a valiant\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nA party of eleven English soldiers were once separated from their\r\nfellows, and mistook a signal for an order to charge. The brave fellows\r\nanswered with a cheer. On a summit in front of them was a breastwork\r\nmanned by seventy of the foe. On they went, charging up the fearful\r\npath, eleven against seventy. There could be but one result. When their\r\ncomrades arrived to aid them, every one of the British soldiers was\r\ndead—and around _both_ wrists of every one was twined the red thread!\r\n\r\nAnd so I am sure that to every man who fell in that last hopeless fight,\r\nour brave foes will award the red badge of honor—as our own hearts will\r\never strive to deserve it for their sakes.\r\n\r\nThe horror of military execution was now upon us. Nothing so distressed\r\nmy father and myself. Finally General Lee offered the men who had\r\ndeserted a last opportunity to wipe out their disgrace and escape the\r\npunishment of their crimes. He granted, by authority of the government,\r\namnesty to those who would report to the nearest officer on duty within\r\ntwenty days, thus giving them the privilege of reëntering the service\r\nin companies where they would not be known.\r\n\r\n\"Let us,\" said the general, \"oppose constancy to adversity, fortitude\r\nto suffering, and courage to danger, with the firm assurance that He who\r\ngave freedom to our fathers will bless the efforts of their children to\r\npreserve it.\"\r\n\r\nAlas! few availed themselves of this solemn appeal to their manhood.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we received occasional letters from our prisoner in Fort\r\nLafayette. He was confined in a casemate with about twenty men. A small\r\ngrate for burning coal sufficed for the preparation of their rations,\r\nwhich were issued to them raw. They lay upon straw mats on the floor.\r\nOnce daily they could walk upon the ramparts, and my husband's eyes\r\nturned sadly to the dim outlines of the beautiful city where he had\r\noften been an honored guest. The veil which hid from him so much of\r\nthe grief and struggle of the future hid also the reward. Little did\r\nhe dream he should administer justice on the supreme bench of the\r\nmist-veiled city.\r\n\r\nHis letters bore but one theme, his earnest prayer for exchange, so that\r\nhe might do his part in our defence.\r\n\r\nOne night all these things weighed more heavily than usual upon me,—the\r\npicket firing, the famine, the military executions, the dear one \"sick\r\nand in prison.\" I sighed audibly, and my son, Theodorick, who slept near\r\nme, asked the cause, adding, \"Why can you not sleep, dear mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" I replied, \"you repeat something for me.\"\r\n\r\nHe at once commenced, \"Tell me not in mournful numbers\"—and repeated\r\nthe \"Psalm of Life.\" I did not sleep; those brave words were not strong\r\nenough for the situation.\r\n\r\nHe paused, and presently his young voice broke the stillness:—\r\n\r\n\"Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless His holy\r\nname\"—going on to the end of the beautiful psalm of adoration and faith\r\nwhich nineteen centuries have decreed to be in very truth a Psalm of\r\nLife.\r\n\r\nI felt great responsibility in keeping with me my sons, now ten and\r\ntwelve years old. At a farmhouse about fifteen miles in the country a\r\nmember of the family was living, and availing myself of a passing wagon,\r\nI sent the boys to share his plenty and comfort. A few days afterwards\r\nthey returned—a dusty, footsore pair of urchins. They had run away and\r\ncome home! Moreover, they had found an old horse left on the roadside\r\nto die,—which Roger refused to leave,—had shared their luncheon with\r\nhim, given him water, assisted him to his feet, and by slow stages led\r\nhim home!\r\n\r\n\"Oh! _how_ shall we feed him?\" I exclaimed, in despair.\r\n\r\n\"I'll help,\" said Captain Lindsay; \"he shall be immediately introduced\r\nto my mare, and she shall share her oats with him;\" and a very\r\nsober-minded, steady horse he proved to be, quite good enough to be\r\nstolen, as he finally was, by the enemy.\r\n\r\nMy friend, General Wilcox, put my own friendship to a severe test\r\none morning. Standing by the mantel in his accustomed attitude,\r\nhe informed me that he had received many kind attentions from the\r\nladies of Petersburg (I was aware of an affair of the heart in which\r\na pretty widow was concerned), and he proposed to give a _déjeuner à\r\nla fourchette_, and invite them out to his tent. Would I chaperon the\r\noccasion, and might my parlor be used as a reception room?\r\n\r\n\"Of course, General!\" I replied. \"They will be welcome to me, and to the\r\nparlor. The '_fourchette_' will be forthcoming without fail, but where,\r\noh, where can we find the '_déjeuner_'?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have thought of all that,\" said the General. \"I will send half a\r\ndozen fellows out with guns to bring in birds. I'll get John to make\r\nsome cakes and biscuits, we'll brew a bowl of punch. _Voilà!_ What more\r\ndo you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"That will be fine,\" I assured him, and accordingly his invitations were\r\nsent, handsomely written, to about thirty people. A load of evergreens\r\nwas delivered at the tent, and all hands set to work to weave garlands.\r\nEvery candle in camp was \"pressed.\" John made a fine success of his\r\nsponge cakes, and also fruit and nut cake—the fruit, disguised dried\r\napples, the nuts, walnuts.\r\n\r\nThe day before the event the General leaned, a dejected figure, against\r\nthe mantel.\r\n\r\n\"Those—blamed—soldiers have returned. They didn't bag a bird.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feared that! Virginia partridges are hunted with dogs. Besides, where\r\ncan you find game within twenty miles of an army?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it will take six months' pay, but we must buy oysters. I don't\r\nknow what else we can do.\"\r\n\r\n\"General,\" I said, \"suppose you have a breakfast like one Mrs. ——, from\r\nNorth Carolina, gave here when she stayed with me last month. She had\r\nlittle _ménus_ neatly written, including various dishes. The dishes,\r\nhowever, were imaginary. They did not appear! The guests left with the\r\nimpression that these things had been provided, but that accidents which\r\nwere to be counted on in time of war had spoiled them. Now, John could\r\neasily announce a fall of soot from the chimney,—like Caleb Balderstone!\r\nAunt Jinny would make an admirable 'Mysie.' Have you never heard her\r\n'skirl'? We might imagine partridges, turkey, and ham, and then imagine\r\nthe accidents. What could be simpler?\"\r\n\r\nThe General's breakfast was a great success. The weather was fine. One\r\nof his staff, who was not invited, confided to me his fear that there\r\nwould be nothing left! And, indeed, the guests brought noble appetites.\r\nThe General took in the pretty widow. General A. P. Hill honored me. A\r\ngay procession of open wagons filled with merry guests left the door at\r\nsunset, and sang \"The Bonnie Blue Flag\" as they wended their way home.\r\nGeneral Lee from his headquarters could hear the song, and doubtless it\r\ncheered his sympathetic heart, albeit he knew a battle was near at hand.\r\nHe could not know that in that battle General Hill and Colonel Pegram\r\nwould fall with all their wounds in front, among the first of those\r\nmartyrs whose lives were sacrificed after the leaders _knew_ there was\r\nno more life in the cause for which they died.\r\n\r\nOur friends in town sent many invitations to us dwellers in tents. Of\r\ncourse, I accepted none of them. I had no heart for gayety, and not\r\none moment's time to spare from my sewing. It is passing strange—this\r\ndisposition to revel in times of danger and suffering. Florence was\r\nnever so gay as during the Plague! The men of our army who had been\r\nabsent three years were now near their homes, and they abandoned\r\nthemselves to the opportunities of the hour. Some of them were engaged\r\nto the beautiful young women of Petersburg. \"This is no time for\r\nmarriage,\" said General Lee, \"no time while the country is in such\r\nperil;\" and yet he granted a furlough now and then to some soldier who\r\nwas unwilling to wait.\r\n\r\nThere were parties, \"starvation parties,\" as they were called on\r\naccount of the absence of refreshments impossible to be obtained. Not\r\neven the lump of sugar allowed by Lady Morgan at her _conversaziones_\r\nwas possible here; but notwithstanding this serious disadvantage, ball\r\nfollowed ball in quick succession. \"The soldier danced with the lady\r\nof his love at night, and on the morrow danced the dance of death in\r\nthe deadly trench on the line.\" There the ranks closed up; and in the\r\nball room they closed up also. There was always a comrade left for the\r\npartner of the belle; and not one whit less valiant was the soldier\r\nfor his brief respite. He could go from the dance to his place in the\r\ntrenches with a light jest, however heavy his heart might be. And when\r\nthe beloved commander ordered him forth, he could step out with martial\r\ntread and cheer and song—to the march or into battle. I think all who\r\nremember the dark days of the winter of 1864-1865 will bear witness to\r\nthe unwritten law enforcing cheerfulness. It was tacitly understood that\r\nwe must make no moan, yield to no outward expression of despondency or\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nOn January 30 General Wilcox came in, bringing great news. Three\r\ncommissioners authorized to meet representatives of the Federal\r\ngovernment had arrived in Petersburg _en route_ for Fortress Monroe.\r\nThey were Vice-President Stephens, Senator R. M. T. Hunter, and James\r\nA. Campbell, former Assistant Justice of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates, and now Assistant Secretary of War of the Confederate States.\r\n\r\n\"I thought,\" said the General, \"you might come out and listen to the\r\ncheering. It is echoed by the enemy. There seems to be no doubt of the\r\nfeeling on both sides.\"\r\n\r\nI begged the General to lend me an ambulance, and drove out to the\r\nfront. The troops of Fort Gregg and Battery 45—just in the rear of my\r\ngarden—had come out and were cheering vociferously. There seemed to be\r\na truce for the moment. We could distinctly hear the answering cheers\r\nfrom the opposing fortifications.\r\n\r\nMy ambulance drew up to the side of the road, and presently an open\r\ncarriage appeared, with the mayor and the three commissioners. They\r\npaused for a few minutes before crossing the line. With my heart beating\r\npainfully, I left my ambulance and walked to the carriage. There Mr.\r\nHunter greeted me kindly and introduced me to his companions. Trembling\r\nwith emotion, I said:—\r\n\r\n\"My errand is to you, dear Mr. Hunter. You are going to see President\r\nLincoln or his representative. I entreat you, I implore you, to remember\r\nyour friend General Pryor. He is breaking his heart in prison. Beg his\r\nrelease from Mr. Lincoln.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will—we will,\" they promised. The carriage proceeded, and as it\r\ncrossed the line a mighty cheer went up from the hundreds of soldiers,\r\nConfederate and Union, who were standing on duty and looking on.\r\n\r\nIn an instant we were enemies again, and I was hastening out of the\r\nrange of shot and shell.\r\n\r\nOn February 5 the commissioners returned from their bootless errand.\r\nMr. Hunter wrote me that they had \"remembered Pryor as was promised,\r\nbut his release would not be considered.\"\r\n\r\nAn extract from Order No. 2, February 11, 1865, from General Lee,\r\nexplains the manner in which our proposals had been received:—\r\n\r\n\"The choice between war and abject submission is before us.\r\n\r\n\"To such a proposal, brave men, with arms in their hands, can have but\r\none answer.\r\n\r\n\"They cannot barter manhood for peace, nor the right of self-government\r\nfor life or property.\r\n\r\n\"Taking new resolution from the fate which our enemies intend for us,\r\nlet every man devote all his energies to the common defence.\"\r\n\r\nI am afraid we were too faint from want of food to be as courageous as\r\nour noble commander expected. Flour was now selling for $1500 a barrel;\r\nbacon, $20 a pound; beef, $15 ditto: butter could be had at $20 a pound.\r\nOne chicken could be bought for $50. Shad sold for $50 a pair (before\r\nthe war the price was not more than ten or fifteen cents). One hundred\r\ndollars was asked for one dollar in gold, making the price I had given\r\nto save John from a negro trader $10,600!—news which he heard with such\r\nconcern that I hastened to tell him I had never regretted it.\r\n\r\nJohn bethought himself of the fishes in the pond and streams, but not\r\na fish-hook was for sale in Richmond or Petersburg. He contrived, out\r\nof a cunning arrangement of pins, to make hooks, and sallied forth\r\nwith my boys. But the water was too cold, or the fish had been driven\r\ndown-stream by the firing. The usual resource of the sportsman with an\r\nempty creel—a visit to the fishmonger—was quite out of the question.\r\nThere was no fishmonger any more.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances you may imagine my sensations at receiving\r\nthe following note:—\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR MRS. PRYOR: General Lee has been honored by a visit\r\n     from the Hon. Thomas Connolly, Irish M.P. from Donegal.\r\n\r\n     \"He ventures to request you will have the kindness to give Mr.\r\n     Connolly a room in your cottage, if this can be done without\r\n     inconvenience to yourself.\"\r\n\r\nCertainly I could give Mr. Connolly a room; but just as certainly I\r\ncould not feed him! The messenger who brought the note hastily reassured\r\nme. He had been instructed to say that Mr. Connolly would mess with\r\nGeneral Lee. I turned Mr. Connolly's room over to John, who soon became\r\ndevoted to his service. The M.P. proved a most agreeable guest, a\r\nfine-looking Irish gentleman with an irresistibly humorous, cheery fund\r\nof talk. He often dropped in at our biscuit toasting, and assured us\r\nthat we were better provided than the commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\n\"You should have seen 'Uncle Robert's' dinner to-day, Madam! He had two\r\nbiscuits, and he gave me one.\"\r\n\r\nAnother time Mr. Connolly was in high feather.\r\n\r\n\"We had a glorious dinner to-day! Somebody sent 'Uncle Robert' a box of\r\nsardines.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee, however, was not forgotten. On fine mornings quite a\r\nprocession of little negroes, in every phase of raggedness, used to\r\npass my door, each one bearing a present from the farmers' wives of\r\nbuttermilk in a tin pail, for General Lee. The army was threatened\r\nwith scurvy, and buttermilk, hominy, and every vegetable that could be\r\nobtained was sent to the hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. Connolly interested himself in my boys' Latin studies.\r\n\r\n\"I am going home,\" he said, \"and tell the English women what I have seen\r\nhere: two boys reading Cæsar while the shells are thundering, and their\r\nmother looking on without fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am too busy keeping the wolf from my door,\" I told him, \"to concern\r\nmyself with the thunderbolts.\"\r\n\r\nThe wolf was no longer at the door! He had entered and had taken up\r\nhis abode at the fireside. Besides what I could earn with my needle, I\r\nhad only my father's army ration to rely upon. My faithful John foraged\r\nright and left, and I had reason to doubt the wisdom of inquiring too\r\nclosely as to the source of an occasional half-dozen eggs or small bag\r\nof corn. This last he would pound on a wooden block for hominy. Meal\r\nwas no longer procurable. As I have said, we might occasionally purchase\r\nfor five dollars the head of a bullock from the commissary, every other\r\npart of the animal being available for army rations. By self-denial on\r\nour own part, we fondly hoped we could support our army and at last win\r\nour cause. We were not, at the time, fully aware of the true state of\r\nthings. Our men were so depleted from starvation that the most trifling\r\nwound would end fatally. Gangrene would supervene, and then nothing\r\ncould be done to prevent death. Long before this time, at Vicksburg,\r\nAdmiral Porter found that many a dead soldier's haversack yielded\r\nnothing but a handful of parched corn. _We_ were now enduring a sterner\r\nsiege.\r\n\r\nBefore daylight, on the 2d of March, General Lee sent for General\r\nGordon, who was with his command at a distant part of the line.[22]\r\nUpon arriving, General Gordon was much affected by seeing General Lee\r\nstanding at the mantel in his room, his head bowed on his folded arms.\r\nThe room was dimly lighted by a single lamp, and a smouldering fire was\r\ndying on the hearth. The night was cold and General Lee's room chill\r\nand cheerless.\r\n\r\n\"I have sent for you, General Gordon,\" said General Lee, with a dejected\r\nvoice and manner, \"to make known to you the condition of our affairs\r\nand consult with you as to what we had best do. I have here reports\r\nsent in from my officers to-night. I find I have under my command, of\r\nall arms, hardly forty-five thousand men. These men are starving. They\r\nare already so weakened as to be hardly efficient. Many of them have\r\nbecome desperate, reckless, and disorderly as they have never been\r\nbefore. It is difficult to control men who are suffering for food.\r\nThey are breaking open mills, barns, and stores in search of it. Almost\r\ncrazed from hunger, they are deserting in large numbers and going home.\r\nMy horses are in equally bad condition. The supply of horses in the\r\ncountry is exhausted. It has come to be just as bad for me to have a\r\nhorse killed as a man. I cannot remount a cavalryman whose horse dies.\r\nGeneral Grant can mount ten thousand men in ten days and move around\r\nyour flank. If he were to send me word to-morrow that I might move out\r\nunmolested, I have not enough horses to move my artillery. He is not\r\nlikely to send me any such message, although he sent me word yesterday\r\nthat he knew what I had for breakfast every morning. I sent him word I\r\ndid not think that this could be so, for if he did he would surely send\r\nme something better.\r\n\r\n\"But now let us look at the figures. As I said, I have forty-five\r\nthousand starving men. Hancock has eighteen thousand at Winchester.\r\nTo oppose him I have not a single vidette. Sheridan, with his terrible\r\ncavalry, has marched unmolested and unopposed along the James, cutting\r\nthe railroads and the canal. Thomas is coming from Knoxville with thirty\r\nthousand well-equipped troops, and I have, to oppose him, not more than\r\nthree thousand in all. Sherman is in North Carolina with sixty-five\r\nthousand men.... So I have forty-five thousand poor fellows in bad\r\ncondition opposed to one hundred and sixty thousand strong and confident\r\nmen. These forces, added to General Grant's, make over a quarter of a\r\nmillion. To prevent them all from uniting to my destruction, and adding\r\nJohnston's and Beauregard's men, I can oppose only sixty thousand men.\r\nThey are growing weaker every day. Their sufferings are terrible and\r\nexhausting. My horses are broken down and impotent. General Grant may\r\npress around our flank any day and cut off our supplies.\"\r\n\r\nAs a result of this conference General Lee went to Richmond to make one\r\nmore effort to induce our government to treat for peace. It was on his\r\nreturn from an utterly fruitless errand that he said:—\r\n\r\n\"I am a soldier! It is my duty to obey orders;\" and the final disastrous\r\nbattles were fought.\r\n\r\nIt touches me to know now that it was after this that my beloved\r\ncommander found heart to turn aside and bring me comfort. No one knew\r\nbetter than he all I had endeavored and endured, and my heart blesses\r\nhis memory for its own sake. At this tremendous moment, when he had\r\nreturned from his fruitless mission to Richmond, when the attack on\r\nFort Steadman was impending, when his slender line was confronted by\r\nGrant's ever increasing host, stretching twenty miles, when the men were\r\nso starved, so emaciated, that the smallest wound meant death, when his\r\nown personal privations were beyond imagination, General Lee could spend\r\nhalf an hour for my consolation and encouragement.\r\n\r\nCottage Farm being on the road between headquarters and Fort Gregg—the\r\nfortification which held General Grant in check at that point—I saw\r\nGeneral Lee almost daily going to this work, or to \"Battery 45.\" On\r\nSundays he regularly passed on his famous horse, Traveller, on his way\r\nto a little wooden chapel, going often through sleet and rain, bending\r\nhis head to shield his face from the storm.\r\n\r\nI was, as was my custom, sewing in my little parlor one morning, about\r\nthe middle of March, when an orderly entered, saying:—\r\n\r\n\"General Lee wishes to make his respects to Mrs. Pryor.\" The General\r\nwas immediately behind him. His face was lighted with the anticipation\r\nof telling me his good news. With the high-bred courtesy and kindness\r\nwhich always distinguished his manner, he asked kindly after my welfare,\r\nand, taking my little girl in his arms, began gently to break his news\r\nto me:—\r\n\r\n\"How long, Madam, was General Pryor with me before he had a furlough?\"\r\n\r\n\"He never had one, I think,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"Well, did I not take good care of him until we camped here so close to\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" I said, puzzled to know the drift of these preliminaries.\r\n\r\n\"I sent him home to you, I remember,\" he continued, \"for a day or two,\r\nand you let the Yankees catch him. Now he is coming back to be with you\r\nagain on parole until he is exchanged. You must take better care of him\r\nin future.\"\r\n\r\nI was too much overcome to do more than stammer a few words of thanks.\r\n\r\nPresently he added, \"What are you going to say when I tell the General\r\nthat in all this winter you have never once been to see me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, General Lee,\" I answered, \"I had too much mercy to join in your\r\nbuttermilk persecution!\"\r\n\r\n\"Persecution!\" he said; \"such things keep us alive! Last night, when\r\nI reached my headquarters, I found a card on my table with a hyacinth\r\npinned to it, and these words: 'for General Lee, with a kiss!' Now,\" he\r\nadded, tapping his breast, \"I have here my hyacinth and my card—_and I\r\nmean to find my kiss_!\"\r\n\r\nHe was amused by the earnest eyes of my little girl, as she gazed into\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n\"They have a wonderful liking for soldiers,\" he said. \"I knew one little\r\ngirl to give up all her pretty curls willingly, that she might look\r\nlike Custis! 'They _might_ cut my hair like Custis's,' she said. Custis!\r\nwhose shaven head does not improve him in any eyes but hers.\"\r\n\r\nHis manner was the perfection of repose and simplicity. As he talked\r\nwith me I remembered that I had heard of this singular calmness. Even\r\nat Gettysburg, and at the explosion of the crater, he had evinced no\r\nagitation or dismay. I did not know then, as I do now, that nothing had\r\never approached the anguish of this moment, when he had come to say an\r\nencouraging and cheering word to me, after abandoning all hope of the\r\nsuccess of the cause.\r\n\r\nAfter talking awhile and sending a kind message to my husband, to greet\r\nhim on his return, he rose, walked to the window, and looked over the\r\nfields—the fields through which, not many days afterward, he dug his\r\nlast trenches!\r\n\r\nI was moved to say, \"You only, General, can tell me if it is worth my\r\nwhile to put the ploughshare into those fields.\"\r\n\r\n\"Plant your seeds, Madam,\" he replied; sadly adding, after a moment,\r\n\"the doing it will be some reward.\"\r\n\r\nI was answered. I thought then he had little hope. I now know he had\r\nnone.\r\n\r\nHe had already, as we have seen, remonstrated against further\r\nresistance—against the useless shedding of blood. His protest had been\r\nunheeded. It remained for him now to gather his forces for endurance to\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\nTwenty days afterward his headquarters were in ashes; he had led his\r\nfamished army across the Appomattox; and, telling them they had done\r\ntheir duty, and had nothing to regret, he had bidden them farewell\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE EVACUATION OF PETERSBURG\r\n\r\n\r\nThe happy day was not distant when the husband and father of our little\r\nfamily was to be restored to his own home and his own people.\r\n\r\nI never inquired the source from which John drew his materials for a\r\nfestival; but, a day or two before my husband was to arrive, he appeared\r\nwith a small duck! This he roasted to perfection, to be served cold, as\r\nthe hour for the dinner could not be determined in advance.\r\n\r\nWe were all expectation and excitement when a lady drove up rapidly and\r\nasked for shelter, as she had been \"driven in from the lines.\" Shelter I\r\ncould give by spreading quilts on the parlor floor—but, alas, my duck!\r\nMust my precious duck be sacrificed upon the altar of hospitality? I\r\nunlocked the little tin safe to assure myself that I could manage to\r\nkeep it hidden, and behold, it was gone! Not until next day, when it was\r\nplaced before my husband with a triumphant flourish (our unwelcome guest\r\nhad departed), did I discover that John had stolen it! \"Why, there's\r\nthe duck!\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Course here's the duck,\" said John, respectfully. \"Ducks got plenty of\r\nsense. They knows as well as folks when to hide.\"\r\n\r\nWe found our released prisoner pale and thin, but devoutly thankful\r\nto be at home. Mr. Connolly and the officers around us called in the\r\nevening, keenly anxious to hear his story, and heartily expressing\r\ntheir joy at his release. My friends in Washington had wished to send\r\nme some presents, but my husband declined them, accepting only two\r\ncans of pineapple. Mr. Connolly sent out for the \"boys in the yard\"\r\nand assisted me in dividing the fruit into portions, so each one should\r\nhave a bit. It was served on all the saucers and butter-plates we could\r\nfind, and Mr. Connolly himself handed the tray around, exclaiming, \"Oh,\r\nlads! It is just the _best_ thing you ever tasted!\" Then each soldier\r\nbrought forth his brier-root and gathered around the traveller for his\r\nstory. His story was a thrilling one—of his capture, his incarceration,\r\nhis comrades; finally, of the unexpected result of the efforts of his\r\nante-bellum friends, Washington McLean and John W. Forney, for his\r\nrelease. It was ascertained by these friends in Washington that he\r\nwas detained as hostage for the safety of some Union officer whom the\r\nConfederate government had threatened to put to death.\r\n\r\nMr. McLean and Colonel Forney first approached General Grant. The\r\nGeneral positively refused to grant their request. Then Mr. McLean\r\nvisited Mr. Stanton. He found Mr. Stanton in the library of his own\r\nhome, with his daughter in his arms, and the following conversation\r\nensued:—\r\n\r\n\"This is a charming fireside picture, Mr. Secretary! I warrant that\r\nlittle lady cares nothing for war or the Secretary of War! She has her\r\nfather, and that fills all her ambition.\"\r\n\r\n\"You never said a truer word, did he, pet?\" pressing the curly head\r\nclose to his bosom.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, Stanton, you will understand my errand. There are curly\r\nheads down there in old Virginia, weeping out their bright eyes for a\r\nfather loved just as this pretty baby loves you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes! Probably so,\" said Stanton.\r\n\r\n\"Now—there's Pryor—\"\r\n\r\nBut before another word could be said the Secretary of War pushed the\r\nchild from his knee and thundered:—\r\n\r\n\"He shall be hanged! Damn him!\"\r\n\r\nBut he had reckoned without his host when he supposed that Washington\r\nMcLean would not appeal from that verdict. Armed with a letter of\r\nintroduction from Horace Greeley, Mr. McLean visited Mr. Lincoln. The\r\nPresident remembered General Pryor's uniformly generous treatment of\r\nprisoners who had, at various times, fallen into his custody, especially\r\nhis capture at Manassas of the whole camp of Federal wounded, surgeons\r\nand ambulance corps, and his prompt parole of the same. Mr. Lincoln\r\nlistened attentively, and, after ascertaining all the facts, issued\r\nan order directing Colonel Burke, the commander at Fort Lafayette, to\r\n\"deliver Roger A. Pryor into the custody of Washington McLean.\"\r\n\r\nArmed with this order, Mr. McLean visited Fort Lafayette, where he found\r\nhis friend in close confinement in the casemate with other prisoners.\r\n\r\nAt that time John Y. Beall, a Confederate officer, was confined with\r\nGeneral Pryor, under sentence of death as a spy. Mr. McLean became\r\ninterested in his fate, and suggested that if General Pryor would make a\r\npersonal appeal in his behalf to President Lincoln, his execution might\r\nprobably be prevented. To that end, Mr. McLean telegraphed a request\r\nto Mr. Lincoln, that he accord General Pryor an interview, to which\r\na favorable response was promptly returned. The next evening, General\r\nPryor, with Mr. McLean and Mr. Forney, called at the White House, and\r\nwas graciously received by the President. General Pryor at once opened\r\nhis intercession in behalf of Captain Beall; but, although Mr. Lincoln\r\nevinced the sincerest compassion for the young man, and an extreme\r\naversion to his death, he felt constrained to yield to the assurance\r\nof General Dix, in a telegram just received, that the execution was\r\nindispensable to the security of the Northern cities—it being believed,\r\nthough erroneously, that Captain Beall was implicated in the burning\r\nof the New York hotels. Mr. Lincoln then turned the conversation to the\r\nrecent conference at Hampton Roads, the miscarriage of which he deplored\r\nwith the profoundest sorrow. He said that had the Confederate government\r\nagreed to the reëstablishment of the Union and the abolition of slavery,\r\nthe people of the South might have been compensated for the loss of\r\ntheir negroes and would have been protected by a universal amnesty,\r\nbut that Mr. Jefferson Davis made the recognition of the Confederacy a\r\ncondition _sine qua non_ of any negotiations. Thus, he declared, would\r\nMr. Davis be responsible for every drop of blood that should be shed\r\nin the further prosecution of the war, a futile and wicked effusion of\r\nblood, since it was then obvious to every sane man that the Southern\r\narmies must be speedily crushed. On this topic he dwelt so warmly and at\r\nsuch length that General Pryor inferred that he still hoped the people\r\nof the South would reverse Mr. Davis's action, and would renew the\r\nnegotiations for peace. Indeed, he declared in terms that he could not\r\nbelieve the senseless obstinacy of Mr. Davis represented the sentiment\r\nof the South. It was apparent to General Pryor that Mr. Lincoln desired\r\nhim to sound leading men of the South on the subject. Accordingly, on\r\nthe General's return to Richmond, he did consult with Senator Hunter and\r\nother prominent men in the Confederacy, but with one voice they assured\r\nhim that nothing could be done with Mr. Davis, and that the South had\r\nonly to wait the imminent and inevitable catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable catastrophe marched on apace.\r\n\r\nAgnes wrote from Richmond, March 28—the last letter I received from the\r\nConfederate capital:—\r\n\r\n     \"I do hate to write you bad news just now when you should be\r\n     so happy with our dear General, but, really and truly, I don't\r\n     at all like the looks of things here. Sheridan is at Ashland.\r\n     And General Sherman has finished up North Carolina, and is in\r\n     Virginia!\r\n\r\n     \"I made an excursion through some of the Main Street stores\r\n     last week—and recognized some of Mrs. Davis's things. I\r\n     learned that she had placed a great many articles at the\r\n     dry-goods stores for sale and had sold her horses. And now\r\n     comes the surprising news, that she has left the city with\r\n     her family. What does all this mean? Some of the girls here\r\n     have taken their jewellery to the Treasury Department, giving\r\n     it to help redeem the currency. I am sure they are welcome to\r\n     all mine!\"\r\n\r\nOn the morning of April 2 we were all up early that we might prepare\r\nand send to Dr. Claiborne's Hospital certain things we had suddenly\r\nacquired. An old farmer friend of my husband had loaded a wagon with\r\npeas, potatoes, dried fruit, hominy, and a little bacon, and had sent\r\nit as a welcoming present. We had been told of the prevalence of scurvy\r\nin the hospitals, and had boiled a quantity of hominy, and also of dried\r\nfruit, to be sent with the potatoes for the relief of the sick.\r\n\r\nMy husband said to me at our early breakfast:—\r\n\r\n\"How soundly you can sleep! The cannonading was awful last night. It\r\nshook the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that is only Fort Gregg,\" I answered. \"Those guns fire incessantly.\r\nI don't consider them. You've been shut up in a casemate so long you've\r\nforgotten the smell of powder.\"\r\n\r\nOur father, who happened to be with us that morning, said:—\r\n\r\n\"By the bye, Roger, I went to see General Lee, and told him you seemed\r\nto be under the impression that if your division moves, you should go\r\nalong with it. The General said emphatically: 'That would be violation\r\nof his parole, Doctor. Your son surely knows he cannot march with the\r\narmy until he is exchanged.'\"\r\n\r\nThis was a great relief to me, for I had been afraid of a different\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast I repaired to the kitchen to see the pails filled for\r\nthe hospital, and to send Alick and John on their errand.\r\n\r\nPresently a message was brought me that I must join my husband, who\r\nhad walked out to the fortification behind the garden. I found a low\r\nearthwork had been thrown up during the night still nearer our house,\r\nand on it he was standing.\r\n\r\nI have had, very lately, access to a Federal map of the intrenched lines\r\nin the immediate front of Petersburg, drawn by a major of engineers\r\nof the United States Army. There I find a double line of breastworks,\r\nprotected by thirty-four forts sweeping around the city and embracing\r\nsome six or eight miles of country beyond, on either side. Within the\r\nFederal line is a little thread of a line protected by lunettes and\r\nonly _two_ forts (for this map has quite a Chinese feeling), and these\r\ntwo are named by the enemy, Fort Gregg and Fort Baldwin—the latter our\r\nBattery 45. To my surprise I find the engineer had his eye on me all\r\nwinter. Near together are certain dots—two for \"Turnbull\" (General\r\nLee's headquarters), two for \"Green,\" two for \"Laighton,\" and four\r\nfor \"Pryor,\" representing the dwelling, office, kitchen, and servants'\r\nquarter at Cottage Farm! I perceive from the map that the engineer knew\r\nall about us all the time.\r\n\r\nTo return to the morning of April 2—my husband held out his hand and\r\ndrew me up on the breastwork beside him. Negroes were passing, wheeling\r\ntheir barrows, containing the spades they had just used. Below was a\r\nplain, and ambulances were collecting and stopping at intervals. Then a\r\nslender gray line stretched across under cover of the first earthwork\r\nand the forts. Fort Gregg and Battery 45 were belching away with all\r\ntheir might, answered by guns all along the line. While we gazed on\r\nall this the wood opposite seemed alive, and out stepped a division\r\nof bluecoats—muskets shining and banners flying in the morning sun. My\r\nhusband exclaimed: \"My God! What a line! They are going to fight here\r\nright away. Run home and get the children in the cellar.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the little encampment behind the house, I found the\r\ngreatest confusion. Tents were struck and a wagon was loading with them.\r\nCaptain Glover rode up to me and conjured me to leave immediately. I\r\nreminded him of his promise not to allow me to be surprised.\r\n\r\n\"We are ourselves surprised,\" he said; \"believe me, your life is\r\nnot safe here a moment.\" Tapping his breast, he continued, \"I bear\r\ndespatches proving what I say.\"\r\n\r\nI ran into the house and gathered my little children. I bade the\r\nservants remain. If things grew warm, they had the cellar, and perhaps\r\ntheir presence would save their own goods and mine, should the day go\r\nagainst us. Uncle Frank immediately repaired to the cellar. \"I have\r\nonly one order,\" I told the rest, \"hide the General's flag.\" As I left\r\n(bareheaded, I could not find my hat), I heard Uncle Frank call from the\r\nlittle portholes of his retreat to his wife, \"For Gawd's sake, Jinny,\r\nbring me a gode of water.\"\r\n\r\nThe morning was close and warm, and as we toiled up the dusty road\r\nI regretted the loss of my hat. Presently I met a gentleman driving\r\nrapidly from town. It was my neighbor, Mr. Laighton. He had removed his\r\nwife and little girls to a place of safety and was returning for me. He\r\nproposed, as we were now out of musket range, that I should rest with\r\nthe children under the shade of a tree, and he would return to the farm\r\nto see if he could save something—what did I suggest? I asked that he\r\nwould bring a change of clothing for the children and my medicine chest.\r\n\r\nAs we waited for his return some terrified horses dashed up the road,\r\none with blood flowing from his nostrils. When Mr. Laighton finally\r\nreturned, he brought news that he had seen my husband, that all the\r\ncooked provisions were spread out for the passing soldiers, and that\r\nmore were in preparation; also that he had promised to take care of me,\r\nand to leave the General free to dispense these things judiciously. John\r\nhad put the service of silver into the buggy, and Eliza had packed a\r\ntrunk, for which he was to return. This proved to be the French trunk\r\nin which Eliza sent a change of clothing.\r\n\r\nWe were all soon in the buggy and on our way to town.\r\n\r\n\"Where shall I take you?\" asked Mr. Laighton. I had no answer ready.\r\nI thought I would trust to chance for an invitation. But we found the\r\nstreets full of refugees like ourselves, and like ourselves, uncertain\r\nof shelter. Very few of our friends had remained in the city after the\r\nsiege had proven to be a permanent one.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, as we drove slowly through the crowded streets, we met\r\nMr. Stuart, my husband's tailor. He said a good house had been left\r\nvacant by one of his customers, who had authorized him to rent it.\r\n\r\n\"I now rent it to General Pryor,\" said Mr. Stuart, and he conducted\r\nus to the door of a residence near my old home on Washington Street.\r\nWhen the door-bell was answered he informed a man whom he addressed as\r\nRobert, that we had become his master's tenants, and said that Robert\r\nand his mother, now in the house, would not be required to leave,\r\nadding:—\r\n\r\n\"Take good care of this lady. I will see that your wages are paid and\r\nthat you are suitably rewarded.\"\r\n\r\nThe silver service was dumped down in the front porch, and there we\r\nawaited events. About noon John appeared. He had saved something!—my\r\nchampagne glasses! He had also brought a basket of biscuits. I sent him\r\nback to the farm, strictly ordering that the flag should be cared for.\r\nJohn told me it was safe. He had hidden it under some fence rails in the\r\ncellar. As to the battle, he had no news, except that \"Marse Roger is\r\ngiving away everything on the earth. All the presents from the farmer\r\nwill go in a little while.\"\r\n\r\nMy next envoy from the seat of war was Alick, who walked into the yard,\r\nleading Rose by a rope, and at once proceeded to stable her. Go back?\r\nNo, _marm_, not if he knew his name was Alick. His mammy had never\r\nborned him to be in no battle! And walking off to give Rose a pail of\r\nwater, he informed her that \"You'n me, Rose, is the only folks I see\r\nanywhar 'bout here with any sense.\"\r\n\r\nNeighbors soon discovered us; and to my joy I found that Mrs. Gibson,\r\nMrs. Meade, and Mr. Bishop—one of my father's elders—were in their own\r\nhouses, very near my temporary shelter.\r\n\r\nOur father, I learned afterwards, was with the hospital service of his\r\ncorps, and had been sent to the rear.\r\n\r\nThe hospitals under Dr. Claiborne were ordered off early in the day,\r\na significant indication of General Lee's accurate estimate of the\r\nprobabilities of the hour. Dr. Claiborne had three thousand sick and\r\nwounded men to move. Among them was Colonel Riddick, from Smithfield,\r\nthe brother of the spirited girl I had known there. She had come to\r\nPetersburg to nurse her wounded brother, and had left, in a wagon, with\r\nthe hospital train. Part of this train was captured, and the wagons\r\nwere ordered to be burned; but Miss Riddick positively refused to leave\r\nher seat, and as they could not burn the wagon with her in it, she was\r\nsuffered to proceed with her brother in her own equipage. Miss Riddick\r\nwas not a young lady who need fear. \"There's a divinity doth hedge\" some\r\nwomen. She was courteously treated and passed through the lines to her\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the evening the little boys came in with confidential news. The day\r\nhad gone against us; the city was to be surrendered after the retreat\r\nof the army at midnight. Their father would come in with the last.\r\n\r\nI remembered with anguish that I had lost my chance to save the\r\nimportant papers of the family. In a trunk in my room I had locked all\r\nmy one lover's beautiful letters, all the correspondence—so rich I had\r\nmeant to print it—of his residence in Greece, of his travels in the East\r\nand in Egypt; all the letters from statesmen and authors of the years\r\npreceding the struggle. There they were. They would be sport for the\r\nenemy in a few hours. My eldest son, Theodorick, and Campbell Pryor, my\r\nhusband's twelve-year-old brother, agreed to return to the farm, draw\r\nthe trunk out to the rear of the kitchen, break it open, set fire to\r\nthe contents, and not leave until they were consumed.\r\n\r\nIn due time the boys returned, having accomplished the burning of the\r\nletters, but bearing between them a huge bundle—a sheet full of papers.\r\n\"Father's sermons,\" explained Campbell.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for my tired little brood to go to bed, I found\r\nthree upper rooms prepared for us. In one of these I put the boys, first\r\nplacing the large silver tray between two mattresses. A hamper filled\r\nwith soiled towels and pinafores stood in a corner. Therein I bestowed\r\nthe six pieces of the service, covering the whole with the soiled linen.\r\nA smaller room I reserved for my husband, into which I locked him,\r\nputting the key in my pocket—for he had returned in such an excited\r\nframe of mind, and in such physical exhaustion, that I was uneasy about\r\nhim, lest he might, when the army passed, yield to his feelings and go\r\nalong with it.\r\n\r\nThen I took my seat at the window and listened. The firing had all\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nA ring at the door-bell startled me. There stood Mayor Townes, come to\r\nask if General Pryor would go out with the flag of truce and surrender\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he cannot—he cannot,\" I declared. \"How can you ask him to surrender\r\nhis old home? Besides, he is worn out, and is now sleeping heavily.\"\r\n\r\nAbout two o'clock, General Lee passed the house with his staff. It is\r\nsaid he looked back and said to his aide: \"This is just what I told them\r\nat Richmond. The line has been stretched until it snapped.\" Presently\r\nthere was a loud explosion—another—another. The bridges were being blown\r\nup. Then fires announced the burning of warehouses of tobacco.\r\n\r\nAnd then! As the dawn broke, I saw the Federal pickets entering\r\nsilently, watchfully. Finding no resistance, they threw their muskets\r\nover into the yard and hurried down town to plunder!\r\n\r\nI awoke my boys. \"Get up, boys! Dress quickly. Now remember, you must\r\nbe very self-controlled and quiet, and no harm will come to you.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately the door of my room was thrown wide open, and Robert ushered\r\nin three armed, German-looking soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"To search the house,\" they answered.\r\n\r\n\"You will find nothing worth your while. There is my shawl! I have just\r\nrun in from the lines. Here are my children.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't want your clothes,\" said one; \"we want your prisoner.\"\r\n\r\nMy husband had heard and knocked at his door. He had not undressed.\r\n\r\n\"Here I am,\" he said, coming out and fastening his collar; and, before\r\nI could think, they had marched him off.\r\n\r\nI was left alone with the boy Robert, who had betrayed him. He stood\r\ntrembling, not with fear—with excitement.\r\n\r\n\"Leave this house!\" I ordered him.\r\n\r\n\"What for?\" he asked sullenly.\r\n\r\n\"Because you are no friend of mine. This is now my house. You are not\r\nto set foot in it again.\"\r\n\r\nStrange to say, he left.\r\n\r\nHe had admitted into the house more soldiers than these three. I had\r\nbrought with me from the farm a little negress, Lizzie, who had been\r\nhired by Eliza \"to amuse the baby.\" Lizzie had obeyed the instinct which\r\nalways leads a child's Southern nurse to the kitchen, and had gone below\r\nwith my baby. I heard the most tremendous stamping and singing in the\r\nbasement kitchen, and from the top of the staircase I called to Lizzie,\r\nwho ran up, frightened, with the child in her arms. A soldier looked up\r\nfrom the bottom.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Getting breakfast,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"You'll get none here,\" I told him.\r\n\r\nHe set his bayonet forward and started up the steps. I slipped back and\r\nluckily found a bolt on the door. Quick as thought I bolted him out.\r\n\r\nBut I was burningly indignant. I saw the street full of troops standing,\r\nand a young officer on horseback. I ran out and said to him:—\r\n\r\n\"Is it your pleasure we should be murdered in our houses? My kitchen is\r\nfull of soldiers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where, where?\" exclaimed the young fellow, dismounting and running in.\r\n\r\nI conducted him to the bolted door, unfastened it, and had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing him lay about with the flat of his sword to\r\ngood purpose. He placed a guard around the house. Moreover, his action\r\nsustained me in my position, and the old woman in the kitchen greeted\r\nme respectfully, apologized for her son, and promised faithful service\r\nin the future.\r\n\r\nBut another and most bitter trial was in store for me. An approaching\r\narmy corps was hailed with shouts and cheers as it passed down\r\nthe street. At its head was borne the trophy that had aroused this\r\nenthusiasm: our own sacred banner, given by the women of Petersburg\r\nto the young colonel at Smithfield, and inscribed with the names of\r\nthe battles into which he had proudly borne it. It was coming back—a\r\ncaptive! How grateful I felt that my husband had not seen it! \"Ole Uncle\r\nFrank's at the bottom of that business,\" said Alick,—and alas! we had\r\nreason to suppose the polite old colored gentleman had purchased favor\r\nby revealing the hiding-place of our banner. My husband soon returned.\r\nHe had presented Mr. Lincoln's card, on which the President had written\r\nhis \"parole until exchanged.\" Thereafter he was arrested and released\r\nevery time the occupying troops moved and were replaced by new brigades\r\nand divisions.\r\n\r\nWe sat all day in the front room, watching the splendidly equipped host\r\nas it marched by on its way to capture Lee. It soon became known that\r\nwe were there. Within the next few days we had calls from old Washington\r\nfriends. Among others my husband was visited by Elihu B. Washburne, and\r\nSenator Henry Wilson, afterward Vice-President of the United States with\r\nGeneral Grant. These paid long visits and talked kindly and earnestly\r\nof the South.\r\n\r\nMajor-General Warren had been relieved of his command and superseded by\r\nSheridan. His old friend, Randolph Harrison, lay ill and wounded near\r\nus, and General Warren introduced himself to General Pryor and asked\r\nto be conducted to his friend's bedside. From that time he was with us\r\nevery day, and, indorsed warmly by \"Ranny,\" our old friend, he too was\r\nadmitted into our friendship.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln soon arrived and sent for my husband. But General Pryor\r\nexcused himself, saying that he was a paroled prisoner, that General\r\nLee was still in the field, and that he could hold no conference with\r\nthe head of the opposing army.\r\n\r\nThe splendid troops passed continually. Our hearts sank within us. We\r\nhad but one hope—that General Lee would join Joseph E. Johnston and find\r\nhis way to the mountains of Virginia, those ramparts of nature which\r\nmight afford protection until we could rest and recruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nRICHMOND SURRENDERS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      \"RICHMOND, April 5, 1865.\r\n\r\n     \"_My dear:_—I am not at all sure you will ever receive this\r\n     letter, but I shall risk it. _First_, I join you in humble\r\n     thanks to God for the great mercy accorded both of us. Your\r\n     General lives. My Colonel lives. What words can express our\r\n     gratitude? What is the loss of home and goods compared with\r\n     the loss of our own flesh and blood? Alas! Alas! for those\r\n     who have lost all!\r\n\r\n     \"I am sure you will have heard the grewsome story of\r\n     Richmond's evacuation. I was at St. Paul's Sunday, April 1,\r\n     when a note was handed to President Davis. He rose instantly,\r\n     and walked down the aisle—his face set, so we could read\r\n     nothing. Dr. Minnegerode gave notice that General Ewell\r\n     desired the forces to assemble at 3 P.M., and also that there\r\n     would be no further service that day. I had seen no one speak\r\n     to the doctor, and I wonder at the acuteness of his perception\r\n     of the state of affairs. As soon as I reached the hotel I\r\n     wrote a note to the proprietor, asking for news. He answered\r\n     that grave tidings had come from Petersburg, and for himself\r\n     he was by no means sure we could hold Richmond. He requested\r\n     me to keep quiet and not encourage a tendency to excitement\r\n     or panic. At first I thought I would read my services in the\r\n     quiet of my little sky parlor at the Spotswood, but I was\r\n     literally in a fever of anxiety. I descended to the parlor.\r\n     Nobody was there except two or three children with their\r\n     nurses. Later in the afternoon I walked out and met Mr. James\r\n     Lyons. He said there was no use in further evading the truth.\r\n     The lines were broken at Petersburg and that town and Richmond\r\n     would be surrendered late at night—he was going out himself\r\n     with the mayor and Judge Meredith with a flag of truce and\r\n     surrender the city. Trains were already fired to carry the\r\n     archives and bank officials. The President and his Cabinet\r\n     would probably leave at the same time.\r\n\r\n     \"'And you, Judge?'\r\n\r\n     \"'I shall stand my ground. I have a sick family, and we must\r\n     take our chances together.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Then seriously—really and truly—Richmond is to be given up,\r\n     after all, to the enemy.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Nothing less! And we are going to have a rough time, I\r\n     imagine.'\r\n\r\n     \"I could not be satisfied until I had seen Judge Campbell,\r\n     upon whom we so much relied for good, calm sense. I found him\r\n     with his hands full of papers, which he waved deprecatingly\r\n     as I entered.\r\n\r\n     \"'Just a minute, Judge! I am alone at the Spotswood and—'\r\n\r\n     \"'Stay there, my dear lady! You will be perfectly safe. I\r\n     advise all families to remain in their own houses. Keep quiet.\r\n     I am glad to know the Colonel is safe. He may be with you soon\r\n     now.'\r\n\r\n     \"With this advice I returned and mightily reassured and\r\n     comforted the proprietor of the Spotswood. He immediately\r\n     caused notice to be issued to his guests. I resolved to\r\n     convey my news to the families I knew best. The Pegrams were\r\n     in such deep affliction there was no room there for anxious\r\n     fears about such small matters as the evacuation of cities,\r\n     but I could see my dear Mrs. Paul, and Mrs. Maben, and say\r\n     a comforting word at the Allan home—closed to all the world\r\n     since poor John fell at Gettysburg. Mrs. Davis was gone and\r\n     out of harm's way. The Lees were sacred from intrusion. Four\r\n     members of that household—the General, 'Rooney,' Custis, and\r\n     Robert—were all at the post of danger. Late in the afternoon\r\n     three hundred or more prisoners were marched down the street;\r\n     the negroes began to stand about, quietly observant but\r\n     courteous, making no demonstration whatever. The day, you\r\n     remember, was one of those glorious days we have in April,\r\n     and millions on millions of stars watched at night, looking\r\n     down on the watchers below. I expected to sit by my window all\r\n     night as you always do in a troubled time, but sleep overtook\r\n     me. I had slept, but not undressed, when a loud explosion\r\n     shook the house—then another. There were crashing sounds of\r\n     falling glass from the concussion. I found the sun had risen.\r\n     All was commotion in the streets, and agitation in the hotel.\r\n     The city government had dragged hogsheads of liquor from the\r\n     shops, knocked in the heads, and poured the spirits into the\r\n     gutters. They ran with brandy, whiskey, and rum, and men,\r\n     women, and boys rushed out with buckets, pails, pitchers, and\r\n     in the lower streets, hats and boots, to be filled. Before\r\n     eight o'clock many public buildings were in flames, and a\r\n     great conflagration was evidently imminent. The flames swept\r\n     up Main Street, where the stores were quickly burned, and then\r\n     roared down the side streets almost to Franklin.\r\n\r\n     \"The doors of all the government bakeries were thrown open\r\n     and food was given to all who asked it. Women and children\r\n     walked in and helped themselves. At ten o'clock the enemy\r\n     arrived,—ten thousand negro troops, going on and on, cheered\r\n     by the negroes on the streets.\r\n\r\n     \"So the morning passed—a morning of horror, of terror! Drunken\r\n     men shouted and reeled through the streets, a black cloud from\r\n     the burning city hung like a pall over us, a black sea of\r\n     faces filled the street below, shells burst continuously in\r\n     the ashes of the burning armory. About four in the afternoon\r\n     a salute of thirty-four guns was fired. A company of mounted\r\n     dragoons advanced up the street, escorting an open carriage\r\n     drawn by four horses in which sat Mr. Lincoln and a naval\r\n     officer, followed by an escort of cavalry. They drove straight\r\n     to Mr. Davis's house, cheered all the way by negroes, and\r\n     returned the way they came. I had a good look at Mr. Lincoln.\r\n     He seemed tired and old—and I must say, with due respect to\r\n     the President of the United States, I thought him the ugliest\r\n     man I had ever seen. He was fairly elected the first time,\r\n     I acknowledge,—but was he the last? A good many of the 'free\r\n     and equal' were not allowed a vote then.\r\n\r\n     \"The next day I persuaded one of the lads in the hotel to\r\n     take a walk with me early in the morning, and I passed General\r\n     Lee's house. A Yankee guard was pacing to and fro before it—at\r\n     which I felt an impulse of indignation,—but presently the door\r\n     opened, the guard took his seat on the steps and proceeded\r\n     to investigate the contents of a very neatly furnished tray,\r\n     which Mrs. Lee in the kindness of her heart had sent out to\r\n     him.\r\n\r\n     \"I am obliged to acknowledge that there is really no hope now\r\n     of our ultimate success. Everybody says so. My heart is too\r\n     full for words. General Johnson says we may comfort ourselves\r\n     by the fact that war may decide a _policy_, but never a\r\n     _principle_. I imagine our _principle_ is all that remains to\r\n     us of hope or comfort.\r\n\r\n          \"Devotedly,\r\n               \"AGNES.\"\r\n\r\nFrom my friend Admiral Porter I learned that he landed with President\r\nLincoln, and that through some _contretemps_ no equipage was in waiting\r\nto conduct them through the streets of Richmond. They set out to walk,\r\nescorted by twelve of the boat's crew with bayonets fixed on their\r\nrifles. The day was warm, and the streets dusty, \"owing to the immense\r\ngathering of the crowd, kicking up the dirt.\" Mr. Lincoln took off his\r\nhat and fanned his face, from which the perspiration was pouring, and\r\nlooked as if he would give his presidency for a glass of water.\r\n\r\nThe admiral, _par parenthèse_, told many negro anecdotes in negro\r\ndialect, but, like all Northern imitators of that inimitable lingo,\r\nhe \"slipped up\" on many words. The negro does not say \"Massa\"—his word\r\nis \"Marster\"; he does not say \"_Bress_ de Lawd,\"—\"Thank Gawd A'mighty\"\r\nbeing his pious preference.\r\n\r\nThe triumphing party was overtaken by an equipage and a military\r\nescort, and proceeded, according to the admiral, \"to the mansion of Mr.\r\nDavis.[23] It was quite a small affair compared with the White House,\r\nand modest in all its appointments, showing that while President Davis\r\nwas engaged heart and soul in endeavoring to effect the division of the\r\nstates, he was not, at least, surrounding himself with regal style, but\r\nwas living in a modest, comfortable way, like any other citizen. Amid\r\nall his surroundings the refined taste of his wife was apparent, and\r\nmarked everything about the apartments.\" Admiral Porter thought that\r\nthe Confederate government had departed in an ignoble manner, \"that it\r\nshould have remained at the capital and surrendered in a dignified way,\r\nmaking terms for the citizens of the place, guarding their rights, and\r\nacknowledging they had lost the game. There was nothing to be ashamed\r\nof in such a surrender to a vastly superior force; their armies had\r\nfought as people never fought before. They had 'robbed the cradle and\r\nthe grave' to sustain themselves, and all that was wanted to make them\r\nglorious was the submission of their leaders and troops in a dignified\r\nway,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThis was also the feeling of many of our own best men—of General Lee\r\nand scores of his officers, of Judge Campbell, of the private citizens\r\nof Richmond. Mr. Davis differed from these men. General Lee's opinion\r\nwas known to his officers. General Gordon once said to him:—\r\n\r\n\"Have you expressed an opinion, as to the propriety of making terms, to\r\nthe President or to Congress?\"[24]\r\n\r\nHis reply was: \"General Gordon, I am a soldier. It is my duty to obey\r\norders.... It is enough to turn a man's hair gray to spend one day in\r\nthat Congress. The members are patriotic and earnest, but they will\r\nneither take the responsibility of acting nor will they clothe me with\r\nauthority to act. As for Mr. Davis, he is unwilling to do anything short\r\nof independence, and feels that it is useless to try to treat on that\r\nbasis.\" This conversation immediately preceded the terrible battle at\r\nPetersburg, and the consequent loss of that city and Richmond. Much\r\ncould have been saved in blood and in treasure had the final battles\r\nnever taken place. \"Whom the gods destroy they first infatuate.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIntelligence of the death of President Lincoln reached Petersburg on the\r\n17th of April. As he had been with us but a few days before, manifestly\r\nin perfect health and in all the glow and gladness of the triumph of the\r\nFederal arms, the community was unspeakably shocked by the catastrophe.\r\nThat he fell by the hand of an assassin, and that the deed was done by\r\na Confederate and avowedly in the interest of the Confederate cause,\r\nwere circumstances which distressed us with an apprehension that the\r\nentire South would be held responsible for the atrocious occurrence.\r\nThe day after the tragic news reached us the people of Petersburg in\r\npublic meeting adopted resolutions deploring the President's death\r\nand denouncing his assassination,—resolutions which gave expression to\r\nthe earnest and universal sentiment of Virginia. I question if, in any\r\nquarter of the country, the virtues of Abraham Lincoln—as exhibited in\r\nhis spirit of forgiveness and forbearance—are more revered than in the\r\nvery section which was the battle-ground of the fight for independence\r\nof his rule. It is certainly our conviction that had he lived the South\r\nwould never have suffered the shame and sorrow of the carpet-bag régime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nSHERIDAN'S OCCUPATION OF PETERSBURG\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch alarming rumors reached us from the neighboring counties, of\r\nmarauding parties plundering private houses and frightening defenceless\r\nwomen, that my husband obtained an extension of his parole, and\r\npermission to visit his sisters in Nottoway County. He had not heard\r\nfrom his father since the fight at Cottage Farm. Leaving me in the care\r\nof my neighbor, good Mr. Bishop, he set forth.\r\n\r\nThe first stirring event of our new position was the arrival of\r\nprisoners, marched through the streets under a strong guard. They\r\nwere a forlorn body of ragged, hatless, barefoot men. They had found\r\npoles or sticks somewhere, and upon them they waved their hats and\r\nhandkerchiefs—the poor, brave fellows! We women stood at the doors of\r\nour houses with smiles and encouraging words. One of the soldiers darted\r\nfrom the ranks, rushed to me, _embraced me_ as if I were a sister, and\r\nslipped his watch into my hands! It was a novel experience; but I think\r\nif he had appeared as a prisoner in the garb of Beelzebub, horns, hoofs,\r\nand all, I should not have flinched. Within the watch I found his name—a\r\nconnection of our family and a valued friend. He had recognized me, but\r\nI could not recognize the elegant young colonel in his impersonation of\r\na ragged barefoot boy.\r\n\r\nMy little sons soon found the destination of the captives, also that\r\ncitizens were getting permits from headquarters to take them home.\r\n\r\n\"Then you must go and ask General Hartsuff for a permit,\" I said. Upon\r\ninquiry it appeared that this could not be done by proxy. Some adult\r\nmember of the family must apply in person.\r\n\r\nSo I took my young escorts with me, and we went to \"Centre Hill,\" the\r\nfine Bolling House, where the General had made his headquarters. I\r\npresented my plea. How many did I want? I thought I could take care of\r\neight. Their names? I could give only one, the owner of the watch. The\r\nGeneral kindly conceded that I might select my men, adding, \"Would to\r\nGod I could release them all!\"\r\n\r\nThe first impression I had of the temporary prison was of stifling heat\r\nin which no one could live. The place smelt violently! My friend helped\r\nme choose my men, and I was required to present myself with them, armed\r\nwith my order, to have my name and theirs entered in an army register,\r\nwith an order that they report every day until the command moved on. As\r\nI was leaving the warehouse a fair-haired boy said to me, \"Oh, take me\r\nalong too!\"\r\n\r\n\"Take my arm,\" I said; and not until I reached the street did I realize\r\nthe enormity of my mistake. I had stolen a prisoner!\r\n\r\nI knew well I could be severely punished. My boy soon told me his name.\r\nHe was Frank Brooke, nephew of our dear Judge Randolph Tucker.\r\n\r\nBut here was a dilemma. All night I revolved it in my mind. I had nine\r\nmen—eight were to report next morning. Very early Alick knocked at my\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\"What is it now, Alick?\"\r\n\r\n\"One of dem prisoners run away las' night! I hear de do' open and jump\r\nup to see what's de matter. He say, 'Keep still, boy! Hit's all right!'\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is, Alick,\" I said, \"it's perfectly delightful.\"\r\n\r\nI took a piece of my husband's silver service down to the Northern\r\nsutler, and pawned it for two hundred dollars. With this money I\r\npurchased shoes, handkerchiefs, and hats for my men, and kept them\r\nin comfort for a week or more. They were then \"moved on\" to other and\r\ndistant quarters,—and all very soon liberated.\r\n\r\nOne morning early I was summoned from my room by Alick, who informed me\r\nthat four gentlemen had called. Descending to the parlor, I found four\r\nofficers in Federal uniform. As soon as I entered, one of them asked\r\nbrusquely:—\r\n\r\n\"How many rooms are in this house?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think there are eight or ten.\"\r\n\r\n\"General Sheridan wants the house for his adjutant's office.\"\r\n\r\nI was aware that General Sheridan had arrived the day before, and had\r\ntaken possession of Mr. Hamilton's elegant mansion on the next street,\r\nin the rear of my little dwelling.\r\n\r\nI at once perceived that the General, although in a house of twenty or\r\nmore rooms, had not desired the noise and inconvenience of an adjutant's\r\noffice under his own roof. I answered coldly:—\r\n\r\n\"I cannot oblige General Sheridan. My house is small. I need it for my\r\nown family.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the officers rose, crossed the room, and, standing before me,\r\nsaid sternly:—\r\n\r\n\"Madam, you seem to be unaware that when General Sheridan sees a house\r\nthat suits him, he knows how to make the terms for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, well,\" I replied, \"I had forgotten that fact for the moment. Do I\r\nunderstand my family must go in the street? How much time can you give\r\nme to remove them?\"\r\n\r\nThe officers withdrew into the hall and conferred together. Presently\r\none of them returned, and informed me courteously that they had\r\nconcluded not to annoy me. He was aware he was addressing Mrs. General\r\nPryor. His own name was Captain Lee, and he had been happy to spare me\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I was awakened soon after dawn by a tremendous hubbub\r\nbelow me, and sending my little maid, Lizzie, to ascertain the cause,\r\nshe beckoned to me to come to the head of the stairs. I threw on my\r\ngown, thrust my feet into my carpet slippers, and peeped over the\r\nbanister. Captain Lee was standing at the foot of the stair, writing a\r\nnote on the top of the newel post. Looking up, he saw me, and said: \"I\r\nwas writing to you, Madam. General Sheridan has ordered us to take your\r\nhouse. It is a military necessity. I pray you will try to be patient,\r\nand I will do all I can to save you annoyance.\"\r\n\r\n\"How soon must I leave?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all! We can allow you two rooms—the one you already occupy and\r\nthe one below it.\"\r\n\r\nI appreciated the concession of the latter room, and busied myself to\r\nmake of it dining room and sitting room.\r\n\r\nI brought beds from a rear room to my own chamber, for the lodging of my\r\nfamily. Alick was positively stricken at the new turn things had taken;\r\nbut I represented to him and to the boys the grave necessity, in their\r\nfather's absence, of discreet and always courteous behavior.\r\n\r\nTo add to my embarrassment, John brought in several hundred books he had\r\npicked up on the farm. They were dumped down in a pile in the corner of\r\nmy reception room.\r\n\r\nThe weather was intensely hot. It was impossible to sit with closed\r\ndoors. I locked the doors of my bedroom during the day, and all the\r\nfamily, except myself, lived in the yard under my eyes, unless the rain\r\ndrove them within.\r\n\r\nThe first night of our captivity I had sent my baby with her small nurse\r\nto bed. Hearing a heavy step overhead, I ran up to my room. Standing in\r\nan easy attitude, leaning on the mantel, was a large negro man. He was\r\nsmoking a cigar and talking to Lizzie.\r\n\r\n\"What is your business here?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Only my pleasure—to pass away a little time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look at me!\"\r\n\r\nThe negro raised his eyes with an insolent smile. Slowly and with\r\nemphasis I said:—\r\n\r\n\"Do you leave this room instantly! And mark well my words. If ever you\r\nenter it again, I shall KILL you!\"\r\n\r\nHe left, and alas, alas! my poor little Lizzie, whom I had hired from\r\nher mother, left also; and not by me or by her friends was she ever seen\r\nagain!\r\n\r\nOnly those who have lived in an adjutant's office can know the ceaseless\r\nnoise, turmoil, tramping to and fro, loud talking night and day.\r\nThere was _no_ night. The gas (which they left me to pay for) burned\r\nbrightly all night. Officers were coming in for orders day and night. I\r\nnever knew to what use the upper rooms were put; I only know they were\r\nrarely silent. All the business of a great army was transacted here,\r\nthat the General's entertaining, his elegant life, his sleep, might be\r\nundisturbed.\r\n\r\nThe sentry was drawn so closely around my doors that I could never\r\nenter the yard or garden without passing them. Finally, upon going out\r\nto the little vine-clad summer-house to give my baby air—I cannot say\r\nfresh air—one of the sentinels shook my equilibrium by informing me as\r\nI passed:—\r\n\r\n\"We've caught Jeff Davis.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I returned, my eyes cast down to avoid him, he stepped close to me\r\nand hissed in my ear, \"He shall be _hanged_.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Davis had not then been arrested, but this I did not know. Leaving\r\nmy baby with her brothers, I walked straight into the veranda of Mr.\r\nHamilton's house, asked for General Sheridan, was ushered into a room\r\nwhere a number of officers were sitting around a table, and announced\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n\"I am Mrs. Pryor, whose house you have taken for an adjutant's office.\r\nSentinels have been placed around my house who insult me when I cross\r\nthe threshold.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Sheridan rose: \"What can we do for you, Madam? What do you\r\ndemand?\"\r\n\r\n\"That the sentry around my house be removed to the street enclosure.\"\r\n\r\nI was invited to take a seat, but I preferred standing while an order\r\nwas made out. I have often smiled to think what I must have looked like\r\nto those officers. My gown was of chocolate-colored percale, with a\r\nwhite spot. Enormous hoops were then in fashion. I had long since been\r\nabandoned by mine. I fancy I resembled nothing so much as the wooden\r\nMrs. Noah who presides over the animals in the children's \"Noah's Arks.\"\r\nI took the order given me, bowed my thanks, and walked through a line of\r\nsoldiers home. After this I had the larger liberty my children needed.\r\n\r\nIt was my custom, in these days of my captivity, to descend early, that\r\nI might guard my books, to my little reception room. A dining room it\r\ndid not become for a long time afterward. I had nothing whatever to eat\r\nexcept the biscuits brought me by Mr. Bishop, and a daily tray sent at\r\nnoon by my angel friend, Mrs. Meade. She had some Northern men boarding\r\nwith her and could command such fare as the sutler was willing to sell,\r\nfor the farmers were as destitute of fresh food as ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe had been excellent customers of a cigar shop in old times, and the\r\nproprietor now opened his establishment, and intrusted my boys and\r\nCampbell with a \"walking agency.\" They sold cigars at good profit to\r\nthe officers and soldiers around us; and we made acquaintance once more\r\nwith United States pennies and dimes.\r\n\r\nSitting all day in my little reception room, I was cheered by visits\r\nfrom my friends, and occasionally the tenants of the house would ask for\r\na glass of water from the sideboard. Captain Lee came often. He confided\r\nto me his chagrin at the manners of the Petersburg ladies. He had picked\r\nup a veil for a pretty girl, and she had turned away her head when her\r\nhand was extended to receive it. The Captain was deeply hurt: he was \"a\r\nNorthern man, yes, but\" he was \"a gentleman.\"\r\n\r\nOne day Captain Lee informed me that he had good news for me. \"We have\r\nmarching orders! We go to-night! I know you are pleased! We have given\r\nyou so much trouble!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not more, I suppose, than was necessary!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I must say, you have been very patient. General Sheridan is in\r\nthe office and wishes to make his respects to you.\"\r\n\r\nThe General entered and thanked me for the manner in which I had endured\r\nall the inconvenience to which he had subjected me. He seemed, for some\r\nreason, to wish me to think well of his course toward us, and began to\r\nexplain it. He alluded to the policy that he had adopted.\r\n\r\n\"It was the very best thing to do,\" he declared. \"The only way to stamp\r\nout this rebellion was to handle it without gloves.\"\r\n\r\nIf he fancied I would either argue or agree with him, he mistook me. I\r\nwas silent. There was an embarrassing pause, and he began to berate our\r\ngovernment for bad management. \"Ladies should be better cared for,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I assure you there was no necessity for your starving! I have\r\nunearthed, within forty miles of this place, enough provisions to keep\r\nyou in perfect comfort.\"\r\n\r\nLooking down, he espied the brown eyes of my baby steadfastly fastened\r\non his face.\r\n\r\n\"I think I must borrow this little lady,\" he said. \"It is not often\r\nGeneral Sheridan has anything in his arms as sweet as this.\"\r\n\r\nHe still had her in his arms as he turned to leave the room, and she\r\ngladly went with him. Presently she was brought back with a parcel in\r\nher own arms—figs, bananas, cakes, and nuts.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lee came in late to bid me good-by, and to reiterate his thanks.\r\n\r\n\"You really have been so very nice! Now I am going to beg you will allow\r\nme to make some return.\"\r\n\r\nI hastened to accept his offer. I told him that my General's pet mare,\r\nLady Jane, was in his command. She had been missing ever since the\r\nbattles around Richmond. John was sure he had seen her. By some chance\r\nshe had fallen into the hands of the troops now in Petersburg. Could it\r\nbe possible for me to reclaim her?\r\n\r\nThe Captain looked grieved.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said; \"I had no thought of anything of that kind. But a great\r\nmany ladies have asked for what I am going to give you. I have brought\r\nyou General Sheridan's autograph.\"\r\n\r\nHe instantly interpreted my disappointment. Before I could recover he\r\nadded, \"But it appears you don't wish it,\" and threw it on the table.\r\n\r\n\"I can at least, Captain, be grateful that you tried to please me.\"\r\n\r\nThat night the adjutant's office was closed. Next morning my husband\r\nreturned. General Warren came in to see him. General Sheridan stood\r\non our porch to receive the homage of his men, bowing to their cheers.\r\nGeneral Warren looked on from our window. Presently the troops he had\r\ncommanded when he was superseded by Sheridan passed the house. They saw\r\ntheir old commander, and the shouts, \"Hurrah for General Warren,\" must\r\nhave been harsh sounds for General Sheridan.\r\n\r\nI was alone one afternoon in my accustomed seat, when a tall,\r\nlantern-jawed soldier with a musket on his shoulder marched in.\r\n\r\n\"I want some whiskey!\" he informed me.\r\n\r\n\"You'll not get it here!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wall, I guess you'll have to scare it up. I'll search the house.'\r\n\r\n\"Search away! I'll call the provost guard to help you,\" I said.\r\n\r\nHe turned and marched out. At the door he sent me a parting shot:—\r\n\r\n\"Wall! you've got a damned tongue ef you ain't got no whiskey!\"\r\n\r\nMy husband has always considered this a very good story. I forestall\r\nhim by telling it myself!\r\n\r\nI grew very fond of General Warren. He spent many hours with us;\r\ntactful, considerate, and kind, he never grieved or offended us.\r\n\r\nOne evening he silently took his seat. Presently he said:—\r\n\r\n\"I have news which will be painful to you. It hurts me to tell you, but\r\nI think you had rather hear it from me than from a stranger—General Lee\r\nhas surrendered.\"\r\n\r\nIt was an awful blow to us. All was over. All the suffering, bloodshed,\r\ndeath—all for nothing!\r\n\r\nGeneral Johnston's army was surrendered to General Sherman in North\r\nCarolina on April 26. The banner which had led the armies of the South\r\nthrough fire and blood to victory, to defeat, in times of starvation,\r\ncold, and friendlessness; the banner that Helen's lover had waved aloft\r\non a forlorn hope until it fell from his lifeless hands; the banner\r\nfound under the dying boy at Gettysburg, who had smilingly refused\r\nassistance lest it be discovered,—the banner of a thousand histories\r\nwas furled forever, with none so poor to do it reverence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nWOE TO THE VANQUISHED!\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately after General Lee's surrender, the United States Circuit\r\nCourt held a session at Norfolk, Virginia, and made haste to indict for\r\ntreason Robert E. Lee, John C. Breckenridge, Roger A. Pryor, and others.\r\nThese men thereafter were not to feel any sense of personal security.\r\nA cloud of doubt and possible disaster still hung over them. Under this\r\ncloud they were to commence their lives anew.\r\n\r\nEvery one who has suffered an overwhelming misfortune must be conscious\r\nof a strange deadening of feeling—more intolerable even than pain. It\r\nmay be a merciful provision of nature. Insensibility at a crucial moment\r\nmay be nature's anæsthesia. Dr. Livingstone, the African explorer,\r\nrelates that he was conscious of this insensibility when in the paws\r\nof a lion. He had a theory that the instinct of all animals to shake\r\ntheir victim, as the cat does a mouse, may be given in mercy to the\r\nvanquished. I was so completely stunned by the thought that all the\r\nsuffering, all the spilt blood, all the poverty, all the desolation\r\nof the South was _for naught_; that her very fidelity, heroism, and\r\nfortitude, qualities so noble in themselves, had wrought her undoing,\r\nthat I seemed to become dead to everything around me. My husband was\r\ncompelled to leave me, to seek employment in Richmond. My neighbors,\r\nlike myself, were stunned into silence. \"Here I and sorrow sit\" might\r\nhave been said truly of any one of us.\r\n\r\nWhen the passing troops left us with only General Hartsuff's guard, the\r\nsmall earnings of my little boys ceased. John and his fellow-servants\r\ncame into town, and reported to me.\r\n\r\n\"I can no longer maintain you or give you wages,\" I said to Eliza Page\r\nand her sisters.\r\n\r\n\"We will serve you for the good you have already done us,\" they said,\r\nbut of course I could not allow this to any extent. Eliza returned to\r\nher husband and their little home.\r\n\r\nWith John I had more trouble. It was hard to make him understand that\r\nI could not afford his services on any terms.\r\n\r\n\"I will never leave you,\" was his reply to everything I urged.\r\n\r\n\"You _must_, John! You must go home to your father in Norfolk. He will\r\nadvise you.\"\r\n\r\n\"The old man is in the oyster business,\" said John. \"What do I care\r\nabout oysters? All I care for is Marse Roger and these boys.\"\r\n\r\nI knew that my poor John had an infirmity. Once when I had sent him with\r\nAlick from Cottage Farm on an errand he had returned very late. I could\r\nsee the pair walking down the road alone, followed at some distance by\r\nthe horse and wagon. They seemed to be trying to compass both sides\r\nof the road at once. Alick was the first to report to me, with these\r\nwords:—\r\n\r\n\"I—I-ain' drunk,—but _Jawn_! Jawn, he _ve'y_ drunk!\"\r\n\r\nThis painful scene had been reënacted often enough to make me anxious.\r\n\r\n\"You really must go to your father, John,\" I insisted. \"How much money\r\nhave you?\" He had five dollars. I also had five, which I gave him.\r\n\r\n\"Now don't let me see you again,\" I said. \"Write to me from Norfolk.\"\r\n\r\nHe left, protesting, but next morning he was gone. I heard from him soon\r\nand from his father. The old gentleman expressed gratitude and also some\r\nanxiety about John's \"army habits.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so no more of the only slave I ever owned!\r\n\r\nAgnes wrote from Richmond early in May:—\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAREST: What could I do without you? Now don't flatter\r\n     yourself that I need now, or ever did need, those beautiful\r\n     moral reflections in well-chosen language by means of which\r\n     you have striven to educate me. But you are an unmitigated\r\n     blessing when my 'feelings are too many for me'—when, in\r\n     short, I boil over.\r\n\r\n     \"Now when a kettle boils over it puts out the fire, and then\r\n     we go tea-less to bed. How nice it would be for the kettle if\r\n     some convenient utensil were at hand to receive its excited\r\n     bubbles.\r\n\r\n     \"I am aggrieved and indignant at the sermons people are\r\n     preaching to us. And I have caught a young brother in a\r\n     flagrant theft. All Richmond is in a state of beautiful\r\n     admiration at a sermon it listened to last week on the uses\r\n     of our great misfortune. War was declared to be a blessing.\r\n     'The high passion of patriotism prevents the access of baser\r\n     passions. Men's hearts beat together, and woman is roused from\r\n     the frivolousness and feebleness into which her nature is apt\r\n     to sink. Death, insult, carnage, violated homes, and broken\r\n     hearts are all awful. But it is worse than a thousand deaths\r\n     when a people has adopted the creed that the wealth of nations\r\n     consists—not in generous hearts, in primitive simplicity, in\r\n     preference of duty to life; not in MEN, but in silk, cotton,\r\n     and something that they call \"capital.\" If the price to be\r\n     paid for peace is this—that wealth accumulates and men decay,\r\n     better far that every street in every town of our once noble\r\n     country should run blood.'\r\n\r\n     \"Now all this is very fine, but very one-sided. And my brother\r\n     didn't believe a word of it. He has been away in England and\r\n     has seen none of the horrors of war; but he has seen something\r\n     else—a very charming lecture printed in London some time\r\n     before the war.[25]\r\n\r\n     \"Strange are the ways of Providence. Precisely that I might\r\n     convict him did this address fall into my hands in Washington.\r\n     It struck me forcibly at the time. Little did I think I should\r\n     hear it in Richmond after a terrible civil war of our own.\r\n\r\n     \"I feel impatient at this attempt to extort good for ourselves\r\n     out of the overwhelming disaster which brought such ruin\r\n     to others; to congratulate ourselves for what is purchased\r\n     with their blood. Surely, if for no other reason, for the\r\n     sake of the blood that has been spilt, we should not hasten\r\n     to acquiesce in the present state of things. If I catch my\r\n     Colonel piously affirming too much resignation, too prompt\r\n     a forgetfulness of the past, I'll—well, he knows what I am\r\n     capable of saying!\r\n\r\n     \"But, now that I have safely boiled over, I will tell you my\r\n     news. We cannot remain here. We are literally stripped to the\r\n     'primitive' state my reverend brother thinks so good for us.\r\n     We are wofully in need of 'silk, cotton, and something they\r\n     call capital,' and we'll never get it here. And so my Colonel\r\n     and I are going to New York. He has secured a place in some\r\n     publishing house or other. I only wish it were a dry-goods\r\n     store!\r\n\r\n     \"Of course our social life is all over. I have taken my\r\n     resolution. There are fine ladies in New York whom I used to\r\n     entertain in Washington. Just so far as they approach me, will\r\n     I approach them! A card for a card, a visit for a visit. But I\r\n     imagine I shall not be recognized. I am content. There will be\r\n     plenty to read in that publishing house. I shall not repine.\r\n     All the setting, the _entourage_, of a lady is taken from me,\r\n     but the lady herself has herself pretty well in hand, and is\r\n     quite content if she may always be\r\n\r\n          \"Your devoted\r\n               \"AGNES.\"\r\n\r\nThe time now came when I must draw rations for my family. I could not\r\ndo this by proxy. I was required to present my request in person.\r\n\r\nAs I walked through the streets in early morning, I thought I had never\r\nknown a lovelier day. How could Nature spread her canopy of blossoming\r\nmagnolia and locust as if nothing had happened? How could the vine over\r\nthe doorway of my old home load itself with snowy roses, how could the\r\nbirds sing, how could the sun shine as if such things as these could\r\never again gladden our broken hearts?\r\n\r\nMy dear little sons understood they were to escort me everywhere, so we\r\npresented ourselves together at the desk of the government official and\r\nannounced our errand.\r\n\r\n\"Have you taken the oath of allegiance, Madam?\" inquired that gentleman.\r\n\r\n\"No, Sir.\" I was quite prepared to take the oath.\r\n\r\nThe young officer looked at me seriously for a moment, and said, as he\r\nwrote out the order:—\r\n\r\n\"Neither will I require it of you, Madam!\"\r\n\r\nI was in better spirits after this pleasant incident, and, calling to\r\nAlick, I bade him arm himself with the largest basket he could find and\r\ntake my order to the commissary.\r\n\r\n\"We are going to have all sorts of good things,\" I told him, \"fresh\r\nmeat, fruit, vegetables, and everything.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the boy returned he presented a drooping figure and a woebegone\r\nface. My first unworthy suspicion suggested his possible confiscation\r\nof my stores for drink, but he soon explained.\r\n\r\n\"I buried that ole stinkin' fish! I wouldn't bring it in your presence.\r\nAn' here's the meal they give me.\"\r\n\r\nHairy caterpillars were jumping through the meal! I turned to my table\r\nand wrote:—\r\n\r\n     \"Is the commanding general aware of the nature of the ration\r\n     issued this day to the destitute women of Petersburg?\"\r\n     (signing myself)\r\n\r\n          \"MRS. ROGER A. PRYOR.\"\r\n\r\nThis I gave to Alick, with instructions to present it, with the meal,\r\nto General Hartsuff.\r\n\r\nAlick returned with no answer; but in a few minutes a tall orderly stood\r\nbefore me, touched his cap, and handed me a note.\r\n\r\n     \"Major-General Hartsuff is sorry he cannot make _right_ all\r\n     that seems so wrong. He sends the enclosed. Some day General\r\n     Pryor will repay\r\n\r\n          \"GEORGE L. HARTSUFF,\r\n          \"_Major-General Commanding_.\"\r\n\r\nThe note contained an official slip of paper:—\r\n\r\n     \"The Quartermaster and Commissary of the Army of the Potomac\r\n     are hereby ordered to furnish Mrs. Roger A. Pryor with all\r\n     she may demand or require, charging the same to the private\r\n     account of\r\n\r\n          \"GEORGE L. HARTSUFF,\r\n          \"_Major-General Commanding_.\"\r\n\r\nWithout the briefest deliberation I wrote and returned the following\r\nreply:—\r\n\r\n     \"Mrs. Roger A. Pryor is not insensible to the generous offer\r\n     of Major-General Hartsuff, but _he ought to have known_ that\r\n     the ration allowed the destitute women of Petersburg must be\r\n     enough for\r\n\r\n          \"MRS. ROGER A. PRYOR.\"\r\n\r\nAs I sat alone, revolving various schemes for our sustenance,—the\r\nselling of the precious testimonial service (given by the Democracy of\r\nVirginia after my husband's noble fight against \"Know-nothingism\"),\r\nthe possibility of finding occupation for myself,—the jingling of\r\nchain harness at the door arrested my attention. There stood a handsome\r\nequipage, from which a very fine lady indeed was alighting. She bustled\r\nin with her lace-edged handkerchief to her eyes, and announced herself\r\nas Mrs. Hartsuff. She was superbly gowned in violet silk and lace, with\r\na tiny _fanchon_ bonnet tied beneath an enormous cushion of hair behind,\r\nthe first of the fashionable _chignons_ I had seen—an arrangement called\r\na \"waterfall,\" an exaggeration of the plethoric, distended \"bun\" of the\r\nEnglishwoman of a few years ago.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my dear lady,\" she began, \"we are in such distress at headquarters!\r\nGeorge is in despair! You won't let him help you! Whatever is he to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I really am grateful to the General,\" I assured her; \"but you see there\r\nis no reason he should do more for me than for others.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but there _is_ reason. You have suffered more than the rest. You\r\nhave been driven from your home! Your house has been sacked. George\r\nknows all about you. I have brought a basket for you—tea, coffee, sugar,\r\ncrackers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot accept it, I am so sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what are you going to do? Are you going to starve?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely,\" I said, \"but somehow I shall not very much mind!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, this is too utterly, utterly dreadful!\" said the lady as she left\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nThe next day the ration was changed. Fresh beef, canned vegetables,\r\nbread, and coffee were issued to all the women of Petersburg. Mrs.\r\nHartsuff came daily to see me. \"Not that George has gotten over it!\"\r\nshe declared. \"His feelings are constantly hurt here. And as to myself,\r\nthat old black Irene I found in the kitchen at Centre Hill just walks\r\nover me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you dismiss her?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Dismiss Irene?_ I should like to see anybody dismiss Irene! Besides,\r\nshe cooks divinely. But I can't enter her kitchen! 'Dear me,' I said one\r\nday, '_what_ a dirty kitchen!' 'Ladies don't nuvver come in kitchens,'\r\nshe told me. Evidently I am not a lady! And I once asked her please to\r\nbe careful of the gold studs the General was apt to leave in his cuffs\r\n'Gold studs!' she repeated with a sniff, 'my master wore diamond studs,\r\nan' I never see cuffs loose from shirts before in all my born days.\r\n'Cose the wind'll blow 'em away! I can't be 'sponsible for no shirt\r\nthat's in three or four pieces.'\"\r\n\r\nAll the good citizens of Petersburg who had been driven away by the\r\nshelling now began to return, and among them came the owners of the\r\nhouse I was occupying. I was told that I could, on no account, be safe\r\nat Cottage Farm without a guard. For this, too, I must make personal\r\nrequest. So my little body-guard and I wended our way to interview\r\nGeneral Hartsuff.\r\n\r\nWe found him in the noble mansion of the Bollings. At the entrance two\r\nfine greyhounds in marble had for many years guarded the incoming and\r\noutgoing of the Bolling family. In the rear there was a long veranda\r\nwith lofty pillars, and beyond, extensive grounds set with well-grown\r\nevergreens, and with that princely tree, the _magnolia grandiflora_, now\r\nin bloom. White marble statues and marble seats were scattered through\r\nthe grounds. A rustic staircase led down to a conservatory, built low\r\nfor the better care of the plants. The mansion stood on an eminence\r\nsloping sharply in front, and a legend-haunted subterranean passage led\r\nfrom the dwelling to the street, the entrance to which was covered by\r\nshrubs and vines.\r\n\r\nAs I stood in the veranda waiting for audience, a young officer called\r\nmy attention to the beauty of the grounds and the magnificence of the\r\nflowering plants in tubs on the veranda. \"I should like,\" he said, \"to\r\nfight it out on this line all summer.\"\r\n\r\nI thought of the family driven from their own, and was wicked enough to\r\ntell him:—\r\n\r\n\"That would be most unfortunate for you. This place is very sickly in\r\nsummer—deadly, in fact. Typhoid fever is fatal in this section.\"\r\n\r\nBut I was summoned to the presence of the great man. As I entered, he\r\ncontinued writing at a table, without greeting me or looking up from\r\nhis paper.\r\n\r\n\"General,\" I commenced, \"I have come to ask if I may have a guard. I am\r\nabout to return to my home—Cottage Farm.\"\r\n\r\nNo answer, except the rapid scratching of his pen as it travelled over\r\nhis sheet.\r\n\r\n\"General Hartsuff, are you still angry with me because I did not feel\r\nI could accept your kind offer? I couldn't take it! I couldn't trust\r\nmyself with it! I should have given a ball and ruined you.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed outright at this and threw down his pen.\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible for you to go to Cottage Farm,\" he said; \"there are\r\nfifty or more negroes on the place. You cannot live there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must! it is my only shelter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, I'll allow you a guard, and Mrs. Hartsuff had better take\r\nyou out herself, that is, if you can condescend to accept as much.\"\r\n\r\nI was not aware that Mrs. Hartsuff had entered and stood behind me.\r\n\r\n\"And I think, George,\" she said, \"you ought to give Mrs. Pryor a horse\r\nand cart in place of her own that were stolen.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, all right,\" he said hastily. \"Madam, you will find the\r\nguard at your door when you arrive. You go this evening? All right—good\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hartsuff duly appeared in the late afternoon with an ambulance\r\nand four horses, and we departed in fine style. She was very cheery and\r\nagreeable, and made me promise to let her come often to see me. As we\r\nwere galloping along in state, we passed a line of weary-looking, dusty\r\nConfederate soldiers, limping along, on their way to their homes. They\r\nstood aside to let us pass. I was cut to the heart at the spectacle.\r\nHere was I, accepting the handsome equipage of the invading commander—I,\r\nwho had done nothing, going on to my comfortable home; while they,\r\npoor fellows, who had borne long years of battle and starvation, were\r\nmournfully returning on foot, to find, perhaps, no home to shelter them.\r\n\"Never again,\" I said to myself, \"shall this happen! If I cannot help,\r\nI can at least suffer with them.\"\r\n\r\nBut when I reached Cottage Farm I found a home that no soldier, however\r\nforlorn, could have envied me. A scene of desolation met my eyes. The\r\nearth was ploughed and trampled, the grass and flowers were gone, the\r\ncarcasses of six dead cows lay in the yard, and filth unspeakable had\r\ngathered in the corners of the house. The evening air was heavy with the\r\nsickening odor of decaying flesh. As the front door opened, millions of\r\nflies swarmed forth.\r\n\r\n\"If this were I,\" said Mrs. Hartsuff, as she gathered her skirts as\r\nclosely around her as her hoops would permit, \"I should fall across this\r\nthreshold and die.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not fall,\" I said proudly; \"I shall stand in my lot.\"\r\n\r\nWithin was dirt and desolation. Pieces of fat pork lay on the floors,\r\nmolasses trickled from the library shelves, where bottles lay uncorked.\r\nFilthy, malodorous tin cans were scattered on the floors. Nothing,\r\nnot even a tin dipper to drink out of the well, was left in the house,\r\nexcept one chair out of which the bottom had been cut, and one bedstead\r\nfastened together with bayonets. Picture frames were piled against the\r\nwall. I eagerly examined them. Every one was empty. One family portrait\r\nof an old lady was hanging on the wall with a sabre-cut across her face.\r\n\r\n\"Now, what in the world are you going to do?\" asked Mrs. Hartsuff.\r\n\r\n\"The best I can,\" I said.\r\n\r\nBut old Aunt Jinny had espied me, and, with a courtesy to Mrs. Hartsuff,\r\nhad seized my little girl.\r\n\r\n\"This is a hard home-coming for you, my po' lamb! But never mind! Jinny\r\nhas got plenty of clean bedclothes and things. Yes, marm\" (to Mrs.\r\nHartsuff), \"I can take care of 'em! The colored people? Oh, the colored\r\npeople will give no trouble. They are very peaceable.\"\r\n\r\nShe gathered us into her kitchen while she swept a room for us and\r\nspread quilts upon the floor. Later in the evening an ambulance from\r\nMrs. Hartsuff drove up. She had sent me a tin box of bread-and-butter\r\nsandwiches, some tea, an army cot, and army bedding.\r\n\r\nThe guard, a great, tall fellow, came to me for orders. I felt nervous\r\nat his presence and wished I had not brought him. I directed him to\r\nwatch all night at the road side of the house, while I would sit up and\r\nkeep watch in the opposite direction. The children soon slept upon the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nAs the night wore on, I grew extremely anxious about the strange\r\nnegroes. Aunt Jinny thought there were not more than fifty. They had\r\nfilled every outhouse except the kitchen. Suppose they should overpower\r\nthe guard and murder us all.\r\n\r\nEverything was quiet. I had not the least disposition to sleep—thinking,\r\nthinking, of all the old woman had told me of the sacking of the house,\r\nof the digging of the cellar in search of treasure, of the torch that\r\nhad twice been applied to the house, and twice withdrawn because some\r\nofficer wanted the shaded dwelling for a temporary lodging. Presently I\r\nwas startled by a shrill scream from the kitchen, a door opened suddenly\r\nand shut, and a voice cried, \"Thank Gawd! Thank Gawd A'mighty.\" Then\r\nall was still.\r\n\r\nWas this a signal? I held my breath and listened, then softly rose,\r\nclosed the shutters and fastened them, crept to the door, and bolted it\r\ninside. I might defend my children till the guard could come.\r\n\r\nEvidently he had not heard! He was probably sleeping the sleep of\r\nan untroubled conscience on the bench in the front porch. And with\r\nuntroubled consciences my children were sleeping. It was so dark in\r\nthe room I could not see their faces, but I could touch them, and push\r\nthe wet locks from their brows, as they lay in the close and heated\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nI resumed my watch at the window, pressing my face close to the slats of\r\nthe shutters. A pale half-moon hung low in the sky, turning its averted\r\nface from a suffering world. At a little distance I could see the\r\nfreshly made soldier's grave which Alick had discovered and reported.\r\nA heavy rain had fallen in the first hours of the night, and a stiff\r\narm and hand now protruded from the shallow grave. To-morrow I would\r\nreverently cover the appealing arm, be it clad in blue or in gray, and\r\nwould mark the spot. Now, as I sat with my fascinated gaze upon it,\r\nI thought of the tens of thousands, of the hundreds of thousands, of\r\nupturned faces beneath the green sod of old Virginia. Strong in early\r\nmanhood, brave, high-spirited men of genius, men whom their country had\r\neducated for her own defence in time of peril,—they had died because\r\nthat country could devise in her wisdom no better means of settling a\r\nfamily quarrel than the wholesale slaughter of her sons by the sword.\r\nAnd now? \"Not till the heavens be no more shall they awake nor be raised\r\nout of their sleep.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, as I sorrowed for their early death in loneliness and anguish,\r\nI remembered the white-robed souls beneath the altar of God,—the souls\r\nthat had \"come out of great tribulation,\"—and _because_ they had thus\r\nsuffered \"they shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; ... and\r\nGod shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, as the pale, distressful moon sank behind the trees, and the\r\nred dawn streamed up from the east, the angel of Hope, who had \"spread\r\nher white wings and sped her away\" for a little season, returned. And\r\nHope held by the hand an angel stronger than she, who bore to me a\r\nmessage: \"In the world ye have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have\r\novercome the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun was rising when I saw my good old friend emerge from her\r\nkitchen, and I opened the shutters to greet her. She had brought me\r\na cup of delicious coffee, and was much distressed because I had not\r\nslept. Had I heard anything?\r\n\r\n\"Course I know you was bleeged to hear,\" said Aunt Jinny, as she bustled\r\nover the children. \"That was Sis' Winny! She got happy in the middle\r\nof the night, an' Gawd knows what she would have done, if Frank hadn't\r\nketched hold of her and pulled her back in the kitchen! Frank an' me is\r\npretty nigh outdone an' discouraged 'bout Sis' Winny. She prays constant\r\nall day; but Gawd A'mighty don't count on bein' bothered all night. Ain'\r\nHe 'ranged for us all to sleep, an' let Him have a little peace? Sis'\r\nWinny must keep her happiness to herself, when folks is trying to git\r\nsome res'.\"\r\n\r\nThe guard now came to my window to say he \"guessed\" he'd \"have to put\r\non some more harness. Them blamed niggers refused to leave. They might\r\nchange their minds when they saw the pistols.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you wouldn't shoot, would you?\" I said, in great distress. \"Call\r\nthem all to the back door and let me speak with them.\" I found myself\r\nin the presence of some seventy-five negroes, men, women, and children,\r\nall with upturned faces, keenly interested in what I should say to them.\r\n\r\nI talked to them kindly, and told them I was sorry to see so many of\r\nthem without homes. One of them, an intelligent-looking man, interrupted\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"We are not without homes,\" he said. \"I planted and worked on this place\r\nfor years before the war. It is right I should have some choice in the\r\nland the government promises us, and I have come here because I shall\r\nask for the land I have worked.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken, I am sure,\" I said. \"This farm belongs to my brother,\r\nnot to me. I am here through his kindness, and I am perfectly willing\r\nyou should remain through mine until you find other shelter, provided\r\nyou consider my husband master here, give no trouble, and help me clean\r\nup this place. All who are not willing to do this must leave. You must\r\ndistinctly understand this is private property which will be protected\r\nby the government.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so!\" said the guard, emphatically. Thereupon an old, gray-haired\r\nman stepped forth and said:—\r\n\r\n\"My name's Abram! I'se toted Marse Roger on my back to school many a\r\ntime. Me an' my family will stay an' clean up, an' thank you, Mistis!\r\nCome now! You all hear what the Yankee gentleman say! Git to work now\r\non them dead cows—hurry up!\"\r\n\r\nI sent Abram to the quartermaster, and borrowed a team to haul away the\r\nfilth and the dead animals. My faithful old friend in the kitchen lent\r\nme chairs and a table, and before night we were comparatively clean,\r\nhaving had a score or more scrubbers, and as many out-of-door laborers\r\nat work. My husband returned to us, and we commenced our new life of\r\nhopeless destitution. Not before October could I get my consent to eat\r\na morsel in the house. I took my meals under the trees, unless driven\r\nby the rains to the shelter of the porch. The old woman who had been so\r\nunreasonably happy—\"Sis' Winny\"—proved to be a mere atom of a creature,\r\nwithered, and bent almost double with age and infirmities, whom Aunt\r\nJinny had taken in out of sheer compassion. If she could find something\r\nfor which to thank God, surely none need despair.\r\n\r\nTo my great joy, my dear General had not remained in Richmond. There\r\nwas no hope there for immediate occupation. His profession of law, for\r\nwhich he had been educated, promised nothing, for the very good reason\r\nthat he had forgotten all he ever knew in his later profession of editor\r\nand politician. The latter field was closed to him forever. There was\r\nnothing for a rebel to earn in editing a newspaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nSTARTING LIFE ANEW\r\n\r\n\r\nWe suffered terribly during the ensuing months for want of something\r\nin which we might occupy ourselves. We sat silently, looking out on\r\na landscape marked here and there by chimneys standing sentinel over\r\nthe blackened heaps where our neighbors had made happy homes. A few\r\nbooks had been saved, only those for which we had little use. A soldier\r\nwalked in one day with a handsome volume which Jefferson Davis, after\r\ninscribing his name in it, had presented to the General. The soldier\r\ncalmly requested the former owner to be kind enough to add to the value\r\nof the volume by writing beneath the inscription his own autograph, and,\r\nhis request granted, walked off with it under his arm. \"He has been\r\nat some trouble,\" said my husband, \"and he had as well be happy if I\r\ncannot!\"\r\n\r\nAs the various brigades moved away from our neighborhood a few\r\nplain articles of furniture that had been taken from the house were\r\nrestored to us, but nothing handsome or valuable, no books, pictures,\r\n_bric-à-brac_, or house-furnishings of any kind—just a few chairs and\r\ntables. I had furnished an itemized list of all the articles we had\r\nlost, with only this result.\r\n\r\nWe had news after a while of our blooded mare, Lady Jane. A letter\r\nenclosing her photograph came from a New England officer:—\r\n\r\n     \"TO MR. PRYOR,\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR SIR: A very fine mare belonging to you came into my\r\n     camp near Richmond and is now with me. It would add much to\r\n     her value if I could get her pedigree. Kindly send it at your\r\n     earliest convenience, and oblige\r\n\r\n          \"Yours truly,\r\n               —— ——\r\n\r\n     \"P.S. The mare is in good health, as you will doubtless be\r\n     glad to know.\"\r\n\r\nDisposed as my General was to be amiable, this was a little too much!\r\nThe pedigree was not sent.\r\n\r\nA great number of tourists soon began to pass our house on their way\r\nto visit the localities near us, now become historic. They wished to\r\nstand on the site of General Lee's headquarters, to pluck a blade of\r\ngrass from the hollow of the crater, to visit the abattis, lunettes, and\r\nfortifications of both lines, especially Fort Steadman, Fort Gregg, and\r\nBattery 45, where the lines were broken the last of March and on April\r\n2.\r\n\r\nThese tourists, men and women, would pause at the well, some on\r\nhorseback, others in the dilapidated landaus or buggies for hire in\r\nPetersburg. Uncle Frank, with his flow of courteous language and his\r\nattractive manners, would usually meet and discourse to them, earning\r\nmany a _douceur_ by drawing from the well the cold water for which it\r\nwas famous. Abram's family was abroad in the fields, where the old man\r\nhad planted corn in June—too late to hope for other harvest than the\r\nfodder to feed the horse the quartermaster had given him at my earnest\r\nrequest. Under the impression that we were still working our negroes,\r\nsome of the tourists would dismount and harangue Abram at length upon\r\nhis \"rights.\" The old man would listen respectfully, shaking his gray\r\nhead dubiously as they rode off. \"Recollect, boy,\" said one of these\r\ntravellers to Alick, \"the white woman in that house is now _your_\r\nslave!\" Alick was standing beneath my window, amusing himself by tying\r\nup a rosebush. He looked up, simply advising me,—\"Let 'em go 'long,\"—and\r\nresumed his work in training the rosebush.\r\n\r\nSometimes the tourists would ask permission to call on us, claiming\r\nsome common acquaintance. My husband was inclined to resent this. Their\r\nsympathetic attitude was offensive to him. Like the Douglas he had\r\nendured much, but—\r\n\r\n     \"Last and worst, to spirit proud\r\n     To bear the pity of the crowd:\"—\r\n\r\nthis was more than he could endure.\r\n\r\nWe were perfectly aware that they wished to see _us_, and not to gain,\r\nas they affected, information about the historic localities on the farm.\r\nStill less did they desire ignobly to triumph over us. A boy, when\r\nhe tears off the wings of a fly, is much interested in observing its\r\nactions, not that he is cruel—far from it! He is only curious to see\r\nhow the creature will behave under very disadvantageous circumstances.\r\n\r\nOne day a clergyman called, with a card of introduction from Mrs.\r\nHartsuff, who had, I imagine, small discernment as regards clergymen.\r\nThis one was a smug little man,—sleek, unctuous, and trim, with\r\nPecksniffian self-esteem oozing out of every pore of his face.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Madam,\" he commenced, \"I trust I find you lying meekly under\r\nthe chastening rod of the Lord. I trust you can say 'it is good I was\r\nafflicted.'\"\r\n\r\nHaving no suitable answer just ready, I received his pious exhortation\r\nin silence. One can always safely do this with a clergyman.\r\n\r\n\"There are seasons,\" continued the good man, \"when chastisement must\r\nbe meted out to the transgressor; but if borne in the right spirit, the\r\nrod may blossom with blessings in the end.\"\r\n\r\nA little more of the same nature wrung from me the query, \"Are there\r\nnone on the other side who need the rod?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh—well, now—my dear lady! You must consider! You were in the wrong in\r\nthis unhappy contest, or, I should say, this most righteous war.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Væ victis!_\" I exclaimed. \"Our homes were invaded. We are on our own\r\nsoil!\"\r\n\r\nMy reverend brother grew red in the face. Rising and bowing himself out,\r\nhe sent me a Parthian arrow:—\r\n\r\n     \"No thief e'er felt the halter draw\r\n     With good opinion of the law.\"\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of a sultry day, a black cloud suddenly darkened the\r\nsky, thundered, lightened, and poured down a pelting storm of hailstones\r\nand rain. A party of young people galloped up to the gate, hastily\r\ndismounted, and ran for the shelter of our porch. There were half a\r\ndozen or more young girls and men. The small roof affording them scant\r\nshelter, I invited them into the parlor, where they stood dripping and\r\nshivering until a fire was kindled. A sudden cold wind came on with the\r\nhail. It had been a long time since I had seen happy, cheerful young\r\ngirls in their riding-habits, and I fell in love with them at once,\r\nputting them at ease, chafing their hands, and drying their little\r\ncoats. I never saw young folk so much embarrassed. They were Northern\r\ntourists, and felt the full force of our relative positions. When hot\r\ntea was brought in, they were overwhelmed. I was loath to give them\r\nup—these pretty girls. When they bade me good-by and thanked me for my\r\nnice tea and fire, the black eyes of one little beauty snapped with an\r\nunmistakable expression—\"for your coals of fire!\"\r\n\r\nSuch incidents as these were our only events. Our friends in town were\r\nin too much poverty and sorrow to visit us. A deadly silence and apathy\r\nhad succeeded the storm. It was a long time before the community waked\r\nup from this apathy—not, indeed, until the cool, invigorating weather\r\nof autumn. The blood-soaked soil and the dead animals emitted sickening\r\nodors until the frosts came to chain them up.\r\n\r\nA bachelor friend occasionally visited us and invited the little boys\r\nto accompany him upon relic-hunting expeditions to the narrow plain\r\nwhich had divided the opposing lines on that fateful April morning, just\r\nthree months before. Ropes were fastened around extinct shells, and they\r\nwere hauled in, to stand sentinel at the door. The shells were short\r\ncylinders, with one pointed end like a candle before it is lighted.\r\nNumbers of minie balls were dug out of the sand.\r\n\r\nOne day Mr. Kemp brought in a great curiosity—two bullets welded\r\ntogether, having been shot from opposing rifles.\r\n\r\nTwenty years afterward I showed this twin-bullet to General Grant, not\r\nlong before his last illness. With Mrs. Grant, he had called at my home\r\nin Brooklyn to inquire if I had good news of General Pryor, who was in\r\nEngland, having been sent by Irish Americans to see what could be done\r\nfor O'Donnell, the Irish prisoner. General Grant was much interested in\r\nthis case. He found me at my late breakfast of tea, toast, and a dozen\r\noysters, which were divided among the three of us. After breakfast I\r\nbrought out the bullet. He laid it on the palm of his hand and looked\r\nat it long and earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"See, General,\" I said, \"the bullets are welded together so as to form\r\na perfect horseshoe—a charm to keep away witches and evil spirits.\"\r\n\r\nBut the General was not interested in amulets, charms, or evil spirits.\r\nAfter regarding it silently for a moment, he remarked:—\r\n\r\n\"Those are minie balls, shot from rifles of equal caliber. And they\r\nmet precisely equidistant to a hair. This is very interesting, but it\r\nis not the only one in the world. I have seen one other, picked up at\r\nVicksburg. Where was this found and when?\" he asked, as he handed the\r\nrelic back to me. \"At Petersburg, possibly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I answered, \"but not when you were shelling the city. It was\r\npicked up on our farm after the last fight.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with a humorous twinkle in his eye. \"Now look here,\" he\r\nsaid, \"don't you go about telling people I shelled Petersburg.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Met Bullets found near Fort Gregg, 1865.]\r\n\r\nA short time before his death, just before he was taken to Mount\r\nMcGregor, he dictated a note to me, sending his kind regards to my\r\nGeneral, and saying he remembered with pleasure his talk with me over\r\na cup of tea.\r\n\r\nBut we must return (and I am sure I am pardoned for this digression) to\r\nthe weary life of enforced idleness at the cottage.\r\n\r\nI had no garments to mend or to make, no household to manage. The sultry\r\ndays were begun and rounded by hours of listless endurance, followed\r\nby troubled sleep. A bag of army \"hardtack\" stood in a corner, so the\r\nchildren were never hungry. Presently they, too, sat around us, too\r\nlistless to play or talk. A great army of large, light brown Norway rats\r\nnow overran the farm. They would walk to the corner before our eyes and\r\nhelp themselves to the army ration. We never moved a finger to drive\r\nthem away. After a while Alick appeared with an enormous black-and-white\r\ncat.\r\n\r\n\"Dis is jest a leetle mo'n I can stand,\" said Alick. \"De Yankees\r\nhas stole ev'rything, and dug up de whole face o' the yearth—and de\r\nJews comes all de time and pizens de well, droppin' down chains an'\r\ngrapplin'-irons to see ef we all has hid silver—but I ain' obleedged to\r\nstan' sassyness fum dese outlandish rats.\"\r\n\r\nAlick had to surrender. The very first night after the arrival of his\r\nvaliant cat there was a scuffle in the room where the crackers were\r\nkept, a chair was overturned, and a flying cat burst through the hall,\r\npursued by three or four huge rats. The cat took refuge in a tree, and,\r\nstealthily descending at an opportune moment, stole away and left the\r\nfield to the enemy.\r\n\r\nOf course there could be but one result from this life. Malaria had hung\r\nover us for weeks, and now one after another of the children lay down\r\nupon the \"pallets\" on the floor, ill with fever. Then I succumbed and\r\nwas violently ill. Our only nurse was my dear General; and not in all\r\nthe years when he never shirked duty, or lost a march, or rode on his\r\nown horse when his men had a toilsome march or if one of them failed by\r\nthe way, and never lost one of the battles into which he personally led\r\nthem,—not in all those trying times was he nobler, grander, than in his\r\nlong and lonely vigils beside his sick family. And most nobly did the\r\naged negress in the kitchen stand by us. My one fevered vision was of\r\nan ebony angel!\r\n\r\nAfter we recovered, my dear husband was ill—ague and fever had fastened\r\non him. When he, too, grew better, he would sit for days in hopeless\r\ndespair, looking out on the desolate landscape.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hartsuff and his wife often visited us. They were terribly\r\nafraid of fever, and would send in messages from the gate while we\r\nwere all so ill. But after we had recovered, General Hartsuff came\r\nhimself—and finally sent Captain Gregory, the commissary-general, to\r\nsee me, and to reason seriously with me about the necessity of sending\r\nGeneral Pryor away. He had never been pardoned. There were men in power\r\nwho constantly hinted at punishment and retribution. General Pryor\r\nwould die here. He should go to New York, go by sea, shake off the\r\nchills that shook him so relentlessly every third day, meet friends\r\n(many Southerners were in New York), and something might result for his\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nThis idea grew in our minds as feasible, if only we had the money. It\r\nhad never occurred to me to make a second attempt (one had failed) to\r\nsell my watch. I now took it to a banker in Petersburg, added to it a\r\ncherished antique cameo set in diamonds which had never left my finger\r\nsince it was given me, like Shylock's turquoise from his Leah, when my\r\nhusband \"was a bachelor.\" Leaving these in pledge, I received three\r\nhundred dollars. I bought some quinine forthwith, ordered a suit of\r\nclothes to replace the threadbare Confederate gray, and sent Roger A.\r\nPryor, the sometime \"rebel,\" to New York, upon an experiment of which\r\nthe most sanguine imagination could not have foreseen the successful\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nA difficult task lay before him. Ruined in fortune, his occupation gone,\r\nhis friends dead or impoverished, his health impaired, his heart broken,\r\nhe had yet to win support for a wife and seven children, and that in\r\na hostile community. Only two things were left to him—the ability to\r\nwork and the willingness to work. With what courage he commenced the\r\nstudy of his profession, what difficulties he surmounted, what rebuffs\r\nhe bore with fortitude, I can give here no adequate idea. He labored\r\nincessantly, often breaking down and fainting, at his task. In one of\r\nhis early letters he says, \"Sometimes I sink in despair; but then I\r\nrally and press on. Don't you think heaven will prosper me for _your_\r\nsake? The obstacles to the success of 'a rebel' in this city are almost\r\ninsurmountable.\"\r\n\r\nHe accepted a position on the _Daily News_ which yielded him twenty-five\r\ndollars a week. Meanwhile he must learn New York law.\r\n\r\nThere has been too much sorrow already in this story. Why tell of all\r\nthe anguish, all the suffering of the next years? During the long,\r\nlonely winter of 1865 my husband nobly strove to sustain my hopes, and\r\nfor his sake I would not allow my heart to break.\r\n\r\nEarly in February old Abram, the faithful servant in whose care my\r\nhusband left me, announced that we had reached the end of all our\r\nresources at Cottage Farm. Rose, the little cow, had died, the turnips\r\nand potatoes Abram had raised were all gone, the two pigs he had\r\nreared had fulfilled their destiny long ago, and the government rations\r\nhad ceased. He \"could scuffle along himself, but 't wa'n't no use to\r\npertend\" he could \"take care of Mistis an' the chilluns, not like they\r\nought to be took care of.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must not despair, Abram,\" I said. \"We'll feed the children, never\r\nfear! I must plan something to help.\"\r\n\r\n\"Plannin' ain't no 'count, Mistis, less'n you got sump'n to work on.\r\nWhat we all goin' to do for wood?\"\r\n\r\n\"What you have done all along, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"No'm. Dat's onpossible. We done burn up Fort Gregg an' Battery 45. Der\r\nain' no mo' fortifications on de place as I knows of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fortifications!\" I exclaimed. \"Why, Abram! you surely haven't been\r\nburning the fortifications?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hit's des like I tell you, Mistis. De las' stick's on yo' wood-pile\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Abram,\" I said gravely, \"if we have destroyed our\r\nfortifications—burned our bridges—the time has come to change our base.\r\nWe will move into town.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, without food or fuel, and without Abram, we could not live in\r\nthe country. The fields were a desolate waste, with no fences to protect\r\na possible crop or to keep cattle within bounds. Abram saw no hope from\r\ncultivation—nothing to \"work on.\" He had been a refugee from a lower\r\nplantation, and he was now inclined to put out his children to service,\r\nand return in his old age to his old home and to his old master, who\r\nlonged to welcome him. He was a grand old man. I doubt not he has a warm\r\nplace in the bosom of that other Abram, the faithful, but no whit more\r\nfaithful than he.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon before our departure from Cottage Farm, the weather was so\r\ndeliciously balmy that I walked over the garden and grounds, thinking\r\nof the great drama that had been enacted on this spot. The spring\r\ncomes early in the lower counties of Virginia. Already the grass was\r\nspringing, and on the trees around the well which had so often refreshed\r\nGeneral Lee, tender young leaves were trembling. Our old friends the\r\ntourists now appeared at intervals, taking in this historic ground on\r\ntheir return from Florida or South Carolina, where they had spent the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nThe garden, which at this season had always blossomed with early\r\nhyacinths, daffodils, snowdrops, and the rosy spikes of the flowering\r\nalmond, was now a ploughed and trampled waste of weeds. Under the\r\niron-clad hoofs of the cavalry horses, and the heavy wheels of the\r\ngun-carriages, the life had been crushed out of the tender bulbs. Spring\r\nhad come to touch all scars with her gentle finger-tips. Over all the\r\nbattle-torn ground, over the grave of the young soldier who had lain so\r\nlong under my window, over the track ploughed by shot and shell, she had\r\nspread a delicate bloom like a smile on the lips of the dead. A bit of\r\ncolor attracted my attention, and stooping over a bramble-bush I found,\r\nunder its protection, a single spike of pink hyacinth. When I arose with\r\nthe treasure in my hand, I saw that an elderly gentleman had alighted\r\nfrom his \"buggy\" and was gravely considering me. He bared his head and\r\nintroduced himself. \"Madame, I am a Northern traveller. Will you give\r\nme that little flower as a souvenir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Take it!\" I said; there was nothing else left, his people had all the\r\nrest—and with effusive bows and thanks he stumbled over the briers and\r\nuneven ground to secure his delicate souvenir of a battle-ground.\r\n\r\nMuch of my last night at Cottage Farm was spent at the window from which\r\nI had watched on that anxious night of my first home-coming. The home\r\nhad been polluted, sacked, desecrated—and yet I was leaving it with\r\nregret. Many a hard battle with illness, with want, with despair, had\r\nbeen fought within those walls. It seemed like a long dark night in\r\nwhich neither sun nor moon nor stars had appeared; during which we had\r\nsimply endured, watching ourselves the while, jealous lest the natural\r\nrebound of youthful hope and spirit should surprise us, and dishonor\r\nthose who had suffered and bled and died for our sakes.\r\n\r\nBut now the night was gone, the hour of awakening had come. There was\r\nwork for me to do in the world; the world in which I had been divinely\r\ntaught I should \"have tribulation\" with the command and promise, \"Fear\r\nnot! I have overcome the world.\" And so, as I sat again in the darkness,\r\nand kept my midnight vigil:—\r\n\r\n     As of old when the fire and tempest had passed,\r\n     And an earthquake had riven the rocks, the Word\r\n     In a still small voice rose over the blast,\r\n               The voice of the Lord.\r\n\r\n     And the Voice said—\"Take up your life again,\r\n     Quit yourself manfully, stand in your lot;\r\n     Let the Fever, the Famine, the peril, the pain,\r\n               Be all forgot.\"\r\n\r\nThat I might aid my husband to mend our fortunes, I persuaded seven\r\nof my neighbors' children to take music lessons from me. I had been\r\ncarefully instructed in music, having been taught by a pupil of Liszt's,\r\nbrought over by the Hon. William C. Rives at the close of his second\r\nterm as Minister to the Court of Louis Philippe, to teach his own\r\ndaughter Amélie. So I was well equipped for my new duties, upon which,\r\ndespite my own persistent chills and fevers, I entered with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST \"DECORATION DAY\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in May of this year 1866 that we inaugurated, in Petersburg, the\r\ncustom, now universal, of decorating the graves of those who fell in\r\nthe Civil War. Our intention was simply to lay a token of our gratitude\r\nand affection upon the graves of the brave citizens who fell June 9,\r\n1864, in defence of Petersburg, and upon the graves of her sons who\r\nperished in the assault upon Fort Steadman. These were buried in the\r\ncemetery of the old Blandford Church, then a roofless, ivy-clad ruin.\r\nThe church is one of the historic structures of the South, and it has\r\na literature of its own among Virginians. One of the most striking of\r\nthe poems concerning it was the following, found written with a pencil\r\non the inner walls of the church many years ago. The author is unknown,\r\nbut Tyrone Power, the Irish comedian, is generally supposed to have been\r\nthe writer:—\r\n\r\n     \"Thou art crumbling to the dust, old pile!\r\n       Thou art hastening to thy fall;\r\n     And 'round thee in thy loneliness\r\n       Clings the ivy to the wall;\r\n     The worshippers are scattered now,\r\n       Who knelt before thy shrine,\r\n     And silence reigns where anthems rose\r\n       In days of 'auld lang syne.'\r\n\r\n     \"And sadly sighs the wandering wind\r\n       Where oft in years gone by\r\n     Prayer rose from many hearts to Him,\r\n       The Highest of the High.\r\n     The tread of many a noiseless foot\r\n       That sought thy aisles is o'er,\r\n     And many a weary heart that beat\r\n       Is stilled forever more.\r\n\r\n     \"How doth ambition's hope take wing!\r\n       How droops the spirit now!\r\n     We hear the distant city's din;\r\n       The dead are mute below.\r\n     The sun that shone upon their path\r\n       Now gilds their lowly graves,\r\n     The zephyr which once fanned their brows\r\n       The grass above them waves.\r\n\r\n     \"Oh! could we call the many back\r\n       Who've gathered here in vain,—\r\n     Who've careless roved where we do now,\r\n       Who'll never meet again;\r\n     How would our very hearts be stirred\r\n       To meet the earnest gaze\r\n     Of the lovely and the beautiful—\r\n       The lights of other days!\"\r\n\r\nWhen a sentiment and observance sweeps the country we naturally wonder\r\nwho began it. Where was the spark kindled that fired the train? Who was\r\nthe \"founder\"—that is, the originator, the one from whom the movement\r\nderived its beginning?\r\n\r\nMemorial associations were organized in several places soon after the\r\nclose of the war, but the first observance of a \"Decoration Day\" was\r\nan inspiration of Mrs. Judge Joynes of Petersburg, Virginia. She called\r\nthe women of Petersburg together on the 9th of May, 1866, and organized\r\nthem into a memorial association for the express purpose of decorating\r\nthe graves of the men who had fallen in the late conflict between the\r\nNorth and the South. She was made President of the association, and Mrs.\r\nSamuel B. Paul, Vice-President. The following preamble was offered by\r\nMrs. Joynes and accepted by the meeting:—\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, a mysterious Providence has given us a duty which would, under\r\nother results, have been a nation's pride to perform, we, the ladies of\r\nPetersburg, now assume our share of the melancholy yet grateful task\r\nof doing honor to the remains of her noble sons. All along our lines,\r\non distant hilltops, in valleys, in forests, lie the neglected graves\r\nof the slain of our people. Absent from our homes and our altars, they\r\nsleep the last sleep of the noble and the brave. Their bodies, bone of\r\nour bone, flesh of our flesh, arise, a spectre band before us, demanding\r\nChristian and honorable sepulture. Untrue would we be to the instincts\r\nof nature, as well as our birthright of glory, untrue to the land of\r\nWashington and of Lee, did we not give every energy to this work. Now\r\nthat the storms of war have been hushed for us, and the paralysis of our\r\ncrushed hopes is yielding to a healthy activity and responsibility, we\r\ncome together to devise means to perpetuate our gratitude and admiration\r\nfor those who died for us. We, therefore, form ourselves into a society\r\nfor the systematic furtherance of this object, inviting the coöperation\r\nof all that sympathize with us, so that here, where the last blow was\r\nstruck, an enduring monument may arise as a tribute to true manhood and\r\npatriotic devotion.\r\n\r\n\"We, therefore, propose,\" etc. In the resolutions that followed, June 9\r\nwas named as the day for \"perpetual remembrance.\" Just what was to be\r\ndone on that day was not made public. The Federal Army was still with\r\nus, and some apprehension was felt that we might be hindered in our\r\nwishes. Nothing was yet quite settled or clearly understood in relation\r\nto our future. We were under military rule, and realized the necessity\r\nof discreet behavior. Mrs. Joynes quietly circulated notes among us,\r\nrequesting us to meet at Blandford Church on the afternoon of June 9,\r\n\"to be sure of enough voices for an anthem.\" It was whispered that \"many\r\nflowers were desired.\" When the day came, everybody rose early, to cut\r\nthese flowers with the dew on them—otherwise they would perish in the\r\nhot summer day.\r\n\r\nOver the trellised porch of the house I had occupied during the siege of\r\nPetersburg there was still the fine specimen of the microphylla rose—a\r\ngrand climbing rose to whose bounty my little girls had been indebted,\r\nduring the blockade, for the only adornment of the home-plaited hats.\r\nThis rose had, as we have seen, already yielded its tribute to heroism.\r\nIts globes of snow had lain upon the breast of more than one dead\r\nsoldier. To-day it gave up all its wealth for the hands of my little\r\nchildren and my own. The day was perfect. One could but recall that\r\nother perfect day when so many of the old men and boys had fallen in the\r\ndefence of the town. The flowering trees,—chestnut, locust, and peerless\r\n_magnolia grandiflora_ were again in blossom. The city again lay under\r\na cloud of white. In all the town, lately one of the wealthiest of the\r\nSouth, only two or three carriages could be found. These led the way,\r\nfilled with flowers. Young girls followed, clad in white and bearing\r\ngarlands of flowers—a long double line. Then came every child from every\r\nschool. All bore baskets and clusters of flowers. Some had covered large\r\npasteboard letters with white roses, combining them afterward to form\r\nthe tender words of \"Brother\" or \"Father.\" The women and children were\r\nfollowed by a band playing Beethoven's immortal march upon the death of\r\na hero. Military companies and a great crowd of reverent strangers made\r\nup the rear.\r\n\r\nThe day at one o'clock, when the procession started, was intensely\r\nhot, and the distance to be traversed along a dusty road more than a\r\nmile. Upon reaching the cemetery of the old Blandford Church a prayer\r\nwas offered, followed by orations, at two graves—one filled with the\r\nbones of men who had perished at Fort Steadman, the other the grave of\r\nColonel Scott, who fell at Richmond during the seven days' fight. Then\r\nthe women and children hastened to cover with flowers the great number\r\nof unmarked graves. Many little white flags had been prepared for these\r\ngraves. On these the words \"Somebody's darling\" was printed. I remember\r\nMiss Joynes's delicate beauty as she filled her arms with these little\r\nbanners and ran from one lonely hillock to another to plant them. We\r\nthen gathered together in the historic church, roofless then, and in a\r\nmost picturesque phase of decay. But the anthem written by Mrs. Morrison\r\nwas deemed too passionate for the hour. We wished to do nothing that\r\nmight be construed amiss. The Federal soldiers were all around us,\r\nlooking on respectfully; so we raised our eyes to heaven through the\r\nold ivy-clad walls and sang to the good old church tune:—\r\n\r\n     \"Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah,\r\n     Pilgrims in a stricken land.\"\r\n\r\nWhen all was over the sorrowful women and children returned mournfully\r\nto their homes. The shops of the city were closed, the streets hushed.\r\nThus passed the first organized observance of Decoration Day. It has\r\nbeen observed in a similar manner on some selected day in every State\r\nin the Union, but in Petersburg it will ever be on the 9th of June, her\r\none saddest, greatest day of the war, that her daughters will cover with\r\nflowers the graves of her martyred sons.\r\n\r\nI think well of my country that it should recognize them as martyrs.\r\nWe do well to pause one summer day in a year to exalt their courage,\r\nto bewail their fate, to cover their humble hillocks with flowers.\r\nThey died, not to protect our land from the profane foot of the foreign\r\ninvader, nor yet to win the Holy Sepulchre from the infidel, nor yet to\r\nconquer a savage wilderness for the great incoming flood of our race.\r\nThey died because their country could devise, in its wisdom, no better\r\nmeans of settling a family quarrel than by slaying her sons with the\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nMay this country never forget to observe Memorial Day! Even now there is\r\nscarcely a hamlet in the United States that does not display a tiny flag\r\nor bit of bunting on Decoration Day. Some years ago I drove through a\r\nwild mountain country in West Virginia. Deep down in a narrow gorge—one\r\nof those strange fissures where a small stream has cut a mountain in\r\ntwain—I discovered a wretched hut. Fastened to a pole at the door was a\r\nfluttering bit of red flannel. The half-naked savages who lived in this\r\nhut scrambled up the precipice to beg. I asked the meaning of the red\r\nrag, and received the surprised answer, \"Decoration Day!\" These untamed,\r\nuntamable people respected the day.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: OLD BLANDFORD CHURCH, PETERSBURG, VA.]\r\n\r\nThe old Blandford Church is still an object of interest to all who\r\nvisit the historic sites around Petersburg. When the solemn chant of the\r\nfirst Memorial, or Decoration Day, service echoed through its mouldering\r\nwalls, they, with a remnant of the roof, were embedded in the emerald\r\nivy brought from Kenilworth, and were literally vocal with hundreds\r\nof tuneful birds. It has been found necessary to repair the roof,\r\nbut enough ivy remains to cover it in a few years. Meanwhile the old\r\nchurch sits desolate among the graves of her distinguished and honored\r\nsons—indeed a _Mater Dolorosa_:—\r\n\r\n           \"Childless and crownless\r\n           In her voiceless woe\r\n     An empty urn within her withered hands,\r\n     Whose holy dust was scattered long ago.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there she watches \"until the day dawn and the shadows flee away.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA IN THE EARLY DAYS OF PEACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result of the war was to leave the state of Virginia prostrate.\r\nIt seemed it would require generations for the commonwealth to recover\r\nfrom the effects of the strife upon her own soil, the paralysis of the\r\nmerchant and the farmer, and the consequent starvation of the people.\r\nAnd yet the people refused to repine. They accepted their lot with\r\npatience, fortitude, and dignity. Whatever they may have felt, they\r\nforbore to give expression to indignation or to nurse old grudges.\r\nNorthern men who visited them were treated with courtesy. General Ordway\r\nof the Federal Army records that \"in Richmond the people behaved with\r\nbecoming reserve and dignity. I found them reasonable, courteous, and\r\ndesirous of submitting to or coöperating with every measure necessary to\r\ngood government. I rode through the state for several weeks accompanied\r\nonly by a mounted orderly, and never failed to receive the traditional\r\nhospitality of Virginia.\"[26]\r\n\r\nIn recalling this time I cannot remember one word of bitterness or\r\ncomplaint. When women met together there was talk only of \"ways and\r\nmeans,\" the best to be done under the new order of things.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 the state was under Federal government. Francis H. Pierpont, who\r\nhad been Governor of West Virginia, assumed executive authority. In 1867\r\nVirginia was placed under military government, and in the winter of that\r\nyear a convention was held which framed a new constitution. This was\r\nsubmitted in 1869 to the people, and was adopted by a large majority.\r\nGilbert C. Walker, a native of New York and a resident of Virginia, was\r\nelected Governor; United States Senators were chosen; the Fourteenth\r\nand Fifteenth Amendments were ratified; the military occupation, which\r\nhad been found unnecessary, ceased; and Virginia resumed her place in\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nAs to the negroes, they gave no trouble. Individual cases of\r\ndiscourteous behavior were treated as they deserved, with compassionate\r\nforbearance. \"You will know better by and by,\" I said to a negro woman\r\nwho insisted upon buying her pins and needles before I was served, and\r\nshe respectfully yielded me her place at the counter. Once when dear\r\nold Mrs. Campbell, the venerated mother of Virginia's historian, stopped\r\nwith me in a vacant street for a lengthy comparison of household notes,\r\na negro policeman sauntered up and said gruffly: \"You can't block up\r\ndis street! You suttenly is got to 'move on.'\" \"And so we will—and\r\nso we will!\" said the old lady, laughing. I remember on the fourth of\r\nJuly, 1866, my Mary was ill, nervous, and distressed by the firing of a\r\ntoy pistol under her window. I found a young negro man quietly sitting\r\non the curb and loading, with percussion caps, a small pistol. To my\r\nsomewhat heated remonstrance, he solemnly and without the least anger\r\nremarked, \"Ah does ma work, an' Ah pays ma taxes, an' _Ah has ma fun_,\"\r\nand went on with his percussion caps. I thought there was reason in\r\nhis conclusion and only regretted the work and taxes of the white man\r\nwithout the \"fun\"!\r\n\r\nThe position of the newly enfranchised negro was a most perplexing one,\r\nand in it he bore himself with wonderful discretion. Every possible\r\ninfluence was brought to bear upon him, to make him distrust his old\r\nfriends and leave his old home. Early in the war he had elected for\r\nhimself an attitude of perfect quiescence. The fight was a white man's\r\nfight. \"But,\" reasoned one of his early advisers, \"the fight is for\r\nyour freedom; the whole trouble is about you.\" \"That's so!\" answered an\r\nold man of the \"Uncle Remus\" type. \"When two dogs fight, they commonly\r\nfights for a bone. Is you ever see the bone fight?\" But after the\r\nconflict was over the negro realized that his new blessings brought\r\nwith them stern anxieties. Never having thought for himself, he was now\r\nthe prey of the ill-advised counsels of his new friends. Painful things\r\noccurred in our households. I never found my little Lizzie, who left\r\nme after the surrender of Petersburg. One day I surprised my husband's\r\ngentle mother in tears, because of the condition of a small servant who\r\nhad returned to her after wandering through the country, and who was now\r\nsmitten with fever. My sister had reared a superb young woman, Clara,\r\nwhom we all loved and respected. She too disappeared, to be mourned by\r\nthe entire family. Six months after she left, my brother was aroused\r\nlate at night by a violent ringing at the door. His wife entreated him\r\nnot to open the door, for these sudden alarms were to be dreaded; but he\r\nsaid, \"I must—I cannot help thinking Clara may return.\" When the door\r\nwas opened in the midnight darkness, a small trunk was hastily thrust\r\nin by an unseen hand, and Clara fell across the threshold. She never\r\nspoke again! Next day she died, and in her slender stock of clothing\r\nthere was no word, no clew, to solve the mystery of her death.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1865 Congress directed that an amendment to the Constitution\r\nshould be submitted to all the states, prescribing that \"neither\r\nslavery nor involuntary servitude\" should thenceforth exist in the\r\nUnited States. I don't know how this amendment was received by other\r\nstates. Virginia adopted it at once, and the new-made citizen took\r\nhis place there as a constituent part of the American people. \"Every\r\nbarrier between the races was levelled to the ground as far as the\r\naction of the Federal government could effect it. The Africans were\r\nnow the political equals of all other Americans. They were competent\r\nto vote, to preside on the bench, to command in the army, to represent\r\nthe country at foreign courts, to sit in the Senate, and to officiate\r\nas governors of states, and as Presidents of the United States. It is\r\nnot surprising that President Lincoln, walking through the streets of\r\nRichmond after the surrender, should have gazed with 'a pathetic wonder'\r\non the African crowd around him. By his act they had become citizens,\r\nand it is possible that he wondered at the probable result.\"[27]\r\n\r\nFar different has been the treatment, by this country, of our only\r\noriginal native Americans—the North American Indians!\r\n\r\nThe story of \"reconstruction,\" and of the pangs and throes through which\r\nVirginia worked out her salvation, has been told by an abler pen than\r\nmine. Nor can I follow further the fortunes of our own family, of our\r\nstruggle for existence in a new home, of our final reward. This will\r\nbe a story for another book. Eighteen months after my husband left me\r\nI had the following letter from him:—\r\n\r\n     \"Don't imagine I have the least idea of abandoning my\r\n     experiment here. I mean 'to fight it out on this line,' to\r\n     the end of the struggle. My practice increases slowly, but\r\n     is based, I believe, on a conviction of my competency. Thank\r\n     God, what I have accomplished, though small, has been achieved\r\n     by my own unaided exertions and without the least obligation\r\n     to a human being. I have no patron. I have never solicited\r\n     business. My only arts are study and devotion to duty. These\r\n     expedients may be slow of operation but they are sure, and\r\n     they leave my dignity and self-respect uncompromised. I am\r\n     not conscious of having received a favor since my residence\r\n     in New York: and when the victory is achieved, I shall have\r\n     inexpressible satisfaction in saying, with Coriolanus—'_alone_\r\n     I did it!' When I speak of 'favors,' I mean in the way of my\r\n     profession. Of some personal kindness I have been the grateful\r\n     recipient,—though not in many instances.\"\r\n\r\nWithin two years I followed him with our children; and if I cannot\r\nsay with Mr. Burke, \"my adopted and my _dearer_\" home, yet so warm and\r\nabounding was the welcome accorded us that we are attached to it by the\r\nstrongest ties of gratitude and affection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last time I visited Petersburg I drove out to her battle-fields.\r\nNature had hidden the scars with beauty. The seeds of the daisy had been\r\nscattered wherever the Federal forces had been encamped, and they had\r\nwhitened the fields and covered the graves by the wayside. Nature had\r\nnot forgotten these lonely unmarked graves, nor will she ever forget,\r\nuntil time shall be no more.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to write about the dreadful war between the North and the\r\nSouth. We press our breasts against a thorn when we recall the anguish\r\nof those days of death and disaster. It is often said that it is still\r\ntoo early to write the story of our Civil War. It will soon be too late.\r\nSome of us still live who saw those days. We should not shrink from\r\nrecording what we know to be true. Thus only will a full history of\r\nAmerican courage and fidelity be preserved,—for all were Americans. The\r\nglory of one is the glory of all—in 1861 when brothers were in conflict,\r\nas well as in 1898 when they stood shoulder to shoulder and heart to\r\nheart against a foreign foe. Circumstances do not rule the heart, and\r\n\"where the heart is right, there is true patriotism.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [1] \"Life of Oliphant,\" Vol. I. p. 109.\r\n\r\n     [2] J. F.
