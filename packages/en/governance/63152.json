To most Canadians of to-day he is little more\r\nthan a name, but still he played an important part in the stirring\r\nevents of our political life fourscore years ago.  He lacked the\r\npicturesqueness of that extraordinary personage, his predecessor in\r\noffice, Sir Francis Bond Head, and he was overshadowed completely by\r\nboth Lord Durham to Poulett Thomson, better known as Lord Sydenham,\r\nwho were in succession as Governors-General placed in authority over\r\nhim.  None the less he lives in Canadian history as the man who\r\nrefused to reprieve Lount and Matthews, and who made common cause\r\nwith the Family Compact against the Reformers.  Although nominally he\r\nwas Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada from his appointment in 1837\r\nuntil the Act of Union went into force, his real term of office\r\nlasted only a little more than a year and a half, from March 23rd,\r\n1838, until November 22nd, 1839.  After that time he was directly\r\nsubordinate to Sydenham.  During that brief period Sir George Arthur\r\nproved himself an energetic if not always merciful governor.\r\n\r\nIt was unfortunate that Arthur come to Upper Canada at a time when\r\nMackenzie's rebellion had just been crushed and when party feeling\r\nwas still running very high.  Sir Francis Bond Head left Toronto on\r\nthe very day that Sir George Arthur arrived and so the new\r\nLieutenant-Governor was unable to obtain much information from his\r\npredecessor.  There is reason to believe, none the less, that Sir\r\nFrancis put in a good word for his old friends the Family Compact and\r\nthat Arthur from the beginning of his term of office favoured that\r\nparty.  In his first official despatch to Lord Glenelg dated March\r\n29th, 1838, Sir George makes mention of the \"large preponderating\r\nparty looking to the Executive Government to put down treason by\r\nenergetic measures,\" as opposed to \"the party styling themselves\r\nReformers\" who were \"hoping for the most lenient course.\"[1]  These\r\nphrases, written when Arthur had been only about a week in Upper\r\nCanada, stamp the new governor at once as an opponent of reform.  If\r\nfurther proof is needed it can readily be found in Arthur's reply to\r\na congratulatory address from seven hundred and fifty citizens of\r\nToronto upon the occasion of his arrival in that city.  In that\r\naddress reference was made to the fact that \"in the promotion of\r\npublic order, and the adoption of measures for the pacification of\r\nthe country\" Arthur would have \"the prompt and energetic support of\r\nthe loyal, patriotic and constitutional reformers of the Province.\"\r\nIn his reply Sir George Arthur regretted that \"any portion of the\r\ninhabitants of this city should have felt it necessary at the moment\r\nto present themselves under the character of reformers, as a distinct\r\nclass of the people of this Province.\"  Such a statement was not\r\nlikely to secure for Sir George Arthur the whole-hearted support of\r\nall the well-disposed citizens of Toronto.  The execution of Lount\r\nand Matthews further alienated the more moderate men in the Province.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Francis Head arrived in Toronto he was greeted by placards\r\nwhich designated him as \"a Tried Reformer.\"[2]  When Sir George\r\nArthur was appointed to succeed him the London _Atlas_, on March 3rd,\r\n1838, enquired, \"What will the inhabitants of Upper Canada think of\r\nthe appointment of the Governor of a penal Colony to rule over a\r\nprovince of freemen?\"[3]  As a matter of fact, Arthur was an\r\nimprovement on Head but he was never able to shake off his past\r\ntraditions or to obtain as Lord Durham and Lord Sydenham did, a real\r\ninsight into Upper Canadian conditions.  Durham, it is true, in his\r\nReport is not nearly so successful when he deals with the upper\r\nprovince as when he portrays the miseries of Lower Canada, but he\r\nunderstood the situation there better than Head or Arthur ever did.\r\nSydenham's ideas as to the workings of Responsible Government did not\r\nharmonize with those of Lord Elgin, but he never would have argued\r\nagainst it, as Arthur did, on the grounds that it was demanded by the\r\nReformers.  From start to finish of his term of office in Upper\r\nCanada Sir George Arthur was unable to forget his experience in\r\nBritish Honduras where he quelled a negro insurrection and in Van\r\nDiemen's Land, now Tasmania, where he was called upon to rule a\r\nconvict settlement.  Above all he was a military officer, and as such\r\nwas none too ready to season justice with mercy.  He was the last of\r\nthat series of Lieutenant-Governors of Upper Canada who were also\r\nmilitary officers and he possessed the defects of his qualities.\r\nStern, unbending, narrow-minded, but entirely honest he was totally\r\nunable to see his opponent's point of view.\r\n\r\nBy training Sir George Arthur was a soldier.  Before he ever embarked\r\non his administrative career as governor of one colonial dependency\r\nafter another he had served many years in the army.  Born in 1784,\r\nthe youngest son of John Arthur of Norley House, Plymouth, George\r\nArthur entered the army at the age of twenty.  He saw service in\r\nItaly, Egypt--where he was wounded at Rosetta in 1807--and also in\r\nSicily in 1808.  He took part in the ill-fated Walcheren Expedition\r\nof 1809 and seems to have distinguished himself in it, since we read\r\nthat he was thanked in general orders and also that he received the\r\nfreedom of the city of London.  After being military secretary to Sir\r\nGeorge Don, the governor of the island of Jersey; Arthur, in 1812,\r\nbecame a major in the Seventh West India Regiment.  We next find him\r\nin Jamaica as assistant quartermaster-general of the forces on that\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nIn 1814 George Arthur became Lieutenant-Governor of British Honduras\r\n\"with the rank of colonel on the staff.\"[4]  This office, which was\r\nboth civil and military, Arthur held until 1822, during which time he\r\nsuppressed a serious revolt of the slave population.  His despatches\r\non the subject of slavery we are told attracted the attention of the\r\ngreat abolitionist, William Wilberforce.  In 1822 Colonel Arthur\r\nreturned to England on leave of absence in order to furnish the\r\nBritish Government with additional information on the subject of the\r\nemancipation of slaves.  It was during this stay in England that he\r\nwas in 1824 appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen's Land and at\r\nthe same time commander of the military forces in that penal colony.\r\n\r\nFor twelve years George Arthur grappled with the terrible conditions\r\nexisting in that most unfortunate island.  The transportation system,\r\none of the worst blots in British colonial history, was then at its\r\nheight and its evils were only too apparent.  The Select Committee on\r\nTransportation appointed by the British Parliament in its Report\r\nsubmitted in 1838, having outlined the unspeakable conditions\r\nexisting at Norfolk Island, goes on to make the following statement\r\nregarding Van Diemen's Land:\r\n\r\n\"Your Committee will not lengthen this report by describing the penal\r\nsettlements of Van Diemen's Land, where the severity of the system is\r\nas great as, if not greater than, that at Norfolk Island, where\r\nculprits are as reckless, if not more reckless, commissing murder\"\r\n(to use the words of Sir George Arthur) \"in order to enjoy the\r\nexcitement of being sent up to Hobart Town for trial, though aware\r\nthat in the ordinary course they must be executed within a fortnight\r\nafter arrival.\"[5]\r\n\r\nAs Lieutenant-Governor of such a colony Colonel Arthur was called\r\nupon to act with firmness and often with severity.  His biographer in\r\nthe Dictionary of National Biography, Sir Alexander John Arbuthnot,\r\nK.C.S.I., claims that the object of Arthur's appointment was \"the\r\nintroduction of an improved system\" of treatment for the convicts.\r\nArthur sought to adopt \"a middle course between the extreme severity\r\nof the system which would make transportation simply deterrent and\r\nthe over-indulgence of the system which aimed at reforming the\r\nconvict by gentler treatment.  He held that it was possible to make\r\ntransportation a punishment much dreaded by criminals whilst offering\r\nevery facility for reform to those who were not hardened in crime;\r\nbut he entertained no quixotic expectations of frequent\r\nreformation.\"[6]  It will be seen from this quotation that Arthur\r\nbelieved in the transportation system in a modified and \"improved\"\r\nform.  In this he ran counter to the wishes of the colonists who\r\ndesired that an end be put to the abomination.  Arthur's biographer\r\nregrets that \"the colonists and their friends in England were bent on\r\nputting an end to the transportation system and their views\r\nultimately prevailed.\"\r\n\r\nThis difference of opinion between Arthur and the colonists furnished\r\nW. L. MacKenzie with some of his choicest bits of invective against\r\nthe new Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada.  In his _Gazette_,\r\nMacKenzie prefaced a long series of excerpts from the newspapers of\r\nVan Diemen's Land on the occasion of Arthur's recall with the\r\nsarcasm: \"Such credentials cannot fail to increase the loyalty of the\r\nhappy Canadians.  O, the blessings of Colonial Dependence!!!\"[7]\r\n\r\nThese excerpts clearly show that there was a considerable body of\r\ncolonial opinion in Van Diemen's Land opposed to the policies of\r\nGovernor Arthur.  The following from the Hobart Town _News_ may be\r\ntaken as fairly typical.  As a matter of fact it is quite moderate in\r\ntone in comparison with some of the other invectives against Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"It was with feelings of the most sincere satisfaction, we announced\r\nin our last number the arrival of the 'good ship' \"Elphinstone\", from\r\nEngland, bringing the very gratifying intelligence of the recall of\r\nColonel George Arthur after an administration of twelve years; during\r\nthe whole of which long period the people have been rendered\r\nwretched, unhappy, discontented and miserable by the misrule of his\r\ngovernment....\"[8]\r\n\r\nOf course, no one would look into the pages of MacKenzie's _Gazette_\r\nto get a favourable impression of Sir George Arthur, but a perusal of\r\nthese excerpts shows that the dissatisfaction against Arthur was\r\nwidespread.  The Launcetown _Advertiser_ states that, \"Throughout the\r\nwhole period of his government the military have been placed in too\r\nprominent a position.  Lieutenants and Ensigns, fresh from the\r\nfrolics of Chatham, have been turned into justices of the peace and\r\nthe whole administration of the colony has been pipe-clayed into a\r\nservice of an amphibious, half-military, half-civil complexion.\"[9]\r\nThe _Colonial Times_ quite frankly lays it down that \"A worse British\r\nGovernor never ruled during the present century.\"[10]  This is strong\r\nlanguage, written in the heat of the moment, but when sufficient\r\ndiscount is made for hot temper the fact remains that Sir George\r\nArthur made a number of enemies in Van Diemen's Land.\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent Arthur was not to blame since he was the victim\r\nof circumstances.  He was forced by the nature of his office to\r\nuphold the abominable system of transportation and his position as\r\ncommander-in-chief of the military forces on the island made him a\r\nmilitary as well as a civil governor of a penal colony.  But on the\r\nother hand, he was by nature an aristocrat with but little democratic\r\nfeeling.  He mistrusted popular government and he had to keep down a\r\ndiscontented population of whom over one-third were convicts.  Sir\r\nWilliam Molesworth in his speech on transportation delivered in the\r\nBritish House of Commons on May 5th, 1840,[11] gives the following\r\nstatistics culled from Sir George Arthur's despatches from Van\r\nDiemen's Land in 1834.  \"Its population in 1834 did not exceed\r\n40,000, of whom 16,000 were convicts, 1,000 soldiers, and 23,000 free\r\ninhabitants; what proportion of the latter had been convicts it is\r\nimpossible to say.  In this small community the summary convictions\r\namounted to about 15,000 in the year in question, amongst which there\r\nwere about 2,000 for felony, 1,200 for misdemeanour, 700 for\r\nassaults, and 3,000 for drunkenness.  Eleven thousand of these\r\nconvictions were of convicts who are summarily punished for all\r\noffences to which the penalty of death is not attached.\"  With such a\r\nturbulent population to control it is no wonder that Sir George\r\nArthur had but little belief in popular government.\r\n\r\nBut however great the opposition to Governor Arthur in Van Diemen's\r\nLand may have been, the Australian Commonwealth to-day owes him one\r\ndebt of gratitude.  According to his biographer Arbuthnot, Arthur was\r\nthe first person to suggest the advisability of a federation of all\r\nthe Australian colonies.  In this he was years in advance of his\r\ntime.  Still it is to be doubted whether any scheme of federation\r\nbrought forward in Arthur's time could have been so complete and\r\nsatisfactory as that consummated in 1901.\r\n\r\nAfter his return to England in March, 1837, Colonel Arthur received\r\nthe Hanoverian Order of Knighthood.  At the close of the same year he\r\nwas appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada and at the same\r\ntime given \"the military rank and command of a major-general on the\r\nstaff.\" Sir George Arthur was now nearly sixty years of age and had\r\nbeen for over twenty-two years a colonial governor.  During that\r\nperiod he had wielded almost despotic power.  It was not at all\r\nlikely that he would be inclined to look with favour upon the demands\r\nof the Upper Canadian Reformers for \"Responsible Government.\"\r\n\r\nOn his arrival in Upper Canada Sir George Arthur was faced by a\r\nsituation of the utmost delicacy.  The rashness and wrong-headedness\r\nof Sir Francis Bond Head and of William Lyon MacKenzie had brought on\r\nthe Upper Canadian Rebellion.  The skirmish at Montgomery's Tavern\r\noccurred on Thursday, December 7th, 1837, and at the close of the day\r\nW. L.  MacKenzie was a fugitive with a price on his head.  The affair\r\nof the \"Caroline\" took place on December 29th.  The destruction of\r\nthis American steamboat resulted in considerable excitement in the\r\nUnited States and relations between the British and American\r\ngovernments became somewhat strained.  The arrest and trial of\r\nAlexander McLeod on the charge of murdering Amos Durfee, an American\r\ncitizen, who was killed during the raid on the \"Caroline\", further\r\ncomplicated the situation.  It was not until 1842 that the incident\r\nwas finally closed by a letter of apology addressed by Sir Robert\r\nPeel to Daniel Webster.\r\n\r\nShortly after the destruction of the \"Caroline\" by the Canadians,\r\nMacKenzie's sympathizers, who had seized Navy Island in the Niagara\r\nRiver near the Falls, were forced to abandon their post, and the\r\ncentre of disturbance shifted westward to the Detroit River.  On this\r\nfrontier an attack was planned by American sympathizers and\r\ndisaffected Canadians against Fort Madden which was situated sixteen\r\nmiles from Windsor, Ontario.  The attempt proved disastrous and\r\nresulted in the capture of \"General\" Theller and other American\r\nsympathizers, who were sent to Toronto for trial.  On the 3rd of\r\nMarch, 1838, Pelee Island in Lake Erie was captured by another band\r\nof invaders who were driven off by a Canadian loyalist force under\r\nColonel Maitland.  This was the last serious attempt made from the\r\nUnited States before the arrival in Upper Canada of Sir George Arthur.\r\n\r\nThe new Lieutenant-Governor then found himself involved in a peculiar\r\ninternational situation.  Were these American sympathizers foreigners\r\nwho were levying open war against the province committed to his\r\ncharge, or were they merely marauders to be classed as pirates?  This\r\nproblem complicated another question of the utmost and pressing\r\nimportance which was, in what way were the leaders of the late\r\nrebellion to be treated?  The Family Compact men and the Tories\r\ngenerally thirsted for their blood.  Two of the leaders of\r\nMacKenzie's rebellion, Lount and Matthews, were already in prison and\r\nwere shortly to be put on trial for their lives.  The problem which\r\nSir George Arthur had to settle was whether or not the extreme\r\npenalty of the law should be exacted.\r\n\r\nIt was not to be expected that the ex-governor of a penal colony\r\nwould show much mercy towards these men who had taken up arms against\r\nconstituted authority.  Nor did he.  Lount and Matthews pleaded\r\nguilty and were on March 29th sentenced to death.  The execution was\r\nto take place on April 12th.  Sir George Arthur had, of course, no\r\npart in sentencing them to death.  That was done by Chief Justice\r\nJohn Beverley Robinson, who, Kingsford tells us, pronounced sentence\r\n\"with that felicity of language ever at his command, but its tone was\r\nmerciless.\"[12]  Sir John Beverley Robinson's son and biographer,\r\nMajor-General C. W. Robinson, quotes from the _Law Journal_ of Upper\r\nCanada for March, 1863, to show that \"of the three individuals\r\nconcerned, the Chief Justice was most certainly the most painfully\r\naffected.\"  But whatever his private feelings may have been the Chief\r\nJustice was unbending in his determination that no mercy be shown.\r\nHe refused to advise the Lieutenant-Governor that Lount and Matthews\r\nbe either pardoned or respited.[13]  In this opinion of the Chief\r\nJustice the Attorney-General, Hagerman, concurred, and although there\r\nwas great excitement in the province and \"petitions signed by not\r\nless than 8,000 persons\"[14] were presented, a reprieve was not\r\ngranted and the two rebel leaders were executed on the day set.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, on April 14th, Arthur penned a long dispatch on the\r\nsubject to Lord Glenelg.  This document shows clearly how completely\r\nthe new Lieutenant-Governor was in sympathy with the Family Compact\r\nand how entirely he failed to understand the point of view of the\r\nReformers.\r\n\r\nThe despatch professes to deal with the cases of Samuel Lount and\r\nPeter Matthews, \"with a general view of the course to be taken with\r\nrespect to persons committed for High Treason.\"  Arthur begins by\r\ncombatting a statement made by Lord Glenelg in a despatch dated\r\nJanuary 6th, 1835, addressed to Sir John Colborne and marked\r\n\"separate,\" to the effect that,\r\n\r\n\"Her Majesty's Government could not fail to notice the wide\r\ndifference which exists between the circumstances which have taken\r\nplace in Lower Canada, and the recent events in Upper Canada.  So far\r\nas can be collected from the information now before me, the chief\r\nmotive which influenced the instigation of the disturbance in Upper\r\nCanada appears to have been the view of plunder, and the offences\r\nwhich they perpetrated, seem to bear comparatively little of a\r\npolitical character.\"\r\n\r\nLord Glenelg's grasp of the situation in Upper Canada may be inferred\r\nfrom the above passage and Sir George Arthur proceeds to enlighten\r\nhim.  Several sentences from his despatch deserve quoting in full,\r\nsince they show how readily Sir George Arthur had embraced the Tory\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\n\"In Upper Canada, the same pretensions to patriotism--the same\r\nassertions of republican Principles--the same accusations against the\r\nGovernment of Tyranny and Corruption--were put forth as the ground\r\nand justification of the Rebellion as in the Lower Province.  In\r\nLower Canada, the right was insisted on, of the popular Branch of the\r\nLegislature sullenly to refuse acting as a legislative Body, and to\r\nbring to a complete stop all beneficial operations of Government, and\r\nto assert a supremacy inconsistent with the relations of a Colony\r\nwith the parent state.\r\n\r\n\"In Upper Canada arms were taken up with the avowed purpose of\r\nassisting the Lower Canadians, and of asserting the same principles\r\nas applicable to this Colony.  In Upper Canada the majority of the\r\nAssembly were attached to British Institutions; but this Majority was\r\nasserted to have been brought about by unconstitutional means on the\r\npart of Government, and the use which the revolutionary Party had\r\nmade of a majority in Parliament when they had it, was precisely the\r\nsame here as in Lower Canada: namely, to coerce the Government by a\r\nrefusal to grant the necessary supplies.  The Revolutionists in\r\nneither province hoped by themselves to overthrow the Government.\r\nThey alike solicited foreign aid, and by its means expected to\r\naccomplish those designs....\"\r\n\r\nIt may easily be seen from the above quotation that Sir George Arthur\r\nmisunderstood the political situation in both Upper and Lower Canada.\r\nHe failed entirely to appreciate the aims of the Reformers and\r\nconsidered them a grave menace to the security of British rule in\r\nCanada.  So imbued was he with the point of view of what he terms the\r\n\"Constitutional Party\" that he believed the rebel leaders, including\r\nLount and Matthews, had proved \"not only that they were determined,\r\nwith their own hands, to execute the foulest deeds in furtherance of\r\ntheir project of subverting the Government; but they had encouraged a\r\nclass of dissolute and vagrant Foreigners to join in their\r\nenterprise, who, they well knew, would not hesitate to inflict upon\r\nthe inhabitants of this Province, if they could have subjugated them,\r\nthe most barbarous atrocities.\"[15]\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances, if the British connexion was to be\r\npreserved and law and order firmly re-established, it was necessary,\r\nArthur considered, that several public examples should be made.\r\nLount and Matthews had pleaded guilty of the heinous crime of\r\nrebellion against authority and were convicted of high treason.  The\r\npenalty was death and it made no difference to Sir George Arthur\r\nwhether eight thousand or thirty thousand[16] persons signed\r\npetitions for their reprieve.  He could not understand that Lount and\r\nMatthews were in the eyes of a very large section of the province\r\nmerely political prisoners who had been unfortunate enough to appeal\r\nto arms and be defeated by their opponents of the Tory party.  The\r\nfact that the Lieutenant-Governor and the Executive Council were\r\nadherents of this Tory party did not, in itself, mean that Lount and\r\nMatthews were traitors.  High treason is a very serious thing and so\r\nis armed rebellion, but the skirmish at Montgomery's Tavern could\r\nhardly be called a battle and there had been great provocation.\r\n\r\nIn refusing to reprieve Lount and Matthews or even to postpone their\r\nexecution until he had had an opportunity to confer with the Colonial\r\nOffice, Sir George Arthur made the chief blunder of his career as\r\nLieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada.  To be sure he acted in complete\r\nharmony with his Executive Council, whose advice he took in the\r\nmatter, but he did not understand the real feeling of the province.\r\nIt is doubtful whether any but the most rabid Tories favoured the\r\nexaction of the death penalty.  The ends of justice could have been\r\nsecured either by transportation or banishment.  Nor did the Colonial\r\nOffice entirely favour the executions of these men.  On May 22nd Lord\r\nGlenelg wrote to Arthur as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I have received your despatch of the 29th March, No. 1, reporting\r\nyour proceedings up to that date, and the measures which you proposed\r\nto adopt with reference to the militia and volunteers, and stating\r\nthat two of the most active of the persons engaged in the late\r\nrevolt, having been brought to trial, had pleaded guilty and been\r\nsentenced to death, and assuring me that the most merciful\r\nconsideration would be shown towards the prisoners generally.\r\n\r\n\"I have laid your despatch before the Queen, and have to convey to\r\nyou Her Majesty's approbation of the proceedings which you have\r\nreported.  Since the receipt, indeed, of your despatch, intelligence\r\nhas appeared in the public papers of the execution at Toronto of\r\nMessrs. Lount and Matthews, the individuals, as I presume, alluded to\r\nin your despatch.\r\n\r\n\"I have every confidence that before consenting to such a means, you\r\ndevoted to the cases of these persons a calm and dispassionate\r\nconsideration, but as I have hitherto received from you no report of\r\nthese executions or of the grounds on which you decided to let the\r\nlaw take its course, I abstain for the present from any further\r\ncomment on them.\r\n\r\n\"I am happy to learn, through the same channel of information, that\r\nno further executions were likely to take place.\"[17]\r\n\r\nEight days later, on May 30th, 1838, after receiving Sir George\r\nArthur's despatch of the 14th of April, Lord Glenelg again alluded to\r\nthe execution and this time one feels that, in his own mild way, the\r\nColonial Secretary is seeking to restrain Arthur:\r\n\r\n\"I have received your despatch of the 14th April last (No. 4),\r\nreporting the executions, on the 12th of that month, of Lount and\r\nMatthews, who had been convicted, on their own confession, of 'high\r\ntreason,' and explaining, at considerable length, the views adopted\r\nby yourself and the Executive Council with regard to these prisoners,\r\nand the considerations which appeared to you imperatively to demand\r\nthat the law in the case should be allowed to take its course.\r\n\r\n\"Her Majesty's Government regret extremely that a paramount necessity\r\nshould have arisen for these examples of severity.  They are,\r\nhowever, fully convinced that you did not consent to the execution of\r\nthese individuals without having given the most ample consideration\r\nto all the circumstances of the case, and they have no reason to\r\ndoubt the necessity of the course which, with the entire concurrence\r\nof the Executive Council, you felt it your duty to adopt.\"[18]\r\n\r\nThe Colonial Secretary did not censure Arthur for his conduct in the\r\nmatter of the execution of Lount and Matthews but he added a\r\nsignificant paragraph regarding the treatment of other political\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\n\"With respect to the disposal of the other prisoners, Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment cannot give you any specific instructions, until they\r\nshall have received the report which you lead me to expect.  But I\r\ncannot defer expressing our earnest hope that, with respect to these\r\npersons, your opinion that no further capital punishments will be\r\nnecessary, may be acted on.  Nothing would cause Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment more sincere regret than an unnecessary recourse to the\r\npunishment of death, and I am persuaded that the same feeling will\r\ninfluence not only yourself, but the Executive Council.  The examples\r\nwhich have been made in the case of the most guilty will be\r\nsufficient to warn others of the consequences to which they render\r\nthemselves liable by such crimes, and this object having been\r\naccomplished, no further advantage could be gained by indict the\r\nextreme penalty of the law on any of their associates.\"[19]\r\n\r\nThe death of Lount and Matthews seems to have satisfied the desire\r\nfor revenge on the part of the extremists and a milder course of\r\npolicy was then pursued by the Lieutenant-Governor and Executive\r\nCouncil.  Several other leaders including \"Generals\" Sutherland and\r\nTheller, both of whom were American citizens, were sentenced to\r\ntransportation.  Theller had been sentenced to death and, according\r\nto his own account, was only saved from the gallows by the energetic\r\nagitation in his favour of the Irish section of the population.  He\r\nhas left a voluminous account of his captivity, including his\r\nsensational escape from the Citadel of Quebec, in his book, _Canada\r\nin 1837-8_, to which the reader is referred if he wishes to obtain a\r\nvery highly-coloured bit of autobiography.[20]\r\n\r\nTheller's case brought up a very interesting question of\r\nInternational Law.  He had been born in Ireland and had become\r\nnaturalized as an American citizen.  When put on trial for his life\r\non a charge of high treason Theller pleaded that his American\r\nnaturalization had rendered him no longer a British subject.  Against\r\nhim a precedent of 1747 was quoted to support the doctrine of\r\n\"perpetual allegiance,\" i.e. \"once a British subject, always a\r\nBritish subject.\"  The jury brought in the curious verdict that \"if\r\nthe prisoner was a British subject he was guilty of treason.\"  Chief\r\nJustice Robinson, acting in accordance with his belief in the\r\ndoctrine of 'perpetual allegiance' ruled that Theller was still a\r\nBritish subject and thereupon sentenced him to death.  Under the\r\ncircumstances to carry out the death sentence would have been very\r\ninadvisable.  Pressure was brought to bear upon the\r\nLieutenant-Governor and the Executive Council, and as a result a\r\nrespite was granted \"until Her Majesty's pleasure should be\r\nknown.\"[21] Theller was soon after removed from Toronto to Quebec and\r\ndetained there in the Citadel, from which he escaped.  Sutherland was\r\ntried by court martial, imprisoned in Toronto and Quebec, and finally\r\nreturned to American soil.\r\n\r\nThese American prisoners were very embarrassing to the Upper Canadian\r\nauthorities.  There was still considerable excitement along the\r\nAmerican frontier and the danger of invasion was by no means over.\r\nLount and Matthews were considered martyrs by many on the American\r\nside of the border.  Highly coloured accounts of the execution\r\nappeared in the American press.  Even the New York Sun took up the\r\nmatter and recounted how Mrs. Lount on the day previous to her\r\nhusband's execution \"pleaded with Governor Arthur for hours for his\r\nlife, and when she pointed to _thirty thousand names_ who petitioned\r\nwith her for the exercise of the royal prerogative, he coldly replied\r\n'that he had not believed that Mr. Lount had so many friends in the\r\nprovince, and that there was the more necessity that he should be\r\nmade an example to the rest.'\"[22]  Under these circumstances the\r\nexecution of Theller would have added oil to the flame.\r\n\r\nThe Congress of the United States passed a \"Neutrality Bill\" which\r\ncleared up the situation a great deal by denying official sanction to\r\nany schemes of invasion and enjoining neutrality on all American\r\ncitizens.  The state authorities along the frontier also tried to\r\nprevent any movement of armed forces against Canada.  Theller records\r\nhow he successfully dodged the American authorities in making his\r\nattack on Fort Madden and how Governor Mason of Michigan was coming\r\ndown the river with a strong force when Theller and his friends\r\napproached the island of Bois Blanc which lies in Canadian waters.\r\nNo doubt there often was a certain amount of laxity on the part of\r\nthe American authorities, and Sir George Arthur finds occasion to\r\ncondemn it at times, but the United States Government seems on the\r\nwhole to have acted very wisely.  The burning of the \"Caroline,\"\r\nwhich it should be remembered was an American vessel attacked by a\r\nCanadian force in American waters, might easily have led to very\r\nserious consequences.  If President Van Buren and his cabinet had\r\nwanted war it would have been quite possible to claim the destruction\r\nof the ill-fated \"Caroline\" as an overt act of hostility.\r\nFortunately milder counsels prevailed and war was avoided.  But this\r\nincident profoundly affected and prolonged the agitation on the\r\nAmerican side of the border.\r\n\r\nOn April 23rd, 1838, an \"authorized agent\" of the United States\r\nGovernment, Mr. Aaron Vail, who had recently been Chargé d'Affaires\r\nin the American Embassy in London, arrived at Toronto.  Mr. Vail,\r\naccording to the official despatch of the British ambassador at\r\nWashington, Mr. H. S. Fox, was charged with the task \"of inquiring\r\ninto, and reporting upon, the actual condition of various\r\nindividuals, who are now in confinement in Canada.\"  Mr. Fox\r\nconsidered Mr. Vail a very fitting envoy and that his mission would\r\nbe beneficial \"by dissipating false rumours which tend to keep alive\r\nfeelings of ill-will between the British and American inhabitants on\r\nthe Canadian frontier.\"\r\n\r\nAaron Vail's mission seems to have fulfilled expectations, for on\r\nApril 25th Arthur wrote to Fox that it was quite impossible that a\r\nmore proper person than Mr. Vail could have been selected by the\r\nPresident, and that he trusted all the benefit would result from his\r\nmission as Fox had anticipated.  Vail does not seem to have formed a\r\nvery high opinion of the American prisoners, whom he described as\r\n\"the 'scum' of the population.\"[23]  Theller has left us an amusing\r\naccount of how the Toronto gaol was carefully scrubbed in honour of\r\nVail's visit and how the prison authorities hinted that \"the\r\nAmericans had better clean and dress up, as they might expect to see\r\nsome visitors, and probably hear some good news.\"[24]  The prisoners\r\npoured out their tale of woe to Vail who \"took notes and assured us\r\nthat the government of the United States would strictly inquire into\r\nthe matter.\"[25]  Nothing much, however, seems to have resulted from\r\nthe inquiry, since it was evident that Vail's mission was to smooth\r\nover affairs rather than to stir up further strife by issuing an\r\ninflammatory report on Canadian conditions.\r\n\r\nSoon after the departure of Mr. Vail occurred the trial and\r\nconviction of Charles Durand.  Durand's case was peculiar, and\r\nnoteworthy as illustrating the methods employed by Arthur and his\r\nExecutive Council to stamp out disaffection.  Durand was put on trial\r\nfor high treason, the chief evidence against him being a letter which\r\nwas found in his house among his papers addressed to W. L. MacKenzie,\r\nand which contained within it charges against the Executive Council\r\nand Family Compact generally.  This letter was never sent and\r\nMacKenzie in his _Gazette_ denies ever having seen it.  It was,\r\ntherefore, a high handed proceeding to sentence a man to death on the\r\nevidence of a private paper which was never published.  Durand was\r\nafterwards respited and banished to the United States, but his trial\r\nand conviction on the 7th of May did not tend to increase the\r\npopularity of the Lieutenant-Governor and his Executive Council.\r\n\r\nDurand's letter certainly was written in no mild tone and it still\r\nbreathes forth the spirit of disaffection.  But it was never\r\npublished and as such should not have been used to convict its\r\nauthor.  The following-sentences will serve as a sample of the whole:\r\n\r\n\"The principles of the reformers are those of truth, are those that\r\ntend to promote the happiness of the many--instead of the few.\r\nAlthough in common with thousands of the old farmers in Canada, with\r\nthousands of the sons of U. E. Loyalists, I was willing to petition\r\nthe mother country for the redress of our political wrongs, and even\r\nto petition them again and again, yet when I see insult upon insult\r\nheaped upon the reformers of this Province: our Governors allowed\r\nwith impunity to slander and laugh at the people and their House of\r\nAssembly--when I see Governors who have held up with both hands the\r\ngracious despatches of the deceitful and tyrannical Colonial\r\nOffice--conspiring against the liberties of this colony by\r\nestablishing a 'Dominant Church' and 'English Church Rectories'\r\namongst us against our will and desire, _raised, promoted_ and\r\n_applauded_ for deceiving the people here, when I see Judges\r\nsuspended and dismissed from their offices for voting for liberal men\r\nand the _elective franchise_, the only spark of liberty we can boast\r\nof, trampled down by office holders, and done away with by the\r\nGovernor issuing thousands of patent deeds to his favorites and\r\nofficials, I begin to ask myself, shall I, shall we, who have made\r\nthe country what it is, be used thus with impunity?  Shall we, the\r\nnative Canadians, the sons of U. E. Loyalists, be called aliens in\r\nthe land of our birth, and by the fluttering officials that hang on\r\nthe smiles of a Governor's brow--I say nay.  I feel that we are too\r\ntame--that we have forgotten that we are free--that we are in\r\nAmerica,\"[26] etc. etc.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to quote more of this verbiage.  The above is\r\nsufficient to show that Durand was able to \"tear a passion to\r\ntatters, to very rags,\" and if he had ever had this letter published\r\nit would have doubtless \"split the ears of the groundlings.\"  The\r\ncurious thing it that a man should be condemned to death for writing\r\nsuch a letter.  Truly Arthur and his Executive Council lacked a sense\r\nof humour!\r\n\r\nAbout this time a new movement against Canada was on foot in the\r\nUnited States.  \"Hunters' Lodges\" were formed with the object \"never\r\nto rest, till all tyrants of Britain cease to have any dominion or\r\nfooting whatever in North America.\"[27]  This new organization seems\r\nto have originated in May, 1838, and to have spread rapidly,\r\nespecially through the states bordering on Upper Canada.  Lindsay\r\ntells us that at a convention of the Hunters' Lodges of Ohio and\r\nMichigan held at Cleveland from September 16th to 22nd[28] of that\r\nyear, seventy delegates were present.  At this meeting a republican\r\ngovernment was appointed for Upper Canada, including a president and\r\ncomplete cabinet.  A \"republican bank of Upper Canada\" was projected\r\nwhich was to issue a paper currency adorned with the heads of Lount,\r\nMatthews and Moreau who took part in the Short Hills affair in June,\r\n1838, to which reference will shortly be made.  But the members of\r\nthe \"Hunters' Lodges\" though full of enthusiasm were short of funds,\r\nso the bank did not prosper.\r\n\r\nBefore this grandiloquent meeting at Cleveland there had been several\r\ndisturbances along the border.  The first of these was the\r\ndestruction on May 30th, of the Canadian passenger steamer \"Sir\r\nRobert Peel\" at Wells' Island by American sympathizers.  Wells'\r\nIsland, one of the Thousand Islands, is situated in American waters\r\nand so the authorities of New York state were to a certain extent\r\nnegligent in allowing the incident to occur.  The destruction of the\r\n\"Sir Robert Peel\" seems to have been regarded by the \"patriots\" who\r\nboarded her as an act of revenge for the burning of the \"Caroline.\"\r\nBut whatever the motives of those concerned the incident caused bad\r\nfeeling along the border.  An American steamer, the \"Telegraph,\" was\r\nfired upon on June 2nd by the Canadian sentries at Brockville, the\r\nexcuse given that the \"Telegraph\" had not answered when hailed by the\r\nsentries.  An investigation was held at which the authorities of St.\r\nLawrence County, N.Y., were present, and it was ascertained that the\r\nsentries had acted without orders.\r\n\r\nA few days after these incidents a body of \"patriots\" under the\r\nleadership of James Moreau crossed the Niagara frontier in order to\r\nfree Upper Canada.  Moreau, who is called Morrow in the Canadian\r\nrecords, issued a proclamation which called upon the Canadians to\r\ncome to his assistance and proclaimed that this was the hour of their\r\nredemption.  The answer of the \"oppressed Canadians\" was the\r\nengagement fought at the Short Hills on June 21st when the \"patriots\"\r\nwere defeated by the Canadian militia.  Moreau fled with a price on\r\nhis head but was captured, tried and condemned to death.  The\r\nExecutive Council on July 26th refused to reprieve him since he was\r\nconsidered a proper case for capital punishment under an Act of the\r\nParliament of Upper Canada passed the previous session in order \"to\r\nprotect the Inhabitants of this Province against lawless aggressions\r\nfrom Subjects of Foreign Countries at Peace with Her Majesty.\"\r\nMoreau was accordingly executed at Niagara on July 30th.  If Sir\r\nGeorge Arthur had had his way there would have been more executions,\r\nbut Lord Durham intervened.\r\n\r\nThe next serious outbreak on the frontier was the attack of von\r\nSchoultz near Prescott on November 11th.  The invaders seized a point\r\nof land on which a stone windmill had been built and fortified the\r\nplace.  An engagement ensued and the invaders were driven back to\r\nshelter within the windmill.  On the 14th of November British\r\nreinforcements, including artillery, arrived, and two days later an\r\nattack was made at the distance of only 400 yards.  The garrison of\r\nthe windmill then surrendered and nearly 160 prisoners were\r\ntaken.[29]  Von Schoultz and nine others were executed in Kingston.\r\nVon Schoultz was defended by Sir John A. Macdonald, then a young\r\nbarrister just beginning his profession, but there was little that\r\ncould be said in his defence.\r\n\r\nThe last movement against Upper Canada took place on December 4th,\r\nwhen an attack was made on Windsor.  This affair is thus described in\r\nthe District General Orders of December 10th, dated at Toronto:[30]\r\n\r\n\"A large body of pirates and brigands, belonging to the hostile\r\ncombination in the neighbouring country which has of late so much\r\ndisturbed the peace of this province, after assembling in the\r\nneighbourhood of Detroit, and showing themselves at different points\r\nin the vicinity, at length had the hardihood to effect a landing near\r\nWindsor, about three miles from Sandwich, on the morning of the 4th\r\ninstant, where they commenced their work of destruction by burning a\r\nsteam-boat called the \"Thames,\" and a house used as a barrack, making\r\nprisoners a small but gallant party of militia quartered therein,\r\nwho, in defending themselves against the attacking banditti shot\r\ntheir leader and eventually effected their escape.\"\r\n\r\nAt Sandwich, Colonel Prince gathered a force of local militia, made\r\n\"a spirited attack\" and put the invaders to flight.  Four prisoners\r\nwho had been taken were shot by orders of Colonel Prince, whose\r\naction was afterward severely censured by Lord Brougham and others.\r\nAfter the action at Sandwich the rest of the invaders either\r\nrecrossed to American territory or else took to the woods, where many\r\nperished from the cold.  So ended the last attempt at invasion of\r\nUpper Canada.  Seven of those captured at Windsor were executed at\r\nLondon, including Daniel Davis Bedford and Albert Clark.  The cases\r\nof these two men were discussed at two separate meetings of the\r\nExecutive Council and it was decided that each of them should suffer\r\nthe death penalty.  In these decisions Sir George Arthur entirely\r\nconcurred.  The ex-governor of the penal colony was still exacting\r\nvengeance.  In his defence it should be stated that the loyal section\r\nof the province, including the Executive Council, considered these\r\nmen filibusters and murderers.\r\n\r\nThe treatment meted out by the Executive Council to those British\r\nsubjects, American citizens and others who were taken in arms against\r\nthe government of Upper Canada has been discussed at some length.\r\nThis has been done for two reasons, first that it bulks so large in\r\nSir George Arthur's official despatches, and second because it shows\r\nwhat complete harmony existed between Sir George and his Executive\r\nCouncil.  Not even Sir Francis Head was more devoted to the Family\r\nCompact party.  Sir George Arthur was by temperament and training\r\nentirely on the side of established authority and opposed to\r\ndisaffection in all its forms.  A strong conservative, he mistrusted\r\nthe rule of the people and, therefore, opposed as stubbornly as\r\npossible the popular demand for Responsible Government.  In this, as\r\nin other respects, Arthur found himself completely at variance with\r\nthe Governor-General, the Earl of Durham.\r\n\r\nIt was unfortunate for Arthur that he was in Upper Canada during a\r\nperiod of unrest and transition.  It was even more unfortunate for\r\nhim that he was brought into contact with Lord Durham.  Durham was a\r\nman of vision who sketched out a mighty scheme which took years to\r\nput into actual practice.  Arthur was a man of routine who could not\r\nappreciate either Durham or his visions.  Above all he mistrusted\r\nthat pet project of Lord Durham, Responsible Government, and did not\r\nhesitate to say so.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of the Earl of Durham as Governor-General of the\r\nBritish North American provinces was deeply resented by Sir George\r\nArthur.  By virtue of his commission Durham was empowered to assume\r\nthe government of the province in which he might be and to retain it\r\nduring his residence in that province.  During that period the\r\nfunctions of the Lieutenant-Governor were to be altogether\r\nsuspended.[31]  Due notice of this fact was sent each of the\r\nLieutenant-Governors of the British North American provinces\r\nincluding, of course, Sir George Arthur.  After receiving this notice\r\nSir George wrote on June 5th, 1838, to Lord Glenelg, complaining of\r\nthis arrangement.  He based his case against it on his experience in\r\nVan Diemen's Land, which was during his tenure of office there a\r\ndependency of New South Wales, and called to Lord Glenelg remembrance\r\na conversation he had had with him on the subject.  In fact, as\r\nArthur reminds Glenelg, the terms on which he consented to become\r\nLieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada were that no change of that sort\r\nwould be made.\r\n\r\nThree days after writing thus to Lord Glenelg Sir George Arthur\r\nreceived a circular letter from Lord Durham requesting him \"to enter\r\ninto the most free and confidential communication ... on all subjects\r\naffecting the province of Upper Canada, both as regards its internal\r\ncondition and the state of affairs on the frontiers.\"[32]  Lord\r\nDurham included in this letter the following paragraphs in order to\r\nallay the suspicion that might exist in Arthur's mind that he wished\r\nto diminish the Lieutenant-Governor's authority,\r\n\r\n\"Your Excellency will of course understand that this request does not\r\ncontemplate any interference with your administration of the\r\ngovernment, but refers to the necessity which exists that I, as\r\nGovernor-General of all the North American provinces, should be\r\nimmediately informed of all matters of general interest affecting the\r\nhigh and important mission which has been conferred upon me.\r\n\r\n\"It will be my duty as well as my inclination to uphold your\r\nauthority, not only from the respect which I must entertain for you\r\npersonally, but from a due regard to the efficiency of the public\r\nservice.\"\r\n\r\nThis circular must have mollified Arthur somewhat, or else he was too\r\nwell trained a public servant to show his innermost feelings.  At any\r\nrate he writes to Durham on June 9th as follows,\r\n\r\n\"I sincerely thank your Lordship for your very kind declaration of\r\nconfidence in me and for the determination which your Lordship has\r\nexpressed of upholding my authority.\r\n\r\n\"It is peculiarly gratifying to me to receive these assurances from\r\nyour Lordship, for I ought in candour to say that from the time I\r\nreceived Lord Glenelg's 'Circular,' I have been very apprehensive of\r\nthe embarrassment which might arise out of the new relative position\r\nin which I found myself most unexpectedly placed.  The immeasurable\r\ndistinction between your Lordship's station and my own must satisfy\r\nyour Lordship that this has proceeded from no vain jealousy, on\r\npersonal grounds, of the control of a superior.  With diminished\r\ninfluence I feared the ability of being useful to Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment and to this province would be taken away; for I have to\r\nco-operate with a legislature which must have a reasonable degree of\r\nconfidence of my powers to act in union with them, and to fulfil my\r\nprofessions.[33]\"\r\n\r\nTo this rather naïve letter Durham on June 18th replied stating even\r\nmore clearly that no act of his would diminish Arthur's influence and\r\nauthority in Upper Canada.  He goes on to put his case as follows,\r\n\r\n\"I repeat to you, that I have no wish to interfere with the local\r\nadministration of the affairs of any of the provinces included in my\r\ngeneral government.\r\n\r\n\"Those functions will be vested, as before, in the\r\nLieutenant-Governors; but it is essential to the success of my\r\nmission and to the due execution of my duties, more especially in the\r\npresent disturbed state of our relations with the frontier population\r\nof the United States, that I should be promptly and directly made\r\nacquainted with all events bearing on those important questions.\"\r\n\r\nArthur seems to have followed out Durham's instructions as regards\r\nfrontier troubles to the letter, since we find the following\r\npostscript added to his despatch of June 22nd, 1838 (No. 4):\r\n\r\n\"_P.S._ I make now no communications myself to the American\r\nGovernment, and have troubled your Lordship with all these\r\nparticulars, as a representation will of course come with far greater\r\nforce from your Lordship.\"[34]\r\n\r\nIn July, 1838, Lord Durham made a flying visit to Upper Canada.  His\r\nobject seems to have been to ascertain for himself existing\r\nconditions in this province and to form his own opinion as to what\r\npolicy it would be best to pursue.  He writes thus to Lord Glenelg\r\nfrom Montreal on July 6th:\r\n\r\n\"Lower Canada is perfectly free from internal troubles, and her\r\nfrontier is not menaced by the Americans; but Upper Canada, by the\r\nlast accounts from Sir George Arthur, is in a very unsatisfactory\r\nstate, both as to domestic dissensions and border incursions.  I am\r\nanxious, therefore, to proceed there as soon as possible.\"[35]\r\n\r\nLord Durham left Montreal on July 10th, arrived in Kingston late on\r\nthe night of the 11th, and then proceeded to Niagara.  At Niagara Sir\r\nGeorge Arthur met him.  From Niagara Lord Durham journeyed to Toronto\r\nwhere Sir George was also present to receive him formally, along with\r\nthe mayor and corporation and the citizens of the provincial capital.\r\nOn the 19th of July Durham returned to Kingston and thence down the\r\nSt.  Lawrence to Montreal where he arrived on July 24th.  His visit\r\nto Upper Canada had been short but he had covered a great deal of\r\nterritory and seems to have been pleased with what he saw.\r\n\r\nIf one of Lord Durham's objects in making his hurried trip to Upper\r\nCanada was to obtain a better understanding with Sir George Arthur he\r\nmust have been disappointed since shortly after his return to Lower\r\nCanada their relations became somewhat strained.  The reason for this\r\nwas the action of Sir George Arthur and his Executive Council in\r\nsentencing to death Samuel Chandler and Benjamin Waite for their part\r\nin the Short Hills affair.  The families of these men had appealed to\r\nDurham \"for an extension of the Royal mercy\" and \"for the grant to\r\nthem of Her Majesty's pardon.\"[36]  Durham asked Arthur for\r\nparticulars, reminding him that Lord Glenelg had written on the 3rd\r\nof April asking that \"the utmost lenity, compatible with public\r\nsafety, should be exercised towards the insurgents.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Sir George Arthur replied on August 20th, complaining that\r\nDurham's action was \"depriving the officer administering the\r\nGovernment of Upper Canada of the powers expressly vested in him by\r\nthe Royal Commission.\"[37]  Arthur also claimed that Durham \"had\r\nmisapprehended the intention of the instruction of the Secretary of\r\nState\" and Lord Glenelg had in a despatch of July 12th referred him\r\n\"to the power of pardoning for treason vested in the officers\r\nadministering this government under your Lordship's commission as\r\nGovernor-in-Chief.\"\r\n\r\nDurham in his turn maintained that all he wished was to exercise the\r\nsuperintending authority he possessed as Governor-General.  He\r\nadmitted that Arthur had the power of pardoning for treason delegated\r\nto him, but would argue that that power was exempt from \"the general\r\nsubordination to instructions from the Governor-General.\"[38]  Durham\r\nthen proceeds to give his opinion of Sir George Arthur's policy in\r\nthe following terms.\r\n\r\n\"Your Excellency's explanation of the policy which you had determined\r\non adopting with regard to the prisoners convicted at Niagara does\r\nnot immediately strike me as indicating a course so obviously correct\r\nthat I can dispense with the information which I required in my\r\ndespatch of the 16th instant.  I cannot quite admit the propriety of\r\nselecting some one subject of Her Majesty to share the fate of\r\nMorreau, the leader of the expedition, who happened to be a citizen\r\nof the United States.  The fate of Her Majesty's subjects should be\r\ndetermined on a view of their own conduct, and of the circumstances\r\nwhich have led the juries to accompany their verdict of guilty, in\r\nevery case, with a recommendation to mercy.\"\r\n\r\nA further despatch of Lord Durham to Arthur on September 18th went\r\ninto the case of Jacob Beamer in some detail.  Beamer had been\r\nsingled out by the Executive Council as the scape goat and was alone\r\nto suffer the death penalty.  To this Durham would not agree but\r\nrequested that the case be referred to Lord Glenelg.  This despatch\r\nis interesting since it shows that the Executive Council of Upper\r\nCanada was at this time none too friendly towards Lord Durham and was\r\nquite willing to stir up strife between the Governor-General and the\r\nLieutenant-Governor.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the correspondence between Arthur and Durham had\r\ncontinued at some length and not always with the best of feeling.\r\nBut no actual breach seems to have occurred and at length the vexed\r\nproblem of the political prisoners seemed likely of solution.  A\r\ngeneral amnesty was to be proclaimed for all except a certain few who\r\nwere to be named in the proclamation.  But by this time Lord Durham\r\nwas preparing to return to England.\r\n\r\nAmong the despatches sent by Sir George Arthur to the Earl of Durham\r\nis one dated July 9th, 1838, which deals with the political condition\r\nof Upper Canada.  This letter establishes without a doubt the close\r\nadherence of Sir George Arthur to the Family Compact party, all the\r\nmore so because Sir George tries to claim his independence of all\r\nparty affiliations.  It also shows that the Lieutenant-Governor had\r\nreceived instructions from the Home Government \"to pursue the policy\r\nand measures of Sir Francis Head.\"  This Arthur apparently had\r\nattempted to do in so far as his support of the dominant party in the\r\nprovince was concerned.  He had fallen in completely with their way\r\nof thinking and had failed to distinguish between reformers and\r\nrebels.  He even warned Lord Sydenham that Dr. Egerton Ryerson was \"a\r\ndangerous man\" chiefly because Ryerson supported Mr. Bidwell, who had\r\nbeen Speaker of the Legislative Assembly and had been forced to leave\r\nthe province on account of persecution by Sir Francis Head and his\r\nExecutive Council after MacKenzie's Rebellion.  In this letter of\r\nJuly 9th Sir George Arthur attempts to combat the opinions of Mr.\r\nIsaac Buchanan, a reformer, who had been presenting his views on the\r\nUpper Canadian political situation to Lord Durham.  According to\r\nArthur, Mr. Buchanan was endeavouring to prejudice Durham's mind\r\n\"against some of the most respectable and most highly esteemed men in\r\nthe province,\" and the Lieutenant-Governor hastened to defend his\r\nfriends.  One or two sentences from this despatch deserve quotation\r\nas showing Arthur's attitude towards the self-constituted aristocracy\r\nof Upper Canada.\r\n\r\n\"In this Colony, as in other countries, respectable station, united\r\nwith superior talents and good conduct, gives a certain degree of\r\ninfluence which is natural and salutary, and it would be of all\r\nthings ungracious and discouraging, as well as impolitic, if the\r\nGovernment were to manifest a jealousy of an influence so honorably\r\nacquired.  It is, so far as I have been able to judge, most\r\nunobtrusively exercised and I am satisfied, from what I have\r\nexperienced, that so far as he can conscientiously do so, your\r\nLordship will have the most cordial co-operation of the Chief Justice\r\nand of all the Family Compact, in all its ramifications throughout\r\nthe Province.\"[39]\r\n\r\nIn this same despatch Arthur informs Durham that he had \"amicably\r\ndiscussed with the Leaders of each Denomination, the long contested\r\nClergy Reserves Question,\" and had the intention of \"bringing in a\r\nBill to reinvest those lands in the Crown\" if better means could not\r\nbe found of providing a settlement.  He also thought that he would be\r\nable to carry any measure he desired successfully through the\r\nProvincial Parliament.  It should be remembered that the ultra-tory\r\nassembly of 1836, at whose elections Sir Francis Head so\r\ndistinguished himself, was still in existence and that Sir George\r\nArthur thought that it would pass any measure brought forward by the\r\ngovernment.  Already on a previous occasion Sir George had written to\r\nthe Governor-General on the same subject of the Clergy Reserves and\r\nhad expressed a hope that asperities had been already softened and\r\nthat at the next meeting of the Legislature he would be able to see\r\nthis long-pending contest terminated upon nearly the same principle\r\nas it had been settled in Van Diemen's Land during his administration\r\nthere.  But in this pious hope Arthur reckoned without the opposition\r\nof the Reformers.\r\n\r\nThe aim of Sir George Arthur and the Executive Council was \"to secure\r\nthe removal of the Clergy Reserves question from the hostile arena of\r\nthe Upper Canada Legislature to the friendly atmosphere of the\r\nEnglish House of Commons, and the still more friendly tribunal of the\r\nHouse of Lords--where the bench of bishops would be sure to defend\r\nthe claims of the Church to their royal patrimony.\"[40]  This project\r\nthe Reformers and opponents of the Clergy Reserves were determined to\r\nresist to the uttermost.  A long controversy raged during 1838 and\r\n1839.  In December, 1837, a bill had been brought forward to reinvest\r\nthe Reserves in the Crown, but a despatch from the Home Government\r\nwhich arrived soon after showed that the British Parliamentary\r\nauthorities had no desire to interfere in the settlement of this\r\nvexed question.  During 1838 Sir George Arthur still hoped that the\r\nscheme for reinvesting the Clergy Reserves in the Crown would carry\r\nas the references in his despatches, cited above, show.  Such a bill\r\nwould have suited the members of the Executive Council and Family\r\nCompact generally.  It would have meant that the Church of England\r\nwould have still profited at the expense of the other denominations.\r\nAs it was, in 1837 out of a total of £10,852 11s 8d the Church of\r\nEngland received £7,291 5s Od, the Church of Scotland £1,425, the\r\nUnited Synod of Upper Canada £636 6s 8d, and the Roman Catholic\r\nclergy £1,000.[41]  The Wesleyan Methodists and other denominations\r\ndid not receive one penny from the \"one-seventh of all Crown lands\r\nset aside for the support of a Protestant clergy.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the reassembling of the Upper Canadian Legislature in February,\r\n1839, Sir George Arthur stated that \"the settlement of this vitally\r\nimportant question ought not to be longer delayed\" and hoped that the\r\ncontending parties could be amicably adjusted, but added meaningly\r\nthat if all their efforts failed it would only remain to reinvest the\r\nReserves in the hands of the Crown.  Various bills on the subject\r\nwere introduced and finally the Legislative Council amended one sent\r\nto it by the Assembly in such a way as to put complete control of the\r\nClergy Reserves in the hands of the Imperial Parliament.  This bill\r\nas amended was passed in the Assembly in a thin house by a majority\r\nof one.  Sir George Arthur and his party had triumphed by a narrow\r\nmargin.  But the royal assent was never given to the bill owing to an\r\nobjection raised in England that the Upper Canadian Legislature,\r\nbeing a subordinate authority, could not make such a delegation to\r\nthe Imperial Parliament.\r\n\r\nA compromise bill which was devised to meet the approval of the\r\nmajority of people in Upper Canada was submitted to the House of\r\nAssembly in January, 1840, but it was the work not of Sir George\r\nArthur, but of Lord Durham's successor, Mr. Poulett Thomson (Lord\r\nSydenham).  It provided that the remainder of the land should be sold\r\nand that the annual proceeds of the fund, when realized, be\r\ndistributed one half to the Church of England and the Presbyterians\r\nand one half to the other denominations who wished to share it.  This\r\nbill was passed in Upper Canada and sent to England where it met its\r\ndeath blow in the House of Lords.  The vexatious Clergy Reserves\r\nproblem still remained unsettled.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of the Clergy Reserves, Sir George Arthur had shown\r\nhimself the uncompromising ally of the Family Compact.  He was to\r\nshow it once more in his attitude towards the reunion of the\r\nprovinces and the introduction of Responsible Government.\r\n\r\nThe reunion of the provinces was urged by Lord Durham in his Report\r\nand was favoured by a large majority of the inhabitants of Upper\r\nCanada.  It was opposed by the Family Compact, supported as usual by\r\nSir George Arthur.  But the feeling for union was so strong that on\r\nMarch 23rd, 1839, three resolutions in favour of the reunion of the\r\nprovinces were carried by the Upper Canadian Legislature.  Four days\r\nlater, on March 27th, fourteen qualifying resolutions were passed by\r\nthe Assembly.  These resolutions, if embodied in the Act of Union,\r\nwould have placed the balance of power in the hands of the British\r\npopulation of the united province.\r\n\r\nA committee of the Legislative Council was appointed at the same time\r\nto inquire into Lord Durham's Report and to put forward their side of\r\nthe case.  This was very ably done in a document dated May 11th,\r\n1839, and approved by the Legislative Council.  In this report on the\r\nReport Lord Durham's \"great panacea for all political disorders\r\n'Responsible Government'\"[42] was attacked and certain inaccurate\r\nstatements were challenged.  The blame for the recent troubles in\r\nUpper Canada was cast entirely upon the Reformers and the question\r\npropounded: \"Is it because reformers, or a portion of them, can\r\ncommand the sympathies of the United States, and of Lower Canadian\r\nrebels, that the internal affairs of a British colony must be\r\nconducted so as to please them?\"\r\n\r\nWith these sentiments Sir George Arthur heartily concurred.  He was\r\nentirely opposed to \"Responsible Government\" and still feared\r\ndisaffection in the provinces.  During the early months of 1839 the\r\ntrials of the political prisoners had continued and had attracted\r\nmuch attention on both sides of the border.  There was still\r\nconsiderable excitement in the province and riots occurred in some\r\nplaces.  In one of these which took place at Stone's Tavern, Percy\r\nTownship, Northumberland County, on June 5th, 1839, the reformers\r\ncarried \"a red flag on which were written or printed the words, 'Lord\r\nDurham and Reform.'\"[43]  Incidents such as this increased Sir George\r\nArthur's mistrust of Lord Durham's schemes for the better government\r\nof Canada, and on July 2nd we find him writing to the Marquis of\r\nNormanby, Lord Glenelg's successor, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I have all along informed Her Majesty's Government that it is absurd\r\nto think of Upper Canada as containing a whole community of\r\nloyalists.  There is a considerable section of persons who are\r\ndisloyal to the core; reform is on their lips, but separation is in\r\ntheir hearts.  These men having, for the last two or three years,\r\nmade a 'responsible government' their watchword, are now\r\nextravagantly elated because the Earl of Durham has recommended that\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\n\"They regard it as an unerring means to get rid of all British\r\nconnexion, while the Earl of Durham, on the contrary, has recommended\r\nit as a measure for cementing the existing bond of union with the\r\nmother country.\"\r\n\r\nThese few sentences throw great light on Sir George Arthur's attitude\r\non the question of 'Responsible Government.'  As usual, the Reformers\r\nare annexationists.  It was the usual tactics of the dominant party\r\nto call them so and to include as disloyal all those who favoured the\r\ncause of Reform.  Of course Sir George Arthur, from the nature of his\r\nposition, was supposed to be moderate in his political views, but he\r\ndoes yeoman service for the Family Compact in trying to impress upon\r\nthe authorities in England that the Reformers were disloyal.  It is\r\nimpossible to state what percentage of the Reformers were actually\r\ndisloyal, but it must be remembered, as Egerton Ryerson has told us,\r\nthe great body of the Reformers took no part in MacKenzie's Rebellion\r\nexcept to suppress it.  The bulk of moderate opinion in the province\r\nsided neither with the annexationists nor with the Family Compact,\r\nbut readily embraced the suggestions set forth in Lord Durham's\r\nReport.  With these moderate reformers Sir George Arthur was soon at\r\nvariance.\r\n\r\nIn the month of August, 1839, Sir George received a series of\r\nresolutions supporting Lord Durham's Report and Responsible\r\nGovernment passed at a meeting of freeholders and inhabitants of the\r\nGore District held on July 27th.  This meeting resolved that the\r\nHouse of Assembly did not represent the wishes or sentiments of the\r\nprovince \"particularly in its late Report of its committee,\r\npurporting to be the Report of the House of Assembly in answer to\r\nLord Durham's Report on the State of the Province.\"  It also resolved\r\n\"that the Report of the Earl of Durham, in all its material points,\r\nhas been received by an overwhelming majority of the people of Upper\r\nCanada with the most abundant gratification\" and \"that this meeting\r\nis of opinion that a responsible government, as recommended in Lord\r\nDurham's Report, is the only means of restoring confidence, allaying\r\ndiscontent, or perpetuating the connexion between Great Britain and\r\nthis colony.\"[44]\r\n\r\nAll this was wormwood and gall to Sir George Arthur, who hastened to\r\nreply to this address.  In his answer he attacks Responsible\r\nGovernment and states \"that the proposed plan would lead to a state\r\nof things inconsistent with the relations of this colony, as a\r\ndependency of the British Crown.\"  This was a bold statement for the\r\nLieutenant-Governor to make and it was soon to land him into\r\ndifficulties since the British authorities were prepared to carry out\r\nLord Durham's schemes.  Mr. Poulett Thomson was selected as\r\nGovernor-General and under him Sir George Arthur was once more to act\r\nas a subordinate Lieutenant-Governor.[45]\r\n\r\nIt was a curious arrangement, since Arthur was known to be opposed to\r\nthe very scheme of government which Poulett Thomson was being sent\r\nout to initiate.  But Sir George Arthur was not unwilling to\r\nco-operate with the new Governor-General.  He met Poulett Thomson at\r\nMontreal on October 25th and conferred with him on the subject of\r\nUpper Canada.  It was decided that the Legislature of that province\r\nshould be summoned for December 3rd and that Poulett Thomson would\r\nvisit Upper Canada about the 18th of November.  The Governor-General\r\nwas determined to open the session of the Legislature in person.\r\nThis determination on his part was largely the outcome of his\r\nconversations with Sir George Arthur, who strongly urged upon him the\r\ndesirability of so doing.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this meeting between the Governor-General and\r\nLieutenant-Governor, Poulett Thomson was present to open the\r\nLegislature on December 3rd.  After that date Sir George Arthur's\r\npower in Upper Canada became entirely secondary to that of Poulett\r\nThomson.  He still acted as Lieutenant-Governor in the absence of the\r\nGovernor-General but his term of real authority in Upper Canada ended\r\non November 22nd, 1839, when the new Governor-General assumed the\r\ngovernment of the upper province.\r\n\r\nSir George Arthur remained in Upper Canada until 1841, when the Act\r\nof Union came into force and the two provinces surrendered their\r\nseparate existence.  He then returned to England where his services\r\nin Canada were recognized by the bestowal upon him of a baronetcy.\r\nIn June, 1842, he was appointed Governor of the Bombay Presidency in\r\nIndia, which office he held until his retirement in 1846.  Had his\r\nhealth warranted the acceptance of so difficult a post he might then\r\nhave become Governor-General of India.  After returning to England\r\nSir George Arthur was made a Privy Councillor and was honoured by the\r\nUniversity of Oxford with the honorary degree of Doctor of Civil Law.\r\nHe died on September 19th, 1854.\r\n\r\nSir George Arthur was a true type of the old colonial governor.  He\r\nwas unfortunate in that he was unable to realize that the days of\r\ncolonial dependency were numbered, and that the future belonged to\r\nthe advocates of self-government.  His long experience as a colonial\r\ngovernor under the old regime, probably told against Arthur in his\r\nadministration of Upper Canada just as it was of value to him as\r\nGovernor of Bombay.  His support of the Family Compact was as natural\r\nand sincere as his mistrust of Responsible Government.  Of his\r\nuprightness and integrity there could be no doubt.  Although his\r\ntreatment of the political prisoners shows him to have been\r\nmerciless, on occasion he was known as a gentle and kind man.  He\r\ntried to do what he considered right but he lacked vision.\r\nThroughout his administration in Upper Canada he was attempting to\r\nbolster up a dying cause.  His one fatal defect was that he could not\r\nsee that the political future of Canada lay in the proper\r\ninterpretation and elaboration of the principles laid down in Lord\r\nDurham's Report.\r\n\r\n\r\nWALTER SAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Arthur to Glenelg, 29 March, 1838.\r\n\r\n[2] Head's Narrative, p. 32.\r\n\r\n[3] Canadian Archives.
