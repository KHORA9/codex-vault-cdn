The full significance of these\r\nchanges both to China and to the world cannot be comprehended\r\nnow. There is something fascinating and at the same\r\ntime something appalling in the spectacle of a nation numbering\r\nnearly one-third of the human race slowly and majestically\r\nrousing itself from the torpor of ages under the influence of\r\nnew and powerful revolutionary forces. No other movement\r\nof our age is so colossal, no other is more pregnant with\r\nmeaning. In the words of D. C. Bougler, ``The grip of the outer\r\nworld has tightened round China. It will either strangle her\r\nor galvanize her into fresh life.''\r\n\r\nThe immediate occasion of this volume was the invitation of\r\nthe faculty of Princeton Theological Seminary to deliver a\r\nseries of lectures on China on the Student Lectureship Foundation\r\nand to publish them in book form. This will account in\r\npart for the style of some passages. I have, however, added\r\nconsiderable material which was not included in the lectures,\r\nwhile some articles that were contributed to the Century Magazine,\r\nthe American Monthly Review of Reviews and other\r\nmagazines have been inserted in their proper place in the\r\ndiscussion. The materials were gathered not only in study and\r\ncorrespondence but in an extended tour of Asia in the years\r\n1901 and 1902. In that tour, advantage was taken of every\r\nopportunity to confer with Chinese of all classes, foreign\r\nconsuls, editors, business men and American, German and British\r\nofficials, as well as with missionaries of all denominations.\r\nEverywhere I was cordially received, and, as I look at my\r\nvoluminous note-books, I am very grateful to the men of all\r\nfaiths and nationalities who so generously aided me in my\r\nsearch for information.\r\n\r\nNo one system of spelling Chinese names has been followed\r\nfor the simple reason that no one has been generally accepted.\r\nThe Chinese characters represent words and ideas rather than\r\nletters and can only be phonetically reproduced in English.\r\nUnfortunately, scholars differ widely as to this phonetic spelling,\r\nwhile each nationality works in its own peculiarities wherever\r\npracticable. And so we have Manchuria, Mantchuria and\r\nManchouria; Kiao-chou, Kiau-Tshou, Kiao-Chau, Kiau-\r\ntschou and Kiao-chow; Chinan and Tsi-nan; Ychou, Ichow\r\nand I-chou; Tsing-tau and Ching-Dao; while Mukden is confusingly\r\nknown as Moukden , Shen-Yang, Feng-tien-fu and Sheng-\r\nking. As some authors follow one system, some another and some\r\nnone at all, and as usage varies in different parts of the Empire,\r\nan attempt at uniformity would have involved the correction\r\nof quotations and the changing of forms that have the sanction\r\nof established usage as, for example, the alteration of\r\nChefoo to Chi-fu or Tshi-fu. I have deemed it wise, as a rule,\r\nto omit the aspirate (e. g, Tai-shan instead of T'ai-shan) as\r\nunintelligible to one who does not speak Chinese. Few\r\nforeigners except missionaries can pronounce Chinese names\r\ncorrectly anyway. Besides, no matter what the system of spelling,\r\nthe pronunciation differs, the Chinese themselves in various\r\nparts of the Empire pronouncing the name of the Imperial\r\nCity Beh-ging, Bay-ging, Bai-ging and Bei-jing, while most\r\nforeigners pronounce it Pe-kin or Pi-king. I have followed the\r\nbest obtainable advice in using the hyphen between the different\r\nparts of many proper names. For the rest I join the\r\nperplexed reader who devoutly hopes that the various commit-\r\ntees that are at work on the Romanization of the Chinese language\r\nmay in time agree among themselves and evolve a system\r\nthat a plain, wayfaring man can understand without provocation\r\nto wrath.\r\n   156 Fifth Avenue,\r\n     New York City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface to the Second Edition\r\n\r\nTHE author gratefully acknowledges the kindness with\r\nwhich his book has been received not only in this\r\ncountry but in England and China. In this edition\r\nhe has corrected a number of errors that appeared in the first\r\nedition and has availed himself of later statistical information.\r\nHe is under special obligations to the Rev. W. A. P. Martin,\r\nD. D., LL. D., of Wuchang, and the Rev. Arthur H. Smith,\r\nD. D. LL. D., of Pang-chwang, for valuable counsel. These\r\ndistinguished authorities on China have been so kind as to\r\nstudy the book with painstaking care and to give the author\r\nthe benefit of their suggestions. All these suggestions have\r\nbeen incorporated in this edition to the great improvement of\r\nits accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe result of the Russia-Japan War is noticeably accelerating\r\nthe new movement in China. The Chinese have been as\r\nmuch startled and impressed by the Japanese victory as the\r\nrest of the world and they are more and more disposed to follow\r\nthe path which the Japanese have so successfully marked\r\nout. The considerations presented in this book are therefore\r\neven more true to-day than when they were first published.\r\nThe problem of the future is plainly the problem of China and\r\nno thoughtful person can afford to be indifferent to the vast\r\ntransformation which is taking place as the result of the operation\r\nof the great formative forces of the modern world.\r\n\r\n   156 Fifth Avenue,\r\n     New York City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContents\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nOLD CHINA AND ITS PEOPLE\r\n\r\nI.

Beyond any other part of the earth, its\r\nsoil teems with historic associations. Here was the birthplace\r\nof the human race. Here first appeared civilization. Here\r\nwere born art and science, learning and philosophy. Here man\r\nfirst engaged in commerce and manufacture. And here\r\nemerged all the religious teachers who have most powerfully\r\ninfluenced mankind, for it was in Asia in an unknown antiquity\r\nthat the Persian Zoroaster taught the dualism of good and\r\nevil; that the Indian Gautama 600 years before Christ declared\r\nthat self-abnegation was the path to a dreamless Nirvana; that\r\nless than a century later the Chinese Lao-tse enunciated the\r\nmysteries of Taoism and Confucius uttered his maxims\r\nregarding the five earthly relations of man, to be followed within\r\nanother century by the bold teaching of Mencius that kings\r\nshould rule in righteousness. In Asia it was 1,000 years\r\nafterwards that the Arabian Mohammed proclaimed himself as the\r\nauthoritative prophet. There the God and Father of us all\r\nrevealed Himself to Hebrew sage and prophet in the night vision\r\nand the angelic form and the still, small voice; and in Asia are\r\nthe village in which was cradled and the great altar of the\r\nworld on which was crucified the Son of God.\r\n\r\nWe of the West boast of our national history. But how brief\r\nis our day compared with the succession of world powers which\r\nAsia has seen.\r\n\r\nChaldea began the march of kingdoms 2,200 years before\r\nChrist. Its proud king, Chedor-laomer, ruled from the Persian\r\nGulf to the sources of the Euphrates, and from the Zagros\r\nMountains to the Mediterranean. Then Egypt arose to rule\r\nnot only over the northeastern part of Africa, but over half of\r\nArabia and all of the preceding territory of Chaldea. Assyria\r\nfollowed, stretching from the Black Sea nearly half-way down\r\nthe Persian Gulf and from the Mediterranean to the eastern\r\nboundary of modern Persia. Babylon, too, was once a world\r\npower whose monarch sat\r\n\r\n   ``High on a throne of royal state, which far\r\n     Outshone the wealth of Ormus or of Ind.''[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Milton, ``Paradise Lost,'' Book II.\r\n\r\nPersia was mightier still. Two thousand years before America\r\nwas heard of, while France and Germany, England and Spain,\r\nwere savage wildernesses, Persia was the abode of civilization\r\nand culture, of learning and eloquence. Her empire extended\r\nfrom the Indus to the Danube and from the Oxus to the Nile,\r\nembracing twenty satrapies each one of whose governors was\r\nwell-nigh a king. Alexander the Great, too, at the head of\r\nhis invincible army, swept over vast areas of Asia, capturing\r\ncities, unseating rulers, and bringing well-nigh all the civilized\r\nworld under his dominion. And was not Rome also an Asiatic\r\npower, for it stretched not only from the firths of Scotland\r\non the north to the deserts of Africa on the south, but\r\nfrom the Atlantic Ocean on the west to the River Euphrates on\r\nthe east.\r\n\r\nAltogether it is a majestic but awful procession, overwhelming\r\nus by its grandeur and yet no less by its horror. It is\r\na kaleidoscope on a colossal scale, whose pieces appear like\r\nfragments of a broken universe. Empires rise and fall.\r\nThrones are erected and overturned. The mightiest creations\r\nof man vanish. Yea, they have all waxed ``old as doth a garment,''\r\nand ``as a vesture'' are they ``changed.''\r\n\r\nBut were these ancient nations the last of Asia? Has that\r\nmighty continent nothing more to contribute to the world than\r\nthe memories of a mighty past? It is impossible to believe\r\nthat this is all. The historic review gives a momentum which\r\nthe mind cannot easily overcome. As we look towards the Far\r\nEast, we can plainly see that the evolution is incomplete.\r\nWhatever purpose the Creator had in mind has certainly not yet been\r\naccomplished. More than two-thirds of those innumerable\r\nmyriads have as yet never heard of those high ideals of life and\r\ndestiny which God Himself revealed to men. It is incredible\r\nthat a wise God should have made such a large part of the\r\nworld only to arrest its development at its present unfinished\r\nstage, inconceivable that He should have made and preserved\r\nso large a part of the human race for no other and higher purpose\r\nthan has yet been achieved.\r\n\r\nWithin this generation, a new Asiatic power has suddenly\r\nappeared in a part of Asia far removed from the region in which\r\nthe wise men of old lived and studied, and the might of\r\nthat nation is even now checking the progress of huge and\r\nhaughty Russia. But brilliant as has been the meteoric career\r\nof Japan, there is another race in Asia, which, though now\r\nmoving more sluggishly, has possibilities of development that\r\nmay in time make it a dominant factor in the future of the\r\nworld. Great forces are now operating on that race and it is\r\nthe purpose of this book to give some account of those forces\r\nand to indicate the stupendous transformation which they are\r\nslowly but surely producing.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of China is almost overwhelming. In spite\r\nof all that I had read, I was amazed by what I saw. To say\r\nthat the Empire has an area of 4,218,401 square miles is almost\r\nlike saying that it is 255,000,000,000 miles to the North Star;\r\nthe statement conveys no intelligible idea. The mind is only\r\nconfused by such enormous figures. But it may help us to remember\r\nthat China is one-third larger than all Europe, and that if the\r\nUnited States and Alaska could be laid upon China there\r\nwould be room left for several Great Britains. Extending from\r\nthe fifty-fourth parallel of latitude southward to the eighteenth,\r\nthe Empire has every variety of climate from arctic cold to\r\ntropic heat. It is a land of vast forests, of fertile soil, of rich\r\nminerals, of navigable rivers. The very fact that it has so long\r\nsustained such a vast population suggests the richness of its\r\nresources. There are said to be 600,000,000 acres of arable soil,\r\nand so thriftily is it cultivated that many parts of the Empire\r\nare almost continuous gardens and fields. Four hundred and\r\nnineteen thousand square miles are believed to be underlaid\r\nwith coal. Baron von Richthofen thinks that 600,000,000,000\r\ntons of it are anthracite, and that the single Province of Shen-si\r\ncould supply the entire world for a thousand years. When we\r\nadd to this supply of coal the apparently inexhaustible deposits\r\nof iron ore, we have the two products on which material greatness\r\nlargely depends.\r\n\r\nThe population proves to be even greater than was supposed,\r\nfor while 400,000,000 was formerly believed to be a maximum\r\nestimate, the general census recently taken by the Chinese\r\nGovernment for the purpose of assessing the war tax places the\r\npopulation of the Empire at 426,000,000. This, however,\r\nincludes 8,500,000 in Manchuria, 2,580,000 in Mongolia,\r\n6,430,020 in Tibet and 1,200,000 in Chinese Turkestan.\r\nSome of these regions are only nominally Chinese. Those on\r\nthe western frontier were until comparatively recent years\r\nalmost as unknown as the poles. Sven Hedin's description of\r\nthose that he traversed is wonderfully fascinating. Only a\r\ndaring spirit, the explorer of the type that is born, not made,\r\ncould have pierced those vast solitudes and wrested from them\r\nthe secret of their existence. That Hedin had no money for\r\nsuch a costly quest could not deter this Viking of the Northland.\r\nKings headed the subscription and others so eagerly followed\r\nthat ample funds were soon in hand. Princes helped with\r\nequipment and counsel. The Czar made all Russian railways\r\nfree highways, and every local official and nomad chieftain\r\nexerted himself to aid the expedition. Hedin does not claim\r\nto give anything more than an ordered diary of his travels,\r\ntogether with a description of the lands he explored and the\r\npeoples he found. But what a diary it is! It takes the reader\r\naway from the whirl of crowded cities and clanging trolley-cars\r\ninto the boundless, wind-swept desert and the solitude of\r\nmajestic mountains where the lonely traveller wanders with his\r\ncamels through untrodden wildernesses or floats down the\r\ninterminable stretches of unknown rivers, while night after\r\nnight he sleeps in his tiny tent or under the open sky. The\r\nauthor failed to reach the long-sought Lassa, the suspicious\r\nDalai Lama refusing to be deceived or cajoled and sternly sending\r\nthe inquisitive traveller out of the country. But the expedition\r\nof three years and three days was rich in other disclosures of\r\nruined cities and great watercourses and lofty plateaus and\r\nmajestic mountain ranges. The population is sparse in those\r\ndesolate wastes, and the scattered inhabitants are wild and\r\nuncouth and free.\r\n\r\nManchuria, however, is far from being the barren country\r\nthat so many imagine it to be. It is, in many respects, like\r\nCanada, a region embracing about 370,000 square miles and of\r\nalmost boundless agricultural and mineral wealth. The\r\npopulation, save in the southern parts, is not yet dense but it is\r\nrapidly increasing.\r\n\r\nBut in central and eastern China, the conditions are very\r\ndifferent. Here the population can only be indicated by a\r\nfigure so large that it is almost impossible for us to comprehend\r\nit. Consider that the eighteen provinces alone, with an\r\narea about equal to that part of the United States east of the\r\nMississippi River, have eight times the population of that\r\npart of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n``There are twice as many people in China as on the four continents--\r\nAfrica, North and South America and Oceanica. Every third person\r\nwho toils under the sun and sleeps under God's stars is a Chinese.\r\nEvery third child born into the world looks into the face of a Chinese\r\nmother. Every third pair given in marriage plight their troth in a\r\nChinese cup of wine. Every third orphan weeping through the day\r\nevery third widow wailing through the night are in China. Put them in\r\nrank, joining hands, and they will girdle the globe ten times at the\r\nequator with living, beating human hearts. Constitute them pilgrims and let\r\ntwo thousand go past every day and night under the sunlight and\r\nunder the solemn stars, and you must hear the ceaseless tramp, tramp, of\r\nthe weary, pressing, throbbing throng for five hundred years.''[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] The Rev. J. T. Gracey, D. D., ``China in Outline,'' p. 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is something amazing in the immensity of the population.\r\nGreat cities are surprisingly numerous. In America, a\r\ncity of nearly a million inhabitants is a wonderful place and all\r\nthe world is supposed to know about it. But while Canton and\r\nTien-tsin are tolerably familiar names, how many in the United\r\nStates ever heard of Hsiang-tan-hsien ? Yet Hsiang-tan-\r\nhsien is said to have 1,000,000 inhabitants, while within comparatively\r\nshort distances are other great cities and innumerable\r\nvillages. In the Swatow region, within a territory a\r\nhundred and fifty miles long and fifty miles wide, there are no\r\nless than ten walled cities of from 40,000 to 250,000 inhabitants,\r\nbesides hundreds of towns and villages ranging from a few\r\nhundred to 25,000 or 30,000 people. Men never tire of writing\r\nabout the population adjacent to New York, Boston and\r\nChicago. But in five weeks' constant journeying through the\r\ninterior of the Shantung Province, there was hardly an hour in\r\nwhich multitudes were not in sight. There are no scattered\r\nfarmhouses as in America, but the people live in villages and\r\ntowns, the latter strongly walled and even the former often have\r\na mud wall. As the country is comparatively level, it was easy\r\nto count them, and as a rule there were a dozen or more in\r\nplain view. I recall a memorable morning. It was Friday,\r\nJune 28, 1901. We had risen early, and by daylight we had\r\nbreakfasted, and started our carts and litters. In our enjoyment\r\nof the cool, delicious morning air, we walked for several\r\nli. Just before the sun rose, we crossed a low ridge and from\r\nits crest, I counted no less than thirty villages in front of us,\r\nwhile behind there were about as many more, the average\r\npopulation being apparently about 500 each. For days at a time,\r\nmy road lay through the narrow, crowded street of what seemed\r\nto be an almost continuous village, the intervening farms being\r\noften hardly more than a mile in width.\r\n\r\nImagine half the population of the United States packed into\r\nthe single state of Missouri and an idea of the situation will be\r\nobtained, for with an area almost equal to that of Missouri,\r\nShantung has no less than 38,247,900 inhabitants. It is the\r\nmost densely populated part of China. But the Province of\r\nShan-si is as thickly settled as Hungary. Fukien and Hupeh\r\nhave about as many inhabitants to the square mile as England.\r\nChih-li is as populous as France and Yun-nan as Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nThe density of China's population may be better realized by\r\na glance at the following detailed comparison between the\r\npopulation of Chinese provinces and the population of similar\r\nareas in the United States:\r\n\r\n                                 Area\r\n Provinces                   Square miles       Population\r\n\r\n Hupeh,                        71,410           35,280,685\r\n Ohio and Indiana              76,670            5,864,720\r\n Honan,                        67,940           35,316,800\r\n Missouri,                     68,735            2,679,184\r\n Cheh-kiang,                   36,670           11,580,692\r\n Kentucky,                     40,000            1,858,635\r\n Kiang-si,                     69,480           26,532,125\r\n Kentucky and Tennessee,       81,750            3,626,252\r\n Kwei-chou,                    67,160            7,650,292\r\n Virginia and West Virginia,   64,770            2,418,774\r\n Yun-nan,                     146,680           12,324,574\r\n Michigan and Wisconsin,      111,880            3,780,769\r\n Fukien,                       46,320           22,876,540\r\n Ohio,                         40,760            3,762,316\r\n Chih-li,                     115,800           20,937,000\r\n Georgia,                      50,980            1,837,353\r\n Shantung,                     55,970           38,247,900\r\n New England,                  62,000            4,700,945\r\n Shan-si,                      81,830           12,200,456\r\n Illinois,                     56,000            3,826,85l\r\n Shen-si,                      75,270            8,450,182\r\n Nebraska,                     76,840            1,058,910\r\n Kan-su,                      125,450           10,385,376\r\n California,                  155,980            1,208,130\r\n Sze-chuen,                   218,480           68,724,890\r\n Ohio, Ind., Ill., Ky.,       173,430           11,350,219\r\n Ngan-hwei,                    54,810           23,670,314\r\n New York,                     47,600            5,997,853\r\n Klang-su,                     38,600           13,980,235\r\n Pennsylvania,                 44,985            5,258,014\r\n Kwan-tung and Hainan,         99,970           31,865,251\r\n Kansas,                       81,700            1,427,096\r\n Kwang-si,                     77,200            5,142,330\r\n Minnesota,                    79,205            1,301,826\r\n Hunan,                        83,380           22,169,673\r\n Louisiana,                    45,000            1,110,569\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most thoroughly typical city in China is Canton.\r\nThe approach by way of the West River from Hongkong\r\ngives the traveller a view of some of the finest scenery in China.\r\nThe green rice-fields, the villages nestling beneath the groves,\r\nthe stately palm-trees, the quaint pagodas, the broad, smooth\r\nreaches of the river reflecting the glories of sunset and moon-\r\nrises and the noble hills in the background combine to form a\r\nscene worth journeying far to see.\r\n\r\nBut Canton itself is unique among the world's great cities,\r\nand the most sated traveller cannot fail to find much that will\r\ninterest him. After much journeying in China, we thought we\r\nhad seen its typical places, but no one has seen China until he\r\nhas visited Canton. With an estimated population of 1,800,000,\r\nit is the metropolis of the Empire. The number of people\r\nper acre may be less than in some parts of the East Side in New\r\nYork, for the houses are only one story in height. But the\r\ncrowding is amazing. The streets are mere alleys from four to\r\neight feet wide, lined with open-front shops, so filled overhead\r\nwith perpendicular signs and cross coverings of bamboo poles\r\nand mattings that they are in as perpetual shade as an African\r\nforest, and so choked with people that men often had to back\r\ninto a shop to let our chairs pass. No wheeled vehicle can\r\nenter those corkscrew streets and we saw no animal of any kind\r\nsave two cows that were being led to slaughter.\r\n\r\nAnd the hubbub! Such shouting and yelling cannot be\r\nheard anywhere else in the world. Our chair coolies were in a\r\nconstant state of objurgation in clearing a way. Everybody\r\nseemed to be bellowing to everybody else and when two chairs\r\nmet, the din shattered the atmosphere. A foreigner excites a\r\nsurprising amount of curiosity, considering the number that\r\nvisit Canton. Troops of boys followed us and there was a good\r\ndeal of what sounded like cat-calling. But it was all good-\r\nnatured, or appeared to be.\r\n\r\nThe unpretentious shop-fronts often beckon to mysteries that\r\nare well worth penetrating--tobacco factories where coolies\r\nstamp the leaves with bare feet; tea, gold, dye and embroidery\r\nshops where designs of exquisite delicacy are exhibited; silk-\r\nweaving factories where fine fabrics are made on the simplest of\r\nlooms; feather shops where breastpins and other ornaments\r\nare made of tiny bits of feathers on a silver base--a work\r\nrequiring almost incredible nicety of vision and such strain upon\r\nthe eyes that the operators often become blind by forty. Another\r\ncuriosity is a shop where crickets are reared for fighting\r\nas the Filipino fights cocks and the Anglo-Saxon fights dogs.\r\nThe Chinese gamble on the result and a good fighting cricket is\r\nsometimes sold for $100. The attendant put a couple in a jar\r\nfor our alleged amusement and they began fighting fiercely.\r\nBut I promptly stopped the melee as I did not enjoy such sport.\r\n\r\nThe river is one of the sights of China. It is crowded with\r\nboats of all sizes. The owner of each lives on it with his\r\nfamily, the babies having ropes tied to them so that if they\r\ntumble into the water, they can be pulled out.\r\n\r\nAltogether, it is a remarkable city. Viewed from the famous\r\nFive-Story Pagoda, on a high part of the old city wall, it is a\r\nswarming hive of humanity. As one looks out on those myriads\r\nof toiling, struggling, sorrowing men and women, he is\r\nconscious of a new sense of the pathos and the tragedy of human\r\nlife. If I may adapt the words of the Rev. Dr. Richard S.\r\nStorrs on the heights above Naples, at the Church of San Mar-\r\ntino, on the way to St. Elmo--I suppose that every one who\r\nhas ever stood on the balcony of that lofty pagoda ``has\r\nnoticed, as I remember to have noticed, that all the sounds\r\ncoming up from that populous city, as they reached the upper\r\nair, met and mingled on the minor key. There were the voices\r\nof traffic, and the voices of command, the voices of affection\r\nand the voices of rebuke, the shouts of sailors, and the cries of\r\nitinerant venders in the street, with the chatter and the laugh\r\nof childhood; but they all came up into this incessant moan in\r\nthe air. That is the voice of the world in the upper air, where\r\nthere are spirits to hear it. That is the cry of the world for\r\nhelp.''[3]\r\n\r\n[3] ``Address on Foreign Missions,'' pp. 178, 179.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nDO WE RIGHTLY VIEW THE CHINESE\r\n\r\nTOO much has been made of the peculiarities of the\r\nChinese, ignoring the fact that many customs and\r\ntraits that appear peculiar to us are simply the differences\r\ndeveloped by environment. Eliza Scidmore affirms that\r\n``no one knows or ever really will know the Chinese, the most\r\ncomprehensible, inscrutable, contradictory, logical, illogical\r\npeople on earth.'' But a Chinese gentleman, who was\r\neducated in the United States, justly retorts: ``Behold the\r\nAmerican as he is, as I honestly found him--great, small, good, bad,\r\nself-glorious, egotistical, intellectual, supercilious, ignorant,\r\nsuperstitious, vain and bombastic. In truth,'' he adds, ``so\r\nvery remarkable, so contradictory, so incongruous have I found\r\nthe American that I hesitate.''[4]\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] ``As a Chinaman Saw Us,'' pp. 1, 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chinese are, indeed, very different from western peoples\r\nin some of their customs.\r\n\r\n\r\n``They mount a horse on the right side instead of the left. The old\r\nmen play marbles and fly kites, while children look gravely on. They\r\nshake hands with themselves instead of with each other. What we call\r\nthe surname is written first and the other name afterwards. A coffin is a\r\nvery acceptable present to a rich parent in good health. In the north\r\nthey sail and pull their wheelbarrows in place of merely pushing them.\r\n\r\nChina is a country where the roads have no carriages and the\r\nships have no keels; where the needle points to the south, the place of\r\nhonour is on the left hand, and the seat of intellect is supposed to lie in the\r\nstomach; where it is rude to take off your hat, and to wear white clothes\r\nis to go into mourning. Can one be astonished to find a literature without\r\nan alphabet and a language without a grammar?''[5]\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] Temple Bar, quoted in Smith's ``Rex Christus,'' p. 115.\r\n\r\nIt would never occur to us to commit suicide in order to\r\nspite another. But in China such suicides occur every day,\r\nbecause it is believed that a death on the premises is a lasting\r\ncurse to the owner. And so the Chinese drowns himself in his\r\nenemy's well or takes poison on his foe's door-step. Only a\r\nfew months ago, a rich Chinese murdered an employee in a\r\nBritish colony, and knowing that inexorable British law would\r\nnot be satisfied until some one was punished, he hired a poor\r\nChinese named Sack Chum to confess to having committed the\r\nmurder and to permit himself to be hung, the real murderer\r\npromising to give him a good funeral and to care for his family.\r\nAn Englishman who thought this an incredible story wrote a\r\nletter of inquiry to an intelligent Chinese merchant of his\r\nacquaintance and received the following reply:\r\n\r\n\r\n``Nothing strange to Chinamen. Sack Chum, old man, no money, soon\r\ndie. Every day in China such thing. Chinaman not like white man--\r\nnot afraid to die. Suppose some one pay his funeral, take care his family.\r\n`I die,' he say. Chinaman know Sack Chum, we suppose, sell himself to\r\nmen who kill Ah Chee. Somebody must die for them. Sack Chum say\r\nhe do it. All right. Police got him. What for they want more?''\r\n\r\n\r\nThese things appear odd from our view-point and there are\r\nmany other peculiarities that are equally strange to us. But it\r\nmay be wholesome for us to remember that some of our customs\r\nimpress the Chinese no less oddly. The Frankfurter Zeitung,\r\nGermany, prints the following from a Chinese who had seen\r\nmuch of the Europeans and Americans in Shanghai:\r\n\r\n\r\n``We are always told that the countries of the foreign devils are grand\r\nand rich; but that cannot be true, else what do they all come here for?\r\nIt is here that they grow rich. They jump around and kick balls as if\r\nthey were paid to do it. Again you will find them making long tramps\r\ninto the country; but that is probably a religious duty, for when they\r\ntramp they wave sticks in the air, nobody knows why. They have no\r\nsense of dignity, for they may be found walking with women. Yet the\r\nwomen are to be pitied, too. On festive occasions they are dragged\r\naround a room to the accompaniment of the most hellish music.''\r\n\r\n\r\nA Chinese resident in America wrote to his friends at home\r\na letter from which the following extract is taken:\r\n\r\n\r\n``What is queerer still, men will stroll out in company with their wives\r\nin broad daylight without a blush. And will you believe that men and\r\nwomen take hold of each other's hands by way of salutation? Oh, I have\r\nseen it myself more than once. After all, what can you expect of folk\r\nwho have been brought up in barbarous countries on the very verge of\r\nthe world? They have not been taught the maxims of our sages; they\r\nnever heard of the Rites; how can they know what good manners mean?\r\nWe often think them rude and insolent when I'm sure they don't mean it\r\nthey're ignorant, that's all.''[6]\r\n\r\n[6] Smith, ``Rex Christus,'' p. 116.\r\n\r\n\r\nA call that I made upon a high official in an interior city\r\ndeveloped a curious interest. He was a pale, thin man,\r\napparently an opium smoker and a mandarin of the old school.\r\nBut he was intelligent enough to ask me not only about ``the\r\ntwenty-story buildings of New York,'' but ``the differences\r\nbetween the various Protestant sects,'' and in particular about\r\n``the Mormons and their strength!'' Who could have\r\nimagined that the Latter Day Saints of Utah could be known to a\r\nChinese nobleman of Chih-li? Verily, our own idiosyncrasies\r\nare known afar.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that mutual recriminations regarding\r\nnational peculiarities are not likely to be convincing to either\r\nparty. Human nature is much the same the world over. From\r\nthis view-point at least we may discreetly remember that\r\n\r\n     ``There is so much bad in the best of us,\r\n     And so much good in the worst of us,\r\n     That it hardly behoves any of us\r\n     To talk about the rest of us.''\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not mean to give an exaggerated impression of the\r\nvirtues of the Chinese or what Mrs. Isabella Bird Bishop calls\r\n``a milk-and-water idea'' of heathenism. Undoubtedly, they\r\nhave grave defects. Official corruption is well-nigh universal.\r\nA correspondent of the North China Herald reports a well-\r\ninformed Chinese gentleman of the Province of Chih-li as\r\nexpressing the conviction that one-half the land tax never reaches\r\nthe Government. ``But that is not all,'' said he.\r\n\r\n\r\n``There are other sources of income for the hsien official. Thus here\r\nin this county, thirty-five or forty years ago, the Government imposed an\r\nextra tax for the purpose of putting down the Tai-ping rebellion, and the\r\nofficials have continued to collect that tax ever since. Of course if the\r\nliterati should move in the matter and report to Paoting-fu, the magistrate\r\nwould be bounced at once; but they are not likely to do so. The tax is a\r\nsmall one, my own share not being more than five dollars or so.''\r\n\r\n\r\nChina's whole public service is rotten with corruption.\r\nOffices with merely nominal salaries or none at all are usually\r\nbought by the payment of a heavy bribe and held for a term of\r\nthree years, during which the incumbent seeks not only to\r\nrecoup himself but to make as large an additional sum as\r\npossible. As the weakness of the Government and the absence of\r\nan outspoken public press leave them free from restraint, China\r\nis the very paradise of embezzlers. ``Any man who has had the\r\nleast occasion to deal with Chinese courts knows that `every\r\nman has his price,' that not only every underling can be\r\nbought, but that 999 out of every 1,000 officials, high or low,\r\nwill favour the man who offers the most money.''[7] Dishonesty\r\nis not, as with the white race, simply the recourse in emergency\r\nof the unscrupulous man. It is the habitual practice, the rule\r\nof intercourse of all classes. The Chinese apparently have no\r\nconscience on the subject, but appear to deem it quite praise-\r\nworthy to deceive you if they can.\r\n\r\n\r\n[7] Rev. Dr. C. H. Fenn, Peking.\r\n\r\n\r\nGambling is openly, shamelessly indulged in by all classes.\r\nAs for immorality, the Rev. Dr. J. Campbell Gibson of Swatow\r\nsays that ``while the Chinese are not a moral people, vice has\r\nnever in China as in India, been made a branch of religion.''\r\nBut the Rev. Dr. C. H. Fenn, of Peking, declares ``that every\r\nvillage and town and city--it would not be a very serious ex-\r\naggeration to say every home,--fairly reeks with impurity.''\r\nThe Chinese are, indeed, less openly immoral than the Japanese,\r\nwhile their venerated books abound with the praises of virtue.\r\nBut medical missionaries could tell a dark story of the extent\r\nto which immorality eats into the very warp and woof of\r\nChinese society. The five hundred monks in the Lama\r\nTemple in Peking are notorious not only for turbulence and\r\nrobbery, but for vice. The temple is in a spacious park and\r\nincludes many imposing buildings. The statue of Buddha is\r\nsaid to be the largest in China--a gilded figure about sixty feet\r\nhigh--colossal and rather awe-inspiring in ``the dim religious\r\nlight.'' But in one of the temple buildings, where the two\r\nmonks who accompanied us said that daily prayers were\r\nchanted, I saw representations in brass and gilt that were as\r\nfilthily obscene as anything that I saw in India. There is\r\nimmorality in lands that are called Christian, but it is disavowed\r\nby Christianity, ostracized by decent people and under the ban\r\nof the civil law. But Buddhism puts immorality in its temples\r\nand the Government supports it. This particular temple has\r\nthe yellow tiled roofs that are only allowed on buildings\r\nassociated with the Imperial Court or that are under special\r\nImperial protection. Mr. E. H. Parker, after twenty years'\r\nexperience in China, writes,\r\n\r\n\r\n``The Chinese are undoubtedly a libidinous people, with a decided\r\ninclination to be nasty about it. . . . Rich mandarins are the most\r\nprofligate class. . . . Next come the wealthy merchants. . . . The\r\ncrapulous leisured classes of Peking openly flaunt the worst of vices.\r\n\r\nStill, amongst all classes and ranks the moral sense is decidedly\r\nweak. . . . Offenses which with us are regarded as almost capital--\r\nin any case as infamous crimes--do not count for as much as petty\r\nmisdemeanours in China.[8]\r\n\r\n\r\n[8] ``China,'' pp. 272, 273\r\n\r\n\r\nMore patent to the superficial observer is a cruelty which\r\nappears to be callously indifferent to suffering. This manifests\r\nitself not only in most barbarous punishments but in a thou-\r\nsand incidents of daily life. The day I entered China at\r\nChefoo, I saw a dying man lying beside the road. Hundreds\r\nof Chinese were passing and repassing on the crowded\r\nthoroughfare. But none stopped to help or to pity and the sufferer\r\npassed through his last agony absolutely uncared for and lay\r\nwith glazing eyes and stiffening form all unheeded by the\r\ncareless throng. Twenty-four hours afterwards, he was still lying\r\nthere with his dead face upturned to the silent sky, while the\r\nworld jostled by, buying, laughing, quarrelling, heedless of the\r\ntragedy of human life so near. And when in Ching-chou-fu, I\r\nstopped to see if I could not give some relief to a woman who\r\nwas writhing in the street, I was hastily warned that if I\r\ntouched her unasked, the populace might hold me responsible\r\nin the event of her death and perhaps demand heavy damages,\r\nif, indeed, it did not mob me on the spot. Undoubtedly the\r\nChinese are often deterred from aiding a sufferer because they\r\nfear that if death occurs ``bad luck'' will follow them, a horde of\r\nreal or fictitious relatives will clamour for damages, and perhaps a\r\nrapacious magistrate will take advantage of the opportunity to\r\nmake a criminal charge which can be removed only by a heavy\r\nbribe. And so the sick and poor are often left to die uncared\r\nfor in crowded streets, and drowning children are allowed to\r\nsink within a few yards of boats which might have rescued\r\nthem. But everywhere in China, little attention is paid to\r\nsuffering and many customs seem utterly heartless.\r\n\r\nIn spite, too, of the agnostic teachings of Confucius and\r\ntheir own practical temperament, the Chinese are a very\r\nsuperstitious people and live in constant terror of evil spirits. The\r\ngrossest superstitions prevail among them, while beyond any\r\nother people known to us they are stagnant, spiritually dead,\r\ndensely ignorant of those higher levels of thought and life to\r\nwhich Christianity has raised whole classes in Europe and\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nSome people who are ignorant of the real situation in China\r\nare being misled by an anonymous little book entitled ``Letters\r\nFrom a Chinese Official.'' The author insists that Anglo-Saxon\r\ninstitutions are far inferior to the institutions of China. He\r\ndeclares that ``our religion (Chinese) is more rational than\r\nyours, our morality higher and our institutions more perfect,''\r\nand that there is less real happiness in Europe and America\r\nthan in China. As for Christianity, he regards it as quite\r\nimpracticable. He holds that Confucianism is feasible and that\r\nChristianity is not, and much more to the same effect. There\r\nis strong internal evidence that the author is not a Chinese at all,\r\nbut a cynical European. At any rate, the book is an ex parte\r\nstatement of the most glaring kind, omitting the good in\r\nEurope and America and the bad in China. One who has\r\nvisited the Celestial Empire gasps when he reads that the\r\nChinese houses are ``cheerful and clean,'' that the Chinese live the\r\nlife of the mind and the spirit to a far higher degree than the\r\nChristian peoples of the West, and that Chinese life has a\r\ndignity and peace and beauty which Europe cannot equal. ``Such\r\nsilence! Such sounds! Such perfume! Such colour!''\r\nthe author rhapsodizes. Bishop Graves, of Shanghai, who has\r\nspent a quarter of a century in China and who is therefore\r\npresumably competent to speak, declares:\r\n\r\n\r\n``Far be it from me to belittle the beauty of the Chinese landscape;\r\nbut why did he not leave out that about the perfume? Why, you can\r\nsmell China out at sea! However, it is just as easy to imagine the\r\nperfume as the rest of it, while you are writing. . . . Exaggeration is\r\nthe most conspicuous note of these `Letters.' Any one who has not\r\nseen China can test whether this book is true to fact by comparing it with\r\nany narrative of sober travel, and if he happens to live in China, his own\r\nnose and eyes are a sufficient witness. . . . The writer takes the\r\nworst of our morals, the weakest of our religion, the most debasing of our\r\nindustrial conditions, the most pernicious of our vices, and against them\r\nhe sets not the best that China can show, but an exaggerated picture\r\nwhich is false to fact. This is not argument but trickery, because it\r\npresumes on the fact that one's readers will know no better.''\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed, the Rev. Dr. C. H. Fenn, who has resided in\r\nPeking for ten years, writes that he cannot believe that the\r\nauthor of ``Letters from a Chinese Official'' is a sincere man.\r\nHe continues:\r\n\r\n\r\n``I would be almost willing to assert that it is impossible for a man,\r\nbrought up in China, then spending many years abroad, to return to China\r\nand write such a book in honesty and sincerity of heart. He could not\r\npossibly help knowing that nine-tenths of what he was writing about\r\nChina was absolutely untrue, that her political, legal, social, domestic and\r\npersonal life are rotten to the core, and that only in a few exceptional\r\ncases is any pretence even made of living according to the ethics of\r\nConfucius. It might be possible for an educated man, whose surroundings\r\nhad always been of an exceptionally good character, and who had never\r\ngone outside of his own province or studied foreign books, to write with\r\nsome enthusiasm of the beauties of Chinese life, but not for any one else.''\r\n\r\n\r\nStill, at a time when the Chinese are being vociferously\r\nabused, it is only fair that we should give them credit for the\r\ngood qualities which they do possess. I ask with Dr. William\r\nElliott Griffis: ``In talking of our brother men, what shall\r\nbe our general principle, detraction or fair play? Because\r\nlackadaisical writers picture the Christless nations as in the\r\ninnocence of Eden, shall we, at the antipodes of fact and\r\ntruth, proceed to blacken their characters? Shall we compare\r\nthe worst in Canton, Benares or Zululand, with the best in London,\r\nBerlin or Philadelphia? Surely God cannot look with\r\ncomplacency or hear with delight much of the practical slander\r\nspoken among white folks and Anglo-Saxons of His children\r\nand our brothers.''\r\n\r\nThere has been too much of a disposition to think of the\r\nChinese as a mass, almost as we would regard immense herds\r\nof cattle or shoals of fish. Why not rather think of the\r\nChinese as an individual, as a man of like passions with\r\nourselves? Physically, mentally, and morally he differs from us\r\nonly in degree, not in kind. He has essentially the same hopes\r\nand fears, the same joys and sorrows, the same susceptibility to\r\npain and the same capacity for happiness. Are we not told\r\nthat God ``hath made of one blood all nations of men''?\r\nWe complacently imagine that we are superior to the Chinese.\r\nBut discussing the question as to what constitutes superiority\r\nand inferiority of race, Benjamin Kidd declares that ``we shall\r\nhave to set aside many of our old ideas on the subject. Neither\r\nin respect alone of colour, nor of descent, nor even of the\r\npossession of high intellectual capacity, can science give us any\r\nwarrant for speaking of one race as superior to another.'' Real\r\nsuperiority is the result, not so much of anything inherent in\r\none race as distinguished from another, as of the operation\r\nupon a race and within it of certain uplifting forces. Any\r\nsuperiority that we now possess is due to the action upon us of\r\nthese forces. But they can be brought to bear upon the\r\nChinese as well as upon us. We should avoid the popular\r\nmistake of looking at the Chinese ``as if they were merely\r\nanimals with a toilet, and never see the great soul in a man's\r\nface.''[9] ``There is nothing,'' says Stopford Brooke, ``that needs\r\nso much patience as just judgment of a man. We ought to\r\nknow his education, the circumstances of his life, the friends\r\nhe has made or lost, his temperament, his daily work, the\r\nmotives which filled the act, the health he had at the time--we\r\nought to have the knowledge of God to judge him justly.''\r\n\r\n\r\n[9] George Eliot.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe need in this study a truer idea of the worth and dignity\r\nof man as man, a realization that back of almond eyes and under\r\na yellow skin are all the faculties and the possibilities of a\r\nhuman soul, to grasp the great thought that the Chinese is not\r\nonly a man, but our brother man, made like ourselves in the\r\nimage of God. Let us have the charity which sees beneath all\r\nexternal peculiarities our common humanity, which leads us to\r\nrespect a man because he is a man; which, no matter what\r\ncomplexion he may have, no matter where he lives, no matter\r\nto what degradation he has fallen, will take him by the hand\r\nand endeavour to elevate him to a higher plane of life. For\r\nhim we need an enthusiasm for humanity which shall not be a\r\nsentimental rhetoric, but a catholic, throbbing love, remembering\r\nthat he is\r\n\r\n     ``Heir of the same inheritance,\r\n        Child of the self-same God,\r\n     He hath but stumbled in the path\r\n        We have in weakness trod.''\r\n\r\n\r\nRuskin reminds us that the filthy mud from the street of a\r\nmanufacturing town is composed of clay, sand, soot and water;\r\nthat the clay may be purified into the radiance of the sapphire;\r\nthat the sand may be developed into the beauty of the opal; that\r\nthe soot may be crystallized into the glory of the diamond and\r\nthat the water may be changed into a star of snow. So man in\r\nAsia as well as in America may, by the transforming power of\r\nGod's Spirit, be ennobled into the kingly dignity of divine\r\nsonship. We shall get along best with the Chinese if we remember\r\nthat he is a human being like ourselves, responsive to kindness,\r\nappreciative of justice and capable of moral transformation\r\nunder the influence of the Gospel. He differs from us not\r\nin the fundamental things that make for manhood, but only in\r\nthe superficial things that are the result of environment. From\r\nthis view-point, we can say with Shakespeare:--\r\n\r\n     ``There is some sort of goodness in things evil,\r\n       Would men observingly distil it out.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who are wont to refer so contemptuously to the Chinese\r\nmight profitably recall that when, in Dickens' ``Christmas\r\nCarol,'' the misanthropic Scrooge says of the poor and suffering:\r\n``If he be like to die, he had better do it and decrease\r\nthe surplus population,''--the Ghost sternly replies:--\r\n\r\n``Man, if man you be at heart, not adamant, forbear that wicked cant\r\nuntil you have discovered what the surplus is and where it is. Will you\r\ndecide what men shall live, what men shall die? It may be that in the\r\nsight of heaven, you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions\r\nlike this poor man's child. Ah, God! to hear the insect on the leaf\r\npronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust!''\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nATTITUDE TOWARDS FOREIGNERS--CHARACTER\r\nAND ACHIEVEMENTS\r\n\r\nTO understand China's attitude towards foreigners, the\r\nfollowing considerations must be borne in mind:--\r\n\r\nFirst, the conservative temperament of the Chinese.\r\nIt is true but misleading, to say that they have ``no word or\r\nwritten character for patriotism, but 150 ways of writing the\r\ncharacters for good luck and longlife.'' For while the Chinese\r\nmay have little love for country, they have an intense\r\ndevotion to their own customs. For nearly 5,000 years, while\r\nother empires have risen, flourished and fallen, they have lived\r\napart, sufficient unto themselves, cherishing their own ideals,\r\nplodding along their well-worn paths, ignorant of or indifferent\r\nto the progress of the Western world, mechanically memorizing\r\ndead classics, and standing still comparatively amid the\r\ntremendous onrush of modern civilization. I say comparatively\r\nstill, for if we carefully study Chinese history, we shall find\r\nthat this vast nation has not been so inert as we have long\r\nsupposed. The very revolutions and internal commotions of all\r\nkinds through which China has passed would have prevented\r\nmere inertia. But when we compare these movements and the\r\nchanges that they have wrought with the kaleidoscopic\r\ntransformations in Europe and America, China appears the most\r\nstationary of nations. She has moved less in centuries than\r\nwestern peoples have in decades. The restless Anglo-Saxon is\r\nalternately irritated and awed by this massive solidity, not to\r\nsay stolidity. There is, after all, something impressive about\r\nit, the impressiveness of a mighty glacier which moves, indeed,\r\nbut so slowly and majestically that the duration of an ordinary\r\nnation's life appears insignificant as compared with the almost\r\ntimeless majesty of the Chinese Empire.\r\n\r\nSecond, the vastness of China. Her territory and population\r\nare so enormous that her people found sufficient scope for\r\ntheir energies within their own borders. They therefore felt\r\nindependent of outsiders. The typical European nation is so\r\nlimited in area and is so near to equally civilized and powerful\r\npeoples that it could not if it would live unto itself. The\r\nsituation of most nations forces them into relations with others.\r\nBut China had a third of the human race and a tenth of the\r\nhabitable globe entirely to herself, with no neighbours who had\r\nanything that she really cared for. It was inevitable, therefore,\r\nthat a naturally conservative people should become a self-\r\ncentred and self-satisfied people.\r\n\r\nThird, the character of adjacent nations. None of them\r\nwere equal to the Chinese in civilization and learning, while in\r\nterritory and population, they were relatively insignificant.\r\nEven Japan, by far the most powerful of them, has only a tenth\r\nof China's population, while her remarkable progress in intelligence\r\nand power is a matter of less than a couple generations.\r\nUntil recently, indeed, Japan was as backward as China and\r\nwas not ashamed to receive many of her ideas from her larger\r\nneighbour, as the number of Chinese characters in the Japanese\r\nlanguage plainly show. As for China's other neighbours, who\r\nwere they? Weak nations which abjectly sent tribute by\r\ncommissioners who grovelled before the august Emperor of the\r\nMiddle Kingdom, or barbarous tribes which the Chinese\r\nregarded about as Americans regard the aboriginal Indians.\r\nGibson translates the following passage from a Chinese historian\r\nas illustrative at once of China's haughty contempt of\r\noutsiders and of her reasons for it:\r\n\r\n\r\n``The former kings in measuring out the land put the Imperial territory\r\nin the centre. Inside was the Chinese Empire, and outside were the\r\nbarbarous nations. The barbarians are covetous and greedy of gain. Their\r\nhair hangs down over their bodies, and their coats are buttoned on the\r\nleft side. They have human faces, but the hearts of beasts. They are\r\ndistinguished from the natives of the Empire both by their manners and\r\ntheir dress. They differ both in their customs and their food, and in\r\nlanguage they are utterly unintelligible. . . . On this account the ancient\r\nsage kings treated them like birds and beasts. They did not contract\r\ntreaties, nor did they attack them. To form a treaty is simply to spend\r\ntreasure and to be deceived; to attack them is simply to wear out the\r\ntroops and provoke raids. . . . Thus the outer are not to be brought\r\ninside. They must be held at a distance, avoiding familiarity. . . . If\r\nthey show a leaning towards right principles and present tributary\r\nofferings, they should be treated with a yielding etiquette; but bridling and\r\nrepression must never be relaxed for conforming to circumstance. Such\r\nwas the constant principle of the sage monarchs in ruling and controlling\r\nthe barbarian tribes.''\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that when foreigners\r\nfrom the distant West sought to force their way into\r\nChina, the Chinese, knowing nothing of the countries\r\nfrom which they came, should have regarded them in accordance\r\nwith their traditional belief and policy regarding the\r\ninferiority of all outsiders.\r\n\r\nThe resultant difficulty was intensified by the\r\nindifference, to use no harsher term, of the foreigner to\r\nthe fact that the Chinese are a very ceremonious people,\r\nextremely punctilious in all social relations and disposed to\r\nregard a breach of etiquette as a cardinal sin. ``Face'' is a\r\nnational institution which must be preserved at all hazards.\r\nNo one can get along with the Chinese who does not respect it.\r\n\r\n\r\n``It is an integral part of both Chinese theory and practice that realities\r\nare of much less importance than appearances. If the latter can be\r\nsaved, the former may be altogether surrendered. This is the essence of\r\nthat mysterious `face' of which we are never done hearing in China.\r\nThe line of Pope might be the Chinese national motto: `Act well your\r\npart, there all the honour lies'; not, be it observed, doing well what is to be\r\ndone, but consummate acting, contriving to convey the appearance of a\r\nthing or a fact, whatever the realities may be. This is Chinese high art;\r\nthis is success. It is self-respect, and it involves and implies the respect\r\nof others. It is, in a word, `face.' The preservation of `face'\r\nfrequently requires that one should behave in an arbitrary and violent\r\nmanner merely to emphasize his protests against the course of current events.\r\nHe or she must fly into a violent rage, he or she must use reviling and\r\nperhaps imprecatory language, else it will not be evident to the spectators\r\nof the drama, in which he is at the moment acting, that he is aware just\r\nwhat ought to be done by a person in his precise situation; and then he\r\nwill have `no way to descend from the stage,' or in other words, he will\r\nhave lost `face.' ''[10]\r\n\r\n[10] Smith, ``Rex Christus,'' pp. 107, 108.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven in death this remains the ruling passion. Chinese\r\ncoffins require much wood and are an expensive\r\nburden in this land where timber is scarce, for Confucius said\r\nthat a coffin should be five inches thick. So the poorer\r\nChinese thriftily meet this requirement by making the sides and\r\nends hollow! Thus ``face'' is saved.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances, it was very important that the\r\nrelations of Europeans to China should be characterized not only\r\nby justice but by tact and at least decent respect for the\r\nfeelings and customs of the people. The chief cause of China's\r\nhostility to foreigners undoubtedly lies in the notorious and\r\noften contemptuous disregard of these things by the majority\r\nof the white men who have entered China and by the Governments\r\nwhich have backed them.\r\n\r\nThere is much in the Chinese that is worthy of our respectful\r\nrecognition. Multitudes are indeed, stolid and ignorant,\r\nbut multitudes, too, have strong, intelligent features. Thousands\r\nof children have faces as bright and winning as those of\r\nAmerican children. More strongly than ever do I feel that\r\nEurope and America have not done justice to the character of\r\nthe Chinese. I do not refer to the bigoted and corrupt Manchu\r\nofficials, or to the lawless barbarians who, like the ``lewd fellows\r\nof the baser sort'' in other lands, are ever ready to follow the\r\nleadership of a demagogue. But I refer to the Chinese people\r\nas a whole. Their view-point is so radically different from\r\nours that we have often harshly misjudged them, when the real\r\ntrouble has lain in our failure to understand them.\r\n\r\nLet us be free enough from prejudice and passion to respect\r\na people whose national existence has survived the mutations\r\nof a definitely known historic period of thirty-seven centuries\r\nand of an additional legendary period that runs back no man\r\nknows how far into the haze of a hoary antiquity; who are\r\nfrugal, patient, industrious and respectful to parents, as we are\r\nnot; whose astronomers made accurate recorded observations\r\n200 years before Abraham left Ur; who used firearms at the\r\nbeginning of the Christian era; who first grew tea, manufactured\r\ngunpowder, made pottery, glue and gelatine; who wore\r\nsilk and lived in houses when our ancestors wore the undressed\r\nskins of wild animals and slept in caves; who invented printing\r\nby movable types 500 years before that art was known in\r\nEurope; who discovered the principles of the mariner's compass\r\nwithout which the oceans could not be crossed, conceived\r\nthe idea of artificial inland waterways and dug a canal 600\r\nmiles long; who made mountain roads which, in the opinion of\r\nDr. S. Wells Williams, ``when new probably equalled in\r\nengineering and construction anything of the kind ever built by\r\nRomans;'' and who invented the arch to which our modern\r\narchitecture is so greatly indebted.\r\n\r\nIn the Great Bell Temple two miles from Peking is one of\r\nthe wonderful bells of the world. It is fourteen feet high,\r\nthirty-four feet in circumference at the rim, nine inches thick\r\nand weighs 120,000 pounds. It is literally covered inside and\r\nout with Chinese characters consisting of extracts from the\r\nsacred writings, and the Rev. Dr. John Wherry, who is an\r\nexpert in the Chinese language, says that there is ``not one\r\nimperfect character among them.'' The bell when struck by\r\nthe big wooden clapper emits a deep musical note that can be\r\nheard for miles. Such a magnificent bell vividly illustrates\r\nthe stage of civilization reached by the Chinese while Europe\r\nwas comparatively barbarous, for the bell was cast as far back\r\nas 1406 in the reign of Yung-loh, and the present temple buildings\r\nwere erected about it in 1578. The Germans began using\r\npaper in 1190, but Sven Hedin found Chinese paper 1,650\r\nyears old and there is evidence that paper was in common use\r\nby the Chinese 150 years before Christ. Until a few hundred\r\nyears ago, European business was conducted on the basis of\r\ncoin or barter. But long before that, the Chinese had banks\r\nand issued bills of exchange. There has recently been placed\r\nin the British Museum a bank-note issued by Hung-Wu, Emperor\r\nof China, in 1368.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese exalt learning and, alone among the nations of\r\nthe earth, make scholarship a test of fitness for official position.\r\nTrue, that scholarship moves along narrow lines of Confucian\r\nclassics, but surely such knowledge is a higher qualification for\r\noffice than the brute strength which for centuries gave precedence\r\namong our ancestors. A Chinese writer explains as follows\r\nthe gradations in relative worth as they are esteemed by\r\nhis countrymen: ``First the scholar: because mind is superior\r\nto wealth, and it is the intellect that distinguishes man above\r\nthe lower orders of beings, and enables him to provide food\r\nand raiment and shelter for himself and for other creatures.\r\nSecond, the farmer: because the mind cannot act without the\r\nbody, and the body cannot exist without food, so that farming\r\nis essential to the existence of man, especially in civilized\r\nsociety. Third, the mechanic: because next to food, shelter\r\nis a necessity, and the man who builds a house comes next in\r\nhonour to the man who provides food. Fourth, the tradesman:\r\nbecause, as society increases and its wants are multiplied,\r\nmen to carry on exchange and barter become a necessity,\r\nand so the merchant comes into existence. His occupation\r\n--shaving both sides, the producer and consumer--tempts him\r\nto act dishonestly; hence his low grade. Fifth, the soldier\r\nstands last and lowest in the list, because his business is to\r\ndestroy and not to build up society. He consumes what others\r\nproduce, but produces nothing himself that can benefit mankind.\r\nHe is, perhaps, a necessary evil.''[11]\r\n\r\n\r\n[11] Quoted by Beach, ``Dawn on the Hills of T'ang,'' pp. 45, 46.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Government of China is a paternal despotism in\r\nform and while it is always weak and corrupt and often cruel\r\nand tyrannical in practice, nevertheless there is a larger measure\r\nof individual freedom than might be supposed. ``There are\r\nno passports, no restraints on liberty, no frontiers, no caste\r\nprejudices, no food scruples, no sanitary measures, no laws\r\nexcept popular customs and criminal statutes. China is in\r\nmany senses one vast republic, in which personal restraints\r\nhave no existence.''[12]\r\n\r\n\r\n[12] E. H Parker, ``China.''\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must not form our opinion from the Chinese whom we\r\nsee in the United States. True, most of them are kindly,\r\npatient and industrious, while some are highly intelligent.\r\nBut, with comparatively few exceptions, they are from the\r\nlower classes of a single province of Kwan-tung--Cantonese\r\ncoolies. The Chinese might as fairly form their opinion of\r\nAmericans from our day-labourers. But there are able men in\r\nthe Celestial Empire. Bishop Andrews returned from China\r\nto characterize the Chinese as ``a people of brains.'' When\r\nViceroy Li Hung Chang visited this country, all who met him\r\nunhesitatingly pronounced him a great man. The New York\r\nTribune characterizes the late Liu Kun Yi, Viceroy of Nanking,\r\nas a man who ``rendered inestimable services to China and to\r\nthe whole world,'' ``a man of action, who acted with a strong\r\nhand and masterful leadership and at the same time with a\r\njustice and a generosity that made him at once feared, respected\r\nand loved.''\r\n\r\nAfter General Grant's tour around the world, he told Senator\r\nStewart that the most astonishing thing which he had seen was\r\nthat wherever the Chinese had come into competition with the\r\nJew, the Chinese had driven out the Jew. We know the\r\npersistence of the Jew, that he has held his own against every\r\nother people. Despite the fact that he has no home and no\r\nGovernment, that he has been ridiculed and persecuted by all\r\nmen, that everywhere he is an alien in race, country and\r\nreligion, he has laboured on, patiently, resolutely, distancing\r\nevery rival, surmounting every obstacle, compelling even his\r\nenemies to acknowledge his shrewdness and his determination\r\ntill to-day in Russia, in Austria, in Germany, in England, the\r\nJew is bitterly conceded to be master in the editorial chair, at\r\nthe bar, in the universities, in the counting-house and in the\r\nbanking office; while the proudest of monarchs will undertake\r\nno enterprise requiring large expenditure until he is assured of\r\nthe support of the keen-eyed, swarthy-visaged men who control\r\nthe sinews of war. Generations of exclusion from agriculture\r\nand the mechanical arts and of devotion to commerce, have\r\ndeveloped and inbred in the Jew a marvellous facility for trade.\r\n\r\nAnd yet this race, which has so abundantly demonstrated its\r\nability to cope with the Greek, the Slav and the Teuton, finds\r\nitself outreached in cunning, outworn in persistence and over-\r\nmatched in strength by an olive-complexioned, almond-eyed\r\nfellow with felt shoes, baggy trousers, loose tunic, round cap\r\nand swishing queue, who represents such swarming myriads\r\nthat the mind is confused in the attempt to comprehend the\r\nenormous number. The canny Scotchman and the shrewd\r\nYankee are alike discomfited by the Chinese. Those who do\r\nnot believe it should ask the American and European traders\r\nwho are being crowded out of Saigon, Shanghai, Bangkok,\r\nSingapore, Penang, Batavia and Manila. In many of the ports\r\nof Asia outside of China, the Chinese have shown themselves\r\nto be successful colonizers, able to meet competition, so that\r\nto-day they own the most valuable property and control the\r\nbulk of the trade. It is true that the Chinese are inordinately\r\nconceited; but shades of the Fourth of July orator, screams of\r\nthe American eagle! it requires considerable self-possession in\r\na Yankee to criticize any one else on the planet for conceit.\r\nThe Chinese have not, at least, padded a census to make the\r\nworld believe that they are greater than they really are. In\r\nJune, 1903, the same New York newspaper that gave the horrible\r\ndetails of the burning of a negro by an American mob\r\nwithin thirty miles of Philadelphia announced that a Chinese,\r\nChung Hui Wang, had taken the highest honours in the graduating\r\nclass at Yale University. Another New York journal, in\r\ncommenting on the fact that Chao Chu, son of the former\r\nChinese minister, Wu Ting Fang, was graduated in 1904 at\r\nthe Atlantic City High School as the valedictorian of a class of\r\nthirty-one, remarked:\r\n\r\n\r\n``At every commencement there are honours enough to go around, and\r\nthose won by the Celestial contestants will not be begrudged them. Yet\r\nit is not exactly flattering to smart American youth to realize that\r\nrepresentatives of an effete civilization after a few years' acquaintance with\r\nwestern ways can meet our home talent on its own ground and carry off\r\nthe prizes of scholarship.''\r\n\r\n\r\nA British consular official, who spent many years in China and\r\nwho speaks the language, declares that in his experience of the\r\nChinese their fidelity is extraordinary, their sense of responsibility\r\nin positions of trust very keen, and that they have a\r\nvery high standard of gratitude and honour. ``I cannot\r\nrecall a case,'' he says, ``where any Chinese friend has left\r\nme in the lurch or played me a dirty trick, and few of us\r\ncan say the same of our own colleagues and countrymen.''\r\nThe Hon. Chester Holcombe, who quotes this, adds--``The\r\nwriter, after years of experience and intimate acquaintance\r\nwith all classes of Chinese from every part of the Empire, is\r\nconvinced that the characterization of the race as thus given\r\nby those who at least are not over-friendly does it only scant\r\njustice.''[13]\r\n\r\n\r\n[13] The Outlook, February 13, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany quote against the Chinese the familiar lines--\r\n\r\n     ``----for ways that are dark\r\n     And for tricks that are vain,\r\n     The heathen Chinee is peculiar.''\r\n\r\nBut whoever reads the whole poem will see the force of the\r\nLondon Spectator's opinion that it is a ``satire of the American\r\nselfishness which is the main strength of the cry against the\r\ncheap labour of the Chinese,'' and that ``it would not be easy\r\nfor a moderately intelligent man to avoid seeing that Mr. Bret\r\nHarte wished to delineate the Chinese simply as beating the\r\nYankee at his own evil game, and to delineate the Yankee as\r\nnot at all disposed to take offense at the ``cheap labour'' of his\r\nOriental rival, until he discovered that he could not cheat the\r\ncheap labourer half so completely as the cheap labourer could\r\ncheat him.''\r\n\r\nIt is common for people to praise the Japanese and to sneer\r\nat the Chinese. All honour to the Japanese for their splendid\r\nachievements. With marvellous celerity they have adopted\r\nmany modern ideas and inventions. They are worthy of the\r\nrespect they receive. But those who have made a close study\r\nof both peoples unhesitatingly assert that the Chinese have\r\nmore solid elements of permanence and power. The Japanese\r\nhave the quickness, the enthusiasm, the intelligence of the\r\nFrench; but the Chinese unite to equal intelligence the plodding\r\npersistence of the Germans, and the old fable of the tortoise\r\nand the hare is as true of nations as it is of individuals.\r\nUnquestionably, the Chinese are the most virile race in Asia\r\n``Wherever a Chinese can get a foot of ground and a quart of\r\nwater he will make something grow.'' Colquhoun quotes\r\nRichthofen as saying that ``among the various races of\r\nmankind, the Chinese is the only one which in all climates, the\r\nhottest and the coldest, is capable of great and lasting activity.''\r\nAnd he states as his own opinion: ``She has all the elements\r\nto build up a great living force. One thing alone is wanted--\r\nthe will, the directing power. That supplied, there are to be\r\nfound in abundance in China the capacity to carry out, the\r\nbrains to plan, the hands to work.''\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nA TYPICAL PROVINCE\r\n\r\nSHANTUNG is not only one of the greatest, but it is in\r\nmany respects one of the most interesting of all the\r\nprovinces of China. Its length east and west is about\r\n543 miles and in area it is nearly as large as the whole of New\r\nEngland. The name, Shantung, signifies ``east of the mountains.''\r\nForests once existed, but tillable land has become so\r\nvaluable that trees are now comparatively few save in the\r\nvillages and temples and about the graves of the rich. But for the\r\nmost part, Shantung resembles the great prairie regions of the\r\nwestern part of the United States, broken by occasional ranges\r\nof hills and low mountains. The soil is generally fertile,\r\nthough in the southwestern part I found some stony regions\r\nwhere the soil is thin and poor. South of Chinan-fu one finds\r\nthe loess, a light friable earth which yields so easily to wheel\r\nand hoof and wind and water that the stream of travel through\r\nsuccessive generations has worn deep cuts in which the traveller\r\nmay journey for hours and sometimes for days so far below the\r\ngeneral level of the country that he can see nothing but the\r\nsides of the cut and in turn cannot be seen by others. The\r\ncharacter of the soil and the power of the wind and rain have\r\ncombined not only to excavate these long passages, but to cast\r\nup innumerable mounds and hills, often of such fantastic shapes\r\nthat one is reminded of the quaint and curious formations in\r\nthe Bad Lands of the Missouri, though the loess hillocks lack\r\nthe brilliant colouring of the American formations.\r\n\r\nThroughout the province as a whole, almost every possible\r\nsquare rod of ground is carefully cultivated by the industrious\r\npeople, so that in the summer time the whole country appears\r\nto be continuous gardens and farms dotted with innumerable\r\nvillages. Wheat appears to be the chief crop and, as in the\r\nDakotas, the entire landscape seems to be one splendid field of\r\nwaving, yellowing grain. But early in June the wheat disappears\r\nas if by magic, for the whole population apparently, men,\r\nwomen and children, turn out and harvest it with amazing\r\nquickness in spite of the fact that everything is done by hand.\r\nMen and donkeys carry the grain to smooth, hard ground\r\nspaces, where it is threshed by a heavy roller stone drawn by a\r\ndonkey or an ox or by men, and several times I saw it drawn\r\nby women. Then it is winnowed by being pitched into the\r\nair for the wind to drive out the feathery chaff. The methods\r\nvividly illustrate the first Psalm and other Bible references--\r\ngleaning, muzzling ``the ox when he treadeth out the corn,''\r\nthe threshing floor and ``the chaff which the wind driveth\r\naway.''\r\n\r\nOne might suppose that after the wheat harvest, stubble\r\nfields would be much in evidence. But they are not, for the\r\nmillet promptly appears. It is hardly noticeable when the\r\nwheat is standing. But it grows rapidly, and as soon as the\r\nwheat is out of the way, it covers great areas with its refreshing\r\ngreen, looking in its earlier stages like young corn. It is of\r\ntwo varieties. One is a little higher than wheat, with hanging\r\nhead and a small yellow grain. The other is the kao-liang,\r\nwhich grows to a height of about twelve feet. When small, it\r\nis thinned out to one stalk or sometimes two in a hill so that it\r\ncan develop freely. This stalk is to the common people almost\r\nas serviceable as the bamboo to tropical dwellers. It is used\r\nfor fences, ceilings, walls and many other purposes. The grain\r\nof the two varieties is the staple food, few but the richer\r\nclasses eating rice which is not raised in the north and is high\r\nin price. A third species of millet, shu-shu, is used chiefly\r\nfor distilling a whiskey that is largely used but almost always\r\nat home and at night so that little drunkenness is seen by the\r\ntraveller.\r\n\r\nFuel is very scarce, trees being few and coal, though\r\nabundant, not being mined to any extent. So the people cook\r\nwith stalks, straw, roots, etc., and in winter pile on additional\r\nlayers of wadded cotton garments. Chinese houses are not\r\nheated as ours are, though the flues from the cooking fire, running\r\nunder the brick kang, give some heat, too much at times.\r\n\r\nSilk is produced in large quantities and mulberry trees are\r\nso common as to add greatly to the beauty of the country. As\r\nthe cocoons cannot be left on the trees for fear of thieves, the\r\nleaves are picked off and taken into houses where the worms\r\nare kept.\r\n\r\nPoppy fields, too, are numerous. The flowers are gloriously\r\nbeautiful. I often saw men gathering the opium in the early\r\nmorning. After the blossoms fall off, the pod is slit and the\r\nwhitish juice, oozing out, is carefully scraped off. High hills\r\nrising to low mountains add beauty to the western part of Shantung,\r\nwhile the more numerous trees scattered over the fields as\r\nwell as in the villages make extensive regions look like vast\r\nparks.\r\n\r\nThe people are among the finest types of the Chinese,\r\ntall, strong and, in many instances, of marked intellectual\r\npower. To the Chinese, Shantung is the most sacred of the\r\nprovinces, for here were born the two mighty sages, Confucius\r\nand Mencius.\r\n\r\nPolitically, the Province is divided into ten prefectures, each\r\nunder a prefectural magistrate, called a Chih-fu, and with a\r\ncapital which has the termination ``fu.'' I-chou-fu, for example,\r\nis a prefectural city. Each fu is subdivided into ten districts\r\nunder a district magistrate or Chih-hsien, the capital, or\r\ncounty seat as we should call it, having the termination ``hsien''\r\nor ``hien'' as for example Wei-hsien. There are 108 of these\r\nhsien cities. Between the fu and the hsien cities are a few chou\r\ncities as Chining-chou. They are practically small fus, Chining-\r\nchou having four hsiens under it. The magistrate is called a Chou-\r\nkwan and is responsible directly to a Tao-tai who is an official\r\nbetween the prefectural magistrate or Chih-fu and the Governor.\r\nThere are three Tao-tais in the province. At the\r\nprovincial capital are the treasurer or Fan-tai, the Nieh-tai or\r\njudge, the Hueh-tai or commissioner of education and the salt\r\ncommissioner, Yen-yuen. These are all high officials. Over\r\nall is the Governor, virtually a monarch subject only to the\r\nnominal supervision of the Imperial Government at Peking.\r\nHe is appointed and may at any time be removed by the\r\nEmperor, but during his tenure of office he has almost unlimited\r\npower.\r\n\r\nMy tour of China included two interesting months in this\r\ngreat province. As I approached Chefoo on the steamer from\r\nKorea, I was impressed by the beauty of the scene. The water\r\nwas smooth and sparkling in the bright spring sunshine. The\r\nharbour is exceptionally lovely. The shore lines are irregular,\r\nterminating in a high promonotory on which are situated the\r\nbuildings of the various consulates. To the right, as the\r\ntraveller faces the city, is the business section with its wharves\r\nand well-constructed commercial buildings, while on the left is\r\nthe wide curve of a fine beach on which front the foreign hotel\r\nand the handsome buildings of the China Inland Mission.\r\nBeyond the city, rises a noble hill on the slopes of which stand\r\nthe buildings of the Presbyterian Mission. From the water,\r\nChefoo is one of the most charming cities in all China.\r\n\r\nBig, lusty Chinese in their wide, clumsy boats called sampans,\r\nswarmed in the harbour. Sculling alongside, the boatman\r\ncaught the rail of the steamer with his boat-hook and with\r\nthe agility of a monkey scrambled up the long pole, dropped it\r\ninto the water and began to hustle for business. The babel of\r\nvoices bidding for passengers was like the tumult of Niagara\r\nhack-drivers, but we were so fortunate as to be met by Dr. W.\r\nF. Faries and the Rev. W. O. Elterich of the Presbyterian\r\nMission and under their skillful guidance, we were soon taken\r\nashore.\r\n\r\nA closer view of the Chinese city proved less attractive than\r\nthe captivating one from the harbour. The population long\r\nago over-ran the limits of the old city so that to-day most of\r\nthe people are outside the walls. Within those ancient battlements,\r\nthe streets are narrow and crooked, while the filth is\r\nindescribable. The visitor who wishes to see something of the\r\nwork and to enjoy the hospitality of the noble company of\r\nPresbyterian missionaries on Temple Hill must either pass through\r\nthat reeking mess or go around it. There is, after all, not\r\nmuch choice in the routes, for the Chinese population outside\r\nthe walls has simply squatted there without much order, and\r\nthe corkscrew streets are not only thronged with people and\r\ndonkeys and mules, but malodorous with ditches through which\r\nall the nastiness of the crowded habitations trickles. Why\r\npestilence does not carry off the whole population is a mystery\r\nto the visitor from the West, especially as he sees the pools out\r\nof which the people drink, their shores lined with washerwomen\r\nand the water dark and thick with the dirt of decades. Byron's\r\nwords in ``Childe Harold'' are as true of Chefoo as of Lisbon:\r\n\r\n ``But whoso entereth within this town,\r\n   That, sheening far, a celestial seems to be,\r\n Disconsolate will wander up and down\r\n   'Mid many things unsightly to strange e'e;\r\n For hut and palace show like filthily.\r\n   The dingy denizens are reared in dirt,\r\n No personage of high or mean degree\r\n Doth care for cleanness of surtout, or shirt,\r\n   Though shent with Egypt's plague, unkempt, unwashed, unhurt!''\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first open port of Shantung was Teng-chou-fu, a quaint\r\nold city on the far northeastern point of the Shantung promontory.\r\nIt has been outstripped in importance by its later\r\nrival, Chefoo, and is now ignored by the through steamers and\r\nseldom visited by travellers. As the trip from Chefoo by land\r\nrequires two long hard days over a mountain range and as time\r\nwas precious, I decided to go by water. The regular coasting\r\nsteamer was not running on account of danger from pirates,\r\nwho had been unusually bold and murderous in attacking passing\r\nvessels. But I succeeded in hiring a small launch. It was\r\na trip of fifty-five miles along the coast on the open sea, but the\r\nweather was good and so we risked it. Several of the missionaries\r\ntook advantage of the occasion to visit friends in Tengchou-fu\r\nso that a pleasant little party was formed.\r\n\r\nWe had intended to start at 7:30 A. M., but some of our luggage\r\nand chair coolies, who had been engaged to take us from\r\nTemple Hill to the launch at 6:30, did not come, and we had\r\nto press into service some untrained ``boys.'' Then, our chair\r\ncoolies, who had been carefully instructed as to their destination\r\nand who had solemnly asserted that they knew just where to go,\r\ngot separated from the others and calmly took us to the Union\r\nChurch. We appreciated their apparent conviction that we\r\nneeded to go to church, but we vainly tried to make them\r\nunderstand that we wanted to go somewhere else. The delay\r\nwould have become exasperating if a small English boy who\r\nknew Chinese had not helped us out. Then the two coolies\r\nwho were carrying our valises and the lunch-baskets went\r\nanother way and sat down en route ``to rest.'' They would\r\ndoubtless be sitting there yet if, after waiting till our patience\r\nwas exhausted, we had not sent men to find them. But that is\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\nHowever, all arrived at last and at 8:20 A. M. we cast off.\r\nThe day was glorious and as the sea was not rough enough to\r\nmake any one ill, we had a delightful trip along the coast with\r\nits bare, brown hills so much resembling the scenery of California.\r\nWe reached Teng-chou-fu at 3:15 and that the pirates\r\nwere not imaginary was evident for as we entered the harbour,\r\nthey made a dash and captured a junk less than a mile away.\r\nAn alarm cannon was fired and soldiers were running to the\r\nbeach as we landed.\r\n\r\nWhile in Teng-chou-fu, we witnessed a pathetic ceremony.\r\nThere had been no rain for several weeks. The kao-liang was\r\nwithering and the farmers could not plant their beans on the\r\nground from which the winter wheat had been cut. The people\r\nhad become alarmed as the drought continued, and they\r\nwere parading the streets bearing banners, wearing chaplets of\r\nwithered leaves on their heads to remind the gods that the\r\nvegetation was dying, beating drums to attract the attention of\r\nthe god, and ever and anon falling on their knees and praying\r\n--``O Great Dragon! send us rain.'' It was pitiful. This\r\ncountry is fertile but the population is so enormous that, in the\r\nabsence of any manufacturing or mining, the people even in the\r\nmost favoured seasons live from hand to mouth, and a drought\r\nmeans the starvation of multitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nA SHENDZA IN SHANTUNG\r\n\r\nTHE spring of 1901 was not the most propitious time\r\nfor a tour of the province of Shantung. It was\r\nshortly after the suppression of the Boxer outbreak\r\nand the country was still in an unsettled condition. The\r\nveteran Dr. Hunter Corbett, who had resided in the province\r\nfor a generation said, ``We are living on a volcano and we do\r\nnot know at what moment another eruption will occur.''\r\nStudents returning from the examinations at the capitol told the\r\npeople that the Boxers were to rise again and kill all the foreigners\r\nand Chinese Christians. The missionaries did not believe\r\nthe report, but they said that it might be believed by the\r\npeople and cause a renewal of agitation as such rumours the\r\nyear before had been an important factor in inciting the populace\r\nto violence. But the interior of this great province was\r\none of the objective points of my tour and I could not miss it.\r\nBesides, if the missionaries could go, I could. Wives, however,\r\nwere resolutely debarred. No woman had yet ventured\r\ninto the interior and the authorities refused to approve their\r\ngoing. In case of trouble, a man can fight or run, but a\r\nwoman is peculiarly helpless. Nor could we forget that the\r\nChinese during the Boxer outbreak treated foreign women who\r\nfell into their hands with horrible atrocity. So the wives, rather\r\nagainst their will, remained in the ports.\r\n\r\nArrangements are apt to move slowly in this land of deliberation.\r\nThe genial and efficient United States Consul at Chefoo,\r\nthe Hon. John Fowler, joked me a little about my hurry to\r\nstart, laughingly remarking that this was Asia and not New\r\nYork, and that I must not expect things to be done on the\r\ntouch of a button as at home. But finding that a German\r\nsteamer was to leave the next day for Tsing-tau, the starting\r\npoint for the interior, the energetic missionaries helped me to\r\n``hustle the East'' to get off on it. The Chinese tailor gasped\r\nwhen I told him that I must have a khaki suit by six the following\r\nevening, but when he learned that I was to sail and\r\ntherefore could not wait, he promised rather than lose the job.\r\nThe next day the steamer agent notified me that the sailing\r\nhour had been changed to four o'clock. I sent word to the\r\ntailor with faint hope of ever seeing that suit, and when a later\r\nmessage gave three o'clock as the real time, I abandoned hope.\r\nBut the enterprising Celestial made his fingers fly, finished the\r\nsuit by 2:50 P. M., and took it to the house of my hostess.\r\nFinding that I had already gone to the steamer, he hurried off\r\nto the wharf, hired a sampan, sculled a mile and panting but\r\ntriumphant placed the suit in my hands just as the steamer was\r\ngetting under way. His charge for the suit, including all his\r\ntrouble and the cost of the sampan, was $7 Mexican ($3.50).\r\n\r\nSaturday found me in Tsing-tau, and Monday, I turned my\r\nface inland, accompanied by the Rev. J. H. Laughlin and Dr.\r\nCharles H. Lyon, and, as far as Wei-hsien, by the Rev. Frank\r\nChalfant, all of the Presbyterian mission, besides Mr. William\r\nShipway of the English Baptist mission, who was to accompany\r\nus as far as Ching-chou-fu. To-day, the traveller can journey\r\nto Chinan-fu, the capital, in a comfortable railway\r\ncar, but I shall always be glad that my visit occurred in the old\r\ndays when the native methods of transportation were the sole\r\ndependence, for at that time the new German railway was in\r\noperation only forty-six miles to the old city of Kiao-chou.\r\n\r\nThe modes of conveyance in the interior of China are five--\r\nthe donkey, the sedan chair, the wheelbarrow, the cart and the\r\nshendza (mule litter), and naturally the first problem of the\r\ntraveller is to decide which one he shall adopt.\r\n\r\nThe donkey is all right to one accustomed to horseback\r\nriding. But there is no protection from the sun and rain and\r\nforeign saddles are scarce. The traveller piles his bedding\r\non the animal's back and climbs on top, sitting either astride\r\nor sideways. In either case, the feet dangle unsupported by\r\nstirrups. It is hard to make long trips in this way, to say\r\nnothing of the consideration that a man feels like an idiot in\r\nsuch circumstances. ``The outside of a horse is indeed good\r\nfor the inside of a man,'' but a mattress on top of a donkey is\r\na different matter.\r\n\r\nThe chair is comfortable for short distances, but it is comparatively\r\nexpensive and, as no change of position is possible,\r\none soon becomes tired sitting in the fixed attitude. In pity to\r\nyour coolies, you walk up-hill and you are exposed to inclement\r\nweather unless you hire a covered chair. This, however,\r\nis not only hot and stuffy, but it makes people think you an\r\naristocrat, as only officials or the rich use such chairs in the\r\ncountry, though in cities they are a common means of conveyance.\r\nBesides, I had travelled in a chair in Korea and I\r\nwished to try something else in China.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese wheelbarrow is a clumsy affair with a narrow\r\nseat on each side of a central partition. When large and with\r\nan awning, it is not so uncomfortable, but it is not well adapted\r\nto a long journey as it is slow and toilsome. When the mud is\r\ndeep, progress is almost impossible. Moreover, the labour of\r\nthe barrow-men constantly excites the sympathy of the humane\r\ntraveller and the dismal screech of the wheel revolving upon\r\nits unoiled axle is worse than the rasp of filing a saw. The\r\nChinese depend upon the shrieks of the wheel to tell them how\r\nthe axle is wearing, but the disconsolate foreigner finds that his\r\nnerves wear out much faster than the wooden axle. In Tsing-\r\ntau, that agonizing screech proved too much even for the stolid\r\nGermans and they posted an ordinance to the effect that all\r\nbarrow axles must be greased. The Chinese demurred, but a\r\nfew arrests taught them obedience, so that now the streets of\r\nthe German metropolis no longer resound with the hysterical\r\nwails and moans so dear to the heart of the Celestial.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese cart is a curious affair. There are no roads in\r\nthe interior of China, except the ruts that have been made by\r\nthe passing of many feet and wheels for generations. In dry\r\nweather, they are thick with dust and in the wet season they\r\nare fathomless with mud. Almost everywhere they are distractingly\r\ncrooked, and in many places they are plentifully bestrewn\r\nwith boulders of varying sizes. Instead of spending\r\nmoney in making roads, the Chinese have applied their ingenuity\r\nto making an indestructible cart. They build it of heavy\r\ntimbers, with massive wheels, thick spokes and ponderous hubs,\r\nand as no springs could survive the jolting of such a vehicle,\r\nthe body of the cart is placed directly upon the huge axle.\r\nThen a couple of big mules are hitched up tandem and driven\r\nat breakneck speed. A runaway in an American farmer's\r\nwagon over a corduroy road but feebly suggests the miseries of\r\ntravel in a Chinese cart. It may be good for a dyspeptic, but\r\nit is about the most uncomfortable conveyance that the ingenuity\r\nof man has yet devised. The unhappy passenger is\r\nhurled against the wooden top and sides and is so jolted and\r\nbumped that, as the small boy said in his composition, ``his\r\nheart, lungs, liver, kidneys, stomach, bones and brains are all\r\nmixed up.'' I tried the cart for a while and gently but firmly\r\nintimated that if nothing better was available, I would walk. I\r\nam satisfied that nothing short of a modern battleship under\r\nfull steam could make the slightest impression on the typical\r\nChinese cart. In my humble opinion, a Chinese cart is like\r\nany other misfortune in life. When necessary, it should be\r\ntaken uncomplainingly. But the person who takes it unnecessarily\r\nhas not reached the years of discretion and should be\r\nassigned a guardian.\r\n\r\nI therefore turned to the shendza. All things considered, it\r\nis the best conveyance for a long interior journey in China.\r\nIt consists of a couple long poles with a rope basket work in the\r\nmiddle and a cover of matting. It is borne by two mules, and\r\nhas the advantage of protecting the traveller from the sun and\r\nfrom light rains. An opening in the back gives him the benefit\r\nof any breeze while it is possible to get occasional relief by\r\nchanging position, as he can either sit upright or lounge.\r\nMoreover, he can keep his bedding and a little food with him.\r\nHe need not walk up hills in mercy to weary coolies and he\r\ncan make the longer daily journeys which the superior endurance\r\nof mules permits. In ordinary conditions on level ground,\r\nmy mules averaged about four miles an hour. The motion is a\r\nkind of sieve-and-pepper-box shaking that is not so bad,\r\nprovided the mules behave themselves, which is not often.\r\nMy rear mule had a meek and quiet spirit. He was a discouraged\r\nanimal upon which the sorrows of life had told\r\nheavily and which had reached that age when he appeared to\r\nhave no ambition in life except to stop and think or to lie down\r\nand rest. The lead mule, however, was a cantankerous beast\r\nthat wanted to fight everything within reach and went into\r\nhysterics every time any other animal passed him. As this occurred\r\na score of times a day, the uncertainties of the situation\r\nwere interesting, especially when the rear mule paused or\r\nlaid down without having previously notified the lead mule.\r\nAt such times, the sudden stoppage of the power behind and\r\nthe plunging of the power in front threatened the dislocation\r\nof the entire apparatus, and as there is no way for the traveller\r\nto get out except over the heels of a mule, life in a shendza is\r\nnot always uneventful. But I soon got used to the motion and\r\nto the mules, and even learned to read and to doze in comparative\r\ncomfort while the long-eared animals plodded and\r\njerked on in their own way.\r\n\r\nThe most trying thing to the humane traveller is the soreness\r\nof the mules' backs. I insisted on having mules whose\r\nbacks were sound, but was told by both missionaries and\r\nChinese that they could not be had, especially in summer, as\r\nthe swaying and jerking of the shendza and the sweat and\r\ndust under the heavy pack-saddle always make sores. It was\r\nall too true. I examined scores of mules and every one had\r\nraw and bleeding abrasions and, in some cases, suppurating\r\nulcers. For a Chinese, our head muleteer was careful of his\r\nanimals and washed them occasionally, but no practicable care\r\napparently can prevent a shendza from making a sore back.\r\nThe only solace I had was the evident indifference of the\r\nmules themselves. They had never known anything better,\r\nand seemed to take misery as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nOur party, with the goods we had to carry, for my missionary\r\nfriends were returning to their stations with the expectation\r\nof remaining, included three shendzas, two carts and a\r\npack-mule for our provisions. But the ``mule'' turned out to\r\nbe a donkey and unable to carry all we had planned for a larger\r\nanimal. While wondering how we were to get our supplies\r\ncarried, we learned that a construction train was about to start\r\nfor the end of the track, which was said to be Kaomi, fifty-\r\nfive li[14] beyond Kiao-chou. We got permission to ride on the\r\nflat car. In the hope that we might be able to secure a mule or\r\nanother donkey in Kaomi, we got aboard, leaving our shendzas\r\nand carts to follow. After a lovely ride of an hour through\r\nwheat-fields interspersed with villages, our train stopped twelve\r\nli from Kaomi, an unfinished culvert making further progress\r\nimpossible. As our caravan had gone by a different route and\r\nas no coolies could be hired where we were, the question was\r\nhow to get our goods transported. Fortunately, a German\r\nRoman Catholic priest, who was also on the construction\r\ntrain and who had wheelbarrows for his own goods, cordially\r\ntold us to pile our luggage on top of his. We gratefully accepted\r\nthis kind offer, and giving his coolies some extra cash\r\nfor their labour, they good-naturedly accepted the additional\r\nburden, while we footed the twelve li to Kaomi.\r\n\r\n\r\n[14] A li is about a third of a mile.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the progress of the barrows was slow and it was half-\r\npast eight when we reached Kaomi. In the darkness we could\r\nnot find the inn which the magistrate had set aside for foreigners\r\nand the Chinese whom we met gave conflicting replies.\r\nBut at that moment, two resident Roman Catholic priests,\r\nAustrians, appeared and one of them recognized Mr. Laughlin\r\nas the associate of Dr. Van Schoick, a Presbyterian medical\r\nmissionary who had sympathetically treated a fellow priest during\r\na long and dangerous illness several years before. He\r\npromptly invited us to go with him, declaring that Dr. Van\r\nSchoick had saved the life of his dearest friend. He was\r\nso cordially insistent that we accepted his invitation. Our\r\nshendzas, carts and pack-mule were we knew not where, and\r\nwe were hungry after our long day. Warned by my experience\r\nin Korea that the traveller should never trust to the\r\npunctuality of natives and pack-animals, I had insisted on\r\ntaking our bedding and a little food on the flat car. It was\r\nwell that I did, for we did not see our shendzas that night as\r\nthey arrived after the city gates had been shut so that they\r\ncould not get in. But we had a little cocoa, tinned corn beef,\r\ncondensed milk, butter and marmalade. Same German soldiers\r\nsent three loaves of coarse bread. Our priestly host added\r\nsome Chinese bread, and so had a good supper and afterwards\r\na sound sleep.\r\n\r\nAt half-past four the next morning, Mr. Laughlin remarked\r\nin a forty-horse power tone of voice that it was time to get up.\r\nBy the time the reverberations had died away, we were so wide\r\nawake that further sleep was out of the question. Our cook\r\nwas nowhere in sight, so we prepared our own breakfast from\r\nthe remains of last night's meal.\r\n\r\nBidding a grateful farewell to our hospitable priests, we rode\r\nacross an ancient lake bottom, low, flat, wheat-covered and hot\r\nenough to broil meat. At half-past ten o'clock, we reached\r\nFau-chia-chiu, the boundary of the hinterland, where, near a\r\ntemple just outside the wall, we found Governor Yuan Shih\r\nKai's military escort awaiting us. It was after sundown when\r\nwe reached Liu-chia-chuang, and we felt half inclined to spend\r\nthe night there with some genial German military engineers,\r\nbut our party had become separated during the day and as\r\nthe others had taken a road that did not pass through Liu-\r\nchia-chuang, we pushed on to Hsi-an-tai, which we reached by\r\na little after ten o'clock. By that time, it was so dark that it\r\nwas impossible to go further and we found lodgment in a good-\r\nsized building which smelled to heaven. The odour was like\r\nthat of a decomposing body. However, it was too late and we\r\nwere too weary either to hunt up smells or to seek another lodging\r\nplace. So after a hasty supper out of our tinned food, we\r\nput up our cots and went to bed, Mr. Chalfant making a few\r\npleasant remarks about the bedbugs that always swarm in such\r\na building, the centipedes that sometimes crawl into the ears or\r\nnostrils of sleepers and the scorpions that occasionally fall from\r\nthe millet-stalk ceiling on to the bed or scuttle across the floor\r\nto bite the person who unwarily walks in his bare feet. Under\r\nthe influence of such a soporific, I soon fell asleep. The next\r\nmorning we rose early, and while the cook was preparing our\r\ncoffee and eggs, we followed the trail of that awful odour to a\r\ncorner of the building, where, under some millet stalks, we\r\nfound a rude coffin which we had not noticed in the dim candlelight\r\nof the night before. A Chinese of whom we inquired\r\nsaid that it was empty. We could not in courtesy open a\r\ncoffin before dozens of interested Chinese, but it was very\r\nplain to our olfactories that such an odour required a prompt\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\nAs usual, a great but silent crowd watched me as I wrote\r\nwhile the mules were being fed and at Hsien-chung, where\r\nwe stopped at noon to repair a shendza, Mr. Chalfant translated\r\na proclamation on a wall stating that an indemnity of\r\n110,000 taels had to be paid for damage to the railway during\r\nthe Boxer outbreak and that 14,773 taels had been assessed on\r\nWei County. The people read it with scowling faces, but they\r\nsaid nothing to us, though they looked as if they wanted to.\r\n\r\nAt two o'clock, we entered the ruined Presbyterian compound,\r\na mile southeast of the city of Wei-hsien. It was\r\nthrilling to hear on the scene of the riot Mr. Chalfant's\r\naccount of the attack by about a thousand furious Boxers;\r\nto see the place just outside the gate where single-handed and\r\nwith no weapon but a small revolver, he had heroically held\r\nthe mob at bay for several hours until the swarming Boxers,\r\nawed by his splendid courage, divided, and while several\r\nhundred held his attention, the rest climbed over the wall at\r\nanother place and fired the mission buildings. That the three\r\nmissionaries escaped with their lives is a wonder. But Mr.\r\nChalfant quickly ran to the house where Miss Hawes and Miss\r\nBoughton were awaiting him, hurried them down-stairs,\r\nand while the Boxers were smashing the furniture on the other\r\nside of a closed door, snatched up a ladder, assisted them over\r\nthe compound wall at a point that was providentially unguarded\r\nand hid them in a field of grain until darkness\r\nenabled them to make their way exhausted but unhurt to a camp\r\nof German soldiers and engineers nine miles distant and to\r\nescape with them to Tsing-tau. It was a remarkable experience.\r\nIf that door had not happened to be closed, and if\r\na ladder had not been carelessly left by a servant beside the\r\nhouse, and if the attack itself had not occurred just before\r\ndark, undoubtedly all three would have been killed. On each\r\nof those three ifs, lives depended.\r\n\r\nMr. Fitch cordially welcomed us. Mr. Chalfant killed a\r\ncentipede and various insects crawling on the walls near my\r\ncot and a little after nine I was asleep. The next day we\r\ntook a walk through the city, impressed by its imposing wall\r\nand the throngs of people who followed us and watched every\r\nmovement. Outside the wall, we saw a ``baby house,'' a\r\nsmall stone building in which the dead children of the poor\r\nare thrown to be eaten by dogs! I wanted to examine it, but\r\nwas warned not to do so, as the Chinese imagine that\r\nforeigners make their medicine out of children's eyes and\r\nbrains, and our crowds of watching Chinese might quickly become\r\nan infuriated mob.\r\n\r\nImmediately on our arrival, we had sent our cards to the\r\ndistrict magistrate and in the afternoon he sent us an elaborate\r\nfeast. As we were about to retire that evening, he called in a\r\ngorgeous chair with a retinue of twenty attendants. He stayed\r\nhalf an hour and was very cordial, and we had a pleasant interview.\r\nWei-hsien is famous for its embroideries, and great\r\nquantities are made, the women workers receiving about fifty\r\nsmall cash a day (less than two cents). It was not necessary\r\nto go to the stores as in America. The shopkeepers brought a\r\ngreat number of pieces to our inn, covering the kang and every\r\navailable table, chair and box with exquisite bits of handiwork.\r\nLured by the sight I became reckless and bought four\r\nhandsome pieces for 19,800 small cash ($6.06).\r\n\r\nResuming our journey on a warm, sunny day, we entered\r\nChiang-loa at noon. It was market day, and the greatest\r\ncrowd yet fairly blocked the streets. The soldiers had difficulty\r\nin clearing a way for us. But while much curiosity\r\nwas expressed, there was no sign of hostility. Then we\r\njourneyed on through the interminable fields of ripening wheat.\r\nSoon, mountains, which we had dimly seen for several hours,\r\ngrew more distinct and as we approached Ching-chou-fu towards\r\nevening, the scene was one of great beauty--the yellowing\r\ngrain gently undulating in the soft breeze, the mountains\r\nnot really more than 3,000 feet in height, but from our stand\r\non the plain looking lofty, massive and delightfully refreshing\r\nto the eye after our hot and dusty journeying. The city has a\r\npopulation of about 25,000 and its numerous trees look so invitingly\r\ngreen that the traveller is eager to enter.\r\n\r\nBut in this case also, distance lent enchantment, for within,\r\nwhile there was not the filth of a Korean village, yet the narrow\r\nstreets were far from clean. Not a blade of grass relieved the\r\nbare, dusty ground trampled by many feet, while the low, mud-\r\nplastered houses were not inviting. A Chinese seldom thinks\r\nof making repairs. He builds once, usually with rough stone\r\nplastered with mud or with sun-dried brick. The roof is\r\nthatched and the floor is the beaten earth, although in the\r\nbetter houses it is stone or brick. In time, the mud-plaster\r\nor, if the walls are of sun-dried brick, the wall itself begins to\r\ndisintegrate. But it is let alone, as long as it does not make\r\nthe house uninhabitable, while paint is unknown. So the general\r\nappearance of a Chinese town is squalid and tumbledown.\r\nEven the yamen of a district magistrate presents\r\ncrumbling walls, unkempt courtyards, rickety buildings and\r\npaper-covered windows full of holes. The palaces of the rich\r\nare often expensive, but the Asiatic has little of our ideas of\r\ncomfort and order.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. J. P. Bruce and Mr. R. C. Forsyth, of the English\r\nBaptist mission, the only members of the station who were\r\npresent, gave us a hearty welcome. The green shrubbery,\r\nthe bath-tub, the dinner of roast beef and the clean bedroom,\r\nwere like a bit of hospitable old England set down in China.\r\nNone of the buildings here were injured by the Boxers. But\r\nthe marauders took whatever they could use, as dishes, utensils,\r\nglass, linen, clothes, silver and plated ware, jewelry, etc., the\r\ntotal loss being <Pd>4,000, including <Pd>1,000 for machinery.\r\nThat machinery has an interesting history. One of the members\r\nof the mission, Mr. A. G. Jones, conceived the idea of\r\nrelieving the poverty of the Chinese by introducing cotton\r\nweaving. Having some private means and being a mechanical\r\ngenius, he spent two years and <Pd>1,000 in devising the\r\nnecessary machinery, much of which he made himself. He\r\nhad completed the plant and was trying to induce the Chinese\r\nto organize a company of Christians who would operate the\r\nfactory, when the building was burned by the Boxers and the\r\nmachinery reduced to a heap of twisted scrap-iron.\r\n\r\nThe women we met in these interior districts had only\r\npartially bound feet, though they were still far from the natural\r\nsize. It was surprising to see how freely the women walked,\r\nespecially as several that I saw were carrying babies. But it\r\nwas rather a stumpy walk. Women of the higher class have\r\nsmaller feet and never walk in the public streets.\r\n\r\nWe left Ching-chou-fu Monday morning, our genial hosts,\r\nincluding Mr. Shipway, who remained here, accompanying us\r\na couple of miles. The trees were more numerous, and as the\r\nweather was cool, I greatly enjoyed the day. But the next\r\nday, we plodded under dripping skies and through sticky mud\r\nto Chang-tien, where a night of unusual discomfort in an inn\r\nliterally alive with fleas and mosquitoes prepared us to enjoy a\r\ntiffin with a lonely English Baptist outpost, the genial Rev.\r\nWilliam A. Wills, at Chou-tsun, which we reached at noon\r\nthe following day, and then, thirty li further on, the gracious\r\nhospitality of the main station at Chou-ping. Only three men\r\nwere present of the regular station force of seven families and\r\ntwo single women, but they gave us all the more abundant\r\nwelcome in their isolation and loneliness. Of the 2,577\r\nChinese Christians of this station, 132 were murdered by the\r\nBoxers and seventy or more died from consequent exposure and\r\ninjuries.\r\n\r\nA vast, low lying plain begins forty li north of Chou-ping\r\nand extends northeastward as far as Tien-tsin. This plain is subject\r\nto destructive inundations from the Yellow River and the\r\nscenes of ruin and suffering are sometimes appalling. Our unattractive\r\ninn the next night was a two-story brick building\r\nwith iron doors, stone floors, walls two and a-half feet thick and\r\nrooms dark, gloomy, ill-smelling as a dungeon and of course\r\nswarming with vermin, as savage bites promptly testified. My\r\nmissionary companion said that it was probably an old pawnshop.\r\nPawnbroking is esteemed an honourable, as well as\r\nlucrative, business in China, and the brokers are influential\r\nmen and often have considerable property in their shops. The\r\npeople are so poor that they sometimes pawn their winter clothes\r\nin summer and their summer ones in winter.\r\n\r\nAt noon the next day, we reached Chinan-fu, having made\r\nseventy li in six hours over muddy roads. Dr. James B. Neal\r\nof the Presbyterian mission was alone in the city and gave us\r\nhospitable welcome to his home and to the splendid missionary\r\nwork of the station, though he rather suggestively stopped our\r\ncoolies when they were about to carry our bedding into the\r\nhouse. He was wise, too, for that bedding had been used in\r\ntoo many native inns to be prudently admitted to a well-\r\nordered household.\r\n\r\nAs we walked through the city, the narrow streets were\r\nliterally jammed, for it was market day. Foreigners had been\r\nscarce since the Boxer outbreak a year before. Besides, many\r\nof the people were from the country where foreigners are\r\nseldom seen anyway. So we made as great a sensation as a\r\ncircus in an American city. A multitude followed us, and\r\nwherever we stopped hundreds packed the narrow streets.\r\nOur soldiers cleared the way, but they had no difficulty, for\r\nthough the people were inquisitive they were not hostile.\r\nThree magnificent springs burst forth in the heart of the city,\r\none as large as the famous spring in Roanoke, Virginia, which\r\nsupplies all that city with water. It was about a hundred feet\r\nacross. The water might easily be piped all over Chinan-fu.\r\nBut this is China, and so the people patiently walk to the\r\nsprings for their daily supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nAT THE GRAVE OF CONFUCIUS\r\n\r\nWE were now approaching the most sacred places of\r\nChina. On a hot July afternoon of the second day\r\nfrom Chinan-fu, the capital of the province, we saw\r\nthe noble proportions of Tai-shan, the holy mountain. The\r\nChinese have five sacred mountains, but this is the most venerated\r\nof all. Its altitude is not great, only a little over 4,000\r\nfeet, but it rises so directly from the plain and its outlines are\r\nso majestic that it is really imposing. To the Chinese its\r\nheight is awe-inspiring, for in all the eighteen provinces there\r\nis no loftier peak.\r\n\r\nStopping for the night at the ancient city of Tai-an-fu at the\r\nbase of the mountain, we set out at six the next morning in\r\nchairs swung between poles borne by stalwart coolies. My\r\ncuriosity was aroused when I found that they were Mohammedans\r\nand, as they cordially responded to my questionings, I\r\nfound them very interesting. Centuries ago, their ancestors\r\ncame to China as mercenaries, and taking Chinese wives settled\r\nin the country. But they have never intermarried since.\r\nThey have adopted the dress and language of the Chinese, but\r\notherwise they continue almost as distinct as the Jews in\r\nAmerica. They instruct their children in the doctrines of\r\nIslam, though the Mohammedan rule that the Koran must not\r\nbe translated has prevented all but a few literati from obtaining\r\nany knowledge of the book itself. They have done little\r\nproselyting, but natural increase, occasional reenforcements\r\nand the adoption of famine children have gradually swelled\r\ntheir ranks until they now number many millions in various\r\nparts of China. In some provinces they are very strong, particularly\r\nin Yun-nan and Kan-su where they are said to form a\r\nmajority of the population. They are notorious for turbulence\r\nand are popularly known as ``Mohammedan thieves.'' It\r\nmust be admitted that they not infrequently justify their reputation\r\nfor robbery, murder and counterfeiting. More than\r\nonce they have fomented bloody revolutions, one of them, the\r\ngreat Panthay rebellion of 1885-1874, costing the lives of no\r\nless than two million Moslems before it was suppressed.\r\n\r\nBut those who bore me up the long slope of Tai-shan were\r\nas good-natured as they were muscular. There is no difficulty\r\nabout ascending the mountain, for a stone-paved path about\r\nten feet wide runs from base to summit. The maker of this\r\nroad is unknown as the earliest records and monuments refer\r\nonly to repairs. But he builded well and evidently with ``an\r\nunlimited command of naked human strength,'' for the blocks\r\nof stone are heavy and the masonry of the walls and bridges is\r\nstill massive.\r\n\r\nAs the slope becomes steeper, the path merges into long\r\nflights of solid stone steps. Near the summit, these steps\r\nbecome so precipitous that the traveller is apt to feel a little\r\ndizzy, especially in descending, for the chair coolies race down\r\nthe steep stairway in a way that suggests alarming possibilities\r\nin the event of a misstep or a broken rope. But the men are\r\nsure-footed and mishaps seldom occur. The path is bordered\r\nby a low wall and lined with noble old trees. Ancient temples,\r\nquaint hamlets, numerous tea-houses and a few nunneries with\r\nvicious women are scattered along the route. A beautiful\r\nstream tumbles noisily down the mountainside close at hand,\r\nalternating swift rapids and deep, quiet pools, while as the\r\ntraveller rises, he gains magnificent vistas of the adjacent mountains\r\nand the wide cultivated plain, yellow with ripening wheat,\r\ngreen with growing millet, and thickly dotted with the groves\r\nbeneath which cluster the low houses of the villages.\r\n\r\nUp this long, steep pathway to the Buddhist temples on the\r\nsummit, multitudes of Chinese pilgrims toil each year, firmly\r\nbelieving that the journey will bring them merit. We reflected\r\nwith a feeling of awe that\r\n\r\n\r\n``The path by which we ascended has been trodden by the feet of men for\r\nmore than four thousand years. One hundred and fifty generations have\r\ncome and gone since the great Shun here offered up his yearly sacrifice to\r\nheaven. Fifteen hundred years before the bard of Greece composed his\r\nEpic, nearly one thousand years before Moses stood on Pisgah's mount\r\nand gazed over into the promised land, far back through the centuries\r\nwhen the world was young and humanity yet in its cradle, did the children\r\nof men ascend the vast shaggy sides of this same mountain, probably\r\nby this same path, and always to worship.''[15]\r\n\r\n\r\n[15] The Rev. Dr. Paul D. Bergen, pamphlet.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a night at Hsia-chang, we resumed our journey a little\r\nafter daylight. The early morning air was delightfully cool\r\nand bracing, but the sun's rays became fierce as we entered the\r\ndry, sandy bed of the Wen River. By the time we reached the\r\nbroad, shallow stream itself, I envied the two mules and the\r\ndonkey that managed to fall into a hole, though I would have\r\nbeen happier if they had been thoughtful enough to discard my\r\nspare clothes and my food box before they tumbled into the\r\nmuddy water. The whole day was unusually hot so that by\r\nthe time we reached Ning-yang, we were ready for a night's\r\nrest which even fighting mules, vicious vermin, and quarrelling\r\nChinese gamblers in the inn courtyard could not entirely\r\ndestroy.\r\n\r\nAs we approached Chining-chou, the country became almost\r\nperfectly flat, a vast prairie. It was carefully cultivated\r\neverywhere, the kao-liang and poppy predominating. The soil was\r\napparently rich, and the landscape was relieved from monotony\r\nby the green of the cultivated fields and the foliage of the village\r\ntrees. Dominating all is the rather imposing walled city\r\nof Chining-chou. The high, strong wall, the handsome gates\r\nand towers, the trees bordering the little stream and the\r\ncrowded streets looked quite metropolitan. With its imme-\r\ndiate suburbs built Chinese fashion close to the wall, Chining-\r\nchou has 150,000 inhabitants. It is a business city with a\r\nconsiderable trade, the produce of a wide adjacent region\r\nbeing brought to it for shipment, as it is on the Grand Canal\r\nwhich gives easy and cheap facilities for exporting and importing\r\nfreight. There is, moreover, no loss in exchange as the\r\ndanger of shipping bullion silver makes the Chining business\r\nmen eager to accept drafts for use in paying for the goods they\r\nbuy in Shanghai. Consequently there is a better price for\r\nsilver here than anywhere else in Shantung. The main street\r\nis narrow, shaded by matting laid on kao-liang stalks and\r\nlined with busy shops. Along the Grand Canal, there is a\r\nveritable ``Vanity Fair'' filled with clothing booths and deafening\r\nwith the cries of itinerant vendors.\r\n\r\nBut the loneliness of the missionary in Chining-chou is\r\ngreat, for he is far from congenial companionship. The tragedies\r\nof life are particularly heavy at such an isolated post.\r\nMr. Laughlin showed me the house where his wife's body lay\r\nfor a month after her death in May, 1899. Then, with his\r\nnine-year old daughter, he took the body in a house-boat down\r\nthe Grand Canal to Chin-kiang, a journey of sixteen days.\r\nWhat a heart-breaking journey it must have been as the clumsy\r\nboat crept slowly along the sluggish canal and the silent stars\r\nlooked down on the lonely husband beside the coffin of his\r\nbeloved wife. Yet he bravely returned to Chining-chou and\r\nwhile I travelled on, he remained with only Dr. Lyon for a\r\ncompanion. I was sorry to part with them for we had shared\r\nmany long-to-be-remembered experiences, while at that time\r\nthere was believed to be no small risk in remaining at such an\r\nisolated post. But Dr. Johnson and I had to go, and so early\r\non the morning of June 17, we bade the brave fellows an affectionate\r\ngood-bye and left them in that far interior city, standing\r\nat the East Gate till we were out of sight.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the day was fine for rain would have made the\r\nflat, black soil almost impassible. But as it was, we had a\r\ncomfortable, dustless ride of sixty li to Yen-chou-fu, a city of\r\nunusually massive walls, whose 60,000 people are reputed to be\r\nthe most fiercely anti-foreign in Shantung. Comparatively few\r\nforeigners had been seen in this region and many of them had\r\nbeen mobbed. The Roman Catholic priests, who are the only\r\nmissionaries here, have repeatedly been attacked, while an English\r\ntraveller was also savagely assaulted by these turbulent conservatives.\r\nBut the Roman Catholics with characteristic determination\r\nfought it out, the German consul coming from\r\nPeking to support them, and at the time of my visit, they were\r\nbuilding a splendid church, the money like that for the Chining-chou\r\ncathedral, coming from the indemnity for the murder\r\nof the two priests in 1897, which was in this diocese. Though\r\ngreat crowds stared silently at us, no disrespect was shown.\r\nOn the contrary, we found that by order of the district magistrate\r\nan inn had been specially prepared for us, with a plentiful\r\nsupply of rugs and cushions and screens, while a few minutes\r\nafter our arrival, the magistrate sent with his compliments a\r\nfeast of twenty-five dishes. Another stage of nine miles\r\nbrought us at four o'clock to the famous holy city of China,\r\nKu-fu, the home and the grave of Confucius.\r\n\r\nLeaving our shendzas at an inn, we mounted the cavalry\r\nhorses of our escort and hurried to the celebrated temple which\r\nstands on the site of Confucius' house. But to our keen\r\ndisappointment, the massive gates were closed. The keeper, in\r\nresponse to our knocks, peered through a crevice, and explained\r\nthat it was the great feast of the fifth day of the fifth\r\nmonth, that the Duke was offering sacrifices, and that no one,\r\nnot even officials, could enter till the sacrifices were completed.\r\n``When will that be?'' we queried. ``They will continue all\r\nnight and all day to-morrow,'' was the reply. We urged the\r\nshortness of our stay and solemnly promised to keep out of the\r\nDuke's way. The keeper's eyes watered as he imagined a\r\npresent, but he replied that he did not dare let us in as his\r\norders were strict and disobedience might cost him his position\r\nif not his life. So we sorrowfully turned away, and pushing\r\nthrough the dense throng which had swiftly assembled at the\r\nsight of a foreigner, we rode through the city and along the far-\r\nfamed Spirit Road to the Most Holy Grove in which lies the\r\nbody of Confucius. It is three li, about a mile, from the city\r\ngate. The road is shaded by ancient cedars and is called the\r\nSpirit Road because the spirit of Confucius is believed to walk\r\nback and forth upon it by night.\r\n\r\nThe famous cemetery is in three parts. The outer is said to\r\nbe fifteen miles in circumference and is the burial-place of all\r\nwho bear the honoured name of Confucius. Within, there is\r\na smaller enclosure of about ten acres, which is the family burial\r\nplace of the dukes who are lineal descendants of Confucius,\r\nmighty men who rank with the proudest governors of provinces.\r\nWithin this second enclosure, is the Most Holy Cemetery itself,\r\na plot of about two acres, shaded like the others by fine old\r\ncedars and cypresses. Here are only three graves, marked by\r\nhuge mounds under which lie the dust of Confucius, his son\r\nand his grandson. That of the Sage, we estimated to be\r\ntwenty-five feet high and 250 feet in circumference. In front\r\nof it is a stone monument about fifteen feet high, four feet wide\r\nand sixteen inches thick. Lying prone before that is another\r\nstone of nearly the same size supported by a heavy stone\r\npedestal. There is no name, but on the upright monument are\r\nChinese characters which Dr. Charles Johnson, my travelling\r\ncompanion, translated: ``The Acme of Perfection and Learning-\r\nPromoting King,'' or more freely--``The Most Illustrious\r\nSage and Princely Teacher.''\r\n\r\nUncut grass and weeds grew rankly upon the mounds and all\r\nover the cemetery, giving everything an unkempt appearance.\r\nOne species is said to grow nowhere else in China and to have\r\nsuch magical power in interpreting truth that if a leaf is laid\r\nupon an abstruse passage of Confucius, the meaning will immediately\r\nbecome clear. There are several small buildings in\r\nthe enclosure, but dust and decay reign in all, for there is no\r\nmerit in repairing a building that some one else has erected.\r\nAs with his house, the Chinese will spend money freely to build\r\na temple, but after that he does nothing. So even in the most\r\nsacred places, arches and walls and columns are usually crumbling,\r\ngrounds are dirty and pavement stones out of place.\r\n\r\nA feeling of awe came over me as I remembered that, with the\r\npossible exception of Buddha, the man whose dust lay before\r\nme had probably influenced more human beings than any other\r\nman whom the world has seen. Even Christ Himself has thus\r\nfar not been known to so many people as Confucius, nor has\r\nany nation in which Christ is known so thoroughly accepted\r\nHis teachings as China has accepted those of Confucius. Dr.\r\nLegge indeed declares that ``after long study of his character\r\nand opinions, I am unable to regard him as a great man,''\r\nwhile Dr. Gibson ``seeks in vain in his recorded life and words\r\nfor the secret of his power,'' and can only conjecture in explanation\r\nthat ``he is for all time the typical Chinaman; but\r\nhis greatness lies in his displaying the type on a grand scale,\r\nnot in creating it.'' But it is difficult even for the non-Chinese\r\nmind to look at such a man with unbiassed eyes. Surely we\r\nneed not begrudge the meed of greatness to one who has\r\nmoulded so many hundreds of millions of human beings for\r\n2,400 years and who is more influential at the end of that period\r\nthan at its beginning. Grant that ``he is for all time the\r\ntypical Chinaman.'' Could a small man have incarnated ``for\r\nall time'' the spirit of one-third of the human race? All over\r\nChina the evidences of Confucius' power can be seen. Temples\r\nrise on every hand. Ancestral tablets adorn every house.\r\nThe writings of the sage are diligently studied by the whole\r\npopulation. When, centuries ago, a jealous Emperor ruthlessly\r\nburned the Confucian books, patient scholars reproduced\r\nthem, and to prevent a recurrence of such iconoclastic fury, the\r\nGreat Confucian Temple and the Hall of Classics in Peking\r\nwere erected and the books were inscribed on long rows of stone\r\nmonuments so that they could never be destroyed again. As a\r\ntoken of the present attitude of the Imperial family, the Emperor\r\nonce in a decade proceeds in solemn state to this temple\r\nand enthroned there expounds a passage of the sacred writings.\r\nFor more than two millenniums, the boys of the most numerous\r\npeople in the world have committed to memory the Confucian\r\nprimer which declares that ``affection between father and son,\r\nconcord between husband and wife, kindness on the part of the\r\nelder brother and deference on the part of the younger, order\r\nbetween seniors and juniors, sincerity between friends and associates,\r\nrespect on the part of the ruler and loyalty on that of\r\nthe minister--these are the ten righteous courses equally binding\r\non all men;'' that ``the five regular constituents of our\r\nmoral nature are benevolence, righteousness, propriety, knowledge,\r\nand truth;'' and that ``the five blessings are long life\r\nwealth, tranquillity, desire for virtue and a natural death.''\r\n\r\nSurely these are noble principles. That their influence has\r\nbeen beneficial in many respects, it would be folly to deny.\r\nThey have lifted the Chinese above the level of many other\r\nAsiatic nations by creating a more stable social order, by inculcating\r\nrespect for parents and rulers, and by so honouring the\r\nmother that woman has a higher position in China than in most\r\nother non-Christian lands.\r\n\r\nAnd yet Confucianism has been and is the most formidable\r\nobstacle to the regeneration of China. While it teaches some\r\ngreat truths, it ignores others that are vital. It has lifted the\r\nChinese above the level of barbarism only to fix them almost\r\nimmovably upon a plane considerably lower than Christianity.\r\nIt has developed such a smug satisfaction with existing conditions\r\nthat millions are well-nigh impervious to the influences\r\nof the modern world. It has debased respect for parents into\r\na blind worship of ancestors so that a dead father, who may\r\nhave been an ignorant and vicious man, takes the place of the\r\nliving and righteous God. It has fostered not only premature\r\nmarriages but concubinage in the anxiety to have sons who\r\nwill care for parents in age and minister to them after death.\r\nIt makes the child virtually a slave to the caprice or passion of\r\nthe parent. It leads to a reverence for the past that makes\r\nchange a disrespect to the dead, so that all progress is made\r\nexceedingly difficult and society becomes fossilized. ``Whatever\r\nis is right'' and ``custom'' is sacred. Man is led so to\r\ncentralize his thought on his own family that he becomes selfish\r\nand provincial in spirit and conduct, with no outlook beyond\r\nhis own narrow sphere. Expenditures which the poor can ill-\r\nafford are remorselessly exacted for the maintenance of ancestral\r\nworship so that the living are often impoverished for the sake\r\nof the dead. $151,752,000 annually, ancestral worship is said\r\nto cost--a heavy drain upon a people the majority of whom\r\nspend their lives in the most abject poverty, while the development\r\nof true patriotism and a strong and well-governed State has\r\nbeen effectively prevented by making the individual solicitous\r\nonly for his own family and callously indifferent to the welfare\r\nof his country. Confucianism therefore is China's weakness\r\nas well as China's strength, the foe of all progress, the stagnation\r\nof all life.\r\n\r\nConfucianism, too, halts on the threshold of life's profoundest\r\nproblems. It has only dead maxims for the hour of deepest\r\nneed. It gives no vision of a future beyond the grave. It is\r\nvirtually an agnostic code of morals with some racial variations.\r\nWu Ting Fang, formerly Chinese Minister to the\r\nUnited States, frankly declares that ``Confucianism is not a religion\r\nin the practical sense of the word,'' and that ``Confucius\r\nwould be called an agnostic in these days.'' To ``the\r\nVenerable Teacher'' himself, philosophy opened no door of\r\nhope. Asked about this one day by a troubled inquirer, he\r\ndismissed the question with the characteristic aphorism--\r\n``Imperfectly acquainted with life, how can we know death?''\r\nAnd there the myriad millions of Confucianists have dully\r\nstood ever since, their faces towards the dead past, the future\r\na darkness out of which no voice comes.\r\n\r\nBut just because their illustrious guide took them to the\r\nverge of the dark unknown and left them there, other teachers\r\ncame in to occupy the region left so invitingly open. Less\r\nrational than Confucius, their success showed anew that the\r\nhuman mind cannot rest in a spiritual vacuum and that if\r\nfaith does not enter, superstition will. Taoism and Buddhism\r\nproceeded to people the air and the future with strange and\r\nawful shapes. Popular Chinese belief as to the future is gruesomely\r\nillustrated in the Temple of Horrors in Canton with its\r\nformidable collection of wooden figures illustrating the various\r\nmodes of punishment--sawing, decapitation, boiling in oil,\r\ncovering with a hot bell, etc. At funerals, bits of perforated\r\npaper are freely scattered about in the hope that the inquisitive\r\nspirits will stop to examine them and thus give the body a\r\nchance to pass. In any Chinese cemetery, one may see little\r\ntables in front of the graves covered with tea, sweetmeats and\r\nsheets of gilt and silver paper, so that if a spirit is hungry,\r\nthirsty or in need of funds, it can get drink, food or money\r\nfrom the gold or silver mines (paper).\r\n\r\nIn the Temple for Sickness, in Canton, where multitudes of\r\nsufferers pray to the gods for healing, we saw an old woman\r\nkneeling before a statue of Buddha, holding aloft two blocks of\r\nwood and then throwing them to the floor. If the flat side of\r\none and the oval side of the other were uppermost, the omen\r\nwas good, but if the same sides were up, it was bad. Others\r\nshook a box of numbered sticks till one popped out and then\r\na paper bearing the corresponding number gave the issue of the\r\ndisease. The stones of the court were worn by many feet and\r\nthe pathos of the place was pitiful.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, ``Confucianism is a system of morals, Taoism\r\na deification of nature and Buddhism a system of metaphysics.\r\nBut in practice all three have undergone many modifications.\r\n\r\nWith every age the character of Taoism has changed.\r\nThe philosophy of its founder is now only an antiquarian curiosity.\r\nModern Taoism is of such a motley character as almost\r\nto defy any attempt to educe a well-ordered system from its\r\nchaos.''[16] As for Buddhism, its founder would not recognize\r\nit, if he could visit China to-day. The lines:--\r\n\r\n ``Ten Buddhist nuns, and nine are bad;\r\n The odd one left is doubtless mad----''\r\n\r\nare suggestive of the depth to which the religion of Guatama\r\nhas fallen.\r\n\r\n\r\n[16] Smith, ``Rex Christus,'' pp. 62, 72.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed, it would be a mistake to suppose that the Chinese\r\npeople are divided into three religious bodies as, for example,\r\nAmericans are divided into Protestants, Roman Catholics and\r\nJews. Each individual Chinese is at the same time a Confucian,\r\na Buddhist and a Taoist, observing the ceremonies of\r\nall three faiths as circumstances may require, a Confucian\r\nwhen he worships his ancestors, a Buddhist when he implores\r\nthe aid of the Goddess of Mercy, and a Taoist when he seeks\r\nto propitiate the omnipresent fung-shuy (spirits of wind and\r\nwater), and he has no more thought of inconsistency than an\r\nAmerican who is at the same time a Methodist, a Republican\r\nand a Mason. Dr. S. H. Chester says that when he was in\r\nShanghai, he saw a Taoist priest conducting Confucian worship\r\nin a Buddhist temple. Even if inconsistency were proved to\r\nthe Chinese, he would not be in the least disturbed for he cares\r\nnothing for such considerations. ``Hence it is that the Chinese\r\nreligion of to-day has become an inextricable blending of\r\nthe three systems.''[17] ``The ancient simplicity of the state religion\r\nhas been so far corrupted as to combine in one ritual\r\ngods, ghosts, flags and cannon. It has become at once essentially\r\npolytheistic and pantheistic.''[18]\r\n\r\n\r\n[17] Gibson, ``Mission Methods and Mission Policy in South China.''\r\n\r\n[18] Williams, ``Middle Kingdom.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result is that the average Chinese lives a life of terror\r\nunder the sway of imaginary demons. He erects a rectangular\r\npillar in front of his door so that the dreaded spirits cannot\r\nenter his house without making an impossible turn. He gives\r\nhis tiled roof an upward slant at each of the eaves so that any\r\nspirit attempting to descend will be shunted off into space.\r\nNor is this superstition confined to the lower classes. The\r\nhaughty, foreign-travelled Li Hung Chang abjectly grovelled\r\non the bank of the Yellow River to propitiate an alleged demon\r\nthat was believed to be the cause of a disastrous flood, and as\r\nlate as June 4, 1903, the North-China Daily News published\r\nthe following imperial decree:\r\n\r\n\r\n``Owing to the continued drought, in spite of our prayers for rain, we\r\nhereby command Chen Pih, Governor of Peking, to proceed to the Dragon\r\ntemple at Kanshan-hsien, Chih-li Province, and bring from thence to\r\nPeking an iron tablet possessing rain-producing virtues, which we will\r\nplace up for adoration and thereby bring forth the much-desired rain.''\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so the followers of the most ``rational'' of teachers are\r\namong the most superstitious people in the world. In attempting\r\nto clear the mind of error, the great agnostic simply left it\r\n``empty, swept and garnished for seven other spirits worse than\r\nthe first.''\r\n\r\nAs in the deepening twilight we thoughtfully left the last\r\nresting-place of the mighty dead, a platoon of thirty Chinese\r\nsoldiers approached, drew their swords, dropped upon one\r\nknee and shouted. The movement was so unexpected and the\r\nshout so startlingly strident that my horse shied in terror and I\r\nhad visions of immediate massacre. But having learned that\r\npoliteness is current coin the world over, as soon as I could\r\ncontrol my prancing horse, I raised my hat and bowed.\r\nWhereupon the soldiers rose, wheeled into line and marched\r\nahead of us to our inn in the city. Dr. Johnson explained that\r\nthe words shouted in unison were: ``May the Great Man have\r\nPeace,'' and that the platoon was an escort of honour from the\r\nyamen of the district magistrate!\r\n\r\nOn the way, we stopped to visit the temple of Yen, the\r\nfavorite disciple whose early death left Confucius disconsolate.\r\nThe grounds are spacious. There is a remarkably fine\r\ntree, tall, graceful and with silvery white bark. A huge stone\r\nturtle was reverently kissed by one of our escort, who fondly\r\nbelieved that he who kissed the turtle's mouth would never be\r\nill. But as usual in China, the temple itself, though originally\r\nit must have been beautiful, is now crumbling in decay.\r\n\r\nIt was late when we returned, and as we were about to retire,\r\nwearied with the toils of the day, the district magistrate called\r\nwith an imposing retinue and cordially inquired whether we\r\nhad seen all that we wished to see. When we replied that we\r\nhad been unable to enter the great temple, he graciously said\r\nthat he would have pleasure in informing the Duke, who would\r\nbe sure to arrange for our visit. The result was a message at\r\ntwo o'clock in the morning to the effect that we might visit the\r\ntemple at daylight in the interval between the cessation of the\r\nsacrifices of the night and their resumption at seven o'clock in\r\nthe morning. Accordingly we rose at three o'clock, and after\r\na hurried breakfast by candle-light, we proceeded to the temple.\r\nAbout a hundred Chinese were awaiting us, among them two\r\nmen in official dress. We did not deem it courteous to ask\r\nwho or what they were, but we supposed them to be from the\r\nmagistrate's yamen, and as they were evidently familiar with\r\nthe temple, we gladly complied with their cordial invitation to\r\nfollow them.\r\n\r\nI wish I had power to describe adequately all we saw in that\r\nvast enclosure of about thirty acres, with its stately trees, its\r\npaved avenues, its massive monuments, and, above all, its\r\nimposing temple and scores of related buildings. One was the\r\nLieh Kew Kwei Chang Tien, the Temple of the Wall of the\r\nMany Countries. Here are 120 tablets, each about sixteen by\r\ntwenty-two inches, and in the centre three larger ones measuring\r\ntwo feet in width by four and a-half feet in height. In\r\nfront of these is a stone three and a-half feet by four and a-half,\r\nand bearing the inscription: ``Tribute from the Ten Thousand\r\nCountries of the World.'' The Chinese solemnly believe that\r\nin these tablets all the nations of the earth have acknowledged\r\nthe preeminence of Confucius.\r\n\r\nThen we visited three gloomy buildings where the animals for\r\nsacrifice are killed--one for cattle, one for sheep and one for\r\npigs. Beyond them, we entered temples to the wife of Confucius,\r\nto his parents and to the ``Five Generations of\r\nAncestors,'' though the last-mentioned contains tablets to nine\r\ngenerations instead of five. On every side are scores of monuments,\r\nerected by or in honour of famous kings, some of them\r\nby the monarchs of dynasties which flourished before the Christian\r\nera.\r\n\r\nMost notable of all is the great temple of the sage himself,\r\nstanding well back on a spacious stone-paved terrace, around\r\nwhich runs a handsome marble balustrade. The eye is at once\r\narrested by the twenty-eight noble marble pillars, ten in front,\r\nten in the rear and four at each end. The ten in front are\r\nround and elaborately carved, as magnificent a series of columns\r\nas I ever saw. The others are smooth, octagonal pillars, but\r\ntraced with various designs in black.\r\n\r\nWithin, there are twelve other columns about four feet in\r\ndiameter and twenty-five feet high, each cut from a single tree\r\nand beautifully polished. Naturally, the central object of\r\ninterest is a figure of Confucius of heroic size but impossible\r\nfeatures. In front is the tablet with costly lacquered ornaments\r\nand pedestals, and an altar on which were a bullock and\r\ntwo pigs, each carefully scraped and dressed and lying with\r\nheads towards the statue and tablet. In several other temples,\r\nnotably in the one to the Five Generations of Ancestors, other\r\nanimals were lying, some evidently offered the day before and\r\nothers awaiting the worship of the day now beginning.\r\nAltogether I counted nineteen sacrificial animals--one bullock,\r\neight sheep and ten pigs. The great temple is of noble proportions,\r\nwith an overhanging roof of enormous size but constructed\r\non such graceful lines as to be exquisitely beautiful.\r\nBut within dust reigns, while without as usual the grass and\r\nweeds grow unchecked.\r\n\r\nLast of all we visited the library, though the name is a\r\nmisnomer, for there are no books in it and our courteous guides\r\nsaid there never had been. We ascended the narrow stairs\r\nleading from the vast, empty, dusty room on the lower floor\r\nthrough an equally empty second story to the third and topmost\r\nstory, which is the home of hundreds of doves. Going\r\nout on the narrow balustrade under the eaves in the gray dawn\r\nof the morning, I looked upon the gorgeous gilded roof of the\r\ntemple near by and then down upon the many ancient buildings,\r\nthe darkly solemn pines, the massive monuments resting\r\non ponderous stone turtles, and the group of Chinese standing\r\namong the shadows and with faces turned curiously upward.\r\nSuddenly a dove flew over my head and then the sun rose\r\nslowly and majestically above the sombre tree-tops, throwing\r\nsplendid floods of light upon us who stood aloft. But the\r\nChinese below were in the sombre shades of a night that for\r\nthem had not yet fully ended. I would fain believe that the\r\nphysical was a parable of the spiritual. All the maxims of the\r\nAcme of Perfection and Learning-Promoting King have not\r\nbrought the Chinese out of moral twilight. After all these\r\ncenturies of ceaseless toil, they still remain amid the mists and\r\nshadows. But their faces are beginning to turn towards the\r\nlight of a day whose sun already touches the mountain-tops.\r\nSome even now are in that ``marvellous light,'' and it cannot\r\nbe long before shining hosts of God shall pour down the\r\nmountain-sides, chasing on noiseless feet and across wide plains\r\nthe swiftly retreating night ``until the day dawn and the\r\nshadows flee away.''\r\n\r\nAt the outer gate, we bade good-bye to the dignified officials\r\nwho had so hospitably conducted us through this venerable and\r\nhistoric place and who had taken such kindly pains to explain\r\nits ancient relics and customs. Who were they? we secretly\r\nwondered. Imagine our feelings when the lieutenant in command\r\nof our escort afterwards informed us that they were the\r\nguardian of the temple and the Duke himself!\r\n\r\nLeaving the city of the mighty dead, we journeyed through\r\na lovely region guarded by distant mountains. At the walled\r\ncity of Si-sui, sixty li distant, soldiers met us and apparently\r\nthe whole population lined the streets as we rode to our inn,\r\nwhere the yamen secretary was awaiting us with a feast.\r\nThis inn, too, had been specially cleaned, and there were\r\ncushions, red cloths for the seats, and a screen for the door.\r\nIn the afternoon, the country became rougher. But while the\r\nsoil was thinner, the scenery was finer, an undulating region\r\ntraversed by a shining river and bounded by mountains\r\nwhich gradually drew nearer. One hundred and ten li from\r\nKu-fu, we stopped for the night at Pien-kiao, a small city with\r\nan unusually poor inn but a magnificent spring. It gushed up\r\nover an area twenty-five feet square and with such volume that\r\nthe stream ran away like a mill-race. The Emperor Kien Lung\r\nbuilt a retaining wall about the spring and a temple and summer-\r\nhouse adjoining. The wall is as solid as ever, but only a\r\nfew crumbling pillars and fragments remain of the temple and\r\npavilion. The Emperor affirmed that he was told in a vision\r\nthat if he would build a stone boat, the waters of the spring\r\nwould float it to Nanking whither he wished to go. So he\r\nbuilt the boat of heavy cut stone, with a twelve-foot beam and\r\na length of fifty-five feet. It is still there with the prow five\r\nfeet above the ground, but the rest of the boat has sunk almost\r\nto the level of the earth about it. Is the old Emperor's idea any\r\nmore absurd to us than our iron boats would have been to him?\r\n\r\nThe sun struggled long with heavy mists the following morning\r\nand the air was so cool that I had to wrap myself in a\r\nblanket in the shendza. By eight, the sun gained the victory\r\nand we had another breezy, perfect June day. But the road\r\nwas stony and trying beyond anything we had yet seen. The\r\nvillages were evidently poorer, as might be expected on such a\r\nrocky soil. The people stared silently and did not so often return\r\nmy smiles. Whether they were sullen or simply boorish\r\nand unaccustomed to foreigners I could only conjecture. Few\r\nwhite men had been seen there.\r\n\r\nA hard day's journey of 140 li through a rocky region\r\nbrought us to Fei-hsien. Rain was falling the next morning\r\nand the Chinese muleteers do not like to travel in rain. But\r\nthe prospect was for a steady pour and as we were in a wretched\r\ninn and only ninety li from Ichou-fu, we wanted to go on.\r\nA present of 600 small cash for each muleteer (twenty\r\ncents) overcame all scruples. Just as I had comfortably\r\nensconced myself in my shendza with an oilcloth on top and a\r\nrubber blanket in front, I saw a centipede on my leg, but I\r\nmanaged to slay him before he bit me. By nine, the rain\r\nceased and though the clouds still threatened, we had a cool\r\nand comfortable ride through hundreds of fields of peanuts,\r\nindigo and millet to I-tang, where we stopped for tiffin at a\r\nsqualid inn kept by a tall, dilapidated looking Chinese, who rejoiced\r\nin the name of Confucius. He was really a descendant\r\nof the sage and was very proud of the fact that his bones were\r\nin due time to rest in the sacred cemetery at Ku-fu.\r\n\r\nBy 5:40 P. M. we reached Ichou-fu, where the solitary Rev.\r\nW. W. Faris was glad to see another white man. A\r\nstay of several days was marked by many pleasant incidents.\r\nThere was much of interest for a visitor to see. The mission\r\nwork at Ichou-fu, Presbyterian, includes two hospitals, one for\r\nmen and one for women, a chapel and separate day schools for\r\nboys and girls. The church has about a hundred members\r\nand in the outstations there are ten other organized churches\r\nbesides ten unorganized congregations. All these churches\r\nand congregations provide their own chapels and pay their own\r\nrunning expenses. Here also the officials were most courteous.\r\nThe Prefect, who promptly called with a retinue of fifty\r\nsoldiers and attendants, was a masterful looking man who\r\nconversed with intelligence on a wide variety of topics. The\r\nday before our departure, we gave a feast to the leading men\r\nof the city in return for their many courtesies. Every invitation\r\nwas accepted and thirty-five guests were present. They\r\nremained till late and were apparently highly pleased.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening, a youth who had painfully walked 180\r\nli, came to Dr. Johnson's dispensary and presented the following\r\nnote of introduction:\r\n\r\n``Our office a servant who getting a yellow sick, which\r\nsuffered a few year and cured for nothing. he trusted me to\r\nbeg you to save his sick and I now ordered him to going before\r\nyou to beg you remedy facely. With many thanks to you,\r\n                             ``Yours sincerely,\r\n                                         ``V. T. GEE.''\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving done all that was possible in so short a time to\r\n``save his sick,'' we resumed our journey, thirty Chinese\r\nChristians accompanying us to the River I, a li from the city.\r\nThe atmosphere was gloriously clear and on the second day\r\nout, crossing some high ridges, we had superb views of wide\r\ncultivated valleys, and of Ku-chou, a famous city that is said\r\nto contain more literary graduates than any other city of its\r\nsize in the province.\r\n\r\nThen followed a more level country with interminable fields\r\nof kao-liang and many orchards of walnuts, pears and cherries,\r\nwhile low mountains rose in the background. Men and horses\r\nwere tired after our long and hard journey, and the mules'\r\nbacks were becoming very sore. But the end drew near and\r\nthe fifth day from Ichow-fu we reached Yueh-kou, the border\r\nof the German hinterland. The German line is near Kiaochou,\r\nbut the rule is that Chinese soldiers must not come beyond\r\nthis point, 100 li from the line, and that German\r\nsoldiers shall not cross it going the other way except on the line\r\nof the railroad. Here therefore our escort had to leave us, as\r\nChinese and Germans have agreed that any armed men crossing\r\nthe line may be fired on, and even if there should be no\r\ncasualty, both the German and Chinese authorities might justly\r\nhave protested if Americans violated the compact. I suggested\r\ngoing on without an escort to our proposed night stop thirty\r\nli further. But my more experienced companions thought it\r\ndangerous to spend the night alone at an inn within this belt,\r\nas the villagers near the line were as bitter against foreigners\r\nas any in the province, the German brusqueness and ruthlessness\r\nhaving greatly exasperated them.\r\n\r\nSo we spent the night at Yueh-kou. No one interfered with\r\nus the next day and by getting an early start, we covered ninety\r\nlong li to Kiao-chou by noon. After five weeks in a mule\r\nlitter, it seemed wonderful to make 138 li in three hours in a\r\nrailway car. By 6:50 P. M., we reached Tsing-tau, having,\r\nthe missionaries said, succeeded in ``hustling the East to a\r\nremarkable degree.'' My note-book reads--``A bath, clean\r\nclothes, a hot supper and a good night's sleep removed the\r\nlast vestige of weariness.''\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nSOME EXPERIENCES OF A TRAVELLER--FEASTS,\r\nINNS AND SOLDIERS\r\n\r\nTHE hardships of interior travelling were less than I\r\nhad supposed. It is true that there were many\r\nexperiences which, if enumerated, would make a formidable\r\nlist. But each as it arose appeared insignificant. As a\r\nwhole, the trip was as enjoyable as any vacation tour. The\r\nweather was as a rule fine. The sun was often hot in the\r\nmiddle of the day, but cool breezes usually tempered the heat\r\nof the afternoon, while the nights required the protection of\r\nblankets. There was some rain at times, but not enough to\r\nimpede seriously our progress. It was altogether the most\r\nperfect May and June weather I have ever seen. Nor was it\r\nexceptional, according to Dr. Charles Johnson who has spent\r\nmany years in North China. But of course I saw Shantung\r\nat its most favourable period. July and August are wet and\r\nhot, while the winters are clear and cold.\r\n\r\nI found a trunk an unmitigated nuisance. Though it was\r\nmade to order for a pack-mule, no pack-mules could be hired in\r\nthat harvest season, and the trunk was too heavy for one side\r\nof a donkey, even after transferring all practicable articles to\r\nthe shendza. So it had to be put in a cart, and as a cart cannot\r\nkeep up with a shendza, I was often separated from my\r\ntrunk for days at a time. Besides, a couple valises would have\r\nheld all necessary clothing anyway. I took a light folding cot\r\nand a bag held a thin mattress, small pillow, sheets and two\r\nlight blankets, so that I had a very comfortable bed under the\r\nalways necessary mosquito net.\r\n\r\nWe also took a supply of tinned food to which we could\r\nusually add by purchase en route chickens and eggs, while occasionally\r\nin the proper season, we could secure string-beans,\r\nonions, cucumbers, apricots, peanuts, walnuts and radishes.\r\nSo we fared well. The native food cannot be wisely depended\r\nupon by a foreigner. He cannot maintain his strength, as the\r\npoorer Chinese do, on a diet of rice and unleavened bread,\r\nwhile the food of the well-to-do classes, when it can be had, is\r\napt to be so greasy and peculiar as to incite his digestive apparatus\r\nto revolt. Indeed, a Chinese feast is one of his most\r\nserious experiences. Most heartily, indeed, did I appreciate\r\nthe kindly motives of the magistrates who invited me to these\r\nfeasts, for their purpose was as generously hospitable as the\r\npurpose of any American who invites a visitor to dinner. But\r\nthe Chinese bill-of-fare includes dishes that are rather trying to\r\na Christian palate, and good form requires the guest to taste at\r\nleast each dish, for if he fails to do so, he makes his host\r\n``lose face''--a serious breach of etiquette in China. For\r\nexample, here is the menu of a typical Chinese feast to which\r\nI was invited, the dishes being served in the order given,\r\nsweets coming first and soup towards the last in this land of\r\ntopsy-turveydom:\r\n\r\n1. Small cakes (five kinds), sliced pears, candied peanuts,\r\nraw water-chestnuts, cooked water-chestnuts, hard-boiled ducks'\r\neggs (cut into small pieces), candied walnuts, honied walnuts,\r\nshredded chicken, apricot seeds, sliced pickled plums, sliced\r\ndried smoked ham (cut into tiny pieces), shredded sea moss,\r\nwatermelon seeds, shrimps, bamboo sprouts, jellied haws. All\r\nthe above dishes were cold. Then followed hot:\r\n\r\n2. Shrimps served in the shell with vinegar, sea-slugs with\r\nshredded chicken, bits of sweetened pork and shredded dough\r\n--the pork and sea-slugs being cooked and served in fragrant\r\noil.\r\n\r\n3. Bamboo sprouts, stewed chicken kidneys.\r\n\r\n4. Spring chicken cooked crisp in oil.\r\n\r\n5. Stewed sea-slugs with ginger root and bean curd,\r\nstewed fungus with reed roots and ginger tops (all hot).\r\n\r\n6. Tarts with candied jelly, sugar dumplings with dates.\r\n\r\n7. Hot pudding made of ``the eight precious vegetables,''\r\nconsisting of dates, watermelon seeds, chopped walnuts, chopped\r\nchestnuts, preserved oranges, lotus seeds, and two kinds of rice,\r\nall mixed and served in syrup--a delicious dish.\r\n\r\n8. Shelled shrimps with roots of reeds and bits of hard-\r\nboiled eggs, all in one bowl with fragrant oil, biscuits coated\r\nwith sweet seeds.\r\n\r\n9. Glutinous rice in little layers with browned sugar between,\r\nminced pork dumplings, steamed biscuits.\r\n\r\n10. Omelette with sea-slugs and bamboo sprouts, all in oil,\r\nbits of chicken stewed in oil, pork with small dumplings of\r\nflour and starch.\r\n\r\n11. Stewed pigs' kidneys, shrimps stewed in oil, date pie.\r\n\r\n12. Vermicelli and egg soup.\r\n\r\n13. Stewed pork balls, reed roots, bits of hard-boiled yolks\r\nof eggs, all in oil.\r\n\r\n14. Birds' nest soup.\r\n\r\nThe appetite being pretty well sated by this time, the following\r\ndelicacies were served to taper off with:\r\n\r\n15. Chicken boiled in oil, pork swimming in a great bowl\r\nof its own fat, stewed fish stomachs, egg soup.\r\n\r\n16. Steamed biscuit.\r\n\r\nTea was served from the beginning and throughout the feast.\r\nIt was made on the table by pouring hot water into a small pot\r\nhalf full of tea leaves, the pot being refilled as needed. The\r\ntea was served without cream or sugar, and was mild and delicious.\r\nRice whiskey in tiny cups is usually served at feasts,\r\nthough it was often omitted from the feasts given to us. The\r\nChinese assert that the alcohol is necessary ``to cut the grease.''\r\nThere is certainly enough grease to cut.\r\n\r\nThe guests sit at small round tables, each accommodating\r\nabout four. There are, of course, no plates or knives or forks\r\nthough small china spoons are used for the soups. All the\r\nfood is cut into small pieces before being brought to the table,\r\nso that no further cutting is supposed to be necessary. Each\r\narticle of food is brought on in a single dish, which is placed\r\nin the centre of the table, and then each guest helps himself\r\nout of the common dish with his chop-sticks, the same chop-\r\nsticks being used during the entire meal. It is considered a\r\nmark of distinguished courtesy for the host to fish around in\r\nthe dish with his own chop-sticks for a choice morsel and place\r\nit in front of the guest. With profound emotion, at almost\r\nevery feast that I attended in China, I saw my considerate\r\nhosts take the chop-sticks which had made many trips to their\r\nown mouths, stir around in the central dish for a particularly fine\r\ntitbit and deposit it on the table before me. And of course,\r\nnot to be outdone in politeness, I ate these dainty morsels with\r\nsmiles of gratified pride. As each of the Chinese at the table\r\ndeemed himself my host, and as the Chinese are extremely\r\npolite and attentive to their guests, the table soon became wet\r\nand greasy from the pieces of pork, slugs and chicken placed\r\nupon it as well as from the drippings from the chop-sticks in\r\ntheir constant trips from the serving bowls.\r\n\r\nHowever, two small brass bowls, fitting together, are placed\r\nbeside each guest, who is expected to sip a little water from the\r\nupper one, rinse his mouth with it and expectorate it into the\r\nlower one. The emotion of the foreign visitor is intensified\r\nwhen he learns that it is counted polite to make all the noise\r\npossible by smacking the lips as a sign that the food is delicious,\r\nsucking the tea or soup noisily from the spoon to show\r\nthat it is hot, and belching to show that it is enjoyed. Often,\r\na dignified official would let his tea stand until it was cold, but\r\nwhen he took it up, he would suck it with a loud noise as if it\r\nwere scalding hot, as he was too polite to act as if it were cold.\r\n\r\nBut the American or European, who inwardly groans at a\r\nChinese repast and who felicitates himself on the alleged\r\nsuperior methods of his own race, may well consider how his\r\nown customs impress a Celestial. A Chinese gentleman who\r\nwas making a tour of Europe and America wrote to a relative\r\nin China as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n``You cannot civilize these foreign devils. They are beyond redemption.\r\nThey will live for weeks and months without touching a mouthful\r\nof rice, but they eat the flesh of bullocks and sheep in enormous quantities.\r\nThat is why they smell so badly; they smell like sheep themselves.\r\nEvery day they take a bath to rid themselves of their disagreeable odours\r\nbut they do not succeed. Nor do they eat their meat cooked in small\r\npieces. It is carried into the room in large chunks, often half raw, and\r\nthey cut and slash and tear it apart. They eat with knives and prongs.\r\nIt makes a civilized being perfectly nervous. One fancies himself in the\r\npresence of sword-swallowers. They even sit down at the same table with\r\nwomen, and the latter are served first, reversing the order of nature.''\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I humbly adapted myself as best I could to Chinese customs\r\nand learned to like many of the natives' dishes, though to\r\nthe last, there were some that I merely nibbled to ``save the\r\nface'' of mine host. Some of the dishes were really excellent\r\nand as a rule all were well-cooked, although the oil in which\r\nmuch of the food was steeped made it rather greasy. My digestive\r\napparatus is pretty good, but it would take a copper-\r\nlined stomach to partake without disaster of a typical Chinese\r\nfeast. But for that matter so it would to eat a traditional New\r\nEngland dinner of boiled salt pork, corned beef, cabbage, turnips,\r\nonions and potatoes, followed by a desert of mince pie\r\nand plum pudding and all washed down by copious draughts\r\nof hard cider.\r\n\r\nChinese inns do not impoverish even the economical traveller.\r\nOur bill for our tiffin stop was usually 100 small cash, a little\r\nmore than three cents, for our entire party of about a score of\r\nmen and animals. For the night, the common charge was 700\r\ncash, twenty-three cents. Travellers are expected to provide\r\ntheir own food and bedding and to pay a small extra sum for\r\nthe rice and fodder used by their servants and mules, but even\r\nthen the cost appears ridiculously small to a foreigner. Still,\r\nthe most thoroughly seasoned traveller can hardly consider a\r\nChinese inn a comfortable residence. It is simply a rough,\r\none-story building enclosing an open courtyard. The rooms\r\nare destitute of furniture except occasionally a rude table. The\r\nfloor is the beaten earth, foul with the use of scores and perhaps\r\nhundreds of years. The windows are covered with oiled\r\npaper which admits only a dim light and no air at all. The\r\nwalls are begrimed with smoke and covered with cobwebs.\r\nAcross the end of the room is the inevitable kang--a brick platform\r\nunder which the cooking fire is built and on which the\r\ntraveller squats by day and sleeps by night. The unhappy\r\nwhite man who has not been prudent enough to bring a cot\r\nwith him feels as if he were sleeping on a hot stove with ``the\r\nlid off.''\r\n\r\nThe inns between Ichou-fu and Chining-chou were the poorest\r\nI saw, and if a man has stopped in one of them, he has been\r\nfairly initiated into the discomforts of travelling in China. But\r\nwherever one goes, the heat and smoke and bad air, together\r\nwith the vermin which literally swarms on the kang and floor\r\nand walls, combine to make a night in a Chinese inn an experience\r\nthat is not easily forgotten. However, the foreign\r\ntraveller soon learns, perforce, to be less fastidious than at home\r\nand I found myself hungry enough to eat heartily and tired\r\nenough to sleep soundly in spite of the dirt and bugs. But the\r\nheat and bad air as the summer advanced were not so easily\r\nmastered, and so I began to sleep in the open courtyard, finding\r\nchattering Chinese and squealing mules less objectionable\r\nthan the foul-smelling, vermin-infested inns, since outside I had\r\nat least plenty of cool, fresh air.\r\n\r\nThere is no privacy in a Chinese inn. The doors, when\r\nthere are any, are innocent of locks and keys, while the Chinese\r\nguests as well as the innkeeper's family and the people of the\r\nneighbourhood have an inquisitiveness that is not in the least\r\ntempered by bashfulness. But nothing was ever stolen, though\r\nsome of our supplies must have been attractive to many of the\r\npoverty stricken men who crowded about us. On one occasion,\r\nan inn-employee, who was sent to exchange a bank-note\r\nfor cash, did not return. There was much excited jabbering,\r\nbut Mr. Laughlin firmly though kindly held the innkeeper responsible\r\nand that worthy admitted that he knew who had taken\r\nthe money and refunded it. So all was peace. The innkeeper\r\nwas probably in collusion with the thief. This was our\r\nonly trouble of the kind, though we slept night after night in\r\nthe public inns with all our goods lying about wholly unprotected.\r\nOccasionally, especially in the larger towns, there was\r\na night watchman. But he was a noisy nuisance. To convince\r\nhis employers that he was awake, he frequently clapped\r\ntogether two pieces of wood. All night long that strident\r\nclack, clack, clack, resounded every few seconds. It is an odd\r\ncustom, for of course it advertises to thieves the location of the\r\nwatchman. But there is much in China that is odd to an\r\nAmerican.\r\n\r\nOn a tour in Asia, the foreigner who does not wish to be ill\r\nwill exercise reasonable care. It looks smart to take insufficient\r\nsleep, snatch a hurried meal out of a tin can, drink unboiled\r\nwater and walk or ride in the sun without a pith hat or an\r\numbrella. Some foreigners who ought to know better are careless\r\nabout these things and good-naturedly chaff one who is\r\nmore particular. But while one should not be unnecessarily\r\nfussy, yet if he is courageous enough to be sensible, he will not\r\nonly preserve his health, but be physically benefited by his\r\ntour, while the heedless man will probably be floored by dysentery\r\nor even if he escapes that scourge will reach his destination\r\nso worn out that he must take days or perhaps weeks to recuperate.\r\nI was not ill a day, made what Dr. Bergen called\r\n``the record tour of Shantung,'' and came out in splendid\r\nhealth and spirits just because I had nerve enough to insist on\r\ntaking reasonable time for eating and sleeping, boiling my\r\ndrinking water, and buying the fresh vegetables and fruit with\r\nwhich the country abounded. From this view-point, Dr.\r\nCharles F. Johnson, who escorted me from Chining-chou to\r\nTsing-tau, was a model. With no loss of time, with but trifling\r\nadditional expense and with comparatively little extra trouble,\r\nhe had an appetizing table, while water bottles and fruit tins\r\nwere always cooled in buckets of well water so that they were\r\ngrateful to a dusty, thirsty throat. It is not difficult to make\r\noneself fairly comfortable in travelling even when nearly all\r\nmodern conveniences are wanting and it pays to take the necessary\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nThroughout the tour, we were watched in a way that was\r\nsuggestive. When United States Consul Fowler first told me\r\nthat Governor Yuan Shih Kai would send a military escort\r\nwith me, I said that I was not proud, that I did not care to go\r\nthrough Shantung with the pomp and panoply of war, that I\r\nwas on a peaceful, conciliatory errand, and preferred to travel\r\nwith only my missionary companions. But he replied that\r\nwhile the province was then quiet, no one could tell what an\r\nhour might bring forth, that in the tension that existed even a\r\nlocal and sporadic attack on a foreigner might be a signal for a\r\nnew outbreak, that the Governor was trying to keep the people\r\nin hand, and that as he was held responsible for consequences\r\nhe must be allowed to have his own men in charge of a foreign\r\nparty that purposed to journey so far into the interior. So, of\r\ncourse, I yielded.\r\n\r\nWhen I lifted up my eyes and looked on the escort at Kiao-\r\nchou, I felt that my fears of pomp and panoply had been\r\ngroundless, for the ``escort'' consisted of two disreputable-\r\nlooking coolies who had apparently been picked up on the\r\nstreet and who were armed with antiquated flint-locks that\r\nwere more dangerous to their bearers than to an enemy. I am\r\nsure that these ``guards'' would have been the first to run at\r\nthe slightest sign of danger. We did not see them again till\r\nwe reached Kaomi, where we gave them a present and sent\r\nthem back, glad to be rid of them. We afterwards learned\r\nthat they were only the retainers of the local Kiao-chou yamen\r\nto see us to the border of the hinterland, which Governor\r\nYuan's troops were not permitted to cross.\r\n\r\nBut the men who met us at the border were soldiers of\r\nanother type--powerful looking cavalrymen on excellent horses.\r\nRemembering the stories we had heard regarding the murder\r\nof foreigners by Chinese troops who had been sent ostensibly\r\nto guard them, we were relieved to find that there were only\r\nthree of them, and as there were three of us, we felt safe, for we\r\nbelieved that in an emergency we could whip them. When\r\non leaving Wei-hsien the number increased to five and then to\r\nsix, we became dubious. But we concluded that as we were\r\nactive, stalwart men, we might in a pinch manage twice our\r\nnumber of Chinese soldiers or, if worst came to worst, as we\r\nwere unencumbered by women, children or luggage, we could\r\nsprint, on the old maxim,\r\n\r\n ``He that fights and runs away\r\n Will live to fight another day.''\r\n\r\nBut when a little later, the force grew to eleven and then to\r\nfifteen, we were hopelessly out-classed, especially as they were\r\nwell-mounted and armed not only with swords but with modern\r\nmagazine rifles.\r\n\r\nThe result, however, proved that our fears were groundless,\r\nfor the men were good soldiers, intelligent, respectful, well-\r\ndrilled, and thoroughly disciplined. They treated us with\r\nstrict military etiquette, standing at attention and saluting in\r\nthe most approved military fashion whenever they spoke to us\r\nor we to them. I was not accustomed to travelling in such\r\nstate. Our three shendzas meant six mules and three muleteers,\r\none for each shendza. Our cook and ``boy'' each had\r\na donkey, and a pack-mule was necessary for our food supplies.\r\nSo including the men and horses of the escort, we\r\nusually had nineteen men and twenty animals and a part of the\r\ntime we had even a larger number. We therefore made quite\r\na procession, and attracted considerable attention. I suspect,\r\nhowever, that some of those shrewd Chinese were not deceived\r\nas to my humble station at home for one man asked the missionary\r\nwho accompanied me whether I travelled with an escort\r\nin America!\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant commanding our escort said that he received\r\nforty-two taels a month,[19] the sergeants eleven taels, and the\r\nprivates nine taels. The men buy their own food, but their\r\nclothing, horses, provender, etc., are furnished by the Government.\r\nThis is big pay for China. The lieutenant further said\r\nthat Governor Yuan Shih Kai had thirty regiments of a nominal\r\nstrength of 500 each and an actual strength of 250, making\r\na total of 7,500, and that the soldiers had been drilled by\r\nGerman officers at Tien-tsin. There are no foreign officers\r\nnow connected with the force, but there are two foreign educated\r\nChinese who receive 300 taels a month each. He further\r\nsaid that all the men with us had killed Boxers and that he\r\nwas confident that they could rout 1,000 of them. An illustration\r\nof the reputation of these troops occurred during my\r\nvisit in Paoting-fu a little later. A messenger breathlessly\r\nreported that the Allied Villagers, who had banded themselves\r\ntogether to resist the collection of indemnity, had captured a\r\ncity only ninety li southward and that they intended to march\r\non Paoting-fu itself. Three thousand of Yuan Shih Kai's\r\ntroops had been ordered to go to Peking to prepare for the\r\nreturn of the Emperor and Empress Dowager, but the French\r\ngeneral at Paoting-fu had forbade them coming beyond a point\r\na hundred li south of Paoting-fu, so that they were then encamped\r\nthere awaiting further orders. The Prefect hastily wired\r\nViceroy Li Hung Chang in Peking asking him to order these\r\ntroops to retake the recaptured city, as the Imperial troops were\r\n``needed here,'' a euphemism for saying that they were useless.\r\nLi Hung Chang gave the desired order and the seasoned troops\r\nof Yuan Shih Kai made short work of the Allied Villagers.\r\n\r\n\r\n[19] A tael equals sixty-five cents at the present rate of exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt any rate, those who escorted me through Shantung were\r\ncertainly good soldiers. They had splendid horses and took\r\ngood care of them, while several evenings they gave us as fine\r\nexhibitions of sword drill as I ever saw. I was interested to\r\nfind that seven of them belonged to a total abstinence society,\r\nthough none of them were Christians. I became really attached\r\nto them. They were very patient, although my journey\r\ncompelled them to make a long and hard march for which they\r\nreceived no extra pay. On the last evening of the trip, I gave\r\nthem a feast in the most approved Chinese style. I made a\r\nlittle farewell address and gave the officer in charge the following\r\nletter which seemed to please them greatly:--\r\n\r\n                    ``June 27th, 1901.\r\n ``To His Excellency,\r\n     ``General Yuan Shih Kai,\r\n\r\n     ``Governor of the Province of Shantung, China,\r\n ``SIR:\r\n     ``In completing my tour of the Province of Shantung, I have pleasure\r\nin expressing my high appreciation, and that of the missionaries of the\r\nPresbyterian Church who accompanied me, of the excellent conduct of the\r\nsoldiers who formed our escort under the command of (Lieutenant) Wang\r\nPa Chung. Both he and his troopers were courteous and faithful, attentive\r\nto every duty and meriting our admiration for the perfection of their\r\ndiscipline.\r\n\r\n``We regret the death of one of their horses, but we are satisfied that\r\nthe soldier was in no way to blame. The animal died in the inn courtyard\r\nearly in the morning.\r\n\r\n``I have had pleasure in giving the officer and his men a feast. In\r\naddition I offered them a present, but the Wang Pa Chung declined to\r\naccept it.\r\n\r\n``Thanking you for your courtesy in detailing such good soldiers for\r\nour escort,\r\n\r\n``I have, sir, the honour to be\r\n               ``Your obedient servant,\r\n                       (Signed) ``ARTHUR J. BROWN.''\r\n\r\n\r\nI was impressed by the refusal to accept the present, which\r\nwas a considerable sum to Chinese. But the men were evidently\r\nunder strict orders. The lieutenant was polite and\r\ngrateful, but he said that he ``could not accept a gift if it were\r\nten thousand taels.''\r\n\r\nDuring the whole tour, these soldiers watched us with a fidelity\r\nthat was almost embarrassing at times. Not for a moment\r\ndid they lose sight of us except when we were in the mission\r\ncompounds. If we took a walk about a village, they followed\r\nus. Eating, sleeping or travelling, we were always watched.\r\nSeveral times we tried to escape such espionage, or to induce\r\nthe soldiers to turn back. We did not feel our need of them,\r\nnor did I desire my peaceful mission to be associated with military\r\ndisplay. Besides, if hostility had been manifested, a\r\ndozen Chinese soldiers would have been of little avail among\r\nthose swarming millions. But our efforts and protests were\r\nvain and we had no alternative but to submit with the best\r\ngrace possible.\r\n\r\nNor was this all, for many of the magistrates whose districts\r\nwe crossed en route added other attentions. Indeed, they appeared\r\nto be almost nervously anxious that no mishap should\r\nbefall us. I had sent no announcement of my coming to any\r\none except my missionary friends, nor had I asked for any favour\r\nor protection save the usual passport through the United States\r\nConsul. But the first Tao-tai I met politely inquired about my\r\nroute, and, as I afterwards learned, sent word to the next\r\nmagistrate. He in turn forwarded the word to the one beyond,\r\nand so on throughout the whole trip. As we approached a\r\ncity, uniformed attendants from the chief magistrate's yamen\r\nusually met us and escorted us, sometimes with much display\r\nof banners and trumpets and armed guards, to an inn which\r\nhad been prepared for our reception by having a little of its\r\ndirt swept into the corners and a few of its bugs killed. Then\r\nwould come a feast of many courses of Chinese delicacies. A\r\ncall from the magistrate himself often followed, and he would\r\nchat amicably while great crowds stood silently about.\r\n\r\nThere was something half pathetic about the attentions we\r\nreceived. Our journey was like a triumphal procession. For\r\nexample, twenty li from Chang Ku a messenger on horseback\r\nmet us. He had evidently been on the watch, for after kneeling\r\nhe galloped back with the news of our approach. Soon\r\na dozen soldiers in scarlet uniforms appeared, saluted, wheeled\r\nand marched before us to an inn where we found rugs on the\r\nfloor and kangs, a cloth on the table and two elevated seats\r\ncovered with scarlet robes. Attendants from the yamen with\r\ntheir red tasselled helmets were numerous and attentive.\r\nBasins of water were brought and presently the magistrate sent\r\nan elaborate feast. As we finished the repast, the magistrate\r\nhimself called. He was very affable and made quite a long\r\ncall. In like manner the district magistrate of Fei-hsien sent\r\nhis secretary, personal flags and twenty soldiers twenty li to\r\nmeet us. They knelt as we approached and shouted in\r\nunison--``We wish the great man peace!'' So as usual we\r\nentered the town with pomp and circumstance, our own escort\r\nadded to the local one making a brave show.\r\n\r\nAnd these were typical experiences. We could not prevent\r\nthem and to resent them would have made the official ``lose\r\nface'' and so embittered him. At Pien-kiao, where a hundred\r\nof Governor Yuan Shih Kai's troops were stationed, the whole\r\ngarrison turned out, meeting us a couple of miles from the city\r\nand escorting us to our inn with blares of trumpets which\r\nDr. Johnson said were only sounded for high officials.\r\nWe were awakened at three o'clock the next morning by the\r\nbellowing of calves and the braying of mules in the inn courtyard,\r\nand as we had our longest day's journey ahead of us, we\r\nrose, breakfasted at four by candle-light and were on the road\r\nat a quarter of five. But in spite of the early hour, the whole\r\ngarrison again turned out and lined the road at ``present\r\narms'' as we passed.\r\n\r\nThink of the mayor of an American city of fifty or a hundred\r\nthousand habitants hastening to call in state on three\r\nunknown travellers, who were simply stopping for luncheon at a\r\nhotel, and sending a couple dozen policemen to escort them in\r\nand out of town! The Shantung Chinese are a strong, proud,\r\nindependent people, and it must have cost them something to be\r\nso effusive to foreigners. There was doubtless in it some real\r\nregard for Americans and American missionaries. But policy\r\nwas probably also a factor. The officials felt that any further\r\nattack on foreigners would be a pretext for further foreign\r\naggression, an excuse for Germany to advance from Kiao-chou,\r\nand they were anxious not to give occasion for it. Each\r\nofficial was apparently determined to make it plain that he was\r\ndoing his duty in trying to protect these foreigners so that if\r\nthey got hurt it would not be his fault. Perhaps, too, he was\r\nnot averse to showing the populace that foreigners had to be\r\nguarded. I was half ashamed to travel in that way. But I\r\ncould not help myself. Sometimes I felt that the guard was not\r\nso much for us as for the Chinese, assuring nervous officials that\r\nforeigners should have no further excuse for aggression and\r\nwarning the evil-disposed that they must not commit acts\r\nwhich might get the officials into trouble.\r\n\r\nWhatever the reasons were, they were plainly impersonal.\r\nNo one of us had any official status nor were we as individuals\r\nof any consequence whatever to Chinese officials. We were\r\nsimply white men and as such we were regarded as representatives\r\nof a race which had made its power felt. Perhaps\r\nthe soldiers and the orders of Governor Yuan Shih Kai had\r\nmuch to do with the quietness of the people, but some way\r\nI felt perfectly safe. Whether any attack would have been\r\nmade if I had been allowed to journey quietly with my one or\r\ntwo missionary companions, I am not competent to judge.\r\nForeigners who had lived many years in China told me before\r\nstarting that my life would not be safe beyond rifle shot.\r\nThey have told me since that the profuse attentions that we received\r\nwere mere pretence, that the very officials who welcomed\r\nus as honoured guests probably cursed our race as soon\r\nas our backs were turned, and that if the people had not understood\r\nfrom the presence of troops and from the magistrates'\r\nmarked personal attentions that we were not to be molested,\r\nwe might have met with violence in a dozen places. The\r\nopinions of such experienced men were not to be lightly set\r\naside.\r\n\r\nAll I can say is that on these suppositions the Chinese are\r\nmasters of the art of dissimulation, for in all our journeyings\r\nthrough the very heart of the region where the Boxers originated,\r\nand where the anti-foreign hatred was said to be bitterest,\r\nwe saw not a sign of unfriendliness. The typical official received\r\nus with the courtesy of a ``gentleman of the old school.''\r\nThe vast throngs that quickly assembled at every stopping\r\nplace, while silent, were respectful. We tried to behave decently\r\nourselves, to speak kindly to every man, to pay fair\r\nprices for what we bought; in short, to act just as we would\r\nhave acted in America. And every man to whom we smiled,\r\nsmiled in return. Wherever we asked a civil question we got\r\na civil answer. Coolies would stop their barrows, farmers\r\nleave their fields to direct us aright. In all our travelling in\r\nthe interior, amid a population so dense that we constantly\r\nmarvelled, we never heard a rude word or saw a hostile sign.\r\nI naturally find it difficult to believe that those pleasant,\r\nobliging people would have killed us if they had not been restrained\r\nby their magistrates, and that the officials who exerted\r\nthemselves to show us all possible honour would have gladly\r\nmurdered us if they had dared.\r\n\r\nAnd yet less than a year before, the Chinese had angrily destroyed\r\nthe property and venomously sought the lives of foreigners\r\nwho were as peaceably disposed as we were, ruthlessly\r\nhunting men and women who had never done them wrong, and\r\nwho had devoted their lives to teaching the young and healing\r\nthe sick and preaching the gospel of love and good will. Why\r\nthey did this we shall have occasion to observe in a later\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nThe Commercial Force and the Economic\r\nRevolution\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nWORLD CONDITIONS THAT ARE AFFECTING CHINA[20]\r\n\r\n\r\n[20] Part of this chapter appeared as an article in the American Monthly\r\nReview of Reviews, October, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVERAL outside forces have pressed steadily and heavily\r\nupon the exclusiveness and conservatism of the\r\nChinese, and though they have not yet succeeded in\r\nchanging the essential character of the nation, they have set\r\nin motion vast movements which have already convulsed great\r\nsections of the Empire and which are destined to affect stupendous\r\ntransformations. The first of these forces is foreign\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nTo understand the operation of this force, we must consider\r\nthat its impact has been enormously increased by the extension\r\nof facilities for intercommunication. The extent to which these\r\nhave revolutionized the world is one of the most extraordinary\r\nfeatures of our extraordinary age. It is startlingly significant\r\nof the change that has taken place that Russia and Japan, nations\r\n7,000 miles apart by land and a still greater distance by\r\nwater, are able in the opening years of the twentieth century\r\nto wage war in a region which one army can reach in four\r\nweeks and the other in four days, and that all the rest of the\r\nworld can receive daily information as to the progress of the\r\nconflict. A half century ago, Russia could no more have sent\r\na large army to Manchuria than to the moon, while down to\r\nthe opening of her ports by Commodore Perry in 1854, the few\r\nwooden vessels that made the long journey to Japan found an\r\nunprogressive and bitterly anti-foreign heathen nation with an\r\nedict issued in 1638 still on its statute books declaring--``So\r\nlong as the sun shall continue to warm the earth, let no Christian\r\nbe so bold as to come to Japan; and let all know that the\r\nKing of Spain himself, or the Christian's God, or the great God\r\nof all, if He dare violate this command, shall pay for it with\r\nhis head.''\r\n\r\nNor were other far-eastern peoples any more hospitable.\r\nChina, save for a few port cities, was as impenetrable as when\r\nin 1552 the dying Xavier had cried--``O Rock, Rock, when\r\nwilt thou open!'' Siam excluded all foreigners until the century's\r\nfirst quarter had passed, and Laos saw no white man till\r\n1868. A handful of British traders were so greedily determined\r\nto keep all India as a private commercial preserve that,\r\nforgetting their own indebtedness to Christianity, they sneered\r\nat the proposal to send missionaries to India as ``the maddest,\r\nmost expensive, most unwarranted project ever proposed by a\r\nlunatic enthusiast,'' while as late as 1857, a director of the\r\nEast India Company declared that ``he would rather see a band\r\nof devils in India than a band of missionaries.'' Korea was\r\nrightly called ``the hermit nation'' until 1882; and as for\r\nAfrica, it was not till 1873 that the world learned of that part\r\nof it in which the heroic Livingstone died on his knees, not till\r\n1877 that Stanley staggered into a West Coast settlement after\r\na desperate journey of 999 days from Zanzibar through Central\r\nAfrica, not till 1884 that the Berlin Conference formed the\r\nInternational Association of the Congo guaranteeing that which\r\nhas not yet been realized ``liberty of conscience'' and ``the\r\nfree and public exercise of every creed.''\r\n\r\nEven in America within the memory of men still living, the\r\nlumbering, white-topped ``prairie schooner'' was the only\r\nconveyance for the tedious overland journey to California.\r\nHardy frontiersmen were fighting Indians in the Mississippi\r\nValley, and the bold Whitman was ``half a year'' in bearing a\r\nmessage from Oregon to Washington.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. John W. Foster tells us in his ``Century of American\r\nDiplomacy'' that ``General Lane, the first territorial governor\r\nof Oregon, left his home in Indiana, August 27, 1848,\r\nand desiring to reach his destination as soon as possible, travelling\r\noverland to San Francisco and thence by ship, reached his\r\npost on the first of March following--the journey occupying\r\nsix months. At the time our treaty of peace and independence\r\nwas signed in 1783, two stage-coaches were sufficient for all the\r\npassengers and nearly all the freight between New York and\r\nBoston.'' It is only seventy years since the Rev. John Lowrie,\r\nwith his bride and Mr. and Mrs. Reed, rode horseback from\r\nPittsburg through flooded rivers and over the Allegheny\r\nMountains to Philadelphia, whence it took them four and\r\na-half months to reach Calcutta.\r\n\r\nNor was this all, for scores of the conveniences and even\r\nnecessities of our modern life were unknown at the beginning\r\nof the nineteenth century. To get some idea of the vastness\r\nof the revolution in the conditions of living, we have but to\r\nremind ourselves that ``in the year 1800 no steamer ploughed\r\nthe waters; no locomotive traversed an inch of soil; no photographic\r\nplate had ever been kissed by sunlight; no telephone\r\nhad ever talked from town to town; steam had never driven\r\nmighty mills and electric currents had never been harnessed\r\ninto telegraph and trolley wires.''[21] ``In all the land there was no\r\npower loom, no power press, no large manufactory in textiles,\r\nwood or iron, no canal. The possibilities of electricity in\r\nlight, heat and power were unknown and unsuspected. The\r\ncotton gin had just begun its revolutionary work. Intercommunication\r\nwas difficult, the postal service slow and costly,\r\nliterature scanty and mostly of inferior quality.''[22]\r\n\r\n\r\n[21] The Rev. Dr. Theodore Cuyler.\r\n\r\n[22] Address of the Bishops of the M. E. Church, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow marvellously the application of steam as a motive\r\npower has united once widely separated regions. So swiftly\r\nhave the changes come and so quickly have we adapted ourselves\r\nto them that it is difficult to realize the magnitude of the\r\ntransformation that has been achieved. We can ride from\r\nPittsburg to Philadelphia in eight hours and to Calcutta in\r\ntwenty-two days. The journey across our own continent is no\r\nlonger marked by the ox-cart and the campfire and the bones\r\nof perished expeditions. It is simply a pleasant trip of less\r\nthan a week, and in an emergency in August, 1903, Henry P.\r\nLowe travelled from New York to Los Angeles, 3,241 miles, in\r\nseventy-three hours and twenty-one minutes. Populous states\r\ncovered with a network of railway and telegraph lines invite\r\nthe nations of the world to join them in celebrating at St.\r\nLouis the ``Purchase'' of a region which a hundred years ago\r\nwas as foreign to the American people as the Philippines now\r\nare. The Rev. Dr. Calvin Mateer, who in 1863 was six\r\nmonths in reaching Chefoo, China, on a voyage from whose\r\nhardships his wife never fully recovered, returned in a comfortable\r\njourney of one month in 1902. To-day, for all practical\r\npurposes, China is nearer New York than California once\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nNo waters are too remote for the modern steamer. Its smoke\r\ntrails across every sea and far up every navigable stream. Ten\r\nmail steamers regularly run on the Siberian Yenisei, while the\r\nObi, flowing from the snows of the Little Altai Mountains,\r\nbears 302 steam vessels on various parts of its 2,000-mile\r\njourney to the Obi Gulf on the Arctic Ocean. Stanley could\r\nnow go from Glasgow to Stanley Falls in forty-three days.\r\nAlready there are forty-six steamers on the Upper Congo.\r\nFrom Cape Town, a railway 2,000 miles long runs via Bulawayo\r\nto Beira on the Portuguese coast, while branch lines reach\r\nseveral formerly inaccessible mining and agricultural regions.\r\nJune 22, 1904, almost the whole population of Cape Town\r\ncheered the departure of the first through train for Victoria\r\nFalls, where the British Association for the Advancement of\r\nScience has been invited to meet in 1905. Uganda is reached\r\nby rail. Five hundred and eighty miles of track unite Mombasa\r\nand Victoria Nyanza. Sleeping and dining cars safely\r\nrun the 575 miles from Cairo to Khartoum where only five\r\nyears ago Lord Kitchener fought the savage hordes of the\r\nMahdi. The Englishman's dream of a railroad from Cairo to\r\nthe Cape is more than half realized, for 2,800 miles are already\r\ncompleted. In 1903, Japan had 4,237 miles of well managed\r\nrailways which in 1902 carried 111,211,208 passengers\r\n14,409,752 tons of freight. India is gridironed by 25,373\r\nmiles of steel rails which in 1901 carried 195,000,000 passengers.\r\nA railroad parallels the Burmese Irrawaddy to Bhamo and\r\nMandalay. In Siam you can ride by rail from Bangkok northward\r\nto Korat and westward to Petchaburee. The Trans-\r\nSiberian Railway now connects St. Petersburg and Peking. In\r\nKorea, the line from Chemulpho to Seoul connects with lines\r\nunder construction both southward and northward, so that ere\r\nlong one can journey by rail from Fusan on the Korean Strait\r\nto Wiju on the Yalu River. As the former is but ten hours by\r\nsea from Japan and as the latter is to form a junction with the\r\nTrans-Siberian Railway, a land journey in a sleeping car will\r\nsoon be practicable from London and Paris to the capitals of\r\nChina and Korea, and, save for the ferry across the Korean\r\nStrait, to any part of the Mikado's kingdom. The locomotive\r\nruns noisily from Jaffa to venerable Jerusalem and from Beirut\r\nover the passes of Lebanon to Damascus, the oldest city in the\r\nworld. A projected line will run from there to the Mohammedan\r\nMecca, so that soon the Moslem pilgrims will abandon\r\nthe camel for the passenger coach. Most wonderful of all is\r\nthe Anatolian Railway which is to run through the heart of\r\nAsia Minor, traversing the Karamanian plateau, the Taurus\r\nMountains and the Cilician valleys to Haran where Abraham\r\ntarried, and Nineveh where Jonah preached, and Babylon\r\nwhere Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, and Bagdad\r\nwhere Haroun-al-Raschid ruled, to Koweit on the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\nIn a single month forty-five Philadelphia engines have been\r\nordered for India. The American locomotive is to-day speeding\r\nacross the steppes of Siberia, through the valleys of Japan,\r\nacross the uplands of Burmah and around the mountainsides\r\nof South America. ``Yankee bridge-builders have cast up a\r\nhighway in the desert where the chariot of Cambyses was\r\nswallowed up by the sands. The steel of Pennsylvania spans\r\nthe Atbara, makes a road to Meroe,'' and crosses the rivers of\r\nPeru. Trains on the two imperial highways of Africa--the\r\none from Cairo to the Cape and the other from the upper Nile\r\nto the Red Sea--are to be hauled by American engines over\r\nAmerican bridges, while the ``forty centuries'' which Napoleon\r\nBonaparte said looked down from the pyramids see not the\r\nsoldiers of France, but the manufacturing agents of Europe and\r\nAmerica. Whether or not we are to have a political imperialism,\r\nwe already have an industrial imperialism.\r\n\r\nWalter J. Ballard declares[23] that the aggregate capital invested\r\nin railways at the end of 1902 was $36,850,000,000 and\r\nthat the total mileage was 532,500 distributed as follows:--\r\n                                   Miles\r\n United States ................... 202,471\r\n Europe .......................... 180,708\r\n Asia ............................  41,814\r\n South America ...................  28,654\r\n North America (Except U. S.) ....  24,032\r\n Australia .......................  15,649\r\n Africa ..........................  14,187\r\n\r\n\r\n[23] New York Sun, July 13, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\nJules Verne's story, ``Around the World in Eighty Days''\r\nwas deemed fantastic in 1873. But in 1903, James Willis\r\nSayre of Seattle, Washington, travelled completely around the\r\nworld in fifty-four days and nine hours, while the Russian\r\nMinister of Railroads issues the following schedule of\r\npossibilities when the Trans-Siberian Railroad has completed its\r\nplans:--\r\n\r\n From St. Petersburg to Vladivostok ..... 10    days\r\n ``  Vladivostok to San Francisco ....... 10     ``\r\n ``  San Francisco to New York .......... 4<1/2> ``\r\n ``  New York to Bremen ................. 7      ``\r\n ``  Bremen to St. Petersburg ........... 1<1/2> ``\r\n                                           -----\r\n     Total .............................  33 days\r\n\r\nAs for the risks incident to such a tour, it is significant that\r\nfor my own journey around the world, a conservative insurance\r\ncompany, for a consideration of only fifty dollars, guaranteed\r\nfor a year to indemnify me in case of incapacitating accident to\r\nthe extent of fifty dollars a week and in case of death to pay\r\nmy heirs $10,000. And the company made money on the\r\narrangement, for I met with neither illness nor accident. With\r\na very few unimportant exceptions, there are now no hermit\r\nnations, for the remotest lands are within quick and easy reach.\r\n\r\nAnd now electricity has ushered in an era more wondrous\r\nstill. Trolley cars run through the streets of Seoul and\r\nBangkok. The Empress Dowager of China wires her decrees\r\nto the Provincial Governors. Telegraph lines belt the globe,\r\nenabling even the provincial journal to print the news of the\r\nentire world during the preceding twenty-four hours. We\r\nknow to-day what occurred yesterday in Tokyo and Beirut,\r\nShanghai and Batanga. The total length of all telegraph\r\nlines in the world is 4,908,921 miles,--the nerves of our\r\nmodern civilization. And it is remarkable not only that\r\nEurope has 1,764,790 miles, America 2,516,548 miles and\r\nAustralia 277,419 miles, but that Africa has 99,409 miles and\r\nAsia 310,685 miles, Japan alone having, in 1903, 84,000 miles\r\nbeside 108,000 miles of telephone wires.\r\n\r\nI found the telegraph in Siam and Korea, in China and the\r\nPhilippines, in Burma, India, Arabia, Egypt and Palestine.\r\nCamping one night in far Northern Laos after a toilsome ride\r\non elephants, I realized that I was 12,500 miles from home, at\r\nas remote a point almost as it would be possible for man to\r\nreach. All about was the wilderness, relieved only by the few\r\nhouses of a small village. But walking into that tiny hamlet, I\r\nfound at the police station a telephone connecting with the\r\ntelegraph office at Chieng-mai, so that, though I was on the\r\nother side of the planet, I could have sent a telegram to my\r\nNew York office in a few minutes. Nor was this an exceptional\r\nexperience, for the telegraph is all over Laos, as indeed\r\nit is over many other Asiatic lands.\r\n\r\nFrom the recesses of Africa comes the report that the Congo\r\ntelegraph line, which will ultimately stretch across the entire\r\nbelt of Central Africa, already runs 800 miles up the Congo\r\nRiver from the ocean to Kwamouth, the junction of the\r\nKassai and Congo Rivers. A Belgian paper states that ``a\r\ntelegram dispatched from Kwamouth on January 15th was\r\ndelivered at Boma half an hour later. For the future, the\r\nKassai is thus placed in direct and rapid communication with\r\nthe seat of Government, and Europe is also brought close to the\r\ncentre of Africa. Only a few years ago, news took at least two\r\nmonths to reach Boma from the Kassai, and the reply would\r\nnot be received under another two months, and this only if the\r\nparties were available and the steamer ready to start.''\r\n\r\nMore significant still are the submarine cables which aggregate\r\n1,751 in number and over 200,000 miles in length and\r\nwhich annually transmit more than 6,000,000 messages,\r\nannihilating the time and distance which formerly separated\r\nnations. When King William IV of England died in 1837,\r\nthe news was thirty-five days in reaching America. But when\r\nQueen Victoria passed away January 22, 1901, at 6:30 P. M.,\r\nthe afternoon papers describing the event were being sold in\r\nthe streets of New York at 3:30 P. M. of the same day! As I\r\nrose to address a union meeting of the English speaking residents\r\nof Canton, China, on that fateful September day of 1901,\r\na message was handed me which read, ``President McKinley is\r\ndead.'' So that by means of the submarine cable, that little\r\ncompany of Englishmen and Americans in far-off China bowed\r\nin grief and prayer simultaneously with multitudes in the home\r\nland.\r\n\r\nNot only Europe and America, but Siberia and Australia,\r\nNew Zealand and New Caledonia, Korea and the Kameruns,\r\nLaos and Persia are within the sweep of this modern system of\r\nintercommunication. The latest as well as one of the most\r\nimportant links in this world system is the Commercial\r\nPacific Cable between Manila and San Francisco.\r\n\r\nPresident Roosevelt gave a significant illustration of the perfection\r\nof this system when, on the completion of the\r\nCommercial Pacific Cable July 4, 1903, he flashed a message\r\naround the earth in twelve minutes, while a second message\r\nsent by Clarence H. Mackay, President of the Pacific Cable\r\nCompany, made the circuit of the earth in nine minutes.\r\n\r\nWhat additional possibilities are involved in the wireless\r\nsystem of telegraphy we can only conjecture, but it is already\r\napparent that this system has passed the experimental stage\r\nand that it is destined to achieve still more amazing results. A\r\nstartling illustration of its possibilities was given by the\r\nJapanese fleet March 22, 1904. A cruiser lay off Port Arthur\r\nand by wireless messages enabled battleships, riding safely\r\neight miles away, to bombard fortifications which they could\r\nnot see and which could not see them.\r\n\r\nCommerce has taken swift and massive advantages of these\r\nfacilities for intercommunication. Its ships whiten every sea.\r\nThe products of European and American manufacture are\r\nflooding the earth. The United States Treasury Bureau of\r\nStatistics (1903) estimates that the value of the manufactured\r\narticles which enter into the international commerce of the\r\nworld is four billions of dollars and that of this vast total, the\r\nUnited States furnishes 400,000,000, its foreign trade having\r\nincreased over 100 per cent. since 1895. While the bulk of\r\nthe foreign trade of the United States is with Europe, American\r\nbusiness men are gradually awaking to the greatness of their\r\nopportunity in Asia. A characteristic example of their aggressiveness\r\nwas given when President James J. Hill, of the Great\r\nNorthern Railroad, testified before a Government Commission,\r\nOctober 20, 1902:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``We arranged with a line of steamers to connect with our road so that\r\nwe could get the Oriental outlet. I remember when the Japanese were\r\ngoing to buy rails, I asked them where they were going to buy, and they\r\nsaid in England or Belgium. I asked them to wait until I telegraphed.\r\nI wired and made the rates, so that we made the price $1.50 a ton lower\r\nand sold for America 40,000 tons of rails. Then I got them to try a little\r\nof the American cotton, telling them if it was not satisfactory I would pay\r\nfor the cotton, and the result was satisfactory.''\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these ways, the interrelation of nations is becoming\r\ncloser and closer, their separation from the world's life more\r\nand more difficult. Dr. Josiah Strong well observes:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``Until the nineteenth century, there was but little contact between\r\ndifferent peoples throughout the world. They were separated, not only\r\nby distances hard to overcome, but by differences of speech, of faith, of\r\nmental habit and mode of life, of custom and costume, of government and\r\nlaw, and isolation tended steadily to emphasize the divergence which already\r\nexisted. Thus increasing differences of environment perpetuated\r\nand intensified the differences of civilization which they had created. In\r\nother words, until the nineteenth century, the stream of tendency down\r\nall the ages was towards diversity. Then came the change, the results\r\nof which are, in their magnitude and importance, beyond calculation.\r\nSteam annihilated nine-tenths of space, and electricity has cancelled the\r\nremainder. Isolation is, therefore, becoming impossible, for the world is\r\nnow a neighbourhood. This means that differences of environment will,\r\nfrom this time on, become constantly less. The swift ships of commerce\r\nare mighty shuttles which are weaving the nations together into one great\r\nweb of life.''\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE ECONOMIC REVOLUTION IN ASIA[24]\r\n\r\nTHE result of the operation of this commercial force is\r\nan economic revolution of vast proportions. When\r\never I went in Asia, I found wider interest in this subject\r\nthan in the aggressions of European nations. The reason\r\nis obvious. The common people in Asia care little for politics,\r\nbut the price of food and raiment touches every man, woman\r\nand child at a sensitive point. Almost everywhere, the old\r\ndays of cheap living are passing away. Steamers, railways,\r\ntelegraphs, newspapers, labour-saving machinery, and the introduction\r\nof western ideas are slowly but surely revolutionizing\r\nthe Orient. Shantung wheat, which formerly had no market\r\nbeyond a radius of a few dozen miles from the wheat-field, can\r\nnow be shipped by railroad and steamship to any part of the\r\nworld, and every Chinese buyer has to pay more for it in consequence.\r\nIn like manner new facilities for export have doubled,\r\ntrebled and, in some places, quadrupled the price of rice in\r\nChina, Siam and Japan. The Consul-General of the United\r\nStates at Shanghai reports that the prices of seventeen staple\r\narticles of export have increased sixteen per cent. in twenty\r\nyears while in Japan the increase in the same articles for the\r\nsame period was thirty-one per cent.[25]\r\n\r\n\r\n[24] Part of this chapter appeared as an article in the Century Magazine,\r\nMarch, 1904.\r\n[25] ``Commercial China,'' p. 2902.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe depreciation in the value of silver has still further complicated\r\nthe situation. The common Chinese tael, which formerly\r\nbought from 1,500 to 1,800 cash (the current coin of\r\nChina), now buys only 950 cash. The Shanghai tael brings\r\n897 cash, and the Mexican dollar only 665. This of course,\r\nmeans that the common people, who use only cash, have to pay\r\na larger number of them for the necessaries of life. The same\r\ndifficulty is being felt to a greater or less extent in many other\r\ncountries of Asia, while in China, an already serious advance\r\nin prices is being heightened by the heavy import taxes which\r\nhave been levied to meet the indemnity imposed by the Western\r\nPowers on account of the Boxer outbreak.\r\n\r\nThe prices of labour and materials have sharply advanced in\r\nconsequence of the enormous demands incident to the construction\r\nof railways, with their stations, shops and round-houses,\r\nthe vast engineering schemes of the Germans at Tsing-tau, the\r\nBritish at Wei-hai Wei and the Russians at Port Arthur, the\r\nextensive scale on which the Legations have rebuilt in Peking,\r\nthe reconstruction of virtually the entire business portions of\r\nboth Peking and Tien-tsin, as well as the coincident rebuilding\r\nof the mission stations of all denominations, Protestant and\r\nCatholic. It will be readily understood what all this activity\r\nmeans in a land where there are as yet but limited supplies of\r\nthe kind of skilled labourers required for foreign buildings, and\r\nwhere the requisite materials must be imported from Europe\r\nand America by firms who ``are not in China for their health.''\r\n\r\nIt is futile to hope that the competition will be materially less\r\nnext year, or the year after, or the year after that. Commerce\r\nand politics are planning works in China which will not be completed\r\nfor many years. Railway officials told me of projected\r\nlines which will require decades for construction. China has\r\nentered upon an era of commercial development. The Western\r\nworld has come to stay, and while there may be temporary\r\nreactions, as there have been at home, prices are not likely to\r\nreturn to their former level. There are vast interior regions\r\nwhich will not be affected for an indefinite period, but for the\r\ncoast provinces, primitive conditions are passing forever.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of modern inventions and of other foods\r\nand articles has created new wants. The Chinese peasant is no\r\nlonger content to burn bean oil; he wants kerosene. In\r\nscores of humble Laos homes and markets I saw American\r\nlamps costing twenty rupees apiece, and a magistrate proudly\r\nshowed me a collection of nineteen of these shining articles.\r\nForty thousand dollars worth of these lamps were sold in Siam\r\nlast year. The narrow streets of Canton are brilliant with German\r\nchandeliers and myriads of private houses throughout the\r\nEmpire are lighted by foreign lamps. The desire of the\r\nAsiatic to possess foreign lamps is only equalled by his passion\r\nfor foreign clocks. I counted twenty-seven in the private\r\napartments of the Emperor of China and my wife counted\r\nnineteen in a single room of the Empress Dowager's palace,\r\nwhile cheaper ones tick to the delighted wonder of myriads of\r\nhumbler people. The ambitious Syrian scorns the mud roof\r\nof his ancestors and will only be satisfied with bright red tiles\r\nimported from France. In almost every Asiatic city I visited,\r\nI found shops crowded with articles of foreign manufacture.\r\n``Made in Germany'' is as familiar a phrase in Siam as in\r\nAmerica. Many children in China are arrayed only in the atmosphere,\r\nbut when I was in Taian-fu, in the far interior of\r\nShantung, hundreds of parents were in consternation because\r\nthe magistrate had just placarded the walls with an edict announcing\r\nthat hereafter boys and girls must wear clothes and\r\nthat they would be arrested if found on the streets naked. At\r\na banquet given to the foreign ministers by the Emperor and\r\nthe Empress Dowager in the famous Summer Palace twelve\r\nmiles from Peking, the distinguished guests cut York ham with\r\nSheffield knives and drank French wines out of German glasses.\r\nEverywhere articles of foreign manufacture are in demand,\r\nand shrewd Chinese merchants are stocking their shops with\r\nincreasing quantities of European and American goods. The\r\nnew Chinese Presbyterian Church at Wei-hsien typifies the elements\r\nthat are entering Asia for it contains Chinese brick,\r\nOregon fir beams, German steel binding-plates and rods, Belgian\r\nglass, Manchurian pine pews, and British cement.\r\n\r\nIndia is eagerly buying American rifles, tools, boots and\r\nshoes, while vast regions which depend upon irrigation are becoming\r\ninterested in American well-boring outfits. Persia is\r\ndemanding increasing quantities of American padlocks, sewing-\r\nmachines and agricultural implements. German, English and\r\nAmerican machinery is equipping great cotton factories in\r\nJapan. I saw Russian and American oil tins in the remotest\r\nvillages of Korea. Strolling along the river bank one evening\r\nin Paknampo, Siam, I heard a familiar whirring sound and\r\nentering found a bare-legged Siamese busily at work on a sewing-\r\nmachine of American make. Nearly five hundred of them\r\nare sold in Siam every year, and I found them in most of the\r\ncities that I visited in other Asiatic countries. When I left\r\nLampoon on an elephant, six hundred miles north of Bangkok,\r\na Laos gentleman rode beside me for several miles on an American\r\nbicycle. There are thousands of them in Siam. His\r\nMajesty himself frequently rides one and His Royal Highness,\r\nPrince Damrong, is president of a bicycle club of four hundred\r\nmembers. The king's palace is lighted by electricity and the\r\nGovernment buildings are equipped with telephones, and as the\r\nnobles and merchants see the brilliancy of the former and the\r\nconvenience of the latter, they want them, too. In many\r\nparts of Asia people, who but a decade or two ago were satisfied\r\nwith the crudest appliances of primitive life, are now\r\nlearning to use steam and electrical machinery, to like Oregon\r\nflour, Chicago beef, Pittsburg pickles and London jam, and to\r\nsee the utility of foreign wire, nails, cutlery, drugs, paints and\r\nchemicals.\r\n\r\nMany other illustrations of a changed condition might be\r\ncited. Knowledge increases wants and the Oriental is acquiring\r\nknowledge. He demands a hundred things to-day that his\r\ngrandfather never heard of, and when he goes to the shops to\r\nbuy his daily food, he finds that the new market for it which\r\nthe foreigner has opened has increased the price.\r\n\r\nAmericans are the very last people who can consistently\r\ncriticise this tendency in Asia. It is the foreigner who has\r\ncreated it, and the American is the most prodigal of all foreigners.\r\nI never realized until I visited other lands how extravagant\r\nis the scale of American life, not only among the\r\nrich, but the so-called poor. My morning walk to my New\r\nYork office takes me along Christopher Street, and I have often\r\nseen in the garbage cans of tenement houses pieces of bread\r\nand meat and half-eaten vegetables and fruit that would give\r\nthe average Asiatic the feast of a lifetime. In Europe, Americans\r\nare notorious as spendthrifts. In the Philippine Islands,\r\nthey have thrown about their money in a way which has inaugurated\r\nan era of reckless lavishness comparable only to the\r\nCalifornia days of ``forty-nine.'' In the port cities of China,\r\nthe porters asked me extortionate prices because I was an\r\nAmerican. Two or three coolies would seize a suit case or\r\nchange it from man to man every few minutes, on the pretense\r\nthat it was heavy. In Tien-tsin, you hire a jinrikisha and\r\npresently you find a second man pushing behind, though the\r\nroad is smooth as a floor. In a few minutes a third appears to\r\npush on the other side, and once a fourth took hold between\r\nthe second and third. All of course demand pay, and it is\r\ndifficult to shake them off. They do not understand your protests,\r\nor they pretend not to, and you have to be emphatic to\r\nget rid of them. At Tong-ku, my sampan men calmly insisted\r\non two dollars for a service that was worth but forty cents.\r\nEverywhere, I found that it was wiser to make all purchases\r\nand bargains through trusty native Christians, or to ascertain\r\nin advance what a given service was really worth, pay it and\r\nwalk off, deaf to all protestations and complaints, even though\r\nas in Seoul, Korea, the men plaintively sat around for hours.\r\nIn Cairo, a certain hotel charged me on the supposition that\r\nbecause I was an American, I was a millionaire or a fool--perhaps\r\nboth. True, we have hack-drivers and hotel-keepers in\r\nAmerica who are equally rapacious, and a New Yorker in particular\r\nneed not go away from home to be overcharged. But\r\nit is just because we have become so accustomed to this careless\r\nprofusion at home that we exhibit it abroad.\r\n\r\nBut it is useless to protest against the increased cost of living\r\nin Asia. It is as much beyond individual control as the tides.\r\nThe causes which are producing it are not even national but\r\ncosmopolitan.\r\n\r\nNor should we ignore the fact that this movement is, in\r\nsome respects at least, beneficial. It means a higher and\r\nbroader scale of life and such a life always costs more than a\r\nlow and narrow one. This economic revolution in Asia is a\r\nconcomitant of a Christian civilization which brings not only\r\nhigher prices but wider intellectual and spiritual horizons, a\r\ngeneral enlarging and uplifting of the whole range of life.\r\nThere are indeed some vicious influences accompanying this\r\nmovement, as brighter lights usually have deeper shadows.\r\n\r\nBut surely it is for good and not for evil that the farmers of\r\nHunan can now ship their peanuts to England and with the\r\nproceeds vary the eternal monotony of a rice-diet; that the\r\ngirls of Siam are being taught by missionary example that\r\nmodesty requires the purchase of a garment for street wear\r\nwhich will cover at least the breasts; that the Korean should\r\nlearn that it is better to have a larger house so that the girls of\r\nthe family need not sleep in the same room as the boys; and\r\nthat all China should discover the advantages of roads over\r\nrutty, corkscrew paths, of sanitation over heaps of putrid garbage\r\nand of wooden floors over filth-encrusted ground. Christianity\r\ninevitably involves some of these things, and to some\r\nextent the awakening of Asia to the need of them is a part of\r\nthe beneficent influence of a gospel which always and everywhere\r\nrenders men dissatisfied with a narrow, squalid existence.\r\nTo make a man decent morally is to beget in him a\r\ndesire to be decent physically.\r\n\r\nThe native Christians, especially the pastors and teachers,\r\nare the very ones who first feel this movement towards a\r\nhigher physical life. Nor should we repress it in them, for it\r\nmeans an environment more favourable to morals and to the\r\nstability of Christian character as well as a healthful example\r\nto the community in which they live. To say, therefore, that\r\nthe average annual income of a Hindu is rupees twenty-seven\r\n(nine dollars) is not to adduce a reason for holding the pastors\r\nand evangelists of India down to that scale. They should, indeed,\r\nlive near enough to the plane of their countrymen to keep\r\nin sympathetic touch with them. But they should not be expected\r\nor allowed to huddle in the dark, unventilated hovels of\r\nthe masses of the people, or, by confining themselves to one\r\nscanty meal a day, have that gaunt, half-famished look which\r\nmakes my heart ache every time I think of the walking skeletons\r\nI saw in India. I am not ashamed but proud of the fact\r\nthat it costs the average Christian more to live in Asia than it\r\ncosts the average heathen, that the houses of the Laos Christians\r\nare better than the single-roomed sheds about them, that\r\nthe graduates of our Siam mission schools for girls wear shirt\r\nwaists instead of sunshine, that the members of any one of our\r\nKorean churches spend more money on soap than a whole village\r\nof their heathen neighbours whose bodies are caked with\r\nthe accumulations of years of neglect, that the sessions of our\r\nSyrian churches are Christian gentlemen in appearance as well\r\nas in fact, and that the houses of our Chinese Christians do not\r\nmix pigs, chickens and babies in one lousy, malodorous\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nBut these altered conditions have not yet brought the ability\r\nto meet them. The cost of living has increased faster than the\r\nresources of the people. Only France and Russia are primarily\r\npolitical in their foreign policy. England, Germany and\r\nthe United States are avowedly commercial. They talk incessantly\r\nabout ``the open door.'' Their supreme object in Asia\r\nis to ``extend their markets.'' They are producing more than\r\nthey can use themselves, and they seek an opportunity to dispose\r\nof their surplus products. They are less concerned to\r\nbring the products of Asia into their own territories.\r\nIndeed, Germany and particularly the United States have\r\nbuilt a tariff wall about themselves, expressly to protect\r\nhome industries from outside competition, and not a few\r\nAmerican manufacturers have recently been on the verge of\r\npanic on account of Japanese competition. Europe and America\r\nare trying to force their own manufactures on to Asia and\r\nto take in return only what they please.\r\n\r\nIn time, this will probably right itself, in part at least.\r\nWhile the farmers of the Mississippi Valley find living much\r\nmore expensive than it was two generations ago, they also find\r\nthat they get more for their wheat and that they eat better food\r\nand wear better clothes and build better houses than their\r\ngrandfathers. The era of railroads ended the days of cheap\r\nliving, but it ended as well days when the farmer had to confine\r\nhimself to a diet of corn-bread and salt pork, when his\r\nhome was destitute of comforts and his children had little\r\nschooling and no books. So the American working man of today\r\nhas to pay more for the necessaries of life than the working\r\nman of Europe, but he is nevertheless the best paid, the\r\nbest fed, the best clothed and the best housed working man in\r\nthe world, a far better and more intelligent citizen because of\r\nthese very conditions.\r\n\r\nThe same changes will doubtless take place in Asia. That\r\ngreat continent is capable of producing enormous quantities of\r\nfood, minerals and both raw and manufactured articles which\r\nthe rest of the world will sooner or later want. Already this\r\nforeign demand is bringing comparative wealth to the rug\r\ndealers of Syria, the silk embroiderers of China and the cloisonne'\r\nand porcelain makers of Japan. But only an infinitesimal\r\npart of the total population has thus far profited largely by\r\nthis wider market. Where one man amasses wealth in this\r\nway, 100,000 men find that aggressive foreign traders exploit\r\ntheir wares by flooding the shops with tempting articles which\r\nthey can ill-afford to buy. The difficulty is rapidly becoming\r\nacute. My inquiries in Japan led me to the conclusion that\r\nwhile the cost of the staple articles of living has increased\r\nnearly 100 per cent. in the last twenty years, the financial ability\r\nof the average Japanese has not increased thirty per cent.\r\nIn China, Siam, India, the Philippine Islands, and Syria I\r\nfound substantially similar anxieties though the proportions\r\nnaturally varied. ``True, there has been commerce since the\r\nearly ages, but caravans could afford to carry only precious\r\ngoods, like fine fabrics, spices and gems. These luxuries did\r\nnot reach the multitude, and could not materially change environment.\r\nBut modern commerce scatters over all the world\r\nthe products of every climate, in ever increasing quantities.''\r\n\r\nSo the economic revolution in Asia is characterized, as such\r\nrevolutions usually are in Europe and America, by wide-spread\r\nunrest and, in some places, by violence. The oldest of continents\r\nis the latest to undergo the throes of the stupendous\r\ntransformation from which the newest is slowly beginning to\r\nemerge. The transition period in Asia will be longer and perhaps\r\nmore trying, as the numbers involved are vaster and more\r\nconservative; but the ultimate result cannot fail to be beneficial\r\nboth to Asia and to the whole world.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore too late to discuss the question whether the\r\ncharacter and religions of these nations should be disturbed.\r\nThey have already been disturbed by the inrush of new ideas\r\nand by the ways as well as by the products of the white man.\r\nLike their ancient temples, the religions of Asia are cracking\r\nfrom pinnacle to foundation. The natives themselves realize\r\nthat the old days are passing forever. India is in a ferment.\r\nJapan has leaped to world prominence. The power of the\r\nMahdi has been broken and the Soudan has been opened to\r\ncivilization. The King of Siam has made Sunday a legal holiday\r\nand is frightening his conservative subjects by his revolutionary\r\nchanges, while Korea is changing with kaleidoscopic\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\nWhereas the opening years of the sixteenth century saw the\r\nstruggle for civilization, of the seventeenth century for religious\r\nliberty, of the eighteenth century for constitutional government,\r\nof the nineteenth century for political freedom, the\r\nopening years of the twentieth century witness what Lowell\r\nwould have called:--\r\n\r\n ``One death-grapple in the darkness 'twixt\r\n Old systems and the word.''\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nFOREIGN TRADE AND FOREIGN VICES\r\n\r\nTHE influences that are thus surging into the Middle\r\nKingdom are tremendous. The beginnings of China's\r\nforeign trade date back to the third century, though\r\nit was not until comparatively recent years that it grew to large\r\nproportions. To-day the leading seaports of China have many\r\ngreat business houses handling vast quantities of European and\r\nAmerican goods. The most persistent effort is made to extend\r\ncommerce with the Chinese. That the effort is successful is\r\nshown by the fact that the foreign trade of China increased\r\nfrom 217,183,960 taels in 1888 to 583,547,291 taels in 1904.\r\nThis shows the enormous gain of 168 per cent., though this is\r\nslightly modified by the fact that the report for 1904 includes\r\ngoods to the value of 402,639 taels carried by Chinese vessels\r\nwhich, though plying between native and foreign ports, were\r\nnot formerly reported through the customs. According to\r\nofficial reports,[26] the foreign trade of China has been growing\r\nrapidly during recent years, the only falling off having been\r\nin the Boxer outbreak year 1900. In 1891, the imports into\r\nChina were, in round numbers, 134,000,000 taels and the\r\nexports were 101,000,000, a total of 235,000,000, and an\r\nexcess of imports of 33 per cent. In 1904 the imports had\r\nadvanced to 344,060,608 taels and the exports to 239,486,683\r\ntaels, a total of 583,547,291 taels, an increase of 148 per cent.\r\nand an excess of imports of 44 per cent. In 1899 the total\r\nforeign trade of China had reached 460,000,000 taels. The\r\nnext year it dropped to 370,000,000 taels, but in 1901 it sprang\r\nto 438,000,000 taels, and has advanced nearly 150,000,000\r\ntaels within the past three years.[27]\r\n\r\n\r\n[26] ``Returns of Trade for 1904,'' published by the Maritime Customs\r\nDepartment of China.\r\n\r\n[27] ``Returns of Trade for 1904,'' published by the Maritime Customs\r\nDepartment of China.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe share of the United States is larger than one might infer\r\nfrom the reports, as no inconsiderable part of our trade goes to\r\nChina by way of England and Hongkong and is often credited to\r\nthe British total instead of to ours. American trade has, moreover,\r\nrapidly increased since 1900. We now sell more cotton\r\ngoods to China than to all other countries combined, the exports\r\nhaving increased from $5,195,845 in 1898 to $27,000,000\r\nin 1905.[28] In the year 1904, 63,529,623 gallons of kerosene\r\noil valued at $7,202,110 were shipped from the United States\r\nto China. The development of the flour trade has been extraordinary,\r\nthe sales having risen from $89,305 in 1898 to\r\n$5,360,139 in 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n[28] Year ending June, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Hongkong, I found American flour controlling the\r\nmarket. I learned on inquiry that years before, a firm in\r\nPortland, Oregon, had sent an agent to introduce its flour.\r\nThe rice-eating Chinese did not want it, but the agent stayed,\r\ngave away samples, explained its use and pushed his goods so\r\nenergetically and persistently that after years of labour and the\r\nexpenditure of tens of thousands of dollars a market was created.\r\nNow that firm sells in such enormous quantities that its\r\nnumerous mills must run day and night to supply the demand,\r\nand the annual profits run into six figures. That city of Portland\r\nalone exported to Asia, chiefly China, in 1903:--\r\n   849,360 barrels flour        $2,974,620\r\n   522,887 bushels wheat           413,901\r\n   46,847,975 feet lumber          647,355\r\n   Miscellaneous merchandise       352,879\r\n                                   -------\r\n     Total                      $4,414,651\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile cotton goods, kerosene oil and flour are our chief exports\r\nto China, there is a growing demand for many other\r\nAmerican products. The utility of the American locomotive\r\nhas become so apparent that in 1899, engines costing $732,212\r\nwere sent to China and additional orders are received every\r\nfew months. With the enormous forests bordering the Pacific\r\nOcean in the states of Oregon and Washington, and with the\r\ndevelopment of cheap water transportation, there is a rapidly\r\nwidening market in China for American lumber. Eastern Asia\r\nis too densely peopled to have large forests, and those she has\r\nare not within easy reach. Native lumber, therefore, is scarce\r\nand often small and crooked. That in common use comes\r\nfrom Manchuria and Korea. I was impressed in Tsing-tau to\r\nfind that the Germans are using Oregon lumber and to be told\r\nthat it is considered the best, and in the long run, the cheapest.\r\nOregon pine costs more than the Korean and Manchurian, but\r\nit is superior in size and quality. The transportation charges\r\nto the interior, however, are a heavy addition. Manchurian\r\npine can be delivered at such an interior city as Wei-hsien, via\r\nthe junk port of Yang-chia-ko and thence by land, for twenty\r\ndollars, gold, per thousand square feet, which is considerably\r\nless than the Tsing-tau retail price for Asiatic lumber. Oregon\r\nlumber costs in Shanghai, thirty-two dollars gold, per thousand,\r\nbut an importer estimated that it could be delivered at Tsingtau\r\nfor twenty-five dollars gold per thousand in large quantities.\r\n\r\nThe exports of the United States to China, according to the\r\nreports of Consul-General Goodnow of Shanghai, increased\r\nfrom $11,081,146 in 1900 to $18,175,484 in 1901 and $22,698,282\r\nin 1902, while for 1904 they reached the total of about\r\n$24,000,000, a gain of nearly 125 per cent. since 1900 and of\r\nseveral hundred per cent. as compared with 1894.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the United States imported from China goods to\r\nthe value of $30,872,244 in 1904, which is an increase of $14,255,956\r\nover the imports for 1901. Silk and tea are the principal\r\nitems in this trade, the figures for the former being $10,220,543\r\nand for the latter $7,294,570, though of goatskins we\r\ntook $2,556,541, wool $2,325,445, and matting $1,615,838.\r\nThe United States is now the third nation in trade relations\r\nwith China. This is the more remarkable when we consider\r\nthe statement of the late Mr. Everett Frazar of the American\r\nAsiatic Association that in January, 1901, there were only four\r\nAmerican business firms in all China. When our business men\r\nestablish their own houses in China instead of dealing as now\r\nthrough European and Chinese firms, it is not unreasonable to\r\nexpect that the United States will outstrip its larger rivals Great\r\nBritain and France, though, as I have already intimated, it is\r\none thing to ship foreign goods to China and quite another\r\nthing to control them after their arrival, for the Chinese are\r\ndisposed to manage that trade themselves and they know how\r\nto do it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the stream of foreign trade with China has\r\nbeen contaminated by many of the vices which disgrace our\r\ncivilization. The pioneer traders were, as a rule, pirates and\r\nadventurers, who cheated and abused the Chinese most flagrantly.\r\nGorst says that ``rapine, murder and a constant appeal\r\nto force chiefly characterized the commencement of Europe's\r\ncommercial intercourse with China.'' There are many\r\nmen of high character engaged in business in the great cities\r\nof China. I would not speak any disparaging word of those\r\nwho are worthy of all respect. But it is all too evident that\r\n``many Americans and Europeans doing business in Asia are\r\nliving the life of the prodigal son who has not yet come to himself.''\r\nProfane, intemperate, immoral, not living among the\r\nChinese, but segregating themselves in foreign communities in\r\nthe treaty ports, not speaking the Chinese language, frequently\r\nbeating and cursing those who are in their employ, regarding\r\nthe Chinese with hatred and contempt,--it is no wonder that\r\nthey are hated in return and that their conduct has done much\r\nto justify the Chinese distrust of the foreigner. The foreign\r\nsettlements in the port cities of China are notorious for their\r\nprofligacy. Intemperance and immorality, gambling and Sabbath\r\ndesecration run riot. When after his return from a long\r\njourney in Asia, the Rev. Dr. George Pentecost was asked--\r\n``What are the darkest spots in the missionary outlook?'' he\r\nreplied:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``In lands of spiritual darkness, it is difficult to speak of `darkest\r\nspots.' I should say, however, that if there is a darkness more dark\r\nthan other darkness, it is that which is cast into heathen darkness\r\nby the ungodliness of the American and European communities that\r\nhave invaded the East for the sake of trade and empire. The corruption\r\nof Western godliness is the worst evil in the East. Of course there are\r\nnoble exceptions among western commercial men and their families, but\r\nas a rule the European and American resident in the East is a constant\r\ncontradiction to all and everything which the missionary stands for.''\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the criticisms of missionaries which find their way\r\ninto the daily papers emanate from such men. The missionaries\r\ndo not gamble or drink whiskey, nor will their wives and\r\ndaughters attend or reciprocate entertainments at which wine,\r\ncards and dancing are the chief features. So, of course, the\r\nmissionaries are ``canting hypocrites,'' and are believed to be\r\ndoing no good, because the foreigner who has never visited a\r\nChinese Christian Church, school or hospital in his life, does\r\nnot see the evidences of missionary work in his immediate\r\nneighbourhood. The editor of the Japan Daily Mail justly\r\nsays:--[29]\r\n\r\n\r\n[29] April 7, 1901\r\n\r\n\r\n``We do not suggest that these newspapers which denounce the missionaries\r\nso vehemently desire to be unjust or have any suspicion that they\r\nare unjust. But we do assert that they have manifestly taken on the colour\r\nof that section of every far eastern community whose units, for some\r\nstrange reason, entertain an inveterate prejudice against the missionary\r\nand his works. Were it possible for these persons to give an intelligent\r\nexplanation of the dislike with which the missionary inspires them, their\r\nopinions would command more respect. But they have never succeeded\r\nin making any logical presentment of their case, and no choice offers except\r\nto regard them as the victims of an antipathy which has no basis in\r\nreason or reflection, That a man should be anti-Christian and should de-\r\nvote his pen to propagating his views is strictly within his right, and we\r\nmust not be understood as suggesting that the smallest reproach attaches\r\nto such a person. But on the other hand, it is within the right of the\r\nmissionary to protest against being arraigned before judges habitually hostile\r\nto him, and it is within the right of the public to scrutinize the\r\npronouncements of such judges with much suspicion.''\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Darwin did not hesitate to put the matter more\r\nbluntly still. He will surely not be deemed a prejudiced witness,\r\nbut he plainly said of the traders and travellers who attack\r\nmissionaries:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``It is useless to argue against such reasoners. I believe that,\r\ndisappointed in not finding the field of licentiousness quite so open as\r\nformerly, they will not give credit to a morality which they do not wish to\r\npractice, or to a religion which they undervalue or despise.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThese facts are a suggestive commentary on the popular notion\r\nthat civilization should precede Christianity. The Rev. Dr.\r\nJames Stewart, the veteran missionary of South Africa, says that\r\nit is an ``unpleasant and startling statement, unfortunately\r\ntrue, that contact with European nations seems always to have\r\nresulted in further deterioration of the African races. . . .\r\nTrade and commerce have been on the West Coast of Africa\r\nfor more than three centuries. What have they made of that\r\nregion? Some of its tribes are more hopeless, more sunken\r\nmorally and socially, and rapidly becoming more commercially\r\nvalueless, than any tribes that may be found throughout the\r\nwhole of the continent. Mere commercial influence by its example\r\nor its teaching during all that time has had little effect\r\non the cruelty and reckless shedding of blood and the human\r\nsacrifices of the besotted paganism which still exists near that\r\ncoast.'' Of his experience in New Guinea, James Chalmers\r\ndeclared:--``I have had twenty-one years' experience among\r\nnatives. I have lived with the Christian native, and I have\r\nlived, and dined, and slept with cannibals. But I have never\r\nyet met with a single man or woman, or with a single people,\r\nthat civilization without Christianity has civilized.''\r\n\r\nSubstantially similar statements might be made regarding\r\nother lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n``The more we open the world to what we call civilization, and the more\r\neducation we give it of the kind we call scientific, the greater are the\r\ndangers to modern society, unless in some way we contrive to make all\r\nthe world better. Brigands armed with repeating rifles and supplied with\r\nsmokeless gunpowder are brigands still, but ten times more dangerous than\r\nbefore. The vaste hordes of human beings in Asia and Africa, so long as\r\nthey are left in seclusion, are dangerous to their immediate neighbours;\r\nbut, when they have railroads, steamboats, tariffs, and machine guns, while\r\nthey retain their savage ideals and barbarous customs, they become dangerous\r\nto all the rest of the world.''[30]\r\n\r\n[30] Christian Register, December 3, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Christless civilization is always and everywhere a curse\r\nrather than a blessing. From the Garden of Eden down, the\r\nfall of man has resulted from ``the increase of knowledge and\r\nof power unaccompanied by reverence.... No evolution\r\nis stable which neglects the moral factor or seeks to shake\r\nitself free from the eternal duties of obedience and of faith.\r\n. . . The Song of Lamech echoes from a remote antiquity\r\nthe savage truth that `the first results of civilization are to\r\nequip hatred and render revenge more deadly, . . . a\r\nsavage exultation in the fresh power of vengeance which all the\r\nnovel instruments have placed in their inventor's hands.' ''[31]\r\n\r\n\r\n[31] The Rev. Dr. George Adam Smith, D. D., ``Yale Lectures,'' pp. 95-97.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is civilization without the gospel? The essential elements\r\nof our civilization are the fruits of Christianity, and the\r\ntree cannot be transplanted without its roots. Can a railroad\r\nor a plow convert a man? They can add to his material comfort;\r\nthey can enlarge the opportunities of the gospel, but are\r\nthey the gospel itself? What does civilization without Christianity\r\nmean? It means the lust of the European and American\r\nsoldiers which is rotting the native Hawaiians, the European and\r\nAmerican liquor which is debauching the Africans, the opium\r\nwhich is enervating the Chinese, 6,000 tons a year coming from\r\nIndia at a profit of $32,000,000 to the English Government.[32]\r\n\r\n\r\n[32] The Rev. Dr. Henry van Dyke, Sermon.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can such a civilization prepare the way for Christianity?\r\nAs a matter of fact, the Chinese already have a civilization,\r\nand if our civilization is considered apart from its distinctively\r\nChristian elements, it is not so much superior to the Chinese\r\nas we are apt to imagine. The differences are chiefly matters\r\nof taste and education. The truth is that always and everywhere,--\r\n\r\n``civilization, so far from obliterating iniquity, imports into the world\r\niniquities of its own. It changes to some degree the aspects of iniquity, but\r\ndoes not make them less. Further than that its effect is rather regularly\r\nto dress iniquity in a less repulsive and more attractive form, and in that\r\nway makes it more difficult to get rid of than before. There is no sin so\r\ninsinuating as refined and elegant sin, and of that civilization is the expert\r\npatron and champion. The sin that is the devil's chief stock in trade\r\nis not what is going on in Hester Street, but on the polite avenues.\r\n. . . Evangelization conducts to civilization, but civilization has no\r\nnecessary bearing on evangelization; that is to say, there is in civilization\r\nno energy inherently calculated to yield gospel facts. By carrying schools\r\nand arts, trade and manufacture, among people that are now savages you\r\nmay be able to refine the quality of their deviltry, but that is not even\r\nthe first step towards making angels, or even saints of them.''[33]\r\n\r\n\r\n[33] The Rev. Dr. Charles H. Parkhurst, Sermon.\r\n\r\n\r\nLowell is said to have administered the following stinging\r\nrebuke to the skeptical critics who sneered about missionaries\r\nand declared the adequacy of civilization without them:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``When the microscopic search of skepticism, which has hunted the\r\nheavens and sounded the seas to disprove the existence of a Creator, has\r\nturned its attention to human society and has found a place on this planet\r\nten miles square where a decent man can live in decency, comfort and\r\nsecurity, supporting and educating his children unspoiled and unpolluted;\r\na place where age is reverenced, manhood respected, womanhood honoured,\r\nand human life held in due regard; when skeptics can find such\r\na place ten miles square on this globe where the gospel of Christ has\r\nnot gone and cleared the way, and laid the foundation and made decency\r\nand security possible, it will then be in order for the skeptical literati\r\nto move thither and there ventilate their views.''\r\n\r\n\r\nBut we may add Darwin's conjecture that ``should a voyager\r\nchance to be at the point of shipwreck on some unknown\r\ncoast, he will devoutly pray that the lesson of the missionary\r\nmay have extended thus far.'' Bishop Thoburn says that no\r\nnation without Christianity has ever advanced a step, and that\r\nwhile in Washington there are 6,000 models of plows invented\r\nby Americans, India is using the same plow as in the days of\r\nDavid and Solomon. But wherever Christ's gospel goes, true\r\ncivilization appears. ``A better soul will soon make better\r\ncircumstances; but better circumstances will not necessarily make\r\na better soul.''[34]\r\n\r\n\r\n[34] The Rev. Dr. James H. Snowden.\r\n\r\n ``We must be here to work,\r\n And men who work can only work for men,\r\n And not to work in vain must comprehend\r\n Humanity, and so work humanly,\r\n And raise men's bodies still by raising souls.''\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHE BUILDING OF RAILWAYS[35]\r\n\r\n\r\n[35] Part of this chapter appeared as an article in the American Monthly\r\nReview of Reviews, February, 1904.\r\n\r\nTHE extension of trade has naturally been accompanied\r\nnot only by the increase of foreign steamship\r\nlines to the numerous port cities of China, but by the\r\ndevelopment of almost innumerable coastwise and river vessels.\r\nMany of these are owned and operated by the Chinese themselves,\r\nbut as steamers came with the foreigners and as they\r\ndrive out the native junks and bring beggary to their owners,\r\nthe masses of the Chinese cannot be expected to feel kindly\r\ntowards such competition, however desirable the steamer may\r\nappear to be from the view-point of a more disinterested\r\nobserver. But this interference with native customs has been far\r\nless revolutionary than that of the railways.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of foreign commerce upon China has naturally\r\nresulted in demands for concessions to build railways, in order\r\nthat the country might be opened up for traffic and the products\r\nof the interior be more easily and quickly brought to the coast.\r\nThe first railroad in China was built by British promoters in\r\n1876. It ran from Shanghai to Woosung, only fourteen miles.\r\nGreat was the excitement of the populace, and no sooner was\r\nit completed than the Government bought it, tore up the road-\r\nbed, and dumped the engines into the river. That ended\r\nrailway-building till 1881, when, largely through the influence\r\nof Wu Ting-fang, late Chinese Minister to the United States,\r\nthe Chinese themselves, under the guidance of an English\r\nengineer, built a little line from the Kai-ping coal mines to\r\nTaku, at the mouth of the Pei-ho River and the ocean gate\r\nway to the capital. Seeing the benefit of this road, the Chinese\r\nraised further funds, borrowed more from the English, and\r\ngradually extended it 144 miles to Shan-hai Kwan on the\r\nnorth, while they ran another line to Tien-tsin, twenty-seven\r\nmiles from Tong-ku, and thence onward seventy-nine miles\r\ndirect to Peking. This system forms the Imperial Railway and\r\nbelongs to the Chinese Government, though bonds are held by\r\nthe English, who loaned money for construction, and though\r\nEnglish and American engineers built and superintended the\r\nsystem. The local staff, however, is Chinese.\r\n\r\nNo more concessions were granted to foreigners till 1895,\r\nbut then they were given so rapidly that, in 1899 when the\r\nBoxer Society first began to attract attention, there were, including\r\nthe Imperial Railway, not only 566 miles in operation,\r\nbut 6,000 miles were projected, and engineers were surveying\r\nrights of way through whole provinces. Much of the completed\r\nwork was undone during the destructive madness of the\r\nBoxer uprising, but reconstruction began as soon as the tumult\r\nwas quelled. According to the Archiv fur Eisenbahnwesen of\r\nGermany, the total length of the railways in use in 1903 in\r\nChina was 1,236 kilometers or about 742 miles.\r\n\r\nSeveral foreign nations have taken an aggressive part in this\r\nmovement. In the north, Russia, not satisfied with a terminus\r\nat cold Vladivostok where ice closes the harbour nearly half\r\nthe year, steadily demanded concessions which would enable\r\nher Trans-Siberian Railway to reach an ice-free winter port,\r\nand thus give her a commanding position in the Pacific and a\r\nchannel through which the trade of northern Asia might reach\r\nand enrich Russia's vast possessions in Siberia and Europe.\r\nSo Russian diplomacy rested not till it had secured the right to\r\nextend the Trans-Siberian Railway southward from Sungari\r\nthrough Manchuria to Tachi-chao near Mukden. From there\r\none branch runs southward to Port Arthur and Dalny and\r\nanother southwestward to Shan-hai Kwan, where the great\r\nWall of China touches the sea. As connection is made at that\r\npoint with the Imperial Railway to Taku, Tien-tsin and Peking,\r\nMoscow 5,746 miles away, is brought within seventeen days of\r\nPeking. Thus, Russian influence had an almost unrestricted\r\nentrance to China on the North, while a third branch from\r\nMukden to Wiju, on the Korean frontier, will connect with a\r\nprojected line running from that point southward to Seoul, the\r\ncapital of Korea. A St. Petersburg dispatch, dated November\r\n26, 1903, states that a survey has just been completed from\r\nKiakhta, Siberia, to Peking by way of Gugon, a distance of\r\nabout a thousand miles. This road, if built, will give the Russians\r\na short cut direct to the capital.\r\n\r\nIn the populous province of Shantung, a German railroad,\r\nopened April 8, 1901, runs from Tsing-tau on Kiao-chou Bay\r\ninto the heart of the populous Shantung Province via Weihsien.\r\nThe line already reaches the capital, Chinan-fu, while\r\nulterior plans include a line from Tsing-tau via Ichou-fu to\r\nChinan-fu, so that German lines will ere long completely encircle\r\nthis mighty Province. At Chinan-fu, this road will meet\r\nanother great trunk line, partly German and partly English,\r\nwhich is being pushed southward from Tien-tsin to Chin-kiang.\r\nAn English sydicate, known as the British-Chinese Corporation,\r\nis to control a route from Shanghai via Soochow and\r\nChin-kiang to Nanking and Soochow via Hangchow to Ningpo,\r\nwhile the Anglo-Chinese Railway Syndicate of London is said\r\nto be planning a railway from Canton to Cheng-tu-fu, the provincial\r\ncapital of Sze-chuen. Meanwhile, the original line from\r\nShanghai to Wu-sung has been reconstructed by the English.\r\n\r\nOne of the most valuable concessions in China has been obtained\r\nby the Anglo-Italian Syndicate in the Provinces of\r\nShan-si and Shen-si for it gives the right to construct railways\r\nand to operate coal mines in a region where some of the most\r\nextensive anthracite deposits in the world are located. A beginning\r\nhas already been made, and when the lines are completed,\r\nthe industrial revolution in China will be mightily advanced.\r\n\r\nAn alleged Belgian syndicate, to which was formed with then\r\nwholly disinterested assistance of the French and Russian legations,\r\nobtained in 1896 a concession to construct the Lu Han\r\nRailway from Peking 750 miles southward to Hankow, the\r\ncommercial metropolis on the middle Yang-tze River. It is significant,\r\nhowever, that while the Belgian syndicate was temporarily\r\nembarrassed, the Russo-Chinese Bank of Peking aided\r\nthe Chinese Director-General of Railways to begin the section\r\nrunning from Peking to Paoting-fu. The road is open to\r\nShunte-fu, 300 miles south of Peking and to Hsu-chou, 434\r\nkilometers north of Hankow. The Russo-Chinese Bank is\r\nbuilding a branch line from Ching-ting via Tai-yuen-fu to Singan-fu\r\nin Shen-si, where it will be well started on the beaten\r\ncaravan route between north China and Russian Central Asia.\r\nOn November 13, 1903, the Belgian International Eastern\r\nCompany signed a contract to construct a railway from Kai-\r\nfeng-fu, the capital of the Province of Honan, 110 miles west\r\nto Honan-fu.\r\n\r\nI found the line running south from Peking well-built with\r\nsolid road-bed, massive stone culverts, iron bridges, and heavy\r\nsteel rails. The first and second class coaches are not attractive\r\nin appearance, and though the fare for the former is double\r\nthat of the latter, the chief discernible difference is that in the\r\nfirst class compartment, which is usually in one end of a second-\r\nclass car, the seats are curved and the passengers fewer in\r\nnumber, while in the second-class the seats are straight boards\r\nand are apt to be crowded with Chinese coolies. Neither class\r\nis upholstered and neither would be considered comfortable in\r\nAmerica, but after the weeks I had spent in a mule-litter, anything\r\non rails seemed luxurious. Our train was a mixed one,--\r\nthe first-class compartments containing a few French officers,\r\nthe second-class filled with Chinese coolies and French soldiers,\r\nwhile a half-dozen flat cars were loaded with horses and mules.\r\nA large Roger's locomotive from Paterson, New Jersey, drew\r\nour long train smoothly and easily, though the schedule was so\r\nslow and the stops so long that we were seven hours and a half\r\nin making a run of a hundred miles.\r\n\r\nRailway-building in South China, outside of French territory,\r\nbegan with a line from Canton to Hankow which was projected\r\nin 1895 by Senator Calvin S. Brice, William Barclay\r\nParsons being the engineer. The usual governmental difficulties\r\nwere encountered, but in 1902 an imperial decree gave the\r\nconcession to the American-China Development Company.\r\nAmerican capital was to finance the road, though with some\r\nEuropean aid. The company had the power, under its concession,\r\nto issue fifty-year five per cent. gold bonds to the amount\r\nof $42,500,000, the interest being guaranteed by the Chinese\r\nGovernment. The main line will be 700 miles long, and\r\nbranches will increase the total mileage to 900. On November\r\n15, 1903, a section ten miles long from Canton to Fat-shan was\r\nformally opened for traffic in the presence of the Hon. Francis\r\nMay, colonial secretary and registrar-general of the Hongkong\r\nGovernment, a large number of Europeans and Americans, and\r\nimmense crowds of Chinese who manifested their excitement by\r\nan almost incessant rattle of fire-crackers. By October, 1904,\r\ntrains were running regularly to Sam-shui, about twenty-five\r\nmiles beyond Fat-shan. This is a branch line. The main\r\nline will run on the other side of the West River. In 1905,\r\nthe government decided to complete the line itself and cancelled\r\nthe concession, paying the company as indemnity $6,750,000.\r\nA line from Kowloon to Canton has been planned for some\r\ntime and it is likely to be hastened by the announcement in the\r\nSouth China Morning Post, May 12, 1904, that an American-\r\nChinese syndicate had obtained a concession, granted to the\r\nauthorities of Macao by China through a special Portuguese\r\nMinister, to construct a railway from Macao to Canton. The\r\nsyndicate hopes to secure American capital and the British\r\nmerchants of Hongkong are a little nervous as they think of the\r\npossibility of an independent outlet for the Canton-Hankow\r\nRailway at Macao.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that if these vast schemes can be realized\r\nthere will not only be numerous lines running from the\r\ncoast into the interior, but a great trunk line from Canton\r\nthrough the very heart of the Empire to Peking, where other\r\nroads can be taken not only to Manchuria and Korea but to\r\nany part of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn the farther south, the French are equally busy. By the\r\nFranco-Chinese Convention of June 20, 1895, a French\r\ncompany secured the right to construct a railroad from Lao-\r\nkai to Yun-nan-fu. The French had a road from Hai-fong in\r\nTong-king to Sang-chou at the Chinese frontier, and in 1896\r\nthey obtained from China a concession to extend it to Nanning-\r\nfu, on the West River. This privilege has since been enlarged\r\nso that the line will be continued to the treaty port of Pak-hoi\r\non the Gulf of Tong-king. The French fondly dream of the\r\ntime when they can extend their Yun-nan Railway northward\r\ntill it taps and makes tributary to French Indo-China the vast\r\nand fertile valley of the upper Yang-tze River. Meanwhile,\r\nthe English talk of a line from Kowloon, opposite Hongkong,\r\nto Canton, and of connecting their Burma Railroad, which\r\nalready runs from Rangoon to Kun-long ferry, with the\r\nYang-tze valley, so that the enormous trade of southern interior\r\nChina may not flow into a French port, as the French so\r\nardently desire, but into an English city.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to describe adequately the far-\r\nreaching effect upon China and the Chinese of this extension of\r\nmodern railways. We have had an illustration of its meaning\r\nin America, where the transcontinental railroads resulted in\r\nthe amazing development of our western plains and of the\r\nPacific Coast. The effect of such a development in China can\r\nhardly be overestimated, for China has more than ten times the\r\npopulation of the trans-Mississippi region while its territory is\r\nvaster and equally rich in natural resources. As I travelled\r\nthrough the land, it seemed to me that almost the whole\r\nnorthern part of the Empire was composed of illimitable fields\r\nof wheat and millet, and that in the south the millions of paddy\r\nplots formed a rice-field of continental proportions. Hidden\r\naway in China's mountains and underlying her boundless\r\nplateaus are immense deposits of coal and iron; while above\r\nany other country on the globe, China has the labour for the\r\ndevelopment of agriculture and manufacture. Think of the\r\ninfluence not only upon the Chinese but the whole world,\r\nwhen railroads not only carry the corn of Hunan to the famine\r\nsufferers in Shantung, but when they bring the coal, iron and\r\nother products of Chinese soil and industry within reach of\r\nsteamship lines running to Europe and America. To make\r\nall these resources available to the rest of the world, and in turn\r\nto introduce among the 426,000,000 of the Chinese the products\r\nand inventions of Europe and America, is to bring about\r\nan economic transformation of stupendous proportions.\r\n\r\nImagine, too, what changes are involved in the substitution\r\nof the locomotive for the coolie as a motive power, the\r\nfreight car for the wheelbarrow in the shipment of produce,\r\nand the passenger coach for the cart and the mule-litter in the\r\ntransportation of people. Railways will inevitably inaugurate\r\nin China a new era, and when a new era is inaugurated for\r\none-third of the human race the other two-thirds are certain to\r\nbe affected in many ways.\r\n\r\nThat the transformation is attended by outbreaks of violence\r\nis natural enough. Even such a people as the English and the\r\nScotch were at first inimical to railroads, and it is notorious\r\nthat the great Stephenson had to meet not only ridicule but\r\nstrenuous opposition. Everybody knows, too, that in the\r\nUnited States stage companies and stage drivers did all they\r\ncould to prevent the building of railroads, and that learned\r\ngentlemen made eloquent speeches which proved to the entire\r\nsatisfaction of their authors that railways would disarrange all\r\nthe conditions of society and business and bring untold evils\r\nin their train. If the alert and progressive Anglo-Saxon took\r\nthis initial position, is it surprising that it should be taken with\r\nfar greater intensity by Orientals who for uncounted centuries\r\nhave plodded along in perfect contentment, and who now find\r\nthat the whole order of living to which they and their fathers\r\nhave become adapted is being shaken to its foundation by the\r\niron horse of the foreigner? Millions of coolies earn a living\r\nby carrying merchandise in baskets or wheeling it in barrows\r\nat five cents a day. A single railroad train does the work of a\r\nthousand coolies, and thus deprives them of their means of\r\nsupport. Myriads of farmers grew the beans and peanuts out\r\nof which illuminating oil was made. But since American\r\nkerosene was introduced in 1864, its use has become well-nigh\r\nuniversal, and the families who depended upon the bean-oil and\r\npeanut-oil market are starving. Cotton clothing is generally\r\nworn in China, except by the better classes, and China\r\nformerly made her own cotton cloth. Now American manufacturers\r\ncan sell cotton in China cheaper than the Chinese can\r\nmake it themselves.\r\n\r\nAll this is, of course, inevitable. It is indeed for the best interests\r\nof the people of China themselves, but it enables us to\r\nunderstand why so many of the Chinese resent the introduction\r\nof foreign goods. That much of this business is passing into\r\nthe hands of the Chinese themselves does not help the matter,\r\nfor the people know that the goods are foreign, and that the\r\nforeigners are responsible for their introduction.\r\n\r\nNor are racial prejudices and vested interests the only foes\r\nwhich the railway has to encounter in China. As we have\r\nseen, the Chinese, while not very religious, are very superstitious.\r\nThey people the earth and air with spirits, who, in their\r\njudgment, have baleful power over man. Before these spirits\r\nthey tremble in terror, and no inconsiderable part of their\r\ntime and labour is devoted to outwitting them, for the Chinese\r\ndo not worship the spirits, except to propitiate and deceive\r\nthem. They believe that the spirits cannot turn a corner, but\r\nmust move in a straight line. Accordingly, in China you do\r\nnot often find one window opposite another window, lest the\r\nspirits may pass through. You will seldom find a straight\r\nroad from one village to another village, but only a distractingly\r\ncircuitous path, while the roads are not only crooked, but\r\nso atrociously bad that it is difficult for the foreign traveller to\r\nkeep his temper. The Chinese do not count their own inconvenience\r\nif they can only baffle their demoniac foes. It is the\r\ncustom of the Chinese to bury their dead wherever a geomancer\r\nindicates a ``lucky'' place. So particular are they about\r\nthis that the bodies of the wealthy are often kept for a considerable\r\nperiod while a suitable place of interment is being\r\nfound. In Canton there is a spacious enclosure where the\r\ncoffins sometimes lie for years, each in a room more or less\r\nelaborate according to the taste or ability of the family. The\r\nplace once chosen immediately becomes sacred. In a land\r\nwhich has been so densely populated for thousands of years,\r\ngraves are therefore not only innumerable but omnipresent.\r\nIn my travels in China, I was hardly ever out of sight of these\r\nconical mounds of the dead, and as a rule I could count hundreds\r\nof them from my shendza.\r\n\r\nEvery visitor to Canton and Chefoo will recall the hilly\r\nregions just outside of the old city walls that are literally covered\r\nwith graves, those of the richer classes being marked by\r\nsmall stone or brick amphitheatres. Yet these are cemeteries\r\nnot because they have been set apart for that purpose, but because\r\ngraves have gradually filled all available spaces.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese reverence their dead and venerate the spots in\r\nwhich they lie. From a Chinese view-point it is an awful thing\r\nto desecrate them. Not only property and those sacred feelings\r\nwith which all peoples regard their dead are involved but\r\nalso the vital religious question of ancestral worship. Accordingly\r\nChinese law protects all graves by heavy sanctions, imposing\r\nthe death penalty by strangling on the malefactor who\r\nopens a grave without the permission of the owner, and by decapitation\r\nif in doing so the coffin is opened or broken so as\r\nto expose the body to view. Imagine then their feelings\r\nwhen they see haughty foreigners run a railroad straight as an\r\narrow from city to city, opening a highway over which the\r\ndreaded spirits may run, and ruthlessly tearing through the\r\ntombs hallowed by the most sacred associations.\r\n\r\nNo degree of care can avoid the irritations caused by railway\r\nconstruction. In building the line from Tsing-tau to Kiao-chou,\r\na distance of forty-six miles, the Germans, as far as practicable,\r\nran around the places most thickly covered with graves.\r\nBut in spite of this, no less than 3,000 graves had to be removed.\r\nIt was impossible to settle with the individual owners,\r\nas it was difficult in many cases to ascertain who they were,\r\nmost of the graves being unmarked, and some of the families\r\nconcerned having died out or moved away. Moreover, the\r\nOriental has no idea of time, and dearly loves to haggle,\r\nespecially with a foreigner whom he feels no compunction in\r\nswindling. So the railway company made its negotiations\r\nwith the local magistrates, showing them the routes, indicating\r\nthe graves that were in the way, and paying them an\r\naverage of $3 (Mexican) for removing each grave, they to\r\nfind and settle with the owners. This was believed to be fair,\r\nfor $3 is a large sum where the coin in common circulation\r\nis the copper ``cash,'' so small in value that 1,600 of them\r\nequal a gold dollar, and where a few dozen cash will buy a\r\nday's food for an adult. But while some of the Chinese were\r\nglad to accept this arrangement, others were not. They wanted\r\nmore, or they had special affection for the dead, or that particular\r\nspot had been carefully selected because it was favoured\r\nby the spirits. Besides, the magistrates doubtless kept a part\r\nof the price as their share. Chinese officials are underpaid,\r\nare expected to ``squeeze'' commissions, and no funds can\r\npass through their hands without a percentage of loss. Then,\r\nas the Asiatic is very deliberate, the company was obliged to\r\nspecify a date by which all designated graves must be removed.\r\nAs many of the bodies were not taken up within that time,\r\nthe company had to remove them.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances, we should not be surprised that\r\nsome of the most furiously anti-foreign feeling in China was in\r\nthe villages along the line of that railroad. Why should the\r\nhated foreigner force his line through their country when the\r\npeople did not want it? Of course, it would save time, but,\r\nas an official naively said, ``We are not in a hurry.'' So the\r\nvillagers watched the construction with ill-concealed anger,\r\nand to-day that railroad, as well as most other railroads in\r\nNorth China, can only be kept open by detachments of foreign\r\nsoldiers at all the important stations. I saw them at almost\r\nevery stop,--German soldiers from Tsing-tau to Kiao-chou,\r\nBritish from Tong-ku to Peking, French from Peking to Paoting-fu,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, railways in China are usually profitable. It is\r\ntrue that the opposition to the building of a railroad is apt to\r\nbe bitter, that mobs are occasionally destructive, and that locomotives\r\nand other rolling stock rapidly deteriorate under native\r\nhandling unless closely watched by foreign superintendents.\r\nBut, on the other hand, the Government is usually forced to\r\npay indemnities for losses resulting from violence. The road,\r\ntoo, once built, is in time appreciated by the thrifty Chinese,\r\nwho swallow their prejudices and patronize it in such enormous\r\nnumbers, and ship by it such quantities of their produce, that\r\nthe business speedily becomes remunerative, while the population\r\nand the resources of the country are so great as to afford\r\nalmost unlimited opportunity for the development of traffic.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, on all the roads, the first-class compartments,\r\nwhen there are any, have comparatively few passengers, chiefly\r\nofficials and foreigners. The second-class cars are well filled\r\nwith respectable-looking people, who are apparently small merchants,\r\nstudents, minor officials, etc. The third-class cars,\r\nwhich are usually more numerous, are packed with chattering\r\npeasants. The first-class fares are about the same as ordinary\r\nrates in the United States. The second-class are about half\r\nthe first-class rates, and the third-class are often less than the\r\nequivalent of a cent a mile. This is a wise adjustment in a\r\nland where the average man is so thrifty and so poor that he\r\nwould not and could not pay a price which would be deemed\r\nmoderate in America, and where his scale of living makes him\r\ncontent with the rudest accommodations. Very little baggage\r\nis carried free, twenty pounds only on the German lines, so\r\nthat excess baggage charges amount to more than in America.\r\n\r\nThe freight cars, during my visit, were, for the most part,\r\nloaded with the materials and supplies necessitated by the work\r\nof railway-construction and by the extensive rebuilding of the\r\nnative and foreign property which had been destroyed by the\r\nBoxers. But in normal conditions the railways carry inland a\r\nlarge number of foreign manufactured articles, and in turn\r\nbring to the ports the wheat, rice, peanuts, ore, coal, pelts,\r\nsilk, wool, cotton, matting, paper, straw-braid, earthenware,\r\nsugar, tea, tobacco, fireworks, fruit, vegetables, and other\r\nproducts of the interior. Short hauls are the rule, thus far,\r\nboth for passengers and freight. This is partly because the\r\nlong-distance lines within the Empire are not yet completed,\r\nand partly because the typical Chinese of the lower classes in\r\nthe interior provinces has never been a score of miles away from\r\nhis native village in his life, and has been so accustomed to\r\nregard a wheelbarrow trip of a dozen miles as a long journey\r\nthat he is a little cautious, at first, in lengthening his radius of\r\nmovement. But he soon learns, especially as the struggle for\r\nexistence in an overcrowded country begets a desire to take advantage\r\nof an opportunity to better his condition elsewhere.\r\nOnce fairly started, he is apt to go far, as the numbers of\r\nChinese in Siam, the Philippines, and America clearly show.\r\nThe literary and official classes are less apt to go abroad, but\r\nthey are more accustomed to moving about within the limits\r\nof the Empire, as they must go to the central cities for their\r\nexaminations, and as offices are held for such short terms that\r\nmagistrates are frequently shifted from province to province.\r\nWhen this vast population of naturally industrious and commer-\r\ncial people becomes accustomed to railways and gets to moving\r\nfreely upon them, stupendous things are likely to happen,\r\nboth for China and for the world.\r\n\r\nAnd so the foreign syndicates relentlessly continue the work\r\nof railway-construction. Trade cannot be checked. It advances\r\nby an inherent energy which it is futile to ignore. And\r\nit ought to advance for the result will inevitably be to the advantage\r\nof China. A locomotive brings intellectual and physical\r\nbenefits, the appliances which mitigate the poverty and\r\nbarrenness of existence and increase the ability to provide for\r\nthe necessities and the comforts of life. In one of our great\r\nlocomotive works in America I once saw twelve engines in construction\r\nfor China, and my imagination kindled as I thought\r\nwhat a locomotive means amid that stagnant swarm of humanity,\r\nhow impossible it is that any village through which it has\r\nonce run should continue to be what it was before, how its\r\nwhistle puts to flight a whole brood of hoary superstitions and\r\nsummons a long-slumbering people to new life. We need regret\r\nonly that these benefits are so often accompanied by the\r\nevils which disgrace our civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nThe Political Force and the National\r\nProtest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nTHE AGGRESSIONS OF EUROPEAN POWERS\r\n\r\nTHE political force was set in motion partly by the\r\nambitions of European powers to extend their\r\ninfluence in Asia, and partly by the necessity for protecting\r\nthe commercial interests referred to in the preceding\r\nchapters. The conservatism and exclusiveness of the Chinese,\r\nthe disturbance of economic conditions caused by the introduction\r\nof foreign goods, and the greed and brutality of foreign\r\ntraders combined to arouse a fierce opposition to the lodgment\r\nof the foreigner. The early trading ships were usually armed,\r\nand exasperated by the haughtiness and duplicity of the Chinese\r\nofficials and their greedy disposition to mulct the white\r\ntrader, they did not hesitate to use force in effecting their purpose.\r\n\r\nBut the nations of Europe, becoming more and more convinced\r\nof the magnitude of the Chinese market, pressed resolutely\r\non; and with the hope of creating a better understanding\r\nand of opening the ports to trade, they sent envoys to\r\nChina. The arrival of these envoys precipitated a new controversy,\r\nfor the Chinese Government from time immemorial\r\nconsidered itself the supreme government of the world, and,\r\nnot being accustomed to receive the agents of other nations except\r\nas inferiors, was not disposed to accord the white man\r\nany different treatment. The result was a series of collisions\r\nfollowed by territorial aggressions that were numerous enough\r\nto infuriate a more peaceably disposed people than the\r\nChinese.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese were the first to come, a ship of those ven-\r\nturesome traders appearing near Canton in 1516. Its reception\r\nwas kindly, but when the next year brought eight armed\r\nvessels and an envoy, the friendliness of the Chinese changed\r\nto suspicion which ripened into hostility when the Portuguese\r\nbecame overbearing and threatening. Violence met with\r\nviolence. It is said that armed parties of Portuguese went into\r\nvillages and carried off Chinese women. Feuds multiplied and\r\nbecame more bloody. At Ningpo, the Chinese made awful reprisal\r\nby destroying thirty-five Portuguese ships and killing 800\r\nof their crews. The execution of one or more of the members\r\nof a delegation to Peking brought matters to a crisis, and in\r\n1534, the Portuguese transferred their factories to Macao,\r\nwhich they have ever since held, though it was not till 1887\r\nthat their position there was officially recognized. Portuguese\r\npower has waned and Macao to-day is an unimportant place\r\npolitically, but it is significant that this early foreign settlement\r\nin China has been and still is such a moral plague spot that\r\nthe Chinese may be pardoned if their first impressions of the\r\nwhite man were unfavourable.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards were the next Europeans with whom the\r\nChinese came into contact. In this case, however, the contact\r\nwas due not so much to the coming of the Spaniards to China\r\nas to their occupation in 1543 of the Philippine Islands, with\r\nwhich the Chinese had long traded and where they had already\r\nsettled in considerable numbers. Mutual jealousies resulted\r\nand Castilian arrogance and brutality ere long engendered such\r\nbitterness that massacre after massacre of the Chinese occurred,\r\nthat of 1603 almost exterminating the Chinese population of\r\nManila.\r\n\r\nThe growing demand for coffee, which Europeans had first\r\nreceived in 1580 from Arabia, brought Dutch ships into Asiatic\r\nwaters in 1598. After hostile experiences with the Portuguese\r\nat Macao, they seized the Pescadores Islands in 1622. But the\r\nopposition of the Chinese led the Dutch to withdraw to Formosa,\r\nwhere their stormy relations with natives, Chinese from\r\nthe mainland and Japanese finally resulted in their expulsion in\r\n1662. Since then the Dutch have contented themselves with a\r\nfew trading factories chiefly at Canton and with their possessions\r\nin Malaysia, so that they have been less aggressive in China\r\nthan several other European nations.\r\n\r\nA more formidable power appeared on the scene in 1635,\r\nwhen four ships[36] of the English East India Company sailed up\r\nthe Pearl River. The temper of the newcomers was quickly\r\nshown when the Chinese, incited by the jealous Portuguese,\r\nsought to prevent their lodgment, for the English, so the record\r\nquaintly runs, ``did on a sudden display their bloody ensigns,\r\nand . . . each ship began to play furiously upon the forts\r\nwith their broadsides . . . put on board all their ordnance,\r\nfired the council-house, and demolished all they could.''\r\nThen they sailed on to Canton, and when their peremptory demand\r\nfor trading privileges was met with evasion and excuses,\r\nthey ``pillaged and burned many vessels and villages . . .\r\nspreading destruction with fire and sword.'' Describing this\r\nincident, Sir George Staunton, Secretary of the first British\r\nembassy to China, naively remarked--``The unfortunate circumstances\r\nunder which the English first got footing in China\r\nmust have operated to their disadvantage and rendered their\r\nsituation for some time peculiarly unpleasant.''[37] But as early\r\nas 1684, they had established themselves in Canton.\r\n\r\n\r\n[36] Parker, ``China,'' p. 9, places the number of ships at five and the date\r\nas 1637.\r\n\r\n[37] Foster, ``American Diplomacy in the Orient,'' p. 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 15, 1834, a British Commission headed by Lord Napier\r\narrived at Macao, and the 25th of the same month proceeded\r\nto Canton empowered by an act of Parliament to negotiate\r\nwith the Chinese regarding trade ``to and from the dominions\r\nof the Emperor of China, and for the purpose of protecting and\r\npromoting such trade.''[38] The government of Canton, however,\r\nrefused to receive Lord Napier's letter for the character-\r\nistic reason that it did not purport to be a petition from an inferior\r\nto a superior. In explaining the matter to the Hong\r\nmerchants with a view to their bringing the explanation to the\r\nattention of Lord Napier, the haughty Governor reminded them\r\nthat foreigners were allowed in China only as trading agents,\r\nand that no functionary of any political rank could be allowed\r\nto enter the Empire unless special permission were given by the\r\nImperial Government in response to a respectful petition. He\r\nadded:--\r\n\r\n\r\n[38] Foster, p. 57.\r\n\r\n\r\n``To sum up the whole matter, the nation has its laws. Even\r\nEngland has its laws. How much more the Celestial Empire! How\r\nflaming bright are its great laws and ordinances. More terrible than\r\nthe awful thunderbolts! Under this whole bright heaven, none dares\r\nto disobey them. Under its shelter are the four seas. Subject to its\r\nsoothing care are ten thousand kingdoms. The said barbarian eye (Lord\r\nNapier), having come over a sea of several myriads of miles in extent to\r\nexamine and have superintendence of affairs, must be a man thoroughly\r\nacquainted with the principles of high dignity.''[39]\r\n\r\n\r\n[39] Foster, p. 59.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, the equally haughty British representative\r\nindignantly protested; but without avail. He was asked\r\nto return to Macao, and was informed that the Governor could\r\nnot have any further communication with him except through\r\nthe Hong merchants, and in the form of a respectful petition.\r\nThe Governor indignantly declared:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``There has never been such a thing as outside barbarians sending a\r\nletter. . . . It is contrary to everything of dignity and decorum. The\r\nthing is most decidedly impossible. . . . The barbarians of this nation\r\n(Great Britain) coming to or leaving Canton have beyond their trade\r\nnot any public business; and the commissioned officers of the Celestial\r\nEmpire never take cognizance of the trivial affairs of trade. . . . The\r\nsome hundreds of thousands of commercial duties yearly coming from the\r\nsaid nation concern not the Celestial Empire to the extent of a hair or a\r\nfeather's down. The possession or absence of them is utterly unworthy\r\nof one careful thought.''[40]\r\n\r\n\r\n[40] Ibid, p. 60.\r\n\r\nWhereupon the proud Briton published and distributed a review\r\nof the case, as he saw it, which closed as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``Governor Loo has the assurance to state in the edict of the 2d instant\r\nthat `the King (my master) has hitherto been reverently obedient.' I\r\nmust now request you to declare to them (the Hong merchants) that His\r\nMajesty, the King of England, is a great and powerful monarch, that he\r\nrules over an extent of territory in the four quarters of the world more\r\ncomprehensive in space and infinitely more so in power than the whole\r\nempire of China; that he commands armies of bold and fierce soldiers,\r\nwho have conquered wherever they went; and that he is possessed of\r\ngreat ships, where no native of China has ever yet dared to show his face.\r\nLet the Governor then judge if such a monarch will be `reverently obedient'\r\nto any one.''[41]\r\n\r\n\r\n[41] Foster, pp. 61, 62.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result of the increasing irritation was a decree by the\r\nGovernor of Canton peremptorily forbidding all further trade\r\nwith the English, and in retaliation the landing of a British\r\nforce, the sailing of British war-ships up the river and a battle\r\nat the Bogue Forts which guarded the entrance of Canton. A\r\ntruce was finally arranged and Lord Napier's commission left\r\nfor Macao, August 21st, where he died September 11th of an\r\nillness which his physician declared was directly due to the\r\nnervous strain and the many humiliations which he had suffered\r\nin his intercourse with the Chinese authorities. The\r\nGovernor meantime complacently reported to Peking that he had\r\ndriven off the barbarians!\r\n\r\nThe strain was intensified by the determination of the\r\nBritish to bring opium into China. The Chinese authorities\r\nprotested and in 1839 the Chinese destroyed 22,299 chests\r\nof opium valued at $9,000,000, from motives about as\r\nlaudable as those which led our revolutionary sires to empty\r\nEnglish tea into Boston Harbor. England responded by\r\nmaking war, the result of which was to force the drug upon an\r\nunwilling people, so that the vice which is to-day doing more\r\nto ruin the Chinese than all other vices combined is directly\r\ntraceable to the conduct of a Christian nation, though the\r\nEngland of to-day is presumably ashamed of this crime of the\r\nEngland of two generations ago.\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be inaccurate to represent Chinese objection\r\nto British opium as the sole cause of the ``Opium War''\r\nof 1840, for the indignities to which foreign traders and foreign\r\ndiplomats were continually subjected in their efforts to establish\r\ncommercial and political relations with the Chinese were rapidly\r\ndrifting the two nations into war. Still, it was peculiarly\r\nunfortunate and it put foreigners grievously in the wrong before\r\nthe Chinese that the overt act which developed the long-\r\ngathering bitterness into open rupture was the righteous if irregular\r\nseizure by the Chinese of a poison that the English\r\nfrom motives of unscrupulous greed were determined to force\r\nupon an unwilling people. The probability that war would\r\nhave broken out in time even if there had been no dispute\r\nabout opium does not mitigate the fact that from the beginning,\r\nforeign intercourse with China was so identified with an iniquitous\r\ntraffic that the Chinese had ample cause to distrust and\r\ndislike the white man.\r\n\r\nThis hostility was intensified when the war resulted in the\r\ndefeat of the Chinese and the treaty of Nanking in 1842 with\r\nits repudiation of all their demands, the compulsory cession of\r\nthe island of Hongkong, the opening of not only Canton but\r\nAmoy, Foochow, Shanghai, and Ningpo as treaty ports, the\r\nlocation of a British Consul in each port, and, most necessary\r\nbut most humiliating of all, the recognition of the extra-territorial\r\nrights of all foreigners so that no matter what their crime,\r\nthey could not be tried by Chinese courts but only by their\r\nown consuls. This treaty contributed so much to the opening\r\nof China that Dr. S. Wells Williams characterized it as ``one\r\nof the turning points in the history of mankind, involving the\r\nwelfare of all nations in its wide-reaching consequences.'' It\r\nwas therefore a lasting benefit to China and to the world. But\r\nthe Chinese did not then and do not yet appreciate the benefit,\r\nespecially as they saw clearly enough that the motive of the\r\nconqueror was his own aggrandizement.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, too, the next war between England and China,\r\nthough fundamentally due to the same conditions as the\r\n``Opium War,'' was again precipitated by a quarrel over\r\nopium, the lorcha Arrow loaded with the obnoxious drug and\r\nflying the British flag being seized by the Chinese. Once\r\nmore they suffered sore defeat and humiliating terms of peace\r\nin the treaty of 1858. The effort of the Peking Government to\r\nclose the Pei-ho River against an armed force caused a third\r\nwar in 1860 in which the British and French captured Peking,\r\nand by their excesses and cruelties still further added to the\r\nalready long list of reasons why the Chinese should hate their\r\nEuropean foes.\r\n\r\nNor did foreign aggression stop with this war. In 1861,\r\nEngland, in order to protect her interests at Hongkong, wrested\r\nfrom China the adjacent peninsula of Kowloon. In 1886, she\r\ntook Upper Burma, which China regarded as one of her dependencies.\r\nIn 1898, finding that Hongkong was still within\r\nthe range of modern cannon in Chinese waters seven miles\r\naway, England calmly took 400 square miles of additional territory,\r\nincluding Mirs and Deep Bays.\r\n\r\nThe visitor does not wonder that the British coveted Hongkong,\r\nfor it is one of the best harbours in the world. Certainly\r\nno other is more impressive. Noble hills, almost mountains,\r\nfor many are over 1,000 feet and the highest is 3,200, rise on\r\nevery side. Crafts of all kinds, from sampans and slipper-\r\nboats to ocean liners and war-ships, crowd the waters, for this\r\nis the third greatest port in the world, being exceeded in the\r\namount of its tonnage only by Liverpool and New York. The\r\ncity is very attractive from the water as it lies at the foot and\r\non the slopes of the famous Peak. The Chinese are said to\r\nnumber, as in Shanghai, over 300,000, while the foreign population\r\nis only 5,000. But to the superficial observer the proportions\r\nappear reversed as the foreign buildings are so spa-\r\ncious and handsome that they almost fill the foreground. The\r\nbusiness section of the city is hot and steaming, but an inclined\r\ntramway makes the Peak accessible and many of the\r\nBritish merchants have built handsome villas on that cooler,\r\nbreezier summit, 1,800 feet above the sea. The view is superb,\r\na majestic panorama of mountains, harbour, shipping, islands,\r\nocean and city. By its possession and fortification of this\r\nisland of Hongkong, England to-day so completely controls\r\nthe gateway to South China that the Chinese cannot get access\r\nto Canton, the largest city in the Empire, without running the\r\ngauntlet of British guns and mines which could easily sink any\r\nships that the Peking Government could send against it, and\r\nthe whole of the vast and populous basin of the Pearl or West\r\nRiver is at the mercy of the British whenever they care to take\r\nit. When we add to these invaluable holdings, the rights that\r\nEngland has acquired in the Yang-tze Valley and at Wei-hai\r\nWei in Shantung, we do not wonder that Mr. E. H. Parker,\r\nformerly British Consul at Kiung-Chou, rather naively remarks:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``In view of all this, no one will say, however much in matters of detail\r\nwe may have erred in judgment, that Great Britain has failed to secure\r\nfor herself, on the whole, a considerable number of miscellaneous commercial\r\nand political advantages from the facheuse situation arising out\r\nof an attitude on the part of the Chinese so hostile to progress.''[42]\r\n\r\n\r\n[42] ``China,'' pp. 95, 96.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrance, as far back as 1787, obtained the Peninsula of\r\nTourane and the Island of Pulu Condore by ``treaty'' with\r\nthe King of Cochin-China. The French soon began to regard\r\nAnnam as within their sphere of influence. In 1858, they\r\nseized Saigon and from it as a base extended French power\r\nthroughout Cochin-China and Cambodia, the treaty of 1862\r\ngiving an enforced legal sanction to these extensive claims.\r\nNot content with this, France steadily pushed her conquests\r\nnorthward, compelling one concession after another until in\r\n1882, she coolly decided to annex Tong-king. The Chinese\r\nobjected, but the war ended in a treaty, signed June 9, 1885,\r\nwhich gave France the coveted region. These vast regions,\r\nwhich China had for centuries regarded as tributary provinces,\r\nare now virtually French territory and are openly governed as\r\nsuch.\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of Russia's designs upon China are lost in\r\nthe haze of mediaeval antiquity. Russian imperial guards are\r\nfrequently mentioned at the Mongol Court of Peking in the\r\nthirteenth century.[43] In 1652, the Russians definitely began\r\ntheir struggle with the Manchus for the Valley of the Amur, a\r\nstruggle which in spite of temporary defeats and innumerable\r\ndisputes Russia steadily and relentlessly continued until she\r\nobtained the Lower Amur in 1855, the Ussuri district in 1860\r\nand finally, by the Cassini Convention of September, 1896,\r\nthe right to extend the Siberian Railway from Nerchinsk\r\nthrough Manchuria. How Russia pressed her aggressions in\r\nthis region we shall have occasion to note in a later chapter.\r\n\r\n[43] Parker, ``China,'' p. 96.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES AND CHINA\r\n\r\nTHE relations of the United States with China have,\r\nas a rule, been more sympathetic than those of\r\nEuropean nations. Americans have not sought territorial\r\nadvantage in China and on more than one occasion, our\r\nGovernment has exerted its influence in favour of peace and\r\njustice for the sorely beset Celestials.\r\n\r\nThe flag of the United States first appeared in Chinese\r\nwaters on a trading ship in 1785. From the beginning, Americans\r\nhad less trouble with the Chinese than Europeans had\r\nexperienced, partly because they had recently been at war with\r\nthe English whom the Chinese hated and feared, and partly\r\nbecause they were less violently aggressive in dealing with the\r\nChinese. By the treaties of July and October, 1844, the\r\nUnited States peacefully reaped the advantages which England\r\nhad obtained at the cost of war. November 17, 1856, two\r\nAmerican ships were fired upon by the Bogue Forts, but in\r\nspite of the hostilities which resulted, the representatives of the\r\nUnited States appeared to find more favour with the Chinese\r\nthan those of any other power in the negotiations at Tien-tsin\r\nin 1858, and their treaty was signed a week before those of the\r\nFrench and the British. Article X provided that the ``United\r\nStates shall have the right to appoint consuls and other commercial\r\nagents, to reside at such places in the dominions of\r\nChina as shall be agreed to be opened''; and Article XXX\r\nthat,\r\n\r\n``should at any time the Ta-Tsing Empire grant to any nation or the\r\nmerchants or citizens of any nation any right, privileges or favour connected\r\nwith either navigation, commerce, political or other intercourse which is\r\nnot conferred by this treaty, such right, privilege and favour shall at once\r\nfreely inure to the benefit of the United States, its public officers,\r\nmerchants and citizens.''\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the settlement of damages, the Chinese agreed to pay to\r\nthe United States half a million taels, then worth $735,288.\r\nWhen the adjustments with individual claimants left a balance\r\nof $453,400 in the treasury, Congress, to the unbounded and\r\ngrateful surprise of the Chinese, gave it back to them. Mr. Burlingame,\r\nthe celebrated United States Minister to China, became\r\nthe most popular foreign minister in Peking within a\r\nshort time after his arrival in 1862, and so highly did the\r\nChinese Government appreciate his efforts in its behalf that\r\nduring the American Civil War it promptly complied with his\r\nrequest to issue an edict forbidding all Confederate ships of\r\nwar from entering Chinese ports. Mr. Foster declares that\r\n``such an order enforced by the governments of Europe would\r\nhave saved the American commercial marine from destruction\r\nand shortened the Civil War.''[44]\r\n\r\n\r\n[44] Foster, ``American Diplomacy in the Orient,'' p. 259.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Washington in 1868 gave great satisfaction to\r\nthe Chinese Government as it contained pacific and, appreciative\r\nreferences to China, an express disclaimer of any designs\r\nupon the Empire and a willingness to admit Chinese to the\r\nUnited States. The treaty of 1880, however, considerably\r\nmodified this willingness and the treaty of 1894 rather sharply\r\nrestricted further immigration. But in the commercial treaty\r\nof 1880, the United States, at the request of the Chinese Government,\r\nagreed to a clause peremptorily forbidding any citizen\r\nof the United States from engaging in the opium traffic with\r\nthe Chinese or in any Chinese port.\r\n\r\nOur national policy was admirably expressed in the note sent\r\nby the Hon. Frederick F. Low, United States Minister at\r\nPeking, to the Tsung-li Yamen, March 20, 1871:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``To assure peace in the future, the people must be better informed of\r\nthe purposes of foreigners. They must be taught that merchants are\r\nengaged in trade which cannot but be beneficial to both native and\r\nforeigner, and that missionaries seek only the welfare of the people, and\r\nare engaged in no political plots or intrigues against the Government.\r\nWhenever cases occur in which the missionaries overstep the bounds of\r\ndecorum, or interfere in matters with which they have no proper concern,\r\nlet each case be reported promptly to the Minister of the country to which\r\nit belongs. Such isolated instances should not produce prejudice or engender\r\nhatred against those who observe their obligations, nor should\r\nsweeping complaints be made against all on this account. Those from\r\nthe United States sincerely desire the reformation of those whom they\r\nteach, and to do this they urge the examination of the Holy Scriptures,\r\nwherein the great doctrines of the present and a future state, and also the\r\nresurrection of the soul, are set forth, with the obligation of repentance,\r\nbelief in the Saviour, and the duties of man to himself and others. It is\r\nowing, in a great degree, to the prevalence of a belief in the truth of\r\nthe Scnptures that Western nations have attained their power and prosperity.\r\nTo enlighten the people is a duty which the officials owe to the\r\npeople, to foreigners, and themselves; for if, in consequence of ignorance,\r\nthe people grow discontented, and insurrection and riots occur, and the\r\nlives and property of foreigners are destroyed or imperilled, the Government\r\ncannot escape its responsibility for these unlawful acts.''\r\n\r\n\r\nReferring to this note, the Hon. J. C. B. Davis, acting\r\nSecretary of State, wrote to Mr. Low, October 19, 1871:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``The President regards it (your note to the Tsung-li Yamen) as wise\r\nand judicious. . . . Your prompt and able answer to these propositions\r\nleaves little to be said by the Department. . . . We stand upon\r\nour treaty rights; we ask no more, we expect no less. If other nations\r\ndemand more, if they advance pretensions inconsistent with the dignity\r\nof China as an independent Power, we are no parties to such acts. Our\r\ninfluence, so far as it may be legitimately and peacefully exerted, will be\r\nused to prevent such demands or pretensions, should there be serious reason\r\nto apprehend that they will be put forth. We feel that the Government\r\nof the Emperor is actuated by friendly feelings towards the United\r\nStates.''\r\n\r\n\r\nBut while the Government of the United States has been\r\nthus considerate and just in its dealings with the Chinese in\r\nChina, it has, singularly enough, been most inconsiderate and\r\nunjust in its treatment of Chinese in its own territory, and its\r\npolicy in this respect has done not a little to exasperate the\r\nChinese. The Chinese began to come to America in 1848,\r\nwhen two men and one woman arrived in San Francisco on\r\nthe brig Eagle. The discovery of gold soon brought multitudes,\r\nthe year 1852 alone seeing 2,026 arrivals. There are\r\nnow about 45,000 Chinese in California and 14,000 in Oregon\r\nand Washington. New York has about 6,300 Chinese, Philadelphia\r\n1,150, Boston 1,250, and many other cities have little\r\ngroups, while individual Chinese are scattered all over the\r\ncountry, though the total for the United States, excluding\r\nAlaska and Hawaii, is only 89,863.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the people of the Pacific coast towards the\r\nthe Chinese is an interesting study. At first, they welcomed\r\ntheir Oriental visitors. In January, 1853, the Hon. H. H.\r\nHaight, afterwards Governor of California, offered at a representative\r\nmeeting of San Francisco citizens this resolution--\r\n``Resolved that we regard with pleasure the presence of greater\r\nnumbers of these people (Chinese) among us as affording the\r\nbest opportunity of doing them good and through them of\r\nexerting our influence in their native land.'' And this resolution\r\nwas unanimously adopted. Moreover in a new country,\r\nwhere there was much manual labour to be done in developing\r\nresources and constructing railways, and where there were\r\ncomparatively few white labourers, the Chinese speedily proved\r\nto be a valuable factor. They were frugal, patient, willing,\r\nindustrious and cheap, and so the corporations in particular\r\nencouraged them to come.\r\n\r\nBut as the number of immigrants increased, first dislike,\r\nthen irritation and finally alarm developed, particularly among\r\nthe working classes who found their means of livelihood\r\nthreatened by the competition of cheaper labour. The newspapers\r\nbegan to give sensational accounts of the ``yellow\r\ndeluge'' that might ``swamp our institutions'' and to enlarge\r\nupon the danger that white labourers would not come to California\r\non account of the presence of Chinese. The ``sand\r\nlot orator'' appeared with his frenized harangues and the\r\npolitical demagogue sought favour with the multitudes by\r\npandering to their passions. Race prejudice, moreover, must\r\nalways be taken into account, especially when two races\r\nattempt to live together. The terms Jew and Gentile, Greek\r\nand barbarian, Roman and enemy are suggestive of the distrust\r\nwith which one race usually regards another. Christianity\r\nhas done much to moderate it, but it still exists, and let the\r\nresident of the North and East who remembers the recent race\r\nriots in Illinois and Ohio and New York think charitably of\r\nhis brethren who are confronted by the Chinese problem in\r\nCalifornia. So May 6, 1882, Congress passed the Restriction\r\nAct, which, as amended July 5, 1884, and reenacted in\r\n1903, is now in force.\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of high-minded Christian people who\r\nare unselfishly and lovingly toiling for the temporal and\r\nspiritual welfare of this Asiatic population in America. They\r\nrightly feel that the people of the United States have a special\r\nduty towards these Orientals, that the purifying power of\r\nChristianity can remove the dangers incident to their presence\r\nin our communities, and that if we treat them aright they will,\r\non their return to China, mightily influence their countrymen.\r\nBut the kindly efforts of these Christian people are unfortunately\r\ninsufficient to offset the general policy of the American people\r\nas a whole, especially as that policy is embodied in a stern law\r\nthat is most harshly enforced.\r\n\r\nAmericans are apt to think of themselves as China's best\r\nfriends and the facts stated show that there is some ground\r\nfor the claim. But before we exalt ourselves overmuch, we\r\nmight profitably read the correspondence between the Chinese\r\nMinisters at Washington and our Secretaries of State regarding\r\nthe outrages upon Chinese in the United States. Many\r\nChinese have suffered from mob violence in San Francisco and\r\nTacoma and other Pacific Coast cities almost as sorely as\r\nAmericans have suffered in China. Some years ago, they\r\nwere wantonly butchered in Rock Springs, Wyoming, and it\r\nwas as difficult for the Chinese to get indemnity out of our\r\nGovernment as it was for the Powers to get indemnity out of\r\nChina for the Boxer outrages.\r\n\r\nPresident Cleveland, in a message to Congress in 1885, felt\r\nobliged to make an allusion to this that was doubtless as humiliating\r\nto him as it was to decent Americans everywhere. The\r\nChinese Minister to the United States, in his presentation of\r\nthe case to Secretary of State Bayard, ``massed the evidence\r\ngoing to show that the massacre of the subjects of a friendly\r\nPower, residing in this country, was as unprovoked as it was\r\nbrutal; that the Governor and Prosecuting Attorney of the Territory\r\nopenly declared that no man could be punished for the\r\ncrime, though the murderers attempted no concealment; and\r\nthat all the pretended judicial proceedings were a burlesque.''\r\nAll this Mr. Bayard was forced to admit. Indeed he did not\r\nhesitate to characterize the proceedings as ``the wretched\r\ntravesty of the forms of justice,'' nor did he conceal his\r\n``indignation at the bloody outrages and shocking wrongs inflicted\r\nupon a body of your countrymen,'' and his mortification\r\nthat ``such a blot should have been cast upon the record of our\r\nGovernment.'' There was sarcastic significance in the cartoon\r\nof the Chicago Inter-Ocean representing a Chinese reading a\r\ndaily paper one of whose columns was headed ``Massacre of\r\nAmericans in China,'' while the other column bore the heading,\r\n``Massacre of Chinese in America.'' Uncle Sam stands at his\r\nelbow and ejaculates, ``Horrible, isn't it?'' To which the\r\nCelestial blandly inquires, ``Which?''\r\n\r\nIn the North American Review for March, 1904, Mr.\r\nWong Kai Kah, an educated Chinese gentleman, plainly but\r\ncourteously discusses this subject under the caption of ``A\r\nMenace to America's Oriental Trade.'' He justly complains\r\nthat though the exclusion law expressly exempts Chinese\r\nmerchants, students and travellers, yet as a matter of fact a\r\nChinese gentleman is treated on his arrival as if he were a\r\ncriminal and is ``detained in the pen on the steamship wharf\r\nor imprisoned like a felon until the customs officials are\r\nsatisfied.''\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Chester Holcombe, formerly Secretary of the\r\nAmerican Legation at Peking and a member of the Chinese\r\nImmigration Commission of 1880, cites some illlustrations of\r\nthe harshness and unreasonableness of the exclusion law.[45] A\r\nChinese merchant of San Francisco visited his native land and\r\nbrought back a bride, only to find that she was forbidden to\r\nland on American soil. Another Chinese merchant and wife,\r\nof unquestioned standing in San Francisco, made a trip to\r\nChina, and while there a child was born. On returning to\r\ntheir home in America, the sapient officials could interpose no\r\nobjection to the readmission of the parents, but peremptorily\r\nrefused to admit the three-months old baby, as, never having\r\nbeen in this country, it had no right to enter it! Neither of\r\nthese preposterous decisions could be charged to the stupidity\r\nor malice of the local officials, for both were appealed to the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury in Washington and were officially\r\nsustained by him as in accordance with the law, though in the\r\nlatter case, the Secretary, then the Hon. Daniel Manning, in\r\napproving the action, had the courageous good sense to write:\r\n``Burn all this correspondence, let the poor little baby go\r\nashore, and don't make a fool of yourself.''\r\n\r\n\r\n[45] Article in The Outlook, April 23, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\nStill more irritating and insulting, if that were possible, was\r\nthe treatment of the Chinese exhibitors at the Louisiana Purchase\r\nExposition at St. Louis in 1904. Our Government\r\nformally invited China to participate, sending a special\r\ncommission to Peking to urge acceptance. China accepted in\r\ngood faith, and then the Treasury Department in Washington\r\ndrew up a series of regulations requiring\r\n``that each exhibitor, upon arrival at any seaport in this country, should\r\nbe photographed three times for purposes of identification, and should\r\nfile a bond in the penal sum of $5,000, the conditions of which were that\r\nhe would proceed directly and by the shortest route to St. Louis, would\r\nnot leave the Exposition grounds at any time after his arrival there, and\r\nwould depart for China by the first steamer sailing after the close of the\r\nExposition. Thus a sort of Chinese rogues' gallery was to be established\r\nat each port, and the Fair grounds were to be made a prison pen for\r\nthose who had come here as invited guests of the nation, whose\r\npresence and aid were needed to make the display a success. It is only\r\njust to add that, upon a most vigorous protest made against these courteous(?)\r\nregulations by the Chinese Government and a threat to cancel their acceptance\r\nor our invitation, the rules were withdrawn and others more decent\r\nsubstituted. But the fact that they were prepared and seriously presented\r\nto China shows to what an extent of injustice and discourtesy our mistaken\r\nattitude and action in regard to Chinese immigration has carried\r\nus.''\r\n\r\n\r\nNo right-minded American can read without poignant shame,\r\nLuella Miner's recent account[46] of the experiences of Fay Chi\r\nHo and Kung Hsiang Hsi, two Chinese students who, after\r\nshowing magnificent devotion to American missionaries during\r\nthe horrors of the Boxer massacres, sought to enter the United\r\nStates. They were young men of education and Christian\r\ncharacter who wished to complete their education at Oberlin\r\nCollege, but they were treated by the United States officials at\r\nSan Francisco and other cities with a suspicion and brutality\r\nthat were ``more worthy of Turkey than of free Christian\r\nAmerica.'' Arriving at the Golden Gate, September 12, 1901,\r\nit was not until January 10, 1903, that they succeeded in\r\nreaching Oberlin, and those sixteen months were filled with indignities\r\nfrom which all the efforts of influential friends and of\r\nthe Chinese Minister to the United States were unable to protect\r\nthem. Whatever reasons there may be for excluding\r\ncoolie labourers, there can be none for excluding the bright\r\nyoung men who come here to study. ``An open door for our\r\nmerchants, our railway projectors, our missionaries, we cry,\r\nand at the same time we slam the door in the faces of Chinese\r\nmerchants and travellers and students--the best classes who\r\nseek our shores.''\r\n\r\n\r\n[46] ``Two Heroes of Cathay,'' p. 223 sq.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fear that the Chinese would inundate the United States\r\nif they were permitted to come under the same conditions as\r\nEuropeans is not justified by the numbers that came before the\r\nexclusion laws became so stringent, the total Chinese population\r\nof the United States up to 1880, when there was no obstacle\r\nto their coming except the general immigration law, being\r\nonly 105,465--the merest handful among our scores of\r\nmillions of people. The objections that they are addicted to\r\ngambling and immorality, that they come only for temporary\r\nmercenary purposes and that they do not become members of\r\nthe body politic but segregate themselves in special communities,\r\nmight be urged with equal justice by the Chinese\r\nagainst the foreign communities in the port cities of China.\r\nSegregating themselves, indeed! How can the Chinese help\r\nthemselves, when they are not allowed to become naturalized\r\nand are treated with a dislike and contempt which force them\r\nback upon one another?\r\n\r\nAs for the charge that they teach the opium habit to white\r\nboys and girls, it may be safely affirmed that all the Americans\r\nwho have acquired that dread habit from the Chinese are not\r\nequal to a tenth of the number of Chinese women and girls\r\nwho have been given foul diseases by white men in China.\r\nMr. Holcombe declares:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``Our unfair treatment of China in this business will some day return\r\nto plague us. Entirely aside from the cavalier and insulting manner with\r\nwhich we have dealt with China, and the inevitably injurious effect upon\r\nour relations and interests there, it must be said that our action has been\r\nundignified, unworthy of any great nation, a sad criticism upon our sense\r\nof power and ability to rule our affairs with wisdom and moderation, and\r\nunbecoming our high position among the leading governments of the\r\nworld. . . . We have treated Chinese immigrants--never more than\r\na handful when compared with our population--as though we were in a\r\nfrenzy of fear of them. We have forsaken our wits in this question,\r\nabandoned all self-control, and belittled our manhood by treating each\r\nincoming Chinaman as though he were the embodiment of some huge and\r\nhideous power which, once landed upon our shores, could not be dealt\r\nwith or kept within bounds. Yet in point of fact he is far more easily\r\nkept in bounds and held obedient to law than some immigrants from Europe.\r\n. . . It must be admitted as beyond question that the coming\r\nof the Chinese to these shores should be held under constant supervision\r\nand strict limitations. And so should immigration from all other countries.\r\nThe time has come when we ought to pick and choose with far\r\ngreater care than is exercised, and to exclude large numbers who are now\r\nadmitted.... It is this discrimination alone which is unjust to\r\nChina, which she naturally resents, and which does us serious harm in our\r\nrelations with her people.''\r\n\r\n\r\nCommenting on the regulations promulgated by the Secretary\r\nof Commerce and Labour, July 27, 1903, regarding the\r\nadmission of Chinese, the Hon. David J. Brewer, Associate\r\nJustice of the Supreme Court of the United States, declared:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``Can anything be more harsh and arbitrary? Coming into a port of\r\nthe United States, as these petitioners did into the port of Malone, placed\r\nas they were in a house of detention, shut off from communication with\r\nfriends and counsel, examined before an inspector with no one to advise or\r\ncounsel, only such witnesses present as the inspector may designate, and\r\nupon an adverse decision compelled to give notice of appeal within two\r\ndays, within three days the transcript forwarded to the Commissioner-\r\nGeneral, and nothing to be considered by him except the testimony obtained\r\nin this star chamber proceeding. This is called due process of\r\nlaw to protect the rights of an American citizen, and sufficient to prevent\r\ninquiry in the courts....\r\n\r\n``Must an American citizen, seeking to return to this his native land, be\r\ncompelled to bring with him two witnesses to prove the place of his birth\r\nor else be denied his right to return, and all opportunity of establishing\r\nhis citizenship in the courts of his country? No such rule is enforced\r\nagainst an American citizen of Anglo-Saxon descent, and if this be, as\r\nclaimed, a government of laws and not of men, I do not think it should\r\nbe enforced against American citizens of Chinese descent....\r\n\r\n``Finally, let me say that the time has been when many young men\r\nfrom China came to our educational institutions to pursue their studies\r\nwhen her commerce sought our shores and her people came to build our\r\nrailroads, and when China looked upon this country as her best friend.\r\nIf all this be reversed and the most populous nation on earth becomes the\r\ngreat antagonist of this Republic, the careful student of history will recall\r\nthe words of Scripture, `they have sown the wind, and they shall reap\r\nthe whirlwind,' and for cause of such antagonism need look no further\r\nthan the treatment accorded during the last twenty years by this country\r\nto the people of that nation.''[47]\r\n\r\n\r\n[47] Dissenting opinion in the case of the United States, Petitioner vs.\r\nSing Tuck or King Do and thirty-one others, April 25, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that while Chinese students are turning\r\nin large numbers to other lands, there are only 146 in the\r\nUnited States. It is a serious matter and it may have a far\r\nreaching effect upon the future of China and of mankind when\r\nthe coming men of the Far East, desiring to place themselves in\r\ntouch with modern conditions, are compelled to avoid the one\r\nChristian nation in all the world which boasts the most enlightened\r\ninstitutions and the highest development of liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mr. E. H. Parker rather sarcastically remarks:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``The United States have always been somewhat prone to pose as the good\r\nand disinterested friend of China, who does not sell opium or exercise any\r\nundue political influence. These claims to the exceptional status of all\r\nhonest broker have been a little shaken by the sharp treatment of Chinese\r\nin the United States, Honolulu and Manila.''[48]\r\n\r\n\r\n[48] ``China,'' p. 105.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government long expostulated against the barbarity\r\nand injustice of the exclusion laws and finally, finding\r\nexpostulations of no avail, the scholars and merchants of China\r\norganized in 1905 a boycott against American trade. This\r\nquickly brought public feeling in the United States to its\r\nsenses. President Roosevelt sternly ordered all local officials\r\nto be humane and sensible in their enforcement of the law under\r\npain of instant dismissal, and the press began to demand a new\r\ntreaty. It is gratifying to know that in the future Chinese\r\nimmigrants are likely to be more justly treated, but it is not\r\npleasant to reflect that the American people apparently cared\r\nlittle about the iniquity of their anti-Chinese laws until Chinese\r\nresentment touched their pockets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nDIPLOMATIC RELATIONS--TREATIES\r\n\r\nIN view of some of the facts presented in the two preceding\r\nchapters, it is not surprising that the efforts of foreign\r\npowers to establish diplomatic relations with the Chinese\r\nGovernment were rather tempestuous. A full account of the\r\nnegotiations would require a separate volume. For two generations,\r\nnation after nation sought to protect its growing interests\r\nin China and to secure recognition from the Chinese Government,\r\nonly to be met by opposition that was sometimes courteous\r\nand sometimes sullen, but always inflexible until it was\r\nbroken down by force. Each envoy on presenting his letters\r\nwas politely told in substance that the Chinese official concerned\r\nwas extremely busy, that to his deep regret it would not\r\nbe possible to grant an immediate conference, but that as soon\r\nas possible he would have pleasure in selecting a ``felicitous\r\nday'' on which they could hold a ``pleasant interview'';[49] and\r\nwhen the envoys, worn out by the never-ending procrastination,\r\nfinally gave up in disgust and announced their intention of returning\r\nhome, the typical Chinese official blandly replied, as\r\nthe notorious Yeh did to United States Minister Marshall in\r\nJanuary, 1854,--``I avail myself of the occasion to present my\r\ncompliments, and trust that, of late, your blessings have been\r\nincreasingly tranquil.''[50]\r\n\r\n\r\n[49] Foster, ``American Diplomacy in the Orient,'' p. 205,\r\n\r\n[50] Foster, p. 213.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScores of European and American diplomatic agents had\r\nsubstantially the same experience. United States Minister\r\nReed, in 1858, truly said that the replies of the Chinese to the\r\nmemorials and letters of the foreign envoys were characterized\r\nby ``the same unmeaning profession, the same dexterous\r\nsophistry; and, what is more material, the same passive resistance;\r\nthe same stolid refusal to yield any point of substance.''[51]\r\n\r\n\r\n[51] Foster, p. 236.\r\n\r\n\r\nNor can it be denied that the Chinese had some ground for\r\nholding foreign nations at arms' length as long as they could,\r\nfor with a few exceptions, prominent among whom were some\r\nAmerican ministers, notably Mr. Burlingame, the foreign\r\nenvoys were far from being tactful and conciliatory in their\r\nmethods of approach to a proud and ancient people. Mr.\r\nFoster reminds us that in the negotiations which terminated in\r\nthe treaty of 1858,\r\n\r\n\r\n``The British were pushing demands not insisted upon by the other\r\nPowers, and they could only be obtained by coercive measures. The reports\r\nin the Blue Books and the London newspapers show that Mr. Lay,\r\nwho personally conducted the negotiations for Lord Elgin, when he found\r\nthe Chinese commissioners obdurate, was accustomed to raise his voice,\r\ncharge them with having `violated their pledged word,' and threaten\r\nthem with Lord Elgin's displeasure and the march of the British troops to\r\nPeking. And when this failed to bring them to terms, a strong detachment\r\nof the British army was marched through Tien-tsin to strike terror\r\ninto its officials and inhabitants. Lord Elgin in his diary records the climax\r\nof these demonstrations: `I have not written for some days, but they\r\nhave been busy ones. We went on fighting and bullying, and getting the\r\npoor commissioners to concede one point after another, till Friday the\r\n25th.' The next day the treaty was signed, and he closes the record as\r\nfollows: `Though I have been forced to act almost brutally, I am China's\r\nfriend in all this.' There can be no doubt that notwithstanding the seeming\r\nparadox, Lord Elgin was thoroughly sincere in this declaration, and\r\nthat his entire conduct was influenced by a high sense of duty and by\r\nwhat he regarded as the best interests of China.''[52]\r\n\r\n\r\n[52] ``American Diplomacy in the Orient,'' pp. 241, 242.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut can we wonder that the Chinese were irritated and humiliated\r\nby the method adopted?\r\n\r\nThat treaty of 1858 gave some notable advantages to foreigners,\r\nfor it conceded the rights of foreign nations to send diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives to Peking, the rights of foreigners to\r\ntravel, trade, buy, sell and reside in an increasing number of\r\nplaces, and on the persistent initiative of the French envoy,\r\npowerfully supported by the famous Dr. S. Wells Williams,\r\nChristianity was especially recognized, and the protection, not\r\nonly of missionaries but all Chinese converts to Christianity,\r\nwas specifically guaranteed. Of course, by the convenient\r\n``most favoured nation clause'' any concession obtained by\r\none country, was immediately claimed by all other countries.\r\n\r\nIt was this treaty which included the famous Toleration\r\nClause regarding Christian missions as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n``The principles of the Christian religion, as professed by the Protestant\r\nand Roman Catholic Churches, are recognized as teaching men to do good,\r\nand to do to others as they would have others do to them. Hereafter\r\nthose who quietly profess and teach these doctrines shall not be harassed\r\nor persecuted on account of their faith. Any person, whether citizen of the\r\nUnited States or Chinese convert, who, according to these tenets, shall\r\npeaceably teach and practice the principles of Christianity shall in no\r\ncase be interfered with or molested.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThe charge has been made that the toleration clauses were\r\nsmuggled into the treaties without the knowledge of the Chinese,\r\nso that the claims to recognition and protection which were\r\nsubsequently based upon it rest upon an unfair foundation. It\r\nis indeed possible, as Dr. S. Wells Williams, the author, frankly\r\nadmits[53] ``that if the Chinese had at all comprehended what\r\nwas involved in these four toleration articles, they would never\r\nhave signed one of them.'' But perhaps the same thing might\r\nbe said of most treaties that have been signed in Asia. The\r\nfact remains, however, that the articles referred to were not\r\nplaced in them without the knowledge of the Chinese. Dr.\r\nWilliams explicitly states that he and the Rev. Dr. W. A. P.\r\nMartin, called upon the Chinese Commissioners and that\r\n\r\n``some of the articles of our draft were passed without objection, those\r\nrelating to toleration (of Christianity in China) and the payment of claims\r\nwere copied off to show the Commissioner, those permitting and regulating\r\nvisits to Peking were rejected, and others were amended, the colloquy\r\nbeing conducted with considerable animation and constant good humour\r\non his part.''[54]\r\n\r\n\r\n[53] ``The Life and Letters of Samuel Wells Williams, LL. D.,'' p. 271.\r\n\r\n[54] ``The Life and Letters of Samuel Wells Williams, LL. D.,'' p. 261.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a letter written many years afterwards and dated New\r\nHaven, September 12, 1878, Dr. Williams states that the first\r\ndraft of the Toleration Clauses was rejected by the Chinese\r\nCommissioners, as he believes at the instigation of the French\r\nLegation, because the clause recognized Protestant missions.\r\nDr. Williams then states that as soon as he could, he drew up\r\nanother form of the same article and laid it before the Chinese\r\nImperial Commissioners. He writes:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``It was quite the same article as before, but they accepted it without\r\nany further discussion or alteration; however, the word `whoever' in\r\nmy English version was altered by Mr. Reed to `any person, whether citizen\r\nof the United States, or Chinese convert, who'--because he wished\r\nevery part of the treaty to refer to United States citizens, and cared not\r\nvery much whether it had a toleration article or not. I did care, and was\r\nthankful to God that it was inserted. It is the only treaty in existence\r\nwhich contains the royal law.''\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Williams' Journal for June 18, 1858, the following\r\nrecord appears:\r\n\r\n\r\n``I went to sleep last night with the impression that after such a reply\r\nfrom the Minister it would be vain to urge a new draft, but after a restless\r\nsleep I awoke to the idea of trying once more, this time saying nothing\r\nabout foreign missionaries. The article was sketched as soon as I could\r\nwrite it and sent off by a messenger before breakfast; it was a last\r\nchance, and every hope went with it for success. At half-past nine an\r\nanswer came. Permission for Christians meeting for worship and the distribution\r\nof books was erased, while the words open ports were inserted\r\nin such a connection that it was rendered illegal for any one, native or\r\notherwise, to profess Christianity anywhere else. The design was merely\r\nto restrict missionaries to the ports, but the effect would be detrimental in\r\nthe highest degree to natives. I decided at once to go to see the Viscount\r\nand try to settle the question with him personally. Chairs were\r\ncalled, whose bearers seemed to Martin and me an eternity in coming, but\r\nat last we reached the house where Captain Du Pont and his marines so\r\nunexpectedly turned up last Saturday. Our amendment was handed to\r\nChang, who began to cavil at it, but he was promptly told that he must\r\ntake it to the Commissioners for approval as it stood, since this was the\r\nform we were decided on. Our labour and anxiety were all repaid, and\r\nended by his return in a few minutes announcing Kweilang's assent to\r\nthe article as it now stands in the treaty.''\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to settle this point beyond all possible doubt, I recently\r\nwrote to the Rev. Dr. W. A. P. Martin, now in China,\r\nasking him to give me his recollection of the incident. He replied\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``The charge that the toleration article was `smuggled into the treaty\r\nof 1858' is so far from the truth that those who make it can be shown to\r\nbe either superficial or uncandid. If it means that `the Chinese did not\r\nknow what they were agreeing to, I answer that they could have no\r\nexcuse for ignorance. An edict granting toleration had been issued as\r\nearly as 1845. This had been followed by more than ten years of missionary\r\nwork at the newly opened ports--quite sufficient to make them\r\nacquainted with the character of Protestant missions. Of Roman Catholic\r\nmissions prior to the edict, they had centuries of experience. Moreover,\r\nduring our negotiations at Tien-tsin, they had ample time for a fresh study\r\nof the subject, the draft of our treaty being under daily discussion for more\r\nthan a week before it was signed. Nor was our draft the first to bring up\r\nthe question of toleration. The Russian Treaty signed on June 13th (five\r\ndays in advance of ours) contained one explicit provision for the toleration\r\nof Christianity under the form of the Greek Church; but it made no\r\nreference to Protestant or Roman Catholic. Not only was the American\r\nTreaty the first to give these a legal status, it gives the Chinese a sample\r\nof Christian teaching in the Golden Rule, which Dr. Williams inserted in\r\nthe article expressly to show them what they were agreeing to. Never\r\nwere negotiations more open and above board. In their earlier stages I\r\ngave a copy of my book on the Evidences of Christianity to Jushon, one of\r\nthe deputies, who was so much pleased with it, that he became my friend\r\nand greeted me warmly on my removal to Peking. That the Chinese\r\nMinisters had any conception of the new force they were admitting into\r\ntheir country, I do not assert; but I hold strongly that this spiritual force\r\nis the only thing that can raise the Chinese people out of their present\r\nstate of semi-barbarism.\r\n                         ``W. A. P. MARTIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n``Wuchang, China, February 18, 1904.''\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1861, that legations were established in\r\nPeking. But while this gave foreign nations a solid foothold\r\nat the capital, it did not by any means give them the recognition\r\nthat they demanded, for their intercourse with the court\r\nwas still hedged about with innumerable exactions and indignities.\r\nThe Hon. Thomas Francis Wade, British Minister at\r\nPeking, in a long note to the Chinese Minister Wen Hsiang,\r\ndated June 18, 1871, discussing the troubles that had arisen\r\nbetween the Chinese and foreigners, justly said:\r\n\r\n\r\n``It is quite impossible that China should ever attain to a just appreciation\r\nof what foreign Powers expect of her, or that she should insure from\r\nforeign Powers what she conceives due to her, until she have honestly\r\naccepted the conditions of official intercourse which are the sole guarantees\r\nagainst international differences. The chief of these is an interchange\r\nof representatives. I do not say that it is a panacea for all evil; but it is\r\nincontestable that without it wars would be of far more frequent recurrence,\r\nand till China is represented in the West, I see no hope of our ever\r\nhaving done with the incessant recriminations and bickerings between the\r\nYamen and foreign legations, by which the lives of diplomatic agents in\r\nPeking are made weary. If China is wronged, she must make herself\r\nheard; and, on the other hand, if she would abstain from giving offense,\r\nshe must learn what is passing in the world beyond her.''\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government was slow in coming to this view,\r\nbut western nations steadily persisted. One by one new concessions\r\nwere wrung from the reluctant Chinese. Mr. E. H.\r\nParker[55] has tabulated as follows the treaties of foreign powers\r\nwith China from 1689 to 1898:--\r\n\r\n\r\n[55] ``China,'' pp. 113-115.\r\n\r\n\r\n{Pages 171 to 173 are these tables... They are formatted landscape-wise on\r\nthe pages and should be typed in a viewable format or added as an image file.}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nRENEWED AGGRESSIONS\r\n\r\nNOT content with innumerable aggressions and\r\nextorted treaty concessions, Western nations boldly\r\ndiscussed the dismemberment of China as certain to\r\ncome, and authors and journalists disputed as to which country\r\nshould possess the richest parts of the Empire whose impotence\r\nto defend itself was taken for granted. Chinese ministers in\r\nEurope and America reported these discussions to their superiors\r\nin Peking. The English papers in China republished\r\nsome of the articles and added many effective ones of their\r\nown, so that speedily all the better-informed Chinese came to\r\nknow that foreigners regarded China as ``the carcass of the\r\nEast.''\r\n\r\nNor was all this talk empty boasting. China saw that France\r\nwas absorbing Siam and had designs on Syria; that Britain was\r\nalready lord of India and Egypt and the Straits Settlements;\r\nthat Germany was pressing her claims in Asiatic Turkey; that\r\nRussia had absorbed Siberia and was striving to obtain control\r\nof Palestine, Persia and Korea; and that Italy was trying to\r\ntake Abyssinia. Moreover the Chinese perceived that of the\r\nnumerous islands of the world, France had the Loyalty, Society,\r\nMarquesas, New Hebrides and New Caledonia groups, and\r\nclaimed the Taumotu or Low Archipelago; that Great Britain\r\nhad the Fiji, Cook, Gilbert, Ellice, Phoenix, Tokelan and New\r\nZealand groups, with northern Borneo, Tasmania, and the\r\nwhole of continental Australia, besides a large assortment of\r\nmiscellaneous islands scattered over the world wherever they\r\nwould do the most good; that Germany possessed the Marshall\r\ngroup and Northeast New Guinea, and divided with England\r\nthe Solomons; that Spain had the Ladrones, the 652 islands\r\nof the Carolines, the 1,725 more or less of the Philippines,\r\nbeside some enormously valuable holdings in the West Indies;\r\nthat the Dutch absolutely ruled Java, Sumatra, the greater part\r\nof Borneo, all of Celebes and the hundreds of islands eastward\r\nto New Guinea, half of which was under the Dutch flag; that\r\nthe new world power on the American continent took the\r\nHawaiian Islands and in two swift campaigns drove Spain out\r\nof the West Indies and the Philippines, not to return them to\r\ntheir inhabitants but to keep them herself; and that in the\r\nSamoan and Friendly Islands, resident foreigners owned about\r\neverything worth having and left to the native chiefs only what\r\nthe foreigners did not want or could not agree upon. As for\r\nmighty Africa, the Berlin Conference of 1884 was the signal\r\nfor a game of grab on so colossal a scale that to-day out of\r\nAfrica's 11,980,000 square miles, France owns 3,074,000,\r\nGreat Britain 2,818,000, Turkey 1,672,000, Belgium 900,000,\r\nPortugal 834,000, Germany 864,000, Italy 596,000, and Spain\r\n263,000,--a total of 10,980,000, or ten-elevenths of the whole\r\ncontinent, and doubtless the Powers will take the remaining\r\neleventh whenever they feel like it. Well does the Rev. Dr.\r\nJames Stewart call this ``the most stupendous and unparalleled\r\npartition of the earth's surface ever known in the world's\r\nhistory. . . . The vast area was partitioned, annexed, appropriated,\r\nor converted into `spheres of influence,' or `spheres\r\nof interest'; whatever may be the exact words we may use,\r\nthe result is the same. Coast lands and hinterlands all went\r\nin this great appropriation, and mild is the term for the deed.''[56]\r\n\r\n\r\n[56] ``Dawn in the Dark Continent,'' pp. 17, 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n``Gobbling the globe,'' this process has been forcefully if\r\ninelegantly termed. No wonder that the white race has been\r\nbitterly described as ``the most arrogant and rapacious, the\r\nmost exclusive and intolerant race in history.''\r\n\r\nWe can understand, therefore, the alarm of the Chinese as\r\nthey saw the greedy foreigners descend upon their own shores\r\nin such ways as to justify the fear that what remained of the\r\nCelestial Empire, too, would be speedily reduced to vassalage.\r\nGermany, which was among the last of the European powers\r\nto obtain a foothold in China, but which had been growing\r\nmore and more uneasy as she saw the acquisitions of her rivals,\r\nsuddenly found her opportunity in the murder of two German\r\nRoman Catholic priests in the province of Shantung, December\r\n1897, and on the 14th of that month Admiral Diedrich landed\r\nmarines at Kiao-chou Bay. At that time nothing but a few\r\nstraggling, poverty-stricken Chinese villages were to be seen at\r\nthe foot of the barren hills bordering the bay. But the keen\r\neye of Germany had detected the possibilities of the place and\r\nearly in the following year, under the forms of an enforced\r\nninety-nine year lease, Germany took this splendid harbour\r\nand the territory bordering it, and at Tsing-tau began to push\r\nher interests so aggressively that the whole province of Shantung\r\nwas thrown into the most intense excitement and alarm.\r\n\r\nKnowing how recently the city had been founded, I looked\r\nupon it with wonder. It was only three years and a half since\r\nthe Germans had taken possession, but no boom city in the\r\nUnited States ever made more rapid progress in so short a\r\nperiod. Not a Chinese house could be seen, except a village\r\nin the distance. But along the shores rose a city of modern\r\nbuildings with banks, department stores, public buildings, comfortable\r\nresidences, a large church and imposing marine barracks.\r\nLanding, I found broad streets, some of them already\r\nwell paved and others being paved by removing the dirt to a\r\ndepth of twelve inches and then filling the excavation solid\r\nwith broken rock. The gutters were wide and of stone, the\r\nsewers deep and, in some cases, cut through the solid rock.\r\n\r\nThe city was under naval control, the German Governor\r\nbeing a naval officer. Several war-ships were lying in the harbour.\r\nA large force of marines was on shore, and the hills\r\ncommanding the city and harbour were bristling with cannon.\r\nThe Germans were spending money without stint. No less\r\nthan 11,000,000 marks were being expended that year for\r\nstreets, sewers, water and electric light works, barracks, fortifications,\r\nwharves, a handsome hotel and public buildings, while\r\nthe Government had appropriated 50,000,000 Mex. (5,000,000\r\na year for ten years) for deepening and enlarging the inner\r\nharbour. But in addition to these Government expenditures,\r\nmany enterprising business men were undertaking large enterprises\r\non their own account. It was apparent to the most\r\ncasual observer that Germany had entered Shantung to stay\r\nand that she considered the whole vast province of Shantung\r\nas her sphere of influence. The railway, already referred to\r\nin a former chapter, was being constructed into the interior\r\nwith solid road-bed, steel ties and substantial stone stations.\r\nGerman mining engineers were prospecting for minerals and\r\neverything indicated large plans for a permanent occupation.\r\n\r\nThe site of Tsing-tau is beautiful and exceptionally healthful.\r\nWhile the ports of Teng-chou and Chefoo are also in Shantung,\r\nthe first is now of little importance, for it is on the northeastern\r\npart of the promontory with a mountain range behind\r\nit so that it is difficult of access from the interior. Chefoo,\r\nwhich was not opened as a port until later, rapidly superseded\r\nTeng-chou in importance and continues to grow with great\r\nrapidity. But it is plain that the Germans intend to make\r\nTsing-tau, only twenty hours distant by steamer, the chief port\r\nof Shantung, and as they have the railroad, they will doubtless\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\nFrom hundreds of outlying villages, the Chinese are flocking\r\ninto Tsing-tau, attracted by the remunerative employment\r\nwhich the Germans offer, for of course, tens of thousands of\r\nlabourers are necessary to carry out the extensive improvements\r\nthat are planned. The thrifty Chinese are quite willing to\r\ntake the foreigner's money, however much they may dislike\r\nhim. Since the white man is here, we might as well get what\r\nwe can out of him, the Celestials philosophically argue. And\r\nso the Germans, who had ruthlessly destroyed the old, unsani-\r\ntary Chinese villages which they had found on their arrival,\r\nlaid out model Chinese villages on the outskirts of the city.\r\nThe new Chinese city is about two and a half miles from the\r\nforeign city and is connected with it by a splendid macadamized\r\nroad for which the Germans filled ravines, cut through\r\nthe solid rock of the hillsides and made retaining walls and\r\nculverts of solid masonry. Some of the old stone houses were\r\nallowed to remain, but many of the poorer houses were demolished,\r\nstreets were straightened and the whole city placed under\r\nstrict sanitary supervision. The Chinese as they came in were\r\ntold where and how their houses must be erected on the regularly\r\nlaid out streets. The houses are numbered and many\r\nof the stores have signs in both German and Chinese. At the\r\ntime of my visit, the Chinese city had a population of 8,000,\r\nthe streets were crowded, and marketing, picture and theatrical\r\nexhibitions and all the forms of life, so common in Chinese\r\ncities, were to be seen on every side. Since then, the population\r\nhas greatly increased, while another Chinese city has been\r\nlaid out on the open ground on the other side of the foreign\r\ncity. There is every indication that Tsing-tau is to become\r\none of the great port cities of China, and the opportunities for\r\ntrade, the coming of steamships and the construction of the\r\nrailway are making it an attractive place to multitudes of\r\nambitious Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe German Government owns all the land in and about\r\nTsing-tau, and will not sell save on condition that approved\r\nbuildings are erected within three years. The single tax\r\nplan has been adopted, that is, there is no tax on buildings\r\nbut there is a six per cent. tax on all land that is sold. This\r\nshuts out the land speculator who has injured so many American\r\ncities. No man can buy cheap land and let it lie idle while\r\nit rises in value as the result of his neighbour's improvements and\r\nthe growth of the community. The German Government will\r\ndo its own speculating and reap for itself the increment of its\r\ncostly and elaborate improvements. It is making a noble city.\r\nStreets, sewers, buildings, docks, sea walls, harbour-dredging,\r\ntree planting--all point to great and far-reaching plans, while\r\nunder pretext of guarding the railroad, troops are being gradually\r\npushed into the interior. The Kaomi garrison, in the hinterland\r\neighteen miles beyond the Kiao-chou city line and sixty-\r\nfour from Tsing-tau, consisted of 100 men when I was there\r\nin the spring of 1901. A few months later it was 1,000.\r\nPlainly the Germans are moving in.\r\n\r\nThe ease and dispatch with which Germany succeeded in\r\nobtaining an enormously valuable strategic point in the rich\r\nprovince of Shangtung aroused the cupidity of rival nations,\r\nand they threw off all pretense to decency in their scramble for\r\nfurther territories. Russian statesmen had long ago seen that\r\nthe Pacific Ocean was to be the arena of world events of colossal\r\nsignificance to the race. We have noted in a former chapter\r\nhow she had already extended her territory till she touched\r\nthe Pacific Ocean on the far north and how, partly that she\r\nmight develop it, but primarily that she might have a highway\r\nthrough it to the great ocean which lies beyond, she had begun\r\nthe construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway, the late Czar,\r\nAlexander III, guaranteeing out of his own private funds\r\n350,000,000 rubles towards the necessary expense. The most\r\nsouthern port of Russia on the Pacific Ocean was Vladivostok,\r\nwhich was therefore made the terminus of the line and rapidly\r\nand strongly fortified. But Russia was not content with a\r\nharbour which is closed by ice six months in the year. She\r\ntherefore began to press her way southward through Manchuria.\r\nIn November, 1894, Japan had wrested from China the peninsula\r\nterminating in Port Arthur, and the treaty of Shimonoseki,\r\nat the close of the war, had given Japan the Liao-tung peninsula,\r\nopened four Manchurian ports to foreign trade, and conceded\r\nto Japan valuable commercial rights in Manchuria,\r\nrights which gave the Japanese virtual ascendancy. Ostensibly\r\nin the interests of China, but really of her own ambition,\r\nRussia gravely said that it would never do to permit Japan to\r\nremain in Manchuria, virtuously declaring that ``the integrity\r\nof China must be preserved at all costs.'' She persuaded\r\nFrance and Germany to join her in notifying the Japanese\r\nGovernment that ``it would not be permitted to retain permanent\r\npossession of any portion of the mainland of Asia.''\r\nJapan, feeling at that time unprepared to fight three European\r\npowers, was forced to relinquish the prize of victory. The\r\nsolicitude of Russia for the integrity of helpless China was\r\nquite touching, but it did not prevent her from making one\r\nencroachment after another upon the coveted territory until\r\nMarch 8, 1898, to the rage and chagrin of Japan, she peremptorily\r\ndemanded for herself and March 27th of the same year\r\nobtained Port Arthur including Ta-lien-wan and 800 square\r\nmiles of adjoining territory. She speciously declared that\r\n``her occupation of Port Arthur was merely temporary and\r\nonly to secure a harbour for wintering the Russian fleet.'' But\r\ngrim significance was given to her action by the prompt appearance\r\nat Port Arthur of 20,000 Russian soldiers and 90,000\r\ncoolies who were set to work developing a great modern fortification\r\nalmost under the eyes of the Chinese capital.\r\n\r\nAs it was expedient, however, to have a commercial city on\r\nthe peninsula as well as a fortification, as the harbour of Port\r\nArthur was not large enough for both naval and commercial\r\npurposes, and as the Russians did not wish anyway to make\r\ntheir fortified base accessible to the rest of the world, they decided\r\nto build a city forty-five miles north of Port Arthur and\r\ncall it Dalny, which quite appropriately means ``far away.''\r\nMost cities grow, but this was too slow a method for the\r\npurpose of the Slav, and therefore, a metropolis was forthwith\r\nmade to order as a result of an edict issued by the Czar,\r\nJuly 30, 1899.\r\n\r\nThe harbour of Dalny is an exceptionally fine one with over\r\nthirty feet of water at low tide so that the largest vessels can\r\nlie alongside the docks and transfer their cargoes directly to\r\ntrains for Europe. Great piers were constructed; enormous\r\nwarehouses and elevators erected; gas, electric light, water and\r\nstreet-car plants installed; wide and well-sewered streets laid\r\nout; and a thoroughly modern and handsome city planned in\r\nfour sections, the first of which was administrative, the second\r\nmercantile, the third residence, and the fourth Chinese. The\r\nRussians were sparing neither labour nor expense in the construction\r\nof this ambitious city which, by January, 1904, already\r\nhad a population of over 50,000, and represented a reported\r\nexpenditure of about $150,000,000. April 9, 1902,\r\nRussia solemnly promised to evacuate Manchuria October 8,\r\n1903. But when that day came, she remained, as every one\r\nknew that she would, under the unblushing pretext that Manchuria\r\nwas not yet sufficiently pacified to justify her withdrawal\r\nfrom a region where her interests were so great. As\r\nManchuria was at the time as quiet as some of Russia's\r\nEuropean provinces, the reason alleged reminds one of the\r\nArab's reply to a man who wished to borrow his rope--``I\r\nneed it myself to tie up some sand with.'' ``But,'' expostulated\r\nthe would-be borrower, ``that is a poor excuse for you\r\ncannot tie up sand with a rope.'' ``I know that,'' was the\r\ncalm rejoinder, ``but any excuse will serve when I don't want\r\nto do a thing.'' So to the concern of China, the envy of\r\nEurope and the wrath of Japan, Manchuria practically became\r\na Russian province until Japan, unable to restrain her exasperation\r\nlonger and feeling that Russia's plans were a menace to\r\nher own safety, had developed her army and navy and begun\r\nthe war which not only arrested the advance of the Slav but\r\nexpelled him from most of the territory he had seized.\r\n\r\nNot to be outdone by Germany and Russia, other nations\r\nmade haste to seize what they could find. April 2, 1898,\r\nEngland secured the lease of Lin-kung, with all the islands\r\nand a strip ten miles wide on the mainland, thus giving the\r\nBritish a strong post at Wei-hai Wei. April 22d, France peremptorily\r\ndemanded, and May 2d obtained, the bay of Kwangchou-wan,\r\nwhile Japan found her share in a concession for\r\nFoochow, Woosung, Fan-ning, Yo-chou and Chung-wan-tao.\r\nBy 1899, in all China's 3,000 miles of coast line, there was not\r\na harbour in which she could mobilize her own ships without\r\nthe consent of the hated foreigner.\r\n\r\nA clever Chinese artist in Hongkong grimly drew a cartoon\r\nof the situation of his country as he and his countrymen\r\nsaw it. The Russian Bear, coming down from the north,\r\nhis feet planted in Manchuria and northern Korea, sees\r\nthe British Bulldog seated in southern China, while ``The\r\nSun Elf'' ( Japan), sitting upon its Island Kingdom,\r\nproclaims that ``John Bull and I will watch the Bear.''\r\nThe German Sausage around Kiau-chou makes no sign of life,\r\nbut the French Frog, jumping about in Tonquin and Annam\r\nand branded ``Fashoda and Colonial Expansion,'' tries to\r\nstretch a friendly hand to the Bear over the Bulldog's head.\r\nThen, to offset this proffered assistance to the Bear, the Chinese\r\nartist, with characteristic cunning, brings in the New World\r\npower. He places the American Eagle over the Philippines,\r\nits beak extended towards the Bulldog, and writes upon it the\r\nphrase, ``Blood is thicker than water.''[57]\r\n\r\n\r\n[57] Reproduced in the Newark, N. J., Evening News, January 9, 1904\r\n\r\n\r\nAs far as Americans have any sympathy at all with European\r\nschemes for conquest in China, they naturally look with more\r\nfavour on England and Germany than on France and Russia.\r\nThe reason is apparent. England establishes honest and\r\nbeneficent government wherever she goes and makes its advantages\r\nfreely accessible to the citizens of other nations, so\r\nthat an American is not only as safe but as unrestricted in all\r\nhis legitimate activities as he would be in his own land.\r\nGermany, too, while not so hospitable as England, is nevertheless\r\na Teutonic, Protestant power under whose ascendancy in\r\nShantung our missionaries find ample freedom. But France\r\nand Russia are more narrowly and jealously national in their\r\naims. Their possessions are openly regarded as assets to be\r\nmanaged for their own interests rather than for those of the na-\r\ntives or of the world. The colonial attitude of the former towards\r\nall Protestant missionary work is dictated by the Roman\r\nCatholic Church and is therefore hostile to Protestants, while\r\nthe Russian Greek Church tolerates no other form of religion\r\nthat it can repress. A recent traveller reports that Russia has\r\nput every possible obstruction in the way of reopening the mission\r\nstations that were abandoned during the Boxer outbreak.\r\nShe has already put Manchuria under the Greek archimandrite\r\nof Peking, and has sought to limit all Christian teaching to the\r\nmembers of the Orthodox Greek Church. It is significant that\r\nRussia is strenuously opposing, under a variety of pretexts, the\r\n``open door'' which Secretary Hay obtained from China in\r\nManchuria, while there is ground for suspecting that Russian\r\ninfluence in Constantinople is preventing, or at least delaying\r\nas long as possible, that legal recognition of American rights\r\nin Turkey which the Sultan has already granted to several\r\nother nations. As for Russian ascendancy in Manchuria,\r\neverybody knows that it is inimical to the interests of other\r\ncountries and that there will be little freedom of trade if Russia\r\ncan prevent it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nGROWING IRRITATION OF THE CHINESE--THE\r\nREFORM PARTY\r\n\r\nTHE effect of the operation of these commercial and\r\npolitical forces upon a conservative and exclusive\r\npeople was of course to exasperate to a high degree.\r\nA proud people were wounded in their most sensitive place by\r\nthe ruthless and arrogant way in which foreigners broke down\r\ntheir cherished wall of separation from the rest of the world and\r\ntrampled upon their highly-prized customs and institutions.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that the history of the dealings of the\r\nChristian powers with China is not altogether pleasant reading.\r\nThe provocation was indeed great, but the retaliation was\r\nheavy. And all the time foreign nations refused to grant to the\r\nChinese the privileges which they forced them to grant to others.\r\nWe sometimes imagine that the Golden Rule is peculiar to\r\nChristianity. It is indeed in its highest form, but its spirit\r\nwas recognized by Confucius five centuries before Christ. His\r\nexpression of it was negative, but it gave the Chinese some\r\nidea of the principle. They were not, therefore, pleasantly impressed\r\nwhen they found the alleged Christian nations violating\r\nthat principle. Even Christian America has not been an exception.\r\nWe have Chinese exclusion laws, but we will not\r\nallow China to exclude Americans. We sail our gunboats up\r\nher rivers, but we would not allow China to sail gunboats into\r\nours. If a Chinese commits a crime in America, he is amenable\r\nto American law as interpreted by an American court. But if\r\nan American commits a crime in China, he can be tried only\r\nby his consul; not a Chinese court in the Empire has jurisdiction\r\nover him, and the people naturally infer from this that\r\nwe have no confidence in their sense of justice or in their\r\nadministration of it.\r\n\r\nThis law of extra-territoriality is one of the chief sources of\r\nirritation against foreigners, for it not only implies contempt,\r\nbut it makes foreigners a privileged class. Said Minister Wen\r\nHsiang in 1868:--``Take away your extra-territorial clause,\r\nand merchant and missionary may settle anywhere and everywhere.\r\nBut retain it, and we must do our best to confine you\r\nand our trouble to the treaty ports.'' But unfortunately this\r\nis a cause of resentment that Western nations cannot prudently\r\nremove in the near future. While we can understand the resentment\r\nof the Chinese magistrates as they see their methods\r\ndiscredited by the foreigner, it would not do to subject Europeans\r\nand Americans to Chinese legal procedure. The language\r\nof Mr. Wade, the British Minister, to Minister Wen\r\nHsiang in June, 1, is still applicable:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``Experience has shown that, in many cases, the latter (law of China)\r\nwill condemn a prisoner to death, where the law of England would be\r\nsatisfied by a penalty far less severe, if indeed, it were possible to punish\r\nthe man at all. It is to be deplored that misunderstandings should arise\r\nfrom a difference in our codes; but I see no remedy for this until China\r\nshall see fit to revise the process of investigation now common in her\r\ncourts. So long as evidence is wrung from witnesses by torture, it is\r\nscarcely possible for the authorities of a foreign power to associate\r\nthemselves with those of China in the trial of a criminal case; and unless the\r\nauthorities of both nationalities are present, there will always be a suspicion\r\nof unfairness on one side or the other. This difficulty surmounted,\r\nthere would be none in the way of providing a code of laws to affect\r\nmixed cases; none, certainly, on the part of England; none, in my belief,\r\neither, on the part of any other Power.''[58]\r\n\r\n\r\n[58] Correspondence Respecting the Circular of the Chinese Government\r\nof February 9, 1871, Relating to Missionaries. Presented to both\r\nHouses of Parliament by command of Her Majesty, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime, as the Hon. Frederick F. Low, United States\r\nMinister at Peking, wrote to the State Department at Wash-\r\nington, March 20, 1871:--``The dictates of humanity will\r\nnot permit the renunciation of the right for all foreigners that\r\nthey shall be governed and punished by their own laws.''\r\n\r\nBut the Chinese do not see the question in that light. Their\r\nmethods of legal procedure are sanctioned in their eyes by immemorial\r\ncustom and they fail to understand why forms that,\r\nin their judgment, are good enough for Chinese are not also good\r\nenough for despised foreigners. When we take into consideration\r\nthe further fact that the typical white man, the world\r\nover, acts as if he were a lord of creation, and treats Asiatics\r\nwith more or less condescension as if they were his inferiors, we\r\ncan understand the very natural resentment of the Chinese,\r\nwho have just as much pride of race as we have, and who indeed\r\nconsider themselves the most highly civilized people in\r\nthe world. The fact that foreign nations are able to thrash\r\nthem does not convince them that those nations are superior,\r\nany more than a gentleman's physical defeat by a pugilist would\r\nsatisfy him that the pugilist is a better man. It is not without\r\nsignificance that the white man is generally designated in China\r\nas ``the foreign devil.''\r\n\r\nThe natural resentment of the Chinese in such circumstances\r\nwas intensified by the conduct of the foreign soldiery. Army\r\nlife is not a school of virtue anywhere, particularly in Asia where\r\na comparatively defenseless people open wide opportunities for\r\nevil practices and where Asiatic methods of opposition infuriate\r\nmen. In almost every place where the soldiers of\r\nEurope landed, they pillaged and burned and raped and\r\nslaughtered like incarnate fiends. Chefoo to-day is an illustration\r\nof the effect. It is a city where foreigners have resided\r\nfor forty years, where there are consuls of all nations and\r\nextensive business relations with other ports, where foreign\r\nsteamers regularly touch and where war-ships frequently lie.\r\nThere were five formidable cruisers there during my visit.\r\nSurely the Chinese of Chefoo should understand the situation.\r\nBut during the troubles of 1860, French troops were quartered\r\nthere and their conduct was so atrociously brutal and lustful\r\nthat Chefoo has ever since been bitterly anti-foreign. The\r\nPresbyterian missionaries have repeatedly tried to do Christian\r\nwork in the old walled city, but have never succeeded in gaining\r\na foothold, and all their local missionary work is confined\r\nto the numerous population which has come from other parts of\r\nthe province and settled around Chefoo proper. Nothing but\r\nbattleships in the harbour kept that old city from attacking\r\nforeigners during the Boxer outbreak. Even to-day the cry\r\n``kill, kill'' is sometimes raised as a foreigner walks through\r\nthe streets, and inflammatory placards are often posted on the\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nWith the record of foreign aggressions in China before us,\r\ncan we wonder that the Chinese became restive? The New\r\nYork Sun truly says: ``It was while Chinese territory was\r\nthus virtually being given away that the people became uneasy\r\nand riots were started; the people felt that their land had been\r\ndespoiled.'' The Hon. Chester Holcombe truly remarks:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``Those who desire to know more particularly what the Chinese\r\nthink about it, how they regard the proposed dismemberment of the\r\nEmpire and the extinction of their national life, are referred to the\r\nBoxer movement as furnishing a practical exposition of their views. It\r\ncontained the concentrated wrath and hate of sixty years' slow growth.\r\nAnd it had the hearty sympathy of many, many millions of Chinese, who\r\ntook no active part in it. For, beyond a doubt, it represented to them a\r\npatriotic effort to save their country from foreign aggression and ultimate\r\ndestruction.... The European Powers have only themselves to\r\nthank for the bitter hatred of the Chinese and the crash in which it\r\nculminated. Governmental policies outrageous and beyond excuse,\r\nscandalous diplomacy, and unprovoked attacks upon the rights and\r\npossessions of China, have been at the root of all the trouble.''[59]\r\n\r\n\r\n[59] Article in The Outlook, February 13, 1904,\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd shall we pretend innocent surprise that the irritation of\r\nthe Chinese rapidly grew? Suppose that after the murder of\r\nthe Chinese in Rock Springs, Wyoming, a Chinese fleet\r\nhad been able to seize New York and Boston Harbours, and\r\nsuppose our Government had been weak enough to acquiesce.\r\nWould the American people have made any protest?\r\nWould the lives of Chinese have been safe on our streets? And\r\nwas it an entirely base impulse that led the men of China violently\r\nto oppose the forcible seizure of their country by aliens?\r\nThe Empress Dowager declared in her now famous edict:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``The various Powers cast upon us looks of tiger-like voracity, hustling\r\neach other in their endeavours to be first to seize upon our innermost\r\nterritories. They think that China, having neither money nor troops, would\r\nnever venture to go to war with them. They fail to understand, however,\r\nthat there are certain things which this Empire can never consent to, and\r\nthat, if hard pressed, we have no alternative but to rely upon the justice\r\nof our cause, the knowledge of which in our breasts strengthens our resolves\r\nand steels us to present a united front against our aggressors.''\r\n\r\nThat would probably be called patriotic if it had emanated\r\nfrom the ruler of any other people.\r\n\r\nWhen with Russia in Manchuria, Germany in Shantung,\r\nEngland in the valleys of the Yang-tze and the Pearl, France\r\nin Tonquin and Japan in Formosa, the whole Empire appeared\r\nto be in imminent danger of absorption, the United States again\r\nshowed itself the friend of China by trying to stem the tide.\r\nOur great Secretary of State, John Hay, sent to the European\r\ncapitals that famous note of September, 1899, which none of\r\nthem wanted to answer but which none of them dared to refuse,\r\ninviting them to join the United States in assuring the\r\napprehensive Chinese that the Governments of Europe and\r\nAmerica had no designs upon China's territorial integrity, but\r\nsimply desired an ``open door'' for commerce, and that any\r\nclaims by one nation of ``sphere of influence'' would ``in no\r\nway interfere with any treaty port or any vested interest''\r\nwithin that sphere, but that all nations should continue to enjoy\r\nequality of treatment. In response, the Russian Government,\r\nDecember 30, 1899, through Count Mouravieff, suavely declared:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``The Imperial Government has already demonstrated its firm intention\r\nto follow the policy of the `open door.' . . . As to the ports now\r\nopened or hereafter to be opened to foreign commerce by the Chinese\r\nGovernment, . . . the Imperial Government has no intention whatever\r\nof claiming any privileges for its own subjects to the exclusion of\r\nother foreigners.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other Powers also assented. But it was all in vain.\r\nMatters had already gone too far, and, beside, the Chinese\r\nknew well enough that the Powers were not to be trusted beyond\r\nthe limits of self-interest.\r\n\r\nSome of the Chinese, it is true, had the intelligence to see\r\nthat changes were inevitable, and the result was the development\r\nof a Reform Party among the Chinese themselves. It\r\nwas not large, but it included some influential men, though,\r\nunfortunately, their zeal was not always tempered by discretion.\r\nThe war with Japan powerfully aided them. True, many of\r\nthe Chinese do not yet know that there was such a war, for\r\nnews travels slowly in a land whose railway and telegraph lines,\r\nnewspapers and post-offices are yet few, and whose average\r\ninhabitant has never been twenty miles from the village in which\r\nhe was born. But some who did know realized that Japan had\r\nwon by the aid of Western methods. An eagerness to acquire\r\nthose methods resulted. Missionaries were besieged by Chinese\r\nwho wished to learn English. Modern books were given a\r\nwide circulation. Several of the influential advisers of the\r\nEmperor became students of Occidental science and political\r\neconomy. In five years, 1893-1898, the book sales of one\r\nsociety--that for the Diffusion of Christian and General Knowledge\r\nAmong the Chinese--leaped from $817 to $18,457, while\r\nevery mission press was run to its utmost capacity to supply the\r\nnew demands.\r\n\r\nA powerful exponent of the new ideas appeared in the great\r\nViceroy, Chang Chih-tung. He wrote a book, entitled\r\n``China's Only Hope,'' exposing the causes of China's weakness\r\nand advocating radical reforms. The book was printed\r\nby the Tsung-li Yamen, and by royal command copies were\r\nsent to the high officials of the Empire. Big yellow posters advertised\r\nit from the walls of leading cities, and in a short time\r\na million copies were sold. It is hardly an exaggeration to say\r\nthat ``this book made more history in a shorter time than any\r\nother modern piece of literature, that it astonished a kingdom,\r\nconvulsed an Empire and brought on a war.''\r\n\r\nThe Reform Party urged the young Emperor to use the imperial\r\npower for the advancement of his people. He yielded to\r\nthe pressure and became an eager and diligent student of the\r\nWestern learning and methods. In the opening months of the\r\nyear 1898, he bought no less than 129 foreign books, including\r\na Bible and several scientific works, besides maps, globes, and\r\nwind and current charts. Nor did he stop with this, but with\r\nthe ardour of a new convert issued the now famous reform\r\nedicts, which, if they could have been carried into effect, would\r\nhave revolutionized China and started her on the high road to\r\nnational greatness. These memorable decrees have been summarized\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Establishing a university at Peking.\r\n\r\n2. Sending imperial clansmen to study European and American Governments.\r\n\r\n3. Encouraging art, science and modern agriculture\r\n\r\n4. Expressing the willingness of the Emperor to hear the objections\r\nof the conservatives to progress and reform.\r\n\r\n5. Abolishing the literary essay as a prominent part of the Government\r\nexaminations\r\n\r\n6. Censuring those who attempted to delay the establishment of the\r\nPeking Imperial University.\r\n\r\n7. Directing that the construction of the Lu Han railway be carried\r\non with more vigour.\r\n\r\n8. Advising the adoption of Western arms and drill for all the Tartar\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\n9. Ordering the establishment of agricultural schools in the provinces\r\nto teach improved methods of agriculture.\r\n\r\n10. Ordering the introduction of patent and copyright laws.\r\n\r\n11. Ordering the Board of War and the Foreign Office to report on\r\nthe reform of the military examinations.\r\n\r\n12. Offering special rewards to inventors and authors.\r\n\r\n13. Ordering officials to encourage trade and assist merchants.\r\n\r\n14. Ordering the foundation of school boards in every city in the\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\n15. Establishing a Bureau of Mines and Railroads.\r\n\r\n16. Encouraging journalists to write on all political subjects.\r\n\r\n17. Establishing naval academies and training ships.\r\n\r\n18. Summoning the ministers and provincial authorities to assist the\r\nEmperor in his work of reform.\r\n\r\n19. Directing that schools be founded in connection with all the Chinese\r\nlegations in foreign countries for the benefit of the children of Chinese\r\nin those countries.\r\n\r\n20. Establishing commercial bureaus in Shanghai for the encouragement\r\nof trade.\r\n\r\n21. Abolishing six useless Boards in Peking.\r\n\r\n22. Granting the right to memorialize the Throne by sealed memorials.\r\n\r\n23. Dismissing two presidents and four vice-presidents of the Board\r\nof Rites for disobeying the Emperor's orders that memorials should be\r\npresented to him unopened.\r\n\r\n24. Abolishing the governorships of Hupeh, Kwang-tung and Yun-nan\r\nas a useless expense to the country.\r\n\r\n25. Establishing schools for instruction in the preparation of tea and\r\nsilk.\r\n\r\n20, Abolishing the slow courier posts in favour of the Imperial\r\nCustoms' Post.\r\n\r\n27 Approving a system of budgets as in Western countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, alas, it is disastrous to try to ``hustle the East.'' The\r\nChinese are phlegmatic and will endure much, but this was a\r\nlittle too much. Myriads of scholars and officials, who saw\r\ntheir hopes and positions jeopardized by the new tests, protested\r\nwith all the virulence of the silversmiths of Ephesus, and\r\nall the conservatism of China rallied to their support.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the Yellow River, aptly named ``China's Sorrow,''\r\nagain overflowed its banks, devastating a region 100\r\nmiles long and varying from twenty-five to fifty miles wide.\r\nThree hundred villages were swept away and 1,000,000 people\r\nmade homeless. Famine and pestilence speedily followed, so\r\nthat the whole catastrophe assumed appalling proportions.\r\nEven American communities are apt to become reckless and\r\nriotous in time of calamity, and in China this tendency of human\r\nnature was intensified by a superstition which led the people\r\nto believe that the disaster was due to the baleful influence\r\nof the foreigners, or that it was a punishment for their failure\r\nto resist them, while in the farther north a drought led to\r\nequally superstitious fury against ``the foreign devils.''\r\n\r\nThe virile and resolute Empress-Dowager headed the reaction\r\nagainst the headlong progressiveness of the young\r\nEmperor. September 22, 1898, the world was startled by an\r\nImperial Decree which read in part as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``Her Imperial Majesty the Empress-Dowager, Tze Hsi, since the first\r\nyears of the reign of the late Emperor Tung Chih down to our present\r\nreign, has twice ably filled the regency of the Empire, and never did her\r\nMajesty fail in happily bringing to a successful issue even the most difficult\r\nproblems of government. In all things we have ever placed the\r\ninterests of our Empire before those of others, and, looking back at her\r\nMajesty's successful handiwork, we are now led to beseech, for a third\r\ntime, for this assistance from her Imperial majesty, so that we may benefit\r\nfrom her wise and kindly advice in all matters of State. Having now\r\nobtained her Majesty's gracious consent, we truly consider this to be a great\r\nboon both to ourselves as well as to the people of our Empire. Hence we\r\nnow command that from henceforth, commencing with this morning, the\r\naffairs of state shall be transacted in the ordinary Throne Hall, and that\r\nto-morrow (23rd) we shall, at the head of the Princes and Nobles and\r\nMinisters of our Court, attend in full dress in the Ching-cheng Throne\r\nHall, to pay ceremonial obeisance to her Imperial Majesty the Empress-\r\nDowager. Let the Board of Rites draw up for our perusal the ceremonies\r\nto be observed on the above occasion.''[60]\r\n\r\n\r\n[60] Pott, ``The Outbreak in China,'' pp. 56, 57.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe youthful son of Toanwong was appointed heir to the\r\nthrone and the ambitious father immediately proceeded to use\r\nhis enhanced prestige to set the Empire in a blaze.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nTHE BOXER UPRISING\r\n\r\nTHE now famous Boxers were members of two of the\r\nsecret societies which have long flourished in China.\r\nTo the Chinese they are known as League of United\r\nPatriots, Great Sword Society, Righteous Harmony Fists'\r\nAssociation and kindred names. Originally, they were hostile\r\nto the foreign Manchu dynasty. When Germany made the\r\nmurder of two Roman Catholic missionaries a pretext for pushing\r\nher political ambitions, the Boxers naturally arrayed themselves\r\nagainst them. As the champions of the national spirit\r\nagainst the foreigners, the membership rapidly increased.\r\nSupernatural power was claimed. Temples were converted into\r\nmeeting-places, and soon excited men were drilling in every\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nThe real ruler of China at this time, as all the world knows,\r\nwas the Empress Dowager, who has been characterized as\r\n``the only man in China.'' At any rate, she is a woman of\r\nextraordinary force of character. She was astute enough to\r\nencourage the Boxers, and thus turn one of the most troublesome\r\nfoes of the Manchu throne against the common enemy,\r\nthe foreigner. Under her influence, the depredations of the\r\nBoxers, which were at first confined to the Shantung Province,\r\nspread with the swiftness of a prairie fire, until in the spring of\r\n1900 the most important provinces of the Empire were ablaze\r\nand the legations in Peking were closely besieged. In the\r\nheat of the conflict and under the agonizing strain of anxiety\r\nfor imperilled loved ones, many hard things were said and\r\nwritten about the officials who allied themselves with the\r\nBoxers. But Sir Robert Hart, who personally knew them and\r\nwho suffered as much as any one from their fury, candidly\r\nwrote after the siege: ``These men were eminent in their own\r\ncountry for their learning and services, were animated by\r\npatriotism, were enraged by foreign dictation, and had the\r\ncourage of their convictions. We must do them the justice of\r\nallowing that they were actuated by high motives and love of\r\ncountry,'' though he adds, ``that does not always or necessarily\r\nmean political ability or highest wisdom.''\r\n\r\nAnd so the irrepressible conflict broke out. It had to come,\r\na conflict between conservatism and progress, between race\r\nprejudice and brotherhood, between superstition and Christianity,\r\nthe tremendous conflict of ages which every nation has\r\nhad to fight, and which in China was not different in kind,\r\nbut only on a more colossal scale because there it involved\r\nhalf the human race at once. Of course it was impossible\r\nfor so vast a nation permanently to segregate itself. The river\r\nof progress cannot be permanently stayed. It will gather force\r\nbehind an obstacle until it is able to sweep it away. The\r\nBoxer uprising was the breaking up of this fossilized conservatism.\r\nIt was such a tumultuous upheaval as the crusades\r\ncaused in breaking up the stagnation of mediaeval Europe. As\r\nFrance opposed the new ideas, which in England were quietly\r\naccepted, only to have them surge over her in the frightful\r\nflood of the revolution, so China entered with the violence always\r\ninseparable from resistance the transition which Japan\r\nwelcomed with a more open mind.\r\n\r\nThough missionaries were not the real cause of the Boxer\r\nuprising, its horrors fell most heavily upon them. This was\r\npartly because many of them were living at exposed points in\r\nthe interior while most other foreigners were assembled in the\r\ntreaty ports where they were better protected; partly because\r\nthe movement developed such hysterical frenzy that it attacked\r\nwith blind, unreasoning fury every available foreigner, and\r\npartly because in most places the actual killing and pillaging\r\nwere not done by the people who best knew the missionaries\r\nbut by mobs from the slums, ruffians from other villages, or,\r\nas in Paoting-fu and Shan-si, in obedience to the direct orders\r\nof bigoted officials.\r\n\r\nAnd so it came to pass that the innocent suffered more than\r\nthe guilty. Dr. A. H. Smith[61] concluded after careful inquiry\r\nthat ``the devastating Boxer cyclone cost the lives of 135 adult\r\nProtestant missionaries and fifty-three children and of thirty-\r\nfive Roman Catholic Fathers and nine Sisters. The Protestants\r\nwere in connection with ten different missions, one being\r\nunconnected. They were murdered in four provinces and in\r\nMongolia, and belonged to Great Britain, the United States and\r\nSweden. No such outbreak against Christianity has been\r\nseen in modern times. The destruction of property was on\r\nthe same continental scale. Generally speaking, all mission\r\nstations north of the Yellow River, with all their dwelling-houses,\r\nchapels, hospitals, dispensaries, schools, and buildings of every\r\ndescription were totally destroyed, though there were occasional\r\nexceptions, of which the village where these pages are written\r\nwas one. The central and southern portions of the Empire\r\nwere only partially affected by the anti-foreign madness, not\r\nbecause they were under different conditions, but mainly\r\nthrough the strong repressive measures of four men, Liu Kun\r\nYi and Chang Chih-tung, Governors-General of the four great\r\nprovinces in the Yang-tse Valley; Yuan Shih Kai in Shantung,\r\nand a Manchu, Tuan Fang, in Shen-si. The jurisdiction of\r\nthis quartette made an impassable barrier across which the\r\nmovement was unable to project itself in force, but much mischief\r\nin an isolated way was wrought in nearly every part of\r\nChina not rigorously controlled.''\r\n\r\n\r\n[61] ``Rex Christus,'' p. 210.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo many volumes have been written about the Boxer Uprising\r\nthat it is not necessary to double the size of this book in\r\norder to recount the details. For the full narrative, the reader\r\nis referred to the books mentioned below.[62] But I cannot for-\r\nbear some description of the scenes of massacre that I personally\r\nvisited. I was unable to go to the remoter province of\r\nShan-si where so many devoted men and women laid down\r\ntheir lives and where many who escaped death endured indescribable\r\nhardships. But in the province of Shantung, where\r\nthe Boxer Uprising originated, I was witness to the ruin that\r\nwas wrought in many places, though the iron hand of the\r\ngreat Governor, Yuan Shih Kai, prevented much bloodshed.\r\nThen I turned to the northern province of Chih-li where official\r\nhands, instead of restraining, actually guided and goaded the\r\nmaddened rioters.\r\n\r\n\r\n[62] ``China in Convulsion,'' Arthur H.

Smith and others.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a delightful voyage of eighteen hours from Chefoo\r\nover a smooth sea, we anchored outside the bar, nine miles\r\nfrom shore, the tide not permitting our steamer to cross with\r\nits heavy load. A tug took us off and entering the Pei-ho\r\nRiver, we passed the famous Taku forts to the railway wharf at\r\nTong-ku. It was significant to find foreign flags flying over the\r\nTaku forts and also over the mud-walled villages near by.\r\nScores of merchant steamers, transports and war vessels were\r\nlying off Taku as well as hundreds of junks. The river was\r\nfull of smaller craft among which were several Japanese and\r\nAmerican gunboats. The railroad station presented a motley\r\nappearance. A regiment of Japanese had just arrived and\r\nwhile we were waiting, three train-loads of British Sikhs and\r\nseveral cars of Austrian marines and British ``Tommy Atkins''\r\ncame in. The platform was thronged with officers and soldiers\r\nof various nationalities, including a few Russians.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more dreary than the mud flats that the\r\ntraveller to the imperial city first sees. The greater part of the\r\nway from Taku to Peking, the soil is poor and little cultivated.\r\nBut as we advanced, kao-liang fields were more frequent,\r\nthough the growth was far behind that in Shantung at the same\r\nseason. Small trees were numerous during the latter half of\r\nthe trip. The soil being too thin for good crops, the people\r\ngrow more fuel and fruit.\r\n\r\nEvidences of the great catastrophe were seen long before\r\nreaching the capital. Burned villages and battered buildings\r\nlined the route. At Tien-tsin several of the foreign buildings\r\nhad shell holes. One corrugated iron building near the railway\r\nstation was pierced like a sieve and thousands of native\r\nhouses were in ruins. The city wall had been razed to the\r\nground and a highway made where it had stood--an unspeakable\r\nhumiliation to the proud commercial metropolis. The Japanese\r\nsoldiers teased the citizens by telling them that ``a city\r\nwithout a wall is like a woman without clothes,'' and the\r\npeople keenly felt the shame implied in the taunt.\r\n\r\nIn Peking, the very fact that the railroad train on which we\r\ntravelled rushed noisily through a ragged chasm in the wall of\r\nthe Chinese city, and stopped at the entrance of the Temple of\r\nHeaven, was suggestive of the consequences of war. The\r\ncity, as a whole, was not as badly injured as I had expected to\r\nfind it, but the ravages of war were evident enough. Wrecked\r\nshops, crumbled houses, shot-torn walls were on every side,\r\nwhile the most sacred places to a Chinese and a Manchu had\r\nbeen profaned. At other times the Purple Forbidden City,\r\nthe Winter and Summer Palaces, the Temple of Heaven and\r\nkindred imperial enclosures are inaccessible to the foreigner.\r\nBut a pass from the military authorities opened to us every door.\r\nWe walked freely through the extensive grounds and into all\r\nthe famous buildings--including the throne rooms which the\r\nhighest Chinese official can approach only upon his knees and\r\nwith his face abjectly on the stone pavement--and the private\r\napartments of the Emperor and the Empress Dowager. I was\r\nimpressed by the vastness of the Palace buildings and grounds,\r\nthe carvings of stone and wood, and the number of articles of\r\nforeign manufacture. But thousands of Americans in moderate\r\ncircumstances have more spacious and comfortable bedrooms\r\nthan those of the Emperor and Empress Dowager of\r\nChina. All the living apartments looked cheerless. The\r\nfloors were of artificial stone or brick in squares of about\r\n20 x 20 inches and of course everything was covered with dust.\r\nThe far-famed Temple of Heaven is the most artistic building\r\nin China, a dream of beauty, colour and grace. For a generation\r\nbefore the siege of Peking, no foreigner except General\r\nGrant had entered that sacred enclosure, and the Chinese raised\r\na furore because Li Hung Chang admitted even the distinguished\r\nAmerican. As I freely walked about the place, photographed\r\nthe Temple and stood on the circular altar that is supposed to\r\nbe the centre of the earth and where the Emperor worships\r\nalone at the winter solstice, British Sikhs lounged under the\r\ntrees, army mules munched the luxuriant grass and quartermasters'\r\nwagons stood in long rows near the sacred spot\r\nwhere a Chinese would prostrate himself in reverence and fear.\r\n\r\nWe rode past innumerable ruined buildings and through\r\nmotley throngs of Manchus, Chinese, German, French, Italian,\r\nBritish and Japanese soldiers to the Presbyterian compound at\r\nDuck Lane, which, though narrow, is not so unimportant a\r\nstreet as its name implies. But where devoted missionaries\r\nhad so long lived and toiled, we saw only shapeless heaps of\r\nbroken bricks and a few tottering fragments of walls. At the\r\nSecond Street compound there was even greater ruin, if that\r\nwere possible. Silently we stood beside the great hole which\r\nhad once been the hospital cistern and from which the Japanese\r\nsoldiers, after the siege, had taken the bodies of a hundred\r\nmurdered Chinese. Not all had been Christians, for in that\r\ncarnival of blood, many who were merely suspected of being\r\nfriendly to foreigners were killed, while foes took advantage of\r\nthe tumult to pay off old scores of hate.\r\n\r\nThe first reports that had come to New York were that four-\r\nfifths of the Chinese Christians and three-fourths of the boys and\r\ngirls in the boarding-schools had been killed or had died under\r\nthe awful hardships of that fatal summer. But as the months\r\npassed, first one and then another and another were found.\r\nHusbands searched for wives, parents for children, brothers\r\nfor sisters, until a considerable number of the missing ones had\r\nbeen found, though the number of the lost was still great.\r\n\r\nAbout two hundred of these surviving Christians and their\r\nfamilies were living together in native buildings adjoining the\r\nresidence in which we were entertained. Their history was\r\none of agony and bereavement. Including those who fell at\r\nPaoting-fu, 191 of their fellow Christians had received the\r\ncrown of martyrdom, so that almost every survivor had lost\r\nfather or mother, brother or sister or friend. The Chinese are\r\nsupposed to be a phlegmatic people and not given to emotion.\r\nBut never have I met a congregation more swiftly responsive\r\nthan this one in Peking as I bore to them kindly messages from\r\nmany friends in other lands.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic Cathedral was immortalized by Bishop\r\nFavier's defense during the memorable siege. The mission\r\nbuildings occupy a spacious and strongly-walled compound in\r\nthe Manchu city. Hundreds of bullet and shell holes in the roofs\r\nand walls were suggestive evidences of the fury of the Boxer\r\nattack, while great pits marked the spots where mines had\r\nbeen exploded.\r\n\r\nI called on the famous Bishop. He was, for he has since\r\ndied, a burly, heavily-bearded Frenchman of about sixty-five\r\napparently. He received us most cordially and readily talked\r\nof the siege. He said that of the eighty Europeans and 3,400\r\nChristians with him in the siege, 2,700 were women and children.\r\nFour hundred were buried, of whom forty were killed\r\nby bullets, twenty-five by one explosion, eighty-one by another\r\nand one by another. Of the rest, some died of disease but the\r\ngreater part of starvation. Twenty-one children were buried\r\nat one time in one grave. Beside these 400 who were killed\r\nor who died, many more were blown to pieces in explosions so\r\nthat nothing could be found to bury. Fifty-one children disappeared\r\nin this way and not a fragment remained.\r\n\r\nThe first month of the siege, the food allowance was half a\r\npound a day. The first half of the second month, it was reduced\r\nto four ounces, but for the second half only two ounces\r\ncould be served and the people had to eat roots, bark and the\r\nleaves of trees and shrubs. Eighteen mules were eaten during\r\nthe siege. The Bishop said that in the diocese outside of\r\nPeking, 6,000 Chinese Catholics, including three native priests,\r\nwere killed by the Boxers. Only four European priests were\r\nkilled, one in Peking and three outside. ``Not one foreign\r\npriest left the diocese during the troubles,'' a statement that is\r\nequally true of the Presbyterian missionaries and, so far as I\r\nknow, of those of other churches.\r\n\r\nClouds lowered as we left Peking, July 6th, on the Peking and\r\nHankow Railway for Paoting-fu, that city of sacred and painful\r\ninterest to every American Christian. Soon rain began to\r\nfall, and it steadily continued while we rode over the vast level\r\nplain, through unending fields of kao-liang, interspersed with\r\nplots of beans, peanuts, melons and cucumbers, and mud and\r\nbrick-walled villages whose squalid wretchedness was hidden\r\nby the abundant foliage of the trees, which are the only beauty\r\nof Chinese cities. At almost every railway station, roofless\r\nbuildings, crumbling walls and broken water tanks bore painful\r\nwitness to the rage of the Boxers. At Liang-hsiang-hsien the\r\nfirst foreign property was destroyed, and all along the line\r\noutrages were perpetrated on the inoffensive native Christians.\r\nNowhere else in China was the hatred of the foreigner more\r\nviolent, for here hereditary pride and bigoted conservatism,\r\nunusually intense even for China, were reinforced by Boxer\r\nchiefs from the neighbouring province of Shantung, and were\r\nparticularly irritated by the aggressiveness of Roman Catholic\r\npriests and by the construction of the railroad. It is only 110\r\nmiles from Peking to Paoting-fu. But the schedule was slow\r\nand the stops long, so that we were six hours in making the\r\njourney. Arriving at the large, well-built brick station, we\r\nbumped and splashed in a Chinese cart through narrow, muddy\r\nstreets to the residence of a wealthy Chinese family that had\r\ndeemed a hasty departure expedient when the French and\r\nBritish forces entered the city, and whose house had been\r\nassigned by the magistrate as temporary quarters for the Presbyterian\r\nmissionaries.\r\n\r\nProtestant mission work at Paoting-fu was begun only about\r\nthirty years ago by the American Board. The station was\r\nnever a large one, the total nominal force of missionaries up\r\nto the Boxer outbreak being two ordained married men, Ewing\r\nand Pitkin, one physician, Dr. Noble, and two single women,\r\nthe Misses Morrill and Gould. In the whole station field\r\nincluding the out-stations, there were not more than 300 Christians\r\nand those were south of a line drawn through the centre\r\nof the city of Paoting-fu. There were two boarding-schools,\r\none for boys and one for girls, both small, and a general\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\nThe China Inland Mission had no mission work at Paoting-fu,\r\nbut as the city is at the head of navigation of the Paoting-fu\r\nRiver from Tien-tsin and was also at that time the terminus of\r\nthe Peking and Hankow Railway, the Mission made it a point\r\nof trans-shipment and of formation of cart and shendza trains\r\nfor its extensive work in the Shan-si and Shen-si provinces, and\r\nkept a forwarding agent there, Mr. Benjamin Bagnall.\r\n\r\nThe Presbyterian station was not opened till 1893, and the\r\nforce at the time of the outbreak consisted of three ordained\r\nmen, the Revs. J. Walter Lowrie, J. A. Miller, and F. E.\r\nSimcox, two medical men, George Yardley Taylor and C. V. R.\r\nHodge, and one single woman, Dr. Maud A. Mackay. All\r\nof the men except Lowrie and Taylor were married, and the\r\nformer had his mother, Mrs. Amelia P. Lowrie, with him.\r\nWith the exception of a dispensary and street chapel in rented\r\nquarters in the city, the station plant was at the compound\r\nwhere, on a level tract 660 feet in length by 210 feet in width,\r\nthere were four residences and a hospital and chapel combined,\r\nwith, of course, the usual smaller outbuildings. The only\r\neducational work, beside one out-station day-school, was a small\r\nboarding-school for girls recently started and occupying a little\r\nbuilding originally intended for a stable.\r\n\r\nThis was the situation up to the fateful month of June, 1900.\r\nRumours of impending trouble were numerous, but missionaries\r\nin China become accustomed to threatening placards and\r\nslanderous reports. Though it was evident that the opposition\r\nwas becoming more bitter, the missionaries did not feel that\r\nthey would be justified in abandoning their work. Several,\r\nhowever, were temporarily absent for other reasons. Of the\r\nCongregational missionaries, Dr. and Mrs. Noble and Mrs.\r\nPitkin were on furlough in America and Mr. and Mrs. Ewing\r\nwere spending a few weeks at the seaside resort, Pei-tai-ho,\r\nso that Mr. Pitkin, Miss Morrill and Miss Gould were the only\r\nones left at the station. Of the Presbyterian missionaries\r\nMr. and Mrs. Miller were also at Pei-tai-ho, Mrs. Lowrie had\r\nsailed for America the 26th of May, and Mr. Lowrie, who had\r\naccompanied her to Shanghai, was at Tien-tsin on his way\r\nback to Paoting-fu. The missionaries remaining at the station\r\nwere thus five,--Dr. Taylor, Mr. and Mrs. Simcox and their\r\nthree children, and Dr. and Mrs. Hodge. The China Inland\r\nforwarding agent, Mr. Bagnall, with his wife and little girl,\r\nwas in his house south of the city wall near the American Board\r\ncompound, and with him was the Rev. William Cooper, who\r\nwas on his way to Shanghai after a visit to the Shan-si Mission\r\nand whose family was then at Chefoo.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to ascertain all the details of the massacre.\r\nNone of the foreigners live to tell the painful story. No other\r\nforeigners reached Paoting-fu until the arrival of the military\r\nexpedition in October, three and a half months later. The\r\nChinese who had participated in the massacre were then in\r\nhiding. Spectators were afraid to talk lest they, too, might be\r\nheld guilty. Most of the Chinese Christians who had been\r\nwith the missionaries were killed, while others were so panic-\r\nstricken that they could remember only the particular scenes\r\nwith which they were directly connected. Moreover, in those\r\nthree and a half months such battles and national commotions\r\nhad occurred, including the capture of Peking and the flight of\r\nthe Emperor, that the people of Paoting-fu had half forgotten\r\nthe murder of a few missionaries in June.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances, full information will probably never\r\nbe obtained, though additional facts may yet turn up from\r\ntime to time. But from all that can be learned, and from the\r\npiecing together of the scattered fragments of information carefully\r\ncollected by Mr. Lowrie, who accompanied the expedition,\r\nit appears that Thursday, June 28th, several Chinese young men\r\nwho had been studying medicine under Dr. Taylor came to\r\nhim at the city dispensary, warned him of the impending\r\ndanger and urged him to leave. When he refused they besought\r\nhim to yield, and though several of them were not\r\nChristians, so strong was their attachment to their teacher that\r\nthey shed tears.\r\n\r\nDr. Taylor placed the dispensary and its contents, together\r\nwith the adjacent street chapel, in charge of the district magistrate\r\nand returned to the mission compound outside the city.\r\nThat very afternoon startling proof was given that foreboding\r\nwas not ill-founded, for the Rev. Meng Chi Hsien, the native\r\npastor of the Congregational Church, was seized while in the\r\ncity, his hands cut off, and the next morning he was beheaded.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries then decided to leave, drew their silver\r\nfrom the local bank and hired carts. But an official assured\r\nthem that there would be no further trouble, and they concluded\r\nto remain. It is doubtful whether they could have escaped\r\nanyway, for the very next afternoon, Saturday, June 30th,\r\na mob left the west gate of the city, and marching northward\r\nparallel to the railroad, turned eastward through a small village\r\nnear the mission compound, which has always been the resort\r\nof bad characters, and attacked the mission between five and\r\nsix o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe first report that all the missionaries were together in the\r\nhouse of Mr. Simcox is now believed to have been erroneous.\r\nThe Hodges were there, but Dr. Taylor was in his own room\r\nin the second story of Mr. Lowrie's house. Seizing a magazine\r\nrifle belonging to Mr. Lowrie, he showed it to the mob and\r\nwarned them not to come nearer. But the Boxers pressed furiously\r\non, in the superstitious belief that the foreigner's bullet\r\ncould not harm them. Then, being alone, and with the traditions\r\nof a Quaker ancestry strong within him, he chose rather\r\nto die himself than to inflict death upon the people he had\r\ncome to save. The Boxers set fire to the house, and the beloved\r\nphysician, throwing the rifle to the floor, disappeared amid\r\nthe flame and smoke. But the body was not consumed, for a\r\nChinese living in a neighbouring village said afterwards that\r\nhe saw it lying in the ruins of the house several days\r\nlater, and that he gave it decent burial in a field near by. But\r\nthere are hundreds of unmarked mounds in that region, and\r\nwhen the foreign expedition arrived in October, he was unable\r\nto indicate the particular one which he had made for Dr. Taylor's\r\nremains. Mr. Lowrie made diligent search and opened a\r\nnumber of graves, but found nothing that could be identified.\r\n\r\nIn the Simcox house, however, the two men were charged\r\nwith the defense of women and children, and to protect them if\r\npossible from unspeakable outrage, when they realized that persuasion\r\nwas vain, they felt justified as a last desperate resort\r\nin using force. The testimony of natives is to the effect\r\nthat at least two Boxers were killed in the attack, one of them\r\nthe Boxer chief, Chu Tu Tze, who that very day had received\r\nthe rank of the gilt button from the Provincial Judge as a recognition\r\nof his anti-foreign zeal and an encouragement to continue\r\nit. He was shot through the head while vociferously\r\nurging the assault from the top of a large grave mound near\r\nthe compound wall.\r\n\r\nThe story that little Paul and Francis Simcox, frightened\r\nby the heat and smoke, ran out of the house and were despatched\r\nby the crowd and their bodies thrown into a well\r\nnow appears to be unfounded. All died together, Mr. and\r\nMrs. Simcox and their three children, and Dr. and Mrs.\r\nHodge; Mr. Simcox being last seen walking up and down\r\nholding the hand of one of his children.\r\n\r\nIt is at least some comfort that they were spared the outrages\r\nand mutilations inflicted on so many of the martyrs of\r\nthat awful summer, for unless some were struck by bullets,\r\ndeath came by suffocation in burning houses--swiftly and\r\nmercifully. No Boxer hand touched them, living or dead, but\r\nwithin less than an hour from the beginning of the attack, the\r\nend came, and the flames did their work so completely that,\r\nsave in the case of Dr. Taylor, nothing remained upon which\r\nfiendish hate could wreak itself. Husbands and wives died as\r\nthey could have wished to die--together, and at the post of\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the Boxers, jubilant over their success of\r\nthe night before, trooped out to the American Board compound\r\nin the south suburb. The two ladies took refuge in the chapel,\r\nwhile Mr. Pitkin remained outside to do what he could to keep\r\nback the mob. But he was speedily shot and then decapitated.\r\nHis body, together with the bodies of several of the members\r\nof the Meng family, was thrown into a hastily-dug pit just outside\r\nthe wall of the compound, but his head was borne in\r\ntriumph to the Provincial Judge, who was the prime mover in\r\nthe outbreak. He caused it to be fixed on the inside of the\r\ncity wall, not far from the southeast corner and nearly opposite\r\nthe temple in which the remaining missionaries were imprisoned.\r\nThere, the Chinese say, it remained for two or\r\nthree weeks, a ghastly evidence of the callous cruelty of a\r\npeople many of whom must have known Mr. Pitkin and the\r\ngood work done at the mission compound not far distant.\r\nWhen sorrowing friends arrived in October, the head could\r\nnot be found, but it has since been recovered and buried with\r\nthe bodies of the other martyrs.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the young women, Miss Morrill and Miss Gould,\r\nthus deprived of their only protector, was not long deferred.\r\nAfter the fall of Mr. Pitkin, they were seized, stripped of all\r\ntheir clothing except one upper and one lower garment, and\r\nled by the howling crowd along a path leading diagonally from\r\nthe entrance of the compound to the road just east of it. Miss\r\nGould did not die of fright as she was taken from the chapel, as\r\nwas at first reported, but at the point where the path enters the\r\nroad, a few hundred yards from the chapel, she fainted. Her\r\nankles were then tied together, and another cord lashed her\r\nwrists in front of her body. A pole was thrust between legs and\r\narms, and she was carried the rest of the way, while Miss Morrill\r\nwalked, characteristically giving to a beggar the little money at\r\nher waist, talking to the people, and with extraordinary self-\r\npossession endeavouring to convince her persecutors of their folly.\r\nAnd so the procession of bloodthirsty men, exulting in the\r\npossession of two defenseless women one of them unconscious,\r\nwended its way northward to the river bank, westward to the\r\nstone bridge, over it and to a temple within the city, not far\r\nfrom the southeast corner of the wall.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Mr. Cooper, Mr. and Mrs. Bagnall and their little\r\ndaughter had begun the day in Mr. Bagnall's house, which\r\nwas a short distance east of the American Board compound,\r\nand on the same road. Seeing the flames of the hospital,\r\nwhich was the first building fired by the Boxers, they fled eastward\r\nalong the road to a Chinese military camp, about a\r\nquarter of a mile distant, whose commanding officer had been\r\non friendly terms with Mr. Bagnall. But in the hour of need\r\nhe arrested them, ruthlessly despoiled them of their valuables,\r\nand sent them under a guard to the arch conspirator, the Provincial\r\nJudge. It is pitiful to hear of the innocent child cling-\r\ning in terror to her mother's dress. But there was no pity in\r\nthe heart of the brutal judge, and the little party was sent to\r\nthe temple where the Misses Morrill and Gould were already\r\nimprisoned.\r\n\r\nAll this was in the morning. A pretended trial was held,\r\nand about four in the afternoon of the same day, all were\r\ntaken to a spot outside the southeast corner of the city wall,\r\nand there, before the graves of two Boxers, they were beheaded\r\nand their bodies thrown into a pit.\r\n\r\nMonths passed before any effort was made by the foreign\r\narmies in Peking to reach Paoting-fu. Shortly after the occupation\r\nof the capital, I wrote to the Secretary of State in Washington\r\nreminding him again of the American citizens who at\r\nlast accounts were at Paoting-fu, and urging that the United\r\nStates commander in Peking be instructed to send an expedition\r\nthere, not to punish for I did not deem it my duty to discuss\r\nthat phase of the question, but to ascertain whether any\r\nAmericans were yet living and to make an investigation as to\r\nwhat had happened.\r\n\r\nSecretary Hay promptly cabled Minister Conger, who soon\r\nwired back that all the Americans at Paoting-fu had been\r\nkilled. The United States forces took no part in the punitive\r\nexpeditions sent out by the European commanders, partly, no\r\ndoubt, because our Government preferred to act on the theory\r\nthat it would be wiser to give the Chinese Government an opportunity\r\nto punish the guilty, and partly because the Administration\r\ndid not desire the United States to be identified with\r\nthe expeditions which were reputed to equal the Boxers in the\r\nmerciless barbarity of burning, pillaging, ravishing and\r\nkilling.\r\n\r\nStill, it is not pleasing to reflect that though there was an\r\nample American force in Peking only 110 miles away, we\r\nwere indebted to a British general for the opportunity to acquire\r\nany accurate information as to the fate of eleven Americans.\r\nAn expedition of inquiry, at least, might have been sent. But\r\nas it was, it was not till October that three columns of Europeans\r\n(still no Americans) left for Paoting-fu. One column was\r\nFrench, under General Baillard. The second was British and\r\nGerman under Generals Campbell and Von Ketteler, both of\r\nthese columns starting from Tien-tsin. The third column left\r\nPeking and was composed of British and Italians led by General\r\nGaselee. The plan was for the three columns to unite as\r\nthey approached the city. But General Baillard made forced\r\nmarches and reached Paoting-fu October 15th, so that when\r\nGeneral Gaselee arrived on the 17th, he found, to his surprise\r\nand chagrin, that the French had already taken bloodless possession\r\nof the city. The British and German columns from\r\nTien-tsin did not arrive till the 20th and 21st. With them\r\ncame the Rev. J. Walter Lowrie, who had obtained permission\r\nto accompany it as an interpreter for the British.\r\n\r\nThe allied Generals immediately made stern inquisitions into\r\nthe outrages that had been committed, which, of course, included\r\nthose upon Roman Catholics as well as upon Protestants.\r\nMr. Lowrie, as the only man who could speak Chinese,\r\nand the only one, too, who personally knew the Chinese, at\r\nonce came into prominence. To the people, he appeared to\r\nhave the power of life and death. All examinations had to be\r\nconducted through him. All accusations and evidence had to\r\nbe sifted by him. The guilty tried to shift the blame upon the\r\ninnocent, and enemies sought to pay off old scores of hatred\r\nupon their foes by charging them with complicity in the massacres.\r\nIt would have accorded with Chinese custom if Mr.\r\nLowrie had availed himself to the utmost of his opportunity to\r\npunish the antagonists of the missionaries, especially as his\r\ndearest friends had been remorselessly murdered and all of his\r\npersonal property destroyed. It was not in human nature to\r\nbe lenient in such circumstances, and the Chinese fully expected\r\nawful vengeance.\r\n\r\nGreat was their amazement when they saw the man whom\r\nthey had so grievously wronged acting not only with modera-\r\ntion and strict justice, but in a kind and forgiving spirit.\r\nEvery scrap of testimony was carefully analyzed in order that\r\nno innocent man might suffer. Instead of securing the execution\r\nof hundreds of smaller officials and common people, as is\r\ncustomary in China in such circumstances, Mr. Lowrie counselled\r\nthe Generals to try Ting Jung, who at the time of the\r\nmassacre was Provincial Judge but who had since been promoted\r\nto the post of Provincial Treasurer and acting Viceroy;\r\nKwei Heng the commander of the Manchu garrison, and Weng\r\nChan Kwei the colonel in command of the Chinese Imperial\r\nforces who had seized the escaping Bagnall party and sent them\r\nback to their doom. The evidence plainly showed that these\r\nhigh officials were the direct and responsible instigators of the\r\nuprising, that they had ordered every movement, and that the\r\ncrowd of smaller officials, Boxers and common people had simply\r\nobeyed their orders. The three dignitaries were found\r\nguilty and condemned to death.\r\n\r\nWas ever retributive justice more signally illustrated than in\r\nthe place in which they were imprisoned pending Count von\r\nWaldersee's approval of the sentence? The military authorities\r\nselected the place, not with reference to its former uses, of\r\nwhich indeed they were ignorant, but simply because it was\r\nconvenient, empty and clean. But it was the Presbyterian\r\nchapel and dispensary in which Mr. Lowrie had so often\r\npreached the gospel of peace and good will and the martyred\r\nDr. Taylor had so often healed the sick in the name of Christ.\r\n\r\nNot long afterwards, the three officials were led to a level,\r\nopen space, just east of a little clump of trees not far from the\r\nsouthwest corner of the city wall, and as near as practicable to\r\nthe place where the missionaries had been beheaded, and there,\r\nin the presence of all the foreign soldiers, they were themselves\r\nbeheaded.\r\n\r\nNor was this all, for Chinese officials are never natives of the\r\ncities they govern, but are sent to them from other provinces.\r\nMoreover, they usually remain in one place only a few years.\r\nThe people fear and obey them as long as they are officials, but\r\noften care little what becomes of them afterwards. They had\r\nnot befriended them during their trial and they did not attend\r\ntheir execution. The Generals therefore felt that some punishment\r\nmust be inflicted upon the city. A Chinese city is proud\r\nof the stately and ponderous towers which ornament the gates\r\nand corners of its massive wall and protect the inhabitants\r\nfrom foes, human and demoniac. All of these, but two\r\ncomparatively small ones, were blown up by order of the\r\nforeign generals. The temples which the Boxers had used for\r\ntheir meetings, including the one in which the American\r\nBoard and China Inland missionaries had been imprisoned,\r\nwere also destroyed, while the splendid official temple of the city,\r\ndedicated to its patron deity, was utterly wrecked by dynamite.\r\n\r\nNot till March 23d could memorial services be held. Then\r\na party of missionaries and friends came down from Peking.\r\nThe surviving Christians assembled. The new city officials\r\nerected a temporary pavilion on the site of the Presbyterian\r\ncompound, writing over the entrance arch: ``They held the\r\ntruth unto death.'' Within, potted flowers and decorated\r\nbanners adorned the tables and walls. The scene was solemnly\r\nimpressive. Mr. Lowrie, Dr. Wherry and Mr. Killie and\r\nothers made appropriate addresses to an audience in which\r\nthere were, besides themselves, fifteen missionaries representing\r\nfour denominations, German and French army officers, Chinese\r\nofficials and Chinese Christians. A German military band\r\nfurnished appropriate music and two Roman Catholic priests\r\nof the city sent flowers and kind letters. The following day\r\na similar service was held on the site of the American Board\r\ncompound.\r\n\r\nWe sadly visited all these places. It was about the hour of\r\nthe attack that we approached the Presbyterian compound. Of\r\nthe once pleasant homes and mission buildings, not even ruins\r\nwere left. A few hundred yards away, the site could not\r\nhave been distinguished from the rest of the open fields if my\r\ncompanions had not pointed out marks mournfully intelligible\r\nto them but hardy recognizable by a stranger. The very\r\nfoundations had been dug up by Chinese hunting for silver, and\r\nevery scrap of material had been carried away. Even the\r\ntrees and bushes had been removed by the roots and used\r\nfor firewood. In front of the site of the Simcox house are a\r\nfew unmarked mounds. All but one contain the fragments of\r\nthe bodies of the Chinese helpers and Christians, and that one,\r\nthe largest, holds the few pieces of bones which were all that\r\ncould be found in the ruins of the house in which the missionaries\r\nperished. A few more may yet be found. We ourselves\r\ndiscovered five small pieces which Dr. Charles Lewis afterwards\r\nidentified as human bones. But their charred and\r\nbroken condition showed how completely the merciful fire had\r\ndone its work of keeping the sacred remains from the hands of\r\nthose who would have shamefully misused them. The\r\nAmerican Board and China Inland Mission compounds were\r\nalso in ruins, a chaos of desolation. But as the martyred\r\nmissionaries and native Christians were beheaded and not\r\nburned, their bodies have been recovered and interred in a long\r\nrow of twenty-three graves.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations of foreign Powers with the Chinese regarding\r\nthe payment of indemnity were, as might be expected, protracted\r\nand full of difficulties. Some of the Powers favoured\r\nextreme demands which, if acceded to, would have ruined the\r\nEmpire or resulted in its immediate partition, even if they did\r\nnot cause a new and more bitter outbreak of hostilities. Other\r\nPowers, notably the United States, favoured moderate terms,\r\nholding that China should not be asked to pay sums that were\r\nclearly beyond her ability. After almost interminable disputes,\r\nthe total sum to be paid by China was, by the final protocol\r\nsigned September 7, 1901, fixed at 450,000,000 taels to be\r\npaid in thirty-nine annual installments with interest at four per\r\ncent. on the deferred payments and to be distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n   Country                               taels\r\n   Germany                                 90,070,515\r\n   Austria-Hungary                         4,003,920\r\n   Belgium                                 8,484,345\r\n   Spain                                   135,315\r\n   United States                           32,939,055[63]\r\n   France                               70,878,240\r\n   Portugal                                92,250\r\n   Great Britain                           50,712,795\r\n   Italy                                   26,617,005\r\n   Japan                                   34,793,100\r\n   Netherlands                             782,100\r\n   Russia                               230,371,120\r\n\r\nInternational (Sweden and Norway, $62,820) 212,490\r\n                                      ------------\r\n                                      450,000,000\r\n\r\n[63] The equivalent of $24,168,357.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe treaty was not calculated to make the Chinese think\r\nmore kindly of their conquerors. Besides the payment of the\r\nheavy indemnity, the Powers exacted apologies to Germany\r\nfor the murder of its minister and to Japan for the assassination\r\nof the chancellor of its legation, the erection of monuments in\r\nforeign cemeteries and the making of new commercial treaties.\r\nThe Chinese were cut to the quick by being told, among other\r\nthings, that they must not import firearms for two years;\r\nthat no official examinations would be held for five years in the\r\ncities where foreigners had been attacked; that an important\r\npart of the imperial capital would be added to the already\r\nspacious grounds of the foreign legations and that the whole\r\nwould be fortified and garrisoned by foreign guards; that the\r\nTaku forts which defended the entrance to Peking would be\r\nrazed and the railway from the sea to the capital occupied by\r\nforeign troops; that members of anti-foreign societies were to be\r\nexecuted; that magistrates even though they were viceroys\r\nwere to be summarily dismissed and disgraced if they did not\r\nprevent anti-foreign outbreaks and sternly punish their ring-\r\nleaders; that court ceremonies in relation to foreign ministers\r\nmust be conformed to Western ideas; that the Tsung-li Yamen\r\n(Foreign Office) must be abolished and a new ministry of\r\nforeign affairs erected, the Wai-wu Pu, which must be regarded\r\nas the highest of the departments instead of the lowest.\r\nChina's cup of humiliation was indeed full.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\nThe Missionary Force and the Chinese\r\nChurch\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nBEGINNINGS OF THE MISSIONARY ENTERPRISE--\r\nTHE TAI-PING REBELLION AND THE LATER\r\nDEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE first definite knowledge of the true God appears\r\nto have come to China with some Jews who are said\r\nto have entered the Empire in the third century.\r\nConjecture has long been busy with the circumstances of that\r\nancient migration. That the colony became fairly numerous\r\nmay be inferred from the fact that in 1329 and again in 1354,\r\nthe Jews are mentioned in the Chinese records of the Mongol\r\ndynasty, while early in the seventeenth century Father Ricci\r\nclaimed to have discovered a synagogue built in 1183. In\r\n1866, the Rev. Dr. W. A. P. Martin, then President of the\r\nTung-wen College at Peking, visited Kai-fung-fu, the centre of\r\nthis Jewish colony, and on a monument he found an inscription\r\nwhich included the following passage:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``With respect to the religion of Israel, we find that our first ancestor\r\nwas Adam. The founder of the religion was Abraham; then came Moses\r\nwho established the law, and handed down the sacred writings. During\r\nthe dynasty of Han (B. C. 200-A, D. 226) this religion entered China.\r\nIn the second year of Hiao-tsung, of the Sung dynasty (A. D. 1164), a\r\nsynagogue was erected in Kai-fung fu. Those who attempt to represent\r\nGod by images or pictures do but vainly occupy themselves with empty\r\nforms. Those who honour and obey the sacred writings know the origin\r\nof all things. Eternal reason and the sacred writings mutually sustain\r\neach other in testifying whence men derived their being. All those who\r\nprofess this religion aim at the practice of goodness and avoid the commission\r\nof vice.''[64]\r\n\r\n\r\n[64] Martin, ``A Cycle of Cathay,'' p. 275.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Martin writes that he inquired in the market-place:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``Are there among you any of the family of Israel?'' ``I am one,''\r\nresponded a young man, whose face corroborated his assertion; and then\r\nanother and another stepped forth until I saw before me representatives\r\nof six out of the seven families into which the colony is divided. They\r\nconfessed with shame and grief that their holy and beautiful house had\r\nbeen demolished by their own hands. It had for a long time, they said,\r\nbeen in a ruinous condition; they had no money to make repairs; they\r\nhad, moreover, lost all knowledge of the sacred tongue; the traditions of\r\nthe fathers were no longer handed down and their ritual worship had\r\nceased to be observed. In this state of things they had yielded to the\r\npressure of necessity and disposed of the timbers and stones of that venerable\r\nedifice to obtain relief for their bodily wants. . . . Their number\r\nthey estimated, though not very exactly, at from three to four hundred.\r\n. . . No bond of union remains, and they are in danger of being\r\nspeedily absorbed by Mohammedanism or heathenism.''[65]\r\n\r\n\r\n[65] Martin, ``A Cycle of Cathay,'' pp. 275, 276, 277.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is something pathetic about that forlorn remnant of the\r\nHebrew race. ``A rock rent from the side of Mount Zion\r\nby some great national catastrophe and projected into the central\r\nplain of China, it has stood there while the centuries rolled\r\nby, sublime in its antiquity and solitude.''[66]\r\n\r\n\r\n[66] Martin, p. 278.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his Life of Morrison, Townsend reminds us that the Christian\r\nChurch early realized that it could not ignore so vast a\r\nnation, while its very exclusiveness attracted bold spirits. As\r\nfar back as the first decade of the sixth century (505 A. D.),\r\nNestorian monks appear to have begun a mission in China.\r\nRomance and tragedy are suggested by the few known facts\r\nregarding that early movement. Partly impelled by conviction,\r\npartly driven by persecution, those faithful souls travelled beyond\r\nthe bounds of the Roman Empire, and rested not till they\r\nhad made the formidable journey across burning deserts and\r\nsavage mountains to the land of Sinim. That some measure\r\nof success attended their effort is probable. Indeed there are\r\nhints in the ancient records of numerous churches and of the\r\nfavour of the great Emperor Tai Tsung in 635. But however\r\nzealous the Nestorians may have been for a time, it is evident\r\nthat they were finally submerged in the sea of Chinese superstition.\r\nA quaint monument, discovered in 1625 at Hsi-an-fu,\r\nthe capital of Shen-si, on which is inscribed an outline of the\r\nNestorian effort from the year 630 to 781, is the only trace that\r\nremains of what must have been an interesting and perhaps a\r\nthrilling missionary enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic effort began in 1293, when John de\r\nCorvino succeeded in reaching Peking. Though he was elevated\r\nto an Archbishopric and reinforced by several priests,\r\nthis effort, too, proved a failure and was abandoned.\r\n\r\nTwo and a-half centuries of silence followed, and then in\r\n1552, the heroic Francis Xavier set his face towards China,\r\nonly to be prostrated by fever on the Island of Sancian. As\r\nhe despairingly realized that he would never be able to set his\r\nfoot on that still impenetrable land, he moaned: ``Oh, Rock,\r\nRock, when wilt thou open!'' and passed away.\r\n\r\nBut in 1581, another Jesuit, the learned and astute Matteo\r\nRicci, entered Canton in the guise of a Buddhist priest. He\r\nmanaged to remain, and twenty years later he went to Peking\r\nin the dress of a literary gentleman. In him Roman Catholicism\r\ngained a permanent foothold in China, and although it\r\nwas often fiercely persecuted and at times reduced to feebleness,\r\nit never became wholly extinct. Gradually it extended\r\nits influence until in 1672 the priests reported 300,000 baptized\r\nChinese, including children. In the nineteenth century,\r\nthe growth of the Roman Church was rapid. It is now\r\nstrongly entrenched in all the provinces, and in most of the\r\nleading cities its power is great. There are twenty-seven bishops\r\nand about six hundred foreign priests. The number of communicants\r\nis variously estimated, but in 1897 the Vicar Apostolic\r\nof Che-kiang, though admitting that he could not secure\r\naccurate statistics, estimated the Roman Catholic population\r\nat 750,000.\r\n\r\nIt is not to the credit of Protestantism that it was centuries\r\nbehind the Roman Church in the attempt to Christianize\r\nChina. It was not till 1807, that the first Protestant missionary\r\narrived. January 31st, of that year, Robert Morrison, then a\r\nyouth of twenty-five, sailed alone from London under appointment\r\nof the London Missionary Society (Congregational). As\r\nthe hostile East India Company would not allow a missionary\r\non any of its ships, Morrison had to go to New York in order\r\nto secure passage on an American vessel. As he paid his fare\r\nin the New York ship owner's office, the merchant said with\r\na sneer: ``And so, Mr. Morrison, you really expect that you\r\nwill make an impression on the idolatry of the great Chinese\r\nEmpire?'' ``No, sir,'' was the ringing reply, ``I expect God\r\nwill.''\r\n\r\nThe ship Trident left New York about May 15th and did\r\nnot reach Canton till September 8th. For two years Morrison\r\nhad to live and study in Canton and the Portuguese settlement\r\nof Macao with the utmost secrecy, dreading constantly that he\r\nmight be forced to leave. For a time, he never walked the\r\nstreets by daylight for fear of attracting attention, but exercised\r\nby night. His own countrymen were hostile to his purpose\r\nand his Chinese language teachers were impatient and insolent.\r\nIt was not till February 20, 1809, the date of his marriage to\r\nMiss Morton, that his employment as translator by the East\r\nIndia Company gave him a secure residence. Still, however,\r\nhe could not do open missionary work, but was obliged to present\r\nChristianity behind locked doors to the few Chinese whom\r\nhe dared to approach. In these circumstances, he naturally\r\ngave his energies largely to language study and translation,\r\nand in 1810 he had the joy of issuing a thousand copies of a\r\nChinese version of the Book of Acts.\r\n\r\nSeven weary, discouraging years passed before Morrison baptized\r\nhis first convert, July 16, 1814, and even then he had to\r\nadminister the sacrament at a lonely spot where unfriendly eyes\r\ncould not look. At his death in 1834, there were only three\r\nChinese Christians in the whole Empire. Successors carried\r\non the effort, but the door was not yet open, and the work was\r\ndone against many obstacles and chiefly in secret till the treaty\r\nof Nanking, in 1842, opened the five ports of Amoy, Canton,\r\nFoochow, Ningpo and Shanghai. Missionaries who had been\r\nwaiting and watching in the neighbouring islands promptly entered\r\nthese cities. Eagerly they looked to the great populations\r\nin the interior, but they were practically confined to the\r\nports named till 1858, when the treaty of Tien-tsin opened\r\nother cities and officially conceded the rights of missionary residence\r\nand labour.\r\n\r\nThe work now spread more rapidly, not only because it was\r\nconducted in more centres and by a larger force of missionaries,\r\nbut because it was carried into the interior regions by\r\nChinese who had heard the gospel in the ports.\r\n\r\nThe Tai-ping Rebellion soon gave startling illustration of the\r\nperversion of the new force. Begun in 1850 by an alleged\r\nChristian convert who claimed to have a special revelation from\r\nheaven as a younger brother of Christ, it spread with amazing\r\nrapidity until in 1853 it had overrun almost all that part of\r\nChina south of the Yang-tze-kiang, had occupied Nanking and\r\nShanghai, and had made such rapid progress northward that it\r\nthreatened the capital itself. It was the most stupendous revolution\r\nin history, shaking to its foundations a vast and ancient\r\nempire, involving the destruction of an almost inconceivable\r\namount of property and, it is said, of the lives of twenty millions\r\nof human beings.\r\n\r\nIf this great rebellion had been wisely guided, it would\r\nundoubtedly have changed the history of China and perhaps, by\r\nthis time, of the greater part of Asia, for it proposed to overthrow\r\nidolatry, to unseat the Manchu dynasty, and to found an\r\nempire on the principles of the Christian religion. So nearly\r\nindeed did it attain success that if it had not been opposed by\r\nEuropean nations, it would probably have attained its object.\r\nBut the weight of their influence was thrown in favour of the\r\nGovernment. The American Frederick T. Ward and the\r\nEnglish Charles George Gordon organized and led the ``Ever\r\nVictorious Army'' of Chinese troops against the revolutionists.\r\nMost significant of all, the leaders of the rebellion itself, freed\r\nfrom the restraint which foreigners might perhaps have exerted,\r\nquickly discarded whatever Christian principles they had started\r\nwith and rapidly demoralized the movement at its centre by\r\ngiving themselves up to an arrogance, vice, and cruelty which\r\nwere worse than those of the government they sought to overturn.\r\nMr. McLane, then United States Minister, truly\r\nreported to Washington:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``Whatever may have been the hopes of the enlightened and civilized\r\nnations of the earth, in regard to this movement, it is now apparent that\r\nthey neither profess nor apprehend Christianity, and whatever may be the\r\ntrue judgment to form of their political power, it can no longer be doubted\r\nthat intercourse cannot be established or maintained on terms of equality.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recapture of Nanking in 1864 marked the final turning\r\nof the tide, and in an incredibly short time the whole insurrection\r\ncollapsed. The rebellion, vast as it was, is now after\r\nall but an episode in the history of the great Empire. But the\r\nfact that any man on such a platform could so quickly develop\r\nan insurrection of such appalling proportions significantly\r\nsuggests the possibilities of change in China when new movements\r\nare rightly directed.\r\n\r\nFreed from this gigantic travesty of its true character, the\r\ngrowth of Christianity in China became more rapid. The\r\nfollowing table is eloquent:\r\n\r\n 1807 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0 communicants\r\n 1814 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1    ``\r\n 1834 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3    ``\r\n 1842 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6    ``\r\n 1853 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 350    ``\r\n 1857 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,000  ``\r\n 1865 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,000  ``\r\n 1876. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13,515  ``\r\n 1886 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 28,000 communicants\r\n 1889 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37,287    ``\r\n 1893 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 55,093    ``\r\n 1887 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 80,682    ``\r\n 1903 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 112,808   ``\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number of Protestant missionaries is 2,950, of whom\r\n1,233 are men, 868 are wives and 849 are single women. Of\r\nthe whole number, 1,483 are from Great Britain, 1,117 from\r\nAmerica and 350 from continental Europe. Other interesting\r\nstatistics are 5,000,000 adherents, 2,500 stations and out-\r\nstations, 6,388 Chinese pastors and helpers, 1,819 day-schools and\r\n170 higher institutions of learning, twenty-three mission presses\r\nwith an annual Output Of 107,149,738 pages, thirty-two periodicals,\r\n124 hospitals and dispensaries treating in a single year\r\n1,700,452 patients; while the asylums for the orphaned and\r\nblind and deaf number thirty-two.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that Christian missions in China are\r\nbeing conducted upon a large scale. It would be difficult to\r\noverestimate the silent and yet mighty energy represented by\r\nsuch work, steadily continued through a long series of years,\r\nand representing the life labours of thousands of devoted men\r\nand women and an annual expenditure of hundreds of thousands\r\nof dollars.\r\n\r\nTrue, the number of Christians is small in comparison with\r\nthe population of the Empire, but the gospel has been aptly\r\ncompared to a seed. It is indeed small, but seeds generally\r\nare. Lodged in a crevice of a rock, a seed will thrust its\r\nthread-like roots into fissures so tiny that they are hardly\r\nnoticeable. Yet in time they will rend the rock asunder and\r\nfirmly hold a stately tree. Now the seed of the gospel has been\r\nfairly lodged in the Chinese Empire. It is a seed of indestructible\r\nvitality and irresistible transforming power. It has taken\r\nroot, and it is destined to produce mighty changes. It was not\r\nwithout reason that Christianity was spoken of as a force that\r\n``turned the world upside down,'' though it only does this\r\nwhere the world was wrong side up. It is significant that the\r\nword translated ``power'' in Romans 1:16, ``The gospel is\r\nthe power of God,'' is in the Greek the word that we have\r\nanglicized in common speech as ``dynamite.'' We might,\r\ntherefore, literally translate Paul's statement: ``The gospel is\r\nthe dynamite of God.'' That dynamite has been placed under\r\nthe crust of China's conservatism, and the extraordinary\r\ntransformations that are taking place in China are, in part at least,\r\nthe results of its tremendous explosive force.\r\n\r\nThe scope of this book does not permit an extended account\r\nof the missionary movement in China. It has been given in\r\nmany volumes that are easily accessible.''[67] Nearly all of the\r\nProtestant churches, European and American, are represented\r\nand their missionaries are teaching the young, healing\r\nthe sick, translating the Word of God, creating a wholesome\r\nliterature, and preaching everywhere and with a fidelity beyond\r\nall praise the truths of the Christian religion. Self-sacrificing\r\ndevotion and patient persistence in well-doing are written on\r\nevery page of the history of missions in China, while emergencies\r\nhave developed deeds of magnificent heroism. Men and\r\nwomen have repeatedly endured persecution of the most virulent\r\nkind rather than forsake their converts, and a number ``of\r\nwhom the world was not worthy'' have laid down their lives\r\nfor conscience' sake. There are few places in all the world\r\nthat are more depressing to a white man than a Chinese city.\r\nThe dreary monotony and squalor of its life are simply indescribable.\r\nChefoo is usually considered one of the most attractive\r\ncities in China, and the missionaries who reside there\r\nare regarded as fortunate above their brethren. But even a\r\nbrief stay will convince the most sceptical that nothing but the\r\nstrongest considerations of duty could induce one who has\r\nfreedom of choice to remain any longer than is absolutely\r\nnecessary. Yet for forty-two years, missionaries have lived\r\nand toiled amid these unattractive surroundings, their houses\r\non Temple Hill in the midst of the innumerable graves which\r\noccupy almost every possible space not actually covered by the\r\nmission buildings and grounds. But steadily the missionaries\r\nhave toiled on, with faith and courage and love, and they are\r\nslowly but surely effecting marked changes. One by one, the\r\nChinese are being led to loftier views of life and while the old\r\ncity still continues to live in the ancient way, hundreds of\r\nChinese families, amid the numerous population outside of the\r\nwalls and in the outlying villages, have begun to conform\r\nthemselves to the new and higher conditions of life represented\r\nby the Christian missionaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n[67] The reader is referred to ``The Middle Kingdom,'' Williams;\r\n``Christian Progress in China,'' Foster (1889); ``Story of the China Inland\r\nMission,'' Guinness; ``China and Formosa,'' Johnston (1897);\r\nRecord of the General Conference of the Protestant Missionaries of\r\nChina held in Shanghai, 1890; Report of the Ecumenical Missionary\r\nConference held in New York, 1900; ``Mission Problems\r\nand Mission Methods in South China,'' Gibson; ``Mission Methods in\r\nManchuria,'' Ross; ``Women of the Middle Kingdom,'' McNabb;\r\n``Among the Mongols,'' Gilmour; ``East of the Barrier,'' Graham; ``In\r\nthe Far East,'' Guinness; ``The Cross and the Dragon,'' Henry; ``From\r\nFar Formosa,'' Mackay; ``Dawn on the Hills of T'ang,'' Beach; ``China\r\nand the Chinese,'' Nevius; ``Our Life in China,'' Mrs. Nevius; ``Life of\r\nJohn Livingston Nevius,'' Nevius; ``Rex Christus,'' Smith; ``John\r\nKenneth Mackenzie,'' Bryson; ``Princely Men in the Heavenly Kingdom,''\r\nBeach; ``James Gilmour of Mongolia,'' Lovett; ``Griffith John,''\r\nRobson; ``Robert Morrison,'' Townsend; ``With the Tibetans in Tent\r\nand Temple,'' Rijnhart.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral schools, a handsome church, a hospital, the only\r\ninstitution for deaf mutes in China and a wide-reaching itinerating\r\nwork, are features of the mission enterprise in Chefoo.\r\nThe visitor will be particularly interested in Dr. Hunter Corbett's\r\nstreet chapel and museum. The building is situated\r\nopposite the Chinese theatre and is well adapted to its purpose.\r\nDr. Corbett and a helper stand at the door and invite passers-by,\r\nwhile a blind boy plays on a baby organ and sings.\r\nThe chapel, which holds about sixty or seventy, is soon filled.\r\nDr. Corbett preaches to the people for half an hour and then ad-\r\nmits them to the museum which occupies several rooms in the\r\nrear. It is a wonderful place to the Chinese who never weary\r\nof watching the stuffed tiger, the model railway and the scores\r\nof interesting objects and specimens that Dr. Corbett has collected\r\nfrom various lands. Then the people leave by a door\r\nopening on the back street, another service being held with\r\nthem in the last room. Several audiences a day are thus\r\nhandled. It is hard work, for the men as a rule are from many\r\noutlying villages, unaccustomed to listening and knowing nothing\r\nof Christianity. But Dr. Corbett speaks with such animation\r\nand eloquence that not an eye is taken from him. Few\r\nare converted in the chapel, but friendships are gained, doors\r\nof opportunity opened, tracts distributed, men led to think,\r\nand on country tours Dr. Corbett invariably meets people who\r\nhave been to the museum and who cordially welcome him to\r\ntheir homes. He declares that after thirty years' experience,\r\nhe thoroughly believes in such work when followed up by\r\nfaithful itineration. Seventy-two thousand attended the chapel\r\nand museum in the year 1900 in spite of the Boxer troubles.\r\nThe chapel is open every day, except that the museum\r\nis closed on Sundays, and the attendance is now larger than\r\never.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, we strolled down to Dr. Nevius' famous orchard.\r\nIt is a beautiful spot. Here the great missionary\r\nfound his recreation after his arduous labours. Yet even in his\r\nhours of rest, he was eminently practical. Seeing that the\r\nChinese had very little good fruit and believing that he might\r\nshow them how to secure it, he brought from America seeds\r\nand cuttings, carefully cultivated them and, when they were\r\ngrown, freely distributed the new seeds and cuttings to the\r\nChinese, explaining to them the methods of cultivation. Today,\r\nas the result of his forethought and generosity, several\r\nforeign fruits have become common throughout North China.\r\nBut the orchard is deteriorating as the Chinese will not prune\r\nthe trees. They are so greedy for returns that they do not like\r\nto diminish the number of apples or plums in the interest of\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nAt sunset, I made a pilgrimage with Mrs. Nevius to the\r\ncemetery, where, after forty years of herculean toil, the mighty\r\nmissionary sleeps. We sat for a long time beside the grave, and\r\nthe aged widow, speaking of her own end, which she appeared\r\nto feel could not be far distant, said that she wished to be buried\r\nbeside her husband and that for this reason she did not want\r\nto go to the United States, preferring to remain in Chefoo until\r\nher summons came.\r\n\r\nThe scene was very beautiful as the sun set and the moon\r\nrose above the quiet sea. Standing beside the grave of the\r\nhonoured dead and under the solemn pines, the traveller gains\r\na new sense of the beneficence and dignity of the missionary\r\nforce that is operating through such consecrated lives of the\r\nliving and the dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nMISSIONARIES AND NATIVE LAWSUITS\r\n\r\nIN considering the effects of the operation of this missionary\r\nforce, we are at once confronted by the complaint of\r\nmany Chinese that missionaries interfere on behalf of their\r\nconverts in lawsuits. This complaint has been taken up and\r\ncirculated by foreign critics until it has become one of the most\r\nformidable of the objections to missionary work. The difficulty\r\nwill be understood when we remember that, though the Chinese\r\nare not a warlike people, they are litigious to an extraordinary\r\ndegree. The struggle for existence in such a densely populated\r\ncountry often results in real or fancied entanglements of rights.\r\nSo the Chinese are forever disputing about something, and the\r\nmagistrates and village headmen are beset by clamorous hordes\r\nwho demand a settlement of their alleged grievances. Naturally\r\nthe Chinese Christians do not at once outgrow this national\r\ndisposition. Whether they do or not, their profession of Christianity\r\nmakes them an easy mark for the greedy and envious.\r\nJealousy and dislike of the native who abandons the faith of his\r\nfathers and espouses ``the foreigner's religion'' frequently\r\nhale him into court on trumped-up charges and the notorious\r\nprejudice and corruption of the average magistrate often\r\nresult in grievous persecution. The terrified Christian naturally\r\nimplores the missionary to save him. It is hard to\r\nresist such an appeal. But the defendant is not always so\r\ninnocent as he appears to be, and whether innocent or guilty,\r\nthe interference of the foreigner irritates both magistrate\r\nand prosecutor, while it not infrequently arouses the resentment\r\nof the whole community by giving the idea that\r\nthe Christians are a privileged class who are not amenable\r\nto the ordinary laws of the land. When, as sometimes happens,\r\nthe Christians themselves get that idea and presume upon\r\nit, the difficulty becomes acute. Speaking of the Chinese\r\ntalent for indirection, the Rev. Dr. Arthur H. Smith\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``It is this which makes it so difficult for the most conscientious and\r\ndiscreet missionary to be quite sure that he is in possession of all the\r\nneeded data in any given case. The difficulty in getting at the bottom\r\nfacts frequently is that there are no facts available, and, as the pilots say,\r\n`no bottom.' Every Protestant missionary is anxious to have his flock of\r\nChristians such as fear God and work righteousness, but in the effort to\r\ncompass this end he not infrequently finds that when endeavouring to\r\ninvestigate the `facts' in any case he is chasing a school of cuttlefish\r\nthrough seas of ink.''[68]\r\n\r\n\r\n[68] ``Rex Christus,'' pp. 103, 107.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn illustration of this occurred during my visit in Ichou-fu.\r\nA magistrate who needed some wheelbarrows sent out his men\r\nto impress them. The rule in such cases is that only empty\r\nbarrows can be seized. But the yamen underlings found the\r\nfather of a mission helper with loaded barrows at an inn, stole\r\nhis goods and forced him to pay them a sum of money for the\r\nprivilege of keeping his barrows. The helper complained and\r\nDr. C. F. Johnson yielded only so far as to write a guarded\r\nletter to the magistrate simply stating his confidence that if the\r\nmagistrate found that injustice had been done, he would\r\nremedy it. But that letter brought the missionary into the\r\ncase and he found himself forced to see it through or ``lose\r\nface'' with the Chinese Christians and especially the helper\r\nwho was the son of the man robbed. He soon discovered,\r\nmoreover, that the wronged man was telling contradictory\r\nstories about the value of goods stolen and the amount of\r\nmoney he had to pay to save his barrows. The situation\r\nspeedily became embarrassing and the sorely-tried missionary,\r\nthough he had acted from the best of motives and in the most\r\nconservative way, vowed that he would never interfere again\r\nin such disputes, as irritation and harm were almost certain to\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nI asked Sir Robert Hart whether in his opinion a missionary\r\nshould seek to obtain justice for a persecuted man or should\r\nremain silent? He replied:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``Intervention in matters litigated ought to be absolutely eschewed. Let\r\nthe missionary content himself with making his disciples good men and\r\ngood citizens, and let him leave it to the duly authorized officials to\r\ninterpret and apply the law and administer their affairs in their own way.\r\nIndividual Christianity has as many shades and degrees as men's faces.\r\nThere are converts and converts, but even the most godly of them may\r\ngive his neighbour just reason to take offense, and the most saintly among\r\nthem may get involved in the meshes of the law. In such cases let the\r\nmissionary stand aloof. There is, too, such a thing as hypocrisy, much\r\nbetter let the schemer get his deserts than hurt the church's character by\r\nfollowing sentiment into interference. You ask what is to be done when\r\nthere is persecution to be dealt with? First of all, I would advise the\r\nindividual or the community to live it down, and, as a last resort, report\r\nthe fact with appropriate detail and proof to the Legation in Peking for\r\nthe assistance and advice of the minister. `Watch thou in all things,\r\nendure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy\r\nministry.' ''\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is customary for the friends of Protestant missionaries to\r\nanswer the critic's charge of interference in native lawsuits by\r\nstating that it does not justly lie against them, but only against\r\nthe Roman Catholics, the rule of the Protestant missionaries\r\nbeing to avoid such interference save in rare and extreme cases.\r\nMr. Alexander Michie, however, declares that Protestant missionaries\r\nare not entitled to such exemption, and that, while\r\nthey may not interfere so frequently as the Catholics, they\r\nnevertheless interfere often enough to bring them under the\r\nsame condemnation.[69]\r\n\r\n\r\n[69] Address in Shanghai, 1901.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are undoubtedly cases of imprudence, but after diligent\r\ninquiry, I am persuaded that the Protestant missionaries\r\nas a class are keenly alive to the risks of interference in native\r\nlawsuits and that they are increasingly careful in this respect.\r\nThey feel with the Rev. J. C. Garritt of Hangchow that ``the\r\nmost important form which prejudice has taken of late is the\r\nbelief that foreigners aid or at least countenance their converts\r\nin the carrying of lawsuits through the yamens, or in the\r\nbusiness of private settlement of disputes, and that if we can\r\nonly practically demonstrate to the public that we are not in\r\nthat business, we shall have overcome one very serious obstacle\r\nto our work.''\r\n\r\n``The policy of the Chinese Government during the past\r\nfew years has been to avoid trouble by letting the foreigner\r\nhave his own way whenever possible. More than once the\r\nChinese official has said in substance to non-Christian litigants:\r\n`You are right and your Christian accusers are wrong; but if\r\nI decide in your favour the foreigner will appeal the case to the\r\nGovernor or to the Peking foreign office and I shall suffer.'\r\nSuch things are charged, justly or unjustly, to the account of\r\nboth Protestant and Romanist.''[70]\r\n\r\n\r\n[70] The Rev. Dr. L. J. Davies, Tsing-tau.\r\n\r\n\r\nA broad induction as to the facts has been made by the\r\nRev. Dr. Paul D. Bergen, President of Shantung Protestant\r\nUniversity. He wrote to a large number of missionaries representing\r\nall Protestant denominations as to their practice and\r\nconvictions regarding this subject. Seventy-three answered\r\nand Dr. Bergen tabulated their replies. As to the results of\r\nthe concrete cases of intervention cited, fifty-three are reported\r\nto have been beneficial, twenty-six are characterized as doubtful,\r\nfour as mixed and sixty-seven as bad. This leaves the\r\nremaining cases ``suspended in the air,'' and Dr. Bergen conjectures\r\nthat ``perhaps the missionary felt in such a confused\r\nmental state at their conclusion, that he was quite unable to\r\nwork out the complicated equation of their results.''\r\n\r\n``But surely the result that only fifty-three cases are reported\r\nto have been of unmistakable benefit, while sixty-seven are set\r\ndown as resulting in evil, ought to give us thought. In short,\r\nin the yamen intercession in behalf of prosecuted Christians,\r\nit is the deliberate opinion of seventy-three missionaries that, as\r\na matter of personal experience, sixty-seven cases have wrought\r\nonly evil, while only fifty-three have been productive of good.\r\nThe balance is on the wrong side. We must decide, in view\r\nof these replies, that there exists in general rather a pessimistic\r\nopinion as to the advantages of applying to the yamen in behalf\r\nof Christians.''\r\n\r\nSumming up briefly the results of this inquiry, we note the\r\nfollowing points, which will embody the views of a very large\r\nmajority of the Protestant missionaries of experience in the\r\nEmpire:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``First,--That it is highly desirable to keep church troubles out of the\r\nyamen, but that there are times when we cannot do so without violating\r\nour sense of justice and our sense of duty towards an injured brother.\r\n\r\n``Second,--Official assistance is to be sought in such troubles only when\r\nall other means of relief have been tried in vain. Always seek to settle\r\nthese difficulties out of court.\r\n\r\n``Third,--When official assistance is requested, our bearing should be\r\nfriendly and courteous in the spirit, at least in the first instance, of asking\r\na favour of the official, rather than demanding a right.... We\r\nshould be extremely careful about trying to bring pressure to bear on an\r\nofficial.\r\n\r\n``Fourth,--In the presence of the native Christian, and especially of\r\nthose chiefly concerned, as well as in our own closets, we should cherish\r\na deep sense of our absolute dependence on heavenly rather than on\r\nearthly protection, and remind the Christians that, as Dr. Taylor has so\r\ntersely put it, their duty is `to do good, suffer for it and take it patiently.'\r\n\r\n``Fifth,--Only in grave cases should matters be pushed to the point of\r\ncontroversy or formal appeal.\r\n\r\n``Sixth,--Christians and evangelists should be solemnly warned against\r\nbetraying an arrogant spirit upon the successful termination of any\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n``Seventh,--Previous to the carrying of a case before the official, let the\r\nmissionary be sure of his facts. Each case should be patiently, thoroughly\r\nand firmly examined. Receive individual testimony with judicious reserve.\r\nBe not easily blinded by appeals to the emotions. Be especially\r\nready to receive any one from the opposition, and give his words due\r\nweight. Do not be too exclusively influenced by the judgment of any one\r\nman, however trusted.\r\n\r\n``Eighth,--In the course of negotiation beware of insisting on monetary\r\ncompensation for the injured Christian. In greatly aggravated cases this\r\nmay occasionally be unavoidable. But should it be made a condition of\r\nsettlement, see to it that the damages are under, rather than over, what\r\nmight have been demanded. It is almost sure to cause subsequent\r\ntrouble, both within and without, if a Christian receives money under\r\nsuch circumstances.\r\n\r\n``Ninth,--When unhappily involved in a persecution case with the official,\r\nwe should remember that we are not lawyers, and therefore make no\r\nstand on legal technicalities, nor allow ourselves to take a threatening\r\nattitude, although we may be subjected to provocation; we should be\r\npatient, dignified and strong in the truth, making it clear to the official that\r\nthis is all that we seek in order that the ends of justice may be satisfied.\r\n\r\n``Tenth,--It would be well on every fitting occasion to exhort those under\r\nour care to avoid frequenting yamens or cultivating intimacy with\r\ntheir inhabitants, unless, indeed, we feel assured that their motive is the\r\nsame as that animating our Lord when He mingled with publicans and\r\nsinners.''\r\n\r\n\r\nA widely representative conference of Protestant missionaries\r\nissued in 1903 the following manifesto and sent copies in\r\nChinese to all officials throughout the Empire:\r\n\r\n\r\n``Chinese Christians, though church-members, remain in every respect\r\nChinese citizens, and are subject to the properly constituted Chinese\r\nauthorities. The sacred Scriptures and the doctrines of the church teach\r\nobedience to all lawful authority and exhort to good citizenship; and these\r\ndoctrines are preached in all Protestant churches. The relation of a missionary\r\nto his converts is thus that of a teacher to his disciples, and he\r\ndoes not desire to arrogate to himself the position or power of a magistrate.\r\n\r\n``Unfortunately, it sometimes happens that unworthy men, by making insincere\r\nprofessions, enter the church and seek to use this connection to\r\ninterfere with the ordinary course of law in China. We all agree that\r\nsuch conduct is entirely reprehensible, and we desire it to be known that\r\nwe give no support to this unwarrantable practice\r\n\r\n``On this account we desire to state that for the information of all that:\r\n(a) The Protestant Church does not wish to interfere in law cases. All\r\ncases between Christians and non-Christians must be settled in the courts\r\nin the ordinary way. Officials are called upon to administer fearlessly and\r\nimpartially justice to all within their jurisdiction. (b) Native Christians\r\nare strictly forbidden to use the name of the church or its officers in the\r\nhope of strengthening their positions when they appear before magistrates.\r\nThe native pastors and preachers are appointed for teaching and exhortation,\r\nand are chosen because of their worthy character to carry on this\r\nwork. To prevent abuses in the future, all officials are respectfully requested\r\nto report to the missionary every case in which letters or cards using\r\nthe name of the church or any of its officers are brought into court.\r\nThen proper inquiry will be made and the truth become clear.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThe policy of the British Government on this subject was\r\nclearly expressed by Earl Granville in his note of August 21,\r\n1871, to the British Minister at Peking:\r\n\r\n\r\n``The policy and practice of the Government of Great Britain have been\r\nunmistakable. They have uniformly declared, and now repeat, that they\r\ndo not claim to afford any species of protection to Chinese Christians\r\nwhich may be construed as withdrawing them from their native allegiance,\r\nnor do they desire to secure to British missionaries any privileges\r\nor immunities beyond those granted by treaty to other British subjects.\r\nThe Bishop of Victoria was requested to intimate this to the Protestant\r\nmissionary societies in the letter addressed to him by Mr. Hammond by\r\nthe Earl of Clarendon's direction on the 13th of November, 1869, and to\r\npoint out that they would `do well to warn converts that although the\r\nChinese Government may be bound by treaty not to persecute, on account\r\nof their conversion, Chinese subjects who may embrace Christianity,\r\nthere is no provision in the treaty by which a claim can be made on behalf\r\nof converts for exemption from the obligations of their natural allegiance,\r\nand from the jurisdiction of the local authorities. Under the creed\r\nof their adoption, as under that of their birth, Chinese converts to Christianity\r\nstill owe obedience to the law of China, and if they assume to set\r\nthemselves above those laws, in reliance upon foreign protection, they\r\nmust take the consequence of their own indiscretion, for no British authority,\r\nat all events, can interfere to save them.' ''\r\n\r\n\r\nThe policy of the United States Government was stated with\r\nequal clearness in a note of the Hon. Frederick F. Low,\r\nUnited States Minister at Peking, to the Tsung-li Yamen, dated\r\nMarch 20, 1871:\r\n\r\n\r\n``The Government of the United States, while it claims to exercise, under\r\nand by virtue of the stipulations of treaty, the exclusive right of judging\r\nof the wrongful acts of its citizens resident in China, and of punishing\r\nthem when found guilty according to its own laws, does not assume to\r\nclaim or exercise any authority or control over the natives of China. This\r\nrule applies equally to merchants and missionaries, and, so far as I know,\r\nall foreign Governments having treaties with China adhere strictly to this\r\nrule. In case, however, missionaries see that native Christians are being\r\npersecuted by the local officials on account of their religious opinions, in\r\nviolation of the letter and spirit of the twenty-ninth article of the treaty\r\nbetween the United States and China, it would be proper, and entirely in\r\naccordance with the principles of humanity and the teachings of their religion,\r\nto make respectful representation of the facts in such cases to the\r\nlocal authorities direct, or through their diplomatic representative to the\r\nforeign office; for it cannot be presumed that the Imperial Government\r\nwould sanction any violation of treaty engagement, or that the local officials\r\nwould allow persecutions for opinion's sake, when once the facts are\r\nmade known to them. In doing this the missionaries should conform to\r\nChinese custom and etiquette, so far as it can be done without assuming\r\nan attitude that would be humiliating and degrading to themselves.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question is one of the most difficult and delicate of all\r\nthe questions with which the missionary must deal. On the\r\none hand, every impulse of justice and humanity prompts him\r\nto befriend a good man who is being persecuted for righteousness'\r\nsake. But on the other hand, sore experience has\r\ntaught him the necessity of caution. The pressure upon him is\r\nso frequent and trying that it becomes the bete noire of his life.\r\nThe outsider may wisely hesitate before he adds to that pressure.\r\nThe citations that have been given show that the missionaries\r\nthemselves understand the question quite as well as\r\nany one else and that they are competent to deal with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nMISSIONARIES AND THEIR OWN GOVERNMENTS\r\n\r\nTHE relation of the missionary to the consular and\r\ndiplomatic representatives of his own government is\r\nanother topic of perennial criticism. Some European\r\nGovernments have persistently and notoriously sought to advance\r\ntheir national interest through their missionaries. France\r\nand Russia have been particularly active in this way, the\r\nformer claiming large rights by virtue of its position as ``the\r\nprotector of Catholic missions.'' The result is that the\r\naverage Chinese official regards all missionaries as political\r\nagents who are to be watched and feared. Dr. L. J. Davies, a\r\nPresbyterian missionary, says that he has been repeatedly asked\r\nhis rank as ``an American official,'' whether he ``reported in\r\nperson'' to his ``emperor'' on his return to his native land,\r\nhow much salary his government allowed him, and many\r\nother questions the import of which was manifest.\r\n\r\nThe typical consul and minister, moreover, find that no\r\nsmall part of their business relates to matters that are brought to\r\ntheir attention by missionaries. Sometimes they manifest impatience\r\non this account. One consul profanely complained to\r\nme that three-fourths of his business related to the missionary\r\nquestion. He forgot, however, that nine-tenths of the nationals\r\nunder his jurisdiction were missionaries, so that in proportion to\r\ntheir numbers, the missionaries gave him less trouble than the\r\nnon-missionary Americans. In answer to an inquiry by the\r\nRev. Dr. Paul D. Bergen, of the Presbyterian Mission, seventy-\r\nthree missionaries, of from five to thirty years' experience, and\r\nrepresenting most of the Protestant boards, reported a total of\r\nonly fifty-two applications through consul or minister. The\r\nHon. John Barrett, formerly Minister of the United States to\r\nSiam, writes: ``Let us be fair in judging the missionaries.\r\nLet the complaining merchant, traveller or clubman take the\r\nbeam from his own eye before he demands that the mote be\r\ntaken from the missionary's eye. In my diplomatic experience\r\nin Siam, 150 missionaries gave me less trouble in five years\r\nthan fifteen merchants gave me in five months.''\r\n\r\nDoubtless some diplomats would be glad to have the missionaries\r\nexpatriate themselves. In the United States Senate\r\nthe Hon. John Sherman is reported to have said that ``if our\r\ncitizens go to a far-distant country, semi-civilized and bitterly\r\nopposed to their movements, we cannot follow them there and\r\nprotect them. They ought to come home.'' Is, then, the\r\nmissionary's business less legitimate than the trader's? Is a\r\nman entitled to the protection of his country if he goes to the\r\nOrient to sell whiskey and rifles, but does he forfeit that protection\r\nif he goes there to preach the gospel of temperance and\r\npeace?\r\n\r\nCritics may be reminded that missionaries are American citizens;\r\nthat when gamblers and drunkards and adventurers and\r\ndistillery agents in China claim the rights of citizenship, the\r\nmissionary does not forfeit his rights by a residence in China\r\nfor the purpose of teaching the young, healing the sick, distributing\r\nthe Bible and preaching the gospel of Christ, particularly\r\nwhen treaties expressly guarantee him protection in the\r\nexercise of these very privileges. It is odd to find some people\r\ninsisting that a dissolute trader should be allowed to go\r\nwherever he pleases and raising a tremendous hubbub if a hair\r\nof his head is injured, while at the same time they appear to\r\ndeem it an unwarranted thing for a decent man to go to China\r\non a mission of peace and good-will.\r\n\r\nWhile the individual missionary is, of course, free to\r\nrenounce his claim to the protection of home citizenship,\r\nsuch renunciation is neither necessary nor expedient. There\r\nis not the slightest probability that our Government will require\r\nit, and if it should, the public sentiment of the United States\r\nwould not tolerate such an order for a week. No self-respecting\r\nnation can expatriate its citizens who go abroad to do good.\r\nThe policy of the United States was indicated in the note of\r\nthe Hon. J. C. B. Davis, acting Secretary of State, to the\r\nUnited States Minister at Peking, October 19, 1871.\r\n\r\n\r\n``The rights of citizens of the United States in China are well defined\r\nby treaty. So long as they attend peaceably to their affairs they are to\r\nbe placed on a common footing of amity and good-will with subjects of\r\nChina, and are to receive and enjoy for themselves, and everything appertaining\r\nto them, protection and defense from all insults and injuries.\r\nThey have the right to reside at any of the ports open to foreign commerce,\r\nto rent houses and places of business, or to build such upon sites\r\nwhich they have the right to hire. They have secured to them the right\r\nto build churches and cemeteries, and they may teach or worship in those\r\nchurches without being harassed, persecuted, interfered with, or molested.\r\nThese are some of the rights which are expressly and in terms granted to\r\nthe United States, for their citizens, by the Treaty of 1858. If I rightly\r\napprehend the spirit of the note of the Foreign Office, and of the regulations\r\nwhich accompany it, there is, to state it in the least objectionable\r\nform, an apprehension in the yamen that it may become necessary to curtail\r\nsome of these rights, in consequence of the alleged conduct of French\r\nmissionaries. This idea cannot be entertained for one moment by the\r\nUnited States.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThis position was given new emphasis by the note sent by\r\nSecretary of State John Hay to the Hon. Horace Porter, United\r\nStates Ambassador to France, in response to a communication\r\nfrom the American Chamber of Commerce in Paris in 1903.\r\nIn this note Mr. Hay said:\r\n\r\n\r\n``The Government holds that every citizen sojourning or travelling\r\nabroad in pursuit of his lawful affairs is entitled to a passport, and the\r\nduration of such sojourn the department does not arrogate to itself the right\r\nto limit or prescribe.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThe governments of continental Europe have repeatedly\r\nshown themselves quick to resent an infringement upon the\r\ntreaty rights of their subjects who are in China as missionaries.\r\nThe Hon. Thomas Francis Wade, British Minister at Peking,\r\nwrote to Minister Wen Hsiang in June, 1871:--``The British\r\nGovernment draws no distinction between the missionaries and\r\nany other of its non-official subjects.'' This sentiment was emphatically\r\nreiterated by Earl Granville in a note from the foreign\r\noffice in London to Mr. Wade dated August 21, 1871:\r\n\r\n\r\n``Her Majesty's Government cannot allow the claim that the missionaries\r\nresiding in China must conform to the laws and customs of China to\r\npass unchallenged. It is the duty of a missionary, as of every other British\r\nsubject, to avoid giving offense as far as possible to the Chinese authorities\r\nor people, but he does not forfeit the rights to which he is entitled under\r\nthe treaty as a British subject because of his missionary character.''\r\n\r\n\r\nBut while this is the only possible policy for a government,\r\nit is surely reasonable to expect that the persons concerned will\r\nexercise moderation and prudence in their demands. The\r\nChina Island Mission does not permit its missionaries to appeal\r\nto their Government officials without special permission from\r\nheadquarters. Many missionaries of other societies would\r\nprobably resent such a limitation of their liberty as citizens.\r\nBut as the act of the individual often involves others, it might\r\nbe well to make the approval of the station necessary, and,\r\nwherever practicable, of the mission. Nine-tenths of the\r\nmissionaries do not and will not unnecessarily write or\r\ntelegraph for the intervention of minister or consul. But the\r\ntenth man may be benefited by the counsel of his colleagues\r\nwho know or who may be easily acquainted with the facts.\r\nThe American Presbyterian Board in a formal action has expressed\r\nthe wise judgment that ``appeals to the secular arm\r\nshould always and everywhere be as few as possible.'' It is\r\nnot in the civil or military power of a country to give the\r\nmissionary success. In the crude condition of heathen\r\nsociety, the temptation is sometimes strong to appeal for aid to\r\n``the secular arm'' of the home government. Occasions may\r\npossibly arise in which it will be necessary to insist upon rights.\r\nNevertheless, as a rule, it will be well to remember that ``the\r\nweapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through\r\nGod,'' and that ``the servant of the Lord must not strive, but\r\nbe gentle unto all men.'' The argument of the sword is\r\nMohammedan, not Christian. The veteran Rev. J. Hudson\r\nTaylor holds that in the long run appeals to home governments\r\ndo nothing but harm. He says he has known of many riots\r\nthat have never been reported and of much suffering endured\r\nin silence which have ``fallen out rather to the furtherance of\r\nthe gospel,'' and that ``if we leave God to vindicate our\r\ncause, the issue is sure to prove marvellous in spirituality.''\r\n\r\nThe critics have vociferously charged that after the suppression\r\nof the Boxer uprising, the missionaries greatly embarrassed\r\ntheir governments by demanding bloody vengeance\r\nupon the Chinese. It may indeed be true that among the\r\nthousands of Roman Catholic and Protestant missionaries in\r\nChina, some temporarily lost their self-control and gave way to\r\nanger under the awful provocation of ruined work, burned\r\nhomes, outraged women and butchered Chinese Christians.\r\nHow many at home would or could have remained calm in\r\nsuch circumstances? But it is grossly unjust to treat such\r\nexcited utterances as representative of the great body of\r\nmissionary opinion. The missionaries went to China and\r\nthey propose to stay there because they love and believe in the\r\nChinese, and it is very far from their thought to demand undue\r\npunishment for those who oppose them. They sensibly\r\nexpected a certain amount of opposition from tradition,\r\nheathenism, superstition and corruption, and they are not disposed\r\nto call for unmanly or unchristian measures when that\r\ntrouble falls upon them which fell in even greater measure on\r\nthe Master Himself.\r\n\r\nIt is true that some of the missionaries felt that the ring-\r\nleaders of the Boxers, including those in high official position\r\nwho more or less secretly incited them to violence, should be\r\npunished. But they were not thinking of revenge, so much as\r\nof the welfare of China, the restoration to power of the best element\r\namong the Chinese, and the reasonable security of\r\nChinese Christians and of foreigners who have treaty rights.\r\nMany missionaries feel that there is no hope for China save in\r\nthe predominance of the Reform Party, and that if the reactionaries\r\nare to remain in control, the outlook is dark indeed,\r\nnot so much for the foreigner as for China itself. The men\r\nwho were guilty of the atrocities perpetrated in the summer of\r\n1900 violated every law, human and divine, and some of the\r\nmissionaries demanded their punishment only in the same\r\nspirit as the ministers and Christian people of the United\r\nStates who with united voice demanded the punishment of the\r\nfour young men in Paterson, New Jersey, who had been\r\nsystematically outraging young girls.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as to the whole subject of the policy which\r\nshould be adopted by our Government in China, I believe that\r\nit would be wise for both the missionaries and the mission\r\nboards to be cautious in proffering advice, and to leave the\r\nresponsibility for action with the lawfully constituted civil\r\nauthorities upon whom the people have placed it. Governments\r\nhave better facilities for acquiring accurate information\r\nas to political questions than missionaries have. They can see\r\nthe bearings of movements more clearly than those who are\r\nnot in political life and can discern elements in the situation\r\nthat are not so apparent to others. Moreover, they must bear\r\nthe blame or praise for consequences. They can ask for\r\nmissionary opinion if they want it. Generations of protest\r\nagainst priestly domination, chiefly by Protestant ministers\r\nthemselves, have developed in both Europe and America a disposition\r\nto resent clerical interference in political questions.\r\nThis is particularly true of matters in Asia, where the political\r\nsituation is so delicate. The opinions publicly expressed by\r\nthe missionaries as to the policy, which, in their judgment,\r\nshould be adopted by our Government and by the European\r\nPowers have included not only many articles of individual\r\nmissionaries in newspapers and magazines, but formal communications\r\nof bodies or committees of missionaries. Conspicuous\r\nexamples are the protests of missionaries assembled in\r\nChefoo and Shanghai in 1900 against the decision of the\r\nAmerican Government to withdraw its troops from Peking, to\r\nrecognize the Empress Dowager and to omit certain officials\r\nfrom the list of those who were to be executed or banished, and,\r\nin particular, the letter addressed by ``the undersigned\r\nBritish and American missionaries representative of societies\r\nand organizations that have wide interests in China to their\r\nExcellencies the Plenipotentiaries of Great Britain and the\r\nUnited States accredited to the Chinese Government.''\r\n\r\nThese actions were taken by men whose character, ability\r\nand knowledge of the Chinese entitle them to great weight, and\r\nwho were personally affected in the security of their lives and\r\nproperty and in the interests of their life-work by the policy\r\nadopted by their respective Governments. All were citizens who\r\ndid not abdicate their citizenship by becoming missionaries,\r\nand whose status and rights in China, as such, have been\r\nspecifically recognized by treaty. All, moreover, expressed\r\ntheir views with clearness, dignity and force. From the viewpoint\r\nof right and privilege, and, indeed, political duty as\r\ncitizens, they were abundantly justified in expressing their\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are many friends of missions who\r\ndoubt whether formal declarations of judgment ``as missionaries,''\r\non political and military questions, were accorded much\r\ninfluence by diplomats; whether they did not increase the\r\npopular criticism of missionaries to an extent which more than\r\ncounterbalanced any good that they accomplished; whether\r\nthey did not identify the missionary cause with ``the consul\r\nand gunboat'' policy which Lord Salisbury charged upon it;\r\nand whether they did not prejudice their own future influence\r\nover the Chinese and strengthen the impression that the mis-\r\nsionaries are ``political emissaries.'' In reply to my inquiry as\r\nto his opinion, Sir Robert Hart expressed himself as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``As for punitive measures, etc., I have really no personal knowledge\r\nof the action taken by American missionaries, and hearsay is not a good\r\nfoundation for opinion. It is said that vindictive feeling rather than tender\r\nmercy has been noticed. But even if so, it cannot be wondered at, so\r\ncruel were the Chinese assailants when they had the upper hand. The\r\noccasion has been altogether anomalous, and it is only at the parting of\r\nthe ways the difference of view comes in. That what was done merited\r\nalmost wholesale punishment is a view most will agree in--eyes turned to\r\nthe past--but when discussion tries to argue out what will be best for the\r\nfuture, some will vote for striking terror, and others for trusting more to\r\nthe more slowly working but longer lasting effect of mercy. I do not believe\r\nany missionary has brought anybody to punishment who did not\r\nrichly deserve it. But some people seem to feel it would have been wiser\r\nfor ministers of the gospel to have left to `governors' the `punishment of\r\nevil-doers.' For my part, I cannot blame them, for without their assistance\r\nmuch that is known would not have been known, and, although numbers\r\nof possibly innocent, inoffensive and non-hostile people may have been\r\noverwhelmed in this last year's avalanche of disaster, there are still at\r\nlarge a lot of men whose punishment would probably have been a good\r\nthing for the future. One can only hope that their good luck in escaping\r\nmay lead them to take a new departure, and with their heads in the right\r\ndirection.''[71]\r\n\r\n\r\n[71] Letter to the author with permission to print, July, 1901.\r\n\r\n\r\nWisely or unwisely--the former, I venture to think--the\r\ninterdenominational conference of American mission boards having\r\nwork in China, held in 1900, declined to make representations\r\nto our Government on questions of policy during the Boxer\r\nuprising. They necessarily had much correspondence with\r\nWashington regarding the safety of missionaries during the\r\nsiege, but when I inquired of Secretary of State Hay as to the\r\naccuracy of the later newspaper charges that mission boards\r\nwere urging the Government to retaliatory measures, he promptly\r\nreplied: ``No communications of this nature have been received\r\nfrom the great mission boards or from their authorized\r\nrepresentatives.''\r\n\r\nBut let us hear the missionaries themselves on this subject.\r\nAn interdenominational committee, headed by the Rev. Dr.\r\nCalvin W. Mateer, prepared a reply to this criticism, which has\r\nbeen circulated throughout China and has received the assent\r\nof so large a number of missionaries of all churches and nationalities\r\nthat it may be taken as representing the views of fully\r\nnine-tenths of the whole body of Protestant missionaries in the\r\nEmpire. This letter should be given the widest possible currency,\r\nas expressing the views of men who are the peers of any\r\nequal number of Christian workers in the world. It is dated\r\nMay 24, 1901, and, after discussing the question of the responsibility\r\nfor the Boxer uprising, the letter continues:\r\n\r\n\r\n``With reference to the second point--that we have manifested an unchristian\r\nspirit in suggesting the punishment of those who were guilty of\r\nthe massacre of foreigners and native Christians--we understand that the\r\ncriticism applies chiefly to the message sent by the public meeting held in\r\nShanghai in September last.\r\n\r\n``1. It should, in the first place, be borne in mind that the resolutions\r\npassed at that meeting were called for by the proposal of the Allies to\r\nevacuate Peking immediately after the relief of the Legations. It was\r\nfelt, not only by missionaries but by the whole of the foreign residents in\r\nChina, that such a course would be fraught with the greatest disaster, inasmuch\r\nas it would give sanction to further lawlessness.\r\n\r\n``2. Further it must be remembered that, while suggesting that a satisfactory\r\nsettlement `should include the adequate punishment of all who\r\nwere guilty of the recent murders of foreigners and native Christians,'\r\nit was left to the Powers to decide what that `adequate punishment'\r\nshould be. Moreover, when taking such measures as were necessary,\r\nthey were urged to `make every effort to avoid all needless and\r\nindiscriminate slaughter of Chinese and destruction of their property.'\r\n\r\n``3. By a strange misunderstanding we find that this suggestion has\r\nbeen interpreted as though it were animated by an unchristian spirit of\r\nrevenge. With the loss of scores of friends and colleagues still fresh upon\r\nus, and with stories of cruel massacres reaching us day by day, it would\r\nnot have been surprising had we been betrayed into intemperate expressions;\r\nbut we entirely repudiate the idea which has been read into our\r\nwords. If governments are the ministers of God's righteousness, then\r\nsurely it is the duty of every Christian Government not only to uphold the\r\nright but to put down the wrong, and equally the duty of all Christian\r\nsubjects to support them in so doing. For China, as for Western nations,\r\nanarchy is the only alternative to law. Both justice and mercy require\r\nthe judicial punishment of the wrong-doers in the recent outrages. For\r\nthe good of the people themselves, for the upholding of that standard of\r\nrighteousness which they acknowledge and respect, for the strengthening\r\nand encouragement of those officials whose sympathies have been throughout\r\non the side of law and order, and for the protection of our own helpless\r\nwomen and children and the equally helpless sons and daughters of\r\nthe Church, we think that such violations of treaty obligations, and such\r\nheartless and unprovoked massacres as have been carried out by official\r\nauthority or sanction, should not be allowed to pass unpunished. It is\r\nnot of our personal wrongs that we think, but of the maintenance of law\r\nand order, and of the future safety of all foreigners residing in the interior\r\nof China, who, it must be remembered, are not under the jurisdiction of\r\nChinese law, but, according to the treaties, are immediately responsible to,\r\nand under the protection of, their respective Governments.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reply rather pathetically concludes:\r\n\r\n\r\n``It is unhappily the lot of missionaries to be misunderstood and spoken\r\nagainst, and we are aware that in any explanation we now offer we add\r\nto the risk of further misunderstanding; but we cast ourselves on the forbearance\r\nof our friends, and beg them to refrain from hasty and ill-formed\r\njudgments. If, on our part, there have been extreme statements, if individual\r\nmissionaries have used intemperate words or have made demands\r\nout of harmony with the spirit of our Divine Lord, is it too much to ask\r\nthat the anguish and peril through which so many of our number have\r\ngone during the last six months should be remembered, and that the whole\r\nbody should not be made responsible for the hasty utterances of the\r\nfew?''\r\n\r\n\r\nA perplexing phase of the relation of missionaries to their\r\nown governments develops in times of disturbance. Should\r\nmissionaries remain at their stations when their minister or consul\r\nthink that they ought to withdraw to the port where they\r\ncan be more easily protected? Should they make journeys\r\nthat the consul deems imprudent or return to an abandoned\r\nstation before he regards the trouble as ended? This question\r\nbecame acute in connection with the Boxer outbreak when mis-\r\nsionaries sometimes differed with ministers or consuls as to\r\nwhether they should go or stay. On the one hand it may be\r\nurged that missionaries are under strong obligations to attach\r\ngreat weight to the judgment of their minister or consul. If\r\nthey receive the benefits and protection of citizenship, and if\r\nby their acts they may involve their governments, they should\r\nrecognize the right of the authorized representatives of those\r\ngovernments to counsel them. The presumption should be in\r\nfavour of obedience to that counsel, and it should not be disregarded\r\nwithout clear and strong reasons.\r\n\r\nBut the fact cannot be ignored that, whatever may be the\r\npersonal sympathies of individual ministers or consuls, diplomacy\r\nas such considers only the secondary results of missions,\r\nand not the primary ones. Government officials, speaking on\r\nmissionary work, almost invariably dwell on its material and\r\ncivilizing rather than its spiritual aspects. They do not, as\r\nofficials, feel that the salvation of men from sin and the command\r\nof Christ to evangelize all nations are within their sphere.\r\nMoreover, diplomacy is proverbially and necessarily cautious.\r\nIts business is to avoid risks, and, of course, to advise others to\r\navoid them. The political situation, too, was undeniably uncertain\r\nand delicate. The future was big with possibility of peril.\r\nIn such circumstances, we should expect diplomacy to be anxious\r\nand to look at the whole question from the prudential viewpoint.\r\n\r\nBut the missionary, like the soldier, must take some risks.\r\nFrom Paul down, missionaries have not hesitated to face them.\r\nChrist did not condition His great command upon the approval\r\nof Caesar. It was not safe for Morrison to enter China, and for\r\nmany years missionaries in the interior were in grave jeopardy.\r\nBut devoted men and women accepted the risk in the past, and\r\nthey will accept it in the future. They must exercise common\r\nsense. And yet this enterprise is unworldly as well as worldly,\r\nand when the soldier boldly faces every physical peril, when\r\nthe trader unflinchingly jeopardizes life and limb in the pursuit\r\nof gold--I found a German mining engineer and his wife living\r\nalone in a remote village soon after the Boxer excitement--\r\nshould the missionary be held back?\r\n\r\nIf, however, after full and careful deliberation, missionaries feel\r\nthat it is their duty to disregard the advice of their minister or\r\nconsul, they should consult their respective boards and if the\r\nboards sustain them, all concerned should accept responsibility\r\nfor the risks involved.\r\n\r\nBut if missionaries do not permit governments to control\r\ntheir movements, they should not be too exacting in their\r\ndemands on them when trouble comes. The Rev. Dr. Henry\r\nM. Field once said:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``A foreign missionary is one who goes to a strange country to preach\r\nthe gospel of our salvation. That is his errand and his defense. The\r\ncivil authorities are not presumed to be on his side. If he offends the\r\nsensibilities of the people to whom he preaches, he is supposed to face\r\nthe consequences. If he cannot win men by the Word and his own love\r\nfor their souls, he cannot call on the civil or military powers to convert\r\nthem. Nor is the missionary a merchant, in the sense that he must have\r\nready recourse to the courts for a recouping of losses or the recovery of\r\ndamages. Commercial treaties cannot cover all our missionary enterprises.\r\nConfusion of ideas here has confounded a good many fine plans\r\nand zealous men. It is a tremendous begging of the whole question to\r\ninsist on the nation's protection of the men who are to subvert the\r\nnational faith. Property rights and preaching rights get closely entwined,\r\nand it is difficult to untangle them at times, but the distinction\r\nis definite and the difference often fundamental. By confusing\r\nthem we weaken the claims of both. And when our Christian preachers\r\nget behind a mere property right in order to defend their right to preach\r\na new religion, they dishonour themselves and defame the faith they\r\nprofess. To get behind diplomatic guaranties in order to evangelize the\r\nnations is to mistake the sword for the Spirit, to rely on the arm of flesh\r\nand put aside the help of the Almighty.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is, in my judgment, stating the case rather strongly.\r\nDoubtless Dr. Field did not mean that governments would be\r\njustified in discriminating against missionaries and he would\r\nprobably have been one of the first to protest if they had done\r\nso. He was addressing missionaries, reminding them that they\r\ncould do in liberty what the governments could not do in law,\r\nand exhorting against any disposition to depend unduly upon\r\nthe sword of the secular arm. At any rate, he was a devoted\r\nfriend of missions and as such his words are deserving of\r\nthoughtful consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nRESPONSIBILITY OF MISSIONARIES FOR THE\r\nBOXER UPRISING\r\n\r\nCRITICS vociferously assert that the missionaries were\r\nchiefly responsible for the Boxer uprising and for most\r\nof the prejudice of the Chinese against foreigners. As\r\nto the general accuracy of this charge, the reader has doubtless\r\nformed some impression from what has been said in the preceding\r\nchapters regarding the objects and methods of foreign\r\ntrade and foreign politics. Still, it is but fair to remember that\r\nthere are 3,854 missionaries in China, representing almost every\r\nEuropean and American nationality and no less than nine\r\nRoman Catholic and sixty-seven Protestant boards.[72] As might\r\nbe expected, the standard of appointment varies. A few\r\nboards, while insisting upon high spiritual qualifications, do\r\nnot insist upon equal qualifications of some other kinds, while\r\nin all societies an occasional missionary proves to be visionary\r\nand ill-balanced. But in the great majority of the boards,\r\nthe standard of appointment is very high, and while occasional\r\nmistakes are made, yet as a rule the missionaries represent the\r\nbest type of Protestant Christianity. They are, as a class,\r\nmen and women of education, refinement and ability--in every\r\nrespect the equals and as a rule the superiors of the best class\r\nof non-missionary Europeans and Americans in China.\r\n\r\n\r\n[72] The Chinese Recorder.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow it is manifest that criticisms which may be true of some\r\nmissionaries may not be true of the missionary body as a\r\nwhole. As a matter of fact, the average critic has in mind\r\neither the Roman Catholic priests or the members of some\r\nindependent society. This is notably true of Michie. Many\r\nof the charges are not true even of them, but of the charges\r\nthat I have seen that have any foundation at all, nine-tenths\r\ndo not apply to the missionaries of church boards. It is always\r\nfair, therefore, to ask a critic, ``To which class of missionaries\r\ndo you refer?''\r\n\r\nThe clearest line of distinction is between the Protestants\r\nand the Roman Catholics. The latter number 904. They\r\nhave been in China the longest. They have the largest following,[73]\r\nand their methods are radically different from those of the\r\nProtestant missionaries. It is not denied that some of the\r\npriests are high-minded, intelligent men and that some of the\r\nProtestants lack wisdom. But comparing the two classes\r\nbroadly, no one who is at all conversant with the facts will regard\r\nthe Protestants as inferior. I do not wish to be unjust to\r\nthe Roman Catholic missionaries in China. Many good things\r\nmight be said regarding the work which some of them are doing.\r\nI personally called at several Roman Catholic stations in\r\nvarious parts of the Empire and I have vivid recollections of\r\nthe kindness with which I was received, while more than once\r\nI was impressed by the unmistakable evidences of devotion and\r\nself-sacrifice. It was pleasant to hear many Protestant missionaries\r\ndeclare that they had never heard a suspicion as to the\r\nmoral character of the priests. I did not hear any in all north\r\nChina. The lives of the Roman Catholic missionaries are hard\r\nand narrow and they have no relief in the companionships of\r\nwife and children, in furloughs or in medical attendance, for\r\nthey have no medical missionaries, while not infrequently the\r\npriest lives alone in a village. Dead to the world, with no\r\nfamilies and no expectation of returning to their native land,\r\ntrained from boyhood to a monastic life, drilled to unquestioning\r\nobedience and to few personal needs, their ambition is not\r\nto get anything for themselves but to strengthen the Church\r\nfor which the individual priest unhesitatingly sacrifices himself,\r\ncontent if by his complete submergence of his own interests he\r\nhas helped to make her great. With such men, Rome is a\r\nmighty power in Asia. But the sincere, devoted man may be\r\neven more dangerous if his zeal is wrongly directed, and the\r\nquestion under discussion now is not the personal character of\r\nindividuals, but the general policy of the Church. As to\r\nthe character and effects of this policy I found a remarkable\r\nunanimity of opinion in China, and I could easily produce\r\nfrom my note-books the names of scores of credible witnesses\r\nto the substantial accuracy of my position.\r\n\r\n\r\n[73] 720,540 Roman Catholics--compare p. 223 for Protestants.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said in favour of the Roman Catholics, it\r\nis unquestionable that their methods are far more irritating to\r\nthe Chinese than the methods of the Protestants. Led by able\r\nand energetic bishops, the priests acquire all possible business\r\nproperty, demand large rentals, build imposing religious plants,\r\nand baptize or enroll as catechumens all sorts of people. It is\r\nnotorious that the Roman Catholic priests quite generally\r\nadopt the policy of interference on behalf of their converts.\r\nThrough the Minister of France at Peking they obtained an\r\nImperial Edict, dated March 15, 1899, granting them official\r\nstatus, so that the local priest is on a footing of equality with\r\nthe local magistrate, and has the right of full access to him at\r\nany time. Whether or not intended by the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch, the impression is almost universal in China among\r\nnatives and foreigners alike that, if a Chinese becomes a\r\nCatholic, the Church will stand by him through thick and\r\nthin, in time and in eternity. There are, indeed, exceptions.\r\nDr. Johnson, of Ichou-fu, told me of a Roman Catholic Christian\r\nwho, during the Boxer troubles, stealthily moved his goods\r\ninto Ichou-fu, burned his house, and then put in a claim for\r\nindemnity. The heathen neighbours, when asked to pay, informed\r\nthe priest. He summoned the man, who confusedly\r\nsaid that if he had not burned the house, the Boxers would have\r\ndone so, and he thought he had better do it at a convenient\r\ntime as it was sure to be burned anyway. The priest promptly\r\ndecided that he must suffer the loss himself. So the priests do\r\nnot always stand by their converts whether right or wrong.\r\n\r\nNo one, however, who is familiar with the general course of\r\nthe Roman Catholic Church in China, will deny that, as a\r\nrule, the priests boldly champion the cause of their converts.\r\nThis is one secret of Rome's great and rapidly growing power\r\nin China, and unquestionably, too, it is one of the chief causes\r\nof Chinese hostility to missions. After many years of observation,\r\nDr. J. Campbell Gibson writes:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``In the missions of the Church of Rome, they (treaty rights) are\r\nsystematically, and I am afraid one must say unscrupulously, used for the\r\ngathering in of large numbers of nominal converts, whose only claim to\r\nthe Christian name is their registration in lists kept by native catechists,\r\nin which they are entered on payment of a small fee, without regard to\r\ntheir possession of any degree of Christian knowledge or character. In\r\nthe event of their being involved in any dispute or lawsuit, the native\r\ncatechists or priests, and even the foreign Roman Catholic missionaries,\r\ntake up their cause and press it upon the native magistrates. Not infrequently\r\na still worse course is pursued. Intimation is sent round the\r\nvillages in which there are large numbers of so-called Catholic converts\r\nand these assemble under arms to support by force the feuds of their\r\nco-religionists. The consequence is that the Catholic missions in southern\r\nChina, and I believe in the north also, are bitterly hated by the Chinese\r\npeople and by their magistrates. By terrorizing both magistrates and\r\npeople, they have secured in many places a large amount of apparent\r\npopularity; but they are sowing the seeds of a harvest of hatred and bitterness\r\nwhich may be reaped in deplorable forms in years to come.''[74]\r\n\r\n\r\n[74] ``Mission Problems and Mission Methods in South China,'' pp. 309,\r\n310.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my own interviews with Chinese officials, it was my custom\r\nto lead the conversation towards the motives of those who had\r\nattacked foreigners during the Boxer uprising, and without exception\r\nthe officials mentioned, among other causes, the interference\r\nof Roman Catholic priests with the administration of\r\nthe law in cases affecting their converts. In several places in\r\nthe interior, this was the only reason assigned.\r\n\r\nSaid an intelligent Chinese official in Shantung: ``The\r\nwhole trouble is not with the Protestants but with the Catholics.\r\nProtestant Christians do not go to law so often, and when they\r\ndo, the Protestant missionary does not, as a rule, interfere unless\r\nhe is sure they are right. But the Catholic Christians are\r\nconstantly involved in lawsuits, and the priests invariably stand\r\nby them right or wrong. The priests seem to think that their\r\nconverts cannot be wrong. The result is that many Chinese\r\njoin the Roman Catholic Church to get the help of the priests\r\nin the innumerable lawsuits that the Chinese are always waging.\r\nAnd it is not surprising in such circumstances that Catholic\r\nChristians are a bad lot.'' When I asked the magistrate of\r\nPaoting-fu why the people had killed such kindly and helpful\r\nneighbours as the Congregational and Presbyterian missionaries,\r\nhe replied:--``The people were angered by the interference\r\nof the Roman Catholics in their lawsuits. They felt\r\nthat they could not obtain justice against them, and in their\r\nfrenzy they did not distinguish between Catholics and Protestants.''\r\nThe Roman Catholic Mission in the prefecture of\r\nPaoting-fu, it should be remembered, is about two centuries\r\nold, and the Catholic population is about 12,000, so that the\r\nfew hundreds of converts who have been gathered in the recent\r\nwork of the Protestants are very small in comparison, while the\r\nsplendid cathedral of the Roman Church, the spectacular character\r\nof its services and the official status and aggressiveness\r\nof its priests intensify the disproportion. The term Christian,\r\ntherefore, to the average man of Paoting-fu naturally means a\r\nRoman Catholic rather than a Protestant.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should make some allowance for Oriental forms\r\nof statement to one who was known to be a Protestant. The\r\npoliteness of an Oriental host to a guest is not always limited\r\nby veracity, and it is possible that to Roman Catholics the\r\nofficials may blame the Protestants. But such unanimity of\r\ntestimony among so many independent and widely separated\r\nofficials must surely count for something, especially when the\r\ngrounds for it are so notorious. Undoubtedly, there are many\r\nsincere Christians among the Roman Catholic Chinese, but\r\njudging from the almost universal testimony that I heard in\r\nChina, the Roman Church is a veritable cave of Adullam for\r\nunscrupulous and revengeful Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe evidence does not rest upon the testimony of Protestants\r\nalone. If any one will take the trouble to look up the diplomatic\r\ncorrespondence on this subject, he will find ample and\r\nconvincing testimony. February 9, 1871, the Tsung-li Yamen\r\naddressed to the Foreign Legations at Peking a memorandum\r\ntogether with eight propositions, the whole embodying the\r\ncomplaints and objections of the Chinese Government to missionaries\r\nand their work in China, and suggesting certain regulations\r\nfor the future. This memorandum included the following\r\nparagraph:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``The missionary question affects the whole question of pacific relations\r\nwith foreign powers--the whole question of their trade. As the Minister\r\naddressed cannot but be well aware, wherever missionaries of the Romish\r\nprofession appear, ill-feeling begins between them and the people, and for\r\nyears past, in one case or another, points of all kinds on which they are\r\nat issue have been presenting themselves. In earlier times when the\r\nRomish missionaries first came to China, styled, as they were, `Si Ju,'\r\nthe Scholars of the West, their converts no doubt for the most part were\r\npersons of good character; but since the change of ratifications in 1860,\r\nthe converts have in general not been of a moral class. The result has\r\nbeen that the religion that professes to exhort men to virtue has come to\r\nbe lightly thought of; it is in consequence, unpopular, and its unpopularity\r\nis greatly increased by the conduct of the converts who, relying on the\r\ninfluence of the missionaries, oppress and take advantage of the common\r\npeople (the non-Christians): and yet more by the conduct of the missionaries\r\nthemselves, who, when collisions between Christians and the people\r\noccur, and the authorities are engaged in dealing with them, take part\r\nwith the Christians, and uphold them in their opposition to the authorities.\r\nThis undiscriminating enlistment of proselytes has gone so far that\r\nrebels and criminals of China, pettifoggers and mischief-makers, and such\r\nlike, take refuge in the profession of Christianity, and covered by this\r\nposition, create disorder. This has deeply dissatisfied the people, and\r\ntheir dissatisfaction long felt grows into animosity, and their animosity\r\ninto deadly hostility. The populations of different localities are not aware\r\nthat Protestantism and Romanism are distinct. They include both under\r\nthe latter denomination. They do not know that there is any distinction\r\nbetween the nations of the West. They include them all under one denomination\r\nof foreigners, and thus any serious collision that occurs equally\r\ncompromises all foreigners in China. Even in the provinces not concerned,\r\ndoubt and misgiving are certain to be largely generated.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThe memorandum and its attached propositions are interesting\r\nreading as showing the impression which the Chinese Government\r\nhad of Roman Catholic missionary work. The third\r\nproposition included the following statement:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``They (Roman Catholic converts) even go so far as to coerce the authorities\r\nand cheat and oppress the people. And the foreign missionaries,\r\nwithout inquiring into facts, conceal in every case the Christian evil-doer,\r\nand refuse to surrender him to the authorities for punishment. It has\r\neven occurred that malefactors who have been guilty of the gravest\r\ncrimes have thrown themselves into the profession of Christianity, and\r\nhave been at once accepted and screened (from justice). In every province\r\ndo the foreign missionaries interfere at the offices of the local authorities\r\nin lawsuits in which native Christians are concerned. For example\r\nin a case that occurred in Sze-chuen in which some native Christian\r\nwomen defrauded certain persons (non-Christians) of the rent owing to\r\nthem, and actually had these persons wounded and killed, the French\r\nBishop took on himself to write in official form (to the authorities) pleading\r\nin their favour. None of these women were sentenced to forfeit life\r\nfor life taken, and the resentment of the people of Sze-chuen in consequence\r\nremains unabated.''\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Wade, the British Minister at Peking, in reporting this\r\nmemorandum and its appended propositions to Earl Granville,\r\nJune 8, 1871, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n``The promiscuous enlistment of evil men as well as good by the\r\nRomish missionaries, and their advocacy of the claims advanced by these\r\nill-conditioned converts, has made Romanism most unpopular; and the\r\npeople at large do not distinguish between Romanist and Protestant, nor\r\nbetween foreigner and foreigner; not that Government has made no effort\r\nto instruct the people, but China is a large Empire.... Three-\r\nfourths of the Romish missionaries in China, in all, between 400 and 500\r\npersons, are French; and Romanism in the mouths of non-Christian\r\nChinese is as popularly termed the religion of the French as the religion\r\nof the Lord of Heaven.''\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 27th of that year, Earl Granville wrote to Lord Lyons\r\nthat he had said to the French Charge d'Affaires:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``I told M. Gavard that I could not pretend to think that the conduct\r\nof the French missionaries, stimulated by the highest and most laudable\r\nobject, had been prudent in the interest of Christianity itself, and that the\r\nsupport which had been given by the representatives of France to their\r\npretensions was dangerous to the future relations of Europe with China.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Frederick F. Low, United States Minister at\r\nPeking, in communicating that memorandum and the attached\r\npropositions to the State Department in Washington, March\r\n20, 1871, said:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``A careful reading of the Memorandum clearly proves that the great,\r\nif not only, cause of complaint against the missionaries comes from the\r\naction of the Roman Catholic priests and the native Christians of that\r\nfaith.... Had they (the Chinese Goverment) stated their complaints\r\nin brief, without circumlocution, and stripped of all useless verbiage,\r\nthey would have charged that the Roman Catholic missionaries,\r\nwhen residing away from the open ports, claim to occupy a semi-official\r\nposition, which places them on an equality with the provincial officer;\r\nthat they deny the authority of the Chinese officials over native Christians,\r\nwhich practically removes this class from the jurisdiction of their own\r\nrulers; that their action in this regard shields the native Christians from\r\nthe penalties of the law, and thus holds out inducements for the lawless\r\nto join the Catholic Church, which is largely taken advantage of; that\r\norphan asylums are filled with children, by the use of improper means,\r\nagainst the will of the people; and when parents, guardians, and friends\r\nvisit these institutions for the purpose of reclaiming children, their requests\r\nfor examination and restitution are denied, and lastly, that the French\r\nGovernment, while it does not claim for its missionaries any rights of this\r\nnature by virtue of treaty, its agents and representatives wink at these\r\nunlawful acts, and secretly uphold the missionaries. . . . I do not\r\nbelieve, and, therefore I cannot affirm, that all the complaints made\r\nagainst Catholic missionaries are founded in truth, reason, or justice; at\r\nthe same time, I believe that there is foundation for some of their charges.\r\nMy opinions, as expressed in former despatches touching this matter, are\r\nconfirmed by further investigation. . . .''\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the same date, Minister Low wrote to the Tsung-li\r\nYamen:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``It is a noticeable fact, that among all the cases cited there does not\r\nappear to be one in which Protestant missionaries are charged with violating\r\ntreaty, law or custom. So far as I can ascertain, your complaints\r\nare chiefly against the action and attitude of the missionaries of the\r\nRoman Catholic faith; and, as these are under the exclusive protection\r\nand control of the Government of France, I might with great propriety\r\ndecline to discuss a matter with which the Government of the United\r\nStates has no direct interest or concern, for the reason that none of its\r\ncitizens are charged with violating treaty or local law, and thus causing\r\ntrouble.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tendency of the Chinese to confuse Roman Catholics\r\nand Protestants is further illustrated by the note addressed by\r\nMinister Wen Hsiang to Sir R. Alcock:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``Extreme indeed would be the danger if, popular indignation having\r\nbeen once aroused by this opposition to the authorities, the hatred of the\r\nwhole population of China were excited like that of the people of Tientsin\r\nagainst foreigners, and orders, though issued by the Government,\r\ncould not be for all that put in force. . . . Although the creeds of the\r\nvarious foreign countries differ in their origin and development from each\r\nother, the natives of China are unable to see the distinction between\r\nthem. In their eyes all (teachers of religion) are `missionaries from the\r\nWest,' and directly they hear a lying story (about any of these missionaries),\r\nwithout making further and minute inquiry (into its truth), they\r\nrise in a body to molest him.''\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for Protestant missionaries, it would be useless to assert\r\nthat every one of the 2,950 has always been blameless in\r\nthis matter. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that there is\r\na sense in which the gospel is a revolutionary force. Christ\r\nHimself said that He came not to send peace on earth but a\r\nsword, and to set a man at variance against his father. There\r\nis usually more or less of a protest in a heathen land when a\r\nman turns from the old faith to the new one. The refusal to\r\ncontribute to the temple sacrifices and to worship the ancestral\r\ntablets is sure to be followed by a furious outcry. The convert\r\nis apt to be assailed as a traitor to the national custom and\r\nas having entered into league with the foreigner.\r\n\r\nTo the Chinese, moreover, all white men are ``Christians''\r\nand ``foreign devils,'' and all alike stand for the effort to foreignize\r\nand despoil China. Except where personal acquaintance\r\nhas taught certain communities that there is a difference\r\nbetween white men, the evil acts of one foreigner or of one aggressive\r\nforeign Government are charged against all the members\r\nof the race, just as in the pioneer days in the American\r\ncolonies, a settler whose wife had been killed by an Indian took\r\nhis revenge by indiscriminately shooting all the other Indians\r\nhe could find. Any hatred that the Chinese may have against\r\nChristianity is due, not so much to its religious teachings, as to\r\nits identification with the foreign nations whose religion\r\nChristianity is supposed to be and whose aggressions the Chinese\r\nhave so much reason to fear and to hate.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, the introduction of Buddhism and Mohammedanism\r\nis not parallel, and to base an argument against\r\nChristianity on the alleged fact that the other faiths easily succeeded\r\nin domesticating themselves in China is to confuse facts.\r\nNeither Buddhism nor Mohammedanism entered China as an\r\naggressive propaganda by foreigners. The Chinese themselves\r\nbrought in Buddhism, and it spread chiefly because it grafted\r\ninto itself many Chinese superstitions and did not oppose\r\nChinese vices, but rather assimilated them. Why should the\r\npeople have opposed a religion which interfered with nothing\r\nthat they valued and reenforced their darling prejudices? As\r\nfor Islam, we have already seen[75] that it is the faith of early immigrants\r\nand their descendants, that its followers do not propagate\r\nit, that they live in separate communities, are disliked by\r\nthe Chinese and are often at open war with them. Christianity,\r\non the contrary, comes to China with foreigners who\r\nhave no intention of settling down as permanent members of\r\nChinese society, who are classed as representatives of nations\r\nwhich are regarded as more or less hostile and unjust, and who\r\npreach their religion as a vital spiritual faith which opposes all\r\nwrong, uproots all superstition and aims at the moral reconstruction\r\nof every man. Of course, therefore, Christianity must expect\r\na reception different in some respects from that which was\r\ngiven to Buddhism and Mohammedanism.\r\n\r\n\r\n[75] Chapter VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the shallowest of all objections to missions that\r\nMr. Francis Nichols urged in the North American Review\r\nwhen he insisted that ``the missionary is not engaged to be a\r\nreformer,'' but that ``his mission is to preach the gospel--\r\nnothing more.''\r\n\r\n\r\n``Is the gospel then simply a patent arrangement by which idolaters\r\ncan get to heaven, without disturbing their idolatry or the vices associated\r\nwith it? was not Christ a reformer? and Paul also, and his successors,\r\nwho, by their preaching, gave the idols of Rome to the moles and the\r\nbats, and robbed the Coliseum of its gladiatorial shows? It is the glory\r\nof Christianity that on questions of truth and righteousness it makes no\r\ncompromise. Its mission is to save the world by reforming it....\r\nWho that understands the genius of Christianity can fail to see that China\r\nChristianized must be very different from China as it now is?''[76]\r\n\r\n\r\n[76] The Rev. Dr. Calvin Mateer, Teng chou.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter making all due allowance for these things, however,\r\nthe fact still remains that opposition of this sort in\r\nChina is usually local and sporadic. It affects a greater\r\nor less number of individuals and families and occasionally\r\na community, but it does not move a whole population to\r\nthe frenzy of a national uprising. The anti-foreign hatred\r\nof the Boxers was fierce in thousands of cities and villages\r\nwhere there were no missionaries or Chinese Christians at\r\nall. In the sphere of religion proper, the Chinese are not an\r\nintolerant people. They are almost wholly devoid of sec-\r\ntarian spirit. The coming of another religion would not of\r\nitself excite serious opposition, for having become accustomed\r\nto the presence and intermingling of several religions, it would\r\nnot antecedently occur to the Chinese that a fourth faith would\r\ninvolve the abandonment of the others. They would be more\r\napt to infer that the new could be accepted in harmony with\r\nthe old in the established way. So the worst foe that the\r\nChristian missionary has to encounter is not hostility but indifference.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the Chinese have not strenuously objected to the\r\nProtestant missionaries as missionaries. It is the policy of the\r\nmission boards to avoid all unnecessary interference with native\r\ncustoms. So far from coveting official equality with Chinese\r\nmagistrates, an overwhelming majority of the Protestant missionaries\r\nthroughout the Empire expressly declined to avail\r\nthemselves of the offer of the Chinese Government to give them\r\nthe same privileges and official status that was accorded to the\r\nRoman Catholic priests and bishops in the Imperial decree of\r\nMarch 15, 1899.\r\n\r\n``The very thing which missionaries seek to avoid is\r\ndenationalizing their converts. So far as mission schools at the\r\nports are concerned, it is not the missionary who is chiefly\r\nresponsible for what foreignizing is done. The Chinese who\r\npatronize these schools want their children to learn foreign\r\naccomplishments. Such schools, however, form but a very small\r\npart of the extensive educational work done by American\r\nmissionaries in China.''[77]\r\n\r\n\r\n[77] The Rev. Dr. Calvin H. Mateer.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the missionaries, especially in the interior stations,\r\ndon Chinese clothing, shave their heads and wear a queue.\r\nEverywhere the missionaries learn the Chinese language, try to\r\nget into sympathy with the people, teach the young, heal the sick,\r\ncomfort the dying, distribute relief in time of famine, preach the\r\ngospel of peace and good-will, and, in the opinion of unprejudiced\r\njudges, are upright, sensible and useful workers. Not\r\nonly men but women travel far into the interior, the former\r\nfrequently alone and unarmed. They go into the homes of the\r\npeople, preach in village streets, sleep unprotected in Chinese\r\nhouses, and receive much personal kindness from all classes.\r\n\r\nThe experience of the Presbyterian mission at Chining-chou\r\nis an illustration of what has occurred in scores of communities.\r\nWhen Dr. Stephen A. Hunter and the Rev. William Lane tried\r\nto open a station in 1890, they were mobbed and driven out,\r\nbarely escaping with their lives. But in June, 1892, the Rev.\r\nJ. A. Laughlin arrived and was permitted to buy property and,\r\nin September, to bring his family and begin permanent residence.\r\nThere are hereditary bands of robbers in the neighbourhood,\r\nand more than once they attacked the mission compound.\r\nBut gradually the peaceful purpose and the beneficent\r\nlife of the missionaries became known and active opposition\r\nceased. When the Boxer outbreak occurred, there were about\r\n150 baptized adults, besides a considerable number of children\r\nand adherents. During the troubles, only two of the Christians\r\nrecanted, the rest holding together and continuing regular services.\r\nThe mission property was undisturbed during the\r\nwhole period. It is true, the officials were friendly; but even\r\nGovernor Yuan Shih Kai's influence could not prevent some\r\nloss in his own capital. In Chining-chou not a thing was\r\ntouched, a striking testimony to the friendliness of the people\r\ntowards the missionaries whom they had learned to love. As\r\nI approached the city with the returning missionaries, a group\r\nof thirty met us with beaming faces. For nearly a year, they\r\nhad been without a missionary and their joy at seeing Mr.\r\nLaughlin was unmistakable. As we passed through the city to\r\nthe mission-compound in the southeast suburb, people in almost\r\nevery door and window smiled and bowed a welcome.\r\nNor was this cordiality confined to the Christians; many of all\r\nclasses being outspoken in their manifestations of respect and\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nNor is it true that the Chinese sense of propriety is so out-\r\nraged, as some critics would have us believe, by the coming of\r\nsingle-women missionaries. It is true that in a land where all\r\nwomen are supposed to marry at an early age and where their\r\nfreedom of movement is rigidly circumscribed, the position of\r\nthe unmarried woman, however discreet she may be, is sometimes\r\nembarrassingly misunderstood until the community becomes\r\nbetter acquainted with her mission and character. But\r\nthe opposition of the Chinese on this account has been grossly\r\nexaggerated by those whose prior hostility to all missionary\r\nwork predisposed them to make as much capital as possible out\r\nof the small gossip on this subject. Even if the misunderstanding\r\nwere as general and as bitter as some allege, it would not\r\nfollow that single women should be withdrawn, for such misunderstanding\r\ngrows out of a false and vicious conception of\r\nthe female sex and its relation to man and society, and it is\r\njust that conception which Christianity should and does correct.\r\nFor that matter, the position of the single man is also\r\nmisunderstood, while no other person in all China is more\r\nfiercely hated by the Chinese than the white traders in the\r\ntreaty ports who are the chief source of the criticisms upon\r\nmissionaries. The experience of every mission board operating\r\nin China has shown that a Chinese town soon learns that the\r\nsingle-woman missionary is a pure-minded, large-hearted and\r\nunselfish worker, who from the loftiest of motives devotes herself\r\nto the teaching of women and children and to self-sacrificing\r\nministries to the sick and suffering. No other foreigners\r\nare more beloved by the people than the single-women missionaries.\r\n\r\nIt is simply foolish to say that the missionary is responsible\r\nfor the prompt appearance of the consul and the gunboat.\r\nThe true missionary goes forth without either consul or gunboat.\r\nHe devotes his life to ameliorating the sad conditions\r\nwhich prevail in heathen communities. His reliance is not\r\nupon man, but upon God. But as soon as his work begins to\r\ntell, the trader appears to buy and sell in the new market.\r\nThe statesman casts covetous eyes on the newly opened territory.\r\nChristianity civilizes, and civilization increases wants,\r\nstimulates trade and breaks down barriers. The conditions of\r\nmodern civilization are developed. Then the consul is sent,\r\nnot because the missionary asks for him, but because his\r\ngovernment chooses to send him. Sooner or later some local\r\ntrouble occurs, and the Government takes advantage of the opportunity\r\nto further its territorial or commercial ambitions.\r\n``Missionaries responsible, indeed!'' writes Dr. H. H. Jessup.\r\n``The diplomats of Europe know better. Had there been no\r\ngrabbing of seaports and hinterlands, no forcing modern improvements\r\nand European goods down the throats of the Chinese,\r\nthe missionaries would have been let alone now as in the\r\npast.''\r\n\r\nIt is the foreign idea that the Chinese dislikes, the interference\r\nwith his cherished customs and traditions. A railroad\r\nalarms and angers him more than half a hundred missionaries.\r\nA plowshare cuts through more of his superstitions than a mission\r\nschool. He does not want the methods of our western\r\ncivilization, and he resents the attempt to push them upon him.\r\nIf no other force had been at work than the foreign missionary,\r\nthe anti-foreign agitation would never have started. It is significant\r\nthat those who protest that we ought not to force our religion\r\nupon the Chinese do not appear to think that there is\r\nanything objectionable in forcing our trade upon them. The\r\nanimosity of the Chinese has been primarily excited, not by the\r\nmissionary, but by the trader and the politician, and the missionary\r\nsuffers chiefly because he comes from the country of\r\nthe trader and the politician and is identified with them as a\r\nmember of the hated race of foreigners.\r\n\r\nOn this whole subject, I have been at some pains to collect\r\nthe testimony of men whose positions are a guarantee not only\r\nof knowledge but of impartiality.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. George F. Seward, formerly United States\r\nMinister to Chipa, declares:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``The people at large make too much of missionary work as an occasion\r\nfor trouble. There are missionaries who are iconoclasts, but this is not\r\ntheir spirit. In great measure, they are men of education and judgment.\r\nThey depend upon spiritual weapons and good works. For every enemy\r\na missionary makes, he makes fifty friends. The one enemy may arouse\r\nan ignorant rabble to attack him. While I was in China, I always\r\ncongratulated myself on the fact that the missionaries were there. There\r\nwere good men and able men among the merchants and officials, but it\r\nwas the missionary who exhibited the foreigner in benevolent work as\r\nhaving other aims than those which may justly be called selfish. The\r\ngood done by missionaries in the way of education, of medical relief and\r\nof other charities cannot be overstated. If in China there were none\r\nother than missionary influences, the upbuilding of that great people\r\nwould go forward securely. . . . I am not a church member, but I\r\nhave the profoundest admiration for the missionary as I have known him\r\nin China. He is a power for good and for peace, not for evil.''\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident James B. Angell, also formerly United States\r\nMinister to China, replies as follows to the question, ``Are\r\nthe Chinese averse to the introduction of the Christian\r\nreligion'':--\r\n\r\n\r\n``No, not in that broad sense. They do not seem to fear for the permanency\r\nof their own religion. It is not that they object to missionaries\r\nand the Christian religion as much as it is that the missionaries are\r\nforeigners. A more serious cause of the uprising is the wide-spread\r\nsuspicion among the natives, since the Japanese war, that the foreigners\r\nare going to partition China. It is not strange that all these conditions\r\ncause friction and excitement. The Chinese want to be left to themselves\r\nand the one word `foreigners' sums up the great cause of the present\r\ntrouble.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Charles Denby, after thirteen years' experience as\r\nUnited States Minister to China, wrote:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``I unqualifiedly, and in the strongest language that tongue can\r\nutter, give to these men and women who are living and dying in China\r\nand the Far East my full and unadulterated commendation. . . . No\r\none can controvert the fact that the Chinese are enormously benefited by\r\nthe labours of the missionaries. Foreign hospitals are a great boon to the\r\nsick. In the matter of education, the movement is immense. There are\r\nschools and colleges all over China taught by the missionaries. There are\r\nalso many foreign asylums in various cities which take care of thousands\r\nof waifs. The missionaries translate into Chinese many scientific and\r\nphilosophical works. There are various anti-opium hospitals where the\r\nvictims of this vice are cured. There are industrial schools and workshops.\r\nThere are many native Christian churches. The converts seem to be as\r\ndevout as people of any other race. As far as my knowledge extends, I\r\ncan and do say that the missionaries in China are self-sacrificing; that\r\ntheir lives are pure; that they are devoted to their work; that their\r\ninfluence is beneficial to the natives; that the arts and sciences and\r\ncivilization are greatly spread by their efforts; that many useful western\r\nbooks are translated by them into Chinese; that they are the leaders in all\r\ncharitable work, giving largely themselves and personally disbursing the\r\nfunds with which they are intrusted; that they do make converts, and\r\nsuch converts are mentally benefited by conversion.'' And after the\r\nBoxer outbreak he added:--``I do not believe that the uprising in China\r\nwas due to hatred of the missionaries or of the Christian religion. The\r\nChinese are a philosophic people, and rarely act without reasoning upon\r\nthe causes and results of their actions. They have seen their land disappearing\r\nand becoming the property of foreigners, and it was this that\r\nawakened hatred of foreigners and not the actions of the missionaries or\r\nthe doctrines that they teach.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present United States Minister, the Hon. Edwin H.\r\nConger, has repeatedly borne similar testimony, publicly\r\nassuring the missionaries of his ``personal respect and profound\r\ngratitude for their noble conduct.''\r\n\r\nThe Hon. John W. Foster, ex-Secretary of State and\r\ncounsel for the Chinese Government in the settlement with\r\nJapan, writes:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``The opinion formed by me after careful inquiry and observation is\r\nthat the mass of the population of China, particularly the common people,\r\nare not specially hostile to the missionaries and their work. Occasional\r\nriots have occurred, but they are almost invariably traced to the literati or\r\nprospective office-holders and the ruling classes. These are often bigoted\r\nand conceited to the highest degree, and regard the teachings of the\r\nmissionaries as tending to overthrow the existing order of Government and\r\nsociety, which they look upon as a perfect system, and sanctified by great\r\nantiquity. . . . The Chinese, as a class, are not fanatics in religion\r\nand if other causes had not operated to awaken a national hostility to\r\nforeigners, the missionaries would have been left free to combat\r\nBuddhism and Taoism, and carry on their work of establishing schools\r\nand hospitals.''\r\n\r\n\r\nWu Ting-fang, Chinese Minister to Washington during the\r\nBoxer uprising, while frankly stating that ``missionaries are\r\nplaced in a very delicate situation,'' and that ``we must not\r\nbe blind to the fact that some, in their excessive zeal, have\r\nbeen indiscreet,'' nevertheless as frankly added:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``It has been commonly supposed that missionaries are the sole cause\r\nof anti-foreign feeling in China. This charge is unfair. Missionaries\r\nhave done a great deal of good in China. They have translated useful\r\nworks into the Chinese language, published scientific and educational\r\njournals and established schools in the country. Medical missionaries\r\nespecially have been remarkably successful in their philanthropic work.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Benjamin Harrison, late President of the United\r\nStates, replied to my inquiry in the terse remark:--``If what\r\nLord Salisbury says were true, the reflection would not be upon\r\nthe missionaries, but upon the premiers.''\r\n\r\nGeneral James H. Wilson, of the United States Army, the\r\nsecond in command of the American forces in Peking, adds\r\nhis testimony:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``Our missionaries, after the earlier Jesuits, were almost the first in\r\nthat wide field (China). They were generally men of great piety and\r\nlearning, like Morrison, Brown, Martin and Williams, and did all in their\r\npower as genuine men of God to show the heathen that the stranger was\r\nnot necessarily a public enemy, but might be an evangel of a higher and\r\nbetter civilization. These men and their co-labourers have established\r\nhospitals, schools and colleges in various cities and provinces of the\r\nEmpire, which are everywhere recognized by intelligent Chinamen as\r\ncentres of unmitigated blessing to the people. Millions of dollars have\r\nbeen spent in this beneficent work, and the result is slowly but surely\r\nspreading the conviction that foreign arts and sciences are superior to\r\n`fung shuy' and native superstition.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hon. John Goodnow, American Consul-General at\r\nShanghai, emphatically declares:--``It is absurd to charge\r\nthe missionaries with causing the Boxer War. They are\r\nsimply hated by the Chinese as one part of a great foreign element\r\nthat threatened to upset the national institutions.''\r\n\r\nViceroy Yuan Shih Kai when Governor of Shantung, in the\r\nspring of 1901, wrote to the Baptist and Presbyterian\r\nmissionaries of the province as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n``You, reverend sirs, have been preaching in China for many years,\r\nand, without exception, exhort men concerning righteousness. Your\r\nchurch customs are strict and correct, and all your converts may well\r\nobserve them. In establishing your customs you have been careful to see\r\nthat Chinese law was observed. How, then, can it be said that there is\r\ndisloyalty? To meet this sort of calumny, I have instructed that\r\nproclamations be put out. I purpose, hereafter, to have lasting peace.\r\nChurch interests may then prosper and your idea of preaching\r\nrighteousness I can promote. The present upheaval is of a most\r\nextraordinary character. It forced you, reverend sirs, by land and water to\r\ngo long journeys, and subjected you to alarm and danger, causing me\r\nmany qualms of conscience.''\r\n\r\n\r\nA charge which has been so completely demolished by such\r\ncompetent and unprejudiced witnesses can only be renewed at\r\nthe expense of either intelligence or candour. Dr. Arthur H.\r\nSmith truly says that ``amid the varied action of so many\r\nagents it is vain to deny that Christianity has sometimes been so\r\npresented as to be misrepresented, but on the whole there had\r\nfor some time been a marked and a growing friendliness on the\r\npart of both people and officials. . . . The convulsion which\r\nshook China to its foundations was due to general causes, slow\r\nin their operations, but inevitable in their results. It was the\r\nimpact of the Middle Ages with the developed Christian commercial\r\ncivilization of the nineteenth century, albeit accompanied\r\nwith many incidental elements which were neither Christian\r\nnor in the true sense civilized. If Christianity had never come\r\nto China at all, some such collision must have occurred.''[78]\r\n\r\n\r\n[78] ``Rex Christus,'' pp. 204-206.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nTHE CHINESE CHRISTIANS\r\n\r\nTHE real effect of the operation of the missionary\r\nforce is to be seen in the Chinese who have accepted\r\nChristianity. As the commercial force is causing an\r\neconomic revolution and as the political force resulted in the\r\nBoxer uprising, so the missionary force is developing a great\r\nspiritual movement which is crystallizing into a Chinese Church.\r\nMuch has been said about the character of the Chinese Christians\r\nand doubts have been cast on the genuineness of their faith.\r\nIt is admitted that they sometimes try the patience of the missionary.\r\nBut is the home pastor never distressed by the conduct\r\nof his members? I am inclined to believe that the Christians in\r\nChina would compare favourably with the same number selected\r\nat random in America. A Chinese laundryman posted on his\r\ndoor this significant notice to his foreign customers:--``Please\r\nhelp us to remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy by bringing\r\nyour clothes to the laundry before ten o'clock on Saturdays,''\r\nwhile in another place a Chinese servant left the morning\r\nafter a card party at which much money had changed\r\nhands, stating to his mistress in explanation, ``Me Clistian;\r\nme no stay in heathen house!'' The Chinese Christian does\r\nnot content himself with church attendance once a week when\r\nthe weather is pleasant or an attractive theme is announced.\r\nHe does not find himself in vigorous health for an evening entertainment,\r\nand with a bad headache on prayer-meeting night.\r\nThere are of course exceptions, but as a rule, the Chinese\r\nChristians worship God with regularity in all kinds of weather.\r\nA missionary told me that the attendance at his mid-week\r\nmeeting was as large as at his Sunday morning service, that\r\nevery member of his church asked a blessing at the table, had\r\nfamily prayers and tried to bring his unconverted friends to\r\nChrist. If there is a pastor in America who can say that of his\r\npeople, he has modestly refrained from making it public.\r\n\r\nBut such comparisons are, after all, unfair to the Chinese\r\nChristian for he should be compared, not with Europeans and\r\nAmericans who have had far greater advantages, but with the\r\npeople of his own country. ``At home, you have the ripe\r\nfruits of a Christianity which was planted more than a thousand\r\nyears ago. The Word of God has been among you all\r\nthese Christian centuries. You have in every part of the\r\ncountry a highly trained ministry, a gifted and devoted eldership,\r\nand a whole army of Christian workers of all ranks. You\r\nwork in the atmosphere of a Christian society, and under a\r\nsettled Christian government. You have an immense and\r\nvaried Christian literature, and notwithstanding all defects and\r\ndrawbacks, you have on your side a weight of Christian tradition\r\nand a wealth of Christian example. Under such circumstances\r\nand in such an atmosphere, what are we not entitled to\r\nexpect of those who bear the Christian name? What justice is\r\nthere, or what reasonableness, in demanding as a test of genuineness\r\nthe same degree of attainment on the part of Christian\r\npeople, many of them uneducated, who are only just emerging\r\nfrom the deadness and insensibility of heathenism?''[79]\r\n\r\n\r\n[79] Gibson, pp. 239, 240.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe real question is this:--Is the Christian Chinese a better\r\nman than the non-Christian Chinese--more moral, more truthful,\r\nmore just, more reliable? The answer is so patent that no\r\none who knows the facts can doubt it for a moment. The best\r\nmen and women in China to-day are the Protestant Christians.\r\nThis is not saying that all converts are good or that all non-\r\nChristian Chinese are bad. But it is saying that comparing\r\nthe average Christian with the average heathen, the superiority\r\nof the former in those things which make character and conduct\r\nis immeasurable. ``The conscience of those who have been\r\nborn into a new life is not suddenly transformed, yet the change\r\ndoes take place and upon a larger scale. When once it has\r\nbeen accomplished, a new force has been introduced into the\r\nChinese Empire, a salt to preserve, a leaven to pervade, a seed\r\nto bring forth after its kind in perpetually augmenting abundance\r\nand fertility.''[80]\r\n\r\n\r\n[80] Smith, ``Rex Christus,'' p. 107.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe character of the Chinese Christian will appear in still\r\nmore striking relief if we consider the circumstances in which\r\nhe hears the gospel and the difficulties which he has to overcome.\r\nOn this subject the following remarkable passage from\r\nDr. Gibson is worth quoting entire:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``Out there the great issue is tried with all external helps removed.\r\nThe gospel goes to China with no subsidiary aids. It is spoken to the\r\npeople by the stammering lips of aliens. Those who accept it do so with\r\nno prospect of temporal gain. They go counter to all their own preconceptions,\r\nand to all the prejudices of their people. Try as we may to become\r\nall things to all men, we can but little accommodate our teaching to\r\ntheir thought. . . . Often and often have I looked into the faces of a crowd\r\nof non-Christian Chinese and felt keenly how many barriers lay between\r\ntheir minds and mine. Reasoning that seems to me conclusive makes no\r\nappeal to them. Even the words we use to convey religious ideas do not\r\nbear to their minds one-hundredth part of the meaning we wish to put into\r\nthem. I have often thought that if I were to expend all my energies to\r\npersuade one Chinaman to change the cut of his coat, or to try some new\r\nexperiment in agriculture, I should certainly plead in vain. And yet I\r\nstand up to beg him to change the habits of a lifetime, to break away\r\nfrom the whole accumulated outcome of heredity, to make himself a target\r\nfor the scorn of the world in which he lives, to break off from the consolidated\r\nsocial system which has shaped his being, and on the bare word of\r\nan unknown stranger to plunge into the hazardous experiment of a new\r\nand untried life, to be lived on a moral plane still almost inconceivable to\r\nhim, whose sanctions and rewards are higher than his thoughts as heaven\r\nis higher than earth. While I despair of inducing him by my reasonings\r\nto make the smallest change in the least of his habits, I ask him, not with\r\na light heart, but with a hopeful one, to submit his whole being to a change\r\nthat is for him the making of his whole world anew. `Credo quia impossis-\r\nble,' I believe it can be done because I know I cannot do it, and the smallest\r\nsuccess is proof of the working of the divine power. The missionary must\r\neither confess himself helpless, or he must to the last fibre of his being believe\r\nin the Holy Ghost. I choose to believe, nay I am shut up to believe,\r\nby what my eyes have seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n``I do not mean that one sees the results of preaching directly on the\r\nspot. In China at least one seldom does. But by the power of God the\r\nresults come. We have seen unclean lives made pure, the broken-hearted\r\nmade glad, the false and crooked made upright and true, the harsh and\r\ncruel made kindly and gentle. I have seen old women, seventy, eighty,\r\neighty-five years of age, throwing away the superstitions of a lifetime, the\r\naccumulated merit of years of toilsome and expensive worship, and when\r\nalmost on the brink of the grave, venturing all upon a new-preached faith\r\nand a new-found Saviour. We have seen the abandoned gambler become\r\na faithful and zealous preacher of the gospel. We have seen the poor\r\ngiving out of their poverty help to others, poorer still. We see many\r\nChinese Christians who were once narrow and avaricious, giving out of\r\ntheir hard-earned month's wages, or more, yearly, to help the church's\r\nwork. We see dull and uneducated people drinking in new ideas, mysteriously\r\ngrowing in their knowledge of Christian truth, and learning to\r\nshape their lives by its teachings. We have seen proud, passionate men,\r\nwhose word was formerly law in their village, submit to injury, loss and\r\ninsult, because of their Christian profession, until even their enemies were\r\nput to shame by their gentleness, and were made to be at peace with them.\r\nAnd the men and women and children who are passing through these experiences\r\nare gathering in others, and building up one by one a Christian\r\ncommunity which is becoming a power on the side of all that is good in\r\nthe non-Christian communities around them. . . . Everything is hostile\r\nto it. It is striking its roots in an uncongenial soil, and breathes a\r\npolluted air. It may justly claim for itself the beautiful emblem so happily\r\nseized, though so poorly justified, by Buddhism--the emblem of the\r\nlotus. It roots itself in rotten mud, thrusts up the spears of its leaves and\r\nblossoms through the foul and stagnant water, and lifts its spotless petals\r\nover all, holding them up pure, stainless and fragrant, in the face of a\r\nburning and pitiless sun. So it is with the Christian life in China Its\r\nexistence there is a continuous miracle of life, of life more abundant.''[81]\r\n\r\n\r\n[81] ``Mission Problems and Mission Methods in South China,'' pp. 29-31,\r\n240.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it said that these Asiatics have become Christians for\r\ngain? Then how shall we account for the fact that out of\r\ntheir deep poverty they gave for church work last year $2.50\r\nper capita, which is more in proportion to ability than Christians\r\nat home gave? The impoverished Tu-kon farmers rented\r\na piece of land and worked it in common for the support of\r\nthe Lord's work; the Peking school-girls went without their\r\nbreakfasts to save money for their church, and eight graduates\r\nof Shantung College refused high salaries as teachers, and accepted\r\nlow salaries as pastors of self-supporting churches.\r\n``Rice Christians?'' Doubtless in some instances, just as at\r\nhome some people join American churches for business or\r\nsocial ends. But those Chinese Christians are receiving less\r\nand less from abroad and yet their number grows.\r\n\r\nAnd it costs something to be a Christian in China. All\r\nhope of official preferment must be abandoned, for the duties\r\nof every magistrate include temple ceremonies that no Christian\r\ncould conduct. For the average Christian, loss of business,\r\nsocial ostracism, bitter hatred, are the common price.\r\nNear Peking, a young man was thrice beaten and denied the\r\nuse of the village well, mill and field insurance, because he became\r\na Christian. A widow was dragged through the streets\r\nwith a rope about her neck and beaten with iron rods which\r\ncut her body to the bone, while her fiendish persecutors yelled:--\r\n``You will follow the foreign devils, will you!'' And that\r\nChinese saint replied that she was not following foreigners but\r\nJesus Christ and that she would not deny Him!\r\n\r\nAnd so on every hand there are evidences of fidelity in service,\r\nof tribulation joyfully borne, of systematic giving out of\r\nscanty resources. While sapient critics are telling us that the\r\nheathen cannot be converted, the heathen are not only being\r\nconverted but are manifesting a consecration and self-denial\r\nwhich should shame many in Christian lands. At a Presbyterial\r\nmeeting in north China, the native ministers held a two-\r\nhours' prayer-meeting before daylight. Such prayer-meetings\r\nare not common in America. Is it surprising that in that\r\nlittle North China Presbytery 292 baptisms were recorded that\r\nyear?\r\n\r\nNor is this a solitary instance. Every Sunday the little\r\ncongregations gather. Every day the native helpers tell the\r\nBible-story to their listening countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe history of missions in China has shown that it requires\r\nmore time to convert a Chinese to Christianity than some other\r\nheathen, but that he can be converted and that when he is\r\nconverted, he holds to his new faith with a tenacity and fortitude\r\nwhich the most awful persecution seldom shakes. The\r\nbehaviour of the Chinese Christians under the baptism of blood\r\nand fire to which they were subjected in the Boxer uprising\r\neloquently testified to the genuineness of their faith. That\r\nsome should have fallen away was to be expected. Not every\r\nChristian, even in the United States, can ``endure hardness.''\r\nLet a hundred men anywhere be told that if they do not abandon\r\ntheir faith, their homes will be burned, their business\r\nruined, their wives ravished, their children brained, and they\r\nthemselves scourged and beheaded, and a proportion of them\r\nwill flinch.\r\n\r\nIt was to be expected, too, that when, after the uprising, the\r\nChristians found their supporters triumphing over a prostrate\r\nfoe, some of them should unduly exult and take advantage of\r\nthe opportunity to punish their enemies or to collect money\r\nfrom them as the price of protection. The spirit of retaliation\r\nis strong in human nature in China as well as in America.\r\nWhen the armies of the Allies, led by educated and experienced\r\nofficers, and controlled by diplomats from old-established\r\nChristian countries, gave way under the provocation of the\r\ntime to unmeasured greed and vindictive cruelty, it is not surprising\r\nthat some of the Chinese Christians, only just emerged\r\nfrom heathenism, should betray a revengeful spirit towards\r\nmen who had destroyed their property, slaughtered their wives\r\nand children, and hunted the survivors with the ferocity of\r\nwild beasts. In some places, the missionaries had a hard task\r\nin restraining this spirit. It was inevitable, also, that in the\r\nconfusion which followed the victory of the foreigners, some\r\n``wolves'' should put on ``sheep's clothing,'' and, under the\r\npretense of being Christians, extort money from the terror-\r\nstricken villagers, or try to deceive the foreigner with false\r\nclaims for indemnity.\r\n\r\nBut as I visited the scenes of disaster, saw the frightful ruin,\r\nheard the stories of Christians and missionaries, faced the\r\nlittle companies of survivors and learned more of the awful\r\nordeal through which they had passed, I marvelled, not that\r\nsome yielded, but that so many stood steadfast. Edicts were\r\nissued commanding them to recant on pain of dire punishment,\r\nbut promising protection to those who obeyed. The following\r\nproclamation posted on the wall of the yamen at Ching-chou-fu\r\nis a sample of hundreds:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``The Taku forts have been retaken by the Chinese. Gen.\r\nTung Fu Shiang has led the Boxers and the goddesses, and\r\nhas destroyed twenty foreign men-of-war, killing 6,000 foreign\r\nsoldiers. The seven devilish countries' consuls came to beg for\r\npeace. General Tung now has killed all the foreign soldiers.\r\nThe secondary devils (the native Christians) must die. General\r\nTung has ordered the Boxers to go to the foreign countries\r\nand bring out their devil emperors from their holes. One foreigner\r\nmust not be allowed to live. All who are not Chinese\r\nmust be destroyed.''\r\n\r\nIt requires no large knowledge of Chinese character to calculate\r\nthe effect of such official utterances on the minds of lawless\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nWord sped from a Chinese city that on a certain day all\r\nChristians who had not recanted could be pillaged. From\r\nevery quarter, the lawless streamed in, eager for the shambles.\r\nRuffians pointed out the women they intended to take. And\r\nthere was no foreigner to protect, no regiment or battleship\r\nfor the Chinese Christian.\r\n\r\nThose poor people, hardly out of their spiritual infancy,\r\nstood in that awful emergency absolutely alone. Could an\r\nAmerican congregation have endured such a strain without\r\nflinching? Let those who can safely worship God according\r\nto the dictates of their own consciences be thankful that the\r\ngenuineness of their faith has never been subjected to that\r\nsupreme test.\r\n\r\nThose were grievous days for the Christians of China.\r\nTwo graduates of Teng-chou College remained for weary\r\nweeks in a filthy dungeon when they might have purchased freedom\r\nat any moment by renouncing Christianity. Pastor Meng\r\nof Paoting-fu, a direct descendant of Mencius, was 120 miles\r\nfrom home when the outbreak occurred. He was safe where\r\nhe was, but he hurried back to die with his flock. He was\r\nstabbed, his arm twisted out of joint and his back scorched\r\nwith burning candles in the effort to make him recant. But\r\nhe steadfastly refused to compromise either himself or his\r\npeople and was finally beheaded.\r\n\r\nThe uneducated peasant was no whit behind his cultivated\r\ncountrymen in devotion to duty. A poor cook was seized and\r\nbeaten, his ears were cut off, his mouth and cheeks gashed\r\nwith a sword and other unspeakable mutilations inflicted. Yet\r\nhe stood as firmly as any martyr of the early Church.\r\n\r\nOne of the Chinese preachers, on refusing to apostatize,\r\nreceived a hundred blows upon his bare back, and then the\r\nbleeding sufferer was told to choose between obedience and\r\nanother hundred blows. What would we have answered? Let\r\nus, who have never been called on to suffer for Him, be modest\r\nin saying what we would have done. But that mangled, half-\r\ndead Chinese gasped:--``I value Jesus Christ more than life,\r\nand I will never deny Him.'' Before all of the second hundred\r\nblows could be inflicted, unconsciousness came and he\r\nwas left for dead. But a friend took him away by night,\r\nbathed his wounds and secretly nursed him to recovery. I saw\r\nhim, when I was in China, and I looked reverently upon the\r\nback that was seamed and scarred with ``the marks of the\r\nLord Jesus.'' Of the hundreds of Christians who were taken\r\ninside the legation grounds in Peking, not one proved false to\r\ntheir benefactors. ``In the midday heat, in the drenching\r\nnight rains, under storms of shot and shell, they fought, filled\r\nsand-bags, built barricades, dug trenches, sang hymns and\r\noffered prayers to the God whom the foreigner had taught\r\nthem to love.'' Even the children were faithful. During the\r\nscream of deadly bullets, and the roar of burning buildings,\r\nthe voices of the Junior Christian Endeavour Society were\r\nheard singing:--\r\n\r\n        ``There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes.''\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch instances could be multiplied almost indefinitely from\r\nthe experiences of Chinese Christians during the Boxer uprising.\r\nIndeed the fortitude of the persecuted Christians was so remarkable\r\nthat in many cases the Boxers cut out the hearts of\r\ntheir victims to find the secret of such sublime faith, declaring:\r\n``They have eaten the foreigner's medicine.'' In those humble\r\nChinese the world has again seen a vital faith, again seen\r\nthat the age of heroism has not passed, again seen that men\r\nand women are willing to die for Christ. Multitudes withstood\r\na persecution as frightful as that of the early disciples in\r\nthe gardens and arenas of Nero. If they were hypocrites why\r\ndid they not recant? As Dr. Maltbie Babcock truly said:--\r\n``One-tenth of the hypocrisy with which they were charged\r\nwould have saved them from martyrdom.'' But thousands\r\nof them died rather than abjure their faith, and thousands\r\nmore ``had trial of mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover\r\nof bonds and imprisonment; they were stoned, they were\r\nsawn asunder, they were tempted, they were slain with the\r\nsword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins; being\r\ndestitute, afflicted, ill-treated; wandering in deserts and\r\nmountains and caves and the holes of the earth.''\r\n\r\nCol. Charles Denby, late United States Minister to China,\r\ndeclared:--``Not two per cent. of the Chinese Christians proved\r\nrecreant to their faith and many meet death as martyrs. Let\r\nus not call them `Rice Christians' any more. Their conduct\r\nat the British Legation and the Peitang is deserving of all\r\npraise.''[82] Beyond question, the Chinese Christians as a body\r\nstood the test of fire and blood quite as well as an equal\r\nnumber of American Christians would have stood it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[82] Letter, April 28, 1902.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most trying experiences of the missionaries\r\nhas been the dealing with those who did recant. Some of the\r\ncases were pitiful. Poor, ignorant men, confessed their sin\r\nwith streaming eyes, saying that they did not mean to deny\r\ntheir Lord, but that they could not see their wives outraged\r\nand their babies' heads crushed against stone walls. Others\r\nadmitted that, though they stood firm while one hundred blows\r\nwere rained upon their bare backs, yet after that they became\r\nconfused and were only dimly conscious of what they said to\r\nescape further agony than flesh and blood could endure.\r\nStill others made a distinction, unfamiliar to us, but quite in\r\nharmony with Oriental hereditary notions, between the convictions\r\nof the heart and the profession of the lips, so that they\r\nexternally and temporarily bowed their heads to the storm\r\nwithout feeling that they were thereby renouncing their faith.\r\nOne of the best Chinese ministers in Shantung, after 200\r\nlashes, which pounded his back into a pulp, feebly muttered\r\nan affirmative to the question: ``Will you leave the devils'\r\nchurch?'' But he explained afterwards that while he promised\r\nto leave ``the devils' church,'' he did not promise to\r\nleave Christ's Church. The deception was not as apparent to\r\nhim as it is to us whose moral perceptions have been sharpened\r\nby centuries of Christian nurture which have been denied\r\nto the Chinese.\r\n\r\nWhen the proclamation ordering the extermination of all\r\nforeigners and Christians was posted on the walls of Ching-\r\nchou-fu, a friendly official hinted that if the Chinese pastors\r\nwould sign a document to the effect that they would ``no\r\nlonger practice the foreign religion,'' he would accept it as\r\nsufficient on behalf of all their flocks, and not enforce the\r\norder. Warrants for the arrest of every Christian had already\r\nbeen written. Scoundrels were hurrying in from distant villages\r\nto join in the riot of plunder and lust. Two women\r\nhad already been killed. What were the pastors to do?\r\nThere was no missionary to guide them, for long before the\r\nconsuls had ordered all foreigners out of the interior. The\r\nagonized pastors determined to sacrifice themselves for their\r\ninnocent people, to go through the form of giving up the\r\n``foreign'' religion. That word ``foreign'' must be emphasized\r\nto understand their temptation, for the Chinese Christians\r\ndo not feel that Christianity is foreign, but that it is\r\ntheirs as well as ours. Moreover, the pastors were made to\r\nunderstand that it was simply a legal fiction, not affecting\r\nthe religion of their hearts, but only a temporary expedient\r\nthat the friendly magistrate might have a pretext for giving\r\nhis protection to the Christians. They were not asked to\r\nengage in any idolatrous rite or to make any public apostasy,\r\nbut simply to sign a statement ``no longer to practice the\r\nforeign religion.'' ``So far from recanting,'' it was urged\r\nupon them, ``you are preventing recanting.''\r\n\r\nTheir decision may be best given in the words of Pastor\r\nWu Chien Cheng: ``When I thought of these people,'' he\r\nsaid, his emotion being so great that the tears were running down\r\nhis face, ``in most cases with children and aged parents dependent\r\nupon them, and thought of all that was involved for\r\nthem if I refused to sign the paper--well, I couldn't help it.\r\nI decided to take on myself the shame and the sin.''\r\n\r\nAs the Rev. J. P. Bruce, of the English Baptist Mission,\r\nwho told me of this incident, truly says: ``Who could listen\r\nto such a narrative--so sad and painful and yet not without\r\nmuch that was noble--without sympathy and tears?'' In this\r\nspirit of tenderness, so marked in the Lord's dealings with\r\nsinful Peter, the missionaries dealt with the recanting Christians.\r\nWith the impostors, indeed, they had less mercy. The\r\nRev. R. M. Mateer secured the arrest of two scapegraces who,\r\nunder pretense of being Christians, had blackmailed innocent\r\nvillagers. Very plainly, too, did the missionaries deal with\r\nChristians, who, like some people in the United States after a\r\nfire, placed an extravagant valuation upon what they had lost.\r\nBut these were exceptional cases.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Christians in Europe and America may well\r\nhave stronger sympathy and respect for their fellow-Christians\r\nin China who have suffered so much for conscience' sake.\r\nPurified and chastened by the fearful holocaust through which\r\nthey have passed, they are stronger spiritually than ever before.\r\nLike the apostles after Pentecost, they are giving ``with great\r\npower their witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.''\r\n``The Chinese Church is not yet strong enough to stand\r\nentirely alone, but it is far stronger and more self-conscious of\r\nthe eternal indwelling Spirit than ever before. It has learned\r\nthe power of God to keep the soul in times of deadly peril,\r\nand to enable the weakest to give the strongest testimony. It\r\nhas learned by humiliation and confession to put away its sins,\r\nand to gird itself for new conflicts and new victories....\r\nIts ablest leaders are more trustworthy men than before their\r\ntrials, and the body of believers has a unity and a cohesiveness\r\nwhich will certainly bear fruit in the not distant future.''[83]\r\n\r\n\r\n[83] Smith, ``Rex Christus,'' p. 212.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE STRAIN OF READJUSTMENT TO CHANGED\r\nECONOMIC CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nTHE economic revolution in Asia, discussed in a\r\npreceding chapter,[84] bears heavily on the Chinese\r\nChristians. So far as the pressure affects the rank and file\r\nof the membership, the mission boards cannot give adequate\r\nrelief. Abroad as well as at home, it must remain the inexorable\r\nrule that a Christian must live within his income and buy\r\nnew things only as he can pay for them. Any other policy\r\nwould mean utter ruin. Here also, men must ``work out their\r\nown salvation''; and the missionary, while trying to lift men\r\nout of barbarous social conditions on the one hand, should on\r\nthe other resolutely oppose the improvident eagerness which\r\nleads a blanketed Sioux Indian to buy on credit a rubber-tired\r\nsurrey.\r\n\r\n\r\n[84] Chapter IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut what about the native ministers and teachers, who find\r\nit impossible to live on the salaries of a decade ago? The\r\nproblem of the ordinary helper is not so difficult. Springing\r\nfrom the common people, accustomed from childhood to a\r\nmeagre scale of living, the small salaries which the people can\r\npay either in full or in large part are usually equal to the\r\nincome which they would have had if they had not become\r\nChristians. But some native ministers come from a higher\r\nsocial grade. They are men of education and refinement.\r\nThey cannot live in a mud hut, go barefooted, wear a loin cloth\r\nand subsist on a few cents' worth of rice a day. They must not\r\nonly have better houses and food and clothing, but they must\r\nhave books and periodicals and the other apparatus of educated\r\nmen. These things are not only necessary to their own maintenance,\r\nbut they are essential to the work, for these men are\r\nthe main reliance for influencing the upper classes in favour of\r\nChristianity. It is not a question of luxury or self-indulgence,\r\nbut of bare respectability, of the simple decencies of life which\r\nare enjoyed by an American mechanic as distinguished from\r\nthe poverty which, for a cultivated family, falls below the level\r\nof self-respect. But this requires a salary which, save in a\r\nvery few places, cannot at present be paid by the churches.\r\n``Our pastors,'' writes a missionary, ``are supposed to live as\r\nthe middle-class of their people do, but of late years, with the\r\ngreat rise in prices, they are living below the middle-class.''\r\n\r\nThe consequences are not only pinching poverty but sometimes\r\na feeling of wrong, and, in some cases, a yielding to\r\ntemptation. One Chinese pastor, for example, who was trying\r\nto support a wife and five children on $10 Mex. ($5) a month,\r\nshipwrecked his influence by trying to supplement his scanty\r\nincome by helping in lawsuits. Can we wonder that he felt\r\nobliged to do something, almost anything?\r\n\r\nBut who is to pay the higher salaries that are now so necessary?\r\nThe first impulse is to look to the mission boards in\r\nEurope and America, and accordingly missionaries and Christians\r\nare importunately calling for increased appropriations.\r\nBut whatever temporary and occasional relief may be given in\r\nthis way, as a permanent remedy, it is plainly impossible. If\r\nthe conditions were simply sporadic and local, the case might\r\nbe different. But they are universal, or fast becoming so, and\r\nthey will be permanent. It is quite visionary to suppose that the\r\nincome of the mission boards will permit them to meet the\r\nwhole or even the larger part of the increased cost of living\r\namong the myriads of ministers, teachers and helpers in the\r\ngrowing churches of China. American Christians cannot be\r\nreasonably expected to add such an enormous burden to the\r\nalready large responsibilities which they are carrying in their\r\nvaried forms of home work and the present scale of foreign\r\nmissionary expenditure. Even if they could and would, it\r\nwould be at the expense of all further enlargement of the work,\r\nand at the same time it would still further weaken an already\r\nweak sense of self-reliance among the native ministers and\r\nhelpers of Asia.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the average Christian giver in America is feeling\r\nthe same strain himself. The so-called ``era of prosperity''\r\nhas given more steady employment to the mechanic, has given\r\nbetter markets to the producer, and has enormously increased\r\nthe wealth of many who were already rich. But the men on\r\nfixed salaries find that ``prosperity'' has increased the prices\r\nof commodities without proportionately increasing earnings.\r\nMillions of American church members find it harder to give\r\nthan they did ten years ago, for while their incomes are about\r\nthe same, they must pay higher prices for meats, groceries and\r\nclothing. True, many salaries were cut down during the financial\r\nstringency of 1896-1897, but while some of them have\r\nbeen restored to their former figure, few have been raised above\r\ntheir original level, while others are still below it. Meantime\r\nofficial statistics show that the average cost of food is 10.9 per\r\ncent. higher than the average for the decade between 1890 and\r\n1899, and that there has been an increase of 16.1 per cent. as\r\ncompared with 1896, the year of lowest prices.[85] It is urged that\r\nthe wages of workmen have increased in proportion. But however\r\ntrue this may be of organized labour, it is palpably untrue of\r\nthe great middle-class who are neither capitalists nor members\r\nof labour unions. They form the bulk of the church membership\r\nand to them ``Mr. Wright's statement will carry no reassurance.\r\nIt is they who have been hit hardest by the increased\r\ncost of living for their incomes have not kept pace with it.\r\nIndeed, they are actually worse off to-day than they were\r\neight, ten or fifteen years ago.''[86] Dun's Review, an acknowledged\r\nauthority, declares that not in twenty years has it cost\r\nso much to live as now, and that March 1, 1904, the average\r\nprices of breadstuffs were thirty per cent. higher than they were\r\nseven years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n[85] Report of the Hon. Carroll D. Wright, Commissioner of Labour, 1903\r\n\r\n[86] The Youth's Companion, October 29, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn such circumstances, it is clearly out of the question for\r\nthe Christians of the United States to meet these enlarged demands\r\nfor the support of their own families and, in addition,\r\nmeet them for the churches in China.\r\n\r\nIf then, the problem of the increased cost of living in Asia\r\ncannot be solved by increased gifts from America, what other\r\nsolutions are possible? As an experienced missionary says:--\r\n``To ask for more from America seems like a step backward;\r\nbut to leave matters as they are is to see our churches seriously\r\ncrippled.'' Four possible solutions may be mentioned.\r\n\r\nFirst:--Stop all expansion of the work and use any increase\r\nin receipts to raise salaries. This is undoubtedly worthy of\r\nthoughtful consideration. To what extent is it right to open\r\nnew fields and enlarge old ones when the workers now employed\r\nare inadequately paid? Plainly, the mission boards\r\nshould carefully consider this aspect of the question. As a\r\nmatter of fact, many of them have already considered it. The\r\nPresbyterian Board has repeatedly declined urgent requests to\r\nestablish new stations on the ground that it could not do so in\r\njustice to its existing work. But as a practicable solution, this\r\nmethod is open to serious difficulties. A living work must grow,\r\nand the living forces which govern that growth are more or less\r\nbeyond the control of the boards. The boards are amenable\r\nto their constituencies and those constituencies sometimes imperatively\r\ndemand the occupation of a new field, as, for example,\r\nthey did in the case of the Philippine Islands, some\r\nboards which at first decided not to enter the Philippines being\r\nafterwards forced into them by a pressure of denominational\r\nopinion that they could not ignore. Moreover, the missionaries\r\nthemselves are equally insistent in their demands for enlargement.\r\nSome boards are literally deluged with such appeals.\r\nThe missionaries who have most strenuously insisted on\r\nthe policy of no further expansion till the existing work is better\r\nsustained have sometimes been the very ones who have\r\nstrongly urged that an exception should be made in their particular\r\nfields, without realizing that the argument from ``exceptions''\r\nis so often pressed that it is really the rule and not the\r\nexception at all. And the churches and missionaries are\r\nusually right. God is calling His people to go forward. His\r\nvoice is frequently very plain, and the boards, with all their\r\ncare and conservatism, are then obliged to expand.\r\n\r\nSecond:--Diminish the number of native pastors, helpers and\r\nteachers and increase their work. In some places, this might\r\nbe done by grouping congregations and fields. But the places\r\nwhere this could be wisely effected are so few that the relief to\r\nthe situation as a whole would not be appreciable, especially as\r\nthe native Christians would not give so liberally under such an\r\narrangement. Their sense of responsibility would be weakened\r\nif they had only a half or a quarter of a pastor's time instead\r\nof the whole of it. Besides, the native force is far too\r\nsmall now. Instead of being diminished it should be largely\r\nincreased. The great work of the future must be done by native\r\nministers. If China is ever to be evangelized, it must\r\nbe to a large degree by Chinese evangelists. To adopt deliberately\r\nthe policy of restricting the number of such evangelists\r\nand teachers would be suicidal. As a solution, therefore, this\r\nmethod is quite impracticable, as it would be a relief at the expense\r\nof efficiency.\r\n\r\nThird:--Require native leaders to earn their own living either\r\nwholly or in part. There is Pauline example for this method.\r\nSome of the Presbyterian missionaries in Laos have adopted it\r\nby inducing the members of a congregation to secure a ricefield\r\nand a humble house for their minister. The Korea missionaries\r\nhave very successfully worked this method by insisting\r\nthat the leaders of groups shall continue in their former occupations\r\nand give their services to Christian work without pay,\r\nin some such way as Sunday-school superintendents and other\r\nunpaid workers do in America. This method is deserving of\r\nwider adoption. It would give considerable relief in many\r\nother fields. It was probably the way that the early church\r\ngrew.\r\n\r\n\r\n``Two opinions,'' says Dr. J. J. Lucas, ``have been held in regard to\r\nthe basis on which the salaries of native agents should be fixed. One is\r\nthat such a salary should be paid as would remove all excuse for engaging\r\nin secular work, demanding all the time of the pastor for spiritual work;\r\nanother is, that acknowledging the salary to be insufficient, the pastors be\r\nexpected to supplement it by what they can get from field and vineyard.\r\nIf self-support is to be aimed at, at all cost, then the latter plan is the only\r\nfeasible one, with the dangers of its abuse. There is no doubt, however,\r\nthat a man who loves the gospel ministry and is devoted to it can, without\r\nthe neglect of spiritual affairs, do enough outside to lessen materially the\r\nburden that would fall on the church in his support.''\r\n\r\n\r\nBut this method of itself would hardly solve the problem.\r\nHowever well adapted to the beginnings of mission work, it\r\nfails to provide a properly qualified native leadership. To do\r\nefficient work, a native pastor must give his whole time to it,\r\nand to that end he must have a salary that will make him ``free\r\nfrom worldly cares and avocations.'' We insist on this in the\r\nUnited States and the reasons for such a policy are as strong\r\non the foreign field. The minister in Asia as well as the minister\r\nin America must have a salary. The labourer is worthy of\r\nhis hire.\r\n\r\nFourth:--Insist upon a larger measure of self-support. The\r\nnative churches must be led to a fuller responsibility in this\r\nmatter. Grave as are the temporary embarrassments which the\r\nincreased cost of living is forcing upon them and trying as is\r\nthe permanent distress of some of them, yet as a whole the\r\neconomic revolution will undoubtedly enlarge the earning\r\ncapacity of the native Christians. Indeed, the new principles\r\nof life which the gospel brings should make them among the\r\nfirst to profit by the changed conditions, and as their wealth\r\nincreases, their spirit of giving should, and under the wise lead-\r\nership of the missionaries undoubtedly will, increase. For\r\nthese reasons, the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions took\r\nthe following action July 2, 1900:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``As having reference to the question of self-support of the native\r\nchurches on the mission field, and in view of the fact that some of its missions\r\nare proposing to increase the salaries of native preachers and helpers\r\non account of the increased cost of living, the Board is constrained to look\r\nwith no little apprehension upon the prospect of continuing and increasing\r\ndemands of foreign aid in proportion to the contributions made by the\r\nchurches themselves. Increased intercourse of eastern nations with those\r\nof the west has led and will still further lead to a gradual assimilation to\r\nwestern ways and western prices, and unless the self-reliant spirit of the\r\nchurches can be stimulated to a proportionate advance, there is a sure\r\nprospect that the drafts upon mission funds will be larger and larger in\r\nproportion to the amount of work accomplished. In view of these considerations,\r\nit was resolved that the missions in which such increase is\r\nproposed be earnestly requested to arouse the churches to the purpose and\r\nthe endeavour to meet this increased expenditure instead of laying still\r\nlarger burdens upon the resources of foreign funds. The Board deems\r\nthis necessary not merely to the interest of its expanding work but to the\r\nself-reliant character, the future stability and self-propagating power of\r\nthe churches themselves.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThere appears to be no alternative. And yet this policy,\r\nwhile adhered to, should be enforced with reasonable discretion\r\nand due regard to ``this present distress.'' How can Christians,\r\nwho can barely live themselves and pay a half or two-\r\nthirds of their pastor's present support, suddenly meet this call\r\nfor enlarged salaries? For reasons already given, it is harder\r\nfor them to make ends meet now than it was in the old days\r\nof primitive simplicity, while in many places a profession of\r\nChristianity is followed by the loss of property and employment\r\nso that the Christian is impoverished by the loss of the income\r\nthat he already had. In these circumstances, both boards and\r\nmissions must simply do the best they can, and neither allow\r\nthe emergency to sweep them into a mistaken charity that\r\n\r\nwould be fatal to the ultimate interests of the cause nor allow a\r\nvaluable native worker to suffer for the necessaries of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n``We need to bear in mind that the low salaries of China are not the\r\nproduct of Christianity, but of heathenism, and the ability to live on five\r\nor six Mexicans per month is not the result of a laudable economy unknown\r\nto Christian countries, so much as it is the result of a degradation\r\nof manhood to the level of beasts. The church is responsible for\r\nthe knowledge of a better way of living. We have created the desire for\r\na clean house, clean clothing, healthful food, and books, on the part of our\r\neducated young men. Shall we implant this desire for six or eight years\r\nand take the rest of the man's life in trying to squelch it? We have come\r\nas apostles of truth to a mighty empire, to the great and the small, to the\r\nrich and the poor, and if we had a native ministry which could appeal to\r\na different class of men than most of them are now appealing to, would\r\nnot the day of self-support be hastened beyond what we dare to hope? Is\r\nthere not a feeling out for something better on the part of the well-to-do,\r\nthe more intelligent, just as really as there is on the part of the lowest\r\nclasses? Do not we have a mission to the man who can pay $100.00\r\na year to the church just as really as to the one who pays 100 cash?\r\nThere is nothing so costly as cheap men. Let us have a higher grade of\r\nmen and we shall have a higher grade of church-membership. Is it not\r\ntrue that nothing more stands in the way of self-support than some of our\r\nnative clergy? We must not turn down better men because they must\r\nhave a little more to live upon than poor men.''[87]\r\n\r\n\r\n[87] Mr. F. S. Brockman, Address--``How to Retain to the Church the\r\nServices of English-Speaking Christians,'' Shanghai, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is idle, however, to urge as a reason for increasing the salaries\r\nof Chinese ministers that a qualified Asiatic can earn more\r\nin commercial life than in the ministry. Such arguments often\r\ncome to mission boards. But religious work cannot compete\r\nwith business in financial inducements either at home or\r\nabroad. It is notorious that in America, ministers and church\r\nworkers generally do not receive the compensation which they\r\ncould command in secular employments or professions. The\r\nqualities that bring success in the ministry are, as a rule, far\r\nmore liberally remunerated in secular life. The preacher who\r\ncan command $6,000 or $8,000 in the pulpit could probably\r\ncommand three or four times that amount in the law or in\r\nbusiness. Men who are as eminent in other professions and in\r\nthe commercial world as the most eminent clergymen are in the\r\nministry usually have incomes ranging from $20,000 to $100,000\r\na year and have no ``dead line'' of age either. As for\r\nothers, the Rev. Dr. B. L. Agnew, Secretary of the Presbyterian\r\nBoard of Ministerial Relief, is authority for the statement\r\nthat the average salary of Presbyterian ministers is $700 and\r\nthat for all denominations it does not equal the wages of the average\r\nmechanic. A missionary writes:--``Practically all our native\r\npastors are underpaid.'' The same thing might be said of all\r\nthe home missionaries and of most of the pastors of non-missionary\r\nchurches at home, one-third of whom receive only\r\n$500 or less.\r\n\r\nThe churches of America cannot, or at any rate will not, do\r\nfor the native ministers of Asia what they are not doing for\r\ntheir own ministers. The world over, the rewards of Christ's\r\nservice are not financial. Those who seek that service must be\r\ncontent with modest support, sometimes even with poverty.\r\nThis is not a reason for the home churches to be content with\r\ntheir present scale of missionary giving, nor does it mean that\r\nmission boards are disposed to refuse requests for appropriations.\r\nThe boards are straining every nerve to secure a more\r\ngenerous support and they will gladly send all they can to the\r\nmissions on the field. But it is a reason for impressing more\r\nstrongly upon the young men in the churches of Asia that they\r\nshould consecrate themselves to the Master's service from a\r\nhigher motive than financial support and that while the boards\r\nwill continue to give all the assistance that is in their power,\r\nyet that the permanent dependence of the ministers of China\r\nmust be in increasing measure upon the Christians of China and\r\nnot upon the Christians of America. Hundreds of native pastors\r\nare already realizing this and are manifesting a self-sacrificing\r\ncourage and devotion that are beyond all praise. Said Mr.\r\nFitch of Ningpo to a Chinese youth of fine education and exceptional\r\nability:--``Suppose a business man should offer you\r\n$100.00 a month and at the same time you had the way opened\r\nto you to study for the ministry, and after entering it, to get\r\nfrom $20.00 to $30.00 a month, which would you take?''\r\nAnd the youth answered--``I would enter the ministry.''\r\n``He is now teaching a mission school at $12.00 a month,\r\nthough he could easily command $30.00 a month in a business\r\nposition.'' The hope of the churches of China is in such men.\r\nMr. F. S. Brockman declares:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``There is a wide-spread conviction among missionaries that the allurements\r\nof wealth alone are keeping English-speaking young men from the\r\nministry. The facts do not bear out this belief. . . . In order to hold\r\nthem in the ministry we need not appeal to their love of money. It is\r\ndeath to the ministry when we do it; we have opened the vial of their\r\nfiercest passion; we are doing what Jesus Christ never did; we are working\r\nabsolutely contrary to the fundamental laws of the kingdom of God.\r\n. . . We must teach prospective ministers to look upon their lives as\r\nan unselfish expenditure of God-given power. For once make the allurement\r\nof the ministry the allurement of comfort, ease, or wealth, and we\r\nhave closed up every fountain of the minister's power.''\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\nCOMITY AND COOPERATION\r\n\r\nTHE Hon. Charles Denby, then United States Minister\r\nat Peking, wrote in 1900:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``With all due deference to the great missionary societie,\r\nwho have these matters in charge, my judgment is that missionary work\r\nin China has been overdone. Take Peking as an example. There are located\r\nat Peking the following Protestant missions: American Boards\r\nAmerican Presbyterian, American Methodist, Christian and Missionary\r\nAlliance, International Y. M. C. A., London Missionary Society, Society\r\nfor the Propagation of the Gospel, International Institute, Mission for\r\nChinese Blind, Scotch Bible Society, and the Society for the Diffusion of\r\nChristian Knowledge. To these must be added the Church of England\r\nMission, the English Baptist Mission and the Swedish Mission. The\r\nabove list shows that of American societies alone there are seven in Peking,\r\nnot counting the Peking University, and that all western Powers\r\ntaken collectively were represented by about twenty missions. A careful\r\nstudy of the situation would seem to suggest that no two American societies\r\nshould occupy the same district.''[88]\r\n\r\n\r\n[88] Missionary Review of the World, October, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be well to examine this criticism, partly because it\r\nwas made by an able man of known sympathy with mission\r\nwork, and partly because it relates to the city where, if anywhere,\r\nin China, overcrowding exists. In considering Peking,\r\ntherefore, we are really considering the broad question of the\r\npracticability of withdrawing some missionary agencies in the\r\ninterest of comity and efficiency. The Presbyterian missionaries\r\nthemselves opened the way for the discussion of the\r\nquestion by proposing to the Congregational missionaries, after\r\nthe Boxer uprising had been quelled, ``an exchange of all work\r\nand fields of our Presbyterian Church in the province of\r\nChih-li in return for the work and fields of the American\r\nBoard in the province of Shantung, subject to the approval of\r\nour respective Boards.'' The Mission added:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``It means no little sacrifice to sever attachments made in long years of\r\nservice in fields and among a people whom God has enabled us to lead to\r\nChrist, but we feel that a high spirit of loyalty to Christ and His cause,\r\ninspiring all concerned, will lead us to set aside personal preferences and\r\nattachments, if thereby the greater interests of His Church in China can be\r\nconserved.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole question was thoroughly discussed during my\r\nvisit in Peking. Much time was spent traversing the entire\r\nground. Then a meeting was called of the leading missionaries\r\nof all the Protestant agencies represented in Peking.\r\n\r\nThe result of all these conferences was the unanimous and\r\nemphatic judgment of the missionaries of all the boards concerned\r\nthat there is not ``a congestion of missionary societies\r\nin Peking,'' and that no one board could be spared without\r\nserious injury to the cause. In reply to the proposal of the\r\nPresbyterian missionaries, the North China Mission of the\r\nAmerican Board wrote--\r\n\r\n\r\n``After considering the matter in all its bearings we are constrained to\r\nsay that we contemplate with regret any plan which looks to the withdrawal\r\nof the Presbyterian Mission from the field which they have so long\r\noccupied in northern Chih-li. We think that instead of illustrating comity\r\nthis would appear as if comity was not to be attained without a violent\r\ndislocation from long-established foundations, and that in this particular\r\nthere would be a definite loss all around. . . . We further deprecate the\r\nproposed step because there is now an excellent opportunity for the adoption\r\nor actual measures of cooperation between our respective missions. . . .\r\nWe are ready to readjust boundaries in such a way as to remedy the waste\r\nof effort in the crossing of one another's territory. . . . We are confident\r\nthat the ultimate outcome could not fail to be a greater benefit than the sudden\r\nrupture of long-existing relations for the sake of mere geographical\r\ncontiguity of the work of missions like yours and ours, each keeping its own\r\ndistrict, careful not to encroach upon the other. In the higher unity here\r\nsuggested we should expect to realize larger results in the promotion of\r\ncomity not only, but also in the best interests of that kingdom of God for\r\nwhich we are each labouring.\r\n                    ``ARTHUR H. SMITH,\r\n                    ``D. Z. SHEFFIELD,\r\n                              ``Committee.''\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, several of the agencies enumerated by Colonel\r\nDenby, such as the Y. M. C. A., the International Institute,\r\nthe Mission to the Blind, the various Bible Societies, and the\r\nSociety for the Diffusion of Christian Knowledge, are not\r\ncompeting missionary agencies at all, but are doing a special\r\nwork along such separate lines that it is unfair to take them\r\ninto consideration. As a matter of fact, with the exception of\r\na comparatively small work by the Society for the Propagation\r\nof the Gospel, the real missionary work in Peking is being done\r\nby only four Boards,--The American, Methodist, London, and\r\nPresbyterian. This is not a disproportionate number, considering\r\nthe fact that Peking is one of the great cities of the world\r\nand the capital of the Empire. It is of the utmost importance\r\nthat a strong Christian influence should be exerted in such a\r\ncentre. Indeed, if there is any place in all China where this influence\r\nought to be intensified, it is Peking. It is granted that\r\nChristian work is more difficult in a great city, that it is harder\r\nto convert a man there than in a country village. But, on the\r\nother hand, he is more influential when he is converted.\r\nPeking is the heart of China. Alone of all its cities, it is\r\nvisited sooner or later by every ambitious scholar and prominent\r\nofficial. The examinations for the higher degrees bring\r\nto it myriads of the brightest young men of the country. The\r\nmoral effect of a strong Christian Church in Peking will be felt\r\nin every province. If Christianity is to be a positive regenerative\r\nforce in China it cannot afford to weaken its hold in the\r\nvery citadel of China's power.\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that the work of the missionaries\r\nstationed at Peking is not confined to the city, but that Peking\r\nis a base from which they work out on the east and south till\r\nthey reach the boundaries of the Tien-tsin and Paoting-fu\r\nstation fields, while on the north and west a vast and populous\r\nregion for an indefinite distance is wholly dependent upon them\r\nfor Christian teaching. Extensive and densely inhabited areas\r\nof the province are not being worked by any board. The Rev.\r\nDr. John Wherry, who has lived there for a generation, says\r\nthat there are a hundred times as many people in the Peking\r\nregion as are now being reached, and that there are 20,000,000\r\nin the province who have never yet heard of Christ. For this\r\nenormous field the missionary agencies now at work are really\r\nfew. Hundreds of American cities of half a million inhabitants\r\nhave a greater number of ordained workers than this entire\r\nprovince of Chih-li with a population nearly half as large as that\r\nof the United States. Indeed there is room for a great extension\r\nof the work without overcrowding.\r\n\r\nEach denomination occupies a large and distinct geographical\r\nfield in this province. For example, all that portion of the city\r\nand suburbs of Peking north of the line of the Forbidden City,\r\nwith a population of about 200,000, is considered Presbyterian\r\nterritory. No other missionaries are located in\r\nthat part of Peking. In the country, the counties of San-ho,\r\nHuai-jou, Pao-ti, to the north and east of Peking, are also\r\nunderstood to be distinctively Presbyterian ground. San-ho\r\nCounty alone is said to have 1,200 towns and villages, while\r\nthe other counties are also very populous. No other Protestant\r\ndenomination is working in any of these counties. At Paoting-fu,\r\nthe Congregationalists and Presbyterians have made a\r\ndivision of the field, the former taking everything south of a\r\nline drawn through the centre of the city and the latter everything\r\nnorth of that line. Each denomination thus has wholly\r\nto itself half the city of Paoting-fu and about a dozen outlying\r\ncounties.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries of the three other boards concerned plainly\r\nstated that, in the event of the withdrawal of the Presbyterians,\r\nthey would not be able to care for the work that would be left.\r\nThey declared that they were not able adequately to sustain\r\nthe work they already had and that there was not the slightest\r\nreason to hope that their home boards would find it possible to\r\ngive them the reinforcements in men and money which would\r\nbe required if their present responsibilities were to be increased.\r\nThe large district now occupied by any given board would simply\r\nbe vacated if its missionaries were transferred to other regions.\r\nThe ties formed with the Chinese Christians and people\r\nin more than a generation of continuous missionary work\r\nwould be broken and the influence acquired by faithful missionaries\r\nin long years of toil would be lost.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances, would it be right for any one of\r\nthese four boards to withdraw? There will, indeed, come a\r\ntime when it will be the duty of the missionary to leave the\r\nChinese church to itself. But is this the time to go, when the\r\nnative church, instead of being strong and able to care for\r\nitself, is torn and bleeding after frightful persecution? These\r\nChristians look to the missionaries, who have hitherto led them,\r\nas spiritual fathers who will guide them in the future. They\r\nfeel that the time has come for a new consecration to the task\r\nof evangelizing all their people. As directed by the missionaries,\r\nthey may become a great influence for the conversion\r\nof their countrymen. Should they be left when other missionaries\r\nexpressly state that they cannot care for them?\r\n\r\nThe question of closer cooperation, however, is worthy of\r\ncareful consideration. At a conference of representatives of\r\nforeign mission boards of the United States and Canada having\r\nwork in China, held in New York, September 21, 1900,\r\nthe following resolution was unanimously adopted:\r\n\r\n\r\n``It is the judgment of this conference that the resumption of mission\r\nwork in those parts of China where it has been interrupted would afford a\r\nfavourable opportunity for putting into practice some of the principles of\r\nmission comity which have been approved by a general concensus of\r\nopinion among missionaries and boards, especially in regard to the over\r\nlapping of fields and such work as printing and publishing, higher\r\neducation and hospital work, and the conference would commend the subject\r\nto the favourable consideration and action of the various boards and their\r\nmissionaries.''\r\n\r\n\r\nChristian America, which ought to set the example of\r\ncomity, is distractingly divided. Should it not learn something\r\nfrom its experience at home and, as far as possible, organize\r\nits work abroad in such a way as to avoid perpetuating\r\nunnecessary divisions? Should it not at least carefully consider\r\nwhether a limited force cannot be used to better advantage\r\nfor China and for Christ? I admire the ingenuity of those\r\nat home who can find good reasons for having half a dozen\r\ndenominations in a town of a few thousand inhabitants. But on\r\nthe foreign field, we should adopt a different policy. In the\r\nlarge cities--the Londons, and Berlins, and New Yorks, and\r\nChicagos, of Asia, it is conceded that more than one Board\r\nmay properly work. But with such exceptions, it should be\r\nthe rule not to enter fields where other evangelical bodies are\r\nalready established. Indeed it is already the rule. The\r\nShanghai Conference of 1900 voted that missionary agencies\r\nshould not be multiplied in small places, though that cities of\r\nprefectural rank should not be considered the exclusive territory\r\nof any one board. The American Presbyterian Board declared\r\nin 1900, and its action was specifically approved by the\r\nGeneral Assembly of that year:--``The time has come for a\r\nlarger union and cooperation in mission work, and where\r\nchurch union cannot be attained, the Board and the missions\r\nwill seek such divisions of territory as will leave as large districts\r\nas possible to the exclusive care and development of separate\r\nagencies.''\r\n\r\nIn several places, boards and missions are moving actively in\r\nthis direction. In 1902, the American and Presbyterian Boards\r\nentered into a union in educational work in the province of\r\nChih-li by which the Presbyterians conduct a union boarding-\r\nschool for girls in Paoting-fu and for boys in Peking, while the\r\nCongregationalists educate the boys of both denominations in\r\nPaoting-fu and the girls in Peking. A medical college in\r\nPeking was agreed upon in 1903, to be supported and taught\r\njointly by the London, American and Presbyterian missions.\r\nIn the province of Shantung, a notable union in both educational\r\nand medical work was effected in 1903 between English\r\nBaptists and American Presbyterians. Instead of developing\r\nduplicate institutions with all the large expenditure of men and\r\nmoney that would be involved, the boards and missions concerned\r\nare uniting in the development of the Shantung Protestant\r\nUniversity with the Arts College on the Presbyterian\r\ncompound at Wei-hsien and the Theological and Normal\r\nSchool on the Baptist compound at Ching-chou-fu. The\r\nmedical class will be taught alternately at the Baptist and\r\nPresbyterian stations until funds warrant the erection of suitable\r\nbuildings, probably at Chinan-fu, the capital of the province. In\r\nShanghai, the Northern and Southern Methodists established a\r\nunion publishing house in 1902, and in several other parts of\r\nChina, plans for union of various kinds are being discussed.\r\n\r\nAll these enterprises met with opposition at first. There was,\r\nindeed, little objection to union in medical education, for few\r\nquestions of a denominational character are involved in the\r\ntraining of medical students. But it was urged by some that\r\nit would not be expedient to press consolidation in educational\r\nwork, as the chief object of such work was held to be the\r\ntraining of a native ministry and each mission could best educate\r\nits own helpers and should do so in the interest of self-\r\npreservation. The example of the Meiji Gakuin in Tokio, Japan,\r\nwhich is supported by the Presbyterian and Reformed Boards,\r\nwas not deemed determinative as in Japan but one native\r\nchurch is involved, so that the cases are not parallel. Moreover,\r\nit was thought that in a large school there would not be as\r\ngood an opportunity for that close personal contact between\r\nmissionary and pupil which is so desirable.\r\n\r\nThese difficulties, however, are believed by many of the mis-\r\nsionaries to be more theoretical than practical, or, at any rate,\r\nnot sufficiently formidable to prevent a more effective cooperation.\r\nNo plan will be free from all objections and a good effort\r\nshould not be abandoned because they are found to confront\r\nit. The defects in union are less grave than those that experience\r\nhas shown to be inherent in the old method of numerous\r\nweak and struggling institutions whose support requires a\r\nruinous proportion of the mission force and the mission funds\r\nthat might otherwise be available, in part at least, for the enlargement\r\nof the evangelistic work. ``It certainly seems unnecessary\r\nthat two missions should maintain distinct high\r\nschools looking towards a college grade side by side, when the\r\nwhole number of pupils in both could be instructed more\r\neconomically and perhaps more efficiently in one institution.''\r\n\r\nNor is this all, for, wherever practicable, union of allied\r\nchurches is being sought. I know we are told that Christ's\r\nwords do not call for this. But when I hear the laboured arguments\r\nwhich defend the splitting of American Presbyterianism\r\ninto more than a dozen sects, I sympathize with the child who,\r\nafter a sermon in which the minister had eloquently urged that\r\nthe unity for which the Lord prayed was consistent with\r\nseparation, said: ``Mamma, if Christ didn't mean what He\r\nsaid, why didn't He say what He meant?''\r\n\r\nPremature and impracticable efforts should indeed be\r\navoided. The deeply rooted differences of centuries are not to\r\nbe eradicated in a day. We must feel our way along with\r\ncaution and wisdom. To attempt too much at first would be\r\nto accomplish nothing. Work abroad is necessarily a projection\r\nof the work at home and it will be more or less hampered by\r\nour American divisions. A prominent clergyman told me that\r\nhe doubted the wisdom of a union of the Asiatic churches as he\r\nfeared that such a union would weaken the sense of responsibility\r\nof the home churches. He thought that a denomination\r\nin America would take a deeper interest in a comparatively\r\nsmall native church wholly dependent upon it than it would in\r\nan indeterminate part of a larger church. Must the unity of\r\nthe foreign church be sacrificed to the divisions of the home\r\nchurch? Perhaps there is some ground for anticipating such\r\nobjections from home. But if they are found to exist, we\r\nshould not cease seeking union in Asia, but begin preaching\r\njuster views in America.\r\n\r\nI must not be understood as depreciating the historic differences\r\nof Christendom. I am aware that each of the\r\ngreat religious bodies stands for some cardinal principle that\r\nis not emphasized to the same degree by others. The freedom\r\nof any given number of believers to witness to a specific\r\ntruth should not be and need not be limited by union.\r\nThe contention here is that the differences of the West\r\nshould not be forced upon the East but that the churches of\r\nAsia should be given a fair chance to develop a unity large\r\nenough to comprehend these various forms. If they must be\r\ndivided, let them separate later along their own lines of\r\ncleavage, not on lines extended from western nations. In one\r\nplace, I met a swarthy Asiatic who knew just enough English\r\nto be able to tell me that he was a Scotch Presbyterian. Are\r\nwe then to have a Scotch Presbyterian Church in Asia, and a\r\nCanadian Presbyterian Church, and an Australian Presbyterian\r\nChurch? Is the American Civil War forever to divide\r\ncommunities of Chinese believers into American Northern\r\nPresbyterians and American Southern Presbyterians? Why\r\nshould we force our unhappy quarrel of a generation ago\r\nupon them? The American Presbyterian Board has truly\r\ndeclared that ``the object of the foreign missionary enterprise\r\nis not to perpetuate on the mission field the denominational\r\ndistinctions of Christendom but to build up on Scriptural lines\r\nand according to Scriptural principles and methods the\r\nKingdom of Our Lord Jesus Christ.'' It has advised all its\r\nmissions that ``we encourage as far as practicable the formation\r\nof union churches in which the results of the mission\r\nwork of all allied evangelical churches should be gathered, and\r\nthat they (the missions) observe everywhere the most generous\r\nprinciples of missionary comity.'' The specific approval of\r\nthis declaration, by the General Assembly of 1900, makes this\r\nthe authoritative policy of the Presbyterian Church in the\r\nUnited States of America.\r\n\r\nIn harmony with this general position, several significant\r\nefforts towards union are being made. The first movements,\r\nnaturally, are towards a union of communions that are substantially\r\nalike in polity and doctrine. Already all the Presbyterian\r\nand Reformed Boards operating in Japan, Korea,\r\nMexico and India have joined in the support of a united native\r\nchurch in those lands, and similar movements are in progress\r\nin other lands and in several churches, notably the Protestant\r\nEpiscopal and the Methodist Episcopal. In China, the\r\nrepresentatives of the eight Presbyterian denominations of\r\nEurope and America have met in loving conference and\r\nplanned to unite all the native Christians connected with their\r\nrespective missions into one magnificent and commanding\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nAnd now unions of wholly different denominations are being\r\ndiscussed. The American Board missionaries intimated to the\r\nPresbyterian Mission in 1901 that there might be ``no inherent\r\ndifficulty in uniting the membership of the Presbyterian and\r\nCongregational churches in Chih-li in one common body.'' A\r\nsimilar question is being informally discussed by the American\r\nPresbyterian missionaries and those of the English Baptist\r\nMission in Shantung. The fellowship between the two bodies\r\nthere, as between Presbyterians and Congregationalists in\r\nChih-li, is close.\r\n\r\nThe local difficulties do not appear to be serious. An\r\nEnglish Baptist missionary frankly stated in an open conference\r\nof missionaries of various boards in Chefoo, that his mission,\r\nwith the full knowledge of the home society, took the position\r\nthat the Chinese Christians are not yet fit for congregational\r\ngovernment, being, as a rule, comparatively ignorant farmers\r\njust out of heathenism; that it had been found necessary to\r\nselect the best men in a local church and give them powers\r\nwhich, for all practical purposes, constituted them a session,\r\nand that the native church as a whole was being more and\r\nmore directed by a body consisting of representatives from such\r\nsessions. An American Board missionary told me substantially\r\nthe same thing regarding the churches of his mission. We\r\nshould not infer too much from such admissions. Both Baptists\r\nand Congregationalists are loyally attached to their independent\r\npolicy. Both referred, of course, to the temporary\r\nadaptions necessary in the present stage of mission work.\r\nAs for Presbyterians, their Board's Committee on Policy and\r\nMethods declared, March 6, 1899:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``It is inexpedient to give formal organization to churches and Presbyteries\r\nafter American models unless there is manifest need therefor, and\r\nsuch forms are shown to be best adapted to the people and circumstances.\r\nIn general, the ends of the work will be best attained by simple and\r\nflexible organizations adapted to the characteristic and real needs of the\r\npeople and designed to develop and utilize spiritual power rather than\r\nmerely or primarily to secure proper ecclesiastical procedure.''\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, neither the representative nor the independent\r\nforms of church government are yet in unmodified\r\noperation on any mission fields, except perhaps in Japan, for\r\nthe simple reason that the typical foreign missionary has thus\r\nfar necessarily exercised the functions of a superintendent or\r\nbishop of the native churches. Undoubtedly, however, the\r\nAsiatic churches are being educated to expect self-government\r\nas soon as they are competent to exercise it.\r\n\r\nDoctrinal differences may present greater difficulties. And\r\nyet there is a remarkable unanimity of teaching among the\r\nmissionaries of the various denominations in China. However\r\nwidely they may differ among themselves, nearly all agree in\r\npreaching to the Chinese the great central truths of Christianity\r\nso that most of the native Christians know little of the sectarian\r\ndistinctions that are so well-understood in America. Such\r\ndifferences as are necessary in China might be provided for by\r\nrecognizing the liberty of the local church and the individual\r\nbeliever to hold whichever phase of the truth might be preferred.\r\nThe China Inland Mission has shown that this plan\r\nis feasible. It is composed of missionaries of all Protestant\r\ndenominations, but they work in harmony and build up a\r\nChinese church by recognizing the right of brethren to differ\r\nin the same organization.\r\n\r\nDoubtless isolated cases of embarrassment would occur, but\r\nthey would be insignificant in comparison with the embarrassments\r\ninherent in sectarian divisions. Denominational uniformity\r\nis bought at bitter cost when it separates Christians\r\ninto rival camps. Unity in essentials and liberty in non-essentials\r\nare far better than a slavery to non-essentials which\r\ndestroys that oneness of believers for which our Lord prayed.\r\nIn the presence of a vast heathen population, let Christians at\r\nleast remember that their points of disagreement are less vital\r\nthan their points of agreement, that Christianity should, as far\r\nas possible, present a solid front, and let them devoutly join\r\nthe Conference of Protestant missionaries in Japan in the ringing\r\nproclamation:--``That all those who are one with Christ by\r\nfaith are one body, and that all who love the Lord Jesus and\r\nHis Church in sincerity and truth should pray and labour for\r\nthe full realization of such a corporate oneness as the Master\r\nHimself prayed for in the night in which He was betrayed.''\r\n\r\nIt is true that an advanced position on comity sometimes\r\noperates to the disadvantage of the denomination that espouses\r\nit. But let us be true to our ideals even if some whom we might\r\nhave reached do go to heaven by another route. Other\r\nchurches are preaching the gospel and those who accept it\r\nat their hands will be saved. We are in Asia to preach\r\nChrist, to preach Him as we understand Him, but if any\r\none else insists on preaching Him in a given place and\r\nwill do so with equal fidelity to His divinity and atone-\r\nment, let us cooperate with them, or federate with them, or\r\ncombine with them, or give up the field to them, as the\r\ncircumstances may require. The problem before us is not simply\r\nwhere we can do good, but where we can do the most good,\r\nhow use to the best advantage the limited resources at our\r\ncommand. Givers at home have a right to demand this.\r\nMany of their gifts involve self-sacrifice, and they should be\r\nused where a real need exists. ``There remains yet very much\r\nland to be possessed.'' I have seen enough of it to burden my\r\nheart as long as I live, toiling, sorrowing, sin-laden multitudes,\r\nwho might be better Christians than we are if they had our\r\nchance, but who are scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd.\r\nAnd shall we multiply missionaries in places already\r\noccupied and dispute as to who shall preach in a given fields\r\nwhen these millions are dying without the gospel?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V\r\nThe Future of China And Our Relation\r\nTo It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\nIS THERE A YELLOW PERIL\r\n\r\nWILL China ever be able to menace the nations of\r\nthe West? This is the startling question that many\r\nsober-minded men are asking. Some writers, indeed,\r\nmake light of the ``yellow peril,'' characterizing it ``a\r\nmere bugaboo of an excited imagination,'' because, as they\r\nallege, China has neither the organization nor the valour to\r\nfight Europe, and because, if it had, it could not transport its\r\narmy and navy so vast a distance.\r\n\r\nBut surely organization and valour can be acquired by the\r\nChinese as well as by any other people. Their present helplessness\r\nbefore the aggressive foreigner is rapidly teaching them\r\nthe necessity for the former. As for the latter, it is well known\r\nthat the most dangerous fighter is the strong but peaceably-\r\ndisposed man who has been goaded to desperation by long-\r\ncontinued insult and injustice. Americans may discreetly remember\r\nthat they themselves were once sneeringly described\r\nas ``a nation of shopkeepers who wouldn't and couldn't\r\nfight.''\r\n\r\nIt is easy to be deceived by the result of the China-Japan\r\nWar of 1894. The Japanese were successful, not because they\r\nare abler, but because they had more swiftly responded to the\r\ntouch of the modern world and had organized their government,\r\ntheir army and their navy in accordance with scientific\r\nmethods. More bulky and phlegmatic China was caught napping\r\nby her enterprising enemy. Despising the profession of\r\narms, China gave her energies to scholarship and commerce,\r\nand filled her regiments and ships with paupers, criminals and\r\nopium fiends, who were as destitute of courage, intelligence\r\nand patriotism as the darky who explained his flight from the\r\nbattle-field by saying that he would rather be a live coward\r\nthan a dead hero. As for the men above them, a Chinese officer\r\nadmitted to a friend of mine that at the outbreak of the\r\nwar with Japan, the army contractors bought a lot of old rifles\r\nin Germany, which had long before been discarded as worthless\r\nby the German army, paying two ounces of silver for each\r\ngun, and thriftily charging the Government nine ounces. Then\r\nthey bought a cargo of cartridges that did not fit the guns and\r\nthat had been lying in damp cellars for twenty years, and put\r\nthe whole equipment into the hands of raw recruits commanded\r\nby opium-smokers.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that the Chinese were worsted\r\nbefore the onset of the wide-awake Japanese, and that the\r\nunorganized mobs with which they blindly tried to drive out\r\nforeigners in 1900 were easily crushed by the armies of the\r\nWest. But it would be folly to imagine that this is the end.\r\nIt takes a nation of 426,000,000 phlegmatic people longer to\r\nget under way than a nation of 43,000,000 nervous people,\r\nbut when they do get started, their momentum is proportionately\r\ngreater. China has plenty of men who can fight, and\r\nwhen they are well commanded, they make as good soldiers as\r\nthere are in the world, as ``Chinese Gordon'' showed. Was\r\nnot his force called the ``Ever Victorious Army,'' because it\r\nwas never defeated? Did not Lord Charles Beresford, of the\r\nEnglish navy, say, after personal inspection of many of the\r\ntroops of China:--``I am convinced that properly armed, disciplined\r\nand led, there could be no better material than the\r\nChinese soldiers''? Did not Admiral Dewey report that the\r\nfifty Chinese who served under him in the battle of Manila Bay\r\nfought so magnificently that they proved themselves equal in\r\ncourage to American sailors and that they should be made\r\nAmerican citizens by special enactment? During my tour of\r\nAsia, I saw the soldiers of England, France, Germany, Italy,\r\nAustria, Belgium, Russia, America and Japan. But the Chinese\r\ncavalrymen of Governor Yuan Shih Kai, whom I have described\r\nelsewhere,[89] were as fine troops as I saw anywhere.\r\nThey would be a foe not to be despised. When Bishop Potter\r\nreturned from his tour of Asia, he declared that ``when Japan\r\nhas taught China the art of war, neither England nor Russia\r\nnor Germany will decide the fate of the East.''\r\n\r\n\r\n[89] Chapter VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is odd that any intelligent person should suppose that distance\r\nis an effectual barrier against an aroused and organized\r\nAsia. It is no farther from China to Europe than from Europe\r\nto China, and Europe has not found the distance a barrier to\r\nits designs on China. England, Germany, France, Russia,\r\nand even little Holland and Portugal, have all managed to\r\nsend ships and troops to the Far East, to seize territory and to\r\nsubjugate the inhabitants. Why should it be deemed impossible\r\nfor China, which alone is larger than all these nations\r\ncombined, to do what they have done?\r\n\r\nThe absorption of China by Russia or any other single European\r\npower is not possible for the reason that the attempt\r\nwould be resisted by all the other Powers, including the United\r\nStates and Japan. The world will never permit one of its\r\nnations to make China what Great Britain has made India. A\r\nhalf dozen Powers are determined to have a share if the break\r\nup comes.\r\n\r\nThe real partition of the Empire, however, is hardly probable\r\nas the case stands to-day. The Powers dread the task of\r\nadministering a population that is not only huge but of such a\r\nstubborn character that enormous military expenditures might\r\nbe required to prevent constant rebellions. A still more potent\r\nreason lies in the fact that the European nations that covet\r\nportions of China could not agree among themselves as to the\r\ndivision of the spoil. There is, indeed, apparent acquiescence\r\nin Russian influence in Manchuria, German in Shantung,\r\nBritish in the valleys of the Yang-tze and the Pearl, and French\r\nin Tonquin. But no one nation is quite satisfied with this\r\ndivision. Each has thus far taken what it could get; but Germany,\r\nFrance and Russia are far from pleased to see Great\r\nBritain take the lion's share that she has marked out for herself.\r\nMoreover, there are important provinces that are now\r\ncommon ground, like the imperial province of Chih-li, or\r\nunappropriated, like several of the interior provinces. Actual\r\npartition would mean a scramble that would precipitate a general\r\nwar, and such a war would involve so many uncertainties\r\nnot only as to the result in China but as to possible readjustments\r\nin Europe itself, that the Powers wisely shrink from it.\r\nSo they prefer for the present, at least, the policy of ``spheres\r\nof influence'' as giving them a commercial foothold and political\r\ninfluence with less risk of trouble.\r\n\r\nBesides, Great Britain, the United States and Japan are all\r\nopposed to partition. England's chief interest in China is\r\ncommercial, and it quite naturally prefers to trade with the\r\nwhole of China rather than be confined to a particular section\r\nof it, for it knows that there would be little trade with any\r\nparts of China that Russia, France and Germany absolutely\r\ncontrolled. So England insists on the integrity of China and\r\nthe open door.''\r\n\r\nThe United States has the same commercial interest in this\r\nrespect as Great Britain, with the added motive that partition\r\nwould give her nothing at all in China; while Japan feels the\r\nmost strongly of all for she has both the reasons that actuate\r\nthe United States and also the vital one of self-preservation.\r\nThe Hon. Chester Holcombe says that several years ago, in an\r\ninterview with an influential member of the Japanese Cabinet\r\nin Tokio, the conversation turned upon the aggressions of\r\nEuropean Powers and the weakness of Korea, which had\r\nrecently declared its independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n``The Japanese Minister was greatly disturbed at the prospect for the\r\nfuture. He insisted that the action taken by Korea, under the guidance\r\nof China, would not save that little kingdom from attack and absorption.\r\nHolding up one hand, and separating the first and second fingers as widely\r\nas possible from the third and fourth, he said:--`Here is the situation.\r\nThose four fingers represent the four great European Powers, Great\r\nBritain, Germany, France and Russia. In the open space between them\r\nlie Japan, China and Korea.' Then, with really dramatic force, he added:\r\n`Like the jaws of a huge vise, those fingers are slowly closing, and unless\r\nsome supreme effort is made, they will certainly crush the national life out\r\nof all three.' ''\r\n\r\n\r\nSo Japan must be reckoned with in any plans which the\r\nwestern nations may make for China, and that Japan is a\r\nfactor not to be despised, the Russians have learned to their\r\nsorrow. Japan believes that she has found the way to make\r\nher opposition so formidable that all Europe cannot overcome it.\r\nBeyond any other people in the world, the Chinese furnish the\r\nraw materials for a world power. All they need is capable\r\nleadership. This is the gigantic task to which Japan has set\r\nherself. The alert and enterprising Islanders have entered\r\nupon a career of national aggrandizement. They realize that\r\nwith their limited territory and population, they can hardly\r\nhope to become a power of the first class and make headway\r\nagainst the tremendous forces of western nations unless they can\r\nally themselves with their larger continental neighbour. They\r\nclearly see their own superiority in organization, discipline and\r\nmodern spirit, and they see also the stupendous power of China\r\nif it can be aroused and effectively directed. The Japanese\r\nhave never been accused of undue modesty and they firmly\r\nbelieve that they are just the people to do this work. This is\r\nnot simply because they are ambitious, but because they see\r\nthat unless Asia can be thus solidified against Europe, the\r\nwhole mighty continent will fall under the control of the white\r\nmen who already dominate so large a part of it. Accordingly\r\nthe Japanese have entered upon the definite policy of not only\r\nabsorbing Korea, but of cultivating the closest possible alliance\r\nwith their former foe.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Augustin Heard, formerly United States Minister\r\nto Korea, represents Japan as whispering to the sorely beset\r\nCelestials:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``Why shouldn't we work together? I hate the foreigner as much as\r\nyou do, and should be as glad to get rid of him. Together we can do\r\ngreat things; separate we are feeble. I am too small, and you are, so to\r\nspeak, too big. You are unorganized. Let us join hands and I will do\r\nwhat I can to help you get ready; and when we are ready we will drive\r\nthese insolent fellows into the sea. I have a big army and navy and I\r\nhave learned all the foreigners have to teach. This knowledge I will pass\r\non to you. We have great advantages over them. In the first place they\r\nare a long way from their supplies, and every move they make costs a\r\ngreat deal of money. Our men can fight as well as theirs, if they are\r\nshown how, and there are a great many more of them. They can march\r\nas well, will require to carry almost no baggage, and do not cost half as\r\nmuch to feed. Our wounded men, too, in their own country and climate\r\nwill get well, while theirs will die.''\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this suggestion China listens and ponders:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``What are the objections? There is, first, the contempt which our\r\npeople feel for them; but that is rapidly dying out. The Japanese\r\nshowed in our last war that small men can fight as well as big ones; and\r\na rifle in the hands of the small man will carry as far and as true as in the\r\nhands of a larger one. Then, when we have once got rid of the foreigner\r\nwill Japan not try to keep the leadership and supremacy? Very likely\r\nbut then we shall be armed and organized; we have as able men as they\r\nand with our overwhelming numbers shall we not be capable of holding\r\nour own--nay, if we wish, of taking possession of her?''[90]\r\n\r\n[90] Article in The New York Tribune, September 7, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly this imaginary conversation voices the ambition\r\nof the Japanese and the inclination of an increasing number of\r\nChinese. At any rate, the possibilities which such an alliance\r\nsuggests are almost overwhelming. Japan undoubtedly has the\r\nintelligence and the executive ability to organize as no other\r\npower could the vast latent forces of China. If any one\r\ndoubts her fitness to discipline and lead, he might obtain some\r\nheartfelt information from the Russians. Says Mr. George\r\nLynch in the Nineteenth Century:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``I know of no movement more pregnant with possibilities than this\r\nnow in progress which makes towards the Japanization of China. There\r\nwill be great changes in the government and life of that great Empire just\r\nas soon as the Empress Dowager dies, and she is now an old woman. In\r\nthe upheaval of change, if the industrious, persistent, far-sighted efforts of\r\nher neighbours bear fruit, we may witness quite a rapid transformation in\r\nthe life of the Empire. That clever conspirator, Sen Yat Sen, said to me\r\nthat, once the Chinese made up their minds to change, they would effect\r\nin fifteen years as much as it has taken Japan thirty to accomplish. There\r\nare some men in the East who affect to regard this rapprochement between\r\nJapan and China with alarm, as carrying in its development the menace\r\nof a really genuine `yellow peril.' ''\r\n\r\n\r\nIt certainly needs no argument to prove that if the 426,000,000\r\nChinese are once fairly committed to the skillful leadership\r\nof the Japanese, a force will be set in motion which could\r\nbe withstood only by the united efforts of all the rest of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe task to which Japan has set herself, however, will not be\r\neasily achieved. To say nothing of other nations, the Russians\r\nare not at all disposed to sit quietly by while their foes cajole\r\nthe Chinese. Russia has some designs of her own on China.\r\nHalf Asiatic and semi-barbarous herself, past master in all the\r\narts of Oriental diplomacy, patient, stubborn and untroubled\r\nby scruples, she is a formidable competitor for the leadership\r\nof China. In Persia, the Russian political policy works largely\r\nthrough the missionaries of the Greek Church, whose propaganda\r\nis political as well as religious. The same tactics are\r\nnow being employed in China. The Chih-li correspondent of\r\nthe North China Herald reports that the Holy Russian branch\r\nof the Greek Church is becoming suspiciously active in North\r\nChina.\r\n\r\n\r\n``Their work is spreading, and the methods adopted are such as to attract\r\nall the worst characters of the districts in which they operate. In a\r\nlittle town near the Great Wall, where in June there were about a dozen\r\nconverts to the Greek Church, there are now over eighty. Any and all\r\nare welcome. Their families no less than the men themselves are reck-\r\noned as belonging to the Church. The priest has made a round of several\r\ntowns, and, though he speaks no Chinese, by unhesitatingly giving protection\r\nand assistance in any case of dispute or litigation, he has made it\r\nclearly evident that for any man in any way under a cloud there is nothing\r\nbetter than to join the Greek Church.... The impression\r\namong European onlookers is that Russia is preparing to extend her arms\r\nover Chih-li, and is beginning to smooth her way by gaining over the people\r\nin the eastern marches of the province. It is a significant fact that the\r\nGreek Church is known among the people as a `Kuo Chiao' (National\r\nChurch), a charge from which the Protestants are considered to be entirely,\r\nand the Roman Catholics partially, free.''\r\n\r\nChina, moreover, will be slow to respond to the overtures of\r\nJapan, partly because her bulk and phlegmatic disposition and\r\nlack of public spirit make it difficult for her to act quickly and\r\nunitedly in anything, partly because Chinese pride and prejudice\r\nwill not easily yield to the leadership of the haughty little\r\nisland whose people as well as whose territory have long been\r\ncontemptuously regarded as dwarfish and inferior.\r\n\r\nBut the shrewd Japanese are making more progress than is\r\ncommonly supposed. Not only have they already obtained the\r\ngreat island of Formosa, but they have for years been quietly\r\nmaking their commercial interests paramount in Korea. Their\r\nfirst move in the war with Russia was to occupy that strategic\r\npeninsula with a large military force and to secure a treaty with\r\nthe Emperor which gives Japan a virtual protectorate over the\r\nLand of the Morning Calm. The promise to respect the independence\r\nof Korea of course deceives no one. It is probably\r\nsincere, as diplomatic promises go; but he is innocent indeed\r\nwho imagines that Korea will be free to do anything that Japan\r\ndisapproves. The freedom will doubtless be of the kind that\r\nCuba enjoys--a freedom which gives large liberty in matters\r\nof internal administration, which relieves the protecting country\r\nof any trouble or responsibility that it may deem inconvenient,\r\nbut which does not permit any alliance with a third\r\nnation, and which, for all important international purposes, especially\r\nof a military character, regards the ``independent''\r\nnation as really dependent. It is quite safe to predict that no\r\nEuropean power will be unsophisticated enough to assume that\r\nKorea is ``a free and independent nation.'' The arrangement\r\nwill be in every way to the advantage of the Koreans, who have\r\nsuffered grievously from the pulling and hauling of contending\r\npowers and from many evils from which the abler and wiser\r\nJapanese will, in a measure at least, protect them.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, too, the Japanese have been strengthening\r\nthe ties which bind them to China. The brainy Japanese\r\ncan be seen to-day in almost all the leading cities of the Middle\r\nKingdom. There is a Japanese colony of 200 souls in\r\nChefoo and of 1,400 in Tien-tsin. Already the Japanese are\r\nadvising China's government, reorganizing her army, drafting\r\nher laws and teaching in her university. Even more distant\r\ncountries are not beyond the range of their ambition. The\r\nleaders of India, restive under British rule, are beginning to\r\nlook with eager sympathy to Japan as the rising Asiatic power.\r\nEven the Grand Vizier of Persia has paid a state visit to Japan.\r\nAny hopes of India and Persia are likely to be vain, for Britain\r\nhas a hold upon the former and Russia upon the latter which\r\nit would be Quixotic in the Japanese to attempt to break. The\r\nIslanders are not fools. But the Siamese, helplessly exasperated\r\nby the encroachments of the French, would doubtless be\r\nglad enough to enter into an alliance with Japan and China.\r\nIn 1902, the Crown Prince of Siam visited Japan, where he\r\nwas most graciously welcomed, and increasing numbers of Japanese\r\nwho know what they are about are obtaining increasing\r\ninfluence in the Land of the White Elephant.\r\n\r\nNor is it simply by sending Japanese to neighbouring countries\r\nthat Japan is extending her power. She is encouraging\r\nChinese students to come to her shores. Dr. David S. Spencer\r\nof Japan declares that 300 Chinese are studying the art of\r\nwar in Japanese barracks. Dr. Sydney L. Gulick says that\r\n5,000 Chinese are being trained in the schools of Japan for\r\npositions of future power in their own country. It is significant that\r\nViceroy Yuan Shih Kai, the ablest and most far-seeing statesman\r\nin China, is reported in the telegraphic despatches of\r\nFebruary 5, 1904, as having memorialized the Throne in favour\r\nof an offensive and defensive alliance with Japan to regain\r\nManchuria from the Russians, while the North China Daily\r\nNews represents Prince Su, Prince Ching, Na Tung, President\r\nof the Wai-wu-pu, and Tieh Liang as in favour of the same\r\npolicy. Mr. Holcombe is of the opinion that ``the brightest\r\nspot in the outlook for China is in the increasing probability of alliance\r\nand affiliation with Japan. . . . Together these two\r\ngreat nations of the Far East may, and it is confidently hoped\r\nwill, safely confront those Governments whose schemes are hostile\r\nto both, and prove their right to manage their own affairs\r\nand determine their own destinies.''[91]\r\n\r\n\r\n[91] Article in The Outlook, February 13, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut whatever the immediate future may be, it is not probable\r\nthat so huge and virile a population as the Chinese will be\r\npermanently led by a foreign nation. Even if partition should\r\ncome, it would only hasten the development of those teeming\r\nmillions of people, for foreign domination would mean more\r\nrailway, telegraph and steamship lines. It would mean the\r\nopening of mines, the development of the press, the complete\r\nascendency of Western ideas. Though China as a political organism\r\nmight be divided, the Chinese people would remain--\r\nthe most virile, industrious, untiring people of Asia, and perhaps,\r\nafter due tutelage, a coming power of the world. China's\r\nassimilative power is enormous. The black man may be dominated\r\nby the white and the Hindu by the English, but China is\r\nneither Africa nor India. It is true that the present dynasty is\r\nManchu, but the Manchus are more akin to the Chinese than\r\neither the Russians or the Japanese. Moreover the Manchus\r\nhave not tried to rule China from the outside, but have permanently\r\nsettled in China, and while they have succeeded as a\r\nrule in maintaining a separate name, they have not made the\r\nChinese Manchus, but instead they have themselves been prac-\r\ntically merged into the engulfing mass of China. ``Those who\r\nimagine that the vast population of the Empire will submit\r\nquietly to the partition of their country, or that any military\r\nforce of moderate size could force it to acquiesce in such a\r\nscheme, know but little of the Chinese character, of their intense\r\nlove of country, or of their unconquerable tenacity of\r\npurpose.''[92] The foreign nation that gets the Chinese, or even\r\nany considerable portion of them, will probably find that it has\r\nassumed a burden in comparison with which the Egyptian\r\ntrouble with the Israelites was insignificant, and it is not\r\nimprobable that the conqueror will some day find himself\r\nconquered.\r\n\r\n\r\n[92] Chester Holcombe, article in The Outlook, February 13, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt any rate, portentous possibilities are conjured up by the\r\ncontemplation of this mighty nation! There are upheavals\r\ncompared with which our revolutions are but spasms. There\r\nare religions whose adherents outnumber ours two to one.\r\nThere is a civilization which was old before ours was born.\r\nAre we to believe that these swarming legions were created for\r\nno purpose? Are their generations to appear and fall and rot\r\nunnoticed, like the leaves of the forest? Degraded, superstitious,\r\nmany of them still are. But they need only to be organized\r\nand directed to do untold mischief. More than once\r\nalready has a similar catastrophe occurred. Some prodigy of\r\nskill and genius has seized such enormous forces, given them\r\ndiscipline and coherency and hurled them like a thunderbolt\r\nupon Christendom. Sometimes the shock has been frightful,\r\nand before it the proudest of empires and the stateliest of\r\ninstitutions have reeled and fallen. This was the Titan-like\r\nachievement of Alaric, of Genseric, of Attila, and of Mohammed.\r\nYet Goths and Vandals, Huns and Mohammedans,\r\ncombined, had not half the numbers upon which we now look.\r\nGive the 426,000,000 Chinese the results of modern discovery\r\nand invention, and imagination falters. They have the territory.\r\nThey have the resources. They have the population\r\nand they are now acquiring the knowledge. China will fight\r\nno more like the barbarians of old with spears and bows and\r\narrows, for despite the treaty of 1900 prohibiting the importation\r\nof arms, the Chinese are buying repeating rifles and Maxim\r\nguns, while in their own arsenals they are turning out vast\r\nquantities of munitions of war. The American consul at Leipsic,\r\nGermany, reports to the State Department that an Austrian\r\ncompany has just received an order for so large a number of\r\nsmall arms for the Chinese Government that it will take several\r\nyears to fill it, even with additional forces of men to whom it\r\nhas given employment. This is only one of many reports\r\nreceived in Washington within recent months that the factories\r\nof both Germany and Austria are busy supplying the Chinese\r\nwith modern arms and ammunition. The armies of China\r\nwill soon be as well equipped as the armies of Europe.\r\n\r\nIncredible as it may seem, up to the year 1901, promotion\r\nin the army was often determined by trials of strength with\r\nstone weights, dexterity in sword exercises and skill in the use\r\nof the bow and arrow. But in that year, an Imperial Decree\r\ndeclared that such tests ``have no relation to strategy and to\r\nthat military science which is indispensable for military officers,''\r\ncommanded that they be abolished and that military\r\nacademies should be established in the provincial capitals in\r\nwhich the science of modern war should be diligently studied.\r\nNot content with this, forty young men were sent to Europe\r\nin 1903 for the express purpose of studying the latest military\r\nand naval methods of the white man. And now Sir Robert\r\nHart proposes not only a reorganization of China's civil service\r\nbut the building of a first-class navy of thirty battleships and\r\ncruisers, and he thinks that the enormous sum of $200,000,000\r\na year can be obtained for this purpose by an increase in the\r\nland tax. Then, he declares, China will be enabled ``not\r\nonly to make her voice heard, but to take an effective share in\r\nthe settlement of questions in the Far East.'' The London\r\nTimes rather contemptuously asserts that ``the entire project\r\nin its present shape is visionary from beginning to end.''\r\nBut Sir Robert Hart has spent fifty years in China, having\r\nentered the British consular service in 1854 and become\r\nInspector-General of Maritime Customs in 1863. During the\r\ngreater part of this long period, he has been an adviser of\r\nthe Chinese Government and the most influential foreigner in\r\nthe Empire. The recommendation of such a man is not to be\r\nlightly dismissed as ``visionary,'' especially when it is made to\r\na people who have been taught by bitter experience that a\r\nmodern armament is their only hope of defense against the\r\nforeigner. As late as the beginning of the year 1904, Russia\r\nridiculed the idea that Japan could do anything against a\r\nwestern power, and all the rest of Europe as well as America,\r\nwhile admiring the pluck of the Japanese, confidently expected\r\nthem to be crushed by the Slav. Wise men will think twice in\r\nthe future before they sneer at the yellow race. If Japan in\r\nhalf a century could go from junks and cloisonne to battleships\r\nand magazine rifles, and to the handling of them, too,\r\nmore scientifically and effectively than they were ever handled\r\nby a white man, why should it be deemed chimerical that China,\r\nwith equal ability and greater resources and certainly no less\r\nprovocation, should in time achieve even vaster results, particularly\r\nas Japan is not only willing but eager to teach her? ``We\r\ndo not lack either men of intellect or brilliant talents, capable\r\nof learning and doing anything they please; but their movements\r\nhave hitherto been hampered by old prejudices,'' said\r\nthe Emperor Kuang Hsii. Precisely, and the stern, relentless\r\npressure of necessity is now shattering some of those ``old\r\nprejudices.'' ``You urge us to move faster,'' said a Chinese\r\nmagistrate to a foreigner. ``We are slow to respond for we\r\nare a conservative people; but if you force us to start, we may\r\nmove faster and farther than you like.''\r\n\r\nSome things may yet occur undreampt of in all our philosophy.\r\nWe observe the changing march of world powers,\r\nthe majestic procession in which the pomp and glitter of\r\nthrones are mingled with the tears and blood of calamity\r\nand war. What a pageant! Yesterday, Chaldea, Egypt, Assyria,\r\nBabylon, Persia, Greece, Rome! To-day, England,\r\nGermany, Russia, Japan, the United States! To-morrow,\r\nwhat? What, indeed, if not some of these now awakening\r\nnations! It is by no means impossible that some new\r\nJenghiz Khan or Tamerlane may arise, and with the weapons\r\nof modern warfare in his hands, and these uncounted millions\r\nat his command, gaze about on the pygmies that we call the\r\nPowers! Christendom has too long regarded heathen nations\r\nwith a pity not unmingled with contempt. It is now beginning\r\nto regard them with a respect not unmingled with fear.\r\nThere is not a statesman in Europe to-day who is not troubled\r\nwith dire forebodings regarding these teeming hordes, that appear\r\nto be just awakening from the torpor of ages, and some\r\nthoughtful observers fear that a movement has already begun\r\nwhich will lead to great wars whose issue no man can foresee,\r\nand to stupendous reconstructions of the map of the\r\nworld. The Emperor of Germany has painted a picture which\r\nhas startled not so much by its art as by its meaning. ``On a\r\nprojecting rock, illuminated by a shining cross, stand the allegorical\r\nfigures of the civilized nations. At the feet of this\r\nrocky eminence lies the wide plain of European culture, from\r\nwhich rise countless cities and the steeples and spires of\r\nchurches of every denomination. But ominous clouds are\r\ngathering over this peaceful landscape. A stifling gloom\r\no'erspreads the sky. The glare of burning cities lights up the\r\nroad by which the barbaric hordes of Asia are approaching.\r\nThe Archangel Michael points to the fearsome foe, waving the\r\nnations on to do battle in a sacred cause. Underneath are\r\nthe words--`Peoples of Europe, keep guard over your most\r\nsacred treasures!' ''\r\n\r\nMaking all due allowance for the exuberance of Emperor\r\nWilliam's imagination, the fact remains that his picture represents\r\nthe thought that is uppermost to-day in the minds of the\r\nworld's thinkers. All see that the next few decades are big\r\nwith possibilities of peril.\r\n\r\n ``The rudiments of Empire here\r\n   Are plastic yet and warm,\r\n The chaos of a mighty world\r\n   Is rounding into form.''\r\n\r\n\r\nOne thinks instinctively of the words of Isaiah: ``The\r\nnoise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people;\r\na tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered\r\ntogether; the Lord of hosts mustereth the hosts of the battle.''\r\nPlainly, the overshadowing problem of the present age is the\r\nrelation of China to the world's future. Whether recent events\r\nhave lessened the danger, we shall see in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\nFRESH REASON TO HATE THE FOREIGNER\r\n\r\nOF course, the victorious march of the Allies upon\r\nPeking, the capture of the city, the flight of the\r\nEmperor and the Empress Dowager and the humiliating\r\nterms of peace taught the Chinese anew their helplessness before\r\nthe modern equipment of western nations and the necessity\r\nof learning the methods of the white man if they were ever\r\nto hold their own against him. But defeat, while always hard\r\nto bear, does not always embitter the conquered against the\r\nconqueror. On the contrary, there are evidences that the\r\nChinese respect and like the Japanese far more since they were\r\nsoundly whipped by them in 1894 and 1895. In considering,\r\ntherefore, the effect upon the Chinese of the suppression of the\r\nBoxer uprising, we must bear in mind not so much the fact of\r\nvictory by the Allies as the treatment which they accorded their\r\nprostrate foe. Was that treatment dignified and just? Did\r\nthe soldiers of alleged Christian nations behave with the sobriety\r\nand fairness which so eminently characterized the Japanese\r\ntroops after the China-Japan War? Have the Chinese reason\r\nto regard foreigners in the future as men who will sternly\r\npunish injustice and treachery, but who are at the same time as\r\nmoral and humane and trustworthy as might be reasonably expected\r\nof the representatives of a higher civilization and a\r\npurer religion? For answer, let us turn to the conduct of the\r\nallied armies, led by experienced officers of high rank and\r\nworking in harmony with diplomatic officials who were supposed\r\nto incarnate the spirit and methods of the most enlightened\r\nnations of the earth. The testimony of witnesses will be\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Arthur H. Smith, who was in Peking at the time,\r\nwrites:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``Bating all exaggerations, it remains true that scores of walled cities\r\nhave been visited by armed bodies of foreign soldiers, the district magistrate--\r\nand sometimes the Prefect--held up and bullied to force him to\r\npay a large sum of money, with no other reason than the imperative demand\r\nand the threat of dire consequences on refusal. In one case the\r\nRussians kidnapped the Prefect of Yung-ping-fu and carried him off to Port\r\nArthur. At Ting-chou the French did the same to the sub-prefect, the only\r\nenergetic magistrate in all that region, bearing him in triumph to Paoting-fu\r\nand leaving the district to Boxers and to chaos. At Tsang-chou\r\nthe Germans came in force, looted the yamen of General Mei, the only\r\nChinese officer of rank who had been constantly fighting and destroying\r\nBoxers for nearly a year, drove him away and released all the Boxer\r\nprisoners in the jails of the city, plundering the yamen of the friendly and\r\nefficient sub-prefect who had saved the lives of the foreign families close\r\nby the city. Is it any wonder that General Mei complained that s on eight\r\nsides he had no face left.' . . . The robbery of Chinese on the way\r\nhome with the avails of their day's work has been systematically carried\r\non by some of the soldiers from Christian lands. Even foreigners are\r\n`held up' on the street by drunken soldiers, and it is becoming necessary\r\nnever to go out without one's revolver--a weapon generally quite superfluous\r\nin almost any part of China.''\r\n\r\n\r\nBishop D. H. Moore, of the Methodist Church, who hurried\r\nto Peking as soon as the way was open, wrote:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``You can hardly form any conception of the exposure and hardships\r\nunder any but the American and Japanese flags. The English have\r\nscarcely any but the Sikhs, who are lustful and lootful to a degree. The\r\nRussians are brutal and the Germans deserve their reputation for brutality.\r\nWith Lowry and Hobart, I responded to the agonizing appeal of a husband\r\nto drive out a German corporal who, on duty and armed, had run\r\nhim off and was mistreating his wife. The instance is but one of hundreds\r\nof daily occurrence. The French are very devils at this sort of outrage.\r\nOn the advance to Peking, beyond Tung-chou, they found married families--\r\nmen, women and children--cowering in barges on the canal and\r\nvolleyed into them. Every man, every cart, every boat must fly a flag.\r\nCoolies are cruelly impressed and often cruelly mistreated. The great\r\nChristian nations of the world are being represented in China by robbing,\r\nraping, looting soldiery. This is part of China's punishment; but what\r\nwill she think of Christianity? Of course, our soldiers are the best behaved;\r\nbut there are desperate characters in every army.''\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Frank Brinkley, the editor of the Japan Weekly\r\nMail, penned the following indignant paragraph:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``It sends a thrill of horror through every white man's bosom to learn\r\nthat forty missionary women and twenty-five little children were butchered\r\nby the Boxers. But in Tung-chou alone, a city where the Chinese made\r\nno resistance and where there was no fighting, 573 Chinese women of the\r\nupper classes committed suicide rather than survive the indignities they\r\nhad suffered. Women of the lower classes fared similarly at the hands of\r\nthe soldiers, but were not unwilling to survive their shame. With what\r\nshow of consistency is the Occident to denounce the barbarity of the Chinese,\r\nwhen Occidental soldiers go to China and perpetrate the very acts\r\nwhich constitute the very basis of barbarity?''\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I asked the Rev. Dr. D. Z. Sheffield, for many years\r\na missionary of the American Board in Tung-chou, whether\r\nthis statement was accurate, he replied that it was not only true,\r\nbut that it was an understatement of the truth.\r\n\r\nFay Chi Ho, an intelligent and reliable Chinese Christian,\r\ngives the following account of what he personally saw:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``I travelled with a British convoy going by boat, occupying quarters\r\non a Major's boat with his Sikh soldiers and cook. I know that the\r\nMajor was not a Christian man, for he smoked and drank all day long\r\nand was constantly cursing, striking and kicking his men, especially his\r\ncook. He also gave his orders in loud tones, with fierce mien and glaring\r\neyes, and we all feared him exceedingly. Every day at noon the\r\nMajor would take four Sikhs and go to villages several miles from the\r\nriver for loot, always compelling me to accompany him as interpreter.\r\nHe would catch the first man whom he saw in a village and compel him\r\nto act as guide to the homes of the rich. So successful was he on these\r\nraids that by the time he reached Tung-chou, he had three new carts,\r\nthree donkeys, five or six sheep, and much clothing and bric-a-brac.\r\n\r\n``One day about noon, we reached a village from which most of the\r\npeople had fled, and entering a home of wealth found there only a man\r\nabout fifty or sixty years old who received us very courteously. Immedi-\r\nately the Major demanded money, and the old man replied that though\r\nhe had money it was not at hand. The Major then commanded his soldiers\r\nto bind him, while he himself went into the house to search for money.\r\nHe found several weapons, among them a revolver and a sword with a\r\nred scarf bound on the handle. So he insisted that the old man must be\r\na Boxer, and shot him with his own hand as he lay bound. As usual he\r\nimpressed ten or more young men in the village to carry his loot, then\r\ncompelled the strongest of them to remain and drag his boats....\r\nLater, my brother told me in detail how some Sikhs had come to the village\r\none day, and, seizing him and several neighbours, had tied a rope to\r\ntheir queues, then stringing them together like mules, with men leading in\r\nfront and driving behind, had taken them to the river bank to drag boats.\r\nMy brother had never done such work before. Wading in mud and\r\nwater, sometimes up to his waist, with the whip lash to urge him on, he\r\nhad dragged until nightfall, and then, not being allowed to sleep on the\r\nboat, had lain down on the wet river bank.''[93]\r\n\r\n\r\n[93] ``Two Heroes of Cathay,'' pp. 154, 155, 158.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring my own visit in north China in the summer of 1901, I\r\nvisited the hospital of the London Mission in Tien-tsin, immortalized\r\nby John Kenneth Mackenzie. I found that it was being\r\nused as a hospital for British soldiers who were suffering\r\nfrom venereal diseases. What a spectacle for the Chinese!\r\nWhat a coarse travesty of the religion of the pure Nazarene\r\nthat the land from which the great British missionary came\r\nshould crowd with foul white men the hospital that he had built\r\nwith faith and love and prayer! In the same city, the fine\r\nY. M. C. A. building was almost deserted by the Chinese because\r\nit was so situated that to reach it they would have to pass\r\nthrough the Taku Road in the Foreign Settlement, a street\r\nwhich was a cesspool of vice, lined with saloons, dance halls\r\nand gambling hells, and its sidewalks so crowded with fast\r\nwomen--French, German, American and Japanese--and with\r\ndrunken, quarrelling foreign soldiers, that no respectable Chinese,\r\nor for that matter no decent foreign woman, could traverse\r\nit without fear of insult or abuse.\r\n\r\nIn Peking for several months after the relief of the legations,\r\neven respectable American ladies, to say nothing of Chinese\r\nwomen, could not prudently ride out except in closed carts, so\r\ngreat was the probability of indignity at the hands of foreign\r\nsoldiers; while at the entrance of famous palaces, the ``public\r\nis politely requested not to kick the Chinese attendants because\r\nthey decline to open doors which they are forbidden to unlock''\r\n--a request that the conduct of foreigners had shown to\r\nbe far from unnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn the pillaging of property, savages could not have been\r\nmore lawless than the white men from ``the highly civilized\r\nnations of the West.''\r\n\r\n\r\n``It is not literally true that every house in Peking was looted. There\r\nwere some places in obscure alleys, and in many of the innumerable and almost\r\nimpenetrable cul-de-sacs with which the capital abounds, that escaped.\r\nBut persistent inquiry appears to leave no doubt of the fact that practically\r\nevery yamen in the city has been rummaged, and practically there is nothing\r\nleft of the contents of any of them.''[94]\r\n\r\n\r\n[94] North China Daily News.\r\n\r\n\r\nWords fail me to describe the beauties of the famous Summer\r\nPalace outside the city. With its gardens, temples, pagodas,\r\nbridges, lotus-ponds, statues, colonnades, walks and\r\ndrives, it would do credit to the most highly civilized nation\r\nof Europe. A barbarous people could never have made such\r\na paradise. The British and French in 1860 burned a considerable\r\npart of it, but the enclosure is so vast (twelve square\r\nmiles) and the buildings are so numerous that the destroyed\r\nsection appears almost insignificant. Within the grounds is a\r\nbeautiful lake, fed by great springs and bordered by temples\r\nand avenues of trees and the yellow-roofed palaces of the\r\nEmperor, while near by rise the Western Hills.\r\n\r\nThis Palace is the favourite residence of the Empress Dowager\r\nand she spends long summers there. Here, too, the Emperor\r\nloves to come during the heated term and both have\r\nfollowed the example of their imperial predecessors in lavishing\r\ngreat sums upon its adornment.\r\n\r\nAfter the siege the Russians occupied it at first, and when\r\nthey left, the British and Italians took possession. Between\r\nthe three so little was left that I found devastation reigning in\r\nthat once splendidly-furnished Palace. All the rare and costly\r\nbric-a-brac had been carried away, the mirrors had been broken\r\nand the permanent ornaments defaced. A noble bronze statue\r\nof Buddha, in the temple crowning the summit of the hill, was\r\nlying ignominiously on the floor among a pile of debris, one\r\ndark hand stiffly pointing into the air. In a stately pavilion, I\r\nsaw two superb golden statues of Buddha standing upright and\r\nlooking unusually dignified, but on going behind them, I found\r\nthat great holes had been punched in their backs.\r\n\r\nEven the places dedicated to science and religion were not\r\nspared. At the celebrated Astronomical Observatory not an\r\ninstrument was left. Every one had been carried off by the\r\norders of men high in authority at the French and German\r\nLegations, and the whole place was totally wrecked. What\r\npossible excuse could there have been for destroying a place for\r\nstudying the heavens? At the Examination Grounds, consecrated\r\nfor centuries to learning and memorable for the myriads\r\nof China's brightest men who have there demonstrated their\r\nfitness, according to China's methods, for high preferment--at\r\nthese Examination Grounds, most of the 8,500 cells had been\r\nstripped of their woodwork to cook the rations of the European\r\narmies, roofs had been torn off and even stone walls had been\r\ninjured in sheer wantonness.\r\n\r\nThe Temple to the Gods of Land and Grain and the Temple\r\nfor Rain are sacred places to the Chinese. To the latter the\r\nEmperor comes in solemn state in time of drought to pray for\r\nrain, or, if he cannot come, he sends the highest official of his\r\nrealm. It is in a spacious park and the buildings must have\r\nbeen stately and handsome before the Boxer outbreak. But\r\nwhen I saw them, they were sadly defaced. The stone balus-\r\ntrades and ornaments had been broken off, the walls had been\r\ninjured and one of the buildings was in ruins.\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, inevitable that much havoc should be\r\nwrought in the tumult of war. It was necessary that supplies\r\nfor half-naked and famished besieged thousands should be taken\r\nfrom deserted grain and clothing-shops. It was expedient that\r\ncertain public buildings should be destroyed by order of the\r\nallied generals as a warning for the future. But why were\r\nsoldiers and thieves allowed to steal the bric-a-brac and furniture\r\nand break the mirrors of the Emperor's personal apartments,\r\nwantonly to shatter beautiful columns, deface rare\r\nworks of art, punch holes in gilded statues, maliciously smash\r\nthe heads of thousands of exquisitely-carved figures and\r\nlions, and wreck venerable places associated with learning and\r\nart? The world is poorer for some of this havoc, and it will\r\nbe a generation before it can be remedied, if indeed, some of\r\nthe edifices are ever restored to their former beauty. Can we\r\nwonder that the Chinese continue to hate and fear the foreigner?\r\nThe New York Times declared that ``every outrage\r\nperpetrated on foreigners in China has been repaid tenfold by\r\nthe brutalities perpetrated by the allied armies. It is,'' added\r\nthe editor, ``simply monstrous that the armies of Christian\r\nnations, sent out to punish barbarism and protect the rights of\r\nforeigners in China, should themselves be guilty of barbarism.\r\nRevenge has been accompanied by mean and cruel and flagrant\r\nrobbery. The story is one to fill all rational minds with disgust\r\nand shame.''\r\n\r\nThe exasperation of the Chinese has not been diminished by\r\nthe virtual fortifications which the foreign Powers have erected\r\nin the imperial capital since the crushing of the Boxer uprising.\r\nMost of the Legations took advantage of the panic and confusion\r\nwhich followed the raising of the siege, to seize large\r\ntracts adjoining their former compounds. The native buildings\r\nupon them were demolished. Massive walls were erected and\r\ncannon mounted upon them. Over the water-gate in the city\r\nwall, through which the allied troops entered the city, the\r\nPowers have cut a new gateway which they hold and guard.\r\nIn addition, they have taken possession of all that part of the\r\ncity wall which commands Legation Street, made barricades\r\nand built a fort upon it opposite the German Legation. Foreign\r\nsoldiers patrol that wall night and day. On the other\r\nside of the Legations, a wide space has been cleared by destroying\r\nhundreds of Chinese dwellings and shops, and no buildings\r\nor trees or obstructions of any kind are allowed on that space,\r\nwhich can thus be swept by rifle and Gatling-gun fire in the\r\nevent of any future trouble. Within, ample stores of arms,\r\nammunition and food have been stored so that if another outbreak\r\nshould occur, the Legations cannot be besieged as they\r\nwere in the memorable summer of 1900.\r\n\r\nAll this, of course, is perfectly natural and perhaps necessary.\r\nThe Legations would be deemed lacking in ordinary\r\nprudence if they did not guard against the repetition of their\r\ngrievous experiences during the Boxer uprising. But looking\r\nat the matter from the view-point of the Chinese, can we marvel\r\nthat it is resented? Would not a European government be\r\nstung to the quick if other nations were to fortify themselves\r\nin that fashion at its capital? Would Americans endure it for\r\na day at Washington?\r\n\r\nAltogether, it must be admitted that the writer of ``Letters\r\nof a Chinese Official'' has all too much reason to arraign\r\nwestern civilization as sordid, arrogant and cruel and to assert\r\nthat Europeans and Americans, while pretending to follow the\r\nteachings of Christ, are really ignoring them. His words are\r\nbitter:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``Yes, it is we who do not accept it that practice the gospel of peace;\r\nit is you who accept it that trample it under foot. And irony of ironies!\r\n--it is the nations of Christendom who have come to us to teach us by\r\nsword and fire that Right in this world is powerless unless it be supported\r\nby Might. Oh, do not doubt that we shall learn the lesson! And woe\r\nto Europe when we have acquired it. You are arming a nation of four\r\nhundred millions, a nation which, until you came, had no better wish\r\nthan to live at peace with themselves and all the world. In the name of\r\nChrist you have sounded the call to arms! In the name of Confucius\r\nwe respond!''[95]\r\n\r\n\r\n[95] ``Letters of a Chinese Official,'' pp. 64, 65.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd he closes the book as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``Unless you of the West will come to realize the truth, unless you\r\nwill understand that the events which have shaken Europe are the\r\nNemesis of a long course of injustice and oppression; unless you will learn\r\nthat the profound opposition between your civilization and ours gives no\r\nmore ground why you should regard us as barbarians than we you, unless\r\nyou will treat us as a civilized power and respect our customs and our\r\nlaws; unless you will accord us the treatment you would accord to any\r\nEuropean nation and refrain from exacting conditions you would never\r\ndream of imposing on a Western power--unless you will do this, there is no\r\nhope of any peace between us. You have humiliated the proudest nation\r\nin the world; you have outraged the most upright and just; with what\r\nresults is now abundantly manifest.''\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether the author is really a Chinese official as he claims\r\nto be, or a European resident in China writing under a Chinese\r\npseudonym, there can be no doubt that he fairly represents the\r\nopinions of the old, conservative, ferociously irreconcilable\r\nmandarin class regarding the white man. Western nations, in\r\ntheir plans regarding the future of China, must take into\r\nconsideration the existence of that spirit and the acts which,\r\nwhile not creating it, have intensified and inflamed it till it has\r\ncome to be something to be reckoned with. Undoubtedly, one\r\nof the lessons that the Chinese have learned from defeat is\r\nbitterer hatred of the alien whose vandalisms and atrocities\r\nwere so shameful as to nullify, in part at least, the benefit that\r\nmight otherwise have resulted.\r\n\r\nI am glad to report that, with the single exception of the\r\nJapanese who were universally assigned the first place from the\r\nview-point of good behaviour, I heard fewer complaints regarding\r\nthe American troops than any other. One Colonel, indeed,\r\nlamented that his regiment ``was thoroughly demoralized,''\r\nand there were some instances of intemperance and lawlessness,\r\nin one case a Japanese patrol bringing in several American\r\nsoldiers who had been found at midnight in a Chinese house.\r\nBut as a whole, the conduct of the Americans was much better\r\nthan that of most of the Europeans. That the Chinese felt the\r\ndifference was apparent in the number of American flags that\r\nthey raised over their houses and shops. It was significant,\r\ntoo, that the districts of the city that were occupied by\r\nEuropean regiments were avoided, as far as possible, by the\r\nChinese, while the district controlled by the Americans was\r\nthronged.\r\n\r\nNor need any American be ashamed of the policy of his\r\nGovernment. It is true that the majority of the Americans\r\nin China believe that our national policy, prior to and\r\nduring the Boxer uprising, was weak and short-sighted. They\r\nspoke highly of Minister Conger and several of the American\r\nConsuls, particularly of Consul John Fowler, at Chefoo. But\r\nI was repeatedly told that our Government did not appear to\r\nrealize that there were any other American citizens or\r\nproperties in China than those in the Peking Legation; that it\r\ndid practically nothing to rescue its citizens in the prefecture of\r\nPaoting-fu and the province of Shan-si; that, while Americans\r\ncondemn the policy of the European Powers, they have been\r\nfor years sponging benefits secured by them for all foreigners;\r\nand that, if it had not been for their control of the situation,\r\nnot an American could have lived in China. The opinion was\r\nwell-nigh universal that the Washington Administration was\r\ntoo much influenced by the astute Chinese Minister, Wu Ting-\r\nfang, who was believed to be an adept in ``the ways that are\r\ndark and the tricks that are vain,'' and whose alleged success\r\nin ``hoodwinking the Government and people of the United\r\nStates'' provoked the average foreigner in the Far East to the\r\nuse of strong language.\r\n\r\nThough I confess that I am not able satisfactorily to explain\r\nthe course of our Government in some important particulars,\r\nit seems to me that these sweeping criticisms are too severe.\r\nDuring the dark days of the siege of Peking, I was brought\r\ninto frequent correspondence with President McKinley and\r\nSecretary of State Hay, and I vividly and gratefully remember\r\nthe sympathy and cooperation which they invariably\r\ngave. They were as anxious as any one, and tried to do their\r\nbest in circumstances new, strange and of extraordinary difficulty.\r\nAs for the Chinese Minister to the United States, of\r\ncourse he did what he could to ``save face'' for his country.\r\nThat was an essential part of his duty. But while we cannot\r\nalways agree with him, we should, as friends of China\r\nrecognize the fact that by his ability and tact, he largely\r\nincreased popular interest in and respect for the Chinese\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nTaking our Government's policy as a whole, I believe that it\r\nhas been more in accord with Christian principles than that of\r\nany other nation. If our Government has erred in trusting the\r\nChinese too much, that is ,at least better than erring by trusting\r\nthem too little. If it has failed to do for its own citizens\r\nall that it ought to have done, it has not wronged or humiliated\r\nthe Chinese Government. There is no blood of Chinese\r\nwomen and children on the hands of Americans in China. No\r\nrecord of outrage and iniquity blackens the page on which the\r\nAmerican part of the Boxer outbreak is written. If our nation\r\nhas been unjust to any, it has been to its own. Generations\r\nwill pass before the northern provinces will forget the bitterness\r\nof resentment which they now feel towards the European\r\nPowers. But already the Chinese are beginning to understand\r\nthat the American Government is a friend; that it does not\r\nseek their territory; that it will not be a party to extortion;\r\nthat it does not want to destroy China but to save her; that its\r\nobject is not to rule her, but to fit her to rule herself, and that it\r\ndesires only freedom for its citizens to trade and to communicate\r\nthose ideas of religion which we ourselves originally\r\nreceived from the East, which have brought to us inestimable\r\nblessings, and which will, in China as in America, result in the\r\nnoblest character for the individual and the most stable\r\ninstitutions for the state.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese keenly appreciate the fresh evidence of America's\r\nspirit of justice in connection with the payment of\r\nthe indemnity. When, before the payment of the first installment\r\nin 1902, the fall in the value of the silver tael led the\r\nEuropean Powers to insist that China should pay in gold,\r\nthereby virtually increasing the indemnity, it was the United\r\nStates again which did everything in its power to moderate the\r\ndemands of the European nations. If the legislative branch of\r\nthe American Government would only deal as justly with the\r\nChinese in the United States as the State Department deals\r\nwith the Chinese in China, the era of good feeling would be\r\ngreatly promoted.\r\n\r\nBut America is not prominent enough in China to make her\r\nexample a determinate factor in the attitude of the Empire\r\ntowards foreigners, nor are the people as a whole likely to\r\ndiscriminate in favour of a few Americans among the hosts of\r\naggressive, grasping, domineering Europeans.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the majority of the Chinese hear only what their\r\nscholars and officials tell them, and these worthies are careful\r\nto adjust the account to suit their own purposes, and to save\r\nthe national ``face.'' They blandly assure the credulous people\r\nthat the foreign armies did not follow the court because they\r\ndared not; that the alien troops left the capital because they\r\nwere driven out by Chinese patriots; and that the Boxers inflicted\r\ncrushing defeat upon their foes. During my visit in Tsing-\r\ntau, the Germans were digging sewers, broad and deep, with\r\nlaterals to every house and public building, and many of the\r\nChinese actually believed that these sewers were intended to\r\nbe underground passageways, down which the foreigners could\r\nflee to their boats when they were assailed by the redoubtable\r\nBoxers! The best-informed men I met in China, from Sir\r\nRobert Hart down, were fearful that the end was not near, and\r\nthat an official order might repeat the whole bloody history.\r\nAt a conference with forty representative missionaries of all\r\ndenominations in Shanghai, August, 1901, a very large majority\r\nagreed with the Rev. Dr. Parker, of the Southern Methodist\r\nChurch, in the statement: ``We are not out of the trouble\r\nyet; the reactonaries are in the minority, but they are in\r\npower. They have learned nothing and they will try again\r\nto drive us out unless the Powers unseat them and reinstate the\r\nEmperor and the Reform Party.''\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\nHOPEFUL SIGNS\r\n\r\nTHE future is not necessarily so doubtful as the facts\r\nand opinions cited in the preceding chapter might in\r\nthemselves seem to indicate. It is true that the daily\r\npress often contains accounts of tumults and revolutions in\r\nChina. But an Empire a third larger than all Europe, with\r\nan enormous population, a weak central Government, corrupt\r\nlocal officials, few railroads and frequent floods, famines and\r\nepidemics, is certain to have uprisings somewhere most of the\r\ntime. A European reading in the daily despatches from the\r\nUnited States of strikes, riots, martial law, the burning of\r\nnegroes, the mobbing of Chinese and the corruption of cities,\r\nmight with equal justice get the impression that our own\r\ncountry is in continual turmoil. The Imperial Government in\r\nChina pays little attention to what is going on in other parts\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n``Each province has its own army, navy, and system of taxation. . . .\r\nSo long as the provincial government sends its Peking supplies, administers\r\na reasonable sop to its clamorous provincial duns, quells incipient\r\ninsurrections, gives employment to its army of expectants, staves off\r\nforeign demands, avoids rows of all kinds, and, in a word, keeps up a\r\ndecent external surface of respectability, no questions are asked; all reports\r\nand promotions are passed; the Viceroy and his colleagues `enjoy\r\nhappiness,' and every one makes his `pile.' The Peking Government\r\nmakes no new laws, does nothing of any kind for any class of persons,\r\nleaves each province to its own devices, and, like the general staff of an\r\narmy organization, both absorbs successful men, and gives out needy or\r\nable men to go forth and do likewise.''[96]\r\n\r\n\r\n[96] E. H. Parker, ``China,'' pp. 167, 169.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances, the governors of provinces have considerable\r\nindependent power in internal affairs, and a rebellion\r\neven of formidable proportions is often ignored by the Imperial\r\nGovernment in Peking as a purely local matter to be dealt with\r\nby the provincial authorities, much as the United States Government\r\nleaves riots and mobs to the State officials.\r\n\r\nMoreover, to a greater extent than any other people, the\r\nChinese are led by their officials, and some of the highest\r\nofficials in Peking and the coast provinces have learned that\r\nmassacres of foreigners result in the coming of more foreigners,\r\nin the capture and destruction of cities, in humiliating terms\r\nof peace, in heavy indemnities, in large losses of territory and\r\nin the degradation and perhaps the execution of the magistrates\r\nwithin whose jurisdiction the troubles occur.\r\n\r\nThere are, moreover, unmistakable indications of a new\r\nmovement among the Chinese. One reason why they have\r\nbeen so ignorant of the rest of the world and even of distant\r\nparts of their own country was the lack of any facilities for\r\ntransmitting mail. The only way that the missionaries in the\r\ninterior could get their letters was by employing private messengers\r\nor availing themselves of a chance traveller. But now\r\na modern post-office system, superintended by Sir Robert Hart,\r\nalready includes 500 of the principal cities of the Empire and\r\nis being rapidly extended to others.\r\n\r\nTeu years ago, there were practically no newspapers in China\r\nexcept those published by foreigners in the ports, all of which\r\nwere in English save one which was in the German language.\r\nThe only periodicals in Chinese were a few issued by the\r\nmissionaries with, of course, a very limited circulation, chiefly\r\namong the Christians. There was no such thing as a Chinese\r\npress in the proper sense of the term. Now, besides a French,\r\na Russian and a second German paper, there are nearly a hundred\r\nChinese newspapers, many of them edited by the Chinese\r\nthemselves and others by Japanese, and all, aided by the railway,\r\nthe telegraph and the post-office, bringing new ideas to\r\nmultitudes. On the basis of a joint report to the Throne by\r\nViceroy Chang Chih-tung and Chang Pei-hsi, chancellor of the\r\nPeking University, an imperial decree has ordered the inauguration\r\nof a new system of education. The plan is to have a\r\nuniversity in the capital of each province, with auxiliary prefectural\r\nand district colleges and schools and the whole system\r\nto culminate in the Imperial University in Peking. In all these\r\ninstitutions western arts and sciences are to be taught side by\r\nside with the old Confucian classics. ``The Viceroys and\r\nGovernors of provinces are commanded to order their subordinates\r\nto hasten the establishment of these schools. Let this\r\ndecree be published through the Empire.''\r\n\r\nNor have the new imperial decrees stopped here. A few\r\ndecades ago, ambitious Chinese youths who sought an education\r\nabroad at their own expense were imprisoned on their return\r\nto their native land. One whom I met in Shantung gave\r\nme a vivid account of his arrest and incarceration in a filthy\r\ndungeon as if he had been a common criminal. But a recent\r\nedict of the Emperor directs the provincial Governors to select\r\nyoung men of ability and send them to Europe for special training\r\nwith a view to their occupying high posts on their return.\r\n\r\nOne of the most firmly rooted customs of old China was the\r\nexamination essay for literary degrees on some purely Chinese\r\nsubject relating to a remote past. But August 29, 1901, to the\r\namazement of the literati, an imperial edict abolished that\r\ntime-honoured custom and directed that in the future candidates\r\nfor degrees as well as for office should submit short essays\r\non such modern topics as Western science, governments, laws,\r\nand kindred subjects. The following extracts from the examination\r\nquestions for the Chu Jen (M. A.) degree in 1903\r\nwill indicate the extraordinary character of this change.\r\n\r\nHonen-- ``What improvements are to be derived from the\r\nstudy of foreign agriculture, commerce, and postal\r\nsystems?\r\n\r\nKwang-sg and An-huei--``What are the chief ideas underlying\r\nAustrian and German prosperity? How do foreigners\r\nregulate the press, post-office, commerce,\r\nrailways, banks, bank-notes, commercial schools,\r\ntaxation--and how do they get faithful men?\r\nWhere is the Caucasus and how does Russia rule\r\nit?\r\n\r\nKiang-si--``How many sciences theoretical and practical are\r\nthere? In what order should they be studied?\r\nExplain free trade and protection. What are the\r\nmilitary services of the world? What is the bearing\r\nof the Congress of Vienna, the Treaty of Berlin\r\nand the Monroe Doctrine on the Far East?\r\nWherein lies the naval supremacy of Great Britain?\r\nWhat is the bearing of the Siberian Railway and\r\nNicaragua Canal on China?\r\n\r\nShuntung--``What is Herbert Spencer's philosophy of sociology?\r\nDefine the relations of land, labour and capital.\r\nState how best to develop the resources of China\r\nby mines and railway?

Examinations cannot be passed\r\nwithout them. The mission presses, though run to their full\r\ncapacity, cannot keep up with the demand for their publications.\r\nDr. Timothy Richard of Shanghai reports that a quarter\r\nof a million dollars' worth of text-books were sold in that city\r\nin 1902, a single order received by the Presbyterian Press\r\ninvolving a bill of $328 for postage alone, as the buyer insisted\r\nthat the books should be sent by mail. Mission schools that\r\nteach the English language are thronged with students, many\r\nof them from the higher classes, and every foreigner who is\r\nwilling to teach Western learning finds his services eagerly\r\nsought.\r\n\r\nChina cannot be reformed by paper edicts even though they\r\nare written by an Emperor. Many reforms have been solemnly\r\nproclaimed in former years that accomplished little except to\r\n``save face'' for the Government. We need not therefore\r\nimagine that the millennium is to come in China this year.\r\nBut it is impossible to doubt that the reform decrees that have\r\nbeen issued since the Boxer uprising mean something more\r\nand are achieving something more than any other reform movements\r\nthat China ever saw before. Dr. Arthur H. Smith, who\r\nknows China and the Chinese as thoroughly as any other living\r\nman, writes:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``We behold the kernel of the reforms ordered by His Majesty, Kuang\r\nHsum in 1898, and which led to his dethronement and imprisonment,\r\nsubstantially adopted less than three years later by the Empress Dowager and\r\nher advisers. . . . The bare notation of the tenor of these far-reaching\r\nedicts gives to the Occidental reader but a vague notion of the tremendous\r\nintellectual revolution which they connote. Never before was\r\nthere such an order from any government involving the reconstruction of\r\nthe views of so many millions, by the study of the methods of government\r\nin other nations. . . . It is obvious to one who knows anything of the\r\nChinese educational system of the past millennium that the introduction\r\nof the new methods will involve its radical reconstruction from top to bottom.\r\nWestern geography, mathematics, science, history, and philosophy\r\nwill be everywhere studied. The result cannot fail to be an expansion of\r\nthe intellectual horizon of the Chinese race comparable to that which in\r\nEurope followed the Crusades. This will be a long process and a slow\r\none, but it is a certain one. . . . All signs indicate that China is open\r\nas never before.''\r\n\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the most powerful present factor in the policy\r\nof the Empire, and at the same time one of the best types of the\r\neducated Chinese, is Yuan Shih Kai, Viceroy of Chih-li and\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Chinese army. He is not a Manchu,\r\nlike many of the high officials of China, but a pure Chinese\r\nlike Li Hung Chang. Born in the Province of Honan,\r\nhe quickly developed unusual abilities. After a brilliant record\r\nfor a young man in his native land, he was sent to Korea as the\r\nrepresentative of the Emperor of China and for nine years he\r\nwas a conspicuous member of the diplomatic corps of the\r\nKorean capital. Returning to China in 1895, he was made\r\ncommander of a division of the ``New Imperial Army''--a\r\npost in which he manifested high military and administrative\r\nqualities. He organized and equipped his troops after the best\r\nforeign models and they speedily became so effective that, if\r\nthey had been more numerous and if he had been given a free\r\nhand in using them in Peking, the history of 1900 might have\r\nbeen different. I have had occasion elsewhere[98] to give some\r\naccount of the soldiers who escorted me through the interior.\r\nDecember, 1900, he was appointed Governor of the great province\r\nof Shantung. It was here that I met him, residing at Chinan-fu,\r\nthe capital of the province. As soon as possible after\r\nmy arrival, I sent my card and letters of introduction to the\r\nfamous Governor, and he promptly replied that he would receive\r\nme at one o'clock the following day. At the appointed\r\nhour, we called. With true courtesy, he met us at the entrance\r\nof the palace grounds and escorted us into his private room,\r\nwhich was neatly but very plainly furnished. He impressed\r\nme as a remarkable man. He was then forty-one years of age,\r\nof medium height, rather stout, with a strong face, a clear,\r\nfrank eye, and a most engaging manner. He would be considered\r\na man of striking appearance anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n[98] Chapter VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was very cordial, and we had a long and interesting conversation.\r\nHe surprised me by his familiarity with America,\r\nespecially as he spoke no English and had never been out of\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\nPartly at this interview and partly from other sources, I\r\nheard more of his plan to start a daily newspaper, a Military\r\nAcademy and a Literary College. His idea was to have in\r\neach institution two students from each of the 108 counties in\r\nthe province, and thus train a body of men who would be able\r\nto carry ``light and learning'' into their respective districts.\r\nHe appeared to feel that the only hope of averting such catastrophes\r\nas the Boxer uprising lay in enlightening the people.\r\nIn answer to a question as to the teaching of foreign languages,\r\nhe said that English, French and German would be taught, but\r\nthat German would probably be the most useful of the foreign\r\ntongues on account of the number of Germans in the eastern\r\npart of the province.\r\n\r\nThe Governor had shown the breadth of his intelligence, and\r\nat the same time his appreciation of the high character of Protestant\r\nmissionaries, by inviting one of them, the Rev. Dr. Watson\r\nM. Hayes, then President of the Presbyterian Mission College\r\nat Teng-chou, to become the President of the Literary\r\nCollege. I may anticipate so far as to state that Dr. Hayes\r\naccepted the invitation and began his work with every promise\r\nof large success. But unfortunately the rigid requirement of\r\nthe Government that each student should worship the tablet of\r\nConfucius at stated intervals and the refusal of Yuan Shih Kai's\r\nsuccessor to exempt Christian students made Dr. Hayes feel\r\nthat he had no alternative but to resign. Whether Yuan Shih\r\nKai, if he had remained in Shantung, would have been more\r\nlenient, it is, of course, impossible to say. I cherish the hope\r\nthat he would have been, for he is a large-minded man and he\r\ndiscerns the signs of the times more clearly than many of his\r\ncountrymen. But he is nevertheless a loyal disciple of Confucius\r\nand he might also have felt that questions of state policy\r\nwere involved. It is suggestive, however, that in the spring of\r\n1898 Yuan Shih Kai had selected a Protestant minister, the\r\nRev. Herbert E. House, D. D., (now of the Canton Christian\r\nCollege) as the tutor of his own son, Yuen Yen Tai. Dr.\r\nHouse says, by the way, that he found the youth ``wonderfully\r\npure in his thought, high in his ambition and intense in his\r\npassion for knowledge--the most patient and diligent student I\r\never knew.''\r\n\r\nBut to return to the interview with Yuan Shih Kai. The\r\nonly other Chinese present was Tang Hsiao-chuan, a man of\r\nabout thirty-five, who was in charge of the Provincial Foreign\r\nOffice with the rank of Tao-tai. He had spent two years at\r\nColumbia University in New York City, spoke English fluently\r\nand impressed me as a fine man. Like the Governor, his manners\r\nwere courtly and refined. He appeared to be a man of\r\nthe diplomatic type and worthy of the promotion that he will\r\ndoubtless receive.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning Captain Wang came on behalf of the\r\nGovernor to return our visit. He was the translator of the\r\nForeign Office and the tutor of one of the Governor's sons whom\r\nhe was teaching English grammar, arithmetic, geography and\r\nhistory. I was interested to find that he had spent eight years\r\nat Philips Academy, Massachusetts, and that he spoke English\r\nwith the grace of a cultured gentleman.\r\n\r\nThe policy of Yuan Shih Kai during the Boxer troubles indicated\r\nthe wisdom and the courage of the man. Disturbances\r\nhad already begun when he assumed office. It was not far\r\nsouthwest of Chinan-fu that Brooks, the devoted English missionary,\r\nwas murdered by the Boxers. Yu Hsien was then\r\nGovernor of Shantung but about that time was transferred to\r\nShan-si, Yuan Shih Kai taking his place. If the notorious\r\nforeign-hating Yu Hsien had remained in Shantung, probably he\r\nwould have massacred the Shantung missionaries as he did\r\nthose of Shan-si, where he invited them all to his yamen, and\r\nthen began the butchery by killing three missionaries with his\r\nown hand. But Yuan Shih Kai foresaw the inevitable result\r\nof such barbarity and determined to restrain the Boxers and\r\nprotect foreigners. He succeeded with the foreigners, not one\r\nbeing killed after he took control, and all being helped as far\r\nas possible to escape. As soon as the storm had passed, he\r\nofficially wrote to the missionaries who had taken refuge at the\r\nports:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``Everything is now quiet. If you, reverend sirs, wish to return to the\r\ninterior, I would beg you first give me word that I may most certainly\r\norder the military everywhere most carefully to protect and escort.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThis apparently pro-foreign policy brought upon the Governor,\r\nfor a time, no small obloquy from the fiercely-fanatical\r\nconservatives who wanted to murder every foreigner within\r\nreach. Indeed the fury of the populace was so great that he\r\nwas bitterly reviled as ``a secondary devil,'' and his life was\r\nrepeatedly threatened. But despite the clamour of the mob\r\nand the opposition of his associates in the government of the\r\nprovince, he maintained his position with iron inflexibility.\r\nAfterwards, however, the people as well as his official subordinates\r\nrealized that he had saved them from the awful punishment\r\nthat was inflicted upon the neighbouring province of\r\nChih-li, and his power and prestige became greater than ever.\r\n\r\nDuring my visit in Chining-chou, in the remote southwestern\r\npart of the province, an incident occurred which illustrated at\r\nonce the power of Yuan Shih Kai's name and the heroic devotion\r\nof the missionaries. The day after our arrival, a friendly\r\nChinese official brought word that Governor Yuan Shih Kai's\r\nmother had died the day before. Chinese custom in such circumstances\r\nrequired him to resign his office and go into retirement\r\nfor three years. Now Consul Fowler and all the foreigners\r\nwhom I had met in the ports had declared that the safety\r\nof foreigners in Shantung depended on the Governor, that as\r\nlong as he was in power white men were safe, but that his death\r\nor removal might bring another tumult of anti-foreign fury.\r\nOn the strength of his known friendship, mission work was\r\nbeing resumed and the missionaries were returning to the interior.\r\n\r\nNow this man, on whose continuance in office so much depended,\r\nwas apparently to retire and the future made all uncertain\r\nagain. The Empress Dowager might give the post to a\r\nforeign-hater. An indifferent or even a weak pro-foreign Governor\r\nwould be little better, for a strong man was needed to\r\nhold the population of Shantung in hand. The Chinese quickly\r\ntake their cue from a high official and even a suspicion that he\r\nwould not interfere might again loose the dogs of war. True,\r\nwe had seen no signs of enmity, but appearances are deceptive\r\nin Asia. The smile of the mighty Governor meant a smile\r\nfrom every one. But what fires were smouldering beneath no\r\none could know. Even in America, there are lawless men who\r\nwould mob Chinese in a minute if they knew that the police\r\nwere weak or indifferent.\r\n\r\nI did not fear for myself, for my plans compelled me to\r\njourney on to Ichou-fu anyway. But I did not like to leave\r\nMr. Laughlin and Dr. Lyon, who had come with the intention\r\nof remaining to reopen the mission work at Chining-chou.\r\nBut with the true missionary spirit, they bravely decided to\r\nstay. A week later, they learned that in view of the importance\r\nof the province and his confidence in the great Governor, the\r\nEmperor had by a special dispensation shortened the period of\r\nofficial mourning from three years to one hundred days. During\r\nthat time, the Fan-tai (treasurer) would be the nominal head\r\nof the province, though it was quietly understood that even\r\nthen the Governor would be the ``power behind the throne.''\r\nBut as this was not known when the decision to remain was\r\nmade, the heroism of the missionaries was none the less\r\nstriking.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of Yuan Shih Kai is fairly indicated in the regulations\r\nwhich he caused to be widely published after the Boxer\r\noutbreak. Some of these were as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``In order to protect foreigners from violence and all mission property\r\nfrom burning and other destruction, all civil and military officials with all\r\ntheir subordinates (including literati, constables, village elders, et al.),\r\nmust use their utmost endeavours to insure their protection. Persons refusing\r\nto submit to officials in these matters may be instantly executed\r\nwithout further reference to the Governor, and any one who rescues foreigners\r\nfrom violence will be amply rewarded.\r\n\r\n``Any persons having been found guilty of destroying mission property\r\nor using violence to foreigners shall be severely dealt with according to\r\nthe laws which refer to highway robbers, and in addition to this their\r\ngoods and property shall be confiscated for the public use.\r\n\r\n``If injury to missionaries or destruction of property occurs in any district\r\nwhatever, both civil and military officials of said district shall be degraded\r\nand reported to the Throne.\r\n\r\n``The elders, constables, et al., of every village shall do their utmost to\r\nprotect missionaries and their property. If in the future there occurs in\r\nany village destruction of property or violence to a missionary, the headmen\r\nof such village shall be dealt with according to the edict issued\r\nduring the twenty-second year of the present Emperor. And, in addition\r\nto this they shall be required to present themselves to the yamen and\r\nmake good all losses. The constables of such villages shall be severely\r\ndealt with and expelled from office forever.\r\n\r\n``All civil and military officials in whose districts none of these offenses\r\nnamed above occur in one year shall be rewarded with the third degree\r\nof merit, and three years of such freedom shall entitle the same officials to\r\npromotion.\r\n\r\n``Rewards will also be given to village elders and constables in whose\r\ndistrict no disturbance occurs.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are rather remarkable words from a high Chinese\r\nofficial. Now their author occupies a position of even greater\r\nauthority, for after the death of Li Hung Chang, he was appointed\r\nto succeed him as Viceroy of Chih-li in November,\r\n1901. Chih-li is not only one of the greatest provinces of the\r\nEmpire with a population of 20,937,000, but it includes the\r\nimperial city of Peking and the ports of Tong-ku and Tien-\r\ntsin, the gateways to the capital. The Viceroy thus controls\r\nall avenues of approach to the Throne and is, in a sense,\r\ncharged with the protection of the royal family. He has free\r\naccess at all times to the Emperor and the Empress Dowager\r\nwith whom he is a prime favourite. It was this position of high\r\nvantage which enabled Li Hung Chang to become well-nigh\r\nomnipotent in China. Yuan Shih Kai is not such a wily\r\nschemer as his distinguished predecessor and he is not likely to\r\nuse his position for self-aggrandizement to the extent that Li\r\nHung Chang did. But he is quite as able a man and more\r\nfrank and reliable. He has enemies, as every public man has,\r\nespecially in Asia. Some can never forgive him for his supposed\r\npart in the virtual dethronement of the Emperor several years\r\nago. It is alleged that the Emperor counted on the army of\r\nYuan Shih Kai to support him in his reform policy, but that\r\nYuan consulted with Jung Lu, who was then the Viceroy of\r\nChih-li, and that that worthy promptly laid the whole matter\r\nbefore the Empress Dowager; the result being that the young\r\nEmperor awoke one morning to find himself practically stripped\r\nof his imperial power.[99] Yuan has been freely charged with\r\ntreachery in this coup d'etat. Others hold that he did not intend\r\ntreachery but only consultation with his superior officer\r\nas to what ought to be done in a grave crisis which was in\r\nitself revolutionary in character. Yuan was far from being a\r\nreactionary, but he was wise enough to see that China could\r\nnot be suddenly transformed, and he naturally hesitated to lend\r\nhimself to an enterprise which he believed to be premature and\r\nto be destined to result in certain failure. The soundness of\r\nhis judgment is now generally recognized, and the Emperor himself\r\nis said to be almost as friendly towards him as the Empress\r\nDowager, who counts him one of her ablest supporters.\r\n\r\n\r\n[99] Cf. Imperial Decree of Sept. 22, 1898, quoted in Pott, ``The Outbreak\r\nin China,'' pp. 55sq,\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the present critical condition of far eastern politics, much\r\ndepends upon the policy of Yuan Shih Kai. With exalted\r\nrank, the ear of the Empress Dowager and the command of the\r\nonly real soldiers that China possesses, he can do more than\r\nany other man to influence the course of the Empire. Of\r\ncourse, one official, however powerful, cannot absolutely control\r\nnational conditions. The forces at work both within and without\r\nthe Empire are too vast and too complicated. Nevertheless,\r\nthe fact that such an able and far-seeing man as Yuan\r\nShih Kai is now the most influential Viceroy in China, the\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Army, and the trusted adviser of the\r\nEmpress Dowager may be fairly included among the hopeful\r\nsigns for the future.\r\n\r\nMost significant of all is the development of missionary work\r\nsince the Boxer outbreak. Not only have all the destroyed\r\nchurches and chapels been rebuilt, but they are, as a rule,\r\ncrowded with worshippers. In the Wei-hsien station field in\r\nShantung, where every missionary was driven out and all the\r\nmission property destroyed, 569 Chinese were baptized last\r\nyear. In Peking, the large new Presbyterian church, though\r\nerected near that great cistern in which nearly 100 bodies were\r\nfound after the siege, is filled at almost every service and the\r\nchurches of other denominations are also largely attended. At\r\na single service, Dr. Pentecost preached to 800 attentive Chinese\r\nyoung men. Even in Paoting-fu, where every remaining\r\nmissionary and scores of Chinese Christians were killed, and\r\nwhere one might suppose that no Chinese would ever dare to\r\nconfess Christ, even in bloodstained Paoting-fu, the missionaries\r\nare preaching daily to throngs of attentive Chinese in the city,\r\nwhile at the spacious new compounds outside the walls the\r\nschools and hospitals and churches are taxed to care for the\r\nhundreds who go to them. In the Canton field, long known\r\nfor its anti-foreign feeling, 1,564 Chinese were baptized last\r\nyear by the Presbyterians alone and the missionaries are importunately\r\ncalling for reinforcements to enable them to meet\r\nthe multiplied demands upon them. Even the province of\r\nHunan, which a decade ago was almost as inhospitable to foreigners\r\nas Thibet, now has half a hundred Protestant and Catholic\r\nmissionaries developing a prosperous work. Bishop Graves,\r\nof the Protestant Episcopal Church, returned recently from an\r\nepiscopal visitation with this inspiring message:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``The condition and outlook of the Church's work in the province of\r\nKiang-su are more encouraging than ever before. Hitherto we have had\r\nto persuade people to be taught. Now they come to us themselves, not\r\none by one, but in numbers. . . . That there is a strong movement\r\ntowards Christianity setting in is evident.''[100]\r\n\r\n\r\n[100] ``The Spirit of Missions,'' July, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only has the old work been resumed with vigour but much\r\nnew work has been opened. Within a year and a quarter after\r\nthe relief of the Legations by the Allies, twenty-five new mission\r\nstations had been opened and 373 new missionaries had\r\nentered China, and each succeeding year has seen considerable\r\nadditions to the number. The Rev. Dr. George F. Pentecost,\r\nwho visited China in 1903, writes--\r\n\r\n\r\n``The outlook seems to me most encouraging. I find the more thoughtful\r\nmissionaries enthusiastic in their forecast for the future. My own\r\njudgment is that the cause of missions, so far as foundation work and increased\r\npower for work, has been advanced at least twenty-five years by\r\nthe massacres of 1900. I think the common people are thoroughly convinced\r\nthat missions cannot be destroyed, and I am equally convinced\r\nthat the authorities are also convinced that it is vain for them to rage and\r\nset themselves against Christianity. The one thing which an Asiatic\r\nrecognizes is power and facts accomplished, and in the rebuilding of our\r\nmissions and the awakening already begun and the reinforcement of the\r\nmissions in men and material means they see and recognize power. Their\r\nown temples are falling into decay and ruin and our new buildings are\r\nrising in prominence and beauty. Their ignorant priesthood is sinking\r\ndeeper and deeper into degradation, while our missionaries are every\r\nwhere known and recognized as men of `light and learning.' . . .\r\nIt seems to me from all I can learn that there is no fear of another anti-\r\nforeign outbreak.''\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd these are but a few of the many illustrations that could\r\nbe given. Everywhere, the doors are open and Chinese are\r\nnow being baptized by Protestant missionaries at the rate of\r\nabout 15,000 a year, while a far larger number are enrolled as\r\ninquirers or catechumens. The interdenominational conference\r\nof missionaries at Kuling, August 7, 1903, declared:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``It is now a fact that there is not one of the more than nineteen\r\nhundred counties of China and Manchuria from which we are shut out, and\r\nbefore the hundredth year of our work begins, we can say that if the gospel\r\nis not preached to every creature in China, the reason must be sought outside\r\nChina. The opportunities of work are varied in their kind, vast in\r\ntheir extent. Never before have men crowded to hear the gospel as they\r\nare crowding now in the open air and indoors; in our chapels and in our\r\nguest-rooms we have opportunities to preach Christ such as can scarcely\r\nbe found outside China. Never before has there been such an eager desire\r\nfor education as there is now; our schools, both of elementary and of\r\nhigher grades, are full, and everywhere applicants have to be refused.\r\nNever before has there been such a demand for Christian literature as\r\nthere is now; our tract societies and all engaged in supplying converts\r\nand inquirers with reading material are doing their utmost, but are not\r\nable to overtake the demand; and the demand is certain to increase, for\r\nit comes from the largest number of people in the world reading one language.\r\nThe medical work has from the first found an entrance into hearts\r\nthat were closed against other forms of work. Its sphere of influence\r\ngrows ever wider and is practically unlimited. Unique opportunities of\r\nservice are afforded us by the large number of blind people, by lepers,\r\nand those suffering from incurable diseases; by the deaf and dumb, the\r\ninsane and other afflicted people. In China the poor are always with us,\r\nand whensoever we will we may do them good.''\r\n\r\n\r\nNot least among the hopeful signs for the future is the new\r\ntreaty between the United States and China which was signed\r\nat Shanghai, October 8, 1903, and unanimously ratified by the\r\nUnited States Senate December 18, 1903. It not only secured\r\nan ``open door'' in China for Americans, but, if the veteran\r\n``most favoured nation'' clause is again pressed into service, a\r\npriceless benefit to the whole civilized world as well as to\r\nChina herself. For this treaty abolished the exasperating\r\n``likin'' (the inland tax heretofore exacted by local officials on\r\ngoods in transit through their territories); confirmed the right\r\nof American citizens to trade, reside, travel, and own property\r\nin China; extended to China the United States' copyright\r\nlaws; gained a promise from the Chinese Government to establish\r\na patent office in which the inventions of United States'\r\ncitizens may be protected; and made valuable regulations regarding\r\ntrade-marks, mining concessions, judicial tribunals for\r\nthe hearing of complaints, diplomatic intercourse, and several\r\nother matters which, though sanctioned by custom, were often\r\nabridged or violated.\r\n\r\nThe treaty, moreover, called for the opening of two additional\r\ntreaty ports, one of which is at Feng-tien-fu, more generally\r\nknown as Mukden, important not only as a city of 200,000 inhabitants\r\nbut as the capital of Manchuria and with both rail\r\nand river connection with the Gulf of Pe-chi-li and the imperial\r\nprovince of Chih-li. The other is at An-tung, which is important\r\nbecause of its situation on the Yalu River opposite the\r\nKorean frontier. Of course, the Russia-Japan War has post-\r\nponed the opening of these ports, but the recognition of China's\r\nright to open them by treaty with the United States is none the\r\nless significant.\r\n\r\nMost important of all, the treaty removes, so far as any such\r\nenactment can remove, the last barrier to the extension of Christianity\r\nthroughout China. In Article XIII of the English treaty\r\nwith China, September 5, 1902, Great Britain agreed to join\r\nin a commission to secure peaceable relationships between converts\r\nand non-converts in China. But the American treaty\r\ngoes much farther, as the following extract (Article XIV) will\r\nshow:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``The principles of the Christian religion, as professed by the Protestant\r\nand Roman Catholic Churches, are recognized as teaching men to do good\r\nand to do to others as they would have others do to them. Those who\r\nquietly profess and teach these doctrines shall not be harassed or persecuted\r\non account of their faith. Any person, whether citizen of the\r\nUnited States or Chinese convert, who, according to these tenets, peaceably\r\nteaches and practices the principles of Christianity shall in no case\r\nbe interfered with or molested therefor. No restrictions shall be placed\r\non Chinese joining Christian churches. Converts and non-converts, being\r\nChinese subjects, shall alike conform to the laws of China, and shall\r\npay due respect to those in authority, living together in peace and amity;\r\nand the fact of being converts shall not protect them from the consequences\r\nof any offense they may have committed before or may commit after their\r\nadmission into the church, or exempt them from paying legal taxes levied\r\non Chinese subjects generally, except taxes levied and contributions for\r\nthe support of religious customs and practices contrary to their religion.\r\nMissionaries shall not interfere with the exercise by the native authorities\r\nof their jurisdiction over Chinese subjects; nor shall the native authorities\r\nmake any distinction between converts and non-converts, but shall administer\r\nthe laws without partiality, so that both classes can live together in\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n``Missionary societies of the United States shall be permitted to rent\r\nand to lease in perpetuity as the property of such societies, buildings or\r\nlands in all parts of the Empire for missionary purposes and, after the\r\ntitle-deeds have been found in order and duly stamped by the local authorities,\r\nto erect such suitable buildings as may be required for carrying on\r\ntheir good work.''\r\n\r\nThis gives new prestige to American missionary effort and\r\nlegally confirms the opening of the Empire from end to end to\r\nmissionary residence, activity and toleration. All that France\r\nharshly obtained for Roman Catholic missions by the Berthemy\r\nconvention of 1865 and by the haughty ultimatum of M.\r\nGerard at the close of the war with Japan, the United States\r\nhas now peacefully secured with the apparent good-will of the\r\nChinese Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE PARAMOUNT DUTY OF CHRISTENDOM\r\n\r\nIT would be unwise to underestimate the gravity of the\r\nsituation, or to assume that the most numerous and conservative\r\nnation on the globe has been suddenly transformed\r\nfrom foreign haters to foreign lovers. The world may\r\nagain have occasion to realize that the momentum of countless\r\nmyriads is an awful force even against the resources of a\r\nhigher civilization, as the Romans found to their consternation\r\nwhen the barbarian hordes overran the Empire. We do not\r\nknow what disturbances may yet occur or what proportions\r\nthey may assume. It may be that much blood will yet be\r\nshed. Inflamed passions will certainly be slow in subsiding.\r\nMen who are identified with the old era will not give up without\r\na struggle. It took 300 years to bring England from pagan\r\nbarbarism to Christian civilization, and China is vaster far\r\nand more conservative than England. The world moves faster\r\nnow, and the change-producing forces of the present exceed\r\nthose of former centuries as a modern steam hammer exceeds a\r\nwooden sledge. But China is ponderous, and a few decades\r\nare short for so gigantic a transformation.\r\n\r\nMeantime, much depends on the future conduct of foreigners.\r\nIt is hard enough for the proud-spirited Chinese to see the\r\naliens coming in greater numbers than ever and entrenching\r\nthemselves more and more impregnably, and a continuance of\r\nthe policy of greed and injustice will deepen an already deep\r\nresentment. The almost invincible prejudice against the foreigner\r\nis a serious hindrance to the regeneration of China.\r\n``This fact emphasizes the need for using every means possible\r\nfor the breaking down of such a prejudice. Every careless or\r\nwillful wound to Chinese susceptibilities, or unnecessary crossing\r\nof Chinese superstitions, retards our own work and increases\r\nthe dead wall of opposition on the part of this people.''[101]\r\n\r\n\r\n[101] The Rev. Dr. J. C. Garritt, Hang chou.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proper way to deal with the Chinese was illustrated by\r\nthe Rev. J. Walter Lowrie of the Presbyterian Mission at\r\nPaoting-fu when, as a token of appreciation for his services to\r\nthe city in connection with the retaliatory measures of the\r\nforeign troops shortly after the Boxer outbreak, the magistrate\r\nraised a special fund among wealthy Chinese, bought a fine\r\ntract of sixteen acres and presented it to the mission as a gift.\r\nThe tract had been occupied for many years by several\r\nfamilies of tenants who had built their own houses, but who\r\nwere now to be evicted. Of course, Mr. Lowrie was not\r\nresponsible for them. But he insisted that they should be\r\ndealt with fairly, and be paid a reasonable price for their homes\r\nand the improvements that they had made so that they could\r\nrent land and establish themselves elsewhere. In addition, he\r\nwas at pains to find work for them until their new crops became\r\navailable. Their affectionate greeting of Mr. Lowrie as\r\nwe walked about the place clearly showed their gratification.\r\nThere is not the slightest trouble with the Chinese when they\r\nare treated with ordinary decency as brother men.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, in the name of that civilization and Christianity\r\nwhich we profess, as well of common humanity, let foreign\r\nnations abandon the methods of brutality and rapine. If we\r\nexpect to convert the Chinese, we must exemplify the principles\r\nwe teach. It is not true that the Chinese cannot understand\r\njustice and magnanimity. Even if it were true, it does not\r\nfollow that we should be unjust and pitiless. Let us instruct\r\nthem in the higher things. How are they ever to learn, if we\r\ndo not teach them? But as a matter of fact, the Chinese are\r\nas amenable to reason as any people in the world. Their\r\ntemperament and inertia and long isolation from the remainder\r\nof mankind have made them slow to grasp a new idea. But\r\nthey will get it if they are given reasonable time, and when\r\nthey do once get it, they will hold it. Whether, therefore,\r\nfurther trouble occurs, depends in part upon the conduct of\r\nforeign nations. Justice and humanity in all dealings with the\r\nChinese, while not perhaps wholly preventing outbreaks of\r\nhostility, will at least give less occasion for them.\r\n\r\nBut however trying the period of transition may be, the issue is\r\nnot for a moment doubtful. Progress invariably wins the victory\r\nover blind conservatism. The higher idea is sure to conquer\r\nthe lower. With all their admixture of selfishness and\r\nviolence, the fact remains that the forces operating on China\r\nto-day include the vital regenerative element for human\r\nsociety. It is futile to expect that China could ever regenerate\r\nherself without outside aid. Spontaneous regeneration is\r\nan exploded theory in society as well as in biology. Life always\r\ncomes from without.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of China's new system of education shows that\r\nthere is imminent danger of the misuse of modern methods,\r\neven when they have been adopted. All her institutions are\r\nconducted on principles which virtually debar Christians\r\neither as students or professors. Infidelity, however, has free\r\nentrance as long as it conforms to the external forms imposed\r\nby the State. ``Anti-conservative but anti-Christian,'' the\r\neducational movement has been characterized by Dr. W. M.\r\nHayes of Teng-chou. Dr. W. A. P. Martin, so long President\r\nof the Imperial Chinese University, declares that ``if\r\nChristians at home only knew what a determined effort is being\r\nmade to exclude Christian teachers and Christian text-books\r\nfrom Chinese Government schools, from the Imperial University\r\ndown, they would exert themselves to give a Christian\r\neducation to the youth of China.'' A single mission institution,\r\nlike the Shantung Protestant University, with its\r\nunion of the best educational methods and the highest ideals\r\nof Christian character, will do more for the real enlightenment\r\nof China than a dozen provincial colleges where gambling,\r\nirreligion and opium smoking are freely tolerated and a failure\r\nto worship the tablet of Confucius is deemed the only\r\ncardinal sin.\r\n\r\nIn view of all these things, the regeneration of China becomes\r\na question of transcendent importance, a question demanding\r\nthe broadest statesmanship and the supremest effort; a question\r\ninvolving the future destinies of the race. ``On account of its\r\nmass, its homogeneity, its high intellectual and moral qualities,\r\nits past history, its present and prospective relations to the\r\nwhole world, the conversion of the Chinese people to Christianity\r\nis the most important aggressive enterprise now laid upon\r\nthe Church of Christ.''[102] It would be a calamity to the whole\r\nworld if the dominant powers of Asia should continue to be\r\nheathen. But if they are not to be, immediate and herculean\r\nefforts must be made to regenerate them. Sir Robert Hart\r\ndeclares that the only hope of averting ``the yellow peril'' lies\r\neither in partition among the great Powers, which he regards as\r\nso difficult as to be impracticable, or in a miraculous spread of\r\nChristianity which will transform the Empire. Beyond\r\nquestion, Sir Robert Hart is right. It is too late now to avoid\r\nthe issue. The impact of new forces is rousing this gigantic\r\nnation, and Western nations must either conquer or convert.\r\nConquering is out of the question for reasons already given.[103]\r\nThe only alternative is conversion. In these circumstances\r\n``the yellow peril becomes the golden opportunity of Christendom.''[104]\r\n\r\n\r\n[102] Smith, ``Rex Christus,'' p. 237\r\n\r\n[103] Chapter XXV.\r\n\r\n[104] The Rev. Dr. Maltbie D. Babcock.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd by conversion is not meant ``civilization.'' Here is\r\nthe fundamental error of the pseudonymous writer of ``Letters\r\nFrom a Chinese Official.'' He evidently knows little or nothing\r\nof the missionary force or of the motives which control it. He\r\nwrites as a man who has lived in a commercial and political atmosphere,\r\nand who feels outraged, and with some justice, by the\r\npolicy which European nations have adopted towards\r\nChina. From this view-point, it was easy for the quick-\r\nwitted author to satirize our defects and to laud the virtues,\r\nsome of them unquestionably real, of his native land. But it\r\ndoes not follow that his indictment holds against the Christian\r\npeople of the West, who reprobate as strongly as the author\r\nthe duplicity and brutality of foreign nations in their dealings\r\nwith China. The West has something more to offer China\r\nthan a civilization. As a matter of fact, the best people of the\r\nWest are not trying to give China a civilization at all, but a\r\ngospel. With whatever is good in Chinese civilization, they\r\nhave no wish to interfere. It is true that some changes in\r\nsociety invariably follow the acceptance of Christianity, but\r\nthese changes relate only to those things that are always and\r\neverywhere inherently wrong, irrespective of the civilization to\r\nwhich they appear to belong. The gospel transformed ``the\r\nFive Points'' in New York not because they were uncivilized\r\nbut because they were evil. It will do in China only what it\r\ndoes in America--fight vice, cleanse foulness, dispel superstition.\r\nChristianity is the only power which does this. It has\r\ntransformed every people among whom it has had free course.\r\nIt has purified society. It has promoted intelligence. It has\r\nelevated woman. It has fitted for wise and beneficent use of\r\npower. Of those who deny this, Lowell says:\r\n\r\n\r\n``So long as these very men are dependent for every privilege they enjoy\r\nupon that religion which they discard, they may well hesitate a little\r\nbefore seeking to rob the Christian of his faith and humanity of its hope in\r\nthat Saviour who alone has given to man that hope of eternal life which\r\nmakes life tolerable and society possible, and robs death of its terrors and\r\nthe grave of its gloom.''\r\n\r\n\r\nNo degradation is beyond the reach of its regenerating power.\r\nWitness the New Hebrides, Metlakatla, the Fiji, Georgia and\r\nFriendly Islands. Even England, Germany and America\r\nthemselves are in evidence. Christianity lifted them out of a\r\nbarbarism and superstition as dense as any prevailing among\r\nthe heathen nations of this age. It can effect like changes in\r\nChina if it is given the opportunity.\r\n\r\nBut it is said that the Chinese do not want to be converted.\r\nA distinguished General of the United States army declared,\r\nafter his return from Peking in 1900:--``I must say that I did\r\nnot meet a single intelligent Chinaman who expressed a desire\r\nto embrace the Christian religion. The masses are against\r\nChristianity.''[105] It is pleasant to know that it is so common\r\nfor unconverted Americans to go to that army officer for\r\nspiritual guidance that the failure of the Chinese to do so\r\ndisappointed him. Most men would hardly have expected a\r\npeople who were smarting under defeat to open their hearts to\r\na commander of the conquering army. But hundreds of other\r\nforeigners in China, myself included, can testify that they have\r\nheard intelligent Chinese express a desire to embrace the Christian\r\nreligion, and the fact that there are in China to-day over a\r\nhundred thousand Chinese, to say nothing of myriads of enrolled\r\ncatechumens, who have publicly confessed their faith in\r\nChrist and who have tenaciously adhered to it under sore persecution\r\nis tangible evidence that some Chinese at least are disposed\r\nto accept Christianity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[105] The Christian Advocate, New York, June 11, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo they want Him? ``It would please you,'' a missionary\r\nwrites, ``to see these poor people feeling after God, and their\r\neagerness to learn more and more.'' It is not uncommon for\r\nconverts to travel ten, fifteen and even twenty miles to attend\r\nservice. The Sunday I was in Ichou-fu, I met a fine-looking\r\nyoung man, named Yao Chao Feng, who had walked sixteen\r\nmiles to receive Christian baptism, and several other Chinese\r\nwere present who had journeyed on foot from seventeen to\r\nthirty-three miles. In Paoting-fu, I heard of a mother and\r\ndaughter who had painfully hobbled on bound feet thirteen\r\nmiles that they might learn more about the new faith. In\r\nanother city, 800 opium-smokers kneeled in a church and\r\nasked God to help them break the chains of that frightful\r\nhabit. Surely He who puts His fatherly arms around the\r\nprodigal and kissed him was in that humble church and answered\r\nthe prayer of those poor, sin-cursed men. It would\r\nbe easy to fill a book with such instances.\r\n\r\nBut suppose the Chinese do not want Christ. What of it?\r\nDid they want the distinguished General? On the contrary, he\r\nhad to fight his way into Peking at the mouth of the cannon\r\nand the point of the bayonet, over the dead bodies of Chinese\r\nand through the ruins of Chinese towns. Do ``the masses''\r\ndesire Christ anywhere? Mr. Moody used to say that the\r\npeople of the United States did not want Christ and would\r\nprobably reject Him if He came to them as He came to the\r\nJews of old.\r\n\r\nThe question is not at all whether the Chinese or anybody\r\nelse desire Christ, but whether they need Him, and a man's\r\nanswer to that question largely depends upon his own relations\r\nto Christ. If we need Him, the Chinese do. If He has done\r\nanything for us, if He has brought any dignity and power and\r\npeace into our lives, the probabilities are that He can do as\r\nmuch for the Chinese.\r\n\r\n\r\n``Be assured that the Christ who cannot save a Chinaman in longitude\r\n117'0 East is a Christ who cannot save you in longitude 3'0 west. The\r\nquestion about missions would not be so lightly put, nor the answer so\r\nlightly listened to, if men realized that what is at stake is not a mere\r\nscheme of us missionaries, but the validity of their own hope of eternal\r\nlife. Yet I am bound to say that the questions put to me, on returning\r\nfrom the mission field, by professedly Christian people often shake my\r\nfaith, not in missions, but in their Christian profession. What kind of\r\ngrasp of the gospel have men got, who doubt whether it is to-day, under\r\nany skies, the power of God unto salvation?''[106]\r\n\r\n\r\n[106] Gibson, pp. 11, 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt passes comprehension that any one who has even a superficial\r\nknowledge of the real China can doubt for a moment its\r\nvital need of the gospel. The wretchedness of its life appalls an\r\nAmerican who goes back into the unmodified conditions of the\r\ninterior or even into the old Chinese city of proud Shanghai.\r\nAs I journeyed through those vast throngs, climbed many hilltops\r\nand looked out upon the innumerable villages, which\r\nthickly dotted the plain as far as the eye could reach, as I saw\r\nthe unrelieved pain and the crushing poverty and the abject\r\nfear of evil spirits, I felt that in China is seen in literal truth\r\n``The Man with the Hoe.''\r\n\r\n ``Bowed by the weight of centuries, he leans\r\n Upon his hoe and gazes on the ground,\r\n The emptiness of ages in his face,\r\n And on his back the burden of the world.\r\n\r\n ``What gulfs between him and the seraphim,\r\n Slave of the wheel of labour, what to him\r\n Are Plato and the swing of Pleiades?\r\n What the long reaches of the peaks of song,\r\n The rift of dawn, the reddening of the rose?\r\n Through this dread shape the suffering ages look;\r\n Time's tragedy is in that aching stoop.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the need to which the churches of Europe and\r\nAmerica are addressing themselves through the boards and\r\nsocieties of foreign missions. These boards are the channels\r\nthrough which the highest type of Christian civilization is\r\ncommunicated to pagan peoples, the agencies which gather up all\r\nthat is best and truest in our modern life and concentrate it\r\nupon the conditions of China. From this view-point, foreign\r\nmissions is not only a question of religion, but a problem of\r\nstatesmanship, and one of overshadowing magnitude. As\r\nsuch, it merits the sympathy and cooperation of every intelligent\r\nand broad-minded man, irrespective of his religious affiliations.\r\nIts spiritual aims are supreme and sufficient for every\r\ntrue disciple of Christ, but apart from them its social and educational\r\nvalue and its relation to the welfare of the race justly\r\nclaim the interest and support of all. In this work the Church\r\nis saving both individuals and nations, and for time as well as\r\nfor eternity. It holds no pessimistic views of the future. It\r\ndenies that the development of the race has ended. It frankly\r\nconcedes the existence of vice and superstition. But it believes\r\nthat the gospel of Jesus Christ is able to subdue that\r\nvice, and to dispel that superstition. So it founds schools and\r\ncolleges for the education of the young; establishes hospitals\r\nand dispensaries for the care of the sick and suffering; operates\r\nprinting-presses for the dissemination of the Bible and a Christian\r\nliterature; maintains churches for the worship of the true\r\nGod, and in and through all it preaches to lost men the transforming\r\nand uplifting gospel of Him who alone can ``speak\r\npeace to the heathen.''\r\n\r\nBut some are saying that the Boxer outbreak has destroyed\r\ntheir confidence in the practicability of the effort to evangelize\r\nthe Chinese. They are asking: ``Why should we send any\r\nmore missionaries to China?''\r\n\r\nI reply: ``Why send any more merchants, any more consuls,\r\nany more oil, flour, cotton? Shall we continue our commercial\r\nand political relations with China and discontinue our\r\nreligious relations; allow the lower influences to flow on unchecked,\r\nbut withhold the spiritual forces which would purify\r\ntrade and politics, which have made us what we are, and which\r\nalone can regenerate the millions of China?''\r\n\r\nIs disaster a reason for withdrawal? When the American\r\ncolonists found themselves involved in the horrors of the Revolution,\r\ndid they say that it would have been better to remain\r\nthe subjects of Great Britain? When, a generation ago,\r\nour land was drenched with the blood of the Civil War, did\r\nmen think that they ought to have tolerated secession and\r\nslavery? When the Maine was blown up in Havana Harbour\r\nand Lawton was killed in Luzon, did we demand withdrawal\r\nfrom Cuba and the Philippines? When Liscum fell under the\r\nwalls of Tien-tsin, did we insist that the attempt to relieve the\r\nLegations should be abandoned? Or did not the American\r\npeople, in every one of these instances, find in the very agonies\r\nof struggle and bloodshed a decisive reason for advance? Did\r\nthey not sternly resolve that there should be men, that there\r\nshould be money, and that the war should be pressed to victory\r\nwhatever the sacrifice that might be involved?\r\n\r\nAnd shall the Church of God weakly, timidly yield because\r\nthe very troubles have occurred which Christ Himself predicted?\r\nHe frankly said that there should ``be wars and\r\nrumors of wars''; that His disciples should ``be hated of all\r\nmen''; that He sent them ``forth as sheep in the midst of\r\nwolves,'' and that the brother should ``deliver up the brother\r\nto death and the father the child.'' But in that very discourse\r\nHe also said: ``He that taketh not his cross and followeth\r\nafter me is not worthy of me.'' ``Go, preach,'' He commanded.\r\n``Woe is me if I preach not,'' cried Paul. Hostile rulers and\r\npriests and mobs and the bitter Cross did not swerve Him a\r\nhairbreadth from His purpose; nor did the rending of the early\r\ndisciples in the arenas of Nero, the burning of a Huss and a\r\nSavonarola, the pyres of Smithfield, the dungeons of the\r\nTolbooth and the thumb-screws of the Inquisition quench the\r\nzeal of His followers.\r\n\r\nAnd in the like manner, the ashes of mission buildings and\r\nthe blood of devoted missionaries and the tumult of furious\r\nmen have led multitudes at home to form a high and holy resolve\r\nto send more missionaries, to give more money and to\r\npress the whole majestic enterprise with new faith and power\r\nuntil all China has been electrified by the vital spiritual force\r\nof a nobler faith. God summons Christendom to a forward\r\nmovement in the land whose soil has been forever consecrated\r\nby the martyrdom of the beloved dead. Instead of retreating,\r\n``we should,'' in the immortal words of Lincoln at Gettysburg,\r\n``be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us; that\r\nfrom these honoured dead we take increased devotion to that\r\ncause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion;\r\nthat we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died\r\nin vain.''\r\n\r\nIt may be said that this is a purely sentimental consideration.\r\nBut so may love for country, for liberty, for wife and children,\r\nbe called a sentiment. God forbid that the time should ever\r\ncome when men will not be influenced by sentiment. The intuitions\r\nof the heart are as apt to be correct as the dictates of the\r\nhead. I candidly admit that as I stood amid the ruins of the\r\nmission buildings in China, as I faced the surviving Christians\r\nand remembered what they had suffered, the property they had\r\nlost and the dear ones they had seen murdered,--as I stood with\r\nbared head on the spot where devoted missionaries had perished,\r\nI was conscious of a deeper consecration to the task of\r\nuplifting China. And I am not willing to admit that such a\r\ndedication of the living to the continuance of the work of the\r\ndead is a mere sentiment.\r\n\r\nWe are not wise above what is written when we declare that\r\nthe eternal purpose of God comprehends China as well as\r\nEurope and America. He did not create those hundreds of\r\nmillions of human beings simply to fertilize the soil in which\r\ntheir bodies will decay. He has not preserved China as a nation\r\nfor nearly half a hundred centuries for nothing. Out of\r\nthe apparent wreck, the new dispensation will come, is already\r\ncoming. Frightened men thought that the fall of Rome meant\r\nthe end of the world, but we can see that it only cleared the\r\nway for a better world. Pessimists feared that the violence and\r\nblood of the Crusades would ruin Europe, but instead they\r\nbroke up the stagnation of the Middle Ages and made possible\r\nthe rise of modern Europe. The faint-hearted said that the\r\nIndia mutiny of 1857 and the Syria massacres of 1860 ended\r\nall hope of regenerating those countries, but in both they ushered\r\nin the most successful era of missions.\r\n\r\nSo the barriers which have separated China from the rest of\r\nthe world must, like the medieval wall of Tien-tsin, be cast down\r\nand over them a highway for all men be made. No one sup-\r\nposed that the process would be so sudden and violent. But\r\nin the Boxer uprising the hammer of God did in months what\r\nwould otherwise have taken weary generations. Some were\r\ndiscouraged because the air was filled with the deafening tumult\r\nand the blinding dust and the flying debris. Many lost\r\nheart and wanted to sound a retreat because some of God's\r\nchosen ones were crushed in the awful rending. But the wiser\r\nand more far-seeing heard a new call to utilize the larger opportunity\r\nwhich resulted. Up to this time we have been playing\r\nwith foreign missions. It is now time for Christendom\r\nto understand that its great work in the twentieth century is to\r\nplan this movement on a scale gigantic in comparison with\r\nanything it has yet done, and to grapple intelligently, generously\r\nand resolutely, with the stupendous task of Christianizing\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nBut we are sometimes told that the churches should not be\r\nallowed to go on; that one of the conditions of good feeling\r\nwill be the exclusion of missionaries from China. On this\r\npoint, I venture three suggestions:--\r\n\r\nFirst,--No administration that can ever be elected in the\r\nUnited States will thus interfere with the liberty of the\r\nchurches. It will never say, in effect, that arms' manufacturing\r\ncompanies can send agents to Peking and distilleries send\r\ndrummers to Shanghai, but that the Church of God cannot\r\nsend devoted, intelligent men and women to found schools and\r\nhospitals and printing-presses and to preach the gospel of\r\nJesus Christ. It will never say that American gamblers in\r\nTien-tsin and American prostitutes in Hongkong shall be protected\r\nby all the might of the American army and navy, but\r\nthat the pure, high-minded missionary, who represents the\r\nnoblest motives and ideals of our American life, shall be expatriated,\r\na man without a country.\r\n\r\nThis is, however, a problem for the nation, rather than for\r\nthe boards. The American missionary went to Asia before his\r\nGovernment did, and until recently he saw very little of the\r\nAmerican flag. European nations have protected their citizens,\r\nwhether they were missionaries or traders. In the United\r\nStates Senate Mr. Frye once reminded the nation that about\r\ntwenty years ago England sent an army of 15,000 men down\r\nto the African coast, across 700 miles of burning sand, to batter\r\ndown iron gates and stone walls, reach down into an\r\nAbyssinian dungeon and lift out of it one British subject who\r\nhad been unlawfully imprisoned. It cost England $25,000,000\r\nto do it, but it made a highway over this planet for every common\r\nson of Britain, and the words, ``I am an English citizen,''\r\nmore potent than the sceptre of a king. And because of that\r\nreputation American missionaries have more than once been\r\nsaved by the intervention of British ministers and consuls who\r\nhave not forgotten that ``blood is thicker than water.'' Shall\r\nwe vociferously curse England one day and the next supinely\r\ndepend upon her representatives to help us out when our citizens\r\nare endangered?\r\n\r\nThis is not a question of ``jingoism,'' whatever that may be.\r\nIt is not a question of making unreasonable complaints to home\r\ngovernments. It is not a question of religion or of missions.\r\nIt is a question of treaties, of citizenship, of national honour\r\nand of self-respect. Let the nation settle it from that viewpoint.\r\nThe missionary asks no special privileges. He can\r\nstand it to go on as before, if the nation can stand it to have\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSecond,--If China should ever make such a demand in\r\nrepudiation of the treaties which she herself has expressly\r\nacknowledged to be valid, and if all the Powers should support\r\nher in that demand, does anybody doubt what the missionary\r\nwould say? We know at any rate what he has said in similar\r\ncircumstances. When Peter and John were scourged and forbidden\r\nto preach any more in the name of Jesus, friendless and penniless\r\nthough they were, they ringingly answered: ``Whether\r\nit be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than\r\nunto God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things\r\nwhich we have seen and heard.'' When Martin Luther was\r\narraigned before the most powerful tribunal in Europe, he declared:\r\n``Here I stand. God help me. I can do no other.''\r\nWhen the Russian Minister in Constantinople haughtily said to\r\nDr. Schauffler, ``My master, the Czar of all the Russias, will\r\nnot let you put foot on that territory,''--the intrepid missionary\r\nreplied: ``My Master, the Lord Jesus Christ, will never\r\nask the Czar of all the Russias where He shall put His foot.''\r\nScores of missionaries have not hesitated to say to hostile\r\nauthorities: ``I did not receive my commission from any earthly\r\npotentate but from the King of Kings, and I shall, I must go\r\non.''\r\n\r\nSome will say that this is madness. So of old men said of\r\nChrist, ``He hath a demon''; so they said of Paul, ``Thou\r\nart beside thyself.'' If magnificent moral courage and\r\nunyielding devotion to duty are ``madness,'' then the more the\r\nworld has of it the better.\r\n\r\nThe effort to minimize the significance of the missionary\r\nforce in China will be made only by those who, destitute of any\r\nvital religious faith themselves, of course see no reason for\r\ncommunicating it to others, or by those who are strangely blind\r\nand deaf to the real issues of the age. In the words of Benjamin\r\nKidd, ``it is not improbable that, to a future observer,\r\none of the most curious features of our time will appear to be\r\nthe prevailing unconsciousness of the real nature of the issues\r\nin the midst of which we are living.''\r\n\r\n\r\n``No more did the statesmen and the philosophers of Rome understand\r\nthe character and issues of that greatest movement of all history, of which\r\ntheir literature takes so little notice. That the greatest religious change\r\nin the history of mankind should have taken place under the eyes of a\r\nbrilliant galaxy of philosophers and historians who were profoundly conscious\r\nof decomposition around them; that all these writers should have\r\nutterly failed to predict the issue of the movement they were then observing;\r\nand that during the space of three centuries they should have treated\r\nas simply contemptible an agency which all men must now admit to have\r\nbeen, for good or evil, the most powerful moral lever that has ever been\r\napplied to the affairs of men, are facts well worthy of meditation in every\r\nperiod of religious transition.''[107]\r\n\r\n\r\n[107] Lecky, ``History of European Morals,'' Vol. 1, p. 359.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes any sane man imagine that the Church could cease to\r\nbe missionary and remain a Church? It has been well said\r\nthat the Christian nations might as well face the utter futility\r\nof any hypothesis based upon the supposition that they can\r\nremain away from the Orient. The occurrences of recent years\r\nhave made changes in their relation to the world which they can\r\nno more recall than they can alter the course of a planet. It is\r\nidle for doctrinaires to tell us from the quiet comfort of home\r\nlibraries, that we should ``keep hands off.'' We can no more\r\nkeep hands off than our country could keep hands off slavery\r\nin the South, no more than New York could keep hands off a\r\nborough infected with smallpox. The world has passed the\r\npoint where one-third of its population can be allowed to breed\r\nmiasma which the other two-thirds must breathe. Both for\r\nChina's sake and for our own, we must continue this work. If\r\nthis is true in the political and commercial realms, much more\r\nis it true in the religious. Chalmer's notable sermon on the\r\n``Expulsive Power of a New Affection'' enunciates a permanent\r\nprinciple. When a man's soul is once thrilled with the\r\nconviction that he has found God, he must declare that sublime\r\ntruth,\r\n\r\n   ``To doubt would be disloyalty,\r\n   To falter would be sin.''\r\n\r\n\r\nI confess to a feeling of impatience when I am told that all\r\nmissionary plans for China must be contingent ``upon the\r\nsettlement of political negotiations,'' ``the overthrow of the\r\nEmpress Dowager and her reactionary advisers,'' ``the reestablishment\r\nof the Emperor on his rightful throne,'' ``the continuance\r\nin power of Viceroy Yuan Shih Kai,'' ``the mainte-\r\nnance of a strong foreign military and naval force in China,''\r\n``the thwarting of Russia's plans for supremacy,'' and several\r\nother events.\r\n\r\nAll these things have been said and more. Is the Church\r\nthen despairingly to resign her commission from Jesus Christ\r\nand humbly ask a new one from Caesar? Not so did the\r\napostolic missionaries, and not so, I am persuaded, will their\r\nmodern successors do. They cannot, indeed, be indifferent to\r\nthe course of political events or to their bearing upon the\r\nmissionary problem. But, on the other hand, they cannot\r\nmake their obedience to Christ and their duty to their fellow men\r\ndependent upon political considerations. For Christian men\r\nto wait until China is pacified by the Powers, or ``until she is\r\nenlightened by the dissemination of truer conceptions of the\r\nWestern world,'' would be to abdicate their responsibility as\r\nthe chief factor in bringing about a better state of affairs. Is\r\nthe Church prepared to abandon the field to the diplomat, the\r\nsoldier, the trader? How soon is China likely to be pacified\r\nby them, judging from their past acts? The gospel is the\r\nprimary need of China to-day, not the tertiary. The period\r\nof unrest is not the time for the messenger of Christ to hold\r\nhis peace, but to declare with new zeal and fidelity his ministry\r\nof reconciliation. To leave the field to the politician, the\r\nsoldier and the trader would be to dishonour Christ, to fail to\r\nutilize an unprecedented opportunity, to abandon the Chinese\r\nChristians in their hour of special need and to prejudice missionary\r\ninfluence at home and abroad for a generation.\r\n\r\nBut the numbers at work are painfully inadequate. To say\r\nthat there are 2,950 Protestant foreign missionaries in China is\r\napt to give a distorted idea of the real situation unless one\r\nremembers the immensity of the population. A station is considered\r\nwell-manned when it has four families and a couple\r\nof single women. But what are they among those swarming\r\nmyriads? The proportion of Protestant missionaries to the\r\npopulation, which is commonly quoted, needs revision. There\r\nis one to about every 144,000 souls. But that, too, requires\r\nmodification, for it counts the sick, the aged, recruits who are\r\nlearning the language, wives whose time is absorbed by household\r\ncares, and those who are absent on furloughs, the last\r\nclass alone being often about ten per cent. of the total enrollment.\r\nThe actual working force, therefore, is far smaller than\r\nthe statistics suggest.\r\n\r\nOf China as a whole, it is said that ``some of the missionaries\r\nand some of the converts are to be found in every one of\r\nthe provinces, both of China and Manchuria. But in the\r\n1,900 odd counties into which the provinces are divided, each\r\nwith one important town and a large part of them with more\r\nthan one, there are but some 400 stations. That is to say, at\r\nleast four-fifths of the counties of China are almost entirely\r\nunprovided with the means of hearing the gospel.''[108] Of all the\r\nwalled cities in the Empire, less than 300 are occupied by missionaries.\r\nThere are literally tens of thousands of communities\r\nthat have not yet been touched by the gospel. Plainly, the\r\nmissionary force must be largely augmented if the work is to\r\nbe adequately done. The home churches have gone too far to\r\nstop without going farther. ``Those who undertake to carry\r\non mission work among great peoples undertake great responsibilities.\r\nWe have no right to penetrate these nations with a\r\nrevolutionary gospel of enormous power, unless we are prepared\r\nto make every sacrifice and every effort for the proper care and\r\nthe wise training of the organization of the Christian community\r\nitself which, while it must become increasingly a source\r\nof revolutionary thought and movement, is also the only body\r\nthat can by the help and grace of God give these far-reaching\r\nmovements a healthy direction and lead them to safe and happy\r\nissues.''[109]\r\n\r\n\r\n[108] ``China's Call for a Three Years' Enterprise,'' 1903.\r\n\r\n[109] Gibson, p. 277.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrant that the work of evangelization must be chiefly done\r\nby Chinese preachers; there is still much for the missionary to\r\ndo. Allowing for those who, on account of illness, furlough or\r\nother duties, are temporarily non-effective, 10,000 missionaries\r\nfor China would not give a working average of one for every\r\n50,000 of the population. In these circumstances, the union\r\nconference of missionaries at Kuling, August 7, 1903, was\r\nsurely within reasonable bounds when, in urging the Protestant\r\nchurches to celebrate in 1907 the one hundredth anniversary\r\nof the sending forth of Robert Morrison, it declared:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``. . . In view of the vastness of the field that lies open before us,\r\nand of the immense opportunities for good which China offers the Christian\r\nChurch--opportunities so many of which have been quite recently\r\nopened to us and which were won by the blood of the martyrs of 1900--\r\nwe appeal to the boards and committees of our respective societies, and\r\nindividually to all our brethren and sisters in the home churches, to say if we\r\nare unreasonable in asking that the last object of the Three Years'\r\nEnterprise be to double the number of missionaries now working in\r\nChina.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time has come to ``attempt great things for God, expect\r\ngreat things from God.'' When in 1806, those five\r\nstudents in Williamstown, Massachusetts, held that immortal\r\nconference in the lee of a haystack, talked of the mighty task of\r\nworld evangelization and wondered whether it could be accomplished,\r\nit was given to Samuel J. Mills to cry out: ``We\r\ncan if we will!'' And the little company took up the cry and\r\nliterally shouted it to the heavens: ``We can if we will!''\r\n``A growing church among a strong people burdened by a\r\ndecadent Empire--the spirit of life working against the forces\r\nof death and decay in the one great Pagan Empire which the\r\nwrecks of millenniums have left on the earth--surely there is a\r\ncall to service that might fire the spirit of the dullest of us.''[110]\r\nThe obstacles are indeed formidable, but he who can look beneath\r\nthe eddying flotsam and jetsam of the surface to the\r\nmighty undercurrents which are sweeping majestically onward\r\ncan exclaim with Gladstone:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``Time is on our side. The great social forces which move onward in\r\ntheir might and majesty, and which the tumults of these strifes do not for\r\na moment impede or disturb--those forces are marshalled in our support.\r\nAnd the banner which we now carry in the fight, though perhaps at some\r\nmoment of the struggle it may droop over our sinking hearts, yet will\r\nfloat again in the eye of heaven and will be borne, perhaps not to an easy,\r\nbut to a certain and to a not distant victory.''[111]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[110] Gibson, p. 331.\r\n\r\n[111] Speech on the Reform Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a famous art gallery, there is a famous painting called\r\n``Anno Domini.'' It represents an Egyptian temple, from\r\nwhose spacious courts a brilliant procession of soldiers, statesmen,\r\nphilosophers, artists, musicians and priests is advancing\r\nin triumphal march, bearing a huge idol, the challenge and the\r\nboast of heathenism. Across the pathway of the procession is\r\nan ass, whose bridle is held by a reverent looking man and\r\nupon whose back is a fair young mother with her infant child.\r\nIt is Jesus, entering Egypt in flight from the wrath of Herod,\r\nand thus crossing the path of aggressive heathenism. Then\r\nthe clock strikes and the Christian era begins.\r\n\r\nIt is a noble parable. Its fulfillment has been long delayed\r\ntill the Child has become a Man, crucified, risen, crowned.\r\nBut now in majesty and power, He stands across the pathway\r\nof advancing heathenism in China. There may be confusion\r\nand tumult for a time. The heathen may rage, ``and the\r\nrulers take counsel together against the Lord.'' But the idol\r\nshall be broken ``with a rod of iron,'' and the King upon his\r\nholy hill shall have ``the heathen for `his' inheritance and the\r\nuttermost parts of the earth for `his' possession.''\r\n\r\nFor a consummation so majestic in its character and so vital\r\nto the welfare not only of China but of the whole human race\r\nwe may well make our own the organ-voiced invocation of\r\nMilton:--\r\n\r\n\r\n``Come, O Thou that hast the seven stars in Thy right hand,\r\nappoint Thy chosen priests according to their order and courses\r\nof old, to minister before Thee, and duly to dress and pour out\r\nthe consecrated oil into Thy holy and ever burning lamps.\r\nThou hast sent out the spirit of prayer upon Thy servants over\r\nall the earth to this effect, and stored up their voices as the\r\nsound of many waters about Thy throne. . . . O perfect\r\nand accomplish Thy glorious acts; for men may leave their\r\nworks unfinished, but Thou art a God; Thy nature is perfection.\r\n. . . The times and seasons pass along under Thy\r\nfeet, to go and come at Thy bidding; and as Thou didst\r\ndignify our fathers' days with many revelations, above all their\r\nforegoing ages since Thou tookest the flesh, so Thou canst\r\nvouchsafe to us, though unworthy, as large a portion of Thy\r\nSpirit as Thou pleasest; for who shall prejudice Thy all-governing\r\nwill? Seeing the power of Thy grace is not passed\r\naway with the primitive times, as fond and faithless men\r\nimagine, but Thy kingdom is now at hand, and Thou standing\r\nat the door, come forth out of Thy royal chambers, O Prince\r\nof all the kings of the earth; put on the visible robes of Thy\r\nimperial majesty, take up that unlimited sceptre which Thy Almighty\r\nFather hath bequeathed Thee; for now the voice of\r\nThy bride calls Thee, and all creatures sigh to be renewed.''[112]\r\n\r\n\r\n[112] Milton, ``Prose Works.''\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n{Raw OCR from here to the end, needs proof-read and formatted}\r\n\r\nABRAHAM, 39\r\nAbyssinia, 363\r\nAcademy, Military, 339\r\nAchievements of Chinese, 39sq.\r\nAfrica, 16, 19, 102, 106, 107, 108,\r\n126, 128, 175, 314\r\nAgnew, Rev.
