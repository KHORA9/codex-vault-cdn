The excitement of the People was\r\nunparalleled.  The Republicans of the North rejoiced that at last the\r\ngreat wrong of Slavery was to be placed \"where the People could rest in\r\nthe belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction!\"  The\r\nDouglas Democracy, naturally chagrined at the defeat of their great\r\nleader, were filled with gloomy forebodings touching the future of their\r\nCountry; and the Southern Democracy, or at least a large portion of it,\r\nopenly exulted that at last the long-wished-for opportunity for a revolt\r\nof the Slave Power, and a separation of the Slave from the Free States,\r\nwas at hand.  Especially in South Carolina were the \"Fire-eating\"\r\nSouthrons jubilant over the event.\r\n\r\n     [\"South Carolina rejoiced over the election of Lincoln, with\r\n     bonfires and processions.\"  p. 172, Arnold's \"Life of Abraham\r\n     Lincoln.\"\r\n\r\n     \"There was great joy in Charleston, and wherever 'Fire Eaters' most\r\n     did congregate, on the morning of November 7th.  Men rushed to\r\n     shake hands and congratulate each other on the glad tidings of\r\n     Lincoln's election.  * * *  Men thronged the streets, talking,\r\n     laughing, cheering, like mariners long becalmed on a hateful,\r\n     treacherous sea, whom a sudden breeze had swiftly wafted within\r\n     sight of their longed-for haven.\"  p. 332, vol. i., Greeley's\r\n     American Conflict.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile any number of joint resolutions looking to the calling of a\r\nSecession Convention, were introduced in the South Carolina Legislature,\r\nsitting at Columbia, having in view Secession contingent upon the\r\n\"cooperation\" of the other Slave States, or looking to immediate and\r\n\"unconditional\" Secession.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of November 7th, Edmund Ruffin of Virginia--a Secession\r\nfanatic who had come from thence in hot haste--in response to a\r\nserenade, declared to the people of Columbia that: \"The defense of the\r\nSouth, he verily believed, was only to be secured through the lead of\r\nSouth Carolina;\" that, \"old as he was, he had come here to join them in\r\nthat lead;\" and that \"every day delayed, was a day lost to the Cause.\"\r\nHe acknowledged that Virginia was \"not as ready as South Carolina;\" but\r\ndeclared that \"The first drop of blood spilled on the soil of South\r\nCarolina would bring Virginia, and every Southern State, with them.\"  He\r\nthought \"it was perhaps better that Virginia, and all other border\r\nStates, remain quiescent for a time, to serve as a guard against the\r\nNorth.  * * *  By remaining in the Union for a time, she would not only\r\nprevent coercive legislation in Congress, but any attempt for our\r\nsubjugation.\"\r\n\r\nThat same evening came news that, at Charleston, the Grand Jury of the\r\nUnited States District Court had refused to make any presentments,\r\nbecause of the Presidential vote just cast, which, they said, had \"swept\r\naway the last hope for the permanence, for the stability, of the Federal\r\nGovernment of these Sovereign States;\" and that United States District\r\nJudge Magrath had resigned his office, saying to the Grand Jury, as he\r\ndid so: \"In the political history of the United States, an event has\r\nhappened of ominous import to fifteen Slave-holding States.  The State\r\nof which we are citizens has been always understood to have deliberately\r\nfixed its purpose whenever that event should happen.  Feeling an\r\nassurance of what will be the action of the State, I consider it my\r\nduty, without delay, to prepare to obey its wishes.  That preparation is\r\nmade by the resignation of the office I have held.\"\r\n\r\nThe news of the resignations of the Federal Collector and District\r\nAttorney at Charleston, followed, with an intimation that that of the\r\nSub-Treasurer would soon be forthcoming.  On November 9th, a joint\r\nresolution calling an unconditional Secession Convention to meet at\r\nColumbia December 17th, was passed by the Senate, and on the 12th of\r\nNovember went through the House; and both of the United States Senators\r\nfrom South Carolina had now resigned their seats in the United States\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nBesides all these and many other incitements to Secession was the fact\r\nthat at Milledgeville, Georgia, Governor Brown had, November 12th,\r\naddressed a Georgian Military Convention, affirming \"the right of\r\nSecession, and the duty of other Southern States to sustain South\r\nCarolina in the step she was then taking,\" and declaring that he \"would\r\nlike to see Federal troops dare attempt the coercion of a seceding\r\nSouthern State!  For every Georgian who fell in a conflict thus incited,\r\nthe lives of two Federal Soldiers should expiate the outrage on State\r\nSovereignty\"--and that the Convention aforesaid had most decisively\r\ngiven its voice for Secession.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time, however, that Alexander H.  Stephens vainly\r\nsought to stem the tide of Secession in his own State, in a speech\r\n(November 14) before the Georgia Legislature, in which he declared that\r\nMr. Lincoln \"can do nothing unless he is backed by power in Congress.\r\nThe House of Representatives is largely in the majority against him.  In\r\nthe Senate he will also be powerless.  There will be a majority of four\r\nagainst him.\"  He also cogently said: \"Many of us have sworn to support\r\nit (the Constitution).  Can we, therefore, for the mere election of a\r\nman to the Presidency--and that too, in accordance with the prescribed\r\nforms of the Constitution--make a point of resistance to the Government,\r\nand, without becoming the breakers of that sacred instrument ourselves,\r\nwithdraw ourselves from it?  Would we not be in the wrong?\"\r\n\r\nBut the occasional words of wisdom that fell from the lips of the few\r\nfar-seeing statesmen of the South, were as chaff before the storm of\r\nDisunion raised by the turbulent Fire-eaters, and were blown far from\r\nthe South, where they might have done some good for the Union cause,\r\naway up to the North, where they contributed to aid the success of the\r\ncontemplated Treason and Rebellion, by lulling many of the people there,\r\ninto a false sense of security.  Unfortunately, also, even the ablest of\r\nthe Southern Union men were so tainted with the heretical doctrine of\r\nStates-Rights, which taught the \"paramount allegiance\" of the citizen to\r\nthe State, that their otherwise powerful appeals for the preservation of\r\nthe Union were almost invariably handicapped by the added protestation\r\nthat in any event--and however they might deplore the necessity--they\r\nwould, if need be, go with their State, against their own convictions of\r\nduty to the National Union.\r\n\r\nHence in this same speech we find that Mr. Stephens destroyed the whole\r\neffect of his weighty and logical appeal against Secession from the\r\nUnion, by adding to it, that, \"Should Georgia determine to go out of the\r\nUnion I shall bow to the will of her people.  Their cause is my cause,\r\nand their destiny is my destiny; and I trust this will be the ultimate\r\ncourse of all.\"--and by further advising the calling of a Convention of\r\nthe people to decide the matter; thus, in advance, as it were, binding\r\nhimself hand and foot, despite his previous Union utterances, to do the\r\nfell bidding of the most rampant Disunionists.  And thus, in due time,\r\nit befell, as we shall see, that this \"saving clause\" in his \"Union\r\nspeech,\" brought him at the end, not to that posture of patriotic\r\nheroism to which he aspired when he adjured his Georgian auditors to\r\n\"let us be found to the last moment standing on the deck (of the\r\nRepublic), with the Constitution of the United States waving over our\r\nheads,\" but to that of an imprisoned traitor and defeated rebel against\r\nthe very Republic and Constitution which he had sworn to uphold and\r\ndefend!\r\n\r\nThe action of the South Carolina Legislature in calling an Unconditional\r\nSecession Convention, acted among the Southern States like a spark in a\r\ntrain of gunpowder.  Long accustomed to incendiary resolutions of\r\nPro-Slavery political platforms, as embodying the creed of Southern men;\r\ncommitted by those declarations to the most extreme action when, in\r\ntheir judgment, the necessity should arise; and worked up during the\r\nPresidential campaign by swarming Federal officials inspired by the\r\nfanatical Secession leaders; the entire South only needed the spark from\r\nthe treasonable torch of South Carolina, to find itself ablaze, almost\r\nfrom one end to the other, with the flames of revolt.\r\n\r\nGovernor after Governor, in State after State, issued proclamation after\r\nproclamation, calling together their respective Legislatures, to\r\nconsider the situation and whether their respective States should join\r\nSouth Carolina in seceding from the Union.  Kentucky alone, of them all,\r\nseemed for a time to keep cool, and look calmly and reasonably through\r\nthe Southern ferment to the horrors beyond.  In an address issued by\r\nGovernor Magoffin of that State, to the people, he said:\r\n\r\n\"To South Carolina and such other States as may wish to secede from the\r\nUnion, I would say: The geography of this Country will not admit of a\r\ndivision; the mouth and sources of the Mississippi River cannot be\r\nseparated without the horrors of Civil War.  We cannot sustain you in\r\nthis movement merely on account of the election of Mr. Lincoln.  Do not\r\nprecipitate by premature action into a revolution or Civil War, the\r\nconsequences of which will be most frightful to all of us.  It may yet\r\nbe avoided.  There is still hope, faint though it be.  Kentucky is a\r\nBorder State, and has suffered more than all of you.  * * *  She has a\r\nright to claim that her voice, and the voice of reason, and moderation\r\nand patriotism shall be heard and heeded by you.  If you secede, your\r\nrepresentatives will go out of Congress and leave us at the mercy of a\r\nBlack Republican Government.  Mr. Lincoln will have no check.  He can\r\nappoint his Cabinet, and have it confirmed.  The Congress will then be\r\nRepublican, and he will be able to pass such laws as he may suggest.\r\nThe Supreme Court will be powerless to protect us.  We implore you to\r\nstand by us, and by our friends in the Free States; and let us all, the\r\nbold, the true, and just men in the Free and Slave States, with a united\r\nfront, stand by each other, by our principles, by our rights, our\r\nequality, our honor, and by the Union under the Constitution.  I believe\r\nthis is the only way to save it; and we can do it.\"\r\n\r\nBut this \"still small voice\" of conscience and of reason, heard like a\r\nwhisper from the mouths of Stephens in Georgia, and Magoffin in\r\nKentucky, was drowned in the clamor and tumult of impassioned harangues\r\nand addresses, and the drumming and tramp of the \"minute men\" of South\r\nCarolina, and other military organizations, as they excitedly prepared\r\nthroughout the South for the dread conflict at arms which they\r\nrecklessly invited, and savagely welcomed.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how President Andrew Jackson some thirty years before, had\r\nstamped out Nullification and Disunion in South Carolina, with an iron\r\nheel.\r\n\r\nBut a weak and feeble old man--still suffering from the effects of the\r\nmysterious National Hotel poisoning--was now in the Executive Chair at\r\nthe White House.  Well-meaning, doubtless, and a Union man at heart, his\r\nenfeebled intellect was unable to see, and hold firm to, the only true\r\ncourse.  He lacked clearness of perception, decision of character, and\r\nnerve.  He knew Secession was wrong, but allowed himself to be persuaded\r\nthat he had no Constitutional power to prevent it.  He had surrounded\r\nhimself in the Cabinet with such unbending adherents and tools of the\r\nSlave-Power, as Howell Cobb of Georgia, his Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nJohn B. Floyd of Virginia, as Secretary of War, Jacob Thompson of\r\nMississippi, as Secretary of the Interior, and Isaac Toucy of\r\nConnecticut, as Secretary of the Navy, before whose malign influence the\r\ncouncils of Lewis Cass of Michigan, the Secretary of State, and other\r\nUnion men, in and out of the Cabinet, were quite powerless.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the Congress met (December 3, 1860) and he transmitted\r\nto it his last Annual Message, it was found that, instead of treating\r\nSecession from the Jacksonian standpoint, President Buchanan feebly\r\nwailed over the threatened destruction of the Union, weakly apologized\r\nfor the contemplated Treason, garrulously scolded the North as being to\r\nblame for it, and, while praying to God to \"preserve the Constitution\r\nand the Union throughout all generations,\" wrung his nerveless hands in\r\ndespair over his own powerlessness--as he construed the Constitution--to\r\nprevent Secession!  Before writing his pitifully imbecile Message,\r\nPresident Buchanan had secured from his Attorney-General (Jeremiah S.\r\nBlack of Pennsylvania) an opinion, in which the latter, after touching\r\nupon certain cases in which he believed the President would be justified\r\nin using force to sustain the Federal Laws, supposed the case of a State\r\nwhere all the Federal Officers had resigned and where there were neither\r\nFederal Courts to issue, nor officers to execute judicial process, and\r\ncontinued: \"In that event, troops would certainly be out of place, and\r\ntheir use wholly illegal.  If they are sent to aid the Courts and\r\nMarshals there must be Courts and Marshals to be aided.  Without the\r\nexercise of these functions, which belong exclusively to the civil\r\nservice, the laws cannot be executed in any event, no matter what may be\r\nthe physical strength which the Government has at its command.  Under\r\nsuch circumstances, to send a military force into any State, with orders\r\nto act against the people, would be simply making War upon them.\"\r\n\r\nResting upon that opinion of Attorney-General Black, President Buchanan,\r\nin his Message, after referring to the solemn oath taken by the\r\nExecutive \"to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,\" and\r\nstating that there were now no longer any Federal Officers in South\r\nCarolina, through whose agency he could keep that oath, took up the laws\r\nof February 28, 1795, and March 3, 1807, as \"the only Acts of Congress\r\non the Statute-book bearing upon the subject,\" which \"authorize the\r\nPresident, after he shall have ascertained that the Marshal, with his\r\nposse comitatus, is unable to execute civil or criminal process in any\r\nparticular case, to call out the Militia and employ the Army and Navy to\r\naid him in performing this service, having first, by Proclamation,\r\ncommanded the insurgents to 'disperse and retire peaceably to their\r\nrespective abodes, within a limited time'\"--and thereupon held that\r\n\"This duty cannot, by possibility, be performed in a State where no\r\njudicial authority exists to issue process, and where there is no\r\nMarshal to execute it; and where even if there were such an officer, the\r\nentire population would constitute one solid combination to resist him.\"\r\nAnd, not satisfied with attempting to show as clearly as he seemed to\r\nknow how, his own inability under the laws to stamp out Treason, he\r\nproceeded to consider what he thought Congress also could not do under\r\nthe Constitution.  Said he: \"The question fairly stated, is: Has the\r\nConstitution delegated to Congress the power to coerce into submission a\r\nState which is attempting to withdraw, or has actually withdrawn, from\r\nthe Confederacy?  If answered in the affirmative, it must be on the\r\nprinciple that the power has been conferred upon Congress to declare and\r\nmake War against a State.  After much serious reflection, I have arrived\r\nat the conclusion that no such power has been delegated to Congress or\r\nto any other department of the Federal Government.\"  And further:\r\n\"Congress possesses many means of preserving it (the Union) by\r\nconciliation; but the sword was not placed in their hands to preserve it\r\nby force.\"\r\n\r\nThus, in President Buchanan's judgment, while, in another part of his\r\nMessage, he had declared that no State had any right, Constitutional or\r\notherwise, to Secede from that Union, which was designed for all time\r\n--yet, if any State concluded thus wrongfully to Secede, there existed no\r\npower in the Union, by the exercise of force, to preserve itself from\r\ninstant dissolution!  How imbecile the reasoning, how impotent the\r\nconclusion, compared with that of President Jackson, thirty years\r\nbefore, in his Proclamation against Nullification and Secession, wherein\r\nthat sturdy patriot declared to the South Carolinians.  that \"compared\r\nto Disunion, all other evils are light, because that brings with it an\r\naccumulation of all;\" that \"Disunion by armed force, is Treason;\" and\r\nthat he was determined \"to execute the Laws,\" and \"to preserve the\r\nUnion!\"\r\n\r\nPresident Buchanan's extraordinary Message--or so much of it as related\r\nto the perilous condition of the Union--was referred, in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, to a Select Committee of Thirty-three, comprising one\r\nmember from each State, in which there was a very large preponderance of\r\nsuch as favored Conciliation without dishonor.  But the debates in both\r\nHouses, in which the most violent language was indulged by the Southern\r\nFire-eaters, as well as other events, soon proved that there was a\r\nsettled purpose on the part of the Slave-Power and its adherents to\r\nresist and spit upon all attempts at placation.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate also (December 5), a Select Committee of Thirteen was\r\nappointed, to consider the impending dangers to the Union, comprising\r\nSenators Powell of Kentucky, Hunter of Virginia, Crittenden of Kentucky,\r\nSeward of New York, Toombs of Georgia, Douglas of Illinois, Collamer of\r\nVermont, Davis of Mississippi, Wade of Ohio, Bigler of Pennsylvania,\r\nRice of Minnesota, Doolittle of Wisconsin, and Grimes of Iowa.  Their\r\nlabors were alike without practical result, owing to the irreconcilable\r\nattitude of the Southrons, who would accept nothing less than a total\r\nrepudiation by the Republicans of the very principles upon which the\r\nrecent Presidential contest had by them been fought and won.  Nor would\r\nthey even accept such a repudiation unless carried by vote of the\r\nmajority of the Republicans.  The dose that they insisted upon the\r\nRepublican Party swallowing must not only be as noxious as possible, but\r\nmust absolutely be mixed by that Party itself, and in addition, that\r\nParty must also go down on its knees, and beg the privilege of so mixing\r\nand swallowing the dose!  That was the impossible attitude into which,\r\nby their bullying and threats, the Slave Power hoped to force the\r\nRepublican Party--either that or \"War.\"\r\n\r\nProject after project in both Houses of Congress looking to Conciliation\r\nwas introduced, referred, reported, discussed, and voted on or not, as\r\nthe case might be, in vain.  And in the meantime, in New York, in\r\nPhiladelphia, and elsewhere in the North, the timidity of Capital showed\r\nitself in great Conciliation meetings, where speeches were applauded and\r\nresolutions adopted of the most abject character, in behalf of \"Peace,\r\nat any price,\" regardless of the sacrifice of honor and principles and\r\neven decency.  In fact the Commercial North, with supplicating hands and\r\nbeseeching face, sank on its knees in a vain attempt to propitiate its\r\nfurious creditor, the South, by asking it not only to pull its nose, but\r\nto spit in its face, both of which it humbly and even anxiously offered\r\nfor the purpose!*\r\n\r\n     [Thus, in Philadelphia, December 13, 1860, at a great meeting held\r\n     at the call of the Mayor, in Independence Square, Mayor Henry led\r\n     off the speaking--which was nearly all in the same line-by saying:\r\n     \"I tell you that if in any portion of our Confederacy, sentiments\r\n     have been entertained and cherished which are inimical to the civil\r\n     rights and social institutions of any other portion, those\r\n     sentiments should be relinquished.\"  Another speaker, Judge George\r\n     W. Woodward, sneeringly asked: \"Whence came these excessive\r\n     sensibilities that cannot bear a few slaves in a remote Territory\r\n     until the white people establish a Constitution?\"  Another, Mr.\r\n     Charles E. Lex (a Republican), speaking of the Southern People,\r\n     said: \"What, then, can we say to them? what more than we have\r\n     expressed in the resolutions we have offered?  If they are really\r\n     aggrieved by any laws upon our Statute-books opposed to their\r\n     rights--if upon examination any such are found to be in conflict\r\n     with the Constitution of these United States--nay, further, if they\r\n     but serve to irritate our brethren of the South, whether\r\n     Constitutional or not, I, for one, have no objection that they\r\n     should instantly be repealed.\"  Another said, \"Let us repeal our\r\n     obnoxious Personal Liberty bills * * *; let us receive our brother\r\n     of the South, if he will come among us for a little time, attended\r\n     by his servant, and permit him thus to come.\"  And the resolutions\r\n     adopted were even still more abject in tone than the speeches.]\r\n\r\nBut the South at present was too busy in perfecting its long-cherished\r\nplans for the disruption of the Union, to more than grimly smile at this\r\nevidence of what it chose to consider \"a divided sentiment\" in the\r\nNorth.  While it weakened the North, it strengthened the South, and\r\ninstead of mollifying the Conspirators against the Union, it inspired\r\nthem with fresh energy in their fell purpose to destroy it.\r\n\r\nThe tone of the Republican press, too, while more dignified, was\r\nthoroughly conciliatory.  The Albany Evening Journal,--[November 30,\r\n1860]--the organ of Governor Seward, recognizing that the South, blinded\r\nby passion, was in dead earnest, but also recognizing the existence of\r\n\"a Union sentiment there, worth cherishing,\" suggested \"a Convention of\r\nthe People, consisting of delegates appointed by the States, in which it\r\nwould not be found unprofitable for the North and South, bringing their\r\nrespective griefs, claims, and proposed reforms, to a common\r\narbitrament, to meet, discuss, and determine upon a future\"--before a\r\nfinal appeal to arms.  So, too, Horace Greeley, in the New York\r\nTribune,--[November 9, 1860.]--after weakly conceding, on his own part,\r\nthe right of peaceable Secession, said: \"But while we thus uphold the\r\npractical liberty, if not the abstract right, of Secession, we must\r\ninsist that the step be taken, if it ever shall be, with the\r\ndeliberation and gravity befitting so momentous an issue.  Let ample\r\ntime be given for reflection; let the subject be fully canvassed before\r\nthe People; and let a popular vote be taken in every case, before\r\nSecession is decreed.\"  Other leading papers of the Northern press, took\r\nsimilar ground for free discussion and conciliatory action.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate, as well as the House of Representatives--as also was\r\nshown by the appointment, heretofore mentioned, of Select Committees to\r\nconsider the gravity of the situation, and suggest a remedy--the same\r\nspirit of Conciliation and Concession, and desire for free and frank\r\ndiscussion, was apparent among most of the Northern and Border-State\r\nmembers of those Bodies.  But these were only met by sneers and threats\r\non the part of the Fire-eating Secession members of the South.  In the\r\nSenate, Senator Clingman of North Carolina, sneeringly said: \"They want\r\nto get up a free debate, as the Senator (Mr. Seward) from New York\r\nexpressed it, in one of his speeches.  But a Senator from Texas told me\r\nthe other day that a great many of these free debaters were hanging from\r\nthe trees of that country;\" and Senator Iverson, of Georgia, said:\r\n\"Gentlemen speak of Concession, of the repeal of the Personal Liberty\r\nbills.  Repeal them all to-morrow, and you cannot stop this revolution.\"\r\nAfter declaring his belief that \"Before the 4th of March, five States\r\nwill have declared their independence\" and that \"three other States will\r\nfollow as soon as the action of the people can be had;\" he proceeded to\r\nallude to the refusal of Governor Houston of Texas to call together the\r\nTexas Legislature for action in accord with the Secession sentiment, and\r\ndeclared that \"if he will not yield to that public sentiment, some Texan\r\nBrutus will arise to rid his country of this hoary-headed incubus that\r\nstands between the people and their sovereign will!\"  Then, sneering at\r\nthe presumed cowardice of the North, he continued: \"Men talk about their\r\neighteen millions (of Northern population); but we hear a few days\r\nafterwards of these same men being switched in the face, and they\r\ntremble like sheep-stealing dogs!  There will be no War.  The North,\r\ngoverned by such far-seeing Statesmen as the Senator (Mr. Seward) from\r\nNew York, will see the futility of this.  In less than twelve months, a\r\nSouthern Confederacy will be formed; and it will be the most successful\r\nGovernment on Earth.  The Southern States, thus banded together, will be\r\nable to resist any force in the World.  We do not expect War; but we\r\nwill be prepared for it--and we are not a feeble race of Mexicans\r\neither.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there were Republicans in that Body who sturdily met\r\nthe bluster of the Southern Fire-eaters with frank and courageous words\r\nexpressing their full convictions on the situation and their belief that\r\nConcessions could not be made and that Compromises were mere waste\r\npaper.  Thus, Senator Ben Wade of Ohio, among the bravest and manliest\r\nof them all, in a speech in the Senate, December 17, the very day on\r\nwhich the South Carolina Secession Convention was to assemble, said to\r\nthe Fire-eaters: \"I tell you frankly that we did lay down the principle\r\nin our platform, that we would prohibit, if we had the power, Slavery\r\nfrom invading another inch of the Free Soil of this Government.  I stand\r\nto that principle to-day.  I have argued it to half a million of people,\r\nand they stand by it; they have commissioned me to stand by it; and, so\r\nhelp me God, I will! * * *  On the other hand, our platform repudiates\r\nthe idea that we have any right, or harbor any ultimate intention to\r\ninvade or interfere with your institutions in your own States.  * * *\r\nIt is not, by your own confessions, that Mr. Lincoln is expected to\r\ncommit any overt act by which you may be injured.  You will not even\r\nwait for any, you say; but, by anticipating that the Government may do\r\nyou an injury, you will put an end to it--which means, simply and\r\nsquarely, that you intend to rule or ruin this Government.  * * *  As to\r\nCompromises, I supposed that we had agreed that the Day of Compromises\r\nwas at an end.  The most solemn we have made have been violated, and are\r\nno more.  * * *  We beat you on the plainest and most palpable issue\r\never presented to the American people, and one which every man\r\nunderstood; and now, when we come to the Capital, we tell you that our\r\ncandidates must and shall be inaugurated--must and shall administer this\r\nGovernment precisely as the Constitution prescribes.  * * *  I tell you\r\nthat, with that verdict of the people in my pocket, and standing on the\r\nplatform on which these candidates were elected, I would suffer anything\r\nbefore I would Compromise in any way.\"\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives, on December 10, 1860, a number of\r\npropositions looking to a peaceful settlement of the threatened danger,\r\nwere offered and referred to the Select Committee of Thirty-three.  On\r\nthe following Monday, December 17, by 154 yeas to 14 nays, the House\r\nadopted a resolution, offered by Mr. Adrian of New Jersey, in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That we deprecate the spirit of disobedience to the\r\nConstitution, wherever manifested; and that we earnestly recommend the\r\nrepeal of all Statutes by the State Legislatures in conflict with, and\r\nin violation of, that sacred instrument, and the laws of Congress passed\r\nin pursuance thereof.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same day, the House adopted, by 135 yeas to no nays, a resolution\r\noffered by Mr. Lovejoy of Illinois, in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, The Constitution of the United States is the Supreme law of\r\nthe Land, and ready and faithful obedience to it a duty of all good and\r\nlaw-abiding citizens; Therefore:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That we deprecate the spirit of disobedience to the\r\nConstitution, wherever manifested; and that we earnestly recommend the\r\nrepeal of all Nullification laws; and that it is the duty of the\r\nPresident of the United States to protect and defend the property of the\r\nUnited States.\"\r\n\r\n     [This resolution, before adoption, was modified by declaring it to\r\n     be the duty of all citizens, whether \"good and law abiding\" or not,\r\n     to yield obedience to the Constitution, as will be seen by\r\n     referring to the proceedings in the Globe of that date, where the\r\n     following appears:\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. LOGAN.  I hope there will be no objection on this side of the\r\n     House to the introduction of the [Lovejoy] resolution.  I can see\r\n     no difference myself, between this resolution and the one\r\n     [Adrian's] just passed, except in regard to verbiage.  I can find\r\n     but one objection to the resolution, and that is in the use of the\r\n     words declaring that all' law abiding' citizens should obey the\r\n     Constitution.  I think that all men should do so.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. LOVEJOY.  I accept the amendment suggested by my Colleague.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. LOGAN.  It certainly should include members of Congress; but\r\n     if it is allowed to remain all 'good and law abiding' citizens, I\r\n     do not think it will include them.  [Laughter.]\r\n\r\n     \"The resolution was modified by the omission of those words.\"]\r\n\r\nIt also adopted, by 115 yeas to 44 nays, a resolution offered by Mr.\r\nMorris of Illinois, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved by the House of Representatives: That we properly estimate the\r\nimmense value of our National Union to our collective and individual\r\nhappiness; that we cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment\r\nto it; that we will speak of it as the palladium of our political safety\r\nand prosperity; that we will watch its preservation with jealous\r\nanxiety; that we will discountenance whatever may suggest even a\r\nsuspicion that it can, in any event, be abandoned, and indignantly frown\r\nupon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our\r\nCountry from the rest, or enfeeble the sacred ties which now link\r\ntogether the various parts; that we regard it as a main pillar in the\r\nedifice of our real independence, the support of tranquillity at home,\r\nour peace abroad, our safety, our prosperity, and that very liberty\r\nwhich we so highly prize; that we have seen nothing in the past, nor do\r\nwe see anything in the present, either in the election of Abraham\r\nLincoln to the Presidency of the United States, or from any other\r\nexisting cause, to justify its dissolution; that we regard its\r\nperpetuity as of more value than the temporary triumph of any Party or\r\nany man; that whatever evils or abuses exist under it ought to be\r\ncorrected within the Union, in a peaceful and Constitutional way; that\r\nwe believe it has sufficient power to redress every wrong and enforce\r\nevery right growing out of its organization, or pertaining to its proper\r\nfunctions; and that it is a patriotic duty to stand by it as our hope in\r\nPeace and our defense in War.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                           SECESSION ARMING.\r\n\r\nWhile Congress was encouraging devotion to the Union, and its Committees\r\nstriving for some mode by which the impending perils might be averted\r\nwithout a wholesale surrender of all just principles, the South Carolina\r\nConvention met (December 17, 1860) at Columbia, and after listening to\r\ninflammatory addresses by commissioners from the States of Alabama and\r\nMississippi, urging immediate and unconditional Secession, unanimously\r\nand with \"tremendous cheering\" adopted a resolution: \"That it is the\r\nopinion of the Convention that the State of South Carolina should\r\nforthwith Secede from the Federal Union, known as the United States of\r\nAmerica,\"--and then adjourned to meet at Charleston, South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe next day, and following days, it met there, at \"Secession Hall,\"\r\nlistening to stimulating addresses, while a committee of seven worked\r\nupon the Ordinance of Secession.  Among the statements made by orators,\r\nwere several clear admissions that the rebellious Conspiracy had existed\r\nfor very many years, and that Mr. Lincoln's election was simply the\r\nlong-sought-for pretext for Rebellion.  Mr. Parker said: \"It is no\r\nspasmodic effort that has come suddenly upon us; it has been gradually\r\nculminating for a long period of thirty years.  At last it has come to\r\nthat point where we may say, the matter is entirely right.\"  Mr. Inglis\r\nsaid: \"Most of us have had this matter under consideration for the last\r\ntwenty years; and I presume that we have by this time arrived at a\r\ndecision upon the subject.\"  Mr. Keitt said: \"I have been engaged in\r\nthis movement ever since I entered political life; * * *  we have\r\ncarried the body of this Union to its last resting place, and now we\r\nwill drop the flag over its grave.\"  Mr. Barnwell Rhett said: \"The\r\nSecession of South Carolina is not an event of a day.  It is not\r\nanything produced by Mr. Lincoln's election, or by the non-execution of\r\nthe Fugitive Slave Law.  It has been a matter which has been gathering\r\nhead for thirty years.\"  Mr. Gregg said: \"If we undertake to set forth\r\nall the causes, do we not dishonor the memory of all the statesmen of\r\nSouth Carolina, now departed, who commenced forty years ago a war\r\nagainst the tariff and against internal improvement, saying nothing of\r\nthe United States Bank, and other measures which may now be regarded as\r\nobsolete.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of December, 1860--the fourth day of the sittings--the\r\nOrdinance of Secession was reported by the Committee, and was at once\r\nunanimously passed, as also was a resolution that \"the passage of the\r\nOrdinance be proclaimed by the firing of artillery and ringing of the\r\nbells of the city, and such other demonstrations as the people may deem\r\nappropriate on the passage of the great Act of Deliverance and Liberty;\"\r\nafter which the Convention jubilantly adjourned to meet, and ratify,\r\nthat evening.  At the evening session of this memorable Convention, the\r\nGovernor and Legislature attending, the famous Ordinance was read as\r\nengrossed, signed by all the delegates, and, after announcement by the\r\nPresident that \"the State of South Carolina is now and henceforth a Free\r\nand Independent Commonwealth;\" amid tremendous cheering, the Convention\r\nadjourned.  This, the first Ordinance of Secession passed by any of the\r\nRevolting States, was in these words:\r\n\r\n\"An Ordinance to dissolve the Union between the State of South Carolina\r\nand other States united with her, under the compact entitled the\r\n'Constitution of the United States of America.'\r\n\r\n\"We the people of the State of South Carolina in Convention assembled,\r\ndo declare and ordain, and it is hereby declared and ordained, that the\r\nOrdinance adopted by us in Convention on the 23rd day of May, in the\r\nyear of our Lord 1788, whereby the Constitution of the United States of\r\nAmerica was ratified, and also all Acts and parts of Acts of the General\r\nAssembly of this State ratifying the amendments of the said\r\nConstitution, are hereby repealed; and that the Union now subsisting\r\nbetween South Carolina and other States, under the name of the United\r\nStates of America, is hereby dissolved.\"\r\n\r\nThus, and in these words, was joyously adopted and ratified, that solemn\r\nAct of Separation which was doomed to draw in its fateful train so many\r\nother Southern States, in the end only to be blotted out with the blood\r\nof hundreds of thousands of their own brave sons, and their equally\r\ncourageous Northern brothers.\r\n\r\nState after State followed South Carolina in the mad course of Secession\r\nfrom the Union.  Mississippi passed a Secession Ordinance, January 9,\r\n1861.  Florida followed, January 10th; Alabama, January 11th; Georgia,\r\nJanuary 18th; Louisiana, January 26th; and Texas, February 1st;\r\nArkansas, North Carolina, and Virginia held back until a later period;\r\nwhile Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Maryland, and Delaware, abstained\r\naltogether from taking the fatal step, despite all attempts to bring\r\nthem to it.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, South Carolina had put on all the dignity of\r\na Sovereign and Independent State.  Her Governor had a \"cabinet\"\r\ncomprising Secretaries of State, War, Treasury, the Interior, and a\r\nPostmaster General. She had appointed Commissioners, to proceed to the\r\nother Slave-holding States, through whom a Southern Congress was\r\nproposed, to meet at Montgomery, Alabama; and had appointed seven\r\ndelegates to meet the delegates from such other States in that proposed\r\nSouthern Congress.  On the 21st of December, 1860, three Commissioners\r\n(Messrs.  Barnwell, Adams, and Orr) were also appointed to proceed to\r\nWashington, and treat for the cession by the United States to South\r\nCarolina, of all Federal property within the limits of the latter.  On\r\nthe 24th, Governor Pickens issued a Proclamation announcing the adoption\r\nof the Ordinance of Secession, declaring \"that the State of South\r\nCarolina is, as she has a right to be, a separate sovereign, free and\r\nindependent State, and as such, has a right to levy war, conclude peace,\r\nnegotiate treaties, leagues or covenants, and to do all acts whatsoever\r\nthat rightfully appertain to a free and independent State;\" the which\r\nproclamation was announced as \"Done in the eighty-fifth year of the\r\nSovereignty and Independence of South Carolina.\"  On the same day (the\r\nSenators from that State in the United States Senate having long since,\r\nas we have seen, withdrawn from that body) the Representatives of South\r\nCarolina in the United States House of Representatives withdrew.\r\n\r\nSerious dissensions in the Cabinet of President Buchanan, were now\r\nrapidly disintegrating the \"official family\" of the President.  Lewis\r\nCass, the Secretary of State, disgusted with the President's cowardice\r\nand weakness, and declining to be held responsible for Mr. Buchanan's\r\npromise not to reinforce the garrisons of the National Forts, under\r\nMajor Anderson, in Charleston harbor, retired from the Cabinet December\r\n12th--Howell Cobb having already, \"because his duty to Georgia required\r\nit,\" resigned the Secretaryship of the Treasury, and left it bankrupt\r\nand the credit of the Nation almost utterly destroyed.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of December, Major Anderson evacuated Fort Moultrie,\r\nremoving all his troops and munitions of war to Fort Sumter--whereupon a\r\ncry went up from Charleston that this was in violation of the\r\nPresident's promise to take no step looking to hostilities, provided the\r\nSecessionists committed no overt act of Rebellion, up to the close of\r\nhis fast expiring Administration.  On the 29th, John B. Floyd, Secretary\r\nof War, having failed to secure the consent of the Administration to an\r\nentire withdrawal of the Federal garrison from the harbor of Charleston,\r\nalso resigned, and the next day--he having in the meantime escaped in\r\nsafety to Virginia--was indicted by the Grand Jury at Washington, for\r\nmalfeasance and conspiracy to defraud the Government in the theft of\r\n$870,000 of Indian Trust Bonds from the Interior Department, and the\r\nsubstitution therefor of Floyd's acceptances of worthless\r\narmy-transportation drafts on the Treasury Department.\r\n\r\nJacob Thompson, Secretary of the Interior, also resigned, January 8th,\r\n1861, on the pretext that \"additional troops, he had heard, have been\r\nordered to Charleston\" in the \"Star of the West.\"--[McPherson's History\r\nof the Rebellion, p. 28.]\r\n\r\nSeveral changes were thus necessitated in Mr. Buchanan's cabinet, by\r\nthese and other resignations, so that by the 18th of January, 1861,\r\nJeremiah S. Black was Secretary of State; General John A. Dix, Secretary\r\nof the Treasury; Joseph Holt, Secretary of War; Edwin M. Stanton,\r\nAttorney General; and Horatio King, Postmaster General.  But before\r\nleaving the Cabinet, the conspiring Southern members of it, and their\r\nfriends, had managed to hamstring the National Government, by scattering\r\nthe Navy in other quarters of the World; by sending the few troops of\r\nthe United States to remote points; by robbing the arsenals in the\r\nNorthern States of arms and munitions of war, so as to abundantly supply\r\nthe Southern States at the critical moment; by bankrupting the Treasury\r\nand shattering the public credit of the Nation; and by other means no\r\nless nefarious.  Thus swindled, betrayed, and ruined, by its degenerate\r\nand perfidious sons, the imbecile Administration stood with dejected\r\nmien and folded hands helplessly awaiting the coming catastrophe.\r\n\r\nOn December 28th, 1860, the three Commissioners of South Carolina having\r\nreached Washington, addressed to the President a communication, in\r\nwhich--after reciting their powers and duties, under the Ordinance of\r\nSecession, and stating that they had hoped to have been ready to proceed\r\nto negotiate amicably and without \"hostile collision,\" but that \"the\r\nevents--[The removal, to Fort Sumter, of Major Anderson's command, and\r\nwhat followed.]--of the last twenty-four hours render such an assurance\r\nimpossible\"--they declared that the troops must be withdrawn from\r\nCharleston harbor, as \"they are a standing menace which render\r\nnegotiation impossible,\" threatening speedily to bring the questions\r\ninvolved, to \"a bloody issue.\"\r\n\r\nTo this communication Mr. Buchanan replied at considerable length,\r\nDecember 30th, in an apologetic, self-defensive strain, declaring that\r\nthe removal by Major Anderson of the Federal troops under his command,\r\nfrom Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter was done \"upon his own responsibility,\r\nand without authority,\" and that he (the President) \"had intended to\r\ncommand him to return to his former position,\" but that events had so\r\nrapidly transpired as to preclude the giving of any such command;\r\n\r\n     [The seizure by the Secessionists, under the Palmetto Flag, of\r\n     Castle Pinckney and Fort Moultrie; the simultaneous raising of that\r\n     flag over the Federal Custom House and Post Office at Charleston;\r\n     the resignation of the Federal Collector, Naval Officer and\r\n     Surveyor of that Port--all of which occurred December 27th; and the\r\n     seizure \"by force of arms,\" December 30th, of the United States\r\n     Arsenal at that point.]\r\n\r\nand concluding, with a very slight stiffening of backbone, by saying:\r\n\"After this information, I have only to add that, whilst it is my duty\r\nto defend Fort Sumter as a portion of the public property of the United\r\nStates against hostile attacks, from whatever quarter they may come, by\r\nsuch means as I may possess for this purpose, I do not perceive how such\r\na defense can be construed into a menace against the city of\r\nCharleston.\"  To this reply of the President, the Commissioners made\r\nrejoinder on the 1st of January, 1861; but the President \"declined to\r\nreceive\" the communication.\r\n\r\nFrom this time on, until the end of President Buchanan's term of office,\r\nand the inauguration of Mr. Lincoln as President, March 4th, 1861,\r\nevents crowded each other so hurriedly, that the flames of Rebellion in\r\nthe South were continually fanned, while the public mind in the North\r\nwas staggered and bewildered, by them.\r\n\r\nOn January 2nd, prior to the Secession of Georgia, Forts Pulaski and\r\nJackson, commanding Savannah, and the Federal Arsenal at Augusta,\r\nGeorgia, with two 12 pound howitzers, two cannon, 22,000 muskets and\r\nrifles, and ammunition in quantity, were seized by Rebel militia.  About\r\nthe same date, although North Carolina had not seceded, her Governor\r\n(Ellis) seized the Federal Arsenal at Fayetteville, Fort Macon, and\r\nother fortifications in that State, \"to preserve them\" from mob-seizure.\r\n\r\nJanuary 4th, anticipating Secession, Alabama State troops seized Fort\r\nMorgan, with 5,000 shot and shell, and Mount Vernon Arsenal at Mobile,\r\nwith 2,000 stand of arms, 150, 000 pounds of powder, some pieces of\r\ncannon, and a large quantity of other munitions of war.  The United\r\nStates Revenue cutter, \"Lewis Cass,\" was also surrendered to Alabama.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th, the Federal steamer \"Star of the West,\" with reinforcements\r\nand supplies for Fort Sumter, left New York in the night--and Secretary\r\nJacob Thompson notified the South Carolina Rebels of the fact.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th, the \"Star of the West\" appeared off Charleston bar, and\r\nwhile steaming toward Fort Sumter, was fired upon by Rebel batteries at\r\nFort Moultrie and Morris Island, and struck by a shot, whereupon she\r\nreturned to New York without accomplishing her mission.  That day the\r\nState of Mississippi seceded from the Union.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th, the Federal storeship \"Texas,\" with Federal guns and\r\nstores, was seized by Texans.  On the same day Florida seceded.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th, Forts Jackson and St. Philip, commanding the mouth of the\r\nMississippi River, and Fort Pike, dominating Lake Pontchartrain, were\r\nseized by Louisiana troops; also the Federal Arsenal at Baton Rouge,\r\nwith 50,000 small arms, 4 howitzers, 20 heavy pieces of ordnance, 2\r\nbatteries, 300 barrels of powder, and other stores.  The State of\r\nAlabama also seceded the same day.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th--Fort Marion, the coast surveying schooner \"Dana,\" the\r\nArsenal at St. Augustine, and that on the Chattahoochee, with 500,000\r\nmusket cartridges, 300,000 rifle cartridges and 50,000 pounds of powder,\r\nhaving previously been seized--Forts Barrancas and McRae, and the Navy\r\nYard at Pensacola, were taken by Rebel troops of Florida, Alabama and\r\nMississippi.  On the same day, Colonel Hayne, of South Carolina, arrived\r\nat Washington as Agent or Commissioner to the National Government from\r\nGovernor Pickens of that State.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th, the South Carolina Legislature resolved \"that any attempt\r\nby the Federal Government to reinforce Fort Sumter will be regarded as\r\nan act of open hostility, and a Declaration of War.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 16th, Colonel Hayne, of South Carolina, developed his mission,\r\nwhich was to demand of the President the surrender of Fort Sumter to the\r\nSouth Carolina authorities--a demand that had already been made upon,\r\nand refused by, Major Anderson.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence concerning this demand, between Colonel Hayne and ten\r\nSouthern United States Senators;--[Senators Wigfall, Hemphill, Yulee,\r\nMallory, Jeff.  Davis, C. C. Clay, Fitzgerald, Iverson, Slidell, and\r\nBenjamin.]--the reply of the President, by Secretary Holt, to those\r\nSenators; Governor Pickens's review of the same; and the final demand;\r\nconsumed the balance of the month of January; and ended, February 6th,\r\nin a further reply, through the Secretary of War, from the President,\r\nasserting the title of the United States to that Fort, and declining the\r\ndemand, as \"he has no Constitutional power to cede or surrender it.\"\r\nSecretary Holt's letter concluded by saying: \"If, with all the\r\nmultiplied proofs which exist of the President's anxiety for Peace, and\r\nof the earnestness with which he has pursued it, the authorities of that\r\nState shall assault Fort Sumter, and peril the lives of the handful of\r\nbrave and loyal men shut up within its walls, and thus plunge our Common\r\nCountry into the horrors of Civil War, then upon them and those they\r\nrepresent, must rest the responsibility.\"\r\n\r\nBut to return from this momentary diversion: On the 18th of January,\r\nGeorgia seceded; and on the 20th, the Federal Fort at Ship Island,\r\nMississippi, and the United States Hospital on the Mississippi River\r\nwere seized by Mississippi troops.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th, Louisiana seceded.  On the 28th, Louisiana troops seized\r\nall the quartermaster's and commissary stores held by Federal officials;\r\nand the United States Revenue cutter \"McClelland\" surrendered to the\r\nRebels.\r\n\r\nOn February 1st, the Louisiana Rebels seized the National Mint and\r\nCustom House at New Orleans, with $599,303 in gold and silver.  On the\r\nsame day the State of Texas seceded.\r\n\r\nOn February 8th, the National Arsenal at Little Rock, Arkansas, with\r\n9,000 small arms, 40 cannon, and quantities of ammunition, was seized;\r\nand the same day the Governor of Georgia ordered the National Collector\r\nof the Port of Savannah to retain all collections and make no further\r\npayments to the United States Government.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     [It was during this eventful month that, certain United States\r\n     troops having assembled at the National Capital, and the House of\r\n     Representatives having asked the reason therefor, reply was made by\r\n     the Secretary of War as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"WAR DEPARTMENT, February 18, 1861.\r\n          [Congressional Globe, August 8, 1861, pp.  457,458]\r\n     \"SIR: On the 11th February, the House of Representatives adopted a\r\n     resolution requesting the President, if not incompatible with the\r\n     public interests, to communicate 'the reasons that had induced him\r\n     to assemble so large a number of troops in this city, and why they\r\n     are kept here; and whether he has any information of a Conspiracy\r\n     upon the part of any portion of the citizens of this Country to\r\n     seize upon the Capital and prevent the Inauguration of the\r\n     President elect.'\r\n\r\n     \"This resolution having been submitted to this Department for\r\n     consideration and report, I have the honor to state, that the body\r\n     of troops temporarily transferred to this city is not as large as\r\n     is assumed by the resolution, though it is a well-appointed corps\r\n     and admirably adapted for the preservation of the public peace.\r\n     The reasons which led to their being assembled here will now be\r\n     briefly stated.\r\n\r\n     \"I shall make no comment upon the origin of the Revolution which,\r\n     for the last three months, has been in progress in several of the\r\n     Southern States, nor shall I enumerate the causes which have\r\n     hastened its advancement or exasperated its temper.  The scope of\r\n     the questions submitted by the House will be sufficiently met by\r\n     dealing with the facts as they exist, irrespective of the cause\r\n     from which they have proceeded.  That Revolution has been\r\n     distinguished by a boldness and completeness of success rarely\r\n     equaled in the history of Civil Commotions.  Its overthrow of the\r\n     Federal authority has not only been sudden and wide-spread, but has\r\n     been marked by excesses which have alarmed all and been sources of\r\n     profound humiliation to a large portion of the American People.\r\n     Its history is a history of surprises and treacheries and ruthless\r\n     spoliations.  The Forts of the United States have been captured and\r\n     garrisoned, and hostile flags unfurled upon their ramparts.  Its\r\n     arsenals have been seized, and the vast amount of public arms they\r\n     contained appropriated to the use of the captors; while more than\r\n     half a million dollars, found in the Mint at New Orleans, has been\r\n     unscrupulously applied to replenish the coffers of Louisiana.\r\n     Officers in command of revenue cutters of the United States have\r\n     been prevailed on to violate their trusts and surrender the\r\n     property in their charge; and instead of being branded for their\r\n     crimes, they, and the vessels they betrayed, have been cordially\r\n     received into the service of the Seceded States.  These movements\r\n     were attended by yet more discouraging indications of immorality.\r\n     It was generally believed that this Revolution was guided and urged\r\n     on by men occupying the highest positions in the public service,\r\n     and who, with the responsibilities of an oath to support the\r\n     Constitution still resting upon their consciences, did not hesitate\r\n     secretly to plan and openly to labor for, the dismemberment of the\r\n     Republic whose honors they enjoyed and upon whose Treasury they\r\n     were living.  As examples of evil are always more potent than those\r\n     of good, this spectacle of demoralization on the part of States and\r\n     statesmen could not fail to produce the most deplorable\r\n     consequences.  The discontented and the disloyal everywhere took\r\n     courage.  In other States, adjacent to and supposed to sympathize\r\n     in sense of political wrong with those referred to, Revolutionary\r\n     schemes were set on foot, and Forts and arms of the United States\r\n     seized.  The unchecked prevalence of the Revolution, and the\r\n     intoxication which its triumphs inspired, naturally suggested\r\n     wilder and yet more desperate enterprises than the conquest of\r\n     ungarrisoned Forts, or the plunder of an unguarded Mint.  At what\r\n     time the armed occupation of Washington City became a part of the\r\n     Revolutionary Programme, is not certainly known.  More than six\r\n     weeks ago, the impression had already extensively obtained that a\r\n     Conspiracy for the accomplishment of this guilty purpose was in\r\n     process of formation, if not fully matured.  The earnest endeavors\r\n     made by men known to be devoted to the Revolution, to hurry\r\n     Virginia and Maryland out of the Union, were regarded as\r\n     preparatory steps for the subjugation of Washington.  This plan was\r\n     in entire harmony with the aim and spirit of those seeking the\r\n     subversion of the Government, since no more fatal blow at its\r\n     existence could be struck than the permanent and hostile possession\r\n     of the seat of its power.  It was in harmony, too, with the avowed\r\n     designs of the Revolutionists, which looked to the formation of a\r\n     Confederacy of all the Slave States, and necessarily to the\r\n     Conquest of the Capital within their limits.  It seemed not very\r\n     indistinctly prefigured in a Proclamation made upon the floor of\r\n     the Senate, without qualification, if not exultingly, that the\r\n     Union was already dissolved--a Proclamation which, however\r\n     intended, was certainly calculated to invite, on the part of men of\r\n     desperate fortunes or of Revolutionary States, a raid upon the\r\n     Capital.  In view of the violence and turbulent disorders already\r\n     exhibited in the South, the public mind could not reject such a\r\n     scheme as at all improbable.  That a belief in its existence was\r\n     entertained by multitudes, there can be no doubt, and this belief I\r\n     fully shared.  My conviction rested not only on the facts already\r\n     alluded to, but upon information, some of which was of a most\r\n     conclusive character, that reached the Government from many parts\r\n     of the Country, not merely expressing the prevalence of the opinion\r\n     that such an organization had been formed, but also often\r\n     furnishing the plausible grounds on which the opinion was based.\r\n     Superadded to these proofs, were the oft-repeated declarations of\r\n     men in high political positions here, and who were known to have\r\n     intimate affiliations with the Revolution--if indeed they did not\r\n     hold its reins in their hands--to the effect that Mr. Lincoln would\r\n     not, or should not be inaugurated at Washington.  Such\r\n     declarations, from such men, could not be treated as empty bluster.\r\n     They were the solemn utterances of those who well understood the\r\n     import of their words, and who, in the exultation of the temporary\r\n     victories gained over their Country's flag in the South, felt\r\n     assured that events would soon give them the power to verify their\r\n     predictions.  Simultaneously with these prophetic warnings, a\r\n     Southern journal of large circulation and influence, and which is\r\n     published near the city of Washington, advocated its seizure as a\r\n     possible political necessity.\r\n\r\n     \"The nature and power of the testimony thus accumulated may be best\r\n     estimated by the effect produced upon the popular mind.\r\n     Apprehensions for the safety of the Capital were communicated from\r\n     points near and remote, by men unquestionably reliable and loyal.\r\n     The resident population became disquieted, and the repose of many\r\n     families in the city was known to be disturbed by painful\r\n     anxieties.  Members of Congress, too-men of calm and comprehensive\r\n     views, and of undoubted fidelity to their Country--frankly\r\n     expressed their solicitude to the President and to this Department,\r\n     and formally insisted that the defenses of the Capital should be\r\n     strengthened.  With such warnings, it could not be forgotten that,\r\n     had the late Secretary of War heeded the anonymous letter which he\r\n     received, the tragedy at Harper's Ferry would have been avoided;\r\n     nor could I fail to remember that, had the early admonitions which\r\n     reached here in regard to the designs of lawless men upon the Forts\r\n     of Charleston Harbor been acted on by sending forward adequate\r\n     reinforcements before the Revolution began, the disastrous\r\n     political complications that ensued might not have occurred.\r\n\r\n     \"Impressed by these circumstances and considerations, I earnestly\r\n     besought you to allow the concentration, at this city, of a\r\n     sufficient military force to preserve the public peace from all the\r\n     dangers that seemed to threaten it.  An open manifestation, on the\r\n     part of the Administration, of a determination, as well as of the\r\n     ability, to maintain the laws, would, I was convinced, prove the\r\n     surest, as also the most pacific, means of baffling and dissolving\r\n     any Conspiracy that might have been organized.  It was believed too\r\n     that the highest and most solemn responsibility resting upon a\r\n     President withdrawing from the Government, was to secure to his\r\n     successor a peaceful Inauguration.  So deeply, in my judgment, did\r\n     this duty concern the whole Country and the fair fame of our\r\n     Institutions, that, to guarantee its faithful discharge, I was\r\n     persuaded no preparation could be too determined or too complete.\r\n     The presence of the troops alluded to in the resolution is the\r\n     result of the conclusion arrived at by yourself and Cabinet, on the\r\n     proposition submitted to you by this Department.  Already this\r\n     display of life and loyalty on the part of your Administration, has\r\n     produced the happiest effects.  Public confidence has been\r\n     restored, and the feverish apprehension which it was so mortifying\r\n     to contemplate has been banished.  Whatever may have been the\r\n     machinations of deluded, lawless men, the execution of their\r\n     purpose has been suspended, if not altogether abandoned in view of\r\n     preparations which announce more impressively than words that this\r\n     Administration is alike able and resolved to transfer in peace, to\r\n     the President elect, the authority that, under the Constitution,\r\n     belongs to him.  To those, if such there be, who desire the\r\n     destruction of the Republic, the presence of these troops is\r\n     necessarily offensive; but those who sincerely love our\r\n     Institutions cannot fail to rejoice that, by this timely precaution\r\n     they have possibly escaped the deep dishonor which they must have\r\n     suffered had the Capital, like the Forts and Arsenals of the South,\r\n     fallen into the hands of the Revolutionists, who have found this\r\n     great Government weak only because, in the exhaustless beneficence\r\n     of its spirit, it has refused to strike, even in its own defense,\r\n     lest it should wound the aggressor.\r\n\r\n     \"I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                              \"J. HOLT.\r\n                         \"Secretary of War,\r\n\r\n     \"THE PRESIDENT.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn February 20th, Forts Chadbourne and Belknap were seized by the Texan\r\nRebels; and on the 22nd, the Federal General Twiggs basely surrendered\r\nto them all the fortifications under his control, his little Army, and\r\nall the Government stores in his possession--comprising $55,000 in\r\nspecie, 35,000 stand of arms, 26 pieces of mounted artillery, 44\r\ndismounted guns, and ammunition, horses, wagons, forage, etc., valued at\r\nnearly $2,000,000.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of March, the Texan Rebels seized the United States Revenue\r\ncutter \"Dodge\" at Galveston; and on the 6th, Fort Brown was surrendered\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nThus, with surrender after surrender, and seizure after\r\nseizure, of its revenue vessels and fortifications and troops and arms\r\nand munitions of war in the Southern States--with Fort Sumter invested\r\nand at the mercy of any attack, and Fortress Monroe alone of all the\r\nNational strongholds yet safe--with State after State seceding--what\r\nwonder that, while these events gave all encouragement to the Southern\r\nRebels, the Patriots of the North stood aghast at the appalling\r\nspectacle of a crumbling and dissolving Union!\r\n\r\nDuring this period of National peril, the debates in both branches of\r\nCongress upon propositions for adjustment of the unfortunate differences\r\nbetween the Southern Seceders and the Union, as has been already hinted,\r\ncontributed still further to agitate the public mind.  Speech after\r\nspeech by the ablest and most brilliant Americans in public life, for or\r\nagainst such propositions, and discussing the rightfulness or\r\nwrongfulness of Secession, were made in Congress day after day, and, by\r\nmeans of the telegraph and the press, alternately swayed the Northern\r\nheart with feelings of hope, chagrin, elation or despair.\r\n\r\nThe Great Debate was opened in the Senate on almost the very first day\r\nof its session (December 4th, 1860), by Mr. Clingman, of North Carolina,\r\nwho, referring to South Carolina, declared that \"Instead of being\r\nprecipitate, she and the whole South have been wonderfully patient.\"  A\r\nportion of that speech is interesting even at this time, as showing how\r\ncertain phases of the Tariff and Internal Improvement questions entered\r\ninto the consideration of some of the Southern Secession leaders.  Said\r\nhe, \"I know there are intimations that suffering will fall upon us of\r\nthe South, if we secede.  My people are not terrified by any such\r\nconsiderations.  * * *  They have no fears of the future if driven to\r\nrely on themselves.  The Southern States have more territory than all\r\nthe Colonies had when they Seceded from Great Britain, and a better\r\nterritory.  Taking its position, climate, and fertility into\r\nconsideration, there is not upon Earth a body of territory superior to\r\nit.  * * *  The Southern States have, too, at this day, four times the\r\npopulation the Colonies had when they Seceded from Great Britain.  Their\r\nexports to the North and to Foreign Countries were, last year, more than\r\n$300,000,000; and a duty of ten per cent. upon the same amount of\r\nimports would give $30,000,000 of revenue--twice as much as General\r\nJackson's administration spent in its first year.  Everybody can see,\r\ntoo, how the bringing in of $300,000,000 of imports into Southern ports\r\nwould enliven business in our seaboard towns.  I have seen with some\r\nsatisfaction, also, Mr. President, that the war made upon us has\r\nbenefitted certain branches of industry in my State.  There are\r\nmanufacturing establishments in North Carolina, the proprietors of which\r\ntell me that they are making fifty per cent. annually on their whole\r\ncapital, and yet cannot supply one tenth of the demand for their\r\nproduction.  The result of only ten per cent. duties in excluding\r\nproducts from abroad, would give life and impetus to mechanical and\r\nmanufacturing industry, throughout the entire South.  Our people\r\nunderstand these things, and they are not afraid of results, if forced\r\nto declare Independence.  Indeed I do not see why Northern Republicans\r\nshould wish to continue a connection with us upon any terms.  * * *\r\nThey want High Tariff likewise.  They may put on five hundred per cent.\r\nif they choose, upon their own imports, and nobody on our side will\r\ncomplain.  They may spend all the money they raise on railroads, or\r\nopening harbors, or anything on earth they desire, without interference\r\nfrom us; and it does seem to me that if they are sincere in their views\r\nthey ought to welcome a separation.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the very commencement of this long three-months debate, it was the\r\npolicy of the Southern leaders to make it appear that the Southern\r\nStates were in an attitude of injured innocence and defensiveness\r\nagainst Northern aggression.  Hence, it was that, as early as December\r\n5th, on the floor of the Senate, through Mr. Brown, of Mississippi, they\r\ndeclared: \"All we ask is to be allowed to depart in Peace.  Submit we\r\nwill not; and if, because we will not submit to your domination, you\r\nchoose to make War upon us, let God defend the Right!\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time it was esteemed necessary to try and frighten the North\r\ninto acquiescence with this demand to be \"let alone.\"  Hence such\r\nutterances as those of Clingman and Iverson, to which reference has\r\nalready been made, and the especially defiant close of the latter's\r\nspeech, when--replying to the temperate but firm Union utterances of Mr.\r\nHale--the Georgia Senator said: \"Sir, I do not believe there will be any\r\nWar; but if War is to come, let it come; we will meet the Senator from\r\nNew Hampshire and all the myrmidons of Abolitionism and Black\r\nRepublicanism everywhere upon our own soil; and, in the language of a\r\ndistinguished member from Ohio in relation to the Mexican War, we will\r\n'welcome you with bloody hands to hospitable graves.'\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in order to encourage the revolting States to the\r\nspeedy commission of overt acts of Rebellion and violence, that would\r\nprecipitate War without a peradventure, utterances fell from Southern\r\nlips, in the National Senate Chamber, like those of Mr. Wigfall, when he\r\nsaid, during this first day of the debate: \"Frederick the Great, on one\r\noccasion, when he had trumped up an old title to some of the adjacent\r\nterritory, quietly put himself in possession and then offered to treat.\r\nWere I a South Carolinian, as I am a Texan, and I knew that my State was\r\ngoing out of the Union, and that this Government would attempt to use\r\nforce, I would, at the first moment that that fact became manifest,\r\nseize upon the Forts and the arms and the munitions of war, and raise\r\nthe cry 'To your tents, O Israel, and to the God of battles be this\r\nissue!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as we have already seen, the Rebels of the South were not slow in\r\nfollowing the baleful advice to the letter.  But it was not many days\r\nafter this utterance when the Conspirators against the Union evidently\r\nbegan to fear that the ground for Rebellion, upon which they had planted\r\nthemselves, would be taken from under their feet by the impulse of\r\nCompromise and Concession which stirred so strongly the fraternal spirit\r\nof the North.  That peaceful impulse must be checked and exasperated by\r\nsneers and impossible demands.  Hence, on December 12th we find one of\r\nthe most active and favorite mouthpieces of Treason, Mr. Wigfall,\r\nputting forth such demands, in his most offensive manner.\r\n\r\nSaid he: \"If the two Senators from New York (Seward and King), the\r\nSenator from Ohio (Wade), the two Senators from Illinois (Douglas and\r\nTrumbull), the Senator from New Hampshire (Hale), the Senator from\r\nMaine, and others who are regarded as representative men, who have\r\ndenied that by the Constitution of the United States, Slaves are\r\nrecognized as Property; who have urged and advocated those acts which we\r\nregard as aggressive on the part of the People--if they will rise here,\r\nand say in their places, that they desire to propose amendments to the\r\nConstitution, and beg that we will vote for them; that they will, in\r\ngood faith, go to their respective constituencies and urge the\r\nratification; that they believe, if these Gulf States will suspend their\r\naction, that those amendments will be ratified and carried out in good\r\nfaith; that they will cease preaching this 'irrepressible conflict'; and\r\nif, in those amendments, it is declared that Slaves are Property, that\r\nthey shall be delivered up upon demand; and that they will assure us\r\nthat Abolition societies shall be abolished; that Abolition speeches\r\nshall no longer be made; that we shall have peace and quiet; that we\r\nshall not be called cut-throats and pirates and murderers; that our\r\nwomen shall not be slandered--these things being said in good faith, the\r\nSenators begging that we will stay our hand until an honest effort can\r\nbe made, I believe that there is a prospect of giving them a fair\r\nconsideration!\"\r\n\r\nSmall wonder is it, that this labored and ridiculous piece of\r\nimpertinence was received with ironical laughter on the Republican side\r\nof the Senate Chamber.  And it was in reference to these threats, and\r\nthese preposterous demands--including the suppression of the right of\r\nFree Discussion and Liberty of the Press--that, in the same chamber\r\n(January 7, 1861) the gallant and eloquent Baker said:\r\n\r\n\"Your Fathers had fought for that right, and more than that, they had\r\ndeclared that the violation of that right was one of the great causes\r\nwhich impelled them to the Separation.  * * *  Sir, the Liberty of the\r\nPress is the highest safeguard to all Free Government.  Ours could not\r\nexist without it.  It is with us, nay, with all men, like a great\r\nexulting and abounding river, It is fed by the dews of Heaven, which\r\ndistil their sweetest drops to form it.  It gushes from the rill, as it\r\nbreaks from the deep caverns of the Earth.  It is fed by a thousand\r\naffluents, that dash from the mountaintop to separate again into a\r\nthousand bounteous and irrigating rills around.  On its broad bosom it\r\nbears a thousand barks.  There, Genius spreads its purpling sail.\r\nThere, Poetry dips its silver oar.  There, Art, Invention, Discovery,\r\nScience, Morality, Religion, may safely and securely float.  It wanders\r\nthrough every land.  It is a genial, cordial source of thought and\r\ninspiration, wherever it touches, whatever it surrounds.  Sir, upon its\r\nborders, there grows every flower of Grace and every fruit of Truth.  I\r\nam not here to deny that that Stream sometimes becomes a dangerous\r\nTorrent, and destroys towns and cities upon its bank; but I am here to\r\nsay that without it, Civilization, Humanity, Government, all that makes\r\nSociety itself, would disappear, and the World would return to its\r\nancient Barbarism.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, if that were to be possible, or so thought for a moment, the fine\r\nconception of the great Poet would be realized.  If that were to be\r\npossible, though but for a moment, Civilization itself would roll the\r\nwheels of its car backward for two thousand years.  Sir, if that were\r\nso, it would be true that:\r\n\r\n          'As one by one in dread Medea's train,\r\n          Star after Star fades off th' ethereal plain,\r\n          Thus at her fell approach and secret might,\r\n          Art after art goes out, and all is night.\r\n          Philosophy, that leaned on Heaven before,\r\n          Sinks to her second cause, and is no more.\r\n          Religion, blushing, veils her sacred fires,\r\n          And, unawares, Morality expires.'\r\n\r\n\"Sir, we will not risk these consequences, even for Slavery; we will not\r\nrisk these consequences even for Union; we will not risk these\r\nconsequences to avoid that Civil War with which you threaten us; that\r\nWar which, you announce so deadly, and which you declare to be\r\ninevitable.  * * *  I will never yield to the idea that the great\r\nGovernment of this Country shall protect Slavery in any Territory now\r\nours, or hereafter to be acquired.  It is, in my opinion, a great\r\nprinciple of Free Government, not, to be surrendered.\r\n\r\n\"It is in my judgment, the object of the great battle which we have\r\nfought, and which we have won.  It is, in my poor opinion, the point\r\nupon which there is concord and agreement between the great masses of\r\nthe North, who may agree in no other political opinion whatever.  Be he\r\nRepublican, or Democrat, or Douglas man, or Lincoln man; be he from the\r\nNorth, or the West, from Oregon, or from Maine, in my judgment\r\nnine-tenths of the entire population of the North and West are devoted,\r\nin the very depths of their hearts, to the great Constitutional idea\r\nthat Freedom is the rule, that Slavery is the exception, that it ought\r\nnot to be extended by virtue of the powers of the Government of the\r\nUnited States; and, come weal, come woe, it never shall be.\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, I add one other thing.  When you talk to me about Compromise\r\nor Concession, I am not sure that I always understand you.  Do you mean\r\nthat I am to give up my convictions of right?  Armies cannot compel that\r\nin the breast of a Free People.  Do you mean that I am to concede the\r\nbenefits of the political struggle through which we have passed,\r\nconsidered politically, only?  You are too just and too generous to ask\r\nthat.  Do you mean that we are to deny the great principle upon which\r\nour political action has been based?  You know we cannot.  But if you\r\nmean by Compromise and Concession to ask us to see whether we have not\r\nbeen hasty, angry, passionate, excited, and in many respects violated\r\nyour feelings, your character, your right of property, we will look;\r\nand, as I said yesterday, if we have, we will undo it.  Allow me to say\r\nagain, if there be any lawyer or any Court that will advise us that our\r\nlaws are unconstitutional, we will repeal them.\r\n\r\n\"Now as to territory.  I will not yield one inch to Secession; but there\r\nare things that I will yield, and there are things to which I will\r\nyield.  It is somewhere told that when Harold of England received a\r\nmessenger from a brother with whom he was at variance, to inquire on\r\nwhat terms reconciliation and peace could be effected between brothers,\r\nhe replied in a gallant and generous spirit in a few words, 'the, terms\r\nI offer are the affection of a brother; and the Earldom of\r\nNorthumberland.'  And, said the Envoy, as he marched up the Hall amid\r\nthe warriors that graced the state of the King, 'if Tosti, thy brother,\r\nagree to this, what terms will you allow to his ally and friend,\r\nHadrada, the giant.'  'We will allow,' said Harold, 'to Hadrada, the\r\ngiant, seven feet of English ground, and if he be, as they say, a giant,\r\nsome few inches more!' and, as he spake, the Hall rang with acclamation.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, in that spirit I speak.  I follow, at a humble distance, the ideas\r\nand the words of Clay, illustrious, to be venerated, and honored, and\r\nremembered, forever.  * * *  He said--I say: that I will yield no inch,\r\nno word, to the threat of Secession, unconstitutional, revolutionary,\r\ndangerous, unwise, at variance with the heart and the hope of all\r\nmankind save themselves.  To that I yield nothing; but if States loyal\r\nto the Constitution, if people magnanimous and just, desiring a return\r\nof fraternal feeling, shall come to us and ask for Peace, for permanent,\r\nenduring peace and affection, and say, 'What will you grant?  I say to\r\nthem, 'Ask all that a gentleman ought to propose, and I will yield all\r\nthat a gentleman ought to offer.'  Nay, more: if you are galled because\r\nwe claim the right to prohibit Slavery in territory now Free, or in any\r\nTerritory which acknowledges our jurisdiction, we will evade--I speak\r\nbut for myself--I will aid in evading that question; I will agree to\r\nmake it all States, and let the People decide at once.  I will agree to\r\nplace them in that condition where the prohibition of Slavery will never\r\nbe necessary to justify ourselves to our consciences or to our\r\nconstituents.  I will agree to anything which is not to force upon me\r\nthe necessity of protecting Slavery in the name of Freedom.  To that I\r\nnever can and never will yield.\"\r\n\r\nThe speeches of Seward, of Douglas, of Crittenden, of Andrew Johnson, of\r\nBaker, and others, in behalf of the Union, and those of Benjamin, Davis,\r\nWigfall, Lane, and others, in behalf of Secession, did much toward\r\nfixing the responsibility for the approaching bloody conflict where it\r\nbelonged.  The speeches of Andrew Johnson of Tennessee--who, if he at a\r\nsubsequent period of the Nation's history, proved himself not the\r\nworthiest son of the Republic, at this critical time, at all events, did\r\ngrand service in the National Senate--especially had great and good\r\neffect on the public mind in the Northern and Border States.  They were,\r\ntherefore, gall and wormwood to the Secession leaders, who hoped to drag\r\nthe Border States into the great Southern Confederacy of States already\r\nin process of formation.\r\n\r\nTheir irritation was shown in threats of personal violence to Mr.\r\nJohnson, as when Wigfall--replying February 7th, 1861, to the latter's\r\nspeech, said, \"Now if the Senator wishes to denounce Secession and\r\nNullification eo nomine, let him go back and denounce Jefferson; let him\r\ndenounce Jackson, if he dare, and go back and look that Tennessee\r\nDemocracy in the face, and see whether they will content themselves with\r\nriddling his effigy!\"\r\n\r\nIt would seem also, from another part of Wigfall's reply, that the\r\nspeeches of Union Senators had been so effective that a necessity was\r\nfelt on the part of the Southern Conspirators to still further attempt\r\nto justify Secession by shifting the blame to Northern shoulders, for,\r\nwhile referring to the Presidential canvass of 1860--and the attitude of\r\nthe Southern Secession leaders during that exciting period--he said:\r\n\"We (Breckinridge-Democrats) gave notice, both North and South, that if\r\nAbraham Lincoln was elected, this Union was dissolved.  I never made a\r\nspeech during the canvass without asserting that fact.  * * *  Then, I\r\nsay, that our purpose was not to dissolve the Union; but the dire\r\nnecessity has been put upon us.  The question is, whether we shall live\r\nlonger in a Union in which a Party, hostile to us in every respect, has\r\nthe power in Congress, in the Executive department, and in the Electoral\r\nColleges--a Party who will have the power even in the Judiciary.  We\r\nthink it is not safe.  We say that each State has the clear indisputable\r\nright to withdraw if she sees fit; and six of the States have already\r\nwithdrawn, and one other State is upon the eve of withdrawing, if she\r\nhas not already done so.  How far this will spread no man can tell!\"\r\n\r\nAs tending to show the peculiar mixture of brag, cajolery, and threats,\r\ninvolved in the attitude of the South, as expressed by the same favorite\r\nSouthern mouthpiece, toward the Border-States on the one hand, and the\r\nMiddle and New England States on the other, a further extract from this\r\n(February 7th) speech of the Texan Senator may be of interest.  Said he:\r\n\r\n\"With exports to the amount of hundreds of millions of dollars, our\r\nimports must be the same.  With a lighter Tariff than any people ever\r\nundertook to live under, we could have larger revenue.  We would be able\r\nto stand Direct Taxation to a greater extent than any people ever could\r\nbefore, since the creation of the World.  We feel perfectly competent to\r\nmeet all issues that may be presented, either by hostility from abroad\r\nor treason at home.  So far as the Border-States are concerned, it is a\r\nmatter that concerns them alone.  Should they confederate with us,\r\nbeyond all doubt New England machinery will be worked with the water\r\npower of Tennessee, of Kentucky, of Virginia and of Maryland; the Tariff\r\nlaws that now give New England the monopoly in the thirty-three States,\r\nwill give to these Border States a monopoly in the Slave-holding States.\r\nShould the non-Slave-holding States choose to side against us in\r\norganizing their Governments, and cling to their New England brethren,\r\nthe only result will be, that the meat, the horses, the hemp, and the\r\ngrain, which we now buy in Pennsylvania, in Ohio, in Indiana and\r\nIllinois, will be purchased in Kentucky and in Western Virginia and in\r\nMissouri.  Should Pennsylvania stand out, the only result will be, that\r\nthe iron which is now dug in Pennsylvania, will be dug in the mountains\r\nof Tennessee and of Virginia and of Kentucky and of North Carolina.\r\nThese things we know.\r\n\r\n\"We feel no anxiety at all, so far as money or men are concerned.  We\r\ndesire War with nobody; we intend to make no War; but we intend to live\r\nunder just such a Government as we see fit.  Six States have left this\r\nUnion, and others are going to leave it simply because they choose to do\r\nit; that is all.  We do not ask your consent; we do not wish it.  We\r\nhave revoked our ratification of the Treaty commonly known as the\r\nConstitution of the United States; a treaty for common defense and\r\ngeneral welfare; and we shall be perfectly willing to enter into another\r\nTreaty with you, of peace and amity.  Reject the olive branch and offer\r\nus the sword, and we accept it; we have not the slightest objection.\r\nUpon that subject we feel as the great William Lowndes felt upon another\r\nimportant subject, the Presidency, which he said was neither to be\r\nsought nor declined.  When you invade our soil, look to your own\r\nborders.  You say that you have too many people, too many towns, too\r\ndense a population, for us to invade you.  I say to you Senators, that\r\nthere is nothing that ever stops the march of an invading force, except\r\na desert.  The more populous a country, the more easy it is to subsist\r\nan army.\"\r\n\r\nAfter declaring that--\"Not only are our non-Slaveholders loyal, but even\r\nour Negroes are.  We have no apprehensions whatever of insurrection--not\r\nthe slightest.  We can arm our negroes, and leave them at home, when we\r\nare temporarily absent\"--Mr. Wigfall proceeded to say: \"We may as well\r\ntalk plainly about this matter.  This is probably the last time I shall\r\nhave an opportunity of addressing you.  There is another thing that an\r\ninvading army cannot do.  It cannot burn up plantations.  You can pull\r\ndown fences, but the Negroes will put them up the next morning.  The\r\nworst fuel that ever a man undertook to make fire with, is dirt; it will\r\nnot burn.  Now I have told you what an invading army cannot do.  Suppose\r\nI reverse the picture and tell you what it can do.  An invading army in\r\nan enemy's country, where there is a dense population, can subsist\r\nitself at a very little cost; it does not always pay for what it gets.\r\nAn invading army can burn down towns; an invading army can burn down\r\nmanufactories; and it can starve operatives.  It can do all these\r\nthings.  But an Invading army, and an army to defend a Country, both\r\nrequire a military chest.  You may bankrupt every man south of North\r\nCarolina, so that his credit is reduced to such a point that he could\r\nnot discount a note for thirty dollars, at thirty days; but the next\r\nautumn those Cotton States will have just as much money and as much\r\ncredit as they had before.  They pick money off the cotton plant.  Every\r\ntime that a Negro touches a cotton-pod with his hand, he pulls a piece\r\nof silver out of it, and he drops it into the basket in which it is\r\ncarried to the gin-house.  It is carried to the packing screw.  A bale\r\nof cotton rolls out-in other words, five ten-dollar pieces roll out\r\n--covered with canvas.  We shall never again make less than five million\r\nbales of cotton.  * * *  We can produce five million bales of cotton,\r\nevery bale worth fifty dollars, which is the lowest market price it has\r\nbeen for years past.  We shall import a bale of something else, for\r\nevery bale of cotton that we export, and that bale will be worth fifty\r\ndollars.  We shall find no difficulty under a War-Tariff in raising an\r\nabundance of money.  We have been at Peace for a very long time, We are\r\nvery prosperous.  Our planters use their cotton, not to buy the\r\nnecessaries of life, but for the superfluities, which they can do\r\nwithout.  The States themselves have a mine of wealth in the loyalty and\r\nthe wealth of their citizens.  Georgia, Mississippi, any one of those\r\nStates can issue its six per cent. bonds tomorrow, and receive cotton in\r\npayment to the extent almost of the entire crop.  They can first borrow\r\nfrom their own citizens; they can tax them to an almost unlimited\r\nextent; and they can raise revenue from a Tariff to an almost unlimited\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n\"How will it be with New England?  where will their revenue come from?\r\nFrom your Custom-houses?  what do you export?  You have been telling us\r\nhere for the last quarter of a century, that you cannot manufacture,\r\neven for the home market, under the Tariffs which we have given you.\r\nWhen this Tariff ceases to operate in your favor, and you have to pay\r\nfor coming into our markets, what will you export?  When your machinery\r\nceases to move, and your operatives are turned out, will you tax your\r\nbroken capitalist or your starving operative?  When the navigation laws\r\ncease to operate, what will become of your shipping interest?  You are\r\ngoing to blockade our ports, you say.  That is a very innocent game; and\r\nyou suppose we shall sit quietly down and submit to a blockade.  I speak\r\nnot of foreign interference, for we look not for it.  We are just as\r\ncompetent to take Queen Victoria and Louis Napoleon under our\r\nprotection, as they are to take us; and they are a great deal more\r\ninterested to-day in receiving cotton from our ports than we are in\r\nshipping it.  You may lock up every bale of cotton within the limits of\r\nthe eight Cotton States, and not allow us to export one for three years,\r\nand we shall not feel it further than our military resources are\r\nconcerned.  Exhaust the supply of cotton in Europe for one week, and all\r\nEurope is in revolution.\r\n\r\n\"These are facts.  You will blockade us!  Do you suppose we shall do\r\nnothing, even upon the sea?  How many letters of marque and reprisal\r\nwould it take to put the whole of your ships up at your wharves to rot?\r\nWill any merchant at Havre, or Liverpool, or any other portion of the\r\nhabitable globe, ship a cargo upon a New England, or New York, or\r\nPhiladelphia clipper, or other ship, when he knows that the seas are\r\nswarming with letters of marque and reprisal?  Why the mere apprehension\r\nof such a thing will cut you out of the Carrying Trade of the civilized\r\nWorld.  * * *  I speak not of the absurdity of the position that you can\r\nblockade our ports, admitting at the same time that we are in the Union.\r\nBlockade is a remedy, as all writers on International law say, against a\r\nForeign Power with whom you are at War.  You cannot use a blockade\r\nagainst your own people.  An embargo even, you cannot use.  That is a\r\nremedy against a Foreign Nation with whom you expect to be at War.  You\r\nmust treat us as in the Union, or out of it.  We have gone out.  We are\r\nwilling to live at peace with you; but, as sure as fate, whenever any\r\nflag comes into one of our ports, that has thirty-three stars upon it,\r\nthat flag will be fired at.  Displaying a flag with stars which we have\r\nplucked from that bright galaxy, is an insult to the State within whose\r\nwaters that flag is displayed.  You cannot enforce the laws without\r\nCoercion, and you cannot Coerce without War.\r\n\r\n\"These matters, then, can be settled.  How?  By withdrawing your troops;\r\nadmitting our right to Self-government clearly, unqualifiedly.  Do this,\r\nand there is no difficulty about it.  You say that you will not do it.\r\nVery well; we have no objection--none whatever.  That is Coercion.  When\r\nyou have attempted it, you will find that you have made War.  These,\r\nSenators, are facts.  I come here to plead for Peace; but I have seen so\r\nmuch and felt so much, that I am becoming at last, to tell the plain\r\ntruth of the matter, rather indifferent as to which way the thing turns.\r\nIf you want War, you can have it.  If you want Peace, you can get it;\r\nbut I plead not for Peace.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Seceding States of the South were strengthening their\r\nattitude by Confederation.  On February 4, 1861, the Convention of\r\nSeceding States, called by the South Carolina Convention at the time of\r\nher Secession, met, in pursuance of that call, at Montgomery, Alabama,\r\nand on the 9th adopted a Provisional Constitution and organized a\r\nProvisional Government by the election of Jefferson Davis of\r\nMississippi, as President, and Alexander H. Stephens of Georgia, as\r\nVice-President; to serve until a Presidential election could be held by\r\nthe people of the Confederacy.\r\n\r\n     [At a later day, March 11, 1861, a permanent Constitution for the\r\n     \"Confederate States\" was adopted, and, in the Fall of the same\r\n     year, Messrs.  Davis and Stephens were elected by popular vote, for\r\n     the term of six years ensuing, as President and Vice-President,\r\n     respectively, of the Confederacy.]\r\n\r\nMr. Davis almost at once left Jackson, Mississippi, for Montgomery,\r\nwhere he arrived and delivered his Inaugural, February 17, having\r\nreceived on his road thither a succession of ovations from the\r\nenthusiastic Rebels, to which he had responded with no less than\r\ntwenty-five speeches, very similar in tone to those made in the United\r\nStates Senate by Mr. Wigfall and others of that ilk--breathing at once\r\ndefiance and hopefulness, while admitting the difficulties in the way\r\nof the new Confederacy.\r\n\r\n\"It may be,\" said he, at Jackson, \"that we will be confronted by War;\r\nthat the attempt will be made to blockade our ports, to starve us out;\r\nbut they (the Union men of the North) know little of the Southern heart,\r\nof Southern endurance.  No amount of privation could force us to remain\r\nin a Union on unequal terms.  England and France would not allow our\r\ngreat staple to be dammed up within our present limits; the starving\r\nthousands in their midst would not allow it.  We have nothing to\r\napprehend from Blockade.  But if they attempt invasion by land, we must\r\ntake the War out of our territory.  If War must come, it must be upon\r\nNorthern, and not upon Southern soil.  In the meantime, if they were\r\nprepared to grant us Peace, to recognize our equality, all is well.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, in his speech at Stevenson, Alabama, said he \"Your Border States\r\nwill gladly come into the Southern Confederacy within sixty days, as we\r\nwill be their only friends.  England will recognize us, and a glorious\r\nfuture is before us.  The grass will grow in the Northern cities, where\r\nthe pavements have been worn off by the tread of Commerce.  We will\r\ncarry War where it is easy to advance--where food for the sword and\r\ntorch await our Armies in the densely populated cities; and though they\r\nmay come and spoil our crops, we can raise them as before; while they\r\ncannot rear the cities which took years of industry and millions of\r\nmoney to build.\"\r\n\r\nVery different in tone to these, were the kindly and sensible utterances\r\nof Mr. Lincoln on his journey from Springfield to Washington, about the\r\nsame time, for Inauguration as President of the United States.  Leaving\r\nSpringfield, Illinois, February 11th, he had pathetically said:\r\n\r\n\"My friends: No one, not in my position, can realize the sadness I feel\r\nat this parting.  To this people I owe all that I am.  Here I have lived\r\nmore than a quarter of a century.  Here my children were born, and here\r\none of them lies buried.  I know not how soon I shall see you again.  I\r\ngo to assume a task more difficult than that which has devolved upon any\r\nother man since the days of Washington.  He never would have succeeded\r\nexcept for the aid of Divine Providence, upon which he at all times\r\nrelied.  I feel that I cannot succeed without the same Divine blessing\r\nwhich sustained him; and on the same Almighty Being I place my reliance\r\nfor support.  And I hope you, my friends, will all pray that I may\r\nreceive that Divine assistance, without which I cannot succeed, but with\r\nwhich success is certain.  Again I bid you an affectionate farewell.\"\r\n\r\nAt Indianapolis, that evening, the eve of his birthday anniversary,\r\nafter thanking the assembled thousands for their \"magnificent welcome,\"\r\nand defining the words \"Coercion\" and \"Invasion\"--at that time so\r\nloosely used--he continued: \"But if the United States should merely hold\r\nand retake her own Forts and other property, and collect the duties on\r\nforeign importation, or even withhold the mails from places where they\r\nwere habitually violated, would any or all of these things be 'Invasion'\r\nor 'Coercion'?  Do our professed lovers of the Union, who spitefully\r\nresolve that they will resist Coercion and Invasion, understand that\r\nsuch things as these on the part of the United States would be\r\n'Coercion' or 'Invasion' of a State?  If so, their idea of means to\r\npreserve the object of their great affection would seem to be\r\nexceedingly thin and airy.\"\r\n\r\nAt Columbus, Ohio, he spoke in a like calm, conservative, reasoning way\r\n--with the evident purpose of throwing oil on the troubled waters--when\r\nhe said: \"I have not maintained silence from any want of real anxiety.\r\nIt is a good thing that there is no more than anxiety; for there is\r\nnothing going wrong.  It is a consoling circumstance that, when we look\r\nout, there is nothing that really hurts anybody.  We entertain different\r\nviews upon political questions; but nobody is suffering anything.  This\r\nis a consoling circumstance; and from it we may conclude that all we\r\nwant is time, patience, and a reliance on that God who has never\r\nforsaken this People.\"\r\n\r\nSo, too, at Pittsburg, Pa., February 15th, he said, of \"our friends,\" as\r\nhe termed them, the Secessionists: \"Take even their own views of the\r\nquestions involved, and there is nothing to justify the course they are\r\npursuing.  I repeat, then, there is no crisis, except such an one as may\r\nbe gotten up at any time by turbulent men, aided by designing\r\npoliticians.  My advice to them, under the circumstances, is to keep\r\ncool.  If the great American People only keep their temper both sides of\r\nthe line, the trouble will come to an end, and the question which now\r\ndistracts the Country be settled, just as surely as all other\r\ndifficulties, of a like character, which have been originated in this\r\nGovernment, have been adjusted.  Let the people on both sides keep their\r\nself-possession, and, just as other clouds have cleared away in due\r\ntime, so will this great Nation continue to prosper as heretofore.\"\r\n\r\nAnd toward the end of that journey, on the 22nd of February\r\n--Washington's Birthday--in the Independence Hall at Philadelphia, after\r\neloquently affirming his belief that \"the great principle or idea that\r\nkept this Confederacy so long together was * * * that sentiment in the\r\nDeclaration of Independence which gave Liberty not alone to the People\r\nof this Country, but\" he hoped \"to the World, for all future time * * *\r\nwhich gave promise that, in due time, the weight would be lifted from\r\nthe shoulders of all men\"--he added, in the same firm, yet temperate and\r\nreassuring vein: \"Now, my friends, can this Country be saved on that\r\nbasis?  If it can, I will consider myself one of the happiest men in the\r\nworld, if I can help to save it.  If it cannot be saved on that basis,\r\nit will be truly awful.  But, if this Country cannot be saved without\r\ngiving up that principle, I was about to say I would rather be\r\nassassinated on this spot than surrender it.  Now in my view of the\r\npresent aspect of affairs, there need be no bloodshed or War.  There is\r\nno necessity for it.  I am not in favor of such a course; and I may say,\r\nin advance, that there will be no bloodshed, unless it be forced upon\r\nthe Government, and then it will be compelled to act in self-defense.  *\r\n* * I have said nothing but what I am willing to live by, and, if it be\r\nthe pleasure of Almighty God, to die by.\"\r\n\r\nThus, as he progressed on that memorable journey from his home in\r\nIllinois, through Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Columbus, Pittsburgh,\r\nCleveland, Erie, Buffalo, Albany, New York, Trenton, Newark,\r\nPhiladelphia, and Harrisburg-amid the prayers and blessings and\r\nacclamations of an enthusiastic and patriotic people--he uttered words\r\nof wise conciliation and firm moderation such as beseemed the high\r\nfunctions and tremendous responsibilities to which the voice of that\r\nliberty--and-union-loving people had called him, and this too, with a\r\nfull knowledge, when he made the Philadelphia speech, that the enemies\r\nof the Republic had already planned to assassinate him before he could\r\nreach Washington.\r\n\r\nThe prudence of his immediate friends, fortunately defeated the\r\nmurderous purpose--and by the simple device of taking the regular night\r\nexpress from Philadelphia instead of a special train next day--to\r\nWashington, he reached the National Capital without molestation early on\r\nthe morning of the 23rd of February.\r\n\r\nThat morning, after Mr. Lincoln's arrival, in company with Mr. Lovejoy,\r\nthe writer visited him at Willard's Hotel.  During the interview both\r\nurged him to \"Go right along, protect the property of the Country, and\r\nput down the Rebellion, no matter at what cost in men and money.\"  He\r\nlistened with grave attention, and said little, but very clearly\r\nindicated his approval of all the sentiments thus expressed--and then,\r\nwith the same firm and manly and cheerful faith in the outcome, he\r\nadded: \"As the Country has placed me at the helm of the Ship, I'll try\r\nto steer her through.\"\r\n\r\nThe spirit in which he proposed to accomplish this superhuman task, was\r\nshown when he told the Southern people through the Civic authorities of\r\nWashington on the 27th of February--When the latter called upon him\r\n--that he had no desire or intention to interfere with any of their\r\nConstitutional rights--that they should have all their rights under the\r\nConstitution, \"not grudgingly, but fully and fairly.\"  And what was the\r\nresponse of the South to this generous and conciliatory message?\r\nPersonal sneers--imputations of Northern cowardice--boasts of Southern\r\nprowess--scornful rejection of all compromise--and an insolent challenge\r\nto the bloody issue of arms!\r\n\r\nSaid Mr. Wigfall, in the United States Senate, on March 2d, alluding to\r\nMr. Lincoln, \"I do not think that a man who disguises himself in a\r\nsoldier's cloak and a Scotch cap (a more thorough disguise could not be\r\nassumed by such a man) and makes his entry between day and day, into the\r\nCapital of the Country that he is to govern--I hardly think that he is\r\ngoing to look War sternly in the face.\r\n\r\n     [Had Mr. Wigfall been able at this time to look four years into the\r\n     future and behold the downfall of the Southern Rebellion, the\r\n     flight of its Chieftains, and the capture of Jefferson Davis while\r\n     endeavoring to escape, with his body enclosed in a wrapper and a\r\n     woman's shawl over his head, as stated by Lieutenant-Colonel Stuart\r\n     of Jefferson Davis's Staff, p. 756, vol. ii., Greeley's American\r\n     Conflict--he would hardly have retailed this slander.]\r\n\r\n\"I look for nothing else than that the Commissioners from the\r\nConfederated States will be received here and recognized by Abraham\r\nLincoln.  I will now predict that this Republican Party that is going to\r\nenforce the Laws, preserve the Union, and collect Revenue, will never\r\nattempt anything so silly; and that instead of taking Forts, the troops\r\nwill be withdrawn from those which we now have.  See if this does not\r\nturn out to be so, in less than a week or ten days.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same insulting diatribe, he said: \"It is very easy for men to\r\nbluster who know there is going to be no danger.  Four or five million\r\npeople living in a territory that extends from North Carolina down to\r\nthe Rio Grande, who have exports to above three hundred million dollars,\r\nwhose ports cannot be blockaded, but who can issue letters of marque and\r\nreprisal, and sweep your commerce from the seas, and who will do it, are\r\nnot going to be trifled with by that sensible Yankee nation.  Mark my\r\nwords.  I did think, at one time, there was going to be War; I do not\r\nthink so now.  * * *  The Star of the West swaggered into Charleston\r\nharbor, received a blow planted full in the face, and staggered out.\r\nYour flag has been insulted; redress it if you dare!  You have submitted\r\nto it for two months, and you will submit to it for ever.  * * *  We\r\nhave dissolved the Union; mend it if you can; cement it with blood; try\r\nthe experiment! we do not desire War; we wish to avoid it.  * * *  This\r\nwe say; and if you choose to settle this question by the Sword, we feel,\r\nwe know, that we have the Right.  We interfere with you in no way.  We\r\nask simply that you will not interfere with us.  * * *  You tell us you\r\nwill keep us in the Union.  Try the experiment!\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, with brutal frankness, he continued: \"Now, whether what are\r\ncalled The Crittenden Resolutions will produce satisfaction in some of\r\nthese Border States, or not, I am unaware; but I feel perfectly sure\r\nthey would not be entertained upon the Gulf.  As to the Resolutions\r\nwhich the Peace Congress has offered us, we might as well make a clean\r\nbreast of it.  If those Resolutions were adopted, and ratified by three\r\nfourths of the States of this Union, and no other cause ever existed, I\r\nmake the assertion that the seven States now out of the Union, would go\r\nout upon that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                       THE REJECTED OLIVE BRANCH.\r\n\r\nWhile instructive, it will also not be devoid of interest, to pause\r\nhere, and examine the nature of the Crittenden Resolutions, and also the\r\nResolutions of the Peace Congress, which, we have seen, were spurned by\r\nthe Secession leaders, through their chief mouthpiece in the United\r\nStates Senate.\r\n\r\nThe Crittenden Compromise Resolutions * were in these words:\r\n\r\n\"A Joint Resolution proposing certain Amendments to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, serious and alarming dissensions have arisen between the\r\nNorthern and the Southern States, concerning the Rights and security of\r\nthe Rights of the Slaveholding States, and especially their Rights in\r\nthe common territory of the United States; and whereas, it is eminently\r\ndesirable and proper that these dissensions, which now threaten the very\r\nexistence of this Union, should be permanently quieted and settled by\r\nConstitutional provisions which shall do equal justice to all Sections,\r\nand thereby restore to the People that peace and good-will which ought\r\nto prevail between all the citizens of the United States; Therefore:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America, in Congress assembled, (two thirds of both Houses\r\nconcurring), the following articles be, and are hereby proposed and\r\nsubmitted as amendments to the Constitution of the United States, which\r\nshall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of said\r\nConstitution, when ratified by Conventions of three-fourths of the\r\nseveral States:\r\n\r\n\"Article I.  In all the territory of the United States now held, or\r\nhereafter to be acquired, situate north of latitude 36  30', Slavery or\r\ninvoluntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, is prohibited,\r\nwhile such territory shall remain under Territorial government.  In all\r\nthe territory south of said line of latitude, Slavery of the African\r\nrace is hereby recognized as existing, and shall not be interfered with\r\nby Congress, but shall be protected as Property by all the departments\r\nof the Territorial government during its continuance.  And when any\r\nTerritory, north or south of said line, within such boundaries as\r\nCongress may prescribe, shall contain the population requisite for a\r\nmember of Congress, according to the then Federal ratio of\r\nrepresentation of the People of the United States, it shall, if its own\r\nform of government be republican, be admitted into the Union, on an\r\nequal footing with the original States; with or without Slavery, as the\r\nConstitution of such new State may provide.\r\n\r\n\"Article II.  Congress shall have no power to abolish Slavery in places\r\nunder its exclusive jurisdiction, and situate within the limits of\r\nStates that permit the holding of Slaves.\r\n\r\n\"Article III.  Congress shall have no power to abolish Slavery within\r\nthe District of Columbia; so long as it exists in the adjoining States\r\nof Virginia and Maryland, or either, nor without the consent of the\r\ninhabitants, nor without just compensation first made to such owners of\r\nSlaves as do not consent to such abolishment.  Nor shall Congress, at\r\nany time, prohibit officers of the Federal government, or members of\r\nCongress whose duties require them to be in said District, from bringing\r\nwith them their Slaves, and holding them as such during the time their\r\nduties may require them to remain there, and afterward taking them from\r\nthe District.\r\n\r\n\"Article IV.  Congress shall have no power to prohibit or hinder the\r\nTransportation of Slaves from one State to another, or to a Territory in\r\nwhich Slaves are, by law, permitted to be held, whether that\r\ntransportation be by land, navigable rivers, or by the sea.\r\n\r\n\"Article V.  That in addition to the provisions of the third paragraph\r\nof the second section of the fourth article of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, Congress shall have power to provide by law, and it shall\r\nbe its duty to provide, that the United States shall pay to the owner\r\nwho shall apply for it, the full value of his Fugitive Slaves in all\r\ncases where the Marshal, or other officer whose duty it was to arrest\r\nsaid Fugitive, was prevented from so doing by violence or intimidation,\r\nor where, after arrest, said Fugitive was rescued by force, and the\r\nowner thereby prevented and obstructed in the pursuit of his remedy for\r\nthe recovery of his Fugitive Slave under the said clause of the\r\nConstitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof.\r\n\r\n     [\"No Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws\r\n     thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any Law or\r\n     Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour, but\r\n     shall be delivered up on claim of the Party to whom such Service or\r\n     Labour may be due.\"--Art.  IV., Sec.  2, P 3, U. S. Constitution.]\r\n\r\n\"And in all such cases, when the United States shall pay for such\r\nFugitive, they shall have the Right, in their own name, to sue the\r\ncounty in which said violence, intimidation, or rescue, was committed,\r\nand recover from it, with interest and damages, the amount paid by them\r\nfor said Fugitive Slave.  And the said county, after it has paid said\r\namount to the United States, may, for its indemnity, sue and recover\r\nfrom the wrong-doers or rescuers by whom the owner was prevented from\r\nthe recovery of his Fugitive Slave, in like manner as the owner himself\r\nmight have sued and recovered.\r\n\r\n\"Article VI.  No future amendment of the Constitution shall affect the\r\nfive preceding articles; nor the third paragraph of the second section\r\nof the first article of the Constitution, nor the third paragraph  of\r\nthe second section of the fourth article of said Constitution; and no\r\namendment shall be made to the Constitution which shall authorize or\r\ngive to Congress any power to abolish or interfere with Slavery in any\r\nof the States by whose laws it is or may be, allowed or permitted.\r\n\r\n     [\"Representatives and Direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the\r\n     several States which may be included within this Union, according\r\n     to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to\r\n     the whole Number of Free Persons, including those bound to Service\r\n     for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not Taxed, three-fifths\r\n     of all Other Persons,\" etc.--Art. 1., Sec.  2, P 3, U. S.\r\n     Constitution.]\r\n\r\n\"And whereas, also, besides those causes of dissension embraced in the\r\nforegoing amendments proposed to the Constitution of the United States,\r\nthere are others which come within the jurisdiction of Congress, and may\r\nbe remedied by its legislative power; And whereas it is the desire of\r\nCongress, as far as its power will extend, to remove all just cause for\r\nthe popular discontent and agitation which now disturb the peace of the\r\nCountry and threaten the stability of its Institutions; Therefore:\r\n\r\n\"1.  Resolved by the Senate and house of Representatives in Congress\r\nassembled, that the laws now in force for the recovery of Fugitive\r\nSlaves are in strict pursuance of the plain and mandatory provisions of\r\nthe Constitution, and have been sanctioned as valid and Constitutional\r\nby the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States; that the\r\nSlaveholding States are entitled to the faithful observance and\r\nexecution of those laws; and that they ought not to be repealed, or so\r\nmodified or changed as to impair their efficiency; and that laws ought\r\nto be made for the punishment of those who attempt, by rescue of the\r\nSlave, or other illegal means, to hinder or defeat the due execution of\r\nsaid laws.\r\n\r\n\"2.  That all State laws which conflict with the Fugitive Slave Acts of\r\nCongress, or any other Constitutional Acts of Congress, or which, in\r\ntheir operation, impede, hinder, or delay, the free course and due\r\nexecution of any of said Acts, are null and void by the plain provisions\r\nof the Constitution of the United States; yet those State laws, void as\r\nthey are, have given color to practices, and led to consequences, which\r\nhave obstructed the due administration and execution of Acts of\r\nCongress, and especially the Acts for the delivery of Fugitive Slaves;\r\nand have thereby contributed much to the discord and commotion now\r\nprevailing.  Congress, therefore, in the present perilous juncture, does\r\nnot deem it improper, respectfully and earnestly, to recommend the\r\nrepeal of those laws to the several States which have enacted them, or\r\nsuch legislative corrections or explanations of them as may prevent\r\ntheir being used or perverted to such mischievous purposes.\r\n\r\n\"3.  That the Act of the 18th of September, 1850, commonly called the\r\nFugitive Slave Law, ought to be so amended as to make the fee of the\r\nCommissioner, mentioned in the eighth section of the Act, equal in\r\namount in the cases decided by him, whether his decision be in favor of,\r\nor against the claimant.  And, to avoid misconstruction, the last clause\r\nof the fifth section of said Act, which authorizes the person holding a\r\nwarrant for the arrest or detention of a Fugitive Slave to summon to his\r\naid the posse comitatus, and which declares it to be the duty of all\r\ngood citizens to assist him in its execution, ought to be so amended as\r\nto expressly limit the authority and duty to cases in which there shall\r\nbe resistance, or danger of resistance or rescue.\r\n\r\n\"4.  That the laws for the suppression of the African Slave Trade, and\r\nespecially those prohibiting the importation of Slaves into the United\r\nStates, ought to be more effectual, and ought to be thoroughly executed;\r\nand all further enactments necessary to those ends ought to be promptly\r\nmade.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Peace Conference, or \"Congress,\" it may here be mentioned, was\r\ncalled, by action of the Legislature of Virginia, to meet at Washington,\r\nFebruary 4, 1861.  The invitation was extended to all of such \"States of\r\nthis Confederacy * * *  whether Slaveholding or Non-Slaveholding, as are\r\nwilling to unite with Virginia in an earnest effort to adjust the\r\npresent unhappy controversies in the spirit in which the Constitution\r\nwas originally formed, and consistently with its principles, so as to\r\nafford to the people of the Slaveholding States adequate guarantees for\r\nthe security of their rights\"--such States to be represented by\r\nCommissioners \"to consider, and, if practicable, agree upon some\r\nsuitable adjustment.\"\r\n\r\nThe Conference, or \"Congress,\" duly convened, at that place and time,\r\nand organized by electing ex-President John Tyler, of Virginia, its\r\nPresident.  This Peace Congress--which comprised 133 Commissioners,\r\nrepresenting the States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,\r\nRhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,\r\nMaryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio,\r\nIndiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin and Kansas--remained in session until\r\nFebruary 27, 1861--and then submitted the result of its labors to\r\nCongress, with the request that Congress \"will submit it to Conventions\r\nin the States, as Article Thirteen of the Amendments to the Constitution\r\nof the United States, in the following shape:\r\n\r\n\"Section 1.  In all the present territory of the United States, north of\r\nthe parallel of 36  30' of north latitude, Involuntary Servitude, except\r\nin punishment of crime, is prohibited.  In all the present territory\r\nsouth of that line, the status of Persons held to Involuntary Service or\r\nLabor, as it now exists, shall not be changed; nor shall any law be\r\npassed by Congress or the Territorial Legislature to hinder or prevent\r\nthe taking of such Persons from any of the States of this Union to said\r\nTerritory, nor to impair the Rights arising from said relation; but the\r\nsame shall be subject to judicial cognizance in the Federal Courts,\r\naccording to the course of the common law.  When any Territory north or\r\nsouth of said line, within such boundary as Congress may prescribe,\r\nshall contain a population equal to that required for a member of\r\nCongress, it shall, if its form of government be republican, be admitted\r\ninto the Union on an equal footing with the original States, with or\r\nwithout Involuntary Servitude, as the Constitution of such State may\r\nprovide.\r\n\r\n\"Section 2.  No territory shall be acquired by the United States, except\r\nby discovery and for naval and commercial stations, depots, and transit\r\nroutes, without the concurrence of a majority of all the Senators from\r\nStates which allow Involuntary Servitude, and a majority of all the\r\nSenators from States which prohibit that relation; nor shall Territory\r\nbe acquired by treaty, unless the votes of a majority of the Senators\r\nfrom each class of States hereinbefore mentioned be cast as a part of\r\nthe two-thirds majority necessary to the ratification of such treaty.\r\n\r\n\"Section 3.  Neither the Constitution, nor any amendment thereof, shall\r\nbe construed to give Congress power to regulate, abolish, or control,\r\nwithin any State, the relation established or recognized by the laws\r\nthereof touching Persons held to Labor or Involuntary Service therein,\r\nnor to interfere with or abolish Involuntary Service in the District of\r\nColumbia without the consent of Maryland, and without the consent of the\r\nowners, or making the owners who do not consent just compensation; nor\r\nthe power to interfere with or prohibit Representatives and others from\r\nbringing with them to the District of Columbia, retaining, and taking\r\naway, Persons so held to Labor or Service; nor the power to interfere\r\nwith or abolish Involuntary Service in places under the exclusive\r\njurisdiction of the United States within those States and Territories\r\nwhere the same is established or recognized; nor the power to prohibit\r\nthe removal or transportation of Persons held to Labor or Involuntary\r\nService in any State or Territory of the United States to any other\r\nState or Territory thereof where it is established or recognized by law\r\nor usage; and the right during transportation, by sea or river, of\r\ntouching at ports, shores, and landings, and of landing in case of\r\ndistress, shall exist; but not the right of transit in or through any\r\nState or Territory, or of sale or traffic, against the laws thereof.\r\nNor shall Congress have power to authorize any higher rate of taxation\r\non Persons held to Labor or Service than on land.  The bringing into the\r\nDistrict of Columbia of Persons held to Labor or Service, for sale, or\r\nplacing them in depots to be afterwards transferred to other places for\r\nsale as merchandize, is prohibited.\r\n\r\n\"Section 4.  The third paragraph of the second section of the fourth\r\narticle of the Constitution shall not be construed to prevent any of the\r\nStates, by appropriate legislation, and through the action of their\r\njudicial and ministerial officers, from enforcing the delivery of\r\nFugitives from Labor to the person to whom such Service or Labor is due.\r\n\r\n\"Section 5.  The Foreign Slave Trade is hereby forever prohibited; and\r\nit shall be the duty of Congress to pass laws to prevent the importation\r\nof Slaves, Coolies, or Persons held to Service or Labor, into the United\r\nStates and the Territories from places beyond the limits thereof.\r\n\r\n\"Section 6.  The first, third, and fifth sections, together with this\r\nsection of these amendments, and the third paragraph of the second\r\nsection of the first article of the Constitution, and the third\r\nparagraph of the second section of the fourth article thereof, shall not\r\nbe amended or abolished without the consent of all the States.\r\n\r\n\"Section 7.  Congress shall provide by law that the United States shall\r\npay to the owner the full value of the Fugitive from Labor, in all cases\r\nwhere the Marshal, or other officer, whose duty it was to arrest such\r\nFugitive, was prevented from so doing by violence or intimidation from\r\nmobs or riotous assemblages, or when, after arrest, such Fugitive was\r\nrescued by like violence or intimidation, and the owner thereby deprived\r\nof the same; and the acceptance of such payment shall preclude the owner\r\nfrom further claim to such Fugitive.  Congress shall provide by law for\r\nsecuring to the citizens of each State the privileges and immunities of\r\ncitizens in the several States.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTo spurn such propositions as these--with all the concessions to the\r\nSlave Power therein contained--was equivalent to spurning any and all\r\npropositions that could possibly be made; and by doing this, the\r\nSeceding States placed themselves--as they perhaps desired--in an\r\nutterly irreconcilable attitude, and hence, to a certain extent, which\r\nhad not entered into their calculations, weakened their \"Cause\" in the\r\neyes of many of their friends in the North, in the Border States, and in\r\nthe World.  They had become Implacables.  Practically considered, this\r\nwas their great mistake.  The Crittenden Compromise Resolutions covered\r\nand yielded to the Slaveholders of the South all and even more than they\r\nhad ever dared seriously to ask or hope for, and had they been open to\r\nConciliation, they could have undoubtedly carried that measure through\r\nboth Houses of Congress and three-fourths of the States.\r\n\r\n     [\"Its advocates, with good reason, claimed a large majority of the\r\n     People in its favor, and clamored for its submission to a direct\r\n     popular vote.  Had such a submission been accorded, it is very\r\n     likely that the greater number of those who voted at all would have\r\n     voted to ratify it.  * * *  The 'Conservatives,' so called, were\r\n     still able to establish this Crittenden Compromise by their own\r\n     proper strength, had they been disposed so to do.  The President\r\n     was theirs; the Senate strongly theirs; in the House, they had a\r\n     small majority, as was evidenced in their defeat of John Sherman\r\n     for Speaker.  Had they now come forward and said, with authority:\r\n     'Enable us to pass the Crittenden Compromise, and all shall be\r\n     peace and harmony,' they would have succeeded without difficulty.\r\n     It was only through the withdrawal of pro-slavery members that the\r\n     Republicans had achieved an unexpected majority in either House.\r\n     Had those members chosen to return to the seats still awaiting\r\n     them, and to support Mr. Crittenden's proposition, they could have\r\n     carried it without difficulty.\"--Vol. 360, Greeley's Am. Conflict.]\r\n\r\nBut no, they wilfully withdrew their Congressional membership, State by\r\nState, as each Seceded, and refused all terms save those which involved\r\nan absolute surrender to them on all points, including the impossible\r\nclaim of the \"Right of Secession.\"\r\n\r\nLet us now briefly trace the history of the Compromise measures in the\r\ntwo Houses of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Crittenden-Compromise Joint-Resolution had been introduced in the\r\nSenate at the opening of its session and referred to a Select Committee\r\nof Thirteen, and subsequently, January 16th, 1861, having been reported\r\nback, came up in that body for action.  On that day it was amended by\r\ninserting the words \"now held or hereafter to be acquired\" after the\r\nwords \"In all the territory of the United States,\" in the first line of\r\nArticle I., so that it would read as given above.  This amendment--by\r\nwhich not only in all territory then belonging to the United States, but\r\nalso by implication in all that might thereafter be acquired, Slavery\r\nSouth of 36 30' was to be recognized--was agreed to by 29 yeas to 21\r\nnays, as follows:\r\n\r\nYEAS.--Messrs.  Baker, Bayard, Benjamin, Bigler, Bragg, Bright,\r\nClingman, Crittenden, Douglas, Fitch, Green, Gwin, Hemphill, Hunter,\r\nIverson, Johnson of Tennessee, Kennedy, Lane, Mason, Nicholson, Pearce,\r\nPolk, Powell, Pugh, Rice, Saulsbury, Sebastian, Slidell and Wigfall--29.\r\n\r\nNAYS.--Messrs.  Anthony, Bingham, Cameron, Chandler, Clark, Collamer,\r\nDixon, Doolittle, Durkee, Fessenden, Foot, Foster, Grimes, Hale, Harlan,\r\nKing, Latham, Seward, Simmons, Sumner, Ten Eyck, Trumbull, Wade and\r\nWilson--24.\r\n\r\nThe question now recurred upon an amendment, in the nature of a\r\nsubstitute, offered by Mr. Clark, to strike out the preamble of the\r\nCrittenden proposition and all of the resolutions after the word\r\n\"resolved,\" and insert:\r\n\r\n\"That the provisions of the Constitution are ample for the preservation\r\nof the Union, and the protection of all the material interests of the\r\nCountry; that it needs to be obeyed rather than amended; and that an\r\nextrication from our present dangers is to be looked for in strenuous\r\nefforts to preserve the peace, protect the public property, and enforce\r\nthe laws, rather than in new Guarantees for particular interests,\r\nCompromises for particular difficulties, or Concessions to unreasonable\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That all attempts to dissolve the present Union, or overthrow\r\nor abandon the present Constitution, with the hope or expectation of\r\nconstructing a new one, are dangerous, illusory, and destructive; that\r\nin the opinion of the Senate of the United States no such Reconstruction\r\nis practicable; and, therefore, to the maintenance of the existing Union\r\nand Constitution should be directed all the energies of all the\r\ndepartments of the Government, and the efforts of all good citizens.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore reaching a vote on this amendment, Mr. Anthony, (January 16th)\r\nmade a most conciliatory speech, pointing out such practical objections\r\nto the Crittenden proposition as occurred to his mind, and then,\r\ncontinuing, said: \"I believe, Mr. President, that if the danger which\r\nmenaces us is to be avoided at all, it must be by Legislation; which is\r\nmore ready, more certain, and more likely to be satisfactory, than\r\nConstitutional Amendment.  The main difficulty is the Territorial\r\nquestion.  The demand of the Senators on the other side of the Chamber,\r\nand of those whom they represent, is that the territory south of the\r\nline of the Missouri Compromise shall be open to their peculiar\r\nProperty.  All this territory, except the Indian Reservation, is within\r\nthe limits of New Mexico; which, for a part of its northern boundary,\r\nruns up two degrees above that line.  This is now a Slave Territory;\r\nmade so by Territorial Legislation; and Slavery exists there, recognized\r\nand protected.  Now, I am willing, as soon as Kansas can be admitted, to\r\nvote for the admission of New Mexico as a State, with such Constitution\r\nas the People may adopt.  This disposes of all the territory that is\r\nadapted to Slave Labor or that is claimed by the South.  It ought to\r\nsettle the whole question.  Surely if we can dispose of all the\r\nterritory that we have, we ought not to quarrel over that which we have\r\nnot, and which we have no very honest way of acquiring.  Let us settle\r\nthe difficulties that threaten us now, and not anticipate those which\r\nmay never come.  Let the public mind have time to cool * * *.  In\r\noffering to settle this question by the admission of New Mexico, we of\r\nthe North who assent to it propose a great Sacrifice, and offer a large\r\nConcession.\r\n\r\n\"* * *  But we make the offer in a spirit of Compromise and good\r\nfeeling, which we hope will be reciprocated.  * * *  I appeal to\r\nSenators on the other side, when we thus offer to bridge over full\r\nseven-eighths of the frightful chasm that separates us, will you not\r\nbuild the other eighth?  When, with outstretched arms, we approach you\r\nso near that, by reaching out your hands you can clasp ours in the\r\nfraternal grasp from which they should never be separated, will you,\r\nwith folded arms and closed eyes, stand upon extreme demands which you\r\nknow we cannot accept, and for which, if we did, we could not carry our\r\nconstituents?  * * * Together our Fathers achieved the Independence of\r\ntheir Country; together they laid the foundations of its greatness and\r\nits glory; together they constructed this beautiful system under which\r\nit is our privilege to live, which it is our duty to preserve and to\r\ntransmit.  Together we enjoy that privilege; together we must perform\r\nthat duty.  I will not believe that, in the madness of popular folly and\r\ndelusion, the most benignant Government that ever blessed humanity is to\r\nbe broken up.  I will not believe that this great Power which is\r\nmarching with giant steps toward the first place among the Nations of\r\nthe Earth, is to be turned 'backward on its mighty track.'  There are no\r\ngrievances, fancied or real, that cannot be redressed within the Union\r\nand under the Constitution.  There are no differences between us that\r\nmay not be settled if we will take them up in the spirit of those to\r\nwhose places we have succeeded, and the fruits of whose labors we have\r\ninherited.\"\r\n\r\nAnd to this more than fair proposition to the Southerners--to this\r\ntouching appeal in behalf of Peace--what was the response?  Not a word!\r\nIt seemed but to harden their hearts.\r\n\r\n     [Immediately after Mr. Anthony's appeal to the Southern Senators, a\r\n     motion was made by Mr. Collamer to postpone the Crittenden\r\n     Resolutions and take up the Kansas Admission Bill.  Here was the\r\n     chance at once offered to them to respond to that appeal--to make a\r\n     first step, as it were.  They would not make it.  The motion was\r\n     defeated by 25 yeas to 30 nays--Messrs. Benjamin and Slidell of\r\n     Louisiana, Hemphill and Wigfall of Texas, Iverson of Georgia, and\r\n     Johnson of Arkansas, voting \"nay.\"  The question at once recurred\r\n     on the amendment of Mr. Clark--being a substitute for the\r\n     Crittenden Resolutions, declaring in effect all Compromise\r\n     unnecessary.  To let that substitute be adopted, was to insure the\r\n     failure of the Crittenden proposition.  Yet these same six Southern\r\n     Senators though present, refused to vote, and permitted the\r\n     substitute to be adopted by 25 yeas to 23 nays.  The vote of Mr.\r\n     Douglas, who had been \"called out for an instant into the\r\n     ante-room, and deprived of the opportunity of voting \"--as he\r\n     afterwards stated when vainly asking unanimous consent to have his\r\n     vote recorded among the nays-would have made it 25 yeas to 24 nays,\r\n     had he been present and voting, while the votes of the six Southern\r\n     Senators aforesaid, had they voted, would have defeated the\r\n     substitute by 25 yeas to 30 nays.  Then upon a direct vote on the\r\n     Crittenden Compromise there would not only have been the 30 in its\r\n     favor, but the vote of at least one Republican (Baker) in addition,\r\n     to carry it, and, although that would not have given the necessary\r\n     two-thirds, yet it would have been a majority handsome enough to\r\n     have ultimately turned the scales, in both Houses, for a peaceful\r\n     adjustment of the trouble, and have avoided all the sad\r\n     consequences which so speedily befell the Nation.  But this would\r\n     not have suited the Treasonable purposes of the Conspirators.  Ten\r\n     days before this they had probably arranged the Programme in this,\r\n     as well as other matters.  Very certain it is that no time was lost\r\n     by them and their friends in making the best use for their Cause of\r\n     this vote, in the doubtful States of Missouri and North Carolina\r\n     especially.  In the St. Louis journals a Washington dispatch,\r\n     purporting (untruly however) to come from Senators Polk and Green,\r\n     was published to this effect.\r\n\r\n     \"The Crittenden Resolutions were lost by a vote of 25 to 23.  A\r\n     motion of Mr. Cameron to reconsider was lost; and thus ends all\r\n     hope of reconciliation.  Civil War is now considered inevitable,\r\n     and late accounts declare that Fort Sumter will be attacked without\r\n     delay.  The Missouri delegation recommend immediate Secession.\"\r\n\r\n     This is but a sample of other similar dispatches sent elsewhere.\r\n     And the following dispatch, signed by Mr. Crittenden, and published\r\n     in the Raleigh, N.  C., Register, to quiet the excitement raised by\r\n     the telegrams of the Conspirators, serves also to indicate that the\r\n     friends of Compromise were not disheartened by their defeat:\r\n\r\n                    \"WASHINGTON, Jan.  17th, 9 P. M.\r\n\r\n     \"In reply the vote against my resolutions will be reconsidered.\r\n     Their failure was the result of the refusal of six Southern\r\n     Senators to vote.  There is yet good hope of success.\r\n\r\n                    \"JOHN J. CRITTENDEN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     There is instruction also to be drawn from the speeches of Senators\r\n     Saulsbury, and Johnson of Tennessee, made fully a year afterward\r\n     (Jan. 29-31, 1862) in the Senate, touching the defeat of the\r\n     Crittenden Compromise by the Clark substitute at this time.\r\n     Speaking of the second session of the Thirty-sixth Congress, Mr.\r\n     Saulsbury said:\r\n\r\n     \"At that session, while vainly striving with others for the\r\n     adoption of those measures, I remarked in my place in the Senate\r\n     that--\r\n\r\n     \"'If any Gibbon should hereafter write the Decline and Fall of the\r\n     American Republic, he would date its fall from the rejection by the\r\n     Senate of the propositions submitted by the Senator from Kentucky.'\r\n\r\n     \"I believed so then, and I believe so now.  I never shall forget,\r\n     Mr. President, how my heart bounded for joy when I thought I saw a\r\n     ray of hope for their adoption in the fact that a Republican\r\n     Senator now on this floor came to me and requested that I should\r\n     inquire of Mr. Toombs, who was on the eve of his departure for\r\n     Georgia to take a seat in the Convention of that State which was to\r\n     determine the momentous question whether she should continue a\r\n     member of the Union or withdraw from it, whether, if the Crittenden\r\n     propositions were adopted, Georgia would remain in the Union.\r\n\r\n     \"Said Mr. Toombs:\r\n\r\n     \"'Tell him frankly for me that if those resolutions are adopted by\r\n     the vote of any respectable number of Republican Senators,\r\n     evidencing their good faith to advocate their ratification by their\r\n     people, Georgia will not Secede.  This is the position I assumed\r\n     before the people of Georgia.  I told them that if the party in\r\n     power gave evidence of an intention to preserve our rights in the\r\n     Union, we were bound to wait until their people could act.'\r\n\r\n     \"I communicated the answer.  The Substitute of the Senator from New\r\n     Hampshire [Mr. Clark] was subsequently adopted, and from that day\r\n     to this the darkness and the tempest and the storm have thickened,\r\n     until thousands like myself, as good and as true Union men as you,\r\n     Sir, though you may question our motives, have not only despaired\r\n     but are without hope in the future.\"\r\n\r\n     To this speech, Mr. Johnson of Tennessee subsequently replied as\r\n     follows in the United States Senate (Jan.  31, 1862)\r\n\r\n     \"Sir, it has been said by the distinguished Senator from Delaware\r\n     [Mr. Saulsbury] that the questions of controversy might all have\r\n     been settled by Compromise.  He dealt rather extensively in the\r\n     Party aspect of the case, and seemingly desired to throw the onus\r\n     of the present condition of affairs entirely on one side.  He told\r\n     us that, if so and so had been done, these questions could have\r\n     been settled, and that now there would have been no War.  He\r\n     referred particularly to the resolution offered during the last\r\n     Congress by the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Clark], and upon\r\n     the vote on that he based his argument.  * * *  The Senator told us\r\n     that the adoption of the Clark amendment to the Crittenden\r\n     Resolutions defeated the settlement of the questions of\r\n     controversy; and that, but for that vote, all could have been peace\r\n     and prosperity now.  We were told that the Clark amendment defeated\r\n     the Crittenden Compromise, and prevented a settlement of the\r\n     controversy.  On this point I will read a portion of the speech of\r\n     my worthy and talented friend from California [Mr. Latham]; and\r\n     when I speak of him thus, I do it in no unmeaning sense I intend\r\n     that he, not I, shall answer the Senator from Delaware.  * * *  As\r\n     I have said, the Senator from Delaware told us that the Clark\r\n     amendment was the turning point in the whole matter; that from it\r\n     had flowed Rebellion, Revolution, War, the shooting and\r\n     imprisonment of people in different States--perhaps he meant to\r\n     include my own.  This was the Pandora's box that has been opened,\r\n     out of which all the evils that now afflict the Land have flown.  *\r\n     * *  My worthy friend from California [Mr. Latham], during the last\r\n     session of Congress, made one of the best speeches he ever made.  *\r\n     * * In the course of that speech, upon this very point he made use\r\n     of these remarks:\r\n\r\n     \"'Mr. President, being last winter a careful eye-witness of all\r\n     that occurred, I soon became satisfied that it was a deliberate,\r\n     wilful design, on the part of some representatives of Southern\r\n     States, to seize upon the election of Mr. Lincoln merely as an\r\n     excuse to precipitate this revolution upon the Country.  One\r\n     evidence, to my mind, is the fact that South Carolina never sent\r\n     her Senators here.'\r\n\r\n     \"Then they certainly were not influenced by the Clark amendment.\r\n\r\n     \"'An additional evidence is, that when gentlemen on this floor, by\r\n     their votes, could have controlled legislation, they refused to\r\n     cast them for fear that the very Propositions submitted to this\r\n     body might have an influence in changing the opinions of their\r\n     constituencies.  Why, Sir, when the resolutions submitted by the\r\n     Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Clark], were offered as an\r\n     amendment to the Crittenden Propositions, for the manifest purpose\r\n     of embarrassing the latter, and the vote taken on the 16th of\r\n     January, 1861, I ask, what did we see?  There were fifty-five\r\n     Senators at that time upon this floor, in person.  The Globe of the\r\n     second Session, Thirty-Sixth Congress, Part I., page 409, shows\r\n     that upon the call of the yeas and nays immediately preceding the\r\n     vote on the substituting of Mr. Clark's amendment, there were\r\n     fifty-five votes cast.

Why not save this\r\n     Proposition, and see if we cannot bring the Country to it?'  He\r\n     gave me rather an abrupt answer, and said he would control his own\r\n     action without consulting me or anybody else.  Said I: 'Vote, and\r\n     show yourself an honest man.'  As soon as the vote was taken, he\r\n     and others telegraphed South, 'We cannot get any Compromise.'  Here\r\n     were six Southern men refusing to vote, when the amendment would\r\n     have been rejected by four majority if they had voted.  Who, then,\r\n     has brought these evils on the Country?  Was it Mr. Clark?  He was\r\n     acting out his own policy; but with the help we had from the other\r\n     side of the chamber, if all those on this side had been true to the\r\n     Constitution and faithful to their constituents, and had acted with\r\n     fidelity to the Country, the amendment of the Senator from New\r\n     Hampshire could have been voted down, the defeat of which the\r\n     Senator from Delaware says would have saved the Country.  Whose\r\n     fault was it?  Who is responsible for it?  * * *  Who did it?\r\n     SOUTHERN TRAITORS, as was said in the speech of the Senator from\r\n     California.  They did it.  They wanted no Compromise.  They\r\n     accomplished their object by withholding their votes; and hence the\r\n     Country has been involved in the present difficulty.  Let me read\r\n     another extract from this speech of the Senator from California\r\n\r\n     \"'I recollect full well the joy that pervaded the faces of some of\r\n     those gentlemen at the result, and the sorrow manifested by the\r\n     venerable Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Crittenden].  The record shows\r\n     that Mr. Pugh, from Ohio, despairing of any Compromise between the\r\n     extremes of ultra Republicanism and Disunionists, working\r\n     manifestly for the same end, moved, immediately after the vote was\r\n     announced, to lay the whole subject on the table.  If you will turn\r\n     to page 443, same volume, you will find, when, at a late period,\r\n     Mr. Cameron, from Pennsylvania, moved to reconsider the vote,\r\n     appeals having been made to sustain those who were struggling to\r\n     preserve the Peace of the Country, that the vote was reconsidered;\r\n     and when, at last, the Crittenden Propositions were submitted on\r\n     the 2d day of March, these Southern States having 'nearly all\r\n     Seceded, they were then lost but by one vote.  Here is the vote:\r\n\r\n     \"YEAS-Messrs.  Bayard, Bigler, Bright, Crittenden, Douglas, Gwin,\r\n     Hunter, Johnson of Tennessee, Kennedy, Lane, Latham, Mason,\r\n     Nicholson, Polk, Pugh, Rice, Sebastian, Thomson and Wigfall--19.\r\n\r\n     \"'NAYS-Messrs.

The Crittenden Proposition\r\n     would have been indorsed by a majority vote, the subject finally\r\n     going before the People, who have never yet, after consideration,\r\n     refused Justice, for any length of time, to any portion of the\r\n     Country.\r\n\r\n     \"'I believe more, Mr. President, that these gentlemen were acting\r\n     in pursuance of a settled and fixed plan to break up and destroy\r\n     this Government.'\r\n\r\n     \"When we had it in our power to vote down the amendment of the\r\n     Senator from New Hampshire, and adopt the Crittenden Resolutions,\r\n     certain Southern Senators prevented it; and yet, even at a late day\r\n     of the session, after they had Seceded, the Crittenden Proposition\r\n     was only lost by one vote.  If Rebellion and bloodshed and murder\r\n     have followed, to whose skirts does the responsibility attach?\r\n\r\n     \"What else was done at the very same session?  The House of\r\n     Representatives passed, and sent to this body, a Proposition to\r\n     amend the Constitution of the United States, so as to prohibit\r\n     Congress from ever hereafter interfering with the Institution of\r\n     Slavery in the States, making that restriction a part of the\r\n     Organic law of the Land.  That Constitutional Amendment came here\r\n     after the Senators from seven States had Seceded; and yet it was\r\n     passed by a two-third vote in the Senate.  Have you ever heard of\r\n     any one of the States which had then Seceded, or which has since\r\n     Seceded, taking up that Amendment to the Constitution, and saying\r\n     they would ratify it, and make it a part of that instrument?  No.\r\n     Does not the whole history of this Rebellion tell you that it was\r\n     Revolution that the Leaders wanted, that they started for, that\r\n     they intended to have?  The facts to which I have referred show how\r\n     the Crittenden Proposition might have been carried; and when the\r\n     Senators from the Slave States were reduced to one-fourth of the\r\n     members of this body, the two Houses passed a Proposition to Amend\r\n     the Constitution, so as to guarantee to the States perfect security\r\n     in regard to the Institution of Slavery in all future time, and\r\n     prohibiting Congress from legislating on the subject.\r\n\r\n     \"But what more was done?  After Southern Senators had treacherously\r\n     abandoned the Constitution and deserted their posts here, Congress\r\n     passed Bills for the Organization of three new Territories: Dakota,\r\n     Nevada, and Colorado; and in the sixth section of each of those\r\n     Bills, after conferring, affirmatively, power on the Territorial\r\n     Legislature, it went on to exclude certain powers by using a\r\n     negative form of expression; and it provided, among other things,\r\n     that the Legislature should have no power to legislate so as to\r\n     impair the right to private property; that it should lay no tax\r\n     discriminating against one description of Property in favor of\r\n     another; leaving the power on all these questions, not in the\r\n     Territorial Legislature, but in the People when they should come to\r\n     form a State Constitution.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, I ask, taking the Amendment to the Constitution, and taking\r\n     the three Territorial Bills, embracing every square inch of\r\n     territory in the possession of the United States, how much of the\r\n     Slavery question was left?  What better Compromise could have been\r\n     made?  Still we are told that matters might have been Compromised,\r\n     and that if we had agreed to Compromise, bloody Rebellion would not\r\n     now be abroad in the Land.  Sir, Southern Senators are responsible\r\n     for it.  They stood here with power to accomplish the result, and\r\n     yet treacherously, and, I may say, tauntingly they left this\r\n     chamber, and announced that they had dissolved their connection\r\n     with the Government.  Then, when we were left in the hands of those\r\n     whom we had been taught to believe would encroach upon our Rights,\r\n     they gave us, in the Constitutional Amendment and in the three\r\n     Territorial Bills, all that had ever been asked; and yet gentlemen\r\n     talked Compromise!\r\n\r\n     \"Why was not this taken and accepted?  No; it was not Compromise\r\n     that the Leaders wanted; they wanted Power; they wanted to Destroy\r\n     this Government, so that they might have place and emolument for\r\n     themselves.  They had lost confidence in the intelligence and\r\n     virtue and integrity of the People, and their capacity to govern\r\n     themselves; and they intended to separate and form a government,\r\n     the chief corner-stone of which should be Slavery, disfranchising\r\n     the great mass of the People, of which we have seen constant\r\n     evidence, and merging the Powers of Government in the hands of the\r\n     Few.  I know what I say.  I know their feelings and their\r\n     sentiments.  I served in the Senate here with them.  I know they\r\n     were a Close Corporation, that had no more confidence in or respect\r\n     for the People than has the Dey of Algiers.  I fought that Close\r\n     Corporation here.  I knew that they were no friends of the People.\r\n     I knew that Slidell and Mason and Benjamin and Iverson and Toombs\r\n     were the enemies of Free Government, and I know so now.  I\r\n     commenced the war upon them before a State Seceded; and I intend to\r\n     keep on fighting this great battle before the Country, for the\r\n     perpetuity of Free Government.  They seek to overthrow it, and to\r\n     establish a Despotism in its place.  That is the great battle which\r\n     is upon our hands.  * * *  Now, the Senator from Delaware tells us\r\n     that if that (Crittenden) Compromise had been made, all these\r\n     consequences would have been avoided.  It is a mere pretense; it is\r\n     false.  Their object was to overturn the Government.  If they could\r\n     not get the Control of this Government, they were willing to divide\r\n     the Country and govern part of it.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Clark substitute was then agreed to, by 25 (Republican) yeas to 23\r\nDemocratic and Conservative (Bell-Everett) nays--6 Pro-Slavery Senators\r\nnot voting, although present; and then, without division, the Crittenden\r\nResolutions were tabled--Mr. Cameron, however, entering a motion to\r\nreconsider.  Subsequently the action of the Senate, both on the\r\nResolutions and Substitute, was reconsidered, and March 2d the matter\r\ncame up again, as will hereafter appear.\r\n\r\nTwo days prior to this action in the Senate, Mr. Corwin, Chairman of the\r\nSelect Committee of Thirty-three, reported to the House (January 14th),\r\nfrom a majority of that Committee, the following Joint Resolution:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled, That all attempts on the parts\r\nof the Legislatures of any of the States to obstruct or hinder the\r\nrecovery and surrender of Fugitives from Service or Labor, are in\r\nderogation of the Constitution of the United States, inconsistent with\r\nthe comity and good neighborhood that should prevail among the several\r\nStates, and dangerous to the Peace of the Union.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the several States be respectfully requested to cause\r\ntheir Statutes to be revised, with a view to ascertain if any of them\r\nare in conflict with or tend to embarrass or hinder the execution of the\r\nLaws of the United States, made in pursuance of the second section of\r\nthe Fourth Article of the Constitution of the United States for the\r\ndelivery up of Persons held to Labor by the laws of any State and\r\nescaping therefrom; and the Senate and House of Representatives\r\nearnestly request that all enactments having such tendency be forthwith\r\nrepealed, as required by a just sense of Constitutional obligations, and\r\nby a due regard for the Peace of the Republic; and the President of the\r\nUnited States is requested to communicate these resolutions to the\r\nGovernors of the several States, with a request that they will lay the\r\nsame before the Legislatures thereof respectively.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That we recognize Slavery as now existing in fifteen of the\r\nUnited States by the usages and laws of those States; and we recognize\r\nno authority, legally or otherwise, outside of a State where it so\r\nexists, to interfere with Slaves or Slavery in such States, in disregard\r\nof the Rights of their owners or the Peace of society.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That we recognize the justice and propriety of a faithful\r\nexecution of the Constitution, and laws made in pursuance thereof, on\r\nthe subject of Fugitive Slaves, or Fugitives from Service or Labor, and\r\ndiscountenance all mobs or hindrances to the execution of such laws, and\r\nthat citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and\r\nimmunities of citizens in the several States.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That we recognize no such conflicting elements in its\r\ncomposition, or sufficient cause from any source, for a dissolution of\r\nthis Government; that we were not sent here to destroy, but to sustain\r\nand harmonize the Institutions of the Country, and to see that equal\r\njustice is done to all parts of the same; and finally, to perpetuate its\r\nexistence on terms of equality and justice to all the States.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That a faithful observance, on the part of all the States, of\r\nall their Constitutional obligations to each other and to the Federal\r\nGovernment, is essential to the Peace of the Country.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That it is the duty of the Federal Government to enforce the\r\nFederal Laws, protect the Federal property, and preserve the Union of\r\nthese States.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That each State be requested to revise its Statutes, and, if\r\nnecessary, so to amend the same as to secure, without Legislation by\r\nCongress, to citizens of other States traveling therein, the same\r\nprotection as citizens of such States enjoy; and also to protect the\r\ncitizens of other States traveling or sojourning therein against popular\r\nviolence or illegal summary punishment, without trial in due form of\r\nlaw, for imputed crimes.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That each State be also respectfully requested to enact such\r\nlaws as will prevent and punish any attempt whatever in such State to\r\nrecognize or set on foot the lawless invasion of any other State or\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the President be requested to transmit copies of the\r\nforegoing resolutions to the Governors of the several States, with a\r\nrequest that they be communicated to their respective Legislatures.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Joint Resolution, with amendments proposed to the same, came up in\r\nthe House for action, on the 27th of February, 1861--the same day upon\r\nwhich the Peace Congress or Conference concluded its labors at\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nThe Proposition of Mr. Burch, of California, was the first acted upon.\r\nIt was to amend the Select Committee's resolutions, as above given, by\r\nadding to them another resolution at the end thereof, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, etc., That it be, and is hereby, recommended to the several\r\nStates of the Union that they, through their respective Legislatures,\r\nrequest the Congress of the United States to call a Convention of all\r\nthe States, in accordance with Article Fifth of the Constitution, for\r\nthe purpose of amending said Constitution in such manner and with regard\r\nto such subjects as will more adequately respond to the wants, and\r\nafford more sufficient Guarantees to the diversified and growing\r\nInterests of the Government and of the People composing the same.\"\r\n\r\nThis (Burch) amendment, however, was defeated by 14 yeas to 109 nays.\r\n\r\nA Proposition of Mr. Kellogg, of Illinois, came up next for action.  It\r\nwas a motion to strike out all after the first word \"That\" in the\r\nCrittenden Proposition--which had been offered by Mr. Clemens as a\r\nsubstitute for the Committee Resolutions--and insert the following:\r\n\r\n\"The following articles be, and are hereby, proposed and submitted as\r\nAmendments to the Constitution of the United States, which shall be\r\nvalid, to all intents and purposes as part of said Constitution, when\r\nratified by Conventions of three-fourths of the several States.\r\n\r\n\"Article XIII.  That in all the territory now held by the United States\r\nsituate north of latitude 36  30' Involuntary Servitude, except in the\r\npunishment for crime, is prohibited while such territory shall remain\r\nunder a Territorial government; that in all the territory now held south\r\nof said line, neither Congress nor any Territorial Legislature shall\r\nhinder or prevent the emigration to said territory of Persons; held to\r\nService from any State of this Union, when that relation exists by\r\nvirtue of any law or usage of such State, while it shall remain in a\r\nTerritorial condition; and when any Territory north or south of said\r\nline, within such boundaries as Congress may prescribe, shall contain\r\nthe population requisite for a member of Congress, according to the then\r\nFederal ratio of representation of the People of the United States, it\r\nmay, if its form of government be Republican, be admitted into the Union\r\non an equal footing with the original States, with or without the\r\nrelation of Persons held to Service and Labor, as the Constitution of\r\nsuch new State may provide.\r\n\r\n\"Article XIV.  That nothing in the Constitution of the United States, or\r\nany amendment thereto, shall be so construed as to authorize any\r\nDepartment of the Government to in any manner interfere with the\r\nrelation of Persons held to Service in any State where that relation\r\nexists, nor in any manner to establish or sustain that relation in any\r\nState where it is prohibited by the Laws or Constitution of such State.\r\nAnd that this Article shall not be altered or amended without the\r\nconsent of every State in the Union.\r\n\r\n\"Article XV.  The third paragraph of the second section of the Fourth\r\nArticle of the Constitution shall be taken and construed to authorize\r\nand empower Congress to pass laws necessary to secure the return of\r\nPersons held to Service or Labor under the laws of any State, who may\r\nhave escaped therefrom, to the party to whom such Service or Labor may\r\nbe due.\r\n\r\n\"Article XVI.  The migration or importation of Persons held to Service\r\nor Involuntary Servitude, into any State, Territory, or place within the\r\nUnited States, from any place or country beyond the limits of the United\r\nStates or Territories thereof, is forever prohibited.\r\n\r\n\"Article XVII.  No territory beyond the present limits of the United\r\nStates and the Territories thereof, shall be annexed to or be acquired\r\nby the United States, unless by treaty, which treaty shall be ratified\r\nby a vote of two-thirds of the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nThe Kellogg Proposition was defeated by 33 yeas to 158\r\nnays.\r\n\r\nThe Clemens Substitute was next voted on.  This embraced the whole of\r\nthe Crittenden Compromise Proposition, as amended in the Senate by\r\ninserting the provision as to all territory \"hereafter acquired,\" with\r\nthe addition of another proposed Article of Amendment to the\r\nConstitution, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Article VII.  Section I.  The elective franchise and the Right to hold\r\noffice, whether Federal, State, Territorial, or Municipal, shall not be\r\nexercised by Persons who are, in whole or in part, of the African Race.\r\n\r\n\"Section II.  The United States shall have power to acquire from time to\r\ntime districts of country in Africa and South America, for the\r\ncolonization, at expense of the Federal Treasury, of such Free Negroes\r\nand Mulattoes as the several States may wish to have removed from their\r\nlimits, and from the District of Columbia, and such other places as may\r\nbe under the jurisdiction of Congress.\"\r\n\r\nThe Clemens Substitute (or Crittenden Measure, with the addition of said\r\nproposed Article VII.), was defeated by 80 yeas to 113 nays, and then\r\nthe Joint Resolution of the Select Committee as heretofore given--after\r\na vain attempt to table it--was passed by 136 yeas to 53 nays.\r\n\r\nImmediately after this action, a Joint Resolution to amend the\r\nConstitution of the United States, which had also been previously\r\nreported by the Select Committee of Thirty-three, came before the House,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"Be it Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled, (two-thirds of both Houses\r\nconcurring), That the following Article be proposed to the Legislatures\r\nof the several States as an Amendment to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, which, when ratified by three-fourths of said Legislatures,\r\nshall be valid, to all intents and purposes, as a part of the said\r\nConstitution, namely:\r\n\r\n\"Article XII.  No amendment of this Constitution having for its object\r\nany interference within the States with the relation between their\r\ncitizens and those described in Section II. of the First Article of the\r\nConstitution as 'all other persons,' shall originate with any State that\r\ndoes not recognize that relation within its own limits, or shall be\r\nvalid without the assent of every one of the States composing the\r\nUnion.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Corwin submitted an Amendment striking out all the words after\r\n\"namely;\" and inserting the following:\r\n\r\n\"Article XII.  No amendment shall be made to the Constitution which will\r\nauthorize or give to Congress the power to abolish or interfere, within\r\nany State, with the Domestic Institutions thereof, including that of\r\nPersons held to Labor or Service by the laws of said State.\"\r\n\r\nAmid scenes of great disorder, the Corwin Amendment was adopted by 120\r\nyeas to 61 nays, and then the Joint Resolution as amended, was defeated\r\n(two-thirds not voting in the affirmative) by 123 yeas to 71 nays.  On\r\nthe following day (February 28th), amid still greater confusion and\r\ndisorder, which the Speaker, despite frequent efforts, was unable to\r\nquell, that vote was reconsidered, and the Joint Resolution passed by\r\n133 yeas to 65 nays--a result which, when announced was received with\r\n\"loud and prolonged applause, both on the floor, and in the galleries.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of March, the House Joint Resolution just given, proposing an\r\nAmendment to the Constitution, prohibiting Congress from touching\r\nSlavery within any State where it exists, came up in the Senate for\r\naction.\r\n\r\nMr. Pugh moved to substitute for it the Crittenden Proposition.\r\n\r\nMr. Doolittle moved to amend the proposed substitute (the Crittenden\r\nProposition), by the insertion of the following, as an additional\r\nArticle:\r\n\r\n\"Under this Constitution, as originally adopted, and as it now exists,\r\nno State has power to withdraw from the jurisdiction of the United\r\nStates; but this Constitution, and all laws passed in pursuance of its\r\ndelegated powers, are the Supreme Law of the Land, anything contained in\r\nany Constitution, Ordinance, or Act of any State, to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Doolittle's amendment was lost by 18 yeas to 28 nays.\r\n\r\nMr. Pugh's substitute (the Crittenden Proposition), was lost by 14 yeas\r\nto 25 nays.\r\n\r\nMr. Bingham moved to amend the House Joint Resolution, by striking out\r\nall after the word \"resolved,\" and inserting the words of the Clark\r\nProposition as heretofore given, but the amendment was rejected by 13\r\nyeas to 25 nays.\r\n\r\nMr. Grimes moved to strike out all after the word \"whereas\" in the\r\npreamble of the House Joint Resolution, and insert the following:\r\n\r\n\"The Legislatures of the States of Kentucky, New Jersey, and Illinois\r\nhave applied to Congress to call a Convention for proposing Amendments\r\nto the Constitution of the United States: Therefore,\r\n\r\n\"Be it Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled, That the Legislatures of the\r\nother States be invited to take the subject of such a Convention into\r\nconsideration, and to express their will on that subject to Congress, in\r\npursuance of the Fifth Article of the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nThis amendment was also rejected, by 14 yeas to 25 nays.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson, of Arkansas, offered, as an amendment to the House Joint\r\nResolution, the propositions submitted by the Peace Congress or\r\nConference, but the amendment was disagreed to by 3 yeas to 34 nays.\r\n\r\nThe House Joint Resolution was then adopted by 24 yeas to 12 nays.\r\n\r\nSubsequently the Crittenden Proposition came up again as a separate\r\norder, with the Clark substitute to it (once carried, but reconsidered),\r\npending.  The Clark substitute was then rejected by 14 yeas to 22 nays.\r\n\r\nMr. Crittenden then offered the Propositions of the Peace\r\nCongress, as a substitute for his own-and they were rejected by 7 yeas\r\nto 28 nays.\r\n\r\nThe Crittenden Proposition itself was then rejected, by\r\n19 yeas to 20 nays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                 SLAVERY'S SETTING, AND FREEDOM'S DAWN.\r\n\r\nOn that long last night of the 36th Congress--and of the Democratic\r\nAdministration--to the proceedings of which reference was made in the\r\npreceding Chapter, several notable speeches were made, but there was\r\nsubstantially nothing done, in the line of Compromise.  The only thing\r\nthat had been accomplished was the passage, as we have seen, by\r\ntwo-thirds majority in both Houses, of the Joint Resolution proposing a\r\nConstitutional Amendment prohibiting Congress from meddling with Slavery\r\nin Slave States.  There was no Concession nor Compromise in this,\r\nbecause Republicans, as well as Democrats, had always held that Congress\r\nhad no such power.  It is true that the Pro-slavery men had charged the\r\nRepublicans with ultimate designs, through Congress, upon Slavery in the\r\nSlave States; and Mr. Crittenden pleaded for its passage as exhibiting a\r\nspirit, on their part, of reconciliation; that was all.\r\n\r\nIn his speech that night--that memorable and anxious night preceding the\r\nInauguration of President Lincoln--the venerable Mr. Crittenden,\r\nspeaking before the Resolution was agreed to, well sketched the\r\nsituation when he said in the Senate: \"It is an admitted fact that our\r\nUnion, to some extent, has already been dismembered; and that further\r\ndismemberment is impending and threatened.  It is a fact that the\r\nCountry is in danger.  This is admitted on all hands.  It is our duty,\r\nif we can, to provide a remedy for this.  We are, under the Constitution\r\nand by the election of the People, the great guardians, as well as the\r\nadministrators of this Government.  To our wisdom they have trusted this\r\ngreat chart.  Remedies have been proposed; resolutions have been\r\noffered, proposing for adoption measures which it was thought would\r\nsatisfy the Country, and preserve as much of the Union as remained to us\r\nat least, if they were not enough at once to recall the Seceding States\r\nto the Union.  We have passed none of these measures.  The differences\r\nof opinion among Senators have been such that we have not been able to\r\nconcur in any of the measures which have been proposed, even by bare\r\nmajorities, much less by that two-thirds majority which is necessary to\r\ncarry into effect some of the pacific measures which have been proposed.\r\nWe are about to adjourn.  We have done nothing.  Even the Senate of the\r\nUnited States, beholding this great ruin around them, beholding\r\nDismemberment and Revolution going on, and Civil War threatened as the\r\nresult, have been able to do nothing; we have absolutely done nothing.\r\nSir, is not this a remarkable spectacle?  * * * How does it happen that\r\nnot even a bare majority here, when the Country trusted to our hands is\r\ngoing to ruin, have been competent to devise any measure of public\r\nsafety?  How does it happen that we have not had unanimity enough to\r\nagree on any measure of that kind?  Can we account for it to ourselves,\r\ngentlemen?  We see the danger; we acknowledge our duty, and yet, with\r\nall this before us, we are acknowledging before the world that we can do\r\nnothing; acknowledging before the world, or appearing to all the world,\r\nas men who do nothing!  Sir, this will make a strange record in the\r\nhistory of Governments and in the history of the world.  Some are for\r\nCoercion; yet no army has been raised, no navy has been equipped.  Some\r\nare for pacification; yet they have been able to do nothing; the dissent\r\nof their colleagues prevents them; and here we are in the midst of a\r\nfalling Country, in the midst of a falling State, presenting to the eyes\r\nof the World the saddest spectacle it has ever seen.  Cato is\r\nrepresented by Addison as a worthy spectacle, 'a great man falling with\r\na falling State,' but he fell struggling.  We fall with the ignominy on\r\nour heads of doing nothing, like the man who stands by and sees his\r\nhouse in flames, and says to himself, 'perhaps the fire will stop before\r\nit consumes all.'\"\r\n\r\nOne of the strong pleas made in the Senate that night, was by Mr.\r\nDouglas, when he said: \"The great issue with the South has been that\r\nthey would not submit to the Wilmot proviso.  The Republican Party\r\naffirmed the doctrine that Congress must and could prohibit Slavery in\r\nthe Territories.  The issue for ten years was between Non-intervention\r\non the part of Congress, and prohibition by Congress.  Up to two years\r\nago, neither the Senator (Mason) from Virginia, nor any other Southern\r\nSenator, desired affirmative legislation to protect Slavery.  Even up to\r\nthis day, not one of them has proposed affirmative legislation to\r\nprotect it.  Whenever the question has come up, they have decided that\r\naffirmative legislation to protect it was unnecessary; and hence, all\r\nthat the South required on the Territorial question was 'hands off;\r\nSlavery shall not be prohibited by Act of Congress.' Now, what do we\r\nfind?  This very session, in view of the perils which surround the\r\nCountry, the Republican Party, in both Houses of Congress, by a\r\nunanimous vote, have backed down from their platform and abandoned the\r\ndoctrine of Congressional prohibition.  This very week three Territorial\r\nBills have been passed through both Houses of Congress without the\r\nWilmot proviso, and no man proposed to enact it; not even one man on the\r\nother side of the Chamber would rise and propose the Wilmot proviso.\"\r\n\r\n\"In organizing three Territories,\" continued he, \"two of them South of\r\nthe very line where they imposed the Wilmot proviso twelve years ago, no\r\none on the other side of the Chamber proposed it.  They have abandoned\r\nthe doctrine of the President-elect upon that point.  He said, and it is\r\non record, that he had voted for the Wilmot proviso forty-two times, and\r\nwould do it forty-two times more if he ever had a chance.  Not one of\r\nhis followers this year voted for it once.  The Senator from New York\r\n(Mr. Seward) the embodiment of the Party, sat quietly and did not\r\npropose it.  What more?  Last year we were told that the Slave Code of\r\nNew Mexico was to be repealed.  I denounced the attempted interference.\r\nThe House of Representatives passed the Bill, but the Bill remains on\r\nyour table; no one Republican member has proposed to take it up and pass\r\nit.  Practically, therefore, the Chicago platform is abandoned; the\r\nPhiladelphia platform is abandoned; the whole doctrine for which the\r\nRepublican Party contended, as to the Territories, is abandoned,\r\nsurrendered, given up.  Non-intervention is substituted in its place.\r\nThen, when we find that, on the Territorial question, the Republican\r\nParty, by a unanimous vote, have surrendered to the South all they ask,\r\nthe Territorial question ought to be considered pretty well settled.\r\nThe only question left was that of the States; and after having\r\nabandoned their aggressive policy as to the Territories, a portion of\r\nthem are willing to unite with us, and deprive themselves of the power\r\nto do it in the States.\"\r\n\r\n\"I submit,\" said he, \"that these two great facts--these startling,\r\ntremendous facts--that they have abandoned their aggressive policy in\r\nthe Territories, and are willing to give guarantees in the States, ought\r\nto be accepted as an evidence of a salutary change in Public Opinion at\r\nthe North.  All I would ask now of the Republican Party is, that they\r\nwould insert in the Constitution the same principle that they have\r\ncarried out practically in the Territorial Bills for Colorado, Dakota,\r\nand Nevada, by depriving Congress of the power hereafter to do what\r\nthere cannot be a man of them found willing to do this year; but we\r\ncannot ask them to back down too much.  I think they have done quite as\r\nmuch within one year, within three months after they have elected a\r\nPresident, as could be expected.\"\r\n\r\nThat Douglas and his followers were also patriotically willing to\r\nsacrifice a favorite theory in the face of a National peril, was brought\r\nout, at the same time, by Mr. Baker, when he said to Mr. Douglas: \"I\r\ndesire to suggest (and being a little of a Popular Sovereignty man, it\r\ncomes gracefully from me) that others of us have backed down too, from\r\nthe idea that Congress has not the power to prohibit Slavery in the\r\nTerritories; and we are proposing some of us in the Crittenden\r\nproposition, and some in the Amendment now before the Senate--to\r\nprohibit Slavery by the Constitution itself, in the Territories;\"--and\r\nby Mr. Douglas, when he replied: \"I think as circumstances change, the\r\naction of public men ought to change in a corresponding degree.  * * * I\r\nam willing to depart from my cherished theory, by an Amendment to the\r\nConstitution by which we shall settle this question on the principles\r\nprescribed in the Resolutions of the Senator from Kentucky.\"\r\n\r\n     In the House, Mr. Logan, had, on the 5th of February, 1861, said:\r\n\r\n     \"Men, Sir, North and South, who love themselves far better than\r\n     their Country, have brought us to this unhappy condition.  * * *\r\n     Let me say to gentlemen, that I will go as far as any man in the\r\n     performance of a Constitutional duty to put down Rebellion, to\r\n     suppress Insurrection, and to enforce the laws; but when we\r\n     undertake the performance of these duties, let us act in such a\r\n     manner as will be best calculated to preserve and not destroy the\r\n     Government, and keep ourselves within the bounds of the\r\n     Constitution.  * * *  Sir, I have always denied, and do yet deny,\r\n     the Right of Secession.  There is no warrant for it in the\r\n     Constitution.  It is wrong, it is unlawful, unconstitutional, and\r\n     should be called by the right name, Revolution.  No good, Sir, can\r\n     result from it, but much mischief may.  It is no remedy for any\r\n     grievance.\r\n\r\n     \"I hold that all grievances can be much easier redressed inside the\r\n     Union than out of it.  * * *  If a collision must ensue between\r\n     this Government and any of our own people, let it come when every\r\n     other means of settlement has been tried and exhausted; and not\r\n     then, except when the Government shall be compelled to repel\r\n     assaults for the protection of its property, flag, and the honor of\r\n     the Country.  * * *\r\n\r\n     \"I have been taught to believe that the preservation of this\r\n     glorious Union, with its broad flag waving over us, as the shield\r\n     for our protection on land and on sea, is paramount to all the\r\n     Parties and platforms that ever have existed, or ever can exist.  I\r\n     would, to-day, if I had the power, sink my own Party, and every\r\n     other one, with all their platforms, into the vortex of ruin,\r\n     without heaving a sigh or shedding a tear, to save the Union, or\r\n     even stop the Revolution where it is.\"\r\n\r\n     After enumerating the various propositions for adjustment, then\r\n     pending in the House, to wit: that of Senator Crittenden; that of\r\n     Senator Douglas; that of the Committee of Thirty-three; that of the\r\n     Border States; and those of Representatives McClernand, Kellogg,\r\n     and Morris, of Illinois, Mr. Logan took occasion to declare that\r\n     \"in a crisis like this\" he was \"willing to give his support to any\r\n     of them,\" but his preference was for that of Mr. Morris.\r\n\r\n     Said he: \"He (Morris) proposes that neither Congress nor a\r\n     Territorial Legislature shall interfere with Slavery in the\r\n     Territories at all; but leaves the people, when they come to form\r\n     their State Constitution, to determine the question for themselves.\r\n     I think this is the best proposition, because it is a fair\r\n     concession on all sides.  The Republicans give up their\r\n     Congressional intervention; those who are styled 'Squatter\r\n     Sovereigns' give up their Territorial legislative policy; and the\r\n     Southern (Slave) protectionists give up their protection-\r\n     intervention policy; thus every Party yields something.  With this\r\n     proposition as an Article in the Constitution, it would satisfy\r\n     every conservative man in this Union, both North and South, I do\r\n     seriously and honestly believe.\r\n\r\n     \"Having indicated my preference of these propositions, and my\r\n     reasons for that preference, I have said all I desire to say on the\r\n     point, except to repeat again, that I will willingly vote for any\r\n     of them, or make any other sacrifice necessary to save the Union.\r\n     It makes no kind of difference to me what the sacrifice; if it will\r\n     save my Country, I am ready to make it.\"  * * *\r\n\r\n     \"There are some in this Hall,\" said he, \"that are almost ready to\r\n     strike the Party fetters from their limbs, and assist in measures\r\n     of Peace.  Halt not; take the step; be independent and free at\r\n     once!  Let us overcome Party passion and error; allow virtue and\r\n     good sense in this fateful hour to be triumphant; let us invoke\r\n     Deity to interpose and prepare the way for our Country's escape\r\n     from the perils by which we are now surrounded; and in view of our\r\n     present greatness and future prospects, our magnificent and growing\r\n     cities, our many institutions of learning, our once happy and\r\n     prosperous People, our fruitful fields and golden forests, our\r\n     enjoyment of all civil and religious blessings--let Parties die\r\n     that these be preserved.  Such noble acts of patriotism and\r\n     concession, on your part, would cause posterity to render them\r\n     illustrious, and pause to contemplate the magnitude of the events\r\n     with which they were connected.  * * * In the name of the patriotic\r\n     sires who breasted the storms and vicissitudes of the Revolution;\r\n     by all the kindred ties of this Country; in the name of the many\r\n     battles fought for your Freedom; in behalf of the young and the\r\n     old; in behalf of the Arts and Sciences, Civilization, Peace,\r\n     Order, Christianity, and Humanity, I appeal to you to strike from\r\n     your limbs the chains that bind them!  Come forth from that\r\n     loathsome prison, Party Caucus; and in this hour--the most gloomy\r\n     and disheartening to the lovers of Free Institutions that has ever\r\n     existed during our Country's history--arouse the drooping spirits\r\n     of our countrymen, by putting forth your good strong arms to assist\r\n     in steadying the rocking pillars of the mightiest Republic that has\r\n     ever had an existence.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Speaker,\" continued he, \"a word or two more, and I am done.\r\n     Revolution stalks over the Land.  States have rebelled against the\r\n     constituted authorities of the Union, and now stand, sword in hand,\r\n     prepared to vindicate their new nationality.  Others are preparing\r\n     to take a similar position.  Rapidly transpiring events are\r\n     crowding on us with fearful velocity.  Soon, circumstances may\r\n     force us into an unnatural strife, in which the hand of brother\r\n     shall be uplifted against brother, and father against son.  My God,\r\n     what a spectacle!  If all the evils and calamities that have ever\r\n     happened since the World began, could be gathered in one great\r\n     Catastrophe, its horrors could not eclipse, in their frightful\r\n     proportions, the Drama that impends over us.  Whether this black\r\n     cloud that drapes in mourning the whole political heavens, shall\r\n     break forth in all the frightful intensity of War, and make\r\n     Christendom weep at the terrible atrocities that will be enacted\r\n     --or, whether it will disappear, and the sky resume its wonted\r\n     serenity, and the whole Earth be irradiated by the genial sunshine\r\n     of Peace once more--are the alternatives which this Congress, in my\r\n     judgment, has the power to select between.\"\r\n\r\nIn this same broad spirit, Mr. Seward, in his great speech of January\r\n12th, had said: \"Republicanism is subordinate to Union, as everything\r\nelse is and ought to be--Republicanism, Democracy, every other political\r\nname and thing; all are subordinate-and they ought to disappear in the\r\npresence of the great question of Union.\"  In another part of it, he had\r\neven more emphatically said: \"I therefore * * * avow my adherence to the\r\nUnion in its integrity and with all its parts, with my friends, with my\r\nParty, with my State, with my Country, or without either, as they may\r\ndetermine, in every event, whether of Peace or War, with every\r\nconsequence of honor or dishonor, of life or death.  Although I lament\r\nthe occasion, I hail with cheerfulness the duty of lifting up my voice\r\namong distracted debates, for my whole Country and its inestimable\r\nUnion.\"  And as showing still more clearly the kindly and conciliatory\r\nattitude of the great Republican leader, when speaking of those others\r\nwho seemed to be about to invoke revolutionary action to oppose--and\r\noverthrow the Government--he said: \"In such a case I can afford to meet\r\nprejudice with Conciliation, exaction with Concession which surrenders\r\nno principle, and violence with the right hand of Peace.\"\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives, too, the voice of patriotism was often\r\nheard through the loud clamor and disorder of that most disorderly and\r\nTreason-uttering session--was heard from the lips of statesmen, who rose\r\nhigh above Party, in their devotion to the Union.  The calm,\r\ndispassionate recital by Henry Winter Davis (of Maryland), of the\r\nsuccessive steps by which the Southern leaders had themselves created\r\nthat very \"North\" of whose antagonism they complained, was one of the\r\nbest of these, in some respects.  He was one of the great Select\r\nCommittee of Thirty-three, and it was (February 5th) after the\r\nResolutions, heretofore quoted, had been reported by it, that he\r\ncondensed the history of the situation into a nutshell, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We are at the end of the insane revel of partisan license which, for\r\nthirty years, has, in the United States, worn the mask of Government.\r\nWe are about to close the masquerade by the dance of death.  The Nations\r\nof the World look anxiously to see if the People, ere they tread that\r\nmeasure, will come to themselves.\r\n\r\n         *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n\"Southern politicians have created a North.  Let us trace the process\r\nand draw the moral.\r\n\r\n\"The laws of 1850 calmed and closed the Slavery agitation; and President\r\nPierce, elected by the almost unanimous voice of the States, did not\r\nmention Slavery in his first two Messages.  In 1854, the repeal of the\r\nMissouri Compromise, at the instance of the South, reopened the\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\n\"Northern men, deserted by Southern Whigs, were left to unite for\r\nself-defense.\r\n\r\n\"The invasion of Kansas, in 1855 and 1856, from Missouri; the making a\r\nLegislature and laws for that Territory, by the invaders; still further\r\nunited the Northern people.  The election of 1856 measured its extent.\r\n\r\n\"The election of Mr. Buchanan and his opening policy in Kansas, soothed\r\nthe irritation, and was rapidly demoralizing the new Party, when the\r\nPro-Slavery Party in Kansas perpetrated, and the President and the South\r\naccepted, the Lecompton fraud, and again united the North more\r\nresolutely in resistance to that invasion of the rights of\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\n\"The South for the first time failed to dictate terms; and the People\r\nvindicated by their votes the refusal of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"Ere this result was attained, the opinions of certain Judges of the\r\nSupreme Court scattered doubts over the law of Slavery in the\r\nTerritories; the South, while repudiating other decisions, instantly\r\nmade these opinions the criterion of faithfulness to the Constitution;\r\nwhile the North was agitated by this new sanction of the extremest\r\npretensions of their opponents.\r\n\r\n\"The South did not rest satisfied with their Judicial triumph.\r\n\r\n\"Immediately the claim was pressed for protection by Congress to\r\nSlavery, declared by the Supreme Court, they said, to exist in all the\r\nTerritories.\r\n\r\n\"This completed the union of the Free States in one great defensive\r\nleague; and the result was registered in November.  That result is now\r\nitself become the starting point of new agitation--the demand of new\r\nrights and new guarantees.  The claim to access to the Territories was\r\nfollowed by the claim to Congressional protection, and that is now\r\nfollowed by the hitherto unheard of claim to a Constitutional Amendment\r\nestablishing Slavery, not merely in territory now held, but in all\r\nhereafter held from the line of 36  30' to Cape Horn, while the debate\r\nforeshadows in the distance the claim of the right of transit and the\r\nplacing of property in Slaves in all respects on the footing of other\r\nproperty--the topics of future agitation.  How long the prohibition of\r\nthe importation of Slaves will be exempted from the doctrine of\r\nequality, it needs no prophet to tell.\r\n\r\n\"In the face of this recital, let the imputation of autocratic and\r\ntyrannical aspirations cease to be cast on the people of the Free\r\nStates; let the Southern people dismiss their fears, return to their\r\nfriendly confidence in their fellow-citizens of the North, and accept,\r\nas pledges of returning Peace, the salutary amendments of the law and\r\nthe Constitution offered as the first fruits of Reconciliation.\"\r\n\r\nBut calmness, kindness, and courtesy were alike thrown away in both\r\nHouses upon the implacable Southern leaders.  As the last day of that\r\nmemorable session, which closed in the failure of all peaceful measures\r\nto restore the Union, slowly dawned--with but a few hours lacking of the\r\ntime when Mr. Lincoln would be inaugurated President of the United\r\nStates--Mr. Wigfall thought proper, in the United States Senate, to\r\nsneer at him as \"an ex-rail-splitter, an ex-grocery keeper, an\r\nex-flatboat captain, and an ex-Abolition lecturer\"--and proceeded\r\nto scold and rant at the North with furious volubility.\r\n\r\n\"Then, briefly,\" said he, \"a Party has come into power that represents\r\nthe antagonism to my own Section of the Country.  It represents two\r\nmillion men who hate us, and who, by their votes for such a man as they\r\nhave elected, have committed an overt act of hostility.  That they have\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have won the Presidency,\" said he, to the Republicans, \"and you are\r\nnow in the situation of the man who had won the elephant at a raffle.\r\nYou do not know what to do with the beast now that you have it; and\r\none-half of you to-day would give your right arms if you had been\r\ndefeated. But you succeeded, and you have to deal with facts.  Our\r\nobjection to living in this Union, and therefore the difficulty of\r\nreconstructing it, is not your Personal Liberty bills, not the\r\nTerritorial question, but that you utterly and wholly misapprehend\r\nthe Form of Government.\"\r\n\r\n\"You deny,\" continued he, \"the Sovereignty of the States; you deny the\r\nright of self-government in the People; you insist upon Negro Equality;\r\nyour people interfere impertinently with our Institutions and attempt to\r\nsubvert them; you publish newspapers; you deliver lectures; you print\r\npamphlets, and you send them among us, first, to excite our Slaves to\r\ninsurrection against their masters, and next, to array one class of\r\ncitizens against the other; and I say to you, that we cannot live in\r\npeace, either in the Union or out of it, until you have abolished your\r\nAbolition societies; not, as I have been misquoted, abolish or destroy\r\nyour school-houses; but until you have ceased in your schoolhouses\r\nteaching your children to hate us; until you have ceased to convert your\r\npulpits into hustings; until you content yourselves with preaching\r\nChrist, and Him crucified, and not delivering political harangues on the\r\nSabbath; until you have ceased inciting your own citizens to make raids\r\nand commit robberies; until you have done these things we cannot live in\r\nthe same Union with you.  Until you do these things, we cannot live out\r\nof the Union at Peace.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the words--the spiteful, bitter words--with which this chosen\r\nspokesman of the South saluted the cold and cloudy dawn of that day\r\nwhich was to see the sceptre depart from the hands of the Slave Power\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nA few hours later, under the shadow of the main Pastern Portico of the\r\nCapitol at Washington--with the retiring President and Cabinet, the\r\nSupreme Court Justices, the Foreign Diplomatic Corps, and hundreds of\r\nSenators, Representatives and other distinguished persons filling the\r\ngreat platform on either side and behind them--Abraham Lincoln stood\r\nbareheaded before full thirty thousand people, upon whose uplifted faces\r\nthe unveiled glory of the mild Spring sun now shone--stood reverently\r\nbefore that far greater and mightier Presence termed by himself, \"My\r\nrightful masters, the American People\"--and pleaded in a manly, earnest,\r\nand affectionate strain with \"such as were dissatisfied,\" to listen to\r\nthe \"better angels\" of their nature.\r\n\r\nTemperate, reasonable, kindly, persuasive--it seems strange that Mr.\r\nLincoln's Inaugural Address did not disarm at least the personal\r\nresentment of the South toward him, and sufficiently strengthen the\r\nUnion-loving people there, against the red-hot Secessionists, to put the\r\n\"brakes\" down on Rebellion.  Said he:\r\n\r\n\"Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States,\r\nthat by the accession of a Republican Administration, their Property and\r\ntheir Peace and personal security are to be endangered.  There has never\r\nbeen any reasonable cause for such apprehension.  Indeed, the most ample\r\nevidence to the contrary has all the while existed, and been open to\r\ntheir inspection.  It is found in nearly all the published speeches of\r\nhim who now addresses you.  I do but quote from one of those speeches,\r\nwhen I declare that 'I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to\r\ninterfere with the Institution of Slavery in the States where it\r\nexists.'  I believe I have no lawful right to do so; and I have no\r\ninclination to do so.  Those who nominated and elected me, did so with\r\nthe full knowledge that I had made this, and many similar declarations,\r\nand had never recanted them.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"I now reiterate these sentiments; and in doing so, I only press upon\r\nthe public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is\r\nsusceptible, that the Property, Peace, and Security of no Section are to\r\nbe in any wise endangered by the now incoming Administration.  I add,\r\ntoo, that all the protection which, consistently with the Constitution\r\nand the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given to all the States,\r\nwhen lawfully demanded, for whatever cause--as cheerfully to one Section\r\nas to another.\r\n\r\n\"I take the official oath to-day with no mental reservations, and with\r\nno purpose to construe the Constitution or laws by any hypercritical\r\nrules.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"A disruption of the Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now\r\nformidably attempted.  I hold that, in contemplation of Universal Law,\r\nand of the Constitution, the Union of these States is perpetual.\r\nPerpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all\r\nNational Governments.  It is safe to assert that no Government proper\r\never had a provision in its organic law for its own termination.\r\nContinue to execute all the express provisions of our National\r\nConstitution, and the Union will endure forever--it being impossible to\r\ndestroy it, except by some action not provided for in the instrument\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\"Again, if the United States be not a Government proper, but an\r\nAssociation of States in the nature of a contract merely, can it, as a\r\ncontract, be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it?\r\nOne party to a contract may violate it--break it, so to speak; but does\r\nit not require all, to lawfully rescind it?\r\n\r\n\"Descending from these general principles, we find the proposition that,\r\nin legal contemplation, the Union is perpetual, confirmed by the history\r\nof the Union itself.  The Union is much older than the Constitution.  It\r\nwas formed, in fact, by the Articles of Association in 1774.  It was\r\nmatured and continued in the Declaration of Independence in 1776.  It\r\nwas further matured, and the faith of all the then thirteen States\r\nexpressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the\r\nArticles of Confederation, in 1778; and, finally, in 1787, one of the\r\ndeclared objects, for ordaining and establishing the Constitution, was\r\n'to form a more perfect Union.'  But, if destruction of the Union by\r\none, or by a part only, of the States, be lawfully possible, the Union\r\nis less perfect than before, the Constitution having lost the vital\r\nelement of perpetuity.\r\n\r\n\"It follows, from these views, that no State, upon its own mere motion,\r\ncan lawfully get out of the Union; that Resolves and Ordinances to that\r\neffect, are legally void; and that acts of violence within any State or\r\nStates against the authority of the United States, are insurrectionary\r\nor revolutionary, according to circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"I therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws,\r\nthe Union is unbroken, and, to the extent of my ability, I shall take\r\ncare, as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the\r\nlaws of the Union shall be faithfully executed in all the States.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the declared\r\npurpose of the Union, that it will Constitutionally defend and maintain\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\"In doing this, there need be no bloodshed or violence, and there shall\r\nbe none, unless it is forced upon the National Authority.\r\n\r\n\"The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the\r\nproperty and places belonging to the Government, and to collect the\r\nduties and imposts; but, beyond what may be necessary for these objects,\r\nthere will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the People\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\n\"The mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts\r\nof the Union.\r\n\r\n                   *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n\"Is there such perfect identity of interests among the States to compose\r\na new Union, as to produce harmony only, and prevent renewed Secession?\r\nPlainly, the central idea of Secession is the essence of anarchy.  A\r\nmajority, held in restraint by Constitutional checks and limitations and\r\nalways changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and\r\nsentiments, is the only true sovereign of a Free People.  Whoever\r\nrejects it, does, of necessity, fly to anarchy, or to despotism.\r\nUnanimity is impossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent\r\narrangement, is wholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority\r\nprinciple, anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left.\r\n\r\n                    *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n\"Physically speaking, we cannot separate.  We cannot remove our\r\nrespective Sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall\r\nbetween them.  A husband and wife may be divorced, and go out of the\r\npresence and beyond the reach of each other; but the different parts of\r\nour Country cannot do this.  They cannot but remain face to face; and\r\nintercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them.  Is\r\nit possible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more\r\nsatisfactory after separation than before?  Can aliens make treaties,\r\neasier than friends can make laws?  Can treaties be more faithfully\r\nenforced between aliens, than laws can among friends?  Suppose you go to\r\nWar, you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides,\r\nand no gain on either you cease fighting, the identical old questions,\r\nas to terms of intercourse, are again upon you.\r\n\r\n\"This Country, with its Institutions, belongs to the People who inhabit\r\nit.  Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing Government, they can\r\nexercise their Constitutional right of amending it, or their\r\nRevolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it.  I cannot be ignorant\r\nof the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of\r\nhaving the National Constitution amended.  While I make no\r\nrecommendations of Amendments, I fully recognize the rightful authority\r\nof the People over the whole subject, to be exercised in either of the\r\nmodes prescribed in the instrument itself; and I should, under existing\r\ncircumstances, favor, rather than oppose, a fair opportunity being\r\nafforded the People to act upon it.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"The Chief Magistrate derives all his authority from the People, and\r\nthey have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the\r\nStates.  The People themselves can do this also, if they choose; but the\r\nExecutive, as such, has nothing to do with it.  His duty is to\r\nadminister the present Government, as it came to his hands, and to\r\ntransmit it, unimpaired by him, to his successor.\r\n\r\n                  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n\" * * * While the People retain their virtue and vigilance, no\r\nAdministration, by any extreme of weakness or folly, can very seriously\r\ninjure the Government in the short space of four years.\r\n\r\n\"My countrymen, one and all, think calmly and well upon this whole\r\nsubject.  Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time.  If there be an\r\nobject to hurry any of you, in hot haste, to a step which you would\r\nnever take deliberately, that object will be frustrated by taking time;\r\nbut no good object can be frustrated by it.  Such of you as are now\r\ndissatisfied, still have the old Constitution unimpaired, and, on the\r\nsensitive point, the laws of your own framing under it; while the new\r\nAdministration will have no immediate power, if it would, to change\r\neither.  If it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied, hold the\r\nright side in the dispute, there still is no single good reason for\r\nprecipitate action.  Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity, and a firm\r\nreliance on Him who has never yet forsaken this favored Land, are still\r\ncompetent to adjust, in the best way, all our present difficulty.\r\n\r\n\"In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in mine, is\r\nthe momentous issue of Civil War.  The Government will not assault you.\r\nYou can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors.  You\r\nhave no oath registered in Heaven to destroy the Government, while I\r\nshall have the most solemn one to 'preserve, protect, and defend it'.\r\n\r\n\"I am loath to close.  We are not enemies, but friends.  We must not be\r\nenemies.  Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds\r\nof affection.  The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every\r\nbattle-field and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone,\r\nall over this broad Land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when\r\nagain touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our\r\nnature.\"\r\n\r\nStrange, indeed, must have been the thoughts that crowded through the\r\nbrain and oppressed the heart of Abraham Lincoln that night--his first\r\nat the White House!\r\n\r\nThe city of Washington swarmed with Rebels and Rebel sympathizers, and\r\nall the departments of Government were honey-combed with Treason and\r\nshadowed with treachery and espionage.  Every step proposed or\r\ncontemplated by the Government would be known to the so-called\r\nGovernment of the Confederate States almost as soon as thought of.  All\r\nmeans, to thwart and delay the carrying out of the Government's\r\npurposes, that the excuses of routine and red-tape admitted of, would be\r\nused by the Traitors within the camp, to aid the Traitors without.\r\n\r\nNo one knew all this, better than Mr. Lincoln.  With no Army, no Navy,\r\nnot even a Revenue cutter left--with forts and arsenals, ammunition and\r\narms in possession of the Rebels, with no money in the National\r\nTreasury, and the National credit blasted--the position must, even to\r\nhis hopeful nature, have seemed at this time desperate.  To be sure,\r\ndespite threats, neither few nor secret, which had been made, that he\r\nshould not live to be inaugurated, he had passed the first critical\r\npoint--had taken the inaugural oath--and was now duly installed in the\r\nWhite House.  That was something, of course, to be profoundly thankful\r\nfor.  But the matter regarded by him of larger moment--the safety of the\r\nUnion--how about that?\r\n\r\nHow that great, and just, and kindly brain, in the dim shadows of that\r\nawful first night at the White House, must have searched up and down and\r\nalong the labyrinths of history and \"corridors of time,\" everywhere in\r\nthe Past, for any analogy or excuse for the madness of this Secession\r\nmovement--and searched in vain!\r\n\r\nWith his grand and abounding faith in God, how Abraham Lincoln must have\r\nstormed the very gates of Heaven that night with prayer that he might be\r\nthe means of securing Peace and Union to his beloved but distracted\r\nCountry!  How his great heart must have been racked with the\r\nalternations of hope and foreboding--of trustfulness and doubt!\r\nAnxiously he must have looked for the light of the morrow, that he might\r\ngather from the Press, the manner in which his Inaugural had been\r\nreceived.  Not that he feared the North--but the South; how would the\r\nwayward, wilful, passionate South, receive his proffered olive-branch?\r\n\r\nSurely, surely,--thus ran his thoughts--when the brave, and gallant, and\r\ngenerous people of that Section came to read his message of Peace and\r\nGood-will, they must see the suicidal folly of their course!  Surely\r\ntheir hearts must be touched and the mists of prejudice dissolved, so\r\nthat reason would resume her sway, and Reconciliation follow!  A little\r\nmore time for reflection would yet make all things right.  The young men\r\nof the South, fired by the Southern leaders' false appeals, must soon\r\nreturn to reason.  The prairie fire is terrible while it sweeps along,\r\nbut it soon burns out.  When the young men face the emblem of their\r\nNation's glory--the flag of the land of their birth--then will come the\r\nreaction and their false leaders will be hurled from place and power,\r\nand all will again be right.  Yea, when it comes to firing on the old,\r\nold flag, they will not, cannot, do it!  Between the Compromise within\r\ntheir reach, and such Sacrilege as this, they cannot waver long.\r\n\r\nSo, doubtless, all the long night, whether waking or sleeping, the mind\r\nof this true-hearted son of the West, throbbed with the mighty weight of\r\nthe problem entrusted to him for solution, and the vast responsibilities\r\nwhich he had just assumed toward his fellow-men, his Nation, and his\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nAnd when, at last, the long lean frame was thrown upon the couch, and\r\n\"tired Nature's sweet restorer\" held him briefly in her arms, the smile\r\nof hopefulness on the wan cheek told that, despite all the terrible\r\ndifficulties of the situation, the sleeper was sustained by a strong and\r\ncheerful belief in the Providence of God, the Patriotism of the People,\r\nand the efficacy of his Inaugural Peace-offering to the South. But alas,\r\nand alas, for the fallibility of human judgment and human hopes!\r\nInstead of a message of Peace, the South chose to regard it as a message\r\nof Menace;* and it was not received in a much better spirit by some of\r\nthe Northern papers, which could see no good in it--\"no Union spirit in\r\nit\"--but declared that it breathed the spirit of Sectionalism and\r\nmischief, and \"is the knell and requiem of the Union, and the death of\r\nhope.\"\r\n\r\n     [\"Mr. Lincoln fondly regarded his Inaugural as a resistless\r\n     proffering of the olive branch to the South; the Conspirators\r\n     everywhere interpreted it as a challenge to War.\"--Greeley's Am.\r\n     Conflict, vol. i., p. 428.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBitter indeed must have been President Lincoln's disappointment and\r\nsorrow at the reception of his Inaugural.  With the heartiest\r\nforgiveness, in the noblest spirit of paternal kindness, he had\r\ngenerously held out his arms, as far as they could reach, to clasp to\r\nhis heart--to the great heart of the Union--the rash children of the\r\nSouth, if they would but let him.  It was more with sorrow, than in\r\nanger, that he looked upon their contemptuous repulsion of his advances;\r\nand his soul still reproachfully yearned toward these his Southern\r\nbrethren, as did that of a higher than he toward His misguided brethren,\r\nwhen He cried: \"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets,\r\nand stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have\r\ngathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens\r\nunder her wings, and ye would not!\"\r\n\r\nOn the day following his Inauguration, President Lincoln sent to the\r\nUnited States Senate the names of those whom he had chosen to constitute\r\nhis Cabinet, as follows: William H. Seward, of New York, Secretary of\r\nState; Salmon P. Chase, of Ohio, Secretary of the Treasury; Simon\r\nCameron, of Pennsylvania, Secretary of War; Gideon Welles, of\r\nConnecticut, Secretary of the Navy; Caleb B.  Smith, of Indiana,\r\nSecretary of the Interior; Edward Bates, of Missouri, Attorney General;\r\nand Montgomery Blair, of Maryland, Postmaster General.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the President of the rebellious Confederacy,\r\nJefferson Davis, had partly constituted his Cabinet already, as follows:\r\nRobert Toombs, of Georgia, Secretary of State; Charles G.  Memminger, of\r\nSouth Carolina, Secretary of the Treasury; Leroy Pope Walker, of\r\nAlabama, Secretary of War; to whom he afterwards added: Stephen R.\r\nMallory, of Florida, Secretary of the Navy; and John H. Reagan, of\r\nTexas, Postmaster-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n                    THE WAR-DRUM \"ON TO WASHINGTON\"\r\n\r\nScarcely one week had elapsed after the Administration of Mr. Lincoln\r\nbegan, when (March 11th) certain \"Commissioners of the Southern\r\nConfederacy\" (John Forsyth, of Alabama, and Martin J. Crawford, of\r\nGeorgia), appeared at Washington and served a written request upon\r\nthe State Department to appoint an early day when they might present to\r\nthe President of the United States their credentials \"from the\r\nGovernment of the Confederate States of America\" to the Government of\r\nthe United States, and open \"the objects of the mission with which they\r\nare charged.\"\r\n\r\nSecretary Seward, with the President's sanction, declined official\r\nintercourse with Messrs. Forsyth and Crawford, in a \"Memorandum\" (March\r\n15th) reciting their request, etc., in which, after referring to\r\nPresident Lincoln's Inaugural Address--forwarded to them with the\r\n\"Memorandum\" he says: \"A simple reference will be sufficient to satisfy\r\nthose gentlemen that the Secretary of State, guided by the principles\r\ntherein announced, is prevented altogether from admitting or assuming\r\nthat the States referred to by them have, in law or in fact, withdrawn\r\nfrom the Federal Union, or that they could do so in the manner described\r\nby Messrs. Forsyth and Crawford, or in any other manner than with the\r\nconsent and concert of the People of the United States, to be given\r\nthrough a National Convention, to be assembled in conformity with the\r\nprovisions of the Constitution of the United States.  Of course, the\r\nSecretary of State cannot act upon the assumption, or in any way admit,\r\nthat the so-called Confederate States constitute a Foreign Power, with\r\nwhom diplomatic relations ought to be established.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of April, Messrs. Forsyth, Crawford and Roman--as\r\n\"Commissioners of the Southern Confederacy\"--addressed to Secretary\r\nSeward a reply to the \"Memorandum\" aforesaid, in which the following\r\npassage occurs:\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned, like the Secretary of State, have no purpose to\r\n'invite or engage in discussion' of the subject on which their two\r\nGovernments are so irreconcilably at variance.  It is this variance that\r\nhas broken up the old Union, the disintegration of which has only begun.\r\n\r\n\"It is proper, however, to advise you that it were well to dismiss the\r\nhopes you seem to entertain that, by any of the modes indicated, the\r\npeople of the Confederate States will ever be brought to submit to the\r\nauthority of the Government of the United States.  You are dealing with\r\ndelusions, too, when you seek to separate our people from our\r\nGovernment, and to characterize the deliberate, Sovereign act of that\r\npeople as a 'perversion of a temporary and partisan excitement.'  If you\r\ncherish these dreams, you will be awakened from them, and find them as\r\nunreal and unsubstantial as others in which you have recently indulged.\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned would omit the performance of an obvious duty were they\r\nto fail to make known to the Government of the United States that the\r\npeople of the Confederate States have declared their independence with a\r\nfull knowledge of all the responsibilities of that act, and with as firm\r\na determination to maintain it by all the means with which nature has\r\nendowed them as that which sustained their fathers when they threw off\r\nthe authority of the British Crown.\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned clearly understand that you have declined to appoint a\r\nday to enable them to lay the objects of the mission with which they are\r\ncharged, before the President of the United States, because so to do\r\nwould be to recognize the independence and separate nationality of the\r\nConfederate States.  This is the vein of thought that pervades the\r\nmemorandum before us.\r\n\r\n\"The truth of history requires that it should distinctly appear upon the\r\nrecord, that the undersigned did not ask the Government of the United\r\nStates to recognize the independence of the Confederate States.  They\r\nonly asked audience to adjust, in a spirit of amity and peace, the new\r\nrelations springing from a manifest and accomplished revolution in the\r\nGovernment of the late Federal Union.\r\n\r\n\"Your refusal to entertain these overtures for a peaceful solution, the\r\nactive naval and military preparation of this Government, and a formal\r\nnotice to the Commanding General of the Confederate forces in the harbor\r\nof Charleston that the President intends to provision Fort Sumter by\r\nforcible means, if necessary, are viewed by the undersigned, and can\r\nonly be received by the World, as a Declaration of War against the\r\nConfederate States; for the President of the United States knows that\r\nFort Sumter cannot be provisioned without the effusion of blood.\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned, in behalf of their Government and people, accept the\r\ngage of battle thus thrown down to them, and, appealing to God and the\r\njudgment of mankind for the righteousness of their Cause, the people of\r\nthe Confederate States will defend their liberties to the last, against\r\nthis flagrant and open attempt at their subjugation to Sectional power.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now, for a moment, glance at the condition of Fort Sumter, and of\r\nthe Government with regard to it:\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of March, the day after President Lincoln had taken his oath\r\nof office, there was placed in his hands a letter of Major Anderson,\r\ncommanding at Fort Sumter, in which that officer, under date of the 28th\r\nof February, expressed the opinion that \"reinforcements could not be\r\nthrown into that fort within the time for his relief rendered necessary\r\nby the limited supply of provisions, and with a view of holding\r\npossession of the same, with a force of less than twenty thousand good\r\nand well-disciplined men.\"\r\n\r\n     [President Lincoln's first Message, July 4, 1861.]\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General Winfield Scott concurred in that opinion, and as the\r\nprovisions in the Fort would be exhausted before any such force could be\r\nraised and brought to the ground, evacuation and safe withdrawal of the\r\nFederal garrison from the Fort became a Military necessity, and was so\r\nregarded by the Administration.\r\n\r\n\"It was believed, however\"--in the language of Mr. Lincoln himself, in\r\nhis first Message to Congress--\"that to so abandon that position, under\r\nthe circumstances, would be utterly ruinous: that the necessity under\r\nwhich it was to be done would not be fully understood; that by many it\r\nwould be construed as a part of a voluntary policy; that at home it\r\nwould discourage the friends of the Union, embolden its adversaries, and\r\ngo far to insure to the latter a recognition abroad; that in fact it\r\nwould be our National destruction consummated.  This could not be\r\nallowed.  Starvation was not yet upon the garrison; and ere it would be\r\nreached, Fort Pickens might be reinforced.  This last would be a clear\r\nindication of policy, and would better enable the country to accept the\r\nevacuation of Fort Sumter as a Military necessity.\"\r\n\r\nOwing to misconception or otherwise, an order to reinforce Fort Pickens\r\nwas not carried out, and an expedition to relieve Fort Sumter was then\r\nordered to be dispatched.  On the 8th of April President Lincoln, by\r\nmessenger, notified Governor Pickens of South Carolina, \"that he might\r\nexpect an attempt would be made to provision the fort; and that if the\r\nattempt should not be resisted there would be no effort to throw in men,\r\narms, or ammunition, without further notice, or in case of an attack\r\nupon the fort.\"\r\n\r\nA crisis was evidently approaching, and public feeling all over the\r\nCountry was wrought up to the highest degree of tension and stood\r\ntip-toe with intense expectancy.  The test of the doctrine of Secession\r\nwas about to be made there, in the harbor of Charleston, upon which the\r\neyes of Patriot and Rebel were alike feverishly bent.\r\n\r\nThere, in Charleston harbor, grimly erect, stood the octagon-shaped Fort\r\nSumter, mid-way of the harbor entrance, the Stars and Stripes proudly\r\nwaving from its lofty central flagstaff, its guns bristling on every\r\nside through the casemates and embrasures, as if with a knowledge of\r\ntheir defensive power.\r\n\r\nAbout equidistant from Fort Sumter on either side of the\r\nharbor-entrance, were the Rebel works at Fort Moultrie and Battery Bee\r\non Sullivan's Island, on the one side, and Cummings Point Battery, on\r\nMorris Island, on the other-besides a number of other batteries facing\r\nseaward along the sea-coast line of Morris Island.  Further in, on the\r\nsame side of the harbor, and but little further off from Fort Sumter,\r\nstood Fort Johnson on James Island, while Castle Pinckney and a Floating\r\nBattery were between the beleagured Fort and the city of Charleston.\r\n\r\nThus, the Federal Fort was threatened with the concentrated fire of\r\nthese well-manned Rebel fortifications on all sides, and in its then\r\ncondition was plainly doomed; for, while the swarming Rebels, unmolested\r\nby Fort Sumter, had been permitted to surround that Fort with frowning\r\nbatteries, whose guns outnumbered those of the Fort, as ten to one, and\r\nwhose caliber was also superior, its own condition was anything but that\r\nof readiness for the inevitable coming encounter.\r\n\r\nThat the officers' quarters, barracks, and other frame-work wooden\r\nbuildings should have been permitted to remain as a standing invitation\r\nto conflagration from bombardment, can only be accounted for on the\r\nsupposition that the gallant officer in command, himself a Southerner,\r\nwould not believe it possible that the thousands of armed Americans by\r\nwhom he was threatened and encircled, could fire upon the flag of their\r\nown native Country.  He and his garrison of seventy men, were soon to\r\nlearn the bitter truth, amid a tempest of bursting shot and shell, the\r\nfurnace-heat of crackling walls, and suffocating volumes of dense smoke\r\nproduced by an uncontrollable conflagration.\r\n\r\nThe Rebel leaders at Washington had prevented an attack in January upon\r\nthe forts in the harbor of Charleston, and at Pensacola.--[McPherson's\r\nHistory of the Rebellion, p.  112.]--In consequence of which failure to\r\nproceed to the last extremity at once, the energies of the Rebellion had\r\nperceptibly diminished.\r\n\r\nSaid the Mobile Mercury: \"The country is sinking into a fatal apathy,\r\nand the spirit and even the patriotism of the people is oozing out,\r\nunder this do-nothing policy.  If something is not done pretty soon,\r\ndecisive, either evacuation or expulsion, the whole country will become\r\nso disgusted with the sham of Southern independence that the first\r\nchance the people get at a popular election they will turn the whole\r\nmovement topsy-turvy so bad that it never on Earth can be righted\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the inauguration of Mr. Lincoln, however, the Rebel authorities at\r\nMontgomery lost no time, but strained every nerve to precipitate War.\r\nThey felt that there was danger to the cause of Secession in delay; that\r\nthere were wavering States outside the Confederacy, like Virginia, that\r\nmight be dragged into the Confederacy by prompt and bloody work; and\r\nwavering States within, like Alabama, that must be kept in by similar\r\nmeans.  Their emissaries were busy everywhere in the South, early in\r\nApril, preaching an instant crusade against the old flag--inciting the\r\npeople to demand instant hostilities against Fort Sumter--and to cross a\r\nRubicon of blood, over which there could be no return.\r\n\r\nMany of the Rebel leaders seemed to be haunted by the fear (no doubt\r\nwell founded) that unless blood was shed--unless an impassable barrier,\r\ncrimsoned with human gore, was raised between the new Confederacy and\r\nthe old Union--there would surely be an ever-present danger of that\r\nConfederacy falling to pieces.  Hence they were now active in working\r\nthe people up to the required point of frenzy.\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of their speeches, may be quoted that of Roger A. Pryor,\r\nof Virginia, who, at Charleston, April 10, 1861, replying to a serenade,\r\nsaid:--[Charleston Mercury's report.]\r\n\r\n'Gentlemen, I thank you, especially that you have at last annihilated\r\nthis accursed Union [Applause] reeking with corruption, and insolent\r\nwith excess of tyranny.  Thank God, it is at last blasted and riven by\r\nthe lightning wrath of an outraged and indignant people.  [Loud\r\napplause.]  Not only is it gone, but gone forever.  [Cries of, 'You're\r\nright,' and applause.] In the expressive language of Scripture, it is\r\nwater spilt upon the ground, which cannot be gathered up.  [Applause.]\r\nLike Lucifer, son of the morning, it has fallen, never to rise again.\r\n[Continued applause.]\r\n\r\n\"For my part, gentlemen,\" he continued, as soon as he could be heard,\r\n\"if Abraham Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin to-morrow were to abdicate their\r\noffices and were to give me a blank sheet of paper to write the\r\ncondition of re-annexation to the defunct Union, I would scornfully\r\nspurn the overture.  * * *  I invoke you, and I make it in some sort a\r\npersonal appeal--personal so far as it tends to our assistance in\r\nVirginia--I do invoke you, in your demonstrations of popular opinion, in\r\nyour exhibitions of official intent, to give no countenance to this idea\r\nof reconstruction.  [Many voices, emphatically, 'never,' and applause.]\r\n\r\n\"In Virginia,\" resumed he, \"they all say, if reduced to the dread\r\ndilemma of this memorable alternative, they will espouse the cause of\r\nthe South as against the interest of the Northern Confederacy, but they\r\nwhisper of reconstruction, and they say Virginia must abide in the\r\nUnion, with the idea of reconstructing the Union which you have\r\nannihilated.  I pray you, gentlemen, rob them of that idea.  Proclaim to\r\nthe World that upon no condition, and under no circumstances, will South\r\nCarolina ever again enter into political association with the\r\nAbolitionists of New England.  [Cries of 'never,' and applause.]\r\n\r\n\"Do not distrust Virginia,\" he continued; \"as sure as tomorrow's sun\r\nwill rise upon us, just so sure will Virginia be a member of this\r\nSouthern Confederation.  [Applause.]  And I will tell you, gentlemen,\r\nwhat will put her in the Southern Confederacy in less than an hour by\r\nShrewsbury clock--STRIKE A BLOW!  [Tremendous applause.]  The very\r\nmoment that blood is shed, old Virginia will make common cause with her\r\nsisters of the South.  [Applause.]  It is impossible she should do\r\notherwise.\"\r\n\r\nThe question of the necessity of \"Striking a Blow\"--of the immediate\r\n\"shedding of blood\"--was not only discussed before the Southern people\r\nfor the purpose of inflaming their rebellious zeal, but was also the\r\nsubject of excited agitation in the Confederate Cabinet at this time.\r\n\r\nIn a speech made by ex-United States Senator Clemens of Alabama, at\r\nHuntsville, Alabama, at the close of the Rebellion, he told the\r\nAlabamians how their State, which, as we have seen, was becoming\r\ndecidedly shaky in its allegiance to the \"Sham of Southern\r\nIndependence,\" was kept in the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nSaid he: \"In 1861, shortly after the Confederate Government was put in\r\noperation, I was in the city of Montgomery.  One day (April 11, 1861) I\r\nstepped into the office of the Secretary of War, General Walker, and\r\nfound there, engaged in a very excited discussion, Mr. Jefferson Davis\r\n(the President), Mr. Memminger (Secretary of the Treasury), Mr. Benjamin\r\n(Attorney-General), Mr. Gilchrist, a member of our Legislature from\r\nLoundes county, and a number of other prominent gentlemen.  They were\r\ndiscussing the propriety of immediately opening fire on Fort Sumter, to\r\nwhich General Walker, the Secretary of War, appeared to be opposed.  Mr.\r\nGilchrist said to him, 'Sir, unless you sprinkle blood in the face of\r\nthe people of Alabama, they will be back in the old Union in less than\r\nten days!'  THE NEXT DAY GENERAL BEAUREGARD OPENED HIS BATTERIES ON\r\nSUMTER, AND ALABAMA WAS SAVED TO THE CONFEDERACY.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of April, G. T. Beauregard, \"Brigadier General Commanding\"\r\nthe \"Provisional Army C. S. A.\"  at Charleston, S. C., notified the\r\nConfederate Secretary of War (Walker) at Montgomery, Ala., that \"An\r\nauthorized messenger from President Lincoln has just informed Gov.\r\nPickens and myself that provisions will be sent to Fort Sumter\r\npeaceably, or otherwise by force.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 10th, Confederate Secretary Walker telegraphed to Beauregard: \"If\r\nyou have no doubt of the authorized character of the agent who\r\ncommunicated to, you the intention of the Washington Government to\r\nsupply Fort Sumter by force, you will at once demand its evacuation,\r\nand, if this is refused, proceed, in such manner as you may determine,\r\nto reduce it.\"  To this Beauregard at once replied: \"The demand will be\r\nmade to-morrow at 12 o'clock.\"  Thereupon the Confederate Secretary\r\ntelegraphed again: \"Unless there are special reasons connected with your\r\nown condition, it is considered proper that you should make the demand\r\nat an earlier hour.\"  And Beauregard answered: \"The reasons are special\r\nfor 12 o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 11th General Beauregard notified Secretary Walker: \"The demand\r\nwas sent at 2 P. M., and until 6 was allowed for the answer.\"  The\r\nSecretary desiring to have the reply of Major Anderson, General\r\nBeauregard telegraphed: \"Major Anderson replies: 'I have the honor to\r\nacknowledge the receipt of your communication demanding the evacuation\r\nof this Fort, and to say in reply thereto that it is a demand with which\r\nI regret that my sense of honor and of my obligation to my Government\r\nprevent my compliance.'  He adds, verbally, 'I will await the first\r\nshot, and, if you do not batter us to pieces, we will be starved out in\r\na few days.'\"\r\n\r\nTo this, the Confederate Secretary at once responded with: \"Do not\r\ndesire needlessly to bombard Fort Sumter.  If Major Anderson will state\r\nthe time at which, as indicated by himself, he will evacuate, and agree\r\nthat, in the mean time, he will not use his guns against us unless ours\r\nshould be employed against Fort Sumter, you are authorized thus to avoid\r\nthe effusion of blood.  If this or its equivalent be refused, reduce the\r\nFort, as your judgment decides to be the most practicable.\"\r\n\r\nAt 11 o'clock that night (April 11) General Beauregard sent to Major\r\nAnderson, by the hands of his aides-de-camp, Messrs. Chesnut and Lee, a\r\nfurther communication, in which, after alluding to the Major's verbal\r\nobservation, the General said: \"If you will state the time at which you\r\nwill evacuate Fort Sumter, and agree that in the mean time you will not\r\nuse your guns against us unless ours shall be employed against Fort\r\nSumter, we shall abstain from opening fire upon you.  Col. Chesnut and\r\nCapt. Lee are authorized by me to enter into such an agreement with you.\r\nYou are therefore requested to communicate to them an open answer.\"\r\n\r\nTo this, Major Robert Anderson, at 2.30 A.M. of the 12th, replied \"that,\r\ncordially uniting with you in the desire to avoid the useless effusion\r\nof blood, I will, if provided with the necessary means of\r\ntransportation, evacuate Fort Sumter by noon on the 15th inst., should I\r\nnot receive prior to that time, controlling instructions from my\r\nGovernment, or additional supplies, and that I will not in the mean time\r\nopen my fire upon your forces unless compelled to do so by some hostile\r\nact against this Fort or the flag of my Government, by the forces under\r\nyour command, or by some portion of them, or by the perpetration of some\r\nact showing a hostile intention on your part against this Fort or the\r\nflag it bears.\"  Thereupon General Beauregard telegraphed Secretary\r\nWalker: \"He would not consent.  I write to-day.\"\r\n\r\nAt 3.20 A.M., Major Anderson received from Messrs.  Chesnut and Lee a\r\nnotification to this effect: \"By authority of Brigadier General\r\nBeauregard, commanding the Provisional Forces of the Confederate States,\r\nwe have the honor to notify you that he will open the fire of his\r\nbatteries on Fort Sumter in one hour from this time.\"  And a later\r\ndispatch from General Beauregard to Secretary Walker, April 12,\r\nlaconically stated: \"WE OPENED FIRE AT 4.30.\"\r\n\r\nAt last the hour and the minute had come, for which the Slave Power of\r\nthe South had for thirty years so impatiently longed.  At last the\r\nmoment had come, when all the long-treasured vengeance of the South\r\n--outgrown from questions of Tariff, of Slavery, and of Secession--was to\r\nbe poured out in blood and battle; when the panoplied powers and forces\r\nof rebellious confederated States, standing face to face with the\r\nresolute patriotism of an outraged Union, would belch forth flame and\r\nfury and hurtling missiles upon the Federal Fort and the old flag\r\nfloating o'er it.\r\n\r\nAnd whose the sacrilegious hand that dared be first raised against his\r\nCountry and his Country's flag?  Stevens's mortar battery at Sullivan's\r\nIsland is ready to open, when a lean, long-haired old man, with eyes\r\nblazing in their deep fanatical sockets, totters hastily forward and\r\nravenously seizing in his bony hands a lanyard, pulls the string, and,\r\nwith a flash and roar, away speeds the shrieking shell on its mission of\r\ndestruction; and, while shell after shell, and shot after shot, from\r\nbattery after battery, screams a savage accompaniment to the boom and\r\nflash and bellow of the guns, that lean old man works his clutched\r\nfingers in an ecstasy of fiendish pleasure, and chuckles: \"Aye, I told\r\nthem at Columbia that night, that the defense of the South is only to be\r\nsecured through the lead of South Carolina; and, old as I am, I had come\r\nhere to join them in that lead--and I have done it.\"\r\n\r\n     [Edmund Ruffin, see p.  100.  This theory of the necessity of South\r\n     Carolina leading, had long been held, as in the following, first\r\n     published in the New York Tribune, July 3, 1862, which, among other\r\n     letters, was found in the house of William H.  Trescot, on\r\n     Barnwell's Island, South Carolina, when re-occupied by United\r\n     States troops:\r\n\r\n     \"VIRGINIA CONVENTION, May 3, 1851\r\n\r\n     \"My DEAR, SIR:--You misunderstood my last letter, if you supposed\r\n     that I intended to visit South Carolina this Spring.  I am\r\n     exceedingly obliged to you for your kind invitations, and it would\r\n     afford me the highest pleasure to interchange in person, sentiments\r\n     with a friend whose manner of thinking so closely agrees with my\r\n     own.  But my engagements here closely confine me to this city, and\r\n     deny me such a gratification.\r\n\r\n     \"I would be especially glad to be in Charleston next week, and\r\n     witness the proceedings of your Convention of Delegates from the\r\n     Southern Rights Associations.  The condition of things in your\r\n     State deeply interests me.  Her wise foresight and manly\r\n     independence have placed her, as the head of the South, to whom\r\n     alone true-hearted men can look with any hope or pleasure.\r\n\r\n     \"Momentous are the consequences which depend upon your action.\r\n     Which party will prevail?  The immediate Secessionists, or those\r\n     who are opposed to separate State action at this time?  For my part\r\n     I forbear to form a wish.  Were I a Carolinian, it would be very\r\n     different; but when I consider the serious effects the decision may\r\n     have on your future weal or woe, I feel that a citizen of a State\r\n     which has acted as Virginia, has no right to interfere, even by a\r\n     wish.\r\n\r\n     \"If the General Government allows you peaceably and freely to\r\n     Secede, neither Virginia, nor any other Southern State, would, in\r\n     my opinion, follow you at present.  But what would be the effect\r\n     upon South Carolina?  Some of our best friends have supposed that\r\n     it would cut off Charleston from the great Western trade, which she\r\n     is now striking for, and would retard very greatly the progress of\r\n     your State.  I confess that I think differently.  I believe\r\n     thoroughly in our own theories, and that, even if Charleston did\r\n     not grow quite as fast in her trade with other States, yet the\r\n     relief from Federal taxation would vastly stimulate your\r\n     prosperity.  If so, the prestige of the Union would be destroyed,\r\n     and you would be the nucleus for a Southern Confederation at no\r\n     distant day.\r\n\r\n     \"But I do not doubt, from all I have been able toe to learn that the\r\n     Federal Government would use force, beginning with the form most\r\n     embarrassing to you, and least calculated to excite sympathy.  I\r\n     mean a naval blockade.  In that event, could you stand the reaction\r\n     feeling which the suffering commerce of Charleston would probably\r\n     manifest?  Would you not lose that in which your strength consists,\r\n     the union of your people?  I do not mean to imply an opinion, I\r\n     only ask the question.\r\n\r\n     \"If you could force this blockade, and bring the Government to\r\n     direct force, the feeling in Virginia would be very great.  I trust\r\n     in God it would bring her to your aid.  But it would be wrong in me\r\n     to deceive you by speaking certainly.  I cannot express the deep\r\n     mortification I have felt at her course this Winter.  But I do not\r\n     believe that the course of the Legislature is a fair expression of\r\n     popular feeling.  In the East, at least, the great majority\r\n     believes in the right of Secession, and feels the deepest sympathy\r\n     with Carolina in her opposition to measures which they regard as\r\n     she does.  But the West--Western Virginia--there is the rub!  Only\r\n     60,000 slaves to 494,000 whites!  When I consider this fact, and\r\n     the kind of argument which has been heard in this body, I cannot\r\n     but regard with the greatest fear the question whether Virginia\r\n     would assist Carolina in such an issue.\r\n\r\n     \"I must acknowledge, my dear sir, that I look to the future with\r\n     almost as much apprehension as hope.  You well object to the term\r\n     Democrat.  Democracy, in its original philosophical sense, is\r\n     indeed incompatible with Slavery and the whole system of Southern\r\n     society.  Yet, if you look back, what change will you find made in\r\n     any of your State Constitutions, or in our legislation--that is, in\r\n     its general course--for the last fifty years, which was not in the\r\n     direction of this Democracy?  Do not its principles and theories\r\n     become daily more fixed in our practice?  (I had almost said in the\r\n     opinions of our people, did I not remember with pleasure the great\r\n     improvement of opinion in regard to the abstract question of\r\n     Slavery).  And if such is the case, what are we to hope in the\r\n     future?  I do not hesitate to say that if the question is raised\r\n     between Carolina and the Federal Government, and the latter\r\n     prevails, the last hope of republican government, and, I fear, of\r\n     Southern civilization, is gone.  Russia will then be a better\r\n     government than ours.\r\n\r\n     \"I fear that the confusion and interruptions amid which I write\r\n     have made this rather a rambling letter.

TRESCOT, ESQ.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning's New York herald, in its Charleston dispatch of April 12,\r\nannounced to the World that \"The first shot [fired at Fort Sumter] from\r\nStevens's battery was fired by the venerable Edmund Ruffin, of\r\nVirginia,\" and added, \"That ball will do more for the cause of\r\nSecession, in Virginia, than volumes of stump speeches.\"\r\n\r\n\"Soon,\" says Greeley in his History, \"the thunder of fifty heavy\r\nbreaching cannon, in one grand volley, followed by the crashing and\r\ncrumbling of brick, stone, and mortar around and above them, apprized\r\nthe little garrison that their stay must necessarily be short.\"\r\n\r\nSays an eye-witness of the bombardment: \"Shells burst with the greatest\r\nrapidity in every portion of the work, hurling the loose brick and stone\r\nin all directions, breaking the windows and setting fire to whatever\r\nwoodwork they burst against.  * * *  The firing from the batteries on\r\nCumming's Point was scattered over the whole of the gorge or rear of the\r\nFort, till it looked like a sieve.  The explosion of shells, and the\r\nquantity of deadly missiles that were hurled in every direction and at\r\nevery instant of time, made it almost certain death to go out of the\r\nlower tier of casemates, and also made the working of the barbette or\r\nupper (uncovered) guns, which contained all our heaviest metal, and by\r\nwhich alone we could throw shells, quite impossible.\r\n\r\n\"During the first day there was hardly an instant of time that there was\r\na cessation of the whizzing of balls, which were sometimes coming half a\r\ndozen at once.  There was not a portion of the work which was not taken\r\nin reverse from mortars.  * * *  During Friday, the officers' barracks\r\nwere three times set on fire by the shells and three times put out under\r\nthe most galling and destructive cannonade.\r\n\r\n\"For the fourth time, the barracks were set on fire early on Saturday\r\nmorning, and attempts were made to extinguish the flames; but it was\r\nsoon discovered that red-hot shot were being thrown into the Fort with\r\nfearful rapidity, and it became evident that it would be impossible to\r\nput out the conflagration.  The whole garrison was then set to work, or\r\nas many as could be spared, to remove the powder from the magazines,\r\nwhich was desperate work, rolling barrels of powder through the fire.  *\r\n* *  After the barracks were well on fire, the batteries directed upon\r\nFort Sumter increased their cannonading to a rapidity greater than had\r\nbeen attained before.\"\r\n\r\n\"About this time, the shells and ammunition in the upper\r\nservice-magazines exploded, scattering the tower and upper portions of\r\nthe building in every direction.  The crash of the beams, the roar of\r\nthe flames, and the shower of fragments of the Fort, with the blackness\r\nof the smoke, made the scene indescribably terrific and grand.  This\r\ncontinued for several hours.  * * * \"\r\n\r\n\"There was not a portion of the Fort where a breath of air could be got\r\nfor hours, except through a wet cloth.  The fire spread to the men's\r\nquarters on the right hand and on the left, and endangered the powder\r\nwhich had been taken out of the magazines.  The men went through the\r\nfire, and covered the barrels with wet cloths, but the danger of the\r\nFort's blowing up became so imminent that they were obliged to heave the\r\nbarrels out of the embrasures.\"\r\n\r\nMajor Anderson's official report tells the whole story briefly and well,\r\nin these words:\r\n\r\n               \"STEAMSHIP BALTIC, OFF SANDY HOOK\r\n\r\n               \"April 18, 1861, 10.30 A.M., VIA NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\"Having defended Fort Sumter for thirty-four hours, until the quarters\r\nwere entirely burnt, the main gates destroyed by fire, the gorge walls\r\nseriously injured, the magazine surrounded by flames, and its door\r\nclosed from the effects of heat; four barrels and three cartridges of\r\npowder only being available, and no provisions remaining but pork, I\r\naccepted terms of evacuation offered by General Beauregard--being the\r\nsame offered by him on the 11th inst., prior to the commencement of\r\nhostilities--and marched out of the Fort on Sunday afternoon, the 14th\r\ninstant, with colors flying and drums beating, bringing away company and\r\nprivate property, and saluting my flag with fifty guns.\r\n\r\n                         \"ROBERT ANDERSON,\r\n                    \"Major 1st Artillery, Commanding.\r\n\r\n\"HON. SIMON CAMERON,\r\n\"Secretary of War, Washington.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring all this thirty-four hours of bombardment, the South rejoiced\r\nwith exceeding great joy that the time had come for the vindication of\r\nits peculiar ideas of State and other rights, even though it be with\r\nflames and the sword.  At Charleston, the people were crazy with\r\nexultation and wine-feasting and drinking being the order of the day and\r\nnight.  But for the surrender, Fort Sumter would have been stormed that\r\nSunday night.  As it was, Sunday was turned into a day of general\r\njubilation, and while the people cheered and filled the streets, all the\r\nChurches of Charleston celebrated, with more or less devotional fervor\r\nand ceremony, the bloodless victory.\r\n\r\nAt Montgomery, the Chiefs of the Confederate Government were serenaded.\r\n\"Salvos of artillery were fired, and the whole population seemed to be\r\nin an ecstasy of triumph.\"--[McPherson's History of the Rebellion, p.\r\n114]\r\n\r\nThe Confederate Secretary of War, flushed with the success, predicted\r\nthat the Confederate flag \"will, before the first of May, float over the\r\ndome of the old Capitol at Washington\" and \"will eventually float over\r\nFaneuil Hall, in Boston.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Maryland to Mexico, the protests of Union men of the South were\r\nunheard in the fierce clamor of \"On to Washington!\"\r\n\r\nThe Richmond Examiner said: \"There never was half the unanimity among\r\nthe people before, nor a tithe of the zeal upon any subject, that is now\r\nmanifested to take Washington.  From the mountain tops and valleys to\r\nthe shores of the sea, there is one wild shout of fierce resolve to\r\ncapture Washington City at all and every human hazard.\"\r\n\r\nSo also, the Mobile Advertiser enthusiastically exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"We are prepared to fight, and the enemy is not.  Now is the time for\r\naction, while he is yet unprepared.  Let the fife sound 'Gray Jackets\r\nover the Border,' and let a hundred thousand men, with such arms as they\r\ncan snatch, get over the border as quickly as they can.  Let a division\r\nenter every Northern border State, destroy railroad connection to\r\nprevent concentration of the enemy, and the desperate strait of these\r\nStates, the body of Lincoln's country, will compel him to a peace--or\r\ncompel his successor, should Virginia not suffer him to escape from his\r\ndoomed capital.\"\r\n\r\nIt was on Friday morning, the 12th of April, as we have seen, that the\r\nfirst Rebel shot was fired at Fort Sumter.  It was on Saturday afternoon\r\nand evening that the terms of surrender were agreed to, and on Sunday\r\nafternoon that the Federal flag was saluted and hauled down, and the\r\nsurrender completed.  On Monday morning, being the 15th of April, in all\r\nthe great Northern Journals of the day appeared the following:\r\n\r\n\"PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\"WHEREAS, the laws of the United States have been for some time past,\r\nand now are, opposed, and the execution thereof obstructed, in the\r\nStates of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi,\r\nLouisiana, and Texas, by Combinations too powerful to be suppressed by\r\nthe ordinary course of Judicial proceedings, or by the powers vested in\r\nthe Marshals by law; now, therefore I, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the\r\nUnited States, in virtue of the power in me vested by the Constitution\r\nand the laws, have thought fit to call forth, and hereby do call forth,\r\nthe Militia of the several States of the Union to the aggregate number\r\nof 75,000, in order to suppress said Combinations, and to cause the laws\r\nto be duly executed.\r\n\r\n\"The details for this object will be immediately communicated to the\r\nState authorities through the War Department.  I appeal to all loyal\r\ncitizens to favor, facilitate, and aid this effort to maintain the\r\nhonor, the integrity, and existence of our National Union, and the\r\nperpetuity of popular government, and to redress wrongs already long\r\nenough endured.  I deem it proper to say that the first service assigned\r\nto the forces hereby called forth, will probably be to repossess the\r\nforts, places, and property which have been seized from the Union; and\r\nin every event the utmost care will be observed, consistently with the\r\nobjects aforesaid, to avoid any devastation, any destruction of, or\r\ninterference with, property, or any disturbance of peaceful citizens of\r\nany part of the Country; and I hereby command the persons composing the\r\nCombinations aforesaid, to disperse and retire peaceably to their\r\nrespective abodes, within twenty days from this date.\r\n\r\n\"Deeming that the present condition of public affairs presents an\r\nextraordinary occasion, I do hereby, in virtue of the power in me vested\r\nby the Constitution, convene both Houses of Congress.  The Senators and\r\nRepresentatives are, therefore, summoned to assemble at their respective\r\nchambers at twelve o'clock, noon, on Thursday, the 4th day of July next,\r\nthen and there to consider and determine such measures as, in their\r\nwisdom, the public safety and interest may seem to demand.\r\n\r\n\"In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n\"Done at the city of Washington, this fifteenth day of April, in the\r\nyear of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, and of the\r\nindependence of the United States the eighty-fifth.\r\n\r\n\"By the President:  ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\"WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile in the North the official responses to this Call for troops were\r\nprompt and patriotic, in the Border and Slave States, not yet in\r\nRebellion, they were anything but encouraging.\r\n\r\nThe reply of Governor Burton, of Delaware, was by the issue of a\r\nproclamation \"recommending the formation of volunteer companies for the\r\nprotection of the lives and property of the people of Delaware against\r\nviolence of any sort to which they may be exposed; the companies not\r\nbeing subject to be ordered by the Executive into the United States\r\nservice--the law not vesting him with such authority--but having the\r\noption of offering their services to the General Government for the\r\ndefense of its capital and the support of the Constitution and laws of\r\nthe Country.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Hicks, of Maryland, in like manner, issued a proclamation for\r\nMaryland's quota of the troops, but stated that her four regiments would\r\nbe detailed to serve within the limits of Maryland--or, for the defense\r\nof the National Capital.\r\n\r\nGovernor Letcher, of Virginia, replied: \"The militia of Virginia will\r\nnot be furnished to the powers at Washington for any such use or purpose\r\nas they have in view.  Your object is to subjugate the Southern States,\r\nand a requisition made upon me for such an object--an object, in my\r\njudgment, not within the purview of the Constitution or the Act of 1795\r\n--will not be complied with.  You have chosen to inaugurate Civil War,\r\nand having done so, we will meet it in a spirit as determined as the\r\nAdministration has exhibited toward the South.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Ellis, of North Carolina, replied to Secretary Cameron: \"Your\r\ndispatch is received, and, if genuine--which its extraordinary character\r\nleads me to doubt--I have to say in reply that I regard the levy of\r\ntroops made by the Administration, for the purpose of subjugating the\r\nStates of the South, as in violation of the Constitution and a\r\nusurpation of power.  I can be no party to this wicked violation of the\r\nlaws of the country, and to this War upon the liberties of a free\r\npeople.  You can get no troops from North Carolina.  I will reply more\r\nin detail when your Call is received by mail.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Magoffin, of Kentucky, replied: \"Your dispatch is received.  In\r\nanswer I say emphatically, Kentucky will furnish no troops for the\r\nwicked purpose of subduing her sister Southern States.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Harris, of Tennessee, replied: \"Tennessee will not furnish a\r\nsingle man for Coercion, but fifty thousand, if necessary, for the\r\nDefense of our rights or those of our Southern brethren.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Jackson, of Missouri, replied: \"Your requisition is illegal,\r\nunconstitutional, revolutionary, inhuman, diabolical and cannot be\r\ncomplied with.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Rector, of Arkansas, replied: \"None will be furnished.  The\r\ndemand is only adding insult to injury.\"\r\n\r\nDiscouraging and even insulting as were most of these replies, the\r\nresponses of the Governors of the Free States were, on the other hand,\r\nfull of the ring of true martial Patriotism evoked by the fall of Sumter\r\nand the President's first call for troops.  Twenty millions of Northern\r\nhearts were stirred by that Call, as they had never before been stirred.\r\nParty and faction became for the moment, a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nThe Governors of the Free States made instant proclamation for\r\nvolunteers, and the People responded not by thousands but by hundreds of\r\nthousands.  New York, the Empire State, by her Governor and her\r\nLegislature placed all her tremendous resources at the service of the\r\nUnion; and the great State of Pennsylvania, through Governor Curtin, did\r\nthe same.  Nor were the other States at all behind.\r\n\r\nThe Loyal North felt that Law, Order, Liberty, the existence of the\r\nNation itself was in peril, and must be both saved and vindicated.  Over\r\nhalf a million of men--from the prairies of the West and the hills and\r\ncities of the East--from farms and counting houses, from factories and\r\nmines and workshops--sprang to arms at the Call, and begged to be\r\nenrolled.  The merchants and capitalists throughout the North proffered\r\nto the Government their wealth and influence and best services.  The\r\npress and the people responded as only the press and people of a Free\r\nland can respond--with all their heart and soul.  \"Fort Sumter,\" said\r\none of the journals, \"is lost, but Freedom is saved.  Henceforth, the\r\nLoyal States are a unit in uncompromising hostility to Treason, wherever\r\nplotted, however justified.  Fort Sumter is temporarily lost, but the\r\nCountry is saved.  Live the Republic!\"\r\n\r\nThis, in a nutshell, was the feeling everywhere expressed, whether by\r\nthe great crowds that marched through the streets of Northern cities\r\nwith drums beating and banners flying--cheering wildly for the Union,\r\nsinging Union songs, and compelling those of doubtful loyalty to throw\r\nout to the breeze from their homes the glorified Stars and Stripes--by\r\nthe great majority of newspapers--by the pulpit, by the rostrum, by the\r\nbench, by all of whatever profession or calling in Northern life.  For\r\nthe moment, the voice of the Rebel-sympathizer was hushed in the land,\r\nor so tremendously overborne that it seemed as if there was an absolute\r\nunanimity of love for the Union.\r\n\r\nOf course, in Border-States, bound to the South by ties of lineage and\r\nintermarriage and politics and business association, the feeling could\r\nnot be the same as elsewhere.  There, they were, so to speak, drawn both\r\nways at once, by the beckoning hands of kindred on the one side, and\r\nCountry on the other!  Thus they long waited and hesitated, praying that\r\nsomething might yet happen to save the Union of their fathers, and\r\nprevent the shedding of brothers' blood, by brothers-hoping against\r\nhope-waited, in the belief that a position of armed neutrality might be\r\npermitted to them; and grieved, when they found this could not be.\r\n\r\nEach side to the great Conflict-at-arms naturally enough believed itself\r\nright, and that the other side was the first aggressor; but the judgment\r\nof Mankind has placed the blame where it properly belonged--on the\r\nshoulders of the Rebels.  The calm, clear statement of President\r\nLincoln, in his July Message to Congress, touching the assault and its\r\npreceding history--together with his conclusions--states the whole\r\nmatter in such authentic and convincing manner that it may be said to\r\nhave settled the point beyond further controversy.  After stating that\r\nit \"was resolved to notify the Governor of South Carolina that he might\r\nexpect an attempt would be made to provision the Fort; and that if the\r\nattempt should not be resisted there would be no effort to throw in men,\r\narms, or ammunition, without further notice, or in case of an attack on\r\nthe Fort,\" Mr. Lincoln continues: \"This notice was accordingly given;\r\nwhereupon the Fort was attacked and bombarded to its fall, without even\r\nawaiting the arrival of the provisioning expedition.\"\r\n\r\nThe President then proceeds: \"It is thus seen that the assault upon and\r\nreduction of Fort Sumter was, in no sense, a matter of self-defense on\r\nthe part of the assailants.  They well knew that the garrison in the\r\nFort could, by no possibility, commit aggression upon them.  They knew\r\n--they were expressly notified--that the giving of bread to the few brave\r\nand hungry men of the garrison was all which would on that occasion be\r\nattempted, unless themselves, by resisting so much, should provoke more.\r\nThey knew that this Government desired to keep the garrison in the Fort\r\n--not to assail them--but merely to maintain visible possession, and\r\nthus to preserve the Union from actual and immediate dissolution\r\n--trusting, as hereinbefore stated, to time, discussion, and the\r\nballot-box for final adjustment; and they assailed and reduced the Fort\r\nfor precisely the reverse object--to drive out the visible authority of\r\nthe Federal Union, and thus force it to immediate dissolution.\r\n\r\n\"That this was their object, the Executive well understood; and, having\r\nsaid to them, in the Inaugural Address, 'you can have no conflict\r\nwithout being yourselves the aggressors,' he took pains not only to keep\r\nthis declaration good, but also to keep the case so free from the power\r\nof ingenious sophistry as that the World should not be able to\r\nmisunderstand it.\r\n\r\n\"By the affair at Fort Sumter, with its surrounding circumstances, that\r\npoint was reached.  Then and thereby the assailants of the Government\r\nbegan the Conflict of arms, without a gun in sight or in expectancy to\r\nreturn their fire, save only the few in the Fort sent to that harbor\r\nyears before for their own protection, and still ready to give that\r\nprotection in whatever was lawful.  In this act, discarding all else,\r\nthey have forced upon the Country, the distinct issue: 'Immediate\r\ndissolution or blood.'\r\n\r\n\"And this issue embraces more than the fate of these United States.  It\r\npresents to the whole family of Man the question whether a\r\nConstitutional Republic or Democracy--a government of the People by the\r\nsame People--can or cannot maintain its territorial integrity against\r\nits own domestic foes.  It presents the question whether discontented\r\nindividuals, too few in numbers to control administration according to\r\norganic law in any case, can always, upon the pretences made in this\r\ncase, or on any other pretences, or arbitrarily without any pretence,\r\nbreak up their Government, and thus practically put an end to free\r\ngovernment upon the earth.  It forces us to ask: 'Is there in all\r\nrepublics, this inherent and fatal weakness?'  'Must a Government of\r\nnecessity be too strong for the liberties of its own people, or too weak\r\nto maintain its own existence?'\r\n\r\n\"So viewing the issue, no choice was left but to call out the War power\r\nof the Government; and so to resist force, employed for its destruction,\r\nby force, for its preservation.\"\r\n\r\nThe Call for Troops was made, as we have seen, on the 15th day of April.\r\nOn the evening of the following day several companies of a Pennsylvania\r\nRegiment reported for duty in Washington.  On the 18th, more\r\nPennsylvania Volunteers, including a company of Artillery, arrived\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of April, the Sixth Massachusetts Regiment--whose progress\r\nthrough New York city had been triumphal-was suddenly and unexpectedly\r\nassailed, in its passage through Baltimore, to the defense of the\r\nNational Capital, by a howling mob of Maryland Secessionists--worked up\r\nto a pitch of States-rights frenzy by Confederate emissaries and\r\ninfluential Baltimore Secession-sympathizers, by news of the sudden\r\nevacuation of the Federal Arsenal at Harper's Ferry, and other exciting\r\ntidings--and had to fight its way through, leaving three soldiers of\r\nthat regiment dead, and a number wounded, behind it.\r\n\r\n     [At a meeting of the \"National Volunteer Association,\" at Monument\r\n     Square, Baltimore, the previous evening, says Greeley's History of\r\n     the American Conflict, page 462, \"None of the speakers directly\r\n     advocated attacks on the Northern troops about to pass through the\r\n     city; but each was open in his hostility to 'Coercion,' and\r\n     ardently exhorted his hearers to organize, arm and drill, for the\r\n     Conflict now inevitable.  Carr (Wilson C. N. Carr) said: 'I do not\r\n     care how many Federal troops are sent to Washington; they will soon\r\n     find themselves surrounded by such an army from Virginia and\r\n     Maryland, that escape to their homes will be impossible; and when\r\n     the 75,000 who are intended to invade the South shall have polluted\r\n     that soil with their touch, the South will exterminate and sweep\r\n     them from the Earth.' (Frantic cheering and yelling).  The meeting\r\n     broke up with stentorian cheers for 'the South' and for 'President\r\n     Davis.\"']\r\n\r\nTen companies of Philadelphia troops, reaching Baltimore at the same\r\ntime, unarmed, were also violently assailed by the crazy mob, and, after\r\na two hours' fight, reached the cars and returned to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nWashington City--already, by the Secession of Virginia, cut off from the\r\nSouth--was thus practically cut off from the North as well; and to\r\nisolate it more completely, the telegraph wires were cut down and the\r\nrailroad bridges burned.  A mere handful of regulars, the few volunteers\r\nthat had got through before the outbreak in Baltimore, and a small\r\nnumber of Union residents and Government department clerks--these, under\r\nGeneral Winfield Scott, constituted the paltry force that, for ten days\r\nafter the Call for troops, held the National Capital.\r\n\r\nInformed, as the Rebels must have been, by their swarming spies, of the\r\nweakness of the Federal metropolis, it seems absolutely marvelous that\r\ninstant advantage was not taken of it.\r\n\r\nThe Richmond Examiner, of April 23d, said: \"The capture of Washington\r\nCity is perfectly within the power of Virginia and Maryland, if Virginia\r\nwill only make the effort with her constituted authorities; nor is there\r\na single moment to lose.  * * *  The fanatical yell for the immediate\r\nsubjugation of the whole South is going up hourly from the united voices\r\nof all the North; and, for the purpose of making their work sure, they\r\nhave determined to hold Washington City as the point whence to carry on\r\ntheir brutal warfare.  Our people can take it--they will take it--and\r\nScott, the arch-traitor, and Lincoln, the Beast, combined, cannot\r\nprevent it.  The just indignation of an outraged and deeply injured\r\npeople will teach the Illinois Ape to repeat his race and retrace his\r\njourney across the borders of the Free Negro States still more rapidly\r\nthan he came.  * * *  Great cleansing and purification are needed and\r\nwill be given to that festering sink of iniquity, that wallow of Lincoln\r\nand Scott--the desecrated city of Washington; and many indeed will be\r\nthe carcasses of dogs and caitiff that will blacken the air upon the\r\ngallows before the great work is accomplished.  So let it be!\"\r\n\r\nBut despite all this fanfaronade of brutal bluster, and various\r\nmovements that looked somewhat threatening, and this complete isolation\r\nfor more than a week from the rest of the World, the city of Washington\r\nwas not seized by the Rebels, after all.\r\n\r\nThis nervous condition of affairs, however, existed until the 25th--and\r\nto General Benjamin F. Butler is due the chief credit of putting an end\r\nto it.  It seems he had reached the Susquehanna river at Perryville,\r\nwith his Eighth Massachusetts Regiment on the 20th--the day after the\r\nSixth Massachusetts had been mobbed at Baltimore--and, finding his\r\nfurther progress to Washington via Baltimore, barred by the destruction\r\nof the bridge across the Susquehanna, etc., he at once seized a large\r\nferry steamer, embarked his men on her, steamed down the river and\r\nChesapeake Bay to Annapolis, the capital of Maryland, took possession of\r\nthe frigate Constitution, the Naval Academy, and the city itself,\r\ngathered supplies, and being reinforced by the arrival by water of the\r\nfamous New York Seventh, and other regiments, repaired the branch\r\nrailroad to Annapolis Junction (on the main line of railroad between\r\nBaltimore and Washington), and transferred his column from thence, by\r\ncars, on the 25th, to the National Capital--soon thereafter also taking\r\nmilitary possession of Baltimore, which gave no further trouble to the\r\nUnion Cause.  In the meantime, however, other untoward events to that\r\nCause had happened.\r\n\r\nTwo days after the Call for troops, the Virginia Convention (April 17th)\r\nsecretly voted to Secede from the Union.  An expedition of Virginia\r\ntroops was almost at once started to capture the Federal Arsenal at\r\nHarper's Ferry, which, as has already been intimated, was evacuated\r\nhastily on the night of the 18th, by the handful of Union regulars\r\ngarrisoning it, after a futile effort to destroy the public property and\r\nstores it held.  Another expedition was started to seize the Federal\r\nNavy Yard at Norfolk--a rich prize, containing as it did, between 2,000\r\nand 3,000 pieces of heavy ordnance (300 of them Dahlgrens), three old\r\nline-of-battle ships and a number of frigates, including the Cumberland\r\nand the fine forty-gun steam frigate Merrimac, together with thousands\r\nof kegs of powder and immense stores of other munitions of war, and\r\nsupplies--that had cost in all some $10,000,000.  Without an enemy in\r\nsight, however, this fine Navy Yard was shamefully evacuated, after\r\npartly scuttling and setting fire to the vessels--the Cumberland alone\r\nbeing towed away--and spiking the guns, and doing other not very\r\nmaterial damage.\r\n\r\nSo also, in North Carolina, Rebel influence was equally active.  On the\r\n20th of April Governor Ellis seized the Federal Branch Mint at,\r\nCharlotte, and on the 22d the Federal Arsenal at Fayetteville.  A few\r\ndays thereafter his Legislature authorized him to tender to Virginia\r\n--which had already joined the Confederacy--or to the Government of the\r\nConfederate States itself, the volunteer forces of North Carolina.  And,\r\nalthough at the end of January the people of that State had decided at\r\nthe polls that no Secession Convention be held, yet the subservient\r\nLegislature did not hesitate, on demand, to call one together which met\r\nin May and ordained such Secession.\r\n\r\nThus, by the end of May, 1861, the Confederacy had grown to comprise\r\nnine instead of seven States, and the Confederate troops were\r\nconcentrating on Richmond--whither the Rebel Government was soon to\r\nremove, from Montgomery.\r\n\r\nBy this time also not only had the ranks of the regular Union Army been\r\nfilled and largely added to, but 42,000 additional volunteers had been\r\ncalled out by President Lincoln; and the blockade of the Southern ports\r\n(including those of Virginia and North Carolina) that had been\r\nproclaimed by him, was, despite all obstacles, now becoming effectual\r\nand respected.\r\n\r\nWashington City and its suburbs, by the influx of Union volunteers, had\r\nduring this month become a vast armed camp; the Potomac river had been\r\ncrossed and the Virginia hills (including Arlington heights) which\r\noverlooked the Federal Capital, had been occupied and fortified by Union\r\ntroops; the young and gallant Colonel Ellsworth had been killed by a\r\nVirginia Rebel while pulling down a Rebel flag in Alexandria; and\r\nGeneral Benjamin F. Butler, in command at Fortress Monroe, had by an\r\ninspiration, solved one of the knottiest points confronting our armies,\r\nby declaring of three Negroes who had fled from their master so as to\r\nescape working on Rebel fortifications, that they should not be returned\r\nto that master--under the Fugitive Slave Law, as demanded by a Rebel\r\nofficer with a flag of truce--but were confiscated \"property,\" and would\r\nbe retained, as \"contraband of war.\"\r\n\r\nIt was about this time, too, that the New Orleans Picayune fell into\r\nline with other unscrupulous Rebel sheets, by gravely declaring that:\r\n\"All the Massachusetts troops now in Washington are Negroes, with the\r\nexception of two or three drummer boys.  General Butler, in command, is\r\na native of Liberia.  Our readers may recollect old Ben, the barber, who\r\nkept a shop in Poydras street, and emigrated to Liberia with a small\r\ncompetence.  General Butler is his son.\"  Little did the writer of that\r\nparagraph dream how soon New Orleans would crouch at the very feet of\r\nthat same General!\r\n\r\nAnd now, while the armed hosts on either side are assembling in hostile\r\narray, or resting on their arms, preliminary to the approaching fray of\r\nbattle, let us glance at the alleged causes underlying this great\r\nRebellion against the Union.",
