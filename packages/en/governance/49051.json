Branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile pursuing my studies at Andover, I am corresponding with a girl\r\nwho resides in my native city. There were girls in Providence far more\r\nbeautiful than her, (and whose parents were more affluent than hers,)\r\nfrom whom I could doubtless have selected a companion for life, but\r\nher father had been a boy with my father, and she loved me as a sister\r\nher brother, or as a fond mother loves her precious offspring. These\r\ntruths had their influence with me. Moreover, this girl had pursued\r\nme for years, and (to illustrate her devotion) if I went to a ball,\r\nshe was there. If I took my position in a cotilion, she would soon be\r\nopposite, and staring me broadly in the face, and, as we crossed over,\r\nshe would cast the most tender glances, and press my hand with deep\r\naffection. If I proposed to dance with her, her eyes would kindle with\r\nthe wildest enthusiasm. If I went to church, she would be in the next\r\npew, and enter mine, if it were not full. If I turned a corner, I often\r\nwould meet her. If I looked behind, while promenading Westminster, (the\r\nBroadway of Providence,) she would often be prancing towards me like an\r\nArabian courser. She would address letters to herself through the Post\r\nOffice, and call for them when I was at the letter delivery. If I went\r\nto a party, she would contrive to get an invitation, and a day seldom\r\npassed, when I did not see her. Juliet never loved Romeo more fervently\r\nthan she loved me. And because I knew she loved me as no virgin ever\r\nloved, I resolved to have her. All her kindred favored our union, and\r\nbefore I went to Andover, her father came, on summer evenings, to the\r\nPost Office, and conversed with me in the most friendly tones. So, in\r\nthe Autumn of 1836, I bade adieu to Andover, forever, and repaired to\r\nProvidence, and married her at her father’s. The wedding was large and\r\nmagnificent. My father obtained me a clerkship in the Rhode Island\r\nCloth Hall, but manufactures were long depressed, and its directors\r\nresolved to close its affairs, which deprived me of a situation.\r\nThe commercial desolation of 1837 was in embryo, and merchants were\r\ncurtailing, and extensive failures transpired, and clerks and mechanics\r\nwere discharged throughout the country, and my father could obtain no\r\nlucrative employment for me, and dared not establish me in business\r\nin such a frightful panic. Myself and wife resided at her father’s.\r\nI made several journeys to Boston and New York for a clerkship, but\r\nI could obtain none. The Spring of 1837 arrived. I was proud and\r\nambitious. Heartless comments were made, all over Providence, about\r\nmy idleness, and my prolonged residence with the parents of my wife.\r\nI got uneasy, and was mortified beyond expression and endurance. I\r\nmade a final passage to New York, and resolved, if I obtained no\r\nemployment, to have a crisis. I could procure no situation, and went\r\nto Philadelphia, where I was also unsuccessful. I saw an advertisement\r\nfor a clerk in Westchester, Pennsylvania, whither I repaired, but a\r\nclerk had been obtained. My means were nearly exhausted, and I strove\r\nto sell a diamond ring and gold pencil case to the barkeeper, and was\r\nsuspected as a thief, and arrested, and my trunks examined in the\r\npresence of a large crowd, who came to the Hotel from every part of the\r\ntown. I was honorably acquitted, and instantly left for Philadelphia,\r\nwhere I sold my ring and pencil case, and proceeded to New York, where\r\nI sold my watch. I now became desperate, and resolved to bring matters\r\nto an immediate consummation. I wrote a letter to father, and told him\r\nthat I was almost deranged, and besought him to save me. The banks\r\nsuspended specie payment on the day I wrote to my father, and the whole\r\ncountry was a commercial ruin. Father wrote me, that he had spent\r\nthousands of dollars for my education,—had recently paid my debts in\r\nAndover and Providence, amounting to a thousand dollars,—had let me\r\nhave large sums since my marriage,—was not worth over twenty thousand\r\ndollars,—feared he might soon be compelled to assign his property,\r\nand could obtain no clerkship for me while the money panic raged. I\r\nproceeded to New Haven, and wrote to him again, and he responded that\r\nhe would see my father-in-law, and pledge himself to meet him half-way\r\nin any proposition he might make to save me, if he sacrificed his last\r\ndollar. I went to Norwich, and wrote him again, and he informed me that\r\nhe had seen my father-in-law, who declined to aid me to the extent\r\nof a penny, and said that I must effect my salvation in my own way.\r\nAlthough my father-in-law was worth several hundred thousand dollars,\r\nhe had let me have but twenty-five dollars before or since my marriage,\r\nand when he placed this amount in my hand, he sneeringly exclaimed: “I\r\nalways like to help the unfortunate.” In view of all this, I loathed my\r\nfather-in-law, and loved my father, and wrote a fearful letter to both,\r\n(superscribing it to the former,) threatening to visit Providence,\r\nand tear their hearts out if they did not instantly relieve me. I\r\nincluded my father in this awful letter, so that my father-in-law\r\ncould not be the sole complainant against me, as I feared he would\r\nconsign me to prison for years, if possible. And I was fortunate in\r\nincluding my beloved father in my dreadful letter, as the sequel will\r\nshow. I then advanced to Scituate, about ten miles from Providence,\r\nand wrote another letter to my father and father-in-law, threatening\r\nto come to Providence on the following day, and take their lives,\r\nif they did not rescue me from my horrible dilemma. Two constables,\r\nnamed Gould and Potter, came to Scituate, and arrested me at the Hotel\r\nof Dr. Battey, (from which I had dated my letter,) and took me to\r\nProvidence in a carriage, and put me in jail as a debtor, on a debt\r\nof five hundred dollars, created for the occasion by the wisdom of my\r\nfather. My father-in-law desired to imprison me as a criminal, (as I\r\nhad anticipated,) but my father’s counsels prevailed, and I was saved\r\nfrom a felon’s doom. In those days, debtors were incarcerated, and I\r\nwas confined in a dark cell, by locks, and bars, and bolts, as all\r\nProvidence feared I would escape, and kill my father and father-in-law,\r\nand perhaps others. Their fears were supremely ridiculous, as, if I\r\nhad seriously contemplated their death, I would not have told them\r\nwhere I was in Scituate, nor the precise period that I should come to\r\nProvidence and dispatch them. But my object was attained. I meant to\r\nhave a crisis, and I got it with a vengeance on all sides. The night I\r\nentered my cell was the happiest of my life. My bed was on the floor,\r\nand rats and bugs crawled over me to their hearts’ content. I never\r\nslept more sweetly, though occasionally aroused by the enormous rats\r\nsquealing and nibbling at my nose. The privy of the prisoners in the\r\nlarge debtors’ apartment joined my cell, and the stench was almost\r\nintolerable, and yet I soon became accustomed even to that, and for\r\ndays I laughed and danced and sang as never, for I had emerged from\r\nanxiety and torture approximating purgatory itself. Mr. Parker, a\r\ndebtor, soon joined me in my cell, and we played cards, and narrated\r\nour curious experience, and had a merry time; but Parker obtained\r\nhis liberty, and I was again alone, and I soon got melancholy, and\r\nI wept bitterly over the calamities of my beloved wife, through her\r\npenurious and demon father. In three weeks I was permitted the freedom\r\nof the jail, which imparted perfect bliss to my disconsolate mind. I\r\nreviewed my classics and mathematics in prison, and some faithful\r\ncompanions called, and time again passed merrily. In six weeks my\r\nfather came, and (as my only complainant) effected my discharge, by\r\nwithdrawing his fictitious suit for debt against me. He accompanied\r\nme in a carriage to the steamboat, and gave me money, with his most\r\naffectionate blessing, and I departed for New York, an outcast, in\r\ncompany with a dear relative named Franklin Cooley, who had been very\r\nkind to me during my entire confinement, and through all my days. I\r\nleft my benefactor in New York, and departed for Albany, and went to\r\nmy Aunt Lucy’s, whom I had not seen for ten years, who resided in the\r\ntown of Groveland, near Geneseo, in Livingston County, in the State\r\nof New York. My grandfather, on the mother’s side, left Connecticut\r\nforty years ago, in consequence of extreme melancholy, after his\r\nwife’s demise, and buried himself in the wilderness of Groveland, and\r\nwrote to none of his kindred for twenty years. He first worked on a\r\nfarm, and as the country became more populous, he taught school and\r\nrealized enough to buy him a farm from the famous Mr. Wadsworth, whom\r\nhe knew in youth in Connecticut. At the expiration of twenty years, he\r\nwrote to East Hartford, Ct., and his surviving daughter, Lucy, with\r\nher husband, a drunken and cruel vagabond, went to Groveland, and in\r\nabout five years after their arrival, my grandfather died, and Aunt\r\nLucy and her husband coaxed him in his closing hours to leave his farm\r\nto them, which was worth about twenty thousand dollars, one-half of\r\nwhich should have reverted to my mother’s children, who were allowed\r\none dollar each, so that they could not break the will. On my arrival,\r\nI found my aunt’s husband drunk, and she told me that he had involved\r\nthe farm in debt, which was mortgaged for a large amount, and that he\r\ntreated her like a brute. They lived in a one-story hut, consisting of\r\none room, and a pigeon-house in the roof. I arrived at midnight, in a\r\nstage coach, and as there was no house within a mile, I was compelled\r\nto stop all night, but where I was to sleep I could not divine. Aunt\r\nLucy asked me if I was prepared to retire, and responding yes, she\r\nlit a cheap candle, and led me to the rear of the hovel, and up she\r\nwent a ladder, like a squirrel, and bade me follow. On arriving at\r\nthe door of the pigeon-house, she suspended one leg to enable me to\r\npass her, and then gave me the candle, and we bade each other good\r\nnight, and I crawled in, passing through dense partitions of cobwebs,\r\nand battalions of spiders and rats, and down I lay for the night, and\r\ncounted minutes until the morning’s dawn, when I emerged from the\r\nhideous hole, in which I had nearly suffocated. I took breakfast,\r\nconsisting of pork and herring, and visited my grandfather’s grave in\r\na distant field, and departed for Geneseo in the mail coach, where I\r\nexamined my grandfather’s Will, and found that my mother’s children\r\ncould never obtain their share of his beautiful estate. I left for\r\nRochester, and departed for Albany in a canal boat, and worked a short\r\ntime in a printing office at Utica. I left for New York, and worked\r\na brief period in the job office of William A. Mercein, and went to\r\nPhiladelphia, where I worked a week, and left for Baltimore, where I\r\nfound my brother Albert, who was a compositor in the printing office\r\nof the _Baltimore Sun_, just started by Mr. Abel, (an old friend of\r\nmine,) whose editor and subsequent famous Washington correspondent\r\nwas Sylvester S. Southworth. [Mr. Abel is a native of Warren, Rhode\r\nIsland, and established the _Philadelphia Ledger_ after the _Baltimore\r\nSun_. In earlier years, Mr. Abel and myself often worked side by side\r\nas compositors in Providence, Boston, and New York.] I worked a few\r\ndays in Baltimore, and arrived in Washington just prior to the extra\r\nSession of Congress in 1837, and obtained a situation in the job office\r\nof Gales & Seaton, through the influence of their bookkeeper, Levi\r\nBoots, who was a room-mate of mine when I worked and boarded with Wm.\r\nGreer, of the _Washington Globe_, during my residence in Washington\r\nin 1830. I got $10 a week at Gales & Seaton’s, and soon entered\r\nColumbian College, which was located nearly two miles from Washington,\r\nwhose worthy President was Mr. Chapin. I studied nights, and recited\r\nprivately with Professors Ruggles and Chaplin, at daylight, and took\r\nbreakfast with the students, and left for Gales & Seaton’s with bread\r\nand cold meat, in a little basket, for my dinner, and, after working\r\nall day, returned to Columbian College at sunset. These were the\r\nglorious days of the American Senate, and I was enchanted with Clay,\r\nCalhoun, Webster, Benton, Preston, Crittenden, Buchanan, and others,\r\nwhose eloquence and anathema against the public robbers, were equal\r\nto the philippics of Cicero and Demosthenes against the scoundrels of\r\ntheir respective countries. The House of Representatives was full of\r\nduelists, tigers, monkeys, screech-owls, and wild-cats, who formed\r\na perfect menagerie. I heard the exciting debate that led to poor\r\nCilley’s immolation, and attended his funeral, whose exercises were\r\nthe most imposing I ever witnessed. I saw the unearthly Calhoun in the\r\nmournful procession, as it moved from the Capitol, whose brilliant eyes\r\nreflected the profoundest sorrow. I studiously avoided my old friend\r\nCausin, as I did not wish to see him after my terrible reversion of\r\nfortune. But we met by chance in the Rotunda of the Capitol, and when\r\nI related my sad story, he was deeply affected. We met again, and he\r\nseemed quite friendly, but the charm was broken, and our enthusiastic\r\nfriendship soon became a matter of oblivion. I now receive a letter\r\nfrom William Augustus White, (dated Burlington, Vt.,) with whom I was\r\nintimate in Andover, while I was a member of Phillips’ Academy, and\r\nwhile I studied under private teachers. Young White wrote me that the\r\nMassachusetts Education Society undertook his education, but it had\r\nfailed during the bankruptcy of 1837, and he was at the College at\r\nBurlington, Vt., and knew not what to do, and solicited funds to enable\r\nhim to join me in Washington. I told his story to the President and\r\nProfessors and students of Columbian College, and to Gales & Seaton,\r\nand to Mr. Gronard, the generous foreman of the job office, and other\r\nliberal gentlemen, who contributed money that I forwarded to White,\r\nand he came to Washington, where I obtained him a situation with Mr.\r\nAbbott, who had a Classical Academy near the President’s. White roomed\r\nwith me at Columbian College until 1839, when I became so ill, that I\r\nwas compelled to relinquish my studies. My blood rushed fearfully to\r\nthe brain, and I was so nervous, that I imagined if I spoke beyond a\r\nwhisper, that I would break a blood vessel. I also thought if I ate\r\nsolid food, I would have the cholic as soon as it entered my belly. Dr.\r\nThomas Sewell, of Washington, came out to the College, and the students\r\nand professors gathered around my bed, and I thought I was about\r\nto die, when the Doctor, (after punching my belly rather roughly,)\r\nexclaimed: “Why, Branch, you are not dangerously ill, and you could\r\nnot die, if you wanted to, without suicide. You are only nervous and\r\ndyspeptic, and you remind me of a nervous person recently described in\r\nan eminent British periodical, who imagined that he had glass legs,\r\nand that, if he attempted to walk, they would snap like pipe stems.\r\nHe made his friends dress him, and carry him about the house for a\r\nlong period, until he nearly wore them out, and they resolved to do\r\nit no longer; and believing that he could walk as well as they, they\r\ndetermined to try an experiment. So, they asked him if he would like to\r\ntake a ride into the country. He said he would, if they would put him\r\nin the carriage. They first placed masks, torches, horns, and Indian\r\napparel in a trunk, and placed him in the carriage, and off they drove,\r\narriving in a deep wood before sunset, and asked him if he would get\r\nout, and sit on the grass. He said he would, if they would take him\r\nout. They carefully took him out, and seated him on the grass, and then\r\ngot into the carriage, saying that they were going back to London, and\r\nthat, if he accompanied them, he must get into the carriage himself,\r\nwhich he assured them he could not do, without breaking his glass legs.\r\nSo, off they drive, amid his frantic cries to take him with them. In\r\nabout two hours, a thunder storm arose, and four of them, in their\r\nfrightful disguises, rapidly approached him, (amid rain, thunder, and\r\nlightning,) all masked and attired like devils and wild Indians, and\r\nmade the woods ring with drums, and horns, and bagpipes. He sat firmly\r\nuntil they were about to inclose, and apparently devour him, when he\r\nsprang to his feet, and ran so fleetly on his supposed glass legs, that\r\nthey pursued him for half a mile, and gave up the contest. They then\r\nrepaired to their carriage, and although they drove tolerably fast,\r\nyet, when they arrived at their home in London, they found him sitting\r\nquietly in his easy chair, as though nothing had transpired, his fancy\r\nglass legs having distanced the fleetest horses.” I had not laughed\r\nfor two months, but Dr. Sewell’s funny and truthful story made all the\r\nstudents, and President, and professors roar, and I had to join them\r\nagainst my will. When they all retired, I arose from my bed, for the\r\nfirst time in ten days, and dressed and shaved myself, and raised my\r\nvoice far beyond a whisper, and in one hour talked in my usual tone,\r\nand called for some beef steak, of which I ate quite heartily, and\r\nfound that my nerves had bamboozled me most shamefully, and I recovered\r\nrapidly. But I was delicate, and could not work at the printing\r\nbusiness, and my blood concentrated in the brain, and I had to cease\r\nmy severe mental application, and I resolved to return to my father’s\r\nin Providence as the prodigal son. Young White accompanied me to my\r\nfather’s door, and told my mournful story, when my father embraced me\r\nwith his wonted affection, after an absence of nearly three years.\r\n\r\n(To be continued to our last moan.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen H. Branch’s Alligator.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, SATURDAY, JUNE 5, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the seventh week of the ALLIGATOR, and nearly every editor in\r\nthis city has had the courtesy, and kindness, and generosity to notice\r\nmy efforts to establish a journal on the basis of truth and justice,\r\nsave James Gordon Bennett, Horace Greeley, and Henry J. Raymond. As\r\nI have written for the _Herald_, _Tribune_, and _Times_ nearly since\r\ntheir birth, the premeditated slight of Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond\r\nseems so impolite and unkind and ungenerous, that I have resolved to\r\nanalyse the editorial career of these notorious big and little villains\r\nof the press, who are a greater curse to the people of this country\r\nthan all the thieves who ever entered the City Hall, or our State or\r\nNational Capitols. And next week I will begin their dissection, and\r\npluck out their livers, and cast them to the cadaverous and greedy\r\nvultures for a choice repast, which will present the novel spectacle\r\nof thievish crows devouring the livers of their own species. It is the\r\ncustom of these editors to unite and crush those who dare oppose them,\r\nand expose their crimes, by refusing to let the wholesale newspaper\r\nvenders have the _Herald_, _Tribune_, and _Times_, if they sell the\r\npublic journals of their adversaries. If they strive to deprive me of\r\nbread, by intimidating the wholesale newspaper dealers of Ann, Nassau,\r\nand Beekman streets, so help me God, I will enter their editorial\r\nclosets, and lash them until the blood streams from every pore, if I\r\nam slain in the attempt. Next week, then, and as long as I can wield a\r\npen, I will show the people of this country how these editors blow hot\r\nand cold, and black mail, and collude with thievish politicians, and\r\nshare their spoils, and _sell the people_! And from my knowledge of\r\nBennett, Greeley, and Raymond (after a close communion with them for\r\ntwenty years,) I brand them as three of the biggest villains that ever\r\nbreathed. So, next week, let the American people prepare for startling\r\nrevelations!\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES R. WHITING is a man whose head commands our profoundest respect,\r\nand his heart our warmest attachment. This is no age for him. He is\r\nlike a cat in a strange garret among the Busteeds, and Connollys,\r\nand Pursers, and Devlins, and Smiths, and Erbens, and other perjured\r\naliens and plunderers that prowl around the City Treasury. But James\r\nR. Whiting would have been adored in the halcyon or tumultuous days\r\nof the Persian, Egyptian, Grecian, or Roman Empires. But neither the\r\npress nor the people will ever appreciate his wisdom, patriotism, and\r\nsacrifice in these degenerate times. God bless James R. Whiting! and\r\nwhen he dies, the honest people will weep over his departure, as the\r\nAthenians did over the bones of Socrates, whom they kicked, and cuffed,\r\nand taunted with insanity, and accused of corrupting the youth of his\r\ncountry, and thrust poison down his throat, but they deeply regretted\r\ntheir folly and cruelty, and the Grecians of every age have mourned\r\nhis melancholy fate, and cursed their ancestors for their neglect\r\nand persecution of the scholar and patriot, and unrivalled Father of\r\nPhilosophers, since the globe was launched into the atmospheric waves.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter Cooper’s Avarice and Infernal Antecedents.\r\n\r\nWe all know how John Jacob Astor and Stephen Girard got their first\r\nthousand dollars. And now let us see how Peter Cooper obtained his\r\nfirst fifteen hundred dollars. When quite young and penniless, the\r\nAmerican Government owed Peter Cooper’s aunt fifteen hundred dollars,\r\nas pension money, which Peter long besought his aunt to let him\r\nstrive to obtain, and she invested him with the power to collect it,\r\nand he soon obtained it without much difficulty through some of the\r\nvagabond politicians of those days, for whom he had done some dirty\r\nwork in securing their election to Congress and other civil trusts.\r\nOn obtaining the money, Peter requested the parties who got it for\r\nhim never to disclose it, and they promised they would not. After he\r\ngot it, Peter would often visit his sick and needy and aged aunt, and\r\nassure her that he had not obtained it, nor would he ever be able\r\nto force the Government to pay her. One evening a friend called on\r\nPeter’s aunt, (who had been absent in a foreign land,) and found her\r\nvery ill, and in the last stages of poverty, having sold or pawned\r\nnearly all she had. On perceiving this sad state of her affairs, he\r\nexclaimed: “Why, my good lady, how could you so rapidly squander the\r\nfifteen hundred dollars, with interest, that Peter Cooper obtained\r\nfor you from our Government, as the pension due you for the patriotic\r\nservices of your illustrious kindred?” She slowly raised her skeleton\r\nform from the bed, and reclining on her hands and side, she said in a\r\nhusky and feeble tone: “My dear nephew, Peter Cooper, has often told\r\nme that my claim is invalid, and that I can never obtain a cent.” Her\r\nfriend then started from his chair, and shook her hand, and kissed\r\nit, and told her to be of good cheer, and rushed from the house, and\r\nwas on his way to Washington in one hour, and soon returned to New\r\nYork with a letter from the President of the United States, (who knew\r\nher husband in his early years,) affectionately assuring her that her\r\nclaim was paid to Peter Cooper, as her accredited agent and nephew.\r\nGreat mental excitement and a protracted and dangerous illness followed\r\nthese painful disclosures, during which Peter did not visit her.\r\nAfter she partially recovered, she instituted a suit against Peter,\r\nwhich he resisted through all the Courts for sixteen years, when the\r\nCourt of Appeals directed Peter to pay his aunt four thousand and\r\nfive hundred dollars. The instant Peter heard of the Court’s fatal\r\ndecision, he mounted a fleet horse and reached his aunt’s at midnight,\r\nand approached her with these sweet words: “O, my dear aunt, how do\r\nyou do? I am so glad to see you. I declare, how well and young you\r\nlook for one so old as you. Well, my dear aunt, I have come to pay you\r\nthe money I owe you, which I have kept all this time, and opposed you\r\nfor sixteen years in the Courts, simply because I feared if I let you\r\nhave it, somebody would get it away from you, and you would then be\r\npoor and penniless in your declining years.—Now, my dear aunt, I do\r\nassure you that I always intended to let you have the money; but your\r\nmemory was so very bad, and you were always so charitable and easily\r\ninfluenced, that I thought I could take care of your money much better\r\nthan you, and so I have always kept it against my will, and solely for\r\nyour good. And now, dear aunt, I have written a receipt for you to\r\nsign, and if you will just take this pen, and sign it, you can have all\r\nthis money in gold that you see in my handkerchief, which will keep you\r\ncomfortable all your days.” And the poor old infirm creature tottered\r\nto the table, and put on her spectacles, and signed a receipt with her\r\nskeleton and trembling hand, for two thousand dollars, in full of all\r\ndemands against Peter Cooper, which the unparalleled villain had thus\r\ncunningly written to defraud her of the balance of two thousand and\r\nfive hundred dollars, which the Court of Appeals had directed him to\r\npay her, after sixteen years of obstinate and wicked litigation on his\r\npart. He then gave her two thousand dollars, and left her as a robber\r\ndarts from a habitation when its tenant is after him with a dagger or\r\nrevolver. She threatened to prosecute him for obtaining $2,500 through\r\nfalse pretences, and he dared her to do it. But she descended from\r\npatriotic blood, and was so excited and exasperated at his wrongs, and\r\ndisgusted with her species and modern kindred, and being superannuated\r\nand broken-hearted, and literally worn out, that, while sitting in her\r\nbed dictating a letter to the President of the United States respecting\r\nthe monstrous robberies of Peter Cooper, she fell back and expired,\r\nwith her withering execrations of her nephew on her lips. And it was\r\nthe belief of the most eminent jurists of those days, that her sudden\r\ndemise saved Peter Cooper from a residence of ten years in the dungeons\r\nof the State.\r\n\r\nPeter Cooper has long bamboozled this city and country with his bogus\r\nphilanthropy. He has not, and never will surrender his right, nor that\r\nof his heirs, to the building bearing the imposing inscription of\r\n“Union” and “To Science and Art.” He will let the first four stories,\r\nand pocket the rent, but the fifth story being (like the upper story\r\nof the Wall street buildings,) almost valueless, and which he could\r\nhardly let at all, he designs devoting to human learning, by letting\r\nit to itinerating lecturers for as much as he can squeeze out of them,\r\nand put that in his pocket also. And from my knowledge of his narrow\r\nmind, (he having been my Grammar pupil in his old age,) I do not\r\nbelieve that he will ever let the fifth story of his bogus scientific\r\nedifice to any lecturer who differs with his political or religious\r\nviews. The penurious old rascal has furnished the immortal “Union” and\r\n“Science” and “Art” fifth story with the dilapidated and wormy benches\r\nof the old Wash Tub Tabernacle, and of Dr. Spring’s old brick church,\r\nwhich were too much decayed for a wholesome and patriotic or political\r\nbonfire. By all his noise and imposture about devoting his building\r\nto “Union, Science, and Art,” he has succeeded in prohibiting the\r\nconstruction of an edifice (on the vacant square at the junction of the\r\nThird and Fourth Avenues) far more beautiful than his, and by foiling\r\nthat project, he greatly enhanced the value of his own property. And\r\nthrough his stupendous “Union,” and “Science” and “Art” imposition, he\r\nhas cheated the New York Common Council into voting him a reduction of\r\n$8,000 worth of taxes on his building. There never was such a cunning\r\nwretch as Peter Cooper, whose craft would make the devil himself blush.\r\nThrough his pretended love of his species, and his spurious earnest\r\nregard for the culture of the youth of the present and of coming\r\ngenerations, he has foisted the merest old granny that ever existed on\r\nthe noble Metropolis as Mayor; and, not content with the Mayoralty and\r\nnearly all of the Executive Departments in his grasp, this cunning old\r\nrat directs the Mayor (who married his adopted daughter) to appoint\r\nhis (Peter’s) own son Edward as Street Commissioner, which is worth\r\nmillions in the hands of such cunning old thieves as Peter Cooper and\r\nDaniel F. Tieman, who have been stealing the public money through their\r\nenormous speculations and gigantic suburban operations, ever since they\r\nentered the Common Council in 1828. I have got the data to write a\r\nhundred pages on Peter Cooper’s indictment, while he had a glue factory\r\non the old Boston road, and his niggardly meanness to his nieces and\r\nnephews, and other kindred, and to the poor Irishmen at present in\r\nhis glue factory in the vicinity of New York. He screws down all in\r\nhis employ to such low wages, that he barely permits them to subsist,\r\nalthough their employment of skinning diseased cows feet and making\r\nglue is the most offensive labor under Heaven. For his cruelty towards\r\nan inoffensive apple-woman, (whom he seized by the throat, and dragged\r\nfrom his store, and threw into the gutter,) he should be horsewhipped\r\nfrom the Battery to Harlem. And through his artifice and eternal\r\nexcuse, (to the poor starving wretches who have solicited aid since he\r\nbegan his bogus intellectual edifice,) that he could not contribute a\r\ndollar to any charity except his building, he has saved thousands that\r\nother equally affluent citizens have contributed to relieve the sick\r\nand hungry and naked during the several winters of famine through which\r\nwe have passed, since Peter Cooper began the construction of his sham\r\nliterary institution. And these reprobates now strive to starve the\r\nsick old fathers and mothers and grandmothers and dear little brothers\r\nand sisters of the noble newsboys who sell their papers amid the rain\r\nand sleet and freezing cold, while these leprous and chronic-pile\r\nold scamps are sweetly reposing in feather beds they stole from the\r\ntax-payers, under the garb of City Reform. Peter Cooper must soon meet\r\nhis plundered aunt in the realms of shadows, whose contemplation makes\r\nhim tremble like a murderer going to execution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The Early Penury of the Three Napoleons of the American\r\n Press—Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hon. John Kelly (now Member of Congress from the city of New\r\nYork) told me that he was the first boy whom James Gordon Bennett\r\nemployed, when he issued the first number of the _Herald_,—that he\r\n(honest Johnny Kelly) was then a poor, barefooted boy, with scarcely\r\nmeans to live,—that his duties consisted in sweeping out the office,\r\nrunning errands, folding and selling the _Herald_, and in doing every\r\nthing required in and out of the office,—that Bennett then had an\r\noffice in the basement of a dilapidated building in Wall street,\r\nnear William, which was in constant danger of falling, and for which\r\nhe paid no rent,—that Anderson & Ward then published the _Herald_,\r\nwhose printing office was in Ann street, in a building subsequently\r\ndestroyed by fire, and which occupied the lot of the present _Sunday\r\nAtlas_ edifice,—that Anderson & Ward would not let Bennett have a\r\nsolitary copy of the _Herald_ until he paid for it,—that he (John)\r\nused to go every day with Bennett to Anderson & Ward’s to get the\r\n_Herald_ papers, and that Bennett often had no money, and would appeal\r\nin vain for the _Herald_,—that in tears he often pawned his watch to\r\nAnderson & Ward for the _Herald_ newspapers,—that on one occasion,\r\nhe had no money, and Anderson & Ward held his watch as security for\r\nthe preceding day’s _Heralds_, and Ward was drunk, and Anderson was\r\nabsent, and Bennett cried so long and hard that Ward finally let him\r\nhave the newspapers,—that nothing but Ward’s generosity, arising\r\nfrom his intoxication, saved Bennett on that critical occasion, as,\r\nif Ward had withheld the papers, and the _Herald_ had not appeared as\r\nusual, it might have ceased to exist, and the World have never heard of\r\nJames Gordon Bennett. And thus one event (even the whim of a drunkard)\r\noften shadows or illuminates our pathway to ceaseless adversity or\r\nprosperity, or to eternal obscurity or immortality.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Horace Greeley was so poor when he published the _New Yorker_,\r\nthat he could not pay his Wheat Bread Board, and even failed to pay\r\nhis Unbolted Wheat, or Graham Bread Board. I boarded with Mr. and Mrs.\r\nGreeley for seven years at the old Graham House in Barclay street, and\r\n(sometime after Greeley established the _Tribune_) Mrs. Greeley often\r\nborrowed money of me, from one shilling to five dollars. She always\r\npaid me, but often kept it for weeks, which subjected me to great\r\nembarrassment, as I was at the portal of starvation. But Mrs. Greeley\r\nwas a poetess, and very interesting in conversation, and a sweet and\r\ngentle lady, and extremely beautiful, and her pretty smile emitted the\r\nsolace of an angel’s wand, to a cadaverous and gloomy Grahamite like\r\nme, which was of infinite value to my digestive organs, and I never\r\ncould resist her arch persuasion to loan her money, although it was\r\noften my very last shilling. I know a printer in this city who caught\r\nGreeley in one of Simpson’s Pawn Boxes. Greeley had just pawned a\r\ncoat and silver watch, (which the printer saw dart up the spout like\r\na Fourth of July rocket,) and he, Greeley, being near-sighted, was\r\nleaning over the counter, counting the pawn money, when the printer,\r\nbeing in the next Pawn Box, (and who had worked as a journeyman printer\r\nby the side of Greeley in a printing office in Chatham street some\r\nyears before,) seized Greeley’s ear, and slapped him on the back, when\r\nGreeley looked up, and blushed profusely, and trembled from hat to\r\nboot, and picked up his money from the counter, and walked out of the\r\npawnbroker’s shop, with gigantic strides, amid the screams of Simpson\r\nand his clerks, and the printer, and all the miserable wretches\r\npresent, including the darkies. Three years afterwards, Simpson got\r\nthe boss of the printer to print some auction placards, and told him\r\nthat Greeley never redeemed his coat and watch, which were sold at a\r\nPawnbroker’s public sale.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Governor Henry J. Raymond, (soon after he came to New\r\nYork,) was the room-mate of my brother Thomas in Beekman street,\r\nnearly opposite Saint George’s Church, at the boarding house of a\r\nsuperannuated Presbyterian clergyman named Brown. Gov. Raymond told\r\nme, three weeks since, that my brother Thomas was the first person\r\nhe roomed with in New York. My brother Tommy had run away from home,\r\nand appealed to me for money, and to get him a situation. He arrived\r\nfrom Providence in a snow storm, and as Mrs. Tripler, (with whom I\r\nboarded, opposite Saint George’s Church,) was full, I got him board\r\nat Parson Brown’s, in a small dark attic room, for two dollars a\r\nweek. Two days after he began to board at Brown’s, young Mr. Raymond\r\ncame there, and Brown put him in Tommy’s apartment, where they roomed\r\nand slept together for a long period. Raymond was very short, but\r\nTom was much shorter, with the hump of King Richard on his back, but\r\nthey slept soundly, and snugly, and sweetly, and cosily, and seldom\r\nkicked or scratched each other. After Raymond came into Tom’s bed, (it\r\nwas a double, ricketty, second-hand cot,) Brown reduced Tom’s fare\r\ntwenty-five cents, which made his board one dollar and seventy-five\r\ncents a week, and even that was quite a tax on my attenuated purse.\r\nTom has often told me that he and Raymond would sometimes talk on\r\nreligion and politics until the doleful hours of midnight, and related\r\nmany funny anecdotes of Raymond, which I shall publish in the “History\r\nof my Life.” Tom said that Raymond was so poor at this time, that he\r\ncould hardly subsist, and used to have his hair cut close to the skull,\r\nto save barber’s money, and wash his handkerchiefs and stockings, and\r\nsometimes his shirts, and used to mend his shirts and stockings every\r\nSunday morning, and the room was so cold, that Raymond sat up in the\r\ncot, with his legs covered with the sheet and blanket, while he darned\r\nhis stockings and sewed the rips of his shirts, and that he, (Tom,)\r\nsuffered severely while Raymond was sitting up in the cot mending his\r\nduds, letting in the cold air on his (Tom’s) back and legs. Poor Tommy\r\nis cold now, (dying from the rheumatism and dropsy that Raymond gave\r\nhim,) and I recently bore his tiny body, and big heart, and intelligent\r\nbrain to our family tomb in Rhode Island, by whose side I may soon\r\nrepose.\r\n\r\nBennett, Greeley, and Raymond are now at the summit of the American\r\nPress, and we shall soon show that they have not been true to the\r\nchildren of the Great Being who raised them from utter penury and\r\nobscurity to their present exalted position. And we shall review the\r\nsource and rise of their Secretaries, Hudson, Dana, and Tuthill, on\r\nsome very fine day, and then we shall analyse our own mysterious\r\ncareer, and then——O me! O glass! O paint! O putty! O Cooper! O\r\nTiemann! O Edward! O Jeremiah! and the Italian Tasso!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Sweet Letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n  RAHWAY, May 15th, 1858.\r\n\r\n  STEPHEN H. BRANCH—\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir_,—Having read a great deal about you, I have taken a great\r\ninterest in you.
