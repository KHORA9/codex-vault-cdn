I must desire, that if you think fit to throw away any\r\nmoments on it, you would not do it after reading those excellent pieces\r\nwith which you are usually conversant. The images which you will meet\r\nwith here, will be very faint, after the perusal of the Greeks and\r\nRomans, who are your ordinary companions. I must confess I am obliged\r\nto you for the taste of many of their excellences, which I had not\r\nobserved until you pointed them to me. I am very proud that there are\r\nsome things in these papers which I know you pardon;[2] and it is no\r\nsmall pleasure to have one's labours suffered by the judgment of a man,\r\nwho so well understands the true charms of eloquence and poesy. But I\r\ndirect this address to you, not that I think I can entertain you with\r\nmy writings, but to thank you for the new delight I have, from your\r\nconversation, in those of other men.\r\n\r\nMay you enjoy a long continuance of the true relish of the happiness\r\nHeaven has bestowed upon you. I know not how to say a more affectionate\r\nthing to you, than to wish that you may be always what you are; and\r\nthat you may ever think, as I know you now do, that you have a much\r\nlarger fortune than you want.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir,\r\n  Your most obedient, and most humble Servant,\r\n  ISAAC BICKERSTAFF.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Edward Wortley Montagu, an intimate friend of Addison and Steele,\r\nwas the second son of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, and grandson of\r\nEdward Montagu, the first Earl of Sandwich. He was chosen a Member of\r\nParliament for Huntingdon in 1705, and in all other parliaments but\r\ntwo to the end of her reign. On the accession of George I. he became\r\none of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, and was afterwards\r\nAmbassador-Extraordinary to the Porte. He set out, January 27, 1716,\r\nand having finished his negotiations returned in 1718. In the first\r\nparliament called by King George I. he was chosen for the city of\r\nWestminster, and afterwards served for Huntingdon. He was a member for\r\nthe city of Peterborough when he died, January 22, 1761, aged 80 years,\r\nbefore he was able to alter his will, as he intended, in favour of his\r\nson. He married the famous Lady Mary Pierrepont, eldest daughter of the\r\nDuke of Kingston, in 1712, and by her he had issue an only son, Edward\r\nWortley Montagu, who was M.P. in three parliaments for Bossiney, in\r\nCornwall; and a daughter Mary, married to John Stuart, Earl of Bute,\r\nAugust 24, 1736.\r\n\r\n[2] There is no doubt that Wortley Montagu contributed papers and hints\r\nfor the _Tatler_ (\"Letters of Lady M. W. Montagu,\" ed. Moy Thomas, i.\r\n5, 10, 62). See specially No. 223.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TATLER\r\n\r\nBY ISAAC BICKERSTAFF, ESQ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 50.

I. 85, 86.\r\n\r\n\r\n_White's Chocolate-house, August 2._\r\n\r\n\r\n_The History of Orlando the Fair. Chap. I._\r\n\r\nWhatever malicious men may say of our lucubrations, we have no design\r\nbut to produce unknown merit, or place in a proper light the actions\r\nof our contemporaries who labour to distinguish themselves, whether it\r\nbe by vice or virtue. For we shall never give accounts to the world\r\nof anything, but what the lives and endeavours of the persons (of\r\nwhom we treat) make the basis of their fame and reputation. For this\r\nreason it is to be hoped, that our appearance is reputed a public\r\nbenefit; and though certain persons may turn what we mean for panegyric\r\ninto scandal, let it be answered once for all, that if our praises\r\nare really designed as raillery, such malevolent persons owe their\r\nsafety from it only to their being too inconsiderable for history. It\r\nis not every man who deals in ratsbane, or is unseasonably amorous,\r\nthat can adorn story like Æsculapius;[4] nor every stockjobber of\r\nthe India Company can assume the port, and personate the figure\r\nof Aurengezebe.[5] My noble ancestor, Mr. Shakespeare, who was of\r\nthe race of the Staffs, was not more fond of the memorable Sir\r\nJohn Falstaff, than I am of those worthies; but the Latins have an\r\nadmirable admonition expressed in two words, to wit, _nequid nimis_,\r\nwhich forbids my indulging myself on those delightful subjects, and\r\ncalls me to do justice to others, who make no less figures in our\r\ngeneration: of such, the first and most renowned is, that eminent hero\r\nand lover, Orlando[6] the handsome, whose disappointments in love, in\r\ngallantry, and in war, have banished him from public view, and made\r\nhim voluntarily enter into a confinement, to which the ungrateful age\r\nwould otherwise have forced him. Ten _lustra_ and more are wholly\r\npassed since Orlando first appeared in the metropolis of this island:\r\nhis descent noble, his wit humorous, his person charming. But to none\r\nof these recommendatory advantages was his title so undoubted as that\r\nof his beauty. His complexion was fair, but his countenance manly;\r\nhis stature of the tallest, his shape the most exact; and though in\r\nall his limbs he had a proportion as delicate as we see in the works\r\nof the most skilful statuaries, his body had a strength and firmness\r\nlittle inferior to the marble of which such images are formed. This\r\nmade Orlando the universal flame of all the fair sex: innocent virgins\r\nsighed for him, as Adonis; experienced widows, as Hercules. Thus did\r\nthis figure walk alone the pattern and ornament of our species, but of\r\ncourse the envy of all who had the same passions, without his superior\r\nmerit and pretences to the favour of that enchanting creature, woman.\r\nHowever, the generous Orlando believed himself formed for the world,\r\nand not to be engrossed by any particular affection. He sighed not for\r\nDelia, for Chloris, for Chloe, for Betty, nor my lady, nor for the\r\nready chambermaid, nor distant baroness: woman was his mistress, and\r\nthe whole sex his seraglio. His form was always irresistible: and if we\r\nconsider, that not one of five hundred can bear the least favour from a\r\nlady without being exalted above himself; if also we must allow, that a\r\nsmile from a side-box[7] has made Jack Spruce half mad, we can't think\r\nit wonderful that Orlando's repeated conquests touched his brain: so it\r\ncertainly did, and Orlando became an enthusiast in love; and in all his\r\naddress, contracted something out of the ordinary course of breeding\r\nand civility. However (powerful as he was), he would still add to the\r\nadvantages of his person that of a profession which the ladies favour,\r\nand immediately commenced soldier. Thus equipped for love and honour,\r\nour hero seeks distant climes and adventures, and leaves the despairing\r\nnymphs of Great Britain to the courtship of beau and witlings till\r\nhis return. His exploits in foreign nations and courts have not been\r\nregularly enough communicated unto us, to report them with that\r\nveracity which we profess in our narrations: but after many feats of\r\narms (which those who were witnesses to them have suppressed out of\r\nenvy, but which we have had faithfully related from his own mouth in\r\nour public streets) Orlando, returns home full, but not loaded with\r\nyears. Beau born in his absence made it their business to decry his\r\nfurniture, his dress, his manner; but all such rivalry he suppressed\r\n(as the philosopher did the sceptic, who argued there was no such thing\r\nas motion) by only moving. The beauteous Villaria,[8] who only was\r\nformed for his paramour, became the object of his affection. His first\r\nspeech to her was as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Madam,--It is not only that nature has made us two the most\r\n     accomplished of each sex, and pointed to us to obey her dictates\r\n     in becoming one; but that there is also an ambition in following\r\n     the mighty persons you have favoured. Where kings and heroes, as\r\n     great as Alexander, or such as could personate Alexander,[9] have\r\n     bowed, permit your general to lay his laurels.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Milton:\r\n\r\n    _The fair with conscious majesty approved\r\n    His pleaded reason;_[10]\r\n\r\nand fortune had now supplied Orlando with necessaries for his\r\nhigh taste of gallantry and pleasure: his equipage and economy had\r\nsomething in them more sumptuous and gallant than could be received\r\nin our degenerate age; therefore his figure (though highly graceful)\r\nappeared so exotic, that it assembled all the Britons under the age of\r\nsixteen, who saw his grandeur, to follow his chariot with shouts and\r\nacclamations, which he regarded with the contempt which great minds\r\naffect in the midst of applauses. I remember I had the honour to see\r\nhim one day stop, and call the youths about him, to whom he spake as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"Good bastard,--Go to school, and don't lose your time in following\r\nmy wheels: I am loth to hurt you, because I know not but you are all\r\nmy own offspring: hark'ee, you sirrah with the white hair, I am sure\r\nyou are mine: there is half-a-crown. Tell your mother, this, with the\r\nhalf-crown I gave her when I got you, comes to five shillings. Thou\r\nhast cost me all that, and yet thou art good for nothing. Why, you\r\nyoung dogs, did you never see a man before?\" \"Never such a one as you,\r\nnoble general,\" replied a truant from Westminster. \"Sirrah, I believe\r\nthee: there is a crown for thee. Drive on, coachman.\"\r\n\r\nThis vehicle, though sacred to love, was not adorned with doves: such\r\nan hieroglyphic denoted too languishing a passion. Orlando therefore\r\ngave the eagle,[11] as being of a constitution which inclined him\r\nrather to seize his prey with talons, than pine for it with murmurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, August 2._\r\n\r\nI have received the following letter from Mr. Powell of the Bath,[12]\r\nwho, I think, runs from the point between us, which I leave the whole\r\nworld to judge.\r\n\r\n  _To Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq._\r\n\r\n  \"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"Having a great deal of more advantageous business at present on my\r\nhands, I thought to have deferred answering your _Tatler_ of the\r\n21st instant, till the company was gone, and season over; but having\r\nresolved not to regard any impertinences of your paper, except what\r\nrelate particularly to me, I am the more easily induced to answer you\r\n(as I shall find time to do it): First, partly lest you should think\r\nyourself neglected, which I have reason to believe you would take\r\nheinously ill. Secondly, partly because it will increase my fame, and\r\nconsequently my audience, when all the quality shall see with how much\r\nwit and raillery I show you--I don't care a farthing for you. Thirdly,\r\npartly because, being without books,[13] if I don't show much learning,\r\nit will not be imputed to my having none.\r\n\r\n\"I have travelled Italy, France, and Spain, and fully comprehend what\r\nany German artist in the world can do; yet cannot I imagine, why\r\nyou should endeavour to disturb the repose and plenty which (though\r\nunworthy) I enjoy at this place. It cannot be, that you take offence\r\nat my prologues and epilogues, which you are pleased to miscall foolish\r\nand abusive. No, no, until you give a better,[14] I shall not forbear\r\nthinking, that the true reason of your picking a quarrel with me was,\r\nbecause it is more agreeable to your principles, as well as more to\r\nthe honour of your assured victory, to attack a governor. Mr. Isaac,\r\nMr. Isaac, I can see into a millstone as far as another (as the saying\r\nis). You are for sowing the seeds of sedition and disobedience among\r\nmy puppets, and your zeal for the (good old) cause would make you\r\npersuade Punch to pull the string from his chops, and not move his jaw\r\nwhen I have a mind he should harangue. Now I appeal to all men, if\r\nthis is not contrary to that uncontrollable, unaccountable dominion,\r\nwhich by the laws of nature I exercise over them; for all sorts of wood\r\nand wire were made for the use and benefit of man: I have therefore\r\nan unquestionable right to frame, fashion, and put them together,\r\nas I please; and, having made them what they are, my puppets are my\r\nproperty, and therefore my slaves: nor is there in nature anything\r\nmore just, than the homage which is paid by a less to a more excellent\r\nbeing: so that, by the right therefore of a superior genius, I am their\r\nsupreme moderator, although you would insinuate (agreeably to your\r\nlevelling principles) that I am myself but a great puppet, and can\r\ntherefore have but a co-ordinate jurisdiction with them. I suppose I\r\nhave now sufficiently made it appear, that I have a paternal right[15]\r\nto keep a puppet-show, and this right I will maintain in my prologues\r\non all occasions.\r\n\r\n\"And therefore, if you write a defence of yourself against this my\r\nself-defence, I admonish you to keep within bounds; for every day\r\nwill not be so propitious to you as the 29th of April; and perhaps my\r\nresentment may get the better of my generosity, and I may no longer\r\nscorn to fight one who is not my equal with unequal weapons: there\r\nare such things as _scandalums magnatums_;[16] therefore take heed\r\nhereafter how you write such things as I cannot easily answer, for that\r\nwill put me in a passion.\r\n\r\n\"I order you to handle only these two propositions, to which our\r\ndispute may be reduced: the first, whether I have not an absolute\r\npower, whenever I please, to light a pipe with one of Punch's legs, or\r\nwarm my fingers with his whole carcass? The second, whether the devil\r\nwould not be in Punch, should he by word or deed oppose my sovereign\r\nwill and pleasure? And then, perhaps, I may (if I can find leisure for\r\nit) give you the trouble of a second letter.\r\n\r\n\"But if you intend to tell me of the original of puppet-shows, and\r\nthe several changes, and revolutions that have happened in them,\r\nsince Thespis, and I don't care who, that's _noli me tangere_; I have\r\nsolemnly engaged to say nothing of what I can't approve. Or, if you\r\ntalk of certain contracts with the mayor and burgesses, or fees to the\r\nconstables, for the privilege of acting, I will not write one single\r\nword about any such matters;[17] but shall leave you to be mumbled by\r\nthe learned and very ingenious author of a late book, who knows very\r\nwell what is to be said and done in such cases.[18] He is now shuffling\r\nthe cards, and dealing to Timothy; but if he wins the game, I will send\r\nhim to play at backgammon with you; and then he will satisfy you, that\r\ndeuce-ace makes five.\r\n\r\n\"And so, submitting myself to be tried by my country, and allowing any\r\njury of twelve good men, and true, to be that country; not excepting\r\nany (unless Mr. Isaac Bickerstaff) to be of the panel,[19] for you are\r\nneither good nor true; I bid you heartily farewell; and am,\r\n\r\n  \"Sir,\r\n  Your loving Friend,\r\n  POWELL.[20]\r\n\r\n  \"Bath, _July 28_.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] Nichols suggests that this and the following number were by\r\nAddison, who had sent Steele another packet or two from Ireland since\r\nthe appearance of No. 32. Perhaps Steele made one paper, headed \"The\r\nHistory of Orlando the Fair,\" serve for two numbers (50, 51). The\r\npersonal character of these papers may have caused Steele to omit them\r\nin the list of Addison's papers which he gave to Tickell.

He had married, as the indictment sets forth,\r\non November 25, 1705, Barbara, Duchess of Cleveland, having a former\r\nwife then living. In the course of the evidence at this trial, it\r\nappears, that sixteen days before, viz. November 9, 1705, Mrs. Villars,\r\na very bad woman, had artfully drawn him into a marriage with one Mary\r\nWadsworth, spinster, in the mistaken belief of her being Mrs. Deleau,\r\na widow, with a fortune of £60,000. His marriage with the duchess\r\nwas therefore set aside, and her Grace was allowed the liberty of\r\nmarrying again. He craved the benefit of his clergy, and when sentence\r\nwas given, that he should be burnt in his hand, produced the Queen's\r\nwarrant to suspend execution, and was admitted to bail. In his will,\r\ndated April 9, 1712, and proved on May 12 following, he is styled\r\n\"Robert Feilding, of Feilding Hall, in the county of Warwick, Esq.,\"\r\nand appears to have had some estates at Lutterworth. He is mentioned\r\nby Swift among those who have made \"mean figures\" on some remarkable\r\noccasions. Feilding, having injured his fortune by his gallantry and\r\nextravagance in early life, repaired the breaches he had made in it,\r\nby his first marriage with the Countess of Purbeck, a widow lady of an\r\nancient and noble family in Ireland, who had a large fortune of her\r\nown, to which she had added considerably by a former marriage; she was\r\nthe only daughter and heiress of Barnham Swift, Lord Carlingford, who\r\nwas of the same family with the Dean of St. Patrick's. Feilding is said\r\nto have lived happily for some years with this lady, who was a zealous\r\nRoman Catholic, and could have no great difficulty in inducing a man\r\nwho had no religion to profess himself a proselyte to her religious\r\npersuasion. See No. 51 (Nichols).--On July 29, 1706, Lady Wentworth\r\nwrote to Lord Raby that the Duchess of Cleveland had got Feilding sent\r\nto Newgate \"for threatning to kill her two sons for taking her part,\r\nwhen he beet her and broke open her closet door and took four hundred\r\npd. out.... He beat her sadly and she cried out murder in the street\r\nout of the window, and he shot a blunderbuss at the people\" (\"Wentworth\r\nPapers,\" pp. 58-9). See, too, Luttrell's \"Diary,\" June, July, and\r\nOctober, 1706, _passim_.\r\n\r\n[7] The side-boxes were usually reserved for men, ladies sitting in the\r\nfront boxes, and Pope describes men ogling and bowing from the side\r\nboxes. See, too, the _Spectator_, Nos. 311, 377. But Swift (\"Polite\r\nConversation,\" 1738) writes: \"Pray, Mr. Neverout, what lady was that\r\nyou were talking with in the side box?\" A wench in a side-box was\r\nlooked upon with suspicion. See Nos. 145, 217. In the _Theatre_ (No. 3)\r\nSteele says: \"Three of the fair sex for the front boxes, two gentlemen\r\nof wit and pleasure for the side boxes, and three substantial citizens\r\nfor the pit!\"\r\n\r\n[8] Barbara, daughter and heiress to William Villiers, Viscount\r\nGrandison. She became the mistress of Charles II., who made her\r\nhusband--Roger Palmer--Earl of Castlemain, and afterwards made her\r\nDuchess of Cleveland. On Lord Castlemain's death in 1705 she married\r\nBeau Feilding, from whom she was subsequently divorced. She died of\r\ndropsy on October 9, 1709.\r\n\r\n[9] An allusion to Cardell Goodman, the actor (died 1699), one of the\r\n\"mighty persons\" favoured by the duchess, whose paramour he became.

II._\r\n\r\nFortune being now propitious to the gay Orlando, he dressed, he spoke,\r\nhe moved, as a man might be supposed to do in a nation of pigmies, and\r\nhad an equal value for our approbation or dislike. It is usual for\r\nthose who profess a contempt of the world, to fly from it and live in\r\nobscurity; but Orlando, with a greater magnanimity, contemned it, and\r\nappeared in it to tell them so. If therefore his exalted mien met with\r\nan unwelcome reception, he was sure always to double the cause which\r\ngave the distaste. You see our beauties affect a negligence in the\r\nornament of their hair, and adjusting their head-dresses, as conscious\r\nthat they adorn whatever they wear. Orlando had not only this humour\r\nin common with other beauties, but also had a neglect whether things\r\nbecame him or not, in a world he contemned. For this reason, a noble\r\nparticularity appeared in all his economy, furniture, and equipage.\r\nAnd to convince the present little race, how unequal all their\r\nmeasures were to an antediluvian, as he called himself, in respect of\r\nthe insects which now appear for men, he sometimes rode in an open\r\ntumbril,[22] of less size than ordinary, to show the largeness of his\r\nlimbs, and the grandeur, of his personage, to the greater advantage:\r\nat other seasons, all his appointments had a magnificence, as if it\r\nwere formed by the genius of Trimalchio[23] of old, which showed itself\r\nin doing ordinary things with an air of pomp and grandeur.[24] Orlando\r\ntherefore called for tea by beat of drum; his valet got ready to shave\r\nhim by a trumpet \"To horse\"; and water was brought for his teeth when\r\nthe sound was changed to \"Boots and saddle.\"\r\n\r\nIn all these glorious excesses from the common practice, did the happy\r\nOrlando live and reign in an uninterrupted tranquillity, till an\r\nunlucky accident brought to his remembrance, that one evening he was\r\nmarried before he courted the nuptials of Villaria.[25] Several fatal\r\nmemorandums were produced to revive the memory of this accident, and\r\nthe unhappy lover was for ever banished her presence, to whom he owed\r\nthe support of his just renown and gallantry. But distress does not\r\ndebase noble minds; it only changes the scene, and gives them new glory\r\nby that alteration. Orlando therefore now raves in a garret,[26] and\r\ncalls to his neighbour-skies to pity his dolors, and find redress for\r\nan unhappy lover. All high spirits, in any great agitation of mind,\r\nare inclined to relieve themselves by poetry. The renowned porter of\r\nOliver[27] had not more volumes around his cell in the College of\r\nBedlam, than Orlando in his present apartment. And though inserting\r\npoetry in the midst of prose be thought a licence among correct writers\r\nnot to be indulged, it is hoped, the necessity of doing it to give a\r\njust idea of the hero of whom we treat, will plead for the liberty\r\nwe shall hereafter take, to print Orlando's soliloquies in verse and\r\nprose, after the manner of great wits, and such as those to whom they\r\nare nearly allied.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will's Coffee-house, August 5._\r\n\r\nA great deal of good company of us were this day to see, or rather\r\nto hear, an artful person[28] do several feats of activity with his\r\nthroat and windpipe. The first thing wherewith he presented us, was a\r\nring of bells, which he imitated in a most miraculous manner; after\r\nthat he gave us all the different notes of a pack of hounds, to our\r\ngreat delight and astonishment. The company expressed their applause\r\nwith much noise; and never was heard such an harmony of men and dogs:\r\nbut a certain plump merry fellow, from an angle of the room, fell a\r\ncrowing like a cock so ingeniously, that he won our hearts from the\r\nother operator in an instant. As soon as I saw him, I recollected I\r\nhad seen him on the stage, and immediately knew it to be Tom Mirrour,\r\nthe comical actor.[29] He immediately addressed himself to me, and\r\ntold me, he was surprised to see a _virtuoso_ take satisfaction in\r\nany representations below that of human life; and asked me, whether\r\nI thought this acting bells and dogs was to be considered under the\r\nnotion of wit, humour, or satire? \"Were it not better,\" continued he,\r\n\"to have some particular picture of man laid before your eyes, that\r\nmight incite your laughter?\" He had no sooner spoke the word, but he\r\nimmediately quitted his natural shape, and talked to me in a very\r\ndifferent air and tone from what he had used before; upon which all\r\nthat sat near us laughed; but I saw no distortion in his countenance,\r\nor anything that appeared to me disagreeable. I asked Pacolet, what\r\nmeant that sudden whisper about us? For I could not take the jest. He\r\nanswered: \"The gentleman you were talking to, assumed your air and\r\ncountenance so exactly, that all fell a laughing to see how little you\r\nknew yourself, or how much you were enamoured with your own image. But\r\nthat person,\" continued my monitor, \"if men would make the right use\r\nof him, might be as instrumental to their reforming errors in gesture,\r\nlanguage, and speech, as a dancing-master, linguist, or orator. You see\r\nhe laid yourself before you with so much address, that you saw nothing\r\nparticular in his behaviour: he has so happy a knack of representing\r\nerrors and imperfections, that you can bear your faults in him as well\r\nas in yourself: he is the first mimic that ever gave the beauties, as\r\nwell as the deformities, of the man he acted. What Mr. Dryden said of a\r\nvery great man[30] may be well applied to him:\r\n\r\n                                _He is\r\n    Not one, but all mankind's epitome._\"\r\n\r\nYou are to know, that this pantomime may be said to be a species of\r\nhimself. He has no commerce with the rest of mankind, but as they are\r\nthe objects of imitation; like the Indian fowl, called the mock-bird,\r\nwho has no note of his own, but hits every sound in the wood as soon as\r\nhe hears it; so that Mirrour is at once a copy and an original. Poor\r\nMirrour's fate (as well as talent) is like that of the bird we just now\r\nspoke of. The nightingale, the linnet, the lark, are delighted with his\r\ncompany; but the buzzard, the crow, and the owl, are observed to be\r\nhis mortal enemies. Whenever Sophronius meets Mirrour, he receives him\r\nwith civility and respect, and well knows, a good copy of himself can\r\nbe no injury to him; but Bathillus shuns the street where he expects to\r\nmeet him; for he that knows his every step and look is constrained and\r\naffected, must be afraid to be rivalled in his action, and of having it\r\ndiscovered to be unnatural, by its being practised by another as well\r\nas himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, August 5._\r\n\r\nLetters from Coventry and other places have been sent to me, in answer\r\nto what I have said in relation to my antagonist Mr. Powell,[31] and\r\nadvise me, with warm language, to keep to subjects more proper for me\r\nthan such high points. But the writers of these epistles mistake the\r\nuse and service I propose to the learned world by such observations:\r\nfor you are to understand, that the title of this paper gives me a\r\nright in taking to myself, and inserting in it, all such parts of any\r\nbook or letter which are foreign to the purpose intended, or professed\r\nby the writer: so that suppose two great divines should argue, and\r\ntreat each other with warmth and levity unbecoming their subject or\r\ncharacter, all that they say unfit for that place is very proper to\r\nbe inserted here. Therefore from time to time, in all writings which\r\nshall hereafter be published, you shall have from me extracts of all\r\nthat shall appear not to the purpose; and for the benefit of the gentle\r\nreader, I will show what to turn over unread and what to peruse. For\r\nthis end I have a mathematical sieve preparing, in which I will sift\r\nevery page and paragraph, and all that falls through I shall make bold\r\nwith for my own use. The same thing will be as beneficial in speech;\r\nfor all superfluous expressions in talk fall to me also: as, when a\r\npleader at the Bar designs to be extremely impertinent and troublesome,\r\nand cries, \"Under favour of the Court----With submission, my lord----I\r\nhumbly offer----\" and, \"I think I have well considered this matter;\r\nfor I would be very far from trifling with your lordship's time, or\r\ntrespassing upon your patience----However, thus I will venture to\r\nsay\"--and so forth. Or else, when a sufficiently self-conceited coxcomb\r\nis bringing out something in his own praise, and begins, \"Without\r\nvanity, I must take this upon me to assert.\" There is also a trick\r\nwhich the fair sex have, that will greatly contribute to swell my\r\nvolumes: as, when a woman is going to abuse her best friend, \"Pray,\"\r\nsays she, \"have you heard what I said of Mrs. such a one: I am heartily\r\nsorry to hear anything of that kind, of one I have so great a value\r\nfor; but they make no scruple of telling it; and it was not spoken of\r\nto me as a secret, for now all the town rings of it.\" All such flowers\r\nin rhetoric, and little refuges for malice, are to be noted, and\r\nnaturally belong only to Tatlers. By this method you will immediately\r\nfind volumes contract themselves into octavos, and the labour of a\r\nfortnight got over in half a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. James's Coffee-house, August 5._\r\n\r\nLast night arrived a mail from Lisbon, which gives a very pleasing\r\naccount of the posture of affairs in that part of the world, the enemy\r\nhaving been necessitated wholly to abandon the blockade of Olivenza.\r\nThese advices say that Sir John Jennings[32] was arrived at Lisbon.\r\nWhen that gentleman left Barcelona, his Catholic Majesty was taking all\r\npossible methods for carrying on an offensive war.

Upon her\r\nmaking this public, the expense of sweet powder and jessamine[38] are\r\nconsiderably abated; and the mercers and milliners complain of her\r\nwant of public spirit, in not concealing longer a secret which was so\r\nmuch to the benefit of trade. But so it has happened; and no one was\r\nin confidence with her in carrying on this treaty but the matchless\r\nVirgulta, whose despair of ever entering the matrimonial state, made\r\nher, some nights before Delamira's resolution was made known to the\r\nworld, address herself to her in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\"Delamira, you are now going into that state of life, wherein the use\r\nof your charms is wholly to be applied to the pleasing only one man.\r\nThat swimming air of your body; that jaunty bearing of your head over\r\none shoulder; and that inexpressible beauty in your manner of playing\r\nyour fan, must be lowered into a more confined behaviour, to show that\r\nyou would rather shun than receive addresses in the future. Therefore,\r\ndear Delamira, give me those excellences you leave, and acquaint me\r\nwith your manner of charming. For I take the liberty of our friendship\r\nto say, that when I consider my own stature, motion, complexion, wit\r\nor breeding, I cannot think myself any way your inferior; yet do I go\r\nthrough crowds without wounding a man, and all my acquaintance marry\r\nround me, while I live a virgin unasked, and (I think) unregarded.\"\r\n\r\nDelamira heard her with great attention, and with that dexterity which\r\nis natural to her, told her, that all she had above the rest of her\r\nsex and contemporary beauties was wholly owing to a fan[39] (which\r\nwas left her by her mother, and had been long in the family), which\r\nwhoever had in possession, and used with skill, should command the\r\nhearts of all her beholders: \"And since,\" said she, smiling, \"I have\r\nno more to do with extending my conquests or triumphs, I'll make you\r\na present of this inestimable rarity.\" Virgulta made her expressions\r\nof the highest gratitude for so uncommon a confidence in her, and\r\ndesired she would show her what was peculiar in the management of\r\nthat utensil, which rendered it of such general force while she was\r\nmistress of it. Delamira replied, \"You see, madam, Cupid is the\r\nprincipal figure painted on it; and the skill in playing this fan is,\r\nin several motions of it, to let him appear as little as possible;\r\nfor honourable lovers fly all endeavours to ensnare them; and your\r\nCupid must hide his bow and arrow, or he'll never be sure of his game.\r\nYou may observe,\" continued she, \"that in all public assemblies, the\r\nsexes seem to separate themselves, and draw up to attack each other\r\nwith eyeshot: that is the time when the fan, which is all the armour\r\nof woman, is of most use in our defence; for our minds are construed\r\nby the waving of that little instrument, and our thoughts appear in\r\ncomposure or agitation according to the motion of it. You may observe,\r\nwhen Will Peregrine comes into the side-box,[40] Miss Gatty flutters\r\nher fan[41] as a fly does its wings round a candle; while her elder\r\nsister, who is as much in love with him as she is, is as grave as a\r\nvestal at his entrance, and the consequence is accordingly. He watches\r\nhalf the play for a glance from her sister, while Gatty is overlooked\r\nand neglected. I wish you heartily as much success in the management\r\nof it as I have had: if you think fit to go on where I left off, I\r\nwill give you a short account of the execution I have made with it.\r\nCymon, who is the dullest of mortals, and though a wonderful great\r\nscholar, does not only pause, but seems to take a nap with his eyes\r\nopen between every other sentence in his discourse: him have I made a\r\nleader in assemblies; and one blow on the shoulder as I passed by him,\r\nhas raised him to a downright impertinent in all conversations. The\r\nairy Will Sampler is become as lethargic by this my wand, as Cymon is\r\nsprightly. Take it, good girl, and use it without mercy; for the reign\r\nof beauty never lasted full three years, but it ended in marriage, or\r\ncondemnation to virginity. As you fear therefore the one, and hope for\r\nthe other, I expect an hourly journal of your triumphs; for I have it\r\nby certain tradition, that it was given to the first who wore it by\r\nan enchantress, with this remarkable power, that it bestows a husband\r\nin half a year to her who does not overlook her proper minute; but\r\nassigns to a long despair the woman who is well offered, and neglects\r\nthat proposal. May occasion attend your charms, and your charms slip no\r\noccasion. Give me, I say, an account of the progress of your forces at\r\nour next meeting; and you shall hear what I think of my new condition.\r\nI should meet my future spouse this moment. Farewell. Live in just\r\nterror of the dreadful words, SHE WAS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, August 8._\r\n\r\nI had the honour this evening to visit some ladies, where the subject\r\nof the conversation was Modesty, which they commended as a quality\r\nquite as becoming in men as in women. I took the liberty to say, it\r\nmight be as beautiful in our behaviour as in theirs; yet it could\r\nnot be said, it was as successful in life; for as it was the only\r\nrecommendation in them, so it was the greatest obstacle to us both\r\nin love and business. A gentleman present was of my mind, and said,\r\nthat we must describe the difference between the modesty of women and\r\nthat of men, or we should be confounded in our reasonings upon it;\r\nfor this virtue is to be regarded with respect to our different ways\r\nof life. The woman's province is to be careful in her economy, and\r\nchaste in her affection: the man's to be active in the improvement of\r\nhis fortune, and ready to undertake whatever is consistent with his\r\nreputation for that end. Modesty therefore in a woman has a certain\r\nagreeable fear in all she enters upon; and in men it is composed of a\r\nright judgment of what is proper for them to attempt. From hence it\r\nis, that a discreet man is always a modest one. It is to be noted\r\nthat modesty in a man is never to be allowed as a good quality, but a\r\nweakness, if it suppresses his virtue, and hides it from the world,\r\nwhen he has at the same time a mind to exert himself. A French author\r\nsays very justly, that modesty is to the other virtues in a man, what\r\nshade in a picture is to the parts of the thing represented: it makes\r\nall the beauties conspicuous which would otherwise be but a wild heap\r\nof colours. This shade on our actions must therefore be very justly\r\napplied; for if there be too much, it hides our good qualities, instead\r\nof showing them to advantage. Nestor[42] in Athens was an unhappy\r\ninstance of this truth; for he was not only in his profession the\r\ngreatest man of that age, but had given more proofs of it than any\r\nother man ever did; yet for want of that natural freedom and audacity\r\nwhich is necessary in commerce with men, his personal modesty overthrew\r\nall his public actions. Nestor was in those days a skilful architect,\r\nand in a manner the inventor of the use of mechanic powers, which he\r\nbrought to so great perfection that he knew to an atom what foundation\r\nwould bear such a superstructure: and they record of him that he was so\r\nprodigiously exact that for the experiment-sake he built an edifice of\r\ngreat beauty, and seeming strength; but contrived so as to bear only\r\nits own parts, and not to admit the addition of the least particle.\r\nThis building was beheld with much admiration by all the _virtuosi_\r\nof that time; but fell down with no other pressure but the settling\r\nof a wren upon the top of it.[43] But Nestor's modesty was such that\r\nhis art and skill were soon disregarded for want of that manner with\r\nwhich men of the world support and assert the merit of their own\r\nperformances. Soon after this example of his art Athens was, by the\r\ntreachery of its enemies, burnt to the ground. This gave Nestor the\r\ngreatest occasion that ever builder had to render his name immortal,\r\nand his person venerable: for all the new city rose according to his\r\ndisposition, and all the monuments of the glories and distresses of\r\nthat people were erected by that sole artist. Nay, all their temples,\r\nas well as houses, were the effects of his study and labour; insomuch,\r\nthat it was said by an old sage, \"Sure, Nestor will now be famous; for\r\nthe habitations of gods, as well as men, are built by his contrivance.\"\r\nBut this bashful quality still put a damp upon his great knowledge,\r\nwhich has as fatal an effect upon men's reputation as poverty; for as\r\nit was said, the poor man saved the city, and the poor man's labour\r\nwas forgot; so here we see, the modest man built the city, and the\r\nmodest man's skill was unknown.[44] Thus we see every man is the maker\r\nof his own fortune; and what is very odd to consider, he must in some\r\nmeasure be the trumpet of his fame: not that men are to be tolerated\r\nwho directly praise themselves, but they are to be endued with a\r\nsort of defensive eloquence, by which they shall be always capable of\r\nexpressing the rules and arts by which they govern themselves. Varillus\r\nwas the man of all I have read of the happiest in the true possession\r\nof this quality of modesty. My author says of him, Modesty in Varillus\r\nis really a virtue; for it is a voluntary quality, and the effect\r\nof good sense. He is naturally bold and enterprising; but so justly\r\ndiscreet, that he never acts or speaks anything, but those who behold\r\nhim know he has forborne much more than he has performed or uttered,\r\nout of deference to the persons before whom he is. This makes Varillus\r\ntruly amiable, and all his attempts successful; for as bad as the world\r\nis thought to be by those who are perhaps unskilled in it, want of\r\nsuccess in our actions is generally owing to want of judgment in what\r\nwe ought to attempt, or a rustic modesty which will not give us leave\r\nto undertake what we ought. But how unfortunate this diffident temper\r\nis to those who are possessed with it may be best seen in the success\r\nof such as are wholly unacquainted with it. We have one peculiar\r\nelegance in our language above all others, which is conspicuous in\r\nthe term \"fellow.\" This word added to any of our adjectives extremely\r\nvaries, or quite alters the sense of that with which it is joined.\r\nThus, though a modest man is the most unfortunate of all men, yet a\r\nmodest fellow is as superlatively happy. A modest fellow is a ready\r\ncreature, who with great humility, and as great forwardness, visits his\r\npatrons at all hours, and meets them in all places, and has so moderate\r\nan opinion of himself, that he makes his court at large. If you won't\r\ngive him a great employment, he will be glad of a little one. He has\r\nso great a deference for his benefactor's judgment, that as he thinks\r\nhimself fit for anything he can get, so he is above nothing which is\r\noffered; like the young bachelor of arts, who came to town recommended\r\nto a chaplain's place; but none being vacant, modestly accepted of\r\nthat of a postillion. We have very many conspicuous persons of this\r\nundertaking yet modest turn; I have a grandson who is very happy in\r\nthis quality: I sent him at the time of the last peace into France. As\r\nsoon as he landed at Calais, he sent me an exact account of the nature\r\nof the people, and the policies of the King of France. I got him since\r\nchosen a member of a corporation: the modest creature, as soon as he\r\ncame into the Common Council, told a senior burgess, he was perfectly\r\nout in the orders of their house. In other circumstances, he is so\r\nthoroughly modest a fellow, that he seems to pretend only to things he\r\nunderstands. He is a citizen only at Court, and in the city a courtier.\r\nIn a word, to speak the characteristical difference between a modest\r\nman and a modest fellow; the modest man is in doubt in all his actions;\r\na modest fellow never has a doubt from his cradle to his grave.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[36] This article may be by Addison; see note to No. 50.\r\n\r\n[37] Probably Lord Archibald Hamilton, son to William, third Duke of\r\nHamilton.

He lived, according to the inscription by his son in\r\nSt. Paul's Cathedral, _non sibi, sed bono publico_.\r\n\r\n[43] This passage alludes to an opposition which was made to a digest\r\nof designs for the reparation of St. Paul's, laid before the King\r\nand the commissioners in the beginning of 1666, which, the author\r\ninsinuates, was rather an opposition to Sir C. Wren, than to his plan;\r\nit continued, however, till within a few days of the fire on September\r\n2 in that year, which put the reparation of the cathedral out of the\r\nquestion. There was likewise another model of St. Paul's, to which Sir\r\nChristopher (certainly the best judge, and far from being mercenary)\r\ngave the preference, and which he would have executed with more\r\ncheerfulness and satisfaction, had he not been overruled by those whom\r\nit was his duty to obey. (Nichols.)\r\n\r\n[44] Wren was not able to carry out the scheme for rebuilding the City\r\nin the way he had hoped. It appears that he received only about £200 a\r\nyear for building St. Paul's, and £100 a year for rebuilding the other\r\nCity churches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 53.

Elmira is the daughter\r\nof a rich and worthy citizen, who gave her to Osmyn with a portion\r\nwhich might have obtained her an alliance with our noblest houses,\r\nand fixed her in the eye of the world, where her story had not been\r\nnow to be related: for her good qualities had made her the object of\r\nuniversal esteem among the polite part of mankind, from whom she has\r\nbeen banished and immured till the death of her gaoler.

She was not\r\nbeholden to the charms of her sex, that her company was preferable to\r\nany Osmyn could meet with abroad; for were all she said considered,\r\nwithout regard to her being a woman, it might stand the examination of\r\nthe severest judges: for she had all the beauty of her own sex, with\r\nall the conversation-accomplishments of ours. But Osmyn very soon grew\r\nsurfeited with the charms of her person by possession, and of her mind\r\nby want of taste; for he was one of that loose sort of men, who have\r\nbut one reason for setting any value on the fair sex, who consider even\r\nbrides but as new women, and consequently neglect them when they cease\r\nto be such. All the merit of Elmira could not prevent her becoming a\r\nmere wife within few months after her nuptials; and Osmyn had so little\r\nrelish for her conversation, that he complained of the advantages\r\nof it. \"My spouse,\" said he to one of his companions, \"is so very\r\ndiscreet, so good, so virtuous, and I know not what, that I think her\r\nperson is rather the object of esteem than of love; and there is such a\r\nthing as a merit, which causes rather distance than passion.\" But there\r\nbeing no medium in the state of matrimony, their life began to take\r\nthe usual gradations to become the most irksome of all beings. They\r\ngrew in the first place very complaisant; and having at heart a certain\r\nknowledge that they were indifferent to each other, apologies were made\r\nfor every little circumstance which they thought betrayed their mutual\r\ncoldness. This lasted but few months, when they showed a difference of\r\nopinion in every trifle; and as a sign of certain decay of affection,\r\nthe word \"perhaps\" was introduced in all their discourse. \"I have a\r\nmind to go to the Park,\" says she; \"but perhaps, my dear, you will want\r\nthe coach on some other occasion.\" He would very willingly carry her to\r\nthe play; but perhaps, she had rather go to Lady Centaur's[46] and play\r\nat ombre.[47] They were both persons of good discerning, and soon found\r\nthat they mortally hated each other, by their manner of hiding it.\r\nCertain it is, that there are some genios which are not capable of pure\r\naffection, and a man is born with talents for it as much as for poetry\r\nor any other science. Osmyn began too late to find the imperfection of\r\nhis own heart, and used all the methods in the world to correct it,\r\nand argue himself into return of desire and passion for his wife, by\r\nthe contemplation of her excellent qualities, his great obligations to\r\nher, and the high value he saw all the world except himself did put\r\nupon her. But such is man's unhappy condition, that though the weakness\r\nof the heart has a prevailing power over the strength of the head,\r\nyet the strength of the head has but small force against the weakness\r\nof the heart. Osmyn therefore struggled in vain to revive departed\r\ndesire; and therefore resolved to retire to one of his estates in the\r\ncountry, and pass away his hours of wedlock by the noble diversions of\r\nthe field; and in the fury of a disappointed lover, made an oath, to\r\nleave neither stag, fox, nor hare living, during the days of his wife.\r\nBesides that country sports would be an amusement, he hoped also, that\r\nhis spouse would be half killed by the very sense of seeing this town\r\nno more, and would think her life ended as soon as she left it. He\r\ncommunicated his design to Elmira, who received it (as now she did all\r\nthings) like a person too unhappy to be relieved or afflicted by the\r\ncircumstance of place. This unexpected resignation made Osmyn resolve\r\nto be as obliging to her as possible; and if he could not prevail upon\r\nhimself to be kind, he took a resolution at least to act sincerely, and\r\nto communicate frankly to her the weakness of his temper, to excuse the\r\nindifference of his behaviour. He disposed his household in the way\r\nto Rutland, so as he and his lady travelled only in the coach for the\r\nconvenience of discourse. They had not gone many miles out of town,\r\nwhen Osmyn spoke to this purpose:\r\n\r\n     \"My dear, I believe I look quite as silly, now I am going to\r\n     tell you I do not love you, as when I first told you I did. We\r\n     are now going into the country together, with only one hope for\r\n     making this life agreeable, survivorship: desire is not in our\r\n     power; mine is all gone for you. What shall we do to carry it with\r\n     decency to the world, and hate one another with discretion?\"\r\n\r\nThe lady answered without the least observation on the extravagance of\r\nhis speech:\r\n\r\n\"My dear, you have lived most of your days in a Court, and I have not\r\nbeen wholly unacquainted with that sort of life. In Courts, you see\r\ngood-will is spoken with great warmth, ill will covered with great\r\ncivility. Men are long in civilities to those they hate, and short in\r\nexpressions of kindness to those they love. Therefore, my dear, let us\r\nbe well-bred still, and it is no matter, as to all who see us, whether\r\nwe love or hate: and to let you see how much you are beholden to me\r\nfor my conduct, I have both hated and despised you, my dear, this half\r\nyear; and yet neither in language nor behaviour has it been visible\r\nbut that I loved you tenderly. Therefore, as I know you go out of town\r\nto divert life in pursuit of beasts, and conversation with men just\r\nabove them; so, my life, from this moment, I shall read all the learned\r\ncooks who have ever writ, study broths, plaisters, and conserves, till\r\nfrom a fine lady I become a notable woman. We must take our minds a\r\nnote or two lower, or we shall be tortured by jealousy or anger. Thus\r\nI am resolved to kill all keen passions by employing my mind on little\r\nsubjects, and lessening the easiness of my spirit; while you, my dear,\r\nwith much ale, exercise, and ill company, are so good as to endeavour\r\nto be as contemptible as it is necessary for my quiet I should think\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nTo Rutland they arrived, and lived with great, but secret impatience\r\nfor many successive years, till Osmyn thought of a happy expedient to\r\ngive their affairs a new turn. One day he took Elmira aside, and spoke\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"My dear, you see here the air is so temperate and serene, the\r\nrivulets, the groves, and soil, so extremely kind to nature, that we\r\nare stronger and firmer in our health since we left the town; so that\r\nthere is no hope of a release in this place: but if you will be so\r\nkind as to go with me to my estate in the Hundreds of Essex, it is\r\npossible some kind damp may one day or other relieve us. If you will\r\ncondescend to accept of this offer, I will add that whole estate to\r\nyour jointure in this county.\"\r\n\r\nElmira, who was all goodness, accepted the offer, removed accordingly,\r\nand has left her spouse in that place to rest with his fathers.\r\n\r\nThis is the real figure in which Elmira ought to be beheld in this\r\ntown, and not thought guilty of an indecorum, in not professing the\r\nsense, or bearing the habit of sorrow, for one who robbed her of all\r\nthe endearments of life, and gave her only common civility, instead\r\nof complacency of manners, dignity of passion, and that constant\r\nassemblage of soft desires and affections which all feel who love, but\r\nnone can express.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will's Coffee-house, August 10._\r\n\r\nMr. Truman, who is a mighty admirer of dramatic poetry, and knows I am\r\nabout a tragedy, never meets me, but he is giving admonitions and hints\r\nfor my conduct. \"Mr. Bickerstaff,\" said he, \"I was reading last night\r\nyour second act you were so kind to lend me; but I find you depend\r\nmightily upon the retinue of your hero to make him magnificent. You\r\nmake guards, and ushers, and courtiers, and commons, and nobles, march\r\nbefore, and then enters your prince, and says they can't defend him\r\nfrom his love. Why, prithee Isaac, who ever thought they could? Place\r\nme your loving monarch in a solitude; let him have no sense at all of\r\nhis grandeur, but let it be eaten up with his passion. He must value\r\nhimself as the greatest of lovers, not as the first of princes: and\r\nthen let him say a more tender thing than ever man said before--for\r\nhis feather and eagle's beak is nothing at all. The man is to be\r\nexpressed by his sentiments and affections, and not by his fortune or\r\nequipage. You are also to take care, that at his first entrance he\r\nsays something which may give us an idea of what we are to expect in\r\na person of his way of thinking. Shakespeare is your pattern.\"[48] In\r\nthe tragedy of \"Cæsar,\" he introduces his hero in his nightgown. He\r\nhad at that time all the power of Rome: deposed consuls, subordinate\r\ngenerals, and captive princes, might have preceded him; but his genius\r\nwas above such mechanic methods of showing greatness. Therefore he\r\nrather presents that great soul debating upon the subject of life and\r\ndeath with his intimate friends, without endeavouring to prepossess his\r\naudience with empty show and pomp. When those who attend him talk of\r\nthe many omens which had appeared that day, he answers:\r\n\r\n    _Cowards die many times before their deaths;\r\n    The valiant never taste of death but once.\r\n    Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,\r\n    It seems to me most strange that men should fear;\r\n    Seeing that death, a necessary end,\r\n    Will come, when it will come.[49]_\r\n\r\nWhen the hero has spoken this sentiment, there is nothing that is great\r\nwhich cannot be expected, from one whose first position is the contempt\r\nof death to so high a degree, as making his exit a thing wholly\r\nindifferent, and not a part of his care, but that of heaven and fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. James's Coffee-house, August 10._\r\n\r\nLetters from Brussels of the 15th instant, N.S., say, that\r\nMajor-General Ravignan returned on the 8th with the French king's\r\nanswer to the intended capitulation for the citadel of Tournay; which\r\nis, that he does not think fit to sign that capitulation, except the\r\nAllies will grant a cessation of arms in general, during the time in\r\nwhich all acts of hostility were to have ceased between the citadel\r\nand the besiegers. Soon after the receipt of this news, the cannon on\r\neach side began to play. There are two attacks against the citadel,\r\ncommanded by General Lottum and General Schuylemberg, which are both\r\ncarried on with great success; and it is not doubted but the citadel\r\nwill be in the hands of the Allies before the last day of this month.\r\nLetters from Ipres say, that on the 9th instant, part of the garrison\r\nof that place had mutinied in two bodies, each consisting of two\r\nhundred; who being dispersed the same day, a body of eight hundred\r\nappeared in the market-place at nine the night following, and seized\r\nall manner of provisions; but were with much difficulty quieted. The\r\ngovernor has not punished any of the offenders, the dissatisfaction\r\nbeing universal in that place; and it is thought, the officers foment\r\nthose disorders; that the Ministry may be convinced of the necessity\r\nof paying those troops, and supplying them with provisions. These\r\nadvices add, that on the 14th the Marquis d'Este passed express through\r\nBrussels from the Duke of Savoy, with advice, that the army of his\r\nroyal highness had forced the retrenchments of the enemy in Savoy, and\r\ndefeated that body of men which guarded those passes under the command\r\nof the Marquis de Thouy.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[45] Perhaps this article is by Addison; see note to No. 50.\r\n\r\n[46] The name of a character in Jonson's \"Silent Woman.\"\r\n\r\n[47] A game of cards played by three persons, of which particulars will\r\nbe found in Pope's \"Rape of the Lock.\"\r\n\r\n[48] In the _Spectator_, No. 42, Addison ridiculed the way in which\r\ndignity was sought for the hero on the stage by means of grand dresses\r\nand guards with halberts and battleaxes. \"Can all the trappings or\r\nequipage of a king or hero give Brutus half that pomp and majesty which\r\nhe receives from a few lines in Shakespeare?\"\r\n\r\n[49] \"Julius Cæsar,\" act ii. sc. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 54. [STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, August 11_, to _Saturday, August 13, 1709_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_White's Chocolate-house, August 12._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Government of Affection._[50]\r\n\r\nWhen labour was pronounced to be the portion of man, that doom reached\r\nthe affections of his mind, as well as his person, the matter on which\r\nhe was to feed, and all the animal and vegetable world about him. There\r\nis therefore an assiduous care and cultivation to be bestowed upon our\r\npassions and affections; for they, as they are the excrescences of our\r\nsouls, like our hair and beards, look horrid or becoming, as we cut\r\nor let them grow. All this grave preface is meant to assign a reason\r\nin nature for the unaccountable behaviour of Duumvir,[51] the husband\r\nand keeper. Ten thousand follies had this unhappy man escaped, had he\r\nmade a compact with himself to be upon his guard, and not permitted\r\nhis vagrant eye to let in so many different inclinations upon him, as\r\nall his days he has been perplexed with. But indeed at present he has\r\nbrought himself to be confined only to one prevailing mistress; between\r\nwhom and his wife, Duumvir passes his hours in all the vicissitudes\r\nwhich attend passion and affection, without the intervention of reason.\r\nLaura his wife, and Phyllis his mistress, are all with whom he has had,\r\nfor some months, the least amorous commerce. Duumvir has passed the\r\nnoon of life; but cannot withdraw from those entertainments which are\r\npardonable only before that stage of our being, and which after that\r\nseason are rather punishments than satisfaction: for palled appetite\r\nis humorous, and must be gratified with sauces rather than food. For\r\nwhich end Duumvir is provided with an haughty, imperious, expensive,\r\nand fantastic mistress, to whom he retires from the conversation of\r\nan affable, humble, discreet, and affectionate wife. Laura receives\r\nhim after absence with an easy and unaffected complacency; but that\r\nhe calls insipid: Phyllis rates him for his absence, and bids him\r\nreturn from whence he came: this he calls spirit and fire. Laura's\r\ngentleness is thought mean; Phyllis' insolence, sprightly. Were you\r\nto see him at his own home, and his mistress's lodgings, to Phyllis\r\nhe appears an obsequious lover, to Laura an imperious master. Nay, so\r\nunjust is the taste of Duumvir, that he owns Laura has no ill quality,\r\nbut that she is his wife; Phyllis no good one, but that she is his\r\nmistress. And he has himself often said, were he married to any one\r\nelse, he would rather keep Laura than any woman living; yet allows at\r\nthe same time, that Phyllis, were she a woman of honour, would have\r\nbeen the most insipid animal breathing. The other day Laura, who has\r\na voice like an angel, began to sing to him: \"Fie, madam,\" he cried,\r\n\"we must be past all these gaieties.\" Phyllis has a note as rude and\r\nas loud as that of a milkmaid: when she begins to warble, \"Well,\" says\r\nhe, \"there is such a pleasing simplicity in all that wench does.\" In\r\na word, the affectionate part of his heart being corrupted, and his\r\ntrue taste that way wholly lost, he has contracted a prejudice to all\r\nthe behaviour of Laura, and a general partiality in favour of Phyllis.\r\nIt is not in the power of the wife to do a pleasing thing, nor in the\r\nmistress to commit one that is disagreeable. There is something too\r\nmelancholy in the reflection on this circumstance to be the subject of\r\nraillery. He said a sour thing to Laura at dinner the other day; upon\r\nwhich she burst into tears. \"What the devil, madam,\" says he, \"can't I\r\nspeak in my own house?\" He answered Phyllis a little abruptly at supper\r\nthe same evening; upon which she threw his periwig into the fire.\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"thou art a brave termagant jade; do you know, hussy,\r\nthat fair wig cost forty guineas?\" O Laura! is it for this that the\r\nfaithful Chromius sighed for you in vain? How is thy condition altered,\r\nsince crowds of youth hung on thy eye, and watched its glances? It is\r\nnot many months since Laura was the wonder and pride of her own sex, as\r\nwell as the desire and passion of ours. At plays and at balls, the just\r\nturn of her behaviour, the decency of her virgin charms, chastised,\r\nyet added to diversions. At public devotions, her winning modesty, her\r\nresigned carriage, made virtue and religion appear with new ornaments,\r\nand in the natural apparel of simplicity and beauty. In ordinary\r\nconversations, a sweet conformity of manners, and a humility which\r\nheightened all the complacencies of good breeding and education, gave\r\nher more slaves than all the pride of her sex ever made woman wish for.\r\nLaura's hours are now spent in the sad reflections on her choice, and\r\nthat deceitful vanity (almost inseparable from the sex) of believing,\r\nshe could reclaim one that had so often ensnared others; as it now is,\r\nit is not even in the power of Duumvir himself to do her justice: for\r\nthough beauty and merit are things real, and independent on taste and\r\nopinion, yet agreeableness is arbitrary, and the mistress has much\r\nthe advantage of the wife. But whenever fate is so kind to her and\r\nher spouse as to end her days, with all this passion for Phyllis, and\r\nindifference for Laura, he has a second wife in view, who may avenge\r\nthe injuries done to her predecessor. Aglaura is the destined lady, who\r\nhas lived in assemblies, has ambition and play for her entertainment,\r\nand thinks of a man, not as the object of love, but the tool of\r\nher interest or pride. If ever Aglaura comes to the empire of this\r\ninconstant, she will endear the memory of her predecessor. But in the\r\nmeantime, it is melancholy to consider, that the virtue of a wife is\r\nlike the merit of a poet, never justly valued till after death.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, August 11._\r\n\r\nAs we have professed, that all the actions of men are our subject, the\r\nmost solemn are not to be omitted, if there happen to creep into their\r\nbehaviour anything improper for such occasions. Therefore the offence\r\nmentioned in the following epistles (though it may seem to be committed\r\nin a place sacred from observation) is such, that it is our duty to\r\nremark upon it; for though he who does it is himself only guilty of an\r\nindecorum, he occasions a criminal levity in all others who are present\r\nat it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"MR. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n\"It being mine, as well as the opinion of many others, that your papers\r\nare extremely well fitted to reform any irregular or indecent practice,\r\nI present the following as one which requires your correction. Myself,\r\nand a great many good people who frequent the divine service at St.\r\nPaul's, have been a long time scandalised by the imprudent conduct\r\nof Stentor[52] in that cathedral. This gentleman, you must know, is\r\nalways very exact and zealous in his devotion, which, I believe, nobody\r\nblames; but then he is accustomed to roar and bellow so terribly loud\r\nin the responses, that he frightens even us of the congregation, who\r\nare daily used to him; and one of our petty canons, a punning Cambridge\r\nscholar,[53] calls his way of worship, a bull offering. His harsh\r\nuntunable pipe is no more fit than a raven's to join with the music of\r\na choir; yet nobody having been enough his friend, I suppose, to inform\r\nhim of it, he never fails, when present, to drown the harmony of every\r\nhymn and anthem, by an inundation of sound beyond that of the bridge at\r\nthe ebb of the tide, or the neighbouring lions in the anguish of their\r\nhunger. This is a grievance which, to my certain knowledge, several\r\nworthy people desire to see redressed; and if by inserting this epistle\r\nin your paper, or by representing the matter your own way, you can\r\nconvince Stentor, that discord in a choir is the same sin that schism\r\nis in the Church in general, you would lay a great obligation upon us,\r\nand make some atonement for certain of your paragraphs which have not\r\nbeen highly approved by us. I am,\r\n\r\n  \"Sir,\r\n  Your most humble Servant,\r\n  JEOFFRY CHANTICLEER.\r\n\r\n  \"St. Paul's Churchyard, _August 11_.\"\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful there should be such a general lamentation, and the\r\ngrievance so frequent, and yet the offender never know anything of it.\r\nI have received the following letter from my kinsman at the Heralds'\r\nOffice, near the same place:\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR COUSIN,\r\n\r\n     \"This office, which has had its share in the impartial justice of\r\n     your censures, demands at present your vindication of their rights\r\n     and privileges. There are certain hours when our young heralds\r\n     are exercised in the faculties of making proclamation, and other\r\n     vociferations, which of right belong to us only to utter: but at\r\n     the same hours, Stentor in St. Paul's Church, in spite of the\r\n     coaches, carts, London cries, and all other sounds between us,\r\n     exalts his throat to so high a key, that the most noisy of our\r\n     order is utterly unheard. If you please to observe upon this, you\r\n     will ever oblige, &c.\"\r\n\r\nThere have been communicated to me some other ill consequences from\r\nthe same cause; as, the overturning of coaches by sudden starts of the\r\nhorses as they passed that way, women pregnant frightened, and heirs to\r\nfamilies lost; which are public disasters, though arising from a good\r\nintention: but it is hoped, after this admonition, that Stentor will\r\navoid an act of so great supererogation, as singing without a voice.\r\n\r\nBut I am diverted from prosecuting Stentor's reformation, by an\r\naccount, that the two faithful lovers, Lysander and Coriana, are dead;\r\nfor no longer ago than the 1st of the last month they swore eternal\r\nfidelity to each other, and to love till death. Ever since that time,\r\nLysander has been twice a day at the chocolate-house, visits in every\r\ncircle, is missing four hours in four and twenty, and will give no\r\naccount of himself. These are undoubted proofs of the departure of\r\na lover; and consequently Coriana is also dead as a mistress. I have\r\nwritten to Stentor to give this couple three calls at the church door,\r\nwhich they must hear if they are living within the bills of mortality;\r\nand if they do not answer at that time, they are from that moment added\r\nto the number of my defunct.[54]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[50] This article may be by Addison; see note to No. 50.\r\n\r\n[51] It has been suggested that Duumvir is meant for the Duke of\r\nOrmond, and this view is supported by the MS. annotator mentioned in a\r\nnote to No. 4.

The\r\nslow steps of Providence and Nature, and strange events which are\r\nbrought about in an instant, are what, as they come within our view\r\nand observation, shall be given to the public. Such things are not\r\naccompanied with show and noise, and therefore seldom draw the eyes\r\nof the unattentive part of mankind; but are very proper at once\r\nto exercise our humanity, please our imaginations, and improve\r\nour judgments. It may not therefore be unuseful to relate many\r\ncircumstances, which were observable upon a late cure done upon a young\r\ngentleman who was born blind, and on the 29th of June last received his\r\nsight at the age of twenty years, by the operation of an oculist. This\r\nhappened no farther off than Newington, and the work was prepared for\r\nin the following manner: The operator, Mr. Grant,[55] having observed\r\nthe eyes of his patient, and convinced his friends and relations, among\r\nothers the Rev. Mr. Caswell, minister of the place, that it was highly\r\nprobable he should remove the obstacle which prevented the use of his\r\nsight; all his acquaintance, who had any regard for the young man, or\r\ncuriosity to be present when one of full age and understanding received\r\na new sense, assembled themselves on this occasion. Mr. Caswell[56]\r\nbeing a gentleman particularly curious, desired the whole company,\r\nin case the blindness should be cured, to keep silence, and let the\r\npatient make his own observations, without the direction of anything he\r\nhad received by his other senses, or the advantage of discovering his\r\nfriends by their voices. Among several others, the mother, brethren,\r\nsisters, and a young gentlewoman for whom he had a passion, were\r\npresent. The work was performed with great skill and dexterity. When\r\nthe patient first received the dawn of light, there appeared such\r\nan ecstasy in his action, that he seemed ready to swoon away in the\r\nsurprise of joy and wonder. The surgeon stood before him with his\r\ninstruments in his hand. The young man observed him from head to foot;\r\nafter which he surveyed himself as carefully, and seemed to compare him\r\nto himself; and observing both their hands, seemed to think they were\r\nexactly alike, except the instruments, which he took for parts of his\r\nhands. When he had continued in this amazement some time, his mother\r\ncould not longer bear the agitations of so many passions as thronged\r\nupon her, but fell upon his neck, crying out, \"My son! my son!\" The\r\nyouth knew her voice, and could speak no more than, \"Oh me! are you\r\nmy mother?\" and fainted. The whole room, you will easily conceive,\r\nwere very affectionately employed in recovering him; but above all,\r\nthe young gentlewoman who loved him, and whom he loved, shrieked in\r\nthe loudest manner. That voice seemed to have a sudden effect upon\r\nhim as he recovered, and he showed a double curiosity in observing\r\nher as she spoke and called to him; till at last he broke out, \"What\r\nhas been done to me? Whither am I carried? Is all this about me, the\r\nthing I have heard so often of? Is this the light? Is this seeing?\r\nWere you always thus happy, when you said you were glad to see each\r\nother? Where is Tom, who used to lead me? But I could now, methinks,\r\ngo anywhere without him.\" He offered to move, but seemed afraid of\r\neverything around him. When they saw his difficulty, they told him,\r\ntill he became better acquainted with his new being, he must let the\r\nservant still lead him. The boy was called for, and presented to him.\r\nMr. Caswell asked him, what sort of thing he took Tom to be before he\r\nhad seen him. He answered, he believed there was not so much of him as\r\nof himself; but he fancied him the same sort of creature. The noise\r\nof this sudden change made all the neighbourhood throng to the place\r\nwhere he was. As he saw the crowd thickening, he desired Mr. Caswell\r\nto tell him how many there were in all to be seen. The gentleman,\r\nsmiling, answered him, that it would be very proper for him to return\r\nto his late condition, and suffer his eyes to be covered, till they had\r\nreceived strength; for he might remember well enough, that by degrees\r\nhe had from little and little come to the strength he had at present in\r\nhis ability of walking and moving; and that it was the same thing with\r\nhis eyes, which, he said, would lose the power of continuing to him\r\nthat wonderful transport he was now in, except he would be contented\r\nto lay aside the use of them, till they were strong enough to bear the\r\nlight without so much feeling, as he knew he underwent at present. With\r\nmuch reluctance he was prevailed upon to have his eyes bound, in which\r\ncondition they kept him in a dark room, till it was proper to let the\r\norgan receive its objects without further precaution. During the time\r\nof this darkness, he bewailed himself in the most distressed manner,\r\nand accused all his friends, complaining, that some incantation had\r\nbeen wrought upon him, and some strange magic used to deceive him into\r\nan opinion, that he had enjoyed what they called sight. He added, that\r\nthe impressions then let in upon his soul would certainly distract him,\r\nif he were not so at that present. At another time he would strive to\r\nname the persons he had seen among the crowd after he was couched,\r\nand would pretend to speak (in perplexed terms of his own making) of\r\nwhat he in that short time observed, But on the 6th instant it was\r\nthought fit to unbind his head, and the young woman whom he loved was\r\ninstructed to open his eyes accordingly, as well to endear herself\r\nto him by such a circumstance, as to moderate his ecstasies by the\r\npersuasion of a voice, which had so much power over him as hers ever\r\nhad. When this beloved young woman began to restore him, she talked to\r\nhim as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. William, I am now taking the binding off, though when I consider\r\nwhat I am doing, I tremble with the apprehension, that (though I have\r\nfrom my very childhood loved you, dark as you were, and though you had\r\nconceived so strong a love for me) yet you will find there is such a\r\nthing as beauty, which may ensnare you into a thousand passions of\r\nwhich you now are innocent, and take you from me for ever. But before I\r\nput myself to that hazard, tell me in what manner that love you always\r\nprofessed to me entered into your heart; for its usual admission is at\r\nthe eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man answered, \"Dear Lydia, if I am to lose by sight the soft\r\npantings which I have always felt when I heard your voice; if I am no\r\nmore to distinguish the step of her I love when she approaches me, but\r\nto change that sweet and frequent pleasure for such an amazement as I\r\nknew the little time I lately saw: or if I am to have anything besides,\r\nwhich may take from me the sense I have of what appeared most pleasing\r\nto me at that time (which apparition it seems was you): pull out these\r\neyes, before they lead me to be ungrateful to you, or undo myself. I\r\nwished for them but to see you; pull them out, if they are to make me\r\nforget you.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLydia was extremely satisfied with these assurances; and pleased\r\nherself with playing with his perplexities. In all his talk to her, he\r\nshowed but very faint ideas of anything which had not been received at\r\nthe ear; and closed his protestation to her by saying, that if he were\r\nto see Valentia and Barcelona, whom he supposed the most esteemed of\r\nall women, by the quarrel there was about them, he would never like any\r\nbut Lydia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. James's Coffee-house, August 15._\r\n\r\nWe have repeated advices of the entire defeat of the Swedish army\r\nnear Pultowa[57] on the 27th June, O.S., and letters from Berlin give\r\nthe following account of the remains of the Swedish army since the\r\nbattle: Prince Menzikoff being ordered to pursue the victory, came\r\nup with the Swedish army (which was left to the command of General\r\nLewenhaupt) on the 30th of June, O.S., on the banks of the Boristhenes;\r\nwhereupon he sent General Lewenhaupt a summons to submit to his present\r\nfortune: Lewenhaupt immediately despatched three general officers to\r\nthat prince, to treat about a capitulation; but the Swedes, though\r\nthey consisted of 15,000 men, were in so great want of provision\r\nand ammunition, that they were obliged to surrender themselves at\r\ndiscretion. His Czarish Majesty despatched an express to General Goltz,\r\nwith an account of these particulars, and also with instructions to\r\nsend out detachments of his cavalry to prevent the King of Sweden's\r\njoining his army in Poland. That prince made his escape with a small\r\nparty by swimming over the Boristhenes; and it was thought, he designed\r\nto retire into Poland by the way of Volhinia. Advices from Berne of\r\nthe 11th instant say, that the General Diet of the Helvetic Body held\r\nat Baden concluded on the 6th; but the deputies of the six cantons,\r\nwho are deputed to determine the affair of Tockenburg, continue their\r\napplication to that business, notwithstanding some new difficulties\r\nstarted by the Abbot of St. Gall. Letters from Geneva of the 9th say,\r\nthat the Duke of Savoy's cavalry had joined Count Thaun, as had also\r\ntwo Imperial regiments of hussars; and that his royal highness's army\r\nwas disposed in the following manner: the troops under the command of\r\nCount Thaun are extended from Constans to St. Peter de Albigni. Small\r\nparties are left in several posts from thence to Little St. Bernard, to\r\npreserve the communication with Piedmont by the Valley of Aosta. Some\r\nforces are also posted at Taloir, and in the Castle of Doin, on each\r\nside of the Lake of Anneci. General Rhebinder is encamped in the Valley\r\nof Oulx with 10,000 foot, and some detachments of horse: his troops are\r\nextended from Exilles to Mount Genevre, so that he may easily penetrate\r\ninto Dauphine on the least motion of the enemy; but the Duke of Berwick\r\ntakes all necessary precautions to prevent such an enterprise. That\r\nGeneral's headquarters are at Francin; and he hath disposed his army\r\nin several parties, to preserve a communication with the Maurienne and\r\nBriançon. He hath no provisions for his army but from Savoy; Provence\r\nand Dauphine being unable to supply him with necessaries. He left\r\ntwo regiments of dragoons at Annen, who suffered very much in the\r\nlate action at Tessons, where they lost 1500 who were killed on the\r\nspot, 4 standards, and 300 prisoners, among whom were 40 officers.\r\nThe last letters from the Duke of Marlborough's camp at Orchies of\r\nthe 19th instant advise, that Monsieur Ravignan being returned from\r\nthe French Court with an account, that the King of France refused to\r\nratify the capitulation for the surrender of the citadel of Tournay,\r\nthe approaches have been carried on with great vigour and success:\r\nour miners have discovered several of the enemy's mines, who have\r\nsprung divers others, which did little execution; but for the better\r\nsecurity of the troops, both assaults are carried on by the cautious\r\nway of sapping. On the 18th, the confederate army made a general forage\r\nwithout any loss. Marshal Villars continues in his former camp, and\r\napplies himself with great diligence in casting up new lines behind the\r\nold on the Scarp. The Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene designed to\r\nbegin a general review of the army on the 20th.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[54] \"Deceased\" (folio).\r\n\r\n[55] Roger Grant was sworn oculist and operator in ordinary to Queen\r\nAnne, September 27, 1710; and on the death of Sir William Read, he\r\nwas sworn oculist in ordinary to George I. in 1715 (_Weekly Packet_,\r\nNo. 159). He died in 1724. A pamphlet, published in 1709, price 2d.,\r\ncalled, \"A full and true Account of a Miraculous Cure of a Young Man\r\nin Newington, that was born Blind, and was in Five Minutes brought to\r\nperfect Sight. By Mr. Roger Grant, Oculist,\" was in reality intended to\r\nexpose Grant as an impostor. William Jones, son of Annabella Jones, of\r\nNewington, Surrey, was, in the twentieth year of his age, couched by\r\nGrant, on June 19, 1709. On Sunday, July 24, he went, we are told, to\r\nthe parish church of St. Mary, Newington, and requested the minister\r\nto offer up thanks for his recovery; and next day he and his mother\r\nwent to the minister to ask him to certify a statement to the effect\r\nthat Jones was born blind and now had his sight very well. The minister\r\nobjected to doing this, although Jones and his mother urged that Grant\r\nwould charge for the cure if they did not get the certificate. The\r\npamphlet states that at last they got the minister's signature forged,\r\nand then Grant published the certificate in the _Daily Courant_ for\r\nJuly 30, 1709. On August 16 another paper came out, stating that the\r\nminister was present at the operation. The minister told all who made\r\ninquiries the truth; that the boy was not born blind, but only with an\r\nimperfection in his sight; and that now he saw very little with the\r\nleft eye, and not at all with the right. On August 8, Grant got the\r\nmother to make an affidavit respecting her son's blindness and cure\r\nbefore a magistrate. This affidavit is printed in the \"British Apollo,\"\r\nvol. ii. No. 91 (January 20 to 23, 1710). The following advertisement\r\nis taken from the same periodical, vol. ii. No. 39 (August 5 to 10,\r\n1709): \"As it would be no less disrespectful and injurious to the\r\npublic, to conceal the merits of Mr. Grant, oculist; therefore, we,\r\nthe Minister, Churchwardens, and Overseers of the poor of the parish\r\nof St. Mary, Newington Butts, do certify, that William Jones, of the\r\nsame parish, aged twenty years, who was born blind, on his application\r\nto Mr. Grant aforesaid, who dwells in St. Christopher's Court, behind\r\nthe Royal Exchange, was by him couched on Wednesday, June 29, 1709,\r\nand by the blessing of God, on the skilful hand of Mr. Grant, the said\r\nJones, in five minutes' time, was brought to see, and at this time\r\nhath his sight very well. This case being so particularly remarkable,\r\nand gratisly performed, we do, therefore, give this public testimony\r\nunder our hands, this 25th of July, 1709.--Minister, William Taswell;\r\nChurchwardens, James Comber, William Dale; Overseers, Francis Trosse,\r\nWilliam Benskin, Walker Wood, John Ship.\" The Jones case is included\r\nin a list of Grant's cures, \"Account of some Cures,\" &c., printed on a\r\nfolio sheet which is supposed to have been issued in 1713 (Brit. Mus.\r\n1830, c. (18)). The pamphleteer from whom I have quoted, adds that\r\nGrant was bred up a cobbler, or, as some say, a tinker; and he was an\r\nAnabaptist preacher. Nichols says that \"Grant seems to have been more\r\ningenious and reputable than most of his brother and sister oculists;\r\nbut, if we may judge from his very numerous advertisements, he was not\r\nless vain, or less indelicate.\" A correspondent of the _Spectator_ (see\r\nNo. 472) bore testimony to the benefit he had himself derived from\r\nGrant, and said that many blind persons had been cured.\r\n\r\n[56] Dr. William Taswell (here called Caswell), king's scholar at\r\nWestminster, was elected student of Christ Church in 1670.

I. 85, 86.\r\n\r\n\r\n_White's Chocolate-house, August 17._\r\n\r\nThere is a young foreigner committed to my care, who puzzles me\r\nextremely in the questions he asks about the persons of figure we meet\r\nin public places. He has but very little of our language, and therefore\r\nI am mightily at a loss to express to him things, for which they have\r\nno word in that tongue to which he was born. It has been often my\r\nanswer, upon his asking, who such a fine gentleman is? that he is what\r\nwe call a \"sharper,\" and he wants my explication. I thought it would\r\nbe very unjust to tell him, he is the same the French call Coquin; the\r\nLatins, Nebulo; or the Greeks, #Raskal#.[58] For as custom is the most\r\npowerful of all laws, and that the order of men we call sharpers are\r\nreceived amongst us, not only with permission, but favour, I thought\r\nit unjust to use them like persons upon no establishment. Besides\r\nthat, it would be an unpardonable dishonour to our country, to let him\r\nleave us with an opinion, that our nobility and gentry kept company\r\nwith common thieves and cheats; I told him, they were a sort of tame\r\nhussars that were allowed in our cities, like the wild ones in our\r\ncamp, who had all the privileges belonging to us, but at the same time\r\nwere not tied to our discipline or laws. Aletheus, who is a gentleman\r\nof too much virtue for the age he lives in, would not let this matter\r\nbe thus palliated, but told my pupil, that he was to understand, that\r\ndistinction, quality, merit, and industry, were laid aside amongst\r\nus by the incursions of these civil hussars, who had got so much\r\ncountenance, that the breeding and fashion of the age turned their way\r\nto the ruin of order and economy in all places where they are admitted.\r\nBut Sophronius, who never falls into heat upon any subject, but applies\r\nproper language, temper, and skill, with which the thing in debate is\r\nto be treated, told the youth, that gentleman had spoken nothing, but\r\nwhat was literally true; but fell upon it with too much earnestness to\r\ngive a true idea of that sort of people he was declaiming against, or\r\nto remedy the evil which he bewailed: for the acceptance of these men\r\nbeing an ill which hath crept into the conversation part of our lives,\r\nand not into our constitution itself, it must be corrected where it\r\nbegan, and consequently is to be amended only by bringing raillery and\r\nderision upon the persons who are guilty, or converse with them. \"For\r\nthe sharpers,\" continued he, \"at present are not as formerly, under\r\nthe acceptation of pickpockets; but are by custom erected into a real\r\nand venerable body of men, and have subdued us to so very particular a\r\ndeference to them, that though they are known to be men without honour\r\nor conscience, no demand is called a debt of honour so indisputably\r\nas theirs. You may lose your honour to them, but they lay none against\r\nyou: as the priesthood in Roman Catholic countries can purchase what\r\nthey please for the Church, but they can alienate nothing from it. It\r\nis from this toleration, that sharpers are to be found among all sorts\r\nof assemblies and companies, and every talent amongst men is made use\r\nof by some one or other of the society for the good of their common\r\ncause: so that an unexperienced young gentleman is as often ensnared\r\nby his understanding as his folly: for who could be unmoved, to hear\r\nthe eloquent Dromio explain the constitution, talk in the key of Cato,\r\nwith the severity of one of the ancient sages, and debate the greatest\r\nquestion of State in a common chocolate or coffee-house; who could, I\r\nsay, hear this generous declamator, without being fired at his noble\r\nzeal, and becoming his professed follower, if he might be admitted.\r\nMonoculus'[59] gravity would be no less inviting to a beginner in\r\nconversation, and the snare of his eloquence would equally catch one\r\nwho had never seen an old gentleman so very wise, and yet so little\r\nsevere. Many other instances of extraordinary men among the brotherhood\r\nmight be produced; but every man who knows the town, can supply himself\r\nwith such examples without their being named.\" Will. Vafer, who is\r\nskilful at finding out the ridiculous side of a thing, and placing it\r\nin a new and proper light (though he very seldom talks), thought fit\r\nto enter into this subject. He has lately lost certain loose sums,\r\nwhich half the income of his estate will bring in within seven years:\r\nbesides which, he proposes to marry to set all right. He was therefore\r\nindolent enough to speak of this matter with great impartiality. \"When\r\nI look round me,\" said this easy gentleman, \"and consider in a just\r\nbalance us bubbles, elder brothers, whose support our dull fathers\r\ncontrived to depend upon certain acres; with the rooks, whose ancestors\r\nleft them the wide world; I cannot but admire their fraternity, and\r\ncontemn my own. Is not Jack Heyday much to be preferred to the knight\r\nhe has bubbled? Jack has his equipage, his wenches, and his followers:\r\nthe knight so far from a retinue, that he is almost one of Jack's.\r\nHowever, he is gay, you see, still; a florid outside--his habit speaks\r\nthe man--and since he must unbutton, he would not be reduced outwardly,\r\nbut is stripped to his upper coat. But though I have great temptation\r\nto it, I will not at this time give the history of the losing side, but\r\nspeak the effects of my thoughts, since the loss of my money, upon the\r\ngaining people. This ill fortune makes most men contemplative and given\r\nto reading; at least it has happened so to me; and the rise and fall of\r\nthe family of sharpers in all ages has been my contemplation.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI find, all times have had of this people; Homer, in his excellent\r\nheroic poem, calls them Myrmidons, who were a body who kept among\r\nthemselves, and had nothing to lose; therefore never spared either\r\nGreek or Trojan, when they fell in their way, upon a party. But there\r\nis a memorable verse which gives us an account of what broke that\r\nwhole body, and made both Greeks and Trojans masters of the secret\r\nof their warfare and plunder. There is nothing so pedantic as many\r\nquotations; therefore I shall inform you only, that in this battalion\r\nthere were two officers called Thersites and Pandarus; they were both\r\nless renowned for their beauty than their wit; but each had this\r\nparticular happiness, that they were plunged over head and ears in\r\nthe same water, which made Achilles invulnerable; and had ever after\r\ncertain gifts which the rest of the world were never to enjoy. Among\r\nothers, they were never to know they were the most dreadful to the\r\nsight of all mortals, never to be diffident of their own abilities,\r\nnever to blush, or ever to be wounded but by each other. Though some\r\nhistorians say, gaming began among the Lydians to divert hunger, I\r\ncould cite many authorities to prove it had its rise at the siege of\r\nTroy; and that Ulysses won the sevenfold shield at hazard. But be that\r\nas it may, the ruin of the corps of the myrmidons proceeded from a\r\nbreach between Thersites and Pandarus. The first of these was leader\r\nof a squadron, wherein the latter was but a private man; but having\r\nall the good qualities necessary for a partisan, he was the favourite\r\nof his officer. But the whole history of the several changes in the\r\norder of sharpers, from those myrmidons to our modern men of address\r\nand plunder, will require that we consult some ancient manuscripts.\r\nAs we make these inquiries, we shall diurnally communicate them to\r\nthe public, that the knights of the industry may be better understood\r\nby the good people of England. These sort of men in some ages, were\r\nsycophants and flatterers only, and were endued with arts of life to\r\ncapacitate them for the conversation of the rich and great; but now\r\nthe bubble courts the impostor, and pretends at the utmost to be but\r\nhis equal. To clear up the reasons and causes in such revolutions,\r\nand the alteration of conduct between fools and cheats, shall be one\r\nof our labours for the good of this kingdom. How therefore pimps,\r\nfootmen, fiddlers, and lackeys, are elevated into companions in this\r\npresent age, shall be accounted for from the influence of the planet\r\nMercury[60] on this island; the ascendency of which sharper over Sol,\r\nwho is a patron of the Muses, and all honest professions, has been\r\nnoted by the learned Job Gadbury[61] to be the cause, that cunning and\r\ntrick are more esteemed than art and science. It must be allowed also,\r\nto the memory of Mr. Partridge, late of Cecil Street in the Strand,\r\nthat in his answer to an horary question, at what hour of the night\r\nto set a foxtrap in June 1705, he has largely discussed, under the\r\ncharacter of Reynard, the manner of surprising all sharpers as well as\r\nhim.

I. 85, 86.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will's Coffee-house, August 19._\r\n\r\nI was this evening representing a complaint sent me out of the country\r\nfrom Emilia. She says, her neighbours there have so little sense of\r\nwhat a refined lady of the town is, that she, who was a celebrated wit\r\nin London, is in that dull part of the world in so little esteem, that\r\nthey call her in their base style a tongue-pad. Old Truepenny bid me\r\nadvise her to keep her wit till she comes to town again, and admonish\r\nher, that both wit and breeding are local; for a fine Court lady is\r\nas awkward among country housewives, as one of them would appear in a\r\ndrawing-room. It is therefore the most useful knowledge one can attain\r\nat, to understand among what sort of men we make the best figure; for\r\nif there be a place where the beauteous and accomplished Emilia is\r\nunacceptable, it is certainly a vain endeavour to attempt pleasing\r\nin all conversations. Here is Will. Ubi, who is so thirsty after the\r\nreputation of a companion, that his company is for anybody that will\r\naccept of it; and for want of knowing whom to choose for himself, is\r\nnever chosen by others. There is a certain chastity of behaviour which\r\nmakes a man desirable, and which, if he transgresses, his wit will have\r\nthe same fate with Delia's beauty, which no one regards, because all\r\nknow it is within their power. The best course Emilia can take, is, to\r\nhave less humility; for if she could have as good an opinion of herself\r\nfor having every quality, as some of her neighbours have of themselves\r\nwith one, she would inspire even them with a sense of her merit, and\r\nmake that carriage (which is now the subject of their derision) the\r\nsole object of their imitation. Till she has arrived at this value of\r\nherself, she must be contented with the fate of that uncommon creature,\r\na woman too humble.\r\n\r\n\r\n_White's Chocolate-house, August 19._\r\n\r\nSince my last, I have received a letter from Tom Trump, to desire that\r\nI would do the fraternity of gamesters the justice to own, that there\r\nare notorious sharpers who are not of their class.

I must confess, there appeared some reason in what\r\nhe asserted; and he met me since, and accosted me in the following\r\nmanner: \"It is wonderful to me, Mr. Bickerstaff, that you can pretend\r\nto be a man of penetration, and fall upon us knights of the industry\r\nas the wickedest of mortals, when there are so many who live in the\r\nconstant practice of baser methods unobserved. You cannot (though\r\nyou know the story of myself and the North Briton) but allow I am an\r\nhonester man than Will. Coppersmith, for all his great credit among\r\nthe Lombards. I get my money by men's follies, and he gets his by\r\ntheir distresses. The declining merchant communicates his griefs to\r\nhim, and he augments them by extortion. If therefore regard is to be\r\nhad to the merit of the persons we injure, who is the more blamable,\r\nhe that oppresses an unhappy man, or he that cheats a foolish one? All\r\nmankind are indifferently liable to adverse strokes of fortune; and he\r\nwho adds to them, when he might relieve them, is certainly a worse\r\nsubject, than he who unburdens a man whose prosperity is unwieldy to\r\nhim. Besides all which, he that borrows of Coppersmith, does it out of\r\nnecessity; he that plays with me, does it out of choice.\" I allowed\r\nTrump there are men as bad as himself, which is the height of his\r\npretensions; and must confess, that Coppersmith is the most wicked and\r\nimpudent of all sharpers: a creature that cheats with credit, and is\r\na robber in the habit of a friend. The contemplation of this worthy\r\nperson made me reflect on the wonderful successes I have observed men\r\nof the meanest capacities meet with in the world, and recollected\r\nan observation I once heard a sage man make, which was, that he had\r\nobserved, that in some professions, the lower the understanding, the\r\ngreater the capacity. I remember, he instanced that of a banker, and\r\nsaid, \"That the fewer appetites, passions, and ideas a man had, he was\r\nthe better for his business.\" There is little Sir Tristram,[66] without\r\nconnection in his speech, or so much as common sense, has arrived by\r\nhis own natural parts at one of the greatest estates amongst us. But\r\nhonest Sir Tristram knows himself to be but a repository for cash: he\r\nis just such a utensil as his iron chest, and may rather be said to\r\nhold money, than possess it. There is nothing so pleasant as to be in\r\nthe conversation of these wealthy proficients. I had lately the honour\r\nto drink half a pint with Sir Tristram, Harry Coppersmith, and Giles\r\nTwoshoes. These wags give one another credit in discourse according to\r\ntheir purses; they jest by the pound, and make answers as they honour\r\nbills. Without vanity, I thought myself the prettiest fellow of the\r\ncompany; but I had no manner of power over one muscle in their faces,\r\nthough they sneered at every word spoken by each other. Sir Tristram\r\ncalled for a pipe of tobacco; and telling us tobacco was a pot-herb,\r\nbid the drawer bring in the other half-pint. Twoshoes laughed at the\r\nknight's wit without moderation. I took the liberty to say, it was but\r\na pun. \"A pun!\" says Coppersmith: \"you would be a better man by £10,000\r\nif you could pun like Sir Tristram.\" With that, they all burst out\r\ntogether. The queer curs maintained this style of dialogue till we had\r\ndrunk our quarts apiece by half-pints. All I could bring away with me,\r\nis, that Twoshoes is not worth £20,000; for his mirth, though he was as\r\ninsipid as either of the others, had no more effect upon the company,\r\nthan if he had been a bankrupt.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, August 19._\r\n\r\nI have heard, it has been advised by a Diocesan to his inferior clergy,\r\nthat instead of broaching opinions of their own, and uttering doctrines\r\nwhich may lead themselves and hearers into errors, they would read some\r\nof the most celebrated sermons printed by others for the instruction\r\nof their congregations. In imitation of such preachers at second-hand,\r\nI shall transcribe from Bruyère one of the most elegant pieces of\r\nraillery and satire which I have ever read. He describes the French, as\r\nif speaking of a people not yet discovered, in the air and style of a\r\ntraveller.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I have heard talk of a country where the old men are gallant, polite\r\nand civil: the young men, on the contrary, stubborn, wild, without\r\neither manners or civility. They are free from passion for women, at\r\nthe age when in other countries they begin to feel it; and prefer\r\nbeasts, victuals, and ridiculous amours, before them. Amongst these\r\npeople, he is sober who is never drunk with anything but wine; the\r\ntoo frequent use of it has rendered it flat and insipid to them: they\r\nendeavour by brandy, and other strong liquors, to quicken their taste,\r\nalready extinguished, and want nothing to complete their debauches,\r\nbut to drink aqua fortis. The women of that country hasten the decay\r\nof their beauty, by their artifices to preserve it: they paint their\r\ncheeks, eyebrows, and shoulders, which they lay open, together with\r\ntheir breasts, arms and ears, as if they were afraid to hide those\r\nplaces which they think will please, and never think they show enough\r\nof them. The physiognomies of the people of that country are not at\r\nall neat, but confused and embarrassed with a bundle of strange hair,\r\nwhich they prefer before their natural: with this they weave something\r\nto cover their heads, which descends half-way down their bodies, hides\r\ntheir features, and hinders you from knowing men by their faces. This\r\nnation has besides this, their God and their king. The grandees go\r\nevery day at a certain hour to a temple they call a church: at the\r\nupper end of that temple there stands an altar consecrated to their\r\nGod, where the priest celebrates some mysteries which they call holy,\r\nsacred and tremendous. The great men make a vast circle at the foot\r\nof the altar, standing with their backs to the priest and the holy\r\nmysteries, and their faces erected towards their king, who is seen on\r\nhis knees upon a throne, and to whom they seem to direct the desires of\r\ntheir hearts, and all their devotion. However, in this custom there is\r\nto be remarked a sort of subordination; for the people appear adoring\r\ntheir prince and their prince adoring God. The inhabitants of this\r\nregion call it----It is from forty-eight degrees of latitude, and more\r\nthan eleven hundred leagues by sea, from the Iroquois and Hurons.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLetters from Hampstead[67] say, there is a coxcomb arrived there, of\r\na kind which is utterly new. The fellow has courage, which he takes\r\nhimself to be obliged to give proofs of every hour he lives. He is ever\r\nfighting with the men, and contradicting the women. A lady who sent him\r\nto me, superscribed him with this description out of Suckling:\r\n\r\n    \"_I am a man of war and might,\r\n    And know thus much, that I can fight,\r\n    Whether I am in the wrong or right,\r\n                Devoutly._\r\n\r\n    \"_No woman under heaven I fear,\r\n    New oaths I can exactly swear;\r\n    And forty healths my brains will bear,\r\n                Most stoutly._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[65] A plum is £100,000.\r\n\r\n[66] Sir Francis Child, according to the annotator mentioned in a note\r\nto No. 4.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, August 20_, to _Tuesday, August 23, 1709_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_White's Chocolate-house, August 22._\r\n\r\nPoor Cynthio[68] (who does me the honour to talk to me now and then\r\nvery freely of his most secret thoughts, and tells me his most private\r\nfrailties) owned to me, that though he is in his very prime of life,\r\nlove had killed all his desires, and he was now as much to be trusted\r\nwith a fine lady, as if he were eighty. \"That one passion for Clarissa\r\nhas taken up,\" said he, \"my whole soul, and all my idle flames are\r\nextinguished, as you may observe, ordinary fires are often put out\r\nby the sunshine.\" This was a declaration not to be made, but upon\r\nthe highest opinion of a man's sincerity; yet as much a subject of\r\nraillery as such a speech would be, it is certain, that chastity is a\r\nnobler quality, and as much to be valued in men as in women. The mighty\r\nScipio, who (as Bluffe[69] says in the comedy) was a pretty fellow in\r\nhis time, was of this mind, and is celebrated for it by an author of\r\ngood sense. When he lived, wit, and humour, and raillery, and public\r\nsuccess, were at as high a pitch in Rome, as at present in England; yet\r\nI believe, there was no man in those days thought that general at all\r\nridiculous in his behaviour in the following account of him: Scipio,\r\nat four and twenty years of age,[70] had obtained a great victory,\r\nand a multitude of prisoners of each sex, and all conditions, fell\r\ninto his possession: among others, an agreeable virgin in her early\r\nbloom and beauty. He had too sensible a spirit to see the most lovely\r\nof all objects without being moved with passion: besides which, there\r\nwas no obligation of honour or virtue to restrain his desires towards\r\none who was his by the fortune of war. But a noble indignation, and\r\na sudden sorrow, which appeared in her countenance, when a conqueror\r\ncast his eyes upon her, raised his curiosity to know her story. He was\r\ninformed, that she was a lady of the highest condition in that country,\r\nand contracted to Indibilis, a man of merit and quality. The generous\r\nRoman soon placed himself in the condition of that unhappy man, who was\r\nto lose so charming a bride; and though a youth, a bachelor, a lover,\r\nand a conqueror, immediately resolved to resign all the invitations\r\nof his passion, and the rights of his power, to restore her to her\r\ndestined husband. With this purpose he commanded her parents and\r\nrelations, as well as her husband, to attend him at an appointed time.\r\nWhen they met, and were waiting for the general, my author frames to\r\nhimself the different concern of an unhappy father, a despairing lover,\r\nand a tender mother, in the several persons who were so related to\r\nthe captive. But for fear of injuring the delicate circumstances with\r\nan old translation, I shall proceed to tell you, that Scipio appears\r\nto them, and leads in his prisoner into their presence. The Romans\r\n(as noble as they were) seemed to allow themselves a little too much\r\ntriumph over the conquered; therefore, as Scipio approached, they all\r\nthrew themselves on their knees, except the lover of the lady: but\r\nScipio observing in him a manly sullenness, was the more inclined to\r\nfavour him, and spoke to him in these words: \"It is not the manner of\r\nthe Romans to use all the power they justly may: we fight not to ravage\r\ncountries, or break through the ties of humanity; I am acquainted\r\nwith your worth, and your interest in this lady: fortune has made me\r\nyour master; but I desire to be your friend. This is your wife; take\r\nher, and may the gods bless you with her. But far be it from Scipio\r\nto purchase a loose and momentary pleasure at the rate of making an\r\nhonest man unhappy.\" Indibilis' heart was too full to make him any\r\nanswer, but he threw himself at the feet of the general and wept aloud.\r\nThe captive lady fell into the same posture, and they both remained\r\nso till the father burst into the following words: \"O divine Scipio!\r\nThe gods have given you more than human virtue. O glorious leader! O\r\nwondrous youth! Does not that obliged virgin give you, while she prays\r\nto the gods for your prosperity, and thinks you sent down from them,\r\nraptures, above all the transports which you could have reaped from\r\nthe possession of her injured person?\" The temperate Scipio answered\r\nhim without much emotion, and, saying, \"Father, be a friend to Rome,\"\r\nretired. An immense sum was offered as her ransom; but he sent it to\r\nher husband, and smiling, said, \"This is a trifle after what I have\r\ngiven him already; but let Indibilis know, that chastity at my age is\r\na much more difficult virtue to practise than generosity.\" I observed,\r\nCynthio was very much taken with my narrative; but told me, this was a\r\nvirtue that would bear but a very inconsiderable figure in our days.\r\nHowever I took the liberty to say, that we ought not to lose our ideas\r\nof things, though we had debauched our true relish in our practice. For\r\nafter we have done laughing, solid virtue will keep its place in men's\r\nopinions: and though custom made it not so scandalous as it ought\r\nto be, to ensnare innocent women, and triumph in the falsehood; such\r\nactions as we have here related, must be accounted true gallantry, and\r\nrise the higher in our esteem, the farther they are removed from our\r\nimitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will's Coffee-house, August 22._\r\n\r\nA man would be apt to think in this laughing town, that it were\r\nimpossible a thing so exploded as speaking hard words should be\r\npractised by any one that had ever seen good company; but as if there\r\nwere a standard in our minds as well as bodies, you see very many just\r\nwhere they were twenty years ago, and more they cannot, will not arrive\r\nat. Were it not thus, the noble Martius would not be the only man in\r\nEngland whom nobody can understand, though he talks more than any man\r\nelse, Will. Dactyle the epigrammatist, Jack Comma the grammarian, Nick\r\nCross-grain who writes anagrams, and myself, made a pretty company at\r\na corner of this room, and entered very peaceably upon a subject fit\r\nenough for us; which was, the examination of the force of the particle\r\n\"for,\" when Martius joined us. He being well known to us all, asked\r\nwhat we were upon? For he had a mind to consummate the happiness of\r\nthe day, which had been spent among the stars of the first magnitude,\r\namong the men of letters; and therefore, to put a period to it, as he\r\nhad commenced it, he should be glad to be allowed to participate of the\r\npleasure of our society. I told him the subject. \"Faith, gentlemen,\"\r\nsaid Martius, \"your subject is humble; and if you would give me leave\r\nto elevate the conversation, I should humbly offer, that you would\r\nenlarge your inquiries to the word 'forasmuch': for though I take\r\nit,\" said he, \"to be but one word; yet, the particle 'much' implying\r\nquantity, the particle 'as' similitude, it will be greater, and\r\nmore like ourselves, to treat of 'forasmuch.'\" Jack Comma is always\r\nserious, and answered, \"Martius, I must take the liberty to say, that\r\nyou have fallen into all this error and profuse manner of speech by a\r\ncertain hurry in your imagination, for want of being more exact in the\r\nknowledge of the parts of speech; and it is so with all men who have\r\nnot well studied the particle 'for.' You have spoken 'for' without\r\nmaking any inference, which is the great use of that particle. There is\r\nno manner of force in your observation of quantity and similitude in\r\nthe syllables 'as' and 'much.' But it is ever the fault of men of great\r\nwit to be incorrect; which evil they run into by an indiscreet use of\r\nthe word 'for.' Consider all the books of controversy which have been\r\nwritten, and I'll engage you will observe, that all the debate lies in\r\nthis point, whether they brought in 'for' in a just manner, or forced\r\nit in for their own use, rather than as understanding the use of the\r\nword itself? There is nothing like familiar instances: you have heard\r\nthe story of the Irishman, who reading, 'Money for Live Hair,' took a\r\nlodging and expected to be paid for living at that house. If this man\r\nhad known 'for' was in that place, of a quite different signification\r\nfrom the particle 'to,' he could not have fallen into the mistake of\r\ntaking 'live' for what the Latins call _vivere_, or rather _habitare_\"\r\nMartius seemed at a loss; and admiring his profound learning, wished\r\nhe had been bred a scholar, for he did not take the scope of his\r\ndiscourse. This wise debate, of which we had much more, made me reflect\r\nupon the difference of their capacities, and wonder that there could\r\nbe as it were a diversity in men's genius for nonsense; that one\r\nshould bluster, while another crept in absurdities. Martius moves\r\nlike a blind man, lifting his legs higher than the ordinary way of\r\nstepping; and Comma, like one who is only short-sighted, picking his\r\nway when he should be marching on. Want of learning makes Martius a\r\nbrisk entertaining fool, and gives himself a full scope; but that\r\nwhich Comma has, and calls learning, makes him diffident, and curb his\r\nnatural misunderstanding, to the great loss of the men of raillery.\r\nThis conversation confirmed me in the opinion, that learning usually\r\ndoes but improve in us what nature endowed us with. He that wants good\r\nsense, is unhappy in having it, for he has thereby only more ways of\r\nexposing himself; and he that has sense, knows that learning is not\r\nknowledge, but rather the art of using it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. James's Coffee-house, August 22._\r\n\r\nWe[71] have undoubted intelligence of the defeat of the King of Sweden;\r\nand that prince (who for some years had hovered like an approaching\r\ntempest, and was looked up at by all the nations of Europe, which\r\nseemed to expect their fate according to the course he should take),\r\nis now, in all probability, an unhappy exile, without the common\r\nnecessaries of life. His Czarish Majesty treats his prisoners with\r\ngreat gallantry and distinction. Count Rheinsfeldt has had particular\r\nmarks of his Majesty's esteem, for his merit and services to his\r\nmaster; but Count Piper, whom his Majesty believes author of the\r\nmost violent councils into which his prince entered, is disarmed and\r\nentertained accordingly. That decisive battle was ended at nine in the\r\nmorning, and all the Swedish generals dined with the Czar that very\r\nday, and received assurances that they should find Muscovy was not\r\nunacquainted with the laws of honour and humanity.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[68] Lord Hinchinbroke; see Nos. 5, 22, 35.\r\n\r\n[69] Captain Bluffe, in Congreve's \"Old Bachelor,\" act ii. sc. 2:\r\n\"Faith, Hannibal was a very pretty fellow; but, Sir Joseph, comparisons\r\nare odious; Hannibal was a very pretty fellow in those days, it must\r\nbe granted; but, alas, sir, were he alive now, he would be nothing,\r\nnothing in the earth.\"\r\n\r\n[70] He was really 27 at this time.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, August 23_, to _Thursday, August 25, 1709_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_White's Chocolate-house, August 24._\r\n\r\nÆsop has gained to himself an immortal renown for figuring the manners,\r\ndesires, passions, and interests of men, by fables of beasts and birds:\r\nI shall in my future accounts of our modern heroes and wits, vulgarly\r\ncalled \"sharpers,\" imitate the method of that delightful moralist; and\r\nthink, I cannot represent those worthies more naturally than under the\r\nshadow of a pack of dogs; for this set of men are like them, made up\r\nof finders, lurchers, and setters. Some search for the prey, others\r\npursue others take it; and if it be worth it, they all come in at the\r\ndeath, and worry the carcass. It would require a most exact knowledge\r\nof the field, and the harbours where the deer lie, to recount all\r\nthe revolutions in the chase: but I am diverted from the train of my\r\ndiscourse of the fraternity about this town by letters from Hampstead,\r\nwhich give me an account, there is a late institution there, under the\r\nname of a raffling-shop, which is, it seems, secretly supported by a\r\nperson who is a deep practitioner in the law, and, out of tenderness\r\nof conscience, has, under the name of his maid Sisly, set up this\r\neasier way of conveyancing and alienating estates from one family to\r\nanother. He is so far from having an intelligence with the rest of the\r\nfraternity, that all the humbler cheats who appear there, are faced by\r\nthe partners in the bank, and driven off by the reflection of superior\r\nbrass. This notice is given to all the silly faces that pass that\r\nway, that they may not be decoyed in by the soft allurement of a fine\r\nlady, who is the sign to the pageantry. And at the same time Signior\r\nHawksly, who is the patron of the household, is desired to leave off\r\nthis interloping trade, or admit, as he ought to do, the knights of\r\nthe industry to their share in the spoil. But this little matter is\r\nonly by way of digression. Therefore to return to our worthies: the\r\npresent race of terriers and hounds would starve, were it not for the\r\nenchanted Actæon, who has kept the whole pack for many successions\r\nof hunting seasons. Actæon has long tracts of rich soil; but had the\r\nmisfortune in his youth to fall under the power of sorcery, and has\r\nbeen ever since, some parts of the year, a deer, and in some parts a\r\nman. While he is a man (such is the force of magic), he no sooner grows\r\nto such a bulk and fatness, but he is again turned into a deer, and\r\nhunted till he is lean; upon which he returns to his human shape. Many\r\narts have been tried, and many resolutions taken by Actæon himself,\r\nto follow such methods as would break the enchantment; but all have\r\nhitherto proved ineffectual. I have therefore, by midnight watchings\r\nand much care, found out, that there is no way to save him from the\r\njaws of his hounds, but to destroy the pack, which, by astrological\r\nprescience, I find I am destined to perform. For which end I have\r\nsent out my familiar, to bring me a list of all the places where they\r\nare harboured, that I may know where to sound my horn, and bring them\r\ntogether, and take an account of their haunts and their marks, against\r\nanother opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will's Coffee-house, August 24._\r\n\r\nThe author of the ensuing letter, by his name, and the quotations he\r\nmakes from the ancients, seems a sort of spy from the old world, whom\r\nwe moderns ought to be careful of offending; therefore I must be free,\r\nand own it a fair hit where he takes me, rather than disoblige him.[72]\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"Having a peculiar humour of desiring to be somewhat the better or\r\n     wiser for what I read, I am always uneasy when, in any profound\r\n     writer (for I read no others), I happen to meet with what I\r\n     cannot understand. When this falls out, it is a great grievance\r\n     to me that I am not able to consult the author himself about\r\n     his meaning; for commentators are a sect that has little share\r\n     in my esteem. Your elaborate writings have, among many others,\r\n     this advantage, that their author is still alive, and ready (as\r\n     his extensive charity makes us expect) to explain whatever may\r\n     be found in them too sublime for vulgar understandings. This,\r\n     sir, makes me presume to ask you, how the Hampstead hero's[73]\r\n     character could be perfectly new when the last letters came away,\r\n     and yet Sir John Suckling so well acquainted with it sixty years\r\n     ago? I hope, sir, you will not take this amiss: I can assure you,\r\n     I have a profound respect for you; which makes me write this,\r\n     with the same disposition with which Longinus bids us read Homer\r\n     and Plato. 'When in reading,' says he, 'any of those celebrated\r\n     authors, we meet with a passage to which we cannot well reconcile\r\n     our reasons, we ought firmly to believe, that were those great\r\n     wits present to answer for themselves, we should to our wonder\r\n     be convinced, that we only are guilty of the mistakes we before\r\n     attributed to them.' If you think fit to remove the scruple that\r\n     now torments me, it will be an encouragement to me to settle a\r\n     frequent correspondence with you, several things falling in my way\r\n     which would not, perhaps, be altogether foreign to your purpose,\r\n     and whereon your thoughts would be very acceptable to\r\n\r\n  \"Your most humble Servant,\r\n  OBADIAH GREENHAT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI own this is clean, and Mr. Greenhat has convinced me that I have writ\r\nnonsense; yet am I not at all offended at him.\r\n\r\n    _Scimus, et hanc veniam petimusque damusque vicissim._[74]\r\n\r\nThis is the true art of raillery, when a man turns another into\r\nridicule, and shows at the same time he is in good humour, and not\r\nurged by malice against the person he rallies. Obadiah Greenhat has\r\nhit this very well: for to make an apology to Isaac Bickerstaff, an\r\nunknown student and horary historian, as well as astrologer, and with\r\na grave face to say, he speaks of him by the same rules with which he\r\nwould treat Homer or Plato, is to place him in company where he cannot\r\nexpect to make a figure; and makes him flatter himself, that it is\r\nonly being named with them which renders him most ridiculous. I have\r\nnot known, and I am now past my grand climacteric, being sixty-four\r\nyears of age, according to my way of life, or rather (if you will allow\r\npunning in an old gentleman) according to my way of pastime; I say,\r\nold as I am, I have not been acquainted with many of the Greenhats.\r\nThere is indeed one Zedekiah Greenhat, who is lucky also in his way.\r\nHe has a very agreeable manner; for when he has a mind thoroughly to\r\ncorrect a man, he never takes from him anything, but he allows him\r\nsomething for it; or else, he blames him for things wherein he is not\r\ndefective, as well as for matters wherein he is. This makes a weak man\r\nbelieve he is in jest in the whole. The other day he told Beau Prim,\r\nwho is thought impotent, that his mistress had declared she would not\r\nhave him, because he was a sloven, and had committed a rape. The beau\r\nbit at the banter, and said very gravely, he thought to be clean was\r\nas much as was necessary; and that as to the rape, he wondered by what\r\nwitchcraft that should come to her ears; but it had indeed cost him\r\na hundred pounds to hush the affair. The Greenhats are a family with\r\nsmall voices and short arms, therefore they have power with none but\r\ntheir friends: they never call after those who run away from them, or\r\npretend to take hold of you if you resist. But it has been remarkable,\r\nthat all who have shunned their company, or not listened to them, have\r\nfallen into the hands of such as have knocked out their own brains, or\r\nbroken their bones. I have looked over our pedigree upon the receipt\r\nof this epistle, and find the Greenhats are akin to the Staffs. They\r\ndescend from Maudlin, the left-handed wife of Nehemiah Bickerstaff,\r\nin the reign of Harry II. And it is remarkable, that they are all\r\nleft-handed, and have always been very expert at single rapier. A man\r\nmust be very much used to their play to know how to defend himself; for\r\ntheir posture is so different from that of the right-handed, that you\r\nrun upon their swords if you push forward; and they are in with you,\r\nif you offer to fall back without keeping your guard. There have been\r\nother letters lately sent to me which relate to other people: among\r\nothers, some whom I have heretofore declared to be so, are deceased.\r\nI must not therefore break through rules so far, as to speak ill of\r\nthe dead. This maxim extends to all but the late Partridge, who still\r\ndenies his death. I am informed indeed by several, that he walks; but I\r\nshall with all convenient speed lay him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. James's Coffee-house, August 24._\r\n\r\nWe hear from Tournay, that on the night between the 22nd and 23rd, they\r\nwent on with their works in the enemy's mines, and levelled the earth\r\nwhich was taken out of them. The next day, at eight in the morning,\r\nwhen the French observed we were relieving our trenches, they sprung\r\na larger mine than any they had fired during this siege, which killed\r\nonly four private sentinels. The ensuing night, we had three men and\r\ntwo officers killed, as also seven men wounded. Between the 24th and\r\n25th, we repaired some works, which the enemy had ruined. On the next\r\nday, some of the enemy's magazines blew up; and it is thought they were\r\ndestroyed on purpose by some of their men, who are impatient of the\r\nhardships of the present service. There happened nothing remarkable for\r\ntwo or three days following. A deserter, who came out of the citadel on\r\nthe 27th, says, the garrison is brought to the utmost necessity; that\r\ntheir bread and water are both very bad; and that they were reduced to\r\neat horse-flesh. The manner of fighting in this siege has discovered a\r\ngallantry in our men unknown to former ages; their meeting with adverse\r\nparties underground, where every step is taken with apprehensions of\r\nbeing blown up with mines below them, or crushed by the fall of the\r\nearth above them, and all this acted in darkness, has something in it\r\nmore terrible than ever is met with in any other part of a soldier's\r\nduty. However, this is performed with great cheerfulness. In other\r\nparts of the war we have also good prospects: Count Thaun has taken\r\nAnnecy, and the Count de Merci marched into Franche Comté, while his\r\nElectoral Highness is much superior in number to Monsieur d'Harcourt;\r\nso that both on the side of Savoy and Germany, we have reason to expect\r\nvery suddenly some great event.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[72] This letter was by Swift, and is printed in Scott's edition of his\r\nworks.

[STEELE.[75]\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, August 25_, to _Saturday, August 27_, 1709.\r\n\r\n\r\n_White's Chocolate-house, August 26._\r\n\r\nTo proceed regularly in the history of my worthies, I ought to give\r\nyou an account of what has passed from day to day in this place; but a\r\nyoung fellow of my acquaintance has so lately been rescued out of the\r\nhands of the knights of the industry, that I rather choose to relate\r\nthe manner of his escape from them, and the uncommon way which was used\r\nto reclaim him, than to go on in my intended diary. You are to know\r\nthen, that Tom Wildair is a student of the Inner Temple, and has spent\r\nhis time, since he left the university for that place, in the common\r\ndiversions of men of fashion; that is to say, in whoring, drinking, and\r\ngaming. The two former vices he had from his father; but was led into\r\nthe last by the conversation of a partisan of the Myrmidons, who had\r\nchambers near him. His allowance from his father was a very plentiful\r\none for a man of sense, but as scanty for a modern fine gentleman.\r\nHis frequent losses had reduced him to so necessitous a condition,\r\nthat his lodgings were always haunted by impatient creditors, and\r\nall his thoughts employed in contriving low methods to support\r\nhimself, in a way of life from which he knew not how to retreat, and\r\nin which he wanted means to proceed. There is never wanting some\r\ngood-natured person to send a man an account of what he has no mind\r\nto hear; therefore many epistles were conveyed to the father of\r\nthis extravagant, to inform him of the company, the pleasures, the\r\ndistresses, and entertainments, in which his son passed his time. The\r\nold fellow received these advices with all the pain of a parent, but\r\nfrequently consulted his pillow to know how to behave himself on such\r\nimportant occasions, as the welfare of his son, and the safety of his\r\nfortune. After many agitations of mind, he reflected, that necessity\r\nwas the usual snare which made men fall into meanness, and that a\r\nliberal fortune generally made a liberal and honest mind; he resolved\r\ntherefore to save him from his ruin, by giving him opportunities of\r\ntasting what it is to be at ease, and enclosed to him the following\r\norder upon Sir Tristram Cash:[76]\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"Pray pay to Mr. Tho. Wildair, or order, the sum of one thousand\r\n     pounds, and place it to the account of,\r\n\r\n  \"Yours,\r\n  HUMPHREY WILDAIR.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTom was so astonished at the receipt of this order, that though he knew\r\nit to be his father's hand, and that he had always large sums at Sir\r\nTristram's; yet a thousand pounds was a trust of which his conduct had\r\nalways made him appear so little capable, that he kept his note by him,\r\ntill he writ to his father the following letter:\r\n\r\n     \"HONOURED FATHER,\r\n\r\n     \"I have received an order under your hand for a thousand pounds,\r\n     in words at length, and I think I could swear it is your hand. I\r\n     have looked it over and over twenty thousand times. There is in\r\n     plain letters, T, H, O, U, S, A, N, D,: and after it, the letters\r\n     P, O, U, N, D, S. I have it still by me, and shall, I believe,\r\n     continue reading it till I hear from you.\"\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman took no manner of notice of the receipt of his\r\nletter; but sent him another order for three thousand pounds more.\r\nHis amazement on this second letter was unspeakable. He immediately\r\ndouble-locked his door, and sat down carefully to reading and comparing\r\nboth his orders. After he had read them till he was half mad, he walked\r\nsix or seven turns in his chamber, then opens his door, then locks it\r\nagain; and to examine thoroughly this matter, he locks his door again,\r\nputs his table and chairs against it; then goes into his closet, and\r\nlocking himself in, read his notes over again about nineteen times,\r\nwhich did but increase his astonishment. Soon after, he began to\r\nrecollect many stories he had formerly heard of persons who had been\r\npossessed with imaginations and appearances which had no foundation\r\nin nature, but had been taken with sudden madness in the midst of a\r\nseeming clear and untainted reason. This made him very gravely conclude\r\nhe was out of his wits; and with a design to compose himself, he\r\nimmediately betakes him to his nightcap, with a resolution to sleep\r\nhimself into his former poverty and senses. To bed therefore he goes at\r\nnoonday, but soon rose again, and resolved to visit Sir Tristram upon\r\nthis occasion. He did so, and dined with the knight, expecting he would\r\nmention some advice from his father about paying him money; but no such\r\nthing being said, \"Look you, Sir Tristram,\" said he, \"you are to know,\r\nthat an affair has happened, which----\" \"Look you,\" says Tristram,\r\n\"I know, Mr. Wildair, you are going to desire me to advance; but the\r\nlate call of the bank, where I have not yet made my last payment, has\r\nobliged me----\" Tom interrupted him, by showing him the bill of a\r\nthousand pounds. When he had looked at it for a convenient time, and\r\nas often surveyed Tom's looks and countenance; \"Look you, Mr. Wildair,\r\na thousand pounds----\" Before he could proceed, he shows him the order\r\nfor three thousand more. Sir Tristram examined the orders at the light,\r\nand finding at the writing the name, there was a certain stroke in one\r\nletter, which the father and he had agreed should be to such directions\r\nas he desired might be more immediately honoured, he forthwith pays the\r\nmoney. The possession of four thousand pounds gave my young gentleman\r\na new train of thoughts: he began to reflect upon his birth, the great\r\nexpectations he was born to, and the unsuitable ways he had long\r\npursued. Instead of that unthinking creature he was before, he is now\r\nprovident, generous, and discreet. The father and son have an exact and\r\nregular correspondence, with mutual and unreserved confidence in each\r\nother. The son looks upon his father as the best tenant he could have\r\nin the country, and the father finds the son the most safe banker he\r\ncould have in the City.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will's Coffee-house, August 26._\r\n\r\nThere is not anything in nature so extravagant, but that you will find\r\none man or other that shall practise or maintain it; otherwise, Harry\r\nSpondee could not have made so long an harangue as he did here this\r\nevening concerning the force and efficacy of well-applied nonsense.\r\nAmong ladies, he positively averred, it was the most prevailing part of\r\neloquence; and had so little complaisance as to say, a woman is never\r\ntaken by her reason, but always by her passion. He proceeded to assert,\r\nthe way to move that, was only to astonish her. \"I know,\" continued\r\nhe, \"a very late instance of this; for being by accident in the next\r\nroom to Strephon, I could not help overhearing him as he made love to a\r\ncertain great lady's woman. The true method in your application to one\r\nof this second rank of understanding, is not to elevate and surprise,\r\nbut rather to elevate and amaze. Strephon is a perfect master in this\r\nkind of persuasion: his way is, to run over with a soft air a multitude\r\nof words, without meaning or connection, but such as do each of them\r\napart give a pleasing idea, though they have nothing to do with each\r\nother as he assembles them. After the common phrases of salutation,\r\nand making his entry into the room, I perceived he had taken the\r\nfair nymph's hand, and kissing it, said, 'Witness to my happiness ye\r\ngroves! Be still ye rivulets! Oh! woods, caves, fountains, trees,\r\ndales, mountains, hills, and streams! Oh! fairest, could you love\r\nme?' To which I overheard her answer, with a very pretty lisp, 'Oh!\r\nStrephon, you are a dangerous creature: why do you talk these tender\r\nthings to me? But you men of wit----' 'Is it then possible,' said the\r\nenamoured Strephon, 'that she regards my sorrows? Oh! Pity, thou balmy\r\ncure to an heart overloaded. If rapture, solicitation, soft desire,\r\nand pleasing anxiety----But still I live in the most afflicting of all\r\ncircumstances, doubt----Cannot my charmer name the place and moment?\r\n\r\n    _There all those joys insatiably to prove,\r\n    With which rich beauty feeds the glutton love._\r\n\r\nForgive me, madam, it is not that my heart is weary of its chain,\r\nbut----' This incoherent stuff was answered by a tender sigh, 'Why\r\ndo you put your wit to a weak woman?' Strephon saw he had made some\r\nprogress in her heart, and pursued it, by saying that he would\r\ncertainly wait upon her at such an hour near Rosamond's Pond;[77] and\r\nthen----The sylvian deities, and rural powers of the place, sacred\r\nand inviolable to love; love, the mover of all noble hearts, should\r\nhear his vows repeated by the streams and echoes. The assignation\r\nwas accordingly made.\" This style he calls the unintelligible method\r\nof speaking his mind; and I'll engage, had this gallant spoken plain\r\nEnglish, she had never understood him half so readily: for we may\r\ntake it for granted, that he'll be esteemed as a very cold lover, who\r\ndiscovers to his mistress that he is in his senses.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, August 26._\r\n\r\nThe following letter came to my hand, with a request to have the\r\nsubject recommended to our readers, particularly the smart fellows,\r\nwho are desired to repair to Major Touchhole,[78] who can help them to\r\nfirelocks that are only fit for exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Just ready for the Press_,\r\n\r\n\"Mars Triumphant, or, London's Glory: being the whole art of\r\nEncampment, with the method of embattling Armies, marching them off,\r\nposting the Officers, forming Hollow Squares, and the various Ways\r\nof paying the Salute with the Halfpike; as it was performed by the\r\nTrained-bands of London this year One thousand seven hundred and\r\nnine, in that Nursery of Bellona the Artillery-ground.[79] Wherein\r\nyou have a new method how to form a strong line of foot, with large\r\nintervals between each platoon, very useful to prevent the breaking in\r\nof horse.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, August 27_, to _Tuesday, August 30, 1709_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_White's Chocolate-house, August 29._\r\n\r\nAmong many phrases which have crept into conversation, especially\r\nof such company as frequent this place, there is not one which\r\nmisleads me more, than that of a fellow of a great deal of fire. This\r\nmetaphorical term, \"fire,\" has done much good in keeping coxcombs in\r\nawe of one another; but at the same time it has made them troublesome\r\nto everybody else. You see in the very air of a fellow of fire,\r\nsomething so expressive of what he would be at, that if it were not\r\nfor self-preservation, a man would laugh out. I had last night the\r\nfate to drink a bottle with two of these firemen, who are indeed\r\ndispersed like the myrmidons[80] in all quarters, and to be met with\r\namong those of the most different education. One of my companions was\r\na scholar with fire; the other a soldier of the same complexion. My\r\nlearned man would fall into disputes, and argue without any manner\r\nof provocation or contradiction: the other was decisive without\r\nwords, and would give a shrug or an oath to express his opinion. My\r\nlearned man was a mere scholar, and my man of war as mere a soldier.\r\nThe particularity of the first was ridiculous; that of the second,\r\nterrible. They were relations by blood, which in some measure moderated\r\ntheir extravagances towards each other: I gave myself up merely as a\r\nperson of no note in the company, but as if brought to be convinced,\r\nthat I was an inconsiderable thing, any otherwise than that they would\r\nshow each other to me, and make me spectator of the triumph they\r\nalternately enjoyed. The scholar has been very conversant with books,\r\nand the other with men only; which makes them both superficial: for\r\nthe taste of books is necessary to our behaviour in the best company,\r\nand the knowledge of men is required for a true relish of books: but\r\nthey have both fire, which makes one pass for a man of sense, and\r\nthe other for a fine gentleman. I found I could easily enough pass\r\nmy time with the scholar; for if I seemed not to do justice to his\r\nparts and sentiments, he pitied me, and let me alone. But the warrior\r\ncould not let it rest there; I must know all that happened within his\r\nshallow observations of the nature of the war: to all which he added,\r\nan air of laziness, and contempt of those of his companions who were\r\neminent for delighting in the exercise and knowledge of their duty.\r\nThus it is, that all the young fellows of much animal life, and little\r\nunderstanding, that repair to our armies, usurp upon the conversation\r\nof reasonable men, under the notion of having fire. The word has\r\nnot been of greater use to shallow lovers, to supply them with chat\r\nto their mistresses, than it has been to pretended men of pleasure\r\nto support them in being pert and dull, and saying of every fool of\r\ntheir order, \"Such a one has fire.\" There is a Colonel Truncheon, who\r\nmarches with divisions ready on all occasions; a hero who never doubted\r\nin his life, but is ever positively fixed in the wrong, not out of\r\nobstinate opinion, but invincible stupidity. It is very unhappy for\r\nthis latitude of London, that it is possible for such as can learn\r\nonly fashion, habit, and a set of common phrases of salutation, to\r\npass with no other accomplishments in this nation of freedom for men\r\nof conversation and sense. All these ought to pretend to, is, not to\r\noffend; but they carry it so far, as to be negligent, whether they\r\noffend or not; for they have fire. But their force differs from true\r\nspirit, as much as a vicious from a mettlesome horse. A man of fire\r\nis a general enemy to all the waiters where you drink, is the only\r\nman affronted at the company's being neglected, and makes the drawers\r\nabroad, his _valet-de-chambre_ and footman at home, know, he is not\r\nto be provoked without danger. This is not the fire that animates the\r\nnoble Marinus,[81] a youth of good nature, affability, and moderation.\r\nHe commands his ship, as an intelligence moves its orb; he is the\r\nvital life, and his officers the limbs of the machine. His vivacity is\r\nseen in doing all the offices of life with readiness of spirit, and\r\npropriety in the manner of doing them. To be ever active in laudable\r\npursuits, is the distinguishing character of a man of merit; while the\r\ncommon behaviour of every gay coxcomb of fire is to be confidently in\r\nthe wrong, and dare to persist in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will's Coffee-house, August 29._\r\n\r\nIt is a common objection against writings of a satirical mixture, that\r\nthey hurt men in their reputations, and consequently in their fortunes\r\nand possessions; but a gentleman who frequents this room declared, he\r\nwas of opinion it ought to be so, provided such performances had their\r\nproper restrictions. The greatest evils in human society are such as\r\nno law can come at; as in the case of ingratitude, where the manner of\r\nobliging very often leaves the benefactor without means of demanding\r\njustice, though that very circumstance should be the more binding to\r\nthe person who has received the benefit. On such an occasion, shall it\r\nbe possible for the malefactor to escape?\r\n\r\nAnd is it not lawful to set marks upon persons who live within the\r\nlaw, and do base things? Shall not we use the same protection of those\r\nlaws to punish them, which they have to defend themselves? We shall\r\ntherefore take it for a very moral action to find a good appellation\r\nfor offenders, and to turn them into ridicule under feigned names.\r\nI am advertised by a letter of August the 25th, that the name of\r\nCoppersmith[82] has very much wanted explanation in the city, and by\r\nthat means unjustly given, by those who are conscious they deserve\r\nit themselves, to an honest and worthy citizen[83]--belonging to the\r\nCopper Office; but that word is framed out of a moral consideration\r\nof wealth amongst men, whereby he that has gotten any part of it by\r\ninjustice and extortion, is to be thought in the eye of virtuous men\r\nso much the poorer for such gain. Thus all the gold which is torn from\r\nour neighbours, by making advantage of their wants, is copper; and\r\nI authorise the Lombards to distinguish themselves accordingly. All\r\nthe honest, who make a reasonable profit, both for the advantage of\r\nthemselves and those they deal with, are goldsmiths; but those who tear\r\nunjustly all they can, coppersmiths. At the same time I desire him who\r\nis most guilty, to sit down satisfied with riches and contempt, and\r\nbe known by the title of the Coppersmith; as being the chief of that\r\nrespected, contemptible fraternity.\r\n\r\nThis is the case of all others mentioned in our lucubrations,\r\nparticularly of Stentor,[84] who goes on in his vociferations at St.\r\nPaul's with so much obstinacy, that he has received admonition from\r\nSt. Peter's for it from a person of eminent wit and piety;[85] but who\r\nis by old age reduced to the infirmity of sleeping at a service, to\r\nwhich he had been fifty years attentive, and whose death, whenever it\r\nhappens, may, with that of the saints, well be called, falling asleep;\r\nfor the innocence of his life makes him expect it as indifferently as\r\nhe does his ordinary rest. This gives him a cheerfulness of spirit to\r\nrally his own weakness, and hath made him write to Stentor to hearken\r\nto my admonitions. \"Brother Stentor,\" said he, \"for the repose of the\r\nchurch, hearken to Bickerstaff, and consider, that while you are so\r\ndevout at St. Paul's, we cannot sleep for you at St. Peter's.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, August 29._\r\n\r\nThere has been lately sent me a much harder question than was ever yet\r\nput to me since I professed astrology; to wit, how far, and to what\r\nage, women ought to make their beauty their chief concern? The regard\r\nand care of their faces and persons are as variously to be considered,\r\nas their complexions themselves differ; but if one may transgress\r\nagainst the careful practice of the fair sex so much as to give an\r\nopinion against it, I humbly presume, that less care, better applied,\r\nwould increase their empire, and make it last as long as life. Whereas\r\nnow, from their own example, we take our esteem of their merit; for it\r\nis very just, that she who values herself only on her beauty, should\r\nbe regarded by others on no other consideration. There is certainly\r\na liberal and pedantic education among women as well as men, and the\r\nmerit lasts accordingly. She therefore that is bred with freedom,\r\nand in good company, considers men according to their respective\r\ncharacters and distinctions; while she that is locked up from such\r\nobservations, will consider her father's butler not as a butler, but\r\nas a man. In like manner, when men converse with women, the well-bred\r\nand intelligent are looked upon with an observation suitable to their\r\ndifferent talents and accomplishments, without respect to their sex;\r\nwhile a mere woman can be observed under no consideration but that of a\r\nwoman; and there can be but one reason for placing any value upon her,\r\nor losing time in her company. Wherefore I am of opinion, that the rule\r\nfor pleasing long, is, to obtain such qualifications as would make them\r\nso were they not women. Let the beauteous Cleomira then show us her\r\nreal face, and know, that every stage of life has its peculiar charms,\r\nand that there is no necessity for fifty to be fifteen: that childish\r\ncolouring of her cheeks is as ungraceful, as that shape would have been\r\nwhen her face wore its real countenance. She has sense, and ought to\r\nknow, that if she will not follow nature, nature will follow her. Time\r\nthen has made that person, which had (when I visited her grandfather)\r\nan agreeable bloom, sprightly air, and soft utterance, now no less\r\ngrateful in a lovely aspect, an awful manner, and maternal wisdom. But\r\nher heart was so set upon her first character, that she neglects and\r\nrepines at her present; not that she is against a more staid conduct\r\nin others, for she recommends gravity, circumspection, and severity of\r\ncountenance, to her daughter. Thus, against all chronology, the girl\r\nis the sage, the mother the fine lady. But these great evils proceed\r\nfrom an unaccountable wild method in the education of the better half\r\nof the world, the women. We have no such thing as a standard for good\r\nbreeding. I was the other day at my Lady Wealthy's, and asked one of\r\nher daughters, how she did? She answered, she never conversed with men.\r\nThe same day I visited at Lady Plantwell's, and asked her daughter the\r\nsame question. She answers, \"What's that to you, you old thief?\" and\r\ngives me a slap on the shoulders. I defy any man in England, except\r\nhe knows the family before he enters, to be able to judge whether he\r\nshall be agreeable or not, when he comes into it. You find either some\r\nodd old woman, who is permitted to rule as long as she lives, in hopes\r\nof her death, and to interrupt all things; or some impertinent young\r\nwoman, who will talk sillily upon the strength of looking beautifully.\r\nI will not answer for it, but that it may be, that I (like all other\r\nold fellows) have a fondness for the fashions and manners which\r\nprevailed when I was young and in fashion myself: but certain it is,\r\nthat the taste of grace and beauty is very much lowered! The fine\r\nwomen they show me nowadays, are at best but pretty girls to me, who\r\nhave seen Sacharissa,[86] when all the world repeated the poems she\r\ninspired; and Villaria,[87] when a youthful king was her subject. The\r\nthings you follow and make songs on now, should be sent to knit, or sit\r\ndown to bobbing or bone-lace: they are indeed neat, and so are their\r\nsempstresses; they are pretty, and so are their handmaids. But that\r\ngraceful motion, that awful mien, and that winning attraction, which\r\ngrew upon them from the thoughts and conversations they met with in my\r\ntime, are now no more seen. They tell me I am old: I am glad I am so;\r\nfor I don't like your present young ladies. Those among us who do set\r\nup for anything of decorum, do so mistake the matter, that they offend\r\non the other side. Five young ladies who are of no small fame for their\r\ngreat severity of manners and exemplary behaviour, would lately go\r\nnowhere with their lovers but to an organ-loft in a church, where they\r\nhad a cold treat, and some few opera songs, to their great refreshment\r\nand edification. Whether these prudent persons had not been as much so\r\nif this had been done at a tavern, is not very hard to determine. It is\r\nsuch silly starts and incoherences which undervalue the beauteous sex,\r\nand puzzle us in our choice of sweetness of temper and simplicity of\r\nmanners, which are the only lasting charms of woman. But I must leave\r\nthis important subject at present, for some matters which press for\r\npublication; as you will observe in the following letter:\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"It is natural for distant relations to claim kindred with a\r\n     rising family; though at this time, zeal to my country, not\r\n     interest, calls me out. The City forces[88] being shortly to take\r\n     the field, all good Protestants would be pleased that their arms\r\n     and valour should shine with equal lustre. A council of war was\r\n     lately held, the Honourable Colonel Mortar being president. After\r\n     many debates, it was unanimously resolved, that Major Blunder,\r\n     a most expert officer, should be detached for Birmingham to buy\r\n     arms, and to prove his firelocks on the spot, as well to prevent\r\n     expense, as disappointment in the day of battle. The major\r\n     being a person of consummate experience, was invested with a\r\n     discretionary power. He knew from ancient story, that securing\r\n     the rear, and making a glorious retreat, was the most celebrated\r\n     piece of conduct. Accordingly such measures were taken to prevent\r\n     surprise in the rear of his arms, that even Pallas herself, in the\r\n     shape of rust, could not invade them. They were drawn into close\r\n     order, firmly embodied, and arrived securely without touch-holes.\r\n     Great and national actions deserve popular applause; and as\r\n     praise is no expense to the public, therefore, dearest kinsman, I\r\n     communicate this to you, as well to oblige this nursery of heroes,\r\n     as to do justice to my native country.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, August 30_, to _Thursday, September 1, 1709_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_White's Chocolate-house, August 31._\r\n\r\nThis place being frequented by persons of condition, I am desired to\r\nrecommend a dog kennel to any who shall want a pack. It lies not far\r\nfrom Suffolk Street,[89] and is kept by two who were formerly dragoons\r\nin the French service; but left plundering for the more orderly life of\r\nkeeping dogs: besides that, according to their expectation, they find\r\nit more profitable, as well as more conducing to the safety of their\r\nskin, to follow this trade, than the beat of drum. Their residence is\r\nvery convenient for the dogs to whelp in, and bring up a right breed to\r\nfollow the scent. The most eminent of the kennel are bloodhounds, which\r\nlead the van, and are as follow:\r\n\r\n\r\n_A List of the Dogs._\r\n\r\nJowler, of a right Irish breed, called Captain.\r\n\r\nRockwood, of French race, with long hair, by the courtesy of England\r\ncalled also Captain.\r\n\r\nPompey, a tall hound, kennelled in a convent in France, and knows a\r\nrich soil.\r\n\r\nThe two last hunt in couple, and are followed by,\r\n\r\nRingwood, a French black whelp of the same breed, a fine open-mouthed\r\ndog; and an old sick hound, always in kennel; but of the true blood,\r\nwith a good nose, French breed.\r\n\r\nThere is also an Italian greyhound, with good legs, and knows perfectly\r\nthe ground from Ghent to Paris.\r\n\r\nTen setting dogs, right English.\r\n\r\nFour mongrels, of the same nation.\r\n\r\nAnd twenty whelps, fit for any game.\r\n\r\nThese curs are so extremely hungry, that they are too keen at the\r\nsport, and worry their game before the keepers can come in. The other\r\nday a wild boar from the north rushed into the kennel, and at first\r\nindeed defended himself against the whole pack; but they proved at\r\nlast too many for him, and tore twenty-five pounds of flesh from off\r\nhis back, with which they filled their bellies, and made so great a\r\nnoise in the neighbourhood, that the keepers are obliged to hasten the\r\nsale. That quarter of the town where they are kennelled is generally\r\ninhabited by strangers, whose blood the hounds have often sucked in\r\nsuch a manner, that many a German count, and other _virtuosi_, who come\r\nfrom the Continent, have lost the intention of their travels, and been\r\nunable to proceed on their journey.\r\n\r\nIf these hounds are not very soon disposed of to some good purchaser,\r\nas also those at the kennels nearer St. James's, it is humbly proposed,\r\nthat they may be altogether transported to America, where the dogs are\r\nfew, and the wild beasts many. Or, that during their stay in these\r\nparts, some eminent justice of the peace may have it in particular\r\ndirection to visit their harbours; and that the Sheriff of Middlesex\r\nmay allow him the assistance of the common hangman to cut off their\r\nears, or part of them, for distinction-sake, that we may know the\r\nbloodhounds from the mongrels and setters. Till these things are\r\nregulated, you may inquire at a house belonging to Paris at the upper\r\nend of Suffolk Street, or a house belonging to Ghent, opposite to the\r\nlower end of Pall Mall, and know further.\r\n\r\nIt were to be wished that these curs were disposed of; for it is a\r\nvery great nuisance to have them tolerated in cities. That of London\r\ntakes care, that the common hunt, assisted by the Sergeants and\r\nbailiffs, expel them wherever they are found within the walls; though\r\nit is said, some private families keep them, to the destruction of\r\ntheir neighbours: but it is desired, that all who know of any of these\r\ncurs, or have been bit by them, would send me their marks, and the\r\nhouses where they are harboured, and I do not doubt but I shall alarm\r\nthe people so well, as to have them used like mad dogs wherever they\r\nappear. In the meantime, I advise all such as entertain this kind\r\nof vermin, that if they give me timely notice that their dogs are\r\ndismissed, I shall let them go unregarded, otherwise am obliged to\r\nadmonish my fellow subjects in this behalf, and instruct them how to\r\navoid being worried, when they are going about their lawful professions\r\nand callings. There was lately a young gentleman bit to the bone; who\r\nhas now indeed recovered his health, but is as lean as a skeleton. It\r\ngrieved my heart to see a gentleman's son run among the hounds; but he\r\nis, they tell me, as fleet and as dangerous as the best of the pack.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will's Coffee-house, August 31._\r\n\r\nThis evening was spent at our table in discourse of propriety of\r\nwords and thoughts, which is Mr. Dryden's definition of wit;[90] but\r\na very odd fellow, who would intrude upon us, and has a briskness of\r\nimagination more like madness than regular thought, said,[91] that\r\nHarry Jacks was the first who told him of the taking of the citadel\r\nof Tournay,[92] \"and,\" says he, \"Harry deserves a statue more than\r\nthe boy who ran to the Senate with a thorn in his foot to tell of a\r\nvictory.\" We were astonished at the assertion, and Spondee asked him,\r\n\"What affinity is there between that boy and Harry, that you say their\r\nmerit resembles so much as you just now told us?\" \"Why,\" says he,\r\n\"Harry you know is in the French interest, and it was more pain to him\r\nto tell the story of Tournay, than to the boy to run upon a thorn to\r\nrelate a victory which he was glad of.\" The gentleman who was in the\r\nchair upon the subject of propriety of words and thoughts, would by no\r\nmeans allow, that there was wit in this comparison; and urged, that to\r\nhave anything gracefully said, it must be natural; and that whatsoever\r\nwas introduced in common discourse with so much premeditation, was\r\ninsufferable. That critic went on: \"Had Mr. Jacks,\" said he, \"told\r\nhim the citadel was taken, and another had answered, 'He deserves a\r\nstatue as well as the Roman boy, for he told it with as much pain';\r\nit might have passed for a sprightly expression: but there is a wit\r\nfor discourse, and a wit for writing. The easiness and familiarity of\r\nthe first, is not to savour in the least of study; but the exactness\r\nof the other, is to admit of something like the freedom of discourse,\r\nespecially in discourses of humanity, and what regards the Belles\r\nLettres. I do not in this allow, that Bickerstaff's _Tatlers_, or\r\ndiscourses of wit by retail, and for the penny, should come within the\r\ndescription of writing.\" I bowed at his compliment, and--but he would\r\nnot let me proceed.\r\n\r\nYou see in no place of conversation the perfection of speech so much\r\nas in an accomplished woman. Whether it be, that there is a partiality\r\nirresistible when we judge of that sex, or whatever it is, you may\r\nobserve a wonderful freedom in their utterance, and an easy flow of\r\nwords, without being distracted (as we often are who read much) in the\r\nchoice of dictions and phrases. My Lady Courtly is an instance of this:\r\nshe was talking the other day of dress, and did it with so excellent an\r\nair and gesture, that you would have sworn she had learned her action\r\nfrom our Demosthenes. Besides which, her words were particularly\r\nwell adapted to the matter she talked of, that the dress was a new\r\nthing to us men. She avoided the terms of art in it, and described an\r\nunaffected garb and manner in so proper terms, that she came up to that\r\nof Horace's \"_simplex munditiis_\";[93] which, whoever can translate in\r\ntwo words, has as much eloquence as Lady Courtly. I took the liberty to\r\ntell her, that all she had said with so much good grace, was spoken in\r\ntwo words in Horace, but would not undertake to translate them; upon\r\nwhich she smiled, and told me, she believed me a very great scholar,\r\nand I took my leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, August 31._\r\n\r\nI have been just now reading the introduction to the History of\r\nCatiline by Sallust, an author who is very much in my favour; but\r\nwhen I reflect upon his professing himself wholly disinterested, and\r\nat the same time see how industriously he has avoided saying anything\r\nto the praise of Cicero, to whose vigilance the commonwealth owed its\r\nsafety, it very much lessens my esteem for that writer; and is one\r\nargument, among others, for laughing at all who pretend to be out of\r\nthe interests of the world, and profess purely to act for the service\r\nof mankind, without the least regard to themselves. I do not deny\r\nbut that the rewards are different; some aim at riches, others at\r\nhonour, by their public services. However, they are all pursuing some\r\nend to themselves, though indeed those ends differ as much as right\r\nand wrong. The most graceful way then, I should think, would be to\r\nacknowledge, that you aim at serving yourselves; but at the same time\r\nmake it appear, it is for the service of others that you have these\r\nopportunities. Of all the disinterested professors I have ever heard\r\nof, I take the boatswain of Dampier's ship to be the most impudent, but\r\nthe most excusable.[94] You are to know, that in the wild searches that\r\nnavigator was making, they happened to be out at sea, far distant from\r\nany shore, in want of all the necessaries of life; insomuch, that they\r\nbegan to look, not without hunger, on each other. The boatswain was a\r\nfat, healthy, fresh fellow, and attracted the eyes of the whole crew.\r\nIn such an extreme necessity, all forms of superiority were laid aside:\r\nthe captain and lieutenant were safe only by being carrion, and the\r\nunhappy boatswain in danger only by being worth eating. To be short,\r\nthe company were unanimous, and the boatswain must be cut up. He saw\r\ntheir intention, and desired he might speak a few words before they\r\nproceeded; which being permitted, he delivered himself as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"GENTLEMEN SAILORS,\r\n\r\n     \"Far be it that I should speak it for any private interest of my\r\n     own, but I take it, that I should not die with a good conscience,\r\n     if I did not confess to you that I am not sound. I say, gentlemen,\r\n     justice, and the testimony of a good conscience, as well as love\r\n     of my country, to which I hope you will all return, oblige me\r\n     to own, that Black Kate at Deptford has made me very unsafe to\r\n     eat; and (I speak it with shame) I am afraid, gentlemen, I should\r\n     poison you.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech had a good effect in the boatswain's favour; but the\r\nsurgeon of the ship protested, he had cured him very well, and offered\r\nto eat the first steak of him himself.\r\n\r\nThe boatswain replied (like an orator, with a true notion of the\r\npeople, and in hopes to gain time) that he was heartily glad if\r\nhe could be for their service, and thanked the surgeon for his\r\ninformation. \"However,\" said he, \"I must inform you, for your own\r\ngood, that I have ever since my cure been very thirsty and dropsical;\r\ntherefore I presume it would be much better to tap me, and drink me\r\noff, than eat me at once, and have no man in the ship fit to be drank.\"\r\nAs he was going on with his harangue, a fresh gale arose, and gave\r\nthe crew hopes of a better repast at the nearest shore, to which they\r\narrived next morning.\r\n\r\nMost of the self-denials we meet with are of this sort; therefore I\r\nthink he acts fairest who owns, he hopes at least to have brother's\r\nfare, without professing that he gives himself up with pleasure to be\r\ndevoured for the preservation of his fellows.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. James's Coffee-house, August 31._\r\n\r\nLetters from the Hague of the 6th of September, N.S., say, that the\r\ngovernor of the citadel at Tournay having offered their highnesses the\r\nDuke of Marlborough and the Prince of Savoy to surrender that place\r\non the 31st of the last month, on terms which were not allowed them\r\nby those princes, hostilities were thereupon renewed; but that on the\r\n3rd the place was surrendered, with a seeming condition granted to the\r\nbesieged above that of being prisoners of war; for they were forthwith\r\nto be conducted to Condé, but were to be exchanged for prisoners of\r\nthe Allies, and particularly those of Warneton were mentioned in the\r\ndemand. Both armies having stretched towards Mons with the utmost\r\ndiligence, that of the Allies, though they passed the much more\r\ndifficult road, arrived first before that town, which they have now\r\nactually invested; and the quartermaster-general was, at the time of\r\ndespatching these letters, marking the ground for the encampment of the\r\ncovering army.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Booksellers, or others whom this Advertisement may concern._\r\n\r\nMr. Omicron,[95] the unborn poet, gives notice, that he writes all\r\ntreatises as well in verse as prose, being a ninth son, and translates\r\nout of all languages, without learning or study.\r\n\r\nIf any bookseller will treat for his pastoral on the \"Siege and\r\nSurrender of the Citadel of Tournay,\" he must send in his proposals\r\nbefore the news of a capitulation for any other town.\r\n\r\nThe undertaker for either play-house may have an opera written by him;\r\nor, if it shall suit their design, a satire upon operas; both ready for\r\nnext winter.\r\n\r\nThis is to give notice, that Richard Farloe, M.A., well known for\r\nhis acuteness in dissection of dead bodies, and his great skill in\r\nosteology, has now laid by that practice; and having, by great study,\r\nand much labour, acquired the knowledge of an antidote for all the most\r\ncommon maladies of the stomach, is removed, and may be applied to, at\r\nany time of the day, in the south entrance from Newgate Street into\r\nChrist's Hospital.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[89] Gambling-houses were very numerous at this time; they were largely\r\nsupported by foreign adventurers, many of whom lived in Suffolk Street,\r\nHaymarket.\r\n\r\n[90] Dryden defines wit as \"a propriety of thoughts and words; or,\r\nin other terms, thoughts and words elegantly adapted to the subject\"\r\n(Preface to \"The State of Innocence\"). Addison observes that this \"is\r\nnot so properly a definition of wit, as of good writing in general\"\r\n(_Spectator_, No. 62).\r\n\r\n[91] \"Told us\" (folio).\r\n\r\n[92] See news paragraph below.\r\n\r\n[93] I Od. v. 5.

This made Captain\r\nSwan say to me, after our arrival at Guam, 'Ah, Dampier, you would have\r\nmade them but a poor meal'; for I was as lean as the captain was lusty\r\nand fleshy.\"\r\n\r\n[95] It has been suggested that there is here a reference to John\r\nOldmixon, the Whig historian and journalist; but in No. 71 Steele seems\r\nto disclaim such an intention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 63. [STEELE, ETC.\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday September 1_, to _Saturday, September 3, 1709_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_White's Chocolate-house, September 2._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Enjoyment of Life with Regard to others._[96]\r\n\r\nI have ever thought it the greatest diminution to the Roman glory\r\nimaginable, that in their institution of public triumphs, they led\r\ntheir enemies in chains when they were prisoners. It is to be allowed,\r\nthat doing all honour to the superiority of heroes above the rest of\r\nmankind, must needs conduce to the glory and advantage of a nation;\r\nbut what shocks the imagination to reflect upon, is, that a polite\r\npeople should think it reasonable, that an unhappy man, who was no way\r\ninferior to the victor, but by the chance of war, should be led like a\r\nslave at the wheels of his chariot. Indeed these other circumstances\r\nof a triumph, that it was not allowed in a civil war, lest part of it\r\nshould be in tears, while the other was making acclamations; that it\r\nshould not be allowed, except such a number were slain in battle; that\r\nthe general should be disgraced who made a false muster of his dead:\r\nthese, I say, had great and politic ends in their being established,\r\nand tended to the apparent benefit of the commonwealth. But this\r\nbehaviour to the conquered had no foundation in nature or policy,\r\nonly to gratify the insolence of a haughty people, who triumphed\r\nover barbarous nations, by acting what was fit only for those very\r\nbarbarians to practise. It seems wonderful, that they who were so\r\nrefined as to take care, that to complete the honour done to the\r\nvictorious officer, no power should be known above him in the Empire\r\non the day of his triumph, but that the consuls themselves should be\r\nbut guests at his table that evening, could not take it into thought\r\nto make the man of chief note among his prisoners one of the company.\r\nThis would have improved the gladness of the occasion, and the victor\r\nhad made a much greater figure, in that no other man appeared unhappy\r\non his day, than in that no other man appeared great. But we will waive\r\nat present such important incidents, and turn our thoughts rather to\r\nthe familiar part of human life, and we shall find, that the great\r\nbusiness we contend for, is in a less degree what those Romans did on\r\nmore solemn occasions, to triumph over our fellow creatures; and there\r\nis hardly a man to be found, who would not rather be in pain to appear\r\nhappy, than be really happy and thought miserable. This men attempt\r\nby sumptuous equipages, splendid houses, numerous servants, and all\r\nthe cares and pursuits of an ambitious or fashionable life. Bromeo\r\nand Tabio are particularly ill-wishers to each other, and rivals in\r\nhappiness. There is no way in nature so good to procure the esteem of\r\nthe one, as to give him little notices of certain secret points wherein\r\nthe other is uneasy. Gnatho has the skill of doing this, and never\r\napplauds the improvements Bromeo has been many years making, and ever\r\nwill be making; but he adds, \"Now this very thing was my thought when\r\nTabio was pulling up his underwood, yet he never would hear of it; but\r\nnow your gardens are in this posture, he is ready to hang himself.\r\nWell, to be sincere, that situation of his can never make an agreeable\r\nseat: he may make his house and appurtenances what he pleases; but he\r\ncannot remove them to the same ground where Bromeo stands. But of all\r\nthings under the sun, a man that is happy at second-hand is the most\r\nmonstrous.\" \"It is a very strange madness,\" answers Bromeo, \"if a\r\nman on these occasions can think of any end but pleasing himself. As\r\nfor my part, if things are convenient, I hate all ostentation: there\r\nis no end of the folly of adapting our affairs to the imagination of\r\nothers.\" Upon which, the next thing he does, is to enlarge whatever he\r\nhears his rival has attempted to imitate him in; but their misfortune\r\nis, that they are in their time of life, in their estates, and in their\r\nunderstandings equal; so that the emulation may continue to the last\r\nday of their lives. As it stands now, Tabio has heard Bromeo has lately\r\npurchased two hundred a year in the annuities since he last settled the\r\naccount of their happiness, in which he thought himself to have the\r\nbalance. This may seem a very fantastical way of thinking in these men;\r\nbut there is nothing so common, as a man's endeavouring rather to go\r\nfarther than some other person towards an easy fortune, than to form\r\nany certain standard that would make himself happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will's Coffee-house, September 2._\r\n\r\nMr. Dactile has been this evening very profuse of his eloquence upon\r\nthe talent of turning things into ridicule; and seemed to say very\r\njustly, that there was generally in it something too disingenuous\r\nfor the society of liberal men, except it were governed by the\r\ncircumstances of persons, time, and place. \"This talent,\" continued\r\nhe, \"is to be used as a man does his sword, not to be drawn but in\r\nhis own defence, or to bring pretenders and impostors in society to\r\na true light.\" But we have seen this faculty so mistaken, that the\r\nburlesque of Virgil himself has passed, among men of little taste, for\r\nwit; and the noblest thoughts that can enter into the heart of man,\r\nlevelled with ribaldry and baseness: though by the rules of justice,\r\nno man ought to be ridiculed for any imperfection, who does not set\r\nup for eminent sufficiency in that way wherein he is defective. Thus\r\ncowards, who would hide themselves by an affected terror in their mien\r\nand dress; and pedants, who would show the depth of their knowledge\r\nby a supercilious gravity, are equally the objects of laughter. Not\r\nthat they are in themselves ridiculous for their want of courage, or\r\nweakness of understanding, but that they seem insensible of their\r\nown place in life, and unhappily rank themselves with those, whose\r\nabilities, compared to their defects, make them contemptible. At the\r\nsame time, it must be remarked, that risibility being the effect of\r\nreason, a man ought to be expelled from sober company who laughs\r\nwithout it. \"Ha! ha!\" says Will. Truby, who sat by, \"will any man\r\npretend to give me laws when I should laugh, or tell me what I should\r\nlaugh at?\" \"Look ye,\" answered Humphrey Slyboots, \"you are mightily\r\nmistaken; you may, if you please, make what noise you will, and nobody\r\ncan hinder an English gentleman from putting his face into what posture\r\nhe thinks fit; but, take my word for it, that motion which you now\r\nmake with your mouth open, and the agitation of your stomach, which\r\nyou relieve by holding your sides, is not laughter: laughter is a more\r\nweighty thing than you imagine; and I'll tell you a secret, you never\r\ndid laugh in your life; and truly I am afraid you never will, except\r\nyou take great care to be cured of those convulsive fits.\" Truby left\r\nus, and when he had got two yards from us, \"Well,\" said he, \"you are\r\nstrange fellows,\" and was immediately taken with another fit.\r\n\r\nThe Trubies are a well-natured family, whose particular make is such,\r\nthat they have the same pleasure out of good Will, which other people\r\nhave in that scorn which is the cause of laughter: therefore their\r\nbursting into the figures of men when laughing, proceeds only from a\r\ngeneral benevolence they are born with; as the Slyboots smile only on\r\nthe greatest occasion of mirth; which difference is caused rather from\r\na different structure of their organs, than that one is less moved than\r\nthe other. I know Sowerly frets inwardly when Will. Truby laughs at\r\nhim; but when I meet him, and he bursts out, I know it is out of his\r\nabundant joy to see me, which he expresses by that vociferation which\r\nis in others laughter. But I shall defer considering this subject at\r\nlarge, till I come to my treatise of oscitation, laughter, and ridicule.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, September 2._\r\n\r\nThe following letter being a panegyric upon me for a quality which\r\nevery man may attain, an acknowledgment of his faults; I thought it for\r\nthe good of my fellow writers to publish it.[97]\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"It must be allowed, that Esquire Bickerstaff is of all authors\r\n     the most ingenuous. There are few, very few, that will own\r\n     themselves in a mistake, though all the world see them to be\r\n     in downright nonsense. You'll be pleased, sir, to pardon this\r\n     expression, for the same reason for which you once desired us to\r\n     excuse you when you seemed anything dull. Most writers, like the\r\n     generality of Paul Lorrain's Saints,[98] seem to place a peculiar\r\n     vanity in dying hard. But you, sir, to show a good example to\r\n     your brethren, have not only confessed, but of your own accord\r\n     mended the indictment. Nay, you have been so good-natured as to\r\n     discover beauties in it, which, I'll assure you, he that drew it\r\n     never dreamed of: and to make your civility the more accomplished,\r\n     you have honoured him with the title of your kinsman, which,\r\n     though derived by the left hand, he is not a little proud of. My\r\n     brother (for such Obadiah is) being at present very busy about\r\n     nothing, has ordered me to return you his sincere thanks for\r\n     all these favours; and, as a small token of his gratitude to\r\n     communicate to you the following piece of intelligence, which,\r\n     he thinks, belongs more properly to you than to any other of\r\n     our modern historians. Madonella,[99] who as it was thought had\r\n     long since taken her flight towards the ethereal mansions, still\r\n     walks, it seems, in the regions of mortality; where she has\r\n     found, by deep reflections on the revolution mentioned in yours\r\n     of June 23rd, that where early instructions have been wanting\r\n     to imprint true ideas of things on the tender souls of those of\r\n     her sex, they are never after able to arrive at such a pitch of\r\n     perfection, as to be above the laws of matter and motion; laws\r\n     which are considerably enforced by the principles usually imbibed\r\n     in nurseries and boarding-schools. To remedy this evil, she has\r\n     laid the scheme of a college for young damsels; where, instead\r\n     of scissors, needles, and sampler; pens, compasses, quadrants,\r\n     books, manuscripts, Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, are to take up their\r\n     whole time. Only on holidays the students will, for moderate\r\n     exercise, be allowed to divert themselves with the use of some of\r\n     the lightest and most voluble weapons; and proper care will be\r\n     taken to give them at least a superficial tincture of the ancient\r\n     and modern Amazonian tactics. Of these military performances, the\r\n     direction is undertaken by Epicene,[100] the writer of Memoirs\r\n     from the Mediterranean, who, by the help of some artificial\r\n     poisons conveyed by smells, has within these few weeks brought\r\n     many persons of both sexes to an untimely fate; and, what is more\r\n     surprising, has, contrary to her profession, with the same odours,\r\n     revived others who had long since been drowned in the whirlpools\r\n     of Lethe. Another of the professors is to be a certain lady,[101]\r\n     who is now publishing two of the choicest Saxon novels, which are\r\n     said to have been in as great repute with the ladies of Queen\r\n     Emma's Court, as the Memoirs from the new Atalantis are with those\r\n     of ours. I shall make it my business to inquire into the progress\r\n     of this learned institution, and give you the first notice of\r\n     their philosophical transactions, and searches after nature.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours, &c.,\r\n  TOBIAH GREENHAT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. James's Coffee-house, September 2._\r\n\r\nThis day we have received advices by the way of Ostend, which give an\r\naccount of an engagement between the French and the Allies on the 11th\r\ninstant, N.S.[102] Marshal Boufflers arrived in the enemy's camp on\r\nthe 5th, and acquainted Marshal Villars, that he did not come in any\r\ncharacter, but to receive his commands for the king's service, and\r\ncommunicate to him his orders upon the present posture of affairs.\r\nOn the 9th, both armies advanced towards each other, and cannonaded\r\nall the ensuing day till the close of the evening, and stood on their\r\narms all that night. On the day of battle, the cannonading was renewed\r\nabout seven: the Duke of Argyle had orders to attack the wood Saar on\r\nthe right, which he executed so successfully, that he pierced through\r\nit, and won a considerable post. The Prince of Orange had the same\r\ngood fortune in a wood on the left: after which, the whole body of\r\nthe confederates, joined by the forces from the siege, marched up,\r\nand engaged the enemy, who were drawn up at some distance from these\r\nwoods. The dispute was very warm for some time; but towards noon the\r\nFrench began to give ground from one wing to the other: which advantage\r\nbeing observed by our generals, the whole army was urged on with fresh\r\nvigour, and in a few hours the day ended with the entire defeat of the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[96] Probably this article is by Addison; see note to No. 50.\r\n\r\n[97] Nichols suggested that this letter was by Swift, and it is printed\r\nin Scott's edition of his works.\r\n\r\n[98] Paul Lorrain (died 1719) was the Ordinary of Newgate.

I Od. ii. 36.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, September 5._\r\n\r\nWhen I lately spoke of triumphs, and the behaviour of the Romans on\r\nthose occasions,[103] I knew by my skill in astrology, that there was a\r\ngreat event approaching to our advantage; but not having yet taken upon\r\nme to tell fortunes, I thought fit to defer the mention of the battle\r\nof Mons[104] till it happened; which moderation was no final pain to\r\nme: but I should wrong my art, if I concealed that some of my aërial\r\nintelligencers had signified to me the news of it even from Paris,\r\nbefore the arrival of Lieutenant-Colonel Graham[105] in England. All\r\nnations, as well as persons, have their good and evil genius attending\r\nthem; but the kingdom of France has three, the last of which is neither\r\nfor it nor against it in reality, but has for some months past acted\r\nan ambiguous part, and attempted to save its ward from the incursion\r\nof its powerful enemies, by little subterfuges and tricks, which a\r\nnation is more than undone when it is reduced to practise. Thus,\r\ninstead of giving exact accounts and representations of things, they\r\ntell what is indeed true, but at the same time a falsehood when all the\r\ncircumstances come to be related.\r\n\r\nPacolet was at the Court of France on Friday night last, when this\r\ngenius of that kingdom came thither in the shape of a post-boy, and\r\ncried out, that Mons was relieved, and the Duke of Marlborough marched.\r\nPacolet was much astonished at this account, and immediately changed\r\nhis form, and flew to the neighbourhood of Mons, from whence he found\r\nthe Allies had really marched, and began to inquire into the reasons of\r\nthis sudden change, and half feared he had heard a truth of the posture\r\nof the French affairs, even in their own country. But upon diligent\r\ninquiry among the aërials who attend these regions, and consultation\r\nwith the neighbouring peasants, he was able to bring me the following\r\naccount of the motions of the armies since they retired from about that\r\nplace, and the action which followed thereupon.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday the 7th of September, N.S., the confederate army was\r\nalarmed in their camp at Havre by intelligence, that the enemy were\r\nmarching to attack the Prince of Hesse. Upon this advice, the Duke of\r\nMarlborough commanded that the troops should immediately move, which\r\nwas accordingly performed, and they were all joined on Sunday the 8th\r\nat noon. On that day in the morning it appeared, that instead of being\r\nattacked, the advanced guard of the detachment commanded by the Prince\r\nof Hesse had dispersed and taken prisoners a party of the enemy's\r\nhorse, which was sent out to observe the march of the confederates.\r\nThe French moved from Quiverain on Sunday in the morning, and inclined\r\nto the right from thence all that day. The 9th, the Monday following,\r\nthey continued their march till on Tuesday the 10th they possessed\r\nthemselves of the woods of Dour and Blaugies. As soon as they came\r\ninto that ground, they threw up entrenchments with all expedition.\r\nThe Allies arrived within few hours after the enemy was posted; but\r\nthe Duke of Marlborough thought fit to wait for the arrival of the\r\nreinforcement which he expected from the siege of Tournay. Upon notice\r\nthat these troops were so far advanced as to be depended on for an\r\naction the next day, it was accordingly resolved to engage the enemy.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary for understanding the greatness of the action,\r\nand the several motions made in the time of the engagement, that you\r\nhave in your mind an idea of the place. The two armies on the 11th\r\ninstant were both drawn up before the woods of Dour, Blaugies, Sart and\r\nJansart; the army of the Prince of Savoy on the right before that of\r\nBlaugies; the forces of Great Britain in the centre on his left; those\r\nof the High Allies, with the wood Sart, as well as a large interval\r\nof plain ground, and Jansart, on the left of the whole. The enemy\r\nwere entrenched in the paths of the woods, and drawn up behind two\r\nentrenchments over against them, opposite to the armies of the Duke of\r\nMarlborough and Prince Eugene. There were also two lines entrenched in\r\nthe plains over against the army of the States. This was the posture\r\nof the French and confederate forces when the signal was given, and\r\nthe whole line moved on to the charge. The Dutch army, commanded by\r\nthe Prince of Hesse, attacked with the most undaunted bravery; and\r\nafter a very obstinate resistance, forced the first entrenchment of\r\nthe enemy in the plain between Sart and Jansart; but were repulsed in\r\ntheir attack on the second with great slaughter on both sides. The Duke\r\nof Marlborough, while this was transacting on the left, had with very\r\nmuch difficulty marched through Sart, and beaten the enemy from the\r\nseveral entrenchments they had thrown up in it. As soon as the Duke had\r\nmarched into the plain, he observed the main body of the enemy drawn\r\nup and entrenched in the front of his army. This situation of the\r\nenemy, in the ordinary course of war, is usually thought an advantage\r\nhardly to be surmounted; and might appear impracticable to any but that\r\narmy which had just overcome greater difficulties. The Duke commanded\r\nthe troops to form, but to forbear charging till further order. In\r\nthe meantime he visited the left of our line, where the troops of the\r\nStates had been engaged. The slaughter on this side had been very\r\ngreat, and the Dutch incapable of making further progress, except\r\nthey were suddenly reinforced. The right of our line was attacked\r\nsoon after their coming upon the plain; but they drove back the enemy\r\nwith such bravery, that the victory began to incline to the Allies\r\nby the precipitate retreat of the French to their works, from whence\r\nthey were immediately beaten. The Duke upon observing this advantage\r\non the right, commanded the Earl of Orkney to march with a sufficient\r\nnumber of battalions to force the enemy from their entrenchments on the\r\nplain between the woods of Sart and Jansart; which being performed,\r\nthe horse of the Allies marched into the plains, covered by their own\r\nfoot, and forming themselves in good order, the cavalry of the enemy\r\nattempted no more, but to cover the foot in their retreat. The Allies\r\nmade so good use of the beginning of the victory, that all their troops\r\nmoved on with fresh resolution, till they saw the enemy fly before\r\nthem towards Condé and Maubeuge; after whom proper detachments were\r\nmade, who made a terrible slaughter in the pursuit. In this action it\r\nis said Prince Eugene was wounded, as also the Duke of Aremberg, and\r\nLieutenant-General Webb. The Count of Oxenstern, Colonel Lalo, and Sir\r\nThomas Pendergrass, killed. This wonderful success, obtained under all\r\nthe difficulties that could be opposed in the way of an army, must be\r\nacknowledged as owing to the genius, courage and conduct of the Duke of\r\nMarlborough, a consummate hero; who has lived not only beyond the time\r\nin which Cæsar said, he was arrived at a satiety of life and glory; but\r\nalso been so long the subject of panegyric, that it is as hard to say\r\nanything new in his praise, as to add to the merit which requires such\r\neulogiums.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will's Coffee-house, September 5._\r\n\r\nThe following letter[106] being very explanatory of the true design\r\nof our Lucubrations, and at the same time an excellent model for\r\nperforming it, it is absolutely necessary, for the better understanding\r\nour works, to publish it.\r\n\r\n  \"_To Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq._\r\n\r\n  \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"Though I have not the honour to be of the family of the Staffs,\r\n     nor related to any branch of it, yet I applaud your wholesome\r\n     project of making wit useful.\r\n\r\n     \"This is what has been, or should have been, intended by the\r\n     best comedies.

I. 85, 86.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will's Coffee-house, September 7._\r\n\r\nI came hither this evening, and expected nothing else but mutual\r\ncongratulations in the company on the late victory; but found our\r\nroom, which one would have hoped to have seen full of good humour and\r\nalacrity upon so glorious an occasion, full of sour animals, inquiring\r\ninto the action, in doubt of what had happened, and fearful of the\r\nsuccess of their countrymen. It is natural to believe easily what we\r\nwish heartily; and a certain rule, that they are not friends to a glad\r\noccasion, who speak all they can against the truth of it; who end their\r\nargument against our happiness, that they wish it otherwise. When I\r\ncame into the room, a gentleman was declaiming; \"If,\" says he, \"we\r\nhave so great and complete a victory, why have we not the names of the\r\nprisoners? Why is not an exact relation of the conduct of our generals\r\nlaid before the world? Why do we not know where or whom to applaud?\r\nIf we are victorious, why do we not give an account of our captives\r\nand our slain? But we are to be satisfied with general notices we are\r\nconquerors, and to believe it so. Sure this is approving the despotic\r\nway of treating the world, which we pretend to fight against, if we\r\nsit down satisfied with such contradictory accounts, which have the\r\nwords of triumph, but do not bear the spirit of it.\" I whispered Mr.\r\nGreenhat Pray what can that dissatisfied man be?\" \"He is,\" answered\r\nhe, \"a character you have not yet perhaps observed. You have heard\r\nof battle-painters, have mentioned a battle-poet; but this is a\r\nbattle-critic. He is a fellow that lives in a government so gentle,\r\nthat though it sees him an enemy, suffers his malice because they know\r\nhis impotence. He is to examine the weight of an advantage before the\r\ncompany will allow it.\" Greenhat was going on in his explanation,\r\nwhen Sir George England thought fit to take up the discourse in the\r\nfollowing manner:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, the action you are in so great doubt to approve of, is\r\ngreater than ever has been performed in any age; and the value of it\r\nI observe from your dissatisfaction: for battle-critics are like all\r\nothers; you are the more offended, the more you ought to be, and are\r\nconvinced you ought to be, pleased. Had this engagement happened in the\r\ntime of the old Romans, and such things been acted in their service,\r\nthere would not be a foot of the wood which was pierced but had been\r\nconsecrated to some deity, or made memorable by the death of him who\r\nexpired in it for the sake of his country. It had on some monument\r\nat the entrance been said, 'Here the Duke of Argyle drew his sword,\r\nand said, March. Here Webb, after having an accomplished fame for\r\ngallantry, exposed himself like a common soldier. Here Rivet, who was\r\nwounded at the beginning of the day, and carried off as dead, returned\r\nto the field, and received his death.'[108] Medals had been struck\r\nfor our general's behaviour when he first came into the plain. Here\r\nwas the fury of the action, and here the hero stood as fearless as if\r\ninvulnerable. Such certainly had been the cares of that state for their\r\nown honour, and in gratitude to their heroic subjects. But the wood\r\nentrenched, the plain made more impassable than the wood, and all the\r\ndifficulties opposed to the most gallant army and most intrepid leaders\r\nthat ever the sun shone upon, are treated by the talk of some in this\r\nroom as objections to the merit of our general and our army; but,\"\r\ncontinued he, \"I leave all the examination of this matter, and a proper\r\ndiscourse on our sense of public actions, to my friend Mr. Bickerstaff,\r\nwho may let beaus and gamesters rest, till he has examined into the\r\nreasons of men's being malcontents in the only nation that suffers\r\nprofessed enemies to breathe in open air.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Sept. 7._\r\n\r\nThe following letters are sent to me from relations; and though I do\r\nnot know who and who are intended, I publish them. I have only written\r\nnonsense if there is nothing in them; and done a good action if they\r\nalarm any heedless men against the fraternity of the knights whom the\r\nGreeks call #Raskals#.[109]\r\n\r\n     \"MR. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n     \"It is taken very ill by several gentlemen here, that you are\r\n     so little vigilant as to let the dogs run from their kennels to\r\n     this place. Had you done your duty, we should have had notice\r\n     of their arrival; but the sharpers are now become so formidable\r\n     here, that they have divided themselves into nobles and commons.\r\n     Beau Bogg, beau Pert, Rake, and Tallboy are of their upper\r\n     house; broken captains, ignorant attorneys, and such other\r\n     bankrupts from industrious professions, compose their lower\r\n     order. Among these two sets of men, there happened here lately\r\n     some unhappy differences: Squire Humphry came down among us with\r\n     four hundred guineas. His raw appearance, and certain signals in\r\n     the good-natured muscles of Humphry's countenance, alarmed the\r\n     societies. For sharpers are as skilful as beggars in physiognomy,\r\n     and know as well where to hope for plunder, as the others to ask\r\n     for alms. Pert was the man exactly fitted for taking with Humphry\r\n     as a fine gentleman; for a raw fool is ever enamoured with his\r\n     contrary, a coxcomb; and a coxcomb is what the booby, who wants\r\n     experience, and is unused to company, regards as the first of men.\r\n     He ever looks at him with envy, and would certainly be such, if he\r\n     were not oppressed by his rusticity or bashfulness. There arose\r\n     an entire friendship by this sympathy between Pert and Humphry,\r\n     which ended in stripping the latter. We now could see this forlorn\r\n     youth for some days moneyless, without sword, and one day without\r\n     his hat, and with secret melancholy pining for his snuff-box; the\r\n     jest of the whole town, but most of those who robbed him. At last\r\n     fresh bills came down, when immediately their countenances cleared\r\n     up, ancient kindnesses and familiarity renewed, and to dinner he\r\n     was invited by the fraternity. You are to know, that while he was\r\n     in his days of solitude, a commoner who was excluded from his\r\n     share of the prey, had whispered the squire, that he was bit, and\r\n     cautioned him of venturing again. However, hopes of recovering his\r\n     snuff-box, which was given him by his aunt, made him fall to play\r\n     after dinner; yet mindful of what he was told, he saw something\r\n     that provoked him to tell them they were a company of sharpers.\r\n     Presently Tallboy fell on him, and being too hard at fisticuffs,\r\n     drove him out of doors. The valiant Pert followed, and kicked\r\n     him in his turn; which the squire resented, as being nearer his\r\n     match; so challenged him: but differing about time and place,\r\n     friends interposed (for he had still money left) and persuaded him\r\n     to ask pardon for provoking them to beat him, and they asked his\r\n     for doing it. The house consulting whence Humphry could have his\r\n     information, concluded it must be from some malicious commoner;\r\n     and to be revenged, beau Bogg watched their haunts, and in a\r\n     shop where some of them were at play with ladies, showed dice\r\n     which he found, or pretended to find upon them; and declaring how\r\n     false they were, warned the company to take care who they played\r\n     with. By his seeming candour, he cleared his reputation at least\r\n     to fools, and some silly women; but it was still blasted by the\r\n     squire's story with thinking men: however, he gained a great point\r\n     by it; for the next day he got the company shut up with himself\r\n     and fellow-members, and robbed them at discretion.\r\n\r\n     \"I cannot express to you with what indignation I behold the noble\r\n     spirit of gentlemen degenerated to that of private cut-purses.\r\n     'Tis in vain to hope a remedy while so many of the fraternity get\r\n     and enjoy estates of twenty, thirty, and fifty thousand pounds\r\n     with impunity, creep into the best conversations, and spread the\r\n     infectious villainy through the nation, while the lesser rogues,\r\n     that rob for hunger or nakedness, are sacrificed by the blind, and\r\n     in this respect partial and defective law.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, Sept. 8_, to _Saturday, Sept. 10, 1709_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will's Coffee-house, Sept. 9._[113]\r\n\r\nThe subject of the discourse this evening was Eloquence and Graceful\r\nAction. Lysander, who is something particular in his way of thinking\r\nand speaking, told us, a man could not be eloquent without action: for\r\nthe deportment of the body, the turn of the eye, and an apt sound to\r\nevery word that is uttered, must all conspire to make an accomplished\r\nspeaker. Action in one that speaks in public, is the same thing as a\r\ngood mien in ordinary life. Thus, as a certain insensibility in the\r\ncountenance recommends a sentence of humour and jest, so it must be a\r\nvery lively consciousness that gives grace to great sentiments. The\r\njest is to be a thing unexpected; therefore your undesigning manner\r\nis a beauty in expressions of mirth; but when you are to talk on a\r\nset subject, the more you are moved yourself, the more you will move\r\nothers. \"There is,\" said he, \"a remarkable example of that kind:\r\nÆschines, a famous orator of antiquity, had pleaded at Athens in\r\na great cause against Demosthenes; but having lost it, retired to\r\nRhodes. Eloquence was then the quality most admired among men; and the\r\nmagistrates of that place having heard he had a copy of the speech of\r\nDemosthenes, desired him to repeat both their pleadings. After his own,\r\nhe recited also the oration of his antagonist. The people expressed\r\ntheir admiration of both, but more of that of Demosthenes. 'If you\r\nare,' said he, 'thus touched with hearing only what that great orator\r\nsaid, how would you have been affected had you seen him speak? For he\r\nwho hears Demosthenes only, loses much the better part of the oration.'\r\nCertain it is, that they who speak gracefully, are very lamely\r\nrepresented in having their speeches read or repeated by unskilful\r\npeople; for there is something native to each man, so inherent to his\r\nthoughts and sentiments, which it is hardly possible for another to\r\ngive a true idea of. You may observe in common talk, when a sentence\r\nof any man's is repeated, an acquaintance of his shall immediately\r\nobserve, 'That is so like him, methinks I see how he looked when he\r\nsaid it.' But of all the people on the earth, there are none who puzzle\r\nme so much as the clergy of Great Britain, who are, I believe, the most\r\nlearned body of men now in the world; and yet this art of speaking,\r\nwith the proper ornaments of voice and gesture, is wholly neglected\r\namong them; and I'll engage, were a deaf man to behold the greater part\r\nof them preach, he would rather think they were reading the contents\r\nonly of some discourse they intended to make, than actually in the\r\nbody of an oration, even when they are upon matters of such a nature\r\nas one would believe it were impossible to think of without emotion.\r\nI own there are exceptions to this general observation, and that the\r\nDean[114] we heard the other day together, is an orator. He has so\r\nmuch regard to his congregation, that he commits to his memory what\r\nhe is to say to them; and has so soft and graceful a behaviour, that\r\nit must attract your attention. His person, it is to be confessed,\r\nis no small recommendation; but he is to be highly commended for not\r\nlosing that advantage, and adding to the propriety of speech (which\r\nmight pass the criticism of Longinus) an action which would have been\r\napproved by Demosthenes. He has a peculiar force in his way, and has\r\nmany of his audience[115] who could not be intelligent hearers of his\r\ndiscourse, were there not explanation as well as grace in his action.\r\nThis art of his is used with the most exact and honest skill. He\r\nnever attempts your passions till he has convinced your reason. All\r\nthe objections which he can form are laid open and dispersed, before\r\nhe uses the least vehemence in his sermon; but when he thinks he has\r\nyour head, he very soon wins your heart; and never pretends to show\r\nthe beauty of holiness till he hath convinced you of the truth of it.\r\nWould every one of our clergymen be thus careful to recommend truth\r\nand virtue in their proper figures, and show so much concern for them\r\nas to give them all the additional force they were able, it is not\r\npossible that nonsense should have so many hearers as you find it has\r\nin dissenting congregations, for no reason in the world but because it\r\nis spoken extempore; for ordinary minds are wholly governed by their\r\neyes and ears, and there is no way to come at their hearts but by\r\npower over their imaginations. There is my friend and merry companion\r\nDaniel:[116] he knows a great deal better than he speaks, and can form\r\na proper discourse as well as any orthodox neighbour. But he knows very\r\nwell, that to bawl out, My beloved! and the words, Grace! Regeneration!\r\nSanctification! A new light! The day! the day! ay, my beloved, the day!\r\nor rather, the night! the night is coming! and judgment will come, when\r\nwe least think of it! and so forth--he knows to be vehement is the only\r\nway to come at his audience. Daniel, when he sees my friend Greenhat\r\ncome in, can give him a good hint, and cry out, This is only for the\r\nsaints! the regenerated! By this force of action, though mixed with\r\nall the incoherence and ribaldry imaginable, Daniel can laugh at his\r\ndiocesan, and grow fat by voluntary subscription, while the parson of\r\nthe parish goes to law for half his dues. Daniel will tell you, it is\r\nnot the shepherd, but the sheep with the bell, which the flock follows.\r\nAnother thing very wonderful this learned body should omit, is,\r\nlearning to read; which is a most necessary part of eloquence in one\r\nwho is to serve at the altar: for there is no man but must be sensible,\r\nthat the lazy tone and inarticulate sound of our common readers,\r\ndepreciates the most proper form of words that were ever extant in any\r\nnation or language, to speak our own wants, or His power from whom we\r\nask relief. There cannot be a greater instance of the power of action\r\nthan in little Parson Dapper,[117] who is the common relief to all the\r\nlazy pulpits in town. This smart youth has a very good memory, a quick\r\neye, and a clean handkerchief. Thus equipped, he opens his text, shuts\r\nhis book fairly, shows he has no notes in his Bible, opens both palms,\r\nand shows all is fair there too. Thus, with a decisive air, my young\r\nman goes on without hesitation; and though, from the beginning to the\r\nend of his pretty discourse, he has not used one proper gesture, yet at\r\nthe conclusion the church-warden pulls his gloves from off his head;\r\n'Pray, who is this extraordinary young man?' Thus the force of action\r\nis such, that it is more prevalent, even when improper, than all the\r\nreason and argument in the world without it.\" This gentleman concluded\r\nhis discourse by saying, \"I do not doubt but if our preachers would\r\nlearn to speak, and our readers to read, within six months' time we\r\nshould not have a dissenter within a mile of a church in Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Sept. 9._\r\n\r\nI have a letter from a young fellow who complains to me, that he was\r\nbred a mercer, and is now just out of his time, but unfortunately (for\r\nhe has no manner of education suitable to his present estate) an uncle\r\nhas left him £1000 per annum.\r\n\r\nThe young man is sensible that he is so spruce, that he fears he shall\r\nnever be genteel as long as he lives, but applies himself to me, to\r\nknow what method to take to help his air and be a fine gentleman. He\r\nadds, that several of those ladies who were formerly his customers,\r\nvisit his mother on purpose to fall in his way, and fears he shall\r\nbe obliged to marry against his will; \"for,\" says he, \"if any one of\r\nthem should ask me, I shall not be able to deny her. I am,\" says he\r\nfurther, \"utterly at a loss how to deal with them; for though I was\r\nthe most pert creature in the world when I was foreman, and could\r\nhand a woman of the first quality to her coach, as well as her own\r\ngentleman-usher, I am now quite out of my way, and speechless in their\r\ncompany. They commend my modesty to my face. No one scruples to say, I\r\nshould certainly make the best husband in the world, a man of my sober\r\neducation. Mrs. Would-be watches all opportunities to be alone with me.\r\nTherefore, good Mr. Bickerstaff, here are my writings enclosed; if you\r\ncan find any flaw in my title, so as it may go to the next heir, who\r\ngoes to St. James's Coffee-house, and White's, and could enjoy it, I\r\nshould be extremely well pleased with two thousand pounds to set up my\r\ntrade, and live in a way I know I should become, rather than be laughed\r\nat all my life among too good company. If you could send for my cousin,\r\nand persuade him to take the estate on these terms, and let nobody know\r\nit, you would extremely oblige me.\"\r\n\r\nUpon first sight, I thought this a very whimsical proposal; however,\r\nupon more mature consideration, I could not but admire the young\r\ngentleman's prudence and good sense; for there is nothing so irksome\r\nas living in a way a man knows he does not become. I consulted Mr.\r\nObadiah Greenhat on this occasion, and he is so well pleased with\r\nthe man, that he has half a mind to take the estate himself; but\r\nupon second thoughts he proposed this expedient. \"I should be very\r\nwilling,\" said he, \"to keep the estate where it is, if we could make\r\nthe young man any way easy; therefore I humbly propose he should take\r\nto drinking for one half-year, and make a sloven of him, and from\r\nthence begin his education anew: for it is a maxim, that one who is\r\nill taught is in a worse condition than he who is wholly ignorant;\r\ntherefore a spruce mercer is further off the air of a fine gentleman\r\nthan a downright clown. To make our patient anything better, we must\r\nunmake him what he is.\" I indeed proposed to flux him; but Greenhat\r\nanswered, that if he recovered, he would be as prim and feat as ever\r\nhe was: therefore he would have it his way; and our friend is to drink\r\ntill he is carbuncled, and tun-bellied; after which we will send him\r\ndown to smoke, and be buried with his ancestors in Derbyshire. I am\r\nindeed desirous he should have his life in the estate, because he\r\nhas such a just sense of himself and his abilities, to know that it\r\nis an unhappiness to him to be a man of fortune. This youth seems\r\nto understand, that a gentleman's life is that of all others the\r\nhardest to pass through with propriety of behaviour; for though he\r\nhas a support without art or labour, yet his manner of enjoying that\r\ncircumstance is a thing to be considered; and you see among men\r\nwho are honoured with the common appellation of gentlemen, so many\r\ncontradictions to that character, that it is the utmost ill-fortune to\r\nbear it: for which reason I am obliged to change the circumstances of\r\nseveral about this town. Harry Lacker is so very exact in his dress,\r\nthat I shall give his estate to his younger brother, and make him a\r\ndancing master. Nokes Lightfoot is so nimble, and values himself so\r\nmuch upon it, that I have thoughts of making him huntsman to a pack of\r\nbeagles, and give his land to somebody that will stay upon it.\r\n\r\nNow I am upon the topic of becoming what we enjoy, I forbid all persons\r\nwho are not of the first quality, or who do not bear some important\r\noffice that requires so much distinction, to go to Hyde Park with six\r\nhorses, for I cannot but esteem it the highest insolence: therefore\r\nhereafter no man shall do it merely because he is able, without any\r\nother pretension. But what may serve all purposes quite as well, it\r\nshall be allowed all such who think riches the chief distinction, to\r\nappear in the Ring[118] with two horses only, and a rent-roll hanging\r\nout of each side of their coach. This is a thought of Mr. Greenhat's,\r\nwho designs very soon to publish a sumptuary discourse upon the subject\r\nof equipage, wherein he will give us rules on that subject, and assign\r\nthe proper duties and qualifications of masters and servants, as well\r\nas that of husbands and wives; with a treatise of economy without\r\ndoors, or the complete art of appearing in the world. This will be very\r\nuseful to all who are suddenly rich, or are ashamed of being poor.\r\n\r\n    ----_Sunt certa piacula, quæ te\r\n    Ter pure lecto poterunt recreare libello._[119]\r\n\r\nI have notice of a new pack of dogs, of quite another sort than\r\nhitherto mentioned. I have not an exact account of their way of\r\nhunting, the following letter giving only a bare notice of them.\r\n\r\n  \"SIR,\r\n\r\n  _September 7._\r\n\r\n     \"There are another pack of dogs to be disposed of, who kennel\r\n     about Charing Cross, at the old Fat Dog's at the corner of\r\n     Buckingham Court,[120] near Spring Garden:[121] two of them are\r\n     said to be whelped in Alsatia,[122] now in ruins; but they, with\r\n     the rest of the pack, are as pernicious as if the old kennel had\r\n     never been broken down. The ancients distinguished this sort of\r\n     curs by the name of Hæredipetes,[123] the most pernicious of all\r\n     biters, for seizing young heirs, especially when their estates are\r\n     entailed, whom they reduce by one good bite to such a condition,\r\n     that they cannot ever after come to the use of their teeth, or\r\n     get smelling of a crust. You are desired to dispose of these as\r\n     soon as you can, that the breed may not increase; and your care in\r\n     tying them up will be acknowledged by,\r\n\r\n  \"SIR,\r\n  Humble Servant,\r\n  PHILANTHROPOS.\"[124]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. James's Coffee-house, Sept. 9._\r\n\r\nWe have received letters from the Duke of Marlborough's camp, which\r\nbring us further particulars of the great and glorious victory obtained\r\nover the enemy on the 11th instant, N.S. The number of the wounded and\r\nprisoners is much greater than was expected from our first account.\r\nThe day was doubtful till after twelve o'clock; but the enemy made\r\nlittle resistance after their first line on the left began to give\r\nway. An exact narration of the whole affair is expected next post. The\r\nFrench have had two days allowed them to bury their dead, and carry off\r\ntheir wounded men upon parole. Those regiments of Great Britain which\r\nsuffered most, are ordered into garrison, and fresh troops commanded to\r\nmarch into the field. The States have also directed troops to march out\r\nof the towns, to relieve those who lost so many men in attacking the\r\nsecond entrenchment of the French in the plain between Sart and Jansart.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[112] Probably Heidegger.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, Sept. 10, to Tuesday, Sept. 13, 1709_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Sept. 12._\r\n\r\nNo man can conceive, till he comes to try it, how great a pain it is\r\nto be a public-spirited person. I am sure I am unable to express to\r\nthe world, how much anxiety I have suffered, to see of how little\r\nbenefit my lucubrations have been to my fellow-subjects. Men will go\r\non in their own way in spite of all my labour. I gave Mr. Didapper\r\na private reprimand for wearing red-heeled shoes, and at the same\r\ntime was so indulgent as to connive at him for fourteen days, because\r\nI would give him the wearing of them out; but after all this, I am\r\ninformed, he appeared yesterday with a new pair of the same sort. I\r\nhave no better success with Mr. Whatdee'call,[125] as to his buttons:\r\nStentor[126] still roars; and box and dice rattle as loud as they did\r\nbefore I writ against them. Partridge[127] walks about at noonday, and\r\nÆsculapius[128] thinks of adding a new lace to his livery. However, I\r\nmust still go on in laying these enormities before men's eyes, and let\r\nthem answer for going on in their practice.\r\n\r\nMy province[129] is much larger than at first sight men would imagine,\r\nand I shall lose no part of my jurisdiction, which extends not only to\r\nfuturity, but also is retrospect to things past; and the behaviour of\r\npersons who have long ago acted their parts, is as much liable to my\r\nexamination as that of my own contemporaries.\r\n\r\nIn order to put the whole race of mankind in their proper distinctions,\r\naccording to the opinion their cohabitants conceived of them, I have,\r\nwith very much care, and depth of meditation, thought fit to erect\r\na Chamber of Fame, and established certain rules, which are to be\r\nobserved in admitting members into this illustrious society.\r\n\r\nIn this Chamber of Fame there are to be three tables, but of different\r\nlengths: the first is to contain exactly twelve persons; the second,\r\ntwenty; the third, an hundred. This is reckoned to be the full number\r\nof those who have any competent share of fame. At the first of these\r\ntables are to be placed in their order the twelve most famous persons\r\nin the world, not with regard to the things they are famous for, but\r\naccording to the degree of their fame, whether in valour, wit, or\r\nlearning. Thus, if a scholar be more famous than a soldier, he is to\r\nsit above him. Neither must any preference be given to virtue, if the\r\nperson be not equally famous.\r\n\r\nWhen the first table is filled, the next in renown must be seated\r\nat the second, and so on in like manner to the number of twenty; as\r\nalso in the same order at the third, which is to hold an hundred. At\r\nthese tables no regard is to be had to seniority: for if Julius Cæsar\r\nshall be judged more famous than Romulus and Scipio, he must have the\r\nprecedence. No person who has not been dead an hundred years must\r\nbe offered to a place at any of these tables; and because this is\r\naltogether a lay society, and that sacred persons move upon greater\r\nmotives than that of fame, no persons celebrated in Holy Writ, or any\r\necclesiastical men whatsoever, are to be introduced here.\r\n\r\nAt the lower end of the room is to be a side-table for persons of\r\ngreat fame, but dubious existence, such as Hercules, Theseus, Æneas,\r\nAchilles, Hector, and others. But because it is apprehended that there\r\nmay be great contention about precedence, the proposer humbly desires\r\nthe opinion of the learned towards his assistance in placing every\r\nperson according to his rank, that none may have just occasion of\r\noffence.\r\n\r\nThe merits of the cause shall be judged by plurality of voices.\r\n\r\nFor the more impartial execution of this important affair, it is\r\ndesired that no man will offer his favourite hero, scholar, or poet;\r\nand that the learned will be pleased to send to Mr. Bickerstaff, at Mr.\r\nMorphew's, near Stationers' Hall, their several lists for the first\r\ntable only, and in the order they would have them placed; after which\r\nthe composer will compare the several lists, and make another for the\r\npublic, wherein every name shall be ranked according to the voices it\r\nhas had. Under this chamber is to be a dark vault for the same number\r\nof persons of evil fame.\r\n\r\nIt is humbly submitted to consideration, whether the project would not\r\nbe better if the persons of true fame meet in a middle room, those of\r\ndubious existence in an upper room, and those of evil fame in a lower\r\ndark room.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that no historians are to be admitted at any of these\r\ntables, because they are appointed to conduct the several persons to\r\ntheir seats, and are to be made use of as ushers to the assemblies.\r\n\r\nI call upon the learned world to send me their assistance towards this\r\ndesign, it being a matter of too great moment for any one person to\r\ndetermine. But I do assure them, their lists shall be examined with\r\ngreat fidelity, and those that are exposed to the public, made with all\r\nthe caution imaginable.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, while I wait for these lists, I am employed in keeping\r\npeople in a right way to avoid the contrary to fame and applause, to\r\nwit, blame and derision. For this end I work upon that useful project\r\nof the penny-post,[130] by the benefit of which it is proposed that a\r\ncharitable society be established: from which society there shall go\r\nevery day circular letters to all parts within the bills of mortality,\r\nto tell people of their faults in a friendly and private manner,\r\nwhereby you may know what the world thinks of them, before it is\r\ndeclared to the world that they are thus faulty. This method cannot\r\nfail of universal good consequences: for it is further added, that they\r\nwho will not be reformed by it, must be contented to see the several\r\nletters printed, which were not regarded by them, that when they will\r\nnot take private reprehension, they may be tried further by a public\r\none. I am very sorry I am obliged to print the following epistles of\r\nthat kind to some persons, and the more because they are of the fair\r\nsex. This went on Friday last to a very fine lady.\r\n\r\n     \"MADAM,\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"I am highly sensible that there is nothing of so tender a nature\r\n     as the reputation and conduct of ladies; and that when there is\r\n     the least stain got into their fame, it is hardly ever to be\r\n     washed out. When I have said this, you will believe I am extremely\r\n     concerned to hear at every visit I make, that your manner of\r\n     wearing your hair is a mere affectation of beauty, as well as\r\n     that your neglect of powder has been a common evil to your sex.\r\n     It is to you an advantage to show that abundance of fine tresses;\r\n     but I beseech you to consider that the force of your beauty, and\r\n     the imitation of you, costs Eleonora great sums of money to her\r\n     tire-woman for false locks, besides what is allowed to her maid\r\n     for keeping the secret that she is grey. I must take leave to add\r\n     to this admonition, that you are not to reign above four months\r\n     and odd days longer. Therefore I must desire you to raise and\r\n     frizz your hair a little, for it is downright insolence to be thus\r\n     handsome without art; and you'll forgive me for entreating you to\r\n     do now out of compassion, what you must soon do out of necessity.\r\n     I am,\r\n\r\n  \"Madam,\r\n  Your most obedient and most humble Servant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis person dresses just as she did before I writ: as does also the\r\nlady to whom I addressed the following billet the same day:\r\n\r\n     \"MADAM,\r\n\r\n     \"Let me beg of you to take off the patches at the lower end of\r\n     your left cheek, and I will allow two more under your left eye,\r\n     which will contribute more to the symmetry of your face; except\r\n     you would please to remove the ten black atoms on your ladyship's\r\n     chin, and wear one large patch instead of them. If so, you may\r\n     properly enough retain the three patches above-mentioned. I am,\r\n     &c.\"\r\n\r\nThis, I thought, had all the civility and reason in the world in it;\r\nbut whether my letters are intercepted, or whatever it is, the lady\r\npatches as she used to do. It is to be observed by all the charitable\r\nsociety, as an instruction in their epistles, that they tell people\r\nof nothing but what is in their power to mend. I shall give another\r\ninstance of this way of writing: Two sisters in Essex Street are\r\neternally gaping out of the window, as if they knew not the value of\r\ntime, or would call in companions. Upon which I writ the following line:\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR CREATURES,\r\n\r\n     \"On the receipt of this, shut your casements.\"\r\n\r\nBut I went by yesterday, and found them still at the window. What\r\ncan a man do in this case, but go on, and wrap himself up in his own\r\nintegrity, with satisfaction only in this melancholy truth, that\r\nvirtue is its own reward, and that if no one is the better for his\r\nadmonitions, yet he is himself the more virtuous in that he gave those\r\nadvices.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. James's Coffee-house, Sept. 12._\r\n\r\nLetters of the 18th instant from the Duke of Marlborough's camp at\r\nHavre advise, that the necessary dispositions were made for opening the\r\ntrenches before Mons. The direction of the siege is to be committed to\r\nthe Prince of Orange, who designed to take his post accordingly with\r\nthirty battalions and thirty squadrons on the day following. On the\r\n17th, Lieutenant-General Cadogan set out for Brussels, to hasten the\r\nammunition and artillery which is to be employed in this enterprise;\r\nand the confederate army was extended from the Aisne to the Trouille,\r\nin order to cover the siege. The loss of the confederates in the late\r\nbattle is not exactly known; but it appears by a list transmitted\r\nto the States-General, that the number of the killed and wounded in\r\ntheir service amounts to about eight thousand. It is computed that\r\nthe English have lost 1500 men, and the rest of the allies about five\r\nthousand, including the wounded. The States-General have taken the most\r\nspeedy and effectual measures for reinforcing their troops; and 'tis\r\nexpected that in eight or ten days the army will be as numerous as\r\nbefore the battle. The affairs in Italy afford us nothing remarkable;\r\nonly that it is hoped the difference between the Courts of Vienna and\r\nTurin will be speedily accommodated. Letters from Poland present us\r\nwith a near prospect of seeing King Augustus re-established on the\r\nthrone, all parties being very industrious to reconcile themselves to\r\nhis interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will's Coffee-house, Sept. 12._\r\n\r\nOf all the pretty arts in which our modern writers excel, there is\r\nnot any which is more to be recommended to the imitation of beginners\r\nthan the skill of transition from one subject to another. I know not\r\nwhether I make myself well understood; but it is certain, that the\r\nway of stringing a discourse, used in the _Mercury Gallant_,[131] the\r\n_Gentleman's Journal_,[132] and other learned writings, not to mention\r\nhow naturally things present themselves to such as harangue in pulpits,\r\nand other occasions which occur to the learned, are methods worthy\r\ncommendation. I shall attempt this style myself in a few lines. Suppose\r\nI were discoursing upon the King of Sweden's passing the Boristhenes.\r\nThe Boristhenes is a great river, and puts me in mind of the Danube\r\nand the Rhine. The Danube I cannot think of without reflecting on that\r\nunhappy prince who had such fair territories on the banks of it; I mean\r\nthe Duke of Bavaria, who by our last letters is retired from Mons. Mons\r\nis as strong a fortification as any which has no citadel; and places\r\nwhich are not completely fortified, are, methinks, lessons to princes,\r\nthat they are not omnipotent, but liable to the strokes of fortune. But\r\nas all princes are subject to such calamities, it is the part of men\r\nof letters to guard them from the observations of all small writers:\r\nfor which reason I shall conclude my present remarks by publishing the\r\nfollowing advertisement, to be taken notice of by all who dwell in the\r\nsuburbs of learning.\r\n\r\n     \"Whereas the King of Sweden has been so unfortunate to receive\r\n     a wound in his heel; we do hereby prohibit all epigrammatists\r\n     in either language, and both universities, as well as all other\r\n     poets, of what denomination soever, to make any mention of\r\n     Achilles having received his death's wound in the same part.\r\n\r\n     \"We do likewise forbid all comparisons in coffee-houses between\r\n     Alexander the Great and the said King of Sweden, and from making\r\n     any parallels between the death of Patkul and Philotas;[133]\r\n     we being very apprehensive of the reflections that several\r\n     politicians have ready by them to produce on this occasion, and\r\n     being willing, as much as in us lies, to free the town from all\r\n     impertinences of this nature.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[125] See No. 21.\r\n\r\n[126] See Nos. 54, 61.\r\n\r\n[127] See Nos. 1, 56, 59.\r\n\r\n[128] See Nos. 44, 47.\r\n\r\n[129] A portion of this paper, commencing here, and ending with \"all\r\nthe caution imaginable\" (p. 130), is printed in Scott's edition of\r\nSwift's Works, and was no doubt by the Dean.

In 1709, Charles Povey, a projector, started a\r\nhalfpenny carriage of letters for the Metropolis, but in November the\r\npostmasters-general brought an action against him for an infringement\r\nof their monopoly, and Povey was fined £100.\r\n\r\n[131] The _Mercure Gallant_ was published in 1673 and following years.\r\nA new periodical of the same name was begun in 1710.\r\n\r\n[132] The _Gentleman's Journal; or, the Monthly Miscellany_, was\r\npublished by Motteux between 1692 and 1694, in quarto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 68. [STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, Sept. 13_, to _Thursday, Sept. 15, 1709_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Sept. 14._[134]\r\n\r\nThe progress of our endeavours will of necessity be very much\r\ninterrupted, except the learned world will please to send their lists\r\nto the chamber of fame[135] with all expedition. There is nothing can\r\nso much contribute to create a noble emulation in our youth, as the\r\nhonourable mention of such whose actions have outlived the injuries of\r\ntime, and recommended themselves so far to the world, that it is become\r\nlearning to know the least circumstance of their affairs. It is a great\r\nincentive to see that some men have raised themselves so highly above\r\ntheir fellow-creatures; that the lives of ordinary men are spent in\r\ninquiries after the particular actions of the most illustrious. True\r\nit is, that without this impulse to fame and reputation, our industry\r\nwould stagnate, and that lively desire of pleasing each other die\r\naway. This opinion was so established in the heathen world, that their\r\nsense of living appeared insipid, except their being was enlivened\r\nwith a consciousness that they were esteemed by the rest of the world.\r\nUpon examining the proportion of men's fame for my table of twelve, I\r\nthought it no ill way, since I had laid it down for a rule, that they\r\nwere to be ranked simply as they were famous, without regard to their\r\nvirtue, to ask my sister Jenny's advice, and particularly mentioned\r\nto her the name of Aristotle. She immediately told me, he was a very\r\ngreat scholar, and that she had read him at the boarding-school. She\r\ncertainly means a trifle sold by the hawkers, called \"Aristotle's\r\nProblems.\" But this raised a great scruple in me, whether a fame\r\nincreased by imposition of others is to be added to his account, or\r\nthat these excrescences, which grow out of his real reputation, and\r\ngive encouragement to others to pass things under the cover of his\r\nname, should be considered in giving him his seat in the chamber? This\r\npunctilio is referred to the learned. In the meantime, so ill-natured\r\nare mankind, that I believe I have names already sent me sufficient to\r\nfill up my lists for the dark room, and every one is apt enough to send\r\nin their accounts of ill deservers. This malevolence does not proceed\r\nfrom a real dislike of virtue, but a diabolical prejudice against it,\r\nwhich makes men willing to destroy what they care not to imitate. Thus\r\nyou see the greatest characters among your acquaintance, and those you\r\nlive with, are traduced by all below them in virtue, who never mention\r\nthem but with an exception. However, I believe I shall not give the\r\nworld much trouble about filling my tables for those of evil fame, for\r\nI have some thoughts of clapping up the sharpers there as fast as I can\r\nlay hold of them.\r\n\r\nAt present, I am employed in looking over the several notices which\r\nI have received of their manner of dexterity, and the way at dice of\r\nmaking all rugg,[136] as the cant is. The whole art of securing a\r\ndie has lately been sent me by a person who was of the fraternity,\r\nbut is disabled by the loss of a finger, by which means he cannot\r\npractise that trick as he used to do. But I am very much at a loss how\r\nto call some of the fair sex who are accomplices with the knights of\r\nindustry; for my metaphorical dogs are easily enough understood; but\r\nthe feminine gender of dog has so harsh a sound, that we know not how\r\nto name it. But I am credibly informed that there are female dogs as\r\nvoracious as the males, and make advances to young fellows, without\r\nany other design but coming to a familiarity with their purses. I have\r\nalso long lists of persons of condition, who are certainly of the same\r\nregimen with these banditti, and instrumental to their cheats upon\r\nundiscerning men of their own rank. These add their good reputation\r\nto carry on the impostures of others, whose very names would else be\r\ndefence enough against falling into their hands. But for the honour\r\nof our nation, these shall be unmentioned, provided we hear no more\r\nof such practices, and that they shall not from henceforward suffer\r\nthe society of such as they know to be the common enemies of order,\r\ndiscipline, and virtue. If it appear that they go on in encouraging\r\nthem, they must be proceeded against according to severest rules of\r\nhistory, where all is to be laid before the world with impartiality,\r\nand without respect to persons.\r\n\r\n    _So let the stricken deer go weep._[137]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will's Coffee-house, September 14._\r\n\r\nI find left here for me the following epistle:\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"Having lately read your discourse about the family of\r\n     Trubies,[138] wherein you observe that there are some who fall\r\n     into laughter out of a certain benevolence in their temper, and\r\n     not out of the ordinary motive, viz., contempt and triumph over\r\n     the imperfections of others, I have conceived a good idea of your\r\n     knowledge of mankind. And as you have a tragi-comic genius, I beg\r\n     the favour of you to give us your thoughts of a quite different\r\n     effect, which also is caused by other motives than what are\r\n     commonly taken notice of. What I would have you treat of, is, the\r\n     cause of shedding tears. I desire you would discuss it a little,\r\n     with observations upon the various occasions which provoke us to\r\n     that expression of our concern, &c.\"\r\n\r\nTo obey this complaisant gentleman, I know no way so short as examining\r\nthe various touches of my own bosom, on several occurrences in a long\r\nlife, to the evening of which I am arrived, after as many various\r\nincidents as anybody has met with. I have often reflected, that there\r\nis a great similitude in the motions of the heart in mirth and in\r\nsorrow; and I think the usual occasion of the latter, as well as the\r\nformer, is something which is sudden and unexpected. The mind has\r\nnot a sufficient time to recollect its force, and immediately gushes\r\ninto tears before we can utter ourselves by speech or complaint. The\r\nmost notorious causes of these drops from our eyes, are pity, sorrow,\r\njoy, and reconciliation. The fair sex, who are made of man, and not\r\nof earth, have a more delicate humanity than we have, and pity is the\r\nmost common cause of their tears: for as we are inwardly composed of an\r\naptitude to every circumstance of life, and everything that befalls any\r\none person might have happened to any other of human race, self-love,\r\nand a sense of the pain we ourselves should suffer in the circumstances\r\nof any whom we pity, is the cause of that compassion. Such a reflection\r\nin the breast of a woman immediately inclines her to tears; but in a\r\nman, it makes him think how such a one ought to act on that occasion,\r\nsuitable to the dignity of his nature. Thus a woman is ever moved for\r\nthose whom she hears lament, and a man for those whom he observes to\r\nsuffer in silence. It is a man's own behaviour in the circumstances he\r\nis under which procures him the esteem of others, and not merely the\r\naffliction itself which demands our pity: for we never give a man that\r\npassion which he falls into for himself. He that commends himself never\r\npurchases our applause; nor he who bewails himself, our pity. Going\r\nthrough an alley the other day, I observed a noisy impudent beggar bawl\r\nout, that he was wounded in a merchantman, that he had lost his poor\r\nlimbs, and showed a leg clouted up. All that passed by, made what haste\r\nthey could out of sight and hearing. But a poor fellow at the end of\r\nthe passage, with a rusty coat, a melancholy air, and a soft voice,\r\ndesired them to look upon a man not used to beg. The latter received\r\nthe charity of almost every one that went by. The strings of the heart,\r\nwhich are to be touched to give us compassion, are not so played on\r\nbut by the finest hand. We see in tragical representations it is not\r\nthe pomp of language, or magnificence of dress, in which the passion\r\nis wrought that touches sensible spirits, but something of a plain and\r\nsimple nature which breaks in upon our souls, by that sympathy which\r\nis given us for our mutual good-will and service.[139] In the tragedy\r\nof \"Macbeth,\" where Wilks[140] acts the part of a man whose family\r\nhas been murdered in his absence, the wildness of his passion, which\r\nis run over in a torrent of calamitous circumstances, does but raise\r\nmy spirits, and give me the alarm; but when he skilfully seems to be\r\nout of breath, and is brought too low to say more, and upon a second\r\nreflection, cry, only wiping his eyes, \"What, both children! Both, both\r\nmy children gone!\" there is no resisting a sorrow which seems to have\r\ncast about for all the reasons possible for its consolation, but has\r\nno recourse. There is not one left, but both, both are murdered![141]\r\nSuch sudden starts from the thread of the discourse, and a plain\r\nsentiment expressed in an artless way, are the irresistible strokes of\r\neloquence and poetry. The same great master, Shakespeare, can afford us\r\ninstances of all the places where our souls are accessible, and ever\r\ncommands our tears; but it is to be observed, that he draws them from\r\nsome unexpected source, which seems not wholly of a piece with the\r\ndiscourse. Thus when Brutus and Cassius had a debate in the tragedy\r\nof \"Cæsar,\" and rose to warm language against each other, insomuch\r\nthat it had almost come to something that might be fatal, till they\r\nrecollected themselves; Brutus does more than make an apology for the\r\nheat he had been in, by saying, \"Porcia is dead.\"[142] Here Cassius is\r\nall tenderness, and ready to dissolve, when he considers that the mind\r\nof his friend had been employed on the greatest affliction imaginable,\r\nwhen he had been adding to it by a debate on trifles; which makes him\r\nin the anguish of his heart cry out, \"How scaped I killing when I thus\r\nprovoked you?\"[143] This is an incident which moves the soul in all\r\nits sentiments; and Cassius's heart was at once touched with all the\r\nsoft pangs of pity, remorse, and reconciliation. It is said indeed by\r\nHorace, \"If you would have me weep, you must first weep yourself.\"[144]\r\nThis is not literally true, for it would have been as rightly said,\r\nif we observe nature, that I shall certainly weep if you do not; but\r\nwhat is intended by that expression is, that it is not possible to give\r\npassion except you show that you suffer yourself. Therefore the true\r\nart seems to be, that when you would have the person you represent\r\npitied, you must show him at once, in the highest grief and struggling,\r\nto bear it with decency and patience. In this case, we sigh for him,\r\nand give him every groan he suppresses.[145] I remember, when I was\r\nyoung enough to follow the sports of the field, I have more than\r\nonce rode off at the death of a deer, when I have seen the animal in\r\nan affliction which appeared human without the least noise, let fall\r\ntears when he was reduced to extremity; and I have thought of the\r\nsorrow I saw him in when his haunch came to the table. But our tears\r\nare not given only to objects of pity, but the mind has recourse to\r\nthat relief on all occasions which give us much emotion. Thus, to be\r\napt to shed tears is a sign of a great as well as little spirit. I\r\nhave heard say, the present Pope[146] never passes through the people,\r\nwho always kneel in crowds and ask his benediction, but the tears are\r\nseen to flow from his eyes. This must proceed from an imagination that\r\nhe is the father of all those people, and that he is touched with so\r\nextensive a benevolence that it breaks out into a passion of tears. You\r\nsee friends, who have been long absent, transported in the same manner:\r\na thousand little images crowd upon them at their meeting, as all the\r\njoys and griefs they have known during their separation; and in one\r\nhurry of thought, they conceive how they should have participated in\r\nthose occasions, and weep, because their minds are too full to wait the\r\nslow expression of words.\r\n\r\n    _His lacrimis vitam damus, et miseressimus ultro._[147]\r\n\r\nThere is lately broke loose from the London Pack[148] a very tall\r\ndangerous biter. He is now at the Bath, and it is feared will make\r\na damnable havoc amongst the game. His manner of biting is new, and\r\ncalled the Top. He secures one die betwixt his two fingers: the other\r\nis fixed by the help of a famous wax invented by an apothecary, since a\r\ngamester; a little of which he puts upon his forefinger, and that holds\r\nthe die in the box at his devotion. Great sums have been lately won by\r\nthese ways; but it is hoped that this hint of his manner of cheating\r\nwill open the eyes of many who are every day imposed upon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is now in the press, and will be suddenly published, a book\r\nentitled \"An Appendix to the Contempt of the Clergy,\"[149] wherein\r\nwill be set forth at large, that all our dissensions are owing to\r\nthe laziness of persons in the sacred ministry, and that none of the\r\npresent schisms could have crept into the flock but by the negligence\r\nof the pastors. There is a digression in this treatise, proving that\r\nthe pretences made by the priesthood from time to time that the Church\r\nwas in danger, is only a trick to make the laity passionate for that of\r\nwhich they themselves have been negligent. The whole concludes with an\r\nexhortation to the clergy, to the study of eloquence, and practice of\r\npiety, as the only method to support the highest of all honours, that\r\nof a priest, who lives and acts according to his character.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[133] Philotas, son of Parmenion, was one of the generals of Alexander\r\nthe Great. He was arrested for treason, made a confession under\r\ntorture, and was stoned before the troops. Jean Reinhold de Patkul\r\n(1660-1707), a Livonian nobleman in disgrace at the Swedish Court,\r\nfound his way to King Augustus, in Poland, and was charged with\r\nhaving instigated that monarch to attack Livonia. When a treaty of\r\npeace was drawn up, Charles XII. made the surrender of Patkul one of\r\nthe conditions; and after much delay he was handed over to General\r\nMeyerfeldt, and broken upon the wheel in October 1707. In the _Review_\r\nfor August 20, 1709, Defoe criticised the conduct of Charles XII. in\r\nthis matter, and said that since his barbarous action he had had no\r\nsuccess. He paid dear for the blood of Patkul.\r\n\r\n[134] This article is printed in Scott's edition of Swift's Works.\r\n\r\n[135] See No. 67.\r\n\r\n[136] See No. 39.\r\n\r\n[137] \"Why, let the stricken deer go weep\" (\"Hamlet,\" act iii. sc. 2,\r\nl. 282.)\r\n\r\n[138] See No. 63.\r\n\r\n[139] _Cf._ No. 47.\r\n\r\n[140] See No. 19.\r\n\r\n[141] \"Julius Cæsar,\" act iv. sc. 3.\r\n\r\n[142] Steevens brought forward the fact that the author of the _Tatler_\r\nhere quotes from Davenant's alteration of Shakespeare's play as an\r\nargument to prove how little Shakespeare was read.

In me, indeed, that\r\nword raises a quite different idea from what it usually does in others;\r\nbut perhaps that proceeds from my being old, and beginning to want the\r\nrelish of such satisfactions as are the ordinary entertainment of men.\r\nHowever, such as my opinion is in this case, I will speak it; because\r\nit is possible that turn of thought may be received by others, who may\r\nreap as much tranquillity from it as I do myself. It is to me a very\r\ngreat meanness, and something much below a philosopher, which is what I\r\nmean by a gentleman, to rank a man among the vulgar for the condition\r\nof life he is in, and not according to his behaviour, his thoughts\r\nand sentiments, in that condition. For if a man be loaded with riches\r\nand honours, and in that state of life has thoughts and inclinations\r\nbelow the meanest artificer; is not such an artificer, who within his\r\npower is good to his friends, moderate in his demands for his labour,\r\nand cheerful in his occupation, very much superior to him who lives\r\nfor no other end but to serve himself, and assumes a preference in\r\nall his words and actions to those who act their part with much more\r\ngrace than himself? Epictetus has made use of the similitude of a\r\nstage-play to human life with much spirit. \"It is not,\" says he, \"to be\r\nconsidered among the actors, who is prince, or who is beggar, but who\r\nacts prince or beggar best.\"[150] The circumstance of life should not\r\nbe that which gives us place, but our behaviour in that circumstance\r\nis what should be our solid distinction. Thus, a wise man should think\r\nno man above him or below him, any further than it regards the outward\r\norder and discipline of the world: for if we take too great an idea\r\nof the eminence of our superiors, or subordination of our inferiors,\r\nit will have an ill effect upon our behaviour to both. But he who\r\nthinks no man above him but for his virtue, none below him but for his\r\nvice, can never be obsequious or assuming in a wrong place, but will\r\nfrequently emulate men in rank below him, and pity those above him.\r\nThis sense of mankind is so far from a levelling principle, that it\r\nonly sets us upon a true basis of distinction, and doubles the merit\r\nof such as become their condition. A man in power, who can, without\r\nthe ordinary prepossessions which stop the way to the true knowledge\r\nand service of mankind, overlook the little distinctions of fortune,\r\nraise obscure merit, and discountenance successful indesert,[151]\r\nhas, in the minds of knowing men, the figure of an angel rather than\r\na man, and is above the rest of men in the highest character he can\r\nbe, even that of their benefactor. Turning my thoughts as I was taking\r\nmy pipe this evening after this manner, it was no small delight to me\r\nto receive advice from Felicia,[152] that Eboracensis was appointed a\r\ngovernor of one of their plantations.[153] As I am a great lover of\r\nmankind, I took part in the happiness of that people who were to be\r\ngoverned by one of so great humanity, justice, and honour. Eboracensis\r\nhas read all the schemes which writers have formed of government and\r\norder, and been long conversant with men who have the reins in their\r\nhands; so that he can very well distinguish between chimerical and\r\npractical politics. It is a great blessing (when men have to deal with\r\nsuch different characters in the same species as those of free-men\r\nand slaves) that they who command have a just sense of human nature\r\nitself, by which they can temper the haughtiness of the master, and\r\nsoften the servitude of the slave. \"Hæ tibi erunt artes.\"[154] This is\r\nthe notion with which those of the plantation receive Eboracensis: and\r\nas I have cast his nativity, I find it will be a record made of this\r\nperson's administrations; and on that part of the shore from whence he\r\nembarks to return from his government, there will be a monument with\r\nthese words: \"Here the people wept, and took leave of Eboracensis, the\r\nfirst governor our mother Felicia sent, who, during his command here,\r\nbelieved himself her subject.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_White's Chocolate-house, Sept. 16._\r\n\r\nThe following letter wants such sudden despatch, that all things else\r\nmust wait for this time.\r\n\r\n  \"SIR,\r\n\r\n  _Sept. 13, equal day and night._\r\n\r\n     \"There are two ladies, who, having a good opinion of your taste\r\n     and judgment, desire you to make use of them in the following\r\n     particular, which perhaps you may allow very particular. The two\r\n     ladies before mentioned have a considerable time since contracted\r\n     a more sincere and constant friendship than their adversaries the\r\n     men will allow consistent with the frailty of female nature; and\r\n     being from a long acquaintance convinced of the perfect agreement\r\n     of their tempers, have thought upon an expedient to prevent their\r\n     separation, and cannot think any so effectual (since it is common\r\n     for love to destroy friendship) as to give up both their liberties\r\n     to the same person in marriage. The gentleman they have pitched\r\n     upon, is neither well-bred nor agreeable, his understanding\r\n     moderate, and his person never designed to charm women; but\r\n     having so much self-interest in his nature, as to be satisfied\r\n     with making double contracts, upon condition of receiving double\r\n     fortunes; and most men being so far sensible of the uneasiness\r\n     that one woman occasions, they think him for these reasons\r\n     the most likely person of their acquaintance to receive these\r\n     proposals. Upon all other accounts, he is the last man either of\r\n     them would choose, yet for this preferable to all the rest. They\r\n     desire to know your opinion the next post, resolving to defer\r\n     further proceeding, till they have received it. I am, Sir,\r\n\r\n  \"Your unknown, unthought-of,\r\n  Humble Servant,\r\n  BRIDGET EITHERSIDE.\"\r\n\r\n     #/\r\n\r\nThis is very extraordinary, and much might be objected by me,\r\nwho am something of a civilian, to the case of two marrying the\r\nsame man; but these ladies are, I perceive, free-thinkers, and\r\ntherefore I shall speak only to the prudential part of this design,\r\nmerely as a philosopher, without entering into the merit of it in\r\nthe ecclesiastical or civil law. These constant friends, Piledea\r\nand Orestea, are at a loss to preserve their friendship from the\r\nencroachments of love, for which end they have resolved upon a fellow\r\nwho cannot be the object of affection or esteem to either, and\r\nconsequently cannot rob one of the place each has in her friend's\r\nheart. But in all my reading (and I have read all that the sages in\r\nlove have written), I have found the greatest danger in jealousy. The\r\nladies indeed, to avoid this passion, choose a sad fellow; but if they\r\nwould be advised by me, they had better have each their worthless\r\nman; otherwise, he that was despicable while he was indifferent to\r\nthem, will become valuable when he seems to prefer one to the other.\r\nI remember in the history of Don Quixote of the Manca, there is a\r\nmemorable passage which opens to us the weakness of our nature in\r\nsuch particulars. The Don falls into discourse with a gentleman[155]\r\nwhom he calls the Knight of the Green Cassock, and is invited to his\r\nhouse. When he comes there, he runs into discourse and panegyric upon\r\nthe economy, the government and order of his family, the education of\r\nhis children; and lastly, on the singular wisdom of him who disposed\r\nthings with that exactness. The gentleman makes a soliloquy to himself,\r\n\"Oh irresistible power of flattery! Though I know this is a madman, I\r\ncannot help being taken with his applause.\"\r\n\r\nThe ladies will find this much more true in the case of their lover;\r\nand the woman he most likes, will certainly be more pleased; she whom\r\nhe flights, more offended, than she can imagine before she has tried.\r\nNow I humbly propose, that they both marry coxcombs whom they are\r\nsure they cannot like, and then they may be pretty secure against the\r\nchange of affection, which they fear; and by that means, preserving the\r\ntemperature under which they now write, enjoy during life, \"equal day\r\nand night.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. James's Coffee-house, Sept. 16._\r\n\r\nThere is no manner of news; but people now spend their time in\r\ncoffee-houses in reflections upon the particulars of the late glorious\r\nday,[156] and collecting the several parts of the action, as they are\r\nproduced in letters from private hands, or notices given to us by\r\naccounts in public papers. A pleasant gentleman, alluding to the great\r\nfences through which we pierced, said this evening, \"The French thought\r\nthemselves on the right side of the hedge, but it proved otherwise.\"\r\nMr. Kidney, who has long conversed with, and filled tea for the most\r\nconsummate politicians, was pleased to give me an account of this piece\r\nof ribaldry, and desired me on that occasion to write a whole paper\r\non the subject of valour, and explain how that quality, which must be\r\npossessed by whole armies, is so highly preferable in one man rather\r\nthan another, and how the same actions are but mere acts of duty in\r\nsome, and instances of the most heroic virtue in others. He advised me\r\nnot to fail in this discourse to mention the gallantry of the Prince\r\nof Nassau in this last engagement, who (when a battalion made a halt\r\nin the face of the enemy) snatched the colours out of the hands of the\r\nensign, and planted them just before the line of the enemy, calling to\r\nthat battalion to take care of their colours, if they had no regard to\r\nhim. Mr. Kidney has my promise to obey him in this particular on the\r\nfirst occasion that offers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Bickerstaff is now compiling exact accounts of the pay of the\r\nmilitia, and the commission officers under the respective Lieutenancies\r\nof Great Britain: in the first place, of those of London and\r\nWestminster; and in regard that there are no common soldiers, but all\r\nhouse-keepers, or representatives of house-keepers in these bodies,\r\nthe sums raised by the officers shall be looked into, and their\r\nfellow-soldiers, or rather fellow-travellers from one part of the\r\ntown to the other, not defrauded of the ten pounds allowed for the\r\nsubsistence of the troops.\r\n\r\nWhereas not very long since, at a tavern between Fleet Bridge and\r\nCharing Cross, some certain polite gentlemen thought fit to perform\r\nthe bacchanalian exercises of devotion, by dancing without clothes on,\r\nafter the manner of the pre-Adamites; this is to certify those persons,\r\nthat there is no manner of wit or humour in the said practice, and that\r\nthe beadles of the parish are to be at their next meeting, where it is\r\nto be examined, whether they are arrived at want of feeling, as well as\r\nwant of shame.\r\n\r\nWhereas a chapel clerk was lately taken in a garret on a flock-bed\r\nwith two of the fair sex, who are usually employed in sifting cinders;\r\nthis is to let him know, that if he persists in being a scandal both\r\nto laity and clergy (as being as it were both and neither), the names\r\nof the nymphs who were with him shall be printed; therefore he is\r\ndesired, as he tenders the reputation of his ladies, to repent.\r\n\r\nMr. Bickerstaff has received information, that an eminent and noble\r\npreacher in the chief congregation of Great Britain, for fear of being\r\nthought guilty of presbyterian fervency and extemporary prayer, lately\r\nread his, before sermon; but the same advices acknowledging that he\r\nmade the congregation large amends by the shortness of his discourse,\r\nit is thought fit to make no further observation upon it.[157]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[150] \"Encheiridion,\" sect. xvii.

These testimonials are customary with us\r\nlearned men, and sometimes are suspected to be written by the author;\r\nbut I fear no one will suspect me of this.\r\n\r\n  \"SIR,\r\n\r\n  _London, Sept. 15, 1709._\r\n\r\n     \"Having read your lucubrations of the 10th instant,[159] I can't\r\n     but entirely agree with you in your notions of the scarcity of\r\n     men who can either read or speak. For my part, I have lived these\r\n     thirty years in the world, and yet have observed but a very few\r\n     who could do either in any tolerable manner; among which few,\r\n     you must understand that I reckon myself. How far eloquence,\r\n     set off with the proper ornaments of voice and gesture, will\r\n     prevail over the passions, and how cold and unaffecting the\r\n     best oration in the world would be without them, there are two\r\n     remarkable instances in the case of Ligarius and that of Milo.\r\n     Cæsar had condemned Ligarius. He came indeed to hear what might\r\n     be said; but thinking himself his own master, resolved not to be\r\n     biassed by anything Cicero could say in his behalf: but in this\r\n     he was mistaken; for when the orator began to speak, the hero is\r\n     moved, he is vanquished, and at length the criminal absolved. It\r\n     must be observed, that this famous orator was less renowned for\r\n     his courage than his eloquence; for though he came at another\r\n     time, prepared to defend Milo with one of the best orations that\r\n     antiquity has produced; yet being seized with a sudden fear by\r\n     seeing some armed men surrounding the Forum, he faltered in his\r\n     speech, and became unable to exert that irresistible force and\r\n     beauty of action which would have saved his client, and for want\r\n     of which he was condemned to banishment. As the success the former\r\n     of these orations met with, appears chiefly owing to the life and\r\n     graceful manner with which it was recited (for some there are who\r\n     think it may be read without transport), so the latter seems to\r\n     have failed of success for no other reason, but because the orator\r\n     was not in a condition to set it off with those ornaments. It\r\n     must be confessed, that artful sound will with the crowd prevail\r\n     even more than sense; but those who are masters of both, will\r\n     ever gain the admiration of all their hearers: and there is, I\r\n     think, a very natural account to be given of this matter; for the\r\n     sensation of the head and heart are caused in each of these parts\r\n     by the outward organs of the eye and ear: that therefore which is\r\n     conveyed to the understanding and passions by only one of these\r\n     organs, will not affect us so much as that which is transmitted\r\n     through both.[160] I can't but think your charge is just against\r\n     a great part of the learned clergy of Great Britain, who deliver\r\n     the most excellent discourses with such coldness and indifference,\r\n     that it is no great wonder the unintelligent many of their\r\n     congregations fall asleep. Thus it happens that their orations\r\n     meet with a quite contrary fate to that of Demosthenes you\r\n     mentioned; for as that lost much of its beauty and force by being\r\n     repeated to the magistrates of Rhodes without the winning action\r\n     of that great orator, so the performances of these gentlemen never\r\n     appear with so little grace, and to so much disadvantage, as when\r\n     delivered by themselves from the pulpit. Hippocrates being sent\r\n     for to a patient in this city, and having felt his pulse, inquired\r\n     into the symptoms of his distemper, and finding that it proceeded\r\n     in great measure from want of sleep, advises his patient, with\r\n     an air of gravity, to be carried to church to hear a sermon, not\r\n     doubting but that it would dispose him for the rest he wanted.\r\n     If some of the rules Horace gives for the theatre, were (not\r\n     improperly) applied to our pulpits, we should not hear a sermon\r\n     prescribed as a good opiate.\r\n\r\n    \"----_Si vis me flere, dolendum est\r\n    Primum ipsi tibi_----[161]\r\n\r\n     \"A man must himself express some concern and affection in\r\n     delivering his discourse, if he expects his auditory should\r\n     interest themselves in what he proposes: for otherwise,\r\n     notwithstanding the dignity and importance of the subject he\r\n     treats of, notwithstanding the weight and argument of the\r\n     discourse itself, yet too many will say,\r\n\r\n    \"----_Male si mandata loqueris,\r\n    Aut dormitabo, aut ridebo._----[162]\r\n\r\n     \"If there be a deficiency in the speaker, there will not be\r\n     a sufficient attention and regard paid to the things spoken:\r\n     but, Mr. Bickerstaff, you know, that as too little action is\r\n     cold, so too much is fulsome. Some indeed may think themselves\r\n     accomplished speakers, for no other reason than because they can\r\n     be loud and noisy (for surely Stentor[163] must have some design\r\n     in his vociferations). But, dear Mr. Bickerstaff, convince them,\r\n     that as harsh and irregular sound is not harmony, so neither is\r\n     banging a cushion, oratory; and therefore, in my humble opinion,\r\n     a certain divine[164] of the first order, whom I allow otherwise\r\n     to be a great man, would do well to leave this off; for I think\r\n     his sermons would be more persuasive if he gave his auditory\r\n     less disturbance. Though I cannot say that this action would be\r\n     wholly improper to a profane oration, yet I think, in a religious\r\n     assembly, it gives a man too warlike, or perhaps too theatrical a\r\n     figure to be suitable to a Christian congregation. I am,\r\n\r\n  \"Sir,\r\n  Your humble Servant, &c.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most learned and ingenious Mr. Rosehat is also pleased to write to\r\nme on this subject.\r\n\r\n     /# \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"I read with great pleasure in the _Tatler_ of Saturday last the\r\n     conversation upon eloquence. Permit me to hint to you one thing\r\n     the great Roman orator observes upon this subject, 'Caput enim\r\n     arbitrabatur oratoris' (he quotes Menedemus, an Athenian), 'ut\r\n     ipsis apud quos ageret talis qualem ipse optaret videretur, id\r\n     fieri vitæ dignitate.[165] It is the first rule in oratory, that a\r\n     man must appear such as he would persuade others to be, and that\r\n     can be accomplished only by the force of his life. I believe it\r\n     might be of great service to let our public orators know, that\r\n     an unnatural gravity, or an unbecoming levity in their behaviour\r\n     out of the pulpit, will take very much from the force of their\r\n     eloquence in it. Excuse another scrap of Latin; it is from one of\r\n     the Fathers: I think it will appear a just observation to all,\r\n     as it may have authority with some: 'Qui autem docent tantum,\r\n     nec faciunt, ipsi præceptis suis detrahunt pondus; quis enim\r\n     obtemperet, quum ipsi præceptores doceant non obtemperare?'

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, Sept. 20_, to _Thursday, Sept. 22, 1709_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Sept. 21._\r\n\r\nI have long been against my inclination employed in satire, and that\r\nin prosecution of such persons who are below the dignity of the true\r\nspirit of it; such who I fear are not to be reclaimed by making them\r\nonly ridiculous. The sharpers therefore shall have a month's time to\r\nthemselves free from the observation of this paper; but I must not make\r\na truce without letting them know, that at the same time I am preparing\r\nfor a more vigorous war; for a friend of mine has promised me, he will\r\nemploy his time in compiling such a tract before the session of the\r\nensuing Parliament, as shall lay gaming home to the bosoms of all who\r\nlove their country or their families; and he doubts not but it will\r\ncreate an Act, that shall make these rogues as scandalous as those less\r\nmischievous ones on the highroad. I have received private intimations\r\nto take care of my walks, and remember there are such things as stabs\r\nand blows: but as there never was anything in this design which ought\r\nto displease a man of honour, or which was not designed to offend the\r\nrascals, I shall give myself very little concern for finding what I\r\nexpected, that they would be highly provoked at these lucubrations. But\r\nthough I utterly despise the pack, I must confess I am at a stand at\r\nthe receipt of the following letter, which seems to be written by a man\r\nof sense and worth, who has mistaken some passage that I am sure was\r\nnot levelled at him. This gentleman's complaints give me compunction,\r\nwhen I neglect the threats of the rascals. I can't be in jest with the\r\nrogues any longer, since they pretend to threaten. I don't know whether\r\nI shall allow them the favour of transportation.\r\n\r\n  \"MR. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n  _Sept. 13._\r\n\r\n     \"Observing you are not content with lashing the many vices of the\r\n     age, without illustrating each with particular characters, it is\r\n     thought nothing would more contribute to the impression you design\r\n     by such, than always having regard to truth. In your _Tatler_ of\r\n     this day,[169] I observe you allow, that nothing is so tender as a\r\n     lady's reputation; that a stain once got in their fame, is hardly\r\n     ever to be washed out. This you grant even when you give yourself\r\n     leave to trifle. If so, what caution is necessary in handling\r\n     the reputation of a man, whose wellbeing in this life perhaps\r\n     entirely depends on preserving it from any wound, which once there\r\n     received, too often becomes fatal and incurable? Suppose some\r\n     villainous hand, through personal prejudice, transmits materials\r\n     for this purpose, which you publish to the world, and afterwards\r\n     become fully convinced you were imposed on (as by this time you\r\n     may be of a character you have sent into the world); I say,\r\n     supposing this, I would be glad to know, what reparation you think\r\n     ought to be made the person so injured, admitting you stood in his\r\n     place. It has always been held, that a generous education is the\r\n     surest mark of a generous mind. The former is indeed perspicuous\r\n     in all your papers; and I am persuaded, though you affect often\r\n     to show the latter, yet you would not keep any measures (even\r\n     of Christianity) with those who should handle you in the manner\r\n     you do others. The application of all this is from your having\r\n     very lately glanced at a man, under a character, that were he\r\n     conscious to deserve, he would be the first to rid the world of\r\n     himself; and would be more justifiable in it to all sorts of men,\r\n     than you in your committing such a violence on his reputation,\r\n     which perhaps you may be convinced of in another manner than you\r\n     deserve from him.\r\n\r\n     \"A man of your capacity, Mr. Bickerstaff, should have more noble\r\n     views, and pursue the true spirit of satire; but I will conclude,\r\n     lest I grow out of temper, and will only beg for your own\r\n     preservation, to remember the proverb of the pitcher.\r\n\r\n  \"I am Yours,\r\n  A. J.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proverb of the pitcher I have no regard to; but it would be an\r\ninsensibility not to be pardoned, if a man could be untouched at so\r\nwarm an accusation, and that laid with so much seeming temper. All I\r\ncan say to it is, that if the writer, by the same method whereby he\r\nconveyed this letter, shall give me an instance wherein I have injured\r\nany good man, or pointed at anything which is not the true object\r\nof raillery, I shall acknowledge the offence in as open a manner\r\nas the press can do it, and lay down this paper for ever. There is\r\nsomething very terrible in unjustly attacking men in a way that may\r\nprejudice their honour or fortune; but when men of too modest a sense\r\nof themselves will think they are touched, it is impossible to prevent\r\nill consequences from the most innocent and general discourses. This I\r\nhave known happen in circumstances the most foreign to theirs who have\r\ntaken offence at them. An advertisement lately published, relating to\r\nOmicron,[170] alarmed a gentleman of good sense, integrity, honour, and\r\nindustry, which is, in every particular, different from the trifling\r\npretenders pointed at in that advertisement. When the modesty of some\r\nis as excessive as the vanity of others, what defence is there against\r\nmisinterpretation? However, giving disturbance, though not intended, to\r\nmen of virtuous characters, has so sincerely troubled me, that I will\r\nbreak from this satirical vein; and to show I very little value myself\r\nupon it, shall for this month ensuing leave the sharper, the fop, the\r\npedant, the proud man, the insolent; in a word, all the train of knaves\r\nand fools, to their own devices, and touch on nothing but panegyric.\r\nThis way is suitable to the true genius of the Staffs, who are much\r\nmore inclined to reward than punish. If therefore the author of the\r\nabove-mentioned letter does not command my silence wholly, as he shall\r\nif I do not give him satisfaction, I shall for the above-mentioned\r\nspace turn my thoughts to raising merit from its obscurity, celebrating\r\nvirtue in its distress, and attacking vice by no other method but\r\nsetting innocence in a proper light.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will's Coffee-house, Sept. 20._\r\n\r\nI find here for me the following letter:[171]\r\n\r\n     \"SQUIRE BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n     \"Finding your advice and censure to have a good effect, I\r\n     desire your admonition to our vicar and schoolmaster, who in\r\n     his preaching to his auditors, stretches his jaws so wide, that\r\n     instead of instructing youth, it rather frightens them: likewise\r\n     in reading prayers, he has such a careless loll, that people\r\n     are justly offended at his irreverent posture; besides the\r\n     extraordinary charge they are put to in sending their children\r\n     to dance, to bring them off of those ill gestures. Another evil\r\n     faculty he has, in making the bowling-green his daily residence,\r\n     instead of his church, where his curate reads prayers every day.\r\n     If the weather is fair, his time is spent in visiting; if cold or\r\n     wet, in bed, or at least at home, though within a hundred yards\r\n     of the church. These, out of many such irregular practices, I\r\n     write for his reclamation: but two or three things more before I\r\n     conclude; to wit, that generally when his curate preaches in the\r\n     afternoon, he sleeps sitting in the desk on a hassock. With all\r\n     this, he is so extremely proud, that he will go but once to the\r\n     sick, except they return his visit.\"\r\n\r\nI was going on in reading my letter, when I was interrupted by Mr.\r\nGreenhat, who has been this evening at the play of \"Hamlet.\" \"Mr.\r\nBickerstaff,\" said he, \"had you been to-night at the play-house,\r\nyou had seen the force of action in perfection: your admired Mr.\r\nBetterton[172] behaved himself so well, that, though now about seventy,\r\nhe acted youth; and by the prevalent power of proper manner, gesture\r\nand voice, appeared through the whole drama a young man of great\r\nexpectation, vivacity, and enterprise. The soliloquy, where he began\r\nthe celebrated sentence of, 'To be, or not to be;' the expostulation\r\nwhere he explains with his mother in her closet; the noble ardour,\r\nafter seeing his father's ghost, and his generous distress for the\r\ndeath of Ophelia, are each of them circumstances which dwell strongly\r\nupon the minds of the audience, and would certainly affect their\r\nbehaviour on any parallel occasions in their own lives. Pray, Mr.\r\nBickerstaff, let us have virtue thus represented on the stage with its\r\nproper ornaments, or let these ornaments be added to her in places more\r\nsacred. As for my part,\" said he, \"I carried my cousin Jerry, this\r\nlittle boy, with me, and shall always love the child for his partiality\r\nin all that concerned the fortune of Hamlet. This is entering youth\r\ninto the affections and passions of manhood beforehand, and as it were\r\nantedating the effects we hope from a long and liberal education.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot in the midst of many other things which press, hide the\r\ncomfort that this letter from my ingenious kinsman gives me.\r\n\r\n  \"_To my Honoured Kinsman_, ISAAC BICKERSTAFF, Esq.\r\n\r\n  \"DEAR COUSIN,\r\n\r\n  _Oxford, Sept. 18._\r\n\r\n     \"I am sorry, though not surprised, to find that you have rallied\r\n     the men of dress in vain; that the amber-headed cane still\r\n     maintains its unstable post; that pockets are but a few inches\r\n     shortened; and a beau is still a beau, from the crown of his\r\n     nightcap to the heels of his shoes. For your comfort, I can\r\n     assure you, that your endeavours succeed better in this famous\r\n     seat of learning. By them, the manners of our young gentlemen are\r\n     in a fair way of amendment, and their very language is mightily\r\n     refined. To them it is owing, that not a servitor will sing a\r\n     catch, not a senior fellow make a pun, not a determining bachelor\r\n     drink a bumper; and I believe a gentleman commoner would as soon\r\n     have the heels of his shoes red as his stockings.

There are various accounts of how he came\r\nto go on to the stage, but in 1661 he joined Sir William Davenant's\r\ncompany at Lincoln's Inn Fields. Davenant's son afterwards gave\r\nBetterton a share in the management, and the company (\"the Duke's\")\r\nmoved to Dorset Garden. In 1682 this company united with the King's\r\ncompany. Betterton lost all his savings in a speculation in 1692. Soon\r\nafterwards the patentee of the theatre quarrelled with the actors about\r\ntheir salaries, and Betterton and his friends obtained a licence to set\r\nup a theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields. Betterton does not seem to have\r\nbeen a good manager, and he was often in straitened circumstances. In\r\nApril 1709 the benefit described in No. 1 of the _Tatler_ was arranged\r\nfor his benefit; on that occasion Betterton, though over seventy, acted\r\nthe youthful part of Valentine in \"Love for Love.\" The performance\r\nbrought Betterton £500. Writing on the occasion of his death, Steele\r\npaid a high tribute to the actor's powers in No. 167.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note what Zachary Baggs, treasurer at Drury Lane,\r\nstated to be the salary paid to, and the amount made by benefits by,\r\nthe principal performers. I quote from a rare quarto paper of two\r\nleaves, issued by Baggs in July 1709 upon the threatened secession of\r\nthe actors. He says that during the season, October 1708 to June 1709,\r\n135 days--\r\n\r\n                                                 £.   _s._      _d._\r\n\r\n  Wilks was paid by salary                      168     6         8\r\n  By his benefit play                            90    14         9\r\n  Betterton was paid, by his salary £4 a week, and\r\n  £1 a week for his wife, although she does\r\n  not act                                       112    10         0\r\n  By a benefit, besides what he got by high prices\r\n  and guineas                                    76     4         5\r\n  Estcourt was paid at £5 a week salary         112    10         0\r\n  By his benefit play                            51     8         6\r\n  Cibber was paid at £5 a week salary           112    10         0\r\n  By his benefit play                            51     0        10\r\n  Mills was paid £4 a week salary, and £1 for\r\n  his wife, for little or nothing               112    10         0\r\n  By his benefit play (not including hers)       58     1         4\r\n  Mrs. Oldfield had £4 a week salary, making\r\n  for fourteen weeks and a day                   56    13         4\r\n  She was also paid for costumes                  2    10         7\r\n  And by her benefit play she had                62     7         8\r\n                                                -------------------\r\n                                    In all    £1077     3         8\r\n\r\nBut Baggs adds that at each benefit performance the actor gained much\r\nby the special prices paid for seats, and estimating those extra\r\nprofits at the benefits above mentioned at £880, he arrives at the\r\nconclusion that the six actors named earned £1957 in all during the\r\nseason, though it was broken in upon by the death of Prince George, and\r\nbrought to a premature close in June.\r\n\r\n[173] Villages near Oxford.\r\n\r\n[174] Epistle \"To my honoured kinsman John Driden, of Chesterton,\r\nEsq.,\" 204:--\r\n\r\n    \"Two of a house few ages can afford,\r\n    One to perform, another to record.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[175] See No. 45.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 72.

But the properest way for me to treat, is to keep in general\r\nupon the passions and affections of men, with as little regard to\r\nparticulars as the nature of the thing will admit. However, I think\r\nthere is something so passionate in the circumstances of the lovers\r\nmentioned in the following letter, that I am willing to go out of my\r\nway to obey what is commanded in it.\r\n\r\n  \"SIR,\r\n\r\n  _London, September 17._\r\n\r\n     \"Your design of entertaining the town with the characters of the\r\n     ancient heroes, as persons shall send an account to Mr. Morphew's,\r\n     encourages me and others to beg of you, that in the meantime (if\r\n     it is not contrary to the method you have proposed) you would give\r\n     us one paper upon the subject of Pætus and his wife's death, when\r\n     Nero sent him an order to kill himself: his wife setting him the\r\n     example, died with these words, 'Pætus, it is not painful.' You\r\n     must know the story, and your observations upon it will oblige,\r\n\r\n  \"Sir,\r\n  Your most humble Servant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the worst man that ever lived in the world had the highest station\r\nin it, human life was the object of his diversion; and he sent orders\r\nfrequently, out of mere wantonness, to take off such-and-such, without\r\nso much as being angry with them. Nay, frequently his tyranny was so\r\nhumorous, that he put men to death because he could not but approve of\r\nthem. It came one day to his ear, that a certain married couple, Pætus\r\nand Arria, lived in a more happy tranquillity and mutual love than any\r\nother persons who were then in being. He listened with great attention\r\nto the account of their manner of spending their time together, of\r\nthe constant pleasure they were to each other in all their words and\r\nactions; and found by exact information, that they were so treasonable\r\nas to be much more happy than his Imperial Majesty himself. Upon which\r\nhe wrote Pætus the following billet:--\r\n\r\n     \"Pætus, you are hereby desired to despatch yourself. I have heard\r\n     a very good character of you; and therefore leave it to yourself,\r\n     whether you will die by dagger, sword, or poison. If you outlive\r\n     this order above an hour, I have given directions to put you to\r\n     death by torture.\r\n\r\n  NERO.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis familiar epistle was delivered to his wife Arria, who opened it.\r\n\r\nOne must have a soul very well turned for love, pity, and indignation,\r\nto comprehend the tumult this unhappy lady was thrown into upon this\r\noccasion. The passion of love is no more to be understood by some\r\ntempers than a problem in a science by an ignorant man: but he that\r\nknows what affection is, will have, upon considering the condition of\r\nArria, ten thousand thoughts flow in upon him, which the tongue was not\r\nformed to express. But the charming statue is now before my eyes, and\r\nArria, in her unutterable sorrow, has more beauty than ever appeared\r\nin youth, in mirth, or in triumph. These are the great and noble\r\nincidents which speak the dignity of our nature, in our sufferings\r\nand distresses. Behold her tender affection for her husband sinks her\r\nfeatures into a countenance which appears more helpless than that of an\r\ninfant: but, again, her indignation shows in her visage and her bosom a\r\nresentment as strong as that of the bravest man. Long she stood in this\r\nagony of alternate rage and love; but at last composed herself for her\r\ndissolution, rather than survive her beloved Pætus. When he came into\r\nher presence, he found her with the tyrant's letter in one hand, and a\r\ndagger in the other. Upon his approach to her, she gave him the order;\r\nand at the same time, stabbing herself, \"Pætus,\" said she, \"it is not\r\npainful,\" and expired. Pætus immediately followed her example. The\r\npassion of these memorable lovers was such, that it eluded the rigour\r\nof their fortune, and baffled the force of a blow, which neither felt,\r\nbecause each received it for the sake of the other. The woman's part in\r\nthis story is by much the more heroic, and has occasioned one of the\r\nbest epigrams transmitted to us from antiquity.\r\n\r\n    _When Arria pulled the dagger from her side,\r\n    Thus to her consort spoke the illustrious bride:\r\n    \"The wound I gave myself I do not grieve,\r\n    I die by that which Pætus must receive._\"[176]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Sept. 23._\r\n\r\nThe boy says, one in a black hat left the following letter:\r\n\r\n  \"FRIEND,\r\n\r\n  _19th of the 7th month._\r\n\r\n     \"Being of that part of Christians whom men call Quakers; and\r\n     being a seeker of the right way, I was persuaded yesterday to\r\n     hear one of your most noted teachers. The matter he treated was\r\n     the necessity of well-living, grounded upon a future state. I was\r\n     attentive; but the man did not appear in earnest. He read his\r\n     discourse (notwithstanding thy rebukes) so heavily, and with so\r\n     little air of being convinced himself, that I thought he would\r\n     have slept, as I observed many of his hearers did. I came home\r\n     unedified, and troubled in mind. I dipped into the Lamentations,\r\n     and from thence turning to the 34th chapter of Ezekiel, I found\r\n     these words: 'Woe be to the shepherds of Israel, that do feed\r\n     themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flock? Ye eat the\r\n     fat, and ye clothe you with the wool: ye kill them that are fed;\r\n     but ye feed not the flock. The diseased have ye not strengthened;\r\n     neither have ye healed that which was sick; neither have ye bound\r\n     up that which was broken; neither have ye brought again that which\r\n     was driven away; neither have ye sought that which was lost; but\r\n     with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them,' &c. Now I pray\r\n     thee, friend, as thou art a man skilled in many things, tell me,\r\n     who is meant by the diseased, the sick, the broken, the driven\r\n     away, and the lost? and whether the prophecy in this chapter be\r\n     accomplished, or yet to come to pass? And thou wilt oblige thy\r\n     friend, though unknown.\"\r\n\r\nThis matter is too sacred for this paper; but I can't see what injury\r\nit would do any clergyman, to have it in his eye, and believe, all that\r\nare taken from him by his want of industry, are to be demanded of him.\r\nI daresay, Favonius[177] has very few of these losses. Favonius, in the\r\nmidst of a thousand impertinent assailants of the divine truths, is an\r\nundisturbed defender of them. He protects all under his care, by the\r\nclearness of his understanding, and the example of his life: he visits\r\ndying men with the air of a man who hoped for his own dissolution, and\r\nenforces in others a contempt of this life, by his own expectation of\r\nthe next. His voice and behaviour are the lively images of a composed\r\nand well-governed zeal. None can leave him for the frivolous jargon\r\nuttered by the ordinary teachers among Dissenters, but such who cannot\r\ndistinguish vociferation from eloquence, and argument from railing.\r\nHe is so great a judge of mankind, and touches our passions with so\r\nsuperior a command, that he who deserts his congregation must be a\r\nstranger to the dictates of nature, as well as to those of grace.\r\n\r\nBut I must proceed to other matters, and resolve the questions of other\r\ninquirers; as in the following:\r\n\r\n  \"SIR,\r\n\r\n  _Heddington, Sept. 19._\r\n\r\n     \"Upon reading that part of the _Tatler_, No. 69, where mention is\r\n     made of a certain chapel-clerk, there arose a dispute, and that\r\n     produced a wager, whether by the words chapel-clerk was meant a\r\n     clergyman or a layman? By a clergyman, I mean one in holy orders.\r\n     It was not that anybody in the company pretended to guess who the\r\n     person was; but some asserted, that by Mr. Bickerstaff's words\r\n     must be meant a clergyman only: others said, that those words\r\n     might have been said of any clerk of a parish; and some of them\r\n     more properly, of a layman. The wager is half-a-dozen bottles of\r\n     wine; in which (if you please to determine it) your health, and\r\n     all the family of the staffs, shall certainly be drunk; and you\r\n     will singularly oblige another very considerable family. I mean\r\n     that of\r\n\r\n  \"Your humble Servants,\r\n  THE TRENCHER-CAPS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very customary with us learned men, to find perplexities where\r\nno one else can see any. The honest gentlemen who wrote me this, are\r\nmuch at a loss to understand what I thought very plain; and in return,\r\ntheir epistle is so plain that I can't understand it. This, perhaps, is\r\nat first a little like nonsense; but I desire all persons to examine\r\nthese writings with an eye to my being far gone in the occult sciences;\r\nand remember, that it is the privilege of the learned and the great to\r\nbe understood when they please: for as a man of much business may be\r\nallowed to leave company when he pleases; so one of high learning may\r\nbe above your capacity when he thinks fit. But without further speeches\r\nor fooling, I must inform my friends the Trencher-Caps in plain words,\r\nthat I meant in the place they speak of, a drunken clerk of a church:\r\nand I will return their civility among my relations, and drink their\r\nhealths as they do ours.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[176] Martial, \"Epig.,\" i. 14.

At the entrance\r\n     is hieroglyphically drawn, a cavalier contending with a monster,\r\n     with jaws expanded, just ready to devour him.[183]\r\n\r\n     \"Hither the brethren of the industry resort; but to avoid\r\n     ostentation, they wear no habits of distinction, and perform\r\n     their exercises with as little noise and show as possible. Here\r\n     are no undergraduates, but each is a master of his art. They are\r\n     distributed according to their various talents, and detached\r\n     abroad in parties, to divide the labours of the day. They have\r\n     dogs as well nosed and as fleet as any, and no sportsmen show\r\n     greater activity. Some beat for the game, some hunt it, others\r\n     come in at the death; and my honest landlord makes very good\r\n     venison sauce, and eats his share of the dinner.\r\n\r\n     \"I would fain pursue my metaphors; but a venerable person who\r\n     stands by me, and waits to bring you this letter, and whom, by a\r\n     certain benevolence in his look, I suspect to be Pacolet, reproves\r\n     me, and obliges me to write in plainer terms; that the society had\r\n     fixed their eyes on a gay young gentleman who has lately succeeded\r\n     to a title and an estate; the latter of which they judged would\r\n     be very convenient for them. Therefore, after several attempts to\r\n     get into his acquaintance, my landlord finds an opportunity to\r\n     make his court to a friend of the young spark's, in the following\r\n     manner:\r\n\r\n     \"'Sir, as I take you to be a lover of ingenuity and plain-dealing,\r\n     I shall speak very freely to you. In few words then, you are\r\n     acquainted with Sir Liberal Brisk. Providence has for our\r\n     emolument sent him a fair estate, for men are not born for\r\n     themselves. Therefore, if you'll bring him to my house, we will\r\n     take care of him, and you shall have half the profits. There's\r\n     Ace and Cutter will do his business to a hair.

Now if we can secure him to ourselves, we shall\r\n     disappoint all those rascals that don't deserve him. Nay, you\r\n     need not start at it, sir, it is for your own advantage. Besides,\r\n     Partridge has cast me his nativity, and I find by certain destiny,\r\n     his oaks must be felled.'\r\n\r\n     \"The gentleman to whom this honest proposal was made, made little\r\n     answer; but said he would consider of it, and immediately took\r\n     coach to find out the young baronet, and told him all that had\r\n     passed, together with the new salvo to satisfy a man's conscience\r\n     in sacrificing his friend. Sir Brisk was fired, swore a dozen\r\n     oaths, drew his sword, put it up again, called for his man, beat\r\n     him, and bade him fetch a coach. His friend asked him, what he\r\n     designed, and whither he was going? He answered, to find out the\r\n     villains and fight them. To which his friend agreed, and promised\r\n     to be his second, on condition he would first divide his estate to\r\n     them, and reserve only a proportion to himself, that so he might\r\n     have the justice of fighting his equals. His next resolution was\r\n     to play with them, and let them see he was not the bubble they\r\n     took him for. But he soon quitted that, and resolved at last to\r\n     tell Bickerstaff of them, and get them enrolled in the order of\r\n     the industry, with this caution to all young landed knights and\r\n     squires, that whenever they are drawn to play, they would consider\r\n     it as calling them down to a sentence already pronounced upon\r\n     them, and think of the sound of those words, 'His oaks must be\r\n     felled.'[185] I am,\r\n\r\n  \"Sir,\r\n  Your faithful, humble Servant,\r\n  WILL.

I have long\r\ntold them, that I will suffer no enormity to pass, without I have an\r\nunderstanding with the offenders by way of hush-money; and yet the\r\ncandidates at Queenhithe send all the town coals but me. All the public\r\npapers have had this advertisement:\r\n\r\n  _London, Sept. 22, 1709._\r\n\r\n  _To the Electors of an Alderman for the Ward of Queenhithe._[186]\r\n\r\n     \"Whereas an evil and pernicious custom has of late very much\r\n     prevailed at the election of aldermen for this city, by treating\r\n     at taverns and alehouses, thereby engaging many unwarily to give\r\n     their votes: which practice appearing to Sir Arthur de Bradly\r\n     to be of dangerous consequence to the freedom of elections,\r\n     he hath avoided the excess thereof. Nevertheless, to make an\r\n     acknowledgment to this ward for their intended favour, he hath\r\n     deposited in the hands of Mr.----, one of the present Common\r\n     Council, four hundred and fifty pounds, to be disposed of as\r\n     follows, provided the said Sir Arthur de Bradly be the alderman,\r\n     viz.\r\n\r\n     \"All such that shall poll for Sir Arthur de Bradly, shall have one\r\n     chaldron of good coals gratis.\r\n\r\n     \"And half a chaldron to every one that shall not poll against him.\r\n\r\n     \"And the remainder to be laid out in a clock, dial, or otherwise,\r\n     as the Common Council-men of the said ward shall think fit.\r\n\r\n     \"And if any person shall refuse to take the said coals to himself,\r\n     he may assign the same to any poor electors in the ward.\r\n\r\n     \"I do acknowledge to have received the said four hundred and fifty\r\n     pounds, for the purposes above mentioned, for which I have given a\r\n     receipt.\r\n\r\n  Witness,  J----s H----t,\r\n            J----y G----h,    J----n M----y.[187]\r\n            E----d D----s.\r\n\r\n     \"_N.B._--Whereas several persons have already engaged to poll\r\n     for Sir Humphry Greenhat, it is hereby further declared, that\r\n     every such person as doth poll for Sir Humphry Greenhat, and doth\r\n     also poll for Sir Arthur de Bradly, shall each of them receive a\r\n     chaldron of coals gratis, on the proviso above mentioned.\"\r\n\r\nThis is certainly the most plain dealing that ever was used, except\r\nthat the just quantity which an elector may drink without excess,\r\nand the difference between an acknowledgment and a bribe, wants\r\nexplanation. Another difficulty with me is, how a man who is bargained\r\nwith for a chaldron of coals for his vote, shall be said to have\r\nthat chaldron gratis? If my kinsman Greenhat had given me the least\r\nintimation of his design, I should have prevented his publishing\r\nnonsense; nor should any knight in England have put my relation at the\r\nbottom of the leaf as a postscript, when after all it appears Greenhat\r\nhas been the more popular man. There is here such open contradiction,\r\nand clumsy art to palliate the matter, and prove to the people, that\r\nthe freedom of election is safer when laid out in coals, than strong\r\ndrink, that I can turn this only to a religious use, and admire the\r\ndispensation of things; for if these fellows were as wise as they\r\nare rich, where would soon be our liberty? This reminds me of a\r\nmemorable speech[188] made to a city almost in the same latitude with\r\nWestminster. \"When I think of your wisdom, I admire your wealth; when I\r\nthink of your wealth, I admire your wisdom.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[178] Sir Humphry Monoux.

But to come a\r\n     little nearer, I observe you put yourself under a very severe\r\n     restriction, even the laying down the _Tatler_ for ever, if I can\r\n     give you an instance, 'wherein you have injured any good man, or\r\n     pointed at anything which is not the true object of raillery.'\r\n\r\n     \"I must confess, Mr. Bickerstaff, if the making a man guilty of\r\n     vices that would shame the gallows, be the best methods to point\r\n     at the true object of raillery, I have until this time been very\r\n     ignorant; but if it be so, I will venture to assert one thing, and\r\n     lay it down as a maxim, even to the Staffian race, viz., that that\r\n     method of pointing ought no more to be pursued, than those people\r\n     ought to cut your throat who suffer by it, because I take both\r\n     to be murder, and the law is not in every private man's hands to\r\n     execute: but indeed, sir, were you the only person would suffer by\r\n     the _Tatler's_ discontinuance, I have malice enough to punish you\r\n     in the manner you prescribe; but I am not so great an enemy to the\r\n     town or my own pleasures, as to wish it; nor that you would lay\r\n     aside lashing the reigning vices, so long as you keep to the true\r\n     spirit of satire, without descending to rake into characters below\r\n     its dignity; for as you well observe, 'there is something very\r\n     terrible in unjustly attacking men in a way that may prejudice\r\n     their honour or fortune;' and indeed, where crimes are enormous,\r\n     the delinquent deserves little pity, yet the reporter may deserve\r\n     less: and here I am naturally led to that celebrated author of\r\n     'The Whole Duty of Man,' who hath set this matter in a true light\r\n     in his treatise of 'The Government of the Tongue;'[191] where,\r\n     speaking of uncharitable truths, he says, a discovery of this kind\r\n     serves not to reclaim, but enrage the offender, and precipitate\r\n     him into further degrees of ill. Modesty and fear of shame is\r\n     one of those natural restraints, which the wisdom of heaven has\r\n     put upon mankind; and he that once stumbles, may yet by a check\r\n     of that bridle recover again: but when by a public detection\r\n     he is fallen under that infamy he feared, he will then be apt\r\n     to discard all caution, and to think he owes himself the utmost\r\n     pleasures of vice, as the price of his reputation. Nay, perhaps\r\n     he advances further, and sets up for a reversed sort of fame, by\r\n     being eminently wicked, and he who before was but a clandestine\r\n     disciple, becomes a doctor of impiety, &c. This sort of reasoning,\r\n     sir, most certainly induced our wise legislators very lately to\r\n     repeal that law which put the stamp of infamy in the face of\r\n     felons; therefore you had better give an act of oblivion to your\r\n     delinquents, at least for transportation, than continue to mark\r\n     them in so notorious a manner. I cannot but applaud your designed\r\n     attempt of raising merit from obscurity, celebrating virtue\r\n     in distress, and attacking vice in another method, by setting\r\n     innocence in a proper light. Your pursuing these noble themes,\r\n     will make a greater advance to the reformation you seem to aim\r\n     at, than the method you have hitherto taken, by putting mankind\r\n     beyond the power of retrieving themselves, or indeed to think it\r\n     possible. But if after all your endeavours in this new way, there\r\n     should then remain any hardened impenitents, you must even give\r\n     them up to the rigour of the law, as delinquents not within the\r\n     benefit of their clergy. Pardon me, good Mr. Bickerstaff, for\r\n     the tediousness of this epistle, and believe it is not from any\r\n     self-conviction I have taken up so much of your time, or my own;\r\n     but supposing you mean all your lucubrations should tend to the\r\n     good of mankind, I may the easier hope your pardon, being,\r\n\r\n  \"Sir,\r\n  Yours, &c.\"\r\n\r\n     #/\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grecian Coffee-house, Sept. 29._[192]\r\n\r\nThis evening I thought fit to notify to the literati of this house,\r\nand by that means to all the world, that on Saturday the 15th of\r\nOctober next ensuing, I design to fix my first table of fame;[193] and\r\ndesire that such as are acquainted with the characters of the twelve\r\nmost famous men that have ever appeared in the world, would send in\r\ntheir lists, or name any one man for that table, assigning also his\r\nplace at it before that time, upon pain of having such his man of\r\nfame postponed, or placed too high for ever. I shall not, upon any\r\napplication whatsoever, alter the place which upon that day I shall\r\ngive to any of these worthies. But whereas there are many who take upon\r\nthem to admire this hero, or that author, upon second-hand, I expect\r\neach subscriber should underwrite his reason for the place he allots\r\nhis candidate.\r\n\r\nThe thing is of the last consequence; for we are about settling the\r\ngreatest point that has ever been debated in any age, and I shall take\r\nprecautions accordingly. Let every man who votes consider, that he is\r\nnow going to give away that, for which the soldier gave up his rest,\r\nhis pleasure, and his life; the scholar resigned his whole series of\r\nthought, his midnight repose, and his morning slumbers. In a word, he\r\nis (as I may say) to be judge of that after-life, which noble spirits\r\nprefer to their very real being. I hope I shall be forgiven therefore,\r\nif I make some objections against their jury as they shall occur to\r\nme. The whole of the number by whom they are to be tried, are to be\r\nscholars. I am persuaded also, that Aristotle will be put up by all\r\nof that class of men. However, in behalf of others, such as wear the\r\nlivery of Aristotle, the two famous universities are called upon on\r\nthis occasion; but I except the men of Queen's, Exeter, and Jesus\r\nColleges,[194] in Oxford, who are not to be electors, because he shall\r\nnot be crowned from an implicit faith in his writings, but to receive\r\nhis honour from such judges as shall allow him to be censured. Upon\r\nthis election (as I was just now going to say) I banish all who think\r\nand speak after others to concern themselves in it. For which reason\r\nall illiterate distant admirers are forbidden to corrupt the voices,\r\nby sending, according to the new mode, any poor students coals and\r\ncandles for their votes[195] in behalf of such worthies as they pretend\r\nto esteem. All news-writers are also excluded, because they consider\r\nfame as it is a report which gives foundation to the filling up their\r\nrhapsodies, and not as it is the emanation or consequence of good and\r\nevil actions. These are excepted against as justly as butchers in case\r\nof life and death: their familiarity with the greatest names takes off\r\nthe delicacy of their regard, as dealing in blood makes the _lanii_\r\nless tender of spilling it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. James's Coffee-house, Sept. 28._\r\n\r\nLetters from Lisbon of the 25th inst., N. S., speak of a battle which\r\nhas been fought near the river Cinca, in which General Staremberg had\r\noverthrown the army of the Duke of Anjou. The persons who send this,\r\nexcuse their not giving particulars, because they believed an account\r\nmust have arrived here before we could hear from them. They had advices\r\nfrom different parts, which concurred in the circumstances of the\r\naction; after which the army of his Catholic Majesty advanced as far as\r\nFraga, and the enemy retired to Saragossa. There are reports that the\r\nDuke of Anjou was in the engagement; but letters of good authority say,\r\nthat prince was on the road towards the camp when he received the news\r\nof the defeat of his troops. We promise ourselves great consequences\r\nfrom such an advantage, obtained by so accomplished a general as\r\nStaremberg; who, among the men of this present age, is esteemed the\r\nthird in military fame and reputation.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[189] Henry Winstanley, son of Hamlet Winstanley, the projector and\r\nbuilder of Eddystone light-house, was designed for a painter, but\r\nbecame an engraver, and clerk of the works at Audley Inn in 1694, and\r\nNew-market in 1700. Walpole supposes that he learned in Italy the\r\ntricks and contrivances which amused the public at Piccadilly and\r\nLittlebury.\r\n\r\nWinstanley's mathematical water theatre stood at the lower end of\r\nPiccadilly, distinguishable by a windmill at the top. The exhibitions\r\nhere were diversified to suit the seasons and the company; and the\r\nprices, except that of the sixpenny gallery, varied accordingly.\r\nBoxes were from four shillings to half-a-crown, pit from three to\r\ntwo shillings, and a seat in the shilling gallery sometimes cost\r\neighteen-pence. The quantity of water used on extraordinary occasions\r\nwas from 300 to 800 tons. Winstanley had another house of this sort\r\nat Littlebury, in Essex, where there were similar exhibitions. On his\r\ndeath, his houses came into the possession of his widow, for whose\r\nbenefit they were shown in 1713.\r\n\r\nFrom contemporary advertisements we learn, that the mathematical barrel\r\nwas at times turned into a tavern, and supplied the company with\r\ndifferent sorts of wine, biscuits, spa-water, and cold tankards; it\r\nwas also converted into a coffee-house, and a flying cupid presented\r\ntea, coffee, and newspapers to the gentlemen; fruits, flowers, and\r\nsweetmeats to the ladies. In the month of May there was the addition\r\nof a May-pole and garland, a milkmaid, a fiddler, and syllabubs.\r\nSoft music was heard at a distance, or sirens sung on the rocks.\r\nAn advertisement in the _Daily Courant_ for Jan. 20, 1713, speaks\r\nof \"great additions, to the expense of 300 tons of water, and fire\r\nmingling with the water, and two flying boys, and a flaming torch with\r\nwater flowing out of the burning flame.\"\r\n\r\n[190] No. 71.\r\n\r\n[191] Published in 1674. \"The Whole Duty of Man\" has been attributed to\r\nvarious authors; but probably it was written by Richard Allestree.\r\n\r\n[192] This article is often ascribed to Swift; but looking to the date\r\nat the head of it, such a theory seems disproved by Steele's letter to\r\nSwift of October 8: \"I wonder you do not write sometimes to me\" (see\r\nnote to No. 81). The article cannot have been held over for any time\r\nby Steele, because of the allusions in it to the Queenhithe election;\r\nthis was a matter respecting which Steele had written in the preceding\r\nnumber, whereas Swift could not have heard of it in Dublin.\r\n\r\n[193] See Nos. 67, 81.\r\n\r\n[194] They were obliged by the statutes of these colleges to keep to\r\nAristotle for their texts (Nichols).\r\n\r\n[195] See the account of the Queenhithe election in No. 73.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 75. [STEELE and ADDISON.[196]\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, Sept. 29_, to _Saturday, Oct. 1, 1709_\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Sept. 30._\r\n\r\nI am called off from public dissertations by a domestic affair of great\r\nimportance, which is no less than the disposal of my sister Jenny for\r\nlife. The girl is a girl of great merit, and pleasing conversation;\r\nbut I being born of my father's first wife, and she of his third, she\r\nconverses with me rather like a daughter than a sister. I have indeed\r\ntold her, that if she kept her honour, and behaved herself in such\r\nmanner as became the Bickerstaffs, I would get her an agreeable man for\r\nher husband; which was a promise I made her after reading a passage in\r\nPliny's Epistles.[197] That polite author had been employed to find out\r\na consort for his friend's daughter, and gives the following character\r\nof the man he had pitched upon:\r\n\r\n\"Aciliano plurimum vigoris et industriæ quanqum in maxima verecundia:\r\nest illi facies liberalis, multo sanguine, multo rubore, suffusa: est\r\ningenua totius corporis pulchritudo, et quidum senatorius decor, quæ\r\nego nequaquam arbitror negligenda: debet enim hoc castitati puellarum\r\nquasi præmium dari.\"\r\n\r\n\"Acilianus (for that was the gentleman's name) is a man of\r\nextraordinary vigour and industry, accompanied with the greatest\r\nmodesty. He has very much of the gentleman, with a lively colour, and\r\nflush of health in his aspect. His whole person is finely turned,\r\nand speaks him a man of quality: which are qualifications that, I\r\nthink, ought by no means to be overlooked, and should be bestowed on a\r\ndaughter as the reward of her chastity.\"\r\n\r\nA woman that will give herself liberties, need not put her parents\r\nto so much trouble; for if she does not possess these ornaments in a\r\nhusband, she can supply herself elsewhere. But this is not the case\r\nof my sister Jenny, who, I may say without vanity, is as unspotted\r\na spinster as any in Great Britain. I shall take this occasion to\r\nrecommend the conduct of our own family in this particular.\r\n\r\nWe have in the genealogy of our house, the descriptions and pictures\r\nof our ancestors from the time of King Arthur; in whose days there was\r\none of my own name, a Knight of his Round Table, and known by the name\r\nof Sir Isaac Bickerstaff. He was low of stature, and of a very swarthy\r\ncomplexion, not unlike a Portuguese Jew. But he was more prudent than\r\nmen of that height usually are, and would often communicate to his\r\nfriends his design of lengthening and whitening his posterity. His\r\neldest son Ralph, for that was his name, was for this reason married to\r\na lady who had little else to recommend her, but that she was very tall\r\nand very fair. The issue of this match, with the help of high shoes,\r\nmade a tolerable figure in the next age; though the complexion of the\r\nfamily was obscure until the fourth generation from that marriage. From\r\nwhich time, till the reign of William the Conqueror, the females of\r\nour house were famous for their needlework and fine skins. In the male\r\nline, there happened an unlucky accident in the reign of Richard the\r\nThird; the eldest son of Philip, then chief of the family, being born\r\nwith an hump-back and very high nose. This was the more astonishing,\r\nbecause none of his forefathers ever had such a blemish; nor indeed was\r\nthere any in the neighbourhood of that make, except the butler, who was\r\nnoted for round shoulders, and a Roman nose: what made the nose the\r\nless excusable, was the remarkable smallness of his eyes.\r\n\r\nThese several defects were mended by succeeding matches; the eyes were\r\nopened in the next generation, and the hump fell in a century and a\r\nhalf; but the greatest difficulty was, how to reduce the nose; which\r\nI do not find was accomplished till about the middle of Henry the\r\nSeventh's reign, or rather the beginning of that of Henry the Eighth.\r\n\r\nBut while our ancestors were thus taken up in cultivating the eyes and\r\nnose, the face of the Bickerstaffs fell down insensibly into chin;\r\nwhich was not taken notice of (their thoughts being so much employed\r\nupon the more noble features) till it became almost too long to be\r\nremedied.\r\n\r\nBut length of time, and successive care in our alliances, have cured\r\nthis also, and reduced our faces into that tolerable oval which we\r\nenjoy at present. I would not be tedious in this discourse, but cannot\r\nbut observe, that our race suffered very much about three hundred years\r\nago, by the marriage of one of our heiresses with an eminent courtier,\r\nwho gave us spindle-shanks, and cramps in our bones, insomuch that we\r\ndid not recover our health and legs till Sir Walter Bickerstaff married\r\nMaud the milkmaid, of whom the then Garter King-at-arms (a facetious\r\nperson) said pleasantly enough, that she had spoiled our blood, but\r\nmended our constitutions. After this account of the effect our prudent\r\nchoice of matches has had upon our persons and features, I cannot\r\nbut observe, that there are daily instances of as great changes made\r\nby marriage upon men's minds and humours. One might wear any passion\r\nout of a family by culture, as skilful gardeners blot a colour out of\r\na tulip that hurts its beauty. One might produce an affable temper\r\nout of a shrew, by grafting the mild upon the choleric; or raise a\r\nJack-pudding from a prude, by inoculating mirth and melancholy. It\r\nis for want of care in the disposing of our children, with regard to\r\nour bodies and minds, that we go into a house and see such different\r\ncomplexions and humours in the same race and family. But to me it is\r\nas plain as a pikestaff, from what mixture it is, that this daughter\r\nsilently lowers, the other steals a kind look at you, a third is\r\nexactly well behaved, a fourth a splenetic, and a fifth a coquette. In\r\nthis disposal of my sister, I have chosen, with an eye to her being\r\na wit, and provided, that the bridegroom be a man of a sound and\r\nexcellent judgment, who will seldom mind what she says when she begins\r\nto harangue: for Jenny's only imperfection is an admiration of her\r\nparts, which inclines her to be a little, but a very little, sluttish;\r\nand you are ever to remark, that we are apt to cultivate most, and\r\nbring into observation, what we think most excellent in ourselves, or\r\nmost capable of improvement. Thus my sister, instead of consulting her\r\nglass and her toilet for an hour and a half after her private devotion,\r\nsits with her nose full of snuff,[198] and a man's nightcap on her\r\nhead, reading plays and romances. Her wit she thinks her distinction;\r\ntherefore knows nothing of the skill of dress, or making her person\r\nagreeable. It would make you laugh to see me often with my spectacles\r\non lacing her stays; for she is so very a wit, that she understands no\r\nordinary thing in the world. For this reason I have disposed of her to\r\na man of business, who will soon let her see, that to be well dressed,\r\nin good humour, and cheerful in the command of her family, are the arts\r\nand sciences of female life. I could have bestowed her upon a fine\r\ngentleman, who extremely admired her wit, and would have given her a\r\ncoach and six: but I found it absolutely necessary to cross the strain;\r\nfor had they met, they had eternally been rivals in discourse, and in\r\ncontinual contention for the superiority of understanding, and brought\r\nforth critics, pedants, or pretty good poets. As it is, I expect an\r\noffspring fit for the habitation of city, town, or country; creatures\r\nthat are docile and tractable in whatever we put them to. To convince\r\nmen of the necessity of taking this method, let but one, even below the\r\nskill of an astrologer, behold the turn of faces he meets as soon as he\r\npasses Cheapside Conduit, and you see a deep attention and a certain\r\nunthinking sharpness in every countenance. They look attentive, but\r\ntheir thoughts are engaged on mean purposes. To me it is very apparent\r\nwhen I see a citizen pass by, whether his head is upon woollen, silks,\r\niron, sugar, indigo, or stocks. Now this trace of thought appears or\r\nlies hid in the race for two or three generations. I know at this time\r\na person of a vast estate, who is the immediate descendant of a fine\r\ngentleman, but the great-grandson of a broker, in whom his ancestor is\r\nnow revived. He is a very honest gentleman in his principles, but can't\r\nfor his blood talk fairly: he is heartily sorry for it; but he cheats\r\nby constitution, and overreaches by instinct.\r\n\r\nThe happiness of the man who marries my sister will be, that he has\r\nno faults to correct in her but her own, a little bias of fancy, or\r\nparticularity of manners, which grew in herself, and can be amended by\r\nher. From such an untainted couple, we can hope to have our family rise\r\nto its ancient splendour of face, air, countenance, manner, and shape,\r\nwithout discovering the product of ten nations in one house. There is\r\nObadiah Greenhat says, he never comes into any company in England, but\r\nhe distinguishes the different nations of which we are composed: there\r\nis scarce such a living creature as a true Briton. We sit down indeed\r\nall friends, acquaintance, and neighbours; but after two bottles, you\r\nsee a Dane start up and swear, the kingdom is his own. A Saxon drinks\r\nup the whole quart, and swears, he'll dispute that with him. A Norman\r\ntells them both, he'll assert his liberty: and a Welshman cries, they\r\nare all foreigners and intruders of yesterday, and beats them out of\r\nthe room. Such accidents happen frequently among neighbours' children,\r\nand cousins-german. For which reason I say, study your race, or the\r\nsoil of your family will dwindle into cits or squires, or run up into\r\nwits or madmen[199].\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[196] In the list given by Steele to Tickell this paper was marked as\r\nwritten by Addison and Steele in conjunction.\r\n\r\n[197] Book i., Epist. xiv.\r\n\r\n[198] See No. 35.\r\n\r\n[199] \"In the _Tatler_, about the conduct of our family in their\r\nmarriages [_Tatler_, No. 75], put in where you think best: 'It is to\r\nbe noted, that the women of our family never change their name.'

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, Oct. 1_, to _Tuesday, Oct. 4, 1709_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, October 3._\r\n\r\nIt is a thing very much to be lamented, that a man must use a certain\r\ncunning to speak to people of what it is their interest to avoid. All\r\nmen will allow, that it is a great and heroic work to correct men's\r\nerrors, and at the price of being called a common enemy, to go on in\r\nbeing a common friend to my fellow-subjects and citizens. But I am\r\nforced in this work to revolve the same thing in ten thousand lights,\r\nand cast them in as many forms, to come at men's minds and affections,\r\nin order to lead the innocent in safety, as well as disappoint the\r\nartifices of betrayers. Since therefore I can make no impression upon\r\nthe offending side, I shall turn my observations upon the offended:\r\nthat is to say, I must whip my children for going into bad company,\r\ninstead of railing at bad company for ensnaring my children. The\r\ngreatest misfortunes men fall into, arise from themselves; and that\r\ntemper, which is called very often, though with great injustice,\r\ngood-nature, is the source of a numberless train of evils. For which\r\nreason we are to take this as a rule, that no action is commendable\r\nwhich is not voluntary; and we have made this a maxim--that man who\r\nis commonly called good-natured, is hardly to be thanked for anything\r\nhe does, because half that is acted about him, is done rather by his\r\nsufferance than approbation. It is generally a laziness of disposition,\r\nwhich chooses rather to let things pass the worst way, than to go\r\nthrough the pain of examination. It must be confessed, such a one has\r\nso great a benevolence in him, that he bears a thousand uneasinesses,\r\nrather than he will incommode others; nay, often when he has just\r\nreason to be offended, chooses to sit down with a small injury, than\r\nbring it into reprehension, out of pure compassion to the offender.\r\nSuch a person has it usually said of him, he is no man's enemy but\r\nhis own; which is in effect saying, he is a friend to every man but\r\nhimself and his friends: for by a natural consequence of his neglecting\r\nhimself, he either incapacitates himself to be another's friend, or\r\nmakes others cease to be his. If I take no care of my own affairs, no\r\nman that is my friend can take it ill if I am negligent also of his.\r\nThis soft disposition, if it continues uncorrected, throws men into a\r\nsea of difficulties. There is Euphusius, with all the good qualities in\r\nthe world, deserves well of nobody: that universal good-will which is\r\nso strong in him, exposes him to the assault of every invader upon his\r\ntime, his conversation, and his property. His diet is butcher's meat,\r\nhis wenches are in plain pinners and Norwich crapes,[200] his dress\r\nlike other people, his income great, and yet has he seldom a guinea at\r\ncommand. From these easy gentlemen, are collected estates by servants\r\nor gamesters; which latter fraternity are excusable, when we think of\r\nthis clan, who seem born to be their prey. All therefore of the family\r\nof Actæon[201] are to take notice, that they are hereby given up to\r\nthe brethren of the industry, with this reserve only, that they are to\r\nbe marked as stricken deer, not for their own sakes, but to preserve\r\nthe herd from following them and coming within the scent. I am obliged\r\nto leave this important subject, without telling whose quarters are\r\nsevered, who has the humbles, who the haunch, and who the legs, of the\r\nlast stag that was pulled down; but this is only deferred in hopes\r\nmy deer will make their escape without more admonitions or examples,\r\nof which they have had (in mine and the town's opinion) too great a\r\nplenty. I must, I say, at present go to other matters of moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_White's Chocolate-house, October 3._\r\n\r\nThe lady has answered the letter of Mr. Alexander Landlord, which was\r\npublished on Thursday last,[202] but in such a manner as I do not\r\nthink fit to proceed in the affair; for she has plainly told him, that\r\nlove is her design, but marriage her aversion. Bless me! What is this\r\nage come to, that people can think to make a pimp of an astronomer?\r\nI shall not promote such designs, but shall leave her to find out\r\nher admirer, while I speak to another case sent to me by a letter of\r\nSeptember 30, subscribed Lovewell Barebones, where the author desires\r\nme to suspend my care of the dead, till I have done something for the\r\ndying. His case is, that the lady he loves is ever accompanied by a\r\nkinswoman, one of those gay, cunning women, who prevent all the love\r\nwhich is not addressed to themselves. This creature takes upon her in\r\nhis mistress's presence to ask him, whether Mrs. Florimel (that is the\r\ncruel one's name) is not very handsome; upon which he looks silly;\r\nthen they both laugh out, and she will tell him, that Mrs. Florimel\r\nhad an equal passion for him, but desired him not to expect the first\r\ntime to be admitted in private; but that now he was at liberty before\r\nher only, who was her friend, to speak his mind, and that his mistress\r\nexpected it. Upon which Florimel acts a virgin-confusion, and with\r\nsome disorder waits his speech. Here ever follows a deep silence;\r\nafter which a loud laugh. Mr. Barebones applies himself to me on this\r\noccasion. All the advice I can give him is, to find a lover for the\r\nconfidant, for there is no other bribe will prevail; and I see by her\r\ncarriage, that it is no hard matter, for she is too gay to have a\r\nparticular passion, or to want a general one.\r\n\r\nSome days ago the town had a full charge laid against my Essays, and\r\nprinted at large. I altered not one word of what he of the contrary\r\nopinion said; but have blotted out some warm things said for me;\r\ntherefore please to hear the counsel for the defendant, though I shall\r\nbe so no otherwise than to take a middle way, and, if possible, keep\r\ncommendations from being insipid to men's taste, or raillery pernicious\r\nto their characters.\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n  _Sept. 30._\r\n\r\n     \"As I always looked upon satire as the best friend to reformation,\r\n     whilst its lashes were general, so that gentleman[203] must excuse\r\n     me, if I do not see the inconvenience of a method he is so much\r\n     concerned at. The errors he assigns in it, I think, are comprised\r\n     in the desperation men are generally driven to, when by a public\r\n     detection they fall under the infamy they feared, who otherwise,\r\n     by checking their bridle, might have recovered their stumble, and\r\n     through a self-conviction become their own reformers: so he that\r\n     was before but a clandestine disciple (to use his own quotation),\r\n     is now become a doctor in impiety, The little success that is to\r\n     be expected by these methods from a hardened offender, is too\r\n     evident to insist on; yet it is true, there is a great deal of\r\n     charity in this sort of reasoning, whilst the effects of those\r\n     crimes extend not beyond themselves. But what relation has this\r\n     to your proceedings? It is not a circumstantial guessing will\r\n     serve turn, for there are more than one to pretend to any of your\r\n     characters; but there must at least be something that must amount\r\n     to a nominal description, before even common fame can separate me\r\n     from the rest of mankind to dart at. A general representation of\r\n     an action, either ridiculous or enormous, may make those wince who\r\n     find too much similitude in the character with themselves to plead\r\n     not guilty; but none but a witness to the crime can charge them\r\n     with the guilt, whilst the indictment is general, and the offender\r\n     has the asylum of the whole world to protect him. Here can then\r\n     be no injustice, where no one is injured; for it is themselves\r\n     must appropriate the saddle, before scandal can ride them. Your\r\n     method then, in my opinion, is no way subject to the charge\r\n     brought against it; but on the contrary, I believe this advantage\r\n     is too often drawn from it, that whilst we laugh at, or detest the\r\n     uncertain subject of the satire, we often find something in the\r\n     error a parallel to ourselves; and being insensibly drawn to the\r\n     comparison we would get rid of, we plunge deeper into the mire,\r\n     and shame produces that which advice has been too weak for; and\r\n     you, sir, get converts you never thought of. As for descending to\r\n     characters below the dignity of satire, what men think are not\r\n     beneath commission, I must assure him, I think are not beneath\r\n     reproof: for as there is as much folly in a ridiculous deportment,\r\n     as there is enormity in a criminal one, so neither the one nor the\r\n     other ought to plead exemption. The kennel of curs are as much\r\n     enemies to the state, as Gregg[204] for his confederacy; for as\r\n     this betrayed our Government, so the other does our property,\r\n     and one without the other is equally useless. As for the act of\r\n     oblivion he so strenuously insists on, _Le Roi s'avisera_ is a\r\n     fashionable answer; and for his modus of panegyric, the hint was\r\n     unnecessary, where Virtue need never ask twice for her laurel.\r\n     But as for his reformation by opposites, I again must ask his\r\n     pardon, if I think the effects of these sort of reasonings (by\r\n     the paucity of converts) are too great an argument, both of their\r\n     imbecility and unsuccessfulness, to believe it will be any better\r\n     than misspending of time, by suspending a method that will turn\r\n     more to advantage, and which has no other danger of losing ground,\r\n     but by discontinuance. And as I am certain (of what he supposes)\r\n     that your lucubrations are intended for the public benefit, so I\r\n     hope you will not give them so great an interruption, by laying\r\n     aside the only method that can render you beneficial to mankind,\r\n     and (among others) agreeable to,\r\n\r\n  \"Sir,\r\n  Your humble Servant, &c.\"[205]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. James's Coffee-house, October 3._\r\n\r\nLetters from the camp at Havre on the 7th instant, N.S., advise, that\r\nthe trenches were opened before Mons on the 27th of last month, and the\r\napproaches were carried on at two attacks with great application and\r\nsuccess, notwithstanding the rains which had fallen; that the besiegers\r\nhad made themselves masters of several redoubts, and other outworks,\r\nand had advanced the approaches within ten paces of the counterscarps\r\nof the hornwork.

[STEELE.[206]\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, Oct. 4_, to _Thursday, Oct. 6, 1709_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, October 5._\r\n\r\nAs bad as the world is, I find by very strict observation upon virtue\r\nand vice, that if men appeared no worse than they really are, I should\r\nhave less work than at present I am obliged to undertake for their\r\nreformation.\r\n\r\nThey have generally taken up a kind of inverted ambition, and affect\r\neven faults and imperfections of which they are innocent. The other\r\nday in a coffee-house I stood by a young heir, with a fresh, sanguine,\r\nand healthy look, who entertained us with an account of his claps and\r\nhis diet-drink; though, to my knowledge, he is as sound as any of his\r\ntenants. This worthy youth put me into reflections upon that subject;\r\nand I observed the fantastical humour to be so general, that there is\r\nhardly a man who is not more or less tainted with it. The first of\r\nthis order of men are the valetudinarians, who are never in health,\r\nbut complain of want of stomach or rest every day till noon, and then\r\ndevour all which comes before them. Lady Dainty[207] is convinced, that\r\nit is necessary for a gentlewoman to be out of order; and to preserve\r\nthat character, she dines every day in her closet at twelve, that she\r\nmay become her table at two, and be unable to eat in public. About\r\nfive years ago, I remember it was the fashion to be short-sighted: a\r\nman would not own an acquaintance until he had first examined him with\r\nhis glass. At a lady's entrance into the play-house, you might see\r\ntubes immediately levelled at her from every quarter of the pit and\r\nside-boxes.[208] However, that mode of infirmity is out, and the age\r\nhas recovered its sight; but the blind seem to be succeeded by the\r\nlame, and a jaunty limp is the present beauty. I think I have formerly\r\nobserved, a cane is part of the dress of a prig, and always worn upon\r\na button, for fear he should be thought to have an occasion for it, or\r\nbe esteemed really, and not genteelly, a cripple. I have considered,\r\nbut could never find out the bottom of this vanity. I indeed have heard\r\nof a Gascon general, who, by the lucky grazing of a bullet on the roll\r\nof his stocking, took occasion to halt all his life after. But as for\r\nour peaceable cripples, I know no foundation for their behaviour,\r\nwithout it may be supposed that in this warlike age, some think a\r\ncane the next honour to a wooden leg. This sort of affectation I have\r\nknown run from one limb or member to another. Before the limpers came\r\nin, I remember a race of lispers, fine persons, who took an aversion\r\nto particular letters in our language: some never uttered the letter\r\nH; and others had as mortal an aversion for S. Others have had their\r\nfashionable defect in their ears, and would make you repeat all you\r\nsaid twice over. I know an ancient friend of mine, whose table is every\r\nday surrounded with flatterers, that makes use of this, sometimes as a\r\npiece of grandeur, and at others as an art, to make them repeat their\r\ncommendations. Such affectations have been indeed in the world in\r\nancient times; but they fell into them out of politic ends. Alexander\r\nthe Great had a wry neck, which made it the fashion in his court to\r\ncarry their heads on one side when they came into the presence. One\r\nwho thought to outshine the whole court, carried his head so very\r\ncomplaisantly, that this martial prince gave him so great a box on the\r\near as set all the heads of the court upright.\r\n\r\nThis humour takes place in our minds as well as bodies. I know at\r\nthis time a young gentleman, who talks atheistically all day in\r\ncoffee-houses, and in his degrees of understanding sets up for a\r\nfree-thinker; though it can be proved upon him, he says his prayers\r\nevery morning and evening. But this class of modern wits I shall\r\nreserve for a chapter by itself. Of the like turn are all your\r\nmarriage-haters, who rail at the noose, at the words, \"For ever and\r\naye,\" and are secretly pining for some young thing or other that makes\r\ntheir hearts ache by her refusal. The next to these, are those who\r\npretend to govern their wives, and boast how ill they use them; when\r\nat the same time, go to their houses, and you shall see them step as\r\nif they feared making a noise, and are as fond as an alderman. I don't\r\nknow, but sometimes these pretences may arise from a desire to conceal\r\na contrary defect than that they set up for. I remember, when I was a\r\nyoung fellow, we had a companion of a very fearful complexion, who,\r\nwhen we sat in to drink, would desire us to take his sword from him\r\nwhen he grew fuddled, for it was his misfortune to be quarrelsome.\r\nThere are many, many of these evils, which demand my observation; but\r\nbecause I have of late been thought somewhat too satirical, I shall\r\ngive them warning, and declare to the whole world, that they are not\r\ntrue, but false hypocrites; and make it out, that they are good men\r\nin their hearts. The motive of this monstrous affectation in the\r\nabove-mentioned, and the like particulars, I take to proceed from that\r\nnoble thirst of fame and reputation which is planted in the hearts\r\nof all men. As this produces elegant writings and gallant actions in\r\nmen of great abilities, it also brings forth spurious productions in\r\nmen who are not capable of distinguishing themselves by things which\r\nare really praiseworthy. As the desire of fame in men of true wit\r\nand gallantry shows itself in proper instances, the same desire in\r\nmen who have the ambition without proper faculties, runs wild, and\r\ndiscovers itself in a thousand extravagancies, by which they would\r\nsignalise themselves from others, and gain a set of admirers. When I\r\nwas a middle-aged man, there were many societies of ambitious young\r\nmen in England, who, in their pursuits after fame, were every night\r\nemployed in roasting porters, smoking cobblers, knocking down watchmen,\r\noverturning constables, breaking windows, blackening sign-posts,\r\nand the like immortal enterprises, that dispersed their reputation\r\nthroughout the whole kingdom. One could hardly find a knocker at a door\r\nin a whole street after a midnight expedition of these _beaux esprits_.\r\nI was lately very much surprised by an account of my maid, who entered\r\nmy bedchamber this morning in a very great fright, and told me, she was\r\nafraid my parlour was haunted; for that she had found several panes of\r\nmy windows broken, and the floor strewed with halfpence.[209] I have\r\nnot yet a full light into this new way, but am apt to think, that it is\r\na generous piece of wit that some of my contemporaries make use of, to\r\nbreak windows, and leave money to pay for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. James's Coffee-house, October 5._\r\n\r\nI have no manner of news, more than what the whole town had the other\r\nday; except that I have the original letter of the Mareschal Bouffiers\r\nto the French King, after the late battle in the woods, which I\r\ntranslate for the benefit of the English reader.\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"This is to let your Majesty understand, that, to your immortal\r\n     honour, and the destruction of the confederates, your troops\r\n     have lost another battle.

[STEELE.[211]\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, Oct. 6_, to _Saturday, Oct. 8, 1709_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, October 7._\r\n\r\nAs your painters, who deal in history-pieces, often entertain\r\nthemselves upon broken sketches, and smaller flourishes of the pencil;\r\nso I find some relief in striking out miscellaneous hints, and sudden\r\nstarts of fancy, without any order or connection, after having spent\r\nmyself on more regular and elaborate dissertations. I am at present\r\nin this easy state of mind, sat down to my scrutoire; where, for\r\nthe better disposition of my correspondence, I have writ upon every\r\ndrawer the proper title of its contents, as hypocrisy, dice, patches,\r\npolitics, love, duels, and so forth. My various advices are ranged\r\nunder such several heads, saving only that I have a particular box\r\nfor Pacolet, and another for Monoculus.[212] I cannot but observe,\r\nthat my duel-box, which is filled by the lettered men of honour, is\r\nso very ill-spelt, that it is hard to decipher their writings. My\r\nlove-box, though on a quite contrary subject, filled with the works\r\nof the fairest hands in Great Britain, is almost as unintelligible.\r\nThe private drawer, which is sacred to politics, has in it some of the\r\nmost refined panegyrics and satires that any age has produced. I have\r\nnow before me several recommendations for places at my table of fame:\r\nthree of them are of an extraordinary nature, in which I find I am\r\nmisunderstood, and shall therefore beg leave to produce them. They are\r\nfrom a Quaker, a courtier, and a citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"ISAAC,\r\n\r\n     \"Thy lucubrations, as thou lovest to call them, have been perused\r\n     by several of our friends, who have taken offence: forasmuch\r\n     as thou excludest out of the brotherhood all persons who are\r\n     praiseworthy for religion, we are afraid that thou wilt fill thy\r\n     table with none but heathens, and cannot hope to spy a brother\r\n     there; for there are none of us who can be placed among murdering\r\n     heroes, or ungodly wits; since we do not assail our enemies with\r\n     the arm of flesh, nor our gainsayers with the vanity of human\r\n     wisdom. If therefore thou wilt demean thyself on this occasion\r\n     with a right judgment, according to the gifts that are in thee, we\r\n     desire thou wilt place James Nayler[213] at the upper end of thy\r\n     table.\r\n\r\n     \"EZEKIEL STIFFRUMP.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to my good friend Ezekiel, I must stand to it, that I cannot\r\nbreak my rule for the sake of James Nayler; not knowing, whether\r\nAlexander the Great, who is a choleric hero, won't resent his sitting\r\nat the upper end of the table with his hat on.\r\n\r\nBut to my courtier:\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"I am surprised, that you lose your time in complimenting the\r\n     dead, when you may make your court to the living. Let me only tell\r\n     you in the ear, Alexander and Cæsar (as generous as they were\r\n     formerly) have not now a groat to dispose of. Fill your table with\r\n     good company: I know a person of quality that shall give you £100\r\n     for a place at it. Be secret, and be rich.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours,\r\n  You know my hand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis gentleman seems to have the true spirit, without the formality of\r\nan under courtier; therefore I shall be plain with him, and let him\r\nleave the name of his courtier, and £100 in Morphew's hands: if I can\r\ntake it, I will.\r\n\r\nMy citizen writes the following:\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. ISAAC BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n  \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"Your _Tatler_ of September 13,[214] am now reading, and in your\r\n     list of famous men, desire you not forget Alderman Whittington,\r\n     who began the world with a cat, and died worth three hundred\r\n     and fifty thousand pounds sterling, which he left to an only\r\n     daughter, three years after his Mayoralty. If you want any further\r\n     particulars of ditto Alderman, daughter, or cat, let me know, and\r\n     per first will advise the needful. Which concludes,\r\n\r\n  \"Your loving Friend,\r\n  LEMUEL LEDGER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall have all due regard to this gentleman's recommendation; but\r\ncannot forbear observing, how wonderfully this sort of style is adapted\r\nfor the despatch of business, by leaving out insignificant particles:\r\nbesides that, the dropping of the first person is an artful way to\r\ndisengage a man from the guilt of rash words or promises. But I am to\r\nconsider, that a citizen's reputation is credit, not fame; and am to\r\nleave these lofty subjects for a matter of private concern in the next\r\nletter before me.\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"I am just recovered out of a languishing sickness by the care\r\n     of Hippocrates,[215] who visited me throughout my whole illness,\r\n     and was so far from taking any fee, that he inquired into my\r\n     circumstances, and would have relieved me also that way, but I did\r\n     not want it. I know no method of thanking him, but recommending it\r\n     to you to celebrate so great humanity in the manner you think fit,\r\n     and to do it with the spirit and sentiments of a man just relieved\r\n     from grief, misery, and pain; to joy, satisfaction, and ease: in\r\n     which you will represent the grateful sense of\r\n\r\n  \"Your obedient Servant,\r\n  T. B.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI think the writer of this letter has put the matter in as good a\r\ndress as I can for him; yet I cannot but add my applause to what\r\nthis distressed man has said. There is not a more useful man in a\r\ncommonwealth than a good physician; and by consequence no worthier a\r\nperson than he that uses his skill with generosity, even to persons\r\nof condition, and compassion to those who are in want: which is the\r\nbehaviour of Hippocrates, who shows as much liberality in his practice,\r\nas he does wit in his conversation and skill in his profession. A\r\nwealthy doctor, who can help a poor man, and will not without a fee,\r\nhas less sense of humanity than a poor ruffian, who kills a rich man to\r\nsupply his necessities. It is something monstrous to consider a man of\r\na liberal education tearing out the bowels of a poor family, by taking\r\nfor a visit what would keep them a week. Hippocrates needs not the\r\ncomparison of such extortion to set off his generosity; but I mention\r\nhis generosity to add shame to such extortion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis is to give notice to all ingenious gentlemen in and about the\r\ncities of London and Westminster, who have a mind to be instructed in\r\nthe noble sciences of music, poetry, and politics, that they repair\r\nto the Smyrna Coffee-house[216] in Pall Mall, betwixt the hours of\r\neight and ten at night, where they may be instructed gratis, with\r\nelaborate essays by word of mouth on all or any of the above-mentioned\r\narts.

I shall therefore\r\ndesire for the future, that if any one returns me an answer to a\r\nletter, he will not tell me he has received the favour of my letter;\r\nbut if he does not think fit to say, he has received the honour of it,\r\nthat he tell me in plain English, he has received my letter of such a\r\ndate. I must likewise insist, that he would conclude with, \"I am with\r\ngreat respect,\" or plainly, \"I am,\" without further addition; and not\r\ninsult me, by an assurance of his being with \"great truth\" and \"esteem\"\r\nmy humble servant. There is likewise another mark of superiority which\r\nI cannot bear, and therefore must inform my correspondents, that I\r\ndiscard all \"faithful\" humble servants, and am resolved to read no\r\nletters that are not subscribed, \"Your most obedient,\" or \"most humble\r\nServant,\" or both. These may appear niceties to vulgar minds, but they\r\nare such as men of honour and distinction must have regard to.

When I had reprimanded him for the ardour wherein he\r\nexpressed himself, which I thought had not enough of that veneration\r\nwith which the marriage-bed is to be ascended, I told him, the day of\r\nhis nuptials should be on the Saturday following, which was the 8th\r\ninstant. On the 7th in the evening, poor Jenny came into my chamber,\r\nand having her heart full of the great change of life from a virgin\r\ncondition to that of a wife, she long sat silent. I saw she expected\r\nme to entertain her on this important subject, which was too delicate\r\na circumstance for herself to touch upon; whereupon I relieved her\r\nmodesty in the following manner: \"Sister,\" said I, \"you are now going\r\nfrom me; and be contented, that you leave the company of a talkative\r\nold man, for that of a sober young one: but take this along with you,\r\nthat there is no mean in the state you are entering into, but you\r\nare to be exquisitely happy or miserable, and your fortune in this\r\nway of life will be wholly of your own making. In all the marriages\r\nI have ever seen (most of which have been unhappy ones), the great\r\ncause of evil has proceeded from slight occasions; and I take it to\r\nbe the first maxim in a married condition, that you are to be above\r\ntrifles. When two persons have so good an opinion of each other as to\r\ncome together for life, they will not differ in matters of importance,\r\nbecause they think of each other with respect in regard to all things\r\nof consideration that may affect them, and are prepared for mutual\r\nassistance and relief in such occurrences; but for less occasions, they\r\nhave formed no resolutions, but leave their minds unprepared. This,\r\ndear Jenny, is the reason that the quarrel between Sir Harry Willit\r\nand his lady, which began about her squirrel, is irreconcilable: Sir\r\nHarry was reading a grave author; she runs into his study, and in a\r\nplaying humour, claps the squirrel upon the folio. He threw the animal\r\nin a rage on the floor; she snatches it up again, calls Sir Harry a\r\nsour pedant, without good nature or good manners. This cast him into\r\nsuch a rage, that he threw down the table before him, kicked the book\r\nround the room; then recollected himself: 'Lord, Madam,' said he, 'why\r\ndid you run into such expressions? I was,' said he, 'in the highest\r\ndelight with that author when you clapped your squirrel upon my book;'\r\nand smiling, added upon recollection, 'I have a great respect for your\r\nfavourite, and pray let us all be friends.' My lady was so far from\r\naccepting this apology, that she immediately conceived a resolution\r\nto keep him under for ever, and with a serious air replied, 'There is\r\nno regard to be had to what a man says, who can fall into so indecent\r\na rage, and such an abject submission, in the same moment, for which\r\nI absolutely despise you.' Upon which she rushed out of the room. Sir\r\nHarry stayed some minutes behind to think and command himself; after\r\nwhich he followed her into her bedchamber, where she was prostrate\r\nupon the bed, tearing her hair, and naming twenty coxcombs who would\r\nhave used her otherwise. This provoked him to so high a degree, that\r\nhe forbore nothing but beating her; and all the servants in the family\r\nwere at their several stations listening, while the best man and\r\nwoman, the best master and mistress, defamed each other in a way that\r\nis not to be repeated even at Billingsgate. You know this ended in an\r\nimmediate separation: she longs to return home, but knows not how to\r\ndo it: he invites her home every day, and lies with every woman he\r\ncan get. Her husband requires no submission of her; but she thinks\r\nher very return will argue she is to blame, which she is resolved to\r\nbe for ever, rather than acknowledge it. Thus, dear Jenny, my great\r\nadvice to you is, be guarded against giving or receiving little\r\nprovocations. Great matters of offence I have no reason to fear either\r\nfrom you or your husband.\" After this, we turned our discourse into a\r\nmore gay style, and parted: but before we did so, I made her resign\r\nher snuff-box[218] for ever, and half drown herself with washing away\r\nthe stench of the musty.[219] But the wedding morning arrived, and our\r\nfamily being very numerous, there was no avoiding the inconvenience\r\nof making the ceremony and festival more public than the modern way\r\nof celebrating them makes me approve of. The bride next morning came\r\nout of her chamber, dressed with all the art and care that Mrs. Toilet\r\nthe tire-woman could bestow on her. She was on her wedding-day three\r\nand twenty: her person is far from what we call a regular beauty;\r\nbut a certain sweetness in her countenance, an ease in her shape and\r\nmotion, with an unaffected modesty in her looks, had attractions beyond\r\nwhat symmetry and exactness can inspire without the addition of these\r\nendowments. When her lover entered the room, her features flushed\r\nwith shame and joy; and the ingenuous manner, so full of passion and\r\nof awe, with which Tranquillus approached to salute her, gave me good\r\nomens of his future behaviour towards her. The wedding was wholly under\r\nmy care. After the ceremony at church, I was resolved to entertain\r\nthe company with a dinner suitable to the occasion, and pitched upon\r\nthe Apollo,[220] at the Old Devil at Temple Bar, as a place sacred\r\nto mirth, tempered with discretion, where Ben Jonson and his \"sons\"\r\nused to make their liberal meetings. Here the chief of the Staffian\r\nrace appeared; and as soon as the company were come into that ample\r\nroom, Lepidus Wagstaff began to make me compliments for choosing that\r\nplace, and fell into a discourse upon the subject of pleasure and\r\nentertainment, drawn from the rules of Ben's Club,[221] which are in\r\ngold letters over the chimney. Lepidus has a way very uncommon, and\r\nspeaks on subjects, on which any man else would certainly offend, with\r\ngreat dexterity. He gave us a large account of the public meetings of\r\nall the well-turned minds who had passed through this life in ages\r\npast, and closed his pleasing narrative with a discourse on marriage,\r\nand a repetition of the following verses out of Milton:--\r\n\r\n    _Hail wedded love! mysterious law! true source\r\n    Of human offspring, sole propriety\r\n    In Paradise, of all things common else.\r\n    By thee adult'rous lust was driven from men\r\n    Among the bestial herds to range; by thee,\r\n    Founded in reason, loyal, just, and pure,\r\n    Relations dear, and all the charities\r\n    Of father, son, and brother, first were known,\r\n    Perpetual fountain of domestic sweets,\r\n    Whose bed is undefiled, and chaste pronounced,\r\n    Present or past, as saints or patriarchs used.\r\n    Here Love his golden shafts employs; here lights\r\n    His constant lamp, and waves his purple wings:\r\n    Reigns here, and revels not in the bought smile\r\n    Of harlots, loveless, joyless, unendeared,\r\n    Casual fruition; nor in court amours,\r\n    Mixed dance, or wanton mask, or midnight ball,\r\n    Or serenade, which the starved lover sings\r\n    To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain._[222]\r\n\r\nIn these verses, all the images that can come into a young woman's head\r\non such an occasion, are raised; but that in so chaste and elegant\r\na manner, that the bride thanked him for his agreeable talk, and we\r\nsat down to dinner. Among the rest of the company, there was got in a\r\nfellow you call a wag. This ingenious person is the usual life of all\r\nfeasts and merriments, by speaking absurdities, and putting everybody\r\nof breeding and modesty out of countenance. As soon as we sat down, he\r\ndrank to the bride's diversion that night, and then made twenty double\r\nmeanings on the word thing. We are the best bred family, for one so\r\nnumerous, in this kingdom; and indeed we should all of us have been as\r\nmuch out of countenance as the bride, but that we were relieved by an\r\nhonest rough relation of ours at the lower end of the table, who is a\r\nlieutenant of marines.\r\n\r\nThis soldier and sailor had good plain sense, and saw what was wrong\r\nas well as another; he had a way of looking at his plate, and speaking\r\naloud in an inward manner; and whenever the wag mentioned the word\r\n\"thing,\" or the words \"that same,\" the lieutenant in that voice cried,\r\n\"Knock him down.\" The merry man wondering, angry, and looking round,\r\nwas the diversion of the table. When he offered to recover, and say,\r\n\"To the bride's best thoughts,\" \"Knock him down,\" says the lieutenant,\r\nand so on. This silly humour diverted, and saved us from the fulsome\r\nentertainment of an ill-bred coxcomb, and the bride drank the\r\nlieutenant's health. We returned to my lodging, and Tranquillus led his\r\nwife to her apartment, without the ceremony of throwing the stocking,\r\nwhich generally costs two or three maidenheads without any ceremony at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[218] See No. 35.\r\n\r\n[219] See No. 27.\r\n\r\n[220] The great room in the Devil Tavern.\r\n\r\n[221] The \"Leges Convivales,\" printed in Jonson's \"Works,\" were\r\nengraved in gold on a wooden panel.\r\n\r\n[222] \"Paradise Lost,\" iv. 750.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 80.

In my own profession, which is mostly physic, authors\r\nshall be rated according to their language.

When I entered the room where she receives\r\n     company, they all stood up indeed; but they stood as if they were\r\n     to stare at, rather than to receive me. After a long pause, a\r\n     servant brought a round stool, on which I sat down at the lower\r\n     end of the room, in the presence of no less than twelve persons,\r\n     gentlemen and ladies, lolling in elbow-chairs. And to complete\r\n     my disgrace, my mistress was of the society. I tried to compose\r\n     myself in vain, not knowing how to dispose of either my legs or\r\n     arms, nor how to shape my countenance; the eyes of the whole room\r\n     being still upon me in a profound silence. My confusion at last\r\n     was so great, that without speaking, or being spoken to, I fled\r\n     for it, and left the assembly to treat me at their discretion. A\r\n     lecture from you upon these inhuman distinctions in a free nation,\r\n     will, I doubt not, prevent the like evils for the future, and\r\n     make it, as we say, as cheap sitting as standing. I am with the\r\n     greatest respect,\r\n\r\n  \"Sir,\r\n  Your most humble, and\r\n  Most obedient Servant,\r\n  J. R.\"\r\n\r\n     \"_P.S._--I had almost forgot to inform you, that a fair young\r\n     lady sat in an armless chair upon my right hand with manifest\r\n     discontent in her looks.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after the receipt of this epistle, I heard a very gentle knock\r\nat my door: my maid went down, and brought up word, that a tall,\r\nlean, black man, well dressed, who said he had not the honour to be\r\nacquainted with me, desired to be admitted. I bid her show him up, met\r\nhim at my chamber door, and then fell back a few paces. He approached\r\nme with great respect, and told me with a low voice, he was the\r\ngentleman that had been seated upon the round stool. I immediately\r\nrecollected that there was a joint-stool in my chamber, which I was\r\nafraid he might take for an instrument of distinction, and therefore\r\nwinked at my boy to carry it into my closet. I then took him by the\r\nhand, and led him to the upper end of my room, where I placed him in\r\nmy great elbow-chair; at the same time drawing another without arms\r\nto it, for myself to sit by him. I then asked him, at what time this\r\nmisfortune befell him? He answered, between the hours of seven and\r\neight in the evening. I further demanded of him, what he had eaten or\r\ndrunk that day? He replied, nothing but a dish of water-gruel, with a\r\nfew plums in it. In the next place I felt his pulse, which was very\r\nlow and languishing. These circumstances confirmed me in an opinion\r\nwhich I had entertained upon the first reading of his letter, that\r\nthe gentleman was far gone in the spleen. I therefore advised him to\r\nrise the next morning and plunge into the cold bath, there to remain\r\nunder water until he was almost drowned. This I ordered him to repeat\r\nsix days successively; and on the seventh, to repair at the wonted\r\nhour to my Lady Haughty's, and to acquaint me afterwards with what he\r\nshall meet with there; and particularly to tell me, whether he shall\r\nthink they stared upon him so much as the time before. The gentleman\r\nsmiled; and by his way of talking to me, showed himself a man of\r\nexcellent sense in all particulars, unless when a cane chair, a round\r\nor a joint stool, were spoken of. He opened his heart to me at the same\r\ntime concerning several other grievances; such as, being overlooked\r\nin public assemblies, having his bows unanswered, being helped last\r\nat table, and placed at the back part of a coach; with many other\r\ndistresses, which have withered his countenance, and worn him to a\r\nskeleton. Finding him a man of reason, I entered into the bottom of his\r\ndistemper. \"Sir,\" said I, \"there are more of your constitution in this\r\nisland of Great Britain than in any other part of the world; and I beg\r\nthe favour of you to tell me, whether you do not observe, that you meet\r\nwith most affronts in rainy days.\" He answered candidly, that he had\r\nlong observed, that people were less saucy in sunshine than in cloudy\r\nweather. Upon which I told him plainly, his distemper was the spleen;\r\nand that though the world was very ill-natured, it was not so bad as\r\nhe believed it. I further assured him, that his use of the cold bath,\r\nwith a course of steel which I should prescribe him, would certainly\r\ncure most of his acquaintance of their rudeness, ill-behaviour,\r\nand impertinence. My patient smiled, and promised to observe my\r\nprescriptions, not forgetting to give me an account of their operation.\r\nThis distemper being pretty epidemical, I shall, for the benefit of\r\nmankind, give the public an account of the progress I make in the cure\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, October 12._\r\n\r\nThe author of the following letter behaves himself so ingenuously, that\r\nI cannot defer answering him any longer.\r\n\r\n  \"HONOURED SIR,\r\n\r\n  _October 6._\r\n\r\n     \"I have lately contracted a very honest and undissembled\r\n     claudication in my left foot, which will be a double affliction to\r\n     me, if (according to your _Tatler_ of this day[224]) it must pass\r\n     upon the world for a piece of singularity and affectation.

The best and greatest actions have proceeded\r\nfrom the prospect of the one or the other of these; but my design is to\r\ntreat only of those who have chiefly proposed to themselves the latter\r\nas the principal reward of their labours. It was for this reason that I\r\nexcluded from my tables of fame all the great founders and votaries of\r\nreligion; and it is for this reason also that I am more than ordinarily\r\nanxious to do justice to the persons of whom I am now going to speak;\r\nfor since fame was the only end of all their enterprises and studies,\r\na man cannot be too scrupulous in allotting them their due proportion\r\nof it. It was this consideration which made me call the whole body of\r\nthe learned to my assistance; to many of whom I must own my obligations\r\nfor the catalogues of illustrious persons which they have sent me\r\nin upon this occasion. I yesterday employed the whole afternoon in\r\ncomparing them with each other; which made so strong an impression upon\r\nmy imagination, that they broke my sleep for the first part of the\r\nfollowing night, and at length threw me into a very agreeable vision,\r\nwhich I shall beg leave to describe in all its particulars.\r\n\r\nI dreamed that I was conveyed into a wide and boundless plain, that\r\nwas covered with prodigious multitudes of people, which no man could\r\nnumber. In the midst of it there stood a mountain, with its head above\r\nthe clouds. The sides were extremely steep, and of such a particular\r\nstructure, that no creature, which was not made in a human figure,\r\ncould possibly ascend it. On a sudden there was heard from the top\r\nof it a sound like that of a trumpet; but so exceeding sweet and\r\nharmonious, that it filled the hearts of those who heard it with\r\nraptures, and gave such high and delightful sensations, as seemed to\r\nanimate and raise human nature above itself. This made me very much\r\namazed to find so very few in that innumerable multitude who had ears\r\nfine enough to hear or relish this music with pleasure: but my wonder\r\nabated, when, upon looking round me, I saw most of them attentive to\r\nthree sirens clothed like goddesses, and distinguished by the names of\r\nSloth, Ignorance, and Pleasure. They were seated on three rocks, amidst\r\na beautiful variety of groves, meadows, and rivulets, that lay on the\r\nborders of the mountain. While the base and grovelling multitude of\r\ndifferent nations, ranks, and ages were listening to these delusive\r\ndeities, those of a more erect aspect and exalted spirit separated\r\nthemselves from the rest, and marched in great bodies towards the\r\nmountain; from whence they heard the sound, which still grew sweeter\r\nthe more they listened to it.\r\n\r\nOn a sudden, methought this select band sprang forward with a\r\nresolution to climb the ascent, and follow the call of that heavenly\r\nmusic. Every one took something with him that he thought might be of\r\nassistance to him in his march. Several had their swords drawn, some\r\ncarried rolls of paper in their hands, some had compasses, others\r\nquadrants, others telescopes, and others pencils; some had laurels on\r\ntheir heads, and others buskins on their legs: in short, there was\r\nscarce any instrument of a mechanic art or liberal science which was\r\nnot made use of on this occasion. My good demon, who stood at my right\r\nhand during the course of this whole vision, observing in me a burning\r\ndesire to join that glorious company, told me, he highly approved\r\nthat generous ardour with which I seemed transported; but at the same\r\ntime advised me to cover my face with a mask all the while I was to\r\nlabour on the ascent. I took his counsel without inquiring into his\r\nreasons. The whole body now broke into different parties, and began\r\nto climb the precipice by ten thousand different paths. Several got\r\ninto little alleys, which did not reach far up the hill, before they\r\nended and led no farther; and I observed, that most of the artisans,\r\nwhich considerably diminished our number, fell into these paths. We\r\nleft another considerable body of adventurers behind us, who thought\r\nthey had discovered byways up the hill, which proved so very intricate\r\nand perplexed, that after having advanced in them a little, they were\r\nquite lost among the several turns and windings; and though they were\r\nas active as any in their motions, they made but little progress in the\r\nascent. These, as my guide informed me, were men of subtle tempers,\r\nand puzzled politics, who would supply the place of real wisdom with\r\ncunning and artifice. Among those who were far advanced in their way,\r\nthere were some that by one false step fell backward, and lost more\r\nground in a moment than they had gained for many hours, or could be\r\never able to recover. We were now advanced very high, and observed,\r\nthat all the different paths which ran about the sides of the mountain,\r\nbegan to meet in two great roads, which insensibly gathered the whole\r\nmultitude of travellers into two great bodies. At a little distance\r\nfrom the entrance of each road, there stood a hideous phantom, that\r\nopposed our farther passage. One of these apparitions had his right\r\nhand filled with darts, which he brandished in the face of all who came\r\nup that way. Crowds ran back at the appearance of it, and cried out,\r\n\"Death.\" The spectre that guarded the other road was Envy: she was not\r\narmed with weapons of destruction like the former; but by dreadful\r\nhissings, noises of reproach, and a horrid distracted laughter; she\r\nappeared more frightful than Death itself, insomuch that abundance\r\nof our company were discouraged from passing any farther, and some\r\nappeared ashamed of having come so far. As for myself, I must confess\r\nmy heart shrunk within me at the sight of these ghastly appearances:\r\nbut on a sudden, the voice of the trumpet came more full upon us, so\r\nthat we felt a new resolution reviving in us; and in proportion as this\r\nresolution grew, the terrors before us seemed to vanish. Most of the\r\ncompany who had swords in their hands, marched on with great spirit,\r\nand an air of defiance, up the road that was commanded by Death; while\r\nothers, who had thought and contemplation in their looks, went forward\r\nin a more composed manner up the road possessed by Envy. The way above\r\nthese apparitions grew smooth and uniform, and was so delightful, that\r\nthe travellers went on with pleasure, and in a little time arrived at\r\nthe top of the mountain. They here began to breathe a delicious kind of\r\nether, and saw all the fields about them covered with a kind of purple\r\nlight, that made them reflect with satisfaction on their past toils,\r\nand diffused a secret joy through the whole assembly, which showed\r\nitself in every look and feature. In the midst of these happy fields,\r\nthere stood a palace of a very glorious structure: it had four great\r\nfolding-doors, that faced the four several quarters of the world. On\r\nthe top of it was enthroned the goddess of the mountain, who smiled\r\nupon her votaries, and sounded the silver trumpet which had called\r\nthem up, and cheered them in their passage to her palace. They had now\r\nformed themselves into several divisions, a band of historians taking\r\ntheir stations at each door, according to the persons whom they were to\r\nintroduce.\r\n\r\nOn a sudden the trumpet, which had hitherto sounded only a march, or a\r\npoint of war, now swelled all its notes into triumph and exultation:\r\nthe whole fabric shook, and the doors flew open. The first who\r\nstepped forward was a beautiful and blooming hero, and, as I heard\r\nby the murmurs round me, Alexander the Great. He was conducted by a\r\ncrowd of historians. The person who immediately walked before him, was\r\nremarkable for an embroidered garment, who not being well acquainted\r\nwith the place, was conducting him to an apartment appointed for the\r\nreception of fabulous heroes. The name of this false guide was Quintus\r\nCurtius. But Arrian and Plutarch, who knew better the avenues of this\r\npalace, conducted him into the great hall, and placed him at the upper\r\nend of the first table. My good demon, that I might see the whole\r\nceremony, conveyed me to a corner of this room, where I might perceive\r\nall that passed without being seen myself. The next who entered was a\r\ncharming virgin, leading in a venerable old man that was blind. Under\r\nher left arm she bore a harp, and on her head a garland. Alexander,\r\nwho was very well acquainted with Homer, stood up at his entrance,\r\nand placed him on his right hand. The virgin, who it seems was one of\r\nthe nine sisters that attended on the goddess of Fame, smiled with an\r\nineffable grace at their meeting, and retired. Julius Cæsar was now\r\ncoming forward; and though most of the historians offered their service\r\nto introduce him, he left them at the door, and would have no conductor\r\nbut himself. The next who advanced, was a man of a homely but cheerful\r\naspect, and attended by persons of greater figure than any that\r\nappeared on this occasion. Plato was on his right hand, and Xenophon on\r\nhis left. He bowed to Homer, and sat down by him. It was expected that\r\nPlato would himself have taken a place next to his master Socrates; but\r\non a sudden there was heard a great clamour of disputants at the door,\r\nwho appeared with Aristotle at the head of them. That philosopher, with\r\nsome rudeness, but great strength of reason, convinced the whole table,\r\nthat a title to the fifth place was his due, and took it accordingly.\r\nHe had scarce sat down, when the same beautiful virgin that had\r\nintroduced Homer brought in another, who hung back at the entrance, and\r\nwould have excused himself, had not his modesty been overcome by the\r\ninvitation of all who sat at the table. His guide and behaviour made\r\nme easily conclude it was Virgil. Cicero next appeared, and took his\r\nplace. He had inquired at the door for one Lucceius to introduce him;\r\nbut not finding him there, he contented himself with the attendance of\r\nmany other writers, who all (except Sallust) appeared highly pleased\r\nwith the office.\r\n\r\nWe waited some time in expectation of the next worthy, who came in with\r\na great retinue of historians, whose names I could not learn, most of\r\nthem being natives of Carthage. The person thus conducted, who was\r\nHannibal, seemed much disturbed, and could not forbear complaining to\r\nthe Board of the affronts he had met with among the Roman historians,\r\n\"who attempted,\" says he, \"to carry me into the subterraneous\r\napartment; and perhaps would have done it, had it not been for the\r\nimpartiality of this gentleman,\" pointing to Polybius, \"who was the\r\nonly person, except my own countrymen, that was willing to conduct me\r\nhither.\" The Carthaginian took his seat, and Pompey entered with great\r\ndignity in his own person, and preceded by several historians. Lucan\r\nthe poet was at the head of them, who observing Homer and Virgil at\r\nthe table, was going to sit down himself, had not the latter whispered\r\nhim, that whatever pretence he might otherwise have had, he forfeited\r\nhis claim to it, by coming in as one of the historians. Lucan was so\r\nexasperated with the repulse, that he muttered something to himself,\r\nand was heard to say, that since he could not have a seat among them\r\nhimself, he would bring in one who alone had more merit than their\r\nwhole assembly: upon which he went to the door, and brought in Cato of\r\nUtica. That great man approached the company with such an air, that\r\nshowed he contemned the honour which he laid a claim to. Observing the\r\nseat opposite to Cæsar was vacant, he took possession of it, and spoke\r\ntwo or three smart sentences upon the nature of precedency, which,\r\naccording to him, consisted not in place, but in intrinsic merit; to\r\nwhich he added, that the most virtuous man, wherever he was seated, was\r\nalways at the upper end of the table. Socrates, who had a great spirit\r\nof raillery with his wisdom, could not forbear smiling at a virtue\r\nwhich took so little pains to make itself agreeable. Cicero took the\r\noccasion to make a long discourse in praise of Cato, which he uttered\r\nwith much vehemence. Cæsar answered him with a great deal of seeming\r\ntemper: but as I stood at a great distance from them, I was not able to\r\nhear one word of what they said. But I could not forbear taking notice,\r\nthat in all the discourse which passed at the table, a word or nod from\r\nHomer decided the controversy. After a short pause, Augustus appeared,\r\nlooking round him with a serene and affable countenance upon all the\r\nwriters of his age, who strove among themselves which of them should\r\nshow him the greatest marks of gratitude and respect. Virgil rose from\r\nthe table to meet him; and though he was an acceptable guest to all,\r\nhe appeared more such to the learned than the military worthies. The\r\nnext man astonished the whole table with his appearance: he was slow,\r\nsolemn, and silent in his behaviour, and wore a raiment curiously\r\nwrought with hieroglyphics. As he came into the middle of the room, he\r\nthrew back the skirt of it, and discovered a golden thigh. Socrates, at\r\nthe sight of it, declared against keeping company with any who were not\r\nmade of flesh and blood; and therefore desired Diogenes the Laertian to\r\nlead him to the apartment allotted for fabulous heroes, and worthies\r\nof dubious existence. At his going out, he told them, that they did\r\nnot know whom they dismissed; that he was now Pythagoras, the first of\r\nphilosophers, and that formerly he had been a very brave man at the\r\nsiege of Troy. \"That may be very true,\" said Socrates; \"but you forget\r\nthat you have likewise been a very great harlot in your time.\"[226]\r\nThis exclusion made way for Archimedes, who came forward with a scheme\r\nof mathematical figures in his hand; among which, I observed a cone and\r\na cylinder.[227]\r\n\r\nSeeing this table full, I desired my guide for variety to lead me to\r\nthe fabulous apartment, the roof of which was painted with gorgons,\r\nchimeras, and centaurs, with many other emblematical figures, which\r\nI wanted both time and skill to unriddle. The first table was almost\r\nfull. At the upper end sat Hercules, leaning an arm upon his club. On\r\nhis right hand were Achilles and Ulysses, and between them Æneas. On\r\nhis left were Hector, Theseus, and Jason. The lower end had Orpheus,\r\nÆsop, Phalaris,[228] and Musæus. The ushers seemed at a loss for a\r\ntwelfth man, when, methought, to my great joy and surprise, I heard\r\nsome at the lower end of the table mention Isaac Bickerstaff: but\r\nthose of the upper end received it with disdain, and said, if they\r\nmust have a British worthy, they would have Robin Hood. While I was\r\ntransported with the honour that was done me, and burning with envy\r\nagainst my competitor, I was awakened by the noise of the cannon\r\nwhich were then fired for the taking of Mons.[229] I should have been\r\nvery much troubled at being thrown out of so pleasing a vision on any\r\nother occasion; but thought it an agreeable change to have my thoughts\r\ndiverted from the greatest among the dead and fabulous heroes, to the\r\nmost famous among the real and the living.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[225] In the list which he gave to Tickell, Steele describes this\r\npaper as written by Addison and himself jointly. Hawkesworth claimed\r\nfor Swift Nos. 66, 67, 74, and 81, and no doubt the idea of \"tables\r\nof fame\" (No. 67) was started by him. On October 8, Steele wrote to\r\nSwift: \"I wonder you do not write sometimes to me. The town is in\r\ngreat expectation from Bickerstaff; what passed at the election for\r\nthe first table being to be published this day seven-night. I have not\r\nseen Ben Tooke a great while, but long to usher you and yours into the\r\nworld.\" But it seems clear that Swift left his friends to carry out\r\nthe execution of the plan. As Nichols points out, Swift afterwards\r\nwrote: \"I was told that Brutus, and his ancestor Junius, Socrates,\r\nEpaminondas, Cato the younger, and Sir Thomas More, were perpetually\r\ntogether: a sextumvirate, to which all the ages of the world cannot add\r\na seventh.\" Now there are only _two_ of this sextumvirate admitted to\r\nseats at the first \"table of fame\" in the _Tatler_. There are besides,\r\nin this paper, manifest deviations from the plan proposed in No. 67,\r\nand palpable contradictions to it. The \"side-table\" is here forgotten;\r\nthe heroes of \"great fame but dubious existence\" are turned into a\r\nseparate apartment; the number of the company at the second table is\r\nreduced from twenty to twelve; Bickerstaff, who \"had not been dead an\r\nhundred years,\" is mentioned to make out the dozen; of the third table\r\nthere is nothing said; and the subject seems finally discussed in one\r\npaper, which was evidently intended to have made three.\r\n\r\n[226] The annotators of the 1786 edition devoted a very long note to\r\nthe defence of Pythagoras against what is here said of him. As to his\r\n\"harlotry,\" he clearly could not be responsible for the metamorphoses\r\nof his soul after death. His soul continued, it was said, to shift its\r\nhabitations; and Dicearchus, almost a whole century after the death\r\nof Socrates, related, that on its third removal, it got into the body\r\nof Alce, a beautiful courtesan. (Aul. Gell., \"Noct. Att.,\" IV. xi.)\r\nLucian, long after, taking a century posterior to Pythagoras, makes his\r\nsoul animate the body of Aspasia, the mistress of Pericles.\r\n\r\n[227] Archimedes ordered a sphere included in a cylinder, the diagram\r\nof his thirty-second proposition, to be erected upon his tomb. This\r\nfigure was accordingly carved upon a stone near one of the gates\r\nof Syracuse, and became the means of enabling Cicero to discover\r\nthe sepulchre of Archimedes, covered over with brambles and thorns.\r\n(Cicero, \"Disp. Tusc.,\" v. 23.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 82.

MAX.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, October 17._\r\n\r\nAfter the mind has been employed on contemplations suitable to its\r\ngreatness, it is unnatural to run into sudden mirth or levity; but\r\nwe must let the soul subside as it rose, by proper degrees. My late\r\nconsiderations of the ancient heroes impressed a certain gravity upon\r\nmy mind, which is much above the little gratification received from\r\nstarts of humour and fancy, and threw me into a pleasing sadness. In\r\nthis state of thought I have been looking at the fire, and in a pensive\r\nmanner reflecting upon the great misfortunes and calamities incident\r\nto human life; among which, there are none that touch so sensibly, as\r\nthose which befall persons who eminently love, and meet with fatal\r\ninterruptions of their happiness when they least expect it. The piety\r\nof children to parents, and the affection of parents to their children,\r\nare the effects of instinct; but the affection between lovers and\r\nfriends is founded on reason and choice, which has always made me\r\nthink, the sorrows of the latter much more to be pitied than those of\r\nthe former. The contemplation of distresses of this sort softens the\r\nmind of man, and makes the heart better. It extinguishes the seeds of\r\nenvy and ill-will towards mankind, corrects the pride of prosperity,\r\nand beats down all that fierceness and insolence which are apt to get\r\ninto the minds of the daring and fortunate. For this reason the wise\r\nAthenians, in their theatrical performances, laid before the eyes of\r\nthe people the greatest afflictions which could befall human life,\r\nand insensibly polished their tempers by such representations. Among\r\nthe modern, indeed there has arisen a chimerical method of disposing\r\nthe fortune of the persons represented, according to what they call\r\npoetical justice; and letting none be unhappy, but those who deserve\r\nit. In such cases, an intelligent spectator, if he is concerned, knows\r\nhe ought not to be so; and can learn nothing from such a tenderness,\r\nbut that he is a weak creature, whose passions cannot follow the\r\ndictates of his understanding. It is very natural, when one is got into\r\nsuch a way of thinking, to recollect those examples of sorrow which\r\nhave made the strongest impression upon our imaginations. An instance\r\nor two of such you will give me leave to communicate.\r\n\r\nA young gentleman and lady of ancient and honourable houses in Cornwall\r\nhad from their childhood entertained for each other a generous and\r\nnoble passion, which had been long opposed by their friends, by reason\r\nof the inequality of their fortunes; but their constancy to each other,\r\nand obedience to those on whom they depended, wrought so much upon\r\ntheir relations, that these celebrated lovers were at length joined in\r\nmarriage. Soon after their nuptials, the bridegroom was obliged to go\r\ninto a foreign country, to take care of a considerable fortune which\r\nwas left him by a relation, and came very opportunely to improve their\r\nmoderate circumstances. They received the congratulations of all the\r\ncountry on this occasion; and I remember it was a common sentence in\r\nevery one's mouth, \"You see how faithful love is rewarded.\"\r\n\r\nHe took this agreeable voyage, and sent home every post fresh accounts\r\nof his success in his affairs abroad; but at last (though he designed\r\nto return with the next ship) he lamented in his letters, that business\r\nwould detain him some time longer from home, because he would give\r\nhimself the pleasure of an unexpected arrival.\r\n\r\nThe young lady, after the heat of the day, walked every evening on the\r\nseashore, near which she lived, with a familiar friend, her husband's\r\nkinswoman, and diverted herself with what objects they met there, or\r\nupon discourses of the future methods of life in the happy change of\r\ntheir circumstances. They stood one evening on the shore together in a\r\nperfect tranquillity, observing the setting of the sun, the calm face\r\nof the deep, and the silent heaving of the waves, which gently rolled\r\ntowards them, and broke at their feet; when at a distance her kinswoman\r\nsaw something float on the waters, which she fancied was a chest; and\r\nwith a smile told her, she saw it first, and if it came ashore full of\r\njewels, she had a right to it. They both fixed their eyes upon it, and\r\nentertained themselves with the subject of the wreck, the cousin still\r\nasserting her right; but promising, if it was a prize, to give her a\r\nvery rich coral for the child of which she was then big, provided she\r\nmight be god-mother. Their mirth soon abated, when they observed upon\r\nthe nearer approach, that it was a human body. The young lady, who had\r\na heart naturally filled with pity and compassion, made many melancholy\r\nreflections on the occasion. \"Who knows,\" said she, \"but this man may\r\nbe the only hope and heir of a wealthy house; the darling of indulgent\r\nparents, who are now in impertinent mirth, and pleasing themselves\r\nwith the thoughts of offering him a bride they have got ready for him?\r\nOr may he not be the master of a family that wholly depended upon\r\nhis life? There may, for aught we know, be half-a-dozen fatherless\r\nchildren, and a tender wife, now exposed to poverty by his death. What\r\npleasure might he have promised himself in the different welcome he was\r\nto have from her and them? But let us go away, it is a dreadful sight!\r\nThe best office we can do, is to take care that the poor man, whoever\r\nhe is, may be decently buried.\" She turned away, when a wave threw the\r\ncarcass on the shore. The kinswoman immediately shrieked out, \"Oh, my\r\ncousin!\" and fell upon the ground. The unhappy wife went to help her\r\nfriend, when she saw her own husband at her feet, and dropped in a\r\nswoon upon the body. An old woman, who had been the gentleman's nurse,\r\ncame out about this time to call the ladies in to supper, and found her\r\nchild (as she always called him) dead on the shore, her mistress and\r\nkinswoman both lying dead by him. Her loud lamentations, and calling\r\nher young master to life, soon awaked the friend from her trance; but\r\nthe wife was gone for ever.\r\n\r\nWhen the family and neighbourhood got together round the bodies, no one\r\nasked any question, but the objects before them told the story.[230]\r\n\r\nIncidents of this nature are the more moving when they are drawn by\r\npersons concerned in the catastrophe, notwithstanding they are often\r\noppressed beyond the power of giving them in a distinct light, except\r\nwe gather their sorrow from their inability to speak it. I have\r\ntwo original letters written both on the same day, which are to me\r\nexquisite in their different kinds. The occasion was this: a young\r\ngentleman who had courted a most agreeable young woman, and won her\r\nheart, obtained also the consent of her father, to whom she was an only\r\nchild. The old man had a fancy that they should be married in the same\r\nchurch where he himself was, in a village in Westmorland, and made them\r\nset out while he was laid up with the gout at London. The bridegroom\r\ntook only his man, the bride her maid. They had the most agreeable\r\njourney imaginable to the place of marriage: from whence the bridegroom\r\nwrote the following letter to his wife's father:--\r\n\r\n  \"SIR,\r\n\r\n  _March 18, 1672._\r\n\r\n     \"After a very pleasant journey hither, we are preparing for the\r\n     happy hour in which I am to be your son. I assure you the bride\r\n     carries it, in the eye of the vicar who married you, much beyond\r\n     her mother; though he says, your open sleeves, pantaloons, and\r\n     shoulder-knot made a much better show than the finical dress I am\r\n     in. However, I am contented to be the second fine man this village\r\n     ever saw, and shall make it very merry before night, because I\r\n     shall write myself from thence,\r\n\r\n  \"Your most dutiful Son,\r\n  T. D.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The bride gives her duty, and is as handsome as an angel--I am\r\n     the happiest man breathing.\"\r\n\r\nThe villagers were assembling about the church, and the happy couple\r\ntook a walk in a private garden. The bridegroom's man knew his master\r\nwould leave the place on a sudden after the wedding, and seeing him\r\ndraw his pistols the night before, took this opportunity to go into\r\nhis chamber and charge them. Upon their return from the garden, they\r\nwent into that room; and after a little fond raillery on the subject\r\nof their courtship, the lover took up a pistol which he knew he had\r\nunloaded the night before, and presenting it to her, said with the most\r\ngraceful air, whilst she looked pleased at his agreeable flattery,\r\n\"Now, madam, repent of all those cruelties you have been guilty of to\r\nme; consider before you die, how often you have made a poor wretch\r\nfreeze under your casement;[231] you shall die, you tyrant, you shall\r\ndie, with all those instruments of death and destruction about you,\r\nwith that enchanting smile, those killing ringlets of your hair\"--\"Give\r\nfire,\" said she, laughing. He did so, and shot her dead. Who can speak\r\nhis condition? But he bore it so patiently as to call up his man. The\r\npoor wretch entered, and his master locked the door upon him. \"Well,\"\r\nsaid he, \"did you charge these pistols?\" He answered, \"Yes.\" Upon which\r\nhe shot him dead with that remaining. After this, amidst a thousand\r\nbroken sobs, piercing groans, and distracted motions, he wrote the\r\nfollowing letter to the father of his dead mistress:--\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"I, who two hours ago told you truly I was the happiest man\r\n     alive, am now the most miserable. Your daughter lies dead at my\r\n     feet, killed by my hand, through a mistake of my man's charging\r\n     my pistols unknown to me. Him I have murdered for it. Such is my\r\n     wedding-day,--I will immediately follow my wife to her grave: but\r\n     before I throw myself upon my sword, I command my distraction so\r\n     far as to explain my story to you. I fear my heart will not keep\r\n     together till I have stabbed it. Poor good old man!--Remember, he\r\n     that killed your daughter, died for it. In the article of death\r\n     I give you my thanks, and pray for you, though I dare not for\r\n     myself. If it be possible, do not curse me.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[228] Æsop and Phalaris were certainly real persons, though the\r\n\"letters\" attributed to Phalaris are spurious.\r\n\r\n[229] Mons was taken on October 21, 1709 (N.S.).\r\n\r\n[230] The substance of this story of the Cornish lovers may have been\r\nsent to Steele by the \"Solomon Afterwit\" whose letter from Land's End\r\nis printed in the next number.\r\n\r\n[231] _Cf._ \"Paradise Lost,\" iv. 769, quoted in No. 79:--\r\n\r\n    \"Or serenade, which the starved lover sings\r\n    To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 83.

I happened this evening to fall into a coffee-house near\r\nthe 'Change, where two persons were reading my account of the table of\r\nfame.[233] The one of these was commenting as he read, and explaining\r\nwho was meant by this and the other worthy as he passed on. I observed\r\nthe person over against him wonderfully intent and satisfied with\r\nhis explanation. When he came to Julius Cæsar, who is said to have\r\nrefused any conductor to the table, \"No, no,\" said he, \"he is in the\r\nright of it, he has money enough to be welcome wherever he comes;\" and\r\nthen whispered, \"He means a certain colonel of the train-bands.\" Upon\r\nreading, that Aristotle made his claim with some rudeness, but great\r\nstrength of reason, \"Who can that be, so rough and so reasonable? It\r\nmust be some Whig I warrant you. There is nothing but party in these\r\npublic papers.\" Where Pythagoras is said to have a golden thigh,\r\n\"Ay, ay,\" said he, \"he has money enough in his breeches, that is the\r\nalderman of our ward.\" You must know, whatever he read, I found he\r\ninterpreted from his own way of life and acquaintance. I am glad my\r\nreaders can construe for themselves these difficult points; but for\r\nthe benefit of posterity, I design, when I come to write my last paper\r\nof this kind, to make it an explanation of all my former. In that piece\r\nyou shall have all I have commended, with their proper names. The\r\nfaulty characters must be left as they are, because we live in an age\r\nwherein vice is very general, and virtue very particular; for which\r\nreason the latter only wants explanation. But I must turn my present\r\ndiscourse to what is of yet greater regard to me than the care of my\r\nwritings; that is to say, the preservation of a lady's heart. Little\r\ndid I think I should ever have business of this kind on my hands more;\r\nbut as little as any one who knows me would believe it, there is a lady\r\nat this time who professes love to me. Her passion and good-humour you\r\nshall have in her own words.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n     \"I had formerly a very good opinion of myself; but it is now\r\n     withdrawn, and I have placed it upon you, Mr. Bickerstaff, for\r\n     whom I am not ashamed to declare, I have a very great passion\r\n     and tenderness. It is not for your face, for that I never saw;\r\n     your shape and height I am equally a stranger to: but your\r\n     understanding charms me, and I'm lost if you don't dissemble a\r\n     little love for me. I am not without hopes, because I am not like\r\n     the tawdry gay things that are fit only to make bone-lace. I am\r\n     neither childish-young, nor beldam-old, but (the world says) a\r\n     good agreeable woman.\r\n\r\n     \"Speak peace to a troubled heart, troubled only for you; and in\r\n     your next paper let me find your thoughts of me.\r\n\r\n     \"Don't think of finding out who I am, for notwithstanding your\r\n     interest in demons, they cannot help you either to my name, or a\r\n     sight of my face; therefore don't let them deceive you.\r\n\r\n     \"I can bear no discourse if you are not the subject; and, believe\r\n     me, I know more of love than you do of astronomy.\r\n\r\n     \"Pray say some civil things in return to my generosity, and you\r\n     shall have my very best pen employed to thank you, and I will\r\n     confirm it. I am\r\n\r\n  \"Your Admirer,\r\n  MARIA.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is something wonderfully pleasing in the favour of women;\r\nand this letter has put me in so good a humour, that nothing could\r\ndisplease me since I received it. My boy breaks glasses and pipes,\r\nand instead of giving him a knock of the pate, as my way is (for I\r\nhate scolding at servants), I only say, \"Ah! Jack, thou hast a head,\r\nand so has a pin;\" or some such merry expression. But alas! how am I\r\nmortified when he is putting on my fourth pair of stockings on these\r\npoor spindles of mine? The fair one understands love better than I\r\nastronomy! I am sure, without the help of that art, this poor meagre\r\ntrunk of mine is a very ill habitation for love. She is pleased to\r\nspeak civilly of my sense; but _ingenium male habitat_ is an invincible\r\ndifficulty in cases of this nature. I had always indeed, from a passion\r\nto please the eyes of the fair, a great pleasure in dress. Add to\r\nthis, that I have written songs since I was sixty, and have lived with\r\nall the circumspection of an old beau, as I am: but my friend Horace\r\nhas very well said, \"Every year takes something from us;\"[234] and\r\ninstructed me to form my pursuits and desires according to the stage\r\nof my life: therefore I have no more to value myself upon, than that\r\nI can converse with young people without peevishness, or wishing\r\nmyself a moment younger. For which reason, when I am amongst them, I\r\nrather moderate than interrupt their diversions. But though I have\r\nthis complacency, I must not pretend to write to a lady civil things,\r\nas Maria desires. Time was, when I could have told her, I had received\r\na letter from her fair hands; and, that if this paper trembled as she\r\nread it, it then best expressed its author, or some other gay conceit.\r\nThough I never saw her, I could have told her, that good sense and good\r\nhumour smiled in her eyes; that constancy and good nature dwelt in her\r\nheart; that beauty and good breeding appeared in all her actions. When\r\nI was five-and-twenty, upon sight of one syllable, even wrong spelt,\r\nby a lady I never saw, I could tell her, that her height was that\r\nwhich was fit for inviting our approach, and commanding our respect;\r\nthat a smile sat on her lips, which prefaced her expressions before\r\nshe uttered them, and her aspect prevented her speech. All she could\r\nsay, though she had an infinite deal of wit, was but a repetition of\r\nwhat was expressed by her form; her form! which struck her beholders\r\nwith ideas more moving and forcible than ever were inspired by music,\r\npainting, or eloquence. At this rate I panted in those days; but, ah!\r\nsixty-three! I am very sorry I can only return the agreeable Maria a\r\npassion, expressed rather from the head than the heart.\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\n     \"You have already seen the best of me, and I so passionately love\r\n     you, that I desire we may never meet. If you will examine your\r\n     heart, you will find, that you join the man with the philosopher:\r\n     and if you have that kind opinion of my sense as you pretend, I\r\n     question not, but you add to it complexion, air, and shape: but,\r\n     dear Molly, a man in his grand climacteric is of no sex. Be a good\r\n     girl; and conduct yourself with honour and virtue, when you love\r\n     one younger than myself. I am, with the greatest tenderness,\r\n\r\n  \"Your innocent Lover,\r\n  I.

Your cautions to the young men\r\n     against the vices of the town are very well: but there is one\r\n     not less needful, which I think you have omitted. I had from the\r\n     'Rough Diamond' (a gentleman so called from an honest blunt wit he\r\n     had) not long since dead, this observation, that a young man must\r\n     be at least three or four years in London before he dares say 'No.'\r\n\r\n     \"You will easily see the truth and force of this observation; for\r\n     I believe, more people are drawn away against their inclinations,\r\n     than with them. A young man is afraid to deny anybody going to\r\n     a tavern to dinner; or after being gorged there, to repeat the\r\n     same with another company at supper, or to drink excessively\r\n     if desired, or go to any other place, or commit any other\r\n     extravagancy proposed. The fear of being thought covetous, or\r\n     to have no money, or to be under the dominion or fear of his\r\n     parents and friends, hinders him from the free exercise of his\r\n     understanding, and affirming boldly the true reason, which is, his\r\n     real dislike of what is desired. If you could cure this slavish\r\n     facility, it would save abundance at their first entrance into the\r\n     world. I am, SIR,\r\n\r\n  \"Yours,\r\n  _Solomon Afterwit_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis epistle has given an occasion to a treatise on this subject,\r\nwherein I shall lay down rules when a young stripling is to say \"No,\"\r\nand a young virgin \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n_N.B._--For the publication of this discourse, I wait only for\r\nsubscriptions from the undergraduates of each University, and the young\r\nladies in the boarding-schools of Hackney and Chelsea.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. James's Coffee-house, October 19._\r\n\r\nLetters from the Hague of the 25th of October, N.S., advise, that the\r\ngarrison of Mons marched out on the 23rd instant, and a garrison of\r\nthe allies marched into the town.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, Oct. 20_, to _Saturday, Oct. 22, 1709_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, October 21._\r\n\r\nI have received a letter subscribed A. B.[235] wherein it has been\r\nrepresented to me as an enormity, that there are more than ordinary\r\ncrowds of women at the Old Bailey when a rape is to be tried: but by\r\nMr. A. B.'s favour, I can't tell who are so much concerned in that part\r\nof the law as the sex he mentions, they being the only persons liable\r\nto such insults. Nor indeed do I think it more unreasonable that they\r\nshould be inquisitive on such occasions, than men of honour when one\r\nis tried for killing another in a duel. It is very natural to inquire\r\nhow the fatal pass was made, that we may the better defend ourselves\r\nwhen we come to be attacked. Several eminent ladies appeared lately at\r\nthe Court of Justice on such an occasion, and with great patience and\r\nattention stayed the whole trials of two persons for the above-said\r\ncrime. The law to me indeed seems a little defective on this point;\r\nand it is a very great hardship, that this crime, which is committed\r\nby men only, should have men only on their jury. I humbly therefore\r\npropose, that on future trials of this sort, half of the twelve may be\r\nwomen; and those such whose faces are well known to have taken notes,\r\nor may be supposed to remember what happened in former trials in the\r\nsame place. There is the learned Androgyne, that would make a good\r\nfore-woman of the panel, who (by long attendance) understands as much\r\nlaw and anatomy as is necessary in this case. Till this is taken care\r\nof, I am humbly of opinion, it would be much more expedient that the\r\nfair were wholly absent: for to what end can it be that they should\r\nbe present at such examinations, when they can only be perplexed\r\nwith a fellow-feeling for the injured, without any power to avenge\r\ntheir sufferings. It is an unnecessary pain which the fair ones give\r\nthemselves on these occasions. I have known a young woman shriek out\r\nat some parts of the evidence; and have frequently observed, that when\r\nthe proof grew particular and strong, there has been such a universal\r\nflutter of fans, that one would think the whole female audience were\r\nfalling into fits. Nor indeed can I see how men themselves can be\r\nwholly unmoved at such tragical relations. In short, I must tell my\r\nfemale readers, and they may take an old man's word for it, that there\r\nis nothing in woman so graceful and becoming as modesty: it adds charms\r\nto their beauty, and gives a new softness to their sex. Without it,\r\nsimplicity and innocence appear rude, reading and good sense masculine,\r\nwit and humour lascivious. This is so necessary a qualification for\r\npleasing, that the loose part of womankind, whose study it is to\r\nensnare men's hearts, never fail to support the appearance of what\r\nthey know is so essential to that end: and I have heard it reported\r\nby the young fellows in my time, as a maxim of the celebrated Madam\r\nBennet,[236] that a young wench, though never so beautiful, was\r\nnot worth her board when she was past her blushing. This discourse\r\nnaturally brings into my thoughts a letter I have received from the\r\nvirtuous Lady Whittlestick on the subject of Lucretia.\r\n\r\n  _From my Tea-table,\r\n  October_ 17.\r\n\r\n  \"COUSIN ISAAC,\r\n\r\n     \"I read your _Tatler_ of Saturday last,[237] and was surprised\r\n     to see you so partial to your own sex, as to think none of ours\r\n     worthy to sit at your first table; for sure you cannot but own\r\n     Lucretia as famous as any you have placed there, who first parted\r\n     with her virtue, and afterwards with her life, to preserve her\r\n     fame.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Biddy Twig has written me a letter to the same purpose: but in\r\nanswer to both my pretty correspondents and kinswomen, I must tell\r\nthem, that although I know Lucretia would have made a very graceful\r\nfigure at the upper end of the table, I did not think it proper to\r\nplace her there, because I knew she would not care for being in the\r\ncompany of so many men without her husband. At the same time I must\r\nown, that Tarquin himself was not a greater lover and admirer of\r\nLucretia than I myself am in an honest way. When my sister Jenny was\r\nin her sampler, I made her get the whole story without book, and tell\r\nit me in needlework. This illustrious lady stands up in history as the\r\nglory of her own sex, and the reproach of ours; and the circumstances\r\nunder which she fell were so very particular, that they seem to make\r\nadultery and murder meritorious. She was a woman of such transcendent\r\nvirtue, that her beauty, which was the greatest of the age and country\r\nin which she lived, and is generally celebrated as the highest of\r\npraise in other women, is never mentioned as a part of her character.\r\nBut it would be declaiming to dwell upon so celebrated a story, which\r\nI mentioned only in respect to my kinswomen; and to make reparation\r\nfor the omission they complain of, do further promise them, that if\r\nthey can furnish me with instances to fill it, there shall be a small\r\ntea-table set apart in my palace of fame for the reception of all of\r\nher character.[238]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grecian Coffee-house, October 21._\r\n\r\nI was this evening communicating my design of producing obscure merit\r\ninto public view; and proposed to the learned, that they would please\r\nto assist me in the work. For the same end I publish my intention to\r\nthe world, that all men of liberal thoughts may know they have an\r\nopportunity of doing justice to such worthy persons as have come within\r\ntheir respective observation, and who by misfortune, modesty, or want\r\nof proper writers to recommend them, have escaped the notice of the\r\nrest of mankind. If therefore any one can bring any tale or tidings of\r\nillustrious persons, or glorious actions, that are not commonly known,\r\nhe is desired to send an account thereof to me at J. Morphew's, and\r\nthey shall have justice done them. At the same time that I have this\r\nconcern for men and things that deserve reputation and have it not, I\r\nam resolved to examine into the claims of such ancients and moderns as\r\nare in possession of it, with a design to displace them, in case I find\r\ntheir titles defective. The first whose merits I shall inquire into,\r\nare some merry gentlemen of the French nation, who have written very\r\nadvantageous histories of their exploits in war, love, and politics,\r\nunder the title of memoirs. I am afraid I shall find several of these\r\ngentlemen tardy, because I hear of them in no writings but their own.\r\nTo read the narrative of one of these authors, you would fancy there\r\nwas not an action in a whole campaign which he did not contrive or\r\nexecute; yet if you consult the history, or gazettes of those times,\r\nyou do not find him so much as the head of a party from one end of the\r\nsummer to the other. But it is the way of these great men, when they\r\nlie behind their lines, and are in a time of inaction, as they call\r\nit, to pass away their time in writing their exploits. By this means,\r\nseveral who are either unknown or despised in the present age, will\r\nbe famous in the next, unless a sudden stop be put to such pernicious\r\npractices. There are others of that gay people who (as I am informed)\r\nwill live half a year together in a garret, and write a history of\r\ntheir intrigues in the court of France. As for politicians, they do not\r\nabound with that species of men so much as we; but as ours are not so\r\nfamous for writing as for extemporary dissertations in coffee-houses,\r\nthey are more annoyed with memoirs of this nature also than we are. The\r\nmost immediate remedy that I can apply to prevent this growing evil,\r\nis, that I do hereby give notice to all booksellers and translators\r\nwhatsoever, that the word \"memoir\" is French for a novel; and to\r\nrequire of them, that they sell and translate it accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wills Coffee-house, October 21._\r\n\r\nComing into this place to-night, I met an old friend of mine,[239] who,\r\na little after the Restoration, wrote an epigram with some applause,\r\nwhich he has lived upon ever since; and by virtue of it, has been a\r\nconstant frequenter of this coffee-house for forty years. He took me\r\naside, and with a great deal of friendship told me, he was glad to\r\nsee me alive; \"for\" says he, \"Mr. Bickerstaff, I am sorry to find\r\nyou have raised many enemies by your lucubrations. There are indeed\r\nsome,\" says he, \"whose enmity is the greatest honour they can show a\r\nman; but have you lived to these years, and don't know, that the ready\r\nway to disoblige is to give advice? You may endeavour to guard your\r\nchildren, as you call them, but--\" He was going on; but I found the\r\ndisagreeableness of giving advice without being asked it, by my own\r\nimpatience of what he was about to say. In a word, I begged him to give\r\nme the hearing of a short fable.\r\n\r\n\"A gentleman,\" says I, \"who was one day slumbering in an arbour, was\r\non a sudden awakened by the gentle biting of a lizard, a little animal\r\nremarkable for its love to mankind. He threw it from his hand with some\r\nindignation, and was rising up to kill it, when he saw an huge venomous\r\nserpent sliding towards him on the other side, which he soon destroyed;\r\nreflecting afterwards with gratitude upon his friend that saved him,\r\nand with anger against himself, that had shown so little sense of a\r\ngood office.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[235] Perhaps Alexander Bayne (died 1737), an advocate then living\r\nin London, and afterwards Professor of Scots Law at Edinburgh. See\r\nHughes's \"Correspondence,\" i. 56.\r\n\r\n[236] A notorious character of the time of Charles II., to whom\r\nWycherley dedicated his \"Plain Dealer,\" under the title of \"My Lady\r\nB----,\" in a long ironical address respecting herself and women of her\r\nclass, which is praised by Steele in the _Spectator_ (No. 266).\r\n\r\n[237] No. 81.\r\n\r\n[238] \"A table of fame for the ladies will be published as soon as\r\nmaterials can be collected, to which end the public are desired to\r\ncontribute, and it will be gratefully acknowledged.\" (_Female Tatler_,\r\nNo. 58, Nov. 7, 1709.)\r\n\r\nThe writer of the \"General Postscript\" advertised his intention of\r\nerecting speedily a temple of honour for British heroes only (No.\r\n11, October 11, 1709).

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, Oct. 22_, to _Tuesday, Oct. 25, 1709_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, October 24._\r\n\r\nMy brother Tranquillus,[240] who is a man of business, came to me\r\nthis morning into my study, and after very many civil expressions\r\nin return for what good offices I had done him, told me, he desired\r\nto carry his wife, my sister, that very morning to his own house. I\r\nreadily told him I would wait upon him, without asking why he was so\r\nimpatient to rob us of his good company. He went out of my chamber, and\r\nI thought seemed to have a little heaviness upon him, which gave me\r\nsome disquiet. Soon after, my sister came to me with a very matron-like\r\nair, and most sedate satisfaction in her looks, which spoke her very\r\nmuch at ease; but the traces of her countenance seemed to discover\r\nthat she had been lately in passion, and that air of content to flow\r\nfrom a certain triumph upon some advantage obtained. She no sooner sat\r\ndown by me, but I perceived she was one of those ladies who begin to\r\nbe managers within the time of their being brides. Without letting her\r\nspeak (which I saw she had a mighty inclination to do), I said, \"Here\r\nhas been your husband, who tells me he has a mind to go home this very\r\nmorning; and I have consented to it.\" \"It is well,\" said she, \"for\r\nyou must know--\" \"Nay, Jenny,\" said I, \"I beg your pardon, for it is\r\nyou must know--you are to understand, that now is the time to fix or\r\nalienate your husband's heart for ever; and I fear you have been a\r\nlittle indiscreet in your expressions or behaviour towards him even\r\nhere in my house.\" \"There has,\" says she, \"been some words; but I'll\r\nbe judged by you if he was not in the wrong: nay, I need not be judged\r\nby anybody, for he gave it up himself, and said not a word, when he\r\nsaw me grow passionate, but 'Madam, you are perfectly in the right of\r\nit.' As you shall judge--\" \"Nay, madam,\" said I, \"I am judge already,\r\nand tell you, that you are perfectly in the wrong of it; for if it\r\nwas a matter of importance, I know he has better sense than you; if a\r\ntrifle, you know what I told you on your wedding-day, that you were to\r\nbe above little provocations.\" She knows very well I can be sour upon\r\noccasion, therefore gave me leave to go on. \"Sister,\" said I, \"I will\r\nnot enter into the dispute between you, which I find his prudence put\r\nan end to before it came to extremity, but charge you to have a care of\r\nthe first quarrel, as you tender your happiness; for then it is that\r\nthe mind will reflect harshly upon every circumstance that has ever\r\npassed between you. If such an accident is ever to happen (which I hope\r\nnever will), be sure to keep to the circumstance before you; make no\r\nallusions to what is past, or conclusions referring to what is to come:\r\ndon't show an hoard of matter for dissension in your breast; but if it\r\nis necessary, lay before him the thing as you understand it, candidly,\r\nwithout being ashamed of acknowledging an error, or proud of being\r\nin the right. If a young couple be not careful in this point, they\r\nwill get into a habit of wrangling: and when to displease is thought\r\nof no consequence, to please is always of as little moment. There is\r\na play, Jenny, I have formerly been at when I was a student: we got\r\ninto a dark corner with a porringer of brandy, and threw raisins into\r\nit, then set it on fire. My chamber-fellow and I diverted ourselves\r\nwith the sport of venturing our fingers for the raisins; and the\r\nwantonness of the thing was, to see each other look like a demon as we\r\nburnt ourselves and snatched out the fruit. This fantastical mirth was\r\ncalled snap-dragon. You may go into many a family, where you see the\r\nman and wife at this sport: every word at their table alludes to some\r\npassage between themselves; and you see by the paleness and emotion\r\nin their countenances, that it is for your sake, and not their own,\r\nthat they forbear playing out the whole game, in burning each other's\r\nfingers. In this case, the whole purpose of life is inverted, and the\r\nambition turns upon a certain contention, who shall contradict best,\r\nand not upon an inclination to excel in kindnesses and good offices.\r\nTherefore, dear Jenny, remember me, and avoid snap-dragon.\" \"I thank\r\nyou, brother,\" said she, \"but you don't know how he loves me; I find I\r\ncan do anything with him.\" \"If you can so, why should you desire to do\r\nanything but please him? But I have a word or two more before you go\r\nout of the room; for I see you do not like the subject I am upon. Let\r\nnothing provoke you to fall upon an imperfection he cannot help; for\r\nif he has a resenting spirit, he will think your aversion as immovable\r\nas the imperfection with which you upbraid him. But above all, dear\r\nJenny, be careful of one thing, and you will be something more than\r\nwoman, that is, a levity you are almost all guilty of, which is, to\r\ntake a pleasure in your power to give pain. It is even in a mistress\r\nan argument of meanness of spirit, but in a wife it is injustice and\r\ningratitude. When a sensible man once observes this in a woman, he\r\nmust have a very great or a very little spirit to overlook it. A woman\r\nought therefore to consider very often, how few men there are who\r\nwill regard a meditated offence as a weakness of temper.\" I was going\r\non in my confabulation, when Tranquillus entered. She cast her eyes\r\nupon him with much shame and confusion, mixed with great complacency\r\nand love, and went up to him. He took her in his arms, and looked so\r\nmany soft things at one glance, that I could see he was glad I had\r\nbeen talking to her, sorry she had been troubled, and angry at himself\r\nthat he could not disguise the concern he was in an hour before. After\r\nwhich, he says to me, with an air awkward enough, but methought not\r\nunbecoming, \"I have altered my mind, brother; we'll live upon you a\r\nday or two longer.\" I replied, \"That's what I have been persuading\r\nJenny to ask of you; but she is resolved never to contradict your\r\ninclination, and refused me.\" We were going on in that way which one\r\nhardly knows how to express; as when two people mean the same thing\r\nin a nice case, but come at it by talking as distantly from it as they\r\ncan; when very opportunely came in upon us an honest inconsiderable\r\nfellow, Tim Dapper, a gentleman well known to us both. Tim is one of\r\nthose who are very necessary by being very inconsiderable. Tim dropped\r\nin at an incident when we knew not how to fall into either a grave or\r\na merry way. My sister took this occasion to make off, and Dapper gave\r\nus an account of all the company he had been in to-day, who was and who\r\nwas not at home, where he visited. This Tim is the head of a species:\r\nhe is a little out of his element in this town; but he is a relation\r\nof Tranquillus, and his neighbour in the country, which is the true\r\nplace of residence for this species. The habit of a Dapper, when he is\r\nat home, is a light broadcloth, with calamanco[241] or red waistcoat\r\nand breeches; and it is remarkable, that their wigs seldom hide the\r\ncollar of their coats. They have always a peculiar spring in their\r\narms, a wriggle in their bodies, and a trip in their gait; all which\r\nmotions they express at once in their drinking, bowing, or saluting\r\nladies; for a distant imitation of a forward fop, and a resolution to\r\novertop him in his way, are the distinguishing marks of a Dapper. These\r\nunder-characters of men are parts of the sociable world by no means to\r\nbe neglected: they are like pegs in a building. They make no figure in\r\nit, but hold the structure together, and are as absolutely necessary\r\nas the pillars and columns. I am sure we found it so this morning; for\r\nTranquillus and I should perhaps have looked cold at each other the\r\nwhole day, but Dapper fell in with his brisk way, shook us both by the\r\nhand, rallied the bride, mistook the acceptance he met with amongst\r\nus for extraordinary perfection in himself, and heartily pleased,\r\nand was pleased, all the while he stayed. His company left us all in\r\ngood-humour, and we were not such fools as to let it sink, before we\r\nconfirmed it by great cheerfulness and openness in our carriage the\r\nwhole evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n_White's Chocolate-house, October 24._\r\n\r\nI have been this evening to visit a lady who is a relation of the\r\nenamoured Cynthio,[242] and there heard the melancholy news of his\r\ndeath. I was in hopes that fox-hunting and October would have recovered\r\nhim from his unhappy passion. He went into the country with a design\r\nto leave behind him all thoughts of Clarissa; but he found that place\r\nonly more convenient to think of her without interruption. The country\r\ngentlemen were very much puzzled upon his case, and never finding him\r\nmerry or loud in their company, took him for a Roman Catholic, and\r\nimmediately upon his death seized his French valet-de-chambre for a\r\npriest; and it is generally thought in the county, it will go hard with\r\nhim next session. Poor Cynthio never held up his head after having\r\nreceived a letter of Clarissa's marriage. The lady who gave me this\r\naccount being far gone in poetry and romance, told me, if I would\r\ngive her an epitaph, she would take care to have it placed on his\r\ntomb; which she herself had devised in the following manner: it is to\r\nbe made of black marble, and every corner to be crowned with weeping\r\ncupids. Their quivers are to be hung up upon two tall cypress-trees\r\nwhich are to grow on each side of the monument, and their arrows to\r\nbe laid in a great heap, after the manner of a funeral pile, on which\r\nis to lie the body of the deceased. On the top of each cypress is to\r\nstand the figure of a moaning turtle-dove. On the uppermost part of the\r\nmonument, the goddess to whom these birds are sacred, is to sit in a\r\ndejected posture, as weeping for the death of her votary. I need not\r\ntell you this lady's head is a little turned: however, to be rid of\r\nimportunities, I promised her an epitaph, and told her, I would take\r\nfor my pattern that of Don Alonzo, who was no less famous in his age\r\nthan Cynthio is in ours.\r\n\r\n            THE EPITAPH.[243]\r\n\r\n        Here lies Don Alonzo,\r\n    Slain by a wound received under\r\n            His left pap;\r\n      The orifice of which was so\r\n        Small, no surgeon could\r\n            Discover it.\r\n\r\n                READER,\r\n\r\n    If thou wouldst avoid so strange\r\n              A death,\r\n    Look not upon Lucinda's eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[240] See No. 79.\r\n\r\n[241] Calamanco is a woollen stuff made plain, striped, checked, or\r\nfigured, and glazed in finishing.

[ADDISON and STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, Oct. 25_, to _Thursday, Oct. 27, 1709_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, October 26._[244]\r\n\r\nWhen I came home last night, my servant delivered me the following\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n  \"SIR,\r\n\r\n  _October 24._\r\n\r\n     \"I have orders from Sir Harry Quicksett, of Staffordshire, Bart.,\r\n     to acquaint you, that his honour Sir Harry himself, Sir Giles\r\n     Wheelbarrow, Kt.; Thomas Rentfree, Esq., Justice of the Quorum;\r\n     Andrew Windmill, Esq.; and Mr. Nicholas Doubt of the Inner\r\n     Temple, Sir Harry's grandson, will wait upon you at the hour of\r\n     nine to-morrow morning, being Tuesday the 25th of October, upon\r\n     business which Sir Harry will impart to you by word of mouth. I\r\n     thought it proper to acquaint you beforehand so many persons of\r\n     quality came, that you might not be surprised therewith. Which\r\n     concludes, though by many years' absence since I saw you at\r\n     Stafford, unknown,\r\n\r\n  \"Sir,\r\n  Your most humble Servant,\r\n  JOHN THRIFTY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI received this message with less surprise than I believe Mr.\r\nThrifty imagined; for I knew the good company too well to feel any\r\npalpitations at their approach: but I was in very great concern how I\r\nshould adjust the ceremonial, and demean myself to all these great men,\r\nwho perhaps had not seen anything above themselves for these twenty\r\nyears last past. I am sure that's the case of Sir Harry. Besides which,\r\nI was sensible that there was a great point in adjusting my behaviour\r\nto the simple squire, so as to give him satisfaction, and not disoblige\r\nthe Justice of the Quorum. The hour of nine was come this morning, and\r\nI had no sooner set chairs (by the steward's letter), and fixed my\r\ntea-equipage, but I heard a knock at my door, which was opened, but no\r\none entered; after which followed a long silence, which was broke at\r\nlast by, \"Sir, I beg your pardon; I think I know better:\" and another\r\nvoice, \"Nay, good Sir Giles----\" I looked out from my window, and saw\r\nthe good company all with their hats off, and arms spread, offering\r\nthe door to each other. After many offers, they entered with much\r\nsolemnity, in the order Mr. Thrifty was so kind as to name them to\r\nme. But they are now got to my chamber door, and I saw my old friend\r\nSir Harry enter. I met him with all the respect due to so reverend\r\na vegetable; for you are to know, that is my sense of a person who\r\nremains idle in the same place for half a century. I got him with\r\ngreat success into his chair by the fire, without throwing down any\r\nof my cups. The knight-bachelor told me, he had a great respect for\r\nmy whole family, and would, with my leave, place himself next to Sir\r\nHarry, at whose right hand he had sat at every Quarter Sessions this\r\nthirty years, unless he was sick. The steward in the rear whispered the\r\nyoung Templar, \"That's true to my knowledge.\" I had the misfortune,\r\nas they stood cheek by jowl, to desire the simple squire to sit down\r\nbefore the Justice of the Quorum, to the no small satisfaction of the\r\nformer, and resentment of the latter. But I saw my error too late,\r\nand got them as soon as I could into their seats. \"Well,\" said I,\r\n\"gentlemen, after I have told you how glad I am of this great honour,\r\nI am to desire you to drink a dish of tea.\" They answered one and all,\r\nthat they never drank tea in a morning. \"Not in a morning!\" said I,\r\nstaring round me. Upon which the pert jackanapes Nick Doubt tipped me\r\nthe wink, and put out his tongue at his grandfather. Here followed a\r\nprofound silence, when the steward, in his boots and whip, proposed,\r\nthat we should adjourn to some public-house, where everybody might call\r\nfor what they pleased, and enter upon the business. We all stood up\r\nin an instant, and Sir Harry filed off from the left very discreetly,\r\ncountermarching behind the chairs towards the door: after him, Sir\r\nGiles in the same manner. The simple squire made a sudden start to\r\nfollow; but the Justice of the Quorum whipped between upon the stand\r\nof the stairs. A maid going up with coals made us halt, and put us\r\ninto such confusion, that we stood all in a heap, without any visible\r\npossibility of recovering our order; for the young jackanapes seemed to\r\nmake a jest of this matter, and had so contrived, by pressing amongst\r\nus under pretence of making way, that his grandfather was got into the\r\nmiddle, and he knew nobody was of quality to stir a step till Sir Harry\r\nmoved first. We were fixed in this perplexity for some time, till we\r\nheard a very loud noise in the street; and Sir Harry asking what it\r\nwas, I, to make them move, said it was fire. Upon this, all ran down\r\nas fast as they could, without order or ceremony, till we got into\r\nthe street, where we drew up in very good order, and filed off down\r\nSheer Lane, the impertinent Templar driving us before him, as in a\r\nstring, and pointing to his acquaintance who passed by. I must confess\r\nI love to use people according to their own sense of good-breeding,\r\nand therefore whipped in between the Justice and the simple squire.\r\nHe could not properly take this ill; but I overheard him whisper the\r\nsteward, that he thought it hard that a common conjuror should take\r\nplace of him, though an elder squire. In this order we marched down\r\nSheer Lane, at the upper end of which I lodge.[245] When we came to\r\nTemple Bar, Sir Harry and Sir Giles got over; but a run of the coaches\r\nkept the rest of us on this side the street: however, we all at last\r\nlanded, and drew up in very good order before Ben Tooke's[246] shop,\r\nwho favoured our rallying with great humanity. From hence we proceeded\r\nagain, till we came to Dick's Coffee-house,[247] where I designed to\r\ncarry them. Here we were at our old difficulty, and took up the street\r\nupon the same ceremony. We proceeded through the entry, and were so\r\nnecessarily kept in order by the situation, that we were now got into\r\nthe coffee-house itself, where, as soon as we arrived, we repeated our\r\ncivilities to each other; after which, we marched up to the high table,\r\nwhich has an ascent to it enclosed in the middle of the room. The whole\r\nroom was alarmed at this entry, made up of persons of so much state and\r\nrusticity. Sir Harry called for a mug of ale, and Dyer's Letter.[248]\r\nThe boy brought the ale in an instant; but said, they did not take in\r\nthe Letter. \"No!\" says Sir Harry: \"then take back your mug; we are like\r\nindeed to have good liquor at this house.\" Here the Templar tipped me\r\na second wink, and if I had not looked very grave upon him, I found he\r\nwas disposed to be very familiar with me. In short, I observed after a\r\nlong pause, that the gentlemen did not care to enter upon business till\r\nafter their morning draught, for which reason I called for a bottle of\r\nmum[249]; and finding that had no effect upon them, I ordered a second,\r\nand a third: after which, Sir Harry reached over to me, and told me in\r\na low voice, that the place was too public for business; but he would\r\ncall upon me again to-morrow morning at my own lodgings, and bring some\r\nmore friends with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will's Coffee-house, October 26._\r\n\r\nThough this place is frequented by a more mixed company than it used to\r\nbe formerly, yet you meet very often some whom one cannot leave without\r\nbeing the better for their conversation. A gentleman this evening,\r\nin a dictating manner, talked I thought very pleasingly in praise of\r\nmodesty, in the midst of ten or twelve libertines, upon whom it seemed\r\nto have had a good effect. He represented it as the certain indication\r\nof a great and noble spirit. \"Modesty,\" said he, \"is the virtue which\r\nmakes men prefer the public to their private interest, the guide of\r\nevery honest undertaking, and the great guardian of innocence; it makes\r\nmen amiable to their friends, and respected by their very enemies.\r\nIn all places, and on all occasions, it attracts benevolence, and\r\ndemands approbation. One might give instances out of antiquity[250]\r\nof the irresistible force of this quality in great minds: Cicereius,\r\nand Cneius Scipio, the son of the great Africanus, were competitors\r\nfor the office of prætor. The crowd followed Cicereius, and left\r\nScipio unattended. Cicereius saw this with much concern, and desiring\r\nan audience of the people, he descended from the place where the\r\ncandidates were to sit, in the eye of the multitude, pleaded for his\r\nadversary, and with an ingenuous modesty (which it is impossible to\r\nfeign) represented to them, how much it was to their dishonour, that\r\na virtuous son of Africanus should not be preferred to him, or any\r\nother man whatsoever. This immediately gained the election for Scipio;\r\nbut all the compliments and congratulations upon it were made to\r\nCicereius. It is easier in this case to say who had the office, than\r\nthe honour. There is no occurrence in life where this quality is not\r\nmore ornamental than any other. After the battle of Pharsalia, Pompey\r\nmarching towards Larissus, the whole people of that place came out\r\nin procession to do him honour. He thanked the magistrates for their\r\nrespect to him; but desired them to perform these ceremonies to the\r\nconqueror. This gallant submission to his fortune, and disdain of\r\nmaking any appearance but like Pompey, was owing to his modesty, which\r\nwould not permit him to be so disingenuous as to give himself the air\r\nof prosperity, when he was in the contrary condition. This I say of\r\nmodesty, as it is the virtue which preserves a decorum in the general\r\ncourse of our life; but considering it also as it regards our mere\r\nbodies, it is the certain character of a great mind. It is memorable\r\nof the mighty Cæsar, that when he was murdered in the Capitol, at the\r\nvery moment in which he expired, he gathered his robe about him, that\r\nhe might fall in a decent posture. In this manner (says my author) he\r\nwent off, not like a man that departed out of life, but a deity that\r\nreturned to his abode.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[244] Tickell included the article \"From my own Apartment\" in his\r\nedition of Addison's Works, but stated that Steele assisted in this\r\npaper. Upon which pompous Bishop Hurd adds, \"One sees this by the\r\npertness of the manner in which many parts of it are composed.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, Oct. 27_, to _Saturday, Oct. 29, 1709_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will's Coffee-house, October 28._\r\n\r\nThere is nothing which I contemplate with greater pleasure than the\r\ndignity of human nature, which often shows itself in all conditions of\r\nlife: for notwithstanding the degeneracy and meanness that is crept\r\ninto it, there are a thousand occasions in which it breaks through its\r\noriginal corruption, and shows what it once was, and what it will be\r\nhereafter. I consider the soul of man as the ruin of a glorious pile\r\nof building; where, amidst great heaps of rubbish, you meet with noble\r\nfragments of sculpture, broken pillars and obelisks, and a magnificence\r\nin confusion. Virtue and wisdom are continually employed in clearing\r\nthe ruins, removing these disorderly heaps, recovering the noble pieces\r\nthat lie buried under them, and adjusting them as well as possible\r\naccording to their ancient symmetry and beauty. A happy education,\r\nconversation with the finest spirits, looking abroad into the works of\r\nnature, and observations upon mankind, are the great assistances to\r\nthis necessary and glorious work. But even among those who have never\r\nhad the happiness of any of these advantages, there are sometimes\r\nsuch exertions of the greatness that is natural to the mind of man,\r\nas show capacities and abilities, which only want these accidental\r\nhelps to fetch them out, and show them in a proper light. A plebeian\r\nsoul is still the ruin of this glorious edifice, though encumbered\r\nwith all its rubbish. This reflection rose in me from a letter which\r\nmy servant dropped as he was dressing me, and which he told me was\r\ncommunicated to him, as he is an acquaintance of some of the persons\r\nmentioned in it. The epistle is from one Sergeant Hall of the Foot\r\nGuards. It is directed to Sergeant Cabe, in the Coldstream Regiment of\r\nFoot Guards,[251] at the Red Lettice[252] in the Butcher Row,[253] near\r\nTemple Bar.\r\n\r\nI was so pleased with several touches in it, that I could not forbear\r\nshowing it to a cluster of critics, who, instead of considering it in\r\nthe light I have done, examined it by the rules of epistolary writing:\r\nfor as these gentlemen are seldom men of any great genius, they work\r\naltogether by mechanical rules, and are able to discover no beauties\r\nthat are not pointed out by Bouhours and Rapin.[254] The letter is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  _From the Camp before Mons,\r\n  September 26._\r\n\r\n  \"COMRADE,\r\n\r\n     \"I received yours, and am glad yourself and your wife are in good\r\n     health, with all the rest of my friends. Our battalion suffered\r\n     more than I could wish in the action;[255] but who can withstand\r\n     Fate? Poor Richard Stephenson had his fate with a great many more:\r\n     he was killed dead before we entered the trenches. We had above\r\n     200 of our battalion killed and wounded: we lost 10 sergeants; 6\r\n     are as followeth: Jennings, Castles, Roach, Sherring, Meyrick,\r\n     and my son Smith. The rest are not your acquaintance. I have\r\n     received a very bad shot in my head myself, but am in hopes, and\r\n     please God, I shall recover. I continue in the field, and lie at\r\n     my colonel's quarters. Arthur is very well; but I can give you no\r\n     account of Elms; he was in the hospital before I came into the\r\n     field. I will not pretend to give you an account of the battle,\r\n     knowing you have a better in the prints. Pray give my service to\r\n     Mrs. Cook and her daughter, to Mr. Stoffet and his wife, and to\r\n     Mr. Lyver, and Thomas Hogsdon, and to Mr. Ragdell, and to all my\r\n     friends and acquaintance in general who do ask after me. My love\r\n     to Mrs. Stephenson: I am sorry for the sending such ill news. Her\r\n     husband was gathering a little money together to send to his wife,\r\n     and put it into my hands. I have seven shillings and threepence,\r\n     which I shall take care to send her. Wishing your wife a safe\r\n     delivery, and both of you all happiness, rest\r\n\r\n  \"Your assured Friend and Comrade,\r\n  JOHN HALL.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We had but an indifferent breakfast, but the mounseers never had such\r\na dinner in all their lives.\r\n\r\n\"My kind love to my comrade Hinton, and Mrs. Morgan, and to John Brown\r\nand his wife. I sent two shillings, and Stephenson sixpence, to drink\r\nwith you at Mr. Cook's; but I have heard nothing from him. It was by\r\nMr. Edgar.\r\n\r\n\"Corporal Hartwell desires to be remembered to you, and desires you to\r\ninquire of Edgar, what is become of his wife Peg; and when you write,\r\nto send word in your letter what trade she drives.\r\n\r\n\"We have here very bad weather, which I doubt will be a hindrance to\r\nthe siege;[256] but I am in hopes we shall be masters of the town in a\r\nlittle time, and then I believe we shall go to garrison.\"\r\n\r\nI saw the critics prepared to nibble at my letter; therefore examined\r\nit myself, partly in their way, and partly my own. \"This is,\" said I,\r\n\"truly a letter, and an honest representation of that cheerful heart\r\nwhich accompanies the poor soldier in his warfare. Is not there in this\r\nall the topic of submitting to our destiny as well discussed as if a\r\ngreater man had been placed, like Brutus, in his tent at midnight,\r\nreflecting on all the occurrences of past life, and saying fine things\r\non \"being\" itself? What Sergeant Hall knows of the matter, is, that he\r\nwishes there had not been so many killed, and he had himself a very\r\nbad shot in the head, and should recover if it pleased God. But be\r\nthat as it will, he takes care, like a man of honour, as he certainly\r\nis, to let the widow Stephenson know, that he had seven and threepence\r\nfor her; and that if he lives, he is sure he shall go into garrison at\r\nlast. I doubt not but all the good company at the Red Lettice drank his\r\nhealth with as much real esteem as we do any of our friends. All that\r\nI am concerned for, is, that Mrs. Peggy Hartwell may be offended at\r\nshowing this letter, because her conduct in Mr. Hartwell's absence is a\r\nlittle inquired into. But I could not sink that circumstance, because\r\nyou critics would have lost one of the parts which I doubt not but you\r\nhave much to say upon, whether the familiar way is well hit in this\r\nstyle or not? As for myself, I take a very particular satisfaction in\r\nseeing any letter that is fit only for those to read who are concerned\r\nin it, but especially on such a subject: for if we consider the heap\r\nof an army, utterly out of all prospect of rising and preferment, as\r\nthey certainly are, and such great things executed by them, it is\r\nhard to account for the motive of their gallantry. But to me, who was\r\na cadet at the battle of Coldstream, in Scotland, when Monck charged\r\nat the head of the regiment, now called Coldstream from the victory\r\nof that day;[257] (I remember it as well as if it were yesterday) I\r\nstood on the left of old West, who I believe is now at Chelsea: I say,\r\nto me, who know very well this part of mankind, I take the gallantry\r\nof private soldiers to proceed from the same, if not from a nobler,\r\nimpulse than that of gentlemen and officers. They have the same taste\r\nof being acceptable to their friends, and go through the difficulties\r\nof that profession by the same irresistible charm of fellowship, and\r\nthe communication of joys and sorrows, which quickens the relish of\r\npleasure, and abates the anguish of pain. Add to this, that they have\r\nthe same regard to fame, though they do not expect so great a share as\r\nmen above them hope for; but I will engage, Sergeant Hall would die\r\nten thousand deaths, rather than a word should be spoken at the Red\r\nLettice, or any part of the Butcher Row, in prejudice to his courage\r\nor honesty. If you will have my opinion then of the sergeant's letter,\r\nI pronounce the style to be mixed, but truly epistolary; the sentiment\r\nrelating to his own wound, is in the sublime; the postscript of Peg\r\nHartwell, in the gay; and the whole, the picture of the bravest sort of\r\nmen, that is to say, a man of great courage and small hopes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, October 28._\r\n\r\nWhen I came home this evening, I found, after many attempts to\r\nvary my thoughts, that my head still ran upon the subject of the\r\ndiscourse to-night at Will's. I fell therefore into the amusement of\r\nproportioning the glory of a battle among the whole army, and dividing\r\nit into shares, according to the method of the Million Lottery.[258] In\r\nthis bank of fame, by an exact calculation, and the rules of political\r\narithmetic, I have allotted ten hundred thousand shares; five hundred\r\nthousand of which is the due of the general, two hundred thousand I\r\nassign to the general officers, and two hundred thousand more to all\r\nthe commissioned officers, from colonels to ensigns; the remaining\r\nhundred thousand must be distributed among the non-commissioned\r\nofficers and private men: according to which computation, I find\r\nSergeant Hall is to have one share and a fraction of two-fifths. When I\r\nwas a boy at Oxford, there was among the antiquities near the theatre\r\na great stone, on which were engraven the names of all who fell in\r\nthe battle of Marathon. The generous and knowing people of Athens\r\nunderstood the force of the desire of glory, and would not let the\r\nmeanest soldier perish in oblivion. Were the natural impulse of the\r\nBritish animated with such monuments, what man would be so mean as not\r\nto hazard his life for his ten-hundred-thousandth part of the honour in\r\nsuch a day as that of Blenheim or Blaregnies?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[251] This had been Steele's own regiment.\r\n\r\n[252] In the address of Sergeant Hall's letter the Red Lettice is spelt\r\naccording to the original, but this is a corruption of Red Lattice; it\r\nsignifies a chequered or reticulated window of this colour, no uncommon\r\nsign of a public-house. A house with a red lattice is mentioned in \"The\r\nGlass of Government,\" a tragi-comedy by Geo. Gascoigne, 1575.\r\n\r\nThe Chequers, at the date of this paper a very common sign of a\r\npublic-house, was the representation of a kind of draught-board called\r\n\"tables,\" signifying that that game might be played there. From their\r\ncolour, which was red, and their similarity to a lattice, it was\r\ncorruptly called the Red Lattice, which word is frequently used by\r\nancient writers to signify an ale-house (Nichols). Mr. Dobson points\r\nout that Falstaff speaks of \"red-lattice phrases\" (\"Merry Wives of\r\nWindsor,\" Act ii. sc. 2.), and Staunton says, \"Ale-houses in old times\r\nwere distinguished by _red lattices_, as dairies have since been by\r\n_green_ ones.\"\r\n\r\n[253] A narrow street between the back side of St. Clement's and\r\nShipyard, in the Strand.

He mentions in particular the words\r\n\"gunner\" and \"gunster,\" which my correspondent observes they make use\r\nof when anything has been related that is strange and surprising;\r\nand therefore desires I would explain those terms, as I have many\r\nothers, for the information of such as live at a distance from this\r\ntown and court, which he calls the great mints of language. His letter\r\nis dated from York; and (if he tells me truth) a word in its ordinary\r\ncirculation does not reach that city within the space of five years\r\nafter it is first stamped. I cannot say how long these words have been\r\ncurrent in town, but I shall now take care to send them down by the\r\nnext post.\r\n\r\nI must in the first place observe, that the words \"gunner\" and\r\n\"gunster\" are not to be used promiscuously; for a gunner, properly\r\nspeaking, is not a gunster: nor is a gunster, _vice versâ_, a gunner.\r\nThey both indeed are derived from the word \"gun,\" and so far they\r\nagree. But as a gun is remarkable for its destroying at a distance,\r\nor for the report it makes, which is apt to startle all its hearers,\r\nthose who recount strange accidents and circumstances, which have no\r\nmanner of foundation in truth, when they design to do mischief are\r\ncomprehended under the appellation of gunners; but when they endeavour\r\nonly to surprise and entertain, they are distinguished by the name of\r\ngunsters. Gunners therefore are the pest of society; but the gunsters\r\noften the diversion. The gunner is destructive, and hated; the gunster\r\ninnocent, and laughed at. The first is prejudicial to others, the other\r\nonly to himself.\r\n\r\nThis being premised, I must in the next place subdivide the gunner into\r\nseveral branches: all or the chief of which are I think as follow:\r\n\r\n  First, the Bombardier.\r\n  Secondly, the Miner.\r\n  Thirdly, the Squib.\r\n  Fourthly, the Serpent.\r\n\r\nAnd first, of the first. The bombardier tosses his balls sometimes\r\ninto the midst of a city, with a design to fill all around him with\r\nterror and combustion. He has been sometimes known to drop a bomb in\r\na Senate-house, and to scatter a panic over a nation. But his chief\r\naim is at several eminent stations, which he looks upon as the fairest\r\nmarks, and uses all his skill to do execution upon those who possess\r\nthem. Every man so situated, let his merit be never so great, is sure\r\nto undergo a bombardment. It is further observed, that the only way to\r\nbe out of danger from the bursting of a bomb, is to lie prostrate on\r\nthe ground; a posture too abject for generous spirits.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the Miner.\r\n\r\nAs the bombardier levels his mischief at nations and cities, the miner\r\nbusies himself in ruining and overturning private houses and particular\r\npersons. He often acts as a spy, in discovering the secret avenues and\r\nunguarded accesses of families, where, after he has made his proper\r\ndiscoveries and dispositions, he sets sudden fire to his train, that\r\nblows up families, scatters friends, separates lovers, disperses\r\nkindred, and shakes a whole neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted, that several females are great proficients in this\r\nway of engineering. The marks by which they are to be known, are a\r\nwonderful solicitude for the reputation of their friends, and a more\r\nthan ordinary concern for the good of their neighbours. There is also\r\nin them something so very like religion as may deceive the vulgar;\r\nbut if you look upon it very nearly, you see on it such a cast of\r\ncensoriousness, as discovers it to be nothing but hypocrisy. Cleomilla\r\nis a great instance of a female miner; but as my design is to expose\r\nonly the incorrigible, let her be silent for the future, and I shall be\r\nso too.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the Squib.\r\n\r\nThe squibs are those who in the common phrase of the world are called\r\nlibellers, lampooners, and pamphleteers. Their fireworks are made up\r\nin paper; and it is observed, that they mix abundance of charcoal in\r\ntheir powder, that they may be sure to blacken where they cannot singe.\r\nThese are observed to give a consternation and disturbance only to weak\r\nminds; which, according to the proverb, are always more afraid than\r\nhurt.\r\n\r\nFourthly, Serpents.\r\n\r\nThe serpents are a petty kind of gunners, more pernicious than any\r\nof the rest. They make use of a sort of white powder, that goes off\r\nwithout any violent crack, but gives a gentle sound, much like that of\r\na whisper; and is more destructive in all parts of life than any of the\r\nmaterials made use of by any of the fraternity.\r\n\r\nCome we now to the Gunsters.\r\n\r\nThis race of engineers deals altogether in wind-guns,[259] which, by\r\nrecoiling often, knock down those who discharge them, without hurting\r\nanybody else; and according to the various compressions of the air,\r\nmake such strange squeaks, cracks, pops, and bounces, as it is\r\nimpossible to hear without laughing. It is observable, however, that\r\nthere is a disposition in a gunster to become a gunner; and though\r\ntheir proper instruments are only loaded with wind, they often, out\r\nof wantonness, fire a bomb, or spring a mine, out of their natural\r\ninclination to engineering; by which means they do mischief when they\r\ndon't design it, and have their bones broken when they don't deserve it.\r\n\r\nThis sort of engineers are the most unaccountable race of men in the\r\nworld: some of them have received above a hundred wounds, and yet have\r\nnot a scar in their bodies; some have debauched multitudes of women who\r\nhave died maids. You may be with them from morning till night, and the\r\nnext day they shall tell you a thousand adventures that happened when\r\nyou were with them, which you know nothing of. They have a quality of\r\nhaving been present at everything they hear related; and never heard\r\na man commended who was not their intimate acquaintance, if not their\r\nkinsman.\r\n\r\nI hope these notes may serve as a rough draught for a new establishment\r\nof engineers, which I shall hereafter fill up with proper persons,\r\naccording to my own observations on their conduct, having already had\r\none recommended to me for the general of my artillery. But that, and\r\nall the other posts, I intend to keep open, till I can inform myself\r\nof the candidates, having resolved in this case to depend no more upon\r\ntheir friend's word than I would upon their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, October 31._[260]\r\n\r\nI was this morning awakened by a sudden shake of the house; and as soon\r\nas I had got a little out of my consternation, I felt another, which\r\nwas followed by two or three repetitions of the same convulsion. I\r\ngot up as fast as possible, girt on my rapier, and snatched up my hat,\r\nwhen my landlady came up to me, and told me, that the gentlewoman of\r\nthe next house begged me to step thither; for that a lodger she had\r\ntaken in was run mad, and she desired my advice; as indeed everybody\r\nin the whole lane does upon important occasions. I am not like some\r\nartists, saucy because I can be beneficial, but went immediately.\r\nOur neighbour told us, she had the day before let her second floor\r\nto a very genteel youngish man, who told her, he kept extraordinary\r\ngood hours, and was generally at home most part of the morning and\r\nevening at study; but that this morning he had for an hour together\r\nmade this extravagant noise which we then heard. I went upstairs with\r\nmy hand upon the hilt of my rapier, and approached this new lodger's\r\ndoor. I looked in at the key-hole, and there I saw a well-made man\r\nlook with great attention on a book, and on a sudden, jump into the\r\nair so high, that his head almost touched the ceiling. He came down\r\nsafe on his right foot, and again flew up, alighting on his left;\r\nthen looked again at his book, and holding out his right leg, put it\r\ninto such a quivering motion, that I thought he would have shaken it\r\noff. He used the left after the same manner, when on a sudden, to my\r\ngreat surprise, he stooped himself incredibly low, and turned gently\r\non his toes. After this circular motion, he continued bent in that\r\nhumble posture for some time, looking on his book. After this, he\r\nrecovered himself with a sudden spring, and flew round the room in\r\nall the violence and disorder imaginable, till he made a full pause\r\nfor want of breath. In this interim my woman asked what I thought:\r\nI whispered, that I thought this learned person an enthusiast, who\r\npossibly had his first education in the peripatetic way, which was a\r\nsect of philosophers who always studied when walking. But observing him\r\nmuch out of breath, I thought it the best time to master him if he were\r\ndisordered, and knocked at his door. I was surprised to find him open\r\nit, and say with great civility and good mien, that he hoped he had not\r\ndisturbed us. I believed him in a lucid interval, and desired he would\r\nplease to let me see his book. He did so, smiling. I could not make\r\nanything of it, and therefore asked in what language it was written.\r\nHe said, it was one he studied with great application; but it was his\r\nprofession to teach it, and could not communicate his knowledge without\r\na consideration. I answered, that I hoped he would hereafter keep his\r\nthoughts to himself; for his meditation this morning had cost me three\r\ncoffee-dishes and a clean pipe. He seemed concerned at that, and told\r\nme, he was a dancing-master, and had been reading a dance or two before\r\nhe went out, which had been written by one who taught at an academy in\r\nFrance.[261] He observed me at a stand, and went on to inform me, that\r\nnow articulate motions, as well as sounds, were expressed by proper\r\ncharacters, and that there is nothing so common as to communicate a\r\ndance by a letter. I besought him hereafter to meditate in a ground\r\nroom, for that otherwise it would be impossible for an artist of any\r\nother kind to live near him; and that I was sure, several of his\r\nthoughts this morning would have shaken my spectacles off my nose, had\r\nI been myself at study.\r\n\r\nI then took my leave of this virtuoso, and returned to my chamber,\r\nmeditating on the various occupations of rational creatures.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[259] In the _Postman_ for August 19, 1702, the person mentioned in Dr.\r\nBurnet's Travels from Basel, in Switzerland, advertises his arrival,\r\nand his having brought several sorts of wind-guns and horse-pistols,\r\nmade for the late K. William, to be shown at the price of sixpence\r\napiece; but he hopes the nobility will be induced to give more, as he\r\nhas some curiosities besides, not mentioned.\r\n\r\n\"There is in Basel a gunsmith that maketh wind-guns, and he showed\r\nme one, that as it received at once air for ten shot, so it had this\r\npeculiar to it, which he pretends is his own invention, that he can\r\ndischarge all the air that can be parcelled out in ten shot at once\r\nto give a home blow. I confess those are terrible instruments, and\r\nit seems the interest of mankind to forbid them quite.\" (Burnet's\r\n\"Letters,\" &c., 1687, page 236, quoted by Nichols.)\r\n\r\n[260] This article is by Addison.\r\n\r\n[261] Thoinet Arbeau, a dancing-master at Paris, who was the inventor\r\nof the art of writing dances in characters, called orchesography.\r\nMusic, about the year 1709, was generally printed in most countries, as\r\nwell as in England, on letterpress types. Engravings on copperplates\r\nwere used almost eighty years before in Italy, and the music of many\r\nsingle songs was engraved here about the year 1700, by one Thomas\r\nCross.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, Nov. 1_, to _Thursday, Nov. 3, 1709_.\r\n\r\n    Rura mihi placeant, riguique in vallibus amnes,\r\n    Flumina amem sylvasque inglorius.\r\n\r\n  VIRG., Georg. ii. 485.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grecian Coffee-house, Nov. 2._\r\n\r\nI have received this short epistle from an unknown hand:[262]\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"I have no more to trouble you with, than to desire you would\r\n     in your next help me to some answer to the enclosed concerning\r\n     yourself. In the meantime I congratulate you upon the increase of\r\n     your fame, which you see has extended itself beyond the bills of\r\n     mortality.\r\n\r\n     \"'SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"'That the country is barren of news, has been the excuse time\r\n     out of mind for dropping a correspondence with our friends in\r\n     London; as if it were impossible out of a coffee-house to write\r\n     an agreeable letter. I am too ingenuous to endeavour at the\r\n     covering of my negligence with so common an excuse. Doubtless,\r\n     amongst friends bred as we have been, to the knowledge of\r\n     books as well as men, a letter dated from a garden, a grotto, a\r\n     fountain, a wood, a meadow, or the banks of a river, may be more\r\n     entertaining than one from Tom's,[263] Will's, White's, or St.\r\n     James's. I promise therefore to be frequent for the future in my\r\n     rural dates to you: but for fear you should, from what I have\r\n     said, be induced to believe I shun the commerce of men, I must\r\n     inform you, that there is a fresh topic of discourse lately risen\r\n     amongst the ingenious in our part of the world, and is become the\r\n     more fashionable for the ladies giving into it. This we owe to\r\n     Isaac Bickerstaff, who is very much censured by some, and as much\r\n     justified by others. Some criticise his style, his humour, and\r\n     his matter; others admire the whole man: some pretend, from the\r\n     informations of their friends in town, to decipher the author; and\r\n     others confess they are lost in their guesses. For my part, I must\r\n     own myself a professed admirer of the paper, and desire you to\r\n     send me a complete set, together with your thoughts of the squire\r\n     and his lucubrations.'\"\r\n\r\nThere is no pleasure like that of receiving praise from the\r\npraiseworthy; and I own it a very solid happiness, that these my\r\nlucubrations are approved by a person of so fine a taste as the author\r\nof this letter, who is capable of enjoying the world in the simplicity\r\nof its natural beauties. This pastoral letter, if I may so call it,\r\nmust be written by a man who carries his entertainment wherever he\r\ngoes, and is undoubtedly one of those happy men who appear far\r\notherwise to the vulgar. I daresay, he is not envied by the vicious,\r\nthe vain, the frolic, and the loud; but is continually blessed with\r\nthat strong and serious delight which flows from a well-taught and\r\nliberal mind. With great respect to country sports, I may say, this\r\ngentleman could pass his time agreeably if there were not a hare or a\r\nfox in his county. That calm and elegant satisfaction which the vulgar\r\ncall melancholy, is the true and proper delight of men of knowledge\r\nand virtue. What we take for diversion, which is a kind of forgetting\r\nourselves, is but a mean way of entertainment, in comparison of that\r\nwhich is considering, knowing, and enjoying ourselves. The pleasures of\r\nordinary people are in their passions; but the seat of this delight is\r\nin the reason and understanding. Such a frame of mind raises that sweet\r\nenthusiasm which warms the imagination at the sight of every work of\r\nnature, and turns all around you into picture and landscape. I shall be\r\never proud of advices from this gentleman; for I profess writing news\r\nfrom the learned as well as the busy world.\r\n\r\nAs for my labours, which he is pleased to inquire after, if they can\r\nbut wear one impertinence out of human life, destroy a single vice, or\r\ngive a morning's cheerfulness to an honest mind; in short, if the world\r\ncan be but one virtue the better, or in any degree less vicious, or\r\nreceive from them the smallest addition to their innocent diversions, I\r\nshall not think my pains, or indeed my life, to have been spent in vain.\r\n\r\nThus far as to my studies. It will be expected I should in the next\r\nplace give some account of my life. I shall therefore, for the\r\nsatisfaction of the present age, and the benefit of posterity, present\r\nthe world with the following abridgment of it.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, that I was bred by hand, and ate nothing but milk\r\ntill I was a twelvemonth old; from which time, to the eighth year of\r\nmy age, I was observed to delight in pudding and potatoes; and indeed\r\nI retain a benevolence for that sort of food to this day. I do not\r\nremember that I distinguished myself in anything at those years, but\r\nby my great skill at taw, for which I was so barbarously used, that\r\nit has ever since given me an aversion to gaming. In my twelfth year,\r\nI suffered very much for two or three false concords. At fifteen,\r\nI was sent to the university, and stayed there for some time; but\r\na drum passing by (being a lover of music), I listed myself for a\r\nsoldier.[264] As years came on, I began to examine things, and grew\r\ndiscontented at the times. This made me quit the sword, and take to\r\nthe study of the occult sciences, in which I was so wrapped up, that\r\nOliver Cromwell had been buried, and taken up again, five years before\r\nI heard he was dead. This gave me first the reputation of a conjurer,\r\nwhich has been of great disadvantage to me ever since, and kept me out\r\nof all public employments. The greater part of my later years has been\r\ndivided between Dick's Coffee-house, the Trumpet in Sheer Lane, and my\r\nown lodgings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Nov. 2._\r\n\r\nThe evil of unseasonable visits has been complained of to me with much\r\nvehemence by persons of both sexes; and I am desired to consider this\r\nvery important circumstance, that men may know how to regulate their\r\nconduct in an affair which concerns no less than life itself. For to a\r\nrational creature, it is almost the same cruelty to attack his life,\r\nby robbing him of so many moments of his time, or so many drops of his\r\nblood. The author of the following letter has a just delicacy on this\r\npoint, and has put it into a very good light.\r\n\r\n  \"MR. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n  _Oct. 29._\r\n\r\nI am very much afflicted with the gravel, which makes me sick and\r\npeevish. I desire to know of you, if it be reasonable that any of my\r\nacquaintance should take advantage over me at this time, and afflict\r\nme with long visits, because they are idle, and I am confined. Pray,\r\nsir, reform the town in this matter. Men never consider whether the\r\nsick person be disposed for company, but make their visits to humour\r\nthemselves. You may talk upon this topic, so as to oblige all persons\r\nafflicted with chronic distempers, among which I reckon visits. Don't\r\nthink me a sour man, for I love conversation and my friends; but I\r\nthink one's most intimate friend may be too familiar, and that there\r\nare such things as unseasonable wit and painful mirth.\"\r\n\r\nIt is with some so hard a thing to employ their time, that it is a\r\ngreat good fortune when they have a friend indisposed, that they may be\r\npunctual in perplexing him, when he is recovered enough to be in that\r\nstate which cannot be called sickness or health; when he is too well to\r\ndeny company, and too ill to receive them. It is no uncommon case, if a\r\nman is of any figure or power in the world, to be congratulated into a\r\nrelapse.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will's Coffee-house, Nov. 2._\r\n\r\nI was very well pleased this evening to hear a gentleman express a\r\nvery becoming indignation against a practice which I myself have been\r\nvery much offended at. \"There is nothing,\" said he, \"more ridiculous\r\nthan for an actor to insert words of his own in the part he is to act,\r\nso that it is impossible to see the poet for the player: you will\r\nhave Pinkethman and Bullock helping out Beaumont and Fletcher. It puts\r\nme in mind,\" continued he, \"of a collection of antique statues which\r\nI once saw in a gentleman's possession, who employed a neighbouring\r\nstone-cutter to add noses, ears, arms, or legs, to the maimed works of\r\nPhidias or Praxiteles. You may be sure this addition disfigured the\r\nstatues much more than time had. I remember a Venus that, by the nose\r\nhe had given her, looked like Mother Shipton; and a Mercury with a pair\r\nof legs that seemed very much swelled with a dropsy.\"\r\n\r\nI thought the gentleman's observations very proper; and he told me,\r\nI had improved his thought, in mentioning on this occasion those\r\nwise commentators who had filled up the hemistichs of Virgil;[265]\r\nparticularly that notable poet, who, to make the \"Æneid\" more perfect,\r\ncarried on the story to Lavinia's wedding.[266] If the proper officer\r\nwill not condescend to take notice of these absurdities, I shall\r\nmyself, as a censor of the people, animadvert upon such proceedings.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[262] See No. 112.\r\n\r\n[263] Tom's Coffee-house, in Russell Street, opposite Button's, was\r\nnamed after the landlord, Captain Thomas West. Macky (\"A Journey\r\nthrough England,\" 1722, i. 172) says, \"After the play the best company\r\ngenerally go to Tom's and Will's Coffee-houses, near adjoining, where\r\nthere is playing at piquet, and the best of conversation till midnight.\r\nHere you will see blue and green ribbons and stars sitting familiarly.\"\r\n\r\n[264] Here and elsewhere Steele describes his own life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 90. [STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, Nov. 3_, to _Saturday, Nov. 5, 1709_.\r\n\r\n    ----Amoto quæramus seria ludo.--HOR., 1 Sat. i. 27.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will's Coffee-house, Nov. 4._\r\n\r\nThe passion of love happened to be the subject of discourse between two\r\nor three of us at the table of the poets this evening; and among other\r\nobservations, it was remarked, that the same sentiment on this passion\r\nhad run through all languages and nations. Menmius, who has a very good\r\ntaste, fell into a little sort of dissertation on this occasion. \"It\r\nis,\" said he, \"remarkable, that no passion has been treated by all who\r\nhave touched upon it with the same bent of design but this. The poets,\r\nthe moralists, the painters, in all their descriptions, allegories,\r\nand pictures, have represented it as a soft torment, a bitter sweet, a\r\npleasing pain, or an agreeable distress, and have only expressed the\r\nsame thought in a different manner. The[267] joining of pleasure and\r\npain together in such devices, seems to me the only pointed thought I\r\never read which is natural; and it must have proceeded from its being\r\nthe universal sense and experience of mankind, that they have all\r\nspoken of it in the same manner. I have in my own reading remarked\r\na hundred and three epigrams, fifty odes, and ninety-one sentences\r\ntending to this sole purpose. It is certain, there is no other passion\r\nwhich does produce such contrary effects in so great a degree: but\r\nthis may be said for love, that if you strike it out of the soul, life\r\nwould be insipid, and our being but half animated. Human nature would\r\nsink into deadness and lethargy, if not quickened with some active\r\nprinciple; and as for all others, whether ambition, envy, or avarice,\r\nwhich are apt to possess the mind in the absence of this passion, it\r\nmust be allowed that they have greater pains, without the compensation\r\nof such exquisite pleasures as those we find in love. The great skill\r\nis to heighten the satisfactions, and deaden the sorrows of it, which\r\nhas been the end of many of my labours, and shall continue to be so\r\nfor the service of the world in general, and in particular of the fair\r\nsex who are always the best or the worst part of it. It is pity that\r\na passion which has in it a capacity of making life happy, should\r\nnot be cultivated to the utmost advantage. Reason, prudence, and\r\ngood-nature, rightly applied, can thoroughly accomplish this great end,\r\nprovided they have always a real and constant love to work upon. But\r\nthis subject I shall treat more at large in the history of my married\r\nsister; and in the meantime, shall conclude my reflection on the\r\npains and pleasures which attend this passion with one of the finest\r\nallegories which I think I have ever read. It is invented by the divine\r\nPlato, and to show the opinion he himself had of it, ascribed by him\r\nto his admired Socrates, whom he represents as discoursing with his\r\nfriends, and giving the history of love in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\"At the birth of Beauty,\" says he, \"there was a great feast made, and\r\nmany guests invited: among the rest was the god Plenty, who was the son\r\nof the goddess Prudence, and inherited many of his mother's virtues.\r\nAfter a full entertainment, he retired into the garden of Jupiter,\r\nwhich was hung with a great variety of ambrosial fruits, and seems\r\nto have been a very proper retreat for such a guest. In the meantime\r\nan unhappy female, called Poverty, having heard of this great feast,\r\nrepaired to it in hopes of finding relief. The first place she lights\r\nupon was Jupiter's garden, which generally stands open to people of all\r\nconditions. Poverty enters, and by chance finds the god Plenty asleep\r\nin it. She was immediately fired with his charms, laid herself down\r\nby his side, and managed matters so well that she conceived a child\r\nby him. The world was very much in suspense upon the occasion, and\r\ncould not imagine to themselves what would be the nature of an infant\r\nthat was to have its original from two such parents. At the last, the\r\nchild appears; and who should it be but Love. This infant grew up, and\r\nproved in all his behaviour what he really was, a compound of opposite\r\nbeings. As he is the son of Plenty (who was the offspring of Prudence),\r\nhe is subtle, intriguing, full of stratagems and devices; as the son\r\nof Poverty, he is fawning, begging, serenading, delighting to lie at a\r\nthreshold or beneath a window. By the father, he is audacious, full of\r\nhopes, conscious of merit, and therefore quick of resentment: by the\r\nmother, he is doubtful, timorous, mean-spirited, fearful of offending,\r\nand abject in submissions. In the same hour you may see him transported\r\nwith raptures, talking of immortal pleasures, and appearing satisfied\r\nas a god; and immediately after, as the mortal mother prevails in his\r\ncomposition, you behold him pining, languishing, despairing, dying.\"\r\n\r\nI have been always wonderfully delighted with fables, allegories, and\r\nthe like inventions, which the politest and the best instructors of\r\nmankind have always made use of: they take off from the severity of\r\ninstruction, and enforce it at the same time that they conceal it. The\r\nsupposing Love to be conceived immediately after the birth of Beauty,\r\nthe parentage of Plenty, and the inconsistency of this passion with\r\nitself so naturally derived to it, are great master-strokes in this\r\nfable; and if they fell into good hands, might furnish out a more\r\npleasing canto than any in Spenser.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Nov. 4._\r\n\r\nI came home this evening in a very pensive mood; and to divert me,\r\ntook up a volume of Shakespeare, where I chanced to cast my eye upon\r\na part in the tragedy of \"Richard the Third,\" which filled my mind\r\nwith a very agreeable horror. It was the scene in which that bold\r\nbut wicked prince is represented as sleeping in his tent the night\r\nbefore the battle in which he fell. The poet takes that occasion to set\r\nbefore him in a vision a terrible assembly of apparitions, the ghosts\r\nof all those innocent persons whom he is said to have murdered. Prince\r\nEdward, Henry VI., the Duke of Clarence, Rivers, Gray, and Vaughan,\r\nLord Hastings, the two young princes, sons to Edward IV., his own wife,\r\nand the Duke of Buckingham rise up in their blood before him, beginning\r\ntheir speeches with that dreadful salutation, \"Let me sit heavy on thy\r\nsoul to-morrow;\" and concluding with that dismal sentence, \"Despair and\r\ndie.\" This inspires the tyrant with a dream of his past guilt, and of\r\nthe approaching vengeance. He anticipates the fatal day of Bosworth,\r\nfancies himself dismounted, weltering in his own blood; and in the\r\nagonies of despair (before he is thoroughly awake), starts up with the\r\nfollowing speech:\r\n\r\n    _Give me another horse--Bind up my wounds!\r\n    Have mercy, Jesu--Soft, I did but dream.\r\n    O coward Conscience! How dost thou afflict me?\r\n    The lights burn blue! Is it not dead midnight?\r\n    Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh;\r\n    What do I fear? Myself!_ &c.[268]\r\n\r\nA scene written with so great strength of imagination indisposed me\r\nfrom further reading, and threw me into a deep contemplation. I began\r\nto reflect upon the different ends of good and bad kings; and as this\r\nwas the birthday of our late renowned monarch,[269] I could not forbear\r\nthinking on the departure of that excellent prince, whose life was\r\ncrowned with glory, and his death with peace. I let my mind go so far\r\ninto this thought, as to imagine to myself, what might have been the\r\nvision of his departing slumbers. He might have seen confederate kings\r\napplauding him in different languages, slaves that had been bound in\r\nfetters lifting up their hands and blessing him, and the persecuted in\r\ntheir several forms of worship imploring comfort on his last moments.\r\nThe reflection upon this excellent prince's mortality had been a\r\nvery melancholy entertainment to me, had I not been relieved by the\r\nconsideration of the glorious reign which succeeds it.\r\n\r\nWe now see as great a virtue as ever was on the British throne,\r\nsurrounded with all the beauty of success. Our nation may not only\r\nboast of a long series of great, regular, and well-laid designs, but\r\nalso of triumphs and victories; while we have the happiness to see our\r\nsovereign exercise that true policy which tends to make a kingdom great\r\nand happy, and at the same time enjoy the good and glorious effect of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[265] This was done by Joannes des Peyrareda, a gentleman of Aquitaine.\r\n\r\n[266] Mapheus Vegius, of Lodi (1407-1458), added a thirteenth book to\r\nthe \"Æneid,\" with an account of the marriage of Æneas and Lavinia.\r\n\r\n[267] The remainder of this article from Will's is by Addison.\r\n\r\n[268] \"King Richard the Third,\" Act v. sc. 3.\r\n\r\n[269] William III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 91. [STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, Nov. 5_, to _Tuesday, Nov. 8, 1709_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Nov. 7._\r\n\r\nI was very much surprised this evening with a visit from one of the\r\ntop toasts of the town, who came privately in a chair, and bolted\r\ninto my room, while I was reading a chapter of Agrippa upon the\r\noccult sciences; but as she entered with all the air and bloom that\r\nnature ever bestowed on woman, I threw down the conjurer, and met the\r\ncharmer. I had no sooner placed her at my right hand by the fire, but\r\nshe opened to me the reason of her visit. \"Mr. Bickerstaff,\" said the\r\nfine creature, \"I have been your correspondent some time, though I\r\nnever saw you before; I have writ by the name of Maria.[270] You have\r\ntold me you were too far gone in life to think of love; therefore I am\r\nanswered as to the passion I spoke of, and,\" continued she, smiling, \"I\r\nwill not stay till you grow young again (as you men never fail to do\r\nin your dotage), but am come to consult you about disposing of myself\r\nto another. My person you see; my fortune is very considerable; but I\r\nam at present under much perplexity how to act in a great conjuncture.\r\nI have two lovers, Crassus and Lorio. Crassus is prodigiously rich,\r\nbut has no one distinguishing quality; though at the same time he\r\nis not remarkable on the defective side. Lorio has travelled, is\r\nwell bred, pleasant in discourse, discreet in his conduct, agreeable\r\nin his person; and with all this, he has a competency of fortune\r\nwithout superfluity. When I consider Lorio, my mind is filled with an\r\nidea of the great satisfactions of a pleasant conversation. When I\r\nthink of Crassus, my equipage, numerous servants, gay liveries, and\r\nvarious dresses are opposed to the charms of his rival. In a word,\r\nwhen I cast my eyes upon Lorio, I forget and despise fortune; when I\r\nbehold Crassus, I think only of pleasing my vanity, and enjoying an\r\nuncontrolled expense in all the pleasures of life, except love.\" She\r\npaused here. \"Madam,\" said I, \"I am confident you have not stated your\r\ncase with sincerity, and that there is some secret pang which you have\r\nconcealed from me: for I see by your aspect the generosity of your\r\nmind; and that open ingenuous air lets me know, that you have too great\r\na sense of the generous passion of love, to prefer the ostentation of\r\nlife in the arms of Crassus, to the entertainments and conveniences\r\nof it in the company of your beloved Lorio; for so he is indeed,\r\nmadam. You speak his name with a different accent from the rest of your\r\ndiscourse: the idea his image raises in you, gives new life to your\r\nfeatures, and new grace to your speech. Nay, blush not, madam, there\r\nis no dishonour in loving a man of merit: I assure you, I am grieved\r\nat this dallying with yourself, when you put another in competition\r\nwith him, for no other reason but superior wealth.\" \"To tell you then,\"\r\nsaid she, \"the bottom of my heart, there's Clotilda lies by, and plants\r\nherself in the way of Crassus, and I am confident will snap him, if I\r\nrefuse him. I cannot bear to think that she will shine above me. When\r\nour coaches meet, to see her chariot hung behind with four footmen,\r\nand mine with but two: hers, powdered, gay, and saucy, kept only for\r\nshow; mine, a couple of careful rogues that are good for something:\r\nI own, I cannot bear that Clotilda should be in all the pride and\r\nwantonness of wealth, and I only in the ease and affluence of it.\"\r\nHere I interrupted: \"Well, madam, now I see your whole affliction:\r\nyou could be happy, but that you fear another would be happier; or\r\nrather, you could be solidly happy, but that another is to be happy\r\nin appearance. This is an evil which you must get over, or never know\r\nhappiness. We will put the case, madam, that you married Crassus, and\r\nshe Lorio.\" She answered, \"Speak not of it--I could tear her eyes out\r\nat the mention of it.\" \"Well, then, I pronounce Lorio to be the man:\r\nbut I must tell you, that what we call settling in the world, is in a\r\nkind leaving it; and you must at once resolve to keep your thoughts\r\nof happiness within the reach of your fortune, and not measure it by\r\ncomparison with others. But indeed, madam, when I behold that beauteous\r\nform of yours, and consider the generality of your sex, as to their\r\ndisposal of themselves in marriage, or their parents doing it for them\r\nwithout their own approbation, I cannot but look upon all such matches\r\nas the most impudent prostitutions. Do but observe when you are at\r\na play, the familiar wenches that sit laughing among the men. These\r\nappear detestable to you in the boxes: each of them would give up her\r\nperson for a guinea; and some of you would take the worst there for\r\nlife for twenty thousand. If so, how do you differ but in price? As to\r\nthe circumstance of marriage, I take that to be hardly an alteration\r\nof the case; for wedlock is but a more solemn prostitution where there\r\nis not a union of minds. You would hardly believe it, but there have\r\nbeen designs even upon me. A neighbour in this very lane, who knows I\r\nhave, by leading a very wary life, laid up a little money, had a great\r\nmind to marry me to his daughter. I was frequently invited to their\r\ntable. The girl was always very pleasant and agreeable. After dinner,\r\nMiss Molly would be sure to fill my pipe for me, and put more sugar\r\nthan ordinary into my coffee; for she was sure I was good-natured. If\r\nI chanced to hem, the mother would applaud my vigour; and has often\r\nsaid on that occasion, 'I wonder, Mr. Bickerstaff, you don't marry; I\r\nam sure you would have children.' Things went so far that my mistress\r\npresented me with a wrought nightcap and a laced band of her own\r\nworking. I began to think of it in earnest; but one day, having an\r\noccasion to ride to Islington, as two or three people were lifting\r\nme upon my pad, I spied her at a convenient distance laughing at her\r\nlover, with a parcel of romps of her acquaintance: one of them, who I\r\nsuppose had the same design upon me, told me she said, 'Do you see how\r\nbriskly my old gentleman mounts?' This made me cut off my amour, and\r\nto reflect with myself, that no married life could be so unhappy, as\r\nwhere the wife proposes no other advantage from her husband, than that\r\nof making herself fine, and keeping her out of the dirt.\"\r\n\r\nMy fair client burst out a-laughing at the account I gave her of my\r\nescape, and went away seemingly convinced of the reasonableness of my\r\ndiscourse to her.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was gone, my maid brought up the following epistle,\r\nwhich by the style and the description she gave of the person, I\r\nsuppose was left by Nick Doubt. \"Harkee,\" said he, \"girl, tell old\r\nBasket-hilt, I would have him answer it by the first opportunity.\" What\r\nhe says is this:\r\n\r\n     \"ISAAC,\r\n\r\n     \"You seem a very honest fellow; therefore pray tell me, did not\r\n     you write that letter in praise of the squire and his lucubrations\r\n     yourself?\" &c.[271]\r\n\r\nThe greatest plague of coxcombs is, that they often break upon you with\r\nan impertinent piece of good sense, as this jackanapes has hit me in\r\na right place enough. I must confess, I am as likely to play such a\r\ntrick as another; but that letter he speaks of was really genuine. When\r\nI first set up, I thought it fair enough to let myself know from all\r\nparts that my works were wonderfully inquired for, and were become the\r\ndiversion, as well as instruction, of all the choice spirits in every\r\ncounty of Great Britain. I do not doubt but the more intelligent of my\r\nreaders found it, before this jackanapes (I can call him no better)\r\ntook upon him to observe upon my style and my basket-hilt. A very\r\npleasant gentleman of my acquaintance told me one day a story of this\r\nkind of falsehood and vanity in an author. Mævius showed him a paper of\r\nverses, which he said he had received that morning by the penny post\r\nfrom an unknown hand. My friend admired them extremely. \"Sir,\" said\r\nhe, \"this must come from a man that is eminent: you see fire, life,\r\nand spirit run through the whole, and at the same time a correctness,\r\nwhich shows he is used to writing. Pray, Sir, read them over again.\"\r\nHe begins again, title and all: \"To Mævius on his incomparable poems.\"\r\nThe second reading was performed with much more vehemence and action\r\nthan the former; after which my friend fell into downright raptures.\r\n\"Why, they are truly sublime! There is energy in this line! description\r\nin that! Why, it is the thing itself! This is perfect picture!\" Mævius\r\ncould bear no more; \"but, faith,\" says he, \"Ned, to tell you the plain\r\ntruth, I writ them myself.\"\r\n\r\nThere goes just such another story of the same paternal tenderness in\r\nBavius, an ingenious contemporary of mine, who had written several\r\ncomedies, which were rejected by the players. This my friend Bavius\r\ntook for envy, and therefore prevailed upon a gentleman to go with him\r\nto the play-house, and gave him a new play of his, desiring he would\r\npersonate the author, and read it, to baffle the spite of the actors.\r\nThe friend consented, and to reading they went. They had not gone over\r\nthree similes before Roscius the player made the acting author stop,\r\nand desired to know, what he meant by such a rapture? and how it\r\ncame to pass, that in this condition of the lover, instead of acting\r\naccording to his circumstances, he spent his time in considering what\r\nhis present state was like? \"That is very true,\" says the mock-author,\r\n\"I believe we had as good strike these lines out.\" \"By your leave,\"\r\nsays Mævius, \"you shall not spoil your play, you are too modest; those\r\nvery lines, for aught I know, are as good as any in your play, and\r\nthey shall stand.\" Well, they go on, and the particle \"and\" stood\r\nunfortunately at the end of a verse, and was made to rhyme to the\r\nword \"stand.\" This Roscius excepted against. The new poet gave up\r\nthat too, and said, he would not dispute for a monosyllable--\"For a\r\nmonosyllable!\" says the real author; \"I can assure you, a monosyllable\r\nmay be of as great force as a word of ten syllables. I tell you, sir,\r\n'and' is the connection of the matter in that place; without that\r\nword, you may put all that follows into any other play as well as\r\nthis. Besides, if you leave it out, it will look as if you had put it\r\nin only for the sake of the rhyme.\" Roscius persisted, assuring the\r\ngentleman, that it was impossible to speak it but the \"and\" must be\r\nlost; so it might as well be blotted out. Bavius snatched his play out\r\nof their hands, said they were both blockheads, and went off; repeating\r\na couplet, because he would not make his exit irregularly. A witty man\r\nof these days compared this true and feigned poet to the contending\r\nmothers before Solomon: the true one was easily discovered from the\r\npretender, by refusing to see his offspring dissected.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[270] See No. 83.\r\n\r\n[271] In No. 58 of the _Female Tatler_ Thomas Baker insinuated that\r\nSteele wrote the letter in No. 89 of the _Tatler_ himself.\r\n\r\nThe following advertisement is subjoined to _The General Postscript_,\r\nNo. 19 (Wednesday, November 9, 1709):\r\n\r\n\"Nick Doubt desires the public to take notice, that he did not bring\r\nthat letter to Basket-hilt's maid, that begins, 'Isaac, you seem a very\r\nhonest fellow;' and he's a double jackanapes that thinks he'd disturb\r\nthe squire's 'lucubrations' with any such impertinent messages.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 92. [STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, Nov. 8_, to _Thursday, Nov. 10, 1709_.\r\n\r\n    Falsus honor juvat, et mendax infamia terret\r\n    Quem nisi mendosum et mendacem?\r\n\r\n  HOR., I Ep. xvi. 40.\r\n\r\n\r\n_White's Chocolate-house, Nov. 9._\r\n\r\nI know no manner of speaking so offensive as that of giving praise,\r\nand closing it with an exception; which proceeds (where men do not\r\ndo it to introduce malice, and make calumny more effectual) from the\r\ncommon error of considering man as a perfect creature. But if we\r\nrightly examine things, we shall find, that there is a sort of economy\r\nin Providence, that one shall excel where another is defective, in\r\norder to make men more useful to each other, and mix them in society.\r\nThis man having this talent, and that man another, is as necessary\r\nin conversation, as one professing one trade, and another another,\r\nis beneficial in commerce. The happiest climate does not produce all\r\nthings; and it was so ordered, that one part of the earth should want\r\nthe product of another, for uniting mankind in a general correspondence\r\nand good understanding. It is therefore want of good sense as well as\r\ngood nature, to say, Simplicius has a better judgment, but not so much\r\nwit, as Latius; for that these have not each other's capacities, is\r\nno more a diminution to either than if you should say, Simplicius is\r\nnot Latius, or Latius not Simplicius. The heathen world had so little\r\nnotion that perfection was to be expected amongst men, that among\r\nthem any one quality or endowment in an heroic degree made a god.\r\nHercules had strength; but it was never objected to him that he wanted\r\nwit. Apollo presided over wit, and it was never asked whether he had\r\nstrength. We hear no exceptions against the beauty of Minerva, or the\r\nwisdom of Venus. These wise heathens were glad to immortalise any one\r\nserviceable gift, and overlook all imperfections in the person who\r\nhad it; but with us it is far otherwise, for we reject many eminent\r\nvirtues, if they are accompanied with one apparent weakness. The\r\nreflecting after this manner, made me account for the strange delight\r\nmen take in reading lampoons and scandal, with which the age abounds,\r\nand of which I receive frequent complaints. Upon mature consideration,\r\nI find it is principally for this reason that the worst of mankind, the\r\nlibellers, receive so much encouragement in the world. The low race of\r\nmen take a secret pleasure in finding an eminent character levelled\r\nto their condition by a report of its defects, and keep themselves in\r\ncountenance, though they are excelled in a thousand virtues, if they\r\nbelieve they have in common with a great person any one fault. The\r\nlibeller falls in with this humour, and gratifies this baseness of\r\ntemper, which is naturally an enemy to extraordinary merit. It is from\r\nthis that libel and satire are promiscuously joined together in the\r\nnotions of the vulgar, though the satirist and libeller differ as much\r\nas the magistrate and the murderer. In the consideration of human life,\r\nthe satirist never falls upon persons who are not glaringly faulty,\r\nand the libeller on none but who are conspicuously commendable. Were I\r\nto expose any vice in a good or great man, it should certainly be by\r\ncorrecting it in some one where that crime was the most distinguishing\r\npart of the character; as pages are chastised for the admonition of\r\nprinces.[272] When it is performed otherwise, the vicious are kept\r\nin credit by placing men of merit in the same accusation. But all the\r\npasquils,[273] lampoons, and libels we meet with nowadays, are a sort\r\nof playing with the four-and-twenty letters, and throwing them into\r\nnames and characters, without sense, truth, or wit. In this case, I am\r\nin great perplexity to know whom they mean, and should be in distress\r\nfor those they abuse, if I did not see their judgment and ingenuity\r\nin those they commend. This is the true way of examining a libel;\r\nand when men consider, that no one man living thinks the better of\r\ntheir heroes and patrons for the panegyric given them, none can think\r\nthemselves lessened by their invective. The hero or patron in a libel\r\nis but a scavenger to carry off the dirt, and by that very employment\r\nis the filthiest creature in the street. Dedications and panegyrics\r\nare frequently ridiculous, let them be addressed where they will; but\r\nat the front, or in the body of a libel, to commend a man, is saying\r\nto the persons applauded, \"My Lord, or Sir, I have pulled down all\r\nmen that the rest of the world think great and honourable, and here\r\nis a clear stage; you may as you please be valiant or wise; you may\r\nchoose to be on the military or civil list; for there is no one brave\r\nwho commands, or just who has power: you may rule the world now it is\r\nempty, which exploded you when it was full: I have knocked out the\r\nbrains of all whom mankind thought good for anything; and I doubt not\r\nbut you will reward that invention which found out the only expedient\r\nto make your Lordship, or your Worship, of any consideration.\"\r\n\r\nHad I the honour to be in a libel, and had escaped the approbation of\r\nthe author, I should look upon it exactly in this manner. But though\r\nit is a thing thus perfectly indifferent, who is exalted or debased in\r\nsuch performances, yet it is not so with relation to the authors of\r\nthem; therefore I shall, for the good of my country, hereafter take\r\nupon me to punish these wretches. What is already passed, may die\r\naway according to its nature, and continue in its present oblivion;\r\nbut for the future, I shall take notice of such enemies to honour and\r\nvirtue, and preserve them to immortal infamy. Their names shall give\r\nfresh offence many ages hence, and be detested a thousand years after\r\nthe commission of their crime. It shall not avail, that these children\r\nof infamy publish their works under feigned names, or under none at\r\nall; for I am so perfectly well acquainted with the styles of all my\r\ncontemporaries, that I shall not fail of doing them justice, with their\r\nproper names, and at their full length. Let therefore these miscreants\r\nenjoy their present act of oblivion, and take care how they offend\r\nhereafter. But to avert our eyes from such objects, it is methinks but\r\nrequisite to settle our opinion in the case of praise and blame; and\r\nI believe, the only true way to cure that sensibility of reproach,\r\nwhich is a common weakness with the most virtuous men, is to fix their\r\nregard firmly upon only what is strictly true, in relation to their\r\nadvantage, as well as diminution. For if I am pleased with commendation\r\nwhich I do not deserve, I shall from the same temper be concerned at\r\nscandal I do not deserve. But he that can think of false applause with\r\nas much contempt as false detraction, will certainly be prepared for\r\nall adventures, and will become all occasions. Undeserved praise can\r\nplease only those who want merit, and undeserved reproach frighten\r\nonly those who want sincerity.[274] I have thought of this with so\r\nmuch attention, that I fancy there can be no other method in nature\r\nfound for the cure of that delicacy which gives good men pain under\r\ncalumny, but placing satisfaction nowhere but in a just sense of their\r\nown integrity, without regard to the opinion of others. If we have not\r\nsuch a foundation as this, there is no help against scandal, but being\r\nin obscurity, which to noble minds is not being at all. The truth of\r\nit is, this love of praise dwells most in great and heroic spirits;\r\nand those who best deserve it have generally the most exquisite relish\r\nof it. Methinks I see the renowned Alexander, after a painful and\r\nlaborious march, amidst the heats of a parched soil and a burning\r\nclimate, sitting over the head of a fountain, and after a draught of\r\nwater, pronounce that memorable saying, \"O Athenians! how much do I\r\nsuffer that you may speak well of me?\" The Athenians were at that time\r\nthe learned of the world, and their libels against Alexander were\r\nwritten as he was a professed enemy of their state: but how monstrous\r\nwould such invectives have appeared in Macedonians?\r\n\r\nAs love of reputation is a darling passion in great men, so the defence\r\nof them in this particular is the business of every man of honour and\r\nhonesty. We should run on such an occasion (as if a public building was\r\non fire) to their relief; and all who spread or publish such detestable\r\npieces as traduce their merit, should be used like incendiaries. It is\r\nthe common cause of our country, to support the reputation of those who\r\npreserve it against invaders; and every man is attacked in the person\r\nof that neighbour who deserves well of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Nov. 9._\r\n\r\nThe chat I had to-day at White's about fame and scandal, put me in mind\r\nof a person who has often written to me unregarded, and has a very\r\nmoderate ambition in this particular. His name it seems is Charles\r\nLillie, and he recommends himself to my observation as one that sold\r\nsnuff next door to the Fountain Tavern, in the Strand, and was burnt\r\nout when he began to have a reputation in his way.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n     \"I suppose, through a hurry of business, you have either forgotten\r\n     me, or lost my last of this nature; which was, to beg the favour\r\n     of being advantageously exposed in your paper, chiefly for the\r\n     reputation of snuff. Be pleased to pardon this trouble, from,\r\n\r\n  \"Sir,\r\n  Your very humble Servant,\r\n  C. L.\r\n\r\n     \"I am a perfumer, at the corner of Beauford Buildings, in the\r\n     Strand.\"\r\n\r\nThis same Charles leaves it to me to say what I will of him, and I am\r\nnot a little pleased with the ingenuous manner of his address. Taking\r\nsnuff is what I have declared against; but as his Holiness the Pope\r\nallows whoring for the taxes raised by the ladies of pleasure, so I,\r\nto repair the loss of an unhappy trader, indulge all persons in that\r\ncustom who buy of Charles. There is something so particular in the\r\nrequest of the man, that I shall send for him before me, and believe\r\nI shall find he has a genius for baubles: if so, I shall, for aught I\r\nknow, at his shop, give licensed canes to those who are really lame,\r\nand tubes to those who are unfeignedly short-sighted; and forbid all\r\nothers to vend the same.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[272] The royal children were at one time punished by proxy.

It is, methinks, from the prevalence of this silly custom that\r\nthere is so little instruction in the conversation of our distant\r\nfriends; for which reason, during the whole course of my life, I have\r\ndesired my acquaintance, when they write to me, rather to say something\r\nwhich should make me wish myself with them, than make me compliments\r\nthat they wished themselves with me.

To\r\ndesire to know how Damon goes on with his courtship to Silvia, or how\r\nthe wine tastes at the Old Devil, are threadbare subjects, and cold\r\ntreats, which our absent friends might have given us without going out\r\nof town for them. A friend of mine who went to travel, used me far\r\notherwise; for he gave me a prospect of the place, or an account of the\r\npeople, from every country through which he passed. Among others which\r\nI was looking over this evening, I am not a little delighted with this\r\nwhich follows:[275]\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"I believe this is the first letter that was ever sent you from\r\n     the middle region, where I am at this present writing. Not\r\n     to keep you in suspense, it comes to you from the top of the\r\n     highest mountain in Switzerland, where I am now shivering among\r\n     the eternal frosts and snows. I can scarce forbear dating it in\r\n     December, though they call it the first of August at the bottom\r\n     of the mountain. I assure you, I can hardly keep my ink from\r\n     freezing in the middle of the dog-days. I am here entertained with\r\n     the prettiest variety of snow prospects that you can imagine, and\r\n     have several pits of it before me that are very near as old as the\r\n     mountain itself; for in this country it is as lasting as marble. I\r\n     am now upon a spot of it which they tell me fell about the reign\r\n     of Charlemagne or King Pepin. The inhabitants of the country are\r\n     as great curiosities as the country itself: they generally hire\r\n     themselves out in their youth, and if they are musket-proof till\r\n     about fifty, they bring home the money they have got, and the\r\n     limbs they have left, to pass the rest of their time among their\r\n     native mountains. One of the gentlemen of the place, who is come\r\n     off with the loss of an eye only, told me by way of boast, that\r\n     there were now seven wooden legs in his family; and that for these\r\n     four generations, there had not been one in his line that carried\r\n     a whole body with him to the grave. I believe you will think the\r\n     style of this letter a little extraordinary; but the 'Rehearsal'\r\n     will tell you, that people in clouds must not be confined to speak\r\n     sense;[276] and I hope we that are above them may claim the same\r\n     privilege. Wherever I am, I shall always be,\r\n\r\n  \"Sir,\r\n  Your most obedient,\r\n  Most humble Servant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI think they ought, in those parts where the materials are so easy\r\nto work, and at the same time so durable, when any one of their\r\nheroes comes home from the wars, to erect his statue in snow upon the\r\nmountains, there to remain from generation to generation. A gentleman\r\nwho is apt to expatiate upon any hint, took this occasion to deliver\r\nhis opinion upon our ordinary method of sending young gentlemen to\r\ntravel for their education. \"It is certain,\" said he, \"if gentlemen\r\ntravel at an age proper for them, during the course of their voyages,\r\ntheir accounts to their friends, and after their return, their\r\ndiscourses and conversations, will have in them something above what\r\nwe can meet with from those who have not had those advantages. At the\r\nsame time it is to be observed, that every temper and genius is not\r\nqualified for this way of improvement. Men may change their climate,\r\nbut they cannot their nature. A man that goes out a fool, cannot ride\r\nor sail himself into common-sense. Therefore let me but walk over\r\nLondon Bridge with a young man, and I'll tell you infallibly whether\r\ngoing over the Rialto at Venice will make him wiser. It is not to be\r\nimagined how many I have saved in my time from banishment, by letting\r\ntheir parents know they were good for nothing. But this is to be done\r\nwith much tenderness. There is my cousin Harry has a son, who is the\r\ndullest mortal that was ever born into our house. He had got his trunk\r\nand his books all packed up to be transported into foreign parts,\r\nfor no reason but because the boy never talked; and his father said\r\nhe wanted to know the world. I could not say to a fond parent, that\r\nthe boy was dull; but looked grave, and told him, the youth was very\r\nthoughtful, and I feared he might have some doubts about religion,\r\nwith which it was not proper to go into Roman Catholic countries. He\r\nis accordingly kept here till he declares himself upon some points,\r\nwhich I am sure he will never think of. By this means, I have prevented\r\nthe dishonour of having a fool of our house laughed at in all parts\r\nof Europe. He is now with his father upon his own estate, and he has\r\nsent to me to get him a wife, which I shall do with all convenient\r\nspeed; but it shall be such a one, whose good nature shall hide his\r\nfaults, and good sense supply them. The truth of it is, that race is of\r\nthe true British kind: they are of our country only; it hurts them to\r\ntransplant them, and they are destroyed if you pretend to improve them.\r\nMen of this solid make are not to be hurried up and down the world, for\r\n(if I may so speak) they are naturally at their wit's end; and it is an\r\nimpertinent part to disturb their repose, that they may give you only\r\na history of their bodily occurrences, which is all they are capable\r\nof observing. Harry had an elder brother who was tried in this way. I\r\nremember, all he could talk of at his return, was, that he had like to\r\nhave been drowned at such a place, he fell out of a chaise at another,\r\nhe had a better stomach when he moved northward than when he turned his\r\ncourse to the parts in the south, and so forth. It is therefore very\r\nmuch to be considered, what sense a person has of things when he is\r\nsetting out; and if he then knows none of his friends and acquaintance\r\nbut by their clothes and faces, it is my humble opinion that he stay at\r\nhome. His parents should take care to marry him, and see what they can\r\nget out of him that way; for there is a certain sort of men who are no\r\notherwise to be regarded, but as they descend from men of consequence,\r\nand may beget valuable successors. And if we consider, that men are to\r\nbe esteemed only as they are useful, while a stupid wretch is at the\r\nhead of a great family, we may say, the race is suspended, as properly\r\nas when it is all gone, we say, it is extinct.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Nov. 11._[277]\r\n\r\nI had several hints and advertisements from unknown hands, that some,\r\nwho are enemies to my labours, design to demand the fashionable way of\r\nsatisfaction for the disturbance my lucubrations have given them. I\r\nconfess, as things now stand, I don't know how to deny such inviters,\r\nand am preparing myself accordingly: I have bought pumps and foils,\r\nand am every morning practising in my chamber. My neighbour, the\r\ndancing-master, has demanded of me, why I take this liberty, since\r\nI would not allow it him?[278] But I answered, his was an act of an\r\nindifferent nature, and mine of necessity. My late treatises against\r\nduels have so far disobliged the fraternity of the noble science of\r\ndefence, that I can get none of them to show me as much as one pass.\r\nI am therefore obliged to learn by book, and have accordingly several\r\nvolumes, wherein all the postures are exactly delineated. I must\r\nconfess, I am shy of letting people see me at this exercise, because\r\nof my flannel waistcoat, and my spectacles, which I am forced to fix\r\non, the better to observe the posture of the enemy. I have upon my\r\nchamber walls, drawn at full length, the figures of all sorts of men,\r\nfrom eight feet to three feet two inches. Within this height I take it,\r\nthat all the fighting men of Great Britain are comprehended. But as\r\nI push, I make allowances for my being of a lank and spare body, and\r\nhave chalked out in every figure my own dimensions; for I scorn to rob\r\nany man of his life by taking advantage of his breadth: therefore I\r\npress purely in a line down from his nose, and take no more of him to\r\nassault than he has of me: for to speak impartially, if a lean fellow\r\nwounds a fat one in any part to the right or left, whether it be in\r\ncarte or in tierce, beyond the dimensions of the said lean fellow's\r\nown breadth, I take it to be murder, and such a murder as is below a\r\ngentleman to commit. As I am spare, I am also very tall, and behave\r\nmyself with relation to that advantage with the same punctilio; and I\r\nam ready to stoop or stand, according to the stature of my adversary. I\r\nmust confess, I have had great success this morning, and have hit every\r\nfigure round the room in a mortal part, without receiving the least\r\nhurt, except a little scratch by falling on my face, in pushing at one\r\nat the lower end of my chamber; but I recovered so quick, and jumped so\r\nnimbly into my guard, that if he had been alive he could not have hurt\r\nme. It is confessed, I have written against duels with some warmth; but\r\nin all my discourses, I have not ever said, that I knew how a gentleman\r\ncould avoid a duel if he were provoked to it; and since that custom is\r\nnow become a law, I know nothing but the legislative power, with new\r\nanimadversions upon it, can put us in a capacity of denying challenges,\r\nthough we are afterwards hanged for it. But no more of this at present.\r\nAs things stand, I shall put up no more affronts; and I shall be so\r\nfar from taking ill words, that I will not take ill looks. I therefore\r\nwarn all young hot fellows, not to look hereafter more terrible than\r\ntheir neighbours; for if they stare at me with their hats cocked higher\r\nthan other people, I won't bear it. Nay, I give warning to all people\r\nin general to look kindly at me; for I'll bear no frowns, even from\r\nladies; and if any woman pretends to look scornfully at me, I shall\r\ndemand satisfaction of the next of kin of the masculine gender.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[275] This letter is by Addison.\r\n\r\n[276] \"_Smith._ Well; but methinks the sense of this song is not very\r\nplain.\r\n\r\n\"_Bayes._ Plain!

As this has\r\na very great effect even upon the most slow and common men; so, upon\r\nsuch as it finds qualified with virtue and merit, it shines out in\r\nproportionable degrees of excellence: it gives new grace to the most\r\neminent accomplishments; and he who of himself has either wit, wisdom,\r\nor valour, exerts each of these noble endowments when he becomes a\r\nlover, with a certain beauty of action above what was ever observed in\r\nhim before; and all who are without any one of these qualities, are\r\nto be looked upon as the rabble of mankind. I was talking after this\r\nmanner in a corner of this place with an old acquaintance, who, taking\r\nme by the hand, said, \"Mr. Bickerstaff, your discourse recalls to my\r\nmind a story, which I have longed to tell you ever since I read that\r\narticle wherein you desire your friends to give you accounts of obscure\r\nmerit.\" The story I had of him is literally true, and well known to\r\nbe so in the country wherein the circumstances were transacted. He\r\nacquainted me with the names of the persons concerned, which I shall\r\nchange into feigned ones, there being a respect due to their families,\r\nthat are still in being, as well as that the names themselves would\r\nnot be so familiar to an English ear. The adventure really happened in\r\nDenmark; and if I can remember all the circumstances, I doubt not but\r\nit will be as moving to my readers as it was to me.\r\n\r\nClarinda and Chloe, two very fine women, were bred up as sisters in\r\nthe family of Romeo, who was the father of Chloe, and the guardian of\r\nClarinda. Philander, a young gentleman of a good person and charming\r\nconversation, being a friend of old Romeo's, frequented his house,\r\nand by that means was much in conversation with the young ladies,\r\nthough still in the presence of the father and the guardian. The\r\nladies both entertained a secret passion for him, and could see well\r\nenough, notwithstanding the delight which he really took in Romeo's\r\nconversation, that there was something more in his heart which made\r\nhim so assiduous a visitant. Each of them thought herself the happy\r\nwoman; but the person beloved was Chloe. It happened that both of them\r\nwere at a play on a carnival evening, when it is the fashion there\r\n(as well as in most countries of Europe) both for men and women to\r\nappear in masks and disguises. It was on that memorable night in the\r\nyear 1679, when the play-house, by some unhappy accident, was set on\r\nfire.[279] Philander, in the first hurry of the disaster, immediately\r\nran where his treasure was, burst open the door of the box, snatched\r\nthe lady up in his arms, and with unspeakable resolution and good\r\nfortune carried her off safe. He was no sooner out of the crowd, but\r\nhe set her down; and grasping her in his arms, with all the raptures\r\nof a deserving lover, \"How happy am I,\" says he, \"in an opportunity\r\nto tell you I love you more than all things, and of showing you the\r\nsincerity of my passion at the very first declaration of it.\" \"My\r\ndear, dear Philander,\" says the lady, pulling off her mask, \"this is\r\nnot a time for art; you are much dearer to me than the life you have\r\npreserved: and the joy of my present deliverance does not transport me\r\nso much as the passion which occasioned it.\" Who can tell the grief,\r\nthe astonishment, the terror, that appeared in the face of Philander,\r\nwhen he saw the person he spoke to was Clarinda. After a short pause,\r\n\"Madam,\" says he, with the looks of a dead man, \"we are both mistaken;\"\r\nand immediately flew away, without hearing the distressed Clarinda, who\r\nhad just strength enough to cry out, \"Cruel Philander! why did you not\r\nleave me in the theatre?\" Crowds of people immediately gathered about\r\nher, and after having brought her to herself, conveyed her to the house\r\nof the good old unhappy Romeo. Philander was now pressing against a\r\nwhole tide of people at the doors of the theatre, and striving to enter\r\nwith more earnestness than any there endeavoured to get out. He did it\r\nat last, and with much difficulty forced his way to the box where his\r\nbeloved Chloe stood, expecting her fate amidst this scene of terror and\r\ndistraction.\r\n\r\nShe revived at the sight of Philander, who fell about her neck with\r\na tenderness not to be expressed; and amidst a thousand sobs and\r\nsighs, told her his love, and his dreadful mistake. The stage was now\r\nin flames, and the whole house full of smoke; the entrance was quite\r\nbarred up with heaps of people, who had fallen upon one another as they\r\nendeavoured to get out; swords were drawn, shrieks heard on all sides;\r\nand, in short, no possibility of an escape for Philander himself,\r\nhad he been capable of making it without his Chloe. But his mind was\r\nabove such a thought, and wholly employed in weeping, condoling, and\r\ncomforting. He catches her in his arms. The fire surrounds them,\r\nwhile--I cannot go on.\r\n\r\nWere I an infidel, misfortunes like this would convince me, that there\r\nmust be an hereafter: for who can believe that so much virtue could\r\nmeet with so great distress without a following reward. As for my\r\npart, I am so old-fashioned as firmly to believe that all who perish\r\nin such generous enterprises are relieved from the further exercise of\r\nlife; and Providence, which sees their virtue consummate and manifest,\r\ntakes them to an immediate reward, in a being more suitable to the\r\ngrandeur of their spirits. What else can wipe away our tears, when we\r\ncontemplate such undeserved, such irreparable distresses? It was a\r\nsublime thought in some of the heathens of old:\r\n\r\n            ----_Quæ gratia currûm\r\n    Armorumque fuit vivis, quæ cura nitentes\r\n    Pascere equos, eadem sequitur tellure repôstos._[280]\r\n\r\nThat is in other words, the same employments and inclinations which\r\nwere the entertainment of virtuous men upon earth, make up their\r\nhappiness in Elysium.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Nov. 14._\r\n\r\nWhen I came home this evening, I found a present from Mr. Charles\r\nLillie, the perfumer at the corner of Beauford Buildings, with a letter\r\nof thanks for the mention I made of him.[281] He tells me, several\r\nof my gentle readers have obliged me in buying at his shop upon my\r\nrecommendation. I have inquired into the man's capacity, and find\r\nhim an adept in his way. He has several helps to discourse besides\r\nsnuff (which is the best Barcelona), and sells an orange-flower\r\nwater, which seems to me to have in it the right spirit of brains;\r\nand I am informed, he extracts it according to the manner used in\r\nGresham College.[282] I recommend it to the handkerchiefs of all young\r\npleaders: it cures or supplies all pauses and hesitations in speech,\r\nand creates a general alacrity of the spirit. When it is used as a\r\ngargle, it gives volubility to the tongue, and never fails of that\r\nnecessary step towards pleasing others, making a man pleased with\r\nhimself. I have taken security of him, that he shall not raise the\r\nprice of any of his commodities for these or any other occult qualities\r\nin them; but he is to sell them at the same price which you give at the\r\ncommon perfumers. Mr. Lillie has brought further security, that he will\r\nnot sell the boxes made for politicians to lovers; nor on the contrary,\r\nthose proper for lovers to men of speculation: at this time, to avoid\r\nconfusion, the best orangery for beaus, and right musty for politicians.\r\n\r\nMy almanac is to be published on the 22nd; and from that instant, all\r\nlovers, in raptures or epistles, are to forbear the comparison of their\r\nmistresses' eyes to stars, I having made use of that simile in my\r\ndedication for the last time it shall ever pass, and on the properest\r\noccasion that it was ever employed. All ladies are hereby desired to\r\ntake notice, that they never receive that simile in payment for any\r\nsmiles they shall bestow for the future.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday night last, a gentlewoman's husband strayed from the\r\nplay-house in the Haymarket. If the lady who was seen to take him up,\r\nwill restore him, she shall be asked no questions, he being of no use\r\nbut to the owner.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[279] At this fire, on April 29, 1679, about two hundred persons were\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\n[280] \"Æneid,\" vi. 653.\r\n\r\n[281] See No. 92.\r\n\r\n[282] Where the Royal Society then met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 95.\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, Nov. 15_, to _Thursday, Nov. 17, 1709_.\r\n\r\n    Interea dulces pendent circum oscula nati;\r\n    Casta pudicitiam servat domus.\r\n\r\n  VIRG., Georg. ii. 523.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Nov. 16._\r\n\r\nThere are several persons who have many pleasures and entertainments in\r\ntheir possession which they do not enjoy. It is therefore a kind and\r\ngood office to acquaint them with their own happiness, and turn their\r\nattention to such instances of their good fortune which they are apt to\r\noverlook. Persons in the married state often want such a monitor, and\r\npine away their days, by looking upon the same condition in anguish and\r\nmurmur which carries with it in the opinion of others a complication of\r\nall the pleasures of life, and a retreat from its inquietudes. I am led\r\ninto this thought by a visit I made an old friend who was formerly my\r\nschoolfellow. He came to town last week with his family for the winter,\r\nand yesterday morning sent me word his wife expected me to dinner. I\r\nam as it were at home at that house, and every member of it knows me\r\nfor their well-wisher. I cannot indeed express the pleasure it is,\r\nto be met by the children with so much joy as I am when I go thither:\r\nthe boys and girls strive who shall come first, when they think it is\r\nI that am knocking at the door; and that child which loses the race to\r\nme, runs back again to tell the father it is Mr. Bickerstaff. This day\r\nI was led in by a pretty girl, that we all thought must have forgot\r\nme; for the family has been out of town these two years. Her knowing\r\nme again was a mighty subject with us, and took up our discourse at\r\nthe first entrance. After which they began to rally me upon a thousand\r\nlittle stories they heard in the country about my marriage to one of my\r\nneighbour's daughters: upon which the gentleman my friend said, \"Nay,\r\nif Mr. Bickerstaff marries a child of any of his old companions, I hope\r\nmine shall have the preference; there's Mrs. Mary is now sixteen, and\r\nwould make him as fine a widow as the best of them: but I know him too\r\nwell; he is so enamoured with the very memory of those who flourished\r\nin our youth, that he will not so much as look upon the modern\r\nbeauties. I remember, old gentleman, how often you went home in a day\r\nto refresh your countenance and dress, when Teraminta reigned in your\r\nheart. As we came up in the coach, I repeated to my wife some of your\r\nverses on her.\" With such reflections on little passages which happened\r\nlong ago, we passed our time during a cheerful and elegant meal. After\r\ndinner, his lady left the room, as did also the children. As soon as we\r\nwere alone, he took me by the hand; \"Well, my good friend,\" says he, \"I\r\nam heartily glad to see thee; I was afraid you would never have seen\r\nall the company that dined with you to-day again. Do not you think the\r\ngood woman of the house a little altered, since you followed her from\r\nthe play-house, to find out who she was, for me? I perceived a tear\r\nfall down his cheek as he spoke, which moved me not a little. But to\r\nturn the discourse,\" said I, \"She is not indeed quite that creature she\r\nwas when she returned me the letter I carried from you; and told me,\r\nshe hoped, as I was a gentleman, I would be employed no more to trouble\r\nher who had never offended me, but would be so much the gentleman's\r\nfriend as to dissuade him from a pursuit which he could never succeed\r\nin. You may remember, I thought her in earnest, and you were forced\r\nto employ your cousin Will, who made his sister get acquainted with\r\nher for you. You cannot expect her to be for ever fifteen.\" \"Fifteen?\"\r\nreplied my good friend: \"ah! you little understand, you that have\r\nlived a bachelor, how great, how exquisite a pleasure there is in\r\nbeing really beloved! It is impossible that the most beauteous face\r\nin nature should raise in me such pleasing ideas as when I look upon\r\nthat excellent woman. That fading in her countenance is chiefly caused\r\nby her watching with me in my fever. This was followed by a fit of\r\nsickness, which had like to have carried her off last winter. I tell\r\nyou sincerely, I have so many obligations to her, that I cannot with\r\nany sort of moderation think of her present state of health. But as\r\nto what you say of fifteen, she gives me every day pleasures beyond\r\nwhat I ever knew in the possession of her beauty when I was in the\r\nvigour of youth. Every moment of her life brings me fresh instances\r\nof her complacency to my inclinations, and her prudence in regard to\r\nmy fortune. Her face is to me much more beautiful than when I first\r\nsaw it; there is no decay in any feature which I cannot trace from the\r\nvery instant it was occasioned by some anxious concern for my welfare\r\nand interests. Thus at the same time, methinks, the love I conceived\r\ntowards her for what she was, is heightened by my gratitude for what\r\nshe is. The love of a wife is as much above the idle passion commonly\r\ncalled by that name, as the loud laughter of buffoons is inferior to\r\nthe elegant mirth of gentlemen. Oh! she is an inestimable jewel. In her\r\nexamination of her household affairs, she shows a certain fearfulness\r\nto find a fault, which makes her servants obey her like children; and\r\nthe meanest we have, has an ingenuous shame for an offence, not always\r\nto be seen in children in other families. I speak freely to you, my\r\nold friend; ever since her sickness, things that gave me the quickest\r\njoy before, turn now to a certain anxiety. As the children play in the\r\nnext room, I know the poor things by their steps, and am considering\r\nwhat they must do, should they lose their mother in their tender years.\r\nThe pleasure I used to take in telling my boy stories of the battles,\r\nand asking my girl questions about the disposal of her baby,[283] and\r\nthe gossiping of it, is turned into inward reflection and melancholy.\"\r\nHe would have gone on in this tender way, when the good lady entered,\r\nand with an inexpressible sweetness in her countenance told us, she\r\nhad been searching her closet for something very good to treat such an\r\nold friend as I was. Her husband's eyes sparkled with pleasure at the\r\ncheerfulness of her countenance; and I saw all his fears vanish in an\r\ninstant. The lady observing something in our looks which showed we had\r\nbeen more serious than ordinary, and seeing her husband receive her\r\nwith great concern under a forced cheerfulness, immediately guessed at\r\nwhat we had been talking of; and applying herself to me, said, with a\r\nsmile, \"Mr. Bickerstaff, don't believe a word of what he tells you. I\r\nshall still live to have you for my second, as I have often promised\r\nyou, unless he takes more care of himself than he has done since his\r\ncoming to town. You must know, he tells me, that he finds London is\r\na much more healthy place than the country; for he sees several of\r\nhis old acquaintance and school-fellows are here, young fellows with\r\nfair[284] full-bottomed periwigs. I could scarce keep him this morning\r\nfrom going out open-breasted.\"[285] My friend, who is always extremely\r\ndelighted with her agreeable humour, made her sit down with us. She did\r\nit with that easiness which is peculiar to women of sense; and to keep\r\nup the good humour she had brought in with her, turned her raillery\r\nupon me. \"Mr. Bickerstaff, you remember you followed me one night\r\nfrom the play-house; supposing you should carry me thither to-morrow\r\nnight, and lead me into the front box.\" This put us into a long field\r\nof discourse about the beauties, who were mothers to the present,\r\nand shone in the boxes twenty years ago. I told her, I was glad she\r\nhad transferred so many of her charms, and I did not question but\r\nher eldest daughter was within half a year of being a toast.[286] We\r\nwere pleasing ourselves with this fantastical preferment of the young\r\nlady, when on a sudden we were alarmed with the noise of a drum, and\r\nimmediately entered my little godson to give me a point of war.[287]\r\nHis mother, between laughing and chiding, would have put him out of the\r\nroom; but I would not part with him so.[288] I found, upon conversation\r\nwith him, though he was a little noisy in his mirth, that the child\r\nhad excellent parts, and was a great master of all the learning on the\r\nother side eight years old. I perceived him a very great historian in\r\nÆsop's fables; but he frankly declared to me his mind, that he did\r\nnot delight in that learning, because he did not believe they were\r\ntrue; for which reason, I found he had very much turned his studies,\r\nfor about a twelvemonth past, into the lives and adventures of Don\r\nBellianis of Greece, Guy of Warwick, the Seven Champions, and other\r\nhistorians of that age. I could not but observe the satisfaction the\r\nfather took in the forwardness of his son; and that these diversions\r\nmight turn to some profit, I found the boy had made remarks, which\r\nmight be of service to him during the course of his whole life. He\r\nwould tell you the mismanagements of John Hickathrift,[289] find fault\r\nwith the passionate temper in Bevis of Southampton, and loved St.\r\nGeorge for being the champion of England; and by this means, had his\r\nthoughts insensibly moulded into the notions of discretion, virtue, and\r\nhonour. I was extolling his accomplishments, when the mother told me,\r\nthat the little girl who led me in this morning was in her way a better\r\nscholar than he. \"Betty,\" says she, \"deals chiefly in fairies and\r\nsprites; and sometimes in a winter night, will terrify the maids with\r\nher accounts, till they are afraid to go up to bed.\"\r\n\r\nI sat with them till it was very late, sometimes in merry, sometimes\r\nin serious discourse, with this particular pleasure, which gives the\r\nonly true relish to all conversation, a sense that every one of us\r\nliked each other. I went home, considering the different conditions of\r\na married life and that of a bachelor; and I must confess, it struck\r\nme with a secret concern, to reflect, that whenever I go off, I shall\r\nleave no traces behind me. In this pensive mood I returned to my\r\nfamily; that is to say, to my maid, my dog and my cat, who only can be\r\nthe better or worse for what happens to me.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[283] Her doll. _Cf._ \"Wentworth Papers,\" p. 451, where Lady Anne\r\nWentworth, aged eight, writing to her father of a younger sister, says,\r\n\"Lady Hariote desires you to bring her a baby.\" The best dolls were\r\ncalled \"Bartholomew babies,\" says Professor Henry Morley (\"Memoirs of\r\nBartholomew Fair,\" 1859, p. 333).\r\n\r\nA passage in Sir Philip Sidney's \"Arcadia\" (Book III.) aptly\r\nillustrates this use of the word \"baby\": \"We see young babes think\r\nbabies of wonderful excellency, and yet the babies are but babies.\"\r\nFrom the private account-book of Isabella, Duchess of Grafton, who\r\nmarried, as her second husband, Sir T.

[ADDISON.[290]\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, Nov. 17_, to _Saturday, Nov. 19, 1709_.\r\n\r\n    Is demum mihi vivere atque frui animâ videtur, qui aliquo\r\n        negotio intentus, præclari facinoris, aut artis bonæ famam\r\n        quærit.--SALLUST, Bel. Cat. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Nov. 17._\r\n\r\nIt has cost me very much care and thought to marshal and fix the people\r\nunder their proper denominations, and to range them according to their\r\nrespective characters. These my endeavours have been received with\r\nunexpected success in one kind, but neglected in another; for though\r\nI have many readers, I have but few converts. This must certainly\r\nproceed from a false opinion, that what I write is designed rather\r\nto amuse and entertain than convince and instruct. I entered upon my\r\nessays with a declaration, that I should consider mankind in quite\r\nanother manner than they had hitherto been represented to the ordinary\r\nworld; and asserted, that none but a useful life should be with me\r\nany life at all. But lest this doctrine should have made this small\r\nprogress towards the conviction of mankind because it may appear to\r\nthe unlearned light and whimsical, I must take leave to unfold the\r\nwisdom and antiquity of my first proposition in these my essays, to\r\nwit, that every worthless man is a dead man. This notion is as old as\r\nPythagoras, in whose school it was a point of discipline, that if among\r\nthe #akoustikoi#, or probationers, there were any who grew weary\r\nof studying to be useful, and returned to an idle life, the rest were\r\nto regard them as dead; and upon their departing, to perform their\r\nobsequies, and raise them tombs, with inscriptions, to warn others of\r\nthe like mortality, and quicken them to resolutions of refining their\r\nsouls above that wretched state. It is upon a like supposition that\r\nyoung ladies at this very time in Roman Catholic countries are received\r\ninto some nunneries with their coffins, and with the pomp of a formal\r\nfuneral, to signify, that henceforth they are to be of no further use,\r\nand consequently dead. Nor was Pythagoras himself the first author\r\nof this symbol, with whom, and with the Hebrews, it was generally\r\nreceived. Much more might be offered in illustration of this doctrine\r\nfrom sacred authority, which I recommend to my reader's own reflection;\r\nwho will easily recollect, from places which I do not think fit to\r\nquote here, the forcible manner of applying the words dead and living\r\nto men as they are good or bad.\r\n\r\nI have therefore composed the following scheme of existence for the\r\nbenefit both of the living and the dead, though chiefly for the\r\nlatter, whom I must desire to read it with all possible attention.\r\nIn the number of the dead, I comprehend all persons of what title or\r\ndignity soever, who bestow most of their time in eating and drinking,\r\nto support that imaginary existence of theirs, which they call life;\r\nor in dressing and adorning those shadows and apparitions which are\r\nlooked upon by the vulgar as real men and women. In short, whoever\r\nresides in the world without having any business in it, and passes\r\naway an age without ever thinking on the errand for which he was sent\r\nhither, is to me a dead man to all intents and purposes; and I desire\r\nthat he may be so reputed. The living are only those that are some way\r\nor other laudably employed in the improvement of their own minds,\r\nor for the advantage of others; and even among these, I shall only\r\nreckon into their lives that part of their time which has been spent\r\nin the manner above mentioned. By these means, I am afraid, we shall\r\nfind the longest lives not to consist of many months, and the greatest\r\npart of the earth to be quite unpeopled. According to this system we\r\nmay observe, that some men are born at twenty years of age, some at\r\nthirty, some at threescore, and some not above an hour before they die;\r\nnay, we may observe multitudes that die without ever being born, as\r\nwell as many dead persons that fill up the bulk of mankind, and make\r\na better figure in the eyes of the ignorant than those who are alive\r\nand in their proper and full state of health. However, since there may\r\nbe many good subjects, that pay their taxes, and live peaceably in\r\ntheir habitations, who are not yet born, or have departed this life\r\nseveral years since, my design is to encourage both to join themselves\r\nas soon as possible to the number of the living: for as I invite the\r\nformer to break forth into being, and become good for something; so I\r\nallow the latter a state of resuscitation; which I chiefly mention for\r\nthe sake of a person who has lately published an advertisement, with\r\nseveral scurrilous terms in it, that do by no means become a dead man\r\nto give. It is my departed friend John Partridge, who concludes the\r\nadvertisement of his next year's almanac[291] with the following note:\r\n\r\n     \"Whereas it has been industriously given out by Bickerstaff, Esq.,\r\n     and others, to prevent the sale of this year's almanac, that John\r\n     Partridge is dead: this may inform all his loving countrymen, that\r\n     he is still living, in health, and they are knaves that reported\r\n     it otherwise.\r\n\r\n  \"J. P.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Nov. 18._\r\n\r\nWhen an engineer finds his guns have not had their intended effect, he\r\nchanges his batteries. I am forced at present to take this method; and\r\ninstead of continuing to write against the singularity some are guilty\r\nof in their habit and behaviour, I shall henceforward desire them to\r\npersevere in it; and not only so, but shall take it as a favour of all\r\nthe coxcombs in the town, if they will set marks upon themselves, and\r\nby some particular in their dress, show to what class they belong.\r\nIt would be very obliging in all such persons, who feel in themselves\r\nthat they are not sound of understanding, to give the world notice of\r\nit, and spare mankind the pains of finding them out. A cane upon the\r\nfifth button[292] shall from henceforth be the type of a Dapper;[293]\r\nred-heeled shoes, and a hat hung upon one side of the head, shall\r\nsignify a Smart;[294] a good periwig made into a twist, with a brisk\r\ncock, shall speak a mettled fellow; and an upper lip covered with\r\nsnuff, denotes a coffee-house statesman. But as it is required that\r\nall coxcombs hang out their signs, it is on the other hand expected,\r\nthat men of real merit should avoid anything particular in their dress,\r\ngait, or behaviour. For, as we old men delight in proverbs, I cannot\r\nforbear bringing out one on this occasion, that \"good wine needs no\r\nbush.\"[295] I must not leave this subject without reflecting on several\r\npersons I have lately met with, who at a distance seem very terrible;\r\nbut upon a stricter inquiry into their looks and features, appeared\r\nas meek and harmless as any of my own neighbours. These are country\r\ngentlemen, who of late years have taken up a humour of coming to town\r\nin red coats, whom an arch wag of my acquaintance used to describe very\r\nwell, by calling them sheep in wolves' clothing. I have often wondered,\r\nthat honest gentlemen, who are good neighbours, and live quietly in\r\ntheir own possessions, should take it in their heads to frighten the\r\ntown after this unreasonable manner. I shall think myself obliged, if\r\nthey persist in so unnatural a dress (notwithstanding any posts they\r\nmay have in the militia), to give away their red coats to any of the\r\nsoldiery who shall think fit to strip them, provided the said soldiers\r\ncan make it appear, that they belong to a regiment where there is a\r\ndeficiency in the clothing.\r\n\r\nAbout two days ago I was walking in the Park, and accidentally met a\r\nrural squire, clothed in all the types above mentioned, with a carriage\r\nand behaviour made entirely out of his own head. He was of a bulk and\r\nstature larger than ordinary, had a red coat, flung open to show a\r\ngay calamanco[296] waistcoat: his periwig fell in a very considerable\r\nbush upon each shoulder: his arms naturally swung at an unreasonable\r\ndistance from his sides; which, with the advantage of a cane, that he\r\nbrandished in a great variety of irregular motions, made it unsafe for\r\nany one to walk within several yards of him. In this manner he took up\r\nthe whole Mall, his spectators moving on each side of it, whilst he\r\ncocked up his hat, and marched directly for Westminster. I cannot tell\r\nwho this gentleman is, but for my comfort may say, with the lover in\r\nTerence, who lost sight of a fine young lady, \"Wherever thou art, thou\r\ncanst not be long concealed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. James's Coffee-house, Nov. 18._\r\n\r\nBy letters from Paris of the 16th we are informed, that the French\r\nKing, the princes of the blood, and the Elector of Bavaria had lately\r\nkilled fifty-five pheasants.\r\n\r\n     Whereas several have industriously spread abroad, that I am in\r\n     partnership with Charles Lillie, the perfumer at the corner of\r\n     Beauford Buildings; I must say with my friend Partridge, that they\r\n     are knaves who reported it. However, since the said Charles has\r\n     promised that all his customers shall be mine, I must desire all\r\n     mine to be his; and dare answer for him, that if you ask in my\r\n     name for snuff, Hungary or orange-water, you shall have the best\r\n     the town affords at the cheapest rate.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[290] Nichols ascribes this paper to Addison, upon the evidence of MS.\r\nnotes of Christopher Byron, who assisted Zachary Grey in his edition of\r\n\"Hudibras.\" This is probably right, but the paper is not included in\r\nTickell's edition of Addison's works.\r\n\r\n[291] The \"Partridge's Almanac\" for 1710 was brought out by the\r\nStationers' Company, and not by Partridge. The following advertisement\r\nappeared in No. 105 of the _Tatler_: \"There having of late in several\r\nnewspapers been an advertisement of an almanac called _Merlinus\r\nLiberatus_, pretended to be made by J. Partridge, but in truth was\r\npatched together by Benjamin Harris, famous for practices of this\r\nnature, this notice is given, to prevent persons from being imposed\r\nupon; for there will not be any almanac published by J. Partridge for\r\nthe year 1710, the injunction granted by the Lord High Chancellor\r\nagainst printing the same being still in force; and if any person shall\r\ndeal in any counterfeit almanacs, they will be proceeded against.\"\r\n\r\nAs Partridge is often mentioned in the _Tatler_ (see Nos. 1, 7, 11, 56,\r\n59, 67, 99, 216, 228, 240), it may be well to give some particulars\r\nof him in addition to what is stated in the Introduction. Partridge\r\nwas born at East Sheen in 1644, and was apprenticed to a shoemaker;\r\nbut he studied assiduously, and, giving up his trade, began to publish\r\nastrological books in 1678. His almanac, _Merlinus Liberatus_, appeared\r\nfirst in 1680, and in 1682 he described himself as sworn physician\r\nto Charles II. Afterwards he went to Leyden, and claimed to have\r\nreceived the degree of M. D. During the closing years of the century\r\nhe had controversies with other almanac makers, and advertised quack\r\nmedicines. When Swift attacked him in 1708 he was rightly regarded as\r\nbeing at the head of his profession. For a time he was silenced; no\r\nalmanac appeared from 1710 to 1713; but his _Merlinus Redivivus_ was\r\nissued in 1714, with an attack upon Swift. Partridge died at Mortlake\r\nin 1715, and a monument to his memory was erected in the churchyard.\r\nHis will shows that he left property amounting to over £2000. It is\r\nsaid that his real name was Hewson.\r\n\r\n[292] See No. 26.\r\n\r\n[293] See No. 85.\r\n\r\n[294] See No. 26.\r\n\r\n[295] An ivy-bush often formed the sign of a tavern.

[ADDISON.\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, Nov. 19_, to _Tuesday, Nov. 22, 1709_.\r\n\r\n    Illud maxime rarum genus est eorum, qui aut excellente ingenii\r\n        magnitudine, aut præclara erudidione atque doctrina, aut\r\n        utraque re ornati, spatium deliberandi habuerunt, quem\r\n        potissimum vitæ cursum sequi vellent.--CICERO, De Offic. I.\r\n        xxxiii. 119.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Nov. 21._\r\n\r\nHaving swept away prodigious multitudes in my last paper, and brought\r\na great destruction upon my own species, I must endeavour in this to\r\nraise fresh recruits, and, if possible, to supply the places of the\r\nunborn and the deceased. It is said of Xerxes, that when he stood upon\r\na hill, and saw the whole country round him covered with his army, he\r\nburst out in tears, to think that not one of that multitude would be\r\nalive a hundred years after. For my part, when I take a survey of this\r\npopulous city, I can scarce forbear weeping, to see how few of its\r\ninhabitants are now living. It was with this thought that I drew up\r\nmy last bill of mortality, and endeavoured to set out in it the great\r\nnumber of persons who have perished by a distemper (commonly known by\r\nthe name of Idleness) which has long raged in the world, and destroys\r\nmore in every great town than the plague has done at Dantzic.[297] To\r\nrepair the mischief it has done, and stock the world with a better race\r\nof mortals, I have more hopes of bringing to life those that are young,\r\nthan of reviving those that are old. For which reason, I shall here\r\nset down that noble allegory which was written by an old author called\r\nProdicus, but recommended and embellished by Socrates.[298] It is the\r\ndescription of Virtue and Pleasure making their court to Hercules under\r\nthe appearances of two beautiful women.\r\n\r\nWhen Hercules, says the divine moralist, was in that part of his youth\r\nin which it was natural for him to consider what course of life he\r\nought to pursue, he one day retired into a desert, where the silence\r\nand solitude of the place very much favoured his meditations. As he was\r\nmusing on his present condition, and very much perplexed in himself\r\non the state of life he should choose, he saw two women of a larger\r\nstature than ordinary approaching towards him. One of them had a very\r\nnoble air and graceful deportment; her beauty was natural and easy,\r\nher person clean and unspotted, her eyes cast towards the ground with\r\nan agreeable reserve, her motion and behaviour full of modesty, and\r\nher raiment as white as snow. The other had a great deal of health and\r\nfloridness in her countenance, which she had helped with an artificial\r\nwhite and red, and endeavoured to appear more graceful than ordinary in\r\nher mien, by a mixture of affectation in all her gestures. She had a\r\nwonderful confidence and assurance in her looks, and all the variety of\r\ncolours in her dress that she thought were the most proper to show her\r\ncomplexion to an advantage.\r\n\r\nShe cast her eyes upon herself, then turned them on those that were\r\npresent, to see how they liked her, and often looked on the figure\r\nshe made in her own shadow. Upon her nearer approach to Hercules, she\r\nstepped before the other lady (who came forward with a regular composed\r\ncarriage), and running up to him, accosted him after the following\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\n\"My dear Hercules,\" says she, \"I find you are very much divided in\r\nyour own thoughts upon the way of life that you ought to choose: be my\r\nfriend, and follow me; I'll lead you into the possession of pleasure,\r\nand out of the reach of pain, and remove you from all the noise and\r\ndisquietude of business. The affairs of either war or peace shall have\r\nno power to disturb you. Your whole employment shall be to make your\r\nlife easy, and to entertain every sense with its proper gratification.\r\nSumptuous tables, beds of roses, clouds of perfumes, concerts of music,\r\ncrowds of beauties, are all in a readiness to receive you. Come along\r\nwith me into this region of delights, this world of pleasure, and bid\r\nfarewell for ever to care, to pain, to business.\"\r\n\r\nHercules hearing the lady talk after this manner, desired to know\r\nher name; to which she answered, \"My friends, and those who are well\r\nacquainted with me, call me Happiness; but my enemies, and those who\r\nwould injure my reputation, have given me the name of Pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the other lady was come up, who addressed herself to the\r\nyoung hero in a very different manner.\r\n\r\n\"Hercules,\" says she, \"I offer myself to you, because I know you are\r\ndescended from the gods, and give proofs of that descent by your love\r\nto virtue, and application to the studies proper for your age. This\r\nmakes me hope you will gain both for yourself and me an immortal\r\nreputation. But before I invite you into my society and friendship,\r\nI will be open and sincere with you, and must lay down this as an\r\nestablished truth, that there is nothing truly valuable which can be\r\npurchased without pains and labour.[299] The gods have set a price upon\r\nevery real and noble pleasure. If you would gain the favour of the\r\nDeity, you must be at the pains of worshipping him; if the friendship\r\nof good men, you must study to oblige them; if you would be honoured\r\nby your country, you must take care to serve it. In short, if you\r\nwould be eminent in war or peace, you must become master of all the\r\nqualifications that can make you so. These are the only terms and\r\nconditions upon which I can propose happiness.\" The goddess of Pleasure\r\nhere broke in upon her discourse: \"You see, \"said she, \"Hercules, by\r\nher own confession, the way to her pleasures is long and difficult,\r\nwhereas that which I propose is short and easy.\" \"Alas!\" said the other\r\nlady, whose visage glowed with a passion made up of scorn and pity,\r\n\"what are the pleasures you propose? To eat before you are hungry,\r\ndrink before you are athirst, sleep before you are tired, to gratify\r\nappetites before they are raised, and raise such appetites as Nature\r\nnever planted. You never heard the most delicious music, which is the\r\npraise of one's self; nor saw the most beautiful object, which is the\r\nwork of one's own hands. Your votaries pass away their youth in a dream\r\nof mistaken pleasures, while they are hoarding up anguish, torment, and\r\nremorse, for old age.\r\n\r\n\"As for me, I am the friend of gods and of good men, an agreeable\r\ncompanion to the artisan, a household guardian to the fathers of\r\nfamilies, a patron and protector of servants, an associate in all\r\ntrue and generous friendships. The banquets of my votaries are never\r\ncostly, but always delicious; for none eat or drink at them who are\r\nnot invited by hunger and thirst. Their slumbers are sound, and their\r\nwakings cheerful. My young men have the pleasure of hearing themselves\r\npraised by those who are in years, and those who are in years of being\r\nhonoured by those who are young. In a word, my followers are favoured\r\nby the gods, beloved by their acquaintance, esteemed by their country,\r\nand (after the close of their labours) honoured by posterity.\"\r\n\r\nWe know by the life of this memorable hero, to which of these two\r\nladies he gave up his heart; and I believe, every one who reads this\r\nwill do him the justice to approve his choice.\r\n\r\nI very much admire the speeches of these ladies, as containing in\r\nthem the chief arguments for a life of virtue or a life of pleasure\r\nthat could enter into the thoughts of a heathen; but am particularly\r\npleased with the different figures he gives the two goddesses. Our\r\nmodern authors have represented Pleasure or Vice with an alluring face,\r\nbut ending in snakes and monsters: here she appears in all the charms\r\nof beauty, though they are all false and borrowed; and by that means,\r\ncomposes a vision entirely natural and pleasing.\r\n\r\nI have translated this allegory for the benefit of the youth of Great\r\nBritain; and particularly of those who are still in the deplorable\r\nstate of non-existence, and whom I most earnestly entreat to come into\r\nthe world. Let my embryos show the least inclination to any single\r\nvirtue, and I shall allow it to be a struggling towards birth. I don't\r\nexpect of them, that, like the hero in the foregoing story, they should\r\ngo about as soon as they are born, with a club in their hands, and\r\na lion's skin on their shoulders, to root out monsters, and destroy\r\ntyrants; but as the finest author of all antiquity has said upon\r\nthis very occasion, though a man has not the abilities to distinguish\r\nhimself in the most shining parts of a great character, he has\r\ncertainly the capacity of being just, faithful, modest, and temperate.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[297] In 1709 the plague carried off over 40,000 persons in Dantzic.\r\n\r\n[298] See Xenophon, \"Mem.,\" Book II. chap. i. 21.\r\n\r\n[299] _Cf._ Hesiod, \"Works and Days,\" 289.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 98. [STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, Nov. 22_, to _Thursday, Nov. 24, 1709_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Nov. 23._\r\n\r\nI read the following letter, which was left for me this evening, with\r\nvery much concern for the lady's condition who sent it, who expresses\r\nthe state of her mind with great frankness, as all people ought who\r\ntalk to their physicians.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n     \"Though you are stricken in years, and have had great experience\r\n     in the world, I believe you will say, there are not frequently\r\n     such difficult occasions to act in with decency as those wherein\r\n     I am entangled. I am a woman in love, and that you will allow to\r\n     be the most unhappy of all circumstances in human life: Nature\r\n     has formed us with a strong reluctance against owning such a\r\n     passion, and custom has made it criminal in us to make advances.\r\n     A gentleman, whom I will call Fabio, has the entire possession of\r\n     my heart. I am so intimately acquainted with him, that he makes\r\n     no scruple of communicating to me an ardent affection he has for\r\n     Cleora, a friend of mine, who also makes me her confidante. Most\r\n     part of my life I am in company with the one or the other, and\r\n     am always entertained with his passion, or her triumph. Cleora\r\n     is one of those ladies, who think they are virtuous, if they are\r\n     not guilty; and without any delicacy of choice, resolves to take\r\n     the best offer which shall be made to her. With this prospect she\r\n     puts off declaring herself in favour of Fabio, till she sees what\r\n     lovers will fall into her snares, which she lays in all public\r\n     places with all the art of gesture and glances. This resolution\r\n     she has herself told me. Though I love him better than life, I\r\n     would not gain him by betraying Cleora, or committing such a\r\n     trespass against modesty as letting him know myself that I love\r\n     him. You are an astrologer, what shall I do?\r\n\r\n  \"DIANA DOUBTFUL.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis lady has said very justly, that the condition of a woman in love\r\nis of all others the most miserable. Poor Diana! how must she be racked\r\nwith jealousy when Fabio talks of Cleora? how with indignation when\r\nCleora makes a property of Fabio? A female lover is in the condition\r\nof a ghost, that wanders about its beloved treasure, without power\r\nto speak until it is spoken to. I desire Diana to continue in this\r\ncircumstance; for I see an eye of comfort in her case, and will take\r\nall proper measures to extricate her out of this unhappy game of\r\ncross purposes. Since Cleora is upon the catch with her charms, and\r\nhas no particular regard for Fabio, I shall place a couple of special\r\nfellows in her way, who shall both address to her, and have each a\r\nbetter estate than Fabio. They are both already taken with her, and\r\nare preparing for being of her retinue the ensuing winter. To women\r\nof this worldly turn, as I apprehend Cleora to be, we must reckon\r\nbackward in our computation of merit; and when a fair lady thinks only\r\nof making her spouse a convenient domestic, the notion of worth and\r\nvalue is altered, and the lover is the more acceptable the less he is\r\nconsiderable. The two I shall throw in the way of Cleora, are Orson\r\nThickett and Mr. Walter Wisdom. Orson is a huntsman, whose father's\r\ndeath, and some difficulties about legacies, brought out of the woods\r\nto town last November. He was at that time one of those country savages\r\nwho despise the softness they meet in town and court, and professedly\r\nshow their strength and roughness in every motion and gesture, in\r\nscorn of our bowing and cringing. He was at his first appearance very\r\nremarkable for that piece of good breeding peculiar to natural Britons,\r\nto wit, defiance. He showed every one he met he was as good a man as\r\nhe. But in the midst of all his fierceness, he would sometimes attend\r\nthe discourse of a man of sense, and look at the charms of a beauty\r\nwith his eyes and mouth open. He was in this posture when, in the\r\nbeginning of last December, he was shot by Cleora from a side-box.[300]\r\nFrom that moment he softened into humanity, forgot his dogs and horses,\r\nand now moves and speaks with civility and address. What Wisdom, by\r\nthe death of an elder brother, came to a great estate, when he had\r\nproceeded just far enough in his studies to be very impertinent, and at\r\nthe years when the law gives him possession of his fortune, and his own\r\nconstitution is too warm for the management of it. Orson is learning\r\nto fence and dance, to please and fight for his mistress; and Walter\r\npreparing fine horses, and a jingling chariot, to enchant her. All\r\npersons concerned will appear at the next opera, where will begin the\r\nwild-goose chase; and I doubt, Fabio will see himself so overlooked for\r\nOrson or Walter, as to turn his eyes on the modest passion and becoming\r\nlanguor in the countenance of Diana; it being my design to supply with\r\nthe art of love all those who preserve the sincere passion of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will's Coffee-house, Nov. 23._\r\n\r\nAn ingenious and worthy gentleman, my ancient friend,[301] fell into\r\ndiscourse with me this evening upon the force and efficacy which the\r\nwritings of good poets have on the minds of their intelligent readers,\r\nand recommended to me his sense of the matter, thrown together in the\r\nfollowing manner, which he desired me to communicate to the youth of\r\nGreat Britain in my essays; which I choose to do in his own words.\r\n\r\n\"I have always been of opinion,\" says he, \"that virtue sinks deepest\r\ninto the heart of man when it comes recommended by the powerful charms\r\nof poetry. The most active principle in our mind is the imagination:\r\nto it a good poet makes his court perpetually, and by this faculty\r\ntakes care to gain it first. Our passions and inclinations come over\r\nnext; and our reason surrenders itself with pleasure in the end. Thus\r\nthe whole soul is insensibly betrayed into morality, by bribing the\r\nfancy with beautiful and agreeable images of those very things that\r\nin the books of the philosophers appear austere, and have at the best\r\nbut a kind of forbidden aspect. In a word, the poets do, as it were,\r\nstrew the rough paths of virtue so full of flowers, that we are not\r\nsensible of the uneasiness of them, and imagine ourselves in the midst\r\nof pleasures, and the most bewitching allurements, at the time we are\r\nmaking a progress in the severest duties of life.\r\n\r\n\"All then agree, that licentious poems do of all writings soonest\r\ncorrupt the heart: and why should we not be as universally persuaded,\r\nthat the grave and serious performances of such as write in the\r\nmost engaging manner, by a kind of divine impulse, must be the most\r\neffectual persuasives to goodness? If therefore I were blessed with a\r\nson, in order to the forming of his manners (which is making him truly\r\nmy son) I should be continually putting into his hand some fine poet.\r\nThe graceful sentences and the manly sentiments so frequently to be met\r\nwith in every great and sublime writer, are, in my judgment, the most\r\nornamental and valuable furniture that can be for a young gentleman's\r\nhead; methinks they show like so much rich embroidery upon the brain.\r\nLet me add to this, that humanity and tenderness (without which there\r\ncan be no true greatness in the mind) are inspired by the Muses in such\r\npathetical language, that all we find in prose authors towards the\r\nraising and improving of these passions, is in comparison but cold, or\r\nlukewarm at the best. There is besides a certain elevation of soul, a\r\nsedate magnanimity, and a noble turn of virtue, that distinguishes the\r\nhero from the plain, honest man, to which verse can only raise us. The\r\nbold metaphors and sounding numbers, peculiar to the poets, rouse up\r\nall our sleeping faculties, and alarm the whole powers of the soul,\r\nmuch like that excellent trumpeter mentioned by Virgil:\r\n\r\n    '----_Quo non præstantior alter\r\n    Ære ciere viros, Martemque accendere cantu._'[302]\r\n\r\n\"I fell into this train of thinking this evening, upon reading\r\na passage in a masque written by Milton, where two brothers are\r\nintroduced seeking after their sister, whom they had lost in a dark\r\nnight and thick wood. One of the brothers is apprehensive lest the\r\nwandering virgin should be overpowered with fears through the darkness\r\nand loneliness of the time and place. This gives the other occasion to\r\nmake the following reflections, which, as I read them, made me forget\r\nmy age, and renewed in me the warm desires after virtue, so natural to\r\nuncorrupted youth.\r\n\r\n    '_I do not think my sister so to seek,\r\n    Or so unprincipled in virtue's book,\r\n    And the sweet peace that goodness bosoms ever,\r\n    As that the single want of light and noise\r\n    (Not being in danger, as I trust she is not)\r\n    Could stir the constant mood of her calm thoughts,\r\n    And put them into misbecoming plight.\r\n    Virtue could see to do what Virtue would,\r\n    By her own radiant light, though sun and moon\r\n    Were in the flat sea sunk. And Wisdom's self\r\n    Oft seeks to sweet retirèd solitude:\r\n    Where, with her best nurse, Contemplation,\r\n    She plumes her feathers, and lets grow her wings,\r\n    That in the various bustle of resort\r\n    Were all too ruffled, and sometimes impaired.\r\n    He that has light within his own clear breast,\r\n    May sit i' th' centre, and enjoy bright day:\r\n    But he that hides a dark soul, and foul thoughts,\r\n    Benighted walks under the mid-day sun;\r\n    Himself is his own dungeon._'\"[303]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[300] See No. 50.\r\n\r\n[301] Perhaps Dr. Thomas Walker, head schoolmaster at the Charter\r\nHouse, where Steele and Addison were scholars.

My old friends, Hart[304] and Mohun,[305] the one by his\r\nnatural and proper force, the other by his great skill and art, never\r\nfailed to send me home full of such ideas as affected my behaviour,\r\nand made me insensibly more courteous and humane to my friends and\r\nacquaintance. It is not the business of a good play to make every man a\r\nhero; but it certainly gives him a livelier sense of virtue and merit\r\nthan he had when he entered the theatre. This rational pleasure (as\r\nI always call it) has for many years been very little tasted; but I\r\nam glad to find, that the true spirit of it is reviving again amongst\r\nus, by a due regard to what is presented, and by supporting only one\r\nplay-house.[306] It has been within the observation of the youngest\r\namongst us, that while there were two houses, they did not outvie each\r\nother by such representations as tended to the instruction and ornament\r\nof life, but by introducing mimical dances and fulsome buffooneries.\r\nFor when an excellent tragedy was to be acted in one house, the\r\nladder-dancer[307] carried the whole town to the other: and indeed such\r\nan evil as this must be the natural consequence of two theatres, as\r\ncertainly as that there are more who can see than can think. Every one\r\nis judge of the danger of the fellow on the ladder, and his activity in\r\ncoming down safe; but very few are judges of the distress of a hero in\r\na play, or of his manner of behaviour in those circumstances. Thus, to\r\nplease the people, two houses must entertain them with what they can\r\nunderstand, and not with things which are designed to improve their\r\nunderstanding: and the readiest way to gain good audiences, must be to\r\noffer such things as are most relished by the crowd; that is to say,\r\nimmodest action, empty show, or impertinent activity. In short, two\r\nhouses cannot hope to subsist, but by means which are contradictory to\r\nthe very institution of a theatre in a well-governed kingdom.\r\n\r\nI have ever had this sense of the thing, and for that reason have\r\nrejoiced that my ancient coeval friend of Drury Lane,[308] though he\r\nhad sold off most of his movables, still kept possession of his palace,\r\nand trembled for him, when he had lately like to have been taken by\r\na stratagem. There have for many ages been a certain learned sort of\r\nunlearned men in this nation called attorneys, who have taken upon\r\nthem to solve all difficulties by increasing them, and are called upon\r\nto the assistance of all who are lazy, or weak of understanding. The\r\ninsolence of a ruler of this place made him resign the possession of it\r\nto the management of my above-mentioned friend Divito. Divito was too\r\nmodest to know when to resign it, till he had the opinion and sentence\r\nof the law for his removal. Both these in length of time were obtained\r\nagainst him: but as the great Archimedes defended Syracuse with so\r\npowerful engines, that if he threw a rope or piece of wood over the\r\nwall, the enemy fled; so Divito had wounded all adversaries with so\r\nmuch skill, that men feared even to be in the right against him. For\r\nthis reason, the lawful ruler sets up an attorney to expel an attorney,\r\nand chose a name dreadful to the stage,[309] who only seemed able to\r\nbeat Divito out of his entrenchments.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd instant, a night of public rejoicing, the enemies of\r\nDivito made a largess to the people of faggots, tubs, and other\r\ncombustible matter, which was erected into a bonfire before the palace.\r\nPlentiful cans were at the same time distributed among the dependencies\r\nof that principality; and the artful rival of Divito observing them\r\nprepared for enterprise, presented the lawful owner of the neighbouring\r\nedifice, and showed his deputation under him. War immediately ensued\r\nupon the peaceful empire of wit and the Muses; the Goths and Vandals\r\nsacking Rome did not threaten a more barbarous devastation of arts and\r\nsciences. But when they had forced their entrance, the experienced\r\nDivito had detached all his subjects, and evacuated all his stores. The\r\nneighbouring inhabitants report, that the refuse of Divito's followers\r\nmarched off the night before disguised in magnificence; door-keepers\r\ncame out clad like cardinals, and scene-drawers like heathen gods.\r\nDivito himself was wrapped up in one of his black clouds, and left to\r\nthe enemy nothing but an empty stage, full of trap-doors, known only to\r\nhimself and his adherents.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Nov. 25._\r\n\r\nI have already taken great pains to inspire notions of honour and\r\nvirtue into the people of this kingdom, and used all gentle methods\r\nimaginable, to bring those who are dead in idleness, folly, and\r\npleasure, into life, by applying themselves to learning, wisdom, and\r\nindustry. But since fair means are ineffectual, I must proceed to\r\nextremities, and shall give my good friends the Company of Upholders\r\nfull power to bury all such dead as they meet with, who are within my\r\nformer descriptions of deceased persons. In the meantime the following\r\nremonstrance of that corporation I take to be very just:\r\n\r\n\r\n_From our Office near the Haymarket, Nov. 23._\r\n\r\n     \"WORTHY SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"Upon reading your _Tatler_ of Saturday last,[310] by which we\r\n     received the agreeable news of so many deaths, we immediately\r\n     ordered in a considerable quantity of blacks; and our servants\r\n     have wrought night and day ever since, to furnish out the\r\n     necessaries for these deceased. But so it is, Sir, that of this\r\n     vast number of dead bodies, that go putrefying up and down the\r\n     streets, not one of them has come to us to be buried. Though\r\n     we should be both to be any hindrance to our good friends the\r\n     physicians, yet we cannot but take notice, what infection her\r\n     Majesty's subjects are liable to from the horrible stench of so\r\n     many corpses. Sir, we will not detain you; our case in short is\r\n     this: here are we embarked, in this undertaking for the public\r\n     good: now if people shall be suffered to go on unburied at\r\n     this rate, there's an end of the usefullest manufactures and\r\n     handicrafts of the kingdom: for where will be your sextons,\r\n     coffin-makers, and plumbers? What will become of your embalmers,\r\n     epitaph-mongers, and chief mourners? We are loth to drive this\r\n     matter any further, though we tremble at the consequences of it:\r\n     for if it shall be left to every dead man's discretion not to\r\n     be buried till he sees his time, no man can say where that will\r\n     end; but thus much we will take upon us to affirm, that such a\r\n     toleration will be intolerable.\r\n\r\n     \"What would make us easy in this matter, is no more but that your\r\n     Worship would be pleased to issue out your orders to ditto dead\r\n     to repair forthwith to our office, in order to their interment,\r\n     where constant attendance shall be given to treat with all persons\r\n     according to their quality, and the poor to be buried for\r\n     nothing; and for the convenience of such persons as are willing\r\n     enough to be dead, but that they are afraid their friends and\r\n     relations should know it, we have a back door into Warwick Street,\r\n     from whence they may be interred with all secrecy imaginable,\r\n     and without loss of time, or hindrance of business. But in case\r\n     of obstinacy (for we would gladly make a thorough riddance), we\r\n     desire a further power from your Worship, to take up such deceased\r\n     as shall not have complied with your first orders, wherever we\r\n     meet them; and if after that there shall be complaints of any\r\n     persons so offending, let them lie at our doors.--We are,\r\n\r\n  \"Your Worship's till death,\r\n  THE MASTER AND COMPANY OF UPHOLDERS.\r\n\r\n     \"_P.S._--We are ready to give in our printed proposals at large;\r\n     and if your Worship approves of our undertaking, we desire the\r\n     following advertisement may be inserted in your next paper:\r\n\r\n     \"Whereas a commission of interment has been awarded against Dr.\r\n     John Partridge,[311] philomath, professor of physic and astrology;\r\n     and whereas the said Partridge hath not surrendered himself,\r\n     nor shown cause to the contrary, these are to certify, that the\r\n     Company of Upholders will proceed to bury him from Cordwainers'\r\n     Hall, on Tuesday the 29th instant, where any six of his surviving\r\n     friends, who still believe him to be alive, are desired to come\r\n     prepared to hold up the pall.\r\n\r\n     \"_Note._--We shall light away at six in the evening, there being\r\n     to be a sermon.\" #/\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[303] \"Comus,\" 366.\r\n\r\n[304] Charles Hart, who died in 1683, was the creator of several\r\nimportant parts in plays by Wycherley, Dryden, and Lee. Hart and\r\nMohun were the principal members of Killigrew's company. Hart was the\r\ngrandson of Shakespeare's sister Joan, and Cibber mentions specially\r\nthe fame of his representation of Othello. See No. 138.\r\n\r\n[305] Michael Mohun, like Hart, fought on the side of Charles in the\r\nCivil War, and began his life as an actor by performing women's parts.\r\nHe generally played second to Hart. Gildon (\"Comparison between Two\r\nStages,\" 1702) says that plays were so well acted by Hart and Mohun\r\nthat the audience would not be distracted to see the best dancing in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n[306] The thirteen years' monopoly at Drury Lane came to an end in\r\n1695, when Betterton opened a new theatre at Lincoln's Inn Fields. In\r\n1705, Betterton's company moved to the new theatre in the Haymarket;\r\nbut the drama did not succeed at Vanbrugh's house, and in 1706 the\r\nHaymarket was let to M'Swiney. In 1708, through the instrumentality\r\nof Colonel Brett, the actors were again reunited at Drury Lane, and\r\nthe Haymarket Theatre was devoted to Italian operas. But Rich soon\r\nquarrelled with his company, some of whom entered into negotiations\r\nwith M'Swiney. In June 1709, Drury Lane Theatre was closed by an order\r\nfrom the Lord Chamberlain, and after certain structural alterations at\r\nthe Haymarket, plays were acted successfully at that house. For a time\r\nthere was thus again only one theatre open, until William Collier, M.\r\nP., a lawyer, got for himself the licence refused to Rich, and entered\r\ninto forcible possession.\r\n\r\n[307] In the \"Touchstone,\" 1728, attributed to James Ralph, we are told\r\nthat rope-dancing was then still in great esteem with the generality\r\nof people, though it had for some years been held in contempt in the\r\nrefined neighbourhood of St James's.

I was lost in this thought when the night came\r\nupon me, and drew my mind into a far more agreeable contemplation.\r\nThe heaven above me appeared in all its glories, and presented me\r\nwith such a hemisphere of stars, as made the most agreeable prospect\r\nimaginable to one who delights in the study of nature. It happened\r\nto be a freezing night, which had purified the whole body of air\r\ninto such a bright transparent æther, as made every constellation\r\nvisible; and at the same time gave such a particular glowing to the\r\nstars, that I thought it the richest sky I had ever seen. I could not\r\nbehold a scene so wonderfully adorned and lighted up (if I may be\r\nallowed that expression) without suitable meditations on the Author\r\nof such illustrious and amazing objects. For on these occasions,\r\nphilosophy suggests motives to religion, and religion adds pleasures to\r\nphilosophy. As soon as I had recovered my usual temper and serenity of\r\nsoul, I retired to my lodgings with the satisfaction of having passed\r\naway a few hours in the proper employments of a reasonable creature,\r\nand promising myself that my slumbers would be sweet. I no sooner fell\r\ninto them, but I dreamed a dream, or saw a vision (for I know not\r\nwhich to call it), that seemed to rise out of my evening meditation,\r\nand had something in it so solemn and serious that I cannot forbear\r\ncommunicating it; though I must confess, the wildness of imagination\r\n(which in a dream is always loose and irregular) discovers itself\r\ntoo much in several parts of it. Methoughts I saw the same azure sky\r\ndiversified with the same glorious luminaries which had entertained\r\nme a little before I fell asleep. I was looking very attentively on\r\nthat sign in the heavens which is called by the name of the Balance,\r\nwhen on a sudden there appeared in it an extraordinary light, as if\r\nthe sun should rise at midnight. By its increasing in breadth and\r\nlustre, I soon found that it approached towards the earth; and at\r\nlength could discern something like a shadow hovering in the midst of\r\na great glory, which in a little time after I distinctly perceived\r\nto be the figure of a woman. I fancied at first it might have been\r\nthe angel or intelligence that guided the constellation from which it\r\ndescended; but upon a nearer view, I saw about her all the emblems with\r\nwhich the goddess of Justice is usually described. Her countenance was\r\nunspeakably awful and majestic, but exquisitely beautiful to those\r\nwhose eyes were strong enough to behold it; her smiles transported\r\nwith rapture, her frowns terrified to despair. She held in her hand\r\na mirror, endowed with the same qualities as that which the painters\r\nput into the hand of Truth. There streamed from it a light, which\r\ndistinguished itself from all the splendours that surrounded her,\r\nmore than a flash of lightning shines in the midst of daylight. As\r\nshe moved it in her hand, it brightened the heavens, the air, or\r\nthe earth. When she had descended so low as to be seen and heard by\r\nmortals, to make the pomp of her appearance more supportable, she threw\r\ndarkness and clouds about her, that tempered the light into a thousand\r\nbeautiful shades and colours, and multiplied that lustre, which was\r\nbefore too strong and dazzling, into a variety of milder glories.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the world was in an alarm, and all the inhabitants\r\nof it gathered together upon a spacious plain; so that I seemed to\r\nhave the whole species before my eyes. A voice was heard from the\r\nclouds, declaring the intention of this visit, which was, to restore\r\nand appropriate to every one living what was his due. The fear and\r\nhope, joy and sorrow, which appeared in that great assembly after this\r\nsolemn declaration, are not to be expressed. The first edict was then\r\npronounced, that all titles and claims to riches and estates, or to\r\nany part of them, should be immediately vested in the rightful owner.\r\nUpon this, the inhabitants of the earth held up the instruments of\r\ntheir tenure, whether in parchment, paper, wax, or any other form of\r\nconveyance; and as the goddess moved the mirror of truth which she\r\nheld in her hand, so that the light which flowed from it fell upon the\r\nmultitude, they examined the several instruments by the beams of it.\r\nThe rays of this mirror had a particular quality of setting fire to all\r\nforgery and falsehood. The blaze of papers, the melting of seals, and\r\ncrackling of parchments made a very odd scene. The fire very often ran\r\nthrough two or three lines only, and then stopped. Though I could not\r\nbut observe, that the flame chiefly broke out among the interlineations\r\nand codicils, the light of the mirror, as it was turned up and down,\r\npierced into all the dark corners and recesses of the universe, and\r\nby that means detected many writings and records which had been hidden\r\nor buried by time, chance, or design. This occasioned a wonderful\r\nrevolution among the people. At the same time, the spoils of extortion,\r\nfraud, and robbery, with all the fruits of bribery and corruption, were\r\nthrown together into a prodigious pile, that almost reached to the\r\nclouds, and was called \"the Mount of Restitution\"; to which all injured\r\npersons were invited to receive what belonged to them.\r\n\r\nOne might see crowds of people in tattered garments come up, and change\r\nclothes with others that were dressed with lace and embroidery. Several\r\nwho were plumbs, or very near it, became men of moderate fortunes; and\r\nmany others, who were overgrown in wealth and possessions, had no more\r\nleft than what they usually spent. What moved my concern most, was, to\r\nsee a certain street[312] of the greatest credit in Europe from one end\r\nto the other become bankrupt.\r\n\r\nThe next command was, for the whole body of mankind to separate\r\nthemselves into their proper families; which was no sooner done, but\r\nan edict was issued out, requiring all children to repair to their\r\ntrue and natural fathers. This put a great part of the assembly in\r\nmotion; for as the mirror was moved over them, it inspired every one\r\nwith such a natural instinct, as directed them to their real parents.\r\nIt was a very melancholy spectacle to see the fathers of very large\r\nfamilies become childless, and bachelors undone by a charge of sons\r\nand daughters. You might see a presumptive heir of a great estate ask\r\nblessing of his coachman, and a celebrated toast paying her duty to a\r\n_valet de chambre_. Many under vows of celibacy appeared surrounded\r\nwith a numerous issue. This change of parentage would have caused\r\ngreat lamentation, but that the calamity was pretty common, and that\r\ngenerally those who lost their children, had the satisfaction of seeing\r\nthem put into the hands of their dearest friends. Men were no sooner\r\nsettled in their right to their possessions and their progeny, but\r\nthere was a third order proclaimed, that all the posts of dignity and\r\nhonour in the universe should be conferred on persons of the greatest\r\nmerit, abilities, and perfection. The handsome, the strong, and the\r\nwealthy immediately pressed forward; but not being able to bear the\r\nsplendour of the mirror which played upon their faces, they immediately\r\nfell back among the crowd: but as the goddess tried the multitude by\r\nher glass, as the eagle does its young ones by the lustre of the sun,\r\nit was remarkable, that every one turned away his face from it who had\r\nnot distinguished himself either by virtue, knowledge, or capacity in\r\nbusiness, either military or civil. This select assembly was drawn up\r\nin the centre of a prodigious multitude, which was diffused on all\r\nsides, and stood observing them, as idle people use to gather about a\r\nregiment that are exercising their arms. They were drawn up in three\r\nbodies: in the first were the men of virtue; in the second, men of\r\nknowledge; and in the third, the men of business. It was impossible to\r\nlook at the first column without a secret veneration, their aspects\r\nwere so sweetened with humanity, raised with contemplation, emboldened\r\nwith resolution, and adorned with the most agreeable airs, which are\r\nthose that proceed from secret habits of virtue. I could not but take\r\nnotice, that there were many faces among them which were unknown, not\r\nonly to the multitude, but even to several of their own body.\r\n\r\nIn the second column, consisting of the men of knowledge, there had\r\nbeen great disputes before they fell into the ranks, which they did not\r\ndo at last without the positive command of the goddess who presided\r\nover the assembly. She had so ordered it, that men of the greatest\r\ngenius and strongest sense were placed at the head of the column:\r\nbehind these, were such as had formed their minds very much on the\r\nthoughts and writings of others. In the rear of the column were men\r\nwho had more wit than sense, or more learning than understanding.\r\nAll living authors of any value were ranged in one of these classes;\r\nbut I must confess, I was very much surprised to see a great body of\r\neditors, critics, commentators, and grammarians meet with so very\r\nill a reception. They had formed themselves into a body, and with a\r\ngreat deal of arrogance demanded the first station in the column of\r\nknowledge; but the goddess, instead of complying with their request,\r\nclapped them all into liveries, and bade them know themselves for no\r\nother but lackeys of the learned.\r\n\r\nThe third column were men of business, and consisting of persons in\r\nmilitary and civil capacities. The former marched out from the rest,\r\nand placed themselves in the front; at which the other shook their\r\nheads at them, but did not think fit to dispute the post with them.\r\nI could not but make several observations upon this last column of\r\npeople; but I have certain private reasons why I do not think fit to\r\ncommunicate them to the public. In order to fill up all the posts of\r\nhonour, dignity, and profit, there was a draught made out of each\r\ncolumn of men who were masters of all three qualifications in some\r\ndegree, and were preferred to stations of the first rank. The second\r\ndraught was made out of such as were possessed of any two of the\r\nqualifications, who were disposed of in stations of a second dignity.\r\nThose who were left, and were endowed only with one of them, had their\r\nsuitable posts. When this was over, there remained many places of trust\r\nand profit unfilled, for which there were fresh draughts made out of\r\nthe surrounding multitude who had any appearance of these excellences,\r\nor were recommended by those who possessed them in reality.\r\n\r\nAll were surprised to see so many new faces in the most eminent\r\ndignities; and for my own part, I was very well pleased to see that all\r\nmy friends either kept their present posts, or were advanced to higher.\r\n\r\nHaving filled my paper with those particulars of my vision which\r\nconcern the male part of mankind, I must reserve for another occasion\r\nthe sequel of it, which relates to the fair sex.[313]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[312] Lombard Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 101. [STEELE and ADDISON.[314]\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, Nov. 29_, to _Thursday, Dec. 1, 1709_.\r\n\r\n    ----Postquam fregit subsellia versu,\r\n    Esurit, intactam Paridi nisi vendit Agaven.\r\n\r\n  JUV., Sat. vii. 86.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Nov. 30._\r\n\r\nThe progress of my intended account of what happened when Justice\r\nvisited mortals, is at present interrupted by the observation and sense\r\nof an injustice against which there is no remedy, even in a kingdom\r\nmore happy in the care taken of the liberty and property of the subject\r\nthan any other nation upon earth. This iniquity is committed by a most\r\nimpregnable set of mortals, men who are rogues within the law; and in\r\nthe very commission of what they are guilty of, professedly own, that\r\nthey forbear no injury but from the terror of being punished for it.\r\nThese miscreants are a set of wretches we authors call pirates, who\r\nprint any book, poem, or sermon, as soon as it appears in the world,\r\nin a smaller volume, and sell it (as all other thieves do stolen\r\ngoods) at a cheaper rate.[315] I was in my rage calling them rascals,\r\nplunderers, robbers, highwaymen. But they acknowledge all that, and\r\nare pleased with those, as well as any other titles; nay, will print\r\nthem themselves to turn the penny. I am extremely at a loss how to act\r\nagainst such open enemies, who have not shame enough to be touched with\r\nour reproaches, and are as well defended against what we can say as\r\nwhat we can do. Railing therefore we must turn into complaint, which\r\nI cannot forbear making, when I consider that all the labours of my\r\nlong life may be disappointed by the first man that pleases to rob me.\r\nI had flattered myself, that my stock of learning was worth £150 per\r\nannum, which would very handsomely maintain me and my little family,\r\nwho are so happy or so wise as to want only necessaries. Before men\r\nhad come up to this bare-faced impudence, it was an estate to have a\r\ncompetency of understanding. An ingenious droll, who is since dead (and\r\nindeed it is well for him he is so, for he must have starved had he\r\nlived to this day), used to give me an account of his good husbandry\r\nin the management of his learning. He was a general dealer, and had\r\nhis \"Amusements\" as well comical as serious. The merry rogue said,\r\nwhen he wanted a dinner he wrote a paragraph of table-talk, and his\r\nbookseller upon sight paid the reckoning. He was a very good judge of\r\nwhat would please the people, and could aptly hit both the genius of\r\nhis readers and the season of the year in his writings. His brain,\r\nwhich was his estate, had as regular and different produce as other\r\nmen's land. From the beginning of November till the opening of the\r\ncampaign, he wrote pamphlets and letters to members of Parliament, or\r\nfriends in the country; but sometimes he would relieve his ordinary\r\nreaders with a murder, and lived comfortably a week or two upon strange\r\nand lamentable accidents. A little before the armies took the field,\r\nhis way was to open your attention with a prodigy; and a monster well\r\nwritten, was two guineas the lowest price. This prepared his readers\r\nfor his great and bloody news from Flanders in June and July. Poor\r\nTom![316] he is gone. But I observed, he always looked well after a\r\nbattle, and was apparently fatter in a fighting year. Had this honest\r\ncareless fellow lived till now, famine had stared him in the face,\r\nand interrupted his merriment, as it must be a solid affliction to\r\nall those whose pen is their portion. As for my part, I do not speak\r\nwholly for my own sake on this point; for palmistry and astrology will\r\nbring me in greater gains than these my papers; so that I am only in\r\nthe condition of a lawyer who leaves the bar for chamber practice.\r\nHowever, I may be allowed to speak in the cause of learning itself,\r\nand lament, that a liberal education is the only one which a polite\r\nnation makes unprofitable.[317] All mechanic artisans are allowed to\r\nreap the fruit of their invention and ingenuity without invasion; but\r\nhe that has separated himself from the rest of mankind, and studied\r\nthe wonders of the creation, the government of his passions, and the\r\nrevolutions of the world, and has an ambition to communicate the effect\r\nof half his life spent in such noble inquiries, has no property in\r\nwhat he is willing to produce, but is exposed to robbery and want,\r\nwith this melancholy and just reflection, that he is the only man\r\nwho is not protected by his country, at the same time that he best\r\ndeserves it. According to the ordinary rules of computation, the\r\ngreater the adventure is, the greater ought to be the profit of those\r\nwho succeed in it; and by this measure, none have pretence of turning\r\ntheir labours to greater advantage than persons brought up to letters.\r\nA learned education, passing through great schools and universities,\r\nis very expensive, and consumes a moderate fortune, before it is gone\r\nthrough in its proper forms. The purchase of an handsome commission or\r\nemployment, which would give a man a good figure in another kind of\r\nlife, is to be made at a much cheaper rate. Now, if we consider this\r\nexpensive voyage which is undertaken in the search of knowledge, and\r\nhow few there are who take in any considerable merchandise, how less\r\nfrequent it is to be able to turn what men have gained into profit?\r\nHow hard is it, that the very small number who are distinguished with\r\nabilities to know how to vend their wares, and have the good fortune\r\nto bring them into port, should suffer being plundered by privateers\r\nunder the very cannon that should protect them? The most eminent and\r\nuseful author of the age we live in, after having laid out a princely\r\nrevenue in works of charity and beneficence, as became the greatness of\r\nhis mind, and the sanctity of his character, would have left the person\r\nin the world who was the dearest to him in a narrow condition, had not\r\nthe sale of his immortal writings brought her in a very considerable\r\ndowry; though it was impossible for it to be equal to their value.\r\nEvery one will know that I here mean the works of the late Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury,[318] the copy of which was sold for £2500.\r\n\r\nI do not speak with relation to any party; but it has happened, and may\r\noften so happen, that men of great learning and virtue cannot qualify\r\nthemselves for being employed in business, or receiving preferments.\r\nIn this case, you cut them off from all support if you take from them\r\nthe benefit that may arise from their writings. For my own part, I have\r\nbrought myself to consider things in so unprejudiced a manner, that I\r\nesteem more a man who can live by the products of his understanding,\r\nthan one who does it by the favour of great men.\r\n\r\nThe zeal of an author has transported me thus far, though I think\r\nmyself as much concerned in the capacity of a reader. If this practice\r\ngoes on, we must never expect to see again a beautiful edition of a\r\nbook in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen the Memoirs of Sir William Temple[319] published\r\nin the same character and volume with the history of Tom Thumb, and\r\nthe works of our greatest poets shrunk into penny books and garlands.\r\nFor my own part, I expect to see my lucubrations printed on browner\r\npaper[320] than they are at present; and, if the humour continues, must\r\nbe forced to retrench my expensive way of living, and not smoke above\r\ntwo pipes a day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Lillie, perfumer at the corner of Beauford Buildings, has\r\ninformed me, that I am obliged to several of my customers for coming\r\nto his shop upon my recommendation; and has also given me further\r\nassurances of his upright dealing with all who shall be so kind as\r\nto make use of my name to him. I acknowledge this favour, and have,\r\nfor the service of my friends who frequent his shop, used the force of\r\nmagical powers to add value to his wares. By my knowledge in the secret\r\noperations of nature, I have made his powders, perfumed and plain, have\r\nthe same effect as love-powder to all who are too much enamoured to do\r\nmore than dress at their mistresses. His amber orange-flower, musk,\r\nand civet-violet, put only into a handkerchief, shall have the same\r\neffect towards an honourable lover's wishes as if he had been wrapped\r\nin his mother's smock. Wash-balls perfumed, camphored, and plain, shall\r\nrestore complexions to that degree, that a country fox-hunter who uses\r\nthem shall in a week's time look with a courtly and affable paleness,\r\nwithout using the bagnio or cupping. _N.

[ADDISON.\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, Dec. 1_, to _Saturday, Dec. 3, 1709_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Dec. 3._\r\n\r\nA CONTINUATION OF THE VISION.[322]\r\n\r\nThe male world were dismissed by the goddess of Justice, and\r\ndisappeared, when on a sudden the whole plain was covered with women.\r\nSo charming a multitude filled my heart with unspeakable pleasure; and\r\nas the celestial light of the mirror shone upon their faces, several\r\nof them seemed rather persons that descended in the train of the\r\ngoddess, than such who were brought before her to their trial. The\r\nclack of tongues, and confusion of voices, in this new assembly, was\r\nso very great, that the goddess was forced to command silence several\r\ntimes, and with some severity before she could make them attentive\r\nto her edicts. They were all sensible that the most important affair\r\namong womankind was then to be settled, which every one knows to be\r\nthe point of place. This had raised innumerable disputes among them,\r\nand put the whole sex into a tumult. Every one produced her claim, and\r\npleaded her pretensions. Birth, beauty, wit, or wealth, were words\r\nthat rung in my ears from all parts of the plain. Some boasted of the\r\nmerit of their husbands; others of their own power in governing them.\r\nSome pleaded their unspotted virginity; others their numerous issue.\r\nSome valued themselves as they were the mothers, and others as they\r\nwere the daughters, of considerable persons. There was not a single\r\naccomplishment unmentioned or unpractised. The whole congregation\r\nwas full of singing, dancing, tossing, ogling, squeaking, smiling,\r\nsighing, fanning, frowning, and all those irresistible arts which women\r\nput in practice to captivate the hearts of reasonable creatures. The\r\ngoddess, to end this dispute, caused it to be proclaimed, that every\r\none should take place according as she was more or less beautiful.\r\nThis declaration gave great satisfaction to the whole assembly, which\r\nimmediately bridled up, and appeared in all its beauties. Such as\r\nbelieved themselves graceful in their motion, found an occasion of\r\nfalling back, advancing forward, or making a false step, that they\r\nmight show their persons in the most becoming air. Such as had fine\r\nnecks and bosoms, were wonderfully curious to look over the heads of\r\nthe multitude, and observe the most distant parts of the assembly.\r\nSeveral clapped their hands on their foreheads, as helping their sight\r\nto look upon the glories that surrounded the goddess, but in reality\r\nto show fine hands and arms. The ladies were yet better pleased, when\r\nthey heard, that in the decision of this great controversy, each of\r\nthem should be her own judge, and take her place according to her own\r\nopinion of herself, when she consulted her looking-glass.\r\n\r\nThe goddess then let down the mirror of truth in a golden chain, which\r\nappeared larger in proportion as it descended and approached nearer\r\nto the eyes of the beholders. It was the particular property of this\r\nlooking-glass to banish all false appearances, and show people what\r\nthey are. The whole woman was represented, without regard to the usual\r\nexternal features, which were made entirely conformable to their real\r\ncharacters. In short, the most accomplished (taking in the whole circle\r\nof female perfections) were the most beautiful; and the most defective,\r\nthe most deformed. The goddess so varied the motion of the glass, and\r\nplaced it in so many different lights, that each had an opportunity of\r\nseeing herself in it.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe the rage, the pleasure, or astonishment,\r\nthat appeared in each face upon its representation in the mirror:\r\nmultitudes started at their own form, and would have broken the glass\r\nif they could have reached it. Many saw their blooming features\r\nwither as they looked upon them, and their self-admiration turned\r\ninto a loathing and abhorrence. The lady who was thought so agreeable\r\nin her anger, and was so often celebrated for a woman of fire and\r\nspirit, was frightened at her own image, and fancied she saw a fury\r\nin the glass. The interested mistress beheld a harpy, and the subtle\r\njilt a sphinx. I was very much troubled in my own heart to see such\r\na destruction of fine faces; but at the same time had the pleasure\r\nof seeing several improved, which I had before looked upon as the\r\ngreatest masterpieces of nature. I observed, that some few were so\r\nhumble as to be surprised at their own charms; and that many a one who\r\nhad lived in the retirement and severity of a vestal, shone forth in\r\nall the graces and attractions of a siren. I was ravished at the sight\r\nof a particular image in the mirror, which I think the most beautiful\r\nobject that my eyes ever beheld. There was something more than human\r\nin her countenance: her eyes were so full of light, that they seemed\r\nto beautify everything they looked upon. Her face was enlivened with\r\nsuch a florid bloom, as did not so properly seem the mark of health\r\nas of immortality. Her shape, her stature, and her mien were such as\r\ndistinguished her even there where the whole fair sex was assembled.\r\n\r\nI was impatient to see the lady represented by so divine an image,\r\nwhom I found to be the person that stood at my right hand, and in\r\nthe same point of view with myself. This was a little old woman, who\r\nin her prime had been about five feet high, though at present shrunk\r\nto about three-quarters of that measure; her natural aspect was\r\npuckered up with wrinkles, and her head covered with grey hairs. I had\r\nobserved all along an innocent cheerfulness in her face, which was now\r\nheightened into rapture as she beheld herself in the glass. It was an\r\nodd circumstance in my dream (but I cannot forbear relating it): I\r\nconceived so great an inclination towards her, that I had thoughts of\r\ndiscoursing her upon the point of marriage, when on a sudden she was\r\ncarried from me; for the word was now given, that all who were pleased\r\nwith their own images, should separate, and place themselves at the\r\nhead of their sex.\r\n\r\nThis detachment was afterwards divided into three bodies, consisting\r\nof maids, wives, and widows; the wives being placed in the middle,\r\nwith the maids on the right, and widows on the left; though it was\r\nwith difficulty that these two last bodies were hindered from falling\r\ninto the centre. This separation of those who liked their real selves\r\nnot having lessened the number of the main body so considerably as it\r\nmight have been wished, the goddess, after having drawn up her mirror,\r\nthought fit to make new distinctions among those who did not like the\r\nfigure which they saw in it. She made several wholesome edicts, which\r\nhave slipped out of my mind; but there were two which dwelt upon me,\r\nas being very extraordinary in their kind, and executed with great\r\nseverity. Their design was to make an example of two extremes in the\r\nfemale world: of those who are very severe on the conduct of others,\r\nand of those who are very regardless of their own. The first sentence,\r\ntherefore, the goddess pronounced, was, that all females addicted\r\nto censoriousness and detraction should lose the use of speech; a\r\npunishment which would be the most grievous to the offender, and (what\r\nshould be the end of all punishments) effectual for rooting out the\r\ncrime. Upon this edict, which was as soon executed as published, the\r\nnoise of the assembly very considerably abated. It was a melancholy\r\nspectacle, to see so many who had the reputation of rigid virtue struck\r\ndumb. A lady who stood by me, and saw my concern, told me, she wondered\r\nI could be concerned for such a pack of--I found, by the shaking of\r\nher head, she was going to give me their characters; but by her saying\r\nno more, I perceived she had lost the command of her tongue. This\r\ncalamity fell very heavy upon that part of women who are distinguished\r\nby the name of prudes, a courtly word for female hypocrites, who have\r\na short way to being virtuous, by showing that others are vicious. The\r\nsecond sentence was then pronounced against the loose part of the sex,\r\nthat all should immediately be pregnant who in any part of their lives\r\nhad run the hazard of it. This produced a very goodly appearance, and\r\nrevealed so many misconducts, that made those who were lately struck\r\ndumb, repine more than ever at their want of utterance; though, at\r\nthe same time (as afflictions seldom come single), many of the mutes\r\nwere also seized with this new calamity. The ladies were now in such\r\na condition, that they would have wanted room, had not the plain\r\nbeen large enough to let them divide their ground, and extend their\r\nlines on all sides. It was a sensible affliction to me to see such a\r\nmultitude of fair ones either dumb or big-bellied. But I was something\r\nmore at ease when I found that they agreed upon several regulations to\r\ncover such misfortunes: among others, that it should be an established\r\nmaxim in all nations, that a woman's first child might come into the\r\nworld within six months after her acquaintance with her husband; and\r\nthat grief might retard the birth of her last till fourteen months\r\nafter his decease.\r\n\r\nThis vision lasted till my usual hour of waking, which I did with some\r\nsurprise, to find myself alone, after having been engaged almost a\r\nwhole night in so prodigious a multitude. I could not but reflect with\r\nwonder at the partiality and extravagance of my vision; which according\r\nto my thoughts, has not done justice to the sex. If virtue in men is\r\nmore venerable, it is in women more lovely; which Milton has very\r\nfinely expressed in his \"Paradise Lost,\" where Adam, speaking of Eve,\r\nafter having asserted his own pre-eminence, as being first in creation\r\nand internal faculties, breaks out into the following rapture:\r\n\r\n    ----\"_Yet when I approach\r\n    Her loveliness, so absolute she seems,\r\n    And in herself complete, so well to know\r\n    Her own, that what she wills, or do, or say,\r\n    Seems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best.\r\n    All higher knowledge in her presence falls\r\n    Degraded. Wisdom, in discourse with her,\r\n    Loses, discountenanced, and like Folly shows.\r\n    Authority and Reason on her wait,\r\n    As one intended first, not after made\r\n    Occasionally: and to consummate all\r\n    Greatness of mind and nobleness, their seat\r\n    Build in her loveliest, and create an awe\r\n    About her, as a guard angelic placed._\"[323]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[322] See No. 100.\r\n\r\n[323] \"Paradise Lost,\" viii. 546.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 103.

I have much pleasure of this kind upon my\r\nspirits at present, occasioned by the fatigue of affairs which I went\r\nthrough last Saturday. It is some time since I set apart that day\r\nfor examining the pretensions of several who had applied to me for\r\ncanes, perspective-glasses, snuff-boxes, orange-flower waters, and the\r\nlike ornaments of life. In order to adjust this matter, I had before\r\ndirected Charles Lillie of Beauford Buildings to prepare a great bundle\r\nof blank licences in the following words:\r\n\r\n     \"You are hereby required to permit the bearer of this cane to pass\r\n     and repass through the streets and suburbs of London, or any place\r\n     within ten miles of it, without let or molestation; provided that\r\n     he does not walk with it under his arm, brandish it in the air, or\r\n     hang it on a button: in which case it shall be forfeited; and I\r\n     hereby declare it forfeited to any one who shall think it safe to\r\n     take it from him.\r\n\r\n  \"ISAAC BICKERSTAFF.\"\r\n\r\n     #/\r\n\r\nThe same form, differing only in the provisos, will serve for a\r\nperspective, snuff-box, or perfumed handkerchief. I had placed myself\r\nin my elbow-chair at the upper end of my great parlour, having\r\nordered Charles Lillie to take his place upon a joint-stool with a\r\nwriting-desk before him. John Morphew[325] also took his station at the\r\ndoor; I having, for his good and faithful services, appointed him my\r\nchamber-keeper upon court-days. He let me know, that there were a great\r\nnumber attending without. Upon which, I ordered him to give notice,\r\nthat I did not intend to sit upon snuff-boxes that day; but that those\r\nwho appeared for canes might enter. The first presented me with the\r\nfollowing petition, which I ordered Mr. Lillie to read:\r\n\r\n     \"To ISAAC BICKERSTAFF, Esq., Censor of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n     \"_The humble Petition of Simon Trippit_:\r\n\r\n     \"Sheweth--That your petitioner having been bred up to a cane from\r\n     his youth, it is now become as necessary to him as any other of\r\n     his limbs.\r\n\r\n     \"That a great part of his behaviour depending upon it, he should\r\n     be reduced to the utmost necessities if he should lose the use of\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     \"That the knocking of it upon his shoe, leaning one leg upon it,\r\n     or whistling with it on his mouth, are such great reliefs to him\r\n     in conversation, that he does not know how to be good company\r\n     without it.\r\n\r\n     \"That he is at present engaged in an amour, and must despair of\r\n     success, if it be taken from him.\r\n\r\n     \"Your petitioner therefore hopes, that (the premises tenderly\r\n     considered) your Worship will not deprive him of so useful and so\r\n     necessary a support.\r\n\r\n     \"And your petitioner shall ever, &c.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the hearing of his case, I was touched with some compassion, and\r\nthe more so when upon observing him nearer I found he was a prig. I\r\nbade him produce his cane in court, which he had left at the door.\r\nHe did so, and I finding it to be very curiously clouded, with a\r\ntransparent amber head, and a blue ribbon to hang upon his wrist,[326]\r\nI immediately ordered my clerk Lillie to lay it up, and deliver out to\r\nhim a plain joint headed with walnut; and then, in order to wean him\r\nfrom it by degrees, permitted him to wear it three days in a week, and\r\nto abate proportionably till he found himself able to go alone.\r\n\r\nThe second who appeared, came limping into the court: and setting forth\r\nin his petition many pretences for the use of a cane, I caused them\r\nto be examined one by one; but finding him in different stories, and\r\nconfronting him with several witnesses who had seen him walk upright,\r\nI ordered Mr. Lillie to take in his cane, and rejected his petition as\r\nfrivolous.\r\n\r\nA third made his entry with great difficulty, leaning upon a slight\r\nstick, and in danger of falling every step he took. I saw the weakness\r\nof his hams; and hearing that he had married a young wife about a\r\nfortnight before, I bade him leave his cane, and gave him a new pair\r\nof crutches, with which he went off in great vigour and alacrity.\r\nThis gentleman was succeeded by another, who seemed very much pleased\r\nwhile his petition was reading, in which he had represented, that\r\nhe was extremely afflicted with the gout, and set his foot upon the\r\nground with the caution and dignity which accompany that distemper. I\r\nsuspected him for an impostor, and having ordered him to be searched, I\r\ncommitted him into the hands of Dr. Thomas Smith,[327] in King Street\r\n(my own corn-cutter), who attended in an outward room, and wrought\r\nso speedy a cure upon him, that I thought fit to send him also away\r\nwithout his cane.\r\n\r\nWhile I was thus dispensing justice, I heard a noise in my outward\r\nroom; and inquiring what was the occasion of it, my door-keeper told\r\nme, that they had taken up one in the very fact as he was passing by\r\nmy door. They immediately brought in a lively fresh-coloured young\r\nman, who made great resistance with hand and foot, but did not offer\r\nto make use of his cane, which hung upon his fifth button. Upon\r\nexamination, I found him to be an Oxford scholar, who was just entered\r\nat the Temple. He at first disputed the jurisdiction of the court; but\r\nbeing driven out of his little law and logic, he told me very pertly,\r\nthat he looked upon such a perpendicular creature as man to make a\r\nvery imperfect figure without a cane in his hand. \"It is well known,\"\r\nsays he, \"we ought, according to the natural situation of our bodies,\r\nto walk upon our hands and feet; and that the wisdom of the ancients\r\nhad described man to be an animal of four legs in the morning, two at\r\nnoon, and three at night; by which they intimated, that a cane might\r\nvery properly become part of us in some period of life.\" Upon which I\r\nasked him, whether he wore it at his breast to have it in readiness\r\nwhen that period should arrive? My young lawyer immediately told me, he\r\nhad a property in it, and a right to hang it where he pleased, and to\r\nmake use of it as he thought fit, provided that he did not break the\r\npeace with it: and further said, that he never took it off his button,\r\nunless it were to lift it up at a coachman, hold it over the head of a\r\ndrawer, point out the circumstances of a story, or for other services\r\nof the like nature, that are all within the laws of the land. I did not\r\ncare for discouraging a young man who, I saw, would come to good; and\r\nbecause his heart was set upon his new purchase, I only ordered him to\r\nwear it about his neck, instead of hanging it upon his button, and so\r\ndismissed him. There were several appeared in court whose pretensions\r\nI found to be very good, and therefore gave them their licences upon\r\npaying their fees; as many others had their licences renewed who\r\nrequired more time for recovery of their lameness than I had before\r\nallowed them.\r\n\r\nHaving despatched this set of my petitioners, there came in a\r\nwell-dressed man, with a glass tube in one hand, and his petition in\r\nthe other. Upon his entering the room, he threw back the right side\r\nof his wig, put forward his right leg, and advancing the glass to\r\nhis right eye, aimed it directly at me. In the meanwhile, to make my\r\nobservations also, I put on my spectacles; in which posture we surveyed\r\neach other for some time. Upon the removal of our glasses, I desired\r\nhim to read his petition, which he did very promptly and easily; though\r\nat the same time it set forth, that he could see nothing distinctly,\r\nand was within very few degrees of being utterly blind; concluding\r\nwith a prayer, that he might be permitted to strengthen and extend his\r\nsight by a glass. In answer to this I told him, he might sometimes\r\nextend it to his own destruction. \"As you are now,\" said I, \"you are\r\nout of the reach of beauty; the shafts of the finest eyes lose their\r\nforce before they can come at you; you can't distinguish a toast from\r\nan orange-wench; you can see a whole circle of beauty without any\r\ninterruption from an impertinent face to discompose you. In short,\r\nwhat are snares for others--\" My petitioner would hear no more, but\r\ntold me very seriously, \"Mr. Bickerstaff, you quite mistake your man;\r\nit is the joy, the pleasure, the employment of my life, to frequent\r\npublic assemblies, and gaze upon the fair.\" In a word, I found his\r\nuse of a glass was occasioned by no other infirmity but his vanity,\r\nand was not so much designed to make him see, as to make him be seen\r\nand distinguished by others. I therefore refused him a licence for a\r\nperspective, but allowed him a pair of spectacles, with full permission\r\nto use them in any public assembly as he should think fit. He was\r\nfollowed by so very few of this order of men, that I have reason to\r\nhope this sort of cheats are almost at an end.\r\n\r\nThe orange-flower men appeared next with petitions, perfumed so\r\nstrongly with musk, that I was almost overcome with the scent; and\r\nfor my own sake was obliged forthwith to license their handkerchiefs,\r\nespecially when I found they had sweetened them at Charles Lillie's,\r\nand that some of their persons would not be altogether inoffensive\r\nwithout them. John Morphew, whom I have made the general of my dead\r\nmen, acquainted me, that the petitioners were all of that order, and\r\ncould produce certificates to prove it if I required it. I was so well\r\npleased with this way of their embalming themselves, that I commanded\r\nthe above-said Morphew to give it in orders to his whole army, that\r\nevery one who did not surrender himself up to be disposed of by the\r\nUpholders should use the same method to keep himself sweet during his\r\npresent state of putrefaction.\r\n\r\nI finished my session with great content of mind, reflecting upon\r\nthe good I had done; for however slightly men may regard these\r\nparticularities and little follies in dress and behaviour, they lead\r\nto greater evils. The bearing to be laughed at for such singularities,\r\nteach us insensibly an impertinent fortitude, and enable us to bear\r\npublic censure for things which more substantially deserve it. By\r\nthis means they open a gate to folly, and oftentimes render a man so\r\nridiculous as to discredit his virtues and capacities, and unqualify\r\nthem from doing any good in the world. Besides, the giving into\r\nuncommon habits of this nature is a want of that humble deference which\r\nis due to mankind, and (what is worst of all) the certain indication of\r\nsome secret flaw in the mind of the person that commits them. When I\r\nwas a young man, I remember a gentleman of great integrity and worth\r\nwas very remarkable for wearing a broad belt, and a hanger instead of\r\na fashionable sword, though in all other points a very well-bred man.\r\nI suspected him at first sight to have something wrong in him, but was\r\nnot able for a long while to discover any collateral proofs of it. I\r\nwatched him narrowly for six-and-thirty years, when at last, to the\r\nsurprise of everybody but myself, who had long expected to see the\r\nfolly break out, he married his own cook-maid.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[324] \"Written by Addison and Steele jointly\" (Tickell).\r\n\r\n[325] The publisher of the original issue of the _Tatler_.\r\n\r\n[326] See No. 26.\r\n\r\n[327] \"In King Street, Westminster, liveth Thomas Smith, who, by\r\nexperience and ingenuity, has learnt the art of taking out and curing\r\nall manner of corns, without pain or drawing blood.

I took care accordingly, and\r\nwas not a little pleased to see her enter the room with a decent and\r\nmatron-like behaviour, which I thought very much became her. I saw she\r\nhad a great deal to say to me, and easily discovered in her eyes, and\r\nthe air of her countenance, that she had abundance of satisfaction in\r\nher heart, which she longed to communicate. However, I was resolved\r\nto let her break into her discourse her own way, and reduced her to\r\na thousand little devices and intimations to bring me to the mention\r\nof her husband. But finding I was resolved not to name him, she began\r\nof her own accord. \"My husband,\" said she, \"gives his humble service\r\nto you;\" to which I only answered, \"I hope he is well,\" and without\r\nwaiting for a reply, fell into other subjects. She at last was out of\r\nall patience, and said (with a smile and manner that I thought had\r\nmore beauty and spirit than I had ever observed before in her), \"I\r\ndid not think, brother, you had been so ill-natured. You have seen,\r\never since I came in, that I had a mind to talk of my husband, and\r\nyou won't be so kind as to give me an occasion.\" \"I did not know,\"\r\nsaid I, \"but it might be a disagreeable subject to you. You do not\r\ntake me for so old-fashioned a fellow as to think of entertaining a\r\nyoung lady with the discourse of her husband. I know, nothing is more\r\nacceptable than to speak of one who is to be so; but to speak of one\r\nwho is so! Indeed, Jenny, I am a better bred man than you think me.\"\r\nShe showed a little dislike at my raillery; and by her bridling up, I\r\nperceived she expected to be treated hereafter not as Jenny Distaff,\r\nbut Mrs. Tranquillus. I was very well pleased with this change in her\r\nhumour; and upon talking with her on several subjects, I could not\r\nbut fancy that I saw a great deal of her husband's way and manner in\r\nher remarks, her phrases, the tone of her voice, and the very air of\r\nher countenance. This gave me an unspeakable satisfaction, not only\r\nbecause I had found her a husband, from whom she could learn many\r\nthings that were laudable, but also because I looked upon her imitation\r\nof him as an infallible sign that she entirely loved him. This is an\r\nobservation that I never knew fail, though I do not remember that any\r\nother has made it. The natural shyness of her sex hindered her from\r\ntelling me the greatness of her own passion; but I easily collected\r\nit, from the representation she gave me of his. \"I have everything,\"\r\nsays she, \"in Tranquillus that I can wish for; and enjoy in him (what\r\nindeed you have told me were to be met with in a good husband) the\r\nfondness of a lover, the tenderness of a parent, and the intimacy\r\nof a friend.\" It transported me to see her eyes swimming in tears of\r\naffection when she spoke. \"And is there not, dear sister,\" said I,\r\n\"more pleasure in the possession of such a man than in all the little\r\nimpertinences of balls, assemblies, and equipage, which it cost me so\r\nmuch pains to make you contemn?\" She answered, smiling, \"Tranquillus\r\nhas made me a sincere convert in a few weeks, though I am afraid you\r\ncould not have done it in your whole life. To tell you truly, I have\r\nonly one fear hanging upon me, which is apt to give me trouble in the\r\nmidst of all my satisfactions: I am afraid, you must know, that I shall\r\nnot always make the same amiable appearance in his eye that I do at\r\npresent. You know, brother Bickerstaff, that you have the reputation\r\nof a conjurer; and if you have any one secret in your art to make your\r\nsister always beautiful, I should be happier than if I were mistress\r\nof all the worlds you have shown me in a starry night.\" \"Jenny,\" said\r\nI, \"without having recourse to magic, I shall give you one plain rule,\r\nthat will not fail of making you always amiable to a man who has so\r\ngreat a passion for you, and is of so equal and reasonable a temper\r\nas Tranquillus. Endeavour to please, and you must please; be always\r\nin the same disposition as you are when you ask for this secret, and,\r\nyou may take my word, you will never want it. An inviolable fidelity,\r\ngood humour, and complacency of temper outlive all the charms of a fine\r\nface, and make the decays of it invisible.\"\r\n\r\nWe discoursed very long upon this head, which was equally agreeable to\r\nus both; for I must confess (as I tenderly love her), I take as much\r\npleasure in giving her instructions for her welfare as she herself\r\ndoes in receiving them. I proceeded therefore to inculcate these\r\nsentiments, by relating a very particular passage that happened within\r\nmy own knowledge.\r\n\r\nThere were several of us making merry at a friend's house in a country\r\nvillage, when the sexton of the parish church entered the room in a\r\nsort of surprise, and told us, that as he was digging a grave in the\r\nchancel, a little blow of his pick-axe opened a decayed coffin, in\r\nwhich there were several written papers. Our curiosity was immediately\r\nraised, so that we went to the place where the sexton had been at work,\r\nand found a great concourse of people about the grave. Among the rest,\r\nthere was an old woman, who told us, the person buried there was a\r\nlady, whose name I do not think fit to mention, though there is nothing\r\nin the story but what tends very much to her honour[328]. This lady\r\nlived several years an exemplary pattern of conjugal love, and dying\r\nsoon after her husband, who every way answered her character in virtue\r\nand affection, made it her death-bed request, that all the letters\r\nwhich she had received from him, both before and after her marriage,\r\nshould be buried in the coffin with her. These I found upon examination\r\nwere the papers before us. Several of them had suffered so much by\r\ntime, that I could only pick out a few words; as, \"My soul!\" \"Lilies!\"\r\n\"Roses!\" \"Dearest angel!\" and the like. One of them (which was legible\r\nthroughout) ran thus:\r\n\r\n     \"MADAM,\r\n\r\n     \"If you would know the greatness of my love, consider that of\r\n     your own beauty. That blooming countenance, that snowy bosom,\r\n     that graceful person, return every moment to my imagination: the\r\n     brightness of your eyes hath hindered me from closing mine since\r\n     I last saw you. You may still add to your beauties by a smile.\r\n     A frown will make me the most wretched of men, as I am the most\r\n     passionate of lovers.\"\r\n\r\nIt filled the whole company with a deep melancholy, to compare the\r\ndescription of the letter with the person that occasioned it, who was\r\nnow reduced to a few crumbling bones, and a little mouldering heap of\r\nearth. With much ado I deciphered another letter, which begun with \"My\r\ndear, dear wife.\" This gave me a curiosity to see how the style of\r\none written in marriage differed from one written in courtship. To my\r\nsurprise, I found the fondness rather augmented than lessened, though\r\nthe panegyric turned upon a different accomplishment. The words were as\r\nfollow:\r\n\r\n     \"Before this short absence from you, I did not know that I loved\r\n     you so much as I really do; though at the same time, I thought I\r\n     loved you as much as possible. I am under great apprehensions,\r\n     lest you should have any uneasiness whilst I am defrauded of my\r\n     share in it, and can't think of tasting any pleasures that you\r\n     don't partake with me. Pray, my dear, be careful of your health,\r\n     if for no other reason because you know I could not outlive you.\r\n     It is natural in absence to make professions of an inviolable\r\n     constancy; but towards so much merit, it is scarce a virtue,\r\n     especially when it is but a bare return to that of which you have\r\n     given me such continued proofs ever since our first acquaintance.\r\n\r\n  \"I am, &c.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt happened that the daughter of these two excellent persons was by\r\nwhen I was reading this letter. At the sight of the coffin, in which\r\nwas the body of her mother, near that of her father, she melted into\r\na flood of tears. As I had heard a great character of her virtue, and\r\nobserved in her this instance of filial piety, I could not resist my\r\nnatural inclination of giving advice to young people, and therefore\r\naddressed myself to her: \"Young lady,\" said I, \"you see how short is\r\nthe possession of that beauty in which Nature has been so liberal to\r\nyou. You find the melancholy sight before you, is a contradiction\r\nto the first letter that you heard on that subject; whereas you may\r\nobserve, the second letter, which celebrates your mother's constancy,\r\nis itself, being found in this place, an argument of it. But, Madam, I\r\nought to caution you, not to think the bodies that lie before you, your\r\nfather and your mother. Know their constancy is rewarded by a nobler\r\nunion than by this mingling of their ashes, in a state where there is\r\nno danger or possibility of a second separation.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[328] We are told that a son of Sir Thomas Chicheley, one of King\r\nWilliam's admirals, said that this lady was his mother, and that the\r\nletters were genuine. There is a mezzotint of Mrs. Sarah Chicheley, by\r\nSmith, from a painting by Kneller.

Thus my life passes away in a restless pursuit of\r\nfame, and a preparation to defend myself against such as attack it.\r\nThis anxiety on the point of reputation is the peculiar distress of\r\nfine spirits, and makes them liable to a thousand inquietudes, from\r\nwhich men of grosser understandings are exempt; so that nothing is more\r\ncommon than to see one part of mankind live at perfect ease under such\r\ncircumstances as would make another part of them entirely miserable.\r\n\r\nThis may serve for a preface to the history of poor Will Rosin, the\r\nfiddler of Wapping[329], who is a man as much made for happiness, and a\r\nquiet life, as any one breathing; but has been lately entangled in so\r\nmany intricate and unreasonable distresses, as would have made him (had\r\nhe been a man of too nice honour) the most wretched of all mortals.\r\nI came to the knowledge of his affairs by mere accident. Several of\r\nthe narrow end of our lane having made an appointment to visit some\r\nfriends beyond St. Katherine's[330], where there was to be a merry\r\nmeeting, they would needs take with them the old gentleman, as they are\r\npleased to call me. I, who value my company by their good-will, which\r\nnaturally has the same effect as good-breeding, was not too stately, or\r\ntoo wise, to accept of the invitation. Our design was to be spectators\r\nof a sea-ball; to which I readily consented, provided I might be\r\n_incognito_, being naturally pleased with the survey of human life in\r\nall its degrees and circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn order to this merriment, Will Rosin (who is the Corelli[331] of\r\nthe Wapping side, as Tom Scrape is the Bononcini[332] of Redriffe) was\r\nimmediately sent for; but to our utter disappointment, poor Will was\r\nunder an arrest, and desired the assistance of all his kind masters\r\nand mistresses, or he must go to gaol. The whole company received\r\nhis message with great humanity, and very generously threw in their\r\nhalfpence apiece in a great dish, which purchased his redemption out of\r\nthe hands of the bailiffs. During the negotiation for his enlargement,\r\nI had an opportunity of acquainting myself with his history.\r\n\r\nMr. William Rosin, of the parish of St. Katherine, is somewhat stricken\r\nin years, and married to a young widow, who has very much the ascendant\r\nover him: this degenerate age being so perverted in all things, that\r\neven in the state of matrimony the young pretend to govern their\r\nelders. The musician is extremely fond of her; but is often obliged to\r\nlay by his fiddle to hear louder notes of hers, when she is pleased\r\nto be angry with him: for you are to know, Will is not of consequence\r\nenough to enjoy her conversation but when she chides him, or makes use\r\nof him to carry on her amours. For she is a woman of stratagem; and\r\neven in that part of the world where one would expect but very little\r\ngallantry, by the force of natural genius, she can be sullen, sick,\r\nout of humour, splenetic, want new clothes, and more money, as well as\r\nif she had been bred in Cheapside or Cornhill. She was lately under\r\na secret discontent upon account of a lover she was like to lose by\r\nhis marriage: for her gallant, Mr. Ezekiel Boniface, had been twice\r\nasked in church, in order to be joined in matrimony with Mrs. Winifred\r\nDimple, spinster, of the same parish. Hereupon Mrs. Rosin was far gone\r\nin that distemper which well-governed husbands know by the description\r\nof, \"I am I know not how;\" and Will soon understood, that it was his\r\npart to inquire into the occasion of her melancholy, or suffer as the\r\ncause of it himself. After much importunity, all he could get out of\r\nher, was, that she was the most unhappy and the most wicked of all\r\nwomen, and had no friend in the world to tell her grief to. Upon this,\r\nWill doubled his importunities; but she said that she should break\r\nher poor heart, if he did not take a solemn oath upon a Book, that he\r\nwould not be angry; and that he would expose the person who had wronged\r\nher to all the world, for the ease of her mind, which was no way else\r\nto be quieted. The fiddler was so melted, that he immediately kissed\r\nher, and afterwards the Book. When his oath was taken, she began to\r\nlament herself, and revealed to him, that (miserable woman as she was)\r\nshe had been false to his bed. Will was glad to hear it was no worse;\r\nbut before he could reply, \"Nay,\" said she, \"I will make you all the\r\natonement I can, and take shame upon me by proclaiming it to all the\r\nworld, which is the only thing that can remove my present terrors of\r\nmind.\" This was indeed too true; for her design was to prevent Mr.\r\nBoniface's marriage, which was all she apprehended. Will was thoroughly\r\nangry, and began to curse and swear, the ordinary expressions of\r\npassion in persons of his condition. Upon which his wife--\"Ah William!\r\nhow well you mind the oath you have taken, and the distress of your\r\npoor wife, who can keep nothing from you; I hope you won't be such a\r\nperjured wretch as to forswear yourself.\" The fiddler answered, that\r\nhis oath obliged him only not to be angry at what was past; \"but I find\r\nyou intend to make me laughed at all over Wapping.\" \"No, no,\" replied\r\nMrs. Rosin, \"I see well enough what you would be at, you poor-spirited\r\ncuckold--you are afraid to expose Boniface, who has abused your\r\npoor wife, and would fain persuade me still to suffer the stings of\r\nconscience; but I assure you, sirrah, I won't go to the devil for\r\nyou.\" Poor Will was not made for contention, and beseeching her to be\r\npacified, desired she would consult the good of her soul her own way,\r\nfor he would not say her nay in anything.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rosin was so very loud and public in her invectives against\r\nBoniface, that the parents of his mistress forbade the banns, and\r\nhis match was prevented, which was the whole design of this deep\r\nstratagem. The father of Boniface brought his action of defamation,\r\narrested the fiddler, and recovered damages. This was the distress\r\nfrom which he was relieved by the company; and the good husband's air,\r\nhistory, and jollity, upon his enlargement, gave occasion to very\r\nmuch mirth; especially when Will, finding he had friends to stand by\r\nhim, proclaimed himself a cuckold by way of insult over the family of\r\nthe Bonifaces. Here is a man of tranquillity without reading Seneca!\r\nWhat work had such an incident made among persons of distinction?\r\nThe brothers and kindred of each side must have been drawn out, and\r\nhereditary hatreds entailed on the families as long as their very names\r\nremained in the world. Who would believe that Herod, Othello, and Will\r\nRosin were of the same species?\r\n\r\nThere are quite different sentiments which reign in the parlour and the\r\nkitchen; and it is by the point of honour, when justly regulated and\r\ninviolably observed, that some men are superior to others, as much as\r\nmankind in general are to brutes. This puts me in mind of a passage in\r\nthe admirable poem called the \"Dispensary,\"[333] where the nature of\r\ntrue honour is artfully described in an ironical dispraise of it:\r\n\r\n    _But e'er we once engage in honour's cause,\r\n    First know what honour is, and whence it was.\r\n    Scorned by the base, 'tis courted by the brave,\r\n    The hero's tyrant, and the coward's slave.\r\n    Born in the noisy camp, it lives on air;\r\n    And both exists by hope and by despair.\r\n    Angry whene'er a moment's ease we gain,\r\n    And reconciled at our returns of pain.\r\n    It lives when in death's arms the hero lies;\r\n    But when his safety he consults, it dies.\r\n    Bigoted to this idol, we disclaim\r\n    Rest, health, and ease, for nothing but a name._\r\n\r\nA very old fellow visited me to-day at my lodgings, and desired\r\nencouragement and recommendation from me for a new invention of\r\nknockers to doors, which he told me he had made, and professed to\r\nteach rustic servants the use of them. I desired him to show me an\r\nexperiment of this invention; upon which he fixed one of his knockers\r\nto my parlour door. He then gave me a complete set of knocks, from the\r\nsolitary rap of the dun and beggar to the thunderings of the saucy\r\nfootman of quality, with several flourishes and rattlings never yet\r\nperformed. He likewise played over some private notes, distinguishing\r\nthe familiar friend or relation from the most modish visitor; and\r\ndirecting when the reserve candles are to be lighted. He has several\r\nother curiosities in this art. He waits only to receive my approbation\r\nof the main design. He is now ready to practise to such as shall apply\r\nthemselves to him; but I have put off his public licence till next\r\ncourt day.\r\n\r\n_N.

I had not long enjoyed this secret pleasure of an author,\r\nwhen a gentleman, some of whose works I have been highly entertained\r\nwith,[335] accosted me after the following manner: \"Mr. Bickerstaff,\r\nyou know I have for some years devoted myself wholly to the Muses, and\r\nperhaps you will be surprised when I tell you I am resolved to take\r\nup and apply myself to business: I shall therefore beg you will stand\r\nmy friend, and recommend a customer to me for several goods that I\r\nhave now upon my hands.\" I desired him to let me have a particular,\r\nand I would do my utmost to serve him. \"I have first of all,\" says\r\nhe, \"the progress of an amour digested into sonnets, beginning with\r\na poem to the unknown fair, and ending with an epithalamium. I have\r\ncelebrated in it, her cruelty, her pity, her face, her shape, her\r\nwit, her good-humour, her dancing, her singing--\" I could not forbear\r\ninterrupting him: \"This is a most accomplished lady,\" said I; \"but has\r\nshe really, with all these perfections, a fine voice?\" \"Pugh,\" says\r\nhe, \"you do not believe there is such a person in nature. This was\r\nonly my employment in solitude last summer, when I had neither friends\r\nnor books to divert me.\" \"I was going,\" says I, \"to ask her name, but\r\nI find it is only an imaginary mistress.\" \"That's true,\" replied my\r\nfriend, \"but her name is Flavia. I have,\" continued he, \"in the second\r\nplace, a collection of lampoons, calculated either for the Bath,\r\nTunbridge, or any place where they drink waters, with blank spaces\r\nfor the names of such person or persons as may be inserted in them on\r\noccasion. Thus much I have told only of what I have by me proceeding\r\nfrom love and malice. I have also at this time the sketch of an heroic\r\npoem upon the next peace:[336] several indeed of the verses are either\r\ntoo long or too short, it being a rough draught of my thoughts upon\r\nthat subject.\" I thereupon told him, that as it was, it might probably\r\npass for a very good Pindaric, and I believed I knew one who would\r\nbe willing to deal with him for it upon that foot. \"I must tell you\r\nalso, I have made a dedication to it, which is about four sides close\r\nwritten, that may serve any one that is tall, and understands Latin. I\r\nhave further, about fifty similes that were never yet applied, besides\r\nthree-and-twenty descriptions of the sun rising, that might be of great\r\nuse to an epic poet. These are my more bulky commodities: besides\r\nwhich, I have several small-wares that I would part with at easy\r\nrates; as, observations upon life, and moral sentences, reduced into\r\nseveral couplets, very proper to close up acts of plays, and may be\r\neasily introduced by two or three lines of prose, either in tragedy or\r\ncomedy. If I could find a purchaser curious in Latin poetry, I could\r\naccommodate him with two dozen of epigrams, which, by reason of a few\r\nfalse quantities, should come for little or nothing.\"\r\n\r\nI heard the gentleman with much attention, and asked him, whether\r\nhe would break bulk, and sell his goods by retail, or designed they\r\nshould all go in a lump? He told me, that he should be very loth to\r\npart them, unless it was to oblige a man of quality, or any person for\r\nwhom I had a particular friendship. \"My reason for asking,\" said I,\r\n\"is, only because I know a young gentleman who intends to appear next\r\nspring in a new jingling chariot, with the figures of the nine Muses on\r\neach side of it; and I believe, would be glad to come into the world\r\nin verse.\" We could not go on in our treaty, by reason of two or three\r\ncritics that joined us. They had been talking, it seems, of the two\r\nletters which were found in the coffin, and mentioned in one of my\r\nlate lucubrations,[337] and came with a request to me, that I would\r\ncommunicate any others of them that were legible. One of the gentlemen\r\nwas pleased to say, that it was a very proper instance of a widow's\r\nconstancy; and said, he wished I had subjoined, as a foil to it, the\r\nfollowing passage in \"Hamlet.\" The young Prince was not yet acquainted\r\nwith all the guilt of his mother, but turns his thoughts on her sudden\r\nforgetfulness of his father, and the indecency of her hasty marriage.\r\n\r\n    ----_That it should come to this!\r\n    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two!\r\n    So excellent a king! that was to this\r\n    Hyperion to a satyr! So loving to my mother,\r\n    That he permitted not the winds of heaven\r\n    To visit her face too roughly! Heaven and earth!\r\n    Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,\r\n    As if increase of appetite had grown\r\n    By what it fed on. And yet, within a month!\r\n    Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!\r\n    A little month! or ere those shoes were old,\r\n    With which she followed my poor father's body,\r\n    Like Niobe all tears; why she, even she--\r\n    O Heaven! a brute, that wants discourse of reason,\r\n    Would have mourned longer!--married with mine uncle,\r\n    My father's brother! But no more like my father\r\n    Than I to Hercules! Within a month!\r\n    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears\r\n    Had left the flushing of her galled eyes,\r\n    She married--O most wicked speed! to post\r\n    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!\r\n    It is not, nor it cannot come to good!\r\n    But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue_![338]\r\n\r\nThe several emotions of mind, and breaks of passion, in this speech,\r\nare admirable. He has touched every circumstance that aggravated\r\nthe fact, and seemed capable of hurrying the thoughts of a son into\r\ndistraction. His father's tenderness for his mother, expressed in so\r\ndelicate a particular; his mother's fondness for his father, no less\r\nexquisitely described; the great and amiable figure of his dead parent\r\ndrawn by a true filial piety; his disdain of so unworthy a successor to\r\nhis bed; but above all, the shortness of the time between his father's\r\ndeath and his mother's second marriage, brought together with so much\r\ndisorder, make up as noble a part as any in that celebrated tragedy.\r\nThe circumstance of time I never could enough admire. The widowhood had\r\nlasted two months--this is his first reflection: but as his indignation\r\nrises, he sinks to scarce two months: afterwards into a month; and at\r\nlast, into a little month. But all this so naturally, that the reader\r\naccompanies him in the violence of his passion, and finds the time\r\nlessen insensibly, according to the different workings of his disdain.\r\nI have not mentioned the incest of her marriage, which is so obvious a\r\nprovocation; but cannot forbear taking notice, that when his fury is at\r\nits height, he cries, \"Frailty, thy name is woman!\" as railing at the\r\nsex in general, rather than giving himself leave to think his mother\r\nworse than others.--_Desiderantur multa._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhereas Mr. Jeffery Groggram has surrendered himself by his letter\r\nbearing date December 7, and has sent an acknowledgment that he is\r\ndead, praying an order to the Company of Upholders for interment at\r\nsuch a reasonable rate as may not impoverish his heirs: the said\r\nGroggram having been dead ever since he was born, and added nothing\r\nto his small patrimony, Mr. Bickerstaff has taken the premises into\r\nconsideration; and being sensible of the ingenuous and singular\r\nbehaviour of this petitioner, pronounces the said Jeffery Groggram\r\na live man, and will not suffer that he should bury himself out of\r\nmodesty; but requires him to remain among the living, as an example to\r\nthose obstinate dead men, who will neither labour for life, nor go to\r\ntheir grave.\r\n\r\n_N.

But at last, recovering himself, he\r\nsaid, with an air of great respect, \"Sir, it would be an injury to your\r\nknowledge in the occult sciences, to tell you what is my distress;\r\nI dare say, you read it in my countenance: I therefore beg your\r\nadvice to the most unhappy of all men.\" Much experience has made me\r\nparticularly sagacious in the discovery of distempers, and I soon saw\r\nthat his was love. I then turned to my commonplace book, and found his\r\ncase under the word \"coquette\"; and reading over the catalogue which\r\nI have collected out of this great city of all under that character,\r\nI saw at the name of Cynthia his fit came upon him. I repeated the\r\nname thrice after a musing manner, and immediately perceived his\r\npulse quicken two-thirds; when his eyes, instead of the wildness with\r\nwhich they appeared at his entrance, looked with all the gentleness\r\nimaginable upon me, not without tears. \"O sir!\" said he, \"you know\r\nnot the unworthy usage I have met with from the woman my soul dotes\r\non. I could gaze at her to the end of my being; yet when I have done\r\nso, for some time past I have found her eyes fixed on another. She is\r\nnow two-and-twenty, in the full tyranny of her charms, which she once\r\nacknowledged she rejoiced in, only as they made her choice of me, out\r\nof a crowd of admirers, the more obliging. But in the midst of this\r\nhappiness, so it is, Mr. Bickerstaff, that young Quicksett, who is\r\njust come to town, without any other recommendation than that of being\r\ntolerably handsome, and excessively rich, has won her heart in so\r\nshameless a manner, that she dies for him. In a word, I would consult\r\nyou, how to cure myself of this passion for an ungrateful woman, who\r\ntriumphs in her falsehood, and can make no man happy, because her own\r\nsatisfaction consists chiefly in being capable of giving distress. I\r\nknow Quicksett is at present considerable with her for no other reason\r\nbut that he can be without her, and feel no pain in the loss. Let me\r\ntherefore desire you, sir, to fortify my reason against the levity of\r\nan inconstant, who ought only to be treated with neglect.\" All this\r\ntime I was looking over my receipts, and asked him if he had any good\r\nwinter boots. \"Boots, sir!\" said my patient. I went on: \"You may easily\r\nreach Harwich in a day, so as to be there when the packet goes off.\"\r\n\"Sir,\" said the lover, \"I find you design me for travelling; but alas!\r\nI have no language; it will be the same thing to me as solitude, to be\r\nin a strange country. I have,\" continued he, sighing, \"been many years\r\nin love with this creature, and have almost lost even my English, at\r\nleast to speak such as anybody else does. I asked a tenant of ours, who\r\ncame up to town the other day with rent, whether the flowery mead near\r\nmy father's house in the country had any shepherd in it. I have called\r\na cave a grotto these three years, and must keep ordinary company, and\r\nfrequent busy people for some time, before I can recover my common\r\nwords.\" I smiled at his raillery upon himself, though I well saw it\r\ncame from a heavy heart. \"You are,\" said I, \"acquainted, to be sure,\r\nwith some of the general officers; suppose you made a campaign?\" \"If I\r\ndid,\" said he, \"I should venture more than any man there, for I should\r\nbe in danger of starving; my father is such an untoward old gentleman,\r\nthat he would tell me he found it hard enough to pay his taxes towards\r\nthe war, without making it more expensive by an allowance to me. With\r\nall this, he is as fond as he is rugged, and I am his only son.\"\r\n\r\nI looked upon the young gentleman with much tenderness, and not like a\r\nphysician, but a friend; for I talked to him so largely, that if I had\r\nparcelled my discourse into distinct prescriptions, I am confident I\r\ngave him two hundred pounds' worth of advice. He heard me with great\r\nattention, bowing, smiling, and showing all other instances of that\r\nnatural good-breeding which ingenuous tempers pay to those who are\r\nelder and wiser than themselves. I entertained him to the following\r\npurpose. \"I am sorry, sir, that your passion is of so long a date, for\r\nevils are much more curable in their beginnings; but at the same time\r\nmust allow, that you are not to be blamed, since your youth and merit\r\nhas been abused by one of the most charming, but the most unworthy,\r\nsort of women, the coquettes. A coquette is a chaste jilt, and differs\r\nonly from a common one, as a soldier, who is perfect in exercise, does\r\nfrom one that is actually in service. This grief, like all other, is\r\nto be cured only by time; and although you are convinced this moment,\r\nas much as you will be ten years hence, that she ought to be scorned\r\nand neglected, you see you must not expect your remedy from the force\r\nof reason. The cure then is only in time, and the hastening of the cure\r\nonly in the manner of employing that time. You have answered me as to\r\ntravel and a campaign, so that we have only Great Britain to avoid her\r\nin. Be then yourself, and listen to the following rules, which only can\r\nbe of use to you in this unaccountable distemper, wherein the patient\r\nis often averse even to his recovery. It has been of benefit to some\r\nto apply themselves to business; but as that may not lie in your way,\r\ngo down to your estate, mind your fox-hounds, and venture the life\r\nyou are weary of over every hedge and ditch in the country. These are\r\nwholesome remedies; but if you can have resolution enough, rather stay\r\nin town, and recover yourself even in the town where she inhabits.\r\nTake particular care to avoid all places where you may possibly meet\r\nher, and shun the sight of everything which may bring her to your\r\nremembrance; there is an infection in all that relates to her: you'll\r\nfind, her house, her chariot, her domestics, and her very lap-dog, are\r\nso many instruments of torment. Tell me seriously, do you think you\r\ncould bear the sight of her fan?\" He shook his head at the question,\r\nand said, \"Ah! Mr. Bickerstaff, you must have been a patient, or you\r\ncould not have been so good a physician.\" \"To tell you truly,\" said\r\nI, \"about the thirtieth year of my age, I received a wound that has\r\nstill left a scar in my mind, never to be quite worn out by time or\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\n\"The means which I found the most effectual for my cure, were\r\nreflections upon the ill-usage I had received from the woman I loved,\r\nand the pleasure I saw her take in my sufferings.\r\n\r\n\"I considered the distress she brought upon me the greatest that could\r\nbefall a human creature, at the same time that she did not inflict this\r\nupon one who was her enemy, one that had done her an injury, one that\r\nhad wished her ill; but on the man who loved her more than any else\r\nloved her, and more than it was possible for him to love any other\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n\"In the next place, I took pains to consider her in all her\r\nimperfections; and that I might be sure to hear of them constantly,\r\nkept company with those her female friends who were her dearest and\r\nmost intimate acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\"Among her highest imperfections, I still dwelt upon her baseness of\r\nmind and ingratitude, that made her triumph in the pain and anguish of\r\nthe man who loved her, and of one who in those days (without vanity be\r\nit spoken) was thought to deserve her love.\r\n\r\n\"To shorten my story, she was married to another, which would have\r\ndistracted me had he proved a good husband; but to my great pleasure,\r\nhe used her at first with coldness, and afterwards with contempt. I\r\nhear he still treats her very ill; and am informed, that she often says\r\nto her woman, 'This is a just revenge for my falsehood to my first\r\nlove: what a wretch am I, that might have been married to the famous\r\nMr. Bickerstaff.'\"\r\n\r\nMy patient looked upon me with a kind of melancholy pleasure, and told\r\nme, he did not think it was possible for a man to live to the age I now\r\nam of, who in his thirtieth year had been tortured with that passion in\r\nits violence. \"For my part,\" said he, \"I can neither eat, drink, nor\r\nsleep in it; nor keep company with anybody, but two or three friends\r\nwho are in the same condition.\"\r\n\r\n\"There,\" answered I, \"you are to blame; for as you ought to avoid\r\nnothing more than keeping company with yourself, so you ought to be\r\nparticularly cautious of keeping company with men like yourself. As\r\nlong as you do this, you do but indulge your distemper.\r\n\r\n\"I must not dismiss you without further instructions. If possible,\r\ntransfer your passion from the woman you are now in love with, to\r\nanother; or if you cannot do that, change the passion itself into\r\nsome other passion; that is, to speak more plainly, find out some\r\nother agreeable woman:[339] or if you can't do this, grow covetous,\r\nambitious, litigious; turn your love of woman into that of profit,\r\npreferment, reputation; and for a time, give up yourself entirely to\r\nthe pursuit.\r\n\r\n\"This is a method we sometimes take in physic, when we turn a desperate\r\ndisease into one we can more easily cure.\"\r\n\r\nHe made little answer to all this, but crying out, \"Ah, sir!\" for his\r\npassion reduced his discourse to interjections.\r\n\r\n\"There is one thing added, which is present death to a man in your\r\ncondition, and therefore to be avoided with the greatest care and\r\ncaution: that is, in a word, to think of your mistress and rival\r\ntogether, whether walking, discoursing, dallying--\" \"The devil!\" he\r\ncried out, \"who can bear it?\" To compose him, for I pitied him very\r\nmuch, \"The time will come,\" said I, \"when you shall not only bear it,\r\nbut laugh at it. As a preparation to it, ride every morning an hour at\r\nleast with the wind full in your face. Upon your return, recollect\r\nthe several precepts which I have now given you, and drink upon them a\r\nbottle of spa-water. Repeat this every day for a month successively,\r\nand let me see you at the end of it.\" He was taking his leave, with\r\nmany thanks, and some appearance of consolation in his countenance,\r\nwhen I called him back to acquaint him, that I had private information\r\nof a design of the coquettes to buy up all the true spa-water in town;\r\nupon which he took his leave in haste, with a resolution to get all\r\nthings ready for entering upon his regimen the next morning.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[339] This passage was censured by Thomas Baker in No. 72 of the\r\n_Female Tatler_ (December 21, 1707): \"Wisdom, virtue, and laboriousness\r\nhave always been inseparable from the famous Bickerstaff; but if the\r\ncharacters that have first recommended him to the public, and by which\r\nonly he was known to the world, are no more to be found in those\r\nworks that go under his name, the author is dead, and the papers are\r\nspurious,\" &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 108.

I\r\nam sure I feel it in so extraordinary a manner, that I cannot in a day\r\nor two get out of my imagination any very beautiful or disagreeable\r\nimpression which I receive on such occasions. For this reason I\r\nfrequently look in at the play-house, in order to enlarge my thoughts,\r\nand warm my mind with some new ideas, that may be serviceable to me in\r\nmy lucubrations. In this disposition I entered the theatre the other\r\nday, and placed myself in a corner of it, very convenient for seeing,\r\nwithout being myself observed. I found the audience hushed in a very\r\ndeep attention, and did not question but some noble tragedy was just\r\nthen in its crisis, or that an incident was to be unravelled which\r\nwould determine the fate of a hero. While I was in this suspense,\r\nexpecting every moment to see my old friend Mr. Betterton[340] appear\r\nin all the majesty of distress, to my unspeakable amazement, there came\r\nup a monster with a face between his feet; and as I was looking on, he\r\nraised himself on one leg in such a perpendicular posture, that the\r\nother grew in a direct line above his head.[341] It afterwards twisted\r\nitself into the motions and wreathings of several different animals,\r\nand after great variety of shapes and transformations, went off the\r\nstage in the figure of a human creature. The admiration, the applause,\r\nthe satisfaction, of the audience, during this strange entertainment,\r\nis not to be expressed. I was very much out of countenance for my\r\ndear countrymen, and looked about with some apprehension for fear any\r\nforeigner should be present. Is it possible, thought I, that human\r\nnature can rejoice in its disgrace, and take pleasure in seeing its\r\nown figure turned to ridicule, and distorted into forms that raise\r\nhorror and aversion? There is something disingenuous and immoral in\r\nthe being able to bear such a sight. Men of elegant and noble minds\r\nare shocked at seeing the characters of persons who deserve esteem\r\nfor their virtue, knowledge, or services to their country, placed in\r\nwrong lights, and by misrepresentation made the subject of buffoonery.\r\nSuch a nice abhorrence is not indeed to be found among the vulgar; but\r\nmethinks it is wonderful, that those who have nothing but the outward\r\nfigure to distinguish them as men, should delight in seeing it abused,\r\nvilified, and disgraced.\r\n\r\nI must confess, there is nothing that more pleases me in all that I\r\nread in books, or see among mankind, than such passages as represent\r\nhuman nature in its proper dignity. As man is a creature made up of\r\ndifferent extremes, he has something in him very great and very mean:\r\na skilful artist may draw an excellent picture of him in either of\r\nthese views. The finest authors of antiquity have taken him on the more\r\nadvantageous side. They cultivate the natural grandeur of the soul,\r\nraise in her a generous ambition, feed her with hopes of immortality\r\nand perfection, and do all they can to widen the partition between the\r\nvirtuous and the vicious, by making the difference betwixt them as\r\ngreat as between gods and brutes. In short, it is impossible to read a\r\npage in Plato, Tully, and a thousand other ancient moralists, without\r\nbeing a greater and a better man for it. On the contrary, I could never\r\nread any of our modish French authors, or those of our own country who\r\nare the imitators and admirers of that trifling nation, without being\r\nfor some time out of humour with myself, and at everything about me.\r\nTheir business is to depreciate human nature, and consider it under its\r\nworst appearances. They give mean interpretations and base motives to\r\nthe worthiest actions: they resolve virtue and vice into constitution.\r\nIn short, they endeavour to make no distinction between man and man, or\r\nbetween the species of men and that of brutes. As an instance of this\r\nkind of authors, among many others, let any one examine the celebrated\r\nRochefoucault, who is the great philosopher for administering of\r\nconsolation to the idle, the envious, and worthless part of mankind.\r\n\r\nI remember a young gentleman of moderate understanding, but great\r\nvivacity, who by dipping into many authors of this nature, had got\r\na little smattering of knowledge, just enough to make an atheist or\r\na free-thinker, but not a philosopher or a man of sense. With these\r\naccomplishments, he went to visit his father in the country, who was a\r\nplain, rough, honest man, and wise, though not learned. The son, who\r\ntook all opportunities to show his learning, began to establish a new\r\nreligion in the family, and to enlarge the narrowness of their country\r\nnotions; in which he succeeded so well, that he had reduced the butler\r\nby his table-talk, and staggered his eldest sister. The old gentleman\r\nbegan to be alarmed at the schisms that arose among his children, but\r\ndid not yet believe his son's doctrine to be so pernicious as it really\r\nwas, till one day talking of his setting-dog, the son said, he did not\r\nquestion but Tray was as immortal as any one of the family; and in the\r\nheat of the argument told his father, that for his own part he expected\r\nto die like a dog. Upon which the old man, starting up in a very great\r\npassion, cried out, \"Then, sirrah, you shall live like one;\" and taking\r\nhis cane in his hand, cudgelled him out of his system. This had so good\r\nan effect upon him, that he took up from that day, fell to reading good\r\nbooks, and is now a Bencher in the Middle Temple.\r\n\r\nI do not mention this cudgelling part of the story with a design to\r\nengage the secular arm in matters of this nature; but certainly, if\r\nit ever exerts itself in affairs of opinion and speculation, it ought\r\nto do it on such shallow and despicable pretenders to knowledge, who\r\nendeavour to give man dark and uncomfortable prospects of his being,\r\nand destroy those principles which are the support, happiness, and\r\nglory of all public societies, as well as private persons.\r\n\r\nI think it is one of Pythagoras's Golden Sayings, that a man should\r\ntake care above all things to have a due respect for himself;[342]\r\nand it is certain, that this licentious sort of authors, who are for\r\ndepreciating mankind, endeavour to disappoint and undo what the most\r\nrefined spirits have been labouring to advance since the beginning\r\nof the world. The very design of dress, good-breeding, outward\r\nornaments, and ceremony, were to lift up human nature, and set it off\r\nto advantage. Architecture, painting, and statuary were invented with\r\nthe same design; as indeed every art and science contributes to the\r\nembellishment of life, and to the wearing off or throwing into shades\r\nthe mean or low parts of our nature. Poetry carries on this great end\r\nmore than all the rest, as may be seen in the following passage, taken\r\nout of Sir Francis Bacon's \"Advancement of Learning,\"[343] which gives\r\na truer and better account of this art than all the volumes that were\r\never written upon it.\r\n\r\n\"Poetry, especially heroical, seems to be raised altogether from a\r\nnoble foundation, which makes much for the dignity of man's nature.\r\nFor seeing this sensible world is in dignity inferior to the soul\r\nof man, poesy seems to endow human nature with that which history\r\ndenies, and to give satisfaction to the mind, with at least the shadow\r\nof things, where the substance cannot be had. For if the matter be\r\nthoroughly considered, a strong argument may be drawn from poesy,\r\nthat a more stately greatness of things, a more perfect order, and a\r\nmore beautiful variety, delights the soul of man, than any way can be\r\nfound in nature since the Fall. Wherefore seeing the acts and events,\r\nwhich are the subject of true history, are not of that amplitude as\r\nto content the mind of man; poesy is ready at hand to feign acts more\r\nheroical. Because true history reports the successes of business not\r\nproportionable to the merit of virtues and vices, poesy corrects it,\r\nand presents events and fortunes according to desert, and according\r\nto the law of Providence. Because true history, through the frequent\r\nsatiety and similitude of things, works a distaste and misprision in\r\nthe mind of man, poesy cheereth and refresheth the soul, chanting\r\nthings rare and various, and full of vicissitudes. So as poesy\r\nserveth and conferreth to delectation, magnanimity, and morality;\r\nand therefore it may seem deservedly to have some participation of\r\ndivineness, because it doth raise the mind, and exalt the spirit with\r\nhigh raptures, by proportioning the shows of things to the desires of\r\nthe mind; and not submitting the mind to things, as reason and history\r\ndo. And by these allurements and congruities, whereby it cherisheth the\r\nsoul of man, joined also with consort of music, whereby it may more\r\nsweetly insinuate itself; it hath won such access, that it hath been\r\nin estimation even in rude times and barbarous nations, when other\r\nlearning stood excluded.\"\r\n\r\nBut there is nothing which favours and falls in with this natural\r\ngreatness and dignity of human nature so much as religion, which does\r\nnot only promise the entire refinement of the mind, but the glorifying\r\nof the body, and the immortality of both.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[340] See No. 71.\r\n\r\n[341] An advertisement in the Harl. MSS. (Bagford's Collection, 5961)\r\ndescribes the performances of a young posture-master from Exeter: \"He\r\nmakes his hip and shoulder bones meet together; stands on one leg, and\r\nextends the other in a direct line over his head, half a yard.\" It has\r\nbeen suggested that the posture-master alluded to by Addison was Joseph\r\nClark, of whom there are various prints; but he died in 1690, and\r\ntherefore cannot have been seen by Isaac Bickerstaff \"the other day\" in\r\n1709.\r\n\r\n[342] \"Golden Sayings,\" 12.\r\n\r\n[343] Second Book, iii. 4. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 109.

At the lower end of the lane the word was\r\ngiven, that there was a great funeral coming by. The next moment came\r\nforward in a very hasty, instead of a solemn manner, a long train of\r\nlights, when at last a footman, in very high youth and health, with\r\nall his force, ran through the whole art of beating the door of the\r\nhouse next to me, and ended his rattle with the true finishing rap.\r\nThis did not only bring one to the door at which he knocked, but to\r\nthat of every one in the lane in an instant. Among the rest, my country\r\nmaid took the alarm, and immediately running to me, told me, there\r\nwas a fine, fine lady, who had three men with burial torches making\r\nway before her, carried by two men upon poles, with looking-glasses\r\non each side of her, and one glass also before, she herself appearing\r\nthe prettiest that ever was. The girl was going on in her story,\r\nwhen the lady was come to my door in her chair, having mistaken the\r\nhouse. As soon as she entered, I saw she was Mr. Isaac's[344] scholar\r\nby her speaking air, and the becoming stop she made when she began\r\nher apology. \"You'll be surprised, sir,\" said she, \"that I take this\r\nliberty, who am utterly a stranger to you: besides that it may be\r\nthought an indecorum that I visit a man.\" She made here a pretty\r\nhesitation, and held her fan to her face. Then, as if recovering her\r\nresolution, she proceeded: \"But I think you have said, that men of\r\nyour age are of no sex; therefore I may be as free with you as one of\r\nmy own.\" The lady did me the honour to consult me on some particular\r\nmatters, which I am not at liberty to report. But before she took\r\nher leave, she produced a long list of names, which she looked upon\r\nto know whither she was to go next. I must confess, I could hardly\r\nforbear discovering to her immediately, that I secretly laughed at the\r\nfantastical regularity she observed in throwing away her time; but I\r\nseemed to indulge her in it, out of a curiosity to hear her own sense\r\nof her way of life. \"Mr. Bickerstaff,\" said she, \"you cannot imagine\r\nhow much you are obliged to me in staying thus long with you, having so\r\nmany visits to make; and indeed, if I had not hopes that a third part\r\nof those I am going to will be abroad, I should be unable to despatch\r\nthem this evening.\" \"Madam,\" said I, \"are you in all this haste and\r\nperplexity, and only going to such as you have not a mind to see?\"\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said she, \"I have several now with whom I keep a constant\r\ncorrespondence, and return visit for visit punctually every week, and\r\nyet we have not seen each other since last November was twelvemonth.\"\r\n\r\nShe went on with a very good air, and, fixing her eyes on her list,\r\ntold me, she was obliged to ride about three miles and a half before\r\nshe arrived at her own house. I asked after what manner this list was\r\ntaken, whether the persons wrote their names to her and desired that\r\nfavour, or how she knew she was not cheated in her muster roll? \"The\r\nmethod we take,\" says she, \"is, that the porter or servant who comes to\r\nthe door, writes down all the names who come to see us, and all such\r\nare entitled to a return of their visit.\" \"But,\" said I, \"madam, I\r\npresume those who are searching for each other, and know one another\r\nby messages, may be understood as candidates only for each other's\r\nfavour; and that after so many howdees,[345] you proceed to visit or\r\nnot, as you like the run of each other's reputation or fortune.\" \"You\r\nunderstand it aright,\" said she, \"and we become friends as soon as we\r\nare convinced that our dislike to each other may be of any consequence;\r\nfor to tell you truly,\" said she \"(for it is in vain to hide anything\r\nfrom a man of your penetration), general visits are not made out of\r\ngood-will, but for fear of ill-will. Punctuality in this case is\r\noften a suspicious circumstance; and there is nothing so common as\r\nto have a lady say, 'I hope she has heard nothing of what I said of\r\nher, that she grows so great with me.' But indeed, my porter is so\r\ndull and negligent, that I fear he has not put down half the people I\r\nowe visits to.\" \"Madam,\" said I, \"methinks it should be very proper\r\nif your gentleman-usher or groom of the chamber were always to keep\r\nan account by way of debtor and creditor. I know a city lady who uses\r\nthat method, which I think very laudable; for though you may possibly\r\nat the Court end of the town receive at the door, and light up better\r\nthan within Temple Bar, yet I must do that justice to my friends the\r\nladies within the walls to own, that they are much more exact in their\r\ncorrespondence. The lady I was going to mention as an example, has\r\nalways the second apprentice out of the counting-house for her own use\r\non her visiting day, and he sets down very methodically all the visits\r\nwhich are made her. I remember very well, that on the first of January\r\nlast, when she made up her account for the year 1708, it stood thus:\r\n\r\n    Mrs. COURTWOOD.             _Dr._ |_Per contra._            _Cr._\r\n                                      |\r\n  To seventeen hundred and            |By eleven hundred and nine\r\n  four visits received          1704  |paid                     1109\r\n                                      |Due to balance            595\r\n                                      |                         ----\r\n                                      |                         1704\r\n\r\n\"This gentlewoman is a woman of great economy, and was not afraid to go\r\nto the bottom of her affairs; and therefore ordered her apprentice to\r\ngive her credit for my Lady Easy's impertinent visits upon wrong days,\r\nand deduct only twelve per cent. He had orders also to subtract one and\r\na half from the whole of such as she had denied herself to before she\r\nkept a day; and after taking those proper articles of credit on her\r\nside, she was in arrear but five hundred. She ordered her husband to\r\nbuy in a couple of fresh coach-horses; and with no other loss than the\r\ndeath of two footmen, and a churchyard cough brought upon her coachman,\r\nshe was clear in the world on the 10th of February last, and keeps so\r\nbeforehand, that she pays everybody their own, and yet makes daily\r\nnew acquaintances.\" I know not whether this agreeable visitant was\r\nfired with the example of the lady I told her of, but she immediately\r\nvanished out of my sight, it being, it seems, as necessary a point of\r\ngood-breeding, to go off as if you stole something out of the house, as\r\nit is to enter as if you came to fire it. I do not know one thing that\r\ncontributes so much to the lessening the esteem men of sense have to\r\nthe fair sex as this article of visits. A young lady cannot be married,\r\nbut all the impertinents in town must be beating the tattoo from one\r\nquarter of the town to the other, to show they know what passes. If\r\na man of honour should once in an age marry a woman of merit for her\r\nintrinsic value, the envious things are all in motion in an instant\r\nto make it known to the sisterhood as an indiscretion, and publish to\r\nthe town how many pounds he might have had to have been troubled with\r\none of them. After they are tired with that, the next thing is, to\r\nmake their compliments to the married couple and their relations. They\r\nare equally busy at a funeral, and the death of a person of quality\r\nis always attended with the murder of several sets of coach-horses\r\nand chairmen. In both cases, the visitants are wholly unaffected,\r\neither with joy or sorrow. For which reason, their congratulations\r\nand condolences are equally words of course; and one would be thought\r\nwonderfully ill-bred, that should build upon such expressions as\r\nencouragements, to expect from them any instance of friendship.\r\n\r\nThus are the true causes of living, and the solid pleasures of life,\r\nlost in show, imposture, and impertinence. As for my part, I think most\r\nof the misfortunes in families arise from the trifling way the women\r\nhave in spending their time, and gratifying only their eyes and ears,\r\ninstead of their reason and understanding.\r\n\r\nA fine young woman, bred under a visiting mother, knows all that is\r\npossible for her to be acquainted with by report, and sees the virtuous\r\nand the vicious used so indifferently, that the fears she is born with\r\nare abated, and desires indulged, in proportion to her love of that\r\nlight and trifling conversation. I know I talk like an old man; but I\r\nmust go on to say, that I think the general reception of mixed company,\r\nand the pretty fellows that are admitted at those assemblies, give a\r\nyoung woman so false an idea of life, that she is generally bred up\r\nwith a scorn of that sort of merit in a man which only can make her\r\nhappy in marriage; and the wretch to whose lot she falls, very often\r\nreceives in his arms a coquette, with the refuse of a heart long before\r\ngiven away to a coxcomb.\r\n\r\nHaving received from the Society of Upholders sundry complaints of the\r\nobstinate and refractory behaviour of several dead persons, who have\r\nbeen guilty of very great outrages and disorders, and by that means\r\nelapsed the proper time of their interment; and having on the other\r\nhand received many appeals from the aforesaid dead persons, wherein\r\nthey desire to be heard before such their interment; I have set apart\r\nWednesday the 21st instant, as an extraordinary court-day for the\r\nhearing both parties. If therefore any one can allege why they or any\r\nof their acquaintance should or should not be buried, I desire they may\r\nbe ready with their witnesses at that time, or that they will for ever\r\nafter hold their tongues.\r\n\r\n_N.B._--This is the last hearing on this subject.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[344] A dancing-master (see No. 34).\r\n\r\n[345] _Cf._ Swift, \"Journal to Stella,\" May 10, 1712--\"I have been\r\nreturning the visits of those that sent howdees in my sickness;\" and\r\n\"Verses on his own Death,\" 1731 (quoted by Mr. Dobson):\r\n\r\n    \"When daily howd'y's come of course,\r\n    And servants answer, 'Worse and worse!'\"\r\n\r\nServants were frequently sent to make these polite inquiries; and\r\nSteele speaks of \"the how-d'ye servants of our women\" (_Spectator_, No.\r\n143).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 110.

Mr. Lillie read her indictment, which was\r\nin substance, that whereas Mrs. Rebecca Pindust, of the parish of St.\r\nMartin's-in-the-Fields, had, by the use of one instrument, called a\r\nlooking-glass, and by the further use of certain attire, made either of\r\ncambric, muslin, or other linen wares, upon her head, attained to such\r\nan evil art and magical force in the motion of her eyes and turn of her\r\ncountenance, that she the said Rebecca had put to death several young\r\nmen of the said parish; and that the said young men had acknowledged\r\nin certain papers, commonly called love letters (which were produced\r\nin court, gilded on the edges, and sealed with a particular wax, with\r\ncertain amorous and enchanting words wrought upon the said seals), that\r\nthey died for the said Rebecca: and whereas the said Rebecca persisted\r\nin the said evil practice; this way of life the said society construed\r\nto be, according to former edicts, a state of death, and demanded an\r\norder for the interment of the said Rebecca.\r\n\r\nI looked upon the maid with great humanity, and desired her to make\r\nanswer to what was said against her. She said, it was indeed true\r\nthat she had practised all the arts and means she could to dispose of\r\nherself happily in marriage, but thought she did not come under the\r\ncensure expressed in my writings for the same; and humbly hoped, I\r\nwould not condemn her for the ignorance of her accusers, who, according\r\nto their own words, had rather represented her killing than dead. She\r\nfurther alleged, that the expressions mentioned in the papers written\r\nto her, were become mere words, and that she had been always ready to\r\nmarry any of those who said they died for her; but that they made their\r\nescape as soon as they found themselves pitied or believed. She ended\r\nher discourse by desiring I would for the future settle the meaning of\r\nthe words, \"I die,\" in letters of love.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pindust behaved herself with such an air of innocence, that she\r\neasily gained credit, and was acquitted. Upon which occasion, I gave\r\nit as a standing rule, that any persons who in any letter, billet, or\r\ndiscourse, should tell a woman he died for her, should, if she pleased,\r\nbe obliged to live with her, or be immediately interred, upon such\r\ntheir own confession, without bail or mainprize.\r\n\r\nIt happened, that the very next who was brought before me was one of\r\nher admirers, who was indicted upon that very head. A letter which he\r\nacknowledged to be his own hand was read; in which were the following\r\nwords: \"Cruel creature, I die for you.\" It was observable, that he took\r\nsnuff all the time his accusation was reading. I asked him, how he came\r\nto use these words, if he were not a dead man? He told me, he was in\r\nlove with the lady, and did not know any other way of telling her so;\r\nand that all his acquaintance took the same method. Though I was moved\r\nwith compassion towards him by reason of the weakness of his parts,\r\nyet for example's sake, I was forced to answer, \"Your sentence shall\r\nbe a warning to all the rest of your companions, not to tell lies for\r\nwant of wit.\" Upon this, he began to beat his snuff-box with a very\r\nsaucy air; and opening it again, \"Faith, Isaac,\" said he, \"thou art\r\na very unaccountable old fellow--prithee, who gave thee power of life\r\nand death? What a pox hast thou to do with ladies and lovers? I suppose\r\nthou wouldst have a man be in company with his mistress, and say\r\nnothing to her. Dost thou call breaking a jest, telling a lie? Ha! is\r\nthat thy wisdom, old Stiffrump, ha?\" He was going on with this insipid\r\ncommonplace mirth, sometimes opening his box, sometimes shutting it,\r\nthen viewing the picture on the lid, and then the workmanship of the\r\nhinge, when, in the midst of his eloquence, I ordered his box to be\r\ntaken from him; upon which he was immediately struck speechless, and\r\ncarried off stone dead.[347]\r\n\r\nThe next who appeared, was a hale old fellow of sixty. He was brought\r\nin by his relations, who desired leave to bury him. Upon requiring a\r\ndistinct account of the prisoner, a credible witness deposed, that\r\nhe always rose at ten of the clock, played with his cat till twelve,\r\nsmoked tobacco till one, was at dinner till two, then took another\r\npipe, played at backgammon till six, talked of one Madam Frances, an\r\nold mistress of his, till eight, repeated the same account at the\r\ntavern till ten, then returned home, took another pipe, and then to\r\nbed. I asked him what he had to say for himself. \"As to what,\" said he,\r\n\"they mention concerning Madam Frances--\" I did not care for hearing a\r\nCanterbury tale, and therefore thought myself seasonably interrupted by\r\na young gentleman who appeared in the behalf of the old man, and prayed\r\nan arrest of judgment; for that he the said young man held certain\r\nlands by his the said old man's life. Upon this, the solicitor of the\r\nUpholders took an occasion to demand him also, and thereupon produced\r\nseveral evidences that witnessed to his life and conversation. It\r\nappeared, that each of them divided their hours in matters of equal\r\nmoment and importance to themselves and to the public. They rose at\r\nthe same hour: while the old man was playing with his cat, the young\r\none was looking out of his window; while the old man was smoking his\r\npipe, the young man was rubbing his teeth; while one was at dinner,\r\nthe other was dressing; while one was at backgammon, the other was at\r\ndinner; while the old fellow was talking of Madam Frances, the young\r\none was either at play, or toasting women whom he never conversed with.\r\nThe only difference was, that the young man had never been good for\r\nanything; the old man, a man of worth before he knew Madam Frances.\r\nUpon the whole, I ordered them to be both interred together, with\r\ninscriptions proper to their characters, signifying, that the old man\r\ndied in the year 1689, and was buried in the year 1709. And over the\r\nyoung one it was said, that he departed this world in the twenty-fifth\r\nyear of his death.\r\n\r\nThe next class of criminals were authors in prose and verse. Those of\r\nthem who had produced any still-born work, were immediately dismissed\r\nto their burial, and were followed by others, who, notwithstanding\r\nsome sprightly issue in their lifetime, had given proofs of their\r\ndeath by some posthumous children, that bore no resemblance to their\r\nelder brethren. As for those who were the fathers of a mixed progeny,\r\nprovided always they could prove the last to be a live child, they\r\nescaped with life, but not without loss of limbs; for in this case, I\r\nwas satisfied with amputation of the parts which were mortified.\r\n\r\nThese were followed by a great crowd of superannuated benchers of the\r\nInns of Court, senior Fellows of colleges, and defunct statesmen;\r\nall whom I ordered to be decimated indifferently, allowing the rest\r\na reprieve for one year, with a promise of a free pardon in case of\r\nresuscitation.\r\n\r\nThere were still great multitudes to be examined; but finding it very\r\nlate, I adjourned the court; not without the secret pleasure that I had\r\ndone my duty, and furnished out a handsome execution.\r\n\r\nGoing out of the court, I received a letter, informing me, that in\r\npursuance of the edict of justice in one of my late visions, all those\r\nof the fair sex began to appear pregnant who had run any hazard of it;\r\nas was manifest by a particular swelling in the petticoats of several\r\nladies in and about this great city. I must confess, I do not attribute\r\nthe rising of this part of the dress to this occasion, yet must own,\r\nthat I am very much disposed to be offended with such a new and\r\nunaccountable fashion. I shall, however, pronounce nothing upon it till\r\nI have examined all that can be said for and against it. And in the\r\nmeantime, think fit to give this notice to the fair ladies who are now\r\nmaking up their winter suits, that they may abstain from all dresses of\r\nthat kind till they shall find what judgment will be passed upon them;\r\nfor it would very much trouble me, that they should put themselves to\r\nan unnecessary expense; and could not but think myself to blame, if I\r\nshould hereafter forbid them the wearing of such garments, when they\r\nhave laid out money upon them, without having given them any previous\r\nadmonition.[348]\r\n\r\n_N.B._--A letter of the 16th instant about one of the 5th will be\r\nanswered according to the desire of the party, which he will see in few\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[346] \"Sir Richard Steele joined in this paper\" (Tickell)\r\n\r\n[347] An account of the effects of this gentleman is given by Hughes in\r\nNo. 113.\r\n\r\n[348] See Nos. 113 and 116.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 111.

I was considering, amidst the stillness of the night,\r\nwhat was the proper employment of a thinking being? what were the\r\nperfections it should propose to itself? and what the end it should aim\r\nat? My mind is of such a particular cast, that the falling of a shower\r\nof rain, or the whistling of wind, at such a time, is apt to fill my\r\nthoughts with something awful and solemn. I was in this disposition,\r\nwhen our bellman began his midnight homily (which he has been repeating\r\nto us every winter night for these twenty years) with the usual\r\nexordium:\r\n\r\n    _Oh! mortal man, thou that art born in sin!_\r\n\r\nSentiments of this nature, which are in themselves just and reasonable,\r\nhowever debased by the circumstances that accompany them, do not fail\r\nto produce their natural effect in a mind that is not perverted and\r\ndepraved by wrong notions of gallantry, politeness, and ridicule. The\r\ntemper which I now found myself in, as well as the time of the year,\r\nput me in mind of those lines in Shakespeare, wherein, according to his\r\nagreeable wildness of imagination, he has wrought a country tradition\r\ninto a beautiful piece of poetry. In the tragedy of \"Hamlet,\" where\r\nthe ghost vanishes upon the cock's crowing, he takes occasion to\r\nmention its crowing all hours of the night about Christmas time, and to\r\ninsinuate a kind of religious veneration for that season.\r\n\r\n    _It faded on the crowing of the cock.\r\n    Some say, that ever 'gainst that season comes\r\n    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,\r\n    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;\r\n    And then, they say, no spirit dares walk abroad;\r\n    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\r\n    No fairy takes, no witch has power to charm;\r\n    So hallowed, and so gracious is the time._[350]\r\n\r\nThis admirable author, as well as the best and greatest men of all\r\nages, and of all nations, seems to have had his mind thoroughly\r\nseasoned with religion, as is evident by many passages in his plays,\r\nthat would not be suffered by a modern audience; and are therefore\r\ncertain instances, that the age he lived in had a much greater sense of\r\nvirtue than the present.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed a melancholy reflection to consider, that the British\r\nnation, which is now at a greater height of glory for its counsels\r\nand conquests than it ever was before, should distinguish itself\r\nby a certain looseness of principles, and a falling off from those\r\nschemes of thinking, which conduce to the happiness and perfection\r\nof human nature. This evil comes upon us from the works of a few\r\nsolemn blockheads, that meet together with the zeal and seriousness of\r\napostles, to extirpate common-sense, and propagate infidelity. These\r\nare the wretches, who, without any show of wit, learning, or reason,\r\npublish their crude conceptions with an ambition of appearing more\r\nwise than the rest of mankind, upon no other pretence than that of\r\ndissenting from them. One gets by heart a catalogue of title-pages\r\nand editions; and immediately to become conspicuous, declares that\r\nhe is an unbeliever. Another knows how to write a receipt, or cut up\r\na dog, and forthwith argues against the immortality of the soul. I\r\nhave known many a little wit, in the ostentation of his parts, rally\r\nthe truth of the Scripture, who was not able to read a chapter in it.\r\nThese poor wretches talk blasphemy for want of discourse, and are\r\nrather the objects of scorn or pity, than of our indignation; but the\r\ngrave disputant, that reads and writes, and spends all his time in\r\nconvincing himself and the world that he is no better than a brute,\r\nought to be whipped out of a government, as a blot to a civil society,\r\nand a defamer of mankind. I love to consider an infidel, whether\r\ndistinguished by the title of deist, atheist, or free-thinker, in three\r\ndifferent lights, in his solitudes, his afflictions, and his last\r\nmoments.\r\n\r\nA wise man that lives up to the principles of reason and virtue, if one\r\nconsiders him in his solitude, as taking in the system of the universe,\r\nobserving the mutual dependence and harmony by which the whole frame of\r\nit hangs together, beating down his passions, or swelling his thoughts\r\nwith magnificent ideas of Providence, makes a nobler figure in the eye\r\nof an intelligent being, than the greatest conqueror amidst all the\r\npomps and solemnities of a triumph. On the contrary, there is not a\r\nmore ridiculous animal than an atheist in his retirement. His mind\r\nis incapable of rapture or elevation: he can only consider himself\r\nas an insignificant figure in a landscape, and wandering up and down\r\nin a field or a meadow, under the same terms as the meanest animals\r\nabout him, and as subject to as total a mortality as they, with this\r\naggravation, that he is the only one amongst them who lies under the\r\napprehension of it.\r\n\r\nIn distresses, he must be of all creatures the most helpless and\r\nforlorn; he feels the whole pressure of a present calamity, without\r\nbeing relieved by the memory of anything that is passed, or the\r\nprospect of anything that is to come. Annihilation is the greatest\r\nblessing that he proposes to himself, and a halter or a pistol the\r\nonly refuge he can fly to. But if you would behold one of these gloomy\r\nmiscreants in his poorest figure, you must consider him under the\r\nterrors, or at the approach, of death.\r\n\r\nAbout thirty years ago I was a-shipboard with one of these vermin, when\r\nthere arose a brisk gale, which could frighten nobody but himself. Upon\r\nthe rolling of the ship he fell upon his knees, and confessed to the\r\nchaplain, that he had been a vile atheist, and had denied a Supreme\r\nBeing ever since he came to his estate. The good man was astonished,\r\nand a report immediately ran through the ship, that there was an\r\natheist upon the upper deck. Several of the common seamen, who had\r\nnever heard the word before, thought it had been some strange fish;\r\nbut they were more surprised when they saw it was a man, and heard out\r\nof his own mouth, that he never believed till that day that there was\r\na God. As he lay in the agonies of confession, one of the honest tars\r\nwhispered to the boatswain, that it would be a good deed to heave him\r\noverboard. But we were now within sight of port, when of a sudden the\r\nwind fell, and the penitent relapsed, begging all of us that were\r\npresent, as we were gentlemen, not to say anything of what had passed.\r\n\r\nHe had not been ashore above two days, when one of the company began\r\nto rally him upon his devotion on shipboard, which the other denied in\r\nso high terms, that it produced the lie on both sides, and ended in\r\na duel. The atheist was run through the body, and after some loss of\r\nblood, became as good a Christian as he was at sea, till he found that\r\nhis wound was not mortal. He is at present one of the free-thinkers of\r\nthe age, and now writing a pamphlet against several received opinions\r\nconcerning the existence of fairies.\r\n\r\nAs I have taken upon me to censure the faults of the age and country\r\nwhich I live in, I should have thought myself inexcusable to have\r\npassed over this crying one, which is the subject of my present\r\ndiscourse. I shall therefore from time to time give my countrymen\r\nparticular cautions against this distemper of the mind, that is almost\r\nbecome fashionable, and by that means more likely to spread. I have\r\nsomewhere either read or heard a very memorable sentence, that a man\r\nwould be a most insupportable monster, should he have the faults that\r\nare incident to his years, constitution, profession, family, religion,\r\nage, and country; and yet every man is in danger of them all. For this\r\nreason, as I am an old man, I take particular care to avoid being\r\ncovetous, and telling long stories. As I am choleric, I forbear not\r\nonly swearing, but all interjections of fretting, as \"Pugh!\" \"Pish!\"\r\nand the like. As I am a layman, I resolve not to conceive an aversion\r\nfor a wise and a good man, because his coat is of a different colour\r\nfrom mine. As I am descended of the ancient family of the Bickerstaffs,\r\nI never call a man of merit an upstart. As a Protestant, I do not\r\nsuffer my zeal so far to transport me, as to name the Pope and the\r\ndevil together. As I am fallen into this degenerate age, I guard myself\r\nparticularly against the folly I have been now speaking of. And as I am\r\nan Englishman, I am very cautious not to hate a stranger, or despise a\r\npoor Palatine.[351]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[349] \"Steele assisted in this paper\" (Tickell).\r\n\r\n[350] \"Hamlet,\" act i. sc. i.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 112.

The year is almost at the lowest; so that in all\r\n     appearance, the rest of my letters between this and spring will\r\n     be dated from my parlour fire, where the little fond prattle of\r\n     a wife and children will so often break in upon the connection\r\n     of my thoughts, that you will easily discover it in my style. If\r\n     this winter should prove as severe as the last, I can tell you\r\n     beforehand, that I am likely to be a very miserable man, through\r\n     the perverse temper of my eldest boy. When the frost was in its\r\n     extremity, you must know, that most of the blackbirds, robins,\r\n     and finches of the parish (whose music had entertained me in\r\n     the summer) took refuge under my roof. Upon this, my care was,\r\n     to rise every morning before day to set open my windows for the\r\n     reception of the cold and the hungry, whom at the same time I\r\n     relieved with a very plentiful alms, by strewing corn and seeds\r\n     upon the floors and shelves. But Dicky, without any regard to the\r\n     laws of hospitality, considered the casements as so many traps,\r\n     and used every bird as a prisoner at discretion. Never did tyrant\r\n     exercise more various cruelties: some of the poor creatures he\r\n     chased to death about the room; others he drove into the jaws\r\n     of a bloodthirsty cat; and even in his greatest acts of mercy,\r\n     either clipped the wings, or singed the tails, of his innocent\r\n     captives. You will laugh, when I tell you I sympathised with\r\n     every bird in its misfortunes; but I believe you will think me in\r\n     the right for bewailing the child's unlucky humour. On the other\r\n     hand, I am extremely pleased to see his younger brother carry a\r\n     universal benevolence towards everything that has life. When he\r\n     was between four and five years old, I caught him weeping over a\r\n     beautiful butterfly, which he chanced to kill as he was playing\r\n     with it; and I am informed, that this morning he has given his\r\n     brother three halfpence (which was his whole estate) to spare the\r\n     life of a tomtit. These are at present the matters of greatest\r\n     moment within my observation, and I know are too trifling to be\r\n     communicated to any but so wise a man as yourself, and from one\r\n     who has the happiness to be,\r\n\r\n  \"Your most faithful,\r\n  And most obedient Servant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best critic that ever wrote, speaking of some passages in Homer\r\nwhich appear extravagant or frivolous, says indeed that they are\r\ndreams, but the dreams of Jupiter. My friend's letter appears to me\r\nin the same light. One sees him in an idle hour; but at the same time\r\nin the idle hour of a wise man. A great mind has something in it too\r\nsevere and forbidding, that is not capable of giving itself such little\r\nrelaxations, and of condescending to these agreeable ways of trifling.\r\nTully, when he celebrates the friendship of Scipio and Lælius,[353]\r\nwho were the greatest, as well as the politest, men of their age,\r\nrepresents it as a beautiful passage in their retirement, that they\r\nused to gather up shells on the seashore, and amuse themselves with\r\nthe variety of shape and colour which they met with in those little\r\nunregarded works of nature. The great Agesilaus could be a companion to\r\nhis own children, and was surprised by the ambassadors of Sparta[354]\r\nas he was riding among them upon a hobby-horse. Augustus indeed had no\r\nplayfellows of his own begetting; but is said to have passed many of\r\nhis hours with little Moorish boys at a game of marbles, not unlike\r\nour modern taw. There is (methinks) a pleasure in seeing great men\r\nthus fall into the rank of mankind, and entertain themselves with\r\ndiversions and amusements that are agreeable to the very weakest of\r\nthe species. I must frankly confess, that it is to me a beauty in\r\nCato's character, that he would drink a cheerful bottle with a friend;\r\nand I cannot but own, that I have seen with great delight one of the\r\nmost celebrated authors[355] of the last age feeding the ducks in St.\r\nJames's Park. By instances of this nature, the heroes, the statesmen,\r\nthe philosophers, become as it were familiar with us, and grow the more\r\namiable the less they endeavour to appear awful. A man who always acts\r\nin the severity of wisdom, or the haughtiness of quality, seems to move\r\nin a personated part: it looks too constrained and theatrical for a man\r\nto be always in that character which distinguishes him from others.\r\nBesides that, the slackening and unbending our minds on some occasions,\r\nmakes them exert themselves with greater vigour and alacrity when they\r\nreturn to their proper and natural state.\r\n\r\nAs this innocent way of passing a leisure hour is not only consistent\r\nwith a great character, but very graceful in it, so there are two sorts\r\nof people to whom I would most earnestly recommend it. The first are\r\nthose who are uneasy out of want of thought; the second are those who\r\nare so out of a turbulence of spirit. The first are the impertinent,\r\nand the second the dangerous part of mankind.\r\n\r\nIt grieves me to the very heart when I see several young gentlemen,\r\ndescended of honest parents, run up and down hurrying from one end\r\nof the town to the other, calling in at every place of resort,\r\nwithout being able to fix a quarter of an hour in any, and in a\r\nparticular haste without knowing for what. It would (methinks) be some\r\nconsolation, if I could persuade these precipitate young gentlemen\r\nto compose this restlessness of mind, and apply themselves to any\r\namusement, how trivial soever, that might give them employment, and\r\nkeep them out of harm's way. They cannot imagine how great a relief it\r\nwould be to them if they could grow sedate enough to play for two or\r\nthree hours at a game of pushpin. But these busy, idle animals are only\r\ntheir own tormentors: the turbulent and dangerous are for embroiling\r\ncounsels, stirring up seditions, and subverting constitutions, out of a\r\nmere restlessness of temper, and an insensibility of all the pleasures\r\nof life that are calm and innocent. It is impossible for a man to be\r\nso much employed in any scene of action as to have great and good\r\naffairs enough to fill up his whole time; there will still be chasms\r\nand empty spaces, in which a working mind will employ itself to its own\r\nprejudice, or that of others, unless it can be at ease in the exercise\r\nof such actions as are in themselves indifferent. How often have I\r\nwished, for the good of the nation, that several famous politicians\r\ncould take any pleasure in feeding ducks. I look upon an able statesman\r\nout of business like a huge whale, that will endeavour to overturn the\r\nship unless he has an empty cask to play with.\r\n\r\nBut to return to my good friend and correspondent, I am afraid we shall\r\nboth be laughed at, when I confess, that we have often gone out into\r\nthe field to look upon a bird's nest; and have more than once taken an\r\nevening's walk together on purpose to see the sun set. I shall conclude\r\nwith my answer to his foregoing letter:\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"I thank you for your obliging letter, and your kindness to the\r\n     distressed, who will, doubtless, express their gratitude to you\r\n     themselves the next spring.

They both of them sit by my fire every night, expecting\r\n     my coming home with impatience; and at my entrance, never fail\r\n     of running up to me, and bidding me welcome, each of them in his\r\n     proper language. As they have been bred up together from their\r\n     infancy, and seen no other company, they have learned each other's\r\n     manners, so that the dog often gives himself the airs of a cat,\r\n     and the cat, in several of her motions and gestures, affects the\r\n     behaviour of the little dog. When they are at play, I often make\r\n     one with them; and sometimes please myself with considering, how\r\n     much reason and instinct are capable of delighting each other.\r\n     Thus, you see, I have communicated to you the material occurrences\r\n     in my family, with the same freedom that you use to me; as I am\r\n     with the same sincerity and affection,\r\n\r\n  \"Your most faithful,\r\n  Humble Servant,\r\n  ISAAC BICKERSTAFF.\"\r\n\r\n     #/\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[351] See No. 69.\r\n\r\n[352] No. 89.

[ADDISON and STEELE[364]\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, Dec. 29_, to _Saturday, Dec. 31, 1709_.\r\n\r\n    Ut in vitâ, sic in studiis, pulcherrimum et humanissimum existimo,\r\n        severitatem comitatemque miscere, ne illa in tristitiam, hæc in\r\n        petulantium procedat.--PLIN., Epist.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sheer Lane, Dec. 30._\r\n\r\nI was walking about my chamber this morning in a very gay humour, when\r\nI saw a coach stop at my door, and a youth about fifteen alighting\r\nout of it, whom I perceived to be the eldest son of my bosom friend\r\nthat I gave some account of in my paper of the 17th of the last\r\nmonth.[365] I felt a sensible pleasure rising in me at the sight of\r\nhim, my acquaintance having begun with his father when he was just\r\nsuch a stripling, and about that very age. When he came up to me, he\r\ntook me by the hand, and burst out in tears. I was extremely moved,\r\nand immediately said, \"Child, how does your father do?\" He began to\r\nreply, \"My mother--\" but could not go on for weeping. I went down with\r\nhim into the coach, and gathered out of him, that his mother was then\r\ndying, and that while the holy man was doing the last offices to her,\r\nhe had taken that time to come and call me to his father, who, he said,\r\nwould certainly break his heart if I did not go and comfort him. The\r\nchild's discretion in coming to me of his own head, and the tenderness\r\nhe showed for his parents, would have quite overpowered me, had I not\r\nresolved to fortify myself for the seasonable performances of those\r\nduties which I owed to my friend. As we were going, I could not but\r\nreflect upon the character of that excellent woman, and the greatness\r\nof his grief for the loss of one who has ever been the support to him\r\nunder all other afflictions. How, thought I, will he be able to bear\r\nthe hour of her death, that could not, when I was lately with him,\r\nspeak of a sickness, which was then past, without sorrow. We were now\r\ngot pretty far into Westminster, and arrived at my friend's house. At\r\nthe door of it I met Favonius,[366] not without a secret satisfaction\r\nto find he had been there. I had formerly conversed with him at this\r\nhouse; and as he abounds with that sort of virtue and knowledge which\r\nmakes religion beautiful, and never leads the conversation into the\r\nviolence and rage of party disputes, I listened to him with great\r\npleasure. Our discourse chanced to be upon the subject of death,\r\nwhich he treated with such a strength of reason, and greatness of\r\nsoul, that instead of being terrible, it appeared to a mind rightly\r\ncultivated, altogether to be contemned, or rather to be desired. As\r\nI met him at the door, I saw in his face a certain glowing of grief\r\nand humanity, heightened with an air of fortitude and resolution,\r\nwhich, as I afterwards found, had such an irresistible force, as to\r\nsuspend the pains of the dying, and the lamentation of the nearest\r\nfriends who attended her. I went up directly to the room where she\r\nlay, and was met at the entrance by my friend, who, notwithstanding\r\nhis thoughts had been composed a little before at the sight of me,\r\nturned away his face and wept. The little family of children renewed\r\nthe expressions of their sorrow according to their several ages and\r\ndegrees of understanding. The eldest daughter was in tears, busied in\r\nattendance upon her mother; others were kneeling about the bedside:\r\nand what troubled me most was, to see a little boy, who was too young\r\nto know the reason, weeping only because his sisters did. The only one\r\nin the room who seemed resigned and comforted, was the dying person.\r\nAt my approach to the bedside, she told me, with a low broken voice,\r\n\"This is kindly done. Take care of your friend--don't go from him.\"\r\nShe had before taken leave of her husband and children, in a manner\r\nproper for so solemn a parting, and with a gracefulness peculiar to a\r\nwoman of her character. My heart was torn in pieces to see the husband\r\non one side suppressing and keeping down the swellings of his grief,\r\nfor fear of disturbing her in her last moments; and the wife even at\r\nthat time concealing the pains she endured, for fear of increasing his\r\naffliction. She kept her eyes upon him for some moments after she grew\r\nspeechless, and soon after closed them for ever. In the moment of\r\nher departure, my friend (who had thus far commanded himself) gave a\r\ndeep groan, and fell into a swoon by her bedside.[367] The distraction\r\nof the children, who thought they saw both their parents expiring\r\ntogether, and now lying dead before them, would have melted the hardest\r\nheart; but they soon perceived their father recover, whom I helped to\r\nremove into another room, with a resolution to accompany him till the\r\nfirst pangs of his affliction were abated. I knew consolation would\r\nnow be impertinent; and therefore contented myself to sit by him, and\r\ncondole with him in silence. For I shall here use the method of an\r\nancient author,[368] who, in one of his epistles relating the virtues\r\nand death of Macrinus's wife, expresses himself thus:[369] \"I shall\r\nsuspend my advice to this best of friends, till he is made capable of\r\nreceiving it by those three great remedies (_necessitas ipsa_, _dies\r\nlonga_, _et satietas doloris_) the necessity of submission, length of\r\ntime, and satiety of grief.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I cannot but consider with much commiseration, the\r\nmelancholy state of one who has had such a part of himself torn from\r\nhim, and which he misses in every circumstance of life. His condition\r\nis like that of one who has lately lost his right arm, and is every\r\nmoment offering to help himself with it. He does not appear to\r\nhimself the same person in his house, at his table, in company, or in\r\nretirement; and loses the relish of all the pleasures and diversions\r\nthat were before entertaining to him by her participation of them. The\r\nmost agreeable objects recall the sorrow for her with whom he used to\r\nenjoy them. This additional satisfaction, from the taste of pleasures\r\nin the society of one we love, is admirably described in Milton, who\r\nrepresents Eve, though in Paradise itself, no further pleased with the\r\nbeautiful objects around her than as she sees them in company with\r\nAdam, in that passage so inexpressibly charming.\r\n\r\n    \"_With thee conversing, I forget all time,\r\n    All seasons, and their change; all please alike.\r\n    Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet\r\n    With charm of earliest birds; pleasant the sun,\r\n    When first on this delightful land he spreads\r\n    His orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flower,\r\n    Glist'ring with dew; fragrant the fertile earth\r\n    After soft showers, and sweet the coming on\r\n    Of grateful evening mild; the silent night,\r\n    With this her solemn bird, and this fair moon,\r\n    And these the gems of heaven her starry train.\r\n    But neither breath of morn when she ascends\r\n    With charm of earliest birds, nor rising sun\r\n    In this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, flower,\r\n    Glist'ring with dew, nor fragrance after showers,\r\n    Nor grateful evening mild, nor silent night,\r\n    With this her solemn bird, nor walk by moon,\r\n    Or glittering star-light, without thee is sweet._\"[370]\r\n\r\nThe variety of images in this passage is infinitely pleasing, and the\r\nrecapitulation of each particular image, with a little varying of\r\nthe expression, makes one of the finest turns of words that I have\r\never seen; which I rather mention, because Mr. Dryden has said in\r\nhis preface to Juvenal, that he could meet with no turn of words in\r\nMilton.[371]\r\n\r\nIt may further be observed, that though the sweetness of these verses\r\nhas something in it of a pastoral, yet it excels the ordinary kind,\r\nas much as the scene of it is above an ordinary field or meadow.\r\nI might here, since I am accidentally led into this subject, show\r\nseveral passages in Milton that have as excellent turns of this nature\r\nas any of our English poets whatsoever; but shall only mention that\r\nwhich follows, in which he describes the fallen angels engaged in the\r\nintricate disputes of predestination, free-will, and foreknowledge; and\r\nto humour the perplexity, makes a kind of labyrinth in the very words\r\nthat describe it:\r\n\r\n    _Others apart sat on a hill retired,\r\n    In thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high\r\n    Of Providence, foreknowledge, will and fate,\r\n    Fixed fate, free-will, foreknowledge absolute,\r\n    And found no end in wandering mazes lost._[372]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[363] Story's Gate and Rosamond's Pond were at opposite ends of\r\nBirdcage Walk (see No. 60).\r\n\r\n[364] \"Steele assisted in this paper\" (Tickell).\r\n\r\n[365] No. 95.\r\n\r\n[366] Dr. Smalridge (see No. 72).\r\n\r\n[367] What follows is said to have been written by Addison. \"It would\r\nseem as though Steele felt himself unable to proceed, and his friend\r\nhad taken the pen from his trembling hand\" (Forster, \"Historical and\r\nBiographical Essays,\" 1858, ii. 141).\r\n\r\n[368] Pliny, Book viii., Epist. 5.\r\n\r\n[369] \"Says very justly\" (folio).\r\n\r\n[370] \"Paradise Lost,\" iv. 639.\r\n\r\n[371] \"But as he [Milton] endeavours everywhere to express Homer,\r\nwhose age had not arrived to that fineness, I found in him a true\r\nsublimity, lofty thoughts which were clothed with admirable Grecisms,\r\nand ancient words which he had been digging from the mines of Chaucer\r\nand of Spenser, and which, with all their rusticity, had somewhat of\r\nvenerable in them.
