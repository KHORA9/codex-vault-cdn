Has not Boucher immortalized the\r\ngood-natured, rather weak face, with that perpetual smile of unruffled\r\namiability forever lurking round the corners of the full-lipped mouth?\r\n\r\n\"Your commands, sire?\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes--gray and prominent--roamed with a rapid movement of enquiry\r\nfrom the face of the king to that of a young man with fair, curly\r\nhair, worn free from powder, and eyes restless and blue, which stared\r\nmoodily into a goblet full of wine.\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary silence in the vast and magnificent dining hall,\r\nthat sudden hush which--so the superstitious aver--descends three\r\ntimes on every assembly, however gay, however brilliant or\r\nthoughtless: the hush which to the imaginative mind suggests the\r\nflutter of unseen wings.\r\n\r\nThen the silence was broken by loud laughter from the King.\r\n\r\n\"They are mad, these English, my friend! What?\" said Louis the\r\nWell-beloved with a knowing wink directed at the fair-haired young man\r\nwho sat not far from him.\r\n\r\n\"Mad, indeed, sire?\" replied the Duke. \"But surely not more\r\nconspicuously so to-night than at any other time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of a truth, a hundred thousand times more so,\" here interposed a\r\nsomewhat shrill feminine voice--\"and that by the most rigid rules of\r\nbrain-splitting arithmetic!\"\r\n\r\nEveryone listened. Conversations were interrupted; glasses were put\r\ndown; eager, attentive faces turned toward the speaker; this was no\r\nless a personage than Jeanne Poisson now Marquise de Pompadour; and\r\nwhen she opened her pretty mouth Louis the Well-beloved, descendant of\r\nSaint Louis, King of France and of all her dominions beyond the seas,\r\nhung breathless upon those well-rouged lips, whilst France sat silent\r\nand listened, eager for a share of that smile which enslaved a King\r\nand ruined a nation.\r\n\r\n\"Let us have that rigid rule of arithmetic, fair one,\" said Louis\r\ngaily, \"by which you can demonstrate to us that M. le Chevalier here\r\nis a hundred thousand times more mad than any of his accursed\r\ncountrymen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, sire, 'tis simple enough,\" rejoined the lady. \"M. le Chevalier\r\nhath need of a hundred thousand others in order to make his insanity\r\ncomplete, a hundred thousand Englishmen as mad as April fishes, to\r\nhelp him conquer a kingdom of rain and fogs. Therefore I say he is a\r\nhundred thousand times more mad than most!\"\r\n\r\nLoud laughter greeted this sally. Mme. la Marquise de Pompadour, so\r\nlittle while ago simply Jeanne Poisson or Mme. d'Étioles, was not yet\r\n_blasée_ to so much adulation and such fulsome flattery; she looked a\r\nveritable heaven of angelic smiles; her eyes blue--so her dithyrambic\r\nchroniclers aver--as the dark-toned myosotis, wandered from face to\r\nface along the length of that gorgeously spread supper table, round\r\nwhich was congregated the flower of the old aristocracy of France.\r\n\r\nShe gleaned an admiring glance here, an unspoken murmur of flattery\r\nthere, even the women--and there were many--tried to look approvingly\r\nat her who ruled the King and France. One face alone remained\r\ninscrutable and almost severe, the face of a woman--a mere girl--with\r\nstraight brow and low, square forehead, crowned with a wealth of soft\r\nbrown hair, the rich tones of which peeped daringly through the\r\nconventional mist of powder.\r\n\r\nMme. de Pompadour's sunny smile disappeared momentarily when her eyes\r\nrested on this girl's face; a frown--oh! hardly that; but a shadow,\r\nshall we say?--marred the perfect purity of her brow. The next moment\r\nshe had yielded her much-beringed hand to her royal worshipper's\r\neager grasp and he was pressing a kiss on each rose-tipped finger,\r\nwhilst she shrugged her pretty shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Brrr!\" she said, with a mock shiver, \"here is Mlle. d'Aumont frowning\r\nstern disapproval at me. Surely, Chevalier,\" she asked, turning to the\r\nyoung man beside her, \"a comfortable armchair in your beautiful palace\r\nof St. Germain is worth a throne in mist-bound London?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not when that throne is his by right,\" here interposed Mlle. d'Aumont\r\nquietly. \"The palace of St. Germain is but a gift to the King of\r\nEngland, for which he owes gratitude to the King of France.\"\r\n\r\nA quick blush now suffused the cheeks of the young man, who up to now\r\nhad seemed quite unconscious of Mme. de Pompadour's sallies or of the\r\nhilarity directed against himself. He gave a rapid glance at Mlle.\r\nd'Aumont's haughty, somewhat imperious face and at the delicate mouth,\r\nround which an almost imperceptible curl of contempt seemed still to\r\nlinger.\r\n\r\n\"La! Mademoiselle,\" rejoined the Marquise, with some acerbity, \"do we\r\nnot all hold gifts at the hands of the King of France?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have no sovereignty of our own, Madame,\" replied the young girl\r\ndrily.\r\n\r\n\"As for me,\" quoth King Louis, hastily interposing in this feminine\r\npassage of arms, \"I drink to our gallant Chevalier de St. George, His\r\nMajesty King Charles Edward Stuart of England, Scotland, Wales, and of\r\nthe whole of that fog-ridden kingdom. Success to your cause,\r\nChevalier,\" he added, settling his fat body complacently in the\r\ncushions of his chair; and raising his glass, he nodded benignly\r\ntoward the young Pretender.\r\n\r\n\"To King Charles Edward of England!\" rejoined Mme. de Pompadour gaily.\r\n\r\nAnd \"To King Charles Edward of England!\" went echoing all around the\r\nvast banqueting-hall.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you all,\" said the young man, whose sullen mood seemed in no\r\nway dissipated at these expressions of graciousness and friendship.\r\n\"Success to my cause is assured if France will lend me the aid she\r\npromised.\"\r\n\r\n\"What right have you to doubt the word of France, Monseigneur?\"\r\nretorted Mlle. d'Aumont earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"A truce! a truce! I entreat,\" here broke in King Louis with mock\r\nconcern. \"_Par Dieu_, this is a banquet and not a Council Chamber! Joy\r\nof my life,\" he added, turning eyes replete with admiration on the\r\nbeautiful woman beside him, \"do not allow politics to mar this\r\npleasant entertainment. M. le Duc, you are our host, I pray you direct\r\nconversation into more pleasing channels.\"\r\n\r\nNothing loth, the brilliant company there present quickly resumed the\r\nirresponsible chatter which was far more to its liking than talk of\r\nthrones and doubtful causes. The flunkeys in gorgeous liveries made\r\nthe round of the table, filling the crystal glasses with wine. The\r\natmosphere was heavy with the fumes of past good cheer, and the scent\r\nof a thousand roses fading beneath the glare of innumerable\r\nwax-candles. An odour of perfume, of powder and cosmetics hovered in\r\nthe air; the men's faces looked red and heated; on one or two heads\r\nthe wig stood awry, whilst trembling fingers began fidgeting with the\r\nlace-cravats at the throat.\r\n\r\nCharles Edward's restless blue eyes searched keenly and feverishly the\r\nfaces around him; morose, gloomy, he was still reckoning in his mind\r\nhow far he could trust these irresponsible pleasure-lovers, that\r\ndescendant of the great Louis over there, fat of body and heavy of\r\nmind, lost to all sense of kingly dignity whilst squandering the\r\nnation's money on the whims and caprices of the ex-wife of a Parisian\r\nvictualler, whom he had created Marquise de Pompadour.\r\n\r\nThese men who lived only for good cheer, for heady wines, games of\r\ndice and hazard, nights of debauch and illicit pleasures, what help\r\nwould they be to him in the hour of need? What support in case of\r\nfailure?\r\n\r\n\"What right have you to doubt the word of France?\" was asked of him by\r\none pair of proud lips--a woman's, only a girl's.\r\n\r\nCharles Edward looked across the table at Mlle. d'Aumont. Like\r\nhimself, she sat silent in the midst of the noisy throng, obviously\r\nlending a very inattentive ear to the whisperings of the handsome\r\ncavalier beside her.\r\n\r\nAh! if they were all like her, if she were a representative of the\r\nwhole nation of France, the young adventurer would have gone to his\r\nhazardous expedition with a stauncher and a lighter heart. But, as\r\nmatters stood, what could he expect? What had he got as a serious\r\nasset in this gamble for life and a throne? A few vague promises from\r\nthat flabby, weak-kneed creature over there on whom the crown of Saint\r\nLouis sat so strangely and so ill; a few smiles from that frivolous\r\nand vain woman, who drained the very heart's blood of an impoverished\r\nnation to its last drop, in order to satisfy her costly whims or chase\r\naway the frowns of ennui from the brow of an effete monarch.\r\n\r\nAnd what besides?\r\n\r\nA farewell supper, ringing toasts, good wine, expensive food offered\r\nby M. le Duc d'Aumont, the Prime Minister of France--a thousand roses,\r\nnow fading, which had cost a small fortune to coax into bloom; a\r\nhandshake from his friends in France; a \"God-speed\" and \"_Dieu vous\r\ngarde_, Chevalier!\" and a few words of stern encouragement from a\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\nWith all that in hand, Chevalier St. George, go and conquer your\r\nkingdom beyond the sea!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE RULERS OF FRANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat activity reigned in the corridors and kitchens of the old\r\nchâteau. M. le Chef--the only true rival the immortal Vatel ever\r\nhad--in white cap and apron, calm and self-possessed as a\r\nfield-marshal in the hour of victory, and surrounded by an army of\r\nscullions and wenches, was directing the operations of dishing-up--the\r\ncrowning glory of his arduous labours. Pies and patties, haunches of\r\nvenison, trout and carp from the Rhine were placed on gold and silver\r\ndishes and adorned with tasteful ornaments of truly architectural\r\nbeauty and monumental proportions. These were then handed over to the\r\nfootmen, who, resplendent in gorgeous liveries of scarlet and azure,\r\nhurried along the marble passages carrying the masterpieces of\r\nculinary art to the banqueting-hall beyond, whilst the butlers, more\r\nsedate and dignified in sober garb of puce or brown, stalked along in\r\nstately repose bearing the huge tankards and crystal jugs.\r\n\r\nAll of the best that the fine old Château d'Aumont could provide was\r\nbeing requisitioned to-night, since M. le Duc and Mlle. Lydie, his\r\ndaughter, were giving a farewell banquet to Charles Edward Stuart by\r\nthe grace of God--if not by the will of the people--King of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland and all her dependencies beyond the seas.\r\n\r\nFor him speeches were made, toasts drunk and glasses raised; for him\r\nthe ducal veneries had been ransacked, the ducal cellars shorn of\r\ntheir most ancient possessions; for him M. le Chef had raged and\r\nstormed for five hours, had expended the sweat of his brow and the\r\nintricacies of his brain; for him the scullions' backs had smarted,\r\nthe wenches' cheeks had glowed, all to do honour to the only rightful\r\nKing of England about to quit the hospitable land of France in order\r\nto conquer that island kingdom which his grandfather had lost.\r\n\r\nBut in the noble _salle d'armes_, on the other hand, there reigned a\r\npompous and dignified silence, in strange contrast to the bustle and\r\nagitation of the kitchens and the noise of loud voices and laughter\r\nthat issued from the banqueting hall whenever a door was opened and\r\nquickly shut again.\r\n\r\nHere perfumed candles flickered in massive candelabra, shedding dim\r\ncircles of golden light on carved woodwork, marble floor, and\r\ndull-toned tapestries. The majestic lions of D'Aumont frowned stolidly\r\nfrom their high pedestals on this serene abode of peace and dignity,\r\none foot resting on the gilded shield with the elaborate coat-of-arms\r\nblazoned thereon in scarlet and azure, the other poised aloft as if in\r\nsolemn benediction.\r\n\r\nM. Joseph, own body servant to M. le Duc, in magnificent D'Aumont\r\nlivery, his cravat a marvel of costly simplicity, his elegant,\r\nwell-turned calves--encased in fine silk stockings--stretched lazily\r\nbefore him, was sprawling on the brocade-covered divan in the centre\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\nM. Bénédict, equally resplendent in a garb of motley that recalled the\r\nheraldic colours of the Comte de Stainville, stood before him, not in\r\nan attitude of deference of course, but in one of easy friendship;\r\nwhilst M. Achille--a blaze of scarlet and gold--was holding out an\r\nelegant silver snuff-box to M. Joseph, who, without any superfluous\r\nmotion of his dignified person, condescended to take a pinch.\r\n\r\nWith arm and elbow held at a graceful angle, M. Joseph paused in the\r\nvery act of conveying the snuff to his delicate nostrils. He seemed to\r\nthink that the occasion called for a remark from himself, but\r\nevidently nothing very appropriate occurred to him for the moment, so\r\nafter a few seconds of impressive silence he finally partook of the\r\nsnuff, and then flicked off the grains of dust from his immaculate\r\nazure waistcoat with a lace-edged handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\"Where does your Marquis get his snuff?\" he asked with an easy\r\ngraciousness of manner.\r\n\r\n\"We get it direct from London,\" replied M. Achille sententiously. \"I\r\nam personally acquainted with Mme. Véronique, who is cook to Mme. de\r\nla Beaume and the sweetheart of Jean Laurent, own body-servant to\r\nGeneral de Puisieux. The old General is Chief of Customs at Havre, so\r\nyou see we pay no duty and get the best of snuff at a ridiculous\r\nprice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that's lucky for you, my good Eglinton,\" said M. Bénédict, with a\r\nsigh. \"Your Marquis is a good sort, and as he is not personally\r\nacquainted with Mme. Véronique, I doubt not but he pays full price for\r\nhis snuff.\"\r\n\r\n\"One has to live, friend Stainville,\" quoth Achille solemnly--\"and I\r\nam not a fool!\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly so; and with an English milor your life is an easy one,\r\nMonsieur.\"\r\n\r\n\"Comme-ci! comme-ça!\" nodded Achille deprecatingly.\r\n\r\n\"Le petit Anglais is very rich?\" suggested Bénédict.\r\n\r\n\"Boundlessly so!\" quoth the other, with conscious pride.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if perchance you could see your way to introducing me to Mme.\r\nVéronique. Eh? I have to pay full price for my Count's snuff, and he\r\nwill have none but the best; but if I could get Mme. Véronique's\r\nprotection----\"\r\n\r\nAchille's manner immediately changed at this suggestion, made with\r\nbecoming diffidence; he drew back a few steps as if to emphasize the\r\ndistance which must of necessity lie between supplicant and patron. He\r\ntook a pinch of snuff, he blew his nose with stately deliberation--all\r\nin order to keep the petitioner waiting on tenterhooks.\r\n\r\nFinally he drew up his scarlet and gold shoulders until they almost\r\ntouched his ears.\r\n\r\n\"It will be difficult, very, very difficult my good Stainville,\" he\r\nsaid at last, speaking in measured tones. \"You see, Mme. Véronique is\r\nin a very delicate position; she has a great deal of influence of\r\ncourse, and it is not easy to obtain her protection. Still, I will see\r\nwhat I can do, and you can place your petition before her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not worry yourself, my good Eglinton,\" here interposed M. Bénédict\r\nwith becoming hauteur. \"I thought as you had asked me yesterday to use\r\nmy influence with our Mlle. Mariette, the fiancée of Colonel\r\nJauffroy's third footman, with regard to your nephew's advancement in\r\nhis regiment, that perhaps---- But no matter--no matter!\" he added,\r\nwith a deprecatory wave of the hand.\r\n\r\n\"You completely misunderstood me, my dear Stainville,\" broke in M.\r\nAchille, eagerly. \"I said that the matter was difficult; I did not say\r\nthat it was impossible. Mme. Véronique is beset with petitions, but\r\nyou may rely on my friendship. I will obtain the necessary\r\nintroduction for you if you, on the other hand, will bear my nephew's\r\ninterests in mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say no more about it, my good Eglinton,\" said Bénédict, with easy\r\ncondescension; \"your nephew will get his promotion on the word of a\r\nStainville.\"\r\n\r\nPeace and amity being once more restored between the two friends, M.\r\nJoseph thought that he had now remained silent far longer than was\r\ncompatible with his own importance.\r\n\r\n\"It is very difficult, of course, in our position,\" he said pompously,\r\n\"to do justice to the many demands which are made on our influence and\r\npatronage. Take my own case, for instance--my Duke leaves all\r\nappointments in my hands. In the morning, whilst I shave him, I have\r\nbut to mention a name to him in connection with any post under\r\nGovernment that happens to be vacant, and immediately the favoured\r\none, thus named by me, receives attention, nearly always followed by a\r\nnomination.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hem! hem!\" came very discreetly from the lips of M. Bénédict.\r\n\r\n\"You said?\" queried Joseph, with a slight lifting of the right\r\neyebrow.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! nothing--nothing! I pray you continue; the matter is vastly\r\nentertaining.\"\r\n\r\n\"At the present moment,\" continued M. Joseph, keeping a suspicious eye\r\non the other man, \"I am deeply worried by this proposal which comes\r\nfrom the Parliaments of Rennes and Paris.\"\r\n\r\n\"A new Ministry of Finance to be formed,\" quoth M. Achille. \"We know\r\nall about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"With direct control of the nation's money and responsible to the\r\nParliaments alone,\" assented Joseph. \"The Parliaments! Bah!\" he added\r\nin tones of supreme contempt, \"_bourgeois_ the lot of them!\"\r\n\r\n\"Their demands are preposterous, so says my milor. 'Tis a marvel His\r\nMajesty has given his consent.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have advised my Duke not to listen to the rabble,\" said Joseph, as\r\nhe readjusted the set of his cravat. \"A Ministry responsible to the\r\nParliaments! Ridiculous, I say!\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand, though,\" here interposed M. Achille, \"that the\r\nParliaments, out of deference for His Majesty are willing that the\r\nKing himself shall appoint this new Comptroller of Finance.\"\r\n\r\n\"The King, my good Eglinton,\" calmly retorted M. Joseph--\"the King\r\nwill leave this matter to us. You may take it from me that we shall\r\nappoint this new Minister, and an extremely pleasant post it will be.\r\nComptroller of Finance! All the taxes to pass through the Minister's\r\nhands! Par Dieu! does it not open out a wide field for an ambitious\r\nman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hem! hem!\" coughed M. Bénédict again.\r\n\r\n\"You seem to be suffering from a cold, sir,\" said M. Joseph irritably.\r\n\r\n\"Not in the least,\" rejoined Bénédict hastily--\"a slight tickling in\r\nthe throat. You were saying, M. Joseph, that you hoped this new\r\nappointment would fall within your sphere of influence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay! If you doubt me, my good Stainville----\" And M. Joseph rose with\r\nslow and solemn majesty from the divan, where he had been reclining,\r\nand walking across the room with a measured step, he reached an\r\nescritoire whereon ink and pens, letters tied up in bundles, loose\r\npapers, and all the usual paraphernalia commonly found on the desk of\r\na busy man. M. Joseph sat down at the table and rang a handbell.\r\n\r\nThe next moment a young footman entered, silent and deferential.\r\n\r\n\"Is any one in the ante-room, Paul?\" asked Joseph.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, M. Joseph.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many?\"\r\n\r\n\"About thirty persons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go tell them, then, that M. Joseph is not receiving to-night. He is\r\nentertaining a circle of friends. Bring me all written petitions. I\r\nshall be visible in my dressing room to those who have a personal\r\nintroduction at eleven o'clock to-morrow. You may go!\"\r\n\r\nSilently as he had entered, the young man bowed and withdrew.\r\n\r\nM. Joseph wheeled round in his chair and turned to his friends with a\r\nlook of becoming triumph.\r\n\r\n\"Thirty persons!\" he remarked simply.\r\n\r\n\"All after this appointment?\" queried Achille.\r\n\r\n\"Their representatives, you see,\" explained M. Joseph airily. \"Oh! my\r\nante-chamber is always full--You understand? I shave my Duke every\r\nmorning; and every one, it seems to me, is wanting to control the\r\nfinances of France.\"\r\n\r\n\"Might one inquire who is your special _protégé_?\" asked the other.\r\n\r\n\"Time will show,\" came with cryptic vagueness from the lips of M.\r\nJoseph.\r\n\r\n\"Hem! hem!\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to a slight tickling of the throat, M. Bénédict seemed to\r\nbe suffering from an affection of the left eye which caused him to\r\nwink with somewhat persistent emphasis:\r\n\r\n\"This is the third time you have made that remark, Stainville,\" said\r\nJoseph severely.\r\n\r\n\"I did not remark, my dear D'Aumont,\" rejoined Bénédict\r\npleasantly--\"that is, I merely said 'Hem! hem!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Even so, I heard you,\" said Joseph, with some acerbity; \"and I would\r\nwish to know precisely what you meant when you said 'Hem! hem!' like\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking of Mlle. Lucienne,\" said Bénédict, with a sentimental\r\nsigh.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! I am one of her sweethearts--the fourth in point of favour.\r\nMlle. Lucienne has your young lady's ear, my good D'Aumont, and we all\r\nknow that your Duke governs the whole of France exactly as his\r\ndaughter wishes him to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you hope through Mlle. Lucienne's influence to obtain the new\r\npost of Comptroller for your own Count?\" asked M. Joseph, with assumed\r\ncarelessness, as he drummed a devil's tattoo on the table before him.\r\n\r\nA slight expression of fatuity crept into the countenance of M.\r\nBénédict. He did not wish to irritate the great man; at the same time\r\nhe felt confident in his own powers of blandishments where Mlle.\r\nLucienne was concerned, even though he only stood fourth in point of\r\nfavour in that influential lady's heart.\r\n\r\n\"Mlle. Lucienne has promised us her support,\" he said, with a\r\ncomplacent smile.\r\n\r\n\"I fear me that will be of little avail,\" here interposed M. Achille.\r\n\"We have on our side, the influence of Mme. Auguste Baillon, who is\r\nhousekeeper to M. le Docteur Dubois, consulting physician to Mlle.\r\nd'Aumont. M. le Docteur is very fond of haricots cooked in lard--a\r\ndish in the preparation of which Mme. Baillon excels--whilst, on the\r\nother hand, that lady's son is perruquier to my Eglinton. I think\r\nthere is no doubt that ours is the stronger influence, and that if\r\nthis Ministry of Finance comes into being, we shall be the Chief\r\nComptroller.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it will come into being, without any doubt,\" said Bénédict. \"I\r\nhave it from my cousin François, who is one of the sweethearts of\r\nMlle. Duprez, confidential maid to Mme. Aremberg, the jeweller's wife,\r\nthat the merchants of Paris and Lyons are not at all pleased with the\r\namount of money which the King and Mme. de Pompadour are spending.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly! People of that sort are a veritable pestilence. They want us\r\nto pay some of the taxes--the _corvée_ or the _taille_. As if a Duke\r\nor a Minister is going to pay taxes! Ridiculous!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ridiculous, I say,\" assented Achille, \"though my Marquis says that in\r\nEngland even noblemen pay taxes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we'll not go to England, friend Eglinton. Imagine shaving a Duke\r\nor a Marquis who had paid taxes like a shopkeeper!\"\r\n\r\nA chorus of indignation from the three gentleman rose at the\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n\"Preposterous indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"We all know that England is a nation of shopkeepers. M. de Voltaire,\r\nwho has been there, said so to us on his return.\"\r\n\r\nM. Achille, in view of the fact that he represented the Marquis of\r\nEglinton, commonly styled \"le petit Anglais,\" was not quite sure\r\nwhether his dignity demanded that he should resent this remark of M.\r\nde Voltaire's or not.\r\n\r\nFortunately he was saved from having to decide this delicate question\r\nimmediately by the reëntry of Paul into the room.\r\n\r\nThe young footman was carrying a bundle of papers, which he\r\nrespectfully presented to M. Joseph on a silver tray. The great man\r\nlooked at Paul somewhat puzzled, rubbed his chin, and contemplated the\r\npapers with a thoughtful eye.\r\n\r\n\"What are these?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"The petitions, M. Joseph,\" replied the young man.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Ah, yes!\" quoth the other airily. \"Quite so; but--I have no time\r\nto read them now. You may glance through them, Paul, and let me know\r\nif any are worthy of my consideration.\"\r\n\r\nM. Joseph was born in an epoch when reading was not considered an\r\nindispensable factor in a gentleman's education. Whether the petitions\r\nof the thirty aspirants to the new post of Comptroller of Finance\r\nwould subsequently be read by M. Paul or not it were impossible to\r\nsay; for the present he merely took up the papers again, saying quite\r\nrespectfully:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, M. Joseph.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay! you may take cards, dice, and two flagons of Bordeaux into my\r\nboudoir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, M. Joseph.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you dismissed every one from the ante-chamber?\"\r\n\r\n\"All except an old man, who refuses to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know; he----\"\r\n\r\nFurther explanation was interrupted by a timid voice issuing from the\r\nopen door.\r\n\r\n\"I only desire five minutes' conversation with M. le Duc d'Aumont.\"\r\n\r\nAnd a wizened little figure dressed in seedy black, with lean shanks\r\nencased in coarse woollen stockings, shuffled into the room. He seemed\r\nto be carrying a great number of papers and books under both arms, and\r\nas he stepped timidly forward some of these tumbled in a heap at his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\"Only five minutes' conversation with M. le Duc.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes were very pale, and very watery, and his hair was of a pale\r\nstraw colour. He stooped to pick up his papers, and dropped others in\r\nthe process.\r\n\r\n\"M. le Duc is not visible,\" said M. Joseph majestically.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps a little later----\" suggested the lean individual.\r\n\r\n\"The Duke will not be visible later either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then to-morrow perhaps; I can wait--I have plenty of time on my\r\nhands.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may have, but the Duke hasn't.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the wizened little man had succeeded in once more\r\ncollecting his papers together. With trembling eager hands he now\r\nselected a folded note, which evidently had suffered somewhat through\r\nfrequent falls on dusty floors; this he held out toward M. Joseph.\r\n\r\n\"I have a letter to Monsieur le valet de chambre of the Duke,\" he said\r\nhumbly.\r\n\r\n\"A letter of introduction?--to me?\" queried Joseph, with a distinct\r\nchange in his manner and tone. \"From whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"My daughter Agathe, who brings Monsieur's chocolate in to him every\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you are Mlle. Agathe's father!\" exclaimed Joseph with pleasant\r\ncondescension, as he took the letter of introduction, and, without\r\nglancing at it, slipped it into the pocket of his magnificent coat.\r\nPerhaps a thought subsequently crossed his mind that the timorous\r\nperson before him was not quite so simple-minded as his watery blue\r\neyes suggested, and that the dusty and crumpled little note might be a\r\ndaring fraud practised on his own influential personality, for he\r\nadded with stern emphasis: \"I will see Mlle. Agathe to-morrow, and\r\nwill discuss your affair with her.\"\r\n\r\nThen, as the little man did not wince under the suggestion, M. Joseph\r\nsaid more urbanely:\r\n\r\n\"By the way, what is your affair? These gentlemen\"--and with a\r\ngraceful gesture he indicated his two friends--\"these gentlemen will\r\npardon the liberty you are taking in discussing it before them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Monsieur; thank you, gentlemen,\" said the wizened\r\nindividual humbly; \"it is a matter of--er--figures.\"\r\n\r\n\"Figures!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! This new Ministry of Finance--there will be an auditor of\r\naccounts wanted--several auditors, I presume--and--and I thought----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" nodded M. Joseph graciously.\r\n\r\n\"My daughter does bring you in your chocolate nice and hot, M. Joseph,\r\ndoes she not?--and--and I do know a lot about figures. I studied\r\nmathematics with the late M. Descartes; I audited the books of the\r\nSociété des Comptables of Lyons for several years; and--and I have\r\ndiplomas and testimonials----\"\r\n\r\nAnd, carried away by another wave of anxiety, he began to fumble among\r\nhis papers and books, which with irritating perversity immediately\r\ntumbled pell-mell on to the floor.\r\n\r\n\"What in the devil's name is the good of testimonials and diplomas to\r\nus, my good man?\" said M. Joseph haughtily. \"If, on giving the matter\r\nmy serious consideration, I come to the conclusion that you will be a\r\nsuitable accountant in the new Ministerial Department, _ma foi_! my\r\ngood man, your affair is settled. No thanks, I pray!\" he added, with a\r\ngracious flourish of the arm; \"I have been pleased with Mlle. Agathe,\r\nand I may mention your name whilst I shave M. le Duc to-morrow. Er--by\r\nthe way, what is your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Durand, if you please, M. Joseph.\"\r\n\r\nThe meagre little person with the watery blue eyes tried to express\r\nhis gratitude by word and gesture, but his books and papers encumbered\r\nhis movements, and he was rendered doubly nervous by the presence of\r\nthese gorgeous and stately gentlemen, and by the wave of voices and\r\nlaughter which suddenly rose from the distance, suggesting that\r\nperhaps a brilliant company might be coming this way.\r\n\r\nThe very thought seemed to completely terrify him; with both arms he\r\nhugged his various written treasures, and with many sideway bows and\r\nmurmurs of thanks he finally succeeded in shuffling his lean figure\r\nout of the room, closely followed by M. Paul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPOMPADOUR'S CHOICE\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Durand's retreat had fortunately occurred just in time; men's\r\nvoices and women's laughter sounded more and more distinct, as if\r\napproaching toward the _salle d'armes_.\r\n\r\nIn a moment, with the swiftness born of long usage, the demeanour of\r\nthe three gentlemen underwent a quick and sudden change. They seemed\r\nto pull their gorgeous figures together; with practised fingers each\r\nreadjusted the lace of his cravat, reëstablished the correct set of\r\nhis waistcoat, and flickered the last grain of dust or snuff from the\r\nsatin-like surface of his coat.\r\n\r\nTen seconds later the great doors at the east end of the hall were\r\nthrown open, and through the embrasure and beyond the intervening\r\nmarble corridor could be seen the brilliantly lighted supper-room,\r\nwith its glittering company broken up into groups.\r\n\r\nSilent, swift and deferential, MM. Joseph, Bénédict, and Achille\r\nglided on flat-heeled shoes along the slippery floors, making as\r\nlittle noise as possible, effacing their gorgeous persons in window\r\nrecesses or carved ornaments whenever a knot of gentlemen or ladies\r\nhappened to pass by.\r\n\r\nQuite a different trio now, MM. Joseph, Bénédict, and Achille--just\r\nthree automatons intent on their duties.\r\n\r\nFrom the supper-room there came an incessant buzz of talk and\r\nlaughter. M. Joseph sought his master's eye, but M. le Duc was busy\r\nwith the King of England and wanted no service; M. Achille found his\r\nEnglish milor, \"le petit Anglais,\" engaged in conversation with his\r\nportly and somewhat overdressed mamma; whilst M. Bénédict's master was\r\nnowhere to be found.\r\n\r\nThe older ladies were beginning to look wearied and hot, smothering\r\nyawns behind their painted fans. Paniers assumed a tired and crumpled\r\nappearance, and feathered aigrettes nodded dismally above the high\r\ncoiffures.\r\n\r\nNot a few of the guests had taken the opportunity of bringing cards or\r\ndice from a silken pocket, whilst others in smaller groups, younger\r\nand not yet wearied of desultory talk, strolled toward the _salle\r\nd'armes_ or the smaller boudoirs which opened out of the corridor.\r\n\r\nOne or two gentlemen had succumbed to M. le Duc's lavish hospitality;\r\nthe many toasts had proved too exacting, the copious draughts\r\naltogether too heady, and they had, somewhat involuntarily, exchanged\r\ntheir chairs for the more reliable solidity of the floor, where their\r\nfaithful attendants, stationed under the table for the purpose, deftly\r\nuntied a cravat which might be too tight or administered such cooling\r\nantidotes as might be desirable.\r\n\r\nThe hot air vibrated with the constant babel of voices, the frou-frou\r\nof silk paniers, and brocaded skirts, mingled with the clink of swords\r\nand the rattle of dice in satinwood boxes.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere, surcharged with perfumes, had become overpoweringly\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty, flushed with wine, and with drowsy lids drooping over his\r\ndulled eyes, had pushed his chair away from the table and was\r\nlounging lazily toward Mme. de Pompadour, his idle fingers toying with\r\nthe jewelled girdle of her fan. She amused him; she had quaint sayings\r\nwhich were sometimes witty, always daring, but which succeeded in\r\ndissipating momentarily that mortal ennui of which he suffered.\r\n\r\nEven now her whispered conversation, interspersed with profuse\r\ngiggles, brought an occasional smile to the lips of the sleepy\r\nmonarch. She chatted and laughed, flirting her fan, humouring the\r\neffeminate creature beside her by yielding her hand and wrist to his\r\nflabby kisses. But her eyes did not rest on him for many seconds at a\r\ntime; she talked to Louis, but her mind had gone a-wandering about the\r\nroom trying to read thoughts, to search motives or divine hidden\r\nhatreds and envy as they concerned herself.\r\n\r\nThis glitter was still new to her; the power which she wielded seemed\r\nas yet a brittle toy which a hasty movement might suddenly break. It\r\nwas but a very little while ago that she had been an insignificant\r\nunit in a third-rate social circle of Paris--always beautiful, but\r\nlost in the midst of a drabby crowd, her charms, like those of a\r\nprecious stone, unperceived for want of proper setting. Her ambition\r\nwas smothered in her heart, which at times it almost threatened to\r\nconsume. But it was always there, ever since she had learnt to\r\nunderstand the power which beauty gives.\r\n\r\nAn approving smile from the King of France, and the world wore a\r\ndifferent aspect for Jeanne Poisson. Her whims and caprices became the\r\nreins with which she drove France and the King. Why place a limit to\r\nher own desires, since the mightiest monarch in Europe was ready to\r\ngratify them?\r\n\r\nMoney became her god.\r\n\r\nSpend! spend! spend! Why not? The nation, the bourgeoisie--of which\r\nshe had once been that little insignificant unit--was now the\r\nwell-spring whence she drew the means of satisfying her\r\never-increasing lust for splendour.\r\n\r\nJewels, dresses, palaces, gardens--all and everything that was rich,\r\nbeautiful, costly, she longed for it all!\r\n\r\nPictures and statuary; music, and of the best; constant noise around\r\nher, gaiety, festivities, laughter; the wit of France and the science\r\nof the world all had been her helpmeets these past two years in this\r\nwild chase after pleasure, this constant desire to kill her Royal\r\npatron's incurable ennui.\r\n\r\nTwo years, and already the nation grumbled! A check was to be put on\r\nher extravagance--hers and that of King Louis! The parliaments\r\ndemanded that some control be exercised over Royal munificence. Fewer\r\njewels for Madame! And that palace at Fontainebleau not yet completed,\r\nthe Parc aux Cerfs so magnificently planned and not even begun! Would\r\nthe new Comptroller put a check on that?\r\n\r\nAt first she marvelled that Louis should consent. It was a humiliation\r\nfor him as well as for her. The weakness in him which had served her\r\nown ends seemed monstrous when it yielded to pressure from others.\r\n\r\nHe had assured her that she should not suffer; jewels, palaces,\r\ngardens, she should have all as heretofore. Let Parliament insist and\r\ngrumble, but the Comptroller would be appointed by D'Aumont, and\r\nD'Aumont was her slave.\r\n\r\nD'Aumont, yes! but not his daughter--that arrogant girl with the\r\nsevere eyes, unwomanly and dictatorial, who ruled her father just as\r\nshe herself, Pompadour, ruled the King.\r\n\r\nAn enemy, that Lydie d'Aumont! Mme. la Marquise, whilst framing a\r\nwitticism at which the King smiled, frowned because in a distant\r\nalcove she spied the haughty figure of Lydie.\r\n\r\nAnd there were others! The friends of the Queen and her clique, of\r\ncourse; they were not here to-night; at least not in great numbers;\r\nstill, even the present brilliant company, though smiling and\r\nobsequious in the presence of the King, was not by any means a close\r\nphalanx of friends.\r\n\r\nM. d'Argenson, for instance--he was an avowed enemy; and Marshal de\r\nNoailles, too--oh! and there were others.\r\n\r\nOne of them, fortunately, was going away; Charles Edward Stuart,\r\naspiring King of England; he had been no friend of Pompadour. Even\r\nnow, as he stood close by, lending an obviously inattentive ear to M.\r\nle Duc d'Aumont, she could see that he still looked gloomy and out of\r\nhumour, and that whenever his eyes rested upon her and the King he\r\nfrowned with wrathful impatience.\r\n\r\n\"You are distraite, ma mie!\" said Louis, with a yawn.\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking, sire,\" she replied, smiling into his drowsy eyes.\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, I entreat, do not think!\" exclaimed the King, with\r\nmock alarm. \"Thought produces wrinkles, and your perfect mouth was\r\nonly fashioned for smiles.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I frame a suggestion?\" she queried archly.\r\n\r\n\"No, only a command.\"\r\n\r\n\"This Comptroller of Finance, your future master, Louis, and mine----\"\r\n\r\n\"Your slave,\" he interrupted lazily, \"and he values his life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not milor Eglinton?\"\r\n\r\n\"Le petit Anglais?\" and Louis's fat body was shaken with sudden\r\nimmoderate laughter. \"Par Dieu, ma mie! Of all your witty sallies this\r\none hath pleased us most.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" she asked seriously.\r\n\r\n\"Le petit Anglais!\" again laughed the King. \"I'd as soon give the\r\nappointment to your lapdog, Marquise. Fido would have as much capacity\r\nfor the post as the ornamental cypher that hangs on his mother's\r\nskirts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Milor Eglinton is very rich,\" she mused.\r\n\r\n\"Inordinately so, curse him! I could do with half his revenue and be a\r\nsatisfied man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Being a cypher he would not trouble us much; being very rich he would\r\nneed no bribe for doing as we wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"His lady mother would trouble us, ma mie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! we would find him a wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay! I entreat you do not worry your dainty head with these matters,\"\r\nsaid the King, somewhat irritably. \"The appointment rests with\r\nD'Aumont; an you desire the post for your protégé, turn your bright\r\neyes on the Duke.\"\r\n\r\nPompadour would have wished to pursue the subject, to get something of\r\na promise from Louis, to turn his inveterate weakness then and there\r\nto her own account, but Louis the Well-beloved yawned, a calamity\r\nwhich the fair lady dared not risk again. Witty and brilliant, forever\r\ngay and unfatigued, she knew that her power over the monarch would\r\nonly last whilst she could amuse him.\r\n\r\nTherefore now with swift transition she turned the conversation to\r\nmore piquant channels. An anecdote at the expense of the old Duchesse\r\nde Pontchartrain brought life once more into the eyes of the King. She\r\nwas once more untiring in her efforts, her cheeks glowed even through\r\nthe powder and the rouge, her lips smiled without intermission, but\r\nher thoughts drifted back to the root idea, the burden of that control\r\nto be imposed on her caprices.\r\n\r\nShe would not have minded Milor Eglinton, the courteous, amiable\r\ngentleman, who had no will save that expressed by any woman who\r\nhappened to catch his ear. She felt that she could, with but very\r\nlittle trouble, twist him round her little finger. His dictatorial\r\nmamma would either have to be got out of the way, or won over to Mme.\r\nla Marquise's own views of life, whilst Milor could remain a bachelor,\r\nlest another feminine influence prove antagonistic.\r\n\r\nPompadour's bright eyes, whilst she chatted to the King, sought amidst\r\nthe glittering throng the slim figure of \"le petit Anglais.\"\r\n\r\nYes, he would suit her purpose admirably! She could see his handsome\r\nprofile clearly outlined against the delicate tones of the wall;\r\nhandsome, yes! clear-cut and firm, with straight nose and the low,\r\nsquare brow of the Anglo-Saxon race, but obviously weak and yielding;\r\na perfect tool in the hands of a clever woman.\r\n\r\nElegant too, always immaculately, nay daintily dressed, he wore with\r\nthat somewhat stiff grace peculiar to the English gentleman the showy\r\nand effeminate costume of the time. But there was weakness expressed\r\nin his very attitude as he stood now talking to Charles Edward Stuart:\r\nthe kindly, pleasant expression of his good-looking face in strange\r\ncontrast to the glowering moodiness of his princely friend.\r\n\r\nOne Lord Eglinton had followed the deposed James II into exile. His\r\nson had risked life and fortune for the restoration of the old\r\nPretender, and having managed by sheer good luck to save both, he felt\r\nthat he had done more than enough for a cause which he knew was doomed\r\nto disaster. But he hated the thought of a German monarch in England,\r\nand in his turn preferred exile to serving a foreigner for whom he had\r\nscant sympathy.\r\n\r\nImmensely wealthy, a brilliant conversationalist, a perfect gentleman,\r\nhe soon won the heart of one of the daughters of France. Mlle. de\r\nMaille brought him, in addition to her own elaborate trousseau and a\r\ndowry of three thousand francs yearly pin-money, the historic and\r\ngorgeous chateau of Beaufort which Lord Eglinton's fortune rescued\r\nfrom the hands of the bailiffs.\r\n\r\nVaguely he thought that some day he would return to his own ancestral\r\nhome in Sussex, when England would have become English once again; in\r\nthe meanwhile he was content to drift on the placid waters of life,\r\nhis luxurious craft guided by the domineering hand of his wife.\r\nIndependent owing to his nationality and his wealth, a friend alike of\r\nthe King of France and the Stuart Pretender, he neither took up arms\r\nin any cause, nor sides in any political intrigue.\r\n\r\nLady Eglinton brought up her son in affluence and luxury, but detached\r\nfrom all partisanship. Her strong personality imposed something of her\r\nown national characteristics on the boy, but she could not break the\r\nfriendship that existed between the royal Stuarts and her husband's\r\nfamily. Although Charles Edward was her son's playmate in the gardens\r\nand castle of Beaufort, she nevertheless succeeded in instilling into\r\nthe latter a slight measure of disdain for the hazardous attempts at\r\nsnatching the English crown which invariably resulted in the betrayal\r\nof friends, the wholesale slaughter of adherents, and the ignominious\r\nflight of the Pretender.\r\n\r\nNo doubt it was this dual nationality in the present Lord Eglinton,\r\nthis detachment from political conflicts, that was the real cause of\r\nthat inherent weakness of character which Mme. de Pompadour now wished\r\nto use for her own ends. She was glad, therefore, to note that whilst\r\nCharles Edward talked earnestly to him, the eyes of \"le petit Anglais\"\r\nroamed restlessly about the room, as if seeking for support in an\r\nargument, or help from a personality stronger than his own.\r\n\r\nLady Eglinton's voice, harsh and domineering, often rose above the\r\ngeneral hum of talk. Just now she had succeeded in engaging the Prime\r\nMinister in serious conversation.\r\n\r\nThe King in the meanwhile had quietly dropped asleep, lulled by the\r\neven ripple of talk of the beautiful Marquise and the heavily scented\r\natmosphere of the room. Pompadour rose from her chair as noiselessly\r\nas her stiff brocaded skirt would allow; she crossed the room and\r\njoined Lady Eglinton and M. le Duc d'Aumont.\r\n\r\nShe was going to take King Louis's advice and add the weighty\r\ninfluence of her own bright eyes to that of my lady's voluble talk in\r\nfavour of the appointment of Lord Eglinton to the newly created\r\nMinistry of Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nA WOMAN'S SURRENDER\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a small alcove, which was raised above the level of the rest of the\r\nfloor by a couple of steps and divided from the main banqueting hall\r\nby a heavy damask curtain now partially drawn aside, Mlle. d'Aumont\r\nsat in close conversation with M. le Comte de Stainville.\r\n\r\nFrom this secluded spot these two dominated the entire length and\r\nbreadth of the room; the dazzling scene was displayed before them in a\r\ngorgeous kaleidoscope of moving figures, in an ever-developing\r\npanorama of vividly coloured groups, that came and went, divided and\r\nreunited; now forming soft harmonies of delicate tones that suggested\r\nthe subtle blending on the palette of a master, anon throwing on to\r\nthe canvas daring patches of rich magentas or deep purples, that set\r\noff with cunning artfulness the masses of pale primrose and gold.\r\n\r\nGaston de Stainville, however, did not seem impressed with the\r\npicturesqueness of the scene. He sat with his broad back turned toward\r\nthe brilliant company, one elbow propped on a small table beside him,\r\nhis hand shielding his face against the glare of the candles. But\r\nLydie d'Aumont's searching eyes roamed ceaselessly over the gaily\r\nplumaged birds that fluttered uninterruptedly before her gaze.\r\n\r\nWith one delicate hand holding back the rich damask curtain, the other\r\nlying idly in her lap, her white brocaded gown standing out in stiff\r\nfolds round her girlish figure, she was a picture well worth looking\r\nat.\r\n\r\nLydie was scarcely twenty-one then, but already there was a certain\r\nsomething in the poise of her head, in every movement of her graceful\r\nbody, that suggested the woman accustomed to dominate, the woman of\r\nthought and action, rather than of sentiment and tender emotions.\r\n\r\nThose of her own sex said at that time that in Lydie's haughty eyes\r\nthere was the look of the girl who has been deprived early in life of\r\na mother's gentle influence, and who has never felt the gentle yet\r\nfirm curb of a mother's authority on her childish whims and caprices.\r\n\r\nM. le Duc d'Aumont, who had lost his young wife after five years of an\r\nexceptionally happy married life, had lavished all the affection of\r\nhis mature years on the girl, who was the sole representative of his\r\nname. The child had always been headstrong and self-willed from the\r\ncradle; her nurses could not cope with her babyish tempers; her\r\ngovernesses dreaded her domineering ways. M. le Duc was deaf to all\r\ncomplaints; he would not have the child thwarted, and as she grew up\r\nlovable in the main, she found her father's subordinates ready enough\r\nto bend to her yoke.\r\n\r\nFrom the age of ten she had been the acknowledged queen of all her\r\nplaymates, and the autocrat of her father's house. Little by little\r\nshe obtained an extraordinary ascendancy over the fond parent, who\r\nadmired almost as much as he loved her.\r\n\r\nHe was deeply touched when, scarce out of the school room, she tried\r\nto help him in the composition of his letters, and more than\r\nastonished to see how quick was her intelligence and how sharp her\r\nintuition. Instinctively, at first he took to explaining to her the\r\nvarious political questions of the day, listening with paternal\r\ngood-humour, to her acute and sensitive remarks on several important\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nThen gradually his confidence in her widened. Many chroniclers aver\r\nthat it was Lydie d'Aumont who wrote her father's celebrated memoirs,\r\nand those who at that time had the privilege of knowing her intimately\r\ncould easily trace her influence in most of her father's political\r\nmoves. There is no doubt that the Duc himself, when he finally became\r\nPrime Minister of France, did very little without consulting his\r\ndaughter, and even l'Abbé d'Alivet, in his \"Chroniques de Louis XV,\"\r\nadmits that the hot partisanship of France for the Young Pretender's\r\nill-conceived expeditions was mainly due to Mlle. d'Aumont's\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nWhen Vanloo painted her a little later on, he rendered with consummate\r\nand delicate skill the haughty look of command which many of Lydie's\r\nmost ardent admirers felt to be a blemish on the exquisite purity and\r\ncharm of her face.\r\n\r\nThe artist, too, emphasized the depth and earnestness of her dark\r\neyes, and that somewhat too severe and self-reliant expression which\r\nmarked the straight young brow.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was this same masterful trait in the dainty form before him\r\nthat Gaston de Stainville studied so attentively just now; there had\r\nbeen silence for some time between the elegant cavalier and the\r\nidolized daughter of the Prime Minister of France. She seemed restless\r\nand anxious, even absent-minded, when he spoke. She was studying the\r\nvarious groups of men and women as they passed, frowning when she\r\nlooked on some faces, smiling abstractedly when she encountered a pair\r\nof friendly eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I did not know that you were such a partisan of that young\r\nadventurer,\" said Gaston de Stainville at last, as if in answer to her\r\nthoughts, noting that her gaze now rested with stern intentness on\r\nCharles Edward Stuart.\r\n\r\n\"I must be on the side of a just cause,\" she rejoined quietly, as with\r\na very characteristic movement of hers she turned her head slowly\r\nround and looked M. de Stainville full in the face.\r\n\r\nShe could not see him very well, for his head was silhouetted against\r\nthe dazzling light beyond, and she frowned a little as she tried to\r\ndistinguish his features more clearly in the shadow.\r\n\r\n\"You do believe, Gaston, that his cause is just?\" she asked earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" he replied lightly; \"I'll believe in the justice of any cause to\r\nwhich you give your support.\"\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders, whilst a slightly contemptuous curl\r\nappeared at the corner of her mouth.\r\n\r\n\"How like a man!\" she said impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"What is like a man?\" he retorted. \"To love--as I love you?\"\r\n\r\nHe had whispered this, hardly above his breath lest he should be\r\noverheard by some one in that gay and giddy throng who passed\r\nlaughingly by. The stern expression in her eyes softened a little as\r\nthey met his eager gaze, but the good-humoured contempt was still\r\napparent, even in her smile; she saw that as he spoke he looked\r\nthrough the outspread fingers of his hand to see if he was being\r\nwatched, and noted that one pair of eyes, distant the whole length of\r\nthe room, caught the movement, then was instantly averted.\r\n\r\n\"Mlle. de Saint Romans is watching you,\" she said quietly.\r\n\r\nHe seemed surprised and not a little vexed that she had noticed, and\r\nfor a moment looked confused; then he said carelessly:\r\n\r\n\"Why should she not? Why should not the whole world look on, and see\r\nthat I adore you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Meseems you protest over-much, Gaston,\" she said, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\"\r\n\r\n\"You talk of love too lightly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am in earnest, Lydie. Why should you doubt? Are you not beautiful\r\nenough to satisfy any man's ardour?\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I not influential enough, you mean,\" she said, with a slight\r\ntremor in her rich young voice, \"to satisfy any man's ambition?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is ambition a crime in your eyes, Lydie?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but----\"\r\n\r\n\"I am ambitious; you cannot condemn me for that,\" he said, now\r\nspeaking in more impressive tone. \"When we were playmates together,\r\nyears ago, you remember? in the gardens at Cluny, if other lads were\r\nthere, was I not always eager to be first in the race, first in the\r\nfield--first always, everywhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Even at the cost of sorrow and humiliation to the weaker ones.\"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders with easy unconcern.\r\n\r\n\"There is no success in life for the strong,\" he said, \"save at the\r\ncost of sorrow and humiliation for the weak. Lydie,\" he added more\r\nearnestly, \"if I am ambitious it is because my love for you has made\r\nme humble. I do not feel that as I am, I am worthy of you; I want to\r\nbe rich, to be influential, to be great. Is that wrong? I want your\r\npride in me, almost as much as your love.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were rich once, Gaston,\" she said, a little coldly. \"Your father\r\nwas rich.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it my fault if I am poor now?\"\r\n\r\n\"They tell me it is; they say that you are over-fond of cards, and of\r\nother pleasures which are less avowable.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you believe them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hardly know,\" she whispered.\r\n\r\n\"You have ceased to love me, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gaston!\"\r\n\r\nThere as a tone of tender reproach there, which the young man was\r\nswift enough to note; the beautiful face before him was in full light;\r\nhe could see well that a rosy blush had chased away the usual matt\r\npallor of her cheeks, and that the full red lips trembled a little\r\nnow, whilst the severe expression of the eyes was veiled in delicate\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\n\"Your face has betrayed you, Lydie!\" he said, with sudden vehemence,\r\nthough his voice even now hardly rose above a whisper. \"If you have\r\nnot forgotten your promises made to me at Cluny--in the shadow of\r\nthose beech trees, do you remember? You were only thirteen--a mere\r\nchild--yet already a woman, the soft breath of spring fanned your\r\nglowing cheeks, your loose hair blew about your face, framing your\r\nproud little head in a halo of gold--you remember, Lydie?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not forgotten,\" she said gently.\r\n\r\n\"Your hand was in mine--a child's hand, Lydie, but yours for all\r\nthat--and you promised--you remember? And if you have not\r\nforgotten--if you do love me, not, Heaven help me! as I love you, but\r\nonly just a little better than any one else in the world; well, then,\r\nLydie, why these bickerings, why these reproaches? I am poor now, but\r\nsoon I will be rich! I have no power, but soon I will rule France,\r\nwith you to help me if you will!\"\r\n\r\nHe had grown more and more vehement as he spoke, carried along by the\r\ntorrent of his own eloquence. But he had not moved; he still sat with\r\nhis back to the company, and his face shaded by his hand; his voice\r\nwas still low, impressive in its ardour. Then, as the young girl's\r\ngraceful head drooped beneath the passionate expression of his gaze,\r\nbending, as it were, to the intensity of his earnest will, his eyes\r\nflashed a look of triumph, a premonition of victory close at hand.\r\nLydie's strong personality was momentarily weakened by the fatigue of\r\na long and arduous evening, by the heavy atmosphere of the room; her\r\nsenses were dulled by the penetrating odours of wine and perfumes\r\nwhich fought with those of cosmetics.\r\n\r\nShe seemed to be yielding to the softer emotions, less watchful of her\r\nown dignity, less jealous of her own power. The young man felt that at\r\nthis moment he held her just as he wished; did he stretch out his hand\r\nshe would place hers in it. The recollections of her childhood had\r\nsmothered all thoughts of present conflicts and of political\r\nintrigues. Mlle. d'Aumont, the influential daughter of an all-powerful\r\nMinister, had momentarily disappeared, giving way to madcap little\r\nLydie, with short skirts and flying chestnut curls, the comrade of the\r\nhandsome boy in the old gardens at Cluny.\r\n\r\n\"Lydie, if you loved me!\" whispered Stainville.\r\n\r\n\"If I loved you!\" and there was a world of pathos in that girlish\r\n\"if.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would help me instead of reproaching.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want me to do, Gaston?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your word is law with your father,\" he said persuasively. \"He denies\r\nyou nothing. You said I was ambitious; one word from you--this new\r\nMinistry----\"\r\n\r\nHe realized his danger, bit his lip lest he had been too precipitate.\r\nLydie was headstrong, she was also very shrewd; the master-mind that\r\nguided the destinies of France through the weak indulgence of a father\r\nwas not likely to be caught in a snare like any love-sick maid. Her\r\nwoman's instinct--he knew that--was keen to detect self-interest; and\r\nif he aroused the suspicions of the wealthy and influential woman\r\nbefore he had wholly subjugated her heart, he knew that he would lose\r\nthe biggest stake of his life.\r\n\r\nLately she had held aloof from him, the playmates had become somewhat\r\nestranged; the echoes of his reckless life must, he thought, have\r\nreached her ears, and he himself had not been over-eager for the\r\ncompanionship of this woman, who seemed to have thrown off all the\r\nlight-heartedness of her sex for the sake of a life of activity and\r\ndomination.\r\n\r\nShe was known to be cold and unapproachable, rigidly conscientious in\r\ntransacting the business of the State, which her father with easy\r\ncarelessness gradually left on her young shoulders, since she seemed\r\nto find pleasure in it.\r\n\r\nBut her influence, of which she was fully conscious, had rendered her\r\nsuspicious. Even now, when the call of her youth, of her beauty, of\r\nthe happy and tender recollections of her childhood loudly demanded\r\nto be heard, she cast a swift, inquiring glance at Gaston.\r\n\r\nHe caught the glance, and, with an involuntary movement of impatience,\r\nhis hand, which up to now had so carefully masked the expression of\r\nhis face, came crashing down upon the table.\r\n\r\n\"Lydie,\" he said impetuously, \"in the name of God throw aside your\r\narmour for one moment! Is life so long that you can afford to waste\r\nit? Have you learned the secret of perpetual youth that you\r\ndeliberately fritter away its golden moments in order to rush after\r\nthe Dead Sea fruit of domination and power? Lydie!\" he whispered with\r\npassionate tenderness; \"my little Lydie of the crisp chestnut hair, of\r\nthe fragrant woods around Cluny, leave those giddy heights of\r\nambition; come down to earth, where my arms await you! I will tell you\r\nof things, my little Lydie, which are far more beautiful, far more\r\ndesirable, than the sceptre and kingdom of France; and when I press\r\nyou close to my heart you will taste a joy far sweeter than that which\r\na crown of glory can give. Will you not listen to me, Lydie? Will you\r\nnot share with me that joy which renders men the equal of God?\"\r\n\r\nHis hand had wandered up the damask curtain, gently drawing its heavy\r\nfolds from out her clinging fingers. The rich brocade fell behind him\r\nwith a soft and lingering sound like the murmured \"Hush--sh--sh!\" of\r\nangels' wings shutting out the noise and glare beyond, isolating them\r\nboth from the world and its conflicts, its passions, and its ceaseless\r\nstrife.\r\n\r\nSecure from prying eyes, Gaston de Stainville threw all reserve from\r\nhim with a laugh of pride and of joy. Half kneeling, wholly leaning\r\ntoward her, his arms encircled her young figure, almost pathetic now\r\nin its sudden and complete abandonment. With his right hand he drew\r\nthat imperious little head down until his lips had reached her ear.\r\n\r\n\"Would you have me otherwise, my beautiful proud queen?\" he whispered\r\nsoftly. \"Should I be worthy of the cleverest woman in France if my\r\nambition and hopes were not at least as great as hers? Lydie,\" he\r\nadded, looking straight into her eyes, \"if you asked me for a kingdom\r\nin the moon, I swear to God that I would make a start in order to\r\nconquer it for you! Did you, from sheer caprice, ask to see my life's\r\nblood ebbing out of my body, I would thrust this dagger without\r\nhesitation into my heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush! hush!\" she said earnestly; \"that is extravagant talk, Gaston.\r\nDo not desecrate love by such folly.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis not folly, Lydie. Give me your lips and you, too, will\r\nunderstand.\"\r\n\r\nShe closed her eyes. It was so strange to feel this great gladness in\r\nher heart, this abasement of all her being; she, who had so loved to\r\ndictate and to rule, she savoured the inexpressible delight of\r\nyielding.\r\n\r\nHe demanded a kiss and she gave it because he had asked it of her,\r\nshyly wondering in her own mind how she came to submit so easily, and\r\nwhy submission should be so sweet.\r\n\r\nUp to now she had only tasted the delights of power; now she felt that\r\nif Gaston willed she would deem it joy to obey. There was infinite\r\nhappiness, infinite peace in that kiss, the first her vestal lips had\r\never granted to any man. He was again whispering to her now with that\r\nsame eager impetuosity which had subjugated her. She was glad to\r\nlisten, for he talked much of his love, of the beautiful days at\r\nCluny, which she had feared that he had wholly forgotten.\r\n\r\nIt was sweet to think that he remembered them. During the past year or\r\ntwo when evil tongues spoke of him before her, of his recklessness,\r\nhis dissipations, his servility to the growing influence of the\r\nPompadour, she had not altogether believed, but her heart, faithful to\r\nthe child-lover, had ached and rebelled against his growing neglect.\r\n\r\nNow he was whispering explanations--not excuses, for he needed none,\r\nsince he had always loved her and only jealousies and intrigues had\r\nkept him from her side. As he protested, she still did not altogether\r\nbelieve--oh, the folly of it all! the mad, glad folly!--but he said\r\nthat with a kiss she would understand.\r\n\r\nHe was right. She did understand.\r\n\r\nAnd he talked much of his ambitions. Was it not natural? Men were so\r\ndifferent to women! He, proud of his love for her, was longing to show\r\nher his power, to rule and to command; she, half-shy of her love for\r\nhim, felt her pride in submitting to his wish, in laying down at his\r\nfeet the crown and sceptre of domination which she had wielded up to\r\nnow with so proud and secure a hand.\r\n\r\nMen were so different. That, too, she understood with the first touch\r\nof a man's kiss on her lips.\r\n\r\nShe chided herself for her mistrust of him; was it not natural that he\r\nshould wish to rule? How proud was she now that her last act of\r\nabsolute power should be the satisfaction of his desire.\r\n\r\nThat new Ministry? Well, he should have it as he wished. One word from\r\nher, and her father would grant it. Her husband must be the most\r\npowerful man in France; she would make him that, since she could: and\r\nthen pillow her head on his breast and forget that she ever had other\r\nambitions save to see him great.\r\n\r\nSmiling through her tears, she begged his forgiveness for her mistrust\r\nof him, her doubts of the true worth of his love.\r\n\r\n\"It was because I knew so little,\" she said shyly as her trembling\r\nfingers toyed nervously with the lace of his cravat; \"no man has ever\r\nloved me, Gaston--you understand? There were flatterers round me and\r\nsycophants--but love----\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head with a kind of joyous sadness for the past. It was\r\nso much better to be totally ignorant of love, and then to learn\r\nit--like this!\r\n\r\nThen she became grave again.\r\n\r\n\"My father shall arrange everything this evening,\" she said, with a\r\nproud toss of her head. \"To-morrow you may command, but to-night you\r\nshall remain a suppliant; grant me, I pray you, this fond little\r\ngratification of my overburdened vanity. Ask me again to grant your\r\nrequest, to be the means of satisfying your ambition. Put it into\r\nwords, Gaston, tell me what it is you want!\" she insisted, with a\r\npretty touch of obstinacy; \"it is my whim, and remember I am still the\r\narbiter of your fate.\"\r\n\r\n\"On my knees, my queen,\" he said, curbing his impatience at her\r\nchildish caprice; and, striving to hide the note of triumph in his\r\nvoice, he put both knees to the ground and bent his head in\r\nsupplication. \"I crave of your bountiful graciousness to accord me the\r\npower to rule France by virtue of my office as Chief Comptroller of\r\nher revenues.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your desire is granted, sir,\" she said with a final assumption of\r\npride; \"the last favour I shall have the power to bestow I now confer\r\non you. To-morrow I abdicate,\" she continued, with a strange little\r\nsigh, half-tearful, half-joyous, \"to-morrow I shall own a master. M.\r\nle Comte de Stainville, Minister of the Exchequer of France, behold\r\nyour slave, Lydie, bought this night with the priceless currency of\r\nyour love! Oh, Gaston, my lord, my husband!\" she said, with a sudden\r\nuncontrollable outburst of tears, \"be a kind master to your slave--she\r\ngives up so much for your dear sake!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST TRICK\r\n\r\n\r\nA shrill laugh suddenly broke on their ears. So absorbed had Lydie\r\nbeen in her dream that she had completely forgotten the other world,\r\nthe one that laughed and talked, that fought and bickered on the other\r\nside of the damask curtain which was the boundary of her own universe.\r\n\r\nGaston de Stainville, we may assume, was not quite so unprepared for\r\ninterruption as the young girl, for even before the shrill laugh had\r\nexpended itself, he was already on his feet, and had drawn the damask\r\ncurtain back again, interposing the while his broad figure between\r\nLydie d'Aumont and the unwelcome intruder on their privacy.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! at last you are tracked to earth, _mauvais sujet_,\" said Mme. de\r\nPompadour, as soon as the Comte de Stainville stood fully revealed\r\nbefore her. \"Faith! I have had a severe task. His Majesty demanded\r\nyour presence a while ago, sir, and hath gone to sleep in the interval\r\nof waiting. Nay! nay! you need make neither haste nor excuses. The\r\nKing sleeps, Monsieur, else I were not here to remind you of duty.\"\r\n\r\nShe stood at the bottom of the steps looking up with keen, malicious\r\neyes at Gaston's figure framed in the opening of the alcove, and\r\npeering inquisitively into the sombre recesses, wherein already she\r\nhad caught a glimpse of a white satin skirt and the scintillation of\r\nmany diamonds.\r\n\r\n\"What say you, milady?\" she added, turning to the florid, somewhat\r\nover-dressed woman who stood by her side. \"Shall we listen to the\r\nexcuses M. de Stainville seems anxious to make; meseems they are clad\r\nin white satin and show a remarkably well-turned ankle.\"\r\n\r\nBut before Lady Eglinton could frame a reply, Lydie d'Aumont had\r\nrisen, and placing her hand on Stainville's shoulder, she thrust him\r\ngently aside and now stood smiling beside him, perfectly\r\nself-possessed, a trifle haughty, looking down on Jeanne de\r\nPompadour's pert face and on the older lady's obviously ill-humoured\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, Mme. la Marquise,\" she said, in her own quiet way, \"M. le Comte\r\nde Stainville's only excuse for his neglect of courtly duties stands\r\nbefore you now.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Ma foi_, Mademoiselle!\" retorted the Marquise somewhat testily. \"His\r\nMajesty, being over-gallant, would perhaps be ready enough to accept\r\nit, and so, no doubt, would the guests of M. le Duc, your\r\nfather--always excepting Mlle, de St. Romans,\" she added, with more\r\nthan a point of malice, \"and she is not like to prove indulgent.\"\r\n\r\nBut Lydie was far too proud, far too conscious also of her own worth,\r\nto heed the petty pinpricks which the ladies of the Court of Louis XV\r\nwere wont to deal so lavishly to one another. She knew quite well that\r\nGaston's name had oft been coupled with that of Mlle. de St.\r\nRomans--\"_la belle brune de Bordeaux_,\" as she was universally\r\ncalled--daughter of the gallant Maréchal just home from Flanders. This\r\ngossip was part and parcel of that multifarious scandal to which she\r\nhad just assured her lover that she no longer would lend an ear.\r\n\r\nTherefore she met Mme. de Pompadour's malicious look with one of\r\ncomplete indifference, and ignoring the remark altogether, she said\r\ncalmly, without the slightest tremor in her voice or hint of annoyance\r\nin her face:\r\n\r\n\"Did I understand you to say, Madame, that His Majesty was tired and\r\ndesired to leave?\"\r\n\r\nThe Marquise looked vexed, conscious of the snub; she threw a quick\r\nlook of intelligence to Lady Eglinton, which Lydie no doubt would have\r\ncaught had she not at that moment turned to her lover in order to give\r\nhim a smile of assurance and trust.\r\n\r\nHe, however, seemed self-absorbed just now, equally intent in avoiding\r\nher loving glance and Mme. de Pompadour's mocking gaze.\r\n\r\n\"The King certainly asked for M. de Stainville a while ago,\" here\r\ninterposed Lady Eglinton, \"and M. le Chevalier de Saint George has\r\nbegun to make his adieux.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll not detain Mlle. d'Aumont, then,\" said Mme. de Pompadour. \"She\r\nwill wish to bid our young Pretender an encouraging farewell! Come, M.\r\nde Stainville,\" she added authoritatively, \"we'll to His Majesty, but\r\nonly for two short minutes, then you shall be released man, have no\r\nfear, in order to make your peace with _la belle brune de Bordeaux_.\r\nBrrr! I vow I am quite frightened; the minx's black eyes anon shot\r\ndaggers in this direction.\"\r\n\r\nShe beckoned imperiously to Gaston, who still seemed ill at ease, and\r\nready enough to follow her. Lydie could not help noting with a slight\r\ntightening of her heartstrings with what alacrity he obeyed.\r\n\r\n\"Men are so different!\" she sighed.\r\n\r\nShe would have allowed the whole world to look on and to sneer whilst\r\nshe spent the rest of the evening beside her lover, talking foolish\r\nnonsense, planning out the future, or sitting in happy silence,\r\nheedless of sarcasm, mockery, or jests.\r\n\r\nHer eyes followed him somewhat wistfully as he descended the two steps\r\nwith easy grace, and with a flourishing bow and a \"_Mille grâces_,\r\nMlle. Lydie!\" he turned away without another backward look, and became\r\nmerged with the crowd.\r\n\r\nHer master and future lord, the man whose lips had touched her own!\r\nHow strange!\r\n\r\nShe herself could not thus have become one of the throng. Not just\r\nyet. She could not have detached herself from him so readily. For some\r\nfew seconds--minutes perhaps--her earnest eyes tried to distinguish\r\nthe pale mauve of his coat in the midst of that ever-changing\r\nkaleidoscope of dazzling colours. But the search made her eyes burn,\r\nand she closed them with the pain.\r\n\r\nMen were so different!\r\n\r\nAnd though she had learned much, understood much, with that first\r\nkiss, she was still very ignorant, very inexperienced, and quite at\r\nsea in those tortuous paths wherein Gaston and Mme. de Pompadour and\r\nall the others moved with such perfect ease.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, M. de Stainville and the Marquise had reached the\r\ncorridor. From where they now stood they could no longer see the\r\nalcove whence Lydie's aching eyes still searched for them in vain;\r\nwith a merry little laugh Madame drew her dainty hand away from her\r\ncavalier's arm.\r\n\r\n\"There! am I not the beneficent fairy, you rogue?\" she said, giving\r\nhim a playful tap with her fan. \"Fie! Will you drive in double\r\nharness? You'll come to grief, fair sir, and meseems 'twere not good\r\nto trifle with either filly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame, I entreat!\" he protested feebly, wearied of the jest. But he\r\ntried not to scowl or to seem impatient, for he was loth to lose the\r\ngood graces of a lady whose power and influence were unequalled even\r\nby Lydie d'Aumont.\r\n\r\nPompadour had favoured him from the very day of her first entry in the\r\nbrilliant Court of Versailles. His handsome face, his elegant manners,\r\nand, above all, his reputation as a consummate _mauvais sujet_ had\r\npleased Mme. la Marquise. Gaston de Stainville was never so occupied\r\nwith pleasures or amours, but he was ready to pay homage to one more\r\nbeautiful woman who was willing to smile upon him.\r\n\r\nBut though she flirted with Gaston, the wily Marquise had no wish to\r\nsee him at the head of affairs, the State-appointed controller of her\r\ncaprices and of the King's munificence. He was pleasant enough as an\r\nadmirer, unscrupulous and daring; but as a master? No.\r\n\r\nThe thought of a marriage between Mlle. d'Aumont and M. de Stainville,\r\nwith its obvious consequences on her own future plans, was not to be\r\ntolerated for a moment; and Madame wondered greatly how far matters\r\nhad gone between these two, prior to her own timely interference.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" she said, pointing to an arched doorway close at hand; \"go\r\nand make your peace whilst I endeavour to divert His Majesty's\r\nthoughts from your own wicked person; and remember,\" she added\r\ncoquettishly as she bobbed him a short, mocking curtsey, \"when you\r\nhave reached the blissful stage of complete reconciliation, that you\r\nowe your happiness to Jeanne de Pompadour.\"\r\n\r\nEtiquette demanded that he should kiss the hand which she now held\r\nextended toward him; this he did with as good a grace as he could\r\nmuster. In his heart of hearts he was wishing the interfering lady\r\nback in the victualler's shop of Paris; he was not at all prepared at\r\nthis moment to encounter the jealous wrath of \"la Belle _brune de\r\nBordeaux_.\"\r\n\r\nVaguely he thought of flight, but Mme. de Pompadour would not let him\r\noff quite so easily. With her own jewelled hand she pushed aside the\r\ncurtain which masked the doorway, and with a nod of her dainty head\r\nshe hinted to Gaston to walk into the boudoir.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for it but to obey.\r\n\r\n\"Mlle. de Saint Romans,\" said the Marquise, peeping into the room in\r\norder to reassure herself that the lady was there and alone, \"see, I\r\nbring the truant back to you. Do not be too severe on him; his\r\nindiscretion has been slight, and he will soon forget all about it, if\r\nyou will allow him to make full confession and to do penance at your\r\nfeet.\"\r\n\r\nThen she dropped the curtain behind Gaston de Stainville, and, as an\r\nadditional precaution, lest those two in there should be interrupted\r\ntoo soon, she closed the heavy folding doors which further divided the\r\nboudoir from the corridor.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if milady plays her cards cleverly,\" she murmured, \"she and I\r\nwill have done a useful evening's work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nA FALSE POSITION\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Gaston!\"\r\n\r\nM. de Stainville shook off his moodiness. The vision of la belle Irène\r\nstanding there in the satin-hung boudoir, the soft glow of well-shaded\r\ncandles shedding an elusive, rosy light on the exquisite figure, with\r\nhead thrown back and arms stretched out in a gesture of passionate\r\nappeal, was too captivating to permit of any other thought having sway\r\nover his brain, for the next second or two at any rate.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you had completely forgotten me to-night,\" she said as he\r\ncame rapidly toward her, \"and that I should not even get speech of\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nShe took his hand and led him gently to a low divan; forcing him to\r\nsit down beside her, she studied his face intently for a moment or\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\n\"Was it necessary?\" she asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"You know it was, Irène,\" he said, divining her thoughts, plunging\r\nreadily enough now into the discussion which he knew was inevitable.\r\nHis whole nature rebelled against this situation; he felt a distinct\r\nlowering of his manly pride; his masterful spirit chafed at the\r\nthought of an explanation which Irène claimed the right to demand.\r\n\r\n\"I told you, Irène,\" he continued impatiently, \"that I would speak to\r\nMlle. d'Aumont to-night, and if possible obtain a definite promise\r\nfrom her.\"\r\n\r\n\"And have you obtained that definite promise?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lydie d'Aumont promised you that you should be the new\r\nState-appointed Minister of Finance?\" she insisted.\r\n\r\n\"Yes! I have her word.\"\r\n\r\n\"And--what was the cost?\"\r\n\r\n\"The cost?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the cost,\" she said, with what was obviously enforced calm.\r\n\"Lydie d'Aumont did not give you that promise for nothing; you gave\r\nher or promised her something in return. What was it?\"\r\n\r\nHer lips were trembling, and she had some difficulty in preventing her\r\nnervous fingers from breaking into pieces the delicate mother-of-pearl\r\nfan which they held. But she was determined to appear perfectly calm,\r\nand that he should in no way suspect her of working up to a vulgar\r\nscene of jealousy.\r\n\r\n\"You are foolish, Irène!\" he said, with his characteristic nonchalant\r\nshrug of the shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Foolish?\" she repeated, still keeping her temper well under control,\r\nthough it was her voice which was shaking now. \"Foolish? Ma foi! when\r\nmy husband obtains----\"\r\n\r\n\"'Sh! 'sh! 'sh!\" he said quickly, as with rough gesture he grasped her\r\nwrist, and gave it a warning pressure.\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" she retorted; \"no one can hear.\"\r\n\r\n\"The walls have ears!\"\r\n\r\n\"And if they have? I cannot keep up this deception for ever, Gaston.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Twere worse than foolish to founder within sight of port.\"\r\n\r\n\"You trust Lydie d'Aumont's word then?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you will do nothing to spoil the situation!\" he retorted grimly.\r\n\"Another word such as you said just now, too long a prolongation of\r\nthis charming _tête-à-tête_, and Mlle. d'Aumont will make a fresh\r\npromise to some one else.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was right, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right in what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mlle. d'Aumont promised you the appointment because you made love to\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\n\"Irène!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you tell me?\" she said with passionate vehemence. \"Can't\r\nyou see that I have been torturing myself with jealous fears? I am\r\njealous--can I help it? I suffered martyrdom when I saw you there with\r\nher! I could not hear your words, but I could see the earnestness of\r\nyour attitude. Do I not know every line of your figure, every gesture\r\nof your hand? Then the curtain fell at your touch, and I could no\r\nlonger see--only divine--only tremble and fear. Mon Dieu! did I not\r\nlove you as I do, were my love merely foolish passion, would I not\r\nthen have screamed out the truth to all that jabbering crowd that\r\nstood between me and you, seeming to mock me with its prattle, and its\r\nirresponsible laughter? I am unnerved, Gaston,\" she added, with a\r\nsudden breakdown of her self-control, her voice trembling with sobs,\r\nthe tears welling to her eyes, and her hands beating against one\r\nanother with a movement of petulant nervosity. \"I could bear it, you\r\nknow, but for this secrecy, this false position; it is humiliating to\r\nme, and--Oh, be kind to me--be kind to me!\" she sobbed, giving finally\r\nway to a fit of weeping. \"I have spent such a miserable evening, all\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\nStainville's expressive lips curled into a smile. \"Be kind to\r\nme!\"--the same pathetic prayer spoken to him by Lydie a very short\r\nwhile ago. Bah! how little women understood ambition! Even Lydie! Even\r\nIrène!\r\n\r\nAnd these two women were nothing to him. Lydie herself was only a\r\nstepping-stone; the statuesque and headstrong girl made no appeal to\r\nthe essentially masculine side of his nature, and he had little love\r\nleft now for the beautiful passionate woman beside him, whom in a\r\nmoment of unreasoning impulse he had bound irrevocably to him.\r\n\r\nGaston de Stainville aspired to military honours a couple of years\r\nago; the Maréchal de Saint Romans, friend and mentor of the Dauphin,\r\nconfidant of the Queen, seemed all-powerful then. Unable to win the\r\nfather's consent to his union with Irène--for the Maréchal had more\r\nambitious views for his only daughter and looked with ill-favour on\r\nthe young gallant who had little to offer but his own handsome person,\r\nan ancient name, and a passionate desire for advancement--Gaston, who\r\nhad succeeded in enchaining the young girl's affections, had no\r\ndifficulty in persuading her to agree to a secret marriage.\r\n\r\nBut the wheel of fate proved as erratic in its movements as the\r\nflights of Stainville's ambition. With the appearance of Jeanne\r\nPoisson d'Étioles at the Court of Versailles, the Queen's gentle\r\ninfluence over Louis XV waned, and her friends fell into disfavour and\r\nobscurity. The Maréchal de Saint Romans was given an unimportant\r\ncommand in Flanders; there was nothing to be gained for the moment\r\nfrom an open alliance with his daughter. Gaston de Stainville, an\r\navowed opportunist, paid his court to the newly risen star and was\r\nreceived with smiles, but he could not shake himself from the\r\nmatrimonial fetters which he himself had forged.\r\n\r\nThe rapid rise of the Duc d'Aumont to power and the overwhelming\r\nascendancy of Lydie in the affairs of State had made the young man\r\nchafe bitterly against the indestructible barrier which he himself had\r\nerected between his desires and their fulfilment. His passion for\r\nIrène did not yield to the early love of his childhood's days; it was\r\ndrowned in the newly risen flood of more boundless ambition. It was\r\nmerely the casting aside of one stepping-stone for another more firm\r\nand more prominent.\r\n\r\nJust now in the secluded alcove, when the proud, reserved girl had\r\nlaid bare before him the secrets of her virginal soul, when with\r\npathetic abandonment she laid the sceptre of her influence and power\r\nat his feet, he had felt neither compunction nor remorse; now, when\r\nthe woman who had trusted and blindly obeyed him asked for his help\r\nand support in a moral crisis, he was conscious only of a sense of\r\nirritation and even of contempt, which he tried vainly to disguise.\r\n\r\nAt the same time he knew well that it is never wise to tax a woman's\r\nsubmission too heavily. Irène had yielded to his wish that their\r\nmarriage be kept a secret for the present only because she, too, was\r\ntainted with a touch of that unscrupulous ambition which was the chief\r\ncharacteristic of the epoch. She was shrewd enough to know that her\r\nhusband would have but little chance in elbowing his way up the ladder\r\nof power--\"each rung of which was wrapped in a petticoat,\" as M. de\r\nVoltaire had pertinently put it--if he was known to be dragging a wife\r\nat his heels; Gaston had had no difficulty in making her understand\r\nthat his personality as a gay and irresponsible butterfly, as a man\r\nof fashion, and a squire of dames, was the most important factor in\r\nthe coming fight for the virtual dominion of France.\r\n\r\nShe had accepted the position at first with an easy grace; she knew\r\nher Gaston, and knew that he must not be handled with too tight a\r\ncurb; moreover, her secret status pleased her, whilst he remained\r\navowedly faithful to her she liked to see him court and smile, a\r\n_preux chevalier_ with the ladies; she relished the thought of being\r\nthe jailer to that gaily-plumaged bird, whom bright eyes and smiling\r\nlips tried to entice and enchain.\r\n\r\nBut to-night a crisis had come; something in Gaston's attitude toward\r\nLydie had irritated her beyond what she was prepared to endure. His\r\nlove for her had begun to wane long ago; she knew that, but she was\r\nnot inclined to see it bestowed on another. Stainville feared that she\r\nwas losing self-control, and that she might betray all and lose all if\r\nhe did not succeed in laying her jealous wrath to rest. He was past\r\nmaster in the art of dealing with a woman's tears.\r\n\r\n\"Irène,\" he said earnestly, \"I have far too much respect for you to\r\nlook upon this childish outburst of tears as representing the true\r\nstate of your feelings. You are unnerved--you own it yourself. Will\r\nyou allow me to hold your hand?\" he said with abrupt transition.\r\n\r\nThen as she yielded her trembling hand to him he pressed a lingering\r\nkiss in the icy cold palm.\r\n\r\n\"Will you not accept with this kiss the assurance of my unswerving\r\nfaith and loyalty?\" he said, speaking in that low, deep-toned voice of\r\nhis which he knew so well how to make tender and appealing to the\r\nheart of women. \"Irène, if I have committed an indiscretion to-night,\r\nif I allowed my ambition to soar beyond the bounds of prudence, will\r\nyou not believe that with my ambition my thoughts flew up to you and\r\nonly came down to earth in order to rest at your feet?\"\r\n\r\nHe had drawn her close to him, ready to whisper in her ear, as he had\r\nwhispered half an hour ago in those of Lydie. He wanted this woman's\r\ntrust and confidence just a very little while longer, and he found\r\nwords readily enough with which to hoodwink and to cajole. Irène was\r\nan easier prey than Lydie. She was his wife and her ambitions were\r\nbound up with his; her mistrust only came from jealousy, and jealousy\r\nin a woman is so easily conquered momentarily, if she be beautiful and\r\nyoung and the man ardent and unscrupulous.\r\n\r\nGaston as yet had no difficult task; but every day would increase\r\nthose difficulties, until he had finally grasped the aim of his\r\nambitious desires and had rid himself of Lydie.\r\n\r\n\"Irène!\" he whispered now, for he felt that she was consoled, and\r\nbeing consoled, she was ready to yield. \"Irène, my wife, a little more\r\npatience, a little more trust. Two days--a week--what matter? Shut\r\nyour eyes to all save this one moment to-night, when your husband is\r\nat your feet and when his soul goes out to yours in one long, and\r\ntender kiss. Your lips, ma mie!\"\r\n\r\nShe bent her head to him. Womanlike, she could not resist. Memory came\r\nto his aid as he pleaded, the memory of those early days on the\r\nvine-clad hills near Bordeaux, when he had wooed and won her with the\r\nsavour of his kiss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG PRETENDER\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Lydie d'Aumont's eyes had watched his disappearing figure through\r\nthe crowd, until she could bear the sight no longer, and closed them\r\nwith the pain.\r\n\r\nAn even, pleasant, very courteous voice roused her from her reverie.\r\n\r\n\"You are tired, Mlle. d'Aumont. May I--that is, I should be very proud\r\nif you would allow me to--er----\"\r\n\r\nShe opened her eyes and saw the handsome face of \"le petit Anglais\"\r\nturned up to her with a look of humility, a deprecatory offer of\r\nservice, and withal a strange mingling of compassion which somehow at\r\nthis moment, in her sensitive and nervous state, seemed to wound and\r\nsting her.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not the least tired,\" she said coldly; \"I thank you, milor. The\r\ncolours and the light were so dazzling for the moment, my eyes closed\r\ninvoluntarily.\"\r\n\r\n\"I humbly beg your pardon,\" said Eglinton with nervous haste; \"I\r\nthought that perhaps a glass of wine----\"\r\n\r\n\"Tush child!\" interposed Lady Eglinton in her harsh dry voice; \"have\r\nyou not heard that Mlle. d'Aumont is not fatigued. Offer her the\r\nsupport of your arm and take her to see the Chevalier de Saint George,\r\nwho is waiting to bid her 'good-bye.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay! I assure you I can walk alone,\" rejoined Lydie, taking no heed\r\nto the proffered arm which Lord Eglinton, in obedience to his mother's\r\nsuggestion, was holding out toward her. \"Where is His Majesty the King\r\nof England?\" emphasizing the title with marked reproof, and looking\r\nwith somewhat good-natured contempt at the young Englishman who, with\r\na crestfallen air, had already dropped the arm which she had disdained\r\nand stepped quickly out of her way, whilst a sudden blush spread over\r\nhis good-looking face.\r\n\r\nHe looked so confused and sheepish, so like a chidden child, that she\r\nwas instantly seized with remorse, as if she had teased a defenseless\r\nanimal, and though the touch of contempt was still apparent in her\r\nattitude, she said more kindly:\r\n\r\n\"I pray you forgive me, milor. I am loth to think that perhaps our\r\ngallant Chevalier will never bear his rightful title in his own\r\ncountry. I feel that it cheers him to hear us--who are in true\r\nsympathy with him--calling him by that name. Shall we go find the King\r\nof England and wish him 'God-speed'?\"\r\n\r\nShe beckoned to Lord Eglinton, but he had probably not yet\r\nsufficiently recovered from the snub administered to him to realize\r\nthat the encouraging glance was intended for him, and he hung back,\r\nnot daring to follow, instinctively appealing to his mother for\r\nguidance as to what he should do.\r\n\r\n\"He is modest,\" said Lady Eglinton, with the air of a proud mother\r\nlauding her young offspring. \"A heart of gold, my dear Mlle.\r\nd'Aumont!\" she whispered behind her fan, \"under a simple exterior.\"\r\n\r\nLydie shrugged her shoulders with impatience. She knew whither Lady\r\nEglinton's praises of her son would drift presently. The pompous lady\r\nlooked for all the world like a fussy hen, her stiff brocaded gown and\r\nvoluminous paniers standing out in stiff folds each side of her portly\r\nfigure like a pair of wings, and to Lydie d'Aumont's proud spirit it\r\nseemed more than humiliating for a man, rich, young, apparently in\r\nperfect health, to allow himself to be domineered over by so vapid a\r\npersonality as was milady Eglinton.\r\n\r\nInstinctively her thoughts flew back to Gaston; very different\r\nphysically to \"le petit Anglais;\" undoubtedly not so attractive from\r\nthe point of view of manly grace and bearing, but a man for all that!\r\nwith a man's weaknesses and failings, and just that spice of devilry\r\nand uncertainty in him which was pleasing to a woman.\r\n\r\n\"So unreliable, my dear Mlle. d'Aumont,\" came in insinuating accents\r\nfrom Lady Eglinton. \"Look at his lengthy entanglement with Mlle. de\r\nSaint Romans.\"\r\n\r\nLydie gave a start sudden; had she spoken her thoughts out loudly\r\nwhilst her own mind was buried in happy retrospect? She must have been\r\ndreaming momentarily certainly, and must have been strangely\r\nabsent-minded, for she was quite unconscious of having descended the\r\nalcove steps until she found herself walking between Lord Eglinton and\r\nhis odious mother, in the direction of the corridors, whilst milady\r\nwent prattling on with irritating monotony:\r\n\r\n\"You would find such support in my son. The Chevalier de Saint\r\nGeorge--er--I mean the King of England--trusts him absolutely, you\r\nunderstand--they have been friends since boyhood. Harry would do more\r\nfor him if he could, but he has not the power. Now as Comptroller of\r\nFinance--you understand? You have such sympathy with the Stuart\r\npretensions, Mademoiselle, and a union of sympathies would do much\r\ntowards furthering the success of so just a cause; and if my son--you\r\nunderstand----\"\r\n\r\nLydie's ears were buzzing with the incessant chatter. Had she not been\r\nso absorbed in her thoughts she would have laughed at the absurdity of\r\nthe whole thing. This insignificant nonentity beside her, with the\r\nstrength and character of a chicken, pushed into a place of influence\r\nand power by that hen-like mother, and she--Lydie--lending a hand to\r\nthis installation of a backboneless weakling to the highest position\r\nof France!\r\n\r\nThe situation would have been supremely ridiculous were it not for the\r\nelement of pathos in it--the pathos of a young life which might have\r\nbeen so brilliant, so full of activity and interest, now tied to the\r\napron-strings of an interfering mother.\r\n\r\nLydie herself, though accustomed to rule in one of the widest spheres\r\nthat ever fell to woman's lot, wielded her sceptre with discretion and\r\ntact. In these days when the King was ruled by Pompadour, when Mme. du\r\nChâtelet swayed the mind of Voltaire, and Marie Thérèse subjugated the\r\nHungarians, there was nothing of the blatant petticoat government in\r\nLydie's influence over her father. The obtrusive domination of a woman\r\nlike milady was obnoxious and abhorrent to her mind, proud of its\r\nfeminity, gentle in the consciousness of its strength.\r\n\r\nNow she feared that, forgetful of courtly manners, she might say or do\r\nsomething which would offend the redoubtable lady. There was still the\r\nwhole length of the banqueting-hall to traverse, also the corridor,\r\nbefore she could hope to be released from so unwelcome a\r\ncompanionship.\r\n\r\nApparently unconscious of having roused Lydie's disapproval, milady\r\ncontinued to prattle. Her subject of conversation was still her son,\r\nand noting that his attention seemed to be wandering, she called to\r\nhim in her imperious voice:\r\n\r\n\"Harry! Harry!\" she said impatiently. \"Am I to to be your spokesman\r\nfrom first to last? Ah!\" she added, with a sigh, \"men are not what\r\nthey were when I was wooed and won. What say you, my dear Mlle. Lydie?\r\nThe age of chivalry, of doughty deeds and bold adventures, is indeed\r\npast and gone, else a young man of Lord Eglinton's advantages would\r\nnot depute his own mother to do his courting for him.\"\r\n\r\nA shriek of laughter which threatened to be hysterical rose to Lydie's\r\nthroat. How gladly would she have beaten a precipitate retreat.\r\nUnfortunately the room was crowded with people, who unconsciously\r\nimpeded progress. She turned and looked at \"le petit Anglais,\" the\r\nsorry hero of this prosaic wooing, wondering what was his _rôle_ in\r\nthis silly, childish intrigue. She met his gentle eyes fixed upon hers\r\nwith a look which somehow reminded her of a St. Bernard dog that she\r\nhad once possessed; there was such a fund of self-deprecation, such\r\nabject apology in the look, that she felt quite unaccountably sorry\r\nfor him, and the laughter died before it reached her lips.\r\n\r\nSomething prompted her to try and reassure him; the same feeling would\r\nhave caused her to pat the head of her dog.\r\n\r\n\"I feel sure,\" she said kindly, \"that Lord Eglinton will have no need\r\nof a proxy once he sets his mind on serious wooing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this is serious!\" retorted Lady Eglinton testily. Lydie shook her\r\nhead:\r\n\r\n\"As little serious as his lordship's desire to control the finances of\r\nFrance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! but who better fitted for the post than my son. He is so\r\nrich--the richest man in France, and in these days of bribery and\r\ncorruption--you understand, and--and being partly English--not wholly,\r\nI am thankful to say--for I abominate the English myself; but we must\r\nown that they are very shrewd where money is concerned--and----\"\r\n\r\n\"In the name of Heaven, milady,\" said Lydie irritably, \"will you not\r\nallow your son to know his own mind? If he has a request to place\r\nbefore M. le Duc my father or before me, let him do so for himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think--er--perhaps Mlle. d'Aumont is right,\" here interposed Lord\r\nEglinton gently. \"You will--er--I hope, excuse my mother,\r\nMademoiselle; she is so used to my consulting her in everything that\r\nperhaps---- You see,\" he continued in his nervous halting, way, \"I--I\r\nam rather stupid and I am very lazy; she thinks I should understand\r\nfinance, because I--but I don't believe I should; I----\"\r\n\r\nHer earnest eyes, fixed with good-humoured indulgence upon his anxious\r\nface, seemed to upset him altogether. His throat was dry, and his\r\ntongue felt as if it were several sizes too large for his parched\r\nmouth. For the moment it looked as if the small modicum of courage\r\nwhich he possessed would completely give out, but noting that just for\r\nthe moment his mother was engaged in exchanging hasty greetings with\r\na friend, he seemed to make a violent and sudden effort, and with the\r\naudacity which sometimes assails the preternaturally weak, he plunged\r\nwildly into his subject.\r\n\r\n\"I have no desire for positions which I am too stupid to fill,\" he\r\nsaid, speaking so rapidly that Lydie could hardly follow him; \"but,\r\nMademoiselle, I entreat you do not believe that my admiration for you\r\nis not serious. I know I am quite unworthy to be even your lacquey,\r\nthough I wouldn't mind being that, since it would bring me sometimes\r\nnear you. Please, please, don't look at me--I am such a clumsy fool,\r\nand I daresay I am putting things all wrong! My mother says,\" he\r\nadded, with a pathetic little sigh, \"that I shall spoil everything if\r\nI open my mouth, and now I have done it, and you are angry, and I wish\r\nto God somebody would come and give me a kick!\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, flushed, panting and excited, having come to the end of his\r\ncourage, whilst Lydie did not know if she should be angry or sorry. A\r\nsmile hovered round her lips, yet she would gladly have seen some\r\nmanlike creature administer chastisement to this foolish weakling. Her\r\nkeenly analytical mind flew at once to comparisons.\r\n\r\nGaston de Stainville--and now this poor specimen of manhood! She had\r\ntwice been wooed in this self-same room within half an hour; but how\r\ndifferent had been the methods of courting. A look of indulgence for\r\nthe weak, a flash of pride for the strong, quickly lit up her\r\nstatuesque face. It was the strong who had won, though womanlike, she\r\nfelt a kindly pity for him who did not even dare to ask for that which\r\nthe other had so boldly claimed as his right--her love.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the _tête-à-tête_, which was rapidly becoming\r\nembarrassing--for she really did not know how to reply to this strange\r\nand halting profession of love--was at last drawing to a close. At the\r\nend of the corridor Charles Edward Stuart, surrounded by a group of\r\nfriends, had caught sight of her, and with gracious courtesy he\r\nadvanced to meet her.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! the gods do indeed favour us,\" he said gallantly in answer to her\r\nrespectful salute, and nodding casually to Lady Eglinton, who had\r\nbobbed him a grudging curtsey, \"We feared that our enemy, Time,\r\ntreading hard on our heels, would force us to depart ere we had\r\ngreeted our Muse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty is leaving us?\" she asked. \"So soon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! the hour is late. We start to-morrow at daybreak.\"\r\n\r\n\"God speed you, Sire!\" she said fervently.\r\n\r\n\"To my death,\" he rejoined gloomily.\r\n\r\n\"To victory, Sire, and your Majesty's own kingdom!\" she retorted\r\ncheerily. \"Nay! I, your humble, yet most faithful adherent, refuse to\r\nbe cast down to-night. See,\" she added, pointing to the group of\r\ngentlemen who had remained discreetly in the distance, \"you have brave\r\nhearts to cheer you, brave swords to help you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Would I were sure of a brave ship to rescue me and them if I fail!\"\r\nhe murmured.\r\n\r\nShe tossed her head with a characteristic movement of impatience.\r\n\r\n\"Nay! I was determined not to speak of failure to-night, Sire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet must I think of it,\" he rejoined, \"since the lives of my friends\r\nare dependent on me.\"\r\n\r\n\"They give their lives gladly for your cause.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would prefer to think that a good ship from France was ready to\r\ntake them aboard if evil luck force us to flee.\"\r\n\r\n\"France has promised you that ship, Monseigneur,\" she said earnestly:\r\n\r\n\"If France meant you, Mademoiselle,\" he said firmly, \"I would believe\r\nin her.\"\r\n\r\n\"She almost means Lydie d'Aumont!\" retorted the young girl, with\r\nconscious pride.\r\n\r\n\"Only for a moment,\" broke in Lady Eglinton spitefully; \"but girls\r\nmarry,\" she added, \"and every husband may not be willing to be held\r\nunder the sway of satin petticoats.\"\r\n\r\n\"If France fails you, Monseigneur,\" here interposed a gentle voice, \"I\r\nhave already had the honour of assuring you that there is enough\r\nEglinton money still in the country to fit out a ship for your safety;\r\nand--er----\"\r\n\r\nThen, as if ashamed of this outburst, the second of which he had been\r\nguilty to-night, \"le petit Anglais\" once more relapsed into silence.\r\nBut Lydie threw him a look of encouragement.\r\n\r\n\"Well spoken, milor!\" she said approvingly.\r\n\r\nWith her quick intuition she had already perceived that milady was\r\ndispleased, and she took a malicious pleasure in dragging Lord\r\nEglinton further into the conversation. She knew quite well that\r\nmilady cared naught about the Stuarts or their fate. From the day of\r\nher marriage she had dissociated herself from the cause, for the\r\nfurtherance of which her husband's father had given up home and\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIt was her influence which had detached the late Lord Eglinton from\r\nthe fortunes of the two Pretenders; justly, perhaps, since the\r\nexpeditions were foredoomed to failure, and Protestant England rightly\r\nor wrongly mistrusted all the Stuarts. But Lydie's romantic instincts\r\ncould not imagine an Englishman in any other capacity save as the\r\nchampion of the forlorn cause; one of the principal reasons why she\r\nhad always disliked the Eglintons was because they held themselves\r\naloof from the knot of friends who gathered round Charles Edward.\r\n\r\nShe was, therefore, not a little surprised to hear \"le petit Anglais\"\r\npromising at least loyal aid and succour in case of disaster, since he\r\ncould not give active support to the proposed expedition. That he had\r\nmade no idle boast when he spoke of Eglinton money she knew quite\r\nwell, nor was it said in vain arrogance, merely as a statement of\r\nfact. Milady's vexation proved that it was true.\r\n\r\nDelighted and eager, she threw herself with all the ardour of her\r\nromantic impulses into this new train of thought suggested by Lord\r\nEglinton's halting speech.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, milor,\" she said joyously, and not heeding Lady Eglinton's scowl,\r\n\"now that I have an ally in you my dream can become a reality. Nay,\r\nSire, you shall start for England with every hope, every assurance of\r\nsuccess, but if you fail, you and those you care for shall be safe.\r\nWill you listen to my plan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Willingly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord Eglinton is your friend--at least, you trust him, do you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust absolutely in the loyalty of his house toward mine,\" replied\r\nCharles Edward unhesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\"Then do you agree with him, and with him alone, on a spot in England\r\nor Scotland where a ship would find you in case of failure.\"\r\n\r\n\"That has been done already,\" said Eglinton simply.\r\n\r\n\"And if ill-luck pursues us, we will make straight for that spot and\r\nawait salvation from France.\"\r\n\r\nLydie said no more; she was conscious of a distinct feeling of\r\ndisappointment that her own plan should have been forestalled. She had\r\nfondled the notion, born but a moment ago, that if her own influence\r\nwere not sufficiently great in the near future to induce King Louis to\r\nsend a rescue ship for the Young Pretender if necessary, she could\r\nthen, with Lord Eglinton's money, fit out a private expedition and\r\nsnatch the last of the Stuarts from the vengeance of his enemies. The\r\nromantic idea had appealed to her, and she had been forestalled. She\r\ntried to read the thoughts of those around her. Lady Eglinton was\r\nevidently ignorant of the details of the plan; she seemed surprised\r\nand vastly disapproving. Charles Edward was whispering a few hasty\r\nwords in the ear of his friend, whom obviously he trusted more than he\r\ndid the word of France or the enthusiasm of Mlle. d'Aumont.\r\n\r\n\"Le petit Anglais\" had relapsed into his usual state of nervousness,\r\nand his eyes wandered uneasily from Lydie's face to that of his royal\r\ncompanion, whilst with restless fingers he fidgeted the signet ring\r\nwhich adorned his left hand. Suddenly he slipped the ring off and\r\nCharles Edward Stuart examined it very attentively, then returned it\r\nto its owner with a keen look of intelligence and a nod of approval.\r\n\r\nLydie was indeed too late with her romantic plan; these two men had\r\nthought it all out before her in every detail--even to the ring. She,\r\ntoo, had thought of a token which would be an assurance to the\r\nfugitives that they might trust the bearer thereof. She felt quite\r\nchildishly vexed at all this. It was an unusual thing in France these\r\ndays to transact serious business without consulting Mlle. d'Aumont.\r\n\r\n\"You are taking it for granted, Sire, that France will fail you?\" she\r\nsaid somewhat testily.\r\n\r\n\"Nay! why should you say that?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! the ring--the obvious understanding between you and milor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it not your wish, Mademoiselle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! a mere suggestion--in case France failed you, and I were\r\npowerless to remind her of her promise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pa ma foi,\" he rejoined gallantly, \"and you'll command me, I'll\r\nbelieve that contingency to be impossible. The whole matter of the\r\nring is a whim of Eglinton's, and I swear that I'll only trust to\r\nFrance and to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" she said quickly, her own sound common sense coming to the\r\nrescue just in time to rout the unreasoning petulance of a while ago,\r\nwhich truly had been unworthy of her. \"It was foolish of me to taunt,\r\nand I pray your Majesty's forgiveness. It would have been joy and\r\npride to me to feel that the plans for your Majesty's safety had been\r\ndevised by me, but I gladly recognize that milor Eglinton hath in this\r\nmatter the prior claim.\"\r\n\r\nHer little speech was delivered so simply and with such a noble air of\r\nself-effacement that it is small wonder that Charles Edward could but\r\nstand in speechless admiration before her. She looked such an\r\nexquisite picture of proud and self-reliant womanhood, as she stood\r\nthere, tall and erect, the stiff folds of her white satin gown\r\nsurrounding her like a frame of ivory round a dainty miniature. Tears\r\nof enthusiasm were in her eyes, her lips were parted with a smile of\r\nencouragement, her graceful head, thrown slightly back and crowned\r\nwith the burnished gold of her hair, stood out in perfect relief\r\nagainst the soft-toned gold and veined marble of the walls.\r\n\r\n\"I entreat you, Mademoiselle,\" said the Young Pretender at last, \"do\r\nnot render my departure too difficult by showing me so plainly all\r\nthat I relinquish when I quit the fair shores of France.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty leaves many faithful hearts in Versailles, none the less\r\ntrue because they cannot follow you. Nay! but methinks Lord Eglinton\r\nand I will have to make a pact of friendship, so that when your\r\nMajesty hath gone we might often speak of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak of me often and to the King,\" rejoined Charles Edward, with a\r\nquick return to his former mood. \"I have a premonition that I shall\r\nhave need of his help.\"\r\n\r\nThen he bowed before her, and she curtsyed very low until her young\r\nhead was almost down to the level of his knees. He took her hand and\r\nkissed it with the respect due to an equal.\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, Sire, and God speed you!\" she murmured. He seemed quite\r\nreluctant to go. Gloom had once more completely settled over his\r\nspirits, and Lydie d'Aumont, clad all in white like some graceful\r\nstatue carved in marble, seemed to him the figure of Hope on which a\r\nrelentless fate forced him to turn his back.\r\n\r\nHis friends now approached and surrounded him. Some were leaving\r\nVersailles and France with him on the morrow, others accompanied him\r\nin spirit only with good wishes and anxious sighs. Charles Edward\r\nStuart, the unfortunate descendant of an unfortunate race, turned with\r\na final appealing look to the man he trusted most.\r\n\r\n\"Be not a broken reed to me, Eglinton,\" he said sadly. \"Try and\r\nprevent France from altogether forgetting me.\"\r\n\r\nLydie averted her head in order to hide the tears of pity which had\r\nrisen to her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, unfortunate Prince! if thine only prop is this poor weakling\r\nwhose dog-like affection has no moral strength to give it support!\"\r\n\r\nWhen she turned once more toward him, ready to bid him a final adieu,\r\nhe was walking rapidly away from her down the long narrow corridor,\r\nleaning on Eglinton's arm and closely surrounded by his friends. In\r\nthe far distance King Louis the Well-beloved strolled leisurely toward\r\nhis departing guest, leaning lightly on the arm of Mme. la Marquise de\r\nPompadour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE LAST TRICK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe noise of talk and laughter still filled the old château from end\r\nto end. Though the special guest of the evening had departed and\r\nroyalty no longer graced the proceedings, since His Majesty had driven\r\naway to Versailles after having bidden adieu to the Chevalier de Saint\r\nGeorge, M. le Duc d'Aumont's less important visitors showed no signs\r\nas yet of wishing to break up this convivial night.\r\n\r\nThe sound of dance music filled the air, and from the _salle d'armes_\r\nthe merry strains of the gavotte, the tripping of innumerable feet,\r\nthe incessant buzz of young voices, reached the more distant corridor\r\nlike an echo from fairyland.\r\n\r\nLydie had remained quite a little while leaning against the cool\r\nmarble wall, watching with eager intentness the group of gallant\r\nEnglish and Scotch gentlemen congregated round their young Prince.\r\nLouis the Well-beloved, with that graciousness peculiar to all the\r\nBourbons, had, severally and individually bidden \"good-bye\" to all.\r\nEach in turn had kissed the podgy white hand of the King of France,\r\nwho had been so benignant a host to them all. None understood better\r\nthan Louis XV, the art of leaving a pleasing impression on the mind of\r\na departing friend. He had a smile, a jest, a word of encouragement\r\nfor each whilst Jeanne de Pompadour, with one dainty hand on the\r\nKing's shoulder, the other flirting her fan, emphasized each token of\r\nroyal goodwill and of royal favour.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! milor Dunkeld, a pleasing journey to you. M. le Marquis de Perth,\r\nI pray you do not, amidst the fogs of England, forget the sunshine of\r\nFrance. Sir André Seafield, your absence will bring many tears to a\r\npair of blue eyes I wot of.\"\r\n\r\nShe pronounced the foreign names with dainty affectation, and Louis\r\nhad much ado to keep his eyes away from that bright, smiling face, and\r\nthose ever-recurring dimples. Lydie felt a strange nausea at sight of\r\nthese noble, high-born gentlemen paying such reverential homage to the\r\nlow-born adventuress, and a deep frown appeared between her eyes when\r\nshe saw Charles Edward Stuart bending as low before Jeanne Poisson as\r\nhe had done just now before her--Lydie, daughter of the Duc d'Aumont.\r\n\r\nBah! what did it matter, after all? This world of irresponsible\r\nbutterflies, of petty machinations and self-seeking intrigues: would\r\nshe not quit it to-morrow for a land of poetry and romance, where\r\nwomen wield no sceptre save that of beauty, and where but one ruler is\r\nacknowledged and his name is Love?\r\n\r\nShe made a strenuous attempt to detach herself mentally from her\r\nsurroundings; with a great effort of her will she succeeded in losing\r\nsight of the individuality of all these people round her. Lady\r\nEglinton still talking at random beside her, Mme. de Pompadour\r\nyielding her hand to the kiss of a Stuart Prince, that fat and pompous\r\nman, whom duty bade her call \"Your Majesty,\" all became mere\r\npuppets--dolls that laughed and chatted and danced, hanging on\r\ninvisible strings, which the mighty hand of some grim giant was\r\ndangling for the amusement of his kind.\r\n\r\nHow paltry it seemed all at once! What did it matter if France was\r\nruled by that vapid King or by that brainless, overdressed woman\r\nbeside him? What did it matter if that young man with the shifty blue\r\neyes and the fair, curly hair succeeded in ousting another man from\r\nthe English throne?\r\n\r\nWhat did matter was that Gaston was not faithless, that he loved her,\r\nand that she had felt the sweetness of a first kiss!\r\n\r\nHappily back in dreamland now, she could once more afford to play her\r\npart amongst the marionettes. She was willing to yield the string\r\nwhich made her dance and talk and move into the hands of the fiercely\r\nhumorous giant up aloft. No doubt it was he who pulled her along the\r\ncorridor, made her join the group that congregated round departing\r\nroyalty.\r\n\r\nM. le Duc d'Aumont--the perfect courtier and gentleman--was already\r\nformulating his adieux. His Majesty the King of France would, by the\r\nrigid rule of etiquette, be the first to leave. Accompanied by Mme. de\r\nPompadour and followed by M. le Duc, he was commencing his progress\r\ndown the monumental staircase which led to the great entrance hall\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nLydie, still made to move no doubt by that invisible giant hand, found\r\nit quite simple and easy to mingle with the crowd, to take the King's\r\narm, being his hostess, whilst M. le Duc her father and Mme. de\r\nPompadour followed close behind.\r\n\r\nWith her spirit wandering in dreamland, she was naturally somewhat\r\ndistraite--not too much so, only sufficiently to cause Louis XV to\r\nmake comparisons betwixt his sprightly Jeanne and this animated\r\nstatue, whose cold little hand rested so impassively on the satin of\r\nhis coat.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the perron the King's Flemish horses, as round of body\r\nand heavy of gait as himself, were impatiently pawing the ground. The\r\nopening of the great gates sent a wave of sweet-scented air into the\r\noverheated château. Lydie was glad that her duty demanded that she\r\nshould accompany the King down the steps to the door of his coach. The\r\ncool night breeze fanned her cheeks most pleasingly, the scent of June\r\nroses and of clove carnations filled the air, and from below the\r\nterraced gardens there came the softly-murmuring ripple of the Seine,\r\nwinding her graceful curves toward the mighty city of Paris beyond.\r\n\r\nFar away to the east, beyond the grim outline of cedar and poplar\r\ntrees, a fair crescent moon appeared, chaste and cold.\r\n\r\n\"An emblem of our fair hostess to-night,\" said Louis with clumsy\r\ngallantry and pointing up to the sky, as Lydie bent her tall figure\r\nand kissed the royal hand.\r\n\r\nThen she stood aside, having made a cold bow to Mme. de Pompadour; the\r\nfair Marquise was accompanying His Majesty to Versailles; she stepped\r\ninto the coach beside him, surrounded by murmurs of flattery and\r\nadulation. Even Charles Edward made her a final speech of somewhat\r\nforced gallantry; he was the last to kiss her hand, and Lydie could\r\nalmost hear the softly whispered words of entreaty with which he bade\r\nher not to forget.\r\n\r\nAnd Jeanne Poisson--daughter of a kitchen wench--was condescendingly\r\ngracious to a Stuart Prince; then she calmly waved him aside, whilst\r\nthe King apparently was content to wait, and called Lady Eglinton to\r\nthe door of the coach.\r\n\r\n\"You are wasting too much time,\" she whispered quickly; \"an you don't\r\nhurry now, you will be too late.\"\r\n\r\nAt last the departure was effected; the crowd, with backbone bent and\r\ntricornes sweeping the ground, waited in that uncomfortable position\r\nuntil the gilded coach and the men in gorgeous blue and gold liveries\r\nwere swallowed in the gloom of the chestnut avenue; then it broke up\r\ninto isolated groups. Lydie had done her duty as hostess; she had\r\ntaken such leave as etiquette demanded from Charles Edward Stuart and\r\nhis friends. Coaches and chairs came up to the perron in quick\r\nsuccession now, bearing the adventurers away on this, the first stage\r\nof their hazardous expedition. When would they sup again in such\r\nluxury? when would the frou-frou of silk, the flutter of fans, the\r\nsound of dance music once more pleasantly tickle their ears?\r\nTo-morrow, and for many a long day to come it would be hurried meals\r\nin out-of-the-way places, the call to horse, the clink of arms.\r\n\r\nPuppets! puppets all! for what did it matter?\r\n\r\nLydie would have loved to have lingered out on the terrace awhile\r\nlonger. The oak-leaved geraniums down at the foot of the terrace steps\r\nthrew an intoxicating lemon-scented fragrance in the air, the row of\r\nstunted orange trees still bore a few tardy blossoms, and in the copse\r\nyonder, away from the din and the bustle made by the marionettes, it\r\nmust be delicious to wander on the carpet of moss and perchance to\r\nhear the melancholy note of a nightingale.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think not, Mademoiselle, that this night air is treacherous?\"\r\nsaid Lord Eglinton, with his accustomed diffidence. \"You seem to be\r\nshivering; will you allow me the honour of bringing your cloak?\"\r\n\r\nShe thanked him quite kindly. Somehow his gentle voice did not jar on\r\nher mood. Since Gaston was not there, she felt that she would sooner\r\nhave this unobtrusive, pleasant man beside her than any one else. He\r\nseemed to have something womanish and tender in his feeble nature\r\nwhich his mother lacked. Perhaps milady had divested herself of her\r\nnatural attributes in order to grace her son with them, since she had\r\nbeen unable to instil more manly qualities into him.\r\n\r\nBut Lydie's heart ached for a sight of Gaston. The clock in the tower\r\nof the old château chimed the hour before midnight. It was but half an\r\nhour since she had parted from him on the steps of the alcove; she\r\nremembered quite distinctly hearing the bracket clock close by strike\r\nhalf-past ten, at the same moment as Pompadour's shrill laugh broke\r\nupon her ear.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour? Why, it seemed a lifetime since then; and while she had\r\nmade her bow to the Stuart Prince and then to King Louis, while she\r\nhad allowed the unseen giant to move her from place to place on a\r\nstring, perhaps Gaston had been seeking for her, perhaps his heart had\r\nlonged for her too, and a sting of jealousy of her multifarious social\r\nduties was even now marring the glory of happy memories.\r\n\r\nWithout another moment's hesitation she turned her back on the\r\npeaceful gloom of the night, on the silver crescent moon, the\r\nfragrance of carnations and orange-blossoms, and walked quickly up the\r\nperron steps with a hasty: \"You are right, milor, the night air is\r\nsomewhat chilling and my guests will be awaiting me,\" thrown over her\r\nshoulder at her bashful cavalier.\r\n\r\nBeyond the noble entrance doors the vast hall was now practically\r\ndeserted, save for a group of flunkeys, gorgeous and solemn, who stood\r\nawaiting the departure of their respective masters. At the farther end\r\nwhich led to the main corridor, Lydie, to her chagrin, caught sight of\r\nLady Eglinton's brobdingnagian back.\r\n\r\n\"What an obsession!\" she sighed, and hoped that milady would fail to\r\nnotice her. Already she was planning hasty flight along a narrow\r\npassage, when a question authoritatively put by her ladyship to a\r\nmagnificent person clad in a purple livery with broad white facings\r\narrested her attention.\r\n\r\n\"Is your master still in the boudoir, do you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know, Mme. la Marquise,\" the man replied. \"I have not seen\r\nM. le Comte since half an hour.\"\r\n\r\nThe purple livery with broad white facings was that of the Comte de\r\nStainville.\r\n\r\n\"I have a message for M. le Comte from Mme. de Pompadour,\" said Lady\r\nEglinton carelessly. \"I'll find him, I daresay.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she turned into the great corridor.\r\n\r\nLydie no longer thought of flight; an unexplainable impulse caught her\r\nto change her mind, and to follow in Lady Eglinton's wake. She could\r\nnot then have said if \"le petit Anglais\" was still near her not. She\r\nhad for the moment forgotten his insignificant existence.\r\n\r\nThere was an extraordinary feeling of unreality about herself and her\r\nmovements, about the voluminous person ahead clad in large-flowered\r\nazure brocade and closely followed by a stiff automaton in purple and\r\nwhite; they seemed to be leading her along some strange and unexpected\r\npaths, at the end of which Lydie somehow felt sure that grinning apes\r\nwould be awaiting her.\r\n\r\nAnon Lady Eglinton paused, with her hand on the handle of a door; she\r\ncaught sight of Mlle. d'Aumont and seemed much surprised to see her\r\nthere. She called to her by name, in that harsh voice which Lydie\r\ndetested, whilst the obsequious automaton came forward and relieved\r\nher from the trouble of turning that handle herself.\r\n\r\n\"Allow me, milady.\"\r\n\r\nThe door flew open, the flunkey at the same moment also drew a heavy\r\ncurtain aside.\r\n\r\nLydie had just come up quite close, in answer to Lady Eglinton's call.\r\nShe was standing facing the door when Bénédict threw it open,\r\nannouncing with mechanical correctness of attitude:\r\n\r\n\"Mme. la Marquise d'Eglinton, M. le Comte!\"\r\n\r\nAt first Lydie only saw Gaston as he turned to face the intruders. His\r\nface was flushed, and he muttered a quickly-suppressed oath. But\r\nalready she had guessed, even before Lady Eglinton's strident voice\r\nhad set her every nerve a-tingling.\r\n\r\n\"Mlle. de Saint Romans!\" said milady, with a shrill laugh, \"a thousand\r\npardons! I had a message from Mme. de Pompadour for M. le Comte de\r\nStainville, and thought to find him alone. A thousand pardons, I\r\nbeg--the intrusion was involuntary--and the message unimportant--I'll\r\ndeliver it when Monsieur is less pleasantly engaged.\"\r\n\r\nLydie at that moment could not have stirred one limb, if her very\r\nlife had depended on a movement from her. The feeling of unreality had\r\ngone. It was no longer that. It was a grim, hideous, awful reality.\r\nThat beautiful woman there was reality, and real, too, were the\r\nglowing eyes that flashed defiance at milady, the lips parted for that\r\nlast kiss which the flunkey's voice had interrupted, the stray black\r\ncurls which had escaped from the trammels of the elaborate coiffure\r\nand lay matted on the damp forehead.\r\n\r\nAnd those roses, too, which had adorned her corsage, now lying broken\r\nand trampled on the floor, the candles burning dimly in their sockets,\r\nand Gaston's look of wrath, quickly followed by one of fear--all--all\r\nthat was real!\r\n\r\nReal to the awful shame of it all--milady's sneer of triumph, the oath\r\nwhich had risen to Gaston's lips, the wooden figure of the lacquey\r\nstanding impassive at the door!\r\n\r\nInstinctively Lydie's hand flew to her lips; oh, that she could have\r\nwiped out the last, lingering memory of that kiss. She, the proud and\r\nreserved vestal, a Diana chaste and cold, with lips now for ever\r\npolluted by contact with those of a liar. A liar, a traitor, a\r\nsycophant! She lashed her haughty spirit into fury, the better to feel\r\nthe utter degradation of her own abasement.\r\n\r\nShe did not speak. What could she say! One look at Gaston's face and\r\nshe understood that her humiliation was complete; his eyes did not\r\neven seek her pardon, they expressed neither sorrow nor shame, only\r\nimpotent wrath and fear of baffled ambition. Not before all these\r\npeople would she betray herself, before that beautiful rival, or that\r\nvulgar _intrigante_, not before Gaston or his lacquey, and beyond that\r\nmechanical movement of hand to lips, beyond one short flash of\r\nunutterable pride and contempt, she remained silent and rigid, whilst\r\nher quick eyes took in a complete mental vision of that never\r\nto-be-forgotten picture--the dimly-lighted boudoir, the defiant figure\r\nof Irène de Saint Romans, the crushed roses on the floor.\r\n\r\nThen with a heart-broken sigh unheard by the other actors in this\r\nmoving tableaux, and covering her face with her hands, she began to\r\nwalk rapidly down the corridor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE WINNING HAND\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Lydie d'Aumont had not gone five paces before she heard a quick,\r\nsharp call, followed by the rustle of silk on the marble floor.\r\n\r\nThe next moment she felt a firm, hot grip on her wrist, and her left\r\nhand was forcibly drawn away from her face, whilst an eager voice\r\nspoke quick, vehement words, the purport of which failed at first to\r\nreach her brain.\r\n\r\n\"You shall not go, Mlle. d'Aumont,\" were the first coherent words\r\nwhich she seemed to understand--\"you cannot--it is not just, not fair\r\nuntil you have heard!\"\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing which I need hear,\" interrupted Lydie coldly, the\r\nmoment she realized that it was Irène de Saint Romans who was\r\naddressing her; \"and I pray you to let me go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay! but you shall hear, you must!\" rejoined the other without\r\nreleasing her grasp on the young girl's wrist. Her hand was hot, and\r\nher fingers had the strength of intense excitement. Lydie could not\r\nfree herself, strive how she might.\r\n\r\n\"Do you not see that this is most unfair?\" continued Irène with great\r\nvolubility. \"Am I to be snubbed like some kitchen wench caught kissing\r\nbehind doorways? Look at milady Eglinton and her ill-natured sneer.\r\nI'll not tolerate it, nor your looks of proud contempt! I'll\r\nnot--I'll not! Gaston! Gaston!\" she now exclaimed, turning to de\r\nStainville, who was standing, silent and sullen, whilst he saw his\r\nwife gradually lashing herself into wrathful agitation at his own\r\nindifference and Lydie's cold disdain. \"If you have a spark of courage\r\nleft in you, tell that malicious _intrigante_ and this scornful minx\r\nthat if I were to spend the whole evening in the boudoir _en\r\ntête-à-tête_ with you, aye! and behind closed doors if I chose who\r\nshall have a word to say, when I am in the company of my own husband?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your husband!\"\r\n\r\nThe ejaculation came from Lady Eglinton's astonished lips. Lydie had\r\nnot stirred. She did not seem to have heard, and certainly Irène's\r\ntriumphant announcement left her as cold, as impassive as before. What\r\ndid it matter, after all, what special form Gaston's lies to her had\r\nassumed? Nothing that he or Irène said or did could add to his\r\nbaseness and infamy.\r\n\r\n\"Aye, my husband, milady!\" continued the other more calmly, as she\r\nfinally released Lydie's wrist and cast it, laughing, from her. \"I am\r\ncalled Mme. la Comtesse de Stainville, and will be called so in the\r\nfuture openly. Now you may rejoin your guests, Mlle. d'Aumont; my\r\nreputation stands as far beyond reproach as did your own before you\r\nspent a mysterious half hour with my husband behind the curtains of an\r\nalcove.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned to de Stainville, who, in spite of his wife's provocative\r\nattitude, had remained silent, cursing the evil fate which had played\r\nhim this trick, cursing the three women who were both the cause and\r\nthe witnesses of his discomfiture.\r\n\r\n\"Your arm, Gaston!\" she said peremptorily; \"and you, Benedict, call\r\nyour master's coach and my chair. Mlle. d'Aumont, your servant. If I\r\nhave been the means of dissipating a happy illusion, you may curse me\r\nnow, but you will bless me to-morrow. Gaston has been false to you--he\r\nis not over true to me--but he is my husband, and as such I must claim\r\nhim. For the sake of his schemes, of his ambitions, I kept our\r\nmarriage a secret so that he might rise to higher places than I had\r\nthe power to give him. When your disdainful looks classed me with a\r\nflirty kitchen-wench I rebelled at last. I trust that you are proud\r\nenough not to vent your disappointment on Gaston; but if you do, 'tis\r\nno matter; I'll find means of consoling him.\"\r\n\r\nShe made the young girl a low and sweeping curtesy in the most\r\napproved style demanded by the elabourate etiquette of the time. There\r\nwas a gleam of mocking triumph in her eyes, which she did not attempt\r\nto conceal, and which suddenly stung Lydie's pride to the quick.\r\n\r\nIt is strange indeed that often at a moment when a woman's whole\r\nhappiness is destroyed with one blow, when a gigantic cataclysm\r\nrevolutionises with one fell swoop her entire mode of thought, dispels\r\nall her dreams and shatters her illusions, it is always the tiny final\r\npin-prick which causes her the most acute pain and influences the\r\nwhole of her subsequent conduct.\r\n\r\nIt was Irène's mocking curtsey which roused Lydie from her mental\r\ntorpor, because it brought her--as it were--in actual physical contact\r\nwith all that she would have to endure openly in the future, as apart\r\nfrom the hidden misery of her heart.\r\n\r\nGaston's shamed face was no longer the only image which seared her\r\neyes and brain. The world, her own social world, seemed all at once to\r\nreawaken before her. That world would sneer even as Irène de\r\nStainville sneered; it would laugh at and enjoy her own discomfiture.\r\nShe--Lydie d'Aumont--the proud and influential daughter of the Prime\r\nMinister of France, whom flatterers and sycophants approached mentally\r\non bended knees, for whom suitors hardly dared even to sigh, she had\r\nbeen tricked and fooled like any silly country mouse whose vanity had\r\nled to her own abasement.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour ago in the fullness of her newly-found happiness she had\r\nflaunted her pride and her love before those who hated and envied her.\r\nTo-morrow--nay, within an hour--this humiliating scene would be the\r\ntalk of Paris and Versailles. Lydie's burning ears seemed even now to\r\nhear the Pompadour retailing it with many embellishments, which would\r\nbring a coarse laugh to the lips of the King and an ill-natured jest\r\nto those of her admirers; she could hear the jabbering crowd, could\r\nfeel the looks of compassion or sarcasm aimed at her as soon at this\r\ntit-bit of society scandal had been bruited abroad.\r\n\r\nThe scene itself had become real and vivid to her; the marble\r\ncorridor, the flickering candles, the flunkey's impassive face; she\r\nunderstood that the beautiful woman before her was in fact and deed\r\nthe wife of Gaston de Stainville. She even contrived to perceive the\r\nhumour of Lady Eglinton's completely bewildered expression, the blank\r\nastonishment of her round, bulgy eyes, and close to her she saw \"le\r\npetit Anglais,\" self-effaced as usual, and looking almost as guilty,\r\nas shamefaced as Gaston.\r\n\r\nLydie turned to him and placed a cool, steady hand upon his sleeve.\r\n\r\n\"Madame la Comtesse de Stainville,\" she then said with perfect calm,\r\n\"I fear me I must beg of your courtesy to tarry awhile longer, whilst\r\nI offer you an explanation to which I feel you are entitled. Just now\r\nI was somewhat surprised because your news was sudden--and it is my\r\nturn to ask your pardon, although my fault--if fault there be--rests\r\non a misapprehension. M. le Comte de Stainville's amours or his\r\nmarriage are no concern of mine. True, he begged for my influence and\r\nfawned upon my favour just now, for his ambition soared to the post of\r\nHigh Controller of the Finances of France. That appointment rests with\r\nthe Duc, my father, who no doubt will bestow it on him whom he thinks\r\nmost worthy. But it were not fair to me, if you left me now thinking\r\nthat the announcement of your union with a gentleman whose father was\r\nthe friend of mine could give me aught but pleasure. Permit me to\r\ncongratulate you, Madame, on the choice of a lord and master, a\r\nhelpmeet no doubt. You are indeed well matched. I am all the more\r\neager to offer you my good wishes as I have been honoured to-night\r\nwith a proposal which has greatly flattered me. My lord the Marquis of\r\nEglinton has asked me to be his wife!\"\r\n\r\nOnce more she turned her head toward the young Englishman and\r\nchallenged a straight look from his eyes. He did not waver and she was\r\nsatisfied. Her instinct had not misled her, for he expressed no\r\nastonishment, only a sort of dog-like gratitude and joy as, having\r\nreturned her gaze quite firmly, he now slowly raised his arm bringing\r\nher hand on a level with his lips.\r\n\r\nLady Eglinton also displayed sufficient presence of mind not to show\r\nany surprise. She perhaps alone of all those present fully realized\r\nthat Lydie had been wounded to the innermost depths of her heart, and\r\nthat she herself owed her own and her son's present triumph to the\r\nrevolt of mortified pride.\r\n\r\nWhat Gaston thought and felt exactly it were difficult to say. He held\r\nwomen in such slight esteem, and his own vanity was receiving so\r\nsevere a blow, that, no doubt, he preferred to think that Lydie, like\r\nhimself, had no power of affection and merely bestowed her heart there\r\nwhere self-interest called.\r\n\r\nIrène, on the other hand, heaved a sigh of relief; the jealous\r\nsuspicions which had embittered the last few days were at last\r\ndispelled. Hers was a simple, shallow nature that did not care to look\r\nbeyond the obvious. She certainly appeared quite pleased at Lydie's\r\nannouncement, and if remorse at her precipitancy did for one brief\r\nsecond mar the fullness of her joy, she quickly cast it from her, not\r\nhaving yet had time to understand the future and more serious\r\nconsequences of her impulsive avowal.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to go up to Lydie and to offer her vapid expressions of\r\ngoodwill, but Gaston, heartily tired of the prolongation of this\r\nscene, dragged her somewhat roughly away.\r\n\r\nFrom the far distance there came the cry of the flunkeys.\r\n\r\n\"The chair of Mlle. de Saint Romans!\"\r\n\r\n\"The coach of M. le Comte de Stainville!\"\r\n\r\nM. Bénédict, resplendent in purple and white, reappeared at the end of\r\nthe corridor, with Irène's hood and cloak. Gaston, with his wife on\r\nhis arm, turned on his heel and quickly walked down the corridor.\r\n\r\nMilady, puzzled, bewildered, boundlessly overjoyed yet fearing to\r\ntrust her luck too far, had just a sufficient modicum of tact left in\r\nher to retire discreetly within the boudoir.\r\n\r\nLydie suddenly found herself alone in this wide corridor with the man\r\nwhom she had so impulsively dragged into her life. She looked round\r\nher somewhat helplessly, and her eyes encountered those of her future\r\nlord fixed upon hers with that same air of dog-like gentleness which\r\nshe knew so well and which always irritated her.\r\n\r\n\"Milor,\" she said very coldly, \"I must thank you for your kind\r\ncoöperation just now. That you expressed neither surprise nor\r\nresentment does infinite credit to your chivalry.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I was a little surprised, Mademoiselle,\" he said, haltingly, \"I\r\nwas too overjoyed to show it, and--and I certainly felt no\r\nresentment.\"\r\n\r\nHe came a step nearer to her. But for this she was not prepared, and\r\ndrew back with a quick movement and a sudden stiffening of her figure.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you quite understood milor, that there is no desire on my part\r\nto hold you to this bond,\" she said icily. \"I am infinitely grateful\r\nto you for the kind way in which you humoured my impulse to-night, and\r\nif you will have patience with me but a very little while, I promise\r\nyou that I will find an opportunity for breaking, without too great a\r\nloss of dignity, these bonds which already must be very irksome to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, Mademoiselle,\" he said gently, \"you are under a misapprehension.\r\nBelieve me, you would find it well-nigh impossible to--to--er--to\r\nalter your plans now without loss of dignity, and--er--er--I assure\r\nyou that the bonds are not irksome to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would hold me to this bargain, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"For your sake, Mademoiselle, as well as mine, we must now both be\r\nheld to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems unfair on you, milor.\"\r\n\r\n\"On me, Mademoiselle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, on you,\" she repeated, with a thought more gentleness in her\r\nvoice; \"you are young, milor; you are rich--soon you will regret the\r\nsense of honour which ties you to a woman who has only yielded her\r\nhand to you out of pique! Nay, I'll not deceive you,\" she added\r\nquickly, noting the sudden quiver of the kind little face at her\r\nstinging words. \"I have no love for you, milor--all that was young and\r\nfresh, womanly and tender in my heart was buried just here to-night.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with a mournful look she glanced round at the cold marble of the\r\nwalls, the open door to that boudoir beyond, the gilded sconces which\r\nsupported the dimly-burning candles. Then, smitten with sudden\r\nremorse, she said eagerly, with one of those girlish impulses which\r\nrendered her domineering nature so peculiarly attractive:\r\n\r\n\"But if I can give you no love, milor, Heaven and my father's\r\nindulgence have given me something which I know men hold far greater\r\nof importance than a woman's heart. I have influence, boundless\r\ninfluence, as you know--the State appointed Controller of Finance will\r\nbe the virtual ruler of France, his position will give him power\r\nbeyond the dreams of any man's ambition. My father will gladly give\r\nthe post to my husband and--\"\r\n\r\nBut here a somewhat trembling hand was held deprecatingly toward her.\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle, I entreat you,\" said Lord Eglinton softly, \"for the\r\nsake of your own dignity and--and mine, do not allow your mind to\r\ndwell on such matters. Believe me, I am fully conscious of the honour\r\nwhich you did me just now in deigning to place your trust in me. That\r\nI have--have loved you, Mlle. Lydie,\" he added, with a nervous quiver\r\nin his young voice, \"ever since I first saw you at this Court I--I\r\ncannot deny; but\"--and here he spoke more firmly, seeing that once\r\nagain she seemed to draw away from him, to stiffen at his approach,\r\n\"but that simple and natural fact need not trouble you. I could not\r\nhelp loving you, for you are more beautiful than anything on earth,\r\nand you cannot deem my adoration an offence, though you are as cold\r\nand pure as the goddess of chastity herself. I have seen Catholics\r\nkneeling at the shrine of the Virgin Mary; their eyes were fixed up to\r\nher radiant image, their lips murmured an invocation or sometimes a\r\nhymn of praise. But their hands were clasped together; they never even\r\nraised them once toward that shrine which they had built for her, and\r\nfrom which she smiled whilst listening coldly to their prayers. Mlle.\r\nd'Aumont, you need have no mistrust of my deep respect for you; you\r\nare the Madonna and I the humblest of your worshippers. I am proud to\r\nthink that the name I bear will be the shrine wherein your pride will\r\nremain enthroned. If you have need of me in the future you must\r\ncommand me, but though the law of France will call me your husband and\r\nyour lord, I will be your bondsman and serve you on my knees; and\r\nthough my very soul aches for the mere touch of your hand, my lips\r\nwill never pollute even the hem of your gown.\" His trembling voice had\r\nsunk down to a whisper. If she heard or not he could not say. From far\r\naway there came to his ears the tender melancholy drone of the\r\ninstruments playing the slow movement of the gavotte. His Madonna had\r\nnot stirred, only her hand which he so longed to touch trembled a\r\nlittle as she toyed with her fan.\r\n\r\nAnd, like the worshippers at the Virgin's shrine, he bent his knee and\r\nknelt at her feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nTHE STATESMAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE BEGGAR ON HORSEBACK\r\n\r\n\r\nMonsieur le Marquis d'Eglinton, Comptroller-General of Finance,\r\nChevalier of the Order of St. Louis, Peer of England and of France,\r\noccupied the west wing of the Château of Versailles. His Majesty the\r\nKing had frequent and urgent need of him; Mme. de Pompadour could\r\nscarce exist a day without an interview behind closed doors with the\r\nmost powerful man in France: with him, who at the bidding of the\r\nnation, was set up as a bar to the extravagances of her own caprice.\r\n\r\nAnd _le petit lever_ of M. le Contrôleur was certainly more largely\r\nattended than that of M. le Duc d'Aumont, or even--softly be it\r\nwhispered--than that of His Majesty himself. For although every one\r\nknew that M. le Marquis was but a figurehead, and that all graces and\r\nfavours emanated direct from the hand of Mme. la Marquise Lydie, yet\r\nevery one waited upon his good pleasure, for very much the same reason\r\nthat those who expected or hoped something from the King invariably\r\nkissed the hand of Mme. de Pompadour.\r\n\r\nM. le Contrôleur very much enjoyed these _petits levers_ of his, which\r\nwere considered the most important social events in Versailles. He was\r\nvery fond of chocolate in the morning, and M. Achille--that prince of\r\nvalets--brought it to his bedside with such inimitable grace and\r\nwithal the beverage itself so aromatic and so hot, that this hour\r\nbetween ten and eleven each day had become extremely pleasant.\r\n\r\nHe had no idea that being Comptroller-General of Finance was quite so\r\neasy and agreeable an occupation, else he had not been so diffident in\r\naccepting the post. But in reality it was very simple. He governed\r\nFrance from the depths of his extremely comfortable bed, draped all\r\nround with rich satin hangings of a soft azure colour, embroidered\r\nwith _motifs_ of dull gold, which were vastly pleasing to the eye.\r\nHere he was conscious of naught save fine linen of a remarkably silken\r\ntexture, of a lace coverlet priceless in value, of the scent of his\r\nsteaming chocolate, and incidentally of a good many pleasant faces,\r\nand some unamiable ones, and of a subdued hive-like buzz of talk,\r\nwhich went on at the further end of the room, whilst M. Achille\r\nadministered to his comforts and Mme. de Pompadour or Mme. la Comtesse\r\nde Stainville told him piquant anecdotes.\r\n\r\nYes, it was all very pleasant, and not at all difficult. A wave of the\r\nhand in the direction of Mme. la Marquise, his wife, who usually sat\r\nin a window embrasure overlooking the park, was all that was needed\r\nwhen petitioners were irksome or subjects too abstruse.\r\n\r\nLydie was so clever with all that sort of thing. She had the mind of a\r\npolitician and the astuteness of an attorney, and she liked to govern\r\nFrance in an energetic way of her own which left milor free of all\r\nresponsibility if anything happened to go wrong.\r\n\r\nBut then nothing ever did go wrong. France went on just the same as\r\nshe had done before some of her more meddlesome Parliaments insisted\r\non having a Comptroller of Finance at the head of affairs. Mme. de\r\nPompadour still spent a great deal of money, and the King still\r\ninvariably paid her debts; whereupon, his pockets being empty, he\r\napplied to M. le Contrôleur for something with which to replenish\r\nthem. M. le Contrôleur thereupon ordered M. Achille to bring one more\r\ncup of aromatic chocolate for Mme. de Pompadour, whilst His Majesty\r\nthe King spent an uncomfortable quarter of an hour with Mme. la\r\nMarquise d'Eglinton.\r\n\r\nThe usual result of this quarter of an hour was that His Majesty was\r\nexcessively wrathful against Mme. Lydie for quite a fortnight; but no\r\none could be angry with \"le petit Anglais,\" for he was so very amiable\r\nand dispensed such exceedingly good chocolate.\r\n\r\nPar ma foi! it is remarkably easy to govern a country if one happen to\r\nhave a wife--that, at least, had been milor's experience--a wife and a\r\nperfect valet-de-chambre.\r\n\r\nM. Achille, since his Marquis's elevation to the most important\r\nposition in France, had quite surpassed himself in his demeanour. He\r\nstood on guard beside the azure and gold hangings of his master's bed\r\nlike a veritable gorgon, turning the most importunate petitioners to\r\nstone at sight of his severe and repressive visage.\r\n\r\nOh! Achille was an invaluable asset in the governing of this kingdom\r\nof France. Achille knew the reason of each and every individual's\r\npresence at the _petit lever_ of milor. He knew who was the most\r\nlikely and most worthy person to fill any post in the country that\r\nhappened to be vacant, from that of examiner of stars and planets to\r\nHis Majesty the King down to that of under-scullion in the kitchen of\r\nVersailles.\r\n\r\nHad he not been the means of introducing Baptiste Durand to the\r\nspecial notice of M. le Marquis? Durand's daughter being\r\ngirl-in-waiting to M. Joseph, valet-de-chambre to M. le Duc d'Aumont,\r\nand personal friend of M. Achille, what more natural than, when milor\r\nwanted a secretary to make notes for him, and to--well, to be present\r\nif he happened to be wanted--that the worthy Baptiste should with\r\nperfect ease slip into the vacant post?\r\n\r\nAnd Baptiste Durand was remarkably useful.\r\n\r\nA small ante-chamber had been allotted for his occupation, through\r\nwhich all those who were on their way to the _petit lever_ held in\r\nmilor's own bedchamber had of necessity to pass; and Baptiste knew\r\nexactly who should be allowed to pass and who should not. Without\r\nventuring even to refer to His Majesty, to Mme. de Pompadour, to\r\nMonseigneur le Dauphin, or persons of equally exalted rank, the\r\nfaithful chroniclers of the time tell us that no gentleman was allowed\r\na private audience with M. le Contrôleur-Général if his\r\nvalet-de-chambre was not a personal friend of Monsieur Durand.\r\n\r\nThere sat the worthy Baptiste enthroned behind a secretaire which was\r\nalways littered with papers, petitions, letters, the usual\r\nparaphernalia that pertains to a man of influence. His meagre person\r\nwas encased in a coat and breeches of fine scarlet cloth, whereon a\r\ntiny fillet of gold suggested without unduly flaunting the heraldic\r\ncolours of the house of Eglinton. He wore silk stockings--always; and\r\nshoes with cut-steel buckles, whilst frills of broidered lawn\r\nencircled his wrists and cascaded above his waistcoat.\r\n\r\nHe invariably partook of snuff when an unknown and unrecommended\r\napplicant presented himself in his sanctum. \"My good friend, it is\r\nimpossible,\" he was saying on this very morning of August 13, 1746,\r\nwith quiet determination to a petitioner who was becoming too\r\ninsistent. \"Milor's chamber is overcrowded as it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll call again--another day perhaps; my master is anxious for a\r\npersonal interview with yours.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon M. Durand's eyebrows were lifted upward until they almost\r\ncame in contact with his perruque; he fetched out a voluminous\r\nhandkerchief from his pocket and carefully removed a few grains of\r\ndust from his cravat. Then he said, without raising his voice in the\r\nslightest degree or showing impatience in any way at the man's\r\nignorance and stupidity--\r\n\r\n\"My good---- What is your name? I forgot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am Hypolite François, confidential valet to M. le Maréchal de\r\nCoigni and----\"\r\n\r\nM. Durand's thin and delicately veined hand went up in gentle\r\ndeprecation.\r\n\r\n\"Ma foi! my worthy Coigni, 'tis all the same to me if you are a\r\nmaréchal or a simple lieutenant. As for me, young man,\" he added, with\r\ndignified severity, \"remember in future that I serve no one. I assist\r\nM. le Contrôleur-Général des Finances to--to----\"--he paused a second,\r\nwaving his hand and turning the phrase over in his mouth, whilst\r\nseeking for its most appropriate conclusion--\"to, in fact, make a\r\nworthy selection amidst the hundreds and thousands of petitions which\r\nare presented to him.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with a vague gesture he indicated the papers which lay in a\r\ndisordered heap on his secretaire.\r\n\r\n\"For the rest, my good Coigni,\" he added, with the same impressive\r\ndignity, \"let me assure you once again that M. le Marquis's bedchamber\r\nis overcrowded, that he is busily engaged at the present moment, and\r\nis likely to be so for some considerable time to come. What is it your\r\nmaréchal wants?\"\r\n\r\n\"His pension,\" replied Hypolite curtly, \"and the vacant post in the\r\nMinistry of War.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible! We have fourteen likely applicants already.\"\r\n\r\n\"M. le Maréchal is sure that if he could speak with M. le\r\nContrôleur----\"\r\n\r\n\"M. le Contrôleur is busy.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow, then----\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow he will be even more busy than to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"M. Durand!\" pleaded Hypolite.\r\n\r\n\"Impossible! You are wasting my time, my good Coigni; I have hundreds\r\nto see to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not for your daughter's sake?\"\r\n\r\n\"My daughter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; didn't you know? You remember Henriette, her great friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes--little Henriette Dessy, the milliner,\" assented M. Durand\r\nwith vast condescension. \"A pretty wench; she was at the Ursulines\r\nconvent school with my daughter; they have remained great friends ever\r\nsince. What about little Henriette?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mlle. Henriette is my _fiancée_,\" quoth the other eagerly, \"and I\r\nthought----\"\r\n\r\n\"Your _fiancée_? Little Henriette Dessy?\" said M. Durand gaily.\r\n\"Pardieu my good Coigni, why did you not tell me so before? My\r\ndaughter is very fond of Henriette--a pretty minx, par ma foi! Hé!\r\nhé!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very kind, M. Durand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mais non, mais non,\" said the great man, with much affability; \"one\r\nis always ready to oblige a friend. Hé, now! give me your hand, friend\r\nCoigni. Shoot your rubbish along--quoi!--your Maréchal; he may pass\r\nthis way. Anything one can do to oblige a friend.\"\r\n\r\nWith the affairs of M. le Maréchal de Coigni the present chronicle\r\nhath no further concern; but we know that some ten minutes later on\r\nthis same August 13, 1746, he succeeded in being present at the _petit\r\nlever_ of M. le Contrôleur-Général des Finances. Once within the\r\nsecret precincts of the bedchamber he, like so many other petitioners\r\nand courtiers, was duly confronted by the stony stare of M. Achille,\r\nand found himself face to face with an enormous bedstead of delicately\r\npainted satinwood and ormulu mounts, draped with heavy azure silk\r\ncurtains which hung down from a gilded baldachin, the whole a\r\nmasterpiece of the furniture-maker's art.\r\n\r\nThe scent of chocolate filled his nostrils, and he vaguely saw a\r\ngood-looking young man reclining under a coverlet of magnificent\r\nVenetian lace, and listening placidly to what was obviously a very\r\namusing tale related to him by well-rouged lips. From the billowy\r\nsatins and laces of the couch a delicate hand was waved toward him as\r\nhe attempted to pay his respects to the most powerful man in France;\r\nthe next moment the same stony-faced gorgon clad in scarlet and gold\r\nbeckoned to him to follow, and he found himself being led through the\r\nbrilliantly dressed crowd toward a compact group of backs, which\r\nformed a sort of living wall, painted in delicate colours of green and\r\nmauve and gray, and duly filled up the approach to the main window\r\nembrasure.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note from the memoirs of M. le Comte d'Argenson\r\nthat the Maréchal de Coigni duly filled the post of State Secretary to\r\nthe Minister of War from the year 1746 onward. We may, therefore,\r\npresume that he succeeded in piercing that wall of respectful backs\r\nand in reaching sufficiently far within the charmed circle to attract\r\nthe personal attention of Mme. la Marquise Lydie d'Eglinton _née_\r\nd'Aumont.\r\n\r\nHe had, therefore, cause to bless the day when his valet-de-chambre\r\nbecame the _fiancé_ of Mlle. Henriette Dessy, the intimate friend of\r\nM. Baptiste Durand's dearly beloved daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nLA BELLE IRÈNE\r\n\r\n\r\nMonsieur Durand had indeed not exaggerated when he spoke of M. le\r\nContrôleur's bedchamber being overcrowded this same eventful morning.\r\n\r\nAll that France possessed of nobility, of wit and of valour, seemed to\r\nhave found its way on this beautiful day in August past the magic\r\nportal guarded by Baptiste, the dragon, to the privileged enclosure\r\nbeyond, where milor in elegant _robe de chambre_ reclined upon his\r\ngorgeous couch, whilst Madame, clad in hooped skirt and panniers of\r\ndove-gray silk, directed the affairs of France from the embrasure of a\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\"Achille, my shoes!\"\r\n\r\nWe must surmise that his lordship had been eagerly awaiting the\r\nstriking of the bracket clock which immediately faced the bed, for the\r\nmoment the musical chimes had ceased to echo in the crowded room he\r\nhad thrown aside the lace coverlet which had lain across his legs and\r\ncalled peremptorily for his valet.\r\n\r\n\"Only half-past ten, milor!\" came in reproachful accents from a pair\r\nof rosy lips.\r\n\r\n\"Ma foi, so it is!\" exclaimed Lord Eglinton, with well-feigned\r\nsurprise, as he once more glanced up at the clock.\r\n\r\n\"Were you then so bored in my company,\" rejoined the lady, with a\r\npout, \"that you thought the hour later?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bored!\" he exclaimed. \"Bored, did you say, Madame? Perish the very\r\nthought of boredom in the presence of Mme. la Comtesse de Stainville!\"\r\n\r\nBut in spite of this gallant assertion, M. le Contrôleur seemed in a\r\nvast hurry to quit the luxuriance of his azure-hung throne. M.\r\nAchille--that paragon among flunkeys--looked solemnly reproachful.\r\nSurely milor should have known by now that etiquette demanded that he\r\nshould stay in bed until he had received every person of high rank who\r\ndesired an intimate audience.\r\n\r\nThere were still some high-born, exalted, and much beribboned\r\ngentlemen who had not succeeded in reaching the inner precincts of\r\nthat temple and fount of honours and riches--the bedside of M. le\r\nContrôleur. But Monseigneur le Prince de Courtenai was there--he in\r\nwhose veins flowed royal blood, and who spent a strenuous life in\r\nendeavouring to make France recognize this obvious fact. He sat in an\r\narm-chair at the foot of the bed, discussing the unfortunate events of\r\nJune 16th at Piacenza and young Comte de Maillebois's subsequent\r\nmasterly retreat on Tortone, with Christian Louis de Montmorenci, Duc\r\nde Luxembourg, the worthy son of an able father and newly created\r\nMarshal of France.\r\n\r\nClose to them, Monsieur le Comte de Vermandois, Grand Admiral of\r\nFrance, was intent on explaining to M. le Chancelier d'Aguesseau why\r\nEngland just now was supreme mistress of the seas. M. d'Isenghien\r\ntalked poetry to Jolyot Crébillon, and M. le Duc d'Harcourt discussed\r\nVoltaire's latest play with ex-comedian and ex-ambassador\r\nNéricault-Destouche, whilst Mme. la Comtesse de Stainville, still\r\ncalled \"la belle brune de Bordeaux\" by her many admirers, had been\r\nendeavouring to divert M. le Contrôleur's attention from this\r\nmultiplicity of abstruse subjects.\r\n\r\nOutside this magic circle there was a gap, a barrier of parquet\r\nflooring which no one would dare to traverse without a distinct look\r\nof encouragement from M. Achille. His Majesty had not yet arrived, and\r\ntongues wagged freely in the vast and gorgeous room, with its row of\r\ntall windows which gave on the great slopes of the Park of Versailles.\r\nThrough them came the pleasing sound of the perpetual drip from the\r\nmonumental fountains, the twitter of sparrows, the scent of lingering\r\nroses and of belated lilies. No other sound from that outside world,\r\nno other life save the occasional footstep of a gardener along the\r\nsanded walks. But within all was chatter and bustle; women talked, men\r\nlaughed and argued, society scandals were commented upon and the\r\nnewest fashions in coiffures discussed. The men wore cloth coats of\r\nsober hues, but the women had donned light-coloured dresses, for the\r\nsummer was at its height and this August morning was aglow with\r\nsunshine.\r\n\r\nMme. de Stainville's rose-coloured gown was the one vivid patch of\r\ncolour in the picture of delicate hues. She stood close to M. le\r\nContrôleur's bedside and unceremoniously turned her back on the rest\r\nof the company; we must presume that she was a very privileged\r\nvisitor, for no one--not even Monseigneur le Prince de\r\nCourtenai--ventured to approach within earshot. It was understood that\r\nin milor's immediate entourage la belle Irène alone was allowed to be\r\nfrivolous, and we are told that she took full advantage of this\r\npermission.\r\n\r\nAll chroniclers of the period distinctly aver that the lady was vastly\r\nentertaining; even M. de Voltaire mentions her as one of the\r\nsprightliest women of that light-hearted and vivacious Court.\r\nBeautiful, too, beyond cavil, her position as the wife of one of the\r\nmost brilliant cavaliers that e'er graced the entourage of Mme. de\r\nPompadour gave her a certain dignity of bearing, a self-conscious gait\r\nand proud carriage of the head which had considerably added to the\r\ncharms which she already possessed. The stiff, ungainly mode of the\r\nperiod suited her somewhat full figure to perfection; the tight\r\ncorslet bodice, the wide panniers, the ridiculous hooped skirt--all\r\nseemed to have been specially designed to suit the voluptuous beauty\r\nof Irène de Stainville.\r\n\r\nM. d'Argenson when speaking of her has described her very fully. He\r\nspeaks of her abnormally small waist, which seemed to challenge the\r\nsupport of a masculine arm, and of her creamy skin which she knew so\r\nwell how to veil in transparent folds of filmy lace. She made of dress\r\na special study, and her taste, though daring, was always sure. Even\r\nduring these early morning receptions, when soft-toned mauves, tender\r\ndrabs or grays were mostly in evidence, Irène de Stainville usually\r\nappeared in brocade of brilliant rosy-red, turquoise blue, or emerald\r\ngreen; she knew that these somewhat garish tones, mellowed only\r\nthrough the richness of the material, set off to perfection the matt\r\nivory tint of her complexion, and detached her entire person from the\r\nrest of the picture.\r\n\r\nYet even her most ardent admirers tell us that Irène de Stainville's\r\nvanity went almost beyond the bounds of reason in its avidity for\r\nfulsome adulation. Consciousness of her own beauty was not sufficient;\r\nshe desired its acknowledgment from others. She seemed to feed on\r\nflattery, breathing it in with every pore of her delicate skin,\r\ndrooping like a parched flower when full measure was denied to her.\r\nMany aver that she marred her undoubted gifts of wit through this\r\ninsatiable desire for one sole topic of conversation--her own beauty\r\nand its due meed of praise. At the same time her love of direct and\r\nobsequious compliments was so ingenuous, and she herself so undeniably\r\nfascinating, that, in the hey-day of her youth and attractions, she\r\nhad no difficulty in obtaining ready response to her wishes from the\r\nhighly susceptible masculine element at the Court of Louis XV.\r\n\r\nM. le Contrôleur-Général--whom she specially honoured with her\r\nsmiles--had certainly no intention of shirking the pleasing duty\r\nattached to this distinction, and, though he was never counted a\r\nbrilliant conversationalist, he never seemed at a loss for the exact\r\nword of praise which would tickle la belle Irène's ears most\r\npleasantly.\r\n\r\nAnd truly no man's heart could be sufficiently adamant to deny to that\r\nbrilliantly-plumaged bird the tit-bits which it loved the best. Milor\r\nhimself had all the sensitiveness of his race where charms--such as\r\nIrène freely displayed before him--were concerned, and when her\r\nsmiling lips demanded acknowledgment of her beauty from him he was\r\nready enough to give it.\r\n\r\n\"Let them settle the grave affairs of State over there,\" she had said\r\nto him this morning, when first she made her curtsey before him. And\r\nwith a provocative smile she pointed to the serious-looking group of\r\ngrave gentlemen that surrounded his bedside, and also to the compact\r\nrow of backs which stood in serried ranks round Mme. la Marquise\r\nd'Eglinton in the embrasure of the central window. \"Life is too short\r\nfor such insignificant trifles.\"\r\n\r\n\"We only seem to last long enough to make love thoroughly to half a\r\ndozen pretty women in a lifetime,\" replied M. le Contrôleur, as he\r\ngallantly raised her fingers to his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Half a dozen!\" she retorted, with a pout. \"Ah, milor, I see that your\r\ncountrymen are not maligned! The English have such a reputation for\r\nperfidy!\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have become so entirely French!\" he protested. \"England would\r\nscarce know me now.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with a whimsical gesture he pointed to the satin hangings of his\r\nbed, the rich point lace coverlet, and to his own very elaborate and\r\nelegant _robe de chambre_.\r\n\r\n\"Is that said in regret?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" he replied, \"there is no more place for regret than there is\r\nfor boredom in sight of smiles from those perfect lips.\"\r\n\r\nShe blushed, and allowed her hands--which were particularly\r\nbeautiful--to finger idly the silks and laces which were draped so\r\ntastefully about his person. As her eyes were downcast in dainty and\r\nbecoming confusion, she failed to notice that M. le Contrôleur was\r\nsomewhat absent-minded this morning, and that, had he dared, he would\r\nat this juncture undoubtedly have yawned. But of this she was\r\nobviously unconscious, else she had not now murmured so persuasively.\r\n\r\n\"Am I beautiful?\"\r\n\r\n\"What a question!\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"The most beautiful woman here present?\" she insisted.\r\n\r\n\"Par ma foi!\" he protested gaily. \"Was ever married man put in so\r\nawkward a predicament?\"\r\n\r\n\"Married man? Bah!\" and she shrugged her pretty shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"I am a married man, fair lady, and the law forbids me to answer so\r\nprovoking a question.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is cowardly evasion,\" she rejoined. \"Mme. la Marquise, your\r\nwife, only acknowledges one supremacy--that of the mind. She would\r\nscorn to be called the most beautiful woman in the room.\"\r\n\r\n\"And M. le Comte de Stainville, your lord, would put a hole right\r\nthrough my body were I now to speak the unvarnished truth.\"\r\n\r\nIrène apparently chose to interpret milor's equivocal speech in the\r\nmanner most pleasing to her self-love. She looked over her shoulder\r\ntoward the window embrasure. She saw that Mme. la Marquise\r\nd'Eglinton's court was momentarily dismissed, and that M. le Duc\r\nd'Aumont had just joined his daughter. She also saw that Lydie looked\r\ntroubled, and that she threw across the room a look of haughty\r\nreproof.\r\n\r\nNothing could have pleased Irène de Stainville more.\r\n\r\nApart from the satisfaction which her own inordinate vanity felt at\r\nthe present moment by enchaining milor's attention and receiving his\r\nundivided homage in full sight of the _élite_ of aristocratic\r\nVersailles, there was the additional pleasure of dealing a pin-prick\r\nor so to a woman who had once been her rival, and who was undoubtedly\r\nnow the most distinguished as she was the most adulated personality in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nIrène had never forgiven Lydie Gaston's defalcations on that memorable\r\nnight, when a humiliating exposure and subsequent scene led to the\r\ndisclosure of her own secret marriage, and thus put a momentary check\r\non her husband's ambitious schemes.\r\n\r\nFrom that check he had since then partially recovered. Mme. de\r\nPompadour's good graces which she never wholly withdrew from him had\r\ngiven him a certain position of influence and power, from which his\r\nlack of wealth would otherwise have debarred him. But even with the\r\nuncertain and fickle Marquise's help Gaston de Stainville was far from\r\nattaining a position such as his alliance with Lydie would literally\r\nhave thrown into his lap, such, of course, as fell to the share of the\r\namiable milor, who had succeeded in capturing the golden prey. In\r\nthese days of petticoat government feminine protection was the chief\r\nleverage for advancement; Irène, however, could do nothing for her\r\nhusband without outside help; conscious of her own powers of\r\nfascination, she had cast about for the most likely prop on which she\r\ncould lean gracefully whilst helping Gaston to climb upward.\r\n\r\nThe King himself was too deeply in the toils of his fair Jeanne to\r\nhave eyes for any one save for her. M. le Duc d'Aumont, Prime Minister\r\nof France, was his daughter's slave; there remained M. le\r\nContrôleur-Général himself--a figure-head as far as the affairs of\r\nState were concerned, but wielding a great deal of personal power\r\nthrough the vastness of his wealth which Lydie rather affected to\r\ndespise.\r\n\r\nIrène, therefore--_faute de mieux_--turned her languishing eyes upon\r\nM. le Contrôleur. Her triumph was pleasing to herself, and might in\r\ndue course prove useful to Gaston, if she succeeded presently in\r\ncounterbalancing Lydie's domineering influence over milor. For the\r\nmoment her vanity was agreeably soothed, although \"la belle brune de\r\nBordeaux\" herself was fully alive to the fact that, while her\r\nwhispered conversations at milor's _petits levers_, her sidelong\r\nglances and conscious blushes called forth enough mischievous oglings\r\nand equivocal jests from the more frivolous section of society\r\nbutterflies, Lydie only viewed her and her machinations with cold and\r\nsomewhat humiliating indifference.\r\n\r\n\"And,\" as M. d'Argenson very pertinently remarked that self-same\r\nmorning, \"would any beautiful woman care to engage the attentions of a\r\nman unless she aroused at the same time the jealousy or at least the\r\nannoyance of a rival?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE PROMISES OF FRANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed, if Irène de Stainville had possessed more penetration, or had\r\nat any rate studied Lydie's face more closely, she would never have\r\nimagined for a moment that thoughts of petty spite or of feminine\r\npique could find place in the busiest brain that ever toiled for the\r\nwelfare of France.\r\n\r\nHistory has no doubt said the last word on the subject of that brief\r\ninterregnum, when a woman's masterful hand tried to check the\r\nextravagances of a King and the ruinous caprices of a wanton, and when\r\na woman's will tried to restrain a nation in its formidable onrush\r\ndown the steep incline which led to the abyss of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nMany historians have sneered--perhaps justly so--at this apotheosis of\r\nfeminity, and pointed to the fact that, while that special era of\r\npetticoat government lasted, Louis XV in no way stopped his excesses\r\nnor did Pompadour deny herself the satisfaction of a single whim,\r\nwhilst France continued uninterruptedly to groan under the yoke of\r\noppressive taxation, of bribery and injustice, and to suffer from the\r\narrogance of her nobles and the corruption of her magistrates.\r\n\r\nThe avowed partisans of Lydie d'Eglinton contend on the other hand\r\nthat her rule lasted too short a time to be of real service to the\r\ncountry, and that those who immediately succeeded her were either too\r\nweak or too self-seeking to continue this new system of government\r\ninstituted by her, and based on loftiness of ideals and purity of\r\nmotives, a system totally unknown hitherto. They also insist on the\r\nfact that while she virtually held the reins of government over the\r\nheads of her indolent lord and her over-indulgent father, she brought\r\nabout many highly beneficent social reforms which would have become\r\nfirmly established had she remained several years in power; there is\r\nno doubt that she exercised a wholesome influence over the existing\r\nadministration of justice and the distribution of the country's money;\r\nand this in spite of endless cabals and the petty intrigues and\r\njealousies of numberless enemies.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, the present chronicler is bound to put it on record\r\nthat, at the moment when Irène de Stainville vaguely wondered whether\r\nMadame la Marquise was looking reprovingly at her, when she hoped that\r\nshe had at last succeeded in rousing the other woman's jealousy, the\r\nlatter's mind was dwelling with more than usual anxiousness on the sad\r\nevents of the past few months.\r\n\r\nHer severe expression was only the outcome of a more than normal sense\r\nof responsibility. The flattering courtiers and meddlesome women who\r\nsurrounded her seemed to Lydie this morning more than usually\r\nbrainless and vapid. Her own father, to whose integrity and keen sense\r\nof honour she always felt that she could make appeal, was unusually\r\nabsent and morose to-day; and she felt unspeakably lonely here in the\r\nmidst of her immediate _entourage_--lonely and oppressed. She wanted\r\nto mix more with the general throng, the men and women of France,\r\narrogant nobles or obsequious churls, merchants, attorneys,\r\nphysicians, savants, she cared not which; the nation, in fact, the\r\npeople who had sympathy and high ideals, and a keener sense of the\r\ndignity of France.\r\n\r\nWhile these sycophants were for ever wanting, wanting, wanting,\r\nstanding before her, as it were, with hands outstretched ready to\r\nreceive bribes, commissions, places of influence or affluence, Charles\r\nEdward Stuart, lately the guest of the nation, the friend of many,\r\nwhom France herself little more than a year ago had feasted and\r\ntoasted, to whom she had wished \"God-speed!\" was now a miserable\r\nfugitive, hiding in peasants' huts, beneath overhanging crags on the\r\ndeserted shores of Scotland, a price put upon his head, and the\r\ndevotion of a few helpless enthusiasts, a girl, an old retainer, as\r\nsole barrier 'twixt him and death.\r\n\r\nAnd France had promised that she would help him. She promised that she\r\nwould succour him if he failed, that she would not abandon him in his\r\ndistress--neither him nor his friends.\r\n\r\nAnd now disaster had come--disaster so overwhelming, so appalling,\r\nthat France at first had scarce liked to believe. Every one was so\r\nastonished; had they not thought that England, Scotland and Ireland\r\nwere clamouring for a Stuart? That the entire British nation was\r\nwanting him, waiting for him, ready to acclaim him with open arms? The\r\nfirst successes--Falkirk, Prestonpans--had surprised no one. The young\r\nPretender's expedition was bound to be nothing but a triumphal\r\nprocession through crowded streets, decorated towns and beflagged\r\nvillages, with church bells ringing, people shouting, deputations,\r\nboth civic and military, waiting hat in hand, with sheaves of loyal\r\naddresses.\r\n\r\nInstead of this, Culloden, Derby, the hasty retreat, treachery, and\r\nthe horrible reprisals. All that was common property now.\r\n\r\nFrance knew that the young prince whom she had _féted_ was perhaps at\r\nthis moment dying of want, and yet these hands which had grasped his\r\nwere not stretched out to help him, the lips which had encouraged and\r\ncheered him, which had even gently mocked his gloomy mood, still\r\nsmiled and chatted as irresponsibly as of yore, and spoke the\r\nfugitive's name at careless moments 'twixt a laugh and a jest.\r\n\r\nAnd this in spite of promises.\r\n\r\nShe had dismissed her _entourage_ with a curt nod just now, when her\r\nfather first joined her circle. At any rate, her position of splendid\r\nisolation should give her the right this morning to be alone with him,\r\nsince she so wished it. At first glance she saw that he was troubled,\r\nand her anxious eyes closely scanned his face. But he seemed\r\ndetermined not to return her scrutinizing glance, and anon, when one\r\nby one M. de Coigni, the Count de Bailleul, and others who had been\r\ntalking to Lydie, discreetly stepped aside, he seemed anxious to\r\ndetain them, eager not to be left quite alone with his daughter.\r\n\r\nSeeing his manœuvres, Lydie's every suspicion was aroused; something\r\nhad occurred to disturb her father this morning, something which he\r\ndid not intend to tell her. She drew him further back into the window\r\nembrasure and made room for him close to her on the settee. She looked\r\nup impatiently at the Dowager Lady Eglinton, who had calmly stood her\r\nground whilst the other intimates were being so summarily dismissed.\r\nMiladi appeared determined to ignore her daughter-in-law's desire to\r\nbe alone with her father, and it even seemed to Lydie as if a look of\r\nunderstanding had passed between the Duke and the old lady when first\r\nthey met.\r\n\r\nShe felt her nervous system on the jar. Thoroughly frank and open in\r\nall political dealings herself, she loathed the very hint of a secret\r\nunderstanding. Yet she trusted her father, even though she feared his\r\nweakness.\r\n\r\nShe talked of Charles Edward Stuart, for that was her chief\r\npreoccupation. She lauded him and pitied him in turn, spoke of his\r\npredicament, his flight, the devotion of his Scotch adherents, and\r\nfinally of France's promise to him.\r\n\r\n\"God grant,\" she said fervently, \"that France may not be too late in\r\ndoing her duty by that ill-starred prince.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, my dear child, it is sheer madness to think of such a thing,\"\r\nsaid the Duke, speaking in tones of gentle reproof and soothingly, as\r\nif to a wilful child.\r\n\r\n\"Hé! pardieu!\" broke in miladi's sharp, high-pitched voice: \"that is\r\nprecisely what I have been trying to explain to Lydie these past two\r\nweeks, but she will not listen and is not even to be spoken to on that\r\nsubject now. Do you scold her well, M. le Duc, for I have done my\r\nbest--and her obstinacy will lead my son into dire disgrace with His\r\nMajesty, who doth not favour her plans.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miladi is right, Lydie,\" said the Duke, \"and if I thought that your\r\nhusband----\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, my dear father!\" interrupted Lydie calmly; \"I pray you do not\r\nvent your displeasure on Lord Eglinton. As you see, Mme. la Comtesse\r\nde Stainville is doing her best to prevent his thoughts from dwelling\r\non the fate of his unfortunate friend.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the Duke's turn to scrutinize his daughter's face, vaguely\r\nwondering if she had spoken in bitterness, not altogether sorry if\r\nthis new train of thought were to divert her mind from that eternal\r\nsubject of the moribund Stuart cause, which seemed to have become an\r\nobsession with her. He half-turned in the direction where Lydie's eyes\r\nwere still fixed, and saw a patch of bright rose colour, clear and\r\nvivid against the dull hangings of M. le Contrôleur's couch, whilst\r\nthe elegant outline of a woman's stately form stood between his line\r\nof vision and the face of his son-in-law.\r\n\r\nThe Duc d'Aumont dearly loved his daughter, but he also vastly admired\r\nher intellectual power, therefore at sight of that graceful, rose-clad\r\nfigure he shrugged his shoulders in amiable contempt. Bah! Lydie was\r\nfar too clever to dwell on such foolish matters as the vapid\r\nflirtations of a brainless doll, even if the object of such\r\nflirtations was the subjugation of milor.\r\n\r\nLady Eglinton had also perceived Lydie's fixity of expression just now\r\nwhen she spoke of Irène, but whilst M. le Duc carelessly shrugged his\r\nshoulders and dismissed the matter from his mind, miladi boldly threw\r\nherself across her daughter-in-law's new trend of thought.\r\n\r\n\"My son for once shows sound common sense,\" she said decisively; \"why\r\nshould France be led into further extravagance and entangle herself,\r\nperhaps, in the meshes of a hopeless cause by----\"\r\n\r\n\"By fulfilling a solemn promise,\" interrupted Lydie quietly, whilst\r\nshe turned her earnest eyes on her mother-in-law in the manner so\r\ncharacteristic of her--\"a promise which the very hopelessness of which\r\nyou speak has rendered doubly sacred.\"\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty is not of that opinion,\" retorted the older woman\r\ntestily, \"and we must concede that he is the best judge of what France\r\nowes to her own honour.\"\r\n\r\nTo this challenge it was obviously impossible to reply in the\r\nnegative, and if Lydie's heart whispered \"Not always!\" her lips\r\ncertainly did not move.\r\n\r\nShe looked appealingly at her father; she wanted more than ever to be\r\nalone with him, to question him, to reassure herself as to certain\r\nvague suspicions which troubled her and which would not be stilled.\r\nShe longed, above all, to be rid of her mother-in-law's interfering\r\ntongue, of the platitudes, which she uttered, and which had the knack\r\nof still further jarring on Lydie's over-sensitive nerves.\r\n\r\nBut the Duke did not help her. Usually he, too, was careful to avoid\r\ndirect discussions with Lady Eglinton, whose rasping voice was wont to\r\nirritate him, but this morning he seemed disinclined to meet Lydie's\r\nappealing eyes. He fidgeted in his chair, and anon he crossed one\r\nshapely leg over the other and thoughtfully stroked his well-turned\r\ncalf.\r\n\r\n\"There are moments in diplomacy, my dear child----\" he began, after a\r\nmoment of oppressive silence.\r\n\r\n\"My dear father,\" interrupted Lydie, with grave determination, \"let me\r\ntell you once for all that over this matter my mind is fully made up.\r\nWhile I have a voice in the administration of this Kingdom of France,\r\nI will not allow her to sully her fair name by such monstrous\r\ntreachery as the abandonment of a friend who trusted in her honour and\r\nthe promises she made him.\"\r\n\r\nHer voice had shaken somewhat as she spoke. Altogether she seemed\r\nunlike herself, less sure, less obstinately dominant. That look of\r\nunderstanding between her father and Lady Eglinton had troubled her in\r\na way for which she could not account. Yet she knew that the whole\r\nmatter rested in her own hands. No one--not even His Majesty--had ever\r\nquestioned her right to deal with Treasury money. And money was all\r\nthat was needed. Though the final word nominally rested with milor, he\r\nleft her perfectly free, and she could act as she thought right,\r\nwithout let or hindrance.\r\n\r\nYet, strangely enough, she felt as if she wanted support in this\r\nmatter. It was a purely personal feeling, and one she did not care to\r\nanalyse. She had no doubt whatever as to the justice and righteousness\r\nof her desire, but in this one solitary instance of her masterful\r\nadministration she seemed to require the initiative, or at least the\r\napproval, of her father or of the King.\r\n\r\nInstead of this approval she vaguely scented intrigue.\r\n\r\nShe rose from the settee and went to the window behind it. The\r\natmosphere of the room had suddenly become stifling. Fortunately the\r\ntall casements were unlatched. They yielded to a gentle push, and\r\nLydie stepped out on to the balcony. Already the air was hot, and the\r\nsun shone glaringly on the marble fountains, and drew sparks of fire\r\nfrom the dome of the conservatories. The acrid, pungent smell of\r\ncannas and of asters rose to her nostrils, drowning the subtler aroma\r\nof tea roses and of lilies; the monotonous drip of the fountains was a\r\nsoothing contrast in her ear to the babel of voices within.\r\n\r\nAt her feet the well-sanded walks of the park stretched out like\r\nribbons of pale gold to the dim, vast distance beyond; the curly heads\r\nof Athenian athletes peeped from among the well-trimmed bosquets,\r\nshowing the immaculate whiteness of the polished marble in the sun. A\r\ncouple of gardeners clad in shirts of vivid blue linen were stooping\r\nover a bed of monthly roses, picking off dead leaves and twigs that\r\nspoilt the perfect symmetry of the shrubs, whilst two more a few\r\npaces away were perfecting the smoothness of a box hedge, lest a tiny\r\nleaflet were out of place.\r\n\r\nLydie sighed impatiently. Even in this vastness and this peace, man\r\nbrought his artificiality to curb the freedom of nature. Everything in\r\nthis magnificent park was affected, stilted and forced; every tree was\r\nfashioned to a shape not its own, every flower made to be a\r\ncounterpart of its fellow.\r\n\r\nThis sense of unreality, of fighting nature in its every aspect, was\r\nwhat had always oppressed her, even when she worked at first in\r\nperfect harmony with her father, when she still had those utopian\r\nhopes of a regenerate France, with a wise and beneficent monarch, an\r\nera of truth and of fraternity, every one toiling hand-in-hand for the\r\ngood of the nation.\r\n\r\nWhat a child she had been in those days! How little she had understood\r\nthis hydra-headed monster of self-seeking ambition, of political\r\nwire-pulling, of petty cabals and personal animosities which fought\r\nand crushed and trampled on every lofty ideal, on every clean thought\r\nand high-minded aspiration.\r\n\r\nShe knew and understood better now. She had outgrown her childish\r\nideals: those she now kept were a woman's ideals, no less pure, no\r\nless high or noble, but lacking just one great quality--that of hope.\r\nShe had continued to work and to do her best for this country which\r\nshe loved--her own beautiful France. She had--with no uncertain\r\nhand--seized the reins of government from the diffident fingers of her\r\nlord, she still strove to fight corruption, to curb excesses and to\r\ncheck arrogance, and made vain endeavours to close her eyes to the\r\nfutility of her noblest efforts.\r\n\r\nThis attitude of King Louis toward the Young Pretender had brought it\r\nall home to her; the intrigues, the lying, the falseness of\r\neverything, the treachery which lurked in every corner of this\r\nsumptuous palace, the egoism which was the sole moving power of those\r\noverdressed dolls.\r\n\r\nPerhaps for the first time since--in all the glory and pride of her\r\nyoung womanhood--she became conscious of its power over the weaker and\r\nsterner vessel, she felt a sense of discouragement, the utter\r\nhopelessness of her desires. Her heart even suggested contempt of\r\nherself, of her weak-minded foolishness in imagining that all those\r\nempty heads in the room yonder could bring forth one single serious\r\nthought from beneath their powdered perruques, one single wholly\r\nselfless aspiration for the good of France; any more than that\r\nstultified rose-tree could produce a bloom of splendid perfection or\r\nthat stunted acacia intoxicate the air with the fragrance of its\r\nbloom.\r\n\r\nSolitude had taken hold of Lydie's fancy. She had allowed her mind to\r\ngo roaming, fancy-free. Her thoughts were melancholy and anxious, and\r\nshe sighed or frowned more than once. The air was becoming hotter and\r\nhotter every moment, and a gigantic bed of scarlet geraniums sent a\r\ncurious acrid scent to her nostrils, which she found refreshing. Anon\r\nshe succeeded in shutting out from her eyes the picture of those\r\ngardeners maiming the rose-trees and bosquets, and in seeing only that\r\ndistant horizon with the vague, tiny fleecy clouds which were hurrying\r\nquite gaily and freely to some unknown destination, far, no doubt,\r\nfrom this world of craft and affectation. She shut her ears to the\r\nsound of miladi's shrill laugh and the chatter of senseless fools\r\nbehind her, and only tried to hear the rippling murmur of the water in\r\nthe fountains, the merry chirrup of the sparrows, and far, very far\r\naway, the sweet, sad note of a lark soaring upward to the serene\r\nmorning sky.\r\n\r\nThe sound of a footstep on the flag-stones of the balcony broke in on\r\nher meditations. Her father, still wearing that troubled look, was\r\ncoming out to join her. Fortunately miladi had chosen to remain\r\nindoors.\r\n\r\nImpulsively now, for her nerves were still quivering with the tension\r\nof recent introspection, she went straight up to this man whom she\r\nmost fully trusted in all the world, and took his hands in both hers.\r\n\r\n\"My dear, dear father,\" she pleaded, with her wonted earnestness, \"you\r\n_will_ help me, will you not?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked more troubled than ever at her words, almost pathetic in his\r\nobvious helplessness, as he ejaculated feebly:\r\n\r\n\"But what can we do, my dear child?\"\r\n\r\n\"Send _Le Monarque_ to meet Prince Charles Edward,\" she urged; \"it is\r\nso simple.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very hazardous, and would cost a vast amount of money. In the\r\npresent state of the Treasury----\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear father, France can afford the luxury of not selling her\r\nhonour.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the English will be furious with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"The English cannot do more than fight us, and they are doing that\r\nalready!\" she retorted.\r\n\r\n\"The risks, my dear child, the risks!\" he protested again.\r\n\r\n\"What risks, father dear?\" she said eagerly. \"Tell me, what do we risk\r\nby sending _Le Monarque_ with secret orders to the Scottish coast, to\r\na spot known to no one save to Lord Eglinton and myself, confided to\r\nmy husband by the unfortunate young Prince before he started on this\r\nmiserable expedition? Captain Barre will carry nothing that can in\r\nany way betray the secret of his destination nor the object of his\r\njourney--my husband's seal-ring on his finger, nothing more; this\r\ntoken he will take on shore himself--not even the ship's crew will\r\nknow aught that would be fatal if betrayed.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the English can intercept _Le Monarque_!\"\r\n\r\n\"We must run that risk,\" she retorted. \"Once past the coast of\r\nEngland, Scotland is lonely enough. _Le Monarque_ will meet no other\r\ncraft, and Captain Barre knows the secrets of his own calling--he has\r\nrun a cargo before now.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is childish obstinacy, Lydie, and I do not recognize the\r\nstatesman in this sentimental chit, who prates nonsense like a\r\nschoolgirl imbued with novel-reading,\" said the Duke now with marked\r\nimpatience; \"and pray, if His Majesty should put a veto on your using\r\none of his ships for this privateering expedition?\"\r\n\r\n\"I propose sending _Le Monarque_ to-morrow,\" rejoined Lydie quietly.\r\n\"Captain Barre will have his orders direct from the Ministry of\r\nFinance; and then we'll obtain His Majesty's sanction on the following\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this is madness, my child!\" exclaimed the Duke. \"You cannot\r\nopenly set at defiance the wishes of the King!\"\r\n\r\n\"The wishes of the King?\" she cried, with sudden vehemence. \"Surely,\r\nsurely, my dear, dear father, you cannot mean what you suggest! Think!\r\noh, think just for one moment! That poor young man, who was our guest,\r\nwhom we all liked--he broke bread with us in our own house, our\r\nbeautiful château de la Tour d'Aumont, which has never yet been\r\ndefiled by treachery. And you talk of leaving him there in that\r\nfar-off land which has proved so inhospitable to him? Of leaving him\r\nthere either to perish miserably of want and starvation or to fall\r\ninto the hands of that Hanoverian butcher whose name has become a\r\nby-word for unparalleled atrocities?\"\r\n\r\nShe checked herself, and then resumed more calmly:\r\n\r\n\"Nay, my dear father, I pray you let us cease this argument; for once\r\nin the history of our happy life together you and I look at honour\r\nfrom opposite points of view.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear, I see that, too,\" he rejoined, speaking now with some\r\nhesitation. \"I wish I could persuade you to abandon the idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"To abandon the unfortunate young Prince, you mean, to break every\r\npromise we ever made to him--to become the by-word in our turn for\r\ntreachery and cowardice in every country in Europe--and why?\" she\r\nadded, with helpless impatience, trying to understand, dreading almost\r\nto question. \"Why? Why?\"\r\n\r\nThen, as her father remained silent, with eyes persistently fixed on\r\nsome vague object in the remote distance, she said, as if acting on a\r\nsudden decisive thought:\r\n\r\n\"Father, dear, is it solely a question of cost?\"\r\n\r\n\"Partly,\" he replied, with marked hesitation.\r\n\r\n\"Partly? Well, then, dear, we will remove one cause of your\r\nunexplainable opposition. You may assure His Majesty in my name that\r\nthe voyage of _Le Monarque_ shall cost the Treasury nothing.\"\r\n\r\nThen as her father made no comment, she continued more eagerly:\r\n\r\n\"Lord Eglinton will not deny me, as you know; he is rich and Charles\r\nEdward Stuart is his friend. What _Le Monarque_ has cost for\r\nprovisioning, that we will immediately replace. For the moment we\r\nwill borrow this ship from His Majesty's navy. _That_ he _cannot_\r\nrefuse! and I give you and His Majesty my word of honour that _Le\r\nMonarque_ shall not cost the Treasury one single sou--even the pay of\r\nher crew shall be defrayed by us from the moment that she sails out of\r\nLe Havre until the happy moment when she returns home with Prince\r\nCharles Edward Stuart and his friends safe and sound aboard.\"\r\n\r\nThere was silence between them for awhile. The Duc d'Aumont's eyes\r\nwere fixed steadily on a distant point on the horizon, but Lydie's\r\neyes never for a second strayed away from her father's face.\r\n\r\n\"Will _Le Monarque_ have a long journey to make?\" asked the Duke\r\nlightly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"To the coast of Scotland?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The west coast, of course?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should you ask, dear?\"\r\n\r\nShe asked him this question quite casually, then, as he did not reply,\r\nshe asked it again, this time with a terrible tightening of her\r\nheart-strings. Suddenly she remembered her suspicions, when first she\r\ncaught the glance of intelligence which passed swiftly from him to\r\nmiladi.\r\n\r\nWith a quick gesture of intense agitation she placed a hand on his\r\nwrist.\r\n\r\n\"Father!\" she said in a scarce audible murmur.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear. What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I--I have been much troubled of late. I do not think\r\nthat my perceptions are perhaps as keen as they were--and as you say,\r\nthis matter of the Stuart Prince has weighed heavily on my mind.\r\nTherefore, will you forgive me, dear, if--if I ask you a question\r\nwhich may sound undutiful, disloyal to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I will forgive you, dear,\" he said, after a slight moment\r\nof hesitation. \"What is it?\"\r\n\r\nHe had pulled himself together, and now met his daughter's glance with\r\nsufficient firmness, apparently to reassure her somewhat, for she said\r\nmore quietly:\r\n\r\n\"Will you give me your word of honour that you personally know of no\r\nact of treachery which may be in contemplation against the man who\r\ntrusts in the honour of France?\"\r\n\r\nHer glowing eyes rested upon his; they seemed desirous of penetrating\r\nto the innermost recesses of his soul. M. le Duc d'Aumont tried to\r\nbear the scrutiny without flinching but he was no great actor, nor was\r\nhe in the main a dishonourable man, but he thought his daughter unduly\r\nchivalrous, and he held that political considerations were outside the\r\nordinary standards of honour and morality.\r\n\r\nAnyway he could not bring himself to give her a definite reply; her\r\nhand still grasped his wrist--he took it in his own and raised it to\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\n\"My father!\" she pleaded, her voice trembling, her eyes still fixed\r\nupon him, \"will you not answer my question?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is answered, my dear,\" he replied evasively. \"Do you think it\r\nworthy of me--your father--to protest mine honesty before my own\r\nchild?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him no longer, and gently withdrew her hand from his\r\ngrasp. She understood that, indeed, he had answered her question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE WEIGHT OF ETIQUETTE\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps certain characteristics which milor the Marquis of Eglinton\r\nhad inherited from his English grandfather caused him to assume a more\r\nelaborate costume for his _petit lever_ than the rigid court etiquette\r\nof the time had prescribed.\r\n\r\nAccording to every mandate of usage and fashion, when, at exactly\r\nhalf-past ten o'clock, he had asked M. Achille so peremptorily for his\r\nshoes and then sat on the edge of his bed, with legs dangling over its\r\nsides, he should have been attired in a flowered dressing gown over a\r\nlace-ruffled _chemise de nuit_, and a high-peaked _bonnet-de-coton_\r\nwith the regulation tassel should have taken the place of the still\r\nabsent perruque.\r\n\r\nThen all the distinguished gentlemen who stood nearest to him would\r\nhave known what to do. They had all attended _petits levers_ of kings,\r\ncourtisanes, and Ministers, ever since their rank and dignities\r\nentitled them so to do. Mme. la Comtesse de Stainville, for instance,\r\nwould have stepped aside at this precise juncture with a deep curtsey\r\nand mayhap a giggle or a smirk--since she was privileged to be\r\nfrivolous--whereupon M. Achille would with the proper decorum due to\r\nso solemn a function have handed M. le Contrôleur's day shirt to the\r\nvisitor of highest rank there present, who was privileged to pass it\r\nover milor's head.\r\n\r\nThat important formality accomplished, the great man's toilet could be\r\ncompleted by _M. le valet-de-chambre_ himself. But who had ever heard\r\nof a Minister's _petit-lever_ being brought to a close without the\r\nceremony of his being helped on with his shirt by a prince of the\r\nblood, or at least a marshal of France?\r\n\r\nHowever, _le petit Anglais_ had apparently some funny notions of his\r\nown--heirlooms, no doubt, from that fog-ridden land beyond the seas,\r\nthe home of his ancestors--and vainly had Monsieur Achille, that\r\nparagon among flunkeys, tried to persuade his Marquis not to set the\r\nhitherto inviolate etiquette of the Court of France quite so\r\nflagrantly at defiance.\r\n\r\nAll his efforts had been in vain.\r\n\r\nMonsieur d'Argenson, who was present on this 13th of August, 1746,\r\ntells us that when milor did call for his shoes at least ten minutes\r\ntoo soon, and was thereupon tenderly reproached by Madame la Comtesse\r\nde Stainville for this ungallant haste, he was already more than half\r\ndressed.\r\n\r\nTrue, the flowered _robe-de-chambre_ was there--and vastly becoming,\r\ntoo, with its braided motifs and downy lining of a contrasting\r\nhue--but when milor threw off the coverlet with a boyish gesture of\r\nimpatience, he appeared clad in a daintily frilled day-shirt, breeches\r\nof fine faced cloth, whilst a pair of white silk stockings covered his\r\nwell-shaped calves.\r\n\r\nTrue, the perruque was still absent, but so was the regulation cotton\r\nnight-cap; instead of these, milor, with that eccentricity peculiar to\r\nthe entire British race, wore his own hair slightly powdered and tied\r\nat the nape of the neck with a wide black silk bow.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Achille looked extremely perturbed, and, had his rigorous\r\nfeatures ventured to show any expression at all, they would\r\nundoubtedly have displayed one of respectful apology to all the\r\nhigh-born gentlemen who witnessed this unedifying spectacle. As it\r\nwas, the face of _Monsieur le valet-de-chambre_ was set in marble-like\r\nrigidity; perhaps only the slightest suspicion of a sigh escaped his\r\nlips as he noted milor's complete unconsciousness of the enormity of\r\nhis offense.\r\n\r\nMonsieur le Contrôleur had been in the very midst of an animated\r\nargument with Madame de Stainville anent the respective merits of rose\r\nred and turquoise blue as a foil to a mellow complexion. This argument\r\nhe had broken off abruptly by calling for his shoes. No wonder Irène\r\npouted, her pout being singularly becoming.\r\n\r\n\"Had I been fortunate enough in pleasing your lordship with my poor\r\nwit,\" she said, \"you had not been in so great a hurry to rid yourself\r\nof my company.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, madame, permit me to explain,\" he protested gently. \"I pray you\r\ntry and remember that for the last half-hour I have been the happy yet\r\nfeeble target for the shafts aimed at me by your beauty and your wit.\r\nNow I always feel singularly helpless without my waistcoat and my\r\nshoes. I feel like a miserable combatant who, when brought face to\r\nface with a powerful enemy, hath been prevented from arming himself\r\nfor the fray.\"\r\n\r\n\"But etiquette----\" she protested.\r\n\r\n\"Etiquette is a jade, madame,\" he retorted; \"shall not you and I turn\r\nour backs on her?\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime M. Achille had, with becoming reverence, taken M. le\r\nContrôleur's coat and waistcoat in his august hands, and stood there\r\nholding them with just that awed expression of countenance which a\r\nvillage curé would wear when handling a reliquary.\r\n\r\nWith that same disregard for ceremony which had characterized him all\r\nalong, Lord Eglinton rescued his waistcoat from those insistent hands,\r\nand, heedless of Achille's look of horror, he slipped it on and\r\nbuttoned it himself with quick, dexterous fingers, as if he had never\r\ndone anything else in all his life.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Achille was speechless. For the first time perhaps in the\r\nhistory of France a Minister of Finance had put his waistcoat on\r\nhimself, and this under his--Achille's--administration. The very\r\nfoundations of his belief were tottering before his eyes; desperately\r\nnow he clung to the coat, ready to fight for its possession and shed\r\nhis blood if need be for the upkeep of the ancient traditions of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\n\"Will milor take his coat from the hands of Monseigneur le Prince de\r\nCourtenai--prince of the blood?\" he asked, with a final supreme effort\r\nfor the reëstablishment of those traditions, which were being so\r\nwantonly flouted.\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty will be here directly,\" interposed Irène hastily.\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty never comes later than half-past ten,\" protested milor\r\nfeebly, \"and he has not the vaguest idea how to help a man on with his\r\ncoat. He has had no experience and I feel that mine would become a\r\nheap of crumpled misery if his gracious hands were to insinuate it\r\nover my unworthy shoulders.\"\r\n\r\nHe made a desperate effort to gain possession of his coat, but this\r\ntime M. Achille was obdurate. It seemed as if he would not yield that\r\ncoat to any one save at the cost of his own life.\r\n\r\n\"Then it is the privilege of Monseigneur le Prince de Courtenai,\" he\r\nsaid firmly.\r\n\r\n\"But M. de Courtenai has gone to flirt with my wife!\" ejaculated Lord\r\nEglinton in despair.\r\n\r\n\"In that case no doubt M. le Duc de Luxembourg will claim the\r\nright----\"\r\n\r\n\"_Mais comment donc?_\" said the Duke with great alacrity, as, in spite\r\nof milor's still continued feeble protests, he took the coat from the\r\nhands of M. Achille.\r\n\r\nM. de Luxembourg was very pompous and very slow, and there was nothing\r\nthat Lord Eglinton hated worse than what he called amateur valeting.\r\nBut now there was nothing for it but forbearance and resignation;\r\npatience, too, of which _le petit Anglais_ had no more than a just\r\nshare. He gathered the frills of his shirt sleeves in his hands and\r\ntried not to look as if he wished M. de Luxembourg at the bottom of\r\nthe nearest pond; but at this very moment Monseigneur le Prince de\r\nCourtenai, who, it appeared, had not gone to flirt with Madame la\r\nMarquise, since the latter was very much engaged elsewhere, but had\r\nmerely been absorbed in political discussions with M. de Vermandois,\r\nsuddenly realized that one of his numerous privileges was being\r\nencroached upon.\r\n\r\nNot that he had any special desire to help M. le Contrôleur-Général on\r\nwith his coat, but because he was ever anxious that his proper\r\nprecedence as quasi prince of the blood should always be fully\r\nrecognized. So he gave a discreet cough just sufficiently loud to\r\nattract M. Achille's notice, and to warn M. le Duc de Luxembourg that\r\nhe was being presumptuous.\r\n\r\nWithout another word the coat was transferred from the hands of the\r\nMaréchal to those of the quasi-royal Prince, whilst Eglinton, wearing\r\nan air of resigned martyrdom, still waited for his coat, the frills of\r\nhis shirt sleeves gripped tightly in his hands.\r\n\r\nMonseigneur advanced. His movements were always sedate, and he felt\r\npleased that every one who stood close by had noticed that the rank\r\nand precedence, which were rightfully his, had been duly accorded him,\r\neven in so small a matter, by no less a personage than M. le\r\nContrôleur-Général des Finances.\r\n\r\nHe now held the coat in perfect position, and Lord Eglinton gave a\r\nsigh of relief, when suddenly the great doors at the end of the long\r\nroom were thrown wide open, and the stentorian voices of the royal\r\nflunkeys announced:\r\n\r\n\"Messieurs, Mesdames! His Majesty the King!\"\r\n\r\nThe buzz of talk died down, giving place to respectful murmurs. There\r\nwas a great rustle of silks and brocades, a clink of dress swords\r\nagainst the parquet floor, as the crowd parted to make way for Louis\r\nXV. The various groups of political disputants broke up, as if\r\nscattered by a fairy wand; soon all the butterflies that had hovered\r\nin the further corners of the room fluttered toward the magic centre.\r\n\r\nHere an avenue seemed suddenly to form itself of silken gowns, of\r\nbrocaded panniers, of gaily embroidered coats, topped by rows of\r\npowdered perruques that bent very low to the ground as, fat, smiling,\r\npompous, and not a little bored, His Majesty King Louis XV made slow\r\nprogress along the full length of the room, leaning lightly on the\r\narm of the inevitable Marquise de Pompadour, and nodding with great\r\ncondescension to the perruqued heads as he passed.\r\n\r\nNear the window embrasure he met la Marquise d'Eglinton and M. le Duc\r\nd'Aumont, her father. To Lydie he extended a gracious hand, and\r\nengaged her in conversation with a few trivial words. This gave Mme.\r\nde Pompadour the opportunity of darting a quick glance, that implied\r\nan anxious query, at the Duc d'Aumont, to which he responded with an\r\nalmost imperceptible shake of the head.\r\n\r\nAll the while M. le Contrôleur-Général des Finances was still\r\nstanding, shirt frills in hand, his face a picture of resigned\r\ndespair, his eyes longingly fixed on his own coat, which Monseigneur\r\nde Courtenai no longer held up for him.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Monseigneur, a rigid stickler for etiquette himself, would\r\nnever so far have forgotten what was due to the house of Bourbon as to\r\nindulge in any pursuit--such as helping a Minister on with his\r\ncoat--at the moment when His Majesty entered a room.\r\n\r\nHe bowed with the rest of them, and thus Louis XV at the end of his\r\nprogress, found the group around milor's bedside; his cousin de\r\nCourtenai bowing, Monsieur Achille with his nose almost touching his\r\nknees, and milor Eglinton in shirt sleeves looking supremely\r\nuncomfortable, and not a little sheepish.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! ce cher milor!\" said the King with charming bonhomie, as he took\r\nthe situation in at a glance. \"Nay, cousin, I claim an ancient\r\nprivilege! Monsieur le Contrôleur-Général, have you ever been waited\r\non by a King of France?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never to my knowledge, Sire,\" stammered _le petit Anglais_.\r\n\r\nLouis XV was quite delightful to-day; so fresh and boyish in his\r\nmovements, and with an inimitable _laisser aller_ and friendliness in\r\nhis manner which caused many pairs of eyes to stare, and many hearts\r\nto ponder.\r\n\r\n\"Let this be an epoch-making experience in your life, then,\" he said\r\ngaily. \"Is this your coat?\"\r\n\r\nAnd without more ado he took that much-travelled garment from\r\nMonseigneur de Courtenai's hands.\r\n\r\nSuch condescension, such easy graciousness had not been witnessed for\r\nyears! And His Majesty was not overfond of that State-appointed\r\nMinistry of Finance of which milor was the nominal head.\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty must be sorely in need of money!\" was a whispered comment\r\nwhich ran freely enough round the room.\r\n\r\nWithal the King himself seemed quite unconscious of the wave of\r\ninterest to which his gracious behaviour was giving rise. He was\r\nholding up the coat, smiling benevolently at M. le Contrôleur, who\r\nappeared to be more than usually nervous, and now made no movement\r\ntoward that much-desired portion of his attire.\r\n\r\n\"Allons, milor, I am waiting,\" said King Louis at last.\r\n\r\n\"Er--that is,\" murmured Lord Eglinton pitiably, \"could I have my coat\r\nright side out?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Ohé! par ma foi!_\" quoth the King with easy familiarity, \"your\r\npardon, milor, but 'tis seldom I hold such an article in my hands, and\r\nI believe, by all the saints in the calendar, that I was holding it\r\nupside down, wrong side out, sleeves foremost, and collar awry!\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed till his fat sides ached, and tears streamed from his eyes;\r\nthen, amidst discreet murmurs of admiration at so much condescension,\r\nsuch gracious good humour, the ceremony of putting on M. le\r\nContrôleur's coat was at last performed by the King of France, and\r\nmilor, now fully clothed and apparently much relieved in his mind, was\r\nable to present his respects to Madame de Pompadour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nROYAL FAVOURS\r\n\r\n\r\nApparently there was to be no end to royal graciousness this morning,\r\nas every one who looked could see. Hardly was the coat on M. le\r\nContrôleur's shoulders than the King engaged him in conversation,\r\nwhilst Mme. de Pompadour dropped into the armchair lately vacated by\r\nMonseigneur de Courtenai. The well-drilled circle of courtiers and\r\nladies, including la belle Irène herself, retired discreetly. Once\r\nmore there was a barrier of emptiness and parquet flooring round the\r\ninner group, now composed of His Majesty, of M. le Contrôleur-Général,\r\nand of Mme. de Pompadour. Into these sacred precincts no one would\r\nhave dared to step. Lydie, having paid her respects to His Majesty,\r\nhad not joined that intimate circle, and it seemed as if Louis XV had\r\nnoted her absence, and was duly relieved thereat.\r\n\r\nAnon M. le Duc d'Aumont approached the King, offering him a chair.\r\nLouis took it, and in the act of so doing he contrived to whisper four\r\nquick words in his Prime Minister's ear.\r\n\r\n\"Eh bien! Your daughter?\"\r\n\r\nLord Eglinton just then was busy trying to find a suitable place\r\nwhereon to deposit his own insignificant person, and blushing\r\nviolently because Mme. de Pompadour had laughingly waved her fan in\r\nthe direction of his monumental bed; M. le Duc, therefore, whilst\r\nadjusting a cushion behind the King's back, was able to reply\r\nhurriedly:\r\n\r\n\"Impossible, Sire!\"\r\n\r\n\"And l'Anglais?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not yet tried.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! ah! ah!\" laughed Pompadour merrily. \"M. le Contrôleur-Général des\r\nFinances, are all Englishmen as modest as you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I don't know, Madame. I don't know very many,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Here is M. le Contrôleur too bashful to sit on the edge of his own\r\nbed in my presence,\" she continued, still laughing. \"Nay, milor, I'll\r\nwager that you were reclining on those downy cushions when you were\r\nflirting with Mme. de Stainville.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only under the compulsion of my valet-de-chambre, Madame,\" he\r\nprotested, \"or I'd have got up hours ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he such a tyrant, then?\" asked Louis.\r\n\r\n\"Terrible, your Majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are afraid of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I tremble at his look.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! it is well M. le Contrôleur-Général des Finances should tremble\r\nsometimes, even if only before his valet-de-chambre,\" sighed Louis XV\r\nwith comic pathos.\r\n\r\n\"But, Sire, I tremble very often!\" protested Lord Eglinton.\r\n\r\n\"I' faith he speaks truly,\" laughed Mme. de Pompadour, \"since he\r\ntrembles before his wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we tremble before M. le Contrôleur,\" concluded the King gaily.\r\n\r\n\"Before me, Sire?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, indeed, since our Parliaments have made you our dragon.\"\r\n\r\n\"A good-tempered, meek sort of dragon, Sire, you'll graciously admit.\"\r\n\r\n\"That we will, milor, and gladly!\" said Louis XV, now with somewhat\r\ntoo exuberant good-humour; \"and you'll not have cause to regret that\r\nmeekness, for your King hath remained your friend.\"\r\n\r\nThen, as Lord Eglinton seemed either too much overcome by the amazing\r\ncondescension, or too bashful to respond, his Majesty continued more\r\nsedately:\r\n\r\n\"We are about to prove our friendship, milor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty--finds me--er--quite unprepared--er----\" stammered\r\nmilor, who in verity appeared distinctly confused, for his eyes roamed\r\nround the room as if in search of help or support in this interesting\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n\"Nay! nay!\" rejoined the King benignly, \"this we understand, milor. It\r\nis not often the King of France chooses a friend amongst his subjects.\r\nFor we look upon you as our subject now, M. le Contrôleur, since we\r\nhave accepted your oath of allegiance. You have only just enough\r\nEnglish blood left in your veins to make you doubly loyal and true to\r\nyour King. Nay! nay! no thanks--we speak as our royal heart moves us.\r\nJust now we spoke of proofs of our friendship. Milor, tell us frankly,\r\nare you so very rich?\"\r\n\r\nThe question came so abruptly at the end of the sentimental peroration\r\nthat Lord Eglinton was completely thrown off his balance. He was not\r\nused to private and intimate conversations with King Louis; his wife\r\nsaw to all affairs of State, and the present emergency found him\r\nunprepared.\r\n\r\n\"I--I believe so, Sire,\" he stammered.\r\n\r\n\"But surely not _so_ rich,\" insisted the King, \"that a million or so\r\nlivres would come amiss? Hé!\"?\r\n\r\n\"I don't rightly know, Sire; it a little depends.\"\r\n\r\n\"On what?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the provenance of the million.\"\r\n\r\n\"More than one, good milor--two, mayhap,\" said the King exultantly.\r\n\r\nThen he drew his chair in somewhat closer. Lord Eglinton had taken\r\nMme. de Pompadour's advice and was sitting on the edge of the bed. We\r\nmay presume that that edge was very hard and uncomfortable, for milor\r\nfidgeted and looked supremely unhappy. Anon the King's knees were\r\nclose to his own, and Madame's brocaded skirt got entangled with his\r\nfeet. The buzz of talk in the large room drowned the King's whispers\r\neffectually, the wide barrier of empty floor was an effectual check on\r\neavesdropping. Obviously no one would hear what Louis was about to\r\nconfide to his Minister; he leaned forward and dropped his voice so\r\nthat Eglinton himself could scarcely hear, and had to bend his head so\r\nthat he got Louis's hot, excited breath full on the cheek. Being\r\nGeneral Comptroller of Finance and receiving the confidences of a King\r\nhad its drawbacks at times.\r\n\r\n\"Milor,\" whispered his Majesty, \"'tis a good affair we would propose,\r\none which we could carry through without your help, but in which we\r\nwould wish to initiate you, seeing that you are our friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"I listen, Sire.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Duke of Cumberland--you know him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has quelled the rebellion and humbled the standard of that\r\narrogant Stuart Pretender.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty's friend--yes,\" said Eglinton innocently.\r\n\r\n\"Bah! our friend!\" and Louis XV shrugged his shoulders, whilst Mme. de\r\nPompadour gave a short contemptuous laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I am sorry! I thought----\" said milor gently. \"I pray your\r\nMajesty to continue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Charles Edward Stuart was no friend to us, milor,\" resumed Louis\r\ndecisively: \"observe, I pray you, the trouble which he hath brought\r\nabout our ears. We had had peace with England ere now, but for that\r\naccursed adventurer and his pretensions; and now that he has come to\r\ndisaster and ruin----\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" said Eglinton, with a little sigh of sympathy. \"It is\r\nindeed awkward for your Majesty; the solemn promise you gave him----\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah, man! prate not to me of promises,\" interrupted Louis irritably.\r\n\"I promised him nothing; he knows that well enough--the young fool!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not let us think of him, Sire; it seems to upset your Majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does, milor, it does; for even my worst enemies concede that Louis\r\nthe Well-beloved is a creature of sympathy.\"\r\n\r\n\"A heart of gold, Sire--a heart of gold--er--shall we join the\r\nladies?\"\r\n\r\n\"Milor,\" said the King abruptly, putting a firm hand on Eglinton's\r\nwrist, \"we must not allow that young fool to thwart the external\r\npolitics of France any longer. The Duke of Cumberland, though our own\r\nenemy on the field of battle, has shown that England trusts in our\r\nhonour and loyalty even in the midst of war, but she wants a proof\r\nfrom us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, let us give it, Sire, by all means. Prince Charles Edward\r\nStuart----\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly, milor,\" said Louis XV quietly; \"that is the proof which\r\nEngland wants.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid I don't quite understand,\" said Lord Eglinton, a little\r\nbewildered. \"You see, I am very stupid; and--and perhaps my wife----\"\r\n\r\nThen, as King Louis gave a sharp ejaculation of impatience, Mme. de\r\nPompadour broke in, in tones which she knew how to render velvety and\r\nsoothing to the ear, whilst her delicate fingers rested lightly on M.\r\nle Contrôleur's hand.\r\n\r\n\"It is quite simple, milor,\" she whispered just as confidentially as\r\nthe King had done. \"This Charles Edward Stuart is a perpetual worry to\r\nEngland. His Grace, the Duke of Cumberland has been accused of\r\nunnecessary cruelty because he has been forced to take severe measures\r\nfor the suppression of that spirit of rebellion, which is only being\r\nfostered in Scotland because of that young Pretender's perpetual\r\npresence there. He fans smouldering revolt into flame, he incites\r\npassions, and creates misguided enthusiasms which lead to endless\r\ntrouble to all!\"\r\n\r\nThen as she paused, somewhat breathless and eager, her bright\r\nmyosotis-coloured eyes anxiously scanning his face he said mildly:\r\n\r\n\"How beautifully you put things, Mme. la Marquise. I vow I have never\r\nheard such a perfect flood of eloquence.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis not a matter of Madame's eloquence,\" interposed Louis, with\r\nimpatience, \"though she hath grasped the subject with marvellous\r\nclearness of judgment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then 'tis a matter of what, Sire?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Duke of Cumberland has appealed to our loyalty. Though we are at\r\nwar with England we bear no animus toward her reigning house, and have\r\nno wish to see King George's crown snatched from him by that beardless\r\nyoung adventurer, who has no more right to the throne of England than\r\nyou, milor, to that of France.\"\r\n\r\n\"And his Grace of Cumberland has asked his Majesty's help,\" added Mme.\r\nde Pompadour.\r\n\r\n\"How strange! Just as Prince Charles Edward himself hath done.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Duke of Cumberland desires the person of the Pretender,\" she\r\nsaid, without heeding the interruption, \"so that he may no longer\r\nincite misguided enthusiasts to rebellion, and cease to plunge\r\nScotland and England into the throes of civil war.\"\r\n\r\n\"His Grace asks but little, methinks!\" said Lord Eglinton slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, England is always ready to pay for what she wants,\" said the\r\nMarquise.\r\n\r\n\"And on this occasion?\" asked milor mildly.\r\n\r\n\"His Grace hath offered us, as man to man, fifteen millions livres for\r\nthe person of the Pretender,\" said the King, with sudden decision, and\r\nlooking M. le Contrôleur straight in the face.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! as man to man?\"\r\n\r\nLouis XV and Mme. la Marquise de Pompadour both drew a quick sigh of\r\nrelief. M. le Contrôleur had taken the proposal with perfect quietude.\r\nHe had not seemed startled, and his kindly face expressed nothing but\r\ngentle amazement, very natural under the circumstances, whilst his\r\nvoice--even and placid as usual--was not above a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"As man to man,\" he repeated, and nodded his head several times, as if\r\npondering over the meaning of this phrase.\r\n\r\nHow extremely fortunate! Milor had raised no objection! What a pity to\r\nhave wasted quite so much thought, anxiety, and a wealth of eloquence\r\nover a matter which was so easily disposed of! Jeanne de Pompadour\r\ngave her royal patron an encouraging nod.\r\n\r\nThere was a world of wisdom in that nod and in the look which\r\naccompanied it. \"He takes it so easily,\" that look seemed to say; \"he\r\nthinks it quite natural. We must have his help, since we do not know\r\nwhere the fugitive Prince is in hiding. This little milor alone can\r\ntell us that, and give us a token by which Charles Edward would\r\ntrustingly fall into the little ambush which we have prepared for him.\r\nBut he thinks the affair quite simple. We need not offer him quite so\r\nlarge a share in the pleasant millions as we originally had intended.\"\r\n\r\nAll this and more Mme. de Pompadour's nod conveyed to the mind of\r\nLouis the Well-beloved, and he too nodded in response before he\r\ncontinued, speaking now more casually, in a calmer, more business-like\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis a fair offer,\" he said at last; \"though the affair will not be\r\nquite so easy to conduct as his Grace supposes. He suggests our\r\nsending a ship to the coast of Scotland to meet the young adventurer\r\nand his friends, take them on board and convey them to an English\r\nport, where they will be handed over to the proper authorities. 'Tis\r\nfairly simple, methinks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Remarkably simple, your Majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, we need a little help from you, milor. Oh, nothing\r\nmuch--advice as to the spot where our good ship will be most like to\r\nfind Charles Edward Stuart--a token which if shown to that young\r\nfirebrand will induce him to trust its bearer, and come on board\r\nhimself with at least some of his friends. You follow me, milor?\"\r\n\r\nThe question seemed necessary, for Lord Eglinton's face wore such a\r\nlook of indifference as to astonish even the King, who had been\r\nprepared for some measure of protest, at any rate from this man who\r\nwas being asked to betray his friend. Although Louis was at this\r\nperiod of his life quite deaf to every call of honour and loyalty\r\nthrough that constant, ever-present and exasperating want of money for\r\nthe satisfaction of his extravagant caprices, nevertheless, there was\r\nBourbon blood in him, and this cried out loudly now, that he was\r\nsuggesting--nay, more, contemplating--a deed which would have put any\r\nof his subjects to shame, and which would have caused some of his most\r\nunscrupulous ancestors in mediæval times to writhe with humiliation in\r\ntheir graves. Therefore he had expected loud protest from Lord\r\nEglinton, arguments more or less easy to combat, indignation of\r\ncourse; but this ready acceptance of this ignoble bargain--so strange\r\nis human nature!--for the moment quite horrified Louis. Milor took the\r\nselling of his friend as calmly as he would that of a horse.\r\n\r\n\"You follow me, milor?\" reiterated the King.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, Sire,\" replied Eglinton readily enough. \"I follow you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You understand the service we ask of you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, I understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"For these services, milor, you shall be amply rewarded. We would\r\ndeem one million livres a fair amount to fall to your share.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty is generous,\" said Eglinton quite passively.\r\n\r\n\"We are just, milor,\" said the King, with a sigh of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nM. le Contrôleur seemed satisfied, and there was little else to say.\r\nLouis XV began to regret that he had offered him quite so much.\r\nApparently five hundred thousand would have been enough.\r\n\r\n\"Then we'll call that settled,\" concluded his Majesty, pushing back\r\nhis chair preparatory to ending this conversation, which he had so\r\ndreaded and which had turned out so highly satisfactory. Pity about\r\nthat million livres, of course! five hundred thousand might have done,\r\ncertainly seven! Nathless, M. le Contrôleur's private fortune was not\r\nso large as popular rumour had it, or did Mme. Lydie actually hold the\r\npurse strings?\r\n\r\n\"_C'est entendu_, milor,\" repeated Louis once more. \"We will see to\r\ncommissioning the ship and to her secret orders. As you see, there is\r\nno risk--and we shall be glad to be in the good graces of M. le Duc de\r\nCumberland. To oblige an enemy, eh, milor? an act of peace and\r\ngood-will in the midst of war. Chivalry, what?--worthy of our ancestor\r\nHenri of Navarre! Methinks it will make history.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so, too, Sire,\" said Eglinton, with obvious conviction.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! then we'll see to the completion of the affair; we--the King and\r\nM. le Duc d'Aumont. You are lucky, milor, your share of the work is so\r\nsimple; as soon as the ship is ready to sail we'll call on you for the\r\nnecessary instructions. Par ma foi! 'tis a fine business for us all,\r\nmilor; one million in your pocket for a word and a token, the residue\r\nof the fifteen millions in our royal coffers, and the thanks of his\r\nGrace of Cumberland to boot, not to mention the moral satisfaction of\r\nhaving helped to quell an unpleasant rebellion, and of placing one's\r\nenemy under lasting obligation. All for the good of France!\"\r\n\r\nLouis the Well-beloved had risen; he was more than contented; an\r\nunctuous smile, a beaming graciousness of expression pervaded his\r\nentire countenance. He groped in the wide pocket of his coat, bringing\r\nforth a letter which bore a large red seal.\r\n\r\n\"His Grace's letter, milor,\" he said with final supreme condescension,\r\nand holding the document out to M. le Contrôleur, who took it without\r\na word. \"Do you glance through it, and see that we have not been\r\nmistaken, that the whole thing is clear, straightforward and----\"\r\n\r\n\"And a damned, accursed, dirty piece of business, Sire!\"\r\n\r\nIt was undoubtedly Lord Eglinton who had spoken, for his right hand,\r\nas if in response to his thoughts, was even now crushing the paper\r\nwhich it held, whilst the left was raised preparatory to tearing the\r\ninfamous proposal to pieces. Yes, it had been milor's even, gentle\r\nvoice which had uttered this sudden decisive condemnation in the same\r\nimpassive tones, and still scarce audible even to these two people\r\nnear him, without passion, without tremor, seemingly without emotion.\r\nJust a statement of an undisputable fact, a personal opinion in answer\r\nto a question put to him.\r\n\r\nLouis, completely thrown off his balance, stared at milor as if he had\r\nbeen suddenly shaken out of a dream; for the moment he thought that\r\nhis ears must have played him a trick, that he must have misunderstood\r\nthe words so calmly uttered; instinctively his hand sought the\r\nsupport of the chair which he had just vacated. It seemed as if he\r\nneeded a solid, a materialistic prop, else his body would have reeled\r\nas his brain was doing now. Mme. de Pompadour, too, had jumped to her\r\nfeet, pushing her chair away with an angry, impatient movement. The\r\ndisappointment was so keen and sudden, coming just at the moment when\r\ntriumph seemed so complete. But whilst Louis stared somewhat blankly,\r\nat M. le Contrôleur, she, the woman, flashed rage, contempt, vengeance\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nHe had tricked and fooled her, her as well as the King, leading them\r\non to believe that he approved, the better to laugh at them both in\r\nhis sleeve.\r\n\r\nThe contemptible, arrogant wretch!\r\n\r\nHe was still half sitting, half leaning against the edge of his bed,\r\nand staring straight out before him through the big bay window which\r\ngave on to the park, passively, gently, as if the matter had ceased to\r\nconcern him, as if he were quite unconscious of the enormity of his\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\"A--a damned--what?--accursed!--what?----\" stammered the King; \"but,\r\nmilor----\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, Sire, I pray you!\" broke in a grave voice suddenly; \"my lord\r\nseems to have angered your Majesty. Will you deign to explain?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nDIPLOMACY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe buzz of talk was going on as loudly and incessantly as before. The\r\nwhispered conversation around M. le Contrôleur's bedside had excited\r\nno violent curiosity. The first surprise occasioned by His Majesty's\r\nunparalleled condescension soon gave way to indifference; it was\r\nobvious that the King's assiduity beside the Minister of Finance was\r\nsolely due to a more than normal desire for money, and these royal\r\ndemands for renewed funds were too numerous to cause more than passing\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nEavesdropping was impossible without gross disrespect, the latter far\r\nmore unpardonable than the most insatiable curiosity. Lydie alone,\r\nprivileged above all, had apparently not heeded the barrier which\r\nisolated Louis XV, Pompadour and milor from the rest of the vast\r\napartment, for she now stood at the foot of the bed--a graceful,\r\nimposing figure dressed in somewhat conventual gray, with one hand\r\nresting on the delicate panelling, her grave, luminous eyes fixed on\r\nthe King's face.\r\n\r\nLouis shook himself free from the stupor in which milor's unexpected\r\nwords had plunged him. Surprise yielded now to vexation. Lydie's\r\nappearance, her interference in this matter, would be the final\r\ndeath-blow to his hopes. Those tantalizing millions had dangled close\r\nbefore his eyes, his royal hands had almost grasped them, his ears\r\nheard their delicious clink; milor's original attitude had brought\r\nthem seemingly within his grasp. Now everything was changed. The whole\r\naffair would have to be argued out again at full length, and though\r\n_le petit Anglais_ might prove amenable, Mme. Lydie was sure to be\r\nobdurate.\r\n\r\nLouis XV scowled at the picture of youth and beauty presented by that\r\nelegant figure in dove-gray silk, with the proud head carried high,\r\nthe unconscious look of power and of strength in the large gray eyes,\r\nso grave and so fixed. In his mind there had already flashed the\r\nthought that milor's sudden change of attitude--for it was a change,\r\nof that his Majesty had no doubt--was due to a subtle sense of fear\r\nwhich had made him conscious of his wife's presence, although from her\r\nposition and his own he could not possibly have seen her approach.\r\n\r\nThis made him still more vexed with Lydie, and as she seemed calmly to\r\nbe waiting for an explanation, he replied quite gruffly:\r\n\r\n\"Nay, madame, you mistake; I assure you milor and ourselves are\r\nperfectly at one--we were so until a few moments ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Until I came,\" she said quietly. \"I am glad of that, for 'twill be\r\neasy enough, I hope, to convince your Majesty that my presence can\r\nhave made no difference to M. le Contrôleur's attitude of deep\r\nrespect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardi, we hope not!\" interposed Mme. de Pompadour acidly; \"but we\r\nhope milor hath found his tongue at last and will do the convincing\r\nhimself.\"\r\n\r\nBut Louis XV was not prepared to reopen the discussion in the presence\r\nof Mme. Lydie. He knew, quite as well as M. le Duc d'Aumont himself,\r\nthat she would have nothing but contempt and horror for that infamous\r\nproposal, which he was more determined than ever to accept.\r\n\r\nIt was tiresome of course not to have the coöperation of Lord\r\nEglinton; that weak fool now would, no doubt, be overruled by his\r\nwife. At the same time--and Louis hugged the thought as it sprang to\r\nhis mind--there were other ways of obtaining possession of Charles\r\nEdward Stuart's person than the direct one which he had proposed to\r\nmilor just now. The young Pretender was bound sooner or later to leave\r\nthe shores of Scotland. Unbeknown to King Louis a ship might be sent\r\nby private friends to rescue the fugitive, but that ship could be\r\nintercepted on her way home, and, after all, Charles Edward was bound\r\nto land in France some day!--and then----\r\n\r\nAnd there were other means besides of earning the tempting millions.\r\nBut these would have to be thought out, planned and arranged; they\r\nwould be difficult and not nearly so expeditious, which was a drawback\r\nwhen royal coffers were clamouring to be filled. Still, it would be\r\ndistinctly unadvisable to broach the subject with Mme. la Marquise\r\nd'Eglinton, and unnecessarily humiliating, since a rebuff was sure to\r\nbe the result.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when--as if in placid defiance of Pompadour's\r\nchallenge--Lord Eglinton handed the Duke of Cumberland's letter\r\nsilently back to the King, the latter slipped it into his pocket with\r\na gesture of ostentatious indifference.\r\n\r\n\"Nay! we need not trouble Mme. la Marquise with the discussion now,\"\r\nhe said; \"she is unacquainted with the subject of our present\r\nconversation, and it would be tedious to reiterate.\"\r\n\r\n\"I crave your pardon, Sire,\" rejoined Lydie, \"if I have transgressed,\r\nbut my zeal in the service of France and in that of your Majesty has\r\nrendered my senses preternaturally acute. My eyes see in the gloom, my\r\nears hear across vast spaces.\"\r\n\r\n\"In a word, Mme. la Marquise has been listening!\" said Pompadour, with\r\na sneer.\r\n\r\n\"I did not listen,\" said Lydie quietly. \"I only heard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you know?\" said Louis, with well-assumed indifference.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes!\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled at him as she replied. This was apparently a day of\r\nsurprises, for the smile seemed distinctly encouraging.\r\n\r\n\"And--and what do you say?\" asked his Majesty somewhat anxiously, yet\r\nemboldened by that encouraging smile.\r\n\r\nOf a truth! was he about to find an ally there, where he expected most\r\nbitter opposition?\r\n\r\n\"Meseems that milor was somewhat hasty,\" replied Lydie quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a sigh of intense, deep, heartfelt, satisfaction breathed by\r\nLouis the Well-beloved, and unrestrainedly echoed by Mme. de\r\nPompadour.\r\n\r\n\"This proposal, Sire,\" continued Lydie; \"'tis from England, I\r\nunderstand?\"\r\n\r\n\"From his Grace of Cumberland himself, Madame,\" assented the King,\r\nonce more drawing the letter from out his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"May I be permitted to see it?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Louis hesitated, then he gave her the letter. There was\r\nno risk in this, since she practically owned to knowing its contents.\r\n\r\nAnd the whole affair would be so much easier, so much more expeditious\r\nwith the coöperation of the Eglintons.\r\n\r\nLydie read the letter through, seemingly deeply engrossed in its\r\ncontents. She never once raised her eyes to see how she was being\r\nwatched. She knew quite well that the King's eyes were fixed eagerly\r\nupon her face, that Pompadour's cupidity and greed for the proposed\r\nmillions were plainly writ upon her face. But she had not once looked\r\nat her husband. She did not look at him now. He had not spoken since\r\nthat sudden burst of indignation, when his slender hand crushed the\r\ninfamous document which she now studied so carefully, crushed it and\r\nwould have torn it to ribbons in loathing and contempt.\r\n\r\nWhen first she interposed he had turned and faced her. Since then she\r\nknew that his eyes had remained fixed on her face. She felt the gaze,\r\nyet cared not to return it. He was too weak, too simple to understand,\r\nand of her own actions she would be sole mistress; that had been the\r\nchief clause in the contract when she placed her hand in his.\r\n\r\nHer intuitive knowledge of this Court in which she moved, her\r\nsuspicions of this feeble monarch, whose extravagant caprices had led\r\nhim to deeds at which in his earlier days he had been the first to\r\nblush, her dread of intrigues and treachery, all had whispered in her\r\near the word of prudence--\"Temporize.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole infamous plan had been revealed to her through those same\r\nsupernaturally keen senses, which her strong domineering nature had\r\ncoerced, until they became the slaves of her will. Mingling with the\r\ncrowd, her graceful body present in the chattering throng, her mind\r\nhad remained fixed on that group beside the bed. She had noticed the\r\nKing's expression of face when he engaged milor in conversation, his\r\nextraordinary _bonhomie_, his confidential attitude, his whispers, all\r\nbacked and seconded by Pompadour. Gradually she manœuvred and, still\r\nforming a unit with the rest of the crowd, she had by degrees drawn\r\nnearer and nearer, until she saw her husband's movement, his almost\r\nimperceptible change of expression, as he clutched the letter which\r\nwas handed him by the King.\r\n\r\nThen she boldly entered the inner precincts; being privileged, she\r\ncould do even that, without creating attention. Milor's words of\r\ncontempt, the royal arms of England on the seal of the letter, coupled\r\nwith her father's attitude with her just now, and his veiled\r\nsuggestions, told her all she wanted to know. And quick as flashes of\r\nsummer lightning her woman's intuition whispered words of wisdom in\r\nher ear.\r\n\r\n\"Know everything first--then temporize! Diplomacy will do more than\r\ndefiance.\"\r\n\r\nHaving read the letter through, she of course knew all. It was simple\r\nenough--a monstrous proposal which the King of France was ready to\r\nadopt. She felt real physical nausea at contact with so much infamy.\r\n\r\nBut she folded the document neatly and carefully, then looked quietly\r\nat the King.\r\n\r\n\"The Duke of Cumberland is generous,\" she said, forcing herself to\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"Heu, heu!\" assented Louis lightly, with a return of his wonted\r\n_bonhomie_. Matters were shaping themselves to a truly satisfactory\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\"Do I understand that your Majesty would desire us to accept his\r\nGrace's proposal?\"\r\n\r\n\"What think you yourself, Madame?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is worth considering,\" she mused.\r\n\r\n\"Parbleu! And you are a true woman!\" exclaimed Louis XV, beaming with\r\ndelight. \"Full of wisdom as a statesman should be. To think that we\r\ncould ever have mistrusted so clear a head and so sound a judgment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty, I hope, will always remember that my sole desire is to\r\nserve France and her King!\"\r\n\r\n\"Par ma foi! We'll not forget your help in this, Madame,\" he exclaimed\r\nwhole-heartedly. \"Then we may rely on your help?\"\r\n\r\n\"What does your Majesty desire me to do?\"\r\n\r\nHe came quite close to her, and she forced herself not to draw back\r\none inch. For the sake of the fugitive prince and his friends, who had\r\ntrusted in the honour of France; for the sake of that honour which, in\r\nher peculiar position, was as dear to her as her own, she would not\r\nflinch now; she would show no repulsion, no fear, though her whole\r\nbeing rose in revolt at contact with this man.\r\n\r\nA man, not a king! Par Dieu, not a King of France!\r\n\r\nHis face to her looked hideous, the eyes seemed to leer, and there was\r\nlust for money, and ignoble treachery writ on every feature.\r\n\r\n\"We have explained it all to milor,\" whispered Louis under his breath;\r\n\"a ship to be commissioned and sent to meet the Stuart. She will have\r\nsecret orders--no one shall know but her captain--and he will be a man\r\nwhom we can trust--a man whom we shall have to pay--you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then from you we want to know the place in Scotland where we will\r\nfind Charles Edward--eh? And also a token--a ring, a word perhaps, by\r\nwhich that young adventurer will be made to trust his own person and\r\nthat of his friends to our good ship. It is very simple, you see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite simple, your Majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"The ship's orders will be that once the Stuart and his faction are on\r\nboard, she shall make straight for the first English\r\nport--and--and--that is all!\" he added complacently.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is all, your Majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"And on the day that Charles Edward Stuart is handed over to the\r\nEnglish authorities, there will be fifteen millions for your King,\r\nMadame, and a million livres pin money for the most able statesman in\r\nEurope.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with consummate gallantry, Louis bowed very low and took her hand\r\nin his. It rested cold and inert between his hot fingers, but he was\r\nfar too eager, far too triumphant to notice anything beyond the fact\r\nthat he had succeeded in enlisting the help of Lydie d'Eglinton,\r\nwithout whom his project was bound to have been considerably delayed,\r\nif not completely frustrated. He had indeed not wasted this glorious\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n\"I am eternally your debtor, Madame!\" he said gaily; \"and 'tis well,\r\nbelieve me, to serve the King of France.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have done nothing as yet, Sire,\" she rejoined.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, but you will,\" he said confidently.\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head and he interpreted the movement according to his\r\nwill. But he was impatient, longing to see this matter finally settled\r\nto his entire satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Will you not give me a definite answer now?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the midst of so much chatter, Sire?\" she said, forcing herself to\r\nsmile gaily. \"Nay, but 'tis a serious matter--and I must consult with\r\nmy father.\"\r\n\r\nLouis smiled contentedly. M. le Duc d'Aumont was at one with him in\r\nthis. The letter had been originally sent to the Prime Minister, and\r\nthe Duke, who was weak, who was a slave to the Bourbon dynasty, and\r\nwho, alas! was also tainted with that horrible canker which was\r\ngradually affecting the whole of the aristocracy of France, the\r\ninsatiable greed for money, had been bribed to agree with the King.\r\n\r\nTherefore Louis was content. It was as well that Lydie should speak\r\nwith the Duke. The worthy D'Aumont would dissipate her last lingering\r\nscruples.\r\n\r\n\"And your husband?\" he added, casting a quick glance over his shoulder\r\nat milor, and smiling with good-natured sarcasm.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my husband will think as I do,\" she replied evasively.\r\n\r\nAt thought of her father and the King's complacent smile, Lydie had\r\nwinced. For a moment her outward calm threatened to forsake her. She\r\nfelt as if she could not keep up this hideous comedy any longer. She\r\nwould have screamed aloud with horror or contempt, aye! and deep\r\nsorrow, too, to think that her father wallowed in this mire.\r\n\r\nShe too cast a quick glance at milor. His eyes were no longer fixed on\r\nher face. He stood quietly beside Madame de Pompadour, who, leaving\r\nthe King to settle with Lydie, had engaged Lord Eglinton in frivolous\r\nconversation. He was quite placid again, and in his face, gentle and\r\ndiffident as usual, there was no longer the faintest trace of that\r\nsudden outburst of withering contempt.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland's letter was still in her hand. It seemed to\r\nscorch her fingers with its loathsome pollution. But she clung to it,\r\nand after a violent effort at self control, she contrived to look\r\nLouis straight in the face and to give him a reassuring smile, as she\r\nslipped the letter into the bosom of her gown.\r\n\r\n\"I will consult with my father, Sire,\" she repeated, \"and will read\r\nthe letter when I am alone and undisturbed.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you will give me a final answer?\"\r\n\r\n\"The day after to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not sooner?\" he urged impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"The day after to-morrow,\" she reiterated with a smile. \"I have much\r\nto think about, and--the only token which Charles Edward would trust\r\nwithout demur must come from Lord Eglinton.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" said the King knowingly. \"Par ma foi! But we shall\r\nwant patience. Two whole days! In the meanwhile we'll busy ourselves\r\nwith preparations for the expedition. We had thought of _Le Monarque_.\r\nWhat say you?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Le Levantin_ would be swifter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes! _Le Levantin_--and we can trust her captain. He is under\r\ndeep obligation to Madame de Pompadour. And M. de Lugeac, Madame's\r\nnephew, you know--we had thought of him to carry the secret orders to\r\nBrest to the captain of _Le Levantin_ directly she is ready to sail.\r\nMethinks we could trust him. His interests are bound up with ours. And\r\nthere is another, too; but more of that anon. The secret orders will\r\nbear our own royal signature, and you might place them yourself, with\r\nthe token, in our chosen messenger's hands.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more he gave her a gracious nod, and she curtseyed with all the\r\ndeference, all the formality which the elaborate etiquette of the\r\ntime demanded. Louis looked at her long and searchingly, but\r\napparently there was nothing in the calm, serene face to disturb his\r\npresent mood of complacent satisfaction. He put out his podgy hand to\r\nher; the short, thick fingers were covered with rings up to their\r\nfirst joint, and Lydie contrived to kiss the large signet--an emblem\r\nof that kingship to which she was true and loyal--without letting her\r\nlips come in contact with his flesh.\r\n\r\nWhat happened during the next ten minutes she could not afterward have\r\nsaid. Her whole mind was in a turmoil of thought, and every time the\r\ninfamous letter crackled beneath her corselet, she shuddered as with\r\nfear. Quite mechanically she saw the King's departure, and apparently\r\nshe acted with perfect decorum and correctness. Equally, mechanically\r\nshe saw the chattering throng gradually disperse. The vast room became\r\nmore and more empty, the buzz less and less loud. She saw milor as\r\nthrough a mist, mostly with back bent, receiving the _adieux_ of\r\nsycophants; she heard various murmurs in her own ears, mostly requests\r\nthat she should remember and be ready to give, or at least to promise.\r\nShe saw the procession of courtiers, of flatterers, of friends and\r\nenemies pass slowly before her; in the midst of them she vaguely\r\ndistinguished Mme. de Stainville's brightly coloured gown.\r\n\r\nLa belle Irène lingered a long time beside milor. She was one of the\r\nlast to leave, and though Lydie forced herself not to look in that\r\ndirection, she could not help hearing the other woman's irritating\r\ngiggle, and Lord Eglinton's even, pleasant voice framing compliments,\r\nthat pandered to that brainless doll's insatiable vanity.\r\n\r\nAnd this when he knew that his friend was about to be betrayed.\r\n\r\nThe taint! The horror! The pollution of it all!\r\n\r\nFortunately she had not seen her father, for her fortitude might have\r\nbroken down if she read that same awful thought of treachery in his\r\nface that had so disgusted her when Louis stood beside her.\r\n\r\nThe last of that senseless, indifferent crowd had gone. The vast room\r\nwas empty. Milor had accompanied Mme. de Stainville as far as the\r\ndoor. The murmur of talk and laughter came now only as a faint and\r\nlingering echo. Anon it died away in the distant corridors.\r\n\r\nLydie shivered as if with cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nSTRANGERS\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now she was alone.\r\n\r\nTorpor had left her; even that intensity of loathing had gone, which\r\nfor the past half-hour had numbed her very senses and caused her to\r\nmove and speak like an irresponsible automaton. She felt as if she had\r\nindeed seen and touched a filthy, evil reptile, but that for the\r\nmoment it had gone out of her sight. Presently it would creep out of\r\nits lair again, but by that time she would be prepared.\r\n\r\nShe must be prepared; therefore she no longer shuddered at the horror\r\nof it, but called her wits to her aid, her cool judgment and habitual\r\nquick mode of action, to combat the monster and render it powerless.\r\n\r\nShe knew of course that the King would not allow himself to be put off\r\nwith vague promises. Within the two days' delay which she had asked of\r\nhim he would begin to realize that she had only meant to temporise,\r\nand never had any intention of helping him in his nefarious schemes.\r\nThen he would begin to act for himself.\r\n\r\nHaving understood that she meant to circumvent him if she could, he\r\nwas quite shrewd enough to devise some means of preventing those\r\ntempting millions from eluding his grasp. Though he did not know at\r\nthe present moment where or how to lay his hands on Prince Charles\r\nEdward and his friends, he knew that they would of necessity seek the\r\nloneliness of the west coast of Scotland.\r\n\r\nVaguely that particular shore had always been spoken of in connection\r\nwith any expedition for the succour of the unfortunate prince, and\r\nalthough the commissioning of ships was under the direct\r\nadministration of the Comptrôlleur-Général of Finance, Louis, with the\r\nprospective millions dangling before him, could easily enough equip\r\n_Le Levantin_, and send her on a searching expedition without having\r\nrecourse to State funds; whilst it was more than likely that Charles\r\nEdward, wearied of waiting, and in hourly fear of detection and\r\ncapture, would be quite ready to trust himself and his friends to any\r\nFrench ship that happened to come on his track, whether her captain\r\nbrought him a token from his friend or not.\r\n\r\nAll this and more would occur to King Louis, of course, in the event\r\nof her finally refusing him coöperation, or trying to put him off\r\nlonger than a few days. Just as she had thought it all out, visualized\r\nhis mind, as it were, so these various plans would present themselves\r\nto him sooner of later. It was a great thing to have gained two days.\r\nForty-eight hours' start of that ignoble scheme would, she hoped,\r\nenable her to counteract it yet.\r\n\r\nSo much for King Louis and his probable schemes! Now her own plans.\r\n\r\nTo circumvent this awful treachery, to forestall it, that of course\r\nhad become her task, and it should not be so difficult, given that two\r\ndays' start and some one whom she could trust.\r\n\r\nPlans now became a little clearer in her head; they seemed gradually\r\nto disentangle themselves from a maze of irrelevant thoughts.\r\n\r\n_Le Monarque_ was ready to start at any moment. Captain Barre, her\r\ncommander, was the soul of honour. A messenger swift and sure and\r\ntrustworthy must ride to Le Havre forthwith with orders to the captain\r\nto set sail at once, to reach that lonely spot on the west coast of\r\nScotland known only to herself and to her husband, where Charles\r\nEdward Stuart and his friends were even now waiting for succour.\r\n\r\nThe signet-ring--Lord Eglinton's--entrusted to Captain Barre should\r\nensure the fugitives' immediate confidence. There need be no delay,\r\nand with favourable wind and weather _Le Monarque_ should have the\r\nPrince and his friends on board her before _Le Levantin_ had been got\r\nready to start.\r\n\r\nThen _Le Monarque_ should not return home direct; she should skirt the\r\nIrish coast and make for Brittany by a circuitous route; a grave delay\r\nperhaps, but still the risks of being intercepted must be minimised at\r\nall costs.\r\n\r\nA lonely village inland would afford shelter to the Young Pretender\r\nand his adherents for a while, until arrangements could be made for\r\nthe final stage of their journey into safety--Austria, Spain, or any\r\ncountry in fact where Louis' treachery could not overtake them.\r\n\r\nIt was a big comprehensive scheme, of course; one which must be\r\ncarried to its completion in defiance of King Louis. It was never good\r\nto incur the wrath of a Bourbon, and, unless the nation and the\r\nparliaments ranged themselves unequivocally on her side, it would\r\nprobably mean the sudden ending of her own and her husband's career,\r\nthe finality of all her dreams. But to this she hardly gave a\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nThe project itself was not difficult of execution, provided she had\r\nthe coöperation of a man whom she could absolutely trust. This was the\r\nmost important detail in connection with her plans, and it alone could\r\nensure their success.\r\n\r\nHer ally, whoever he might be, would have to start this very afternoon\r\nfor Le Havre, taking with him the orders for Captain Barre and the\r\nsignet ring which she would give him.\r\n\r\nThere were one hundred and fifty leagues between Versailles and Le\r\nHavre as the crow flies, and Lydie was fully aware of the measure of\r\nstrength and endurance which a forced ride across country and without\r\ndrawing rein would entail.\r\n\r\nIt would mean long gallops at breakneck speed, whilst slowly the\r\nsummer's day yielded to the embrace of evening, and anon the glowing\r\ndusk paled and swooned into the arms of night. It would mean a swift\r\nand secret start at the hour when the scorching afternoon sun had not\r\nyet lifted its numbing weight from the journeyman's limbs and still\r\nlulled the brain of the student to drowsiness and the siesta; the hour\r\nwhen the luxurious idler was just waking from sleep, and the labourer\r\nout in the field stretched himself after the noonday rest.\r\n\r\nIt would mean above all youth and enthusiasm; for Le Havre must be\r\nreached ere the rising sun brought the first blush of dawn on cliffs,\r\nand crags, and sea; _Le Monarque_ must set sail for Scotland ere\r\nFrance woke from her sleep.\r\n\r\nTwelve hours in the saddle, a good mount, the strength of a young\r\nbullock, and the astuteness of a fox!\r\n\r\nLydie still sat in the window embrasure, her eyes closed, her graceful\r\nhead with its wealth of chestnut hair resting against the delicate\r\ncoloured cushions of her chair, her perfectly modelled arms bared to\r\nthe elbow lying listlessly in her lap, one hand holding the infamous\r\nletter, written by the Duke of Cumberland to King Louis. She herself a\r\npicture of thoughtful repose, statuesque and cool.\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of her whole personality that she sat thus quite\r\ncalmly, thinking out the details of her plan, apparently neither\r\nflustered nor excited. The excitement was within, the desire to be up\r\nand doing, but she would have despised herself if she had been unable\r\nto conquer the outward expressions of her agitation, the longing to\r\nwalk up and down, to tear up that ignoble letter, or to smash some\r\ninoffensive article that happened to be lying by.\r\n\r\nHer thoughts then could not have been so clear. She could not have\r\nvisualized the immediate future; the departure of _Le Monarque_ at\r\ndawn--Captain Barre receiving the signet-ring--that breakneck ride to\r\nLe Havre.\r\n\r\nThen gradually from out the rest of the picture one figure detached\r\nitself from her mind--her husband.\r\n\r\n\"Le petit Anglais,\" the friend of Charles Edward Stuart; weak,\r\nluxurious, tactless, but surely loyal.\r\n\r\nLydie half smiled when the thought first took shape. She knew so\r\nlittle of her husband. Just now, when she heard him condemn the King's\r\ntreacherous proposals with such unequivocal words of contempt, she had\r\nhalf despised him for this blundering want of diplomatic art. Manlike\r\nhe had been unable to disguise his loathing for Louis' perfidy, and by\r\ntrying to proclaim his loyalty to his friend, all but precipitated\r\nthe catastrophe that would have delivered Charles Edward Stuart into\r\nthe hands of the English. But for Lydie's timely interference the\r\nKing, angered and huffed, would have departed then and there and\r\nmatured his own schemes before anything could be done to foil them.\r\n\r\nBut with her feeling of good-natured disdain, there had even then\r\nmingled a sensation of trust; this she recalled now when her mind went\r\nin search of the man in whom she could confide. She would in any case\r\nhave to ask her husband for the token agreed on between him and the\r\nStuart Prince, and also for final directions as to the exact spot\r\nwhere the fugitives would be most surely found by Captain Barre.\r\n\r\nThen why should he not himself take both to Le Havre?\r\n\r\nAgain she smiled at the thought. The idea had occurred to her that she\r\ndid not even know if milor could ride. And if perchance he did sit a\r\nhorse well, had he the physical strength, the necessary endurance, for\r\nthat flight across country, without a halt, with scarce a morsel of\r\nfood on the way?\r\n\r\nShe knew so little about him. Their lives had been spent apart. One\r\nbrief year of wedded life, and they were more strange to one another\r\nthan even they had been before their marriage. He no doubt thought her\r\nhard and unfeminine, she of a truth deemed him weak and unmanly.\r\n\r\nStill there was no one else, and with her usual determination she\r\nforced her well-schooled mind to dismiss all those thoughts of her\r\nhusband which were disparaging to him. She tried not to see him as she\r\nhad done a little while ago, giving himself over so readily to the\r\nartificial life of this Court of Versailles and its enervating\r\netiquette, yielding to the whispered flatteries of Irène de\r\nStainville, pandering to her vanity, admiring her femininity no doubt\r\nin direct contrast to his wife's more robust individuality.\r\n\r\nAfterward, whenever she thought the whole matter over, she never could\r\ndescribe accurately the succession of events just as they occurred on\r\nthat morning. She seemed after a while to have roused herself from her\r\nmeditations, having fully made up her mind to carry her project\r\nthrough from beginning to end, and with that infamous letter still in\r\nher hand she rose from her chair and walked across the vast audience\r\nchamber, with the intention of going to her own study, there to think\r\nout quietly the final details of her plans.\r\n\r\nHer mind was of course intent on the Stuart Prince and his friends: on\r\n_Le Monarque_ and Captain Barre, and also very much now on her\r\nhusband; but she could never recollect subsequently at what precise\r\nmoment the actual voice of Lord Eglinton became mingled with her\r\nthoughts of him.\r\n\r\nCertain it is that, when in crossing the room she passed close to the\r\nthronelike bedstead, whereupon her strangely perturbed imagination\r\nwilfully conjured up the picture of milor holding his court, with la\r\nbelle Irène in a brilliant rose-coloured gown complacently receiving\r\nhis marked attentions, she suddenly heard him speak:\r\n\r\n\"One second, I entreat you, Madame, if you can spare it!\"\r\n\r\nHer own hand at the moment was on that gilded knob of the door,\r\nthrough which she had been about to pass. His voice came from\r\nsomewhere close behind her.\r\n\r\nShe turned slightly toward him, and saw him standing there, looking\r\nvery fixedly at her, with a gaze which had something of entreaty in\r\nit, and also an unexplainable subtle something which at first she\r\ncould not quite understand.\r\n\r\n\"I was going to my study, milor,\" she said, a little taken aback, for\r\nshe certainly had not thought him in the room.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore I must crave your indulgence if I intrude,\" he said simply.\r\n\r\n\"Can I serve you in any way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your ladyship is pleased to be gracious----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\nShe was accustomed to his diffident manner and to his halting speech,\r\nwhich usually had the knack of irritating her. But just now she seemed\r\ninclined to be kind. She felt distinctly pleased that he was here. To\r\nher keenly sensitive nature it seemed as if it had been her thoughts\r\nwhich had called to him, and that something in him responded to her\r\nwish that he should be the man to take her confidential message to the\r\ncommander of _Le Monarque_.\r\n\r\nNow his eyes dropped from her face and fixed themselves on the hand\r\nwhich had fallen loosely to her side.\r\n\r\n\"That paper which you hold, Madame----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I pray you give it to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"To you? Why?\" she asked, as the encouraging smile suddenly vanished\r\nfrom her face.\r\n\r\n\"Because I cannot bear the sight of Mme. la Marquise d'Eglinton, my\r\nwife, sullying her fingers one second longer by contact with this\r\ninfamy.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke very quietly, in that even, gentle, diffident voice of his,\r\nwhilst his eyes once more riveted themselves on her face.\r\n\r\nInstinctively she clutched the letter tighter, and her whole figure\r\nseemed to stiffen as she looked at him full now, a deep frown between\r\nher eyes, her whole attitude suggestive of haughty surprise and of\r\nlofty contempt. There was dead silence in the vast room save for the\r\ncrackling of that paper, which to a keenly sensitive ear would have\r\nsuggested the idea that the dainty hand which held it was not as\r\nsteady as its owner would have wished.\r\n\r\nIt seemed suddenly as if with the speaking of a few words these two\r\npeople, who had been almost strangers, had by a subtle process become\r\nantagonists, and were unconsciously measuring one another's strength,\r\nmistrustful of one another's hidden weapons. But already the woman was\r\nprepared for a conflict of will, a contest for that hitherto\r\nundisputed mastery, which she vaguely feared was being attacked, and\r\nwhich she would not give up, be the cost of defence what it may,\r\nwhilst the man was still diffident, still vaguely hopeful that she\r\nwould not fight, for his armour was vulnerable where hers was not, and\r\nshe owned certain weapons which he knew himself too weak to combat.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore I proffer my request again, Madame,\" he said after a pause.\r\n\"That paper----\"\r\n\r\n\"A strong request, milor,\" said Lydie coldly.\r\n\r\n\"It is more than a request, Madame.\"\r\n\r\n\"A command perhaps?\"\r\n\r\nHe did not reply; obviously he had noted the sneer, for a very slight\r\nblush rose to his pale cheeks. Lydie, satisfied that the shaft had\r\ngone home, paused awhile, just long enough to let the subtle poison of\r\nher last words sink well in, then she resumed with calm indifference:\r\n\r\n\"You will forgive me, milor, when I venture to call your attention to\r\nthe fact that hitherto I have considered myself to be the sole judge\r\nand mentor of my own conduct.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly this has worked very well in all matters, Madame,\" he\r\nreplied, quite unruffled by her sarcasm, \"but in this instance you see\r\nme compelled to ask you--reluctantly I admit--to give me that letter\r\nand then to vouchsafe me an explanation as to what you mean to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will receive it in due course, milor,\" she said haughtily; \"for\r\nthe moment I must ask you to excuse me. I am busy, and----\"\r\n\r\nShe was conscious of an overwhelming feeling of irritation at his\r\ninterference and, fearing to betray it beyond the bounds of courtesy,\r\nshe wished to go away. But now he deliberately placed his hand on the\r\nknob, and stood between her and the door.\r\n\r\n\"Milor!\" she protested.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am afraid I am very clumsy, Madame,\" he said quite gently.\r\n\"Let us suppose that French good manners have never quite succeeded in\r\ngetting the best of my English boorishness. I know it is against every\r\nrule of etiquette that I should stand between you and the door through\r\nwhich you desire to pass, but I have humbly asked for an explanation\r\nand also for that letter, and I cannot allow your ladyship to go until\r\nI have had it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow?\" she said, with a short mocking laugh. \"Surely, milor, you\r\nwill not force me to refer to the compact to which you willingly\r\nsubscribed when you asked me to be your wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis not necessary, Madame, for I well remember it. I gave you a\r\npromise not to interfere with your life, such as you had chosen to\r\norganize it. I promised to leave you free in thought, action, and\r\nconduct, just as you had been before you honoured me by consenting to\r\nbear my name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, milor?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"This is a different matter, Mme. la Marquise,\" he replied calmly,\r\n\"since it concerns mine own honour and that of my name. Of that honour\r\nI claim to be the principal guardian.\"\r\n\r\nThen as she seemed disinclined to vouchsafe a rejoinder he continued,\r\nwith just a shade more vehemence in his tone:\r\n\r\n\"The proposal which His Majesty placed before me awhile ago, that same\r\nletter which you still hold in your hand, are such vile and noisome\r\nthings that actual contact with them is pollution. As I see you now\r\nwith that infamous document between those fingers which I have had the\r\nhonour to kiss, it seems to me as if you were clutching a hideous and\r\nvenomous reptile, the very sight of which should have been loathsome\r\nto you, and from which I should have wished to see you turn as you\r\nwould from a slimy toad.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you did yourself, milor?\" she said with a contemptuous shrug of\r\nthe shoulders, thinking of his blunder, of the catastrophe which he\r\nall but precipitated, and which her more calm diplomacy had perhaps\r\naverted.\r\n\r\n\"As I did, though no doubt very clumsily,\" he admitted simply, \"the\r\nmoment I grasped its purport to the full. To see you, my wife--yes, my\r\nwife,\" he repeated with unusual firmness in answer to a subtle,\r\nindefinable expression which at his words had lit up her face, \"to see\r\nyou pause if only for one brief half hour with that infamy before your\r\neyes, with that vile suggestion reaching and dwelling in your brain\r\nthe man who made it--be he King of France, I care not--kissing those\r\nsame fingers which held the abominable thing, was unspeakably horrible\r\nin my sight; it brought real physical agony to every one of my senses.\r\nI endured it only for so long as etiquette demanded, hoping against\r\nhope that every second which went by would witness your cry of\r\nindignation, your contempt for that vile and execrable letter which,\r\nhad you not interposed, I myself would have flung in the lying face of\r\nthat kingly traitor. But you smiled at him in response; you took the\r\nletter from him! My God, I saw you put it in the bosom of your gown!\"\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment, as if ashamed of this outburst of passion, so\r\ndifferent to his usual impassiveness. It seemed as if her haughty\r\nlook, her ill-concealed contempt, was goading him on, beyond the\r\nbounds of restraint which he had meant to impose on himself. She no\r\nlonger now made an attempt to go. She was standing straight before\r\nhim, leaning slightly back against the portière--a curtain of rich,\r\nheavy silk of that subtle brilliant shade, 'twixt a scarlet and a\r\ncrimson, which is only met with in certain species of geranium.\r\n\r\nAgainst this glowing background her slim, erect figure, stiff with\r\nunbendable pride, stood out in vivid relief. The red of the silk cast\r\nardent reflections into her chestnut hair, and against the creamy\r\nwhiteness of her neck and ear. The sober, almost conventual gray of\r\nher gown, the primly folded kerchief at her throat, the billows of\r\nlace around the graceful arm formed an exquisite note of tender colour\r\nagainst that glaring geranium red. In one hand she still held the\r\nletter, the other rested firmly against the curtain. The head was\r\nthrown back, the lips slightly parted and curled in disdain, the\r\neyes--half veiled--looked at him through long fringed lashes.\r\n\r\nA picture worthy to inflame the passion of any man. Lord Eglinton,\r\nwith a mechanical movement of the hand across his forehead, seemed to\r\nbrush away some painful and persistent thought.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, do not pause, milor,\" she said quietly. \"Believe me, you\r\ninterest me vastly.\"\r\n\r\nHe frowned and bit his lip.\r\n\r\n\"Your pardon, Madame,\" he rejoined more calmly now. \"I was forgetting\r\nthe limits of courtly manners. I have little more to say. I would not\r\nhave troubled you with so much talk, knowing that my feeling in such\r\nmatters can have no interest for your ladyship. When awhile ago this\r\ngreat bare room was at last free from the bent-backed, mouthing\r\nflatterers that surround you, I waited patiently for a spontaneous\r\nword from you, something to tell me that the honour of my name, one of\r\nthe oldest in England, was not like to be stained by contact with the\r\ndiplomatic by-ways of France. I had not then thought of asking for an\r\nexplanation; I waited for you to speak. Instead of which I saw you\r\ntake that miserable letter once more in your hand, sit and ponder over\r\nit without a thought or look for me. I saw your face, serene and\r\nplacid, your attitude one of statesmanlike calm, as without a word or\r\nnod you prepared to pass out of my sight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you thought fit to demand from me an explanation of my conduct\r\nin a matter in which you swore most solemnly a year ago that you would\r\nnever interfere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Demand is a great word, Madame,\" he said, now quite gently. \"I do\r\nnot demand; I ask for an explanation on my knees.\"\r\n\r\nAnd just as he had done a year ago when first she laid her hand in his\r\nand he made his profession of faith, he dropped on one knee and bent\r\nhis head, until his aching brow almost touched her gown.\r\n\r\nShe looked down on him from the altitude of her domineering pride; she\r\nsaw his broad shoulders, bent in perfect humility, his chestnut hair\r\nfree from the conventional powder, the slender hands linked together\r\nnow in a strangely nervous clasp, and she drew back because her skirt\r\nseemed perilously near his fingers.\r\n\r\nWill the gods ever reveal the secret of a woman's heart? Lydie loathed\r\nthe King's proposal, the letter which she held, just as much as Lord\r\nEglinton did himself. Awhile ago she had hardly been able to think or\r\nto act coherently while she felt the contact of that noisome paper\r\nagainst her flesh. If she had smiled on Louis, if she had taken the\r\nletter away from him with vague promises that she would think the\r\nmatter over, it had been solely because she knew the man with whom she\r\nhad to deal better than did milor Eglinton, who had but little\r\nexperience of the Court of Versailles, since he had kept away from it\r\nduring the major part of his life. She had only meant to temporize\r\nwith the King, because she felt sure that that was the only way to\r\nserve the Stuart Prince and to avert the treachery.\r\n\r\nNay, more, in her heart she felt that milor was right; she knew that\r\nwhen a thing is so vile and so abominable as Louis' proposed scheme,\r\nall contact with it _is_ a pollution, and that it is impossible to\r\nfinger slimy mud without some of it clinging to flesh or gown.\r\n\r\nYet with all that in her mind, a subtle perversity seemed suddenly to\r\nhave crept into her heart, a perversity and also a bitter sense of\r\ninjustice. She and her husband had been utter strangers since the day\r\nof their marriage, she had excluded him from her counsels, just as she\r\nhad done from her heart and mind. She had never tried to understand\r\nhim, and merely fostered that mild contempt which his diffidence and\r\nhis meekness had originally roused in her. Yet at this moment when he\r\nso obviously misunderstood her, when he thought that her attitude with\r\nregard to the King's proposals was one of acceptance, or at least not\r\nof complete condemnation, her pride rose in violent revolt.\r\n\r\nHe had no right to think her so base. He had invaded her thoughts at\r\nthe very moment when they dwelt on his friend and the best mode to\r\nsave him; nay, more, was she not proposing to associate him, who now\r\naccused her so groundlessly, with her work of devotion and loyalty?\r\n\r\nHe should have known, he should have guessed, and now she hated him\r\nfor his thoughts of her; she who had kept herself untainted in the\r\nmidst of the worst corruption that ever infested a Court, whose purity\r\nof motives, whose upright judgments had procured her countless enemies\r\namongst the imbecile and the infamous, she to be asked and begged to\r\nbe loyal and to despise treachery!\r\n\r\nNay, she was too proud now to explain. An explanation would seem like\r\na surrender, an acknowledgment--_par Dieu_ of what? and certainly a\r\nhumiliation.\r\n\r\nAccording to milor, her husband, was there not one single upright and\r\nloyal soul in France except his own? No honour save that of his own\r\nname?\r\n\r\nShe laughed suddenly, laughed loudly and long. Manlike, he did not\r\nnotice the forced ring of that merriment. He had blundered, of course,\r\nbut this he did not know. In the simplicity of his heart he thought\r\nthat she would have been ready to understand, that she would have\r\nexplained and then agreed with him as to the best means of throwing\r\nthe nefarious proposal back into the King's teeth.\r\n\r\nAt her laugh he sprang to his feet; every drop of blood seemed to have\r\nleft his cheeks, which were now ashy pale.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, milor,\" she said with biting sarcasm, \"but 'tis a mountain full\r\nof surprises that you display before my astonished fancy. Who had e'er\r\nsuspected you of so much eloquence? I vow I do not understand how your\r\nlordship could have seen so much of my doings just now, seeing that at\r\nthat moment you had eyes and ears only for Irène de Stainville.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mme. de Stainville hath naught to do with the present matter,\r\nMadame,\" he rejoined, \"nor with my request for an explanation from\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"I refuse to give it, milor,\" she said proudly, \"and as I have no wish\r\nto spoil or mar your pleasures, so do I pray you to remember our bond,\r\nwhich is that you leave me free to act and speak, aye, and to guide\r\nthe destinies of France if she have need of me, without interference\r\nfrom you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with that refinement of cruelty of which a woman's heart is\r\nsometimes capable at moments of acute crises, she carefully folded the\r\nEnglish letter and once more slipped it into the bosom of her gown.\r\nShe vouchsafed him no other look, but gathering her skirts round her\r\nshe turned and left him. Calm and erect she walked the whole length of\r\nthe room and then passed through another doorway finally out of his\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nSPLENDID ISOLATION\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Durand looked flustered when Lydie suddenly entered his sanctum.\r\nBut she was hardly conscious of his presence, or even of where she\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nThe vast audience chamber which she had just quitted so abruptly had\r\nonly the two exits; the one close to which she had left milor\r\nstanding, and the other which gave into this antechamber, where M.\r\nDurand usually sat for the express purpose of separating the wheat\r\nfrom the chaff--or, in other words, the suppliants who had letters of\r\nintroduction or passports to \"le petit lever\" of M. le\r\nContrôleur-Général, from those who had not.\r\n\r\nIt was not often that Mme. la Marquise came this way at all; no doubt\r\nthis accounted in some measure for M. Durand's agitation when she\r\nopened the door so suddenly. Had Lydie been less absorbed in her own\r\nthoughts she would have noticed that his hands fidgeted quite\r\nnervously with the papers on his bureau, and that his pale watery eyes\r\nwandered with anxious restlessness from her face to the heavy portière\r\nwhich masked one of the doors. But, indeed, at this moment neither M.\r\nDurand nor his surroundings existed for her; she crossed the\r\nantechamber rapidly without seeing him. She only wanted to get away,\r\nto put the whole enfilade of the next reception rooms between herself\r\nand the scene which had just taken place.\r\n\r\nSomething was ringing in her ears. She could not say for certain\r\nwhether she had really heard it, or whether her quivering nerves were\r\nplaying her a trick; but a cry had come to her across the vastness of\r\nthe great audience-chamber, and rang now even through the closed door.\r\n\r\nA cry of acute agony; a cry as of an animal in pain. The word:\r\n\"Lydie!\" The tone: one of reproach, of appeal, of aching, wounded\r\npassion!\r\n\r\nShe fled from it, unwilling to admit its reality, unwilling to believe\r\nher ears. She felt too deeply wounded herself to care for the pain of\r\nanother. She hoped, indeed, that she had grievously hurt his pride,\r\nhis self-respect, that very love which he had once professed for her,\r\nand which apparently had ceased to be.\r\n\r\nOnce he had knelt at her feet, comparing her to the Madonna, to the\r\nsaints whom Catholics revered yet dared not approach; then he talked\r\nof worship, and now he spoke of pollution, of stained honour, and\r\nasked her to keep herself free from taint. What right had he not to\r\nunderstand? If he still loved her, he would have understood. But\r\nconstant intercourse with Irène de Stainville had blurred his inward\r\nvision; the image of the Madonna, serene and unapproachable, had\r\nbecome faded and out of focus, and he now groped earthwards for less\r\nunattainable ideals.\r\n\r\nThat this was in any way her fault Lydie would not admit. She had\r\nbecome his wife because he had asked her, and because he had been\r\nwilling to cover her wounded vanity with the mantle of his adoration,\r\nand the glamour of his wealth and title. He knew her for what she was:\r\nstatuesque and cold, either more or less than an ordinary woman, since\r\nshe was wholly devoid of sentimentality; but with a purpose in her\r\nmind and a passion for work, for power and influence. Work for the\r\ngood of France! Power to attain this end!\r\n\r\nThus he had found her, thus he had first learned to love her! She had\r\ndenied him nothing that he had ever dared to ask. This had been a bond\r\nbetween them, which now he had tried to break; but if he had loved her\r\nas heretofore he would not have asked, he would have known. How, and\r\nby what subtle process of his mind Lydie did not care to analyze.\r\n\r\nHe would have known: he would have understood, if he still loved her.\r\n\r\nThese two phrases went hammering in her brain, a complement to that\r\ncry which still seemed to reach her senses, although the whole\r\nenfilade of reception rooms now stretched their vastness between her\r\nand that persistent echo.\r\n\r\nOf course his love had been naught to her. It was nothing more at best\r\nthan mute, somewhat dog-like adoration: a love that demanded nothing,\r\nthat was content to be, to exist passively and to worship from afar.\r\n\r\nWomanlike, she apprised it in inverse ratio to its obtrusiveness; the\r\nless that was asked of her, the less she thought it worth while to\r\ngive. But the love had always been there. At great social functions,\r\nin the midst of a crowd or in the presence of royalty, whenever she\r\nlooked across a room or over a sea of faces, she saw a pair of eyes\r\nwhich rested on her every movement with rapt attention and unspoken\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nNow she would have to forego that. The love was no longer there. On\r\nthis she insisted, repeating it to herself over and over again, though\r\nthis seemed to increase both the tension of her nerves, and the\r\nstrange tendency to weakness, from which her proud spirit shrank in\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nShe was walking very rapidly now, and as she reached the monumental\r\nstaircase, she ran down the steps without heeding the astonished\r\nglances of the army of flunkeys that stood about on landing and\r\ncorridors. In a moment she was out on the terrace, breathing more\r\nfreely as soon as she filled her lungs with the pure air of this\r\nglorious summer's day.\r\n\r\nAt first the light, the glare, the vibration of water and leaves under\r\nthe kiss of the midday sun dazzled her eyes so that she could not see.\r\nBut she heard the chirrup of the sparrows, the call of thrush and\r\nblackbird, and far away the hymn of praise of the skylark. Her\r\nnostrils drew in with glad intoxication the pungent fragrance of\r\noak-leaved geraniums, and her heart called out joyfully to the\r\nsecluded plantation of young beech trees there on her left, where she\r\noften used to wander.\r\n\r\nThither now she bent her steps. It was a favourite walk of hers, and a\r\ncherished spot, for she had it always before her when she sat in her\r\nown study at the angle of the West Wing. The tall windows of her\r\nprivate sanctum gave on this plantation, and whenever she felt wearied\r\nor disheartened with the great burden which she had taken on her\r\nshoulders, she would sit beside the open casements and rest her eyes\r\non the brilliant emerald or copper of the leaves, and find rest and\r\nsolace in the absolute peace they proclaimed.\r\n\r\nAnd, at times like the present one, when the park was still deserted,\r\nshe liked to wander in that miniature wood, crushing with delight the\r\nmoist bed of moss under her feet, letting the dew-covered twigs fall\r\nback with a swish against her hands. She found her way to a tiny\r\nglade, where a rough garden seat invited repose. The glade was\r\ncircular in shape, a perfect audience chamber, wherein to review a\r\nwhole army of fancies. On the ground a thick carpet of brilliant green\r\nwith designs of rich sienna formed by last year's leaves, and flecks\r\nof silver of young buds not yet scorched by the midday sun; all\r\naround, walls of parallel, slender trunks of a tender gray-green\r\ncolour, with bold patches of glaring viridian and gold intermixed with\r\ndull blue shadows. And then a dado of tall bracken fantastic in shape\r\nand almost weird in outline, through which there peeped here and\r\nthere, with insolent luxuriance, clumps of purple and snow-white\r\nfoxgloves.\r\n\r\nLydie sank on to the rough bench, leaning well back and resting her\r\nhead against the hard, uneven back of the seat. Her eyes gazed\r\nstraight upwards to a patch of vivid blue sky, almost crude and\r\nartificial-looking above the canopy of the beeches.\r\n\r\nShe felt unspeakably lonely, unspeakably forsaken. The sense of\r\ninjustice oppressed her even more than the atmosphere of treachery.\r\n\r\nHer father false and weak; her husband fickle and unjust! Prince\r\nCharles Edward abandoned, and she now powerless, probably, to carry\r\nthrough the work of rescue which she had planned! Until this moment\r\nshe had not realized how much she had counted on her husband to help\r\nher. Now that she could no longer ask him to ride to Le Havre, and\r\ntake her message to the commander of _Le Monarque_, she cast about her\r\nin vain for a substitute: some one whom she could trust. Her world was\r\nmade up of sycophants, of flatterers, of pleasure-loving fops. Where\r\nwas the man who would cover one hundred and eighty leagues in one\r\nnight in order to redeem a promise made by France?\r\n\r\nHer head ached with the agony of this thought. It was terrible to see\r\nher most cherished hope threatened with annihilation. Oh! had she been\r\na man! . . .\r\n\r\nTears gathered in her eyes. At other times she would have scorned the\r\nweakness, now she welcomed it, for it seemed to lift the load of\r\noppression from her heart. The glare of that vivid blue sky above\r\nweighed down her lids. She closed her eyes and for the space of a few\r\nseconds she seemed to forget everything; the world, and its treachery,\r\nthe palace of Versailles, the fugitives in Scotland.\r\n\r\nEverything except her loneliness, and the sound of that cry: \"Lydie!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nCLEVER TACTICS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as M. Durand had recovered from the shock of Madame la\r\nMarquise's sudden invasion of his sanctum, he ran to the portière\r\nwhich he had been watching so anxiously, and, pushing it aside, he\r\ndisclosed the door partially open.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur le Comte de Stainville!\" he called discreetly.\r\n\r\n\"Has she gone?\" came in a whisper from the inner room.\r\n\r\n\"Yes! yes! I pray you enter, M. le Comte,\" said M. Durand,\r\nobsequiously holding the portière aside. \"Madame la Marquise only\r\npassed through very quickly; she took notice of nothing, I assure\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nGaston de Stainville cast a quick searching glance round the room as\r\nhe entered, and fidgeted nervously with a lace handkerchief in his\r\nhand. No doubt his enforced sudden retreat at Lydie's approach had\r\nbeen humiliating to his pride. But he did not want to come on her too\r\nabruptly, and was chafing now because he needed a menial's help to\r\nfurther his desires.\r\n\r\n\"You were a fool, man, to place me in this awkward position,\" he said\r\nwith a scowl directed at M. Durand's meek personality, \"or else a\r\nknave, in which case . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten thousand pardons, M. le Comte,\" rejoined the little man\r\napologetically. \"Madame la Marquise scarcely ever comes this way\r\nafter _le petit lever_. She invariably retires to her study, and\r\nthither I should have had the honour to conduct you, according to your\r\nwish.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem very sure that Madame la Marquise would have granted me a\r\nprivate audience.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would have done my best to obtain one for M. Le Comte,\" said M.\r\nDurand with becoming modesty, \"and I think I should have succeeded\r\n. . . with tact and diplomacy, Monsieur le Comte, we, who are\r\nprivileged to . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes!\" interrupted Gaston impatiently, \"but now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! now it will be much more difficult. Madame la Marquise is not in\r\nher study, and . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"And you will want more pay,\" quoth Gaston with a sneer.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Monsieur le Comte . . .\" protested Durand.\r\n\r\n\"Well! how much more?\" said the Comte impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"What does M. le Comte desire?\"\r\n\r\n\"To speak with Madame la Marquise quite alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heu! . . . heu! . . . it is difficult. . . .\"\r\n\r\nBut Gaston de Stainville's stock of patience was running low. He never\r\nhad a great deal. With a violent oath he seized the little man by the\r\ncollar.\r\n\r\n\"Two louis, you knave, for getting me that audience now, at once, or\r\nmy flunkey's stick across your shoulders if you fool me any longer.\"\r\n\r\nM. Durand apparently was not altogether unprepared for this outburst:\r\nperhaps his peculiar position had often subjected him to similar\r\nonslaughts on the part of irate and aristocratic supplicants. Anyway,\r\nhe did not seem at all disturbed, and, as soon as the Comte's grip on\r\nhis collar relaxed, he readjusted his coat and his cravat, and holding\r\nout his thin hand, he said meekly:\r\n\r\n\"The two louis I pray you, Monsieur le Comte. And,\" he added, when\r\nGaston, with another oath, finally placed the two gold pieces on the\r\nmeagre palm, \"will you deign to follow me?\"\r\n\r\nHe led the way through the large folding doors and thence along the\r\nenfilade of gorgeous reception rooms, the corridors, landings and\r\nstaircase which Lydie herself had traversed just now. Gaston de\r\nStainville followed him at a close distance, acknowledging with a curt\r\nnod here and there the respectful salutations of the many lackeys whom\r\nhe passed.\r\n\r\nM. le Comte de Stainville was an important personage at Court: Madame\r\nde Pompadour's predilection for him was well known, and His Majesty\r\nhimself was passing fond of the gallant gentleman's company, whilst\r\nMadame la Comtesse was believed to hold undisputed sway over M. le\r\nContrôleur-Général des Finances.\r\n\r\nThus Gaston met with obsequiousness wherever he went, and this despite\r\nthe fact that he was not lavish with money. M. Durand would have\r\nexpected a much heavier bribe from any one else for this service which\r\nhe was now rendering to the Comte.\r\n\r\nAnon the two men reached the terrace. M. Durand then pointed with one\r\nclaw-like finger to the spinney on the left.\r\n\r\n\"M. le Comte will find Madame la Marquise in yonder plantation,\" he\r\nsaid; \"as for me, I dare not vacate my post any longer, for M. le\r\nContrôleur might have need of me, nor would Monsieur le Comte care\r\nmayhap to be seen by Madame la Marquise in my company.\"\r\n\r\nGaston assented. He was glad to be rid of the mealy-mouthed creature,\r\nof whose necessary help in this matter he was heartily ashamed. Unlike\r\nLydie, he was quite unconscious of the beauty of this August day:\r\nneither the birds nor the acrid scent of late summer flowers appealed\r\nto his fancy, and the clump of young beech trees only interested him\r\nin so far as he hoped to find Lydie there, alone.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the little glade, he caught sight of the graceful\r\nfigure, half-sitting, half-reclining in the unconscious charm of\r\nsleep. Overcome by the heat and the glare, Lydie had dozed off\r\nmomentarily.\r\n\r\nPresently something caused her to open her eyes and she saw Gaston de\r\nStainville standing there looking at her intently.\r\n\r\nShe was taken at a disadvantage, since she had undoubtedly been\r\nasleep--if only for a moment--and she was not quite sure if her pose,\r\nwhen Gaston first caught sight of her, was sufficiently dignified.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid I have disturbed you,\" he said humbly.\r\n\r\n\"I was meditating,\" she replied coldly, as she smoothed down her\r\nskirts and mechanically put a hand to her hair, lest a curl had gone\r\nastray.\r\n\r\nThen she made as if she would rise.\r\n\r\n\"Surely you are not going?\" he pleaded.\r\n\r\n\"I have my work to do. I only stayed here a moment, in order to rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I am intruding?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, scarcely,\" she replied quietly. \"I was about to return to my\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it so urgent?\"\r\n\r\n\"The business of a nation, M. le Comte, is always urgent.\"\r\n\r\n\"So urgent that you have no time now to give to old friends,\" he said\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders with a quick, sarcastic laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Old friends? . . . Oh! . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, old friends,\" he rejoined quietly. \"We were children together,\r\nLydie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Much has occurred since then, Monsieur le Comte.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only one great and awful fault, which meseems hath been its own\r\nexpiation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Need we refer to that now?\" she asked calmly.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, indeed, we must,\" he replied earnestly. \"Lydie, am I never to\r\nbe forgiven?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there aught for me to forgive?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. An error, a grave error . . . a fault, if you will call it so\r\n. . .\"\r\n\r\n\"I prefer to call it a treachery,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Without one word of explanation, without listening to a single word\r\nfrom me. Is that just?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing that you could say now, Monsieur le Comte, that I\r\nshould have the right to hear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so?\" he said with sudden vehemence, as he came nearer to her, and\r\nin a measure barred the way by which she might have escaped. \"Even a\r\ncriminal at point of death is allowed to say a few words in\r\nself-defence. Yet I was no criminal. If I loved you, Lydie, was that\r\nwrong? . . . I was an immeasurable fool, I own that,\" he added more\r\ncalmly, being quick to note that he only angered her by his violence,\r\n\"and it is impossible for a high-minded woman like yourself to\r\nunderstand the pitfalls which beset the path of a man, who has riches,\r\ngood looks mayhap and a great name, all of which will tempt the\r\ncupidity of certain designing women, bent above all on matrimony, on\r\ninfluence and independence. Into one of these pitfalls I fell, Lydie\r\n. . . fell clumsily, stupidly, I own, but not inexcusably.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to forget, M. le Comte,\" she said stiffly, \"that you are\r\nspeaking of your wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay!\" he said with a certain sad dignity, \"I try not to forget it. I\r\ndo not accuse, I merely state a fact, and do so before the woman whom\r\nI most honour in the world, who was the first recipient of my childish\r\nconfidences, the first consoler of my boyhood's sorrows.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was when you were free, M. le Comte, and could bring your\r\nconfidences to me; now they justly belong to another and . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"And by the heavens above me,\" he interrupted eagerly, \"I do that\r\nother no wrong by bringing my sorrows to you and laying them with a\r\nprayer for consolation at your feet.\"\r\n\r\nHe noted that since that first desire to leave him, Lydie had made no\r\nother attempt to go. She was sitting in the angle of the rough garden\r\nseat, her graceful arm resting on the back, her cheek leaning against\r\nher hand. A gentle breeze stirred the little curls round her head, and\r\nnow, when he spoke so earnestly and so sadly about his sorrow, a swift\r\nlook of sympathy softened the haughty expression of her mouth.\r\n\r\nQuick to notice it, Gaston nevertheless in no way relaxed his attitude\r\nof humble supplication; he stood before her with head bent, his eyes\r\nmostly riveted on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"There is so little consolation that I can give,\" she said more\r\ngently.\r\n\r\n\"There is a great one, if you will but try.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not cast me out from your life altogether. Am I such a despicable\r\ncreature that you cannot now and then vouchsafe me one kind look?\r\n. . . I did wrong you . . . I know it. . . . Call it treachery if you\r\nmust, yet when I look back on that night, meseems I am worthy of your\r\npity. Blinded by my overwhelming love for you, I forgot everything for\r\none brief hour . . . forgot that I had sunk deeply in a pitfall--by\r\nHeaven through no fault of mine own! . . . forgot that another now had\r\na claim on that love which never was mine to give, since it had always\r\nbeen wholly yours. . . . Yes! I forgot! . . . the music, the noise,\r\nthe excitement of the night, your own beauty, Lydie, momentarily\r\naddled my brain. . . . I forgot the past, I only lived for the\r\npresent. Am I to blame because I am a man and that you are exquisitely\r\nfair?\"\r\n\r\nHe forced himself not to raise his voice, not to appear eager or\r\nvehement. Lydie only saw before her a man whom she had once loved, who\r\nhad grievously wronged her, but who now stood before her ashamed and\r\nhumbled, asking with utmost respect for her forgiveness of the past.\r\n\r\n\"Let us speak of it no longer,\" she said, \"believe me, Gaston, I have\r\nnever borne you ill-will.\"\r\n\r\nFor the first time she had used his Christian name. The layer of ice\r\nwas broken through, but the surface of the lake was still cold and\r\nsmooth.\r\n\r\n\"Nay! but you avoid me,\" he rejoined seeking to meet her eyes, \"you\r\ntreat me with whole-hearted contempt, whilst I would lay down my life\r\nto serve you, and this in all deference and honour, as the martyrs of\r\nold laid down their life for their faith.\"\r\n\r\n\"Protestations, Gaston,\" she said with a quick sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Let me prove them true,\" he urged. \"Lydie, I watched you just now,\r\nwhile you slept; it was some minutes and I saw much. Your lips were\r\nparted with constant sighs; there were tears at the points of your\r\nlashes. At that moment I would have gladly died if thereby I could\r\nhave eased your heart from the obvious burden which it bore.\"\r\n\r\nEmboldened by her silence, and by the softer expression of her face,\r\nhe sat down close beside her, and anon placed his hand on hers. She\r\nwithdrew it quietly and serenely as was her wont, but quite without\r\nanger.\r\n\r\nShe certainly felt no anger toward him. Strangely enough, the anger\r\nshe did feel was all against her husband. That Gaston had seen her\r\ngrief was in a measure humiliating to her pride, and this humiliation\r\nshe owed to the great wrong done her by milor. And Gaston had been\r\nclever at choosing his words; he appealed to her pity and asked for\r\nforgiveness. There was no attempt on his part to justify himself, and\r\nhis self-abasement broke down the barrier of resentment which up to\r\nnow she had set up against him. His respectful homage soothed her\r\nwounded pride, and she felt really, sincerely sorry for him.\r\n\r\nThe fact that her own actions had been so gravely misunderstood also\r\nhelped Gaston's cause; she felt that, after all, she too might have\r\npassed a hasty, unconsidered judgment on him, and knew now how acutely\r\nsuch a judgment can hurt.\r\n\r\nAnd he spoke very earnestly, very simply: remember that she had loved\r\nhim once, loved and trusted him. He had been the ideal of her\r\ngirlhood, and though she had remorselessly hurled him down from his\r\nhigh pedestal since then, there remained nevertheless, somewhere in\r\nthe depths of her heart, a lingering thought of tenderness for him.\r\n\r\n\"Lydie!\" he now said appealingly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me be the means of easing your heart from its load of sorrow. You\r\nspoke of my wife just now. See, I do not shirk the mention of her\r\nname. I swear to you by that early love for you which was the noblest,\r\npurest emotion of my life, that I do not wrong her by a single thought\r\nwhen I ask for your friendship. You are so immeasurably superior to\r\nall other women, Lydie, that in your presence passion itself becomes\r\nexalted and desire transformed into a craving for sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! how I wish I could believe you, Gaston,\" she sighed.\r\n\r\n\"Try me!\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me guess what troubles you now. Oh! I am not the empty-headed fop\r\nthat you would believe. I have ears and eyes, and if I hold aloof from\r\nCourt intrigues, it is only because I see too much of their inner\r\nworkings. Do you really believe that I do not see what goes on around\r\nme now? Do I not know how your noble sympathy must at this very moment\r\nbe going out to the unfortunate young prince whom you honour with your\r\nfriendship? Surely, surely, you cannot be a party to the criminal\r\nsupineness which at this very moment besets France, and causes her to\r\nabandon him to his fate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not France, Gaston,\" she protested.\r\n\r\n\"And not you, surely. I would stake my life on your loyalty to a\r\nfriend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" she said simply.\r\n\r\n\"I knew it,\" he ejaculated triumphantly, as if this discovery had\r\nindeed caused him joyful surprise. \"Every fibre in my soul told me\r\nthat I would not appeal to you in vain. You are clever, Lydie, you are\r\nrich, you are powerful. I feel as if I could turn to you as to a man.\r\nPrince Charles Edward Stuart honoured me with his friendship: I am not\r\npresumptuous when I say that I stood in his heart second only to Lord\r\nEglinton. . . . But because I hold a secondary place I dared not\r\nthrust my advice, my prayers, my help forward, whilst I firmly\r\nbelieved that his greater friend was at work on his behalf. But now I\r\ncan bear the suspense no longer. The crisis has become over-acute. The\r\nStuart prince is in deadly danger, not only from supineness but from\r\ntreachery.\"\r\n\r\nClever Gaston! how subtle and how shrewd! she would never have to come\r\nto meet him on this ground, but he called to her. He came to fetch\r\nher, as it were, and led her along the road. He did not offer to guide\r\nher faltering footsteps, he simulated lameness, and asked for\r\nassistance instead of offering it.\r\n\r\nSo clever was this move that Lydie was thrown off her guard. At the\r\nword \"treachery\" she looked eagerly into his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"What makes you think . . . ?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I have scented it in the air for some days. The King himself\r\nwears an air of shamefacedness when the Stuart prince is mentioned.\r\nMadame de Pompadour lately hath talked freely of the completion of her\r\nchâteau in the Parc aux Cerfs, as if money were forthcoming from some\r\nunexpected source; then a letter came from England, which His Majesty\r\nkeeps hidden in his pocket, whilst whispered conversations are carried\r\non between the King and Madame, which cease abruptly if any one comes\r\nwithin earshot. Then to-day . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes? . . . to-day?\" she asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"I hardly dare speak of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear it might give you pain.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am used to pain,\" she said simply, \"and I would wish to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was in the antechamber when His Majesty arrived for _le petit\r\nlever_ of M. le Contrôleur. I had had vague hopes of seeing you this\r\nmorning, and lingered about the reception rooms somewhat listlessly,\r\nmy thoughts dwelling on all the sad news which has lately come from\r\nScotland. In the antechamber His Majesty was met by M. le Duc\r\nd'Aumont, your father.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused again as if loth to speak, but she said quite calmly:\r\n\r\n\"And you overheard something which the Duke, my father, said to the\r\nKing, and which confirmed your suspicions. What was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was His Majesty who spoke, obviously not aware that I was within\r\nearshot. He said quite airily: 'Oh! if we cannot persuade milor we\r\nmust act independently of him. The Stuart will be tired by now of\r\nliving in crags and will not be so chary of entrusting his valuable\r\nperson to a comfortable French ship.' Then M. le Duc placed a hand on\r\nHis Majesty's arm warning him of my presence and nothing more was\r\nsaid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you think that the King of France is about to deliver Prince\r\nCharles Edward Stuart to his enemies?\" she asked calmly.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure of it: and the thought is more than I can bear. And I am\r\nnot alone in this, Lydie. The whole of France will cry out in shame at\r\nsuch perfidy. Heaven knows what will come of it ultimately, but\r\nsurely, surely we cannot allow that unfortunate young prince whom we\r\nall loved and _fêted_ to be thus handed over to the English\r\nauthorities! That is why I have dared intrude on you to-day. Lydie,\"\r\nhe added now in a passionate appeal; \"for the sake of that noble if\r\nmisguided young prince, will you try and forget the terrible wrong\r\nwhich I in my madness and blindness once did you? Do not allow my sin\r\nto be expiated by him! . . . I crave your help for him on my knees.\r\n. . . Hate me an you will! despise me and punish me, but do not deny\r\nme your help for him!\"\r\n\r\nHis voice, though sunk now almost to a whisper, was vibrating with\r\npassion. He half dropped on his knees, took the edge of her skirt\r\nbetween his fingers and raised it to his lips.\r\n\r\nClever, clever Gaston! he had indeed moved her. Her serenity had gone,\r\nand her cold impassiveness. She sat up, erect, palpitating with\r\nexcitement, her eyes glowing, her lips parted, all her senses awake\r\nand thrilling with this unexpected hope.\r\n\r\n\"In what manner do you wish for my help, Gaston?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think the King and M. le Duc will do nothing for a day or two at\r\nany rate. I hoped I could forestall them, with your help, Lydie, if\r\nyou will give it. I am not rich, but I have realized some of my\r\nfortune: my intention was to charter a seaworthy boat, equip her as\r\nwell as my means allowed and start for Scotland immediately, and then\r\nif possible to induce the prince to cross over with me to Ireland, or,\r\nwith great good luck I might even bring him back as far as Brittany.\r\nBut you see how helpless I was, for I dared not approach you, and I do\r\nnot know where I can find the prince.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if I do not give you that help which you need?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I would still charter the vessel and start for Scotland,\" he replied\r\nquietly. \"I cannot stay here, in inactivity whilst I feel that\r\ninfamous treachery is being planned against a man with whom I have\r\noften broken bread. If you will not tell me where I can find Charles\r\nEdward Stuart, I will still equip a vessel and try and find him\r\nsomehow. If I fail, I will not return, but at any rate I shall then\r\nnot be a party or a witness to the everlasting shame of France!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your expedition would require great pluck and endurance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have both, and boundless enthusiasm to boot. Two or three friends\r\nwill accompany me, and my intention was to start for Brest or Le Havre\r\nto-night. But if you will consent to help me, Lydie . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay!\" she interrupted eagerly. \"I'll not help you. 'Tis you who shall\r\nhelp me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lydie!\"\r\n\r\n\"The plan which you have formed I too had thought on it: the treachery\r\nof the King of France, my God! I knew it too. But my plans are more\r\nmature than yours, less noble and self-sacrificing, for, as you say, I\r\nhave power and influence; yet with all that power I could not serve\r\nPrince Charles Edward as I would wish to do, because though I have\r\npluck and endurance I am not a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you want me to help you? Thank God! thank God for that! Tell me\r\nwhat to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"To start for Le Havre--not Brest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\"\r\n\r\n\"This afternoon . . . reaching Le Havre before dawn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"There to seek out _Le Monarque_. She lies in the harbour, and her\r\ncommander is Captain Barre.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! yes!\"\r\n\r\n\"You will hand him over a packet, which I will give you anon, and then\r\nreturn here as swiftly as you went.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\" he asked in obvious disappointment, \"and I who had\r\nhoped that you would ask me to give my life for you!\"\r\n\r\n\"The faithful and speedy performance of this errand, Gaston, is worth\r\nthe most sublime self-sacrifice, if this be purposeless. The packet\r\nwill contain full instructions for Captain Barre how and where to find\r\nPrince Charles Edward. _Le Monarque_ is ready equipped for the\r\nexpedition, but . . .\" she paused a moment as if half ashamed of the\r\nadmission, \"I had no one whom I could entrust with the message.\"\r\n\r\nGaston de Stainville was too keen a diplomatist to venture on this\r\ndelicate ground. He had never once mentioned her husband's name,\r\nfearing to scare her, or to sting her pride. He knew her to be far too\r\nloyal to allow condemnation of her lord by the lips of another man;\r\nall he said now was a conventional:\r\n\r\n\"I am ready!\"\r\n\r\nThen she rose and held out her hand to him. He bowed with great\r\ndeference, and kissed the tips of her fingers. His face expressed\r\nnothing but the respectful desire to be of service, and not one\r\nthought of treachery disturbed Lydie's serenity. Historians have, we\r\nknow, blamed her very severely for this unconditional yielding of\r\nanother's secret into the keeping of a man who had already deceived\r\nher once; but it was the combination of circumstances which caused her\r\nto act thus, and Gaston's masterly move in asking for her help had\r\ncompletely subjugated her. She would have yielded to no other emotion,\r\nbut that of compassion for him, and the desire to render him\r\nassistance in a cause which she herself had so deeply at heart. She\r\nhad no love for Gaston and no amount of the usual protestations would\r\nhave wrung a confidence from her. But he had so turned the tables that\r\nit appeared that he was confiding in her; and her pride, which had\r\nbeen so deeply humiliated that self-same morning, responded to his\r\nappeal. If she had had the least doubt or fear in her mind, she would\r\nnot have given up her secret, but as he stood so coldly and\r\nimpassively before her, without a trace of passion in his voice or\r\nlook, she had absolutely no misgivings.\r\n\r\n\"I can be in the saddle at four o'clock,\" he said in the same\r\nunemotional tones, \"when and how can I receive the packet from you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you wait for me here?\" she replied. \"The packet is quite ready,\r\nand the walls of the palace have eyes and ears.\"\r\n\r\nThus they parted. She full of confidence and hope, not in any way\r\nattempting to disguise before him the joy and gratitude which she\r\nfelt, he the more calm of the two, fearing to betray his sense of\r\ntriumph, still trembling lest her present mood should change.\r\n\r\nHer graceful figure quickly disappeared among the trees. He gave a\r\nsigh of intense satisfaction. His Majesty would be pleased, and Madame\r\nde Pompadour would be more than kind. Never for a moment did the least\r\nfeeling of remorse trouble his complacent mind; the dominant thought\r\nin him was one of absolute triumph and pride at having succeeded in\r\nhoodwinking the keenest statesman in France. He sat down on the garden\r\nseat whereon had been fought that close duel between himself and the\r\nwoman whom he had once already so heartlessly betrayed. He thought\r\nover every stage of the past scene and smiled somewhat grimly. He felt\r\nquite sure that he individually would never have trusted for the\r\nsecond time a woman who had once deceived him. But Lydie had no such\r\nmisgivings; as she now sped through the park, she no longer saw its\r\nartificiality, its stunted rose trees and the stultified plantations.\r\nThe air was invigorating to breathe, the fragrance of the flowers was\r\nsweet, the birds' twitter was delicious to the ear. There were good\r\nand beautiful things in this world, but the best of all was the\r\nloyalty of a friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nA CRISIS\r\n\r\n\r\nLydie returned to the palace in a very different frame of mind than\r\nwhen, half an hour ago, she had run along corridor and staircase, her\r\nnerves on the jar, her whole being smarting under the sense of wrong\r\nand of injustice.\r\n\r\nHope had consoled her since then, and the thought that her own\r\ncherished plan need not fail for want of a loyal man's help had in a\r\nmeasure eased that strange obsession which had weighed on her heart,\r\nand caused foolish tears to start to her eyes. She was also conscious\r\nof a certain joy in thinking that the companion of her childhood, the\r\nman who had been her earliest ideal was not so black a traitor as she\r\nhad believed.\r\n\r\nGaston had spoken of pitfalls, he owned to having been deceived, and\r\nthere is no woman living who will not readily admit that her\r\nsuccessful rival is naught but a designing minx. Gaston had always\r\nbeen weak where women were concerned, and Lydie forgave him his\r\nweakness, simply because he had owned to it and because she liked to\r\nthink of his fault as a weakness rather than as a deliberate\r\ntreachery.\r\n\r\nNow she only thought of her project. When first she had talked of\r\ncommissioning _Le Monarque_, milor had entrusted her with all\r\nnecessary directions by which Captain Barre could most easily reach\r\nthe Stuart prince and his friends. It was but a very few weeks, nay\r\ndays ago, that she had been quite convinced that the King himself\r\nwould be foremost in the general desire to fit out an expedition for\r\nthe rescue of the unfortunate Jacobites, and naturally the fitting-out\r\nof such an expedition would have been entrusted primarily to herself\r\nand incidentally to her husband.\r\n\r\nThese directions she still had. All she had to do now was to embody\r\nthem in the secret orders which Gaston de Stainville would hand over\r\nto the Commander of _Le Monarque_. Further orders would be anent\r\ngetting the prince and his friends on board, and the route to be taken\r\nhomeward, the better to ensure their safety.\r\n\r\nBeyond that she would need some sort of token which, when shown to\r\nCharles Edward Stuart by Captain Barre, would induce the young prince\r\nto trust himself and his friends unconditionally to _Le Monarque_.\r\nLord Eglinton's signet ring had been spoken of for this object the day\r\nof the Young Pretender's departure, but now of course she could not\r\nask milor for it. On the other hand she felt quite sure that a written\r\nword from her would answer the necessary purpose, a brief note sealed\r\nwith the Eglinton arms.\r\n\r\nThe thought of the seal as an additional message of good faith first\r\noccurred to her when she once more reached the West Wing of the\r\npalace.\r\n\r\nFrom the great square landing where she now stood, a monumental door\r\non her right gave on her own suite of apartments. On the left was the\r\nlong enfilade of reception rooms, with the vast audience chamber and\r\nmilor's own withdrawing room beyond.\r\n\r\nShe deliberately turned to the left, and once more traversed the vast\r\nand gorgeous halls where, half an hour ago, she had suffered such keen\r\nhumiliation and such overwhelming disappointment. She forced herself\r\nnot to dwell on that scene again, and even closed her eyes with a\r\nvague fear that the mental vision might become materialized.\r\n\r\nBeyond the audience chamber there were two or three more reception\r\nrooms, and from the last of these a door masked by a heavy portière,\r\ngave on milor's study. All these apartments were now deserted, save\r\nfor a few flunkeys who stood about desultorily in the window\r\nembrasures. From one of them Lydie asked if M. le Contrôleur des\r\nFinances was within, but no one remembered having seen milor since the\r\n_petit lever_, and it was generally thought that he had gone to\r\nTrianon. Lydie hesitated a moment before she opened the door; she\r\nscarcely ever entered this portion of the palace and had never once\r\nbeen in milor's private rooms. But she wanted that seal with the\r\nEglinton arms, and would not admit, even to herself, that her\r\nhusband's presence or absence interested her in the least.\r\n\r\nBut on the threshold she paused. Milor was sitting at a gigantic\r\nescritoire placed squarely in front of the window. He had obviously\r\nbeen writing; at the slight sound of the creaking door and the swish\r\nof Lydie's skirts, he raised his head from his work and turned to look\r\nat her.\r\n\r\nImmediately he rose.\r\n\r\n\"Your pardon for this intrusion, milor,\" she said coldly, \"your\r\nlacqueys gave me to understand that you were from home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything that you desire?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only a seal with the Eglinton arms,\" she replied quite casually, \"I\r\nhave need of it for a private communication.\"\r\n\r\nHe sought for the seal among the many costly objects which littered\r\nhis table and handed it to her.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry that you should have troubled to come so far for it,\" he\r\nsaid coldly, \"one of my men would have taken it to your study.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I am sorry that I should have disturbed you,\" she rejoined. \"I\r\nwas told that you had gone to Trianon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be on my way thither in a few moments, to place my\r\nresignation in the hands of His Majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your resignation?\"\r\n\r\n\"As I have had the honour to tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you will leave Versailles?\"\r\n\r\n\"To make way for my successor, as soon as His Majesty hath appointed\r\none.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you go . . . whither?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! what matter?\" he replied carelessly, \"so long as I no longer\r\ntrouble your ladyship with my presence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you will have no objection if I return to my father until your\r\nfuture plans are more mature?\"\r\n\r\n\"Objection?\" he said with a pleasant little laugh. \"Nay, Madame, you\r\nare pleased to joke.\"\r\n\r\nShe felt a little bewildered: this unexpected move on his part had\r\nsomehow thrown all her plans out of gear. For the moment she scarcely\r\nhad time to conjecture, even vaguely, what her own future actions\r\nwould be if her husband no longer chose to hold an important position\r\nin the Ministry. The thought that his resignation would of necessity\r\nmean her own, suddenly rushed into her mind with overwhelming\r\nviolence, but she was too confused at present to disentangle herself\r\nfrom the maze of conflicting emotions which assailed her, when first\r\nshe realized the unexpected possibility.\r\n\r\nShe was toying with the seal, forgetful somehow of the purpose and the\r\nplans which it represented. These not being in jeopardy through\r\nmilor's extraordinary conduct, she could afford to dismiss them from\r\nher mind.\r\n\r\nIt was the idea of her husband's resignation and her own future which\r\ntroubled her, and strangely enough there was such an air of finality\r\nabout his attitude that, for the moment, she was somewhat at a loss\r\nhow to choose a line of argument with which to influence him. That she\r\ncould make him alter his decision she never doubted for a moment, but\r\nsince the first day of their married life he had never taken any\r\ninitiative in an important matter, and his doing so at this moment\r\nfound her at first wholly unprepared.\r\n\r\n\"Am I to understand that my wishes in so vital a decision are not to\r\nbe consulted in any way?\" she asked after a momentary pause.\r\n\r\n\"You will honour me, Madame, by making me acquainted with them,\" he\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n\"You must reconsider your resignation,\" she said decisively.\r\n\r\n\"That is not possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have much important business of the nation in hand which I could\r\nnot hand over to your successor in an incomplete state,\" she said\r\nhaughtily.\r\n\r\n\"There is no necessity for that, Madame, nor for depriving the nation\r\nof your able, guiding hand. The post of Comptroller of Finance need\r\nnot be filled immediately. It can remain in abeyance and under your\r\nown matchless control, at the pleasure of His Majesty and M. le Duc\r\nd'Aumont, neither of whom will, I am sure, desire to make a change in\r\nan administration, which is entirely for the benefit of France.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him very keenly, through narrowed lids scanning his face\r\nand trying to read his intent. But there was obviously no look of\r\nsarcasm in his eyes, nor the hint of a sneer in the even placidity of\r\nhis voice. Once more that unaccountable feeling of irritation seemed\r\nto overmaster her, the same sense of wrath and of injustice which had\r\nassailed her when she first spoke to him.\r\n\r\n\"But this is senseless, milor,\" she said impatiently. \"You seem to\r\nforget that I am your wife, and that I have a right to your\r\nprotection, and to a fitting home if I am to leave Versailles.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not forgetting that you are my wife, Madame, but my protection\r\nis worth so little, scarcely worthy of your consideration. As for the\r\nrest, my château of Vincennes is entirely at your disposal; a retinue\r\nof servants is there awaiting your orders, and my notary will this day\r\nprepare the deed which I have commanded wherein I humbly ask you to\r\naccept the château, its lands and revenues as a gift from me, albeit\r\nthese are wholly unworthy of your condescension.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is monstrous, milor, and I'll not accept it,\" she retorted. \"Think\r\nyou perchance I am so ready to play the _rôle_ of a forsaken wife?\"\r\n\r\nA strange thought had been gradually creeping into her mind: a weird\r\nkind of calculation whereby she put certain events in juxtaposition to\r\none another: the departure of Gaston de Stainville, for he had told\r\nher that he was prepared to go to Scotland whether she helped him in\r\nhis expedition or not: then Irène would be temporarily free, almost a\r\nwidow since Gaston's return under those circumstances would have been\r\nmore than problematical; and now milor calmly expressing the\r\ndetermination to quit Versailles, and to give away his château and\r\nlands of Vincennes, forsooth, as a sop to the forsaken wife, whilst\r\nMadame de Stainville's provocative attitude this morning more than\r\nbore out this conclusion.\r\n\r\nLydie felt as if every drop of blood in her body rushed up violently\r\nto her cheeks, which suddenly blazed with anger, whilst his, at her\r\nsuggestion, had become a shade more pale.\r\n\r\n\"I am free to suppose, milor, that Madame de Stainville has something\r\nto do with your sudden decision!\" she said haughtily; \"therefore,\r\nbelieve me, I have no longer a wish to combat it. As the welfare of\r\nFrance, the work which I have in hand, interests you so little, I will\r\nnot trouble you by referring to such matters again. By all means place\r\nyour resignation in His Majesty's hands. I understand that you desire\r\nto be free. I only hope that you will assist me in not washing too\r\nmuch of our matrimonial linen in public. I have many enemies and I\r\nmust refuse to allow your whims and fantasies to annihilate the fruits\r\nof my past labours, for the good of my country. I will confer with\r\nMonsieur le Duc, my father; you will hear my final decision from him.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned once more toward the door. He had not spoken one word in\r\ninterruption, as with a harsh and trenchant voice she thus hurled\r\ninsult upon insult at him. She only saw that he looked very pale,\r\nalthough his face seemed to her singularly expressionless: whilst she\r\nherself was conscious of such unendurable agony, that she feared she\r\nmust betray it in the quiver of her mouth, and the tears which\r\nthreatened to come to her eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen she ceased speaking, he bowed quite stiffly, but made no sign of\r\nwishing to defend himself. She left the room very hurriedly: in\r\nanother second and she would have broken down. Sobs were choking her,\r\nan intolerable anguish wrung her heartstrings to that extent, that if\r\nshe had had the power, she would have wounded him physically, as she\r\nhoped that she had done now mentally. Oh! if she had had the strength,\r\nif those sobs that would not be denied had not risen so persistently\r\nin her throat, she would have found words of such deadly outrage, as\r\nwould at least have stung him and made him suffer as she was suffering\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nThere are certain pains of the heart that are so agonizing, that only\r\ncruelty will assuage them. Lydie's strong, passionate nature\r\nperpetually held in check by the force of her great ambition and by\r\nher will to be masculine and firm in the great purpose of her life,\r\nhad for once broken through the trammels which her masterful mind had\r\nfashioned round it. It ran riot now in her entire being. She was\r\nconscious of overwhelming, of indomitable hate.\r\n\r\nWith burning eyes and trembling lips she hurried through the rooms,\r\nand along the interminable corridors. The flunkeys stared at her as\r\nshe passed, she looked so different to her usual composed and haughty\r\nself: her cheeks were flaming, her bosom heaving beneath the\r\nprimly-folded kerchief, and at intervals a curious moan-like sound\r\nescaped her lips.\r\n\r\nThus she reached her own study, a small square room at the extreme end\r\nof the West Wing, two of its walls formed an angle of the structure,\r\nwith great casement windows which gave on that secluded spinney, with\r\nits peaceful glade which she loved.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she entered the room her eyes fell on that distant beech\r\nplantation. A great sigh rose from her oppressed heart, for suddenly\r\nshe had remembered her great purpose, the one project which was\r\ninfinitely dear to her.\r\n\r\nThe graceful beech trees far away, with their undergrowth of bracken\r\nand foxgloves gleaming in the sun, recalled to her that Gaston was\r\nwaiting in their midst for her message to _Le Monarque_.\r\n\r\nThank God, this great joy at least was not denied her. She still had\r\nthe power and the will to accomplish this all-pervading object of her\r\nlife: the rescue of the Stuart prince from the hands of his enemies\r\nand from the perfidy of his whilom friends.\r\n\r\nThis thought, the recollection of her talk with Gaston, the work which\r\nstill remained for her to do, eased the tension of her nerves and\r\nstilled the agonizing pain of her heart.\r\n\r\nWith a tremendous effort of will she chased away from her mental\r\nvision the picture of that pale, expressionless face, which seemed to\r\nhaunt her. She forced herself to forget the humiliation, the\r\ninjustice, the affront which she had suffered to-day, and not to hear\r\nthe persistent echo of the deadly insults which she had uttered in\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\nHer study was cool and dark; heavy curtains of soft-toned lavender\r\nfell beside the windows, partially shutting out the glare of the\r\nmidday sun. Her secretaire stood in the centre of the room. She sat\r\ndown near it and unlocked a secret drawer. For the next quarter of an\r\nhour her pen flew across two sheets of paper. She had in front of her\r\na map of a certain portion of the West Coast of Scotland, with\r\ndirections and other sundry notes carefully written in the margins,\r\nand she was writing out the orders for the commander of _Le Monarque_\r\nto reach that portion of the coast as quickly as possible, to seek out\r\nPrince Charles Stuart, who would probably be on the look-out for a\r\nFrench vessel, and having got him, and as many friends of his as\r\naccompanied him, safely aboard, to skirt the West Coast of Ireland and\r\nsubsequently to reach Morlaix in Brittany, where the prince would\r\ndisembark.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing flustered or undetermined about her actions, she\r\nnever paused a moment to collect her thoughts for obedient to her will\r\nthey were already arrayed in perfect order in her mind: she had only\r\nto transfer them to paper.\r\n\r\nHaving written out the orders for Captain Barre she carefully folded\r\nthem, together with the map, and fastened and sealed them with the\r\nofficial seal of the Ministry of Finance: then she took one more sheet\r\nof paper and wrote in a bold clear hand:\r\n\r\n      \"The bearer of this letter is sent to meet you by your\r\n      true and faithful friends. You may trust yourself and\r\n      those you care for unconditionally to him.\"\r\n\r\nTo this note she affixed a seal stamped with the Eglinton arms: and\r\nacross the words themselves she wrote the name \"Eglinton!\"\r\n\r\nThere was no reason to fear for a moment that the Stuart prince would\r\nhave any misgivings when he received this message of comfort and of\r\nhope.\r\n\r\nThen with all the papers safely tied together and hidden in the folds\r\nof her corselet, she once more found her way down the great staircase\r\nand terraces and into the beech wood where M. de Stainville awaited\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nA FAREWELL\r\n\r\n\r\nGaston de Stainville had been sitting idly on the garden seat, vaguely\r\nwondering why Lydie was so long absent, ignorant of course of the\r\nacute crisis through which she had just passed. For the last quarter\r\nof an hour of this weary waiting, anxiety began to assail him.\r\n\r\nWomen were so fickle and so capricious! which remark inwardly muttered\r\ncame with singular inappropriateness from Gaston de Stainville. His\r\nkeen judgment, however, fought his apprehensions. He knew quite well\r\nthat Lydie was unlike other women, at once stronger and weaker than\r\nthose of her own sex, more firm in her purpose, less bendable in her\r\nobstinacy. And he knew also that nothing could occur within the\r\ngorgeous walls of that palace to cause her to change her mind.\r\n\r\nBut as the moments sped on, his anxiety grew apace. He no longer could\r\nsit still, and began walking feverishly up and down the little glade,\r\nlike an animal caged within limits too narrow for its activity. He\r\ndared not wander out of the wood, lest she should return and, not\r\nfinding him there, think at once of doubting.\r\n\r\nThus when she once more appeared before him, he was not so calm as he\r\nwould have wished, nor yet so keen in noting the subtle, indefinable\r\nchange which had come over her entire personality. Desirous of masking\r\nhis agitation, he knelt when she approached, and thus took the packet\r\nfrom her hand.\r\n\r\nThe action struck her as theatrical, her mind being filled with\r\nanother picture, that of a man motionless and erect, with pale,\r\nexpressionless face, which yet had meant so much more of reality to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAnd because of this theatricality in Gaston's attitude, she lost\r\nsomething of the fullness of joy of this supreme moment. She ought to\r\nhave been happier, more radiant with hope for the future and with\r\ngratitude to him. She tried to say something enthusiastic, something\r\nmore in keeping with the romance of this sudden and swift departure,\r\nthe prospective ride to Le Havre, the spirit of self-sacrifice and\r\ncourage which caused him to undertake this task, so different to his\r\nusual avocation of ease and luxury.\r\n\r\n\"I pray you, Gaston,\" she said, \"guard the packet safely, and use your\r\nbest endeavours to reach Le Havre ere the night hath yielded to a new\r\ndawn.\"\r\n\r\nShe could not say more just now, feeling that if she added words of\r\nencouragement or of praise, they would not ring true, and would seem\r\nas artificial as his posture at her feet.\r\n\r\n\"I will guard the packet with my life,\" he said earnestly, \"and if\r\nperchance you wake to-night from dreams of the unfortunate prince,\r\nwhom your devotion will save from death, send one thought wandering\r\nfar away across the rich fields of Normandy, for they will be behind\r\nme by that time, and I will sight the port of Le Havre long before its\r\nchurch spires are tipped with gold.\"\r\n\r\n\"God speed you then!\" she rejoined. \"I'll not detain you!\"\r\n\r\nShe chided herself for her coldness, noting that Gaston on the other\r\nhand seemed aglow now with excitement, as he unbuttoned his coat and\r\nslipped the papers into an inner pocket. Then he sprang to his feet\r\nand seemed ready to go.\r\n\r\nJust at the moment of actual parting, when he asked for her hand to\r\nkiss, and she, giving it to him felt his lips trembling on her\r\nfingers, some measure of his excitement communicated itself to her,\r\nand she repeated more warmly:\r\n\r\n\"God speed you, Gaston, and farewell!\"\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, Lydie, for this trust which you have deigned to place\r\nin me! Two days hence at even I shall have returned. Where shall I see\r\nyou then?\"\r\n\r\n\"In my study. Ask for an audience. I will see that it is granted.\"\r\n\r\nThe next moment he had gone; she saw the rich purple of his coat\r\ngradually vanish behind the tall bracken. Even then she had no\r\nmisgivings. She thought that she had done right, and that she had\r\ntaken the only course by which she could ensure the safety of the\r\nStuart prince, to whom France, whom she guided through the tortuous\r\npaths of diplomacy, and for whose honour she felt herself to be\r\nprimarily responsible, had pledged her word and her faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nROYAL THANKS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one of the smaller rooms of the palace of Trianon, His Majesty King\r\nLouis XV received M. le Comte de Stainville in private audience.\r\nMadame la Marquise de Pompadour was present. She sat in an armchair,\r\nclose beside the one occupied by His Majesty, her dainty feet resting\r\non a footstool, her hand given up to her royal patron, so that he\r\nmight occasionally imprint a kiss upon it.\r\n\r\nGaston de Stainville sat on a tabouret at a respectful distance. He\r\nhad in his hand a letter with a seal attached to it and a map, which\r\nhad a number of notes scribbled in the margin. His Majesty seemed in a\r\nsuperlatively good humour, and sat back in his chair, his fat body\r\nshaking now and again with bursts of merriment.\r\n\r\n\"Eh! eh! this gallant Count!\" he said jovially, \"par ma foi! to think\r\nthat the minx deceived us and our Court all these years, with her prim\r\nways and prudish manner. Even Her Majesty the Queen looks upon Madame\r\nLydie as a pattern of all the virtues.\"\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward and beckoned to Gaston to draw his chair nearer.\r\n\r\n\"Voyons, M. le Comte,\" continued Louis with a humorous leer, \"there is\r\nno need for quite so much discretion. We are all friends together\r\n. . . eh? Tell us how you did it.\"\r\n\r\nGaston de Stainville did draw his chair nearer to His Majesty, such a\r\nproffered honour was not to be ignored. His face wore an air of\r\nprovocative discretion and a fatuous smile curled his sensual lips.\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" he said unctuously, \"your Majesty who is _galant homme_ par\r\nexcellence will deign to grant me leave to keep inviolate the secret\r\nof how I succeeded in breaking through the barrier of prudery, set up\r\nby the most unapproachable woman in France. Enough that I did succeed:\r\nand that I have been made thrice happy by being allowed to place the\r\nresult, with mine own hands, at the feet of the most adored of her\r\nsex.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with an elegant and graceful flourish of the arm, he rose from his\r\ntabouret and immediately dropped on one knee at Madame's feet,\r\noffering her the letter and the map which he held. She took them from\r\nhim, regarding him with a smile, which fortunately the amorous but\r\nhighly jealous monarch failed to see; he had just taken the papers\r\nfrom Pompadour and was gloating over their contents.\r\n\r\n\"You had best see M. le Duc d'Aumont at once,\" said His Majesty with a\r\nquick return to gravity, as soon as Gaston de Stainville had once more\r\nresumed his seat. \"Go back to the palace now, Monsieur le Comte,\r\nMadame will allow you to take her chair, and then by using our own\r\nprivate entrance on the South side, you will avoid being seen from the\r\nWest Wing. Needless to say, I hope, that discretion and wariness must\r\nbe your watchword until the affair is brought to a successful\r\nconclusion.\"\r\n\r\nGaston de Stainville bent himself nearly double, and placed one hand\r\nthere, where his heart was supposed to be, all in token that he would\r\nbe obedient to the letter and the spirit of every royal command.\r\n\r\n\"We do not think,\" said Louis, with somewhat forced carelessness,\r\n\"that our subjects need know anything about this transaction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not, Sire,\" rejoined De Stainville most emphatically,\r\nwhilst Madame too nodded very decisively.\r\n\r\n\"Most people have strange ideas about politics and diplomacy,\"\r\ncontinued the King. \"Just as if those complicated arts could be\r\nconducted on lines of antiquated mediæval codes: therefore the whole\r\nbusiness must be kept between our three selves now present, M. le\r\nComte, and of course M. le Duc d'Aumont, who has helped us throughout,\r\nand without whom we could not now proceed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I quite understand, Sire,\" assented Gaston.\r\n\r\n\"We are of course presuming that your happy influence over Madame\r\nLydie will not cease with her giving you those papers,\" said Louis\r\nwith another of his unpleasant leers.\r\n\r\n\"I think not your Majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"She will hold her tongue, I should imagine . . . for very obvious\r\nreasons,\" said Madame with a malicious sneer.\r\n\r\n\"Anyhow you had best make our recommendations known to Monsieur le Duc\r\nd'Aumont. Tell him that we suggest not relying on _Le Monarque_ even\r\nthough she be ready to put to sea, as her commander may be, for aught\r\nwe know a secret adherent of the Stuart. We should not care to trust\r\nhim, since the Eglintons seem to have been already to do so. A delay\r\nof five or six days while _Le Levantin_ is being commissioned is\r\nbetter than the taking of any risk. Though we are doing nothing that\r\nwe are ashamed of,\" added Louis the Well-beloved airily, \"we have no\r\nwish that the matter be bruited abroad, lest we be misunderstood.\"\r\n\r\nWe must suppose that Monsieur le Comte de Stainville had been denied\r\nat his birth the saving gift of a sense of humour, for in reply to\r\nthis long tirade from the King, he said quite seriously and\r\nemphatically:\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty need not be under the slightest apprehension. Neither M.\r\nle Duc d'Aumont, I feel sure, nor I myself will in any way endanger\r\nthe absolute secrecy of the transaction, lest we be misunderstood. As\r\nfor Madame Lydie . . .\" He paused a moment, whilst carefully examining\r\nhis well-trimmed nails: a smile, wherein evil intent now fought with\r\nfatuity, played round the corners of his lips. \"Madame Lydie will also\r\nhold her tongue,\" he concluded quietly.\r\n\r\n\"That is well!\" assented the King. \"M. le Duc d'Aumont will see to the\r\nrest. In five or six days, _Le Levantin_ should be ready. Her secret\r\norders have been drafted and already bear our royal signature. Now\r\nwith this map and directions, and the private note for the Stuart, all\r\nso kindly furnished by Madame Lydie, the expedition should be easy,\r\nand above all quite swift. The sooner the affair is concluded and the\r\nmoney paid over, the less likelihood there is of our subjects getting\r\nwind thereof. We must stipulate, M. le Comte, since you are the\r\nyoungest partner in this undertaking and the least prominent in the\r\npublic eye, that you take the secret orders yourself to _Le Levantin_.\r\nWe should not feel safe if they were in any one else's hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank your Majesty for this trust.\"\r\n\r\n\"For this special task, and for your work this afternoon, you shall be\r\nrewarded with two out of the fifteen millions promised by His Grace of\r\nCumberland. M. le Duc d'Aumont will receive three, whilst we shall\r\nhave the honour and pleasure of laying the remainder at the feet of\r\nMadame la Marquise de Pompadour.\"\r\n\r\nHe cast an amorous glance at Madame, who promptly rewarded him with a\r\ngracious smile.\r\n\r\n\"I think that is all which we need say for the present M. le Comte,\"\r\nconcluded His Majesty; \"within six days from now you should be on your\r\nway to Brest where _Le Levantin_ should by then be waiting her orders\r\nand ready to put to sea. A month later, if wind, weather and\r\ncircumstances favour us, that young adventurer will have been handed\r\nover to the English authorities and we, who had worked out the\r\ndifficult diplomatic problems so carefully, will have shared between\r\nus the English millions.\"\r\n\r\nWith his habitual airy gesture, Louis now intimated that the audience\r\nwas at an end. He was obviously more highly elated than he cared to\r\nshow before Gaston, and was longing to talk over plans and projects\r\nfor future pleasures and extravagances with the fair Marquise. Madame,\r\nwho had the knack of conveying a great deal by a look, succeeded in\r\nintimating to Gaston that she would gladly have availed herself a\r\nlittle longer of his pleasant company, but that royal commands must\r\nprevail.\r\n\r\nGaston therefore rose and kissed each hand, as it was graciously\r\nextended to him.\r\n\r\n\"We are pleased with what you have done, Monsieur le Comte,\" said the\r\nKing as M. de Stainville finally took his leave, \"but tell me,\" he\r\nwhispered slily, \"did the unapproachable Lydie yield with the first\r\nkiss, or did she struggle much? . . . eh? . . . B-r-r . . . my dear\r\nComte, are your lips not frozen by contact with such an icicle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, your Majesty! all icicles are bound to melt sooner or later!\"\r\nsaid Gaston de Stainville with a smile which--had Lydie seen it--would\r\nhave half killed her with shame.\r\n\r\nAnd with that same smile of fatuity still lurking round his lips, he\r\nbowed himself out of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nPATERNAL ANXIETY\r\n\r\n\r\nM. le Duc d'Aumont, Prime Minister of His Majesty King Louis XV of\r\nFrance, was exceedingly perturbed. He had just had two separate\r\ninterviews, each of half an hour's duration, and he was now busy\r\ntrying to dissociate what his daughter had told him in the first\r\ninterview, from that which M. de Stainville had imparted to him in the\r\nsecond. And he was not succeeding.\r\n\r\nThe two sets of statements seemed inextricably linked together.\r\n\r\nLydie, certainly had been very strange and agitated in her manner,\r\ntotally unlike herself: but this mood of course, though so very\r\nunusual in her, did not astonish M. le Duc so much, once he realized\r\nits cause.\r\n\r\nIt was the cause which was so singularly upsetting.\r\n\r\nMilor Eglinton, his son-in-law, had sent in his resignation as\r\nComptroller-General of Finance, and this without giving any reason for\r\nso sudden and decisive a step. At any rate Lydie herself professed to\r\nbe ignorant of milor's motives for this extraordinary line of action\r\nas she was of his future purpose. All she knew--or all that she cared\r\nto tell her father--was that her husband had avowedly the intention of\r\ndeserting her: he meant to quit Versailles immediately, thus vacating\r\nhis post without a moment's notice, and leaving his wife, whom he had\r\nallowed to conduct all State affairs for him for over a year, to\r\nextricate herself, out of a tangle of work and an anomalous position,\r\nas best she might.\r\n\r\nThe only suggestion which milor had cared to put forward, with regard\r\nto her future, was that he was about to make her a free gift of his\r\nchâteau and lands of Vincennes, the yearly revenues of which were\r\nclose upon a million livres. This gift she desired not to accept.\r\n\r\nIn spite of strenuous and diplomatic efforts on his part, M. le Duc\r\nd'Aumont had been unable to obtain any further explanation of these\r\nextraordinary events from his daughter. Lydie had no intention\r\nwhatever of deceiving her father and she had given him what she\r\nbelieved to be a perfectly faithful _exposé_ of the situation. All\r\nthat she had kept back from him was the immediate cause of the grave\r\nmisunderstanding between herself and her husband, and we must do her\r\nthe justice to state that she did not think that this was relevant to\r\nthe ultimate issue.\r\n\r\nMoreover, she was more than loath to mention the Stuart prince and his\r\naffairs again before M. le Duc. She knew that he was not in sympathy\r\nwith her over this matter and she dreaded to know with absolute\r\ncertainty that there was projected treachery afoot, and that he\r\nperhaps would have a hand in it. What Gaston de Stainville had\r\nconjectured, had seen and overheard, what she herself had guessed, was\r\nnot to her mind quite conclusive as far as her father's share in the\r\nscheme was concerned.\r\n\r\nShe was deeply attached to her father, and her heart found readily\r\nenough a sufficiency of arguments which exonerated him from actual\r\nparticipation in such wanton perfidy. At any rate in this instance she\r\nchose ignorance rather than heartrending certainty, and as by her\r\nquick action and Gaston's timely and unexpected help, the actual\r\ntreachery would be averted, she preferred to dismiss her father's\r\nproblematical participation in it entirely from her mind.\r\n\r\nThus she told him nothing of milor's attitude with regard to the Duke\r\nof Cumberland's letter; in fact, she never once referred to the letter\r\nor to the Young Pretender; she merely gave M. le Duc to understand\r\nthat her husband seemed desirous of living his future life altogether\r\napart from hers.\r\n\r\nM. le Duc d'Aumont was sorely disquieted: two eventualities presented\r\nthemselves before him, and both were equally distasteful. One was the\r\nscandal which would of necessity spread around his daughter's name the\r\nmoment her matrimonial differences with her husband became generally\r\nknown. M. le Duc d'Aumont was too well acquainted with this Court of\r\nVersailles not to realize that Lydie's position, as a neglected wife,\r\nwould subject her to a series of systematic attentions, which she\r\ncould but regard in the light of insults.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand M. le Duc could not even begin to think of having to\r\nforego his daughter's help in the various matters relating to his own\r\nadministration. He had been accustomed for some years now to consult\r\nher in all moments of grave crises, to rely on her judgment, on her\r\nable guidance, worth ten thousand times more to him than an army of\r\nmasculine advisers.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the repeated sneers hurled at this era of \"petticoat\r\ngovernment,\" Lydie had been of immense service to him, and if she were\r\nsuddenly to be withdrawn from his official life, he would feel very\r\nlike Louis XIII had done on that memorable Journée des Dupes, when\r\nRichelieu left him for twenty-four hours to conduct the affairs of\r\nState alone. He would not have known where to begin.\r\n\r\nBut Lydie told him that her decision was irrevocable, or what was more\r\nto the point, milor had left her no alternative: his resignation was\r\nby now in His Majesty's hands, and he had not even suggested that\r\nLydie should accompany him, when he quitted Versailles, in order to\r\ntake up life as a private gentleman.\r\n\r\nIt was all very puzzling and very difficult. M. le Duc d'Aumont\r\nstrongly deprecated the idea of his daughter vacating her official\r\npost, because of this sudden caprice of milor. He had need of her, and\r\nso had France, and the threads of national business could not be\r\nsnapped in a moment. The post of Comptroller-General of Finance could\r\nremain in abeyance for awhile. After that one would see.\r\n\r\nThen with regard to the proposed gifts of the château and revenues of\r\nVincennes, M. le Duc d'Aumont would not hear of a refusal. Madame la\r\nMarquise d'Eglinton must have a private establishment worthy of her\r\nrank, and an occasional visit from milor would help to keep up an\r\noutward appearance of decorum, and to throw dust in the eyes of the\r\nscandal-mongers.\r\n\r\nThe interview with his daughter had upset M. le Duc d'Aumont very\r\nconsiderably. The whole thing had been so unexpected: it was difficult\r\nto imagine his usually so impassive and yielding son-in-law displaying\r\nany initiative of his own. M. le Duc was still puzzling over the\r\nsituation when M. le Comte de Stainville, specially recommended by His\r\nMajesty himself, asked for a private audience.\r\n\r\nAnd the next half-hour plunged M. le Duc into a perfect labyrinth of\r\nsurmises, conjectures, doubts and fears. That Gaston de Stainville was\r\npossessed not only of full knowledge with regard to the Stuart\r\nprince's hiding-place, but also of a letter in Lydie's handwriting,\r\naddressed to the prince and sealed with her private seal, was\r\nsufficiently astonishing in itself, but the young man's thinly veiled\r\ninnuendoes, his fatuous smiles, his obvious triumph, literally\r\nstaggered M. le Duc, even though his palm itched with longing for\r\ncontact with the insolent braggart's cheek. Every one of his beliefs\r\nwas being forcibly uprooted; his daughter whom he had thought so\r\nunapproachable, so pure and so loyal! who had this very morning shamed\r\nhim by her indignation at the very thought of this treachery, which\r\nshe now so completely condoned! that she should have renounced her\r\nopinions, her enthusiasm for the sake of a man who had already\r\nbetrayed her once, was more than M. le Duc could and would believe at\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nYet the proofs were before him at this very moment. They had been\r\nplaced in his hand by Gaston de Stainville: the map with the marginal\r\nnotes, which Lydie had so often refused to show even to her own\r\nfather, and the letter in her handwriting with the bold signature\r\nright across the contents, bidding the unfortunate young prince trust\r\nthe traitor who would deliver him into the hands of his foes.\r\n\r\nBut M. le Duc would have had to be more than human not to be satisfied\r\nin a measure at the result of Gaston de Stainville's diplomacy; he\r\nstood in for a goodly share of the millions promised by England. But\r\nit was the diplomacy itself which horrified him. He had vainly tried\r\nto dissuade Lydie from chivalrous and misguided efforts on behalf of\r\nthe young prince, or at any rate from active interference, if His\r\nMajesty had plans other than her own; but whilst she had rejected his\r\nmerest suggestions on that subject with unutterable contempt, she had\r\nnot only listened to Gaston de Stainville, but actually yielded her\r\nwill and her enthusiasms to his pleadings.\r\n\r\nM. le Duc sighed when he thought it all out. Though Lydie had done\r\nexactly what he himself wanted her to do, he hated the idea that she\r\nshould have done it because Gaston de Stainville had persuaded her.\r\n\r\nLater on in the afternoon when an excellently cooked dinner had\r\nsoftened his mood, he tried to put together the various pieces of the\r\nmental puzzle which confronted him.\r\n\r\nGaston de Stainville had obtained a certain ascendancy over Lydie, and\r\nLydie had irretrievably quarrelled with her husband. Milor was\r\ndetermined to quit Versailles immediately; Lydie was equally bent on\r\nnot relinquishing her position yet. Gaston de Stainville was obviously\r\ntriumphant and somewhat openly bragged of his success, whilst milor\r\nkept to his own private apartments, and steadily forbade his door to\r\nevery one.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a very difficult problem for an indulgent father to\r\nsolve. Fortunately for his own peace of mind, M. le Duc d'Aumont was\r\nnot only indulgent to his own daughter whom he adored, but also to\r\nevery one of her sex. He was above all a _preux chevalier_, who held\r\nthat women were beings of exceptional temperament, not to be judged by\r\nthe same standards as the coarser fibred male creatures; their beauty,\r\ntheir charm, the pleasure they afforded to the rest of mankind, placed\r\nthem above criticism or even comment.\r\n\r\nAnd of course Lydie was very beautiful . . . and milor a fool . . .\r\nand . . . Gaston. . . . Well! who could blame Gaston?\r\n\r\nAnd it was most amazingly lucky that Lydie had given up her absurd\r\nideas about that Stuart prince, and had thus helped those English\r\nmillions to find their way comfortably across the Channel, into the\r\npockets of His Majesty the King of France, and of one or two others,\r\nincluding her own doting father.\r\n\r\nAnd after that M. le Duc d'Aumont gave up worrying any more about the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE QUEEN'S SOIRÉE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat chronicler of true events will ever attempt to explain exactly\r\nhow rumour succeeds in breaking through every bond with which privacy\r\nwould desire to fetter her, and having obtained a perch on the\r\nswiftest of all currents of air, travels through infinite space, and\r\nanon, observing a glaringly public spot wherein to alight, she\r\ndescends with amazing rapidity and mingles with the crowd.\r\n\r\nThus with the news anent milor Eglinton's resignation of the General\r\nControl of Finance.\r\n\r\nBy the time the Court assembled that evening for the Queen's\r\nreception, every one had heard of it, and also that milor, having had\r\na violent quarrel with his wife, had quitted or was about to quit\r\nVersailles without further warning.\r\n\r\nThe news was indeed exceedingly welcome. Not from any ill-will toward\r\nLord Eglinton, of course, who was very popular with the ladies and\r\nmore than tolerated by the men, nor from any sense of triumph over\r\nMadame Lydie, although she had not quite so many friends as milor, but\r\nbecause it happened to be Thursday, and every Thursday Her Majesty the\r\nQueen held her Court from seven o'clock till nine o'clock: which\r\nfunction was so deadly dull, that there was quite an epidemic of\r\ndislocated jaws--caused by incessant yawning--among the favoured few\r\nwho were both privileged and obliged to attend. A piece of real\r\ngossip, well-authenticated, and referring to a couple so highly\r\nplaced as Lord and Lady Eglinton, was therefore a great boon. Even Her\r\nMajesty could not fail to be interested, as Lydie had always stood\r\nvery highly in the good graces of the prim and melancholy Queen,\r\nwhilst milor was one of that very small and very select circle which\r\nthe exalted lady honoured with her conversation on public occasions.\r\n\r\nNow on this same Thursday evening, Queen Marie Leszcynska entered her\r\nthrone-room precisely at seven o'clock. Madame Lydie was with her as\r\nshe entered, and it was at once supposed that Her Majesty was already\r\nacquainted with Lord Eglinton's decision, for she conversed with the\r\nneglected wife with obvious kindliness and sympathy.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty was expected in about a quarter of an hour. As Madame de\r\nPompadour and her immediate entourage were excluded from these solemn\r\nfunctions, the King showed his disapproval of the absence of his\r\nfriends by arriving as late as etiquette allowed, and by looking on at\r\nthe presentations, and other paraphernalia of his wife's receptions,\r\nin morose and silent _ennui_.\r\n\r\nThis evening, however, the proceedings were distinctly enlivened by\r\nthat subtle and cheerful breath of scandal, which hovered all over the\r\nroom. Whilst noble dowagers presented débutante daughters to Her\r\nMajesty, and grave gentlemen explained to fledgling sons how to make a\r\nfirst bow to the King, groups of younger people congregated in distant\r\ncorners, well away from the royal dais and discussed the great news of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nLydie did not mingle with these groups. In addition to her many other\r\ndignities and functions, she was Grande Maréchale de la Cour to Queen\r\nMarie Leszcynska and on these solemn Thursday evenings her place was\r\nbeside Her Majesty, and her duty to present such ladies of high rank\r\nwho had either just arrived at Court from the country or who, for some\r\nother reason, had not yet had the honour of a personal audience.\r\n\r\nChief among these reasons was the Queen's own exclusiveness. The proud\r\ndaughter of Stanislaus of Poland with her semi-religious education,\r\nher narrow outlook on life, her unfortunate experience of matrimony,\r\nhad a wholesome horror of the frisky matrons and flirtatious minxes\r\nwhom Louis XIV's taste had brought into vogue at the Court of France;\r\nand above all, she had an unconquerable aversion for the various\r\nscions of that mushroom nobility dragged from out the gutter by the\r\ncatholic fancies of le Roi Soleil.\r\n\r\nThough she could not help but receive some of these people at the\r\nmonster Court functions, which the elaborate and rigid etiquette of\r\nthe time imposed upon her, and whereat all the tatterdemalions that\r\nhad e'er filched a handle for their name had, by that same unwritten\r\ndictum, the right of entry, she always proudly refused subsequently to\r\nrecognize in private a presentation to herself, unless it was made by\r\nher special leave, at one of her own intimate audiences, and through\r\nthe mediation either of her own Grande Maréchale de la Cour, or of one\r\nof her privileged lady friends.\r\n\r\nThus Madame la Comtesse de Stainville, though formally presented at\r\nthe general Court by virtue of her husband's title and position, had\r\nnever had the honour of an invitation to Her Majesty's private\r\nthrone-room. Queen Marie had heard vague rumours anent the early\r\nreputation of \"la belle brune de Bordeaux\"; this very nick-name,\r\nfreely bandied about, grated on her puritanic ear. Irène de\r\nStainville, chafing under the restrictions which placed her on a level\r\nwith the Pompadours of the present and the Montespans or La Vallières\r\nof the past, had more than once striven to enlist Lydie's help and\r\nprotection in obtaining one of the coveted personal introductions to\r\nHer Majesty.\r\n\r\nLydie, however, had always put her off with polite but ambiguous\r\npromises, until to-day, when her heart, overfilled with gratitude for\r\nGaston de Stainville, prompted her to do something which she knew must\r\nplease him, and thus prove to him that she was thinking of him at the\r\nvery time when he was risking his entire future and probably his life\r\nin an attempt to serve her.\r\n\r\nHer own troubles and sorrows in no way interfered with the discharge\r\nof her social duties. Whilst she still occupied certain official\r\npositions at Court, she was determined to fill them adequately and\r\nwith perfect dignity. A brief note to Irène de Stainville acquainted\r\nthe latter lady with the pleasing fact, that Madame la Grande\r\nMaréchale would have much pleasure in introducing her personally to\r\nHer Majesty the Queen that very same evening, and \"la belle brune de\r\nBordeaux\" was therefore present at this most exclusive of all\r\nfunctions on Thursday, August 13, 1746, and duly awaited the happy\r\nmoment when she could make her curtsey before the proudest princess in\r\nall Europe, in the magnificent gown which had been prepared some time\r\nago in view of this possible and delightful eventuality.\r\n\r\nShe stood somewhat isolated from the rest of the throng, between two\r\nor three of her most faithful admirers, holding herself aloof from the\r\nfrivolity of the surrounding gossip and wearing a sphinx-like air of\r\ndetachment and of hidden and sorrowful knowledge.\r\n\r\nTo every comment as to the non-appearance of her lord at the soirée,\r\nshe had mutely replied by a slight shrug of the shoulders.\r\n\r\nUp in the gallery, behind a screen of exotic plants, the band of\r\nmusicians was playing one of M. Lulli's most famous compositions, the\r\nbeautiful motet in E flat which, alone amongst the works of that\r\nmaster of melody, was sufficiently serious and sedate for the Queen's\r\ntaste. Anon Her Majesty gave the signal that dancing might begin. She\r\nliked to watch it, if it was decorously performed, though she never\r\njoined in it herself. Therefore a measured and stately gavotte was\r\ndanced by the young people every Thursday, and perhaps a majestic\r\npavane afterward. But the minuet was thought unbecoming. Her Majesty\r\nsat in one of the heavy gilded chairs underneath the canopy, the other\r\nbeing reserved for King Louis.\r\n\r\nLydie watched the gavotte with dreamy, abstracted eyes; every now and\r\nthen the Queen spoke to her, and the force of habit caused her to\r\nreply coherently and with that formality of expression, which Her\r\nMajesty liked to hear. But her mind was very far from her\r\nsurroundings. It was accompanying Gaston de Stainville on his reckless\r\nride through the rich plains of Normandy; her wishes sped him on his\r\nway, her gratitude for his noble self-sacrifice would have guarded him\r\nfrom the perils of the road.\r\n\r\nThe monotonous tune of the gavotte with its distinct and sharply\r\ndefined beat, sounded to her like the measured clink of a horse's\r\nhoofs on rough hard ground. She was quite unconscious that, from every\r\ncorner of the room, inquisitive and sarcastic eyes were watching all\r\nher movements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nGOSSIP\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst the younger people danced, the older ones gossiped, and the\r\nabsence of any known facts rendered the gossip doubly interesting.\r\n\r\nThere was one group most especially so engaged; at the further corner\r\nof the room, and with sixteen dancing pairs intervening between it and\r\nthe royal daïs, there was little fear of Her Majesty overhearing any\r\nfrivolous comments on the all-absorbing topic of the day, or of Madame\r\nLydie herself being made aware of their existence.\r\n\r\nHere Madame de la Beaume, a young and pretty matron, possessed of a\r\ngood-looking husband who did not trouble her much with his company,\r\nwas the centre of a gaily cackling little crowd, not unlike an\r\nassemblage of geese beside a stream at eventide. Young M. de Louvois\r\nwas there and the old Duchesse de Pontchartrain, also M. Crébillon,\r\nthe most inveterate scandal-monger of his time, and several others.\r\n\r\nThey all talked in whispers, glad that the music drowned every echo of\r\nthis most enjoyable conversation.\r\n\r\n\"I have it from my coiffeur, whose son was on duty in an adjacent\r\nroom, that there was a violent quarrel between them,\" said Madame de\r\nla Beaume with becoming mystery. \"The man says that Madame Lydie\r\nscreamed and raged for half an hour, then flew out of the room and\r\nalong the passages like one possessed.\"\r\n\r\n\"These English are very peculiar people,\" said M. Crébillon\r\nsententiously. \"I have it on M. de Voltaire's own authority that\r\nEnglish husbands always beat their wives, and he spent some\r\nconsiderable time in England recently studying their manners and\r\ncustoms.\"\r\n\r\n\"We may take it for granted that milor Eglinton, though partly\r\ncivilized through his French parentage, hath retained some of his\r\nnative brutality,\" added another cavalier gravely.\r\n\r\n\"And it is quite natural that Madame Lydie would not tolerate his\r\ntreatment of her,\" concluded the old Duchess.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" sighed Madame de la Beaume pathetically, \"I believe that English\r\nhusbands beat their wives only out of jealousy. At least, so I have\r\nbeen told, whereas ours are too often unfaithful to feel any such\r\nviolent and uncomfortable pangs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely,\" quoth young M. de Louvois, casting an admiring glance at\r\nMadame's bold décolletage, \"you would not wish M. de la Beaume to lay\r\nhands on those beautiful shoulders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heu! heu!\" nodded Madame enigmatically.\r\n\r\nM. Crébillon cast an inquisitorial look at Madame de Stainville, who\r\nwas standing close by.\r\n\r\n\"Nay! from what I hear,\" he said mysteriously, \"milor Eglinton had\r\nquite sufficient provocation for his jealousy, and like an Englishman\r\nhe availed himself of the privileges which the customs of his own\r\ncountry grant him, and he frankly beat his wife.\"\r\n\r\nEvery one rallied round him, for he seemed to have fuller details than\r\nany one else, and Madame de la Beaume whispered eagerly:\r\n\r\n\"You mean M. de Stainville. . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush--sh--sh,\" interrupted the old Duchess quickly, \"here comes\r\nmiladi.\"\r\n\r\nThe Dowager Marchioness of Eglinton, \"miladi,\" as she was always\r\ncalled, was far too shrewd and too well versed in the manners and\r\ncustoms of her friends not to be fully aware of the gossip that was\r\ngoing on all round the room. Very irate at having been kept in\r\nignorance of the facts which had caused her son's sudden decision, and\r\nLydie's strange attitude, she was nevertheless determined that,\r\nwhatever scandal was being bruited abroad, it should prove primarily\r\nto the detriment of her daughter-in-law's reputation.\r\n\r\nTherefore, whenever, to-night, she noted groups congregated in\r\ncorners, and conversations being obviously carried on in whispers, she\r\nboldly approached and joined in the gossip, depositing a poisoned\r\nshaft here and there with great cleverness, all the more easily as it\r\nwas generally supposed that she knew a great deal more than she cared\r\nto say.\r\n\r\n\"Nay! I beg of you, Mesdames and Messieurs,\" she now said quite\r\ncheerfully, \"do not let me interrupt your conversation. Alas! do I not\r\nknow its subject? . . . My poor son cannot be to blame in the\r\nunfortunate affair. Lydie, though she may be wholly innocent in the\r\nmatter, is singularly obstinate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you really think that?----\" queried Madame de la Beaume eagerly,\r\nand then paused, half afraid that she had said too much.\r\n\r\n\"Alas! what can I say?\" rejoined miladi with a sigh. \"I was brought up\r\nin the days when we women were taught obedience to our husband's\r\nwishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame Lydie was not like to have learnt the first phrase of that\r\nwholesome lesson,\" quoth M. de Louvois with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly, cher Monsieur,\" assented miladi, as she sailed majestically\r\non to another group.\r\n\r\n\"What did miladi mean exactly?\" asked M. Crébillon.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! she is so kind-hearted, such an angel!\" sighed pretty Madame de\r\nla Beaume, \"she wanted to palliate Madame Lydie's conduct by\r\nsuggesting that milor merely desired to forbid her future intercourse\r\nwith M. de Stainville. . . . I have heard that version of the quarrel\r\nalready, but I must own that it bears but little resemblance to truth.\r\nWe all know that so simple a request would not have led to a really\r\nserious breach between milor and his wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was more than that, of course, or milor would not have beaten\r\nher,\" came in unanswerable logic from M. Crébillon.\r\n\r\n\"Hush--sh--sh!\" admonished the old Duchess, \"here comes His Majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"He looks wonderfully good-humoured,\" said Madame de la Beaume, \"and\r\ndoth not wear at all his usual Thursday's scowl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we may all be sure, Mesdames and Messieurs,\" said the\r\nirrepressible Crébillon, \"that rumour hath not lied again.\"\r\n\r\n\"What rumour?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have not heard?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" came from half a dozen eager and anxious lips.\r\n\r\n\"They say that His Majesty the King of France has agreed to deliver\r\nthe Chevalier de Saint George to the English in consideration of a\r\nlarge sum of money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\"\r\n\r\n\"That cannot be true!\"\r\n\r\n\"My valet had it from Monsieur de Stainville's man,\" protested M.\r\nCrébillon, \"and he declares the rumour true.\"\r\n\r\n\"A King of France would never do such a thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"A palpable and clumsy lie!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the same people, who, five minutes ago, had hurled the mud of\r\nscandal at the white robes of an exceptionally high-minded and\r\nvirtuous woman, recoiled with horror at the thought of any of it\r\nclinging to the person of that fat and pompous man, whom an evil fate\r\nhad placed on the throne of France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST DOUBT\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Majesty certainly looked far less bored than he usually did on his\r\nroyal consort's reception evenings. He entered the room with a\r\ngood-natured smile on his face, which did not leave him, even whilst\r\nhe kissed the frigid Queen's hand, and nodded to her entourage, every\r\none of whom he cordially detested.\r\n\r\nBut when he caught sight of Lydie, he positively beamed at her, and\r\nastonished all the scandal-mongers by the surfeit of attentions which\r\nhe bestowed on her. Directly after he had paid his respects to his\r\nwife and received the young scions of ancient aristocratic houses,\r\nthat were being presented to him, he turned with great alacrity to\r\nLydie and engaged her in close conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Will you honour us by stepping the pavane with us, Marquise?\" he\r\nasked in sugary tones. \"Alas! our dancing days should be over, yet par\r\nma foi! we could yet tread another measure beside the tiniest feet in\r\nFrance.\"\r\n\r\nLydie would perhaps have been taken aback at the King's superlative\r\namiability, but instinctively her mind reverted to the many occasions\r\nwhen he had thus tried to win her good graces, in the hope of\r\nobtaining concessions of money from the virtual chief of the\r\nDepartment of Finance. She saw that inquisitive eyes were watching her\r\nover-keenly as--unable to refuse the King's invitation--she placed a\r\nreluctant hand in his, and took her position beside him for the\r\nopening of the pavane.\r\n\r\nShe was essentially graceful even in the studied stiffness of her\r\nmovements; a stiffness which she had practised and then made entirely\r\nher own, and which was somehow expressive of the unbendable hauteur of\r\nher moral character.\r\n\r\nThe stately pavane suited the movements of her willowy figure, which\r\nappeared quite untrammelled, easy and full of spring, even within the\r\nnarrow confines of the fashionable corslet. She was dressed in white\r\nto-night and her young shoulders looked dazzling and creamy beside the\r\nmatt tone of her brocaded gown. She never allowed the ridiculous\r\ncoiffure, which had lately become the mode, to hide entirely the glory\r\nof her own chestnut hair, and its rich, warm colour gleamed through\r\nthe powder, scantily sprinkled over it by an artist's hand.\r\n\r\nShe had not forgotten even for a moment the serious events of this\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten day; but amongst the many memories which crowded\r\nin upon her, as, with slow step she trod the grave measure of the\r\ndance, none was more vivid than that of her husband's scorn, when he\r\nspoke of her own hand resting in that of the treacherous and\r\nperfidious monarch, who would have sold his friend for money. She\r\nwondered how he would act if he could see her now, her fingers, very\r\nfrequently meeting those of King Louis during the elaborate figures of\r\nthe dance.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, although everything milor had said to her at that\r\ninterview had merely jarred upon her mood and irritated her nerves,\r\nwithout seemingly carrying any conviction, yet now, when she was\r\nobliged to touch so often the moist, hot palm of King Louis, she felt\r\nsomething of that intolerable physical repugnance which her husband\r\nhad, as it were, brought to actuality by the vigour of his\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\nOtherwise she took little heed of her surroundings. During the\r\npreliminary movement of the dance, the march past, with its quaint,\r\nartificial gestures and steps and the slow majesty of its music, she\r\ncould not help seeing the looks of malevolent curiosity, of satisfied\r\nchildish envy, and of sarcastic triumph which were levelled at her\r\nfrom every corner of the room.\r\n\r\nThe special distinction bestowed on her by the King--who as a rule\r\nnever danced at his wife's soirées--seemed in the minds of all these\r\ngossip-lovers to have confirmed the worst rumours, anent the cause of\r\nLord Eglinton's unexpected resignation. His Majesty did not suffer\r\nlike his wife from an unconquerable horror of frisky matrons; on the\r\ncontrary, his abhorrence was chiefly directed against the starchy\r\ndowagers and the prudish _dévotes_ who formed the entourage of the\r\nQueen. The fact that he distinguished Lydie to-night so openly, showed\r\nthat he no longer classed her among the latter.\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty hath at last found a kindred spirit in the unapproachable\r\nMarchioness,\" was the universal comment, which thoroughly satisfied\r\nthe most virulent disseminator of ill-natured scandal.\r\n\r\nLydie knew enough of Court life to guess what would be said. Up to now\r\nshe had been happily free from Louis's compromising flatteries, save\r\nat such times when he required money, but his attentions went no\r\nfurther--and they invariably ceased the moment he had obtained all\r\nthat he wanted. But to-night he was unswerving in his adulation; and,\r\nin the brief pause between the second and third movement of the dance,\r\nhe contrived to whisper in her ear:\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Madame! how you shame your King! Shall we ever be able to\r\nadequately express the full measure of our gratitude?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gratitude, Sire?\" she murmured, somewhat bewildered and rather\r\ncoldly, \"I do not understand . . . why gratitude?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are modest, Madame, as well as brave and good,\" he rejoined,\r\ntaking one more opportunity of raising her hand to his lips. He had\r\nsucceeded in gradually leading her into a window embrasure, somewhat\r\naway from the rest of the dancers. He did not admire the statuesque\r\ngrace of Lydie in the least, and had always secretly sneered at her,\r\nfor her masculine strength of will and the rigidity of her principles,\r\nbut it had been impossible for any man, alive to a sense of what was\r\nbeautiful, not to delight in the exquisitely harmonious picture formed\r\nby that elegant woman, in her stiff, white brocaded gown and with her\r\nyoung head crowned by its wreath of ardent hair, standing out\r\nbrilliantly against the pale, buttercup colour of the damask curtain\r\nbehind her. There was nothing forced therefore in the look of\r\nadmiration with which the King now regarded Lydie; conscious of this,\r\nshe deeply resented the look, and perhaps because of it, she was not\r\nquite so fully alive to the hidden meaning of his words as she\r\notherwise might have been.\r\n\r\n\"And as beautiful as you are brave,\" added Louis unctuously. \"It is\r\nnot every woman who would thus have had the courage of her\r\nconvictions, and so openly borne witness to the trust and loyalty\r\nwhich she felt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, Sire,\" she said coldly and suddenly beginning to feel vaguely\r\npuzzled, \"I am afraid your Majesty is labouring under the\r\nmisapprehension, that I have recently done something to deserve\r\nspecial royal thanks, whereas----\"\r\n\r\n\"Whereas you have only followed the dictates of your heart,\" he\r\nrejoined gallantly, seeing that she had paused as if in search of a\r\nword, \"and shown to the sceptics in this ill-natured Court that,\r\nbeneath the rigid mask of iron determination, this exquisitely\r\nbeautiful personality hid the true instincts of adorable womanhood.\"\r\n\r\nThe musicians now struck the opening chords to the third and final\r\nmeasure of the pavane. There is something dreamy and almost sad in\r\nthis movement of the stately dance, and this melancholy is specially\r\naccentuated in the composition of Rameau, which the players were\r\nrendering with consummate art to-night. The King's unctuous words were\r\nstill ringing unpleasantly in Lydie's ears, when he put out his hand,\r\nclaiming hers for the dance.\r\n\r\nMechanically she followed him, her feet treading the measure quite\r\nindependently of her mind, which had gone wandering in the land of\r\ndreams. A vague sense of uneasiness crept slowly but surely into her\r\nheart, she pondered over Louis's words, not knowing what to make of\r\nthem, yet somehow beginning to fear them, or rather to fear that she\r\nmight after all succeed in understanding their full meaning. She could\r\nnot dismiss the certitude from her mind that he was, in some hidden\r\nsense, referring to the Stuart prince and his cause, when he spoke of\r\n\"convictions\" and of her \"courage\"; but at first she only thought that\r\nhe meant, in a vague way, to recall her interference of this morning,\r\nLord Eglinton's outburst of contempt, and her own promise to give the\r\nmatter serious consideration.\r\n\r\nThis in a measure re-assured her. The King's words had already become\r\nhazy in her memory, as she had not paid serious attention to them at\r\nthe time, and she gradually forced those vague fears within her to\r\nsubside, and even smiled at her own cowardice in scenting danger where\r\nnone existed.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly that was the true reason of the rapacious monarch's\r\nflatteries to-night; truth to tell, her mind had been so absorbed with\r\nactual events, her quarrel with her husband, the departure of Gaston,\r\nthe proposed expedition of _Le Monarque_, that she had almost\r\nforgotten the promise which she had made to the King earlier in the\r\nday, with a view to gaining time.\r\n\r\n\"How admirably you dance, Madame,\" said King Louis, \"the poetry of\r\nmotion by all the saints! Ah! believe me, I cannot conquer altogether\r\na feeling of unutterable envy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Envy, Sire, of whom?--or of what?\" she asked, forced to keep up a\r\nconversation which sickened her, since etiquette did not allow her to\r\nremain silent if the King desired to talk. \"Methinks fate leaves your\r\nMajesty but little to wish for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Envy of the lucky man who obtained a certitude, whilst we had to be\r\ncontent with vague if gracious promises,\" he rejoined blandly.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him keenly, inquiringly, a deep line of doubt, even of\r\nfear now settling between her brows.\r\n\r\n\"Certitude of what, Sire?\" she asked suddenly pausing in the dance and\r\nturning to look him straight in the eyes. \"I humbly crave your\r\nMajesty's pardon, but meseems that we are at cross-purposes, and that\r\nyour Majesty speaks of something which I, on the other hand, do not\r\nunderstand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay! nay! then we'll not refer to the subject again,\" rejoined Louis\r\nwith consummate gallantry, \"for of a truth we would not wish to lose\r\none precious moment of this heavenly dance. Enough that you\r\nunderstand, Madame, that your King is grateful, and will show his\r\ngratitude, even though his heart burn with jealousy at the good\r\nfortune of another man!\"\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking the sly leer which appeared in his eye as he\r\nspoke. Lydie felt her cheeks flaming up with sudden wrath; wrath,\r\nwhich as quickly gave way to an awful, an unconquerable horror.\r\n\r\nStill she did not suspect. Her feet once more trod the monotonous\r\nmeasure, but her heart beat wildly against the stiff corslet; the room\r\nbegan to whirl round before her eyes; a sickening sense of dizziness\r\nthreatened to master her. Every drop of blood had left her cheeks,\r\nleaving them ashen pale.\r\n\r\nShe was afraid; and the fear was all the more terrible as she could\r\nnot yet give it a name. But the sense of an awful catastrophe was upon\r\nher, impending, not yet materialized, but which would overwhelm her\r\ninevitably when it came.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE AWFUL CERTITUDE\r\n\r\n\r\nThen all at once she understood!\r\n\r\nThere at the further end of the room, against the rich gold of the\r\ncurtain, she saw Gaston de Stainville standing beside his wife and one\r\nor two other women, the centre of a gaily chattering crowd, he himself\r\nchattering with them, laughing and jesting, whilst from time to time\r\nhis white and slender hand raised a gold-rimmed glass to his eye, with\r\na gesture of fatuity and affectation.\r\n\r\nSomething in her look, though it had only lasted a few seconds, must\r\nthen and there have compelled his own, for he suddenly dropped his\r\nglass, and their eyes met across the room; Lydie's inquiring, only\r\njust beginning to doubt, and fearful, as if begging for reassurance!\r\nhis, mocking and malicious, triumphant too and self-flattering, whilst\r\nla belle Irène, intercepting this exchange of glances, laughed loudly\r\nand shrugged her bare shoulders.\r\n\r\nLydie was not that type of woman who faints, or screams at moments of\r\nacute mental agony. Even now, when the full horror of what she had so\r\nsuddenly realized, assailed her with a crushing blow that would have\r\nstunned a weaker nature, she contrived to pull herself together and to\r\ncontinue the dance to the end. The King--beginning to feel bored in\r\nthe company of this silent and obviously absent-minded woman--made no\r\nfurther effort at conversation. She had disappointed him; for\r\nMonsieur le Comte de Stainville's innuendoes had led him to hope that\r\nthe beautiful marble statue had at last come to life and would\r\nhenceforth become a valuable addition to the light-hearted circle of\r\nfriends that rallied round him, helping to make him forget the ennui\r\nof his matrimonial and official life.\r\n\r\nThus the dance was concluded between them in silence. Louis was too\r\ndull and vapid to notice the change in his partner's attitude, the icy\r\ntouch of her fingers, the deathly whiteness of her lips. But presently\r\nhe, too, caught sight of Gaston de Stainville and immediately there\r\ncrept into his face that malicious leer, which awhile ago had kindled\r\nLydie's wrath.\r\n\r\nWhether she noted it now or not, it were difficult to say. Only a\r\ngreat determination kept her from making a display before all these\r\nindifferent eyes, of the agonizing torture of her mind and heart.\r\n\r\nWith infinite relief, she made her final curtsey to her partner, and\r\nallowed him to lead her back to her official place beside the royal\r\ndaïs. She could not see clearly, for her eyes had suddenly filled with\r\nburning tears of shame and bitter self-accusation. She bit her lips\r\nlest a cry of pain escaped them.\r\n\r\n\"You are ill, my dear! Come away!\"\r\n\r\nThe voice--gentle and deeply concerned--was that of her father. She\r\ndid not dare look at him, lest she should break down, but she allowed\r\nhim to lead her away from the immediate noise and glare.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Lydie?\" queried M. le Duc again, more anxiously, as soon\r\nas they had reached a small and secluded alcove. \"Has anything\r\nfurther happened? Par Dieu, if that man has again dared . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"What man, father?\" she interrupted.\r\n\r\nHer voice had no tone in it, she wondered even if M. le Duc would\r\nhear, but he was talking ambiguously and she had had enough of\r\nmisunderstandings to-day.\r\n\r\n\"What man?\" rejoined Monsieur le Duc d'Aumont irritably. \"Your husband\r\nof course. I have heard rumours about his behaviour to you, and by all\r\nthe heathen gods . . .\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, astonished and almost awed, for Lydie had laughed suddenly,\r\nlaughed loudly and long, and there was such a strange ring in that\r\nunnatural mirth, that Monsieur le Duc feared lest excitement had been\r\ntoo much for his daughter's brain.\r\n\r\n\"Lydie! what is it? You must tell me . . . Lydie . . .\" he urged,\r\n\"listen to me . . . do you hear me, Lydie?\"\r\n\r\nShe seemed to be collecting her scattered senses now, but great sobs\r\nof hysterical laughter still shook her from head to foot, and she\r\nleaned against her father's arm almost as if she feared to fall.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, father dear,\" she said fairly coherently, \"I do hear you, and I\r\npray you take no heed of me. Much hath occurred to-day to disturb me\r\nand my nerves seem to be on the jar. Perhaps I do not see quite\r\nclearly either. Father, tell me,\" she added with a voice almost\r\nsteady, but harsh and trenchant, and with glowing eyes fixed on the\r\nDuke's face, \"did I perceive Gaston de Stainville in the crowd just\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\n\"You may have done, my dear,\" he replied with some hesitation. \"I do\r\nnot know.\"\r\n\r\nShe had been quick enough to note that, at mention of Gaston's name,\r\nhis eyes suddenly wore a curious shamefaced expression and avoided\r\nmeeting her own. She pressed her point more carelessly, feeling that\r\nthere was something that he would only tell her, if she was perfectly\r\ncalm and natural in her questionings.\r\n\r\n\"Then he is here?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes . . . I believe so . . . why do you ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought him gone,\" she said lightly, \"that was all. Methought there\r\nwas an errand he had meant to perform.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! there is no immediate hurry for that!\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur le Duc d'Amont, never a very keen observer, was feeling quite\r\nreassured by her calmer mood. His daughter had been overwrought.\r\nEvents had crowded in upon her, thick and fast, some of them of an\r\nunpleasant nature: her final surrender to Gaston de Stainville could\r\nnot have occurred without a wrench; sentiment--he supposed--having\r\nconquered friendship and loyalty, no doubt remorse had held sway for\r\nawhile. He certainly thought his daughter quite at one with him and\r\nhis confederates in the treacherous plan; it never entered his head\r\nfor a moment to blame her for this _volte-face_, nor did he realize\r\nthat Gaston's attitude had been one of lying infamy. He knew her for a\r\npure-minded and exceptionally proud woman and his paternal heart had\r\nno fear that she would stoop to a vulgar intrigue, at the same time he\r\nhad no reason to doubt that she had yielded to the persuasive powers\r\nof a man whom she had certainly loved at one time, who and of\r\nnecessity would still exercise a certain influence over her.\r\n\r\nAnd now she was no doubt anxious to know something of future plans\r\nshe had probably not heard what had been decided with regard to the\r\nexpedition, and perhaps fretted as to how her own actions had been\r\ninterpreted by her father and the King. It was with a view to\r\nreassuring her on all these points that he now added:\r\n\r\n\"We are not thinking of sending _Le Monarque_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah? I thought that she would have been the most likely vessel. . .\"\r\n\r\n\"_Le Levantin_ will be safer,\" he explained, \"but she will not be\r\nready to put to sea for five or six days, so Gaston will not start\r\nuntil then; but you need have no fear, dear; the orders together with\r\nthe map and the precious letter, which you have given him, are quite\r\nsafe in his hands. He is too deeply concerned in the success of the\r\nexpedition to think of betraying you, even if his regard were less\r\ngenuine. . . . And we are all deeply grateful to you, my dear . . . It\r\nwas all for the best. . .\"\r\n\r\nHe patted her hand with kindly affection, much relieved now, for she\r\nseemed quite calm and the colour even was coming back to her cheeks:\r\nall the afternoon he had been dreading this meeting with his daughter,\r\nfor he had not seen her since he learned from Gaston that she had\r\nyielded to his entreaties, and given him the map and letter which\r\nwould help the King of France to betray his friend: now he was glad to\r\nfind that--save for an unusual hysterical outburst--she took the whole\r\nmatter as coolly as he did himself.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that there are moments in life when a crisis is so\r\nacute, a catastrophe so overwhelming, that all our faculties become\r\ncompletely deadened: our individuality goes out of us, and we become\r\nmere dolls moving automatically by muscular action and quite\r\nindependently of our brain.\r\n\r\nThus it was with Lydie.\r\n\r\nHer father's words could not be misunderstood. They left her without\r\nthat last faint shadow of doubt which, almost unbeknown to herself,\r\nhad been her main support during the past few minutes of this intense\r\nagony. Now the tiny vestige of hope had vanished. Blank despair\r\ninvaded her brain and she had the sensation as if sorrow had turned it\r\ninto a pulpy mass, a great deal too bulky for her head, causing it to\r\nthrob and to ache intolerably. Beyond that, the rest of herself as it\r\nwere, became quite mechanical. She was glad that her father said\r\nnothing more about the scheme. She knew all that she wanted to know:\r\nGaston's hideous, horrible treachery, the clumsy trap into which she\r\nhad fallen, and above all the hopeless peril into which she had\r\nplunged the very man whom she had wished to save.\r\n\r\nShe had been the most perfidious traitor amongst them all, for the\r\nunfortunate prince had given her his friendship, and had trusted her\r\nmore fully than he had others.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was her husband!\r\n\r\nOf him she would not think, for that way lay madness surely!\r\n\r\nShe managed to smile to her father, and to reassure him. Presently she\r\nwould tell him all . . . to-morrow perhaps, but not just yet . . . She\r\ndid not hate him somehow. She could not have hated him, for she knew\r\nhim and had always loved him. But he was weak and easily misguided.\r\n\r\nHeavens above! had anyone been more culpably weak, more misguided than\r\nshe herself?\r\n\r\nMonsieur le Duc, fully satisfied in his mind now by her outward calm,\r\nand the steady brilliance of her eyes, recalled her to her official\r\nduties.\r\n\r\n\"Dancing is over, Lydie,\" he said, \"have you not a few presentations\r\nto Her Majesty to effect?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes!\" she said perfectly naturally, \"of a truth I had almost\r\nforgotten . . . the first time for many years, eh? my dear father. . .\r\nHow some people will gossip at this remissness of Madame la Grande\r\nMaréchale de la Cour . . . will you conduct me straight away to Her\r\nMajesty? . . . I hope she has not yet noticed my absence.\"\r\n\r\nShe leaned somewhat heavily on her father's arm, for she was afraid\r\nthat she could not otherwise have walked quite straight. She fully\r\nrealized what it meant when men talked of drunkenness amongst\r\nthemselves. Copious libations must produce--she thought--just this\r\nsame sensation of swaying and tottering, and hideous, painful\r\ngiddiness.\r\n\r\nAlready Monsieur de Louvois, Her Majesty's Chamberlain, was waiting,\r\nwhilst the ladies, who were to receive the honour of special\r\npresentation, were arraigned in a semi-circle to the left of the dais.\r\nBeneath the canopy the King and Queen were standing: Louis looking as\r\nusual insufferably bored, and the Queen calmly dignified, not a little\r\ndisdainful, and closely scrutinizing the bevy of women--more or less\r\ngorgeously apparelled, some old, some young, mostly rather dowdy and\r\nstiff in their appearance--who were waiting to be introduced.\r\n\r\nQuickly, and with a respectful curtsey indicative of apology, Lydie\r\nnow took her stand beside her Royal mistress and the ceremony of\r\npresentations began. The chamberlain read out a name; one unit\r\nthereupon detached itself from the feminine group, approached with\r\nsedate steps to the foot of the throne, and made a deep obeisance,\r\nwhilst Madame la Grande Maréchale said a few appropriate words, that\r\nwere meant to individualize that unit in the mind of the Queen.\r\n\r\n\"Madame de Balincourt. Your Majesty will deign to remember the brave\r\nGeneral who fought at Fontenoy. Madame has eschewed country life\r\nmomentarily for the honour of being presented to your Majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enchantée, Madame,\" the Queen would reply graciously, offering her\r\nhand for a respectful kiss.\r\n\r\n\"Madame Helvetius, the wife of our renowned scientist and philosopher.\r\nYour Majesty is acquainted with his works.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enchantée, Madame!\"\r\n\r\n\"And Mademoiselle Helvetius, striving to become as learned as her\r\ndistinguished father, and almost succeeding so 'tis said.\"\r\n\r\nThe Queen deigned to say a few special words to this shy _débutante_\r\nand to her mother, both primly clad in badly-fitting gowns which\r\nproclaimed the country dressmaker, but in their simplicity and\r\ngaucherie peculiarly pleasing to Her Majesty.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the procession filed past. Elderly women and young girls,\r\nsome twenty in all, mostly hailing from distant parts of France, where\r\nthe noise and frivolity of the Court of Versailles had not even roused\r\nan echo. The Queen was very gracious. She liked this select little\r\ncircle of somewhat dowdy provincials, who she felt would be quite at\r\none with her in her desire for the regeneration of social France. The\r\nuglier and less fashionable were the women, the more drabby and\r\nill-fitting their clothes, the sweeter and more encouraging became Her\r\nMajesty's smile. She asked lengthy questions from her Grande\r\nMaréchale, and seemed to take a malicious delight in irritating the\r\nKing, by protracting this ceremony, which she knew bored him to\r\ndistraction, until he could scarcely manage to smother the yawns which\r\ncontinually assailed his jaws.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Lydie felt her limbs stiffen and her throat close as if iron\r\nfingers had gripped it. She had been saying the usual platitudes anent\r\nthe wife, sister or aunt of some worthy general or country squire,\r\nwhen Monsieur de Louvois called out a name:\r\n\r\n\"Madame la Comtesse de Stainville.\"\r\n\r\nAnd from out the group of dowdy country matrons and starchy-looking\r\n_dévotes_ a brilliant figure now detached itself and glided forward\r\nwith consummate grace. Irène de Stainville was approaching for\r\npresentation to the Queen, her eyes becomingly cast down, a rosy flush\r\non her cheeks, for she was conscious that she was beautiful and that\r\nthe King's wearied eyes had lighted up at sight of her.\r\n\r\nThere was something almost insolent in the gorgeousness of her gown:\r\nit was of a rich turquoise blue, that stood out, glaring and vivid\r\nagainst the buttercup-coloured hangings of the room. Her stiff corslet\r\nwas frankly _décolleté_, displaying her fine shoulders and creamy\r\nbosom, on which reposed a delicately wrought turquoise necklet of\r\nexquisite design. Her hair was piled up over her head, in the\r\nmonumental and _outré_ style lately decreed by Dame Fashion, and the\r\nbrocade of her panniers stood out in stiff folds each side of her,\r\nlike balloon-shaped supports, on which her white arms rested with\r\ngraceful ease. It seemed as if a gaudy, exotic butterfly had lost its\r\nway, and accidentally fluttered into an assembly of moths.\r\n\r\nGaston de Stainville stood a little behind his wife. Etiquette\r\ndemanded that he should be near her, when she made her obesiance to\r\nthe Queen. He, too, somehow, looked out of place among these more\r\nsedate cavaliers: there had always been a very distinct difference\r\nbetween the dress worn by the ladies and gentlemen of the Queen's\r\nentourage, and the more ornate style adopted by the gayer frequenters\r\nof the Court of Versailles. This difference was specially noticeable\r\nnow, when this handsome young couple stood before Her Majesty, she not\r\nunlike a glittering jewel herself, he in a satin coat of pale mauve,\r\nthat recalled the delicate shades of a bank of candytuft in mid-June.\r\n\r\nThe Queen no longer looked down from her daïs with an indulgent,\r\nsomewhat melancholy smile. Her eyes--cold and gray as those of King\r\nStanislaus had been--regarded with distinct disapproval these two\r\npeople, who, in her rigid judgment, were naught but gaudily decked-out\r\ndolls, and who walked on high-heeled shoes that made an unpleasant\r\nnoise on the polished floor.\r\n\r\nLydie had during the last agonizing half-hour wholly forgotten Irène\r\nde Stainville and the presentation which, on an impulse of gratitude\r\ntoward Gaston, she had promised to bring about, and she certainly had\r\nnot been prepared for this meeting, face to face, with the man who,\r\nfor the second time in her life, had so bitterly and cruelly wronged\r\nher.\r\n\r\nGaston did not seem anxious to avoid her gaze. There was insolent\r\ntriumph and mockery in every line of his attitude: in the head thrown\r\na little to one side; in the eyes narrowed until they were slits,\r\ngazing at her over the barrier of his wife's elaborate coiffure: in\r\nthe slender, well-kept hand toying with the gold-rimmed eyeglass, and\r\nabove all in the sensual, sneering mouth, and the full lips parted in\r\na smile.\r\n\r\nLydie was hardly conscious of Irène's presence, of any one in fact,\r\nsave of Gaston de Stainville, of whom she had dreamed so romantically\r\na few hours ago, speeding him on his way, praying--God help her!--that\r\nhe might be well and safe. An intense bitterness surged up in her\r\nheart, a deadly contempt for him. Awhile ago she would not have\r\nbelieved that she could hate anyone so. She would at this moment have\r\ngladly bartered her life for the joy of doing him some awful injury.\r\nAll softness, gentleness, went out of her nature, just while she\r\nlooked at Gaston and caught his mocking smile.\r\n\r\nIt was the mockery that hurt her so! The awful humiliation of it all!\r\n\r\nAnd there was also in Lydie that highly sensitive sense of loyalty,\r\nwhich revolted at the sight of these traitors approaching, with a\r\nsmile of complacency on their lips, this proud Queen who was ignorant\r\nof their infamy.\r\n\r\nWomen have often been called petty in their hates: rightly perhaps!\r\nbut let us remember that their power to punish is limited, and\r\ntherefore they strike as best they can. Lydie, in spite of her\r\ninfluence and her high position, could do so little to punish Gaston,\r\nnow that by his abominable treachery he had filched every trump card\r\nfrom her.\r\n\r\nShe had been such an unpardonable fool--and she knew it--that her very\r\nself-abasement whipped up her sense of retaliation, her desire for\r\nsome sort of revenge, into veritable fury; and thus, when la belle\r\nIrène, triumphant in the pride of her universally acknowledged\r\nbeauty, came to the foot of the Royal daïs, when--through some\r\nunexplainable and occult reason--a hush of expectancy descended on all\r\nspectators, Lydie's voice was suddenly raised, trenchant and decisive:\r\n\r\n\"This is an error on Monsieur le Chambellan's part,\" she said loudly,\r\nso that everyone in the vast audience-chamber might hear. \"There is no\r\none here to present this lady to Her Majesty!\"\r\n\r\nA gasp went round the room, a sigh of astonishment, of horror, of\r\nanticipation, and in the silence that immediately followed, the\r\nproverbial pin would have been heard to drop: every rustle of a silken\r\ngown, every creak of a shoe sounded clear and distinct, as did the\r\nquickly-suppressed sneer that escaped Gaston de Stainville's lips and\r\nthe frou-frou of his satin coat sleeve as he raised the gold-rimmed\r\nglass to his eye.\r\n\r\nWhat were the joys of gossip in comparison with this unexpected\r\nsensation, which moreover would certainly be the prelude to an amazing\r\nscandal? Anon everyone drew instinctively nearer. All eyes were fixed\r\non the several actors of this palpitating little scene.\r\n\r\nAlready Irène had straightened her graceful figure, with a quick jerk\r\nas if she had been struck. The terrible affront must have taken her\r\ncompletely unawares, but now that it had come, she instantly guessed\r\nits cause. Nevertheless there was nothing daunted or bashful about her\r\nattitude. The colour blazed into her cheeks, and her fine dark eyes\r\nresponded to Lydie's scornful glance with one of defiance and of hate.\r\n\r\nThe Queen looked visibly annoyed. She disliked scenes and\r\nunpleasantness, and all incidents which disturbed the even placidity\r\nof her official life: the King, on the other hand, swore an\r\nunmistakable oath. Obviously he had already taken sides in favour of\r\nthe gaily-plumaged butterfly against the duller moths, whilst Monsieur\r\nde Louvois looked hopelessly perturbed. He was very young and had only\r\nlately been appointed to the onerous position of Queen's Chamberlain.\r\nThough the post was no sinecure, a scandal such as threatened now, was\r\nquite unprecedented. He scented a violent passage of arms between two\r\nyoung and beautiful women, both of high social position, and manlike\r\nhe would sooner have faced a charge of artillery than this duel\r\nbetween two pairs of rosy lips, wherein he feared that he might be\r\ncalled upon to arbitrate.\r\n\r\nLydie, alone among all those present, had retained her outward\r\nserenity. This was her hour, and she meant to press her triumph home\r\nto the full. All the pent-up horror and loathing which had well-nigh\r\nchoked her during the whole of this terrible day, now rose clamouring\r\nand persistent in this opportunity for revenge. Though Gaston stood\r\ncalm and mocking by, though Irène looked defiant and her cheeks flamed\r\nwith wrath, they would glow with shame anon, for Lydie had\r\ndeliberately aimed a blow at her vanity, the great and vulnerable spot\r\nin the armour of _la belle brune de Bordeaux_.\r\n\r\nLydie knew Marie Leszcynska well enough to be sure that the very\r\nbreath of scandal, which she had deliberately blown on Gaston's wife,\r\nwas enough to cause the rigid, puritanically-minded Queen to refuse\r\nall future intercourse with her. Rightly or wrongly, without further\r\njudgment or appeal, the Queen would condemn Irène unheard, and ban\r\nher and her husband for ever from her intimacy, thus setting the mark\r\nof a certain social ostracism upon them, which they could never live\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nLess than three seconds had elapsed whilst these conflicting emotions\r\nassailed the various actors of this drawing-room drama. The Queen now\r\nturned with a frown half-inquiring, wholly disapproving toward the\r\nunfortunate Louvois.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur le Chambellan,\" she said sternly, \"how did this occur? We do\r\nnot allow any error to creep in the list of presentations made to our\r\nRoyal person.\"\r\n\r\nThese few words recalled Irène to the imminence of her peril. She\r\nwould not allow herself to be humiliated without a protest, nor would\r\nshe so readily fall a victim to Lydie's obvious desire for revenge.\r\nShe too was shrewd enough to know that the Queen would never forgive,\r\nand certainly never forget, the _esclandre_ of this presentation; but\r\nif she herself was destined to fall socially, at least she would drag\r\nher enemy down with her, and bury Lydie's influence, power and\r\npopularity beneath the ruins of her own ambitions.\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty will deign I hope to pause a moment ere you sweep me\r\nfrom before your Royal eyes unheard,\" she said boldly; \"the error is\r\non the part of Madame la Grande Maréchale. My name was put on Monsieur\r\nle Chambellan's list by her orders.\"\r\n\r\nBut Marie Leszcynska would not at this juncture take any direct notice\r\nof Irène; until it was made quite clear that Madame la Comtesse de\r\nStainville was a fit and proper person to be presented to the Queen of\r\nFrance, she absolutely ignored her very existence, lest a word from\r\nher be interpreted as implying encouragement, or at least\r\nrecognition. Therefore she looked beyond Irène, straight at Monsieur\r\nde Louvois, and addressed herself directly to him.\r\n\r\n\"What are the true facts, Monsieur le Chambellan?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I certainly . . . er . . . had the list as usual . . . er . . . from\r\nMadame la Grande Maréchale . . . and . . .\" poor Monsieur de Louvois\r\nstammered in a fit of acute nervousness.\r\n\r\n\"Then 'tis from you, Madame la Marquise, that we require an\r\nexplanation for this unseemly disturbance,\" rejoined Her Majesty\r\nturning her cold, gray eyes on Lydie.\r\n\r\n\"The explanation is quite simple, your Majesty,\" replied Lydie calmly.\r\n\"It had been my intention to present Madame la Comtesse de Stainville\r\nto your Majesty, but since then events have occurred, which will\r\ncompel me to ask Madame la Comtesse to find some other lady to perform\r\nthe office for her.\"\r\n\r\n\"The explanation is not quite satisfactory to us,\" rejoined Her\r\nMajesty with all the rigid hauteur of which she possessed the stinging\r\nsecret, \"and it will have to be properly and officially amplified\r\nto-morrow. But this is neither the place nor the moment for discussing\r\nsuch matters. Monsieur de Louvois, I pray you to proceed with the\r\nother names on your list. The Queen has spoken!\"\r\n\r\nWith these arrogant words culled from the book of etiquette peculiar\r\nto her own autocratic house, the daughter of the deposed King of\r\nPoland waved the incident aside as if it had never been. A quickly\r\nrepressed murmur went all round the room. Lydie swept a deep and\r\nrespectful curtsey before Her Majesty, and indicated by her own\r\nmanner that, as far as she was concerned, the incident was now closed\r\nby royal command.\r\n\r\nBut Irène de Stainville's nature was not one that would allow the\r\nmatter to be passed over so lightly. Whichever way the Queen might\r\nchoose to act, she felt that at any rate the men must be on her side:\r\nand though King Louis himself was too indolent and egotistical to\r\ninterfere actively on her behalf, and her own husband could not do\r\nmore than pick a quarrel with some wholly innocent person, yet she was\r\nquite sure that she detected approval and encouragement to fight her\r\nown battles in the looks of undisguised admiration which the masculine\r\nelement there present freely bestowed upon her. Monsieur le Duc\r\nd'Aumont, for one, looked stern disapproval at his daughter, whilst\r\nMonsieur de Louvois was visibly embarrassed.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, only a case of two female enemies, one of whom\r\ncertainly was the Queen of France--a prejudiced and obstinate autocrat\r\nif ever there was one, within the narrow confines of her own intimate\r\ncircle--and the other exceptionally highly placed, both in Court\r\nfavour and in official status.\r\n\r\nStill Irène de Stainville felt that her own beauty was at least as\r\npowerful an asset, when fighting for social prestige, as the political\r\ninfluence of her chief adversary.\r\n\r\nTherefore when the Queen of France chose to speak as if Madame la\r\nComtesse de Stainville did not even exist, and Monsieur de Louvois\r\ndiffidently but firmly begged her to stand aside, she boldly refused.\r\n\r\n\"Nay! the Queen shall hear me,\" she said in a voice which trembled a\r\nlittle now with suppressed passion; \"surely Her Majesty will not allow\r\na jealous woman's caprice . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence, wench,\" interrupted Marie Leszcynska with all the authority,\r\nthe pride, the dictatorial will, which she had inherited from her\r\nPolish ancestors; \"you forget that you are in the presence of your\r\nQueen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, Madame, I do not forget it,\" said Irène, nothing daunted, and\r\nfirmly holding her ground. \"I remember it with every word I utter, and\r\nremember that the name of our Queen stands for purity and for justice.\r\nYour Majesty,\" she added, being quick to note the slightly yielding\r\nlook which, at her cleverly chosen words, crept in Marie Leszcynska's\r\neyes, and gracefully dropping on her knees on the steps of the throne,\r\n\"will you at least deign to hear me? I may not be worthy to kiss your\r\nMajesty's hand; we none of us are that, I presume, for you stand\r\ninfinitely above us by right of your virtues and your dignity, but I\r\nswear to the Queen of France that I have done nothing to deserve this\r\npublic affront.\"\r\n\r\nShe paused a moment, to assure herself that she held the attention of\r\nthe Queen and of every one there present, then she fixed her dark eyes\r\nstraight on Lydie and said loudly, so that her clear, somewhat shrill\r\nyoung voice rang out triumphantly through the room:\r\n\r\n\"My husband was made a tool of by Madame la Marquise d'Eglinton, for\r\nthe purpose of selling the Stuart prince to England.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more there was dead silence in the vast reception hall, a few\r\nseconds during which the loudly accusing voice died away in an almost\r\nimperceptible echo, but in one heart at least those seconds might have\r\nbeen a hundred hours, for the wealth of misery they contained.\r\n\r\nLydie stood as if turned to stone. Though she had realized Gaston's\r\ntreachery she had not thought that it would mean all this. The utter\r\ninfamy of it left her paralyzed and helpless. She had delivered her\r\nsoul, her mind, her honour, her integrity to the vilest traitor that\r\never darkened the face of the earth. If a year ago she had humiliated\r\nhim, if to-day she had tried to thwart all his future ambitions, he\r\nwas fully revenged now.\r\n\r\nShe did not hear even the loyal Queen's protest:\r\n\r\n\"It is false!\" for Marie Leszcynska, sickened and horrified, was loth\r\nto believe the truth of this terrible indictment against the one woman\r\nshe had always singled out for royal trust and royal friendship.\r\n\r\n\"It is true, your Majesty,\" said Irène firmly, as she once more rose\r\nto her feet. \"Deign to ask Madame la Marquise d'Eglinton if to-day in\r\nthe loneliness of the Park of Versailles, she did not place in the\r\nhands of Monsieur le Comte de Stainville the secret of the Stuart\r\nprince's hiding place so that he might be delivered over to the\r\nEnglish for a large sum of money. Madame is beautiful and rich and\r\ninfluential, Monsieur de Stainville being a man, dared not refuse to\r\nobey her orders, but Monsieur de Stainville is also handsome and\r\nyoung, Madame honoured him with her regard, and I the wife was to be\r\npublicly ostracised and swept aside, for I was in the way, and might\r\nhave an indiscreet tongue in my mouth. That, your Majesty, is the\r\ntruth,\" concluded Irène now with triumphant calm; \"deign to look into\r\nher face and mine and see which is the paler, she or I.\"\r\n\r\nMarie Leszcynska had listened in silence at the awful accusation thus\r\nhurled by one woman against the other. At Irène's final words she\r\nturned and looked at Lydie, saw the marble-like hue of the face, the\r\nrigidity of the young form, the hopeless despair expressed in the\r\nhalf-closed eyes. It is but fair to say that the Queen even now did\r\nnot altogether believe Madame de Stainville's story: she instinctively\r\nwas still drawing a comparison between the gaudily apparelled doll\r\nwith the shrill voice, and the impudently bared shoulders, and the\r\nproud, graceful woman in robes of virginal white, of whom, during all\r\nthese years of public life, unkind tongues were only able to say that\r\nshe was cold, rigid, dull, uninteresting perhaps, but whose vestal\r\nrobes the breath of evil scandal had never dared to pollute.\r\n\r\nThe Queen did not feel that guilt was written now on that straight,\r\npure brow, but she had a perfectly morbid horror of any _esclandre_\r\noccurring in her presence or at one of her Courts. Moreover, Irène had\r\ncertainly struck one chord, which jarred horribly on the puritanical\r\nQueen's nerves, and unfortunately at the very moment when Madame de\r\nStainville made this final poisoned suggestion, Marie Lesczynska's\r\neyes happened to be resting on the King's face. In Louis' expression\r\nshe caught the leer, the smile, half-mocking, half indulgent which was\r\nhabitual to him when woman's frailty was discussed, and her whole\r\npride rose in revolt at contact with these perpetual scandals, which\r\ndisgraced the Court of Versailles, and which she was striving so hard\r\nto banish from her own entourage.\r\n\r\nBecause of this she felt angered now with every one quite\r\nindiscriminately. A few years ago her sense of justice would have\r\ncaused her to sift this matter through, to test for herself the rights\r\nor wrongs of an obviously bitter quarrel; but lately this sense of\r\njustice had become blunted, through many affronts to her personal\r\ndignity as a Queen and as a wife. It had left her with a morbid\r\negotistical regard for the majesty of her Court: this she felt had\r\nbeen attainted; and now she only longed to get away, and leave behind\r\nher all this vulgarity, these passions, these petty quarrels, which\r\nshe so cordially abhorred.\r\n\r\n\"Enough,\" she said sternly; \"our royal cheeks glow with shame at\r\nthought that this indecent brawl should have occurred in our presence.\r\nYour Majesty,\" she added turning haughtily to the King, \"your arm, I\r\npray; we cannot endure this noisy bickering, which is more fitting for\r\nthe slums of Paris than for the throne-room of the Queen of France.\"\r\n\r\nLouis' bewilderment was almost comical. It would have been utterly\r\nimpossible for him, and quite unseemly in his wife's presence, to\r\ninterfere in what was obviously a feminine quarrel, even if he had\r\ndesired to do so; and he had not altogether made up his mind how\r\nMadame la Comtesse de Stainville's indiscreet outburst would affect\r\nhim personally, which was all that really interested him in the\r\nmatter. On the whole he was inclined to think favourably of the new\r\naspect of affairs. When the fact of the Stuart prince's betrayal into\r\nhis enemies' hands became known--which it was bound to do sooner or\r\nlater--it was not unpleasant that the first hint of the treachery\r\nshould have come in such a form as to implicate Lydie, and that so\r\ndeeply, that ever afterward the public, clinging to the old proverb\r\nthat there is no smoke without fire, would look upon her as the prime\r\nmover in the nefarious scheme.\r\n\r\nLouis the Well-beloved possessed, par excellence, the subtle knack of\r\ntaking care of his august person, and above all of his august\r\nreputation. It would certainly be as well, for the sake of the\r\nfuture, that his over-indulgent subjects should foster the belief\r\nthat, in this vile treachery, their King had been misled; more sinned\r\nagainst than sinning.\r\n\r\nBut of course he too was anxious to get away. That the present\r\nfeminine altercation would lead to a more serious quarrel, he already\r\nguessed from the fact that his shrewd eyes had perceived Lord Eglinton\r\nstanding close to one of the great doors at the further end of the\r\nroom. Vaguely Louis wondered how much the husband had heard, and what\r\nhe would do if he had heard everything. Then he mentally shrugged his\r\nshoulders, thinking that after all it did not matter what milor's\r\nfuture actions might be. Louis was quite convinced that Madame Lydie\r\nhad thrown her bonnet over the mills, and that, as a gallant\r\ngentleman, milor would above all things have to hold his peace.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty therefore was not angered against any one. He smiled quite\r\naffably at the Comte and Comtesse de Stainville and bestowed a knowing\r\nwink on Lydie, who fortunately was too dazed to notice this final\r\ninsult.\r\n\r\nEvery one else was silent and awed. The Queen now descended the steps\r\nof the daïs on the arm of the King. Irène was a little disappointed\r\nthat nothing more was going to happen. She opened her lips, ready to\r\nspeak again but Marie Leszcynska threw her such a haughty, scornful\r\nglance that Gaston de Stainville, realizing the futility--nay! the\r\ndanger---of prolonging this scene, placed a peremptory hand on his\r\nwife's arm, forcibly drawing her away.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the steps Her Majesty once more turned to Lydie.\r\n\r\n\"We shall expect an explanation from you, Marquise,\" she said\r\nhaughtily, \"but not to-night. See that our audience chamber is cleared\r\nfrom all this rabble.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with this parting shot, hurled recklessly at her faithful\r\nadherents, just as much as at those who had offended her, the\r\ndescendant of a proud line of Kings sailed majestically out of the\r\nroom, whilst a loud \"hush-sh-sh-sh . . .\" caused by the swish of\r\nbrocaded skirts on the parquet floor as every one made a deep\r\nobeisance, accompanied the Royal lady in her short progress toward the\r\ndoor and then softly died away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nA FALL\r\n\r\n\r\nIrène de Stainville was quite right when she thought that sympathy\r\nwould be on her side, in the grave affront which had been put upon\r\nher, and for which she had revenged herself somewhat drastically, but\r\nunder the circumstances quite naturally.\r\n\r\nAlthough in this circle--known as the Queen's set--the young\r\nMarchioness of Eglinton had always been looked up to as a leader and\r\nan especial favourite, the accusation which Irène had brought against\r\nher was so awful, her own attitude of passive acquiescence so\r\nincomprehensible, that it was small wonder that after the departure of\r\nTheir Majesties, when the crowd broke up into isolated groups, most\r\npeople there present held themselves aloof from her.\r\n\r\nThe words \"a jealous woman's caprice,\" which at the outset had so\r\nangered the Queen, expressed fully the interpretation put upon Lydie's\r\nconduct by those who witnessed the scene from beginning to end. That\r\nIrène de Stainville had inflicted on her the humiliation of a terrible\r\npublic indictment, was reckoned only as retributive human justice.\r\n\r\nLydie knew well enough that the crowd which surrounded her--though\r\nhere usually composed of friends--was only too ready to believe evil,\r\nhowever crying, against a woman placed so highly in Royal and social\r\nfavour as she herself had been for years. Already she could hear the\r\nmurmur of condemnation round her, and that from people who should\r\nhave known that she was quite incapable of committing the base\r\ntreachery attributed to her.\r\n\r\nOf course she had not denied it. She could not have denied it, in the\r\nface of the wording of the accusation itself.\r\n\r\nAnd she felt herself hideously and morally guilty, guilty in the facts\r\nthough not in the spirit. As Irène had put it crudely and simply, she\r\nhad handed over to Gaston de Stainville in the privacy of the Park of\r\nVersailles the secret which would deliver the Stuart prince into the\r\nhands of his enemies.\r\n\r\nHow could she begin to explain to all these people that her motive had\r\nbeen good and pure, her orders to Gaston altogether different from\r\nthose imputed to her by Irène? No one would have believed her\r\nexplanation unless Gaston too spoke the truth. And Gaston meant to be\r\nan infamous liar to the end.\r\n\r\nShe had been the tool of that clique, it was they now who were ready\r\nto cast her aside, to break her power and ultimately to throw her on\r\nthe heap of social refuse, where other traitors, liars and cheats\r\nmouldered away in obscurity.\r\n\r\nAlready she knew what the end would be, already she tasted the bitter\r\nfruit of waning popularity.\r\n\r\nQuite a crowd of obvious sympathizers gathered round the Comte and\r\nComtesse de Stainville. Gaston's avowedly base conduct was--it\r\nseems--to be condoned. At best he stood branded by his own\r\nwife--unwittingly perhaps--as having betrayed a woman who for right or\r\nwrong, had trusted him, but it is strange to record that, in this era\r\nof petticoat rule, the men were always more easily forgiven their\r\nfaults than the women.\r\n\r\nLydie found herself almost alone, only Monsieur de Louvois came and\r\nspoke to her on an official matter, and presently Monsieur le Duc\r\nd'Aumont joined them.\r\n\r\n\"Will you let me take you back to your apartments, Lydie?\" urged\r\nMonsieur le Duc. \"I fear the excitement has seriously upset you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think I have been to blame, father dear?\" she asked quite gently.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! . . .\" he murmured vaguely.\r\n\r\n\"You did not speak up for me when that woman accused me . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear child,\" he said evasively, \"you had not taken me into your\r\nconfidence. I thought . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"You still think,\" she insisted, \"that what Madame de Stainville said\r\nwas true?\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it?\" he asked blandly.\r\n\r\nHe did not understand this mood of hers at all. Was she trying to\r\ndeny? Impossible surely! She was a clever woman, and with the map and\r\nher own letter, sealed and signed with her name, what was the good of\r\ndenying?\r\n\r\n\"Your own letter and the map, my child,\" he added with gentle\r\nreproach, thinking that she feared to trust him completely.\r\n\r\n\"Ah yes! my own letter!\" she murmured, \"the map . . . I had\r\nforgotten.\"\r\n\r\nNo! she did not mean to deny! She could not deny! . . . Her own father\r\nbelieved her guilty . . . and all she could have done would have been\r\nto urge the purity of her motive. Gaston had of course destroyed her\r\norders to the command of _Le Monarque_ and there was only the map\r\n. . . and that awful, awful letter.\r\n\r\nMonsieur le Duc thought that his daughter had been very unwise.\r\nHaving trusted Gaston, and placed herself as it were in his hands, she\r\nwas foolish to anger him. No man--if he have the faintest pretension\r\nto being called an honourable gentleman--however smitten he might be\r\nwith another woman's charms, will allow his wife to be publicly\r\ninsulted by her rival. No doubt Lydie had been jealous of Irène, whose\r\nsomewhat indiscreet advances to milor Eglinton had aroused universal\r\ncomment. But Lydie did not even pretend to care for her own husband\r\nand she had yielded her most treasured secret to Gaston de Stainville.\r\nThere she should have remained content and not have provoked Irène's\r\nwrath, and even perhaps a revulsion of feeling in Gaston himself.\r\n\r\nUnlike King Louis, Monsieur le Duc d'Aumont did not approve of his\r\ndaughter's name being associated with the treacherous scheme from\r\nwhich he was ready enough to profit financially himself, although in\r\nthe innermost depths of his heart he disapproved of it. He knew his\r\nRoyal master well enough to be fully aware of the fact that, when the\r\nwhole nefarious transaction came to light, Louis would find means of\r\nposing before the public as the unwilling tool of a gang of\r\nmoney-grabbers. When that happened, every scornful finger would of\r\nnecessity--remembering the events of this night--point at Lydie, and\r\nincidentally at her father, as the prime movers of the scheme.\r\n\r\nIt had been far better to have conciliated Irène and not to have\r\nangered Gaston.\r\n\r\nBut women were strange creatures, and jealousy their most autocratic\r\nmaster. Even his daughter whom he had thought so exceptional, so\r\nclever and so clear-headed, was not free from the weaknesses of her\r\nsex.\r\n\r\n\"Methinks, my dear,\" he said kindly, \"you have not acted as wisely as\r\nI should have expected. Madame de Stainville, on my honour, hath not\r\nwronged you so as to deserve a public affront, and Gaston himself only\r\ndesired to serve you.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur le Duc must have raised his voice more than he intended, or\r\nelse perhaps there had occurred quite suddenly in the crowd of\r\nsympathizers, that now stood in a dense group round Madame de\r\nStainville, one of those inevitable moments of complete silence when\r\nangels are said to be fluttering round the room. Certain it is that\r\nMonsieur le Duc's words sang out somewhat loudly, and were heard by\r\nthose whose names had been on his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Nay! I entreat you, Monsieur le Duc,\" came in light, bantering\r\naccents from Gaston de Stainville, \"do not chide your fair daughter.\r\nBelieve me, we who have suffered most are not inclined to be severe.\r\nAs to me the psychology of Madame la Marquise's mood has been\r\nprofoundly interesting, since it hath revealed her to the astonished\r\ngaze of her many admirers, as endowed with some of the weaknesses of\r\nher adorable sex. Why should we complain of these charming weaknesses?\r\nFor though we might be very hard hit thereby, they are but expressions\r\nof flattery soothing to our pride.\"\r\n\r\nThe groups had parted somewhat as he spoke, leaving him face to face\r\nwith Lydie, towards whom he advanced with an affected gait and mincing\r\nsteps, looking at her with mocking eyes, whilst toying gracefully with\r\nthe broad black ribbon that held his eyeglass.\r\n\r\nBut Gaston's were not the only sarcastic glances that were levelled at\r\nLydie. His fatuous innuendoes were unmistakable, and bore out the\r\nbroader and more shameful accusation hurled by Irène. Lydie's own\r\nattitude, her every action to-night, the expression of her face at\r\nthis moment seemed to prove them true. She retreated a little as he\r\nadvanced, and, doing so, she raised her head with that proud toss\r\nwhich was habitual to her.\r\n\r\nThus her eyes travelled swiftly across the room, and she saw her\r\nhusband standing some distance away. She, too, like King Louis,\r\nwondered how much he had heard, how much he knew: and knowing all,\r\nwhat he meant to do. Instinctively when she caught sight of him, and\r\nthen once more saw Gaston de Stainville drawing nearer to her, she\r\nremembered that warning which milor had given her that morning, and\r\nwhich she had thought so futile, anent the loathsome reptile that,\r\nonce touched, would pollute for ever.\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" said Gaston now, as he boldly approached her, \"my friends\r\nhere would tell me no doubt that, by every code of social honour, my\r\nduty is to punish you or someone who would represent you in this\r\nmatter, for the affront done to my wife. But how can I do that since\r\nthe offender is fair as well as frail? My desire is not to punish, but\r\nrather to thank you on my knees for the delicate compliment implied by\r\nyour actions to-night. I knew that you honoured me by trusting in me,\"\r\nhe added with obvious significance, \"but I had not hoped to provoke\r\nsuch flattering jealousy in the heart of the most statuesque woman in\r\nFrance.\"\r\n\r\nA titter went round the room. Gaston's attitude seemed suddenly to\r\nhave eased the tension, as of an impending tragedy, which had hung\r\nover the brilliant assembly for the last half hour. Monsieur le Comte\r\nwas such a dreadful _mauvais sujet_ but so delightful in his ways, so\r\ndelicately refined in his wickedness! He was quite right to take the\r\nmatter lightly, and a murmur of approval followed the titter, at the\r\ntact with which he had lifted the load of apprehension from the minds\r\nof the company.\r\n\r\nMadame la Marquise d'Eglinton was something of a fool to take the\r\nmatter so thoroughly _au tragique_. No doubt the affairs of the Stuart\r\nprince would right themselves presently, and she certainly should have\r\nhad more regard for her willing and obviously devoted accomplice.\r\n\r\nHe looked so superlatively elegant and handsome now, the younger women\r\nsighed whilst they admired him. He pointed his toe and held out his\r\ntricorne in the manner prescribed by fashion for the making of a bow,\r\nand it was most unfortunate that he was so suddenly stopped in the\r\nvery midst of his graceful flourish by a quiet and suave voice which\r\ncame immediately from behind him.\r\n\r\n\"I would not do that, were I in your red-heeled shoes, my good\r\nStainville. A slip on this highly-polished floor is certain to be the\r\nresult.\"\r\n\r\nBut even before the gentle echo of these blandly spoken words had\r\npenetrated to the further ends of the room, Monsieur le Comte de\r\nStainville had measured his full length face downward on the ground.\r\n\r\nHis fall was so instantaneous that he had not the time to save himself\r\nwith his hands, and he was literally sprawling now at Lydie's feet\r\nwith arms and legs stretched out, his face having come in violent\r\ncontact with the polished floor. Quite close to him Lord Eglinton was\r\nstanding, laughing softly and discreetly and looking down on the\r\nprostrate and distinctly inelegant figure of the handsome cavalier.\r\n\r\nA ripple of merry laughter followed this unexpected turn of events.\r\nOne or two spectators, who had stood quite close at the very moment\r\nthat the catastrophe occurred, declared subsequently that milor had\r\nwith a quick action of his foot thrown Monsieur de Stainville off his\r\nbalance; the intense slipperiness of the parquet having merely done\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, the laughter of necessity was prudently suppressed,\r\nfor already Gaston had picked himself up and there was that in his\r\nface which warned all those present that the farce--such as it\r\nwas--would prove the prelude to real and serious tragedy.\r\n\r\n\"There now,\" said Lord Eglinton blandly, \"did I not warn you, Monsieur\r\nle Comte? Graceful flourishes are apt to be treacherous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Milor. . .\" said Gaston, who was livid with rage.\r\n\r\n\"Hush--sh--sh,\" interrupted milor in the same even and gentle voice,\r\n\"not in the presence of ladies. . . . An you desire, Monsieur le\r\nComte, I'll be at your service later on.\"\r\n\r\nThen he turned toward his wife, bowing low, but not in the least as\r\nGaston de Stainville would have bowed, for he had inherited from his\r\nfather all the stiffness of manner peculiar to the Anglo-Saxon race.\r\n\r\nThus at this moment he looked distinctly gauche, though not without\r\ndignity, as, his back slightly bent, his left arm outstretched, he\r\nwaited until Lydie chose to place her hand on his sleeve.\r\n\r\n\"Your seconds, milor,\" shouted Gaston, who seemed quite unable to\r\ncontrol himself, and who had to be distinctly and even determinedly\r\nheld back by two of his friends from springing then and there at Lord\r\nEglinton's throat.\r\n\r\n\"They will wait on yours to-night, Monsieur le Comte,\" replied _le\r\npetit Anglais_ affably. \"Madame la Marquise, will you honour me?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Lydie took his arm and allowed him to lead her out of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nHUSBAND AND WIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nMonsieur Achille was waiting in the vestibule of the Queen's\r\napartments. As soon as Lord and Lady Eglinton appeared his majestic\r\nfigure detached itself from the various groups of flunkeys, who stood\r\nabout desultorily pending the breaking up of Her Majesty's Court; he\r\nhad a cloak over his arm, and, at a sign from his master he approached\r\nand handed him the cloak which milor then placed round his wife's\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Do you desire to sleep in Versailles to-night, Madame?\" he asked, \"my\r\ncoach is below in case you wished to drive to Château d'Aumont.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you, milor,\" she said, \"I would wish to remain in\r\nVersailles.\"\r\n\r\nThen she added with a pathetic sigh of bitterness:\r\n\r\n\"My father would prefer it, I think. He is not prepared for my visit.\r\nAnd I do not interfere with your lordship's arrangements. . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in the least, Madame,\" he rejoined quietly. \"The corridors are\r\ninterminable; would you like a chair?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. . . . Let us walk,\" she said curtly.\r\n\r\nWithout further comment he once more offered her his arm. She took it\r\nand together they descended the monumental staircase and then turned\r\nalong the endless, vast corridors which lead to the West Wing.\r\nMonsieur Achille followed at a respectful distance, and behind him\r\nwalked two flunkeys, also in the gorgeous scarlet and gold Eglinton\r\nlivery, whilst two more bearing torches preceded Monsieur le Marquis\r\nand Madame, lighting them on their way.\r\n\r\nOn the way to the West Wing, milor talked lightly of many things: of\r\nMonsieur de Voltaire's latest comedy, and the quaint new fashion in\r\nheadgear, of His Majesty the King of Prussia and of the pictures of\r\nMonsieur Claude Gelée. He joked about the Duchesse de Pontchartrain's\r\nattempts at juvenility and Monsieur Crébillon's pretensions to a place\r\namong the Immortals. Lydie answered in monosyllables; she could not\r\nbring herself to speak, although she quite appreciated milor's desire\r\nto appear natural and unconcerned before his own lacqueys.\r\n\r\nA great resolution was taking root in her mind, and she only wanted\r\nthe privacy and the familiarity of her own apartments to put it into\r\nexecution. Thus they reached the West Wing.\r\n\r\nArrived in the antechamber whence her rooms branched off to the right\r\nand milor's to the left, Lord Eglinton stopped, disengaged her arm\r\nfrom his and was about to bid her an elaborate good-night, when she\r\nsaid abruptly:\r\n\r\n\"May I speak with you privately and in your own study, milor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, Madame,\" he replied seemingly a little astonished at her\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nHe dismissed all the flunkeys with the exception of Monsieur Achille,\r\nwho led the way through the reception rooms toward milor's private\r\nsuite. Lord and Lady Eglinton followed in silence now. The rooms\r\nseemed strangely silent and deserted, ghostlike too, for there was no\r\nartificial light, and the moon peered in through the tall windows,\r\nthrowing patches of pale mauve and weird, translucent greens on the\r\nparquet floor and the brocade coverings of the chairs.\r\n\r\nIn milor's study, Monsieur Achille lighted the candles in two massive\r\ncandelabra, which stood on the secrétaire, then, at a nod from his\r\nmaster, he walked backward out of the room.\r\n\r\nThe heavy portière fell back with a curious sound like a moan, and for\r\nthe third time to-day husband and wife stood face to face alone. The\r\ngaucherie of his manner became at once apparent now: yet he seemed in\r\nno way bashful or ill as ease, only very stiff and awkward in his\r\nmovements, as he drew a chair for her at a convenient angle, and when\r\nshe had sat down, placed a cushion to her back and a footstool at her\r\nfeet. He himself remained standing.\r\n\r\n\"I pray you sit, milor,\" she said with a quick sigh, that trembled as\r\nit escaped her lips, \"and if I have not angered you beyond the bounds\r\nof your patience, I earnestly ask you to bear with me, for if I have\r\nbeen at fault I have also suffered much and . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" he said quite gently if somewhat coldly, \"might I entreat of\r\nyou not to insist on this interview if it distresses you very much; as\r\nto a fault . . . on my honour, Madame, the very thought of\r\nself-accusation on your part seems to me wildly preposterous.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not sit as she had asked him to do, but stood looking down at\r\nher and thinking--thinking alas!--that she never had been quite so\r\nbeautiful. She was almost as white as her gown, the powder still clung\r\nto her hair, which, in the dim light of the candles, chose to hide the\r\nglory of its ardent colour beneath the filmy artificial veil. She wore\r\nsome exquisite pearls, his gift on the day of her marriage: row upon\r\nrow of these exquisite gems fell on her throat and bosom, both as\r\nwhite, as glittering and pure as the priceless treasures from the\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\nThe chair in which she sat was covered with damask of a rich dull\r\ngold, and against this background with its bright lights and\r\nimpenetrably dark shadows, the white figure stood out like what he had\r\nalways pictured her, a cold and unapproachable statue.\r\n\r\nBut to-night, though so still and white, the delicate marble had taken\r\nunto itself life: the life which means sorrow. All the haughtiness of\r\nthe look had vanished; there were deep shadows under the eyes and\r\nlines of suffering round the perfectly chiselled lips.\r\n\r\nHenry Dewhyrst, Marquis of Eglinton, was not yet thirty: he loved this\r\nexquisitely beautiful woman with all his heart and soul, and she had\r\nnever been anything more to him than a perfectly carved image would be\r\non the high altar of a cathedral. She had been neither helpmate nor\r\nwife, only an ideal, an intangible shadow which his love had not\r\nsucceeded in materializing.\r\n\r\nAs he looked at her now, he wondered for the first time in the course\r\nof their married life, if it had been his own fault that they had\r\nremained such complete strangers: this was because for the first time\r\nto-day a great sorrow, a still greater shame had breathed life into\r\nthe marble-like statue.\r\n\r\nAll at once he felt deeply, unutterably sorry for her; he had no\r\nthought of her wrongs toward him, only of those done to herself by her\r\npride and the faults of the epoch in which she lived.\r\n\r\n\"Milor,\" she said trying to steady her voice, \"it would ease me a\r\nlittle--and ease the painfulness of this interview--if you were to\r\ntell me at what precise moment you entered Her Majesty's throne-room\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say, Madame,\" he replied with the ghost of a smile; \"I did\r\nnot look at the clock, but I was in attendance on His Majesty and\r\ntherefore . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"You heard what passed between Madame la Comtesse de Stainville and\r\nmyself?\" she interrupted hastily.\r\n\r\n\"Every word.\"\r\n\r\nSomehow she felt relieved. She would have hated to recapitulate that\r\nvulgar scene, the mutual recriminations, the insults, culminating in\r\nHer Majesty's contemptuous exit from the room. She could not now see\r\nher husband's face, for he had contrived to stand so as to allow the\r\nlight from the candelabra to fall full upon her, whilst he himself,\r\nsilhouetted against the light, remained in the shadow; but there was a\r\ncertain dignified repose about the whole figure, the white, slender\r\nhand resting lightly on the bureau, the broad shoulders square and\r\nstraight, suggesting physical strength, and the simple, somewhat sober\r\nstyle and cut of the clothes.\r\n\r\nThe room too appeared as a complete contrast to the other apartments\r\nof the palace of Versailles, where the mincing fancies of Watteau and\r\nthe artificialities of Boucher had swept aside the nobler conceptions\r\nof Girardon and Mansard. It was quite plainly furnished, with\r\nstraight-back chairs and hangings of dull gold, and the leather\r\ncovering of the bureau gave ample signs of wear.\r\n\r\nThe turmoil in Lydie's heart subsided, yielding itself to peace in the\r\nmidst of these peaceful surroundings. She was able to conquer the\r\ntremor of her voice, the twitch of her lips, and to swallow down the\r\nburning tears of humiliation which blinded her eyes and obscured her\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n\"Then, milor, it will indeed be easier for me. You understand of what\r\nI am charged, the awful load of disgrace and shame which by my own\r\nfolly I have placed upon my shoulders . . . you understand,\" and her\r\nvoice, though steady, sunk to a whisper, \"that I have proved unworthy\r\nof the confidence which the unfortunate Stuart prince, who was your\r\nfriend, placed in me as well as in you?\"\r\n\r\nHe did not reply, waiting for her to continue. Her head had drooped\r\nand a heavy tear fell from her sunken lids upon her hands. To him who\r\nloved her, and whom she had so deeply wronged, there was a strange yet\r\npainful joy in watching her cry.\r\n\r\n\"What Madame de Stainville said to-night is true,\" she added\r\ntonelessly. \"I gave into Monsieur de Stainville's hands the map, with\r\nfull marginal notes and description of the place where the Stuart\r\nprince is hiding; I also gave him a letter written and signed by me,\r\naddressed to Prince Charles Edward Stuart, begging him to trust\r\nimplicitly his own royal person and that of his friends to the bearer\r\nof my note. That letter and the plan are even now in the hands of His\r\nMajesty, who purposes to accept the proposals of His Grace the Duke of\r\nCumberland, and to sell the Stuart prince to his foes for the sum of\r\nfifteen million livres. And that is all true.\"\r\n\r\nKnowing men, the men of her world, she fully expected that this\r\nconfession of hers would cause her husband's just wrath to break\r\nthrough that barrier of courteous good-breeding and self-restraint,\r\nimposed on all men of honour when in the presence of women, and which\r\nshe firmly believed had alone prevented him from interfering between\r\nherself and Irène. She would not have been astonished if he had\r\nstormed and raged, loudly accused and condemned her, nay!--she had\r\nheard of such things--if he had laid hands on her. But when, hearing\r\nnothing, she looked up, she saw that he had scarcely moved, only the\r\nhand which still rested on the secrétaire trembled a little. Perhaps\r\nher look made him conscious of that, for he withdrew it, and then\r\nseemed to pull himself together, and draw himself up, straight and\r\nrigid like a soldier on parade.\r\n\r\n\"Having told you this, milor,\" she resumed after a slight pause, \"I\r\nshould like to add that I am fully aware that in your eyes there can\r\nbe no excuse possible for what I did, since in doing it I have\r\nsacrificed the life of a man who trusted us--you and me, milor--more\r\neven than he did France. He and his friends, by my act, will leave the\r\nshelter of their retreat, and will be delivered into the hands of\r\nthose who cannot do aught, for political and self-protective reasons,\r\nbut send them to the scaffold. You see, milor, I do not palliate my\r\noffence, nor do I seek your pardon--although I know that you will look\r\non what I have done as a disgrace brought by your wife upon your name.\r\nI deserve no pardon, and I ask for none. But if there is no excuse for\r\nmy conduct, at least do I owe you an explanation, and for this I crave\r\nyour attention if you would care to listen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, Madame, you do but jest,\" he rejoined, \"you owe me nothing . . .\r\nnot even an explanation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet you will listen?\" she urged.\r\n\r\n\"It would be only painful to us both, Madame.\"\r\n\r\n\"You prefer to think of me as ignoble, treacherous and base,\" she said\r\nwith sudden vehemence, \"you do not wish to know for certain and from\r\nmy own lips that Gaston de Stainville . . .\"\r\n\r\nShe paused abruptly and bit her lips, he watching her keenly, she not\r\nknowing that she was watched.\r\n\r\nThis was going to be a fight and he knew it, a dire conflict between\r\ndistress and pride. At first he had hoped that she was prepared to\r\nyield, that she had sought this interview because the load of sorrow\r\nand of humiliation being more than she could bear, she had turned\r\ninstinctively to the only man in the world who could ease and comfort\r\nher: whose boundless, untiring love was ready to share the present\r\npain, as it had shrunk from participating in the glories of the past.\r\nBut as she spoke, as she sat there before him now, white, passive,\r\ndisdainful even in her self-abasement, he knew that his hour--Love's\r\nhour--had not yet struck. Pride was not yet conquered.\r\n\r\nThe dominant ruler of a lifetime will not abdicate very readily, and\r\nthough distress and sorrow are powerful opponents, they are more\r\ntransient, more easily cast aside than Pride.\r\n\r\n\"As you say, milor,\" she now said more quietly, \"the matter is only\r\npainful to us both. I understand that your estimate of me is not an\r\nexalted one. You despise--you probably hate me! Well! so be it. Let us\r\nnot think of our own feelings in this matter, milor! I entreat you to\r\nignore my very existence for the time being, only thinking of the\r\nStuart prince and of his dire peril!\r\n\r\n\"'Tis because of him I have begged for this interview,\" she resumed\r\nwith just a thought of that commanding manner, which she was wont to\r\nassume whenever matters of public import were discussed: \"I need not\r\nreiterate the fact that he is in deadly danger. _Le Levantin_, a fast\r\nbrigantine, milor, is even now being equipped by His Majesty for the\r\nnefarious expedition. _Le Levantin_ or perhaps _Le Monarque_--the\r\nlatter is quite ready to sail at any time, and with the map and my\r\nletter it will be easy . . . oh! so easy! . . . Oh!\" she added with a\r\nsudden uncontrollable outburst of passionate appeal, \"milor, he was\r\nyour friend . . . can nothing be done? . . . can nothing be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know, madame,\" he replied coldly, \"how should I?\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely, surely you remember your promise to him, milor,\" she said\r\nimpatient at his coldness, unable to understand this lack of\r\nenthusiasm. \"You remember that night, in the Château d'Aumont--the\r\nbanquet . . . his farewell to you . . . his trust, his confidence\r\n. . . the assurance you gave him . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"So much has occurred since then, Madame,\" he said simply. \"The\r\nguidance of affairs has been in your hands. . . . I have lost what\r\nlittle grasp I ever had of the situation. . . . As you know, I am\r\nneither clever nor strong--and I have only too gladly relied on abler\r\nwits than mine own. . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"But your promise,\" she urged, with real passion ringing in her voice,\r\n\"your promise to him. . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"I made a far more solemn one to you, madame, never to interfere in\r\nmatters of State.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll release you of that,\" she cried impulsively; \"think, milor . . .\r\nI entreat you to think! . . . there must be some way out of this\r\nterrible labyrinth . . . there must be some one whom you can trust\r\n. . .\"\r\n\r\nShe checked herself, and a quick hot blush rose to her cheeks. She\r\nthought that she had detected a quick flash in his eyes at these last\r\nwords of hers, a flash which had caused that sudden rush of blood to\r\nher temples, but which was extinguished almost as soon as it arose: he\r\nsaid quite naturally and tonelessly:\r\n\r\n\"There is no one. How could there be?\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely, surely,\" she repeated with growing, obstinate vehemence,\r\n\"you can think of something to do . . . you have the means . . . you\r\nare rich . . . have you no enthusiasms, milor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! . . .\" he said deprecatingly, \"so few! . . . they are scarce\r\nworthy of the name. . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"No thought how to help your friend who is in fear and peril of his\r\nlife? . . . Heavens above us, what are the men of France? Wooden dolls\r\nor . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"That what the women of France have made them, Madame,\" he said\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\n\"Then you have no thought, or initiative how to help your friend?\" she\r\nretorted.\r\n\r\nHe had noted the ring of scorn in her voice, the return of that\r\nhaughty and obstinate self-will, which would for ever stand between\r\nher and happiness. His expression suddenly hardened, as he looked at\r\nher flashing eyes and the contemptuous curl of the exquisite lips, all\r\nthe gentleness went out of his face, the latent tenderness which she\r\nhad wilfully ignored, and his voice, no longer softly mocking, became\r\nhard and bitter in its tones.\r\n\r\n\"I?\" he said with a slight uplifting of his brow and a\r\nself-deprecating droop of the lip, \"surely, Madame, you are pleased to\r\njest. I am no statesman, no politician, I scarce have a sufficiency\r\nof brains to be a figure head in an administration. I have never been\r\ntaught to think.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mocking me, milor,\" she said haughtily.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is further from my thoughts. I have far too much respect for\r\nyour ladyship to venture on either mockery or individual thought.\"\r\n\r\nShe paused awhile, frowning and impatient, angered beyond bounds, too,\r\nat his attitude, which she was quite clever enough to see did not\r\nrepresent the true state of his mind. No doubt he desired to punish\r\nher for her contempt of him that morning. She would have liked to read\r\nthe expression in his face, to know something of what was going on\r\nbehind that straight, handsome brow, and the eyes always so gentle,\r\nyet so irritating now in this semblance of humility. She thought\r\ncertainly that the outline of the jaw suggested obstinacy--the\r\nobstinacy of the inherently weak. If she had not wanted his help so\r\nmuch, she would have left him then and there, in scorn and in wrath,\r\nonly too glad that sentiment had not led her into more excuses or\r\nexplanations--a prayer for forgiveness mayhap. She was not a little\r\nirritated with herself too, for she felt that she had made a wrong\r\nstart: she was quite sure that his supineness, at any rate with regard\r\nto the fate of the Stuart prince, was assumed. There must be a way of\r\nappealing to that loyalty which she knew he cherished for his friend,\r\nsome means of breaking down that barrier of resentment which he had\r\nevidently set up against her.\r\n\r\nOh! if it had been a few months ago, when he still loved her, before\r\nIrène de Stainville. . . She paused in this train of thought, her mind\r\nnot daring to travel further along it; it was such a wide, such a\r\nglorious possibility that that one little \"if\" suggested, that her\r\nheart quivered with renewed agony, and the weak tears, of which she\r\nwas so ashamed, insisted on coming to her eyes.\r\n\r\nIf only his love for her was not dead, how easy her task would have\r\nbeen! It would have fired him to enthusiasm now, caused him to forget\r\nhis resentment against her in this great work yet to be accomplished,\r\nand instead of asking him for passive help she could have incited him\r\nto a deed of loyalty and of courage. But now she was too proud to\r\ncontinue her appeal: she thought that she had done her best, and had\r\nnot even succeeded in breaking through the icy reserve and resentment\r\nwhich in his heart had taken the place of silent and humble worship.\r\n\r\n\"Milor,\" she said with sudden determination, and in the authoritative\r\nmanner which was more habitual to her than the more emotional,\r\npassionately appealing mood, \"with your leave we'll cease these\r\nunworthy bickerings. I may have been hasty in my actions this morning.\r\nIf so I pray you not to vent your anger against your friend. If I have\r\nwronged you by taking you at your word, when a year ago you told me\r\nthat you would never wish to interfere in my official work, well! I\r\nhumbly beg you pardon, and again entreat you not to allow your friend\r\nto expiate the sins of your wife. You say that the men of France are\r\nwhat the women have made them; there I think that you are wrong--at\r\nleast in this: that in your mind the word woman stands for those of\r\nthe sex who are pure and loyal as well as those for who are not. It is\r\nnot the women of France who have made the men, milor, rather it is the\r\nmen who--looking to the Pompadours, the Irène de Stainvilles, not only\r\nfor companionship and for pleasure, but also, heaven help them! for\r\nideals--have made the women what they are! But enough of this. You no\r\ndoubt think me wordy and tedious, and neither understand, nor wish to\r\nunderstand that there may be honour and chivalry in a far greater\r\ndegree in the heart of a woman, than in that of the more selfish sex.\r\nI have asked for your advice in all simplicity and loyalty,\r\nacknowledging the sin I have committed and asking you to help me in\r\natoning for it, in a way useful to your friend. This appeal for advice\r\nyou have met with sneers and bitter mockery: on my soul, milor if I\r\ncould now act without your assistance I would do so, for in all the\r\nhumiliation which I have had to endure to-day, none has been more\r\ngalling or more hard to bear believe me, than that which I must now\r\nendure through finding myself, in a matter essentially vital to my\r\nheart and even to my reason, dependent upon your help.\"\r\n\r\nHe could hear her voice trembling a little in spite of her efforts at\r\nself-control. He knew quite well that at this moment she spoke the\r\ntruth, and these last words of hers, which for many a long day\r\nafterward rang persistently in his ears, represented to him ever\r\nafterward the very acme of mental--aye! and physical--pain which one\r\nhuman being could inflict on another. At the time it absolutely seemed\r\nunendurable: it seemed to him that under the blow, thus coldly dealt\r\nby those same beautiful lips, for which his own ached with an\r\nintensity of passionate longing, either his life or his reason must\r\ngive way. The latter probably, for life is more tenacious and more\r\ncruel in its tenacity: yet if reason went, then Heaven alone could\r\nhelp him, for he would either kill her or outrage her beyond the hope\r\nof pardon.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore, milor,\" she resumed after a slight pause, unconscious\r\nevidently of the intense cruelty of her words, \"I will beg of you not\r\nto make it harder for me than need be. I must ask this help from you,\r\nin order to succeed, if humanly possible, in outwitting the infamous\r\nwork of a gang of traitors. Will you, at least, give me this help I\r\nneed?\"\r\n\r\n\"If it lies within my power,\" he replied; \"I pray you to command\r\nMadame.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am thinking of sending a messenger post haste to the commander of\r\n_Le Monarque_ with orders to set sail at once for Scotland,\" she\r\ncontinued in matter-of-fact tones. \"I should want a fresh copy of the\r\nmap where Prince Charles Edward is in hiding, and to make assurance\r\ndoubly sure a letter from you to the prince, asking him to trust\r\nCaptain Barre implicitly. _Le Monarque_ I know can reach Scotland long\r\nere _Le Levantin_ is ready for sea, and my idea had been originally to\r\ncommission her to take the prince and his friends on board, and then\r\nto skirt the west coast of Ireland, reaching Brittany or mayhap the\r\nPyrenees by a circuitous route. I have firm belief that it is not too\r\nlate to send this messenger, milor, and thus to put my original plan\r\ninto execution. And if you will give me a new map and full directions\r\nand your signet ring for the prince, I feel confident that I can find\r\nsomeone whom I could thoroughly trust . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no one whom you could thoroughly trust with such an errand,\r\nMadame!\" he said drily.\r\n\r\n\"I must risk that, milor. The crisis has become so acute that I must\r\ndo something to avert that awful catastrophe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Betrayal would be the inevitable result.\"\r\n\r\n\"I entreat you to leave that to me,\" she urged firmly. \"I know I can\r\nfind someone, all I ask is for the map, and a word and signet ring\r\nfrom you.\"\r\n\r\nShe was leaning forward now, eager and enthusiastic again, self-willed\r\nand domineering, determined that he should do what she wished. Her\r\neyes were glowing, the marble was indeed endowed with life; she\r\ngleamed like a jewel, white and fragile-looking, in this dull and\r\nsombre room, and he forgetting for the moment her cruelty of awhile\r\nago was loth to let her go, to speak the harsh words which anon would\r\nhave to be said, and which would send her resentful, contemptuous,\r\nperhaps heartbroken, out of his sight again.\r\n\r\nWould it not have been ten thousand times more simple to throw pride,\r\njust anger, reason to the winds, to fall at those exquisite feet, to\r\nencircle that glittering marble with passionately tremulous arms, to\r\nswear fealty, slavery, obedience to her whims.\r\n\r\nHow she would smile, and how softly and tenderly would the flush of\r\nvictory tinge those pale cheeks with delicate rose! to see it\r\ngradually chase away the pearl-like tone of her skin, to see her eyes\r\nbrighten at his word, to feel perhaps the tiny hand tremble with joy\r\nas it lay for sheer gratitude a few brief seconds in his, was not that\r\nwell worth the barren victory of a man's pride over a woman's\r\nself-will?\r\n\r\nShe had thought that he would have yielded at her first word, would at\r\nonce have fawned at her feet, kissing her hand, swearing that he was\r\nher slave. He had done it once . . . a year ago, and why not now\r\nagain? Then she had smiled on him, had allowed him to kneel, to kiss\r\nher gown, anon had yielded her cold fingers to his kiss; he had reaped\r\na year of misery for that one moment's joy, and now, just for the\r\nspace of a few seconds he was again assailed with an awful temptation\r\nto throw prudence and pride away, to enjoy one golden hour--less\r\nperhaps--but glorious and fulsome whilst it lasted, until it gave way\r\nonce more to humiliation, far worse to bear than heretofore.\r\n\r\nThe temptation for those few brief seconds was overwhelming, and 'twas\r\nfortunate that he stood in shadow, else she had seen signs of an awful\r\nconflict in that young and handsome face which she had been wont to\r\nsee so gentle and so placid. But he knew that in her, pride had by now\r\nabsolutely got the upper hand: sorrow had laid down her arms and\r\nconstituted herself a prisoner of war, following meekly behind the\r\ntriumphal chariot of her conquering rival.\r\n\r\nAnd because of that, because he knew that there was not one spark yet\r\nin her heart which Love had kindled, that Love itself was still lying\r\ndormant within her, gagged and bound even in his sleep, kept in\r\nsubjection thus pinioned and helpless by masterful self-will and by\r\nobstinate pride, he would not yield to the temptation of culling the\r\nDead Sea fruit, that would inevitably turn to ashes, even as his lips\r\nfirst tasted its fleeting, if intoxicating savour.\r\n\r\nShe had half risen from her chair leaning across the bureau, eager,\r\nexcited, tremulous, sure of victory. Paper and pen lay close to her\r\nhand, smiling she pointed to these:\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I pray you, milor,\" she said with passionate fervour, \"do not\r\ndelay! Every hour, every minute is precious . . . I swear to you that\r\nI'll find a messenger. He'll not know the purport of his errand. . . .\r\nOh! I assure you I'll play the part of indifference to perfection!\r\n. . . The packet to the commander of _Le Monarque_ will seem of the\r\nmost insignificant kind. . . . I'll not even order the messenger to\r\nhurry . . . just to guard the packet as inviolate as any secret of\r\nState. . . . Nay! hundreds of such messages have to be trusted to\r\nindifferent hands, in the course of a single transaction of the\r\nnation's business. Believe me, milor, there is not cause for fear! _Le\r\nMonarque_ can put to sea within an hour of receiving my orders, and\r\nPrince Charles Edward Stuart and his friends will be safely out of\r\nreach, ere _Le Levantin_ unfurls her sails, and pins to her masthead\r\nthe pennant of traitors. . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"But you do not speak, milor,\" she said suddenly changing the tone of\r\nher voice, all eagerness gone from her manner, a strange, nameless\r\nanxiety gripping her heart, \"will you not do this little I ask? . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible, Madame,\" he said curtly.\r\n\r\n\"Impossible? . . . Why? . . .\"\r\n\r\nHer voice now was harsh, trenchant, as it had been when she hurled a\r\nloud insult at Gaston de Stainville through his wife. She was on her\r\nfeet, tall and erect; a statue once more, white to the lips, cold and\r\nhaughty, rigid too, save for the slight trembling of her hands and the\r\ntremulous quiver of her mouth when she spoke.\r\n\r\nAs he did not reply to her question, she said impatiently:\r\n\r\n\"Will you give me a reason for this unexplainable refusal, milor?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I refuse, that is all.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is not your last word?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is my last word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you have me think that you are at one with the treacherous\r\nscheme, milor? and that you do not desire the safety of the Stuart\r\nprince?\"\r\n\r\nShe had raised her voice, boldly accusing him, inwardly knowing that\r\nthe accusation was groundless, yet wishing to goad him now into\r\npassion, into explanation, above all into acquiescence if it still lay\r\nin her power to force it.\r\n\r\nBut he took the insult with apparent calm, shrugged his shoulders and\r\nsaid quietly:\r\n\r\n\"As you please.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or is it . . . is it that you do not trust me? . . . that you think I\r\n. . . ?\"\r\n\r\nShe could not finish the sentence, nor put into words the awful\r\nsuggestion which had sprung like a stinging viper straight across the\r\ntrain of her thoughts. Her eyes dazed and burning tried to pierce the\r\ngloom wherein he stood, but the flickering light of the candles only\r\nthrew weird, fantastic gleams upon his face, which suddenly seemed\r\nstrange, unknown, incomprehensible to her. His figure appeared\r\npreternaturally tall, the sober gray of his coat looked like the pall\r\nof an avenging ghost. He was silent and had made no sign of protest,\r\nwhen she framed the terrible query.\r\n\r\nA bitter, an awful humiliation overwhelmed her. She felt as if right\r\nwithin her heart something had snapped and crumbled, which nothing on\r\nearth could ever set up again.\r\n\r\nShe said nothing more, but she could not altogether repress a\r\nheartbroken moan, which rose from the intensity of her mental agony.\r\n\r\nThen she turned and with head thrown back, with silent, trembling lips\r\nand half-closed eyes she walked slowly out of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nTHE FATE OF THE STUART PRINCE\r\n\r\n\r\nLydie hardly knew how she reached her apartments. Earlier in the day\r\nshe had thought once or twice that she had reached the deepest abyss\r\nof sorrow and humiliation into which it was possible for a woman of\r\npride to descend. When her husband first asked an explanation from\r\nher, and taxed her with lending an ear to the King's base proposals;\r\nwhen she found that her own father, whom she respected and loved, had\r\nhimself delved deeply in the mire of treachery; when she stood face to\r\nface with Gaston de Stainville and realized that he was an infamous\r\nliar and she a weak, confiding fool; when Irène had accused her\r\npublicly of scheming that which she would have given her life's blood\r\nto avert, all these were moments when she felt that the shame of them\r\nwas more than she could bear.\r\n\r\nYet how simple and childish, how paltry seemed the agony of those\r\nmental tortures in comparison with that she endured now.\r\n\r\nShe felt as if she had received a blow in the face, a blow which had\r\nleft a hideous, disfiguring mark on her which everyone henceforth\r\nwould see: the scarlet letter of ignominy with which in the New World\r\nbeyond the seas a puritanic inquisition branded the shameless\r\noutcasts. By her husband's silence rather than by his words she had\r\nbeen branded with a mark of infamy.\r\n\r\nYe saints and angels above, how terribly it hurt!\r\n\r\nYet why did she suffer so? Was it only because she had failed to\r\nobtain that which she almost begged for on her knees? Lydie, proud,\r\ndictatorial, domineering Lydie, felt that she had humiliated herself\r\nbeyond what she would have thought possible less than twelve hours\r\nago, and she had been refused.\r\n\r\nWas it that, that made her heart, her head, her very limbs ache with\r\nalmost unendurable agony?\r\n\r\nHer mind--though almost on the verge of madness--retained just one\r\nglimmer of reason. It answered \"No! the pain has deeper roots, more\r\nmysterious, at present incomprehensible, and death-dealing in their\r\ntenacity.\"\r\n\r\nHer husband thought that if he entrusted her with a letter for the\r\nStuart prince, she might use that letter for treacherous ends. That\r\nwas the reason of his refusal. He so hated, so despised her that his\r\nmind classed her as one of the most ignoble of her sex!\r\n\r\nWell! Awhile ago, in the Queen's antechamber, Irène de Stainville had\r\npublicly accused her of selling her royal friend for gold. Most people\r\nthere had believed Irène readily enough! That had hurt too, but not so\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nThen why this? Why these terrible thoughts which went hammering in her\r\nmind? whispers of peace to escape from this racking torture? peace\r\nthat could only be found in death!\r\n\r\n\"Great God, am I going mad?\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Achille had been accompanying Madame la Marquise on her way\r\nalong the corridors; he was carrying a candelabrum, wherein four wax\r\ncandles spluttered and flickered in the incessant draught. Lydie had\r\nbeen unconscious of the man's presence, but she had followed the\r\nlight mechanically, her eyes fixed on the four yellowish flames which\r\nlooked like mocking mouths that laughed, and emitted a trail of black\r\nsmoke, foul as the pestilential breath of shame.\r\n\r\nArrived at the door of her own antechamber, she was met by one of her\r\nliveried servants, who told her that Monsieur le Duc d'Aumont was\r\nwithin and awaiting to see her. To her hastily put query, the man\r\nreplied that Monsieur le Duc had arrived about half an hour ago, and,\r\nhearing that Madame la Marquise was closeted with milor, he had\r\nelected to wait.\r\n\r\nThis visit from her father at this hour of the night meant a grave\r\ncrisis, of course. At once Lydie's mind flew back to the Stuart\r\nprince. She had almost forgotten him since she left her husband's\r\nroom. It seemed as if the overwhelming misery of that silent and\r\ndeadly indictment had weighed down all other thoughts, until they sank\r\ninto complete insignificance.\r\n\r\nVaguely, too, she had the sensation that there was no immediate\r\nnecessity for her to rack her overtired brain to-night on the subject\r\nof the Jacobite's fate. She had at least six clear days before her,\r\nbefore _Le Levantin_, which was to start on the dire expedition, could\r\nbe ready to put to sea. There was _Le Monarque_, on the other hand,\r\nquite ready to sail within an hour of receiving her orders. And\r\nCaptain Barre was an honest man, a gallant sailor; he would only be\r\ntoo willing to make top speed in order to circumvent a treacherous\r\nplot, which he would abhor if he knew of it.\r\n\r\nTrue, Lydie had now no means of locating the fugitives exactly, but\r\nwith a six days' start of _Le Levantin_ this want of precise\r\nknowledge need not necessarily prove fatal. She could trust to her\r\nmemory somewhat, for she had repeatedly studied and fingered the map;\r\nshe could draw something approximate from memory, and Captain Barre's\r\ndetermination and enthusiasm would surely do the rest.\r\n\r\nThese suggestions all rushed into her mind directly she heard that her\r\nfather had come to visit her at this late hour. At first her desire\r\nwas to avoid seeing him at risk even of offending him: but in spite of\r\nall that she had gone through, Lydie still retained sufficient\r\npresence of mind not to allow any impulse to rule her at such a\r\ncritical moment. She forced herself to reflect on the Stuart prince\r\nand on him alone, on his danger and the treacherous plot against him,\r\nfor at least twenty seconds, time enough to realize that it was\r\nabsolutely necessary that she should see her father, in order to glean\r\nfrom him if possible every detail of the proposed expedition. She\r\nwould indeed be helpless if she remained in ignorance of what had been\r\nplanned between the King, Gaston, and her father. Perhaps--who\r\nknows?--in accordance with the habits of a lifetime, the Duke might\r\neven at this moment be anxious to consult his daughter--his helpmeet\r\nin all such matters--as to the final arrangements for the equipment of\r\n_Le Levantin_.\r\n\r\nSatisfied with her conclusions, she therefore went straight into the\r\nboudoir where the lacquey said that Monsieur le Duc was waiting.\r\n\r\nThe first look at his benign face proved to her that he, at least, was\r\nnot in any trouble. Whatever his daughter's views on the subject might\r\nbe, he evidently was not altogether dissatisfied with the events of\r\nthe day. He still wore a perturbed look, certainly; the scene which\r\nhad occurred in Her Majesty's throne-room would not tend to decrease\r\nhis mental worry; but beyond the slightly troubled look in his kindly\r\neyes, and the obvious solicitude with which he took her hand and led\r\nher to a low divan, he seemed fairly serene.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" he said in a tone of anxious query.\r\n\r\n\"Well, father dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your husband . . . what did he say?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, a little bewildered, with a stupid, vacant stare\r\nwhich puzzled him.\r\n\r\n\"What should he have said, father dear?\" she asked. \"I do not\r\nunderstand.\"\r\n\r\n\"About the fracas to-night, my child. Was he there when Irène de\r\nStainville spoke up so indiscreetly?\"\r\n\r\n\"No . . . no . . . I mean yes . . .\" she said vaguely, \"yes, milor was\r\nthere; he heard every word which Irène de Stainville said.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well? What did he say?\" he repeated with marked impatience. \"Lydie,\r\nmy child, this is not like you. . . . Cannot you see that I am\r\nanxious? . . . I have been waiting here for over an half hour in a\r\nperfect agony of uncertainty. . . . Your servants told me you were\r\ncloseted with milor. . . . You must tell me what he said.\"\r\n\r\n\"He said nothing, father,\" she replied simply.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur le Duc looked at her very keenly, but her eyes were clear now\r\nand met his straight and full. There was obviously no deceit there, no\r\ndesire to conceal more serious matters from him. He shrugged his\r\nshoulders, in token that he gave up all desire to understand. His\r\nson-in-law had always been a shadowy personality to him, and this\r\nattitude of his now, in face of the public scandal resting on his\r\nwife's name, was quite beyond Monsieur le Duc's comprehension.\r\n\r\nHad Lydie told him that her husband had heaped torrents of abuse on\r\nher, and had concluded a noisy scene by striking her, he would have\r\nbeen very angry, but he would have understood.\r\n\r\n\"Hm!\" he said placidly, \"these English are mad, of a truth; we men of\r\nhonour here cannot really comprehend them. Nevertheless, my dear\r\nLydie, I suppose I, as your father, must be thankful that he did not\r\nlay hands on you, for English husbands are notoriously brutal. You are\r\nquite sure that you have nothing to complain of in your husband's\r\nconduct?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite sure, father dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had come prepared to take you away with me. My coach is below and I\r\nam driving to Château d'Aumont to-night. Would you like to come?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to-night, dear,\" she replied serenely, and her father was glad to\r\nnote that a slight smile hovered round her lips. \"I am a little tired,\r\nand will go straight to bed. . . . But to-morrow I'll come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Permanently?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you will have me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well! until you go to your Château of Vincennes, you know my views on\r\nthat subject?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, father dear. . . . We will talk of that another time. . . . I am\r\nvery tired to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand that, my child,\" said Monsieur le Duc rather fussily\r\nnow, and clearing his throat, as if there was something which still\r\noppressed him and of which he would have liked to speak before leaving\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThere was that awkward pause, the result of a want of mutual\r\nunderstanding between two people who hitherto have been all in all to\r\neach other, but whom certain untoward events have suddenly drawn\r\napart. Lydie sincerely wished that her father would go. She had much\r\nto think about, a great deal to do, and the strain of keeping up a\r\nsemblance of serenity was very trying to her overwrought nerves. He on\r\nthe other hand felt uncomfortable in her presence: he left quite angry\r\nwith himself for not being able to discuss freely with her the subject\r\nmatter which was uppermost in his mind. There were one or two details\r\nin connection with the expedition to the Scottish coast that he very\r\nmuch wanted to talk over with his daughter. The habits of a lifetime\r\ngave him the desire to consult her about these details, just as he had\r\nbeen wont to do on all public and official matters. He had come to her\r\napartments chiefly for that purpose. Was she not at one with him, with\r\nthe King and Gaston over the scheme? She had given substantial proof\r\nthat she favoured the expedition. His Majesty had thanked her for her\r\nhelp: she had rendered such assistance as now made the whole affair\r\nnot only feasible but easy of accomplishment.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore passing strange that Monsieur le Duc d'Aumont still\r\nfelt an unaccountable bashfulness in her presence when referring to\r\nthe Stuart prince at all.\r\n\r\nSo he went to work in a circuitous way, for there was another matter\r\nthat troubled him, but less so than the expedition: therefore,\r\nperhaps, he spoke of it first.\r\n\r\n\"I presume, my dear child,\" he said lightly, \"that you are\r\nsufficiently a woman of the world to understand that some sort of\r\nreparation is due from your husband to Monsieur de Stainville.\"\r\n\r\n\"Reparation? . . .\" she asked. \"For what?\"\r\n\r\nAgain she stared at him blankly, and with that vague expression of\r\npuzzlement which irritated whilst it half-frightened him.\r\n\r\n\"You were there, my dear,\" he said impatiently, \"you know . . . and of\r\ncourse you must have seen . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Milor jeered at Gaston, then tripped him up with his foot, so that\r\nMonsieur de Stainville measured his full length on the floor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not notice. . . .\" she said simply.\r\n\r\n\"But many people did . . . enough at all events to give Monsieur de\r\nStainville the initiative in the necessary reparation. He was the\r\ninsulted party.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! a duel, you mean,\" she said indifferently, \"yes, I suppose my\r\nhusband will fight Monsieur de Stainville if His Majesty will grant\r\nthem leave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gaston will not appeal to His Majesty, and milor cannot very well\r\nrefuse to meet him. The King has oft declared his intention of\r\npermanently suppressing all duelling just as it has been done in\r\nEngland. Even to-night after the unfortunate fracas, when I had the\r\nhonour of paying my final respects, His Majesty said to me: 'If milor\r\nEglinton and Monsieur de Stainville fight and one of them is killed,\r\nwe'll hang the survivor!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Then they'll not fight, you think?\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur le Duc stared at his daughter. Such complete indifference as\r\nto her husband's actions in so grave a matter passed the bounds of\r\ncorrect behaviour.\r\n\r\n\"_Mais oui!_ they will fight, my dear!\" he said sternly. \"You know as\r\nwell as I do that Gaston could not pocket the slight put upon him by\r\nmilor without covering himself with ridicule. But the duel need not be\r\nserious . . . a scratch or two and no more. . . . Gaston is a perfect\r\nswordsman . . . he never misses his man,\" added the Duke hesitatingly.\r\n\"Is milor clever with the foils?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has never fought a duel to your knowledge?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think never.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whilst Gaston's skill is famous. . . . But, my dear, you need have no\r\nanxiety. . . . It was also with a view to reassuring you on the\r\nsubject that I have sought you so late. . . . You will believe your\r\nfather's word, Lydie, if he tells you that your husband is in no grave\r\ndanger at the hands of Gaston.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you, father dear,\" she rejoined with the same natural, even\r\ntone of voice which should have tranquillised him as to her mental\r\ncondition, but which somehow failed to do so.\r\n\r\n\"Gaston must take up the matter . . . you understand that. . . . It is\r\nquite public and . . . he would be laughed at if he appealed for leave\r\nto fight from His Majesty . . . the matter was not serious and the\r\nresult will be likewise. . . . Gaston will administer a slight\r\npunishment to milor . . . such a perfect swordsman, you understand,\r\ncan select the very place on his opponent's body where he will inflict\r\nthe scratch . . . it will be the shoulder perhaps . . . or . . . or\r\n. . . the cheek . . . nothing to be anxious about. . .\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not anxious, father dear,\" she said with a serene smile, amused\r\nin spite of herself at his many circumlocutions, his obvious\r\nconfusion, and his still quite apparent wish to speak of one more\r\nmatter which seemed to be weighing on his mind.\r\n\r\n\"Is that all that you wished to say to me, dear?\" she said gently,\r\n\"for if so I can assure you that you need not be troubled on my\r\naccount. I am neither anxious nor upset. . . . Milor I feel confident\r\nwill take tender care of his shoulder . . . or of his cheek just as he\r\ndoes of his comfort and of his . . . his dignity.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you will not take it amiss from me, my dear, if I do not offer to\r\nbe one of your husband's seconds in the affair?\" he asked suddenly,\r\nthrowing off his hesitation and speaking more frankly.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not, father dear. . . . I feel sure that milor himself\r\nwould not have suggested it. . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"My position near His Majesty . . . you understand, my dear,\" he\r\nexplained volubly, \"and also my . . . our association with Gaston.\r\n. . .\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly--certainly,\" she repeated, emphasizing her words, \"our\r\nassociation with Gaston. . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"And he really is acting like a perfect gentleman . . . a man of\r\nhonour. . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed?\"\r\n\r\n\"His enthusiasm, his courage, and devotion have been quite marvellous.\r\nAnd though we shall primarily owe the success of our enterprise to\r\nyou, my dear, yet His Majesty feels as I do, that we also owe much to\r\nMonsieur de Stainville. Ah! _mon Dieu!_ what it is to be young!\"\r\n\r\n\"What has Monsieur de Stainville done, dear, to arouse your special\r\nenthusiasm?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"You shall judge of it yourself, my dear. After the esclandre provoked\r\nby Irène to-night, the publicity given to our scheme, we held a\r\nhurried boudoir meeting, at which His Majesty and Madame de Pompadour\r\nwere present, as well as myself and Gaston. We all felt that you too\r\nshould have been there, dear, but you had gone with milor, and . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, never mind about me, father,\" she interrupted impatiently,\r\nseeing that he was getting lost in the mazes of his polite apologies.\r\n\"You held a boudoir meeting. What did you decide? . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"That after the publicity given to the main idea of our scheme, you\r\nunderstand,\" he rejoined, \"it would be no longer safe to wait for its\r\nexecution until _Le Levantin_ was ready for sea. Something had to be\r\nrisked, of course, but on the whole we all thought that now that the\r\nmatter had become 'le secret de Polichinelle' a six days' delay would\r\nbe dangerous, if not fatal to success. You were not there, Lydie,\" he\r\nrepeated diffidently, \"we could not consult you. . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no! Then what did you decide?\"\r\n\r\n\"That we must send _Le Monarque_ off at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Le Monarque_? . . . at once? . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! she is quite ready, so you told me this morning. And though we\r\nfeared that Captain Barre might be too firm an adherent of the Stuart\r\ncause to be altogether reliable, still--as we had your own letter--we\r\nfinally decided that we had better trust him now, rather than wait for\r\n_Le Levantin_. . . . I think we did right, do you not? . . . Lydie.\r\n. . . Lydie . . . child, what is it?\"\r\n\r\nThe desperately anxious query had its justification in Lydie's\r\nterrible pallor, the wild dilation of her pupils, the dark purple\r\nrings which circled her eyes.\r\n\r\nAs her father spoke she had risen from the divan, and now she seemed\r\nunable to stand; she was trembling from head to foot, her hands were\r\nheld out before her, as in a pathetic appeal for physical support. In\r\na moment his arm was round her, and with gentle force he drew her back\r\nto the couch, pressing her head against his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Lydie . . . Lydie, dear . . . I am sure you are ill.\"\r\n\r\nBut already she had recovered from this sudden attack of faintness and\r\ndizziness, of which, with characteristic impatience for all feminine\r\nweaknesses, she was now thoroughly ashamed. Her nervous system had\r\nreceived so many severe shocks in the course of this terrible and\r\nmemorable day, that it was small wonder that this last awful blow\r\nstruck her physically as well as mentally.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, dear father,\" she said as lightly as she could for she still\r\nfelt very faint and ill, \"I am quite well, I assure you . . . please\r\n. . . please . . .\" she urged earnestly, \"do not worry about me now,\r\nbut tell me quite clearly--and as briefly as you can--exactly what are\r\nyour plans at this moment . . . yours and Gaston's, with regard to the\r\nexpedition against the Stuart prince . . . you spoke of a duel just\r\nnow . . . and then of Monsieur de Stainville's enthusiasm and courage.\r\n. . . I . . . I am a little confused . . . and I would like to\r\nunderstand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you as briefly as I can, my dear,\" he rejoined, not\r\nfeeling altogether reassured, and regarding her with loving anxiety.\r\n\"We decided that, instead of waiting for _Le Levantin_ to be ready for\r\nsea, we would send _Le Monarque_, and instruct Captain Barre in\r\naccordance with the plan and the letter which you gave us, and the\r\nsecret orders framed by His Majesty and myself. _Le Monarque_ having\r\ngot the Stuart and his friends on board will make straight for the\r\nnorth-west coast of England, and land the Jacobites at the first\r\npossible port, where they can be handed over to the English\r\nauthorities. Once this was settled, Gaston immediately offered to\r\nstart for Le Havre at dawn with the secret orders. We are not really\r\nafraid of Captain Barre's possible disloyalty--and, of course, he is\r\ncompelled to obey orders or suffer for his insubordination, which he\r\nis not likely to contemplate. On the whole I think we may safely say\r\nthat we run far less risk by sending _Le Monarque_ than by waiting for\r\n_Le Levantin_: and Gaston has full powers to promise Captain Barre a\r\nheavy bribe in accordance with the speed which _Le Monarque_ will\r\nmake. After that His Majesty was pleased to dismiss Monsieur de\r\nStainville and myself, being most specially gratified with Gaston's\r\nenthusiastic offer to ride at breakneck speed to Le Havre, as soon as\r\nhe could get to horse. Outside the boudoir, Gaston explained to me,\r\nhowever, that he could not shirk the duel with Lord Eglinton: his\r\nseconds, Monsieur de Belle-Isle and Monsieur de Lugeac, already had\r\nhis instructions and would wait on milor to-night: to put it off now\r\nwould be to cover himself with ridicule and to risk social ostracism;\r\nthe affront put upon his wife could not be allowed to rest until after\r\nhis own return. But the duel could take place at dawn, and then he\r\ncould get to horse half an hour later. . . . So you see, my dear,\r\nthat the duel cannot--because of these weighty reasons--have any\r\nserious consequences. As for our expedition, methinks everything now\r\nis most satisfactorily arranged, as Gaston swears that he will reach\r\nLe Havre ere the shades of the evening fall upon the sea.\"\r\n\r\nLydie had listened quite quietly to this long explanation, taking in\r\nevery detail of the project, lest anything should escape her. Her\r\nfather could indeed be completely reassured. She was perfectly calm,\r\napparently cheerful, and when he had finished speaking she thanked him\r\nquite naturally and expressed approval of all that had been done.\r\n\r\n\"Everything is beautifully planned and arranged, my dear father,\" she\r\nsaid pleasantly, \"methinks I cannot do better than take a rest. I fear\r\nI have been overwrought all day and have caused you much anxiety. All\r\nis for the best now, is it not? . . . Shall we both go to bed?\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur le Duc sighed with satisfaction. He seemed to have found a\r\nlong-lost daughter. This was the one he knew, self-possessed,\r\nclear-headed, a comfort and a guide.\r\n\r\nHe drew her to him and kissed her tenderly, and if there was a\r\nsuggestion of shrinking, of withdrawal in the young body, he was\r\ncertainly too preoccupied to notice it. He bade her \"good-night,\" and\r\nthen with obvious relief and a light, elastic step, he finally went\r\nout of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nM. DE STAINVILLE'S SECONDS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Monsieur Achille, having escorted Madame la Marquise as far as\r\nher apartments, once more retraced his sedate footsteps toward those\r\noccupied by Lord Eglinton, he was much surprised to find the worthy\r\nBaptiste Durand in the octagonal room which gave immediately on\r\nmilor's study.\r\n\r\nThe wizened little man looked singularly upset; he had a couple of\r\nheavy books under his arm: and two large white quills, one behind each\r\near, gave him the look of a frightened stork.\r\n\r\nIt was long past the usual hour when M. Durand laden with his bulky\r\nbooks habitually entered the Marquis's private room and remained\r\ncloseted therein with milor until long past midnight. Every evening at\r\nthe self-same hour he came to the octagonal room, passed the time of\r\nday with Monsieur Achille and then went in, to milor: he always\r\ncarried a leather bag filled with papers neatly tied in bundles, and\r\nhe wore a somewhat anxious look when he entered and one of relief when\r\nhe finally departed. Monsieur Achille had often bent his broad and\r\nmajestic back, in order to bring his ear down to the level of the\r\nkeyhole of the door, through which Monsieur Durand invariably\r\ndisappeared at ten o'clock in the evening; but all the satisfaction\r\nwhich his curiosity obtained was the sound of two voices, one steady\r\nand low and the other somewhat shrill, without any individual or\r\ncomprehensible sentence detaching itself from the irritating babel.\r\n\r\nAnd when M. Durand came out of the room after midnight, he bade\r\nMonsieur Achille a curt good-night and invariably refused any\r\ninformation with regard to the work he did for milor at that late hour\r\nof the night.\r\n\r\nWhen closely pressed he would vaguely say: \"Accounts!\" which of course\r\nwas ridiculous. Monsieur Achille had never heard of a nobleman\r\ntroubling himself about accounts, at the time when most people of\r\nconsideration were either at _petits soupers_ or else comfortably in\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nAs time went on Monsieur Achille ceased to take any interest in these\r\nnightly proceedings; they were so monotonous and so regular, that they\r\nwere no longer exciting. But to-night everything seemed changed. M.\r\nDurand instead of marching straight through with his books into the\r\nstudy, stood in the middle of the room, a veritable picture of\r\nhelpless perturbation.\r\n\r\n\"Why, M. Durand,\" said Achille greatly astonished, \"what ails you? You\r\nlook as if you had seen a ghost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sh!---sh!---sh!\" whispered the timorous little man, indicating with a\r\njerk of his lean shoulder the distant door of the study, \"do you hear\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Achille bent his ear to listen. But strive how he might he\r\ncould hear nothing but the great bracket-clock on the wall ticking\r\nmonotonously. He shrugged his shoulders to indicate that the worthy\r\nBaptiste had been dreaming, but there was a certain look in the\r\nwizened face which caused him to tiptoe toward the study door and once\r\nmore to bring his ear down to the level of the keyhole.\r\n\r\nThen he shook his head, and tiptoed back to the centre of the room.\r\n\r\n\"I can hear nothing,\" he whispered. \"Are you sure he is in there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite, quite sure,\" replied Durand.\r\n\r\n\"Then why don't you go in as usual?\"\r\n\r\n\"I . . . I can't!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I . . . I don't know. . . . I seemed to hear such a funny sound as if\r\n. . .\" he paused a moment searching for the words that would best\r\nrender his impression of what he had heard. Finding none apparently,\r\nhe reiterated:\r\n\r\n\"It is a very funny sound.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps milor was asleep and snoring,\" suggested the practical\r\nAchille.\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" protested Durand very energetically.\r\n\r\n\"Or ill . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah yes! . . . perhaps . . .\" stammered the little man, \"perhaps milor\r\nis ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll to him at once.\"\r\n\r\nAnd before M. Durand could prevent him--which undoubtedly he would\r\nhave done--Achille had gone back to the study door and loudly knocked\r\nthereat.\r\n\r\nAt first there was no answer. M. Achille knocked again, and yet again,\r\nuntil a voice from within suddenly said:\r\n\r\n\"Who is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Achille, M. le Marquise!\" responded the worthy with alacrity.\r\n\r\n\"I want nothing,\" said the voice. \"Tell Durand that I shall not need\r\nhim to-night.\"\r\n\r\nM. Durand nearly dropped his heavy books on the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Not want me!\" he ejaculated; \"we shall get terribly in arrears!\"\r\n\r\n\"Will milor go to bed?\" again queried M. Achille.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" came somewhat impatiently from within. \"Do not wait up for me.\r\nIf I want you later I will ring.\"\r\n\r\nAchille looked at M. Durand and the worthy Baptiste returned the look\r\nof puzzlement and wonder. Both shrugged their shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing to be done, my good Baptiste,\" said Achille at last;\r\n\"you had best take your paraphernalia away and go to bed. I know that\r\ntone of voice, I have heard it once before when . . . but never mind\r\nthat,\" he added abruptly checking himself, as if he feared to commit\r\nan indiscretion, \"enough that I know if milor says, in that tone of\r\nvoice, that he does not want you and that you are to go away--well\r\nthen, my good Durand, he does not want you and you are to go away.\r\n. . . Do you see?\"\r\n\r\nAnd having delivered himself of this phrase of unanswerable logic he\r\npointed toward the door.\r\n\r\nM. Durand was about to take his friend's sound advice, when a loud\r\nring broke in upon the silence which had fallen over this portion of\r\nthe stately palace.\r\n\r\n\"A visitor at this late hour,\" mused Monsieur Achille. \"Ma foi!\r\nmethinks perhaps milor was expecting a fair and tardy visitor. . . .\r\neh, M. Durand? . . . and that perhaps this was the reason why you and\r\nI were to go away . . . eh? . . . and why you were not wanted\r\nto-night, . . . What?\"\r\n\r\nM. Durand was doubtful as to that, but there was no time to discuss\r\nthat little matter, for a second ring, louder and more peremptory than\r\nthe first, caused M. Achille to pull himself together, to flick at his\r\ncravat, and to readjust the set of his coat, whilst M. Durand loath to\r\nretire before he knew something of the tardy visitor, withdrew with\r\nbooks, bag and papers into a dark corner of the room.\r\n\r\nAlready the sound of approaching footsteps drew nearer; the visitor\r\nhad been admitted and was now being escorted through the reception\r\nrooms by the two footmen carrying torches. The next moment the doors\r\nleading to the official suite of apartments were thrown open, M.\r\nAchille put himself in position in the centre of the room, whilst a\r\nloud voice from the distant hall announced:\r\n\r\n\"M. le Marquis de Belle-Isle! M. le Comte de Lugeac!\"\r\n\r\nAchille's broad back was bent nearly double. The names were well known\r\nto him and represented, if not exactly the flower of aristocratic\r\nFrance, at least the invisible power which swayed her destinies. M. le\r\nMarquis de Belle-Isle was Madame de Pompadour's best friend, and M. de\r\nLugeac was her nephew.\r\n\r\n\"Your master . . . is he within?\"\r\n\r\nIt was M. de Belle-Isle who spoke; his voice was loud and peremptory,\r\nthe voice of a man who only recently had been in a position to\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\n\"Milor is . . . er . . . within, M. le Marquis,\" said Achille with\r\nslight hesitation. It is not often that he was taken aback when in the\r\nexercise of his duties, but the situation was undoubtedly delicate,\r\nand he had not yet made up his mind exactly how he ought to deal with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNeither of the two gentlemen, however, seemed to have any intention of\r\nleaving him much longer in doubt.\r\n\r\n\"Go and tell him at once,\" said M. de Lugeac, \"that Monsieur le\r\nMarquis de Belle-Isle and myself will have to trouble him for about\r\ntwo minutes.\"\r\n\r\nThen as Achille seemed to be hesitating--for he did not move with any\r\nalacrity and his well-kept hand stroked his smooth, heavy chin--M. de\r\nBelle-Isle added more loudly:\r\n\r\n\"Go knave! and at once. . . . Par le diable, man! . . . how dare you\r\nhesitate?\"\r\n\r\nIndeed Monsieur Achille dared do that no longer. M. le Marquis de\r\nBelle-Isle was not a gentleman to be trifled with so he shrugged his\r\nmajestic shoulders, and rubbed his hands together in token that the\r\naffair had passed out of their keeping, and that he no longer held\r\nhimself responsible for any unpleasant consequences which might accrue\r\nfrom such unparalleled intrusion.\r\n\r\nHe strode with becoming majesty to the study door, his broad, straight\r\nback emphasising the protest of his whole attitude. Once more he\r\nknocked, but more loudly, less diffidently than before.\r\n\r\nThe voice from within queried with marked impatience:\r\n\r\n\"What is it now?\"\r\n\r\n\"An urgent call, Monsieur le Marquis!\" replied Achille in a firm\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"I can see no one. I am busy,\" said the voice from within.\r\n\r\nM. de Belle-Isle felt that this little scene was not quite dignified;\r\nneither he nor M. de Lugeac was accustomed to stand behind a lacquey's\r\nback, parleying with a man through closed doors: therefore when\r\nMonsieur Achille turned to him now with a look which strove to\r\nindicate respectfully but firmly that the incident was closed, he\r\npushed him roughly aside and himself called loudly:\r\n\r\n\"Pardi, Marquis, methinks you are over-anxious to forbid your door\r\nto-night. I, André de Belle-Isle and my friend le Comte de Lugeac\r\ndesire a word with you. We represent M. le Comte de Stainville, and\r\nunless you are closeted with a lady, I summon you to open this door.\"\r\n\r\nThen as the door remained obstinately closed--too long at any rate for\r\nM. le Marquis's impatience--he boldly placed his hand on the knob and\r\nthrew it open. The heavy panels flew back, revealing Lord Eglinton\r\nsitting at his secrétaire writing. His head was resting on his hand,\r\nbut he turned to look at the two gentlemen, as they stood, momentarily\r\nsilent and subdued in the doorway itself. He rose to greet them, but\r\nstared at them somewhat astonished and not a little haughtily, and he\r\nmade no motion requesting them to enter.\r\n\r\n\"We crave your pardon, milor,\" began Monsieur de Belle-Isle, feeling,\r\nas he afterward explained, unaccountably bashful and crestfallen, \"we\r\nwould not have intruded, M. de Lugeac and I, only that there was a\r\nslight formality omitted this evening without which we cannot proceed\r\nand which we must pray you to fulfill.\"\r\n\r\n\"What formality, Monsieur?\" asked milor courteously. \"I am afraid I do\r\nnot understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"The whole incident occurred very rapidly, we must admit,\" continued\r\nM. de Belle-Isle still standing in the doorway, still unwilling\r\napparently to intrude any further on this man whom he had known for\r\nsome time, yet who seemed to have become an utter stranger to him now:\r\nhaughty, grave and courteous, with an extraordinary look of aloofness\r\nin the face which repelled the very suggestion of familiarity. \"And\r\nthat is no doubt the reason, milor, why you omitted to name your\r\nseconds to Monsieur de Stainville.\"\r\n\r\n\"My seconds?\" repeated milor. \"I am afraid you must think me very\r\nstupid . . . but I still do not understand . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely, milor . . .\" protested M. de Belle-Isle, a little taken\r\naback.\r\n\r\n\"Would you be so kind as to explain? . . . if it is necessary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Necessary? Pardi, I should not have thought that it had been\r\nnecessary. You, milor, in yourself also and through Madame la Marquise\r\nyour wife have insulted M. le Comte de Stainville and Madame la\r\nComtesse too. We represent M. le Comte de Stainville in this affair,\r\nwherein we presume that you are prepared to give him satisfaction. And\r\nwe have come to-night, milor, to ask you kindly to name your own\r\nrepresentatives so that we may arrange the details of this encounter\r\nin the manner pre-eminently satisfactory to M. le Comte de Stainville,\r\nsince he is the aggrieved party.\"\r\n\r\nGradually M. de Belle-Isle had raised his voice. His feeling of\r\nbashfulness had entirely left him and he felt not a little wrathful at\r\nthis strange _rôle_ which he was being made to play. It was quite\r\nunheard of that a gentleman who had so grossly insulted another, as\r\nLord Eglinton had insulted M. de Stainville, should require such\r\nlengthy explanations as to what the next course of events would\r\nnecessarily be.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore, milor,\" he continued with some acerbity as Lord Eglinton\r\nhad vouchsafed no reply to his tirade, \"we pray you to name your\r\nseconds to us, without delay, so that we may no longer intrude upon\r\nyour privacy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I need not do that, M. le Marquis,\" said milor quietly. \"I require no\r\nseconds.\"\r\n\r\n\"No seconds?\" gasped the two gentlemen with one breath.\r\n\r\n\"I am not going to fight M. de Stainville.\"\r\n\r\nIf Lord Eglinton had suddenly declared his intention of dethroning\r\nKing Louis and placing the crown of France on his own head, he could\r\nnot more have astonished his two interlocutors. Both M. de Belle-Isle\r\nand M. de Lugeac were in fact absolutely speechless: in all their vast\r\nexperience of Court life such a situation had never occurred before,\r\nand literally neither of them knew exactly how to deal with it. M. de\r\nLugeac, young and arrogant, was the first to recover his presence of\r\nmind. Like his successful relative Jeanne Poisson de Pompadour he had\r\nbeen born in the slums of Paris, his exalted fortune, following so\r\nquickly in the wake of the ex-victualler's wife, had given him an\r\nassurance and an amount of impudence which the older de Belle-Isle\r\nlacked, and which stood him in good stead in the present crisis.\r\n\r\n\"Are we to look on this as a formal refusal, milor?\" he now asked\r\nboldly.\r\n\r\n\"As you please.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will not give M. le Comte de Stainville the satisfaction usually\r\nagreed upon between men of honour?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not fight M. de Stainville,\" repeated milor quietly. \"I am\r\nbusy with other things.\"\r\n\r\n\"But milor,\" here interposed M. de Belle-Isle testily: \"you cannot\r\nhave reflected on the consequences of such an act, which I myself at\r\nthis moment would hardly dare to characterize.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will excuse me, gentlemen,\" said Lord Eglinton with seeming\r\nirrelevance, \"but is there any necessity for prolonging this\r\ninterview?\"\r\n\r\n\"None at all,\" sneered M. de Lugeac. \"It is not our business to\r\ncomment on milor's conduct . . . at present,\" he added with audacious\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nBut M. de Belle-Isle, who, in spite of his undignified adherence to\r\nthe Pompadour and her faction, was a sprig of the old noblesse of\r\nFrance, was loath to see the humiliation of a high-born\r\ngentleman--whatever his faults might be--before such an upstart as de\r\nLugeac. A kindly instinct, not altogether unexplainable, caused him to\r\nsay encouragingly:\r\n\r\n\"Let me assure you, milor--though perhaps in this I am overstepping my\r\nofficial powers--that M. le Comte de Stainville has no desire to deal\r\nharshly with you. The fact that he is the most noted swordsman in\r\nFrance may perhaps be influencing you at this moment, but will you\r\ntrust to my old experience when I assure you that M. le Comte's noted\r\nskill is your very best safeguard? He will be quite content to inflict\r\na slight punishment on you--being a past master with his sword he can\r\ndo that easily, without causing you graver injury. I am telling you\r\nthis in confidence of course, because I know that these are his\r\nintentions. Moreover he starts on an important journey to-morrow and\r\nwould propose a very brief encounter with you at dawn, in one of the\r\nspinneys of the Park. A mere scratch, I assure you, you need fear no\r\nmore. Less he could not in all honour concede.\"\r\n\r\nA whimsical smile played round the corners of milor's mouth, chasing\r\nmomentarily the graver expression of his face.\r\n\r\n\"Your assurance is more than kind, M. de Belle-Isle,\" he said with\r\nperfect courtesy, \"but I can only repeat what I said just now, that I\r\nwill not fight M. de Stainville.\"\r\n\r\n\"And instead of repeating what I said just now, milor . . .\" said de\r\nLugeac with a wicked leer.\r\n\r\n\"You will elect to hold your tongue,\" said M. de Belle-Isle\r\nauthoritatively, placing his hand on the younger man's wrist.\r\n\r\nDe Lugeac, who lived in perpetual fear of doing or saying something\r\nwhich would inevitably betray his plebeian origin, meekly obeyed M. de\r\nBelle-Isle's command. The latter, though very bewildered, would be\r\nsure to know the correct way in which gentlemen should behave under\r\nthese amazing circumstances.\r\n\r\nLord Eglinton standing beside his secrétaire, his face in shadow, was\r\nobviously waiting for these intruders to go. M. de Belle-Isle shrugged\r\nhis shoulders partly in puzzlement, partly in contempt; then he nodded\r\ncasually to milor, turned on his heel, and walked out of the doorway\r\ninto the octagonal room beyond, whilst M. de Lugeac imitated as best\r\nhe could the careless nod and the look of contempt of his older\r\nfriend. M. Achille stepping forward now closed the study doors behind\r\nthe two gentlemen, shutting out the picture of that grave, haughty man\r\nwho had just played the part of coward with such absolute perfection.\r\n\r\n\"Bah! these English!\" said young de Lugeac, as he made the gesture of\r\nspitting on the ground. \"I had not believed it, _par tous les\r\ndiables!_ had I not heard with mine own ears.\"\r\n\r\nBut de Belle-Isle gravely shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I fear me the young man is only putting off the evil day. His skin\r\nwill have to be tough indeed if he can put up with . . . well! with\r\nwhat he will get when this business becomes known.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it will become known,\" asserted de Lugeac spitefully. He had\r\nalways hated what he called the English faction. Madame Lydie always\r\nsnubbed him unmercifully, and milor had hitherto most conveniently\r\nignored his very existence. \"By G--d I hope that my glove will be the\r\nfirst to touch his cheek.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sh!--sh!--sh!\" admonished de Belle-Isle, nodding toward Achille who\r\nwas busy with the candelabrum.\r\n\r\n\"Nay! what do I care,\" retorted the other; \"had you not restrained me\r\nI'd have called him a dirty coward then and there.\"\r\n\r\n\"That had been most incorrect, my good Lugeac,\" rejoined de Belle-Isle\r\ndrily, and wilfully ignoring the language which, in moments of\r\npassion, so plainly betrayed the vulgar origin. \"The right to insult\r\nLord Eglinton belongs primarily to Gaston de Stainville, and afterward\r\nonly to his friends.\"\r\n\r\nAnd although M. le Marquis de Belle-Isle expressed himself in more\r\nelegant words than his plebeian friend, there was none the less spite\r\nand evil intent in the expression of his face as he spoke.\r\n\r\nThen giving a sign to Achille to precede them with the light, the two\r\nrepresentatives of M. le Comte de Stainville finally strode out of the\r\napartments of the ex-Comptroller General of Finance.\r\n\r\nM. Durand, with his bulky books and his papers under his arms,\r\nfollowed meekly, repeatedly shaking his head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTHE FINAL DISAPPOINTMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nLydie waited a few moments while her father's brisk steps died away\r\nalong the stone-flagged corridors. In the silence of the evening, the\r\nquietude which rested on this distant portion of the palace, she could\r\nhear his brief word of command to the valet who had been stationed in\r\nthe antechamber; then the Duke's quick, alert descent down the marble\r\nstaircase, and finally the call for his coach oft repeated, when he\r\nreached the terrace and began skirting the building on his way to the\r\nmain paved yard, where, no doubt, his horses were awaiting his return.\r\n\r\nWhen everything in and around the palace seemed quiet again, Lydie\r\nrang for her maid.\r\n\r\n\"A dark hood and cloak,\" she ordered as soon as the girl appeared, and\r\nspeaking very rapidly.\r\n\r\n\"Madame la Marquise goes out again?\" asked the maid a little\r\nanxiously, seeing that the hour was late and she herself very sleepy.\r\n\r\n\"Only within the palace,\" replied Lydie. \"Quick, girl! the cloak!\"\r\n\r\nWithin two or three minutes she was enveloped from head to foot in a\r\ncloak of dark woollen material, that effectually hid the beautiful\r\ngown beneath. Then she bade the girl wait for her in her boudoir, and,\r\nnot heeding the latter's anxious protestations, she walked quickly out\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\nThe corridors and reception halls were now quite deserted. Even from\r\nthe main building of the palace, where the King himself was wont to\r\nsup copiously and long, there no longer came the faintest echo of\r\nrevelry, of laughter or of music. The vast château built at the cost\r\nof a nation's heart's blood, kept up at the cost of her tears and her\r\nhumiliation, now lay wrapped in sleep.\r\n\r\nIn this remote West Wing the silence was almost oppressive. From her\r\nown apartments Lydie could reach those occupied by milor, without\r\ngoing through the ante-chamber and corridors, where a few\r\nnight-watchmen were always stationed. Thus she could pass unperceived;\r\na dark, ghost-like figure, silent and swift, gliding through an\r\nenchanted castle, inhabited mayhap only by a sleeping beauty and her\r\nCourt. From outside not a sound, save the occasional hoot of an owl or\r\nthe flap of a bat's wings against the projecting masonry.\r\n\r\nLydie drew her cloak closely round her figure; though the August night\r\nwas hot and heavy with the acrid scent of late summer flowers she felt\r\nan inward shivering, whilst her temples throbbed and her eyes seemed\r\nmade of glowing charcoal. A few more rooms to traverse, a few moments\r\nlonger wherein to keep her trembling knees from giving way beneath\r\nher, and she would be in milor's rooms.\r\n\r\nShe was a little astonished to find them just as deserted as the rest\r\nof the palace. The great audience chamber with its monumental bed, the\r\nantechamber wherein M. Durand's wizened figure always sat enthroned\r\nbehind the huge secrétaire, and the worthy Baptiste himself was wont\r\nto hold intrusive callers at bay, all these rooms were empty, silent\r\nand sombre.\r\n\r\nAt last she reached the octagonal room, out of which opened the study.\r\nHere, too, darkness reigned supreme save for a thin streak of light\r\nwhich gleamed, thin and weird, from beneath the study door. Darkness\r\nitself fought with absolute stillness. Lydie came forward, walking as\r\nif in her sleep.\r\n\r\nShe called to milor's valet: \"Achille!\" but only in a whisper, lest\r\nmilor from within should hear. Then as there was no sound, no\r\nmovement, she called once more:\r\n\r\n\"Achille! is milor still awake? Achille! are you here?\"\r\n\r\nShe had raised her voice a little, thinking the man might be asleep.\r\nBut no sound answered her, save from outside the cry of a bird\r\nfrightened by some midnight prowler.\r\n\r\nThen she walked up to the door. There behind it, in that inner sanctum\r\nhung with curtains of dull gold, the man still sat whom she had so\r\noften, so determinedly wronged, and who had wounded her to-night with\r\na cruelty and a surety of hand which had left her broken of spirit,\r\nbruised of heart, a suffering and passionate woman. She put her hand\r\non the knob of the door. Nothing stirred within; milor was writing\r\nmayhap! Perhaps he had dropped asleep! And Gaston preparing to ride to\r\nLe Havre in order to send the swiftest ship to do its deed of\r\ntreachery!\r\n\r\nNo! no! anything but that!\r\n\r\nAt this moment Lydie had nerved herself to endure every rebuff, to\r\nsuffer any humiliation, to throw herself at her husband's feet,\r\nembrace his knees if need be, beg, pray and entreat for money, for\r\nhelp, anything that might even now perhaps avert the terrible\r\ncatastrophe.\r\n\r\nBoldly now she knocked at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Milor! milor! open! . . . it is I! . . . ! Lydie. . . . !\"\r\n\r\nThen as there was no answer from within she knocked louder still.\r\n\r\n\"Milor! Milor! awake! Milor! in the name of Heaven I entreat you to\r\nlet me speak with you!\"\r\n\r\nAt first she had thought that he slept, then that obstinate resentment\r\ncaused him to deny her admittance. She tried to turn the knob of the\r\ndoor, but it did not yield.\r\n\r\n\"Milor! Milor!\" she cried again, and then again.\r\n\r\nNaught but silence was the reply.\r\n\r\nExcitement grew upon her now, a febrile nervousness which caused her\r\nto pull at the lock, to bruise her fingers against the gilt ornaments\r\nof the panel, whilst her voice, hoarse and broken with sobs, rent with\r\nits echoes the peace and solemnity of the night.\r\n\r\n\"Milor! Milor!\"\r\n\r\nShe had fallen on her knees, exhausted mentally and physically, the\r\nblood beating against her temples until the blackness around her\r\nseemed to have become a vivid red. In her ear was a sound like that of\r\na tempestuous sea breaking against gigantic rocks, with voices calling\r\nat intervals, voices of dying men, loudly accusing her of treachery.\r\nThe minutes were speeding by! Anon would come the dawn when Gaston\r\nwould to horse, bearing the hideous message which would mean her\r\nlifelong infamy and the death of those who trusted her.\r\n\r\n\"Milor! milor! awake!\" She now put her lips to the keyhole, breathing\r\nthe words through the tiny orifice, hoping that he would hear. \"Gaston\r\nwill start at dawn . . . They will send _Le Monarque_, and she is\r\nready to put to sea . . . Milor! your friend is in deadly\r\nperil. . . ! I entreat you to let me enter!\"\r\n\r\nShe beat her hands against the door, wounding her delicate flesh. She\r\nwas not conscious of what she was doing. A mystic veil divided her\r\nreasoning powers from that terrible mental picture which glowed before\r\nher through the blood-red darkness. The lonely shore, the angry sea,\r\nthe French ship _Le Monarque_ flying the pennant of traitors!\r\n\r\nThen suddenly an astonished and deeply horrified voice broke in upon\r\nher ears.\r\n\r\n\"Madame la Marquise, in the name of Heaven! Madame la Marquise!\"\r\n\r\nShe heard quick footsteps behind her, and left off hammering against\r\nthe door, left off screaming and moaning, but she had not the power to\r\nraise herself from her knees.\r\n\r\n\"Madame la Marquise,\" came in respectful, yet frightened accents,\r\n\"will Madame la Marquise deign to allow me to raise her--I fear Madame\r\nla Marquise is not well!\"\r\n\r\nShe recognized the voice of Achille, milor's valet, yet it never\r\nentered her mind to feel ashamed at being found by a lacquey, thus\r\nkneeling before her husband's door. The worthy Achille was very upset.\r\nEtiquette forbade him to touch Madame la Marquise, but could he leave\r\nher there? in that position? He advanced timidly. His behaviour was\r\nsuperlatively correct even in this terrible emergency, and there was\r\nnothing in his deferential attitude to indicate that he thought\r\nanything abnormal had occurred.\r\n\r\n\"I thought I heard Madame la Marquise calling,\" he said, \"and I\r\nthought perhaps Madame la Marquise would wish to speak with milor\r\n. . .\"\r\n\r\nBut at the word she quickly interrupted him; rising to her feet even\r\nas she spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Yes! yes . . . ! milor . . . I do wish to speak with him . . . open\r\nthe door, Achille . . . quick . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"The door is locked on the outside, Madame la Marquise, but I have the\r\nkey by me,\" said M. Achille gravely. \"I had fortunately recollected\r\nthat mayhap milor had forgotten to put out the lights, and would in\r\nany case have come to see that all was safe . . . if Madame la\r\nMarquise will deign to permit me . . .\"\r\n\r\nIt was a little difficult to reconcile utmost respect of movement and\r\ndemeanour with the endeavour to open the door against which Madame la\r\nMarquise was still standing. However, everything that was deferential\r\nand correct was possible to Monsieur Achille; he fitted the key in the\r\nlock and the next moment had thrown the door wide open, whilst he\r\nhimself stood immediately aside to enable Madame la Marquise to enter.\r\n\r\nFour candles were burning in one of the candelabra; milor had\r\nevidently forgotten to extinguish them. Everything else in the room\r\nwas perfectly tidy. On the secrétaire there were two or three heavy\r\nbooks similar to those Monsieur Durand usually carried about with him\r\nwhen he had to interview milor, also the inkpot and sand-well, with\r\ntwo or three quills methodically laid on a silver tray. One window\r\nmust have been open behind the drawn curtains, for the heavy damask\r\nhangings waved gently in the sudden current of air, caused by the\r\nopening of the door. The candles too, flickered weirdly in the\r\ndraught. In the centre of the room was the armchair on which Lydie had\r\nsat a while ago, the cushion of red embroidery which milor had put to\r\nher back, and below the little footstool covered in gold brocade on\r\nwhich her foot had rested . . . a while ago.\r\n\r\nAnd beside the secrétaire his own empty chair, and on the table the\r\nspot where his hand had rested, white and slightly tremulous, when she\r\nproffered her self-accusation.\r\n\r\n\"Milor?\" she murmured inquiringly, turning glowing eyes, dilated with\r\nthe intensity of disappointment and despair on the impassive face of\r\nAchille, \"milor . . . ? where is milor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Milor has been gone some little time, Madame la Marquise,\" replied\r\nAchille.\r\n\r\n\"Gone? Whither?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know, Madame la Marquise . . . Milor did not tell me . . .\r\nTwo gentlemen called to see him at about ten o'clock; as soon as they\r\nhad gone milor asked for his outdoor clothes and Hector booted and\r\nspurred him . . . whilst I dressed his hair and tied his cravat . . .\r\nMilor has been gone about half an hour, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough . . . that will do!\"\r\n\r\nThat is all that she contrived to say. This final disappointment had\r\nbeen beyond the endurance of her nerves. Physically now she completely\r\nbroke down, a mist gathered before her eyes, the candles seemed to\r\nflicker more and more weirdly until their lights assumed strange\r\nghoul-like shapes which drew nearer to her and nearer; faces in the\r\ngloom grinned at her and seemed to mock, the walls of the room closed\r\nin around her, her senses reeled, her very brain felt as if it\r\nthrobbed with pain, and without a cry or moan, only with one long sigh\r\nof infinite weariness, she sank lifeless to the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nTHE DAWN\r\n\r\n\r\nM. le Comte de Stainville only shrugged his shoulders when M. de\r\nBelle-Isle and young de Lugeac brought him milor's reply.\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" he said with a sneer, \"he'll have to fight me later on or I'll\r\nhound him out of France! Never fear, gentlemen, we'll have our meed of\r\nfun very soon.\"\r\n\r\nOn the whole Gaston was not sorry that this stupid so-called \"affair\r\nof honour\" would not force him to rise before dawn. He had no special\r\nill-will against _le petit Anglais_, for whom he had always tried to\r\ncultivate a modicum of contempt. He had not always succeeded in this\r\npraiseworthy endeavour, for milor as a rule chose to ignore M. de\r\nStainville, as far as, and often more than, courtesy permitted.\r\n\r\nThe two men had not often met since the memorable evening when milor\r\nsnatched the golden prize which Gaston had so clumsily cast aside.\r\nTheir tastes were very dissimilar, and so was their entourage. Milor\r\nwas officially considered to belong to the Queen's set, whilst Gaston\r\nclung to the more entertaining company of Madame de Pompadour and her\r\nfriends; nor had M. de Stainville had the bad grace to interfere with\r\nhis wife's obvious predeliction for Lord Eglinton's company.\r\n\r\nThe memorable day which was just drawing to its close had seen many\r\nchanges--changes that were almost upheavals of old traditions and of\r\nhabitual conditions of court life. Gaston had deceived and then\r\nhideously outraged the woman whom long ago he had already wronged. A\r\nyear ago she had humiliated him, had snatched from him the golden\r\nprize which his ambition had coveted, and which she made him\r\nunderstand that he could not obtain without her. To-day had been his\r\nhour; he had dragged her down to the very mire in which he himself had\r\ngrovelled, he had laid her pride to dust and shaken the pinnacle of\r\nvirtue and integrity on which she stood.\r\n\r\nThat she had partly revenged herself by a public affront against Irène\r\nmattered little to Gaston. He had long ago ceased to care for _la\r\nbelle brune de Bordeaux_, the beautiful girl who had enchained his\r\nearly affections and thereby become a bar to his boundless ambition.\r\nThe social ostracism--applicable only by a certain set of puritanical\r\ndévotes--and the disdain of Queen Marie Leszcynska which his wife\r\nmight have to endure would be more than compensated by the gratitude\r\nof Pompadour and of His Majesty himself, for the services rendered by\r\nGaston in the cause of the proffered English millions.\r\n\r\nBut for him the expedition against the Stuart prince could never have\r\nbeen undertaken; at any rate, it had been fraught with great\r\ndifficulties; delays and subsequent failure would probably have\r\nresulted. Gaston de Stainville felt sure that in the future he could\r\ntake care that the King should never forget his services.\r\n\r\nAfter his wife's indiscreet outburst he feared once more for the\r\nsuccess of the plan. Remembering Lydie's reliance on _Le Monarque_ and\r\nher commander, he declared himself prepared to start for Le Havre\r\nimmediately. He was quite ready to display that endurance and\r\nenthusiasm, in the breakneck ride across the fields of Normandy, which\r\nLydie had thought to find in him for the good of a noble cause.\r\n\r\nGaston de Stainville's pockets were always empty; the two millions\r\nwhich the King had promised him would be more than welcome. His\r\nMajesty had even offered to supplement these by an additional half\r\nmillion if _Le Monarque_ sailed out of Le Havre before sunset on the\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\nThe incident of the duel with milor would have delayed matters\r\nand--who knows--perhaps have made that pleasant half million somewhat\r\nproblematical. Therefore Gaston received the news of the refusal with\r\na sardonic grin, but not with real impatience.\r\n\r\nHe felt really no great ill-will toward Lord Eglinton; but for that\r\nincident when he was forcibly made to measure his length on the\r\nparquet floor, Gaston would have willingly extended a condescending\r\nhand to the man whose wife he had so infamously wronged.\r\n\r\nThe incident itself had angered him only to the extent of desiring to\r\ninflict a physical punishment on milor. Sure of his own wrist as the\r\nmost perfect swordsman in France, he had fondled the thought of\r\nslicing off a finger or two, mayhap a thumb, from the hand of _le\r\npetit Anglais_, or better still of gashing milor's face across nose\r\nand cheek so as to mar for ever those good looks which the ladies of\r\nVersailles had so openly admired.\r\n\r\nWell! all these pleasant little occurrences could happen yet. M. de\r\nStainville was quite sure that on his return from Le Havre he could\r\nprovoke the Englishman to fight. Milor might be something of a\r\ncoward--obviously he was one, else he had accepted so mild a\r\nchallenge--but he could not always refuse to fight in the face of\r\ncertain provocation, which would mean complete social ruin if\r\ndisregarded.\r\n\r\nThe hour was late by the time Gaston de Stainville had bade good-night\r\nto Belle-Isle and Lugeac. Together the three men had drunk copiously,\r\nhad laughed much and sneered continually at the pusillanimous\r\nEnglishman.\r\n\r\n\"This comes of allowing all these aliens to settle amongst us,\" said\r\nde Lugeac impudently; \"soon there will be neither honour nor chivalry\r\nleft in France.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon de Stainville and Belle-Isle, both of whom bore ancient,\r\naristocratic names, bethought themselves that it was time to break up\r\nthe little party and to turn their backs on this arrogant\r\ngutter-snipe.\r\n\r\nThe three men separated at midnight. De Lugeac had a room in the\r\npalace, and Stainville and Belle-Isle repaired to their respective\r\nlodgings in the little town itself.\r\n\r\nSoon after dawn Gaston de Stainville was on horseback. He started\r\nalone, for that extra half million was dangling before his eyes, and\r\nhe was afraid that companionship--even that of a servant--might cause\r\nunlooked-for delay. He had a hundred and eighty leagues by road and\r\nfield to cover, and soon the day would become very hot. He meant to\r\nreach Le Havre before five o'clock in the afternoon; within an hour\r\nafter that, he could have handed over his instructions to Captain\r\nBarre, and seen _Le Monarque_ unfurl her sails and glide gracefully\r\nout of the harbour: an argosy anon to be laden with golden freight.\r\n\r\nThe little town of Versailles had scarce opened its eyes to the new\r\nday when the clink of a horse's hoofs on her cobble stones roused her\r\nfrom her morning sleep.\r\n\r\nA few farmers, bringing in their produce from their gardens, gazed\r\nwith keen interest at the beautiful animal and her gallant rider. The\r\nhour was indeed early for such a fine gentleman to be about.\r\n\r\nSoon the rough paving of the town was left behind; the sun, who at\r\nfirst had hidden his newly-awakened glory behind a bank of clouds, now\r\nburnt his way through these heavy veils, and threw across the morning\r\nsky living flames of rose, of orange, and of vivid gold and tipped the\r\ntowers and spires of distant Paris with innumerable tongues of fire.\r\n\r\nFar away the clock of Notre Dame tolled the hour of five. Gaston\r\ncursed inwardly. It was later than he thought, later than he had\r\nintended to make a start. That business of the duel had kept him up\r\nlonger than usual and he had felt lazy and tired in the morning. Now\r\nhe would have to make top speed, and he did not feel as alert, nor so\r\nwell prepared for the fatigues of a long day's ride, as he would have\r\nbeen two years ago, before the enervating dissipations of court life\r\nat Versailles had undermined the activity of his youth.\r\n\r\nFortunately the ground was soft and dry, the air keen and pure, and\r\nGaston spurred his horse to a canter across the fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE RIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is one hundred and fifty leagues from Versailles to the harbour of\r\nLe Havre as the crow flies, one hundred and eighty most like by road\r\nand across fields.\r\n\r\nGaston had twelve hours in which to cover the ground, a good horse,\r\nand the enthusiasm born of empty pockets when two and a half million\r\nlivres loom temptingly at the end of the journey.\r\n\r\nThe fields, after the corn harvest, were excellent for a gallop,\r\nyielding just sufficiently to the mare's hoofs to give her a pleasant\r\nfoothold, but not in any way spongy, with good stubble to give\r\nresistance and the sandy soil below to prevent the slightest jar.\r\nRiding under such conditions, in the cool hours of the morning, was\r\ndistinctly pleasant.\r\n\r\nGaston reached Nantes soon after seven, having covered close on forty\r\nleagues of his journey without unduly tiring Belle Amie. He was a good\r\nrider and knew how to ease her, and there was Arab blood in her. She\r\nmade light of the work, and enjoyed her gallops, being of the breed\r\nthat never shows fatigue, own daughter to Jedran who had carried\r\nMaurice de Saxe on his famous ride from Paris to Saargemund, three\r\nhundred leagues in eighteen hours.\r\n\r\nAt Nantes, Stainville partook of a frugal breakfast, and Belle Amie\r\nhad a rest and a mouthful of corn. He was again to horse within half\r\nan hour, crossing the Seine here by the newly constructed stone\r\nbridge, thence on toward Elboeuf. By ten o'clock the sun was high in\r\nthe heavens and was pouring heat like molten lead down on horse and\r\nrider. Progress had become much slower. Several halts had to be made\r\nat tiny wayside inns for a cooling drink and a rub down for Belle\r\nAmie. The enjoyment had gone out of the ride. It was heavy, arduous\r\nwork, beside which despatch riding, with message of life and death,\r\nwas mere child's play.\r\n\r\nBut this was not a case of life and death, but of that which was far\r\ndearer to Gaston than life without it. Money! money at the end of it\r\nall! even if Belle Amie dropped on the roadside and he himself had to\r\ncover the rest of the distance on foot. An extra half million if _La\r\nMonarque_ set sail before sunset to-day.\r\n\r\nAt Rouen, horse and rider had to part company. Belle Amie, who had\r\ncovered close on a hundred leagues, and most of it in the full glare\r\nof the midday sun, wanted at least a couple of hours rest if she was\r\nto get to Le Havre at all, and this her rider was unwilling to give\r\nher. At the posting hostelry, which stands immediately at the rear of\r\nthe cathedral, Stainville bargained for a fresh horse, and left Belle\r\nAmie in charge of mine host to be tended and cared for against his\r\nreturn, probably on the morrow.\r\n\r\nHere, too, he partook of a light midday meal whilst the horse was\r\nbeing got ready for him. A good, solid Normandy mare this time, a\r\nperfect contrast to Belle Amie, short and thick in the legs, with a\r\nbroad crupper, and a sleepy look in her eye. But she was a comfortable\r\nmount as Gaston soon found out, with a smooth, even canter, and though\r\nher stride was short, she got over the ground quickly enough. It was\r\nstill very hot, but the roads beyond Rouen were sandy and light; the\r\nlanes were quite stoneless and shaded by tall trees; the Normandy mare\r\nsettled down along them to an easy amble. She had not the spirit of\r\nBelle Amie but she made up in stolidity what she had lacked in\r\nswiftness. Gaston's first impatience at the slowness of her gait soon\r\nyielded to content, for she needed no checking, and urging being\r\nuseless--since she could go no faster--the rider was soon able to let\r\nhis mind rest and even to sink into semi-somnolence, trusting himself\r\nto the horse entirely.\r\n\r\nAt half-past five the towers of Notre Dame du Havre were in sight; an\r\nhour later than Gaston had dared to hope, but still far from the hour\r\nof sunset, and if he could infuse a sufficiency of enthusiasm into the\r\ncommander of _Le Monarque_, the gallant ship could still negotiate the\r\nharbour before dusk, the tide being favourable, and be out in the open\r\nere the first stars appeared in the heavens.\r\n\r\nThe little seaport town, whose tortuous, unpaved, and narrow streets\r\nwere ankle deep in slimy mud in spite of the persistent heat and\r\ndryness of the day, appeared to Gaston like the golden city of his\r\ndreams. On his left the wide mouth of the Seine, with her lonely shore\r\nbeyond, was lost in the gathering mist, which rose rapidly now after\r\nthe intense heat of the day. On his right, a few isolated houses were\r\ndotted here and there, built of mud, thatched and plastered over, and\r\nwith diminutive windows not more than a few inches square, because of\r\nthe tax which was heavy; they testified to the squalor and misery of\r\ntheir inhabitants, a few families earning an uncertain livelihood with\r\ntheir nets. Soon along the length of the river, as it gradually\r\nwidened toward its mouth, a few isolated craft came to view; fishing\r\nboats these mostly, with here and there a graceful brigantine laden\r\nwith timber, and a few barges which did a precarious coasting-trade\r\nwith salted fish and the meagre farm produce of the environs.\r\n\r\nGaston de Stainville took no heed of these, though the scene--if\r\nsomewhat mournful and desolate--had a certain charm of rich colouring\r\nand hazy outline in the glow of the afternoon sun. The heat had\r\naltogether abated, and the damp which rose from the spongy soil,\r\npeculiar to the bed of the river, was already making itself felt.\r\nGaston shivered beneath the light cloth coat which he had donned in\r\nthe morning, in view of the fatigues of a hot summer's day. His eyes\r\npeered anxiously ahead and to the left of him. His mare, who had borne\r\nhim stolidly for over five hours, was quite ready to give way; there\r\nwas no Arab blood in her to cause her to go on until she dropped. She\r\nhad settled down to a very slow jog-trot, which was supremely\r\nuncomfortable to the rider, whose tired back could scarcely endure\r\nthis continuous jar. Fortunately the straggling, outlying portions of\r\nthe townlet were already far behind; the little mud houses appeared\r\nquite frequently now, and from them, wizened figures came out to the\r\ndoorway; women in ragged kirtles and children half-naked but for a\r\nmeagre shift, gazed, wide-eyed, at the mud-bespattered cavalier and\r\nhis obviously worn-out mount.\r\n\r\nFrom the fine old belfry the chime had long tolled the half hour.\r\nGaston vainly tried to spur the mare to a final effort. She had\r\nreached a stage of fatigue when blows would not have quickened her\r\nsteps, whilst her rider, roused from his own somnolent weariness, was\r\nsuddenly alert and eager. Goal was indeed in sight. The mud huts even\r\nhad been left behind, and one or two stone houses testified to the\r\nimportance of the town and the well-being of its inhabitants; the\r\nfirst inn--a miserable wooden construction quite uninviting even after\r\na day's ride--had already been passed. Ahead was the church of Notre\r\nDame, the fish market, and the residence of the governor; beyond were\r\nsome low wooden buildings, suggestive of barracks, whilst the Seine,\r\never widening until her further shore was finally lost in the mist,\r\nnow showed an ever-varying panorama of light and heavy craft upon her\r\nbreast; brigantines, and fishing boats, and the new-fashioned top-sail\r\nschooners, and far ahead, majestic and sedate, one or two\r\nthree-deckers of His Majesty's own navy.\r\n\r\nGaston strained his eyes, wondering which of these was _Le Monarque_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n\"LE MONARQUE\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA few minutes later he had reached the principal inn of the town,\r\n\"L'Auberge des Trois Matelots,\" immediately opposite the rough wooden\r\njetty, and from the bay window of which Gaston immediately thought\r\nthat a magnificent view must be obtainable of the stretch of the river\r\nand the English Channel far away.\r\n\r\nHe turned into the gate. The house itself was low, one-storied only,\r\nand built entirely of wood round a central court-yard, which was as\r\ndeep in slime as the rest of the town of Le Havre. Opposite Gaston as\r\nhe rode in, were some primitive stablings, and on his right some\r\nequally primitive open sheds; the remaining two sides apparently stood\r\nfor the main portion of the building, as several doors gave upon a\r\ncovered verandah, to which some four or five steps gave access.\r\n\r\nA weary-eyed ostler in a blue blouse and huge wooden sabots, from\r\nwhich bunches of straw protruded at the heel came leisurely forward\r\nwhen Gaston drew rein. He seemed to have emerged from nowhere in\r\nparticular, risen out of the mud mayhap, but he held the mare none too\r\nclumsily when M. le Comte dismounted.\r\n\r\nThe next moment a portly figure appeared in one of the doorways under\r\nthe verandah, clad precisely like the ostler, save for the gorgeous\r\nscarlet kerchief round the gargantuan neck, whilst another, equally\r\nbright in hue, peeped out of the pocket of the blouse.\r\n\r\nAbove the scarlet neckerchief a round face, red as a Normandy apple,\r\nwas turned meditatively on the mud-stained cavalier, whilst a pair of\r\nsmall, beady eyes blinked drowsily at the afternoon sun.\r\n\r\n\"See that the mare gets a good rub down at once, then a feed of corn\r\nwith a dash of eau-de-vie in it, a litter of straw, and a drink of\r\nwater; she is done to death,\" said Gaston, peremptorily to the\r\nsleepy-looking ostler. \"I'll be round in a quarter of an hour to see\r\nif she is comfortable, and give you a taste of my whip if she is not.\"\r\n\r\nThe ostler did not reply, neither did he touch his forelock in token\r\nof obedience. He smothered a yawn and with slow, dragging steps he led\r\nthe over-tired mare toward the rough stabling in the rear. Gaston then\r\nturned toward the verandah and to the few wooden steps which led up to\r\nthe doorway, wherein the apple-faced man still stood with his hands\r\nbehind him, drowsily blinking at the unexpected visitor.\r\n\r\n\"Are you the innkeeper?\" asked Gaston curtly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, M'sieu,\" replied the other with great deliberation.\r\n\r\n\"I shall want a good room for the night, and a well-cooked supper. See\r\nto it at once.\"\r\n\r\nMine host's placidity gave way somewhat at these peremptory orders,\r\nwhich were accompanied by a loud and significant tapping of a whip\r\nacross a riding boot. But the placidity did not yield to eagerness,\r\nonly to a certain effort at sulky protest, as Gaston, having mounted\r\nthe steps, now stood facing him in his own doorway.\r\n\r\n\"My house is full, M'sieu . . .\" he began.\r\n\r\n\"I am on the King's business,\" shouted Gaston now with angry\r\nimpatience, \"so none of this nonsense. Understand?\"\r\n\r\nEvidently mine host not only understood, but thought it best to obey\r\nwith as good grace as he could muster. He stepped aside still somewhat\r\ngrudgingly, and allowed Gaston de Stainville to enter: but he did not\r\ncondescend to bow nor did he bid M'sieu the visitor welcome in his\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nGaston however was not minded to notice the fat man's sulky temper.\r\nThe moodiness of provincial innkeepers had become proverbial in\r\nFrance; they seemed to look upon all guests, who brought money into\r\ntheir pockets, as arrogant intruders, and treated them accordingly.\r\n\r\n\"See to a decent supper at once,\" repeated de Stainville now with that\r\nperemptoriness which he knew would alone ensure civility, \"and send a\r\nwench into my room to see that it is properly aired, and that clean\r\nlinen is put upon the bed.\"\r\n\r\nThe warning was no doubt necessary, judging by the appearance of the\r\nroom in which Gaston now found himself. It was low and stuffy in the\r\nextreme. He was conscious of nothing else for the moment, as only two\r\ndiminutive windows, hermetically closed, admitted a tiny modicum of\r\nlight through four dirty and thick panes of rough glass. On the left\r\nthere was a door evidently leading to another and larger room from\r\nwhich--as this door was ajar--came the sound of voices and also\r\nsuffocating gusts of very pungent tobacco.\r\n\r\nObviously there was some light and air in that further room, whereas\r\nhere it seemed to Gaston as if only cave-dwellers and moles could live\r\nand breathe.\r\n\r\n\"You had best serve my supper in there,\" he said, pointing with his\r\nriding whip toward that half-open door, and without waiting for the\r\nprotests which mine host was obviously preparing himself to make, he\r\nstrode boldly toward it and pushed it fully open.\r\n\r\nThe place was certainly very different to the one which he had just\r\nquitted. The floor was strewn with clean white sand, and, though the\r\nair was thick with the fumes of that same pungent tobacco, which\r\nalready had offended Gaston's nostrils, it was not hopelessly\r\nunpleasant, as the deep and square oriel window at the extreme end of\r\nthis long, low room was wide open, freely admitting the sweet, salt\r\nbreeze which blew straight from the English Channel; affording too--as\r\nGaston had originally surmised--a magnificent view of a panorama which\r\nembraced the mouth of the Seine, the rough harbour and tiny jetty,\r\nwith the many small craft lying at anchor on the calm bosom of the\r\nriver, and the graceful schooners and majestic three-deckers further\r\naway, all lit by the slanting rays of the slowly-sinking sun.\r\n\r\nGaston, without hesitation, walked straight up to a bench and trestle\r\ntable, which to his pleasurable surprise he found was unoccupied.\r\nThese were just inside the bay of the window, and he deliberately\r\nplaced his hat, coat and whip upon the table in token that he took\r\npossession of it. Then he once more turned to mine host, who, much\r\ntorn between respect for a man who travelled on the King's business--a\r\nnobleman mayhap--and pride of peasant at contact with an unwelcome\r\nvisitor, had slowly followed Gaston, lolling with that peculiar gait\r\nwhich betrays the ex-sailor whilst firm if deferential protest was\r\nwrit all over his rubicund countenance.\r\n\r\nJean Marie Palisson was born at Le Havre; he had been _armateur_ ere\r\nthe welcome death of a relative put him in possession of the most\r\nfrequented inn in the town together with a very comfortable\r\ncompetence, and the best furnished cellars this side of Rouen. He\r\ngreatly resented the appearance of a stranger in the midst of his\r\nusual habitués, which distinguished circle embraced M. le Général\r\ncommanding the fortress, M. the Military Governor of the port, M. the\r\nCivil Governor of the town, MM. the commanders on His Majesty's ships,\r\nnot to speak of M. le Maire, and M. le Député of the Parliament of\r\nRouen, in fact all the notabilities and dignitaries of the town and\r\nthe harbour.\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen were wont to assemble in this the best room of \"Les\r\nTrois Matelots\" at five o'clock, \"l'heure de l'apéritif,\" when\r\neau-de-vie, punch or mulled wine were consumed, in order to coax\r\nrecalcitrant appetites to a pleasurable anticipation of supper. It was\r\nan understood thing, between the worthy Jean Marie Palisson and his\r\ndistinguished customers, that no strangers were to be admitted within\r\nthis inner sanctum, save by the vote of the majority, nor had it ever\r\noccurred before that any one had thus forced an entrance past that\r\nmagic door which mine host guarded with jealous care.\r\n\r\nNow when Gaston thus arrogantly took possession of the best table in\r\nthe best portion of the best room in \"Les Trois Matelots,\" Jean Marie\r\nwas so taken aback, and so awed by the masterfulness which could rise\r\nto such complete disregard of the etiquette pertaining to the social\r\ncircles of Le Havre, that he found himself unable to do aught but\r\nshrug his broad shoulders at intervals, and blink his beady eyes in\r\ntoken of helpless distress.\r\n\r\nAnd this in spite of the fact that several pairs of eyebrows were\r\nlifted in token of pained surprise.\r\n\r\nGaston was equally unconscious of the disapproval which his entry had\r\nevoked, as of Jean Marie's want of alacrity in his service. When he\r\nentered, he noted that the several occupants of the room were\r\ngentlemen like himself, and he always felt thoroughly at home and\r\nunabashed amongst his kind: as for the landlord of a tumbledown\r\nprovincial inn, Gaston thought him quite unworthy of close attention.\r\nHe sat himself down on the edge of the table, dangling one well-booted\r\nleg with easy nonchalance, and from this elevated position he surveyed\r\nleisurely and with no small amount of impertinence, the company there\r\nassembled. He had scarce time to note the scowling looks of haughty\r\ndisapproval which were levelled at him from every side, when the door\r\nwas vigorously pushed open and an aggressively cheerful young man,\r\nloud of voice, jocose of manner, boisterously entered the room.\r\n\r\n\"Par ma foi! my worthy Jean Marie,\" he said in stentorian tones, \"is\r\nthis the latest fashion in Le Havre? the host not at the door to\r\nreceive his guests? . . . Hé! . . .\" he added, suddenly realizing the\r\npresence of a stranger in the room, \"whom have we here?\"\r\n\r\nBut already, at the first words uttered by the newcomer, Gaston de\r\nStainville had jumped to his feet, and as soon as the young man ceased\r\ntalking, he went forward to greet him.\r\n\r\n\"None other than Gaston de Stainville, my good Mortémar, and pleased\r\nindeed to look into a friend's face.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gaston de Stainville!\" exclaimed the other gaily, \"_par tous les\r\ndiables!_ but this is a surprise! Who would have thought to see you\r\nin this damned and God-forsaken hole!\"\r\n\r\n\"The King's business, my good Mortémar,\" said Gaston, \"and if you'll\r\nforgive me I'll see to it at once and then we'll sup together, eh?\r\n. . . Palsambleu! and I who thought I'd die of ennui during this\r\nenforced halt on this lonely shore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ennui? perish the thought! Gentlemen,\" added the young Comte de\r\nMortémar, with a graceful flourish of the arm which embraced the\r\nentire company, \"allow me to present unto you the most accomplished\r\ncavalier of the day, whom I have the honour to call my friend, and\r\nwhom I hope we will all have the honour to call our guest to-night, M.\r\nle Comte Gaston Amédé de Stainville.\"\r\n\r\nGaston had no cause now to complain of want of welcome. Once the\r\nstranger duly accredited and presented by a member of the intimate\r\ncircle, he was cheered to the echo. Every one rose to greet him, many\r\npressed forward to shake him by the hand: the presence of a cavalier\r\nof Versailles with all the Court gossip, the little intrigues, the\r\nlaughable anecdotes which he would of necessity bring with him was\r\nindeed a veritable God-send to the little official world of Le Havre,\r\nwho spent most of its life in mortal ennui.\r\n\r\n\"As for thee, my good Jean Marie,\" now interposed Mortémar with mock\r\nseverity, \"let me tell thee at once that if within an hour this table\r\nhere doth not groan under the weight of the finest and best cooked\r\ncapon that Normandy can produce, neither I nor these gentlemen here\r\nwill e'er darken thy doors again. What say you, gentlemen?\"\r\n\r\nThere was loudly expressed assent, accompanied by much laughter and\r\nvigorous clinking of pewter mugs against the deal tables.\r\n\r\n\"And in the meanwhile,\" continued Mortémar, who seemed to have taken\r\nthe lead in this general desire to bid the visitor a substantial\r\nwelcome, \"a bowl of punch with half a glass of eau-de-vie and a dozen\r\nprunes soaked in kirsch therein. Never fear, friend Stainville,\" he\r\nadded, slapping Gaston boisterously on the shoulder, \"I tell you mine\r\nhost knows how to brew a bowl of punch, which will send you reeling\r\nunder one of his tables in less than half an hour.\"\r\n\r\nA round of applause greeted this cheerful sally.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, in that case,\" said Gaston, on whom the strenuous fatigues of\r\nthe day were telling severely after the preliminary excitement of\r\narrival, \"I'll to my business, ere your good cheer, friend, render me\r\nquite helpless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perish the thought of business,\" retorted Mortémar. \"Your head in a\r\nbucket of cold water after the punch, and you can meet the most astute\r\nnotary on even ground and beat him at his own game. The punch, knave!\"\r\nhe shouted to the fat landlord, \"the punch, this instant, M. le Comte\r\nde Stainville is wearied and is waiting for refreshment.\"\r\n\r\nBut Gaston's frame of mind was far too grave, his purpose far too\r\nimportant, to allow himself to be led into delaying business with\r\nCaptain Barre a moment longer than was necessary. Mortémar and his\r\nconvivial friends could not know that half a million livres would be\r\nthe price paid for that bowl of punch, since it might mean an hour's\r\ncarousing and the full of dusk before _Le Monarque_ received her\r\norders. He was deadly fatigued undoubtedly, faint too from the heat\r\nand want of proper food, but when money was at stake Gaston de\r\nStainville always displayed an enthusiasm and an amount of courageous\r\nendurance worthy of a better cause.\r\n\r\n\"A thousand thanks, my good Mortémar, and to you all, gentlemen,\" he\r\nnow said courteously but firmly, \"do not, I beseech you, think me\r\nchurlish if I must momentarily refuse your kind hospitality. One glass\r\nof eau-de-vie to give me a modicum of strength, and I must to my\r\nbusiness first. Gentlemen, I see by your coats that most of you serve\r\nthe King in some capacity or other, you know as well as I do that the\r\nlaws which govern the King's commands cannot be broken. I will not be\r\ngone long, half an hour at most; after that I am at your commands, and\r\nwill be the most grateful as well as the most joyous of you all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well spoken, friend Stainville,\" declared Mortémar \"and you, Jean\r\nMarie, serve a small refreshment to M. le Comte immediately. Nay,\r\nfriend,\" he added pleasantly, \"I fear I have been importunate . . .\r\n'twas the joy of seeing so elegant a cavalier grace this unhallowed\r\nspot.\"\r\n\r\nEvery one nodded approval; as Gaston had surmised, there were\r\nsoldiers, sailors there present, all of whom understood duty and\r\nobedience to the King's commands.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps some of us could be of assistance to M. le Comte de\r\nStainville,\" suggested a grave gentleman who wore His Majesty's\r\ncolours. \"If he is a stranger at Le Havre he might be glad of help.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed well said,\" spoke another; \"could one of us here accompany you\r\nanywhere, Monsieur le Comte?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am more than grateful, gentlemen,\" replied Gaston, to whom the host\r\nwas even now offering a cup of mulled wine. He drank the liquor at\r\none draught, then set down the cup ere he spoke further:\r\n\r\n\"And gladly will I accept these kindly offers of assistance,\" he now\r\nsaid. \"I am indeed a stranger here, and did feel doubtful how I could\r\nmost speedily accomplish my business. I must have speech with Captain\r\nBarre, gentlemen, commanding His Majesty's ship _Le Monarque_ and that\r\nwith as little delay as possible. . . .\"\r\n\r\nTo his intense astonishment he was interrupted by a ringing laugh from\r\nhis friend Mortémar.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, then my good Stainville,\" said the lively young man, \"you'll\r\nhave plenty of time for that bowl of punch, aye! and for getting right\r\nroyally drunk and fully sober again if your business is with Captain\r\nBarre.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" queried Gaston with a sudden frown.\r\n\r\n\"_Le Monarque_ sailed out of Le Havre an hour ago; methinks you can\r\nstill see her sails against the evening sun.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the young man pointed through the open window out toward the West.\r\nMechanically Gaston's eyes followed the direction in which his friend\r\npointed. There, far away in the mist-laden distance, a graceful\r\nthree-decker, with sails unfurled, was distinctly visible in the glow\r\nof the setting sun. She was gaily riding the waves, the soft\r\nsouth-easterly breeze having carried her swiftly and lightly already\r\nfar out to sea.\r\n\r\nGaston felt an awful dizziness in his head. An icy sweat broke out\r\nupon his brow, he passed a hand across his eyes for he did not feel\r\nthat he could trust them.\r\n\r\n\"That is not _Le Monarque_,\" he murmured.\r\n\r\n\"By my faith, but it is,\" said Mortémar, a little perturbed, for he\r\nhad not thought to be conveying evil news. \"I was bidding her captain\r\n'God-speed' myself little more than an hour ago. A gallant sailor, and\r\na personal friend,\" he added, \"and he seemed mighty glad to get on the\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whither was he bound?\" asked Gaston mechanically.\r\n\r\n\"Nay! that I do not know. Barre had received secret orders only an\r\nhour before he started. . . .\"\r\n\r\nBut now Gaston felt his senses reeling.\r\n\r\n\"She must be stopped! . . . she must be stopped!\" he shouted wildly.\r\n\"I have orders for her . . . she must be stopped, at any cost!\"\r\n\r\nAnd breaking through the compact group of his newly found friends he\r\nmade a wild dash for the door.\r\n\r\nBut the excitement, the terrible keenness of this disappointment had\r\nbeen too much for him, after the strenuous fatigues and the\r\noverpowering heat of the day. The dizziness turned to an intolerable\r\nfeeling of sickness, the walls of the room spun round and round him,\r\nhe felt as if a stunning blow had been dealt him on the head, and with\r\na final shriek of \"Stop her!\" he staggered and would have fallen\r\nheadlong, but that a pair of willing arms were there to break his\r\nfall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nTHE STRANGER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was M. des Coutures--a middle-aged man, military governor of Le\r\nHavre--who had caught Gaston de Stainville in his arms when the latter\r\nall but lost consciousness. A dozen willing pairs of hands were now\r\nready to administer to the guest's comforts, from the loosening of his\r\ncravat to the pulling off of his heavy riding boots.\r\n\r\n\"The mulled wine was too heavy for him,\" said M. le Maire Valledieu,\r\n\"no doubt he had been fasting some hours and his stomach refused to\r\ndeal with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell the kitchen wench to hurry with that supper, Jean Marie,\" said\r\nMortémar to mine host, \"he'll be himself again when he has eaten.\"\r\n\r\n\"If there's a plate of soup ready, bring that,\" added M. Valledieu.\r\n\"Anything's better than an empty paunch.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you, friends,\" now murmured Stainville feebly. \"I fear me I\r\nmust have turned giddy . . . the heat and . . .\"\r\n\r\nHe was recovering quickly enough. It had been mere dizziness caused by\r\nfatigue; and then that awful blow which had staggered him physically\r\nas well as mentally! His newly found friends had dragged him back to\r\nthe table close to the open window: the keen sea-breeze quickly\r\nrestored him to complete consciousness.\r\n\r\nAlready he had turned his head slowly round to watch that fast\r\ndisappearing three-decker, gleaming golden now in the distant haze.\r\n\r\nHis argosy which he had hoped to see returning from her voyage laden\r\nwith golden freight! Somehow as first the hulk and then the graceful\r\nsails were gradually merged into the Western glow, Gaston knew--by one\r\nof those inexplainable yet absolutely unerring instincts which baffle\r\nthe materialist--that all hopes of those coveted millions were\r\nvanishing as surely as did the ship now from before his gaze. He was\r\nstill weak in body as well as in mind, and it was as if in a dream,\r\nthat he listened to de Mortémar's carelessly given explanations of the\r\nevent which meant the wreckage of so many fondly cherished hopes.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Barre broke his fast in this very room this morning,\" said\r\nthe young man lightly, \"several of these gentlemen here, as well as\r\nmyself, had speech with him. He had no idea then that he would have to\r\nstart on a voyage quite so soon. He left here at eleven o'clock and\r\nwent back to his ship. An hour later when I was strolling along the\r\nshore I met him again. He seemed in a vast hurry and told me in a few\r\ncurt words that _Le Monarque_ had received orders to be under way as\r\nsoon as the tide permitted.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did not ask him whither the ship was bound?\" queried Gaston,\r\nspeaking hoarsely like a man who has been drinking.\r\n\r\n\"He could not tell me,\" replied the other, \"her orders were secret.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know who was the bearer of these secret orders?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I heard later that a stranger had ridden into Le Havre at\r\nmidday to-day. His mare--a beautiful creature so I understand--dropped\r\nnot far from here; she had been ridden to her death, poor thing; and\r\nher rider, so they say, was near to dropping too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw him,\" here interposed a young soldier, \"he was just outside\r\nthat God-forsaken hole, 'Le Gros Normand' and politely asked me if it\r\nwere the best inn in Le Havre.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you told him it was,\" said des Coutures with a growl, \"we want\r\nno stranger here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor do we want Le Havre to have a reputation for dirt and\r\ndiscomfort,\" corrected M. le Maire.\r\n\r\n\"And I certainly could not allow a gentlemen--for he was that--I'll\r\nlay any wager on it, with any one--to be made superlatively\r\nuncomfortable on the broken beds of 'Le Gros Normand,'\" asserted the\r\nyoung soldier hotly.\r\n\r\n\"You advised him to come here?\" gasped Mortémar with genuine horror.\r\nHe was the chief of that clique which desired to exclude, with utmost\r\nrigour from the sacred precincts of \"Les Trois Matelots,\" every\r\nstranger not properly accredited.\r\n\r\n\"Ma foi! what would you have me do?\" retorted the other sulkily.\r\n\r\n\"You did quite right, Lieutenant le Tellier,\" rejoined M. le Maire,\r\nwho was jealous of the reputation of Le Havre. \"Gentlemen must be\r\nunder no misapprehension with regard to the refinement and hospitality\r\nof this town.\"\r\n\r\nThe entrance of mine host carrying a steaming bowl of soup broke up\r\nthe conversation for awhile. Jean Marie was followed by a fat and\r\njovial-looking wench, who quickly spread a white cloth for Monsieur le\r\nComte's supper and generally administered to his wants.\r\n\r\nDe Mortémar, Général des Coutures, and M. le Maire Valledieu had\r\nconstituted themselves the nominal hosts of Gaston. They too sat round\r\nthe table, and anon when Jean Marie brought huge jugs of red wine,\r\nthey fell to and entertained their guest, plying him with meat and\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\nThis broke up the company somewhat. The other gentlemen had withdrawn\r\nwith all the respect which Frenchmen always feel for the solemnity of\r\na meal; they had once more assumed their old places at the various\r\ntables about the room. But no one thought yet of returning home:\r\n\"l'heure de l'apéritif\" was being indefinitely prolonged.\r\n\r\nConversation naturally drifted back again and again to _Le Monarque_\r\nand her secret orders. Every one scented mystery, for was it not\r\nstrange that a noble cavalier like Monsieur le Comte de Stainville\r\nshould have ridden all the way from Versailles on the King's business,\r\nin order to have speech with the commander of one of His Majesty's own\r\nships, only to find that he had been forestalled? The good ship had\r\napparently received orders which the King knew naught about, else His\r\nMajesty had not sent Monsieur de Stainville all this way on a fool's\r\nerrand.\r\n\r\nEager, prying eyes watched him as he began to eat and drink, dreamily\r\nat first, almost drowsily. Obviously he was absorbed in thought. He\r\ntoo must be racking his brains as to who the stranger might be who had\r\nso unexpectedly forestalled him.\r\n\r\nHis three genial hosts plied him continually with wine and soon the\r\ntraces of fatigue in him began to yield to his usual alertness and\r\nvigour. The well-cooked food, the rich liquors were putting life back\r\ninto his veins. And with renewed life came a seething, an ungovernable\r\nwrath.\r\n\r\nHe had lost a fortune, the gratitude of the King, the goodwill of\r\nPompadour, two and a half millions of money through the interference\r\nof a stranger!\r\n\r\nHe tried to think, to imagine, to argue with himself. Treacherous and\r\nfalse himself, he at once suspected treachery. He imagined that some\r\nsycophant, hanging to the Pompadour's skirts, had succeeded in winning\r\nher good graces sufficiently to be allowed to do this errand for her,\r\ninstead of himself.\r\n\r\nOr had the King played him false, and sent another messenger to do the\r\ndelicate business and to share in the spoils?\r\n\r\nOr had Lydie . . . ? But no! this was impossible! What could she have\r\ndone at a late hour of the night? How could she have found a messenger\r\nwhom she could trust? when earlier in the day she had herself admitted\r\nthat there was no one in whom she could confide, and thus turned\r\nalmost unwillingly to the friend of her childhood.\r\n\r\nJean Marie's favoured customers sat at the various tables sipping\r\ntheir eau-de-vie; some had produced dice and cards, whilst others were\r\ncontent to loll about, still hoping to hear piquant anecdotes of that\r\ndistant Court of Versailles, toward which they all sighed so\r\nlongingly.\r\n\r\nBut the elegant guest was proving a disappointment. Even after the\r\nsecond bumper of wine Gaston de Stainville's tongue had not loosened.\r\nHe was speculating on the identity of that mysterious stranger, and\r\nwould not allow his moodiness to yield to the joys of good cheer.\r\nTo-morrow he would have to ride back to Versailles hardly more\r\nleisurely than he had come, for he must find out the truth of how he\r\ncame to be forestalled. But he could not start before dawn, even\r\nthough fiery impatience and wrath burned in his veins.\r\n\r\nTo all inquisitive queries and pointed chaff he replied with a sulky\r\ngrowl, and very soon the delight of meeting an interesting stranger\r\ngave place to irritation at his sullen mood. He was drinking heavily,\r\nand did not seem cheerful in his cups, and anon even Mortémar's\r\nboisterous hilarity gave way before his persistent gloom.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour or two the company started yawning: every one had had\r\nenough of this silent and ill-tempered stranger, who not only had\r\nbrought no new life and animation into the sleepy town, but was ill\r\nrepaying the lavish hospitality of \"Les Trois Matelots\" by his\r\nreticence and sulky humour.\r\n\r\nOne by one now the habitués departed, nodding genially to mine host,\r\nas they settled for their _consommations_, and bidding as hearty a\r\ngood-night to the stranger as their disappointment would allow.\r\n\r\nDe Mortémar and Valledieu had tried to lure M. le Comte de Stainville\r\nto hazard or even to a more sober game of piquet, but the latter had\r\npersistently refused and sat with legs stretched out before him, hands\r\nburied in breeches' pockets, his head drooping on his chest, and a\r\nmeditative scowl between his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe wine had apparently quite dulled his brilliant wit, and now he\r\nonly replied in curt monosyllables to queries addressed directly to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAnon Valledieu and old Général de Coutures pleading the ties of family\r\nand home, begged to be excused. Now de Mortémar alone was left to\r\nentertain his surly guest, bored to distraction, and dislocating his\r\njaws in the vain efforts which he made to smother persistent yawns.\r\n\r\nIt was then close on half-past seven. The final glory of the setting\r\nsun had yielded to the magic wand of night which had changed the vivid\r\ncrimson and orange first to delicate greens and mauves and then to the\r\ndeep, the gorgeous blue of a summer's evening sky. The stars one by\r\none gleamed in the firmament, and soon the crescent moon, chaste and\r\ncold, added her incomparable glory to the beauty and the silent peace\r\nof the night.\r\n\r\nTiny lights appeared at masthead or prow of the many craft lying at\r\nanchor in the roadsteads, and from far away through the open window\r\nthere came wafted, on the sweet salt breeze, the melancholy sound of\r\nan old Normandy ditty sung by a pair of youthful throats.\r\n\r\nFatigue and gloom had oppressed Gaston at first, now it was\r\nunconquerable rage, seething and terrible, which caused him to remain\r\nsilent. De Mortémar was racking his brains for an excuse to break up\r\nthis wearisome _tête-à-tête_ without overstepping the bounds of\r\ngood-breeding, whilst cursing his own impetuosity which had prompted\r\nhim to take this surly guest under his wing.\r\n\r\nJean Marie now entered with the candles, causing a welcome diversion.\r\nHe placed one massive pewter candelabrum on the table occupied by\r\nGaston and de Mortémar: the other he carried to the further end of the\r\nroom. Having placed that down too, he lolled back toward de Mortémar.\r\nHis rubicund face looked troubled, great beads of perspiration stood\r\nout upon his forehead, and his fat fingers wandered along the velvety\r\nsurface of his round, closely-cropped crown.\r\n\r\n\"M'sieu le Comte . . .\" he began hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Mortémar smothering a yawn.\r\n\r\n\"A stranger, M'sieu le Comte . . .\" stammered Jean Marie.\r\n\r\n\"What, another? . . . I mean,\" added the young man with a nervous\r\nlittle laugh, feeling that the sudden exclamation of undisguised\r\nannoyance was not altogether courteous to his guest, \"I mean a . . .\r\nan . . . an . . . unknown stranger? . . . altogether different to M.\r\nle Comte de Stainville, of course!\"\r\n\r\n\"A stranger, M'sieu,\" repeated Jean Marie curtly. \"He came at midday.\r\n. . .\"\r\n\r\n\"And you told us nothing about him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not think it was necessary, nor that the stranger would trouble\r\nM'sieu le Comte. He asked for a clean room and a bed and said nothing\r\nabout supper at the time. . . . He seemed very tired and gave me a\r\ncouple of louis, just if as they were half livres.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt 'twas the stranger with whom Lieutenant Tellier had speech\r\noutside 'Le Gros Normand!'\" suggested de Mortémar.\r\n\r\n\"Mayhap! mayhap!\" rejoined Jean Marie thoughtfully. \"I took him up a\r\nbowl of sack and half a cold capon, but what he wanted most was a\r\nlarge wash-tub and plenty of water . . . it seems he needed a bath!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he was English,\" commented Mortémar decisively.\r\n\r\nBut at these words, Gaston, who had been listening with half an ear to\r\nmine host's explanations, roused himself from his heavy torpor.\r\n\r\nThe stranger who had forestalled him and sent _Le Monarque_ on her\r\nsecret voyage to-day was English!\r\n\r\nThen it was . . .\r\n\r\n\"Where is that stranger now?\" he demanded peremptorily.\r\n\r\n\"That's just it, M'sieu le Comte!\" replied Jean Marie, obstinately\r\nignoring Gaston and still addressing de Mortémar, \"he slept all the\r\nafternoon. Now he wants some supper. He throws louis about as if they\r\nwere dirt, and I can't serve him in there!\" he added with unanswerable\r\nlogic and pointing to the stuffy room in the rear.\r\n\r\n\"Pardi! . . .\" began Mortémar.\r\n\r\nBut Gaston de Stainville was fully alert now; with sudden vigour he\r\njumped to his feet and brought his fist crashing down on the table so\r\nthat the candelabrum, the mugs, and decanters of wine shook under the\r\nblow.\r\n\r\n\"I beseech you, friend, admit the stranger into this room without\r\ndelay,\" he said loudly. \"Ma foi! you have found me dull and listless,\r\nill-humoured in spite of your lavish hospitality; I swear to you by\r\nall the devils in hell that you'll not yawn once for the next\r\nhalf-hour, and that Gaston de Stainville and the mysterious stranger,\r\nwho thwarts his will and forestalls his orders, will afford you a\r\nmeasure of amusement such as you'll never forget.\"\r\n\r\nHis face was flushed, and his eyes, somewhat hazy from the copiousness\r\nof his libations, had an evil leer in them and an inward glow of\r\ndeadly hate. There was no longer any weakness, nor yet ill-humour,\r\nvisible in his attitude. His hands were clenched, one resting on the\r\ntable, the other roughly pushing back the chair on which he had been\r\nsitting.\r\n\r\n\"Admit the stranger, friend host!\" he shouted savagely. \"I'll vouch\r\nfor it that your patron will not regret his presence in this room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ma foi! I trust not,\" said a quiet voice, which seemed to come\r\nsuddenly from out the gloom. \"Gentlemen, your servant!\"\r\n\r\nMortémar turned toward the door, whence had proceeded that gentle,\r\ncourteous voice. Lord Eglinton was standing under the lintel,\r\nelegantly attired in full riding dress, with top boots and\r\nclosely-fitting coat. He wore no sword, and carried a heavy cloak on\r\nhis arm.\r\n\r\nHe made a comprehensive bow which included every one there present,\r\nthen he stepped forward into the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nREVENGE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must surmise that surprise and rage had rendered Gaston speechless\r\nfor the moment.\r\n\r\nOf all the conjectures which had racked his brains for the past two\r\nhours none had come near this amazing reality. Gaston was no fool, and\r\nin one vivid flash he saw before his mental vision not only his own\r\ndiscomfiture, the annihilation of all his hopes, but also the failure\r\nof King Louis' plans, the relegation of those fifteen millions back\r\ninto the pockets of His Grace the Duke of Cumberland.\r\n\r\nThat Eglinton had not ridden to Le Havre on the King's business but on\r\nhis own, that he had not sent _Le Monarque_ to Scotland in order that\r\nhe might share in those millions was of course obvious.\r\n\r\nNo! no! it was clear enough! Lydie having found that Gaston had failed\r\nher, had turned to her husband for help: and he, still nominally\r\nComptroller-General of Finance, had found it quite easy to send\r\nCaptain Barre on his way with secret orders to find Charles Edward\r\nStuart and ensure the safety of the Jacobites at once and at any cost.\r\n\r\nMilor was immensely rich; that had helped him too, of course; bribes,\r\npromises, presents of money were nothing to him. Mentally he was\r\nweak--reasoned Gaston's vanity--and Lydie had commanded him.\r\n\r\nBut physically he was as strong as a horse, impervious to fatigue, and\r\nwhilst Gaston rested last night preparing for his journey, _le petit\r\nAnglais_ was in the saddle at midnight and had killed a horse under\r\nhim ere de Stainville was midway.\r\n\r\nWhat King Louis' attitude would be over this disappointment it were\r\npremature to conjecture. Royal disfavour coupled with Pompadour's\r\nill-humour would make itself felt on innocent and guilty alike.\r\n\r\nThat he himself was a ruined man and that, through the interference of\r\nthat weak-kneed young fop, whom it had been the fashion in Versailles\r\nmildly to despise, was the one great, all-absorbing fact which seemed\r\nto turn Gaston's blood into living fire within his veins.\r\n\r\nAnd the man who had thus deliberately snatched a couple of millions or\r\nmore from his grip stood there, not twenty paces away, calm, somewhat\r\ngauche in manner, yet with that certain stiff dignity peculiar to\r\nEnglishmen of high rank, and withal apparently unconscious of the fact\r\nthat the rival whom he had deprived of a fortune was in this same room\r\nwith him, burning with rage and thirsting for revenge.\r\n\r\nGaston watched his enemy for awhile as he now settled himself at the\r\ntable, with Jean Marie ministering obsequiously to his wants. Soon\r\nmine host had arranged everything to his guest's liking, had placed a\r\ndish of stewed veal before him, a bottle of wine, some nice fresh\r\nbread, then retired walking backwards, so wonderfully deferential was\r\nhe to the man who dealt with gold as others would with tin.\r\n\r\nOne grim thought had now risen in Stainville's mind, the revival of a\r\nmemory, half-faded: an insult, a challenge, refused by that man, who\r\nhad thwarted him!\r\n\r\nA coward? Eh?\r\n\r\nThese English would not fight! 'twas well known; in battle, yes! but\r\nnot in single combat, not in a meeting 'twixt gentlemen, after a heady\r\nbottle of wine when tempers wax hot, and swords skip almost of\r\nthemselves out of the scabbard.\r\n\r\nAye! he would ride a hundred and eighty leagues, to frustrate a plan,\r\nor nathless to dip into the well-filled coffers of the Jacobite\r\nAlliance--such things were possible--but he would not fight!\r\n\r\nGaston hugged the thought! it was grim but delicious! revenge, bitter,\r\nawful, complete revenge was there, quite easy of accomplishment.\r\nFortune was lost to him, but not revenge! Not before his hand had\r\nstruck the cheek of his enemy.\r\n\r\nThis was his right. No one could blame him. Not even the King, sworn\r\nfoe of duelling though he might profess to be.\r\n\r\nA long laugh now broke from Gaston's burning throat! Was it not all\r\nridiculous, senseless, and puerile?\r\n\r\nHis Majesty the King, Pompadour, the Duc d'Aumont, Prime Minister of\r\nFrance, and he himself, Gaston de Stainville, the most ruthlessly\r\nambitious man in the kingdom, all fooled, stupidly fooled and tricked\r\nby that man, who was too great a coward to meet the rival whom he had\r\ninsulted.\r\n\r\nAt Gaston's laugh Eglinton turned to look in his direction, and his\r\neyes met those of de Mortémar fixed intently upon him.\r\n\r\n\"Surely it is M. le Contrôleur-Général,\" said the latter, jumping to\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\nHe had paid no heed to his guest's curious outburst of merriment,\r\nputting it down as another expression of his strange humour, else to\r\nthe potency of Jean Marie's wine; but he had been deeply interested in\r\nthe elegant figure of the stranger, that perfect type of a high-born\r\ngentleman which the young man was quick enough to recognise. The face,\r\nthe quaintly awkward manner, brought back certain recollections of two\r\ndays spent at the Court of Versailles.\r\n\r\nNow when Eglinton turned toward him, he at once recognised the\r\nhandsome face, and those kind eyes, which always looked grave and\r\nperfectly straight at an interlocutor.\r\n\r\n\"Milor Eglinton, a thousand pardons,\" he now said as he moved quickly\r\nacross the room. \"I had failed to recognise you at first, and had\r\nlittle thought of seeing so great a personage in this sleepy old\r\ntown.\"\r\n\r\nEglinton too had risen at his first words and had stepped forward,\r\nwith his habitual courtesy, to greet the young man. De Mortémar's hand\r\nwas cordially stretched out toward him, the next moment he would have\r\nclasped that of the young Englishman, when with one bound and a rush\r\nacross the room and with one wild shout of rage, Gaston de Stainville\r\novertook his friend and, catching hold of his arm, he drew him roughly\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\"Nay! de Mortémar, my friend,\" he cried loudly, \"be warned in time\r\nlest your honest hand come in contact with that of a coward.\"\r\n\r\nHis words echoed along the vast, empty room. Then there was dead\r\nsilence. Instinctively Mortémar had stepped back as if he had been\r\nstung. He did not of course understand the meaning of it all, and was\r\nso taken aback that he could no nothing but stare amazed at the figure\r\nof the young man before him. Eglinton's placidity had in no sense\r\ngiven way before the deadly insult; only his face had become pale as\r\ndeath, but the eyes still looked grave, earnest and straight at his\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n\"Aye! a coward,\" said Gaston, who during these few moments of silence\r\nhad fought the trembling of his limbs, the quiver of his voice. He saw\r\nthe calm of the other man and with a mighty effort smothered the\r\ncryings of his rage, leaving cool contempt free play. \"Or will you\r\ndeny here, before my friend le Comte de Mortémar, who was about to\r\ntouch your hand, that last night having insulted me you refused to\r\ngive me satisfaction? Coward! you have no right to touch another's\r\nhand . . . the hand of an honourable gentleman. . . . Coward! . . . Do\r\nyou hear me? I'll say it again--coward--and coward again ere I shout\r\nit on the house-tops of Versailles--coward!--even now when my hand has\r\nstruck your cheek--coward!\"\r\n\r\nHow it all happened Mortémar himself could not afterward have said,\r\nthe movement must have been extraordinarily quick, for even as the\r\nlast word \"Coward!\" rose to Gaston's lips it was drowned in an\r\ninvoluntary cry of agony, whilst his hand, raised ready to strike, was\r\nheld in a grip which indeed seemed like one of steel.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis done, man! 'tis done!\" said the gentle, perfectly even voice,\r\n\"but in the name of Heaven provoke me no further, or it will be murder\r\ninstead of fight. There!\" he added, releasing the other man's wrist,\r\nwho staggered back faint and giddy with the pain, \"'tis true that I\r\nrefused to meet you in combat yester e'en; the life of my friend,\r\nlonely and betrayed, out there in far-off Scotland, had been the price\r\nof delay if I did not ride out of Versailles before cock-crow, but\r\nnow 'tis another matter,\" he added lightly, \"and I am at your\r\nservice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye!\" sneered Gaston, still writhing with pain, \"at my service now,\r\nwhen you hope that my broken wrist will ensure your impunity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, sir, but at your service across the width of this table,\"\r\nresponded Eglinton coldly, \"a pair of pistols, one unloaded. . . . And\r\nwe'll both use the left hand.\"\r\n\r\nAn exclamation of protest broke from Mortémar's lips.\r\n\r\n\"Impossible! . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so, Monsieur le Comte?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Twere murder, milor!\"\r\n\r\n\"Does M. le Comte de Stainville protest?\" queried the other calmly.\r\n\r\n\"No! damn you! . . . Where are the pistols?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yours, M. le Comte, an you will; surely you have not ridden all the\r\nway from Versailles without a pair in your holster.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well guessed, milor,\" quoth Gaston lightly. \"Mortémar, I pray you, in\r\nthe pocket of my coat . . . a pair of pistols.\"\r\n\r\nMortémar tried again to protest.\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\" said Gaston savagely, \"do you not see that I must kill\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis obvious as the crescent moon yonder, M. de Mortémar,\" said\r\nEglinton with a whimsical smile. \"I entreat you, the pistols.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man obeyed in silence. He strode across the room to the\r\nplace lately vacated by Gaston, and near which his cloak was lying\r\nclose to his hat and whip. Mortémar groped in the pockets: he found\r\nthe two pistols and then rejoined the antagonists.\r\n\r\n\"I used one against a couple of footpads in the early dawn,\" said\r\nGaston, as he took the weapons from Mortémar's hands and placed them\r\non the table.\r\n\r\n\"'Twas lucky, Monsieur le Comte,\" rejoined Eglinton gravely, \"then all\r\nwe need do is to throw for the choice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dice,\" said Stainville curtly.\r\n\r\nOn a table close by there was a dice-box, left there by one of Jean\r\nMarie's customers: Mortémar, without a word, handed it to Eglinton. He\r\ncould not understand the placidity of the man: Gaston's attitude was\r\nsimple enough, primitive animal rage, blinding him to the possibility\r\nof immediate death; excitement too, giving him a sense of bravado, an\r\narrogant disregard of the consequences of his own provocation.\r\n\r\nEglinton was within his rights. He was now the insulted party, he\r\ncould make his own conditions, but did he wish to die? or was he so\r\nsupremely indifferent to life that he could view with perfect serenity\r\nthat pair of pistols, one of which death-dealing of a surety across a\r\nnarrow table, and that box of dice the arbiter of his fate?\r\n\r\nOf a truth Eglinton was perfectly indifferent as to the issue of the\r\ncombat. He did not care if he killed Gaston, nor did he care to live.\r\nLydie hated him, so what mattered if the sky was blue, or if the sun\r\nceased to shed radiance over the earth?\r\n\r\nIt was the supreme indifference of a man who with life had nothing\r\nelse to lose.\r\n\r\nHis hand was absolutely steady as he took the dice-box and threw:\r\n\r\n\"Blank!\" murmured Mortémar under his breath, as he saw the result of\r\nthe throw. Yet the face of milor was as impassive as before, even\r\nthough now by all the rules of chance Gaston's was the winning hand.\r\n\r\n\"Three!\" he said calmly, as the dice once more rolled on to the table.\r\n\"Monsieur le Comte, the choice of weapon rests with you.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more Mortémar tried to interpose. This was monstrous! horrible! a\r\nshocking, brutal murder!\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur de Stainville knows his own weapons,\" he said impulsively,\r\n\"he discharged one this morning and . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"Milor should have thought of this before!\" retorted Stainville\r\nsavagely.\r\n\r\n\"The remark did not come from me, Monsieur,\" rejoined Eglinton\r\npassively, \"an you will choose your weapon, I am fully satisfied.\"\r\n\r\nBut his grave eyes found occasion to send a kindly glance of gratitude\r\nto young de Mortémar. The latter felt a tightening of his very heart\r\nstrings: he would at this moment have willingly given his fortune to\r\navert the awful catastrophe.\r\n\r\n\"Mortémar, an you interfere,\" said Gaston, divining his thoughts,\r\n\"I'll brand you as a meddler before the Court of Versailles. An you\r\nare afraid to see bloodshed, get you gone in the name of hell.\"\r\n\r\nBy all the unwritten laws which governed such affairs of honour,\r\nMortémar could not interfere. He did not know the right or wrong of\r\nthe original enmity between these two men, but had already guessed\r\nthat mere disappointment with regard to the voyage of _Le Monarque_\r\nhad not been sufficient to kindle such deadly hate: vaguely he\r\nsurmised that somewhere in the background lurked the rustle of a silk\r\npetticoat.\r\n\r\nWithout the slightest hesitation now Gaston took one of the pistols in\r\nhis left hand: his right still caused him excruciating pain; and every\r\ntime he felt the agony, his eyes gleamed with more intense savagery,\r\nthe lust of a certain revenge.\r\n\r\nHe had worked himself up into a passion of hate. Money has the power\r\nto do that sometimes; that vanished hope of fortune had killed every\r\ninstinct in the man, save that of desire for vengeance. He was sure of\r\nhimself. The pistols were his as de Mortémar had said, and he had\r\nhandled them but a few hours ago: he could apprise their\r\nweight--loaded or unloaded--and he was quite satisfied.\r\n\r\nIt was hatred alone that prompted him to a final thrust, a blow, he\r\nthought, to a dying man. Eglinton was as good as dead, with the muzzle\r\nof a loaded pistol a foot away from his breast, and an empty weapon in\r\nhis own hand; but his serenity irritated Gaston; the blood which\r\ntingled in his own veins, which had rushed to his head almost\r\nobscuring his vision clamoured for a sight of a shrinking enemy, not\r\nof a wooden puppet, calm, impassive even before certain death.\r\n\r\nThe agony as he lifted the half-broken wrist to his coat was\r\nintolerable, but he almost welcomed it now, for it added a strange,\r\nlustful joy to the excitement of this deed. His eyes, glowing and\r\nrestless with fumes of wine and passion of hate, were fixed upon the\r\nmarble-like face of his enemy. Then from the breast-pocket of his\r\ncoat, he drew a packet of papers.\r\n\r\nAnd although he was nigh giddy with the pain in his wrist, he clutched\r\nthat packet tightly, toyed with it for a while, smoothed out the\r\ncreases with a hand which shook with the intensity of his excitement,\r\nthe intensity of his triumph.\r\n\r\nThe proofs in Madame la Marquise d'Eglinton's own writing that she was\r\nat one with the gang who meant to sell the Stuart prince for gold! The\r\nmap revealing his hiding-place! and her letter to him bidding him\r\ntrust the bearer whose orders--now affixed to map and letter--were\r\nthat he deliver the young Pretender into the hands of the English\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nThat these orders to _Le Monarque_ had been forestalled by milor\r\nEglinton could not exonerate Madame la Marquise from having been at\r\none with Gaston de Stainville and Madame de Pompadour, and others who\r\nmight remain nameless, in the blackest treachery ever planned against\r\na trusting friend.\r\n\r\nNo wonder Gaston de Stainville forgot physical suffering when he toyed\r\nlovingly with this packet of papers in his hand, the consummation of\r\nhis revenge.\r\n\r\nAt last 'twas done. A subtle, indefinable change had come over the\r\ncalm face of Lord Eglinton, an ashen grey hue which had chased the\r\nformer pallor of the cheeks, and the slender hand, which held the\r\npistol, trembled almost imperceptibly.\r\n\r\nSerenity had given way at sight of that packet of papers.\r\n\r\n\"Friend de Mortémar,\" said Gaston lightly, but with glowing eyes still\r\nfixed on his opponent, \"the chances of my demise being at least equal\r\nto those of milor's--seeing that I know not, on my honour, which is\r\nthe loaded pistol, and that methinks at this moment I can read murder\r\nin his eye--I pray you to take charge of this packet. It is a sacred\r\ntrust. In case of my death promise me that you will deliver it into\r\nthe hands of my wife, and into no other. Madame la Comtesse de\r\nStainville will know how to deal with it.\"\r\n\r\nThe young Comte de Mortémar took the packet from Gaston.\r\n\r\n\"I will do as you desire,\" he said coldly.\r\n\r\n\"You promise that no one shall touch these papers except my wife,\r\nIrène Comtesse de Stainville,\" reiterated Gaston solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"On my word of honour,\" rejoined the young man.\r\n\r\nThe request was perfectly proper and natural, very usual in such\r\ncases; de Mortémar could not help but comply. He could not know that\r\nthe fulfilment of this promise would mean public dishonour to an\r\ninnocent and noble woman, and the supreme revenge of a baffled\r\ntraitor.\r\n\r\nIf Gaston expected protest, rage, or excitement from his foe he was\r\ncertainly disappointed. Eglinton had all the characteristics of his\r\nrace, perfect sang-froid in the face of the inevitable, and an almost\r\nmorbid consciousness of pride and dignity. He could not filch those\r\npapers from Gaston nor prevent de Mortémar from accepting and\r\nfulfilling a trust, which had all the appearance of being sacred.\r\n\r\nHe knew that by this act he had wrested a fortune from a man whose\r\nfetish was money, and the power which money gives: true that being an\r\nhonest man himself, he had never thought of such an infamous revenge.\r\n\r\nIf he died now Heaven help his proud Lydie! but if he lived then\r\nHeaven help them both!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nTHE LETTER\r\n\r\n\r\nDe Mortémar had stowed the packet carefully away inside his coat,\r\nGaston keenly watching his antagonist the while.\r\n\r\n\"Are you ready, milor?\" he asked now with marked insolence of manner.\r\n\r\n\"At your service,\" replied the other quietly. \"M. de Mortémar, will\r\nyou give the word?\"\r\n\r\nThe two men stood opposite to one another, a table not four feet wide\r\nbetween them. Each held a pistol in his left hand. Of these one was\r\nloaded, the other not. De Mortémar had cleared the table, pushing\r\naside the decanter of wine, the tureen of soup, the glasses. The\r\nwindow was still open, and from that outside world which to these men\r\nhere present seemed so far away, there came the sound of the old\r\nchurch belfry tolling the hour of eight, and still from afar that\r\nmelancholy tune, the Norman ditty sung by young throats:\r\n\r\n    \"C'est les Normands, qu'à dit ma mère,\r\n    \"C'est les Normands qu'ont conquis l'Angleterre!\"\r\n\r\n\"Fire!\" said de Mortémar.\r\n\r\nTwo arms were raised. Eye was fixed to eye for one brief second, then\r\nlowered for the aim. There was a slight dull sound, then a terrible\r\ncurse muttered below the breath, as the pistol which Gaston de\r\nStainville had vainly tried to fire dropped from his hand.\r\n\r\nHad his excitement blinded him when he chose his weapon, or was it\r\njust fate, ruthless, inscrutable, that had placed the loaded pistol in\r\nLord Eglinton's hand?\r\n\r\n\"A blank!\" he shouted with a blasphemous oath. \"_À vous_, milor! Curse\r\nyou, why don't you fire?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fire, milor, in Heaven's name,\" said Mortémar, who was as pale as\r\ndeath. \"'Tis cruelty to prolong.\"\r\n\r\nBut Eglinton too had dropped his arm.\r\n\r\n\"M. le Comte de Stainville,\" he said calmly, \"before I use this weapon\r\nagainst you, as I would against a mad dog, I'll propose a bargain for\r\nyour acceptance.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd buy that packet of precious documents from me, eh?\" sneered\r\nGaston savagely, \"nay, milor, 'tis no use offering millions to a dying\r\nman. . . . Shoot, shoot, milor! the widowed Comtesse de Stainville\r\nwill deal with those documents and no one else. . . . They are not for\r\nsale, I tell you, not for all your millions now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not even for this pistol, M. le Comte?\"\r\n\r\nAnd calm, serene with that whimsical smile again playing round the\r\ncorners of his expressive mouth, Lord Eglinton offered the loaded\r\npistol to his enemy.\r\n\r\n\"My life? . . .\" stammered Gaston, \"you would? . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, mine, M. le Comte,\" rejoined milor. \"I'll not stir from this\r\nspot. I offer you this pistol and you shall use it at your pleasure,\r\nafter you have handed me that packet of letters.\"\r\n\r\nInstinctively Gaston had drawn back, lost in a maze of surprise.\r\n\r\n\"An you'll not take the weapon, M. le Comte,\" said Eglinton\r\ndecisively, \"I shoot.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment's silence, whilst Gaston's pride fought a grim\r\nbattle with that awful instinct of self-preservation, that strange\r\nlove of fleeting life to which poor mortals cling.\r\n\r\nMen were not cowards in those days; life was cheap and oft sold for\r\nthe gratification of petty vanity, yet who shall blame Gaston if, with\r\ncertain death before him, he chose to forego his revenge?\r\n\r\n\"Give me that pistol, milor,\" he said dully, \"de Mortémar, hand over\r\nthat packet to Lord Eglinton.\"\r\n\r\nHe took the pistol from milor, and it was his own hand that trembled.\r\n\r\nSilently de Mortémar obeyed. Milor took the packet of papers from him,\r\nthen held them one by one to the flame of the candle: first the map,\r\nthen the letter which bore Lydie's name writ so boldly across it. The\r\nblack ash curled and fell from his hand on to the table, he gripped\r\nthe paper until his seared fingers could hold it no longer.\r\n\r\nThen he once more stood up, turning straight toward Gaston.\r\n\r\n\"I am ready, M. le Comte,\" he said simply.\r\n\r\nGaston raised his left arm and fired. There was a wild, an agonized\r\nshriek which came from a woman's throat, coupled with one of horror\r\nfrom de Mortémar's lips, as _le petit Anglais_ stood for the space of\r\na few seconds, quite still, firm and upright, with scarce a change\r\nupon his calm face, then sank forward without a groan.\r\n\r\n\"Madame, you are hurt!\" shouted de Mortémar, who was almost dazed with\r\nsurprise at the sight of a woman at this awful and supreme moment. He\r\nhad just seen her, in the vivid flash when Gaston raised his arm and\r\nfired: she had rushed forward then, with the obvious intention of\r\nthrowing herself before the murderous weapon, and now was making\r\npathetic and vain efforts to raise her husband's inanimate body from\r\nthe table against which he had fallen.\r\n\r\n\"Coward! coward!\" she sobbed in anguish, \"you have stilled the bravest\r\nheart in France!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray God that I have not,\" murmured Gaston fervently, as, impelled by\r\nsome invisible force, he threw the pistol from him, then sank on his\r\nknees and buried his face in his hands.\r\n\r\nBut Mortémar had soon recovered his presence of mind, and had already\r\nreached his wounded friend, calling quickly to Jean Marie who\r\napparently had followed in the wake of Madame la Marquise in her wild\r\nrush from her coach to the inner room.\r\n\r\nTogether the two men succeeded in lifting Lord Eglinton and in gently\r\ninsinuating his body backward into a recumbent position. Thus\r\nLydie--still on her knees--received her lord in her arms. Her eyes\r\nwere fixed upon his pallid face with passionate intensity. It seemed\r\nas if she would wrest from those closed lids the secret of life or\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\"He'll not die? . . .\" she whispered wildly; \"tell me that he'll not\r\ndie!\"\r\n\r\nA deep red stain was visible on the left side, spreading on the fine\r\ncloth of the coat. With clumsy though willing fingers, Mortémar was\r\ndoing his best to get the waistcoat open, and to stop temporarily the\r\nrapid flow of blood with Lydie's scarf, which she had wrenched from\r\nher shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Quick, Jean Marie! the leech!\" he ordered, \"and have the rooms\r\nprepared . . .\"\r\n\r\nThen, as Jean Marie obeyed with unusual alacrity and anon his\r\nstentorian voice calling to ostler and maids echoed through the\r\nsilence of the house, Lydie's eyes met those of the young man.\r\n\r\n\"Madame! Madame! I beseech you,\" he said appalled at the terrible look\r\nof agony expressed on the beautiful, marble-like face, \"let me attend\r\nyou . . . I vow that you are hurt.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! no!\" she rejoined quickly, \"only my hand . . . I tried to clutch\r\nthe weapon . . . but 'twas too late . . .\"\r\n\r\nBut she yielded her hand to him. The shot had indeed pierced the\r\nfleshy portion between thumb and forefinger, leaving an ugly gash: the\r\nwound was bleeding profusely and already she felt giddy and sick. De\r\nMortémar bound up the little hand with his handkerchief as best he\r\ncould. She hardly heeded him, beyond that persistent appeal, terrible\r\nin its heartrending pathos:\r\n\r\n\"He'll not die . . . tell me that he'll not die.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst not five paces away, Gaston de Stainville still knelt, praying\r\nthat the ugly stain of murder should not for ever sully his hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE HOME IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first words which milor uttered when presently consciousness\r\nreturned were:\r\n\r\n\"The letter . . . Madonna . . . 'tis destroyed . . . I swear. . . .\"\r\n\r\nHe was then lying in Jean Marie's best bed, between lavender-scented\r\nsheets. On his right a tiny open window afforded a glimpse of sea and\r\nsky, and of many graceful craft gently lolling on the breast of the\r\nwaves, but on his left, when anon he turned his eyes that way, there\r\nwas a picture which of a truth was not of this earth, and vaguely,\r\nwith the childish and foolish fancy of a sick man who hath gazed on\r\nthe dark portals, he allowed himself to think that all the old tales\r\nof his babyhood, about the first glimpse of paradise after death, must\r\nindeed be true.\r\n\r\nHe was dead and this was paradise.\r\n\r\nWhat he saw was a woman's face, with grave anxious eyes fixed upon\r\nhim, and a woman's smile which revealed an infinity of love and\r\npromised an infinity of happiness.\r\n\r\n\"Madonna!\" he murmured feebly. Then he closed his eyes again, for he\r\nwas weak from loss of blood and from days and nights of fever and\r\ndelirium, and he was so afraid that the vision might vanish if he\r\ngazed at it too long.\r\n\r\nThe leech--a kindly man--visited him frequently. Apparently the wound\r\nwas destined to heal. Life was to begin anew, with its sorrows, its\r\ndisappointments, its humiliations, mayhap.\r\n\r\nYet a memory haunted him persistently--a vision, oh! 'twas a mere\r\nflash--of his madonna standing with her dear, white hand outstretched,\r\nbetwixt him and death.\r\n\r\nIt was a vision, of course; such as are vouchsafed to the dying: and\r\nthe other picture?--nay! that was a fevered dream; there had been no\r\ntender, grave eyes that watched him, no woman's smile to promise\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nOne day M. le Duc d'Aumont came to visit him. He had posted straight\r\nfrom Paris, and was singularly urbane and anxious when he pressed the\r\nsick man's hand.\r\n\r\n\"You must make a quick recovery, milor,\" he said cordially; \"_par\r\nDieu!_ you are the hero of the hour. Mortémar hath talked his fill.\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust not,\" rejoined Eglinton gravely.\r\n\r\nM. le Duc looked conscious and perturbed.\r\n\r\n\"Nay! he is a gallant youth,\" he said reassuringly, \"and knows exactly\r\nhow to hold his tongue, but Belle-Isle and de Lugeac had to be taught\r\na lesson . . . and 'twas well learned I'll warrant you. . . . As for\r\nGaston. . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! M. le Duc? what of M. le Comte de Stainville?\"\r\n\r\n\"He hath left the Court momentarily . . . somewhat in disgrace . . .\r\n'twas a monstrous encounter, milor,\" added the Duke gravely. \"Had\r\nGaston killed you it had been murder, for you never meant to shoot, so\r\nsays de Mortémar.\"\r\n\r\nThe sick man's head turned restlessly on the pillow.\r\n\r\n\"De Mortémar's tongue hath run away with him,\" he said impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"The account of the duel . . . nothing more, on my honour,\" rejoined\r\nthe Duke. \"No woman's name has been mentioned, but I fear me the Court\r\nand public have got wind of the story of a conspiracy against the\r\nStuart prince, and connect the duel with that event--hence your\r\npopularity, milor,\" continued the older man with a sigh, \"and Gaston's\r\ndisgrace.\"\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty's whipping-boy, eh? the scapegoat in the aborted\r\nconspiracy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor Gaston! You bear him much ill-will, milor, no doubt?\"\r\n\r\n\"I? None, on my honour.\"\r\n\r\nM. le Duc hesitated a while, a troubled look appeared on his handsome\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"Lydie,\" he said tentatively. \"Milor, she left Paris that night alone\r\n. . . and travelled night and day to reach Le Havre in time to help\r\nyou and to thwart Gaston . . . she had been foolish of course, but her\r\nmotives were pure . . . milor, she is my child and . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"She is my wife, M. le Duc,\" interrupted Lord Eglinton gravely; \"I\r\nneed no assurance of her purity even from her father.\"\r\n\r\nThere was such implicit trust, such complete faith expressed in those\r\nfew simple words, that instinctively M. le Duc d'Aumont felt ashamed\r\nthat he could ever have misunderstood his daughter. He was silent for\r\na moment or two, then he said more lightly:\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty is much angered of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Against me, I hope,\" rejoined Eglinton.\r\n\r\n\"Aye!\" sighed the Duke. \"King Louis is poorer by fifteen million\r\nlivres by your act, milor.\"\r\n\r\n\"And richer by the kingdom of honour. As for the millions, M. le Duc,\r\nI'll place them myself at His Majesty's service. My château and\r\ndependencies of Choisy are worth that,\" added milor lightly. \"As soon\r\nas this feeble hand can hold a pen, I'll hand them over to the crown\r\nof France as a free gift.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will do that, milor?\" gasped the Duke, who could scarce believe\r\nhis ears.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis my firm intention,\" rejoined the sick man with a smile.\r\n\r\nA great weight had been lifted from M. le Duc's mind. Royal\r\ndispleasure would indeed have descended impartially on all the friends\r\nof \"le petit Anglais\" and above all on milor's father-in-law, whose\r\nvery presence at Court would of a surety have become distasteful to\r\nthe disappointed monarch. Now this unparalleled generosity would more\r\nthan restore Louis' confidence in a Prime Minister whose chief virtue\r\nconsisted in possessing so wealthy and magnanimous a son-in-law.\r\n\r\nIndeed we know that M. le Duc d'Aumont continued for some time after\r\nthese memorable days to enjoy the confidence and gratitude of Louis\r\nthe Well-beloved and to bask in the sunshine of Madame de Pompadour's\r\nsmiles, whilst the gift of the château and dependencies of Choisy by\r\nMilor the Marquis of Eglinton to the crown of France was made the\r\nsubject of a public fête at Versailles and of an ode by M. Jolyot\r\nCrébillon of the Institut de France, writ especially for the occasion.\r\n\r\nBut after the visit of M. le Duc d'Aumont at his bedside in the\r\n\"auberge des Trois Matelots\" the munificent donor of fifteen millions\r\nlivres felt over-wearied of life.\r\n\r\nThe dream which had soothed his fevered sleep no longer haunted his\r\nwaking moments, and memory had much ado to feed love of life with the\r\nrememberance of one happy moment.\r\n\r\nMilor the Marquis of Eglinton closed his eyes, sighing for that dream.\r\nThe little room was so still, so peaceful, and from the tiny window a\r\ngentle breeze from across the English Channel fanned his aching brow,\r\nbringing back with its soothing murmur the memory of that stately home\r\nin England, for which his father had so often sighed.\r\n\r\nHow peaceful it must be there among the hills!\r\n\r\nThe breeze murmured more persistently, and anon with its dreamlike\r\nsound there mingled the frou-frou of a woman's skirts.\r\n\r\nThe sick man ventured to open his eyes.\r\n\r\nLydie, his wife, was kneeling beside his bed, her delicate hands\r\nclasped under her chin, her eyes large, glowing and ever grave fixed\r\nupon his face.\r\n\r\n\"Am I on earth?\" he murmured quaintly.\r\n\r\n\"Of a truth, milor,\" she replied, and her voice was like the most\r\nexquisite music he had ever heard; it was earnest and serious like her\r\nown self, but there was a tremor in it which rendered it unspeakably\r\nsoft.\r\n\r\n\"The leech saith there's no longer any danger for your life,\" she\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nHe was silent for awhile, as if he were meditating on a grave matter,\r\nthen he said quietly:\r\n\r\n\"Would you have me live, Lydie?\"\r\n\r\nAnd as she did not reply, he repeated his question again:\r\n\r\n\"Do you wish me to live, Lydie?\"\r\n\r\nShe fought with the tears, which against her will gathered in her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"Milor, milor, are you not cruel now?\" she whispered through those\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\"Cruel of a truth,\" he replied earnestly, \"since you would have saved\r\nme at peril of your own dear life. . . . Yet would I gladly die to see\r\nyou happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you not rather live, milor?\" she said with a smile of infinite\r\ntenderness, \"for then only could I taste happiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet if I lived, you would have to give up so much that you love.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is impossible, milor, for I only love one thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your work in France?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"No. My life with you.\"\r\n\r\nHer hands dropped on to the coverlet, and he grasped them in his own.\r\nHow oft had she drawn away at his touch. Now she yielded, drawing\r\nnearer to him, still on her knees.\r\n\r\n\"Would you come to England with me, Lydie? to my home in England,\r\namongst the hills of Sussex, far from Court life and from politics?\r\nWould you follow me thither?\"\r\n\r\n\"To the uttermost ends of the world, good milor,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note: Obvious punctuation errors, such as missing periods\r\nor unpaired quotation marks, have been corrected.
