It is in response to this request that\r\nthis volume is published.\r\n\r\nNewspaper publication is ephemeral. Newspaper files are short-lived.\r\nAnybody who has examined a newspaper of thirty years ago knows how\r\nflimsy it is, how it breaks and disintegrates to the touch. It lacks\r\nthe enduring quality of the newspaper of sixty or seventy-five years\r\nago when other elements entered into the composition of news-print\r\npaper. Newspaper publication is the thought of to-day; to-morrow, it\r\nis gone save for the impression left on the mind of the reader. That\r\nthe recollection of Colonel Roosevelt’s articles may have something to\r\nappeal to aside from crumbling newspaper files is the aim of this book.\r\nAnd so these expressions on the events in a crisis in our national\r\nhistory--from the mind of a man whose intense love of country was the\r\nadmiration of all who knew him, expressions which at the time of their\r\npublication stirred many to greater sacrifice for country, some to\r\nanger, even to rage--are here presented in enduring form.\r\n\r\nColonel Roosevelt’s contributions to The Star were his most frequent\r\nexpressions on the war; they were the outpouring of a great soul deeply\r\nstirred by the country’s situation. There were more than one hundred\r\narticles from his pen. They covered the vital time of our part in the\r\nwar from October, 1917, until his death January 6, 1919.\r\n\r\nThe reason he chose The Star as his medium of reaching the people,\r\nin a period when a large section of the American people sought and\r\nwas guided by what he said, was that Colonel Roosevelt and The Star\r\nhad known and understood each other for a long, long time. Their\r\nacquaintance dated back to the period of his service in the New York\r\nlegislature. The Star saw behind his conduct then the qualities and\r\nthe spirit which it was continually seeking to place at a premium in\r\noffices of public trust.\r\n\r\nLater, in 1889, when President Harrison appointed him a civil service\r\ncommissioner, The Star said:\r\n\r\n The appointment of Theodore Roosevelt as one of the civil service\r\n commissioners is a hopeful sign that President Harrison desires to\r\n give civil service reform a fair representation in the government. Mr.\r\n Roosevelt is an accomplished gentleman, with sincere aspirations for\r\n reformed methods of administration, as shown by his career in the New\r\n York legislature when Grover Cleveland was governor. Mr. Roosevelt is\r\n too independent ever to serve as a party henchman, and his voice and\r\n influence will always be in favor of what he believes to be the most\r\n efficient and business-like administration of affairs.\r\n\r\nColonel Roosevelt and the founder and editor of The Star, the late\r\nWilliam R. Nelson, had met, but they did not really know each other\r\nuntil after the war with Spain. In his canvass for the vice-presidency\r\nin 1900 Colonel Roosevelt was entertained at the Nelson home, Oak Hall,\r\nKansas City. From this visit dated better acquaintance. They had much\r\nin common and were alike in many characteristics: frank, outspoken,\r\nimpulsive, and passionately devoted to the same ideals of private life\r\nand public service.\r\n\r\nI recall a story of an impulsive act of Colonel Roosevelt back in his\r\nranchman days. A man of shady reputation had been appointed Indian\r\nAgent with the Sioux on a Dakota reservation. He put into effect many\r\nsharp practices with the Indians which would line his pockets with\r\nmoney. Roosevelt’s ranch was not far away and ranch affairs took him to\r\nthe agency. One day he went to the agency and sought the agent.\r\n\r\n“You are Mr. ----?” the ranchman asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“I have heard what you have been doing with the Indians. You are a\r\nthief! Good-day!”\r\n\r\nThe story, as told, was that the agent, aghast at the boldness of his\r\nvisitor, turned and walked away.\r\n\r\nThe late Curtis Guild, Jr., of Boston, and Senator Beveridge, of\r\nIndiana, were with Colonel Roosevelt on the Oak Hall visit. They found\r\ndelight in the paintings and books in Mr. Nelson’s home and Colonel\r\nRoosevelt gave proof of his wide range of knowledge by his instant\r\nrecognition of the work of painters of long-established reputation. In\r\nhis inspection of the library he asked to see what Mr. Nelson had on\r\nthe Greek dramatists. “I always ask for them in a man’s library,” he\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\nDuring this visit I was a listener at an argument between the two men\r\non partisanship. Mr. Nelson had in his early days affiliated with\r\nthe Democratic Party. In 1876 he was Mr. Tilden’s personal manager\r\nin Indiana. But with the party’s treatment of Tilden Mr. Nelson lost\r\npartisan zeal, and never after could he be considered a party man. He\r\nfounded The Star in 1880 as an independent newspaper; it has remained\r\nan independent newspaper.\r\n\r\nColonel Roosevelt’s argument was, that to accomplish anything in public\r\naffairs a man or a newspaper had to belong to a party organization. He\r\nprobably had in mind his experience in the Blaine campaign of 1884. His\r\nconclusion was that the American people were wedded to the two-party\r\nsystem and that one who aspired to do anything for the country could\r\nachieve only by working through a party organization.\r\n\r\nMr. Nelson granted what he said was true as to an individual, but\r\nnot as to a newspaper of the right sort. It was perhaps true as to\r\na newspaper which had as one of its aims the securing of political\r\nhonor for its owner, but the newspaper sincerely devoted to the public\r\ninterest could wield greater power by retaining its independence and\r\nin the end could accomplish more substantial achievements, a statement\r\nverified by his own conduct of The Star. Colonel Roosevelt saw the\r\nforce of Mr. Nelson’s contention, but stuck to his point that, with an\r\nindividual, accomplishment outside of party ranks was impossible.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to look back over the growth of the mutual\r\nunderstanding and the fondness of the two men for each other dating\r\nfrom that visit in 1900. After leaving Kansas City, Colonel Roosevelt\r\nsent back a letter expressing his delight at the day spent at Oak Hall,\r\nclosing with “How I do wish I could spend the week in your library\r\ninstead of upon this infernal campaigning trip!”\r\n\r\nWhen the assassin’s bullet struck down President McKinley, Mr. Nelson\r\nsent a telegram to Colonel Roosevelt expressing his horror at the deed\r\nand pledging the whole-hearted support of his newspaper in aiding him\r\nto carry the great burden which had been placed on his shoulders.\r\n\r\nMr. Nelson had no wish to be a distributor of federal patronage; he was\r\nconcerned in higher things. When Colonel Roosevelt turned to him for\r\nadvice on political matters, he was reluctant to give it, feeling his\r\nown lack of real knowledge of the politics of Kansas and Missouri and\r\nof the men who sought appointments. Late in 1901 Colonel Roosevelt,\r\nasking about conditions in Missouri, wrote, referring to St. Louis\r\nmen, “I think they have been rather after the offices and not after\r\nsuccess.... I should like to have some office-holder in Missouri to\r\nwhom I could tie.”\r\n\r\nMr. Nelson asked the political writers of The Star to write their\r\nestimate of the men seeking office and leadership, and these were\r\nsent to the President with his endorsement. The President repeatedly\r\nfollowed the ideas of these letters, and it is a pleasure to record\r\nthat in no instance was there subsequently cause for regret for any\r\nselection based on the letters.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 the President’s appointment of the Farm Life Commission\r\nreceived Mr. Nelson’s commendation, for he had long recognized the need\r\nof making farm life more attractive; indeed, he would have financed\r\nexperiments along this line had he been younger. At the same time\r\nMr. Nelson spoke approvingly of the President’s recent comment on\r\nthe courts, adding, “Courts need such criticism the worst kind. They\r\nsteadily undermine confidence in law and legal justice.”\r\n\r\n“I am sick at heart,” the President replied, “over the way in which\r\nthe courts have been prostituting justice in the last few years.\r\nThe greatest trouble will follow if they do not alter their present\r\nattitude. I suppose I shall ‘pay’ myself in some way for what I have\r\nsaid about the courts, but I have got to take the risk.”\r\n\r\nIn 1909, in the closing days of the Roosevelt Administration the\r\nPresident issued an executive order looking to a quick settlement of a\r\nlong-pending controversy over the channel of the Kaw River at Kansas\r\nCity. It was unexpected; indeed, few in Kansas City knew that the\r\nPresident was considering the subject. The order cut straight to the\r\nheart of the controversy in true Roosevelt fashion. The same day Mr.\r\nNelson sent this telegram to the President:\r\n\r\n It is quite worth while to have a real President of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe next day this reply came from the President:\r\n\r\n It is even better worth while to have a real editor of just the right\r\n kind of paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe Star supported Taft in the campaign of 1908 because it had faith\r\nthat he would carry out the Roosevelt policies. Events early in the\r\nTaft Administration weakened that faith; the Winona speech withered\r\nit. Mr. Nelson had had no correspondence with Colonel Roosevelt while\r\nhe was hunting in Africa. Two letters came from the ex-President,\r\none March 12, 1910, from the White Nile saying he expected to return\r\nin June; another from Porto Maurizio, a month later, saying, “I know\r\nyou will understand how delicate my position is,” and asking for an\r\nearly conference with Mr. Nelson on his return to this country. Mr.\r\nNelson’s final, open break with President Taft was “more in sorrow than\r\nin anger”; there was never bitterness of feeling, solely regret at a\r\nmistake in believing Mr. Taft stood for principles which events early\r\nin his administration showed convincingly he did not stand for.\r\n\r\nWriting to Colonel Roosevelt, in 1910, after his return from Africa,\r\nMr. Nelson referred to the Winona speech and the Ballinger case,\r\nconcluding: “I have wondered whether sooner or later there would not\r\nhave to be a new party of the Square Deal.”\r\n\r\nThe succeeding two years there were frequent conferences and\r\ninterchange of letters between Colonel Roosevelt and Mr. Nelson. The\r\nlatter had absolute confidence and abiding faith in Roosevelt. Late\r\nin 1910 the Colonel’s enemies were seeking to torment him from many\r\nangles. Mr. Nelson wrote him:\r\n\r\n It has occurred to me that the opposition will constantly be prodding\r\n you and lying about you with the evident purpose of getting you angry\r\n and so putting you to a disadvantage. That is the only hope on earth\r\n they have of stopping you.\r\n\r\n Your comment on Wm. Barnes was fine. It recalled to me an incident\r\n connected with Governor Tilden, who was the wisest politician I ever\r\n knew. As a young man I was his manager in Indiana. After the defeat of\r\n Lucius Robinson, whom he was backing for Governor of New York, I went\r\n East at his invitation to confer with him. He asked me to see Kelly,\r\n Clarkson, Potter, Dorsheimer, and Sam Cox, and some of the other men\r\n who had been fighting him, to get their views. “What shall I tell them\r\n about your position if they ask me?” I said. “Oh, tell them,” he said,\r\n “that I am very amiable.” In my adventures since that time I have\r\n often had occasion to remember that as sound advice. Amiability is a\r\n great weapon at times.\r\n\r\n But my point is that you never need to defend yourself at all. The\r\n people will take care of your defense. Besides, it is always a bad\r\n policy, in my opinion, to get to talking about the past. You are a\r\n Progressive. Your nose is to the front. The past doesn’t interest you.\r\n So I hope you will ignore the critics, no matter how exasperating they\r\n may be. And if you can’t ignore them, laugh at them!\r\n\r\nTo this the Colonel replied:\r\n\r\n I guess you are right; but it does make me flame with indignation when\r\n men who pretend to be especially the custodians of morals, and who sit\r\n in judgment from an Olympian height of virtue on the deeds of other\r\n men, themselves offend in a way that puts them on a level with the\r\n most corrupt scoundrel in a city government....\r\n\r\n But this does not alter the fact that, as you say, my business is to\r\n pay no heed to the slanders of the past, but to keep my face steadily\r\n turned toward the future. Here in New York the outlook is rather\r\n dark. There are a great multitude of men, some of them nominally\r\n respectable, but timid or misled, who do certainly, although rather\r\n feebly, object to the domination of Barnes and his fellow bosses; but\r\n who do sincerely, but rather feebly, prefer clean politics to corrupt\r\n politics; but who, nevertheless, dread any interference with what they\r\n regard as the rights of big business, any assault on what I regard as\r\n an improperly arranged tariff, any effort to work for the betterment\r\n of social conditions in the spirit of Abraham Lincoln; who regard all\r\n assaults and efforts of this nature as being worse than the rule of\r\n small bosses and the petty corruption of local politicians.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAs the presidential campaign of 1912 developed, there were frequent\r\nexchanges of views. In May Colonel Roosevelt wrote that he was\r\nconfident of victory in the Republican Convention in spite of all that\r\nwas being done against him by the men in control of the party. Only\r\nthose who were in the thick of the Republican Convention in Chicago\r\nin June realize how the fighting blood of the men on the progressive\r\nside, from the leader down, was aroused. Mr. Nelson was at Chicago\r\nduring the Republican Convention. Colonel Roosevelt sought his advice\r\nthroughout. The course which was ultimately followed had Mr. Nelson’s\r\nfull approval. In a telegram to Colonel Roosevelt after the break from\r\nthe Republican Party, Mr. Nelson said: “I am with you tooth and nail,\r\nto the limit and to the finish.”\r\n\r\nFollowing those vivid days and nights of the Republican Convention--a\r\nperiod no active participant can ever erase from his memory--came\r\nthe Orchestra Hall meeting, the first definite step to organize the\r\nProgressive Party, the National Progressive Party Convention in August,\r\nand then the memorable three-party campaign.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the campaign Mr. Nelson and the Colonel had the time\r\nand inclination to carry on a correspondence on things not directly\r\ntouching the issues on which the fight was made. In a letter from\r\nhis summer home at Magnolia, Massachusetts, Mr. Nelson dropped into\r\na discussion of what he called his two hobbies--to drive money out\r\nof the voting booth and out of the courthouse. His idea was that all\r\nlegitimate expenses of candidates for office should be paid by the\r\nState, and that there should be a reform of the voting system which\r\nwould avoid the necessity of party organization to get out the vote.\r\nHaving the vote taken by letter carriers was one way that appealed to\r\nhim. He would make justice free, “not for sale as it is to-day when\r\nthe rich man gets the best lawyers.” Lawyers should be officers of the\r\ncourt in fact as well as in theory, and should be compensated for their\r\nwork by the State, not by the litigants.\r\n\r\nReplying to this letter late in July, Colonel Roosevelt said:\r\n\r\n I am with you in principle on both the points you raise. I am with you\r\n on the question of the State paying the election expenses right\r\n away now. I have always stood for that course as the only one to give\r\n the poor man a fair chance in politics.\r\n\r\n Your other idea is new, but I have long been feeling my way to the\r\n same conclusion. A lawyer is not like a doctor. No real good for the\r\n community comes from the development of legalism, from the development\r\n of that kind of ability shown by the great corporation lawyers who\r\n lead our bar; whereas good does come from medical development. The\r\n high-priced lawyer means, when reduced to his simplest expression,\r\n that justice tends to go to the man with the longest purse. But the\r\n proposal is such a radical one that I do not know how it would be\r\n greeted, and it is something we will have to fight for later.\r\n\r\n  THEODORE ROOSEVELT\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Tʰᵉ Outlook\r\n  287 Fourth Avenue\r\n  New York\r\n\r\n  Office of\r\n  Theodore Roosevelt\r\n\r\n  May 24, 1912\r\n\r\n  My dear Colonel Nelson:\r\n\r\n  It certainly is fine, and it looks now as though we shall be able to\r\n  win in the Convention.\r\n\r\n  Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n  _Theodore Roosevelt\r\n  Good luck, oh staunchest of\r\n  friends!_\r\n\r\n  Colonel W. R. Nelson,\r\n  Kansas City, Mo.]\r\n\r\nLate in September, during a campaign tour of the West, Colonel\r\nRoosevelt spent a Sunday evening at Oak Hall. The subject of campaign\r\ncontributions came up, and the candidate became reminiscent,\r\nrecounting his first experience as governor of New York with campaign\r\ncontributions. It was an incident, he said, that might readily be\r\nmisconstrued and so he had not discussed it publicly.\r\n\r\nSoon after he was elected governor of New York, he had discovered that\r\nthe street railways were paying almost no taxes. Accordingly he took\r\nsteps to introduce a franchise tax bill into the legislature. Mr. Odell\r\nat once came to him and told him that he was following in the footsteps\r\nof Bryan and “Potato” Pingree, which was the most severe condemnation\r\nat that time. That warning having no effect, Mr. Platt came to him\r\nand said, “Governor, you can’t do this. Don’t you know that the\r\nWhitney-Ryan combination was one of the heaviest contributors to your\r\ncampaign fund?”\r\n\r\n“The deuce they were,” said Roosevelt; “I supposed they made their\r\ncontributions to Tammany.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” Platt returned, “they contributed to Tammany, but they\r\ngave us just half as much as they did Tammany. If they hadn’t expected\r\nfair treatment from us they would have given it all to Tammany.”\r\n\r\n“I told Platt they would get fair treatment from us,” Roosevelt said,\r\nin telling the story, “but if they expected immunity from taxation they\r\nwere going to be left.”\r\n\r\nAt that time the Whitney-Ryan combination owned the New York street\r\nrailways and so were going to be hard hit by the franchise tax. Mr.\r\nRoosevelt added that the franchise tax bill went through and created\r\nquite a scandal in high finance at that time. “Everybody was talking\r\nabout it,” he said, “and all the big financiers knew about it. So\r\nI never could have any sympathy with the view that Harriman or the\r\nStandard Oil people--if they really contributed to my campaign fund--or\r\nany other interest of that sort gave any money for campaign purposes\r\nunder a misapprehension. They knew from my deeds as well as my words\r\nthat they could not buy immunity from me, and that the best they could\r\nexpect was a square deal. I said one time to Bacon, ‘Bob, why is it\r\nthat Morgan and all his crowd are against me? Don’t they know that they\r\nwould get justice from me?’ Bacon smiled, hesitated, and then said,\r\n‘Yes, I suppose they do.’”\r\n\r\nIn the Progressive campaign Mr. Nelson violated a personal rule of\r\nmany years’ standing which forbade his personal participation in\r\npolitics. Into this campaign he went with his whole soul. Then past\r\nseventy years of age, he was abundantly able to direct but not to give\r\nof his physical strength. He assumed responsibility for organizing the\r\nparty in Missouri and lent his newspaper organization to that end.\r\nHe thought day and night for the party’s candidate and the party’s\r\nprinciples, and at the end of the campaign he had left undone nothing\r\nwhich he could have done for the candidate who had his absolute and\r\nunqualified confidence. After the election Colonel Roosevelt wrote Mr.\r\nNelson:\r\n\r\n I can never overstate how much I appreciate all that you have done and\r\n been throughout this fight. My dear Sir, I am very grateful and I know\r\n that the only way I can show my gratitude is so to bear myself that\r\n you will feel no cause for regret at having stood by me.\r\n\r\nAfter the campaign of 1912, which showed the remarkable strength of\r\nColonel Roosevelt with the people and demonstrated that he was still\r\na factor in American public life to be reckoned with, the tormenting\r\nby his political enemies continued. From many quarters darts had been\r\nhurled at “the old lion.” In July, 1914, after a libel suit for fifty\r\nthousand dollars had been started, Mr. Nelson telegraphed the Colonel\r\nat Oyster Bay:\r\n\r\n Too bad so much of the burden should fall on you. _Would gladly share\r\n it with you._\r\n\r\nIn a few days the message brought this letter:\r\n\r\n When a man is under constant fire and begins to feel, now and then,\r\n as if he did not have very many friends, and as if the forces against\r\n him were perfectly overwhelming, then, even though he is prepared to\r\n battle alone absolutely to the end, he is profoundly appreciative of\r\n the support of those whose support is best worth having. Your telegram\r\n not only gave me real comfort, but touched and moved me profoundly.\r\n\r\n  THEODORE ROOSEVELT\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was the end of the recorded correspondence between Colonel\r\nRoosevelt and Mr. Nelson. The former came West on a speaking tour in\r\nthe fall of 1914 and during his stay in Kansas City was a guest again\r\nat Oak Hall. Mr. Nelson accompanied him to a campaign meeting in a\r\nskating rink packed with people in Kansas City, Kansas, where he spoke\r\nin a sweltering atmosphere for more than an hour preaching with all his\r\nold vigor and enthusiasm the doctrines of the Progressive Party.\r\n\r\nThere was the same display from great crowds of people, along the\r\nstreets around the hall and everywhere he went, of the keen interest\r\nand personal admiration which Colonel Roosevelt’s presence in Kansas\r\nCity territory always brought out. Kansas City and its vicinity\r\nhad been Roosevelt ground since Kansas and Western Missouri became\r\nacquainted with him; indeed, any appearance by him was sufficient to\r\nfill Convention Hall in Kansas City to its capacity of fifteen thousand\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nFollowing Mr. Nelson’s death in April, 1915, there came from Colonel\r\nRoosevelt a sincere appreciation of his sorrow, ending, “We have lost\r\nliterally one of the foremost citizens of the United States, one of the\r\nmen whom our Republic could least afford to spare.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIn the 1916 campaign Colonel Roosevelt and The Star were of the same\r\nmind. Deeply attached to the principles on which the battle of 1912 had\r\nbeen conducted by the Progressive Party, they were conscious of the\r\nfutility of continuing the fight for those principles in a third party.\r\nThe American devotion to the two-party system had been convincingly\r\ndemonstrated again. The World War had been in progress two years, the\r\nLusitania had been sunk without stirring the Administration to more\r\nthan impotent words. Both thought that the Republican Party presented\r\nthe only hope of accomplishment. Colonel Roosevelt was The Star’s\r\nchoice for the nomination, but his nomination was too much to expect\r\nafter the break of 1912, and it gave its support to Mr. Hughes.\r\n\r\nEarly in June, 1917, Mr. Irwin Kirkwood, Mr. Nelson’s son-in-law, on\r\nhis way West from New York, chanced to meet Colonel Roosevelt on the\r\ntrain. A visit in the Colonel’s stateroom followed. The conversation\r\nturned to the seeming impossibility of a Roosevelt division for France,\r\na subject in which Mr. Kirkwood was personally interested, for he had\r\nbeen assured service in France if the Colonel’s ambition were realized.\r\nThe Colonel was discouraged over his failure to get active service\r\nand restless at the Administration’s slow preparation for war. Of the\r\nNation’s whole-hearted support of the war he was certain, and the high\r\nthought with him at the time was to bring influences to bear on the\r\nAdministration to speed up.\r\n\r\nAt this time Colonel Roosevelt was contributing a monthly article for\r\nThe Metropolitan Magazine written long in advance of its publication.\r\nDaily, momentous problems of the war were coming up. Mr. Kirkwood\r\nfelt strongly that the American people were eager to know what\r\nTheodore Roosevelt thought on these questions. If he could reach the\r\npublic quickly, great good would result to this country’s cause.\r\nRecalling that Mr. Nelson had said, when there was criticism of the\r\nex-President’s purpose to write for The Outlook, when it was first\r\nannounced, he would be mighty glad to have him write for The Star, Mr.\r\nKirkwood said:\r\n\r\n“Colonel Roosevelt, wouldn’t it be fine if you could get your ideas on\r\nthe war to the people before they were twenty-four hours old? The only\r\nway that could be done is through a newspaper.”\r\n\r\n“By George!” said the Colonel, with emphasis, “I never thought of that:\r\nit sounds like a good idea.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kirkwood said if he would consider the suggestion, The Star would\r\ncertainly welcome him.\r\n\r\n“Such a proposition would not tempt me from many newspapers,” Colonel\r\nRoosevelt continued. “In fact I know of no others except The Kansas\r\nCity Star and The Philadelphia North American from which I would\r\nconsider it. The Star particularly appeals to me as being printed\r\nin the heart of the great progressive Middle Western country, and\r\nbecause, too, of my love and affection for Colonel Nelson.”\r\n\r\nColonel Roosevelt remarked that he would like to discuss the proposal\r\nwith Mrs. Roosevelt and his daughter, Mrs. Nicholas Longworth, for he\r\nhad great confidence in the judgment of both. On Mr. Kirkwood’s return\r\nto New York a fortnight later, Colonel Roosevelt said he was still\r\n“filled up” with the idea and asked Mr. and Mrs. Kirkwood out to dinner\r\nat Oyster Bay with Mrs. Roosevelt and himself. Mrs. Kirkwood was unable\r\nto go. Mr. Kirkwood again discussed the proposal. Colonel Roosevelt’s\r\nposition was that if The Star was still unafraid, he was willing to\r\nstart. The next time the Colonel came to New York he had tea with Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Kirkwood, and there was a further full and frank discussion.\r\n\r\n“You, of course, know what you are doing,” Colonel Roosevelt said.\r\n“Many people do not like my ideas and probably many of your subscribers\r\nwill be perfectly furious at The Star for printing my editorials.”\r\n\r\nBoth Mr. and Mrs. Kirkwood assured him full consideration had been\r\ngiven to that phase, and while it was possible he and The Star\r\nmight not always agree, that fact would not stand in the way of the\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nSo the agreement was there entered into. Colonel Roosevelt suggested\r\nthat as 1920 was a presidential year the connection be for two years or\r\nuntil October, 1919, to which Mr. and Mrs. Kirkwood assented.\r\n\r\nColonel Roosevelt said he never pretended to be much of a business\r\nman, but a formal contract was the usual thing; he had one with The\r\nMetropolitan. Anyhow he would gladly sign it. He was asked if he\r\ndesired a contract and answered he did not.\r\n\r\n“You understand and we do--” said Mr. Kirkwood.\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for the sentence to be finished, Colonel Roosevelt\r\nsaid quickly, “That’s all I want to know. Let’s don’t bother with a\r\ncontract.”\r\n\r\nAnd on that basis the Colonel wrote for The Star until his death.\r\n\r\nEarly in September I was delegated to go to New York, as Managing\r\nEditor of The Star, to discuss with the Colonel the details of his work\r\nfor the paper. I met him at a hotel in Fifty-Seventh Street where he\r\nwent on the days he came in from Oyster Bay. Mrs. Roosevelt was with\r\nhim. Roosevelt was in high spirits, which was no uncommon thing. I\r\nrecall vividly my introduction to Mrs. Roosevelt.\r\n\r\n“Edith,” he said, leading me into the room where Mrs. Roosevelt was,\r\n“_here is my new boss_!”\r\n\r\nI didn’t say it, but the thought came to me that I would prefer the\r\ntask of “bossing” a tornado.\r\n\r\nThe talk that followed was that The Star had no desire to guide what\r\nhe wrote; that it desired him to write whatever was in him, and it\r\nwould print it. The Colonel said that was exactly what he wanted; he\r\ncould do nothing else. We discussed the distribution over the country\r\nof his writings, which he left entirely to The Star, with the request\r\nthat they be not offered to certain newspapers which had long shown a\r\nspirit of personal animosity to him and of habitual hostility toward\r\nhis principles, a suggestion which was wholly agreeable to The Star.\r\nHe asked about the length and frequency of the articles he was to\r\nwrite. It was agreed that an editorial of around five hundred words\r\nwas ideal, and at the start there would be two contributions a week.\r\nLater they were more frequent. The Colonel said he would probably find\r\nit difficult to keep down to five hundred words, but he recognized the\r\nlimitations of newspaper space and would do his best.\r\n\r\n“Now,” he said, “if I get too highbrow, don’t hesitate to tell me. I’m\r\nno tender flower; I can stand criticism.”\r\n\r\nHis secretary had come into the room to receive dictation from\r\naccumulated correspondence. I arose to go. “Stay with us,” the Colonel\r\nsaid, “until I finish this; you are a member of the family now.”\r\n\r\nShort, crisp sentences came from him as he dictated, each with the\r\nanimation of a face-to-face conversation with the writers of the\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that the Colonel was to take up his duties the first\r\nof October, and a few days after this meeting announcement was made\r\nthe country over that Theodore Roosevelt was to write for The Kansas\r\nCity Star. Immediately applications for the right to print the articles\r\npoured in from newspapers throughout the country.\r\n\r\nColonel Roosevelt came West in September on a speaking tour which\r\nincluded Kansas City. So he came into the office of The Star on the\r\nmorning of September 22, 1917, and went to a desk which had been\r\nassigned him, with the remark, “The cub reporter will now begin work.”\r\nHe was fond of that designation and often in conversation referred\r\nto himself as “The Star’s cub reporter.” With pencil he wrote out\r\non newspaper copy-paper, with much scratching and interlining, the\r\neditorial, “Blood, Iron, and Gold,” which appeared the following day.\r\nHis first editorial, however, was, a short time before, written on\r\nsuggestion of Mr. Kirkwood, a brief piece on the death of Dr. W. S.\r\nFitzsimons, of Kansas City, who was killed by a bomb in an airplane\r\nattack on a hospital in France--the first American officer to fall in\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nThe same day Colonel Roosevelt wrote another editorial for later\r\npublication. He was good nature itself that Saturday morning in the\r\noffice, joked and chatted with members of the staff, and seemed to be\r\nenjoying the novelty of his new connection.\r\n\r\nThe following Sunday there was a luncheon of The Star family at\r\nthe home of Mr. and Mrs. Kirkwood, at which the “new cub reporter”\r\nmade himself thoroughly at home. Editors, reporters, and men of the\r\nmechanical and circulation departments were there and had luncheon\r\nwith the Colonel. He mingled with all and took delight in chatting\r\nwith them of their work. During the afternoon he made an informal talk\r\nto “the family” out on the lawn, in which he commended the spirit of\r\nworking together shown in the expression “The Star family.” He spoke,\r\ntoo, of his long acquaintance with the aims and purposes of Mr. Nelson\r\nwhich were the aims and purposes of The Star, and said, as he had said\r\nbefore, that The Star was one of two daily newspapers with which he\r\nwould be proud of a connection.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement was that Colonel Roosevelt was to telegraph his\r\neditorials to The Star from Oyster Bay or wherever he was when he\r\nwrote them. They were put in type in The Star office and sent out from\r\nthere for simultaneous publication in a selected list of about fifty\r\nnewspapers. These included the best-known newspapers in the country\r\nand represented every section. The service was without charge beyond\r\ntelegraph tolls, it being The Star’s wish to give the widest diffusion\r\npossible to Colonel Roosevelt’s ideas on the conduct of the war through\r\nthe best channel in each city.\r\n\r\nFrequently there were suggestions from The Star to the Colonel. Always\r\nhe was gracious in his treatment of those suggestions, invariably\r\nwriting along the lines indicated and often amplifying and bettering\r\nthem. On the other hand--except in two instances--the Colonel’s\r\neditorials were printed just as they were written, and if any change\r\nin copy were considered advisable it was made only after he had been\r\nconsulted by wire and had approved it.\r\n\r\nFrom the start the country was much interested in the expressions from\r\nthe Colonel. The newspapers which received them printed them faithfully\r\nand conspicuously. However, the service had been in operation not more\r\nthan a fortnight before there came rumbles of disapproval and doubt,\r\nalmost altogether from newspapers published south of Mason and Dixon’s\r\nLine.\r\n\r\nOne of the early editorials, entitled “Sam Weller and Mr. Snodgrass,”\r\npresented Uncle Sam, “eight months after Germany went to war with us,\r\nand we severed relations with Germany as the first move in our sixty\r\ndays’ stern foremost drift into, not going to, war,” as the boastful\r\nMr. Snodgrass, still taking off his coat and announcing in a loud voice\r\nwhat he was about to do. This drew from the mayor of Abilene, Texas,\r\nthe following letter to The Star-Telegram, of Fort Worth, Texas, which\r\nwas publishing the Roosevelt articles:\r\n\r\n ABILENE, TEXAS, October 3, 1917. Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort Worth,\r\n Tex. The Roosevelt article appearing in your paper of this date\r\n is nothing short of the expression of the thoughts of a seditious\r\n conspirator who should be shot dead, and, the Editor-in-Chief of your\r\n paper should be tarred and feathered for publishing it, and your\r\n paper should be excluded from the mails of the United States. You may\r\n publish this if you wish, and stop my paper.\r\n\r\n  E. N. KIRBY\r\n  Mayor of Abilene\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fort Worth Star-Telegram promptly published Mayor Kirby’s letter,\r\nunder the caption “The Retort Courteous,” adding the following:\r\n\r\n The Editor-in-Chief presents his compliments to the Mayor of Abilene\r\n and begs to say that should he conclude personally to conduct a tar\r\n and feather expedition in our direction, he will experience no great\r\n difficulty in locating the said Editor-in-Chief. Meanwhile we can\r\n assure him that his reception will not be lacking in hospitality or\r\n warmth.\r\n\r\nThe mayor of Abilene and the editor did not meet. Later, in an\r\neditorial devoted to apologists for the delay in making war who were\r\nsaying, “Why cry over spilt milk?” Colonel Roosevelt referred to the\r\nincident, saying:\r\n\r\n Recently the mayor of Abilene, Texas, expressed his disapproval of my\r\n pointing out that we, as a Nation, had wholly failed to prepare, by\r\n saying that I was “a seditious conspirator who ought to be shot dead,”\r\n and that the editor of the newspaper publishing the article “should\r\n be tarred and feathered.” Although differing in method of expression,\r\n this slight homicidal bleat of the gentle-souled (and doubtless\r\n entirely harmless) mayor of Abilene, Texas, is exactly similar in\r\n thought to the utterances of all these sheeplike creatures who raise\r\n quavering or incoherent protests against every honest and patriotic\r\n man who points out the damage done by our failure to prepare.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nWhen the “cub reporter” came to take on his “new job,” he learned\r\nfor the first time of the conditions at Camp Funston, in Kansas, the\r\nbig national army training camp of the Middle West, to which his old\r\nfriend, Major-General Leonard Wood, had been assigned. The drafted men\r\nwere assembled there from the farms and towns of the Middle West before\r\nadequate provision had been made for their care or their training.\r\nThey were trained with wooden cannon, and broomsticks served in place\r\nof rifles. Colonel Roosevelt wrote an editorial entitled “Broomstick\r\nPreparedness,” which touched mildly on the conditions at Funston. The\r\nexpression “Broomstick Preparedness” caught popular fancy as typifying\r\nthe Administration’s delay in many aspects of war preparation. It\r\nstuck in the public mind. It was widely used by newspapers and by\r\nspeakers who thought the Government was not showing sufficient speed.\r\nAn editorial, “Broomstick Apologists,” followed, directed at people who\r\nanswered criticism of delay by making excuses for delay.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning Colonel Roosevelt had in the main devoted his\r\narticles to speeding up the preparations for making war. The boosting\r\nof Liberty bonds and the various war drives, the pacifists and\r\nhyphenated enemies on our own soil, were not overlooked by any means,\r\nbut the thing that seared his soul was the lack of speed in making\r\nready for actual warfare. When his connection with The Star began,\r\nwe had been officially at war nearly six months, and how little the\r\nGovernment had accomplished toward equipping for actual warfare was\r\ncontinuously held up in his articles.\r\n\r\nColonel Roosevelt used the method, followed by newspaper writers who\r\nearnestly seek to achieve results, of pounding continually on a few\r\nthings, dressing each article in different language, but keeping to\r\nthe front all the time the central idea, presenting the same thoughts\r\nin article after article, but striving in each so to change the\r\npresentation that the ideas would finally enter the reader’s mind and\r\nstir him to action. Mr. Nelson used this method in the conduct of The\r\nStar. For many years, beginning with its first publication, The Star\r\nadvocated parks and boulevards for Kansas City. It hammered away on the\r\nsubject in nearly every issue. It took almost twenty years to do it,\r\nbut at the end a splendid system of parks and boulevards stands as a\r\nmonument to The Star’s persistence.\r\n\r\nArticle after article Colonel Roosevelt devoted to the slow speed in\r\nwar-making until there was finally a response in Washington. It heard\r\nfrom public opinion. War-making was speeded up, although at the best\r\nand in the end there were many, many deficiencies in our war machine.\r\n\r\nColonel Roosevelt’s criticisms of the Administration were not widely\r\npopular. The Star never had any idea they would be popular, but it\r\nbelieved they were right and for the real good of the country. As he\r\nhad foreseen when the connection was made, “Many of your subscribers\r\nwill be perfectly furious at The Star for printing my editorials.”\r\nThey were. They wrote to The Star to denounce the Colonel for writing\r\nthe articles and The Star for printing them. In popular discussion in\r\nthe Middle West forms of disapproval ranged from “He should stand by\r\nthe President” to “He should be stood before a stone wall and shot.”\r\nGenerally the user of the latter phrase added “at sunrise.” That was an\r\nexpression often heard. It was used by political orators with effect.\r\nColonel Roosevelt knew full well of the feeling in the West and South\r\ntoward his articles. He wrote once asking what effect the storm was\r\nhaving on The Star. Never a word from him to show he cared one whit\r\nabout himself. He knew he was doing the right thing for the country; he\r\nwent ahead.\r\n\r\nThe frank truth is, there was a strong and active pacifist element\r\nin the territory in which The Star circulated. It had not been for\r\npreparedness. It had voted for President Wilson in 1916 largely\r\n“because he kept us out of war.” Undeniably that idea was popular.\r\nA candidate for governor in a neighboring state, running on the\r\nRepublican ticket, had made a campaign identical with the Democratic\r\nslogan and had carried the state, which at the same time gave its vote\r\nto the Democratic presidential candidate. But once we were in war the\r\npeople of this section responded nobly; they went to the limit, but for\r\na long time after we were in war they did not approve the prodding-up\r\nof Washington. The hostility toward the Roosevelt articles in the South\r\nwas more pronounced. At the beginning of the service ten Southern\r\nnewspapers were taking it. Their statements about discontinuance ran\r\nfrom “We find further publication inadvisable in our territory” to an\r\napology to their readers for ever having allowed the Roosevelt articles\r\nto enter their columns.\r\n\r\nColonel Roosevelt was not without defenders; many of them thought and\r\nsaid he was rendering the greatest service to the country in all his\r\ncareer. But in the excited state of mind in the spring of 1918, when\r\nthe Germans were driving toward Paris, it required courage to defend\r\nthe articles. Many, however, spoke out boldly; others did not. Party\r\nlines were not followed strictly. Republicans were not so bitter as\r\nmen of the President’s party. “We must stand by the President” had a\r\npopular appeal regardless of whether the Government was functioning\r\nefficiently or not. The view was widely held that it was unpatriotic\r\nto criticize the President. Frequently it was charged that Colonel\r\nRoosevelt’s purposes were political, not patriotic. The articles were\r\noften decried as pro-German propaganda and The Star was branded as\r\npro-German for publishing them.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1918, when this feeling was at its height, when the people\r\nin Kansas City’s territory were in a highly inflamed state of feeling\r\ntoward criticism of the Government, Colonel Roosevelt sent a ringing\r\neditorial, “Freedom Stands with her Back to the Wall,” which The Star\r\ndid not consider it advisable to publish. It had no doubt of the entire\r\nrighteousness of the criticism passed on the officials at Washington,\r\nfor the fruition of their slowness was shown in the poor showing\r\nAmerica was making in these critical days, but it could see no good\r\nto come from the publication: in its opinion the article would only\r\nfurther inflame Colonel Roosevelt’s enemies and irritate his friends.\r\nColonel Roosevelt was informed of the office opinion of this article\r\nas he was on a later article (“How Not to Adjourn Politics,” June\r\n25) which was not published. He acquiesced in the decision, saying\r\nthat he could readily conceive of local conditions which made their\r\npublication ill-advised. He asked that they be telegraphed to two\r\nother newspapers, which was done. The Star was willing to go as far as\r\nit could go without, in its judgment, lessening the effectiveness of\r\nthe articles in accomplishing the speeding-up of the war, but it would\r\nnot go beyond this point.\r\n\r\nIn July, when criticism had caused the removal of many inefficients at\r\nWashington and when American troops were beginning to reach France,\r\nThe Star was barred from the Public Library at Fulton, Missouri, an\r\nintensely Democratic town in Central Missouri, “for disloyalty to the\r\npresent Administration.” The notice read:\r\n\r\n DEAR SIR: By order from the library board of the Public Library I am\r\n advised to have you discontinue our subscription to The Daily Star\r\n and The Times. Disloyalty to the present Administration is the reason\r\n given for the action taken.\r\n\r\n  Yours sincerely\r\n  FRANCES F. WATSON\r\n  Librarian\r\n\r\nAnswering this editorially, The Star said that throughout the war\r\nit had taken the course of calling attention to the mistakes of the\r\nGovernment rather than remaining silent on its mistakes; that it\r\ndid not believe in saying the country was doing finely when it was\r\nnot; that it believed in exposing inefficiency and rooting it out.\r\nIt directed attention to results already accomplished by criticism\r\nin bringing into the war preparations men like Schwab, Goethals,\r\nStettinius, March, Baruch, and others, adding: “The Star is proud\r\nto belong to the little group of constructive critics, including\r\npreëminently Colonel Roosevelt, who worked to get wrong conditions\r\nchanged and to contribute to the present result, which to-day is the\r\nsalvation of the cause we fight for. For it to have done anything else\r\nwould have been faithlessness to its trust.”\r\n\r\nWhen at last the stirring-up of the Administration had borne fruit and\r\nAmerican troops were in France and on the way in considerable, though\r\ndisappointing, numbers, Colonel Roosevelt slowed down his bombardment\r\nof the Washington authorities. His campaign had produced results. He\r\nwas right in doing all he could to speed up war preparations, and\r\nhe stood his ground in the face of widespread censure in the way he\r\nalways did. Hostile newspapers had demanded that the Postmaster-General\r\nsuppress the circulation of the Roosevelt articles; indeed, a\r\npost-office inspector had visited Kansas City with the idea of denying\r\nThe Star admission to the mails, but the Administration made no further\r\nmove in this direction.\r\n\r\nEven when the turning of the tide had set in, Roosevelt’s demand was\r\nfor men, more men, and then more men for France. He would have in\r\nall six or seven million men in training, and four million American\r\nsoldiers in France in the spring of 1919. In the first article he sent\r\nafter the news of Quentin’s death, he said:\r\n\r\n Now and always afterwards we of this country will walk with our heads\r\n high because of the men who face death and wounds, and so many of\r\n whom have given their lives for this nation and for the great ideals\r\n of humanity across the sea. But we must not let our pride and our\r\n admiration evaporate in mere pride, in mere admiration of what others\r\n have done. We must put the whole strength of this nation back of the\r\n fighting men at the front. We owe it to them.\r\n\r\nLater on the good effect of Colonel Roosevelt’s criticism was widely\r\nrecognized. The Nation, one of the Colonel’s bitterest opponents,\r\nin general a strong supporter of the Administration, said of his\r\neditorials: “It is largely to him that we owe our ability to discuss\r\npeace terms and to criticize at all.”\r\n\r\nSumming up the effect of Colonel Roosevelt’s campaign to speed up our\r\npart in the war, The Star said editorially:\r\n\r\n There were periods of intolerance when neither Mr. Roosevelt nor The\r\n Star was under any illusions as to the reception that would be given\r\n frank criticism. But it was essential that such criticism be made in\r\n order to correct evils that were really threatening the outcome of the\r\n war....\r\n\r\n The selective draft was the big achievement of the Administration\r\n in 1917. But having prepared this, the Government proceeded in most\r\n leisurely fashion, apparently not getting the slightest comprehension\r\n of the danger to the Allied cause resulting from Russia’s collapse.\r\n\r\n The War Department continued to be run, as it had been in the past,\r\n by amiable old gentlemen who were wholly unfit for the task. Although\r\n airplanes had become an essential feature of modern warfare, it was\r\n not until weeks after war had been declared that the department sent a\r\n commission to Europe to learn what a military airplane was. Rifles are\r\n usually regarded as a part of the military equipment of troops. But it\r\n was two months after the declaration of war before the War Department\r\n decided what type of rifle to make. An army of millions of men was\r\n certain to need uniforms, but the easy-going quartermaster-general\r\n turned down the offer of the wool manufacturers’ association for the\r\n entire output of the country and the result was that the soldiers\r\n went into the winter without warm clothing or overcoats. As for\r\n artillery, the incapacity was complete.\r\n\r\n Meanwhile we sent a small expeditionary force to France, and in the\r\n autumn began sending troops across in a leisurely way, at the rate of\r\n ten thousand a week.\r\n\r\n Then suddenly, late in March, with the German army driving straight on\r\n Paris and the Allied defenses giving way, under the appeal of Lloyd\r\n George we suddenly woke to the fact that we had been playing with the\r\n war. From that time on we acted as if we had a man’s job, and we got\r\n into the line just in time to save the situation.\r\n\r\n All through the fall and winter of last year what Mr. Roosevelt and\r\n the other outspoken critics were trying to do was to arouse the\r\n country and the Administration to the magnitude of the task and to the\r\n danger from delay. They succeeded only partly. But they did succeed\r\n to the extent of forcing the removal of incompetent departmental\r\n chiefs, and the substitution of efficient men who were able to handle\r\n the emergency when the Administration finally discovered that the\r\n emergency existed.\r\n\r\n Looking back over the events of the last eighteen months, we believe\r\n no fair-minded American can fail to perceive the patriotic service\r\n done by Mr. Roosevelt and other critics, who were seeking to awaken\r\n the Government from a lethargy that just missed proving fatal to the\r\n Allied cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nColonel Roosevelt’s last visit to his desk in the editorial rooms of\r\nThe Star was early in October, 1918. It struck those who had been\r\nassociated with him that he was not quite as fit as usual. I asked\r\nhim if it were true the physicians had placed him on a diet. He\r\nsaid it was, but, to be frank, he had not given much heed to their\r\nrecommendations. In a discussion at his desk with men of the editorial\r\nforce a recent article about Roosevelt by George Creel came up. “I\r\nmust admit,” said Colonel Roosevelt, laughing, “he took a rather\r\njaundiced view of me.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kirkwood was away in the army, but Mrs. Kirkwood was in Kansas\r\nCity and the Colonel stayed at their home during his visit. At this\r\ntime a subject was brought up which had been talked over along in the\r\nsummer--a visit from him to the battle front to write at first hand\r\nof the American forces. Newspapers which were receiving the service\r\nand others which had heard of the suggestion were eager for Roosevelt\r\narticles from France, but from the first the Colonel had demurred and\r\nnow said a final “No.” His reason was that he could not go as a private\r\ncitizen, as he had been denied permission to go as a soldier; it would\r\nnot only be unbecoming for a former president of the United States\r\nto go in any newspaper capacity, but how to treat him would be an\r\nembarrassing question to France.\r\n\r\nThe tide had turned toward the Allies, and the country was certain the\r\ndefeat of the enemy was a question of a short time. Colonel Roosevelt’s\r\narticles turned to a discussion of the kind of peace there should be\r\nand examinations of the President’s “Fourteen Points” and his notes\r\nto Austria. On November 11--the day the armistice was signed--it was\r\nconsidered necessary for Colonel Roosevelt to go to a hospital in New\r\nYork. From his hospital room he telegraphed that day an editorial\r\njoining in the general rejoicing over peace and appraising tersely our\r\npart in the war.\r\n\r\nA few days later there came an editorial prompted by a letter from a\r\nwoman friend in California. Visiting this friend was another woman\r\nwhose son had died of influenza in the navy. That mother had said she\r\nhad given her boy proudly to her country, “but if only he could have\r\ndied with a gun in his hand--a little glory for him and a thought for\r\nme that my sacrifice had not been useless.” The California friend had\r\nwritten: “There must be other mothers who feel they have laid their\r\nsacrifices on cold altars. You have written much that will comfort the\r\nmothers whose sons have paid with their bodies in battle. Isn’t there\r\nsomething you can say to comfort these other mothers?”\r\n\r\nThe letter touched Colonel Roosevelt deeply. “I felt a real pang when\r\nI received this letter,” he wrote, “because the thought suggested had\r\nbeen in my mind and yet I had failed to express it.” The editorial,\r\n“Sacrifices on Cold Altars,” which he wrote in response, gave\r\nconsolation from the heart. It made it clear that all who had given\r\ntheir lives in the country’s service, whether in action or from\r\ndisease, stood on “an exact level of service and sacrifice and honor\r\nand glory.” It concluded:\r\n\r\n The mother or wife whose son or husband has died, whether in battle\r\n or by fever or in the accident inevitable in hurriedly preparing a\r\n modern army for war, must never feel that the sacrifice has been laid\r\n on “a cold altar.” There is no gradation of honor among these gallant\r\n men and no essential gradation of service. They all died that we might\r\n live; our debt is to all of them, and we can pay it even personally\r\n only by striving so to live as to bring a little nearer the day when\r\n justice and mercy shall rule in our own homes and among the nations\r\n of the world.\r\n\r\nFrom his entrance to the hospital until his departure on Christmas\r\nday, the editorials were less frequent. The Peace Conference, the\r\nCongressional elections, and the League of Nations were uppermost\r\nin public thought, and on these subjects the Colonel wrote several\r\neditorials. Both Colonel Roosevelt and The Star were anxious to\r\nfind some means to lessen the chance of war through international\r\norganization. Both feared, from President Wilson’s addresses, that he\r\nhad in view some grandiose plan that would be impractical. In December\r\na member of The Star’s staff visited the Colonel in Roosevelt Hospital,\r\nNew York. At that time he had written one or two editorials discussing\r\nthe subject in a tentative way. He was asked if he did not think he\r\ncould say something more positive.\r\n\r\n“I doubt it,” he said. “I feel there is so little that really can\r\nbe done by any form of treaty to prevent war that it would be\r\ndisappointing for me to point it out. Any treaty adopted under the\r\ninfluence of war emotions would be like the good resolutions adopted\r\nat a mass meeting. We have an anti-vice crusade. Everybody is aroused.\r\nThe movement culminates in a big meeting and we adopt resolutions\r\nabolishing vice. But vice isn’t abolished that way.”\r\n\r\nCorrespondence on the subject followed, and December 28, 1918, he wrote\r\nthis letter to the member of the staff who had been talking with him:\r\n\r\n In substance, or, as our friends the diplomats say, in principle, I\r\n am in hearty accord with you. But do you really think we ought to\r\n guarantee to stand with France and Italy in all future continental\r\n wars? It’s a pretty big guarantee and I don’t know whether it would be\r\n made good. Indeed, I don’t know whether it ought to be made good. I am\r\n most heartily with France and England now, but I certainly would not\r\n have been with France fifty years ago or with England sixty years ago,\r\n and our clear duty to antagonize Germany has slowly become apparent\r\n during the last thirty or forty years. Remember that you are freer to\r\n write unsigned editorials than I am when I use my signature. If you\r\n propose a little more than can be carried out, no harm comes, but if I\r\n do so it may hamper me for years. However, I will do my best to write\r\n you such an article as you suggest: and then probably one on what I\r\n regard as infinitely more important, namely, our business to prepare\r\n for our own self-defense.\r\n\r\n As for Wilson having with him the bulk of the people who are taken in\r\n by this name [The League of Nations], I attach less importance to this\r\n than you do. He is a conscienceless rhetorician and he will always\r\n get the well-meaning, foolish creatures who are misled by names. At\r\n present anything he says about the World League is in the domain of\r\n empty and windy eloquence. The important point will be reached when he\r\n has to make definite the thing for which he stands.\r\n\r\nThe article written in response to the promise in this letter was\r\nColonel Roosevelt’s last contribution to The Star. It was dictated at\r\nhis home at Oyster Bay, January 3, which was Friday. His secretary\r\nexpected to take it to him for correction the following Monday. Instead\r\nan early call on the telephone that morning told of his passing away in\r\nhis sleep.\r\n\r\n  RALPH STOUT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROOSEVELT IN THE KANSAS CITY STAR\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. FITZSIMONS’S DEATH[1]\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 17, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first name on the casualty list of the American army in France is\r\nthat of Dr. William T. Fitzsimons, of Kansas City, killed in a German\r\nair raid on our hospitals. Dr. Fitzsimons had already served for some\r\ntime in a French hospital. As soon as this Nation went to war he\r\nvolunteered for service abroad.\r\n\r\nThere is sometimes a symbolic significance in the first death in a war.\r\nIt is so in this case. To the mother he leaves, the personal grief\r\nmust in some degree be relieved by the pride in the fine and gallant\r\nlife which has been crowned by the great sacrifice. We, his fellow\r\ncountrymen, share this pride and sympathize with this sorrow. But\r\nhis death should cause us more than pride or sorrow; for in striking\r\nfashion it illustrates the two lessons this war should especially teach\r\nus--German brutality and American unpreparedness.\r\n\r\nThe first lesson is the horror of Germany’s calculated brutality. As\r\npart of her deliberate policy of frightfulness she has carried on a\r\nsystematic campaign of murder against hospitals and hospital ships.\r\nThe first American in our army to die was killed in one of these\r\ntypical raids. We should feel stern indignation against Germany for the\r\nbrutality of which this was merely one among innumerable instances.\r\nBut we should feel even sterner indignation towards--and fathomless\r\ncontempt for--the base or unthinking folly of those Americans who aid\r\nand abet the authors of such foul wickedness; and these include all men\r\nand women who in any way apologize for or uphold Germany, who assail\r\nany of our allies, who oppose our taking active part in the war, or who\r\ndesire an inconclusive peace.\r\n\r\nThe second lesson is our unpreparedness. We are in the eighth month\r\nsince Germany went to war against us; and we are still only at the\r\nreceiving end of the game. We have not in France a single man on the\r\nfighting line. The first American killed was a doctor. No German\r\nsoldier is yet in jeopardy from anything we have done.\r\n\r\nThe military work we are now doing is work of preparation. It should\r\nhave been done just three years ago. Nine tenths of wisdom is being\r\nwise in time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Although Colonel Roosevelt did not begin his regular contributions\r\nto The Star until October 1, the death of Dr. W. T. Fitzsimons, of\r\nKansas City, moved him to send this article.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOOD, IRON, AND GOLD\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 23, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nBismarck announced that his policy for Germany was one of blood and\r\niron. The men who now guide, and for some decades have guided,\r\nGerman international policy have added gold as the third weapon in\r\nGermany’s armory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PAGE OF THE MANUSCRIPT OF ONE OF ROOSEVELT’S\r\nEDITORIALS]\r\n\r\nTo a policy based on callous disregard of death and suffering, and\r\nthe brutal use of force, they have added the habitual and extensive\r\nemployment of corruption as a means for weakening their foes and\r\nbending other nations to their service.\r\n\r\nThe Administration at Washington recently made public the proof that\r\nAmbassador Bernstorff, on behalf of the German Government, was, up to\r\nthe very last moment of his stay, engaged in efforts to bribe with\r\nGerman money American organizations or individuals who could be used to\r\nfurther Germany’s purpose by protesting against war, demanding peace\r\nat any price, opposing the measures necessary for war, denouncing\r\nthe Allied nations, praising unpreparedness, or by some other of the\r\nmethods habitual with pro-German Senators, Congressmen, editors, heads\r\nof peace societies and the like.\r\n\r\nNo well-informed man was surprised at the revelation. Every reasonably\r\nwell-informed man, who has known about matters at Washington, has\r\nknown that for nearly three years German money and governmental power\r\nhas been used for the corruption of American newspapers and pacifist\r\norganizations and for the pay of German, and the bribery of native,\r\nscoundrels to wreck our industries with dynamite and in all ways\r\ndebauch our political life. The Government, from the highest official\r\ndown, knew all these facts over two years ago. The New York World\r\npublished the names of some of the editors and other individuals who\r\nhad received money, and the amounts received. The Austrian Ambassador,\r\nDumba, and two of the German attachés, Boy-Ed and Von Papen, were\r\ndismissed for inspiring and countenancing the intrigues. It was\r\nabsolutely impossible that what they did was not ordered and supervised\r\nby Bernstorff, under the direction of the Berlin Government. It was\r\ndeeply to our discredit that we did not then show the courage and\r\nmanliness to break at once with Germany, instead of hiding our heads in\r\nthe sand so as to avoid seeing the guilt of the German Government, and\r\npunishing the minor instruments of wrongdoing who, under no conceivable\r\ncircumstances, would or could have acted save as their superiors bade\r\nthem act. Germany has hitherto been able to do but little against us\r\nwith blood and iron; gold has been her weapon, and her agents have been\r\nthe foes of our own household.\r\n\r\nEvery man in this country who is now playing the pro-German game\r\nshould be made to feel that he must overcome a presumption of guilty\r\nmotive. There are misguided pro-Germans who are uninfluenced by corrupt\r\nmotives, just as there were in the Civil War copperheads who were\r\nmerely misguided and not conscious wrongdoers. But these men are in\r\nmighty unpleasant company!\r\n\r\nThe pacifist, the man who wishes a peace without victory, the supporter\r\nof Senator La Follette or Senator Stone, the man who in any way now\r\naids Germany, may be honest; but he stands cheek by jowl with hired\r\ntraitors, and he is serving the cause of the malignant and unscrupulous\r\nenemies of his country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GHOST DANCE OF THE SHADOW HUNS\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 1, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nTen days ago a ghost dance was held in St. Paul under the auspices\r\nof the Non-Partisan League, with Senator La Follette as the star\r\nperformer. We have the authority of the German Kaiser for the use of\r\nthe word Hun in a descriptive sense, as representing the ideal to which\r\nhe wished his soldiers in their actions to approximate. It is therefore\r\nfair to use the word descriptively as a substitute for the German\r\nin this war. It is also fair to use it descriptively of the German\r\nsympathizer in this country, of the man who aids and abets Germany by\r\ncondoning the German offenses against us, by seeking to raise class\r\ndivision in this country, with, of course, the attendant benefit to\r\nGermany; by screaming against the war, or in favor of an inconclusive\r\npeace; or by belittling or sneering at or declaring inopportune the\r\neffort to arouse the spirit of Americanism. The Americans who thus\r\nserve Germany deserve the title of Shadow Huns.\r\n\r\nIt was to me a matter of sincere regret to have the Non-Partisan League\r\nplay the part it did at St. Paul in connection with the meeting\r\nwhich Senator La Follette addressed. They held what was in effect a\r\ndisloyalty day festival. When the Non-Partisan League movement was\r\nfirst started, I was inclined to hail it, because I am exceedingly\r\nanxious to do everything in my power to grapple with and remedy every\r\ninjustice or wrong or mere failure to give ample opportunity to the\r\nfarmer. With most of the avowed objects and with some of the methods of\r\nthe Non-Partisan League I was in entire sympathy, although there were\r\ncertain things it did which I felt should be condemned, and certain\r\nways of achieving its objects which I believed to be mischievous. But\r\nwhen the League, on the disloyalty day in question, ranged itself on\r\nthe side of the allies of Germany and the enemies of this country,\r\nit became necessary for every loyal American severely to condemn it.\r\nMorally, although doubtless not legally, it thereby came perilously\r\nnear ranging itself beside the I.W.W., the German-American Alliance,\r\nand the German Socialist party machine in America.\r\n\r\nWhen I spoke in Minneapolis three men spoke from the same platform\r\nwith me. One was that fine and loyal American, Governor Burnquist,\r\nof Swedish ancestry. One was a blacksmith, born in Sweden, a former\r\nmember of the Socialist party, who left the party within the last six\r\nmonths when he became convinced that it was the tool or ally of German\r\nautocracy. The third was another working-man, of German birth.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting in Wisconsin I was on the platform with the Mayor of\r\nRacine, an American citizen of German birth. My companions throughout\r\nthe trip were Judge Harry Olson, of Swedish parentage, and Mr.\r\nOtto Butz, of German parentage, both of whom represent that kind\r\nof Americanism to which we all must subscribe if we are to be good\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nThe Americanism of all these men is the Americanism I profess, and it\r\nis the exact antithesis of the attitude of the Shadow Huns, who, under\r\nthe lead of native-born Americans like Messrs. La Follette and Townley,\r\nby their utterances, stir dissensions among our own people and weaken\r\nus in the prosecution of the war.\r\n\r\nThe two working-men of whom I speak, the man born in Sweden and the man\r\nborn in Germany, spoke with rugged emphasis of their devotion to this\r\ncountry, and of their sense of the duty of every man fit to be called\r\nan American in this crisis. They emphasized the fact that Germany’s\r\nsocial system was based upon the duty of the average man to cringe\r\nbefore the insolence of his superiors and his right himself to behave\r\nwith insolence to his inferiors. It is for this system of cringing\r\nabasement before the powerful, and of brutal insolence to the weak\r\nfor which the Shadow Huns in this country stand when they directly or\r\nindirectly talk against our Government for going to war or talk against\r\nany step which it takes for the efficient waging of the war; and, above\r\nall, when they directly or indirectly apologize for or champion Germany.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of every American citizen fearlessly, but truthfully,\r\nto criticize not only his Government but his people, for wrongdoing,\r\nor for failure to do what is right. It is his duty to obey the\r\ninjunction of President Wilson by insisting upon pitiless publicity of\r\ninefficiency, of subordination of public to private considerations,\r\nor of any other form of governmental failure to perform duty. Such\r\ncriticism is absolutely indispensable if we are to do our duty in this\r\nwar, and if we are to adopt a permanent policy of preparedness which\r\nwill make this Nation safe. But the men who oppose the war; who fail\r\nto support the Government in every measure which really tends to the\r\nefficient prosecution of the war; and above all who in any shape or way\r\nchampion the cause and the actions of Germany, show themselves to be\r\nthe Huns within our own gates and the allies of the men whom our sons\r\nand brothers are crossing the ocean to fight.\r\n\r\nI do not admire these Shadow Huns. But least of all do I admire those\r\namong them, whether Senators, Congressmen, or public officials of any\r\nother kind who, although on Uncle Sam’s pay-roll, nevertheless seek to\r\nstab Uncle Sam in the back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAM WELLER AND MR. SNODGRASS\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 2, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nReaders of “Pickwick,” if such there still be, will recall the time\r\nwhen Mr. Pickwick was arrested and some of his followers resisted\r\narrest. Sam Weller made no boasts; but he spoiled the looks of various\r\nopponents. Mr. Snodgrass began ostentatiously to take off his coat,\r\nannouncing in a loud voice that he was going to begin. But he gave no\r\nfurther trouble.\r\n\r\nOver eight months have elapsed since Germany went to war with us,\r\nand we severed relations with Germany as the first move in our sixty\r\ndays’ stern foremost drift into, not going to, war, but admitting\r\nthat we were already at war. During those eight months we have paid\r\nthe penalty for our criminally complete failure to prepare during the\r\nprevious three years by not having yet to our credit one single piece\r\nof completed achievement. The Administration has unwisely striven to\r\ncover this past failure to prepare, and present failure to achieve, by\r\noccasional grandiloquent pronunciamentos as to the wonderful things\r\nwe are going to do in the future; and usually the language used is\r\ndesigned to convince ignorant people that these things have already\r\nbeen done.\r\n\r\nOne day it is announced that we have discovered an infallible remedy\r\nagainst submarine attacks; and the next day it is announced that the\r\ntoll by submarines is heavier than during any previous month. We read\r\nthat the British drive is successful, but stubbornly resisted; that\r\nsome thousands of prisoners have been taken; and that the losses have\r\nbeen terribly heavy. We read at the same time that we are going to have\r\nan immense army of aircraft--some time next spring. And actually there\r\nis less boasting over the former statement than over the latter! We\r\nread of the valor and suffering of the French in some heroic assault;\r\nand the Administration proudly announces that, after eight months, the\r\ndrafted men are beginning to assemble in their camps--and omits to\r\nmention that they have neither guns nor uniforms, are short of blankets\r\nand sweaters.\r\n\r\nSo far the Sam Wellers who have done things are our allies. Uncle\r\nSam is still complacently engaged in taking off his coat, like Mr.\r\nSnodgrass. Under such circumstances it is unwise for him to announce\r\noverloudly what he is going to do when at last he begins. Let him wait\r\nuntil he has done it; and meanwhile bend all his energies to doing it,\r\nand doing it soon. Brag is a good dog. But Holdfast is a better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBROOMSTICK PREPAREDNESS\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 4, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nAt present we Americans have two prime duties.\r\n\r\nThe first is to make the best of actual conditions; to prepare our\r\narmy, navy, merchant marine, air service, munition plants, agriculture,\r\nfood conservation, and everything else as speedily as possible, so as\r\nto fight this war to a completely victorious conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe second is not to fool ourselves, but to face the fact of our\r\ncomplete and lamentable unpreparedness. And to inaugurate a policy of\r\npermanent preparedness which will prevent our ever again being caught\r\nin such a humiliating condition.\r\n\r\nThe men of the national guard and of the drafted army are of admirable\r\ntype. I do not believe that any other great nation can produce quite\r\ntheir equals on such a scale as we can; the zeal, energy, and adaptable\r\nintelligence with which they are doing all they can in the various\r\ncamps must be a matter of pride for all Americans. There is all the\r\nmore reason why such first-class material should be given a first-class\r\nchance for speedy and efficient action. It has not been given that\r\nchance. The steps we as a nation are now taking ought to have been\r\ntaken three years ago. Failure to take them then has meant broomstick\r\npreparedness now. Failure to take them as a permanent policy now means\r\nbroomstick preparedness in some future vital crisis when we may not\r\nhave allies willing and able to protect us while we slowly prepare to\r\nmeet the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe Ordnance Bureau of the War Department admits that we have not\r\nrifles for our national army, but attempts to excuse matters by saying\r\nthat it is of no consequence because we shall have rifles a few months\r\nhence when our men are ready to go abroad. The admission is correct.\r\nThe excuse is not. Even for training, it is better to arm infantrymen\r\neach with the weapon he is to use rather than to give each man a\r\nbroomstick or to give every four men an antiquated rifle which cannot\r\nbe used in service, and most of our artillery regiments at present\r\neither have no guns or wooden guns or, in rather rare cases, old-style\r\nguns which cannot be matched against any present-day artillery.\r\nMoreover, and this is the vital point, we now have the time to prepare\r\nonly because the English and French fleets and armies protect us. Eight\r\nmonths have passed since Germany openly went to war with us. As yet\r\nwe have not rifles for our infantry. As yet we have not guns for our\r\nartillery. It will be at least a year after we were dragged into the\r\nwar before our army will have received the weapons with which we are to\r\nwage the war.\r\n\r\nThis is broomstick preparedness, and there is not the slightest use in\r\ntrying to justify or excuse broomstick preparedness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BONDHOLDERS AND THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 7, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nNot many years ago one of the favorite cries of those who wished to\r\nexploit for their own advantage the often justifiable popular unrest\r\nand discontent was that “the people were oppressed in the interest\r\nof the bondholders.” The more ardent souls of this type wished to\r\nrepudiate the national debt, to “wipe it out as with a sponge,” in order\r\nto remove the “oppression.” The bondholders were always held up as\r\ngreedy creatures who had obtained an unfair advantage of the people as\r\na whole.\r\n\r\nWell, the Liberty Loan now offers the chance to make the people and the\r\nbondholders interchangeable terms. The bonds are issued in such a way\r\nthat the farmer and the wage-worker have exactly the same chance as the\r\nbanker to purchase and hold as many or as few as they wish. No matter\r\nhow small a man’s means, he can get some part of a bond if he wishes.\r\nThe Government and the big financiers are doing all they can to make\r\nthe sale as widely distributed as possible. Some bankers are serving\r\nwithout pay in the effort to put all the facts before the people as a\r\nwhole, and so make the loan in very truth a people’s loan. It rests\r\nwith the people themselves to decide whether it shall be such.\r\n\r\nThe Government must have the money. It is a patriotic duty to purchase\r\nthe bonds. And they offer an absolutely safe investment. The money\r\ninvested is invested on the best security in the world--that of the\r\nUnited States; of the American Nation itself. The money cannot be lost\r\nunless the United States is destroyed, and in that case we would all\r\nof us be smashed anyhow, so that it would not make any difference.\r\nThe people can, if they choose, now make themselves the bondholders.\r\nIf they do not so choose, and if they force Wall Street to become the\r\nlargest purchaser of the bonds, which must be bought somehow, then they\r\nwill have no right in the future to grumble about the bondholders as a\r\nspecial class. We can now, all of us, join that class if we wish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTORIES OF GOOD CITIZENSHIP\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 10, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nThe training camps for the drafted men of the national army are huge\r\nfactories for turning out first-class American citizens. Not only are\r\nthey fitting our people for war; they are fitting them for the work\r\nof peace. They are making patriotism, love of country, devotion to the\r\nflag, and a sense of duty to others living facts, instead of unreal\r\nphrases. The public schools are laboratories of Americanism for our\r\nchildren; the training camps are laboratories of Americanism for our\r\nyoung men.\r\n\r\nI have just seen a party of drafted men from the East Side of New\r\nYork City start for Camp Upton with a band playing, an American flag\r\nflying. And two of their number in front, one dressed as Uncle Sam,\r\nand the other as the Kaiser, dragged along in manacles. There is no\r\nfifty-fifty Americanism in men with such spirit. A captain at this\r\ncamp, a Plattsburg man, told me that his company of East Side New\r\nYorkers showed all the intelligence and the zealous desire to learn\r\nwhich the fine young college graduates at Plattsburg have shown.\r\nAnother captain told me that one of his men, a young Jew, had come\r\nto him and said that at first the East Siders had hated coming, not\r\nknowing what was ahead of them, but that now they felt that they were\r\nin a University of American Citizenship. A surgeon in the camp told me\r\nthat men also, proved physically lacking after a week’s trial, were\r\nin most cases bitterly chagrined at being sent away. A colonel from\r\na Southern camp has reported that already his country boys from the\r\nremote farms are straightening and broadening morally, mentally, and\r\nphysically, and that the improvement is really incalculable. From every\r\ncamp we hear of the eagerness with which the men are doing their duty,\r\nof their resourcefulness and of the real patriotism which is being\r\nrapidly learned. All this means not merely good soldiers in war, but\r\ngood citizens in peace; it means an immense growth in the spirit of\r\nAmericanism.\r\n\r\nThe young men are learning to be efficient, alert, self-respectful and\r\nrespectful of others; they are learning to scorn laziness, slackness,\r\nand cowardice. All are serving on a precise equality of privilege\r\nand of duty and are judged each only on his merits. The sons of the\r\nforeign-born learn that they are exactly as good Americans as any one\r\nelse, and when they return to their home their families will learn it,\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nLet all good Americans insist that now, without delay, we make this\r\nstate of affairs our permanent national policy by law. We have\r\nbuilt the camp, we have encountered the failures to provide army\r\nuniforms and blankets and all the other exasperating delays which are\r\ninevitable when a nation like ours has foolishly trusted to broomstick\r\npreparedness. We shall avoid all these things for the future if we\r\ncontinue these camps, as permanent features of the life of all our\r\nyoung men, and change the selective draft unto a system of universal\r\nobligatory military training for all our young men of nineteen and\r\ntwenty, it being understood that they are not to go to war until they\r\nare twenty-one. We are now suffering, and the whole world is now\r\nsuffering, from the effects of our broomstick preparedness. Let us do\r\naway with broomstick preparedness for the future and substitute real\r\npreparedness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPILLAR-OF-SALT CITIZENSHIP\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 12, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Lot’s wife was journeying to safety, she could not resist looking\r\nback to the land she had left and was thereupon turned to a pillar of\r\nsalt. The men from the Old World who, instead of adopting an attitude\r\nof hearty and exclusive loyalty to their land, try also to look\r\nbackward to their old countries, become pillars-of-salt citizens, who\r\nare not merely useless, but mischievous members of our commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe dispatches of the German Government, just published by the State\r\nDepartment, give us an illuminating glimpse, not only of German methods\r\nand of German conduct towards this country, but also of certain phases\r\nof our own citizenship. The German Government proposed to use this\r\ncountry as a basis of operations for wrecking the Canadian railway. It\r\nalso proposed to use and pay its agents and certain of our citizens for\r\n“sabotage in every kind of American factory for supplying munitions of\r\nwar,” and for “a vigorous campaign to secure a majority in both houses\r\nfavorable to Germany.” The German staff, in issuing these directions\r\nand in naming certain American citizens as tools for the treacherous\r\nwork, insisted that the embassy should not be compromised and that\r\n“similar precautions must be taken in regard to Irish pro-German\r\npropaganda.”\r\n\r\nGood citizens who have been misled by false counsel must now clearly\r\nsee that the campaign of dynamite against our industries, with the\r\nattendant wreckage and murder, was a deliberate act of secret war by\r\nthe German Government; that the attempt by Americans to secure an\r\nembargo on sending munitions to the Allies was an effort to aid Germany\r\nin thus making war on the United States; that the Irish pro-German\r\nmovement in this country was financed and guided from Germany, and that\r\nour citizens, whether of foreign or native birth, whether of native\r\nAmerican or German or Irish origin, who took part in pushing these\r\nmovements, were doing substantially the same kind of work that Benedict\r\nArnold once tried to do.\r\n\r\nSome of them were doubtless paid, others were doubtless not paid,\r\nbut the paid and the unpaid alike were serving Germany against the\r\nUnited States. These matters are now all of public record. The excuse\r\nof ignorance can no longer avail any one. Henceforth the citizens of\r\nGerman or Irish birth who take part in such activities as those of most\r\nof the German-American alliances and the like, are at best standing in\r\nthe position of pillar-of-salt citizenship; at worst they, and above\r\nall their native American associates, who now indulge in pacifist\r\nmovements or demand a peace without overwhelming victory or ask for\r\na referendum on the war, or in any other way serve the brutal and\r\nconscienceless ambition of Germany, stand unpleasantly near the lonely\r\neminence occupied by Benedict Arnold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBROOMSTICK APOLOGISTS\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 14, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief of the Ordnance Bureau of the army, in commenting on the\r\nshortage of rifles, has said that it is of no consequence, because\r\n“every soldier will be supplied a rifle when he starts for France.”\r\n\r\nOf course he will, otherwise he cannot start. One of the leading papers\r\nof New York backs up the statement by saying that the “drilling in the\r\ncamps without rifles is ended now” and that “General Crozier delayed\r\nthe work so as to get rifles with the same ammunition our allies are\r\nusing.”\r\n\r\nNeither statement is correct. The last is the reverse of truth. On\r\nOctober 2 in one camp there were still only one hundred rifles for\r\ntwenty thousand men and other camps were scarcely better off, and the\r\ndelay in getting rifles during the last eight months has been due\r\nprimarily to the refusal of the Ordnance Department to get rifles using\r\nthe ammunition of our allies.\r\n\r\nIf during the two years preceding our entry into the war the Government\r\nfactories had been run full speed, we would have had over two million\r\nof Springfield rifles instead of under one million. Our shortage was\r\ndue solely to our policy of dawdle. Our factories produced a mere\r\ndribble of rifles and no big field guns until the inevitable happened.\r\n\r\nWar came. Having no rifles of our own for the new army, the War\r\nDepartment decided to adopt the English rifle, the Enfield, which was\r\nbeing built in this country at the rate of nearly nine thousand a day\r\nin private plants, and by speeding them up the number could have been\r\nimmediately increased to fourteen thousand a day. But the authorities\r\ninsisted that the Enfields should be changed to take our ammunition,\r\nand that certain parts should be standardized and made interchangeable.\r\nAs regards this excuse, it is sufficient to point out that in the\r\nfirst place it was a very grave error, while making the parts of our\r\nEnfields interchangeable, at the same time to make their ammunition not\r\ninterchangeable with that of the British Enfields, for the number of\r\nSpringfields on hand was negligible compared to the millions of rifles\r\nwe would ultimately need, and in the second place the delay even for\r\nthis purpose was wholly inexcusable. The German submarine note came on\r\nJanuary 31. An alert War Department would have had its rifle programme\r\nminutely mapped out within two weeks. The delay in furnishing final\r\nspecifications to the factories was such that they could not begin on\r\nthe complete rifle until the latter part of August. Six months is a\r\n“perfectly endurable delay” only if we are content to accept the speed\r\nstandards in war of Tiglath-Pileser and Pharaoh Necho. The United\r\nStates must learn to adopt the war speed standards of the Twentieth\r\nCentury, A.D., instead of those of the Seventh Century, B.C.\r\n\r\nIf in April we had been ready to proceed with the Enfield rifle, we\r\nwould now have about two million of the new rifles instead of about\r\none-fiftieth of that number. General Crozier says that we have only had\r\nto wait “two or three months--a perfectly endurable delay.” Surely if\r\nthere is anything this war teaches it is the vital importance of time.\r\nTwo or three months’ waiting in order to get a rifle which does not\r\ncarry the ammunition of our allies represents not merely an undesirable\r\ndelay but grave unwisdom.\r\n\r\nGeneral Crowder handled the draft to perfection because he appreciated\r\nthat the difference between sending a telegram at 5 or at 4:45 might\r\nbe of momentous consequence. General Crozier has bungled the rifle\r\nsituation because of the attitude which makes him regard two or three\r\nmonths as “a perfectly endurable delay.”\r\n\r\nFor two years and a half before entering the war we relied upon\r\nbroomstick preparedness. For the first eight months of the war we have\r\nfollowed the same policy as regards the vital matter of rifles for our\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIBERTY LOAN AND THE PRO-GERMANS\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 16, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Victor Berger, the Socialist leader of Milwaukee, is reported in\r\nthe press as sneering at the Liberty bonds, berating the Administration\r\nfor, as he says, appointing thirty-three wealthy capitalists on the\r\nNational Council of Defense, and in effect seeming to persuade his\r\nhearers that they ought, at this crisis of foreign war, to be hostile\r\nto those of their countrymen who are “capitalists” instead of the\r\nKaiser.\r\n\r\nThis is natural. The Socialist party machine in this country is run by\r\nGermans. Socialists, who were sincerely desirous of social betterment\r\nand who were sincere in this hatred of tyranny and wrongdoing, have\r\nleft the Socialist party. Those who remain in it have turned it into a\r\nmere tool of the brutal militaristic autocracy which now threatens the\r\nworld. These men are completely dominated by the Germans, and German\r\nSocialists in America have shown in this crisis that they are Germans\r\nfirst, Socialists a long way second, and not Americans at all. In\r\nfact, they are venomously hostile to the country in which they dwell\r\nand claim citizenship, and are eagerly ready to sacrifice Socialism\r\nitself to the interests of the Germany of the Hohenzollerns. They stand\r\nwell to the front among the Shadow Huns who, within our gates, are the\r\nallies of the Huns without our gates.\r\n\r\nWhile in Wisconsin I was told that the German-American Alliance, in its\r\nefforts to persuade American citizens to betray their citizenship in\r\nthe interests of Germany, had relatively as many adherents among the\r\nSocialists as among the two great parties.\r\n\r\nWhen the Socialists under such leadership oppose or sneer at the\r\nLiberty Loan, it is proof positive that all patriotic citizens should\r\nbuy Liberty bonds up to the limit of their ability. The Socialists\r\nattack the Liberty Loan in order to hurt America and help Germany.\r\nThe domination of “American capitalism” is a mere blind to obscure the\r\nservice they are trying to render to the capitalists and militarists of\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nFor the composition of the National Council of Defense, I am sorry\r\nthat more labor men and farmers are not on it, but I wish they could\r\nbe put on in addition to, not as substitutes for, the men of means who\r\nare on it, for these men of means, taken as a whole, have at much cost\r\nto themselves rendered devoted and invaluable service to the Nation.\r\nTheir absence would be a general calamity to America and a great aid\r\nto Germany, and all true lovers of America should recognize this\r\nfact. I know some of these men personally, and those whom I know have\r\nsacrificed time, effort, and money in order to be of help to the Nation\r\nat this juncture. In fact, I have never known more devoted public\r\nservice than that they rendered at this crisis.\r\n\r\nIt is unpatriotic at this time to attack good Americans because they\r\nhave capital and are trying to make this capital of service in the\r\nwar. Capital is necessary to business and industry, and in this war\r\nindustrial efficiency is almost as necessary as military skill. The\r\nfactories at home are almost as important as the armies in the field.\r\nWise war taxation of capital and profits is eminently necessary, but it\r\nmust not go to an extent that will interfere with production and the\r\nforward movement of business, or widespread calamity would result.\r\n\r\nWe are a great Nation, engaged in a stupendous war. Let us use dollars\r\nas we use the loaded shells, and each can do its best work only under\r\nthe leadership of the ablest man: the business man in one case, the\r\nmilitary man in the other. By all means let the people be masters of\r\nthe capital of the country at the present time. The surest way to do\r\nthis is for the people themselves to buy the Liberty bonds and not\r\nleave them to Wall Street. They are the one absolutely safe investment,\r\nboth for men of small means and men of large means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DIFFICULT QUESTION TO ANSWER\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 18, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nA correspondent in Pueblo, Colorado, writes me as follows:\r\n\r\n By what logic are we “at peace” with Austria, when she is furnishing\r\n troops or artillery to Germany to fight and kill our soldiers on the\r\n western front? The same question might apply to Turkey. Remember, too,\r\n that we are furnishing money and supplies to Italy, our ally, in her\r\n struggle with Austria. The Western folks are looking to you to answer\r\n hard questions of this sort for us which we don’t understand.\r\n\r\nNeither I nor any one else can satisfactorily answer the question.\r\nA limited liability war in which we fight Germany ourselves and pay\r\nmoney to Italy and Russia to enable them to fight Austria and Turkey,\r\nwith whom we are at peace, savors of sharp practice and not of\r\nstatesmanship. It is a good rule either to stay out of war or to go\r\ninto it, but not to try to do both things at once.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this matter squarely tests our sincerity when we announced\r\nthat we went to war to make the world safe for democracy. The phrase\r\nmust have been used in a somewhat oratorical fashion, anyhow, because\r\nwe have ourselves within the last year or two made the world entirely\r\nunsafe for democracy in the two small and weak republics of Haiti and\r\nSan Domingo. Therefore, the phrase must have meant that we intended to\r\nmake the world safe for well-behaved nations, great or small, to enjoy\r\ntheir liberty and govern themselves as they wished. If it did not mean\r\nthis, the phrase was much worse than an empty flourish, for it was\r\ndeliberately deceitful. If it did mean this, then we are recreant to\r\nour promise unless we at once go to war with Austria and Turkey.\r\n\r\nBoth these nations are racial conglomerates, in which one or two\r\nnationalities tyrannize over other subject nationalities. The world\r\nwill not and cannot be safe for democracy until the Armenians, the\r\nSyrian Christians, and the Arabs are freed from Turkish tyranny, and\r\nuntil the Poles, Bohemians, and Southern Slavs, now under the Austrian\r\nyoke, are made into separate, independent nations, and until the\r\nItalians of Southwest Austria are restored to Italy and the Rumanians\r\nof Eastern Hungary to Rumania.\r\n\r\nUnless we propose in good faith to carry out this programme, we have\r\nbeen guilty of a rhetorical sham when we pledged ourselves to make\r\nthe world safe for democracy. The United States must not make promises\r\nwhich it has no intention of performing. We are breaking this promise\r\nand incidentally are acting absurdly every day that we continue at\r\nnominal peace with Germany’s fellow tyrants and subject allies, Austria\r\nand Turkey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW HELP THE LIBERTY LOAN\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 20, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nThe concrete services to the United States which every decent American\r\nnot fortunate enough to be a soldier can now render, is to buy as many\r\nLiberty bonds as he can afford.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury Department has set forth in the public press the facts\r\nabout the campaign which the pro-Germans in the United States are\r\nwaging against the Liberty Loan. The campaign is being waged by trying\r\nto prevent banks from handling the Liberty Loan, and by the publication\r\nin certain newspapers of articles tending to discourage people from\r\ninvesting in the bonds. Senator La Follette’s speeches, which are to\r\nthe same effect, are also being circulated with a view to check popular\r\nsubscriptions. Senator La Follette, by the way, represents exactly\r\nthe type which tries to prevent the people from owning the bonds and,\r\nnevertheless, will in the future probably rail at the purchasers of the\r\nbonds as having, somehow or other, obtained an improper and excessive\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the enemies of the Liberty Loan are of this type, all\r\npatriotic Americans should strain every nerve to make the sale a\r\nsuccess. Moreover, this happens to be one of those rare cases where the\r\nperformance of a patriotic duty is a first-class financial investment.\r\nThe patriot is rendering a great service to the Nation while he is also\r\nmaking a capital investment for himself. If the people do not take the\r\nbonds, they will be taken by the big capitalists. The people have the\r\nfirst call, and while it is desirable in the interest of everybody to\r\nmake this a people’s loan, it is more desirable from the standpoint of\r\nthe people themselves. The investment is absolutely safe. The men and\r\nwomen who fail to take advantage of it are not standing by the country\r\nand they are not standing by their own interests. Every man, from the\r\nday laborer to the bank president, should, according to his means,\r\ninvest in the Liberty bonds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SQUARE DEAL FOR THE TRAINING CAMPS\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 21, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Playgrounds and Recreation Association of America has undertaken a\r\ncapital work in pushing the War Camp Community Committee, of which Mr.\r\nJohn N. Willys, of Toledo, is chairman. The War Camp Committee work\r\nfor Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and Colorado has made\r\nMr. I. R. Kirkwood chairman, and has begun an active drive to get the\r\nthree-quarter of a million dollars allotted to this district out of the\r\ntotal of four million to be raised in the country.\r\n\r\nThe movement should receive the heartiest backing. It represents much\r\nmore even than the very important work of providing amusements for the\r\nhundreds of thousands of enlisted men in the various camps, for it\r\nalso has to deal with the moral and sanitary surroundings, not only\r\nin camps, but in the neighboring towns and cities. In former wars the\r\nnumber of men incapacitated by diseases contracted in the camps often\r\nsurpassed the number incapacitated by the sickness due to the hardships\r\nand exposure at the front. This was because of lax supervision of the\r\nneighborhood moral and sanitary conditions, and also from failure to\r\ninstruct the soldiers that it is a shameful and unsoldierly thing to\r\nexpose themselves to disease due to indulgence in vice.\r\n\r\nThe committee is working not only in the interests of national morality\r\nand decency. It is also working in the interest of military efficiency,\r\nfor it will save scores of thousands of soldiers from being shamefully\r\nincapacitated before reaching the front, and the gain to the Nation\r\nfrom the economical as well as the moral standpoint, after the war,\r\nwill be very great.\r\n\r\nThe work of the committee will be carried on outside the camps in the\r\nadjacent communities acting in coöperation with churches, clubs, and\r\norganizations of public-spirited men and women. It will be wholly\r\ndifferent from the work inside the camps, which is done by the\r\nY.M.C.A., the Knights of Columbus, the Y.M.H.A., and similar bodies.\r\nIn many places the local authorities already have done much work along\r\nthe lines sketched by the national committee, and wherever this is the\r\ncase, the national committee will surely aid the local bodies.\r\n\r\nAll good and patriotic men and women should heartily back this work to\r\nkeep Uncle Sam’s soldiers clean, decent, and self-respecting; to make\r\nthem better citizens and more formidable fighting men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PASSING OF THE CRIPPLE\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 23, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nIf men are alert, resolute, and energetic, they can usually secure some\r\ncompensation from any calamity. This dreadful war, attended by the\r\nkilling and crippling of men on a scale hitherto unknown, has brought\r\nas a compensation a determined move to do away with the cripple; that\r\nis, to cease the mere effort to keep a crippled man alive and, instead,\r\nto endeavor by reconstructive surgery to restore him to himself and to\r\nthe community as an economic asset.\r\n\r\nSurgeon-General Gorgas and his associates have worked out, and are\r\nready practically to test, an organized system under which any\r\nseemingly crippled man is to be kept under the guidance of the medical\r\nbranch of the army until either the usefulness of the damaged part\r\nhas been restored or else until he has been trained in other ways so\r\nas to enable him measurably to overcome the handicap. In almost every\r\ncase something will be done to make the cripple less of a burden\r\nto himself and others, and in most cases, the army medical service\r\nconfidently believes, the cripple will once more become a useful and\r\ntherefore a happy citizen. In all our special hospitals that are now\r\nbeing planned, the curative workshop is part of the plant. The effort\r\nis to be not only for the physical development and physical reëducation\r\nof the wounded part, but also for any intellectual training necessary\r\nto produce new forms of effective ability which will offset any loss\r\nin physical ability. The aim is not merely to save the life of, and\r\nthen turn loose, a crippled pensioner who can be little but a burden\r\non the community; it is to take care of the wounded man until the very\r\nbest of which he is capable has been developed, so that when once more\r\nin the outside world he will be a real asset to the Nation. This is a\r\nfine thing for the Nation, and is of incalculable consequence from the\r\nstandpoint of the self-respect and happiness of the man.\r\n\r\nThis represents the complete reversal of the old point of view, which\r\nwas that the cripple was turned loose with a pension for less than what\r\nif sound in body he would have earned, and a burden on the community.\r\nThe purpose of Surgeon-General Gorgas and his associates is that the\r\nGovernment shall stand behind the man and invest money in him so as to\r\ndevelop all his latent resources, fitting him to make good as a citizen\r\nand expecting him thus to make good. There will be, where necessary, a\r\nmoney compensation for the injury, but the great compensation will be\r\nthe return to useful life of the man himself.\r\n\r\nThe far-reaching effect of such a policy is evident. The purpose is\r\nto insist that every man, no matter how maimed, shall be made of\r\nfurther use in the world. If once the army acts on this theory, the\r\ngreat industries will follow suit. The cripple, in the sense of being\r\na helpless or useless cripple, will largely be eliminated, and out\r\nof this war will have come another step in the slow march of mankind\r\ntowards a better and more just life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEACE OF COMPLETE VICTORY\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 23, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is stated in a press report from Washington that the Allies wish the\r\nUnited States to stop sending men abroad and use its ships for food and\r\nmunitions instead, but that the Administration will not agree to the\r\nplan, and furthermore that the Administration is determined that there\r\nshall be no peace until Germany is completely beaten. If the report is\r\ncorrect, the Administration is absolutely right on both points.\r\n\r\nAs to the first point, we can well understand, in view of the steady\r\nU-boat campaign, how greatly the Allies desire food and munitions, and\r\nwe regret with bitter shame the folly of our Government in dawdling\r\nand delaying for six vital months after the German note of January 31\r\nlast before seriously beginning the work of building big, swift cargo\r\nboats. But this cannot alter the fact that for the sake of our honor\r\nand our future world usefulness we must ourselves fight and not merely\r\nhire others to fight for us. If we do not follow this course, our\r\nchildren’s heads will be bowed with humiliation. With proper energy we\r\ncould already have had some hundreds of thousands of men in the firing\r\nline, and we should send our troops over as rapidly as possible, with\r\nthe purpose to put at least two million men against the German lines\r\nnext year, an entirely possible programme if the Government will lend\r\nits energies with a single mind to the task.\r\n\r\nAs regards the second point, every decent citizen should make the\r\npacifist and the home Hun realize that agitation for a premature\r\npeace, for a peace without victory, is seditious. Shame on every man,\r\nand above all on every public servant and every leader of public\r\nopinion, who endeavors to weaken the determination of America to see\r\nthe war through and at all costs secure an overwhelming triumph for\r\nthe principles for which we contend. If Germany is left unbeaten,\r\nthe Western Hemisphere will stand in cowering dread of an assault by\r\nGermany’s ruthless and barbarous autocracy. The liberties of the free\r\npeoples of the world are at stake.\r\n\r\nWe must now fight with all our might on European soil beside our allies\r\nor else fear the day when we will have to fight without allies beside\r\nour burning homes. While this war lasts, the cause of our allies is\r\nour cause, their defeat would be our defeat, and whoever assails them\r\nor defends Germany is a traitor to the United States. There must be\r\nno negotiated peace. Belgium is entitled to an enormous indemnity and\r\nFrance to annexation of Alsace and Lorraine. By her marine murders and\r\nher shore raids and her utter treachery and abominable cruelty, Germany\r\nhas made herself the outlaw among nations, and with her we should\r\nnegotiate only through the mouths of our cannon. All who now advocate\r\na negotiated peace with her are seeking to betray civilization in the\r\ninterest of brute force and international outrage. The United States\r\nowes her entrance into this war almost as much to the American pacifist\r\nas to the German militarist, and now the former is meanly eager once\r\nmore to serve the latter by securing an unjust peace. Let every brave\r\nand patriotic American spurn the base counsels of the pro-Germans\r\nand pacifists, and insist that this country, at whatever cost, fight\r\nsteadfastly until the war closes with Germany’s complete overthrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIGHTING WORK FOR THE MAN OF FIGHTING AGE\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 25, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Y.M.C.A. is one of the most powerful agencies for good in our\r\nmilitary camps here at home and with our armies abroad. It would be\r\na veritable calamity not to have it do this work. The women and the\r\nelderly men who have gone abroad under present conditions are rendering\r\na patriotic service of high value, but every young man of fighting age\r\nwho has gone abroad for the Y.M.C.A. at this time is a positive damage\r\nto the work and should be instantly sent home. It is an ignoble thing\r\nfor an able-bodied man to be in such a position of bodily safety where\r\nhis example must naturally excite contempt and resentment among the men\r\nwho, unlike him, are risking their lives and have left their families\r\nfor the sake of a great ideal. Of course, no man of draft age should\r\nbe sent over, but this is not enough. The draft represents merely the\r\nminimum performance of duty. No man of age to permit his entering the\r\narmy abroad or at home should be sent over. If any such man is not\r\nin the army, it should be either because he has been turned down by\r\nthe army authorities for physical reasons or because his work at home\r\neither for his family or for the Government imperatively demands his\r\npresence here. If he is able to go abroad at all, he should go abroad\r\nin the army. The fact that he is abroad for the Y.M.C.A. is proof\r\npositive that he has no business to be there.\r\n\r\nAn officer in high command in France recently wrote home a letter,\r\nwhich I have seen, describing the experiences of the junior\r\nofficers of his command with some of the young able-bodied Y.M.C.A.\r\nrepresentatives. He began by an emphatic testimony to the admirable\r\nwork the Y.M.C.A. had done and to its great importance, and by an\r\nemphatic statement that it had a thoroughly bad effect on the enlisted\r\nmen to see a young man of their own age engaged in such work. He then\r\nillustrated its effect on the young officers with whom these Y.M.C.A.\r\nmen messed, writing:\r\n\r\n Two young Y.M.C.A. men have been at two of the battalion messes. They\r\n are of the age whose presence here is an annoyance to the army because\r\n they seem to have been exempted from the draft. They have obtained\r\n bullet-proof jobs and their presence here is a bad example to all\r\n the young men in the army. Last night at one mess the officers were\r\n so disgusted with the Y.M.C.A., who was actually wearing a uniform\r\n with an officer’s belt on, that they began to chaff him, telling him\r\n that they were married men and were entitled to play safety first\r\n themselves and thought they would apply for jobs in the Salvation\r\n Army. The Y.M.C.A. had to stand for this because he was the only\r\n unmarried man there, and it is said that his mother persuaded him that\r\n he owed her a duty not to go in a dangerous place. He evidently feels\r\n his duty keenly. The other young fellow from the Y.M.C.A. was a real\r\n man and he left the soft job and has enlisted as a private.\r\n\r\nThe Y.M.C.A. is so very useful an organization that it is profoundly to\r\nbe regretted that it should in any way damage its usefulness. Its work\r\nwith the armies abroad should be done exclusively by women and elderly\r\nmen. No able-bodied man under forty-five should represent the Y.M.C.A.\r\nin the war zone or with the army camps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWISE WOMEN AND FOOLISH WOMEN\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 27, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are wise and foolish women just as there are wise and foolish\r\nmen, and in any great crisis the welfare of this country depends\r\nupon the extent to which the wise and patriotic men and the wise and\r\npatriotic women can offset or overcome the folly of the foolish.\r\n\r\nThe woman who bravely and cheerfully sends her men to battle when the\r\ncountry calls takes her place high on the national honor roll. She\r\nstands beside the mothers and wives of the men of ’76 and of the men\r\nwho wore the blue and the gray in the Civil War. Where would this\r\ncountry now be if Washington’s mother had not raised her boy to be a\r\nsoldier for the right?\r\n\r\nBut the women who do not raise their boys to be soldiers when the\r\ncountry needs them are unfit to live in this republic. The women who at\r\nthis time try to dissuade their husbands or sons who are of military\r\nage from entering the army or navy are thoroughly unworthy citizens.\r\nThe kind of affection which shows itself by refusing to allow the boy\r\nto face hard work when it is his duty to do so, the mother who brings\r\nup her boy to be a worthless idler, because she is too fond of him to\r\nsee him suffer the discomfort of hard work, and the mother who desires\r\nher boy to play the coward or the shirk, in time of war, are not merely\r\nfoolish; they are poor citizens. They are the real enemies of their\r\nsons, for there can be no more dangerous enemy than the human being,\r\nman or woman, who teaches another human being to lose his soul in order\r\nto save his body. The wise mother is the best of all good citizens\r\nand the foolish mother stands almost at the other end of the scale.\r\nI wish every mother in the land could read Theodosia Garrison’s poem,\r\nrecently sent out by that stirring body of patriots, the Vigilantes. It\r\ndescribes the youth of twenty years, eager to play a manly part while\r\nhis mother seeks to hold him from the post of danger and duty, and two\r\nof the verses run:\r\n\r\n  Mother of his twenty years, who holds against his will\r\n  The eager heart, the quick blood, and bids them to be still,\r\n  What of the young untrammeled soul you seek to blunt and kill?\r\n\r\n  You would save the body stainless and complete,\r\n  Fetters on the hands of it, shackles on the feet;\r\n  And in the crippling of them make soul and body meet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY CRY OVER SPILT MILK?\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 28, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nNice, short-sighted persons, when the evil effects of our folly in\r\nfailing to prepare are pointed out, sometimes ask, “Why cry over spilt\r\nmilk?” The answer is that we wish to be sure that we do not spill it\r\nagain, and, unfortunately, the nice persons who bleat against any one\r\nwho points out our shortcomings in preparedness or who excuse and\r\nchampion those responsible for this unpreparedness, are doing all they\r\ncan to invite future disaster for the Nation.\r\n\r\nThe bleat assumes different expressions in different localities.\r\nRecently the Mayor of Abilene, Texas, expressed his disapproval of my\r\npointing out that we, as a Nation, had wholly failed to prepare, by\r\nsaying that I was “a seditious conspirator who ought to be shot dead,”\r\nand that the editor of the newspaper publishing the article “should be\r\ntarred and feathered.” Although differing in method of expression, this\r\nslightly homicidal bleat of the gentle-souled (and doubtless entirely\r\nharmless) Mayor of Abilene, Texas, is exactly similar in thought to\r\nthe utterances of all these sheeplike creatures who raise quavering or\r\nincoherent protests against every honest and patriotic man who points\r\nout the damage done by our failure to prepare.\r\n\r\nThese persons cannot deny one fact I state. Nine months have passed\r\nsince, on January 31, Germany sent us a note which was practically a\r\ndeclaration of war. We have only just put troops in the trenches; many\r\nof the troops of our draft army training at home have until recently\r\nonly had broomsticks, and now only have one old Spanish War rifle for\r\nevery eight soldiers; most of the artillery regiments in these camps\r\neither have no guns or wooden guns. After nine months we are still\r\nwholly unable to defend ourselves or to render efficient military aid\r\nto our allies, and we owe safety from invasion only to the protection\r\nof the fleets and armies of the war-worn and weary nations to whose\r\nhelp we nominally came. No man can truthfully deny these statements,\r\nno man can seriously regard this situation as satisfactory. To try\r\nto cover up the truth by bluster and brag and downright falsehoods\r\nmay possibly deceive ourselves, but will deceive no one else, whether\r\nfriend or foe. Is such foolish deceit worth while?\r\n\r\nNine tenths of wisdom is being wise in time. We were not wise in time.\r\nLet us learn from our past folly future wisdom. Our first duty is to\r\nwin this war, and therefore the Shadow Hun within our gates is our\r\nworst internal foe. Our next and equally important duty is to prepare\r\nagainst disaster in the future, and therefore our next worst internal\r\nfoe is the sheeplike creature who invites national disaster for the\r\nfuture by bleating against the telling of the truth in the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVE THE FOODSTUFF\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 30, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Hoover has been appointed as the man to lead us of this Nation in\r\nthe vitally important matter of producing and saving as much food as\r\nwe possibly can in order that we can send abroad the largest possible\r\namount for the use of our suffering allies and for the use of our own\r\ngallant soldiers. Mr. Hoover’s preëminent services in Belgium pointed\r\nhim out as of all the men in this country the man most fit for the\r\nvery position to which he has been appointed. Let us give him our most\r\nhearty and loyal support.\r\n\r\nIn this great and terrible war the slaughter, starvation, and\r\nexhaustion are on a scale never before known. They are nation-wide.\r\nTherefore every individual of every nation engaged must do his full\r\npart or else must be held to have failed in his duty. The man of\r\nfighting age must fight. The man with especial business capacity or\r\nmechanical skill must produce arms or equipment or ammunition. And\r\nevery man, woman, or child must help produce food if possible, and in\r\nany event must help economize it.\r\n\r\nMr. Hoover has asked us during this week to devote ourselves to getting\r\nall our people voluntarily to pledge themselves to certain forms of\r\nfood economy,--which are of great consequence from the standpoint of\r\nsending abroad the foodstuffs needed by our Allies and by our own\r\ntroops. There are certain foods which are easily transported which are\r\nnourishing and which are peculiarly suited for the use both of our\r\nallies and of our troops in the field. Mr. Hoover’s plan is that we\r\nshall all of us voluntarily limit along strict lines our consumption\r\nof these food products and replace them by other foods which are not\r\nsuitable for sending abroad, and that we shall rigidly avoid waste.\r\nFull particulars are given in the pamphlets sent out by Mr. Hoover from\r\nhis Washington Bureau of Food Conservation.\r\n\r\nWhat Mr. Hoover asks entails not the slightest real hardship on any of\r\nus. It merely requires each of us to exercise a little self-control and\r\nperhaps to make some trivial sacrifice of personal preference in what\r\nwe eat. Surely this is a very, very small service to be rendered by us\r\nstay-at-homes in support of our sons and brothers who have gone or are\r\ngoing to risk their lives in battle for us and mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE FIRING LINE\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 31, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nOur men are now actually on the firing line, and while, of course, they\r\nare as yet there primarily for purposes of instruction, nevertheless,\r\nthey are there. They are at times under fire. They are at any moment\r\nliable to death in upholding the honor of their country, of your\r\ncountry, my reader, and of mine.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pershing’s original division under his direction and\r\nthe direction of his lieutenants, such as Major-General Sibert,\r\nBrigadier-General Duncan, and their associates, has evidently been\r\ntrained to a high point of efficiency. The accounts show that the\r\ninfantry effected their entrance to the trenches with the precision\r\nof veterans. Evidently the artillery is being handled with similar\r\nefficiency. Apparently, from the account, our artillerymen are using\r\nFrench guns.\r\n\r\nAll Americans must feel a glow of pride as he reads of the soldierly\r\nmanner in which our American troops have made their entry into the\r\nfire zone. But we must not confine ourselves merely to feeling pride\r\nin our fellow countrymen who are at the front risking their lives\r\nin doing their duty on behalf of all of us. We must back them up.\r\nWe must support the Government in every movement taken efficiently\r\nto put the strength of this Nation behind our soldiers, and we must\r\nvigilantly insist upon the efficiency including the speed absolutely\r\nindispensable. We must support the Liberty Loans, conserve food,\r\ncheerfully pay taxes, and tolerate neither improper profit-making out\r\nof the war by capitalists or strikers,--nor slackness and malingering\r\nwhich interferes with our military efficiency by laboring men. Every\r\nAmerican civilian should now do his work with the same sense of duty as\r\nis shown by the soldiers in the field.\r\n\r\nAnd now let good patriots keep in mind that the Huns within our gates\r\nfrom this time on are the allies of the Huns who are actually doing\r\nbattle against our soldiers at the front. The men who directly or\r\nindirectly advise people not to take Liberty bonds, the men who clamor\r\nfor an early peace, an inconclusive or negotiated peace, the men who\r\ncondone the offenses of Germany directly or indirectly, the men who say\r\nwe have not ample cause for war against Germany, the men who attack our\r\nallies or seek to breed dissension between them and us, are each and\r\nevery one to a greater or less degree acting as friends of Germany and\r\ntherefore as enemies of the United States. Every patriotic American\r\nshould now clearly understand what is really implied in the attitude\r\ntaken during the last nine months by the Stones and La Follettes,\r\nthe Hearsts and Hillquits. These men are out of place in America.\r\nIt is sincerely to be regretted that they cannot be put where they\r\nbelong--under the Hohenzollerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNINE TENTHS OF WISDOM IS BEING WISE IN TIME\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 1, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days ago I expressed in The Star the regret and uneasiness\r\nfelt by all men with knowledge of international matters at the\r\nfailure of this country to declare war on Austria and Turkey. Various\r\nAdministration, and, of course, the leading pro-German, newspapers took\r\nexception to this statement and announced that the procedure advocated\r\nwould be unwise or improper. Since then the great defeat of the Italian\r\narmy by the Germans and Austrians has occurred, and among the Italians\r\nthere has been much bitter criticism of our failure to help them,\r\nalthough we have now for many months been at war, at least in theory,\r\nwith Germany.\r\n\r\nA leading Administration newspaper of high standing, the Brooklyn\r\nEagle, accurately states the case as follows:\r\n\r\n Italy’s defeat is shocking and alarming. Only its unexpectedness\r\n excuses the failure of Italy’s allies, including ourselves, to meet\r\n it. This Government cannot evade responsibility if Italy is lost, for\r\n we have been up to the present, quite as indifferent as the rest of\r\n the Entente to Italy’s fate. Italy suffers and is endangered by our\r\n own negative attitude. We have loaned her money, but we are not at\r\n war with Austria, and we have failed to give Italy such whole-hearted\r\n support as her critical position demands. No time should be lost in\r\n reversing this policy. Italy is fighting our battles as well as her\r\n own. She is a valuable ally; her cause is just. No effort should be\r\n spared to save her. There is no time to compromise or equivocate. Our\r\n own soldiers in Europe will have to pay in blood for every hour’s\r\n delay in throwing all possible help to Italy.\r\n\r\nThis is the exact truth. I call attention to the fact that it is from\r\na strong supporter of the Administration and that it takes the view\r\nI have for months been taking, and which various well-meaning but\r\nsheeplike creatures have bleated against on the ground that it implies\r\ncriticism of the Administration. I was merely advocating before the\r\nevent the course, which, after the event, all will agree ought to have\r\nbeen followed. It is in this matter precisely as it was in regard to\r\nour building ships to meet the terrible U-boat menace. We should, with\r\nthe utmost energy and speed, have begun to build them within a week,\r\nwithin a day, of the German note of January 31. Instead of this we\r\ndawdled and wrangled for six months before seriously beginning. In\r\nthe one case as in the other foolish creatures did immense harm by\r\nprotesting against pointing out our blunders on the ground that we must\r\nnot speak of spilt milk, whereas, of course, we can only stop future\r\nspilling by showing where it has been spilt in the past.\r\n\r\nNine tenths of wisdom is being wise in time, is the lesson as taught\r\nafresh by the Italian disaster and the shortage of cargo ships. Let us\r\nat last profit by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWE ARE IN THIS WAR TO THE FINISH\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 2, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nThe disaster to our Italian ally should make every American worth\r\ncalling such awake to the real needs of the hour and should arouse in\r\nhim the inflexible purpose to see that this war is fought through to a\r\nvictorious conclusion, no matter how long it takes, no matter what the\r\nexpense and loss may be.\r\n\r\nOur first troops are now actually in the trenches; American infantry\r\nand American artillerymen are under fire; blood has been shed. Our sons\r\nand brothers have begun the trench life of wearing fatigue, of cold, of\r\ninconceivable hardship and exposure and of cruel danger. A few women\r\nat home suffer as much. Otherwise, no civilians outside the regions\r\nconquered by the Germans can begin to realize the terrible strain to\r\nwhich constantly increasing numbers of our soldiers will be exposed as\r\nadditional divisions are trained for and put into the actual fighting.\r\n\r\nWe who stay at home must back up those men in every way. We must stand\r\nby and energetically support every effort of the Government to add to\r\ntheir efficiency and to back them up, including the sending over of\r\nconstantly increasing numbers of soldiers to the aid of the men already\r\nthere. We must back up the loans and taxes necessary in order to supply\r\nthem with arms, munitions, equipment, food, hospitals. We must hold\r\nto the strictest accountability before the bar of public opinion any\r\nGovernment official responsible for needless delay, or for shortage in\r\nshipping, clothing, or material, or for deficient ammunition, or faulty\r\ngas-masks, or for any other shortage which exposes our men at the\r\nfront to needless danger and hardship. We must make their effort and\r\ntheir suffering avail by highly resolving that the whole power of this\r\nNation, and all its resources in men and in wealth, shall be used to\r\nbring the peace of complete and overwhelming triumph over Germany and\r\nover Germany’s subject allies, Austria and Turkey.\r\n\r\nFinally, every brave and patriotic American owes it to the men at the\r\nfront to make the lash of scorn felt by the Hearsts and La Follettes\r\nand by all others like them. These men have given or now give aid\r\nand comfort to Germany, and therefore show themselves enemies to the\r\nsoldiers in the American uniform by opposing the war, or by asking for\r\nan inconclusive peace, or by assailing the allies of the United States,\r\nor by condoning or keeping silent concerning the hideous atrocities\r\nwhich have made the Prussianized empire of the Hohenzollerns the arch\r\nenemy of every liberty-loving and self-respecting civilized nation on\r\nthe face of the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSINISTER ALLIES\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 3, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are well-meaning, but not overwise, persons who bleat against\r\nany sincere and truthful effort to make us more efficient in this war\r\nby protesting against grave shortcomings. These worthy persons should\r\nrealize that they are acting against the interest of the United States\r\nand in the interest of Germany. If they doubt this, they have only to\r\nponder the fact that in their attitude they stand beside such sinister\r\nallies as German papers like the New York Staats Zeitung and Illinois\r\nStaats Zeitung and the various papers of Mr. Hearst.\r\n\r\nThese papers have opposed our going to war, or have assailed our\r\nallies, or have condoned or passed over in silence the brutal infamy\r\nof Germany. They have opposed the Government in its actions against\r\nGermany. In so doing they have been the enemies of America. And they\r\nhave been no less the enemies of America when they have eagerly\r\ndefended the Government from criticism for shortcomings which impair\r\nour efficiency and therefore tell in favor of Germany. Exactly as they\r\nonce opposed preparedness, or excused the murderous sinking of the\r\nLusitania, or protested against our going to war, so they now zealously\r\nexhibit a sham loyalty of the most hurtful kind by denouncing honest\r\nand truthful men because they tell the truth.\r\n\r\nIn order really to serve this country, it is necessary to point out\r\nthe dreadful damage done by our failure to prepare; of the evil effect\r\nof trying to train our troops with broomsticks and wooden guns; the\r\nworse than folly of failing to declare war on Austria and Turkey, and\r\nthe harm done by the delays, including the dawdling for six months\r\nbefore we began the vitally necessary work of shipbuilding. To cover\r\nup such shortcomings deceives no one but ourselves. Germany knows all\r\nabout them. We help her to find out by our failure to treat her spies\r\nwith drastic severity. And the men who suffer know all about them;\r\nthe artillerymen with only a wooden cannon, or the sentry in a cotton\r\nuniform on a cold night stands in no need of enlightenment on the\r\nsubject. When these pro-German papers with loud professions of loyalty\r\nprotest against telling our people the truth about such matters, they\r\nare merely serving Germany against the United States.\r\n\r\nLoyalty to the Nation demands that we subscribe to the Liberty Loans;\r\nthat we practice food conservation; that we ardently support sending\r\nour soldiers abroad until we have millions of men on the firing\r\nline; that we stand for universal obligatory military training and\r\nservice; that we heartily uphold our allies and condemn as traitors\r\nto America all who attack them; that we insist on prosecuting the war\r\nto complete victory and condemn as false to this country all who seek\r\nan inconclusive peace. Loyalty to the Nation no less demands that we\r\nmake our people understand the lasting harm done by our failure to\r\nprepare during the two and a half years before the war broke out and\r\nthe grave damage now caused by needless delay, by irresolution, by the\r\nappointment or retention of inefficient men, and by any and all types\r\nof half-heartedness in waging the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW YORK MAYORALTY ELECTION\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 8, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nThe triumph of Tammany in New York City and the large Socialist vote\r\nhave in some quarters been hailed as showing that New York City is for\r\npeace at any price and that it is against the Administration. Neither\r\nstatement is warranted by the facts.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist vote was about one-fifth of the total vote. It included\r\nmost of those who wished the war stopped at once, this number being\r\nmade up of professional pacifists, of red flag Anarchists, and of poor,\r\nignorant people who pathetically believed that a Socialist mayor would\r\nsomehow bring peace at once. But it also included its professional\r\nSocialists and poor, ignorant people who did not think of the war, but\r\nwho pathetically believed that a Socialist mayor would somehow give\r\nthem five-cent milk. The voters in New York City who wish immediate\r\npeace without any regard to national honor, or to what future horrors\r\nsuch a peace would bring, are certainly less than a fifth of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe vote was not anti-Administration. A far larger proportion of the\r\nsupporters of the Administration voted for Mr. Hylan than for Mr.\r\nMitchel, and officially the Administration was neutral between the two.\r\nA goodly number of pro-Germans supported Mr. Hylan, but he was also\r\nsupported by a large number of entirely loyal men, and he himself,\r\nunlike the Socialist candidate, Mr. Hillquit, was avowedly for America\r\nagainst Germany, and for the prosecution of the war. The election in\r\nactual fact turned directly on local issues. New York occasionally\r\nwitnesses an occasional insurrection of virtue, but the city has\r\nnever in fifty years given a good administration a second term. The\r\ninsurrection of virtue at one election is followed by a Tammany\r\nrevival at the next.\r\n\r\nThe result of the election in New York City was not heartening\r\nto patriotic persons, but right next door, in the Connecticut\r\ncongressional district which includes Bridgeport, a contest for a\r\nvacant congressional seat resulted in a way that speaks well for the\r\nRepublic. The Republican candidate, Schuyler Merritt, a man of high\r\nprobity and capacity, with a forward look in international affairs,\r\ncame out in bold and straightforward fashion, saying he would support\r\nthe President in all measures for the efficient prosecution of the\r\nwar until victory came, that he would do all he could to prevent our\r\nagain falling into the condition of shameful unpreparedness we had for\r\nthree years occupied, and that he was for universal obligatory military\r\ntraining for our young men. He won by a majority much greater than that\r\nwhich his predecessor received at the time of the presidential election\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN HATRED OF AMERICA\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 13, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have recently been published various books by Americans who,\r\nduring the Great War, have officially represented this country in\r\nGermany and in Belgium, when the Germans conquered it. Ambassador\r\nGerard is one writer. Mr. Gibson, secretary of our legation at\r\nBrussels, is another. Mr. Curtis Roth, until recently vice-consul at\r\nPlauen, Saxony, is a third. Their testimony is of profound significance\r\nbecause of their official position and personal standing.\r\n\r\nTwo facts leap to the eye from their writings. The first is that the\r\nGerman people have stood practically united behind their Government\r\nin upholding and insisting upon the systematic infliction of hideous\r\nbrutality upon their foes. With deliberate purpose the German\r\nGovernment has carried on a war of horror, a war of obscene cruelty, of\r\nwholesale slaughter, of foul treachery and bestiality, a war in which\r\ncivilians, including women, children, nurses, doctors, and priests,\r\nas well as wounded soldiers, have been murdered wholesale. The German\r\npeople have enthusiastically supported and approved their acts. Our\r\nwar is as much with the German people as with their Government, and we\r\nshould regard with loathing all Americans, whether men or women, who\r\nany way attempt to justify or defend Germany’s action. The Americans\r\nwho so act are traitors to their country and to humanity at large.\r\n\r\nThe second fact is the extreme malevolence of hatred with which Germany\r\nregards America, a hatred which blossomed into full growth before we\r\nwent to war, and which was immensely aggravated because of the contempt\r\ninspired by our tame submission to outrage for over two years. Mr.\r\nRoth’s testimony is peculiarly interesting. He shows that the Berlin\r\nGovernment actively stimulated the campaign of hatred and revenge\r\nagainst America, that the German people eagerly accepted the view\r\nthat Americans were cowardly, avaricious, and effeminate, and that in\r\nGermany it was constantly announced that, sooner or later, there would\r\nbe a day of reckoning when America would have to pay a huge indemnity\r\nor suffer the fate of Belgium.\r\n\r\nMr. Roth shows that the German people think exactly as their leaders\r\nthink. They now hate and despise us Americans as they hate others of\r\ntheir foes. Says Mr. Roth:\r\n\r\n They are resolved to make our country drink to the dregs out of the\r\n bitter cup of humiliation. Nothing do they find more despicable\r\n than our talk about peace, which they attribute to cowardice and\r\n flabbiness. They look on the American pacifist as a weakling, as a\r\n God-given tool in the hands of German interest.... The Germans, if\r\n possible, feel more bitterly towards Americans of German extraction\r\n than towards Americans of other lines of descent.\r\n\r\nGermany has definitely decided on America’s ruin. She has definitely\r\ndecided that there must be an intense anti-American spirit in both\r\nGovernment and people. She may bide her time, and she will doubtless\r\ntry to separate us from our allies, but her purpose towards us is both\r\nrelentless and ruthless.\r\n\r\nIf we are true to ourselves, if we prepare our armed strength and keep\r\nit prepared, if we show farsightedness and valor of soul, we can be\r\nsternly indifferent to this foul and evil hatred. But we must keep\r\nsteadily in mind that Germany respects nothing whatever except courage\r\nand prepared strength and that the pacifists and pro-Germans, the Huns\r\nwithin our gates, the Hearsts and the La Follettes, are playing the\r\ngame of our German foes, and if they have their way will bring shame\r\nand disaster to our land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTART THE SYSTEM OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY TRAINING AT ONCE\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 17, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General S. B. M. Young, U.S.A., retired, gave long,\r\nfaithful, and efficient service to this country, from the beginning of\r\nthe Civil War, for nearly half a century. But he never has rendered\r\ngreater service than by his steady insistence upon the immediate\r\nintroduction by law in this country of the system of obligatory\r\nuniversal military training as our permanent policy. This should be\r\ndone at once; and all the young men from nineteen to twenty-one should\r\nbe called out as soon as there are means of training them. They need\r\nnot fight until they are twenty-one. But they are least needed as\r\neconomic assets; they are most needed as military assets; and it is\r\ncruelty to them not to train them in advance.\r\n\r\nThe selective draft was far better than nothing. But let us never\r\nforget that it represented doing imperfectly after the event that which\r\nought to have been done thoroughly long before the event. We have\r\nbeen at war three quarters of a year, and the drafted men, admirable\r\nmaterial though they are, are only just beginning to be trained and\r\nas yet are not even armed and properly clothed. We are trying to train\r\nour soldiers to perform the duties of soldiers after the war has begun;\r\nand we can attempt the experiment at all only because the English and\r\nFrench protect us from our enemies while we make it. Hereafter let us\r\ntrain the man to perform the tasks of a soldier before he is called to\r\nbe a soldier in war. Only thus can we be just both to him and to the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe present economic disturbance in the Nation was inevitable, in view\r\nof our failure at the outset of the Great War to introduce the system\r\nof universal, obligatory military training; and this failure is also\r\nresponsible for the fact that our national army, nine months after our\r\nentry into the war, has only begun training, instead of being already\r\ntrained. Let us now at least provide for the future. The amendment\r\nto the law above outlined, as advocated by the National Association\r\nfor Universal Military Training, of which General Young is president,\r\nwould add nearly two million men to our army, would cause the minimum\r\nof interference with our economic life, and would not necessitate any\r\nadditional expense for training quarters.\r\n\r\nThe men thus trained will be immensely benefited from the standpoint of\r\ntheir success in civil life; for universal training would be of immense\r\neconomic benefit to the Nation. As Cardinal Gibbons has well said, “The\r\nlegislation proposed will benefit youths from nineteen to twenty-one\r\nyears, morally as well as physically, and help to prepare them for\r\ntheir work in peace as well as for the sterner needs of war.”\r\n\r\nThis is the only democratic system. General Young himself rose from\r\nbeing an enlisted man in the ranks to being the lieutenant-general\r\nof the army of the United States. Under universal training let all\r\ncandidates for West Point and all other candidates for commissions be\r\nchosen with absolute fairness from among the men who have served a year\r\nin the field with the colors. And in the navy let all candidates for\r\nAnnapolis be chosen from enlisted men of the navy who have served at\r\nleast a year as such and who are still serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FIFTY-FIFTY WAR ATTITUDE\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 20, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the United States at this moment toward Germany’s three\r\nvassal allies, Austria, Turkey, and Bulgaria, is a fifty-fifty attitude\r\nbetween peace and war. It is not honest war, neither is it honest\r\nneutrality. It is the attitude of the backwoodsman, who, seeing a black\r\nanimal in his pasture at dusk and not knowing whether it was a bear or\r\na calf, fired so as to hit it if it was a bear and miss it if it was a\r\ncalf. Such marksmanship is never happy.\r\n\r\nBulgaria is now simply the tool of Germany and Turkey. I was formerly\r\na stanch champion of Bulgaria, and would be again if she returned to\r\nher senses. But she now serves the devil, and shame be upon us if we do\r\nnot treat her accordingly. No one can doubt that the Bulgarian Legation\r\nis an agency for German spies in this country. The Administration\r\nhas published reports showing that for over a year, previous to our\r\nentry into the war, the German Embassy was the center of the spies and\r\ndynamiters with whom Germany was already waging war against us. These\r\npapers show that Germany’s allies are her mere tools and that Germany\r\nis withheld by no scruple from the commission of every conceivable\r\ntreacherous intrigue and brutal outrage against us. Under these\r\nconditions it is a grave offense against our allies not to declare war\r\non all of Germany’s allies.\r\n\r\nTurkey has been and is the tool of Germany, but Germany has permitted\r\nher on her own account to perpetrate massacres on the Armenian and\r\nSyrian Christians which renders it little short of an infamy now to\r\nremain at peace with her. It is hypocritical to express sympathy with\r\nthe Armenians and appoint messages to be read in the churches about\r\nthem and yet refuse to do the only thing that will permanently help\r\nthem which is to declare war on Turkey.\r\n\r\nWith Austria our present relations are less definable than our\r\nrelations with any other power. No one can truthfully say exactly\r\nwhether our attitude is one of peace or war. We have not declared war\r\non Austria and yet we are furnishing money, coal, and munitions to\r\nItaly in order to enable her to fight Austria. If we really are at\r\npeace with Austria, we are flagrantly violating our duty as a neutral\r\nand we ought to be condemned in any international court. But if we are\r\nreally at war, then we are committing the cardinal crime of hitting\r\nsoft. If we had gone to war with Austria when we broke with Germany and\r\nhad acted with proper energy, the disaster to Cadorna would probably\r\nnot have occurred.\r\n\r\nWe are now taking part in the general council of our allies. The only\r\nway in which to make our part in the war thoroughly effective and our\r\nleadership felt to the utmost is whole-heartedly to throw ourself into\r\nthe war on the side of all our allies and against all their and our\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GERMANIZED SOCIALISTS AND PEACE\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 26, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American Socialist party at the present time is a thoroughly\r\nGermanized annex of the Prussianized militaristic and capitalistic\r\nautocracy of the Hohenzollerns. Honest social reformers have left it.\r\nNo patriotic American ought longer to stay in it. It is purely an aid\r\nto the capitalist and militarist Hohenzollern party of Germany. It\r\nis a bitter enemy of the United States and a traitor to the cause of\r\nliberty throughout the world. Its leaders are the supporters of an\r\nalien autocracy and are seeking to secure a peace which would immensely\r\nbenefit this Prussian autocracy. They stand beside the Bolsheviki,\r\nwhose antics have made Russia at this moment a by-word, both of\r\nderision and hope to every believer in despotism and every opponent of\r\nliberty throughout the world.\r\n\r\nAny man who feels that there is the slightest exaggeration in the above\r\nstatements would do well to read the articles in which the New York\r\nTribune has recently set forth the connection of Mr. William Bayard\r\nHale with the pro-German propaganda in this country, with the Hearst\r\npapers and with the Socialist campaign in New York on behalf of Mr.\r\nHillquit and a peace satisfactory to Germany. These articles should\r\nbe published in permanent form and circulated as a tract among all\r\ndecent Americans who still believe that the Germanized Socialist party\r\nin America to-day is anything except the foe of America, the foe of\r\ndemocratic liberty throughout the world, and the tool and ally of the\r\nautocrats, the capitalists, and the brutal and unscrupulous military\r\nchiefs of the Prussianized Germany of the Hohenzollerns.\r\n\r\nExactly as the reactionary is in the end the worst foe of order;\r\nexactly as the conscienceless and greedy man of wealth is in the end\r\nthe worst foe of property and of honest and duty-performing holders\r\nof property, so the Anarchist and the wild Socialist, whose doctrines\r\nwhen applied necessarily lead to Anarchy and the I.W.W., and the\r\ncrack-brained professional pacifists inevitably themselves are the\r\nworst enemies of freedom, of true democracy, and of righteousness. It\r\nis natural that in this terrible and melancholy world crisis these men\r\nshould have struck hands with the sordid tools of German intrigue in\r\nthis country. The masters of Germany find all these men, whatever their\r\nnominal differences, united in the evil bond of a common subserviency\r\nto German purposes. The German rulers, who at home trample on the\r\nSocialists and dragoon the labor organizations and bully the leader\r\nof democratic thought, cynically profit by aiding in other countries\r\nthe men who in the name of social reform seek to overthrow orderly\r\nliberty and thereby show themselves the sinister allies of tyranny and\r\ndespotism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOBILIZE OUR MAN POWER\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 1, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been announced from Washington that, in view of the shortage of\r\nlabor on the farms, there will be an effort in Congress to permit the\r\nimportation for temporary use on the farms of Chinese coolies. I do not\r\nbelieve the effort will be successful, and if it were successful it\r\nwould be one of the greatest calamities that could befall the American\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nNever under any condition should this Nation look at an immigrant as\r\nprimarily a labor unit. He should always be looked at primarily as a\r\nfuture citizen and the father of other citizens who are to live in\r\nthis land as fellows with our children and our children’s children. Our\r\nimmigration laws, permanent or temporary, should always be constructed\r\nwith this fact in view. No temporary advantages from the importation of\r\nChinese coolies would offset the far-reaching ultimate damage it would\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nNeither ought we to approve the plan, sometimes set forth by zealous\r\nand high-minded men, to get the Government to open up vast tracts of\r\nland and farm it with wage labor. This is a proposal to substitute a\r\nwage-earning agricultural proletariat for a farming population which\r\nowns the land it tills. It is a move in exactly the wrong direction.\r\nWe ought by law to do everything possible to put a stop to the growth\r\nof an absentee landlord class and of huge estates worked by tenant\r\nfarmers. Methods identical with or similar to those advocated by me, in\r\nmy recent book, “The Foes of Our Own Household,” point the way to the\r\nproper permanent solution of the question.\r\n\r\nAs a war measure, rather than adopt either of the proposals above\r\nenumerated, let us deal boldly with the situation created by the\r\nexistence of such vast numbers of men in good physical condition, who\r\nare not being utilized. The best war asset and labor asset in this\r\ncountry is the mass of young men from eighteen to twenty-one. This\r\ndraft law explicitly and unjustifiably excepts this class, although\r\nin the Civil War most of the soldiers entered the army when they were\r\nunder twenty-one. Let us proclaim as our policy that while this war\r\nlasts no man shall be excused from doing the full duty which the\r\nNation finds it necessary to demand from him. Make all the young men\r\nfrom eighteen to twenty-one immediately liable to service, permit no\r\nexceptions for any men, no matter how wealthy, who are not already in\r\nthe army. Use as many of the men thus taken as are necessary to fill\r\nthe camps when the present drafted men of the national army leave them.\r\nUse all the others, and use these men, too, until the camps are ready\r\nfor them, as labor which the Nation shall mobilize for farm work or any\r\nother work which it is imperative to do, and mobilize all the alien\r\nlabor now in the country in similar fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LANSDOWNE LETTER\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 2, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Lansdowne’s proposal is for a peace of defeat for the Allies and\r\nof victory for Germany. Such a peace would leave oppressed peoples\r\nunder the yoke of Austria, Turkey, and Bulgaria. Such a peace would\r\nleave the liberty-loving nations of mankind at the ultimate mercy of\r\nthe triumphant militarism and capitalism of the German autocracy.\r\n\r\nIt merely makes such a peace worse to try to hide the shame of the\r\ndefeat behind the empty pretense of forging a league of nations,\r\nincluding Germany, to secure future peace. Such a peace would mean\r\nthat Germany saw her unspeakable brutality and treachery crowned by\r\nessential triumph and therefore would put a premium upon her repeating\r\nthe brutality and treachery at the earliest convenient moment. It is\r\nmere hypocrisy to promise to put a stop to wrongdoing in the future\r\nunless we are willing to undergo the labor and peril necessary to stop\r\nwrongdoing in the present. In our own country nothing but harm was\r\ndone by the worthy persons who, a couple of years ago, formed a league\r\nto enforce peace in the future, while at the same time they nervously\r\ndeclared that they would have nothing to do with enforcing peace by\r\nstopping international wrong in the present. Lord Lansdowne’s proposal\r\nto hide the admission of present defeat behind the camouflage of\r\npretended international peace agreements for the future is unworthy of\r\nhis distinguished services and reputation.\r\n\r\nOur people ought never to forget that Germany respects nothing but\r\nstrength and the readiness and ability to use it. Germany has made a\r\nfetish of able brutality. She regards with utter derision the pacifists\r\nand pro-Germans in this country. She will use them as her tools and pay\r\nthem when necessary, but if through this aid she was able to conquer\r\nthis country after previously separating us from our allies, she\r\nwould with utter indifference break these tools and throw them on the\r\nscrap-heap with the rest of the American people.\r\n\r\nThere is but one safe course to follow, and that is to fight this war\r\nthrough to victory at no matter what cost. This Nation should declare\r\nwar on Austria, Turkey, and Bulgaria, this week. Let us definitely\r\nannounce that our aims include restoring and indemnifying Belgium,\r\ngiving back Alsace and Lorraine to France, creating a Poland which\r\nshall include all the Poles and a greater Bohemia and a great Jugo-Slav\r\ncommonwealth and restoring Rumanian Hungary to Rumania, and Italian\r\nAustria to Italy, and driving the Turk from Europe and freeing Armenia\r\nand Syria and Arabia. After victory let us join in any arrangement to\r\nincrease the likelihood of future international peace, but let us treat\r\nthis as an addition to, and never as a substitute for, the preparedness\r\nwhich is the only sure guarantee against either war or measureless\r\ndisaster. Therefore let us at once introduce as our permanent national\r\npolicy the system of universal obligatory military training of all our\r\nyoung men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 5, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President has in admirable language set forth the firm resolve\r\nof the American people that the war shall be fought through to the\r\nend until it is crowned by the peace of complete victory. He states\r\nunequivocally that our task is to win the war, that nothing shall turn\r\nus aside from it until it is accomplished, and that every power and\r\nresource we possess will be used to achieve this purpose. He states\r\nthat there shall be no peace until the war is won. He says that this\r\npeace must deliver, not only Belgium and Northern France, but the\r\npeoples of Austria-Hungary, of the Balkan Peninsula, and of Turkey in\r\nEurope and Asia from “the impudent and alien dominion of the Prussian\r\nmilitary and commercial autocracy.” He emphatically states that we have\r\nno purpose to wrong the German people or subject them to oppression,\r\nbut merely to prevent others from being oppressed by them. He states\r\nthat if Germany persists in adherence to her present rulers and their\r\npolicies, it will be impossible, even after the war, to treat her as\r\nother nations are treated, but that, although we intend to right the\r\nwrongs inflicted by Germany on other nations, we have no intention to\r\ninflict similar wrongs on Germany in return. He says that the mind of\r\nthe Russian people has been poisoned by the rulers of Germany, exactly\r\nas the latter have poisoned the minds of their own people.\r\n\r\nTo all of this the heart of the American people will answer a devout\r\namen. The message is a solemn pledge on behalf of this Nation that we\r\nshall use every energy we possess to win the war, and that we shall\r\naccept no peace not based on the complete overthrow of Germany. The\r\nAmerican people must now devote themselves with grim resolution and\r\nwhole-hearted purpose to the effective translation of this pledge into\r\naction, for, of course, the sole value of such a promise lies in the\r\nmanner in which it is actually made good. The people must back the\r\nGovernment in every step to carry into effect this pledge and must\r\ntolerate no failure in any official charged with the duty of carrying\r\nit into effect.\r\n\r\nI shall shortly discuss the proposals of the President in reference to\r\nAustria, Turkey, and Bulgaria. But in this editorial I wish merely,\r\nas one among the countless Americans to whom the honor and welfare\r\nand high ideals of America are dear, to say amen to the President’s\r\nexpressed purpose to wage this war through to the end with all our\r\nstrength and to accept no peace save that of complete victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUR BITES OF A CHERRY\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 7, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his recent message to Congress President Wilson stated that in\r\norder “to push our great war of freedom and justice to its righteous\r\nconclusion we must clear away with a thorough hand all impediments to\r\nsuccess,” and added, “The very embarrassing obstacle that stands in our\r\nway is that we are at war with Germany, but not with her allies.” He\r\nrecommended that we declare war on Austria, and added, “The same logic\r\nwould lead also to a declaration of war against Turkey and Bulgaria.”\r\nBut inferentially and for reasons not apparent he advised against such\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe President is entirely right in stating that our failure hitherto\r\nto declare war on the allies of Germany has been a very embarrassing\r\nobstacle to our success, and he is entirely right in advising a\r\ndeclaration of war against Austria. Incidentally I wish to point out\r\nthat this is precisely what I insisted upon in these columns two\r\nmonths ago, and what I had elsewhere advocated six months ago, and it\r\nis worth while remembering that the Administration papers then assailed\r\nme for urging the course which, although there has not been the\r\nslightest change in the situation, the President now urges.\r\n\r\nThere was no justification whatever for failure to declare war\r\non Austria when we declared war on Germany, and there is now no\r\njustification for failure to declare war on Bulgaria and Turkey when\r\nwe declare war on Austria. There is no use in making four bites of a\r\ncherry. There is no use in going to war a little, but not much. The\r\nPresident has sent a message pledging support to Rumania, but it is\r\nworse than an empty form to send such a message unless we forthwith\r\ndeclare war on Bulgaria. The President has appointed a Sunday for the\r\nspecial expression of sympathy with Armenia, but such expression of\r\nsympathy is utterly meaningless unless we go to war with Turkey. The\r\nAustro-Hungarian and Turkish empires must be broken up if we intend\r\nto make the world even moderately safe for democracy. There must\r\nbe a revived Poland, taking in all the Poles of Austria, Prussia,\r\nand Russia; a greater Bohemia, taking in Moravia and the Slovaks;\r\na great Jugo-Slav commonwealth, including Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia,\r\nand Herzegovina, while the Rumanians in Hungary should become part\r\nof Rumania and the Italians in Austria part of Italy. The Turk must\r\nbe driven from Europe and Christian and Arab freed. Only in this\r\nmanner can we do justice to the subject peoples tyrannized over by\r\nthe Germans, Magyars, and Turks. Only in this way can we remove the\r\nmenace of German aggression, which has become a haunting nightmare\r\nfor all civilizations, especially in the case of small, well-behaved,\r\nliberty-loving peoples.\r\n\r\nBy declaring war on Germany’s allies we do not commit ourselves to\r\nasking anything that is not just for our own allies. But by failing to\r\ndeclare war on Germany’s allies we are ourselves guilty of injustice to\r\nour own allies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RED CROSS CHRISTMAS MEMBERSHIP DRIVE\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 12, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nNext week, the week before Christmas, the Red Cross wishes to add ten\r\nmillion new members to the five million members it already possesses.\r\nLast June the Red Cross War Council asked the people of the United\r\nStates to raise one hundred millions of dollars for Red Cross work, and\r\nthe people responded by raising one hundred and nineteen millions. The\r\npurpose now is to increase threefold its membership.\r\n\r\nThis is the people’s war. All people should, so far as possible, share\r\nthe burden and the glory. The whole fighting manhood of the Nation,\r\nwithout any exception save in the interest of the Nation, should be\r\ntrained to arms and made ready for the front. The Liberty Loans should\r\nbe taken by every one so that the bondholders of the Nation may be\r\nthe people of the Nation, and now this Red Cross membership campaign\r\nis one more Nation-wide effort to bring home to all our people their\r\nobligations to this country and to suffering humanity.\r\n\r\nWe must realize that every single individual in this country is\r\nderelict to his duty unless according to his capacity he does his part\r\nin helping organize for the war. Individual effort alone will not avail\r\nand Germany’s strength has come from her keen realization of this fact.\r\nWe must have an organized Nation, both at the front and at home. There\r\ncan be no organization without discipline, and the Red Cross is one\r\nof the great agencies through which we can make progress toward such\r\nself-discipline.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross does not ask for the new members primarily because of\r\nthe money they bring. The money will do great good, for the need is\r\npressing; but even more important than the money will be the effect if\r\non Christmas morning the Red Cross can flash around the world the news\r\nthat ten million more Americans have joined its ranks and thereby put\r\nthemselves unqualifiedly behind our army and navy.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross has done an extraordinary work abroad and is doing an\r\nextraordinary work at home. Abroad it is in every way supplementing\r\nthe army and navy medical corps in Europe and is accumulating enormous\r\nhospital supplies for the use of our soldiers and sailors. It has sent\r\nover a million dollars in money and stores to Italy. It is giving\r\nboth military and civilian relief in France. It is supplying over\r\nthirty-five hundred French military hospitals and two thousand French\r\ncivil hospitals with surgical dressings, drugs, and supplies. It is\r\nhelping to care for half a million tuberculosis victims and restore\r\na million and a half French refugees to normal life. At home it is\r\nhelping to care for the dependent families of our soldiers and sailors.\r\nIt has organized fifty-seven army and navy base hospitals, over a dozen\r\nof which have already been sent to France. Its useful activities in\r\ndifferent lines are well-nigh innumerable.\r\n\r\nThis is the work the Red Cross has done and is doing for America and\r\nthe world. Now let all Americans in their turn stand by the Red Cross\r\nand help in its Christmas membership drive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEING BRAYED IN A MORTAR\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 18, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson speaks in military matters through his Secretary of\r\nWar. The sole importance of the Secretary of War’s report comes from\r\nits being the official declaration of the President. I discuss it as\r\nsuch.\r\n\r\nAccording to the reports in the New York World, the Secretary of\r\nWar states that “he does not favor universal military training as a\r\npermanent policy.” Mr. Wilson’s secretary, therefore, takes what is in\r\neffect the position of Mr. Bryan, which was picturesquely phrased as\r\nbeing that a million men can at need spring to arms overnight. The\r\nAdministration’s attitude is less picturesquely expressed, but it is\r\nprecisely as futile and as unspeakably mischievous from a standpoint\r\nof permanent national interest. Moreover, it is taken at the very\r\ntime when the disastrous effect of the Administration’s policy of\r\ncomplete unpreparedness is being shown by the admissions of General\r\nCrozier on the first day of the congressional investigation. Mr.\r\nBaker’s report, Mr. Bryan’s theory, and the things already shown by\r\nthe congressional investigation dovetail into one another. They stand\r\nin the relation of cause and effect. The Administration now officially\r\nand complacently announces that the policy which at this very moment\r\nhas proved disastrous is to be persevered in for the future, therefore\r\nassumes complete responsibility for every blunder and delay, and for\r\nall the misconduct, and announces that these blunders and delays and\r\nall this misconduct have taught us nothing, and that we are to amble\r\nonward in the same futile path until disaster overtakes. Mr. Wilson’s\r\nAdministration officially declares that we shall persist in our own\r\nfolly until we are brayed in the mortar of dreadful calamity.\r\n\r\nIf the Administration frankly and manfully acknowledged its evil errors\r\nin the past and championed a policy which would prevent the repetition\r\nof these errors in the future, I would think only of the future and not\r\nof the past, but now it is necessary to emphasize the past in order to\r\navoid disaster in the future.\r\n\r\nWe are in the eleventh month since Germany went to war with us. We have\r\nnot yet built an aeroplane fit to match the speedy battle planes of our\r\nfoes. We have not built a heavy field gun; on the contrary, we have\r\nhad to draw on burdened friends to give us artillery. In the training\r\ncamps of the national army the artillery regiments still have about\r\nten wooden guns for every old field piece, and they have none of the\r\nmodern guns they are to use in the war. There are rifles only for every\r\nthird or fourth man. Until ten months had elapsed there was no target\r\npractice save for a few specially selected units. The troops still\r\nhave only wooden machine guns and the trench mortars they themselves\r\nimprovise.\r\n\r\nUntil ten months had elapsed they lacked even the necessary warm\r\nclothing. They have endured entirely needless suffering and hardship.\r\nOur troops in France have received thousands of coffins, but an\r\ninsufficient number of shoes. At this moment not more than one tenth of\r\nour soldiers, taken altogether, are fit to go to battle. Nine tenths of\r\nour gallant and fine-spirited men are still without the training, arms,\r\nand equipment that would permit them to meet any trained foes. After\r\nten months of war and the expenditure of huge sums of money, we are\r\nstill absolutely unable to defend ourselves and owe our own safety only\r\nto the fleets and armies of our war-worn allies.\r\n\r\nThis condition is due solely and entirely to the policy of\r\nunpreparedness to which the Administration adhered for two and one\r\nhalf years when even the blind ought to have read the lesson of the\r\ngreat war. The Administration now announces that we are not to alter\r\nthis policy and that we are to continue the do-nothing policy of\r\nrefusing to help. If the American people follow the lead thus given\r\nthem, they will be guilty of criminal folly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRENDERING A GREAT PUBLIC SERVICE\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 20, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nSenator Chamberlain has rendered a public service by presenting the\r\nbill to provide universal obligatory military training for all the\r\nyoung men of the Nation. Senator Wadsworth has rendered a public\r\nservice by pushing the senatorial investigation of our lamentable\r\nmilitary unpreparedness. Congressman Medill McCormick has rendered a\r\npublic service by showing that we have heavily burdened our war-worn\r\nally, France, by demanding from her the guns which it was inexcusable\r\nin us not previously to have built.\r\n\r\nThese three services all hang together. Senator Chamberlain’s proposal\r\nis to supplant selective conscription after war has begun by universal\r\nservice, which would probably mean the avoidance of war altogether. It\r\nwas grave misfortune that at the outset of this war we did not call for\r\na million volunteers and at the same time put all the young men between\r\nnineteen and twenty-two into the training camps. There has been some\r\nvery gross favoritism in granting exemption and, moreover, the men\r\nbetween twenty-two and thirty-one include a high percentage of married\r\nmen and of others who ought not to go to war at present. This unwise,\r\nwasteful, and inefficient system should not be patched up. The Nation\r\nsorely needs, both as a war measure and as a permanent policy, the\r\nimmediate introduction of universal military training and service for\r\nall our young men as proposed above.\r\n\r\nSenator Wadsworth and Representative McCormick are in straightforward\r\nfashion showing the inevitable results of the policy of unpreparedness\r\nwhich we have followed for three and a half years, and which the\r\nAdministration, through Secretary Baker, now actually advocates as\r\nour permanent policy. Senator Wadsworth has shown, beyond possibility\r\nof anything except willful misrepresentation, that he has no partisan\r\npurpose whatever and that the investigation is designed solely to\r\nrouse the Government and the public to greater efforts in speeding up\r\nthe war. The Committee on Military Affairs of the Senate is showing\r\nno partisanship. They realize that we cannot win the war merely by\r\nannouncing programmes. They realize that we have a long road to\r\ntravel and that we have made a slow start. They wish to help the\r\nAdministration, and in order to do this it is imperative to tell the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nSome of the fault for the present situation is due to the shortcomings\r\nof individuals during the last ten months, but the major part is due to\r\nour failure as a Nation to embark on the policy of preparedness three\r\nand a half years ago. Nine tenths of wisdom is being wise in time.\r\nNow our people must brace themselves to face unpleasant truths. There\r\nis not the slightest reason for discouragement. If we choose, we can,\r\nthrough our governmental representatives, quickly remedy the defects\r\nand then exert with decisive effect our tremendous latent powers. But\r\nwe need to know the truth and then to act with instant and resolute\r\nefficiency and with single-minded patriotism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA BETRAYAL OF DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 21, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson has announced that we are in this war to make the\r\nworld safe for democracy. Either this declaration was worse than empty\r\nrhetoric or we are in honor bound to make it good. Indeed, to prove\r\nfalse to it now is to be guilty of peculiarly offensive hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nThe only way to make the world safe for democracy is to free the people\r\nover whom Turkey and Austria tyrannize. Every day’s delay in declaring\r\nwar on Austria, Turkey, and Bulgaria has represented and now represents\r\na betrayal of democracy and of our allies. It is hypocritical to send\r\nan encouraging message to Rumania and not to declare war on Bulgaria.\r\nIt is hypocritical to shed crocodile tears over Armenia and not to\r\ndeclare war on Turkey.\r\n\r\nWhen President Wilson says, “We do not wish in any way to rearrange\r\nthe Austria-Hungarian Empire; it is no affair of ours what they do,”\r\nhe is engaged in the betrayal of democracy, and if his present words\r\nare to be taken seriously, then his declaration about making the world\r\nsafe for democracy was false and empty rhetoric. Either one statement\r\nor the other must be unsparingly condemned by all honest men. In view\r\nof the last statement there is small wonder that the Austrian Foreign\r\nMinister says that “it is to our interest to nail down” the statement\r\nin question, because it abandons the proposal, or, as the Austrian\r\nminister phrases it, “the catch phrase,” to allow all small states\r\nto determine their own destinies. No wonder that the leading Vienna\r\npaper contemptuously states that President Wilson wishes to act as an\r\n“European peace intermediary,” being one of the leaders who “apparently\r\nconsider a warlike noise the best overture to a peace conference.”\r\n\r\nThere is also no wonder that the Czech Slovaks feel with intense\r\nbitterness about this betrayal. One of their papers in this country\r\ndescribes how loyally they have supported America and the Allies, and\r\ndescribes the dreadful butcheries and persecutions of their men, women,\r\nand children in Bohemia, and then asks whether it can be true that\r\nAmerica now really proposes to keep them “under the merciless tyranny\r\nof the Huns.”\r\n\r\nThis is precisely what President Wilson proposes when he says that\r\nit is no affair of ours to rearrange the Austrian-Hungarian Empire,\r\nor, in other words, no affair of ours to free the Czechs, Slovaks,\r\nJugo-Slavs, Italians, and Rumanians, who, together with the Poles, make\r\nup the majority of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and who are ground down\r\nby tyranny of the Germans and the Magyars.\r\n\r\nThe President’s proposal represents three separate betrayals.\r\n\r\nIt is the betrayal of the Slavs of Austria, to whose cause our allies\r\nhave pledged themselves and who form a democratic population oppressed\r\nby a militaristic autocracy.\r\n\r\nIt is the betrayal of democracy, because we abandon the majority who\r\nare our friends into the hands of a minority, who despise and hate us.\r\n\r\nIt is the betrayal of the free people everywhere to Germany, for\r\nGermany is now a world menace, chiefly because Austria and Turkey are\r\nher subject allies, and President Wilson’s proposal is to leave them\r\nundisturbed.\r\n\r\nA peace without a change of frontiers and without indemnification for\r\nbrutal wrongdoing, a peace which does not create an independent and\r\nunited Poland and a greater Bohemia and Jugo-Slovak commonwealth, as\r\nwell as a greater Italy and a greater Rumania, and which does not free\r\nand indemnify Belgium, would leave every perilous problem of Europe\r\nunsolved. It would be timid and calamitous folly to refuse to touch the\r\ndisputed questions which, if left unanswered, are absolutely certain to\r\ninvite a future war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBROOMSTICK PREPAREDNESS--A STUDY IN CAUSE AND EFFECT\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 27, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is earnestly to be hoped that the congressional investigation into\r\nthe fruits of our military unpreparedness will keep two objects clearly\r\nin mind. First, the aim must be to speed up the work of efficient war\r\npreparation by doing away with all the present practices that are\r\nwrong. Second, the aim should be to make evident to all our people that\r\nour present shameful shortcomings are due to failure to prepare in\r\nadvance and that never again ought we to allow our governmental leaders\r\nto put us in such a humiliating and unworthy position.\r\n\r\nIt will be quite impossible to get at all the facts of our\r\nunpreparedness. Most officers will be very reluctant to testify to\r\nthe whole truth. They know that they will suffer if they do so,\r\nbecause they have seen the punishment inflicted by the Administration\r\non Major-General Wood for the sole reason that he dared to tell the\r\ntruth about our shortcomings, and dared to advocate preparedness in\r\nadvance. For this reason I am not at liberty to quote the generals,\r\ncolonels, captains, and lieutenants of the artillery, infantry, medical\r\ncorps, and quartermaster corps who have told me of their troubles with\r\nunheated hospitals, insufficient drugs, summer underclothes in winter\r\nweather, lack of overcoats, of shoes, of rifles, of ammunition, of\r\ncannon. But in the camps I visited I saw some things so evident that\r\nno harm can come to any officer from my speaking of them.\r\n\r\nLast fall I saw thousands of men drilling with broomsticks. I have such\r\na broomstick now before me. Last fall I saw thousands of men drilling\r\nwith rudely whittled wooden guns. I have one such before me now. I saw\r\nthem drilling with wooden machine guns as late as the beginning of\r\nDecember. I saw barrels mounted on sticks, on which zealous captains\r\nwere endeavoring to teach their men how to ride a horse. I saw in the\r\nnational army camps in Illinois and Ohio scores of wooden cannon.\r\nDoubtless any man can see them now if he goes there.\r\n\r\nThe excellent officers in the camps are as rapidly as possible\r\nremedying these deficiencies. I hope and believe that by spring they\r\nwill all be remedied. But let our people not forget that for one year\r\nafter Germany went to war with us we were wholly unable to defend\r\nourselves and owed our safety only to the English and French ships and\r\narmies.\r\n\r\nThe cause was our refusal to prepare in advance. President Wilson’s\r\nmessage of December, 1914, in which he ridiculed those who advocated\r\npreparedness, was part of the cause. His presidential campaign on the\r\n“He kept us out of war” issue was part of the cause. We paid the price\r\nlater with broomstick rifles, logwood cannon, soldiers without shoes,\r\nand epidemics of pneumonia in the camps. We are paying the price now.\r\nWe pay the price in the doubled cost of necessary war supplies. We\r\npay the price in shortage of coal and congested transportation. The\r\nrefusal to prepare and the price we now pay because of the refusal\r\nstand in the relation of cause and effect.\r\n\r\nI do not dwell on these facts to blame anybody. I dwell on them in\r\norder to wake our people to the necessity of learning the lesson they\r\nteach. Our next and permanent duty is to introduce the policy of\r\nuniversal obligatory military training for all our young men before\r\nthey are twenty-one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR DUTY FOR THE NEW YEAR\r\n\r\nJANUARY 1, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the papers there recently appeared a brief statement made by an\r\nunnamed young American major to his troops in the trenches in France.\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n We have reached the top in training. If you need anything, come and\r\n tell me and I will get it for you if I can. If I do not get it, I do\r\n not want to hear about it again, for it means that I cannot get it. We\r\n will have three meals a day if we can get them. If we have to miss one\r\n meal, we will not be badly off, and if we miss two or three, it will\r\n not be much worse. We are expected to work from midnight of one day to\r\n midnight of the next day. If there is any chance to sleep between, all\r\n right. It will also be all right if there is no chance. Let everybody\r\n pitch in. While mud and water must be fought, it may be much worse.\r\n The hopes of the Nation are fixed on each man.\r\n\r\nThe ideal of duty thus set before our soldiers, before the Americans\r\nwho at this time risk most and suffer most, is substantially the ideal\r\nof duty toward which all of the rest of us here in America should, in\r\nour turn, likewise strive. We must brace ourselves for effort and for\r\nendurance through a hard and dangerous year. High of heart and with\r\nunfaltering soul, we must do our part in the grim work of toiling and\r\nfighting to bring a little nearer the day when there shall be orderly\r\nliberty throughout the world and when justice and mercy and brotherly\r\nlove shall obtain between man and man and among all the nations of\r\nmankind. We must show our faith by our works. We must prove our truth\r\nby our endeavor. We must scorn the baseness which uses high-sounding\r\nspeech to cloak ignoble action and which seems to betray suffering\r\nright with the Judas kiss of the treacherous peace.\r\n\r\nDuring the year that is opening we at home will suffer discomfort and\r\nprivation and wearing anxiety. What of it? What we at home endure will\r\nbe as nothing compared to that which is faced by the sons and brothers,\r\nby the husbands and fathers at the front, and what the fighting men of\r\nto-day face and bear will be no harder than what was faced and borne by\r\nWashington’s troops at Valley Forge and Trenton and by the soldiers of\r\nGrant and Lee when they wrestled in the Wilderness. We inherit as free\r\nmen this fair and mighty land only because our fathers and forefathers\r\nhad iron in their blood. We can leave our heritage undiminished to\r\nthose who come after us only if we in our turn show a resolute and\r\nrugged manliness in the dark days of trial that have come upon us.\r\n\r\nLet us all individually and collectively do our whole duty with brave\r\nhearts. Let us pay our taxes, subscribe to the government loans, work\r\nat our several tasks with all our strength, support all the agencies\r\nwhich take care of our troops, and accept the stinting in fuel or food\r\nas part of the price we pay. Let our prime care be the welfare and\r\nwarlike efficiency of the men at the front and in the training camps.\r\nLet us hold to sharp account every public servant who in any way comes\r\nshort of his duty in this respect. But let us also insist that the\r\nsoldiers at the front and in the camps treat every shortcoming merely\r\nas an obstacle to be overcome or remedied or offset by their own energy\r\nand courage and resourcefulness. The one absolute essential for our\r\npeople is to insist that this war be seen through at no matter what\r\ncost until it is crowned with the peace of overwhelming victory for the\r\nright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELL THE TRUTH AND SPEED UP THE WAR\r\n\r\nJANUARY 4, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nAny man who at this time leaves undone anything to increase our\r\nfighting efficiency is a foe of America and a friend of Germany. The\r\nman who objects to fearless exposure and criticism of the governmental\r\nshortcomings which must be exposed if they are to be corrected is a\r\nfoe to America and a friend to Germany, and in addition shows that\r\nhe possesses a thoroughly servile mind. The critic whose criticism\r\nis not constructive, or who treats shortcomings as causes for being\r\ndisheartened about the war instead of as an incentive to strive for the\r\ngreater efficiency in waging the war and in preparing for the future,\r\nis a foe to America and a friend to every present or future foe of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nWhen the Administration stands against universal military training and\r\ntalks with vague looseness of future paper guarantees against war,\r\nit renders it imperatively necessary to bring home to our people the\r\ntremendous damage done by our lamentable folly in refusing to prepare\r\nsince August, 1914. It is a betrayal of our country to protest against\r\ntelling the truth for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThis is the twelfth month since Germany in effect declared war on us\r\nand we broke relations with Germany. We have developed our military\r\nstrength so slowly that as yet we would be wholly unable to defend\r\nourselves if we were not protected by the fleets and armies of our\r\nallies. No modern armies can fight without training in modern war\r\nmethods and without modern field guns, auto rifles and airplanes. As\r\nyet we only have either cannon borrowed from the hard-pressed French\r\nor else wooden cannon. We have no auto rifles. Our airplanes are still\r\nunfit to fight modern war planes.\r\n\r\nThe Patriotic Education Society of Washington has done capital\r\nconstructive work in truthfully telling our needs. It has fearlessly\r\nshown our dreadful shortage in shipbuilding and the deceitful wording\r\nof government announcements designed to conceal this shortage. It has\r\nshown the vital need of our, at this late time, bending every energy to\r\nbuilding ships by working three eight-hour shifts a day in order to put\r\nour soldiers and supplies at the front at the earliest possible moment.\r\nThe building of transport ships was the central feature of the problem\r\nwe faced on January 31 a year ago. It was not only a misfortune, but a\r\ncrime, to neglect it, as for nine months afterward it was neglected.\r\nThe newspapers have just printed the statement that Colonel House’s\r\ncommittee reports that it is of the utmost importance to get our troops\r\nquickly to the front. Of course it is. Every man of broad vision has\r\nknown this for a year. If there had been more fearless truth-telling\r\nduring the year there would have been much less governmental delay and\r\ninefficiency.\r\n\r\nTell the truth and speed up the war. Tell the truth only for\r\nconstructive purposes and only with the unalterable determination to\r\nexert every particle of our strength at the earliest possible moment,\r\nso as to win peace by overwhelming victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COST OF UNPREPAREDNESS\r\n\r\nJANUARY 6, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nSenator Chamberlain, in order to minimize the chance of future war and\r\nto insure us against disaster, if in future war should unhappily come,\r\nhas introduced a bill for universal military training of our young\r\nmen under the age of twenty-one. The Administration declares against\r\nuniversal training and therefore for a continuance of the policy of\r\nunpreparedness, the fruits of which we are enjoying. Some of these\r\nfruits are as follows:\r\n\r\nAccording to the statement of Mr. Fitzgerald, the chairman of the\r\nCommittee on Appropriations of the House, Congress appropriated during\r\nthe last year $18,880,000,000 and provided authorization for which\r\ncash must be supplied before next July of $2,510,000,000, making our\r\nyear’s war expenses a grand total of $21,390,000,000. This equals the\r\nentire sum Great Britain expended during the first three years of the\r\nwar. It is over twenty times as great as for any previous year in our\r\nhistory, except the year that saw the close of the Civil War, and it\r\nis seventeen times as great as that. The appropriations for the year\r\nare twenty-two times as great as the total interest-bearing debt of\r\nthe United States one year ago. They come within four billion dollars\r\nof the total expenditures of the United States Government from 1776 to\r\n1917. They equal the expenditure of twenty dollars a minute for every\r\nminute since the birth of Christ.\r\n\r\nHad we started to prepare in time, one half of this cost would\r\nhave been saved. The tremendous pressure coming suddenly caused an\r\nimmense increase in expenditures, even aside from the futile waste,\r\nextravagance, and misdirection. Had we gone into the war when the\r\nLusitania was sunk, we would have saved a third of the sum, for we have\r\nprovided to loan our allies about seven billions. Our delay in going\r\nto war and, above all, delay in preparing, have resulted in a huge\r\nincrease in the money chest and in the length of the war and in the\r\nterrible total of avoidable human suffering.\r\n\r\nThe lack of preparedness is responsible for the sickness among our\r\nsoldiers. Take as an example the ravages of pneumonia in the training\r\ncamps. The men in the training camps are physically of exceptional type\r\nand are in the prime of life. Their death-rate ought not normally to be\r\nmore than a small fraction of that in New York City, where the total\r\npopulation includes the very young, the very old, the weak and sick,\r\nthe badly nurtured. The population of New York City is 4,800,000. The\r\npopulation of the thirty camps is about six hundred thousand. In the\r\ntwo weeks of last December the death-rate in the city from pneumonia\r\nwas one to every 16,500 people. In the camps it was one to 2800.\r\nTherefore, the specially selected men of the camps suffered from a\r\ndeath-rate six times as great as in the heterogeneous city population.\r\nAnd of every three men attacked, one died.\r\n\r\nDoubtless administrative blundering during the last year is largely\r\nresponsible for this showing. But the prime cause is the failure to\r\nprepare in advance. Our first duty at the moment is to speed up the\r\nwar. Our second duty is to secure real preparedness as outlined in\r\nSenator Chamberlain’s bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOÖPERATION AND CONTROL\r\n\r\nJANUARY 8, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThe assumption of control by the Government over the railroads was\r\ncertainly necessary. Exactly how far it will go is not evident.\r\nAt present what has been done is merely to introduce government\r\nsupervision and control over railroads which are required to combine\r\ntheir operations in flat defiance Of the Sherman Law. In other words,\r\nthe Government has wisely abandoned the effort to enforce competition\r\namong the railroads and has introduced the principle of control over\r\ncorporative organizations.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General has just announced that he will, for the time\r\nbeing, abandon the suits under the Sherman Law to break up the\r\nharvester and steel corporations, because it is not wise to do so\r\nduring the war. Mr. Culbertson, the able expert on the government\r\ntariff board, has announced that the Sherman Law is mischievous\r\nin international trade. Mr. Francis Heney, than whom in all the\r\ncountry there is no more determined and efficient enemy of wrongdoing\r\ncorporations, has stated that the Sherman Law, the so-called Anti-Trust\r\nLaw, is mischievous in our domestic business and should be repealed.\r\nIn other words, under the strain of the war the Sherman Law has\r\ncompletely broken down and the Government is not merely conniving at,\r\nbut encouraging, its violation by many different corporations.\r\n\r\nThe Sherman Law, or so-called Anti-Trust Law, is just as mischievous\r\nin peace as in war. It represents an effort to meet a great evil in\r\nthe wrong way. As long as corporations claimed complete immunity from\r\ngovernment control, the first necessity was to establish the right of\r\nthe Government to control them. This right and power of the Government\r\nwas established by the Northern Securities suit, which prevented all\r\nthe railroads of the country from being united under one corporation\r\nwhich defied government control. The suits against the Standard Oil\r\nand Tobacco trusts followed. The Supreme Court decreed that the trusts\r\nhad been guilty of grave misconduct and should be dissolved, but not\r\na particle of good followed their dissolution. It is evident that the\r\nSherman Law, or so-called Anti-Trust Law, in no way meets the evils of\r\nthe industrial world. To try to break up corporations because they are\r\nbig and efficient is either ineffective or mischievous. What is needed\r\nis to exercise government control over them, so as to encourage their\r\nefficiency and prosperity, but to insure that the efficiency is used in\r\nthe public interest and that the prosperity is properly passed around.\r\n\r\nMerely to repeal the Sherman Law without putting anything in its place\r\nwould do harm. It should at once be amended or superseded by a law\r\nwhich would in some shape permit and require the issuing of licenses\r\nby the Federal Government to corporations doing an interstate or\r\ninternational business. Corporations which did not take out such\r\nlicenses or comply with the rules of the Government’s administrative\r\nboard would be subject to the Sherman Law. The others would be under\r\ngovernment control and would be encouraged to coöperate and in every\r\nway to become prosperous and efficient, the Government guaranteeing by\r\nits supervision that the corporations’ prosperity and efficiency were\r\nin the public interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARTEMUS WARD THEORY OF WAR\r\n\r\nJANUARY 17, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great American humorist, Artemus Ward, whose writings gave such\r\ndelight to Abraham Lincoln, once remarked that he was willing to\r\nsacrifice all his wife’s relatives on the altar of the country. Mr.\r\nWard was not in President Lincoln’s Cabinet. Mr. Baker is in President\r\nWilson’s Cabinet. He takes substantially the same ground that Artemus\r\nWard took, although possibly with a more unconscious humor. He has just\r\nuttered a heroic sentiment expressing his pleased acquiescence in the\r\nsacrifice of France and England’s armies for the defense of the common\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday of last week, discussing the likelihood that the Germans,\r\nrelieved from anxiety of Russia, would make a tremendous assault on\r\nthe western front, Mr. Baker said: “The impending German offensive\r\nwill possibly be their greatest assault. The French and British armies\r\ncan be relied upon to withstand the shock.” Mr. Baker is President\r\nWilson’s Secretary of War. He holds at this time the most important\r\noffice in our Government. He thus announces to our allies and the world\r\nthat in the twelfth month after Germany went to war with us, America,\r\nthe richest country of the world with a population of one hundred\r\nmillion people, after being at war nearly a year and after such warning\r\nas never a nation had before, is wholly unable to send any effective\r\nassistance to repel the greatest assault of the war, and that the only\r\nmilitary measure which can be taken is to express through Mr. Baker\r\nthe belief that the British and French armies can be relied upon to do\r\nalone the duty which we ought to share with them.\r\n\r\nThis statement of Mr. Baker absolves us from all necessity of\r\ncommenting on his ingenuous defense of a system of preparedness which\r\nleaves our small army at the front with no artillery except what we\r\nget from the French and our army at home with batteries made out of\r\ntelegraph poles and logwood. It is not necessary to discuss the exact\r\namount of pride we should as a Nation take in the fact that as a Nation\r\nafter eleven months of war we are proudly emerging from the broomstick\r\nrifle stage preparedness into the telegraph pole stage preparedness.\r\nMr. Baker’s statement sums up the situation exactly. We have been at\r\nwar nearly a year, and when the Germans make their greatest assault our\r\npreparedness is only such as to warrant our expressing belief that our\r\nallies can win without our help.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times, a supporter of the Administration, comments\r\ntruthfully on the situation:\r\n\r\n Nine months after entering the war not only are we giving our allies\r\n no effective military aid, but all our bustle and stir doesn’t hide\r\n the fact that, through incompetence and lack of organization and\r\n system, we are far behind in our preparations to supply rifles,\r\n ammunition, machine guns, airships, uniforms, clothing for the troops\r\n we shall some time have at the front. Our backwardness is naturally\r\n disquieting to our allies. If one million American soldiers, or half\r\n that number, fully equipped, had stood on the soil of France, Lloyd\r\n George would have made no speech to British working-men restating\r\n after a fashion the war aims of the Allies. There would have been no\r\n occasion, nor demand for a speech telling the labor unions what the\r\n troops of Britain are fighting for.\r\n\r\nThe pacifists and the agencies of German intrigue would not be working\r\nfor a peace in the interests of the capitalistic and militaristic\r\nautonomy of Germany. As the Times well says, the man who now works for\r\nsuch a peace while Germany is unconquered “is the most heartless of\r\nmilitarists or enemy of the world’s peace and freedom.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRUITS OF WATCHFUL WAITING\r\n\r\nJANUARY 18, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have been at war nearly one year. We have failed to do any damage to\r\nGermany, but we have done a great deal of damage to ourselves. Recently\r\nthe President’s Secretary of War announced that the war was three\r\nthousand miles away and so he had not prepared to meet it. Incidentally\r\nthe feats of the German submarine off Newport in the fall of 1916\r\nshowed that if it had not been for the Allied fleets and armies the war\r\nwould then have been on our own shores. But at the moment it is three\r\nthousand miles away, and yet this Nation is suffering the kind of grave\r\neconomic derangement that we would suffer if a hostile army was on our\r\nown shores. We have accomplished very little. We have suffered very\r\nmuch. Both the failure in accomplishment and the amount of avoidable\r\nsuffering are due to the resolute refusal of our Government to prepare\r\nin advance and to its fatuous persistence in the policy of watchful\r\nwaiting.\r\n\r\nDoubtless part of the present trouble in connection with coal is due\r\nto unwisdom in the price-fixing of bituminous coal. Doubtless part of\r\nit is due to the railway congestion, which in its turn is due to the\r\ncomplete lack of system and consequent chaos due to suddenly imposing\r\non well-meaning, stodgy government officials of average capacity the\r\nduty of dealing in a tremendous hurry with a situation of unprecedented\r\nsize, complexity, and importance, but the temporary causes are all\r\nsecondary to the great cause of complete failure to prepare in advance.\r\n\r\nOur economic unpreparedness is just as complete as our military\r\nunpreparedness and is one of the chief factors therein. We are now\r\npaying bitterly for the fact that two and three years ago it was deemed\r\npolitically wise to shape our governmental policy along the lines of\r\n“Watchful waiting” and “He kept us out of war.”\r\n\r\nIf three years ago we had begun in good faith and earnestly to prepare,\r\nand if, when the Lusitania was sunk, we had acted as precisely as we\r\ndid act with no more provocation in February, last, this war would now\r\nhave been over. An immense amount of bloodshed would have been spared\r\nand the danger of German militarism would have been forever averted. In\r\nsuch case we would have greatly developed the trained administrators\r\nand the coherent system necessary to deal wisely with the economic no\r\nless than the military features of a great war. Our refusal to prepare\r\nin advance and our fatuous acceptance of rhetorical platitudes as a\r\nsubstitute for preparations have resulted in our present military\r\nimpotence and profound and far-reaching economic derangement. The\r\nprofound business distrust, the unrest of labor, the coal famine, the\r\ncongestion of traffic, and the shutting down of industries at the\r\ntime when it is most important that production should be speeded to\r\nthe highest point, all are due primarily to the refusal to face facts\r\nduring the first two years and a half of the World War and the seething\r\nwelter of inefficiency and confusion in which the policy of watchful\r\nwaiting finally plunged us. Nine tenths of wisdom is being wise in\r\ntime. All far-sighted patriots most earnestly hope that this Nation\r\nwill learn the bitter lesson and that never again will we be caught so\r\nshamefully unprepared, spiritually, economically, and from the military\r\nstandpoint as has been the case in the year that is now passing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELL THE TRUTH\r\n\r\nJANUARY 21, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly a year has passed since, on February 3, by formally breaking\r\nrelations with Germany, we reluctantly admitted that she had gone to\r\nwar with us. During that year it has been incessantly insisted that it\r\nwas unpatriotic under any consideration to tell an unpleasant truth or\r\nto point out a governmental shortcoming. The result has not been happy.\r\n\r\nThe famous war correspondent, Mr. Caspar Whitney, has returned from the\r\nfront so that he might avoid our fatuous and sinister censorship, and\r\ntell our people the truth about our army in France. He shows that this\r\narmy, which, Secretary Baker had just assured our people, was admirably\r\nequipped, in reality had no cannon or machine guns except those it had\r\nborrowed from the hard-pressed French; that there was a lamentable\r\nshortage of shoes; that the motor cars were poor; that we had no\r\nairplanes. From another source it appeared that many thousand coffins\r\nhad been sent over. Our troops had no shoes, but they had plenty of\r\ncoffins. Their ammunition was defective, and they had neither cannon\r\nnor auto rifles; but they had plenty of coffins.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the death of gallant Major Gardner from pneumonia\r\ncalled sharp attention to the evil health conditions in most of our\r\nhome training camps, and the Senate investigating committee showed a\r\nreally appalling slackness and inefficiency in the management of the\r\nWar Department under Mr. Baker. There is no particular reason to blame\r\nMr. Baker; he did not appoint himself; he did not seek the office.\r\nLogwood cannon and wooden auto rifles are mostly incidental features of\r\nthe inevitable outcome.\r\n\r\nAll this was done in the face of repeated and explicit warnings from\r\nthe best authority. Major-General Leonard Wood told the military\r\ncommittee of the Senate and of the House in detail about our\r\nshortcomings two years ago, and again one year ago. The Administration\r\nnot only refused to remedy these shortcomings, but has spitefully\r\npunished General Wood ever since.\r\n\r\nCriticism should be both truthful and constructive. I have told not the\r\nwhole truth, but the minimum truth absolutely necessary in order that\r\nwe may, before it is too late, speed up the war, and in order that we\r\nmay insist on the passage of the Chamberlain Bill, so that never again\r\nmay we be caught utterly and shamefully unprepared. Let us insist that\r\nthe truth be told. The truth only harms weaklings. The American people\r\nwish the truth, and can stand the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTIFICATION OF CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM\r\n\r\nJANUARY 28, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nSenator Chamberlain and his excellent committee have already seen the\r\njustification of their investigation. They have forced the appointment\r\nof Mr. Stettinius, a trained and capable expert, as head of the war\r\nsupplies purchasing department. The fact that the appointment is made\r\nin order to obviate the need of following Senator Chamberlain’s more\r\nthoroughgoing programme does not alter the fact that it represents\r\na certain advance and that this advance is primarily due to the\r\ninvestigation by Senator Chamberlain’s committee. It is a striking\r\ntribute to the necessity for and the good results of that investigation.\r\n\r\nThe investigation has been wholly non-partisan. It has been conducted\r\nwith an eye single to the needs of the army and of our country. Senator\r\nChamberlain is a Democrat, just as Secretary Baker is a Democrat. The\r\ncommittee has fearlessly exposed very grave abuses and shortcomings\r\nand has taken constructive action to remedy them. Secretary Baker’s\r\ntestimony shows that, to use the language of Senator Chamberlain, the\r\nPresident has been misled as to the facts. His statements as to the\r\nsatisfactory condition of things in the camps are not in accord with\r\nthe facts. It is, of course, exceedingly difficult to get testimony\r\nfrom army officers because they have vividly before their eyes the\r\nsignal punishment inflicted by the Administration on General Wood\r\nfor fearlessly telling the truth, and those of us who have examined\r\nconditions and know how bad they are cannot give our authorities in\r\nmany cases because we will not expose good officers to punishment in\r\norder to save ourselves from contradiction.\r\n\r\nBut certain vitally important facts are easily attainable. At the very\r\ntime that Secretary Baker was testifying that the army had enough\r\nrifles, the governor of Mississippi in the public press on January 17\r\nstated that he had been helpless to prevent the burning alive of a\r\nnegro because the home guards had no rifles and because “there are over\r\nfive hundred national guardsmen at Camp Jackson, but they are equally\r\nhelpless because they have no rifles.” Many deficiencies can be covered\r\nup or their existence denied, but some cannot thus be concealed. Any\r\none can see the wooden cannon and wooden machine guns in the training\r\ncamps, every one knows that our army at the front has French cannon\r\nand French machine guns. Will not Secretary Baker state frankly when\r\nour own cannon and machine guns will be ready? After one year of war\r\nwe have none. Must we wait another year before getting them? Caspar\r\nWhitney, a responsible man, has stated lamentable shortcomings of our\r\narmy at the front. Will not the Secretary advise us what steps he has\r\ntaken to investigate this statement and remedy the shortcomings?\r\n\r\nThe appointment of Mr. Stettinius is a good thing, but it does\r\nnot represent even a half step toward bringing order out of the\r\nadministrative chaos at Washington. Drastic action is needed to secure\r\na plan providing for coördination, responsibility and efficiency, and\r\nabove all, for securing the right men to administer the plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRETARY BAKER’S GENERAL DENIAL\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 2, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary Baker’s denial of any serious shortcomings in the\r\nadministration of the War Department comes under several heads. Part\r\nof it is prophecy, which we all hope will turn out to be justified.\r\nPart of it is explanation or denials of facts, as to which it is easy\r\nto get first-hand information. With this part I shall deal in my next\r\neditorial. Part of it relates to allegations as to which it is almost\r\nimpossible to get first-hand information except from officers whose\r\nnames cannot be quoted, because this would probably entail punishment\r\nupon them. It is with this part that I now deal.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wood two years ago, before the congressional committee, and\r\nagain one year ago, before the congressional committee, set forth in\r\ndetail our unpreparedness. Every fact he stated has proved to be true\r\nand to be but a small part of the truth. Yet he has been singled out\r\nfor punishment because of thus having told Congress the truth, and this\r\nalthough we and our allies are now paying dearly for our failure to act\r\non the truth which he thus told. Under such conditions it is impossible\r\nto make public the names of the officers and enlisted men through\r\nwhom we occasionally learn of abuses. Nevertheless, it is imperative\r\nto try to correct the abuses. If the Administration had not punished\r\nGeneral Wood for telling the truth, the complaints would be at once\r\nlaid before the department and the wrongs remedied. Under existing\r\nconditions it is imperative to call public attention to them.\r\n\r\nA major-general informed me in October that he had one hundred rifles\r\nfor twenty thousand men, and most strongly felt that these men should\r\nnot have been brought to the camp until the hospitals, barracks,\r\nheating arrangements, clothes, and arms were ready for them. Another\r\nmajor-general told me, in explanation of the shortage of supplies\r\nabroad, that one shipload of big coast defense guns had to be returned\r\nbecause when they reached France it was discovered that there were\r\nno carriages for them. Hundreds of officers and non-commissioned\r\nofficers have told me of lack of overcoats, of winter under-clothing,\r\nof heavy socks. One quartermaster, being unable otherwise to get\r\nwoolen gloves for the men in cold weather, finally got them from the\r\nRed Cross and was officially reprimanded for so doing. Two officers\r\ninformed me that when in France there was a shortage of shoes. They\r\nwere told it was due to a shipment of coffins, one being told that\r\nthey were not regular coffins, but boxes containing grave-clothes.\r\nThe newspaper correspondents repeatedly have told of the shortage of\r\nshoes, one recent statement being that a shipment of clay pigeons,\r\nnot coffins, was sent over, while Mr. Caspar Whitney recites that the\r\nsurplusage was a large shipment of hospital cots. At any rate, the\r\nshortage of shoes is unquestioned, whether their places were taken by\r\ncoffins, clay pigeons, or hospital cots. A leading New York business\r\nman has just written me of the complete lack of hospital and medical\r\nfacilities in one camp. The superintendent of a Bible teachers’\r\ntraining school writes that his son volunteered, leaving a wife and two\r\nlittle children; that his pay was over a month in arrears, and that at\r\nChristmas time he wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n We have not yet received our November pay. At this time of the year\r\n the boys don’t want it for themselves; they want to send some little\r\n thing home to their mothers or wives or sweethearts, and in lots of\r\n cases to their children, to whom just a little something from daddy\r\n means so much. Yet even that little pleasure is denied us. Can you\r\n not bring this to the attention of the people who are supporting this\r\n Government?\r\n\r\nI have received many hundreds such appeals. To give the names of\r\nthe writers would insure their punishment. To pay no heed to their\r\nappeals means that the abuses go unremedied. Doubtless an occasional\r\ninformant is in error in his statement. But Senator Chamberlain’s\r\nspeech and the testimony taken before his committee prove that the\r\nimportant statements I have made during the last few months as to the\r\nshortcomings in our army have been more than warranted by the facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLET GEORGE SPEED UP THE WAR\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 3, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my last editorial I spoke of the things of which Secretary Baker\r\nexplicitly or implicitly denies the existence, in justifying the\r\nAdministration for the military delay and shortcomings that have\r\nmarked our entry into war. But as to the major facts there is no room\r\nfor denial. As to these Secretary Baker falls back on the comfortable\r\ndoctrine that all our shortcomings are of no consequence because\r\nthey are made good anyhow by the efforts of our allies--who, by the\r\nway, with preposterous silliness, are in official circles merely\r\ntermed our associates. Secretary Baker explains that, although our\r\nforces in France have no field artillery or auto rifles, this is of\r\nno consequence because the French love to give us artillery and auto\r\nrifles. He explains that the greatest German offensive movement of the\r\nwar is about to take place, an offensive movement which, if successful,\r\nmeans that we have lost the war, and he adds that we can trust England\r\nand France to repel this offensive. This is a naked statement that we\r\nare to let George do it. We are to announce that after being at war\r\njust a year our delays have been so great that we are almost negligible\r\nin the military sense and that we must trust to our allies to speed up\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nThis verifies the prediction of von Hindenburg and von Tirpitz that\r\nit would take us eighteen months to become a real factor in the war.\r\nAmericans laughed at this statement, but the ruthless and brutal and\r\nintelligent Germans were right and our own soft sentimentalities were\r\ntheir efficient allies. We are in the position of letting George speed\r\nup the war. Are the citizens of a proud and high-spirited Nation to be\r\ncontent with such a position?\r\n\r\nOur major shortcomings can neither be concealed nor denied. In October\r\nI personally saw thousands of infantrymen drilling with sticks. In\r\nDecember, I still saw artillerymen with sticks instead of rifles.\r\nA month ago most of the cannon in the national army camps, which I\r\nsaw, were made of logs or of sections of telegraph poles and all the\r\nmachine guns I saw were wooden dummies. The daily press has repeatedly\r\npublished photos of these wooden rifles, cannon, and machine guns.\r\nSecretary Baker cannot deny this nor can he deny that in modern war\r\nan army without artillery is helpless. We are now getting a small\r\nnumber of machine guns. We are turning some heavy coast guns into field\r\nartillery, but as yet gallant General Pershing and his gallant men in\r\nFrance have to trust to the French for artillery and machine guns and\r\nwar planes, and, thanks to our dawdling and indecision, we have an\r\nutterly insufficient number of cargo ships.\r\n\r\nWe have been at war for a year. In April Congress stated that Germany\r\nhad already committed repeated acts of war against us and that our\r\nown declaration of war was formal. It was then too late to undo the\r\ncriminal mischief caused by our refusal to prepare during the preceding\r\ntwo and a half years, but we aggravated the damage immensely by our\r\ndelays and follies. If we had exercised reasonable energy we would in\r\nsix months have achieved more than we have actually achieved in a year.\r\nThe least we can do now is to speed up the war ourselves. Let us insist\r\nthat this be the end toward which with all our energy we now strive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLET UNCLE SAM GET INTO THE GAME\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 5, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one can tell how long this war will last. It may last three years\r\nmore, and we should prepare accordingly. But it may close this year,\r\nand it is unpardonable of us not to act with such speed as to make our\r\nhelp available in substantial form at once. Uncle Sam must not be put\r\nin the position of the sub, who only gets into the game just before the\r\nwhistle blows. Above all, he must not so act as to rouse suspicion that\r\nthis attitude is due to deliberate shirking on his part.\r\n\r\nThe prime aid in getting Uncle Sam into the game has come from the men\r\nwho, in order to achieve this object, have truthfully set forth the\r\nunpleasant facts about our delay, military inefficiency, and total\r\nunpreparedness. The critics of these men have been either unwise or\r\ninsincere. The most fatuous form of objection to such truth-telling is\r\nthe assertion that it tends to prolong the war. It is the only thing\r\nthat will shorten the war. Suppression of the truth as the habitual\r\ngovernmental policy has been successful in preventing our people from\r\nrealizing our mistakes and even more successful in preventing their\r\nremedy.\r\n\r\nAn excellent example of this policy of falsehood is furnished in a\r\nletter from a news agency offering to various newspapers cartoons\r\nassailing me because I had “criticized our unpreparedness and urged\r\nan immediate movement toward universal obligatory military training,”\r\nthe cartoonist saying that I had said that I had seen artillerymen\r\ndrilling with “wooden guns made from pieces of telegraph poles.” The\r\nwriter admitted this, but stated that “these wooden imitations were as\r\nefficient for the purposes of learning as the real guns.” I suppose\r\nthat this particular Champion of military inefficiency would believe\r\nthat a rifle team could train for a championship match with dummy\r\nrifles of wood.\r\n\r\nEvery important criticism made of our military unpreparedness and\r\ninefficiency during the past six months, and indeed during the\r\npreceding three years, has been proved true and in no case has there\r\nbeen correction of the abuse until it was exposed. General Pershing has\r\njust written home a scathing indictment of the military shortcomings of\r\nour higher officers abroad. This is after we have been at war a year,\r\nand it is directly due to the character of both the civilian and the\r\nmilitary control that has been exercised from the swivel chairs of the\r\nWar Department during this year.\r\n\r\nOur duty is solely to the country and to every official high or low\r\nprecisely to the extent to which he loyally, disinterestedly, and\r\nefficiently serves the country. Let us get behind the United States.\r\nLet us think only of our patriotic duty. I care not a rap for politics\r\nat such a time as this. I supported Senator Chamberlain, my political\r\nand to some extent my personal opponent in the past, because on the\r\ngreat issue now up he served the country. I supported General Crowder,\r\nof whose politics I know nothing and care less, because he served the\r\ncountry. Stand behind America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSERVATION IS IMPORTANT AND PRODUCTION IS MORE IMPORTANT\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 15, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very important that we should conserve many things, but\r\nespecially food. It is, however, very much more important that we shall\r\nproduce the food in order to conserve it. The governmental attitude\r\ntoward production during the past year has been, at points, very\r\nunwise. There has not only been failure to encourage producing the one\r\nthing vitally necessary to this Nation at this time, but there has been\r\nat times, by unwise price-fixing, a direct discouragement of producing.\r\n\r\nWe have suffered severely during this winter because of this attitude\r\nin the matter of coal production. One of the factors in producing the\r\nmisery and discomfort, especially among people of limited means during\r\nthe severe weather of the last few months, was the improperly low price\r\nrate established last summer, and the uncertain and contradictory\r\nattitude of the Government on the question of coal production.\r\n\r\nBut important though all production is, the production of food, the\r\nproduction which we owe to the farmer, is the most important of all.\r\nThis country needs more food. Its allies need more food. Only the\r\nfarmer can give the food. It is nonsense to expect him to produce\r\nit unless he can make his livelihood by so doing. The farmer is\r\nthoroughly patriotic; he stands ready now as he has stood ready in\r\nevery crisis of the Nation, pledged to do his full duty, and a little\r\nmore than his duty. But he makes his livelihood by producing what is\r\nessential to the livelihood of the rest of us. He cannot produce unless\r\nhe makes his livelihood. Not a step should be taken that interferes\r\nwith his welfare, save after such wise and cautious inquiry as to make\r\nus certain that the step is necessary.\r\n\r\nWe should do whatever is necessary to help the farmer produce the\r\nmaximum of food at this time. Moreover, every step we take should be\r\nconditioned upon securing the farmer’s permanent well-being. The city\r\nman is often utterly ignorant of the work and of the needs of the man\r\nwho lives in the open country. The working-man and the business man who\r\ngrowl about one another are a little apt to join in growling about the\r\nfarmer. The city Socialist is more utterly ignorant of the farmer than\r\nany other human being. Last fall the Socialist campaign in New York\r\nhad for one of its battle cries the announcement that they intended to\r\nmake the farmer give them five-cent milk. Apparently the detail that\r\nthe farmer had to feed the cows and take care of them struck them as\r\nunworthy of notice.\r\n\r\nThe farmer must have labor. But there must be no importation of Chinese\r\nor any other cheap labor, whether permanent or temporary. The emergency\r\nneed of farm labor for planting and harvesting can be met at this time\r\njust as the need for the national army was met. The farmer must have\r\nfirst-class prices for his products. No price-fixing at his expense\r\nmust be gone into without the clearest necessity being shown, and above\r\nall there must be no repetition of the folly that marked the dealing\r\nwith the fuel situation last summer. The farmer must have what capital\r\nhe needs at a rate of interest not excessive, in order to plant and\r\nreap his crop this year. The aid can be given to groups of farmers who\r\nunderwrite one another, so to speak, and, of course, if he can be given\r\nit by private means, so much the better. If that is impossible, then\r\nthe Government should act. We should profit by the admirable California\r\nexample to see that the help is given only to the man who is a real\r\nfarmer and can really make use of it, but that it is extended in such a\r\nway as to be of genuine and material benefit.\r\n\r\nThis is the immediate need, and let us treat meeting this need as the\r\nopening wedge of a policy designed to prevent the growth of tenant\r\nfarms at the expense of the farm owner who tills his own soil, and\r\ndesigned also to put a premium upon the permanent prosperity of the\r\nsmall farmer as compared with the big landowner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLE’S WAR\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 26, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not agreeable to keep insisting on the need of doing better\r\nthan we have done. It is not agreeable to keep pointing out our\r\nshortcomings, but to do so is the only way of remedying them and of\r\nsecuring better action in the future.\r\n\r\nThe people, some of them well-meaning, some of them anything but\r\nwell-meaning, who denounce criticism and who object to telling the\r\nminimum of truth necessary to correct our faults, are the efficient\r\nallies of Germany and the foes of the United States. Actual events\r\nhave shown that fatuous complacency on the part of our officials has\r\nresulted in inefficiency and delay which would have meant overwhelming\r\ndisaster to this Nation if we had not been protected by the fleets and\r\narmies of England and France.\r\n\r\nFor the first eleven months of this war the inefficiency at vital\r\npoints in our Government, notably in the matter of shipping and in\r\nthe management of the War Department, was worse than anything Russia\r\nherself has ever seen. Nearly thirteen months have now passed since\r\nGermany went to war with us and we broke relations with Germany and\r\nafterwards timidly and helplessly drifted stern foremost into what we\r\nstyled a “formal” state of war. The Russo-Japanese War likewise began\r\nbefore there was any formal declaration of war. It only lasted sixteen\r\nmonths. We have been accustomed to hold out Russia’s action during that\r\nsixteen months as a miracle of inefficiency, but she showed herself\r\nfar less inefficient than we have shown ourselves during the thirteen\r\nmonths that have just passed, and, of course, there was nothing in her\r\nconduct quite as bad as our criminal folly in utterly failing in any\r\nshape or way to prepare during the two and a half previous years.\r\nThere is just one difference between the two cases. Russia did not\r\nhave England and France to protect her from the effects of her folly.\r\nThat we have been at liberty to indulge in our folly with impunity is\r\ndue only to the fact that England and France have protected us with\r\nthe blood of their bravest, while we have refused to prepare and then\r\ndelayed and blundered and fatuously boasted after the war came on.\r\nEvery pro-German, of course, heartily applauds these blunders and\r\ndelays and bitterly objects to their being pointed out, but every\r\nAmerican with a particle of patriotism in him, every American proud\r\nof his country, should learn the bitter lesson and should resolve\r\nthat never again will we permit our great Nation to be put in such an\r\nignoble position.\r\n\r\nOur worst failure, of course, has been our failure to grapple with\r\nthe shipping problem. But there have been many such failures. One was\r\nthe failure to equip Pershing’s army. I do not believe a more gallant\r\nlittle army than Pershing’s was ever sent abroad, but without abundant\r\nartillery, machine guns, and airplanes a modern army is as helpless as\r\nif its men were armed only with stone-headed axes. Pershing’s army has\r\nonly the field artillery, machine guns, and airplanes that the French\r\nhave given it, and this, although since our troops landed last June,\r\na longer time has elapsed than covered the whole Franco-Prussian War.\r\nAs regards the field artillery, the fault is due to the blind refusal\r\nof the Government to prepare in advance to build the guns. As regards\r\nthe machine guns and auto rifles, the fault is due to our Government’s\r\nrefusal during the last thirteen months to utilize the Lewis gun.\r\n\r\nSteps have been taken to remedy some of the worst of these evils in the\r\nWar Department. They have been taken only and purely because of public\r\ncriticism of them and because of the fearless exposure of inefficiency\r\nof Senator Chamberlain and his colleagues of the Senate investigating\r\ncommittee. Until this committee began its labor, the War Department\r\nhad striven to conceal and had refused to remedy its inefficiency,\r\nblundering, and delay. There has been some improvement, and this\r\nimprovement is due solely to the Senate committee.\r\n\r\nThis is the people’s war. It is not the President’s war any more than\r\nit is Congress’s war. It is America’s war. We are in honor bound in\r\nconducting it to stand by every official who does well and against\r\nevery official who fails to do well. Any other attitude is a servile\r\nattitude. Congress on the whole has done well. Until Congress finally\r\nasserted itself the executive branch of the Government did very badly.\r\nIf Congress follows the lead outlined in the Chamberlain Bill, it\r\nwill continue to do well; if it follows the lead outlined in Senator\r\nOverman’s Bill, it will condone the inefficiency of the past and put a\r\npremium upon inefficiency in the future. Congress must not shirk its\r\nduty to the people. Let the machinery of the Government be modernized\r\nand above all let this machinery be manned by men of distinguished and\r\ndemonstrated ability who will make the governmental conduct efficient\r\ninstead of grossly inefficient, as it was during the first year of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nLet us quit being content with feeble mediocrity. Let us demand really\r\nfirst-class efficiency in both preparation and performance. That is the\r\nonly way to do what we must do and see this war through to a triumphant\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRUITS OF FIFTY-FIFTY LOYALTY\r\n\r\nMARCH 2, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nA captain in the regular army of the United States has just been justly\r\nsentenced to twenty-five years’ imprisonment for trying to combine\r\nloyalty to this country with loyalty to Germany. He was born here of\r\nGerman parents. In Germany, for such an offense, he would have been\r\ninstantly shot or hung. And in Germany organizations and newspapers\r\nresponsible for causing such action would be instantly suppressed and\r\ntheir organizers and editors heavily punished.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate army officer in question is paying the penalty for\r\nheeding such organizations as the German-American Alliance. Mr.\r\nGustavus Ohlinger has put before Congress facts concerning the past\r\nactions and activities of this organization which warrant and require\r\nits instant suppression. Its leaders have sometimes been men who\r\npracticed a fifty-fifty loyalty between this country and Germany and\r\nsometimes men all of whose loyalty was for Germany and all whose enmity\r\nwas for the nationality, ideals, and language of the American people.\r\nIt is an outrage that such an organization should be permitted longer\r\nto exist. Congress should act against it at once and the Department\r\nof Justice should abandon its slack attitude toward German spies and\r\nshould so act as to convince our enemies that Uncle Sam is not a timid\r\nand soft-headed fool, and that hereafter German spies, dynamiters, and\r\nmurderers who ply their trade here will do so at the risk of their\r\nnecks.\r\n\r\nTeaching German in the public schools should be prohibited. German\r\nlanguage newspapers should have a time limit act, after which it\r\nshould not be lawful to publish them save in English. A few of their\r\nnewspapers have a most honorable past and are doing excellent work in\r\nthe present. A number of English language newspapers have preached\r\nmoral treason to the American people, often covering it by zeal in\r\ndenouncing all honest and truthful men who point out the delays and\r\ninefficiencies in government, actions which make those responsible for\r\nthem enemies of the American people and aids to Germany; but moral\r\ntreason in English is at least open, whereas in a foreign language\r\nit is hidden. Moral treason is not necessarily legal treason, but it\r\nmay be as dangerous, and from senators to school teachers, all public\r\nservants who deal in it should promptly be removed from office.\r\n\r\nThe organizations, newspapers, and public servants who thus betray\r\nthe honor of America in the interest of Germany wrong all their fellow\r\ncitizens. But above all they cruelly wrong those loyal Americans,\r\nthe great majority of our citizens who are in whole or in part of\r\nGerman blood. The loyal majority should lend their utmost energies to\r\nsecuring the condign and summary punishment of the disloyal minority\r\nof Americans of German blood who are a disgrace and a menace to this\r\ncountry. Gustavus Ohlinger is an admirable example of the Americans in\r\nwhole or in part of German blood who is an American and nothing else.\r\nAll good Americans, and especially all good Americans of German blood,\r\nshould actively and heartily back him. There is no room in this country\r\nfor fifty-fifty Americanism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUIT TALKING PEACE\r\n\r\nMARCH 5, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThe experience of Trotzky, Lenine, and the other Bolshevist leaders\r\nin their peace negotiations with Germany ought to be illuminating to\r\nour own people. Germany encouraged them to enter peace negotiations,\r\nspoke fairly to them, got them committed to the abandonment of their\r\nallies, used them to demoralize Russia and make it impossible for her\r\nto organize effective resistance, and then threw them over, instantly\r\ninvaded their land, and now holds a part of Russia.\r\n\r\nLet our people take warning and insist that all peace talk cease\r\nforthwith. Germany is the enemy of humanity generally and in a special\r\nsense is the enemy of the United States. She has introduced into\r\nwarfare horrors which not another civilized nation would have dreamed\r\nof using. Her conduct toward Belgium stands out on the high peak of\r\ninfamy. She has murdered innocent women and children wholesale on the\r\nhigh seas and hundreds of Americans have thus been slain. She has\r\norganized murder, rape, robbery, and devastation on a gigantic scale in\r\nevery conquered territory. Our own sons and brothers are at this moment\r\nfacing death by the awful torture of the poison gas because Germany has\r\ninvented methods of warfare more cruel than those of the Dark Ages.\r\nPeace on equal terms with such a foe would mean black shame in the\r\npresent and the certainty of renewed and wholesale war in the future.\r\n\r\nTo talk peace means to puzzle the ignorant and to weaken the will of\r\neven the stout-hearted. It is hailed with evil joy by all the men in\r\nthis country who have opposed war and have wished us to submit tamely\r\nto German brutality. When there comes from Washington an announcement\r\nabout peace terms which the pacifists and pro-Germans are able to\r\ninterpret as favorable to their views, the Hearst papers gleefully\r\nchampion it as undoing the effect of previous declarations that we\r\nare in this war to the end, and Mr. Hillquit, the New York mayoralty\r\ncandidate of the Germanized Socialists and the pacifists, expresses\r\nhis hearty approval and says that the President has now taken his (Mr.\r\nHillquit’s) position.\r\n\r\nLet us quit talking peace with a foe who, if we entered into peace\r\nnegotiations, would, according to his ability, trick us as he has\r\nalready tricked the Bolsheviki of Russia. Let us not put ourselves on\r\nthe moral and intellectual level of Trotzky and Lenine. Every peace\r\nutterance pleases the Germans, renders our allies uneasy, strengthens\r\nthe pacifists, the pro-Germans, and the various seditious elements in\r\nour own country, and bewilders, disheartens, and weakens our honest\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nThe time when words about peace were useful passed a very long time\r\nago. Let us now merely announce that we are in this war to fight until\r\nGermany is beaten to her knees. Then let us bend our entire energy\r\nto building ships and more ships at the greatest possible speed and\r\nputting a couple of million men on the firing line at the earliest\r\npossible moment. That is the effective way to bring a just and lasting\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORST ENEMIES OF CERTAIN LOYAL AMERICANS\r\n\r\nMARCH 10, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThe army and navy of the United States in the training camps, on\r\nthe high seas, and at the battle front, are at this moment proving\r\nthemselves the most potent agencies of Americanism that our country\r\ncontains. All good Americans should feel a peculiar pride in the fine\r\nand gallant loyalty with which the great majority of the Americans of\r\nGerman descent have come forward to do their part to win this war\r\nagainst the brutal and merciless tyranny of the Prussianized Germany\r\nof the Hohenzollerns. As regards able-bodied men, this service must be\r\nrendered in the army, for in war-time no other form of activity can be\r\naccepted as a substitute for the fighting work of the fighting man.\r\n\r\nI continually meet officers from the front. A captain recently out of\r\nthe trenches called on me the other day. His father and mother were\r\nborn in Germany. He himself, after going through a small American\r\ncollege, had spent three years at Heidelberg. He mentioned that\r\none of his lieutenants was born in Norway, and that another was\r\nof Irish parentage, and then continued by saying that already his\r\nbrief experience of the war had given him a horror of the Germany of\r\nto-day, had convinced him that our only safety lay in the complete\r\nAmericanization of all our people and therefore in the insistence\r\nthat English should be the only language of this country and the only\r\nlanguage taught in any primary school, and that he regarded such\r\norganizations as the German-American Alliance as guilty of moral\r\ntreason to America as the worst and most dangerous foes of good\r\nAmericans of German blood, and as richly deserving to be promptly\r\nsuppressed and punished.\r\n\r\nAn officer from our destroyer squadron across the seas informed me that\r\nour destroyers had accounted for nearly a score of submarines; that\r\nabout a quarter of their crews were, as indicated by their names, of\r\nGerman descent, but straight-out Americans and nothing else; that his\r\nown best gun-pointer was named Fritz Heinz; and that their keenest\r\nindignation was reserved for the German officials in Germany and the\r\nGerman-American Alliance in America whose actions tended to make a wall\r\nbetween them and their fellow Americans and who inflicted the most\r\ncruel wrong possible upon them by exciting among other Americans an\r\nindiscriminate distrust and anger toward all men of German origin.\r\n\r\nThese men were absolutely right. We speak in the name of all good\r\nAmericans and on behalf of Fritz and Adolph and Gustav exactly as\r\non behalf of Bill and Harry and Edward, when we demand the prompt\r\nsuppression of the German-American Alliance and of all similar\r\norganizations. The German blood is exactly as good as any other blood,\r\nbut exactly as, under the corroding influence of slavery, masses of\r\nAmericans of the best blood once became the enemies of the Union\r\nand of humanity, so under the debasing and brutalizing influence of\r\nthe _kultur_ of the last fifty years, Germany has become the cruel\r\nand treacherous enemy of the United States and of all the other\r\nliberty-loving nations of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGIRD UP OUR LOINS\r\n\r\nMARCH 16, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bible warns us to gird up our loins if we wish to win a race. Most\r\ncertainly we cannot expect to do well in the present struggle unless\r\nwe bend every energy to the task and exercise all our forethought in\r\ninstant preparation.\r\n\r\nRussia’s betrayal of the Allied cause under the foolish and iniquitous\r\nlead of the Bolsheviki has been a betrayal of the United States and of\r\nthe cause of liberty and democracy and justice throughout the world.\r\nAbove all, it has been a betrayal of Russia herself, and it has, of\r\ncourse, absolved us of every obligation to her. Our duty is to stand\r\nby England and France and Belgium and Serbia, who have stood by us.\r\nRussia has ruined herself in Germany’s interest, and has immensely\r\nincreased the peril for the rest of us. This simply means that we\r\nought to re-double our effort. We should be building the cargo ships\r\nin three eight-hour shift days and should treat work on them as being\r\nequivalent to work in the army. We should speed to the utmost the work\r\non the cannon and flying machines so that our army may cease having to\r\nrely on the French for artillery and airplanes. The army should copy\r\nthe wisdom of the navy in regard to the Lewis auto rifle and should use\r\nthis weapon to the utmost limit now, even although it prove wise later\r\nto supersede it with the Browning weapon.\r\n\r\nWe ought at once to introduce obligatory universal military training\r\nfor our young men between nineteen and twenty-one. They would not\r\nbe sent to war until they were twenty-one. This would be the most\r\neffective step in preparing to get ready an army of five million men.\r\nSuch an army would be relatively no larger than the four hundred\r\nthousand men which gallant Canada, to her eternal honor, has already\r\nraised. Let us begin now to prepare ourselves for a three years’ war.\r\n\r\nIf we had prepared as we ought to have done during the two and a half\r\nyears before we at last reluctantly faced our duty and went to war, we\r\nwould have put a couple of million of fighting men into Europe last\r\nJune. Russia would never have broken, and in all probability the war\r\nwould have ended at once with almost no fighting. There is no use in\r\ncrying over the enormous quantities of milk we have already spilled,\r\nunless it becomes necessary in order to prevent us from continuing\r\nto spill it in the present and future. Failure to prepare as above\r\noutlined may cause us as much trouble in the future as our past failure\r\nto prepare has already caused us. General Pershing’s gallant little\r\narmy has already made the entire United States its debtor. But it is\r\nnot as yet as important a military factor as the army of Belgium or of\r\nPortugal or of Serbia. Let us back it up and equip it and reënforce it\r\nto the utmost of our strength. Let us quit talking peace and bend all\r\nour energies to winning the war, and thereby winning the only kind of\r\npeace that will be safe, honorable, and lasting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLSHEVIKI AT HOME AND ABROAD\r\n\r\nMARCH 19, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThe answer of the Bolsheviki to the President’s message was an example\r\nof mean and studied impertinence. There was no gratitude, no apology\r\nfor their betrayal of America and of the cause of liberty, and no\r\nexpression of hostility to their German masters, but there was a\r\ngratuitous and insulting expression for a class war in America against\r\nwhat the Bolsheviki with ignorant folly speak of as capitalism.\r\nA couple of days afterward the Bolshevist authorities definitely\r\nconcluded with Germany their peace of ignominy and treachery.\r\n\r\nThere is now no possible reason for our Government to draw the sharp\r\ndistinction they have drawn between the Bolsheviki abroad and the\r\nBolsheviki at home. The Government is prosecuting Victor Berger and\r\nhas suppressed the paper of Max Eastman. But Berger and Eastman are\r\nessentially the same as Lenine and Trotzky. All four have played\r\nGermany’s game; all four have been the enemies of the cause of the\r\nUnited States and of liberty. The utter ruin which the Bolsheviki have\r\nbrought on Russia offers an illuminating example of the destruction\r\nwhich would befall the United States if it ever submitted to the\r\nleadership of men like Messrs. Hillquit, Townley, Haywood, and Berger.\r\n\r\nWe have had many evil capitalists in the United States, but on the\r\nwhole the worst capitalists could not do the permanent damage to the\r\nfarmers and working-men in America which these foreign and native\r\nBolsheviki would do if they had the power. Our people should keep\r\nsteadily in mind that the Russian Bolsheviki have not attacked the\r\nbig Russian capitalists who were in alliance with the autocracy of\r\nthe Romanoffs and they have been the tools, paid or unpaid, of the\r\nGerman militarists and capitalists. They have spent their energies\r\nin attacking the revolutionists who overthrew the Romanoffs and\r\nin persecuting the peasants who have become small farmers and the\r\nworking-men who are skilled mechanics and the small shopkeepers. They\r\nhate and envy those thrifty and self-respecting workers who in this\r\ncountry make up the great majority of our people and who are our most\r\ntypical and characteristic Americans.\r\n\r\nThe Bolsheviki have concluded a peace with Germany which includes\r\nhanding back to the Turks, or, in other words, plunging back into\r\nbrutal savagery, a district in Asia in which there are multitudes of\r\nArmenians and other Christians. Our Government has been derelict in\r\nits duty to the Armenians, to the Christians of Syria and to the Jews\r\nof Palestine, by its failure to declare war on Turkey. It is a grave\r\nerror to coddle the Bolsheviki and support them in any way against our\r\nallies unless we are also willing fearlessly to condemn their betrayal\r\nof us and of the Allied cause, and unless we are ready to war to the\r\nend against both Germany and Turkey in order to rescue from tyranny and\r\nto give independence to the unfortunate people whom the Bolsheviki have\r\nabandoned to a cruel fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRUITS OF OUR DELAY\r\n\r\nMARCH 26, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shameful betrayal of the Allies’ cause by the Russian Bolshevists\r\nand the delay and incompetence of the American Government have given\r\nthe Germans a free hand for their drive against the British army.\r\nEngland is at this moment fighting our battles just as much as she\r\nis fighting her own, yet, although three years have passed since the\r\nLusitania was sunk and a year since Congress declared that we had\r\n“formally” entered the war, America is still merely an onlooker.\r\n\r\nWe owe this ignoble position to the folly and the procrastination of\r\nour Government and its inveterate tendency to substitute rhetoric for\r\naction. We have a gallant little army across the ocean, but it is\r\nsmaller than the Belgian army. We are not holding a greater extent of\r\nthe battle front than the army of little Portugal. We have at the front\r\nno airplanes or field artillery and very few machine guns except those\r\nwe have gotten from the French. Even the clothes of our troops are\r\nmainly obtained from the English. Yet we are the richest nation and one\r\nof the most populous nations on the earth.\r\n\r\nOur Government is responsible for our dreadful shortcomings, but\r\nthe responsibility is shared by all the foolish creatures who have\r\nwillfully blinded themselves to these shortcomings and have clamored\r\nagainst the faithful public servants, like Senator Chamberlain, who\r\nlaid bare the shortcomings for the purpose of remedying them. The truly\r\npatriotic men in this crisis have been the men who have fearlessly told\r\nthe truth in order to speed up the war. The other men who have decried\r\nthe truth-telling as “crying over spilt milk” have been profoundly\r\nunpatriotic. It was the failure to point out how much milk had been\r\nspilt which was primarily responsible for the failure to stop further\r\nspilling of milk.\r\n\r\nIn the face of the terrible battle which our English allies are now\r\nwaging, and in view of the fact that for three years and a half we have\r\nowed our safety to the British fleet and to the French spirit typified\r\nby Premier Clemenceau, let the American people now demand that the\r\nGovernment recognize the need of instant and efficient action. Let\r\nour Government quit flirting with the Bolshevists at home and abroad.\r\nLet it declare war on Turkey at once. Let it acknowledge its dreadful\r\nfailures and delays and henceforth act with all possible speed. Let it\r\nmanfully endeavor to make our weight felt in the war this year. Let it\r\nstop boasting about the future and begin to act in the present.\r\n\r\nLet the Government use common sense. It has talked magnificently about\r\nhaving twenty thousand airplanes ready in June, but it has not one\r\nAmerican war plane at the front to-day. Let it quit boasting and act.\r\nLet it push the shipping programme by night and day. Let it give France\r\nand England the men they so sorely need.\r\n\r\nOur Government has delayed until the Allies have been brought to the\r\nbrink of destruction. Let it act at once lest the chance for action\r\npass completely by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE HUN EARNS HIS TITLE\r\n\r\nMARCH 31, 1918\r\n\r\nTHE CURSE OF THE SYSTEM\r\n\r\nBY D. THOMAS CURTIN\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nA scene in Schabatz, when the Austro-Hungarians attempted to flank\r\nBelgrade in early August, 1914, has seared itself into my memory. I\r\nwas in the shambles of an overgrown village. The blood of both armies\r\nflowed in the streets and the wine from broken casks and bottles flowed\r\nin the cellars, soldiers walking in it up to their knees.\r\n\r\nThe street was deserted save for an _Unteroffizier_ who was passing.\r\nAn old woman, bent and shriveled, her white locks escaping the yellow\r\nsash around her head, tottered from a whitewashed mixture of mud and\r\nthatch, saw the enemy soldier, started back, thought better of it, and\r\nsank to her knees while she extended her bony arms for mercy. He drew\r\nhis saber--still a relic of war. “A little despicable stage play and\r\nmagnanimous pardon,” I thought. I was mistaken. The saber whistled and\r\nslashed the outstretched arms, the woman’s shriek cut me like saws and\r\nknives, and I turned away bewildered.\r\n\r\nI came face to face with the man a few minutes later. He was not drunk.\r\nNor did he look like a wild man from the hills. He was a Viennese, the\r\nkind of man I had seen on scores of occasions lolling in a café, mild\r\nand gentle as a kitten. He looked mild and gentle now.\r\n\r\n“Why did you do it?” I had to ask.\r\n\r\n“She was a pig-dog Serb, an enemy of my country. I did my duty.” And he\r\nsaid it in a manner which showed him satisfied in his conscience that\r\nhe had done what was right.\r\n\r\nI realize now that I had had my first war-time example of the German\r\nsystem of education. The code is that anything done in the name of the\r\nFatherland is correct. A man can be educated in such a manner that he\r\nwill wipe out “crawling verminous pests of his country” with as little\r\ncompunction as a farmer would rid his field of potato bugs.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nOn Thanksgiving Day, 1914, I visited the American Hospital in Munich,\r\na military hospital supported by contributions from the United States.\r\nWhile talking with three men in one room I was actually saying to\r\nmyself that such as these could not be guilty of atrocities, when one\r\nof them told me a story which forced me to change my mind.\r\n\r\n“I was a member of a relief company marching in the Vosges,” he said.\r\n“As we were about to halt for lunch, we came upon a French priest in a\r\nwood who was judged quickly to be a spy by our officers. These turned\r\nhim over to us and we had great amusement after we had finished eating.\r\nI laugh still whenever I think of it. We tied a rope around his neck\r\nand threw it over a limb of a tree. Some comrades pulled and up went\r\nthe priest while the rest of us stood around and jabbed him with our\r\nbayonets. ‘Higher, higher!’ we shouted. And then we had a jumping\r\ncontest to see which could thrust his bayonet highest.”\r\n\r\nThe man told me the story because he thought it funny and his eyes\r\ndanced with happy recollections as he told it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO GUNS\r\n\r\n _General Pétain, commander, French army, said: “Send guns; so that\r\n some of us may be alive to fight by your side, when at last America is\r\n ready.”_\r\n\r\n  What! in France and no guns!\r\n  Have I sent forth my sons\r\n  With proud boasts of great deeds--\r\n  And fallen down at plain needs?\r\n  Who proclaimed to the world\r\n  With my banners unfurled\r\n  The dread foe will succumb,\r\n  I, America, come!\r\n\r\n  In France, and no guns!\r\n  And I’ve sent forth my sons\r\n  With those wolves of the Huns at their throats,\r\n  While the Kaiser and Hindenburg gloat,\r\n  And France, stricken France,\r\n  Fills the breach, while my lance\r\n  I sent flaming with pride\r\n  Hangs behind, not beside!\r\n\r\n  In France! and no guns,\r\n  Empty hands, and my sons\r\n  Who would tear out their hearts for my fame,\r\n  Are held up to derision and shame,\r\n  Because statesmen so small\r\n  Hew out roads to a wall\r\n  While the fire bells of death\r\n  Crash souls out, and breath!\r\n\r\n  In France, and no guns!\r\n  Why, you’re worse than the Huns,\r\n  You men who are shaming my honor\r\n  When the stress of the Nation’s upon her.\r\n  With your quibbles and greed\r\n  Can the trampled be freed?\r\n  Oh, my heart’s sick with scorn,\r\n  I, America, suborned.\r\n\r\n  In France, and no guns!\r\n  Let’s forever be done\r\n  With our boasts and our brags, and succumb\r\n  To the scorning before which we’re dumb.\r\n  When at last France is free\r\n  And her glory acclaimed\r\n  Let none look at me,\r\n  At America, shamed.\r\n\r\n  Henrietta Keith, Minneapolis\r\n\r\n\r\nWe live such sheltered lives here, three thousand miles away from the\r\nwar, that most of us don’t even yet realize what Germany has done\r\nand has stood for in this war and what a terrible menace she is to\r\nus and to all civilization. The other day I met a very able writer\r\nand observer who at the outbreak of the Great War spent many months\r\nwith the German and Austrian armies and then lived in Germany until\r\nit became impossible for a self-respecting American longer to stay\r\nthere. He is Mr. D. Thomas Curtin. His father was born in Ireland.\r\nHe is himself a Catholic. I mention these facts merely because they\r\nrefute the cheap and vicious falsehoods so often promulgated by the\r\npro-Germans to the effect that the accounts of the German atrocities\r\nare due to English propaganda.\r\n\r\nI ask all good Americans, whatever their creed, and I especially ask\r\nAmerican women, to read these two straightforward statements by Mr.\r\nCurtin, the account of the killing by torture of the priest who fell\r\ninto the hands of the German soldiers and the account of the fearful\r\nbrutality of an Austrian German to a poor old woman. These were not\r\nisolated cases of brutality. They were both part of the policy of\r\ndeliberate horror, which Mr. Curtin speaks of as “the system.” All\r\nin America who have played the game of Germany, from Hearst and the\r\nGermanized Socialists and the German-American Alliance at one end of\r\nthe line to foolish pacifist preachers at the other end of the line,\r\nhave been, according to their power, working to bring about the day\r\nwhen we here in this country would see our own women and helpless\r\nnon-combatant men and our own children exposed to such hideous wrongs\r\nand torture as is described by Mr. Curtin. I very seriously ask our\r\npeople to read what Mr. Curtin says and to ponder the full meaning of\r\nthe facts he sets forth.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, I ask them to read the poem--and it is a real poem,\r\nnot merely verse--of Mrs. Keith, a Minneapolis woman, called “No Guns.”\r\nWell-meaning, foolish people, and some people who in ordinary relations\r\nof life are not foolish, are fond of telling us not to point out the\r\ndefects in the army, because this encourages Germany, and because\r\nanyhow it is a case of spilt milk, and there is no use of crying over\r\nspilt milk. The answer is twofold. In the first place, Germany knows\r\nall our shortcomings. Inasmuch as we have wickedly refused to go to\r\nwar with Turkey and Bulgaria, we have left open avenues by which it\r\nis absolutely certain that Germany gets full knowledge of everything\r\nshe wishes to know about this country. It is only our own people who\r\nare kept in ignorance. In the next place, as regards the spilt-milk\r\nproposition, the trouble is that we have kept on spilling the milk\r\nand that only by pointing out that it has been spilled is it possible\r\nto solder the milk cans and stop further spilling. Until Senator\r\nChamberlain and his committee boldly and truthfully pointed out the\r\nevil caused by the delays and shortcomings of the War Department, the\r\nAdministration made not the slightest effort to remedy them. Some of\r\nthe more salient of these shortcomings have been remedied, and this\r\nfact is primarily due to the courage and patriotism of these public\r\nservants, Senator Chamberlain and his committee.\r\n\r\nIf fourteen months ago our people had been willing to demand the truth\r\nand to listen to those who told the truth, we would at this moment have\r\nfour times the force we now have in France; and we would have guns and\r\nairplanes, and auto rifles of our own make with it; and we would have\r\nhad plenty of ships to carry our men across and to give them food and\r\nmunitions. The reason why our fighting army at the front in France is\r\nno larger, and the reason why we have had to get the necessary field\r\nguns, airplanes, and auto rifles for that army from the French, is\r\nbecause we, as a people, were not willing to insist upon knowing the\r\ntruth. It is precisely because certain men are now telling the truth\r\nthat there is reason to hope that gradually the milk spilling will be\r\nstopped; that gradually we shall get the guns, the airplanes, and auto\r\nrifles for our men, and above all the ships that are vitally necessary.\r\nI ask the mothers of this country whose sons are now in the army, or\r\nmay go into the army, to read and ponder this poem by a woman, and to\r\ncast the weight of their great influence in favor of demanding that\r\nevery ounce of energy we as a Nation possess be used to speed up the\r\nwar, to relieve our allies of the burden of supplying us with weapons\r\nof war, and to see that the American troops abroad are furnished from\r\nthis country with American-made weapons of the highest type.\r\n\r\nThe don’t-cry-over-spilt-milk appeal represents unpardonable wrong to\r\nAmerica and to civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHANK HEAVEN!\r\n\r\nAPRIL 2, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last, thank Heaven, comes the news that our little American army\r\nat the front has been put absolutely at the disposal of the French\r\nand English military leaders for use of any kind in the gigantic and\r\nterrible battle now being waged. All Americans who are proud of the\r\ngreat name of America will humbly and reverently thank Heaven that at\r\nany rate the army we have at the front is not to remain in the position\r\nof an onlooker, but is to be put into the battle.\r\n\r\nThe wanton and cruel bombardment of Paris, undertaken for no military\r\nreason and with its characteristic slaughter of women and children\r\nin a church, proves that the German barbarity is as deliberate and\r\nas infamous now as at the beginning of the war. The Allies in this\r\nbattle are fighting for humanity and civilization. They are fighting\r\nthe battle of the United States. Any man in the United States who at\r\nthis time directly or indirectly expresses approval of or sympathy with\r\nGermany in this battle or in this war, should be arrested and either\r\nshot, hung, or imprisoned for life, according to the gravity of his\r\noffense.\r\n\r\nThank Heaven that our sons and brothers are now to stand at Armageddon.\r\nThank Heaven that American soldiers are now to fight in the great\r\nbattle against the bestial foe of America and of mankind. Words count\r\nfor little at this time and for nothing whatever except in so far as\r\nthey are of help to the men of deeds who are at the front.\r\n\r\nIt is these men at the front who are now making all Americans, born\r\nand unborn, forever their debtors. They are the men who have paid with\r\ntheir bodies for their soul’s desire. Let no one pity them, whatever\r\ntheir fate, for they have seen the mighty days and have risen level to\r\nthe need of the mighty days. And let no one pity the wives and mothers\r\nand fathers whose husbands and lovers and sons now face death in battle\r\nfor the mightiest of all high causes. Our hearts are wrung with sorrow\r\nand anxiety, but our heads are held aloft with pride. It is a terrible\r\nthing that our loved ones should face the great danger, but it would\r\nbe a far more terrible thing if, whatever the danger, they were not\r\ntreading the hard path of duty and honor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCITIZENS OR SUBJECTS?\r\n\r\nAPRIL 6, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a self-governing country the people are called citizens. Under a\r\ndespotism or autocracy the people are called subjects. This is because\r\nin a free country the people are themselves sovereign, while in a\r\ndespotic country the people are under a sovereign. In the United States\r\nthe people are all citizens, including its President. The rest of them\r\nare fellow citizens of the President. In Germany the people are all\r\nsubjects of the Kaiser. They are not his fellow citizens, they are his\r\nsubjects. This is the essential difference between the United States\r\nand Germany, but the difference would vanish if we now submitted to the\r\nfoolish or traitorous persons who endeavor to make it a crime to tell\r\nthe truth about the Administration when the Administration is guilty\r\nof incompetence or other shortcomings. Such endeavor is itself a crime\r\nagainst the Nation. Those who take such an attitude are guilty of moral\r\ntreason of a kind both abject and dangerous.\r\n\r\nOur loyalty is due entirely to the United States. It is due to the\r\nPresident only and exactly to the degree in which he efficiently serves\r\nthe United States. It is our duty to support him when he serves the\r\nUnited States well. It is our duty to oppose him when he serves it\r\nbadly. This is true about Mr. Wilson now and it has been true about\r\nall our presidents in the past. It is our duty at all times to tell\r\nthe truth about the President and about every one else, save in the\r\ncases where to tell the truth at the moment would benefit the public\r\nenemy. Since this war began, the suppression of the truth by and about\r\nthe Administration has been habitual. In rare cases this has been\r\ndisadvantageous to the enemy. In the vast majority of cases it has\r\nbeen advantageous to the enemy, detrimental to the American people,\r\nand useful to the Administration only from the political, not the\r\npatriotic, standpoint.\r\n\r\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee has just recommended the passage\r\nof a law in which, among many excellent propositions to put down\r\ndisloyalty, there has been adroitly inserted a provision that any\r\none who uses “contemptuous or slurring language about the President”\r\nshall be punished by imprisonment for a long term of years and by a\r\nfine of many thousand dollars. This proposed law is sheer treason to\r\nthe United States. Under its terms Abraham Lincoln would have been\r\nsent to prison for what he repeatedly said of Presidents Polk, Pierce,\r\nand Buchanan. Under its terms President Wilson would be free to speak\r\nof Senator-elect Lenroot as he has spoken, but Senator Lenroot would\r\nnot be free truthfully to answer President Wilson. It is a proposal\r\nto make Americans subjects instead of citizens. It is a proposal to\r\nput the President in the position of the Hohenzollerns and Romanoffs.\r\nGovernment by the people means that the people have the right to do\r\ntheir own thinking and to do their own speaking about their public\r\nservants. They must speak truthfully and they must not be disloyal to\r\nthe country, and it is their highest duty by truthful criticism to make\r\nand keep the public servants loyal to the country.\r\n\r\nAny truthful criticism could and would be held by partisanship to\r\nbe slurring or contemptuous. The Delaware House of Representatives\r\nhas just shown this. It came within one vote of passing a resolution\r\ndemanding that the Department of Justice proceed against me because, in\r\nmy recent speeches in Maine, I “severely criticized the conduct of our\r\nNational Government.” I defy any human being to point out a statement\r\nin that speech which was not true and which was not patriotic, and\r\nyet the decent and patriotic members of the Delaware legislature were\r\nonly able to secure a majority of one against the base and servile\r\npartisanship of those who upheld the resolution.\r\n\r\nI believe the proposed law is unconstitutional. If it is passed,\r\nI shall certainly give the Government the opportunity to test its\r\nconstitutionality. For whenever the need arises I shall in the future\r\nspeak truthfully of the President in praise or in blame, exactly as\r\nI have done in the past. When the President in the past uttered his\r\nstatements about being too proud to fight and wishing peace without\r\nvictory, and considering that we had no special grievance against\r\nGermany, I spoke of him as it was my high duty to speak. Therefore,\r\nI spoke of him truthfully and severely, and I cared nothing whether\r\nor not timid and unpatriotic and short-sighted men said that I spoke\r\nslurringly or contemptuously. In as far as the President in the future\r\nendeavors to wage this war efficiently and to secure the peace of\r\noverwhelming victory, I shall heartily support him. But if he wages it\r\ninefficiently or if he should now champion a peace without victory,\r\nor say that we had no grievance against Germany, I would speak in\r\ncriticism of him precisely as I have spoken in the past. I am an\r\nAmerican and a free man. My loyalty is due to the United States, and\r\ntherefore it is due to the President, the Senators, the Congressmen,\r\nand all other public servants only and to the degree in which they\r\nloyally and efficiently serve the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMEN AND THE WAR\r\n\r\nAPRIL 12, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nA Kansas woman has just written me in part as follows: “I have given\r\nmy all, my two sons, gladly and proudly, as volunteers to my country,\r\nfor they enlisted last August. But my heart grows sick at the confusion\r\nand blunders and apathy. I thank The Star for printing that poem of the\r\nMinnesota mother. It appeals to all of us mothers who stay at home and\r\npray and work as we can.”\r\n\r\nI think more continually of such mothers of soldiers as this Kansas\r\nwoman, than I do even of the soldiers themselves. They have high and\r\ngallant souls. They are the spiritual heirs of the mothers and wives of\r\nWashington’s Continentals and of the mothers and wives of the soldiers\r\nof Grant and Lee. I am proud beyond measure that I am their fellow\r\ncountryman. In everything that I do or say, I seek to make and to\r\nkeep this land a land in which their daughters can dwell in honorable\r\nsafety and to make our common citizenship such that both their sons and\r\ndaughters shall hold their heads high because they are Americans.\r\n\r\nBut exactly as I revere such women, so I condemn the women whose\r\nshort-sightedness or frivolous love of ease and vapid pleasure or whose\r\ntimid fear of danger and labor makes them fit companions for those\r\nunworthy men whose lives represent merely the shirking of duty. The\r\nmother who, by perpetual complaint and lamentation about unavoidable\r\nhardships and risks, seeks to weaken the heart of her soldier son\r\nstands no higher than the money-getting or ease-loving man who dodges\r\nthe draft. The woman who cares so little for the honor of America and\r\nthe interests of civilization as now to wish a peace without victory\r\nis no better than the men in uniform who seek soft positions of safety\r\namong the slickers and slackers.\r\n\r\nThe things that are best worth having in life must be paid for whether\r\nby forethought or by toil or by downright facing of danger. This is\r\ntrue in peace. It is even more true in war. It is just as true of women\r\nas of men.\r\n\r\nAll wise and good women and all wise and good men abhor war. Washington\r\nand Lincoln abhorred war. But no man or woman is either wise or good\r\nunless he or she abhors some things even more than war, exactly as\r\nWashington and Lincoln abhorred them. We are none of us fit to be free\r\nmen in a republic if we are not willing to fight when the Republic is\r\nwronged as Germany has wronged this country. We are none of us entitled\r\nto say that we love mankind if we are not willing to do battle against\r\nthe Turk and the German in order to right such wrongs as have been\r\nperpetrated on Belgium and Armenia. And we deserve to be brayed in a\r\nmortar if we are ever again guilty of such folly as that of which we\r\nhave been guilty by our foolish failure to prepare our strength in\r\nefficient fashion during the last three and a half years.\r\n\r\nThe women of this country who love their husbands and sons should\r\nrealize now that only by thorough preparedness in advance can war be\r\navoided, if possible, or successfully waged if it has to come. Recently\r\nmen in high position whose own bodies are safe have stated that they\r\nare glad that we were not prepared in advance to do our duty when this\r\nwar came. These men have purchased their own safety and advantage by\r\nthe blood of our sons at the front. Let the women who do not wish to\r\nsee their men go up against the cannon see that hereafter all our sons\r\nare well trained in advance. If America’s strength is fully prepared in\r\nadvance, she will in all probability never have to go to war and will\r\nbe a potent factor in preserving the peace of justice throughout the\r\nworld, and the first step in securing such a peace is to devote all\r\nour energies to speeding up the war until it is ended by the complete\r\ntriumph of our allies and ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MY FELLOW AMERICANS OF GERMAN BLOOD\r\n\r\nAPRIL 16, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nHermann Hagedorn, an American whose father and mother were born in\r\nGermany, an American of the best and bravest and most loyal type,\r\nhas just written a little book called “Where Do You Stand? An Appeal\r\nto Americans of German Origin.” I wish it could be read by every\r\nindividual of those to whom it is addressed, and by all other Americans\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nI am, myself, partly of German blood, and I make my appeal as an\r\nAmerican does, to and on behalf of all other Americans who have German\r\nblood in their veins. We have room in this country only for Americans\r\nwho are Americans, and nothing else. They must be loyal to only one\r\nflag; they must speak one language; they must serve only American\r\nideals. I mean literally what I say, that every man who bears even\r\nthe smallest allegiance to any other country should be sent out of\r\nthis country. The native American who, during this war, directly or\r\nindirectly, assails any of our allies, notably England, but also\r\nJapan, is a traitor to America and should be promptly imprisoned. The\r\nGerman-American, and especially the German-American editor, guilty\r\nof such conduct or of any exaltation of any German victory should be\r\ninstantly interned and then sent back to Germany. The Sinn Feiner who\r\nattacks England should be immediately interned and then sent back to\r\nIreland. The German-American Alliance and all similar organizations\r\nshould immediately be broken up by Congress and by the state\r\nlegislatures. Our people would do well to remember that even when such\r\norganizations keep quiet for the moment, they are certain to revive and\r\nto work against America with the utmost malignity when peace comes.\r\nThe time to crush them is now. Foreign language newspapers should be\r\nrequired to follow the example of the New York Herald and begin the\r\nchange, which is to convert their newspapers into English, the language\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nAs for spies, preachers of sedition, men who practice sabotage, and all\r\nother such persons, the Government already has much power, but should\r\nbe given any needed additional power to proceed against them, and this\r\npower should be used in drastic fashion, if necessary under martial\r\nlaw, and after a summary trial the guilty men should be shot.\r\n\r\nSo much for the men of German blood, or of any other blood, who are\r\nnot good Americans; but remember that it is also our highest duty from\r\nthe standpoint of Americanism to stand by the good American of German\r\nblood, just exactly as we stand by any other American. We must refuse\r\nto permit any division along the lines of blood or ancestry. We must\r\ndemand whole-hearted Americanism, and if a man gives this, we must\r\ntreat him exactly on his merits, like any other American. In other\r\nwords, we must give every man a square deal. Shoot the spy or the\r\ntraitor, whether of native American, Irish, or German blood; whether a\r\nProtestant, Catholic, or Jew. Stand by the good American of any creed,\r\nno matter where he was born or whence his parents came.\r\n\r\nIt is an outrage to discriminate against a good American in civil life\r\nbecause he is of German blood. It is an even worse outrage for the\r\nGovernment to permit such discrimination against him in the army or in\r\nany of the organizations working under government supervision. Let us\r\ninsist on the immediate stopping of such discriminations, which cruelly\r\nwound good Americans and tend to drive them back into the ranks of\r\nthe half-loyal. In return let good Americans of German blood band\r\ntogether and take the lead in organization action against all disloyal\r\nor half-loyal citizens of German blood and against all German language\r\nor English language newspapers which are not whole-heartedly loyal and\r\nagainst all such organizations as the German-American Alliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EXTRAORDINARY ACHIEVEMENT IN HUMAN UPBUILDING\r\n\r\nAPRIL 17, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor E. C. Simmons, of St. Louis, the manager of the Southwestern\r\nDivision of the American Red Cross, has just returned from our army\r\nin France. He relates a really extraordinary achievement of the\r\ndivision of orthopædic surgery with the army under the direction of\r\nSurgeon-Major Joel E. Goldthwaite.\r\n\r\nAll the divisions of troops sent across, of course, contain a number\r\nof men who show physical shortcomings under the strain of actual\r\ncampaigning. In General Edwards’s division these men numbered in the\r\nneighborhood of fifteen per cent, not an unusual proportion in the\r\nhistory of past wars. Dr. Goldthwaite got permission to try his hand on\r\nthe treatment of a body composed of somewhat over five hundred of them,\r\nand instantly began vigorous but careful work to build up all their\r\nphysical defects.\r\n\r\nAs his work for each man was finished, he was put in one of four\r\nclasses. Class A included those to whom the training gave such vigor\r\nthat they were fit to go right to the front as battle units. Class B\r\nincluded those who could be made fit for hard physical labor back of\r\nthe front, although not for the tremendous strain of the trenches.\r\nClass C included those fitted for clerical and similar duties. Class D\r\nincluded those whose physical condition would not be improved and who\r\nhad to be sent home.\r\n\r\nDr. Goldthwaite was able to place over eighty per cent of the men\r\nin Class A, and all the remainder in either Class B or Class C. Not\r\na man had to be sent home. Remember that the physical shortcomings\r\nof these men were all present before they entered the army and were\r\nnot acquired in the army. The work done for them made them not only\r\nfit to be soldiers, but fit to be citizens. Moreover, it affected\r\nthem morally exactly as much as physically. They had become utterly\r\ndispirited and downcast. After Dr. Goldthwaite was through with them,\r\nthey were all self-reliant, energetic Americans, vigorous, upstanding,\r\nand self-respecting, having lost all trace of either moral or physical\r\ncrooked back and stooping shoulders.\r\n\r\nWhen we get universal obligatory military training for all our young\r\nmen, this is what will happen everywhere and the benefit to our people\r\nwill be incalculable. Such training will minimize the chance of our\r\never having to go to war and will render it certain that hereafter we\r\nshall always be able to defend ourselves instead of trusting to our\r\nallies to defend us. Moreover, it will do us even more good as regards\r\nthe tasks of peace than as regards the tasks of war, for it will turn\r\nout every young man far better able to earn his living and far better\r\nfitted to be a good citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEDOM STANDS WITH HER BACK TO THE WALL\r\n\r\nAPRIL 20, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a terrible hour of trial and suffering and danger for our\r\nwar-worn allies, who in France are battling for us no less than for\r\nthemselves. If shame is even more dreadful than suffering, then it is\r\na no less terrible hour for our own country. Our allies stand with\r\ntheir backs to the wall in the fight for freedom, and America looks\r\non. The free nations stand at bay in the cause that is ours no less\r\nthan theirs; and after over a year of war the army we have sent to\r\ntheir aid is smaller than that of poor heroic, ruined Belgium, is\r\nhardly more than a twentieth the size which gallant and impoverished\r\nItaly has in the field. And this great wealthy Nation of ours has\r\nnot yet furnished to our own brave troops in the field any cannon\r\nor airplanes, and almost no machine guns, save those which we have\r\nobtained from hard-pressed France--and let our people remember that\r\nevery gun thus made for us by hard-pressed France is a gun left unmade\r\nfor hard-pressed Italy.\r\n\r\nOur few gallant fighting men overseas have won high honor for\r\nthemselves, and have made all other Americans forever their debtors;\r\nbut it is a scandal and a reproach to this Nation that they are so\r\nfew. If in this mighty battle our allies win, it will be due to no\r\nreal aid of ours; and if they should fail, black infamy would be our\r\nportion because of the delay and the folly and the weakness and the\r\ncold, time-serving timidity of our Government, to which this failure\r\nwould be primarily due. If those responsible for our failure, if those\r\nresponsible for the refusal to prepare during the two and a half years\r\nin which we were vouchsafed such warning as never nation previously\r\nreceived, if those responsible for the sluggish feebleness with which\r\nwe have acted since we helplessly drifted into the war--if these men\r\nnow repented of the cruel wrong they have done this Nation and mankind,\r\nwe could afford to wrap their past folly and evil-doing in the kindly\r\nmantle of oblivion. But they boast of their foolishness, they excuse\r\nand justify it, they announce that they feel pride and delight in\r\ncontemplating it. Therefore, it is for us, the people, to bow our heads\r\non this our penitential day; for we are laggards in the battle, we have\r\nlet others fight in our quarrel, we have let others pay with their\r\nshattered bodies for the fire in their burning souls.\r\n\r\nThe trumpets of the Lord sounded for Armageddon; but our hearts were\r\nnot swift to answer nor our feet jubilant; coldly we watched others die\r\nthat we might live. Our rulers were supple and adroit, but they were\r\nnot mighty of soul. They have shown that they will not lead us, and\r\nwill ever stand in front only if we force them forward. Therefore, the\r\nreason is all the greater why we, the American people, must search our\r\nown hearts and with unflinching will insist that from now on not a day,\r\nnot an hour, shall be wasted until our giant but soft and lazy strength\r\nis hardened, until we ourselves take the burden from the shoulders of\r\nothers, until we pay whatever price our past shortcomings demand, and\r\nwith heads uplifted and spirit undaunted stride forward to the great\r\ngoal of the peace of victorious right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SQUARE DEAL FOR ALL AMERICANS\r\n\r\nAPRIL 27, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no room in this country for the man who tries to be both\r\nan American and something else. There can be no such thing as a\r\nfifty-fifty loyalty between America and Germany. Either a man is\r\nwhole-hearted in his support of America and her allies, and in his\r\nhostility to Germany and her allies, or he is not loyal to America at\r\nall. In such case he should be at once interned or sent out of the\r\ncountry. But if he is whole-hearted in his loyal support of America,\r\nthen no matter what his birthplace or parentage he is entitled to stand\r\non a full and exact equality with every other American.\r\n\r\nTherefore the obligation is twofold, and one side is just as important\r\nas the other. Every American of German birth or parentage must act\r\nas an American and nothing else, and if he does not so act he should\r\nbe treated as an alien enemy. But if he acts exactly as other good\r\nAmericans act, then it is a shame and a disgrace not to treat him\r\nabsolutely like these other good Americans. The immense majority of\r\nAmericans who are in whole or in part of German blood are as stanch\r\nAmericans as are to be found in the land. They are serving in our\r\narmies precisely as other Americans serve. They are exactly as fit as\r\nany other American to fill the highest positions anywhere in our armies\r\nor in civil life. Any discrimination against them, active or passive,\r\nmilitary or political, social or industrial, is an intolerable outrage.\r\nMoreover, such a discrimination is itself profoundly anti-American in\r\nits effects, for it not only cruelly wounds brave and upright and loyal\r\nAmericans, but tends to drive them back into segregation, away from the\r\nmass of American citizenship.\r\n\r\nAmerica is a Nation and not a mosaic of nationalities. The various\r\nnationalities that come here are not to remain separate, but to blend\r\ninto the one American nationality--the nationality of Washington and\r\nLincoln, of Muhlenberg and Sheridan. Therefore, we must have but one\r\nlanguage, the English language. Every immigrant who comes here should\r\nbe required within five years to learn English or to leave the country,\r\nfor hereafter every immigrant should be treated as a future fellow\r\ncitizen and not merely as a labor unit. English should be the only\r\nlanguage taught or used in the primary schools. We should provide by\r\nlaw so that after a reasonable interval every newspaper in this country\r\nshould be published in English.\r\n\r\nA square deal for all Americans means relentless attack on all men\r\nin this country who are not straight-out Americans and nothing else.\r\nIt just as emphatically means to stand by every good American of\r\nGerman blood exactly as much as by every other good American. In\r\nevery loyalty organization a special effort should be made to see\r\nthat in the leadership and in the ranks the Americans of German\r\nblood come in on precisely the same basis as every one else. And the\r\nstraight-out Americans, in whole or in part of German blood, should\r\nthemselves insist on this, not as a favor which they request, but\r\nas a right which they demand, a right predicated on their fervid\r\nand militant Americanism. I wish we could see such an organization\r\nformed, an uncompromisingly straight-out American organization,\r\nincluding Americans of all our different blood strains, but with as\r\nlarge a proportion of Americans in whole or in part of German blood as\r\npossible, and then let this organization take the lead in aggressively\r\nloyal Americanism, in the demand to fight this war with all speed\r\nand efficiency, until it is crowned by the peace of complete victory\r\nand in the purpose to make this peace mark the glorious rebirth, the\r\npurification and the giant growth of the American spirit--the spirit of\r\nan intense and unified American nationalism.\r\n\r\nWe Americans must be loyal first to our own Nation and to our own\r\nnational ideals, and we must develop to the utmost the virile hardihood\r\nof body, mind, and soul without which there can be no real greatness.\r\nAnd our devotion to America shall in part show itself in the unswerving\r\neffort to make this great democratic Republic both strong for\r\nself-defense and strong for wise and brotherly help to other nations,\r\nto make it both the leader and the servant of all mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GERMAN HORROR\r\n\r\nMAY 2, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hague conferences laid down a number of rules which the signatory\r\npowers, including Germany, agreed to observe in order to mitigate the\r\nhorrors of war. Germany has with equal cynicism and brutality violated\r\nevery one of these rules. She has waged war as it was waged in the Dark\r\nAges. She has shown revolting cruelty toward soldiers and especially\r\ntoward non-combatants, including women and children.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a great cannon is bombarding Paris. Not a soldier\r\nhas been killed by it; it has not in the smallest degree affected\r\nFrance’s military power, nor was it intended to do so. It was intended\r\nto terrorize the French civilian population by the destruction of\r\nchurches, hospitals, and private buildings and the murder of women and\r\nchildren. On Good Friday one of the shells wrecked a church and killed\r\na number of the little choir boys and a number of women who were at\r\nprayer. Among the killed were three American women whom I knew, who\r\nwere abroad working for our soldiers. An American friend who saw the\r\nhorror writes me:\r\n\r\n Evidently the Germans do not worry over the fact that their shells\r\n descend on women and children kneeling in prayer on a Good Friday,\r\n before the crucifix.\r\n\r\nAnother American friend, a Red Cross woman, writes:\r\n\r\n One shell burst in a maternity hospital, killing a nurse, a young\r\n mother, and a little baby. Several other mothers and new-born babies\r\n were injured.\r\n\r\nThe Zeppelins and airplanes are continually bombarding undefended\r\nEnglish and French cities and have killed women and children by the\r\nhundreds. The submarines have waged war with callous mercilessness.\r\nTheir crews have continually practiced torture on the prisoners they\r\nhave taken. They leave women and children to drown. They shoot into the\r\nlifeboats. At this moment Americans are dying from the poison gas which\r\nthe Germans, in contemptuous defiance of The Hague rules, have made\r\nan ordinary weapon of war. I have just been talking with an American\r\nsoldier absolutely trustworthy, who himself saw the body of a Canadian\r\nwhom the Germans had just crucified.\r\n\r\nEvery violation of the laws of war has been practiced by Germany. By\r\nher outrages on humanity she has made herself an outlaw among nations,\r\nand unless she pays heavily for her crimes, the whole world will be\r\nin danger. It is Germany, and only Germany, who is responsible for\r\nthe hideous atrocities that have marked this war, atrocities which\r\nall civilized men outside of Germany believed to have been eliminated\r\nforever from civilized warfare. Germany has habitually and as a matter\r\nof policy practiced the torture of men, the rape of women, and the\r\nkilling of children.\r\n\r\nIt was deeply to our discredit that during the shameful years of our\r\nneutrality we refused to protest against these hideous atrocities. Now\r\nat last this Nation has awakened and has gone to war against the enemy\r\nof America and of mankind. Let our people now keep steadily in mind\r\njust what kind of a foe we are fighting and just what kind of infamy\r\nthat foe is habitually practicing. Then let us resolve that, come what\r\nmay, we will fight this war through to a finish until the authors of\r\nthis hideous infamy have paid in full and have been punished as they\r\ndeserve. For in no other way can a peace worth having be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEDITION, A FREE PRESS, AND PERSONAL RULE\r\n\r\nMAY 7, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThe legislation now being enacted by Congress should deal drastically\r\nwith sedition. It should also guarantee the right of the press and\r\npeople to speak the truth freely of all their public servants,\r\nincluding the President, and to criticize them in the severest terms of\r\ntruth whenever they come short in their public duty. Finally, Congress\r\nshould grant the Executive the amplest powers to act as an executive\r\nand should hold him to stern accountability for failure so to act, but\r\nit should itself do the actual lawmaking and should clearly define the\r\nlines and limits of action and should retain and use the fullest powers\r\nof investigation into and supervision over such action. Sedition is a\r\nform of treason. It is an offense against the country, not against the\r\nPresident. At this time to oppose the draft or sending our armies to\r\nEurope, to uphold Germany, to attack our allies, to oppose raising the\r\nmoney necessary to carry on the war are at least forms of sedition,\r\nwhile to act as a German spy or to encourage German spies to use\r\nmoney or intrigue in the corrupt service of Germany, to tamper with\r\nour war manufactures and to encourage our soldiers to desert or to\r\nfail in their duty, and all similar actions are forms of undoubtedly\r\nillegal sedition. For some of these offenses death should be summarily\r\ninflicted. For all the punishment should be severe.\r\n\r\nThe Administration has been gravely remiss in dealing with such acts.\r\n\r\nFree speech, exercised both individually and through a free press, is\r\na necessity in any country where the people are themselves free. Our\r\nGovernment is the servant of the people, whereas in Germany it is the\r\nmaster of the people. This is because the American people are free and\r\nthe German are not free. The President is merely the most important\r\namong a large number of public servants. He should be supported or\r\nopposed exactly to the degree which is warranted by his good conduct\r\nor bad conduct, his efficiency or inefficiency in rendering loyal,\r\nable, and disinterested service to the Nation as a whole. Therefore\r\nit is absolutely necessary that there should be full liberty to tell\r\nthe truth about his acts, and this means that it is exactly necessary\r\nto blame him when he does wrong as to praise him when he does right.\r\nAny other attitude in an American citizen is both base and servile. To\r\nannounce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we\r\nare to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic\r\nand servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public. Nothing\r\nbut the truth should be spoken about him or any one else. But it is\r\neven more important to tell the truth, pleasant or unpleasant, about\r\nhim than about any one else.\r\n\r\nDuring the last year the Administration has shown itself anxious to\r\npunish the newspapers which uphold the war, but which told the truth\r\nabout the Administration’s failure to conduct the war efficiently,\r\nwhereas it has failed to proceed against various powerful newspapers\r\nwhich opposed the war or attacked our allies or directly or indirectly\r\naided Germany against this country, as these papers upheld the\r\nAdministration and defended the inefficiency. Therefore, no additional\r\npower should be given the Administration to deal with papers for\r\ncriticizing the Administration. And, moreover, Congress should closely\r\nscrutinize the way the Postmaster-General and Attorney-General have\r\nalready exercised discrimination between the papers they prosecuted and\r\nthe papers they failed to prosecute.\r\n\r\nCongress should give the President full power for efficient executive\r\naction. It should not abrogate its own power. It should define how he\r\nis to reorganize the Administration. It should say how large an army we\r\nare to have and not leave the decision to the amiable Secretary of War,\r\nwho has for two years shown such inefficiency. It should declare for an\r\narmy of five million men and inform the Secretary that it would give\r\nhim more the minute he asks for more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DANGERS OF A PREMATURE PEACE\r\n\r\nMAY 12, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nAs now seems likely, if the great German drive fails, it is at least\r\npossible that, directly or indirectly, the Germans will then start a\r\npeace drive. In such case they will probably endeavor to make such\r\nseeming concessions as to put a premium upon pacifist agitation\r\nfor peace in the free countries of the West against which they are\r\nfighting. To yield to such peace proposals would be fraught with the\r\ngreatest danger to the Allies, and especially to our own country in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nLet us never forget that no promise Germany makes can be trusted.\r\nThe _kultur_ developed under the Hohenzollerns rests upon shameless\r\ntreachery and duplicity no less than upon ruthless violence and\r\nbarbarity.\r\n\r\nFor example, there are strong indications that Germany may be prepared,\r\nif she now fails on the western front, to abandon all that for which\r\nshe has fought on her western front, provided that in Middle Europe\r\nand in the East there is no interference with her. In other words,\r\nshe would be prepared to give back Alsace and Lorraine to France, to\r\ngive Italian Austria to Italy, to give Luxemburg to Belgium, and to\r\nlet the Allies keep the colonies they have conquered, on condition\r\nthat her dominance in Russia and in the Balkans, her dominance of the\r\nsubject peoples of Austria through the Austrian Hapsburgs, and her\r\ndominance of Western Asia through her vassal state, Turkey, should be\r\nleft undisturbed. To the average American, and probably to the average\r\nEnglishman and Frenchman, there is much that is alluring in such a\r\nprogramme. It might be urged as a method of stopping the frightful\r\nslaughter of war, while securing every purpose for which the free\r\npeoples who still fight are fighting. Yet it would be infinitely better\r\nthat this war were carried on to the point of exhaustion than that we\r\nyield to such terms.\r\n\r\nSuch terms would mean the definite establishment of Germany’s military\r\nascendancy on a scale never hitherto approached in the civilized world.\r\nIt would mean that perhaps within a dozen years, certainly within the\r\nlifetime of the very men now fighting this war, this country and the\r\nother free countries would have to choose between bowing their necks\r\nto the German yoke or else going into another war under conditions far\r\nmore disadvantageous to them.\r\n\r\nA premature and inconclusive peace now would spell ruin for the world,\r\njust as in 1864 a premature and inconclusive peace would have spelled\r\nruin to the United States, and in the present instance the United\r\nStates would share the ruin of the rest of the free peoples of mankind.\r\n\r\nOn the face of it Germany would not become a giant empire. Just exactly\r\nas on the face of it at present Germany, Austria, Turkey, and Bulgaria\r\ncall themselves simply four allied nations, standing on equal terms.\r\nBut in reality those four powers are merely Germany and her three\r\nvassal states, whose military and economic and political powers are all\r\ndisposed of by the Hohenzollerns. A peace such as that above outlined\r\nwould leave these as really one huge empire. The population of these\r\nfour countries, plus the populations of Russian regions recently\r\nannexed by Germany, is over two hundred millions. This population\r\nwould be directed and dominated by the able, powerful, and utterly\r\nbrutal and unscrupulous German governing class, which the very fact of\r\nthe peace would put in the saddle, and the huge empire thus dominated\r\nand directed would become a greater menace to the free peoples than\r\nanything known for the last thousand years.\r\n\r\nShort-sighted people will say that this power would only menace Asia,\r\nand therefore that we need feel no concern about it. There could be no\r\nerror greater or more lamentable. Twenty years hence by mere mass and\r\ngrowth Germany would dominate the Western European powers that have now\r\nfought her. This would mean that the United States would be left as her\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, she would at once trample the Monroe Doctrine under\r\nfoot, and treat tropical and south temperate America as her fields for\r\nexploitation, domination, and conquest. In the next place, she would\r\nsurely trample this country under foot and bleed us white, doing to us\r\non a gigantic scale what she has done to Belgium. If such a peace as is\r\nabove described were at this time made, the United States could by no\r\npossibility escape the fate of Belgium and of the Russian territories\r\ntaken by Germany unless we ourselves became a powerful militarist state\r\nwith every democratic principle subordinated to the one necessity of\r\nturning this Nation into a huge armed camp--I do not mean an armed\r\nnation, as Switzerland is armed, and as I believe this country ought to\r\nbe armed. I mean a nation whose sons, every one of them, would have to\r\nserve from three to five years in the army, and whose whole activities,\r\nexternal and internal, would be conditioned by the one fact of the\r\nnecessity of making head, single-handed, against Germany.\r\n\r\nI very strongly believe that never again should we be caught unprepared\r\nas we have been caught unprepared this time. I believe that all our\r\nyoung men should be trained to arms as the Swiss are trained. But I\r\nwould regard it as an unspeakable calamity for this Nation to have to\r\nturn its whole energies into the kind of exaggerated militarism which\r\nunder such circumstances would alone avail for self-defense.\r\n\r\nThe military power of Germany must be brought low. The subject nations\r\nof Austria, the Balkans, and Western Asia must be freed. We ought not\r\nto refrain an hour longer from going to war with Turkey and Bulgaria.\r\nThey are part of Germany’s military strength. They represent some of\r\nthe most cruel tyrannies over subject peoples for which Germany stands.\r\nIt is idle for us to pretend sympathy with the Armenians unless we war\r\non Turkey, which, with Germany’s assent, has well-nigh crushed the\r\nArmenians out of existence.\r\n\r\nWhen President Wilson stated that this war was waged to make democracy\r\nsafe throughout the world, he properly and definitely committed the\r\nAmerican people to the principles above enunciated, and for the\r\nAmerican people to accept less than their President has thus announced\r\nthat he would insist upon would be unworthy. The President has also\r\nsaid that “there is therefore but one response possible for us.\r\nForce--force to the utmost--force without stint or limit--the righteous\r\nand triumphant force which shall make right the law of the world and\r\ncast every selfish dominion down in the dust.”\r\n\r\nThe American people must support President Wilson unflinchingly in\r\nthe stand to which he is thus committed and must resolutely refuse\r\nto accept any other position. We must guard against any slackening of\r\neffort. We must refuse to accept any premature peace or any peace other\r\nthan the peace of overwhelming victory.\r\n\r\nWe must secure such complete freedom for the peoples of Central Europe\r\nand Western Asia as will shatter forever the threat of German world\r\ndomination. Our honorable obligations to our allies, our loyalty to our\r\nown national principles, the need to protect our American neighbors,\r\nthe need to defend our own land and people, and our hopes for the peace\r\nand happiness of our children’s children all forbid us to accept an\r\nignoble and inconclusive peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WAR SAVINGS CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\nMAY 27, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course the primary factor in deciding this war is and will be the\r\narmy. But there can be no great army in war to-day unless a great\r\nnation stands back of it. The most important of all our needs is\r\nimmensely to strengthen the fighting line at the front. But it cannot\r\nbe permanently strengthened unless the whole Nation is organized back\r\nof the front. We need increased production by all. We need thrift and\r\nthe avoidance of extravagance and of waste of money upon non-essentials\r\nby all. We need the investment of our money in government securities by\r\nall of us.\r\n\r\nThe Government, through the War Savings campaign, offers the\r\nopportunity to every individual in the Nation to join in a great\r\nnational movement to secure these ends. The Treasury Department\r\nproposes as a means to achieve these ends that all our people form\r\nthemselves into Thrift clubs or War Savings societies. This is the\r\npeople’s war. The responsibility for the Government rests on the people\r\nas a whole. The army is the people’s army. It can be supported only\r\nif the people invest in the securities of the Government. And this\r\ninvestment by the people should be as nearly universal as possible.\r\nAll the men and the women and half the children of the land should\r\nbe active members of Uncle Sam’s team. The War Savings campaign\r\noffers them the chance to be active members. This campaign means\r\nthe encouragement of thrift and production. But it means much more\r\nthan this. It also means to make our people realize their solidarity\r\nand mutual interdependence and to make them understand that the\r\nGovernment is really theirs. Therefore it is a movement for genuine\r\nAmericanization of all our people. It is a movement to fuse all our\r\ndifferent race stocks into one great unified nationality. It is\r\nemphatically a movement for nationalism and patriotism.\r\n\r\nBetween thirty and forty millions of our people to-day own Liberty\r\nbonds or War Savings Stamps. All of us who come in this class have an\r\nincreased sense of loyalty and responsibility to the Government. The\r\nTreasury Department has offered through the War Savings plan a great\r\nopportunity for the entire Nation to group itself into War Savings\r\nsocieties or Thrift clubs and thus be of immediate and direct service\r\nto the Government. Neither through government programme and traditions\r\nnor through the habits of the people were we in any way prepared for\r\nthis struggle. We were a spendthrift Nation. One of the roads to\r\nnational unity and national force in this war is through thrift, using\r\nthe word to include both increased production in every field and also\r\nthe conservation of those things which are so desperately needed for\r\nthe winning of the war. The conscientious thrifty man to-day will\r\nconserve food as requested by the Food Administration. He will conserve\r\nfuel as requested by the Fuel Administration. And he will conserve to\r\nthe best of his ability the labor and materials which the Government\r\nneeds by not using his money for purchasing any of the non-essentials\r\nand thereby using up materials and labor needed by the Government. He\r\nwill, by purchasing government securities, entrust the spending of his\r\nmoney to the Government in order to speed up the war and to secure the\r\npeace of overwhelming victory.\r\n\r\nLet all of us join in this movement. The success of the War Savings\r\ncampaign means an immense addition to our war strength. It also means\r\nthe first step in economic preparedness for what is to come after the\r\nwar. We must never return to our haphazard spendthrift ways. Thrift\r\nshould be made a national habit as part of our social and industrial\r\nreadjustment.\r\n\r\nWe are just finishing our Red Cross campaign. Now let us put through\r\nthe War Savings campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANTI-BOLSHEVISM\r\n\r\nJUNE 5, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the whole the worst fate that can befall any country is to fall\r\ninto the hands of the Bolsheviki. Therefore, we should visit with\r\nheavy condemnation the Romanoffs of politics and industry who, by\r\nBourbon-like inability to see or refusal to face the future, make ready\r\nthe way for Bolshevism. Utter ruin will befall this country if it\r\nfalls into the hands of Haywoods and Townleys and of the politicians\r\nwho truckle to them, but the surest way to secure their temporary\r\nand disastrous triumph is to refuse to make every effort, in sane,\r\ngood-tempered, resolute fashion, to deal with the problems which affect\r\nunfavorably the welfare of the farmer and the working-man.\r\n\r\nMere stolid inaction, mere refusal to acknowledge the existence of\r\ntrouble and duty to remedy it amounts to playing into the hands of the\r\nworst and most evil agitators. Such an attitude on the part of our\r\npolitical leaders is almost as bad as the failure to act with instant\r\nreadiness and full strength against disorder or as the time-serving\r\ncowardice which bows to and flatters the leaders of disorder. What is\r\nneeded is unhesitating and thoroughgoing condemnation of, and action\r\nagainst, the anarchists and inciters to sedition and to class envy and\r\nhatred, and at the same time genuine and radical effort to secure for\r\nthe farmer and the working-man and for every one else the square deal\r\nin actual fact. Neither attitude is enough by itself; the two must go\r\ntogether if results of lasting worth are to be secured.\r\n\r\nThe leaders in such movements as the I.W.W. include a large proportion\r\nof men whose activities are criminal, and who, as regards civilization\r\nand all that makes life worth living for decent, hard-working men and\r\nwomen, stand merely as human beasts of prey. But very many of these\r\nfellows are not bad men at all, but merely unfortunates who turn to\r\nan evil organization because no good organization offers them relief\r\nor concerns itself with their welfare. I am not speaking of theory;\r\nI am speaking of fact. I know of cases in connection with the forest\r\nservice where government officials, by acting on behalf of maltreated\r\ncrews of lumber companies and by seeing that they got justice and fair\r\ntreatment, turned them into zealous, right-feeling, public-spirited\r\ncitizens, who, for instance, worked hard and disinterestedly in putting\r\nout forest fires.\r\n\r\nIt is idle to say that no governmental action is needed on behalf of\r\nfarmers and wage-workers. Unquestionably such action will merely do\r\nharm unless at the same time the interests and permanent welfare of\r\nthe business men of the country, great and small, are considered. But\r\nthe action itself is necessary. It should be based on the theory that\r\nso far as possible the work of betterment, alike as regards farmers,\r\nworking-men, and business men, take the form of coöperation among\r\nthemselves, with the maximum amount of individual and collective\r\nprivate effort, and the minimum necessary amount of governmental\r\ncontrol and encouragement. It is not possible to state empirically in\r\nadvance just how far this governmental control and encouragement shall\r\ngo. This must be determined by actual experience in settling what is\r\nnecessary in each individual set of cases. The best result will always\r\ncome where the organization of private citizens is not limited to any\r\none class, but include farmers, working-men, business men; just as is\r\ntrue of one such great organization in the State of Iowa; just as is\r\ntrue of a smaller but successful organization in and around the city\r\nof Springfield, Massachusetts; just as is preëminently true of many\r\nof the state councils of defense. There must be sincere purpose to\r\npush forward and remedy wrong; but there must likewise be firm refusal\r\nto submit to the leadership of either the criminal fringe or the\r\nlunatic fringe. Class hatred is a mighty poor substitute for American\r\nbrotherhood. If we are wise we will proceed by evolution and not\r\nrevolution. But Bourbon refusal to move forward at all merely invites\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL WOOD\r\n\r\nJUNE 15, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nSenator Hiram Johnson has rendered many notable services to the public,\r\nand among them is his recent speech concerning the cruel injustice\r\nwith which Major-General Leonard Wood has been treated and the very\r\ngrave damage thereby done the army and the Allied cause at this\r\ncritical moment of the war.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wood’s entire offense consists in his having, before the war,\r\ncontinually advocated our doing things which now every one in his\r\nsenses admits ought to have been done. Nine tenths of wisdom consists\r\nof being wise in time. General Wood was wise in time. Moreover,\r\nby twenty years of hard, practical work, he fitted himself to do\r\npeculiarly well in this very crisis. He was our senior general in rank,\r\nhe was recognized by the best French and English military authorities\r\nas by experience trained to play an immediate and important part in\r\nthe difficult and perilous joint work of the war. He had testified\r\nat length and with exhaustive professional knowledge before the\r\ncongressional military committees, one year and two years prior to\r\nour entry into the war, pointing out all the military lacks, which\r\nexperience has since shown to exist and which the War Department then\r\ndenied existed. He is to be credited with the only piece of serious\r\nmilitary preparedness in advance which is to our credit. In the service\r\nof 1915, in the teeth of indifference and hostility from his superiors,\r\nhe created the Plattsburg officers’ reserve training camp, starting the\r\nsystem of training camps which has enabled us to officer our draft army.\r\n\r\nHe is in splendid physical condition. Recently when in France he\r\nwas severely wounded by a shell burst, and the surgeons reported his\r\nrecovery as being more rapid than would have been the case with the\r\naverage young man of robust bodily health and vigor. He has done\r\nexcellent work in training his men at Camp Funston. He has been\r\nunwearied in looking after the health and welfare of his men. He has\r\nbeen rewarded by their loyal devotion; they have been profoundly\r\ngrieved and moved by having him suddenly taken from them. The refusal\r\nto use his great ability and energy means a distinct subtraction from\r\nthe sum total of our military efficiency, a distinct addition to the\r\nrisk from disease and discomfort which some of our men at the front\r\nwill have to incur, and a distinct benefit to the cause of Germany.\r\n\r\nNo explanation has been given the American people for the action\r\nconcerning him. Nothing has been made public which warrants our belief\r\nthat this action was due either to professional or to patriotic\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHELP RUSSIA NOW\r\n\r\nJUNE 20, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nRussia has been thrown under the iron tyranny of German militarism\r\nand capitalism by the Bolshevists of the Lenine type. The Russian\r\npeople are slowly awakening to this bitter truth. The far-sighted, the\r\nRussians of genuine patriotism, have long been awake, but the peasants,\r\nwho are at heart good, but who are ignorant and misled, are now\r\nawakening also. Plenty of them, especially among the Cossacks, are well\r\naware that submission to Germany now means death for Russia. Plenty of\r\nthem are eager to fight and know well that only by successful war on a\r\ngrand scale can Russia now be saved and regenerated, but they must have\r\nhelp and the help must be given immediately or it may be too late, and\r\nAmerica can best give the help.\r\n\r\nA Russian peasant woman who can hardly write her name is here to ask\r\nthat the help be given immediately and that it be given in Siberia.\r\nShe is a remarkable character in her strength, her simplicity, her\r\ndirect straightforwardness, and her intense earnestness and entire\r\ndisinterestedness. She was a major in the Russian army until the\r\nRussian army was betrayed and dissolved. Her peasant husband was\r\nkilled in the ranks. She served in the ranks of a regiment of men. She\r\ncommanded in a regiment of women. She has been wounded four times. She\r\nwas born in Tomsk, Siberia. She is a peasant of the best class, in\r\nhabits of thought and belief and life and sympathy. But she has a wide\r\noutlook. She knows that America will keep her word about Siberia, just\r\nas America kept her word about Cuba. She asks that for our own sake,\r\njust as much as for Russia’s sake, we now send an army to Siberia,\r\nentering through Vladivostok or Harbin, or through both. She asks us to\r\nannounce that after the war is over we guarantee to return to Russia\r\nher country with the right for her people to decide for themselves\r\nhow they are to be governed, and that in the war we fight with and for\r\nall the Russians who will fight against Germany for Russia, and that\r\nwe fight to the death against the Germans and against all Russians who\r\nside with the Germans.\r\n\r\nSiberia is in chaos. Eastern Siberia has plenty of food and contains\r\nlarge elements of the population, especially Cossacks, who would\r\npromptly join with an Allied force which they believed would, in good\r\nfaith, aid in the reconquest of Russia for the purpose of giving it\r\nback to the Russians themselves. West of Lake Baikal is a region\r\ndominated by a German army, some twenty thousand strong, composed of\r\nformer German prisoners of war, who are organized under the name of\r\nthe German Red Guards and who are the permanent adherents of German\r\nautocracy, but who help the cause of Russian anarchy in order to\r\nconquer Russia for the German autocracy. West of these again a stretch\r\nof country, which includes the passes of the Ural Mountains, is held\r\nby the splendid Czechs, who, by the way, must at the end of this\r\nwar be rewarded by seeing an independent Czech-Slovak commonwealth\r\nestablished, just as there must also be a great Jugo-Slav commonwealth.\r\n\r\nAt once there should be in East Siberia an American army of say thirty\r\nthousand men with a Japanese army of the same size and a British\r\nimperial army of as nearly the same size as possible. If there was\r\ndifficulty as to the command of the Allied forces, borrow some man of\r\ngreat reputation, Joffre, for instance, from France. Let the woman\r\nmajor above spoken of and other Russian friends of the peasants and of\r\na Russian republic go in advance to make clear that the Allied army\r\ncomes only to restore Russia to the Russians. Let all Russians who\r\njoin be paid by the United States on the same scale as our own troops,\r\nand if necessary let the United States guarantee the payment of the\r\nJapanese. Move against the German Red Guards as quickly as possible\r\nand then push instantly to join the heroic Czechs in the Urals. Let\r\nthe railroads be organized back of the army by our best railroad men\r\nand let them carry immediately behind the army immense quantities of\r\nclothing, boots, and farm machinery. Siberia has food and it will\r\nfurnish hundreds of thousands of soldiers who will rally around such\r\nan Allied army as a nucleus. Before this army reached the Urals, the\r\nGermans would have to prepare to meet it and their pressure on the\r\nWestern front would thereby be relieved.\r\n\r\nRussia is at this moment lost, so that no change in Russia can make\r\nthings worse for the Allies than they now are. We ought to have acted\r\nwith energy and intelligence on her behalf a year ago. Let us at least\r\nact now, for no possible action can be worse than our inaction. She\r\ndoes not need talk and envoys to study the situation. She needs an\r\narmy to serve as a nucleus around which she can create her own immense\r\narmies. The above plan is better than none. If our Government can\r\ndevise a better, let them do so, but let us act at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN AMERICAN FOURTH OF JULY\r\n\r\nJUNE 23, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is announced that on the Fourth of July the celebration is to be\r\nby race groups--that is, by Scandinavians, Slavs, Germans, Italians,\r\nand so forth. In sport organizations it may be necessary to have such\r\na kind of divided celebration in some places, but I most emphatically\r\nprotest against such a type of celebration being general, and I doubt\r\nwhether it is advisable to have it anywhere. On the contrary, I believe\r\nthat we should make the Fourth of July a genuine Americanization day,\r\nand should use it to teach the prime lesson of Americanism, which is\r\nthat there is no room in the country for the perpetuation of separate\r\nrace groups or racial divisions; that we must all be Americans and\r\nnothing but Americans, and that therefore on the Fourth of July we\r\nshould all get together simply as Americans and celebrate the day as\r\nsuch without regard to our several racial origins.\r\n\r\nAt two thirds of the places where I have made speeches on Americanism\r\n(and these speeches have at least been free from any pussy-footing on\r\nAmericanism), I have been introduced by straight Americans who were\r\nin whole or in part of German blood. At Milwaukee, for example, I was\r\nintroduced by August Vogel, who has three sons already in the army and\r\na fourth who will enter this summer. At Martinsville, Indiana, I was\r\nintroduced by the mayor, George F. Schmidt, who has two sons in the\r\narmy. One of the sons, Wayne Schmidt, was the catcher of the University\r\nof Indiana baseball nine. He was in the same regiment with my two\r\nsons, Ted and Archie, and like Archie has been severely wounded. Mayor\r\nSchmidt writes me:\r\n\r\n We are proud of Wayne and hope that his wounds will soon heal and that\r\n he may get back to his regiment and continue to serve his country.\r\n There is nothing fifty-fifty in this boy’s blood or any of his kin.\r\n His greatest ambition is to lead a company up the streets of Berlin.\r\n\r\nThis speaks the true American!\r\n\r\nI also have German blood in my veins. We Vogels and Schmidts and\r\nRoosevelts intend to celebrate the Fourth of July with all our fellow\r\nAmericans, without regard to whether they are of German, English or\r\nIrish, French, Scandinavian, Spanish, or Italian blood. Unless they\r\nare Americans and nothing else, they are out of place at a Fourth of\r\nJuly celebration, and if they are straight Americans, absolutely loyal\r\nto America, and resolutely bent on putting this war through until\r\nit is crowned by the peace of complete victory, then we are their\r\nbrothers, their fellow Americans, and we decline to permit any lines of\r\nseparation between us and them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW NOT TO ADJOURN POLITICS\r\n\r\nJUNE 25, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the current North American Review and its supplemental War Weekly\r\nthere are two strong and deeply patriotic articles on the President’s\r\nrecent announcement that politics is to be adjourned. When contrasted\r\nwith the injection of politics by the President into the senatorial\r\ncontests in Wisconsin and Michigan, never before in any great crisis in\r\nthis country has there been such complete subordination of patriotism\r\nto politics as by this Administration during this war. Witness the\r\nactivities of the organization under Messrs. Burleson and Creel and the\r\nworking alliance between the Administration and the Hearst newspapers,\r\nwhile Vice-President Marshall and Secretary McAdoo give the signal for\r\nfrank partisanship of an extreme type in their public speeches. The\r\nvarious activities are, of course, co-related and directed toward the\r\nsame end.\r\n\r\nIn Wisconsin the President interfered by a personal appeal for the\r\nDemocratic senatorial candidate against the Republican. He based his\r\nappeal on certain alleged positions taken by the Republican candidate,\r\nMr. Lenroot, during the two years and a half preceding our entry into\r\nthe war, which positions, he asserted, did not meet the “acid test” of\r\npatriotism. The President made the conduct of our public men during\r\nthe two years and a half prior to the war the test by which they are\r\nto be judged, and where he himself applies this test to others he must\r\nhimself be judged by it.\r\n\r\nHis supporters make the plea that to call attention to the President’s\r\nrecord during these two and a half years is to cry over spilt milk. But\r\nthe President’s attack on Lenroot was a square repudiation of this\r\nplea when it applied to anybody except himself. In reality the “acid\r\ntest” of patriotism during these two and a half years is to be found\r\nin the use of phrases like “too proud to fight” and “peace without\r\nvictory” and the refusal to act instead of merely talking after the\r\nsinking of the Lusitania; in the fatuous refusal to prepare and in the\r\ninsistence on preserving an ignoble neutrality between right and wrong\r\nbetween those who were fighting to make the world safe for democracy\r\nand liberty and those who were fighting to overthrow both. Tried by the\r\ntest of past conduct which the President applied to Mr. Lenroot, he is\r\nhimself found wanting. Mr. Lenroot spilled a teaspoonful of milk, but\r\nMr. Wilson spilled a bucketful and he must not call attention to the\r\nteaspoon and expect to escape having attention called to the bucket.\r\n\r\nThe President has now personally requested Mr. Henry Ford to come\r\nforward as his personal candidate for the Senate in Michigan. This\r\naction cannot be reconciled either with the President’s statement that\r\npolitics must be adjourned or with the reasons he alleged for opposing\r\nMr. Lenroot. No man was a more intense pacifist, no man struggled\r\nharder against preparedness, no man was more eagerly hailed as an\r\nally by the pro-Germans than Mr. Ford during the two and a half years\r\nbefore we did our duty and entered the war. He is not a Republican;\r\nhe is not a Democrat. He supported Mr. Wilson on the “he kept us out\r\nof war” issue. Mr. Wilson can only desire his election on grounds of\r\npersonal politics, as Mr. Wilson wishes as associates not strong men,\r\nbut servants, and from the servants he demands servility even more\r\nthan service. I have not the slightest political feeling when politics\r\ncomes into hostile contact with patriotism and Americanism. There is no\r\npublic servant whom during the past year I have supported more heartily\r\nthan the Democratic Senator, Chamberlain. I oppose Mr. Ford, because\r\nin the great crisis I feel that his election would be a calamity from\r\nthe standpoint of far-sighted and patriotic Americanism. I would oppose\r\nhim if he had been nominated by the Republican Party. I oppose him in\r\nprecisely the same spirit now that he has been nominated on personal\r\ngrounds by Mr. Wilson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHATS OFF TO THE INTERNATIONAL TYPOGRAPHICAL UNION\r\n\r\nJUNE 27, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThe published reports of the International Typographical Union,\r\nissued from Indianapolis, make a very remarkable showing and put that\r\norganization high on the honor roll of America for the Great War.\r\n\r\nForty-one hundred journeymen members of the union and seven hundred\r\napprentices are in the military and naval forces of the United States\r\nand Canada. Seventy-five members have already paid with their lives\r\nfor their devotion to their country. The union has paid $22,000\r\nmortuary benefits to the widows, orphans, and mothers of these men.\r\nThe union, through its executive council, has invested $90,000 in the\r\nLiberty loans, and subordinate local unions and individual members have\r\ninvested $3,000,000 in the Liberty loans.\r\n\r\nThese are war-time activities. During the same period the International\r\nTypographical Union has continued all its ordinary benefit works. It\r\nhas paid over $350,000 to fifteen hundred old-age pensioners, over\r\n$300,000 in mortuary benefits, and $170,000 to the Union Printers’\r\nHome at Colorado Springs. Every dollar has been paid by members of the\r\norganization in the form of regular dues and assessments. The union\r\nneither solicits nor accepts contributions to its benefit funds.\r\n\r\nDuring the same period the union has expended only $1200 for strike\r\nexpenses. The union acts in thoroughgoing patriotic fashion on the\r\nconviction that there should be no strikes or lockouts during the\r\nwar. Its officers regard themselves as volunteers in the army for the\r\npreservation of industrial peace, at least for the duration of the\r\nwar, and I hope for long after the war. Such conduct offers a striking\r\ncontrast to the action of certain corporations which during this war\r\nhave refused to permit their employees to organize. Labor has as much\r\nright as capital to organize. It is tyranny to forbid the exercise\r\nof this right, just as it is tyranny to misuse the power acquired by\r\norganization. The people of the United States do not believe in tyranny\r\nand do believe in coöperation.\r\n\r\nThe International Typographical Union has offered an admirable\r\nexample of Americanism and patriotism. Its attitude is typical of the\r\nattitude of organized labor generally. Hats off to the International\r\nTypographical Union! And hats off to the working-men and working-women\r\nof the United States!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERFORMANCE OF A GREAT PUBLIC DUTY\r\n\r\nJULY 3, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is announced from Washington that the President has been converted\r\nto the need of universal military training of our young men, as a\r\npermanent policy. This is excellent. If this policy is forthwith\r\nincorporated into our laws, it will represent an immense national\r\nadvance. In the first place, it will guarantee us against a repetition\r\nof the humiliating experiences of the last four years, when our\r\nhelpless refusal to prepare invited Germany’s attack upon us and then\r\nforced us to rely entirely upon our allies to protect us from that\r\nattack while for over a year we slowly made ready to defend ourselves.\r\nIn the next place, it will immeasurably increase the moral and physical\r\nefficiency of the young men who are trained and fit them both to do\r\nbetter for themselves and to perform in better fashion the tasks of\r\nAmerican citizenship. Finally it is essential that the policy should\r\nbe adopted now while we are at war and therefore while our people are\r\nawake to the needs of the situation. As soon as peace comes, there\r\nwill be a revival of the sinister agitation of the pro-German or other\r\nanti-American leaders and of the silly clamor of the pacifists, all\r\nof whom will with brazen folly again reiterate that preparedness ends\r\nwith war, and that, anyhow, all war can be averted by signing scraps\r\nof paper. The adoption at once of the policy of obligatory universal\r\nmilitary training will be the performance of a great public duty.\r\n\r\nFor three years the foremost advocates of this policy have pointed\r\nout that it can advantageously be combined with a certain amount of\r\nindustrial training. It is earnestly to be hoped that this element of\r\nindustrial training will be incorporated in the law. Of course, in such\r\ncase the length of service with the colors in the field, aside from\r\npreliminary training in the higher school grades, ought to be a year,\r\nso as to avoid superficiality. Credit should be given the graduates of\r\ncertain scholastic institutions or to individuals who speedily attain\r\na high degree of proficiency, and for them the time of service could\r\nbe shortened. All officers or other candidates for officers’ training\r\nschools would be chosen from among the best of the men who had gone\r\nthrough the training, without regard to anything except their fitness.\r\nThis would represent the embodiment in our army of the democratic\r\nprinciple which insists upon an equal chance for all, equal justice for\r\nall, and the need for leadership, and therefore for special rewards for\r\nleadership. The industrial training could be so shaped as to emphasize\r\nthe need that hard workers who are efficient should become in a real\r\nsense partners in industry, and that insistence upon efficiency should\r\nbe accompanied by a fair division of the rewards of efficiency, and by\r\ninsistence that the work should be made healthful and interesting, so\r\nthat its faithful performance would be a matter of pride and pleasure.\r\n\r\nAt this moment our training camps are huge universities, huge\r\nlaboratories of fine American citizenship. Let us make them permanent\r\ninstitutions. They develop both power of initiative and power of\r\nobedience. They inculcate self-reliance and self-respect. They also\r\ninculcate respect for others and readiness for discipline, which\r\nmeans readiness to use our collective power in such shape as to make\r\nus threefold more efficient than we have been. To make these camps\r\npermanent training schools for all our young men would mean the\r\ngreatest boon this Nation could receive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPEAL THE CHARTER OF THE GERMAN-AMERICAN ALLIANCE\r\n\r\nJULY 11, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThe United States Senate has struck an effective blow against the\r\nHun within our gates by unanimously voting to repeal the charter of\r\nthe German-American Alliance. It is earnestly to be hoped that the\r\nHouse will at once follow suit with like unanimity. The Alliance has\r\nbeen thoroughly mischievous in its activities. It has acted in the\r\ninterest of Germany and against the interest of America. It has tried\r\nto perpetuate Germanism as a separate nationality with a separate\r\nlanguage in the United States; it has attacked our allies; it has\r\nencouraged disloyalty; it was decorated by the Kaiser for its services\r\nto Germany. It has endeavored to prostitute our politics to German\r\nneeds. I have personally had the honor of being specially singled out\r\nby it for attack. It received money from the Brewers’ Association for\r\nthe campaign against prohibition.\r\n\r\nAt this time, when the campaign of German frightfulness is in full\r\nblast, when the Prussianized Germany of the Hohenzollerns is steadily\r\nadding to its list of literally unforgivable offenses against\r\ncivilization, there is no room in this country for any organization,\r\ngreat or small, which either defends Germany or is lukewarm in the\r\ngreat crusade against her in which America will henceforth play\r\na leading part. Germany has recently scored another victory for\r\nfrightfulness by sinking a Canadian hospital ship without warning and\r\ndrowning two hundred persons, including women nurses. The ship was a\r\nmercy vessel, not a warship, and was so distinctly marked that it was\r\nimpossible to mistake it. The attack upon it was sheer murder. Yet the\r\nGerman people tolerate, applaud, and approve the action of the German\r\nGovernment in this continuous and methodically organized campaign of\r\nmurder, rape, and outrage.\r\n\r\nThe most complete exposure of Germany’s infamous purpose in forcing\r\nthis dreadful war upon the world is contained in the pamphlet written\r\nby the leading German steel magnate, Herr August Thyssen. This pamphlet\r\nhas been translated into English, has been put into the official\r\nrecord by Senator Owen, of Oklahoma, has been printed in full in\r\nthe San Francisco Argonaut and Baltimore Manufacturers’ Record, and\r\ncirculated in pamphlet form by Mr. J. G. Butler, Jr., of Youngstown,\r\nOhio. It is accessible to everybody. Herr Thyssen has no conception\r\nof the monstrous turpitude of the plan which he supported. His only\r\ncomplaint is that he and the other German financiers were fooled by\r\nthe German Kaiser and the German Government, who promised them victory\r\nand failed to furnish it. He proves that German capitalism was just as\r\nresponsible for the war as German militarism (which incidentally shows\r\nthe peculiar infamy of the Russian Bolshevists and American Socialists\r\nand their allies in playing Germany’s game). He shows that Germany’s\r\nruthless brutality was equaled by her sordid greed. He showed that\r\nthe Hohenzollern Government, through the Emperor and the Chancellor,\r\ndeliberately planned the war over a year and a half before it broke\r\nout, and at that time and on several occasions gathered the leading\r\nbusiness men of Germany, informed them of the plans, and got their\r\nsupport by holding out the war as one of sheer plunder. The other\r\nnations were to be attacked simply in order to rob them naked. Herr\r\nThyssen himself was promised thirty thousand acres in Australia. The\r\nEmperor particularly dwelt on the conquest of India, saying that the\r\nEnglish allowed the vast Indian revenue to be used for and by the\r\nIndians themselves, but that Germany after her conquest would turn the\r\nwhole “Golden Stream into the Fatherland.” There could be no finer\r\ntribute to England when compared with Germany than that which is thus\r\nfurnished by the Emperor.\r\n\r\nIn point of international morality the Germany of the Hohenzollerns has\r\nbecome the wild beast of the nations. Whoever directly or indirectly\r\nworks for her or against our allies or who is merely lukewarm in the\r\nwar is an enemy of this country, and an enemy of all mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVERY MAN HAS A RIGHT TO ONE COUNTRY\r\n\r\nJULY 15, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery man ought to love his country. If he does not love his country\r\nand is not eager to serve her, he is a worthless creature and should\r\nbe contemptuously thrown out of the country when possible, and at any\r\nrate debarred from all rights of citizenship in the country. He is only\r\nentitled to one country. If he claims loyalty to two countries, he is\r\nnecessarily a traitor to at least one country. If he claims to be loyal\r\nto both Germany and America, he is necessarily a traitor to America. No\r\nman can be a good American now unless he is an enemy of Germany and\r\nGermany’s allies and a stanch supporter of America’s allies.\r\n\r\nBut it is just as wicked and just as un-American to deny the loyal\r\nAmerican, of whatever origin, the full benefit of his allegiance to\r\none country as it is to permit the disloyal American to exercise a\r\ntreacherous alternative allegiance to two countries. Every man has a\r\nright to one country. He has a right to love and serve that country and\r\nto feel that it is absolutely his country and that he has in it every\r\nright possessed by any one else. It is our duty to require the man of\r\nGerman blood who is an American citizen to give up all allegiance to\r\nGermany whole-heartedly and without on his part any mental reservation\r\nwhatever. If he does this, it becomes no less our duty to give him the\r\nfull rights of an American, including our loyal respect and friendship\r\nwithout on our part any mental reservation whatever. The duties are\r\nreciprocal, and from the standpoint of American patriotism one is as\r\nimportant as the other.\r\n\r\nThere has been nothing finer in this war, nothing of better augury\r\nfor the future of America, than the high courage and splendid loyalty\r\nshown by the American soldiers and sailors who are of German blood.\r\nRelatively to their number they have come forward as freely into the\r\nranks of our fighting men as the Americans of any other stock, and\r\nall alike have shown the same soldierly efficiency, the same devoted\r\npatriotism, and, when the need arose, the same heroism. The crew of\r\nthe torpedo destroyer who face the submarine, and the airmen of the\r\nbattle planes whose lives are in peril every hour, and the infantry\r\nstoggers and doughboys and marines who stand the killing and suffer the\r\ngrueling hardship and misery of the line fighting, all alike number in\r\ntheir ranks relatively just as many Americans of German as of any other\r\nblood. Any one can see this who will look over the lists of casualties\r\nand the lists of men cited for deeds of high gallantry. The official\r\nreports of the German officers bear unintended testimony to the intense\r\nand patriotic Americanism of these men whom the Hohenzollern officials\r\nsneer at as “half Americans,” and who, even when taken prisoners, are\r\nadmitted by the German army officers to “express without hesitation\r\npurely American sentiments.” In other words, the Pan-German propaganda\r\non behalf of German _kultur_ has broken down in America, and as a\r\nconsequence there are no people in this country so hated in the\r\nPrussianized Germany of the Hohenzollerns as the Americans of German\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nThe very worst enemies of these Americans have been the traitors and\r\ndupes of traitors who have been during the last few years the leaders\r\nof the German-American Alliance and of the newspapers in German or\r\nEnglish who have backed up the Alliance and similar organizations. The\r\ndissolution by law of the Alliance and the gradual change of German\r\nnewspapers into newspapers published in English will be of benefit to\r\ntrue Americans of German blood more than any other of our citizens.\r\nBut the Americans of other blood must remember that the man who in good\r\nfaith and without reservations gives up another country for this must\r\nin return receive exactly the same rights, not merely legal, but social\r\nand spiritual, that other Americans proudly possess. We of the United\r\nStates belong to a new and separate nationality. We are all Americans\r\nand nothing else, and each, without regard to his birthplace, creed, or\r\nnational origin, is entitled to exactly the same rights as all other\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMURDER, TREASON, AND PARLOR ANARCHY\r\n\r\nJULY 18, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the cheapest methods by which some well-meaning, silly people,\r\nand some sinister people who are not well-meaning, achieve a reputation\r\nfor broad-minded liberality in matters relating to social reforms is\r\nto champion or excuse criminality on the ground that it is due to\r\nsocial conditions. The parlor anarchist or parlor Bolshevist is not\r\nan attractive person, and he may be mischievous when he joins the\r\ngenuine anarchist, the “direct” man with the bomb, because selfish\r\nand unpatriotic politicians then find it advantageous to pander to\r\nboth. This species of parlor anarchist appeals to emotional persons of\r\nsuperficial cultivation, whether writers, college men, sham economists,\r\nor sham religious and charitable workers, because it makes no demand\r\neither upon robust vigor of soul or thoroughness of mental process.\r\nAt the moment it manifests itself in sympathy for the I.W.W. and for\r\nconvicted dynamiters and murderers like Mooney.\r\n\r\nThere are honest and ignorant working-men who join the I.W.W. because\r\nthey are misled or because in some given locality industrial conditions\r\nreally are intolerable. I have heard on good authority of logging\r\ncamps, for instance, where the men joined the I.W.W. and practiced\r\nsabotage because they were treated tyrannically and foolishly and\r\nwhere good treatment turned them into good citizens. But I know far\r\nmore numerous instances in which the leaders have simply been thugs\r\nand murderous malefactors whose criminality was not in the least due\r\nto social conditions, but to their own foul natures. By all means let\r\nus remedy the social conditions that are wrong, but let us shun, as we\r\nwould shun the plague, that mawkish sentimentality of downright moral\r\nand physical cowardice which fears to call murder, treason, violence,\r\narson, and rape by their right names and treat them as crimes to be\r\npunished with relentless severity.\r\n\r\nActually there have been make-believe social reformers who have sought\r\nto excuse a brute who raped a little girl on the ground that social\r\nconditions made him what he was, and others who on similar grounds have\r\nprotested against the condign punishment of men who burn haystacks,\r\nruin machinery, dynamite peace parades, and, in the interest of\r\nGerman agents, destroy machinery in mines or munition factories. Any\r\nman who is misled in these matters can get full information by buying\r\na pamphlet recently written by a former Socialist, Mr. Everett Harri,\r\ncalled “The I.W.W. an Auxiliary of the German Espionage System.” The\r\nsimple truth is that the men who lead and give the tone to the I.W.W.\r\nare more dangerous criminals than an equal number of white-slavers and\r\nblack-handers, and to give aid and comfort to one set of enemies of the\r\nNation is as bad as to give aid and comfort to the others.\r\n\r\nThe ablest, most far-sighted, and most patriotic of the heads of\r\norganized labor are more opposed to the I.W.W. as it is at present\r\nhandled than are any other persons in the Nation. In just the same way\r\nthe farmers whose resentment of wrongdoing is keenest should repudiate\r\nthe Non-Partisan League just as long as it submits to such leadership\r\nas that of most of the men who are at present at its head, and just so\r\nlong as it stands for covert disloyalty, as it has recently done on so\r\nmany different occasions in so many different places. I am well aware\r\nthat great numbers of honest and loyal farmers of high character have\r\njoined the League, because they rightly think that many of the economic\r\nconditions now affecting the farmer imperatively call for remedy. There\r\nare any number of men like myself who will join with the farmers in\r\nany sane and patriotic movement to remedy these conditions, no matter\r\nhow radical such a movement may be. But we will join with no movement\r\nwhose leaders are tainted with disloyalty, or who refuse to give to\r\nothers the same square deal they demand for themselves, or who fail to\r\ninsist that here in America the one organization to which we all of\r\nus owe a loyalty greater than is any other, greater than to any labor\r\nunion or farmers’ league or business or professional body, is the union\r\nof the entire American people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBACK UP THE FIGHTING MEN AT THE FRONT\r\n\r\nJULY 26, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no American worth calling such whose veins do not thrill with\r\npride when he reads of what has been done by General Pershing and his\r\ngallant army in France. The soldiers over there who wear the American\r\nuniform have made all good Americans forever their debtors. Now and\r\nalways afterward we of this country will walk with our heads high\r\nbecause of the men who face death and wounds, and so many of whom have\r\ngiven their lives fighting for this Nation and for the great ideals of\r\nhumanity across the seas.\r\n\r\nBut we must not let our pride and our admiration evaporate in mere\r\npride, in mere admiration of what others have done. We must put the\r\nwhole strength of this Nation back of the fighting men at the front. We\r\nowe it to them. We owe it at least as much to the gallant Allies, who\r\nfor near four years fought the great battle that was our battle, no\r\nless than theirs.\r\n\r\nAt last we have begun to come to their assistance, but let us solemnly\r\nrealize that we came very late, and that it is a dreadful thing if we\r\nwaste one hour that can now be saved, or weaken in the smallest degree\r\nany effort that can be made. The inability, or refusal, of Bolshevist\r\nRussia to do her part in the great war for liberty and democracy has\r\ncast a terrible added burden upon the Allies. On the eastern front\r\nthis has meant the temporary Allied ruin and the freeing of the armies\r\nof the autocracy for action against the western peoples. England,\r\nFrance, and Belgium for four years and Italy for over three years have\r\nbeen fighting the battle of civilization. Their man power is terribly\r\ndepleted. Thank Heaven, we have got some hundreds of thousands of\r\nsoldiers across in time to be a real element in saving Paris. Our first\r\nduty, if we wish to win the war, is to save Paris. Temporarily, at\r\nleast, and I hope permanently, we have done our part in this respect.\r\nBut the least faltering, the least letting-up, or failure in pushing\r\nforward our preparations and our assistance, would be dangerous to the\r\nAllied cause and a wicked desertion of our allies.\r\n\r\nFrom now on America should make this peculiarly America’s war. From now\r\non we should take the burden of the war upon our shoulders. We should\r\nmove forward at once with all the force that there is in us. We should\r\nnot allow the war to drag for so much as a day, and above all we should\r\nnot permit our people to fall under the spell of pacifist dreams or\r\npossible pacifist actions. There should not be intermission of so much\r\nas a week in sending our troops across the seas. This war won’t be won\r\nby food, or by money, or by savings, or by Thrift Stamps, or by the Red\r\nCross, or by anything else, although all of these will help win the\r\nwar. It will be won by the valor of the fighting men at the front, and\r\nthis valor will fail unless our fighting men at the front are millions\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nEvery week this summer and fall we should be putting fresh troops by\r\nscores of thousands across the ocean, and now, to-day, this week, we\r\nshould provide for placing a larger army in the field next spring than\r\nGermany itself, or France and England combined. We are a more populous,\r\na richer country than Germany, we have a larger population than Great\r\nBritain and France combined. These nations have fought for four years.\r\nWe have only just begun to fight. Let us at once mobilize the whole\r\nman power of this country between the ages of nineteen and fifty or\r\nsixty. The draft should take in all men of nineteen, even if they were\r\nnot sent abroad until they were twenty years old. Let us act at once.\r\nPerhaps we can beat the Germans this year if we keep pouring our troops\r\nover with the utmost speed. But let us take no chances. Let us proceed\r\nupon the assumption that Germany will fight next spring, and therefore\r\nlet us act instantly so that by spring we will have in France an army\r\nof fighting men, exclusive of non-combatants and exclusive of home\r\ndépôts, which shall amount to four million armed soldiers at the very\r\nleast. Let us fight beside the French, the British, the Italians, and\r\nbe ready to fight instantly in the Balkan Peninsula and in Asia Minor\r\nagainst the Germans and all her vassal states. There must be no delay,\r\nnot by so much as one hour, and no letting-up for one moment in the\r\ncause of our entire strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICANS WHOM WE MOST DELIGHT TO HONOR\r\n\r\nAUGUST 1, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nAt long intervals in the history of a nation there come great days\r\nwhen the picked sons of the Nation determine for generations to come\r\nthat nation’s place in history. During the last few weeks our fighting\r\nmen in France have rendered all the rest of us forever their debtors.\r\nThey have won high honor for themselves and for their country. Our\r\nchildren’s children will owe them deep gratitude for what they have\r\ndone. All Americans hold their heads higher because of their deeds.\r\n\r\nTheir achievement has been won at the cost of perseverance in training\r\nand of resolution in facing unbelievable hardship and fatigue. It has\r\nalso cost and will cost the death, the crippling, and the wounding of\r\nmany scores of thousands of our best and bravest. We who stay behind\r\nin ease and comfort, who show our patriotism by economizing on sugar\r\nor wheat or beef instead of by living in our clothes until they rot\r\noff us in the trenches, or who pay money for taxes and bonds and Thrift\r\nStamps instead of paying with our blood, owe an incalculable debt to\r\nthe men at the front and to the mothers, wives, and little children of\r\nthose who are killed at the front. We must pay this debt.\r\n\r\nThe debt is due to our wonderful fighting men at the front\r\nindividually, to our army collectively, and to this Nation as a whole.\r\nWe must provide for the crippled men and for the widows and children\r\nof the dead. Nothing that we can do will lighten the bitter sorrow of\r\nthose who have lost the men they loved; stern pride in the courage\r\nand gallant devotion of those who are dead is the only staff that\r\nwill help to carry that burden for the living. But the material needs\r\nof the survivors must be met with ample generosity and yet in the\r\nonly permanently effective fashion, by training those who need help\r\nto help themselves and achieve an ever-increasing self-respect and\r\nself-reliance.\r\n\r\nWe must now help the army as a whole by straining every nerve without\r\na day’s delay immensely to increase our strength, our numbers, and our\r\nresources at the front. We should provide now, and as a matter of fact\r\nwe ought to have provided six months ago, for an army of six or seven\r\nmillion men, so that when next spring opens we may have at least four\r\nmillion fighting men at the front. We are more populous than Germany,\r\nor France and Great Britain combined, and we should provide so that two\r\nyears after we entered the war our army shall be as large as Germany’s\r\nor as the combined forces of our allies in France. We should speed to\r\nthe limit the work of the ships, guns, and airplanes. At present our\r\narmy is in France mainly because of the aid of British ships, and it\r\nis able to fight mainly because of the field cannon and even airplanes\r\nit has received from the French. The draft limit should be immensely\r\nincreased and the exceptions immensely decreased.\r\n\r\nTo stand by the army is to stand by the Nation, and therefore to stand\r\nby the Allies to whom our national faith is plighted. This war will\r\nbe won by the fighting men at the front. All other work is merely\r\nauxiliary and is entirely subordinate to theirs. Let us provide for the\r\narmy instantly, and let us provide for the Nation’s future permanently\r\nby at once introducing the policy of universal obligatory military\r\ntraining for all our young men.\r\n\r\nThe fighting men at the front are the men most worthy of honor. Let\r\nevery American lad hereafter be trained so that in time of need he can\r\nfill this most honorable of all positions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUND NATIONALISM AND SOUND INTERNATIONALISM\r\n\r\nAUGUST 4, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThe glorious victory of the Allies in the second battle of the Marne, a\r\nvictory in which the hard-fighting soldiers of the American army have\r\nborne so distinguished and honorable a part, may mean the failure of\r\nthe German military offensive for this year. Therefore it may mean a\r\nrenewal of the German peace offensive. No man can prophesy in these\r\nmatters, but the Germans may continue the war for a long time; and\r\ntherefore we should prepare to have in France an army of four million\r\nfighting men for the battle front next spring. But the Germans may try\r\nto make peace instead of continuing the war, and may seek to cover\r\ntheir retention of some of their ill-gotten substantial gains by\r\nnominal and theoretical support of some glittering proposal about a\r\nleague of nations to end all war. They will thereby hope to keep part\r\nof their booty by appealing to what is vaguely called internationalism\r\nand getting the support not only of sentimentalists who do not like to\r\nlook unpleasant facts in the face, but also of the good people who are\r\nappalled and puzzled and panic-struck by the horror Germany has brought\r\non the world, and who, instead of bracing themselves to put down this\r\nhorror by their own hardened strength and iron will, clutch at any\r\nquack remedy which false prophets hold out as offering a substitute for\r\nsuch action.\r\n\r\nTherefore it is well at this time for sober and resolute men and\r\nwomen to apply that excellent variety of wisdom colloquially known as\r\n“horse sense” to the problems of nationalism and internationalism.\r\nThese problems will not be solved by rhetoric. Least of all will\r\nthey be solved by competitive rhetoric. Masters of phrase-making may\r\nwin immense, although evanescent, applause by outvying one another\r\nin words that glitter, but these glittering words will not have one\r\nshred of lasting effect on the outcome except in so far as they may\r\nhave a very mischievous effect if they persuade people to abandon the\r\npossible real good in the fantastic effort to achieve an impossible,\r\nunreal perfection. Let honest men and women remember that this kind of\r\nphrase-mongering does not represent idealism. The only idealism worth\r\nconsidering in the workaday business of this world is applied idealism.\r\nThis is merely another way of saying that permanent good to humanity\r\nonly comes from actually trying to reduce ideals to practice, and this\r\nmeans that the ideals must be substantially or at least measurably\r\nrealizable.\r\n\r\nThe professed internationalist usually sneers at nationalism, at\r\npatriotism, and at what we call Americanism. He bids us forswear\r\nour love of country in the name of love of the world at large. We\r\nnationalists answer that he has begun at the wrong end; we say that as\r\nthe world now is, it is only the man who ardently loves his country\r\nfirst who in actual practice can help any other country at all. The\r\ninternationalist bids us promise to abandon the idea of keeping America\r\npermanently ready to defend her rights by her strength, and to trust,\r\ninstead, to scraps of paper, to written agreements by which all nations\r\nform a league, and agree to disarm and agree each to treat all other\r\nnations, big or little, on an exact equality. We nationalists answer\r\nthat we are ready to join any league to enforce peace or similar\r\norganization which offers a likelihood of in some measure lessening\r\nthe number and the area of future wars, but only on condition that\r\nin the first place we do not promise what will not or ought not to\r\nbe performed, or be guilty of proclaiming a sham, and that in the\r\nsecond place we do not surrender our right and duty to prepare our own\r\nstrength for our own defense instead of trusting to the above-mentioned\r\nscraps of paper. In justification we point to certain very obvious\r\nfacts which ought to be patent to every man of common sense.\r\n\r\nAny such league of nations must, of course, include the nine nations\r\nwhich have the greatest military strength or it will be utterly\r\nimpotent. These nine nations include Germany, Austria, Turkey, and\r\nRussia. The first three have abundantly shown during the last four\r\nyears that no written or other promise of the most binding kind has\r\neven the slightest effect upon their actions. The fourth, Russia,\r\nunder the lead and dominion of the Bolsheviki, has just been guilty\r\nof the grossest possible betrayal of her allies and of the small\r\nkindred Slavonic peoples and of world democracy. This betrayal was in\r\nthe interest of a military and despotic autocracy and included the\r\ndirect violation of Russia’s plighted faith. Under such conditions it\r\nis unnecessary to say that Russia’s signature to any future league\r\nto enforce peace will not be worth the paper on which it is written.\r\nTherefore the creation of any such league for the future will simply\r\nmean a pledge by the present Allies to make their alliance perpetual\r\nand all to go to war again whenever one of them is attacked. This may\r\nbecome necessary, but it certainly does not imply future disarmament.\r\n\r\nNor is this all. The United States must come into court with clean\r\nhands. She must not pledge herself without reservation to the right\r\nof “self-determination” for each people while she has behaved toward\r\nHaiti and San Domingo as she is now behaving. It is not possible for\r\nme to say whether our action in these two cases has been right or\r\nwrong, because the Administration, with its usual horror of publicity,\r\nwhether pitiless or otherwise, and its inveterate predilection for\r\nsecret and furtive diplomacy, has kept most of the facts hidden. I\r\nbelieve that there was no possible excuse for such secret diplomacy in\r\nthese cases and that the same course should have been followed as was\r\nfollowed in the case of the Panama revolution, where every fact was\r\nimmediately laid without reservation before Congress. But even if I\r\nam wrong in my belief in the general principle of open diplomacy, and\r\neven if the Administration is right in its consistent policy of secret\r\ndiplomacy as regards the mass of questions which I think ought to be\r\nmade public, the fact remains that we have with armed force invaded,\r\nmade war upon, and conquered the two small republics, have upset\r\ntheir governments, have denied them the right of self-determination,\r\nand have made democracy within their limits not merely unsafe but\r\nnon-existent. As we have no published facts to go on, I cannot say\r\nwhether their misconduct did or did not warrant such drastic action on\r\nour part, but on the assumption that the Administration acted properly,\r\nwe are committed to the principle that some nations are not fit for\r\nself-determination, that democracy within their limits is a sham, and\r\nthat their offenses against justice and right are such as to render\r\ninterference by their more powerful and more civilized neighbors\r\nimperative. I do not doubt that this principle is true in some\r\ncases, whether or not it ought to be applied in these two particular\r\ncases. In any event, our continuing action in San Domingo and Haiti\r\nmakes it hypocritical for us to lay down any universal rules about\r\nself-determination for all nations.\r\n\r\nOur action also shows how utterly futile it would be to try to treat a\r\nleague to enforce peace as a substitute for training our own strength\r\nfor our own defense. Let China be the witness of the truth of this\r\nstatement. China has actually realized the ideal of the pacifists\r\nwho insist that unpreparedness for war secures peace. The ideal of\r\nthe internationalists is that patriotism and sense of nationalism\r\nare detrimental to humanity, and the ideal of the Socialists is that\r\nthe capitalist régime is the only cause of popular misery. China is\r\nhelpless to attack others or defend herself, her people have little\r\nsense of national unity and pride, and there are in China huge\r\ndistricts where there are no capitalists and where the misery of\r\nthe people is greater than in any country of the Occident. China’s\r\nhelplessness, instead of helping toward world peace, has been a\r\npositive encouragement to war and violence among her neighbors. Her\r\nfuture depends primarily, not on herself, but on what her neighbors\r\nchoose to do. In spite of her size and her enormous population and\r\nresources, she is helpless to do good to others because she is\r\npowerless to prevent others from doing evil to her. Her agreement to a\r\nleague of nations or to a league to enforce peace would be worthless,\r\nbecause she is unable to put strength back of justice either for\r\nherself or for any one else. The pacifists and internationalists if\r\nthey had their way would turn the United States into the China of the\r\nOccident.\r\n\r\nLet us put our trust neither in rhetoric nor hypocrisy, whether\r\nconscious or unconscious. Let us be honest with ourselves. Let us look\r\nthe truth in the face. Let us remember what Germany, Austria, and\r\nTurkey have actually done. Let us remember what Russia has suffered\r\nfrom Germany and the worse than folly with which she has behaved to\r\nevery one else. Let us remember what has happened to China and what we\r\nhave made happen to Haiti and San Domingo. Then let us trust for our\r\nsalvation to a sound and intense American nationalism.\r\n\r\nThe horse sense of the matter is that all agreements to further the\r\ncause of sound internationalism must be based on recognition of the\r\nfact that as the world is actually constituted our present prime need\r\nis this sound and intense American nationalism. The first essential\r\nof this sound nationalism is that the Nation shall trust to its own\r\nfully prepared strength for its own defense. So far as possible, its\r\nstrength must also be used to secure justice for others and must\r\nnever be used to wrong others. But unless we possess and prepare the\r\nstrength, we can neither help ourselves nor others. Let us by all means\r\ngo into any wise league or covenant among nations to abolish neutrality\r\n(for, of course, a league to enforce peace is merely another name for a\r\nleague to abolish neutrality in every possible war). But let us first\r\nunderstand what we are promising, and count the cost and determine\r\nto keep our promises. Above all, let us treat any such agreement or\r\ncovenant as a mere addition to, and never as a substitute for, the\r\npreparation in advance of our own armed power. Next time we behave with\r\nthe ignoble folly we have shown during the last four years we may not\r\nfind allies to do what France and England and Italy have done for us.\r\nThey have protected us with their navies and armies, their blood and\r\ntheir treasure, while we first refused to do anything and then slowly\r\nand reluctantly began to harden and make ready our giant but soft and\r\nlazy strength.\r\n\r\nNo proper scheme designed to secure peace without effort and safety\r\nwithout service and sacrifice will either make this country safe or\r\nenable it to do its international duty toward others.\r\n\r\nAn American citizen, personally unknown to me, writes me that his\r\nthree sons entered the army at the outbreak of the war, and that one\r\nof them, an aviator, was killed in battle at the front just two weeks\r\nbefore my own son was killed as he fought in the air. In his letter my\r\ncorrespondent adds:\r\n\r\n Would that my country might learn and never forget that not only\r\n the winning of peace now, but the maintenance of peace at all times\r\n depends not fundamentally on treaties or leagues of nations, but on\r\n the readiness of citizens to fly to the aid of the wronged and to give\r\n their lives if need be that justice may be secured.\r\n\r\nThere speaks the true American spirit which holds fast alike to\r\nfearlessness and to wisdom, to gentleness and to iron resolution.\r\nThere speaks the spirit of that fervent nationalism which would forbid\r\nAmerica either to inflict or to endure wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAN WHO PAYS AND THE MAN WHO PROFITS\r\n\r\nAUGUST 9, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThe men who do the fighting at the front and their mothers and\r\nwives back here are those who in this great and terrible crisis are\r\npaying--the blood of the men and the tears of the women, and with the\r\nsuffering of men, women, and children--for our failure to prepare\r\nduring the two and a half years before we entered the World War. For\r\nthis failure to prepare, in spite of the most vivid warning ever given\r\na Nation, the warning that befell the rest of the world during those\r\ntwo and a half years, the professed pacifists and the politicians who\r\npandered to them are more responsible than any one else, except the\r\npro-Germans. If, when the World War broke out, or at latest when the\r\nLusitania was sunk, we had done our plain duty, we had then begun to\r\nbuild ships, field cannon and airplanes, and to train men exactly as\r\nwe have been doing during the last year and a quarter, except that\r\nwe should have done the work on a larger scale with more efficiency\r\nand with much less waste and extravagance. Remember that failure to\r\nprovide great numbers of cannon and airplanes means that the infantry\r\nhas to pay for it with a huge increase of slaughter. All the guns and\r\nairplanes we left unbuilt during the first three years of the war\r\nhas meant so much more bloodshed, so many more Americans killed and\r\ncrippled, not to speak of the tremendous loss of life to our allies.\r\nMoreover, when men in small numbers are put into battle, when only a\r\nfew hundred thousand are forced to suffer heavy loss in doing work\r\nwhich two or three million men could have accomplished speedily and\r\nthoroughly and with very little loss, the responsibility rests on those\r\nwho prevented the preparation in advance. If we had built quantities of\r\nships and trained large numbers of men in advance, the World War would\r\nhave ended almost as soon as we entered, and an infinite amount of\r\nbloodshed would have been prevented.\r\n\r\nThe best roll of our army overseas is the American roll of honor. These\r\nmen have paid with their bodies for the safety of this Nation in the\r\npresent and the future. They have died, and by their death have earned\r\nfor the rest of us the right to hold our heads high with pride. But\r\nit is no less true that their blood has been shed, but their gallant\r\nlives have been spent because we did not prepare in advance. We did\r\nnot prepare because our people were misled. For this misleading of the\r\npeople the professional profiteers share the responsibility with the\r\npro-Germans, with sham sentimentalists, with the sordid, short-sighted\r\nmaterialists, and with all the politicians, publicists, and private\r\ncitizens, rich or poor, whose vanity or folly or self-interest profited\r\nthereby. We ought not to remember this in any spirit of revenge, but\r\nmost certainly, unless we are worse than foolish, we shall remember\r\nit and other warnings to teach us how to behave in the future, and as\r\na very stern warning against again trusting to the leadership of the\r\nmen thus responsible for the deaths of so many fine and fearless young\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nMost of the men who are misled, and some of the men who misled them,\r\nhave come frankly forward to admit their error. What is even more\r\nimportant, most of them have made the real atonement of deeds. They\r\nhave, if young, themselves gone into the army, and if not young have\r\nsent their sons or permitted them to go into the army and fight in\r\nfreedom’s belated battle. All these men are paying their share of\r\nthe joint payment in blood of the Nation. They are to be heartily\r\nrespected. They are not seeking to profit by the valor and blood of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nSo much for the men who pay; now for the men who profit. Some of these\r\nmen profit in money. If such profit is excessive it is iniquitous.\r\nBut a proper money profit is absolutely necessary, for no business\r\ncan be permanent without profit any more than a working-man can\r\npermanently work without wages. The unpardonable profit is that of\r\nthe man, especially the rich man, who, having preached pacifism and\r\nunpreparedness, now, when war comes, sees brave men face a death which\r\npacifism and unpreparedness have made infinitely more probable while\r\nhe himself and his sons profit by these other men’s courage and sit at\r\nhome in the ease and safety secured by the fact that these others face\r\ndeath. The worst profiteers in this country are the men and the sons of\r\nthe men who decline to face the death which their own actions have made\r\nmore probable for others.\r\n\r\nUnless in exceptional cases there is no need to discuss individuals\r\nin private life. But when a man seeks public office, it becomes a\r\nduty to discuss his record. Mr. Henry Ford is a candidate for United\r\nStates Senator in Michigan. No man in this country strove harder in\r\nthe cause of pacifism and unpreparedness than he did during the vital\r\ntwo years and a half before this country went to War. He received\r\nthe cordial applause of the peace-at-any-price people who were\r\nthemselves, of course, efficiently playing the pro-German game. He is\r\na multi-millionaire. If any of his kin are killed, their families are\r\nnot merely guarded against poverty, but are sure of wealth. The son of\r\nMr. Ford ought to feel it absolutely obligatory on him to go to the\r\nwar. There is not in this country any other man who ought to feel it\r\nmore honorably necessary to pay with his body, if necessary, to atone\r\nwith his life for the dreadful wrong done this country by the preachers\r\nof pacifism and unpreparedness during the two years and a half that\r\npreceded our entry into the war. Yet it is announced in the press that\r\nMr. Ford’s son has obtained exemption from military service and is\r\nemployed in the money-making business of his wealthy father.\r\n\r\nMr. Ford’s proper place is on the mourner’s bench and not at the\r\ncouncil board of the Nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR DEBT TO THE BRITISH EMPIRE\r\n\r\nAUGUST 16, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge Ben Lindsey has recently written two or three striking\r\npieces about what Great Britain has done and is doing in this war.\r\nIncidentally he points out how far ahead of us she now is in certain\r\ntypes of social legislation, such as that dealing with children. But\r\nthe lesson he inculcates which is of most immediate concern is the\r\ngiant part England has played in this war and the debt we owe to\r\nher because, in standing up for Belgium and France, she was really\r\ndefending us during our days of folly when we followed the lead of our\r\nworst enemies, the pacifists and pro-Germans.\r\n\r\nThe English pacifists are, if anything, even more silly than our own.\r\nThey did their best to make England keep out of this war. If they had\r\nsucceeded the British Empire would for a few years have trod the broad,\r\nsmooth road of peaceful and greedy infamy and would then have tumbled\r\ninto the bottomless pit of utter destruction. But in August, 1914,\r\nGreat Britain and the gallant overseas commonwealths which share her\r\nempire chose the hard path of immediate danger, of ultimate safety, and\r\nof high heroism. Thereby they saved their own souls and the bodies of\r\ntheir children, and in so doing rendered an inestimable service to us.\r\n\r\nEngland has raised an immense army which has fought in Europe, Asia,\r\nand Africa. If it were not for this army even the highly trained valor\r\nof the French could not have averted German victory. At the same time\r\nthe British fleet has kept the seas free for the food and coal and\r\nmunitions needed for the Allied people and armies and has furnished\r\nthe transports necessary to enable us to put under Pershing a force\r\nlarge enough to be of real consequence in the vitally important battle\r\nwhich has been raging for the last thirty days. If Great Britain had\r\nnot been far-sighted enough to realize what her own welfare demanded\r\nwhen France was invaded, and if she had not been stirred to noble\r\nindignation by the Belgian horror, the whole civilized world would now\r\nhave been cowering under the brutal dominion of Germany. If she had not\r\ncontrolled the seas, not an American battalion could have been sent\r\nto the aid of France as she struggled to save the soul of the world,\r\nand no help could have been given gallant Italy or any others of these\r\nAllied nations to whose stern fighting efficiency we owe it that this\r\nearth is still a place on which free men can live.\r\n\r\nWe must stand by Great Britain precisely as we stand by our other\r\nallies--in the first place, by waging the war with all our strength,\r\nand in the next place by seeing that the peace is of a kind which\r\njustifies them for all the sacrifices they have made.\r\n\r\nOne item in waging the war ought to be insistence that every American\r\nof fighting age who resides in the British Empire and every Englishman\r\nof fighting age who resides in the United States be invariably put in\r\neither the British or the American armies. One item in making peace\r\nought to be insistence that Britain keep every colony she has conquered\r\nfrom Germany, both in the South Seas and in Africa. Germany has behaved\r\nabominably in Africa. The course Germany has followed in Africa has\r\nmade her a menace of evil to the Boer and British Africanders, and to\r\nreturn to her the colonies which have been taken from her, whether in\r\nAfrica or Asia, by Australia or Great Britain, or by France or Japan or\r\nBelgium, would be a crime against civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CANDIDACY OF HENRY FORD\r\n\r\nAUGUST 20, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery loyal American citizen in Michigan should read the last two\r\nnumbers of Mr. George Harvey’s War Weekly. In these numbers there are\r\nquotations from Mr. Henry Ford’s speeches made two years ago and again\r\nsince we entered the war. Mr. Ford has not questioned the accuracy of\r\nthese quotations given by Mr. Harvey.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of American flags over his own factory Mr. Ford said: “I don’t\r\nbelieve in the flag. When the war is over these flags shall come down\r\nnever to go up again.”\r\n\r\nThe Sedition Act, approved by President Wilson, inflicts a maximum\r\npunishment of twenty years in the penitentiary for any man who, while\r\nwe are at war, utters “language intended to bring the flag of the\r\nUnited States into contempt or disrepute.” During the last year many\r\npoor and ignorant men have been convicted and sentenced for using\r\nlanguage thus forbidden by law. In my view the fact that Mr. Ford is\r\nan enormously wealthy man ought not to give him immunity from the law\r\nif he cannot show that he did not use the language quoted in the War\r\nWeekly. But whether or not amenable to the law, no patriotic American\r\ncan afford to put in the Senate, perhaps to help negotiate the peace\r\ntreaty, a man who announces that as soon as peace comes he wishes to\r\nhaul down the American flag and never again to hoist it. To send such a\r\nman to the Senate professing such sentiments under existing conditions\r\nwould give the enemy a wholly wrong idea of the pacifist sentiment in\r\nour country. There is nothing in the world which would now help Germany\r\nas much, or give her so much heart in her struggle for the overthrow of\r\nliberty and democracy as the belief that men professing such sentiments\r\nwould have part in the peace negotiations on behalf of this country.\r\n\r\nAmong the further utterances of Mr. Ford (as given in the War Weekly)\r\nis one that he does “not believe in patriotism” and that he does not\r\ncare any more for the United States “than for China or Hindustan.”\r\nThe man who does not believe in patriotism is not fit to live in this\r\ncountry, still less to represent it in the Senate. If these words of\r\nMr. Ford mean anything, then Mr. Ford is unpatriotic and has no more\r\nright to sit in the United States Senate than a Hindu or a Chinaman.\r\nUnless Mr. Ford can show that he never uttered these words no man\r\nworthy to be called an American, and least of all any religious or\r\npatriotic man, can afford to support him for the Senate.\r\n\r\nMr. Ford has been given immensely valuable war contracts of the\r\nGovernment. No doubt he has executed them as well as the thousands\r\nof other contractors who now render service to the Government for\r\npay. But no service he can thus render the Government can offset the\r\nfrightful damage he did our people by the lavish use he made of his\r\nenormous wealth in a gigantic and profoundly anti-American propaganda\r\nagainst preparedness and against our performance of international duty\r\nduring the two and a half years before we entered the war. This crusade\r\nagainst righteousness included the sending of the ridiculous “peace\r\nship” to Europe. This particular manifestation was too absurd even to\r\ndo harm, but so far as it had any effect at all it encouraged Germany\r\nto believe that we were as neutral between right and wrong as Pontius,\r\nand that as far as we were concerned she could safely proceed with\r\nwrongdoing because we held the scales of judgment even between the\r\nwrongdoer and his victim. The crusade also included an extraordinary\r\nseries of advertisements issued long after the Lusitania was sunk, in\r\nwhich Mr. Ford violently opposed and denounced preparedness, advocated\r\nand approved the McLemore resolutions, and announced that it was our\r\nduty to keep out of war; and not merely himself kept silent about the\r\nwrongdoing of Germany, but assailed those who set forth this wrongdoing\r\non the ground that they “had bred racial hatred by the printing of\r\nincendiary news stories and articles.” It may well be doubted whether\r\nthis propaganda did not do more damage to the American people than the\r\npropaganda carried on at the same time by Ambassador Bernstorff.\r\n\r\nIf we had seen our duty and had fully prepared during these two and a\r\nhalf years, either we would never have had to enter the war or we would\r\nhave brought it to a close immediately after we entered it. The best\r\nand bravest of the young men of the Nation are now paying with their\r\nblood for our unpreparedness and therefore for the pacific propaganda\r\nquite as much as for the pro-German propaganda carried on in this\r\ncountry during the two and a half years before we entered the war. But\r\nwealthy Mr. Ford’s son is not among these men. He is of draft age. He\r\napplied for exemption. The local board refused his application. He\r\napplied to the President. The President did not act for two months.\r\nThen the revised draft regulations were promulgated, and Mr. Ford was\r\nexcepted under the deferred or exempted class which included a married\r\nman with a child, however wealthy that man might be. He has exercised\r\nhis legal right. Very many thousands of young Americans, men of small\r\nmeans who are not sons of multi-millionaires, have declined to take\r\nadvantage of this legal right. They have left their wives and babies to\r\ngo to war for a great ideal, for love of country, for love of liberty\r\nand of civilization. But Mr. Ford’s son stays at home. These other\r\nyoung Americans face death and endure unspeakable hardships and misery\r\nand fatigue for the sake of America and have surrendered all hope of\r\nmoney-getting, of comfort and of safety. But young Mr. Ford, in ease\r\nand safety, is in the employ of his wealthy father.\r\n\r\nIn private relations I understand that Mr. Ford is an amiable man. But\r\nI am not dealing with him in his private relations. I am discussing him\r\nas a candidate for high office. We are bound truthfully to set forth\r\nwhat we believe will be the effect of his election, and therefore we\r\nare bound to say that it would be damaging to the United States and\r\nwould be encouraging to Germany. No patriotic American should support\r\nMr. Ford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEED UP THE WORK FOR THE ARMY AND GIVE ALL WHO ENTER IT FAIR PLAY\r\n\r\nAUGUST 23, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Government must learn that needless delay is worse than a blunder.\r\nWe are sending troops to Siberia. This is good, but it would have\r\nbeen ten times better to have sent them last spring when the need was\r\nprecisely as evident as it is now. The Administration is now preparing\r\nto ask Congress to arrange for putting between three and four million\r\nmen in France by next July. Six months ago our best military advisers\r\nand our most far-sighted civilian leaders were urging that we prepare\r\nto put five million men in France by next March. The delay has been\r\nabsolutely needless and may be very harmful. When last spring the\r\ndemand for five million men was being incessantly urged, President\r\nWilson treated it as merely a case for competitive rhetoric, and asked,\r\nwith dramatic effect, why we should limit the number at all. But he\r\nactually has limited it to a much smaller number at a much later date.\r\nTherefore let there at least be no further delay. And above all let\r\nus not be misled by the persons who say that Germany will make peace\r\nbefore next spring. Our business is to act on the assumption that we\r\nshall have to put forth our utmost effort next spring and not to take\r\nany unnecessary chances.\r\n\r\nThe Government is now very properly proposing to enlarge the draft age\r\nlimits to include all the men of fighting age, all the men of the ages\r\nwhich furnished the enormous majority of the soldiers of the Civil War.\r\nThe number of men in the excepted classes should be greatly reduced.\r\nThere are too many exceptions. It is earnestly to be hoped that the\r\nplan will include the institution of universal obligatory military\r\ntraining of all our young men of eighteen to twenty years old as a\r\npermanent policy.\r\n\r\nBut we ought not to adopt the plan recently proposed for special\r\nadvantages to be given by the Government to young men who go to college\r\nand take certain special courses with a view to becoming officers. This\r\nwould amount to giving a special privilege to persons with money enough\r\nto send their boys to college in order to have them escape the draft\r\nand secure commissions. This is not fair. It means giving a privilege\r\nto money. There is no excuse for giving such a preference to young men\r\nof eighteen or nineteen at this time when we have been at war eighteen\r\nmonths. There is still need to give some of the older men a special\r\nchance to train. But there is no such need in the case of men under\r\ntwenty-one.\r\n\r\nThere was every reason of sound public policy at the outset of the\r\nwar to take advantage of the forethought and self-denial of the young\r\nmen who at the Plattsburg and similar camps had at their own expense\r\nprepared themselves before the war began, and when, owing to the\r\nfailure of the Government to do its duty, they were the only men who\r\ndid prepare. There has been good reason for similar camps for young men\r\nduring the last eighteen months before our general training camps began\r\nto show their full results. But from now on every young officer should\r\nbe chosen on his merits from the men who enter the army in the ranks.\r\nOnly the men who show their fitness, by whatever tests are deemed\r\nnecessary after service in the ranks, should be sent to officers’\r\nschools, and money should play no part whatever in the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSENATOR LODGE’S NOBLE SPEECH\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 1, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nSenator Lodge’s speech dealing with the principles for which we are\r\nfighting and setting forth in detailed outline the kind of peace which\r\nalone will mean the peace of victory was a really noble speech. Nothing\r\nis easier, and from the national standpoint as distinguished from the\r\nstandpoint of personal benefit to the speaker, nothing is less useful\r\nthan a speech of such glittering generalities that almost anybody can\r\ninterpret it in almost any manner. Only a great statesman possesses the\r\ncourage, the knowledge, and the power of expression to set forth in\r\nconvincing fashion the detailed statement of the objects which must be\r\nattained if such a war as that in which we are engaged is to be crowned\r\nby a peace wholly worth the terrible cost of life and happiness caused\r\nby the war. This is the service which Senator Lodge has rendered to\r\nthis Nation and to our allies.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time in our history the Senate has rendered services\r\nof exceptional magnitude to the Nation. Never in our history has it\r\nrendered greater service than during the last nine months. The greatest\r\nmen who have ever sat in it, men such as Clay and Webster and Calhoun\r\nand Benton, did not stand forth in leadership more clearly than a\r\ndozen of the Senators who, during the last nine months, have fearlessly\r\nand disinterestedly borne the burden of speeding up the war and\r\nendeavoring to place our international relations on exactly the right\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nThese leaders have in actual fact adjourned politics. They have\r\nconsidered only their patriotic duty in all matters concerning this war\r\nand our relations with our allies and our enemies. The most efficient\r\nservice toward speeding up the war and enabling this Nation to do its\r\nduty that has been rendered by any civilian public servants of the\r\nNation is the service rendered by Senator Chamberlain and the Senators,\r\nboth Democrats and Republicans, who acted with him on the Military\r\nAffairs Committee in the investigation of the War Department last\r\nwinter. Within the last fortnight a service of similar character has\r\nbeen rendered by Senator Thomas and his associates in both parties on\r\nthe sub-committee which has at last put before the people the truth\r\nabout the breakdown of our aircraft programme. The fact that this\r\nsummer we have put masses of armed men into France is primarily due to\r\nSenator Chamberlain and the Senators of both parties who have acted\r\nwith him. The fact that next summer we shall at last back up American\r\ntroops with American airplanes will be due primarily to Senator Thomas\r\nand his associates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLIED PATRIOTISM\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 8, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThe official record of the Illinois branch of the United Mine Workers\r\nof America furnishes an instructive lesson in applied patriotism.\r\nThe president of the branch is Mr. Frank Farrington. The United Mine\r\nWorkers are affiliated with the American Federation of Labor.\r\n\r\nPresident Farrington’s circulars to the Illinois mine workers set\r\nforth the need and the justice of this war and the duty of patriotic\r\nAmericans in the most straightforward and clear-cut fashion. He\r\nstates that this is the war for liberty and humanity and for American\r\nrights, and that there rests “upon every American and upon every man\r\nwho has partaken of America’s bounty the solemn obligation of loyally\r\ndoing their part to win victory for the cause America represents.” He\r\npromises the mine workers that their rights shall be protected and\r\nsecured, but insists that they shall lend every energy to increase the\r\noutput of coal so as to help our army at the front, which, as he finely\r\nsays, includes “sons of the rich and sons of the poor men who love life\r\nas one, but who prefer death to life without liberty and who have made\r\ncommon cause and entered the lists in answer to the Nation’s need.”\r\n\r\nThe improper practices are specifically pointed out and condemned,\r\nsuch as shutting down mines in violation of agreement in order to\r\nforce some desired condition, or making improper restrictions to\r\ncurtail production. The appeal is solemnly made to, and on behalf\r\nof, the miners’ union that there must be full service to the Nation\r\nand no shirking of duty, and that no agreement into which the union\r\nenters shall be treated as a scrap of paper, but shall be in good\r\nfaith fulfilled. President Farrington in his official circulars lays\r\nconstantly increasing stress upon the seriousness of the obligation\r\nresting upon the miners to aid and sustain the Allied armies in\r\ntheir fight for the freedom of humanity by hard, steady work and by\r\nincreasing the output of coal. He condemns with genuine loftiness of\r\nfeeling and expression all who fail to give the utmost help to the men\r\nwho at the front are doing so much and suffering so much.\r\n\r\nThe Illinois mine workers number about ninety thousand members. They\r\nare divided into three hundred and twenty local unions. Of these I\r\nhave figures from only one hundred and twenty. They have sent over\r\nfour thousand men into the army and navy of the United States, have\r\npurchased over two million dollars’ worth of Liberty bonds, $700,000 of\r\nWar Savings Stamps, and have contributed over $90,000 to the Red Cross\r\nand over $20,000 to other war funds.\r\n\r\nThe Illinois mine workers have made a fine showing in applied\r\npatriotism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOD LUCK TO THE ANTI-BOLSHEVISTS OF KANSAS\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 12, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThe absolute prerequisite for successful self-government in any\r\npeople is the power of self-restraint which refuses to follow either\r\nthe wild-eyed extremists of radicalism or the dull-eyed extremists\r\nof reaction. Either set of extremists will wreck the Nation just as\r\ncertainly as the other. The Nation capable of self-government must\r\nshow the Abraham Lincoln quality of refusing to go with either. The\r\ndreadful fall which has befallen Russia is due to the fact that when\r\nher people cast off the tyranny of the autocracy, they did not have\r\nsufficient self-control and common sense to avoid rushing into the gulf\r\nof Bolshevist anarchy.\r\n\r\nIn this country there are plenty of highbrow Bolsheviki who like to\r\nthink of themselves as intellectuals, and who in parlors and at pink\r\nteas preach Bolshevism as a fad. They are fatuously ignorant that it\r\nmay be a dangerous fad. Some of them are mere make-believe, sissy\r\nBolsheviki, almost or quite harmless. Others are sincere and foolish\r\nfanatics, who mean well and who do not realize that their doctrines\r\ntend toward moral disintegration. But there are practical Bolsheviki\r\nin this country who are in no sense highbrows. The I.W.W. and the\r\nNon-Partisan League, just as long and so far as its members submit\r\nto the dominion of leaders like Mr. Townley, represent the forces\r\nthat under Lenine and Trotzky have brought ruin to Russia. If these\r\norganizations obtained power here, they would cast this country into\r\nthe same abyss with Russia.\r\n\r\nThe I.W.W. activities may have been officially set forth by the Chicago\r\njury which found the I.W.W. leaders guilty of treasonable practices.\r\nThese leaders protested that they were only trying to help “the wage\r\nslave of to-day,” and had not taken German money. But the jury found\r\nthem guilty as charged. The American people, when fully awake and\r\naroused, will tolerate neither treason nor anarchy. No Americans are\r\nmore patriotic than the honest American labor men, and these above all\r\nhad cause to rejoice in the verdict. Undoubtedly there are plenty of\r\npoor ignorant men who join the I.W.W. because they feel they do not\r\nreceive justice. We should all of us actively unite in the effort to\r\nright any wrongs from which these men suffer. But we should set our\r\nfaces like flint against such criminal leadership as that of the I.W.W.\r\n\r\nThe Non-Partisan League endeavored to ally itself with the I.W.W. since\r\nwe entered the war. When the League was started, I felt much sympathy\r\nwith its avowed purposes. I hope for and shall welcome wisely radical\r\naction on behalf of the farmer. But only destruction to all of us can\r\ncome from the venomous class hatred preached by the present leadership\r\nof the League. Some of its leaders have been convicted and imprisoned\r\nfor treasonable activities. Some of the League’s representatives have\r\nbeen actively pro-Germans. Some are Socialists or Socialist-Anarchists.\r\nFor the first six months of the war and until it became too dangerous,\r\nthey were openly against the war, against our allies, and for Germany.\r\nThe only half-secret alliance between these leaders and certain high\r\nDemocratic politicians is deeply discreditable to the latter. The\r\nvictory of the League in its recent efforts to gain control of the\r\nRepublican Party in Minnesota and Montana would have given immense\r\nstrength to the pro-German and Bolshevist element throughout the\r\ncountry and its defeat was a matter of rejoicing to all right-minded\r\nand patriotic men.\r\n\r\nMr. Townley’s leadership in its moral purpose and national effect\r\nentitles him to rank with Messrs. Lenine and Trotzky, and the\r\nutterances of the League’s official organ, especially in its appeals to\r\nclass hatred, puts the official representatives of the League squarely\r\nin the clan with the Bolshevist leaders who have done such evil in\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nI have before me an official letter from the League written in January\r\nlast refusing to coöperate in non-political work for the benefit of the\r\nfarmers, saying, “This organization is a political one, the farmers\r\nbeing organized for the purpose of controlling legislation in their\r\nown interests.” In other words, the title, Non-Partisan, is a piece\r\nof pure hypocrisy, and its league is really partisan in the narrowest\r\nand worst sense. Americans should organize politically as Americans\r\nand not as bankers, or lawyers, or farmers, or wage-workers. To\r\norganize politically on the basis adopted by the League is thoroughly\r\nanti-American and unpatriotic, and if copied generally by our citizens,\r\nwould mean the creation in this country of rival political parties\r\nbased on cynically brutal class selfishness.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that the rank and file of the members of the League\r\nare good, honest people who have been misled. I am certain that\r\nthere has been much neglect of the rights of the farmers and that it\r\nis a high duty for this country to begin a constructive, practical\r\nagricultural policy. But no good American can support the League while\r\nit is dominated by its present leadership. The Kansans who have joined\r\nto fight the League because it represents Bolshevism are rendering a\r\npatriotic service to America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH LIBERTY LOAN\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 17, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States is asking us Americans, is asking\r\nus, the citizens of the United States, to subscribe to the Fourth\r\nLiberty Loan, a bigger loan than any yet issued. It is our duty to back\r\nup the Government by floating the loan. Moreover, the performance of\r\nthis duty should be treated by us as a high privilege. It opens to us\r\na fine opportunity to put our shoulders with all the strength we have\r\ninto the great shove which is pushing the German barrier back across\r\nthe Rhine.\r\n\r\nThe Liberty bonds are the best of all possible investments. Their\r\nsecurity and their interest returns give them a peculiar position.\r\nMoreover, every one can invest in big or little amounts, exactly as\r\nhis resources permit. All the people of this country can now become\r\nbondholders if they wish. Therefore, all investors in the bonds will\r\nget benefits, but what is vastly more important, they will give\r\nbenefits. They will therefore render service to the country.\r\n\r\nWe Americans are not, and must not permit ourselves to become, swayed\r\nby question of material gain in this war. We must think primarily of\r\nour duties. We must keep our minds fixed on what we owe to others, and\r\nwhat we owe to ourselves. We owe a service to humanity. Our sons and\r\nbrothers at the front pay this service in blood. The rest of us must\r\npay it in money.\r\n\r\nCommensurate with the great resources and unparalleled prosperity with\r\nwhich our Nation has been blessed, we owe all the more because for\r\nthree years the debt accumulated, while other nations were bearing the\r\nburden for us. We thank God we have begun to pay. From every village\r\nand city of every state the best of our young men are streaming across\r\nthe Atlantic to join the victorious army under Foch and Pershing. The\r\nmen and women of America are keeping mill and shipyard and munition\r\nfactory and mine busy to the limit, so that the troops may not fail nor\r\nthe supplies on which they depend be lacking.\r\n\r\nAll this is not one whit more than we ought to do; it is what we owe\r\nto the world and owe to ourselves. We are glad and proud to do it.\r\nLet us, as part payment of our great debt, subscribe and oversubscribe\r\nto the bonds of the Fourth Liberty Loan. This is a service which lies\r\nwithin the ability of the poorest of us. It is the duty and privilege\r\nof every right American. Every dollar put into Liberty loans is a\r\ndollar working for the downfall of the system of greed and treachery,\r\nof tyranny and callous brutality which has drenched the world in blood.\r\n\r\nAmericans are not quitters. The Kaiser’s troops cannot stop our men at\r\nthe front. Nothing must be permitted to stop the flow into the treasury\r\nof the money with which we back up these men. Sloth and easy living\r\nhave no place in America now. We must give, give to the utmost. If\r\nputting our money at the disposal of the Government requires us to work\r\nharder and live more simply, we shall be the better for it. Let us buy\r\nthese Liberty bonds to the utmost of our capacity and thereby show the\r\nmen at the front that the people at home will back them to the limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAIR PLAY AND NO POLITICS\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 20, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nA Democratic member of the Senate has introduced a resolution to\r\ninvestigate the primary campaign expenses of certain Republican\r\ncandidates for the Senate, including Commander Truman Newberry,\r\nwhose recent triumph over Mr. Henry Ford in the Michigan Republican\r\nprimaries was greeted with heartfelt thanks by every sincere and\r\nfar-sighted American patriot.\r\n\r\nThis Senate, which comes to an end on March 4 next, has the same, and\r\nonly the same right to investigate the election conduct of candidates\r\nfor the Senate, which comes into existence on March 4 that it has to\r\ninvestigate the campaign conduct of any other candidates for office.\r\n\r\nMoreover, any such proposed investigation undertaken on the eve of\r\nan election is tainted with bad faith unless it is conducted with\r\nconspicuous fairness and impartiality and is undertaken at once so that\r\nit can be finished at least a month before the elections. Personally,\r\nI shall be glad if the election expenses or any other conduct of any\r\nof the candidates be investigated, provided that the investigation be\r\nundertaken at once and finished within the next fortnight, and provided\r\nthat it be entirely impartial. Therefore, it must deal comprehensively\r\nwith all serious charges affecting the desirability of candidates as\r\ngovernmental representatives of the American people at this time.\r\n\r\nIf the men backing the proposal are acting in good faith they will\r\ninvestigate Mr. Ford’s record on the following points in order to\r\ndetermine his fitness to represent patriotic Americans at this time.\r\nThey will find out how much money he spent on the peace ship, and\r\non his lavishly expensive newspaper advertising campaign against\r\npreparedness, and against our standing up for Belgium’s rights, and\r\nagainst our taking action about Germany’s sinking the Lusitania and\r\nher other assaults on us, and in favor of the McLemore resolution. This\r\nwas part of the great pacifist campaign of which another part, as our\r\ngovernment investigations show, was financed by the German authorities\r\nthemselves or by their affiliated societies in this country.\r\n\r\nThe investigation should include Mr. Ford’s contributions in the last\r\npresidential campaign and the names of the candidates he supported, for\r\nhis politics seem to have been purely personal and pacifist.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the investigation should include a full examination of the\r\njustification for Mr. Ford’s aiding and abetting his son Edsell in\r\nescaping draft and staying at home when the great majority of young\r\nAmericans of his age are eagerly striving for places of honor and peril\r\nat the front. Mr. Ford is an enormously wealthy man. Mr. Newberry is\r\nnot. Mr. Newberry himself at once entered the military service of\r\nthe United States. His two sons have wives and children, but they\r\nimmediately entered the service, striving eagerly to get to the front.\r\nMr. Edsell Ford waited until he was drafted, then fought hard for an\r\nexemption, which the local board disallowed. He succeeded, however, in\r\nescaping service and is at home.\r\n\r\nUnless the investigation takes up these matters, it will be stamped\r\nwith the stamp of unworthy and improper partisanship. The simple truth\r\nis that all patriotic Americans rejoice in the nomination and will\r\nrejoice in the election at this time of such Americans as Mr. Newberry\r\nin Michigan and Mr. Medill McCormick in Illinois.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPIES AND SLACKERS\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 24, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nMercy to the German spy or pacifist slacker in America is foul\r\ninjustice to the American soldier in France and to his brother, who\r\nis preparing to go to France. Our Government has been altogether too\r\nweak in dealing with the pacifist slackers and so-called conscientious\r\nobjectors. It has actually issued elaborate instructions for and to\r\nthese creatures practically telling them how to escape doing the duty\r\nwhich all patriotic Americans are proudly eager to perform.\r\n\r\nThere is not the slightest excuse for such weakness. No man has any\r\nright to remain in a free country like ours if he refuses, whether\r\nconscientiously or unconscientiously, to do the duties of peace and of\r\nwar which are necessary if it is to be kept free. The true lovers of\r\npeace recognize their duty to fight for freedom. The Society of Friends\r\nhas furnished the same large proportion of soldiers for this war that\r\nit did for the Civil War.\r\n\r\nIt is all wrong to permit conscientious objectors to remain in camp or\r\nmilitary posts or to go back to their homes. They should be treated\r\nin one of three ways: First, demand of them military service, except\r\nthe actual use of weapons with intent to kill, and if they refuse\r\nto render this service treat them as criminals and imprison them at\r\nhard labor; second, put them in labor battalions and send them to\r\nFrance behind the lines, where association with soldiers might have a\r\nmissionary effect on them and cause them to forget their present base\r\ncreed and rise to worthy levels in an atmosphere of self-sacrifice and\r\nof service and struggle for great ideals; third, if both of the above\r\nprocedures are regarded as too drastic, intern them with alien enemies\r\nand send them permanently out of the country as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nAs for the spies, there is no question as to the treatment needed. They\r\nshould be shot or hung. They are public enemies and this is war-time\r\nand they should no more be dealt with by the civil law than the enemy\r\narmies should be so dealt with. The German spies and secret agents\r\nand dynamiters and murderers in this country are as much a part of\r\nGermany as the soldiers of von Hindenburg. Bismarck employed thirty\r\nthousand of them to disorganize Germany’s foes fifty years ago, and\r\nnow Germany is employing them by the hundred thousand. They are as\r\nformidable as the visible German army. It was these German Spies,\r\nagents, and propagandists who, in 1917, disintegrated and destroyed\r\nRussia, and inflicted a crushing disaster on Italy, and conducted the\r\nmost dangerous intrigue in France, and aided and abetted the British\r\npacifists.\r\n\r\nIn this country Senator Overman has estimated their number at four\r\nhundred thousand, and Mr. Flynn, the recently resigned chief of the\r\nsecret service, has put them at a quarter of a million. Our official\r\ngovernment reports have shown that in obedience to orders from the\r\nGerman Government they have carried on in all hostile and even neutral\r\ncountries a systematic warfare by means of aiding pacifists’ movements,\r\ninciting strikes, fomenting disloyalty, and employing direct action\r\ndynamiters and murderers. They have received aid and coöperation,\r\nconscientiously and unconscientiously, by many evils in pacifist\r\nand Bolshevist societies and in organizations like the I.W.W. and\r\nNon-Partisan League.\r\n\r\nThe activities of the German spies, agents, and sympathizers vary from\r\nmere disloyal utterances, which the Attorney-General of the United\r\nStates has stated to be the cause of most of the disorder in the\r\ncountry, up to seeking to corrupt our soldiers and practicing sabotage\r\nin our munitions works and factories for war materials. All offenders\r\nof the latter type, wherever committed, can, under the existing law,\r\nbe tried by court-martial and executed, and this is the proper course\r\nto follow. It was the course followed under Lincoln’s administration,\r\nwhich is one of the reasons why Lincoln’s administration differed so\r\nmarkedly from Buchanan’s.\r\n\r\nThe former chief of the secret service says that there are a quarter\r\nof a million of these German spies and agents in this country. We\r\nhave ample law to warrant these being punished with death by summary\r\ncourt-martial, under military law as military enemies. We have been at\r\nwar eighteen months, but not one Spy has thus been punished. This means\r\ngrave remissness in the performance of our duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUIT PLAYING FAVORITES\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 30, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is announced that the young men of eighteen or nineteen included in\r\nthe draft will be sent free to college by the Government and will there\r\nbe given the chance to earn commissions and escape service in the ranks.\r\n\r\nEither this represents sheer deception or it will mean gross\r\nfavoritism. We now have plenty of young men who have been serving in\r\nthe ranks for nearly eighteen months. Scores of thousands of these left\r\ncollege to go or had just finished high school when they went. All\r\nthese boys, whether they have or have not been to college, are entitled\r\nto the first chance for commissions on equal terms with one another,\r\nexcept that preference should be given those who have been engaged in\r\nthe fighting overseas. Almost all the second lieutenancies should now\r\nbe filled in this manner by promotion from the ranks. To give to boys\r\nnow about to enter college the preference over those who have actually\r\nserved in the ranks, and especially over those who have actually faced\r\ndeath overseas, would be a cruel injustice.\r\n\r\nBut the injustice would be equally great among the new recruits\r\nthemselves. It is wholly illusory for the Government to say it will\r\nsend to college all who wish to go. The average working-man or small\r\nfarmer has not had money enough to educate his son so that the boy can\r\nnow enter college without further training. Yet that boy may have in\r\nhim the qualities of leadership which especially fit him for command.\r\nSuch a working-man or farmer ought to wish, and does wish, that his\r\nson be tested on his merits by actual service in the ranks, alongside\r\nof all other boys, no favors being shown either him or them. For the\r\nGovernment at this time to send some of these boys to college and thus\r\ngive them a start over the bulk of their fellows represents privilege\r\ngiven to money and is thoroughly unfair.\r\n\r\nFor the two years before we entered the war the only important piece\r\nof preparedness was that of the men who at their own expense went to\r\nthe Plattsburg training camp established by General Wood, and when\r\nGermany forced us into war it was imperatively necessary at once to\r\nestablish many additional camps of this kind or we should have had no\r\nofficers whatever for our army. It is still advisable to keep a few\r\ntraining camps for older men whose age and qualifications especially\r\nfit them for certain kinds of service. But it is not wise nor right for\r\nthe Government now to put certain especially favored classes of boys\r\nof eighteen and nineteen into college with a view to giving them an\r\nadvantage over their fellows. This is undemocratic. It is not fair to\r\nthe other boys of their age who are not in the army. It is exceedingly\r\nunfair and unjust to the young men who are already enlisted in the\r\narmy, and especially to those who have seen service overseas.\r\n\r\nFrom now on no young officer should be appointed saving after service\r\nin the ranks out of which he is chosen by fair test in comparison with\r\nhis fellows as fit to enter an officers’ training camp. Moreover,\r\nthere should be a resolute effort to give preference to the men who\r\nhave served in the front in France, the very men who are now apt to be\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR AIMS AND PEACE PROPOSALS\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 12, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nOur war aim ought to be unconditional surrender of Germany and of her\r\nvassal allies, Austria and Turkey. We ought not to consider any peace\r\nproposals from Germany until this war aim has been accomplished by the\r\nvictorious arms of our allies and ourselves.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that the Central Powers show a greedy eagerness to\r\naccept the so-called “fourteen points” laid down by President Wilson. I\r\nearnestly hope that when the time for discussing peace proposals comes,\r\nwe shall ourselves repudiate some of these fourteen points, and that we\r\nshall insist on having all of them put into plain and straightforward\r\nlanguage before we assent to any of them. Let us remember that Congress\r\nshares with the President the right to make treaties and that the\r\npeople are bound to insist that they, the people, are the ultimate\r\narbiters and that their will in the peace treaty is followed by both\r\nthe President and the Congress.\r\n\r\nFor example, what does that one of the fourteen points referring to the\r\nfreedom of the seas mean? If it means what Germany interprets it to\r\nmean, then every decent American ought to be against it. The kind of\r\nfreedom of the seas upon which it is really vital to count is freedom\r\nfrom murder. International law at present condemns exactly the kind\r\nof murder which Germany practiced in the case of the Lusitania and in\r\nhundreds of other cases, and is still practicing. We ought to make her\r\natone heavily for such conduct and explicitly renounce it before we\r\never discuss any other kind of freedom of the seas.\r\n\r\nAgain, we ought to know just what the President means by freedom of\r\ncommercial intercourse. If he means that he proposes to allow Germany\r\nto dump her manufactures on us without restriction, we ought to be\r\nagainst it. We ought to insist on keeping in our hands the complete\r\nright to handle our tariff as the vital interests of our own citizens,\r\nand especially our own working-men, demand.\r\n\r\nAgain, what is meant by the league of nations? If it means that\r\nGermany, Austria, Turkey, and Russia, as at present constituted, are to\r\nhave the say-so about America’s future destiny, we ought to be against\r\nit. They would treat any agreement with us as a scrap of paper wherever\r\nit suited their interests, and we ought to realize this fact. Moreover,\r\nwe already belong to a _de facto_ league of nations which is a going\r\nconcern. Let us stand by our allies before entering into a league with\r\nour enemies. Therefore, let us at once declare war on Turkey. Any such\r\nleague is of value only if all its members are willing to make war\r\non the same offenders, and the culpable failure of our Government to\r\nmake war on Turkey and Bulgaria makes it absurd and hypocritical for\r\nus to promise to enter such a league in the future until this failure\r\nis confessed and atoned for. And let us at once send Major-General\r\nWood and fifty thousand men to aid the Czecho-Slovaks in Siberia and\r\nestablish our front well to the west of the Ural Mountains.\r\n\r\nAgain, the talk of merely giving autonomy to the subject races of\r\nAustria amounts to betrayal of the Czecho-Slovaks, the Jugo-Slavs,\r\nthe Italians, and the Rumanians. The first should be given their\r\nindependence and the other three united to the nations with which they\r\nreally belong. Moreover, it is a betrayal of civilization to leave the\r\nTurk in Europe and fail to free the Armenians and the other subject\r\nraces of Turkey.\r\n\r\nAgain, let us define what is meant by abolishing secret diplomacy. If\r\nit means that the Administration is to renounce the system of secret\r\nand furtive diplomacy which it now perseveres in concerning what has\r\nhappened in Mexico, Haiti, and San Domingo, I heartily agree; but I\r\ndo not see why it needs an international mandate before it tells our\r\npeople the truth in these matters. Moreover, before it undertakes a\r\nfresh agreement, let it explain why for two years it kept secret from\r\nour people the full knowledge it had of Germany’s conduct and attitude\r\ntoward us, including all the matters set forth in Ambassador Gerard’s\r\nbooks. The American Nation has never seen such secret diplomacy\r\npracticed by its Government as it has seen during the last five years.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, before these fourteen points are accepted as the basis\r\nfor peace discussion, they should be stated in such straightforward\r\nlanguage that we may understand what they mean. The prime necessities\r\nat present are simplicity of language and the squaring of deeds with\r\nwords. The thing we do not need is adroit and supple rhetoric which can\r\nbe interpreted to mean anything or nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERMANENT PREPAREDNESS AND THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 15, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vital military need of this country as regards its future\r\ninternational relations is the immediate adoption of the policy of\r\npermanent preparedness based on universal training. This is its prime\r\nduty from the standpoint of American nationalism and patriotism. Then,\r\nas an addition or supplement to, but under no conditions as substitute\r\nfor, the policy of permanent preparedness, we can afford cautiously to\r\nenter into and try out the policy of a league of nations. There is no\r\ndifficulty whatever in prattling cheerfully about such a league or in\r\nwinning applause by rhetoric concerning it prior to the effort to make\r\nit work in practice; but there will be much difficulty in making it\r\nwork at all when any serious strain comes, and it will prove entirely\r\nunworkable if the effort is made to unload upon it, in the name of\r\ninternationalism, duties which in the present state of the world will\r\nbe efficiently performed by the free nations only if they perform them\r\nas national duties.\r\n\r\nIn a recent adverse, but courteous and friendly article on my attitude\r\nin this matter which appeared in a great daily paper, the following\r\nlanguage was used: “The colonel is letting himself be bothered,\r\nirritated, and sidetracked by fools. There is no way of preventing\r\na fool from saying that he is in favor of the league of nations.\r\nThe American people will be making up their minds about the league\r\nof nations and about permanent preparedness. They will be told by\r\ncertain sorts of pacifists that if they accept the league they can\r\nsafely reject preparedness. They will be told that the two ideas are\r\nopposites.”\r\n\r\nThe “certain sort of pacifist” who has made this statement to the\r\npeople of the United States is the President of the United States in\r\nthe now famous “fourteen points” which he enunciated last January. He\r\nadvocated as one part of his plan the league or association of nations,\r\nas he has elsewhere advocated it, and he advocated as another part of\r\nhis plan “the guarantees that national armaments will be reduced to the\r\nlowest point consistent with domestic safety.” Unless this language was\r\nused with intent to deceive, domestic safety must mean merely freedom\r\nfrom riot, and the President’s proposal is that America’s national\r\npreparedness be limited to a police force to prevent domestic disorder.\r\nTherefore, the President has told the American people that if they\r\naccept the league they can safely reject preparedness.\r\n\r\nThe President may change his mind, and I sincerely hope he will do so.\r\nUntil he does so it is the duty of every sincere American patriot to\r\nlay far more emphasis on the onerous and indispensable duty of national\r\npreparedness than on the wholly untested scheme of a league of nations,\r\nwhich the President has presented as an alternative. I heartily favor\r\ntrue internationalism as an addition to, but never as substitute for, a\r\nfervid and intensely patriotic nationalism. I will gladly back any wise\r\nand honest effort to create a league of nations, but only on condition\r\nthat it is treated as an addition to, and not as a substitute for, the\r\nfull preparedness of our own strength for our own defense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIGH-SOUNDING PHRASES OF MUDDY MEANING\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 17, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nA keen observer of what is now happening in the world writes me that\r\nthere is very grave danger that this country will be cheated out of the\r\nright kind of peace if our people remain fatuously content to accept\r\nhigh-sounding phrases of muddy meaning, instead of clear-cut and\r\ntruthful statements of just what we demand and just what we intend to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nThe recent action of President Wilson in connection with Germany\r\nhas shown the imperative need of our people informing themselves of\r\nhis announced purpose and keeping track of what he does toward the\r\nachievement of this purpose. Therefore, we should insist upon the\r\npurpose being stated in understandable fashion and being adhered to\r\nafter it has been stated. This isn’t the President’s war. It is the\r\npeople’s war. The peace will not be a satisfactory peace unless it\r\nis the people’s peace. As a people we have no right to permit the\r\nPresident to commit us to that of which we do not approve or to that\r\nwhich, after honest effort, we are unable to understand.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson’s first communication to the German Government, if\r\nwords mean anything, meant an effort to treat on the basis of his\r\nso-called “fourteen points.” The German Government answered that it\r\naccepted these fourteen points and approved of them. This made them\r\npublic property, and it behooves the Americans to examine them. I\r\nbelieve that such an examination will show the American people that\r\ntheir meaning is so muddy that we should insist upon their being\r\nclearly defined before we in any way accept them as ours. When the\r\npeace terms come to be reduced to action, we cannot afford to accept\r\nempty competitive rhetoric for straightforward plain dealing.\r\n\r\nAs regards some of the points, either the meaning is so muddy as to\r\nbe wholly incomprehensible or else the proposals are very treacherous.\r\nThe fourth article, for example, proposes guarantees for the reduction\r\nof national armaments to the lowest point consistent with domestic\r\nsafety. If this article means anything, it means that this Nation, for\r\ninstance, is only to keep whatever armed forces are necessary to police\r\nthe country in the event of domestic disturbance. Now, let our people\r\nface what this really implies. It is a proposal that we give up our\r\nnavy, which, of course, cannot be used for such police purposes, and\r\nthat we give up all of our army that could be used against a foreign\r\nfoe. And according to point fourteen of his address to Congress of\r\nJanuary 8 last, and according to point three in his speech of September\r\n27 last, this lack of armament on our part is to be supplied by mutual\r\nguarantees of political independence and territorial integrity within\r\nthe league of nations covering the world.\r\n\r\nNow, such guarantees are precisely and exactly the scraps of paper to\r\nwhich the German Chancellor likened them when his Government tore up\r\nthose affecting Belgium. The proposal of President Wilson is that this\r\ncountry shall put itself in the position of Belgium; shall trust to\r\nguarantees precisely such as those to which Belgium trusted four and\r\none quarter years ago, and he also proposes, as far as his meaning can\r\nbe made out at all, that the very powers that treated these guarantees\r\nas scraps of paper in the case of Belgium shall be among the powers to\r\nwhose guarantee we are to trust to the exclusion of all preparation\r\nfor our own self-defense. All nations are to be asked to render\r\nthemselves helpless with fatuous indifference to the obvious fact that\r\nevery weak-minded nation which accepted and acted in the proposal would\r\nbe at the mercy of every ruthless and efficient nation that chose to\r\ntreat the proposal as a scrap of paper.\r\n\r\nI gravely doubt whether a more silly or more mischievous plan was ever\r\nseriously proposed by the ruler of a great nation. Yet, this is exactly\r\nthe plan to which President Wilson, by his correspondence with Germany,\r\nhas sought definitely to commit the United States. If his words do not\r\nmean exactly what is above set forth, then their meaning is so muddy\r\nthat no two disinterested outsiders would be warranted in interpreting\r\nthem the same way.\r\n\r\nThere is small cause for wonder that Germany eagerly accepted and\r\nmade her own President Wilson’s fourteen points to which he, without\r\nany warrant whatever, seemed to commit this Nation. Incidentally I\r\nmay add that Mr. Wilson has at different times enunciated at least as\r\nmany other points, some of them contradictory to the fourteen which he\r\nenumerated in January last. The outburst of popular indignation led by\r\nsuch men as Senators Lodge, Poindexter, and Thomas, which forced him\r\nto repudiate the negotiations which he had begun with Germany, should\r\nbe supplemented by a resolute insistence upon the duty of the American\r\npublic to inform itself as to what it wishes in the peace before the\r\nPresident, without authority, commits it to any peace proposal, and\r\nabove all to peace proposals which may mean anything or nothing.\r\n\r\nSecretary McAdoo, with fine family loyalty, announced that the\r\nacceptance by Germany of the fourteen points would have meant Germany’s\r\nunconditional surrender. He might as well have said that the acceptance\r\nof disunion and the perpetuation of slavery in 1864 would have meant\r\na surrender by the Confederate states. Not only Germany, but every\r\npacifist and pro-German here at home, hailed the fourteen points as\r\nrepresenting what they desired. I recently spoke to a body of loyal\r\nAmericans of German descent on behalf of the Liberty Loan. A member of\r\ntheir organization who was not a straight American, but a hyphenated\r\nAmerican, and who did not venture to do more than sign himself\r\nas “German-American,” wrote me that in view of my repudiation of\r\nPresident Wilson’s so-called fourteen points he could not, as a loyal\r\nGerman-American, do otherwise than condemn me. The individual himself\r\nis doubtless as unimportant as the anonymous letter writer usually\r\nis, but there is a real significance in his endorsement of President\r\nWilson’s fourteen points in view of his calling himself so emphatically\r\nnot a straight-out American, but a German-American. Evidently his\r\nloyalty is to Germanism and not to Americanism, and this German loyalty\r\nof his made him back the President’s fourteen points, which Germany had\r\nso gladly accepted.\r\n\r\nThe American people should insist that these fourteen points and any\r\nother points are stated in clear-cut language, and that there be a full\r\nunderstanding of just what is meant by them and a full knowledge of how\r\nfar the American people approve of them before any foreign power is\r\npermitted to think that they represent America’s position at the peace\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN AMERICAN PEACE _VERSUS_ A RUBBER-STAMP PEACE\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 22, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Wallace’s Farmer, a journal devoted to the interests of the farmer,\r\nand also to the interests of every good American citizen, but which has\r\nno concern with partisan politics, there is a strong editorial against\r\nour acceptance of a peace on the terms of the famous fourteen points\r\nlaid down by President Wilson in his message of January last. It reads\r\nin part as follows:\r\n\r\n Of course, Germany would like to make peace on the terms laid down\r\n by President Wilson in his speech of January 8, for it would allow\r\n Germany to escape the just penalty of her crimes and restore her to\r\n her condition before the war.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the leading Socialist paper of New York\r\nenthusiastically champions the fourteen points, especially those\r\ndemanding a league of nations, freedom of the seas according to\r\nthe German party, and the removal of all economic barriers. This\r\nchampionship is natural, for the Socialists, like the I.W.W. of this\r\ncountry, who have been bitterly pro-German and anti-American, and\r\nlike the worst Russian Bolsheviks, have steadily worked in Germany’s\r\ninterests; and like all its professional internationalists they hate\r\nthe liberty-loving nations so bitterly that they are eagerly working\r\nfor peace satisfactory to the German autocracy. All such persons,\r\nso far as they are not merely silly, seek their own profit in the\r\ndestruction of civilization, and they would hail an inconclusive peace,\r\nwhich would mean the triumph of militarism, rather than see the free\r\nnations triumphant over both militarism and anarchy.\r\n\r\nBut in his last note to Austria, President Wilson himself flatly\r\nrepudiates one of his fourteen points--that relating to autonomy for\r\nthe Czecho-Slovaks and Jugo-Slavs under the Austro-Hungarian yoke. He\r\nannounces that he has changed his position because facts have changed,\r\nbut in reality the facts have not changed in even the smallest degree\r\nbetween January and October so far as these two nationalities are\r\nconcerned. Many persons, including myself, had then been demanding for\r\nover a year this complete independence. Nothing whatever has changed in\r\nthe situation except Mr. Wilson’s mind, and obviously this has changed\r\nmerely because the American people have gradually waked up and have\r\nforced him in this matter to take a course diametrically opposed to\r\nthe one he had been advocating, precisely as a week ago an aroused and\r\nindignant public opinion forced him to absolutely reverse the course\r\nof negotiation on which he entered with Germany. The popular feeling\r\nwould have been inarticulate and helpless if it had not received\r\nexpression from various patriotic public servants and private citizens\r\nand from those fearless newspapers, which, at the risk of grave\r\nfinancial disaster, have ventured when the crisis was serious to defy\r\nthe sinister efforts of the Administration to do away with the freedom\r\nof the press. Senators Lodge, Poindexter, and Thomas and Congressman\r\nFess are examples of the public servants, and Professor Hobbs, of the\r\nUniversity of Michigan, and Professor Thayer, of Harvard, are examples\r\nof private citizens who have well served the people of the United\r\nStates in this crisis.\r\n\r\nOf course, the entire cuckoo or rubber-stamp tribe of politicians\r\ntumbled over themselves in the effort to assure the President that no\r\nmatter what somersault he turned they would flop with equal quickness,\r\nand that their responsibility was solely to him and not to the people\r\nof the United States or to the cause of right and of fearlessness\r\nand of honorable dealing. Senator Lewis, of Illinois, introduced a\r\nresolution stating that “the United States Senate approves whatever\r\ncourse may be taken by the President in dealing with the German\r\nImperial Government and the Austrian Imperial Government and endorses\r\nand approves whatever methods he may employ.” Senator Lewis is, in\r\nprivate life, an amiable and kindly gentleman, but the above resolution\r\nis a somewhat abject announcement that in public life he aspires only\r\nto be a rubber stamp. If such position is proper, then there is no\r\nneed of Senators or Congressmen, and our people should merely send\r\nwritten proxies to Washington and should otherwise copy the example\r\nof those big private corporations which are controlled by one man\r\naccording to his own will and for his own benefit.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that the American people will accept a view which\r\nis both so abject and so profoundly unpatriotic. This is the war of\r\nthe American people and the peace which concludes it should be the\r\npeace imposed by the American people. Therefore, they should send to\r\nWashington public servants who will be self-respecting Americans and\r\nnot rubber stamps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 26, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the American people speak for unconditional surrender, it means\r\nthat Germany must accept whatever terms the United States and its\r\nallies think necessary in order to right the dreadful wrongs that have\r\nbeen committed and to safeguard the world for at least a generation\r\nto come from another attempt by Germany to secure world dominion.\r\nUnconditional surrender is the reverse of a negotiated peace. The\r\ninterchange of notes, which has been going on between our Government\r\nand the Governments of Germany and Austria during the last three weeks,\r\nmeans, of course, if persisted in, a negotiated peace. It is the\r\nabandonment of force and the substitution of negotiation. This fact\r\nshould be clearly and truthfully stated by our leaders, so that the\r\nAmerican people may decide with their eyes open which course they will\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nThose of us who believe in unconditional surrender regard Germany’s\r\nbehavior during the last five years as having made her the outlaw among\r\nnations. In private life sensible men and women do not negotiate with\r\nan outlaw or grow sentimental about him, or ask for a peace with him\r\non terms of equality if he will give up his booty. Still less do they\r\npropose to make a league with him for the future, and on the strength\r\nof this league to abolish the sheriff and take the constable. On the\r\ncontrary, they expect the law officers to take him by force and to\r\nhave him tried and punished. They do not punish him out of revenge,\r\nbut because all intelligent persons know punishment to be necessary in\r\norder to stop certain kinds of criminals from wrongdoing and to save\r\nthe community from such wrongdoing.\r\n\r\nWe ought to treat Germany in precisely this manner. It is a sad\r\nand dreadful thing to have to face some months or a year or so of\r\nadditional bloodshed, but it is a much worse thing to quit now and\r\nhave the children now growing up obliged to do the job all over again,\r\nwith ten times as much bloodshed and suffering, when their turn comes.\r\nThe surest way to secure a peace as lasting as that which followed the\r\ndownfall of Napoleon is to overthrow the Prussianized Germany of the\r\nHohenzollerns as Napoleon was overthrown. If we enter into a league\r\nof peace with Germany and her vassal allies, we must expect them to\r\ntreat the arrangement as a scrap of paper whenever it becomes to their\r\ninterest to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT ARE THE FOURTEEN POINTS?\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 30, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThe European nations have been told that the fourteen points enumerated\r\nin President Wilson’s message of January last are to be the basis of\r\npeace. It is, therefore, possible that Americans may like to know what\r\nthey are. It is even possible that they may like to guess what they\r\nmean, although I am not certain that such guessing is permitted by the\r\nPostmaster-General and the Attorney-General under the new theory of\r\nmaking democracy safe for all kinds of peoples abroad who have never\r\nheard of it by interpreting democracy at home as meaning that it is\r\nunlawful for the people to express any except favorable opinions of\r\nthe way in which the public servants of the people transact the public\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThe first point forbids “all private international understandings of\r\nany kind,” and says there must be “open covenants of peace, openly\r\narrived at,” and announces that “diplomacy shall always proceed\r\nfrankly in the public view.” The President has recently waged war on\r\nHaiti and San Domingo and rendered democracy within these two small\r\nformer republics not merely unsafe, but non-existent. He has kept\r\nall that he has done in the matter absolutely secret. If he means\r\nwhat he says, he will at once announce what open covenant of peace he\r\nhas openly arrived at with these two little republics, which he has\r\ndeprived of their right of self-determination. He will also announce\r\nwhat public international understanding, if any, he now has with these\r\ntwo republics, whose soil he is at present occupying with the armed\r\nforces of the United States and hundreds of whose citizens have been\r\nkilled by these armed forces. If he has no such public understanding,\r\nhe will tell us why, and whether he has any private international\r\nunderstanding, or whether he invaded and conquered them and deprived\r\nthem of the right of self-determination without any attempt to reach\r\nany understanding, either private or public.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he has just sent abroad on a diplomatic mission Mr. House,\r\nof Texas. Mr. House is not in the public service of the Nation, but he\r\nis in the private service of Mr. Wilson. He is usually called Colonel\r\nHouse. In his official or semi-official biography, published in an\r\nardently admiring New York paper, it is explained that he was once\r\nappointed colonel on a governor’s staff, but carried his dislike of\r\nmilitary ostentation to the point of giving his uniform to a negro\r\nservant to wear on social occasions. This attitude of respect for the\r\nuniform makes the President feel that he is peculiarly fit to negotiate\r\non behalf of our fighting men abroad for whom the uniform is sacred.\r\nAssociated with him is an editor of the New York World, which paper\r\nhas recently been busy in denouncing as foolish the demand made by so\r\nmany Americans for unconditional surrender by Germany.\r\n\r\nI do not doubt that these two gentlemen possess charming social\r\nattributes and much private worth, but as they are sent over on a\r\ndiplomatic mission, presumably vitally affecting the whole country, and\r\nas their instructions and purposes are shrouded in profound mystery,\r\nit seems permissible to ask President Wilson why in this particular\r\ninstance diplomacy does not “proceed frankly in the public view”?\r\n\r\nThis first one of the fourteen points offers such an illuminating\r\nopportunity to test promise as to the future by performance in the\r\npresent that I have considered it at some length. The other thirteen\r\npoints and the subsequent points laid down as further requirements for\r\npeace I shall briefly take up in another article.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER CONSIDERATION OF THE FOURTEEN POINTS\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 30, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second in the fourteen points deals with freedom of the seas. It\r\nmakes no distinction between freeing the seas from murder like that\r\ncontinually practiced by Germany and freeing them from blockade of\r\ncontraband merchandise, which is the practice of a right universally\r\nenjoyed by belligerents, and at this moment practiced by the United\r\nStates. Either this proposal is meaningless or it is a mischievous\r\nconcession to Germany.\r\n\r\nThe third point promises free trade among all the nations, unless\r\nthe words are designedly used to conceal President Wilson’s true\r\nmeaning. This would deny to our country the right to make a tariff\r\nto protect its citizens, and especially its working-men, against\r\nGermany or China or any other country. Apparently this is desired on\r\nthe ground that the incidental domestic disaster to this country will\r\nprevent other countries from feeling hostile to us. The supposition is\r\nfoolish. England practiced free trade and yet Germany hated England\r\nparticularly, and Turkey practiced free trade without deserving or\r\nobtaining friendship from any one except those who desired to exploit\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe fourth point provides that this Nation, like every other, is to\r\nreduce its armaments to the lowest limit consistent with domestic\r\nsafety. Either this is language deliberately used to deceive or else it\r\nmeans that we are to scrap our army and navy and prevent riot by means\r\nof a national constabulary, like the state constabulary of New York or\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nPoint five proposes that colonial claims shall all be treated on the\r\nsame basis. Unless the language is deliberately used to deceive,\r\nthis means that we are to restore to our brutal enemy the colonies\r\ntaken by our allies while they were defending us from this enemy. The\r\nproposition is probably meaningless. If it is not, it is monstrous.\r\n\r\nPoint six deals with Russia. It probably means nothing, but if it means\r\nanything, it provides that America shall share on equal terms with\r\nother nations, including Germany, Austria, and Turkey, in giving Russia\r\nassistance. The whole proposition would not be particularly out of\r\nplace in a college sophomore’s exercise in rhetoric.\r\n\r\nPoint seven deals with Belgium and is entirely proper and commonplace.\r\n\r\nPoint eight deals with Alsace-Lorraine and is couched in language\r\nwhich betrays Mr. Wilson’s besetting sin--his inability to speak in\r\na straightforward manner. He may mean that Alsace and Lorraine must\r\nbe restored to France, in which case he is right. He may mean that a\r\nplebiscite must be held, in which case he is playing Germany’s evil\r\ngame.\r\n\r\nPoint nine deals with Italy, and is right.\r\n\r\nPoint ten deals with the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and is so foolish\r\nthat even President Wilson has since abandoned it.\r\n\r\nPoint eleven proposes that we, together with other nations, including\r\napparently Germany, Austria, and Hungary, shall guarantee justice in\r\nthe Balkan Peninsula. As this would also guarantee our being from\r\ntime to time engaged in war over matters in which we had no interest\r\nwhatever, it is worth while inquiring whether President Wilson proposes\r\nthat we wage these wars with the national constabulary to which he\r\ndesired to reduce our armed forces.\r\n\r\nPoint twelve proposes to perpetuate the infamy of Turkish rule in\r\nEurope, and as a sop to the conscience of humanity proposes to give the\r\nsubject races autonomy, a slippery word which in a case like this is\r\nuseful only for rhetorical purposes.\r\n\r\nPoint thirteen proposes an independent Poland, which is right; and then\r\nproposes that we guarantee its integrity in the event of future war,\r\nwhich is preposterous unless we intend to become a military nation more\r\nfit for overseas warfare than Germany is at present.\r\n\r\nPoint fourteen proposes a general association of nations to guarantee\r\nto great and small states alike political independence and territorial\r\nintegrity. It is dishonorable to make this proposition so long as\r\nPresident Wilson continues to act as he is now acting in Haiti and\r\nSan Domingo. In its essence Mr. Wilson’s proposition for a league of\r\nnations seems to be akin to the holy alliance of the nations of Europe\r\na century ago, which worked such mischief that the Monroe Doctrine was\r\ncalled into being especially to combat it. If it is designed to do away\r\nwith nationalism, it will work nothing but mischief. If it is devised\r\nin sane fashion as an addition to nationalism and as an addition to\r\npreparing our own strength for our own defense, it may do a small\r\namount of good; but it will certainly accomplish nothing if more than a\r\nmoderate amount is attempted and probably the best first step would be\r\nto make the existing league of the Allies a going concern.\r\n\r\nAs to the supplementary points or proposals, the four advanced or laid\r\ndown in February were sound moral aphorisms of no value save as they\r\nmay be defined in each particular case.\r\n\r\nBut the supplementary five proposals set forth by President Wilson\r\nlast September were, on the whole, mischievous and were capable of a\r\nconstruction that would make them ruinous in their essence. They set\r\nforth the doctrine that there must be no discrimination between our\r\nfriends and our enemies and no special economic or political alliances\r\namong friendly nations, but uniform treatment of all the league of\r\nnations; the said league, therefore, to include Germany, Austria,\r\nTurkey, and Russia upon a footing of equality of our allies. Either\r\nthe words used mean nothing or they mean that we are to enter a league\r\nin which we make-believe that our deadly enemies, stained with every\r\nkind of brutality and treachery, are as worthy of friendship as the\r\nAllies who have fought our battles for four years. No wonder that the\r\nproposal is enthusiastically applauded by Germany, Austria, and Turkey\r\nand by all our own pro-Germans and pacifists and Germanized Socialists\r\nand anti-American internationalists. It is the kind of proposition\r\nmade by cold-blooded men who at least care nothing for the sufferings\r\nof others. It is eagerly championed by foolish and hysterical\r\nsentimentalists. It is accepted and used for sinister purposes by\r\npowerful and cynical wrongdoers. When the President was making this\r\nproposition and during the subsequent month Germany was committing\r\ninhuman murders of the people on the Ticonderoga and Leinster at\r\nsea, and on shore was committing every species of murder, rape,\r\nenslavement, plunder, and outrage as her armies withdrew from France\r\nand Belgium.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson’s announcement was a notice to the malefactors that\r\nthey would not be punished for the murders. Let us treat the league of\r\nnations only as an addition to, and not as a substitute for, thorough\r\npreparedness and intense nationalism on our part. Let none of the\r\npresent international criminals be admitted until a sufficient number\r\nof years has passed to make us sure it has repented. Make conduct the\r\ntest of admission to the league. In every crisis judge each nation by\r\nits conduct. Therefore, at the present time let us stand by our friends\r\nand against our enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTEEN SCRAPS OF PAPER\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 31, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my article yesterday I discussed Mr. Wilson’s fourteen peace points\r\nwhich had been accepted by Germany. After the article was sent in, Mr.\r\nWilson explained one of the points by stating that it meant exactly the\r\nopposite of what it said. A New York paper has asked for the election\r\nof a Congress that shall see eye to eye with Mr. Wilson. But only a\r\nCongress of whirling dervishes could see eye to eye with Mr. Wilson for\r\nmore than twenty-four hours at a time.\r\n\r\nWhen Germany broke her treaty with Belgium, the German Chancellor\r\ncalled it a scrap of paper. Any individual who proposes a treaty which\r\nplainly means one thing, and then, as soon as he finds it disagreeable\r\nto adhere to that obvious meaning, instantly interprets it as meaning\r\nexactly the opposite, is treating it as a scrap of paper. Mr. Wilson’s\r\nrecent interpretation of what he meant in the point about economic\r\nbarriers makes all the fourteen points scraps of paper unworthy of\r\nserious discussion by anybody, because no human being is supposed\r\nto say what any one of them means or to do more than guess whether\r\nto-morrow Mr. Wilson will not interpret each and all of them in a sense\r\nexactly the opposite to their meaning.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson’s language in the point in question was that he intended\r\nthe removal “of all economic barriers and the establishment of an\r\nequality of trade conditions among all the nations.” By no honest\r\nconstruction of language can this be held to mean anything except that\r\nthis Nation, for example, could have no tariff of its own, but must\r\nlive under exactly the same tariff, or no tariff, conditions with all\r\nother nations. But Mr. Wilson now notifies a Democratic Senator that he\r\ndid not mean any “restriction upon the free determination by any nation\r\nof its own economic policy.” If he meant this, why did he not say\r\nit? Why did he say the exact opposite? His first statement is wholly\r\nincompatible with the interpretation he now puts on it. If anybody in\r\nprivate life entered into a contract in such manner and then sought\r\nto repudiate it by interpreting it in such manner, there is not a\r\ncourt in Christendom that would not adjudge him guilty of having used\r\nlanguage with deliberate intent to deceive.\r\n\r\nNor is this all. In his new interpretation of what he did not\r\noriginally mean, the President now says that he proposes to prevent\r\nany nation, including the United States, from using its tariff to\r\ndiscriminate in favor of friendly nations and against hostile nations.\r\nThis is what he now says and what he now means, but, of course,\r\nto-morrow he may say that in this new interpretation he again meant\r\nexactly the opposite of what he says. However this may be for the\r\nfuture, President Wilson at this moment says, for instance, we ought\r\nto abandon reciprocity treaties; that we ought to refuse to make such\r\ntreaties with our friends, such as Cuba and Brazil, and ought to punish\r\nthese friends by treating them on an exact equality with our embittered\r\nand malevolent enemy, Germany. I hold this to be thoroughly mischievous\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\nThe great scientist, Huxley, who loved truth and abhorred falsehood,\r\nsaid that “the primary condition of honest literature is to leave the\r\nreader in no doubt as to the author’s meaning.” Evidently this primary\r\ncondition is not fulfilled by Mr. Wilson’s fourteen points. They should\r\nnow be treated as scraps of paper and put where they belong, in the\r\nscrap-basket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TURKS SURRENDER UNCONDITIONALLY\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 3, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThe British have beaten Turkey to her knees and she has surrendered\r\nunconditionally. America has no share in the honor of what has been\r\ndone. President Wilson, although we were at war with Germany, has\r\nrefused to aid our allies against Turkey and has preserved the same\r\ncold neutrality between the Armenians and their Turkish butchers that\r\nhe formerly did between the Belgians and their German oppressors.\r\n\r\nTurkey had inflicted inhuman wrongs on the subject peoples and had\r\ninfringed our own treaty rights, but President Wilson refused to go to\r\nwar with her. Yet with our navy at the very outbreak of hostilities\r\nand then with a considerable and constantly growing army, if we had\r\nbeen willing we could have materially aided the British and French. In\r\nsuch event Constantinople would doubtless have been taken long ago.\r\nAs it is, thanks to President Wilson, we Americans can only look on\r\nand rejoice that others did better than our rulers let us do. We have\r\nhad no hand in the freeing of Palestine, Syria, and Armenia. Under the\r\ngreat law of service and sacrifice it is the British and French alone\r\nwho have the moral right to determine the fate of Turkey. They, and\r\nespecially the British, have poured out their blood freely, and now,\r\nafter the victory has been gained, expenditure of ink on our part\r\nis of mighty small consequence in comparison. I earnestly hope that\r\npermanent justice will be done by expelling the Turk from Europe and\r\nmaking all Armenia independent. But we have lost the right to insist on\r\nthese points.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the end came when, two or three weeks ago, Bulgaria\r\nwas forced to surrender unconditionally. Here again, thanks to\r\nPresident Wilson, America had no part in the honor and credit of the\r\nvital triumph. Our Government was still neutral about Bulgaria, still\r\ntoo proud to fight either Turkey or Bulgaria, still hoping for peace\r\nwithout victory over them.\r\n\r\nNow Turkey has surrendered and Austria has broken up. In the case of\r\nAustria, after ten months’ unpardonable delay, we did finally go to\r\nwar, and we have a very small share in the great glory won by Italy and\r\nthe other Allies.\r\n\r\nThe greatest contest was on the western front, and here the hundreds\r\nof thousands of American troops engaged under Foch and Pershing have\r\nshown such extraordinary gallantry and efficiency that we are all\r\nforever their debtors. Nearly a month ago President Wilson entered\r\ninto negotiations with Germany which, if continued along the line\r\nhe started, might have caused disaster. Fortunately there was such\r\nan outburst of protest in the country that our allies took part and\r\nPresident Wilson himself took warning. President Wilson may still\r\nserve as a channel of communication. But General Foch will be the\r\nreal master of the situation. The men with guns and not the men with\r\nfountain pens will dictate the terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEACE\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 12, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nFour years and a quarter have passed since Germany, by the invasion\r\nof Belgium, began the World War and made it at the same time a war of\r\ncynical treachery and of bestiality and of inhuman wrongdoing. Almost\r\nfrom the beginning our governmental authorities were well informed\r\nof the organized brutality with which it was waged and of the fact\r\nthat the Kaiser and the leading soldiers, politicians, and commercial\r\nmagnates of Germany had deliberately plunged the world into war because\r\nthey expected to profit by conquest, while the Socialist Party aided\r\nand abetted them in the hope of sharing some of the profit.\r\n\r\nThe rest of us ordinary Americans were successfully hoodwinked because\r\nthe facts were concealed from us. But gradually the truth leaked\r\nthrough to us. First we learned that the stories of the atrocities were\r\ntrue. Then, although not until much later, we found out that there was\r\nample proof that Germany had brought on the war to gratify her greed\r\nfor gold and her arrogant and conscienceless lust for world domination.\r\nFinally we were permitted to learn that Germany intended to strike us\r\ndown as soon as she had made the free nations her victims. Now our\r\ntroops have played a manful part, a part not only heroic and efficient,\r\nbut also of decisive consequence in the final terrible struggle.\r\n\r\nIt is not pleasant to think that the two first crushing blows in\r\nbringing about the end, the overthrow of Bulgaria and the overthrow of\r\nTurkey, were due in no way to us, but solely to our allies, England\r\nand France. We never made war on either offending nation; we remained\r\nneutral, and this exhibition of feeble diplomacy on our part made us\r\nonlookers instead of partakers of the triumph. But with Austria, after\r\nmuch hesitation and wabbling, we did finally go to war, and, although\r\nour part was very small, we have a modest right to share the general\r\nsatisfaction over the victory. In the case of Germany, however, we\r\nplayed a really great part, and although until the very end we were\r\nunable to put on the fighting line any tanks or field guns or battle\r\nplanes, and relatively only a small number of machine guns and bombing\r\nand observation planes, our soldiers themselves were probably on the\r\naverage the finest troops who fought in Europe.\r\n\r\nAnd now the German imperial military and capitalistic authority has\r\nbeen beaten to its knees and forced to accept all the terms the Allies\r\nhave imposed upon it. The able and wicked men who thought to wade\r\nthrough a sea of blood to world domination must now bow their heads\r\nbefore the outside peoples whom they have so cruelly wronged and face\r\nthe sullen distrust and hostility of their own people, whom they misled\r\nby promising them a share in the profits of successful guilt. Their\r\ndoom has come upon them.\r\n\r\nA little over a month ago the Administration embarked upon a career\r\nof note-writing with Germany, which, if unchecked, might have meant a\r\npeace of practical profit to Germany. But the feeling of the American\r\npeople, especially in the West, showed itself in such direct and\r\nstraightforward fashion that this effort was soon abandoned. Moreover,\r\nat the recent election, the American people, with the issue squarely\r\nbefore them, declared that they were the masters of their public\r\nservants and not rubber stamps, and that this was the people’s war\r\nand not the war of any one man or any one party, and that loyalty to\r\nourselves and our allies stood ahead of adherence to any man. Germany\r\nhas been beaten down abroad and at home. The pro-Germans and the\r\npacifists and the defeatists and the Germanized Socialists, and all the\r\ncrew who stand for any form of either Bolshevism or Kaiserism, have\r\nbeen warned that they shall not betray this Nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSACRIFICE ON COLD ALTARS\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 13, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nA friend, a California woman, writes me that there is staying with\r\nher a widow whose only son has been in the navy and has just died of\r\ninfluenza, and that the mother said:\r\n\r\n I gave my boy proudly to my country. I never held him back, even in my\r\n heart. But if only he had died with a gun in his hand--a little glory\r\n for him and a thought for me that my sacrifice had not been useless.\r\n\r\nMy correspondent continues:\r\n\r\n There must be so many mothers who feel that they have laid their\r\n sacrifice on cold altars. You have written much that will comfort the\r\n mothers whose sons have paid with their bodies in battle. Isn’t there\r\n something you can say to help these other mothers?\r\n\r\nI felt a real pang when I received this letter, because the thought\r\nsuggested had been in my mind, and yet I had failed to express it. It\r\nhad happened that my own sons and nephews and young cousins and their\r\nclose friends were where death or wounds came to them on the field of\r\naction. For example, on the day I received this letter we also got news\r\nthat the closest school and college and army friend of my son, Quentin,\r\nwho was killed, had himself just been killed. He was a man who had been\r\npromoted for a series of hazardous and successful battles with German\r\nairmen. He was as gentle and clean and lovable as a girl, yet terrible\r\nin his battle, and no more high and fearless soul ever fronted death\r\njoyously in the high heavens. My mind had, because of facts like this,\r\nturned toward the deaths of the men on the firing line; and I regret\r\nthat I did not make it evident as I meant to make it, and but for this\r\noversight would have made it, that all who have given their lives\r\nor the lives dearest to them in this war stand on an exact level of\r\nservice and sacrifice and honor and glory.\r\n\r\nThe men who have died of pneumonia or fever in the hospitals, the men\r\nwho have been killed in accidents on the airplane training fields are\r\nas much heroes as those who were killed at the front, and their shining\r\nsouls shall hereafter light up all to a clearer and greater view of the\r\nduties of life. The war is over now. The time of frightful losses among\r\nthe men at the front and of heartbreaking anxiety for their mothers\r\nand wives, their sisters and sweethearts at home has passed. No great\r\ntriumph is ever won save by the payment of the necessary cost. All of\r\nus who have stayed at home and all the others who have returned safe\r\nwill, as long as life shall last, think of the men who died as having\r\npurchased for us and for our children’s children, as long as this\r\ncountry shall last, a heritage so precious that even their precious\r\nblood was not too great a price to pay. Whether they fell in battle or\r\nhow they died matters not at all, and it matters not what they were\r\ndoing as long as, high of soul, they were doing their duty with all the\r\nstrength and fervor of their natures.\r\n\r\nThe mother or the wife whose son or husband has died, whether in battle\r\nor by fever or in the accident inevitable in hurriedly preparing a\r\nmodern army for war, must never feel that the sacrifice has been laid\r\n“on a cold altar.” There is no gradation of honor among these gallant\r\nmen and no essential gradation of service. They all died that we might\r\nlive; our debt is to all of them, and we can pay it even personally\r\nonly by striving so to live as to bring a little nearer the day when\r\njustice and mercy shall rule in our own homes and among the nations of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RED FLAG AND THE HUN PEACE DRIVE\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 14, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThe war is won. A twofold duty is now incumbent on us. We must strive\r\nto make the peace one of justice and righteousness and to throw out\r\nsuch safeguards around it as will give us the greatest possible chance\r\nof permanency. Then we must turn to setting aright the affairs of our\r\nown household. But before we set ourselves to the performance of these\r\ntwo tasks we should thoroughly enlighten our enemies at home and abroad\r\non one or two points.\r\n\r\nLet all anti-Americans stand aside. Let them understand that we are not\r\nmerely against some enemies of the country--we are against all enemies\r\nof the country. This week in New York there was a red flag of Anarchy\r\nor Socialistic meeting which was the cause of a riot. It was perfectly\r\nnatural that it should be the cause of a riot. The red flag is as much\r\nan enemy as the flag of the Hohenzollerns. The internationalist of the\r\nred flag or black flag type is an enemy to this Nation just exactly\r\nas much as Hindenburg or Ludendorff was an enemy only a week ago. He\r\nis an even more treacherous enemy and equally brutal. Congress should\r\npass a law without waiting a day prohibiting the use of the red flag\r\nor the black flag or any other flag of the kind here in America. We\r\nhave universal suffrage in America. The majority of our people can\r\nhave what they wish in the way of industrial and political change, if\r\nthey seriously desire it. There isn’t any excuse in this country for\r\nany paltering with revolutionary movements. A riot is riot, without\r\nreference to what the people rioting claim to be for. When a mob gets\r\nstarted, it always acts the same way, no matter what the theoretical\r\ncause of the outbreak may have been. A Bolshevist mob in New York in\r\nall essentials resembles the anti-draft mob of 1863, although the\r\narguments of the parlor Bolsheviki of to-day would be totally different\r\nfrom those of the constitutional copperheads of fifty-five years ago.\r\n\r\nWhen the Romanoffs were overthrown the Russian people lacked\r\nself-control and they permitted the dominion of a Bolshevist gang,\r\nwhich has brought wholesale robbery, murder, and starvation in\r\nits trail. The overthrow of the Hohenzollerns in Germany has been\r\naccompanied by Bolshevist uprising in that country also. There is some\r\nexcuse for excesses in a revolution against a despotism, but in this\r\ncountry there is no more excuse for Bolshevism in any form than there\r\nis for despotism itself. Any foreign-born man who parades with or backs\r\nup a red flag or black flag organization ought to be instantly deported\r\nto the country from which he came. Appropriate punishment should be\r\ndevised for the even more guilty native-born.\r\n\r\nOur National Government should take the most vigorous action and have\r\nit understood that America is a bulwark of order no less than of\r\nliberty. We must make it evident that we will stamp out Bolshevism\r\nwithin our borders just as quickly as Kaiserism.\r\n\r\nMoreover, let us realize the nonsense of the pretense that the German\r\npeople have not been behind the German Government. They were behind\r\ntheir Government with hearty enthusiasm until the Government was\r\nsmashed by the military powers of General Foch. The effort now being\r\nmade by the German Government to bring dissensions between the Allies\r\nby appealing to the United States against the Allies proper should be\r\nspurned by our Government. The French, English, Italians, and Belgians\r\nhave been fighting side by side with our men under Foch. They have\r\nacted as comrades under Foch, and we could not have done anything if we\r\nhad not acted as comrades like the rest. Now let’s play the game when\r\nthe effort is made to divide us by the German peace drive.\r\n\r\nSenator Poindexter was entirely right in his proposed bill. The United\r\nStates must make absolutely common cause with the Allies. We regret\r\nthat the German and Russian people should suffer; the fault lies solely\r\nwith the past or present governments. To the very minute of the closing\r\nof the war the hideous German brutalities continued unabated, and\r\napparently the Turks are still slaughtering Armenians. We will do our\r\nbest to help even our enemies now that they have been stricken down,\r\nbut we will not do so at the cost of doing injustice to our friends.\r\nWe will not permit Hun hypocrisy to succeed where Hun violence has\r\nfailed. And we are equally uncompromising foes of Bolshevism and\r\nKaiserism at home and abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEAGUE OF NATIONS\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 17, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are so many prior things to do and so much uncertainty as to the\r\nform of agreement for permanently increasing the chances of peace that\r\nit is difficult to do more than make a general statement as to what is\r\ndesirable and possibly feasible in the league of nations plan. It would\r\ncertainly be folly to discuss it overmuch until some of the existing\r\nobstacles to peace are overcome. That such discussion may be not\r\nfutile, but mischievous, has been vividly shown in the last six weeks.\r\nDuring the first week of October President Wilson and Germany agreed on\r\nthe famous fourteen points of Mr. Wilson’s as a basis for peace. But\r\nthis agreement amounted to nothing whatever except for a moment it gave\r\nGermany the hope that she could escape disaster by a negotiated peace.\r\nThe emphatic protest of our own people caused this hope to vanish, and\r\njust five weeks later peace came, not on Mr. Wilson’s fourteen points,\r\nbut on General Foch’s twenty-odd points, which had all the directness,\r\nthe straightforwardness, and the unequivocal clearness which the\r\nfourteen points strikingly lacked.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is well to begin considering now the things which\r\nwe think can be done and the things that we think cannot be done in\r\nmaking a league of nations. In the first place, we ought to realize\r\nthat the population of the world clearly understands that in this\r\nwar they have been involved to a degree never hitherto known. In\r\nconsequence the horror of the war is very real, and people are at\r\nleast thinking of the need of coöperation with much greater fixity of\r\npurpose and of understanding than ever before. Of course, fundamentally\r\nwar and peace are matters of the heart rather than of organization,\r\nand any declaration or peace league which represents the high-flown\r\nsentimentality of pacifists and doctrinaires will be worse than\r\nuseless; but if, without in the smallest degree sacrificing our belief\r\nin a sound and intense national aim, we all join with the people of\r\nEngland, France, and Italy and with the people in smaller states who\r\nin practice show themselves able to steer equally clear of Bolshevism\r\nand of Kaiserism, we may be able to make a real and much-needed advance\r\nin the international organization. The United States cannot again\r\ncompletely withdraw into its shell. We need not mix in all European\r\nquarrels nor assume all spheres of interest everywhere to be ours,\r\nbut we ought to join with the other civilized nations of the world in\r\nsome scheme that in a time of great stress would offer a likelihood of\r\nobtaining just settlements that will avert war.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in my judgment, the United States at the peace conference\r\nought to be able to coöperate effectively with the British and French\r\nand Italian Governments to support a practical and effective plan\r\nwhich won’t attempt the impossible, but which will represent a real\r\nstep forward.\r\n\r\nProbably the first essential would be to limit the league at the outset\r\nto the Allies, to the peoples with whom we have been operating and with\r\nwhom we are certain we can coöperate in the future. Neither Turkey nor\r\nAustria need now be considered as regards such a league, and we should\r\nclearly understand that Bolshevist Russia is, and that Bolshevist\r\nGermany would be, as undesirable in such a league as the Germany and\r\nRussia of the Hohenzollerns and Romanoffs. Bolshevism is just as much\r\nan international menace as Kaiserism. Until Germany and Russia have\r\nproved by a course of conduct extending over years that they are\r\ncapable of entering such a league in good faith, so that we can count\r\nupon their fulfilling their duties in it, it would be merely foolish to\r\ntake them in.\r\n\r\nThe league, therefore, would have to be based on the combination\r\namong the Allies of the present war--together with any peoples like\r\nthe Czecho-Slovaks, who have shown that they are fully entitled to\r\nenter into such a league if they desire to do so. Each nation should\r\nabsolutely reserve to itself its right to establish its own tariff and\r\ngeneral economic policy, and absolutely ought to control such vital\r\nquestions as immigration and citizenship and the form of government it\r\nprefers. Then it would probably be best for certain spheres of interest\r\nto be reserved to each nation or a group of nations.\r\n\r\nThe northernmost portion of South America and Mexico and Central\r\nAmerica, all of them fronting on the Panama Canal, have a special\r\ninterest to the United States, more interest than they can have for\r\nany European or Asiatic power. The general conduct of Eastern Asiatic\r\npolicy bears a most close relationship to Japan. The same thing is\r\ntrue as regards other nations and certain of the peculiarly African\r\nand European questions. Everything outside of what is thus reserved,\r\nwhich affects any two members of the league or affects one member of\r\nthe league and outsiders, should be decided by some species of court,\r\nand all the people of the league should guarantee to use their whole\r\nstrength in enforcing the decision.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, means that all the free peoples must keep reasonably\r\nprepared for defense and for helping well-behaved nations against the\r\nnations or hordes which represent despotism, barbarism, and anarchy.\r\nAs far as the United States is concerned, I believe we should keep our\r\nnavy to the highest possible point of efficiency and have it second in\r\nsize to that of Great Britain alone, and we should then have universal\r\nobligatory military training for all our young men for a period of,\r\nsay, nine months during some one year between the ages of nineteen and\r\ntwenty-three inclusive. This would not represent militarism, but an\r\nantidote against militarism. It would not represent a great expense. On\r\nthe contrary, it would mean to give to every citizen of our country an\r\neducation which would fit him to do his work as a citizen as no other\r\ntype of education could.\r\n\r\nThere are some nations with which there would not be the slightest\r\ndifficulty in going much further than this. The time has now come when\r\nit would be perfectly safe to enter into universal arbitration treaties\r\nwith the British Empire, for example, reserving such rights only as\r\nAustralia and Canada themselves would reserve inside the British\r\nEmpire; but there are a number of outside peoples with whom it would\r\nnot be safe to go much further than above outlined. If we only made\r\nthis one kind of agreement, we could keep it, and we should make no\r\nagreement that we would not and could not keep. More essential than\r\nanything else is it for us to remember that in matters of this kind\r\nan ounce of practical performance is worth a ton of windy rhetorical\r\npromises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN AMERICAN CONGRESS\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 18, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThe election of a Republican Congress a fortnight ago was first and\r\nforemost a victory for straight Americanism. To the Republican Party\r\nit represents not so much a victory as an opportunity. To the American\r\npeople, including not only Republicans and independents, but all\r\npatriotic Democrats who put loyalty to the Nation above servility to\r\na political leader, the victory was primarily won for straight-out\r\nAmericanism. A very important feature to remember is that this victory\r\nwas won in the West. On the whole, the East also showed gains, but\r\nthe greatest gains were in the West. The South, of course, and most\r\nunfortunately, never permits its political or patriotic convictions to\r\nalter the result at the ballot box.\r\n\r\nNow the Westerners, the strong, masterful, self-reliant men who won\r\nsuch exacting victories in Kansas, Minnesota, Colorado, Wyoming, and\r\nSouth Dakota, are just as opposed to what may be called Kaiserism in\r\nour political and industrial life as they are to Bolshevism. I firmly\r\nbelieve that this is true of the rank and file of the Republican Party\r\neverywhere. They haven’t the slightest patience with Townleyism in\r\nagricultural districts or I.W.W.-ism in labor circles. But resolutely\r\nthey intend to shape our internal policy for the real substantial\r\nbenefit of the average man, of the ninety per cent of our people\r\nwho are farmers, working-men, small shopkeepers, doctors, and the\r\nlike. They haven’t the slightest patience with the Bolshevist desire\r\nto establish proletariat class tyranny, which is just as odious as\r\naristocratic class tyranny. They haven’t the slightest patience in\r\npersecution of, or failure generously to reward, the man who by nature\r\nor by training is a leader in industrial matters. They want to see\r\nfarming, for instance, offer a chance to the man of ability to become a\r\nscientific farmer on a large scale. They wish to see the young business\r\nman whose leadership in manufactures or commerce is of incalculable\r\nworth to everybody receive in generous fashion the big reward to which\r\nhe is entitled.\r\n\r\nBut they wish to do all this as an incident to securing not only\r\nthis right to, but a much better chance for, the average man. They\r\nwish the tenant farmer class to be made a diminishing instead of an\r\nincreasing class so that tenant farming itself may not be a permanent\r\nstatus, but a step toward farm ownership by the hired man or the\r\nson of the small farm owner. They wish to see the working-man, and\r\nespecially the working-man in such huge businesses as those connected\r\nwith transportation, steel production, mining, and the like, become\r\nnot a mere cog in an industrial machine, but a man whose self-respect\r\nand reasonable prosperity are guaranteed if the business succeeds,\r\nand he is entitled through representation on the directory to have\r\nhis voice heard at the council board of the business, even although\r\nat first and until the ability to use power is slowly developed by\r\nthe habit of using it, the control may have to do primarily with the\r\nthings of which he has special knowledge and in which he has special\r\ninterest. Moreover, there are plenty of great natural resources, such\r\nas water power, where small ownership cannot provide capital for the\r\ndevelopment, but where the outright ownership of the people should not\r\nbe disposed of. The happy line must be struck between the all-pervading\r\nstraight regimentation, which would be as deadening as paralysis, and\r\nthe regimentation of mere individualism. The Government must exercise\r\ncontrol in a spirit of justice to all concerned and with a stern\r\nreadiness to check injustice by any of those concerned.\r\n\r\nThe Republican leadership in Congress has on the whole been singularly\r\npatriotic and singularly free from the vice of mere partisanship during\r\nthe lifetime of the present Congress. We can be certain that it will\r\ncontinue to be so in the new Congress. In the future as in the past\r\nthe President can count on the hearty and ungrudging support of the\r\nRepublican Party at every point where he is endeavoring efficiently\r\nand in good faith to serve the interests of the Nation. But he can\r\nalso rest assured that the Republican Party will judge its duty by\r\nthe standard of loyalty to the country and will scornfully refuse\r\nto adopt that extreme baseness of attitude, worthy only of slaves,\r\nwhich shrieks that we must stand by the Administration whether the\r\nAdministration is right or wrong. Moreover, the Republican Party will\r\ncertainly demand to have an accounting of some of the enormous sums of\r\nmoney that have been expended and will in due time doubtless demand\r\nto know what explanation there is of the Administration’s persistence\r\nin hidden and secret diplomacy in so many important matters. Every\r\nquestion will be approached from the standpoint of a generous desire,\r\nwithout any higgling or dealing on small points, to do whatever the\r\nAdministration demands that is proper and to give it a full chance to\r\ndeclare, and perhaps develop, its policy; but the Republican Congress\r\nwill understand how to show that it is not a rubber-stamp body, but an\r\nintegral and self-respecting part of the American governmental system,\r\nwholly and solely responsible to the American people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FREEDOM OF THE SEAS AND THE ENSLAVEMENT OF MANKIND\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 22, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThe surest way to kill a great cause is to reduce it to a hard-and-fast\r\nformula and insist upon the application of the formula without regard\r\nto actual existing conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is announced in the press that the President is going to the Peace\r\nConference especially to insist, among other things, on that one of his\r\nfourteen points dealing with the so-called “freedom of the seas.” The\r\nPresident’s position in the matter is, of course, eagerly championed by\r\nGermany, as it has been Germany’s special position throughout the war.\r\nIt is, of course, eagerly championed by the New York World, the Hearst\r\npapers, and all the rubber-stamp gentry. It is antagonized by England\r\nand France and by every anti-German in America who understands the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nIt is utterly impossible, in view of the immense rapidity of the change\r\nin modern war conditions, to formulate abstract policies about such\r\nmatters as contraband and blockades. These policies must be actually\r\ntested in order to see how they work. Both England and the United\r\nStates have reversed themselves in this matter on several different\r\noccasions. This is interesting as a matter of history, but from no\r\nother standpoint. If we are honorable and intelligent we will follow\r\nthe course in this matter which, under existing conditions at this\r\ntime, seems most likely to work justice in the immediate future.\r\n\r\nGermany’s position was that England had no right to blockade her so as\r\nto cut off her supplies from the outside world. President Wilson at\r\nthe time accepted this view and talked a good deal about the freedom\r\nof the seas. Meanwhile Germany, through her submarines, began an\r\nunprecedented course of wholesale murder on the seas. President Wilson\r\nprotested against this in language much more apologetic and tender than\r\nhe had used in protesting against Great Britain blockading Germany in\r\nwhat was essentially the same manner in which we blockaded the South\r\nduring the Civil War. He put the dollar above the man and incidentally\r\nabove the women and the children. He protested more vigorously upon the\r\ninterference with American goods than against the taking of American\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nThen we finally went to war with Germany ourselves. We instantly\r\nadopted toward Germany and toward neutrals like Holland exactly the\r\nposition which President Wilson had been denouncing England for\r\nadopting toward Germany and toward us. Our action in this case was\r\nquite right, whereas our protest against England’s action had been\r\nentirely wrong.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson now proposes to accept the German view and provide a\r\nsystem which, if it had been in existence in 1914, would have meant\r\nthe inevitable and rapid triumph of Germany.\r\n\r\nIf this particular one of the proposed fourteen points had been in\r\ntreaty form and had been lived up to in 1914, Germany would have had\r\nfree access to the outside world. England’s fleet would not have\r\nenabled her to bring economic pressure to bear upon Germany and\r\ndoubtless Germany would have won an overwhelming victory within a\r\ncouple of years. Therefore Mr. Wilson’s proposal is that now, when\r\nno human being can foretell whether Germany will feel chastened and\r\nmorally changed, we shall take steps which will mean that if the war\r\nhas to be fought over again, Germany’s triumph will have been secured\r\nin advance so far as we are able to secure it. All such conditions, all\r\nmerely academic questions as to the attitude of America or of England\r\nbefore the outbreak of the Great War, are insignificant. Whatever our\r\nviews prior to the Great War, we are fools, indeed, if we have not\r\nlearned the lessons these last four and a half terrible years have\r\ntaught. The freedom of the seas in the sense used by Germany and Mr.\r\nWilson would have meant the enslavement of mankind to Germany. It\r\nwould have meant that this country would at this time either be lying\r\nprostrate under the feet of German invaders or be purchasing peace by\r\nransoms heavier than were paid by Belgium. No patriotic American has\r\nthe right to stand quiet and see the President of the country, without\r\nany warrant from the country, try to bring upon us such outrageous\r\npotentiality and disaster as would be implied in the general\r\ninternational adoption of the so-called “freedom of the seas.” Such\r\nfreedom of the seas means the enslavement of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT WILSON AND THE PEACE CONFERENCE\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 26, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nNo public end of any kind will be served by President Wilson’s going\r\nwith Mr. Creel, Mr. House, and his other personal friends to the\r\nPeace Conference. Inasmuch as the circumstances of his going are so\r\nextraordinary, and as there is some possibility of mischief to this\r\ncountry as a result, there are certain facts which should be set forth\r\nso clearly that there can be no possibility of misunderstanding either\r\nby our own people, by our allies, or by our beaten enemies, or by Mr.\r\nWilson himself.\r\n\r\nTen days before election Mr. Wilson issued an appeal to the American\r\npeople in which he frankly abandoned the position of President of the\r\nwhole people; assumed the position, not merely of party leader, but\r\nof party dictator, and appealed to the voters as such. Most of Mr.\r\nWilson’s utterances on public questions have been susceptible to at\r\nleast two conflicting interpretations. But on this question he made the\r\nissue absolutely clear. He asked that the people return a Democratic\r\nmajority to both the Senate and the House of Representatives. He\r\nstated that the Republican leaders were pro-war, but that they were\r\nanti-Administration. His appeal was not merely against any Republican\r\nbeing elected, but against any Democrat who wished to retain his\r\nconscience in his own keeping. He declared himself explicitly\r\nagainst the pro-war Republicans. He declared explicitly for all\r\npro-Administration Democrats, without any reference as to whether\r\nthey were pro-war or anti-war. He said that if the people approved of\r\nhis leadership and wished him to continue to be their “unembarrassed\r\nspokesman in affairs at home and abroad, they must return a Democratic\r\nmajority to both the Senate and the House of Representatives.” He\r\nexplicitly stated that on the other side of the water the return of a\r\nRepublican majority to either House of Congress would be interpreted\r\nas a repudiation of his leadership, and informed his fellow countrymen\r\nthat to elect a Democratic majority in Congress was the only way to\r\nsustain him, Mr. Wilson.\r\n\r\nThe issue was perfectly, clearly drawn. The Republican Party was\r\npro-war and anti-Administration, the Democratic Party was officially\r\npro-Administration without any mind or conscience of its own and\r\npro-war or anti-war according to the way in which Mr. Wilson changed\r\nhis mind overnight or between dawn and sunset. The Americans refused to\r\nsustain Mr. Wilson. They elected a heavily Republican House and to the\r\nsurprise of every one carried a majority in the Senate. On Mr. Wilson’s\r\nown say-so they repudiated his leadership. In no other free country in\r\nthe world to-day would Mr. Wilson be in office. He would simply be a\r\nprivate citizen like the rest of us.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances our allies and our enemies, and Mr. Wilson\r\nhimself, should all understand that Mr. Wilson has no authority\r\nwhatever to speak for the American people at this time. His leadership\r\nhas just been emphatically repudiated by them. The newly elected\r\nCongress comes far nearer than Mr. Wilson to having a right to speak\r\nthe purposes of the American people at this moment. Mr. Wilson and\r\nhis fourteen points and his four supplementary points and his five\r\ncomplementary points and all his utterances every which way have ceased\r\nto have any shadow of right to be accepted as expressive of the will\r\nof the American people. He is President of the United States, he is\r\npart of the treaty-making power, but he is only part. If he acts in\r\ngood faith to the American people, he will not claim on the other\r\nside of the water any representative capacity in himself to speak for\r\nthe American people. He will say frankly that his personal leadership\r\nhas been repudiated and that he now has merely the divided official\r\nleadership which he shares with the Senate. If he will in good faith\r\nact in this way all good citizens in good faith will support him, just\r\nas they will support the Senate under similar circumstances.\r\n\r\nBut there isn’t the slightest indication that he intends so to act.\r\nThe most striking manifestation of his purpose is that he sent over\r\nMr. Creel and sixteen of his employees who are officially announced\r\nas “the United States official press mission to the Peace Conference,”\r\nand, with more self-satisfaction, the committee announces, “to\r\ninterpret the work of the Peace Conference by keeping up world-wide\r\npropaganda to disseminate American accomplishments and American\r\nideals.” At the same time Mr. Burleson seized the cables after the war\r\nis over and when there can be no possible object except to control\r\nthe news in the interest of President Wilson as Mr. Burleson and Mr.\r\nCreel see that interest. The action of the Creel “official press” would\r\nreally seem more like an excessively bad joke if it weren’t so serious.\r\nBut during the war the Administration, often incompetent to the verge\r\nof impudence in dealing with war problems and with the Hun within our\r\ngates, showed itself a past-master in bullying, browbeating, deceiving,\r\nand puzzling our own people. It is utterly impossible that the Creel\r\n“official press” and the Burleson-owned cables can have any other real\r\npurpose than to make the news sent out from the Peace Conference, both\r\nto ourselves, our allies, and our enemies, what they desire to have\r\ntold from their own standpoint and nothing more.\r\n\r\nThis is a very grave offense against our own people, but it may be a\r\nworse offense against both our allies and ourselves. America played\r\nin the closing months of the war a gallant part, but not in any way\r\nthe leading part, and she played this part only by acting in strictest\r\nagreement with our allies and under the joint high command. She should\r\ntake precisely the same attitude at the Peace Conference. We have lost\r\nin this war about two hundred and thirty-six thousand men killed and\r\nwounded. England and France have lost about seven million. Italy and\r\nBelgium and the other Allies have doubtless lost three million more.\r\nOf the terrible sacrifice which has enabled the Allies to win the\r\nvictory, America has contributed just about two per cent. At the end,\r\nI personally believe that our intervention was decisive because the\r\ncombatants were so equally matched and were so weakened by the terrible\r\nstrain that our money and our enthusiasm and the million fighting\r\nmen whom we got to the front, even although armed substantially with\r\nnothing but French field cannon, tanks, machine guns, and airplanes,\r\nwas decisive in the scale. But we could render this decisive aid only\r\nbecause for four years the Allies, in keeping Germany from conquering\r\ntheir own countries, had incidentally kept her from conquering ours.\r\n\r\nIt is our business to act with our allies and to show an undivided\r\nfront with them against any move of our late enemies. I am no Utopian.\r\nI understand entirely that there can be shifting alliances, I\r\nunderstand entirely that twenty years hence or thirty years hence we\r\ndon’t know what combination we may have to face, and for this reason\r\nI wish to see us preparing our own strength in advance and trust to\r\nnothing but our own strength for our own self-defense as our permanent\r\npolicy. But in the present war we have won only by standing shoulder\r\nto shoulder with our allies and presenting an undivided front to the\r\nenemy. It is our business to show the same loyalty and good faith at\r\nthe Peace Conference. Let it be clearly understood that the American\r\npeople absolutely stand behind France, England, Italy, Belgium, and the\r\nother Allies at the Peace Conference, just as she has stood with them\r\nduring the last eighteen months of war. Let every difference of opinion\r\nbe settled among the Allies themselves and then let them impose their\r\ncommon will on the nations responsible for the hideous disaster which\r\nhas almost wrecked mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEAGUE TO ENFORCE PEACE\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 2, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nEx-Ambassador Harry White is a capital appointee for the Peace\r\nCommission. He is not a Republican, but an independent in politics who\r\nhas worked as closely with Mr. Cleveland and Mr. Olney as with Mr.\r\nMcKinley and Mr. Root.\r\n\r\nIt is a good thing to have him on in view of the exceedingly loose talk\r\nabout the League of Nations or League to Enforce Peace. Fortunately\r\nMr. Taft has set forth the proposal for such a league under existing\r\nconditions with such wisdom in refusing to let adherence to the\r\nprinciple be clouded by insistence upon improper or unimportant methods\r\nof enforcement that we can speak of the League as a practical matter.\r\nI think that most of our people are in favor of the establishment of\r\nthe principle of such a league under common-sense conditions which will\r\nnot attempt too much and thereby expose the movement to the absolute\r\ncertainty of ridicule and failure. There must be an honest effort\r\nto eliminate some of the causes that may produce future wars and to\r\nminimize the area of such wars.\r\n\r\nMr. Taft explicitly admits and insists that the League is to be a\r\nsupplement to, and in no sense a substitute for, the duty of our Nation\r\nto prepare its own strength for its own defense. He also explicitly\r\nprovides that, among the various peoples who would not be admitted to\r\nthe League on an equality with the others, there shall be different\r\nspheres of interest assumed by the different powers who have entered\r\ninto the League. For example, the affairs of hither Asia, the Balkan\r\nPeninsula, and of North Africa are of prime concern to the powers of\r\nEurope, and the United States should be under no covenant to go to\r\nwar about matters in which its people have no concern and probably\r\nno intelligent interest. On the other hand, the Monroe Doctrine--at\r\nleast for all America between the equator and the southern boundary of\r\nthe United States--is a vital point of American policy, and must in\r\nno shape or way be interfered with. We do not interfere with existing\r\nconditions, but aside from these no European or Asiatic power is to\r\nhave any say-so in the future of Mexico, Central America, and the lands\r\nwhose coasts are washed by the Caribbean Sea. The Panama Canal must not\r\nbe internationalized. It is our canal; we built it; we fortified it,\r\nand we will protect it, and we will not permit our enemies to use it in\r\nwar. In time of peace all nations shall use it alike, but in time of\r\nwar our interest at once becomes dominant.\r\n\r\nMost wisely Mr. Taft’s plan reserves for each nation certain matters\r\nof such vital national interest that they cannot be put before any\r\ninternational tribunal. This country must settle its own tariff and\r\nindustrial policies, and the question of admitting immigrants to work\r\nor to citizenship, and all similar matters, the exercise of which was\r\nclaimed as a right when in 1776 we became an independent Nation. We\r\nwill not surrender our independence to a league of nations any more\r\nthan to a single nation. Moreover, no international court must be\r\nentrusted with the decision of what is and what is not justiciable.\r\n\r\nIn the articles of agreement the non-justiciable matters should be as\r\nsharply defined as possible, and until some better plan can be devised,\r\nthe Nation itself must reserve to itself the right, as each case\r\narises, to say what these matters are.\r\n\r\nBut let us steadily remember that before dealing with schemes such as\r\nthe League of Nations, which are necessarily more or less visionary,\r\nwe must join in good faith with our allies in securing practical right\r\nand justice at the Peace Conference. We should treat as an enemy to\r\nthis country every man who at this time seeks directly or indirectly\r\nto stir up dissension between us and England or France, or any other\r\nof our allies. Side by side we have fought against the hideous twin\r\nterrors of Bolshevism and Kaiserism and we must stand undivided at the\r\nPeace Conference. What the distant future may hold no man can say, and\r\nthis is the very reason why I insist that America must prepare its own\r\nstrength for its own defense. But our duty at the moment is clear. We\r\nhave fought the war through beside the Allies and we must stand with\r\nthem with hearty loyalty throughout the peace negotiations. There must\r\nbe no division in the face of our enemies. At the very close of the war\r\nwe played an honorable and probably decisive part, but we were enabled\r\nto do so only because for the four preceding years England and France\r\nand their associates in defending their own rights had also saved us\r\nfrom destruction. Our sacrifice is infinitesimal compared to theirs.\r\nWe have had a quarter of a million men killed and wounded; England\r\nhas had over three million, France nearly four million, and the other\r\nAllies during their time of warfare against the common foe suffered in\r\nproportion. Our loss has been no more than one or two per cent of the\r\nentire loss suffered by the Allied armies and navies.\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause of bringing the war to an end was the forcing of\r\nunconditional surrender upon Bulgaria and Turkey, with whom we had\r\nshamefully refused to go to war at all. The English navy protected us\r\nexactly as it protected Britain. Under such circumstances it behooves\r\nus to remember that while we at the very end did our duty, yet that\r\nour comrades in arms for over four years performed incalculable feats\r\nand suffered incalculable losses and won the right of gratitude of all\r\nmankind. The American envoys must not sit at the peace table as umpires\r\nbetween the Allies and the conquered Central Powers, but as loyal\r\nbrothers of the Allies, as loyal members of the league of free peoples,\r\nwhich has brought about peace by overthrowing Turkey, Bulgaria, and\r\nAustria, and beating Germany to her knees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEN WHOSE LOT HAS BEEN HARDEST\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 8, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThere recently died of pneumonia in France Major Willard Straight, of\r\nthe American army. He was above the draft age, he was a man of large\r\nand many interests, he had a wife and three children. There was every\r\nexcuse for him not to have gone to the front, but both he and his wife\r\nhad in their souls that touch of heroism which makes it impossible for\r\ngenerous natures to see others pay with their bodies and not to wish\r\nto do so themselves. The one regret that Major Straight felt--and he\r\nfelt it most bitterly--was that he had not been able in spite of all\r\nhis efforts to get to the actual firing front. This failure was really\r\na cause of great anguish of soul to him. In the same way I know of the\r\nfour sons of an ex-Cabinet officer, all of whom instantly went into\r\nthe army at the outbreak of the war. Two were at the fighting front,\r\none was in the navy, and the other, because of the special excellence\r\nas an instructor, was kept here, and the gallant young fellow who\r\nleft his wife and baby to enlist really feels as if the refusal of\r\nthe War Department to permit him to go where he could be shot at had\r\ncaused a blight in his life. I know three other men who, because of\r\ntheir excellence, were kept as instructors at one of our camps, whose\r\nfeelings of regret are so bitter that they can hardly bear to look at\r\ntheir uniforms and the sight of wounded soldiers causes them agonies of\r\nthwarted longing.\r\n\r\nAll this is most natural, and just what we should expect from\r\nhigh-minded, gallant fellows. But it is entirely unwarranted. I utterly\r\nabhor the swivel-chair slacker who got some safe job in order to avoid\r\ndoing his duty at the front. But for the hundreds of thousands of\r\nyoung Americans in the ranks or with commissions who did everything\r\nthey could to get in the firing lines, and who through no fault of\r\ntheirs failed, I have precisely the same feeling that I have for the\r\nmen who took part in the most dangerous work. General Leonard Wood,\r\nin his recent capital address, has taught the right lesson to these\r\nmen. He was dismissing to their homes the men whom he had trained\r\nwith his usual, extraordinary capacity to fit them for work overseas,\r\nand he dwelt to them upon the fact that the all-important point was\r\nthat they should remember that it was not the position they achieved,\r\nbut the eager readiness to do duty in whatever position they were\r\ngiven that really counted. General Wood has himself been treated\r\nwith the most cruel injustice in this war, yet he has rendered signal\r\nservice in bringing before Congress our military needs, and, above\r\nall, in training scores of thousands of our best fighting men. When\r\nhe was denied, from the very meanest motives, the chance to fill a\r\ndistinguished position, instead of sulking he devoted all of his\r\nenergy to doing the best he could in the positions to which he was\r\nassigned. In consequence he comes out of the war as one of those who\r\nmost materially helped to win it. What is true of him in a big place\r\nis true of every other soldier, whether in a big or little place. The\r\nhardest task was for the men who were denied the chance of glory, and\r\nif they did this hard task well and served faithfully wherever they\r\nwere assigned, they have exactly the same right for pride in their\r\nparticipation in the Great War as any of the gallant fellows who have\r\ncome back maimed or crippled from the front. All alike have made the\r\nrest of us forever their debtors, and to all alike we pay the same meed\r\nof loyal admiration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH NAVY, THE FRENCH ARMY, AND AMERICAN COMMON SENSE\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 17, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first essential in an alliance is loyalty. The first effort of an\r\nenemy to an alliance is to produce disloyalty to one another among the\r\nAllies. To any man who knows anything of history these facts are of\r\nbromidic triteness. But the Administration, as usual, stands in urgent\r\nneed of learning the elements of fair play and common sense.\r\n\r\nIt was announced from the peace ship that President Wilson was going\r\nto work for the reduction of naval armaments and for a form of naval\r\nagreement which, if it had existed four years ago, would have meant\r\nGermany’s victory and the subjugation of not only Germany’s foes,\r\nbut of all neutrals like ourselves. At the same time over here the\r\nrepresentatives of the Administration are demanding a navy bigger than\r\nthat of Great Britain. The only possible interpretation of these facts\r\nis that the Administration proposes to threaten Great Britain with\r\nhaving to get in a neck-and-neck competition with America to build the\r\ngreatest navy in the world, and to do this as a bluff so as to make for\r\nGreat Britain’s adherence to Mr. Wilson’s exceedingly nebulous ideas.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions the American people should, with common sense,\r\nlook at what their own needs are and at what the needs of their\r\nallies are. Sooner or later any programme will have to be tested by\r\nits results, and even if the United States started to emulate Great\r\nBritain’s navy, the enthusiasm to do so would vanish when it appeared\r\nthat there was no earthly interest of ours to be served by the action.\r\n\r\nIn winning the present war very many instrumentalities have been\r\nnecessary. On the whole the four most important in their order have\r\nbeen: (1) the French army; (2) the British navy; (3) the British army;\r\n(4) the Italian army. Our own gallant army and navy did exceedingly\r\nwell, but came in so late that the part they played, taking the four\r\nand a half years as a whole, does not entitle them to rank with the\r\ninstrumentalities given above.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain is an island, separated from the huge military\r\ncommonwealths of Europe by very narrow seas, and separated from her\r\nown greatest colonies by all the greatest oceans. To her, supremacy\r\nin the navy is a matter of life and death. America ought to have a\r\nfirst-class navy, but if she did not have a ship she might yet secure\r\nherself from any invasion. But Great Britain’s empire would not last\r\none week, and she could not make herself safe at home one week if her\r\nnavy lost its supremacy. Incidentally to saving herself, the British\r\nnavy has rendered incalculable service to us during the last four and\r\none-half years, and for the last thirty years has been a shield to\r\nthe United States. Great Britain is not a military power in the sense\r\nthat any of the nations of continental Europe, or indeed of Asia, are\r\nmilitary powers. She had almost as much difficulty in developing her\r\narmy in this war as we had in developing our army. Her army is no more\r\nof a threat to other peoples than ours is. Therefore, we Americans\r\nfind ourselves, as regards the British navy, in this position, that it\r\nis of vital consequence to Great Britain to have the greatest navy in\r\nthe world; it is emphatically not of any consequence to us to have as\r\nbig a navy as Great Britain, for we are not in the slightest danger\r\nfrom Great Britain, and under all ordinary circumstances the British\r\nnavy can be counted upon as a help to the United States and never as\r\na menace. Under such circumstances to set ourselves to work to build\r\na navy in rivalry to Great Britain’s, and above all to do this as a\r\npolitical bluff, is worse than silly.\r\n\r\nOur own navy should be ample to protect our own coasts and to maintain\r\nthe Monroe Doctrine. There are in Europe and Asia several great\r\nmilitary commonwealths, each one of which will in all probability\r\nalways possess a far more formidable army than ours, even though, as\r\nI earnestly hope, we adopt some development of universal military\r\ntraining on the lines of the Swiss system. Therefore, it is of the\r\nhighest consequence that our navy should be second to that of Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nThe analogy with the case of the French army is complete. If the French\r\narmy had not been able to hold the German army and be the chief factor\r\nin the German military overthrow, the British navy could not have\r\naverted Germany’s complete victory. Great Britain is separated by the\r\nnarrow seas from the military powers of continental Europe. We are\r\nseparated from them by the width of the ocean. Under the circumstances,\r\nit is sheer impertinence for either American or English statesmen\r\nto tell France, or, for that matter Italy, what ought to be done in\r\nabolishing armaments or abandoning universal service or anything of\r\nthe kind. The interest of France and Italy in the matter is vital.\r\nThe interest of England and America is partly secondary. If we have\r\nwell-thought-out arguments to put before the French, put them before\r\nthem, but treat France as having the vital interest in the matter, and\r\ntherefore the final say-so as far as we are concerned. And when France\r\nhas determined what the needs of the future demand, so far as her\r\nmilitary preparedness is concerned, and when Italy has made a similar\r\ndetermination, and our other allies likewise, back them up. It is not\r\nthe business of America to tell Great Britain what she should do with\r\nher navy. It is not the business of either America or England to tell\r\nFrance what she should do with her army. The plain American common\r\nsense of the situation is that we should recognize our immense debt\r\nto the British navy and the French army, and stand by Britain in what\r\nshe decides her vital needs demand so far as her navy is concerned,\r\nand stand by France in the position she takes as to what the situation\r\ndemands so far as her army is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLET US HAVE STRAIGHTFORWARD SPEAKING\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 24, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nSenator Lodge in his admirable speech has given the reasons why at\r\nleast five of the famous fourteen points should not be considered in\r\nthe peace negotiations proper. But the special merit of Senator Lodge’s\r\nstatement lies in the fact that it is straightforward and clear. There\r\nis no need of a key to find out what he means. The men who represent,\r\nor assume to represent, the United States at the Peace Conference,\r\nshould be equally clear with our allies and our enemies and also with\r\nthe American people. Above all things we need some straightforward\r\nstatement as to just what is proposed and as to just why it is proposed.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, the very extraordinary conflict between that one\r\nof the fourteen points in which the Administration has demanded\r\npractically complete disarmament and the action of the Administration\r\nat the same moment demanding that we shall build the biggest navy in\r\nthe world. Either one course or the other must necessarily be improper.\r\nIn such a matter we especially need a straightforward statement of\r\nreasons and principles.\r\n\r\nThe worst thing we could do would be to build a spite navy, a navy\r\nbuilt not to meet our own needs, but to spite some one else. I am\r\nspeaking purely as an American. No man in this country who is both\r\nintelligent or informed has the slightest fear that Great Britain will\r\never invade us or try to go to war with us. The British navy is not in\r\nthe slightest degree a menace to us. I can go a little further than\r\nthis. There is in Great Britain a large pacifist and defeatist party\r\nwhich behaves exactly like our own pacifists, pro-Germans, Germanized\r\nSocialists, defeatists, and Bolsheviki. If this party had its way and\r\nGreat Britain abandoned its fleet, I should feel, so far from the\r\nUnited States being freed from the necessity of building up a fleet,\r\nthat it behooved us to build a much stronger one than is at present\r\nnecessary. Our need is not as great as that of the vast scattered\r\nBritish Empire, for our domains are pretty much in a ring fence. We\r\nought not to undertake the task of policing Europe, Asia, and Northern\r\nAfrica. Neither ought we to permit any interference with the Monroe\r\nDoctrine or any attempt by Europe or Asia to police America. Mexico is\r\nour Balkan Peninsula. Some day we will have to deal with it. All the\r\ncoasts and islands which in any way approach the Panama Canal must be\r\ndealt with by this Nation, and by this Nation alone, in accordance with\r\nthe Monroe Doctrine. With this object in view our navy should be second\r\nto that of Great Britain and superior to that of any other power--and\r\nif Great Britain chooses to abolish its navy it would mean that we\r\nought to build a larger navy than is now necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SQUARE DEAL FOR THE MEN AT THE FRONT\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 25, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\nWe should show our respect for the men at the front by more than mere\r\nadulation. They are the Americans who have done most and suffered most\r\nfor this country. It was announced in the press that in many cases they\r\nand the families they have left behind have not for months received\r\ntheir full pay. This is an outrage. All civil officials are paid. The\r\nSecretary of War is paid, and he ought not to touch a dollar of his\r\nsalary and no high official should touch a dollar of his salary until\r\nthe enlisted men and junior officers are paid every cent that is owing\r\nto them, and this payment should be prompt. There is literally no\r\nexcuse for even so much as three days’ delay in the payment.\r\n\r\nMoreover, these men, at great cost to themselves in paying everything\r\nincluding, in fifty or sixty thousand cases, their lives, have gone to\r\nthe front at a wage from one half to one fifth as great as that their\r\ncompanions who stayed behind have received during the same period.\r\nThey enlisted to do a specific job. They made the sacrifice in order\r\nto do that job. We on our side should see that just as soon as the job\r\nis done the men are taken home, allowed to leave the army, and begin\r\nearning their livelihood and take care of the wives and children that\r\nthe married ones among them have left behind.\r\n\r\nRecently in the public press there have appeared various artless and\r\nchatty statements from the State, War, and Navy departments that our\r\nmen might be kept in Europe to do general police work and might not be\r\nbrought back here until the summer of 1920. There are three types of\r\nsoldiers on the other side. There are the Regular Army men, who have\r\nentered the Regular Army as a profession, and to whom it is a matter\r\nof indifference whether they stay in Europe, come back here, go to the\r\nPhilippines, or do anything else. That is a small proportion of our\r\nforce on the other side. The bulk are divided between volunteers, who\r\nenlisted in the National Guard or sometimes in the regular regiments\r\nto fight this war through, and the drafted men who were put into the\r\narmy under a law designed to meet this war and this war only. Not\r\none in ten of the volunteers would have dreamed of volunteering to\r\ndo police work in European squabbles. Not ten Congressmen would have\r\nvoted for the Draft Law if it was to force selective men to do police\r\nduty after the war was over. All these men went in to fight this war\r\nthrough to a finish and then to come home. It is not a square deal to\r\nfollow any other course as regards them. The minute that peace comes\r\nevery American soldier on the other side should be brought home as\r\nspeedily as possible save, of course, the regulars who make the Regular\r\nArmy their life profession, and any other man who chose to volunteer\r\nto go over, or who can with entire propriety be used for gathering up\r\nthe loose ends. The American fighting man at the front has given this\r\ncountry a square deal during the war. Now let the country give him a\r\nsquare deal by letting him get out of the army and go to his home as\r\nsoon as the war is finished. The Red Cross has done wonderful work in\r\ntaking care of the dependents of these men pending settlement by the\r\nGovernment, but the Government should not be content to rely on any\r\noutside organization to make up its own shortcomings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEAGUE OF NATIONS[2]\r\n\r\nJANUARY 13, 1919\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, a serious misfortune that our people are not getting\r\na clear idea of what is happening on the other side. For the moment the\r\npoint as to which we are foggy is the League of Nations. We all of us\r\nearnestly desire such a league, only we wish to be sure that it will\r\nhelp and not hinder the cause of world peace and justice. There is not\r\na young man in this country who has fought, or an old man who has seen\r\nthose dear to him fight, who does not wish to minimize the chance of\r\nfuture war. But there is not a man of sense who does not know that in\r\nany such movement if too much is attempted the result is either failure\r\nor worse than failure.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with Mr. Wilson’s utterances, so far as they are reported,\r\nand the utterances of acquiescence in them by European statesmen, is\r\nthat they are still absolutely in the stage of rhetoric precisely\r\nlike the “fourteen points.” Some of the fourteen points will probably\r\nhave to be construed as having a mischievous significance, a smaller\r\nnumber might be construed as being harmless, and one or two even as\r\nbeneficial, but nobody knows what Mr. Wilson really means by them,\r\nand so all talk of adopting them as basis for a peace or a league is\r\nnonsense and, if the talker is intelligent, it is insincere nonsense\r\nto boot. So Mr. Wilson’s recent utterances give us absolutely no\r\nclue as to whether he really intends that at this moment we shall\r\nadmit Germany, Russia,--with which, incidentally, we are still waging\r\nwar,--Turkey, China, and Mexico into the League on full equality with\r\nourselves. Mr. Taft has recently defined the purposes of the League and\r\nthe limitations under which it would act, in a way that enables most of\r\nus to say we very heartily agree in principle with his theory and can,\r\nwithout doubt, come to an agreement on specific details.\r\n\r\nWould it not be well to begin with the League which we actually have\r\nin existence, the League of the Allies who have fought through this\r\ngreat war? Let us at the peace table see that real justice is done as\r\namong these Allies, and that while the sternest reparation is demanded\r\nfrom our foes for such horrors as those committed in Belgium, Northern\r\nFrance, Armenia, and the sinking of the Lusitania, nothing should be\r\ndone in the spirit of mere vengeance. Then let us agree to extend the\r\nprivileges of the League, as rapidly as their conduct warrants it, to\r\nother nations, doubtless discriminating between those who would have a\r\nguiding part in the League and the weak nations who would be entitled\r\nto the privileges of membership, but who would not be entitled to a\r\nguiding voice in the councils. Let each nation reserve to itself and\r\nfor its own decision, and let it clearly set forth questions which\r\nare non-justiciable. Let nothing be done that will interfere with our\r\npreparing for our own defense by introducing a system of universal\r\nobligatory military training modeled on the Swiss plan.\r\n\r\nFinally make it perfectly clear that we do not intend to take a\r\nposition of international Meddlesome Matty. The American people do\r\nnot wish to go into an overseas war unless for a very great cause and\r\nwhere the issue is absolutely plain. Therefore, we do not wish to\r\nundertake the responsibility of sending our gallant young men to die\r\nin obscure fights in the Balkans or in Central Europe, or in a war\r\nwe do not approve of. Moreover, the American people do not intend to\r\ngive up the Monroe Doctrine. Let civilized Europe and Asia introduce\r\nsome kind of police system in the weak and disorderly countries at\r\ntheir thresholds. But let the United States treat Mexico as our Balkan\r\nPeninsula and refuse to allow European or Asiatic powers to interfere\r\non this continent in any way that implies permanent or semi-permanent\r\npossession. Every one of our allies will with delight grant this\r\nrequest if President Wilson chooses to make it, and it will be a great\r\nmisfortune if it is not made.\r\n\r\nI believe that such an effort made moderately and sanely, but sincerely\r\nand with utter scorn for words that are not made good by deeds, will be\r\nproductive of real and lasting international good.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] This article on “The League of Nations” is the last contribution\r\nthat Colonel Roosevelt prepared for The Star. It was dictated at\r\nhis home in Oyster Bay, January 3, the Friday before his death. His\r\nsecretary expected to take the typed copy to him for correction Monday.\r\nInstead she was called on the telephone early Monday morning and told\r\nof his death. A delay of several days naturally ensued, before the\r\neditorial reached the office of The Star.\r\n\r\nIn view of the immense moment of the issues before the Peace\r\nConference, The Star had asked Colonel Roosevelt to give his countrymen\r\nthe benefit of his discussion of the possibilities of a League of\r\nNations as a preventive of war. He consented, although, as he wrote,\r\nhe expected to follow this editorial with one “on what I regard as\r\ninfinitely more important, namely, our business to prepare for our own\r\nself-defense.” That article, however, was never written.\r\n\r\nThis article, then, his final contribution to The Star, represents his\r\nmatured judgment based on protracted discussion and correspondence. It\r\nis of peculiar importance as the last message of a man who, above every\r\nother American of his generation, combined high patriotism, practical\r\nsense, and a positive genius for international relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n THIS LARGE-PAPER EDITION CONSISTS OF THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-FIVE\r\n NUMBERED COPIES, OF WHICH THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ARE FOR SALE.
