The\r\nimpartial and independent opinion of one outside the family, both in\r\nwriting the memoir and in selecting passages from the manuscripts for\r\npublication, has been of great value.\r\n\r\nMy grateful thanks are due to His Majesty the King for giving permission to\r\npublish letters from Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\nI am also grateful to friends and relations who have placed letters at my\r\ndisposal; especially to my brother, whose helpful encouragement throughout\r\nthe work has been most valuable.\r\n\r\nMr. Justin McCarthy, who many years ago recorded his impressions of my\r\nmother in his Reminiscences, has now most kindly contributed to this book a\r\nchapter of Recollections.\r\n\r\nMy cordial thanks are also due to Mr. George Trevelyan for reading the\r\nproof sheets, and to Mr. Frederic Harrison for giving permission to publish\r\nhis Memorial Address at the end of this volume.\r\n\r\nAGATHA RUSSELL\r\n\r\nROZELDENE, HINDHEAD, SURREY\r\n\r\nOctober, 1910\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. 1815-34\r\n\r\nEarly years--Paris--Lord Minto appointed Minister at Berlin--\r\nGermany--Return to Minto\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. 1835-41\r\n\r\nLord Minto First Lord of the Admiralty--Life in London--Bowood--Mrs.\r\nDrummond's recollections--Friendship with Lord John Russell--Putney\r\nHouse--Minto--Admiralty--Her engagement\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. 1841\r\n\r\nMarriage--Sketch of Lord John's career before marriage--His conversation\r\nwith Napoleon--Moore's \"Remonstrance\"\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. 1841-45\r\n\r\nWilton Crescent--Endsleigh--Chesham Place--Birth of her eldest\r\nson--Anti-Corn Law agitation--Her illness--Lord John's letter from\r\nEdinburgh--He is summoned to Osborne--Attempts to form a Ministry\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. 1846-47\r\n\r\nIllness in Edinburgh--Letters between Lord and\r\nLady John--Repeal of the Corn Laws--Ireland and coercion--Lord John Prime\r\nMinister\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. 1847-52\r\n\r\nPembroke Lodge--Difficulties of the Ministry--Revolution in France\r\n--Chartism--Petersham School founded by Lord and Lady John--The Papal\r\nBull--Durham Letter--The Queen and Lord Palmerston--The _Coup\r\nd'État_--Breach with Palmerston--Defeat of the Russell\r\nGovernment--Literary friends\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. 1852-55\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen Prime Minister--Lord John joins Coalition Ministry--Lady\r\nJohn's misgivings--Gladstone's Budget--Death of Lady Minto--Samuel\r\nRogers--The Reform Bill--The Crimean War--Withdrawal of Reform--Roebuck's\r\nmotion--Lord John's resignation\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. 1855\r\n\r\nDefeat of Aberdeen Ministry--Lord John's Mission to Vienna--He accepts\r\nColonial Office in Palmerston Government--Vienna Conference--His\r\nresignation--Lady John's diary and letters\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. 1855-60\r\n\r\nRetirement and foreign travel--Palmerston and China--City election\r\n--Reception at Sheffield--Orsini's attempt upon Napoleon III--Italy and\r\nAustria--Lord John's share in the liberation of Italy--Lady John's\r\nenthusiasm--Garibaldi at Pembroke Lodge\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. 1859-66\r\n\r\nDeath of Lord Minto--Lord John accepts peerage--American Civil War--Death\r\nof Lord Palmerston--Lord Russell Prime Minister--Reform Bill of 1866--Mr.\r\nLowe and the \"Adullamites\"--Defeat and resignation of the Russell\r\nGovernment\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. 1866-70\r\n\r\nTravel in Italy--Entry of Victor Emmanuel into Venice--Disraeli's Reform\r\nBill--Irish Church question--Gladstone Prime Minister--Winter at San\r\nRemo--Paris--Dinner at the Tuileries--Return to England\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. 1870-78\r\n\r\nFranco-German War--Renens-sur-Roche--Education question--Cannes--Herbert\r\nSpencer--Letters from Queen Victoria--Herzegovina--Death of Lord\r\nAmberley--Nonconformist deputation at Pembroke Lodge--Death of Lord Russell\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. 1878-98\r\n\r\nLady Russell--Her love of children--Literary tastes--Friendships--\r\nCorrespondence--Haslemere--Death of Tennyson--England and Ireland--Last\r\nmeeting of Petersham Scholars--Illness and death\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nLetters from friends--Funeral at Chenies--Poem on Death\r\n\r\nRECOLLECTIONS OF LADY RUSSELL.

As a girl she lived among\r\nthose directing the changes of those times; as the wife of a Prime Minister\r\nof England unusually reticent in superficial relations but open in\r\nintimacy, in whom the qualities of administrator and politician overlay the\r\ndetachment of sensitive reflection, she came to judge men and events by\r\nprinciples drawn from deep feelings and wide surveys; and in the long years\r\nof her widowhood, possessing still great natural vitality and vivacity of\r\nfeeling, she continued open to the influences of an altered time,\r\ndelighting and astonishing many who might have expected to find between her\r\nand them the ghostly barrier of a generation.\r\n\r\nShe died in January, 1898. The span of her life covers, then, many\r\nimportant political events, and we shall catch glimpses of these as they\r\naffect her. Though the intention of the following pages is biographical,\r\nthe story of Lady Russell's life, after marriage, coincides so closely with\r\nher husband's public career that the thread connecting her letters together\r\nmust be the political events in which he took part. Some of her letters, by\r\nthrowing light on the sentiments and considerations which weighed with him\r\nat doubtful junctures, are not without value to the historian. It is not,\r\nhowever, the historian who has been chiefly considered in putting them\r\ntogether, but rather the general reader, who may find his notions of past\r\npolitics vivified and refreshed by following history in the contemporary\r\ncomments of one so passionately and so personally interested at every turn\r\nof events.\r\n\r\nAnother motive has also had a part in determining the possessors of Lady\r\nRussell's letters to publish them. Memory is the most sacred, but also the\r\nmost perishable of shrines; hence it sometimes seems well worth while to\r\nbreak through reticence to give greater permanence to precious\r\nrecollections. With this end also the following pages have been put\r\ntogether, and many small details included to help the subject of this\r\nmemoir to live again in the imagination of the reader. For from brief and\r\neven superficial contact with the living we may gain much; but the dead, if\r\nthey are to be known at all, must be known more intimately.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMinto House, where Lady Fanny was born, is beautifully situated above a\r\nsteep and wooded glen, and is only a short distance from the river Teviot.\r\nThe hills around are not like the wild rugged mountains of the Highlands,\r\nbut have a soft and tender beauty of their own. Her childhood was far more\r\nsecluded than the life that would have fallen to her lot had she been born\r\nin the next generation, for her home in Roxburghshire, in coach and\r\nturnpike days, was more remote from the central stir and business of life\r\nthan any spot in the United Kingdom at the present time. Lady Fanny used to\r\nrelate what a great event it was for the household at Minto when on very\r\nrare occasions her father brought from London a parcel of new books, which\r\nwere eagerly opened by the family and read with delight. Those were not the\r\ndays of circulating libraries, and both the old standard books on the Minto\r\nlibrary shelves and the few new ones occasionally added were read and\r\nre-read with a thoroughness rare among modern readers, surrounded by a\r\nmultiplicity of books old and new.\r\n\r\nThey were a large, young family, five boys and five girls, ranging from the\r\nages of three years old to eighteen in 1830, when her diaries begin, all\r\neager, high-spirited children, and exceptionally strong and healthy. In her\r\nearly diaries, describing day-long journeys in coaches, early starts and\r\nlate arrivals, she hardly ever mentions feeling tired, and she enjoyed the\r\nold methods of travelling infinitely more than the railway journeys of\r\nlater days, about which she felt like the Frenchman who said: \"On ne voyage\r\nplus; on arrive.\" Long wild country walks in Scotland and mountain-climbing\r\nin Switzerland were particularly delightful to her.\r\n\r\nThis stock of sound vitality stood her in good stead all her life; only\r\nduring those years which followed the birth of her eldest son does it seem\r\nto have failed her. Her life was an exceptionally busy one, and her strong\r\nfeelings and sense of responsibility made even small domestic affairs\r\nmatters for close attention; yet in the diaries and letters of her later\r\nlife there are no entries which betray either the lassitude or the\r\nrestlessness of fatigue. She was not one of those busy women who only keep\r\npace with their interests by deputing home management to others. This power\r\nof endurance in a deeply feeling nature is one of the first facts which any\r\none attempting to tell the story of her life must bring before the reader's\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nThere was much reading aloud in the fireside circle at Minto, and for the\r\nboys much riding and sport. Many hours were spent upon the heather or in\r\nfishing the Teviot. Lady Fanny herself cared little for sport, or only for\r\nits picturesque side. Near the house are the rocks known as Minto Crags,\r\nmentioned by Sir Walter Scott in the \"Lay of the Last Minstrel,\" where many\r\nand many a time Lady Fanny raced about on hunting days, watching the\r\nredcoats with childish eagerness--intensely interested in the joyousness\r\nand beauty of the sight, but in her heart always secretly thankful if the\r\nfox escaped. Fox-hunting on Minto Crags must indeed have been a picturesque\r\nsight, and there was a special rock overhanging a precipice upon which she\r\nloved to sit and watch the wild chase, men and horses appearing and\r\ndisappearing with flashing rapidity among the woods and ravines beneath.\r\nThe pleasures of an open-air life meant so much to her that, in so far as\r\nit was possible for one with her temperament to pine at all, she was often\r\nhomesick in the town, longing for the peace and freedom of the country.\r\n\r\nThere were expeditions of other kinds too.\r\n\r\n    \"Gibby [1] and I,\" she writes towards the end of one October, \"up a\r\n    little after five this morning and up the big hill to see the sun\r\n    rise. It was moonlight when we went out, and all so still and\r\n    indistinct--for it was a cloudy moon--that our steps and voices\r\n    sounded quite odd. It was mild enough, but so wet with dew that our\r\n    feet grew very cold. We waited some time on the top before he rose\r\n    and had a long talk with the Kaims shepherd. It was well worth\r\n    having gone; though there was nothing fine in the sky or clouds\r\n    compared to what I have constantly seen at sunrise. But what I\r\n    thought beautiful was the entire change that his rising made in\r\n    everything. All we were looking at suddenly became so bright and\r\n    cheerful, and a hum of people and noises of animals were heard from\r\n    the village.\" \"I wish people,\" she adds impetuously, \"would shake\r\n    off sleep as soon as the blushing morn does peep in at their\r\n    windows.\"\r\n\r\n[1] Her brother Gilbert.\r\n\r\nThe entries in these early diaries show a quality of clear authentic\r\nvision, which was afterwards so characteristic of her conversation. For\r\nthose who remember their own youthful feelings, even the stiff occasional\r\nscraps of poetry she wrote at this time glow with a life not always\r\ndiscernible in the deft writing of more experienced verse-makers.\r\n\r\nThe household was a brisk, cheerful, active one, and ruled by the spirit of\r\norder necessary in a home where many different kinds of things are being\r\ndone each day by its different inmates. The children were treated with no\r\nparticular indulgence, and the elder ones were taught to be responsible not\r\nonly for their own actions, but for the good behaviour, and, in a certain\r\nmeasure, for the education of the younger ones. As a girl she writes down\r\nin her diary many hopes and fears about her younger brothers and sisters,\r\nwhich resemble those afterwards awakened in her by the care of her own\r\nchildren. A big family in a great house, with all the different relations\r\nand contacts such a life implies, is in itself an education, and Lady Fanny\r\nseems to have profited by all that such experiences can give. If she came\r\nfrom such a home anticipating from everybody more loyalty and consistency\r\nof feeling than is common in human nature, and crediting everybody with it,\r\nthat is in itself a kind of generous severity of expectation which, though\r\nit may be sometimes the cause of mistakes, helps also to create in others\r\nthe qualities it looks to find.\r\n\r\nThe children had plenty of outlets for their high spirits. There are some\r\nslight records left of the opening of a \"Theatre Royal, Minto,\" and of a\r\nglorious evening ending in an \"excellent country bumpkin,\" with bed at two\r\nin the morning; of reels and dances, too, and many hours laconically summed\r\nup as \"famous fun\" in the diary. Then there were such September days as\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n    \"Bob'm [2] and I went in the phaeton to meet the boys. They were\r\n    very successful--about twelve brace. The heather was in full blow,\r\n    and in wet parts the ground white with parnassia. I never felt such\r\n    an air--it made me feel quite wild. The sunset behind the far hills\r\n    and reflected in the lonely little shaw loch most beautiful. When\r\n    we began our walk there was a fine soft wind that felt as if it\r\n    would lift one up to the clouds, but before we got back to the\r\n    little house it had quite fallen, and all was as still as in a\r\n    desert, except now and then the wild cry of the grouse and\r\n    black-cock. Bob'm mad with spirits, and talked nonsense all the way\r\n    home. Not too dark to see the beautiful outline of the country all\r\n    the way.\"\r\n\r\n[2] Her sister Charlotte, afterwards Lady Charlotte Portal.\r\n\r\nSuch tired, happy home-comings stay in the memory; drives back at the end\r\nof long days, when scraps of talk and laughter and the pleasure of being\r\ntogether mingle so kindly with the solemnity of the darkening country;\r\ndrives which end in a sudden blaze of welcome, in fire-light and candles,\r\ntea and a hubbub of talk, when everything, though familiar, seems to\r\nconfess to a new happiness.\r\n\r\nHere is another entry a few days later:\r\n\r\n    \"Beautiful day, but a very high, warm _real Minto_ wind. We\r\n    wandered out very late and sat under the lime, playing at being at\r\n    sea, feeling the stem rock above us as we lent against it and\r\n    hearing the roaring of the waves in the trees. No summer's day can\r\n    be better than such a day and evening as this--there was a cloudy\r\n    moon, too, above the branches. I wish I could express, but I never\r\n    can, the sort of feeling I have at times--now more than I ever had\r\n    before--which would sound like affectation if one talked of it. A\r\n    fine day, or beautiful country, or very often nothing but the sky\r\n    or earth or the singing of a bird gives it. One feels too much love\r\n    and gratitude and admiration, and something swells my heart so that\r\n    I do not know how to look or listen enough.\"\r\n\r\nThere was another kind of romance, too, in her young life, destined in\r\nfuture to be at times a source of pain and anxiety, though also of keen\r\ngratification and permanent pride. What can equal the romance of politics\r\nwhen we are quite young, when \"politics\" mean nothing but \"serving one's\r\ncountry\" and have no other associations but that one, when politicians seem\r\nnecessarily great men? The love-dreams of adolescence have often been\r\ncelebrated; but among young creatures whose lives give plenty of play to\r\ntheir affections in a spontaneous way, such dreams seldom vie in intensity\r\nwith the mysterious call of religion or with the emotion of patriotism. It\r\nstands for an emotion which seems as large as the love of mankind, and its\r\nservice calls for enthusiasm and self-devotion. The Mintos were in the\r\nthick of politics and the times were stirring times. \"Throughout the last\r\ntwo centuries of our history,\" says Sir George Trevelyan in his Life of\r\nMacaulay, \"there never was a period when a man, conscious of power,\r\nimpatient of public wrongs, and still young enough to love a fight for its\r\nown sake, could have entered Parliament with a fairer prospect of leading a\r\nlife worth living and doing work that would requite the pains, than at the\r\ncommencement of the year 1830.\" Her father was not only the most genial and\r\nkindest of fathers, but he was to her something of a hero too. His\r\npolitical career had not begun during these days at Minto; still he was in\r\nthe counsel of the leaders of the day--Lord Grey, Lord John Russell, Lords\r\nMelbourne and Althorp--great names indeed to her. And the new Cabinet was\r\nsoon to appoint him Minister at Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe country was under the personal rule of the Duke of Wellington, who had\r\nsorted out from his Cabinet any who were tainted with sympathy for reform;\r\nbut, as the election of July which resulted in his resignation showed, the\r\ncountry, however one-sided its representation might have been in the House\r\nof Commons, had been long in a state of political ferment. This state of\r\naffairs, the gradual breaking up of the Tory party dating from the passing\r\nof the Catholic Emancipation Bill, the brewing social troubles, and the\r\nprospect of power crossing to the party which was determined on meeting\r\nthem with reform, made politics everywhere the most absorbing of themes.\r\n\r\nIn a country house like Minto, which was in close communication with the\r\nstatesmen of the time, discussions were of course frequent and keen. The\r\nguests were often important politicians; and long before Lady Fanny saw her\r\nfuture husband, she frequently heard his name as one whom those she admired\r\nlooked up to as a leader. In a girl by nature very susceptible to the\r\nappeal of great causes, whose active brain made her delight in the\r\narguments of her elders, these surroundings were likely to foster a\r\npassionate interest in public affairs; while other influences round her\r\nwere tending to increase in her a natural sense of the delicacy and\r\npreciousness of personal relations. In the course of telling her story\r\noccasions may come for remarking again on what was one of the chief graces\r\nof her character; but in a book of this kind the sooner the reader becomes\r\nacquainted with the subject of it, the more he is likely to see in what\r\nfollows. So let it be said of her at once that in all relations in which\r\naffection was complicated on one side by gratitude, or on her side by\r\nsuperiority in education or social position, she was perfect. She could be\r\nemployer and benefactress without letting such circumstances deflect in the\r\nslightest degree the stream of confidence and affection between her and\r\nanother. She had the faculty of removing a sense of obligation and of\r\nforgetting it herself. Such a faculty is only found in its perfection where\r\nthe mind is sensitive in perceiving the delicacy of the relations between\r\npeople; and it must be added that like most people who possess that\r\nsensitiveness, she missed it acutely in those who markedly did not.\r\n\r\nThe life at Minto, with its many contacts, was a life in which such a\r\nfaculty could grow to perfection. The daughters, while sharing much of the\r\nboys' lives at Minto, saw a great deal of the people upon the estate.\r\n\r\nThe intercourse between the family at the House and the people of Minto\r\nvillage was of an intimate and affectionate nature. Joys and sorrows were\r\nshared in unvarying friendliness and sympathy, and to the end of her life\r\n\"Lady Fanny\" remembered with warm affection the old village friends of her\r\nyouth. Kindly, true-hearted folk they were, with a sturdy and independent\r\nspirit which she valued and respected.\r\n\r\nShe only remembered seeing Sir Walter Scott on one occasion--when he came\r\nto visit her parents. She was quite a child, and it was the day on which\r\nher old nurse left Minto. She had wept bitterly, and when Sir Walter Scott\r\ncame she hardly dared even look at him with her tearful countenance. She\r\nalways remembered regretfully her indifference about the great man, whose\r\nvisit was ever after connected in her mind with one of the first sorrows of\r\nher childhood. She regretted still more that in those days political\r\ndifferences unhappily prevented the close and friendly intercourse which\r\nwould otherwise have undoubtedly existed between the Minto family and Sir\r\nWalter Scott.\r\n\r\nA word or two must be said upon the religion in which she was brought up,\r\nfor from her childhood she was deeply religious. Like her love for those\r\nnearest to her, it entered into everything that interested or delighted her\r\nprofoundly; into her interest in politics and social questions and into her\r\nenjoyment of nature.\r\n\r\nThe Mintos belonged to the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. The doctrines\r\nof this Church are not of significance here, but an indication of the\r\nattitude towards dogma, history, and conduct which harmonizes with these\r\ntenets is necessary to the understanding of her life. For this purpose it\r\nis only necessary to say that this Church belongs to that half of\r\nProtestantism which does not lay peculiar stress upon an inner conviction\r\nof salvation. It differs from the evangelical persuasions in this respect,\r\nand again from the Church of England in finding less significance in\r\necclesiastical symbols, in setting less store by traditional usages, and in\r\na more constant and uncompromising disapproval of any doctrine which\r\nregards the clergy as having spiritual functions or privileges different\r\nfrom those of other men. In the latter half of her life she came gradually\r\nto a Unitarian faith, which she held with earnestness to the last; and the\r\nname \"Free Church\" became more significant to her through the suggestion it\r\ncarried of a religion detached from creeds and articles. Many entries occur\r\nin her diaries protesting against what she felt as mischievous narrowness\r\nin the books she read and in the sermons she heard. She sympathized\r\nheartily with Lord John Russell's dislike of the Oxford movement. There are\r\nmany prayers in her diaries and many religious reflections in her letters,\r\nand in all two emotions predominate; a trust in God and an earnest\r\nconviction that a life of love--love to God and man--is the heart of\r\nreligion. Her religion was contemplative as well as practical; but it was a\r\nreligion of the conscience rather than one of mystical emotions.\r\n\r\nOf personal influences, her mother's, until marriage, was the strongest.\r\nThere are only two long breaks in the diary she kept, when she had no heart\r\nto write down her thoughts; one occurs during the year of Lady Minto's long\r\nand serious illness at Berlin, which began in 1832, and the other after\r\nLord John Russell's death in 1878.\r\n\r\nLady Minto was not strong; bringing many sons and daughters into the world\r\nhad tried her; and her delicacy seems to have drawn her children closer\r\nround her. Lady Fanny's references to her mother are full of an anxious,\r\nprotective devotion, as though she were always watching to see if any\r\nshadow of physical or mental trouble were threatening her. So in imagining\r\nthe merry, active life of this large family, the presence of a mother most\r\ntenderly loved, from whom praise seemed something almost too good to be\r\ntrue, must not be forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1830 (the year Lady Fanny's diaries begin), the Duke of\r\nWellington resigned, having emphatically declared that the system of\r\nrepresentation ought to possess, and _did_ possess, the entire\r\nconfidence of the country. He had gone so far as to say that the wit of man\r\ncould not have devised a better representative system than that which Lord\r\nJohn Russell, in the previous session, had attempted to alter by proposing\r\nto enfranchise Manchester, Leeds, and Birmingham. But the election which\r\nfollowed the death of George IV on June 26th had not borne out the Duke's\r\nassertion; it had gone heavily against him. Lord Grey, forming his Ministry\r\nout of the old Whigs and the followers of Canning and Grenville, at once\r\nmade Reform a Cabinet measure. During the stormy elections of July the news\r\ncame from Paris that Charles X had been deposed, and unlike the news of the\r\nFrench Revolution, it acted as a stimulus, not as a check, to the reforming\r\nparty in England.\r\n\r\nThe next entry quoted from Lady Fanny's diary, begun at the age of\r\nfourteen, is dated November 22, 1830; the family were travelling towards\r\nParis, matters having almost quieted down there. Louis Philippe had been\r\nrecognized by England as King of the French the month before, and the only\r\nside of the revolution which came under her young eyes was the somewhat\r\nvamped up enthusiasm for the Citizen King which followed his acceptance of\r\nthe crown and tricolor. It is said that any small boy in those days could\r\nexhibit the King to curious sightseers by raising a cheer outside the\r\nTuileries windows, when His Majesty, to whom any manifestation of\r\nenthusiasm was extremely precious, would appear automatically upon the\r\nbalcony and bow. But there were traces of agitation still to be felt up and\r\ndown the country, and over Paris hung that deceptive, stolid air of\r\nindifference which is so puzzling a characteristic of crises in France.\r\n\r\nThe Mintos travelled in several carriages with a considerable retinue, with\r\na doctor and servants, but not with a train which, in those days, would\r\nhave been thought remarkable for an English peer.\r\n\r\n    MELUN, _November_ 22, 1830 [3]\r\n\r\n    We left Sens at half past eight and did not stop to dine, but ate\r\n    in the carriage. We passed through Fossard, Monteran, and got here\r\n    about four. The doctor is quite grave about his tricolor and has\r\n    worn it all day. We have had immense laughing at him. He was very\r\n    much frightened at Sens, because Papa told him the people of the\r\n    hotel were for the Bourbons and were angry with him for wearing the\r\n    tricolor. A great many post-boys have it on their hats and all the\r\n    fleurs-de-lis on the mile-posts are rubbed out.\r\n\r\n[3] All extracts not otherwise specified are from Lady John Russell's\r\ndiary.\r\n\r\nBy this date Charles X, surrounded by his gloomy, ceremonial little court\r\nof faithful followers, was playing his nightly game of whist in the\r\nmelancholy shelter of Holyrood, where he was to remain for the next two\r\nyears, an insipid, sorrowful figure, distinguished by such dignity as\r\nunquerulous passivity can lend to the foolish and unfortunate. Meanwhile,\r\nParis was attempting to vamp up some interest in her new King, who walked\r\nthe streets with an umbrella under his arm.\r\n\r\n    PARIS, _December_ 23, 1830\r\n\r\n    We were in the Place Vendôme to-day, which was full of national\r\n    guards waiting for the King. We stopped to see him. It looked very\r\n    gay and pretty: the National Guard held hands in a long row and\r\n    danced for ever so long round and round the pillar, with the people\r\n    shouting as hard as they could. It looked very funny, but the King\r\n    did not come whilst we were there. We heard them singing the\r\n    Parisienne. The trial is over and the ministers are at Vincennes,\r\n    going to be put in prison. There have been several mobs about the\r\n    Luxembourg and the Palais Royal, but they think nothing more will\r\n    happen now.\r\n\r\nWho can hum now the tune of the \"Parisienne\"? It has not stayed in men's\r\nmemories like the \"Marseillaise\"; no doubt it expressed the prosaic,\r\nmiddle-class spirit of the National Guard, which kept a King upon the\r\nthrone, in his own way just as determined as his predecessors to rule in\r\nthe interests of his family.\r\n\r\n    PARIS, _February_ 5, 1831\r\n\r\n    Mama, Papa, Mary, Lizzy, [4] Charlie, Doddy [5] and I have been to\r\n    a children's ball at the Palais Royal. It was the most beautiful\r\n    thing I ever saw, and we danced all night long, but no big people\r\n    at all danced. We saw famously all the royal people; and Lizzy\r\n    danced with two of the little princes. The Duke of Orleans and M.\r\n    Duc de Nemours were in uniform and so were all the other gentlemen.\r\n    The King and Queen are nice-looking old bodies. [6] It was capital fun\r\n    and very merry indeed, the supper was beautiful. There was famous\r\n    galloping.\r\n\r\n[4] Her sisters Mary and Elizabeth, afterwards Lady Mary Abercromby and\r\nLady Elizabeth Romilly.\r\n\r\n[5] Her brothers Charles and George.\r\n\r\n[6] The next time she was to see the \"old bodies\" was on her own lawn at\r\nPembroke Lodge, where she heard from the King the unimpressive story of \"ma\r\nchute.\"\r\n\r\n    PARIS, _February_ 15, 1831\r\n\r\n    This is _Mardi gras_, the last day of the Carnival. We were\r\n    out in the carriage this morning to see the masks on the\r\n    boulevards; there were a great many masks and crowds of people,\r\n    whilst there were mobs and rows going on in another part of the\r\n    town. The people have quite destroyed the poor Archbishop's house,\r\n    because on Sunday night the Duc de Bordeaux's bust was brought, and\r\n    Mass was said for the Duc de Berry. They have taken all his books,\r\n    furniture, and everything, and they wanted to throw some priests in\r\n    the Seine, and they are breaking the things in the churches and\r\n    taking down the crosses. All the National Guard is out.\r\n\r\nThese disturbances were the last struggles of the party who had not been\r\nsatisfied by the spectacle of the son of Philippe Egalité, with the\r\ntricolor flag in one hand, embracing the ancient Lafayette on the balcony\r\nabove the Place de Grève. Their animosity against the Church was the\r\nground-swell of the storm which had washed away Charles X himself. The\r\nSacrilege Law introduced in 1825 had revived the barbarous mediaeval\r\npenalty of amputating the hand of the offender. Charles's attempt to\r\nreintroduce primogeniture by declaring the French principle of the equal\r\ndivision of property to be inconsistent with the principle of monarchy had\r\nirritated the people less than the encouragement he had given to monastic\r\ncorporations which were contrary to law. The controversy which followed\r\nbetween the ecclesiastics and their opponents was the cause of the repeal\r\nof the freedom of the Press; and when he had stifled controversy his next\r\nstep was the suspension of Parliament. Whence followed the events which so\r\nabruptly disturbed his evening rubber at St. Cloud on July 25th.\r\n\r\nThese outbreaks of the republican anti-clerical party to which Lady Fanny\r\nrefers were soon calmed; a few weeks later the soldiers had no more work to\r\ndo, and a grand review was held in the Champ de Mars.\r\n\r\n    PARIS, _March_ 27, 1831\r\n\r\n    We all went in the carriage to the heights of the Trocadéro and\r\n    there got out. It was very pretty to look down at the Champ de\r\n    Mars, which was quite full of soldiers, who sometimes ranged\r\n    themselves in lines and sometimes in nice little bundles and\r\n    squares. In front of the Ecole Militaire was a fine tent for the\r\n    Queen and Princesses. The King and the Duc de Nemours rode about,\r\n    and there were some loud cries of \"Vive le Roi.\" Less than a year\r\n    ago in the same place we saw old Charles X reviewing his soldiers\r\n    and heard \"Vive le Roi\" shouted for him and saw white flags waving\r\n    about the Champs de Mars instead of tricolor. It seems so odd that\r\n    it should all be changed in so short a time, and spoils the \"Vive\r\n    le Roi\" very much, because it makes one think they do not care\r\n    really for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PARIS, _April_ 2, 1831\r\n\r\n    We had a long walk with Mama to the places where the people that\r\n    were killed in July were buried. There are tricolor flags over them\r\n    all, and the flowers and crowns of everlastings were all nicely\r\n    arranged about the tombs. Amongst them was the kennel of a poor dog\r\n    whose master was one of the killed, which has come every day since\r\n    and lain on his grave. The dog itself was not in. The poor Swiss\r\n    are buried there, too, but without flowers or crowns or railings,\r\n    or even stones, to show the place.\r\n\r\nShe had been \"wishing horridly for fields and trees and grass\" for some\r\ntime past; on June 16, 1831, they were all back again in England.\r\n\r\n    DOVER, _June_ 16, 1831\r\n\r\n    Everything seems odd here; pokers and leather harness, all the\r\n    women and girls with bonnets and long petticoats and shawls and\r\n    flounces and comfortable poky straw bonnets, and boys so nicely\r\n    dressed, and urns and small panes (no glasses and no clocks),\r\n    trays, good bread, and everybody with clean and fresh and pretty\r\n    faces. We have been walking this evening by the sea, and all the\r\n    English look very odd; they all look hangy and loose, so different\r\n    from the Paris ladies, laced so tight they can hardly walk, and the\r\n    men and boys look ten times better.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ROCHESTER, _June_ 17, 1831\r\n\r\n    We did not leave Dover till near twelve--the country has really\r\n    been beautiful to-day; all the beautiful gentlemen's places with\r\n    large trees, and the pretty hedges all along the road full of\r\n    honeysuckle and roses; clean cows and white fat sheep feeding in\r\n    most beautiful rich green grass; the nicest little cottages with\r\n    lattice windows and thatched roofs and neat gardens, and roses,\r\n    ivy, and honeysuckle creeping to the tops of the chimneys;\r\n    everybody and everything clean and tidy.... The cart-horses are\r\n    beautiful, and even the beggars look as if they washed their faces.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _October_ 9, 1831, BOGNOR\r\n\r\n    We heard this morning of the loss of the Reform Bill, and we were\r\n    at first all very sorry, but in a little while rather glad because\r\n    it gives us a chance of Minto. When the people of Bognor heard it\r\n    was lost, they took the flowers and ribands off that they had\r\n    dressed up the coaches with, thinking it had passed, and put them\r\n    in mourning.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell had introduced the first Reform Bill on March 1, 1831;\r\nthis was carried by a majority of one; but in a later division the\r\nGovernment was defeated by a majority of eight, and Parliament was\r\ndissolved. The elections resulted in an emphatic verdict in favour of\r\nReform, and on June 24th Lord John introduced the second Reform Bill, which\r\nwas carried by a large majority in the House of Commons. He had proposed to\r\ndisfranchise partially or completely 110 boroughs; a proposition which had\r\nseemed so revolutionary that it was at first received with laughter by the\r\nOpposition, who were confident no such measure could ever pass. Lord Minto\r\nhad returned from France to support this Bill in the Lords, which on his\r\narrival he found had been rejected by them in a division on the 8th of\r\nOctober. The rejection of the Bill was followed by disturbances throughout\r\nthe country. Several members of the House of Lords were mobbed, Nottingham\r\nCastle was burnt down, and there was fighting and bloodshed in the streets\r\nof Bristol. Before the third Reform Bill was brought forward and carried by\r\na huge majority in the Commons, the whole Minto family were on their way\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nLady Fanny announces the fact of her arrival at her beloved home with many\r\necstatic exclamation marks.\r\n\r\n    _November_ 2, 1831, MINTO !!!!\r\n\r\n    Between Longtown and Langham we passed the toll that divides\r\n    England and Scotland. Harry and the coachman waved their hats and\r\n    all heads were poked out at window.\r\n\r\n    The moment we got into Scotland it felt much finer, the sun shone\r\n    brighter and the country really became far prettier. We went along\r\n    above the Esk, which is a little rattling, rumbling, clear, rocky\r\n    river, prettier than any we ever saw in England....\r\n\r\n    As we drove into Langham we were much surprised by a loud cheer\r\n    from some men and boys at the roadside, who all threw off their\r\n    caps as we passed. While we were changing, a man offered to Papa\r\n    that they would drag him through the town; Papa thanked him very\r\n    much but said he would rather not; so the man said perhaps he would\r\n    prefer three cheers, which they gave as we drove off.... The whole\r\n    town crowded round the carriages. Just as we were setting off,\r\n    however, we were very much surprised to see numbers of people take\r\n    the pole of the little carriage and run off with Papa and Mama with\r\n    all their might. They spun all through the town at a fine rate, and\r\n    did not stop for ever so long. There was immense cheering as we\r\n    drove off, and the people ran after us ever so far.... The house\r\n    all looked beautiful, and this evening we feel as if we had never\r\n    left Minto.\r\n\r\nBut she was not to stay there long, for early in 1832 they went to\r\nRoehampton House, near London, and the same year Lord Minto was appointed\r\nMinister at Berlin.\r\n\r\nAt this time Berlin was not a capital of sufficient dignity to entitle it\r\nto an embassy; but considering the state of European politics, the\r\nappointment was one of some diplomatic importance.\r\n\r\nGermany was at the beginning of her task of consolidation. The revolution\r\nof July had not been without its effect on her. In the southern States the\r\ncause of representative government was not wholly powerless; but it had\r\nbeen weakened by the reaction after 1815. Since the government was no\r\nlonger an undisguised tyranny and since the people themselves were growing\r\nricher, a strong sentiment of personal loyalty to the sovereign began to\r\nspread among them. Constitutional changes were therefore indefinitely\r\npostponed. The great work of the next few years for Prussian statesmen was\r\nthe removal of commercial barriers between the various German States, and\r\nthe establishment of a _Zollverein_ between them. In this way the sway\r\nof Austria was weakened, and though political union as an aim was carefully\r\nkept in the background, the foundation for the subsequent consolidation of\r\nthe German Empire was securely laid. During the two central years of this\r\nprocess, 1832-4, Lord Minto was at Berlin. The manners of the time were far\r\nsimpler and the life at the court far more informal than they were soon to\r\nbecome. Law and custom still preserved some lingering barbarities: during\r\ntheir stay at Wittenberg they heard of a man being broken on the wheel.\r\n\r\nThey stopped at Brussels on the way. There is a characteristic entry in\r\nLady Fanny's diary describing a visit to the battle-field.\r\n\r\n    NAMUR, _September_ 6, 1832\r\n\r\n    We coach-people left Brussels much earlier than the others that we\r\n    might have time to walk about Waterloo....\r\n\r\n    They showed us the house where the Duke of Wellington slept the\r\n    night before and the night after the battle and wrote home his\r\n    dispatches; then after a long and fierce dispute between a man and\r\n    woman which was to guide us, the man took us to the Church, where\r\n    we saw the monuments of immense numbers of poor common soldiers and\r\n    officers--then to the place where four hundred are buried all\r\n    together and one sees their graves just raised above the rest of\r\n    the ground. Then we drove to the field of battle, and the man\r\n    showed us everything; it was very nice and very sad to hear all\r\n    about, but as I shall always remember it, I need say nothing about\r\n    it. We are quite in a rage about a great mound that the Dutch have\r\n    put up with a great yellow lion on the top, only because the Prince\r\n    of Orange was wounded there, quite altering the ground from what it\r\n    was at the time of the battle. The monument to Lord Anglesea's leg\r\n    too, which we did not of course go to see, makes one very angry, as\r\n    if he was the only one who was wounded there--and only wounded too\r\n    when such thousands of poor men were killed and have nothing at all\r\n    to mark the place where they are buried; and I think they are the\r\n    people one feels most for, for though they do all they can, after\r\n    they are dead one never hears any more about them.\r\n\r\nSoon after their arrival at Berlin, Lady Minto fell dangerously ill. From\r\nSeptember, 1832, there is a long gap in Lady Fanny's diary, for she had no\r\nheart to set anything down. This long stretch of anxiety coming when she\r\nwas sixteen years old, if it did not change her nature, brought to light\r\nnew qualities which were to mark her character henceforward. There is a\r\nlittle entry written down eight years afterwards on the birthday of her\r\nsister Charlotte which shows that she, as well as others, looked back on\r\nthis time as a turning-point in her life.\r\n\r\n    Bob'm sixteen to-day, just the age I began to be unhappy, because I\r\n    began to think. Heaven spare her from the doubts and fears that\r\n    tormented me.\r\n\r\nDuring the months of her mother's gradual recovery she seems each day to\r\nhave been happier than on the one before.\r\n\r\n    _June_ 6, 1833, POTSDAM\r\n\r\n    At a little before eleven this morning, Mary, Ginkie, Henry, [7]\r\n    Mr. Lettsom [8] and I set off from Berlin in a very curious rickety\r\n    machine of a carriage, to leave Mama for a whole day and night,\r\n    which feels very impossible, and is the best sign of her (health)\r\n    that one could have. We were very happy and we thought everything\r\n    looking very nice. We were sorry to see no friends as we left\r\n    Berlin, for we looked so beautiful in our jolting little conveyance\r\n    with four horses and a post-boy blowing the old tune on his horn.\r\n\r\n[7] Her brother, afterwards Sir Henry Elliot.\r\n\r\n[8] The tutor.\r\n\r\nTo escape the heat of Berlin they moved out to Freienwalde.\r\n\r\n    _June_ 14, 1833, FREIENWALDE\r\n\r\n    A beautiful morning, and at about 10 they all set off from Berlin,\r\n    leaving Mama, Papa, Bob'm and I to follow after in the coach. After\r\n    they went, there were two long hours of going backwards and\r\n    forwards through the empty rooms, then having said a sad good-bye\r\n    to Senden,[9] Hymen,[9] Mr. Lettsom and Fitz, though we know we\r\n    shall see them again soon, we got into the coach with the squirrel\r\n    in a bag and drove off. I could not help feeling very sorry to\r\n    leave it all, though it will be so very nice to be out of it, but I\r\n    knew we should never be all there again as we have been, and all\r\n    the misery we have had in that house makes one feel still more all\r\n    the happiness of the last month there.\r\n\r\n    There is nothing to say of the country, for it is the same as on\r\n    all the other sides of Berlin; the soil more horrid than anything I\r\n    ever saw, and of course all as flat as water, but just now and then\r\n    some rather nice villages.... After about two hours there we came\r\n    on, first through nice, small Scotch fir woods, then quite ugly\r\n    again till near here, when we got into really pretty banks of oak,\r\n    beech, and fir, down a real steep road and along a nice narrow lane\r\n    till we got here, where they were all standing on the steps of our\r\n    mansion ready to receive us. Mama was carried to the drawing-room\r\n    ... before the house is a wee sort of border all full of weeds, but\r\n    nothing like a garden or place belonging to the house, but there\r\n    seem very few people; then there is a terrace, which is very nice\r\n    though it is public. Mama is not the least tired and quite pleased\r\n    with it all. It is very, very nice to be here, able to go out\r\n    without our things and expecting no company, and what at first one\r\n    feels more nice than everything, not having any carriages or noises\r\n    out of doors; for eight months and a half we have never been\r\n    without that horrid, constant rumbling in the streets. It is\r\n    _very_ odd to feel ourselves here; unlike any place I ever\r\n    lived in. The bath house is close by, but that is the only house\r\n    near us.\r\n\r\n[9] German friends at Berlin.\r\n\r\nThere they lived all the summer the life that they liked best. They lost\r\nthemselves in the forest, they read aloud, and they enjoyed the rustic\r\ntheatre. The autumn brought visits to Teplitz and Dresden.\r\n\r\nThey were back in Berlin for the winter and early spring, when she began to\r\ntake more part in society.\r\n\r\n    April 1, 1834, BERLIN\r\n\r\n    Stupid dinner of old gentlemen. Mary still being rather silly[10] did\r\n    not dine at table.... It was very awful to be alone, but at dinner\r\n    I was happy enough as Löven sat on one side of me. Humboldt was on\r\n    the other. Afterwards came Fitz for a moment and Deken and\r\n    Bismarck.\r\n\r\n\r\n    April 5, 1834, BERLIN\r\n\r\n    I sat the second quadrille by my stupidity in refusing Bismarck.\r\n\r\n[10] Scotch for unwell.\r\n\r\nEarly in May came \"the hateful morning of good-byes\" to friends in Berlin,\r\nand at Marienbad. Lord Minto heard the news that Lord Grey had resigned\r\nowing to Lord Althorp's refusal to agree to the Irish Coercion Bill. Lord\r\nMelbourne succeeded him as Prime Minister. Lord Minto had not long returned\r\nto England when the King summarily dismissed Lord Melbourne and a\r\nprovisional Government under the Duke of Wellington was patched together\r\nuntil Sir Robert Peel should return from abroad. The governorship of Canada\r\nhad been offered meanwhile to Lord Minto, and the family started on their\r\nhome journey fearing they would have to leave England immediately for\r\nQuebec. But this did not happen, and December found them at last once more\r\non the road to Minto. The girls wrote poems celebrating their return on the\r\njourney, and tried every cure for impatience as the carriage rolled along.\r\n\r\n    MINTO, Thursday, December 25, 1834\r\n\r\n    We left Carlisle about eight, and for the three first stages were\r\n    so slowly driven that our patience was nearly gone. To make it last\r\n    a little longer Mary read some \"Hamlet\" aloud between Longtown and\r\n    Langholme, and I had a nap.... As soon as we entered Hawick we were\r\n    surrounded by an immense crowd.... The bells rang, there were flags\r\n    hung all along the street, and fine shouting as we set off. Papa,\r\n    which we did not know at the time, had to make a little speech, and\r\n    contradict a shameful report of his having taken office. A few\r\n    minutes on this side of Hawick we met the two boys and Robert\r\n    riding to meet us, looking lovely. Our own country looked really\r\n    beautiful; rocks, hills, and Rubers Law all seemed to have grown\r\n    higher. We passed the awful ford in safety across our own lovely\r\n    Teviot, and soon found ourselves at Nelly's Lodge, where old Nelly\r\n    opened the gate to us.... The trees looked large and fine--in\r\n    short, everything perfect. Catherine, Mrs. Fraser, and Wales\r\n    received us at the door, and in a few minutes we were scattered all\r\n    over the house. We spent a most happy evening.... This has really\r\n    been a happy Christmas. It is wonderful to be here.\r\n\r\nAt this point Lady Fanny's early girlhood may be said to end. Her life in\r\nLondon society and the events which led to her marriage will be told in the\r\nnext chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n1835-41\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Minto family were still on their way home from Germany a\r\nstartling incident occurred in English politics. One morning a paragraph\r\nappeared in the Times announcing the fact that the King had dismissed Lord\r\nMelbourne.\r\n\r\nWe have no authority (it ran) for the important statement which follows,\r\nbut we have every reason to believe that it is perfectly true. We give it\r\nwithout any comment or amplification, in the very words of the\r\ncommunication, which reached us at a late hour last night. \"The King has\r\ntaken the opportunity of Lord Spencer's death to turn out the Ministry, and\r\nthere is every reason to believe the Duke of Wellington has been sent for.\r\nThe Queen has done it all.\"\r\n\r\n(The authority upon which the _Times_ was relying was that of the Lord\r\nChancellor.)\r\n\r\nSo on coming down to breakfast that morning the Ministers, having received\r\nno private communication whatever, read to their amazement that they had\r\nbeen already dismissed. Brougham had surreptitiously conveyed the\r\ninformation in order to embarrass the Court. The general trend of political\r\ngossip at the time was expressed by Palmerston, who wrote:\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to doubt that this has been a preconcerted measure and\r\nthat the Duke of Wellington is prepared at once to form a Government. Peel\r\nis abroad; but it is not likely he would have gone away without a previous\r\nunderstanding one way or the other with the Duke, as to what he would do if\r\na crisis were to arise.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact there had been no concerted plan. It was the first and\r\nlast independent step William IV ever took, and a most unconstitutional\r\ninstance of royal interference. The Duke, summoned by the King, expressed\r\nhis willingness to occupy any position His Majesty thought fit, but\r\nconsidering the Liberal majority in the House of Commons was two to one,\r\nand it was but two years since the Reform Bill passed, he did his best to\r\ndissuade the King from dismissing all his Ministers. During the interview\r\nthe King's secretary entered and called the attention of the King to the\r\nparagraph in the _Times_ that morning, which concluded with the\r\nstatement that the Queen had done it all. \"There, Duke, you see how I am\r\ninsulted and betrayed; nobody in London but Melbourne knew last night what\r\nhad taken place here, nor of my sending for you: will your Grace compel me\r\nto take back people who have treated me in this way?\"\r\n\r\nThereupon the Duke consented to undertake a provisional Government, while\r\nMr. Hudson was sent off to Italy in search of Sir Robert Peel. He reached\r\nRome in nine days; at that time very quick travelling. \"I think you might\r\nhave made the journey in a day less by taking another route,\" is said to\r\nhave been Peel's only comment upon receiving the Duke's letter. He returned\r\nat once to England to relieve the temporary Cabinet, and formed a Ministry\r\nin December. The same month Parliament was dissolved, and the Conservative\r\nparty went to the country on the policy of \"Moderate Reform\" enunciated in\r\nPeel's Tamworth manifesto. \"The shameful report\" referred to by Lady Fanny\r\nin the last chapter, and immediately contradicted by Lord Minto on his\r\nreturn to Scotland, was that he had joined the Peel Ministry.\r\n\r\nThus Lady Fanny came home to find the country-side preparing for a\r\nmid-winter election. Her uncle, George Elliot, was standing for the home\r\nconstituency against Lord John Scott, whom he just succeeded in defeating.\r\nIn most constituencies, however, the Liberals triumphed more easily, and\r\nwhen the new Parliament met they were in a majority of more than a hundred.\r\nIn April Lord John Russell carried his motion for the appropriation of the\r\nsurplus revenues of the Irish Church to general moral and religious\r\npurposes, so Peel resigned. Melbourne again became Prime Minister, and in\r\nthe autumn of the same year, 1835, Lord Minto was appointed First Lord of\r\nthe Admiralty.\r\n\r\nThis meant a great change in Lady Fanny's life; henceforward for the next\r\neight years more than half of every year was spent by her in London. There\r\nis a change, too, in the spirit of her diaries. Her nature was the reverse\r\nof introspective and melancholy, but at this time she was often unhappy and\r\ndissatisfied for no definite reason; her diaries show it. It is not likely\r\nthat others were aware of this private distress. She was leading at the\r\ntime a busy life both at home and in society, and there were many things in\r\nwhich she was keenly interested. The troubles confided to these private\r\npages were not due to compunction for anything she had done, nor were they\r\ncaused by any particular event; they expressed simply a general discontent\r\nwith herself and a kind of _Weltschmerz_ not uncommon in a young and\r\nthoughtful mind. For the first time she seems glad of outside interests\r\nbecause they distract her.\r\n\r\nThe months in London were broken by occasional residence at Roehampton\r\nHouse and by visits to Bowood. At Bowood with the Lansdowne family she was\r\nalways happy. There she heard with delight Tom Moore sing his Irish\r\nmelodies for the first time. There was much, too, in London to distract and\r\namuse her: breakfasts with Rogers, luncheons at Holland House, and\r\ndinner-parties at which all the leading Whig politicians were present. But\r\nsociety did not satisfy her; she wanted more natural and more intimate\r\nrelations than social gatherings usually afford.\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _May_ 9, 1835\r\n\r\n    We went to Miss Berry's in the evening. I thought it very tiresome,\r\n    but was glad to see Lord John Russell and his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BOWOOD, _December_ 26, 1835\r\n\r\n    The evening was very quiet, there was not much to alarm one, and\r\n    the prettiest music possible to listen to. Mr. Moore singing his\r\n    own melodies--it was really delightful, and a kind of singing I\r\n    never heard before. He has very little voice, but what he has is\r\n    perfectly sweet, and his real Irish face looks quite inspired. The\r\n    airs were most of them simply beautiful, and many of the words\r\n    equally so.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _January_ 31, 1836, ADMIRALTY\r\n\r\n    I am reading \"Ivanhoe\" for the first time, and delighted with it,\r\n    but things cannot be as they should be, when I feel that I require\r\n    to forget myself in order to be happy, and that unless I am taken\r\n    up with an interesting book there never, or scarcely ever, is a\r\n    moment of real peace and quiet for my poor weary mind. What is it I\r\n    wish for? O God, Thou alone canst clearly know--and in Thy hands\r\n    alone is the remedy. Oh let this longing cease! Turn it, O Father,\r\n    to a worthy object! Unworthy it must now be, for were it after\r\n    virtue, pure holy virtue, could I not still it? Dispel the mist\r\n    that dims my eyes, that I may first plainly read the secrets of my\r\n    wretched heart, and then give me, O Almighty God, the sincere will\r\n    to root out all therein that beareth not good fruit....\r\n\r\n\r\n    _February_ 4, 1836, ADMIRALTY\r\n\r\n    The great day of the opening of Parliament. Soon after breakfast we\r\n    prepared to go to the House of Lords--that is to say, we made\r\n    ourselves great figures with feathers and finery. The day has been,\r\n    unfortunately, rainy and cold, and made our dress look still more\r\n    absurd. The King did not come till two, so that we had plenty of\r\n    time to see all the old lords assembling. Their robes looked very\r\n    handsome, and I think His Majesty was the least dignified-looking\r\n    person in the house. I cannot describe exactly all that went on.\r\n    There was nothing impressive, but it was very amusing. The poor old\r\n    man could not see to read his speech, and after he had stammered\r\n    half through it Lord Melbourne was obliged to hold a candle to him,\r\n    and he read it over again. Lord Melbourne looked very like a Prime\r\n    Minister, but the more I see him and so many good and clever men\r\n    obliged to do, at least in part, the bidding of anyone who happens\r\n    to be born to Royalty, the more I wish that things were\r\n    otherwise--however, as long as it is only in forms that one sees\r\n    them give him the superiority one does not much mind. After the\r\n    debate, several of Papa's friends came to dine here. Lord\r\n    Melbourne, Lord Lansdowne, Lord Glenelg, and the Duke of Richmond,\r\n    who has won my heart--they talked very pleasantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _March_ 9, 1836, ADMIRALTY\r\n\r\n    I wonder what it is that makes one sometimes like and sometimes\r\n    dislike balls, etc. It does not always depend on whom one meets. I\r\n    am sure it is not, as most books and people seem to think, from\r\n    love of admiration that one is fond of them or else how should I\r\n    ever be so, when it is so impossible for anybody ever to admire my\r\n    looks or think me agreeable? I sometimes wish I was pretty. And I\r\n    do not think it is a very foolish wish: it would give me courage to\r\n    be agreeable.\r\n\r\nAll through this year there are many troubled entries:\r\n\r\n    _March_ 28, 1836, ADMIRALTY\r\n\r\n    Youth may and ought to have--yes, I see by others that it\r\n    has--pleasures which surpass those of unthinking though lovely\r\n    childhood: but have I experienced them? ... What makes the same sun\r\n    seem one day to make all nature bright, and the next only to show\r\n    more plainly the dreariness of the landscape? Oh wicked, sinful\r\n    must be those feelings that make me miserable--selfish and\r\n    sinful--and I cannot reason them away, for I do not understand\r\n    them. Prayer has helped me before now, and I trust it will still do\r\n    so. O Lord, forsake me not--take me into Thy own keeping.... Mama\r\n    fifty to-day [March 30, 1836]. Oh the feelings that crowd into my\r\n    heart as if they must burst it when I look to this day three years\r\n    ago. I cannot write or think clearly of it yet. I can only\r\n    feel--but what, I do not myself know--at one moment agony, doubts,\r\n    and fears, as if it was still that fearful day; then joy almost too\r\n    great to bear. When I think of her as she now is, then everything\r\n    vanishes in one overpowering feeling of intense thankfulness. I\r\n    have several times to-day seen her eyes fill with tears--every\r\n    birthday of those one loves gives one a melancholy feeling, and the\r\n    more rejoicings there are the stronger that feeling is.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _June_ 27, 1836, ADMIRALTY\r\n\r\n    It was decided that we should go to the Duchess of Buccleuch's\r\n    breakfast. My horror of breakfasts is only increased by having been\r\n    to this one, though I believe it was particularly pleasant.\r\n    Certainly the day was perfect, and the sight and the music pretty;\r\n    but I scarcely ever disliked people more or felt more beaten down\r\n    by shyness. My only thoughts from the moment we went in were: How I\r\n    wish it was over, and how I wish nobody would speak to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _September_ 6, 1836, ROEHAMPTON\r\n\r\n    Mama and I went to dine at Holland House.... The rooms are just\r\n    what one would expect from the outside of the handsome old house,\r\n    with a number of good pictures in the library, where we sat, all\r\n    portraits. Lord Holland is perfectly agreeable, and not at all a\r\n    man to be afraid of, in the common way of speaking, but for that\r\n    very reason I always am afraid of him--much more than of her, who\r\n    does not seem to me agreeable. I was very sorry Lord Melbourne did\r\n    not come, as he would have made the conversation more general and\r\n    agreeable.\r\n\r\nThe impression she made on others in her girlhood will be seen by this\r\npassage in the \"Reminiscences of an Idler,\" by Chevalier Wyhoff: \"I had the\r\nhonour of dancing a quadrille with Lady Fanny Elliot, the charming daughter\r\nof the Earl of Minto. Her engaging manners and sweetness of disposition\r\nwere even more winning than her admitted beauty.\"\r\n\r\nIn July it was decided that her brother Henry should go out to Australia\r\nwith Sir John Franklin. The idea of parting troubled her extremely, and,\r\nmoreover, the project dashed all the castles in the air she had built for\r\nhim. August 21st was the day fixed for his sailing. The 20th came--\"dismal,\r\ndismal day, making things look as if they understood it was his last.\" Long\r\nafterwards, whenever she saw the front of Roehampton House, where she said\r\ngood-bye to him, the scene would come back to her mind--the waiting\r\ncarriage and the last farewells. The autumn winds had a new significance to\r\nher now her brother was on the sea. She was troubled too about religious\r\nproblems, but she found it difficult, almost impossible, to talk about the\r\nthoughts which were occupying her. Writing of her cousin Gilbert Elliot,\r\nafterwards Dean of Bristol, for whom she felt both affection and respect,\r\nshe says: \"In the evening Cousin Gilbert talked a great deal, and not only\r\nusefully but delightfully, about different religious sects and against the\r\nmost illiberal Church to which he belongs--but how could I be happy? The\r\nmore he talked of what I wished to hear, the more idiotically shy I felt\r\nand the more impossible it became to me to ask one of the many questions or\r\nmake one of the many remarks (foolish very likely, but what would that have\r\nsignified?) which were filling my mind.\"\r\n\r\n    _December_ 24, 1836, BOWOOD\r\n\r\n    Mr. Moore sang a great deal, and one song quite overcame Lady\r\n    Lansdowne. At dinner I sat between Henry [11] and Miss Fazakerlie,\r\n    who told me that last year she thought me impenetrable. How sad it\r\n    is to appear to every one different from what one is.\r\n\r\n    I like both her and Henry better than ever, but oh, I dislike\r\n    myself more than ever--and so does everybody else--almost. Is it\r\n    vain to wish it otherwise?--no, surely it is not. If my manner is\r\n    so bad must there not be some real fault in me that makes it so,\r\n    and ought I not to pray that it may be corrected?\r\n\r\n[11] Afterwards Lord Lansdowne and the father of the present Marquis.\r\n\r\nShe read a great deal at this time; Jeremy Taylor, Milton, and Wesley,\r\nHeber, Isaac Walton, Burnet; Burns was her favourite on her happiest days.\r\nShe thought that work among the poor of London might help her; but her time\r\nwas so taken up both with looking after the younger children and by society\r\nthat she seems to have got no further than wondering how to set about it.\r\n\r\nOn June 20th, 1837, William IV died, and in July Parliament was dissolved.\r\nOn the 4th they were back again at Minto.\r\n\r\nHer uncle John Elliot was successful in his candidature of Hawick.\r\n\"Hawick,\" she writes, \"has done her duty well indeed--in all ways; for the\r\nsheriff's terrible riots have been nothing at all. Some men ducked and the\r\nclothes of some torn off. We all felt so confused with joy that we did not\r\nknow what to do all the evening.\" These rejoicings ended suddenly: Lady\r\nMinto was called to the death-bed of her mother, Mrs. Brydone.\r\n\r\n    _August_ 19, 1837, MINTO\r\n\r\n    I feel this time as I always do after a great misfortune, that the\r\n    shock at first is nothing to the quiet grief afterwards, when one\r\n    really begins to understand what has happened.\r\n\r\n    I cannot help constantly repeating over and over to myself that she\r\n    is gone, and sometimes I do not know how to bear it and however to\r\n    be comforted for not having seen her once more.\r\n\r\nWhen the new Queen's Parliament met after the General Election the strength\r\nof the Conservatives was 315 and of the Liberals 342. The Melbourne\r\nMinistry was in a weaker position; they could only hold a majority through\r\nthe support of the Radical and Irish groups, and troubles were brewing in\r\nthe country. On the other hand, Peel's position was not an easy one; the\r\nsplit among the Conservatives on Catholic Emancipation had left bitterness\r\nbehind, and in addition to this complication, his followers in the Commons\r\nincluded both men like Stanley, who had voted for Parliamentary reform, and\r\nits implacable opponents. But in spite of this flaw in the solidarity of\r\nthe Opposition, the Ministers were far from secure. There were the troubles\r\nin Canada, which Lord Durham had been sent out to deal with (the Canadian\r\npatriots had a great deal of Lady Fanny's sympathy), and in England the\r\ngrievances of the poor were in the process of being formulated into the\r\nfamous People's Charter. During the parliamentary sessions the Mintos\r\nremained in London, with only occasional very short absences.\r\n\r\n    ADMIRALTY, _December_ 26, 1837\r\n\r\n    People all seem pleased with the news from Canada because we are\r\n    beating the poor patriots--let people say what they will I must\r\n    wish them success and pity them with all my heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n    EASTBOURNE, _April_ 14, 1838\r\n\r\n    It is not only the out of doors pleasures, the sea, the air, etc.,\r\n    that we find here, but the way of living takes a weight from one's\r\n    mind, of which one does not know the burden till one leaves London\r\n    and is freed from it. \"I love not man the less\" from feeling as I\r\n    do the great faults, to us at least, of our London society. It is\r\n    because I love man, because I daily see people whose thoughts I\r\n    long to share and profit by, that I am so disappointed in being\r\n    unable to do so. Oh, why, why do people not all live in the\r\n    country--or if towns must be, why must they bring stiffness and\r\n    coldness on everybody?\r\n\r\n\r\n    ADMIRALTY, _May_ 10, 1838\r\n\r\n    Court Ball.... Beautiful ball of beautiful people dancing to\r\n    beautiful music. Queen dancing a great deal, looking very happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ADMIRALTY, _June_ 22, 1838\r\n\r\n    Evening at a Concert at the Palace--all the good singers.... All\r\n    the foreigners there, Soult and the Duke of Wellington shaking\r\n    hands more heartily than any other two people there.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ADMIRALTY, _June_ 28, 1838\r\n\r\n    Day ever memorable in the annals of Great Britain! Day of the\r\n    coronation of Queen Victoria! ... We were up at six, and Lizzy,\r\n    Bob'm, and I, being the Abbey party, dressed in all our grandeur.\r\n    The ceremony was much what I expected, but less solemn and\r\n    impressive from the mixture of religion with worldly vanities and\r\n    distinctions. The sight was far more brilliant and beautiful than I\r\n    had supposed it would be. Walked home in our fine gowns through the\r\n    crowd; found the stand here well filled, and were quite in time to\r\n    see the procession pass back. Nothing could be more beautiful, the\r\n    streets either way being lined with the common people, as close as\r\n    they could stand, and the windows, house-tops, balconies, and\r\n    stands crowded with the better dressed. Great cheering when Soult's\r\n    carriage passed, but really magnificent for the Duchess of Kent and\r\n    the Queen. The carriages splendid. Did not feel in the Abbey one\r\n    quarter of what I felt on the stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MINTO, _November_ 4, 1838\r\n\r\n    This morning brought us the sad, sad news of the death of Lady John\r\n    Russell. God give strength to her poor unhappy husband, and watch\r\n    over his dear little motherless children.\r\n\r\nThe only event of importance which occurred in the family during 1838 was\r\nthe marriage of the eldest daughter, Mary, to Ralph Abercromby, son of the\r\nSpeaker and afterwards Lord Dunfermline. It was a very happy marriage, but\r\nLady Fanny missed her sister very much, and her accounts of the wedding and\r\nthe last days before it are mixed with regrets. She speaks of it as \"an\r\nawful day,\" though it seems to have ended merrily enough in dancing and\r\nrejoicings.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1839, the Government resigned in consequence of the opposition to\r\nthe Jamaica Bill. The object of the Bill was to suspend the constitution of\r\nJamaica for five years, since difficulties had been made by the Jamaica\r\nAssembly in connection with the emancipation of slaves. The Radicals voted\r\nwith the Conservatives against the Government and the Bill was lost.\r\n\r\n    ADMIRALTY, _May_ 7, 1839\r\n\r\n    We are all out!!!!\r\n\r\n    Papa was summoned to a Cabinet at twelve this morning. Mama and I\r\n    in the meantime drove to some shops, and when we came home found\r\n    him anxiously expecting us with this overpowering news. We bore,\r\n    and are still bearing it with tolerable fortitude; but we are all\r\n    very, very sorry, and every moment find something new to regret.\r\n    Mama, notwithstanding all she has said, is not better pleased than\r\n    the rest of us. Papa looks very grave, or else tries to joke it\r\n    off.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FRIDAY, _May_ 10, 1839, ADMIRALTY\r\n\r\n    Agitating morning--one report following another every hour. Sir\r\n    Robert Peel refused to form a Ministry unless the Queen would part\r\n    with some of her household. To this she would not consent. To-day\r\n    she sent for Lord Melbourne.... We went to the first Queen's ball,\r\n    very anxious to see how she and other people looked, and to try to\r\n    foresee coming events by the expression of faces.... I spoke to\r\n    scarcely one Tory, but our Whig friends were in excellent\r\n    spirits--the Queen also seemed to be so.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TUESDAY, _May_ 14, 1839, ADMIRALTY\r\n\r\n    Papa and Bill [12] came from the House of Lords quite delighted\r\n    with Lord Melbourne's speech in explanation of what has\r\n    passed--manner, matter, everything perfect.\r\n\r\n[12] Her brother, Lord Melgund, afterwards third Earl of Minto.\r\n\r\nThus, within the week, the Whig Ministry had resigned and accepted office\r\nagain: this is what had happened.\r\n\r\nOn his return from Italy to take office Sir Robert Peel requested the Queen\r\nto change the ladies of her household, and on her refusal to do so, the\r\nMelbourne Ministry had come in again. Their return to power has been\r\ngenerally considered a blunder, from the party point of view; but their\r\naction in this case was not the result of tactical calculations. The young\r\nQueen was strange as yet to the throne, and she could not bear to be\r\ndeprived of her personal friends. When Peel made a change in her household\r\nthe condition of accepting office, she turned to the Whigs, who felt they\r\ncould not desert her. \"My dear Melbourne,\" wrote Lord John, \"I have seen\r\nSpencer, who says that we could not have done otherwise than we have done\r\nas gentlemen, but that bur difficulties with the Radicals are not\r\ndiminished....\"\r\n\r\nThey were, indeed, hard put to it to carry on the Government at all, and\r\nthey only succeeded in passing their Education Bill by a majority of two.\r\n\r\nOn August 12th the Mintos were still kept in London. \"Oh for the boys and\r\nguns and dogs, a heathery moor, and a blue Scotch heaven above me!\" she\r\nwrites. When they did get away home, they remained there until the\r\nbeginning of the new year. At home she seems to have been much happier. She\r\ntaught her young brothers and sisters, she visited her village friends, and\r\nrambled and read a great deal. In short, it was Minto!--all she found so\r\nhard to part from when marriage took her away.\r\n\r\nMany of the extracts from the diaries quoted in this chapter must be read\r\nin the light of the reader's own recollections of the process of getting\r\nused to life. They show that if Lady Russell afterwards attained a happy\r\nconfidence in action, she was not in youth without experience of\r\nbewilderment and doubts about herself. Following one another quickly, these\r\nextracts may seem to imply that she was gloomy and self-centred during\r\nthese years; but that was never the impression she made on others. Like\r\nmany at her age, when she wrote in a diary she dwelt most on the feelings\r\nabout which she found it hardest to talk. Her diary was not so much the\r\nmirror of the days as they passed as the repository of her unspoken\r\nconfidences. \"Looked over my journals, with reflections,\" she writes later;\r\n\"inclined to burn them all. It seems I have only written [on days] when I\r\nwas not happy, which is very wrong--as if I had forgotten to be grateful\r\nfor happy ones.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Drummond, Lord John Russell's stepdaughter (who was then Miss Adelaide\r\nLister), has recorded, in a letter to Lady Agatha Russell, her\r\nrecollections of the Minto family at that time.\r\n\r\n    I think (she writes) my first visit to the Admiralty, where I was\r\n    invited to children's parties, must have been in the winter before\r\n    my mother's death. I have no distinct first impressions of the\r\n    grown-up part of the family, except perhaps of your grandmother,\r\n    Lady Minto. Although children exaggerate the age of their elders,\r\n    and seldom appreciate beauty except that of people near their own\r\n    age, I did realize her great good looks. She had very regular\r\n    features and a beautiful skin, with a soft rose-colour in her\r\n    cheeks. Her hair was brown, worn in loops standing out a little\r\n    from the face, and she always wore a cap or headdress of some kind.\r\n    Her manner was most kind and winning, and she had a pleasant voice.\r\n    I am sure she must have been very even-tempered; and as I recall\r\n    her image now, and the peace and serenity expressed in her\r\n    beautiful face, I think she must have had a happy life. I never saw\r\n    her otherwise than perfectly kind and gentle and quite unruffled by\r\n    the little contretemps, which must have befallen her as they do\r\n    others. With this gentleness there was something that made one feel\r\n    she was capable and reliable, that there was a latent strength on\r\n    which those she loved could lean and be at rest. But in speaking of\r\n    these things I am going far beyond the impressions of the small\r\n    child skipping about the large rooms of the Admiralty.\r\n\r\n    There came a time when I not only went to parties and theatricals\r\n    at the Admiralty, but went in the afternoons to play with the\r\n    children. One great game was the ghost game. To the delightful\r\n    shudders produced by this was added some fear of the butler's\r\n    interference, for it took place on the large dining-room table. The\r\n    company was divided into two parties--the ghosts and the owners of\r\n    the haunted house. At four o'clock in the afternoon (so as to give\r\n    plenty of time to pile up the horror) the inmates of the house got\r\n    into bed--that is, on to the table. The ghosts then walked solemnly\r\n    round and round, while at intervals one of them imitated the\r\n    striking of the clock; as the hours advanced the ghosts became more\r\n    demonstrative and the company in bed more terror-stricken, and as\r\n    the clock struck twelve the ghosts jumped on to the table! Then\r\n    ensued a frightful scrimmage with ear-splitting squeals, and the\r\n    game ended. I imagine it was this climax which used to bring the\r\n    butler. We also had the game of giant all over the house. The yells\r\n    in this case sometimes brought Lady Minto on the scene, who was\r\n    always most good-natured. We were quieter when we got into\r\n    mischief; as when we made a raid on Lord Minto's dressing-room, and\r\n    each ate two or three of his compressed luncheon tablets and also\r\n    helped ourselves to some of his pills. This last exploit _did_\r\n    rather disturb Lady Minto; but, as it happens, neither luncheons\r\n    nor pills took any effect on the raiders.\r\n\r\n    There were often delightful theatricals at the Admiralty. The best\r\n    of the plays was a little operetta written by your mother, called\r\n    \"William and Susan,\" in which Lotty and Harriet[13] sang\r\n    delightfully in parts; but this must have been later on than the\r\n    game period.\r\n\r\n    I come now to my first distinct impression of your mother. It is as\r\n    clear as a miniature in my mind's eye, and it belongs to a very\r\n    interesting time. I think her engagement to Papa [14] must just\r\n    have been declared. She came with Lord and Lady Minto to dine with\r\n    him at 30, Wilton Crescent, the house he owned since his marriage\r\n    to my mother. As she passed out of the room to go down to dinner,\r\n    \"Lady Fanny's\" face and figure were suddenly photographed on my\r\n    brain. Her dark and beautiful smooth hair was most becomingly\r\n    dressed in two broad plaited loops, hanging low on the back of the\r\n    neck; the front hair in bands according to the prevailing fashion.\r\n    Her eyes were dark and very lustrous. Her face was freckled, but\r\n    this was not disfiguring, as a rich colour in her cheeks showed\r\n    itself through them. Her neck, shoulders, and arms were most\r\n    beautifully white, and her slim upright figure showed to great\r\n    advantage in the neat and simple dress then worn. Hers was of blue\r\n    and silver gauze, the bodice prettily trimmed with folds of the\r\n    stuff, and the sleeves short and rather full. I think she wore an\r\n    enamelled necklet of green and gold. Mama [15] long afterwards told\r\n    me that at this dinner she went through a very embarrassing moment;\r\n    Papa asked her what wine she would have, and she, just saying the\r\n    first thing that came into her head, replied, \"Oh, champagne.\"\r\n    There was none. Papa was sadly disconcerted, and replied humbly,\r\n    \"Will hock do?\" I used to take much interest at all times in Papa's\r\n    dinner-parties, and sometimes suggested what I considered suitable\r\n    guests. I was much disappointed when I found my selection of Madame\r\n    Vestris and O'Connell did not altogether commend itself to Papa.\r\n\r\n[13] Lady Harriet Elliot, sister of Lady John Russell.\r\n\r\n[14] Lord John Russell.\r\n\r\n[15] The second Lady John Russell.\r\n\r\nMrs. Drummond, in another letter to Lady Agatha Russell, alluding to a\r\nvisit to Minto before Lord John Russell's second marriage, writes:\r\n\r\n    Mama [then Lady Fanny Elliot] was very kind to me even then, and I\r\n    took to her very much. I used to admire her bright eyes and her\r\n    beautiful and very abundant dark hair, which was always exceedingly\r\n    glossy, and her lovely throat, which was the whitest possible--also\r\n    her sprightly ways, for she was very lively and engaging.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1840 was spent between the Admiralty and Putney House, which\r\nthe Mintos had taken. Lady Fanny's description of Putney sounds to us now\r\nimprobably idyllic:\r\n\r\n    Out almost till bedtime--the river at night so lovely, so calm,\r\n    still, undisturbed by anything except now and then a slow,\r\n    sleepy-looking barge, gliding so smoothly along as hardly to make a\r\n    ripple. The last few nights we have had a little crescent moon to\r\n    add to the beauty. Then the air is so delightfully perfumed with\r\n    azalea, hawthorn, and lilac, and the nightingales sing so\r\n    beautifully on the opposite banks, that it is difficult to come in\r\n    at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PUTNEY HOUSE, _April 30, 1840_\r\n\r\n    Finished my beloved \"Sir Samuel Romilly.\" It is a book that\r\n    everybody, especially men, should immediately read and meditate\r\n    upon.\r\n\r\nIt was during the summer of this year, 1840, that she began to see more of\r\nLord John Russell. She had met him a good many times at \"rather solemn\r\ndinner-parties,\" and he had stayed at Minto. She had known him well enough\r\nto feel distress and the greatest sympathy for him when his wife died,\r\nleaving him with two young families to look after--six children in all,\r\nvarying in age from the eldest Lister girl, who was fourteen, to Victoria,\r\nhis own little daughter, whose birth in 1838 was followed in little more\r\nthan a week by the death of her mother. Lord John was nearly forty-eight.\r\nHitherto he had been a political hero in her eyes rather than a friend of\r\nher own; but, as the following entries in her diary show, she began now to\r\nrealize him from another side.\r\n\r\n    _June 3, 1840,_ PUTNEY HOUSE\r\n\r\n    Lord John Russell and Miss Lister [16] came to spend the afternoon\r\n    and dine. All the little Listers came. All very merry. Lord John\r\n    played with us and the children at trap-ball, shooting, etc.\r\n\r\n[16] Miss Harriet Lister was the sister of Lord John's first wife.\r\n\r\nThe next time they met was at the Admiralty: \"Little unexpected Cabinet\r\nmeeting after dinner. Lords John Russell and Palmerston, who talked _War\r\nwith France_ till bedtime. I hope papa tells the truth as to its\r\nimprobability.\" Two days later she writes: \"Lord John Russell again\r\nsurprised us by coming in to tea. How much I like him.\" The next evening\r\nshe dined at his house: \"Sat between Lord John and Mr. E. Villiers. Utterly\r\nand for ever disgraced myself. Lord John begged me to drink a glass of\r\nwine, and I asked for champagne when there was none!\"\r\n\r\nOn August 13th they left London for Minto:\r\n\r\n    We had two places to spare in the carriage, which were taken by\r\n    Lord John Russell and little Tom [his stepson, Lord Ribblesdale].\r\n    We had wished it might be so, though I had some fears of his being\r\n    tired of us, and of our being stupefied with shyness. This went off\r\n    more than I expected, and our day's journey was very pleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MINTO, _August_ 14, 1840\r\n\r\n    Actually here on the second day! From Hawick we had the most lovely\r\n    moonlight, making the river like silver and the fields like snow.\r\n    Oh Scotland, bonny, bonny Scotland, dearest and loveliest of lands!\r\n    if ever I love thee less than I do now, may I be punished by living\r\n    far from thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MINTO, _August_ 30, 1840\r\n\r\n    A great party to Church. Many eyes turned on Lord John as we walked\r\n    from it. He was much amused by the remark of one man: \"Lord John's\r\n    a silly [17] looking man, but he's smart, too!\"--which he, of\r\n    course, would have understood as an Englishman. In the evening he\r\n    gave me a poem he had composed on the subject of my letter from\r\n    Lancaster to Mrs. Law [18] announcing ourselves for the next\r\n    day.... In the morning [September 1] Lord John begged to sit in our\r\n    sitting-room with us.... I told him the library would be more\r\n    comfortable, and we were established there (he very kindly reading\r\n    the \"Lay\" aloud), when two Hawick Bailiffs arrived to present him\r\n    with the freedom of the town.... After dinner, Miss Lister asked me\r\n    so many questions chiefly relating to marrying, that I began to\r\n    believe that Lord John's great kindness to us all, but especially\r\n    to me, meant something more than I wished. I lay awake, wondering,\r\n    feeling sure, and doubting again.\r\n\r\n[17] Delicate.\r\n\r\n[18] Housekeeper.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MINTO, _September_ 2, 1840\r\n\r\n    Lord John, Miss Lister, Addy and I went to Melrose Abbey and\r\n    Abbotsford.... It was his last evening, and in wishing me good-bye\r\n    he said quite enough to make me tell Mama all I thought.... I could\r\n    see that she was very glad I did not like him in that way. I am\r\n    sure I do in every other.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MINTO, _September_ 3, 1840\r\n\r\n    Lord John set off before seven this morning. I dreamed about him\r\n    and waked about him all night.... Mama gave me a note from Lord\r\n    John to me which he had left.... I wrote my answer immediately,\r\n    begging him not to come back; but also telling him how grateful I\r\n    feel. Had a long talk and walk with Miss Lister, whose _great_\r\n    kindness makes it all more painful to me.\r\n\r\nLady Fanny wrote to her sister, Lady Mary Abercromby:\r\n\r\n    A proposal from Lord John Russell is at this moment lying before\r\n    me. I see it lying, and I write to you that it is there, but yet I\r\n    do not believe it, nor shall I ever.... Good, kind Miss Lister\r\n    positively worships him.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MINTO, _September_ 4, 1840\r\n\r\n    Went to the village with Mama and my darling Addy [Lord John's\r\n    stepdaughter], to whom I may show how I love her now that he is\r\n    away.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MINTO, _September_ 7, 1840\r\n\r\n    Received a very, very sad note from Lord John in answer to mine--so\r\n    kind, but oh! so sad.\r\n\r\nThe note ran as follows:\r\n\r\n    _September_ 5, 1840\r\n\r\n    DEAR LADY FANNY,--You are quite right. I deceived myself, not from\r\n    any fault of yours, but from a deep sense of unhappiness, and a\r\n    foolish notion that you might throw yourself away on a person of\r\n    broken spirits, and worn out by time and trouble. There is nothing\r\n    left to me but constant and laborious attention to public business,\r\n    and a wretched sense of misery, which even the children can never\r\n    long drive away. However, that is my duty, and my portion, and I\r\n    have no right to murmur at what no doubt is ordained for some good\r\n    end. So do not blame yourself, and leave me to hope that my life\r\n    may not be long.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly, J. RUSSELL\r\n\r\nMiss Lister wrote to Lord John on September 9, 1840:\r\n\r\n    Sad as your letters are, it is still a relief to have them. I\r\n    _will_ hope for you though you cannot for yourself.... I\r\n    cannot thank you as I wish and feel for all you are with regard to\r\n    the children, for all you have been to them. I never can think of\r\n    it without tears of gratitude.... You have been more than even an\r\n    own father could have been. And by your example--an example of all\r\n    that is good and pure and great in mind and conduct--you are doing\r\n    for them more than any other teaching can do.\r\n\r\nFor a few days Lady Fanny seems to have felt that the matter was\r\nirrevocably settled: \"The more I think of what has happened, the more I\r\nbewilder myself--I therefore do not think at all.\"\r\n\r\nBut on the following day she writes: \"Though I do not think, I dream. I\r\ndreamt of him last night on some of Catherine's bride cake, and that Miss\r\nLister wrote to me of him as one whose equal could not be found in the\r\nwhole world.\"\r\n\r\nOf one thing she was certain, she did not want to leave her home: \"The west\r\nhills looking beautiful as we walked round the church. What a pleasure it\r\nis to have a church in such a situation! One worships God the better from\r\nseeing His beauty so displayed around.... Walked in the glen and wandered\r\nabout the burn and top of Mama's glen, wondering how anybody could ever ask\r\nme to leave all that is so much too dear.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday [October 23] received a letter from Miss Lister. Tells me a\r\ngreat deal about him--the way in which he first named me since, and his\r\nkeeping the book, and much more that is very, very touching; but I will not\r\nsentimentalize even to my journal, for fear of losing my firmness again.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, gossip was busy coupling her name with Lord John's, and the\r\nPress published the rumour.\r\n\r\n    _Lady Minto to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    MINTO, _November_ 9, 1840\r\n\r\n    ... You will see in the papers the report of Fanny's marriage to\r\n    Lord John Russell. It is very annoying to her, and I had a few\r\n    lines (very touching) from him begging me to have it contradicted,\r\n    which I had already done. If you ask me my reasons why, I cannot\r\n    tell you, but I have a sort of feeling that she will marry him\r\n    still. Gina says certainly not, and neither Lizzy nor I think her\r\n    opinions or feelings changed, but I feel it _in my skin_!!!\r\n    Still, these feelings are not infallible.... Will you tell me if\r\n    I wish it or not? For I have now thought so much about it I don't\r\n    know my own mind. If I knew that she would not marry _at all_,\r\n    if she did not marry _him_, then I should most miserably\r\n    lament that she refused him; but I also know as certainly, that if\r\n    she told me that upon second thoughts she had accepted him, I\r\n    should be too unhappy to be able to look as I ought to do. In\r\n    short, dearest Mary, I heartily wish it had never happened. I was\r\n    obliged to tell John [Elliot] of it, as the report was going to be\r\n    made a subject of joking, which would have been very unpleasant for\r\n    Fanny. He was very much surprised, and notwithstanding his great\r\n    dislike to disparity of years, he regretted her refusal deeply. He\r\n    is a great admirer of Lord John's, and was delighted with him when\r\n    he was here. He says that in spite of the drawbacks he is clearly\r\n    of the opinion that she has made a great mistake, and hopes that it\r\n    may take another turn still. You may fancy how I am longing to talk\r\n    to your Father about it. He says in his last letter that his eyes\r\n    were only just opened to Lord John's being an old man, when he\r\n    looked on him in this new light....\r\n\r\n\r\n    MINTO, _November_ 15, 1840\r\n\r\n    My birthday--it frightens me to be twenty-five. To think how days,\r\n    months, and years have slipped away and how unfulfilled resolutions\r\n    remain to reproach me. Long walk with Papa--talked to me about Lord\r\n    John very kindly. Had a long letter from Miss Lister--tells me a\r\n    good deal about him, and the more I hear the more I am forced to\r\n    admire and like. Then why am I so ungrateful? Oh! why so obstinate?\r\n    I can only hope for the sake of my character that Dryden is right\r\n    that \"Love is not in our choice but in our fate.\"\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the new year the family moved up to London. The next\r\nentry, dated from the Admiralty, expressive in its brevity, runs: \"A\r\nsurprising number of visitors, one very alarming, no less than Lord\r\nJohn--and I saw him.\" Then, a week later, on February 8: \"The agitation of\r\nlast Monday over again.... After all, perhaps he only wished to show that\r\nhe is friendly still. It is like his kindness, but he did not look merry.\"\r\n\r\nIn March she wrote to her married sister, Lady Mary Abercromby, an account\r\nof her feelings and perplexities.\r\n\r\n    ADMIRALTY, _March_ 16, 1841\r\n\r\n    DEAREST MARY,--Tho' it is not nearly my day for writing, a long\r\n    letter from you to Mama, principally about myself, has determined\r\n    me to do so--and to do so this minute, while I feel that I have\r\n    courage for the great effort (yes, you may laugh, but it is a\r\n    terrible effort) of saying to you all that you have the best right\r\n    to abuse me for not having said before. If it was really\r\n    _saying_, oh how happy I should be! but there is something so\r\n    terribly distinct in one's thoughts as soon as they are on paper,\r\n    and I have longed each day a thousand times to have you by my side\r\n    to help me to read them and to listen to all my nonsense. I felt it\r\n    utterly impossible to write them, altho' I also felt that my\r\n    silence was most unfair upon you and would have made me, in your\r\n    place, either very suspicious or very angry. It _has_ made you\r\n    suspicious, but now let it only make you angry--as angry as you\r\n    please--for I have _not_ changed and I do not suppose I ever\r\n    shall. When we first came to town, nothing having taken place\r\n    between us since my positive refusal from Minto, except the\r\n    contradiction sent by us to the report in the papers, Miss Lister\r\n    asked me if I was the same as ever; and when I said yes, and\r\n    forbade her the subject for the future, she only begged that I\r\n    would see him and allow myself to know him better. I said I would\r\n    do so, provided she was quite sure he was ready to blame himself\r\n    alone for the consequences, which she said he would. Accordingly,\r\n    wherever we met I allowed him to speak to me. I begged Lizzy always\r\n    to join in our talk, if she could, as it made me much happier, but\r\n    this she has not done nearly as much as I wished. Whenever I knew\r\n    we were to meet him, I also took care to tell Lizzy that it would\r\n    be no pleasure to me, and that if it was at dinner, I hoped I\r\n    should not sit next to him. I said these things to her oftener than\r\n    I should naturally have done, because I saw that in her wish to\r\n    disbelieve them she really did so, and I wished to make her\r\n    understand me, in case either Papa or Mama or the boys should be\r\n    speaking of it before her. You will say, why did I not speak more\r\n    to Mama herself?--partly because I was afraid of bringing forward\r\n    the subject, partly because I knew what I had to say would make her\r\n    sorry, and partly because I was not at times so _very_ sure as\r\n    to have courage to say it must all come to an end. However, after a\r\n    dinner at Lady Holland's last week, when he was all the evening by\r\n    me, I felt I _must_ speak--that it would be very wrong to\r\n    allow it to go on in the same way, and that we had no right to\r\n    expect the world to see how all advances to intimacy, since we came\r\n    to town, have been made by him in the face of a refusal. I do not\r\n    despise the gossip of the world where there is so much foundation\r\n    for it, and I have felt it very disagreeable to know that busy eyes\r\n    were upon us several times. It must therefore stop, but do not\r\n    imagine that I have been acting without thought. I am perfectly\r\n    easy about _him_--I mean that he will blame nobody but\r\n    himself, as I have taken care never to understand anything that he\r\n    has said that he might mean to be particular, and the few times\r\n    that he ventured to approach the subject he spoke in so perfectly\r\n    hopeless and melancholy a way as to satisfy me. I am also easy\r\n    about Miss Lister, as only a week ago she said how sorry she was to\r\n    see that I was happier in society without than with him; but both\r\n    he and they must see that it cannot go on so. What a stone I\r\n    am--but it is needless to speak of that. Only when I think of all\r\n    his goodness and excellence, above all his goodness in fixing upon\r\n    me among so many better fitted to him, I first wonder and wonder\r\n    whether he really can be in earnest, then reproach myself bitterly\r\n    for my hardness--and then the children: to think of rejecting an\r\n    opportunity of being so useful--or at least of trying to be so! All\r\n    these thoughts, turned over and over in my mind oftener than I\r\n    myself knew before we left Minto, _did_ make me think that\r\n    perhaps I had decided rashly. Now do not repeat this, dear Mary; I\r\n    have said more to you than to anybody yet--but I am sorry it is\r\n    time to stop, I have so much more to say. I cannot say how grateful\r\n    I am to Papa and Mama for leaving me so free in all this, and to\r\n    you for writing.\r\n\r\n    Ever your most affectionate sister, FANNY\r\n\r\nThe day after this letter was written she saw Lord John again. \"He called\r\nand had a long conversation with Mama.... Mama liked him better than\r\never.\"\r\n\r\n    _Lady Minto to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    ADMIRALTY, _March_ 18, 1841\r\n\r\n    ... I must now return to _the_ subject. I told you of the\r\n    conversation I had with Fanny when she spoke so openly and so\r\n    sensibly of her feelings.... She said she was too old to think it\r\n    necessary to be what is called desperately in love, and without\r\n    feeling that his age was an objection or that the disparity was too\r\n    great, yet, she said, if he had been a younger man she would have\r\n    decided long ago. And that is the truth. It is his age alone that\r\n    prevents her at once deciding in his favour. It prevents those\r\n    feelings arising in her mind, without which it would be a struggle\r\n    to accept him, and this she never will do. She was therefore\r\n    desirous that he should know the state of her feelings, that she\r\n    might be again at her ease. He had seen her manner cold towards\r\n    him, and wrote to say that he would call upon me yesterday. I was\r\n    _horribly_ frightened, as I hate lovers, and you must allow\r\n    that it was a difficult task to go through.... However, he put me\r\n    so completely at my ease by his sensible, open, gentle manner, that\r\n    my task was less difficult than I expected--except that I fell in\r\n    love with him so desperately, he touched my heart so deeply that I\r\n    could scarcely refrain from promising him Fanny whenever he chose.\r\n    There is a depth of feeling and humility about him, and a candour\r\n    and generosity in his judgments, that I never saw so strongly in\r\n    anyone before, and every word that he spoke made me regret more and\r\n    more the barrier that prevents him from becoming one of us. I said,\r\n    of course, Fanny's wish and ours could only be for him to do what\r\n    he considered best for his own happiness, and that half-measures\r\n    did not answer; that he now knew the whole truth and it was for him\r\n    to judge how to act. He said then, \"I cannot have a doubt; I will\r\n    visit you less frequently; I will speak very little to you in\r\n    public, but I cannot, unless you positively forbid me, renounce the\r\n    intimacy now established with your family.\" I said, of course, that\r\n    it would be a great happiness to us all not to lose him, but that I\r\n    was very doubtful of the wisdom of his decision, as it might only\r\n    be rendering himself more unhappy. \"That,\" he said, \"is my affair,\r\n    and I am willing to run the risk.\" ... Fanny, to whom I told\r\n    everything, says she is now quite happy, and her mind at ease.\r\n\r\nHe seems, however, to have made up his mind to keep away from them for some\r\nweeks. The next mention of him is on May 7th, more than a month later:\r\n\r\n    Morning visit from Lord John. Said he had a great speech to make\r\n    this evening on sugar.... Billy came to dinner full of admiration\r\n    of the speech. Honest, noble, clever. Well, we shall go out with\r\n    honour.\r\n\r\nThis speech on sugar was made at a crisis of particular difficulty. The\r\ndebate was the first important discussion in Parliament on the new\r\nprinciple of Free Trade. Greville describes Lord John's speech as an\r\n\"extraordinarily good one,\" and Lord Sydenham [19] wrote from Canada:\r\n\r\n    I have read your speech upon opening the debate on the sugar\r\n    question with feelings of admiration and pleasure I cannot\r\n    describe. The Free Traders have never been orators since Mr. Pitt\r\n    in early days. We have hammered away with facts and figures and\r\n    some argument, but we could not elevate the subject and excite the\r\n    feelings of the people. At last you, who can do both, have fairly\r\n    undertaken it, and the cause has a champion worthy of it.\r\n\r\n[19] Lord Sydenham said later, \"Lord John is the noblest man it has ever\r\nbeen my fortune to follow\" (Spencer Walpole's \"Life of Lord John Russell\").\r\n\r\nMr. Baring, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, proposed to lower the import\r\nduty on foreign and colonial timber and sugar. Lord John, before the Budget\r\nspeech, announced his intention of moving the House into a committee on the\r\nCorn Laws. During the course of the eight days' debate he admitted that the\r\nproposal of the Ministry would be a fixed duty of 8s. a quarter on wheat.\r\nIt was on the occasion of this proposal being discussed in the Cabinet that\r\nMelbourne, at the close of the meeting, made his famous remark, \"By the by,\r\nthere is one thing we haven't agreed upon; what are we to say? Is it to\r\nmake our corn dearer or cheaper, or to make the price steady? I don't care\r\nwhich; but we had better all say the same thing.\"\r\n\r\nOn June 4th, the very evening Lord John had intended to introduce his\r\nmeasure, the Government was just defeated on Peel's motion of a want of\r\nconfidence: \"Bill woke me at four this morning with the sad words, 'Beaten\r\nby one! Oh dear, oh dear! To expect a triumph and see it won by the enemy.\r\nNever mind; our friends deserve success if they cannot command it.... Party\r\nat Lady Palmerston's. He was there.\"\r\n\r\nFour days later her hesitations came to an end, and they were engaged to be\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\nMiss Lister wrote to Lord John on June 8th from Windsor Castle:\r\n\r\n    Oh! I am happier than I can tell you. God knows you have deserved\r\n    all the good that may come to you, and I always felt it must be\r\n    because of that. I long to be with you and to see her. ... Oh! I am\r\n    so happy, but I can scarcely believe it yet. I hope Lady Fanny will\r\n    write and then I think I shall believe it.\r\n\r\n    Ever yours affectionately, Harriet Lister\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    June 9, 1841 Could not write on Monday or Tuesday. Saw him on\r\n    Monday morning ... it was a strange dream all that day and is so\r\n    still.... As soon as he had left me Mama came in. Oh my own\r\n    dearest and best Mama, bless your poor weak but happy child. Then I\r\n    saw Papa. What good it did me to see his face of real\r\n    happiness!--then my brothers and sisters--I never saw William so\r\n    overcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ADMIRALTY, _June_ 10, 1841\r\n\r\n    Tried to be busy in the morning ... but nothing would do. Must\r\n    think and be foolish. He came in the afternoon and evening--brought\r\n    me an emerald ring.... Miss Lister came--both of us stupid from\r\n    having too much to say, but it was a great pleasure. Children\r\n    here to tea with ours (all but Victoria) and very merry and kind\r\n    to me. Dear precious children.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Minto to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    ADMIRALTY, June 11, 1841\r\n\r\n    You must be longing so ardently for post-day that I hate to think\r\n    of the uncomfortable letter this is likely to be; but as Fanny is\r\n    writing to you herself, my letter will be of less consequence. Oh\r\n    the volumes and volumes I could write and long to write and the wee\r\n    miserable things that I do write! I must at once begin by saying\r\n    that Fanny's happy face would, more than all I can write, convince\r\n    you how perfectly satisfied and proud she is of the position she\r\n    has put herself in; how it delights her to think of the son-in-law\r\n    she has given to your Father, and the friend she has given your\r\n    brothers. To me he is everything that my proudest wishes could have\r\n    sought out for Fanny. You know as well as me that it was not an\r\n    ordinary person that could suit her; and it really is balm to my\r\n    heart to see the way in which he treasures every word she says, and\r\n    laughs at the innocence and simplicity of her remarks, and looks at\r\n    her with such pride when he sees her keen and eager about the great\r\n    and interesting events of the day, which most girls would neither\r\n    know nor care about. I don't mean that he is absurd in his\r\n    admiration of her, but it is evident how fully he appreciates the\r\n    singular beauty of her character. In short, to sum up all I can say\r\n    of him, he is in many respects a counterpart of herself. She is\r\n    very open and at her ease with him, and I am quite as much at my\r\n    ease with him as I was with Ralph....\r\n\r\n\r\n    _From Lady Mary Abercromby to Lord John Russell_\r\n\r\n    GENOA, _June_ 19, 1841\r\n\r\n    ... You will every day discover more the great worth of what you\r\n    have won. You cannot have known her long without admiring the\r\n    extreme truth and purity of her mind; it is sensitive to a degree\r\n    which those with more of worldly experience can scarcely\r\n    understand, yet I feel sure you will watch over it, for it has a\r\n    charm to those who can appreciate it which must make them dread to\r\n    see it disturbed. It is a great privation to me to be so little\r\n    acquainted with you, but believe me I cannot think of you as a\r\n    stranger now that you belong to my dearest Sister, and that I look\r\n    to you for her happiness. If you could think of me as a sister and\r\n    treat me as such it would be a delight to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ADMIRALTY, _June_ 18, 1841\r\n\r\n    Very happy day--every day now happier than the one before. Oh will\r\n    it--can it last? O God, enable me to thank Thee as I ought--to live\r\n    a life of gratitude to Thee.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n1841\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He served his country well in choosing thee.\" [20]\r\n\r\n[20] From a sonnet to Lady John Russell by Lord Wriothesley Russel, written\r\nafter reading Lady Minto's ballad in which these words occur: \"His country\r\nand thee.\"\r\n\r\nParliament had been dissolved soon after Peel's motion of a want of\r\nconfidence had been carried. In the election which followed Lord John was\r\nreturned for the City of London on June 30th.\r\n\r\n    ADMIRALTY, _June_ 26, 1841\r\n\r\n    Day of nomination in the City. He says the show of hands was\r\n    greatly in his favour.... Mama says he looked so calm, in the midst\r\n    of the uproar.\r\n\r\n    \"True dignity is his, _his_ tranquil mind Virtue has raised\r\n    above the things below!\"\r\n\r\n    And whether storms may await us in our journey together, even to\r\n    the wreck of all earthly hopes, I know that he will rise superior\r\n    to them--and oh! to think that I may be by his side to support him\r\n    in adversity as well as to share in his prosperity and glorious\r\n    fate, for which God enable me to be rightly grateful.\r\n\r\nThe family moved to Minto before the result was declared; from London Lord\r\nJohn wrote the following letters:\r\n\r\n    _Lord John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    WILTON CRESCENT, _June_ 25, 1841\r\n\r\n    Your letters have filled us all with joy and completed what was\r\n    wanting. I feel very grateful to you for the kindness with which\r\n    you express yourself.... The happiness of possessing her has\r\n    blinded me, I dare say, to her real interest; but when I find that\r\n    you all approve and feel conscious that I shall do all in my power\r\n    to make her life happy, I gain some confidence. Among many\r\n    anxieties, Lady Minto naturally felt that the charge of so many\r\n    children would be a very serious burthen to her, but the children\r\n    themselves are so good, so much disposed to love her, and their\r\n    health is at present so good, that I trust they will be to her as\r\n    they are to me, a daily comfort, making the house cheerful with\r\n    their merry and affectionate voices. The greatest fear perhaps is,\r\n    that her generosity and devotion to others may make her undertake\r\n    what is beyond her strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord John Russell to Lady Fanny Elliot_\r\n\r\n    DOWNING STREET, _July_ 3, 1841\r\n\r\n    If I am sorry that Saturday is come, I am much more glad that\r\n    Tuesday is so near. I am not at all anxious for a merry party at\r\n    Minto--the quieter the better for me. But I can understand that\r\n    Lady Minto would like some gaiety to divert her spirits, when \"Our\r\n    dear Fanny\" is gone. I cannot say how much I think on the prospect\r\n    of finding you at Minto--and of Bowhill likewise. I hope I am not\r\n    unworthy of the heart you gave me ... and I trust every day will\r\n    prove how grateful I am to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILTON CRESCENT, _July_ 4, 1841\r\n\r\n    I got your little note yesterday, after I had sealed my letter....\r\n    My dearest Fanny, I am so happy at the thought of being soon at\r\n    Minto. If you believe that I feel the strongest devotion to you,\r\n    and am resolved to do all in my power to make you happy, you\r\n    believe what is true.... This will reach you soon after your\r\n    arrival. I can imagine how busy you will be ... and long to join\r\n    you.\r\n\r\nA few days later he reached Minto himself. Lady Fanny, writing to her\r\nsister Mary, describes their days together, and adds: \"They are all except\r\nGibby so much too respectful to Lord John. Not to me, for they take their\r\nrevenge upon me, and I am unsparingly laughed at, which is a great comfort.\r\nI shall write once before it happens. I dare not think what I shall be when\r\nyou receive this.\"\r\n\r\n    MINTO, _July_ 19, 1841\r\n\r\n    My last day as a child of Minto. How fast it flew. How quickly\r\n    good-night came--that sad, that dreaded good-night. But sadness may\r\n    be of such a kind as to give rise to the happiest, the purest\r\n    feelings--and such was this.... He and I sat in the Moss house.\r\n    Never saw the glen more beautiful; the birch glittering in the sun\r\n    and waving its feathery boughs; the burn murmuring more gently than\r\n    usual; the wood-pigeons answering one another from tree to tree.\r\n    Had not courage to be much with Mama.\r\n\r\nThey were married on July 20th in the drawing-room at Minto, and set off\r\nfor Bowhill, which had been lent them for the honeymoon by the Duke of\r\nBuccleuch. Never did statesman on his wedding-day take away a bride more\r\nwhole-heartedly resolved to be all a wife can be to him in his career. Her\r\nmother was now perfectly happy about the marriage, though the disparity of\r\nage, and fears about the great responsibility her daughter was undertaking\r\nin the care of a young family--one boy and five girls--had undoubtedly made\r\nher anxious. Lady Minto felt very deeply the parting with her dearly-loved\r\nchild, and after the wedding she sent her the following little ballad:\r\n\r\n  A BORDER BALLAD\r\n\r\n  AIR: \"_Saw ye my father_\"\r\n\r\n  Oh saw ye the robber\r\n  That cam' o'er the border\r\n  To steal bonny Fanny away?\r\n  She's gane awa' frae me\r\n  And the bonny North Countrie\r\n  And has left me for ever and for aye.\r\n\r\n  He cam' na wi' horses,\r\n  He cam' na wi' men,\r\n  Like the bauld English knights langsyne;\r\n  But he thought that he could fleech\r\n  Wi' his bonny Southron speech\r\n  And wile awa' this lassie o' mine.\r\n\r\n  \"Gae hame, gae hame\r\n  To your ain countrie,\r\n  Nor come o'er the March for me.\"\r\n  But sairly did she rue\r\n  When he thought that she spak' true\r\n  And the tear-drop it blinded her e'e.\r\n\r\n  His heart it was sair\r\n  And he lo'ed her mair and mair,\r\n  For her spirit was noble and free;\r\n  \"Oh lassie dear, relent,\r\n  Nor let a heart be rent\r\n  That lives but for its country and thee.\"\r\n\r\n  And did she say him nay?\r\n  Oh no, he won the day,\r\n  Could an Elliot a Russell disdain?\r\n  And he's ta'en awa' his bride\r\n  Frae the bonnie Teviot-side,\r\n  And has left me sae eerie alane.\r\n\r\n  Oh where's now the smile\r\n  Used to cheer me ilk morn,\r\n  Like a blink o' the sun's ain light;\r\n  And where the voice sae sweet\r\n  That aye gar'd my bosom beat\r\n  When sae saftly she bade me gude-night.\r\n\r\n  Now lang, lang are the nights\r\n  And dowie are the days\r\n  That sae cheerie were ance for me.\r\n  And oh the thought is sair\r\n  That she'll mine be never mair,\r\n  I'm alane in the North Countrie.\r\n\r\n    MARY MINTO, _July_, 1841\r\n\r\nBut before following the future, it will be well to look back. Lord John\r\nhimself must play so large a part in a biography of his wife that a sketch\r\nof his life up to this point, and some reminders of the kind of man he was,\r\nmay interest the reader; not a review of his political achievements, but an\r\noutline of the events which had left him at his second marriage a leader\r\namong his countrymen.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell, born in 1792, was the third son of John, sixth Duke of\r\nBedford. He was only nine years old when he lost his mother, whom he\r\nremembered to the end of his life with tender affection. He always spoke\r\ngratefully of the invariable kindness and affection of his father, who\r\nmarried again in 1803, and of his stepmother, but he felt that the shyness\r\nand reserve which often caused him to be misunderstood and thought cold\r\nwere largely due to the loss of his mother in his childhood. He was\r\neducated at Westminster, but he was not robust enough to stand a rough\r\nlife, and it was decidedly rough. His education was continued at Woburn\r\nunder a tutor. He was a book-loving boy, and the earliest exercise of his\r\npowers was in verses, prologues, and plays. Going to the play was one of\r\nthe chief enjoyments of his childhood, and he never lost his liking for the\r\ndrama. Travelling was also a great delight to him, either by coach in\r\nEngland or in foreign countries, and this enjoyment, with a wonderfully\r\nkeen observation of all that he saw of different places and peoples, lasted\r\nto old age.\r\n\r\nIn 1835 Lord John married Lady Ribblesdale, widow of the second Lord\r\nRibblesdale.\r\n\r\nShe had by her first husband four children; one son and three daughters.\r\n[21] After her marriage with Lord John Russell she had two daughters,\r\nGeorgiana Adelaide, born in 1836, and Victoria, born in 1838. The marriage\r\nhad been a most happy one, and her death on November 1, 1838, was a severe\r\nblow to Lord John.\r\n\r\n[21] Lord Ribblesdale, Adelaide Lister (Mrs. Drummond), Isabel Lister (Mrs.\r\nWarburton), Elizabeth Lister (Lady Melvill).\r\n\r\nA slight sketch of the more public side of his career will be enough here.\r\nA visit to Fox in June, 1806, was perhaps the first experience which turned\r\nhis interests and ambitions towards politics. All his life he looked up to\r\nthe memory of Fox. There was in Fox an element which made him more akin to\r\nthe Liberals, who succeeded him, than to the old Whig party. Lord John, as\r\ndifferent from Fox in temperament as a man could be, was the inheritor of\r\nthe spirit which leavened the old Whig tradition. In Lord John the\r\nsentiments of Fox took on a more deliberate air. He was a more intellectual\r\nman than his lavish, emotional, imposing forbear; and if it is remembered\r\nthat he had, in addition, the diffidence of a sensitive man, these facts go\r\nfar to explain an apparent contradiction in his character which puzzled\r\ncontemporaries. To the observer at a distance there seemed to be two John\r\nRussells: the man who appeared to stand off coldly from his colleagues and\r\nbackers (he was certainly as incapable as the younger Pitt of throwing\r\nround him those heartening glances of good-fellowship which made the\r\nfollowers of Fox feel like a band of brothers); and again, the man who, to\r\nthe rapture of adherents, could lift debate at moments to a level where\r\npassionate principles swept all hesitation away. It was surprising to find,\r\nin one who commonly wore the air of picking his steps with care, the dash\r\nand anger of the fighter. Bulwer Lytton has described such moments in \"The\r\nNew Timon\"--\r\n\r\n   \"When the steam is on,\r\n  And languid Johnny glows to glorious John.\"\r\n\r\nHis speeches, if they had not the animated, flowing reasonableness of\r\nCobden's, resembled them in this, that they belonged to that class of\r\noratory which aims at convincing the reason rather than at persuading the\r\nemotions. Lord John had, however, one quality likely to make him widely\r\npopular--his pluck; at bay he was formidable. If there was a trace of\r\ninjustice or unreasonableness in his adversaries, though their case might\r\nbe overwhelmingly plausible, it was ten to one he routed them in confusion.\r\nHe was ready in retort. One example of this readiness Gladstone was fond of\r\nquoting: Sir Francis Burdett had made a speech against the Whigs, in which\r\nhe spoke of the \"cant of patriotism.\" \"There is one thing worse than the\r\ncant of patriotism,\" retorted Lord John, \"and that is the recant of\r\npatriotism.\" Again, when the Queen once asked him, \"Is it true, Lord John,\r\nthat you hold that a subject is justified, in certain circumstances, in\r\ndisobeying his sovereign?\" his answer to this difficult question could not\r\nhave been better: \"Well, speaking to a sovereign of the House of Hanover, I\r\ncan only say that I suppose he is.\"\r\n\r\nOne more characteristic must be mentioned. Like most men scrupulous and\r\nslow in determining what to do, his confidences often were withheld from\r\nothers till the last moment, and sometimes beyond the moment, when it would\r\nhave been wisest to admit his colleagues to his own counsel. In consequence\r\nhe often appeared disconcertingly abrupt in decision.\r\n\r\nIn 1808 he accompanied Lord and Lady Holland to Spain and Portugal, and on\r\nhis return he was sent by his father to Edinburgh University, the Duke\r\nhaving little confidence in the education then procurable at either Oxford\r\nor Cambridge. At Edinburgh he took part in the proceedings of the\r\nSpeculative Society, read essays to them and debated; and he left the\r\nUniversity still tending more towards literature than politics. There is no\r\ndoubt that Edinburgh helped to form him. His mind was one naturally open to\r\ninfluences which are summed up as \"the academic spirit\"; dislike of\r\nexaggeration, impatience with brilliancy which does not illuminate, and\r\ndistrust of enthusiasm which is not prepared to show its credentials at\r\nevery step. His own style is marked by these qualities, and in addition by\r\na reminiscence of eighteenth-century formality, more likely to please\r\nperhaps future than present readers; accurate, a little distant, it pleases\r\nbecause it conveys a sense of modesty and dignity. When he speaks of\r\nhimself he does it to perfection.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the University he served in the Bedford militia. In 1814 he\r\nwent to Italy, and crossed to Elba, where he saw Napoleon. Lord John was\r\nalways a most authentic reporter. His description of the Emperor, written\r\nthe next day, besides its intrinsic interest, is so characteristic of the\r\nwriter himself that it may be quoted here. It is as matter-of-fact as one\r\nof Wellington's dispatches and as shrewd as a passage from one of Horace\r\nWalpole's letters.\r\n\r\n    PORTO FERRAJO, December 25, 1814 [22]\r\n\r\n    At eight o'clock in the evening yesterday I went to the Palace\r\n    according to appointment to see Napoleon. After waiting some\r\n    minutes in the ante-room I was introduced by Count Drouet and found\r\n    him standing alone in a small room. He was drest in a green coat\r\n    with a hat in his hand very much as he is painted, but excepting\r\n    this resemblance of dress, I had a very mistaken idea of him from\r\n    his portrait. He appears very short, which is partly owing to his\r\n    being very fat, his hands and legs being quite swollen and\r\n    unwieldy; this makes him appear awkward and not unlike the whole\r\n    length figures of Gibbon, the historian. Besides this, instead of\r\n    the bold marked countenance that I expected, he has fat cheeks and\r\n    rather a turn-up nose, which, to bring in another historian, made\r\n    the shape of his face resemble the portraits of Hume. He has a\r\n    dusky grey eye, which would be called a vicious eye in a horse, and\r\n    the shape of his mouth expresses contempt and derision--his manner\r\n    is very good-natured, and seems studied to put one at one's ease by\r\n    its familiarity; his smile and laugh are very agreeable--he asks a\r\n    number of questions without object, and often repeats them, a habit\r\n    he has no doubt acquired during fifteen years of supreme\r\n    command--to this I should also attribute the ignorance he seems to\r\n    show at times of the most common facts. When anything that he likes\r\n    is said, he puts his head forward and listens with great pleasure,\r\n    repeating what is said, but when he does not like what he hears, he\r\n    looks away as if unconcerned and changes the Subject. From this one\r\n    might conclude that he was open to flattery and violent in his\r\n    temper.\r\n\r\n    He began asking me about my family, the allowance my father gave\r\n    me, if I ran into debt, drank, played, etc.\r\n\r\n    He asked me if I had been in Spain, and if I was not imprisoned by\r\n    the Inquisition. I told him that I had seen the abolition of the\r\n    Inquisition voted, and of the injudicious manner in which it was\r\n    done.\r\n\r\n    He mentioned Infantado, and said, \"II n'a point de caractere.\"\r\n    Ferdinand he said was in the hands of the priests--afterwards he\r\n    said, \"Italy is a fine country; Spain too is a fine\r\n    country--Andalusia and Seville particularly.\"\r\n\r\n    _F. R._ Yes, but uncultivated.\r\n\r\n    _N._ Agriculture is neglected because the land is in the hands\r\n    of the Church.\r\n\r\n    _F. R._ And of the Grandees.\r\n\r\n    _N._ Yes, who have privileges contrary to the public\r\n    prosperity.\r\n\r\n    _F. R._ Yet it would be difficult to remedy the evil.\r\n\r\n    _N._ It might be remedied by dividing property and abolishing\r\n    hurtful privileges, as was done in France.\r\n\r\n    _F. R._ Yes, but the people must be industrious--even if the\r\n    land was given to the people in Spain, they would not make use of\r\n    it.\r\n\r\n    _N._ Ils succomberaient.\r\n\r\n    _F. R._ Yes, Sire.\r\n\r\n    He asked many questions about the Cortes, and when I told him that\r\n    many of them made good speeches on abstract questions, but that\r\n    they failed when any practical debate on finance or war took place,\r\n    he said, \"Oui, faute de l'habitude de gouverner.\" He asked if I had\r\n    been at Cadiz at the time of the siege, and said the French failed\r\n    there.\r\n\r\n    _F. R._ Cadiz must be very strong.\r\n\r\n    _N._ It is not Cadiz that is strong, it is the Isle of\r\n    Leon--if we could have taken the Isle of Leon, we should have\r\n    bombarded Cadiz, and we did partly, as it was.\r\n\r\n    _F. R._ Yet the Isle of Leon had been fortified with great\r\n    care by General Graham.\r\n\r\n    _N._ Ha--it was he who fought a very brilliant action at\r\n    Barrosa.\r\n\r\n    He wondered our officers should go into the Spanish and Portuguese\r\n    service. I said our Government had sent them with a view of\r\n    instructing their armies; he said that did well with the\r\n    Portuguese, but the Spaniards would not submit to it. He was\r\n    anxious to know if we supported South America, \"for,\" he said, \"you\r\n    already are not well with the King of Spain.\"\r\n\r\n    Speaking of Lord Wellington, he said he had heard he was a large,\r\n    strong man, _grand chasseur_, and asked if he liked Paris. I\r\n    said I should think not, and mentioned Lord Wellington having said\r\n    that he should find himself much at a loss what to do in peace\r\n    time, and I thought scarcely liked anything but war.\r\n\r\n    _N._ La guerre est un grand jeu, une belle occupation.\r\n\r\n    He wondered the English should have sent him to Paris--\"On n'aime\r\n    pas l'homme par qui on a été battu. Je n'ai jamais envoyé a Vienne\r\n    un homme qui a assisté à la prise de Vienne.\" He asked who was our\r\n    Minister (Lord Burghersh) at Florence, and whether he was\r\n    _honnête homme_, \"for,\" he said, \"you have two kinds of men in\r\n    England, one of _intrigans_, the other of _hommes très\r\n    honnêtes_.\"\r\n\r\n    Some time afterwards he said, \"Dites moi franchement, votre\r\n    Ministre à Florence est il un homme à se fier?\"\r\n\r\n    He had seen something in the papers about sending him (Napoleon) to\r\n    St. Helena, and he probably expected Lord Burghersh to kidnap\r\n    him--he inquired also about his family and if it was one of\r\n    consequence.\r\n\r\n    His great anxiety at present seems to be on the subject of France.\r\n    He inquired if I had seen at Florence many Englishmen who came from\r\n    there, and when I mentioned Lord Holland, he asked if he thought\r\n    things went well with the Bourbons, and when I answered in the\r\n    negative he seemed delighted, and asked if Lord Holland thought\r\n    they would be able to stay there. I said I really could not give an\r\n    answer. He said he had heard that the King of France had taken no\r\n    notice of those Englishmen who had treated him well in\r\n    England--particularly Lord Buckingham; he said that was very wrong,\r\n    for it showed a want of gratitude. I told him I supposed the\r\n    Bourbons were afraid to be thought to depend upon the English.\r\n    \"No,\" he said, \"the English in general are very well received.\" He\r\n    asked sneeringly if the Army was much attached to the Bourbons.\r\n\r\n    Talking of the Congress, he said, \"There will be no war; the Powers\r\n    will disagree, but they will not go to war\"--he said the Austrians,\r\n    he heard, were already much disliked in Italy and even at Florence.\r\n\r\n    _F. R._ It is very odd, the Austrian government is hated\r\n    wherever it has been established.\r\n\r\n    _N._ It is because they do everything with the baton--the\r\n    Italians all hate to be given over to them.\r\n\r\n    _F. R._ But the Italians will never do anything for\r\n    themselves--they are not united.\r\n\r\n    _N._ True.\r\n\r\n    Besides this he talked about the robbers between Rome and Florence,\r\n    and when I said they had increased, he said, \"Oh! to be sure; I\r\n    always had them taken by the _gendarmerie_.\"\r\n\r\n    _F. R._ It is very odd that in England, where we execute so\r\n    many, we do not prevent crimes.\r\n\r\n    _N._ It is because you have not a _gendarmerie_.\r\n\r\n    He inquired very particularly about the forms of the Viceregal\r\n    Court in Ireland, the _Dames d'honneur_, pages, etc.; in some\r\n    things he was strangely ignorant, as, for instance, asking if my\r\n    father was a peer of Parliament.\r\n\r\n    He asked many questions three times over.\r\n\r\n    He spoke of the Regent's conduct to the Princess as very impolitic,\r\n    as it shocked the _bienséances_, by which his father had\r\n    become so popular.\r\n\r\n    He said our war with America was a _guerre de vengeance_, for\r\n    that the frontier could not possibly be of any importance.\r\n\r\n    He said, \"You English ought to be very well satisfied with the end\r\n    of the war.\"\r\n\r\n    _F. R._ Yes, but we were nearly ruined in the course of it.\r\n\r\n    _N._ Ha! le système continental, ha--and then he laughed very\r\n    much.\r\n\r\n    He asked who was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at present, but made no\r\n    remark on my answer.\r\n\r\n    I asked him if he understood English; he said that at Paris he had\r\n    had plenty of interpreters, but that he now began to read it a\r\n    little.\r\n\r\n    Many English went to Elba about this time; the substance of their\r\n    conversations is still in my recollection--April 2, 1815. He said\r\n    that he considered the great superiority of England to France lay\r\n    in her aristocracy, that the people were not better, but that the\r\n    Parliament was composed of all the men of property and all the men\r\n    of family in the country; this enabled the Government to resist the\r\n    shock which the failure of the Duke of York's expedition was liable\r\n    to cause--in France it would have destroyed the Government. (This\r\n    is an opinion rather tinged by the Revolution, but it is true that\r\n    our House of Commons looks to final results.) They were strong, he\r\n    said, by \"les souvenirs attachants à l'histoire\"; that on the\r\n    contrary he could make eighty senates in France as good as the\r\n    present; that he had intended to create a nobility by marrying his\r\n    generals, whom he accounted as quite insignificant, notwithstanding\r\n    the titles he had given them, to the offspring of the old nobility\r\n    of France. He had reserved a fund from the contribution which he\r\n    levied when he made treaties with Austria, Prussia, etc., in order\r\n    to found these new families. \"Did you get anything from Russia?\"\r\n\r\n    _N._ No, I never asked anything from her but to shut her ports\r\n    against England.\r\n\r\n    He wished, he said, to favour the re-establishment of the old\r\n    families, but every time he touched that chord an alarm was raised,\r\n    and the people trembled as a horse does when he is checked.\r\n\r\n    He told the story of the poisoning, and said there was some truth\r\n    in it--he had wished to give opium to two soldiers who had got the\r\n    plague and could not be carried away, rather than leave them to be\r\n    murdered by the Turks, but the physician would not consent. He said\r\n    that after talking the subject over very often he had changed his\r\n    mind on the morality of the measure. He owned to shooting the\r\n    Turks, and said they had broken their capitulation. He found great\r\n    fault with the French Admiral who fought the battle of the Nile,\r\n    and pointed out what he ought to have done, but he found most fault\r\n    with the Admiral who fought--R. Calder--for not disabling his\r\n    fleet, and said that if he could have got the Channel clear then,\r\n    or at any other time, he would have invaded England.\r\n\r\n    He said the Emperor of Russia was clever and had \"idées libérales,\"\r\n    but was a veritable Grec. At Tilsit, the Emperor of Russia, King of\r\n    Prussia, and N. used to dine together. They separated early--the\r\n    King of Prussia went to bed, and the two Emperors met at each\r\n    other's quarters and talked, often on abstract subjects, till late\r\n    in the night. The King of Prussia a mere corporal, and the Emperor\r\n    of Austria very prejudiced--\"d'ailleurs honnête homme.\"\r\n\r\n    Berthier quite a pen-and-ink man--but \"bon diable qui servit le\r\n    premier, à me témoigner ses regrets, les larmes aux yeux.\"\r\n\r\n    Metternich a man of the world, \"courtisan des femmes,\" but too\r\n    false to be a good statesman-\"car en politique il ne faut pas étre\r\n    _trop_ menteur.\"\r\n\r\n    It was his maxim not to displace his Marshals, which he had carried\r\n    to a fault in the case of Marmont, who lost his cannon by\r\n    treachery, he believed--I forget where. The Army liked him, he had\r\n    rewarded them well.\r\n\r\n    Talleyrand had been guilty of such extortion in the peace with\r\n    Austria and with Bavaria that he was complained against by those\r\n    Powers and therefore removed--it was he who advised the war with\r\n    Spain, and prevented N. from seeing the Duke d'Enghien, whom he\r\n    thought a \"brave jeune homme,\" and wished to see.\r\n\r\n    He said he had been fairly tried by a military tribunal, and the\r\n    sentence put up in every town in France, according to law.\r\n\r\n    Spain ought to have been conquered, and he should have gone there\r\n    himself had not the war with Russia occurred.\r\n\r\n    Lord Lauderdale was an English peer, but not of \"la plus belle\r\n    race.\" England will repent of bringing the Russians so far: they\r\n    will deprive her of India.\r\n\r\n    If Mr. Fox had lived, he thought he should have made peace--praised\r\n    the noble way in which the negotiation was begun by him.\r\n\r\n    The Archduke Charles he did not think a man of great abilities.\r\n    \"Tout ce que j'ai publié sur les finances est de l'Evangile,\" he\r\n    said--he allowed no _gaspillage_ and had an excellent\r\n    treasurer; owing to this he saved large sums out of his civil list.\r\n\r\n    The conscription produced 300,000 men yearly.\r\n\r\n    He thought us wrong in taking Belgium from France--he said it was\r\n    now considered as so intimately united that the loss was very\r\n    mortifying. Perhaps it would have been better, he said, to divide\r\n    France--he considered one great advantage to consist as I--(_End\r\n    of Journal_.)\r\n\r\n[22] This account is copied from the old leather-bound journal, in\r\nwhich it was written by Lord John the day after the interview;\r\nthere is no gap in the account, but the last part appears to have\r\nbeen written later, and is unfinished.\r\n\r\nDuring the session of 1813 Lord John was returned for the family borough of\r\nTavistock. He was obliged, however, principally owing to ill-health, to\r\nretire from active life at the end of three years, during which time he\r\nmade a remarkable speech against the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act.\r\nIt must have been at about this time that he thought of giving up politics\r\nand devoting himself to literature, which brought the following\r\n\"Remonstrance\" from his friend Thomas Moore:\r\n\r\nREMONSTRANCE\r\n\r\n(_After a conversation with Lord John Russell in which he had intimated\r\nsome idea of giving up all political pursuits_.)\r\n\r\n  What! _thou_, with thy genius, thy youth, and thy name--\r\n    Thou, born of a Russell--whose instinct to run\r\n  The accustomed career of thy sires, is the same\r\n    As the eaglet's to soar with his eyes on the sun.\r\n\r\n  Whose nobility comes to thee, stamped with a seal,\r\n    Far, far more ennobling than monarch e'er set,\r\n  With the blood of thy race, offered up for the weal\r\n    Of a nation that swears by that martyrdom yet I\r\n\r\n  Shalt _thou_ be faint-hearted and turn from the strife,\r\n    From the mighty arena, where all that is grand,\r\n  And devoted and pure, and adorning in life,\r\n    'Tis for high-thoughted spirits like thine to command?\r\n\r\n  Oh no, never dream it--while good men despair\r\n    Between tyrants and traitors, and timid men bow,\r\n  Never think, for an instant, thy country can spare\r\n    Such a light from her darkening horizon as thou.\r\n\r\n  With a spirit as meek as the gentlest of those\r\n    Who in life's sunny valley lie sheltered and warm;\r\n  Yet bold and heroic as ever yet rose\r\n    To the top cliffs of Fortune and breasted her storm;\r\n\r\n  With an ardour for liberty, fresh as in youth\r\n    It first kindles the bard and gives life to his lyre,\r\n  Yet mellowed even now by that mildness of truth\r\n    Which tempers, but chills not, the patriot fire;\r\n\r\n  With an eloquence--not like those rills from a height,\r\n    Which sparkle and foam, and in vapour are o'er;\r\n  But a current that works out its way into light\r\n    Through the filtering recesses of thought and of lore.\r\n\r\n  Thus gifted, thou never canst sleep in the shade;\r\n    If the stirrings of Genius, the music of fame,\r\n  And the charms of thy cause have not power to persuade,\r\n    Yet think how to Freedom thou'rt pledged by thy Name.\r\n\r\n  Like the boughs of that laurel, by Delphi's decree,\r\n    Set apart for the Fane and its service divine,\r\n  So the branches that spring from the old Russell tree,\r\n    Are by Liberty _claimed_ for the use of her shrine.\r\n\r\n                                    THOMAS MOORE.\r\n\r\nIn spite of strong literary proclivities it would certainly have been a\r\nwrench to Lord John to leave the stirring scenes of Parliamentary life, and\r\nhis feeling about it may be gathered from a letter written to his brother\r\nin 1841:\r\n\r\n    _Lord John Russell to the Duke of Bedford_\r\n\r\n    ENDSLEIGH, _October_ 13, 1841\r\n\r\n    Whatever may be said about other families, I do not think ours\r\n    ought to retire from active exertion. In all times of popular\r\n    movement the Russells have been on the \"forward\" side. At the\r\n    Reformation the first Earl of Bedford, in Charles the First's days\r\n    Francis the great Earl, in Charles the Second's William, Lord\r\n    Russell, in later times Francis Duke of Bedford--my\r\n    father--you--and lastly myself in the Reform Bill.\r\n\r\nAt the General Election in 1818 Lord John was again elected for Tavistock,\r\nand began to make the furtherance of Parliamentary Reform his particular\r\naim. In 1820 he became member for Huntingdonshire. Henceforward, whenever\r\nthe question of Reform came before the House, Lord John was recognized as\r\nits most prominent supporter. As early as 1822 he moved that \"the present\r\nstate of representation of the people in Parliament requires the most\r\nserious consideration of the House.\" In 1828 he succeeded in carrying the\r\nrepeal of the Test and Corporation Acts. He was also an ardent supporter of\r\nthe Catholic Relief Bill. Thus in religious, educational, and parliamentary\r\nquestions he stood up stoutly for liberty. When Lord Grey succeeded the\r\nDuke of Wellington, Lord John took a large part in drafting the famous\r\nmeasure of Reform, and the Bill of 1831 was introduced by him; after which\r\nspeech he became the most popular man in England. Beaten in Committee, the\r\nReform party appealed to the country and returned with a larger majority.\r\nOn June 24, 1831. he introduced the Bill for the second time.\r\n\r\nThis Bill, after being carried in the House of Commons, was rejected by the\r\nHouse of Lords, and it was not till June, 1832. that the great Reform Bill\r\n(the third introduced within twelve months) became the law of the land.\r\nLord John, who had been admitted to the Cabinet in 1831 during Lord Grey's\r\nGovernment, became Home Secretary in Lord Melbourne's Government in 1835,\r\nand in 1839 he was appointed Colonial Secretary, which office he held at\r\nthe time of his second marriage. Up to this point we have only followed his\r\ncareer at a distance, but now through the letters and diaries of his wife\r\nwe shall be enabled to follow it more intimately to the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n1841-45\r\n\r\n\r\nLord and Lady John Russell stayed at Bowhill till the 31st of July. They\r\nhad a grand reception at Selkirk on their way back to Minto--a procession\r\nheaded by all the magistrates, a band of music, and banners flying. Lord\r\nJohn was given the freedom of the burgh, and was received with enthusiasm\r\nby the inhabitants. After a short visit to Minto they went to London, to\r\nhis house in Wilton Crescent.\r\n\r\n    BOWHILL, _July_ 29, 1841\r\n\r\n    I hardly know how to begin my journal again. I wrote the last page\r\n    as Fanny Elliot; I am now Fanny Russell.... Forgive me, Almighty\r\n    Father, for the manifold sins, errors, and omissions of my past\r\n    life, [a life] to which I look back with deep gratitude for its\r\n    countless blessings, especially for the affection of those with\r\n    whom I spent it, so far beyond what I deserved. Enable me to think\r\n    calmly of the Mother whom I have left.... I was, and still am, in a\r\n    dream; but one from which I hope never to wake, which I trust will\r\n    only grow sweeter as the bitter days of parting wear away, as I\r\n    become more and more the companion and friend of him whose heart is\r\n    mine as truly as mine is his, and in whom I see all the strength\r\n    and goodness that my weak and erring nature so much requires.\r\n\r\n    This is a perfect place and the days have flown--each walk lovelier\r\n    than the last. Much as poets have sung Ettrick and Yarrow, they\r\n    have not, and cannot, sing enough to satisfy me.... I am so sorry\r\n    that to-morrow is our last day, though it is to Minto that we go,\r\n    but I feel as if a spell would be broken--a spell of such\r\n    enchantment.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    30, WILTON CRESCENT, _August_ 13, 1841 I say nothing of the\r\n    day we left Minto, which could not help being of that kind that one\r\n    hardly dares to look back to.... We were received with great\r\n    honours at Hawick--bells ringing, flags flying, and I should think\r\n    the whole population assembled to cheer us--it is very agreeable\r\n    that people should be wise enough to see his merits, particularly\r\n    as he does his best to avoid all such exhibitions of popular\r\n    feeling. I like to see his shy looks on such occasions, as it gives\r\n    him less right to abuse me for mine on many others.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILTON CRESCENT, _August_ 14, 1841\r\n\r\n    We arrived here on Thursday evening. Lord John did all he could to\r\n    make it less strange to me; but how strange it was--and still is.\r\n    We had a visit from Papa and Henry; my first visitors in _my own\r\n    house_. The children arrived from Ramsgate all well. Oh, Father\r\n    in Heaven, strengthen me in the path of righteousness that I may be\r\n    a mother to these dear children.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILTON CRESCENT, _August_ 15, 1841\r\n\r\n    Dear Baby a great deal with me. She and Georgy call me Mama. It was\r\n    too much--such a mixture of great happiness, anxiety, novelty,\r\n    painful recollections, longing to make him happy--impossibility of\r\n    saying all I so deeply feel from the fear of giving him pain. Oh! I\r\n    thought I should quite fail.\r\n\r\n    Oh, what a weight seemed to be taken off my heart when at night,\r\n    after speaking about the children, he mentioned their mother. Now I\r\n    feel that the greatest bar to perfect confidence between us is\r\n    removed. God bless him for the effort.\r\n\r\nIn August, soon after the meeting of Parliament, Lord Melbourne's\r\nGovernment was defeated on the Address and resigned.\r\n\r\n    WILTON CRESCENT, _August_ 28, 1841\r\n\r\n    Lord John dined at Lansdowne House--a last Cabinet dinner....\r\n    Letter from the Queen to Lord John, which for a moment overcame\r\n    him--she does indeed lose a faithful adviser, and deeply does he\r\n    feel it for his country and her. Oh, I never loved him so well; his\r\n    mind rises with reverse. It is no small matter for a man whose\r\n    whole soul is intent on the good of his country to be stopt in his\r\n    high career--to be, apparently at least, rejected by that\r\n    country--but no, the people are still and will be more and more\r\n    with him, and his career will still be great and glorious.... And\r\n    to me he has never shone so brightly as now--so cheerful, so calm,\r\n    so hopeful for the great principles for which he falls--and yet, as\r\n    that moment showed, regretting the event so deeply.\r\n\r\nThey went down to stay a few days with the Duke of Bedford, and she notes\r\nin her diary:\r\n\r\n    Continued to like Woburn better and better. Some people went and\r\n    others came, among the last, Lord Melbourne. Lord Melbourne did\r\n    not, I thought, appear to advantage; he showed little wish for\r\n    conversation with anybody, but seemed trying to banish the thoughts\r\n    of his reverse by talking nonsense with some of the ladies.\r\n\r\nThe elections which followed the defeat of the Melbourne Ministry gave the\r\nTories a majority of over eighty seats. Peel was joined by Lord Ripon, Lord\r\nStanley, and others, who had supported Lord Grey during the Reform Bill.\r\nThe Whig Party were in a discomfited condition. They did not look back on\r\ntheir past term of office with much satisfaction; they had been constantly\r\nin a minority; and although such useful measures as Rowland Hill's Penny\r\nPostage had been carried, nothing had been done to meet the most urgent\r\nneeds of the time.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Bedford had placed Endsleigh at Lord John's disposal, and next\r\nmonth he travelled down with Lady John to Devonshire. Endsleigh is one of\r\nthe most beautiful places in Devonshire; it is near the little town of\r\nTavistock, where Drake was born. The house looks down from a height on the\r\nlovely wooded slopes of the River Tamar. In letters to his brother Lord\r\nJohn had said of Endsleigh, \"It is the place I am most fond of in the\r\nworld.\" \"I think no place so beautiful for walks and drives.\" He and Lady\r\nJohn always retained the happiest memories of their life there.\r\n\r\n    ENDSLEIGH, _October_ 22, 1841\r\n\r\n    Long delightful shooting walk with Lord John--delightful although\r\n    so many songs, poems, and sentiments of my greatest favourites\r\n    against shooting were running in my head to strengthen the horror\r\n    that I and all women must have of it.\r\n\r\n      \"Inhuman man--curse on thy barbarous art.\"\r\n\r\n    Inhuman woman to countenance his barbarity!\r\n\r\n\r\n    ENDSLEIGH, _October_ 26, 1841\r\n\r\n    Such a day! White frost in the morning, sparkling in the brightest\r\n    sun, which shone all day. The trees looking redder and yellower\r\n    from the deep blue sky beyond--the different distances of the hills\r\n    so marked--the river shining like silver. Oh, what a day! We were\r\n    prepared for it by the beauty of last night--such that I could\r\n    scarcely bring myself to shut my window and go to bed. A snow-white\r\n    mist over all except the garden below my eyes and the tops of the\r\n    hills beyond, and a bright moon \"tipping with silver every mountain\r\n    head.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    ENDSLEIGH, _November_ 11, 1841\r\n\r\n    With Lord John to hear an examination of the School at Milton\r\n    Abbot. He gave prizes and made a little speech in praise of master\r\n    and boys, which made him and, I think, me more nervous than any of\r\n    the speeches I have heard from him in the House of Commons. I do\r\n    not know why it should have been affecting, but it was so.... Walk\r\n    with him in the dusk--his kindness, his tenderness are the joy of\r\n    my life.\r\n\r\nHer marriage had brought her greater happiness than she had thought\r\npossible. Writing to her mother from Endsleigh on November 15th, she says:\r\n\r\n    How little I thought on my last birthday how it would be before my\r\n    next. I looked in my journal to see about it and found it full of\r\n    _him_; but not exactly as I should write now--reproaching\r\n    myself for not returning the affection of one whose character I\r\n    admired and liked so much. I should have been rightly punished by\r\n    his thinking no more about me; but then, to be sure, I should not\r\n    have known what my loss was. He said a few days ago that he hoped\r\n    it would be a happy birthday--said it as humbly as he always speaks\r\n    of his powers of making me so--yet he must know that a brighter\r\n    could not have dawned upon me, and that he is the cause....\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord John Russell to Lady Minto_\r\n\r\n    ENDSLEIGH, _November_ 23, 1841\r\n\r\n    Fanny's own letters will have given you the best insight into her\r\n    feelings since we came here. It has been the most fortunate thing\r\n    for us all. Fanny herself, Addy, Georgy, Miss Lister, and indeed\r\n    all of us, have had means of fitting and _cementing_ here,\r\n    which no London or visiting life could have given us. I never can\r\n    be sufficiently grateful for such a blessing as Fanny is to me; and\r\n    I only feel the more grateful that she reconciles herself so well\r\n    to the loss of the home she loved so well. Nor is this by loving\r\n    you or any one she has left at all the less--far from it, every day\r\n    proves her devotion to you and her anxiety for your happiness.\r\n\r\nThey could not take a long holiday, although Lord John was now in\r\nOpposition. Early in February the great Anti-Corn Law League bazaar was\r\nheld at Manchester, and a few days later Peel carried his sliding scale:\r\n20s. duty when corn was 57s., 12s. when the price was 60s., and 1s. when it\r\nreached 73s. Lord John proposed an amendment in favour of a fixed duty of\r\n8s.\r\n\r\n    CHESHAM PLACE, [23] _February_ 14, 1842\r\n\r\n    Beginning of Corn Law debate. Went to hear Lord John. He\r\n    began--excellent speech--attacked the measure as founded on the\r\n    same bad principle as the present corn laws; showed the absurdity\r\n    of any corn laws to make us independent of foreign countries; the\r\n    cruelty of doing nothing to relieve the distress of the\r\n    manufacturing districts; the different results of a sliding scale\r\n    and a fixed duty; the advantages of free trade, even with all\r\n    countries, especially with the United States, etc., etc.; was much\r\n    cheered. Answered by Mr. Gladstone, beside whose wife I was\r\n    sitting.\r\n\r\n[23] Lord John had built a house, 37, Chesham Place, which was henceforward\r\ntheir London home.\r\n\r\nLord John's amendment was lost by 123 votes; Villiers' and Brougham's\r\namendments in favour of total repeal by over three hundred. This measure of\r\nthe sliding scale did not embody Peel's real conviction at the time; its\r\nobject was to discover how much the agricultural party would stand.\r\nGladstone himself was in favour of a more liberal reduction in the sliding\r\nscale; and it appears from his journal that he very nearly resigned the\r\nPresidency of the Board of Trade in consequence of Peel's measure. Peel\r\nasked Gladstone to reply to Lord John Russell. \"This I did,\" he says, \"and\r\nwith all my heart, for I did not yet fully understand the vicious operation\r\nof the sliding scale on the corn trade, and it is hard to see how an\r\neight-shilling duty could even then have been maintained.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the next ten months Lord and Lady John were less at the mercy of\r\npolitics than they were destined to be for many years to come. They were\r\nconstantly together, either at Chesham Place or at Endsleigh. Lord Minto\r\nwas living near them in London.\r\n\r\n    _Lord Minto to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _March_ 1, 1843\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MARY,--I think you will be glad to have my report of Fanny\r\n    since I have been established almost next door to her, and the more\r\n    so as it will be so favourable. For whatever misgivings I may have\r\n    had from difference of age, or the cares of a ready-made nursery of\r\n    children, have entirely gone off. I really never saw anybody more\r\n    thoroughly or naturally happy, or upon a footing of more perfect\r\n    ease and confidence and equality. I forget if you know Lord John\r\n    well behind the scenes, but there is a simplicity and gentleness\r\n    and purity in his character which is quite delightful, and it\r\n    chimes in very fortunately with Fanny's. She has drawn prizes, too,\r\n    in the children, who are really as nice a little tribe as can be\r\n    imagined, and I reckon myself a good judge of such small stock.\r\n    They are very comfortably housed, much better than I ever hope to\r\n    be in London, and Fanny seems to govern her establishment very\r\n    handily. I don't know that she has yet quite brought herself to\r\n    believe that there is anybody in the world so wicked as really to\r\n    intend to cheat, or to overcharge, or to neglect her work for their\r\n    own pleasure, but I suppose she will make this discovery in\r\n    time....\r\n\r\n    Adieu, dearest Mary, I have such a craving to see you again that I\r\n    hardly know how I shall keep myself within bounds on this side of\r\n    the Channel.\r\n\r\n    Your affectionate,\r\n\r\n    MINTO\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Minto to Lord John Russell_\r\n\r\n    MINTO, _March_ 5, 1842\r\n\r\n    You can now be pretty well aware of what my delight will be to see\r\n    my dear Fanny again, and to know her tolerably well; but you have\r\n    not lived with her five-and-twenty years, and therefore memory has\r\n    no place in your affection for her, and you cannot even now\r\n    comprehend the blank she makes to me. But you can well comprehend\r\n    the extent of my pleasure in reading her letters, which breathe\r\n    happiness in every line, and in hearing from everybody of her good\r\n    looks and cheerfulness. My only fear for her is an anxiety, natural\r\n    considering the great change, that her cares and occupations may\r\n    weigh at times too heavily upon her, and that she will not wish you\r\n    to see she feels it. This is the only thing she would conceal from\r\n    you; but as I know the sort of feelings she formerly endeavoured to\r\n    conceal from me, it is but too probable she has the same fault\r\n    still, and nothing but trying to extract her feelings from her will\r\n    cure her, or at least mitigate the evil.\r\n\r\nThe next great event in their lives was the birth of their first-born son,\r\nJohn, afterwards Lord Amberley.\r\n\r\n    On the 10th of December, 1842, our dear little baby boy was born.\r\n    He has been thriving ever since to our heart's content. It has been\r\n    a happy, happy time to me, and to us all. And now I am a mother.\r\n    Oh, Heavenly Father, enable me to be one indeed and to feel that an\r\n    immortal soul is entrusted to my care.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of December, a year later, she expressed the same thought in\r\nthe following lines:\r\n\r\n  Rough winter blew thy welcome; cold on thee\r\n    Looked the cold earth, my snowdrop frail and fair.\r\n  Again that day; but wintry though it be,\r\n    Come to thy Mother's heart: no frost is there.\r\n  What sparkles in thy dark and guileless eye?\r\n    Life's joyous dawn alone undimmed by care!\r\n  Thou gift of God, canst thou then wholly die?\r\n    Oh no, a soul immortal flashes there;\r\n  And for that soul now spotless as thy cheek--\r\n    That infant form the Almighty's hand has sealed--\r\n  Oh, there are thoughts a mother ne'er can speak;\r\n    In midnight's silent prayer alone revealed.\r\n\r\nAfter Lady John had recovered, they went down to Woburn, and later to stay\r\nwith Lord Clarendon at The Grove. At both houses large parties were\r\nassembled, and Greville notes in his diary that Lord John was in excellent\r\nspirits. \"Buller goes on as if the only purpose in life was to laugh and\r\nmake others laugh,\" and he adds, \"John Russell is always agreeable, both\r\nfrom what he contributes himself and his hearty enjoyment of the\r\ncontributions of others.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the principal events which had interested Lady John in the past year\r\nhad been the secession from the Scottish Church and the establishment of\r\nthe. Free Church of Scotland. Her feelings about it are expressed in this\r\nletter to her sister, Lady Mary Abercromby:\r\n\r\n    ENDSLEIGH, _September_ 11, 1842 The divisions in the Kirk\r\n    distress me so much that I never read anything about them now. It\r\n    is disagreeable to find people with whom one cannot agree making\r\n    use of the most sacred expressions on every occasion where their\r\n    own power or interests can be helped by them. You used not to be\r\n    much of a Kirk woman; but surely you would regret seeing many of\r\n    her children come over to the English. I have just been reading the\r\n    Thirty-nine Articles for the first time in my life, and am\r\n    therefore particularly disposed to prefer all that is simple in\r\n    matters of religion. They _may_ be true; but whether they are\r\n    so or not, is what neither I, nor those who wrote them, nor the\r\n    wisest man that lives, can judge; that they are presumptuous in the\r\n    extreme, all who read may see. In short, I hate theology as the\r\n    greatest enemy of true religion, and may therefore leave the\r\n    subject to my betters.... I need hardly tell you that we are\r\n    leading a happy life, since we are at Endsleigh and _alone_.\r\n    Did I ever tell you that we are becoming great botanists? I have\r\n    some hopes of equalling you before we meet, as I feel new light\r\n    breaks upon me every day, and every night too, for I try so hard to\r\n    repress my ardour during the day for fear of being tiresome to\r\n    everybody, that my dreams are of nothing else. John, of course, is\r\n    very little advanced as yet, but he finds it so interesting, to his\r\n    surprise, that I hope even Parliament will not quite drive it out\r\n    of his head.\r\n\r\nEarly in February she was back again in London, where social and political\r\ndistractions, together with the care of a young family of stepchildren,\r\nwere soon to prove too much for her strength.\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    _February_ 7, 1843\r\n\r\n    ... How you must envy me and how I am to be envied for having my\r\n    own people within reach. I am hourly thankful for it.... Yet for\r\n    one thing I envy you--great lady as you are, you lead a quiet life;\r\n    how far from quiet mine is and always must be, and how intensely I\r\n    long that it could be more so, how completely worn out both mind\r\n    and body often feel at the end of a common day, none can imagine\r\n    but those who have become in one moment mother of six children,\r\n    wife of the Leader of the House of Commons, and mistress of a house\r\n    in London. You will suppose that I wish husband and children at the\r\n    world's end, and you will call me a sinful, discontented creature;\r\n    you will do anything but pity me, since my only complaint is that I\r\n    have not as much leisure as so much happiness requires to be\r\n    enjoyed. Well, say and think what you please; I must let you into\r\n    my secret follies, in the hope of curing myself in so doing.\r\n    London, hateful London, alone is at fault. Anywhere else my duties\r\n    and occupations would be light, and my _pleasures_ would be so\r\n    not in name only.... How _could_ I beg Mama, as I used to do,\r\n    to have more parties and dinners and balls! I cannot now conceive\r\n    the state of mind which made me actually wish for such things. Now\r\n    I have them in my power without number, and I detest them all. The\r\n    world has passed its judgment on me. I am reckoned cold, dull, and\r\n    unworthy of such a husband; and it is quite right, for I never\r\n    appear anything else. In short, I doubt my capacity for everything\r\n    except making husband and children happy--_that_ I have not\r\n    yet begun to doubt. When I do, I will instantly bid them all adieu\r\n    and \"find out some peaceful hermitage.\" ... Darling Baby was\r\n    brought in to be seen in his christening dress, the gift of Mama,\r\n    and such a little love you never saw.... Papa is the best of\r\n    Grandpapas, as you may imagine from his love of babies, and I\r\n    delight in seeing him nurse it and speak to it....\r\n\r\n    Do not think this quite a mad letter. I wrote as the spirit, good\r\n    or evil, prompted me. I must do so or not write at all....\r\n\r\n    Ever, my dearest Mary, your most affectionate sister.\r\n\r\nLady Minto was evidently afraid that her daughter was shutting herself up\r\ntoo entirely with her family, and not amusing herself as much as was good\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\n    \"My dearest Mama,\" she answers (on July 5, 1843)--... I hope to\r\n    make you laugh at yourself for your fears about me, and to convince\r\n    you that the seclusion of Belgravia, though great, is not quite\r\n    like that of Kamschatka; that John's pleasure is not my pleasure,\r\n    that the welfare of the children is not my happiness, and that far\r\n    from constantly devoting my time to them, one whole afternoon this\r\n    week was devoted to the world and the fine arts in Westminster\r\n    Hall. I will name to you a few of the friends I met there, by all\r\n    of whom I was recognized, in spite of my long banishment, my\r\n    wrinkles, and my grey hair.... [Thirty names follow.]\r\n\r\n    The evening before I had been _without_ John to a tea at Mr.\r\n    W. Russell's. To-night we are to dine with the Duke and Duchess of\r\n    Buccleuch; to-morrow to breakfast with the Duchess Dowager of\r\n    Bedford; on Thursday go to the Drawing-room and give our banquet;\r\n    and so on to the end of the session and season. Seriously, dear\r\n    Mama, if I had more of the pleasures of my age, I should dislike\r\n    them very much; those of a more tender age suit me better; and if\r\n    you do not think it unbecoming, I will have a swing and a\r\n    rocking-horse in our own garden. You ought rather to scold Papa for\r\n    shutting himself up; he has seen hardly anybody but ourselves,\r\n    which has been very agreeable for us--so agreeable that I do not at\r\n    all like his going away, tho' of course I do not try to keep him\r\n    longer when he so much wishes to go, and you so much wish to have\r\n    him....\r\n\r\n    You think I did not know what I was undertaking when we married,\r\n    and you are right. The hope, humble as it was, of lightening the\r\n    duties and cheering the life of one--the wish, God knows how\r\n    sincere, of being a mother to those who had none, outweighed all\r\n    other considerations. But if I did not know and have sometimes been\r\n    overpowered by the greatness of my duties, if I have sighed for the\r\n    repose and leisure with which marriage generally begins, neither\r\n    did I know the greatness of my rewards--so far beyond what I\r\n    deserve. The constant sympathy, encouragement, and approbation of\r\n    John can make everything easy to me; and these I trust I shall\r\n    always have; these will keep me young and merry, so do not distress\r\n    yourself about me, my own dear Mama, and believe me ever your most\r\n    affectionate child,\r\n\r\n    FANNY RUSSELL\r\n\r\nThe year 1843 was one of increasing difficulty for the Tories. Peel's\r\nfollowers began to suspect more and more strongly that he was not sound on\r\nthe question of the corn taxes; outside Parliament, Cobden and Bright were\r\nbattering Protection at their great monthly meetings in Covent Garden\r\nTheatre. The troubles in Ireland were growing acute, and the arrest of\r\nO'Connell and the Repeal leaders made matters worse. The Government had\r\nbeen forced to abandon their Bill for the education of factory children\r\nthrough the bitter opposition of Dissenters and Radicals, who thought the\r\nBill increased the already too great influence of the Church. At the\r\nbeginning of the year the Government had been strong enough to throw out\r\nLord Howick's motion for a committee of inquiry into the causes of\r\ndistress, which would have entailed a division upon the Corn Laws; but the\r\nstrength of the Ministry was now seriously diminished. Parliament was\r\nprorogued late in August; on the 5th Lord John left London, hoping that he\r\nhad done with politics till next year. The whole family moved down to\r\nEndsleigh, where, soon afterwards, his eldest stepdaughter fell ill of a\r\nfever.\r\n\r\nLady John caught the infection. She had been living up to the limit of her\r\nenergies, and her case proved a grave one. They moved to Minto in October,\r\nand never again used Endsleigh as their country house. By the beginning of\r\n1844 she was sufficiently recovered to attend the House of Commons and to\r\nhear her husband speak upon the Irish question. In this speech he declared\r\nhimself in favour of putting Catholics, Anglicans, and Dissenters on an\r\nequality; not by disestablishing the English Church in Ireland, but by\r\nendowing the Catholics. He summed up the political situation by saying: \"In\r\nEngland the government, as it should be, is a government of opinion; the\r\ngovernment of Ireland is notoriously a government by force.\"\r\n\r\n    _February_ 15, 1844\r\n\r\n    O'Connell arrived from Dublin--much cheered by the crowd outside\r\n    and by the Irish and Radical members inside the House. John shook\r\n    hands with him. O'Connell said: \"I thank you for your admirable\r\n    speech. It makes up to us for much that we have gone through.\"\r\n\r\nLady John's next Diary was lost, and the first entry in her new Diary was\r\nwritten after serious illness.\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _February_ 2, 1845\r\n\r\n    I have found in illness even more than in health how much better I\r\n    am loved than I deserve to be. To say nothing of the unwearied care\r\n    and cheerful watching of my dearest John, the children have given\r\n    me such proofs of affection as gladdened many an hour of pain or\r\n    weariness. One day, while I was ill in bed, and Georgy by me, I\r\n    told her how kind it was of God to send illness upon us at times,\r\n    as warnings to repent of past faults and prepare for death. Upon\r\n    which she said: \"But, Mama, _you_ can't have done anything to\r\n    be sorry for.\" No self-examination, no sermon, could have made me\r\n    feel more humble than these words of a little child.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the year, while Lord John was supporting in the\r\nHouse of Commons the endowment of the Maynooth College for priests and the\r\nestablishment of colleges in other important Irish towns, Lady John was\r\nliving at Unsted Wood, near Godalming, a house they had taken for the year.\r\n\r\nTheir constant separation was painful to both, and as soon as Parliament\r\nrose they decided to go to Minto. There the state of her health became so\r\nalarming that, to be within reach of medical advice, they moved to\r\nEdinburgh.\r\n\r\nThe distress of the poorer classes throughout the country during this\r\nautumn was terrible. It was to meet this distress, unparalleled since the\r\nMiddle Ages, that Lord John wrote from Edinburgh his famous Free Trade\r\nletter to his London constituents, urging them to clamour for the only\r\nremedy, \"to unite to put an end to a system which has proved to be the\r\nblight of commerce, the bane of agriculture, the source of bitter divisions\r\namong classes, the cause of penury, fever, mortality, and crime among the\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards he was called to London by the sudden death of his old\r\nfriend Lady Holland, and he had hardly returned when the news of Peel's\r\nresignation reached him. Peel, thoroughly alarmed, had called a Cabinet\r\nCouncil to consider the repeal of the Corn Laws. Lord Stanley, afterwards\r\nLord Derby, had strongly dissented, and carried several Ministers with him,\r\nthus compelling Peel to resign.\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    EDINBURGH, _December_ 2, 1845\r\n\r\n    I wonder what Ralph and William will say to John's letter to his\r\n    electors. It is what I have long wished, and I am delighted that\r\n    the chief barrier between him and the Radical part of the Whig\r\n    party should be knocked down by it. In short, _patriotically_\r\n    I am quite pleased, but _privately_ far from it; I dread its\r\n    being a stepping-stone to office, which, not to mention myself,\r\n    would kill him very soon. He has already quite as much work as his\r\n    health can stand, so what would it be with office in\r\n    _addition?_ However, I do not torment myself with a future\r\n    which may never come, or which, if it does, I may never see. I\r\n    forget whether I have written since poor Lady Holland's death,\r\n    which John felt very much. It is sad that her death should have\r\n    startled one as only that of a young person generally does; but,\r\n    old as she was, she never appeared so, and she belonged as much to\r\n    society as she ever did. Poor woman, it is a comfort that she died\r\n    so calmly, whatever it was that enabled her to do so.\r\n\r\nLord John had hardly returned to Edinburgh when the event which she had\r\nbeen trying to think remote and unlikely was upon them.\r\n\r\n    EDINBURGH, _December_ 8, 1845\r\n\r\n    Evening of utter consternation. A message from the Queen requiring\r\n    John's attendance at Osborne House immediately.... John set out at\r\n    ten this morning (December 9th) on his dreary and anxious journey,\r\n    leaving a dreary and anxious wife behind him. Baby not well towards\r\n    evening. Sent for Dr. Davidson. Oh, Heavenly Father, preserve to me\r\n    my earthly treasures, and whatever be my lot in life, they will\r\n    make it a happy one. Forgive me for such a prayer. The hope of\r\n    happiness is too strong within me.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord John to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _December_ 10, 1845\r\n\r\n    It is very sad, this moment, when many will think me at the height\r\n    of my ambition. But when I think of you and your many trials, and\r\n    the children with their ailments to disturb you, when I cannot\r\n    share your anxieties--it is all very sad. I doubt, too, of the will\r\n    of the country to go through with it--and then I shall have done\r\n    mischief by calling upon them. I saw Mr. Bright at one of the\r\n    stations. He spoke much of the enthusiasm. God save and preserve us\r\n    all.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord John to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    OSBORNE HOUSE, _December_ 11th, 1845\r\n\r\n    Well, I am here--and have seen Her Majesty. It is proposed to me to\r\n    form a Government, and nothing can be more gracious than the manner\r\n    in which this has been done. Likewise Sir Robert Peel has placed\r\n    his views on paper, and they are such as very much to facilitate my\r\n    task. Can I do so wild a thing? For this purpose, and to know\r\n    whether it is wild or not, I must consult my friends.... There end\r\n    politics--I hope you have not suffered from anxiety and the\r\n    desolation of our domestic prospects.... I stay here to-night, and\r\n    summon my friends in London to-morrow--Ever, ever affly., with love\r\n    to all,\r\n\r\n    J.R.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John to Lord John Russell_\r\n\r\n    EDINBURGH, _December_ 13, 1845\r\n\r\n    I have just read your note which I so anxiously expected from\r\n    Osborne House. No, my dearest, it is not a wild thing. It is a\r\n    great duty which you will nobly perform; and, with all my\r\n    regrets--with the conviction that private happiness to the degree\r\n    we have enjoyed is at an end if you are Prime Minister--still I\r\n    sincerely hope that no timid friend will dissuade you from at least\r\n    trying what you have yourself called upon the country to help you\r\n    in. If I liked it better, I should feel less certain it was a duty.\r\n    If you had not written that letter you might perhaps have made an\r\n    honourable escape; but now I see none.\r\n\r\nShe wrote again on the 14th:\r\n\r\n    I am as eager and anxious lying here on my sofa--a broken-down,\r\n    useless bit of rubbish--as if I were well and strong and in the\r\n    midst of the turmoil. And I am proud to find that even the prospect\r\n    of what you too truly call the \"desolation of our domestic\r\n    prospects,\" though the words go to my very heart of hearts, cannot\r\n    shake my wish that you should make the attempt. My mind is made\r\n    up.... My ambition is that you should be the head of the most moral\r\n    and religious government the country has ever had.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    EDINBURGH, _December_ 14, 1845\r\n\r\n    DEAREST MARY,--All you say of your dreams for me in days gone by is\r\n    like yourself. You were always thinking more of my happiness than\r\n    your own. What a strange world it is, where the happiest and\r\n    saddest events are so often linked together--for instance, the\r\n    marriage and absence of those one would wish to have always by one.\r\n    I certainly never wish either of our marriages _undone;_ but\r\n    \"Seas between us braid hae roared sin auld Lang-syne\" more than\r\n    either of us could have borne to look forward to. If ever I did\r\n    wish myself freed from my husband, it has been for the last five\r\n    days, since the highest honour in the land has been within his\r\n    reach. Oh dear! how unworthy I am of what to many wives would be a\r\n    source of constant pride, not only for their husband's sake, but\r\n    their own; whereas, proud as I _am_ of so public a mark of his\r\n    country's good opinion, and convinced as I am that he ought not to\r\n    shrink from the post, still to myself it is all loss, all\r\n    sacrifice--every favourite plan upset--London, London, London, and\r\n    London in its worst shape--a constant struggle between husband and\r\n    children, constant anxiety about his health and theirs, added to\r\n    that about public affairs. But I will not begin to count up the\r\n    countless miseries of office to those who have, I will not say a\r\n    love, but a passion for quiet, leisure, and the country.\r\n\r\n    As I said before, I am so convinced that he ought to make the\r\n    trial, unless the difficulties are much greater than I have wisdom\r\n    to see, that I should be positively disappointed if I found he had\r\n    given it up.\r\n\r\n    Besides, I see many bright sides to it all. You will think I have\r\n    lost all my old patriotism, but it is not so; and the prospect of\r\n    seeing my husband repeal the Corn Laws, and pacify and settle\r\n    Ireland, is one that repays me for much private regret. You see, if\r\n    he does undertake to govern, I expect him to do it successfully,\r\n    and this in spite of many a wise friend. He went off looking so\r\n    miserable himself that I long to hear from somebody else how he\r\n    looks now. You cannot think what a thunderbolt it was to us both.\r\n    We were reading aloud, about an hour before bedtime, when the\r\n    messenger was announced--and he brought the Queen's fatal letter.\r\n    Oh! how difficult I found it not to call the man every sort of\r\n    name! The next morning John was off, and though he flattered\r\n    himself he would be able to come back to me in any case, _I_\r\n    flatter myself no such thing.\r\n\r\n    Poor baby made his resolution falter that morning--he would not\r\n    leave him for a moment, clinging round his neck and laying his\r\n    little cheek on his, coaxing him in every possible way. He does not\r\n    conceal either from himself or me how entire the sacrifice must be\r\n    of private happiness to public duty, of which this parting was the\r\n    first sample; and he writes of the desolation of domestic prospects\r\n    in so sad a way that I am obliged to write like a Spartan to him.\r\n\r\nWhat her feelings were at this time the above letter shows. What was\r\nhappening in London may be gathered from Lord John's letters and the\r\nfollowing letter from Macaulay to his sister: [24]\r\n\r\n    \"... Lord John has not consented to form a Ministry. He has only\r\n    told the Queen that he would consult his friends, and see what\r\n    could be done. We are all most unwilling to take office, and so is\r\n    he. I have never seen his natural audacity of spirit so much\r\n    tempered by discretion, and by a sense of responsibility, as on\r\n    this occasion. The question of the Corn Laws throws all other\r\n    questions into the shade. Yet, even if that question were out of\r\n    the way, there would be matters enough to perplex us. Ireland, we\r\n    fear, is on the brink of something like a civil war--the effect,\r\n    not of Repeal agitation, but of severe distress endured by the\r\n    peasantry. Foreign Politics look dark. An augmentation of the Army\r\n    will be necessary. Pretty legacies to leave to a Ministry which\r\n    will be in a minority in both Houses. I have no doubt that there is\r\n    not a single man among us who would not at once refuse to enlist,\r\n    if he could do so with a clear conscience. Nevertheless, our\r\n    opinion is that, if we have reasonable hope of being able to settle\r\n    the all-important question of the Corn Laws in a satisfactory way,\r\n    we ought, at whatever sacrifice of quiet and comfort, to take\r\n    office, though only for a few weeks. But can we entertain such a\r\n    hope? This is the point; and till we are satisfied about it we\r\n    cannot positively accept or refuse. A few days must pass before we\r\n    are able to decide.\r\n\r\n    \"It is clear that we cannot win the battle with our own unassisted\r\n    strength. If we win it at all, it must be by the help of Peel,\r\n    Graham, and their friends. Peel has not seen Lord John; but he left\r\n    with the Queen a memorandum, containing a promise to support a Corn\r\n    Bill founded on the principles of Lord John's famous letter to the\r\n    electors of London.\"\r\n\r\n[24] Trevelyan's \"Life and Letters of Lord Macaulay.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord John to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    CHESHAM PLACE, _December_ 14, 1845\r\n\r\n    Well, my friends agreed with me that, unless I could have a very\r\n    good prospect of carrying a grand measure about corn, I had better\r\n    decline the Queen's Commission. So we are to have all the old\r\n    Cabinet men here on Tuesday, and try to ascertain whether we are\r\n    agreed on a measure, and whether Sir Robert Peel would support such\r\n    a measure as we should propose. On Wednesday evening, or Thursday,\r\n    I hope the matter will be cleared up, and if you ask me what I\r\n    think, I should say it is most probable that we shall be made into\r\n    a Ministry. How very strange and incomprehensible it seems; and\r\n    much as I have had to do with public affairs, I feel now as if I\r\n    knew nothing about them, and was quite incompetent to so great an\r\n    office--to rule over such vast concerns, with such parties. With so\r\n    many great things and so many little things to decide it is quite\r\n    appalling.\r\n\r\n    Many of our friends say I ought to decline; but I feel that to do\r\n    so would be mean and dastardly while I have a prospect of such\r\n    great good before me--possible if not probable, but I think even\r\n    probable. It would seem that most of the Cabinet thought I should\r\n    have a better chance of preventing bitter attacks than Peel would.\r\n    This may be so, or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord John to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    CHESHAM PLACE, _December_ 17, 1845\r\n\r\n    I want a security that I shall be able to carry a total repeal of\r\n    the Corn Laws without delay, and that security must consist in an\r\n    assurance of Sir Robert Peel's support. Unless I get this, I give\r\n    up the task.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John to Lord John Russell_\r\n\r\n    MINTO, _Sunday, December_ 21, 1845\r\n\r\n    It is difficult to write while our suspense lasts.... It does not\r\n    seem unlikely that Lord Grey [25] will have yielded, and all be\r\n    smooth, or _smoother,_ again. Papa tells me not to wish it\r\n    even on public grounds. On private ones I certainly do not; but I\r\n    should be ashamed if at such a time my anxieties were not chiefly\r\n    for you as a _statesman,_ not as my husband, and for my\r\n    country more than for myself. If it turns out that the interests of\r\n    the statesman and the country and the wife agree, why then let us\r\n    be thankful; if not, why then let us be thankful still that we can\r\n    make some sacrifice to duty. You see that my \"courage mounteth with\r\n    occasion\"; and though I have low and gloomy fits when I think of my\r\n    ill-health and its probable consequences, I am sure that, on the\r\n    whole, I shall not disgrace you. Oh, what a week of toil and\r\n    trouble you have had, and how gladly I would have shared them with\r\n    you to more purpose than I can do at this _terrible_\r\n    distance.... It is so pleasant to write to you. When I have\r\n    finished my letter I always grow sad, as if I was really saying\r\n    good-bye to you. How have you been sleeping? and eating? and have\r\n    you walked every day? ... Good-bye, Heaven bless you, my dearest\r\n    love. I trust that this has been a day of rest to you, and that God\r\n    hears and accepts our prayers for one another.\r\n\r\n[25] Third Earl Grey, son of the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nLord John wrote daily to his wife, and the following three letters to her\r\nshow what he felt during this anxious time:\r\n\r\n    CHESHAM PLACE, _December_ 19, 1845\r\n\r\n    It is all at an end. Howick [Lord Grey] would not serve with Lord\r\n    Palmerston as Foreign Secretary, and it was impossible for me to go\r\n    on unless I had both. I am very happy ... at the result. I think\r\n    that for the present it will tend much to our happiness; and power\r\n    may come, some day or other, in a less odious shape.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHESHAM PLACE, _December_ 20, 1845\r\n\r\n    I write to you with a great sense of relief on public affairs. Lord\r\n    Grey's objection to sitting in a Cabinet in which Palmerston was to\r\n    have the Foreign Office was invincible. I could not make a Cabinet\r\n    without Lord Grey, and I have therefore been to Windsor this\r\n    morning to resign my hard task. The Queen, as usual, was very\r\n    gracious.... I have left a paper with her in which I state that we\r\n    were prepared to advise free trade in corn without gradation and\r\n    without delay; but that I could support Sir Robert Peel in any\r\n    measure which he should think more practicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHESHAM PLACE, _December_ 21, 1845\r\n\r\n    The desponding tone of your letter, yesterday, although I do not\r\n    believe it was otherwise than the effect of weakness, makes me\r\n    rejoice at my escape a thousand times more than I should otherwise\r\n    have done. I reflect on the misery I should have felt with every\r\n    moment of my time occupied here in details of appointments, while\r\n    my thoughts were with you.... The Queen and the Prince have behaved\r\n    beautifully throughout.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    MINTO, _December_ 24, 1845\r\n\r\n    You will not be surprised that a great deal of the time which I\r\n    meant to devote to you this morning has run away in talk to my\r\n    husband. You will see by the _Times_ what the _cause_ of\r\n    the failure is: Lord Grey's refusal to belong to the Ministry if\r\n    Lord Palmerston was at the Foreign Office--a most unfortunate\r\n    cause, we must all agree, but in the opinion of Papa and many other\r\n    wise people, a most fortunate occurrence on the whole, as they\r\n    considered it next to impossible that such a Ministry as John could\r\n    have formed would have been strong enough to be of use to the\r\n    country.\r\n\r\n    My husband, who is no coward, sees it differently, and thinks that\r\n    with a united Cabinet he _might_ have gone on successfully and\r\n    carried not only Corn Law Repeal, but other great questions; though\r\n    the probability was that they would only have carried that and then\r\n    gone out. But even that would have been something worth doing, and\r\n    better and more naturally done by Whigs than Tories. One good thing\r\n    is that John has returned in excellent spirits. _All_ his\r\n    personal wishes and feelings were so against taking office at\r\n    present, and the foretaste he had of it in this lonely and most\r\n    harassing fortnight was so odious to him that his only feeling at\r\n    first when he gave it all up was pure delight; and he slept, which\r\n    he had not been able to do before. It certainly was a terrible\r\n    prospect to us both--one immovable in Edinburgh, the other equally\r\n    immovable in London--and it required all my patriotism to wish the\r\n    thing to go on.\r\n\r\nIf it had gone on, the name of Lord John Russell would be now more often on\r\nmen's lips. Peel's popular fame rests upon the abolition of the Corn Laws,\r\nLord John's upon the first Reform Bill. It was but an accident--Lord Grey's\r\nobjection to Palmerston at the Foreign Office--which prevented the name of\r\nLord John Russell from being linked with those of Cobden and Bright, and\r\nimperishably associated with both the great measures of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n1846\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Lord John's failure to form a Ministry, Peel returned to power;\r\nGladstone replaced Stanley at the War and Colonial Office, and Stanley\r\nbecame the acknowledged leader of the protectionist Opposition. Having Lord\r\nJohn's assurance that the Whigs would support anti-Corn Law legislation,\r\nPeel set about preparing his famous measure. But before it could be\r\ndiscussed in Parliament, the usual explanations with regard to resignation\r\nand resumption of office had to be gone through. In his speech on this\r\noccasion, Lord John tried to shield Lord Grey as far as possible from the\r\nunpopularity which he had incurred by refusing to work with Palmerston in\r\nthe same Cabinet. Feeling on both sides of the House was against Lord Grey;\r\nfor both Free Traders and Protectionists thought that Repeal ought to have\r\ncome from the Whigs, and that it was Lord Grey who had made this\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nLady John remained in Edinburgh, too ill to move. While her husband was\r\nhelping Peel at Westminster, the following letters passed between them:\r\n\r\n    _Lord John to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _January 23,_ 1846\r\n\r\n    I did not write to you last night, as I thought I could give you a\r\n    clearer account to-day. Sir Robert Peel gave up Protection\r\n    altogether on the ground that he had changed his opinion.... I dine\r\n    with the Fox Club [to-day?] and at Lansdowne House to-morrow. I\r\n    have rather startled Lord Lansdowne this morning by some of my\r\n    views about Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John to Lord John Russell_\r\n\r\n    EDINBURGH, _January_ 25, 1846\r\n\r\n    I never doubted that you were as noble by nature as by name; and I\r\n    am now more happily convinced of it than ever. Your whole speech\r\n    was plain and excellent, but the part that I dwell upon with the\r\n    greatest pleasure is that about Lord Grey.... I generally think\r\n    your speeches a curious contrast to Sir Robert's, and it does not\r\n    fail on this occasion. His humble confession of former errors, his\r\n    appeal to our sympathies, and his heroic tone at the close, all got\r\n    rather the better of my reason while I read; but the more I think\r\n    over his conduct, the less becomes the effect of his words. Yours,\r\n    on the contrary, as usual, only gain in force the more they are\r\n    reflected on, simply because they are true. And now, having\r\n    congratulated you quite as much as is good for your vanity, I must\r\n    praise myself a little for the way in which I have hitherto borne\r\n    your absence. What with its present pain, the uncertainty as to\r\n    when it may end, and my varying and wearying state of health, I\r\n    have many a time been inclined to lie and cry; and if ever I\r\n    allowed myself to dwell in thought on the happy days which sad\r\n    memory brings to light, I _should_ lie and cry; those days\r\n    when neither night nor day could take me from your side, and when\r\n    it was as difficult to look forward to sickness or sorrow as it now\r\n    is to believe that health and happiness--such happiness as\r\n    that--are in store for us. But I do _not_ dwell upon past\r\n    enjoyments, but upon present blessings, and I _do_ lie and\r\n    talk and read and write and think cheerfully and gratefully.\r\n\r\n    Dearest, I know you cannot see much of the children, but when you\r\n    do, pray be both Papa and Mama to them. Do not let their little\r\n    minds grow reserved towards you, or your _great_ mind towards\r\n    them. Help them to apply what they hear you read from the Bible to\r\n    their own little daily pleasures and cares, and you will find how\r\n    delightfully they take it all in.\r\n\r\n    God bless you, my dearest. Pray go out every day, and take Isabel\r\n    and Bessy or one of the small ones with you sometimes to enliven\r\n    you.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John to Lord John Russell_\r\n\r\n    EDINBURGH, _January_ 26, 1846\r\n\r\n    Your mention of the dreams which you had had of happiness for\r\n    Ireland made me sad, and you know how I shared in those dreams....\r\n    I like the way in which politics are talked here, it is far enough\r\n    from the scene of action for them to lose much of their\r\n    personality, and for all the little views to be lost in the\r\n    greater--and yet the interest is as great as in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    EDINBURGH, _January 28_, 1846\r\n\r\n    Well, I wonder what you will say to the debate or rather the\r\n    explanations in Parliament. Are not John's and Sir Robert's\r\n    speeches a curious contrast? and is not John a generous man? and is\r\n    not Sir Robert a puzzling one? and was there ever such a strange\r\n    state of parties? What an unhappy being a real Tory must be, at\r\n    least in England, battling so vainly against time and tide, and\r\n    doomed to see the idols of his worship crumbled to dust one after\r\n    another. In _your_ benighted country [Italy] their end is\r\n    further off; but still it must come. I am reading a book on Russia\r\n    that makes my blood boil at every page. It is called \"Eastern\r\n    Europe and the Emperor Nicholas,\" and I am positively ashamed of\r\n    the reception we gave that wholesale murderer in our free country.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord John to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    CHESHAM PLACE, _February_ 1, 1846\r\n\r\n    The Ministry will carry their Corn Measure, but will hardly last a\r\n    month after it. What next? I think the next Government will be\r\n    Whig, as the Protection party have no corps of officers in the\r\n    House of Commons. So that their only way of avenging themselves\r\n    upon Peel is to bring in a Liberal Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John to Lord John Russell_\r\n\r\n    MINTO, _February_ 7, 1846\r\n\r\n    I am glad you have a satisfactory letter from the doctor. A\r\n    volunteered letter from him, as this was, must be a good sign.... I\r\n    shall all my life regret not having been with you at this most\r\n    interesting period in our political history; for the longest\r\n    letters can but barely make up for the loss of the hourly chats\r\n    upon each event with all its variations which are only known in\r\n    London. Then, I think how sad it is for you to have nobody to care,\r\n    as I should care, whether you had spoken well or ill. But all this\r\n    and much more we must bear as cheerfully as we can; and I am glad\r\n    to think that though _one wife_ is far from you, your other\r\n    wife, the House of Commons, leaves you little time to spend in\r\n    pining for her. I think you quite right in your intention of voting\r\n    for Sir Robert's measure as it is, in preference to any amendment\r\n    which would not be carried, and might delay the settlement of the\r\n    question. Not, as you well know, because I am not heart and soul a\r\n    Free Trader, but because I think it a more patriotic, as well as a\r\n    more consistent, course for you to take. Then if you come into\r\n    office, as seems probable, you may make what improvements you like,\r\n    and especially put an end to the miserable trifling about\r\n    slave-grown sugar; a question in which I take a sentimental\r\n    interest, as your first gift to me was your great sugar speech in\r\n    1841.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord John to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    HOUSE OF COMMONS, _February_ 9, 1846\r\n\r\n    Here I am in the House of Commons, on the important night of Corn,\r\n    having just introduced Morpeth as a new Member. It all makes me\r\n    very nervous--I mean to speak to-night, and I must take care not to\r\n    join in the bitterness of the Tories, and at the same time to avoid\r\n    the praise of the Ministry, which I see is the fashion. ... I am\r\n    glad you all take such interest in the present struggle--it would\r\n    be difficult not to do so. Our majority will, I hope, be eighty. As\r\n    matters stand at present no one feels sure of the Lords.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord John to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    CHESHAM PLACE, _February_ 16, 1846\r\n\r\n    The events of the last few days have been remarkable. There has\r\n    been no move, no agitation in the counties; but wherever a contest\r\n    is announced the Protection party carry it hollow.... In London the\r\n    Protectionists have created in a fortnight a very strong and\r\n    compact party, from 220 to 240, in the Commons, and no one knows\r\n    how many in the Lords--thus we are threatened with a revival of the\r\n    real old Tory party. Of course they are very civil to us, and they\r\n    all say that we ought to have settled this question and not Sir\r\n    Robert. But how things may turn out no one can say.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord John to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    CHESHAM PLACE, _February_ 21, 1846\r\n\r\n    I trust the feelings you have, and the enjoyment you seem to take\r\n    in the flowers and buds of the garden, show that you have before\r\n    you the opening Paradise of good health.\r\n\r\n    Baby's letter is very merry indeed. I long to see his little face\r\n    and curly locks again.\r\n\r\n    I am going to have a meeting at twelve and of twelve on the affairs\r\n    of Ireland. It is a thorny point, and vexes me more than the Corn\r\n    Laws. Lord Bessborough and Lansdowne are too much inclined to\r\n    coercion, and I fear we shall not agree. But on the other hand, if\r\n    we show ourselves for strong measures without lenitives, I fear we\r\n    shall entirely lose the confidence of Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _February_ 22, 1846\r\n\r\n    We are much occupied with the affairs of Ireland--I am engaged in\r\n    persuading Lansdowne to speak out upon the affairs of that unhappy\r\n    country, where a Bill called an Insurrection Act seems the ordinary\r\n    medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John to Lord John Russell_\r\n\r\n    Minto, _February_ 23, 1846\r\n\r\n    You were quite right to send the children out in spite of the\r\n    remains of their coughs, but how hard it is for you to have all\r\n    those domestic responsibilities added to your numerous public ones.\r\n    It is more than your share, while I linger away my hours on the\r\n    sofa, without so much as a dinner to order for anybody. Your\r\n    Coercive measures for Ireland frighten me. I do not trust any\r\n    Englishman on the subject except yourself, and you cannot keep to\r\n    your own opinion in favour of leniency and act upon it. I often\r\n    think how unfortunate it is that there should be that little\r\n    channel of sea between England and Ireland. It prevents each\r\n    country from considering itself a part of the other, and a bridge\r\n    across it would make it much more difficult for Orange or Repeal\r\n    bitterness to be kept up. I send you Lord William's [26] letter.\r\n    But first I must tell you that in a former letter from him he\r\n    compared you to Antony throwing away the world for Cleopatra.... I\r\n    read one of Lord Campbell's Lives aloud yesterday evening--Sir\r\n    Christopher Hatton--a short and entertaining one; but from which it\r\n    would appear that a man can make a respectable Lord Chancellor\r\n    without having seriously studied anything except dancing....\r\n\r\n[26] Lord John Russell's brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord William Russell to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    Genoa, _February_ 12, 1846\r\n\r\n    My dear Sister--I thank you much for your letter of the 4th from\r\n    Minto, but regret to find my letters make you not only angry, but\r\n    very angry. If I was within reach I should have my ears well\r\n    cuffed, but at this distance I am bold.... You will not have to get\r\n    into a towering passion in defending your husband from my\r\n    accusation of loving you too much and dashing the world aside and\r\n    bid it pass, that he might enjoy a quiet life with his Fanny. I\r\n    begin by obeying you and asking pardon and saying you did quite\r\n    right not to think me in earnest, and to \"know that I often write\r\n    what I do not mean,\" a fault unknown to myself, and one to be\r\n    corrected, for it is a great fault, if not worse. The letter just\r\n    received pleases me much, for I find in it a high tone of moral\r\n    rectitude, a noble feeling of devotion to your husband's calling,\r\n    an unselfish determination to fulfil your destiny, an abnegation of\r\n    domestic comfort, a latent feeling of ambition tempered with\r\n    resignation, such as becomes a woman, that do you the highest\r\n    honour.... I think the crisis we are going through in England very\r\n    alarming ... a frightful system of political immorality is\r\n    stalking through the land--the Democracy is triumphant, the\r\n    Aristocracy is making a noble and last effort to hold its own,\r\n    unfortunately in so bad, so unjust, so selfish, so stupid a cause,\r\n    that it must fall covered with shame.... The hero of the day,\r\n    Cobden, is a great man in his way, the type of an honest\r\n    manufacturer, but for the moment all-powerful. I am domiciled with\r\n    your brother and sister, [27] under the same roof, dine daily at\r\n    their hospitable table, sit over the fire and cose and prose with\r\n    them, sometimes alone with your sister, who thinks and talks very\r\n    like you, that is, not only well but very well.\r\n\r\n    I am very affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n    W.R.\r\n\r\n    P.S.--You say it would be unworthy of John to _pine_ for\r\n    office. I think the difficulties of a Prime Minister so great and\r\n    the toil so irksome that the country ought to be full of gratitude\r\n    to any man that will undertake it. I am full of gratitude to Sir\r\n    Robert Peel for having sacrificed his ease and enjoyment for the\r\n    good of his country, and to enable us to sit in the shade under our\r\n    own fig-trees. Glory and gratitude to Peel.\r\n\r\n[27] Lady Mary Abercromby.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord John to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    CHESHAM PLACE, _February_ 15, 1846\r\n\r\n    I have been to St. Paul's to-day. Mr. Bennett enforced still\r\n    further obedience to the Church, and what was strange, he said\r\n    Papists and Dissenters were prevented by the prejudices of\r\n    education from seeing the truth--as if the same thing were not just\r\n    as true of his own Church. I do not see how it is possible to be\r\n    out of the Roman Catholic pale and not use one's own faculties on\r\n    the interpretation of the Bible. That tells us that our Saviour\r\n    said, he who knew that to love God with all our soul and to love\r\n    our neighbour as ourself were the two great commandments, was not\r\n    far from the kingdom of God. This surely can be known and even\r\n    followed without a priest at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John to Lord John Russell_\r\n\r\n    MINTO, _February_ 27, 1846\r\n\r\n    You seem to have had a very pleasant dinner at the Berrys, and I\r\n    wish I had been at it. I wonder sometimes whether the social\r\n    enjoyments of life are for ever at an end for me: and in my hopeful\r\n    moods I plan all sorts of pleasant little _teas_ at Chesham\r\n    Place--at home from nine to eleven on certain days, in an easy way,\r\n    without smart dressing and preparation of any sort beyond a few\r\n    candles and plenty of tea. I feel and always have felt ambitious to\r\n    establish some more popular and rational kind of society than is\r\n    usual in London. But the difficulty in our position would be to\r\n    limit the numbers: however, limiting the hours would help to do\r\n    this; and I do not think one need be very brilliant or agreeable\r\n    oneself to make such a thing succeed well. But what a foolish\r\n    presumptuous being I am, lying here on my sofa, not even able to\r\n    share in the quiet amusements of Minto, making schemes for the\r\n    entertainment of all the London world! However, these dreams and\r\n    others of a more serious nature as to my future life, if God should\r\n    restore me to health, help to while away my hours of separation\r\n    from you, and make me forget for awhile how long I have been\r\n    debarred from fulfilling my natural duties, either to you, the\r\n    children, or the world. This, believe me, is the hardest of the\r\n    many hard trials that belong to illness, or at least, such an\r\n    illness as mine, in which I have mercifully but little physical\r\n    suffering.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    MINTO, _March_ 1, 1846\r\n\r\n    What pleasant times we live in, when the triumph of right\r\n    principles brings about one great and peaceful change after another\r\n    in our country; each one (this from Free Trade in a great degree)\r\n    promising an increase of happiness and diminution of war and\r\n    bloodshed to the whole world. No doubt, however, its good effects\r\n    will be but slowly perceived, and I fear there is much\r\n    disappointment in store for the millions of poor labourers, who\r\n    expect to have abundance of food and clothing the moment the Bill\r\n    becomes a law. Poor creatures, their state is most deplorable and\r\n    haunts me day and night. The very best of Poor Laws must be quite\r\n    insufficient. Indeed, wherever there is a necessity for a Poor Law\r\n    at all there must be something wrong, I think; for if each\r\n    proprietor, farmer and clergyman did his duty there would be no\r\n    misery, and if they do _not_, no Poor Law can prevent it. You\r\n    cannot think how I long for a few acres of _our own_, in order\r\n    to know and do what little I could for the poor round us. It would\r\n    not lessen one's deep pity for the many in all other parts of the\r\n    country, but one's own conscience would be relieved from what,\r\n    rightly or wrongly, I now feel as a weight upon it; and without a\r\n    permanent residence one does not become really acquainted with poor\r\n    people in their prosperity as well as adversity; one only does a\r\n    desultory unsatisfactory sort of good. I have not seen Dickens's\r\n    letter about the ragged schools of which you speak. What you say of\r\n    the devotion of the Roman Catholic priests to the charities of\r\n    religion reflects shame on ours of a purer faith, but is what I\r\n    have always supposed. The Puseyites are most like them in that as\r\n    well as in their mischievous doctrines; but then a new sect is\r\n    always zealous for good as well as for evil.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord John to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    CHESHAM PLACE, _March_ 3, 1846\r\n\r\n    I am so happy to find you have had a good night and are stronger in\r\n    feeling. If you had not told me how weak and ill you have been I\r\n    should have been beyond measure anxious; but, as it is, and with\r\n    your letters, I have been very unhappy and exceedingly\r\n    disappointed. For my hopes are often extravagant, and I love to\r\n    look forward to days of health and happiness and gratitude to God\r\n    for His blessings.... Need I say after all I have suffered on your\r\n    account that while I am conducting my campaign in Italy [28] my\r\n    thoughts are always with you? ... I cannot bear your absence. The\r\n    interest of a great crisis, and the best company of London cannot\r\n    make me tolerably patient under the misfortune of your being away;\r\n    and it is you, and you alone who could inspire me with such deep\r\n    love.\r\n\r\n[28] An allusion to Napoleon's letters to Josephine from Italy, which she\r\nhad been reading.\r\n\r\nPeel had taken the first step towards feeding the poor at home. He had also\r\ndone his best to relieve the immediate distress of Ireland. Shiploads of\r\nIndian corn had been landed, and public works for the help of the destitute\r\nestablished up and down the country. But the chief grievance of the Irish,\r\nwhich was at the bottom of half the agrarian crime, had not been remedied.\r\nThe House of Lords, by having thrown out Peel's Bill for compensating\r\noutgoing tenants for improvements their own money or exertions had created,\r\nwas largely responsible for the violence and sedition now threatening life\r\nand property throughout Ireland. The true remedy having been rejected by\r\nthe Lords, the Government had to meet violence by violence. No sooner had\r\nthe Corn Bill been passed in the House of Commons than Peel brought in a\r\nstringent Sedition Bill for Ireland. Lord John and the Whigs disliked the\r\nBill because it was extremely harsh.\r\n\r\n    _Lady John to Lord John Russell_\r\n\r\n    EDINBURGH, _March_ 12, 1846\r\n\r\n    Nothing that I read in the speeches in favour of the Coercion Bill\r\n    convinced me that it would do the slightest good.... It must\r\n    embitter the Irish against England, for which there is no need.\r\n    Nothing can be more shocking than the continual outrages and\r\n    murders in Ireland; but it is the penalty we pay for a long course\r\n    of misgovernment, and from which nothing but a long course of mild\r\n    and good government can set us free; certainly not severe\r\n    indiscriminate measures which mark out Ireland still more as an\r\n    unhappy conquered province, instead of a part of the nation. Such\r\n    are my sentiments, dearest, on this subject, which always makes my\r\n    blood boil.... I read the \"Giaour\" two nights ago to Addy--it has\r\n    as great and as numerous beauties as any poem Byron ever wrote--but\r\n    I find I am not old enough, or wise enough, or good enough to\r\n    _bear_ Byron, and left off feeling miserable, as he always\r\n    contrives to make one; despair is what he excels in, and he makes\r\n    it such beautiful despair that all sense of right or wrong is\r\n    overwhelmed by it. I said to Addy that one always requires an\r\n    antidote after reading Byron, and that she and I ought instantly to\r\n    go and hem pocket-handkerchiefs, or make a pudding--and that is\r\n    what she has illustrated in the newspaper I send.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord John to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    HOUSE OF COMMONS, _March_, 1846\r\n\r\n    Your views about the Irish Coercion Bill are very natural; but\r\n    Bessborough, who is the best authority we have about Irish matters,\r\n    thinks it will tend to stop crime--and especially the crime of\r\n    murder. I should be loath to throw out a Bill which may have this\r\n    good effect; but I shall move a resolution which will pledge the\r\n    House to measures of remedy and conciliation. This may lead to a\r\n    great debate.... The little girls look very nice, but Toza [29] is,\r\n    if possible, thinner than ever. However, she laughs and dances like\r\n    a little fairy. I dined with Mrs. Drummond yesterday. Macaulay [30]\r\n    was there--entertaining, and not too much of a monopolist--I mean\r\n    of talk--which, like other monopolies, is very disagreeable.\r\n\r\n[29] Victoria.\r\n\r\n[30] Lord John had written to his wife in April, 1845: \"Macaulay\r\nmade one of his splendid speeches again last night.... He is a\r\nwonderful man, and must with the years before him be a great\r\nleader.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John to Lord John Russell_\r\n\r\n    EDINBURGH, _March_ 19, 1846\r\n\r\n    After dinner we drove to Portobello sands and there got out and\r\n    walked for an hour; the sea was of the brightest blue, covered with\r\n    sails; Inchkeith and the opposite coast so clear that every\r\n    inequality of hill or rock was seen; Arthur's Seat, grand and\r\n    snowy, was behind us, and the glittering sands under our feet--the\r\n    whole beautiful far beyond description and beyond what I have yet\r\n    seen it in any weather; for the east wind and bright sun are what\r\n    it requires. How I did wish for you! I need not say that I only\r\n    half enjoyed it, as I only half enjoy anything without you. My\r\n    comfort in your absence is to think that you are not taken from me\r\n    for nothing, but for your country's service; and that even if we\r\n    could have foreseen four years ago all the various anxieties and\r\n    trials that awaited us, we should have married all the same. As it\r\n    was, we knew that ours could not be a life of quiet ease; and it\r\n    was for me to decide whether I was able to face the reverse--and I\r\n    _did_ decide, and I _am_ able--\r\n\r\n      \"Io lo cercai, fui preso\r\n       Dall' alta indole sua, dal suo gran nome;\r\n       Pensai dapprima, oh pensai che incarco\r\n       E l'amor d'un uomo che a gli' altri e sopra!\r\n       Perchè allor correr, solo io nol lasciai\r\n       La sua splendida via, s' io non potea\r\n       Seguire i passi suoi?\"\r\n\r\n    Now I am sure you do not know where those lines are from. They are\r\n    a wee bit altered from Manzoni's \"Carmagnola\"; and they struck me\r\n    so much, when I read them to-day, as applicable to you and me, and\r\n    made me think of your \"splendida via\" and all its results.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John to Lord John Russell_\r\n\r\n    EDINBURGH, _March_ 23, 1846\r\n\r\n    Thanks for your precious letter of Saturday. You need not grieve at\r\n    having brought cares and anxieties ... upon me. You have given me\r\n    a love that repays them all; and such words as you write in that\r\n    letter strengthen me for all that our \"splendida via\" may entail\r\n    upon us, however contrary to my natural tastes or trying to my\r\n    natural feelings. What a delightful hope you give of your getting\r\n    away on the 2nd--but I am too wise to build upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John to Lord John Russell_\r\n\r\n    EDINBURGH, _March_ 25, 1846\r\n\r\n    .... There is a calmness and fairness and _depth_ in\r\n    conversation here which one seldom meets with in London, where\r\n    people are too much taken up by the present to dwell upon the past,\r\n    or look forward to the future--and where consequently passion and\r\n    prejudice are mixed up with most that one hears. Dante, and Milton,\r\n    and Shakespeare, etc., have little chance amid the hubbub of the\r\n    great city--but with all its faults, the great city is the place in\r\n    the world I most wish to see again.... At poor Lady Holland's one\r\n    _did_ hear the sort of conversation I find here, and surely\r\n    you must miss not only her but her house very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord John to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    _April_ 3, 1846\r\n\r\n    At all events pray do not distress yourself with the reflexion that\r\n    you will not be a companion to me during my political trials. You\r\n    have been feeling strong, ... that strength will, I trust, return.\r\n    I see no reason why it should not--and there is no one in existence\r\n    who can think so well with my thoughts and feel so truly with my\r\n    feelings as yourself. So in sickness and in sorrow, so in joy and\r\n    prosperity, we must rely on each other and let no discouraging\r\n    apprehensions shake our courage.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in Parliament the Irish Coercion Bill was dragging on. Lord\r\nBessborough and other Whig peers had changed their mind about its value,\r\nand Lord John, instead of proposing an amendment, definitely opposed it.\r\nThe Protectionists, eager to revenge themselves upon Peel, who, they felt,\r\nhad betrayed them, caught at the opportunity and voted with the Whigs. The\r\nGovernment was defeated by a large majority on the very day the Repeal of\r\nthe Corn Laws passed the House of Lords, and the Queen sent for Lord John,\r\nwho became Prime Minister in July, 1846.\r\n\r\nThis time, beyond the usual troubles in the distribution of offices, he had\r\nno difficulty in forming a Ministry; but when formed it was in an unusually\r\ndifficult position. They were in power only because the Protectionists had\r\nchosen to send Peel about his business, and the Irish problem was growing\r\nmore and more acute. The potato crop of 1846 was even worse than that of\r\n1845, and Peel's system of public works had proved an expensive failure,\r\nmore pauperising than almsgiving. The Irish population fell from eight\r\nmillions to five, and those who survived handed down an intensified hatred\r\nof England, which lives in some of their descendants to this day.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1846 Lord John, little thinking that a home would soon be\r\noffered to him by the Queen, bought a country place, Chorley Wood, near\r\nRickmansworth.\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    CHORLEY WOOD, RICKMANSWORTH, _December_ 12, 1846\r\n\r\n    About the 10th January we all go back to town for good, as John\r\n    must be there some time before the meeting of Parliament. Oh that\r\n    meeting of Parliament! It is so different from any I have ever\r\n    looked forward to; and though it has always been awful, this is so\r\n    much _more_ so. I shall then first really feel that John is\r\n    Minister, and find out the _pains_ of the position, having as\r\n    yet little experience of anything but the pleasures of it. Then\r\n    will come the daily toil beyond his strength, the daily abuse to\r\n    reward him, and the daily trial to us both of hardly meeting for a\r\n    quarter of an hour between breakfast and bedtime. In short, I had\r\n    better not begin to enumerate the evils that await us, as they are\r\n    innumerable. However, I feel very courageous and that they will\r\n    appear trifles if he succeeds; and if he is turned out before the\r\n    end of the session, I shall never regret that he has made the\r\n    attempt. It is a fearful time to have the government in his hands;\r\n    but for that very reason I am glad that _he_ and no other has\r\n    it. The accounts from Ireland are worse and worse, and what with\r\n    the extreme misery of the unfortunate poor and the misbehaviour of\r\n    the gentry, he is made very miserable. As he said this morning, at\r\n    times they almost drive him mad.\r\n\r\nDuring Lady John's long illness in Edinburgh, Francis Lord Jeffrey had been\r\none of her kindest friends, and had helped to brighten many a weary hour by\r\nhis visits and conversation.\r\n\r\n    _Lord Jeffrey to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    EDINBURGH, _December_ 21, 1846\r\n\r\n    It is very good in you to remember my sunset visits to you in the\r\n    hotel. I never pass by its windows in these winter twilights\r\n    without thinking of you, and of the lessons of cheerful magnanimity\r\n    (as well as other things) I used to learn by the side of your\r\n    couch. The Murrays and Rutherfords are particularly well; the\r\n    latter will soon be up among you, and at his post for the opening\r\n    of a campaign of no common interest and anxiety. For my part, I am\r\n    terribly frightened--for the first time, I believe I may say, in my\r\n    life. Lord John, I believe, does not know what fear is! _sans\r\n    peur_ as _sans reproche_. But it would be a comfort to know\r\n    that even he thinks we can get out of the mess in Ireland without\r\n    some dreadful calamity. And how ugly, in fact, do things look all\r\n    round the world!\r\n\r\nOne of the first acts of Lord John's Government was to vote £10,000,000 for\r\nthe relief of Ireland. In July, 1847, Parliament was dissolved. When it met\r\nagain Lord John was reluctantly compelled to ask for its votes in support\r\nof an Irish Bill resembling the one on which the Liberals had defeated Peel\r\nthe year before.\r\n\r\nA bare enumeration of the difficulties which beset the new Prime Minister\r\nbrings home a sense of his unenviable position. Ireland was on the verge of\r\nstarvation and revolt; everywhere in Europe the rebellions which culminated\r\nin 1848 were beginning to stir, seeming then more formidable than they\r\nreally were in their immediate consequences; in England the Chartist\r\nmovement was thought to threaten Crown and Constitution; and, in addition,\r\nthe country had taken alarm at the weakness of its military defences.\r\nLastly, for power to meet all these emergencies Lord John was dependent, at\r\nevery juncture, upon the animosity between the Protectionists and Peelites\r\nproving stronger than the dislike which either party felt for the\r\nGovernment. There were 325 Liberals in the House; the Protectionists\r\nnumbered 226; the Conservative Free Traders 105; so the day Protectionists\r\nand Peelites came to terms would be fatal to the Government. Such were the\r\ntroubles of the Prime Minister, who was a man to take them hard. As for his\r\nwife, her diaries and letters show that, however high her spirit and firm\r\nher principles, her nature was an intensely anxious one.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1846, they both went down for a short holiday to Chorley Wood,\r\nwhere, on the last night of the year, they held a \"grand ball for children\r\nand servants. All very merry. John danced a great deal, and I not a little.\r\nDarling Johnny danced the first country dance, holding his Papa's hand and\r\nmine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n1847-52\r\n\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1847, Lady John wrote in her diary that the year was\r\nbeginning most prosperously for her and those dearest to her. \"Within my\r\nown home all is peace and happiness.\" About a month later she became\r\ndangerously ill in London.\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _February_ 21, 1847\r\n\r\n    I have been very ill since I last wrote.... I felt that life was\r\n    still dear to me for the sake of those I love and of those who\r\n    depend on me.... I saw the look of agony of my dearest husband; I\r\n    thought of my heart's treasure--my darling boy; I thought of my\r\n    other beloved children; I thought of those still earlier loved--my\r\n    dear, dear Papa and Mama, brothers and sisters. But I was calm and\r\n    ready to go, if such should be God's will.... Dr. Rigby has been\r\n    not only the most skilful doctor, but the kindest friend.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of this year, 1847, the Queen offered Pembroke Lodge to the\r\nPrime Minister. He accepted with thankfulness, and throughout life both he\r\nand Lady John felt deep gratitude to the Queen for their beautiful home.\r\n\r\nPembroke Lodge is a long, low, irregular white house on the edge of the\r\nhigh ground which forms the western limit of Richmond Park. Added to and\r\naltered many times, it has no unity of plan, but it has kept a character of\r\nits own, an air of cheerful seclusion and homely eighteenth-century\r\ndignity. On the eastern side it is screened from the road by shrubs and\r\ntrees; on the other side, standing as it does upon the top of the steep,\r\nwooded ridge above the Thames Valley, its windows overlook a thousand\r\nfields, through which the placid river winds, now flowing between flat open\r\nbanks, now past groups of trees, or by gardens where here and there the\r\ncorner of an old brick house shows among cedars. The grounds are long\r\nrather than wide, and comprise the slope towards the valley and the stretch\r\nalong the summit of the ridge, where beech, oak, and chestnut shade with\r\ntheir green and solemn presences a garden of shorn turf and border flowers.\r\nWalking beneath them, you see between their stems part of some slow-sailing\r\ncloud or glimpses of the distant plain; as you descend, the gardens,\r\nvillage, and river near below. There is a peculiar charm in these steep\r\nwoods, where the tops of some trees are level with the eye, while the\r\nbranches of others are overhead. As the paths go down the slope they lose\r\ntheir garden-like trimness among bracken and brambles. An oak fence\r\nseparates the grounds of Pembroke Lodge from the surrounding park.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a perfect home for a statesman. When wearied or troubled with\r\npolitical cares and anxieties, the fresh breezes, the natural beauties, and\r\nthe peace of Pembroke Lodge often helped to bring calm and repose to his\r\nmind. What better prospect can his windows command than the valley of the\r\nThames from Richmond Hill, the view Argyll showed Jeanie Deans, which drew\r\nfrom her the admission \"it was braw rich feeding for the cows,\" though she\r\nherself would as soon have been looking at \"the craigs of Arthur's Seat and\r\nthe sea coming ayont them, as at a' that muckle trees.\" Certainly no home\r\nwas ever more appreciated and loved than Pembroke Lodge, both by Lord and\r\nLady John Russell and their children. Long afterwards Lady John wrote:\r\n\r\n    In March, 1847, the Queen offered him Pembroke Lodge for life, a\r\n    deed for which we have been yearly and daily more grateful. He and\r\n    I were convinced that it added years to his life, and the happiness\r\n    it has given us all cannot be measured. I think it was a year or\r\n    two before the Queen offered us Pembroke Lodge that we came down\r\n    for a few days for a change of air for some of the children to the\r\n    Star and Garter. John and I, in one of our strolls in the park, sat\r\n    under a big oak-tree while the children played round us. We were at\r\n    that time often in perplexity about a country home for the summer\r\n    and autumn, to which we could send them before we ourselves could\r\n    leave London.... From our bench under the oak we looked into the\r\n    grounds of Pembroke Lodge, and we said to one another that would be\r\n    the place for us. When it became ours indeed we often thought of\r\n    this, and the oak has ever since been called the \"Wishing Tree.\"\r\n    [31] ... From the time that Pembroke Lodge became ours we used only\r\n    to keep the children in town from the meeting of Parliament till\r\n    Easter, and settle the younger ones at Pembroke Lodge, and we\r\n    ourselves slept there Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays with as\r\n    much regularity as other engagements allowed. This obliged us to\r\n    give up most dinner engagements in London, and we regretted the\r\n    consequent loss of society. At the same time he always felt the\r\n    need of those evenings and mornings of rest and change and country\r\n    air (besides those welcome and blessed Sundays) after Parliamentary\r\n    and official toil, rather than of heated and crowded rooms and late\r\n    hours; and he had the happy power of throwing off public cares and\r\n    giving his whole heart to the enjoyment of his strolls in the\r\n    garden, walks and rides in the park, and the little interests of\r\n    the children. [32]\r\n\r\n[31] When Pembroke Lodge was offered to them they remembered--with surprise\r\nand delight at its fulfilment--the wish of that day, known to themselves\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n[32] Appendix at end of chapter.\r\n\r\nThe short Whitsuntide holiday was spent in settling in at Pembroke Lodge.\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _October_ 29, 1847\r\n\r\n    ... You would not wonder so much at his [Lord John's] silence\r\n    lately, if you knew what nobody but English Ministers' wives\r\n    _can_ know or conceive, how incessantly either his mind or\r\n    body or both have been at work on financial affairs.\r\n\r\n    He has gone to town every morning early, Sunday included; worked\r\n    hard the whole day in Downing Street, writing long letters and\r\n    seeing one man and one deputation after another, on these most\r\n    difficult and most harassing subjects--only returning here for tea,\r\n    and with no time for any other correspondence but that between tea\r\n    and bed, when a little rest and amusement is almost necessary for\r\n    him--then waking in the night to think of bullion and Exchequer\r\n    Bills till time to get up. Now this great anxiety is partly over;\r\n    for when once he has taken a resolution, after all the reflection\r\n    and consideration he can give to a subject, he feels that he has\r\n    done his best, and awaits its success or failure with comparative\r\n    ease of mind.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of this Ministry have been briefly stated at the close of\r\nthe last chapter; working with a precarious majority, they had to cope with\r\nstarvation and revolt in Ireland, Chartism in England, and disturbances\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1847, they passed their Irish Coercion Bill. [33] The passing\r\nof this Bill was one of the few occasions on which Lady John could not\r\nconvince herself that her husband's policy was the wisest one.\r\n\r\n[33] \"The state of Ireland was chaotic, and Lord Clarendon (Lord\r\nLieutenant) was demanding a stringent measure of coercion. He did not get\r\nit.... The two Bills [Sir Robert Peel's in 1846 and the Bill of 1847] were\r\nso entirely different that to call them by a common name, though perhaps\r\ninevitable, is also inevitably misleading\" (\"History of Modern England,\"\r\nHerbert Paul, vol. i, chap. iv. See also Walpole's \"Life of Lord John\r\nRussell,\" vol. i, chap, xvii.)\r\n\r\nSubsequently, during the enforcement of the Act, the bitterness of the\r\nattacks upon her husband, who, she knew, wished Ireland well, and the sight\r\nof his anxiety, made her for a time less sympathetic with the Irish; but\r\nshe did not, and could not, approve of the Government's action at the time.\r\nAmong Irishmen, a Government which had first opposed a Tory Coercion Bill,\r\nand when in power proposed one themselves, might well excite indignation.\r\nIreland was already in a state so miserable that the horrors of a civil war\r\nwith a bare chance of better things beyond must have seemed well worth\r\nrisking to her people, now the party which had hitherto befriended them had\r\nadopted the policy of their oppressors.\r\n\r\nOn February 26, 1848, the news that Louis Philippe had been deposed reached\r\nthe House of Commons. \"This is what would have happened here,\" said Sir\r\nRobert Peel, \"if these gentlemen [pointing to the Protectionists] had had\r\ntheir way.\" The astonishment was great, and the fear increased that the\r\nChartist movement and Irish troubles would lead to revolution at home.\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause of the revolution in France had been Louis Philippe's\r\nopposition to electoral reform; only one Frenchman in about a hundred and\r\nfifty possessed a vote under his reign. \"Royalty having been packed off in\r\na hackney coach,\" the mildest of Parisian mobs contented itself with\r\nsmashing the King's bust, breaking furniture, and firing at the clock of\r\nthe Tuileries that it might register permanently upon its face the\r\npropitious moment of his departure. He had embarked the next day for\r\nEngland, shaven and in green spectacles, and landed upon our shores under\r\nthe modest pseudonym of \"William Smith.\" England did not welcome him. His\r\nSpanish marriage intrigues had naturally not made him a favourite, and his\r\nenemy, Palmerston, was at the Foreign Office. Two days afterwards Louis\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte left England to pay his respects to the Provisional\r\nGovernment. \"I hasten,\" he wrote in memorable words, \"I hasten from exile\r\nto place myself under the flag of the Republic just proclaimed. Without\r\nother ambition than that of being useful to my country, I announce my\r\narrival to the members of the Provisional Government, and assure them of my\r\ndevotion to the cause which they represent.\" He was, however, courteously\r\nrequested to withdraw from France, since the law banishing the Napoleon\r\nfamily had not yet been repealed, a circumstance which enabled him to\r\nreturn to England in time to enrol himself in the cause of law and order as\r\na special constable at the Chartist meeting.\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _February_ 26, 1848\r\n\r\n    We and everybody much taken up with the startling and in some\r\n    respects terrible events in France. The regency of the Duchess of\r\n    Orleans rejected by the Chambers, or rather by the Côté Gauche, and\r\n    a republic proclaimed. Sad loss of life in Paris--the King and\r\n    Queen fled to Eu--Guizot, it is said, to Brussels. We dined at the\r\n    Palace, and found the Queen and Prince, the Duchess of Kent, Duke\r\n    and Duchess of Saxe Coburg, thinking of course of little else--and\r\n    almost equally _of course_, full of nothing but indignation\r\n    against the French nation and Guizot, nothing but pity for the King\r\n    and Queen and royal family, and nothing but fears for the rest of\r\n    Europe from the infection of such an example. I sat next the Duke\r\n    of Coburg, who more particularly took this _class_ view with\r\n    very little reasoning and a great deal of declamation. Said he\r\n    should not care if Guizot lost his head, and much in the same\r\n    spirit. The Queen spoke with much good sense and good feeling, if\r\n    not with perfect impartiality.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _March_ 3, 1848\r\n\r\n    How anxious you must be as to the effect which the extraordinary\r\n    events in France will have upon Italy. They have been so rapid and\r\n    unexpected that all power of reasoning upon them has been lost in\r\n    wonder. Some pity must inevitably be felt for any man \"fallen from\r\n    his high estate\"; but if, as I trust, the report of Louis\r\n    Philippe's safety and arrival in England is true, his share of it\r\n    will be as small as ever fell to the lot of a King in misfortune;\r\n    for the opinion that he has deserved it is general. It is seldom\r\n    that history gives so distinct a lesson of retribution. You know\r\n    what London is in a ferment of exciting events, and can therefore\r\n    pretty well imagine the constant succession of reports, true and\r\n    false, from hour to hour, the unceasing cries of the newsmen with\r\n    2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th editions of all the newspapers, the running\r\n    about of friends to one another's houses, the continual crossing of\r\n    notes in the streets, each asking the same questions, the hopes and\r\n    fears and the conjectures one hears and utters during the course of\r\n    the day, and the state of blank, weary stupidity to which one is\r\n    reduced by the end of it. What _I_ mind most in it all is the\r\n    immense additional anxiety and responsibility it brings upon my\r\n    poor husband, who feels it even more than he would have done any\r\n    other year from being still, I grieve to say, less strong and well\r\n    owing to his influenza still hanging about him.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Minto_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _March_ 29, 1848\r\n\r\n    John returned to dinner, but some hours later than I expected him,\r\n    which in times like these, when each hour may bring an account of a\r\n    _new_ revolution _somewhere_, or worst of all, of a\r\n    rebellion in Ireland, is a trial to a Minister's wife. However, the\r\n    reason was simply that Prince Albert had detained him talking. ...\r\n    Of course we talked a great deal with our visitors of France,\r\n    Italy, Germany, and Ireland; but happily, engrossing as these\r\n    topics are, the bright sun and blue sky and shining river and\r\n    opening leaves and birds and squirrels _would_ have their\r\n    share of attention, and give some rest to our minds.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _March_ 31, 1848\r\n\r\n    The preparations for rebellion in Ireland are most alarming, and\r\n    John's usually calm and _hopeful_ spirit more nearly fails him\r\n    on that subject than any other. The speeches and writings of the\r\n    Young Ireland leaders are so _extravagantly_ seditious, and so\r\n    grossly false as to the behaviour of England generally, and the\r\n    present Ministry in particular to Ireland, that I cannot but hope\r\n    they may defeat their own objects.... Poor people, the more deeply\r\n    one feels for the starving and destitute millions among them and\r\n    admires their patience and resignation, and the more bitterly one\r\n    resents the misgovernment under which the whole nation suffered for\r\n    hundreds of years, the fruits of which we are now reaping, the less\r\n    one can excuse those reckless ones who are now misleading them, who\r\n    must and _do_ know that the present Ministers have not looked\r\n    on with indifference and let famine and fever rage at will; that\r\n    the subject of Ireland is _not_ one to which the Houses of\r\n    Parliament never give a day's or an hour's thought, but that on the\r\n    contrary, _her_ interests and happiness are daily and nightly\r\n    the object of more intense anxiety and earnest endeavours on the\r\n    part of her rulers than any portion of the Empire. We have had a\r\n    week of such real spring with all its enjoyments, and to-day is so\r\n    much finer and milder than ever, that the notion of streets and\r\n    smoke and noise is odious. However, we have enough to go for,\r\n    private and public. May God prosper the good cause of peace and\r\n    freedom all over Europe.\r\n\r\nThe European revolutionary movement of 1848 did not prove serious in\r\nEngland. What actually took place was a mild mass meeting on Kennington\r\nCommon, well kept within the bounds of decorum by an army of citizen\r\npolice. In Ireland, a rough-and-tumble fight between Smith O'Brien's\r\nfollowers and the police was all that came of the dreaded rebellion. But\r\nbefore these events took place the future looked ominous, especially to\r\nthose responsible for what might happen.\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    _April_ 8, 1848\r\n\r\n    John had a late night in the House, and made two speeches on the\r\n    unpleasant subjects of the Chartist meeting next Monday and Sir\r\n    George Grey's \"Security of the Crown\" Bill; both of which ought to\r\n    do good, from their mild and _whiggish_ tone, in spite of the\r\n    sadly _un_-whiggish nature of the topics; the very, last to\r\n    which one would wish a Whig Government to have to turn its\r\n    attention. All minds are full of next Monday, and at this moment we\r\n    have not a manservant in the house, as they are summoned to a\r\n    meeting to learn their duties as special constables for that day. I\r\n    find it difficult to be in the least frightened, and I trust I am\r\n    right. The only thing I dread is being long without knowing what\r\n    John is about, and as he would be equally unwilling to know nothing\r\n    about me, in case of any march upon this house or any other\r\n    disagreeable demonstration against the Prime Minister, we have\r\n    arranged that I am to go to Downing Street with him in the morning\r\n    and remain all day there, as that is the place he will most easily\r\n    come to from the House of Commons. My spirits have been much\r\n    lowered about the whole thing this morning, as Mr. Trevelyan has\r\n    been here and persuaded John that it would be madness for me either\r\n    to remain in this house or go to Downing Street, both of which\r\n    would be _marks_ in case of a fight.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Trevelyan is very seriously alarmed, and talks of the effect\r\n    the sound of the _cannon_ might have upon me, and has\r\n    persuaded Lady Mary Wood to go to his house on Clapham Common. I do\r\n    not yet know what the other Ministers' wives are going to do, but I\r\n    _do_ know that I think Milton quite right in saying:\r\n\r\n      \"The wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,\r\n      Safest and seemliest by her husband bides.\"\r\n\r\n    However, I must do as I am bid, or at least I must do what makes\r\n    _him_ easiest.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _April_ 9, 1848\r\n\r\n    Hardly knew how much I had been thinking of to-morrow till I had to\r\n    read aloud the prayers for Queen, country, and Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    DOWNING STREET, _Monday_, 3 _o'clock_\r\n\r\n    Well, here we are after all, Lady Grey, Lady Mary Wood, and I, with\r\n    much easier minds than we have had for many days.\r\n\r\n    Everything has ended quietly; the meeting has dispersed at the\r\n    persuasion of its leaders, who took fright. Fergus O'Connor\r\n    especially has shown himself the most abject blusterer, and came\r\n    pale and haggard and almost crying to speak to Sir George Grey--and\r\n    told him how anxious he was that all should come to a peaceable\r\n    end.\r\n\r\n    It seems too good to be true, after the various alarming reports\r\n    and conjectures. Of course there will still be _some_ anxiety\r\n    until the night is well over, and till we see whether the Chartist\r\n    spirit rises again after this failure. To begin at the beginning, I\r\n    ought to tell you that hearing a great clattering at six this\r\n    morning I got up, and looked out, and saw immense numbers of\r\n    Lancers ride from the West into Belgrave Square, which they left to\r\n    go to their destination somewhere about Portland Place, after\r\n    performing many pretty manoeuvres which I did not understand. Many\r\n    foot soldiers passed by. I admired the sight, but silently prayed\r\n    that their services might not be required. We packed the brougham\r\n    full of mattresses and blankets, as it seemed likely that we should\r\n    have to sleep here. Now we have little doubt of getting home.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _April_ 12, 1848\r\n\r\n    Yesterday was chiefly spent in receiving visits and congratulations\r\n    without end, and very welcome they were. John and I had also a good\r\n    long walk to freshen him up for a hard day in the House of\r\n    Commons....\r\n\r\n\r\n    _April_ 13, 1848\r\n\r\n    Again many notes and visits of congratulation and mutual rejoicing\r\n    yesterday. God grant that this triumph of the good cause may have\r\n    some effect on unhappy, misguided Ireland; there is the weight that\r\n    almost crushes John, who opens Lord Clarendon's daily letters with\r\n    an uneasiness not to be told.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell_\r\n\r\n    OSBORNE, _April_ 14, 1848\r\n\r\n    The Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter of yesterday\r\n    evening. She approves that a form of prayer for the present time of\r\n    tumult and trouble be ordered. She concludes it is for _peace_\r\n    and _quiet_ GENERALLY, which indeed we _may well_ pray\r\n    for. A thanksgiving for the failure of any attempts like the\r\n    proposed one last Monday, the Queen would not have thought\r\n    judicious, as being painful and unlike thanksgiving for\r\n    preservation from _foreign war_.\r\n\r\n    Our accounts from Germany yesterday, from different quarters, were\r\n    very distressing and alarming. So much fear of a _total_\r\n    subversion of _all_ existing things. But we must not lose\r\n    courage or hope.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these troubles and forebodings, on the day that the Queen\r\nwrote the above letter to Lord John, their second son, George William\r\nGilbert, was born.\r\n\r\nLady John was touched by the following letter from Dr. James Simpson (the\r\neminent physician, later Sir James Simpson), under whose medical care she\r\nhad been in Edinburgh some years before.\r\n\r\n    EDINBURGH, _March_, 1848\r\n\r\n    I heard from two or three different sources that your Ladyship was\r\n    to be blessed by an addition to your family....\r\n\r\n    I _once_ made a pledge, that I would gladly leave all to watch\r\n    and guard over your safety if you desired me. I have not forgotten\r\n    the pledge, and am ready to redeem it--but not for fee or\r\n    recompense, only for the love and pleasure of being near you at a\r\n    time I could possibly show my gratitude by watching over your\r\n    valued health and life.... With almost all my medical brethren here\r\n    I use chloroform in all cases. None of us, I believe, could now\r\n    feel justified in _not_ relieving pain, when God has bestowed\r\n    upon us the means of relieving it.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _May_ 16, 1848\r\n\r\n    With a thankful heart I begin my diary again. Another child has\r\n    been added to our blessings--another dear little boy. John was with\r\n    me. Oh! his happiness when all was safely over. This child has done\r\n    much already to restore his health and strength. Summer weather and\r\n    the success of all his political measures for the last anxious\r\n    months have also done much.\r\n\r\nBut the Irish troubles were by no means over; on July 21st Lord John\r\nintroduced a Bill for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act in Ireland.\r\nHis case rested on Lord Clarendon's evidence that a rebellion was on the\r\npoint of breaking out, and circumstances seem to have justified this\r\nprecautionary measure. The Bill was passed without opposition and with the\r\nsupport of all the prominent men in Parliament.\r\n\r\n    _July_ 21, 1848\r\n\r\n    Irish news much the same. A Cabinet at which it was determined to\r\n    propose suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. John accordingly gave\r\n    notice of it in the House. I had hoped that a Whig Ministry would\r\n    never be driven to such measures. I had hoped that Ireland would\r\n    remember my husband's rule for ever with gratitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _July_ 28, 1848\r\n\r\n    I have another letter to thank you for. You really must not\r\n    describe the beauties of that place to me any more. It must so\r\n    perfectly satisfy the longing for what, after some years of such a\r\n    life as ours, seems the height of happiness--repose. I struggle\r\n    hard against this longing, but I doubt whether I should do so\r\n    successfully without that blessed Pembroke Lodge, from which I\r\n    always return newly armed for the turmoil. After all, I am much\r\n    more afraid of my husband being overpowered by this longing than\r\n    myself. He can so much seldomer indulge in it. He is so much older,\r\n    and it is so much more difficult for him to portion out his\r\n    employments with any regularity, which is his best preservative\r\n    against _fuss_. Yesterday was a most trying day for him, and\r\n    the more so as he had looked forward to it as one of rest and\r\n    enjoyment. It was Baby's christening-day, and we meant to remain at\r\n    Pembroke Lodge after the ceremony to luncheon; but just as we were\r\n    going to church came a letter from Sir George Grey with news of the\r\n    whole South of Ireland being in rebellion, with horrible additions\r\n    of bloodshed, defection of the troops, etc. As it has, thank God,\r\n    turned out to be a hoax, a most wicked hoax, of some stockjobbing\r\n    or traitorous wretch at Liverpool, I shall not waste your time and\r\n    sympathies by telling you of the anxious hours we spent till seven\r\n    in the evening, when the truth was made out.\r\n\r\n    And now let us trust that real rebellion may not be in store. It is\r\n    dreadful to think of bloodshed, of loss of life, of the desolation\r\n    of one's country and of the many, many imaginable and unimaginable\r\n    miseries of civil war; but one thing I feel would be more dreadful\r\n    still, weak and womanly as I may be in so feeling--to see one's\r\n    husband unable to prevent the miseries, perhaps accusing himself of\r\n    them, and sinking, as I know mine _would_, by degrees under\r\n    his efforts and his regrets. Let us trust and pray, then, that we\r\n    are not doomed to see the reality of so gloomy a picture. It is\r\n    always difficult to me to look forward to great political failures\r\n    and national misfortunes, perhaps because I have never known any;\r\n    but the alarm of yesterday has made them seem more possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _August_ 3, 1848\r\n\r\n    ... I do not care for my country or my husband's success a bit more\r\n    than is good for me, and I often wonder at and almost blame myself\r\n    for not being more disturbed about them.\r\n\r\n    I know that he does his best, and that is all I care very deeply or\r\n    very permanently about; though there may now and then be a more\r\n    than commonly anxious day. If I thought him stupid, or mean, or\r\n    ignorant, or thoughtless, or indifferent in his trade, I should not\r\n    be satisfied with his doing his best even; but as I luckily think\r\n    him the contrary of all these things, I am both satisfied and calm,\r\n    and his own calm mind helps me to be so. Sometimes I think I care\r\n    much more about politics at a distance than when I am mixed up in\r\n    them. The fact is that I care very much for the questions\r\n    themselves, but grow wearied to death of all the details and\r\n    personalities belonging to them, and consequently of the\r\n    conversation of lady politicians, made up as it is of these details\r\n    and personalities. And the more interested I am in the thing\r\n    itself, the more angry I am with the nonsense they talk about it,\r\n    and had rather listen to the most humdrum domestic twaddle. Mind, I\r\n    mean the regular hardened lady politicians who talk of nothing\r\n    else, of whom I could name several, but will not.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _November_ 24, 1848\r\n\r\n    We have just had a visit from Louis Philippe. He spoke much of\r\n    France--said that his wishes were with Louis Bonaparte rather than\r\n    with Cavaignac for the presidency.\r\n\r\n    John expressed some fear of war if Louis Bonaparte should be\r\n    elected; the King said he need have none, that France had neither\r\n    means nor inclination for war. His account of the dismissal of\r\n    Guizot's Ministry was that he said to Guizot \"What's to be\r\n    done?\"--that Guizot gave him three answers: \"Je ne peux pas donner\r\n    la Réforme. Je ne peux pas laisser dissoudre la garde nationale. Je\r\n    ne peux pas laisser tirer les troupes sur la garde nationale.\" Upon\r\n    this he had said to Guizot that he must change his Ministry: \"Cela\r\n    l'a peut-être un peu blessé--ma foi, je n'en sais rien. Il a dit\r\n    que non, que j'étais le maitre.\"\r\n\r\n    When he heard that the National Guard said, if the troops fired on\r\n    the mob, _they_ would fire on the troops, he knew that \"la\r\n    chose était finie,\" and when he went out himself among the National\r\n    Guard, to see what the effect of his presence would be, La\r\n    Moricière called out to him, \"Sire, si vous allez parmi ces gens-là\r\n    je ne réponds pas de votre vie. Ils vont tirer sur vous.\" He\r\n    answered whatever might come of it he would \"parler à ces braves\r\n    gens\"; but they surrounded him, grinning and calling out \"La\r\n    Réforme, nous voulons la Réforme,\" pointing their bayonets at him\r\n    and even over his horse's neck.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    WOBURN ABBEY, _December_ 10, 1848\r\n\r\n    The great question of the French Presidency is decided, whether for\r\n    good or for evil to other countries none can foresee, but certainly\r\n    to the disgrace of their own. For here is a man, known only by a\r\n    foolish attempt to disturb France, to whom no party gives credit\r\n    for either great or good qualities, raised to the highest dignity\r\n    in the new Republic, one of the advantages of which was to be that\r\n    men should rise by their own merits alone. The common language of\r\n    Frenchmen, or at least of French Royalists on the subject, is that\r\n    they consider his election as a step to the restoration of\r\n    Monarchy--but it is a shabby way of making the step, or it may\r\n    prove a false one. You know we have had Louis Philippe and his\r\n    family as near neighbours at the Star and Garter for some weeks,\r\n    and we have seen him several times, to thank us for our inquiries\r\n    after the poor Queen and Princes while they were so ill. Only think\r\n    how strange to see this great King, this busy plotter for the glory\r\n    of his own family and the degradation of England, taking refuge in\r\n    that very England, and sitting in the house of one of those very\r\n    Ministers whom he had been so proud of outwitting, giving the\r\n    history of \"ma chute.\" This he did with great bitterness;\r\n    representing the whole French nation as a mass of place-hunters,\r\n    without patriotism and without gratitude, and with no tenderness to\r\n    Guizot. There is nothing noble and touching in his manner or\r\n    conversation, or I am sure he would have inspired me with more pity\r\n    in his fallen state, in spite of many faults as a King. [34]\r\n\r\n[34] In later years Lord and Lady John had much friendly intercourse with\r\nthe Due d'Aumale, son of Louis Philippe, and with the Comte de Paris and\r\nthe Due de Chartres (grandsons of the King), who were neighbours and\r\nwelcome visitors at Pembroke Lodge.\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier part of 1849, Lord John suffered from the effects of\r\noverwork, and like most tired statesmen he began to think of taking a\r\npeerage. On July 11th their third son, Francis Albert Rollo Russell, was\r\nborn at Pembroke Lodge. The parliamentary recess was an easier period than\r\nthey had known since taking office, and they had time to attend to other\r\nprojects, although the difficulties with Palmerston at the Foreign Office\r\nwere meanwhile coming to a climax.\r\n\r\nIn August Lord and Lady John founded a school at Petersham, over which she\r\nwatched with unflagging interest till her death. They were amused by the\r\nremark of an old gentleman in the neighbourhood, who said that to have a\r\nschool at Petersham \"would ruin the aristocratic character of the\r\nvillage\"--education and aristocracy being evidently, in his eyes, opposing\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nThe classes were held at first in a room in the village; the present\r\nbuilding was not erected till 1852.\r\n\r\nOn August 32nd Lady John wrote in her diary:\r\n\r\n    Our little school, which had long been planned, was opened in a\r\n    room in the village the day before Baby's birthday, July 10th, and\r\n    goes on well. We celebrated John's birthday last Saturday by giving\r\n    the school-children a tea under the cedar, and a dance on the lawn\r\n    afterwards, and very merry they were.\r\n\r\nIn August and September the Prime Minister spent some weeks at Balmoral,\r\nand wrote as follows on his last day there:\r\n\r\n    _Lord John Russell to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    BALMORAL, _September_ 6, 1849\r\n\r\n    I leave this place to-morrow.... No hostess could be more charming\r\n    or more easy than the Queen has been--or more kind and agreeable\r\n    than the Prince, and I shall leave this place with increased\r\n    attachment to them.\r\n\r\nThe Queen had been to Ireland in August, and Lord Dufferin wrote an\r\ninteresting account of her visit in a letter to Lady John.\r\n\r\n    _Lord Dufferin to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    _September_ 10, 1849\r\n\r\n    As the newspaper reporters have already described all, nay more\r\n    than was to be seen on the occasion of the Queen's visit to\r\n    Ireland, I need not trouble you with any of my own experiences\r\n    during those auspicious days--suffice it to say that the people\r\n    were frantic with loyalty and enthusiasm. Indeed, I never witnessed\r\n    so touching a sight as when the Queen from her quarter-deck took\r\n    leave of the Irish people. It was a sweet, calm, silent evening,\r\n    and the sun just setting behind the Wicklow mountains bathed all\r\n    things in golden floods of light. Upon the beach were crowded in\r\n    thousands the screaming bother-headed people, full of love and\r\n    devotion for her, her children, and her house, surging to and fro\r\n    like some horrid sea and asking her to come back quick to them, and\r\n    bidding her God-speed.... It was a beautiful historical picture,\r\n    and one which one thought of for a long time after Queen and ships\r\n    and people had vanished away. I suspect that she too must have\r\n    thought of it that night as she sat upon the deck and sailed away\r\n    into the darkness--and perhaps she wondered as she looked back upon\r\n    the land, which ever has been and still is, the dwelling of so much\r\n    wrong and misery, whether it should be written in history\r\n    hereafter, that in _her_ reign, and under _her_ auspices,\r\n    Ireland first became prosperous and her people contented. Directly\r\n    after the Queen's departure, I started on a little tour round the\r\n    West coast, where I saw such sights as could be seen nowhere else.\r\n    The scenery is beautiful and wild.... But after one has been\r\n    travelling for a little while in the far West one soon loses all\r\n    thought of the scenery, or the climate, or anything else, in\r\n    astonishment at the condition of the people. I do most firmly\r\n    believe that in no other country under the sun are there to be\r\n    found men so wretched in every respect.... All along the West\r\n    coast, from North to South, there has been allowed to accumulate on\r\n    land utterly unable to support them a dense population, the only\r\n    functions of whose lives have been to produce rent and children.\r\n    Generation after generation have grown up in ignorance and misery,\r\n    while those who lived upon the product of their labours have\r\n    laughed and rioted through life as though they had not known that\r\n    from them alone could light and civilization descend upon these\r\n    poor wretches. I had often heard, as every one has, of the evils of\r\n    absenteeism, but till I came and saw its effects I had no notion\r\n    how great a crime it is.... They [the absentee landowners] thought\r\n    only of themselves and their own enjoyments, they left their people\r\n    to grow up and multiply like brute beasts, they stifled in them by\r\n    their tyranny all hope and independence and desire of advancement,\r\n    they made them cowards and liars, and have now left them to die off\r\n    from the face of the earth. Neither can any one living at a\r\n    distance have any notion of the utter absence of all public spirit\r\n    among the upper classes.... Legislation can do nothing when there\r\n    is nothing for it to act upon. Parliament to Ireland is what a\r\n    galvanic battery is to a dead body, and it is in vain to make laws\r\n    when there is no machinery to work them. A people must be worked up\r\n    to a certain point in their dispositions and understandings before\r\n    they can be affected by highly civilized legislation.... It is only\r\n    individual exertions, and the personal superintendence of wise and\r\n    good men, that can ever drill the Irish people into a legislatable\r\n    state.... One or two things, however, seem to me pretty certain--\r\n\r\n    1. That under proper management the Irish peasant can be made\r\n    anything of.\r\n\r\n    2. That, generally speaking, the present class of proprietors must\r\n    and will be swept from off the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\n    3. That in the extreme West the surface is overcrowded, but not at\r\n    all so a few miles inland.\r\n\r\n    4. That reclaiming waste lands and bogs at present is to throw\r\n    money away.\r\n\r\n    I begin to fear I have written a strange rigmarole, but still I\r\n    will send it, for though Irish matters cannot interest you as they\r\n    do me, yet still a letter is always a pleasant thing to receive,\r\n    even only that one may have the satisfaction of looking at the\r\n    Queen's head and breaking the seal.\r\n\r\nThe next entry from Lady John's Diary is dated October 9, 1849.\r\n\r\n    After tea John told me that he had informed the Cabinet of his plan\r\n    for the extension of the suffrage--to be proposed next session. All\r\n    looked grave. Sir Charles Wood and Lord Lansdowne expressed some\r\n    alarm.... To grant an increase of weight to the people of this\r\n    country when revolutions are taking place on all sides, when a\r\n    timid Ministry would rather seek to diminish that which they\r\n    already have, is to show a noble trust in them, of which I believe\r\n    they will nobly prove themselves worthy.\r\n\r\nLord John's determination to carry through this measure himself, rather\r\nthan to leave it in the hands of others, was afterwards the cause of the\r\nfirst defeat of the Whig Government.\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _February_ 19, 1850\r\n\r\n    The weeks are galloping past so much faster even than usual that\r\n    there is no keeping pace with them.\r\n\r\n    I neither read, write, teach, learn, nor do anything--unless indeed\r\n    revising visiting books and writing invitations is to be called\r\n    something. I want to be with my Mama, to be with my husband, to be\r\n    with my children, to be with friends, and to be alone, all at the\r\n    same time. I want to read everything, and to write to everybody,\r\n    and to walk everywhere, in no time at all. And what is the result?\r\n    Why, that I lose the very _power_ not only of _doing_, but\r\n    of _thinking_, to a degree that makes me seriously uneasy and\r\n    unfits me to be a companion to anybody older or wiser than Wee-wee,\r\n    or Baby, whose capacities exactly suit mine. All this sounds as if\r\n    I led a life of bustle, which I do _not_--but it is _too\r\n    full,_ and there is an end of it. I dare say it is mistaken\r\n    vanity to suppose that if it was emptier I should do anything\r\n    worthier of record in the political, literary, or educational\r\n    line--and at all events it would be hard to find a happier or, I\r\n    trust, more thankful heart than mine, my troubles being in fact the\r\n    result of many blessings.\r\n\r\nThe next session opened with the Greek crisis, which Greville described as\r\n\"the worst scrape into which Palmerston has ever got himself and his\r\ncolleagues. The disgust at it here is universal with those who think at all\r\nabout foreign matters: it is past all doubt that it has produced the\r\nstrongest feelings of indignation against this country all over Europe, and\r\nthe Ministers themselves are conscious what a disgraceful figure they cut,\r\nand are ashamed of it.\"\r\n\r\nPalmerston had ordered the blockade of the Piraeus to extort compensation\r\nfrom the Greek Government on behalf of Mr. Finlay (afterwards the historian\r\nof Greece), whose land had been commandeered by the King of Greece for his\r\ngarden, and on behalf of Don Pacifico, a Maltese Jew (and therefore a\r\nBritish subject), whose house had been wrecked by an Athenian mob. The\r\nGreek Government had been prepared to pay Compensation in both cases, but\r\nnot the figure demanded, which turned out, indeed, on investigation, to be\r\nin gross excess of fair compensation. Palmerston's action nearly threw\r\nEurope into war; Russia protested, and France, who had offered to mediate,\r\nwas aggravated by a diplomatic muddle to the verge of breaking off\r\nnegotiations. A vote of censure was passed by the Opposition in the House\r\nof Lords, which had the effect of making Lord John take up the cause of\r\nPalmerston in the Commons. The question was discussed in a famous four\r\ndays' debate. \"It contained,\" says Mr. Herbert Paul, \"the finest of all\r\nLord Palmerston's speeches, the first great speech of Gladstone, the last\r\nspeech of Sir Robert Peel, and the most elaborate of those forensic\r\nharangues, delivered successively at the Bar, in the Senate, and on the\r\nBench, by the accomplished personage best known as Lord Chief Justice\r\nCockburn.\" Lord John, who was always good at a fighting speech, spoke also\r\nwith great force. Mr. Roebuck's motion of confidence in the Ministry was\r\ncarried, but this success was largely due to the fact that a coalition\r\nbetween the Peelites and the Protectionists seemed impossible. Had it not\r\nbeen carried the Whigs would have resigned, and neither of the other two\r\nparties feeling strong enough to succeed them, they did not oppose in force\r\nthe motion of confidence.\r\n\r\nThe day after Peel made his speech he was thrown from his horse on\r\nConstitution Hill, and on July 2nd he died.\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    _June_ 20, 1850\r\n\r\n    ... Day of great political excitement. After dinner I took John to\r\n    the House and have utterly regretted since that I did not go up to\r\n    hear him--for he made what I am quite sure you and Ralph will agree\r\n    with me and all whom I have yet spoken to, was a most perfect\r\n    answer; and I should have dearly liked to hear the volleys of\r\n    cheering which he so well deserved. Now we shall either go out with\r\n    honour or stay in with triumph--welcome either.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord Charles Russell [35] to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    _July_ 13, 1850\r\n\r\n    As you were not here to hear John move the monument [of Sir Robert\r\n    Peel], I must tell you that he succeeded in the opinion of all.\r\n    Dizzy has just, in passing my chair, said, \"Well, Lord John did\r\n    that to perfection. My friends were nervous, I was not; it was a\r\n    difficult subject, but one peculiarly fitted for Lord John. He did\r\n    as I was sure he would, and pleased all those who sit about me.\"\r\n\r\n[35] Lord John's stepbrother.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _July_ 17, 1850\r\n\r\n    For the first time since the session began John spent a whole\r\n    weekday here, and such a fine one that we enjoyed it thoroughly.\r\n    Our roses are still in great beauty, but it is a drying blaze. In\r\n    the evening we cried over \"David Copperfield\" till we were ashamed.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Melgund_\r\n\r\n    MINTO, October 5, 1850\r\n\r\n    This whole morning having been spent fox-hunting, and the afternoon\r\n    doing something else, I do not exactly remember what, I am obliged\r\n    to write to you at the forbidden time (after dinner), instead of\r\n    making myself agreeable. What a quantity I have to say to you, and\r\n    what a pity to say it all by letter, or, rather, to say a very\r\n    small part of it by letter, instead of having you here, as I had\r\n    hoped and looked forward to, enjoying daily _gloomy_ talks\r\n    with you, such as we always find ourselves indulging in when we are\r\n    together.... Though I have scarcely walked a step about the place\r\n    from obedience to doctors, I have driven daily with Mama--and such\r\n    lovely drives! Oh! the place is in such beauty. I think its\r\n    greatest beauty--the trees red, yellow, green, brown, of every\r\n    shade, so that each one is seen separately, and the too great\r\n    thickness on the rocks is less perceived. This was one of the\r\n    brightest mornings, and you know what a hunt is on the rocks when\r\n    the sun shines bright, and the rocks look whiter against a blue\r\n    sky, and men and horses and hounds place themselves in the most\r\n    picturesque positions, and horns and tally-hos echo all round, and\r\n    everybody, except the fox, is in spirits. The gentlemen had no\r\n    sport, but the ladies a great deal, and I saw more foxes than I had\r\n    ever seen before....\r\n\r\n    Our time here is slipping away fearfully fast--there are so many\r\n    impossibilities to be done. I am hungry to see every brother and\r\n    sister comfortably and alone, and hungry to be out all day seeing\r\n    every old spot and old face in the place and village, and hungry to\r\n    be always with Papa and Mama, and hungry to read all the books in\r\n    the library--and none of these hungers can be satisfied. We are all\r\n    much pleased with Mr. Chichester Fortescue. He is agreeable and\r\n    gentlemanlike and good, and Lotty and Harriet got on very well with\r\n    him, which is more than I am doing with my letter, for they are\r\n    singing me out of all my little sense--\"Wha's at the window\" was\r\n    distracting enough, but \"Saw ye the robber\" ten times worse.\r\n\r\nIn September the Papal Bull dividing England into Roman Catholic sees threw\r\nthe country into a state of needless excitement. The year had been a very\r\ncritical one for the Church of England. The result of the Gorham case,\r\nwhich marked the failure of the High Church clergy to get their own way\r\nwithin the Church, hastened the secession to Rome of Manning, James Hope,\r\nand other well-known men. Lord John's letter to the Bishop of Durham, in\r\nwhich he expressed his own strong Protestant and Erastian principles,\r\nincreased his popularity; but it was unfortunate in its effect. It\r\nencouraged the bigoted alarmist outcries which had been started by the\r\nPapal Bull, although his own letter differed in tone from such protests.\r\nThe Ecclesiastical Titles Bill, which the Government brought forward in\r\nresponse to popular feeling, seems to have been one of the idlest measures\r\nthat ever wasted the time of Parliament. It remained a dead-letter from the\r\nday it passed, yet at the time no Minister had a chance of leading the\r\ncountry who was not prepared to support it.\r\n\r\nThe Budget made the Ministry unpopular at the beginning of the session; and\r\nin February Mr. Locke King succeeded in passing, with the help of the\r\nRadicals, a measure for the extension of the franchise, in spite of\r\nopposition from the Government. Lord John had a measure of his own of a\r\nsimilar nature in view, as we have seen; but, in spite of his assurance\r\nthat he would introduce it during the following year, the Radicals voted\r\nagainst him on Mr. King's motion, and on February 20th he resigned.\r\n\r\nThe state of parties was such that no rival coalition was possible. Lord\r\nStanley was for widening the franchise, but being a Protectionist he could\r\nnot work with the Peelites; while Lord Aberdeen would not consent to the\r\nEcclesiastical Titles Bill, and was impossible as a leader so long as the\r\nanti-Catholic hubble-bubble continued. Lord John was therefore compelled to\r\nresume office.\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _November_ 22, 1850\r\n\r\n    I am very glad you and Ralph liked John's letter to the Bishop of\r\n    Durham. It was necessary for him to speak out, and having all his\r\n    life defended the claims of the Roman Catholics to perfect\r\n    toleration and equality of civil rights with the other subjects of\r\n    the Queen, I should hardly have expected that they would take\r\n    offence because he declares himself a Protestant and a despiser of\r\n    the superstitious imitation of Roman Catholic ceremonies by\r\n    clergymen of the Church of England. Such, however, has not been the\r\n    case: and Ireland especially, excited by her priests, has taken\r\n    fire at the whole letter, and most of all at the word \"mummeries.\"\r\n    The wisest and most moderate of them, however, here, and in Ireland\r\n    with Archbishop Murray I hope at their head, will do what they can\r\n    to put out the flame. No amount of dislike to any creed can,\r\n    happily, for a moment shake one's conviction that complete\r\n    toleration to every creed and conviction, and complete charity to\r\n    each one of its professors, is the only right and safe rule--the\r\n    only one which can make consistency in religious matters possible\r\n    at all times and on all occasions. Otherwise it _might_ be\r\n    shaken by the new proofs of the insidious, corrupting,\r\n    anti-truthful nature and effects of the Roman Catholic belief.\r\n\r\n    They have shown themselves for ages past in the character and\r\n    conditions of the countries where it reigns, and now the Pope's\r\n    foolish Bull is the signal for double-dealing and ingratitude among\r\n    his spiritual subjects--and consequently for anger and intolerance\r\n    among Protestants--wrong, but not quite inexcusable.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _November_ 29, 1850\r\n\r\n    Far from wondering at your vacillations of opinion about John's\r\n    letter, both he and I felt, on the first appearance of Wiseman's\r\n    pastoral letter, that the whole scheme was so ridiculous, the\r\n    affectation of power so contemptible, the change of Vicars\r\n    Apostolic into Bishops and Archbishops, so impotent for evil to\r\n    Protestants, while it might possibly be of use to Roman Catholics,\r\n    that ridicule and contempt were the only fit arms for the occasion.\r\n    But when he came to consider the chief cause of the measure--that\r\n    is, the great and growing evil of Tractarianism--of an established\r\n    clergy becoming daily less efficient for the wants of their\r\n    parishioners, and more at variance with the laity and with the\r\n    spirit of the Church to which they outwardly belong; when the whole\r\n    Protestant country showed its anger or fear; when such a man as the\r\n    Bishop of Norwich (Hinds), a man so tolerant as to be called by the\r\n    intolerant a latitudinarian, came to him to represent the necessity\r\n    for some expression of opinion on the part of the Government, and\r\n    the immense evils that would result from the want of such an\r\n    expression; when, after a calm survey of the state of religion\r\n    throughout the country, he thought he saw that it was in his power\r\n    to prevent the ruin of the Church of England, not by assuming\r\n    popular opinions, but merely by openly avowing his own--then, and\r\n    not till then, he wrote his letter--then, and not till then, I felt\r\n    he was right to do so.\r\n\r\n    It has quieted men's fears with regard to the Pope, and directed\r\n    them towards Tractarianism. And we are told that a great many (I\r\n    think one hundred) of the clergy omitted some of their \"mummeries\"\r\n    on the following Sunday. That word was perhaps ill-chosen, and he\r\n    is willing to say so--but I doubt it. Suppose he had omitted it,\r\n    some other would have been laid hold of as offensive to men sincere\r\n    in their opinions, however mistaken he may think them.\r\n\r\n    The letter was a Protestant one, and could not give great\r\n    satisfaction to Roman Catholics, except such as Lord Beaumont, who\r\n    prefers the Queen to the Pope. John has all his life showed himself\r\n    a friend to civil and religious liberty, especially that of the\r\n    Roman Catholics--and would gladly never have been called upon to\r\n    say a word that they could take as an insult to their creed. But it\r\n    was a moment in which he had to choose between a temporary offence\r\n    to a part of their body and the deserved loss of the confidence of\r\n    the Protestant body, to which he heart and soul belongs. He could\r\n    scarcely declare his opinion of the Tractarians, who remain in a\r\n    Church to which they no longer belong, without indirectly giving\r\n    offence to Roman Catholics. But it is against their practices that\r\n    his strong disapprobation is declared, and of the mischief of those\r\n    practices I dare say you have no idea. I believe many of them, most\r\n    of them, to be as pious and excellent men as ever existed; but\r\n    their teaching is not likely to make others as pious and excellent\r\n    as themselves; and their remaining in the Church obliges them to a\r\n    secrecy and hesitation in their teaching that is worse than the\r\n    teaching itself, which would disappear if they became honest\r\n    Dissenters. I could write pages more upon the subject but have no\r\n    time, and I will only beg you not to confound John's letter with\r\n    the bigotry and intolerance of many speeches at many meetings. I am\r\n    keeping the collection of letters, addresses, etc., that he has\r\n    received on the subject--a curious medley, being from all ranks and\r\n    degrees of men, some really touching, some laughable.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _February_ 11, 1851\r\n\r\n    I wonder what you will think of John's speech last Friday. I am\r\n    quite surprised at the approbation it meets with here--not that I\r\n    do not think it deserved, for surely it was a fine high-minded one,\r\n    and at the same time one at no word of which a Roman Catholic, as\r\n    such, could take offence--but so many people thought more ought to\r\n    be done, and so many others that nothing ought to be done, that I\r\n    expected nothing but grumbling. However, the _speech_ is by\r\n    most persons distinguished from the _measure_. I have not yet\r\n    quite succeeded in persuading myself, or being persuaded, that we\r\n    might not have let the whole thing alone; treating an impertinence\r\n    _as_ an impertinence, to be met by ridicule or indignation as\r\n    each person might incline, but not by legislation. This being my\r\n    natural and I hope foolish impulse, I rejoice that the Bill is so\r\n    mild that nobody can consider it as an infringement of the\r\n    principle of religious liberty, but rather a protest against undue\r\n    interference in temporal affairs by Pope, Prelate, or Priest of any\r\n    denomination. Lizzy and I went to the House last night. I never\r\n    heard John speak with more spirit and effect. Do not you in your\r\n    quiet beautiful Nervi look with amazement at the whirl of politics\r\n    and parties in which we live? I am sometimes ashamed of the time I\r\n    consume in writing invitations and other matters connected with\r\n    party-giving--quite as much as John takes to think of speeches,\r\n    which affect the welfare of so many thousands. But after all it is\r\n    a part of the same trade, one which, though most dangerous to all\r\n    that is best in man and woman, may, I trust, be followed in safety\r\n    by those who see the dangers. I am sure I see them. God grant we\r\n    may both escape them.\r\n\r\nIn a letter written to Lady Mary Abercromby, more than two years before,\r\nshe had expressed her feelings with regard to religious ceremonies. It is\r\ninteresting that the word _mummeries_, which excited so much\r\nindignation in Lord John's Durham letter, occurs in this letter.\r\n\r\nOn January 13, 1848, she wrote:\r\n\r\n    Many thanks to you for the interesting account of the great\r\n    ceremony on Christmas Day in St. Peter's, and of your own feelings\r\n    about it. I believe that whatever is _meant_ as an act of\r\n    devotion to God, or as an acknowledgment of His greatness and\r\n    glory, whether expressed by the simple prayer of a Covenanter on\r\n    the hill-side or by the ceremonies of a Catholic priesthood, or\r\n    even by the prostrations of a Mahometan, or by the self-torture of\r\n    a Hindoo, may and ought to inspire us with respect and with a\r\n    devout feeling, at least when the worshippers themselves are pious\r\n    and sincere. Otherwise, indeed, if the _mummery_ is more\r\n    apparent than the solemnity, I do not see how respect can be felt\r\n    by those accustomed to a pure worship, the words and meaning of\r\n    which are clear and applicable to rich and poor, high and low....\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _April_ 11, 1851\r\n\r\n    I wonder what you will do with regard to teaching religion to\r\n    Maillie when she is older. I am daily more and more convinced of\r\n    the folly, or worse than folly, the mischief, of stuffing\r\n    children's heads with doctrines some of which we do not believe\r\n    ourselves (though we may think we do), others which we do not\r\n    understand, while their hearts remain untouched.... Old as Johnny\r\n    is, he does not yet go to church. I see with pain, but cannot help\r\n    seeing, that from the time a child begins to go to church, the\r\n    truth and candour of its religion are apt to suffer.... Oh, how far\r\n    we still are from the religion of Christ! How unwilling to believe\r\n    that God's ways are not our ways, nor His thoughts our thoughts!\r\n    How willing to bring them down to suit not what is divine, but what\r\n    is earthly, in ourselves! Yet, happily, we do not feel or act in\r\n    consistency with all that we repeat as a lesson upon the subject of\r\n    our faith--for man cannot altogether crush the growth of the soul\r\n    given by God--and I trust and believe a better time is coming, when\r\n    freedom of thought and of word will be as common as they are now\r\n    uncommon.\r\n\r\nIn May Lady John writes of a dinner-party in London where she had a long\r\nconversation with the Russian Ambassador (Baron Brunow) on the Governments\r\nof Russia and England; she ended by hoping for a time \"when Russia will be\r\nmore like this country than it is now, to which he answered with a start,\r\nand lifting up his hands, 'God forbid! May I never live to see Russia more\r\nlike this country! God forbid, my dear Lady _Joan!'\"_\r\n\r\nTo follow the events which led to the fall of the Ministry it is necessary\r\nto look abroad. The power of the Whigs in the House of Commons, such as it\r\nwas, was the result of inability of Tories to combine, owing to their\r\ndifferences concerning Free Trade. The strength of Lord John's Ministry in\r\nthe country depended largely upon the foreign policy of Palmerston, who was\r\ndisliked and mistrusted by the Court. While Palmerston was defending his\r\nabrupt, highhanded policy towards Greece in the speech which made him the\r\nhero of the hour, a war was going on between Denmark and\r\nSchleswig-Holstein, in which the Prince Consort himself was much\r\ninterested. It was a question as to whether Schleswig-Holstein should be\r\npermitted to join the German Federation. Holstein was a German fief,\r\nSchleswig was a Danish fief; unfortunately an old law linked them together\r\nin some mysterious fashion, as indissolubly as Siamese twins. Both wanted\r\nto join the Federation. Holstein had a good legal claim to do as it liked\r\nin this respect, Schleswig a bad one; but the law declared that both must\r\nbe under the same government. Prussia interfered on behalf of the duchies;\r\nEngland, Austria, France, and the Baltic Powers joined in declaring that\r\nthe Danish monarchy should not be divided.\r\n\r\nThe Prince Consort had Prussian sympathies, and he therefore disapproved of\r\nthe strong line which Palmerston took up in this matter. It was not only\r\nPalmerston's policy, however, but the independence with which he was\r\naccustomed to carry it out, which annoyed the Court. He was a bad courtier;\r\nhe domineered over princelings and kings abroad, and his behaviour to his\r\nown Sovereign did not in any way resemble Disraeli's. He not only \"never\r\ncontradicted, only sometimes forgot\"; on the contrary, he often omitted to\r\ntell the Queen what he was doing, and consequently she found herself in a\r\nfalse position.\r\n\r\nAt last the following peremptory reproof was addressed to him:\r\n\r\n    _Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell,_ [36]\r\n\r\n    Osborne, _August_ 12, 1850\r\n\r\n    ... The Queen requires, first, that Lord Palmerston will distinctly\r\n    state what he proposes in a given case, in order that the Queen may\r\n    know as distinctly to what she has given her royal sanction;\r\n    secondly, having once given her sanction to a measure, that it be\r\n    not arbitrarily altered or modified by the Minister. Such an act\r\n    she must consider as failing in sincerity towards the Crown, and\r\n    justly to be visited by the exercise of her constitutional right of\r\n    dismissing that Minister. She expects to be kept informed of what\r\n    passes between him and Foreign Ministers before important decisions\r\n    are taken, based upon that intercourse: to receive foreign\r\n    dispatches in good time; and to have the drafts for her approval\r\n    sent to her in sufficient time to make herself acquainted with\r\n    their contents before they must be sent off. The Queen thinks it\r\n    best that Lord John Russell should show this letter to Lord\r\n    Palmerston.\r\n\r\n[36] \"Letters of Queen Victoria,\" vol. ii, chap. xix.\r\n\r\nPalmerston apologized and promised amendment, but he did not resign, nor\r\ndid the Prime Minister request him to do so. His foreign policy had\r\nhitherto vigorously befriended liberty on the Continent, and although the\r\nQueen and Prince Consort never strained the constitutional limits of the\r\nprerogative, these limits are elastic and there was a general feeling among\r\nLiberals that the Court might acquire an overwhelming influence in\r\ndiplomacy, and that certainly at the moment the Prince Consort's sympathies\r\nwere too largely determined by his relationship to foreign royal families.\r\nIt is clear, however, that as long as the Crown is an integral part of the\r\nExecutive, the Sovereign must have the fullest information upon foreign\r\naffairs. Palmerston had gone a great deal too far.\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _March_ 14, 1851\r\n\r\n    We have now heard from you several times since the _crisis_,\r\n    [37] but not since you knew of our reinstatement in place and\r\n    power, toil and trouble.... I should hardly have thought it\r\n    possible that Ralph, hearing constantly from Lord Palmerston, had\r\n    not discovered the change that has come over him since last year,\r\n    when he took his stand and won his victory on the principles that\r\n    became a Whig Minister, of sympathy with the constitutionalists and\r\n    antipathy to the absolutists all over Europe. Ever since that great\r\n    debate he has gradually retreated from those principles.... I am\r\n    not apt to be politically desponding, but the one thing which now\r\n    threatens us is the loss of confidence of the House of Commons and\r\n    the country....\r\n\r\n[37] The defeat of the Government on Mr. Locke King's motion for the\r\nequalization of the county and borough franchise.\r\n\r\nShe was not right, however, in her estimate of the dangers which threatened\r\nthe Ministry; they came from the Foreign Office and the Court, not from the\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\nKossuth, the leader of the Hungarian Revolution, had been received in\r\nEngland with great enthusiasm. He made a series of fiery speeches against\r\nthe Austrian and Russian Governments, urging that in cases in which foreign\r\nPowers interfered with the internal politics of a country, as they had done\r\nin the case of the Revolution in Hungary, outside nations should combine to\r\nprevent it. This was thoroughly in harmony with Palmerston's foreign\r\npolicy. He wished to receive Kossuth at his house, which would have been\r\ntantamount to admitting to a hostile attitude towards Austria and Russia,\r\nwho were nominally our friends. Lord John dissuaded him from doing this;\r\nbut he did receive deputations at the Foreign Office, who spoke of the\r\nEmperors of Austria and Russia as \"odious and detestable assassins.\" The\r\nQueen was extremely angry.\r\n\r\n    Windsor Castle, _November_ 13, 1851\r\n\r\n    The Queen talked long with me about Lord Palmerston and about\r\n    Kossuth.\r\n\r\n    After accusing Lord Palmerston of every kind of fault and folly,\r\n    public and private, she said several times, \"I have the very worst\r\n    opinion of him.\" I secretly agreed with her in much that she said\r\n    of him, but openly defended him when I thought her unjust. I told\r\n    her of his steadiness in friendship and constant kindness in word\r\n    and deed to those he had known in early life, however separated\r\n    from him by time and station. She did not believe it, and said she\r\n    knew him to be quite wanting in feeling. This turned out to mean\r\n    that his political enmities outlasted the good fortune of his\r\n    enemies. She said if he took the part of the revolutionists in some\r\n    countries he ought in all, and that while he pretended great\r\n    compassion for the oppressed Hungarians and Italians, he would not\r\n    care if the Schleswig-Holsteiners were all drowned. I said this was\r\n    too common a failing with us all, etc. I allowed that I wished his\r\n    faults were not laid on John's shoulders, and John's merits given\r\n    to him, as has often been the case--and that it was a pity he\r\n    sometimes used unnecessarily provoking language, but I would not\r\n    grant that England was despised and hated by all other European\r\n    countries.\r\n\r\nThe Kossuth incident was soon followed by a graver one. On December 1,\r\n1851, Louis Napoleon carried out his _coup d'état._ The Ministry\r\ndetermined to maintain a strict neutrality in the matter, and a short\r\ndispatch was sent to Lord Normanby instructing him \"to make no change in\r\nhis relations to the French Government.\" When this dispatch was shown to\r\nthe French Minister, he replied, a little nettled no doubt by the\r\nsuggestion that England considered herself to be stretching a point in\r\nrecognising the Emperor, that he had already heard from their Ambassador in\r\nLondon that Lord Palmerston fully approved of the change. In a later\r\ndispatch to Lord Normanby, which had not been shown either to the Queen or\r\nto the Prime Minister, Palmerston repeated his own opinion. Now this was\r\nprecisely the kind of conduct for which he had been reproved: in\r\nconsequence he was asked to resign. When it came to explanations before\r\nParliament, Palmerston, to the surprise of everybody, made a meek, halting\r\ndefence of his independent conduct. But he bided his time, and when the\r\nGovernment brought in a Militia Bill, intended to quiet the invasion scare\r\nwhich the appearance of another Napoleon on the throne of France had\r\nstarted, he proposed an amendment which they could not accept, and carried\r\nit against them. Lord John Russell resigned and Lord Derby undertook to\r\nform a Government.\r\n\r\nLady John wrote afterwards the following recollections of this crisis:\r\n\r\n    The breach between John and Lord Palmerston was a calamity to the\r\n    country, to the Whig party, and to themselves. And although it had\r\n    for some months been a threatening danger on the horizon, I cannot\r\n    but feel that there was accident in its actual occurrence. Had we\r\n    been in London, or at Pembroke Lodge, and not at Woburn Abbey at\r\n    the time, they would have met and talked over the subjects of their\r\n    difference. Words spoken might have been equally strong, but would\r\n    have been less cutting than words written, and conciliatory\r\n    expressions on John's part would have led the way to promises on\r\n    Lord Palmerston's to avoid committing his colleagues in future, as\r\n    he had done in the case of the coup d'état, and also to avoid any\r\n    needless risk of irritating the Queen by neglect in sending\r\n    dispatches to the Palace. It was characteristic of my husband to\r\n    bear patiently for a long while with difficulties, opposition,\r\n    perplexities, doubts raised by those with whom he acted, listening\r\n    to them with candour and good temper, and only meeting their\r\n    arguments with his own; but, at last, if he failed to convince\r\n    them, to take a sudden resolution--either yielding to them entirely\r\n    or breaking with them altogether--from which nothing could shake\r\n    him, but which, on looking back in after years, did not always seem\r\n    to him the best course. My father, who knew him well, once said to\r\n    me, half in joke and half in earnest: \"Your husband is never so\r\n    determined as when he is in the wrong.\" It was a relief to him to\r\n    have done with hesitation and be resolved on any step which this\r\n    very anxiety to have done with hesitation led him to believe a\r\n    right one at the moment. This habit of mind showed itself in\r\n    private as in public matters, and his children and I were often\r\n    startled by abrupt decisions on home affairs announced very often\r\n    by letter.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the dismissal of Lord Palmerston, there was but Lord\r\nPalmerston himself who found fault. The rest of the Cabinet were unanimous\r\nin approbation. But there was not one of them whose opinions on foreign\r\npolicy were, in John's mind, worth weighing against those of Lord\r\nPalmerston. He and John were always in cordial agreement on the great lines\r\nof foreign policy, so far as I remember, except on Lord Palmerston's\r\nunlucky and unworthy sanction of the _coup d'état_.\r\n\r\nThey two kept up the character of England as the sturdy guardian of her own\r\nrights against other nations and the champion of freedom and independence\r\nabroad. They did so both before and after the breach of 1851, which was\r\nhappily closed in the following year, when they were once more colleagues\r\nin office. On matters of home policy Lord Palmerston remained the Tory he\r\nhad been in his earlier days, and this was the cause of many a trial to\r\nJohn. Indeed, it was a misfortune to him throughout his public career that\r\nhis colleagues almost to a man hung back when he would have gone forward;\r\nand many a time he came home dispirited from a Cabinet at which he had been\r\nalone--or with only the support of my father, who always stood stoutly by\r\nhim while he remained Cabinet Minister--in the wish to bring before\r\nParliament measures worthy of the Whig banner of Civil and Religious\r\nLiberty, Progress and Reform. Nothing could exceed John's patience under\r\nthe criticisms of his colleagues, who were, most of them, also his friends,\r\nsome of them very dear friends--nothing could exceed his readiness to admit\r\nand listen to difference of opinion from them; but it was trying to find\r\nthe difference always in one direction, and that a direction hardly\r\nconsistent with the character of a Whig Ministry.\r\n\r\nThe spirit which pervaded the foreign policy of Lord John Russell is shown\r\nin a letter from him to Queen Victoria dated December 29, 1851 [38]:\r\n\r\n    The grand rule of doing to others as we wish that they should do\r\n    unto us is more applicable than any system of political science.\r\n    The honour of England does not consist in defending every English\r\n    officer or English subject, right or wrong, but in taking care that\r\n    she does not infringe the rules of justice, and that they are not\r\n    infringed against her.\r\n\r\n[38] \"Letters of Queen Victoria,\" vol. ii, chap. xx.\r\n\r\nLord and Lady John often regretted that the duties of political life\r\nprevented them from having fuller intercourse with literary friends. There\r\nare short entries in her diaries mentioning the visits of distinguished men\r\nand women, but she seldom had time to write more than a few words. Her\r\ndiaries--like her letters--were written with marvellous rapidity, and were,\r\nof course, meant for herself alone. In March, 1852, she writes: \"Thackeray\r\ncame to read his 'Sterne' and 'Goldsmith' to us--very interesting quiet\r\nevening.\" And a little later at Pembroke Lodge: \"Dickens came to luncheon\r\nand stayed to dinner. He was very agreeable--and more than agreeable--made\r\nus feel how much he is to be liked.\" Rogers they also saw occasionally, and\r\nthe letter which follows is a reply to an invitation to Pembroke Lodge. The\r\nsecond letter refers to a volume of poems in manuscript, written by Lady\r\nJohn and illustrated by Lord John's stepdaughter, Mrs. Drummond. He had\r\nlent it to Rogers.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR LADY JOHN,--Yes! yes! yes! A thousand thanks to you both! I\r\n    need not say how delighted I shall be to avail myself of your\r\n    kindness. I would rather share a crust with you and Lord John in\r\n    your Paradise then sup in the Apollo with Lucullus\r\n    himself--yes--though Cicero and Pompey were to be of the party.\r\n\r\n    Yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\n    SAMUEL ROGERS\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Samuel Rogers to Lord John Russell_\r\n\r\n    _April_ 15, 1852\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR FRIEND,--How could you entrust me with anything so\r\n    precious, so invaluable, that when I leave it I run back to see if\r\n    it is lost? The work of two kindred minds which nor time nor chance\r\n    could sever, long may it live a monument of all that is beautiful,\r\n    and long may _they_ live to charm and to instruct when I am\r\n    gone and forgotten.\r\n\r\n    Yours ever,\r\n\r\n    S.R.\r\n\r\nThe next entry from Lady John's diary is dated March 14, 1852:\r\n\r\n    Yesterday John read a ballad in _Punch_ giving a very\r\n    unfavourable review of his conduct in dismissing Lord Palmerston,\r\n    in bringing forward Reform--indeed, in almost all he has done in\r\n    office. He felt this more than the attacks of graver and less\r\n    independent papers, and said, \"That's hard upon a man who has\r\n    worked as I have for Reform\"; but the moment of discouragement\r\n    passed away, and he walked up and down the room repeating Milton's\r\n    lines with the spirit and feeling of Milton:\r\n\r\n      \"Yet hate I not a jot of heart or hope,\r\n      But steer right onward.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEMBROKE LODGE\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMy brother and I have here added a few recollections of our old home.\r\n\r\nA.R.\r\n\r\n\r\nPembroke Lodge, an old-fashioned house, long and low, surrounded by thickly\r\nwooded grounds, stood on the ridge of the hill in Richmond Park overlooking\r\nthe Thames Valley and a wide plain beyond. It was approached by a drive\r\nbetween ancient oaks, limes, and evergreens, and at the entrance was a\r\ntwo-roomed thatched cottage, long occupied by a hearty old couple employed\r\non the place, so careful and watchful that an amusing incident occurred one\r\nday when our father and mother were away from home. A lady and gentleman\r\nwho were walking in the Park called at the Lodge, and asked for permission\r\nto walk through the grounds. The old lodge-keeper refused, saying she could\r\nnot give access to strangers during the absence of the family. The lady\r\nthen told her they were friends of Lord and Lady John, but still the old\r\nguardian of the place remained suspicious and obdurate; till, to her\r\nsurprise and discomfiture, it came out that the visitors to whom she had so\r\nsturdily refused admission were no other than Queen Victoria and Prince\r\nAlbert walking incognito in the Park.\r\n\r\nJust outside the Lodge the Crystal Palace on the height of Sydenham could\r\nbe seen glittering in the rays of the setting sun. In front of the house,\r\neastward, were two magnificent poplars, one 100 feet, the other about 96\r\nfeet high, rich and ample in foliage, and most delicately expressive of\r\nevery kind of wind and weather. They could be seen with a telescope from\r\nHindhead, about thirty miles south-west. Grand old oaks, of seven hundred\r\nto a thousand years, grew near the house and made plentiful shade;\r\nsouthwards the grass under them was scarcely visible in May for the\r\nglorious carpet of wild hyacinths, all blue and purple in the chequered\r\nsunlight. Nearly every oak had its name and place in the affection of young\r\nminds. There were also many fine beech-trees in the grounds. On the western\r\nslopes were masses of primroses and violets, also wild strawberries. West\r\nand south, down the hill, was a wilderness, the delight of children,\r\nuntended and unspoiled, where birds of many kinds built their nests, where\r\nsquirrels, rabbits, hedgehogs, weasels, snakes, wood-pigeons, turtle-doves,\r\nowls, and other life of the woods had never been driven out, and where\r\nvisitors hardly ever cared to penetrate. Outside, in Petersham Park, was a\r\npicturesque thatched byre where the cows were milked. Petersham Park was\r\nthen quiet and secluded, before the time came for its invasion by London\r\nschool treats.\r\n\r\nEast of the house was a long lawn, secluded from the open Park by a\r\nbeautiful, wildly growing hedge of gorse, berberis, bramble, hawthorn, and\r\nwild roses. Further north was a bowling-green, surrounded by hollies,\r\nlaburnums, lilacs, rhododendrons, and forest trees; at one end was a\r\nrose-trellis and a raised flower garden. The effect of this bright flower\r\ngarden with its setting of green foliage and flowering shrubs, and majestic\r\nold trees surrounding the whole, was very beautiful. At one end, shaded by\r\ntwo cryptomereas, planted by our father--said by Sir Joseph Hooker to be\r\namong the finest in England--was a long verandah where our mother often sat\r\nin summer with her basket of books, and in winter spread oatmeal for the\r\nbirds, which grew very tame and would eat out of her hand. Close by was a\r\npicturesque old thatched summer-house, covered with roses; on each side\r\nwere glades of chestnut, hornbeam, and lime trees, and looking westward\r\nWindsor Castle could be seen on the far horizon.\r\n\r\nNear the house was a noble cedar, with one particularly fine bough under\r\nthe shade of which the Petersham School children and the \"Old Scholars\" had\r\ntheir tea on festive occasions, followed by merry games in the grounds. The\r\nview from the house and the West walk, and also from King Henry's Mount,\r\nwas most beautiful, especially in the spring and autumn, with the varied\r\nand harmonious tints of the wooded foreground fading away into the soft\r\nblue distance.\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious Park to live in. The great oaks, the hawthorns, the tall\r\ndense bracken, the wide expanses of grass, the herds of red and fallow\r\ndeer, not always undisturbed, made it a paradise for young people. The boys\r\ndelighted in the large ponds, full of old carp and tench, with dace and\r\nroach, perch, gudgeons, eels, tadpoles, sticklebacks, and curious creatures\r\nof the weedy bottom. There was the best of riding over the smooth grass in\r\nthe open sunny expanses or among the quiet and shady glades. Combe Wood, a\r\nlittle south of the Park, was then an island of pure country, quite\r\nunfrequented, and an occasional day there was a treat for all.\r\n\r\nPembroke Lodge, the house, was entered by a porch overhung with wistaria;\r\nthe walls on each side were covered with laburnums and roses; a long\r\ntrellised arch of white roses led to the south lawn, which was sheltered\r\nfrom the east by holly, lilacs, and a very fine crataegus. From here was\r\none of the loveliest views in the place, for our mother had made a wide\r\nopening under the arched bough of a fine elm-tree which stood like a grand\r\nold sentinel in the foreground. The bow room on the south side of the house\r\nwas occupied by our father during his later years. Here stood the statue of\r\nItaly given by grateful Italians and the silver statuette given by the\r\nladies of Bedford in recognition of Reform. The West room next the\r\ndining-room had been our father's study during many of his most strenuous\r\nyears of office. The floor was heaped high with pyramids of despatch-boxes.\r\nOne day some consternation was caused by our pet jackdaw, who had found his\r\nway in and pulled off all the labels, no doubt intending, in mischievous\r\nenjoyment, to tear to shreds despatches of European importance.\r\n\r\nAbove the bow room was our mother's bedroom; the view from here was\r\nexceedingly beautiful, both near and far, and she was never tired of\r\nstanding at the open window looking at the loveliness around her, and\r\nlistening to the happy chorus of birds--and to the nightingales answering\r\neach other, and singing day and night, apparently never weary of trying to\r\ngladden the world with their glorious melody.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed impossible to have a happier or more perfect home; the\r\nfreedom, the outdoor life, the games and fun, in which our father and\r\nmother joined in their rare moments of leisure; the hours of reading and\r\ntalk with them on the high and deep things of life--all this, and much more\r\nthat cannot be expressed, forms a background in the memory of life deeply\r\ntreasured and ineffaceable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n1852-55\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the Russell Ministry had been defeated upon the Militia Bill (\"my\r\ntit-for-tat with John Russell,\" as Palmerston called it), the victors were\r\nvery unlikely to hold office for long. In spite of Disraeli's praise of\r\nFree Trade during the General Election, a right-about surprising and\r\ndisconcerting to his colleagues, the returns left the strength of parties\r\nmuch as they had been before. The Conservatives did not lose ground, but\r\nthey did not gain it; they remained stronger than any other single party,\r\nbut much weaker than Whigs, Peelites, and Irish combined. When Parliament\r\nmet it was obvious that they would soon be replaced in office by some kind\r\nof coalition. Defeat came on Disraeli's Budget. The question remained, who\r\ncould now undertake to amalgamate the various political groups, which,\r\nexcept in Opposition, had shown so little stable cohesion? Since the\r\ndownfall of the Derby Government had been the work of a temporary alliance\r\nbetween Peelites and Whigs, the Queen sent for representatives of both\r\nparties; for Lord Aberdeen as the leader of Peel's followers and for Lord\r\nLansdowne as the representative of the Whigs. Naturally she did not wish to\r\nsummon Palmerston after what had happened; and to have charged Lord John,\r\nthe other Whig leader, with the formation of a Ministry would have widened\r\nthe discrepancies within the Whig party itself; for Lord John was unpopular\r\nwith the Protestant Nonconformist section of the party, who were indignant\r\nwith him for not strictly enforcing the Ecclesiastical Titles Act, and he\r\nhad alienated the numerous believers in Palmerston by having forced him to\r\nresign. Lord Lansdowne was universally respected, and since he belonged to\r\nthe rear-guard of the Whig party there seemed a better chance of his\r\ncoalescing with the Conservatives. When he declined, pleading gout and old\r\nage, the task devolved upon Lord Aberdeen, who accepted the Queen's\r\ncommission knowing that Palmerston was willing to take office and work\r\n_with_, though never again (he said) _under_, [39] Lord John. It\r\nwas most important that both the leaders of the Whig party, Palmerston and\r\nRussell, should come into the Cabinet; for if either stayed outside a\r\ncoalition, which by its Conservative tendencies already excluded Radicals\r\nof influence like Cobden and Bright, it could not have counted upon steady\r\nWhig support. Would Lord John consent to take office? Upon his decision\r\ndepended, in Lord Aberdeen's opinion, the success or failure of the\r\ncoalition. He had some talk with Lord John before accepting the Queen's\r\ncommission, which persuaded him that he could rely upon Lord John's\r\nconsent; but it is clear that at that time Lord John did not consider the\r\nmatter decided.\r\n\r\n[39] Although he asserted at the time that he would never serve under Lord\r\nJohn again, yet it appears that he was the only one of Lord John's\r\ncolleagues who was willing to serve under him, when Lord John attempted to\r\nsucceed Lord Aberdeen. Morley's \"Life of Gladstone,\" vol. i, p. 531.\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _December_ 24, 1852\r\n\r\n    God grant our present good accounts may continue. [Lady Minto had\r\n    been and was then alarmingly ill.] The two last letters have made\r\n    me as little unhappy as is possible, considering how much there is\r\n    still to dread.\r\n\r\n    Whenever my thoughts are not with Mama, they are wearying\r\n    themselves to no purpose in threading the maze of ravelled\r\n    politics, or rather political arrangements, in which we are living.\r\n    Since I have been in _public life_, I never spent a week of\r\n    such painful _public anxiety_. When I say that the possibility\r\n    of John taking office under Lord Aberdeen was always an odious one\r\n    to me, and one which seemed next to an impossibility, don't for one\r\n    moment suppose that I say so on the ground of personal claims and\r\n    personal ambition, which I hold to be as wrong and selfish in\r\n    politics as in everything else. And I shall feel a positive\r\n    pleasure, far above that of seeing him _first,_ in seeing him\r\n    give so undoubted a proof of disinterestedness and patriotism as\r\n    consenting to be _second_, if that were all. But oh, the\r\n    danger of other sacrifices--sacrifices as fatal as that one would\r\n    be honourable to his name--and oh, the infinite shades and grades\r\n    of want of high motives and aims which, at such a time, one is\r\n    doomed to find out in the buzzers who hover round the house--while\r\n    the honest and pure and upright keep away and are silent. At times\r\n    I almost wish I could throw away all that is honest and pure and\r\n    upright, as useless and inconvenient rubbish of which I am half\r\n    ashamed. I never felt more keenly or heavily the immeasurable\r\n    distance between earth and heaven than now, when after the day has\r\n    been spent in listening to the plausibilities of commonplace\r\n    politicians, I open my Bible at night. It is going from darkness\r\n    into light.\r\n\r\n    And now you have had enough of my grumpiness, and I shall only add\r\n    that all has not been pain and mortification. On the contrary, some\r\n    men have come out bright and true as they were sure to do, and have\r\n    shown themselves real friends to John and the country, and redeemed\r\n    the class of politicians from a sweeping condemnation which would\r\n    be most unjust.\r\n\r\nAfter much hesitation Lord John determined to serve under Lord Aberdeen. He\r\nwas persuaded to do so, in spite of strong misgivings, by the Queen, who\r\nwas anxious to avoid the last resort of calling in Palmerston; her request\r\nwas backed by the appeals of his most trusted political friends.\r\n\r\n    _Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell_\r\n\r\n    OSBORNE, _December_ 19, 1852\r\n\r\n    The Queen has to-day charged Lord Aberdeen with the duty of forming\r\n    an Administration, which he has accepted. The Queen thinks the\r\n    moment to have arrived when a popular, efficient, and durable\r\n    Government could be formed by the sincere and united efforts of all\r\n    parties professing Conservative and Liberal opinions. The Queen,\r\n    knowing that this can only be effected by the patriotic sacrifice\r\n    of personal interests and feelings to the public, trusts that Lord\r\n    John Russell will, as far as he is able, give his valuable and\r\n    powerful assistance to the realization of this object.\r\n\r\nLord John's hesitation seems to have been not unnaturally interpreted by\r\nmany contemporaries as the reluctance of an ex-Prime Minister to take a\r\nsubordinate position, and some records of this impression have found their\r\nway into history. We have Lady John's assurance that \"this never for one\r\nmoment weighed with him,\" and that his hesitation was entirely due to \"the\r\nimprobability of agreement in a Cabinet so composed, and therefore the\r\nprobable evil to the country.\" His true feeling was shown by a remark made\r\nat that time by Lady John, that her husband would not mind being \"shoeblack\r\nto Lord Aberdeen\" if it would serve the country. [40]\r\n\r\n[40] Stuart Reid's \"Life of Lord John Russell,\" p. 205.\r\n\r\nIt may be pointed out in corroboration that three years later Lord John was\r\nwilling to serve under Palmerston himself, both in the House of Commons and\r\nthe Cabinet, though the latter had thwarted him at every turn in the\r\nprevious Ministry, and hardly hoped for such generous support. A man in\r\nwhom scruples of pride were strong emotions would have found far greater\r\ncause for standing out then, than at this juncture. Indeed, such an\r\ninterpretation of his motives does not agree with the impression which Lord\r\nJohn's character leaves on the mind. From his reserved speech, shy manner,\r\nand uncommunicative patience under criticism, from the silent abruptness of\r\nhis decisions, his formidable trenchancy in self-defence when openly\r\nattacked, and his aloofness from any attempts to curry favour with the\r\nPress, it may be inferred that his character was a dignified one; but he\r\nwas dignified precisely in the way which makes such actions as taking a\r\nsubordinate political position particularly easy. He foresaw that his\r\nposition would be one of extreme difficulty, but not--here lay his\r\nerror--that it would prove an impossible one. It must be remembered that by\r\nsubordinating himself he was also in a certain measure subordinating his\r\nparty. The Whigs were contributing the majority of votes in the House of\r\nCommons, and they demanded that they should be proportionately powerful in\r\nthe Cabinet. He was therefore forced to arrogate to himself an exceptional\r\nposition in the Cabinet as the leader and representative of what was in\r\nfact a separate party. The Whigs kept complaining that he did not press\r\ntheir claims to office with sufficient importunity, while the Peelites\r\nreproached him with refusing to work under his chief like every other\r\nMinister. Whenever he subordinated the claims of the Whigs for the sake of\r\nworking better with Lord Aberdeen, he laid himself open to charges of\r\nbetraying his followers, and when he pressed their claims, he was accused\r\nof arrogance towards his chief. This, however, was a dilemma, the vexations\r\nof which wore off as places were apportioned and the Ministry got to its\r\nwork; there was a more fatal incongruity in his position. He was\r\ntechnically a subordinate Minister, pledged to reform (as Prime Minister he\r\nhad opposed a Radical Reform Bill on the ground that he would introduce his\r\nown), and the representative of the strongest party, also pledged to\r\nreform, in a coalition Cabinet anxious for the most part to seize the first\r\nexcuse to postpone it indefinitely. In ordinary circumstances, if thwarted\r\nby his colleagues he would have resigned; but as it turned out, their\r\nexcuse for thwarting him was at the same time the strongest claim on his\r\nloyalty. They made Crimean difficulties at once an excuse for postponing\r\nreform and for urging him to postpone his resignation.\r\n\r\nAt first, however, as far as those who were not behind the scenes could\r\nsee, all went smoothly with the Coalition. The work of the session was\r\nadmirably carried out. Lord John entered the Cabinet as Foreign Secretary;\r\nbut as the duties of that office combined with the leadership of the House\r\nof Commons were too much for one man, he resigned, remaining in the Cabinet\r\nwithout office until 1854, when he became Colonial Secretary. The great\r\nevent of the session was Gladstone's famous first Budget.\r\n\r\n    _Lord John to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    _April_ 19, 1853\r\n\r\n    Gladstone's speech was magnificent, and I think his plan will\r\n    do.... I think we shall carry this Budget, as Gladstone has put it\r\n    so clearly that hardly a Liberal can vote with Disraeli to put him\r\n    in our place. It rejoices me to be party to a large plan, and to\r\n    have to do with a man who seeks to benefit the country rather than\r\n    to carry a majority by concessions to fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John to Lord John Russell_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _April_ 20, 1853\r\n\r\n    I am delighted with Gladstone's Budget. I don't pretend to judge of\r\n    all its details, but such of its proposals as I understand are all\r\n    to my mind, and the spirit and temper of the whole speech\r\n    admirable; so bold, so benevolent, so mild, so uncompromising. I\r\n    read it aloud to Lizzy and the girls, and we were in the middle of\r\n    it when your letter came telling us how fine it had been.... Surely\r\n    you will carry it? I feel no fear, except of your allowing it to be\r\n    damaged in the carrying.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. Gladstone to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    _April_, 1853\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR LADY JOHN,--I thank you heartily for your very kind note.\r\n    You know well from your own experience how happy I must be now.\r\n\r\n    We have indeed great reason to be thankful: the approbation of such\r\n    men as your husband is no slight encouragement and no slight\r\n    happiness. I assure you we have felt this deeply. After great\r\n    anxiety one feels more as if in a happy dream than in real life and\r\n    you will not laugh at the relief to me of seeing him well after\r\n    such an effort and after such labour as it has been for weeks....\r\n\r\n    We have often thought of you in your illness and heard of your\r\n    well-doing with sincere pleasure.\r\n\r\n    Once more thanking you, believe me, dear Lady John,\r\n\r\n    Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n    CATHERINE GLADSTONE\r\n\r\n    I must tell you with what comfort and interest I watched Lord\r\n    John's countenance during the speech.\r\n\r\nOn March 28, 1853, Lady John's daughter, Mary Agatha, was born at Pembroke\r\nLodge. Lady Minto was well enough to write a bright and happy letter of\r\ncongratulation on the birth of her granddaughter, but her health was\r\ngradually failing, and on July 21st she died at Nervi, in Italy.\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _August_ 3, 1853\r\n\r\n    The world is changed to me for ever since I last wrote. My dear,\r\n    dear Mama has left it, and I shall never again see that face so\r\n    long and deeply loved. Tuesday, July 26th, was the day we heard.\r\n    Thursday, July 21st, the day her angel spirit was summoned to that\r\n    happy home where tears are wiped from all eyes. I pray to think\r\n    more of her, glorious, happy and at rest, than of ourselves. But it\r\n    is hard, very, very hard to part. O Mama, Mama, I call and you do\r\n    not come. I dream of you, I wake, and you are not there.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord John to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    MINTO, _August_ 10, 1853\r\n\r\n    You will feel a melancholy pang at the date of the place from which\r\n    I write. It is indeed very sorrowful to see Lord Minto and so many\r\n    of his sons and daughters assembled to perform the last duties to\r\n    her who was the life and comfort of them all.... The place is\r\n    looking beautiful, and your mother's garden was never so lovely. It\r\n    is pleasant in all these sorrows and trials to see a family so\r\n    united in affection, and so totally without feelings or objects\r\n    that partake of selfishness or ill-will.\r\n\r\nThe old poet Rogers, who had been attached to Lady John since her earliest\r\ndays in London society, now wrote to her in her sorrow. His note is worth\r\npreserving. He was past his ninetieth year when he wrote, and it reveals a\r\nside of him which is lost sight of in the memoirs of the time, where he\r\nusually appears as saying many neat things, but few kind ones. Mrs. Norton,\r\nin a letter to Hayward, gives an authentic picture of him at this time. She\r\nbegins by saying that no man ever _seemed_ so important who did so\r\nlittle, even said so little:\r\n\r\n    \"His god was Harmony,\" she wrote; \"and over his life Harmony\r\n    presided, sitting on a lukewarm cloud. He was _not_ the 'poet,\r\n    sage, and philosopher' people expected to find he was, but a man in\r\n    whom the tastes (rare fact!) preponderated over the passions; who\r\n    defrayed the expenses of his tastes as other men make outlay for\r\n    the gratification of their passions; all within the limit of\r\n    reason.\r\n\r\n    \"... He was the very embodiment of quiet, from his voice to the\r\n    last harmonious little picture that hung in his hushed room, and a\r\n    curious figure he seemed--an elegant pale watch-tower, showing for\r\n    ever what a quiet port literature and the fine arts might offer, in\r\n    an age of 'progress,' when every one is tossing, struggling,\r\n    wrecking, and foundering on a sea of commercial speculation or\r\n    political adventure; when people fight over pictures, and if a man\r\n    does buy a picture, it is with the burning desire to prove it is a\r\n    Raphael to his yielding enemies, rather than to point it out with a\r\n    slow white finger to his breakfasting friends.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Samuel Rogers to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    _August_ 13, 1853\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR FRIEND,--May I break in upon you to say how much you have\r\n    been in my thoughts for the last fortnight? But I was unwilling to\r\n    interrupt you at such a moment when you must have been so much\r\n    engaged.\r\n\r\n    May He who has made us and alone knows what is best for us support\r\n    you under your great affliction. Again and again have I taken up my\r\n    poor pen, but in vain, and I have only to pray that God may bless\r\n    you and yours wherever you go.\r\n\r\n    Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n    SAMUEL ROGERS\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1853 Lord John took his family up to Roseneath, in\r\nScotland, which had been lent them by the Duke of Argyll. They had been\r\nthere some weeks, occasionally making short cruises in the _Seamew_,\r\nwhich the Commission of Inland Revenue had placed at their disposal, when\r\nthreatening complications in the East compelled Lord John to return to\r\nLondon. The peace of thirty-eight years was nearly at an end.\r\n\r\n    ROSENEATH, _September_ 2, 1853\r\n\r\n    My poor dear John set off to London, to his and my great\r\n    disappointment. The refusal of the Porte to agree to the Note\r\n    accepted by the Emperor makes the journey necessary.\r\n\r\nLady John soon followed him.\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Elizabeth Romilly_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _October_ 21, 1853\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST LIZZY,--... I have never ceased rejoicing at my sudden\r\n    flight from Roseneath, though its two causes, John's cold and the\r\n    Czar's misdeeds, are unpleasant enough--but his presence here is so\r\n    necessary, so terribly necessary, that neither he nor I could have\r\n    stayed on in peace at Roseneath.... What he has accomplished is a\r\n    wonder; and I hope that some day somehow everybody will know\r\n    everything, and wonder at his patience and firmness and\r\n    unselfishness, as I do.... I trust we may be very quiet here for\r\n    some time, and then one must gather courage for London and the\r\n    battle of life again. Our quiet here will not be without\r\n    interruption, for there will be early in November a week or so of\r\n    Cabinets, for which we shall go to town, and at the end of November\r\n    Parliament may be obliged to meet....\r\n\r\n    Your ever affectionate sister,\r\n\r\n    FANNY RUSSELL\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John to Lord John Russell_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _December_ 9, 1853\r\n\r\n    Your letter just come, dearest ... I don't think I am tired by\r\n    colds, but indeed it is true that I think constantly and uneasily\r\n    of your political position, _never, never_, as to whether this\r\n    or that course will place you highest in the world's estimation. I\r\n    am sure you know all I care about is that you should do what is\r\n    most right in the sight of God.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to remind the reader at this point of the diplomatic\r\nconfusions and difficulties which led to the Crimean War. The Eastern\r\nQuestion originally grew out of a quarrel between France and Russia\r\nconcerning the possession of certain holy places in Palestine; both the\r\nLatin and the Greek Church wanted to control them. The Sultan had offered\r\nto mediate, but neither party had been satisfied by his intervention. In\r\nthe beginning of 1853 it became known in England that the Czar was looking\r\nforward to the collapse of Turkey, and that he had actually proposed to the\r\nEnglish Ambassador that we should take Crete and Greece, while he took the\r\nEuropean provinces of Turkey. In Russia, hostility to Turkey rose partly\r\nfrom sympathy with the Greek Church, which was persecuted in Turkey, and\r\npartly from the desire to possess an outlet into the Mediterranean. The\r\nEnglish Ministers naturally would have nothing to do with the Czar's\r\nproposal to partition Turkey. Russia's attitude towards Turkey was\r\nattributed to the aggressive motive alone. Nicholas then demanded from the\r\nSultan the right of protecting the Sultan's Christian subjects himself, and\r\nwhen this was refused, he occupied Moldavia and Wallachia with his troops.\r\nEngland's reply was to send a fleet up the Dardanelles.\r\n\r\nA consultation of the four great Powers, England, France, Austria, and\r\nPrussia, for the prevention of war, ended in the dispatch of the \"Vienna\r\nNote,\" which contained the stipulation that the Sultan should protect in\r\nfuture all Christians of the Greek Church in his kingdom. The Czar accepted\r\nthe terms of the Note, but the Sultan, instigated by Sir Stratford Canning,\r\nthe British Ambassador at Constantinople, refused them. The Czar then\r\ndeclared war, and though the Turks were successful on the Danube, he\r\nsucceeded in destroying the Turkish fleet at Sinope. This success produced\r\nthe greatest indignation in England and France, and in March, 1854, they\r\ndeclared war upon Russia together.\r\n\r\nBefore these events Palmerston had resigned on the ground that the attitude\r\nof the Government towards Russia was not sufficiently stiff and peremptory;\r\nfor, from the first, Lord Aberdeen had never contemplated the possibility\r\nof war with Russia. But before the month was out Palmerston had resumed\r\noffice. It will be seen from the following letter, written by Lord John's\r\nprivate secretary, Mr. Boileau, that disapproval of the Government's\r\nnegotiations with Russia was not the only motive attributed by Whigs to\r\nPalmerston in resigning. Lord John had joined the Ministry on the condition\r\nthat he should bring forward his measure of reform; from the first most of\r\nhis colleagues were very lukewarm towards it, but Palmerston was\r\ndefinitely, though covertly, antagonistic,\r\n\r\n    _Mr. John Boileau to Lady Melgund_\r\n\r\n    FOREIGN OFFICE, _December_ 19, 1853\r\n\r\n    You will be glad to know something about Pam's resignation and the\r\n    _on dits_ here--if, as I hope, you are safely arrived at\r\n    Minto.... His own paper, the _Morning Post_, will do him more\r\n    harm than good, I think. It will not allow that Reform has anything\r\n    to do with his resignation--swears he is an out-and-out\r\n    Reformer--and that his differing from the policy of the Cabinet on\r\n    the Eastern Question is the only reason. Now this, in my humble\r\n    judgment, I believe not to be the case. I feel certain, in fact I\r\n    feel sure, that he goes out solely on the question of Reform,\r\n    having been opposed to it _in toto_ from the first moment of\r\n    the discussion on it in the Cabinet, and though he went on with\r\n    them for a time, they came to something that he could not swallow.\r\n    As to the question of the East, if he does differ from the Cabinet\r\n    it is no more than Lord John or several others might say if they\r\n    went out to-morrow.... The _Times_ of to-day has a very severe\r\n    article against him. The _Daily News_ is very sensible and\r\n    implies great confidence in Lord John. The _Chronicle_ is calm\r\n    in its disapprobation of Pam--the _Morning Advertiser_, of all\r\n    papers! is the most in favour, and is crying Pam up for Prime\r\n    Minister already, and gives extracts from county papers to show how\r\n    popular he is. The _Morning Herald_ is silent on the subject.\r\n    I send you these flying remarks, as I dare say you will see nothing\r\n    at Minto except perhaps the _Times_, and any news in the\r\n    country goes a great way.... London is very cold and painfully dull\r\n    without 24 Chester Square, and you must write to me very often. You\r\n    see _I_ have begun very well....\r\n\r\nLord John, however, insisted on bringing forward his Bill in spite of\r\nopposition from his colleagues and many of the Government's supporters. He\r\nfelt that the party was bound to keep its promise to the country, while his\r\ncolleagues urged that the House of Commons was so much occupied by the war\r\nthat they had no time to consider such a Bill. As the House of Commons was\r\nnot conducting the war itself the excuse was shallow. Lord John threatened\r\nto resign unless he was allowed to introduce his measure, for he considered\r\nthe honour of the Ministry and his own honour at stake. From the following\r\nletters it will be seen how hard he fought for this measure, and with what\r\npoignant regret he found himself compelled at last to choose between\r\nletting it drop and resignation. His resignation would have meant a serious\r\nshock to a Ministry already in disgrace through their mismanagement of the\r\nwar; rather than embarrass them further at such a crisis he chose the\r\nlesser evil of abandoning his Bill. But by yielding to the urgent appeals\r\nof his colleagues and continuing in office, his position became from day to\r\nday increasingly difficult. Finally, he resigned abruptly, for reasons\r\nwhich have been interpreted unfavourably by almost every historian who has\r\nwritten upon this period.\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _February_ 14, 1854\r\n\r\n    I remember almost crying in Minto days, when you were twelve,\r\n    because I thought it past the prime of life. What shall I do now\r\n    that you are striking forty-three? I believe you have long ago made\r\n    up your mind to the changing and fading and ending of all things\r\n    here below, joys as well as sorrows, childhood, youth and age, hope\r\n    and fear and doubt, and that you have learnt to look forward rather\r\n    than back; but to me this is often a struggle still; and when the\r\n    struggle ends the wrong way, how much there is to make my heart\r\n    sink within me! Chiefly, as you may guess, the deepening lines on\r\n    the face of the dearest husband that ever blessed a home, and the\r\n    comparison of him as he now is with him as he was when we married.\r\n\r\n    Yesterday was a great day to us; the Reform Bill was brought in. I\r\n    suppose I should be better pleased if there was more enthusiasm. I\r\n    should certainly have a better opinion of human nature, if those\r\n    who have cried out most loudly for Reform did not set their\r\n    cowardly faces against it now; but at the same time there is a\r\n    happy pride in seeing John's honest and patriotic perseverance in\r\n    what he is convinced is right, through evil report and good report,\r\n    in season and out of season.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Elizabeth Romilly_\r\n\r\n    _February_ 28, 1854\r\n\r\n    DEAREST LIZZY,--To get out of my difficulty as to which of my other\r\n    three correspondents to write to, I give my half-hour to you this\r\n    morning. I must begin by thanking you all with all my heart for\r\n    your most welcome congratulations on all that John has said and\r\n    done since Parliament met, and especially his great speech in\r\n    answer to Layard. It is indeed a happiness to hear such praise from\r\n    people whose praise is worth having; but I have now learned, if I\r\n    had not long ago, how worthless many of the congratulations are,\r\n    which I receive after a good speech which has set the Ministers\r\n    firmer in their seats. It may be right the week after to make one\r\n    which has a contrary effect, and then the congratulators become\r\n    revilers. I knew when I began to write that I should be\r\n    disagreeable, but had hoped not to be so as early as the second\r\n    page. However, having got into the complaining mood, I will not\r\n    hurry out of it; and I shall be surprised if you do not admit that\r\n    I have some reason for my complaints.\r\n\r\n    For the last ten days John has been urged and pressed and\r\n    threatened and coaxed and assailed by all the various arts of every\r\n    variety of politician to induce him to give up Reform! Mind,\r\n    _I_ say give up, where _they_ say put off, because I know\r\n    they mean give up; though cowards as they are in this as in\r\n    everything else, they _dare_ not say what they mean. Will you\r\n    believe that the language poured into my pained and wounded and\r\n    offended but very helpless ears, day after day, by official\r\n    friends, is to the effect that the country is apathetic on Reform,\r\n    and that therefore it should not be proceeded with; that Reform is\r\n    a measure calculated to produce excitement, conflict, disturbance\r\n    in the country, and therefore it should not be proceeded with; that\r\n    John having given a pledge was bound, \"oh yes, certainly,\" to\r\n    redeem it, and that all the world will agree he _has_ most\r\n    nobly redeemed it, if he lets his Bill fall on the floor of the\r\n    House of Commons to-morrow, never to be picked up again; that if he\r\n    proceeds with it, he will be universally reproached for allowing\r\n    personal hostility to Lord Palmerston to influence him to the\r\n    injury of the country; that his character is so high that if he\r\n    gave it up, it would be utterly impossible for any creature to\r\n    raise a doubt of his sincerity in bringing it forward; that\r\n    dissolution or resignation are revolution and ruin and disgrace;\r\n    that the caballers are wrong, quite wrong, but that we must look at\r\n    the general question and the possible results (a hackneyed\r\n    expression which may sound wise but of which I too well know the\r\n    drift); that it may often be very honourable to abandon friends and\r\n    supporters with whom we agree, to conciliate the shabbies with whom\r\n    we differ; that, of course, they would be too happy to be out of\r\n    office, but people must not consult their own wishes; that I must\r\n    be aware that Lord John is supposed sometimes to be a little\r\n    obstinate, etc. In short, it all comes to this, that many M.P.'s\r\n    are afraid of losing their seats by a dissolution, and many others\r\n    whose boroughs are disfranchised hate the Reform Bill, and many\r\n    more are anti-Reformers by nature, and all these combine to stifle\r\n    it.... And to tell Lord John that really he has such a quantity of\r\n    spare character that it can bear a little damaging! I am ashamed\r\n    and sick of such things, and should think my country no longer\r\n    worth caring for, but for those brave men who have gone off to\r\n    fight for her with a spirit worthy of themselves, and but for those\r\n    lower classes in which Frederick [41] tells me to put my faith....\r\n    I must stop, not without fear that you may think me blind to the\r\n    very real evil and danger of dissolution or resignation at the\r\n    beginning of a great war. Indeed I am not--but those who see\r\n    nothing but these dangers are taking the very way to lead us into\r\n    them.... Lord Aberdeen is firm as a rock; it is due to him to say\r\n    so. How shall I prevent my boys growing up to be cowards and\r\n    selfish like the rest? You see what a humour I am in.... I never\r\n    _let out_ to anybody. When my friends give all this noble\r\n    advice I sit to all appearance like Patience on a monument, but not\r\n    feeling like her at all--keeping silence because there is not time\r\n    to begin at the first rudiments of morality, and there would be no\r\n    use in anything higher up. Good-bye, poor Lizzy, doomed to suffer\r\n    under my bad moods. God bless you all.\r\n\r\n    Yours ever, F.R.\r\n\r\n[41] Colonel Romilly, husband of Lady Elizabeth Romilly, and son of\r\nSir Samuel Romilly.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord Granville to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    _February_ 28, 1854\r\n\r\n    I have just heard that Lord John has consented to put off Reform\r\n    till after Easter. It must have been a great personal sacrifice to\r\n    him, but I am delighted for his own sake and the public cause that\r\n    he has done it. There is no doubt but that nearly all who cry for\r\n    delay are at bottom enemies to Reform. Reform is not incompatible\r\n    with war, and it is not clear that a dissolution would be dangerous\r\n    during its continuance, but an enormous majority of the House of\r\n    Commons have persuaded themselves of the contrary.\r\n\r\n    In all probability the apathetic approved of the Reform Bill only\r\n    because it was out of the question for the present. Newcastle\r\n    agrees with me in thinking that a wall has been built which, at\r\n    present, could not have been knocked down by the few who really\r\n    desire Reform.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _April_ 8, 1854\r\n\r\n    Painfully anxious day. Cabinet to decide on Reform or no Reform\r\n    this session.\r\n\r\n    Came here early with the children, wishing to be cheerful for\r\n    John's sake, and knowing how much power Pembroke Lodge and the\r\n    children have to make me so. Found this place most lovely; the day\r\n    warm and bright as June; the children like larks escaped from a\r\n    cage. At half-past seven John came looking worn and sad--no Reform,\r\n    and no resignation! Not a man in the Cabinet agreed with him that\r\n    it would be best to go on with Reform; though several would have\r\n    consented had he insisted, but he did not. Not one would hear\r\n    either of his resignation or of Lord Palmerston's. In short--the\r\n    present Ministry at any price. John dissatisfied with his\r\n    colleagues, and worse with himself. May God watch over him and\r\n    guide him.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _April_ 11, 1854\r\n\r\n    The great day is over, and thank God John has stood the trial, and\r\n    even risen, I believe, in the estimation of his followers and of\r\n    men in general. The regrets, disapprobation, despair, reproaches\r\n    that assailed him from the various sections of his party, on the\r\n    rumours of his resignation, were of a kind that would have made it\r\n    wrong in him to persist; for they proved that the heartiest\r\n    reformers were against it, and would uphold him in remaining in the\r\n    Government.\r\n\r\n    There was deep silence when he rose. It was soon plain that the\r\n    disposition of his supporters was good; and throughout his noble,\r\n    simple, generous, touching speech he was loudly cheered by them,\r\n    and often by all sides.\r\n\r\n    At the close there were a few words about his own position: he said\r\n    that the course he was taking was open to suspicion from those who\r\n    supported him--that if he had done anything--Here his voice failed\r\n    him, and there burst forth the most deafening cheers from all parts\r\n    of the House, which lasted for a minute or two, till he was able to\r\n    go on. If he had done anything for the cause of Reform he still\r\n    hoped for their confidence. If not, his influence would be weakened\r\n    and destroyed, and he could no longer lead them. This was the\r\n    substance--not the words. It was a great night for him. He risked\r\n    more than perhaps ought to be risked, but he has lost nothing, I\r\n    trust and believe, and I hope he has gained more than the\r\n    enthusiasm of a day. May God ever guide and bless him.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Mr. George Moffatt, M.P., to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    103 EATON SQUARE, _April_ 12, 1854\r\n\r\n    DEAR LADY JOHN RUSSELL,--Pardon my saying one word upon the\r\n    touching event of last evening. A parliamentary experience of nine\r\n    years has never shown me so striking an instance of respectful\r\n    homage and cordial sympathy as was then elicited. I know that the\r\n    unbidden tears gushed to my cheeks, and looking round I could see\r\n    scores of other careless, worldly men struck by the same\r\n    emotion--and even the Speaker (as he subsequently admitted to me)\r\n    was affected in precisely the same manner. The German-toy face of\r\n    the Caucasian was of course as immovable as usual, but Mr. Walpole\r\n    wept outright. I sincerely trust that the kindly enthusiasm of this\r\n    moment may have in some measure compensated for the vexations and\r\n    annoyances of the last two months.\r\n\r\n    Believe me, your faithful servant,\r\n\r\n    GEO. MOFFATT\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Mr. John Boileau to Lady Melgund_\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _April_ 12, 1854\r\n\r\n    I wish I could write you a long letter giving an account of last\r\n    night in the House of Commons.... I would not have missed last\r\n    night for the world. It was a melancholy instance of what a public\r\n    servant in these days may have to go through, at the same time such\r\n    a noble example of patriotism and self-sacrifice as I believe there\r\n    is not another man in England capable of giving--and though I\r\n    cannot yet resign my feeling that it would have been better in the\r\n    end both for Lord John and the Liberal party had he resigned, at\r\n    present I have nothing to do but to admire, love, and respect more\r\n    than ever the man who could, for the sake of his country and what\r\n    he believes in his judgment to be the best for her, go through as\r\n    painful a struggle as he has.... The scene in the House itself I\r\n    shall never forget--the sudden pause when he began to speak of\r\n    himself and his position--the sobs, and finally the burst of tears,\r\n    and the almost ineffectual attempt to finish the remaining\r\n    sentences, and at last obliged to give it up and sit down exhausted\r\n    with the protracted struggle and the strain of nerve. He was loudly\r\n    cheered from both sides of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord John Russell to Mr. John Abel Smith_ [42]\r\n\r\n    _April_ 12, 1854\r\n\r\n    DEAR SMITH,--As I find some rumours have been mentioned to Lady\r\n    John, false in themselves and injurious to me, I beg to assure you\r\n    that it has been the greatest comfort to me to find that I received\r\n    from her the best encouragement and support in the course which I\r\n    ultimately adopted. She could not fail to perceive and to\r\n    sympathize in the deep distress which the prospect of abandoning\r\n    the Reform Bill caused me, and it was my chief consolation during a\r\n    trying period to find at home regard for my fame and reputation as\r\n    a sincere and earnest reformer. That regard has now been shown by\r\n    the House of Commons generally, but there is no man in that House\r\n    on whose friendship I more confidently rely, and with good reason,\r\n    than yourself.\r\n\r\n    Yours ever truly,\r\n\r\n    J. RUSSELL\r\n\r\n[42] Lord John's election agent.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord Spencer to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    LEAMINGTON, _April_ 14, 1854\r\n\r\n    DEAR LADY JOHN,--I cannot resist giving you the trouble to read a\r\n    few lines from me on Lord John's speech the other night.\r\n    Remembering the conversation we had on the subject of the proposed\r\n    Reform Bill, when I ventured, perhaps too boldly and too roundly,\r\n    to let out my unworthy opinion in a contrary sense, I think I ought\r\n    to tell you that I had arrived some time ago at the same conclusion\r\n    which Lord John announced to the House of Commons the other night,\r\n    and I really believe if I had not, his reasons would have made me.\r\n    I never read a more convincing speech, and I never read so\r\n    affecting a one. No man living, I believe, could have made that\r\n    speech but your husband, and it gives me great pleasure to offer\r\n    you my heartfelt congratulations upon it.... Pray forgive me, dear\r\n    Lady John, for intruding thus on your time, and believe me,\r\n\r\n    Very faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n    SPENCER\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lord Minto_,\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _April_ 24, 1854\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST PAPA,--... I must dash at once into my subject, having\r\n    only a quarter of an hour to spend on it. It is that of John's\r\n    position; he has, I believe, raised his character in the country by\r\n    the withdrawal of the Reform Bill. His motives are above suspicion\r\n    and unsuspected; whereas, owing to the singular state of the public\r\n    mind, it seems pretty sure that they _would_ have been, though\r\n    most unjustly, suspected, had he persisted in his resignation. But\r\n    in the Cabinet I do _not_ think his position improved, rather\r\n    the reverse. The policy of the timid and the shabby and the\r\n    ambitious and the cunning and the illiberal triumphed; and all\r\n    experience teaches me that John, having made a great sacrifice,\r\n    will be expected to make every other that _apparent\r\n    expediency_ may induce his colleagues to require. He will always\r\n    be pressed and urged and taunted with obstinacy, etc., and told\r\n    that he will ruin his reputation, if for the sake of one question\r\n    on which he may happen to differ with them, he exposed his country\r\n    to the awful danger of a change of Ministry.... It is for the\r\n    avowed purpose of carrying on the war with vigour that Reform and\r\n    other things are thrown aside. The Ministry has not asked the House\r\n    of Commons or the country to declare, but has declared itself\r\n    indispensable to the country, and the only possible Ministry\r\n    competent to carry on the war. But if it has already proved, and if\r\n    it daily goes on to prove, itself incompetent in time of peace to\r\n    carry on measures of domestic improvement, and more specially\r\n    incompetent either to prepare for or prosecute a great war, has\r\n    John done right, has he done what the welfare of the country\r\n    requires, in lending himself so long as its indispensable prop? It\r\n    is not incompetent from want of ability, but of unity.... He is\r\n    considered by them to have wedded himself to them for better for\r\n    worse more closely than ever by the withdrawal of Reform.... The\r\n    wretched fears and delays and doubts which have, I firmly believe,\r\n    first produced this war, and then made its beginning of so little\r\n    promise, have had no effect as warnings for the future.... There\r\n    will probably soon be great pressure put upon him to take\r\n    office.... Nothing but the fact of his having no office, of his\r\n    only part in the Government being _work,_ has made him\r\n    struggle along a very dangerous way unattacked and unhurt.... With\r\n    his opinion of Lord Aberdeen's Ministry he would be _doing\r\n    wrong,_ though from no worse motives than excess of deference to\r\n    those with whom he acts, were he, after giving up Reform, to give\r\n    up the degree of independence which he now has.... You can now\r\n    partly conceive how doubtful I feel (and he does too) whether the\r\n    withdrawal of Reform will ultimately be an advantage, though it is\r\n    obvious that a break-up on that was more to be deprecated than on\r\n    almost any other subject. John said this morning of his own accord\r\n    that he feared he had been wrong in ever joining this Ministry. I\r\n    wake every morning with the fear of some terrible national disaster\r\n    before night, of disasters which could be borne if they were\r\n    unavoidable, but will be unbearable if they could have been\r\n    avoided. Do _not,_ pray, think me a croaker without good\r\n    reason for croaking. The greatness of the occasion is not\r\n    understood.\r\n\r\n    Ever, my dearest Papa,\r\n\r\n    Your affectionate child,\r\n\r\n    F.R.\r\n\r\nMatters were coming to a crisis in the Cabinet. The autumn and early winter\r\nof 1854 brought the victories of Alma, Balaclava, and Inkerman. As the\r\ncountry grew prouder of its soldiers its indignation at the way the civil\r\nside of the war had been organized increased. The incompetence of the War\r\nOffice made the Government extremely unpopular, and a motion was brought\r\nforward in the House of Commons charging them with the mismanagement of the\r\nwar. Directly after Mr. Roebuck had given notice of a motion for a\r\nCommittee of Inquiry, Lord John wrote to Lord Aberdeen that since he could\r\nnot conscientiously oppose the motion, he must resign his office. The view\r\nwhich most historians have taken of this step is that it was an act of\r\ncowardly desertion on his part. As a member of the Government, he was as\r\nresponsible as his colleagues for what had been done, and by resigning he\r\nwas admitting that they deserved disgrace. Quotations from two important\r\nhistorical books will show the view which has been generally taken of his\r\naction.\r\n\r\nLord Morley, in his \"Life of Gladstone,\" says:\r\n\r\n    ... When Parliament assembled on January 23, 1855, Mr. Roebuck on\r\n    the first night of the session gave notice of a motion for a\r\n    Committee of Inquiry. Lord John Russell attended to the formal\r\n    business, and when the House was up went home, accompanied by Sir\r\n    Charles Wood. Nothing of consequence passed between the two\r\n    colleagues, and no word was said to Wood in the direction of\r\n    withdrawal. The same evening, as the Prime Minister was sitting in\r\n    his drawing-room, a red box was brought in to him by his son,\r\n    containing Lord John Russell's resignation. He was as much amazed\r\n    as Lord Newcastle, smoking his evening pipe of tobacco in his\r\n    coach, was amazed by the news that the battle of Marston Moor had\r\n    begun. Nothing has come to light since to set aside the severe\r\n    judgment pronounced upon this proceeding by the universal opinion\r\n    of contemporaries, including Lord John's own closest political\r\n    allies. That a Minister should run away from a hostile motion upon\r\n    affairs for which responsibility was collective, and this without a\r\n    word of consultation with a single colleague, is a transaction\r\n    happily without precedent in the history of modern English\r\n    Cabinets. [43]\r\n\r\n[43] Morley's \"Life of Gladstone,\" vol. i, p. 521. See also Lord Stanmore's\r\n\"Earl of Aberdeen,\" chap. X.\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert Paul, in his brilliant \"History of Modern England,\" gives a\r\nversion of this occurrence, which, on the whole, is hardly less harsh\r\ntowards Lord John.\r\n\r\nWell might Lord Palmerston complain of such behaviour as embarrassing. It\r\nwas crippling. It furnished the Opposition with unanswerable arguments.\r\n\"Here,\" they could say, \"is the second man in your Cabinet, in his own\r\nestimation the first, knowing all that you know, and he says 'that an\r\ninquiry by the House is essential. How then can you deny or dispute it?'\"\r\nIn a foot-note he adds, \"Lord John offered to withdraw his resignation if\r\nthe Duke of Newcastle would retire [from the War Office] in favour of\r\nPalmerston. It had been settled before Christmas between Lord Aberdeen and\r\nthe Duke that this change should be made. But no one else was aware of the\r\narrangement, and Lord Aberdeen, though he had assented to it, declined to\r\ncarry it out as the result of a bargain with Lord John.\"\r\n\r\nNow both these versions leave out an important fact in the private history\r\nof the Aberdeen Cabinet. Lord John had on two occasions at least,\r\nsubsequent to giving way upon the question of the Reform Bill, tried to\r\nresign. Only the entreaties of the Queen and his colleagues had induced him\r\nto remain in the Ministry; and then, it was understood, only until some\r\nstriking success of arms should make his resignation of less consequence to\r\nthem. But Sevastopol did not fall, and Lord John hung on, urging in the\r\nmeantime, emphatically and repeatedly, that the efficiency of the war\r\nadministration must be increased, that the control must be transferred from\r\nthe hands of the two Secretaries of War to the most vigorous Minister,\r\nPalmerston. At the Cabinet meeting of December 6th, Lord John desisted from\r\npressing this particular change, owing to Palmerston having written to him\r\nthat he thought there were \"no broad and distinct grounds\" for removing the\r\nDuke of Newcastle, and confined himself, after criticizing the general\r\nconduct of the war, to announcing his intention of resigning in any case\r\nafter Christmas. When it was objected that such an announcement was\r\ninconsistent with his remaining leader of the House of Commons till then,\r\nhe offered to resign at once. He would have gladly done so had they not\r\nimplored him to remain. On December 30th he drew up a memorandum of his\r\ncriticisms upon the conduct of the war; and on January 3rd he wrote to Lord\r\nAberdeen: \"Nothing can be less satisfactory than the result of the recent\r\nCabinets. Unless you will direct measures for yourself, I see no hope for\r\nthe efficient prosecution of the war....\"[44]\r\n\r\n[44] For a full account of these incidents the reader must be referred to\r\nSir Spencer Walpole's \"Life of Lord John Russell,\" chap. xxv.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, on January 23rd, the Opposition demanded an inquiry, he\r\nwas in a very awkward position. He had either to bar the way to changes he\r\nhad been urging himself all along, or he was obliged to admit openly that\r\nhe agreed with the critics of the Government. Had he chosen the first\r\nalternative he would have been untrue to his conviction that a change of\r\nmethod in conducting the war was absolutely essential to his country's\r\nsuccess; yet in choosing the second he was turning his back on his\r\ncolleagues. No doubt the custom of the Constitution asks either complete\r\nacceptance of common responsibility from individual Ministers or their\r\nimmediate resignation. Lord John had protested and protested, but he had\r\n_not_ resigned; he was therefore responsible for what had been done\r\nwhile he was in the Cabinet. He had not resigned because he thought it bad\r\nfor the country that the Government should be weakened while the war was at\r\nits height, and he had hoped that by staying in the Cabinet he would be\r\nable to induce the Ministry to alter its methods of conducting the war.\r\nWhen he discovered that, in spite of reiterated protests, he could not\r\neffect these all-important changes from within, and when the House of\r\nCommons began to clamour for them from without, he decided that no\r\nconsiderations of loyalty to colleagues ought to make him stand between the\r\ncountry and changes so urgently desirable. It may be said that since he had\r\nacted all along on the ground that in keeping the strength of the\r\nGovernment intact lay the best chance of helping to bring the war to a\r\nsuccessful and speedy conclusion, he was inconsistent, to say the least, in\r\ndeserting his colleagues at a juncture which made their defeat inevitable.\r\nBut the inconsistency is only superficial; when he once had lost hope that\r\nthe Government could be got to alter their methods of conducting the war,\r\ntheir defeat and dissolution, which he had previously striven to prevent,\r\nbecame the lesser of two evils. It was not an evil at all, as it turned\r\nout, for the dissolution brought the right man--Palmerston--into power.\r\nLord John's mistake was in thinking that his long-suffering support of a\r\nloose-jointed, ill-working Ministry, like the Aberdeen Ministry, could have\r\never transformed it into a strong one.\r\n\r\nLord Wriothesley Russell, [45] whom Lady John wrote of years before as \"the\r\nmildest and best of men,\" sent her a letter on February 8, 1855, containing\r\nthe following passages:\r\n\r\n    It is impossible to hear all these abominable attacks in silence.\r\n    It makes me sad as well as indignant to hear the world speaking as\r\n    if straight-forward honesty were a thing incredible--impossible. A\r\n    man, and above all a man to whom truth is no new thing, says simply\r\n    that he cannot assent to what he believes to be false, and the\r\n    whole world says, What can he mean by it--treachery, trickery,\r\n    cowardice, ambition, what is it? My hope is that our statesmen may\r\n    learn from John's dignified conduct a lesson which does not appear\r\n    hitherto to have occurred to them--that even the fate of a Ministry\r\n    will not justify a lie. We all admire in fiction the stern\r\n    uprightness of Jeanie Deans: \"One word would have saved me, and she\r\n    would not speak it.\" ... Whether that word would have saved them is\r\n    a question--it was their only chance--and he would not speak it;\r\n    that word revolted his conscience, it would have been false. I know\r\n    nothing grander than the sublime simplicity of that refusal.\r\n\r\n[45] Lord John's stepbrother.\r\n\r\nNearly two years later, Lord John Russell, in a letter to his brother, the\r\nDuke of Bedford, said:\r\n\r\n    ... The question with me was how to resist Roebuck's motion. I do\r\n    not think I was wrong in substance, but in form I was. I ought to\r\n    have gone to the Cabinet and have explained that I could not vote\r\n    against inquiry, and only have resigned if I had not carried the\r\n    Cabinet with me. I could not have taken Palmerston's line of making\r\n    a feeble defence.\r\n\r\nHow absurd it is to suppose that cowardice could have dictated Lord John's\r\ndecision at this time, his behaviour in circumstances to be recounted in\r\nthe next chapter shows. Unpopular as his resignation made him with\r\npoliticians, it was nothing to the storm of abuse which he was forced to\r\nendure when he chose, a few months later, to stand--now an imputed\r\ntrimmer--for the sake of preserving what was best in a policy he had not\r\noriginally approved.\r\n\r\nThe troubles and differences of the Coalition Ministry did not lessen Lord\r\nJohn's regard for Lord Aberdeen, of whom he wrote in his last years: \"I\r\nbelieve no man has entered public life in my time more pure in his personal\r\nviews, and more free from grasping ambition or selfish consideration.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rollo Russell, on the publication of Mr. John Morley's \"Life of\r\nGladstone,\" wrote the following letter to the _Times_ in vindication\r\nof his father's action with regard to Mr. Roebuck's motion:\r\n\r\n    DUNROZEL, HASLEMERE, SURREY, _November,_ 1903\r\n\r\n    SIR,--In his admirable biography of Mr. Gladstone, Mr. Morley has\r\n    given, no doubt without any intention of injury, an impression\r\n    which is not historically correct by his account of my father's\r\n    resignation in January, 1855, on the notice of Mr. Roebuck's motion\r\n    for a Committee of Inquiry. I do not wish to apply to his account\r\n    the same measure which he applies by quoting an ephemeral\r\n    observation of Mr. Greville to my father's speech, but I do\r\n    maintain that \"the general effect is very untrue.\"\r\n\r\n    Before being judged a man is entitled to the consideration both of\r\n    his character and of the evidence on his side. In the chapter to\r\n    which I allude there is no reference to the records by which my\r\n    father's action has been largely justified. There is no mention, I\r\n    think, of these facts: that my father had again and again during\r\n    the Crimean War urged upon the Cabinet a redistribution of offices,\r\n    the more efficient prosecution of the war, the provision of proper\r\n    food and clothing for the Army, which was then undergoing terrible\r\n    privations and sufferings, a better concert between the different\r\n    Departments, and between the English and French camps, and,\r\n    especially, the appointment of a Minister of War of vigour and\r\n    authority. \"As the welfare of the Empire and the success of the\r\n    present conflict are concerned,\" he wrote at the end of November to\r\n    the head of the Government, \"the conduct of the war ought to be\r\n    placed in the hands of the fittest man who can be found for the\r\n    post.\" He laid the greatest stress on more efficient\r\n    administration.\r\n\r\n    The miseries of the campaign increased. On January 30, 1855, Lord\r\n    Malmesbury wrote: \"The accounts from the Crimea are dreadful. Only\r\n    18,000 effective men; 14,000 are dead and 11,000 sick. The same\r\n    neglect which has hitherto prevailed continues and is shown in\r\n    everything.\"\r\n\r\n    He held very strong views as to the duty of the House of Commons in\r\n    regard to these calamities. \"Inquiry is the proper duty and\r\n    function of the House of Commons.... Inquiry is at the root of the\r\n    powers of the House of Commons.\"\r\n\r\n    He had been induced by great pressure from the highest quarters to\r\n    join the Cabinet, and on patriotic grounds remained in office\r\n    against his desire. He continually but unsuccessfully advocated\r\n    Reform. Several times he asked to be allowed to resign.\r\n\r\n    When, therefore, Mr. Roebuck brought forward a motion embodying the\r\n    opinion which he had frequently urged on his colleagues, he could\r\n    not pretend the opposite views and resist the motion for inquiry.\r\n\r\n    The resignation was not so sudden as represented. On the 6th of\r\n    December, 1854, when the Cabinet met, he declared that he was\r\n    determined to retire after Christmas; after some conference with\r\n    his colleagues, he wrote on December 16th to Lord Lansdowne: \"I do\r\n    not feel justified in taking upon myself to retire from the\r\n    Government on that account [the War Office] at this moment.\" It is\r\n    not the case that a severe judgment was pronounced upon these\r\n    proceedings by the \"universal\" opinion of his contemporaries. His\r\n    brother. Lord Wriothesley Russell, wrote: \"It makes one sad to hear\r\n    the world speaking as if straightforward honesty were a thing\r\n    incredible, impossible.\" And the Duke of Bedford: \"My mind has been\r\n    deeply pained by seeing your pure patriotic motives maligned and\r\n    misconstrued after such a life devoted to the political service of\r\n    the public.\" But the whole world was not against him. Among many\r\n    letters of approval, I find one strongly supporting his action with\r\n    regard to the Army in the Crimea and his course in quitting the\r\n    Ministry, and quoting a favourable article in _The Examiner;_\r\n    another strongly approving, and stating: \"I have this morning\r\n    conversed with more than fifty gentlemen in the City, and they\r\n    _all_ agree with me that in following the dictates of your\r\n    conscience you acted the part most worthy of your exalted name and\r\n    character.... We recognize the importance of the principle which\r\n    you yourself proclaimed, that there can be no sound politics\r\n    without sound morality.\" Mr. John Dillon wrote: \"To have opposed\r\n    Mr. Roebuck's motion and then to have defended what you thought and\r\n    knew to have been indefensible would have been not a fault but a\r\n    crime.\"\r\n\r\n    Another wrote expressing the satisfaction and gratitude of the\r\n    great majority of the inhabitants of his district in regard to his\r\n    \"efforts to cure the sad evils encompassing our brave countrymen;\"\r\n    and another wrote: \"The last act of your official life was one of\r\n    the most honourable of the sacrifices to duty which have so\r\n    eminently distinguished you both as a man and a Minister.\"\r\n\r\n    There was no doubt a common outcry against the act of resignation\r\n    at the time, but the outcry against certain Ministers of the\r\n    Peelite group was still louder, and their conduct, as Mr. Morley\r\n    relates, was pronounced to be \"actually worse than Lord John's.\"\r\n    \"Bad as Lord John's conduct was,\" wrote Lord Malmesbury on February\r\n    22, 1855, \"this [of Graham, Gladstone, and Herbert] is a thousand\r\n    times worse.\"\r\n\r\n    The real question, however, is not what the public thought at the\r\n    time, but what a fuller knowledge of the facts will determine, and\r\n    I contend that my father's dissatisfaction with the manner in which\r\n    the war was conducted, and his failure to induce the Cabinet to\r\n    supply an effective remedy, justified if it did not compel his\r\n    resignation.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Roebuck's motion accelerated a resignation which the Prime\r\n    Minister knew had been imminent during the preceding ten weeks.\r\n\r\n    My father himself admitted that he made great mistakes, that for\r\n    the manner of his resignation he was justly blamed, and that he\r\n    ought never to have joined the Coalition Ministry. He had a deep\r\n    sense, I may here say, of Mr. Gladstone's great generosity towards\r\n    him on all occasions. At this distance of time the complication of\r\n    affairs and of opinions then partly hidden can be better estimated,\r\n    and the conduct of seceders from the Government cannot in fairness\r\n    be visited with the reprobation which was natural to\r\n    contemporaries. The floating reproaches of the period in regard to\r\n    my father's action seem to imply, if justified, that he ought to\r\n    have publicly defended the conduct of military affairs which he had\r\n    persistently and heartily condemned. It appears to me that not only\r\n    his candid nature, but the story of his life, refutes these\r\n    reproaches, as clearly as similar reproaches are refuted by the\r\n    life of Gladstone.\r\n\r\n    Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n    ROLLO RUSSELL\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n1855\r\n\r\n\r\nThe debate upon Roebuck's motion of inquiry lasted two nights, and at its\r\nclose the Aberdeen Ministry fell, beaten by a majority of 157. Historians\r\nhave seen in this incident much more than the fall of a Ministry.\r\n\r\nBehind the question whether the civil side of the Crimean campaign had been\r\nmismanaged lay the wider issue whether the Executive should allow its\r\nduties to be delegated to a committee of the House of Commons. \"The\r\nquestion which had to be answered,\" says Mr. Bright in his \"History of\r\nEngland,\" \"was whether a great war could be carried to a successful\r\nconclusion under the blaze of publicity, when every action was exposed not\r\nonly to the criticism and discussion of the Press, but also to the more\r\nformidable and dangerous demands of party warfare within the walls of\r\nParliament.\"\r\n\r\nAfter both Lord John and Lord Derby had failed to form a Government, the\r\nQueen sent for Lord Palmerston.\r\n\r\nLady John, when her husband was summoned to form a Government, wrote to him\r\nfrom Pembroke Lodge on February 3, 1855:\r\n\r\n    All the world must feel that the burden laid upon you, though a\r\n    very glorious, is a very heavy one.... Politics have never yet been\r\n    what they ought to be; men who would do nothing mean themselves do\r\n    not punish meanness in others when it can serve their party or\r\n    their country, and excuse their connivance on that ground. That\r\n    ground itself gives way when fairly tried. You are made for better\r\n    days than these. I know how much better you really are than me....\r\n    You have it in your power to purify and to reform much that is\r\n    morally wrong--much that you would not tolerate in your own\r\n    household.... \"Whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are\r\n    lovely, whatsoever things are honest,\" on these things take your\r\n    stand--hold them fast, let them be your pride--let your Ministry,\r\n    as far as in you lies, be made of such men, that the more closely\r\n    its deeds are looked into, the more it will be admired.... Pray for\r\n    strength and wisdom from above, and God bless and prosper you,\r\n    dearest.\r\n\r\nBut Lord John failing to find sufficient support, Lord Palmerston became\r\nPrime Minister. His first Cabinet was a coalition. It included, besides\r\nsome new Whig Ministers, all the members of the previous Cabinet with the\r\nexception of Lord John, Lord Aberdeen, and the Duke of Newcastle. But on\r\nPalmerston accepting the decision of the last Parliament in favour of a\r\nCommittee of Inquiry, Gladstone, Sidney Herbert, and Sir James Graham\r\nresigned; their reason being that the admission of such a precedent for\r\nsubordinating the Executive to a committee of the House was a grave danger\r\nto the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt looked as though the Ministry would fall, when Lord John, who had\r\npreviously refused office, to the surprise and delight of the Whigs,\r\naccepted the Colonies. His motives in taking office will be found in the\r\nfollowing letters. He had already accepted a mission as British\r\nPlenipotentiary at the Conference of Vienna, summoned by Austria to\r\nconclude terms of peace between the Allies and Russia. He did not therefore\r\nreturn at once to take his place in the Cabinet, but continued on his\r\nmission. Its consequences were destined to bring down on him such a storm\r\nof abuse as the careers of statesmen seldom survive. When Gladstone and the\r\nPeelites resigned, Palmerston's Ministry ceased to be a coalition and\r\nbecame a Whig Cabinet. The fact that Lord John came to Palmerston's rescue,\r\nthat he accepted without hesitation a subordinate office and served under\r\nPalmerston's leadership in the Commons, shows that Lord John's reluctance\r\nto serve in the first instance under Lord Aberdeen could not have been due\r\nto a scruple of pride; nor could his obstinate insistence upon his own way\r\ninside the Cabinet, of which the Peelites had complained in the early days\r\nof Lord Aberdeen's Ministry, have been caused by a desire to make the most\r\nof his own importance.\r\n\r\n    _Lord John to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    PARIS, _February_ 23, 1855\r\n\r\n    I have accepted office in the present Ministry. Whatever objections\r\n    you may feel to this decision, I have taken it on the ground that\r\n    the country is in great difficulty, and that every personal\r\n    consideration ought to be waived. I am sure I give a Liberal\r\n    Government the best chance of continuing by so acting. When I come\r\n    home, I shall have weight enough in the Cabinet through my\r\n    experience and position. In the meantime I go on to Vienna.... I\r\n    shall ascertain whether peace can be made on honourable terms, and\r\n    having done this, shall return home.\r\n\r\n    The office I have accepted is the Colonial; but as I do _not_\r\n    lead in the Commons, it will not be at all too much for my health.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Mr. John Abel Smith to Lady John Russell\r\n\r\n    February_ 24, 1855\r\n\r\n    I received this morning, to my great surprise, a letter from Lord\r\n    John announcing his acceptance of the Seals of the Colonial\r\n    Department.... I believe it to be unquestionably the fact that by\r\n    this remarkable act of self-sacrifice he has saved Lord\r\n    Palmerston's Government and preserved to the Liberal party the\r\n    tenure of power.... I never saw Brooks's more thoroughly excited\r\n    than this evening, and some old hard-hearted stagers talking of\r\n    Lord John's conduct with tears in their eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord John to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    BRUSSELS, _February 25,_ 1855\r\n\r\n    The wish to support a Whig Government under difficulties, the\r\n    desire to be reunited to my friends, with whom when separated by\r\n    two benches I could have had no intimate alliance, the perilous\r\n    state of the country with none but a pure Derby Government in\r\n    prospect, have induced me to take this step. No doubt my own\r\n    position was better and safer as an independent man; but I have\r\n    thrown all such considerations to the winds.... I am very much\r\n    afraid of Vienna for the children; but if you can arrive and keep\r\n    well, it will be to me a great delight to see you all.... I have\r\n    just seen the King, who is very gracious and kind. He thinks I may\r\n    make peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John to Lord John Russell_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _February 26,_ 1855\r\n\r\n    Mr. West called yesterday, and was full of admiration of the\r\n    magnanimity of your conduct, but not of its wisdom. J.A. Smith\r\n    writes me a kind letter telling me of the delight of your late\r\n    calumniators at Brooks's. Frederick Romilly says London society is\r\n    charmed. He touched me very much. He spoke with tears in his eyes\r\n    of the generosity of your motives, and of the irreparable blow to\r\n    yourself and the country from your abandonment of an honourable and\r\n    independent position for a renewal of official ties.... Papa is\r\n    very grave and unhappy, doing justice of course to your motives,\r\n    but fearing that in sacrificing yourself you sacrifice the best\r\n    interests of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord John to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    BERLIN, _March 1,_ 1855\r\n\r\n    It was necessary in order to have any effect to decide at once on\r\n    my acceptance or refusal of office. I considered the situation of\r\n    affairs to be a very serious one. I had hoped that Lord Palmerston,\r\n    with the assistance of the Peelites, might go through the session.\r\n    Suddenly the secession took place, producing a state of affairs\r\n    such as no man ever remembered. Confidence in the Government was\r\n    shaken to a very great extent by the mortality and misery of our\r\n    Army in the Crimea. I could not resist inquiry; but having yielded\r\n    that point, it seemed dastardly to leave men, who had nothing to do\r\n    with sending the expedition to the Crimea, charged with the duty of\r\n    getting the Army out of the difficulty. Yet it was clear that Lord\r\n    Palmerston's Government without my help could hardly stand, and\r\n    thus the Government of 1854 would have been convicted of deserting\r\n    the task they had undertaken to perform. There remained the\r\n    personal difficulty of my serving under Palmerston in the House of\r\n    Commons; for my going to the House of Lords would have been only a\r\n    personal distinction to me and would not have helped Palmerston in\r\n    his difficulty. In the circumstances of the case I thought it right\r\n    to throw aside every consideration of ease, dignity, and comfort.\r\n    If I had not been responsible for the original expedition to the\r\n    Crimea, I would certainly not have taken the office I have now\r\n    accepted. Still, it brings the scattered remnants of the Liberal\r\n    party together and enables them to try once more whether they can\r\n    govern with success.... Lord Minto is now satisfied that I have\r\n    followed a public call; for public men must sacrifice themselves in\r\n    a great emergency. It was not a time to think of self.... We had an\r\n    account of the serious illness of the Emperor of Russia. If he\r\n    should die, I should have good hopes of peace....\r\n\r\n    March 2nd. News come of the Emperor's death. I hope it may be a\r\n    good event for Europe, but it makes me sad at present. \"What\r\n    shadows we are and what shadows we pursue\" constantly occurs to my\r\n    mind.... My mission may perhaps be more successful in consequence,\r\n    but no one can say. At all events you will come to Vienna....\r\n\r\n    Poor little boys and poor little Agatha! I should feel more\r\n    responsible with those children on a journey than with my mission\r\n    and the Colonies to boot.\r\n\r\nIn Paris his conversations with the Emperor confirmed his previous opinion\r\nthat the best hope of peace lay in winning Austria over to the policy of\r\nthe Allies.\r\n\r\nLady John joined him at Vienna early in March. In order to understand the\r\nfollowing extracts it is necessary to recall the history of the whole\r\nnegotiation.\r\n\r\nLord John had been dispatched with vague general instructions, and it must\r\nnot be forgotten that Palmerston was privately much more in favour of\r\ncontinuing the war than Lord John appears to have understood at the time.\r\nPalmerston, like Napoleon III, wished to take Sevastopol before making\r\npeace; Lord John did not therefore receive during his negotiations the\r\nbacking he ought to have had from the Government at home. A hitch occurred\r\nat the outset of the negotiations owing to the delay of instructions from\r\nthe Sultan. This delay was engineered by Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, who\r\nwas determined that Russia should be still further humiliated, and felt\r\nsure of Palmerston's sympathy in doing everything that tended to prolong\r\nthe war. Lord John might complain justly that he was being hindered; but\r\nthe English Ambassador at Constantinople, who knew Palmerston's mind, felt\r\nsafe in ignoring Lord John's remonstrances. The first two Articles which\r\nformed the subject of discussion dealt with the abolition of the Russian\r\nProtectorate over Servia and the Principalities, and with the question of\r\nthe free navigation of the Danube. These Articles were accepted by Russia.\r\nOn the third Article, which concerned the Russian power in the Black Sea,\r\nthe representatives of the Western Powers could not agree. Gortschakoff,\r\nthe Russian emissary, admitted that the Treaty of 1841 would have to be\r\naltered in such a way as would prevent the preponderance of the Russian\r\npower off the coast of Turkey. This could have been secured in two ways:\r\n\r\n  1. By excluding Russian vessels from the Black Sea altogether;\r\n  2. By limiting the number of warships Russia might be permitted to keep\r\n     there;\r\n\r\nbut to neither of these methods would Russia at first agree.\r\n\r\nTwo other alternative proposals were then made by the Austrian Minister,\r\nCount Buol. The first was based on the principle of counterpoise, which\r\nwould give the Allies the right to keep as many ships as Russia in the\r\nBlack Sea. The second was a stipulation that Russia should not increase her\r\nfleet there beyond the strength at which it then stood.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the Allies were instructed from home not to accept\r\nthe proposal of counterpoise. So the second alternative of the Austrian\r\nChancellor was the last remaining chance of Austria and the Allies agreeing\r\nupon the terms to be offered to Russia. Lord John wrote to the Government\r\nurging them to accept this compromise; for in his opinion the only chance\r\nof peace lay in the Allies acting in concert with Austria. At this juncture\r\nhe received a telegram from home saying that the Government were in favour\r\nof a proposal, which had reached them from Paris, for neutralizing the\r\nBlack Sea.\r\n\r\nPrince Gortschakoff at once pointed out that such a plan would leave Russia\r\ndisarmed in the presence of Turkey armed. Lord John considered this a\r\nperfectly just objection on the part of Russia, while the proposal had the\r\nunfortunate effect of detaching Austria from the Allies, who considered\r\nneutralization to be out of the question. M. Drouyn de L'Huys, the French\r\nrepresentative, held the same opinion as Lord John, and when his advice was\r\nnot accepted by the Emperor, he sent in his resignation. Lord John likewise\r\nwrote to Lord Clarendon, then Foreign Secretary, tendering his own.\r\n\r\n    _March 31,_ 1855, VIENNA\r\n\r\n    Private letters from Lord Clarendon and Lord Lansdowne full of\r\n    distrust and disapprobation of the proceedings here, though not\r\n    openly finding fault with John. Lord Clarendon's more especially\r\n    warlike, and anti-Austrian and pro-French; the very reverse of\r\n    every letter he wrote in the days of Lord Aberdeen.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _April 1,_ 1855, VIENNA\r\n\r\n    More letters and dispatches making John's position still worse;\r\n    representing him as ready to consent to unworthy terms, whereas he\r\n    was endeavouring to carry out what had been agreed on by the\r\n    Government. No doubt Lord Clarendon's present tone is far better\r\n    than his former; but that is not the question. John naturally\r\n    indignant and talked of giving up mission and Colonies. This I\r\n    trust he will not do unless there is absolute loss of character in\r\n    remaining, for another breach with Lord Palmerston, who is far less\r\n    to blame than Lord Clarendon, would be a great misfortune--besides,\r\n    it might lead to the far greater evil of a breach with France. I\r\n    rejoice therefore that John has resolved to wait for Drouyn de\r\n    L'Huys and do his utmost to bring matters to a better state.\r\n\r\nOn April 5, at Vienna, when he wished to resign, she wrote: \"Anxious he\r\nshould delay this step till he hears again from home, as he might repent\r\nit, in which case either retracting or abiding by it would be bad. Having\r\nregretted his acceptance of office it seems inconsistent to discourage\r\nresignation, but is not really so. His reputation cannot afford a fresh\r\nstorm, and he must show that he did not lightly consent to belong to a\r\nMinistry of which he knew the materials so well.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of April they came back to England.\r\n\r\n    _May 5,_ 1855, LONDON\r\n\r\n    After all the Emperor rejects the plan [the proposal to limit the\r\n    Russian fleet in the Baltic to its strength at the close of the\r\n    war] on the plea that the army would not bear it. John disturbed\r\n    and perplexed.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _May 6,_ 1855, _Sunday_\r\n\r\n    John went to town for a meeting at Lord Panmure's on Army\r\n    Reform--found here on his return a letter from Lord Clarendon\r\n    telling him that the Emperor had sent a telegram through Lord\r\n    Cowley and the Foreign Office to Walewski, offering him Foreign\r\n    Affairs and asking whether the Queen would agree to Persigny as\r\n    French Ambassador. Thus the dismissal or resignation of Drouyn\r\n    obliged John to resolve on his own resignation unless the Cabinet\r\n    should accept his own view.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord John Russell to Lord Clarendon_ [46]\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _May_ 6, 1855\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR CLARENDON,--I was at Panmure's when your box arrived here,\r\n    and did not get back till past eight. I am very much concerned at\r\n    the removal or resignation of Drouyn. I cannot separate myself from\r\n    him; and, having taken at Vienna the same view which he did, his\r\n    resignation entails mine. I am very sorry for this, and wished to\r\n    avoid it. But I have in some measure got Drouyn into this scrape,\r\n    for at first he was disposed to advise the Emperor to insist on a\r\n    limitation of ships, and I induced him not to give any advice at\r\n    all to the Emperor. Afterwards we agreed very much; and, if he had\r\n    stayed in office there, I might have gulped, though with\r\n    difficulty, the rejection of my advice here. However, I shall wait\r\n    till Colloredo has made a definite proposal, and then make the\r\n    opinion I shall give upon it in the Cabinet a vital question with\r\n    me. It is painful to me to leave a second Cabinet, and will injure\r\n    my reputation--perhaps irretrievably. But I see no other course. Do\r\n    as you please about communicating to Palmerston what I have\r\n    written. I fear I must leave you and Hammond to judge of the papers\r\n    to be given.... But I hope you will not tie your hands or those of\r\n    the Government by giving arguments against what the nation may\r\n    ultimately accept. I hold that a simple provision, by which the\r\n    Sultan would reserve the power to admit the vessels of Powers not\r\n    having establishments in the Black Sea, through the Straits at his\r\n    own pleasure at all times, ... and a general treaty of European\r\n    alliance to defend Turkey against Russia, would be a good security\r\n    for peace. If the Emperor of the French were to declare that he\r\n    could not accept such a peace, of course we must stick by him, but\r\n    that does not prevent our declaring to him our opinion. Walewski\r\n    spoke to me very strongly at the Palace in favour of the Austrian\r\n    plan, but I suppose he has now made up his mind against it.\r\n\r\n    I remain, yours truly,\r\n\r\n    J. RUSSELL\r\n\r\n[46] Spencer Walpole's \"Life of Lord John Russell,\" chap, xxvi.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon replied:\r\n\r\n    GROSVENOR CRESCENT, May 7, 1855\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR LORD JOHN,--... I am very sorry you did not come in just\r\n    now, as I wanted most particularly to see you. I now write this\r\n    _earnestly to entreat_ that you will say nothing to anybody at\r\n    present about your intended resignation. The public interests and\r\n    your own position are so involved in the question, and so much harm\r\n    of every kind may be done by a hasty decision, however honourable\r\n    and high-minded the motives may be, that I do beg of you well to\r\n    weigh _all_ the points of the case; and let me frankly add\r\n    that you will not act with fairness, and as I am sure you must wish\r\n    to act, towards your colleagues, if you do not hear what some of\r\n    them may have to say.\r\n\r\n    As you allowed me to do as I pleased about informing Palmerston, I\r\n    did not think it right to leave him in the dark upon a matter which\r\n    seems to me of vital importance. I need not tell you that your\r\n    intention causes him the deepest regret, and he feels, as I do, how\r\n    essential it is that nothing should be known of it at present. We\r\n    are not even in possession of the facts that led to Drouyn's\r\n    resignation.\r\n\r\n    Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n    CLARENDON\r\n\r\n\"Moved by this appeal,\" says Sir Spencer Walpole, \"and by Lord Palmerston's\r\npersonal entreaties, thrice repeated, Lord John withdrew his resignation.\r\nIts withdrawal, however convenient it may have seemed to the Government at\r\nthe time, was one of the most unfortunate circumstances of Lord John's\r\npolitical career. It directly led to misunderstandings and to obloquy, such\r\nas few public men have ever encountered.\"\r\n\r\n    LONDON, May 8, 1855\r\n\r\n    John given up thoughts of resignation. Glad of it, since he can\r\n    honourably remain. I know how his reputation would have\r\n    suffered--not as an honest man, but as a wise statesman.\r\n\r\nThis was the second time in Lord John's career that his loyalty to the Whig\r\nparty involved him in a false position. On May 24th Disraeli proposed a\r\nvote of censure on the Government for their conduct of the war and\r\ncondemning their part in the negotiations at Vienna. Lord John made, in\r\nreply to Gladstone and Disraeli, an extremely forcible speech, urging that\r\nthe limitation of the number of Russian ships in the Black Sea did not give\r\nsufficient guarantee to the safety of Turkey. Shortly afterwards the\r\nAustrian Chancellor, Count Buol, published the fact that Lord John had been\r\nin favour of this very compromise, which Austria had proposed at the\r\nCongress. He was at once asked whether this was true, and he admitted that\r\nit was. He could not explain that he had taken a different line on his\r\nreturn because, had he stuck to his opinion, the French alliance would have\r\nbeen endangered. The Emperor was persuaded that the fall of Sevastopol was\r\nnecessary to the safety of his throne. Marshal Vaillant had said to him, \"I\r\nknow the feelings of the Army. I am sure that if, after having spent months\r\nin the siege of Sevastopol, we return unsuccessful, the Army will not be\r\nsatisfied.\" [47] Since this was the case, Lord John had had to choose\r\nbetween resigning on the strength of his own opinion that the Austrian\r\nterms were good enough, thus bringing about the fall of the Ministry and a\r\npossible breach with France, or relinquishing his own opinion and defending\r\nthe view of the Government and the Emperor in order to preserve a good\r\nunderstanding with the French. Of course, to all the world it looked as\r\nthough, for the sake of office, he had belied his own convictions. Seldom\r\nhas any Minister of the Crown been placed in a more painful position. The\r\nCabinet knew the true circumstances of the case, and the reason why he\r\ncould give no explanation for his inconsistency: but many of his friends\r\ndid not. A motion of censure was proposed against him, and now that his\r\npresence in the Ministry had ceased to be a support, and had actually\r\nbecome a source of weakness through the condemnation passed on him by the\r\ncountry at large, he offered to resign.\r\n\r\n[47] Kinglake, \"Invasion of the Crimea,\" vol. iii, p. 348.\r\n\r\n    _Lady John to Lord John Russell_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _June_ 8, 1855\r\n\r\n    All is more beautiful than ever this morning.

He is so much here now that my life is quite\r\n    different, and as I know he neglects no duty for the sake of\r\n    coming, I may also allow myself to enjoy it as he does.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _July_ 7\r\n\r\n    Read John's speech and the bitter comments of Cobden and Roebuck.\r\n    Whether he was right or wrong in his views of peace, or in not\r\n    resigning when they were rejected by the Cabinet, he has nobly told\r\n    the simple truth without gloss or extenuation.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _July_ 10\r\n\r\n    John writes that he saw Lord Palmerston and told him that he had\r\n    thought the Austrian proposals ought to be accepted at the time;\r\n    but that he did not think they ought now, after the late events of\r\n    the war. He proposed resignation if it would help the Government.\r\n    Lord Palmerston of course begged him to remain, which he will do.\r\n    The subject is more painful to me the more I think of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _July_ 12\r\n\r\n    An anxious parting with John. He was to go straight to Lord\r\n    Clarendon, to find out what portion of the dispatches Lord\r\n    Clarendon was prepared to give. His explanation to be made to-night\r\n    of a sentence in his Friday's speech, by which some of his\r\n    colleagues understood him to declare his opinion to be that he\r\n    thought the Austrian proposal ought _now_ to be accepted. He\r\n    did _not_ say so, and such an explanation is much to be\r\n    lamented. His position is very painful, and my thoughts about him\r\n    more so than they have ever been, because now many of his best and\r\n    truest friends grieve and are disappointed. God grant he may have\r\n    life, strength, and spirit to work on for his country till he has\r\n    risen again higher than ever in her trust, esteem, and love.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _July_ 13\r\n\r\n    A very anxious morning, thinking of my dear and noble husband,\r\n    doomed to suffer so much for no greater fault than having committed\r\n    himself too far without consultation with his colleagues to a\r\n    scheme which higher duties persuaded him not to abide by when he\r\n    failed to convince them. Anxiety to know his determination and the\r\n    state of his spirits made me send a note up to town early, to which\r\n    I received his answer about four, that he had written his\r\n    resignation last night and sent it to Lord Palmerston this morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John to Lord John Russell_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _July_ 13, 1855\r\n\r\n    We are all well, but I am too anxious to be all day without hearing\r\n    from you; besides, and chiefly, I want to cheer you up and beseech\r\n    you not to let all this depress you more than it ought. Don't\r\n    believe the _Daily News_ when it says you have committed\r\n    political suicide--that need not be a bit more true than that there\r\n    was _trickiness_ or _treachery_ in your course, which it\r\n    also asserts. Depend upon it, it is in your power and it is\r\n    therefore your duty to show that you can still be yourself. You\r\n    will rise again higher than ever if you will but think you can--if\r\n    you will but avoid for the future the rocks on which you have\r\n    sometimes split. There is plenty to do for your country, plenty\r\n    that you can do better than any other man, and _you must not\r\n    sink._ You made, I believe, a great mistake in surrendering your\r\n    own judgment to that of those who surrounded you at Vienna; but who\r\n    can dare to say you were favouring any interest of your own, or\r\n    what malice or ingenuity can pretend to find the shadow of a low or\r\n    unworthy motive? Remember Moore's lines:\r\n\r\n      \"Never dream for a moment thy country can spare\r\n       Such a light from her darkening horizon as thou.\"\r\n\r\n    As to your immediate course, what have you resolved? Surely your\r\n    own resignation is the most natural--you might persuade your\r\n    colleagues, if they require persuasion, to let you go alone, as you\r\n    alone are responsible, that you think a change of Ministry would be\r\n    a misfortune, and that you would be unhappy to find that added to\r\n    your responsibility.... The feeling that the Ministry may be\r\n    sacrificed to you is a very painful one, and I earnestly hope your\r\n    wisdom may find some means of averting this.... Now, my dearest,\r\n    farewell--would that I could go to you myself. I am told that the\r\n    expectation of the Whips is that you will be beat. Tell me as much\r\n    as you can and God speed you.... Good-bye, and above all keep up a\r\n    good heart for your country's sake and mine.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston replied to his offer to resign in the following terms [48]:\r\n\r\n    PICCADILLY, _July_ 13, 1855\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR LORD JOHN,--I have received, I need not say with how much\r\n    regret, your letter of this morning, and have sent it down to the\r\n    Queen. But, whatever pain I may feel at the step you have taken, I\r\n    must nevertheless own that as a public man, whose standing and\r\n    position are matters of public interest and public property, you\r\n    have judged rightly. The storm is too strong at this moment to be\r\n    resisted, and an attempt to withstand it would, while unsuccessful,\r\n    only increase irritation. But juster feelings will in due time\r\n    prevail. In the meantime I must thank you for the very friendly and\r\n    handsome terms in which you have announced to me your\r\n    determination.\r\n\r\n    Yours sincerely, PALMERSTON\r\n\r\n[48] Spencer Walpole's \"Life of Lord John Russell.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _July_ 15, 1855\r\n\r\n    John and I agreed that we felt almost unaccountably happy--there\r\n    is, however, much to account for it--much that cannot be taken from\r\n    us.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to the Duke of Bedford_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _July_ 16, 1855\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR DUKE,--You will like to hear how John has borne his new\r\n    trouble, and I am very glad to tell you that he is in good spirits,\r\n    and as calm as a clear conscience can make him. The week before his\r\n    resignation was a very anxious one, reminding me of that sad and\r\n    anxious day at Woburn when he determined to dismiss Lord\r\n    Palmerston, and of that other when he resolved not to speak to any\r\n    of his colleagues before sending his resignation to Lord Aberdeen.\r\n    Those occasions were so far like this that it was impossible even\r\n    for me, though unable to judge of the questions politically, not to\r\n    foresee painful consequences in the altered relations of old\r\n    friends, and therefore not to lament his decisions; though he had,\r\n    as he was sure to have, high and generous reasons in both cases.\r\n    Here again, there has been much to lament in all that led to his\r\n    resignation and fresh separation from many with whom he has acted\r\n    during half his political life, many so highly valued in public and\r\n    private. One cannot but feel all this, nor do I pretend\r\n    indifference to what is said of him, for I do think the next best\r\n    thing to deserving \"spotless reputation\" is possessing it. But\r\n    there are many comforts--first and foremost, a faith in him that\r\n    nothing can shake; then a firm hope that the country will one day\r\n    understand him better--besides, the relief was immense of finding\r\n    that he would be allowed to resign without breaking up the\r\n    Government. In short, we agreed yesterday that after all our pains\r\n    and anxieties we both felt strangely and almost unaccountably\r\n    happy. Of course, seeing him so was enough to make me so, and\r\n    perhaps there is something too in the unexpected freedom of body\r\n    and soul which loss of office has given him. This state of mind, in\r\n    which he has just left me for London, gives me good hope that he\r\n    will get well through his hard task to-night....\r\n\r\n    Ever yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n    FANNY RUSSELL\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lord Minto_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _July_ 18, 1855\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST PAPA,--I feel very guilty in not having written to you\r\n    since all these great events occurred, but you are pretty well able\r\n    to guess what I felt about them ... and the newspapers are much\r\n    better chroniclers of facts, though not of motives, than I can\r\n    be.... Of course, he proposed resignation immediately after he had\r\n    made his speech, but it was not then thought the Ministry would be\r\n    beat on Bulwer's motion, and Lord Palmerston and the rest begged\r\n    him to remain. Very soon, however, there was no doubt left as to\r\n    what would be the result of the motion, and as neither John nor\r\n    Doddy, the only other person I saw, had a hope that any fresh\r\n    resignation would be accepted, we had the painful prospect of the\r\n    destruction of the Ministry by his means.... But the surprise was\r\n    great as the relief when we found that not one man had the\r\n    slightest difficulty in making up his mind, ... and that one and\r\n    all felt it a paramount duty \"not to shrink from the toils and\r\n    responsibilities of office.\" ... His _spirits_ have not sunk\r\n    and his _spirit_ has risen, and the feeling uppermost in his\r\n    mind is thankfulness that he is out of it all, and has regained his\r\n    freedom, body and soul.... There is plenty left for him to do, and\r\n    I trust he will do it as an independent member of Parliament, and\r\n    in that position regain his lost influence with the country. I am\r\n    most anxious he should not think his political life at an end,\r\n    though his official life may go forever without a sigh.... I ought\r\n    to add that he is on perfectly friendly terms with all his late\r\n    colleagues, ... anxious to help them when he can, but pledged to\r\n    nothing....\r\n\r\n    Ever, dearest Papa,\r\n\r\n    Your affectionate child,\r\n\r\n    F.R.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _July_ 23, 1855\r\n\r\n    Thunderstorm during which I sat in the Windsor summer-house writing\r\n    and thinking many sad thoughts; chiefly of my own ill-performance\r\n    of many duties on which my whole heart and soul were bent. Had I\r\n    but known when we married as much of the world as I know now,\r\n    though I should have been far, far less happy, I should have done\r\n    better in many ways.... Came in; went to my room with Georgy and\r\n    took Baby on my lap. Baby looked at me, saw I had been sad, and\r\n    said gravely, \"Poor Mama,\" adding immediately, \"Where is Papa?\" as\r\n    if she thought my sadness must have to do with him. On my\r\n    answering, \"He is gone to London,\" she put her dear little arms\r\n    round my neck and kissed and coaxed me, repeating over and over,\r\n    \"Never mind, never mind, my dear Mama,\" and again, \"Never mind, my\r\n    poor Mama.\"\r\n\r\nThe state of Lady John's health prevented her from leaving home, but Lord\r\nJohn left Pembroke Lodge with two of the children on August 9th, for a much\r\nneeded holiday in Scotland.\r\n\r\n    _Lord John to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    EDINBURGH, _August_ 10, 1855\r\n\r\n    We got here safely yesterday an hour after time, which made about\r\n    fourteen hours from Pembroke Lodge.... Dearest, it is a very\r\n    melancholy journey; without you to comfort me I take a very gloomy\r\n    view of everything; but I hope the Highland air will refresh me\r\n    with its briskness.... I have a letter from Lord Minto, disturbed\r\n    at my not coming sooner, and supposing I shall be abused for my\r\n    Italian speech, in which he is quite right; but I may save some\r\n    poor devil by my denunciation of his persecutors.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John to Lord John Russell_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _August_ 12, 1855\r\n\r\n    It grieves me to have to write what will grieve you, but it would\r\n    be wrong and useless to hide it from you--I was taken ill suddenly\r\n    yesterday.... What I bear least well is the thought of you. I did\r\n    so hope that after all your political troubles you might be spared\r\n    anxieties of a worse kind; but it was not to be.... I hope,\r\n    dearest, you will not hurry home immediately. I should be so sorry\r\n    to think you only had the fatigue of two long journeys, instead of\r\n    some weeks of Highland air. I know how sadly your enjoyment will be\r\n    damaged, but do not--I beg you, dearest--do not let your spirits\r\n    sink. Nothing would make your poor old wife so sad. Georgy is the\r\n    best and dearest of children and nurses; I am so sorry for her.\r\n    Yesterday she was quite upset, far more than I was, but to-day she\r\n    has taken heart. God bless you. Think what happy people we still\r\n    are--happy far beyond the common lot--in one another and all our\r\n    darlings.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord John heard of her illness, he wrote that he could not be a moment\r\neasy away from her, and came home at once.\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _September_ 8, 1855\r\n\r\n    Thank God! though in bed, I have generally been able to read and\r\n    talk, and for the last two days have given Johnny and the little\r\n    boys their lessons.... Cannot but hope I am a little less impatient\r\n    of illness, a little less unreasonably sorry to be debarred from\r\n    air and liberty and all I care for most in this world, than I used\r\n    to be.... I pray with my whole heart for the true faith and\r\n    patience that can never fail. I pray that, since I cannot teach my\r\n    children how to _do,_ I may teach them how to _bear,_ so\r\n    that even in illness I may not be wholly useless to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n1855-60\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the next four years Lord John remained out of office. He devoted\r\nmuch time to literary work. Besides writing his \"Life of Fox\" and editing\r\nthe papers of his friend Thomas Moore, he delivered three important\r\naddresses. The first was a lecture on the causes which have checked moral\r\nand political progress. As will be seen from Lady John's diary, he was\r\nstill so unpopular that she felt some dread of its reception at the hands\r\nof a large public audience.\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _November_ 13, 1855\r\n\r\n    Great day well over.... At-half-past seven set out for Exeter Hall.\r\n    John well cheered on his entrance, but not so warmly as to make me\r\n    quite secure for the lecture. It was, however, received exactly as\r\n    I hoped--deep attention, interrupted often by applause, sometimes\r\n    enthusiastic, and generally at the parts one most wished applauded.\r\n    A few words from Montague Villiers [49](in asking for a vote of\r\n    thanks), his hope that the whole country would soon feel as that\r\n    audience did towards a man whose long life had been spent in the\r\n    country's service, brought a fresh burst, waving of hats and\r\n    handkerchiefs, etc. Went to bed grateful and happy.\r\n\r\n[49] Afterwards Bishop of Durham.\r\n\r\nIn 1855, Lord John bought a country estate, Rodborough Manor, near Stroud\r\nin Gloucestershire, as he wished to have a place of his own to leave to his\r\nchildren. It was in the parish of Amberley, from which he afterwards took\r\nhis second title and his eldest son, Lord Amberley, made Rodborough his\r\nhome for some years after his marriage.\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lord Dufferin_\r\n\r\n    RODBOROUGH MANOR, STROUD, _November_ 16, 1855\r\n\r\n    DEAR LORD DUFFERIN,--Thanks for your letter. I began to think you\r\n    meant to disclaim all connection with your fallen chief. We have\r\n    just been, he and I alone, spending a week in London. In that\r\n    little week he underwent various turns of fortune--hissed one night\r\n    (though far less than the papers said), cheered the next day by\r\n    four thousand voices, while eight thousand hands waved hats and\r\n    handkerchiefs. I was not at Guildhall, but was at Exeter Hall,\r\n    which was just as it should be; for, in spite of a great many noble\r\n    and philosophical sentiments, which I always keep in store against\r\n    the hissing days, and find of infinite service, I prefer being\r\n    present on the cheering days. I hope you will think his lecture\r\n    deserved its reception. His squiredom agrees with him uncommonly.\r\n    He rides and walks, and drinks ale and grows fat. As for me, I have\r\n    not been at all strong since I came here, but I hope I am reviving\r\n    now, and shall soon be able thoroughly to enjoy a life happy and\r\n    pleasant beyond expression--such peace of mind and body to us both,\r\n    such leisure to enjoy much that we both do enjoy with all our\r\n    hearts and have been long debarred from, are blessings of no small\r\n    value, and when people tell me, by way of cheering me up under a\r\n    temporary disgrace, that he is sure to be in office again soon,\r\n    they little know what a knell their words are to my heart. However,\r\n    _che sara, sara_, and in the meantime we are very happy.\r\n    Yesterday I required some excitement, I must say, to carry me\r\n    through the day, for alas! I struck forty! Accordingly the children\r\n    had provided for it unknown to me, and acted Beauty and the Beast\r\n    with rapturous applause to a very select audience. ... We are much\r\n    pleased with our new home, green and cheerful and varied and pretty\r\n    outside, snug and respectable inside.\r\n\r\n    Ever sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n    F. RUSSELL\r\n\r\n    P.S.--I hear you are going to be married to a great many people;\r\n    please let me know how many reports are true.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 Lady John and the children went abroad. They visited Lady Mary\r\nAbercromby, whose husband was British Minister at the Hague, and later on\r\nthey joined Lord John at Antwerp. Thence they travelled to Switzerland,\r\nwhere they remained till the end of September in a villa beautifully\r\nsituated above the Lake of Geneva, near Lausanne. The early part of the\r\nwinter was spent in Italy, where Lord John came into personal contact with\r\nCavour and many other Italian patriots, whose cause he so staunchly\r\nsupported during the next few years. The Villa Capponi, where they lived at\r\nFlorence, became the meeting-place of all the Liberal spirits in Tuscany;\r\nand the Tuscan Government, who thought that Lord John had come to Florence\r\nto estimate the probable success of the revolutionaries, set spies upon his\r\nvisitors.\r\n\r\n    _Lord John Russell to Lady Melgund_\r\n\r\n    VILLA CAPPONI, _December_ 19, 1856\r\n\r\n    We have passed our time here very agreeably. Besides the\r\n    Florentines and their acute sagacity, we have had here many of\r\n    those whose wits were too bright or their hearts too warm to bear\r\n    the Governments of Naples and Rome.... As for the French\r\n    newspapers, it is the custom at Paris and Vienna to let the\r\n    newspapers attack everything but their own Government, which is\r\n    their notion of the liberty of the Press!\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    VILLA CAPPONI, FLORENCE, _January_ 1, 1857\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST MARY,--You have my first date for the New Year.... God\r\n    grant it may be a happy one to us all. We began it merrily. Mrs. E.\r\n    Villiers, who, with her daughter, is spending the winter here, gave\r\n    a little dance. Twelve struck in the middle of a quadrille, which\r\n    was accordingly interrupted by general shaking of hands among\r\n    chaperons, dancers, and all. There is a cordiality and ease in\r\n    society abroad, the charm of which goes far with me to make up for\r\n    the absence of some of the merits of society in England. The\r\n    subjects of conversation among men are queer, no doubt; but what\r\n    people have in them is much easier to get at--and to me it is a\r\n    relief not to hear all the ladies talking politics, or rather\r\n    talking political personalities, as they do in London.\r\n\r\n    _January_ 2.--I am afraid, after having been abused as\r\n    unworthy of Italy (not so much, however, by you as by Lotty and\r\n    Lizzy) you will now charge me with the far worse sin of being a bad\r\n    Briton--but _that,_ depend upon it, I am not, whatever\r\n    appearances may say--on the contrary, a better one than ever, only\r\n    grieving that with such materials as we have at home we do not\r\n    manage to make social life pleasanter.... Yesterday we had our\r\n    usual Thursday party; and before more than five or six had come, I\r\n    went into the girls' sitting-room, which opens out of the\r\n    drawing-room, and played reels while the girls and two young\r\n    Italians danced--but they had not danced long before our frisky\r\n    Papa followed with Count Ferretti, and not only joined in a reel,\r\n    but _asked_ for a waltz, and whirled round and round with\r\n    Georgy and then with me, and made the old Count do the same. It all\r\n    reminded me of our Berlin evenings, except that Papa, though\r\n    twenty-four years younger then, was not inspired by the German as\r\n    he is by the Italian atmosphere, and never, to my recollection,\r\n    joined us in our many merry unpremeditated dances. It was hardly\r\n    less a wonder to see Henry follow the example yesterday, and add to\r\n    the confusion of the most confused \"Lancers\" I ever saw danced....\r\n    It is impossible to say how this letter has been interrupted....\r\n    The weather being too bright and beautiful to allow us to spend the\r\n    morning indoors, the first interruption was a drive to San Miniato,\r\n    where there is one of the finest views of Florence, and since we\r\n    came home I have been jumping up every five minutes from my\r\n    writing-table to receive one visitor after another--whereas many an\r\n    afternoon passes without a single one--and since they all\r\n    disappeared I have been called upon to help in a rehearsal for a\r\n    second representation of our \"Three Golden Hairs,\" [50] which is to\r\n    take place to-morrow on purpose for Lady Normanby.... The gaiety\r\n    and noise of the rehearsals, the fun of the preparations, and the\r\n    shyness, which effectually prevents any good acting, all reminds me\r\n    of our dear old Minto plays. How very, very long ago all that\r\n    seems! Not long ago in time only, but the changes in everybody and\r\n    everything make the recollection almost like a dream. I was sorry\r\n    to say good-bye to poor old fifty-six, for though not invariably\r\n    amiable to us he has been a good friend on the whole, and one\r\n    learns to be more than grateful for each year that passes without\r\n    any positive sorrow, and leaves no blanks among our nearest and\r\n    dearest. God bless you, dearest Mary; pray attribute blots and\r\n    incoherences to my countless interruptions.\r\n\r\n    Yours ever affectionately,\r\n\r\n    F.R.\r\n\r\n[50] A children's play written by herself.\r\n\r\nOn his return, Lord John continued to give independent support to the\r\nMinistry until circumstances arose which forced him to oppose Palmerston's\r\nforeign policy. In March Cobden brought forward a motion condemning the\r\nviolent measures resorted to against China. Palmerston had justified these\r\nmeasures on the ground that the British flag had been insulted and our\r\ntreaty rights infringed by the Chinese authorities at Canton. A small\r\ncoasting vessel called _The Arrow_ (sailing under British colours, but\r\nmanned by Chinamen, and owned by a Chinaman) had been boarded while she lay\r\nin the river, and her crew carried off by a party from a Chinese warship in\r\nsearch of a pirate, who they had reason to think was then serving as a\r\nseaman on board _The Arrow_. Sir John Bowring, Plenipotentiary at\r\nHong-Kong, demanded that the men should be instantly sent back. It was true\r\nthat _The Arrow_ had at the time of the seizure no right to fly the\r\nBritish flag, for her licence to trade under British colours had expired\r\nthe year before; but he argued that since the Chinese could not have known\r\nthis when they raided the vessel, they had deliberately insulted the flag\r\nin doing so, and afterwards infringed the extradition laws by refusing to\r\nrestore the crew immediately. Upon the British fleet proceeding to bombard\r\nthe forts, the men were released, but the apology and indemnity demanded in\r\naddition were not forthcoming. More forts were then bombarded and a number\r\nof junks were sunk. The real motive of these aggressive proceedings lay in\r\nthe fact that the English traders had not yet been able to get a free\r\nentrance into Canton, in spite of treaties permitting them to trade there.\r\nSir John Bowring made the refusal of apologies an excuse for forcing the\r\nChinese to admit them. Not unnaturally the Chinese retaliated by burning\r\nforeign factories and cutting foreign throats. Meanwhile Palmerston at home\r\ncharacteristically supported Sir John Bowring through thick and thin, and\r\nthe upshot was a long war with China.\r\n\r\nLord John detested aggressive and violent proceedings of this kind. His\r\nspeech on Cobden's motion was one of his finest. The following passage from\r\nit expresses the spirit in which later on he conducted the foreign policy\r\nof England himself:\r\n\r\n    We have heard much of late--a great deal too much, I think--of the\r\n    prestige of England. We used to hear of the character, of the\r\n    reputation, of the honour of England. I trust, sir, that the\r\n    character, the reputation, and the honour of this country are dear\r\n    to us all; but if the prestige of England is to be separated from\r\n    those qualities ... then I, for one, have no wish to maintain it.\r\n    To those who argue, as I have heard some argue, \"It is true we have\r\n    a bad case; it is true we were in the wrong; it is true that we\r\n    have committed an injustice; but we must persevere in that wrong;\r\n    we must continue to act unjustly, or the Chinese will think we are\r\n    afraid,\" I say, as has been said before, \"Be just and fear not.\"\r\n\r\nPalmerston was defeated by sixteen votes, and went to the country on a\r\n\"Civis Romanus\" policy, or, as we should say now, with a \"Jingo\" cry, which\r\nwas immensely popular. Its popularity was so great that there seemed no\r\nchance that Lord John would retain his seat for the City. Even Cobden and\r\nBright were defeated in their constituencies, and the country returned\r\nPalmerston with a majority of seventy-nine. Unpopular since his apparent\r\nchange of front regarding the Vienna treaty, it would have been small\r\nwonder if Lord John had taken the advice of his committee and retired from\r\nthe contest; but he was bent on taking his one-to-hundred chance, and, as\r\nit turned out, his courage won the seat.\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _March_ 7, 1857\r\n\r\n    J.A. Smith called on me to know whether John had determined what\r\n    to do. Said I thought he meant to fight the battle. He looked most\r\n    woeful, and said, \"As sure as I stand here, he will not be the\r\n    member for the City.\"\r\n\r\n    I said I believed he thought it best at all events to stand. \"Ah,\r\n    that's all very well if he had seen a chance of a tolerable\r\n    minority--but if he has only _two or three_ votes!\" He also\r\n    said John had as much chance of being Pope as of being M.P. for the\r\n    City.\r\n\r\nAlthough a lack of the faculty which conciliates individuals was one of the\r\ncriticisms most constantly brought against Lord John as a political leader,\r\nhe certainly possessed the power of overcoming the hostility of a popular\r\naudience, without abating one jot of his own independence or dignity. A\r\nbold, good-tempered directness is always effective in such situations. He\r\nnever lacked the tact of an orator. In this election the Liberal Committee,\r\non the first rumour of his resignation, without verifying it, or notifying\r\ntheir intentions to Lord John, substituted Mr. Raikes Currie, late member\r\nfor Northampton, as their Liberal candidate. Lord John at once called a\r\nmeeting to protest against the action of the committee. The following\r\npassage in his speech was received with enthusiastic applause, and did much\r\nto secure a favourable hearing for his anti-Palmerstonian views during the\r\ncampaign. It must be remembered that he had represented the City for\r\nsixteen years.\r\n\r\n    \"If a gentleman were disposed to part with his butler, his\r\n    coachman, or his gamekeeper, or if a merchant were disposed to part\r\n    with an old servant, a warehouseman, a clerk, or even a porter, he\r\n    would say to him, 'John, I think your faculties are somewhat\r\n    decayed; you are growing old, you have made several mistakes; and I\r\n    think of putting a young man from Northampton in your place.' I\r\n    think a gentleman would behave in that way to his servant, and\r\n    thereby give John an opportunity for answering. That opportunity\r\n    was not given to me. The question was decided in my absence; and I\r\n    come now to ask you, and the citizens of London, to reverse that\r\n    decision.\"\r\n\r\nHis success won back for him some of the general admiration which he had\r\nforfeited by his loyalty to the Ministers in 1855. Many of the best men in\r\nEngland rejoiced in his triumph; among them Charles Dickens wrote his\r\ncongratulations.\r\n\r\n    _Lord John Russell to Lady Melgund_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _April_ 1, 1857\r\n\r\n    ...The contest has brought out an amount of feeling in my favour\r\n    both from electors and non-electors which is very gratifying. ...It\r\n    is the more pleasant, as all the merchant princes turned their\r\n    princely backs upon me, and left me to fight as I could (the two\r\n    Hankeys alone excepted)....Fanny has not been very well since the\r\n    election ... but this blessed place will, I hope, soon restore her.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lord Minto_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _April_ 4, 1857\r\n\r\n    The City election engrossed my thoughts for many days, and made it\r\n    difficult to write to anybody who cared as much about it as you\r\n    till it was over. I have since spent my life in answering letters\r\n    and receiving visits of congratulation, most of them very hearty\r\n    and sincere, and accordingly very pleasant. I thought my days of\r\n    caring for popular applause were over, but there was something so\r\n    much higher than usual in the meaning of the cheers that greeted\r\n    John whenever he showed himself, that I was not ashamed of being\r\n    quite delighted. There was obviously a strong feeling among the\r\n    electors and non-electors, in Guildhall and in the streets, that\r\n    John had been unfairly and ungratefully set aside, which far\r\n    outweighed the effect of his unpopular opinions on ballot and\r\n    church rates. Altogether there was a good tone among the people (by\r\n    which I don't mean only one of attachment to John) which made me\r\n    proud of them. Next to the pleasure of seeing and hearing with my\r\n    own eyes and ears how strong his hold upon his countrymen still is,\r\n    was the pleasure I was wicked enough to feel at the reception which\r\n    greeted the unfortunate Raikes Currie.\r\n\r\n    The repose of Pemmy Lodge, which I hope you will by and by share\r\n    with us, is very welcome after our noisy triumph.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Charles Dickens to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    _May_ 22, 1857\r\n\r\n    DEAR LADY JOHN,--Coming to town yesterday morning out of Kent, I\r\n    found your kind and welcome note referring to the previous day. I\r\n    need not tell you, I hope, that although I have not had the\r\n    pleasure of seeing you for a long time, I have of late been\r\n    accompanying Lord John at a distance with great interest and\r\n    satisfaction. Several times after the City election was over I\r\n    debated with myself whether I should come to see you, but I\r\n    abstained because I knew you would be overwhelmed with\r\n    congratulations and I thought it was the more considerate to\r\n    withhold mine.\r\n\r\n    I am going out of town on Monday, June 1st, to a little\r\n    old-fashioned house I have at Gad's Hill, by Rochester, on the\r\n    identical spot where Falstaff ran away, and as you are so kind as\r\n    to ask me to propose a day for coming to Richmond, I should very\r\n    much like to do so either on Saturday the 30th of this month or on\r\n    Sunday the 31st.\r\n\r\n    I heard of you at Lausanne from some of my old friends there, and\r\n    sometimes tracked you in the newspapers afterwards. I beg to send\r\n    my regard to Lord John and to all your house.\r\n\r\n    Do you believe me to remain always yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\n    CHARLES DICKENS\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lord Minto_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _September_ 27, 1857\r\n\r\n    John's reception at Sheffield equalled anything of the kind I had\r\n    ever seen in our \"high and palmy\" days. So little had we expected\r\n    _any_ reception, that when we arrived at the station and saw\r\n    the crowds on the platform I could not think what was the matter,\r\n    and it was not till there was a general rush towards our carriage\r\n    and shouts of John's name that I understood it was meant for him.\r\n    From the station we had to drive all through the town to Alderman\r\n    Hoole's villa; it was one loud and long triumph. John and Mr. Hoole\r\n    and I were in an open carriage, the children following in a closed\r\n    one. We went at a foot's pace, followed and surrounded by such an\r\n    ocean of human beings as I should not have thought all Sheffield\r\n    could produce, cheering, throwing up caps and hats, thrusting great\r\n    hard hands into the carriage for John to shake, proposing to take\r\n    off the horses and draw us, etc. Windows and balconies all thronged\r\n    with waving women and children, and bells ringing so lustily as to\r\n    drown John's voice when, at Mr. Hoole's request, he stood up on the\r\n    seat and made a little speech. All this honour from one of the most\r\n    warlike towns in the kingdom will surprise you, no doubt; indeed, I\r\n    am not sure that you will quite approve.\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _December 25, 1857_\r\n\r\n    A bright and lovely Christmas.... Sat more than an hour in the\r\n    sunny South summer-house, listening to birds singing and boys and\r\n    little May [51] talking and laughing.... Dear, darling children,\r\n    how I grudge each day that passes and hurries you on beyond blessed\r\n    childhood.... I am too happy--there can hardly be a change that\r\n    will not make me less so.... A glorious sunset brought the glorious\r\n    day to an end.\r\n\r\n[51] Mary Agatha.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Charlotte Portal_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _December_ 26, 1857\r\n\r\n    I cannot remember a happier Christmas than ours has been, and I am\r\n    sure nobody can remember a milder or brighter Christmas sky. I sat\r\n    more than an hour yesterday in the sunny South summer-house,\r\n    listening to the songs of the blackbirds and thrushes, who have\r\n    lost all count of the seasons, and to the merry voices of the boys\r\n    and little May, and thinking of many things besides, and wishing I\r\n    could lay my hand on old Father Time and stop him in his flight,\r\n    for he _cannot_ bring me any change for the better, and he\r\n    must very soon take away one of the best joys of my daily life,\r\n    since he must take away childhood from my bairnies.\r\n\r\n    In the meantime I know I am not ungrateful, and when the little\r\n    boys in their evening prayer thanked God for making it \"such a\r\n    happy Christmas,\" oh! how I thanked Him too. We have had a\r\n    Christmas-tree, and for many days before its appearance the\r\n    children were in a state of ungovernable spirits, full of\r\n    indescribable fun and mischief, and making indescribable uproar.\r\n    John has been by no means the least merry of the party, and seeing\r\n    a game at \"my lady's toilet\" going on yesterday evening, could not\r\n    resist tacking himself to its tail and being dragged through as\r\n    many passages and round as many windings as Pemmy Lodge affords.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Palmerston Ministry seemed firmly seated in power and were\r\ncertainly capable of carrying out the spirited and aggressive foreign\r\npolicy on which they had so successfully appealed to the country, an\r\nunexpected event occurred during the recess of 1857 which led to their\r\ndownfall. On the night of January 14th some Italian patriots threw three\r\nbombs under Napoleon's carriage as he was driving to the Opera. The Emperor\r\nand Empress had a narrow escape, and many spectators were killed or\r\nwounded. The outrage was prompted by a frantic notion that the death of\r\nNapoleon III was an indispensable step towards the freedom of Italy.\r\nOrsini, the leader of the conspirators, was not himself of a crazy criminal\r\ntype. He was a fine, soldier-like fellow, who had fought and suffered for\r\nhis country's independence, and he had many friends in England among lovers\r\nof Italy who never suspected that he was the kind of man to turn into an\r\nassassin. When it was discovered that the plot had been hatched in London\r\nand the bombs made in Birmingham, a feverish resentment seized the whole\r\nFrench Army. Addresses were sent by many regiments congratulating Napoleon\r\non his escape, in which London was described as _ce repaire\r\nd'assassins_ and much abusive language used. The Press, of course, on\r\nboth sides, fanned the flame, and for some days the two nations were very\r\nnear war. The French Ambassador requested the Government to make at once\r\nmore stringent laws against refugee aliens, and in answer to this request\r\nPalmerston brought in a Conspiracy to Murder Bill. Lord John informed the\r\nGovernment that he, for his part, would oppose any such measure as an\r\nignominious capitulation to a foolish outcry.\r\n\r\n    _Lady John Russell to Lady Mary Abercromby_\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _February_ 4, 1858\r\n\r\n    I have never seen John more moved, more mortified, more indignant,\r\n    than on reading a letter from Sir George Grey yesterday announcing\r\n    the intention of the Ministry to make an alteration in the\r\n    Conspiracy Laws under the threats of an inconceivably insolent\r\n    French soldiery. He had heard a rumour of such an intention, but\r\n    would not believe it. He thinks very seriously of the possible\r\n    effects of debates on the measure, and feels the full weight of his\r\n    responsibility; but he is nevertheless resolved to oppose to the\r\n    utmost of his power what he considers as only the first step in a\r\n    series of unworthy concessions. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _February_ 20, 1858\r\n\r\n    John woke me at two with the news of a majority for the amendment\r\n    (234 to 215)--the country spared from humiliation, the character of\r\n    the House of Commons redeemed. But, privately, what will become of\r\n    our victory? Lay awake with the nightmare of coming office upon\r\n    me--went to sleep only to dream that John was going to the scaffold\r\n    (being interpreted, the Treasury Bench).\r\n\r\nAlthough the division was taken in a very small house, as the above figures\r\nshow, Palmerston resigned, and after some hesitation the Queen charged Lord\r\nDerby with forming a Government. This was the second time Lord Derby had\r\nattempted to govern with a majority against him in the House of Commons.\r\nThe first task of the new Ministry was to patch up the quarrel with France,\r\nand, thanks to the good sense and dignity of the Emperor, it was managed in\r\nspite of the scandalous acquittal by an English jury of the Frenchman, Dr.\r\nBernard, who had manufactured Orsini's bombs. The Duc de Malakoff, whose\r\nconduct in the Crimea made him a popular hero in England, replaced M.\r\nPersigny at the French Embassy. His presence helped to remind Englishmen\r\nthat it was not many years since they had fought side by side with French\r\nsoldiers, and resentment against the Emperor's army died away.\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _October_ 30, 1858\r\n\r\n    Dinner at Gunnersbury. Met Malakoffs, D'lsraelis, Azeglio. Never\r\n    before had opportunity for real conversation with D'lsraeli--a sad\r\n    flatterer and otherwise less agreeable than so able a man of such\r\n    varied pursuits ought to be.\r\n\r\nAlthough these years of comparative leisure had been welcome to them both,\r\nthe issues at stake in Europe were so important that Lord John could not\r\nhelp wishing he again had an opportunity of directly influencing events.\r\n\r\nHe writes to his wife on December 15, 1858:\r\n\r\n    When I reflect that a Reform Bill and the liberation of Italy are\r\n    \"looming in the distance,\" it gives me no little wish to be in\r\n    office; but when I consider what colleagues I should have, I am\r\n    cured of any such wish. I can express my own opinions in my own\r\n    way.\r\n\r\nHe feared that he would not have hearty support from his colleagues in his\r\nviews on Italy and Reform, which accounts for the above allusion.\r\n\r\nIn March the Ministry were defeated on Disraeli's Reform Bill, and\r\nParliament was dissolved. Meanwhile Italy's struggle against Austria was\r\nexciting much deeper interest than franchise questions. On June 24, 1859,\r\nthe battle of Solferino was fought. Although the Austrians were beaten, the\r\ncost of victory to the Italians and French was very heavy. The fortunes of\r\nthe whole campaign, indeed, had hitherto been due more to the incompetence\r\nof Austrian generalship than either to the strength of the allies or to the\r\nweakness of the Austrian position. Though Solferino was the fifth victory,\r\nthe others had been also dearly bought, and the allies still remained\r\ninferior in numbers. Besides, should Austria go on losing ground there was\r\nmore than a chance that Prussia would invade France, when the prospects of\r\nItaly would have been at an end, and England too, in all probability,\r\ninvolved in a general war. Napoleon, who knew the unsoundness of his own\r\narmy, dreaded this contingency himself; though the English Court\r\nsupposed--and continued to suppose, strangely enough--that to provoke a war\r\nwith Prussia was the ultimate end of his policy. Generally speaking, the\r\nEnglish people were enthusiastically Italian, while the Court and\r\naristocracy were pro-Austrian. \"I remarked,\" wrote Lord Granville to Lord\r\nCanning at this time, \"that in the Lords, whenever I said anything in\r\nfavour of the Emperor or the Italians, the House became nearly sea-sick,\r\nwhile they cheered anything the other way, as if pearls were dropping from\r\nmy lips.\"\r\n\r\nThe elections did not strengthen Lord Derby sufficiently, and in June he\r\nresigned.\r\n\r\n    \"Lord Derby's Government was beaten this morning,\" writes Lord\r\n    Malmesbury, [52] \"by a majority of 13.... The division took place\r\n    at half-past two, and the result was received with tremendous\r\n    cheers by the Opposition. D'Azeglio (the Piedmontese Minister) and\r\n    some other foreigners were waiting in the lobby outside, and when\r\n    Lord Palmerston appeared redoubled their vociferations. D'Azeglio\r\n    is said to have thrown his hat in the air and himself in the arms\r\n    of Jaucourt, the French attaché, which probably no ambassador, or\r\n    even Italian, ever did before in so public a place.\"\r\n\r\n[52] \"Memoirs of an Ex-Minister.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not easy to choose Lord Derby's successor, since the Liberal party\r\nwas divided; but its two leaders, Palmerston and Lord John, agreed to\r\nsupport each other in the event of either of them being charged with the\r\nformation of the new Government. The Queen, either because she was\r\nreluctant to distinguish between two equally eminent statesmen, or because\r\nshe did not know of their mutual agreement, or more likely because she did\r\nnot wish the foreign policy of England to be in the hands of Ministers with\r\nprofessed Italian sympathies, commissioned Lord Granville to make the\r\nattempt, who, though he felt some sympathy for the patriots, considered the\r\npeace of Europe far more important than the better government of Italy.\r\nAfter he had failed she sent for Palmerston, under whom Lord John became\r\nForeign Secretary. This change of Government had a happy and instant effect\r\nupon the prosperity of the Italian cause. Technically, England still\r\nmaintained her neutrality with regard to the struggle between Austria and\r\nVictor Emmanuel, backed by his French allies; but the change of Ministry\r\nmeant that instead of being in the hands of a neutral Government with\r\nAustrian sympathies, the international negotiations upon which the union\r\nand freedom of Italy depended were now inspired by three men--Palmerston,\r\nRussell, and Gladstone--who did all in their power, and were prepared,\r\nperhaps, to risk war, in order to forward the policy of Victor Emmanuel and\r\nCavour.\r\n\r\nLady John unfortunately lost her diaries recording events from May, 1859,\r\nto January, 1861; but it is known that she was in close sympathy with her\r\nhusband's policy, and she looked back upon the part he played in the\r\nliberation of Italy with almost more pride than upon any other period of\r\nhis career. Italian patriots and escaped prisoners from the Papal and\r\nNeapolitan dungeons found a warm welcome at Pembroke Lodge. She was never\r\ntired of listening to their stories, and she felt an enthusiastic ardour\r\nfor their cause.\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, May 9, 1859\r\n\r\n    Farewell visit from Spaventa and Dr. Cesare Braico, [53] who goes\r\n    to Piedmont Wednesday. Spaventa full of eager but not hopeful talk\r\n    on Neapolitan prospects, Dr. Braico very quiet, crushed in spirits,\r\n    but not in spirit.\r\n\r\n    \"For me the illusions of life are past,\" he said. \"I have given the\r\n    flower of my youth to my country in prison--what remains to me of\r\n    life is hers.\"\r\n\r\n    In answer to some commonplace of mine about hope he replied, \"To\r\n    those who have suffered much the word hope seems a lie.... While I\r\n    was in prison my mother died--my only tie to life.\" Said he left\r\n    England with regret, and should always gratefully remember the\r\n    sympathy he had found here. Told him I thought there was not\r\n    enough. \"More than in my own country. We passed through four\r\n    villages on our way to the port after leaving the prison; not one\r\n    person looked at us or gave us a word of kindness; not a tear was\r\n    in any eye; not one blessing was uttered.\" I wondered. I supposed\r\n    the people (the Neapolitans) were _avilis_. \"More than\r\n    _avilili--sono abbruttati_.\" All these sad words, and many\r\n    more, in beautiful Italian, would have touched any heart, however\r\n    shut to the great cause for which he and others have given their\r\n    earthly happiness, and are about to offer their lives. As I looked\r\n    at that fine countenance, so determined, so melancholy, and\r\n    listened to the words that still ring in my ear, I felt that,\r\n    though he did not say so, he meant to die in battle against\r\n    tyranny. He gave me some verses, written with a pencil at the\r\n    moment, to little May, who ran into the room while he was here.\r\n    Farewell, brave, noble spirit. May God be with thee!\r\n\r\n[53] Spaventa and Braico had been prisoners in Italy for about ten years.\r\n\r\nTo get clear what Lord John's share was in the creation of Italy, we must\r\nremember what hampered him at home and what difficulties he contended with\r\nin the councils of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Palmerston Cabinet, as far as ability went, was exceptionally strong.\r\nLord Granville, himself a member of it, had failed in his own attempt,\r\nbecause Lord John had stipulated that he should lead the Commons, and that\r\nforeign affairs should be in no other hands but Palmerston's; while\r\nPalmerston, who was as necessary as Lord John to any strong Whig\r\nGovernment, had declined to serve unless he led the Commons. The motive of\r\nLord John's demand that Palmerston should be Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nis clear; he did not trust Lord Granville where Italy was concerned. He\r\nthought extremely well of his qualifications as Foreign Minister--he had\r\npreviously appointed him his own Foreign Secretary--but Lord Granville had\r\nobjected shortly before to Lord Clarendon's dispatch to Naples, in which\r\nFerdinand II's misrule had been condemned in terms such as might have\r\npreceded intervention. This dispatch had had Lord John's ardent sympathy,\r\nwhile Lord Granville had disapproved of it on the grounds that in diplomacy\r\nthreatening language should not be addressed to a small State which\r\nprudence would have moderated in dealing with a powerful one, and that the\r\nwhole tenor of the dispatch was calculated to draw on a European war.\r\n\r\nIt was these views upon Italian questions--namely, that peace was\r\nall-important and that little kingdoms, however corrupt and despotic,\r\nshould not be browbeaten, which made Lord Granville so acceptable to the\r\nCourt. Throughout the next two years he was the principal agent through\r\nwhom the Queen and the Prince Consort attempted to mitigate the pro-Italian\r\npolicy of Lord John and Palmerston. The Cabinet itself was divided on the\r\nsubject; the \"two old gentlemen,\" as Sidney Herbert called them, were for\r\nstretching England's \"neutrality\" to mean support of every kind short of\r\n(and even at the risk of) committing us to intervention; while the rest of\r\nthe Cabinet, with the important exception of Gladstone, were more or less\r\nin favour of abstaining from any demonstration on one side or the other.\r\nWhen Palmerston came into power the matters stood thus: Austria, after\r\nlosing the battle of Solferino, was securely entrenched within her four\r\nstrong fortresses of Verona, Mantua, Peschiera, and Legnago, but her\r\nEmperor was already disheartened and disgusted by the fighting.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, too, on his side was anxious for peace--most anxious, in fact, to\r\nextricate himself as soon as possible from the dangerous complications in\r\nwhich his alliance was likely to land him. On the eve of Solferino he had\r\nheard that Prussia, ready for war, was concentrating at Coblenz and\r\nCologne, and he knew well there was no army in France capable of much\r\nresistance. He began, too, to realize that success pressed home might lead\r\nto the formation on the south-east border of France of a new--and perhaps\r\nformidable--Italian power; a possibility he had not considered when he\r\nplanned with Cavour at Plombières their secret alliance against Austria.\r\nThe war was now becoming unpopular with far-sighted Frenchmen precisely\r\nbecause its success plainly tended towards this issue; and, in addition,\r\nthe formation of such a kingdom, by implying the confiscation of the Papal\r\nterritories, was most distasteful to his Catholic subjects, with whom\r\nNapoleon already stood badly and wished to stand better. After a brief\r\narmistice, he proposed terms of peace to Austria, which were signed at\r\nVillafranca on July 9th. They ran as follows:\r\n\r\nLombardy was to be surrendered to France and then handed over to Italy; the\r\nItalian States were to be formed into a Federation under the honorary\r\npresidency of the Pope (this was intended to soothe French Catholics);\r\nVenetia, while remaining under Austrian rule, was to be a member of the\r\nFederation, and the Dukes of Tuscany and Modena were to resume their\r\nthrones. Napoleon wished to add a further stipulation that neither side\r\nshould use their armies to secure this latter object, but over this there\r\nrose so much haggling that the outcome was only an understanding between\r\nthe two Emperors (not committed to paper) that Austria would not oppose the\r\nestablishment of constitutional government in those States, should they\r\nthemselves desire it, but at the same time she retained by her silence her\r\nright to interfere for other reasons; while France on her side asserted\r\nthat she would neither restore the Dukes by force of arms herself nor--and\r\nhere lay a point of great importance--allow Austria to interfere should she\r\nact upon the right she had reserved.\r\n\r\nAs may be imagined, to men who had set their hearts on a free united Italy,\r\nsuch a treaty was exasperating. However aware Victor Emmanuel might be that\r\nhe owed much to France, he could not but be bitterly disappointed by\r\nNapoleon withdrawing his help when the struggle had just begun and when the\r\nfreedom of Lombardy alone had been won. Cavour resigned in a passion of\r\nresentment that Victor Emmanuel should have countenanced such a peace.\r\n\"Siamo traditi\" was the cry at Milan and Turin. Yet Napoleon had already\r\ndone much for the union of Italy; in fact, he had done more than he knew,\r\nand far more than he ever intended. Though no one at first fully realized\r\nit, the stipulation that Austria should not attempt to use force to restore\r\nthe fugitive Dukes, and that France should abstain from similar\r\ninterference, really opened a path for the union of Italy. This was the\r\nfirst important juncture at which Lord John brought valuable assistance to\r\nthe cause of \"Italy for the Italians,\" since he kept Napoleon to his\r\npromise, after he had good reasons to regret it, and bent the whole weight\r\nof England's influence towards persuading reluctant Austria to accept on\r\nher side the principle of complete non-intervention.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the terms of Villafranca, in so far as the\r\nquestion of armed intervention was concerned, had never been finally\r\nratified; and it was Napoleon's wish that the European Powers should form a\r\nCongress at Zürich, at which the Convention would acquire the stability of\r\na European treaty, and the nature of the proposed Italian Federation be\r\nfinally defined. Lord John and Palmerston, while protesting against the\r\nclause of the treaty which, by including Venice in the Federation, still\r\nleft Austria a preponderating influence in Italian affairs, refused to take\r\npart in this Congress unless Napoleon promised beforehand to withdraw his\r\narmy from Italy as soon as possible, and to join England in insisting that\r\nno Austrian troops should be allowed in future to cross the borders of\r\ntheir own Venetian territory.\r\n\r\nAt home the English Court did its best to prevent its Ministers exacting\r\nthese promises. It was the Queen's strong wish that the Federation of Italy\r\nand the restoration of the Dukes of Parma and Modena should stand as\r\nAustria's compensation for yielding Lombardy to Italy, and that the\r\nCongress at Zürich should insist upon these conditions forming part of the\r\nultimate European treaty. She objected to the pressure which Lord John was\r\napplying to France, on the ground that in making England's presence\r\nconditional upon an assurance that Napoleon would consider terms more\r\nfavourable to Italian independence than those already signed at\r\nVillafranca, her Ministers were abandoning neutrality and intervening\r\ndeliberately upon the side of Victor Emmanuel. The contest between the\r\nCourt and the Foreign Office was obstinate on both sides; at one time it\r\nseemed likely that Palmerston and Lord John would be forced to resign. Lord\r\nJohn succeeded, however, in obtaining a favourable assurance from Napoleon\r\nto the effect that if it should prove impossible to construct an Italian\r\nFederation in which Austria _could_ not predominate, he would accept a\r\nproposal for an Italian Federation from which Austria was excluded\r\nentirely. On these terms England consented to appear; but after all these\r\nintricate delays the Congress, dated to meet in January, 1860, never sat.\r\nIn December a pamphlet, inspired by Napoleon himself, entitled \"Le Pape et\r\nle Congrès,\" had appeared, which advocated the Pope's abandonment of all\r\nterritory beyond the limits of the patrimony of St. Peter, and declared\r\nthat the settlement of this important matter should lie not with the\r\nCongress, but in the hands of Napoleon himself. If these were the Emperor's\r\nown views, Austria pronounced that she could take no part in the Congress;\r\nfor she would then be denied a voice in decisions very near her interests\r\nas a Catholic Power and the first enemy of Italian union. The Congress\r\nconsequently fell through.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile events had been moving rapidly in Italy. Relieved from the\r\nimmediate fear of Austrian coercion, the Tuscan Assembly had voted their\r\nown annexation to the kingdom of Piedmont, and the duchies of Modena and\r\nParma and the Romagna soon followed suit. The question remained, could\r\nVictor Emmanuel venture to accept these offers? He had the moral support of\r\nEngland on his side, and in his favour the threat of Napoleon that should\r\nAustria advance beyond her Venetian territory, the French would take the\r\nfield against her; but on the other hand, Austria declared that if the King\r\nof Piedmont moved a single soldier into these States she would fight at\r\nonce, and Napoleon, while he threatened Austria, did not wish Victor\r\nEmmanuel to widen his borders. Cavour was now again at the head of the\r\nPiedmontese Government, and the problem of British diplomacy was to propose\r\nterms so favourable to Italian liberty that Cavour would not be tempted to\r\nprovoke another war as a desperate bid for a united Italy, and yet of a\r\nkind that France and Austria would accept. The terms Lord John offered\r\nwere: (1) that Austria and France should both agree to abstain from\r\nintervention, except at the invitation of the five Great Powers; (2) that\r\nanother vote should be taken in those States which had desired to\r\namalgamate with Piedmont before the King should be free to enter their\r\nterritories. The other provisions dealt with the preservation of the\r\n_status quo_ in Venetia and the withdrawal of the French troops from\r\nRome and Northern Italy.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the first clause was merely a reiteration, a\r\nreinforcement with Europe to back it, of the clause which Napoleon, blind\r\nto its results, had attempted to induce the Emperor of Austria to put upon\r\npaper at Villafranca. Having failed then, he had contented himself with\r\nannouncing that he would not interfere himself, nor allow Austria to\r\ninterfere, by force of arms in Italy, a promise to which English diplomacy\r\nhad from that moment firmly held him. We have seen, too, that before Lord\r\nJohn had consented to take part in the Zurich Congress, he had exacted from\r\nNapoleon an assurance that he would consider, as an alternative to the\r\nFederation proposed at Villafranca, the formation of an Italian Federation\r\nin which Venice (or in other words Austria) should have no part whatever.\r\nSuch a Federation would not have been very different from the amalgamation\r\nwith Piedmont which the other States had just proposed of their own accord;\r\nand consequently the Emperor of the French could not well protest against\r\nLord John's proposals without repudiating all his earlier negotiations.\r\nThus England and Italy now held France on their side, an unwilling ally in\r\ndiplomacy, and Austria, on whom Lord John had endeavoured all along to\r\nforce the principle of non-intervention, at last gave way. She refused,\r\nhowever, to commit herself for the future, or to admit that she had not the\r\nright to interfere at any time in Italy's affairs; but she let it be known\r\nthat, for the present, reluctance to renew war with France and Piedmont\r\nwould determine her actions. Of course the people of the States confirmed\r\ntheir vote in favour of annexation, and on April 2, 1860, the first\r\nParliament representing Piedmont and Central Italy met at Turin.\r\n\r\nThis was the first stage in the making of Italy. When it was completed\r\nthere remained only three independent Powers (excluding Austrian Venice)\r\ndividing the peninsula among them--in the north the new kingdom of\r\nPiedmont; in the centre the diminished Papal States; in the south the\r\nkingdom of Naples. Lord John, as the spokesman of England, by playing off\r\nNapoleon, who was no friend to Italian unity, against Francis Joseph, who\r\nwas the prime enemy of Italian freedom, had secured for Italy an\r\nopportunity to work out her own salvation. He and Cavour together had\r\nforced Napoleon to prevent Austria from checking what Napoleon himself\r\nwould have liked to prevent.\r\n\r\nSubsequently it came to light that Napoleon's surprising readiness in\r\nagreeing to the annexation of Central Italy in April had been due to a\r\nprivate arrangement between him and Cavour in the previous month. It was\r\nagreed between them in March that Savoy and Nice should be handed over to\r\nFrance as the price of her acquiescence. In the secret treaty of\r\nPlombières, Napoleon's reward for helping the Piedmontese, should the war\r\nleave Venice, Lombardy, and the Romagna in Victor Emmanuel's hands, had\r\nbeen fixed as the cession of these territories to France. But since\r\nNapoleon had withdrawn and made peace when, as yet, only Lombardy had been\r\nwrested from Austria, he had waived his claim upon Nice and Savoy at\r\nVillafranca, and claimed in exchange a contribution towards his expenses in\r\nthe war. But the moment Piedmont proposed to annex Tuscany, the Romagna and\r\nthe Duchies, he returned to his original claim. His action had two\r\nimportant results: one which immediately added to the complication of\r\nItalian politics, and one which affected the diplomatic relations of the\r\nGreat Powers for the next eleven years. In Italy his demand made a lasting\r\nbreach between Cavour and Garibaldi. The latter never forgave the cession\r\nof Nice, his native town, to France, and never could be convinced that the\r\nsacrifice of Italian territory was a necessary step towards uniting Italy.\r\nIn his eyes the agreement with Napoleon had been a kind of treason on the\r\npart of Cavour. Among the European Powers, on the other hand, Napoleon's\r\naction created an impression, which was never effaced, that he was a\r\npredatory and treacherous power.\r\n\r\nIn England the news was received with the greatest indignation. Lord John\r\nwas extremely angry, and practically threatened war. He, like Garibaldi,\r\ndid not realize that Cavour was driven to the concession, nor that Napoleon\r\nwas, in truth, compelled on his side to demand what he did. The following\r\nletter from Sir James Hudson, the English Minister at Turin--\"uomo\r\nitalianissimo,\" as Cavour called him--is particularly interesting, because,\r\nthough addressed to Lady John, it reads as though it were also intended for\r\nthe eyes of the Foreign Secretary, from whom indignation had temporarily\r\nconcealed the truth that this sacrifice was the only compensation which\r\nwould have induced Napoleon to look on quietly while the new kingdom of\r\nItaly was consolidating on his frontier. The last event Cavour desired was\r\na war between the two Powers whose unanimity forced neutrality upon\r\nAustria. Napoleon on his side was practically obliged to demand Savoy and\r\nNice as a barrier against Italy, and because the acquisition of territory\r\nalone could have prevented his subjects from feeling that they had lost\r\ntheir lives and money only to further the aims of Victor Emmanuel.\r\n\r\n    _Sir James Hudson to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    TURIN, _April_ 6, 1860\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR LADY JOHN,--I have seen Braico--Poerio brought him to me\r\n    after I had offered my services to him in your name, and we have\r\n    combined to dine together and to perform other feats, besides\r\n    gastronomic ones, in order to cheer him whilst he resides in these\r\n    (to a Parthenopean) Boeotian regions.\r\n\r\n    You mention in your letter the name of that scandal to royalty,\r\n    Louis Napoleon. What can I say of him? Hypocrite and footpad\r\n    combined. He came to carry out an \"idea,\" and he prigs the silver\r\n    spoons. \"Take care of your pockets\" ought to be the cry whenever he\r\n    appears either personally or by deputy.\r\n\r\n    But do not, I beg of you, consider and confound either the King of\r\n    Sardinia or Cavour as his accomplice. Think for a moment on the\r\n    condition of Sardinia, who represents the nascent hope of Italy.\r\n    Think of the evil that man meant--how he tried to trip up the heels\r\n    of Tuscany, establish a precarious vicarial existence for the\r\n    Romagna, and plots now at Naples. Not to have surrendered when he\r\n    cried \"stand and deliver\" would have been to have risked all that\r\n    was gained--would have given breathing time to Rome, reinforced and\r\n    comforted Rome's partisans in the Romagna--have induced doubt,\r\n    fear, and disunion throughout Italy. Judging by the experience of\r\n    the last eight years, I must say I saw no means of avoiding the\r\n    rocks ahead save by a sop to Cerberus. But do not lose confidence\r\n    in the National party--Cavour or no Cavour, Victor Emmanuel or\r\n    another, that party is determined to give Italy an Italian\r\n    representation. I regret that the Nizzards (who have a keen eye to\r\n    the value of building lots) are wrenched from us by a French\r\n    _filou_; but I cannot forget that the Savoyards have\r\n    constantly upheld the Pope, and have been firm and consistent in\r\n    their detestation of Liberal Government in Sardinia. _I am not\r\n    speaking of the neutral parts_, please remember.\r\n\r\n    Your most devoted servant,\r\n\r\n    JAMES HUDSON\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the reign of Francis II of Naples and the Two Sicilies, who had\r\nsucceeded Ferdinand, was proving if anything worse than his father's. Early\r\nin 1860 insurrections began to break out in Sicily, and on May 5th\r\nGaribaldi, on his own initiative, set sail from Genoa to help the rebels.\r\n\"I go,\" he said, \"a general without an army, to fight an army without a\r\ngeneral.\" His success was extraordinarily rapid. At the end of May he had\r\ntaken Palermo from 24,000 regular troops with his volunteers and some\r\nSicilian help, thus making the dictatorship of Sicily, which he had\r\ndeclared on landing, a reality. It soon became known that he intended to\r\nrecross to the mainland to free the people of Naples itself. Piedmont, of\r\ncourse, wished Garibaldi to succeed in this further undertaking. His cause\r\nwas her cause. Though this action was entirely independent, his\r\ndictatorship had been avowed as a preliminary step to handing over the\r\nisland to Victor Emmanuel. The King could not, therefore, oppose him nor\r\nprevent him re-embarking for Naples without separating himself from the\r\ncause of United Italy and making an enemy of almost every patriot in the\r\ncountry; but both he and Cavour were afraid either that Garibaldi might\r\nfail, in which case the union of Italy would have been postponed for many\r\nyears, or that the pace at which changes were coming would lead France or\r\nAustria to interfere again.\r\n\r\nFrance, of course, was most anxious to stop the further increase of the\r\npower of Piedmont, and therefore to check Garibaldi. Napoleon's idea of\r\n\"United Italy\" was a federation of separate States under the presidency of\r\nthe Pope, who in his turn would be under the influence of France. He at\r\nonce put pressure upon Cavour and Victor Emmanuel, compelling the latter to\r\nwrite to Garibaldi, telling him to stop in Sicily. Thus, in spite of her\r\ndesire that Garibaldi should sail and succeed, Piedmont was compelled\r\npublicly to express disapproval of his intention. In England it was\r\nsupposed that Cavour meant what he made the King say in his letter to\r\nGaribaldi, and in addition Palmerston, who was glad enough to see the old\r\nGovernments of the little States tumbling to the ground, was rather alarmed\r\nat the prospect of a United Italy, which would also be a Mediterranean\r\nPower. Hitherto the honour of assisting Italy had belonged equally to him\r\nand to Lord John. Henceforward, however, Lord John, who had been brought up\r\nin the Fox tradition, and whose Italian sympathies had been fortified by\r\nhis wife's enthusiasm, definitely took the lead in determining England's\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nThe aim of Cavour was to help the revolution as much as possible without\r\nmaking it obvious to Europe that he was doing so; but, like everybody else,\r\nLord John had taken him at his word, and thought that the liberation of\r\nItaly might be retarded by Garibaldi's departure from Sicily for the\r\nmainland, till information reached him that in reality Piedmont was most\r\nanxious nothing should hinder Garibaldi's attack upon Naples. It reached\r\nhim apparently in the following manner.\r\n\r\nCavour determined to appeal to the Russells personally through a secret\r\nagent. With this object Mr. Lacaita [afterwards Sir James Lacaita], who had\r\nbeen exiled from Naples for having helped Gladstone to write his famous\r\nletters upon the state of the Neapolitan prisons, which Lacaita knew from\r\ninside, was instructed to call upon Lord John in London and to tell him\r\nthat in spite of her official declaration, Piedmont was desperately anxious\r\nthat Garibaldi should drive the King of Naples from the throne; for\r\nGaribaldi's extraordinary success in Sicily had made his failure on the\r\nmainland far less likely, and Cavour was now certain that there was not\r\nmuch power of resistance left in the Neapolitan kingdom. Lacaita, though\r\nill in bed, got up and went to deliver his message. He was told that Lord\r\nJohn was closeted with the French and Neapolitan ambassadors and could not\r\nsee him. Lacaita guessed that Lord John was at that very moment talking\r\nover the means of preventing Garibaldi's expedition, and he immediately\r\ndecided to ask for Lady John. When informed that she was seriously ill, he\r\ninsisted upon being taken up into her bedroom, and adjured her for the love\r\nof Italy to get Lord John away from the ambassadors at once. A scribbled\r\nnote begging her husband to come to her immediately brought him upstairs in\r\nsome alarm. And there he learnt from Lacaita that Victor Emmanuel's letter\r\nof July 25th was a blind, that united Italy must be made now or never, and\r\nthat he would never be forgiven if England stopped Garibaldi.\r\n\r\nThis incident is recorded by several persons to whom Mr. Lacaita told the\r\nstory. [54] It explains the sudden right-about of English diplomacy at this\r\njuncture, which, as Persigny shows in his memoirs, puzzled and astonished\r\nhim. For Lord John having received this information, refused to act with\r\nFrance in preventing Garibaldi from crossing the Straits of Messina. This\r\nhe accordingly did, and marched straight on to Naples, where he was\r\nwelcomed as a deliverer; the royal troops deserted or retreated to Capua,\r\nand Garibaldi made his entrance into Naples, as was said in the House of\r\nCommons, \"a simple traveller by railway with a first-class ticket.\" Before\r\nthe end of October the King of Sardinia and Garibaldi met near Teano and\r\nGaribaldi saluted Victor Emmanuel as King of Italy.\r\n\r\n[54] Lady John's diaries of 1860 being lost, this incident is given here on\r\nthe sole authority of the late Sir James Lacaita.\r\n\r\nOn October 27, 1860, Lord John wrote a dispatch, in which he said that--\r\n\r\n    Her Majesty's Government can see no sufficient grounds for the\r\n    severe censure with which Austria, France, Prussia, and Russia have\r\n    visited the acts of the King of Sardinia. Her Majesty's Government\r\n    will turn their eyes rather to the gratifying prospect of a people\r\n    building up the edifice of their liberties and consolidating the\r\n    work of their independence....\r\n\r\nLord John also quoted from \"that eminent jurist Vattel\" the following\r\nwords: \"When a people from good reasons take up arms against an oppressor,\r\nit is but an act of justice and generosity to assist brave men in the\r\ndefence of their liberties.\"\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Odo Russell to Lord John Russell_\r\n\r\n    ROME, _December_ 1, 1860\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR UNCLE,--Ever since your famous dispatch of the 27th, you\r\n    are blessed night and morning by twenty millions of Italians. I\r\n    could not read it myself without deep emotion, and the moment it\r\n    was published in Italian, thousands of people copied it from each\r\n    other to carry it to their homes and weep over it for joy and\r\n    gratitude in the bosom of their families, away from brutal\r\n    mercenaries and greasy priests. Difficult as the task is the\r\n    Italians have now before them, I cannot but think that they will\r\n    accomplish it better than we any of us hope, for every day\r\n    convinces me more and more that I am living in the midst of a\r\n    _great_ and _real_ national movement, which will at last\r\n    be crowned with perfect success, notwithstanding the legion of\r\n    enemies Italy still counts in Europe.\r\n\r\n    Your affectionate nephew,\r\n\r\n    ODO RUSSELL\r\n\r\nSuch was the second important juncture at which the British Ministry came\r\nto the rescue of the Italian nationalists. If after Villafranca the\r\nnegotiations which secured the safety of Italy were the work of three men,\r\nPalmerston, Lord John, and Gladstone, contending against an indifferent and\r\ntimid Cabinet and the opposition of the Court--it is clear that when the\r\nsuccess or failure of Italian unity was a second time at stake, the\r\ndecision and initiative were Lord John's.\r\n\r\nAfter his retirement, when he was travelling with his family in 1869, they\r\ntook a villa at San Remo. The ceiling of the _salon_ was decorated\r\nwith those homely frescoes so common in Italy, which in this case consisted\r\nof four portraits--Garibaldi, Cavour, Mazzini, and--to their surprise--Lord\r\nJohn himself. Next to the national heroes he was associated closest in the\r\nminds of the people with the achievement of their independence.\r\n\r\nWhen Garibaldi came to England in the spring of 1864, and received a more\r\nthan royal welcome, Pembroke Lodge was, naturally, one of the first houses\r\nhe visited. On April 21, 1864, Lady John writes in her diary:\r\n\r\n    All looked anxiously to the sky on getting up--all rejoiced to see\r\n    it bright. Sunshine the whole day. Garibaldi to luncheon at\r\n    Pembroke Lodge. Our school children, ranged alongside of approach\r\n    with flags, cheered him loudly. All went well and pleasantly.\r\n\r\n    John gave him a stick of British oak. Garibaldi gave John his own\r\n    in exchange.\r\n\r\n    Agatha gave him a nosegay of green, red, and white--he kissed her\r\n    on the forehead. Much interesting conversation with him at\r\n    luncheon. Told him he would be blamed by many for his praise of\r\n    Mazzini yesterday. He said that he and Mazzini differed as to what\r\n    was best for Italy, but Mazzini had been his teacher in early\r\n    youth--had been unjustly blamed and was _malheureux_. \"Et j'ai\r\n    cru devoir dire quelque chose,\" and that he (Garibaldi) had been in\r\n    past years accused of being badly influenced by Mazzini: \"Ceux qui\r\n    ont dit cela ne me connaissent pas.\" That when he acts it is\r\n    because he himself is convinced he ought. Inveighed bitterly\r\n    against Louis Napoleon, whom he looks upon as _hors la loi_.\r\n    Simple dignity in every word he utters.\r\n\r\n    Park full of people. Richmond decorated with flags.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n1859-66\r\n\r\n\r\nSince only political events in which Lady John was herself deeply\r\ninterested or those which affected her life through her husband's career\r\nare here to the purpose, the other international difficulties with which\r\nLord John had to deal as Secretary for Foreign Affairs in this Government\r\nmay be quickly passed over. And for the same reason the domestic politics\r\nof these years require only the briefest notice. Palmerston's Ministry\r\nproduced very little social legislation, and the fact that Lord John was at\r\nthe Foreign Office, while the Prime Minister led the Commons, increased the\r\nlegislative inactivity of a Government which, with Palmerston at its head,\r\nwould in any case have changed little in the country. Gladstone's budgets\r\nand Cobden's Free-Trade Treaty with France were the important events.\r\nBetween 1860 and 1864 the taxation of the country was reduced by twelve\r\nmillions, the National Debt by eleven millions, and the nation's income\r\nincreased by twenty-seven millions, while foreign trade had risen in two\r\nyears by seventy-seven millions. These were the most splendid results a\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer has ever been able to show; but the changes by\r\nwhich it had been achieved had been far from welcome to Palmerston himself.\r\nIt had required great resolution on Gladstone's part to carry the Prime\r\nMinister with him.\r\n\r\nMany comments have been made on the indifference which the country showed\r\nto domestic reform during these years of Liberal Government; but it is not\r\nvery surprising. It is a familiar fact that when foreign affairs are\r\nexciting the people are not eager about social or political reform, a fact\r\nupon which Governments have always been able to count. And foreign affairs\r\nhad been very exciting. Under Lord John and Palmerston our own foreign\r\npolicy had been bold and peremptory; the policy of France was directed by\r\nNapoleon, whose head, as Palmerston said, was as full of schemes as a\r\nrabbit-warren is of rabbits; and the quarrel of 1852 between Prussia and\r\nDenmark had arisen again in a far acuter form. It was, therefore, natural\r\nthat popular attention should be constantly turned abroad.\r\n\r\nThe deaths of those who linked Lady John with her childhood now came\r\nquickly. Her father, Lord Minto, died a month after Lord John had taken\r\noffice. He had been ailing for some time.\r\n\r\n    LONDON.--PEMBROKE LODGE, _May_ 2, 1859\r\n\r\n    John at 7 a.m. to Huntingdon to propose Mr. Heathcote at\r\n    nomination; back to Pembroke Lodge about five, having been very\r\n    well received, but chiefly by the _ill-dressed_. Papa\r\n    surprisingly well--saw him on my way out of town; far the happiest\r\n    sight I had yet had of him. Dear Papa, he looked so pleased, smiled\r\n    so brightly when he saw me. \"Ah, dear Fanny! How glad I am to see\r\n    you! How fresh and well you look.\" Held my hand all the time I was\r\n    with him.... I said I hoped in his place I should be as\r\n    patient--that he was an example to us all, as he always had\r\n    been.... Said few daughters could look back at my age without being\r\n    able to remember having heard from their father one word but of\r\n    love and kindness....\r\n\r\nHe died on July 31, 1859. His keen interest in public questions continued\r\nto the end, with a firm belief in the ultimate triumph of good. \"Magna est\r\nveritas et prevalebit\" were almost the last words he spoke on his\r\ndeath-bed.\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn of 1860 Lord John accompanied the Queen to Coburg, where\r\nboar-shooting with the Prince Consort and Court-life (he never liked its\r\nformalities) failed to console him for absence from wife and children.\r\n\r\n    _Lady John to Lord John Russell_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _October_ 11, 1860\r\n\r\n    I found two letters from you here.... So you are fairly on your\r\n    journey and safe so far. And here I am with my large detachment,\r\n    all well and merry, and all at dear beloved home again after our\r\n    wanderings. I am so thankful, and I hope to be still more so in\r\n    five days, when I am no longer doomed to sing \"There's nae luck\r\n    about the house,\" as I have done daily for three weeks.... That you\r\n    should have killed a wild boar is all but incredible, and makes me\r\n    expect to see you with a long moustache and green _Fäger_\r\n    costume.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1861, Lord John's second daughter, Victoria, married Mr.\r\nVilliers, son of the Bishop of Durham. Lady John wrote some verses to her\r\non her marriage which are published in Walpole's \"Life of Lord John\r\nRussell.\"\r\n\r\nIn May the Duke of Bedford died. The Duke had been Lord John's close\r\nfriend, and had often advised him at the beginning of his career. He was\r\none of those influential noblemen who watch politics with unflagging\r\ninterest, but without the smallest desire to take an active part in them.\r\nIt was his pride and pleasure to know the ins and outs of a situation\r\nperhaps even better than some of the principal actors in it, and his\r\njudgment was always at his brother's service. On his death Lord John\r\ninherited the Ardsalla estate in Ireland. The loss of his brother\r\nprecipitated perhaps an intention he had considered for some time of saving\r\nhis strength by accepting a peerage, and exchanging the strenuous life of\r\nthe House of Commons for the lighter work of the House of Lords. The\r\nexchange was effected in July, when Lord John became Earl Russell.\r\n\r\n    \"Very dismal about the peerage,\" writes Lady John in her diary,\r\n    \"and seeing only the sad side of it.... John made a fine speech on\r\n    Sardinia, perhaps his last in the House of Commons.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Minto [55] to Lady John Russell_\r\n\r\n    _July_ 20, 1861\r\n\r\n    ...It is impossible not to feel _very sad_ in parting with a\r\n    name which has so long been the rallying point of the Liberal\r\n    party, the watchword of all those who in our day have fought the\r\n    good fight, and, whatever name he may bear, it will never carry to\r\n    English ears the same sound as \"Lord John.\" People older than\r\n    ourselves had looked to it with hope; and in our time, whenever\r\n    Liberty has been in danger, or truth or justice or the national\r\n    honour has been attacked, the first question which rose to men's\r\n    lips was, \"What will Lord John do?\"....I remember his first speech\r\n    on the China War in 1856. How empty the House was when he rose, how\r\n    rapidly it filled to overflowing; then the intense silence which\r\n    followed the rush, and lastly the overpowering cheers from all\r\n    sides as he went on. To leave the scene where he has so long\r\n    wielded at will the, alas! _not fierce_ \"democracie\" (and it\r\n    will be milder still without him!) must require immense\r\n    self-control and self-denial.\r\n\r\n[55] Formerly Lady Melgund. Her husband had now succeeded his\r\nfather as third Earl of Minto.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord John Russell to Lady Minto_\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _July_ 23, 1861\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST NINA,--It seems very bad of us not to have explained\r\n    duly and deliberately that I have the project resolved upon and\r\n    decided of accepting a peerage. But there have been many changes in\r\n    my mind before the final leap was resolved upon. Forty-seven years\r\n    of the House of Commons are enough for any man, and imply a degree\r\n    of wear and tear which those who read the speeches listlessly at\r\n    the breakfast table have little conception of. A reply which is to\r\n    go to Paris, Petersburg, Turin, and Washington requires much\r\n    presence of mind, and often much previous thought, work, etc. A\r\n    calmer atmosphere will suit better my old age, but I could not\r\n    leave my companions on the Treasury Bench while any change was\r\n    impending, and if I were to wait till 1862 I might again find the\r\n    ship in a storm, and be loath to take to the boat. About a title\r\n    for Johnny there is still some doubt, but I shall be Earl Russell,\r\n    and make little change in the signature of\r\n\r\n    Your affectionate brother,\r\n\r\n    J. RUSSELL\r\n\r\nIn August Lord and Lady Russell and their children went to Abergeldie\r\nCastle, which had been lent to them for several successive autumns. Their\r\nfree and happy life in the Highlands was delightful to them all. In October\r\nLady Russell writes: \"Left our beautiful Highland home.... Very very\r\nthankful for all our happy Abergeldie days.\"\r\n\r\nIn the April of this year the American Civil War had broken out, and the\r\nMinistry had been obliged to decide the question whether England should\r\nrecognize the Southerners as \"belligerents\" or accept the Northern view of\r\nthem as \"rebels.\" The touchiness of the Northerners, and the fact that in\r\nEngland many people sympathized loudly with the South, made it difficult\r\nfor the Ministry to maintain the attitude of neutrality, which, while\r\nrecognizing the Southern Confederacy as a belligerent Power, they had\r\nofficially declared in May. In November two Commissioners, sent by the\r\nConfederacy to put the case of the South before the Courts of Europe, were\r\nforcibly seized on board the _Trent_, an English, and therefore a\r\nneutral, vessel. This was a breach of international law, and the resentment\r\nit provoked in England was increased by the truculent attitude of the North\r\nin the face of our demand for the restoration of the Commissioners. The\r\nCongress, instead of apologizing, proceeded to pass a vote of thanks to\r\nCaptain Wilks for having intercepted the _Trent_.\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_ [56]\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _December_ 13, 1861\r\n\r\n    When the account of the seizure of the Southern Commissioners first\r\n    reached us I was afraid of the effect on John's health and spirits,\r\n    as you may well believe; but, as you say, he could not but feel\r\n    that there had been no fault on our side, that not a word had been\r\n    spoken, not a deed done by him but what showed the friendliest\r\n    feeling to the United States, and the strongest wish to remain at\r\n    peace with them. I wish the newspapers were blameless; but there\r\n    was a sneering, exulting tone in many of them after the military\r\n    disasters of the North which was likely to irritate. Mr. Motley\r\n    said long ago that the _Times_ would, if possible, work up a\r\n    war between the two countries, and though I can't speak from my own\r\n    knowledge, as I have seldom looked at its articles, I have no doubt\r\n    from what John and others say that he was right.... There can be no\r\n    doubt that we have done deeds very like that of Captain Wilks--not\r\n    exactly like, because no two cases ever are so--but I wish we had\r\n    not done them, and I suppose and hope we shall admit they were very\r\n    wrong. It is all terrible and awful, and I hope and pray war may be\r\n    averted--and whatever may have been the first natural burst of\r\n    indignation in this country, I believe it would be ready to\r\n    execrate the Ministry if all right and honourable means were not\r\n    taken to prevent so fearful a calamity.\r\n\r\n[56] Her husband, Mr. Ralph Abercromby, was now Lord Dunfermline.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _December_ 19, 1861\r\n\r\n    John to town to see Mr. Adams [57].... John's interview with Mr.\r\n    Adams encouraging. Mr. Adams showed him a dispatch from Mr. Seward\r\n    declaring Government to be quite uncommitted as to opinion on\r\n    seizure of Commissioners.\r\n\r\n[57] American Minister in London.\r\n\r\nIn December the Prince Consort died. Almost his last public act was to\r\nmodify the dispatch sent in reply to the vote in Congress, so that it\r\noffered the North an opportunity of relaxing with dignity their\r\nuncompromising attitude.\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Charlotte Portal_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _December_ 24, 1861\r\n\r\n    I know you, like everybody, must have been thinking much of our\r\n    poor desolate Queen. Her anguish, her loneliness of heart on that\r\n    pinnacle of human greatness, must weigh on all who have known how\r\n    happy she was; but to us who have often seen that lost happiness,\r\n    it is almost like a grief of our own. I don't believe I have ever\r\n    seen her take his arm without the thought crossing my mind: \"There\r\n    is the real blessing of your life--that which alone makes you as\r\n    happy a woman as others in spite of your crown.\" Everybody must\r\n    have been full of dread of the effect upon her, but she has borne\r\n    up nobly--or rather, she has bowed humbly to God's will, and takes\r\n    comfort in her children. It must be soothing to her that his rare\r\n    worth is now fully acknowledged and gratefully felt by the whole\r\n    nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _January_ 7, 1862\r\n\r\n    John to town at twelve, back at half-past six; dispatches and\r\n    letters from Lord Lyons of December 26th discouraging, cabinet\r\n    still considering our demands. Surrender possible, but in Lord\r\n    Lyons's opinion very unlikely.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _January_ 8, 1862\r\n\r\n    Telegram to John at 6 p.m. Commissioners surrendered! Thank God.\r\n    General rejoicing in the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _January_ 13, 1862\r\n\r\n    Well, what do you say to our American triumph? It ought to go far\r\n    to cure you all. It is long since any political event has given me,\r\n    my particular self, such unmixed pleasure. For my country, for my\r\n    husband, and for the other country too, with all its sins, I\r\n    rejoice with all my heart and soul. John is delighted. He was very\r\n    anxious up to the last moment.\r\n\r\n    ...We \"Plodgians\" were all so delighted that it has been a surprise\r\n    to us to hear of the very tempered joy, or rather the ill-concealed\r\n    disappointment, of _London society_; but John says London\r\n    society is always wrong, and I believe the country to be all right.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _February_ 10, 1863\r\n\r\n    You ask me about Kinglake's book--everybody except ourselves is\r\n    reading or has read it.... With regard to the sleepy Cabinet dinner\r\n    at Pembroke Lodge he has from what we hear fallen into great\r\n    inaccuracy.... John says that the despatch, having been circulated\r\n    in the Cabinet before that dinner, was already well known to them\r\n    all. As far as he remembers none but Sir William Molesworth went to\r\n    sleep. I remember perfectly how several of them told me afterwards\r\n    about Sir William sleeping and falling from his chair, and we have\r\n    often laughed about it, but I do not remember being told of anybody\r\n    else going to sleep. I suppose I shall read the book, but I cannot\r\n    tell you how I shrink from anything that must recall and make one\r\n    live over again those terrible months of vacillation and weakness,\r\n    the consequence of a Coalition Cabinet, which \"drifted\" us into a\r\n    most terrible war--a war from which consistency and firmness would\r\n    have saved us. A thoroughly Aberdeen Ministry would have maintained\r\n    peace. A thoroughly Russell or Palmerston Ministry would have\r\n    maintained peace and honour too.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord Russell to Lady Minto_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _July_ 9, 1863\r\n\r\n    Parliament is coming to an end, most people being tired of talking\r\n    and everybody of listening.... Lord Chelmsford says in honour of\r\n    the House of Lords: \"The Commons have a great deal to do and they\r\n    don't do it--the Lords have nothing to do and they do it.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1863 relations between England and America were again strained. English\r\nvessels were perpetually running the blockade to bring cotton to England\r\nand goods to the Southern ports--a risky but highly profitable business.\r\nThey were often captured by Northern cruisers and forfeited. There were\r\ncomplaints on our side that the Federal courts were not always careful to\r\ndistinguish in their decisions between cases of deliberate blockade-running\r\nand legitimate trading with ports beyond the Southern frontier. The North,\r\nbesides blockade-running, had a further cause of complaint. The\r\nConfederates were getting cruisers built for them in neutral ports. The\r\nmost famous case of the kind was that of the _Alabama_, which was\r\nbuilt in the Mersey. The English Government had information of its\r\ndestination, but failed to prevent it sailing--a failure which eventually\r\ncost us an indemnity of £3,000,000. The speech referred to in the following\r\nletter was made in the midst of these troubles. It was a defence of\r\nEngland's good faith in the matter of the _Alabama_ and an assertion\r\nthat Americans should be left to settle their own difficulties without\r\nEuropean mediation. At this time the French Government and a strong party\r\nin England were in favour of European intervention. By securing the\r\nindependence of the South, they hoped to diminish the power of the United\r\nStates in the future. Such an idea could only be entertained while the\r\nstruggle between North and South seemed evenly balanced. The next year\r\nshowed the hopelessness of such a project and vindicated the wisdom of the\r\nEnglish Government in having refused to attempt to divide America into two\r\nindependent Powers.\r\n\r\n    _Mr. William Vernon Harcourt (later Sir William) to Lady\r\n    Russell_\r\n\r\n    _September_ 28, 1863\r\n\r\n    I hope you will excuse my taking the liberty to write you a line of\r\n    admiration and satisfaction at Lord Russell's speech at Meiklour\r\n    [in Scotland], which I have just read. I take so deep and lively an\r\n    interest in the great American question and all that concerns it\r\n    that I looked forward to the authorized exposition of English\r\n    policy by the Foreign Secretary with the greatest anxiety. Lord\r\n    Russell's speech, will, I am sure, be of immense service both to\r\n    Europe and to America. It has the _juste milieu_, and withal\r\n    does not suppress the sympathy which every good man must feel for\r\n    the cause of freedom, in a manner which more than ever justifies\r\n    the Loch Katrine boatman's opinion of his \"terrible judgment.\"\r\n\r\n    I cannot help feeling that this speech has for the first time\r\n    publicly placed the position of England in its true light before\r\n    the world, and I with many another one am very grateful for it.\r\n    Among all Lord Russell's many titles to fame and to public\r\n    gratitude, the manner in which he has steered the vessel of the\r\n    State through the Scylla and Charybdis of the American War will, I\r\n    think, always stand conspicuous.... Now I am going to ask a great\r\n    favour. I saw at Minto a copy of verses written for the\r\n    summer-house at Pembroke Lodge, of which I formed the highest\r\n    opinion. May I have a copy of them? I should really be most\r\n    sincerely grateful and treasure them up amongst the things I really\r\n    value.\r\n\r\nThese are the lines referred to by Mr. Harcourt:\r\n\r\n    To J.R. PEMBROKE LODGE, _June_ 30, 1850\r\n\r\n      Here, statesman, rest, and while thy ranging sight\r\n      Drinks from old sources ever new delight\r\n      Unbind the weary shackles of the week,\r\n      And find the Sabbath thou art come to seek.\r\n      Here lay the babbling, lying Present by,\r\n      And Past and Future call to counsel high;\r\n      To Nature's worship say thy loud Amen,\r\n      And learn of solitude to mix with men.\r\n      Here hang on every rose a thorny care,\r\n      Bathe thy vexed soul in unpolluted air,\r\n      Fill deep from ancient stream and opening flower,\r\n      From veteran oak and wild melodious bower,\r\n      With love, with awe, the bright but fleeting hour.\r\n      Here bid the breeze that sweeps dull vapours by,\r\n      Leaving majestic clouds to deck the sky,\r\n      Fan from thy brow the lines unrest has wrought,\r\n      But leave the footprint of each nobler thought.\r\n      Now turn where high from Windsor's hoary walls,\r\n      To keep her flag unstained thy Sovereign calls;\r\n      Now wandering stop where wrapt in mantle dun,\r\n      As if her guilty head Heaven's light would shun,\r\n      London, gigantic parent, looks to thee,\r\n      Foremost of million sons her guide to be;\r\n      On the fair land in gladness now gaze round,\r\n      And wish thy name with hers in glory bound.\r\n      With one alone when fades the glowing West,\r\n      Beneath the moonbeam let thy spirit rest,\r\n      While childhood's silvery tones the stillness break\r\n      And all the echoes of thy heart awake.\r\n      Then wiser, holier, stronger than before,\r\n      Go, plunge into the maddening strife once more;\r\n      The dangerous, glorious path that thou hast trod,\r\n      Go, tread again, and with thy country's God.\r\n\r\n    F.R.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WOBURN ABBEY, _August_ 18, 1864\r\n\r\n    My dear, dear husband's birthday. [He was seventy-two.] I resolved\r\n    not to let sad and untrustful thoughts come in the way of gratitude\r\n    for present happiness, and oh! how thankfully I looked at him with\r\n    his children around him. They made him and me join them in a match\r\n    at trap-ball that lasted two hours and a half. He, the boys, Johnny\r\n    and Agatha rode, Mademoiselle and I drove in the same direction. He\r\n    and his cavalcade were a pleasant sight to me. He looked pleased\r\n    and proud with his three sons and his little daughter galloping\r\n    beside him. The day ended with merry games.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1864, came the news of Lord Amberley's engagement to Lord\r\nStanley of Alderley's daughter. He was at that time only twenty-one. Lady\r\nRussell's feeling about it is shown in the following letter:\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Georgiana Russell_\r\n\r\n    NORTH BERWICK, _September_ 21, 1864\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST GEORGY,--Your long and dear letters were a great\r\n    pleasure to me, showing how you are thinking and feeling with us\r\n    about this event, so great to us all. Whatever pangs there may be\r\n    belonging to it, and of course there are some, are lost and\r\n    swallowed up to me in great joy and gratitude. We might have wished\r\n    him to marry a little later, to have him a little longer a child of\r\n    home. But, on the other hand, there is something to me very\r\n    delightful in his marrying while heart and mind are fresh and\r\n    innocent and unworldly, and I even add inexperienced--for I am not\r\n    over-fond of experience. I think it just as often makes people less\r\n    wise as more wise. There is more real truth in their \"Ideale\" than\r\n    in what follows.... God bless you, dear child.\r\n\r\n    Your very loving MAMA\r\n\r\nIn July, 1865, Parliament was dissolved, the Ministry having held office\r\nfor six years. They had lost prestige over the Schleswig-Holstein\r\nnegotiations. Lord Derby, with justification, denounced their policy as one\r\nof \"meddle and muddle,\" and Palmerston only escaped a vote of censure in\r\nthe Commons by being able to point to the prodigious success of the\r\nMinistry's finance. His personal popularity and ascendancy, however, were\r\nas great as ever; the Liberals were returned by a majority of sixty-seven.\r\nAlthough this majority must have been more than they looked for, the\r\nelection disappointed Lord Russell in two respects: Gladstone lost his seat\r\nat Oxford and Lord Amberley was beaten at Leeds. Before Parliament met\r\nPalmerston fell seriously ill.\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _October_ 19, 1865\r\n\r\n    Letter from the Queen at Balmoral to John telling him she means to\r\n    ask him to carry on the Government in case of Lord Palmerston's\r\n    death. Dearest John very calm and without the oppressed look and\r\n    manner I always dread to see.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of October Palmerston died. Had he taken the precautions usual\r\nat the age of eighty, he might have lived longer, but in private as in\r\npublic life, he despised caution. He was one of those statesmen whom modern\r\ncritics, on the watch for the partially obsolete and with the complexity of\r\npresent problems always before them, tend to depreciate. He had the first\r\nquality which is necessary for popularity: he was readily intelligible. In\r\naddition he was prompt, combative, and magnanimous; shrewd, but never\r\nsubtle; sensible, but not imaginative. He had no ideas which he wished to\r\ncarry out; he did not like ideas. He wanted England to dominate in Europe\r\nand to use her power good-naturedly afterwards; to be, in fact, what a\r\nnobleman may be in his home-country, where he is universally looked up to\r\nand ready to take immense trouble to settle fairly disputes between\r\ninferiors. Opposition from a direction making it savour of impertinence he\r\nstamped upon at once, without imagining the provocation or ideas from which\r\nit might possibly spring; he could not understand, for instance, that there\r\nmight be two sides to the Chinese War. It is probable, too, that had not\r\nthe Prince Consort intervened to soften the asperity of the Government's\r\nprotest against the seizure of the Confederate emissaries on board the\r\n_Trent_, we should have had war with the Northern States. This\r\nmenacing, peremptory attitude in diplomacy served him well, till Bismarck\r\ncrossed his path. In the encounter between the man with a great idea to\r\ncarry out, who had taken the measure of the forces against him, and the man\r\nwho had only, as it were, a dignified attitude to support in the eyes of\r\nEurope, the odds were uneven, and Palmerston was beaten.\r\n\r\nLord Russell, though he must have been among the few who knew the Prime\r\nMinister had been failing lately, writes that his death came with a shock\r\nof surprise, he was so full of heart and health to the last.\r\n\r\nLord Russell now became Prime Minister, and Lord Clarendon took his place\r\nat the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _November_ 2, 1865\r\n\r\n    John to town at twelve, back at half-past five, having taken leave\r\n    of the dear old Foreign Office and left Lord Clarendon there.\r\n    Happy, happy days, so full of reality--the hours of work so\r\n    cheerfully got through, the hours of leisure so delightful.\r\n    Sometimes when I walk with my dear, dear husband and see my lovely\r\n    Agatha bounding along with sparkling eyes and rosy cheeks, and the\r\n    bright sun shining on the red and yellow trees, I can only feel the\r\n    sunshine of life and forget its autumn leaves. Or when we sit\r\n    together by our evening fire and talk, as our moods or fancies lead\r\n    us, of things grave or gay, trifling or solemn, my heart seems to\r\n    leap within me from the sense of happiness, and I can only utter\r\n    silent and humble thanks to the Almighty Giver. It must end, oh,\r\n    fearful thought!--parting and death must come; fearfully yet not\r\n    despairingly I think of that end. Come when or how it will, it\r\n    cannot take all away--this happiness, this unutterable gratitude is\r\n    not for time only, but is mine for ever.\r\n\r\nThe succession of Lord Russell to Palmerston's place at the head of the\r\nGovernment implied a change in its character and policy. It was not merely\r\na continuation of an old, but practically the formation of a new\r\nGovernment. Lord Russell was bent upon introducing a Reform Bill, and thus\r\nclosing his career in forwarding the cause in which he had won his earliest\r\nand most famous laurels, and for which he had on two other occasions\r\nstriven without success. But though the country was now in a mood for such\r\nmeasures, and Gladstone's speeches in favour of an extension of the\r\nfranchise had been well received, the party which had been elected in\r\nsupport of Palmerston was largely composed of men who shared his\r\nindifference, if not his dislike, to all such proposals. In all probability\r\nthe Ministry was therefore doomed to a short life. \"Palmerston,\" wrote Lord\r\nClarendon to Lord Granville, \"held a great bundle of sticks together. They\r\nare now loosened and there is nobody to tie them up.\" [58] In any case such\r\na Bill would require very careful steering. The first ominous sign of a\r\nsplit occurred when it became necessary to fill the vacancy caused by the\r\nretirement of Sir Charles Wood. A place in the Cabinet was offered to Mr.\r\nLowe, but he refused on the ground that he could not support Reform. Lord\r\nRussell, with characteristic abruptness and without consulting his\r\ncolleagues, then offered the place to Mr. Goschen, who was quite unknown to\r\nthe public; he had only been three years in Parliament, and held a\r\nsubordinate office. [59] The choice was an admirable one, but to those who\r\nhad not read Mr. Goschen's book upon Foreign Exchanges the appointment\r\nmight well seem inexplicable.\r\n\r\n[58] \"Life of Lord Granville,\" by Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice.\r\n\r\n[59] Promotion so rapid has only occurred once or twice in Parliamentary\r\nhistory. See note, Morley's \"Life of Gladstone,\" vol. ii, p. 156.\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _February_ 3, 1866\r\n\r\n    Sir Charles Wood [60] called--wished to see me alone--chiefly in\r\n    order to talk about John, his occasional sudden acts without\r\n    consulting colleagues, and the bad effect of so acting. He gave\r\n    some instances, in which he was quite mistaken, some in which he\r\n    was right. The subject was a difficult one for me--but his\r\n    intentions were very kind, and as I heartily agree with him in the\r\n    main, we got on very well, and as a wife I was glad to have the\r\n    opportunity of saying some things of my dearest, dearest John, who\r\n    is not always understood. Sir Charles took my hand, kissed it, and\r\n    said: \"God bless you.\"\r\n\r\n[60] Sir Charles Wood retired with the title of Lord Halifax.\r\n\r\nEarly in March Lady Russell writes to her son Rollo, at Harrow, of a very\r\nagreeable evening at Chesham Place, when Mr. Froude and Mr. Bright were\r\namong her guests.\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Mr. Rollo Russell_\r\n\r\n    _March_ 1, 1866\r\n\r\n    I wish you had been here at the Friday dinner.... It was such a\r\n    pleasant little dinner. Bright was between Johnny and me; ... his\r\n    conversation is interesting; he is warm hearted and very much in\r\n    earnest. We talked of Milton, Shakespeare, and poetry in general;\r\n    he has intense admiration for Milton, as a man and as a poet, as he\r\n    ought to have; but agreed with me that it is less improbable that\r\n    the world should produce another Milton than another Shakespeare.\r\n    He said reading poetry was the next to the greatest pleasure he had\r\n    in life--the greatest was little children. These refined and\r\n    amiable tastes are not what the common world would attribute to\r\n    Bright, who is better known for determination and pugnacity.\r\n\r\nAlthough Lord Russell and Lord Derby were the two leaders of their\r\nrespective parties, they were no longer the principal men on either side.\r\nThe centre of interest lay in the House of Commons, and Gladstone and\r\nDisraeli were now the antagonists whom everybody watched. On March 12th the\r\nGovernment's Reform Bill was introduced in a speech by Gladstone, which was\r\nchiefly remarkable for lacking his usual fervour. The cause of this want of\r\nardour on his part lay in the nature of the Bill itself. In order to\r\nconciliate the apathetic or hostile section of the party, the Cabinet,\r\nagainst the advice of Lord Russell and the inclinations of Gladstone had\r\nseparated the franchise question from their redistribution scheme, which\r\nought to have been an integral part of any Reform Bill capable of meeting\r\nthe needs of the country. The grievances which such a Bill would aim at\r\nmitigating, although less gigantic than those which called for removal at\r\nthe time of the first Reform Bill, were still serious enough. In 1865\r\n\"there was not one elector for each four inhabited houses, and five out of\r\nevery six adult males were without a vote.\" [61] But in addition to this\r\nthe large increase in population had been very unevenly distributed, with\r\nthe result that large towns like Liverpool were palpably under-represented.\r\nThe franchise had been fixed by the first Reform Bill at £10 a year rental.\r\nThe Bill which Gladstone brought forward in the Commons proposed to reduce\r\nthe county franchise from £50 to £14, and the borough franchise from £10 to\r\n£7 rental. Gladstone wished to make the payment of rates qualify a man for\r\na vote; but this change was thought to be too radical, and any lowering of\r\nthe qualifying sum of £7 rental would, it was found, place the\r\nworking-classes in command of a majority in the towns--a result which the\r\nCabinet was not ready to face. Moderate as the measure was, it was received\r\nwith bitter hostility, while its half-heartedness roused little enthusiasm\r\namong the keener Liberals of the party. The debates upon the first and\r\nsecond readings were remarkable for energy of attack from the disaffected\r\nsection of the old Palmerstonian party, nicknamed the \"Adullamites.\" Mr.\r\nLowe's speeches from \"the cave of Adullam,\" \"to which every one was invited\r\nwho was distressed, and every one who was discontented,\" are still [62]\r\nremembered as among the most eloquent ever delivered in the House of\r\nCommons. The second reading passed by so narrow a majority that the\r\nGovernment thought it prudent to rally their reliable supporters, and meet\r\njust criticisms upon the inadequacy of their Bill, by bringing forward a\r\nredistribution measure and incorporating it with their franchise proposals.\r\nFor a time this served to help them. By declaring that they would also\r\nstand or fall by the redistribution clauses of their Bill, they at any rate\r\nshowed a better front to the Opposition. Towards the end of June, however,\r\nthey were beaten in committee by eleven; their defeat being principally due\r\nto the attacks and manoeuvres of Mr. Lowe and Mr. Horsman, who had been\r\nIrish Secretary in Palmerston's first Ministry.\r\n\r\n[61] Spencer Walpole, \"The History of Twenty-five Years.\"\r\n\r\n[62] John Bright's speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to her two sons at Harrow_\r\n\r\n    _March_ 15, 1866\r\n\r\n    ...Horsman and Lowe are both Liberals; Horsman used, I think, to be\r\n    reckoned Radical. But both have taken a violent dislike to\r\n    Parliamentary Reform, and certainly one would not guess by their\r\n    speeches that they were liberal in anything. Mr. Lowe's was a very\r\n    clever speech; Bright's very clever too, and very good. Of course\r\n    the Bill does not satisfy him; but his honest support of it, being\r\n    all in the right direction, is creditable to him and very useful to\r\n    the measure. Your Papa is much pleased with the whole debate,\r\n    thinking it a very good one (excellent speeches for and against the\r\n    measure), and the result probably favourable to it. As to the\r\n    likelihood of its passing, opinions vary. I hear that Lord Eversley\r\n    (the late Speaker) says he would take a good big bet that it won't\r\n    pass. Your Papa says he is ready to bet against him that it will.\r\n    Will Ministers dissolve Parliament if beaten? To that I must answer\r\n    I don't know. I heard Mr. Gladstone's speech. As Willy says, the\r\n    latter part was very eloquent. It was all good; but the details of\r\n    a Suffrage Act are tiresome, and the apparent indifference, or even\r\n    apathy, of our side of the House allowed even the striking passages\r\n    with which the speech was interspersed to fall dead. The passages\r\n    were striking, but nobody seemed to be struck. I don't believe the\r\n    real feeling is one of dislike to Reform; but that, of course, they\r\n    don't like to show, as the greater part of them, in spite of\r\n    dislike, will support it. Your classical hearts must have enjoyed\r\n    Mr. Gladstone's \"ligneus equus\" quotation; but I am afraid Mr.\r\n    Lowe's continuation was better. I never, or seldom, like quotations\r\n    that merely illustrate what the subject of discussion does\r\n    _not_ resemble--they are forced and without much point; but\r\n    when Mr. Lowe _likens_ our Reform Bill to the \"monstrum\r\n    infelix,\" and hopes it will not succeed in penetrating the \"muros\"\r\n    of the Constitution (isn't that pretty nearly what he said?) there\r\n    is wit and point in the quotation. [63]\r\n\r\n[63] Gladstone, in his apologetic introductory speech, had declared that no\r\none could regard the Bill as a Trojan horse, which the Government was\r\nintroducing surreptitiously within the citadel of the Constitution. \"We\r\ncannot say:\r\n\r\n  \"'Scandit fatalis machina muros\r\n  Foeta armis.'\"\r\n  (The fated engine climbs our walls, big with arms.)\r\n\r\nMr. Lowe retorted:\r\n\r\n    \"That was not a very apt quotation; but there was a curious\r\n    felicity about it which he [Mr. Gladstone] little dreamt of. The\r\n    House remembers that, among other proofs of the degree in which\r\n    public opinion is enlisted in the cause of Reform, is this--that\r\n    this is now the fifth Reform Bill which has been brought in since\r\n    1851. Now, just attend to the sequel of the passage quoted by the\r\n    right honourable gentleman:\r\n\r\n    \"'O Divum domus Ilium et inclyta bello\r\n    Mcenia Dardanidum! Quater ipso in limine portae\r\n    Sustitit, atque utero sonitum quater arma dedere.'\r\n    (O Troy, house of gods and Dardanian city famous in war! four times in\r\n    the very gateway it stood, and four times the clash of arms sounded\r\n    in its womb.)\r\n\r\n    \"But that is not all:\r\n\r\n    \"'Instamus tarn en immemores, caecique furore,\r\n    Et monstrum infelix sacrata sistimus arce.'\r\n    (Yet we, thoughtless and blind with enthusiasm, urged it on, and in our\r\n    hallowed citadel stationed the ill-omened monster.)\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Charles Dickens to Lady Russell_\r\n\r\n    GLASGOW, _April_ 17, 1866\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR LADY RUSSELL,--...In sending my kindest regards to Lord\r\n    Russell, let me congratulate you on the culminating victory before\r\n    him, and on the faith and constancy with which the country carries\r\n    him in its great heart. I have never felt so certain of any public\r\n    event as I have been from the first that the national honour would\r\n    feel itself stung to the quick if he were in danger of being\r\n    deserted....\r\n\r\n    Dear Lady Russell,\r\n\r\n    Ever faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n    CHARLES DICKENS\r\n\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _April_ 19, 1866\r\n\r\n    Political prospects not brightening. John and his Ministry will be\r\n    in such an honourable position, whether they stand or fall, that no\r\n    serious danger threatens the country if they fall. My only anxiety\r\n    is lest John should be disappointed and depressed; and it was with\r\n    a sense of relief of which he was little aware that I heard him say\r\n    yesterday of his own accord, as he looked out of window at the\r\n    bright sunshine, \"I shall not be very sorry--it's such fine weather\r\n    to go out in.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _June_ 19, 1866\r\n\r\n    At 7.30 a note was brought to John from Mr. Gladstone. Government\r\n    beaten by eleven. Happily Gladstone, though ambiguous in one\r\n    sentence as to the importance of the vote, was not so in others--or\r\n    at all events was understood to mean \"stand or fall.\"\r\n\r\n    Cabinet at 2.30 resolved that John should write to the Queen to\r\n    offer resignations. Queen meantime writes from Balmoral, foreseeing\r\n    the defeat, that she will not accept the resignations.\r\n\r\n    Dearest John not depressed, though very sorry for this defeat of\r\n    his hopes. He will stand well with the country, and that he feels.\r\n\r\nThe Queen could not understand the necessity of her Ministers' resignation.\r\nThe amendment upon which they had been defeated by so small a majority\r\nseemed to her a matter of small importance compared with events which made\r\ncontinuance in office desirable. For Bismarck had just declared war upon\r\nAustria, and the failure of Overend and Gurney had thrown the City into\r\nconfusion. After a delay of more than a week, however, she was compelled to\r\naccept their resignations, which had been tendered as early as June 19th.\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _June_ 28, 1866\r\n\r\n    John so well and happy that my joy in his release becomes greater\r\n    every hour. There is a sense of repose that can hardly be\r\n    described--abounding happiness in his honourable downfall that\r\n    cannot be uttered.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _June_ 30, 1866\r\n\r\n    As I wrote to you last in a doubting and disagreeable state of\r\n    mind, I am in a hurry to write again, being now perfectly certain\r\n    that the blessings of the resignation far outweigh its pains. I do\r\n    not care for the charge of fickleness which may with justice be\r\n    made against me. I can only confirm it. The defeat made me very\r\n    sad. I hoped for many days that John could honourably remain in\r\n    office.... On the day of the resignation he was serious--perhaps\r\n    sad--and so was I. The next day everything, including his face,\r\n    looked brighter, and has gone on brightening; so that now I am only\r\n    afraid of being too much uplifted by our downfall, and hardly have\r\n    words enough to describe my relief and joy. All the best men are\r\n    full of approbation of his conduct. He and Mr. Gladstone have given\r\n    an example to the country worth more than a Reform Bill. A short\r\n    Tory reign will strengthen the Whig party; a good strong Whig\r\n    Opposition will prevent much Tory mischief, so that there is little\r\n    regret on public grounds to mix with my unbounded joy on our\r\n    private account. Seven years of office had made me aware of its\r\n    advantages and its interest, and I saw that John liked it, and I\r\n    thought I did; but now I see that he has had enough of it, and any\r\n    fear I may have had that he might regret it is for ever gone, and I\r\n    have found out how entirely it was an acquired taste with me. I\r\n    can't say how often we have already said to one another, \"Now that\r\n    we are out,\" as a preface to something pleasant to be done. He said\r\n    to me this morning, \"The days will not be long enough now.\" That\r\n    \"now\" would surprise those people who may imagine that time will\r\n    hang heavy on his hands. He is in excellent spirits.... We feel as\r\n    if fetters had been struck off our minds and bodies. If God grants\r\n    us health, how happy we may be, dearest Mary! I have said far too\r\n    much on this subject, but you will understand how I have reason to\r\n    be both sadder and gladder than other Ministers' wives.\r\n\r\nPrussia and Italy had declared war against Austria, Hanover, Bavaria, and\r\nHesse on the day the Russell Government was defeated. At Custozza the\r\nItalians were badly beaten by the Austrians, under the Archduke Charles.\r\n\r\n    Alas, alas! for poor Italy! Alas for everybody engaged in this most\r\n    wicked and terrible German war! Surely it is all wrong that two or\r\n    three bad, ambitious--men should be able to cause the death and\r\n    misery of thousands upon thousands. Our day at Harrow, Agatha with\r\n    us, was very happy. I never had heard John so heartily cheered by\r\n    the boys.\r\n\r\nHe was in his seventy-fourth year, and he was never again to bear the cares\r\nof office. That summer they went down to Endsleigh, which they had not\r\nvisited since the first years of their marriage,\r\n\r\n    ENDSLEIGH, _August_ 4, 1866\r\n\r\n    John, Georgy, and I here about 7.30, after a beautiful journey.\r\n    Lovely Endsleigh! it is like a dream to be here.... Thoughts of the\r\n    old happy days haunting me continually. To church, to Fairy Dell.\r\n    Places all the same--everything else altered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n1866-70\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring 1866 Lord Russell finished his \"Life of Fox.\" In the autumn and\r\nwinter he and his family travelled in Italy, where they were often\r\n_fêted_ by the people of the towns through which they passed. At the\r\nclose of the seven weeks' war Austria had ceded Venetia to Italy, and on\r\nNovember 7th they witnessed the entry of Victor Emmanuel into Venice as\r\nKing of all Italy. It was a magnificent and most impressive sight. Lord\r\nRussell was full of thankfulness and joy at the deliverance of Venetia from\r\nforeign rule, and the triumph of a free and united Italy.\r\n\r\nIn the memoir of Count Pasolini by his son (translated by the Countess of\r\nDalhousie) the following passage occurs:\r\n\r\nLord John Russell was then in Venice, and came to view the pageant from our\r\nwindows in Palazzo Corner. When my mother saw this old friend appear with\r\nthe tricolor upon his breast, she said, \"Fort bien, Milord! nos couleurs\r\nitaliennes sur votre coeur!\" He shook her by the hand, and answered, \"Pour\r\nmoi je les ai toujours portées, Comtesse. Je suis bien content de vous\r\ntrouver ici aujourd'hui; c'est un des plus beaux jours de notre siècle!\"\r\n\r\nSomebody then said to Lord Russell what a pity it was that the sun of Italy\r\ndid not shine more brightly to gild the historical solemnity. \"As for\r\nthat,\" said he, \"England shows her sympathy by sending you her beloved fog\r\nfrom the Thames.\"\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_\r\n\r\n    VENICE, November 8, 1866\r\n\r\n    We are all enchanted with this enchanting place.... Thursday\r\n    (yesterday) was the grand and glorious sight--_how_ grand and\r\n    glorious nobody who has not been here and probably nobody who has\r\n    can conceive.... Newspapers will tell you of the countless gondolas\r\n    decorated with every variety of brilliant colours--alike only in\r\n    the tricolor flag waving from every one of them--and rowed by\r\n    gondoliers in every variety of brilliant and picturesque garb--and\r\n    they will tell you a great deal more; but they cannot describe the\r\n    _thrill_ of thousands and thousands of Italian hearts at the\r\n    moment when their King, \"il sospirato nostro Re,\" appeared, the\r\n    winged Lion of St. Mark at one end of his magnificent gondola, a\r\n    statue of Italy crowned by Venice at the other. So spirit-stirring\r\n    a celebration of so great an event we shall never see again, and I\r\n    rejoice that our children were there.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord Russell to Lady Minto_\r\n\r\n    VENICE, _November_ 11, 1866\r\n\r\n    ... We have been delighted with this place, but especially with\r\n    being here to see the crowning of the edifice of Italian\r\n    Independence. The people have rather their hearts full than their\r\n    voices loud. When the Italian flag was first raised none of the\r\n    crowd could cheer for weeping and sobbing. It is a mighty\r\n    change.... We have seen many pictures. I am exceedingly struck with\r\n    the number of fine pictures, the magnificent colouring, and the\r\n    large conceptions of the Venetian painters--faulty in drawing very\r\n    often, as Michelangelo said long ago, but wonderfully satisfying to\r\n    the imagination.\r\n\r\nThey returned to England early in 1867.\r\n\r\nIt was a critical time in the history of the franchise. Neither Lord Derby\r\nnor his followers liked Reform, but the workmen of England were at last set\r\nupon it, and Disraeli realized that only a party prepared to enlarge the\r\nfranchise had any chance of power. Unlike his colleagues, he had no fear or\r\ndislike of the people. His imagination enabled him to foresee what hardly\r\nanother statesman, Conservative or Radical, supposed possible, that the\r\npower of the Democracy might be increased without kindling in the people\r\nany desire to use it. He divined that the glamour which wealth and riches\r\nhave for the majority of voters would make it easy to put a hook in the\r\nnose of Leviathan, and that the monster might be ultimately taken in tow by\r\nthe Conservative party. His first move in the process of \"educating his\r\nparty\" was to offer the House a series of Resolutions upon the principles\r\nof representation. These were intended to foreshadow the nature of the\r\nGovernment's proposals and also to prepare their way. By this device he\r\nhoped to raise the Bill above party conflict, and to lead the more\r\nConservative of his followers up a gently graduated slope of generalities\r\ntill they found themselves committed to accepting a somewhat democratic\r\nmeasure. His plan was frustrated by the determination of the Opposition to\r\nforce the Government to show their hand at once.\r\n\r\nHe consequently placed before his colleagues a measure which based the\r\nfranchise on the occupation of houses rated at £5, coupled with several\r\nantidotes to the democratic tendencies of such a change in the shape of\r\n\"fancy franchises,\" which gave votes to men of certain educational and\r\nfinancial qualifications. His proposals seem to have been accepted by the\r\nCabinet with reluctant and hesitating approval. On examining more carefully\r\nthe effects of the £5 franchise upon town constituencies Lord Cranborne\r\n(afterwards Lord Salisbury) retracted his previous assent, and Lord\r\nCarnarvon followed his lead.\r\n\r\nOn the very day that Lord Derby and Disraeli were pledged to define their\r\nmeasure they found themselves threatened with the resignation of two most\r\nimportant members of the Government. At a hasty Cabinet Council, held just\r\nbefore they were to speak, it was agreed, after about twenty minutes'\r\ndiscussion, that the borough rental should be raised to £6. The Opposition,\r\nhowever, declared a £6 franchise to be still too high, and they were now\r\nbacked by a considerable section of the Conservative party itself, who felt\r\nthat when once they were committed to Reform it would at least be wise to\r\nintroduce a measure likely to win them popularity as reformers. Lord Derby\r\nand Disraeli yielded to pressure from within their party, and Lord\r\nCranborne, Lord Carnarvon, and General Peel resigned. The subsequent\r\nhistory of the Bill consisted in a series of surrenders on the part of\r\nDisraeli. All the clauses and qualifications which had originally modified\r\nits democratic character were dropped, and Gladstone succeeded in carrying\r\nnearly all the amendments his first speech upon the Bill had suggested.\r\n\r\nWhen the Bill finally passed Lord Salisbury described it as a measure based\r\nupon the principles of Bright and dictated by Gladstone; and what many\r\nConservatives thought of Disraeli's conduct is reflected in the speeches of\r\ntheir ally Lowe: \"Never, never was tergiversation so complete. Such conduct\r\nmay fail or not; it may lead to the retention or loss of office; but it\r\nmerits alike the contempt of all honest men and the execration of\r\nposterity.\" [64] Gladstone, writing to Dr. Pusey at the end of the year,\r\nsaid: \"We have been passing through a strange, eventful year: a deplorable\r\none, I think, for the character and conduct of the House of Commons; but\r\nyet one of promise for the country, though of a promise not unmixed with\r\nevils.\" The feeling of romantic Tories in the country is expressed in\r\nCoventry Patmore's poem \"1867,\" which begins:\r\n\r\n  In the year of the great crime,\r\n  When the false English Nobles and their Jew,\r\n  By God demented, slew\r\n  The Trust they stood twice pledged to keep from wrong.\r\n\r\n[64] Morley's \"Life of Gladstone,\" vol. ii, p. 235.\r\n\r\nThe last and longest struggle took place over the compound householder. On\r\nMay 17th Mr. Hodgkinson proposed and carried an amendment that in a\r\nParliamentary borough only the occupier should be rated, thus basing, in\r\neffect, the franchise upon household suffrage, and forcing upon Disraeli a\r\nprinciple which he had begun by announcing he would never accept. To make\r\nthe following letters intelligible it is only necessary to add that in 1866\r\nLord Amberley had been returned to Parliament as Radical member for\r\nNottingham:\r\n\r\n    _Lord Russell to Lady Georgiana Russell_ [65]\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _January_ 22, 1867\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST GEORGY,--I have been very negligent in not writing to\r\n    you before, as I meant to do, but laziness after exertion is very\r\n    pleasant. My exertion was not small, as, besides speaking at the\r\n    beginning of the evening, I sate up for the division, and did not\r\n    get home till near four in the morning. The triumph was very great;\r\n    Derby and Cairns and the foolish and wicked Tories were beat, and\r\n    the wise and honest Tories, like Salisbury and Carnarvon, helped\r\n    the Liberals to defeat them.... We shall have a great fight in\r\n    Committee; but I still trust in a reasonable majority for not\r\n    pushing amendments too far, and then the Bill will be a great\r\n    triumph of sense over nonsense.... We had Dickens Saturday and\r\n    Sunday--very agreeable and amiable....\r\n\r\n    Your affectionate father, R.\r\n\r\n[65] This letter ought to be dated July 22, 1869, and addressed to\r\nLady Georgiana Peel. It refers to the debate on the Irish Church Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Mr. Rollo Russell_\r\n\r\n    37 CHESHAM PLACE, BELGRAVE SQUARE, S.W.,\r\n\r\n    _February 21, 1867_\r\n\r\n    ... Your Papa and I dined yesterday with Lord and Lady Cork. I\r\n    heard some funny stories of Mrs. Lowe.... Here's the best. Mr. Lowe\r\n    was talking of the marriage service, of the absurdity of making\r\n    everybody say, \"With all my worldly goods I thee endow\"--\"For\r\n    instance, I had not a penny.\" _Mrs. L_.: \"Oh, but Robert, you\r\n    had your brains!\" _Mr. L. (sharply)_: \"I'm sure I didn't endow\r\n    you with _them_.\" Very funny; but very cruel, too, in answer\r\n    to what was meant so affectionately.... Now, I must get ready to\r\n    walk with your Papa. He keeps well and strong, in spite of the\r\n    cloudy political atmosphere (hazy, perhaps, rather than\r\n    cloudy)--nobody thinking or feeling anything clearly or warmly,\r\n    except him and Gladstone and a score or two of others. He feels\r\n    that the Government has so discredited itself and the Tory party\r\n    generally, that the Whig party might be in a capital position if it\r\n    chose. But the general indifference of Whig M.P.'s to Reform, and\r\n    their selfish fear of dissolution, come in the way of public spirit\r\n    and combined action.\r\n\r\n    Your Papa is writing to Mr. Gladstone, from whom he has just\r\n    received an account of the debate. Disraeli's clever and artful\r\n    speech appears to have had more effect on the House (and even on\r\n    our side of it) than is creditable.... Johnny has made a very good\r\n    impression--so we hear from Mr. Brand, Hastings, [66] Mr.\r\n    Huguesson, and Gladstone--by his maiden speech. All these, except\r\n    Gladstone, heard it, and concur in warm praise, both of matter and\r\n    manner. It is a great event in his life, and I am so thankful it is\r\n    well over.\r\n\r\n[66] Afterwards Duke of Bedford.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord Russell to Lady Minto_\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _May 21_, 1867\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR NINA,--As you have been so much bothered with the compound\r\n    householder, you will be glad to learn that he is dead and is to be\r\n    buried on Thursday. It was supposed he was the last and best\r\n    product of civilization; but it has been found out that he was a\r\n    son of Old Nick, and a valiant knight of the name of Hodgkinson has\r\n    run him through the body.\r\n\r\n    The Duke of Buccleuch, with whom Fanny and I have been having\r\n    luncheon, says that Dizzy is like a clever conjuror. \"Is that the\r\n    card you wished for, sir?-and is that yours, and yours, and yours?\"\r\n    But politics are rather disgusting than otherwise. ...

However, nothing is too much for the swallow of our modern\r\nTories.\"\r\n\r\nIn August, 1867, Lord Russell's eldest daughter, Georgiana, married Mr.\r\nArchibald Peel, [68] son of General Peel, and nephew of the statesman, Sir\r\nRobert Peel.\r\n\r\n[68] The marriage service was at Petersham, in the quaint old village\r\nChurch, hallowed by many sacred memories.\r\n\r\nThe daughters, who had now left the old home, were sadly missed, but\r\nintimate and affectionate intercourse with them never ceased. Lady\r\nRussell's own daughter, the youngest of three families--ten in all--thought\r\nin her early childhood that they were all real brothers and sisters, a\r\nstriking proof of the harmonious happiness of the home. In November, 1867,\r\nLady Victoria Villiers wrote to Lady Russell: \"How I long to make our home\r\nas pure, as high in its tone and aims, as free from all that is low or even\r\nuseless for our children, as our dear home was to us.\"\r\n\r\nOn Lord Russell's birthday, August 18, 1867, Lady Russell wrote in her\r\ndiary:\r\n\r\n    My dear, dear husband's birthday. Each year, each day, makes me\r\n    feel more deeply all the wonderful goodness of God in giving me one\r\n    so noble, so gentle, so loving, to be my example, my happiness, my\r\n    stay. How often his strength makes me feel, but try to conquer, my\r\n    own weakness; how often his cheerfulness and calmness are a\r\n    reproach to my anxieties. Experience has not hardened but only\r\n    given him wisdom. Trials have taught him to feel for others; age\r\n    has deepened his religion of love. All that so often lowers\r\n    commoner natures has but raised his.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1868, Lord Derby resigned, owing to ill health. \"With Lord\r\nDerby [says Sir Spencer Walpole [69]] a whole race of statesmen\r\ndisappeared. He was the last of the Prime Ministers who had held high\r\noffice before the Reform Act of 1832; and power, on his fall, was to be\r\ntransferred to men not much younger in point of years, but whose characters\r\nand opinions had been moulded by other influences. He was, moreover, the\r\nlast of the Tories. He had, indeed, by his own concluding action made\r\nToryism impossible; for, in 1867, he had thrown the ramparts of Toryism\r\ninto a heap, and had himself mounted the structure and fired the funeral\r\npile.\" Disraeli succeeded him as Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n[69] \"The History of Twenty-five Years,\" vol. ii, p. 287.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Mr. Rollo Russell_\r\n\r\n    CHESHAM PLACE, _February_ 18, 1868\r\n\r\n    ...Lord Derby is supposed to be dying, I am sorry to say. It is\r\n    horrible to hear the street criers bawling out in their catchpenny\r\n    voices, \"Serious illness of Lord Derby.\" I feel for his wife and\r\n    all belonging to him without any of the flutter and anxiety about\r\n    your father which a probable change of Ministry would have caused a\r\n    few years ago. He will never accept office again. This is right, I\r\n    know, and I am thankful that on the conviction of its being so he\r\n    has calmly made up his mind--yet there is deep sadness in it. The\r\n    newspapers are not favourable to his pamphlets on Ireland [three\r\n    pamphlets published together afterwards under the title, \"A letter\r\n    to the Right Hon. Chichester Fortescue\"]. He does not care much\r\n    about this, provided men in Parliament adopt his views or something\r\n    like them.\r\n\r\n    We find London very sociable and pleasant ... people all looking\r\n    glad to meet, and fresh and pleasant from their country life, quite\r\n    different from what they will be in July....\r\n\r\nLady Russell, as well as her husband, was always anxious to encourage\r\nperfect freedom and independence of thought in her children. The following\r\npassages are from a letter to her daughter on her fifteenth birthday:\r\n\r\n    37 CHESHAM PLACE, _March_ 28, 1868\r\n\r\n    ... Every day will now bring you more independence of mind, more\r\n    capacity to understand, not merely to adopt the thoughts of others,\r\n    to reason and to form opinions of your own. I am the more sure of\r\n    this, that yours is a thoughtful and reflective mind. The voice of\r\n    God may sometimes sound differently to you from what it sounds even\r\n    to your father or to me; if so, never be afraid to say so--never\r\n    close your mind against any but bad thoughts; for although we are\r\n    all one in as far as we all partake of God's spirit, which is the\r\n    breath of life, still the communion of each soul with Him is, and\r\n    must be, for that soul alone.... Nothing great is easy, and the\r\n    greatest and most difficult of all things is to overcome\r\n    ourselves.... Life is short, and we do well to remember it, but\r\n    each moment is eternal, and we do still better to remember that....\r\n    Heaven bless you and guide you through the pleasures and\r\n    perplexities, the sorrows and the joys, of this strange and\r\n    beautiful world, to the source of all light, and life, and\r\n    goodness, to that Being whose highest name is Love.\r\n\r\nThe everlasting Irish question had been coming again to the front. During\r\n1867 the Fenians had attempted to get the grievances of Ireland redressed\r\nby adopting violent measures. There had been an attempt upon the arsenal at\r\nChester, numerous outrages in Ireland, an attack at Manchester upon the\r\nprison van, in which two Fenian leaders were being taken to prison, and a\r\nsubsequent attempt to blow up Clerkenwell jail. The crisis had been met by\r\nsuspending the Habeas Corpus Act in Ireland. Lord Russell, when Prime\r\nMinister, had replaced Sir Robert Peel, as Chief Secretary, by Mr.\r\nChichester Fortescue, who later received the same office from Mr.\r\nGladstone. In February, 1868, Lord Russell published his letter to Mr.\r\nFortescue advocating Disestablishment in Ireland, but declaring himself in\r\nfavour of endowing the Catholic Church with part of the revenues of the\r\ndisestablished Church. In April Gladstone succeeded in carrying three\r\nResolutions against the Government on the Irish Church question, and though\r\nDisraeli tendered his resignation, dissolution was postponed until the\r\nautumn. The same month Lord Russell presided at a meeting in St. James's\r\nHall in support of Disestablishment. At the general election in the autumn\r\nthe Liberals came in with a large majority; Gladstone became Prime\r\nMinister, and in the following year carried his Bill for the\r\nDisestablishment of the Irish Church. [70] Lady Russell's views on the\r\nquestion of Church and State are shown in the following letter:\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _May_ 20, 1868\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST MARY,--...How can one write letters in such weather as\r\n    we have had? A fine May is surely the loveliest of lovely things,\r\n    and the most enjoyable, at least to lucky mortals like ourselves\r\n    who are not obliged to be \"in populous city pent\"--and those who\r\n    have never seen Pemmy Lodge in its May garments of lilac, laburnum,\r\n    wild hyacinth, hawthorn, and the tender greens of countless shades\r\n    on trees and shrubs, are not really acquainted with it.... I have\r\n    been going through the contrary change from you as regards Church\r\n    and State. I thought _I_ was strongly for the connection (at\r\n    least of _a_ Church with the State, certainly not _the_\r\n    Church of England as it now is), but reflection on what the history\r\n    of our State Churches has been, the speeches in St. James's Hall of\r\n    the Bishops fostered by the State, and Arthur Stanley's pamphlet,\r\n    which says the best that _can_ be said for connection, and yet\r\n    seems to open my eyes to the fallacy of that best, and the\r\n    conversations I hear, have opened my eyes to the bad principle at\r\n    the very root of a State Church. If _all_ who call themselves\r\n    teachers of religion could be paid, it might be very well, best of\r\n    all perhaps; but I'm afraid there are difficulties not to be got\r\n    over, and the objections to the voluntary system diminish on\r\n    reflection.... This new political crisis raises John's hopes a\r\n    little; but he has small faith in the public spirit of the Liberal\r\n    party, and even now fears some manoeuvre to keep Dizzy in.\r\n\r\n    Ever, dearest Mary, your most affectionate sister,\r\n\r\n    F. RUSSELL\r\n\r\n[70] Mr. Froude, in a talk with an Irish peasant on the grievances\r\nof his country, remarked that one cause of complaint was removed by\r\nDisestablishment of the Church. \"Och, sure, your honour, that is\r\nworse than all. It was the best gravance we had, and ye've taken it\r\naway from us!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _December_ 3, 1868\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST MARY,--Yesterday's _Pall Mall_ and Sir David\r\n    Dundas, who dined with us, set us all agog with the news that the\r\n    Ministry are to resign at once, probably have now resigned;\r\n    certainly much the wisest course for themselves, and John rather\r\n    thinks the best for everybody.... How different this change of\r\n    Ministry is to us from any there has been before since we were\r\n    married, and for John since long before! There is now only a keen\r\n    and wholesome interest for the country's sake--none of the\r\n    countless agitations which at all events on the formation of the\r\n    three last Ministries, of which John was either the head or a\r\n    prominent member, more than overpowered satisfaction and pride,\r\n    perhaps not to himself, but to his wife in her secret heart. As to\r\n    pride, I never was prouder of him in one position than in another,\r\n    _in_ than _out_, applauded than condemned; and I had\r\n    learned to know the risks, not to health only or chiefly, for that,\r\n    precious as it was, seemed a trifle in comparison with other\r\n    things, but to the power of serving his country, to friendship, to\r\n    reputation in the highest sense, which are involved in the\r\n    formation of a Government. These are matters of experience, and in\r\n    1846 I was inexperienced and consequently foresaw only good to the\r\n    country and increase of fame to him from his acceptance of the\r\n    Prime Ministership. I now know that these seldom or never in such a\r\n    state of parties as has existed for many years and still exists,\r\n    can be the _only_ consequences of high office for him,\r\n    although, thank God, they have always been _among_ the\r\n    consequences, and my only reasonable and permanent regret (for I\r\n    don't pretend to the absence of passing and unreasonable regrets)\r\n    is for the _cause_ of office being over for him. What a letter\r\n    full of _John_, and just when I ought to be talking of\r\n    everybody else except _John_; but you will guess that if he\r\n    were not perfectly cheerful--and he is more, he is full of\r\n    patriotic eagerness--I could not write all this.... Thanks for your\r\n    sympathy about Johnny--we were _very_ sorry, I need not\r\n    say[71].... I don't at all mind the beating, which has been a\r\n    glorious one in every way, but I _immensely_ mind his not\r\n    being in Parliament....\r\n\r\n    Your most affectionate sister, F.R.\r\n\r\n[71] Lord Amberley was defeated in the General Election.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Charles Dickens to Lady Russell\r\n\r\n    GAD'S HILL PLACE, HIGHAM BY ROCHESTER, KENT\r\n\r\n    Saturday, December 26, 1868\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR LADY RUSSELL,--... I cannot tell you how highly I esteem\r\n    your kind Christmas remembrances, or how earnestly I send all\r\n    seasonable wishes to you and Lord Russell and all who are dearest\r\n    to you. I am unselfishly glad that Lord Russell is out of the\r\n    turmoil and worry of a new Administration, but I miss him from it\r\n    sorely. I was saying only yesterday to Layard (who is staying\r\n    here), that I could not get over the absence of that great Liberal\r\n    name from a Liberal Government, and that I lost heart without it.\r\n\r\n    Ever faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n    CHARLES DICKENS\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Victoria Villiers_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _February_ 4, 1869\r\n\r\n    We have had such a gay time of it--that is, from Saturday to Monday\r\n    only; but we have had such a quiet life in general that that seems\r\n    a great deal. The Gladstones with daughter Mary to dine. Gladstone\r\n    was unanimously pronounced to be most agreeable and delightful. I\r\n    never saw him in such high spirits, and he was as ready to talk\r\n    about anything and everything, small and great, as if he had no\r\n    Ministerial weight on his shoulders. He carries such fire and\r\n    eloquence into whatever he talks about that it seems for the moment\r\n    the most important subject in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Mr. Rollo Russell_\r\n\r\n    37 CHESHAM PLACE, _March_ 2, 1869\r\n\r\n    London is extremely agreeable now, not rackety, but sociable--at\r\n    least to the like of us who do not attempt to mix in the very gay\r\n    world....\r\n\r\n    Arthur Russell called last night after hearing Gladstone's great\r\n    speech [on Irish Disestablishment], well pleased himself and\r\n    expecting the country to be so--_the_ country, Ireland, more\r\n    especially. _On_ the whole your father is satisfied, but not\r\n    _with_ the whole; he does not approve of the churches being\r\n    left to the Protestants for ever, as there is nothing granted to\r\n    the Roman Catholics. Neither does he like the appropriation of\r\n    national money to charities. [72]\r\n\r\n[72] The Bill transferred to the new disestablished Episcopal Church all\r\nthe churches, all endowments given since 1660, while the remaining funds\r\nwere to be handed over to the Government for the relief of poverty and\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nLord Russell had followed up his first letter to Mr. Chichester Fortescue\r\nby two more letters, in which he again advocated both the disestablishment\r\nand disendowment of the Irish Church. He warmly supported Gladstone's\r\nmeasure; though he again insisted that the funds of the Irish Church should\r\nbe used to endow the other Churches. He was in constant attendance at the\r\nHouse of Lords, and during the same session he proposed, without success, a\r\nmeasure which would have added a limited number of life peers to the Second\r\nChamber. These incursions into politics seem in no way to have taxed his\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Mr. William Russell_\r\n\r\n    _June_ 3, 1869\r\n\r\n    It is a great misfortune that we have so few really eminent men\r\n    among the clergy of England, Scotland, or Ireland--in any of the\r\n    various communities. Such men are greatly needed to take the lead\r\n    in what I cannot but look upon as a noble march of the progress of\r\n    mankind, the assertion of the right to think and speak with\r\n    unbounded freedom on that which concerns us all more deeply than\r\n    anything else--religion. I believe that by the exercise of such\r\n    unbounded freedom we shall reach to a knowledge of God and a\r\n    comprehension of the all-perfect spirit of Christianity such as no\r\n    Established Church has ever taught by Creeds or Articles, though\r\n    individuals of all such Churches have forgotten Creeds and\r\n    Articles, and taught \"true religion and undefiled\" out of the real\r\n    Word of God and their own high and holy thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _August_ 18, 1869\r\n\r\n    My dear husband seventy-seven this day. God be thanked for all that\r\n    has made it a calm and bright and blessed one to us.\r\n\r\n    Our happiness now is chiefly in the past and present as to this\r\n    world, in memory more than hope. But the best joys of the past and\r\n    present are linked to that future beyond the grave to which we are\r\n    hastening.... Bright and beautiful day. We sat long together in\r\n    bowling-green and talked of the stir in men's minds on\r\n    Christianity, on all religions and religion, our own thoughts, our\r\n    hope, our trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord Russell to Lady Georgiana Peel_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, RICHMOND PARK, _August_ 18, 1869\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST GEORGY,--... Your very kind and warm congratulations\r\n    delight me. It is sad that the years pass and make one older and\r\n    weaker and sillier, but as they will pass all the same, it is well\r\n    to have one bright day in each year when one's children can recall\r\n    all the past, and feel once again gratitude to the Giver of all\r\n    good.\r\n\r\n    Your affectionate Father, RUSSELL\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Mr. Archibald Peel_\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR ARCHIE,--Thanks for your good wishes. Happy returns I\r\n    always find them, as my children are so affectionate and\r\n    loving--many I cannot expect--but I have played my part, and think\r\n    the rest will be far easier than my task has been.\r\n\r\n    Your affectionate F.I.L. (Father-in-Law)\r\n\r\n    RUSSELL\r\n\r\nOn October 26th they left home for Italy, travelling across France in deep\r\nsnow. They reached the Villa Garbarino, at San Remo, on November 3rd, and\r\nremained there till April, 1870. \"The five months,\" Lady Russell writes,\r\n\"were among the very happiest of our lives, and we reckon it among the\r\nthree earthly paradises to which our wanderings have taken us--La Roche,\r\nSt. Fillans, and San Remo. It was a very quiet life, but with a pleasant\r\namount of society, many people we much liked passing through, or staying\r\nawhile, or, like ourselves, all the winter.\"\r\n\r\nThey also became friendly with several of the Italians of San Remo, whom\r\nthey welcomed at little evening gatherings at their villa. Their landlord,\r\nthe Marchese Garbarino, was an ardent patriot. He it was who had decorated\r\nthe ceiling of his drawing-room with the four portraits: Cavour, Garibaldi,\r\nMazzini, and Lord John Russell, so it was to him a delightful surprise to\r\nhave Lord John as his tenant.\r\n\r\n    _Lord Russell to Lady Minto_\r\n\r\n    SAN REMO, _November_ 23, 1869\r\n\r\n    I am very sorry that headache and neuralgia should have been added\r\n    to illness and dislike of writing, as your reason for not inquiring\r\n    how we were going on. We sit here in the receipt of news without\r\n    any means of reciprocity, but we can speculate on France, Italy,\r\n    and Ireland. Of those, the country which most interests and most\r\n    concerns me, is Ireland.... I have heard much of Lady and Lord\r\n    Byron, and from good sources. I can only conclude that he was half\r\n    mad and loved to frighten her, and that she believed in the stories\r\n    she circulated. [73] The Duke of Wellington said of George IV's\r\n    story that he was at the Battle of Waterloo, \"At first it was a\r\n    lie, than a strong delusion, and at last downright madness.\"\r\n\r\n    Brougham's conversation with William IV on the dissolution was\r\n    another delusion, and so on in perverse, wicked, contradictory\r\n    human nature. Those who like to probe such systems may do so--the\r\n    only wise conclusion is Swift's, \"If you want to confute a lie,\r\n    tell another in the opposite direction.\" Madame de Sévigné tells of\r\n    a curate who put up a clock on his church. His parishioners\r\n    collected stones to break it, saying it was the Gabelle. \"No, my\r\n    friends,\" he said, \"it was the Jubilee,\" on which they all hurrahed\r\n    and went away. If he had said it was a machine to mark the hour,\r\n    his clock would have been broken and himself pelted.\r\n\r\n    I hope your second volume is coming out soon. [74] There are no\r\n    lies in it, and therefore you must not expect a great sale. I must\r\n    stop or you will think me grown a misanthrope. Fanny and Agatha are\r\n    well. If the day had been fine the Crown Princess and her sister\r\n    would have come here to tea, and you would have had no letter from\r\n    me. Do send me a return, when your mankind is gone a-hunting.\r\n\r\n[73] The publication of \"Astarte,\" by the late Lord Lovelace,\r\ncontaining the documents and letters relating to Byron's separation\r\nfrom his wife, has now made it quite clear that the grounds for\r\nseparation were real.\r\n\r\n[74] The second volume of \"Life and Letters of Sir Gilbert Elliot,\r\nFirst Earl of Minto.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_\r\n\r\n    SAN REMO, _December_ 1, 1869\r\n\r\n    Your letter of November 24th found the Amberleys here.... They were\r\n    preceded by the Crown Princess of Prussia and Princess Louis of\r\n    Hesse, announced by telegram in the morning, and a young Prince\r\n    Albert of Prussia, son of the Prince Albert of our Berlin days, and\r\n    a suite of two gentlemen and a lady, who came from Cannes, where\r\n    they are living, on Friday, to pay us a visit, dined with us, slept\r\n    at the nearest hotel, and were off again Saturday morning, we going\r\n    With them as far as Bordighera; and on Monday arrived the Odos [75]\r\n    for one night only, sleeping at an hotel. You see that our usual\r\n    quiet life was for a while exchanged for one of--... Well, I beg\r\n    pardon for this interruption and go back to our illustrious and\r\n    non-illustrious visitors. The illustrious were as merry as if they\r\n    had no royalty about them, and as simple, too, dining in their\r\n    travelling garments, brushing and washing in my room and John's,\r\n    enjoying their dinner, of which happily there was enough (although\r\n    the suite was unexpected owing to my not having received a letter\r\n    giving details), chatting and laughing afterwards till half-past\r\n    eight, when they walked in darkness, and strange to say, mud! but\r\n    with glorious stars overhead, the five minute' distance to their\r\n    hotel, accompanied by Agatha and me. The drive to Bordighera next\r\n    morning was the pleasantest part of the visit to us all--John,\r\n    Princess Louis, and Prince Albert in their carriage, Crown\r\n    Princess, Agatha, and I in ours. It is wonderful to hear Princesses\r\n    express such widely liberal opinions and feelings on education,\r\n    religion, nationality, and if we had talked politics I dare-say I\r\n    should add that too. Their strong love for their Vaterland in spite\r\n    of their early transplantation is also very agreeable.\r\n\r\n    The Amberleys had been ten days with Mill at Avignon--a good\r\n    fortification, I should imagine, against the wiles and\r\n    blandishments of priests of all degree to which they will be\r\n    exposed at Rome.... Little Rachel [76]is as sweet a little\r\n    bright-eyed lassie as I ever saw, hardly saying anything yet, but\r\n    expressing a vast deal.\r\n\r\n[75] Mr. Odo Russell (afterwards Lord Ampthill) and his wife.\r\n\r\n[76] Daughter of Lord and Lady Amberley, born in February, 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord Russell to Colonel Romilly_\r\n\r\n    SAN REMO, _December_ 4, 1869\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR FREDERICK,--I had understood from you that you wished to\r\n    propose some alterations in my Introduction to the Speeches, and I\r\n    was much obliged to you for so kind a thought. But it appears by a\r\n    letter from Lizzy that she and you think that all discussions of\r\n    the future (which are announced in my preface) ought to be omitted.\r\n    In logical and literary aspects you are quite right; but I must\r\n    tell you that since 1832 Ireland has been a main object of all my\r\n    political career.... I am not without hope that the House of\r\n    Commons will pass a reasonable Land Bill, and adhere to the plan of\r\n    national education, which has been in force now for nearly forty\r\n    years. At all events, the present government of Ireland gives no\r\n    proofs of the infallibility of our rulers. Tell Lizzy that it is\r\n    not a plate of salted cherries, but cherries ripe, without any\r\n    salt, which I propose to lay before the Irish.\r\n\r\n    Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n    RUSSELL\r\n\r\nIn the closing passage of the \"Introduction\" referred to in the above\r\nletter Lord Russell gives a modest estimate of his own career: \"My capacity\r\nI always felt was very inferior to that of the men who have attained in\r\npast times the foremost place in our Parliament, and in the Councils of our\r\nSovereign. I have committed many errors, some of them very gross blunders.\r\nBut the generous people of England are always forbearing and forgiving to\r\nthose statesmen who have the good of their country at heart; like my\r\nbetters, I have been misrepresented and slandered by those who knew nothing\r\nof me, but I have been more than compensated by the confidence and the\r\nfriendship of the best men of my own political connection, and by the\r\nregard and favourable interpretation of my motives which I have heard\r\nexpressed by my generous opponents, from the days of Lord Castlereagh to\r\nthose of Mr. Disraeli.\"\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Mr. Rollo Russell_\r\n\r\n    SAN REMO, _February_ 17, 1870\r\n\r\n    How awful Paris will be after the easy, natural, unconventional\r\n    life of San Remo, one delight of which is the absence of all\r\n    thought about dress! Whatever may be and are the delights of\r\n    Paris--and I fully intend that we should all three enjoy\r\n    them--_that_ burden is heavier there than in all the world\r\n    beside--and why? oh, why? What is there to prevent human nature\r\n    from finding out and rejoicing in the blessings of civilization and\r\n    society without encumbering them with petty etiquettes and fashions\r\n    and forms which deprive them of half their value? Human nature is a\r\n    very provoking compound. It strives and struggles and gives life\r\n    itself for political freedom, while it forges social chains and\r\n    fetters for itself and wears them with a foolish smile. And with\r\n    this fruitless lamentation I must end.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_\r\n\r\n    SAN REMO, _February_ 23, 1870\r\n\r\n    I don't know a bit whether we shall be much in London during the\r\n    session--it will be session, not season, that takes us there....\r\n    The longer I live the more I condemn and deplore a rackety life for\r\n    _any_ girl, and therefore if I do what I myself think right by\r\n    her and not what others may think right, she shall never be a\r\n    London butterfly. Would that we could give our girls the ideal\r\n    society which I suppose we all dream for them--that of the wise and\r\n    the good of all ages, of the young and merry of their own. No\r\n    barbarous crowds, no despotic fashions, no senseless omnipotence of\r\n    custom (see \"Childe Harold,\" somewhere).[77] I wonder in this age\r\n    of revolution, which has dethroned so many monarchs and upset so\r\n    many time-honoured systems of Government and broken so many chains,\r\n    that Queen Fashion is left unmolested on her throne, ruling the\r\n    civilized world with her rod of iron, and binding us hand and foot\r\n    in her fetters.\r\n\r\n[77] A favourite stanza of Lady Russell's in \"Childe Harold\":--\r\n\r\n    What from this barren being do we reap?\r\n    Our senses narrow, and our reason frail,\r\n    Life short, and truth a gem which loves the deep,\r\n    And all things weighed in custom's falsest scale;\r\n    Opinion an omnipotence, whose veil\r\n    Mantles the earth with darkness, until right\r\n    And wrong are accidents, and men grow pale\r\n    Lest their own judgments should become too bright,\r\n  And their free thoughts be crimes, and earth have too much light.\r\n\r\n    BYRON.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_\r\n\r\n    SAN REMO, _March_ 2, 1870\r\n\r\n    I am writing in my pretty bedroom, at an east window which is wide\r\n    open, letting in the balmiest of airs, and the spring twittering of\r\n    chaffinches and larks and other little birds, and the gentle music\r\n    of the waves. Below the window I look at a very untidy bit of\r\n    nondescript ground, with a few white-armed fig-trees and a number\r\n    of flaunting Italian daisies--a little farther an enclosure of\r\n    glossy green orange-trees laden with fruit; then an olive\r\n    plantation, soft and feathery; then a bare, brownish, pleasant\r\n    hill, crowned by the \"Madonna della Guardia,\" and stretching to the\r\n    sea, which I should like to call blue, but which is a dull grey. Oh\r\n    dear, how sorry we shall be to leave it all! You, I know,\r\n    understand the sort of shrinking there is after so quiet, so\r\n    spoiling, so natural and unconventional a life (not to mention\r\n    climate and beauty) from the thought of the overpowering quantity\r\n    of people and business of all sorts and the artificial habits of\r\n    our own country, in spite of the immense pleasure of looking\r\n    forward to brothers and sisters and children and friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Mr. Rollo Russell_\r\n\r\n    SAN REMO, _March_ 17, 1870\r\n\r\n    ... No doubt we must always in the last resort trust to our own\r\n    reason upon all subjects on which our reason is capable of helping\r\n    us. On a question of _language_, Hebrew for instance, if we\r\n    don't know it and somebody else does, we cannot of course dispute\r\n    his translation, but where nobody questions the words, everybody\r\n    has a right--it is indeed everybody's duty--to reflect upon their\r\n    meaning and bearing and come to their own conclusions; listening to\r\n    others wiser or not wiser than themselves, eagerly seeking help,\r\n    but never, oh never fettering their minds by an unconditional and\r\n    premeditated submission to _anybody_ else's, or rather\r\n    _pretending_ so to fetter it, for a mind will make itself\r\n    heard, and there's much false modesty in the disclaimer of all\r\n    power or right to judge--that very disclaimer being in fact, as you\r\n    say, an exercise of private judgment and a rebellion or protest\r\n    against thousands of wise and good and learned men.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_\r\n\r\n    SAN REMO, _March_ 23, 1870\r\n\r\n    You must take John's second letter to Forster, [78] which will\r\n    appear in the _Times_ and _Daily News_, as my letter to\r\n    you for to-day, as I had already not left myself much time for you,\r\n    so that copying them, although they are not long, has left me\r\n    hardly any. I think you will agree with him that now, when the\r\n    moment seems come for a really national system of education, it\r\n    would be a great pity not to put an end to the teaching of\r\n    catechisms in rate-supported schools. People may of course always\r\n    have their little pet, privately supported sectarian schools, but\r\n    surely, surely, it's enough that the weary catechism should be\r\n    repeated and yawned over every Sunday of the year, where there are\r\n    Sunday schools. I wonder whether you are in favour of compulsory\r\n    attendance. I don't like it, but I do like compulsory rating, and I\r\n    wish the Bill made it general and not local, and I also want the\r\n    education to be gratis.\r\n\r\n[78] In February Mr. Forster introduced the Elementary Education\r\nAct. It passed the second reading without a division. In Committee\r\nthe Cowper-Temple Clause was admitted by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_\r\n\r\n    SAN REMO, _April_ 6, 1870\r\n\r\n    We go on discussing the Education Bill and all that is written\r\n    about it with immense interest, but oh, the clergy! they seem\r\n    resolved to fulfil the prophecy that Christ came not to bring peace\r\n    on earth, but a sword.... How true what you say of want of\r\n    earnestness in London society and Parliament!\r\n\r\nOn April 7th they left San Remo, \"servants [79] all in tears,\" she writes,\r\n\"and all, high and low, showering blessings on us, and praying for our\r\nwelfare in their lovely language.\" At Paris they stayed with Lord Lyons at\r\nthe British Embassy. The Emperor Napoleon and Empress Eugénie showed them\r\nmuch kindness during their visit to Paris. One evening Lord and Lady\r\nRussell and their daughter dined at the Tuileries, Lady Russell sitting\r\nnext the Emperor and Lord Russell next the Empress. It has been told since\r\nthat at this dinner the Emperor mentioned a riddle which he had put to the\r\nEmpress, and her reply.\r\n\r\n  _Emperor._ Quelle est la différence entre toi et un miroir?\r\n  _Empress._ Je ne sais pas.\r\n  _Emperor._ Le miroir réfléchit; tu ne réfléchis pas.\r\n  _Empress._ Et quelle est la différence entre toi et un miroir?\r\n  _Emperor._ Je ne sais pas.\r\n  _Empress._ Le miroir est poli, et tu ne l'es pas.\r\n\r\n[79] Their Italian servants.\r\n\r\nOn April 27th, after six months' absence, Lord and Lady Russell were once\r\nmore at Pembroke Lodge.\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Mr. Rollo Russell_\r\n\r\n    37 CHESHAM PLACE, _May_ 26, 1870\r\n\r\n    ... We came up, your father and I, on Tuesday to dine with\r\n    Clarendons, and stayed all yesterday to dine with Salisburys. Many\r\n    things strike me on returning to England and English society: the\r\n    superiority of its best to those of any other nation; the larger\r\n    proportion of vulgarity in all classes; ostentatious vulgarity,\r\n    aristocratic vulgarity, coarse vulgarity; the stir and activity of\r\n    mind on religion, politics, morals, all that is most worthy of\r\n    thought. What is to come of it all? Will goodness and truth\r\n    prevail? Is a great regeneration coming? I believe it in spite of\r\n    many discouraging symptoms. I believe that a coming generation will\r\n    try to be and not only call itself Christian. God grant that each\r\n    of my children may add some little ray of light by thought, word,\r\n    and deed to help in dispelling the darkness of error, sin, and\r\n    crime in this and all other lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Mr. Rollo Russell_\r\n\r\n    _June_ 2, 1870\r\n\r\n    I wish most earnestly for legal and social equality for women, but\r\n    I cannot shut my eyes to what woman has already been--the equal, if\r\n    not the superior, of man in all that is highest and noblest and\r\n    loveliest. I don't at all approve of any appearance of setting one\r\n    against the other. Let equal justice be done to both, without any\r\n    spirit of antagonism.... I can well believe in all the delights of\r\n    Oxford, and envy men that portion of their life.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n1870-78\r\n\r\n\r\nIn July, 1870, public attention was abruptly distracted from Irish and\r\neducational questions by the outbreak of the Franco-German War, which\r\nfollowed immediately upon the King of Prussia's refusal to promise France\r\nthat he would never, under any circumstances, countenance his cousin Prince\r\nLeopold's candidature for the Spanish throne. War came as a surprise to\r\nevery one, even to the Foreign Office, and its real causes were little\r\nunderstood at the time. The entire blame fell on Napoleon. Only some, who\r\nhad special information, knew that Bismarck had long been waiting for the\r\nopportunity which the extravagant demand of France had just given him; and\r\nvery few among the well-informed guessed that he might have had a hand in\r\ncontriving the cause of dispute itself. Napoleon, since his annexation of\r\nSavoy, had so bad a reputation in Europe, a reputation which Bismarck had\r\nmanaged to blacken still more in their recent controversy over Luxembourg,\r\nthat people were ready to take it as a matter of course that Napoleon\r\nshould be the aggressor. Finally, by publishing through the _Times_\r\nthe secret document in M. Benedetti's own hand, which assured help to\r\nGermany in annexing Holland, if Germany would help Napoleon to seize\r\nBelgium, Bismarck destroyed all remaining sympathy for France.\r\n\r\nNow, however, that the inner history of events has come to light, we know\r\nthat it was Germany who fomented the quarrel, though both Austria and\r\nFrance must be held responsible for the conditions which made the policy of\r\nGermany possible. The significant suppression of the part of Bernhardi's\r\nmemoirs dealing with his secret mission from Bismarck to Spain, and the\r\nfact that a large sum of Prussian money is now known to have passed to\r\nSpain, [80] while the Cortes was discussing the question of succession,\r\nmake it probable that Bismarck not only took advantage of French hostility\r\nto Prince Leopold's candidature, but deliberately instigated the offer of\r\nthe Spanish throne to a German prince, because he knew France was certain\r\nto resent it.\r\n\r\n[80] Lord Acton, \"Historical Essays and Studies.\"\r\n\r\nNapoleon, however, must be held responsible, inasmuch as since the close of\r\nthe Seven Weeks' War, he had intrigued with Austria to induce her to\r\nrevenge herself by a joint attack with him upon Germany, hoping that he\r\nmight win with Austria's help those concessions of territory along the\r\nRhine, which Bismarck had peremptorily refused him as a _pour-boire_\r\nafter Sadowa. Austria, too, must take a share of the responsibility, since\r\nthrough the secret negotiations of the Archduke Albrecht she had encouraged\r\nNapoleon in this idea. Both Napoleon and the Archduke were convinced that\r\nthose South-German States which had been annexed by Prussia for siding with\r\nAustria would rise, if their attack on Prussia could be associated with the\r\nidea of liberation. Bismarck's cleverness in picking the quarrel over the\r\nquestion of the Spanish succession, a matter which did not in the least\r\nconcern South-Germany, proved fatal to their expectations. This triumph of\r\ndiplomacy, together with the success of his master-stroke of provocation,\r\nthe Ems telegram, decided the fate of France. As edited by Bismarck, the\r\nKing of Prussia's telegram describing his last interview with the French\r\nAmbassador at Ems, infuriated the French to the necessary pitch of\r\nrecklessness, while to Germans it read like the account of an insult to\r\nGerman-speaking peoples, and tended to draw them together in resentment.\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_\r\n\r\n    SALTBURN, _August_ 24, 1870\r\n\r\n    Don't you sometimes feel that a few weeks' delay in beginning this\r\n    horrible war might have given time to Europe to discover some\r\n    better means than war for settling the dispute? We are full of\r\n    schemes for the prevention of future wars. The only compensation I\r\n    see for all these horrors is the conviction they bring of the\r\n    amount of heroism in the world and of the progress made in humanity\r\n    towards enemies--especially sick and wounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_\r\n\r\n    SALTBURN, _August_ 30, 1870\r\n\r\n    Poor Paris! You may well say we must be sorry for it, having so\r\n    lately seen it in all its gay spring beauty--and though no doubt\r\n    the surface, which is all we saw of its inhabitants, is better than\r\n    the groundwork, how much of good and great it contains! How the\r\n    best Frenchmen everywhere, and the best Parisians in particular,\r\n    must grieve over the deep corruption which has done much to bring\r\n    their country to its present dreary prospects. I did not mean that\r\n    any mediation or interference of other Powers would have prevented\r\n    this war, but that there ought by this time to be a substitute\r\n    found for all war.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_\r\n\r\n    SALTBURN, _September_ 7, 1870\r\n\r\n    Don't you find it bewildering to be hurried at express speed\r\n    through such mighty pages of history? And if bewildering and\r\n    overpowering to us, who from the beginning of the war could see a\r\n    probability of French disaster, what must it be to Paris, to all\r\n    France, fed with falsehood as they have been till from one success\r\n    to another they find their Emperor and an army of 80,000 men\r\n    prisoners of war! But what a people! Who would have supposed by\r\n    reading the accounts of Paris on Sunday, the excess of joy, the\r\n    _air de fête_, the wild exultation, that an immense calamity,\r\n    a bitter mortification had just befallen the country! that a\r\n    gigantic German army was on its way to their gates! I should like\r\n    to know whether many of those who shouted \"Vive l'Empereur\" when he\r\n    left Paris, who applauded the war and hooted down anybody who\r\n    doubted its justice or attacked Imperialism, are now among the\r\n    shouters of \"Vive la Republique\" and the new Democratic Ministry.\r\n    Let us hope not. Let us hope a great many things from the downfall\r\n    of a corrupt Court, and the call for heroism and self-sacrifice to\r\n    a frivolous and depraved city--frivolous and depraved, and yet\r\n    containing so much of noble and good--all the nobler and better,\r\n    perhaps, from the constant struggle to remain so in that\r\n    atmosphere. Even if, as God grant, there is no siege, the serious\r\n    thoughts which the prospect of it must give will perhaps not be\r\n    lost on the Parisians. I, like you, long that the King of Prussia\r\n    may prove that he spoke in all sincerity when he said that he\r\n    fought against the Emperor, not France, and be magnanimous in the\r\n    conditions he may offer--but what does that precisely mean? John\r\n    says he is right to seek for some guarantee against future French\r\n    ambition. Hitherto he has acted very like a gentleman, as John in\r\n    the House of Lords declared him to be, and may still be your model\r\n    sovereign.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Mr. Rollo Russell_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _November_ 3, 1870\r\n\r\n    Your letter is so interesting and raises so many serious thoughts\r\n    that I should like to answer it as it deserves, but can't do so\r\n    to-day as I am obliged to go to London on business, and have hardly\r\n    a moment. The kind of \"gigantic brains\" which you mention are, I\r\n    agree with you, often repulsive--there is a harshness of\r\n    _dissent_ from all that mankind most values, all that has\r\n    raised them above this earth, which cannot be right--which is the\r\n    result of deficiency in some part of their minds or hearts or both,\r\n    and not of excess of intellect or any other good thing. If they are\r\n    right in their contempt of Christian faith and hope, or of all\r\n    other spiritual faith and hope, they ought to be \"of all men most\r\n    miserable\"; but they are apt to reject Christian charity too, and\r\n    to dance on the ruins of all that has hitherto sustained their\r\n    fellow-creatures in a world of sin and sorrow. That they are not\r\n    right, but wofully wrong, I firmly believe, and happily many and\r\n    many a noble intellect and great heart, which have not shrunk from\r\n    searching into the mysteries of life and death with all the powers\r\n    and all the love of truth given them by God to be used, not to lie\r\n    dormant or merely receive what other men teach, have risen from the\r\n    search with a firmer faith than before in Christ and in the\r\n    immortality which he brought to light. I believe that many of those\r\n    who deem themselves sceptics or atheists retain, after all, enough\r\n    of the divine element within them practically to refute their own\r\n    words.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _January_ 4, 1871\r\n\r\n    I wonder whether the solemn thoughts which must belong to the end\r\n    of a year, and the solemn services by which it has been celebrated\r\n    both by Germans and French, will lead them to ask themselves in all\r\n    earnestness whether it is really duty, really what they believe to\r\n    be God's will, which guides them in the continuance of a fearful\r\n    war--whether earthly passions, earthly point of honour, do not\r\n    mingle with their determination. If they do ask themselves such\r\n    questions, what will be the answers? I, too, am often tempted to\r\n    wish peace at any price, yet neither you nor I would act upon the\r\n    wish were we the people to act. It was the peace at any price\r\n    doctrine that forced us into the Russian war.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _January_ 25, 1871\r\n\r\n    Hopes of peace at last, thank God! I can think of little else--the\r\n    increasing and accumulating horrors, miseries, and desolation of\r\n    this wicked war have been enough to make one despair of mankind.\r\n    France alone was in the wrong at first, but both have been wrong\r\n    ever since Sedan, so at least I think, but it is too long a matter\r\n    to discuss in a letter. If the new Emperor [81] does not grant most\r\n    honourable terms to Paris, I shall give him up altogether as a\r\n    self-seeking, hard-hearted old man of fire and sword. I dare say\r\n    you have not heard as many sad stories as we have of the losses and\r\n    disasters and unspeakable sorrows of people in Paris, known to\r\n    other people we have seen. I won't repeat any of them, as it can do\r\n    no good. I am glad to know that the Crown Prince _hates_ the\r\n    war, _hates_ the bombardment, and opposed it strongly, and\r\n    then again opposed sending shells into the town, and was very angry\r\n    when it began to be done. Indeed, everything that we hear of him is\r\n    highly to his credit, and one may hope much for the welfare and\r\n    good government of United Germany from him and his wife.\r\n\r\n[81] King William of Prussia had just taken the title of German\r\nEmperor.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Mr. Rollo Russell_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _January_ 26, 1871\r\n\r\n    ... We are rejoicing and thanking God for the blessed news of the\r\n    coming surrender of Paris. Alas for all the wasted lives--wasted,\r\n    _I_ think, on both sides, for I cannot perceive that it was on\r\n    either side one of those great and holy causes in which the blood\r\n    shed by one generation bears fruit for the next. The _Times_\r\n    was too quick in drawing conclusions from Jules Favre being at\r\n    Versailles, but there can be little doubt that terms are under\r\n    consideration, and I hope the Germans will show that they are not\r\n    so spoiled by success as to be ungenerous in their demands. As to\r\n    Alsace and Lorraine, I fear that it is a settled point with them.\r\n    If so, they ought to be all the more ready to grant terms\r\n    honourable in other respects. Do you see that a brave man in the\r\n    Berlin Parliament raised his voice against annexation of French\r\n    provinces, on the discussion of address to the new Emperor on his\r\n    new dignity? ... What wonderfully interesting lectures Tyndall is\r\n    giving.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _July_ 12, 1871\r\n\r\n    We lunched yesterday, all three, with Bernstorffs, [82] to meet\r\n    Crown Prince and Princess--best of Princes and Princesses. It was\r\n    interesting and agreeable. John and I had the luck to sit beside\r\n    her and him. I was delighted to hear him say, \"I hate war,\" with an\r\n    emphasis better than words.\r\n\r\n[82] Count Bernstorff was German Ambassador in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _July_ 27, 1871\r\n\r\n    ... I suppose Agatha told you of the Emperor of Brazil's visit to\r\n    us at 7 a.m.--it was amusing to get up at six to receive an\r\n    Emperor, impossible to put on much ceremony with one's garments at\r\n    that unceremonious hour, and fortunately unnecessary, for His\r\n    Majesty was chatty and easy. He took a turn along West walk,\r\n    admired the view, had a cup of chocolate, thanked us for our\r\n    courtesy, and was off again before eight with his sallow-faced,\r\n    grimy gentleman in waiting, who looked as if the little sleep he\r\n    ever had was with his clothes on. We tried to see another Emperor\r\n    [83] on Tuesday, having at last made out our journey to\r\n    Chislehurst. Unluckily he and his son had gone to town, but we\r\n    found the Empress. How unlike the splendid, bejewelled,\r\n    pomp-and-gloryfied Empress of the Tuileries: her dress careless and\r\n    common, her face little, if at all, painted, and thereby to my eye\r\n    improved--but so altered. She seemed, however, in good spirits. She\r\n    did not talk of France, but feared for England anything tending to\r\n    diminish authority of \"powers that be.\"\r\n\r\n[83] Napoleon III and the Empress Eugénie were living at Chislehurst.\r\n\r\nOn August 18, 1871, Lord Russell's seventy-ninth birthday was celebrated at\r\nPembroke Lodge by the school children under the cedar in the garden. \"His\r\nserene and cheerful mind, a greater blessing year by year as enjoyments one\r\nby one drop away. He looks back with gratitude, he accepts the present with\r\ncontentment. He looks forward, I think, without dread.\" In September they\r\nwent abroad, and took for the second time the house at Renens-sur-Roche, in\r\nSwitzerland, where they had stayed in 1855. Lady Russell's mind was still\r\nfull of horror of the recent war.\r\n\r\nThe first morning at Glyon (she writes to her sister, Lady Dunfermline) was\r\none of merciless rain, but the afternoon did well enough for Chillon, to\r\nwhich use we all put it, and very interesting, grimly and horribly so, we\r\nfound it. Men are less wicked and less cruel, tyrants are less tyrannical\r\nnowadays than when so-called criminals, often the best men in their\r\ncountry, were chained by iron rings to dungeon stones for years and years,\r\nor fastened to pillars and tortured by slow fires, or thrown down\r\n\"oubliettes\" into the lake below, falling first on a revolving machine\r\nstuck full of sharp blades--of all which horrors we were shown the scene\r\nand the remains. But I hope that some centuries hence travellers will\r\nwonder at even the present use to which Chillon is put, that of an arsenal,\r\nand thank God that they did not live in an age when sovereigns and rulers\r\ncould command man to destroy his brother-man.\r\n\r\nFrom Switzerland they moved down to the South of France to get to a warmer\r\nclimate. They had taken a villa for the winter at Cannes, where they had a\r\nhappy time, brightened during the Christmas vacation by the visits of their\r\nsons with friends from Oxford. In his old age Lord Russell seemed to enjoy\r\nmore and more the companionship of the young, and entered with spirit into\r\ntheir merry jests and their eager conversations on great subjects,\r\ndiscussed with the freshness and enthusiasm of youth.\r\n\r\nLord Russell, as the following letters show, was still taking keen interest\r\nin education questions:\r\n\r\n    _Lord Russell to Colonel Romilly_\r\n\r\n    RENENS, _September_ 27, 1871\r\n\r\n    I see the Bishop of Manchester has been speaking in favour of \"a\r\n    very moderate form of dogmatism\" to be imposed on Dissenters who\r\n    wish their children to have religious teaching. I am quite against\r\n    this moderate form, which consists in making a Baptist child own\r\n    that he is to believe what his godfathers and godmothers promised\r\n    for him--he having neither godfathers nor godmothers. Every form of\r\n    persecution is in my eyes detestable, so that I shall have to fight\r\n    a new fight for freedom of education.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord Russell to Lady Minto_\r\n\r\n    CANNES, _January_ 6, 1872\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST NINA,--Your New Year's Day letter shows that you write\r\n    as well as a volunteer as on compulsion.... I am sorry to have\r\n    annoyed Maggie by my allusion to the Hertfordshire incumbent. Here\r\n    is my case. Sixty-three years ago my father, with others founded a\r\n    Society to teach the Bible to young boys and girls, which they\r\n    called \"Schools for all.\" One should have thought there was no harm\r\n    in the project, and that they might have been left alone. Not so.\r\n    The clergy were furious. Sixty years ago they founded the National\r\n    Society, and ever since they have libelled our schools.... Last\r\n    year or the year before the H.I. [Hertfordshire Incumbent] attacked\r\n    my proposals. I left him alone, but I carried the day, and excluded\r\n    formularies from schools provided by rates. Still the bishops and\r\n    clergy fulminate against us, shut out Baptists from the schools\r\n    where they have influence, and declaim against us. Now I happen to\r\n    have a great respect for the Bible, and while I have life will not\r\n    cease to defend our Bible schools. You will say, if I do not, that\r\n    in time the world will come round to Christianity, which is at a\r\n    low ebb at present. Men will understand at last that they ought to\r\n    love God and to love their neighbour as themselves, not to steal,\r\n    or commit murder, or cheat their neighbours. The Athanasian Creed\r\n    is making a pretty hubbub. It was invented as a substitute for\r\n    Christianity, and taken from Aristotle....\r\n\r\n    Ever yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n    RUSSELL\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_\r\n\r\n    CANNES, _November_ 29, 1871\r\n\r\n    What is to be the result of the Republican ferment in our country?\r\n    It may not be widespread, and it certainly hardly exists above the\r\n    working classes, yet I feel that the germ is there--and who can say\r\n    how far it is doomed to flourish, or whether it will die away....\r\n    Ours has been so free and independent and prosperous a nation, that\r\n    the notion of any fundamental change in the Constitution is awful.\r\n    Yet when we boast of our freedom and prosperity we should not\r\n    forget the enormous mass of misery, vice, filth, and all evil which\r\n    disgraces all our large towns--nor the brutish ignorance and apathy\r\n    which pervades much of our rural population. And it is well worth\r\n    the most earnest thought and study, on the part of all Englishmen\r\n    and women, to find out whether our form of government has or has\r\n    not any share of the blame and to act accordingly. I have great\r\n    confidence in the British people. They have never liked hasty,\r\n    ill-considered changes; they hate revolution; and I hope I am not\r\n    too trustful in believing that we shall go on in the wise and the\r\n    right path, whatever that may be, and in spite of the freaks and\r\n    follies of many a man whose aims are more selfish than patriotic.\r\n\r\nWhile at Cannes Lord and Lady Russell saw a great deal of Princess\r\nChristian, who was living near them, and was in great anxiety and sorrow\r\nabout the illness of her brother, the Prince of Wales, who nearly died in\r\nDecember, 1871. His illness was the occasion of a display of loyalty and\r\nsympathy from thousands of British subjects. Lady Russell received the\r\nfollowing reply to a letter she wrote from Cannes to the Queen:\r\n\r\n    _Queen Victoria to Lady Russell_\r\n\r\n    OSBORNE, _January_ 22, 1872\r\n\r\n    DEAR LADY RUSSELL,--I meant ere this to have thanked you for your\r\n    very kind letter of the 1st, but my dear son's illness brought with\r\n    it much writing besides much to do, in addition to which, there is\r\n    the correspondence with _four_ absent married daughters, which\r\n    is no light task. I thank you now _both_ most warmly for the\r\n    great kindness of your expressions about my own long and severe\r\n    illness, when you so kindly wrote to Lady Ely to inquire, and\r\n    relative to this last dreadful illness of my dear son's, coming, as\r\n    it did, when I was far from strong myself. Thank God! I was able to\r\n    be near him and with my _beloved_ daughter, the Princess of\r\n    Wales (who behaved so beautifully and admirably), during that\r\n    terrible time, when for nearly a week his life hung on a thread.\r\n    Indeed, for a whole month _at least,_ if not for five weeks,\r\n    his state was one of the greatest anxiety and indeed of danger.\r\n    Since the 4th we may look on his progress as steady and good, and I\r\n    hear that he was able to drive out yesterday for a little while.\r\n    But great quiet will be necessary for a long while to come. You are\r\n    very kind in your accounts of Helena, who no doubt must have\r\n    suffered much from being so far off.... I hear that she is really\r\n    better and stronger. She speaks often of the pleasure it is to her\r\n    to see you and Lord Russell, of whom I am delighted to hear so good\r\n    an account. Though not very strong and not free from rheumatic\r\n    pains at times, I am much better and able to walk again out of\r\n    doors, much as usual.\r\n\r\n    With kind remembrances to Lord Russell and Agatha,\r\n\r\n    Ever yours affectionately, V.R.\r\n\r\nIn the spring they all came back to England. Lord John had benefited in\r\nhealth by wintering abroad; he was still vigorous enough to resist in the\r\nHouse of Lords the claim of the United States for the _Alabama_\r\nindemnity, and to give a presidential address to the Historical Society;\r\nbut the years were beginning to tell on him.\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _April_ 18, 1872\r\n\r\n    John did not venture out--still looks tired and not as he did when\r\n    we arrived, but no cold. Sad, most sad to me, that when I take a\r\n    brisk turn in the garden, it is no longer with him--that his\r\n    enjoyments, his active powers, yearly dwindle away--that it is\r\n    scarcely possible he should not at times feel the hours too long\r\n    from the difficulty of finding variety of occupation. Writing,\r\n    walking, even reading very long or talking much with friends and\r\n    visitors all tire him. He never complains, and I thank God for his\r\n    patience, and oh! so heartily that he has no pain, no chronic\r\n    ailment. But alas for the days of his vigour when he was out and in\r\n    twenty times a day, when life had a zest which nothing can restore!\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _August_ 8, 1872\r\n\r\n    Filled with wonder, shame, remorse, I begin on a Thursday to write\r\n    to you. What possessed me to let Wednesday pass without doing so I\r\n    can't tell, but I think it happens about once a year, and I dare\r\n    say it's a statistical mystery--the averages must be kept right,\r\n    and my mind is not to blame--no free will in the matter. This\r\n    brings me to an essay in one of the magazines for August--I forget\r\n    which--on the statistics of prayer. Not a nice name (perhaps it's\r\n    not correct, but nearly so), and not a nice article, it seemed to\r\n    me--but I only glanced at it; produced, like many other faulty\r\n    things of the kind, by illogical superstition on the part of\r\n    Christian clergy, most of whom preach a half-belief, some a whole\r\n    belief, on the efficacy of prayer for temporal good. Then comes the\r\n    hard unbeliever, delighted to prove, as any child can do, that such\r\n    prayer cannot be proved to avail anything. He is incapable of\r\n    understanding the deeper and truer kind of prayer, but he convinces\r\n    many that all communion with God is fruitless, or perhaps that\r\n    there is no God with whom to hold it. This may not be the drift of\r\n    the article, for, as I said, I have not read it, but it _is_\r\n    the drift of much that is talked and written nowadays by men and\r\n    women of the author's school. I wish there were no schools in that\r\n    sense. They always have done and always will do harm, and prevent\r\n    the independence of thought which they are by way of encouraging.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _Christmas Day,_ 1872\r\n\r\n    I do indeed feel with you how wonderful the goodness and the\r\n    contented spirit of many thousands of poor, pent-up, toiling human\r\n    beings, who live in God's glorious world and leave it without ever\r\n    knowing its glories, whose lives are one struggle to maintain life;\r\n    and I think with you how easy it ought to be for us who have\r\n    leisure for the beauty of life, in nature and in books, in\r\n    conversation and in art. And yet, it was to the rich that Christ\r\n    gave His most frequent warnings. Is it then, after all, easiest for\r\n    the poor to do His will and love Him and trust Him in all things?\r\n\r\nThe summer and autumn and winter had been spent almost entirely at Pembroke\r\nLodge, but when Parliament met early in 1873 they moved to London, where\r\nthey had taken a house till Easter.\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _February_ 19, 1873\r\n\r\n    Scene--a drawing-room; hour 11.30 a.m. A young lady playing the\r\n    pianoforte by candle-light. An old lady writing, also by\r\n    candle-light. An old gentleman five minutes ago sitting reading\r\n    also by candle-light, but now doing the same in a room below. Three\r\n    large windows through which is seen a vast expanse of a\r\n    semi-substantial material of the hue of a smoked primrose; against\r\n    it is dimly visible an irregular and picturesque outline, probably\r\n    of a range of mountains, some rocky and pyramidal, others\r\n    horizontally banked. Altogether, a mystery replete with grandeur in\r\n    the effect--none of your Southern transparency leaving nothing for\r\n    the imagination. _Seriously,_ it's laughable that human beings\r\n    should congregate so as to produce these effects, and that we among\r\n    others should by preference be among the congregators. Your day at\r\n    Napoule is like something in a different world altogether.\r\n\r\n    You are rather hard, John says, and he is not disposed to be\r\n    otherwise, on Parliamentary sayings and doings. I can say nothing\r\n    from myself, as I have not read one single speech, except that I\r\n    cannot bear the humiliating exclusion of _any_ kind of useful\r\n    knowledge from a University out of false consideration for\r\n    religious or irreligious scruples. [84] Surely young men had better\r\n    be taught boldly to face the fact that men differ than be dealt\r\n    with in this ridiculously tender and most futile manner.\r\n\r\n[84] The Irish University Bill was being discussed in the Commons, one\r\nclause of which proposed to exclude theology, philosophy, and history from\r\nthe curriculum of the New University.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1873, after the publication of Lord Russell's book, \"Essays on\r\nthe History of the Christian Religion,\" they spent some six weeks at\r\nDieppe, where Lord Russell's health again considerably improved.\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Disraeli to Lord Russell_\r\n\r\n    GEORGE STREET, HANOVER SQUARE, _May_ 8, 1873\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR LORD,--I have just finished reading your book, which I was\r\n    much gratified by receiving from the author.... I cannot refrain\r\n    from expressing to you the great pleasure its perusal gave me. The\r\n    subject is of perpetual interest, and it is treated, in many\r\n    instances, with originality founded on truth, and with wonderful\r\n    freshness. The remarks suggested by your own eminent career give to\r\n    the general conduct of the theme additional interest, like the\r\n    personal passages in Montaigne. I wish there had been more of them,\r\n    or that you would favour the world with some observations on men\r\n    and things, which one who is alike a statesman, a philosopher, and\r\n    a scholar could alone supply. In your retirement you have the\r\n    inestimable happiness of constant and accomplished sympathy,\r\n    without which life is little worth. Mine is lone and dark, but\r\n    still, I hope I may send my kindest remembrances to Lady Russell.\r\n\r\n    Yours with sincere respect and regard,\r\n\r\n    B. DISRAELI\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _July_ 3, 1873\r\n\r\n    You will not be disappointed, I do believe, with John's book, high\r\n    as your expectations are. The spirit of it at all events is that of\r\n    your letter: that of love and reverence for what you truly call the\r\n    wonder of wonders--the Bible--as well as that of perfect freedom of\r\n    thought. Had that perfect freedom always been allowed to mankind by\r\n    kings, rulers, and priests, in all their disguises, we should never\r\n    have had the \"trash\" of which you complain inundating our country\r\n    and thinking itself a substitute for the simple lessons and\r\n    glorious promises of Christ. Whereas in proportion as it is less\r\n    \"trashy,\" it approaches more nearly, though unconsciously, to what\r\n    He taught, borrowing what is best in it from Him, only giving an\r\n    earthly tone to what He made divine. I have, perhaps, more\r\n    indulgence than you for some of the anti-Christian thinkers and\r\n    writers of the day--those who love truth with all their souls, who\r\n    would give their lives to believe that--\r\n\r\n      \"Dust thou art, to dust returnest,\r\n       Was not spoken of the soul,\"\r\n\r\n    but who seek a kind of proof of this which never can be found. They\r\n    are very unhappy in this world, but I believe they are nearer\r\n    heaven than many comfortable so-called believers, and will find\r\n    their happiness beyond that death upon which they look as\r\n    annihilation.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _October_ 22, 1873\r\n\r\n    Louisa [85] writes in such warm admiration of Minto indoors and\r\n    out, it did me good to read it, and such joy in meeting you. Shall\r\n    I ever be there again, I wonder?--a foolish wonder, and foolisher\r\n    still when let out! Dear old oak-room--to me too Granny Brydone is\r\n    always present there. I _cannot_ think of it without her image\r\n    rising before me. How perfect she was! How far above the common\r\n    world she and Mama, and yet both spending their lives in the\r\n    discharge of common, and what many would call, petty duties! How\r\n    little it signifies what are the special duties to which we are\r\n    called, how much the spirit in which we do them! I don't think I\r\n    ever longed so much for long talks day after day with you. Don't\r\n    say such hopes are visionary, though, alas! they have over and over\r\n    again vanished before our eyes.\r\n\r\n[85] Lady Louisa Howard, formerly Lady Louisa Fitzmaurice (daughter\r\nof Lord Lansdowne), one of Lady Russell's earliest friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lord Amberley_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _October_ 28, 1873\r\n\r\n    DEAREST JOHNNY,--... Rollo bought Mill's autobiography, and I\r\n    have read the greater part of it. Deeply interesting it is, and his\r\n    lovableness comes out in it as much as his intellect--but deeply\r\n    sad too, in more ways than one. I live in dread of the possible\r\n    effect on you and Kate of the account of his education by his\r\n    father--the principles right, the application so wofully wrong.\r\n    Mill was a learned scholar, a great thinker, a good man, partly in\r\n    consequence, partly in spite of it.... Happily you have more Popes\r\n    than one, as good for you as it was for the world in days of old.\r\n    Happily, too, there's such a thing as love, _innate, intuitive,\r\n    instinctive_ (oh, horrible!), which is wise in proportion to its\r\n    depth, and will be your best and safest guide. How strange Mill's\r\n    utter silence about his mother I How beautiful and touching the\r\n    pages about his wife! How melancholy to know that such high natures\r\n    as his and hers generally fail to meet in close intimacy here\r\n    below, and therefore live and die more than half unknown, waiting\r\n    for the hereafter. God bless you, my very dear children.\r\n\r\n    Your loving MOTHER\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _November_ 9, 1873\r\n\r\n    Visit from Mr. Herbert Spencer, who stayed to dinner. Long, deep,\r\n    interesting conversation; all amounting to \"we know nothing,\" he\r\n    assuring me that the prospect of annihilation has no terrors for\r\n    him; I feeling that without immortality life is \"all a cheat,\" and\r\n    without a Father in heaven, right and wrong, love, conscience, joy,\r\n    sorrow, are words without a meaning and the Universe, if governed\r\n    at all, is governed by a malignant spirit who gives us hopes, and\r\n    aspirations never to be fulfilled, affections to be wasted, a\r\n    thirst for knowledge never to be quenched.\r\n\r\n\"1874 opened brightly and peacefully on our dear home,\" she writes; but it\r\nwas to prove one of the saddest years in their lives. Only some of the\r\nheavy trials and sorrows that they were called upon to bear from this time\r\nonward will be touched upon here. They were borne by Lord and Lady Russell\r\nwith heroic courage and unfaltering faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Dunfermline_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _February_ 25, 1874\r\n\r\n    I am now just finishing the \"Heart of Midlothian,\" and with more\r\n    intense admiration for it than ever--the beauty and naturalness of\r\n    every word spoken by Jeanie and Effie _before_ the last\r\n    volume, of a great deal of Davie Deans, of many of the scenes\r\n    scattered through the book are, I think, not to be surpassed. More\r\n    tenderness and depth and heart-breakingness I should say than in\r\n    any of Sir Walter's.... I turned to Sir Walter from \"The\r\n    Parisians.\" I doubt whether I shall finish it, a false, glittering,\r\n    disagreeable atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lord and Lady Amberley_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _March_ 2, 1874\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR CHILDREN,--... We had a charming visit from Sir Henry\r\n    Taylor a few days ago, a long quiet real \"crack\" about many books\r\n    and many authors, with a little touch of the events of the\r\n    day-change of Ministry, causes of our utter defeat, which he thinks\r\n    obscure, so do I--not creditable to the country, so do I--in so far\r\n    as Disraeli can hardly be reckoned more trustworthy or consistent\r\n    than Gladstone, and Gladstone's untrustworthiness and inconsistency\r\n    are supposed to have caused his overthrow. The Queen made Sir John\r\n    Cowell write me a note to find out whether John would be disposed\r\n    to go to the great banquet next Tuesday and sleep at Windsor.\r\n    Kindly done of her--of course he declines. I read Herbert Spencer\r\n    on \"The Bias of Patriotism,\" yesterday--much of it truly excellent.\r\n    To-day I am at \"Progress\" in the Essays ... of which I have read\r\n    several here and there. Whenever I have the feeling that _I_,\r\n    not Herbert Spencer, have written what I am reading, I have the\r\n    delightful sensation of complete agreement and unqualified\r\n    admiration of his (or _my_) wisdom. When I have _not_\r\n    that feeling, I stop to consider, but even then have sometimes the\r\n    candour to come to his conclusions; while at some passages, less\r\n    frequent, I inwardly exclaim, \"I never did, I do not now, and I\r\n    never shall agree.\" The want of what Sir Henry Taylor calls \"the\r\n    spiritual instinct\" is striking in him. It is strange to turn to\r\n    him as I have done from \"Memorials of a Quiet Life,\" which raises\r\n    me into an atmosphere of heavenly calmness and joy, or ought to do\r\n    so, although nobody ever felt the trials and sorrows of life more\r\n    keenly than Mrs. Hare....\r\n\r\n    Good-bye, dearest children, your pets [86] are as well and as dear\r\n    as pets can be.\r\n\r\n    Your loving, MOTHER.\r\n\r\n[86] Rachel and Bertrand, who stayed for the winter at Pembroke Lodge while\r\ntheir parents were abroad.\r\n\r\nIn April Lady Russell lost her sister, Lady Dunfermline, who died in Rome.\r\nIn May, Lord and Lady Russell's second son, who was dearly loved for his\r\ngenerous and noble nature, was seized with dangerous illness. He lived, but\r\nnever recovered. In the summer, Lady Amberley and her little daughter\r\nRachel, who was only six years old, died of diphtheria within a few days of\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nThere is a touching reference to Lord Russell in a letter, written many\r\nyears after his death, from Miss Elliot, daughter of the Dean of Bristol,\r\nto Lady Russell.\r\n\r\n    One of the very last times I saw him you were out, and he sent word\r\n    that he would see me when he knew I was at the door; when he\r\n    literally bowed his head and said, \"The hand of the Lord has been\r\n    very heavy on us--very heavy,\" and spoke of little Rachel. I never\r\n    remember being more touched and awed by the reverence I felt for\r\n    him.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Queen Victoria to Lady Russell_ [87]\r\n\r\n    WINDSOR CASTLE, _June_ 29, 1874\r\n\r\n    DEAR LADY RUSSELL,--I cannot remain silent without writing to\r\n    express to you my deep and sincere sympathy with you both, and\r\n    especially with your poor son on this most sad event, which has\r\n    deprived him of his wife, and his little children (whom I saw so\r\n    lately) of an affectionate mother, in the very prime of life! I saw\r\n    the sad announcement in the papers this morning and could hardly\r\n    believe it, never having heard even of her illness. This sad event\r\n    will, I know, be a terrible blow to you, and to Lord Russell, and I\r\n    know that _you have_ had much sorrow and anxiety lately. Dear\r\n    Lady Russell, I have known you both too long not to feel the truest\r\n    and deepest interest in all that concerns you and yours--in weal\r\n    and woe--and I would not delay a moment in writing to express this\r\n    to you. You will, I know, look for support and for comfort where\r\n    _alone_ it can be found, and I pray that God may support and\r\n    comfort you and your poor bereaved son.\r\n\r\n    Ever yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n    V.R.\r\n\r\n    I should be very grateful if you would let me have any details of\r\n    poor Lady Amberley's illness and death.\r\n\r\n[87] On several occasions Lord Russell had been prevented by the\r\nstate of his health from accepting invitations to Windsor. In\r\nApril, 1874, he and Lady Russell were touched by the Queen's\r\nkindness in coming to visit them at Pembroke Lodge, and she had\r\nthen seen Lord Amberley's children.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Queen Victoria to Lady Russell_\r\n\r\n    WINDSOR CASTLE, _July_ 3, 1874\r\n\r\n    DEAREST LADY RUSSELL,--Your two sad and touching letters have\r\n    affected me deeply, and I thank you much for writing to me. It is\r\n    too dreadful that the dear little girl whose bright eyes and look\r\n    of health I so well remember at Pembroke Lodge should also be\r\n    taken. May God support your poor unhappy son, for whom your heart\r\n    must bleed, and whose agony of grief and bereavement seems almost\r\n    too much to bear. But if he will but trust our Father in Heaven,\r\n    and feel all is sent in love, though he may have to go through\r\n    months and years of the bitterest sufferings, and of anguish\r\n    indescribable, he will find peace and resignation and comfort come\r\n    at last--when it seems farthest. _I_ know this myself. For\r\n    you, dear Lady Russell and dear Lord Russell, I do feel so deeply.\r\n    Your trials have been so great lately.... I shall be really\r\n    grateful if you would write to me again to say how Lord Russell\r\n    bears this new blow, and how your poor son Amberley is. Agatha, who\r\n    is so devoted a daughter, will, I am sure, do all she can now to\r\n    help and comfort you, but she will be deeply distressed herself.\r\n    And poor dear Lady Clarendon is dying I fear, and poor Emily\r\n    Russell only just confined, and unable to go and see her. It is\r\n    dreadful.\r\n\r\n    With fervent prayers that your health may not suffer, and that you\r\n    may be mercifully supported.\r\n\r\n    Ever yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n    V.R.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord Russell to Lady Minto_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _July_ 3, 1874\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR NINA,--We are struck down by the death of my dear pet,\r\n    Rachel, who was taken from us to stay with her parents at\r\n    Ravenscroft. It was but too natural that Kate should wish to have\r\n    her child with her, but the event is heart-breaking--such a\r\n    darling, so bright, so pretty.\r\n\r\n      \"Elle a duré ce que durent les roses,\r\n       L'espace d'un matin.\"\r\n\r\n    I am always touched by those French verses, and now I apply them\r\n    tearfully.\r\n\r\n    Ever yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n    RUSSELL\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1874 Lord Russell took Aldworth, Tennyson's beautiful home\r\nnear Haslemere, where they remained for some months.\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lord Amberley_\r\n\r\n    ALDWORTH, HASLEMERE, _November_ 10, 1874\r\n\r\n    We have been going on in a happy humdrum way since I last\r\n    wrote--humdrum as regards events, and all the happier that it\r\n    should be so--but with no lack of delightful occupation and\r\n    delightful conversation, and that intimate interchange of thought\r\n    which makes home life so much fuller than society life. However, it\r\n    would not do to go on long cut off from the world and its ways and\r\n    from the blessing of the society of real friends, which unluckily\r\n    can't be had without intermixture of wearisome acquaintances.\r\n\r\n    Rollo's reader is reading Molesworth's \"History of England for the\r\n    last Forty Years,\" and Agatha takes advantage and listens, and I\r\n    read it by myself, and as your father knows it all without reading\r\n    it and likes to be talked to about it, we have been living a good\r\n    deal in the great events of that period, and we find it a relief to\r\n    turn from the mazy though deeply interesting flood of metaphysics\r\n    which this age pours upon the world, to facts and events which also\r\n    have their philosophy, and a deep one too.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, December 28, 1874\r\n\r\n    Finished \"Life of Prince Albert.\" It is seldom that a revelation of\r\n    the inner life of Princes would raise the mind to a higher region\r\n    than before--although we all know that they _have_ an inner\r\n    and a real life through the tinsels and the trappings in which we\r\n    see them. But this book can hardly fail to raise any mind, warm any\r\n    heart, brace any soul. Would that we all, in all conditions of\r\n    life, kept truth and duty ever before us, as he did even amid the\r\n    pettinesses of a Court--the solemn trifles of etiquette which would\r\n    have stifled the nobleness of a less noble nature. Would that all\r\n    Princes had a Stockmar, [88] but there are not many Stockmars in\r\n    the world; if there were, there would soon not be many Princes of\r\n    the kind which now abounds, beings cut off from equality,\r\n    friendship, freedom, by what in our supreme folly we call the\r\n    \"necessary\" pomp and fetters of a Court. Noble as Prince Albert\r\n    was, those things did him harm, and as Lady Lyttelton says, nobody\r\n    but the organ knew what was in him.... The Queen appears in a\r\n    charming light--truthfulness, humility, unbounded love for him.\r\n\r\n[88] \"One of the best friends of the Queen and the Prince Consort\r\nwas Baron Stockmar. This old nobleman, who had known the English\r\nCourt since the days of George III, and loved Prince Albert like a\r\nson, was a man of sturdy independence, fearlessly outspoken, and\r\nregarded with affectionate confidence both by Queen Victoria and\r\nher Consort.\"--_Daily News_, May 7, 1910. This was what Lady\r\nRussell felt about him; his fearless outspokenness at Court always\r\nimpressed her.\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lord Amberley_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _December_ 29, 1874\r\n\r\n    M. d'Etchegoyen [89] has given me Mill's three essays. I have read\r\n    \"Nature,\" a great deal of which I like much, but were it to be read\r\n    by the inhabitant of some other planet, he would have a very false\r\n    notion of this one; for Mill dwells almost entirely on the ugly and\r\n    malevolent side of Nature, leaving out of sight the beautiful and\r\n    benevolent side--whereas both abound, and suggest the notion of two\r\n    powers at strife for the government of the world. If you bring the\r\n    \"Conscious Machine Controversy,\" I may read it, although I feel\r\n    very uncharitable to the hard, presumptuous unwisdom of some modern\r\n    metaphysics.\r\n\r\n[89] The Comte and Comtesse d'Etchegoyen (_née_ Talleyrand)\r\nwere intimate friends of Lord and Lady Russell. He was a French\r\nRepublican, who had been obliged to leave Paris at the _Coup\r\nd'État_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lord Amberley_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _March_ 28, 1875\r\n\r\n    This is our Agatha's birthday, and the spirit moves me to write to\r\n    you. Every marked day, whether marked by sorrow or by joy, turns my\r\n    heart, if possible, more than usual to you, and makes me feel more\r\n    keenly how all the joy and perfect happiness once yours has been\r\n    turned to bitter sorrow and desolation. I find it is far, far more\r\n    difficult to bear grief for one's children than for oneself, and\r\n    sometimes my heart \"has been like to break\" as I have followed you\r\n    in thought on your long and dreary journey, and remembered what\r\n    your companionship was when last you went to the sunny South, to so\r\n    many of the same places. You have indeed been sorely tried, my\r\n    child, and you have not--would that I could give it to you--the one\r\n    and only rock of refuge and consolation, of faith in the wisdom and\r\n    mercy of a God of love. But I trust in Him for you, and I know that\r\n    though clouds hide Him from your sight, He will care for you and\r\n    not forsake you--and even here on earth I look forward to much\r\n    peaceful happiness for you, in your children, in books, in nature,\r\n    in duties zealously done, in the love and sympathy of many--\"Mutter\r\n    Treu ist ewig neu,\" and that you may find some rest to your aching\r\n    heart in that Mutter Treue, which is always hovering round you,\r\n    wherever you are, and to which every day seems to add fresh\r\n    strength and renewed longing to give you comfort, is my daily,\r\n    nightly hope and prayer. May this letter find you well and cheerful\r\n    and able to enjoy the loveliness of sea and sky and mountain; if\r\n    so, I know it will not sadden you to get this drop out of the ocean\r\n    of my thoughts about you--thoughts which the freshness of the\r\n    wounds makes it intensely difficult for me to utter.... Kiss my two\r\n    precious little boys and keep us in their memory. Is Bertrand as\r\n    full of fun and merriment as he used to be? Poor pets! they look to\r\n    you for all the tenderness of father and mother combined in order\r\n    to be as happy as children ought to be. Give it them largely, my\r\n    child, as it is in your nature to do.... God bless you all.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1875, Lady Russell notes in her diary that her husband had\r\nwritten a letter to the _Times_ giving his support to the Herzegovina\r\ninsurgents. During the few years preceding 1876 he had become convinced\r\nthat the days of Turkish misrule in the Christian provinces must be ended.\r\n[90] He frequently spoke with indignation of the systematic murders\r\ncontrived by the Turkish Government and officials, and felt that the cause\r\nof the oppressed Christians deserved support, and that the time for\r\nupholding the rule of the Sultan as a cardinal principle in our policy had\r\npassed. He threw himself with the greatest heartiness into a movement for\r\nthe aid of the insurgents. Though in his eighty-third year he was the first\r\nBritish statesman to break with the past and to bless the uprising of\r\nliberty in the near East. In the following letter, written from Caprera on\r\nSeptember 17, 1875, the generous sympathy between him and Garibaldi found\r\nfresh expression.\r\n\r\n[90] In 1874 he wrote that from Adrianople to Belgrade all government\r\nshould be in the hands of the Christians.\r\n\r\n    MON ILLUSTRE AMI,--En associant votre grand nom au bien-faiteurs\r\n    des Chrétiens opprimés par le Gouvernement Turc, vous avez ajouté\r\n    un bien precieux bijou a la couronne humanitaire qui ceint votre\r\n    noble front. En 1860 votre parole sublime sonna en faveur des\r\n    Rayahs Italiens, et l'Italie n'est plus une expression\r\n    géographique. Aujourd'hui vous plaidez la cause des Rayahs Turcs,\r\n    plus malheureux encore. C'est une cause qui vaincra comme la\r\n    premiere, et Dieu bénira vos vieux ans.... Je baise la main à votre\r\n    precieuse épouse, et suis pour la vie votre devoué G. GARIBALDI.\r\n    [91]\r\n\r\n[91] \"MY ILLUSTRIOUS FRIEND,--In associating your great name with the\r\nbenefactors of the Christians oppressed by the Turkish Government, you have\r\nadded a most precious jewel to the crown of humanity which encircles your\r\nnoble brow. In 1860 your sublime word was spoken in favour of the Italian\r\nRayahs, and Italy is no longer only a geographical expression. To-day you\r\nplead the cause of the Turkish Rayahs, even more unhappy. It is a cause\r\nwhich will conquer like the first, and God will bless your old age. I kiss\r\nthe hand of your dear wife, and remain for life your devoted G. GARIBALDI.\"\r\n\r\nAbout a year later Lady Russell writes: \"Great meetings at the Guildhall\r\nand Exeter Hall--fine spirit-stirring speech of Fawcett at the last. The\r\nfeeling of the nation makes me proud, as it does to remember that John was\r\nthe first to foresee the magnitude of the coming storm, when the first\r\ngrumblings were heard in Herzegovina--the first to feel sympathy with the\r\ninsurgents.... Many a nation may be roused to a sense of its own wrongs,\r\nbut to see a whole people fired with indignation for the wrongs of another\r\nand a remote country, with no selfish afterthought, no possible prospect of\r\nadvantage to what are called 'British Interests,' is grand indeed.\"\r\n\r\nThe last entry calls to mind a passage by Mr. Froude in the Life of Lord\r\nBeaconsfield [92]:\r\n\r\n\"The spirit of a great nation called into energy on a grand occasion is one\r\nof the noblest of human phenomena. The pseudo-national spirit of Jingoism\r\nis the meanest and the most dangerous.\"\r\n\r\n[92] \"Life of the Earl of Beaconsfield,\" J.A. Froude, p. 251.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1876 Lord Russell still retained so much health and\r\nvigour that his doctor spoke of him as being in some respects \"like a man\r\nin the prime of life.\" But another great sorrow now befell them. Their\r\neldest son, Lord Amberley, died on January 9th. He was only thirty-three.\r\nIn his short life he had shown great independence of mind and unusual\r\nability. His two boys [93] now came to live permanently at Pembroke Lodge.\r\nSomething of his character may be gathered from the following letter from\r\nDr. Jowett, who had known him well at Oxford.\r\n\r\n    _Professor Jowett to Lady Russell_\r\n\r\n    _January_ 14, 1876\r\n\r\n    I am grieved to hear of the death of Lord Amberley; I read it by\r\n    accident in the newspaper of yesterday. I fear it must be a\r\n    terrible blow both to you and Lord Russell.\r\n\r\n    I will not intrude upon your sorrow, but I would like to tell you\r\n    what I thought of him. He was one of the best men I ever knew--most\r\n    truthful and disinterested. He was not of the world, and therefore\r\n    not likely to be popular with the world. He had chosen a path which\r\n    was very difficult, and could hardly have been carried out in\r\n    practical politics. I think that latterly he saw this and was\r\n    content to live seeking after the truth in the companionship of his\r\n    wife, whose memory I shall always cherish. Some persons may grieve\r\n    over them because they had not the ordinary hopes and consolations\r\n    of religion. This does not add to my sorrow for them except in so\r\n    far as it deprived them of sympathy and happiness while they were\r\n    living. It must inevitably happen in these times, when everything\r\n    is made the subject of inquiry with many good persons. God does not\r\n    regard men with reference to their opinion about Himself or about a\r\n    future world, but with reference to what they really are. In\r\n    holding fast to truth and righteousness they held the greater part\r\n    of what we mean by belief in God. No person's religious opinions\r\n    affect the truth either about themselves or others. One who said to\r\n    me what I have said to you about your son's remarkable goodness\r\n    (while condemning his opinions) was Lady Augusta Stanley,[94] who\r\n    herself, I fear, has not long to live.\r\n\r\n[93] Frank (afterwards Earl Russell), who was then ten years old,\r\nand Bertrand, three years old.\r\n\r\n[94] Wife of Dean Stanley.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Dean Stanley (Dean of Westminster) to Lady Russell_\r\n\r\n    DEAR LADY RUSSELL,--Will you allow one broken heart to say a word\r\n    of sympathy to another?--the life of my life is ebbing away--the\r\n    hope of your life is gone. She, I trust, will find in the fountain\r\n    of all Love the love in which she has trusted on earth. He, I\r\n    trust, will find in the fountain of all Light the truth after which\r\n    he sought on earth. May God help us both in His love.\r\n\r\n    Ever yours most truly,\r\n\r\n    A.P. STANLEY\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Queen Victoria to Lady Russell_\r\n\r\n    OSBORNE, _January_ 11, 1876\r\n\r\n    DEAR LADY RUSSELL,--My heart bleeds for you. A new and very heavy\r\n    blow has fallen upon you, who were already so sorely tried! Most\r\n    deep and sincere is my sympathy with you and Lord Russell, and I\r\n    cannot say how I feel for you. It is so terrible to see one's\r\n    children go before one! You will be a mother to the orphans and the\r\n    fatherless, as I know how kind and loving you were always to them.\r\n\r\n    Trusting that your health will not suffer, and asking you to\r\n    remember me to Agatha, who will be a great comfort to you, as she\r\n    has ever been, believe me always,\r\n\r\n    Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n    V.R.\r\n\r\nIn March they began once more to see their friends. \"Seeing those I have\r\nnot yet seen,\" she writes, \"is like meeting them after years--so changed is\r\nour world.\"\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _March_ 15, 1876\r\n\r\n    The dear old beech-tree in the wood blown down, and with it\r\n    countless recollections of happy hours under its shade with merry\r\n    boys climbing it above our heads, and little Agatha playing at our\r\n    feet, and her elder sisters chatting with us and looking for nests\r\n    and flowers. All, all gone. The bitter gales of sorrow have blown\r\n    down our fair hopes and turned our joys to sorrow. Poor old\r\n    beech-tree! Like us, it had lost its fair boughs; like it, we shall\r\n    soon lay down our stripped and shattered stems.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _April_ 25, 1876\r\n\r\n    The loveliness of early spring--its nameless, countless tints, its\r\n    music and its flowers, never went deeper into my soul--but oh! the\r\n    happy springtide of life, where is that?\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Charlotte Portal_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _January 27_, 1877\r\n\r\n    Do not grieve too much over all our trials, dear Lotty. We have not\r\n    long to bear them now, and all will be made clear by and by. All\r\n    the sorrows of all the world will be seen in their true light, and\r\n    tears will be wiped from all eyes for ever. I often think, though I\r\n    try to drive away the thought, how unspeakably soothing and happy\r\n    it would have been to look back upon blows as must fall to the lot\r\n    of all who live long, instead of to a life of many strange and\r\n    unexpected and terrible shocks of many kinds. But oftener, far\r\n    oftener, I feel the brightness and blessedness of my lot; so bright\r\n    and so blessed in many wonderful ways; and never, never at any\r\n    moment would I have exchanged it for another. Dearest Lotty, your\r\n    loving letter has brought all this upon you, and it shall go with\r\n    all its selfishness to Laverstoke, and not into the fire, where I\r\n    am inclined to put it.... God bless you, dear Lotty.\r\n\r\n    Your loving sister,\r\n\r\n    F.R.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Charlotte Portal_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _January_ 4, 1878\r\n\r\n    I am reading the third volume of Prince Albert, and love and admire\r\n    him more and more--but am very angry with the book as regards John:\r\n    the unfairness from omission of all particulars which he alone\r\n    could have given with regard to his resignation on Roebuck's\r\n    motion, and his non-resignation after Vienna, is something I cannot\r\n    forgive.\r\n\r\nEarly in this year, 1878, Lady Russell writes of a dinner-party at Lord\r\nSelborne's:\r\n\r\n    Agatha and I dined in town, with the Selbornes. I between Lord\r\n    Selborne and Gladstone, who was as usual most agreeable and most\r\n    eloquent, giving life and fervour to conversation whatever was the\r\n    subject. \"The Eastern Question,\" the \"Life of Prince Albert,\" the\r\n    comedy of \"Diplomacy,\" the different degrees of \"parliamentary\r\n    courage\" in different statesmen, etc. He said that in his opinion\r\n    Sir Robert Peel, my husband, and, \"I must give the devil his due,\"\r\n    Disraeli, were the three statesmen whom he had known who had the\r\n    most \"parliamentary courage.\"\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1877 Lord Russell had taken a house overlooking the sea\r\nnear Broadstairs. But he was falling into a gradual decline, the\r\nconsequence of great age, and after they came home from Broadstairs, he\r\nnever again left Pembroke Lodge.\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Charlotte Portal_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _January_ 11, 1878\r\n\r\n    Do not think too much of the pain to me, but of the mercy of there\r\n    being none to him, in this gradual extinction of a mind which gave\r\n    light to so many, of affections which made home so happy. My worst\r\n    pain is over--was over long ago--the pain of first acknowledging to\r\n    myself my own loneliness, without the guide, the example, the\r\n    support, which so long were mine--without those golden joys of\r\n    perfect companionship which made the hours fly when we sat and\r\n    talked together on many an evening of blessed memory, or strolled\r\n    together among our trees and our flowers, or snatched a few moments\r\n    together from his days and nights of noble toil in London. All this\r\n    is over, all this and much more, but gratitude that it _has\r\n    been_ remains, and the bright hope of a renewal of companionship\r\n    hereafter gives strength and courage for present duties and passing\r\n    trials.\r\n\r\nMr. George W.E. Russell, in the closing passage of an article on his\r\nuncle, [95] wrote of these last years of his life: \"... Thus in peace and\r\ndignity that long life of public and private virtue neared its close; in a\r\nhome made bright by the love of friends and children, and tended by the\r\ndevotion of her who for more than five-and-thirty years had been the good\r\nangel of her husband's house.\"\r\n\r\n[95] _Contemporary Review_, December, 1889.\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _April_ 19, 1878\r\n\r\n    I have just been sitting with my dearest husband; he has said\r\n    precious words such as I did not expect ever to hear from him, for\r\n    his mind is seldom, very seldom clear. We were holding one\r\n    another's hands: \"I hope I haven't given you much trouble.\" \"How,\r\n    dearest?\" \"In watching over me.\" Then by and by he said, \"I have\r\n    made mistakes, but in all I did my object was the public good.\"\r\n    Again, \"I have sometimes seemed cold to my friends--but it was not\r\n    in my heart.\" He said he had enjoyed his life. I said, \"I hope you\r\n    enjoy it now.\" He said, \"Yes, except that I am too much confined to\r\n    my bed.... I'm very old--I'm eighty-five.\" He then talked of his\r\n    birthday being in July. I told him it was in August, but our\r\n    wedding-day was in July, and it would be thirty-seven years next\r\n    July since we were married. He said, \"Oh, I'm so glad we've passed\r\n    it so happily together.\" I said I had not always been so good to\r\n    him as I ought to have been. \"Oh yes, you have, very good indeed.\"\r\n    At another moment he said, \"I'm quite ready to go now.\" Asked him\r\n    where to? \"To my grave, to my death.\" He also said, \"Do you see me\r\n    sometimes placing my hands in this way?\" (he was clasping them\r\n    together). \"That always means devotion--that I am asking God to be\r\n    good to me.\" His voice was much broken by tears as he said these\r\n    things.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _April_ 20, 1878\r\n\r\n    Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone to tea. Both most cordial and kind. Mr.\r\n    Gladstone in his most agreeable mood. Eastern Question only\r\n    slightly touched. Other subjects: increase of drunkenness;\r\n    Northumberland election, which has raised his spirits, whether\r\n    Albert Grey be returned or not; Life of Prince Albert, whom he\r\n    admires heartily, but who according to him (and John) did not\r\n    understand the British Constitution. Called Stockmar a \"mischievous\r\n    old prig.\" Said \"Liberty is never safe,\" that even in this country\r\n    an unworthy sovereign might endanger her even now. John sent down\r\n    to say he wished to see them. I took them to him for a few\r\n    minutes--happily he was clear in his mind--and said to Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, \"I'm sorry you are not in the Ministry,\" and kissed her\r\n    affectionately, and was so cordial to both that they were greatly\r\n    touched.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _May_ 9, 1878\r\n\r\n    Great day. Nonconformist deputation presented address to John on\r\n    the fiftieth anniversary of Repeal of the Corporation and Test\r\n    Acts. Alas! that he could not see them. All cordial and friendly,\r\n    and some with strikingly good countenances. Edmond Fitzmaurice\r\n    happened to call, stayed, and spoke admirably. Lord Spencer also\r\n    called just before they came to congratulate him, but I stupidly\r\n    did not think of asking him to stay. Those of the deputation who\r\n    spoke did so extremely well. It was a proud and a sad day. We had\r\n    hoped some time ago that he might perhaps see the deputation for a\r\n    moment in his room, but he was too ill for that to be possible.\r\n\r\nLord Russell died on May 28, 1878, at Pembroke Lodge.\r\n\r\n    _Queen Victoria to Lady Russell_\r\n\r\n    BALMORAL, _May_ 30, 1878\r\n\r\n    DEAR LADY RUSSELL,--It was only yesterday afternoon I learnt\r\n    through the papers that your dear husband had left this world of\r\n    sorrows and trials peacefully, and full of years, the night before,\r\n    or I would have telegraphed or written sooner! You will believe\r\n    that I truly regret an old friend of forty years' standing, and\r\n    whose personal kindness in trying and anxious times I shall\r\n    _ever_ remember. \"Lord John,\" as I knew him best, was one of\r\n    my first and most distinguished Ministers, and his departure\r\n    recalls many eventful times. To you, dear Lady Russell, who were\r\n    ever one of the most devoted of wives, this must be a terrible\r\n    blow, though you must have for some time been prepared for it. But\r\n    one is such trials and sorrows of late years that I most truly\r\n    sympathize with you. Your dear and devoted daughter will, I know,\r\n    be the greatest possible comfort to you, and I trust that your\r\n    grandsons will grow up to be all that you could wish.\r\n\r\n    Believe me always, yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n    V.R.I.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Mr. John Bright to Lady Russell_\r\n\r\n    _June_ 1, 1878\r\n\r\n    DEAR LADY RUSSELL,--... What I particularly observed in the\r\n    public life of Lord John--you once told me you liked his former\r\n    name and title--was a moral tone, a conscientious feeling,\r\n    something higher and better than is often found in the guiding\r\n    principle of our most active statesmen, and for this I always\r\n    admired and reverenced him. His family may learn from him, his\r\n    country may and will cherish his memory. You alone can tell what\r\n    you have lost....\r\n\r\n    Ever very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n    JOHN BRIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Minto to Lady Russell_\r\n\r\n    _June_ 4, 1878\r\n\r\n    I have been thinking of you all day, and indeed through many hours\r\n    of the night.... I rather wished to hear that the Abbey was to have\r\n    been his resting place--but after all it matters little since his\r\n    abiding place is in the pages of English history.... What none\r\n    could thoroughly appreciate except those who lived in his intimacy\r\n    was the perfect simplicity which made him the most easily amused of\r\n    men, ready to pour out his stores of anecdote to old and young--to\r\n    discuss opinions on a level with the most humble of interlocutors,\r\n    and take pleasure in the commonest forms of pleasantness--a fine\r\n    day, a bright flower. Nor do I think that the outside world\r\n    understood from what depth of feeling the tears rose to his eyes\r\n    when tales of noble conduct or any high sentiment touched some\r\n    responsive chord--nor how much \"poetic fire\" lay under that\r\n    _calm,_ not cold manner.... I remember often going down to you\r\n    when London was full of some political anger against him--when\r\n    personalities and bitterness were rife--and returning _from_\r\n    you with the feeling of having been in another world, so entire was\r\n    the absence of such bitterness, so gentle and peaceful were the\r\n    impressions I carried away.\r\n\r\nLady Russell went with her family early in July to St. Fillans, in\r\nPerthshire, for a few months of perfect quiet among the Scotch lakes and\r\nmountains. Queen Victoria's kindness in asking her to remain at Pembroke\r\nLodge was a great comfort to her.\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Charlotte Portal_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _June_ 30, 1878\r\n\r\n    Just a word with you, my own Lotty, before leaving home. Oh the\r\n    blessing of being still able to call it home, darkened for ever as\r\n    it is, for the multiplying memories with which it is thronged make\r\n    it dearer as well as sadder every day of my life! Lotty, shall I\r\n    ever believe that he has left me, quite left me, never to return?\r\n    Will the fearful silence ever cease to startle me? Whenever I came\r\n    in from a walk or a drive I used to know almost before I opened his\r\n    door, by the sound of his voice, or of _something,_ whether\r\n    all was well with him, and now there is only that deadly silence.\r\n    And yet, I often feel if I had but courage to go in, surely I\r\n    _must_ find him, surely he _must_ be waiting for me and\r\n    wanting me. But how foolish to talk of any _one_ form of this\r\n    unutterable blank, which meets me at every turn, intertwined with\r\n    everything I say or do, and taking a new shape every moment, and\r\n    the yearning and the aching which have been my portion for four\r\n    years--the yearning for my other lost loved ones, for my dear, dear\r\n    boys, seems more terrible than ever now that this too has come upon\r\n    me.... I pass my husband's sitting-room window--there are the roses\r\n    he loved so well, hanging over them in all their summer beauty, but\r\n    he does not call me to give him one. I come in, and there on the\r\n    walls of my room are pictures of the three, but not one of them\r\n    answers me--silence, nothing but deadly silence! I know all is\r\n    well, and I feel in my inmost heart that this last sorrow is a\r\n    blessed one, saving us from far worse, and taking him to his rest,\r\n    and I never for a moment forget what treasures beyond price are\r\n    left to my old age still.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n1878-98\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Russell survived her husband nearly twenty years. From the time of\r\nLord Russell's death in May, 1878, till 1890, she kept no diary, but not\r\nlong before her death she wrote for her children a few recollections of\r\nsome of the events during those twelve years.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1880, Lady Victoria Villiers died, leaving a widowed husband and\r\nmany children. Her death was a great sorrow to Lady Russell, who wrote of\r\nher as \"a perfect wife and mother.\"\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1883 her son Rollo bought a place--Dunrozel--near\r\nHaslemere, and from this time till 1891 Lady Russell spent a few months\r\nevery year at Dunrozel.[96] In 1891 and 1892 she took a house on\r\nHindhead--some miles from Haslemere--for a few months. She enjoyed and\r\nloved the beautiful wild heather country, which reminded her of Scotland,\r\nbut after 1892 she felt that home was best for her, and never again left\r\nPembroke Lodge.\r\n\r\n[96] They named it Dunrozel after Rozel in Normandy, supposed to be the\r\noriginal home of the Russells.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 the marriage of her son Rollo to Miss Alice Godfrey was a great\r\nhappiness to her. But in little more than a year, soon after the birth of a\r\nson, Mrs. Rollo Russell died, and again Lady Russell suffered deeply, for\r\nshe always found the sorrows of her children harder to bear than her own.\r\n\r\nTo retire more and more from the world of many engagements and important\r\naffairs was easy to her, easier than it proves to many who have figured\r\nthere with less distinction. Playing a prominent part in that world does\r\nnot make people happy; but, as a rule, it prevents them from being\r\ncontented with anything else. It was not so with her; in the days most\r\ncrowded with successes and excitements her thoughts kept flying home. She\r\nhad always felt that a quiet, busy family life was the one most natural to\r\nher. When she was a girl at Minto, helping to educate her younger brothers\r\nand sisters, she had written in her diary:\r\n\r\n    _August_ 26, 1836\r\n\r\n    Chiefly unto children, O Lord, do I feel myself called; in them I\r\n    see Thy image reflected more pure than in anything else in this\r\n    sinful though beautiful world, and in serving them my love to Thee\r\n    increases.\r\n\r\nHer wish was fulfilled to an unusual degree. One of a large family of\r\nbrothers and sisters, she was still helping in the education of the younger\r\nones when she married, and her marriage at once brought her the care of a\r\nyoung family; soon, too, children of her own; while her old age brought her\r\nthe charge of successive grandchildren. During the lifetime of Lord and\r\nLady Amberley their children often spent many months at Pembroke Lodge\r\nwhile their parents were abroad, and when both father and mother had died\r\nthe two boys came to live with their grandparents. Ten years later her\r\nyoungest son's boy was brought to her on the day of his mother's death,\r\nwhen he was two months old, and remained with her till her son's second\r\nmarriage in 1891. The children of her stepdaughters were also loving\r\ngrandchildren to her, and often came for long visits to Pembroke Lodge.\r\n\r\nLady Russell had sometimes thought that when days of leisure came, she\r\nwould give some of her time to literary work, and write reminiscences of\r\nthe many interesting men and women she had known and the stirring events\r\nshe had lived through; but the unexpected and daily cares and duties which\r\ncame upon her made this impossible. [97] She was one who would never\r\nneglect the living needs of those around her, and she gave her time and\r\nthoughts to the care of her grandchildren with glad and loving devotion.\r\n\r\n[97] The only book Lady Russell published was \"Family Worship\"; a small\r\nvolume of selections from the Bible and prayers for daily use. It was first\r\npublished in 1876.\r\n\r\nOne of her greatest pleasures was to see her own ideals and enthusiasms\r\nreflected in the young; and next to the care of her family the prosperity\r\nof the village school at Petersham was perhaps nearest her heart. It grew\r\nand flourished through her devotion. In 1891 it was generously taken over\r\nby the British and Foreign School Society, but the change made no\r\ndifference to her interest nor to the time she gave to it. The warm\r\naffection of the people of Petersham was a great happiness to her; after\r\nlong illness and enforced absence from the village she wrote to her\r\ndaughter: \"You can't think what good it did me to see a village friend\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nThe feeling among the villagers may be gathered from two brief passages in\r\nletters written after her death: a gardener in Petersham alluded to her as\r\n\"our much-loved friend, Countess Russell,\" and another man--who had been\r\neducated at Petersham School--wrote: \"She was really like a mother to many\r\nof we 'Old Scholars.'\"\r\n\r\nLady Russell's letters will show that her interest in politics remained as\r\nkeen as ever to the end; and she eagerly watched the changes which affected\r\nIreland. To the end of her life she retained the fervour of her youthful\r\nRadicalism, and with advancing years her religious opinions became more and\r\nmore broad. To her there was no infallibility in any Bible, any prophet,\r\nany Church. With an ever-deepening reverence for the life and teaching of\r\nJesus, she yet felt that \"The highest Revelation is not made by Christ, but\r\ncomes directly from the Universal Mind to our minds.\" [98] Her last public\r\nappearance in Richmond was at the opening of the new Free Church, on April\r\n16, 1896, which she had joined some years before as being the community\r\nholding views nearer to her own than any other.\r\n\r\n[98] Rev. F.W. Robertson, of Brighton. Sermons, 1st Series.\r\n\r\nThere is a side of Lady Russell's mind which her letters do not adequately\r\nrepresent. She was a great reader, and in her letters (written off with\r\nsurprising rapidity) she does not often say much about the books she was so\r\nfond of discussing in talk. Among novelists, Sir Walter Scott was perhaps\r\nthe one she read most often; Jane Austen too was a favourite; but she also\r\nmuch enjoyed many of the later novelists, especially Charles Dickens and\r\nGeorge Eliot.\r\n\r\nIn poetry her taste was in some respects the taste of an earlier\r\ngeneration; she could not join, for instance, in the depreciation of Byron,\r\nnor could she sympathize with the unbounded admiration for Keats which she\r\nmet with among the young. Milton, Cowper, Burns, Byron, and Longfellow were\r\namong those oftenest read, but Shakespeare always remained supreme, and as\r\nthe years went by her wonder and admiration seemed only to grow stronger\r\nand deeper with every fresh reading of his greatest plays; and the\r\nintervals without some Shakespeare reading, either aloud or to herself,\r\nwere short and rare. She had not an intimate knowledge of Shelley, but in\r\nthe later years of her life she became deeply impressed by the beauty and\r\nmusic of his poetry, which she liked best to hear read aloud.\r\n\r\nTennyson she loved, and latterly also Browning, with protests against his\r\nobscurity and his occasionally most unmusical English. The inspiration of\r\nhis brave and optimistic philosophy she felt strongly. She was extremely\r\nfond of reading Dante, and she was better acquainted with German and\r\nItalian poetry than most cultivated women. But though she read much and\r\noften in the works of famous writers, this did not prevent her keeping\r\nabreast with the literature of the day. She was strongly attracted by\r\nspeculative books, not too technical, and by the works of theologians whose\r\nviews were broad and tolerant of doubt. In 1847 she mentions reading some\r\nof Dr. Channing's writings \"with the greatest delight\"; and some years\r\nafterwards she wrote: \"Began 'Life of Channing'; interesting in the highest\r\ndegree--an echo of all those high and noble thoughts of which this earth is\r\nnot yet worthy, but which I firmly believe will one day reign on it\r\nsupreme.\" In later years she was deeply impressed by the writings of Dr.\r\nMartineau, and read many of his books. But she was not interested in\r\nphilosophical inquiry for its own sake; it was the importance of the moral\r\nand religious issues at stake in such discussions that attracted her.\r\nHistory and biography it was natural she should read eagerly, and it was\r\ncharacteristic of her to praise and condemn actions long past with an\r\nintensity such as is usually excited by contemporary events. Until a few\r\nyears before her death she rose early to secure a space of time for reading\r\nand meditation before the duties of the day began. Unless ill-health could\r\nbe pleaded, fiction and light reading were banished from the morning hours.\r\nShe believed in strict adherence to such self-imposed sumptuary\r\nregulations, whether they applied to the body or to the pleasures of the\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nIn the course of her long life she became personally acquainted with nearly\r\nall the principal writers of the Victorian era, and some of them she knew\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest friends of Lord and Lady John Russell were Sydney Smith,\r\nThomas Moore, and Macaulay. There is a note in verse written by Lady John\r\nto Samuel Rogers, which will serve at least to suggest how readily her\r\nfancy and good spirits might run into rhyme on the occasion of some family\r\nrejoicing or for a children's play.\r\n\r\n    _To Mr. Rogers, who was expected to breakfast and forgot to\r\n    come_\r\n\r\n    CHESHAM PLACE, 1843\r\n\r\n      When a poet a lady offends\r\n        Is it prose her forgiveness obtains?\r\n      And from Rogers can less make amends\r\n        Than the humblest and sweetest of strains?\r\n\r\n      In glad expectation our board\r\n        With roses and lilies we graced;\r\n      But alas! the bard kept not his word,\r\n        He came not for whom they were placed.\r\n\r\n      Sad and silent our toast we bespread,\r\n        At the empty chair looked we and sighed;\r\n      All insipid tea, butter, and bread,\r\n        For the salt of his wit was denied.\r\n\r\n      Now in wrath we acknowledge how well\r\n        He the \"Pleasures of Memory\" who drew,\r\n      For mankind from his magical shell\r\n        Gives the \"Pains of Forgetfulness\" too.\r\n\r\nRogers wrote in answer:--\r\n\r\n    CARA, CARISSIMA, CRUDELISSIMA,--If such is to be the reward for my\r\n    transgressions, what crimes shall I not commit before I die? I\r\n    shall shoot Victoria to-day, and Louis Philippe to-morrow.\r\n\r\n    But to be serious, I am at a loss how to thank you as I ought. How\r\n    I lament that I have hung my harp upon the willow!\r\n\r\n    Yours ever,\r\n\r\n    S.R.\r\n\r\nIn later years Thackeray and Charles Dickens were welcome guests, and the\r\ncordial friendship between Lord and Lady John and Dickens lasted till his\r\ndeath in 1870. Dickens said in a speech at Liverpool in 1869 that \"there\r\nwas no man in England whom he respected more in his public capacity, loved\r\nmore in his private capacity, or from whom he had received more remarkable\r\nproofs of his honour and love of literature than Lord John Russell.\"\r\n\r\nAmong poets, Tennyson and Browning were true friends; Longfellow also\r\nvisited Pembroke Lodge, and impressed Lady Russell by his gentle and\r\nspiritual nature; and Lowell was one of her most agreeable guests. With Sir\r\nHenry Taylor, whose \"Philip van Artevelde\" she admired, the intercourse\r\nwas, from her youth to old age, intimate and affectionate.\r\n\r\nMr. Lecky, a faithful friend, gave a picture of the society at Pembroke\r\nLodge, which may be quoted here:\r\n\r\nFor some years after Lord Russell's retirement from ministerial life he\r\ngathered around him at Pembroke Lodge a society that could hardly be\r\nequalled--certainly not surpassed--in England. In the summer Sunday\r\nafternoons there might be seen beneath the shade of those majestic oaks\r\nnearly all that was distinguished in English politics, and much that was\r\ndistinguished in English literature, and few eminent foreigners visited\r\nEngland without making a pilgrimage to the old statesman. [99]\r\n\r\n[99] \"Life of Lord John Russell,\" by Stuart J. Reid, p. 351.\r\n\r\nMr. Frederic Harrison was one of Lady Russell's best friends in the last\r\nyears of her life, and her keen interest in the Irish Question brought her\r\ninto close and intimate intercourse with Mr. Justin McCarthy, who knew her\r\nso well in these days of busy and sequestered old age that his\r\nrecollections, given in the last chapter of this volume, are valuable.\r\n\r\nAmong the men of science she knew best were Sir Richard Owen, a near\r\nneighbour in Richmond Park, Sir Joseph Hooker, and Professor Tyndall, one\r\nof the most genial and delightful of her guests.\r\n\r\nThere is a passage in Sir Henry Taylor's autobiography which speaks of her\r\nin earlier times, but it expresses an impression she made till her death on\r\nmany who met her:\r\n\r\nI have been rather social lately, ... and went to a party at Lord John\r\nRussell's, where I met the Archbishop of York.... A better meeting was with\r\nLady Lotty Elliot, the one of the Minto Elliots who is now about the age\r\nthat her elder sisters were when I first knew them some sixteen or eighteen\r\nyears ago.... They are a fine set of girls and women, those Minto Elliots,\r\nfull of literature and poetry and nature; and Lady John, whom I knew best\r\nin former days, is still very attractive to me; and now that she is\r\nrelieved from the social toils of a First Minister's wife, I mean to renew\r\nand improve my relations with her, if she has no objection.... She is very\r\ninteresting to me, as having kept herself pure from the world with a fresh\r\nand natural and not ungifted mind in the world's most crowded ways. I\r\nrecollect some years ago going through the heart of the City, somewhere\r\nbehind Cheapside, to have come upon a courtyard of an antique house, with\r\ngrass and flowers and green trees growing as quietly as if it was the\r\ngarden of a farm-house in Northumberland. Lady John reminds me of it.\r\n\r\nThe charm of her company, apart from the kindliness of her manner, lay in\r\nan immediate responsiveness to all that was going on around her, and the\r\nsense her talk and presence conveyed of a life controlled by a homely,\r\ndignified, strenuous tradition. It was the spontaneity of her sympathy\r\nwhich all her life long drew to her defenders, dispirited or hopeful, of\r\nstruggling causes, and so many idealists, confident or resigned, shabby or\r\nadmired. Any with a cause at heart, an end to aim at beyond personal ends,\r\nfound in her a companion who seemed at once to understand how bitter were\r\nthe checks or how important the triumphs they had met, and to them her\r\ncompany was a singular refreshment and inspiration, amid the polite or\r\nundisguised indifference of the world. She could listen with ardour; and if\r\nthis sympathy was there for comparative strangers, still more was it at the\r\nservice of those who possessed her affection. She reflected instantaneously\r\ntheir joys and troubles; indeed, she made both so much her own that those\r\nshe loved were often tempted at first to hide their troubles from her. Such\r\nnatures cannot usually disguise their emotions, and though she could\r\nconceal her own physical sufferings so as almost to mislead those with whom\r\nshe lived, her feelings were plainly legible. If anything was said in her\r\npresence which pained her, her distress was visible in a moment; and as a\r\nbeautiful consequence of this transparent expressiveness, her gaiety was\r\ninfectious and her affection shone out upon those she loved with tenderest\r\nradiance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter Lord Russell's death political events can no longer be used as a\r\nthread to connect her letters and other writings together; but the\r\nfollowing passages, chosen over many years, will, it is hoped, give to\r\nthose who never knew her some idea of her as she is remembered by those who\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nOn Lady Georgiana Peel's first birthday after the death of her father Lady\r\nRussell sent her the following verses:\r\n\r\n    To GEORGY\r\n\r\n    _For her Birthday, February 6, 1879._\r\n\r\n    TUNE: _\"Lochnagar.\"_\r\n\r\n      What music so early, so gently awakes me,\r\n        And why as I listen these fast falling tears;\r\n      And what is the magic that so swiftly takes me\r\n        Far back on my road, o'er the dust of dead years?\r\n\r\n      Voice of the past, in thy sweetness and sadness\r\n        Thy magic enthralling, thy beauty and power,\r\n      Oh voice of the past! in thy deep holy sadness,\r\n        I know thee and yield to thee one little hour.\r\n\r\n      Once more rings the birthday with merry young laughter,\r\n        Our bairnies once more are around us at play;\r\n      Their little hearts reck not of what may come after,\r\n        As lightly they weave the fresh flowers of to-day.\r\n\r\n      Now to thy father's loved hand gaily clinging,\r\n        To ask for the kiss he stoops fondly to gi'e;\r\n      To his care-laden spirit once more thou art bringing\r\n        The freshness of thine, bonny winsome wee Gee![100]\r\n\r\n      Thy rosy young cheek to my own thou art pressing,\r\n        Thy little arms twining around me I feel.\r\n      And thy Father in Heaven to thank for each blessing,\r\n        I see thee beside me in innocence kneel.\r\n\r\n      When the dread shadow of sickness is o'er me,\r\n        I see thee, a lassie all brightness and bloom;\r\n      Still, still through thy tears strewing blossoms before me,\r\n        Still watching beside me through silence and gloom.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Hushed now is the music! and hushed be my weeping\r\n        For days that return not and light that hath fled.\r\n      No more from their rest may I summon the sleeping,\r\n        Or linger to gaze on the years that are dead.\r\n\r\n      Fadeth my dream--and my day is declining,\r\n        But love lifts the gloamin' and smooths the rough way;\r\n      And I hail the bright midday o'er thee that is shining,\r\n        And think of a home that will ne'er pass away.\r\n\r\n[100] The name she was called by in her childhood.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1879 Lady Russell began again to have more intercourse with her\r\nfriends in London, and in May she went with her son and daughter to the\r\nAlexandra Hotel for a short stay in town. She writes in her Recollections:\r\n\r\n    In May (1879) we spent ten days at the Alexandra Hotel, in the\r\n    midst of many kind friends and acquaintances. It was strange to be\r\n    once more in \"the crowd, the hum, the shock of men\" as of old--and\r\n    all so changed, so solitary within.... We there first saw Mr.\r\n    Justin McCarthy--he has since become a true friend, and his\r\n    companionship and conversation are always delightful; as with so\r\n    warm a heart and so bright an intellect they could not fail to be.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1880, when Mr. Gladstone's candidature in Midlothian was causing\r\nthe greatest excitement and enthusiasm, Lady Russell received this letter\r\nfrom Mrs. Gladstone.\r\n\r\n    120, GEORGE STREET, EDINBURGH, _April_ 4, 1880\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR LADY RUSSELL,--We are so much touched by your letter and\r\n    all the warmth and kindness you have shown to ourselves and Mary\r\n    and Herbert. How can I thank you enough? I see in your letter all\r\n    the memories of the past, and that you can throw your kind heart\r\n    into the present moment lovingly. The old precious memories only\r\n    make you more alive to what is going on, as you think of _him_\r\n    who had gone before and shown so noble an example to my husband. No\r\n    doubt it did not escape you, words of my husband about Lord\r\n    Russell.... All here goes on splendidly; the enthusiasm continues\r\n    to increase, and all the returns have thrown us into a wild state\r\n    of ecstasy and thankfulness. It is, indeed, a blessing passing all\r\n    expectations, and I look back to all the time of anxiety beginning\r\n    with the Bulgarian horrors, all my husband's anxious hard work of\r\n    the past three or four years--how he was ridiculed and\r\n    insulted--and now, thank God, we are seeing the extraordinary\r\n    result of the elections, and listening to the goodness and\r\n    greatness of the policy so shamefully slandered; righteous\r\n    indignation has burst forth.... I loved to hear him saying aloud\r\n    some of the beautiful psalms of thanksgiving as his mind became\r\n    overwhelmed with gratitude and relieved with the great and good\r\n    news. Thank you again and again for your letter.\r\n\r\n    Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n    CATHERINE GLADSTONE\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Sir Mount Stuart Grant Duff [101] to Lady Russell_\r\n\r\n    _June_ 8, 1883\r\n\r\n    As to the public questions at home--alas! I can say nothing but\r\n    echo what you and some other wise people tell me. One is far too\r\n    much _out_ of the whole thing. I do not fear the Radical, I\r\n    greatly fear the Radical, or crotchet-monger.... Your phrase about\r\n    the division on the Affirmation Bill [102] rises to the dignity of\r\n    a _mot,_ and will be treasured by me as such. \"The triumph of\r\n    all that is worst in the name of all that is best.\"\r\n\r\n[101] At that time Governor of Madras.\r\n\r\n[102] In the April of 1881 Gladstone gave notice of an Affirmation\r\nBill, to enable men like Mr. Bradlaugh to become members of\r\nParliament without taking an oath which implied a belief in a\r\nSupreme Being. But it was not till 1883 that the Bill was taken up.\r\nOn April 26th Gladstone made one of his most lofty and fervid\r\nspeeches in support of the Bill, which, however, was lost by a\r\nmajority of three.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Agatha Russell_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _June,_ 1883\r\n\r\n    ... I have been regaling myself on Sydney Smith's Life and\r\n    Letters--the wisdom and the wit, the large-hearted and wide-minded\r\n    piety, the love of God and man set forth in word and deed, and the\r\n    unlikeness to anybody else, make it delightful companionship.... I\r\n    long to talk of things deep and high with you, but if I once began\r\n    I should go on and on, and \"of writing of letters there would be no\r\n    end.\" That is a grand passage of Hinton's [on music]. I always feel\r\n    that music means much more than just music, born of earth--joy and\r\n    sorrow, agony and rapture, are so mysteriously blended in its\r\n    glorious magic.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell's Recollections_\r\n\r\n    In July, 1883, I went with Agatha to see Dunrozel for the first\r\n    time ... I was simply enchanted--it was love at first sight, which\r\n    only deepened year after year.... We had a good many pleasant\r\n    neighbours; the Tennysons were more than pleasant, and welcomed us\r\n    with the utmost cordiality, and we loved them all.\r\n\r\n    At that time Professor Tyndall and Louisa [103] were almost the\r\n    only inhabitants of Hindhead. They were not yet in their house, but\r\n    till it was built and furnished lived in their \"hut,\" where they\r\n    used to receive us with the most cheering, as well as cheerful,\r\n    friendliness.\r\n\r\n[103] Mrs. Tyndall.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Miss Lilian Blyth_ [104] _[Mrs. Wilfred\r\n    Praeger]_\r\n\r\n    DUNROZEL, HASLEMERE, _November_ 16, 1883\r\n\r\n    Your letter is just like you, and that means all that is dear and\r\n    good and loving.... Indeed, past years are full of happy memories\r\n    of you all, not on marked days only, but on all days. At my age,\r\n    however, it is better to look forward to the renewal of all earthly\r\n    ties and all earth's best joys in an enduring home, than to look\r\n    back to the past--to the days before the blanks were left in the\r\n    earthly home which nothing here below can ever fill, and this it is\r\n    my prayer and my constant endeavour to do. We go home to dear\r\n    Pembroke Lodge next Tuesday ... going there must always be a\r\n    happiness to us all, yet this lovely little Dunrozel is not a place\r\n    to leave without many a pang.\r\n\r\n[104] Daughter of the Rev.

I find my head will not bear more than a certain amount of\r\n    writing without giddiness and dull headache ... and there are so\r\n    _many_ correspondents who must be answered; friends,\r\n    relations, business people, that I am often quite bewildered; ...\r\n    so, please, understand that I shall always write _when I can_,\r\n    but not nearly always when I _would like_ to do so. Go on\r\n    letting yourself out whether sadly or happily, or in mingled\r\n    sadness and happiness, and believe how very much I like to see into\r\n    your thoughts and your heart as much as letters can enable me to do\r\n    so.... As for Scotland, oh! Scotland, my own, my bonny Scotland! if\r\n    you associate that best and dearest of countries with your present\r\n    _ennui_ and unhappiness, I shall turn my back upon you for\r\n    good and all and give you up as a bad job! So make haste and tell\r\n    me that you entirely separate the two things, and if you don't\r\n    admire \"mine own romantic town\" and feel its beauty thrill through\r\n    and through you, you must find the cause in anything rather than in\r\n    Edinburgh itself! Such are my commands.... In the meantime let it\r\n    be a consolation and a support to you to remember that it is by\r\n    trials and difficulties that our characters are raised, developed,\r\n    strengthened, made more Christ-like.... Good-bye, good-bye. God\r\n    bless you.\r\n\r\n[105] Miss Bühler (who died some years ago) had been governess to\r\nLady Russell's grandson Bertrand. She was Swiss, and only nineteen\r\nwhen she came, and Lady Russell gave her motherly care and\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Sir Henry Taylor_\r\n\r\n    _February_ 29, 1884\r\n\r\n    I have just been reading with painful interest \"Mémoires d'un\r\n    Protestant condamné aux Galères\" in the days of that terribly\r\n    little great man Louis XIV. I ask myself at every page, \"Did man\r\n    really so treat his fellow-man? or is it all historical nightmare?\"\r\n    I never can make the slightest allowance for persecutors on the\r\n    ground that \"they thought it right to persecute.\" They had no\r\n    business so to think.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Gladstone to Lady Russell_\r\n\r\n    _December_ 14, 1884\r\n\r\n    I thank you for and return Dr. Westcott's interesting and weighty\r\n    letter.... A very clever man, a Bampton lecturer, evidently writing\r\n    with good and upright intention, sends me a lecture in which he\r\n    lays down the qualities he thinks necessary to make theological\r\n    study fruitful. They are courage, patience, and sympathy. He omits\r\n    one quality, in my opinion even more important than any of them,\r\n    and that is reverence. Without a great stock of reverence mankind,\r\n    as I believe, will go to the bad....\r\n\r\nDuring the strife and heat of the controversy on Home Rule, Lady Russell\r\nreceived the following letter from Mr. Gladstone:\r\n\r\n    10, DOWNING STREET, WHITEHALL,\r\n\r\n    _June_ 10, 1886\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR LADY RUSSELL,--I am not less gratified than touched by your\r\n    most acceptable note. It is most kind in you personally to give me\r\n    at a critical time the assurance of your sympathy and approval. And\r\n    I value it as a reflected indication of what would, I believe, have\r\n    been the course, had he been still among us, of one who was the\r\n    truest disciple of Mr. Fox, and was like him ever forward in the\r\n    cause of Ireland, a right handling of which he knew lay at the root\r\n    of all sound and truly Imperial policy. It was the more kind of you\r\n    to write at a time when domestic trial has been lying heavily upon\r\n    you. Believe me,\r\n\r\n    Very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n    W.E. GLADSTONE\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Agatha Russell_\r\n\r\n    DUNROZEL, HASLEMERE, _August_ 30, 1886\r\n\r\n    ... Our Sunday, mine especially, was a peaceful, lovely\r\n    Sabbath--mine especially because I didn't go to any church built\r\n    with hands, but held my silent, solitary worship in God's own\r\n    glorious temple, with no walls to limit my view, no lower roof than\r\n    the blue heavens over my head. The lawn, the green walk, the Sunday\r\n    bench in the triangle, each and all seemed filled with holiness and\r\n    prayer--sadness and sorrow. Visions of more than one beautiful past\r\n    which those spots have known and which never can return, were there\r\n    too; but the Eternal Love was around to hallow them....\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Miss Bühler_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _November_ 24, 1886\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST DORA,--I am afraid you will say that I have forgotten\r\n    you and your most loving and welcome birthday letter, but as I know\r\n    you will not _think_ it, I don't so very much mind. Nobody at\r\n    seventy-one and with many still to love and leave on earth, can\r\n    hail a birthday with much gladness.... The _real_ sadness to\r\n    me of birthdays, and of all marked days, is in the bitterly\r\n    disappointing answer I am obliged to make to myself to the\r\n    question: \"Am I nearer to God than a year ago?\" ... I never answered\r\n    your long-ago letter about your doubts and difficulties and\r\n    speculations on those subjects which are of deepest import to us\r\n    all, yet upon which it sometimes seems that we are doomed to work\r\n    our minds in vain--to seek, and _not_ to find--to exult one\r\n    moment in the fullness of bright hope and the coming fulfilment of\r\n    our highest aspirations, and the next to grope in darkness and say,\r\n    \"Was it not a beautiful dream, and only a dream? Is it not too good\r\n    to be true that we are the children of a loving Father who\r\n    stretches out His hands to guide us to Himself, who has spoken to\r\n    us in a thousand ways from the beginning of the world by His\r\n    wondrous works, by the unity of creation, by the voices of our\r\n    fellow-creatures, by that voice, most inspired of all, that life\r\n    and death most beautiful and glorious of all, which 'brought life\r\n    and immortality to light,' and chiefly by that which we feel to be\r\n    immortal within us--_love_--the beginning and end of God's own\r\n    nature, the supreme capability which He has breathed into our\r\n    souls?\" No, it is _not_ too good to be true. Nothing\r\n    perishes--not the smallest particle of the most worthless material\r\n    thing. Is immortality denied to the one thing most worthy of it?\r\n\r\n    I sent you \"The Utopian,\" because I thought some of the little\r\n    essays would fall in with all that filled your mind, and perhaps\r\n    help you to a spirit of hopefulness and confidence which\r\n    _will_ come to you and abide with you, I am sure. You will\r\n    soon receive another book written by several Unitarians, of which I\r\n    have only read very little as yet, but which seems to me full of\r\n    strength and comfort and holiness.... Good-bye, and God bless you.\r\n\r\n    Your ever affectionate,\r\n\r\n    F. RUSSELL\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Charlotte Portal to Lady Russell_\r\n\r\n    _January_ 26, 1887\r\n\r\n    DEAREST FANNY,--I wonder if you are quite easy in your conscience,\r\n    or whatever mechanism takes the place with you of that rococo old\r\n    article. Do you think you have behaved to me as an elder ought?--to\r\n    me, a poor young thing, looking for and sadly requiring the\r\n    guidance of my white-headed sister? Our last communications were at\r\n    Christmas-time--a month ago. Are you all well? Are you all entirely\r\n    at the feet of the dear baby boy? [106] Or have your republican\r\n    principles begun to rebel against his autocratic sway? ... I have\r\n    been amusing myself with an obscure author named William\r\n    Shakespeare, and enjoying him _immensely_. Amusing myself is\r\n    not the right expression, for I have been in the tragedies only. I\r\n    had not read \"Othello\" for ages. How wonderful, great, and\r\n    beautiful and painful it is (oh dear, why is it so coarse?). Then I\r\n    also read \"Lear\" and \"Henry VIII,\" and being delightfully ignorant\r\n    I had the great interest of reading the same period (Henry VIII) in\r\n    Holinshed, and in finding Katharine's and Wolsey's speeches there!\r\n    Then I have tried a little Ben Jonson and Lord Chesterfield's\r\n    letters. What a worldling, and what a destroyer of a young mind\r\n    that man was. Can you tell me how the son turned out? I cannot find\r\n    any information about him. The language is delightful, and I wish I\r\n    could remember any of his expressions.... Now give me a volume of\r\n    Pembroke Lodge news in return for this. Public matters, the fear of\r\n    war, the arming of all nations, make me sick at heart. How\r\n    wonderful and admirable the conduct of that poor friendless little\r\n    Bulgaria has been. Then Ireland, oh me! but on that topic I won't\r\n    write to the Home Ruler!\r\n\r\n    Your affectionate sister,\r\n\r\n    C.M.P.\r\n\r\n[106] Arthur, son of Mr. Rollo Russell.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Charlotte Portal_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _January_ 27, 1887\r\n\r\n    DEAREST LOTTY,--It was but yesterday that there rose dimly to my\r\n    memory the vision of a lady with the initials--C.M.P., and who\r\n    knows how long I might have remained in the dark as to who and what\r\n    she might be but for this letter, in which she claims me as a\r\n    sister! and moreover an elder and a wiser sister! one therefore\r\n    whose doings and not-doings, writing and not-writing, must not be\r\n    questioned by the younger....\r\n\r\n    We have imagined ourselves living in a state of isolation from our\r\n    fellow-creatures, but yours far exceeds ours and makes it almost\r\n    into a life of gaiety. I'm most extremely sorry to hear of it,\r\n    though most extremely glad to hear that your minds to you a kingdom\r\n    are. What good and wholesome and delightful food _your_ mind\r\n    has been living on. Isn't that Shakespeare too much of a marvel to\r\n    have really been a man? \"Othello\" is indeed all you say of it, and\r\n    more than anybody can say of it, and so are _all_ the great\r\n    plays. I am reading the historical ones with Bertie.... Alas,\r\n    indeed, for the coarseness! I never can understand the objections\r\n    to Bowdlerism. It seems to me so right and natural to prune away\r\n    what can do nobody good--what it pains eyes to look upon and ears\r\n    to hear--and to leave all the glories and beauties untouched....\r\n    The little Autocrat is beginning to master some of the maxims of\r\n    Constitutional Monarchy--for instance, to find out that we do not\r\n    always leave the room the moment he waves his hand by way of\r\n    dismissal and utters the command of \"Tata.\" I waste too much time\r\n    upon him, in spite of daily resolutions to neglect him.... I don't\r\n    at all know whether Lord Chesterfield succeeded in making his son\r\n    like his own clever, worldly, contemptible self, but will try to\r\n    find out. _Have_ you read \"Dean Maitland\"? [107] Now, Fanny,\r\n    do stop, you know you have many other letters to write....\r\n\r\n    Ever thine,\r\n\r\n    F.R.\r\n\r\n[107] \"The Silence of Dean Maitland,\" by Maxwell Grey.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Georgiana Peel_\r\n\r\n    DUNROZEL, HASLEMERE, SURREY, _September_ 9 [1887]\r\n\r\n    ... Your account of the Queen and her visit interested us much....\r\n    I often wish she could ever know all my gratitude to her and the\r\n    nation for the unspeakable blessing and happiness Pembroke Lodge\r\n    has been, and is; joys and sorrows, hopes fulfilled, and hopes\r\n    faded and crushed, chances and changes, and memories unnumbered,\r\n    are sacredly bound up with that dear home. Will it ever be loved by\r\n    others as we have loved it? It seems impossible....\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Charlotte Portal_\r\n\r\n    DUNROZEL, HASLEMERE, _September_ 12, 1887\r\n\r\n    DEAREST LOTTY,--I don't think I am writing because your clock is on\r\n    the stroke of Sixty-three, for these clocks of ours become\r\n    obtrusive, and the less they are listened to the better for our\r\n    spirits. I wonder whether it's wrong and unnatural not to rejoice\r\n    in their rapid movements as regards myself. I often think so. There\r\n    is so much, or rather there are so many, oh, so many! to go to when\r\n    it has struck for the last time, and the longing and the yearning\r\n    to be with them is so unspeakable--and yet, dear Lotty, I cling to\r\n    those here, not less and less, but more and more, as the time for\r\n    leaving them draws nearer. God grant you many and many another\r\n    birthday of happiness, as I trust this one is to you and your\r\n    home.... Your letter was an echo of much that we had been saying to\r\n    one another, as we read our novel--not only does nobody, man or\r\n    even woman, see every change and know its meaning in the human\r\n    countenance, and interpret rightly the slight flush, the hidden\r\n    tremor, the shade of pallor, the faint tinge, etc.; but we don't\r\n    think there _are_ perceptible changes to such an extent except\r\n    in novels.... I think a great evil of novels for girls, mingled\r\n    with great good, is the false expectation they raise that\r\n    _somebody_ will know and understand their every thought, look,\r\n    emotion.... How glad I am that you have a rival baby to\r\n    worship--ours is beyond all praise--oh, so comical and so lovely in\r\n    all his little ways and words....\r\n\r\n    Your most affectionate sister,\r\n\r\n    F.R.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Georgiana Peel_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _November_ 28, 1887\r\n\r\n    ... We have been having such a delightful visit from Lotty ... we\r\n    _did_ talk; and yet it seems as if all the talk had only made\r\n    me wish for a great deal more. Books and babies and dress and\r\n    almsgiving and amusements and the nineteenth century, its merits\r\n    and its faults, high things and low things, and big things and\r\n    trifles, and sense and nonsense, and everything except Home Rule,\r\n    on which we don't agree and couldn't spare time to fight. We did\r\n    thoroughly agree, however, as I think people of all parties must\r\n    have done, in admiration of a lecture, or rather speech, made at\r\n    our school by a very good and clever Mr. Wicksteed, a Nonconformist\r\n    (I believe Unitarian) minister on Politics and Morals. The\r\n    principle on which he founded it was that politics are a branch of\r\n    morals; accordingly he placed them on as high a level as any other\r\n    duty of life, and spoke with withering indignation of the too\r\n    common practice, and even theory, that a little insincerity, a\r\n    little trickery, is allowable in politics, whereas it would not be\r\n    in other matters. [108] We were all delighted.\r\n\r\n[108] Lady Russell often quoted a saying attributed to Fox,\r\n\"Nothing which is morally wrong can ever be politically right.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Charlotte Portal_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _March_ 7, 1888\r\n\r\n    \"Adam Bede\" was as interesting a sofa companion as you could have\r\n    found; a very lovely book--wit and pathos almost equally good,\r\n    pathos quite the best though, to my mind. We are reading aloud\r\n    another charming book of Lowell's, \"Democracy,\" and other essays in\r\n    the same volume; and I flutter about from book to book by myself,\r\n    and have still two books of \"Paradise Lost\" to read, and am\r\n    wondering what is going to happen to Adam and Eve. I was very\r\n    miserable when I found she ate the forbidden fruit. She had made\r\n    such fair promises to be good. Alas, alas! why did she break them?\r\n    That story of the Fall, though I suppose nobody thinks it verbally\r\n    true, is always to me most full of deep meaning, and seems to be\r\n    the story of every mortal man and woman born into this wondrous\r\n    world.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Charlotte Portal_\r\n\r\n    DUNROZEL, HASLEMERE, _October_ 3, 1888\r\n\r\n    Agatha gone yesterday to Pembroke Lodge--Rollo gone to-day to join\r\n    her, so my wee bairnie and I are \"left by our lone,\" as you used to\r\n    say. \"Einsam nein, dass bin ich nicht, denn die Geister meiner\r\n    Lieben, Sie umschweben mich.\" [109] I think it's good now and then\r\n    to let the blessed and beautiful memories of the past have their\r\n    way and float in waking dreams before our eyes, and not be forced\r\n    down beneath daily duties and occupations and enjoyments, till the\r\n    pain of keeping them there becomes hard to bear. Yet, \"act, act in\r\n    the living present\" is very, very much the rightest thing; though I\r\n    don't think I quite like the past to be called the _dead_\r\n    past, when it is so fearfully full of keenest life.\r\n\r\n[109] \"Lonely--no, that am I not, for the spirits of my loved ones,\r\nthey hover around me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Georgiana Peel_\r\n\r\n    DUNROZEL, HASLEMERE, SURREY, _October_ 8, 1888\r\n\r\n    ... We have had Rollo's old Oxford friend, Dr. Drewitt, here for\r\n    two nights--the very cheerfulest of guests. He is head of the\r\n    Victoria Hospital for Children, and what with keen interest in his\r\n    profession, and intense love of nature, animate and inanimate, I\r\n    don't think he would know how to be bored. Hard-worked men have far\r\n    the best of it here below, although we are accustomed to look upon\r\n    \"men of leisure\" as those to be envied; but how seldom one finds a\r\n    man or woman, who lives a life in earnest, and who has eyes to see\r\n    and observe, taking a gloomy view of human nature and its\r\n    destinies. I wonder what you have been reading? I have taken up\r\n    lately that delightful book, Lockhart's \"Life of Sir Walter Scott,\"\r\n    and dipping into many besides.... Some of our pleasantest\r\n    neighbours have paid us good-bye visits; Frederic Harrisons, and\r\n    the charming and wonderful old Miss Swanwick [110]....\r\n\r\n[110] Miss Anna Swanwick.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Charlotte Portal_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _March_ 13, 1889\r\n\r\n    How could you, could you, could you think that my mental vow not to\r\n    write on the all-absorbing political catastrophe was because I sing\r\n    \"God save, Ireland\" in one sense, and you in another! The vow was\r\n    made because if once the flood-gates of my eloquence are let loose\r\n    on that subject, there is a danger that the stream will\r\n    Tennysonially \"go on for ever.\" It is, however, a vow made to be\r\n    broken from time to time, when I allow a little ripple to flow a\r\n    little way and make a little noise, and then return to the usual\r\n    attitude towards non-sympathizers; and, like David, keep silence\r\n    and refrain even from good words, though it is pain and grief to\r\n    me, and my heart is hot within me. I am speaking of the mere\r\n    acquaintance non-sympathizers, or those known to be too bitter to\r\n    bear difference of opinion; but don't be afraid, or do be afraid,\r\n    as you may put it, and be prepared for total removal of the\r\n    flood-gates when _you_ come. Don't you often feel yourself in\r\n    David's trying condition, knowing that your words would be very\r\n    good, yet had better not be spoken? I don't like it at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Charlotte Portal_\r\n\r\n    DUNROZEL, _September_ 4, 1889\r\n\r\n    DEAREST LOTTY,--It was nice to hear from you from Minto. What a\r\n    strange sensation it always gives me to write or to hear that word\r\n    of _Minto._ [111] I am sure you know it too--impossible to\r\n    define, but like something beautiful and holy, not belonging to\r\n    this world. I like to hope that such memories have been stored up\r\n    by the younger spirits who have succeeded us, while \"children not\r\n    hers have trod our nursery floor.\" But in this restless, fly-about\r\n    age can they ever be quite the same? ... I see that luckily I have\r\n    no room to go on about lovely, lovable, sorrowful Ireland. Alas!\r\n    that England has ever had anything to do with her; but better times\r\n    are coming, and she will be understood by her conquerors at last,\r\n    and be the better for them. Hush! Fanny, no more; even that is too\r\n    much. God bless thee.\r\n\r\n    Ever thine,\r\n\r\n    F.R.\r\n\r\n[111] Lady Russell had written in 1857 to her father about Minto: \"I can\r\nwell imagine the loveliness of that loveliest and dearest of places. There\r\nis now to us all a holy beauty in every tree and flower, in rock and river\r\nand hill that ought to do us good.\" Later, in a letter to her sister, Lady\r\nElizabeth Romilly, she writes of \"the Minto of old days, that happiest and\r\nmost perfect home that children ever had.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1889 the \"Life of Lord John Russell\" by Mr. Spencer Walpole, was\r\npublished.\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Gladstone to Lady Russell_\r\n\r\n    HAWARDEN CASTLE, CHESTER, _October_ 30, 1889\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR LADY RUSSELL,--The week which has elapsed since I received\r\n    from Mr. Walpole's kindness a copy of his biography has been with\r\n    me a busy one; but I have now completed a careful perusal of the\r\n    first volume. I cannot help writing to congratulate you on its\r\n    appearance. It presents a beautiful and a noble picture. Having so\r\n    long admired and loved your husband (and the political characters\r\n    which attract love are not very numerous), I now, with the fuller\r\n    knowledge of an early period which this volume gives me, both\r\n    admire and love him more. Your own personal share in the\r\n    delineation is enviable. And the biographer more than vindicates\r\n    the wisdom of your choice; his work is capital, but it could not\r\n    have been achieved except with material of the first order. O for\r\n    his aid in the present struggle, which, however, is proceeding to\r\n    _our_ heart's content. Believe me always most sincerely yours,\r\n    W.E. GLADSTONE\r\n\r\nA little later Mr. Gladstone sent Lady Russell a proof copy of an article\r\nby him on the Melbourne Ministry, [112] from which the following passages\r\nare here quoted:\r\n\r\n    ... He [Lord John Russell] brought into public life, and he carried\r\n    through it unimpaired, the qualities which ennoble manhood--truth,\r\n    justice, fortitude, self-denial, a fund of genuine indignation\r\n    against wrong, and an inexhaustible sympathy with human\r\n    suffering.... With a slender store of physical power, his life was\r\n    a daily assertion of the superiority of the spirit to the flesh.\r\n    With the warmest domestic affections, and the keen susceptibilities\r\n    of sufferings they entail, he never failed to rally under sorrow to\r\n    the call of public duty. There were no bounds to the prowess or the\r\n    fellow-feeling with which he would fling himself into the breach on\r\n    behalf of a belaboured colleague; ... in 1852 an attack upon Lord\r\n    Clarendon's conduct as Viceroy of Ireland stirred all the depths of\r\n    his nature, and he replied in a series of the noblest fighting\r\n    passages which I have ever heard spoken in Parliament ... At the\r\n    head of all these qualities stands the moral element. I do not\r\n    recollect or know the time in our own history when the two great\r\n    parties in the House of Commons have been led by men who so truly\r\n    and so largely as Lord John Russell and Sir Robert Peel identified\r\n    political with personal morality. W.E. GLADSTONE\r\n\r\n[112] _Nineteenth Century_, January, 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Charlotte Portal to Lady Russell, after reading Mr.\r\n    Walpole's \"Life of Lord John Russell\" December 26, 1889_\r\n\r\n    ... I long that every one should know as we do what the\r\n    extraordinary beauty of that daily life was. I always think it was\r\n    the most perfect man's life that I ever knew of; and that could\r\n    better bear the full flood of light than any other.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1890, after nearly twelve years' break in her diary, Lady\r\nRussell began writing again a few words of daily record. On the 6th she\r\nmentions a \"most agreeable\" visit from Mr. Froude; the same day she\r\nreceived Mr. Justin McCarthy to dinner, and adds that the talk was \"more\r\nShakespeare than Ireland.\"\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Mr. Justin McCarthy_ [113]\r\n\r\n    _November_ 19, 1890\r\n\r\n    DEAR MR. MCCARTHY,--I hardly know why I write to you, but this\r\n    terrible sin and terrible verdict make us very, very unhappy, and\r\n    we think constantly of you, who have been among his closest\r\n    friends, and of all who have trusted him and refused to believe in\r\n    the charge against him. You must, I know, be feeling all the\r\n    keenness and bitterness of sorrow in the moral downfall of a man\r\n    whose claims to the gratitude and admiration of his country in his\r\n    public career nothing can cancel. It is also much to be feared that\r\n    the great cause will suffer, at least in England, if he retains the\r\n    leadership. It ought not, of course; but where enthusiasm and even\r\n    respect for the leader can no longer be felt, there is danger of\r\n    diminution of zeal for the cause. Were he to take the honourable\r\n    course, which alone would show a sense of shame--that of\r\n    resignation--his political enemies would be silenced, and his\r\n    friends would feel that although reparation for the past is\r\n    impossible, he has not been blinded by long continuance in\r\n    deception and sin to his own unworthiness, and to the fact that his\r\n    word can no longer be trusted as it has been, and as that of a\r\n    leader ought to be. I dare not think of what his own state of mind\r\n    must be; it makes me so miserable--the unlimited trust of a nation\r\n    not only in his political but in his moral worth must be like a\r\n    dagger in his heart. Were he to retire, the recollection of the\r\n    great qualities he has shown would revive, and the proof of remorse\r\n    given by his retirement would draw a veil over his guilt, and the\r\n    charity, which we all need, would not be withheld from him. I know\r\n    that numerous instances can be given of men in the highest\r\n    positions who have retained them without opposition in spite of\r\n    lives tainted with similar sin; but this has not been without evil\r\n    to the nation, and I think there is a stronger sense now than there\r\n    used to be of the value of high private character in public men, in\r\n    spite of a great deal of remaining Pharisaism in the difference of\r\n    the measure of condemnation meted out to different men. I think too\r\n    that the unusual and most painful amount of low deception in this\r\n    case will be felt, even more than the sin itself, by the English\r\n    people. Pray forgive me, dear Mr. McCarthy, for writing on this sad\r\n    topic; but I have got into the habit of writing and speaking freely\r\n    to you, even when it can, as now, do no earthly good to anybody.\r\n\r\n    There is one consolation in the thought that should he retire\r\n    Ireland is not wanting in the best and highest to succeed him. Pray\r\n    do not write if you prefer not, though I long to hear from you, or\r\n    still better see you.\r\n\r\n    Yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\n    F. RUSSELL\r\n\r\n[113] Written after the Parnell O'Shea divorce case.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Mr. Justin McCarthy_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _November_ 22, 1890\r\n\r\n    DEAR MR. MCCARTHY,--I cannot rest without telling you how very\r\n    sorry I shall be if my letter gave you one moment's pain. I knew\r\n    how close and true a friend you were of Mr. Parnell, and how\r\n    unchanging your friendship would be; but I did not know which\r\n    course that unchanging friendship would lead you to take. Not a\r\n    doubt can ever cross our minds of the patriotism which has dictated\r\n    your action and that of your Irish colleagues. Do not allow any\r\n    doubt to cross yours or theirs, that it is the intensity of love\r\n    for the great cause which led many in England to wish for a\r\n    different decision. Nothing would be more terrible, more fatal,\r\n    than any coldness between the friends of Ireland on the two sides\r\n    of the Channel. May God avert such a misfortune, and whatever\r\n    happens, believe me always most sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n    F. RUSSELL\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Justin McCarthy to Lady Russell_\r\n\r\n    _November_ 24, 1890\r\n\r\n    DEAR LADY RUSSELL,--I ought to have answered your kind letter\r\n    before, for I value your sympathy more--much more--than I can tell\r\n    you in words. I am afraid the prospect is dark for the present. Mr.\r\n    Gladstone sent for me to-day and I had some talk with him. He was\r\n    full of generous consideration and kindness, but he thinks there\r\n    will be a catastrophe for the cause if Parnell does not retire. The\r\n    Irish members _cannot_ and _would not_ throw over\r\n    Parnell, but he may even yet decide upon retiring. All depends on\r\n    to-morrow, and we have not seen him. I have the utmost faith in his\r\n    singleness of public purpose and his judgment and policy, but it is\r\n    a terrible crisis.\r\n\r\n    With kindest regards, very truly yours,\r\n\r\n    JUSTIN MCCARTHY\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Mrs. Warburton_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _November_ 23, 1890\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST ISABEL,--... Yes, dearie, it _was_ a delightful\r\n    visit, leaving delightful memories of all kinds; chats gay and\r\n    grave trots long and short, drives, duets--will they ever come\r\n    again? I am very glad this heart-breaking Irish thunderclap did not\r\n    fall while you were here. It makes us so unhappy. Poor Ireland! her\r\n    hopes are always dashed when about to be fulfilled. Nothing can\r\n    palliate the fearful sin and almost more fearful course of\r\n    miserable deception; but he might, by taking the one right and\r\n    honourable course of resigning his leadership--if only for a\r\n    time--at least have given a proof of shame, and have saved England\r\n    and Ireland from the terrible pain of discussion and disagreement,\r\n    and from the danger to Home Rule which his retention of the post\r\n    must cause. His Parliamentary colleagues have done immense harm by\r\n    their loud protestations in his favour. There is much to excuse\r\n    them, but not him, for this course. Our poor Davitt is miserable,\r\n    and is braving a storm of unpopularity by writing strongly against\r\n    his (Parnell's) retention of the leadership. His whole thought is\r\n    for Ireland, and he knows that his advice is that of a true friend\r\n    to her--as well as to the wretched man himself....\r\n\r\n    Your ever affectionate,\r\n\r\n    MAMA\r\n\r\nMr. Michael Davitt had taken a house in Richmond, and was living there at\r\nthis time. Some years earlier Lady Russell had read his \"Prison Diary,\" and\r\nhad written the following poem. She did not know him at that time.\r\n\r\n_Written after reading Michael Davitt's \"Leaves from a Prison Diary\"_\r\n\r\n  DUNROZEL, _September,_ 1887\r\n\r\n  Man's justice is not Thine, O God, his scales\r\n  Uneven hang, while he with padlocked heart\r\n  Some glittering shred of human tinsel sees\r\n  Outweigh the pure bright gold of noblest souls,\r\n  Who from the mists of earth their eyes uplift\r\n  And seek to read Thy message in the stars.\r\n\r\n  Thou hearest, Lord, beneath the felon's garb\r\n  The lonely throbbing of no felon's heart,\r\n  The cry of agony--the prayer of love\r\n  By agony unconquered--love, heaven-born,\r\n  That fills with holy light the joyless cell,\r\n  As with the daybreak of his prayer fulfilled,\r\n  The glorious dawn of brotherhood for man,\r\n  And freedom to the sorrowing land that bore him,\r\n  For whose dear sake he smiles upon his chains.\r\n  Thou gatherest, Lord, his bitter nightly tears\r\n  For home, for face beloved and trusted hand,\r\n  For the green earth, the freshly blowing breeze,\r\n  The heaven of Liberty, all, all shut out.\r\n\r\n  His vanished dreams, his withered hopes Thou knowest,\r\n  The baffled yearnings of his heart to snatch\r\n  From paths unhallowed childhood's tottering feet,\r\n  And lay a rosy smile on little lips\r\n  With homeless hunger pale, to curses trained,\r\n  Whereon no kiss hath left a memory sweet.\r\n\r\n  His chainless spirit, bruised by prison bars,\r\n  Wounded by touch of fellow-men in whom\r\n  Thy image lost he vainly sought, Thou seest\r\n  Unsullied still, lord of its own domain,\r\n  Soar in its own blue sky of faith and hope.\r\n\r\n  Such have there been and such there yet will be,\r\n  From whom the world's hard eye is turned in scorn,\r\n  But still for each a nation's tears will fall,\r\n  A nation's heart will be his earthly haven,\r\n  And when no earthly stay he needeth more,\r\n  Will he not, Father, feel Thy love enfold him,\r\n  And hear Thy voice, \"Servant of God, well done.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Charlotte Portal_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _November 26, 1890_\r\n\r\n    Alas! alas! the last fortnight has indeed been one of darkness and\r\n    sorrow over the country; railway and ocean horrors breaking many\r\n    hundreds of hearts, disgrace to England in Africa, disgrace to a\r\n    trusted leader dashing down the hopes of Ireland and bringing back\r\n    disunion between the two nations. We made ourselves miserable over\r\n    last night's news of the determination of his parliamentary\r\n    followers to stand by him, and his acceptance of their re-election.\r\n    Poor old Gladstone! I am sure you must admire his letter to Mr.\r\n    Morley. To-day we are told to have a little hope that it may have\r\n    influence in the right direction, but we hardly feel any. We\r\n    heartily agree with every word you say on this most painful matter.\r\n    The one consolation is to see such an increase of opinion that a\r\n    leader must be a man of high private, as well as public, character.\r\n    How often I have deplored the absence of any such opinion!\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Mr. Justin McCarthy_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _November 27, 1890_\r\n\r\n    DEAR MR. MCCARTHY,--Your most kind letter was a relief to me as\r\n    regarded the spirit in which you had taken what I wrote, but also\r\n    made us very, very sad, and nothing that we have heard or read in\r\n    newspapers since has given more than a mere ray of hope. And why\r\n    should this be? Surely the path of honour and duty is plain. It\r\n    cannot be taken without pain; but such moments as this are the test\r\n    of greatness in men and nations. Gratitude untold is due to Mr.\r\n    Parnell. Those who have been his friends will not withdraw their\r\n    friendship; but surely that very friendship ought to resolve that\r\n    the vast good he has done in the past should not be undone for the\r\n    future, to his own eternal discredit, by encouragement to him to\r\n    retain the leadership. Surely the claims of your country stand\r\n    first; and is not the impending breach between English and Irish\r\n    Home Rulers a misfortune to both countries, too terrible to be\r\n    calmly faced? Already there is a tone in the Freeman's Journal\r\n    which I could not have believed would be adopted towards men like\r\n    Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Morley, who have identified themselves heart\r\n    and soul with Ireland. Of course, they are far above being turned\r\n    for a moment from their course by any such comments, but it must be\r\n    a pain to them nevertheless. It almost seems aberration of mind in\r\n    Mr. Parnell to be deaf to Mr. Gladstone's words of true patriotism,\r\n    echoed as they are throughout England and Scotland, and I cannot\r\n    but believe in thousands of Irish hearts besides. Surely this must\r\n    have gone far to convince his friends that they would be more than\r\n    justified in convincing him that retirement for awhile is his duty,\r\n    or, if they cannot convince him, in acting upon their own\r\n    convictions, if these are such as I hope. Indignation against the\r\n    terrible revelations of his guilt has driven some English\r\n    newspapers into language deeply to be deplored; but on the whole\r\n    the feeling, as shown in speeches and in the Press, has been\r\n    healthy and just. Sir Charles Russell's words struck us as among\r\n    the very best. It is the deepest and highest love for Ireland that\r\n    makes men speak and write as they do.\r\n\r\n    Dear Mr. McCarthy, I think you can do much, and I know how firm, as\r\n    well as how gentle, it is your nature to be. Save us all, for God's\r\n    sake, from the dreaded disunion and the ruin of the cause. Do not\r\n    let England and Ireland be again looked upon as separated in their\r\n    hopes, interests, aspirations. May Mr. Dillon and Mr. O'Brien help\r\n    to the good work; but too much can hardly depend on men at a\r\n    distance, excellent and patriotic as they are.\r\n\r\n    Good-bye, dear Mr. McCarthy. May God guide and unite our two\r\n    countries on the road of justice and truth and happiness. Pray,\r\n    pray forgive me once more for writing.\r\n\r\n    Ever most sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n    F. RUSSELL\r\n\r\nIn 1891 Mr. Rollo Russell married Miss Gertrude Joachim, niece of the great\r\nviolinist, Dr. Joachim, and Lady Russell found new joy in his happiness.\r\n\r\n    _Queen Victoria to Lady Russell_\r\n\r\n    _January_ 1, 1891\r\n\r\n    DEAR LADY RUSSELL,--You are indeed right in thinking that I should\r\n    always take an interest in anything that concerned you and your\r\n    family, and I rejoice to hear that your son is going to make a\r\n    marriage which gives you pleasure, and trust it may conduce to your\r\n    comfort as well as to his happiness. It is a long time since I have\r\n    had the pleasure of seeing you, dear Lady Russell, and I trust that\r\n    some day this may be possible. Past days can never be\r\n    forgotten--indeed, one loves to dwell on them, though the thought\r\n    is mingled with sadness. Pray remember me to Agatha, and believe me\r\n    always,\r\n\r\n    Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n    V.R.I.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Mr. Rollo Russell_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _January_ 14, 1892\r\n\r\n    ... Most truly do you say that, while we can shelter ourselves from\r\n    the demands that assail our physical being, no defence has been\r\n    found against the bitter blasts which batter against our mental and\r\n    spiritual structure--no _defence_, only endurance, in hope and\r\n    faith and endeavour after Marcus Aurelius's \"Equanimitas,\" and the\r\n    knowledge that the higher man's mental and moral capacity the\r\n    greater is his capacity for suffering.... And nobody has shown more\r\n    than you do in \"Psalms of the West\" that sorrow is not\r\n    _all_ sorrow, but has a heavenly sacredness that gives\r\n    strength to bear its burden \"in quietness and confidence\" to the\r\n    end. How entirely I feel with you that this has been a glorious\r\n    century. Not all the evil and the misery and the vice and the\r\n    meanness and pettinesses which abound on every side, as we look\r\n    around, can blind me to the blessed truth that the eyes of mankind\r\n    have been opening to see and to deplore these things, and to give\r\n    their lives to the study of their causes, and the discovery and\r\n    practice of means to put an end to them. The wonderful intellectual\r\n    strides, which my long life enables me not only to be aware of, but\r\n    to remember as they have one by one been made, are in close\r\n    connection with this moral and religious development; and all these\r\n    together will, I believe, raise the education of the people\r\n    (already so far above the standard of fifty, much more of a hundred\r\n    years ago) to something of the kind to which you look\r\n    forward--\"more high, more wide, more various, more poetic, more\r\n    inspiring, more full of principles and less full of facts \"--a\r\n    consummation devoutly to be wished.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _June_ 22, 1892\r\n\r\n    Day of much weakness. The sense of failing increases rapidly. May\r\n    the short time that remains to me make me less unfit to meet my\r\n    God. Oh, that I could begin life again! How different it would be\r\n    from what has been. I have had everything to help me upward; joys\r\n    and sorrows, encouragement and disappointment, the love and example\r\n    of my dearest husband and children in our daily companionship and\r\n    communion, the never-failing and precious affection and help of\r\n    brothers, sisters, and friends--and yet my life seems all a failure\r\n    when I think what it might have been.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Charlotte Portal_\r\n\r\n    THE GRANGE, HINDHEAD, HASLEMERE, _July_ 20, 1892\r\n\r\n    Yes, elections are hard tests of character, and there are too, too\r\n    many excellent people on both sides who are led on to say hard,\r\n    unjust, untrue things of their opponents.... But there _is_\r\n    another side to elections--a grand and noble one--which makes me\r\n    feel to my inmost soul the greatness and the blessed freedom of\r\n    this dear old country, and always brings to my mind what John used\r\n    to say with something of a boy's enthusiasm, \"I _love_ a\r\n    contested election.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE GRANGE, HINDHEAD, _October_ 6, 1892\r\n\r\n    Tennyson died about one o'clock a.m. A great and good light\r\n    extinguished.\r\n\r\n    _October 7th_\r\n\r\n    Agatha and I early to Aldworth.

But in this case I rejoice to\r\n    have seen on that noble face the perfect peace which of late years\r\n    was wanting--it was really \"the rapture of repose.\" A volume of\r\n    Shakespeare which he had asked for, and the leaves of which he had\r\n    turned over yesterday, I believe to find \"Cymbeline,\" at which\r\n    place it was open, lay on the bed.

It is true that these things are of eternal moment, and\r\n    therefore links between earth and heaven. Yet it often seems to me\r\n    foolish to care about them very much when the solution of all\r\n    enigmas is so near at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Mrs. Rollo Russell_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _March_ 17, 1893\r\n\r\n    ... The chief Pembroke Lodge event since I wrote is that I went on\r\n    Monday to Windsor Castle to luncheon; after which morning meal with\r\n    the household, almost all strangers to me, I saw the Queen alone\r\n    and had a good long and most easy and pleasant conversation with\r\n    her. She was as cordial as possible, and I am _very_ glad to\r\n    have seen her again; although there was much sadness mingled with\r\n    the gladness in a meeting after a period of many, many years, which\r\n    had brought their full number of changes to me--and some to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Mr. Rollo Russell_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, RICHMOND, SURREY, _July_ 7, 1893\r\n\r\n    I feel intensely all you say about laying aside, if it were\r\n    possible, one's own personality and seeing the silent growth of all\r\n    truth and goodness, without the disturbance of names and parties;\r\n    but the world being as it is for the present, we can only keep our\r\n    minds fixed on the good and the true, with whomsoever and with\r\n    whatsoever party we may find it, and follow it with honest\r\n    conviction. If I could, I would put an end to Party Government\r\n    to-morrow, and my great wish for M.P.'s is that each one should,\r\n    upon each subject, vote exactly according to his opinion, and no\r\n    Ministry be turned out except upon a vote of want of confidence. I\r\n    honour and love Mr. Gladstone, and while ardently sympathetic with\r\n    him on Home Rule and all other Liberal measures, I am no less\r\n    antipathetic on Church matters. Happily, however, they have become\r\n    with him matters chiefly of personal attachment to Anglicanism, and\r\n    no longer (I believe) likely to affect his legislation.\r\n    \"Gladstonian\" is a word he does not admit, nor do those of whom it\r\n    is used.\r\n\r\n    _July_ 9, 1893.--Well, to go on with our politics: \"a new\r\n    policy\" Home Rule undoubtedly is, a new departure from the\r\n    \"tradition\" of any English party; but _not_ a departure from\r\n    Liberal principles, only a new application of old ones, and I think\r\n    it is a pity to speak of it as being against Liberal principles,\r\n    for is there anybody of average intelligence who would not have\r\n    predicted that if it should ever be adopted by any party it would\r\n    be by the Liberals? Exactly the same thing was said about Turkey:\r\n    the Whig tradition was to support her, Liberals were forsaking\r\n    their principles by taking part with Bulgaria against her. It is\r\n    the proud distinction of Liberals to _grow_ perpetually, and\r\n    to march on with eyes open, and to discover, as they are pretty\r\n    sure to do, that they have not always in the past been true to\r\n    their principles. There is no case exactly parallel with that of\r\n    Ireland; but there are some in great measure analogous, and it is\r\n    the Liberals who have listened to the voice of other countries,\r\n    some of them our own dependencies, in their national aspirations or\r\n    their desire for Parliaments of their own, expressed by\r\n    Constitutional majorities. I admire the Unionists for standing by\r\n    their own convictions with regard to Home Rule, and always have\r\n    done so; but I cannot call it \"devotion to the Union _and to_\r\n    Liberal principles,\" and I am not aware of there being a single\r\n    Home Ruler not a Liberal. The Unionists, especially those in\r\n    Parliament, have been, and are, in a very dangerous position, and\r\n    have yielded too readily to the temptation of a sudden transference\r\n    of party loyalty upon almost every question from Liberal to Tory\r\n    leaders. But for those, whether in or out of Parliament, who have\r\n    remained Liberals--and I know several such--I don't see why, after\r\n    Home Rule is carried, they should not be once more merged in the\r\n    great body of Liberals, and have their chances, like others, of\r\n    being chosen to serve their country in Parliament and in office....\r\n\r\n    I am reading a book by Grant Allen, \"Science in Arcady.\" ... He\r\n    brings wit and originality into these essays on plants, lakes,\r\n    spiders, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Agatha Russell_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _September_ 22, 1893\r\n\r\n    ... With regard to the modern attraction of ugly subjects\r\n    (_not_ when the wish to remedy gross evils makes it a duty to\r\n    study and live among them; but as common talk between young men and\r\n    young women), I feel very strongly that the contemplation of God,\r\n    and all that is God-like in the souls that He has created, is our\r\n    best safeguard against evil, and that the contemplation of the\r\n    spirit of evil, and all the hideous variety of its works, gradually\r\n    taints us and weakens our powers of resistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Agatha Russell_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _October_ 21, 1893\r\n\r\n    ... I entirely agree with you, that poetry and music \"teach us of\r\n    the things that are unseen\" as nothing else can do. Music\r\n    especially, which is an unseen thing, not the product of man at\r\n    all, but found from man as a gift from God's own hand. I don't know\r\n    what at some periods of my life I should have done without these\r\n    blessed sympathizers and outlets and uplifting friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Mrs. Drummond_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _December_ 16, 1893\r\n\r\n    Your long interesting letter is most welcome. You are very good and\r\n    brave to do so much for the good of others, while suffering\r\n    yourself. How much harder it is to _bear_ patiently, and keep\r\n    up sympathy and fellow-feeling within us in spite of illness, than\r\n    to do any amount of active work while in health. I always find my\r\n    highest examples in those who know how to \"suffer and be strong,\"\r\n    because it is my own greatest difficulty.\r\n\r\n    Oh, my dear child, what opinions _can_ poor I give on the\r\n    almost insoluble problems you put before me? I wish I knew of any\r\n    book or any man or woman who could tell me whether a Poor Law, even\r\n    the very best, is on the whole a blessing or a curse, and how the\r\n    \"unemployed\" can be chosen out for work of any useful or productive\r\n    kind without injury to others equally deserving, and what are the\r\n    just limits of State interference with personal liberty. The House\r\n    of Lords puzzles me less. I would simply declare it, by Act of the\r\n    House of Commons, injurious to the best interests of the nation and\r\n    for ever dissolved. Then it may either show its attachment to the\r\n    Constitution by giving its assent to its own annihilation, or\r\n    oblige us to break through the worn-out Constitution and declare\r\n    their assent unnecessary. It is beyond all bearing that one great\r\n    measure after another should be delayed, or mutilated, year after\r\n    year, by such a body, and I chafe and fret inwardly to a painful\r\n    degree. Oh for a long talk with you! I will not despair of going to\r\n    you, \"gin I be spared\" till the days are reasonably long.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lady Russell to Lady Agatha Russell_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _October_ 10, 1894\r\n\r\n    ... Alas! for our dear Oliver Wendell Holmes! He has left the world\r\n    much the poorer by his death, but much the richer by his life and\r\n    works.... Lord Grey gone too, and with him what recollections of my\r\n    young days, before and after marriage, when he and Lady Grey and we\r\n    were very much together. We loved them both. He was a very trying\r\n    political colleague to your father and others, but a very faithful\r\n    friend. The longer I live the more firmly I am convinced that in\r\n    most cases to know people well is to like them--to forget their\r\n    faults in their merits. But no doubt it is delightful to have no\r\n    faults to forget.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _March_ 3, 1894\r\n\r\n    Touching accounts of meeting of the Cabinet--the last with dear\r\n    noble old Gladstone as Minister. Tears in the eyes of his\r\n    colleagues. He made his last speech as Minister in the House of\r\n    Commons, a grand and stirring one.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _January_ 23, 1895\r\n\r\n    Finished \"Erasmus\" a few days ago--a great intellect, much wit,\r\n    clear insight into the religion \"falsely so-called\" of monks and\r\n    clergy, but a soul not great enough to utter his convictions aloud\r\n    in the face of danger, or to perceive that conciliation beginning\r\n    by hypocrisy must end in worse strife and bitterness. He saw the\r\n    evil of the new dogmas and creeds introduced by Luther, of\r\n    _any_ new creed the rejection of which was penal, but he did\r\n    not or would not see the similar evil of the legally enforced old\r\n    creeds and dogmas.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _May_ 15, 1895\r\n\r\n    Armenian refugees here to tea--a husband and wife whose baby\r\n    _she_ had _seen_ murdered by Turkish soldiers, and a\r\n    friend who is uncertain whether his wife is alive or\r\n    murdered--these three in native dress; hers very picturesque, and\r\n    she herself beautiful. The three refugees, all of whom had been\r\n    eye-witnesses of massacres of relations, looked intensely sad. She\r\n    gave an account of some of the hardships they had suffered, but\r\n    neither they nor we could have borne details of the atrocities.\r\n    What they chiefly wished to express, and did express, was deep\r\n    gratitude for the sympathy of our country, veneration for the\r\n    memory of John as a friend of the Christian subjects of the Sultan,\r\n    and thanks to ourselves.... They kissed our hands repeatedly, and\r\n    the expression of their countenances as they looked at us, though\r\n    without words, was very touching.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _February_ 24, 1896\r\n\r\n    Visit from Mr. Voysey, earnest, interesting, and pathetic in\r\n    accounts of Whitechapel experiences. His Theism fills him with the\r\n    joy of unbounded faith in a perfect God; but his keen sense of the\r\n    evil done by the worship of Jesus as another and equal God leads\r\n    him to a painful blindness to that divine character and teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _August_ 5, 1897\r\n\r\n    Sinclair [115] has been reading a great deal to me since my illness\r\n    began. Miss Austen's \"Emma,\" which kept its high ground with me\r\n    although I had read it too often to find much novelty in the\r\n    marvellous humour and reality of the characters. Then \"Scenes of\r\n    Clerical Life\" ... the contrast between the minds and the\r\n    brain-work of Jane Austen and George Eliot very striking. Jane\r\n    Austen all ease and spontaneousness and simplicity, George Eliot\r\n    wonderful in strength and passion, and fond of probing the depths\r\n    of human anguish, but often ponderous in long-drawn philosophy and\r\n    metaphysics, and with a tediously cynical and flippant tone\r\n    underlying her portraits of human beings--and a wearisome lingering\r\n    over uninteresting details. Her defects are, I think, far more\r\n    prominent in this than in her best later books.\r\n\r\n[115] \"While in Norfolk Street (in 1882) engaged Sinclair, my good and\r\nfaithful Sinclair, as maid and housekeeper\" (_Recollections_). She\r\nremained with Lady Russell till her death, and served her with devotion to\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1897 she had a severe illness, from which, as the\r\nfollowing letter shows, she partially recovered.\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. Warburton to Lady Agatha Russell_\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _October_ 11, 1897\r\n\r\n    You can't imagine, or rather you can, what a happiness it is to be\r\n    able to record a perfect drive round the Park again with Mama this\r\n    most beautiful day, she enjoying it as of yore, and as full of\r\n    pleasure and observation as I ever remember. In short, it is quite\r\n    difficult to me to realize how ill she has been since I saw her in\r\n    June. She seems and looks so well. She is a marvellous person, so\r\n    young and fresh in all her interests, sight and hearing betraying\r\n    so little sign of change. She says she is out of practice, and her\r\n    _playing_ is not as easy or as vigorous as it was, I thought;\r\n    but how few people of her age would return to it at all after such\r\n    a long illness. (There are the sounds of music overhead as I sit\r\n    here in the drawing-room--how she enjoys it!) ... About the\r\n    reading--Dr. Gardiner [116] was against her being prevented from a\r\n    little--she enjoys it so much. Sinclair reading to her is a great\r\n    comfort.\r\n\r\n[116] Medical attendant and valued friend for over twelve years,\r\npartner to Dr. Anderson, of Richmond, with whom he attended Lady\r\nRussell till her death.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _November_ 15, 1897\r\n\r\n    Eighty-two this day. God be praised for all he has given to\r\n    brighten my old age. God be praised that I am still able to love,\r\n    to think, to rejoice, and to mourn with those dear to me. But the\r\n    burden of wasted years of a long life, in which I see failure on\r\n    every side, is weighty and painful, and can never be lightened. I\r\n    can only pray that the few steps left to me to take may be on a\r\n    holier path--the narrow path that leads to God. My own blessings\r\n    only brought more vividly to my mind the masses of toiling,\r\n    struggling, poverty-stricken fellow-creatures, from whom the\r\n    pressure of want shuts out the light of life.\r\n\r\n    My Agatha well, weather beautiful, and seventy very happy boys and\r\n    girls from the school to see a ventriloquist and his acting dolls\r\n    (drawing-room cleared for the occasion). The children's bursts and\r\n    shouts of laughter delightful to hear.\r\n\r\nLady Russell was wonderfully well that day--her last birthday on earth--and\r\njoined in the fun and laughter as heartily as any of the children. Old age\r\nhad not lessened her keen enjoyment of humour, nor dimmed the brightness of\r\nher brave spirit.\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _December_ 11, 1897\r\n\r\n    A beautiful day for old scholars' meeting. Ninety-four came, a\r\n    larger number than ever before; table spread in drawing-room and\r\n    bow-room. Not able to go down to see them, but all went well and\r\n    merrily. I was able to get to my sitting-room in the afternoon, and\r\n    all came up to me by turns for a hand-shake. It was pleasant to see\r\n    so many kindly, happy faces.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEMBROKE LODGE, _January_ 1, 1898\r\n\r\n    What will 1898 bring of joy or sorrow, good or evil, life or death,\r\n    to our home, our country, the world? May we be ready for all,\r\n    whatever it may be.\r\n\r\nSix days later she was attacked by influenza, which turned to bronchitis,\r\nand very soon she became seriously ill. There was for one day a slight hope\r\nthat she might recover, but the rally was only temporary, and soon it was\r\ncertain that death was near.\r\n\r\nThe last book that her daughter had been reading to her was the \"Life of\r\nTennyson,\" by his son, which she very much enjoyed. She begged her daughter\r\nto go on reading it to her in the last days of her life, and her keen\r\ninterest in it was wonderful, even when she was too ill to listen to more\r\nthan a few sentences at a time.\r\n\r\nFor some years Lady Russell had found great amusement and delight in the\r\nvisits of a little wild squirrel--squirrels abounded among the old trees at\r\nPembroke Lodge--which gradually became more and more tame and friendly. It\r\nused to climb up to her windows by a lilac-bush or a climbing rose-tree and\r\nlook brightly in at her while enjoying the nuts she gave it on the\r\nwindow-sill. Before long it became very venturesome, and would enter the\r\nroom daily and frisk about, or sit on her writing-table or on the tea-table\r\nin perfect content, taking food from her hand. On the last day of her life\r\nthe doctor [117] was sitting by her bedside when suddenly he noticed the\r\nbeautiful little squirrel bounding in at her window. It was only a few\r\nhours before she died, but her face lighted up at once, and she welcomed\r\nher faithful little friend, for the last time, with her brightest smile.\r\n\r\n[117] Dr. Anderson, who had been for nearly thirty years a true and devoted\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nDuring her illness she had spoken confidently of recovery, but the night\r\nbefore her death she realized quite clearly that the end was near. Her son\r\nand daughter were with her; and just before she sank into a last sleep she\r\nspoke, in a firm clear voice, words of love and faith. Her mind had\r\nremained unclouded, and her end was as calm and peaceful as those who loved\r\nher could have wished. She died on January 17, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe immense number of letters received by Lady Russell's son and daughter,\r\nfrom men and women of all classes and creeds, bore striking testimony to\r\nthe widespread and reverent devotion felt for her memory. Only very few\r\nselections will be given here. The first letter--written on the day of her\r\ndeath--is from Mr. Farrington, the respected minister of the Richmond Free\r\nChurch, who had known Lady Russell intimately for many years.\r\n\r\n    _Rev. Silas Farrington to Lady Agatha Russell_\r\n\r\n    _January_ 17, 1898\r\n\r\n    To me your mother has become more and more an inspiration--a kind\r\n    of tower of cheerful courage and strength. By her steadfast mental\r\n    and moral bravery, by the sunshine she has been beneath the heavy\r\n    clouds that have been sweeping over her, she has made one ashamed\r\n    of the small things that troubled him and rebuked his petty\r\n    discontent and repining. No one can ever be told how much I both\r\n    have honoured and loved her for the very greatness of her noble\r\n    spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Rev. Stopford A. Brooke to Lady Agatha Russell_\r\n\r\n    _January_ 18, 1898\r\n\r\n    How little I thought when I saw Lady Russell last [118] that I\r\n    should see her no more! She looked so full of life, and her\r\n    interest in all things was so keen and eager that I never for a\r\n    moment thought her old or linked to her lite the imagination of\r\n    death. It is a sore loss to lose one so fresh, so alive, so ardent\r\n    in all good and beautiful things, and it must leave you in a great\r\n    loneliness.... How well, how nobly she lived her life! It shames us\r\n    to think of all she did, and yet it kindles us so much that we lose\r\n    our shame in its inspiration.\r\n\r\n[118] On October 31, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Frederic Harrison to Lady Agatha Russell_\r\n\r\n    _February_ 16, 1898\r\n\r\n    ...The news of the great sorrow which has fallen on you came upon\r\n    my wife and myself as a dreadful surprise.... Over and over again I\r\n    tried to say to the world outside all that I felt of the noble\r\n    nature and the grand life of your mother, but every time I tried my\r\n    pen fell from my hand. I was too sad to think or write; full only\r\n    of the sense of the friend whom I had lost, and of the great\r\n    example she has left to our generation. She has fulfilled her\r\n    mission on earth, and all those who have known her--and they are\r\n    very many--will all their lives be sustained by the memory of her\r\n    courage, dignity, and truth. She had so much of the character of\r\n    the Roman matron--a type we know so little nowadays--who, being\r\n    perfect in all the beauty of domestic life, yet even more\r\n    conspicuously raised the public life of her time. I shall never,\r\n    while I have life, forget the occasions this last summer and autumn\r\n    when I had been able to see more of her than ever before, and\r\n    especially that last hour I spent with her, when you were away at\r\n    Weston, the memory of which now comes back to me like a death-bed\r\n    parting. To have known her was to ride above the wretched party\r\n    politics to which our age is condemned. I cannot bear to think of\r\n    all that this bereavement means to you. It must be, and will\r\n    remain, irreparable.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Mr. James Bryce [119] to Lady Agatha Russell_\r\n\r\n    _March_ 10, 1898\r\n\r\n    Your mother always seemed to me one of the most noble and beautiful\r\n    characters I had ever known--there was in her so much gentleness,\r\n    so much firmness, so much earnestness, so ardent a love for all\r\n    high things and all the best causes. One always came away from\r\n    seeing her struck afresh by these charms of nature, and feeling the\r\n    better for having seen how old age had in no way lessened her\r\n    interest in the progress of the world, her faith in the triumph of\r\n    good.\r\n\r\n[119] The Right Hon. James Bryce, British Ambassador at Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. Sinclair to Mr. Rollo Russell_\r\n\r\n    _January_, 1900\r\n\r\n    I loved and honoured my dear lady more than any one I ever served.\r\n    In my long life of service, where all had been good and kind to me,\r\n    she was the dearest and best.\r\n\r\nThe funeral service was held on the 21st of January in the village church\r\nat Chenies, where her husband had been buried among his ancestors. The\r\nBurial Service of the Church of England, the solemnity and beauty of which\r\nshe had always deeply felt, was read in the presence of many friends and\r\nrelations assembled to pay their last tribute of respect to her memory.\r\n\r\nNot long before her death Lady Russell had written these lines:\r\n\r\n  O shadowy form majestic, nearer gliding,\r\n  And ever nearer! Thou whose silent tread\r\n  Not ocean, chasm, or mountain can delay,\r\n  Not even hands in agony outstretched,\r\n  Or bitterest tears of breaking hearts, that fain\r\n  Would stay thy dread approach to those most dear.\r\n  Vainly from thee we seek to hide; thou wield'st\r\n  A sceptred power that none below may challenge;\r\n  Yet no true monarch thou--but Messenger\r\n  Of Him, Monarch supreme and Love eternal,\r\n  Who holdeth of all mysteries the key;--\r\n  And in thy dark unfathomable eyes\r\n  A star of promise lieth.\r\n  Then O! despite all failure, guilt and error,\r\n  Crushing beneath their weight my faltering soul,\r\n  When my hour striketh, when with Time I part,\r\n  When face to face we stand, with naught between,\r\n  Come as a friend, O Death!\r\n  Lay gently thy cold hand upon my brow,\r\n  And still the fevered throb of this blind life,\r\n  This fragment, mournful yet so fair--this dream,\r\n  Aspiring, earth-bound, passionate--and waft me\r\n  Where broken harmonies will blend once more,\r\n  And severed hearts once more together beat;\r\n  Where, in our Father's fold, all, all shall be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nRECOLLECTIONS OF FRANCES, COUNTESS RUSSELL\r\n\r\nBY JUSTIN McCARTHY\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the dearest and most treasured memories of my lifetime are those\r\nbelonging to the years during which I had the honour of being received\r\namong her friends by the late Countess Russell.\r\n\r\nThat friendship lasted more than twenty years, and its close on this earth\r\nwas only brought about by Lady Russell's death.\r\n\r\nThere hangs now in my study, seeming to look down upon me while I write, a\r\nphotograph of Lady Russell with her name written on it in her own\r\nhandwriting. That photograph I received but a short time before her death,\r\nand it is to be with me so long as I live and look upon this earth.\r\n\r\nI had some slight, very slight, acquaintance with the late Earl Russell,\r\never best known to fame as Lord John Russell, some years before I became\r\none of his wife's friends. I met Lord John Russell for the first time in\r\n1858, when he was attending a meeting of the Social Science Association,\r\nheld in Liverpool, where I was then a young journalist, and I had the good\r\nfortune to be presented to him. After that, when I settled in London, I met\r\nhim occasionally in the precincts of Westminster Palace, and I had some\r\ninteresting conversations with him which I have mentioned in published\r\nrecollections of mine. During all that time I had, however, but a merely\r\nslight and formal acquaintanceship with his gifted wife.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to know her more closely she had settled herself in her home at\r\nPembroke Lodge in Richmond Park, and it is with that delightful home that\r\nmy memories of her are mainly associated. She received her friends and\r\nacquaintances in general there on certain appointed days in each week. I\r\nneed hardly say how gladly I availed myself of every opportunity for the\r\nenjoyment of such a visit, and especially for the enjoyment of Lady\r\nRussell's conversation and companionship.\r\n\r\nI have known many gifted women, among them many gifted authoresses, but I\r\nhave not known any woman who could have surpassed Lady Russell in the\r\nvaried charms of her conversation. Most of us, men and women, have usually\r\nthe habit of carrying our occupations with us, metaphorically at least,\r\nwherever we go, and therefore have some difficulty in entering with full\r\nappreciation into conversational fields in which we do not find ourselves\r\nquite at home.\r\n\r\nLady Russell was not like most of us in that quality. Her chief natural\r\ninterest, one might readily suppose, would have been centred in questions\r\nbelonging to the domain of politics, national and international, she having\r\nbeen for so great a part of her life the wife and the close companion of\r\none of England's leading statesmen.\r\n\r\nBut Lady Russell was endowed with a peculiarly receptive mind, and she felt\r\nan interest quite natural and spontaneous in every subject which could\r\ninterest educated and rational human beings--in art, literature, and\r\nscience; in the history and the growth of all countries; in the condition\r\nof the poor and the struggling throughout the world; in every effort made\r\nby knowledge, benevolence, and enlightened purpose for the benefit of\r\nhumanity. She had evidently also a strong desire to add to her own large\r\nstock of information, and she appears to have felt that whenever she came\r\ninto converse with any fellow-being she was in communication with one who\r\ncould tell her something which she did not already know.\r\n\r\nIn this characteristic she reminded me strongly of William Ewart Gladstone.\r\n\r\nThere is, or there used to be, a common impression throughout many social\r\ncircles in this country, that when Gladstone in private was the centre of\r\nany company, he generally contrived to keep most of the talk to himself.\r\nThis always seemed to me an entire misconception, for I had many\r\nopportunities of observing that Gladstone in social companionship seemed\r\nmuch more anxious to get some new ideas from those around him than to pour\r\nout to them from his own treasures of information.\r\n\r\nLady Russell loved to draw forth from the artist something about his art,\r\nfrom the scholar something about his books, to compare the ideas of the\r\npolitician with her own, to lead the traveller into accounts of his\r\ntravels, to get from the scientific student some of his experiences in this\r\nor that domain of science, and from those who visited the poor some\r\nsuggestions which might serve her during her constant work in the same\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nEven on subjects concerning which the greatest and sharpest divisions of\r\nopinion might naturally arise--political questions, for instance--Lady\r\nRussell seemed as much interested in listening to the clear exposition and\r\ndefence of a political opponent's views as she might have been in the\r\ncordial exchange of sympathetic and encouraging opinions. When I first\r\nbegan to make one of Lady Russell's frequent visitors, there was, of\r\ncourse, between us a natural sympathy of political opinion which was made\r\nall the stronger because of momentous events that had lately passed, or\r\nwere then passing, in the world around.\r\n\r\nThe great Civil War in the North American States had come to an end many\r\nyears before I began to visit Lady Russell at her home, and I need hardly\r\nremind my readers that by far the larger proportion of what we call\r\n\"society\" in England had given its sympathies entirely to the cause of the\r\nSouth, and had firmly maintained, almost to the very end, that the South\r\nwas destined to have a complete victory over its opponents. Lady Russell\r\ngave her sympathies to the side of the Northern States, as was but natural,\r\nseeing that the success of the North would mean the abolition of that\r\nsystem of slavery which was to her heart and to her conscience incapable of\r\ndefence or of palliation.\r\n\r\nI had paid my first visit to the United States not many years after the end\r\nof the Civil War--a visit prolonged for nearly two years and extending from\r\nNew York to San Francisco and from Maine to Louisiana. I had therefore a\r\ngood deal to tell Lady Russell about the various experiences I had had\r\nduring this my first visit to the now reunited States, and the lights which\r\nthey threw for me on the origin and causes of the Civil War.\r\n\r\nI may say here that Lady Russell was always very anxious that the public\r\nshould fully understand and appreciate the attitude taken by her late\r\nhusband with regard to the Civil War. In a letter written to me on October\r\n20, 1879, Lady Russell refers me to a speech made by her husband on March\r\n23, 1863, and she goes on to say:\r\n\r\nIt shows unanswerably how strong was his opinion against the recognition of\r\nthe Southern States, even at a moment when the tide of battle was so much\r\nin their favour that he, in common, I think, with most others, looked upon\r\nseparation as likely to be the final issue. As long as the abolition of\r\nslavery was not openly announced, as he thought it ought to have been, as\r\none of the main objects of the war on the part of the Federals, he felt no\r\nwarm sympathy with their cause. But after President Lincoln's proclamation\r\nit was quite different, and no man rejoiced with deeper thankfulness than\r\nhe did at the final triumph of the Northern States, for no man held slavery\r\nin more utter abhorrence.\r\n\r\nI have thought it well to introduce this quotation just here because it is\r\nassociated at once with my earliest recollections of Lady Russell, and at\r\nthe same time with a subject of controversy which may almost be said to\r\nhave passed out of the realms of disputation since that day.\r\n\r\nThe American States have now long been absolutely reunited; there is no\r\ndifference of opinion whatever in this country with regard to the question\r\nof slavery, and yet it is quite certain that during the American Civil War\r\na large number of conscientious, humane, and educated Englishmen were\r\nfirmly convinced that the American Republic was about to break in two, and\r\nthat the sympathies of England ought to go with the rebelling Southern\r\nStates. It is well, therefore, that we should all be reminded of Lord\r\nRussell's attitude on these subjects.\r\n\r\nI had much to tell Lady Russell of the various impressions made on me\r\nduring my wanderings through the States, and by the distinguished American\r\nauthors, statesmen, soldiers--Emerson, Longfellow, Bryant, Oliver Wendell\r\nHolmes, Charles Sumner, Wendell Phillips, General Grant, General Sherman.\r\nWith the public career of each of these men Lady Russell was thoroughly\r\nacquainted, but she was much interested in hearing all that I could tell\r\nher about their ways of life and their personal habits and characteristics.\r\n\r\nThen there were, of course, political questions at home concerning which\r\nthere was deep sympathy between Lady Russell and me, and on which we had\r\nmany long conversations. She had the most intense and enlightened sympathy\r\nwith the great movements going on in these countries for the spread of\r\npolitical equality and of popular education.\r\n\r\nEvery statesman who sincerely and actively supported the principles and\r\nmeasures tending towards these ends was regarded as a friend by this\r\nnoble-hearted woman.\r\n\r\nI had been for many years a leader-writer and more recently editor of the\r\n_Morning Star_, the London daily newspaper which advocated the views\r\nof Cobden and Bright, and I had more recently still been elected to the\r\nHouse of Commons as a member of the Irish Nationalist Party, and thus again\r\nI found myself in thorough sympathy with the opinions and the feelings of\r\nmy hostess.\r\n\r\nLady Russell had long been an advocate of that truly Liberal policy towards\r\nIreland which is now accepted as the only principle by all really\r\nenlightened Liberal English men and women; and she thoroughly understood\r\nthe condition, the grievances, the needs, and the aspirations of Ireland.\r\nThe readers of this volume will see in some passages extracted from Lady\r\nRussell's diaries and letters how deep and strong were her feelings on the\r\nsubject. She followed with the most intense interest and with the most\r\npenetrating observation the whole movement of Ireland's national struggle\r\ndown to the very close of her life. Her letters on this question\r\nalone--letters addressed to me--would in themselves serve to illumine even\r\nnow the minds of many English readers on this whole subject. Lady Russell\r\nwas in no sense a partisan on any political question--I mean she never gave\r\nher approval to everything said or done by the leaders of any political\r\nparty merely because the one main object of that party had her full\r\nsympathy and approval. Reading over many of her letters to me on various\r\npassages of the Home Rule agitation inside and outside Parliament, I have\r\nbeen once again filled with admiration and with wonder at the keen\r\nsagacity, the prophetic instinct, which she displayed with regard to this\r\nor that political movement or political man.\r\n\r\nAll through these letters it becomes more and more manifest that Lady\r\nRussell's devotedness was in every instance to principle rather than to\r\nparty, to measures rather than to men. By these words I do not mean to\r\nconvey the idea that her nature led her habitually into any cold and\r\nover-calculating criticism of political leaders whom she admired, and in\r\nwhom she had been led to feel confidence.\r\n\r\nHer generous nature was enthusiastic in its admiration of the men whose\r\nleadership in some great political movement had won her sympathy from the\r\nfirst; but even with these her admiration was overruled and kept in order\r\nby her devotion to the principles which they were undertaking to carry into\r\neffect, and by the fidelity with which they adhered to these principles.\r\nEven among intelligent and enlightened men and women we often find in our\r\nobservation of public affairs that there are instances in which the\r\nfollowers of a trusted leader are carried away by their personal devotion\r\ninto the championship of absolute errors which the leader is\r\ncommitting--errors that might prove perilous or even, for the time, fatal\r\nto the cause of which he is the recognised advocate.\r\n\r\nLady Russell always set the cause above the man, regarding him mainly as\r\nthe instrument of the cause; and if the alternative were pressed upon her,\r\nwould have withdrawn from his leadership rather than tacitly allow the\r\ncause to be misled. This, however, would have been done only as a last\r\nresort and after the most full, patient, and generous consideration of the\r\npersonal as well as the public question.\r\n\r\nWe men do not expect to find in an enthusiastic, tender, and what may be\r\ncalled exquisitely feminine woman the quality of clear and guiding\r\ndiscrimination between the policy of the leader and the principles of the\r\ncause which he undertakes to lead. We are inclined to assume that the woman\r\nin such a case, if she has already made a hero of the man, will be apt to\r\nthink that everything he proposes to do must be the right thing to do, and\r\nthat any question raised as to the wisdom and justice of any course adopted\r\nby him is a treason against his leadership.\r\n\r\nLady Russell never seemed to me to yield for a moment to any such sentiment\r\nof mere hero-worship. She set, as I have said, the cause above the man, and\r\nshe measured the man according to her interpretation of his policy towards\r\nthe cause.\r\n\r\nBut at the same time she was never one of those who cannot be convinced\r\nthat some particular course is not the wisest and most just to adopt\r\nwithout at once rushing to the conclusion that the leader who makes any\r\nmistakes must be in the wrong because of wilfulness or mere incapacity, and\r\nis therefore not worthy any longer of admiration and trust.\r\n\r\nI have many letters from her, written at the time of some serious crisis in\r\nthe fortunes of the Irish National movement, which show the keenest and the\r\nearliest intelligence of some mistake in the policy of the party on this or\r\nthat immediate question without showing the slightest inclination to\r\ndiminish her confidence in the sincerity and the purposes of its leaders,\r\nany more than in the justice of the cause. I can well recollect that in\r\nmany instances she proved to be absolutely in the right when she thus gave\r\nme her opinion, and that events afterwards fully maintained the wisdom and\r\nthe justice of her criticism. The reason why so many of Lady Russell's\r\nopinions were conveyed to me by letter was that I had to be, like all my\r\ncompanions of the Irish Parliamentary Party, a constant attendant at the\r\ndebates in the House of Commons, and that many days often passed without my\r\nhaving an opportunity to visit Lady Russell and converse with her on the\r\nsubjects which had so deep an interest for her as well as for me. I\r\ntherefore was in the habit of writing often to her from the House of\r\nCommons in order to give her my own ideas as to the significance and\r\nimportance of this or that debate, of this or that speech and its probable\r\neffect on the House and on the outer public. Lady Russell never failed to\r\nfavour me with her own views on such subjects, and the views were always\r\nher own, and were never a mere good-natured and friendly adoption of the\r\nopinions thus offered to her.\r\n\r\nThen, when I had the opportunity of visiting her at Pembroke Lodge, we were\r\nsure to compare and discuss our views in the conversations which she made\r\nso delightful and so inspiring.\r\n\r\nOne of her marvellous qualities was that her interest and her intellect\r\nwere never wholly absorbed in the passing political questions, but that she\r\ncould still keep her mind open to other and entirely different subjects.\r\nThe chamber of her mind seemed to me to be like one of those mysterious\r\napartments about which we read in fairy stories, which were endowed with a\r\nmagical capacity of expansion and reception.\r\n\r\nI have come to her home at a time when, for those whose lives were mainly\r\npassed in political work, there was some subject then engaging the\r\nattention of all politicians in these countries--some subject in which I\r\nwell knew that Lady Russell was deeply and thoroughly interested.\r\n\r\nBut it sometimes happened that there were friends just then with her who\r\ndid not profess any interest in politics, and who were mainly concerned\r\nabout some new topic in letters or art or science, and I often observed\r\nwith admiration the manner in which Lady Russell could give herself up for\r\nthe time to the question in which those visitors were chiefly interested,\r\nand could show her sympathy and knowledge as if she had not lately been\r\nthinking of anything else. About this there was evidently no mere desire to\r\nplease her latest visitors, no sense of obligation to submit herself for\r\nthe time to their especial subject, but a genuine sympathy with every\r\neffort of human intellect, and a sincere desire to gather all that could be\r\ngathered from every garden of human culture.\r\n\r\nMany of Lady Russell's letters to me on the events and the fortunes, the\r\nhopes and the disasters of our Irish National movement have in them an\r\nactual historical interest, such as the one dated November 27, 1890, which\r\nis quoted in this volume. It was written during the crisis which came upon\r\nour Irish National party at the time when the hopes of Mr. Parnell's most\r\ndevoted friends in England as well as in Ireland were that after the result\r\nof a recent divorce suit Parnell would resign, for a time at least, the\r\nleadership of the party and only seek to return to it when he should have\r\nmade what reparation was in his power to his own honour and to public\r\nfeeling. In a letter of December 26, 1891, Lady Russell says: \"Your poor\r\ncountry has risen victorious from many a worse fall, and will not be\r\ndisheartened now, nor bate a jot of heart or hope.\"\r\n\r\nLady Russell's letters not merely illustrate her deep and noble sympathy\r\nwith the cause and the hopes of Ireland, but also they are evidence of the\r\nclear judgment and foresight which were qualities at once of her intellect\r\nand of her feeling. Scattered throughout her letters to me are many other\r\nevidences of the same kind with regard to other great political and social\r\nquestions then coming up at home or abroad. I wish to say, however, that\r\nher letters do not by any means occupy themselves only with political\r\nquestions, with Parliamentary debates, and with legislative measures. To\r\nparaphrase the words of the great Latin poet, whatever men and women were\r\ndoing in arts and letters, in social progress, and in all that concerns\r\nhumanity, supplied congenial subjects for the letters written by this most\r\ngifted, most observant, most intellectual woman to her friends.\r\n\r\nOne certainly has not lived in vain who has had the honour of being\r\nadmitted to that friendship for some twenty years.\r\n\r\nI have no words, literally none, in which to express adequately the\r\nadmiration and the affection and the devotion which I felt for Lady\r\nRussell. No higher type of womanhood has yet been born into our modern\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nLady Agatha Russell is rendering a most valuable service to humanity in\r\npreparing and giving to the world the records of her mother's life which\r\nappear in this volume. A monument more appropriate and more noble could not\r\nbe raised over any grave than that which the daughter is thus raising to\r\nthe memory of her mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nMEMORIAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nBY FREDERIC HARRISON\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Lady Russell's death a few friends decided--unknown to her family,\r\nwho were touched by this mark of respect--to put up a tablet to her memory\r\nand hold a Memorial Service in the Free Church at Richmond, Surrey. The\r\ntablet, which is of beaten copper, beautifully worked, bears the following\r\ninscription:--\r\n\r\nIn memory of Frances Anna Maria, daughter of Gilbert, second Earl of Minto,\r\nand widow of Lord John Russell, who was born November 15, 1815, and died\r\nJanuary 17, 1898. In gratitude to God for her noble life this tablet is\r\nplaced by her fellow-worshippers.\r\n\r\nThe Memorial Service was held on July 14, 1900, when the tablet was\r\nunveiled and the following address was delivered by Mr. Frederic Harrison.\r\n\r\n    Now that our gathering of to-day has given full scope to the loving\r\n    sorrow and filial piety of the children, descendants, and family of\r\n    her whom we meet to commemorate and honour--now that the minister,\r\n    whom she was accustomed to hear, and the worshippers, with whom she\r\n    was wont to join in praise and prayer, have recorded their solemn\r\n    union in the same sacred memory, I crave leave to offer my humble\r\n    tribute of devotion as representing the general circle of her\r\n    friends, and the far wider circle of the public to whom she was\r\n    known only by her life, her character, her nobility of soul, and\r\n    her benefactions.\r\n\r\n    I do not presume to speak of that beauty of nature which Frances\r\n    Countess Russell showed in the sanctity of the family, in the close\r\n    intimacy of her private friends. Others have done this far more\r\n    truly, and will continue to bear witness to her life whilst this\r\n    generation and the next shall survive. My only title to join my\r\n    voice to-day with that of her children and of this congregation\r\n    resides in the fact that my memory of her goes back over so long a\r\n    period; that I have known her under circumstances, first, of the\r\n    highest public activity, and then again, in a time of severe\r\n    retirement and private simplicity; that I have seen her in days of\r\n    happiness and in days of mourning; at the height of her influence\r\n    and dignity in the eyes of our nation and of the nations about us,\r\n    as well as in her days of grief and disappointment at the failure\r\n    of her hopes, and the break up of the causes she had at heart. And\r\n    I have known her always, in light or in gloom, in joy or in misery,\r\n    the same brave, fearless, natural, and true heart--come fair or\r\n    foul, come triumph or defeat.\r\n\r\n    Yes! it was my privilege to have known Lady Russell in the lifetime\r\n    of the eminent statesman whose name she bore, and whose life of\r\n    toil in the public service she inspired; I knew them\r\n    five-and-thirty years ago, when he was at the head of the State\r\n    Government and immersed in public cares. And I am one of those who\r\n    can bear witness to the simple dignity with which she adorned that\r\n    high station and office, and the beautiful affection and quiet\r\n    peace of the home-life she maintained, like a Roman matron, when\r\n    her husband was called to serve the State. And it so happened that\r\n    I passed part of the last summer that she lived to see, here in\r\n    Richmond, within a short walk of her house. There I saw her\r\n    constantly and held many conversations with her upon public\r\n    affairs; and perhaps those were amongst the last occasions on which\r\n    her powerful sense and heroic spirit had full play before the fatal\r\n    illness which supervened in that very autumn.\r\n\r\n    I do not hesitate to speak of her powerful sense and her heroic\r\n    spirit, for she united the statesman-like insight into political\r\n    problems with the unflinching courage to stand by the cause of\r\n    truth, humanity, and justice. She was not impulsive at all, not\r\n    hasty in forming her decisions, still less did she seek publicity\r\n    or take pleasure in heading a movement. But, with the great\r\n    experience of politicians and of political things which in her long\r\n    life and her rare opportunities she had acquired, she saw straight\r\n    to the heart of so many vexed problems of our day; and when once\r\n    convinced of the truth, she held fast to it with a noble\r\n    intrepidity of soul. In a life more or less conversant with public\r\n    men now for forty years past, I have rarely known either man or\r\n    woman who had a more sound judgment in great public questions. And\r\n    I have known none who surpassed her in courage, in directness, and\r\n    in fixity of purpose. No sense that she and her friends had to meet\r\n    overwhelming odds would ever make her faint-hearted. No desertion\r\n    by friends and old comrades ever caused her to waver. No despair\r\n    ever touched that stalwart soul, however dark the outlook might\r\n    appear; for it was her faith that no right or just cause was ever\r\n    really lost, however for the time it were defeated and contemned.\r\n\r\n    Lady Frances Elliot, as she was before marriage, came of a race of\r\n    soldiers, governors, and tried servants of the State, and she\r\n    married into a race which has long stood in the front rank of the\r\n    historic servants of the Crown and of the people. But neither the\r\n    house of Elliot nor that of Russell in so many generations ever\r\n    bred man or woman with a keener sense of public duty, a more\r\n    generous nature, and a more magnanimous soul. In the annals of that\r\n    famous house, whose traditions are part of the history of England,\r\n    there has been no finer example of the old motto, _noblesse\r\n    oblige_, if we understand it to mean--those who have high place\r\n    inherit with it heavy responsibilities. That idea was the breath of\r\n    her life to Countess Russell, as assuredly it was also to her\r\n    husband, and she whose memory we keep sacred to-day is worthy to\r\n    take her place beside that Rachel Lady Russell of old, who, more\r\n    than two centuries ago, suffered so deeply in the cause of freedom\r\n    and of conscience; she whose blood runs in the veins of the\r\n    children who to-day revere the memory of their mother.\r\n\r\n    The Italians call a man of heroic nature--a Garibaldi or a\r\n    Manin--_uomo antico_--\"one of the ancient type\"--one whom we\r\n    rarely see in our modern days of getting on in the world and\r\n    following the popular cry. I have never heard the phrase applied to\r\n    a lady, and, perhaps, _donna antica_ might be held to bear a\r\n    double sense. But we need some such phrase to describe the fine\r\n    quality of the spirit which lit up the whole nature of Frances\r\n    Countess Russell. She had within her that rare flame which we\r\n    attribute to the martyrs of our sacred and secular histories--that\r\n    power of inspiring those whom she impressed with the resolve to do\r\n    the right, to seek the truth, to defend the oppressed, at all cost,\r\n    and against all odds.\r\n\r\n    It has been my privilege to have listened to many men and to some\r\n    women who in various countries and in different causes have been\r\n    held to have exerted great influence, and to have forced ideas,\r\n    principles, and reforms on the men of their time. But I have\r\n    listened to none in our country or abroad who seemed to me to\r\n    inspire the spirit more purely with the desire to hold fast by the\r\n    right, to thrust aside the wrong, to be just, faithful,\r\n    considerate, and honourable, to feel for the fatherless and the\r\n    poor, and not to despise the humble and the meek. I know that all\r\n    my remaining term of life there will remain deeply engraven on my\r\n    memory all that she said, all that she felt, in the last\r\n    conversation I ever held with her at the very commencement of her\r\n    last fatal illness. Weak and suffering as she was, unable to rise\r\n    from her invalid chair, she asked me to come and tell her what I\r\n    knew, and to hear what she felt about the public crisis of that\r\n    time (I speak of the end of 1897). The storm of South Africa was\r\n    even then rising like a cloud no bigger than a man's hand out of\r\n    the southern seas. I listened to her: and her deep and thrilling\r\n    words of indignation, shame, pity, and honour sank into my mind, as\r\n    if they had been the last words of some pure and higher spirit that\r\n    was about to leave us, but would not leave us without words of\r\n    warning and exhortation to follow honour, to serve truth, to eschew\r\n    evil and to do good, to seek peace and ensue it. I knew well that I\r\n    was listening to her for the last time; for her life was visibly\r\n    ebbing away. But I listened to her as to one who was passing into a\r\n    world of greater permanence and of more spiritual meaning than our\r\n    fleeting and too material world of sense and sight. And for the\r\n    rest of my life I shall continue to bear in my heart this message\r\n    as it seemed to me of a nobler world and of a higher truth.\r\n\r\n    Yes! she has passed into a nobler world and to a higher truth--the\r\n    world of the good and just men and women whose memory survives\r\n    their mortal career, and whose inspiring influence works for good\r\n    ever in generations to come. In this Free Church I can speak\r\n    freely, for I too profoundly believe in a future life of every good\r\n    and pure soul beyond the grave, in the perpetuity of every just and\r\n    noble life in the sum of human progress and enlightenment. And in a\r\n    sense that is quite as real as yours, even if it differ from your\r\n    sense in form, I also make bold to say, this corruptible must put\r\n    on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality--Death is\r\n    swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave,\r\n    where is thy victory? Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye\r\n    steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of Humanity, for\r\n    as much as ye know that your labour is not in vain in Humanity.\r\n\r\n    Surely we have before us a high example of what it is to be\r\n    steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in good work, in the memory\r\n    of Frances Elliot Countess Russell, who united in herself\r\n    principles typified in the historic mottoes of her own house and\r\n    that of her husband's--who kept her high courage under all\r\n    adversities and opposition, in the spirit of _che sarà sarà_,\r\n    \"stand fast come what may\"--in the spirit of that other motto of\r\n    the Elliots, _suaviter el fortiter_, \"with all the gentleness\r\n    of a woman and all the fortitude of a man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\nAbbotsford\r\nAbercromby, Lady Mary (_see also_ Dunfermline, Lady)--\r\n  Marriage\r\n  letters from Lady John Russell\r\n  letters from Lady Minto\r\n  correspondence with Lord John Russell\r\n  letter from Lord Minto\r\n  visit of Lady John Russell\r\n  _mentioned_ in the letters\r\nAbercromby, Mr. Ralph, afterwards Lord Dunfermline\r\n  Minister at the Hague\r\nAberdeen, Lord--\r\n  The Ecclesiastical Titles Bill\r\n  consents to form a Ministry\r\n  and Lord John Russell\r\n  and the Eastern Question\r\n  and Reform\r\n  Lord John's resignation\r\n  Lord John's appreciation of\r\n  resignation\r\nAbergeldie Castle\r\nActon, Lord, \"Historical Essays and Studies\"\r\nAdams, Mr.\r\nAdelaide, queen of William IV\r\nAdmiralty, the,\r\n  Lord Minto at\r\n  Mrs. Drummond's description\r\n\"Adullamites,\" the\r\nAffirmation Bill, Gladstone's\r\n_Alabama_, case of the\r\nAlbert Hall, foundation stone laid\r\nAlbert, Prince Consort--\r\n  and Lord John\r\n  Prussian sympathies\r\n  visit to Pembroke Lodge\r\n  and Italy\r\n  at Coburg\r\n  death\r\n  \"Trent\" affair\r\n  \"Life of Prince Albert,\"\r\n  _otherwise mentioned_\r\nAldworth\r\nAllen, Grant, \"Science in Arcady\"\r\nAlthorp, Lord\r\n  and the Irish Coercion Bill\r\nAmberley, Lady\r\n  death of\r\nAmberley, Lord, _see also_ Russell, John--\r\n  Engagement\r\n  defeated at Leeds\r\n  returned for Nottingham\r\n  maiden speech\r\n  defeat in 1868\r\n  letters from Lady Russell\r\n  death of\r\n  _otherwise mentioned_\r\nAmerican Civil War, the--\r\n  England's position\r\n  seizure of the Southern Commissioners\r\n  Lord Russell's speech on\r\n  feeling in England\r\nAnderson, Dr., of Richmond\r\nAnti-Corn Law League bazaar at Manchester\r\nArmenian refugees at Pembroke Lodge\r\n_Arrow_, the, coasting vessel\r\nAthanasian Creed, the\r\nAumale, Duc d'\r\nAusten, Jane\r\n  \"Emma,\"\r\nAustria--\r\n  Influence in Germany\r\n  unpopularity of the Government\r\n  and Denmark\r\n  Palmerston's policy towards\r\n  Conference of Vienna\r\n  proposals of, and resignation of Lord John Russell\r\n  and Italy\r\n  after Solferino\r\n  Peace of Villafranca\r\n  and the proposed Congress at Zurich\r\n  Prussian war on\r\n  cession of Venetia\r\n  cause of the Franco-German War\r\nAzeglio, Marquis d', Piedmontese Minister\r\n\r\n\r\nBalmoral\r\n  Lord John Russell at\r\nBaring, Mr., Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\n  tariff proposals\r\nBeaumont, Lord\r\nBedford, (6th) Duke of\r\nBedford, (7th) Duke of,\r\n  letters from Lord Russell\r\n  visit of Lord and Lady John Russell\r\n  on the attacks on Lord John\r\n  letter from Lady John\r\n  death\r\nBedford, (9th) Duke of\r\nBennett, Rev.
