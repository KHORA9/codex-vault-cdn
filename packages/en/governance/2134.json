Art and Advertisement\r\n\r\nI propose, subject to the patience of the reader, to devote two or\r\nthree articles to prophecy. Like all healthy-minded prophets, sacred and\r\nprofane, I can only prophesy when I am in a rage and think things look\r\nugly for everybody. And like all healthy-minded prophets, I prophesy in\r\nthe hope that my prophecy may not come true. For the prediction made by\r\nthe true soothsayer is like the warning given by a good doctor. And the\r\ndoctor has really triumphed when the patient he condemned to death has\r\nrevived to life. The threat is justified at the very moment when it is\r\nfalsified. Now I have said again and again (and I shall continue to say\r\nagain and again on all the most inappropriate occasions) that we must\r\nhit Capitalism, and hit it hard, for the plain and definite reason that\r\nit is growing stronger. Most of the excuses which serve the capitalists\r\nas masks are, of course, the excuses of hypocrites. They lie when they\r\nclaim philanthropy; they no more feel any particular love of men than\r\nAlbu felt an affection for Chinamen. They lie when they say they have\r\nreached their position through their own organising ability. They\r\ngenerally have to pay men to organise the mine, exactly as they pay\r\nmen to go down it. They often lie about the present wealth, as they\r\ngenerally lie about their past poverty. But when they say that they\r\nare going in for a “constructive social policy,” they do not lie. They\r\nreally are going in for a constructive social policy. And we must go in\r\nfor an equally destructive social policy; and destroy, while it is still\r\nhalf-constructed, the accursed thing which they construct.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Example of the Arts\r\n\r\nNow I propose to take, one after another, certain aspects and\r\ndepartments of modern life, and describe what I think they will be like\r\nin this paradise of plutocrats, this Utopia of gold and brass in which\r\nthe great story of England seems so likely to end. I propose to say what\r\nI think our new masters, the mere millionaires, will do with certain\r\nhuman interests and institutions, such as art, science, jurisprudence,\r\nor religion--unless we strike soon enough to prevent them. And for the\r\nsake of argument I will take in this article the example of the arts.\r\n\r\nMost people have seen a picture called “Bubbles,” which is used for the\r\nadvertisement of a celebrated soap, a small cake of which is introduced\r\ninto the pictorial design. And anybody with an instinct for design (the\r\ncaricaturist of the Daily Herald, for instance), will guess that it was\r\nnot originally a part of the design. He will see that the cake of soap\r\ndestroys the picture as a picture; as much as if the cake of soap had\r\nbeen used to Scrub off the paint. Small as it is, it breaks and confuses\r\nthe whole balance of objects in the composition. I offer no judgment\r\nhere upon Millais’s action in the matter; in fact, I do not know what\r\nit was. The important point for me at the moment is that the picture\r\nwas not painted for the soap, but the soap added to the picture. And\r\nthe spirit of the corrupting change which has separated us from that\r\nVictorian epoch can be best seen in this: that the Victorian atmosphere,\r\nwith all its faults, did not permit such a style of patronage to pass as\r\na matter of course. Michael Angelo may have been proud to have helped an\r\nemperor or a pope; though, indeed, I think he was prouder than they\r\nwere on his own account. I do not believe Sir John Millais was proud of\r\nhaving helped a soap-boiler. I do not say he thought it wrong; but he\r\nwas not proud of it. And that marks precisely the change from his time\r\nto our own. Our merchants have really adopted the style of merchant\r\nprinces. They have begun openly to dominate the civilisation of the\r\nState, as the emperors and popes openly dominated in Italy. In Millais’s\r\ntime, broadly speaking, art was supposed to mean good art; advertisement\r\nwas supposed to mean inferior art. The head of a black man, painted\r\nto advertise somebody’s blacking, could be a rough symbol, like an inn\r\nsign. The black man had only to be black enough. An artist exhibiting\r\nthe picture of a negro was expected to know that a black man is not so\r\nblack as he is painted. He was expected to render a thousand tints of\r\ngrey and brown and violet: for there is no such thing as a black man\r\njust as there is no such thing as a white man. A fairly clear line\r\nseparated advertisement from art.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Effect\r\n\r\nI should say the first effect of the triumph of the capitalist (if\r\nwe allow him to triumph) will be that that line of demarcation will\r\nentirely disappear. There will be no art that might not just as well be\r\nadvertisement. I do not necessarily mean that there will be no good art;\r\nmuch of it might be, much of it already is, very good art. You may put\r\nit, if you please, in the form that there has been a vast improvement in\r\nadvertisements. Certainly there would be nothing surprising if the head\r\nof a negro advertising Somebody’s Blacking now adays were finished\r\nwith as careful and subtle colours as one of the old and superstitious\r\npainters would have wasted on the negro king who brought gifts to\r\nChrist. But the improvement of advertisements is the degradation of\r\nartists. It is their degradation for this clear and vital reason: that\r\nthe artist will work, not only to please the rich, but only to increase\r\ntheir riches; which is a considerable step lower. After all, it was as\r\na human being that a pope took pleasure in a cartoon of Raphael or a\r\nprince took pleasure in a statuette of Cellini. The prince paid for\r\nthe statuette; but he did not expect the statuette to pay him. It is my\r\nimpression that no cake of soap can be found anywhere in the cartoons\r\nwhich the Pope ordered of Raphael. And no one who knows the small-minded\r\ncynicism of our plutocracy, its secrecy, its gambling spirit, its\r\ncontempt of conscience, can doubt that the artist-advertiser will often\r\nbe assisting enterprises over which he will have no moral control, and\r\nof which he could feel no moral approval. He will be working to spread\r\nquack medicines, queer investments; and will work for Marconi instead of\r\nMedici. And to this base ingenuity he will have to bend the proudest\r\nand purest of the virtues of the intellect, the power to attract his\r\nbrethren, and the noble duty of praise. For that picture by Millais is\r\na very allegorical picture. It is almost a prophecy of what uses are\r\nawaiting the beauty of the child unborn. The praise will be of a kind\r\nthat may correctly be called soap; and the enterprises of a kind that\r\nmay truly be described as Bubbles.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Letters and the New Laureates\r\n\r\nIn these articles I only take two or three examples of the first and\r\nfundamental fact of our time. I mean the fact that the capitalists of\r\nour community are becoming quite openly the kings of it. In my last (and\r\nfirst) article, I took the case of Art and advertisement. I pointed out\r\nthat Art must be growing worse--merely because advertisement is growing\r\nbetter. In those days Millais condescended to Pears’ soap. In these days\r\nI really think it would be Pears who condescended to Millais. But here\r\nI turn to an art I know more about, that of journalism. Only in my ease\r\nthe art verges on artlessness.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty with the English lies in the absence of something\r\none may call democratic imagination. We find it easy to realise an\r\nindividual, but very hard to realise that the great masses consist of\r\nindividuals. Our system has been aristocratic: in the special sense of\r\nthere being only a few actors on the stage. And the back scene is kept\r\nquite dark, though it is really a throng of faces. Home Rule tended to\r\nbe not so much the Irish as the Grand Old Man. The Boer War tended not\r\nto be so much South Africa as simply “Joe.” And it is the amusing but\r\ndistressing fact that every class of political leadership, as it comes\r\nto the front in its turn, catches the rays of this isolating lime-light;\r\nand becomes a small aristocracy. Certainly no one has the aristocratic\r\ncomplaint so badly as the Labour Party. At the recent Congress, the real\r\ndifference between Larkin and the English Labour leaders was not so much\r\nin anything right or wrong in what he said, as in something elemental\r\nand even mystical in the way he suggested a mob. But it must be plain,\r\neven to those who agree with the more official policy, that for Mr.\r\nHavelock Wilson the principal question was Mr. Havelock Wilson; and that\r\nMr. Sexton was mainly considering the dignity and fine feelings of Mr.\r\nSexton. You may say they were as sensitive as aristocrats, or as sulky\r\nas babies; the point is that the feeling was personal. But Larkin, like\r\nDanton, not only talks like ten thousand men talking, but he also has\r\nsome of the carelessness of the colossus of Arcis; “Que mon nom soit\r\nfletri, que la France soit libre.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA Dance of Degradation\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that this respecting of persons has led all the\r\nother parties a dance of degradation. We ruin South Africa because it\r\nwould be a slight on Lord Gladstone to save South Africa. We have a bad\r\narmy, because it would be a snub to Lord Haldane to have a good army.\r\nAnd no Tory is allowed to say “Marconi” for fear Mr. George should say\r\n“Kynoch.” But this curious personal element, with its appalling lack of\r\npatriotism, has appeared in a new and curious form in another department\r\nof life; the department of literature, especially periodical literature.\r\nAnd the form it takes is the next example I shall give of the way in\r\nwhich the capitalists are now appearing, more and more openly, as the\r\nmasters and princes of the community.\r\n\r\nI will take a Victorian instance to mark the change; as I did in the\r\ncase of the advertisement of “Bubbles.” It was said in my childhood, by\r\nthe more apoplectic and elderly sort of Tory, that W. E. Gladstone was\r\nonly a Free Trader because he had a partnership in Gilbey’s foreign\r\nwines. This was, no doubt, nonsense; but it had a dim symbolic, or\r\nmainly prophetic, truth in it. It was true, to some extent even then,\r\nand it has been increasingly true since, that the statesman was often an\r\nally of the salesman; and represented not only a nation of shopkeepers,\r\nbut one particular shop. But in Gladstone’s time, even if this was true,\r\nit was never the whole truth; and no one would have endured it being the\r\nadmitted truth. The politician was not solely an eloquent and persuasive\r\nbagman travelling for certain business men; he was bound to mix even his\r\ncorruption with some intelligible ideals and rules of policy. And the\r\nproof of it is this: that at least it was the statesman who bulked\r\nlarge in the public eye; and his financial backer was entirely in the\r\nbackground. Old gentlemen might choke over their port, with the moral\r\ncertainty that the Prime Minister had shares in a wine merchant’s. But\r\nthe old gentleman would have died on the spot if the wine merchant had\r\nreally been made as important as the Prime Minister. If it had been\r\nSir Walter Gilbey whom Disraeli denounced, or Punch caricatured; if\r\nSir Walter Gilbey’s favourite collars (with the design of which I am\r\nunacquainted) had grown as large as the wings of an archangel; if\r\nSir Walter Gilbey had been credited with successfully eliminating the\r\nBritish Oak with his little hatchet; if, near the Temple and the\r\nCourts of Justice, our sight was struck by a majestic statue of a\r\nwine merchant; or if the earnest Conservative lady who threw a\r\ngingerbread-nut at the Premier had directed it towards the wine merchant\r\ninstead, the shock to Victorian England would have been very great\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaloes for Employers\r\n\r\nNow something very like that is happening; the mere wealthy employer is\r\nbeginning to have not only the power but some of the glory. I have\r\nseen in several magazines lately, and magazines of a high class, the\r\nappearance of a new kind of article. Literary men are being employed to\r\npraise a big business man personally, as men used to praise a king. They\r\nnot only find political reasons for the commercial schemes--that they\r\nhave done for some time past--they also find moral defences for the\r\ncommercial schemers. They describe the capitalist’s brain of steel and\r\nheart of gold in a way that Englishmen hitherto have been at least in\r\nthe habit of reserving for romantic figures like Garibaldi or Gordon. In\r\none excellent magazine Mr. T. P. O’Connor, who, when he likes, can write\r\non letters like a man of letters, has some purple pages of praise of\r\nSir Joseph Lyons--the man who runs those teashop places. He incidentally\r\nbrought in a delightful passage about the beautiful souls possessed\r\nby some people called Salmon and Gluckstein. I think I like best the\r\npassage where he said that Lyons’s charming social accomplishments\r\nincluded a talent for “imitating a Jew.” The article is accompanied with\r\na large and somewhat leering portrait of that shopkeeper, which makes\r\nthe parlour-trick in question particularly astonishing. Another literary\r\nman, who certainly ought to know better, wrote in another paper a piece\r\nof hero-worship about Mr. Selfridge. No doubt the fashion will spread,\r\nand the art of words, as polished and pointed by Ruskin or Meredith,\r\nwill be perfected yet further to explore the labyrinthine heart of\r\nHarrod; or compare the simple stoicism of Marshall with the saintly\r\ncharm of Snelgrove.\r\n\r\nAny man can be praised--and rightly praised. If he only stands on two\r\nlegs he does something a cow cannot do. If a rich man can manage to\r\nstand on two legs for a reasonable time, it is called self-control. If\r\nhe has only one leg, it is called (with some truth) self-sacrifice. I\r\ncould say something nice (and true) about every man I have ever met.\r\nTherefore, I do not doubt I could find something nice about Lyons or\r\nSelfridge if I searched for it. But I shall not. The nearest postman or\r\ncab-man will provide me with just the same brain of steel and heart\r\nof gold as these unlucky lucky men. But I do resent the whole age\r\nof patronage being revived under such absurd patrons; and all poets\r\nbecoming court poets, under kings that have taken no oath, nor led us\r\ninto any battle.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Unbusinesslike Business\r\n\r\nThe fairy tales we were all taught did not, like the history we were all\r\ntaught, consist entirely of lies. Parts of the tale of “Puss in Boots”\r\n or “Jack and the Beanstalk” may strike the realistic eye as a little\r\nunlikely and out of the common way, so to speak; but they contain some\r\nvery solid and very practical truths. For instance, it may be noted\r\nthat both in “Puss in Boots” and “Jack and the Beanstalk” if I remember\r\naright, the ogre was not only an ogre but also a magician. And it will\r\ngenerally be found that in all such popular narratives, the king, if he\r\nis a wicked king, is generally also a wizard. Now there is a very vital\r\nhuman truth enshrined in this. Bad government, like good government,\r\nis a spiritual thing. Even the tyrant never rules by force alone; but\r\nmostly by fairy tales. And so it is with the modern tyrant, the great\r\nemployer. The sight of a millionaire is seldom, in the ordinary sense,\r\nan enchanting sight: nevertheless, he is in his way an enchanter. As\r\nthey say in the gushing articles about him in the magazines, he is a\r\nfascinating personality. So is a snake. At least he is fascinating to\r\nrabbits; and so is the millionaire to the rabbit-witted sort of people\r\nthat ladies and gentlemen have allowed themselves to become. He does,\r\nin a manner, cast a spell, such as that which imprisoned princes and\r\nprincesses under the shapes of falcons or stags. He has truly turned men\r\ninto sheep, as Circe turned them into swine.\r\n\r\nNow, the chief of the fairy tales, by which he gains this glory and\r\nglamour, is a certain hazy association he has managed to create between\r\nthe idea of bigness and the idea of practicality. Numbers of the\r\nrabbit-witted ladies and gentlemen do really think, in spite of\r\nthemselves and their experience, that so long as a shop has hundreds\r\nof different doors and a great many hot and unhealthy underground\r\ndepartments (they must be hot; this is very important), and more people\r\nthan would be needed for a man-of-war, or crowded cathedral, to say:\r\n“This way, madam,” and “The next article, sir,” it follows that\r\nthe goods are good. In short, they hold that the big businesses are\r\nbusinesslike. They are not. Any housekeeper in a truthful mood, that\r\nis to say, any housekeeper in a bad temper, will tell you that they are\r\nnot. But housekeepers, too, are human, and therefore inconsistent and\r\ncomplex; and they do not always stick to truth and bad temper. They are\r\nalso affected by this queer idolatry of the enormous and elaborate; and\r\ncannot help feeling that anything so complicated must go like clockwork.\r\nBut complexity is no guarantee of accuracy--in clockwork or in anything\r\nelse. A clock can be as wrong as the human head; and a clock can stop,\r\nas suddenly as the human heart.\r\n\r\nBut this strange poetry of plutocracy prevails over people against their\r\nvery senses. You write to one of the great London stores or emporia,\r\nasking, let us say, for an umbrella. A month or two afterwards you\r\nreceive a very elaborately constructed parcel, containing a broken\r\nparasol. You are very pleased. You are gratified to reflect on what\r\na vast number of assistants and employees had combined to break that\r\nparasol. You luxuriate in the memory of all those long rooms and\r\ndepartments and wonder in which of them the parasol that you never\r\nordered was broken. Or you want a toy elephant for your child on\r\nChristmas Day; as children, like all nice and healthy people, are very\r\nritualistic. Some week or so after Twelfth Night, let us say, you have\r\nthe pleasure of removing three layers of pasteboards, five layers of\r\nbrown paper, and fifteen layers of tissue paper and discovering the\r\nfragments of an artificial crocodile. You smile in an expansive spirit.\r\nYou feel that your soul has been broadened by the vision of incompetence\r\nconducted on so large a scale. You admire all the more the colossal\r\nand Omnipresent Brain of the Organiser of Industry, who amid all his\r\nmultitudinous cares did not disdain to remember his duty of smashing\r\neven the smallest toy of the smallest child. Or, supposing you have\r\nasked him to send you some two rolls of cocoa-nut matting: and supposing\r\n(after a due interval for reflection) he duly delivers to you the five\r\nrolls of wire netting. You take pleasure in the consideration of a\r\nmystery: which coarse minds might have called a mistake. It consoles you\r\nto know how big the business is: and what an enormous number of people\r\nwere needed to make such a mistake.\r\n\r\nThat is the romance that has been told about the big shops; in the\r\nliterature and art which they have bought, and which (as I said in\r\nmy recent articles) will soon be quite indistinguishable from their\r\nordinary advertisements. The literature is commercial; and it is\r\nonly fair to say that the commerce is often really literary. It is no\r\nromance, but only rubbish.\r\n\r\nThe big commercial concerns of to-day are quite exceptionally\r\nincompetent. They will be even more incompetent when they are\r\nomnipotent. Indeed, that is, and always has been, the whole point of\r\na monopoly; the old and sound argument against a monopoly. It is only\r\nbecause it is incompetent that it has to be omnipotent. When one large\r\nshop occupies the whole of one side of a street (or sometimes both\r\nsides), it does so in order that men may be unable to get what they\r\nwant; and may be forced to buy what they don’t want. That the rapidly\r\napproaching kingdom of the Capitalists will ruin art and letters, I\r\nhave already said. I say here that in the only sense that can be called\r\nhuman, it will ruin trade, too.\r\n\r\nI will not let Christmas go by, even when writing for a revolutionary\r\npaper necessarily appealing to many with none of my religious\r\nsympathies, without appealing to those sympathies. I knew a man who sent\r\nto a great rich shop for a figure for a group of Bethlehem. It arrived\r\nbroken. I think that is exactly all that business men have now the sense\r\nto do.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. The War on Holidays\r\n\r\nThe general proposition, not always easy to define exhaustively, that\r\nthe reign of the capitalist will be the reign of the cad--that is, of\r\nthe unlicked type that is neither the citizen nor the gentleman--can\r\nbe excellently studied in its attitude towards holidays. The special\r\nemblematic Employer of to-day, especially the Model Employer (who is\r\nthe worst sort) has in his starved and evil heart a sincere hatred of\r\nholidays. I do not mean that he necessarily wants all his workmen to\r\nwork until they drop; that only occurs when he happens to be stupid as\r\nwell as wicked. I do not mean to say that he is necessarily unwilling to\r\ngrant what he would call “decent hours of labour.” He may treat men like\r\ndirt; but if you want to make money, even out of dirt, you must let\r\nit lie fallow by some rotation of rest. He may treat men as dogs, but\r\nunless he is a lunatic he will for certain periods let sleeping dogs\r\nlie.\r\n\r\nBut humane and reasonable hours for labour have nothing whatever to do\r\nwith the idea of holidays. It is not even a question of ten hours day\r\nand eight-hours day; it is not a question of cutting down leisure to\r\nthe space necessary for food, sleep and exercise. If the modern employer\r\ncame to the conclusion, for some reason or other, that he could get most\r\nout of his men by working them hard for only two hours a day, his whole\r\nmental attitude would still be foreign and hostile to holidays. For his\r\nwhole mental attitude is that the passive time and the active time are\r\nalike useful for him and his business. All is, indeed, grist that\r\ncomes to his mill, including the millers. His slaves still serve him in\r\nunconsciousness, as dogs still hunt in slumber. His grist is ground not\r\nonly by the sounding wheels of iron, but by the soundless wheel of blood\r\nand brain. His sacks are still filling silently when the doors are shut\r\non the streets and the sound of the grinding is low.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Great Holiday\r\n\r\nNow a holiday has no connection with using a man either by beating or\r\nfeeding him. When you give a man a holiday you give him back his body\r\nand soul. It is quite possible you may be doing him an injury (though\r\nhe seldom thinks so), but that does not affect the question for those to\r\nwhom a holiday is holy. Immortality is the great holiday; and a holiday,\r\nlike the immortality in the old theologies, is a double-edged privilege.\r\nBut wherever it is genuine it is simply the restoration and completion\r\nof the man. If people ever looked at the printed word under their eye,\r\nthe word “recreation” would be like the word “resurrection,” the blast\r\nof a trumpet.\r\n\r\n\r\nA man, being merely useful, is necessarily incomplete, especially if\r\nhe be a modern man and means by being useful being “utilitarian.” A man\r\ngoing into a modern club gives up his hat; a man going into a modern\r\nfactory gives up his head. He then goes in and works loyally for the old\r\nfirm to build up the great fabric of commerce (which can be done without\r\na head), but when he has done work he goes to the cloak-room, like the\r\nman at the club, and gets his head back again; that is the germ of the\r\nholiday. It may be urged that the club man who leaves his hat often goes\r\naway with another hat; and perhaps it may be the same with the factory\r\nhand who has left his head. A hand that has lost its head may affect the\r\nfastidious as a mixed metaphor; but, God pardon us all, what an unmixed\r\ntruth! We could almost prove the whole ease from the habit of calling\r\nhuman beings merely “hands” while they are working; as if the hand were\r\nhorribly cut off, like the hand that has offended; as if, while the\r\nsinner entered heaven maimed, his unhappy hand still laboured laying\r\nup riches for the lords of hell. But to return to the man whom we found\r\nwaiting for his head in the cloak-room. It may be urged, we say, that he\r\nmight take the wrong head, like the wrong hat; but here the similarity\r\nceases. For it has been observed by benevolent onlookers at life’s drama\r\nthat the hat taken away by mistake is frequently better than the real\r\nhat; whereas the head taken away after the hours of toil is certainly\r\nworse: stained with the cobwebs and dust of this dustbin of all the\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Adventure\r\n\r\nAll the words dedicated to places of eating and drinking are pure\r\nand poetic words. Even the word “hotel” is the word hospital. And St.\r\nJulien, whose claret I drank this Christmas, was the patron saint of\r\ninnkeepers, because (as far as I can make out) he was hospitable to\r\nlepers. Now I do not say that the ordinary hotel-keeper in Piccadilly or\r\nthe Avenue de l’Opera would embrace a leper, slap him on the back, and\r\nask him to order what he liked; but I do say that hospitality is his\r\ntrade virtue. And I do also say it is well to keep before our eyes the\r\nsupreme adventure of a virtue. If you are brave, think of the man who\r\nwas braver than you. If you are kind, think of the man who was kinder\r\nthan you.\r\n\r\nThat is what was meant by having a patron saint. That is the link\r\nbetween the poor saint who received bodily lepers and the great hotel\r\nproprietor who (as a rule) receives spiritual lepers. But a word yet\r\nweaker than “hotel” illustrates the same point--the word “restaurant.”\r\n There again you have the admission that there is a definite building or\r\nstatue to “restore”; that ineffaceable image of man that some call the\r\nimage of God. And that is the holiday; it is the restaurant or restoring\r\nthing that, by a blast of magic, turns a man into himself.\r\n\r\nThis complete and reconstructed man is the nightmare of the modern\r\ncapitalist. His whole scheme would crack across like a mirror of\r\nShallot, if once a plain man were ready for his two plain duties--ready\r\nto live and ready to die. And that horror of holidays which marks the\r\nmodern capitalist is very largely a horror of the vision of a whole\r\nhuman being: something that is not a “hand” or a “head for figures.” But\r\nan awful creature who has met himself in the wilderness. The employers\r\nwill give time to eat, time to sleep; they are in terror of a time to\r\nthink.\r\n\r\nTo anyone who knows any history it is wholly needless to say that\r\nholidays have been destroyed. As Mr. Belloc, who knows much more\r\nhistory than you or I, recently pointed out in the “Pall Mall Magazine,”\r\n Shakespeare’s title of “Twelfth Night: or What You Will” simply meant\r\nthat a winter carnival for everybody went on wildly till the twelfth\r\nnight after Christmas. Those of my readers who work for modern offices\r\nor factories might ask their employers for twelve days’ holidays after\r\nChristmas. And they might let me know the reply.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE CHURCH OF THE SERVILE STATE\r\n\r\nI confess I cannot see why mere blasphemy by itself should be an excuse\r\nfor tyranny and treason; or how the mere isolated fact of a man not\r\nbelieving in God should be a reason for my believing in Him.\r\n\r\nBut the rather spinsterish flutter among some of the old Freethinkers\r\nhas put one tiny ripple of truth in it; and that affects the idea which\r\nI wish to emphasise even to monotony in these pages. I mean the idea\r\nthat the new community which the capitalists are now constructing will\r\nbe a very complete and absolute community; and one which will tolerate\r\nnothing really independent of itself. Now, it is true that any positive\r\ncreed, true or false, would tend to be independent of itself. It might\r\nbe Roman Catholicism or Mahomedanism or Materialism; but, if strongly\r\nheld, it would be a thorn in the side of the Servile State. The Moslem\r\nthinks all men immortal: the Materialist thinks all men mortal. But the\r\nMoslem does not think the rich Sinbad will live forever; but the poor\r\nSinbad will die on his deathbed. The Materialist does not think that Mr.\r\nHaeckel will go to heaven, while all the peasants will go to pot, like\r\ntheir chickens. In every serious doctrine of the destiny of men, there\r\nis some trace of the doctrine of the equality of men. But the capitalist\r\nreally depends on some religion of inequality. The capitalist must\r\nsomehow distinguish himself from human kind; he must be obviously above\r\nit--or he would be obviously below it. Take even the least attractive\r\nand popular side of the larger religions to-day; take the mere vetoes\r\nimposed by Islam on Atheism or Catholicism. The Moslem veto upon\r\nintoxicants cuts across all classes. But it is absolutely necessary for\r\nthe capitalist (who presides at a Licensing Committee, and also at a\r\nlarge dinner), it is absolutely necessary for him, to make a distinction\r\nbetween gin and champagne. The Atheist veto upon all miracles cuts\r\nacross all classes. But it is absolutely necessary for the capitalist to\r\nmake a distinction between his wife (who is an aristocrat and consults\r\ncrystal gazers and star gazers in the West End), and vulgar miracles\r\nclaimed by gipsies or travelling showmen. The Catholic veto upon usury,\r\nas defined in dogmatic councils, cuts across all classes. But it is\r\nabsolutely necessary to the capitalist to distinguish more delicately\r\nbetween two kinds of usury; the kind he finds useful and the kind he\r\ndoes not find useful. The religion of the Servile State must have no\r\ndogmas or definitions. It cannot afford to have any definitions. For\r\ndefinitions are very dreadful things: they do the two things that most\r\nmen, especially comfortable men, cannot endure. They fight; and they\r\nfight fair.\r\n\r\nEvery religion, apart from open devil worship, must appeal to a virtue\r\nor the pretence of a virtue. But a virtue, generally speaking, does some\r\ngood to everybody. It is therefore necessary to distinguish among\r\nthe people it was meant to benefit those whom it does benefit. Modern\r\nbroad-mindedness benefits the rich; and benefits nobody else. It was\r\nmeant to benefit the rich; and meant to benefit nobody else. And if you\r\nthink this unwarranted, I will put before you one plain question. There\r\nare some pleasures of the poor that may also mean profits for the rich:\r\nthere are other pleasures of the poor which cannot mean profits for the\r\nrich? Watch this one contrast, and you will watch the whole creation of\r\na careful slavery.\r\n\r\nIn the last resort the two things called Beer and Soap end only in a\r\nfroth. They are both below the high notice of a real religion. But\r\nthere is just this difference: that the soap makes the factory more\r\nsatisfactory, while the beer only makes the workman more satisfied. Wait\r\nand see if the Soap does not increase and the Beer decrease. Wait and\r\nsee whether the religion of the Servile State is not in every case what\r\nI say: the encouragement of small virtues supporting capitalism, the\r\ndiscouragement of the huge virtues that defy it. Many great religions,\r\nPagan and Christian, have insisted on wine. Only one, I think, has\r\ninsisted on Soap. You will find it in the New Testament attributed to\r\nthe Pharisees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. SCIENCE AND THE EUGENISTS\r\n\r\nThe key fact in the new development of plutocracy is that it will use\r\nits own blunder as an excuse for further crimes. Everywhere the very\r\ncompleteness of the impoverishment will be made a reason for the\r\nenslavement; though the men who impoverished were the same who enslaved.\r\nIt is as if a highwayman not only took away a gentleman’s horse and all\r\nhis money, but then handed him over to the police for tramping without\r\nvisible means of subsistence. And the most monstrous feature in this\r\nenormous meanness may be noted in the plutocratic appeal to science, or,\r\nrather, to the pseudo-science that they call Eugenics.\r\n\r\nThe Eugenists get the ear of the humane but rather hazy cliques by\r\nsaying that the present “conditions” under which people work and breed\r\nare bad for the race; but the modern mind will not generally stretch\r\nbeyond one step of reasoning, and the consequence which appears to\r\nfollow on the consideration of these “conditions” is by no means what\r\nwould originally have been expected. If somebody says: “A rickety cradle\r\nmay mean a rickety baby,” the natural deduction, one would think, would\r\nbe to give the people a good cradle, or give them money enough to buy\r\none. But that means higher wages and greater equalisation of wealth; and\r\nthe plutocratic scientist, with a slightly troubled expression, turns\r\nhis eyes and pince-nez in another direction. Reduced to brutal terms of\r\ntruth, his difficulty is this and simply this: More food, leisure, and\r\nmoney for the workman would mean a better workman, better even from the\r\npoint of view of anyone for whom he worked. But more food, leisure, and\r\nmoney would also mean a more independent workman. A house with a decent\r\nfire and a full pantry would be a better house to make a chair or mend\r\na clock in, even from the customer’s point of view, than a hovel with a\r\nleaky roof and a cold hearth. But a house with a decent fire and a full\r\npantry would also be a better house in which to refuse to make a chair\r\nor mend a clock--a much better house to do nothing in--and doing nothing\r\nis sometimes one of the highest of the duties of man. All but the\r\nhard-hearted must be torn with pity for this pathetic dilemma of the\r\nrich man, who has to keep the poor man just stout enough to do the work\r\nand just thin enough to have to do it. As he stood gazing at the leaky\r\nroof and the rickety cradle in a pensive manner, there one day came into\r\nhis mind a new and curious idea--one of the most strange, simple, and\r\nhorrible ideas that have ever risen from the deep pit of original sin.\r\n\r\nThe roof could not be mended, or, at least, it could not be mended much,\r\nwithout upsetting the capitalist balance, or, rather, disproportion in\r\nsociety; for a man with a roof is a man with a house, and to that extent\r\nhis house is his castle. The cradle could not be made to rock easier,\r\nor, at least, not much easier, without strengthening the hands of the\r\npoor household, for the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world--to\r\nthat extent. But it occurred to the capitalist that there was one sort\r\nof furniture in the house that could be altered. The husband and wife\r\ncould be altered. Birth costs nothing, except in pain and valour and\r\nsuch old-fashioned things; and the merchant need pay no more for mating\r\na strong miner to a healthy fishwife than he pays when the miner mates\r\nhimself with a less robust female whom he has the sentimentality to\r\nprefer. Thus it might be possible, by keeping on certain broad lines\r\nof heredity, to have some physical improvement without any moral,\r\npolitical, or social improvement. It might be possible to keep a\r\nsupply of strong and healthy slaves without coddling them with decent\r\nconditions. As the mill-owners use the wind and the water to drive their\r\nmills, they would use this natural force as something even cheaper; and\r\nturn their wheels by diverting from its channel the blood of a man in\r\nhis youth. That is what Eugenics means; and that is all that it means.\r\n\r\nOf the moral state of those who think of such things it does not become\r\nus to speak. The practical question is rather the intellectual one:\r\nof whether their calculations are well founded, and whether the men\r\nof science can or will guarantee them any such physical certainties.\r\nFortunately, it becomes clearer every day that they are, scientifically\r\nspeaking, building on the shifting sand. The theory of breeding slaves\r\nbreaks down through what a democrat calls the equality of men, but which\r\neven an oligarchist will find himself forced to call the similarity of\r\nmen. That is, that though it is not true that all men are normal, it is\r\noverwhelmingly certain that most men are normal. All the common Eugenic\r\narguments are drawn from extreme cases, which, even if human honour\r\nand laughter allowed of their being eliminated, would not by their\r\nelimination greatly affect the mass. For the rest, there remains the\r\nenormous weakness in Eugenics, that if ordinary men’s judgment or\r\nliberty is to be discounted in relation to heredity, the judgment of\r\nthe judges must be discounted in relation to their heredity. The Eugenic\r\nprofessor may or may not succeed in choosing a baby’s parents; it is\r\nquite certain that he cannot succeed in choosing his own parents. All\r\nhis thoughts, including his Eugenic thoughts, are, by the very principle\r\nof those thoughts, flowing from a doubtful or tainted source. In short,\r\nwe should need a perfectly Wise Man to do the thing at all. And if he\r\nwere a Wise Man he would not do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. THE EVOLUTION OF THE PRISON\r\n\r\nI have never understood why it is that those who talk most about\r\nevolution, and talk it in the very age of fashionable evolutionism, do\r\nnot see the one way in which evolution really does apply to our modern\r\ndifficulty. There is, of course, an element of evolutionism in the\r\nuniverse; and I know no religion or philosophy that ever entirely\r\nignored it. Evolution, popularly speaking, is that which happens to\r\nunconscious things. They grow unconsciously; or fade unconsciously; or\r\nrather, some parts of them grow and some parts of them fade; and at any\r\ngiven moment there is almost always some presence of the fading thing,\r\nand some incompleteness in the growing one. Thus, if I went to sleep\r\nfor a hundred years, like the Sleeping Beauty (I wish I could), I should\r\ngrow a beard--unlike the Sleeping Beauty. And just as I should grow\r\nhair if I were asleep, I should grow grass if I were dead. Those whose\r\nreligion it was that God was asleep were perpetually impressed\r\nand affected by the fact that he had a long beard. And those whose\r\nphilosophy it is that the universe is dead from the beginning (being\r\nthe grave of nobody in particular) think that is the way that grass can\r\ngrow. In any case, these developments only occur with dead or dreaming\r\nthings. What happens when everyone is asleep is called Evolution. What\r\nhappens when everyone is awake is called Revolution.\r\n\r\nThere was once an honest man, whose name I never knew, but whose face\r\nI can almost see (it is framed in Victorian whiskers and fixed in a\r\nVictorian neck-cloth), who was balancing the achievements of France and\r\nEngland in civilisation and social efficiencies. And when he came to the\r\nreligious aspect he said that there were more stone and brick churches\r\nused in France; but, on the other hand, there are more sects in England.\r\nWhether such a lively disintegration is a proof of vitality in any\r\nvaluable sense I have always doubted. The sun may breed maggots in a\r\ndead dog; but it is essential for such a liberation of life that the dog\r\nshould be unconscious or (to say the least of it) absent-minded. Broadly\r\nspeaking, you may call the thing corruption, if you happen to like dogs.\r\nYou may call it evolution, if you happen to like maggots. In either\r\ncase, it is what happens to things if you leave them alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Evolutionists’ Error\r\n\r\nNow, the modern Evolutionists have made no real use of the idea of\r\nevolution, especially in the matter of social prediction. They always\r\nfall into what is (from their logical point of view) the error of\r\nsupposing that evolution knows what it is doing. They predict the State\r\nof the future as a fruit rounded and polished. But the whole point of\r\nevolution (the only point there is in it) is that no State will ever be\r\nrounded and polished, because it will always contain some organs that\r\noutlived their use, and some that have not yet fully found theirs. If we\r\nwish to prophesy what will happen, we must imagine things now moderate\r\ngrown enormous; things now local grown universal; things now promising\r\ngrown triumphant; primroses bigger than sunflowers, and sparrows\r\nstalking about like flamingoes.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we must ask what modern institution has a future before\r\nit? What modern institution may have swollen to six times its present\r\nsize in the social heat and growth of the future? I do not think the\r\nGarden City will grow: but of that I may speak in my next and last\r\narticle of this series. I do not think even the ordinary Elementary\r\nSchool, with its compulsory education, will grow. Too many unlettered\r\npeople hate the teacher for teaching; and too many lettered people\r\nhate the teacher for not teaching. The Garden City will not bear much\r\nblossom; the young idea will not shoot, unless it shoots the teacher.\r\nBut the one flowering tree on the estate, the one natural expansion\r\nwhich I think will expand, is the institution we call the Prison.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrisons for All\r\n\r\nIf the capitalists are allowed to erect their constructive capitalist\r\ncommunity, I speak quite seriously when I say that I think Prison will\r\nbecome an almost universal experience. It will not necessarily be a\r\ncruel or shameful experience: on these points (I concede certainly for\r\nthe present purpose of debate) it may be a vastly improved experience.\r\nThe conditions in the prison, very possibly, will be made more humane.\r\nBut the prison will be made more humane only in order to contain more of\r\nhumanity. I think little of the judgment and sense of humour of any man\r\nwho can have watched recent police trials without realising that it is\r\nno longer a question of whether the law has been broken by a crime; but,\r\nnow, solely a question of whether the situation could be mended by an\r\nimprisonment. It was so with Tom Mann; it was so with Larkin; it was so\r\nwith the poor atheist who was kept in gaol for saying something he\r\nhad been acquitted of saying: it is so in such cases day by day. We no\r\nlonger lock a man up for doing something; we lock him up in the hope\r\nof his doing nothing. Given this principle, it is evidently possible\r\nto make the mere conditions of punishment more moderate, or--(more\r\nprobably) more secret. There may really be more mercy in the Prison,\r\non condition that there is less justice in the Court. I should not be\r\nsurprised if, before we are done with all this, a man was allowed to\r\nsmoke in prison, on condition, of course, that he had been put in prison\r\nfor smoking.\r\n\r\nNow that is the process which, in the absence of democratic protest,\r\nwill certainly proceed, will increase and multiply and replenish the\r\nearth and subdue it. Prison may even lose its disgrace for a little\r\ntime: it will be difficult to make it disgraceful when men like Larkin\r\ncan be imprisoned for no reason at all, just as his celebrated ancestor\r\nwas hanged for no reason at all. But capitalist society, which naturally\r\ndoes not know the meaning of honour, cannot know the meaning of\r\ndisgrace: and it will still go on imprisoning for no reason at all. Or\r\nrather for that rather simple reason that makes a cat spring or a rat\r\nrun away.\r\n\r\nIt matters little whether our masters stoop to state the matter in the\r\nform that every prison should be a school; or in the more candid form\r\nthat every school should be a prison. They have already fulfilled their\r\nservile principle in the case of the schools. Everyone goes to the\r\nElementary Schools except the few people who tell them to go there. I\r\nprophesy that (unless our revolt succeeds) nearly everyone will be going\r\nto Prison, with a precisely similar patience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. THE LASH FOR LABOUR\r\n\r\nIf I were to prophesy that two hundred years hence a grocer would have\r\nthe right and habit of beating the grocer’s assistant with a stick, or\r\nthat shop girls might be flogged, as they already can be fined, many\r\nwould regard it as rather a rash remark. It would be a rash remark.\r\nProphecy is always unreliable; unless we except the kind which is\r\navowedly irrational, mystical and supernatural prophecy. But relatively\r\nto nearly all the other prophecies that are being made around me to-day,\r\nI should say my prediction stood an exceptionally good chance. In short,\r\nI think the grocer with the stick is a figure we are far more likely to\r\nsee than the Superman or the Samurai, or the True Model Employer, or the\r\nPerfect Fabian Official, or the citizen of the Collectivist State. And\r\nit is best for us to see the full ugliness of the transformation which\r\nis passing over our Society in some such abrupt and even grotesque image\r\nat the end of it. The beginnings of a decline, in every age of history,\r\nhave always had the appearance of being reforms. Nero not only fiddled\r\nwhile Rome was burning, but he probably really paid more attention to\r\nthe fiddle than to the fire. The Roi Soleil, like many other soleils,\r\nwas most splendid to all appearance a little before sunset. And if I\r\nask myself what will be the ultimate and final fruit of all our\r\nsocial reforms, garden cities, model employers, insurances, exchanges,\r\narbitration courts, and so on, then, I say, quite seriously, “I think it\r\nwill be labour under the lash.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sultan and the Sack\r\n\r\nLet us arrange in some order a number of converging considerations that\r\nall point in this direction. (1) It is broadly true, no doubt, that the\r\nweapon of the employer has hitherto been the threat of dismissal, that\r\nis, the threat of enforced starvation. He is a Sultan who need not order\r\nthe bastinado, so long as he can order the sack. But there are not a few\r\nsigns that this weapon is not quite so convenient and flexible a one\r\nas his increasing rapacities require. The fact of the introduction of\r\nfines, secretly or openly, in many shops and factories, proves that it\r\nis convenient for the capitalists to have some temporary and adjustable\r\nform of punishment besides the final punishment of pure ruin. Nor is it\r\ndifficult to see the commonsense of this from their wholly inhuman\r\npoint of view. The act of sacking a man is attended with the same\r\ndisadvantages as the act of shooting a man: one of which is that you can\r\nget no more out of him. It is, I am told, distinctly annoying to blow a\r\nfellow creature’s brains out with a revolver and then suddenly remember\r\nthat he was the only person who knew where to get the best Russian\r\ncigarettes. So our Sultan, who is the orderer of the sack, is also the\r\nbearer of the bow-string. A school in which there was no punishment,\r\nexcept expulsion, would be a school in which it would be very difficult\r\nto keep proper discipline; and the sort of discipline on which the\r\nreformed capitalism will insist will be all of the type which in free\r\nnations is imposed only on children. Such a school would probably be in\r\na chronic condition of breaking up for the holidays. And the reasons\r\nfor the insufficiency of this extreme instrument are also varied and\r\nevident. The materialistic Sociologists, who talk about the survival of\r\nthe fittest and the weakest going to the wall (and whose way of looking\r\nat the world is to put on the latest and most powerful scientific\r\nspectacles, and then shut their eyes), frequently talk as if a\r\nworkman were simply efficient or non-efficient, as if a criminal were\r\nreclaimable or irreclaimable. The employers have sense enough at least\r\nto know better than that. They can see that a servant may be useful in\r\none way and exasperating in another; that he may be bad in one part of\r\nhis work and good in another; that he may be occasionally drunk and yet\r\ngenerally indispensable. Just as a practical school-master would know\r\nthat a schoolboy can be at once the plague and the pride of the school.\r\nUnder these circumstances small and varying penalties are obviously the\r\nmost convenient things for the person keeping order; an underling can be\r\npunished for coming late, and yet do useful work when he comes. It will\r\nbe possible to give a rap over the knuckles without wholly cutting\r\noff the right hand that has offended. Under these circumstances the\r\nemployers have naturally resorted to fines. But there is a further\r\nground for believing that the process will go beyond fines before it is\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n(2) The fine is based on the old European idea that everybody possesses\r\nprivate property in some reasonable degree; but not only is this not\r\ntrue to-day, but it is not being made any truer, even by those who\r\nhonestly believe that they are mending matters. The great employers will\r\noften do something towards improving what they call the “conditions”\r\n of their workers; but a worker might have his conditions as carefully\r\narranged as a racehorse has, and still have no more personal property\r\nthan a racehorse. If you take an average poor seamstress or factory\r\ngirl, you will find that the power of chastising her through her\r\nproperty has very considerable limits; it is almost as hard for the\r\nemployer of labour to tax her for punishment as it is for the Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer to tax her for revenue. The next most obvious thing to\r\nthink of, of course, would be imprisonment, and that might be effective\r\nenough under simpler conditions. An old-fashioned shopkeeper might have\r\nlocked up his apprentice in his coal-cellar; but his coal-cellar would\r\nbe a real, pitch dark coal-cellar, and the rest of his house would be a\r\nreal human house. Everybody (especially the apprentice) would see a most\r\nperceptible difference between the two. But, as I pointed out in the\r\narticle before this, the whole tendency of the capitalist legislation\r\nand experiment is to make imprisonment much more general and automatic,\r\nwhile making it, or professing to make it, more humane. In other words,\r\nthe hygienic prison and the servile factory will become so uncommonly\r\nlike each other that the poor man will hardly know or care whether he\r\nis at the moment expiating an offence or merely swelling a dividend. In\r\nboth places there will be the same sort of shiny tiles. In neither place\r\nwill there be any cell so unwholesome as a coal-cellar or so wholesome\r\nas a home. The weapon of the prison, therefore, like the weapon of\r\nthe fine, will be found to have considerable limitations to its\r\neffectiveness when employed against the wretched reduced citizen of our\r\nday. Whether it be property or liberty you cannot take from him what he\r\nhas not got. You cannot imprison a slave, because you cannot enslave a\r\nslave.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Barbarous Revival\r\n\r\n(3) Most people, on hearing the suggestion that it may come to corporal\r\npunishment at last (as it did in every slave system I ever heard of,\r\nincluding some that were generally kindly, and even successful), will\r\nmerely be struck with horror and incredulity, and feel that such a\r\nbarbarous revival is unthinkable in the modern atmosphere. How far it\r\nwill be, or need be, a revival of the actual images and methods of\r\nruder times I will discuss in a moment. But first, as another of the\r\nconverging lines tending to corporal punishment, consider this: that for\r\nsome reason or other the old full-blooded and masculine humanitarianism\r\nin this matter has weakened and fallen silent; it has weakened and\r\nfallen silent in a very curious manner, the precise reason for which I\r\ndo not altogether understand. I knew the average Liberal, the average\r\nNonconformist minister, the average Labour Member, the average\r\nmiddle-class Socialist, were, with all their good qualities, very\r\ndeficient in what I consider a respect for the human soul. But I did\r\nimagine that they had the ordinary modern respect for the human body.\r\nThe fact, however, is clear and incontrovertible. In spite of the horror\r\nof all humane people, in spite of the hesitation even of our corrupt and\r\npanic-stricken Parliament, measures can now be triumphantly passed for\r\nspreading or increasing the use of physical torture, and for applying\r\nit to the newest and vaguest categories of crime. Thirty or forty years\r\nago, nay, twenty years ago, when Mr. F. Hugh O’Donnell and others forced\r\na Liberal Government to drop the cat-o-nine-tails like a scorpion, we\r\ncould have counted on a mass of honest hatred of such things. We cannot\r\ncount on it now.\r\n\r\n(4) But lastly, it is not necessary that in the factories of the future\r\nthe institution of physical punishment should actually remind people of\r\nthe jambok or the knout. It could easily be developed out of the many\r\nforms of physical discipline which are already used by employers on the\r\nexcuses of education or hygiene. Already in some factories girls are\r\nobliged to swim whether they like it or not, or do gymnastics whether\r\nthey like it or not. By a simple extension of hours or complication of\r\nexercises a pair of Swedish clubs could easily be so used as to leave\r\ntheir victim as exhausted as one who had come off the rack. I think it\r\nextremely likely that they will be.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. THE MASK OF SOCIALISM\r\n\r\nThe chief aim of all honest Socialists just now is to prevent the coming\r\nof Socialism. I do not say it as a sneer, but, on the contrary, as a\r\ncompliment; a compliment to their political instinct and public spirit.\r\nI admit it may be called an exaggeration; but there really is a sort of\r\nsham Socialism that the modern politicians may quite possibly agree to\r\nset up; if they do succeed in setting it up, the battle for the poor is\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nWe must note, first of all, a general truth about the curious time we\r\nlive in. It will not be so difficult as some people may suppose to make\r\nthe Servile State look rather like Socialism, especially to the more\r\npedantic kind of Socialist. The reason is this. The old lucid and\r\ntrenchant expounder of Socialism, such as Blatchford or Fred Henderson,\r\nalways describes the economic power of the plutocrats as consisting in\r\nprivate property. Of course, in a sense, this is quite true; though they\r\ntoo often miss the point that private property, as such, is not the same\r\nas property confined to the few. But the truth is that the situation has\r\ngrown much more subtle; perhaps too subtle, not to say too insane, for\r\nstraight-thinking theorists like Blatchford. The rich man to-day does\r\nnot only rule by using private property; he also rules by treating\r\npublic property as if it were private property. A man like Lord Murray\r\npulled the strings, especially the purse-strings; but the whole point of\r\nhis position was that all sorts of strings had got entangled. The secret\r\nstrength of the money he held did not lie merely in the fact that it was\r\nhis money. It lay precisely in the fact that nobody had any clear idea\r\nof whether it was his money, or his successor’s money, or his brother’s\r\nmoney, or the Marconi Company’s money, or the Liberal Party’s money,\r\nor the English Nation’s money. It was buried treasure; but it was not\r\nprivate property. It was the acme of plutocracy because it was not\r\nprivate property. Now, by following this precedent, this unprincipled\r\nvagueness about official and unofficial moneys by the cheerful habit of\r\nalways mixing up the money in the pocket with the money in the till, it\r\nwould be quite possible to keep the rich as rich as ever in practice,\r\nthough they might have suffered confiscation in theory. Mr. Lloyd George\r\nhas four hundred a year as an M. P.; but he not only gets much more as a\r\nMinister, but he might at any time get immeasurably more by speculating\r\non State secrets that are necessarily known to him. Some say that he has\r\neven attempted something of the kind. Now, it would be quite possible to\r\ncut Mr. George down, not to four hundred a year, but to fourpence a\r\nday; and still leave him all these other and enormous financial\r\nsuperiorities. It must be remembered that a Socialist State, in any way\r\nresembling a modern State, must, however egalitarian it may be, have the\r\nhandling of huge sums, and the enjoyment of large conveniences; it is\r\nnot improbable that the same men will handle and enjoy in much the same\r\nmanner, though in theory they are doing it as instruments, and not as\r\nindividuals. For instance, the Prime Minister has a private house, which\r\nis also (I grieve to inform that eminent Puritan) a public house. It\r\nis supposed to be a sort of Government office; though people do not\r\ngenerally give children’s parties, or go to bed in a Government office.\r\nI do not know where Mr. Herbert Samuel lives; but I have no doubt he\r\ndoes himself well in the matter of decoration and furniture. On the\r\nexisting official parallel there is no need to move any of these\r\nthings in order to Socialise them. There is no need to withdraw one\r\ndiamond-headed nail from the carpet; or one golden teaspoon from the\r\ntray. It is only necessary to call it an official residence, like\r\n10 Downing-street. I think it is not at all improbable that this\r\nPlutocracy, pretending to be a Bureaucracy, will be attempted or\r\nachieved. Our wealthy rulers will be in the position which grumblers\r\nin the world of sport sometimes attribute to some of the “gentlemen”\r\n players. They assert that some of these are paid like any professional;\r\nonly their pay is called their expenses. This system might run side by\r\nside with a theory of equal wages, as absolute as that once laid down by\r\nMr. Bernard Shaw. By the theory of the State, Mr. Herbert Samuel and Mr.\r\nLloyd George might be humble citizens, drudging for their fourpence\r\na day; and no better off than porters and coal-heavers. If there were\r\npresented to our mere senses what appeared to be the form of Mr. Herbert\r\nSamuel in an astrakhan coat and a motor-car, we should find the record\r\nof the expenditure (if we could find it at all) under the heading of\r\n“Speed Limit Extension Enquiry Commission.” If it fell to our lot to\r\nbehold (with the eye of flesh) what seemed to be Mr. Lloyd George\r\nlying in a hammock and smoking a costly cigar, we should know that the\r\nexpenditure would be divided between the “Condition of Rope and Netting\r\nInvestigation Department,” and the “State of Cuban Tobacco Trade:\r\nImperial Inspector’s Report.”\r\n\r\nSuch is the society I think they will build unless we can knock it down\r\nas fast as they build it. Everything in it, tolerable or intolerable,\r\nwill have but one use; and that use what our ancestors used to\r\ncall usance or usury. Its art may be good or bad, but it will be an\r\nadvertisement for usurers; its literature may be good or bad, but it\r\nwill appeal to the patronage of usurers; its scientific selection will\r\nselect according to the needs of usurers; its religion will be just\r\ncharitable enough to pardon usurers; its penal system will be just cruel\r\nenough to crush all the critics of usurers: the truth of it will be\r\nSlavery: and the title of it may quite possibly be Socialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ESCAPE\r\n\r\n     We watched you building, stone by stone,\r\n     The well-washed cells and well-washed graves\r\n     We shall inhabit but not own\r\n     When Britons ever shall be slaves;\r\n     The water’s waiting in the trough,\r\n     The tame oats sown are portioned free,\r\n     There is Enough, and just Enough,\r\n     And all is ready now but we.\r\n\r\n\r\n     But you have not caught us yet, my lords,\r\n     You have us still to get.\r\n     A sorry army you’d have got,\r\n     Its flags are rags that float and rot,\r\n     Its drums are empty pan and pot,\r\n     Its baggage is--an empty cot;\r\n     But you have not caught us yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n     A little; and we might have slipped\r\n     When came your rumours and your sales\r\n     And the foiled rich men, feeble-lipped,\r\n     Said and unsaid their sorry tales;\r\n     Great God!  It needs a bolder brow\r\n     To keep ten sheep inside a pen,\r\n     And we are sheep no longer now;\r\n     You are but Masters.  We are Men.\r\n\r\n\r\n     We give you all good thanks, my lords,\r\n     We buy at easy price;\r\n     Thanks for the thousands that you stole,\r\n     The bribes by wire, the bets on coal,\r\n     The knowledge of that naked whole\r\n     That hath delivered our flesh and soul\r\n     Out of your Paradise.\r\n\r\n\r\n     We had held safe your parks; but when\r\n     Men taunted you with bribe and fee,\r\n     We only saw the Lord of Men\r\n     Grin like an Ape and climb a tree;\r\n     And humbly had we stood without\r\n     Your princely barns; did we not see\r\n     In pointed faces peering out\r\n     What Rats now own the granary.\r\n\r\n\r\n     It is too late, too late, my lords,\r\n     We give you back your grace:\r\n     You cannot with all cajoling\r\n     Make the wet ditch, or winds that sting,\r\n     Lost pride, or the pawned wedding rings,\r\n     Or drink or Death a blacker thing\r\n     Than a smile upon your face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW RAID\r\n\r\nThe two kinds of social reform, one of which might conceivably free\r\nus at last while the other would certainly enslave us forever, are\r\nexhibited in an easy working model in the two efforts that have been\r\nmade for the soldiers’ wives--I mean the effort to increase their\r\nallowance and the effort to curtail their alleged drinking. In the\r\npreliminary consideration, at any rate, we must see the second question\r\nas quite detached from our own sympathies on the special subject of\r\nfermented liquor. It could be applied to any other pleasure or ornament\r\nof life; it will be applied to every other pleasure and ornament of life\r\nif the Capitalist campaign can succeed. The argument we know; but\r\nit cannot be too often made clear. An employer, let us say, pays a\r\nseamstress twopence a day, and she does not seem to thrive on it. So\r\nlittle, perhaps, does she thrive on it that the employer has even some\r\ndifficulty in thriving upon her. There are only two things that he can\r\ndo, and the distinction between them cuts the whole social and political\r\nworld in two. It is a touchstone by which we can--not sometimes, but\r\nalways--distinguish economic equality from servile social reform. He can\r\ngive the girl some magnificent sum, such as sixpence a day, to do as she\r\nlikes with, and trust that her improved health and temper will work for\r\nthe benefit of his business. Or he may keep her to the original sum of a\r\nshilling a week, but earmark each of the pennies to be used or not to\r\nbe used for a particular purpose. If she must not spend this penny on a\r\nbunch of violets, or that penny on a novelette, or the other penny on\r\na toy for some baby, it is possible that she will concentrate her\r\nexpenditure more upon physical necessities, and so become, from the\r\nemployer’s point of view, a more efficient person. Without the trouble\r\nof adding twopence to her wages, he has added twopenny-worth to her\r\nfood. In short, she has the holy satisfaction of being worth more\r\nwithout being paid more.\r\n\r\nThis Capitalist is an ingenious person, and has many polished\r\ncharacteristics; but I think the most singular thing about him is his\r\nstaggering lack of shame. Neither the hour of death nor the day of\r\nreckoning, neither the tent of exile nor the house of mourning, neither\r\nchivalry nor patriotism, neither womanhood nor widowhood, is safe at\r\nthis supreme moment from his dirty little expedient of dieting the\r\nslave. As similar bullies, when they collect the slum rents, put a\r\nfoot in the open door, these are always ready to push in a muddy wedge\r\nwherever there is a slit in a sundered household or a crack in a broken\r\nheart. To a man of any manhood nothing can be conceived more loathsome\r\nand sacrilegious than even so much as asking whether a woman who has\r\ngiven up all she loved to death and the fatherland has or has not shown\r\nsome weakness in her seeking for self-comfort. I know not in which of\r\nthe two cases I should count myself the baser for inquiring--a case\r\nwhere the charge was false or a case where it was true. But the\r\nphilanthropic employer of the sort I describe is not a man of any\r\nmanhood; in a sense he is not a man at all. He shows some consciousness\r\nof the fact when he calls his workers “men” as distinct from masters. He\r\ncannot comprehend the gallantry of costermongers or the delicacy that is\r\nquite common among cabmen. He finds this social reform by half-rations\r\non the whole to his mercantile profit, and it will be hard to get him to\r\nthink of anything else.\r\n\r\nBut there are people assisting him, people like the Duchess of\r\nMarlborough, who know not their right hand from their left, and to these\r\nwe may legitimately address our remonstrance and a resume of some of\r\nthe facts they do not know. The Duchess of Marlborough is, I believe,\r\nan American, and this separates her from the problem in a special way,\r\nbecause the drink question in America is entirely different from the\r\ndrink question in England. But I wish the Duchess of Marlborough would\r\npin up in her private study, side by side with the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, a document recording the following simple truths: (1)\r\nBeer, which is largely drunk in public-houses, is not a spirit or a grog\r\nor a cocktail or a drug. It is the common English liquid for quenching\r\nthe thirst; it is so still among innumerable gentlemen, and, until very\r\nlately, was so among innumerable ladies. Most of us remember dames of\r\nthe last generation whose manners were fit for Versailles, and who drank\r\nale or Stout as a matter of course. Schoolboys drank ale as a matter of\r\ncourse, and their schoolmasters gave it to them as a matter of course.\r\nTo tell a poor woman that she must not have any until half the day is\r\nover is simply cracked, like telling a dog or a child that he must\r\nnot have water. (2) The public-house is not a secret rendezvous of bad\r\ncharacters. It is the open and obvious place for a certain purpose,\r\nwhich all men used for that purpose until the rich began to be snobs\r\nand the poor to become slaves. One might as well warn people against\r\nWillesden Junction. (3) Many poor people live in houses where they\r\ncannot, without great preparation, offer hospitality. (4) The climate of\r\nthese picturesque islands does not favour conducting long conversations\r\nwith one’s oldest friends on an iron seat in the park. (5) Halfpast\r\neleven a.m. is not early in the day for a woman who gets up before six.\r\n(6) The bodies and minds of these women belong to God and to themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW NAME\r\n\r\nSomething has come into our community, which is strong enough to save\r\nour community; but which has not yet got a name. Let no one fancy I\r\nconfess any unreality when I confess the namelessness. The morality\r\ncalled Puritanism, the tendency called Liberalism, the reaction called\r\nTory Democracy, had not only long been powerful, but had practically\r\ndone most of their work, before these actual names were attached to\r\nthem. Nevertheless, I think it would be a good thing to have some\r\nportable and practicable way of referring to those who think as we do\r\nin our main concern. Which is, that men in England are ruled, at this\r\nminute by the clock, by brutes who refuse them bread, by liars who\r\nrefuse them news, and by fools who cannot govern, and therefore wish to\r\nenslave.\r\n\r\nLet me explain first why I am not satisfied with the word commonly used,\r\nwhich I have often used myself; and which, in some contexts, is quite\r\nthe right word to use. I mean the word “rebel.” Passing over the fact\r\nthat many who understand the justice of our cause (as a great many at\r\nthe Universities) would still use the word “rebel” in its old and strict\r\nsense as meaning only a disturber of just rule. I pass to a much more\r\npractical point. The word “rebel” understates our cause. It is much too\r\nmild; it lets our enemies off much too easily. There is a tradition in\r\nall western life and letters of Prometheus defying the stars, of man\r\nat war with the Universe, and dreaming what nature had never dared to\r\ndream. All this is valuable in its place and proportion. But it has\r\nnothing whatever to do with our ease; or rather it very much weakens it.\r\nThe plutocrats will be only too pleased if we profess to preach a new\r\nmorality; for they know jolly well that they have broken the old one.\r\nThey will be only too pleased to be able to say that we, by our own\r\nconfession, are merely restless and negative; that we are only what we\r\ncall rebels and they call cranks. But it is not true; and we must not\r\nconcede it to them for a moment. The model millionaire is more of a\r\ncrank than the Socialists; just as Nero was more of a crank than the\r\nChristians. And avarice has gone mad in the governing class to-day, just\r\nas lust went mad in the circle of Nero. By all the working and orthodox\r\nstandards of sanity, capitalism is insane. I should not say to Mr.\r\nRockefeller “I am a rebel.” I should say “I am a respectable man: and\r\nyou are not.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Lawless Enemies\r\n\r\nBut the vital point is that the confession of mere rebellion softens\r\nthe startling lawlessness of our enemies. Suppose a publisher’s clerk\r\npolitely asked his employer for a rise in his salary; and, on being\r\nrefused, said he must leave the employment? Suppose the employer knocked\r\nhim down with a ruler, tied him up as a brown paper parcel, addressed\r\nhim (in a fine business hand) to the Governor of Rio Janeiro and then\r\nasked the policeman to promise never to arrest him for what he had\r\ndone? That is a precise copy, in every legal and moral principle, of the\r\n“deportation of the strikers.” They were assaulted and kidnapped for not\r\naccepting a contract, and for nothing else; and the act was so avowedly\r\ncriminal that the law had to be altered afterwards to cover the crime.\r\nNow suppose some postal official, between here and Rio Janeiro, had\r\nnoticed a faint kicking inside the brown paper parcel, and had attempted\r\nto ascertain the cause. And suppose the clerk could only explain, in a\r\nmuffled voice through the brown paper, that he was by constitution and\r\ntemperament a Rebel. Don’t you see that he would be rather understating\r\nhis case? Don’t you see he would be bearing his injuries much too\r\nmeekly? They might take him out of the parcel; but they would very\r\npossibly put him into a mad-house instead. Symbolically speaking, that\r\nis what they would like to do with us. Symbolically speaking, the dirty\r\nmisers who rule us will put us in a mad-house--unless we can put them\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nOr suppose a bank cashier were admittedly allowed to take the money out\r\nof the till, and put it loose in his pocket, more or less mixed up with\r\nhis own money; afterwards laying some of both (at different odds) on\r\n“Blue Murder” for the Derby. Suppose when some depositor asked mildly\r\nwhat day the accountants came, he smote that astonished inquirer on the\r\nnose, crying: “Slanderer! Mud-slinger!” and suppose he then resigned his\r\nposition. Suppose no books were shown. Suppose when the new cashier came\r\nto be initiated into his duties, the old cashier did not tell him about\r\nthe money, but confided it to the honour and delicacy of his own maiden\r\naunt at Cricklewood. Suppose he then went off in a yacht to visit\r\nthe whale fisheries of the North Sea. Well, in every moral and legal\r\nprinciple, that is a precise account of the dealings with the Party\r\nFunds. But what would the banker say? What would the clients say? One\r\nthing, I think, I can venture to promise; the banker would not march up\r\nand down the office exclaiming in rapture, “I’m a rebel! That’s what I\r\nam, a rebel!” And if he said to the first indignant depositor “You are\r\na rebel,” I fear the depositor might answer, “You are a robber.” We have\r\nno need to elaborate arguments for breaking the law. The capitalists\r\nhave broken the law. We have no need of further moralities. They have\r\nbroken their own morality. It is as if you were to run down the street\r\nshouting, “Communism! Communism! Share! Share!” after a man who had run\r\naway with your watch.\r\n\r\nWe want a term that will tell everybody that there is, by the common\r\nstandard, frank fraud and cruelty pushed to their fierce extreme; and\r\nthat we are fighting THEM. We are not in a state of “divine discontent”;\r\nwe are in an entirely human and entirely reasonable rage. We say we have\r\nbeen swindled and oppressed, and we are quite ready and able to prove it\r\nbefore any tribunal that allows us to call a swindler a swindler. It is\r\nthe protection of the present system that most of its tribunals do not.\r\nI cannot at the moment think of any party name that would particularly\r\ndistinguish us from our more powerful and prosperous opponents, unless\r\nit were the name the old Jacobites gave themselves; the Honest Party.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptured Our Standards\r\n\r\nI think it is plain that for the purpose of facing these new and\r\ninfamous modern facts, we cannot, with any safety, depend on any of the\r\nold nineteenth century names; Socialist, or Communist, or Radical, or\r\nLiberal, or Labour. They are all honourable names; they all stand, or\r\nstood, for things in which we may still believe; we can still apply them\r\nto other problems; but not to this one. We have no longer a monopoly\r\nof these names. Let it be understood that I am not speaking here of the\r\nphilosophical problem of their meaning, but of the practical problem of\r\ntheir use. When I called myself a Radical I knew Mr. Balfour would not\r\ncall himself a Radical; therefore there was some use in the word. When\r\nI called myself a Socialist I knew Lord Penrhyn would not call himself\r\na Socialist; therefore there was some use in the word. But the\r\ncapitalists, in that aggressive march which is the main fact of our\r\ntime, have captured our standards, both in the military and philosophic\r\nsense of the word. And it is useless for us to march under colours which\r\nthey can carry as well as we.\r\n\r\nDo you believe in Democracy? The devils also believe and tremble. Do you\r\nbelieve in Trades Unionism? The Labour Members also believe; and tremble\r\nlike a falling teetotum. Do you believe in the State? The Samuels also\r\nbelieve, and grin. Do you believe in the centralisation of Empire? So\r\ndid Beit. Do you believe in the decentralisation of Empire? So does\r\nAlbu. Do you believe in the brotherhood of men: and do you, dear\r\nbrethren, believe that Brother Arthur Henderson does not? Do you cry,\r\n“The world for the workers!” and do you imagine Philip Snowden would\r\nnot? What we need is a name that shall declare, not that the modern\r\ntreason and tyranny are bad, but that they are quite literally,\r\nintolerable: and that we mean to act accordingly. I really think “the\r\nLimits” would be as good a name as any. But, anyhow, something is born\r\namong us that is as strong as an infant Hercules: and it is part of\r\nmy prejudices to want it christened. I advertise for godfathers and\r\ngodmothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA WORKMAN’S HISTORY OF ENGLAND\r\n\r\nA thing which does not exist and which is very much wanted is “A\r\nWorking-Man’s History of England.” I do not mean a history written\r\nfor working men (there are whole dustbins of them), I mean a history,\r\nwritten by working men or from the working men’s standpoint. I wish five\r\ngenerations of a fisher’s or a miner’s family could incarnate themselves\r\nin one man and tell the story.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to ignore altogether any comment coming from so eminent\r\na literary artist as Mr. Laurence Housman, but I do not deal here so\r\nspecially with his well known conviction about Votes for Women, as with\r\nanother idea which is, I think, rather at the back of it, if not with\r\nhim at least with others; and which concerns this matter of the true\r\nstory of England. For the true story is so entirely different from the\r\nfalse official story that the official classes tell that by this time\r\nthe working class itself has largely forgotten its own experience.\r\nEither story can be quite logically linked up with Female Suffrage,\r\nwhich, therefore, I leave where it is for the moment; merely confessing\r\nthat, so long as we get hold of the right story and not the wrong story,\r\nit seems to me a matter of secondary importance whether we link it up\r\nwith Female Suffrage or not.\r\n\r\nNow the ordinary version of recent English history that most moderately\r\neducated people have absorbed from childhood is something like this.\r\nThat we emerged slowly from a semi-barbarism in which all the power\r\nand wealth were in the hands of Kings and a few nobles; that the King’s\r\npower was broken first and then in due time that of the nobles, that\r\nthis piece-meal improvement was brought about by one class after\r\nanother waking up to a sense of citizenship and demanding a place in\r\nthe national councils, frequently by riot or violence; and that in\r\nconsequence of such menacing popular action, the franchise was granted\r\nto one class after another and used more and more to improve the social\r\nconditions of those classes, until we practically became a democracy,\r\nsave for such exceptions as that of the women. I do not think anyone\r\nwill deny that something like that is the general idea of the educated\r\nman who reads a newspaper and of the newspaper that he reads. That\r\nis the view current at public schools and colleges; it is part of the\r\nculture of all the classes that count for much in government; and there\r\nis not one word of truth in it from beginning to end.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Great Reform Bill\r\n\r\nWealth and political power were very much more popularly distributed\r\nin the Middle Ages than they are now; but we will pass all that and\r\nconsider recent history. The franchise has never been largely and\r\nliberally granted in England; half the males have no vote and are not\r\nlikely to get one. It was _never_ granted in reply to pressure from\r\nawakened sections of the democracy; in every case there was a perfectly\r\nclear motive for granting it solely for the convenience of the\r\naristocrats. The Great Reform Bill was not passed in response to such\r\nriots as that which destroyed a Castle; nor did the men who destroyed\r\nthe Castle get any advantage whatever out of the Great Reform Bill. The\r\nGreat Reform Bill was passed in order to seal an alliance between the\r\nlanded aristocrats and the rich manufacturers of the north (an alliance\r\nthat rules us still); and the chief object of that alliance was to\r\n_prevent_ the English populace getting any political power in the\r\ngeneral excitement after the French Revolution. No one can read\r\nMacaulay’s speech on the Chartists, for instance, and not see that this\r\nis so. Disraeli’s further extension of the suffrage was not effected\r\nby the intellectual vivacity and pure republican theory of the\r\nmid-Victorian agricultural labourer; it was effected by a politician\r\nwho saw an opportunity to dish the Whigs, and guessed that certain\r\northodoxies in the more prosperous artisan might yet give him a balance\r\nagainst the commercial Radicals. And while this very thin game of\r\nwire-pulling with the mere abstraction of the vote was being worked\r\nentirely by the oligarchs and entirely in their interests, the solid and\r\nreal thing that was going on was the steady despoiling of the poor\r\nof all power or wealth, until they find themselves to-day upon the\r\nthreshold of slavery. That is The Working Man’s History of England.\r\n\r\nNow, as I have said, I care comparatively little what is done with the\r\nmere voting part of the matter, so long as it is not claimed in such\r\na way as to allow the plutocrat to escape his responsibility for\r\nhis crimes, by pretending to be much more progressive, or much more\r\nsusceptible to popular protest, than he ever has been. And there is this\r\ndanger in many of those who have answered me. One of them, for\r\ninstance, says that women have been forced into their present industrial\r\nsituations by the same iron economic laws that have compelled men. I say\r\nthat men have not been compelled by iron economic laws, but in the main\r\nby the coarse and Christless cynicism of other men. But, of course,\r\nthis way of talking is exactly in accordance with the fashionable\r\nand official version of English history. Thus, you will read that the\r\nmonasteries, places where men of the poorest origin could be powerful,\r\ngrew corrupt and gradually decayed. Or you will read that the mediaeval\r\nguilds of free workmen yielded at last to an inevitable economic law.\r\nYou will read this; and you will be reading lies. They might as well say\r\nthat Julius Caesar gradually decayed at the foot of Pompey’s statue. You\r\nmight as well say that Abraham Lincoln yielded at last to an inevitable\r\neconomic law. The free mediaeval guilds did not decay; they were\r\nmurdered. Solid men with solid guns and halberds, armed with lawful\r\nwarrants from living statesmen broke up their corporations and took away\r\ntheir hard cash from them. In the same way the people in Cradley Heath\r\nare no more victims of a necessary economic law than the people in\r\nPutumayo. They are victims of a very terrible creature, of whose sins\r\nmuch has been said since the beginning of the world; and of whom it was\r\nsaid of old, “Let us fall into the hands of God, for His mercies are\r\ngreat; but let us not fall into the hands of Man.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Capitalist Is in the Dock\r\n\r\nNow it is this offering of a false economic excuse for the sweater that\r\nis the danger in perpetually saying that the poor woman will use the\r\nvote and that the poor man has not used it. The poor man is prevented\r\nfrom using it; prevented by the rich man, and the poor woman would be\r\nprevented in exactly the same gross and stringent style. I do not deny,\r\nof course, that there is something in the English temperament, and in\r\nthe heritage of the last few centuries that makes the English workman\r\nmore tolerant of wrong than most foreign workmen would be. But this only\r\nslightly modifies the main fact of the moral responsibility. To take an\r\nimperfect parallel, if we said that negro slaves would have rebelled\r\nif negroes had been more intelligent, we should be saying what is\r\nreasonable. But if we were to say that it could by any possibility be\r\nrepresented as being the negro’s fault that he was at that moment\r\nin America and not in Africa, we should be saying what is frankly\r\nunreasonable. It is every bit as unreasonable to say the mere supineness\r\nof the English workmen has put them in the capitalist slave-yard. The\r\ncapitalist has put them in the capitalist slaveyard; and very cunning\r\nsmiths have hammered the chains. It is just this creative criminality in\r\nthe authors of the system that we must not allow to be slurred over. The\r\ncapitalist is in the dock to-day; and so far as I at least can prevent\r\nhim, he shall not get out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE IRISH\r\n\r\nIt will be long before the poison of the Party System is worked out\r\nof the body politic. Some of its most indirect effects are the most\r\ndangerous. One that is very dangerous just now is this: that for most\r\nEnglishmen the Party System falsifies history, and especially the\r\nhistory of revolutions. It falsifies history because it simplifies\r\nhistory. It paints everything either Blue or Buff in the style of its\r\nown silly circus politics: while a real revolution has as many colours\r\nas the sunrise--or the end of the world. And if we do not get rid of\r\nthis error we shall make very bad blunders about the real revolution\r\nwhich seems to grow more and more probable, especially among the Irish.\r\nAnd any human familiarity with history will teach a man this first of\r\nall: that Party practically does not exist in a real revolution. It is a\r\ngame for quiet times.\r\n\r\nIf you take a boy who has been to one of those big private schools which\r\nare falsely called the Public Schools, and another boy who has been to\r\none of those large public schools which are falsely called the Board\r\nSchools, you will find some differences between the two, chiefly a\r\ndifference in the management of the voice. But you will find they\r\nare both English in a special way, and that their education has been\r\nessentially the same. They are ignorant on the same subjects. They have\r\nnever heard of the same plain facts. They have been taught the wrong\r\nanswer to the same confusing question. There is one fundamental element\r\nin the attitude of the Eton master talking about “playing the game,”\r\n and the elementary teacher training gutter-snipes to sing, “What is the\r\nMeaning of Empire Day?” And the name of that element is “unhistoric.” It\r\nknows nothing really about England, still less about Ireland or France,\r\nand, least of all, of course, about anything like the French Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nRevolution by Snap Division\r\n\r\nNow what general notion does the ordinary English boy, thus taught to\r\nutter one ignorance in one of two accents, get and keep through life\r\nabout the French Revolution? It is the notion of the English House of\r\nCommons with an enormous Radical majority on one side of the table and\r\na small Tory minority on the other; the majority voting solid for a\r\nRepublic, the minority voting solid for a Monarchy; two teams tramping\r\nthrough two lobbies with no difference between their methods and ours,\r\nexcept that (owing to some habit peculiar to Gaul) the brief intervals\r\nwere brightened by a riot or a massacre, instead of by a whisky and soda\r\nand a Marconi tip. Novels are much more reliable than histories in such\r\nmatters. For though an English novel about France does not tell the\r\ntruth about France, it does tell the truth about England; and more than\r\nhalf the histories never tell the truth about anything. And popular\r\nfiction, I think, bears witness to the general English impression. The\r\nFrench Revolution is a snap division with an unusual turnover of votes.\r\nOn the one side stand a king and queen who are good but weak, surrounded\r\nby nobles with rapiers drawn; some of whom are good, many of whom are\r\nwicked, all of whom are good-looking. Against these there is a formless\r\nmob of human beings, wearing red caps and seemingly insane, who all\r\nblindly follow ruffians who are also rhetoricians; some of whom die\r\nrepentant and others unrepentant towards the end of the fourth act.\r\nThe leaders of this boiling mass of all men melted into one are called\r\nMirabeau, Robespierre, Danton, Marat, and so on. And it is conceded that\r\ntheir united frenzy may have been forced on them by the evils of the old\r\nregime.\r\n\r\nThat, I think, is the commonest English view of the French Revolution;\r\nand it will not survive the reading of two pages of any real speech or\r\nletter of the period. These human beings were human; varied, complex and\r\ninconsistent. But the rich Englishman, ignorant of revolutions, would\r\nhardly believe you if you told him some of the common human subtleties\r\nof the case. Tell him that Robespierre threw the red cap in the dirt in\r\ndisgust, while the king had worn it with a broad grin, so to speak; tell\r\nhim that Danton, the fierce founder of the Republic of the Terror, said\r\nquite sincerely to a noble, “I am more monarchist than you;” tell him\r\nthat the Terror really seems to have been brought to an end chiefly by\r\nthe efforts of people who particularly wanted to go on with it--and he\r\nwill not believe these things. He will not believe them because he has\r\nno humility, and therefore no realism. He has never been inside himself;\r\nand so could never be inside another man. The truth is that in the\r\nFrench affair everybody occupied an individual position. Every man\r\ntalked sincerely, if not because he was sincere, then because he was\r\nangry. Robespierre talked even more about God than about the Republic\r\nbecause he cared even more about God than about the Republic. Danton\r\ntalked even more about France than about the Republic because he cared\r\neven more about France than about the Republic. Marat talked more about\r\nHumanity than either, because that physician (though himself somewhat\r\nneeding a physician) really cared about it. The nobles were divided,\r\neach man from the next. The attitude of the king was quite different\r\nfrom the attitude of the queen; certainly much more different than any\r\ndifferences between our Liberals and Tories for the last twenty years.\r\nAnd it will sadden _some_ of my friends to remember that it was the king\r\nwho was the Liberal and the queen who was the Tory. There were not two\r\npeople, I think, in that most practical crisis who stood in precisely\r\nthe same attitude towards the situation. And that is why, between them,\r\nthey saved Europe. It is when you really perceive the unity of mankind\r\nthat you really perceive its variety. It is not a flippancy, it is a\r\nvery sacred truth, to say that when men really understand that they are\r\nbrothers they instantly begin to fight.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Revival of Reality\r\n\r\nNow these things are repeating themselves with an enormous reality in\r\nthe Irish Revolution. You will not be able to make a Party System out of\r\nthe matter. Everybody is in revolt; therefore everybody is telling the\r\ntruth. The Nationalists will go on caring most for the nation, as Danton\r\nand the defenders of the frontier went on caring most for the nation.\r\nThe priests will go on caring most for religion, as Robespierre went on\r\ncaring most for religion. The Socialists will go on caring most for the\r\ncure of physical suffering, as Marat went on caring most for it. It is\r\nout of these real differences that real things can be made, such as the\r\nmodern French democracy. For by such tenacity everyone sees at last that\r\nthere is something in the other person’s position. And those drilled in\r\nparty discipline see nothing either past or present. And where there is\r\nnothing there is Satan.\r\n\r\nFor a long time past in our politics there has not only been no real\r\nbattle, but no real bargain. No two men have bargained as Gladstone and\r\nParnell bargained--each knowing the other to be a power. But in real\r\nrevolutions men discover that no one man can really agree with another\r\nman until he has disagreed with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBERALISM: A SAMPLE\r\n\r\nThere is a certain daily paper in England towards which I feel very much\r\nas Tom Pinch felt towards Mr. Pecksniff immediately after he had\r\nfound him out. The war upon Dickens was part of the general war on all\r\ndemocrats, about the eighties and nineties, which ushered in the brazen\r\nplutocracy of to-day. And one of the things that it was fashionable to\r\nsay of Dickens in drawing-rooms was that he had no subtlety, and could\r\nnot describe a complex frame of mind. Like most other things that are\r\nsaid in drawing-rooms, it was a lie. Dickens was a very unequal writer,\r\nand his successes alternate with his failures; but his successes\r\nare subtle quite as often as they are simple. Thus, to take “Martin\r\nChuzzlewit” alone, I should call the joke about the Lord No-zoo a simple\r\njoke: but I should call the joke about Mrs. Todgers’s vision of a wooden\r\nleg a subtle joke. And no frame of mind was ever so self-contradictory\r\nand yet so realistic as that which Dickens describes when he says, in\r\neffect, that, though Pinch knew now that there had never been such a\r\nperson as Pecksniff, in his ideal sense, he could not bring himself\r\nto insult the very face and form that had contained the legend. The\r\nparallel with Liberal journalism is not perfect; because it was once\r\nhonest; and Pecksniff presumably never was. And even when I come to feel\r\na final incompatibility of temper, Pecksniff was not so Pecksniffian as\r\nhe has since become. But the comparison is complete in so far as I share\r\nall the reluctance of Mr. Pinch. Some old heathen king was advised by\r\none of the Celtic saints, I think, to burn what he had adored and adore\r\nwhat he had burnt. I am quite ready, if anyone will prove I was wrong,\r\nto adore what I have burnt; but I do really feel an unwillingness\r\nverging upon weakness to burning what I have adored. I think it is a\r\nweakness to be overcome in times as bad as these, when (as Mr. Orage\r\nwrote with something like splendid common sense the other day) there is\r\nsuch a lot to do and so few people who will do it. So I will devote\r\nthis article to considering one case of the astounding baseness to which\r\nLiberal journalism has sunk.\r\n\r\n\r\nMental Breakdown in Fleet Street\r\n\r\nOne of the two or three streaks of light on our horizon can be perceived\r\nin this: that the moral breakdown of these papers has been accompanied\r\nby a mental breakdown also. The contemporary official paper, like the\r\n“Daily News” or the “Daily Chronicle” (I mean in so far as it deals with\r\npolitics), simply cannot argue; and simply does not pretend to argue. It\r\nconsiders the solution which it imagines that wealthy people want, and\r\nit signifies the same in the usual manner; which is not by holding\r\nup its hand, but by falling on its face. But there is no more curious\r\nquality in its degradation than a sort of carelessness, at once of\r\nhurry and fatigue, with which it flings down its argument--or rather its\r\nrefusal to argue. It does not even write sophistry: it writes anything.\r\nIt does not so much poison the reader’s mind as simply assume that the\r\nreader hasn’t got one. For instance, one of these papers printed an\r\narticle on Sir Stuart Samuel, who, having broken the great Liberal\r\nstatute against corruption, will actually, perhaps, be asked to pay his\r\nown fine--in spite of the fact that he can well afford to do so. The\r\narticle says, if I remember aright, that the decision will cause general\r\nsurprise and some indignation. That any modern Government making a very\r\nrich capitalist obey the law will cause general surprise, may be true.\r\nWhether it will cause general indignation rather depends on whether\r\nour social intercourse is entirely confined to Park Lane, or any such\r\npigsties built of gold. But the journalist proceeds to say, his neck\r\nrising higher and higher out of his collar, and his hair rising higher\r\nand higher on his head, in short, his resemblance to the Dickens’\r\noriginal increasing every instant, that he does not mean that the law\r\nagainst corruption should be less stringent, but that the burden should\r\nbe borne by the whole community. This may mean that whenever a rich man\r\nbreaks the law, all the poor men ought to be made to pay his fine. But\r\nI will suppose a slightly less insane meaning. I will suppose it means\r\nthat the whole power of the commonwealth should be used to prosecute an\r\noffender of this kind. That, of course, can only mean that the matter\r\nwill be decided by that instrument which still pretends to represent\r\nthe whole power of the commonwealth. In other words, the Government will\r\njudge the Government.\r\n\r\nNow this is a perfectly plain piece of brute logic. We need not go into\r\nthe other delicious things in the article, as when it says that “in old\r\ntimes Parliament had to be protected against Royal invasion by the man\r\nin the street.” Parliament has to be protected now against the man\r\nin the street. Parliament is simply the most detested and the most\r\ndetestable of all our national institutions: all that is evident enough.\r\nWhat is interesting is the blank and staring fallacy of the attempted\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Journalist Is Ruined\r\n\r\nA long while ago, before all the Liberals died, a Liberal introduced\r\na Bill to prevent Parliament being merely packed with the slaves of\r\nfinancial interests. For that purpose he established the excellent\r\ndemocratic principle that the private citizen, as such, might protest\r\nagainst public corruption. He was called the Common Informer. I\r\nbelieve the miserable party papers are really reduced to playing on the\r\ndegradation of the two words in modern language. Now the word “common”\r\n in “Common Informer” means exactly what it means in “common sense” or\r\n“Book of Common Prayer,” or (above all) in “House of Commons.” It\r\ndoes not mean anything low or vulgar; any more than they do. The only\r\ndifference is that the House of Commons really is low and vulgar; and\r\nthe Common Informer isn’t. It is just the same with the word “Informer.”\r\n It does not mean spy or sneak. It means one who gives information. It\r\nmeans what “journalist” ought to mean. The only difference is that the\r\nCommon Informer may be paid if he tells the truth. The common journalist\r\nwill be ruined if he does.\r\n\r\nNow the quite plain point before the party journalist is this: If\r\nhe really means that a corrupt bargain between a Government and a\r\ncontractor ought to be judged by public opinion, he must (nowadays) mean\r\nParliament; that is, the caucus that controls Parliament. And he must\r\ndecide between one of two views. Either he means that there can be no\r\nsuch thing as a corrupt Government. Or he means that it is one of the\r\ncharacteristic qualities of a corrupt Government to denounce its own\r\ncorruption. I laugh; and I leave him his choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FATIGUE OF FLEET STREET\r\n\r\nWhy is the modern party political journalism so bad? It is worse even\r\nthan it intends to be. It praises its preposterous party leaders through\r\nthick and thin; but it somehow succeeds in making them look greater\r\nfools than they are. This clumsiness clings even to the photographs\r\nof public men, as they are snapshotted at public meetings. A sensitive\r\npolitician (if there is such a thing) would, I should think, want to\r\nmurder the man who snapshots him at those moments. For our general\r\nimpression of a man’s gesture or play of feature is made up of a series\r\nof vanishing instants, at any one of which he may look worse than our\r\ngeneral impression records. Mr. Augustine Birrell may have made quite a\r\nsensible and amusing speech, in the course of which his audience would\r\nhardly have noticed that he resettled his necktie. Snapshot him, and\r\nhe appears as convulsively clutching his throat in the agonies of\r\nstrangulation, and with his head twisted on one side as if he had been\r\nhanged. Sir Edward Carson might make a perfectly good speech, which no\r\none thought wearisome, but might himself be just tired enough to shift\r\nfrom one leg to the other. Snapshot him, and he appears as holding one\r\nleg stiffly in the air and yawning enough to swallow the audience.\r\nBut it is in the prose narratives of the Press that we find most\r\nmanifestations of this strange ineptitude; this knack of exhibiting your\r\nown favourites in an unlucky light. It is not so much that the party\r\njournalists do not tell the truth as that they tell just enough of it\r\nto make it clear that they are telling lies. One of their favourite\r\nblunders is an amazing sort of bathos. They begin by telling you that\r\nsome statesman said something brilliant in style or biting in wit, at\r\nwhich his hearers thrilled with terror or thundered with applause. And\r\nthen they tell you what it was that he said. Silly asses!\r\n\r\n\r\nInsane Exaggeration\r\n\r\nHere is an example from a leading Liberal paper touching the debates on\r\nHome Rule. I am a Home Ruler; so my sympathies would be, if anything, on\r\nthe side of the Liberal paper upon that point. I merely quote it as\r\nan example of this ridiculous way of writing, which, by insane\r\nexaggeration, actually makes its hero look smaller than he is.\r\n\r\nThis was strange language to use about the “hypocritical sham,” and Mr.\r\nAsquith, knowing that the biggest battle of his career was upon him,\r\nhit back without mercy. “I should like first to know,” said he, with a\r\nglance at his supporters, “whether my proposals are accepted?”\r\n\r\nThat’s all. And I really do not see why poor Mr. Asquith should be\r\nrepresented as having violated the Christian virtue of mercy by saying\r\nthat. I myself could compose a great many paragraphs upon the same\r\nmodel, each containing its stinging and perhaps unscrupulous epigram.\r\nAs, for example:--“The Archbishop of Canterbury, realising that his\r\nchoice now lay between denying God and earning the crown of martyrdom by\r\ndying in torments, spoke with a frenzy of religious passion that might\r\nhave seemed fanatical under circumstances less intense. ‘The Children’s\r\nService,’ he said firmly, with his face to the congregation, ‘will be\r\nheld at half-past four this afternoon as usual.’”\r\n\r\nOr, we might have:--“Lord Roberts, recognising that he had now to face\r\nArmageddon, and that if he lost this last battle against overwhelming\r\nodds the independence of England would be extinguished forever,\r\naddressed to his soldiers (looking at them and not falling off his\r\nhorse) a speech which brought their national passions to boiling point,\r\nand might well have seemed blood-thirsty in quieter times. It ended with\r\nthe celebrated declaration that it was a fine day.”\r\n\r\nOr we might have the much greater excitement of reading something like\r\nthis:--“The Astronomer Royal, having realised that the earth would\r\ncertainly be smashed to pieces by a comet unless his requests in\r\nconnection with wireless telegraphy were seriously considered, gave an\r\naddress at the Royal Society which, under other circumstances, would\r\nhave seemed unduly dogmatic and emotional and deficient in scientific\r\nagnosticism. This address (which he delivered without any attempt to\r\nstand on his head) included a fierce and even ferocious declaration that\r\nit is generally easier to see the stars by night than by day.”\r\n\r\nNow, I cannot see, on my conscience and reason, that any one of my\r\nimaginary paragraphs is more ridiculous than the real one. Nobody can\r\nbelieve that Mr. Asquith regards these belated and careful compromises\r\nabout Home Rule as “the biggest battle of his career.” It is only\r\njustice to him to say that he has had bigger battles than that. Nobody\r\ncan believe that any body of men, bodily present, either thundered or\r\nthrilled at a man merely saying that he would like to know whether his\r\nproposals were accepted. No; it would be far better for Parliament if\r\nits doors were shut again, and reporters were excluded. In that case,\r\nthe outer public did hear genuine rumours of almost gigantic eloquence;\r\nsuch as that which has perpetuated Pitt’s reply against the charge of\r\nyouth, or Fox’s bludgeoning of the idea of war as a compromise. It would\r\nbe much better to follow the old fashion and let in no reporters at all\r\nthan to follow the new fashion and select the stupidest reporters you\r\ncan find.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir Load of Lies\r\n\r\nNow, why do people in Fleet-street talk such tosh? People in\r\nFleet-street are not fools. Most of them have realised reality through\r\nwork; some through starvation; some through damnation, or something\r\ndamnably like it. I think it is simply and seriously true that they\r\nare tired of their job. As the general said in M. Rostand’s play, “la\r\nfatigue!”\r\n\r\nI do really believe that this is one of the ways in which God (don’t get\r\nflurried, Nature if you like) is unexpectedly avenged on things infamous\r\nand unreasonable. And this method is that men’s moral and even physical\r\ntenacity actually give out under such a load of lies. They go on writing\r\ntheir leading articles and their Parliamentary reports. They go on doing\r\nit as a convict goes on picking oakum. But the point is not that we are\r\nbored with their articles; the point is that they are. The work is done\r\nworse because it is done weakly and without human enthusiasm. And it\r\nis done weakly because of the truth we have told so many times in this\r\nbook: that it is not done for monarchy, for which men will die; or for\r\ndemocracy, for which men will die; or even for aristocracy, for which\r\nmany men have died. It is done for a thing called Capitalism: which\r\nstands out quite clearly in history in many curious ways. But the most\r\ncurious thing about it is that no man has loved it; and no man died for\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AMNESTY FOR AGGRESSION\r\n\r\nIf there is to rise out of all this red ruin something like a republic\r\nof justice, it is essential that our views should be real views; that\r\nis, glimpses of lives and landscapes outside ourselves. It is essential\r\nthat they should not be mere opium visions that begin and end in\r\nsmoke--and so often in cannon smoke. I make no apology, therefore, for\r\nreturning to the purely practical and realistic point I urged last week:\r\nthe fact that we shall lose everything we might have gained if we lose\r\nthe idea that the responsible person is responsible.\r\n\r\nFor instance, it is almost specially so with the one or two things in\r\nwhich the British Government, or the British public, really are behaving\r\nbadly. The first, and worst of them, is the non-extension of the\r\nMoratorium, or truce of debtor and creditor, to the very world where\r\nthere are the poorest debtors and the cruellest creditors. This is\r\ninfamous: and should be, if possible, more infamous to those who think\r\nthe war right than to those who think it wrong. Everyone knows that\r\nthe people who can least pay their debts are the people who are always\r\ntrying to. Among the poor a payment may be as rash as a speculation.\r\nAmong the rich a bankruptcy may be as safe as a bank. Considering the\r\nclass from which private soldiers are taken, there is an atrocious\r\nmeanness in the idea of buying their blood abroad, while we sell their\r\nsticks at home. The English language, by the way, is full of delicate\r\nparadoxes. We talk of the private soldiers because they are really\r\npublic soldiers; and we talk of the public schools because they are\r\nreally private schools. Anyhow, the wrong is of the sort that ought to\r\nbe resisted, as much in war as in peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nOught to Be Hammered\r\n\r\nBut as long as we speak of it as a cloudy conclusion, come to by an\r\nanonymous club called Parliament, or a masked tribunal called the\r\nCabinet, we shall never get such a wrong righted. Somebody is officially\r\nresponsible for the unfairness; and that somebody ought to be hammered.\r\nThe other example, less important but more ludicrous, is the silly\r\nboycott of Germans in England, extending even to German music. I do\r\nnot believe for a moment that the English people feel any such insane\r\nfastidiousness. Are the English artists who practise the particularly\r\nEnglish art of water-colour to be forbidden to use Prussian blue? Are\r\nall old ladies to shoot their Pomeranian dogs? But though England would\r\nlaugh at this, she will get the credit of it, and will continue: until\r\nwe ask who the actual persons are who feel sure that we should shudder\r\nat a ballad of the Rhine. It is certain that we should find they\r\nare capitalists. It is very probable that we should find they are\r\nforeigners.\r\n\r\nSome days ago the Official Council of the Independent Labour Party, or\r\nthe Independent Council of the Official Labour Party, or the Independent\r\nand Official Council of the Labour Party (I have got quite nervous about\r\nthese names and distinctions; but they all seem to say the same thing)\r\nbegan their manifesto by saying it would be difficult to assign the\r\ndegrees of responsibility which each nation had for the outbreak of the\r\nwar. Afterwards, a writer in the “Christian Commonwealth,” lamenting\r\nwar in the name of Labour, but in the language of my own romantic\r\nmiddle-class, said that all the nations must share the responsibility\r\nfor this great calamity of war. Now exactly as long as we go on talking\r\nlike that we shall have war after war, and calamity after calamity,\r\nuntil the crack of doom. It simply amounts to a promise of pardon to\r\nany person who will start a quarrel. It is an amnesty for assassins. The\r\nmoment any man assaults any other man he makes all the other men as\r\nbad as himself. He has only to stab, and to vanish in a fog of\r\nforgetfulness. The real eagles of iron, the predatory Empires, will be\r\ndelighted with this doctrine. They will applaud the Labour Concert or\r\nCommittee, or whatever it is called. They will willingly take all the\r\ncrime, with only a quarter of the conscience: they will be as ready to\r\nshare the memory as they are to share the spoil. The Powers will divide\r\nresponsibility as calmly as they divided Poland.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Whole Loathsome Load\r\n\r\nBut I still stubbornly and meekly submit my point: that you cannot\r\nend war without asking who began it. If you think somebody else, not\r\nGermany, began it, then blame that somebody else: do not blame everybody\r\nand nobody. Perhaps you think that a small sovereign people, fresh from\r\ntwo triumphant wars, ought to discrown itself before sunrise; because\r\nthe nephew of a neighbouring Emperor has been shot by his own subjects.\r\nVery well. Then blame Servia; and, to the extent of your influence, you\r\nmay be preventing small kingdoms being obstinate or even princes being\r\nshot. Perhaps you think the whole thing was a huge conspiracy of Russia,\r\nwith France as a dupe and Servia as a pretext. Very well. Then blame\r\nRussia; and, to the extent of your influence, you may be preventing\r\ngreat Empires from making racial excuses for a raid. Perhaps you think\r\nFrance wrong for feeling what you call “revenge,” and I should\r\ncall recovery of stolen goods. Perhaps you blame Belgium for being\r\nsentimental about her frontier; or England for being sentimental about\r\nher word. If so, blame them; or whichever of them you think is to blame.\r\nOr again, it is barely possible that you may think, as I do, that the\r\nwhole loathsome load has been laid upon us by the monarchy which I have\r\nnot named; still less wasted time in abusing. But if there be in Europe\r\na military State which has not the religion of Russia, yet has helped\r\nRussia to tyrannise over the Poles, that State cares not for religion,\r\nbut for tyranny. If there be a State in Europe which has not the\r\nreligion of the Austrians, but has helped Austria to bully the Servians,\r\nthat State cares not for belief, but for bullying. If there be in\r\nEurope any people or principality which respects neither republics nor\r\nreligions, to which the political ideal of Paris is as much a myth as\r\nthe mystical ideal of Moscow, then blame that: and do more than blame.\r\nIn the healthy and highly theological words of Robert Blatchford, drive\r\nit back to the Hell from which it came.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrying Over Spilt Blood\r\n\r\nBut whatever you do, do not blame everybody for what was certainly done\r\nby somebody. It may be it is no good crying over spilt blood, any\r\nmore than over spilt milk. But we do not find the culprit any more by\r\nspilling the milk over everybody; or by daubing everybody with blood.\r\nStill less do we improve matters by watering the milk with our tears,\r\nnor the blood either. To say that everybody is responsible means that\r\nnobody is responsible. If in the future we see Russia annexing Rutland\r\n(as part of the old Kingdom of Muscovy), if we see Bavaria taking a\r\nsudden fancy to the Bank of England, or the King of the Cannibal Islands\r\nsuddenly demanding a tribute of edible boys and girls from England and\r\nAmerica, we may be quite certain also that the Leader of the Labour\r\nParty will rise, with a slight cough, and say: “It would be a difficult\r\ntask to apportion the blame between the various claims which...”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVIVE THE COURT JESTER\r\n\r\nI hope the Government will not think just now about appointing a Poet\r\nLaureate. I hardly think they can be altogether in the right mood. The\r\nbusiness just now before the country makes a very good detective story;\r\nbut as a national epic it is a little depressing. Jingo literature\r\nalways weakens a nation; but even healthy patriotic literature has\r\nits proper time and occasion. For instance, Mr. Newbolt (who has been\r\nsuggested for the post) is a very fine poet; but I think his patriotic\r\nlyrics would just now rather jar upon a patriot. We are rather too much\r\nconcerned about our practical seamanship to feel quite confident that\r\nDrake will return and “drum them up the Channel as he drummed them long\r\nago.” On the contrary, we have an uncomfortable feeling that Drake’s\r\nship might suddenly go to the bottom, because the capitalists have made\r\nLloyd George abolish the Plimsoll Line. One could not, without being\r\nunderstood ironically, adjure the two party teams to-day to “play up,\r\nplay up and play the game,” or to “love the game more than the\r\nprize.” And there is no national hero at this moment in the soldiering\r\nline--unless, perhaps, it is Major Archer-Shee--of whom anyone would\r\nbe likely to say: “Sed miles; sed pro patria.” There is, indeed, one\r\nbeautiful poem of Mr. Newbolt’s which may mingle faintly with one’s\r\nthoughts in such times, but that, alas, is to a very different tune. I\r\nmean that one in which he echoes Turner’s conception of the old wooden\r\nship vanishing with all the valiant memories of the English:\r\n\r\n\r\nThere’s a far bell ringing At the setting of the sun, And a phantom\r\nvoice is singing Of the great days done. There’s a far bell ringing, And\r\na phantom voice is singing Of a fame forever clinging To the great days\r\ndone. For the sunset breezes shiver, Temeraire, Temeraire, And she’s\r\nfading down the river....\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, well, neither you nor I know whether she is fading down the river\r\nor not. It is quite enough for us to know, as King Alfred did, that a\r\ngreat many pirates have landed on both banks of the Thames.\r\n\r\n\r\nPraise and Prophecy Impossible\r\n\r\nAt this moment that is the only kind of patriotic poem that could\r\nsatisfy the emotions of a patriotic person. But it certainly is not\r\nthe sort of poem that is expected from a Poet Laureate, either on\r\nthe highest or the lowest theory of his office. He is either a great\r\nminstrel singing the victories of a great king, or he is a common Court\r\nofficial like the Groom of the Powder Closet. In the first case his\r\npraises should be true; in the second case they will nearly always be\r\nfalse; but in either case he must praise. And what there is for him to\r\npraise just now it would be precious hard to say. And if there is no\r\ngreat hope of a real poet, there is still less hope of a real prophet.\r\nWhat Newman called, I think, “The Prophetical Office,” that is, the\r\ninstitution of an inspired protest even against an inspired religion,\r\ncertainly would not do in modern England. The Court is not likely to\r\nkeep a tame prophet in order to encourage him to be wild. It is not\r\nlikely to pay a man to say that wolves shall howl in Downing-street and\r\nvultures build their nests in Buckingham Palace. So vast has been the\r\nprogress of humanity that these two things are quite impossible. We\r\ncannot have a great poet praising kings. We cannot have a great prophet\r\ndenouncing kings. So I have to fall back on a third suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Field for a Fool\r\n\r\nInstead of reviving the Court Poet, why not revive the Court Fool? He is\r\nthe only person who could do any good at this moment either to the\r\nRoyal or the judicial Courts. The present political situation is utterly\r\nunsuitable for the purposes of a great poet. But it is particularly\r\nsuitable for the purposes of a great buffoon. The old jester was under\r\ncertain privileges: you could not resent the jokes of a fool, just\r\nas you cannot resent the sermons of a curate. Now, what the present\r\nGovernment of England wants is neither serious praise nor serious\r\ndenunciation; what it wants is satire. What it wants, in other words,\r\nis realism given with gusto. When King Louis the Eleventh unexpectedly\r\nvisited his enemy, the Duke of Burgundy, with a small escort, the Duke’s\r\njester said he would give the King his fool’s cap, for he was the fool\r\nnow. And when the Duke replied with dignity, “And suppose I treat him\r\nwith all proper respect?” the fool answered, “Then I will give it to\r\nyou.” That is the kind of thing that somebody ought to be free to say\r\nnow. But if you say it now you will be fined a hundred pounds at the\r\nleast.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarson’s Dilemma\r\n\r\nFor the things that have been happening lately are not merely things\r\nthat one could joke about. They are themselves, truly and intrinsically,\r\njokes. I mean that there is a sort of epigram of unreason in the\r\nsituation itself, as there was in the situation where there was jam\r\nyesterday and jam to-morrow but never jam to-day. Take, for instance,\r\nthe extraordinary case of Sir Edward Carson. The point is not whether we\r\nregard his attitude in Belfast as the defiance of a sincere and dogmatic\r\nrebel, or as the bluff of a party hack and mountebank. The point is not\r\nwhether we regard his defence of the Government at the Old Bailey as a\r\nchivalrous and reluctant duty done as an advocate or a friend, or as\r\na mere case of a lawyer selling his soul for a fat brief. The point is\r\nthat whichever of the two actions we approve, and whichever of the four\r\nexplanations we adopt, Sir Edward’s position is still raving nonsense.\r\nOn any argument, he cannot escape from his dilemma. It may be argued\r\nthat laws and customs should be obeyed whatever our private feelings;\r\nand that it is an established custom to accept a brief in such a case.\r\nBut then it is a somewhat more established custom to obey an Act\r\nof Parliament and to keep the peace. It may be argued that extreme\r\nmisgovernment justifies men in Ulster or elsewhere in refusing to obey\r\nthe law. But then it would justify them even more in refusing to\r\nappear professionally in a law court. Etiquette cannot be at once so\r\nunimportant that Carson may shoot at the King’s uniform, and yet so\r\nimportant that he must always be ready to put on his own. The Government\r\ncannot be so disreputable that Carson need not lay down his gun, and yet\r\nso respectable that he is bound to put on his wig. Carson cannot at once\r\nbe so fierce that he can kill in what he considers a good cause, and yet\r\nso meek that he must argue in what he considers a bad cause. Obedience\r\nor disobedience, conventional or unconventional, a solicitor’s letter\r\ncannot be more sacred than the King’s writ; a blue bag cannot be more\r\nrational than the British flag. The thing is rubbish read anyway, and\r\nthe only difficulty is to get a joke good enough to express it. It is a\r\ncase for the Court Jester. The phantasy of it could only be expressed by\r\nsome huge ceremonial hoax. Carson ought to be crowned with the shamrocks\r\nand emeralds and followed by green-clad minstrels of the Clan-na-Gael,\r\nplaying “The Wearing of the Green.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBelated Chattiness by Wireless\r\n\r\nBut all the recent events are like that. They are practical jokes. The\r\njokes do not need to be made: they only need to be pointed out. You and\r\nI do not talk and act as the Isaacs brothers talked and acted, by their\r\nown most favourable account of themselves; and even their account of\r\nthemselves was by no means favourable. You and I do not talk of\r\nmeeting our own born brother “at a family function” as if he were some\r\ninfinitely distant cousin whom we only met at Christmas. You and I, when\r\nwe suddenly feel inclined for a chat with the same brother about his\r\ndinner and the Coal Strike, do not generally select either wireless\r\ntelegraphy or the Atlantic Cable as the most obvious and economical\r\nchannel for that outburst of belated chattiness. You and I do not talk,\r\nif it is proposed to start a railway between Catsville and Dogtown, as\r\nif the putting up of a station at Dogtown could have no kind of economic\r\neffect on the putting up of a station at Catsville. You and I do not\r\nthink it candid to say that when we are at one end of a telephone we\r\nhave no sort of connection with the other end. These things have got\r\ninto the region of farce; and should be dealt with farcically, not even\r\nferociously.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Fool Who Shall Be Free\r\n\r\nIn the Roman Republic there was a Tribune of the People, whose person\r\nwas inviolable like an ambassador’s. There was much the same idea\r\nin Becket’s attempt to remove the Priest, who was then the popular\r\nchampion, from the ordinary courts. We shall have no Tribune; for we\r\nhave no republic. We shall have no Priest; for we have no religion. The\r\nbest we deserve or can expect is a Fool who shall be free; and who shall\r\ndeliver us with laughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ART OF MISSING THE POINT\r\n\r\nMissing the point is a very fine art; and has been carried to something\r\nlike perfection by politicians and Pressmen to-day. For the point is\r\ngenerally a very sharp point; and is, moreover, sharp at both ends.\r\nThat is to say that both parties would probably impale themselves in an\r\nuncomfortable manner if they did not manage to avoid it altogether. I\r\nhave just been looking at the election address of the official Liberal\r\ncandidate for the part of the country in which I live; and though it\r\nis, if anything, rather more logical and free from cant than most other\r\ndocuments of the sort it is an excellent example of missing the point.\r\nThe candidate has to go boring on about Free Trade and Land Reform and\r\nEducation; and nobody reading it could possibly imagine that in the town\r\nof Wycombe, where the poll will be declared, the capital of the Wycombe\r\ndivision of Bucks which the candidate is contesting, centre of the\r\nimportant and vital trade on which it has thriven, a savage struggle\r\nabout justice has been raging for months past between the poor and rich,\r\nas real as the French Revolution. The man offering himself at Wycombe as\r\nrepresentative of the Wycombe division simply says nothing about it at\r\nall. It is as if a man at the crisis of the French Terror had offered\r\nhimself as a deputy for the town of Paris, and had said nothing about\r\nthe Monarchy, nothing about the Republic, nothing about the massacres,\r\nnothing about the war; but had explained with great clearness his views\r\non the suppression of the Jansenists, the literary style of Racine,\r\nthe suitability of Turenae for the post of commander-in-chief, and the\r\nreligious reflections of Madame de Maintenon. For, at their best, the\r\ncandidate’s topics are not topical. Home Rule is a very good thing, and\r\nmodern education is a very bad thing; but neither of them are things\r\nthat anybody is talking about in High Wycombe. This is the first and\r\nsimplest way of missing the point: deliberately to avoid and ignore it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Candid Candidate\r\n\r\nIt would be an amusing experiment, by the way, to go to the point\r\ninstead of avoiding it. What fun it would be to stand as a strict Party\r\ncandidate, but issue a perfectly frank and cynical Election Address.\r\nMr. Mosley’s address begins, “Gentlemen,--Sir Alfred Cripps having been\r\nchosen for a high judicial position and a seat in the House of Lords, a\r\nby-election now becomes necessary, and the electors of South Bucks are\r\ncharged with the responsible duty of electing, etc., etc.” But suppose\r\nthere were another candidate whose election address opened in a plain,\r\nmanly style, like this: “Gentlemen,--In the sincere hope of being myself\r\nchosen for a high judicial position or a seat in the House of Lords,\r\nor considerably increasing my private fortune by some Government\r\nappointment, or, at least, inside information about the financial\r\nprospects, I have decided that it is worth my while to disburse large\r\nsums of money to you on various pretexts, and, with even more reluctance\r\nto endure the bad speaking and bad ventilation of the Commons’ House\r\nof Parliament, so help me God. I have very pronounced convictions on\r\nvarious political questions; but I will not trouble my fellow-citizens\r\nwith them, since I have quite made up my mind to abandon any or all\r\nof them if requested to do so by the upper classes. The electors are\r\ntherefore charged with the entirely irresponsible duty of electing a\r\nMember; or, in other words, I ask my neighbours round about this part,\r\nwho know I am not a bad chap in many ways, to do me a good turn in my\r\nbusiness, just as I might ask them to change a sovereign. My election\r\nwill have no conceivable kind of effect on anything or anybody except\r\nmyself; so I ask, as man to man, the Electors of the Southern or Wycombe\r\nDivision of the County of Buckingham to accept a ride in one of my\r\nmotor-cars; and poll early to please a pal--God Save the King.” I do not\r\nknow whether you or I would be elected if we presented ourselves with\r\nan election address of that kind; but we should have had our fun and\r\n(comparatively speaking) saved our souls; and I have a strong suspicion\r\nthat we should be elected or rejected on a mechanical majority like\r\nanybody else; nobody having dreamed of reading an election address any\r\nmore than an advertisement of a hair restorer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTyranny and Head-Dress\r\n\r\nBut there is another and more subtle way in which we may miss the point;\r\nand that is, not by keeping a dead silence about it, but by being just\r\nwitty enough to state it wrong. Thus, some of the Liberal official\r\npapers have almost screwed up their courage to the sticking-point about\r\nthe bestial coup d’etat in South Africa. They have screwed up their\r\ncourage to the sticking-point; and it has stuck. It cannot get any\r\nfurther; because it has missed the main point. The modern Liberals make\r\ntheir feeble attempts to attack the introduction of slavery into South\r\nAfrica by the Dutch and the Jews, by a very typical evasion of the vital\r\nfact. The vital fact is simply slavery. Most of these Dutchmen have\r\nalways felt like slave-owners. Most of these Jews have always felt like\r\nslaves. Now that they are on top, they have a particular and curious\r\nkind of impudence, which is only known among slaves. But the Liberal\r\njournalists will do their best to suggest that the South African\r\nwrong consisted in what they call Martial Law. That is, that there is\r\nsomething specially wicked about men doing an act of cruelty in khaki\r\nor in vermilion, but not if it is done in dark blue with pewter buttons.\r\nThe tyrant who wears a busby or a forage cap is abominable; the tyrant\r\nwho wears a horsehair wig is excusable. To be judged by soldiers is\r\nhell; but to be judged by lawyers is paradise.\r\n\r\nNow the point must not be missed in this way. What is wrong with the\r\ntyranny in Africa is not that it is run by soldiers. It would be quite\r\nas bad, or worse, if it were run by policemen. What is wrong is that,\r\nfor the first time since Pagan times, private men are being forced to\r\nwork for a private man. Men are being punished by imprisonment or exile\r\nfor refusing to accept a job. The fact that Botha can ride on a horse,\r\nor fire off a gun, makes him better rather than worse than any man like\r\nSidney Webb or Philip Snowden, who attempt the same slavery by much less\r\nmanly methods. The Liberal Party will try to divert the whole discussion\r\nto one about what they call militarism. But the very terms of modern\r\npolitics contradict it. For when we talk of real rebels against the\r\npresent system we call them Militants. And there will be none in the\r\nServile State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SERVILE STATE AGAIN\r\n\r\nI read the other day, in a quotation from a German newspaper, the highly\r\ncharacteristic remark that Germany having annexed Belgium would soon\r\nre-establish its commerce and prosperity, and that, in particular,\r\narrangements were already being made for introducing into the new\r\nprovince the German laws for the protection of workmen.\r\n\r\nI am quite content with that paragraph for the purpose of any\r\ncontroversy about what is called German atrocity. If men I know had not\r\ntold me they had themselves seen the bayoneting of a baby; if the\r\nmost respectable refugees did not bring with them stories of burning\r\ncottages--yes, and of burning cottagers as well; if doctors did not\r\nreport what they do report of the condition of girls in the hospitals;\r\nif there were no facts; if there were no photographs, that one phrase I\r\nhave quoted would be quite sufficient to satisfy me that the Prussians\r\nare tyrants; tyrants in a peculiar and almost insane sense which makes\r\nthem pre-eminent among the evil princes of the earth. The first and\r\nmost striking feature is a stupidity that rises into a sort of ghastly\r\ninnocence. The protection of workmen! Some workmen, perhaps, might have\r\na fancy for being protected from shrapnel; some might be glad to put up\r\nan umbrella that would ward off things dropping from the gentle\r\nZeppelin in heaven upon the place beneath. Some of these discontented\r\nproletarians have taken the same view as Vandervelde their leader, and\r\nare now energetically engaged in protecting themselves along the line\r\nof the Yser; I am glad to say not altogether without success. It is\r\nprobable that nearly all of the Belgian workers would, on the\r\nwhole, prefer to be protected against bombs, sabres, burning cities,\r\nstarvation, torture, and the treason of wicked kings. In short, it is\r\nprobable--it is at least possible, impious as is the idea--that they\r\nwould prefer to be protected against Germans and all they represent.\r\nBut if a Belgian workman is told that he is not to be protected against\r\nGermans, but actually to be protected by Germans, I think he may be\r\nexcused for staring. His first impulse, I imagine, will be to ask,\r\n“Against whom? Are there any worse people to come along?”\r\n\r\nBut apart from the hellish irony of this humanitarian idea, the question\r\nit raises is really one of solid importance for people whose politics\r\nare more or less like ours. There is a very urgent point in that\r\nquestion, “Against whom would the Belgian workmen be protected by\r\nthe German laws?” And if we pursue it, we shall be enabled to analyse\r\nsomething of that poison--very largely a Prussian poison--which has long\r\nbeen working in our own commonwealth, to the enslavement of the weak\r\nand the secret strengthening of the strong. For the Prussian armies\r\nare, pre-eminently, the advance guard of the Servile State. I say this\r\nscientifically, and quite apart from passion or even from preference.\r\nI have no illusions about either Belgium or England. Both have been\r\nstained with the soot of Capitalism and blinded with the smoke of mere\r\nColonial ambition; both have been caught at a disadvantage in such\r\nmodern dirt and disorder; both have come out much better than I should\r\nhave expected countries so modern and so industrial to do. But in\r\nEngland and Belgium there is Capitalism mixed up with a great many other\r\nthings, strong things and things that pursue other aims; Clericalism,\r\nfor instance, and militant Socialism in Belgium; Trades Unionism and\r\nsport and the remains of real aristocracy in England. But Prussia is\r\nCapitalism; that is, a gradually solidifying slavery; and that majestic\r\nunity with which she moves, dragging all the dumb Germanies after her,\r\nis due to the fact that her Servile State is complete, while ours is\r\nincomplete. There are not mutinies; there are not even mockeries; the\r\nvoice of national self-criticism has been extinguished forever. For this\r\npeople is already permanently cloven into a higher and a lower class:\r\nin its industry as much as its army. Its employers are, in the strictest\r\nand most sinister sense, captains of industry. Its proletariat is,\r\nin the truest and most pitiable sense, an army of labour. In that\r\natmosphere masters bear upon them the signs that they are more than men;\r\nand to insult an officer is death.\r\n\r\nIf anyone ask how this extreme and unmistakable subordination of the\r\nemployed to the employers is brought about, we all know the answer.\r\nIt is brought about by hunger and hardness of heart, accelerated by a\r\ncertain kind of legislation, of which we have had a good deal lately\r\nin England, but which was almost invariably borrowed from Prussia. Mr.\r\nHerbert Samuel’s suggestion that the poor should be able to put their\r\nmoney in little boxes and not be able to get it out again is a sort\r\nof standing symbol of all the rest. I have forgotten how the poor were\r\ngoing to benefit eventually by what is for them indistinguishable from\r\ndropping sixpence down a drain. Perhaps they were going to get it back\r\nsome day; perhaps when they could produce a hundred coupons out of the\r\nDaily Citizen; perhaps when they got their hair cut; perhaps when they\r\nconsented to be inoculated, or trepanned, or circumcised, or something.\r\nGermany is full of this sort of legislation; and if you asked an\r\ninnocent German, who honestly believed in it, what it was, he would\r\nanswer that it was for the protection of workmen.\r\n\r\nAnd if you asked again “Their protection from what?” you would have\r\nthe whole plan and problem of the Servile State plain in front of you.\r\nWhatever notion there is, there is no notion whatever of protecting the\r\nemployed person _from his employer_. Much less is there any idea of his\r\never being anywhere except under an employer. Whatever the Capitalist\r\nwants he gets. He may have the sense to want washed and well-fed\r\nlabourers rather than dirty and feeble ones, and the restrictions may\r\nhappen to exist in the form of laws from the Kaiser or by-laws from the\r\nKrupps. But the Kaiser will not offend the Krupps, and the Krupps\r\nwill not offend the Kaiser. Laws of this kind, then, do not attempt to\r\nprotect workmen against the injustice of the Capitalist as the English\r\nTrade Unions did. They do not attempt to protect workmen against the\r\ninjustice of the State as the mediaeval guilds did. Obviously they\r\ncannot protect workmen against the foreign invader--especially when (as\r\nin the comic case of Belgium) they are imposed by the foreign invader.\r\nWhat then are such laws designed to protect workmen against? Tigers,\r\nrattlesnakes, hyenas?\r\n\r\nOh, my young friends; oh, my Christian brethren, they are designed to\r\nprotect this poor person from something which to those of established\r\nrank is more horrid than many hyenas. They are designed, my friends, to\r\nprotect a man from himself--from something that the masters of the earth\r\nfear more than famine or war, and which Prussia especially fears as\r\neverything fears that which would certainly be its end. They are meant\r\nto protect a man against himself--that is, they are meant to protect a\r\nman against his manhood.\r\n\r\nAnd if anyone reminds me that there is a Socialist Party in Germany, I\r\nreply that there isn’t.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EMPIRE OF THE IGNORANT\r\n\r\nThat anarchic future which the more timid Tories professed to fear has\r\nalready fallen upon us. We are ruled by ignorant people. But the most\r\nignorant people in modern Britain are to be found in the upper class,\r\nthe middle class, and especially the upper middle class. I do not say\r\nit with the smallest petulance or even distaste; these classes are\r\noften really beneficent in their breeding or their hospitality, or their\r\nhumanity to animals.\r\n\r\nThere is still no better company than the young at the two Universities,\r\nor the best of the old in the Army or some of the other services. Also,\r\nof course, there are exceptions in the matter of learning; real scholars\r\nlike Professor Gilbert Murray or Professor Phillimore are not ignorant,\r\nthough they _are_ gentlemen. But when one looks up at any mass of the\r\nwealthier and more powerful classes, at the Grand Stand at Epsom, at\r\nthe windows of Park-lane, at the people at a full-dress debate or a\r\nfashionable wedding, we shall be safe in saying that they are, for the\r\nmost part, the most ill-taught, or untaught, creatures in these islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiterally Illiterate\r\n\r\nIt is indeed their feeble boast that they are not literally illiterate.\r\nThey are always saying the ancient barons could not sign their own\r\nnames--for they know less of history perhaps than of anything else. The\r\nmodern barons, however, can sign their own names--or someone else’s for\r\na change. They can sign their own names; and that is about all they can\r\ndo. They cannot face a fact, or follow an argument, or feel a tradition;\r\nbut, least of all, can they, upon any persuasion, read through a plain\r\nimpartial book, English or foreign, that is not specially written to\r\nsoothe their panic or to please their pride. Looking up at these seats\r\nof the mighty I can only say, with something of despair, what Robert\r\nLowe said of the enfranchised workmen: “We must educate our masters.”\r\n\r\nI do not mean this as paradoxical, or even as symbolical; it is simply\r\ntame and true. The modern English rich know nothing about things, not\r\neven about the things to which they appeal. Compared with them, the\r\npoor are pretty sure to get some enlightenment, even if they cannot get\r\nliberty; they must at least be technical. An old apprentice learnt\r\na trade, even if his master came like any Turk and banged him most\r\nseverely. The old housewife knew which side her bread was buttered, even\r\nif it were so thin as to be almost imperceptible. The old sailor knew\r\nthe ropes; even if he knew the rope’s end. Consequently, when any\r\nof these revolted, they were concerned with things they knew, pains,\r\npractical impossibilities, or the personal record.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut They Know\r\n\r\nThe apprentice cried “Clubs?” and cracked his neighbours’ heads with\r\nthe precision and fineness of touch which only manual craftsmanship can\r\ngive. The housewives who flatly refused to cook the hot dinner knew how\r\nmuch or how little, cold meat there was in the house. The sailor who\r\ndefied discipline by mutinying at the Nore did not defy discipline in\r\nthe sense of falling off the rigging or letting the water into the hold.\r\nSimilarly the modern proletariat, however little it may know, knows what\r\nit is talking about.\r\n\r\nBut the curious thing about the educated class is that exactly what it\r\ndoes not know is what it is talking about. I mean that it is startlingly\r\nignorant of those special things which it is supposed to invoke and keep\r\ninviolate. The things that workmen invoke may be uglier, more acrid,\r\nmore sordid; but they know all about them. They know enough arithmetic\r\nto know that prices have risen; the kind Levantine gentleman is always\r\nthere to make them fully understand the meaning of an interest sum; and\r\nthe landlord will define Rent as rigidly as Ricardo. The doctors can\r\nalways tell them the Latin for an empty stomach; and when the poor man\r\nis treated for the time with some human respect (by the Coronet) it\r\nalmost seems a pity he is not alive to hear how legally he died.\r\n\r\nAgainst this bitter shrewdness and bleak realism in the suffering\r\nclasses it is commonly supposed that the more leisured classes stand for\r\ncertain legitimate ideas which also have their place in life; such as\r\nhistory, reverence, the love of the land. Well, it might be no bad thing\r\nto have something, even if it were something narrow, that testified to\r\nthe truths of religion or patriotism. But such narrow things in the\r\npast have always at least known their own history; the bigot knew his\r\ncatechism; the patriot knew his way home. The astonishing thing about\r\nthe modern rich is their real and sincere ignorance--especially of the\r\nthings they like.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo!\r\n\r\nTake the most topical case you can find in any drawing-room: Belfast.\r\nUlster is most assuredly a matter of history; and there is a sense in\r\nwhich Orange resistance is a matter of religion. But go and ask any of\r\nthe five hundred fluttering ladies at a garden party (who find Carson so\r\nsplendid and Belfast so thrilling) what it is all about, when it began,\r\nwhere it came from, what it really maintains? What was the history\r\nof Ulster? What is the religion of Belfast? Do any of them know where\r\nUlstermen were in Grattan’s time; do any of them know what was the\r\n“Protestantism” that came from Scotland to that isle; could any of them\r\ntell what part of the old Catholic system it really denied?\r\n\r\nIt was generally something that the fluttering ladies find in their own\r\nAnglican churches every Sunday. It were vain to ask them to state the\r\ndoctrines of the Calvinist creed; they could not state the doctrines\r\nof their own creed. It were vain to tell them to read the history of\r\nIreland; they have never read the history of England. It would matter as\r\nlittle that they do not know these things, as that I do not know German;\r\nbut then German is not the only thing I am supposed to know. History and\r\nritual are the only things aristocrats are supposed to know; and they\r\ndon’t know them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmile and Smile\r\n\r\nI am not fed on turtle soup and Tokay because of my exquisite intimacy\r\nwith the style and idiom of Heine and Richter. The English governing\r\nclass is fed on turtle soup and Tokay to represent the past, of which\r\nit is literally ignorant, as I am of German irregular verbs; and to\r\nrepresent the religious traditions of the State, when it does not know\r\nthree words of theology, as I do not know three words of German.\r\n\r\nThis is the last insult offered by the proud to the humble. They rule\r\nthem by the smiling terror of an ancient secret. They smile and smile;\r\nbut they have forgotten the secret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SYMBOLISM OF KRUPP\r\n\r\nThe curious position of the Krupp firm in the awful story developing\r\naround us is not quite sufficiently grasped. There is a kind of academic\r\nclarity of definition which does not see the proportions of things for\r\nwhich everything falls within a definition, and nothing ever breaks\r\nbeyond it. To this type of mind (which is valuable when set to its\r\nspecial and narrow work) there is no such thing as an exception that\r\nproves the rule. If I vote for confiscating some usurer’s millions I am\r\ndoing, they say, precisely what I should be doing if I took pennies out\r\nof a blind man’s hat. They are both denials of the principle of private\r\nproperty, and are equally right and equally wrong, according to our view\r\nof that principle. I should find a great many distinctions to draw\r\nin such a matter. First, I should say that taking a usurer’s money by\r\nproper authority is not robbery, but recovery of stolen goods. Second,\r\nI should say that even if there were no such thing as personal property,\r\nthere would still be such a thing as personal dignity, and different\r\nmodes of robbery would diminish it in very different ways. Similarly,\r\nthere is a truth, but only a half-truth, in the saying that all modern\r\nPowers alike rely on the Capitalist and make war on the lines of\r\nCapitalism. It is true, and it is disgraceful. But it is _not_ equally\r\ntrue and equally disgraceful. It is not true that Montenegro is as much\r\nruled by financiers as Prussia, just as it is not true that as many men\r\nin the Kaiserstrasse, in Berlin, wear long knives in their belts as wear\r\nthem in the neighbourhood of the Black Mountain. It is not true that\r\nevery peasant from one of the old Russian communes is the immediate\r\nservant of a rich man, as is every employee of Mr. Rockefeller. It is as\r\nfalse as the statement that no poor people in America can read or write.\r\nThere is an element of Capitalism in all modern countries, as there is\r\nan element of illiteracy in all modern countries. There are some who\r\nthink that the number of our fellow-citizens who can sign their names\r\nought to comfort us for the extreme fewness of those who have anything\r\nin the bank to sign it for, but I am not one of these.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the position of Krupp has certain interesting aspects. When\r\nwe talk of Army contractors as among the base but active actualities of\r\nwar, we commonly mean that while the contractor benefits by the war,\r\nthe war, on the whole, rather suffers by the contractor. We regard this\r\nunsoldierly middleman with disgust, or great anger, or contemptuous\r\nacquiescence, or commercial dread and silence, according to our personal\r\nposition and character. But we nowhere think of him as having anything\r\nto do with fighting in the final sense. Those worthy and wealthy persons\r\nwho employ women’s labour at a few shillings a week do not do it to\r\nobtain the best clothes for the soldiers, but to make a sufficient\r\nprofit on the worst. The only argument is whether such clothes are just\r\ngood enough for the soldiers, or are too bad for anybody or anything. We\r\ntolerate the contractor, or we do not tolerate him; but no one admires\r\nhim especially, and certainly no one gives him any credit for any\r\nsuccess in the war. Confessedly or unconfessedly we knock his profits,\r\nnot only off what goes to the taxpayer, but what goes to the soldier. We\r\nknow the Army will not fight any better, at least, because the clothes\r\nthey wear were stitched by wretched women who could hardly see; or\r\nbecause their boots were made by harassed helots, who never had time to\r\nthink. In war-time it is very widely confessed that Capitalism is not a\r\ngood way of ruling a patriotic or self-respecting people, and all sorts\r\nof other things, from strict State organisation to quite casual personal\r\ncharity, are hastily substituted for it. It is recognised that the\r\n“great employer,” nine times out of ten, is no more than the schoolboy\r\nor the page who pilfers tarts and sweets from the dishes as they go up\r\nand down. How angry one is with him depends on temperament, on the stage\r\nof the dinner--also on the number of tarts.\r\n\r\nNow here comes in the real and sinister significance of Krupps. There\r\nare many capitalists in Europe as rich, as vulgar, as selfish, as\r\nrootedly opposed to any fellowship of the fortunate and unfortunate. But\r\nthere is no other capitalist who claims, or can pretend to claim, that\r\nhe has very appreciably _helped_ the activities of his people in war. I\r\nwill suppose that Lipton did not deserve the very severe criticisms\r\nmade on his firm by Mr. Justice Darling; but, however blameless he was,\r\nnobody can suppose that British soldiers would charge better with the\r\nbayonet because they had some particular kind of groceries inside them.\r\nBut Krupp can make a plausible claim that the huge infernal machines to\r\nwhich his country owes nearly all of its successes could only have been\r\nproduced under the equally infernal conditions of the modern factory\r\nand the urban and proletarian civilisation. That is why the victory of\r\nGermany would be simply the victory of Krupp, and the victory of Krupp\r\nwould be simply the victory of Capitalism. There, and there alone,\r\nCapitalism would be able to point to something done successfully for a\r\nwhole nation--done (as it would certainly maintain) better than small\r\nfree States or natural democracies could have done it. I confess I think\r\nthe modern Germans morally second-rate, and I think that even war, when\r\nit is conducted most successfully by machinery, is second-rate war. But\r\nthis second-rate war will become not only the first but the only brand,\r\nif the cannon of Krupp should conquer; and, what is very much worse, it\r\nwill be the only intelligent answer that any capitalist has yet given\r\nagainst our case that Capitalism is as wasteful and as weak as it is\r\ncertainly wicked. I do not fear any such finality, for I happen to\r\nbelieve in the kind of men who fight best with bayonets and whose\r\nfathers hammered their own pikes for the French Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TOWER OF BEBEL\r\n\r\nAmong the cloudy and symbolic stories in the beginning of the Bible\r\nthere is one about a tower built with such vertical energy as to take a\r\nhold on heaven, but ruined and resulting only in a confusion of tongues.\r\nThe story might be interpreted in many ways--religiously, as meaning\r\nthat spiritual insolence starts all human separations; irreligiously,\r\nas meaning that the inhuman heavens grudge man his magnificent dream;\r\nor merely satirically as suggesting that all attempts to reach a higher\r\nagreement always end in more disagreement than there was before. It\r\nmight be taken by the partially intelligent Kensitite as a judgment on\r\nLatin Christians for talking Latin. It might be taken by the somewhat\r\nless intelligent Professor Harnack as a final proof that all prehistoric\r\nhumanity talked German. But when all was said, the symbol would remain\r\nthat a plain tower, as straight as a sword, as simple as a lily, did\r\nnevertheless produce the deepest divisions that have been known among\r\nmen. In any case we of the world in revolt--Syndicalists, Socialists,\r\nGuild Socialists, or whatever we call ourselves--have no need to worry\r\nabout the scripture or the allegory. We have the reality. For whatever\r\nreason, what is said to have happened to the people of Shinak has\r\nprecisely and practically happened to us.\r\n\r\nNone of us who have known Socialists (or rather, to speak more\r\ntruthfully, none of us who have been Socialists) can entertain the\r\nfaintest doubt that a fine intellectual sincerity lay behind what\r\nwas called “L’Internationale.” It was really felt that Socialism was\r\nuniversal like arithmetic. It was too true for idiom or turn of phrase.\r\nIn the formula of Karl Marx men could find that frigid fellowship which\r\nthey find when they agree that two and two make four. It was almost as\r\nbroadminded as a religious dogma.\r\n\r\nYet this universal language has not succeeded, at a moment of crisis,\r\nin imposing itself on the whole world. Nay, it has not, at the moment\r\nof crisis, succeeded in imposing itself on its own principal champions.\r\nHerve is not talking Economic Esperanto; he is talking French. Bebel is\r\nnot talking Economic Esperanto; he is talking German. Blatchford is\r\nnot talking Economic Esperanto; he is talking English, and jolly good\r\nEnglish, too. I do not know whether French or Flemish was Vandervelde’s\r\nnursery speech, but I am quite certain he will know more of it after\r\nthis struggle than he knew before. In short, whether or no there be a\r\nnew union of hearts, there has really and truly been a new division of\r\ntongues.\r\n\r\nHow are we to explain this singular truth, even if we deplore it? I\r\ndismiss with fitting disdain the notion that it is a mere result of\r\nmilitary terrorism or snobbish social pressure. The Socialist leaders\r\nof modern Europe are among the most sincere men in history; and their\r\nNationalist note in this affair has had the ring of their sincerity. I\r\nwill not waste time on the speculation that Vandervelde is bullied by\r\nBelgian priests; or that Blatchford is frightened of the horse-guards\r\noutside Whitehall. These great men support the enthusiasm of their\r\nconventional countrymen because they share it; and they share it because\r\nthere is (though perhaps only at certain great moments) such a thing as\r\npure democracy.\r\n\r\nTimour the Tartar, I think, celebrated some victory with a tower built\r\nentirely out of human skulls; perhaps he thought _that_ would reach to\r\nheaven. But there is no cement in such building; the veins and ligaments\r\nthat hold humanity together have long fallen away; the skulls will roll\r\nimpotently at a touch; and ten thousand more such trophies could only\r\nmake the tower taller and crazier. I think the modern official apparatus\r\nof “votes” is very like that tottering monument. I think the Tartar\r\n“counted heads,” like an electioneering agent. Sometimes when I have\r\nseen from the platform of some paltry party meeting the rows and rows of\r\ngrinning upturned faces, I have felt inclined to say, as the poet does\r\nin the “The Vision of Sin”--“Welcome fellow-citizens, Hollow hearts and\r\nempty heads.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNot that the people were personally hollow or empty, but they had come\r\non a hollow and empty business: to help the good Mr. Binks to strengthen\r\nthe Insurance Act against the wicked Mr. Jinks who would only promise\r\nto fortify the Insurance Act. That night it did not blow the democratic\r\ngale. Yet it can blow on these as on others; and when it does blow men\r\nlearn many things. I, for one, am not above learning them.\r\n\r\nThe Marxian dogma which simplifies all conflicts to the Class War is so\r\nmuch nobler a thing than the nose-counting of the parliaments that one\r\nmust apologise for the comparison. And yet there is a comparison.\r\nWhen we used to say that there were so many thousands of Socialists\r\nin Germany, we were counting by skulls. When we said that the majority\r\nconsisting of Proletarians would be everywhere opposed to the minority,\r\nconsisting of Capitalists, we were counting by skulls. Why, yes; if all\r\nmen’s heads had been cut off from the rest of them, as they were by the\r\ngood sense and foresight of Timour the Tartar; if they had no hearts or\r\nbellies to be moved; no hand that flies up to ward off a weapon, no foot\r\nthat can feel a familiar soil--if things were so the Marxian calculation\r\nwould be not only complete but correct. As we know to-day, the Marxian\r\ncalculation is complete, but it is not correct.\r\n\r\nNow, this is the answer to the questions of some kind critics, whose\r\nactual words I have not within reach at the moment, about whether my\r\ndemocracy meant the rule of the majority over the minority. It means the\r\nrule of the rule--the rule of the rule over the exception. When a nation\r\nfinds a soul it clothes it with a body, and does verily act like one\r\nliving thing. There is nothing to be said about those who are out of it,\r\nexcept that they are out of it. After talking about it in the abstract\r\nfor decades, this is Democracy, and it is marvellous in our eyes. It is\r\nnot the difference between ninety-nine persons and a hundred persons; it\r\nis one person--the people. I do not know or care how many or how few of\r\nthe Belgians like or dislike the pictures of Wiertz. They could not be\r\neither justified or condemned by a mere majority of Belgians. But I am\r\nvery certain that the defiance to Prussia did not come from a majority\r\nof Belgians. It came from Belgium one and indivisible--atheists,\r\npriests, princes of the blood, Frenchified shopkeepers, Flemish boors,\r\nmen, women, and children, and the sooner we understand that this sort of\r\nthing can happen the better for us. For it is this spontaneous spiritual\r\nfellowship of communities under certain conditions to which the four or\r\nfive most independent minds of Europe willingly bear witness to-day.\r\n\r\nBut is there no exception: is there no one faithful among the unfaithful\r\nfound? Is no great Socialist politician still untouched by the\r\npatriotism of the vulgar? Why, yes; the rugged Ramsay MacDonald, scarred\r\nwith a hundred savage fights against the capitalist parties, still lifts\r\nup his horny hand for peace. What further need have we of witnesses?\r\nI, for my part, am quite satisfied, and do not doubt that Mr. MacDonald\r\nwill be as industrious in damping down democracy in this form as in\r\nevery other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA REAL DANGER\r\n\r\nHeaven forbid that I should once more wade in those swamps of logomachy\r\nand tautology in which the old guard of the Determinists still seem to\r\nbe floundering. The question of Fate and Free Will can never attain to\r\na conclusion, though it may attain to a conviction. The shortest\r\nphilosophic summary is that both cause and choice are ultimate ideas\r\nwithin us, and that if one man denies choice because it seems contrary\r\nto cause, the other man has quite as much right to deny cause because\r\nit seems contrary to choice. The shortest ethical summary is that\r\nDeterminism either affects conduct or it does not. If it does not, it is\r\nmorally not worth preaching; if it does, it must affect conduct in the\r\ndirection of impotence and submission. A writer in the “Clarion” says\r\nthat the reformer cannot help trying to reform, nor the Conservative\r\nhelp his Conservatism. But suppose the reformer tries to reform the\r\nConservative and turn him into another reformer? Either he can, in which\r\ncase Determinism has made no difference at all, or he can’t, in which\r\ncase it can only have made reformers more hopeless and Conservatives\r\nmore obstinate. And the shortest practical and political summary is that\r\nworking men, most probably, will soon be much too busy using their Free\r\nWill to stop to prove that they have got it. Nevertheless, I like to\r\nwatch the Determinist in the “Clarion” Cockpit every week, as busy as a\r\nsquirrel--in a cage. But being myself a squirrel (leaping lightly from\r\nbough to bough) and preferring the form of activity which occasionally\r\nends in nuts, I should not intervene in the matter even indirectly,\r\nexcept upon a practical point. And the point I have in mind is practical\r\nto the extent of deadly peril. It is another of the numerous new ways in\r\nwhich the restless rich, now walking the world with an awful insomnia,\r\nmay manage to catch us napping.\r\n\r\n\r\nMust Be a Mystery\r\n\r\nThere are two letters in the “Clarion” this week which in various ways\r\ninterest me very much. One is concerned to defend Darwin against the\r\nscientific revolt against him that was led by Samuel Butler, and among\r\nother things it calls Bernard Shaw a back number. Well, most certainly\r\n“The Origin of Species” is a back number, in so far as any honest and\r\ninteresting book ever can be; but in pure philosophy nothing can be\r\nout of date, since the universe must be a mystery even to the believer.\r\nThere is, however, one condition of things in which I do call it\r\nrelevant to describe somebody as behind the times. That is when the man\r\nin question, thinking of some state of affairs that has passed away, is\r\nreally helping the very things he would like to hinder. The principles\r\ncannot alter, but the problems can. Thus, I should call a man behind the\r\ntimes who, in the year 1872, pleaded for the peaceful German peasants\r\nagainst the triumphant militarism of Napoleon. Or I should call a man\r\nout of date who, in the year 1892, wished for a stronger Navy to compete\r\nwith the Navy of Holland, because it had once swept the sea and sailed\r\nup the Thames. And I certainly call a man or a movement out of date\r\nthat, in the year 1914, when we few are fighting a giant machine,\r\nstrengthened with all material wealth and worked with all the material\r\nsciences, thinks that our chief danger is from an excess of moral and\r\nreligious responsibility. He reminds me of Mr. Snodgrass, who had the\r\npresence of mind to call out “Fire!” when Mr. Pickwick fell through the\r\nice.\r\n\r\nThe other letter consists of the usual wiredrawn argument for fatalism.\r\nMan cannot imagine the universe being created, and therefore is\r\n“compelled by his reason” to think the universe without beginning or\r\nend, which (I may remark) he cannot imagine either. But the letter ends\r\nwith something much more ominous than bad metaphysics. Here, in\r\nthe middle of the “Clarion,” in the centre of a clean and combative\r\ndemocratic sheet, I meet again my deplorable old acquaintance, the\r\nscientific criminologist. “The so-called evil-doer should not be\r\npunished for his acts, but restrained.” In forty-eight hours I could\r\nprobably get a petition to that effect signed by millionaires. A short\r\ntime ago a Bill was introduced to hold irresponsible and “restrain” a\r\nwhole new class of people, who were “incapable of managing their affairs\r\nwith prudence.” Read the supporters’ names on the back of that Bill, and\r\nsee what sort of democrats they were.\r\n\r\nNow, clearing our heads of what is called popular science (which means\r\ngoing to sleep to a lullaby of long words), let us use our own brains a\r\nlittle, and ask ourselves what is the real difference between punishing\r\na man and restraining him. The material difference may be any or none;\r\nfor punishment may be very mild, and restraint may be very ruthless. The\r\nman, of course, must dislike one as much as the other, or it would not\r\nbe necessary to restrain him at all. And I assure you he will get no\r\ngreat glow of comfort out of your calling him irresponsible after you\r\nhave made him impotent. A man does not necessarily feel more free and\r\neasy in a straight waistcoat than in a stone cell. The moral difference\r\nis that a man can be punished for a crime because he is born a citizen;\r\nwhile he can be constrained because he is born a slave. But one\r\narresting and tremendous difference towers over all these doubtful or\r\narguable differences. There is one respect, vital to all our liberties\r\nand all our lives, in which the new restraint would be different\r\nfrom the old punishment. It is of this that the plutocrats will take\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Plain Difference\r\n\r\nThe perfectly plain difference is this. All punishment, even the most\r\nhorrible, proceeds upon the assumption that the extent of the evil is\r\nknown, and that a certain amount of expiation goes with it. Even if\r\nyou hang the man, you cannot hang him twice. Even if you burn him,\r\nyou cannot burn him for a month. And in the case of all ordinary\r\nimprisonments, the whole aim of free institutions from the beginning of\r\nthe world has been to insist that a man shall be convicted of a definite\r\ncrime and confined for a definite period. But the moment you admit this\r\nnotion of medical restraint, you must in fairness admit that it may go\r\non as long as the authorities choose to think (or say) that it ought\r\nto go on. The man’s punishment refers to the past, which is supposed\r\nto have been investigated, and which, in some degree at least, has been\r\ninvestigated. But his restraint refers to the future, which his doctors,\r\nkeepers, and wardens have yet to investigate. The simple result will be\r\nthat, in the scientific Utopia of the “Clarion,” men like Mann or Syme\r\nor Larkin will not be put in prison because of what they have done.\r\nThey will be kept in prison because of what they might do. Indeed, the\r\nbuilders of the new tyranny have already come very near to avowing\r\nthis scientific and futurist method. When the lawyers tried to stop the\r\n“Suffragette” from appearing at all, they practically said: “We do not\r\nknow your next week’s crime, because it isn’t committed yet; but we are\r\nscientifically certain you have the criminal type. And by the sublime\r\nand unalterable laws of heredity, all your poor little papers will\r\ninherit it.”\r\n\r\nThis is a purely practical question; and that is why I insist on it,\r\neven in such strenuous times. The writers on the “Clarion” have a\r\nperfect right to think Christianity is the foe of freedom, or even\r\nthat the stupidity and tyranny of the present Government is due to the\r\nmonkish mysticism of Lord Morley and Mr. John M. Robertson. They have a\r\nright to think the theory of Determinism as true as Calvin thought it.\r\nBut I do not like seeing them walk straight into the enormous iron trap\r\nset open by the Capitalists, who find it convenient to make our law even\r\nmore lawless than it is. The rich men want a scientist to write them a\r\n_lettre de cachet_ as a doctor writes a prescription. And so they wish\r\nto seal up in a public gaol the scandals of a private asylum. Yes; the\r\nwriters on the “Clarion” are indeed claiming irresponsibility for human\r\nbeings. But it is the governments that will be irresponsible, not the\r\ngoverned.\r\n\r\nBut I will tell them one small secret in conclusion. There is nothing\r\nwhatever wrong in the ancient and universal idea of Punishment--except\r\nthat we are not punishing the right people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DREGS OF PURITANISM\r\n\r\nOne peculiarity of the genuine kind of enemy of the people is that his\r\nslightest phrase is clamorous with all his sins. Pride, vain-glory, and\r\nhypocrisy seem present in his very grammar; in his very verbs or adverbs\r\nor prepositions, as well as in what he says, which is generally bad\r\nenough. Thus I see that a Nonconformist pastor in Bromley has been\r\ntalking about the pathetic little presents of tobacco sent to the common\r\nsoldiers. This is how he talks about it. He is reported as having said,\r\n“By the help of God, they wanted this cigarette business stopped.” How\r\none could write a volume on that sentence, a great thick volume called\r\n“The Decline of the English Middle Class.” In taste, in style, in\r\nphilosophy, in feeling, in political project, the horrors of it are as\r\nunfathomable as hell.\r\n\r\nFirst, to begin with the trifle, note something slipshod and vague in\r\nthe mere verbiage, typical of those who prefer a catchword to a creed.\r\n“This cigarette business” might mean anything. It might mean Messrs.\r\nSalmon and Gluckstein’s business. But the pastor at Bromley will not\r\ninterfere with that, for the indignation of his school of thought, even\r\nwhen it is sincere, always instinctively and unconsciously swerves\r\naside from anything that is rich and powerful like the partners in a big\r\nbusiness, and strikes instead something that is poor and nameless like\r\nthe soldiers in a trench. Nor does the expression make clear who “they”\r\n are--whether the inhabitants of Britain or the inhabitants of Bromley,\r\nor the inhabitants of this one crazy tabernacle in Bromley; nor is it\r\nevident how it is going to be stopped or who is being asked to stop it.\r\nAll these things are trifles compared to the more terrible offences\r\nof the phrase; but they are not without their social and historical\r\ninterest. About the beginning of the nineteenth century the wealthy\r\nPuritan class, generally the class of the employers of labour, took a\r\nline of argument which was narrow, but not nonsensical. They saw the\r\nrelation of rich and poor quite coldly as a contract, but they saw that\r\na contract holds both ways. The Puritans of the middle class, in short,\r\ndid in some sense start talking and thinking for themselves. They are\r\nstill talking. They have long ago left off thinking. They talk about the\r\nloyalty of workmen to their employers, and God knows what rubbish; and\r\nthe first small certainty about the reverend gentleman whose sentence\r\nI have quoted is that his brain stopped working as a clock stops, years\r\nand years ago.\r\n\r\nSecond, consider the quality of the religious literature! These people\r\nare always telling us that the English translated Bible is sufficient\r\ntraining for anyone in noble and appropriate diction; and so it is. Why,\r\nthen, are they not trained? They are always telling us that Bunyan, the\r\nrude Midland tinker, is as much worth reading as Chaucer or Spenser;\r\nand so he is. Why, then, have they not read him? I cannot believe\r\nthat anyone who had seen, even in a nightmare of the nursery, Apollyon\r\nstraddling over the whole breadth of the way could really write like\r\nthat about a cigarette. By the help of God, they wanted this cigarette\r\nbusiness stopped. Therefore, with angels and archangels and the whole\r\ncompany of Heaven, with St. Michael, smiter of Satan and Captain of\r\nthe Chivalry of God, with all the ardour of the seraphs and the flaming\r\npatience of the saints, we will have this cigarette business stopped.\r\nWhere has all the tradition of the great religious literatures gone to\r\nthat a man should come on such a bathos with such a bump?\r\n\r\nThirdly, of course, there is the lack of imaginative proportion, which\r\nrises into a sort of towering blasphemy. An enormous number of live\r\nyoung men are being hurt by shells, hurt by bullets, hurt by fever\r\nand hunger and horror of hope deferred; hurt by lance blades and sword\r\nblades and bayonet blades breaking into the bloody house of life. But\r\nMr. Price (I think that’s his name) is still anxious that they should\r\nnot be hurt by cigarettes. That is the sort of maniacal isolation that\r\ncan be found in the deserts of Bromley. That cigarettes are bad for\r\nthe health is a very tenable opinion to which the minister is quite\r\nentitled. If he happens to think that the youth of Bromley smoke too\r\nmany cigarettes, and that he has any influence in urging on them the\r\nunhealthiness of the habit, I should not blame him if he gave sermons\r\nor lectures about it (with magic-lantern slides), so long as it was in\r\nBromley and about Bromley. Cigarettes may be bad for the health: bombs\r\nand bayonets and even barbed wire are not good for the health. I never\r\nmet a doctor who recommended any of them. But the trouble with this sort\r\nof man is that he cannot adjust himself to the scale of things. He would\r\ndo very good service if he would go among the rich aristocratic ladies\r\nand tell them not to take drugs in a chronic sense, as people take opium\r\nin China. But he would be doing very bad service if he were to go among\r\nthe doctors and nurses on the field and tell them not to give drugs, as\r\nthey give morphia in a hospital. But it is the whole hypothesis of war,\r\nit is its very nature and first principle, that the man in the trench\r\nis almost as much a suffering and abnormal person as the man in the\r\nhospital. Hit or unhit, conqueror or conquered, he is, by nature of the\r\ncase, having less pleasure than is proper and natural to a man.\r\n\r\nFourth (for I need not dwell here on the mere diabolical idiocy that can\r\nregard beer or tobacco as in some way evil and unseemly in themselves),\r\nthere is the most important element in this strange outbreak; at least,\r\nthe most dangerous and the most important for us. There is that\r\nmain feature in the degradation of the old middle class: the utter\r\ndisappearance of its old appetite for liberty. Here there is no question\r\nof whether the men are to smoke cigarettes, or the women choose to\r\nsend cigarettes, or even that the officers or doctors choose to allow\r\ncigarettes. The thing is to cease, and we may note one of the most\r\nrecurrent ideas of the servile State: it is mentioned in the passive\r\nmood. It must be stopped, and we must not even ask who has stopped it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TYRANNY OF BAD JOURNALISM\r\n\r\nThe amazing decision of the Government to employ methods quite alien to\r\nEngland, and rather belonging to the police of the Continent, probably\r\narises from the appearance of papers which are lucid and fighting, like\r\nthe papers of the Continent. The business may be put in many ways. But\r\none way of putting it is simply to say that a monopoly of bad journalism\r\nis resisting the possibility of good journalism. Journalism is not the\r\nsame thing as literature; but there is good and bad journalism, as there\r\nis good and bad literature, as there is good and bad football. For the\r\nlast twenty years or so the plutocrats who govern England have allowed\r\nthe English nothing but bad journalism. Very bad journalism, simply\r\nconsidered as journalism.\r\n\r\nIt always takes a considerable time to see the simple and central fact\r\nabout anything. All sorts of things have been said about the modern\r\nPress, especially the Yellow Press; that it is Jingo or Philistine or\r\nsensational or wrongly inquisitive or vulgar or indecent or trivial; but\r\nnone of these have anything really to do with the point.\r\n\r\nThe point about the Press is that it is not what it is called. It is not\r\nthe “popular Press.” It is not the public Press. It is not an organ\r\nof public opinion. It is a conspiracy of a very few millionaires, all\r\nsufficiently similar in type to agree on the limits of what this great\r\nnation (to which we belong) may know about itself and its friends and\r\nenemies. The ring is not quite complete; there are old-fashioned and\r\nhonest papers: but it is sufficiently near to completion to produce on\r\nthe ordinary purchaser of news the practical effects of a corner and\r\na monopoly. He receives all his political information and all\r\nhis political marching orders from what is by this time a sort of\r\nhalf-conscious secret society, with very few members, but a great deal\r\nof money.\r\n\r\nThis enormous and essential fact is concealed for us by a number of\r\nlegends that have passed into common speech. There is the notion that\r\nthe Press is flashy or trivial _because_ it is popular. In other words,\r\nan attempt is made to discredit democracy by representing journalism\r\nas the natural literature of democracy. All this is cold rubbish.\r\nThe democracy has no more to do with the papers than it has with the\r\npeerages. The millionaire newspapers are vulgar and silly because the\r\nmillionaires are vulgar and silly. It is the proprietor, not the editor,\r\nnot the sub-editor, least of all the reader, who is pleased with this\r\nmonotonous prairie of printed words. The same slander on democracy can\r\nbe noticed in the case of advertisements. There is many a tender old\r\nTory imagination that vaguely feels that our streets would be hung with\r\nescutcheons and tapestries, if only the profane vulgar had not hung them\r\nwith advertisements of Sapolio and Sunlight Soap. But advertisement does\r\nnot come from the unlettered many. It comes from the refined few.\r\nDid you ever hear of a mob rising to placard the Town Hall with\r\nproclamations in favour of Sapolio? Did you ever see a poor, ragged\r\nman laboriously drawing and painting a picture on the wall in favour\r\nof Sunlight Soap--simply as a labour of love? It is nonsense; those who\r\nhang our public walls with ugly pictures are the same select few who\r\nhang their private walls with exquisite and expensive pictures. The\r\nvulgarisation of modern life has come from the governing class; from the\r\nhighly educated class. Most of the people who have posters in Camberwell\r\nhave peerages at Westminster. But the strongest instance of all is that\r\nwhich has been unbroken until lately, and still largely prevails; the\r\nghastly monotony of the Press.\r\n\r\nThen comes that other legend; the notion that men like the masters of\r\nthe Newspaper Trusts “give the people what they want.” Why, it is the\r\nwhole aim and definition of a Trust that it gives the people what it\r\nchooses. In the old days, when Parliaments were free in England, it\r\nwas discovered that one courtier was allowed to sell all the silk, and\r\nanother to sell all the sweet wine. A member of the House of Commons\r\nhumorously asked who was allowed to sell all the bread. I really tremble\r\nto think what that sarcastic legislator would have said if he had been\r\nput off with the modern nonsense about “gauging the public taste.”\r\n Suppose the first courtier had said that, by his shrewd, self-made\r\nsense, he had detected that people had a vague desire for silk; and\r\neven a deep, dim human desire to pay so much a yard for it! Suppose\r\nthe second courtier said that he had, by his own rugged intellect,\r\ndiscovered a general desire for wine: and that people bought his wine\r\nat his price--when they could buy no other! Suppose a third courtier had\r\njumped up and said that people always bought his bread when they could\r\nget none anywhere else.\r\n\r\nWell, that is a perfect parallel. “After bread, the need of the people\r\nis knowledge,” said Danton. Knowledge is now a monopoly, and comes\r\nthrough to the citizens in thin and selected streams, exactly as bread\r\nmight come through to a besieged city. Men must wish to know what is\r\nhappening, whoever has the privilege of telling them. They must listen\r\nto the messenger, even if he is a liar. They must listen to the liar,\r\neven if he is a bore. The official journalist for some time past has\r\nbeen both a bore and a liar; but it was impossible until lately to\r\nneglect his sheets of news altogether. Lately the capitalist Press\r\nreally has begun to be neglected; because its bad journalism was\r\noverpowering and appalling. Lately we have really begun to find out that\r\ncapitalism cannot write, just as it cannot fight, or pray, or marry, or\r\nmake a joke, or do any other stricken human thing. But this discovery\r\nhas been quite recent. The capitalist newspaper was never actually\r\nunread until it was actually unreadable.\r\n\r\nIf you retain the servile superstition that the Press, as run by the\r\ncapitalists, is popular (in any sense except that in which dirty water\r\nin a desert is popular), consider the case of the solemn articles in\r\npraise of the men who own newspapers--men of the type of Cadbury or\r\nHarmsworth, men of the type of the small club of millionaires. Did you\r\never hear a plain man in a tramcar or train talking about Carnegie’s\r\nbright genial smile or Rothschild’s simple, easy hospitality? Did you\r\never hear an ordinary citizen ask what was the opinion of Sir Joseph\r\nLyons about the hopes and fears of this, our native land? These few\r\nsmall-minded men publish, papers to praise themselves. You could no more\r\nget an intelligent poor man to praise a millionaire’s soul, except for\r\nhire, than you could get him to sell a millionaire’s soap, except for\r\nhire. And I repeat that, though there are other aspects of the matter of\r\nthe new plutocratic raid, one of the most important is mere journalistic\r\njealousy. The Yellow Press is bad journalism: and wishes to stop the\r\nappearance of good journalism.\r\n\r\nThere is no average member of the public who would not prefer to have\r\nLloyd George discussed as what he is, a Welshman of genius and ideals,\r\nstrangely fascinated by bad fashion and bad finance, rather than\r\ndiscussed as what neither he nor anyone else ever was, a perfect\r\ndemocrat or an utterly detestable demagogue. There is no reader of a\r\ndaily paper who would not feel more concern--and more respect--for Sir\r\nRufus Isaacs as a man who has been a stockbroker, than as a man who\r\nhappens to be Attorney-General. There is no man in the street who is not\r\nmore interested in Lloyd George’s investments than in his Land Campaign.\r\nThere is no man in the street who could not understand (and like)\r\nRufus Isaacs as a Jew better than he can possibly like him as a British\r\nstatesman. There is no sane journalist alive who would say that the\r\nofficial account of Marconis would be better “copy” than the true\r\naccount that such papers as this have dragged out. We have committed one\r\ncrime against the newspaper proprietor which he will never forgive. We\r\npoint out that his papers are dull. And we propose to print some papers\r\nthat are interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POETRY OF THE REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nEveryone but a consistent and contented capitalist, who must be\r\nsomething pretty near to a Satanist, must rejoice at the spirit and\r\nsuccess of the Battle of the Buses. But one thing about it which happens\r\nto please me particularly was that it was fought, in one aspect at\r\nleast, on a point such as the plutocratic fool calls unpractical. It\r\nwas fought about a symbol, a badge, a thing attended with no kind of\r\npractical results, like the flags for which men allow themselves to fall\r\ndown dead, or the shrines for which men will walk some hundreds of miles\r\nfrom their homes. When a man has an eye for business, all that goes on\r\non this earth in that style is simply invisible to him. But let us be\r\ncharitable to the eye for business; the eye has been pretty well blacked\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\nBut I wish to insist here that it is exactly what is called the\r\nunpractical part of the thing that is really the practical. The chief\r\ndifference between men and the animals is that all men are artists;\r\nthough the overwhelming majority of us are bad artists. As the old fable\r\ntruly says, lions do not make statues; even the cunning of the fox can\r\ngo no further than the accomplishment of leaving an exact model of\r\nthe vulpine paw: and even that is an accomplishment which he wishes\r\nhe hadn’t got. There are Chryselephantine statues, but no purely\r\nelephantine ones. And, though we speak in a general way of an elephant\r\ntrumpeting, it is only by human blandishments that he can be induced to\r\nplay the drum. But man, savage or civilised, simple or complex\r\nalways desires to see his own soul outside himself; in some material\r\nembodiment. He always wishes to point to a table in a temple, or a cloth\r\non a stick, or a word on a scroll, or a badge on a coat, and say: “This\r\nis the best part of me. If need be, it shall be the rest of me that\r\nshall perish.” This is the method which seems so unbusinesslike to the\r\nmen with an eye to business. This is also the method by which battles\r\nare won.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Symbolism of the Badge\r\n\r\nThe badge on a Trade Unionist’s coat is a piece of poetry in the\r\ngenuine, lucid, and logical sense in which Milton defined poetry (and\r\nhe ought to know) when he said that it was simple, sensuous, and\r\npassionate. It is simple, because many understand the word “badge,”\r\n who might not even understand the word “recognition.” It is sensuous,\r\nbecause it is visible and tangible; it is incarnate, as all the good\r\nGods have been; and it is passionate in this perfectly practical sense,\r\nwhich the man with an eye to business may some day learn more thoroughly\r\nthan he likes, that there are men who will allow you to cross a word\r\nout in a theoretical document, but who will not allow you to pull a big\r\nbutton off their bodily clothing, merely because you have more money\r\nthan they have. Now I think it is this sensuousness, this passion, and,\r\nabove all, this simplicity that are most wanted in this promising revolt\r\nof our time. For this simplicity is perhaps the only thing in which the\r\nbest type of recent revolutionists have failed. It has been our\r\nsorrow lately to salute the sunset of one of the very few clean and\r\nincorruptible careers in the most corruptible phase of Christendom. The\r\ndeath of Quelch naturally turns one’s thoughts to those extreme Marxian\r\ntheorists, who, whatever we may hold about their philosophy, have\r\ncertainly held their honour like iron. And yet, even in this instant\r\nof instinctive reverence, I cannot feel that they were poetical enough,\r\nthat is childish enough, to make a revolution. They had all the audacity\r\nneeded for speaking to the despot; but not the simplicity needed for\r\nspeaking to the democracy. They were always accused of being too bitter\r\nagainst the capitalist. But it always seemed to me that they were (quite\r\nunconsciously, of course) much too kind to him. They had a fatal habit\r\nof using long words, even on occasions when he might with propriety have\r\nbeen described in very short words. They called him a Capitalist when\r\nalmost anybody in Christendom would have called him a cad. And “cad”\r\n is a word from the poetic vocabulary indicating rather a general and\r\npowerful reaction of the emotions than a status that could be defined\r\nin a work of economics. The capitalist, asleep in the sun, let such long\r\nwords crawl all over him, like so many long, soft, furry caterpillars.\r\nCaterpillars cannot sting like wasps. And, in repeating that the old\r\nMarxians have been, perhaps, the best and bravest men of our time, I say\r\nalso that they would have been better and braver still if they had never\r\nused a scientific word, and never read anything but fairy tales.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Beastly Individualist\r\n\r\nSuppose I go on to a ship, and the ship sinks almost immediately; but\r\nI (like the people in the Bab Ballads), by reason of my clinging to a\r\nmast, upon a desert island am eventually cast. Or rather, suppose I am\r\nnot cast on it, but am kept bobbing about in the water, because the only\r\nman on the island is what some call an Individualist, and will not throw\r\nme a rope; though coils of rope of the most annoying elaboration and\r\nneatness are conspicuous beside him as he stands upon the shore. Now,\r\nit seems to me, that if, in my efforts to shout at this fellow-creature\r\nacross the crashing breakers, I call his position the “insularistic\r\nposition,” and my position “the semi-amphibian position,” much valuable\r\ntime may be lost. I am not an amphibian. I am a drowning man. He is\r\nnot an insularist, or an individualist. He is a beast. Or rather, he\r\nis worse than any beast can be. And if, instead of letting me drown, he\r\nmakes me promise, while I am drowning, that if I come on shore it shall\r\nbe as his bodily slave, having no human claims henceforward forever,\r\nthen, by the whole theory and practice of capitalism, he becomes a\r\ncapitalist, he also becomes a cad.\r\n\r\nNow, the language of poetry is simpler than that of prose; as anyone\r\ncan see who has read what the old-fashioned protestant used to call\r\nconfidently “his” Bible. And, being simpler, it is also truer; and,\r\nbeing truer, it is also fiercer. And, for most of the infamies of our\r\ntime, there is really nothing plain enough, except the plain language of\r\npoetry. Take, let us say, the ease of the recent railway disaster,\r\nand the acquittal of the capitalists’ interest. It is not a scientific\r\nproblem for us to investigate. It is a crime committed before our eyes;\r\ncommitted, perhaps, by blind men or maniacs, or men hypnotised, or men\r\nin some other ways unconscious; but committed in broad daylight, so that\r\nthe corpse is bleeding on our door-step. Good lives were lost, because\r\ngood lives do not pay; and bad coals do pay. It seems simply impossible\r\nto get any other meaning out of the matter except that. And, if in human\r\nhistory there be anything simple and anything horrible, it seems to have\r\nbeen present in this matter. If, even after some study and understanding\r\nof the old religious passions which were the resurrection of Europe,\r\nwe cannot endure the extreme infamy of witches and heretics literally\r\nburned alive--well, the people in this affair were quite as literally\r\nburned alive. If, when we have really tried to extend our charity beyond\r\nthe borders of personal sympathy, to all the complexities of class\r\nand creed, we still feel something insolent about the triumphant and\r\nacquitted man who is in the wrong, here the men who are in the wrong are\r\ntriumphant and acquitted. It is no subject for science. It is a subject\r\nfor poetry. But for poetry of a terrible sort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Utopia of Usurers and other Essays, by\r\nGilbert Keith Chesterton\r\n\r\n***",
