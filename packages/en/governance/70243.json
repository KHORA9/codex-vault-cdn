The injury to\r\nemployers from such a course is evident; but the detriment to the workers\r\nthemselves is less obvious, and the calamitous effect on the community is\r\nseldom realized. That difficulty is what we call “the Labour problem”; a\r\nknowledge of the principles on which it can best be solved is our chief\r\nnational necessity.\r\n\r\nThis book strives to criticize the wrong, and indicate the right,\r\nsolution. The test which it applies is whether a solution places the\r\ncommunity before section or party, or is one designed primarily to\r\nadvance sectarian interests, political or industrial, either avowedly,\r\nor speciously, under professions of solicitude for the public good.\r\nNowadays, one has to look well below the surface of words, however\r\ndistinguished may be their origin. There is little to choose between the\r\nrevolutionary Socialist, whose solution consists in thrusting industrial\r\ndemocracy into supreme economic or political power through ruthless\r\ndirect action and then socializing industry, and the constitutional\r\nanti-Socialist, who would solve the problem by pledges to inaugurate a\r\nnew industrial Heaven and Earth, and other “ninepenny-for-fourpence”\r\npromises, which he has no honest conviction can be redeemed, and which,\r\nif he seriously considered, he would know can never be fulfilled. On\r\nthe whole, during the last few years, the latter has proved the greater\r\nmenace to the nation.\r\n\r\nPolicies for the solution of the Labour problem fall, broadly speaking,\r\ninto two main categories. Those which insist upon, or imply, the\r\nreconstruction of industry by eliminating private enterprise and the\r\ncapitalist. Of this type is the policy for which the Labour Party\r\nstands—the vague abstraction of “nationalization and democratic control.”\r\nAll other policies are of the type which postulates, as essential\r\nto industrial progress, continuance of the so-called capitalistic\r\norganization of industry with, however, amendments and reforms of\r\nvarying character. There is not always that clear-cut distinction. Many\r\nopponents of the Labour Party’s policy are advocates of the particular\r\nmethod of socializing industries known as municipalization, and even of\r\nthe State running certain quasi-industrial ventures like the Post Office.\r\nSuch overlapping and border-line cases must always occur. Human affairs\r\ncan never wholly be regulated by precise formulae; were that possible,\r\nthe world would be a dull place wherein to live.\r\n\r\nIf the Labour problem is to be solved, there must be more clear thinking,\r\ncritical analysis, and decisive action on the part of the general public,\r\nwho forget how vitally they are interested. With the object of placing\r\nbefore them its various elements in logical sequence and balanced\r\nperspective, I have, after much consideration, adopted the following\r\nscheme for this book: I set out in Part I the policy of the Labour Party\r\nfor solution of the problem, and examine its fundamentals; next, I\r\ndescribe in Part II the Government’s Labour policy, so far as it has been\r\ndeclared, or evidenced in departmental practice, and consider it; then,\r\nlastly, I outline in Part III what, in amplification of the Government\r\npolicy and in opposition to that of Labour, I conceive to be the true\r\nsolution, and the one most calculated to promote the interests of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThe Labour Party heralds itself as “the true national democratic\r\nparty,” and as such claims to have formulated a national Labour policy,\r\nwhich, on the most superficial examination, exhibits many indications\r\nof purely sectarian objectives. My effort has been to appraise that\r\npolicy critically but fairly, and see how far it is likely to advance\r\nthe common welfare. This cannot be done unless one clearly appreciates\r\nthe industrial root on to which the so-called national democratic party\r\nhas recently been grafted, and from which it draws all its nurture and\r\nvirility. Part I, therefore, explains in some detail the history and\r\nconstitution of the Labour Party, and also the nature of the root, which,\r\ncalled by the most euphemistic name, is merely a particular species of\r\nSocialism. At the moment, the Labour Party does not seem unduly proud of\r\nits lineage, nor inordinately anxious to force upon the attention of the\r\ncountry its real socialistic aims. But it is essential that they should\r\nbe laid bare, and this I endeavour to do in Part I, not by quotations\r\nfrom Labour leaders’ speeches, which express considerable difference in\r\nviews, according to the forum, are not conspicuous by consistency, and\r\nare regarded as of no binding force by the Party. I give actual extracts\r\nfrom official documents published by the Labour Party, not generally\r\nknown or accessible to the ordinary reader, and which state, if not with\r\nclarity, at any rate in its own language, the principles to which the\r\nParty declares that it has pledged the allegiance of all its followers.\r\n\r\nThe Labour Party arraigns before the bar of public opinion the present\r\nGovernment, and, indeed, all past “Capitalistic Governments,” and\r\ncharges them with having neglected the interests of the workers, and of\r\nbeing devoid of any consistent Labour policy. Such an accusation, if\r\nsufficiently repeated, obtains a certain validity of currency, because\r\nthe public know little of what has been really achieved under Government\r\ndirection. I hold no brief for the present Coalition Government—I\r\nhave often criticized its unfortunate opportunist action in regard to\r\nindustrial matters, and do so freely in this book—but it is vital that\r\nthe public should understand, if only as the foundation on which to\r\nbuild a new and amplified Labour policy, what it and former Governments\r\nhave done, at the expense of the nation, for the workers of the country.\r\nThis is the theme of Part II, and, as any future solution of our\r\nLabour difficulties must be materially influenced by the effect upon\r\nindustry, upon employers and employed, of the emergency measures taken by\r\nGovernment for the regulation of Labour during the war, a chapter in Part\r\nII is devoted to this important matter.\r\n\r\nIn Part III I then proceed to the true purpose of the book—to indicate\r\nin broad outline what seems to me to be the only possible Labour policy\r\nfor the future. It must satisfy, and be attuned to, the human qualities\r\nof the workers; Part III, therefore, starts with a description of the\r\naspirations and sentiments of the workers as I found them in real life,\r\nand then proceeds to set out the principles that I think should govern\r\nthe three greatest relationships in industry—that of the Government to\r\nindustry—that between employers and employed—that between industry and\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\nIn my treatment of the subject I have tried to avoid academic\r\ndisquisition, and to produce a discussion fitting as closely as possible\r\nto the actual realities of workshop life, as they came within my\r\npractical experience, first, as an engineer, and, later, in discharging\r\nfor Government the duties of many war-time offices involving the control\r\nof labour. My own ascertainment of facts is opposed in many respects to\r\nwhat has been stated by other writers, but some three thousand close and\r\nintimate conferences during the war with employers’ organizations, Trade\r\nUnion executives, district and branch committees, together with many\r\nmass meetings—at all of which careful notes were taken—to say nothing of\r\nhaving one’s finger daily on the pulse of over one million men, supply me\r\nwith a groundwork of facts sufficiently convincing at any rate to my own\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nThat the Labour problem can eventually be solved with success by resolute\r\nperseverance along the line of principles suggested in Part III I feel\r\ncertain. In the robust common sense of the British employer and the\r\nBritish workmen I have the utmost confidence. Of its ultimate triumph\r\nI am convinced. Time after time, during the war, when an industrial\r\ncatastrophe seemed inevitable, I have seen common sense, acting on the\r\nnational genius for compromise, serve to prevent both sides from going\r\nover the brink of the abyss that suddenly yawned. Along these principles\r\na solution can be secured that will be stable and satisfactory alike\r\nto employers, the workers and the community. The first essential step\r\nto a solution is knowledge of the ingredients that make up the Labour\r\nproblem, and there is no book, as far as I am aware, available to the\r\ngeneral reader that states the matter plainly from a wide and practical\r\nexperience quite as I have striven to do. That is my apology for\r\npublication of this book.\r\n\r\nMy criticisms, I trust, will leave no rancour; I have stated my views\r\nwith directness, but in words I have weighed, and there is nothing behind\r\nthem, for I am neither an employer nor a politician. I am but anxious to\r\nsee a brotherly, just and nation-saving solution of the problem. Labour\r\nand I have had many a fierce tussle in the past, but I think we have\r\nlearned to respect each other. No section of the community so revels\r\nin and honours straightforward and downright criticism as does Labour,\r\nprovided it is really honest and the critic is sincere. It is something\r\nto be able to say, after so much official controversy as I have had,\r\nthat on no occasion did we ever descend from discussing principles to\r\npersonalities. I hope this book may not contain a single involuntary\r\nlapse from that standard, as I count myself fortunate, in spite of acute\r\ndifferences in economic views, to enjoy the friendship of many persons,\r\nboth great and humble, in the Labour movement, a valued possession I\r\nwould not lightly jeopardize. It is with principles, and principles only,\r\nthat this book is concerned, and not with persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart I\r\n\r\nTHE LABOUR PARTY’S FALSE POLICY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE LABOUR PARTY’S CONSTITUTION AND ITS DEFECTS\r\n\r\n    Origin of the Labour Party—Reconstitution in 1918—The Trades\r\n    Union Congress—The National Joint Council—The Parliamentary\r\n    Labour Party—The Labour Party a Class Party—The Party’s Want of\r\n    Leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two great Labour organizations: the Trades Union Congress, with\r\nits Executive, the General Council, which represents the industrial wing;\r\nand the Labour Party, with its National Executive or Executive Committee,\r\nrepresenting the political wing. The distinction between industry and\r\npolitics—at no time kept clear—is fast disappearing.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrigin of the Labour Party\r\n\r\nThe Labour Party dates from 1900—when the Labour Representation\r\nCommittee was formed on the initiative of the Trades Union Congress,\r\nthe Independent Labour Party, the Social Democratic Federation, and the\r\nFabian Society. Of 15 Committee candidates who ran at the subsequent\r\nGeneral Election of 1900, 2 were returned—the late Mr. Keir Hardie and\r\nMr. Richard Bell—9 Trade Unionist members being also returned, but\r\nnot under the auspices of the Committee. Before 1900 prominent Trade\r\nUnionists had stood individually for Parliament, and had, from time to\r\ntime, been elected. The first effective steps had been taken in that\r\ndirection by the Labour Representation League established in 1869, after\r\nthe Reform Act of 1868. In 1874, 13 candidates went to election, and\r\nthe first two “Labour members” were elected, one being the late Right\r\nHon. Thomas Burt. In 1880, 3 were returned; in 1885,11; in 1892,14; in\r\n1895,12. The successful Labour candidates stood on an industrial and not\r\na “Socialist ticket”; where Socialists did stand they received scanty\r\nsupport. At the election of 1885, the Social Democratic Federation ran a\r\ncandidate in Kennington and one in Hampstead: the former polled only 32\r\nvotes, the latter 29.\r\n\r\nIn 1886, the Labour Representation League having been dissolved, the\r\nElectoral Labour Committee was constituted by the Trades Union Congress.\r\nIt soon fell under the influence of the Liberal Party, and this led to\r\nMr. Keir Hardie’s campaign, opened at the Swansea Trades Union Congress\r\nin 1887, for an independent Parliamentary Party representing Labour. Mr.\r\nKeir Hardie himself fought Mid-Lanark as an Independent Labour candidate\r\nin 1888 unsuccessfully, but was returned for South-West Ham in 1892. At\r\nhis instance the Independent Labour Party was founded in 1893; it sent\r\n28 candidates to the poll in 1895, with no success. But the political\r\nactivity of the Independent Labour Party soon roused the Trades Union\r\nCongress. In 1899, at the Plymouth Conference, the Congress passed a\r\nresolution directing its Parliamentary Committee to arrange a conference\r\nof Trade Unions, Co-operative and Socialist Societies, to secure the\r\nreturn of an increased number of Labour members to Parliament. As part of\r\nthe machinery the Labour Representation Committee was formed in 1900.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the Labour Representation Committee in 1900 was as\r\nfollows: 41 Trade Unions, with a membership of 353,070 members; 7 Trades\r\nCouncils; 3 Socialist Societies, adding a further membership of 22,861,\r\nmaking a total of 375,931. At bye-elections between the General Elections\r\nof 1900 and 1906, three prominent candidates of the Labour Representation\r\nCommittee were elected: Mr. (now Sir) David Shackleton for Clitheroe, the\r\nlate Mr. Will Crooks for Woolwich, and Mr. (now the Right Hon.) Arthur\r\nHenderson for Barnard Castle. The Newcastle Trades Union Congress of\r\n1903 passed a strong resolution enjoining political independence, and\r\ninstituted a parliamentary fund. At the General Election in 1906, out of\r\n50 candidates sponsored by the Labour Representation Committee, which\r\nin that year re-christened itself “the Labour Party,” 29 were elected.\r\nUnder the chairmanship of Mr. Keir Hardie, the Parliamentary Labour Party\r\nwas immediately established with all the paraphernalia of a separate\r\npolitical party in the House of Commons. At the General Election of\r\nJanuary 1910, out of 78 candidates, 40 were elected; at that of December\r\n1910, out of 56 candidates, 42 were elected; at that of December 1918,\r\nout of 392 candidates, 59 were elected. At the last election in 1918,\r\nwith a total vote in Great Britain of 9,690,109, 2,375,202 were polled by\r\nLabour.\r\n\r\n\r\nReconstitution in 1918\r\n\r\nAt the Labour Party Conference at Nottingham in January 1918, a revised\r\nconstitution was proposed, which was ultimately adopted in London at\r\nthe Party Conference on February 26 of the same year. The case for\r\nthe new constitution was put before the Nottingham Conference by the\r\nSecretary to the Executive Committee, the Right Hon. Arthur Henderson,\r\nin these words: “It was no use the Executive using anything in the\r\nnature of a social programme or talking about building up a new social\r\norder and reconstructing society until they had taken into very careful\r\nconsideration their present position as an organized political force.\r\nThey had done so, and came to the unanimous conclusion that Labour, as\r\npolitically organized in the existing circumstances, was altogether\r\ninadequate to the great task that lay immediately before it. They had\r\nnever in the proper sense claimed to be a national political party. This\r\nlimitation was inherited from the resolution carried at the Trades Union\r\nCongress in Plymouth in 1899. They were a political federation consisting\r\nof Trade Unions, Socialist bodies and Co-operative Societies, but in\r\nrecent years they had developed what were called Local Labour Parties.”\r\nMr. Henderson said the real question to be decided was whether, for\r\nthe purposes of best attaining political power and of so advancing its\r\nparty programme, the Labour Party should scrap the whole of its existing\r\npolitical machinery and build up a political organization from a new\r\nfoundation depending only upon individual membership. “Speaking as an old\r\nelectioneerer,” he continued, “he did not mind saying that if they had to\r\nbegin afresh that would be the ideal at which he would aim, but in view\r\nof the close proximity of a general election he could imagine no greater\r\nmistake than to attempt to create a new organization based solely upon\r\nindividual membership.” The Party ultimately decided to adhere to the\r\nexisting scheme of a central industrial federation, but to graft on to it\r\nsuch a form of electoral constituency organization, linked up with the\r\nLocal Labour Parties or Trades Councils, as would bring the federation\r\nand the constituencies into close contact with the Annual Conference and\r\nthe National Executive of the Labour Party.\r\n\r\nIn the new constitution the Party thus expressed its intention:\r\n\r\n    “(_a_) To organize and maintain in Parliament and the country\r\n    a Political Labour Party, and to ensure the establishment of\r\n    a Local Labour Party in every county constituency and every\r\n    parliamentary borough, with suitable divisional organization in\r\n    the separate constituencies of divided boroughs.\r\n\r\n    “(_b_) To secure for the producers, by hand or by brain,\r\n    the full fruits of their industry, and the most equitable\r\n    distribution thereof that may be possible upon the basis of\r\n    the common ownership of the means of production and the best\r\n    obtainable system of popular administration and control of each\r\n    industry or service.\r\n\r\n    “(_c_) Generally to promote the political, social and economic\r\n    emancipation of the people, and more particularly of those who\r\n    depend directly upon their own exertions by hand or by brain\r\n    for the means of life.\r\n\r\n    “(_d_) To co-operate with the Labour and Socialist\r\n    organizations in the Dominions and Dependencies with a view to\r\n    promoting the purposes of the Party, and to take common action\r\n    for the promotion of a higher standard of social and economic\r\n    life for the working population of the respective countries.\r\n\r\n    “(_e_) To co-operate with the Labour and Socialist\r\n    organizations in other countries, and to assist in organizing a\r\n    Federation of Nations for the maintenance of freedom and peace,\r\n    for the establishment of suitable machinery for the adjustment\r\n    and settlement of international disputes by conciliation or\r\n    judicial arbitration, and for such international legislation as\r\n    may be practicable.”\r\n\r\nThe new constitution maintains the Party as an industrial federation of\r\nTrade Unions, Socialist Societies, Trades Councils, and Local Labour\r\nParties; but it establishes the principle of individual membership of\r\nthe Party through membership of the local organization. Every man and\r\nwoman, therefore, may now join a Local Labour Party. It is intended\r\nto form a Labour Party in every parliamentary constituency, as a unit\r\nof organization to which Trade Union local branches and Local Trade\r\nCouncils, Co-operative, Socialist, and other such societies will be\r\naffiliated, and to which each individual local supporter of the Labour\r\nParty will adhere. Every candidate for Parliament must be chosen\r\nor approved by the local organization and accepted by the National\r\nExecutive. He must stand as a Labour candidate, and, if elected, must\r\nagree to act in harmony with the constitution and standing orders of the\r\nParty, and accept the decisions of Party meetings. He must include in his\r\nelectoral address those issues defined by the National Executive as the\r\nLabour Party’s programme for the election.\r\n\r\nThe official adherence of the Co-operative movement to the political\r\nLabour Party is rather interesting. For many years when motions were\r\nbrought forward in the Annual Co-operative Congress in favour of the\r\nCo-operative movement taking up political activity, these resolutions\r\nwere invariably rejected by overwhelming majorities. However, in 1918,\r\nat an emergency conference of the Co-operative movement in London on\r\nOctober 16 and 17, it was decided to take political action. The reasons\r\nwhich led the Co-operative movement to this decision were taxation\r\nof Co-operative dividends, the alleged neglect of the Government to\r\nmake greater use of the Co-operative movement in dealing with the\r\nnational food supply, and alleged unfair treatment of the staffs of the\r\ndistributive societies under the Military Service Acts.\r\n\r\nFor the year 1917, prior to its reconstitution, the Labour Party’s\r\nmembership was as follows:\r\n\r\n    123 Trade Unions, with a total membership of 2,415,383;\r\n    239 Trades Councils and Local Labour Parties;\r\n      3 Socialist Societies with a total membership of 47,140,\r\n\r\nmaking a total affiliated membership of 2,465,131, which also\r\nincluded the membership of the Co-operative and Women’s Labour League\r\naffiliations. For the year 1920, the membership of the Labour Party was\r\n122 Trade Unions, with a total membership of 4,317,537, 492[1] affiliated\r\nTrades Councils and Local Labour Parties, 5 Socialist Societies,\r\nrepresenting a membership of 42,270, making a total membership of\r\n4,359,807, which also included the membership of the Co-operative and\r\nWomen’s Labour League affiliations.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Societies are the Fabian Society, which, in 1921, returned\r\na membership of 1,770; the Herald League with a membership of 500;\r\nthe Independent Labour Party with a membership of 35,000; the Jewish\r\nSocialist Party (Poale Zion) with a membership of 3,000; the Social\r\nDemocratic Federation with a membership of 2,000.\r\n\r\nBy the accounts of the Party the total receipts for the year ending\r\nDecember 31, 1920, were £62,000 odd, of which £49,000 represented\r\naffiliation fees.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Trades Union Congress\r\n\r\nTurning from the Labour Party to the Trades Union Congress, “Labour’s\r\nAnnual Parliament,” this, when founded in 1868, consisted of 34\r\ndelegates, representing about 20 societies with an affiliated membership\r\nof 118,367. In 1919, although all Trade Unions were not included, it\r\nhad grown to 851 delegates, representing 266 Unions and an affiliated\r\nmembership of 5,283,676. In 1921 it consisted of 810 delegates\r\nrepresenting a membership of 6,417,910. It may now be taken to represent\r\nindustrially the organized labour of Great Britain, and has the largest\r\nTrade Union affiliated membership in the world.\r\n\r\nThe Trades Union Congress must be distinguished from the General\r\nFederation of Trade Unions which was created under its auspices in\r\n1899—now representing an affiliated membership of about 1½ millions—and\r\nthe chief object of which is to maintain Trade Union rights, and to\r\nassist financially or otherwise affiliated Unions involved in disputes\r\nwith employers or employers’ organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe National Joint Council\r\n\r\nA scheme for co-ordination of Labour forces was recently worked out by a\r\nJoint Co-ordination Committee representing the Parliamentary Committee\r\nof the Trades Union Congress and the Executive Committee of the Labour\r\nParty. A National Joint Council has been constituted representing the\r\nGeneral Council of the Trades Union Congress, the Executive Committee of\r\nthe Labour Party and the Parliamentary Labour Party. Its duties are to\r\nconsider all questions affecting the Labour movement as a whole, and to\r\nmake provision for immediate action on questions of national emergency,\r\nand to endeavour to secure a common policy and joint action, whether\r\nby legislation or otherwise, on all questions affecting the workers as\r\nproducers, consumers or citizens. The expenditure of the Council is met\r\nin equal proportions by the General Council of the Trades Union Congress\r\nand the Executive Committee of the Labour Party. The scheme also provides\r\nfor the establishment, under joint control of the General Council and\r\nof the National Executive, of four departments organized to deal with\r\nresearch and information, international affairs, publicity and legal\r\nmatters. In the memorandum which recommended the scheme for the National\r\nJoint Committee, it was pointed out that in view of the enormous growth\r\nof the Labour movement and the importance of presenting a united front\r\nupon the great problems which lie before it, the need for co-ordination\r\nwas becoming daily more important. “If Labour is to realize its ideals it\r\nmust formulate a common policy and secure the maximum of common action.\r\nThe effectiveness of the Labour movement has in the past been dissipated\r\nby overlapping functions, by duplication of effort, and by confusion\r\narising from conflicting policies.” The scheme is described as one which\r\nenables Labour to speak with one voice on all questions of national\r\nimportance, and to pursue one uniform policy in support of its common\r\nends.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Parliamentary Labour Party\r\n\r\nWhat the Parliamentary Labour Party is, must also be explained. In 1906,\r\n29 Labour members were, we have seen, returned to Parliament; they were\r\nthen constituted into a distinct Parliamentary party, Mr. J. Keir Hardie,\r\nM.P., being elected Chairman, and a Vice-Chairman, Secretary and Whips\r\nbeing also appointed. It is the practice of the Parliamentary Party at\r\nthe beginning of each session to review the resolutions passed at the\r\nvarious conferences of the Labour Party and to take them as indicating\r\nthe principles on which the Parliamentary Party should proceed. About\r\nthe commencement of the session there is a joint meeting between the\r\nParliamentary Party and the National Executive of the Labour Party for\r\nthe purposes of deciding the various objects in respect of which Bills\r\nshould be introduced into Parliament or motions made. A general review of\r\nthe Parliamentary Labour Party’s activity since 1906 will be found in the\r\n_Labour Year Books_ for 1916 and 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Labour Party, a Class Party\r\n\r\nThe Labour Party claims to be “the true national democratic party” in\r\nchallenge of the old party system. It recommends itself to the electorate\r\nas “the party of the producers, whose labour of hand and brain provides\r\nthe necessities of life for all and dignifies and elevates human\r\nexistence,” “Producers have been robbed,” it says, “of the major parts of\r\nthe fruits of their industry under the individualist system of capitalist\r\nproduction; and that is justification for the Party’s claims.”\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the Labour Party when examined definitely disproves\r\nthe contention that the Party either is or ever can be, while that\r\nconstitution lasts, a national democratic political party. By a political\r\nparty one understands, according to our British traditions, a party whose\r\nmembers are united in support of common political principles, and not a\r\nparty whose object is to advance its own material interests. Whatever the\r\nLabour Party may call itself, it is in fact a class party—that appears\r\nclearly from its history. Up to 1900, when the Labour Representation\r\nCommittee was constituted, it was definitely Trade Unionist in its\r\norganization. In 1900, as has been shown, seven local Trades Councils\r\nwere, for the first time, brought in along with three Socialist\r\nSocieties, but they only accounted for 22,861 out of 375,931 affiliated\r\nmembership. Between 1900 and the revision of the constitution in 1918,\r\nthe Party was obviously still comprised, in the main, of industrial\r\nTrade Unionists. Individual members were, as has been explained,\r\nnominally introduced into the Party in 1918, by throwing membership\r\nopen to members of Local Labour Parties and Trade Councils. It is\r\nimpossible, because the Labour Party has not the figures itself, to give\r\nany comparison between the number of individual members of Local Labour\r\nParties and Trades Councils who are not Trade Unionists and the 4,317,537\r\nmembers of the affiliated Trade Unions in 1920. But one thing is quite\r\nclear—the individual member is wholly swamped by the Trade Unions’\r\nmembership and power. If the accounts of the Labour Party are examined\r\nfor 1920, it will be found that of the total affiliation fees of £49,000,\r\nonly about £1,382 is contributed by Trades Councils and Local Labour\r\nParties, which include a certain number of individual members, and £524\r\nfrom five Socialist bodies; so that practically the whole of the income\r\nof the Labour Party comes from the Trade Unions; they naturally exercise\r\nthe right to dictate policy and run the Party machine. When it comes to\r\nthe selection of the local Parliamentary candidate, if a Local Labour\r\nParty or Trades Council runs a candidate they must themselves provide for\r\nthe whole expenses of the election, and that puts a serious difficulty in\r\ntheir way; on the other hand, if a Trade Union selects a candidate it is\r\nenabled, by means of its parliamentary levy, to pay the whole costs of\r\nhis election. As a result, in the great number of cases, Trade Unionist\r\ncandidates, with the financial backing of their Unions, are accepted as\r\nLocal Labour candidates—true carpet-baggers in the real sense of the\r\nterm, and probably wholly unknown to the district. One may learn from\r\nexperience the basis on which the Trade Unions select candidates. It is\r\nconsidered a matter of prime importance by every Union to have members\r\nof its own in Parliament, and its first consideration is whether he\r\nis a sound and trusty member of his particular organization. As it is\r\nconsidered essential that only men should be selected by a Union who have\r\nan intimate knowledge of the working of the Union, the branch secretary\r\nor the district delegate or district secretary or a member of the\r\nexecutive or the general secretary of the Union is generally chosen, and\r\nhe, it should be noted, is picked out, not for his political experience\r\nor enthusiasm, but as a trusty protagonist of his own trade body; he,\r\ntherefore, goes into Parliament primarily to advance the industrial\r\ninterests of his own particular Union and, so far as is compatible with\r\nthat, of Labour in general. This needs clearly to be understood by the\r\ngeneral public of this country. The Labour Party has no right to protest\r\nagainst those who would institute a campaign against it on the ground\r\nthat the Labour movement, as at present constituted, is definitely class\r\nand sectarian in its objects. There is ample justification for that\r\nattack in the Labour Party’s own pamphlet _Trade Unionism and Political\r\nAction_. The Labour Party will not for a very long time, if ever, be\r\na Party solely of individual membership; that would mean that the\r\nParty would have to cut itself off from the enforced contributions of\r\naffiliated Trade Unions, and rely upon the voluntary contributions of its\r\nindividual members.\r\n\r\nThe Labour Party prides itself on being the party of brotherhood—an\r\nadmirable sentiment, one too seldom encountered in the industrial world\r\nto-day. We are entitled to test such a profession by examining to what\r\nextent the spirit of fraternity operates amongst the 122 different Trade\r\nUnions which are members of the Party. If any one part of the community\r\nis torn by internecine strife it most certainly is the Trade Union\r\nsection. Consider for example the question of demarcation of work. If\r\nwe take trades like those of the shipwrights and the joiners, they are\r\nseparated by thin divisions; so much so that in one port shipwrights\r\ndo work which in another port is done by joiners. If anywhere there is\r\nthe least invasion by one trade into the work of the other the most\r\nunbrotherly struggles ensue, resulting almost invariably in one Union\r\nor the other calling their respective members out and so stopping\r\nwork in the port. Time after time during the war I had the fitting\r\nout or refitting of urgently needed vessels held up by these kinds of\r\nfratricidal disputes. Again, take trades like engineers, members of the\r\nAmalgamated Engineering Union, and plumbers, members of the Plumbers’\r\nUnion—between them there is the most bitter animosity. Certain pipes on\r\nboard ship are, according to the custom of the port, bent and fitted\r\nby the members of one Union, and certain other pipes, possibly of the\r\nsame material but a little larger or smaller, or of the same size but\r\nof a different material, are bent and fitted by members of the other\r\nUnion. After the Jutland fight, I had most vital naval repairs held\r\nup owing to the whole of the engineers in one large district going on\r\nstrike because plumbers had been put on to bore a few holes in the outer\r\ncasings of searchlights, as there were no available engineers to do the\r\nwork. Instances might be multiplied indefinitely of this industrial\r\nenmity which is to form the basis of the new political brotherhood. We\r\nhave again the perennial dispute between the Amalgamated Engineering\r\nUnion and the National Union of Railwaymen in respect of the men in the\r\nrailway engineering shops, or the acrimonious controversy, growing in\r\nintensity, between the General Workers’ Union, representing the unskilled\r\nor semi-skilled men, and the Amalgamated Engineering Union. The former\r\nUnion asserts the right of an engineering employer to promote its members\r\nfrom the job of general labourer “on the floor” to work semi-automatic\r\nor other similar machines “in the shop,” which without question the man\r\nis usually quite competent to do; on the other hand the Amalgamated\r\nEngineering Union, or its district committee, claims that no person,\r\nhowever competent, can be put on to work any of those machines unless\r\nhe is a member of the Amalgamated Engineering Union and receives in\r\nrespect of the work the prescribed rates of pay. So then we have this\r\ncurious paradox that the Labour Party, which knows that there exists,\r\nand is quite incapable of extinguishing, this spirit of industrial\r\nhostility amongst the various sections of its Trade Union membership,\r\nstill professes its ability to instil and enforce the spirit of social\r\nbrotherhood throughout the whole electorate. “By their works ye shall\r\nknow them,” The truth of the matter is that the sole cohesive political\r\nforce which the Labour Party can exert, apart from the Trade Unions’\r\nindustrial compulsion on their members, are the promises of better times,\r\nless work, more time for leisure, more money to spend, by the abolition\r\nof what it calls the “capitalistic” or private employer, and the\r\nsuggestion that thereby there will be some fund of money made available\r\nfor distribution amongst the members of the Party.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Party’s Want of Leadership\r\n\r\nWhat about the Labour Party’s leaders? Labour undoubtedly possesses\r\noutstanding men of tried experience, ability and judgment, and others,\r\nuntried as yet, but of equal capacity and ability. I had the good\r\nfortune during the war of serving at different times directly under\r\nthe Right Hon. A. Henderson, the Right Hon. G. N. Barnes, the Right\r\nHon. John Hodge, and the Right Hon. G. H. Roberts. I had also the\r\nopportunity of comparing their ministerial gifts with those of other\r\nCabinet Ministers and Ministers of State. The Labour Ministers did not\r\nsuffer from the comparison; their respective records are unsurpassed for\r\nforesight, decision, balance of judgment, statesmanship, organizing and\r\nadministrative ability, power of evoking the loyalty of their departments\r\nand commanding the confidence of the public. The weakness of a Labour\r\nGovernment will assuredly not lie in the personnel of its Ministers _if_\r\nthey lead—but will they be allowed to lead? So far the signs are not\r\nencouraging.\r\n\r\nNobody who has not seen the working of the Trade Union machine from\r\ninside has the remotest conception of the difficulties of the Trade\r\nUnion leader, or of the tyranny to which he is subject. He is in the\r\nfirst instance usually a paid official of his Union, and if he takes or\r\nadvocates any political or parliamentary action which is considered in\r\nany way to invade or infringe the trade rights and privileges of his\r\nUnion, he will assuredly fall from office at the next Union election.\r\nEvery leader must, therefore, keep one eye upon his own position and the\r\nother upon the political principle which he is disposed to advocate. This\r\nmakes it exceedingly difficult for any Labour leader to take a strong\r\nindependent line which may excite even the suspicions of ill-informed\r\nsections of his followers, still less their hostile opposition. I saw\r\nover and over again during the war how frequently large committees of\r\nTrade Unionist leaders would agree with the Government in London on the\r\nadoption of some measure—it may have been for the suspension of a trade\r\ncustom in order to expedite production—and how it became quite impossible\r\nto obtain their active assistance afterwards to put the agreement into\r\noperation among their members, with the notable exception of some\r\nfew whose sturdy independence I never ceased to admire. But these,\r\nunfortunately, perhaps as the result of their qualities, have little\r\ninfluence in political Labour.\r\n\r\nThere is another aspect: the great unwritten law of the Labour movement\r\nis solidarity at any price, and it frequently happens that the leaders,\r\nin order to avoid splitting the Party, will adopt, against their\r\nown better judgment, the proposals of extremists rather than face\r\ndisruption. The action of constitutionalists in the Labour movement, in\r\nultimately taking part in the recent formation of the Council of Action,\r\nnotwithstanding their own earlier protests, is a case in point.\r\n\r\nNo political party is immune from intrigue or from cabals and\r\nconspiracies against its accepted leaders, but it is not an exaggeration\r\nto say that the Labour movement is more impregnated than any other\r\nmovement in this country with those unlovely tendencies. You have only to\r\nfollow the course of a branch committee or a district committee election,\r\nor the election of an executive committee-man or general secretary of a\r\nTrade Union, to realize the prevalence and power of personal jealousies.\r\nThis is notoriously so in the political Labour world. Nothing cuts so\r\ndeeply at the roots of independent leadership as incessant conspiracy and\r\nintrigue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nAN OUTLINE OF THE LABOUR PARTY’S GENERAL POLICY\r\n\r\n    A National Minimum Standard of Living—Effective Personal\r\n    Freedom—Socialization of Land and Industry—A Revolution\r\n    in Public Finance—The Surplus Wealth for the Common\r\n    Good—International Co-operation—No Protective Tariffs—Freedom\r\n    of International Trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the Labour Party’s industrial policy, it is necessary to\r\nknow, at least in outline, the general policy of which the former is\r\na part. As the basis of all social reform it is contended that “the\r\nindividualistic system of capitalist production based on the private\r\nownership and competitive administration of land and capital, with\r\nits reckless profiteering and wage slavery, its glorification of the\r\nunhampered struggle for the means of life, and its hypocritical pretence\r\nof the survival of the fittest, must go.” With it must be eradicated\r\nthe “monstrous inequality of circumstances which it produces, and the\r\ndegradation and brutalization, both moral and spiritual, resulting\r\nfrom it”—“along with it must disappear the present political system,\r\nenshrining the ideas in which the capitalistic system naturally\r\nfinds expression.” The Labour Party advances a new basis of social\r\nreorganization; it proposes to reconstruct society on four pillars\r\nresting upon the common foundation of “the democratic control of\r\nsociety in all its activities.” These four pillars are: “(1) Universal\r\nenforcement of the national minimum; (2) the democratic control of\r\nindustry; (3) a revolution in national finance; and (4) the surplus\r\nwealth for the common good.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA National Minimum Standard of Living\r\n\r\nThe principle of the national minimum, it is claimed, contrasts sharply\r\nwith the principle of the capitalistic system, expressed either by\r\nLiberal or Conservative policy. By the national minimum is meant the\r\nassurance for every member of the community of a standard of life\r\nconferring a reasonable minimum of health, education, leisure and\r\nsubsistence. One chief element is a legal minimum wage, to be revised\r\naccording to the level of current prices. As part of this national\r\nminimum, the ambiguous principle of “equal pay for equal work” is\r\npostulated in all occupations in which both sexes are engaged. The\r\nParty also demands that the Government shall prevent unemployment, and\r\nshould it fail to secure for every willing worker a suitable situation\r\nat the standard rate of wages, it shall provide such a worker with\r\nmaintenance in the form of out-of-work benefit paid through his Trade\r\nUnion. The National Unemployment Insurance Scheme should, it is insisted,\r\nbe extended, on a non-contributory basis, to every occupation. What is\r\naffirmed as a fundamental is that “in one way or another remunerative\r\nemployment or honourable maintenance must be found for every willing\r\nworker by hand or by brain in bad times as well as in good.” Complete\r\nprovision against involuntary destitution in sickness and in health, in\r\ngood times and in bad, must be assured for every member of the community.\r\n\r\n\r\nEffective Personal Freedom\r\n\r\nDemocracy, the Labour Party asserts, implies effective personal freedom,\r\nand involves the complete removal of all war-time restrictions on liberty\r\nof speech, publication, press, travel, choice of residence, kind of\r\nemployment, and especially of any obligation for military service. These\r\nsentiments, strange to say, come from the Party which denies the right of\r\nthe non-Union operative to work; and which claims for Trade Unions the\r\nright to picket and the other privileges afforded by the Trade Disputes\r\nAct, 1906. On the same principle, complete political rights are demanded\r\nfor every adult irrespective of sex, and for every minority, the right\r\nto full proportionate representation in Parliament. The abolition of the\r\nHouse of Lords is demanded, with the elimination from any new second\r\nChamber of any qualification based on heredity. Separate statutory\r\nlegislative assemblies are claimed for Scotland, Wales and England, with\r\nautonomous administration in local matters; Parliament at Westminster to\r\nbe merely a Federal Assembly for Great Britain, controlling the Ministers\r\nresponsible for departments of central government; these Ministers,\r\nwith others representing the Dominions and India, to form a Cabinet for\r\nfederal affairs of the British Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nSocialization of Land and Industry\r\n\r\nThe Labour Party stands for the removal from industry of the private\r\nemployer and the capitalist, the introduction of a new “scientific\r\nre-organization of the national industries,” purged from the degradation\r\nof individual profiteering, and regenerated on the basis of the common\r\nownership of the means of production; the equitable sharing of the output\r\namong all who assist in any capacity in production; and the adoption of\r\n“democratic control of industry.”\r\n\r\nAccordingly the Labour Party would immediately establish the common\r\nownership of land, the common ownership and administration of railways\r\nand canals, and their consolidation with harbours, roads, posts,\r\ntelegraphs, and the ocean-going steamer lines into a national service\r\nof Communication and Transport, to be worked “unhampered by capitalist,\r\nprivate or purely local interests, and with a steadily increasing\r\nparticipation of the organized workers in the management, both central\r\nand local, exclusively for the common good.” So also it would erect a\r\nscore of national central electrical generating stations, with which all\r\nmunicipal electrical plants would be connected for distribution purposes.\r\nFor similar reasons, the Party demands the immediate nationalization of\r\ncoal-mines, with steadily increasing participation in the management,\r\nboth central and local, of the various grades of persons employed;\r\nand insists that the retail distribution of household coal should\r\nbe undertaken by the municipal authorities or county councils, the\r\npurpose to be achieved being the distribution in every local district\r\nof household coal of standard quality at a fixed and uniform price\r\n“as unalterable as the penny postage stamp.” The State expropriation\r\nof profit-making industrial insurance companies is urged, also the\r\nassumption by Government of the whole business of life insurance. Much\r\nstress is laid upon the alleged necessity that Government should take\r\nthe manufacture and retailing of intoxicants out of the hands of persons\r\nwho find profit in promoting the utmost possible consumption of them,\r\nand that each local authority should deal with “the trade” within its\r\ndistrict on the basis of local veto or limitation of licences or other\r\nsystem of regulation.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly alive to the evils of centralization and the restrictions of\r\nbureaucracy, the Party claims a free hand for local authorities, assisted\r\nby grants-in-aid from Government sources, to extend widely the scope of\r\nmunicipal enterprise. Local authorities should, it is asserted, not only\r\nretail coal, but supply milk, and engage in other similar spheres of\r\ntrade. All members of local bodies ought, it is said, to receive their\r\nnecessary travelling expenses, and also be paid for time spent by them on\r\nthe public service.\r\n\r\nThe Labour Party would re-organize the whole educational system from\r\nthe nursery school to the university “on the basis of social equality”;\r\n“each educational institution, irrespective of social class or wealth,\r\nto be open to every member of the community on terms within his\r\nreach”—everything in the nature of military training to be absolutely\r\nprohibited. In regard to public health, the Labour Party holds that\r\nGovernment should build at the national expense the requisite number of\r\ndwelling houses, spacious and healthy, each having four or five rooms,\r\nlarder, scullery, cupboards, and fitted bath, spaced not more than ten or\r\ntwelve to the acre, and provided with a garden. National provision for\r\nthe prevention and treatment of disease, and the care of orphans, infirm,\r\nincapacitated, and aged persons is also included as an indispensable part\r\nof Labour’s policy.\r\n\r\nIn regard to agriculture and rural life, the Party has formulated a\r\nnumber of proposals based on the Government’s immediately assuming\r\ncontrol of the nation’s agricultural land, and—\r\n\r\n    “ensuring its utilization, not for rent, not for game, not\r\n    for the social amenity of a small social class, not even for\r\n    obtaining the largest percentage on the capital employed, but\r\n    solely with a view to the production of the largest proportion\r\n    of the food-stuffs required by the population of these\r\n    islands under conditions allowing of a good life to the rural\r\n    population with complete security for the farmers’ enterprise,\r\n    yet not requiring the consumer to pay a price exceeding that\r\n    for which food-stuffs can be brought from other lands.”\r\n\r\nThe means proposed to attain this end are large national farms, small\r\nholdings made accessible to practical agriculturists, municipal\r\nagricultural enterprises, and farms let to Co-operative Societies and\r\nother approved tenants, under a national guarantee against losses due\r\nto bad seasons. All distribution of agricultural food-stuffs—from milk\r\nand vegetables up to bread and meat—is to be taken out of the hands of\r\ndealers and shopkeepers, and is to be effected by Co-operative Societies\r\nand local authorities “with equitable compensation for all interests\r\nexpropriated or displaced.”\r\n\r\nThe Labour Party also advocates Government importation of raw materials\r\nand food-commodities, and Government control of the shipping, woollen,\r\nclothing, milling, and other similar industries; the rationing both of\r\nraw material and of food commodities, and the fixing of all prices on the\r\nbasis of accurate costing, so as to eliminate profiteering. It is, the\r\nLabour Party says—\r\n\r\n    “just as much the function of Government, and just as necessary\r\n    a part of the democratic regulation of industry to safeguard\r\n    the interests of the community as a whole and those of grades\r\n    and classes of private consumers in the matter of prices, as it\r\n    is by the Factory and Trade Board Acts to protect the rights\r\n    of the wage-earning producers in the matter of wages, hours\r\n    of labour and sanitation, or by the organized police force to\r\n    protect the householder from the burglar.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA Revolution in Public Finance\r\n\r\nA complete revolution in national finance is overdue, in the opinion\r\nof the Labour Party. Too long, it says, has our national finance been\r\nregulated on a basis opposed to the teaching of political economy,\r\naccording to the views of the possessing classes and the desire for\r\nprofits of the financiers. There ought to be such a system of taxation\r\n“as will secure all the necessary revenue to the Government without\r\nencroaching on the prescribed national minimum standard of life of any\r\nfamily, without hampering production or discouraging any useful personal\r\neffort, and with the closest possible approximation to equality of\r\nsacrifice.” The Labour Party accordingly would institute direct taxation\r\nof all incomes exceeding the necessary cost of family maintenance, and\r\nthe direct taxation of private fortunes both during life and at death\r\nfor the redemption of the National Debt. It opposes taxation calculated\r\nto increase the price of food or necessaries of life, and holds that\r\nindirect taxation of commodities, whether by customs or excise, should be\r\nlimited to “luxuries.” It would retain and increase the excess-profits\r\ntax and, until nationalization of minerals, the mineral-rights duty.\r\nThe unearned increment of urban land and mineral values it would divert\r\nby taxation wholly into the public exchequer. Death duties would be\r\nregraduated and heavily increased, so as to turn into the national\r\ncoffers all the wealth of every person deceased in excess of a quite\r\nmoderate amount to be left for family provision. In addition, the Labour\r\nParty stands for “conscription of wealth,” described as “a capital levy,\r\nchargeable, like death duties, on all property, with exemption of the\r\nsmallest savings up to £1,000, but rising rapidly in percentage with the\r\nvalue of the property, for the purpose of freeing the nation of as large\r\nan amount as possible of its present load of interest-bearing debt.”\r\nCo-operative Societies would be left entirely free from this levy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Surplus Wealth for the Common Good\r\n\r\nThe fourth principle of the Labour Party’s policy of social\r\nreconstruction is “the diversion to the common good of the surplus over\r\nthe expenditure required for the maintenance of the national minimum of\r\nlife.” This surplus is said to be embodied in the riches of the mines,\r\nthe rental value of lands superior to the margin of cultivation, the\r\nextra profits of fortunate capitalists, now alleged to be absorbed by\r\nindividual proprietors, and devoted to the senseless luxury of the idle\r\nrich. It is to be secured by nationalization and municipalization, and by\r\nsteeply graduated taxation of private income and riches. From it is to be\r\ndrawn the new capital which the community day by day will require for the\r\nperpetual improvement and increase of its various enterprises, and for\r\nwhich it is said to be dependent now on the usury-exacting financier.\r\n\r\n    “It is in this proposal for the appropriation of every surplus\r\n    for the common good—in the vision of its resolute use for\r\n    the building up of the community as a whole instead of for\r\n    the magnification of individual fortunes—that the Labour\r\n    Party, as the Party of the producers by hand or by brain,\r\n    most distinctively marks itself off from the older political\r\n    parties, standing as these do essentially for the maintenance\r\n    unimpaired of the perpetual private mortgage upon the annual\r\n    product of the nation that is involved in the individual\r\n    ownership of land and capital.”\r\n\r\n\r\nInternational Co-operation\r\n\r\nFrom Labour’s home policy we turn to foreign affairs. Its international\r\naims are “peace and co-operation between nations; the avoidance\r\nof anything making for international hostility; the development\r\nof international co-operation in the League of Nations,” and “an\r\never-increasing intercourse, a constantly developing exchange of\r\ncommodities, a steadily growing mutual understanding, a continually\r\nexpanding friendly co-operation among all the peoples of the world.”\r\n“Imperialism,” defined to mean extension of empire over countries without\r\nreference to the wishes of the inhabitants of those countries, is\r\nrepudiated as rooted in capitalism, and springing only from a desire for\r\nprofits and for selfish exploitation of the natural resources belonging\r\nsolely to those inhabitants. “Protectionism” in any form, whether by\r\nprohibitions on imports, embargoes, tariffs, differential shipping or\r\nrailway rates, for the purpose of limiting the amount or restricting\r\nthe free flow of foreign commodities into this country, is unreservedly\r\ncondemned. Protection for the benefit of a particular trade, or all\r\ntrades, while it may conduce to the immediate advantage of Labour, is\r\npresumed to operate to the greater ultimate advantage of the capitalist,\r\nand to strengthen his position. Anything tending to such a result is\r\n“contrary to the true interests of Labour.” Protection is said to lead to\r\ncapitalistic rings, combinations and trusts, higher prices, diminished\r\nconsumption, reduced employment. This being so, Labour favours the free\r\nimportation of all foreign goods, and their sale at rates as low as are\r\nconsistent with their manufacture under unsweated labour conditions in\r\ntheir land of origin.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Protective Tariffs\r\n\r\nAll tariffs, especially if differential, must, so Labour contends,\r\ninevitably create international friction, retaliation, enmity, and\r\nultimately active hostilities, and are to be more especially discarded,\r\ninasmuch as they are the favourite instrument of capitalistic groups\r\neager to make profits out of international ruptures. Labour accordingly\r\nobjects to the protection of key industries for purposes of national\r\nsafety. “It is impossible to make either the British Empire or the\r\nBritish Isles self-contained or self-supporting. Even if practicable,\r\nthe policy of self-sufficiency would indicate a provocative intention\r\nto maintain a national condition of perpetual preparation for war.”\r\nTherefore, except so far as is necessary to avoid the spread of disease\r\nor prevention of accidents, there must be no restriction on the transit\r\nor importation of any commodity. Imperial preference is likewise rejected\r\nas a selfish attempt to reserve for the inhabitants of the British Empire\r\nthe raw materials and markets of the Empire, a course incompatible with\r\nany kind of lasting peace, having regard to the resentment it would\r\nprovoke amongst the nations excluded from participating in these raw\r\nmaterials or from supplying our imperial markets. Labour calls for “the\r\nopen door” in all our Colonies and Dependencies, and in “non-adult\r\ncountries,” meaning by this term “exploitable countries” like China and\r\nAfrica. The position of the capitalist has been so undermined by Labour’s\r\nattack at home that capital, in Labour’s opinion, is now making its\r\nreal profits and consolidating its power by expropriating natives, and\r\ncompelling them to work for low wages.\r\n\r\n\r\nFreedom of International Trade\r\n\r\nIn order to free Europe from “the rivalries of\r\nCapitalism—Imperialism—Protectionism, which poisoned international\r\nrelations between 1880-1914,” Labour desires to see an economic side\r\nof the League of Nations developed so as to secure the removal of\r\nall economic barriers and maintain equality of trade conditions. But\r\nsurely it was Labour itself that called loudest for self-determination,\r\nwhich has so grievously impaired the economic restoration of Europe. A\r\nWorld Economic Council of the League ought to apportion the supplies\r\nof food-commodities and raw materials and maintain credit in the\r\nvarious countries so as to ensure fair allocation of raw materials,\r\nthe furtherance of production, the development of international lines\r\nof communication, and the prevention of exploitation by trusts. As\r\nan alternative to “the present profit-making capitalistic economic\r\nsystem,” Labour proposes to use for purposes of international trade, an\r\norganization on a world-wide basis of the different national Co-operative\r\nmovements. So long as foreign trade remains under the control of the\r\ncompetitive and capitalistic system, Labour asserts that its general\r\ninternational aims can never be attained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE LABOUR PARTY’S ADOPTION OF SOCIALISM\r\n\r\nI. MEANING OF SOCIALISM\r\n\r\n    The Common Characteristics of all Socialistic Creeds—State\r\n    Socialism—Syndicalism—National Guildism—Nationalization and\r\n    Democratic Control.\r\n\r\n\r\nSocialism is too amorphous to admit of any workable definition. Each\r\nage exhibits schools of thought, industrial and philosophic, which\r\ndefine Socialism in different ways according to contemporary political\r\ncircumstances, economic conditions and industrial tendencies or their\r\ninterpretation of them. There is no more interesting study than to trace\r\nout the variant meanings of “Socialist” from its first appearance in the\r\n_Co-operative Magazine_ of November 1827 up to the present time, and to\r\nnote its successive contractions and extensions in political, ethical,\r\neconomic and social implications as decade succeeded to decade.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Common Characteristics of all Socialistic Creeds\r\n\r\nBut certain brands of Socialism can be described if not defined. The one\r\ncommon characteristic is abolition of the “capitalistic organization”\r\nof industry. If we call this _A_, then we can say that all schemes of\r\nSocialism can be reduced to the general formula _A_ + _x_, where _x_ is a\r\nsymbol standing for a very large number of variables which comprise the\r\nmethods by which the capitalist is to be extinguished; the terms on which\r\nthe present capitalists will be compensated or otherwise expropriated;\r\nthe persons or authority in whom the means of production—and probably\r\nthere should be added distribution and exchange—will be vested; the\r\npersons or body to be responsible for the organization of industry and\r\nfor its control; the means by which capital will be found and prices\r\nregulated; the relation in which the new industrial system will stand\r\nto the community, and the various socialized industries to one another.\r\nThese are the practical points to which attention should be directed\r\nrather than academic definitions.\r\n\r\nOf the term “capitalism” and what is implied by it all kinds of\r\ndefinitions are current. Socialists of different schools have their\r\nown definitions embellished with epithets which vary in virulence\r\naccording to their particular trend of thought. Employers too have\r\ntheir definitions, but it will be sufficient for our purposes if we\r\ntake capitalism to mean the existing scheme of industrial organization.\r\nThe basic vices of capitalism, according to all Socialists, are that it\r\nis a system under which the owner of the capital employed in industry\r\npossesses and controls the whole business of production and sale of the\r\noutput, buying, just as he buys raw materials for his business, the\r\nlabour power of the workman, paying him as little for it as possible,\r\nand that in the form of a wage merely in respect of the time he is at\r\nwork; a system under which the employer maintains a reserve of unemployed\r\nlabour in order to provide for the variations in trade, while recognizing\r\nno responsibility in respect of the workman at times when the employer\r\ncannot or is not prepared to provide him with work. Under such conditions\r\nthe workman is said to occupy a quasi-servile status, to be a wage-slave\r\nand entitled to no voice at all in the control of the industry. That,\r\nwithout the usual garnish of abuse, is probably a fair description of the\r\npresent organization of industry as it is envisaged by the Socialist.\r\nThe two great incidents of capitalism which the Socialist therefore\r\nseeks to eradicate are: the private ownership of land and capital; and\r\nthe employment on a wage-basis of hired labour. If only capitalism could\r\nbe abolished the workman would no longer see his employer and other\r\ncapitalists appropriating, in the shape of rent and interest and profits,\r\nall the value of the product which the labourer is said to create over\r\nand above the amount of his wages.\r\n\r\nTo capitalism, it is customary, and, indeed, necessary for his argument,\r\nfor the Socialist to attribute all the ills from which industry\r\nsuffers and most evils to which the community is heir. With the exit\r\nof capitalism the Socialist says that unemployment would disappear\r\nand adequate maintenance be secured for sickness, old age and other\r\nincapacity, equality of opportunity afforded to all, full scope provided\r\nfor individual expression and development, and a universal millennium\r\ninaugurated. In the minds of some Socialists there seems no limit\r\nwhatsoever to the mephitic influence of capitalism. Dr. Shadwell, in his\r\ndiscerning articles in _The Times_[2] on “The Revolutionary Movement in\r\nGreat Britain,” mentions that the _Daily Herald_ of February 2, 1921,\r\nfound the cause of influenza in capitalism, and argued that unless the\r\nlatter is destroyed it will destroy mankind; conversely Dr. Shadwell\r\nlogically suggested we may assume that if capitalism is abolished\r\ninfluenza will disappear!\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to distinguish the principal schools of\r\nSocialism that exist to-day. One will not find them formulating their\r\nprinciples as crisply as I set them out. My object is merely to indicate\r\nthe main outlines.\r\n\r\n\r\nState Socialism\r\n\r\nFirst we have the State Socialist who advocates that the State should\r\nacquire, as he generally says, the means of production, distribution and\r\nexchange, or, to reduce it to practical terms, land and the national\r\nindustries. Taking, for example, a concrete case—the railway industry—the\r\nState would take over all the railway undertakings in the country from\r\nthe various companies of shareholders who now own them and, under most\r\nschemes of State Socialism, would compensate the shareholders by paying\r\nthem, in State securities, something approaching the capital value of\r\nthe net maintainable revenue of the undertakings. Under this system the\r\nState steps into the shoes of the original owners of the railways and\r\nacts as the employer controlling the industry and employing the workmen\r\njust as the private owners previously did. The industry would be run by\r\na Government Department in Whitehall and, the State Socialist says, will\r\nbe run in the interests of the community and not for private profit,\r\ninasmuch as the Government Department is, through its ministerial head,\r\nresponsible to Parliament, which represents the community.\r\n\r\n\r\nSyndicalism\r\n\r\nThe next school is that of Syndicalism, which, curiously enough, was\r\nreally in its origin a British conception evolved in the revolutionary\r\nphase of the Chartist movement, but afterwards touched up and elaborated\r\nby Continental Socialists, especially in France, as by G. Sorel. Under\r\nthis system, the private owner would be evicted by the workers, who\r\nwould form some consolidated body, usually in the shape of an industrial\r\nUnion, including all persons concerned in the operation of the industry,\r\nand that body would carry on the industry solely in the interests of\r\nthe workers. Possession of the industry would be secured by the workers\r\nseizing the political power in the State, or, as is more generally\r\nadvocated, by direct pressure of such a kind, in the form of a general\r\nstrike or otherwise, as would enable the workers in all industries by\r\nconcerted action to seize the means of production. Regarding, as the\r\nSyndicalist does, the capitalist as an idle and useless parasite who\r\nbattens on the labour of the workers, no compensation would be paid\r\nto owners. The Syndicalist has not quite made up his mind whether he\r\nwill include the technical and administrative staff in the industrial\r\nUnion which will own and operate each industry, nor has he worked out\r\nthe relation to the State of individual industries or industry as a\r\nwhole.[3] Most Syndicalists assume that the State and its legislative,\r\nadministrative and executive organizations, as we know it, will cease to\r\nfunction and come to an end under a syndicalistic regime, and that the\r\ncountry will be governed by some organization representing the workers as\r\na whole. Except amongst certain revolutionary elements, Syndicalism has\r\nnot a strong hold on British labour.\r\n\r\n\r\nNational Guildism\r\n\r\nNext we come to the school of Guildsmen, of which that section known\r\nas the National Guilds have worked out their theory in the greatest\r\ndetail. This school says that State Socialism would mean a rigid\r\nbureaucracy, and, so far as the workers are concerned, little advance\r\non the capitalistic regime, because the workers would really be in the\r\nemployment of the State and enjoy little or no voice in the control of\r\nindustry. On the other hand, they say that the syndicalistic conception\r\nis doomed to failure because it makes no provision for including the\r\nsupervisory, technical, managerial and administrative staff in the\r\nindustrial organization that controls each industry, nor allows any\r\nsafeguards for the consuming community against the selfish exercise\r\nof monopolies upon which the people are dependent for their necessary\r\ncommodities and services. Accordingly the National Guildist proposes\r\nthat the system of craft Trade Unionism that exists in this country\r\nshould be replaced by industrial Unionism under which all manual workers\r\nemployed in each industry would be enrolled in a comprehensive Trade\r\nUnion embracing the whole of the industry, which in course of time\r\nwould be expanded into an industrial Guild that would also include\r\nall the supervisory, technical, managerial and administrative staff,\r\nand that this Guild should be entirely responsible for the control\r\nand organization of the work of the particular industry. Exactly how\r\nthe Guilds are to acquire the means of production in each industry\r\nis not yet developed; some advocate acquisition by the State for a\r\nsmall payment to the owners and then transference by the State to\r\nthe Guilds; others the forcible acquisition by the Guilds after such\r\ngradually intensive action on the part of the workers as will bring\r\nthe capitalistic system of organization of the industry to an impasse.\r\nA Guild Congress for each industry will regulate the affairs of that\r\nindustry, and a National Guild Congress of all industries the affairs\r\nof all the industries in the country. Prices and other matters in each\r\nindustry which affect the consumer will be regulated by arrangement\r\nbetween the Guild and local and central organizations representing the\r\nconsumers, and general matters in all industries affecting the community\r\nwill be adjusted by negotiations between the National Guild Congress and\r\nNational Consumers’ Organizations. Those who desire to follow out Guild\r\nSocialism both as an industrial and a political conception should read\r\nthat most interesting and brilliantly written book by Mr. G. D. H. Cole,\r\n_Guild Socialism Re-stated_; and investigate the Building Guilds.\r\n\r\n\r\nNationalization and Democratic Control\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain, political, industrial and social schemes of\r\nreconstruction have never followed strictly logical lines; they have\r\ninvariably assumed a character of compromise, thereby giving effect to\r\nnational idiosyncrasies of temperament. Accordingly we find a large\r\nbody of Socialist opinion in this country advocating what it calls\r\n“nationalization and democratic control.” Perhaps the best illustration\r\nof what is meant by that baffling phrase is afforded by the scheme of\r\nthe Miners’ Federation of Great Britain for the reorganization of the\r\ncoal industry. In that scheme, which is explained in the Bill presented\r\nto Parliament by the Miners’ Federation in 1920, the basic proposal is\r\nthat the State should buy out the coal owners and that there should be\r\nestablished a National Mining Council. Since the Miners’ Federation as at\r\npresent constituted could not appoint the technical workers, this Council\r\nwould be composed, as to one-half, of representatives of the manual\r\nworkers in the coal industry, and as to the other half by representatives\r\nof the Government. If, however, the Miners’ Federation could appoint the\r\ntechnical workers, I rather gather that they would not have been prepared\r\nto acquiesce in such duality of control. Under their proposal, the\r\none-half of the National Mining Council representing the workers would be\r\nappointed by the Miners’ Federation and the other half would be persons\r\nappointed by the Government to represent the technical, administrative\r\nand commercial sides of the industry together with other persons to\r\nrepresent the consuming community. This Council would determine the\r\nannual output, fix prices and control finances. In addition, there would\r\nbe District Councils for each coal-mining district, one-half elected\r\nby men working in the district, and the other half being technical and\r\nadministrative persons and representatives of the National Council.\r\nFurther, there would be Pit or Colliery Committees at every colliery\r\ncomprised exclusively of the managerial, technical and manual workers.\r\nThe manager as the person responsible for the governance of the mine,\r\nwould be responsible to the Pit Committee, and the Pit Committee and the\r\nmanager would be responsible for conducting the colliery.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this scheme of organization, which is probably\r\nwhat the most thoughtful sections of Labour have at the back of their\r\nminds as the kind to be applied to a well-organized industry, differs\r\nfrom State Socialism in that the State is not the direct employer, and\r\ndiffers from Syndicalism in that the workers have not autocratic control,\r\nand differs from Guild Socialism in that the conduct of the industry is\r\nnot entirely by a Guild representative of all persons concerned in the\r\nindustry, but by a Council consisting as to one-half of representatives\r\nof the miners and as to the other half of Government representatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE LABOUR PARTY’S ADOPTION OF SOCIALISM\r\n\r\n2. HISTORY OF THE ALLIANCE\r\n\r\n    Labour’s Struggle for Political Power, 1825-1832—Labour’s\r\n    Alliance with Revolutionary Socialism, 1832-1842—Labour’s\r\n    Renunciation of Socialism, 1842-1885—The Era of Constitutional\r\n    State Socialism, 1885-1905—The New Syndicalist Revolutionary\r\n    Ferment of 1905—The Socialist Societies—The Social Democratic\r\n    Federation—The Communist Party—The Fabian Society—The\r\n    Independent Labour Party—The Socialist Labour Party—The\r\n    Socialist Party of Great Britain—The National Guilds League.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to understand the present connection between the Labour\r\nParty and Socialism without some small acquaintance with the history of\r\nLabour’s attitude to Socialism in the past. That involves a retrospect of\r\nTrade Unionism. Up to 1825, anything in the nature of a Trade Union was\r\nrigorously suppressed by the Combination Laws, which, after considerable\r\nagitation, were repealed by the Acts 5 Geo. IV, 95 and 6 Geo. IV, 129.\r\nAlthough full freedom was not thereby secured for Trade Unions, yet\r\nfor the first time the right of collective bargaining was recognized—a\r\nprocess of negotiation in course of which organizations of workmen could\r\nwithhold their labour in order to secure the rates of wages or conditions\r\nof employment that they desired. As was naturally to be expected, this\r\nled to an increase in the number of Trade Unions and of their power. But\r\nfortune proved unkind. At the outset of their development there occurred\r\nthe financial crash of 1825, which caused wholesale commercial ruin and\r\nwidespread closing of works, reductions of wages and unemployment for the\r\nfour or five years following, with continual strikes by way of resistance\r\nto wage reductions. The poverty and destitution of the working-classes as\r\ncompared with the wealthier section of the community led to dissemination\r\namong the workers of revolutionary ideas, political and socialistic.\r\nOne can read in the newspapers of the time, even as far back as 1829,\r\nfamiliar doctrines—that Labour is the only source of wealth—that the\r\nworking-men are the support of the middle and upper classes, the nerves\r\nand soul of production, the foundation of the nation. From 1829, and\r\nparticularly through the Chartist days of 1835-1842, the Trade Union\r\nmovement which had previously concerned itself mainly in endeavouring\r\nto increase wages and improve conditions of employment, was actively\r\nassociated with the middle classes in prosecuting revolutionary aims.\r\n\r\n\r\nLabour’s Struggle for Political Power, 1825-1832\r\n\r\nFrom 1829-32, the struggle swayed around the Reform Bill. Both Labour and\r\nthe middle classes combined to regard the enactment of that measure as\r\nthe opening of the door to social progress. Its failure to provide for\r\nuniversal manhood suffrage shattered the hopes of Labour. Revolution had\r\nfor some time been whispered; a school of advanced Labour thought, when\r\nworking out to its logical conclusion the theory that labour was the sole\r\nsource of value, had evolved the doctrine of class-war.\r\n\r\n\r\nLabour’s Alliance with Revolutionary Socialism, 1832-1842\r\n\r\nStung by disappointment through exclusion from the suffrage, organized\r\nLabour embraced these revolutionary doctrines, arrayed itself definitely\r\nagainst Parliamentary government, and insisted that the workers’ only\r\nhope of salvation lay in direct application against the community of\r\ntheir economic power. Robert Owen about that time was the leader of\r\nsocialistic thought in this country, and Labour adopted and adapted\r\ncertain parts of his policy as its official programme. Owen’s notion\r\nsubstantially was that the machinery of production should be owned not by\r\nthe community, but by the particular section of workers who used it, and\r\nthat the Trade Unions concerned in each industry should be transformed\r\ninto national companies to carry on the trade. Profit-making and\r\ncompetition were to be eliminated. The labour of the miner, for example,\r\nwould exchange on some time-basis with the labour of the agricultural\r\nlabourer. One enthusiastic Owenite, William Benbow, elaborated the\r\ntheory of the general strike as the means of enforcing the transfer\r\nof industries from the capitalists to the workers. This was the first\r\nofficial adoption by organized Labour in this country of socialistic\r\nconceptions. The movement, however, collapsed in 1834, and was succeeded\r\nby what is now known as Chartism. That term was at the time merely\r\nunderstood to mean democratic parliamentary reform, its immediate object\r\nbeing the conquest of political power, and its ulterior purposes, so far\r\nas organized Labour were concerned, were the establishment of communist\r\ncolonies, the common ownership of land and of the means of production,\r\nsocial reform, democratic political organization, greater freedom for\r\nTrade Unions and improvement in wages and working conditions. There was\r\nthus a combination of mixed forces working indiscriminately for social\r\nreform, Trade Unionism and democratic parliamentary government. The\r\ndominant notion was to obtain parliamentary power which was thought a\r\nsufficient means to reform society, reorganize industry and purge the\r\nnation of every kind of social and industrial disorder. As is well known,\r\nthere were two distinct parties in the Chartist movement, those who\r\nadvocated physical force and those who confined their argument to moral\r\nsuasion.\r\n\r\nThe year 1842 marks the culmination of Chartism and will be remembered\r\nas the year of the general strike in the North of England, and of the\r\napparent imminence of a social revolt; but the collapse of the general\r\nstrike and the repressive action of the government took, for the time\r\nbeing, all driving force out of the agitation. When times improved, and\r\ntrade started to prosper, Chartism lost ground; the Trade Unions began to\r\ndetach themselves from schemes of social revolution, and to make their\r\nimmediate objective the improvement of the conditions of the workers\r\nin regard to wages and employment. Chartism continued as a political\r\nmovement, with varying fortunes, up to the year 1849. What it achieved\r\nup to 1855 is thus summarized by Mr. Beer in Vol. II of his _History of\r\nBritish Socialism_, p. 190:\r\n\r\n    “After a desperate contest of thirty years’ duration, Chartism\r\n    had come to an end. It had not been a struggle of a plebs for\r\n    equal rights with the patriciate to spoliate and enslave other\r\n    classes and nations, but a class-war aiming at the overthrow of\r\n    the capitalist society and putting production, distribution,\r\n    and exchange on a co-operative basis. The working-class was\r\n    apparently defeated.\r\n\r\n    “Baffled and exhausted through erratic leadership, untold\r\n    sacrifices, and want of proper mental munitions, they retired\r\n    from the field of battle, bleeding and decimated, but little\r\n    aware of the great results they had achieved. They only saw\r\n    the shattered ideals and broken hopes that lay strewn on the\r\n    long path they had been marching and counter-marching from 1825\r\n    to 1855, not knowing that it was from the wreckage and debris\r\n    of those shattered ideals that the material was gathered for\r\n    building and paving the road of social progress.\r\n\r\n    “The advance which Great Britain had made in those thirty\r\n    years in social reform and democracy was enormous. The\r\n    Chartist period witnessed the first real Factory Act (1833),\r\n    the first mining law for the protection of child and female\r\n    labour (1842), the Ten Hours’ Day (1847), the reduction of the\r\n    newspaper stamp (1836), the Abolition of the Corn Laws (1846),\r\n    the repeal of the Corresponding Acts (1846). It bequeathed to\r\n    the working-classes the co-operative store and co-operative\r\n    production, more successful trade unions, and international\r\n    sentiments. It forced the thinking men of the nation to regard\r\n    the Labour problem as a serious subject for investigation and\r\n    discussion. Finally, it imbued the thinking portion of the\r\n    working-class with the conviction that Liberalism must first do\r\n    its work, before Labour could come into its own, both in the\r\n    legislature and in the factory. In short, from the catastrophes\r\n    of 1832, 1834, 1839, 1842 and 1848, the lesson emerged that\r\n    the revolutionary policy of ‘all or nothing,’ of a sweeping\r\n    triumph by one gigantic effort, of contempt for reform and of\r\n    the supreme value of a total and radical subversion of the\r\n    old order, were foredoomed to failure. The generation that\r\n    succeeded Chartism went into Gladstone’s camp and refused to\r\n    leave it either for the social Toryism of Benjamin Disraeli or\r\n    for the social revolution of Karl Marx.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLabour’s Renunciation of Socialism, 1842-1885\r\n\r\nOnwards from the year 1842, although individual Trade Unionists\r\nand certain societies, which included no doubt members of the\r\nworking-classes, continued to promote Socialism, the British Trade Unions\r\nadvocated no scheme of Socialism as part of their official objects. They\r\ncontented themselves with improving their organizations, increasing\r\ntheir members, making provision for friendly society benefits and of\r\nintroducing methods of collective bargaining instead of class-war and\r\nof strikes. Mr. Beer again states the position at p. 195 of Vol. II,\r\n_History of British Socialism_:\r\n\r\n    “The twenty years following upon the collapse of Chartism\r\n    formed the golden age of middle-class Liberalism. The glamour\r\n    of its doctrines as set forth by Mill in his essay ‘On\r\n    Liberty,’ the phenomenal growth of British trade and commerce,\r\n    the unrivalled position of Great Britain as the workshop of\r\n    the world, made British Liberalism the lodestar of all nations\r\n    striving for freedom and wealth. Competition as the regulator\r\n    of economic relations, free trade as the international bond\r\n    of peace and goodwill, individual liberty as the sacred ideal\r\n    of national politics, reigned supreme, and under their weight\r\n    the entire formation of social revolutionary ideas of the past\r\n    disappeared from view. The working-classes formed a part of\r\n    triumphant Liberalism.\r\n\r\n    “Gladstone, surveying his hosts in 1866, appeared quite\r\n    justified in telling his Conservative opponents that there was\r\n    no use fighting against his social forces, ‘which move onwards\r\n    in their might and majesty and which ... are marshalled on\r\n    our side.’ He might have addressed the same eloquent words to\r\n    the leaders of the International Working Men’s Association,\r\n    who with Karl Marx at their head, were precisely at that time\r\n    making a serious attempt to resuscitate Chartism and detach the\r\n    masses from the Liberal Party. Socialism and independent Labour\r\n    politics came to be regarded as exotic plants which could never\r\n    flourish on British soil.\r\n\r\n    “The trade unions renounced all class-warfare and merely\r\n    tried to use their new citizenship (1867) and their growing\r\n    economic organization—the first trade union congress took\r\n    place in 1869—with a view to influencing the distribution of\r\n    the national wealth in their favour. Their aim and end was\r\n    that of a plebs striving for equality with the possessing\r\n    and ruling-classes. It was, despite some struggle for the\r\n    legalization of trade unionism, a period of social peace, and\r\n    it lasted till about 1880.”\r\n\r\nThis state of things continued in fact up to about 1885, and until that\r\ndate Socialism formed really no part of official Trade Union principles.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Era of Constitutional State Socialism, 1885-1905\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Sidney Webb in their _History of Trade Unionism_, revised\r\nedition, 1920, p. 374, describe the principles of the Labour Party about\r\n1885 as follows:\r\n\r\n    “_Laissez faire_ then was the political and social creed of the\r\n    Trade Union leaders of this time; up to 1885 they undoubtedly\r\n    represented the views current among the rank and file; at that\r\n    date all observers were agreed that the Trade Unions of Great\r\n    Britain would furnish an impenetrable barrier against Socialist\r\n    projects. Within a decade we find the whole trade union world\r\n    permeated with collectivist ideas, and, as _The Times_ recorded\r\n    as early as 1893, the Socialist Party supreme in the Trades\r\n    Union Congress. This revolution in opinion is the chief event\r\n    of Trade Union history at the close of the nineteenth century.”\r\n\r\nThese two talented authors analyse the causes. They attribute it in\r\ngreat measure to the “new unionism” of 1889 which was itself largely\r\nthe result of the wide circulation in Great Britain of Henry George’s\r\n_Progress and Poverty_ during the years 1880-1882; the lecturing of the\r\nlate Mr. H. M. Hyndman and Mr. William Morris and other disciples of Karl\r\nMarx; revelations of certain “well-intentioned if somewhat sentimental\r\nphilanthropists” of their experiences in the sweated industries and slums\r\nof our great cities, as, for example, Mr. Charles Booth’s great work,\r\n_Life and Labour in London_; depression in trade; the great Dock Strike\r\nin 1889.\r\n\r\nThe attitude observed by the Trades Union Congress in regard to\r\nsocialistic proposals is instructive. Up to 1887, at five successive\r\nconferences, amendments in favour of the nationalization of land had been\r\ncontinuously rejected; at the Swansea Conference in 1887, a resolution\r\nin no very definite terms was accepted in its favour. The extreme\r\nsocialistic conception of the advanced Trade Unionist of the nineties\r\nwas State Socialism to be secured by constitutional political action.\r\nThe power of action was to be derived from every working-class Socialist\r\nbecoming a member of his Trade Union, of his local Co-operative Society,\r\nof his borough council, urban or rural district or county council. This\r\nrepresented substantially the full socialistic creed of official Labour\r\nup to about the year 1905. Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Webb thus epitomize it:\r\n\r\n    “In short, there was from the collapse of Owenism and\r\n    Chartism in the eighteen-thirties and -forties right down\r\n    to 1900 practically no sign that the British Trade Unions\r\n    ever thought of themselves otherwise than as organizations\r\n    to secure an ever-improving standard of life by means of an\r\n    ever-increasing control of the conditions under which they\r\n    worked. They neither desired nor sought any participation in\r\n    the management of the technical processes of industry (except\r\n    in so far as these might affect the conditions of their\r\n    employment or the selection of persons to be employed), whilst\r\n    it never occurred to a Trade Union to claim any power over, or\r\n    responsibility for, buying the raw materials or marketing the\r\n    product.”—(_History of Trade Unionism_ (1920), p. 653.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New Syndicalist Revolutionary Ferment of 1905\r\n\r\nBetween 1905 and 1910 new socialistic beliefs of a Syndicalist character\r\nbegan to be absorbed by sections of Trade Unionists, especially the\r\nminers and the engineers, who soon exhibited a spirit of revolt not\r\nonly against the capitalistic system, but more especially against the\r\nlimited aims of contemporary Trade Unionism. There commenced, and up to\r\nthe beginning of the war, continued a definite struggle in the Labour\r\nmovement between the constitutional Trade Unionists who held tight\r\nto their ideals of State Socialism, and the revolutionary industrial\r\nUnionists, led by James Connolly, and Tom Mann, who preached their\r\ndoctrine of Syndicalism, advocating first the abolition of craft\r\nUnionism—the system under which all workmen of a particular craft, for\r\nexample, engineers, are enrolled in their own craft Unions irrespective\r\nof the industries in which they work—and its replacement by industrial\r\nUnionism, that is to say, the enrolment in one Trade Union representing\r\neach industry of all men engaged in that industry irrespective of their\r\nparticular craft or occupations, such as to a limited extent prevails in\r\nthe railway, mining and transport industries; secondly, the appropriation\r\nof the means of production in each industry by the manual workers who\r\nwould produce the output, charge the price and conduct the industry.\r\nConnolly, who was afterwards executed for complicity in the Irish\r\nRebellion of 1916, came from the United States of America in 1905, and\r\npersuaded the Socialist Labour Party of Glasgow to link up forces with\r\nthe American Industrial Workers of the World. Mann, who was recently the\r\nSecretary of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, brought the seeds of\r\nrevolutionary Syndicalism from Paris and sowed them personally by means\r\nof a widespread campaign.\r\n\r\nWithout any doubt, the Socialist Labour Party, an organization not,\r\nhowever, affiliated to the Labour Party, has contributed more than any\r\nother agency to the spread of Syndicalism in England. It describes\r\nitself as “a revolutionary political organization seeking to build up a\r\ncommunist movement in this country.” It works “to sweep away the mass of\r\ndebris which was once known as the parliament institutions,” Those who\r\nwant to appreciate its activities in these directions ought to follow\r\nthem in Dr. Miliukov’s _Bolshevism—An International Danger_, and I can\r\npersonally vouch for and add to his testimony. The Socialist Labour Party\r\nwas indubitably the power behind the revolutionary propaganda before the\r\nwar among the miners and the railwaymen, and to some extent among the\r\ndockers, and it was responsible for many of the numerous “irritation\r\nstrikes” in 1911-14 and for the Clyde strikes in 1916. Its disloyal\r\naction during the war, through the medium of the workers’ committees\r\nand shop steward organizations, is later described. The S.L.P. and the\r\nI.W.W. were the original founders of the “Hands Off Russia Committee.”\r\nSuch has been the revolutionary ferment leavening English and Scottish\r\nLabour since 1905—to it we largely owe our present recurrent outbursts of\r\nindustrial insurrectionism.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Societies\r\n\r\nThere are, as previously explained, certain Socialist Societies\r\ndefinitely affiliated to the Labour Party; others are unofficially\r\nrecognized, and there are yet others not recognized, either officially\r\nor unofficially, which comprise numerous persons who through their Trade\r\nUnion or local organizations, or individually, are members of the Labour\r\nParty. These advocate brands of Socialism ranging from State Socialism to\r\nrevolutionary Syndicalism.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Social Democratic Federation\r\n\r\nThe Democratic Federation, founded in 1881 by the late Mr. H. M. Hyndman,\r\nmainly as a federation of Radical clubs, with a veiled socialistic\r\nprogramme embracing land nationalization, was the first attempt at a\r\npolitical Socialist organization. In 1889 it became the Social Democratic\r\nFederation, avowedly socialistic. Late in 1884 it split into the\r\nSocialist League, under Mr. William Morris, pledged to a revolutionary,\r\nanti-parliamentary programme; and the Social Democratic Federation, led\r\nby Mr. Hyndman. But, captured by anarchists, the Socialist League broke\r\nup, many of its leaders rejoining the Social Democratic Federation.\r\nThe Federation was affiliated to the Labour Representation Committee\r\non the formation of the latter in 1900, but soon withdrew, and in 1908\r\ncalled itself the Social Democratic Party. It amalgamated in 1911 with\r\na number of local Socialist bodies and changed its name to the British\r\nSocialist Party. In 1916 it was affiliated with the Labour Party. Later,\r\nin 1916, it declared against the war and pursued a disloyal policy. This\r\nattitude, mainly exhibited through its weekly newspaper, the _Call_,\r\nled to considerable secessions from the British Socialist Party, and to\r\nthe foundation by the late Mr. H. M. Hyndman of the National Socialist\r\nParty with its weekly newspaper, _Justice_, which, while advocating the\r\nestablishment of a Socialist Commonwealth on a democratic basis, actively\r\nsupported the war. On July 31, 1920, the British Socialist Party merged\r\nits identity in the Communist Party, pledged to establish Sovietism and\r\nthe dictatorship of the proletariate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Communist Party\r\n\r\nOn January 29 and 30, 1921, there assembled at Leeds a Communist\r\nConference for the purposes of merging the various Communist bodies into\r\none party. One hundred and seventy delegates took part representing the\r\nfollowing bodies:—Communist Party of Great Britain; Communist Labour\r\nParty; Communist Party (British Section of Third International); Aberdeen\r\nCommunist Group; Left Wing of Independent Labour Party; Industrial\r\nCommunist Party; Jewish Socialist Party; Bolton Communist Group; Croydon\r\nCommunist Group; Shop Stewards; South Wales Workers’ Committee.\r\n\r\nLater on, April 23 and 24, 1921, another Communist Conference took place\r\nin Manchester to settle the constitution and the rules. The party was\r\ncalled the Communist Party of Great Britain, its ultimate purpose being\r\nthe establishment of a Communistic Republic and its immediate end the\r\nabolition of the wage-system through a social revolution. As a means\r\nof furthering a social revolution the party urges the adoption by the\r\nworkers of a Soviet or Workers’ Council system as it exists in Russia,\r\nand “for a weapon against the massing of the forces of capitalism” the\r\nuse of “the dictatorship of the revolutionary masses,” This Party applied\r\nfor affiliation to the Labour Party, but that was refused at the Brighton\r\nConference in 1921 and again at Edinburgh in 1922. It is affiliated to\r\nthe “Red” or Communist International of Moscow. The best account of the\r\nrevolutionary organizations in this country is that contained in Dr.\r\nShadwell’s _Revolutionary Movement in Great Britain_, Grant Richards,\r\nLtd., 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fabian Society\r\n\r\nThe well-known Fabian Society was founded in January 1884, and has\r\nbeen affiliated to the Labour Party from its inception. It aims at\r\nreorganizing society by emancipating land and industrial capital from\r\nindividual or class ownership and vesting them in the State. It advocates\r\ntransfer to the community of the administration of such industrial\r\ncapital as can conveniently be managed socially. As a result of this\r\ntransfer without compensation, “though not without such relief to\r\nexpropriated individuals as may seem fit to the community,” rent and\r\ninterest will be added to the reward of labour, and the idle class\r\nnow living on the labour of others will necessarily disappear. The\r\nSociety specially tries to influence local authorities so as to impart\r\na socialistic tendency to their administration. The Fabian Research\r\nDepartment has conducted many valuable investigations into industrial\r\nquestions; since October 1918, it has been known as the Labour Research\r\nDepartment; affiliation with it is open to Trade Unions, Socialist\r\nSocieties, Co-operative Organizations, Trades Councils, Labour Parties\r\nand private individuals. Its object is to co-operate with the Labour,\r\nSocialist and Co-operative movements in supplying information upon all\r\nquestions relating to labour, and it does so most effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Independent Labour Party\r\n\r\nIn 1893, the Independent Labour Party was formed. It owes its origin,\r\nas has been stated, to the energy of Mr. Keir Hardie. The “I.L.P.”\r\nwas established “to secure the collective ownership of all the means\r\nof production, distribution and exchange,” and “independent labour\r\nrepresentation on all legislative, governing and administrative bodies.”\r\nIts original constitution stated:\r\n\r\n    “That the object of that Party is to establish the Socialist\r\n    State, when land and capital will be held by the community and\r\n    used for the well-being of the community and when the exchange\r\n    of commodities will be organized also by the community, so\r\n    as to secure the highest possible standard of life for the\r\n    individual. In giving effect to this object, it will work as\r\n    part of the International Socialist Movement.”\r\n\r\nThe I.L.P. and its weekly paper, the _Labour Leader_, took up\r\npersistently a pacificist attitude throughout the war, especially in\r\nregard to compulsory military service. It is represented by four members\r\nin the present House of Commons.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Labour Party\r\n\r\nIn 1903, the Socialist Labour Party was established in Glasgow—by\r\nsecessionists from the Social Democratic Federation—on the lines of\r\nthe revolutionary American Socialist Party led by Daniel de Leon. It\r\nis in close affiliation with the Industrial Workers of the World, and\r\nactively agitates to further the Syndicalist conception of industrial\r\nUnionism. All candidates for membership must subscribe to “class-war”—no\r\nTrade Union official is eligible. The Party propagates revolutionary\r\npolitical action, and also revolutionary industrial action of the\r\nextreme syndicalistic type. The Party has between thirty and forty\r\nbranches throughout the country, owns the Socialist Labour Press, and\r\npublishes a monthly paper called the _Socialist_. Although the majority\r\nof its members are Trade Unionists, the party refuses to affiliate with\r\nthe Labour Party. Throughout the recent conflict it carried out an\r\nimplacable campaign against the war, and impeded in every possible way\r\nits successful prosecution.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Party of Great Britain\r\n\r\nIn 1905, other extreme Socialists broke away from the Social Democratic\r\nFederation and formed the Socialist Party of Great Britain. Its declared\r\nobject is to wage war against all other political parties, either\r\n“Labour or Capital.” It advocates the institution of the most extreme\r\nMarxian regime, by means of such revolutionary political action as will\r\nsecure the “capture” of all the machinery of government whether national\r\nor local. It publishes monthly the _Socialist Standard_ and is not\r\naffiliated to the Labour Party, though it comprises many Trade Unionists.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe National Guilds League\r\n\r\nIn 1915, the National Guilds League was founded to advocate the cause of\r\nGuild Socialism, which has been already described. There are two schools\r\nof thought, one which hopes to secure National Guildism by evolving\r\nindustrial Unionism out of craft Unionism coupled with the Unions\r\nsecuring an ever-increasing control over industry; the other by militant\r\nor revolutionary tactics. The National Guilds League has a number of\r\nbranches throughout the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE LABOUR PARTY’S ADOPTION OF SOCIALISM\r\n\r\n3. THE HOME SOCIALISTIC PROGRAMME\r\n\r\n    Nationalization of the Means of Production, Distribution and\r\n    Exchange—The Labour Addendum to the Whitley Report, 1918—The\r\n    Industrial Programme of 1918—Land Nationalization—The Control\r\n    of Industry—Labour’s Report to the Industrial Conference,\r\n    1919—Nationalization of the Coal Industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be sufficient to review the Labour Party’s official socialistic\r\npolicy in regard to home affairs starting from 1918. Previously to that\r\ndate, a number of resolutions had from year to year been passed, formally\r\nas hardy annuals, at the Trades Union Congresses and the Labour Party’s\r\nConferences advocating nationalization of land, railways, mines and the\r\nmunicipalization of a number of services of public utility. But from and\r\nafter 1918 the matter assumes a different complexion.\r\n\r\n\r\nNationalization of the Means of Production, Distribution and Exchange\r\n\r\nIn 1918, at the Nottingham Labour Party Conference a stock resolution was\r\npassed in these terms:\r\n\r\n    “That the Labour Party press for nationalization of all the\r\n    means of production, distribution and exchange.”\r\n\r\nThe arguments of the proposer were that because of the existence\r\nof landlordism and the power of the landlords, the people had been\r\ndriven off the land into towns and overseas, with the result that this\r\ncountry had to depend on other countries for food-stuffs. There was no\r\ndiscussion, and the resolution was passed _nem. con._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Labour Addendum to the Whitley Report, 1918\r\n\r\nThe now famous “Committee on Relations between Employers and Employed,”\r\nknown as the “Whitley Committee,” which advocated the institution in\r\nindustries of Joint Industrial Councils, Joint District Councils and\r\nWorks’ Committees, presented the last of their five Reports to the Prime\r\nMinister in 1918, dated July 1, 1918 (_Parliamentary Paper_ 1918, Cd.\r\n9153). The Trade Union members[4] of the Committee who signed the report\r\nappended this note:\r\n\r\n    “By attaching our signatures to the General Reports we desire\r\n    to render hearty support to the recommendations that Industrial\r\n    Councils or Trade Boards, according to whichever are the more\r\n    suitable in the circumstances, should be established for\r\n    the several industries or businesses and that these bodies,\r\n    representative of employers and employed, should concern\r\n    themselves with the establishment of minimum conditions and the\r\n    furtherance of the common interests of their trades.\r\n\r\n    “But while recognizing that the more amicable relations\r\n    thus established between Capital and Labour will afford an\r\n    atmosphere generally favourable to industrial peace and\r\n    progress, we desire to express our view that a complete\r\n    identity of interests between Capital and Labour cannot be thus\r\n    effected, and that such machinery cannot be expected to furnish\r\n    a settlement for the more serious conflicts of interests\r\n    involved in the working of an economic system primarily\r\n    governed and directed by motives of private profit.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Programme of 1918\r\n\r\nThe new constitution of the Party which was adopted in 1918 was described\r\nas a scheme to secure for the producers by hand or by brain the full\r\nfruits of their industry and the most equitable distribution of them upon\r\nthe basis of common ownership of the means of production coupled with the\r\napplication to each industry or service of the best system of popular\r\nadministration and control, and to promote the economic emancipation\r\nof the people, especially those who depend upon their own exertions by\r\nhand or by brain for the means of life. In explanation of this rather\r\nvague programme, the Party stated in a contemporary leaflet, that they\r\nintended that the supplies of food and other necessaries of life,\r\nespecially bread, meat, milk, sugar, butter and margarine, water, coal,\r\nlight, and transport by rail, steamer, tram and bus, now almost entirely\r\ncontrolled by monopolists, combines, trusts and rings, should be acquired\r\nby the State to be administered nationally or municipally solely in the\r\ninterest of the public and the consumers. In the Party’s proposals for\r\nreconstruction as contained in _Labour and the New Social Order_, which\r\nwas finally settled by the Labour Party Conference in June 1918, Labour\r\ndeclared that it stood for:\r\n\r\n    “The progressive elimination from the control of industry of\r\n    the private capitalist, individual or joint-stock, and the\r\n    setting free of all who work, whether by hand or by brain, for\r\n    the service of the community and the community only,”\r\n\r\nand registered its refusal\r\n\r\n    “absolutely to believe that the British people will\r\n    permanently tolerate any reconstruction or perpetuation of\r\n    the disorganization, waste and inefficiency involved in the\r\n    abandonment of British industry to a jostling crowd of separate\r\n    private employers with their minds bent, not on the service of\r\n    the community, but—by the very law of their being—only on the\r\n    utmost possible profiteering.\r\n\r\n    “What the Labour Party looks to is a genuinely scientific\r\n    reorganization of the nation’s industry, no longer deflected by\r\n    individual profiteering, on the basis of the common ownership\r\n    of the means of production; the equitable sharing of the\r\n    proceeds among all who participate in any capacity, and only\r\n    among these, and the adoption, in particular services and\r\n    occupations, of those systems and methods of administration and\r\n    control that may be found in practice, best to promote, not\r\n    profiteering, but the public interest.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLand Nationalization\r\n\r\nAt the Southport Conference, 1919, a resolution in favour of land\r\nnationalization was formally moved by the Miners’ Federation and carried\r\nunanimously by the Conference without argument or explanation; it reads\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n    “Seeing that the land alone of all the factors of production is\r\n    both indispensable to man and incapable of expansion by human\r\n    agency, it is pre-eminently the rightful property of the nation\r\n    as a whole. The present system which treats land as private\r\n    property and prevents free access to it, hampers industry,\r\n    checks production, crowds the towns by depopulating the\r\n    countryside, obstructs the provision of good housing, lowers\r\n    the standard of public health both physical and moral; this\r\n    Conference strongly urges the Government to bring forward, as\r\n    early as possible, some scheme for the nationalization of land\r\n    so as to abolish the present unjust system of land ownership\r\n    and land leasing. It strongly deprecates the action of the\r\n    Government in preventing the completion of the valuation of\r\n    the land, and demands that such valuation shall be completed\r\n    as early as possible, with a view to the ultimate complete\r\n    socialization of all land and minerals.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Control of Industry\r\n\r\nIn view of divergent proposals and the general lack of any precise\r\ninformation as to the Party’s intentions in regard to the control of\r\nindustry, it is not surprising to find this resolution passed at the\r\nSouthport Conference, 1919, and, significantly, moved by the British\r\nSocialist Party:\r\n\r\n    “That it be referred to the Executive Committee to consider\r\n    and report to a further Conference on the arrangements to\r\n    be introduced into industry in order to provide Labour with\r\n    facilities to control industry—that is to say, to participate\r\n    in the promotion of undertakings, the negotiation of\r\n    contracts, determination of the product, and the selection\r\n    of markets—and the extent that such control by Labour can\r\n    be secured, or is desirable, on the basis of the private\r\n    ownership of land and capital. The Executive shall indicate the\r\n    distinction between conciliatory Labour and Capital and the\r\n    actual control of industry by the workers, and to that end is\r\n    instructed to report on:\r\n\r\n    “(_a_) The Industrial Councils and their bearing on the\r\n    question.\r\n\r\n    “(_b_) The co-partnership of Labour and Capital.\r\n\r\n    “(_c_) The means to achieve the democratic management of\r\n    industries in national ownership.\r\n\r\n    “(_d_) How far the representation of Trade Unions, through\r\n    their Executives or by ballot of the members, could ensure\r\n    participation in actual control, and whether, for effective\r\n    control, it is not necessary that the employees in the workshop\r\n    or the pit shall construct an organization, integral to any\r\n    scheme of democratic management.\r\n\r\n    “(_e_) Whether the sole or partial management by Labour of\r\n    industries in national ownership should be confined to the\r\n    actual workers therein, or should include workers in other\r\n    occupations.”\r\n\r\nThe delegate who moved the resolution pointed out that there were\r\ndifferent opinions in the Labour Party as to control; one section\r\nadvocating nationalization pure and simple, another a system of control\r\nnot necessarily involving nationalization, and that for the guidance of\r\nthe whole Labour movement an inquiry, as suggested by the resolution,\r\nwas essential so that “instead of having so many pious resolutions they\r\nwould have facts and data upon which to build their future policy and\r\nactivity,” The guidance sought has not yet been given.\r\n\r\nAt the same conference another resolution was adopted as follows:\r\n\r\n    “That this Conference re-affirms its pledge of nationalization\r\n    of industry, but, when nationalized, to come under joint\r\n    control with adequate representation of the workers on the\r\n    boards.”\r\n\r\nThe mover of it thought the previous resolution might include\r\nco-partnership, and to that he objected. In co-partnership, he said, “the\r\nworkers interested became as great aristocrats as the ordinary employer.\r\nEvery industry ought to be nationalized and have adequate representation\r\nunder joint control.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLabour’s Report to the Industrial Conference, 1919\r\n\r\nIn a memorandum by the Right Hon. A. Henderson, Chairman of the Trades\r\nUnion representatives, which was appended to the Report of the Industrial\r\nConference in 1919 (_Parliamentary Paper_ 1919, Cmd. 501) appointed to\r\ninquire into industrial unrest, there occur these statements of Labour\r\npolicy:\r\n\r\n    “CONTROL OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n    (p. ii.) “With increasing vehemence Labour is challenging\r\n    the whole structure of capitalist industry as it now exists.\r\n    It is no longer willing to acquiesce in a system under which\r\n    industry is conducted for the benefit of the few. It demands\r\n    a system of industrial control which shall be truly democratic\r\n    in character. This is seen on the one hand in the demand for\r\n    public ownership of vital industries and services and public\r\n    control of services not nationalized which threaten the public\r\n    with the danger of monopoly or exploitation. It is also seen\r\n    in the increasing demand of the workers in all industries for\r\n    a real share in industrial control, a demand which the Whitley\r\n    Scheme, in so far as it has been adopted, has done little or\r\n    nothing to satisfy. This demand is more articulate in some\r\n    industries than others. It is seen clearly in the national\r\n    programmes of the railwaymen and of the miners; and it is less\r\n    clearly formulated by the workers in many other industries.\r\n    The workers are no longer prepared to acquiesce in a system in\r\n    which their labour is bought and sold as a commodity in the\r\n    labour market. They are beginning to assert that they have a\r\n    human right to an equal and democratic partnership in industry;\r\n    that they must be treated in future not as ‘hands’ or part of\r\n    the factory equipment, but as human beings with a right to use\r\n    their abilities by hand and brain in the service not of the few\r\n    but of the whole community.\r\n\r\n    “The extent to which workers are challenging the whole system\r\n    of industrial organization is very much greater to-day than\r\n    ever before, and unrest proceeds not only from more immediate\r\n    and special grievances but also, to an increasing extent, from\r\n    a desire to substitute a democratic system of public ownership\r\n    and production for use with an increasing element of control by\r\n    the organized workers themselves for the existing capitalist\r\n    organization of industry.”\r\n\r\n    (p. vii.) “(_a_) A substantial beginning must be made of\r\n    instituting public ownership of the vital industries and\r\n    services in this country. Mines and the supply of coal,\r\n    railways, docks and other means of transportation, the supply\r\n    of electric power, and shipping, at least so far as ocean-going\r\n    services are concerned, should be at once nationalized.\r\n\r\n    “(_b_) Private profit should be entirely eliminated from the\r\n    manufacture of armaments, and the amount of nationalization\r\n    necessary to secure this should be introduced into the\r\n    engineering, shipbuilding and kindred industries.\r\n\r\n    “(_c_) There should be a great extension of municipal\r\n    ownership, and ownership by other local authorities and\r\n    co-operative control of those services which are concerned\r\n    primarily with the supplying of local needs.\r\n\r\n    “(_d_) Key industries and services should at once be publicly\r\n    owned.\r\n\r\n    “(_e_) This extension of public ownership over vital industries\r\n    should be accompanied by the granting to the organized workers\r\n    of the greatest practicable amount of control over the\r\n    conditions and the management of their various industries.”\r\n\r\n    “STATE CONTROL AND PRICES.\r\n\r\n    (p. viii.) “(_a_) Where an industry producing articles of\r\n    common consumption or materials necessary to industries\r\n    producing articles of common consumption cannot be at once\r\n    publicly owned, State control over such industries should be\r\n    retained.\r\n\r\n    “(_b_) State control has been shown to provide some check upon\r\n    profiteering and high prices, and this is a reason why it\r\n    should be maintained until industries pass into the stage at\r\n    which they can be conveniently nationalized,”\r\n\r\n    “CONCLUSIONS.\r\n\r\n    (p. xi.) “The fundamental causes of Labour unrest are to\r\n    be found rather in the growing determination of Labour to\r\n    challenge the whole existing structure of capitalist industry\r\n    than in any of the more special and smaller grievances which\r\n    come to the surface at any particular time.\r\n\r\n    “These root causes are twofold—the breakdown of the existing\r\n    capitalist system of industrial organization, in the sense that\r\n    the mass of the working class is now firmly convinced that\r\n    production for private profit is not an equitable basis on\r\n    which to build, and that a vast extension of public ownership\r\n    and democratic control of industry is urgently necessary. It\r\n    is no longer possible for organized Labour to be controlled\r\n    by force or compulsion of any kind. It has grown too strong\r\n    to remain within the bounds of the old industrial system and\r\n    its unsatisfied demand for the reorganization of industry on\r\n    democratic lines is not only the most important, but also a\r\n    constantly growing cause of unrest.\r\n\r\n    “The second primary cause is closely linked with the first. It\r\n    is that, desiring the creation of a new industrial system which\r\n    shall gradually but speedily replace the old, the workers can\r\n    see no indication that either the government or the employers\r\n    have realized the necessity for any fundamental change, or\r\n    that they are prepared even to make a beginning of industrial\r\n    re-organization on more democratic principles. The absence\r\n    of any constructive, policy on the side of the Government\r\n    or the employers, taken in conjunction with the fact that\r\n    Labour, through the Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party\r\n    and through the various Trade Union organizations, has put\r\n    forward a comprehensive economic and industrial programme, has\r\n    presented the workers with a sharp contrast from which they\r\n    naturally draw their own deductions.\r\n\r\n    “It is clear that unless and until the Government is prepared\r\n    to realize the need for comprehensive reconstruction on a\r\n    democratic basis, and to formulate a constructive policy\r\n    leading towards economic democracy, there can be at most no\r\n    more than a temporary diminution of industrial unrest to be\r\n    followed inevitably by further waves of constantly growing\r\n    magnitude.\r\n\r\n    “The changes involved in this reconstruction must, of\r\n    course, be gradual, but if unrest is to be prevented from\r\n    assuming dangerous forms an adequate assurance must be given\r\n    immediately to the workers that the whole problem is being\r\n    taken courageously in hand. It is not enough merely to tinker\r\n    with particular grievances or to endeavour to reconstruct the\r\n    old system by slight adjustments to meet the new demands of\r\n    Labour. It is essential to question the whole basis on which\r\n    Our industry has been conducted in the past and to endeavour\r\n    to find, in substitution for the motive of private gain, some\r\n    other motive which will serve better as the foundation of a\r\n    democratic system. This motive can be no other than the motive\r\n    of public service, which at present is seldom invoked save when\r\n    the workers threaten to stop the process of production by a\r\n    strike. The motive of public service should be the dominant\r\n    motive throughout the whole industrial system, and the problem\r\n    in industry at the present day is that of bringing home to\r\n    every person engaged in industry the feeling that he is the\r\n    servant, not of any particular class or person, but of the\r\n    community as a whole. This cannot be done so long as industry\r\n    continues to be conducted for private profit, and the widest\r\n    possible extension of public ownership and democratic control\r\n    of industry is therefore the first necessary condition of the\r\n    removal of industrial unrest.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNationalization of the Coal Industry\r\n\r\nAs illustrating the position taken up by the Labour Party in regard to\r\nthe coal industry, the following was the resolution settled by a Joint\r\nSub-Committee representative of the Executive Committee of the Miners’\r\nFederation, the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress and\r\nthe Executive Committee of the Labour Party, which was submitted to,\r\nand passed by, all their local demonstrations throughout the country in\r\n1919-20:\r\n\r\n    “This Meeting declares:—\r\n\r\n    “(1) That the coal of the country forms an obvious necessity\r\n    to national life, and that its ownership should therefore be\r\n    vested in the community.\r\n\r\n    “(2) That the mines, machinery, and other means for the\r\n    production and distribution of coal, being essential to the\r\n    industry, should also be owned by the country.\r\n\r\n    “(3) That the direction and conduct of the coal-mining\r\n    industry, being of vital importance to the workers in the\r\n    industry and the coal-consuming public, should be under the\r\n    control of National, District and Pit Committees representative\r\n    of the national Government and the various classes of workers\r\n    including those engaged in the managing, technical, commercial\r\n    and manual processes.\r\n\r\n    “(4) That the objects to be sought by National Ownership and\r\n    Joint Control on the lines indicated are:—\r\n\r\n    “(_a_) To provide the maximum output of the coal consistent\r\n    with the provision of adequate protection for the workers\r\n    engaged in this most dangerous employment.\r\n\r\n    “(_b_) The introduction of labour-saving appliances on the\r\n    widest possible scale.\r\n\r\n    “(_c_) A more economic working of coal mines consequent on\r\n    the elimination of the interests of private land and royalty\r\n    ownership.\r\n\r\n    “(_d_) The remuneration of the workers in this industry on a\r\n    scale commensurate with the dangers endured and sufficient to\r\n    provide a healthy natural life for all concerned.\r\n\r\n    “(_e_) The co-ordination of the distributive machinery of the\r\n    trade by the elimination of existing private interests and the\r\n    substitution of municipal and co-operative supplies at prices\r\n    sufficient to cover costs of production and distribution.\r\n\r\n    “This meeting therefore calls upon the Government to bring\r\n    forward legislation for the national ownership of coal mines\r\n    and minerals on the lines indicated, and in accordance with the\r\n    recommendations of the Majority Report of the Coal Industry\r\n    Commission.”\r\n\r\nOn March 11, 1920, a special Trades Union Congress was held in London\r\nto consider what action should be taken to compel the Government to\r\nnationalize the coal mines, and passed this resolution:\r\n\r\n    “In view of the repeated refusal of the Government to\r\n    nationalize the mines, in accordance with the Majority Report\r\n    of the Coal Industry Commission, and in agreement with the\r\n    terms of the resolution passed at the Glasgow Congress and\r\n    the Special Congress held in December last, the Parliamentary\r\n    Committee suggest the following forms of action as a means to\r\n    compel the Government to adopt the nationalization of mines:—\r\n\r\n    “(_a_) Trade Union action, in the form of a general strike;\r\n\r\n    “(_b_) Political action, in the form of intensive political\r\n    propaganda in preparation for a General Election;\r\n\r\n    “In the event of (_a_) being carried, the necessary steps be\r\n    taken to give effect to it in accordance with the constitution\r\n    of each Union.”\r\n\r\nThe Congress decided against Clause (_a_) and in favour of Clause (_b_)\r\nproposing political action.\r\n\r\nAt the Brighton Conference, 1921, there was moved by the Miners’\r\nFederation and passed unanimously without a debate the following\r\nresolution:\r\n\r\n    “That this Conference views with regret the failure of\r\n    the Government to introduce legislation for the purpose\r\n    of nationalizing the mining industry, and reiterates its\r\n    conviction that this industry will never be placed upon a\r\n    satisfactory basis in the interest of the community until it\r\n    is publicly owned and worked between representatives of the\r\n    State and the technical and manual workers engaged in it, and\r\n    resolves to continue to educate and organize working-class\r\n    opinions until the Government are compelled to bring about\r\n    this fundamental change in the management and ownership of the\r\n    industry.”\r\n\r\nThe Chairman at that Conference, Mr. Alex. G. Cameron, in the course of\r\nhis address made these observations:\r\n\r\n    “The fundamental truth is that the supporters of capitalism\r\n    have proved to the world that so long as industry is run on\r\n    its present lines the workers will have to submit to periods\r\n    of unemployment and periods of over-employment and that the\r\n    present capitalist system must go before there can be any\r\n    permanent solution.\r\n\r\n    “The workers, by the strength of their Trade Unions, may from\r\n    time to time obtain improved conditions of employment, but\r\n    until they obtain possession of the means of producing wealth,\r\n    namely, the land, the mines, the railways, shipping, factories\r\n    and workshops, they will remain dependent on a small section of\r\n    the community providing them with employment. In other words,\r\n    they will continue to be at the beck and call of those who own\r\n    and control the capital of the country. They will, when the\r\n    capitalists decide, be allowed to apply their labour to the\r\n    production of wealth, but they will not be permitted to control\r\n    its distribution.\r\n\r\n    “Before the workers will be permitted to control industry\r\n    effectively, or even the distribution of the products of their\r\n    industry, they will first require to own the machinery and\r\n    materials of industry. Such ownership will only be acquired\r\n    when we capture political power; and political power will come\r\n    only as a result of hard thinking and intelligent action at\r\n    the ballot-box. Political power will also enable us to control\r\n    credit, money, banking and everything which is fundamental to a\r\n    nation’s foreign policy, and is the cause of most, if not all,\r\n    wars from which the workers of the world have suffered.”\r\n\r\nThe Labour Party’s specific proposals for the nationalization of many\r\nimportant industries and “their democratic control” are explained at\r\nlength in Chapter VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE LABOUR PARTY’S ADOPTION OF SOCIALISM\r\n\r\n4. THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALISTIC PROGRAMME\r\n\r\n    The First International—The Old Second International—The\r\n    International Labour Charter of 1919—The New Second\r\n    International—The Geneva Resolutions on Socialism of 1920—The\r\n    Second International and Bolshevism—The Third or Moscow\r\n    International.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First International\r\n\r\nIt is important to note the connection before the war between the Labour\r\nPatty and International Socialism. As far back as September 28, 1864,\r\nthe First International was formed in St. Martin’s Hall at the corner\r\nof Long Acre and Endell Street, the site now occupied by Messrs. Odhams\r\nand used for the publication of _John Bull_. That organization lived\r\nunder circumstances of great vicissitude as an international centre of\r\nsocialistic thought until it received its death-blow through the collapse\r\nof the Commune In Paris in 1871. Its interesting career is described in\r\nMr. R. W. Postgate’s book, _The Workers’ International_, and in _The Two\r\nInternationals_, by Mr. Palme Dutt.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Old Second International\r\n\r\nThe Second International dates from the Paris Socialist Conference\r\nof 1889, but was not constituted in its later form of a Central\r\nInternational Socialist Bureau until 1913. In 1914, it included\r\ntwenty-seven countries with a membership of twelve millions; to it the\r\nLabour Party was affiliated. It naturally fell into a state of suspended\r\nanimation during the war. Unsuccessful attempts were made at Zimmerwald\r\n(1915), Kienthal (1916), and at Stockholm (1917), to revive the Second\r\nInternational. Later, a Conference with the same object in view was\r\nheld at Berne in February 1919, where various Socialist and Labour\r\nbodies assembled to further its revival and also to deal with a number\r\nof political and industrial questions. This Conference was promoted by\r\nMessrs. Arthur Henderson, Emile Vandervelde and Albert Thomas. It passed\r\nan important resolution on “Democracy and Dictatorship,” part of which\r\nwas in the following terms:\r\n\r\n    “The Conference hails the great political revolutions which,\r\n    in Russia, Austria-Hungary and Germany, have destroyed the old\r\n    regimes of imperialism and militarism and overthrown their\r\n    Governments.\r\n\r\n    “The Conference urges the workers and Socialists of these\r\n    countries to develop democratic and republican institutions\r\n    which will enable them to bring about the great Socialist\r\n    transformation. In these momentous times, when the problem of\r\n    the Socialist reconstruction of the world is more than ever\r\n    before a burning question, the working-classes should make up\r\n    their minds, unanimously and unmistakably, about the method of\r\n    their emancipation.\r\n\r\n    “In full agreement with all previous Congresses of the\r\n    International, the Berne Conference firmly adheres to the\r\n    principles of Democracy. A reorganized society more and more\r\n    permeated with Socialism, cannot be realized, much less\r\n    permanently established, unless it rests upon triumphs of\r\n    Democracy and is rooted in the principles of liberty.\r\n\r\n    “Those institutions which constitute Democracy—freedom of\r\n    speech and of the press, the right of assembly, universal\r\n    suffrage, a government responsible to Parliament, with\r\n    arrangements guaranteeing popular co-operation, and respect for\r\n    the wishes of the people, the right of association, etc., these\r\n    also provide the working-classes with the means of carrying on\r\n    the class-struggle.\r\n\r\n    “Owing to certain recent events, the Conference desires to make\r\n    absolutely clear the constructive character of the Socialist\r\n    programme. True socialization implies methodical development in\r\n    the different branches of economic activity under the control\r\n    of the democracy. The arbitrary taking over of a few concerns\r\n    by small groups of workers is not Socialism, it is merely\r\n    Capitalism with numerous shareholders.\r\n\r\n    “Since, in the opinion of the Conference, effective Socialist\r\n    development is only possible under democratic law, it is\r\n    essential to eliminate at once any method of socialization\r\n    which has no prospect of gaining the support of the majority of\r\n    the people.\r\n\r\n    “A dictatorship of this character would be all the more\r\n    dangerous if it were based upon the support of only one section\r\n    of the working-class. The inevitable consequence of such a\r\n    regime would be the paralysis of working-class strength through\r\n    fratricidal war. The inevitable end would be the dictatorship\r\n    of reaction....\r\n\r\n    “It calls upon Socialists throughout the world to close their\r\n    ranks, not to deliver up the peoples to international reaction,\r\n    but to do their utmost to ensure that Socialism and Democracy,\r\n    which are inseparable, shall triumph everywhere.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe International Labour Charter of 1919\r\n\r\nThe Berne Conference formulated an International Labour Charter which was\r\nafterwards submitted to the Council of Versailles for inclusion in the\r\nTreaty of Peace, and was, to a considerable extent, incorporated in Part\r\nXIII. The preamble of this Charter is important and reads thus:\r\n\r\n    “Under the wage-system the capitalist class endeavour to\r\n    increase their profits by exploiting the workers in the\r\n    greatest measure possible by methods which, if unchecked,\r\n    would undermine the physical, moral and intellectual strength\r\n    of the present and future generation of workers. They impede\r\n    the development and even endanger the very existence of\r\n    Society. The tendency of Capitalism to degrade the worker can\r\n    only be completely checked by the abolition of the capitalist\r\n    system of production. Meanwhile, the evil can be considerably\r\n    mitigated, both by the resistance of organized workers and by\r\n    the intervention of the State. By these means, the health of\r\n    the workers can be protected and their family life maintained.\r\n    They make it possible for them to obtain the education\r\n    necessary to enable them to fulfil their duties as citizens in\r\n    a modern democracy.\r\n\r\n    “The degree in which Capitalism is restricted varies to a\r\n    very great extent in the different States. Through the unfair\r\n    competition of backward countries, these differences endanger\r\n    labour and industry in the more advanced States. The adjustment\r\n    of national differences in the legal protection of labour by\r\n    a system of international labour legislation has long been\r\n    a pressing need. It has been rendered doubly urgent by the\r\n    terrible upheavals and awful destruction of the vital forces of\r\n    the people brought about by the war. At the same time, however,\r\n    the war is bringing about the possibility of satisfying this\r\n    need by the formation of a League of Nations, which now seems\r\n    certain. The Berne Conference demands that the League of\r\n    Nations, as one of its primary tasks, shall create and put into\r\n    execution an International Labour Charter.”\r\n\r\nAt Berne a Permanent Commission was appointed to revive and draw up a new\r\nconstitution for the Second International. This Permanent Commission,\r\nwhich included Messrs. Henderson, Stuart-Bunning and Ramsay MacDonald of\r\nthe British Labour Party, met at Amsterdam in April 1919, to continue\r\nthat work. There was also a “Committee of Action” appointed to deal with\r\ncertain executive matters, on which Messrs. Henderson, Stuart-Bunning\r\nand Ramsay MacDonald were also placed. It was this Committee of Action\r\nwhich went to Paris to interview the “Big Four” on various international\r\nquestions, including the insertion of the Labour Charter in the Peace\r\nTreaty, and issued a manifesto on May 11, 1919, after the Peace Terms\r\nwere handed, on May 7, to the German delegates, stating that “this peace\r\nis not our peace.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New Second International\r\n\r\nAt Lucerne, in August 1919, the Permanent Commission finished the\r\ndrafting of the new constitution of the Second International, and\r\narranged for a General International Socialist Conference to be held\r\nat Geneva in 1920, to adopt it. That Conference took place in July\r\nof that year. An invitation dated April 10, 1920, was sent out to\r\nall Socialist and Labour Parties subscribing to, _inter alia_, the\r\nfollowing principle:—“(1) The political and economic organization of\r\nthe working-class for the purpose of abolishing the capitalist form of\r\nsociety and achieving complete freedom for humanity through the conquest\r\nof political power and the socialization of the means of production and\r\nexchange, that is to say, by the transformation of capitalist society\r\ninto a collectivist or communist society.” The invitation, after\r\nmentioning a number of socialistic questions to which the attention\r\nof the Conference at Geneva would be directed, concluded in these\r\nwords:—“Convinced of the necessity of a great effort to ensure unity on\r\nthe basis of the traditional principles of the class-struggle and with\r\na view to international action ... we invite you to attend the Geneva\r\nConference.”\r\n\r\nAt the Geneva Conference the constitution of the Second International was\r\nfixed; its declared purposes are as follows:\r\n\r\n    “1. The political and economic organization of the\r\n    working-class for the purpose of abolishing the capitalist\r\n    form of society and achieving complete freedom for humanity\r\n    through the conquest of political power and the socialization\r\n    of the means of production and exchange, that is to say, by the\r\n    transformation of capitalist society into a collectivist or\r\n    communist society.\r\n\r\n    “2. The international union and action of the workers in\r\n    the struggle against jingoism and imperialism and for the\r\n    simultaneous suppression of militarism and armaments, with the\r\n    object of bringing about a real League of Nations, including\r\n    all peoples master of their own destiny, and maintaining world\r\n    peace.\r\n\r\n    “3. The representation and defence of the interests of\r\n    oppressed peoples and subject races.\r\n\r\n    “These principles find three forms of expression in the\r\n    working-class movement, each at different stages of\r\n    development, but each necessary; the political, the industrial,\r\n    and the co-operative. These must, as autonomous bodies,\r\n    continue to strengthen their national influence and their\r\n    international unity, and, at the same time, as their ultimate\r\n    aims are common, and as they are aspects of one great world\r\n    movement, they should take every opportunity for joint action\r\n    in an internationalist and revolutionary spirit for the\r\n    maintenance of the world’s peace.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Geneva Resolutions on Socialism of 1920\r\n\r\nA number of resolutions were also passed, and those which relate to\r\n“Socialization” are worthy of careful study; they were the draft of the\r\nBritish Labour Party’s representatives and were in the following terms:\r\n\r\n    “SOCIALIZATION.—By Socialization we understand the\r\n    transformation from ownership and control by capitalists to\r\n    ownership and control by the community of all the industries\r\n    and services essential for the satisfaction of the people’s\r\n    needs; the substitution, for the wasteful production and\r\n    distribution with the object of private profit, of efficient\r\n    production and economical distribution with the object of the\r\n    greatest possible utility; the transformation also, from the\r\n    economic servitude of the great mass of the actual producers\r\n    under private ownership, to a general participation in\r\n    management by the persons engaged in the work.\r\n\r\n    “The continuous and rapid growth of monopolistic control of\r\n    industry by Capitalism increases the power of private owners\r\n    to manipulate the prices of all the necessaries of life, thus\r\n    reducing consumers to despair. On the other hand, there is the\r\n    growing unwillingness of organized labour any longer to support\r\n    a system of production which keeps them in subjection and does\r\n    not even enable them to raise effectively their standard of\r\n    life. The consequent intolerableness of Capitalism renders\r\n    every day more urgent the reconstruction of industry on the\r\n    lines of Socialization.\r\n\r\n    “Socialization will proceed, step by step, from one industry\r\n    to another, according as circumstances in each country may\r\n    permit. Objectionable as private profit-making enterprise is\r\n    to Socialists, they will refrain from destroying it in any\r\n    industry until they are in a position to replace it by a more\r\n    efficient form of organization. Such a gradual process of\r\n    Socialization excludes, in general, expropriation of private\r\n    ownership without compensation; not only because it would be\r\n    inequitable to cause suffering to selected individuals, but\r\n    also because a process of confiscation would disturb capitalist\r\n    enterprise in industries in which Socialization was not\r\n    immediately practicable. The funds required for compensation\r\n    will be derived from taxation of private property, including\r\n    capital levies, income-tax and death duties, and the limitation\r\n    of inheritances for the benefit of the State.\r\n\r\n    “In a community of highly developed economic life, with an\r\n    extensive population largely aggregated in urban centres,\r\n    Socialization takes three main forms—namely, national,\r\n    municipal and co-operative.\r\n\r\n    “For instance, whatever may be provided for the administration\r\n    of agriculture, the ownership of land should be national,\r\n    provision being made for the maintenance and security of\r\n    peasant cultivators, wherever such exist. Other industries of\r\n    supreme national importance, such as the transport system, the\r\n    generation of electricity and mines, should also be national.\r\n    But the management of a large number of industries and services\r\n    will be in the hands of the municipalities and other local\r\n    authorities, and federations of these, not only the provision\r\n    of water and gas and the distribution of electricity, but also,\r\n    in some countries, the provision of food, clothing and housing.\r\n    The production and distribution of household supplies of every\r\n    kind will form, for the most part, the sphere of the consumer’s\r\n    co-operative societies.\r\n\r\n    “Industries which have not yet arrived at a state of\r\n    concentration at which they are suitable for Socialization, or\r\n    in which, for other reasons, Socialization is not immediately\r\n    practicable, will be subjected to control by the community,\r\n    with a view to effecting economies and improvements in\r\n    production and distribution, fixing prices, and ensuring\r\n    prescribed conditions of employment.\r\n\r\n    “It is important to notice that, in the large measure of\r\n    individual freedom that will be characteristic of a Socialist\r\n    community, the adoption of the principle of Socialization does\r\n    not include agricultural production by individual peasants\r\n    of the nation’s land, or by independent craftsmen working on\r\n    their own account, or by artists of any kind, or by members of\r\n    the brain-working professions—provided always that they do not\r\n    exploit the labour of other persons. On the other hand, the\r\n    principle of Socialization excludes the ownership of natural\r\n    resources or of the instruments of production in the large\r\n    scale primary industries by individuals or associations of\r\n    persons of any kind, together with the dictatorship of any\r\n    person or group over the industry in which they work.\r\n\r\n    “It is the function of the community as a whole to exercise\r\n    control over the prices of commodities, and to provide whatever\r\n    new or additional capital is required from time to time for\r\n    Socialized industries.\r\n\r\n    “ADMINISTRATION OF SOCIALIZED INDUSTRIES.—A principle of the\r\n    greatest importance in Socialization is that control must be\r\n    separated from administration. The control will be exercised\r\n    by the popularly elected national assembly. The organ of\r\n    administration in each industry or service must be entirely\r\n    separate and distinct from those of the political government.\r\n\r\n    “THE NATIONAL INDUSTRIES.—Each industry or service will require\r\n    an organization appropriate to its special circumstances. As\r\n    a general type it is suggested that a national industry or\r\n    service should be provided with\r\n\r\n    “(_a_) A national board to be composed of representatives of:\r\n\r\n    “(1) the workers concerned in the industry;\r\n\r\n    “(2) the management (including the technicians);\r\n\r\n    “(3) the consumers and the community as a whole.\r\n\r\n    “(_b_) Where considered necessary, also district councils for\r\n    appropriate regional areas, to be similarly composed;\r\n\r\n    “(_c_) Works’ committees for each factory, mine or other\r\n    establishment.\r\n\r\n    “In each national industry there will have to be separate\r\n    machinery for collective bargaining between the management\r\n    on the one hand, and each distinct vocation engaged in the\r\n    industry or service on the other.\r\n\r\n    “There should accordingly be a Joint Board for each vocation\r\n    that has separately organized itself, whether in a trade union\r\n    or a professional association. Each Joint Board should be\r\n    composed in equal numbers of representatives of the management\r\n    and representatives of the trade union or professional\r\n    association concerned.\r\n\r\n    “The Right to Strike—that is to say, to refuse collectively\r\n    to continue to serve—cannot be denied to any man or woman\r\n    consistently with freedom. When it is no longer a question\r\n    of resisting the profit-making capitalist, but merely of\r\n    obtaining from the community as a whole equitable conditions of\r\n    employment and a proper standard of life, it may be expected\r\n    that the public opinion of the community as a whole will be\r\n    accepted as decisive.\r\n\r\n    “MUNICIPAL SOCIALIZATION.—The large part of the industries and\r\n    services of each community which will be in the hands of the\r\n    local authorities will be directed by the popularly elected\r\n    councils of the several localities, with participation in\r\n    the management of their own services by representatives of\r\n    the workers by hand or by brain. In municipal administration\r\n    of industries and services there should be the same kind of\r\n    machinery of Joint Boards for collective bargaining as in the\r\n    national industries.\r\n\r\n    “THE POLITICAL SYSTEM OF SOCIALISM.—The progressive\r\n    disintegration of the capitalist system, which has been\r\n    increasingly taking place during the years of war, and not less\r\n    during the years of peace following the war, makes it ever more\r\n    urgent that Labour should assume power in society. In the term\r\n    Labour we include not merely the manual working wage-earners,\r\n    but also the intellectual workers of all kinds, the independent\r\n    handicraftsmen and peasant cultivators, and, in short, all\r\n    those who co-operate by their exertions in the production of\r\n    utilities of any kind.\r\n\r\n    “1. It is an essential condition of this assumption of power\r\n    by Labour that its ranks should be sufficiently united and\r\n    that it should understand how to make use of the power in its\r\n    hands.\r\n\r\n    “2. Whilst the Congress repudiates methods of violence and all\r\n    terrorism, it recognizes that the object cannot be achieved\r\n    without the utilization by Labour of its industrial as well\r\n    as its political power, and direct action in certain decisive\r\n    conflicts cannot be entirely abandoned. At the same time, the\r\n    Congress considers that any tendency to convert an industrial\r\n    strike automatically into political revolution cannot be too\r\n    strongly condemned.\r\n\r\n    “3. The Socialist Commonwealth can come into existence only by\r\n    the conquest by Labour of governmental power. The main work\r\n    of a Labour Government will be to adopt, as the fundamental\r\n    basis of its legislation and administration, both Democracy and\r\n    Socialization.\r\n\r\n    “Socialism will not base its political organization upon\r\n    dictatorship. It cannot seek to suppress Democracy; its\r\n    historic mission, on the contrary, is to carry Democracy to\r\n    completion. The whole efforts of Labour, its Trade Union\r\n    and Co-operative activities, equally with its action in the\r\n    political field, tend constantly towards the establishment of\r\n    Democratic institutions more and more adapted to the needs of\r\n    industrial society, becoming ever more perfect and of higher\r\n    social value.\r\n\r\n    “It is to-day the forces of Labour that, in the main, ensure\r\n    the maintenance of Democracy. Socialists will not allow\r\n    factitious minorities, taking advantage of their privileged\r\n    positions, to bring to naught popular liberty. Inspired by the\r\n    great traditions of past revolutions, Socialists will be ready,\r\n    without weakness, to resist any such attacks.\r\n\r\n    “4. The franchise for a Socialist Parliament must be universal,\r\n    applying with absolute equality to both sexes, without\r\n    exclusions on grounds of race, religion, occupation, or\r\n    political opinions. The supreme function of Parliament is to\r\n    represent all the popular aspirations and desires from the\r\n    standpoint of the community as a whole. It will deal with\r\n    defence against aggression from without or within. It will\r\n    be in charge of the property and also of the finances of the\r\n    community.\r\n\r\n    “It will make the laws, and administer the public business. The\r\n    Ministers in charge of the various departments will be chosen\r\n    from among its members; and the government of the nation will\r\n    be its Executive Committee.\r\n\r\n    “But it will be free to delegate particular powers and duties\r\n    to any of the other organs of the community hereinafter\r\n    mentioned, in order to secure the greatest possible\r\n    participation of those personally engaged in each branch of\r\n    social life. It will be for Parliament to safeguard not only\r\n    the interests of the general public of consumers for whose\r\n    representation on special boards and councils it will provide,\r\n    but also the interests of the community as a whole in future\r\n    generations.\r\n\r\n    “5. It will be for Parliament to determine the general lines\r\n    of social policy and to make the laws; it will decide to what\r\n    industries and services the principle of Socialization shall\r\n    be applied and under what conditions; it will exercise supreme\r\n    financial control, and will decide upon the allocation of new\r\n    and additional capital. In the last resort, it will exercise\r\n    the power of fixing prices.\r\n\r\n    “6. In the development and expansion of the productive life\r\n    of the community, a large part will be played by the various\r\n    organizations formed according to the productive occupations\r\n    in which every healthy person will be engaged. Thus,\r\n    provision must be made, in the manner hereinafter described,\r\n    for the participation in the administration or service of\r\n    representatives of all the different grades of workers, by hand\r\n    or by brain, engaged in that particular industry or service.\r\n    At the same time, each vocation, whether of workers by hand\r\n    or of workers by brain, desires to regulate the conditions\r\n    of its vocational life, whatever may be the industries or\r\n    services among which its membership will find itself dispersed.\r\n    Each distinct vocation may therefore group itself in a\r\n    professional association, to which functions of regulation, of\r\n    investigation, or of professional education may be entrusted by\r\n    Parliament.\r\n\r\n    “7. The organizations into which those engaged in the various\r\n    industries and services will group themselves, whether trade\r\n    unions or professional associations, may be made the basis of a\r\n    further organ of social and economic life.\r\n\r\n    “Alongside Parliament it may be desirable that there should be\r\n    a National Industrial Council, composed of representatives of\r\n    the various organizations of trades and professions into which\r\n    the persons belonging to each occupation may voluntarily group\r\n    themselves. Such a National Industrial Council would be free\r\n    to discuss and criticize, to investigate and to suggest, and\r\n    to present to Parliament any reports on which it may decide.\r\n    Parliament may, from time to time, delegate to the National\r\n    Industrial Council the drafting of measures applicable to\r\n    industry as a whole, or of the regulations to be made under the\r\n    authority of a statute.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Second International and Bolshevism\r\n\r\nThe British Labour Party was asked at the Geneva Conference to undertake\r\nthe responsibility of inviting all national Socialist and Labour bodies\r\nnot represented at Geneva to join like itself the Second International.\r\nAn appeal was sent out signed in December 1920, by Messrs. A. Henderson,\r\non behalf of the Labour Party, J. H. Thomas, and Harry Gosling, on\r\nbehalf of the Trades Union Congress, and Ramsay MacDonald, as British\r\nInternational Secretary. This letter declared the position of the\r\nSecond International and also of the British Labour Party in regard to\r\nBolshevism in the following terms:\r\n\r\n    “The great difficulty which confronts International Socialism,\r\n    however, is the division of the movement into two camps as a\r\n    result of the Russian Revolution of November 1918. Bolshevism\r\n    tried to establish, not only over Russia, but over every other\r\n    country in the world, the method of seizing political power\r\n    by armed force, holding that power by the same means and\r\n    changing the whole economic structure of society by decree\r\n    and suppression. Since its first success in Russia, it has\r\n    somewhat modified its position, and at the present moment in\r\n    this country, it is informing its adherents that those who\r\n    decry political methods are traitors to the cause of Communism,\r\n    but that political action should be used solely to prove the\r\n    abortiveness of the institutions which are to be captured.\r\n    Obviously, such a compromise with the unclean thing is bound\r\n    to defeat itself and will only make candidates who pursue such\r\n    a policy ridiculous in the eyes of electors. It is political\r\n    and revolutionary futility of the simplest kind. We do not\r\n    wish, however, to argue out the matter. The policy may be more\r\n    suitable to some countries than it is to ours, but obviously\r\n    every Socialist who has any international instinct at all will\r\n    see that an International based upon Moscow principles can\r\n    never represent more than the smallest and least influential\r\n    fraction of the Socialist movement in the various countries.\r\n    The Second International has, therefore, rejected Bolshevism as\r\n    the basis of its existence.\r\n\r\n    “Moreover, the attempts made by Moscow to control national\r\n    organizations not only in general Socialist policy, but in the\r\n    details of their own national work, must prevent every such\r\n    organization with any self-respect and any sense of national\r\n    freedom from putting itself under such a yoke.”\r\n\r\nThe following statement as to the foundation upon which a Socialist\r\nInternational should be constituted is also important:\r\n\r\n    “There must be no doubt as to the basis upon which a\r\n    Socialist International has to be built. It must secure to\r\n    each Socialist group freedom to work in accordance with its\r\n    own means towards its Socialist goal; there must be common\r\n    determination to bring Socialism about; it must be prepared\r\n    to give international support to all national strivings for\r\n    liberty and self-government in ways determined by the nations\r\n    themselves; it must in no way reject (as is now being attempted\r\n    in some quarters) but unequivocally support the democratic\r\n    method as that proper to the countries that have already\r\n    gone through their political revolutions, and that have been\r\n    put in possession of the political weapon by reason of the\r\n    insurrectionary movements of their proletariat in days gone by.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Third or Moscow International\r\n\r\nThe Second International may accordingly be now regarded as\r\nre-established, if not re-created, and the interesting speculation is\r\nthe extent to which it will secure the allegiance of Socialist parties\r\nthroughout the world as against the appeals of the Third International\r\nor Moscow “Red” International. This latter deserves a short description.\r\nIn January 1919, just before the meeting of the Berne Conference, and\r\nshortly after the Peace Conference at Paris had commenced, a wireless\r\ninvitation to the first Communist International Congress at Moscow was\r\nsent out in the name of the Russian Communist Party, which was the name\r\nadopted by the Russian Bolsheviks or Majority Social Democrats after the\r\nRevolution of 1917. The Bolsheviks desired to distinguish themselves\r\nclearly from Socialist or “social democratic” parties which, in various\r\nbelligerent countries, had supported their respective Governments. They\r\ntook the name from the Communist League for which Marx and Engels drew\r\nup the famous Communist manifesto which they were commissioned to draw\r\nup in November 1847, at the Congress of Communists in London. Lenin, in\r\nhis book, the _State and Revolution_, draws special attention to the\r\nterm “communist” as being more scientifically correct than the term\r\n“social democrat” and endeavours to prove his point by quotations from\r\nthe manifesto. Following the lead of Moscow the various revolutionary\r\nSocialist parties throughout the world have discarded their Socialist\r\nappellations and called themselves Communists. One ought, therefore, to\r\nrealize that the term “Communism” has now taken on a new and different\r\nmeaning from its earlier significance. To-day Communism means the\r\nprinciples of Marxian revolutionary Socialism and a scheme of social\r\nand industrial organization constructed on those principles which are\r\npeculiar to the Bolshevik regime in Soviet Russia. In his admirable\r\nlittle book, the _Two Internationals_, which deals with the complex\r\nsubject most clearly and with very full documentation, Mr. R. Palme\r\nDutt very properly says that “care must be taken to distinguish this\r\nsense of Communism from the sense in which it has been more generally\r\nused in this country, namely, (1) the Communist Anarchism of Kropotkin,\r\n(2) the conception of the abolition of all personal property, (3)\r\ndecentralization under a system of loosely associated local communes.\r\nCommunism corresponds rather to what is often referred to as ‘scientific\r\nsocialism,’ only with a special emphasis on its revolutionary aspect.”\r\n\r\nThe First Communist International Congress was held at Moscow in March\r\n1919. It is called the Third International or Communist International;\r\nits constitution will be found in the _Labour International Handbook_,\r\n1921, page 190. Shortly stated its purposes are the overthrow of\r\ncapitalism, the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat and\r\nof the International Soviet Republic; the complete abolition of classes\r\nand the realization of revolutionary Socialism. Twenty-one conditions of\r\nmembership, together with instructions for its members, are laid down,\r\nsome of which are peculiarly illuminating as to Communist principles.\r\nCondition 3 says that “the class-struggle in almost every country of\r\nEurope and America is reaching the threshold of civil war. Under such\r\ncircumstances the Communist can have no confidence in bourgeois laws.\r\nThey should create everywhere a parallel illegal machinery which at\r\nthe decisive moment will do its duty by the party and in every way\r\npossible assist the revolution. In every country where, in consequence\r\nof martial law or other exceptional laws, the Communists are unable to\r\ncarry on their work lawfully, a combination of legal and illegal work is\r\nabsolutely necessary.”\r\n\r\nThe Communist Party of Great Britain is affiliated to the Third\r\nInternational, but the Independent Labour Party of this country,\r\nalthough it seceded from the Second International, refused to join the\r\nThird International, and published a scathing criticism of Bolshevism or\r\nCommunism which appeared in the _Labour Leader_ of December 18, 1919. The\r\nIndependent Labour Party is affiliated to yet another International, the\r\nbody known as the Vienna International or the “Two and a Half.”\r\n\r\nI have set out these details in order to show the nature and the extent\r\nof the home and international socialistic programme which the Labour\r\nParty has pledged itself, if given the opportunity, to carry into\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE LABOUR PARTY’S ADOPTION OF SOCIALISM\r\n\r\n5. APPROVAL OF DIRECT ACTION.\r\n\r\n    The Meaning and Qualities of Direct Action—Direct Action on the\r\n    Clyde, 1916—Conversion of the Labour Party to Use of Direct\r\n    Action-Establishment of the Council of Action—Setting-up of\r\n    Local Soviets.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest menace to ordered constitutional government is the\r\nLabour Party’s acceptance of the method of direct action for enforcement\r\nof its policy upon an unconforming community. Many distinguished leaders\r\nof the Party have declared against the social dangers of wielding such a\r\nweapon, but in spite of such admonitions the Party has resorted to it,\r\nand created an elaborate machinery for its application; whereupon those\r\ndistinguished leaders turned round and supported it as forcibly as they\r\npreviously condemned it. Once any section of the nation becomes addicted\r\nto the facile use of such a species of organized tyranny—because it is\r\nnothing else—however humanitarian be the alleged aim or purpose, the\r\ndeath-knell of law and order has been sounded.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Meaning and Qualities of Direct Action\r\n\r\nIn the revised edition of their _History of Trade Unionism_ (1920) Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Sidney Webb point out (p. 664) that when they published in 1897\r\ntheir _Industrial Democracy_ the term “direct action” was unknown. In\r\npoint of fact, this name for the principle or practice of social coercion\r\nthrough economic pressure made its advent into this country from France\r\nand the United States of America in 1905. By 1912 it had passed into\r\nfull currency among advanced sections of organized Labour in Scotland\r\nand parts of England, and in practice almost invariably implies either a\r\nsectional Strike by a particular group or groups of labour, or a general\r\nstrike by all groups of labour combined. All strikes are not, however,\r\ndirect action. Wage-earners reasonably contend that as any individual\r\nworkman has the right to refuse to enter into or continue under a\r\ncontract of service, any group of workmen or all groups acting together\r\nin a strike are entitled to exercise a like freedom. Mr. and Mrs. Webb\r\nare disposed to call such a strike “an economic strike” and to use the\r\nphrase a “non-economic strike” to designate a strike undertaken “not\r\nfor an alteration in the conditions of employment of any section of the\r\ntrade union world, but with a view to enforce, either on individuals, on\r\nParliament, or on the Government, some other course of action desired by\r\nthe strikers.” It is only strikes of the latter type that they place in\r\nthe category of direct action; in other words, they make the purpose of\r\nthe strike the test. That is too limited a definition of direct action,\r\nbut it would include such a case as the refusal in 1917 of the National\r\nUnion of Sailors and Firemen to work vessels by which two members of\r\nthe Labour Party were preparing, at the instance of the Government, to\r\ntravel on their way to Petrograd; also a like refusal of the same Union\r\nin 1918 to carry Mr. Arthur Henderson and M. Camille Huysmans across the\r\nChannel _en route_ for Paris, the object of the Union being to prevent\r\nthe organization of an International Socialist Conference. Another case\r\nof the same kind was the action of the Electrical Trades Union in 1918\r\nin “calling out” their members engaged in the Albert Hall in London\r\nwith instructions to appropriate the fuses—which did not belong to\r\nthem—so as to keep the Hall in darkness and prevent it being used for\r\nany purpose, as a reprisal against the proprietors for cancelling the\r\nletting of the Hall for a Labour demonstration. Further illustrations\r\nof the “non-economic strike” were the threats of the compositors and\r\nprinters in certain London newspaper offices to cease work during the\r\nrailway strike in 1919 because of the adverse criticism of the railwaymen\r\nby the editorial staff; the threat of the miners to close down the coal\r\nmines in 1919 unless compulsory military service was abolished, and\r\nunless military and naval action by the British Government against the\r\nSoviet Government of Russia was discontinued; the scheme for a strike\r\nput forward by the miners in August and September 1920 under the guise\r\nof a claim for increased wages, but really for the political purpose of\r\nforcing the nationalization of the coal industry.\r\n\r\nThe very name “direct action” indicates that the action in question\r\nis alternative to some other action regarded as indirect, which is\r\ninvariably the orderly method of procedure, prescribed by industrial\r\nagreement, or by the rules of the Trade Union, or by the Constitution\r\nof the country. Hence, in my opinion, the fundamental quality of direct\r\naction is its anarchic character. Some groups or individuals in the\r\nLabour movement resort to anarchic action in preference to orderly\r\nprocedure, deliberately as recalcitrant minorities, who, bound by the\r\nformal agreement of majorities, intend to prevent the view of the\r\nmajority being carried into effect. Others, impatient reformers who\r\nregard orderly methods as too cumbersome and dilatory, and are either not\r\nable or not prepared to work for gradual amendment, follow their example.\r\nAnd one further sees direct action adopted with the ulterior object\r\nof wrecking existing craft Trade Union organization, as for instance\r\nby revolutionary Unionists in old skilled Unions like the Amalgamated\r\nEngineering Union, or by revolutionary Syndicalists who wish to exercise\r\nand develop all the latent power of manual workers so that the weapon of\r\nthe general strike may be sharp and bright on the day when it is to be\r\nused to hack down the Constitution, and usher in the social revolution.\r\nThese, however, are special reasons. In the minds of great and slow\r\nthinking sections of Labour, direct action has come to be regarded as the\r\neasiest and quickest, sometimes as the only, road to political power.\r\nLabour is greedy for political power; it intends to make its political\r\nfortune, in the words of Horace, “_Si possis, recte; si non, quocunque\r\nmodo...._”\r\n\r\nThe anarchic character of direct action constitutes its real danger far\r\nmore than its non-economic purpose, if the purpose be non-economic,\r\nwhich it very frequently is not. Just as any anarchic method betokens,\r\nso does it beget, a lawless as distinguished from law-abiding quality\r\nof mind. Human nature is not lawless in one sphere of its activity and\r\nconstitutionally minded in another, anarchic, for example, in industrial\r\naffairs and orderly in politics. The same strain runs right through;\r\nan undisciplined individual makes as bad a citizen as he does a Trade\r\nUnionist. It was the anarchic character of direct action that impressed\r\nitself most strongly on the writer’s mind during the anxious years\r\n1914-1918 before any non-economic strikes such as those described above\r\nhad occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\nDirect Action on the Clyde, 1916\r\n\r\nTake for instance the strikes of March to April 1916, in the engine shops\r\nof Clydeside, which the writer had to handle. The Government had made\r\nwith the Trade Unions the “Treasury” Agreements of March 1915, providing\r\nfor the suspension of Trade Union customs in order to accelerate and\r\nincrease output. The Amalgamated Society of Engineers Executive Council\r\nhad formally submitted the agreements by ballot to its members, who\r\nby a large majority had accepted them. Acting under the agreements the\r\nGovernment proceeded to introduce women into engineering shops throughout\r\nthe country with the co-operation of the A.S.E. Executive. But on\r\nClydeside members of the A.S.E. refused to allow women to enter the shops\r\non the agreed conditions, or at all.\r\n\r\nMany of the shop stewards[5] in the engineering shops on Clydeside were\r\nmembers of the Socialist Labour Party. The principles of the S.L.P.,\r\ncopied from those of the I.W.W., involve (see p. 54) class-warfare,\r\nthe destruction of the official Trade Unions and of all industrial\r\norganizations except those of a similar type and creed to the I.W.W.\r\nitself, the overthrow of all existing forms of constitutional government\r\nand their replacement by a government of manual workers. The method\r\nto be employed is direct action. Mr. Beer, in his _History of British\r\nSocialism_ (Vol. II, p. 393), says: “The S.L.P. theories came nearest to\r\nthose of Lenin and Trotsky.”\r\n\r\nOn Clydeside in March 1916, the S.L.P. shop stewards saw their\r\nrevolutionary opportunity. The writer held innumerable conferences with\r\nthem trying to introduce harmoniously the agreed scheme of dilution\r\nof labour, but as fast as he made progress with the assistance of the\r\nExecutive Council of the A.S.E. and their local Glasgow officials, it was\r\ncountered by preparations for obstructive direct action. Finally, the\r\ndirect actionists matured their plans. It is a principle of theirs always\r\nto use the sharpest weapons. There was one immediately to hand. The\r\narmy in France was in dire need of heavy howitzers to smash the system\r\nof trenches which the Germans had commenced to consolidate; Mesopotamia\r\nurgently required flat-bottomed barges. These two classes of munitions\r\nwere being manufactured in engineering shops and shipyards on the Clyde.\r\nThe direct actionists therefore brought out, or tried to bring out, on\r\nstrike, all employees in every shop and yard where the howitzers or any\r\npart of the howitzers or the flat-bottomed barges were in course of\r\nconstruction, with almost complete success, and with disastrous national\r\nresults. But the Government met direct action by action more direct,\r\nand deported from the Clyde the ringleaders, and the strike collapsed.\r\nIn this direct action strike the purpose was to nullify the agreement\r\nbetween the Government and the Trade Unions as to the introduction\r\nof women into the engineering trade, and to destroy the old craft\r\norganizations of the A.S.E. and set up a new industrial organization for\r\nthat trade. The purpose, therefore, was economic, but the method was\r\nanarchic.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, the Clyde Workers’ Committee (a committee of Clydeside\r\nshop stewards working in co-operation with the Socialist Labour\r\nParty) established revolutionary Workers’ Committees in various\r\nparts of England, and were behind similar direct action unofficial\r\nstrikes, repudiated by the Executives of all the Unions concerned, in\r\nBarrow-in-Furness in June 1916, on the Mersey in the autumn of 1916, in\r\nthe engineering shops of England in May 1917, and at other times. These\r\nwere all economic strikes against trade agreements and arrangements\r\nconstitutionally concluded between the Government and the Unions. That\r\nsuch anarchic strikes are entirely subversive of all law, order and\r\ngovernment in a Trade Union organization as well as in the body politic\r\nneeds no emphasis. They are just as dangerous to society as any strike\r\nregularly declared by a Trade Union for a non-economic purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nConversion of the Labour Party to Use of Direct Action\r\n\r\nBut to revert to the non-economic strike: Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Webb, who\r\nhave a wide knowledge of the currents and under-currents of opinions in\r\nthe industrial world, say on p. 672 of their _History of Trade Unionism_\r\n(1920):\r\n\r\n    “With regard to a general strike of non-economic or political\r\n    character, in favour of a particular home or foreign policy,\r\n    we very much doubt whether the Trades Union Congress could\r\n    be induced to endorse it, or the rank and file to carry it\r\n    out, except only in case the Government made a direct attack\r\n    upon the political or industrial liberty of the manual\r\n    working-class, which it seemed imperative to resist by every\r\n    possible means, not excluding forceful revolution itself.”\r\n\r\nThe kind of direct attack by the Government which the writers had in mind\r\nwas action such as disfranchisement of the bulk of the manual workers, or\r\ndeprivation of the Trade Unions of their present rights and liberties, or\r\nconfiscation of their funds. Short of attempted measures like these, it\r\nwas the considered opinion of those eminently competent writers, looking\r\nout over the Trade Union world as recently as the autumn of 1919, that\r\ndirect action would be rejected by the Trades Union Congress. But the\r\nPortsmouth Congress of 1920 was yet to come.\r\n\r\nThe specific issue of direct action, in connection with the operations\r\nagainst Russia, was brought before the Trades Union Congress in\r\nSeptember 1919, but was strategically shelved. Resolutions were, however,\r\npassed demanding the cessation of operations against Russia and the\r\nnationalization of coal. To enforce these demands, the Parliamentary\r\nCommittee was instructed in the former case to call a special Trades\r\nUnion Congress to decide what action should be taken; in the latter to\r\ndecide “the form of action to be taken to _compel_ the Government.”\r\nThis special Congress was held on December 9, 1919—by that time\r\nnationalization had become the real issue—but pending the effect of\r\nmore forcible propaganda, direct action to enforce nationalization was\r\ndeferred until March 1920. In March, another special Congress was held\r\nat which two means of enforcing nationalization were outlined to the\r\nCongress—one a general strike, the other intensive political propaganda.\r\nCongress decided (p. 63) on a card vote against direct action and in\r\nfavour of intensive political propaganda in preparation for a General\r\nElection.\r\n\r\nThe solidarity of the Party was seriously endangered by the decision; the\r\ndirect actionists included influential sections of miners, railwaymen,\r\ntransport workers and engineers, to many of whom direct action had become\r\nan article of belief. Many moderates and extremists, therefore, strove\r\nto find an issue on which direct actionists and constitutionalists could\r\nbe persuaded to co-operate. The production of munitions of war for use\r\nin Ireland and against Russia was chosen as the issue. It was cleverly\r\ncontrived, and at a special meeting of the Trades Union Congress in July\r\n1920, a resolution was passed in favour of a general strike to compel the\r\nGovernment to desist from armed intervention in Ireland and in Russia,\r\nand instructing the affiliated Unions to make the necessary domestic\r\narrangements for such a strike. Moderate Labour was thus impaled on the\r\nhorns of an adroit dilemma, and the more pacificist it was, the more it\r\nwas impelled to vote for direct action. The Labour Party congratulated\r\nitself that it had restored its all-essential solidarity; but the\r\nsolidarity achieved was more apparent than real—Trade Union domestic\r\narrangements for a general strike progressed with no enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThen came the Polish imbroglio which the extremists exploited to the\r\nfull in order to establish direct action as the recognized weapon\r\nof organized Labour in this country. It is important to follow this\r\ndevelopment. On August 6, 1920, the Labour Party, without the slightest\r\njustification, publicly charged the Government with meditating a war\r\nagainst Soviet Russia in support of Poland, and claimed that the workers\r\nwould be justified in refusing to render labour services in such a\r\nwar. A special emergency meeting of the Parliamentary Committee of the\r\nTrades Union Congress, the National Executive of the Labour Party, and\r\nthe Parliamentary Labour Party met on August 9. “It felt certain,” so\r\nthe resolution ran, “that war was being engineered between the Allied\r\nPowers and Soviet Russia,” and “warned the Government that the whole\r\nindustrial power of the organized workers would be used to defeat this\r\nwar.” Arrangements were made for a national conference of Labour, and all\r\naffiliated organizations were advised to instruct their members to “down\r\ntools” on instructions to that effect from the national conference.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstablishment of the Council of Action\r\n\r\nOn August 13, 1920, the national conference met, 689 representatives\r\nof Trade Union executive committees, and 355 representatives of Local\r\nLabour Party organizations and Trade councils. Three resolutions were\r\nunanimously carried. The first endorsed the creation of the Council of\r\nAction which had been formed on August 9 representing the Parliamentary\r\nLabour Party, the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress\r\nand the Executive of the Labour Party. The second continued the Council\r\nin being until it had secured: (1) a guarantee there should be no\r\nmilitary or naval intervention against the Soviet Government; (2) the\r\nwithdrawal of all British naval forces “operating directly or indirectly\r\nas a blockading influence against Russia”; (3) “the recognition of the\r\nRussian Soviet Government, and the establishment of unrestricted trading\r\nand commercial relationship between Great Britain and Russia.” It also\r\nauthorized the Council to order any and every form of withdrawal of\r\nlabour which circumstances might require to give effect to the foregoing\r\npolicy, and called for swift, loyal and courageous action by every\r\nTrade Union official, executive committee, local council of action, and\r\nmembership in general, in response to such an order. The third resolution\r\nauthorized the Council to take any steps necessary to give effect to the\r\ndecisions of the conference, and to “the declared policy of the Trade\r\nUnion and Labour movement.”\r\n\r\nThe effect of these resolutions was clear. Trade Unions handed over\r\ntheir executive responsibility to the Council of Action, or “Committee\r\nof National Security,” as one speaker called it. This Council could then\r\nimpose its will upon the nation through the direct action of seizing it\r\nby the throat. That the will may be thought beneficent does not alter in\r\nthe slightest the anarchic quality of the action. The Chairman of the\r\nParliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, in proposing the\r\nsecond resolution, put it plainly: “Giving effect to this resolution does\r\nnot mean a mere strike; it means a challenge to the whole Constitution of\r\nthe country.” The report says there were prolonged cheers. He reiterated\r\nthe same statement at the subsequent meeting of the Trades Union Congress\r\nin Portsmouth. The Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Labour\r\nParty, in seconding the first resolution, was even more explicit:\r\n\r\n    “When the action referred to was taken, if too much\r\n    interference was attempted they might be compelled to do things\r\n    that would cause the present authorities (i.e. the Government)\r\n    to abdicate. They might be forced to tell them that if they\r\n    could not run this country in a peaceful manner without\r\n    interfering with other nations, they might be compelled,\r\n    against all constitutionalism, to chance doing something to\r\n    take the country into their own hands.”\r\n\r\nThere is nothing confused in this outlook. The speaker regarded direct\r\naction as the method by which to achieve his ends. The Labour Party would\r\nbecome the Government without the ordinary preliminary of a General\r\nElection. The outsider wonders why the “International,” which was sung\r\nimmediately after the passing of the first and third resolutions, was\r\nomitted after the second.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the Labour argument for this official inauguration of\r\ndirect action turned on the assumption that the Bolshevik Government\r\nwas standing in a white sheet and contemplated no ulterior threat to\r\nPolish independence. Labour accepted Bolshevik professions to this\r\neffect with credulous alacrity. Then came the amazing _dénouement_. It\r\nturned out that, with characteristic Bolshevik duplicity, there had\r\nbeen deleted from the draft of the proposed peace terms, communicated\r\nto England, certain vitally important articles going to the root of\r\nPolish independence, which, however, were inserted in that presented by\r\nthe Bolsheviks to the Poles at Minsk on August 19. The doctored English\r\nversion, after specifying the strength to which the Polish Army was to be\r\ncut down, provided that all arms over and above those required for the\r\nneeds of the army as so reduced, “as well as of the Civic Militia,” were\r\nto be handed over to Russia. In the Minsk version, the Civic Militia was\r\nthe crux of the terms; it was to be recruited from one class only, _the\r\nworkers_; to be in strength four times that of the regular Polish army,\r\nand armed; in other words, a Red Army in Poland. This exactly enforced\r\nSection 8 of Lenin’s Third International Constitution, which stipulates\r\nfor the “disarmament of the bourgeoisie and the arming of the workers\r\nto defend Communism until Capitalism shall finally have been abolished.”\r\nThere was in truth at no time any argument from Poland to support direct\r\naction. The reason for its adoption was far more accurately stated by\r\nMr. Robert Williams, the Secretary of the National Transport Workers’\r\nFederation, a leading member of the notorious Council of Action. In\r\nthe _Daily Herald_ for August 25, 1920, he is reported to have said as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “We felt that with the policy of Mr. Lloyd George, which sways\r\n    to and fro according to events, we were menaced with war from\r\n    the moment that the Poles were in peril. Together with several\r\n    friends we drew up a manifesto which even the Conservatives\r\n    among the Labour leaders signed, because they recognized\r\n    clearly that they could no longer oppose the advanced elements\r\n    _which had for so long insisted on the employment of direct\r\n    action_.”\r\n\r\nThis recalls Lord Bacon’s aphorism on faction: “It is often seen that a\r\nfew that are stiff do tire out a greater number that are more moderate.”\r\nThe extremists had been struggling for ten years to establish the\r\nadoption of direct action under all circumstances as Labour’s normal\r\nweapon of attack. They succeeded because the chief anxiety of Labour\r\nleaders, whether advancing at the head or running at the heels of their\r\nflock, is always, at any price, to secure or conserve solidarity.\r\n\r\n\r\nSetting-up of Local Soviets\r\n\r\nOver 350 Local Councils of Action, in many districts called Soviets, were\r\norganized to carry out the instructions of the central Council of Action.\r\nSomewhat amusing was it to see how quickly the Council of Action, when\r\nit realized that public opinion was setting strongly against it, at once\r\ndisclaimed any intention of calling a general strike in support of Soviet\r\nRussia. All it intended at the utmost “was to veto the manufacture or\r\ntransport of munitions or equipment for the Poles,” The Council quickly\r\nappreciated that the nation would not tolerate the application in this\r\ncountry of revolutionary methods. One of the reasons advanced for the\r\nformation of the Council of Action was to “prevent interference by the\r\nBritish Government in the affairs of Soviet Russia,” No sooner, however,\r\nwas it formed, than two delegates[6] of the Council went to Paris, there\r\nto interfere between the French Government and French Labour. A little\r\nlogic was infused into them by the French Government, who promptly\r\nordered them out of France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE LABOUR PARTY’S INDUSTRIAL AND LAND POLICY\r\n\r\n1. DETAILS OF THE PROPOSALS\r\n\r\n    The Industries and Businesses to be Nationalized—Extension\r\n    of Municipal Enterprise—Control of Capitalistic Industries\r\n    and Businesses—Labour’s Agricultural Policy—Abolition\r\n    of Landlordism—Councils for Agriculture—A Legal Minimum\r\n    Agricultural Wage—Workers’ Control of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already given a general outline of Labour’s policy; it\r\nnow remains to set out its particular proposals in regard to the\r\nreconstruction of industry. These we take from _Labour and the New Social\r\nOrder_, published in 1918. If, as is not unlikely, readers feel aggrieved\r\nby want of definiteness, it is not the fault of the author, but of the\r\nLabour Party.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Industries and Businesses to be Nationalized\r\n\r\n“The Labour Party stands not merely for the principle of the common\r\nownership of the nation’s land, to be applied as suitable opportunities\r\noccur, but also, specifically, for the immediate nationalization of\r\nrailways, mines, and the production of electrical power. We hold that\r\nthe very foundation of any successful reorganization of British industry\r\nmust necessarily be found in the provision of the utmost facilities for\r\ntransport and communication, the production of power at the cheapest\r\npossible rate, and the most economical supply of both electrical\r\nenergy and coal to every corner of the kingdom. Hence the Labour Party\r\nstands, unhesitatingly, for the national ownership and administration\r\nof the railways and canals, and their union, along with harbours and\r\nroads, and the posts and telegraphs—not to say also the great lines\r\nof steamers which could at once be owned, if not immediately directly\r\nmanaged in detail, by the Government—in a united national service of\r\nCommunication and Transport, to be worked, unhampered by capitalist,\r\nprivate or purely local interests (and with a steadily increasing\r\nparticipation of the organized workers in the management, both central\r\nand local), exclusively for the common good. If any Government should\r\nbe so misguided as to propose, when peace comes, to hand the railways\r\nback to the shareholders; or should show itself so spendthrift of the\r\nnation’s property as to give these shareholders any enlarged franchise\r\nby presenting them with the economies of unification or the profits of\r\nincreased railway rates; or so extravagant as to bestow public funds on\r\nthe re-equipment of privately-owned lines—all of which things are now\r\nbeing privately intrigued for by the railway interests—the Labour Party\r\nwill offer any such project the most strenuous opposition. The railways\r\nand canals, like the roads, must henceforth belong to the public, and to\r\nthe public alone.”\r\n\r\n“In the production of electricity, for cheap power, light and heating,\r\nthis country has so far failed, because of hampering private interests,\r\nto take advantage of science. Even in the largest cities we still\r\n‘peddle’ our electricity on a contemptibly small scale. What is called\r\nfor, immediately after the war, is the erection of a score of gigantic\r\n‘super-power stations,’ which could generate, at incredibly cheap rates,\r\nenough electricity for the use of every industrial establishment and\r\nevery private household in Great Britain, the present municipal and\r\njoint-stock electrical plants being universally linked up and used for\r\nlocal distribution. This is inevitably the future of electricity. It\r\nis plain that so great and so powerful an enterprise affecting every\r\nindustrial enterprise, and, eventually, every household, must not be\r\nallowed to pass into the hands of private capitalists. They are already\r\npressing the Government for the concession, and neither the Liberal nor\r\nthe Conservative Party has yet made up its mind to a refusal of such a\r\nnew endowment of profiteering in what will presently be the life-blood of\r\nmodern productive industry. The Labour Party demands that the production\r\nof electricity on the necessary gigantic scale shall be made, from the\r\nstart (with suitable arrangements for municipal co-operation in local\r\ndistribution), a national enterprise, to be worked exclusively with the\r\nobject of supplying the whole kingdom with the cheapest possible power,\r\nlight and heat.”\r\n\r\n“But with railways and the generation of electricity in the hands of the\r\npublic, it would be criminal folly to leave the present 1,500 colliery\r\ncompanies the power of ‘holding up’ the coal supply. These are now all\r\nworking under public control, on terms that virtually afford to their\r\nshareholders a statutory guarantee of their swollen incomes. The Labour\r\nParty demands the immediate nationalization of mines, the extraction\r\nof coal and iron being worked as a public service (with a steadily\r\nincreasing participation in the management, both central and local, of\r\nthe various grades of persons employed), and the whole business of the\r\nretail distribution of household coal being undertaken as a local public\r\nservice, by the elected municipal or county councils. And there is no\r\nreason why coal should fluctuate in price any more than railway fares,\r\nor why the consumer should be made to pay more in winter than in summer,\r\nor in one town than another. What the Labour Party would aim at is, for\r\nhousehold coal of standard quality, a fixed and uniform price for the\r\nwhole kingdom, payable by rich and poor alike, as unalterable as the\r\npenny postage-stamp.”\r\n\r\n“But the sphere of immediate nationalization is not restricted to these\r\ngreat industries. We shall never succeed in putting the gigantic system\r\nof Health Insurance on a proper footing, or secure a clear field for\r\nthe beneficent work of the Friendly Societies, or gain a free hand for\r\nthe necessary development of the urgently called for Ministry of Health\r\nand the Local Public Health Service, until the nation expropriates the\r\nprofit-making industrial insurance companies, which now so tyrannously\r\nexploit the people with their wasteful house-to-house industrial life\r\nassurance. Only by such an expropriation of life assurance companies\r\ncan we secure the universal provision, free from the burdensome toll of\r\nweekly pence, of the indispensable funeral benefit. Nor is it in any\r\nsense a ‘class’ measure. Only by the assumption by a State Department of\r\nthe whole business of life assurance can the millions of policy-holders\r\nof all classes be completely protected against the possibly calamitous\r\nresults of the depreciation of securities and suspension of bonuses which\r\nthe war is causing. Only by this means can the great staff of insurance\r\nagents find their proper place as civil servants, with equitable\r\nconditions of employment, compensation for any disturbance and security\r\nof tenure, in a nationally organized public service for the discharge of\r\nthe steadily increasing functions of the Government in vital statistics\r\nand social insurance.”\r\n\r\n“In quite another sphere the Labour Party sees the key to temperance\r\nreform in taking the entire manufacture and retailing of alcoholic\r\ndrink out of the hands of those who find profit in promoting the utmost\r\npossible consumption. This is essentially a case in which the people, as\r\na whole, must assert its right to full and unfettered power for dealing\r\nwith the licensing question in accordance with local opinion. For this\r\npurpose, localities should have conferred upon them facilities:—\r\n\r\n    “(_a_) To prohibit the sale of liquor within their boundaries;\r\n\r\n    “(_b_) To reduce the number of licences and regulate the\r\n    conditions under which they may be held; and\r\n\r\n    “(_c_) If a locality decides that licences are to be granted,\r\n    to determine whether such licences shall be under private or\r\n    any form of public control.”\r\n\r\n\r\nExtension of Municipal Enterprise\r\n\r\n“Other main industries, especially those now becoming monopolized,\r\nshould be nationalized as opportunity offers. Moreover, the Labour Party\r\nholds that the municipalities should not confine their activities to the\r\nnecessarily costly services of education, sanitation and police; nor yet\r\nrest content with acquiring control of the local water, gas, electricity\r\nand tramways; but that every facility should be afforded to them to\r\nacquire (easily, quickly and cheaply) all the land they require, and to\r\nextend their enterprises in housing and town planning, parks and public\r\nlibraries, the provision of music and the organization of recreation;\r\nand also to undertake, besides the retailing of coal, other services of\r\ncommon utility, particularly the local supply of milk, wherever this is\r\nnot already fully and satisfactorily organized by a Co-operative Society.”\r\n\r\n\r\nControl of Capitalistic Industries and Businesses\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile, however, we ought not to throw away the valuable experience\r\nnow gained by the Government in its assumption of the importation of\r\nwheat, wool, metals and other commodities, and in its control of the\r\nshipping, woollen, leather, clothing, boot and shoe, milling, baking,\r\nbutchering, and other industries. The Labour Party holds that, whatever\r\nmay have been the shortcomings of the Government importation and control,\r\nit has demonstrably prevented a lot of ‘profiteering.’ Nor can it end\r\nimmediately on the declaration of peace. The people will be extremely\r\nfoolish if they ever allow their indispensable industries to slip back\r\ninto the unfettered control of private capitalists, who are, actually at\r\nthe instance of the Government itself, now rapidly combining trade by\r\ntrade, into monopolist Trusts, which may presently become as ruthless\r\nin their extortion as the worst American examples. Standing as it does\r\nfor the democratic control of industry, the Labour Party would think\r\ntwice before it sanctioned any abandonment of the present profitable\r\ncentralization of purchase of raw material; of the present carefully\r\norganized ‘rationing,’ by joint committees of the trades concerned,\r\nof the several establishments with the materials they require; of the\r\npresent elaborate system of ‘costing’ and public audit of manufacturers’\r\naccounts, so as to stop the waste heretofore caused by the mechanical\r\ninefficiency of the more backward firms; of the present salutary\r\npublicity of manufacturing processes and expenses thereby ensured; and,\r\non the information thus obtained (in order never again to revert to the\r\nold-time profiteering) of the present rigid fixing, for standardized\r\nproducts, of maximum prices at the factory, at the warehouse of the\r\nwholesale trader, and in the retail shop. This question of the retail\r\nprices of household commodities is emphatically the most practical of\r\nall political issues to the woman elector. The male politicians have\r\ntoo long neglected the grievances of the small household, which is the\r\nprey of every profiteering combination; and neither the Liberal nor the\r\nConservative Party promises, in this respect, any amendment. This, too,\r\nis in no sense a ‘class’ measure. It is, so the Labour Party holds, just\r\nas much the function of Government, and just as necessary a part of the\r\ndemocratic regulation of industry, to safeguard the interests of the\r\ncommunity as a whole, and those of all grades and sections of private\r\nconsumers, in the matter of prices, as it is by the Factory and Trade\r\nBoards Acts, to protect the rights of the wage-earning producers in the\r\nmatter of wages, hours of labour and sanitation.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLabour’s Agricultural Policy\r\n\r\nAn official pamphlet called the _Labour Party and the Countryside_\r\nstates Labour’s agricultural policy “as settled by representatives of\r\nthe Party’s 300,000 affiliated agricultural members.” With pride it is\r\nannounced that members engaged in industry and living in towns had no\r\nfinger in it. It is claimed to be the fruit of practical experience—the\r\nconclusion of experts. Endorsed by the National Executive of the Labour\r\nParty, it is stated to crystallize the principles upon which the Party\r\nwill deal with agricultural and rural problems. The basis is to be the\r\nnon-sectarian principle of “increased production of food stuffs by the\r\nemployment of more British labour on better cultivated British land.”\r\nThe Coalition Government is charged with repudiating this principle and\r\nwith having perpetrated in 1921 a shameless and scandalous deceit in\r\n“scrapping” the Corn Production Acts, 1917 and 1920.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbolition of Landlordism\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, land is to be nationalized. Many evils and much\r\noppression are attributed to private ownership. Landlords have obstructed\r\nevery measure of land reform; thwarted food production; obstructed\r\nhousing, small holdings and land reclamation; demanded extortionate\r\nprices for land for public needs and appropriated as unearned increment\r\na large part of the value of every tenant’s improvement. “For the Labour\r\nParty” therefore “the substitution of public for private ownership in\r\nland (subject to equitable treatment of each person whose property is\r\nrequired for the public good and to a proper security of tenure for\r\nthe home and the homestead) underlies in principle all its specific\r\nproposals.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCouncils for Agriculture\r\n\r\nCouncils for agriculture are to be constituted for each county, one-third\r\nthereof elected by farmers, another one-third by farm labourers and\r\nthe remaining one-third nominated “by the various public authorities\r\nin the county, including the county council, to represent the public\r\ninterest.” Some good work is credited to the existing county agricultural\r\ncommittees, but they are condemned as hampered by their constitution.\r\nMembers of the councils would receive travelling expenses and payment for\r\ntime spent on public service. The primary duty of each council would be\r\nto supervise farming in the county and secure and maintain an all round\r\nimprovement in cultivation, an increase in the area under plough and an\r\naggregate increase in the production of food stuffs. In the event of bad\r\nfarming, councils would have power to take over the land and cultivate it\r\nin the public interest. A Central National Council of Agriculture would\r\nadvise the Minister of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Legal Minimum Agricultural Wage\r\n\r\nA legal minimum wage (whether on a national or district basis is not\r\nstated, but presumably the latter) and standard conditions of employment\r\nare to be established for every farm, market garden and fruit orchard\r\nworker and gardener in domestic employment, to all of whom the National\r\nUnemployment Insurance Scheme would be extended. This in the first\r\ninstance is to be effected by re-establishing the National Wages\r\nBoard and County Wages Committees of the Ministry of Agriculture, the\r\nabolition of which in 1921 is characterized as a “flagrant breach of\r\nfaith.” The fund out of which increased wages are to be paid is to be\r\ncreated out of the profits of better farming, increased production,\r\norganized marketing, less costly transport, lower retail prices of\r\nfarmers’ supplies and the elimination of profits now taken by unnecessary\r\nmiddlemen. A national scheme of insurance managed on a co-operative basis\r\nby agriculturalists themselves is to be established against the risk of\r\nunfavourable weather and sudden falls in world prices.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkers’ Control of Agriculture\r\n\r\n“Democratic control” is to be introduced into the agricultural industry\r\nas in other industries, “to supersede the economic dependence of the\r\nagricultural worker on the farmer for employment and livelihood with the\r\nimplication of inferiority involved.” The operation of the councils of\r\nagriculture is to be a step towards that end. But the statement of policy\r\nis prudently non-committal and the full meaning of “democratic control”\r\nand its implications, so far as agriculture is concerned, receives no\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE LABOUR PARTY’S INDUSTRIAL AND LAND POLICY\r\n\r\n2. A CRITICISM\r\n\r\n    What Capitalism Is—Our Debt to Capitalism—The Alleged\r\n    Defects of Capitalism—Where Reform is Admittedly Needed—The\r\n    Failure of Past Socialistic Experiments—Limits within which\r\n    Nationalization is Practicable—The Different Schemes of Land\r\n    Nationalization—The Taxing-out Scheme—The State Purchase\r\n    Scheme—The Socialistic Confiscation Schemes—The Conceptions\r\n    Underlying Each Scheme—The Disadvantages of State Ownership of\r\n    Land.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe propose now to offer some broad criticisms upon Labour’s Industrial\r\nand Land Policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Capitalism Is\r\n\r\nThe primary object, as we have shown, of the Labour Party is to abolish\r\ncapitalism. What, therefore, do we understand by that? It cannot be\r\nbetter described than has been so admirably done by that distinguished\r\nwriter, Mr. Hartley Withers, in the _Case for Capitalism_, p. 13:\r\n\r\n    “The present system under which we work and exchange our work\r\n    for that of others is that commonly described as Capitalism.\r\n    Under it each one, male or female, can choose what work he\r\n    will try to do and what employer he will try to serve; if he\r\n    does not like his job or his employer, he can leave it or him\r\n    and try to get another. He cannot earn unless he can do work\r\n    that somebody wants to buy, and so he competes with all other\r\n    workers in producing goods or services that others want and\r\n    will pay for. His reward depends on the success with which\r\n    he can satisfy the wants of others. Whatever money he earns\r\n    in return for his labour he can spend as he chooses on the\r\n    purchase of goods and services for his own use or for that of\r\n    his dependents, or he can invest it in opening up a business or\r\n    industry on his own, account, or in shares and debts of public\r\n    companies, and debts of Governments or public bodies; these\r\n    securities will pay him a rate of profit or interest if the\r\n    companies or debtors prosper and are solvent. Whatever money\r\n    he earns by labour or by investment he can, after paying such\r\n    taxes on it as the State demands, hand on to any heirs whom he\r\n    may name.\r\n\r\n    “The system is thus based on private property, competition,\r\n    individual effort, individual responsibility and individual\r\n    choice. Under it, all men and women are more or less often\r\n    faced by problems which they have to decide and, according as\r\n    their decision is right or wrong, their welfare and that of\r\n    their dependents will wax or wane. It is thus very stimulating\r\n    and bracing, and might be expected to bring out the best effort\r\n    of the individual to do good work that will be well paid so\r\n    that he and his may prosper and multiply. If only every one had\r\n    a fair start and began life with an equal chance of turning his\r\n    industry and powers to good account, it would be difficult to\r\n    devise a scheme of economic life more likely to produce great\r\n    results from human nature as it now is; by stimulating its\r\n    instincts for gain and rivalry to a great output of goods and\r\n    services and by sharpening its faculties, not only for exercise\r\n    in this purely material use, but also for solving the bigger\r\n    problems of life and human intercourse that lie behind it.”\r\n\r\nThe capitalistic system dates from the Industrial Revolution (1780-1830),\r\nwhen domestic industry was replaced by factory production. Since those\r\ndays, as Labour was plentiful and ill-organized and capital more\r\ndifficult to obtain, the capitalist occupied relatively to the worker\r\na stronger position in industry. This transient incident is what Mr.\r\nSidney Webb in his _A Constitution for a Socialist Commonwealth of Great\r\nBritain_ describes as “the central wrong of the Capitalist System”:—\r\n\r\n    “But the central wrong of the Capitalist System is neither the\r\n    poverty of the poor nor the riches of the rich: it is the power\r\n    which the mere ownership of the instruments of production gives\r\n    to a relatively small section of the community over the actions\r\n    of their fellow citizens and over the mental and physical\r\n    environment of successive generations. Under such a system\r\n    personal freedom becomes, for large masses of people, little\r\n    better than a mockery. The tiny minority of rich men enjoy,\r\n    not personal freedom only, but also personal power over the\r\n    lives of other people; whilst the underlying mass of poor men\r\n    find their personal freedom restricted to the choice between\r\n    obeying the orders of irresponsible masters intent on their own\r\n    pleasure or their own gain, or remaining without the means of\r\n    subsistence for themselves and their families.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Debt to Capitalism\r\n\r\nLabour’s proposal, therefore, is to abolish capitalism and replace it\r\nby that brand of Socialism known as “nationalization and democratic\r\ncontrol.” We should first realize what we owe to the capitalism which\r\nwe are asked to destroy. Our first debt is certainly liberty. This is\r\nconvincingly worked out by Mr. Harold Cox in his _Economic Liberty_, p.\r\n2. Liberty to possess and use property consistently with the good of the\r\ncommunity, liberty to buy, to sell, to work, to strike, in fact complete\r\nliberty in all economic relations. This is to be surrendered and replaced\r\nby the bureaucratic control of the State Socialist, or the equally\r\nautocratic control under the scheme of the Guild Socialist. Liberty is\r\na prize not hastily to be relinquished. This capitalistic system is not\r\nthe selfish system as described by Labour. It can only exist provided\r\nit supplies commodities and services, of which the community stands in\r\nneed, at prices which the community can afford to pay. That is no light\r\nresponsibility. One of the necessary consequences of any socialistic\r\norganization of industry is that the community must use and pay for such\r\ncommodities as it is convenient and desirable for industry to produce;\r\nunder any socialistic regime, therefore, the consumer, instead of being\r\nan object of regard, becomes a mere wheel in the mechanism of production.\r\n\r\nThe capitalistic system develops energy and thrift, though the former\r\nhas been largely neutralized by the sterilizing effect of Trade Union\r\ndoctrines against output, and the latter frustrated by the inability\r\nof industry as a result of production thus restricted to pay high\r\nwages. Under a socialistic regime the worker is to receive not wages\r\nbut “pay” and whether he works or not. All progress in industry depends\r\nupon initiative and enterprise and the readiness to take risks. To-day\r\nrisks are assumed by the owner of capital and, if they materialize,\r\nthey are borne by him and not by the workers or the community. It would\r\nbe ludicrous to say that either the State under State Socialism or\r\nindustry under any form of democratic control would or could exert the\r\nsame initiative or show the same enterprise as the private capitalist.\r\nEconomic history teems with examples of great industries now employing\r\nthousands of workers which were originally established by capitalists\r\nwho, stubbornly persistent, refused to accept failure and by sheer\r\ndogged enterprise won through. The world has wonderfully prospered under\r\nthe capitalistic organization in industry. We see social conditions\r\nenormously improved, innumerable social reforms effected, the welfare\r\nand well-being of the people prodigiously advanced. Sir Josiah Stamp—an\r\noutstanding authority—said in 1921, as a result of a statistical\r\ninvestigation, “the ordinary person of to-day is four times as well off\r\nin real commodities as the person in the corresponding stage in the\r\nscale in the beginning of the nineteenth century.” During this hundred\r\nyears the population has quadrupled. The lot of the worker steadily\r\nprogressed from 1800 up till 1900, when, in certain industries, there set\r\nin tendencies of retrogression. It has been one continuous record of rise\r\nin standard of living, and in wages, both nominal amount and purchasing\r\npower, due to improvement in production from the introduction of\r\nmachinery, development of food production in new countries, and expansion\r\nof our export trade. This has been largely the result of the capitalistic\r\norganization of industry, and of its ability to meet the demands of the\r\nconsumer, and of the extraordinary elasticity inherent in the system of\r\nadapting itself to varying circumstances.\r\n\r\nWithout the machinery provided by the much-abused capitalist Labour would\r\nto-day be “scratching the ground” to extract a penurious livelihood. The\r\ncapitalistic organization of industry would never have survived, had it\r\nnot been in the main economically sound, and, on the whole, a system\r\nwhich made for the good of society. This is the system which is to be\r\nwholly destroyed by the Labour Party because of certain alleged defects,\r\nand replaced by an untried socialistic regime.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Alleged Defects of Capitalism\r\n\r\nFirst, it is said that under capitalism the incentive stands ethically\r\ncondemned in that an employer is actuated wholly by a desire for his own\r\nprivate profit. I fail to see any turpitude in that motive; an employer\r\ncan only make profit if he succeeds in serving the community. There are,\r\nof course, some—I personally have met very few—employers who deliberately\r\ntry to foist on credulous consumers an adulterated or spurious article.\r\nBut it is exactly for the same motive, namely, for profit, that the\r\nworker serves his employer, or, if that is an unacceptable analogy, that\r\na member of a gang of workers serves his fellow-worker who is head of the\r\ngang and employing him. There are just as many workmen, indeed more, who\r\nare ready to pass off bad work upon their employer as employers prepared\r\nto pass off bad work upon the community.\r\n\r\nAs against this incentive of private profit the Syndicalists would\r\nsubstitute the imaginary incentive that each worker would work for\r\nthe good of his own group of workers; the National Guildist that each\r\nworker would work for the benefit of his Guild of workers, and the State\r\nSocialist that each worker would work for the State. Reduced to its\r\nelements, it means that each worker would, in the end, work for what\r\nhe could get out of it, or if he found that he got the same advantage\r\nwithout working so hard, then he would not work so energetically. The\r\nsuggestion that workers would work more vigorously for the community\r\nor State is so absolutely contrary to my own experience that I find it\r\ndifficult to treat the suggestion with respect. It was never so during\r\nthe war—in Government factories, dockyards, arsenals, there was just as\r\nmuch restriction of production as in the works of private employers, and\r\nconsiderably more strikes. In none of our municipal services is it found\r\nto be a fact. The railway strike of September 1919, while the railways\r\nwere under Government control, is only another illustration of the\r\nfalsity of the suggestion.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Labour under the capitalistic system is bought and\r\nsold as a commodity. That is one of those phrases which expresses\r\nmore than is meant. The lawyer sells his legal advice, the surgeon\r\nhis operative skill, the musician his powers of technique, taste and\r\nexpression just as a person who owns a commodity sells it. I cannot see\r\nany moral degradation whatever in the worker accepting wages any more\r\nthan a private lawyer accepting his salary in a financial house, or a\r\nhouse-surgeon accepting his in a hospital or an organist his in a parish\r\nchurch. All of them are subject to notice terminating their engagements,\r\njust as a manual worker—not probably a week’s notice, but some longer\r\nperiod. The accusation is put even higher and the capitalist is called\r\na thief, in other words, that he is appropriating in the shape of his\r\nown profit something which ought to belong to Labour. This proposition,\r\npalpably untrue, is so generally accepted by the workers that it deserves\r\nsome examination. If a Trade Unionist, say a foreman plater, in one of\r\nour large ship repairing centres, works hard and makes, as he does in\r\nnormal times, a big income, he may do one or two things with it; he may\r\nspend it on his own amusements or in wasteful extravagance; on the other\r\nhand, he may save and invest it, as I have known many do, in a small\r\nindustrial concern in his own district. In the first case he is by common\r\nconsent an honourable, if a foolish, man, in the second he certainly will\r\nnot be called a thief. He has used by investment a part of his wealth\r\nfor the purpose of producing more wealth, and his resultant increase of\r\nwealth is not robbery of the workers in the concern in which his money\r\nis invested. But then he is a member of the Labour movement. Between\r\nsuch a case and the case of the financial house which makes a business\r\nof collecting the savings or surplus wealth of thrifty persons for\r\ninvestment in industry, there is no difference in principle whatsoever.\r\n\r\nCapitalism implies competition, and competition, Labour says, must\r\nbe eradicated out of social and industrial activity. Why competition\r\nshould be a good thing in every walk of human life and provide a\r\nhealthy stimulus, and yet not provide an equally beneficial stimulus\r\nin industrial and commercial affairs is hard to follow. What Labour\r\nreally intends to say is that competition acts so as to depress wages\r\nand lower the standard of living of the worker. That is only one side;\r\ncompetition acts so as to increase demand for commodities and the volume\r\nof employment, and, if production were not restricted, would increase\r\nwages. Then it is said that the capitalistic organization of industry\r\ninvolves economic waste, by which is meant that industry is carried on\r\nless efficiently under private management than it would be either under\r\nGovernment or under “democratic control.” If there is waste it is the\r\ncapitalist who suffers, the Trade Unionist always receives his standard\r\nrate of wages. If there is waste on the employers’ side, as of course\r\nthere is in some badly organized shops, there is greater waste in the\r\nshape of restricted production on the part of the worker. Organization\r\nand efficiency are, of course, essential to industrial progress, but\r\nto suggest that these essential qualities are better obtained under\r\nbureaucratic or democratic control is at variance with our experience\r\nduring the war and of present conditions in Russia where democratic\r\ncontrol has laid the hand of death on industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Reform is Admittedly Needed\r\n\r\nIt must not be assumed that the capitalistic system of organization of\r\nindustry is perfect and needs no reform; unfortunately, it exhibits\r\na number of well-marked deficiencies. First of all, an employer only\r\nemploys a man as long as he desires or finds he can profitably do so, in\r\njust the same way that the workman only works for an employer as long\r\nas he finds it suits him and no better job is forthcoming. One defect\r\ncertainly of the present capitalistic system is the failure of employers\r\nin industry as a whole or of each industry in particular to provide\r\nagainst unemployment. On this matter I have a good deal to say in a\r\nsubsequent part of this book. Again, in the past there was a regrettable\r\ntendency which, in recent years, has happily disappeared amongst the\r\nbest employers, to disregard the human qualities, aspirations, needs\r\nand susceptibilities of the worker, coupled with a neglect to provide\r\neffectively for his welfare and well-being in the works. This, however,\r\nis nothing intrinsic in the capitalistic organization of industry; I have\r\nheard equally bitter complaints by the workers when I have been sitting\r\nas arbitrator in disputes between employees of the “non-capitalistic”\r\nco-operative societies and the societies’ democratic managements.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a complaint against capitalism which, although it\r\nhas been very largely remedied in recent years, yet in normal times,\r\nimmediately prior to the war, certainly existed—that was the insufficient\r\ndistribution amongst the workers of the product of the industry;\r\ncapital in many cases received an undue share of the reward. This was a\r\nshort-sighted policy; for good wages to the workers, provided the workers\r\ngive good output, results in the workers possessing good purchasing\r\npower; and as so many workers are also consumers, this results in a good\r\ndemand for commodities and so is to the benefit of manufacturers, and the\r\ncommunity. But if some employers appropriated by way of profit an unduly\r\nlarge share of the product of industry, the workers did exactly the same\r\nif opportunity presented itself. One has illustrations of this in the way\r\nin which, by agreement between the building employers and the building\r\nTrade Unions, costs were forced up by wage-agreements which largely\r\ncontributed to the shortage of housing and placed the unskilled builder’s\r\nlabourer in a wage-position substantially higher than that of the skilled\r\nengineer tradesman, who normally stands on a higher wage-level.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Failure of Past Socialistic Experiments\r\n\r\nWhen we are discussing on a priori hypotheses the practical operation of\r\nthe elemental motives of average men and women, it is wise to learn what\r\nexperience has to teach us. There have been at least seventy attempts to\r\ncarry secular Socialism into effect, of which five only survived their\r\nfourth year of life. There was the new Harmony Community of Equality,\r\nfinanced and founded in America in 1825 by Robert Owen. One of its\r\narticles of constitution provided that “every member shall render his or\r\nher services for the good of the whole.” It was a disastrous failure.\r\nOwen had supplied lands, houses and the use of capital, giving to some\r\npersons leases of large tracts of land for 2,000 years at a nominal rent\r\nand for moral considerations only. Addressing the settlers in 1827,\r\nhe said: “I find that the habits of the individualistic system are so\r\npowerful that these leases have been, with few exceptions, applied for\r\nindividual purposes and individual gain.” There was also the Brook Farm\r\nPhalanx, established in 1842, with which Emerson was associated; the\r\nWisconsin Phalanx, established in 1844, and the North American Phalanx, a\r\nfew years later.\r\n\r\nThe leading facts and the history of these Socialistic adventures ought\r\nto be read in Mr. W. H. Mallock’s the _Limits of Pure Democracy_, Book\r\nIV, chap. 2, p. 201, where they are set out with much acute criticism.\r\nThe last of these great experiments was in 1893, when William Lane\r\nestablished his “New Australia” in Paraguay. In Lane’s constitution the\r\nworkers were controlled and directed by officials of their own choosing.\r\nThe colony came to sad grief and ultimately decided by vote that every\r\nman should be entitled to dispose of the fruits of his own industry. A\r\nnew grant of land was made by the Government to a large number of the\r\noriginal colonists; they retrieved their failure and became, under the\r\nstimulus of each working for himself, successful farmers. The causes\r\nof the unhappy end of those great adventures are summed up thus by Mr.\r\nMallock (p. 216):—“To speak broadly they may be reduced to two, one\r\nof them inhering in the nature of all collective industry, the other\r\ninhering in the nature of human beings with the sole exception of small\r\nand essentially select minorities. The first of these causes was a want\r\nof ability in industrial direction. The second was a want of any general\r\nsentiment sufficiently strong and persistent to ensure that directions,\r\nif given, should be accepted with submission on the one hand and carried\r\nout with a diligence punctual and sustained on the other, under a social\r\nsystem the essential object of which was to render the conditions of the\r\nworst worker equal to the conditions of the best.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLimits within which Nationalization is Practicable\r\n\r\nLabour, of course, will say that these small experiments have no bearing\r\non the question of the nationalization and control of great industries.\r\nTo some extent they are right. There are, however, certain definite\r\nlimits to successful nationalization. An industry which is confined to\r\nrendering services is a totally different thing to an industry whose\r\nbusiness it is to produce commodities. There is nothing like the same\r\nsevere restrictions on efficiency in the former case as in the latter.\r\nThe services may indeed be of such a character that they can only be\r\nefficiently carried out under the State or under a municipality If\r\nthe service is one the successful provision of which depends upon a\r\nmonopoly being preserved, there may be a case for nationalization; as\r\nillustrative of this, one may take the case of the Post Office. Again, a\r\ncomprehensive service may be necessary, in parts of the country where it\r\nhas to be provided at a loss, in other parts where it can be provided at\r\na profit-the loss in the former case being made good out of the profit\r\nin the latter. Under such conditions nationalization may be the only\r\npossible procedure. Sometimes continental analogies for nationalization\r\nare adduced, but the continental temperament and tradition have been\r\nentirely different from those prevailing in this country. There was never\r\nin Latin countries the same spirit of private enterprise as with us; in\r\nthe former, public opinion relied on the State to provide all services\r\nin the nature of public utilities. Where there has been an opportunity\r\nof comparing the efficiency of services provided by the State with those\r\nprovided by private enterprise, the comparison is always against the\r\nState. One has only to read _German v. British Railways_, by Edwin A.\r\nPratt (P. S. King & Son, 1907), _Historical Sketch of State Railway\r\nOwnership_, by Sir William Acworth, K.C.I.E. (John Murray, 1920), to\r\nrealize some of the drawbacks of nationalization. The Socialist in this\r\ncountry invariably falls back upon the Post Office as a convincing case\r\nof the success of State management, but the business community will\r\nhardly be prepared to accept the Post Office as a conclusive argument of\r\nthe efficiency of nationalization.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Different Schemes of Land Nationalization\r\n\r\nWhat the Labour Party means by “public ownership” of land is not clear.\r\nThe term “nationalization” is equally vague. In reference to land, it\r\nis commonly used to mean some form of “communization,” that is to say,\r\nacquisition and ownership either by the whole community or a section of\r\nthe community. The former is true nationalization, i.e. ownership by\r\nthe nation; the latter is “municipalization,” i.e. ownership by a local\r\nauthority. Municipalization of land has, however, rather disappeared as a\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\nAll land nationalizers assume that ownership embraces two fundamental\r\nrights. (1) The right to draw a revenue from the use of the land, i.e.\r\nto receive the rent. (2) The right to control the way in which the land\r\nshall be used. They describe these two rights as the “right to rent,” and\r\nthe “right of control” respectively. Where land is held in fee-simple the\r\nright to rent and the right of control are usually vested in one and the\r\nsame person, namely the owner. Where, however, the relation of landlord\r\nand tenant has been created by a contract of tenancy, the right to rent,\r\nwhen it exists, is usually vested in the landlord. The right of control\r\nis vested partly in the landlord and partly in the tenant. The landlord’s\r\npowers, partial or otherwise according to circumstances, of controlling\r\nthe uses to which the tenant may put the land, depend upon the contract\r\nof tenancy.\r\n\r\nSchemes of land nationalization fall into one of three classes according\r\nto their effect on the right to rent and the right of control. First,\r\nwhere the whole revenue of the land is ultimately to go to the State,\r\nbut possession and the right of control of the land is to remain as it\r\nis under private ownership. There, transference of land revenues to the\r\nState is to be effected by growing national taxation of land values. This\r\nis the scheme of the school of land nationalizers who follow Mr. Henry\r\nGeorge, and are mainly represented by the English League for the Taxation\r\nof Land Values. It is fully explained in Mr. George’s book, _Progress\r\nand Poverty_, and will be called the “George scheme” or “taxing-out\r\nscheme,” Second, where the right of control of the land is to be taken\r\nfrom private owners and vested in the State by State purchase, but the\r\nowners are to suffer no substantial loss of revenue. They are to receive\r\nGovernment Bonds of such capital value as will produce an annual interest\r\nequal to the net rent of the land in question. This is the plan of the\r\nLand Nationalization Society, of which the late Dr. Alfred R. Wallace,\r\nF.R.S., O.M., was the Chairman. It will be called the “Nationalization\r\nSociety’s scheme” or the “state purchase scheme.” Third, where the\r\npresent owners are to be expropriated, and deprived of the right to\r\nrent, and the right of control, and so lose all or a very considerable\r\nportion of their income so far as derived from land. Socialists other\r\nthan the State Socialists who subscribe to the programme of the Land\r\nNationalization Society advocate this policy. Some of them would allow\r\nthe owners compensation, but nothing like sufficient to maintain their\r\npresent income. For example, the National Guildists would pay trifling\r\ncompensation in State Bonds equal in nominal value to the capitalized\r\nvalue of an annuity for two to three years of the same annual amount as\r\nthe net rent. The Syndicalists, on the other hand, would confiscate the\r\nentire private property in land without any compensation whatsoever.\r\nThese various schemes described under “third” will be called the\r\n“socialistic schemes.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Taxing-out Scheme\r\n\r\nMr. George thus describes his “taxing-out scheme” at p. 288 of _Progress\r\nand Poverty_:\r\n\r\n    “I do not propose either to purchase or to confiscate private\r\n    property in land. The first would be unjust; the second\r\n    needless. Let the individuals who now hold it still retain,\r\n    if they want to, possession of what they are pleased to call\r\n    _their_ land. Let them continue to call it _their_ land. Let\r\n    them buy and sell, bequeath and devise it. We may safely leave\r\n    them the shell if we take the kernel. _It is not necessary to\r\n    confiscate land, it is only necessary to confiscate rent._”\r\n\r\nIn regard to the “George scheme,” the whole point is whether there is any\r\nspecial justification for confiscating an income derived from land as\r\ncompared with other incomes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State Purchase Scheme\r\n\r\nThe object of the “Land Nationalization Society’s scheme” as published\r\nis “to establish public ownership of land by means of fair compensation\r\nbased on its value as ascertained for purposes of taxation.” It is\r\ninsisted that the State should take possession of agricultural land first\r\nand of house property at a later period.\r\n\r\nPublic ownership, it is claimed, will secure:\r\n\r\n(1) That the use of land will be easily obtainable by all classes of the\r\ncommunity without being subject to the veto of any landowner.\r\n\r\n(2) That the best possible conditions of tenancy will be established so\r\nthat all State tenants will have the same security as freeholders have\r\nto-day and full right to the value of the improvements they make.\r\n\r\n(3) That the community will be able to determine in the general interests\r\nof all to what uses the land shall be put.\r\n\r\n(4) That ultimately the whole value of the land will be secured for the\r\ncommon good.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, is only a summarized statement of the alleged benefits\r\nof State purchase. They are expanded into great detail by the Land\r\nNationalization Society in its various publications.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Socialistic Confiscation Schemes\r\n\r\nThe chief characteristic of the “socialistic schemes” is confiscation\r\npure and simple. How exactly that is to be effected depends upon\r\nthe particular school of Socialism; the constitutionalists say by\r\nlegislation; the revolutionaries say by direct action culminating in the\r\nsocial revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Conceptions Underlying Each Scheme\r\n\r\nThe fundamental conceptions underlying the schemes are as follows:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The _Georgites_ contend that the bare land was given by God to the\r\nhuman race but was afterwards stolen by robber barons, or taken by wicked\r\nkings from the people and handed over on fictitious grounds or nefarious\r\nreasons to courtiers who did the royal will.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The _Land Nationalization Society_ builds up the whole of its case\r\nfor State purchase upon this basic axiom:\r\n\r\n“All men have an equal right to live, and as no man can live without\r\nland, it follows that all men have an equal right to the use of the land\r\nthat is necessary to sustain their existence.” Notwithstanding this, land\r\nstill remains private property; the private owner is supreme in regard\r\nto it; he can exclude everyone from it with dire economic results. Only\r\nunder State ownership, says the Nationalization Society, can this be\r\nremedied.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The _Socialists_, that is to say, the National Guildists and\r\nSyndicalists, found their scheme on both the foregoing assumptions, the\r\nSyndicalists in addition claiming that no rent should be paid even to the\r\nState, but that the land should belong outright to, and be distributed\r\namong, the people.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of practical politics the State purchase scheme of the\r\nNationalization Society is of chief moment. Although the Georgites and\r\nthe Socialists are active and vociferous, their respective schemes are of\r\nmuch less relative importance. Even assuming that the land was originally\r\nacquired by private persons by robbery or injustice, the best equitable\r\nanswer to the “taxing-out scheme” is probably that of the Nationalization\r\nSociety:\r\n\r\n    We answer that while the land is _ours_ by every moral right,\r\n    and we propose to assume possession of it by compulsory\r\n    process, we recognize that a very large number of honest men\r\n    (neither robber barons nor their descendants) have invested\r\n    actual earned money in land, either as individuals or as\r\n    members of building, insurance and co-operative societies and\r\n    trade unions.\r\n\r\n    “Therefore, we do not propose to confiscate that money (i.e.\r\n    that portion of the rent which represents the value of the bare\r\n    land) and leave to them what is theirs (i.e. that portion of\r\n    the rent which represents the value of the improvements)” (_The\r\n    Land Nationalizer_, May, 1919, p. 5).\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Land Nationalization Society writes thus:\r\n\r\n    “We who favour compensation justify it on grounds which appear\r\n    to us to be grounds of equity. We say that the landlords of\r\n    the present day did not found the system of private property\r\n    in land, and should not be punished (by spoliation) as if they\r\n    did. The original wrongdoers are dead and past punishments.\r\n    Neither are the present landlords alone responsible for the\r\n    maintenance of the system. That system is supported by the\r\n    well-to-do classes generally, who look upon land as legitimate\r\n    private property, and even by the great mass of unthinking\r\n    landless people who send a majority of landlords and friends of\r\n    landlords to Parliament at every chance they get. If landowning\r\n    is a crime, then the majority of the British people are aiders\r\n    and abettors of it.... We must be prepared to give a fair value\r\n    for the land whether it be held by a duke or a working man.”\r\n    (_State Land Purchase_, by Joseph Hyder, p. 3.)\r\n\r\nThe practical answer to the “George” or “taxing-out scheme” is that it\r\nis not possible to separate the value of the land from the value of the\r\nimprovements on it. Anything which mankind has added to the natural land\r\nis capital and should, according to the George view, be inviolate. In\r\nproposing, as “the George scheme” does, only to allow for “the value of\r\nthe clearly distinguishable improvements made within a moderate time,”\r\ncapital is being confiscated. That is, something is being confiscated\r\nwhich was not stolen. If one form of capital may be confiscated, why not\r\nall forms?\r\n\r\nThe Land Nationalization Society has formulated many objections to the\r\n“George” or “taxing-out scheme” apart from its injustice. They say it\r\nwould be an interminable process, that it would not be effective—witness\r\nthe failure of the heavy land taxation in Canada, New Zealand or\r\nAustralia, to cheapen land or eliminate landlords—that the public would\r\nnot accept it. So many persons are owners of small pieces of land, it\r\nwould tend to increase the number of landlords instead of reducing them.\r\n\r\nThe way in which the advocates of State purchase try to make out their\r\ncase is very simple, and they do it with great ingenuity. They first\r\nendeavour to prove their basic axiom of “the right to live” by appeal to\r\nthe great English common lawyers, writers on Sociology and authorities\r\non Political Economy. Having done that to their own satisfaction, they\r\nproceed to give at length illustrations of alleged despotic and churlish\r\naction on the part of landowners. The favourites are the Highland\r\nClearances and landlordism in Ireland. Then in the same vein they bring\r\nforward a great collection of cases of alleged refusal of land by\r\nlandowners for works of public importance, or exaction by landowners of\r\nwhat is said to be (without any evidence) a wholly unreasonable price for\r\nland for public purposes (see, for instance, Chapter V, “The Extortion\r\nof High Prices for Land” in _The Case for Land Nationalization_, by\r\nJoseph Hyder, Simpkin, Marshall & Co.). All these evils are said to be\r\ndirectly due to private ownership in land. These cases, if they ever\r\nexisted, are amply remedied by recent Acts facilitating the acquisition\r\nof land.[7] Having got so far, every hardship or evil to which a farmer\r\nor agricultural labourer is subject is likewise under the same chain of\r\nreasoning ascribed (without proof) to private ownership in land. If,\r\ntherefore, the basic axiom is to be vindicated, private ownership must be\r\ndone away with. There is no logic in such reasoning, even assuming that\r\nthe basic axiom in its widest extension is sound—as a matter of fact it\r\nis not. All these illustrations show is that the present land system may,\r\nin certain respects, require reform, not that it ought to be abolished.\r\nThe argument makes out no case for the complete eradication of the whole\r\nlandlord system, still less for State purchase. The fallacy lies in the\r\nwholly unproved assumption that State ownership is the only alternative\r\nto an unreformed land system.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Disadvantages of State Ownership of Land\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to state succinctly the many objections[8] to State\r\nownership of land:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The first is the incompetence of the State through a rigid\r\nbureaucratic administration subject to political pressure to manage\r\nefficiently or economically a highly technical industry like agriculture,\r\none whose conditions vary in every district and indeed on every estate\r\n(which is admitted by the Labour Party), or indeed the land on which the\r\ncomplex industry directly depends.\r\n\r\n(_b_) State purchase would entail an enormous addition to our National\r\nDebt which we cannot afford, and for which there is no justification.\r\n\r\n(_c_) If landowners were bought out, it is clear that the State would\r\nhave to make itself responsible for finding annually a vast amount of\r\ncapital for improvements, and also working capital for the very large\r\nnumber of peasant and other smallholding tenants. It would not, and could\r\nnot, do it adequately nor as satisfactorily nor to the same extent as\r\nexisting landowners. If it did, this speculative use of national funds\r\nwould be quite unjustifiable.\r\n\r\n(_d_) If it is desirable to cut up large estates and farms and to\r\nestablish a vast number of peasant holders in the shape of State tenants,\r\nand all the evidence from Ireland and other countries is strongly against\r\nthe expediency of this course, it can be done without the abolition of\r\nprivate property in land.\r\n\r\n(_e_) One thing is certain, that State ownership will not tend to\r\nincrease production, but will have the opposite effect.\r\n\r\n(_f_) It is equally clear that States ownership involves no improvement\r\nof the lot of the agricultural labourer, but rather the reverse.\r\n\r\n(_g_) There is not the land monopoly alleged. This appears from the fact\r\nthat over one-half of the cultivated land in England and Wales consists\r\nof holdings of comparatively small extent—80 per cent, of the existing\r\nfarmers farming holdings of under 101 acres.\r\n\r\n(_h_) Tenant farmers do not want State purchase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE LABOUR PARTY’S POLICY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT\r\n\r\n1. WORK OR MAINTENANCE\r\n\r\n    The Manchester Resolution of 1917—The Memorandum on War Aims,\r\n    1917—The Memorandum on Unemployment after the War, 1917—The\r\n    London Resolution of 1918—The Prevention of Unemployment\r\n    Bill, 1919—Labour’s Recommendations to the Industrial\r\n    Conference, 1919—The Right Hon. A. Henderson’s Addendum—The\r\n    Southport Resolution of 1919—The Resolution of September\r\n    1919—The Recommendations of the Joint Committee on Cost of\r\n    Living, September 1920—Vote of Censure in Parliament, October\r\n    1920—Resolution of December 1920—Labour’s Refusal to Co-operate\r\n    with the Government, 1921—Labour’s Statement of Policy for\r\n    Unemployment, 1921—Manifesto on Unemployment, 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Labour Party claims to have foreseen the present prostration of\r\nindustry, and asserts that it recommended in advance of the disaster\r\ncomplete preventives and remedies which, if they had been adopted, would\r\nhave neutralized the present world-wide conditions of unemployment. The\r\nsuccessive statements of policy issued, and resolutions passed by the\r\nLabour Party and the Trades Union Congress since 1917 on the subject of\r\nunemployment, disprove conclusively any such claim of prescience.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Manchester Resolution of 1917\r\n\r\nAt the Labour Party’s Annual Conference in 1917 a resolution asserted\r\nthat the Government could, if it chose, prevent any considerable\r\nunemployment in this country, by maintaining from year to year a “uniform\r\nnational demand” for labour. This was to be done by co-ordinating the\r\ncarrying out of public works, and of orders for State Departments and\r\nlocal authorities. “To prepare for the possibility of there being\r\nextensive unemployment either in the course of demobilization or in the\r\nfirst years of peace,” the Government was called upon to arrange for\r\nimmediate execution, either directly or through local authorities, of\r\nthe most urgently needed public works. These were described as housing\r\nto the extent of two millions sterling, new schools, roads and light\r\nrailways, reorganization of canals, afforestation, land reclamations,\r\nharbour development, etc. To reduce the risk of adult unemployment it\r\nwas urged that the school age should be raised to sixteen, scholarships\r\nestablished, and hours of labour shortened for young people, and a\r\n48-hour week introduced generally without reduction of wages. It will\r\nthus be seen that Labour, in 1917, in exercise of those powers of\r\nprevision now so amply arrogated to itself, thought that unemployment\r\nafter the war would be so limited in this country that it could be\r\nremedied by the adoption of the simple measures mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Memorandum on War Aims, 1917\r\n\r\nIn London, in December 1917, a _Memorandum on War Aims_ was approved at\r\na Special Conference of the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress,\r\nand in February 1918, was accepted by the Third Inter-Allied Conference\r\nheld in London of Foreign Allied Labour and Socialist organizations. This\r\nMemorandum proceeded in the same strain. Section 5 urged the Socialists\r\nand Labour Parties of every country to press their Governments to\r\nexecute numerous public works, roads, railways, schools, houses, etc.,\r\nat such rate in each locality as would, when superadded to capitalistic\r\nenterprise, maintain a uniform demand for labour and so “prevent there\r\nbeing any unemployment.” Then followed this fallacious proposition: “It\r\nis now known that it is in this way quite possible for any Government\r\nto prevent, if it chooses, the very occurrence of any widespread or\r\nprolonged involuntary unemployment,” and this comment, “if such is\r\nallowed to occur it is as much the result of Government neglect as is any\r\nepidemic disease.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Memorandum on Unemployment after the War, 1917\r\n\r\nThere was also issued, in 1917, a Memorandum called the _Problem of\r\nUnemployment after the War_, adopted by the Joint Committee on Labour\r\nProblems after the War, representing the Parliamentary Committee of the\r\nTrades Union Congress, the Executive Committee of the Labour Party,\r\nthe Management Committee of the General Federation of Trades Unions\r\nand the War Emergency Workers’ National Committee. Its proposals for\r\nthe prevention of unemployment are worthy of analysis. It maintained\r\nthat unless prevented by concerted action there would be considerable\r\nunemployment after the war, and from these specific causes, namely, the\r\ndischarge of munition workers, delay in works changing over from war to\r\npeace production, congestion of ports, demobilization of the Army and\r\nNavy, difficulties in securing adequate industrial capital. Again the\r\nremedy recommended was the maintenance from year to year of a uniform\r\nnational demand for labour by the Government and local authorities giving\r\nout their orders “in such a way as to make them vary inversely with the\r\ndemands of private employers.” The public works that were to be executed\r\nwere much the same as before: housing schemes, water and drainage works,\r\nparks, schools, public libraries, works planned by the Development\r\nCommission and Road Board and held up owing to the war, the development\r\nof agricultural and rural industries on a national and co-operative\r\nbasis, afforestation, and the execution of Government printing postponed\r\nduring the war. The Government was also pressed to encourage works of\r\nwhich the output, like bricks and cement, were necessary for the carrying\r\non of other work, for example, building.\r\n\r\nThere could be nothing plainer than this sentence in the Memorandum:\r\n“It may be urged that no such action would keep up the demand of other\r\ncountries for our products, and thus the export trades might fall off; it\r\nmay be assumed, however, that the principal export trades will certainly\r\nbe busy (coal, machinery, shipbuilding, constructional iron and steel and\r\nall woollen goods) and the home demand for cotton goods is also expected\r\nto be brisk.” It is obvious, therefore, at this date that the Labour\r\nParty never contemplated the present depression in our export trade.\r\n\r\nThe proposals of this Memorandum were in advance of previous\r\nrecommendations. To enable local authorities to execute public works,\r\nlegislation was demanded to facilitate the acquisition of the necessary\r\nland. The Government was to use for national purposes the 200 national\r\nfactories, but for what purpose the Memorandum is eloquently silent. A\r\nsystematic plan of short-time with full wages was to be introduced for a\r\ncertain limited period in Government dockyards, arsenals and factories,\r\nwhen the final adjustment to peace-time conditions was taking place. To\r\nprevent an overstocked adult labour market there was to be no employment,\r\npartial or otherwise, of children under the school-leaving age, which was\r\nto be raised to sixteen, and only part-time employment up to a maximum\r\nof a 30-hour week for young people between sixteen and eighteen years,\r\nthe balance of whose normal working week was to be devoted to physical\r\nand technical training and education. Twenty thousand additional scholars\r\nwere to be trained as school teachers, and additional bursaries granted\r\nto the secondary schools, universities and technical colleges for pupils\r\nfrom the elementary schools, who would otherwise go into industry.\r\nOvertime was to be prohibited, and an 8-hour day to be imposed by statute.\r\n\r\nThe Memorandum claimed maintenance, apart from the Poor Law, for all\r\npersons who were unemployed and for whom no suitable work could be found.\r\nWhere persons were entitled to unemployment benefit from the Trade Unions\r\nthey should receive it and in addition be paid unemployment benefit under\r\nthe Unemployment Insurance Acts; the rate of benefit, under those Acts,\r\nto be increased to a sum to be fixed in regard to the prevailing cost of\r\nliving. Unemployed persons who did not receive benefit under the Acts,\r\nand those who had received it, but had run out of it, should be paid\r\nmaintenance up to a total sum per week fixed in due relation to the cost\r\nof living. Trade Unions paying unemployment benefit were to receive a\r\nGovernment subsidy.\r\n\r\nIn addition the Memorandum called for wide extension of the National\r\nInsurance Act, 1911, and for abolition of its restriction to a limited\r\nnumber of trades, and also for amendment of the National Insurance (Part\r\nII) (Munition Workers) Act, 1916, which brought in munition workers and\r\npersons engaged in metal and chemical industries under the Act of 1911,\r\nand created, it was said, invidious distinctions, as for example, between\r\na worker who would be insured if engaged on a particular article needed\r\nfor use in war, but who would not be insured if engaged on the same type\r\nof article when it was needed for ordinary commercial use. The Memorandum\r\nalso called for amendment of the Act of 1916 in regard to its application\r\nto women, and for the extension generally to women of the National\r\nUnemployment Insurance Scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe London Resolution of 1918\r\n\r\nWhen one passes to the year 1918, we find no indication whatever that the\r\nLabour Party had any premonition of the decline in trade which commenced\r\nin the spring of 1920, or were gifted with any widening vision as to\r\nthe remedies required to meet it. This appears from the proceedings\r\nof the Labour Party’s Annual Conference in that year, and from the\r\nresolution which was passed on the prevention of unemployment. This\r\nresolution, after declaring that the years immediately following the war\r\nwould probably include periods of grave dislocation of profit-making\r\nindustry, called upon the Government to arrange the carrying out of the\r\nnext succeeding ten years’ programme of national and local government\r\nworks, including housing, schools, roads, railways, canals, harbours,\r\nafforestation, reclamations, etc., in such a way as “any temporary\r\ncongestion of the labour market may require.” This resolution solemnly\r\nand without reservation committed the Labour Party to this sweeping\r\ngeneralization:—“Now that it is known that all that is required to\r\nprevent the occurrence of any widespread or lasting unemployment is that\r\nthe aggregate total demand for labour should be maintained year in and\r\nyear out at an approximately even level, and that this can be secured by\r\nnothing more difficult or revolutionary than a sensible distribution of\r\nthe public orders for works and services so as to keep always up to the\r\nprescribed total the aggregate public and capitalist demand for labour,\r\ntogether with the prohibition of overtime in excess of the prescribed\r\nnormal working day, there is now no excuse for any Government which\r\nallows such a calamity as widespread or lasting unemployment ever to\r\noccur.”\r\n\r\nOne can thus realize what, up to the end of 1918, were the sovereign\r\npanaceas of the Labour Party for the prevention of unemployment after the\r\nwar. Let us proceed to trace from and after 1919 the recommendations of\r\nLabour, which it is now said, had they been adopted by the Government,\r\nwould have averted the present conditions of unemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prevention of Unemployment Bill, 1919\r\n\r\nOn March 21, 1919, the Labour Party brought to second reading in the\r\nHouse of Commons their “Prevention of Unemployment Bill,” which embodied\r\nonly the old principles that Labour had been advocating since 1900,\r\nto meet seasonal and cyclical unemployment. The Bill in no sense met\r\nthe present abnormal trade depression, and was rejected. It proposed\r\nto vest in the Minister of Labour all powers and duties in regard to\r\nunemployment insurance, the prevention of destitution, and the relief\r\nof the able-bodied poor. It provided that the Minister should advise\r\nthe Treasury how the various Government works and services should be\r\norganized and apportioned over different seasons of each year, and spread\r\nover different years, so as “to regularize” the national aggregate demand\r\nfor employment, including both public and private employment, as between\r\nthe different seasons of the year, and as between the good and bad years\r\nof a trade cycle, and so, by maintaining at an approximately constant\r\nlevel the national aggregate demand for labour both by private employer\r\nand by public departments, prevent irregularity of employment. It also\r\nput the Minister under an obligation to establish and maintain such\r\ninstitutions as he should deem requisite, in which he was to provide\r\nfor able-bodied persons entitled to public assistance under the Act,\r\nand for whom no suitable situation could be found, such employment of\r\nan educational character and such physical and mental and technological\r\ntraining as he should think fit. All persons admitted to such\r\ninstitutions were to be provided by the Minister with proper maintenance.\r\nThe Bill in addition proposed to constitute as the local unemployment\r\nauthority, who were to act through an unemployment committee, the London\r\nCounty Council in respect of the Administrative County of London, and the\r\ncouncil of every borough and urban district of a population of 20,000 or\r\nover, and the county councils in respect of the rest of an administrative\r\ncounty. Each such council, acting through the unemployment committee, was\r\nto be bound to organize all work—manual or clerical—under its control, so\r\nas to maintain the labour demand in its district at a constant uniform\r\nlevel. In addition, each such council was to be put under obligation to\r\nprovide every person, for whom suitable employment could not be found,\r\nwith such maintenance as its medical officer of health might certify to\r\nbe necessary to maintain such unemployed person and his dependents in a\r\nstate of physical efficiency. All the expenses of the local unemployment\r\nauthorities in carrying out the Act were to be met out of the local rates\r\nto the extent of a 1_d._ rate; all expenses over the proceeds of a 1_d._\r\nrate were to be recovered from the Treasury. There was no limit whatever\r\nto the charge under the Bill[9] upon national funds.\r\n\r\n\r\nLabour’s Recommendations to the Industrial Conference, 1919\r\n\r\nThe next important declaration in 1919 by Labour in respect of\r\nunemployment is contained in the _Joint Report of the Provisional\r\nJoint Committee presented to the Meeting of the Industrial Conference,\r\nCentral Hall, Westminster, April 4, 1919_ (_Parliamentary Paper_,\r\n1920, Cmd. 501). It will be remembered that on February 27, 1919, the\r\nGovernment called together, under the shadow of a miners’ strike, a\r\nConference consisting of representatives of employers and Trade Unions\r\nto consider the industrial situation. That Conference, after expressing\r\nits opinion that any preventible dislocation of industry was always to\r\nbe deplored and in the then existing critical period of reconstruction\r\nmight be disastrous to the interests of the nation, resolved to appoint\r\na Joint Committee to consider, amongst other things, the question of\r\nunemployment and its prevention. A unanimous report was presented by the\r\nJoint Committee, signed by the employers’ representatives and also by\r\nthe Trade Unions’ representatives, the latter representing all the great\r\nTrade Unions, with the exception of the railwaymen, the miners and the\r\ntransport workers.\r\n\r\nIn their Report the Committee stated that they had not had sufficient\r\ntime at their disposal to investigate thoroughly the problem of\r\nunemployment, and therefore would only indicate briefly some of the\r\nsteps which might be taken to minimize it or alleviate it. As aids\r\nin this direction they recommended organized short-time, the working\r\nof overtime only in special cases, postponement, until bad times,\r\nof Government non-urgent contracts, prosecution without delay of a\r\ncomprehensive housing programme, State development of new industries\r\nsuch as afforestation, reclamations of waste lands, development of\r\ninland waterways and, in agricultural districts, the development\r\nof light railways and/or road transport. In addition the Committee\r\nrecommended that the normal provision for maintenance during unemployment\r\nshould be on a more adequate scale, and be wider in its application\r\nthan was provided by the then existing Unemployment Insurance Acts,\r\nand advocated the extension of the National Unemployment Insurance\r\nScheme to underemployment (i.e. workers on short-time or casual\r\nemployment for less than a full working week). They also recommended\r\nthe provision of facilities whereby workers while unemployed and in\r\nreceipt of unemployment benefit could obtain access without payment\r\nof fees to opportunities for continuing their education and improving\r\ntheir qualifications. Child-labour, they advised, should in times of\r\nunemployment be limited, and sickness and infirmity benefits increased,\r\nthe age of qualification for old age pensions reduced and the amount of\r\nthe pension increased.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Right Hon. A. Henderson’s Addendum\r\n\r\nThe Memorandum by the Right Hon. Arthur Henderson, on behalf of the Trade\r\nUnions’ representatives, appended to the Report, dealt further with the\r\nquestion of unemployment. This Memorandum, while in no way disagreeing\r\nwith the Joint Report which the Trade Union representatives had signed,\r\nstated (p. v.) that “the prevention of unemployment and provision\r\nagainst unemployment should have been one of the first thoughts of the\r\nGovernment as soon as the question of industrial reorganization began to\r\nbe considered. The workers fully understood that steps were being taken\r\nto bring into immediate operation, upon the conclusion of hostilities,\r\na permanent scheme both for the prevention of unemployment wherever\r\npossible, and for the maintenance of the unemployed where this could not\r\nbe done.” Further, “we are of opinion that the unequal distribution of\r\nwealth which prior to the war kept the purchasing power of the majority\r\nof the wage-earners at a low level, constituted a primary cause of\r\nunemployment.” Then followed this finding (p. viii): “We are of opinion\r\nthat a general increase in wages by improving the purchasing power of the\r\nworkers would have a general and permanent effect in the direction of\r\nlimiting continuous unemployment by bringing consumption up to something\r\nmore like equilibrium with production.”\r\n\r\nThey accordingly recommended (p. viii) first:—the appointment of a\r\nsub-commission to investigate (1) the whole problem of unemployment\r\nand especially under-consumption as a cause of unemployment; (2) the\r\nallocation of all Government contracts in such a way as to steady the\r\nvolume of employment, and (3) the co-ordination of orders given by\r\nState Departments and local authorities; secondly, the establishment\r\nof a comprehensive scheme of unemployment provision extending to all\r\nworkers on a non-contributory basis, providing for adequate maintenance\r\nof all workers unemployed, and for the making up of maintenance pay\r\nto workers under-employed. All were to receive a flat rate of benefit\r\nwith a supplementary allowance for dependent children. The scheme was\r\nto be administered directly through the Trade Unions, or, where such\r\nwere not available, through the Employment Exchanges, which were to be\r\nplaced under joint committees equally representative of employers and\r\nTrade Unions. The Government were to pay to a Trade Union, providing an\r\nadditional benefit out of its own funds, a subsidy equivalent to 50 per\r\ncent. of the amount expended by the Union on unemployment allowances. In\r\naddition special provision was recommended for the maintenance of widows\r\nwith dependent children and for the endowment of mothers “to prevent\r\ntheir being forced into industry against the interest of society.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Southport Resolution of 1919\r\n\r\nIn June 1919, the Labour Party again considered at its Annual Conference\r\nthe question of unemployment, and passed a resolution that full and\r\nadequate maintenance should be granted by the Government, through the\r\nTrade Unions concerned, for unemployed persons, mothers with dependent\r\nchildren and unable to work, juveniles leaving school and becoming\r\nunemployed below the age of eighteen, women receiving training under the\r\nGovernment’s training schemes, and women whose out-of-work donation had\r\nceased and who had not secured suitable work from the Labour Exchanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Resolution of September 1919\r\n\r\nAgain, in September 1919, the Trades Union Congress passed a resolution\r\naffirming the right of every member of the community to work or to the\r\nreceipt of maintenance, and accordingly called upon the Government to\r\nregulate national and local authorities’ work, and to organize schemes\r\nof “socially necessary” work so as to provide employment, and, failing\r\nthat, to provide adequate maintenance for all workers who could not find\r\nsuitable employment, and facilities for training while they were out of\r\nwork. This resolution contained this interesting sentence: “It deplored\r\nthe inaction of the Government during the past year which had wasted the\r\nresources of the nation by allowing hundreds of thousands of willing\r\nworkers to remain in a state of enforced idleness at a time when the\r\nneeds of the world called imperatively for increased production.”\r\n\r\nThe decline in trade and failure of demand for commodities first appeared\r\nin the summer of 1920, and gradually increased in severity as that year\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Recommendations of the Joint Committee on Cost of Living, September\r\n1920\r\n\r\nIn September 1920, a Joint Committee on the Cost of Living was appointed\r\nby the Labour and Co-operative movements. That Committee made certain\r\nrecommendations which were not original but a mere reiteration of matters\r\nwhich the Government had previously indicated were of prime importance\r\nin connection with the restoration of international trade. The measures\r\nwhich this Committee claimed to be essential for the revival of industry\r\nand restoration of trade were as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) The re-establishment of international peace;\r\n\r\n(2) The definite fixing of war indemnities at reasonable amounts;\r\n\r\n(3) Rehabilitation of currencies;\r\n\r\n(4) In countries where a return to the gold standard was impracticable,\r\nthe establishment of a new parity of exchange;\r\n\r\n(5) The exchange of goods between different countries by barter pending\r\nre-establishment of the machinery of exchange;\r\n\r\n(6) An international loan by the League of Nations to enable impoverished\r\ncountries to resume normal production.\r\n\r\nBut there was nothing in this programme which was not at this time well\r\nunder the consideration of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nVote of Censure in Parliament, October 1920\r\n\r\nOn October 21, 1920 (see _Parliamentary Debates_, Vol. 133, 1115), the\r\nLabour Party unsuccessfully moved a vote of censure in the following\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n    “That this House views with regret the growing volume of\r\n    unemployment, and, recognizing the responsibility of the State\r\n    towards members of the community who are bereft of the means\r\n    of livelihood, is of opinion that every possible step should\r\n    be taken to arrest the decline in trade and industry and to\r\n    provide work or, in default, adequate maintenance for those\r\n    whose labour is not required in the ordinary market.”\r\n\r\nThe current views of the Labour members in respect of unemployment were\r\nvery fully stated, and the parliamentary debate should be read. Shortly\r\nput, their points were these:\r\n\r\n(1) The unemployment problem is a national problem; it can only be\r\nsuccessfully solved by the State; it ought not to be left for local\r\ntreatment by local authorities.\r\n\r\n(2) Work should be found by the Government for every workless citizen,\r\nwilling to work, and, failing that, adequate maintenance.\r\n\r\n(3) The volume of agriculture should be increased and smallholdings\r\nencouraged.\r\n\r\n(4) Trade relations should be established with Russia, Bulgaria, Turkey,\r\nand other former enemy countries.\r\n\r\n(5) The Government should establish new trades and industries in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n(6) Public works should be undertaken, like afforestation, main and other\r\nroads.\r\n\r\nCritically read, the debate seems strangely barren of any really\r\nconstructive suggestions by the Labour Party.\r\n\r\nLater, on December 16, 1920, the Labour Party sent a deputation to the\r\nMinister of Labour to urge him to accept the following propositions in\r\nregard to unemployment:\r\n\r\n(1) That unemployment insurance is no remedy;\r\n\r\n(2) That it is the Government’s duty to provide for the unemployed useful\r\nwork in various Government establishments;\r\n\r\n(3) That a grant should be made to the Distress Committees under the\r\nUnemployed Workmen’s Act, 1905, in order that local schemes for the\r\nprovision of work might be put in hand;\r\n\r\n(4) That the principle of the out-of-work donation granted after the\r\narmistice should be restored for the benefit of every unemployed\r\nperson not covered by unemployment insurance, and that provision should\r\nbe made whereby persons at present unemployed, but not covered by the\r\nUnemployment Insurance Act, would receive benefits under that Act.\r\n\r\nThis last point was conceded by the Government subsequently in the House\r\nof Commons.\r\n\r\n\r\nResolution of December 1920\r\n\r\nOn December 29, 1920, the Labour Party Conference, called to consider\r\nthe report of the Labour Commission in Ireland, proceeded somewhat\r\ninconsequentially to discuss the problem of unemployment in Great Britain\r\nand subsequently passed the following resolution:\r\n\r\n    “That this Conference, realizing that the growing volume of\r\n    unemployment and under-employment is due in a large measure to\r\n    the interruption in world trading following on the war and the\r\n    defective peace treaties, in addition to the folly of British\r\n    and allied policy in relation to the Soviet Government of\r\n    Russia, condemns the British Government for the unwarrantable\r\n    delay in securing peace and opening trade relationships with\r\n    the Russian Government.\r\n\r\n    “The Conference further condemns the Coalition Government for\r\n    failing to make provision for the prevention of unemployment\r\n    and for the proper treatment of unemployed persons; it calls\r\n    attention to the fact that in February 1920, the Labour Party\r\n    in Parliament introduced its Bill for the prevention of\r\n    unemployment, containing provisions for the maintenance and\r\n    training of unemployed persons, which the Government refused to\r\n    accept.”\r\n\r\nThe last paragraph of this resolution is important. It has been customary\r\nin recent years for Socialist advocates to assure the workmen that\r\nunemployment can never exist under any of the types of socialistic\r\norganization of industry, but that it is an evil peculiar to what they\r\ncall the “capitalistic regime,” and that unemployment is merely one of\r\nthe devices of the employer to break down Trade Union conditions and so\r\nlower wages. How exactly the consumer, who, after all, is the person who\r\nreally controls the production of commodities, is to be persuaded to\r\nconsume and pay for more commodities under a socialistic organization\r\nof industry than under a capitalistic system is not-perhaps wisely\r\nso-explained, but the suggestion of the final paragraph is that were\r\nthe present “pernicious economic system” abolished and the Labour Party\r\nin power, then if its Government were unable to provide work it could\r\nand would provide maintenance and, the ordinary worker is told, at full\r\nTrade Union rates of wages. As to how such scheme is to be financed the\r\nresolution is sagaciously silent.\r\n\r\n\r\nLabour’s Refusal to Co-operate with the Government, 1921\r\n\r\nIn January 1921, the Government decided to set up two Committees on\r\nunemployment and invited Labour to join one of the Committees. Labour\r\ntook the view that the terms of reference were too narrow to serve\r\nany useful purpose, whereupon the Government at once expressed its\r\nwillingness to widen the terms, but on January 11, at a Joint Committee\r\nof the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress and the\r\nExecutive Committee of the Labour Party, it was unanimously decided that\r\nLabour would not accept the invitation of the Government to join in any\r\ninquiry into unemployment. The public resentment aroused by that attitude\r\nsoon convinced the Labour movement that it had put itself entirely in\r\nthe wrong, and it tried energetically to put the blame for its decision\r\non the Government. Labour leaders charged the Government with lack of\r\nfrankness and straightforwardness in regard to the terms of reference,\r\nwithout giving any corroborative particulars whatsoever beyond that\r\nunsubstantiated general statement; they contended that co-operation with\r\nthe Government had never led to anything—forgetting entirely the many\r\nbenefits which during the war were secured to Labour both in rates of\r\nwages and conditions of employment wholly through co-operation with the\r\nGovernment. Truly memories were short. Then finally Labour unconvincingly\r\ncharged the Government with failing to keep faith, or, if faith had\r\nbeen kept, with keeping it unwillingly and ungraciously, and only as\r\na result of Labour’s agitation. The first proof adduced in support of\r\nthis latter contention was the action of the Government in regard to\r\nthe Joint Industrial Conference of 1919. The Conference, Labour said,\r\nwas originally called by the Government; the Joint Committee presented\r\na unanimous report which the Conference accepted; the Government took\r\nno action to give effect to the recommendations of the report and the\r\nCommittee ultimately resigned, and the Conference dissolved. The second\r\ncase on which Labour relied was that of the Royal Commission on the\r\nCoal Industry of 1919; the majority findings recommended alteration\r\nof the then existing system of control of the mining industry; “to\r\nthese the Government refused to give effect.” The inaccuracy of this\r\nstatement will be seen from Chapter XIV. The Government would not accept\r\nnationalization. “Labour,” so it was declared, “has lost all faith in the\r\ngood intentions of the Government, and refuses to allow itself to be used\r\nonce again as a smoke screen.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLabour’s Statement of Policy for Unemployment, 1921\r\n\r\nAs a counterblast to the Government’s Committees of January 1921, the\r\nLabour Party in that month produced an elaborate programme to deal with\r\nunemployment. This will be found in a pamphlet entitled _Unemployment: A\r\nLabour Policy_, issued in January 1921. The whole of the suggestions fall\r\nunder two main heads:\r\n\r\n(1) Maintenance of the unemployed and under-employed, and\r\n\r\n(2) Provision of work.\r\n\r\nThe categorical demand was repeated that work should be provided by the\r\nGovernment, and that if work is not, or cannot be, provided, then all\r\nunemployed and under-employed should be fully maintained at the expense\r\nof the State.\r\n\r\nIn regard to unemployment benefit, every one for whom no suitable work\r\nwas available at the Employment Exchanges, or through his or her Trade\r\nUnion, was to be paid maintenance, which, including benefits under the\r\nUnemployment Insurance Acts, should amount at least to 40_s._ per week\r\nfor each householder and 25_s._ per week for each single man or woman\r\nover eighteen, with additional allowances for dependants. Increases\r\nin these rates were subsequently claimed as the year went on. Neither\r\nmaintenance nor benefits under the Unemployment Insurance Acts should\r\nbe limited to any period of time, but should continue as long as no\r\nsuitable work was available. In the case of under-employment resulting\r\nfrom short-time, the maintenance allowance should be of such an amount\r\nas, when added to the actual earnings, would yield a sum equal to the\r\namount of maintenance which the worker would receive if he were totally\r\nunemployed.\r\n\r\nTraining schools were to be provided for women attracted into industry\r\nduring the war but who, after the war, found themselves unable to secure\r\npermanent peace employment. The local educational authorities, assisted\r\nby grants from the Exchequer, were to provide courses of training for\r\nunemployed male workers. To relieve adult unemployment the Board of\r\nEducation should be authorized at any time to raise the school-leaving\r\nage, and should be restrained from discouraging local educational\r\nauthorities from making by-laws raising the age of full-time attendance.\r\nLocal education authorities should be urged to submit fresh schemes for\r\nschools, etc., under the Education Act of 1918. Any exemption from school\r\nattendance below the age of fourteen to be made illegal; local education\r\nauthorities to proceed with schemes of “continuation education”; the\r\nGovernment to increase the number of free places in secondary schools\r\nand provide maintenance allowances to all free-place pupils in need of\r\nthem. The number of free-places in all centres of higher education to be\r\nincreased, maintenance allowances to be given under grant from the Board\r\nof Education to persons holding such places; training centres for young\r\npersons unemployed to be opened by local educational authorities under\r\ngrants from the Board of Education.\r\n\r\n“Socially necessary” work was to be provided for all. This was to be\r\nfacilitated by the withdrawal of juvenile labour, and the general\r\nintroduction of a 44-hour week without reduction of wages, coupled with\r\na drastic regulation of overtime. The work so provided should not be\r\n“relief works,” but of a “socially productive character” carried out\r\nunder regular wage-earning employment by workpeople in the appropriate\r\ntrades. Work merely providing employment for the unemployed without\r\nsocial results was characterized as wasteful for the community and\r\ndemoralizing to the workers.\r\n\r\nThe Labour Party tries of set policy to make the Government the\r\nscapegoat; so the Report delivered itself as follows:\r\n\r\n    “We recognize that the insensate policy of the Government\r\n    during the last two years both in home and foreign affairs has\r\n    brought the nation to the point at which wholesale relief is\r\n    the only alternative to wholesale starvation, and that those\r\n    who suffer by it must be provided for directly out of the\r\n    pockets of those more fortunately situated.”\r\n\r\nIn order to increase the volume of employment the Government was enjoined\r\nto put in hand, at once, as much as possible of its works programme for\r\nthe next decade, and cause commodities ultimately needed by the State to\r\nbe manufactured forthwith; and local authorities and public bodies were\r\nsimilarly called upon to anticipate their requirements. Road improvements\r\nwere demanded on a much larger scale, and afforestation and foreshore\r\nreclamation. Then came the recommendation that the Government should\r\ncompose its differences with the Building Trade Unions by giving them\r\na guarantee of an adequate minimum housing programme for the next five\r\nyears, so as to meet “their reasonable claim for safeguards against\r\nunemployment”—this to induce the Building Trade Unions, who had more\r\nhousing work than they could do, to allow unemployed unskilled men,\r\nmainly ex-service men, to enter temporarily the building trade! The\r\nreport alleged that many raw materials and other necessary supplies\r\nwere being held up by capitalists, for instance, cement, bricks, light\r\ncastings; to remedy this supposititious state of affairs the Government\r\nwas urged to take drastic steps to compel the production of these\r\nmaterials in the required quantities. An enormous amount of work in\r\nrespect of the construction, improvement and repair of railways, roads,\r\nwaterways and harbours, it was said, ought no longer to be postponed.\r\nSchools and other public buildings should be built. The embargoes laid\r\nupon borrowing by local authorities should be removed and loans provided\r\nfor them through the Public Works Commissioners or otherwise by the\r\nState to enable them to carry out local public works. The Government was\r\nrequired to resume through county agricultural committees its war-time\r\npowers to enforce the proper cultivation of land.\r\n\r\nThen follows a series of measures for the restoration of overseas\r\ncommerce. The root of the problem of unemployment lay, it was said, in\r\nthe revival of industry and of commerce abroad. “The Government had\r\nshirked that duty,” and these were Labour’s demands:\r\n\r\n(_a_) An end to be put to wars, and all expenditure on armaments and\r\nsemi-warlike expeditions in this and other countries.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The immediate inception of trade with Russia, and normal political\r\nrelations with the Soviet Republic. The Russian Government was known to\r\nbe ready to supply to this country large quantities of timber, hide,\r\nflax, platinum and gold in payment of extensive supplies which it needed\r\nof railway equipment, means of transport, agricultural machinery,\r\nimplements of all kinds, clothing, boots, and a thousand and one other\r\ncommodities. This necessitated and justified the immediate conclusion of\r\nan effective trade agreement with Russia.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The restoration of production in, and trade with, other continental\r\ncountries, but not under the export credits scheme of the British\r\nGovernment—which is “merely an attempt to enable British manufacturers to\r\npalm off their surplus goods upon foreign countries instead of supplying\r\nthe goods to those countries which they really need.” The ordinary\r\nnormal course of international trade is then described, with this naïve\r\nobservation. “At present, however, conditions in Central Europe are such\r\nthat, without further assistance, it is very doubtful if this normal\r\ntrade transaction would be carried out.” The report is most admirable in\r\nits modesty as to what “further assistance” it recommends. We may assume\r\nthat if a recommendation had been available, that would stand criticism,\r\nit would have been proffered.\r\n\r\nThe only proposals which the Report advocated were as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) The fixing of the German indemnity at an amount which is both\r\nreasonable and practicable in order to end uncertainty and encourage the\r\nre-establishment in Germany of normal production.\r\n\r\n(2) Credits to be provided for “several European countries”\r\n(unfortunately left anonymous), and to be devoted to the production\r\nof commodities of which there is no danger of overproduction, and the\r\nprovision of transport facilities; the granting of these credits to\r\nbe conditional on the removal by the benefiting-state of all barriers\r\nagainst trade and on rehabilitation of its currency.\r\n\r\n(3) All Governments boldly to intervene to arrange on a large scale the\r\nbarter of whole stocks of surplus commodities. “This, while yielding no\r\nprofit to speculators, would do much to revive economic prosperity and\r\nset going the wheels of industry.”\r\n\r\n(4) The reorganization of the continental transport systems and the\r\ninstitution of unified control, under the League of Nations, of the\r\nrailway system between Germany and Russia.\r\n\r\n(5) The encouragement and fullest possible use, for trade transactions,\r\nof the Co-operative movements of the various nations of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Report expressed a halting agreement that large sums of money\r\nwould be required in respect of the maintenance of unemployed and\r\nunder-employed, the undertaking of work of social utility, and the\r\nfinancing of schemes for the revival of British industry and the\r\nrestoration of industry and commerce abroad. It did not attempt to\r\ndiscuss how this money was to be provided; it disposed of the whole\r\nquestion by this facile observation: “We shall be met at once by the\r\ncriticism that sufficient money cannot be found to meet our demands. We\r\ndo not believe it. We refuse to be put off during this grave national\r\ncrisis, imperilling the welfare of the whole population, with pleas of\r\nfinancial stringency.” Reference was made to large sums of money which,\r\nit was stated, were being spent by the Government on unjustifiable\r\npurposes, for example, on expeditions in Mesopotamia, operations in\r\nIreland and in other places. Money, instead of being so expended,\r\nshould be devoted to the relief of unemployment. If such retrenchment\r\nof military and other wasteful expenditure did not yield the total sum\r\nrequired, then, said the Labour Party, “other resources must be tapped,”\r\nbut those resources are not indicated. “While an increasing number of\r\nfamilies are daily sinking into starvation, the well-to-do classes have\r\nsuffered only minor embarrassments. Luxuries must go, if needs be, to\r\nprovide the means of life and livelihood for those in distress.” Hardly\r\na constructive financial scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\nManifesto on Unemployment, 1921\r\n\r\nThe last important announcement was the _Manifesto on Unemployment_\r\nissued by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress\r\nand the National Executive of the Labour Party after the Trades Union\r\nCongress at Cardiff in 1921, “for the information of the Government and\r\nthe public.” It declared, in now familiar language, that unemployment is\r\na national problem, and that the Government is wholly wrong in adopting\r\nmeasures of local treatment. No district, it is asserted, has any control\r\nover, or any responsibility for, its unemployment. To make districts\r\nresponsible is to subject working-class areas of low rateable value to\r\nexcessive and unjust burdens which they cannot bear and which ought in\r\nequity to be spread over the whole country. The Party expressed its\r\nstrong objection to the limited advances made by the State to the local\r\nauthorities in respect of relief works, especially to the necessity\r\nfor so much expenditure being raised by local loans, by that method\r\nplacing, it was said, the burden upon the backs of ratepayers of the\r\nvery areas whose affliction was already the greatest. Once again the\r\nTrades Union Congress at Cardiff reaffirmed what was described as the\r\nfundamental principle—“the duty of the State to provide work or adequate\r\nmaintenance for every willing worker.” Accordingly the Government was\r\nrequired to discontinue countenancing wage reductions, and to stimulate\r\nnormal production by maintaining the purchasing power of the workers and\r\nthereby sustain the whole market. It is also affirmed that sufficient\r\norders for work to relieve unemployment will not be forthcoming except\r\non the basis of national credit. The Government Departments are urged\r\nto anticipate, and now place orders for, their future needs, and the\r\nGovernment itself is recommended to place substantial orders for staple\r\ncommodities with manufacturers, at prices agreed after an examination\r\nof costs, and to export these commodities on credit to continental\r\ncountries needing them, selling them either directly to the Governments\r\nof those countries or to Co-operative Societies or other organizations\r\nin them, and at the same time to arrange for the sale or other disposal\r\nat home of any remaining portions of the stocks of such commodities. In\r\naddition a 40-hour working week should be introduced. This, it is said,\r\nwould result in (i) the maintenance of the morale and efficiency of the\r\npeople; (ii) the maintenance of machinery in working order pending the\r\nreturn of normal trade; (iii) the maintenance and improvement of the\r\nhome trade and the stimulation of foreign commerce; (iv) the saving of\r\nenormous sums on unemployment benefit and poor law relief. So, it was\r\nclaimed, the problem of unemployment could be reduced to proportions\r\ncapable of being adequately dealt with by public works. These formed the\r\nnext consideration. The Government was requested to prepare a list of\r\nschemes of national works in the order of their demand for labour, giving\r\npreference to those most calculated to foster the revival of industry,\r\ncomprehensive housing schemes to be included prominently amongst them.\r\nThe Government’s distinction between schemes of public works as revenue\r\nproducing and non-revenue producing, it was admitted, was sound, and\r\nshould be maintained, but in the case of the former, the Government\r\nshould make a grant of 75 per cent. of the necessary expenditure and\r\nlend the remaining 25 per cent. to local authorities free of interest\r\nfor three years, the rate of interest thereafter being 3 per cent.,\r\nwith arrangements for repayment at stated intervals. In the case of\r\nnon-productive schemes, the Government to make a grant of 90 per cent.\r\nof the necessary expenditure and lend the remaining 10 per cent. to\r\nlocal authorities free of interest for five years, at the end of which\r\ntime interest and repayment should be the same as in the case of the\r\nproductive schemes. “If, however, employment is still not forthcoming\r\nfor all workers, provision for maintenance must be made by means of\r\nunemployment insurance benefits on an adequate scale.”\r\n\r\nIn Part II of this book it will be seen how far the Government has gone\r\nfor the purpose of alleviating unemployment in the directions desired by\r\nLabour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE LABOUR PARTY’S POLICY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT\r\n\r\n2. ITS IMPRACTICABILITY\r\n\r\n    The Unsoundness of the Right to Work—The Failure of Work or\r\n    Maintenance in France—Impossibility of Providing Suitable\r\n    Work—Employment Depends Primarily on Demand—The Farm Colony\r\n    Fiascos.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe utter impracticability of Labour’s principle of “work or maintenance”\r\nis almost self-apparent. The primary cause of unemployment is want of\r\nwork, the result of economic forces, but the cure of unemployment,\r\naccording to Labour, is to be the provision of work by the Government in\r\nthe teeth of adverse economic conditions. The work is to be “suitable\r\nwork,” and obviously must be either (1) the production of commodities\r\nand services which the consuming public will buy, that is to say,\r\nremunerative work, or (2) the execution of public works which, up to\r\nthat time, have not been constructed, but which, although economic\r\ncircumstances have not justified their construction before, are deemed\r\nproper to be carried out if work has to be found for unemployed persons.\r\nTheir appropriate name is “relief works.” The maintenance is to be such\r\nweekly sum as the local medical officer of health deems necessary to\r\nmaintain each unemployed person and his dependants in a state of physical\r\nefficiency. The Unemployed Workmen’s Bill, introduced by Mr. Ramsay\r\nMacDonald in 1907, was the first Bill enunciating the right to work. In\r\n1908-9 similar Bills were introduced by the Labour Party under the same\r\ntitle. In 1910-11-12, Bills for the same object, called The Right to Work\r\nBill, were introduced by members of the Party.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Unsoundness of the Right to Work\r\n\r\nAttempts were made to describe this principle of work or maintenance\r\nas the logical result of the Elizabethan Statutes, under which parish\r\nauthorities were bound to provide work for the unemployed at wages paid\r\nout of a fund collected from persons of substance in the parish, at first\r\nvoluntarily subscribed, but later raised by tax, and were accustomed to\r\ngrant “relief in lieu of labour” to persons out of work, for whom work\r\ncould not be found. Owing to the difficulty of finding work the overseers\r\nresorted largely to the latter alternative. The Labour Party’s Bill,\r\nneedless to say, omitted the stern Elizabethan methods provided by law\r\nfor treatment of the work-shy—whipping, boring through the ear—and for\r\nthose who ran away, imprisonment for life. The social and industrial\r\nabuses to which the system gave rise in the early days of the nineteenth\r\ncentury are well described by Mr. Harold Cox in Chapter 5, “The Right\r\nto Work,” of his book _Economic Liberty_. It is to be feared Mr. Thomas\r\nPearce (p. 57), labourer in husbandry, who was examined before the Poor\r\nLaw Commissioners of 1834, would even to-day experience similar treatment.\r\n\r\n    “Asked whether in his parish there were many able-bodied men\r\n    ‘upon the parish,’ he replied:\r\n\r\n    “_Ans._ There are a great many men in our parish who like it\r\n    better than being at work.\r\n\r\n    “_Ques._ Why do they like it better?\r\n\r\n    “_Ans._ They get the same money and don’t do half so much work.\r\n    They don’t work like me; they be’ant at it so many hours, and\r\n    they don’t do so much work when they be at it. They’re doing\r\n    no good, and are only waiting for dinner-time and night; they\r\n    be’ant working, it’s only waiting.\r\n\r\n    “_Ques._ How have you managed to live without parish relief?\r\n\r\n    “_Ans._ By working hard.\r\n\r\n    “_Ques._ What do the paupers say to you?\r\n\r\n    “_Ans._ They blame me for what I do. They say to me, ‘What are\r\n    you working for?’ I say, ‘For myself.’ They say, ‘You are only\r\n    doing it to save the parish, and if you didn’t do it you would\r\n    get the same as another man has, and would get the money for\r\n    smoking your pipe and doing nothing.’ ’Tis a hard thing for a\r\n    man like me.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Failure of Work or Maintenance in France\r\n\r\nOne would have thought the experience of the French Revolutionary\r\nGovernment of 1848 would have been conclusive as to the right to work.\r\nLouis Blanc had published, in 1839, his great work, _Organisation du\r\nTravail_, in which he preached the right to work and urged on the French\r\nGovernment the advantages of its embarking on industrial production.\r\nThe Government was to raise a large loan, and with it establish and\r\nequip national factories in every branch of industry. Workmen were to be\r\nemployed, but were to determine by popular election the grades of the\r\ndifferent workers. The net profits were to be divided into three parts,\r\none to be distributed equally among the workers, the second to be devoted\r\nto the maintenance of the old, incapacitated and the sick, the third to\r\nprovide capital for extensions and renewals of the industry. The French\r\nGovernment appointed Emile Thomas to set up _ateliers nationaux_, having\r\npreviously issued a decree that the Provisional Government of the French\r\nRepublic bound itself to guarantee the existence of the worker by means\r\nof work and to guarantee work for all its citizens. The comic and the\r\ntragic side of that great adventure are well described in _Histoire des\r\nAteliers Nationaux_, by Emile Thomas, and in _The Right to Work_, by J.\r\nA. R. Marriott, M.P., Oxford University Press, and are too well-known\r\nto require repetition. They proved a disastrous industrial and economic\r\nfailure, which of itself led directly to the revolution of June 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\nImpossibility of Providing Suitable Work\r\n\r\nAt one time Labour proposed that only work should be provided for every\r\nunemployed person, not “suitable work,” but the ludicrous absurdity\r\nof this proposal became too obvious when it was seen to involve, for\r\nexample, the transference of the skilled shipwright or boilermaker\r\nfrom the Tyne or the Clyde to work on afforestation in the Highlands\r\nof Scotland, or on roadmaking, or some other work of which they had no\r\nexperience, in another remote part of the country. Now the demand has\r\nbeen modulated into one for “suitable work,” which, at any rate, looks\r\nmore sensible on paper. Whatever chance, however, there may be of finding\r\nsome work for persons unemployed, there is much less scope for finding\r\nsuitable work. The lines of demarcation, which confine in water-tight\r\ncompartments the work of every trade, are so closely drawn, and the\r\ndetermination of every Trade Union is so inflexible as to allow at no\r\ntime any other person than its own members to engage upon the work of its\r\nparticular trade, that at times of trade depression it is most difficult\r\nto find suitable work. If no suitable work can be found in the district,\r\nit can hardly be suggested that in times of depression shipwrights and\r\nboilermakers on the Clyde, if they are out of work, should be moved to\r\nother places, for example, to the Tyne or the Mersey, where there would\r\nbe, from the nature of things, local men of their own craft available.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmployment Depends Primarily on Demand\r\n\r\nIf workers are employed to produce commodities and services, and nobody\r\nwants to buy them, it is obviously absurd to place workers on that class\r\nof production. On the other hand, if they are called upon to produce\r\ncommodities and services which people do want and are prepared to buy at\r\na remunerative price, those goods and services can, and ought to, be\r\nprovided by the ordinary machinery of industry which is normally engaged\r\nupon their production; to put unemployed upon that work is merely to\r\ncompete with, and undercut, those workers who are ordinarily engaged upon\r\nthat species of output, and throw them out of employment, making the case\r\nno better than before. The truth is, as Mr. Harold Cox so forcibly puts\r\nit in _Economic Liberty_, p. 74:\r\n\r\n    “It becomes clear that we cannot increase the sum-total of paid\r\n    employment unless we also increase the volume of commodities\r\n    and conveniences which all men want. None of the schemes ever\r\n    proposed for State employment for the unemployed do this. They\r\n    are all designed not to produce things that somebody wants,\r\n    but to provide an excuse for paying wages to people who cannot\r\n    find work. In every case the work is made for the sake of the\r\n    workman, and that very fact implies that the work is not wanted\r\n    for its own sake.”\r\n\r\nThat brings us directly to the question of “relief works.” The only\r\neconomic justification for them is, that when, on humanitarian grounds,\r\npayments have to be made out of public or municipal funds for the\r\nmaintenance of unemployed persons and their dependants, it is better,\r\ninstead of giving a dole without requiring any work, to ask for work\r\nwhich may confer some benefit on the community paying wages for it. The\r\nirony of the position is that the Trade Unions always ask that the wages\r\npaid shall be full Trade Union rates, forgetting entirely that the work\r\nis not remunerative work and that it is not at the time wanted by the\r\ncommunity, but only provided by the community at an economic loss.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Farm Colony Fiascos\r\n\r\nWe have had some experience of attempts to provide “remunerative work.”\r\n\r\nThe Hollesley Bay Farm Colony was established in 1905 by the Central\r\nUnemployed Body; the total expenditure on it between 1905 and March\r\n31, 1912, was £178,253, the total realized by sales of produce of the\r\ncolony during the same period was £41,755, showing a net loss during\r\nthat time of £136,498. (See _Sixth Report Central (Unemployment) Body_,\r\n1913, pp. 7 and 16.) Mr. John Burns, President of the Local Government\r\nBoard, speaking in the House of Commons, March 13, 1908 (_Parliamentary\r\nDebates_, Vol. 186, 70), said in regard to the Hollesley Bay colony: “The\r\nlabour and the work of these men is brought into competition with the\r\nlocal market gardeners and farmers, and when I go down to Hollesley Bay I\r\nam confronted with small deputations of professional decent agricultural\r\nlabourers and servants of market gardeners, complaining of the fact\r\nthat our attempt, well-intentioned, charitably inclined, and fed with\r\nState money, on behalf of the unemployed, is dispossessing the decent\r\nagricultural labourer.” The South Ockenden Farm Colony was established\r\nby the West Ham Guardians. Mr. John Burns said, in regard to it: “In\r\nthe whole time that that colony has been in operation—and no one will\r\nbut admit that I have given it the most generous and the most fatherly\r\nassistance—out of the 790 who have gone through that colony, its object\r\nbeing to train men for the land and to take them back to the land, there\r\nis not a recorded instance of the men going back to agricultural work”\r\n(_Parliamentary Debates_, Vol. 186, 70). On the same occasion Mr. Burns\r\nreferred to the Laindon colony established by the Poplar Guardians: “I\r\nsaw an old agricultural labourer between sixty and sixty-five years old,\r\ndigging in a field within 200 yards of the colony, getting 15_s._ or\r\n16_s._ per week”—Mr. Burns had previously mentioned that the average cost\r\nper week per man on the colony was 24_s._—“I said to him, ‘How long does\r\nit take you to dig an acre of land?’ He said, ‘It takes me a fortnight to\r\ndig an acre of that land.’ I went across the rail and found on the public\r\nworks sixty-seven able-bodied men ... taking ten days to dig an acre and\r\na half.” Thus, in the colony each man was digging at the rate of one acre\r\nin 446 days, while the old agricultural labourer on the adjoining land\r\nwas digging one acre in 14 days. It will be remembered that the express\r\nobject of the Central Unemployed Body in setting up these colonies was\r\nto provide productive work for the unemployed. No wonder that Mr. Burns,\r\nwith his great experience, expressed himself in the following terms, July\r\n19, 1906 (_Parliamentary Debates_, Vol. 161, 425):—\r\n\r\n    “I believe that relief works ought to be the last resort of\r\n    any community. They sterilize volition, sap self-reliance, and\r\n    introduce into industry those very conditions of irregularity\r\n    and low pay which we are seeking to remove.... If the works are\r\n    State-aided, charity-fed, tax-founded, or rate-subsidized, they\r\n    will only be a form of public benevolence that will divert the\r\n    right money in the wrong way to wasteful ends with demoralizing\r\n    results. New works unproductive and unremunerative, fed by\r\n    rates and taxes, are about the worst form of relief that can be\r\n    imagined.”\r\n\r\nMr. Burns’s conclusion will be confirmed by every person who has any\r\nexperience of relief works. The work done is per unit immensely more\r\ncostly than if it were done under normal industrial conditions; the men\r\nknow it is not serious work, and therefore do not work.\r\n\r\nIf relief works have to be provided—and the unemployed cannot be left\r\nto starve—what the works shall be, the conditions under which they\r\nshall be executed, the extent to which the State ought to go, raise\r\nextraordinarily difficult questions calling for the nicest judgment.\r\n\r\nIt is wholly unnecessary to emphasize the evil of doles, whatever form\r\nthey take, whether Poor Law outdoor relief or anything else. I have had\r\nmany cases under my personal notice of men who, being offered work at\r\nreasonable rates of pay, refused to take it, stating that they were doing\r\nbetter out of their various payments for unemployment—and they were.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart II\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT LABOUR POLICY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nWAR-TIME LABOUR REGULATION AND ITS EFFECTS\r\n\r\n    Co-operation between Employers and Unions at Beginning of\r\n    War—The Unsettling Effect of Shortage of Labour—The “Treasury”\r\n    Agreements of March 1915—The Limitation of Employers’\r\n    Profits—Failure of Compulsory Arbitration—Effect of Relieving\r\n    Employers of Responsibility for Labour Management—Increases of\r\n    Wages and Prices—Relation of Wages to Cost of Living.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of our industrial difficulties to-day are due to the effect that the\r\nwar, and especially the measures which it was necessary for Government\r\nto take during the war, have had upon the psychology of the workers. To\r\nattempt a description of those measures in their entirety would be wholly\r\noutside the scope of this book; those who wish to study them will find\r\na full and lucid description in _Labour Supply and Regulation_, by Mr.\r\nHumbert Wolfe, C.B.E., shortly to be published by the Oxford University\r\nPress. I am only concerned to deal with them so far as they provide\r\nguidance for future policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCo-operation between Employers and Unions at Beginning of War\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable feature of the early days of the war was the\r\nspontaneous co-operation between employers and workpeople. On August 4,\r\n1914, the Clyde shipbuilding and engineering employers and employees\r\nunanimously agreed to recommend their respective constituents to assist\r\nin every possible way all firms employed on urgent Government work. On\r\nAugust 10, a similar recommendation was adopted by the shipbuilding and\r\nengineering employers and employees on the Tyne. The matter was carried\r\nstill further; on August 25, at a Joint Committee of the Parliamentary\r\nCommittee of the Trades Union Congress, the Management Committee of the\r\nGeneral Federation of Trade Unions and the Executive Committee of the\r\nLabour Party, the meeting resolved that a strenuous effort should be made\r\nto terminate all existing trade disputes, and that whenever new points of\r\ndifficulty should arise during the war, a determined attempt should be\r\nmade by all concerned to reach an amicable settlement before resorting\r\nto a strike or lock-out. The spirit of this resolution was carried into\r\nimmediate effect. In July 1914, there were in existence over 100 trade\r\ndisputes, implicating 72,000 men; this number fell to twenty during\r\nAugust, in which only 9,000 workpeople were concerned; at the beginning\r\nof 1915 the number was reduced to ten, and in February 1915, to none at\r\nall. The number of fresh disputes which arose between August and December\r\n1914, was very small. That showed the effect that clear appreciation of\r\nthe national needs had both upon employers and employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Unsettling Effect of Shortage of Labour\r\n\r\nThis happy state, unfortunately, did not long continue; and looking back\r\nthe reasons are now quite clear. When the war broke out unemployment\r\nwas generally feared, so much so that a Government Committee on the\r\nPrevention and Relief of Distress was appointed which invited mayors\r\nand provosts throughout the country to form local committees to deal\r\nwith unemployment. The Local Government Board urged local authorities to\r\nexpedite public work; even the Director of Army Contracts appended to\r\nGovernment contracts a memorandum advising contractors that in executing\r\nthe work they should arrange for the employment of as large a number\r\nof men as possible instead of working overtime. By December 1915, not\r\nunemployment, but a grave shortage of skilled engineering workmen proved\r\nto be the national difficulty. Various attempts were made to remedy the\r\nshortage; first, by transferring skilled men from commercial work to\r\nmunitions work; next, by obtaining the release of skilled men from the\r\nColours; thirdly, by importing skilled Belgian refugees and mechanics\r\nfrom Canada; fourthly, in some districts, by forming “king’s squads”\r\nor mobile companies to work wherever they were most needed. All these\r\nmethods proved quite inadequate and the sole remaining course left open\r\nwas to make the best use of the skilled men who were actually available,\r\nthat is to say, to remove them from work on which unskilled men or women\r\ncould be employed and up-grade them on to the most difficult skilled\r\nwork which only a tradesman could undertake, or put them as supervisors\r\nover the unskilled labour so brought in. This is what was popularly\r\nknown as “dilution,” but its successful introduction involved a definite\r\nsuspension of Trade Union customs.\r\n\r\nIn the late autumn of 1914, it was discussed at various conferences\r\nbetween the employers’ federations and the unions, but without success.\r\nIn January 1915, the Government entrusted the problem to the Board of\r\nTrade, and in February the Committee on Production under the chairmanship\r\nof Lord (then Sir George) Askwith was appointed to formulate a programme\r\nfor Government action. It is easy, of course, to be wise after the event,\r\nbut it was an unfortunate circumstance, and deprecated by employers\r\nthemselves, that it should, in the first instance, have been left to\r\n“Capital” to propose to the Trade Unions suspension of customs and\r\npractices which the Trade Unions had spent years in establishing, and\r\nwhich were regarded by the average workman as the bulwarks of his trade\r\nrights. All these customs, for example, the limitation of apprentices;\r\nthe restriction on the working of certain machines by skilled men only;\r\nthe remuneration of overtime; the limitation of output; the exclusion of\r\nwomen and also of men who had not served an engineering apprenticeship,\r\nwere designed for the purpose of building up a system under which the\r\nTrade Union craftsman would have a monopoly of his trade, and be secured\r\nas far as possible against unemployment. It was regarded by the men as\r\nthe natural instinct of every employer to break through these rules,\r\nand so, by securing the right to bring in unskilled labour, to reduce\r\nthe standard of wages of skilled men. In spite of all undertakings by\r\nemployers that the alterations in working conditions would be only\r\nfor the period of the war, the workmen were never convinced that such\r\nmeasures were really necessary in the interests of the country or\r\nanything but devices of unscrupulous employers. Had Government in the\r\nfirst instance undertaken the negotiation of these proposals, and not\r\nleft it to the employers, the history of munitions production would have\r\nbeen very different.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Treasury” Agreements of March 1915\r\n\r\nIt was the Trade Unions themselves who represented to the Government that\r\nif anything was to be done in the direction of suspending trade customs,\r\nthe Government would have to take the matter into their own hands. So,\r\nin March 1915, a conference was held at the Treasury, when the Cabinet\r\nmade a direct appeal to the Trade Unions of the country, and concluded a\r\ntreaty known as the “Treasury” Agreement which, had it been successful,\r\nwould have secured for the war period a suspension of strikes and of\r\nall restrictions upon output. The treaty, however, turned out to be\r\ncompletely ineffective, and the cause is illuminating. At the beginning\r\nof March the cost of living had gone up, according to the Board of Trade\r\nstatistics, to 15 to 20 per cent. above the July 1914 figure. There\r\nwas a general outburst throughout the country against profiteering;\r\nLabour reprinted and circulated Mr. Bonar Law’s famous statement that\r\n“well-managed ships to-day are making simply enormous profits, and those\r\nprofits come from the very cause for which the people of this country\r\nare making sacrifices in every direction and even giving their lives”\r\n(_Parliamentary Debates_, 1915, Vol. 69,793). The result was an immediate\r\nincrease in strikes. The following were the stoppages of work reported to\r\nthe Board of Trade:\r\n\r\nNumber of disputes in progress at beginning of 1915, 10.\r\n\r\n    During January 1915   30 fresh disputes.\r\n       ”   February  ”    47   ”       ”\r\n       ”   March     ”    74   ”       ”\r\n       ”   April     ”    44   ”       ”\r\n       ”   May       ”    63   ”       ”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Limitation of Employers’ Profits\r\n\r\nThe Amalgamated Society of Engineers was represented at the Treasury\r\nConference; its representatives, however, had been instructed not to\r\nagree to any scheme until they had reported it to, and obtained upon it\r\nthe instructions of, their Executive Council. On that becoming known\r\nto the Government, the Chancellor of the Exchequer convened another\r\nconference on March 25, 1915, at the Treasury with the Amalgamated\r\nSociety of Engineers, and a further agreement was there signed. At\r\nthe conference the Amalgamated Society of Engineers insisted that the\r\nGovernment should take steps to regulate employers’ profits, arguing\r\nthat it was unfair to prevent the workman from using his tremendously\r\nincreased economic power and at the same time leave employers free to\r\nuse theirs. A supplemental agreement was then made with the Amalgamated\r\nSociety of Engineers containing this clause: “That it is the intention of\r\nthe Government to conclude arrangements with all important firms engaged\r\nwholly or mainly upon engineering or shipbuilding work for war purposes\r\nunder which their profits will be limited with a view to securing\r\nthat benefit, resulting from the relaxation of trade restrictions or\r\npractices, should accrue to the State.” The national need for limiting\r\nemployers’ profits had been emphasized previously by the Committee\r\non Production. This recommendation had the strong approval of Lord\r\nKitchener; speaking in the House of Lords on March 15 (see _Parliamentary\r\nDebates_, 1915, H. of L., Vol. 18,723) he said: “Labour may very rightly\r\nask that their patriotic work should not be used to inflate the profits\r\nof the directors and shareholders of the various great industrial and\r\narmament firms, and we are therefore arranging a system under which\r\nthe important armament firms will come under Government control, and\r\nwe hope that workmen who work regularly by keeping good time shall\r\nreap some of the benefits which the war automatically confers on these\r\ngreat companies.” Negotiations were undertaken by the Government with\r\nvarious armament and shipbuilding firms with a view to the Government\r\ntaking possession of them, but these broke down and the Government\r\nabandoned the idea. Other negotiations to limit, first, dividends, and\r\nthen, alternatively, net divisible profits, also collapsed and nothing\r\ncame of them. The fact that workmen were prevented from forcing higher\r\nwages while employers were left free to make higher profits completely\r\nnullified the “Treasury” Agreements and something had to be done. On June\r\n9, 1915, the Ministry of Munitions was constituted by Act of Parliament.\r\nImmediate steps were taken to draft the Bill which afterwards became the\r\nMunitions of War Act, 1915. The Government appreciated the importance of\r\ngetting the Bill agreed to by Labour, as indeed they ultimately succeeded\r\nin doing. The first point on which Labour insisted was the limitation\r\nof profits of the employers. This was ultimately provided in Section\r\n5. It only applied to “controlled establishments,” and until the later\r\nintroduction of the Excess Profits Duty the owners of non-controlled\r\nestablishments were allowed to make such profits as they thought fit. But\r\nit was shutting the stable door after the steed was stolen. Throughout\r\nthe war, Labour never got rid of the notion that the profits of employers\r\nwere not restricted until Labour had forced the Government to restrict\r\nthem, and that even then the restriction was on a wholly inadequate scale.\r\n\r\n\r\nFailure of Compulsory Arbitration\r\n\r\nThe substantial effect of the Munitions of War Act, 1915, was to give\r\nstatutory force to the “Treasury” Agreements. The obligations which\r\nthe Act imposed upon the owners of controlled establishments were\r\nsubstantially the safeguards for Labour contained in the “Treasury”\r\nAgreements, and upon Labour the provisions contained in those Agreements\r\npreventing stoppages of work. Part I of the Act provided for the\r\nsettlement of labour differences and in certain cases for the prohibition\r\nof strikes and lock-outs, and for compulsory arbitration. It might well\r\nbe thought that the circumstances of the war provided a unique occasion\r\nfor the success of compulsory arbitration, but it was a failure, signal\r\nand complete. A great many Unions at first acquiesced in arbitration\r\nbecause as long as prices continued to rise, advances of wages were more\r\nor less automatically awarded, so as to adjust wages to cost of living.\r\nWhen, however, the Unions refused to go to arbitration, or, if they went,\r\nto comply with the award, it was impossible to make them. If 100,000\r\nmen cease work it is impracticable to prosecute or fine all of them;\r\nto select a certain number soon raises cries of victimization, those\r\nprosecuted are made martyrs, and funds are raised by their colleagues\r\nfor payment of their fines. While the pretence of enforcing awards was\r\nmaintained for a certain time, everybody concerned in the administration\r\nof the Munitions Act knew that compulsory arbitration was a broken reed.\r\nThis was proved in the very month the Act was passed, namely, June 1915,\r\nin the case of the miners’ strike in South Wales, to which reference is\r\nmade on p. 156. But in view of the absolute dead-lock at which collective\r\nnegotiations between employers and trade unions had arrived by the end\r\nof 1914, it was essential for the Government to undertake the general\r\nregulation of labour itself, and the powers for doing so were conferred\r\non the Minister of Munitions by the Munitions of War Act, 1915. Much\r\nadverse criticism has been levelled at the labour administration of the\r\nMinistry, but State regulation was the sole remaining remedy; if this be\r\nremembered, it must be conceded that labour was regulated as efficiently\r\nas circumstances allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nEffect of Relieving Employers of Responsibility for Labour Management\r\n\r\nOne unfortunate, though inevitable, effect of the Munitions of War Act,\r\nand the regulation of labour by the Ministry of Munitions, was the extent\r\nto which employers ceased to manage the labour in their own works. Though\r\nprofits were limited, work was plentiful, and prices ample; they were\r\nassured of business without much effort on their part. In addition,\r\nmany employers resented, and probably not unnaturally, the intervention\r\nof the Ministry of Munitions in labour disputes, and when disputes did\r\narise, instead of endeavouring to settle them with the men, contented\r\nthemselves with reporting them to the Ministry. On the other hand, Trade\r\nUnions found it an easier matter to report disputes to, and discuss them\r\nwith, the Ministry rather than go to the trouble, as before the war, of\r\ndiscussing them with each individual firm. Whatever may have been the\r\nreal cause, the effect undoubtedly was that the passing of the Munitions\r\nAct in 1915, inevitable as it was, has contributed materially to the\r\naloofness which now exists between employers and their workers.\r\n\r\nIt was not in the normal administration of labour by the Ministry of\r\nMunitions that harm occurred—it was when, for political considerations,\r\nparticular action was forced upon the Ministry by politicians, that real\r\ndetriment was inflicted upon industry. An example of that is the famous\r\n12½ per cent. bonus. It is well-known that the Ministry and the Admiralty\r\nwere strongly opposed to that fatal action, but it was thought expedient\r\nfor Government to try and placate Labour not merely in reference to\r\nthen existing difficulties, but with a view to possible political\r\ndevelopments, and so the bonus was given. As Director of Shipyard Labour\r\nof the Admiralty, with over a million men who would be affected by the\r\ndecision, I strongly protested against it. My protest was registered on\r\nthe War Cabinet minutes; I stated it would subject the country to an\r\nextra annual wages bill of 95 million sterling; I was wrong to the extent\r\nof 7 millions, it proved in the end to be 102 millions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncreases of Wages and Prices\r\n\r\nOne important question is the position in which the war left the\r\nworkmen so far as standard of living is concerned; that involves some\r\nconsideration of wages and prices. It is unnecessary for me to discuss\r\nthat at length; Professor Bowley in _Prices and Wages in the United\r\nKingdom, 1914-1920_, Oxford University Press, has now most ably dealt\r\nwith the matter, and reference should certainly be made to that book on\r\nthis crucial question. In his speech on January 29, 1920, at the Annual\r\nMeeting of the London Joint City and Midland Bank, Ltd., the Right Hon.\r\nR. McKenna succinctly described how prices rose:\r\n\r\n    “At the outbreak of war, throughout its course, and right down\r\n    to the present moment, the Government have been large buyers\r\n    of commodities, greatly in excess of their normal demands. The\r\n    first consequence of the immense Government purchases was to\r\n    stimulate production. Machinery was used to its full capacity;\r\n    the number of people employed was greatly increased; women took\r\n    the place of men, and there was a very considerable addition\r\n    to the total national output. But enlarge the output as we\r\n    would, it could not keep pace with the nation’s requirements.\r\n    Demand outstripped supply, and, just as it happens when a\r\n    period of comparative trade depression is succeeded by a\r\n    trade boom, there was a natural rise in prices. At once more\r\n    currency was needed, partly to pay the wages of the larger\r\n    number of workpeople employed, partly because with higher\r\n    prices shopkeepers keep more money in their tills. To the\r\n    extent that more currency was issued the spending power of the\r\n    community was increased. But up to this point the increase was\r\n    not great. A new condition had to be introduced before any\r\n    considerable rise could take place. There must be not merely\r\n    an increase in currency, the total of which, in any case, only\r\n    represents a small part of the public spending power; but,\r\n    far more important, there must be a serious addition to Bank\r\n    deposits. It was not long before this new condition arose.\r\n    To meet the daily growing expenditure the Government had to\r\n    borrow freely from the public, from the banks, and from the\r\n    Bank of England. It is unnecessary to recapitulate the effects\r\n    of this borrowing. Bank deposits increased enormously. There\r\n    was no proportionate increase in the supply of goods and the\r\n    usual consequences followed. Prices began to rise rapidly.\r\n    The rise in prices was next followed by general demands for\r\n    increased wages. As these now rose the cost of production rose\r\n    too, and another turn was given to the screw on which prices\r\n    were steadily mounting. But higher wages have got to be paid\r\n    in legal tender money. In the course of the week the bulk of\r\n    the money paid out in wages comes back through the shops to the\r\n    Banks, and is paid out by them again to meet the next week’s\r\n    requirements. But, as prices and wages rise, not all of it\r\n    comes back, and each week a larger amount is retained in the\r\n    pockets of the people, in the tills of shopkeepers, and in the\r\n    tills and reserves of the Banks.\r\n\r\n    “We may stop here to ask, is there any stage in this process\r\n    at which it would have been proper to limit the issue of\r\n    currency? The main demand for currency is to meet the weekly\r\n    wages bill. If wages increase, whether because more workpeople\r\n    are employed, or because rates are higher, additional currency\r\n    must be brought each week into circulation. If the supply were\r\n    cut off, a substitute would have to be found. At the outbreak\r\n    of war there was not enough legal tender money to satisfy our\r\n    additional requirements and at once postal orders and even\r\n    postage stamps were used to make good the deficiency. If men\r\n    and women are to be employed and paid, means of paying them\r\n    must be found, and an arbitrary limitation of currency would\r\n    merely inflict intolerable inconvenience upon the public.”\r\n\r\n\r\nRelation of Wages to Cost of Living\r\n\r\nIt is customary to measure the cost of living among the working-classes\r\naccording to the basis of the Ministry of Labour. The Ministry works on\r\nan average pre-war working-budget of food, rent, clothing, light and\r\nfuel, and miscellaneous items, and ascertains its cost month by month.\r\n(See _Labour Gazette_, February 1921.) The cost in July 1914, is taken as\r\n100, the greater cost each month since appearing as 100 and something;\r\nthis is called the “index-number.” What the Ministry does, therefore, is\r\nto measure the average increase in the cost of maintaining the pre-war\r\nstandard of living of the working-classes; it does not, however, take\r\nin account any modification of the standard, which, of course, was\r\ncustomary; as for instance margarine used when butter was not obtainable.\r\nLord Sumner’s Committee on the Cost of Living to the Working Classes\r\n(_Parliamentary Paper_, 1918, Cd. 8980), showed by actual investigation\r\nthat the index-numbers of the Ministry did not then represent current\r\nconditions, but were too high. On the other hand, the Joint Committee on\r\nthe Cost of Living[10] is of the opinion the figures are under-estimates.\r\nAll these matters are discussed very fully in the book by Professor\r\nBowley, who gives his own modified index-numbers. Professor Bowley\r\nsums it up in these words: “There can be no doubt that some sections,\r\nespecially the worst paid of the working-classes, were better off in\r\nthe summer of 1920 than before the war, and it is probable that other\r\nsections were worse off. It is not possible to decide whether the average\r\nof all wages, measured in purchasing power, had risen or fallen.” If,\r\nhowever, one takes the wages in certain trades, for example, railways,\r\nmining, and engineering, and compares them with the cost of living since\r\nJuly 1914, they appear in the following relation:\r\n\r\n    ----------+---------+----------+--------+--------+--------------------\r\n              | Ministry| Professor|        |        |\r\n              |of Labour| Bowley’s | Railway| Miners’|    Engineers’\r\n              | Cost of | Modified |  Wages.| Wages. |      Wages.\r\n              | Living  |  Index   |        |        +--------+-----------\r\n              | Index.  | (p. 106) |        |        |Skilled.|Unskilled.\r\n    ----------+---------+----------+--------+--------+--------+-----------\r\n    July 1914 |   100   |    100   |   100  |   100  |   100  |   100\r\n      ”  1915 |   125   |   (120)  |   110  |   113  |   110  |    —\r\n      ”  1916 |   145   |   (135)  |   120  |   129  |   111  |    —\r\n      ”  1917 |   180   |   (160)  |   155  |   136  |   134  |   154\r\n      ”  1918 |   205   |    180   |   195  |   187  |   173  |   213\r\n      ”  1919 |   210   |    185   |   225  |   224  |   199  |   255\r\n      ”  1920 |   252   |    220   |   280  |   260  |   231  |   309\r\n    ----------+---------+----------+--------+--------+--------+-----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nNORMAL GOVERNMENT LABOUR POLICY\r\n\r\n    Government Departments Concerned—Conciliation and\r\n    Arbitration—Whitley Councils—Industry’s Own Conciliation\r\n    Machinery—State Conciliation Machinery—Statutory Minimum\r\n    Wages—Employment Exchanges—The Work of the Ministry of Labour.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the creation of the Ministry of Labour in 1916, a general\r\nsurveillance of labour conditions was maintained by the Chief Industrial\r\nCommissioner’s Department of the Board of Trade. The Ministry of Labour\r\nwas formed in 1916 and absorbed the Chief Industrial Commissioner’s\r\nDepartment, and took over also from the Board of Trade the administration\r\nof Unemployment Insurance, Trade Boards and Labour Exchanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment Departments Concerned\r\n\r\nThe Statutes under which the Ministry of Labour acts are: Conciliation\r\nAct, 1896, and Industrial Courts Act, 1919, in relation to conciliation\r\nin, and settlement of, labour disputes; Labour Exchanges Act,\r\n1909—establishment and administration of Employment Exchanges;\r\nUnemployment Insurance Acts—insurance against unemployment; Trade Boards\r\nActs, 1909-1918—fixing of statutory minimum rates of wages. In addition,\r\nthe Ministry has a number of temporary duties such as the training of men\r\ndisabled in the war and of youths whose apprenticeship was interrupted\r\nby war service. Certain other branches of labour legislation are\r\nadministered by other Government Departments as shown below: (1) The\r\nFactories and Workshops Acts and allied legislation dealing with the\r\nhours of employment of women and young persons, the health and safety\r\nof the workers, dangerous and unhealthy trades, etc., and the Shops\r\nActs, regulating the hours of employment of shop assistants, by the\r\nHome Office; (2) Employment so far as dependent on the Education Acts,\r\nby the Board of Education; (3) The Mines Acts, regulating the hours and\r\nconditions of employment of persons employed underground in coal mines,\r\nby the Board of Trade (Mines Department); (4) The Health Insurance Acts,\r\ndealing with the insurance of workpeople against sickness, and the\r\nWorkmen’s Compensation Acts, dealing with compensation in the event of\r\naccidents arising out of, and in the course of, a workman’s employment,\r\nby the Ministry of Health.\r\n\r\n\r\nConciliation and Arbitration\r\n\r\nThe general machinery for settlement of industrial disputes in this\r\ncountry by conciliation and arbitration is composed of (1) conciliation\r\nmachinery within the industry, (2) State machinery. The former consists\r\nof voluntary machinery comprising (i) Joint Industrial Councils—these\r\nbeing bodies upon which organized employers and workpeople are equally\r\nrepresented, set up in a number of industries in accordance with the\r\nrecommendations of a Committee appointed in 1916 and presided over by\r\nthe Right Hon. J. H. Whitley, M.P., now the Speaker of the House of\r\nCommons; (ii) permanent voluntary conciliation boards—an older form\r\nof joint body equally representative of employers and workpeople, but\r\ndiffering from the Joint Industrial Councils in that the conciliation\r\nboards tend to confine their activities mainly to questions of wages\r\nand working conditions while the Councils take into consideration\r\nall matters appertaining to the industry; (iii) recognized procedure\r\narranged by organizations of employers and workpeople, not having a\r\nformally constituted conciliation board, providing for the discussion of\r\ndifferences as and when they arise.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhitley Councils\r\n\r\nUp to the end of 1921 Joint Industrial Councils had been established in\r\n73 industries and services; 15 are at present in suspense; 1 has been\r\nabsorbed by another Council. In addition, there are 10 active Interim\r\nIndustrial Reconstruction Committees in trades to which the Whitley\r\nScheme cannot as yet be fully applied owing to lack of organization.\r\nThe Joint Industrial Councils and Reconstruction Committees at present\r\nfunctioning cover about 3¾ million workpeople. The Whitley Scheme\r\ncontemplates the establishment, under the National Joint Industrial\r\nCouncils, of District Councils—equally representative of employers and\r\nemployed—and Works’ Committees, comprising management and men in equal\r\nnumbers, and many such bodies have been formed. The activities of Joint\r\nIndustrial Councils have been directed largely to the settlement of\r\nwages claims and the adjustment of working hours, two problems forced\r\ninto special prominence by the abnormal economic conditions of the past\r\nfew years. But other questions of working conditions, e.g. overtime\r\npayments, payments for holidays, walking-time allowances, out-working and\r\nsubsistence allowances, fines for late arrivals have also been discussed\r\nby the Councils. Some have considered the problem of unemployment and\r\narrangements for contracting out of the National Unemployment Insurance\r\nScheme; others have prosecuted statistical investigations and research\r\ninto their particular industries; all of them have considered questions\r\nof welfare in conjunction with the Home Office; certain of them have\r\nconsidered some commercial matters which affect their industries. The\r\nGovernment agreed to regard a Joint Industrial Council as the Standing\r\nConsultative Committee for its industry, and in a number of instances\r\nmatters such as the foregoing have been discussed on the initiative of\r\nthe Government. A few Joint Industrial Councils do not deal with wages\r\nquestions, viz., building, boot and shoe, paper making, printing, and\r\nmetallic bedsteads, as machinery for the settlement of wages existed in\r\nthese trades before the Councils were established and it was thought by\r\nthe industries better to continue such machinery. Certain industries\r\nin which organization of employers and employed is well developed,\r\nsuch as iron and steel, coal, cotton, engineering, shipbuilding, have\r\nnot favoured the formation of a Joint Industrial Council. In them\r\nconciliation boards or some well-recognized machinery is in existence for\r\nthe settlement of disputes.\r\n\r\nThese facts show the results which have attended the efforts of the\r\nMinistry of Labour, acting in tactful co-operation with the employers and\r\nemployed in various industries, to set up Joint Industrial Councils.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndustry’s Own Conciliation Machinery\r\n\r\nA unique feature of industrial evolution in the United Kingdom has been\r\nthe establishment of permanent voluntary Conciliation Boards in very many\r\nindustries, by agreement between employers and workpeople, unsupported by\r\nlegal enactment, and depending solely for their success on the goodwill\r\nof the parties. Such Boards have existed for many years past. The Board\r\nestablished in the Nottingham glove and hosiery industry in 1860 is\r\nprobably the first example of permanent machinery in any industry for\r\nthe systematic treatment of labour disputes. There is a large number of\r\nConciliation Boards in existence. The value of Conciliation Boards (as of\r\nJoint Industrial Councils) depends on their ability to prevent stoppages\r\nof work rather than on power to settle strikes or lock-outs which may\r\nhave already taken place. In most cases, the rules of Conciliation Boards\r\nprovide that no stoppage of work shall be permitted pending consideration\r\nof the difference by the Conciliation Board—in some cases, the rules\r\nstate that, if a stoppage of work has occurred, the Board will refuse\r\nto discuss the matter until work has been resumed. The membership of\r\na Board consists usually of equal numbers of representatives of the\r\nemployers’ associations and of the Trade Unions, parties to the agreement\r\nestablishing the Board. Accordingly, it not infrequently happens that\r\nthe two sides of the Board are equally divided on the question brought\r\nbefore them, and the efficacy of a Board as an instrument for composing\r\ndifferences depends largely upon the steps normally adopted for resolving\r\nsuch a dead-lock. The rules of some Conciliation Boards contain a clause\r\nproviding that, in the event of failure of the parties to effect a\r\nsettlement of a dispute, application shall be made to the Ministry of\r\nLabour for the appointment of an umpire, arbitrator or conciliator. The\r\nchanged conditions during the war, and the special war-time provisions\r\nwhich were necessary for dealing with disputes, had a remarkable effect\r\nupon the forms of conciliation machinery in this country, with the result\r\nthat, in several important industries (e.g. building), the machinery is\r\nunder revision.\r\n\r\nAn illustration of the working of Conciliation Boards is afforded by\r\nthose in the iron and steel industries, which, although now under\r\nreconsideration in some districts, have been in existence for many\r\nyears. In them the remuneration of the majority of the workpeople is\r\nregulated by sliding scales under which wages rise and fall in accordance\r\nwith prescribed advances or reductions in the selling price of the\r\nmanufactured article, this price being ascertained by accountants at\r\nspecified intervals. Although the general adjustment of wages is the\r\nmain object, other useful functions are exercised in these trades by\r\nthe Boards. Amendments of the sliding scale, alterations in method of\r\nworking, fixed rates for special classes of work, variation of prices\r\naccording to difficulties in manufacture, and other similar questions\r\nhave come under the consideration of the Boards. The Conciliation Boards\r\nin the manufactured iron and steel trades show a great similarity in\r\nconstitution and procedure. They are composed, not of representatives of\r\nemployers’ and workpeople’s associations, but of one representative of\r\nthe workpeople and one of the employers from each of the works affiliated\r\nto the Board. Their methods of procedure are alike in affording\r\nopportunities for the parties to a dispute to arrive at a settlement by\r\nthemselves, the services of the Board not being sought until other means\r\nhave failed. Their rules stipulate that individual causes of complaint\r\nmust first be discussed between the aggrieved workmen and the employer\r\nor his representative. In all cases, except that of the South Wales Iron\r\nand Steel Wages Board, the rules provide that, failing a settlement, the\r\nquestion shall then be discussed between the workman, accompanied by his\r\nBoard representative, and the employer or his representative. In the case\r\nof some of the Boards, questions which have passed this stage without\r\na settlement are referred to a Standing Committee, and it is only on\r\nthe failure of this Committee to effect a settlement, that matters are\r\nbrought before the Board itself.\r\n\r\nFor many years the boot and shoe industry has been covered by a series\r\nof Local Conciliation Boards existing in all the centres of the\r\nindustry—questions affecting the industry as a whole being dealt with\r\nat National Joint Conferences presided over by an independent Chairman\r\nappointed by the Ministry of Labour. Each Local Board appoints a\r\nCommittee of Inquiry consisting of two manufacturers and two workmen; in\r\ncase of disagreement, each side of the Board elects an Arbitrator to whom\r\nis remitted for arbitration any dispute referred to the Board and which\r\nthe Board is unable to settle. Should the two Arbitrators not agree the\r\nquestions are referred to an Umpire appointed by themselves or by the\r\nMinistry of Labour. The rules of the Local Conciliation Boards provide\r\nthat the procedure to be followed in cases of dispute between an employer\r\nand his workmen shall be as follows: (_a_) the workmen shall first bring\r\nthe matter before the employer or foreman; (_b_) should they not be\r\nable to agree the representatives of the Employers’ Association and the\r\nrepresentatives of the Workmen’s Union shall endeavour to settle the\r\nmatter in dispute; (_c_) if these representatives are unable to arrange\r\nterms the Secretary of the Board shall forthwith advise the Committee of\r\nInquiry of the dispute; (_d_) in the event of the Committee of Inquiry\r\nbeing unable to settle the dispute it shall be referred to the Board,\r\nand, failing a decision, then to the Umpire or Arbitrators, who shall be\r\nasked to give their decision within seven days from the date of hearing.\r\nThis conciliation scheme is the most important of the few to adopt the\r\nsystem of financial penalties.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Conciliation Boards, there is a variety of\r\narrangements which, although not coming within the definition of a\r\nConciliation Board, provide definite procedure for the consideration\r\nand settlement of differences. Two examples may be given: the highly\r\norganized cotton industry has not adopted conciliation board procedure,\r\nbut the “Brooklands” Agreement, signed in 1893, at the termination of\r\nthe great contest, provided for many years machinery for settlement of\r\ndisputes in the spinning branch of the industry. This Agreement has\r\nnow been superseded by new provisions for avoidance of disputes. As\r\nregards other sections of the industry, the principal agreement is that\r\nexisting between the North and North-East Lancashire Cotton Spinners\r\nand Manufacturers’ Association and the Northern Counties’ Textile\r\nTrades Federation. Under this agreement, the procedure is similar to\r\nthat adopted in the case of the Brooklands Agreement and provides for\r\na meeting of representatives of employers and operatives in the branch\r\nof trade affected; if no settlement is arrived at, the dispute is to\r\nbe brought before a joint meeting of the members of the Employers’\r\nAssociation and the Amalgamated Association of Trade Unions formed in the\r\nsection concerned; if this meeting fails to effect a settlement, then\r\nthe matter is to come before a joint meeting of representatives of the\r\nManufacturers’ Association and the Northern Counties’ Federation. Until\r\nall these steps have been taken and have failed, no strike or lock-out\r\nnotices are to be given. An important feature is a provision that, in\r\ncases of stoppages of work, meetings of the representatives of the\r\nsignatories shall be held at intervals of four weeks in Manchester until\r\nthe dispute has been settled.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Conciliation Boards have not been adopted in the engineering\r\ntrades. The principal agency for conciliation in these trades is that\r\nafforded by the “Terms of Settlement” signed in 1898 on the termination\r\nof the great dispute which had commenced in the previous year. This\r\nagreement, revised in 1907, provides, _inter alia_, for the discussion\r\nof grievances in the first instance by employers and workpeople or\r\ntheir representatives. Should a settlement not be effected by this\r\nmethod, a local conference of employers’ and workpeople’s associations\r\nmay then be called to consider the matter, and if the question still\r\nremains unsettled, it can be referred to a central conference between\r\nthe Executive Board of the Employers’ Federation and the Executives of\r\nthe Trade Unions signatory to the agreement. No stoppage of work is\r\npermissible until this procedure has been fully carried out. An agreement\r\ndated May 20, 1919, amplified the previous agreements by the recognition\r\nof shop stewards and the institution of Works’ Committees.\r\n\r\nThis voluntary machinery (i.e. permanent voluntary conciliation boards\r\nand recognized procedure for discussion) covers a number of the\r\nprincipal trades of the country, such as building, coal mining, iron\r\nand steel, engineering, shipbuilding, cotton, boots and shoes. Before\r\nthe war, there were some other industries of considerable importance in\r\nwhich Conciliation Boards or other permanent machinery did not exist,\r\npresumably owing to lack of organization of the parties, e.g. dockers,\r\ncarters, seamen, agricultural workers. This has to some extent been\r\nremedied during and since the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nState Conciliation Machinery\r\n\r\nSupplementary to the Whitley Councils, voluntary conciliation boards\r\nand similar procedure, which are responsible for the settlement of the\r\nbulk of the differences that arise, there exists the State machinery—on\r\nthe one hand, the Industrial Court; on the other hand, the Trade Boards\r\nfor poorly organized trades. The Industrial Courts Act, 1919 (which\r\nfor practical purposes embodies the Conciliation Act, 1896), defines\r\nthe Government’s powers of intervention in industrial disputes, such\r\nintervention being necessary in cases where the joint machinery is not\r\nadequate or where the joint machinery has failed to effect a settlement.\r\nThe Act sets up a permanent Court of Arbitration,[11] to which recourse\r\ncan be had by parties to industrial disputes if both parties to the\r\ndispute consent. Although permanent provision for voluntary arbitration\r\nis thus made by the establishment of the Industrial Court, it has been\r\nthe policy of the Ministry of Labour, if not always the practice of\r\nthe Cabinet, that trade disputes should be settled as far as possible\r\nby negotiation between Employers’ Associations and Trade Unions. When\r\nthis fails or a Joint Industrial Council, or a Conciliation Board\r\ncannot arrive at an agreement, the Industrial Court is an independent\r\nauthoritative tribunal to which such differences can be referred.\r\n\r\nShould the parties so desire, a dispute can be referred by the Minister\r\nof Labour under the Act either to a single arbitrator appointed by him\r\nor to a special Board of Arbitration composed of members selected by the\r\nparties from panels of persons appointed by him to act on these Boards.\r\nReference to the Industrial Court is, however, the normal procedure. A\r\ndispute may be referred for settlement under the Industrial Courts Act\r\nonly after the exhaustion of all available means for conciliation already\r\nexisting in the trade. Under the Industrial Courts Act, the Minister\r\nhas power to establish a Court of Inquiry to investigate the causes and\r\ncircumstances of any industrial dispute, whether the dispute exists or is\r\nmerely apprehended; moreover, to this course the consent of the parties\r\nis not required. These Courts have no power to settle the dispute by\r\narbitration, but are restricted to making a report which serves to put\r\nbefore the public an impartial account of the merits of the case, with\r\npossibly a recommendation as to the best course to be pursued to effect a\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Ministry of Labour is to place the prime responsibility\r\nfor the harmonious working of industry upon the employers and employed\r\nin each industry, and only to intervene when negotiations between the\r\nemployers and the Trade Unions have broken down, and then merely for\r\nthe purpose of bringing them together again and trying to promote a\r\nsolution of the difficulty acceptable to both sides. Since the armistice,\r\nthe industrial situation has been peculiarly difficult, and in certain\r\ndisputes, there has been a political as well as an industrial element\r\nwhich would have made a settlement almost impossible whatever machinery\r\nexisted, but on the whole it may be claimed that the existing policy of\r\nthe Ministry of Labour has been fully justified by the results.\r\n\r\n\r\nStatutory Minimum Wages\r\n\r\nVoluntary conciliation machinery can function successfully only in\r\nthose trades where both employers and workpeople are sufficiently\r\nwell-organized to enable a collective agreement to be made effective.\r\nThere must always remain a large section of industry which is poorly\r\norganized and for which other means are required for the proper\r\nregulation of conditions. State action has accordingly been found\r\nnecessary to enable the less well-organized trades to fix minimum wages\r\nand to enforce proper observance of them; this has been done by means of\r\nTrade Boards. The Trade Boards Act of 1909 was passed with the avowed\r\nobject of eradicating the evils of “sweating”; four trades only were\r\nincluded under the Act, but power was given to the responsible Department\r\n(then the Board of Trade) to bring additional trades under the Act from\r\ntime to time by Provisional Order. In 1918, an amending Act was passed\r\nsubstituting procedure by Special Order for procedure by Provisional\r\nOrder and modifying the description of the trades which could be brought\r\nunder the Acts. The Minister of Labour is empowered to extend the Trade\r\nBoards Acts to trades to which the Acts do not already apply, if he\r\nconsiders there is no effective machinery in them for the regulation\r\nof wages, and that, in view of the rates of wages prevailing in them,\r\na Trade Board is desirable. For this purpose an investigation into the\r\nconditions in the industry is first made and, if there be a _prima facie_\r\ncase for the application of the Acts, the Minister gives notice of his\r\nintention to make a Special Order under the Acts. A period of at least\r\nforty days must be allowed, in which, if objections are received, the\r\nMinister must order a public inquiry to be held by some person not in\r\nGovernment employment, unless he decides to amend or withdraw the order,\r\nor unless the objections are merely frivolous. On receiving the report of\r\nthe inquiry, the Minister then decides whether he should make an Order\r\nwith a view to establishing the proposed Trade Board or not.\r\n\r\nA Trade Board consists of an equal number of representatives of employers\r\nand of workpeople in the trade, to whom are added a neutral chairman\r\nand two or four persons unconnected with the trade, who are known as\r\n“appointed members.” Where there is any organization among the workpeople\r\nor employers, the Trade Unions and employers’ associations are asked to\r\nnominate representatives. Where there is no effective organization, the\r\nonly practicable method is for the Minister to nominate members selected\r\nto represent the various types of work done in the trade and the various\r\ndistricts where it is carried on. The number of members varies according\r\nto the needs of the trade. Where women are largely employed in the trade,\r\nat least one of the “appointed members” must be a woman.\r\n\r\nA Trade Board must fix a minimum rate or rates of wages for time-work.\r\nWhere no other rate has been fixed, piece-workers must be paid at rates\r\nsufficient to yield to an ordinary worker at least as much money as the\r\nminimum time-rate. It also has power to fix general minimum piece-rates,\r\na guaranteed time-rate for piece-workers, a piece-work basis time-rate\r\non which piece-work prices must be based, overtime rates, and for this\r\npurpose the Board has power to declare what is the normal number of\r\nworking hours per week in the trade. A Board can, if it thinks fit, fix\r\nminimum rates of wages for all classes of workers throughout its trade,\r\nor, if it chooses, fix only a general minimum time-rate, and leave other\r\nrates to be settled between the employers and workpeople themselves. When\r\na rate has been fixed, every employer in the trade must exhibit the Trade\r\nBoard’s notice, giving full particulars of the rate, in his factory, or\r\nin the place where work is given out. Any employer who pays wages at less\r\nthan the minimum rate is liable to a fine of £20 for each offence and to\r\na further fine of £5 for each day after his conviction on which he fails\r\nto pay the legal rate. Any worker who thinks he is not receiving the rate\r\ndue to him may complain to the Minister of Labour or to the Trade Board.\r\n\r\nThe number of Trade Boards at present in existence is 44. Of these 5\r\nare for England and Wales, 5 for Scotland, and 34 for Great Britain.\r\nBy May 10, 1922, 30 Boards had been set up in Ireland. These Boards\r\ncovered in all approximately 3 million workpeople. The Trade Boards are\r\nindependent bodies, though they are financed and staffed by the Ministry\r\nof Labour and though their rates are subject, as described above, to\r\nconfirmation by the Minister. The Minister of Labour has announced his\r\nintention to introduce legislation dealing with the recommendations of\r\na Committee appointed in September 1921, under the chairmanship of Lord\r\nCave, to inquire into the working and effect of the Trade Boards Acts\r\n(_Parliamentary Paper_, 1922, Cmd. 1645). A statement of the Government’s\r\nnew policy appears at p. 286 of the _Labour Gazette_ for July 1922.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmployment Exchanges\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Labour is responsible for the administration of the\r\nEmployment Exchanges established under the Labour Exchanges Act, 1909,\r\nwhich now number over 400 in Great Britain. The work of the Exchanges\r\nfalls under two main heads, viz., that of bringing together employers\r\nrequiring workpeople, and workpeople desiring employment, and that of\r\nadministering the National Unemployment Insurance Scheme. As illustrating\r\nthe amount of work performed by the Exchanges during the seven years 1914\r\nto 1920 inclusive, the average number of yearly placings was 1,360,000.\r\nThe organization of the Exchanges provides a ready means of bringing\r\na demand for labour from any part of the United Kingdom into touch\r\nimmediately with a supply in any other part. Railway warrants are issued\r\nby the Exchanges in necessitous cases subject to a signed undertaking\r\nbeing given, either by the workman or his prospective employer, to repay\r\nthe amount involved.\r\n\r\nWomen are dealt with in a separate department of each Exchange, which,\r\nin all but the very smallest Exchanges, is in charge of a woman officer\r\nand is staffed by women. The administration of unemployment insurance has\r\ngreatly increased the work of the Exchanges in connection with women.\r\nUnder the old Insurance Acts about 500,000 women were insured against\r\nunemployment, but this number has been increased to 2,750,000 under\r\nthe Unemployment Insurance Act of 1920. Since the war, in addition to\r\ndealing with industrial and commercial occupations, the Exchanges deal\r\nwith private resident domestic service as a permanent part of their\r\nwork, and also with applicants who are desirous of obtaining employment\r\nover-seas. They co-operate with the Central Committee on Women’s Training\r\nand Employment in selecting women for training courses. In all these\r\nmatters, and in interviewing and advising unemployed women, valuable\r\nassistance is rendered by the Women’s Sub-Committees of the Local\r\nEmployment Committees. Boys and girls under the age of eighteen are dealt\r\nwith in a special department of each Exchange, except in the case of the\r\nsmallest Exchanges. In about 250 areas, Juvenile Employment Committees\r\nhave been set up in connection with Juvenile Departments of Exchanges.\r\nThese Committees have been appointed under the Labour Exchanges Act,\r\n1909, the Education (Choice of Employment) Act, 1910, or the Education\r\n(Scotland) Act, 1908.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, the Exchanges were very largely used by the Government\r\nfor the purpose of organizing the supply of labour for munitions and\r\nessential services. The various measures included schemes for (1)\r\nregistration and enrolment so that skilled and other essential workers\r\ncould be removed from one part of the country to another, (2) the\r\ntemporary release of serving soldiers for munitions and essential work,\r\n(3) the supply of substitutes to enable more workers to be recruited in\r\nthe army from essential industries and services, and (4) the recruitment\r\nof women workers for munition work.\r\n\r\nThe Juvenile Employment Committees consist of representatives of\r\neducational and industrial interests in the districts, together with\r\nother persons especially concerned in promoting the welfare of boys and\r\ngirls. In the year 1917, the Minister of Labour decided to associate with\r\neach Employment Exchange a Local Employment Committee (at first known as\r\na Local Advisory Committee) to secure for the Exchange the full benefit\r\nof local knowledge and to bring it into close touch with employers and\r\nworkpeople in the district. Local Employment Committees are composed of\r\nequal numbers of representatives of employers and workpeople, together\r\nwith a certain number of additional members (not exceeding a third of the\r\ntotal membership) who are not necessarily connected with industry—among\r\nthe additional members representation of ex-service men is provided for.\r\nThe Chairman is nominated by the Minister and the Committee themselves\r\nappoint a Vice-Chairman. It is one of the most important duties of these\r\nCommittees to keep a close watch over the state of employment in their\r\narea. Where the local unemployment is severe, it is open to them to urge\r\nupon local authorities and private employers the need for widening the\r\nfield of employment where necessary, and also to advise the Minister with\r\nregard to any difficulties which might be removed by departmental action.\r\nAt the present time the Committees assist in the selection of men from\r\nthe Exchange registers for employment under schemes devised to relieve\r\nabnormal unemployment. _See_ pp. 187 and 191.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Work of the Ministry of Labour\r\n\r\nThe Committee on National Expenditure[12] (see _Parliamentary Paper_,\r\n1922, Cmd. 1581) proposed to abolish the Industrial Relations Department\r\nof the Ministry of Labour. They observe that “with the knowledge that, in\r\nthe end, there will be Government intervention, neither side will have\r\nthe same incentive to make the final proposals which might lead to a\r\nsettlement of the dispute.” This appears to me an exceedingly hazardous\r\nproposal. Anyone with experience of industrial disputes knows that\r\noccasions occur when reason disappears, tempers rise and responsibility\r\nvanishes, and neither side will meet the other. It is essential in such\r\ncircumstances for a Government Department to act the go-between if the\r\ncommunity is not to suffer. At some time intervention is imperative, and\r\nit is a question whether it should be that of the Ministry of Labour\r\nworking on a consistent policy or of the Cabinet in Downing Street which,\r\nlacking the industrial experience of the Ministry, is apt to settle a\r\ndispute on any policy, but this question I discuss later at length. The\r\nCommittee on National Expenditure found that, so long as unemployment\r\ninsurance is on the present basis, Labour Exchanges are required as\r\nagencies for checking payments of unemployment insurance benefits,\r\nbut not as Labour Exchanges; they recommended that if unemployment\r\ninsurance by industry could be secured that the Labour Exchanges should\r\nbe abolished. It is quite clear that that cannot be done, nor does the\r\nCommittee recommend it to be done while the present National Unemployment\r\nInsurance Scheme continues. If insurance by industry is found to be\r\npracticable, it may be necessary, from motives of economy, to abolish the\r\nExchanges. Apart from that justification it would be, I think, greatly to\r\nthe national detriment to do so. While an employer cannot take all his\r\nlabour through the Exchanges, employers generally learned during the war\r\nto appreciate their value. Trade Unions started by being suspicious of\r\nthe Exchanges, largely because the local delegate of an organized Trade\r\nUnion regarded it as an important piece of patronage to supply labour of\r\nhis trade to employers in his district, and he considered the exercise\r\nof that patronage as no unimportant factor affecting his re-election.\r\nAlthough in certain districts, no doubt, Exchanges can be abolished, in\r\nthe main industrial centres their continuance is essential particularly\r\nfor trades which are ill-organized.\r\n\r\nI can say from my own practical experience during the war that the\r\nmunitions industries could not have been conducted without the expert\r\nservices rendered by the Labour Exchanges. As Chairman of the Clyde\r\nDilution Commission and of the Tyne Dilution Commission, as Commissioner\r\nfor Dilution on the Mersey and in Barrow-in-Furness, as Director of\r\nShipyard Labour, I worked in the closest touch with them. Their officers\r\nwere invariably men known to, and respected by, local employers and Trade\r\nUnions, and possessed a complete grasp of district labour conditions. The\r\nwork they did in the early days of the war, both in connection with the\r\nMinistry of Munitions and the Admiralty, in settling labour differences,\r\nis as notable as it is unknown. They formed the nucleus on which the\r\nlocal labour staffs of the Ministry of Munitions and the Admiralty were\r\nultimately built up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT LABOUR POLICY FOR THE COAL INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n    Pre-war Conditions—The South Wales Strike of 1915—Government\r\n    War-time Control—The Sankey Commission—The Mining Industry Act,\r\n    1920—The Strike of October 1920—The Strike of April 1921—The\r\n    Failure of Part II of the Act of 1920—Royalties—Summary of\r\n    Government Policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPre-war Conditions\r\n\r\nThe relationship between employers and employed in the coal industry has\r\nbeen more profoundly modified during the war than in any other great\r\nnational industry. Before 1914, there existed the Coal Mines Regulation\r\nActs, 1887-1908, and later the Coal Mines Act, 1911, which consolidated\r\nand re-enacted with amendments many earlier Acts dealing with employment\r\nin mines, payment of wages, and other matters affecting mining. The Act\r\nof 1908 limited the hours of work underground to eight per day exclusive\r\nof one winding. By the Coal Mines (Minimum Wage) Act, 1912, provision\r\nwas made for the fixing of minimum rates of wages for miners in each\r\nmining district by Joint District Boards of mine owners and miners.\r\nBefore the war, and indeed up to September 1917, wages were expressed\r\nat varying percentages above district basis rates, which had been fixed\r\nat various times in the different districts. In one district, Durham,\r\nthe percentages varied with the selling price of coal. This system was\r\nintroduced into Northumberland also in 1914. A similar system was at\r\none time in operation in South Wales, but had been abandoned before the\r\nwar. In October 1912, the Miners’ Federation adopted the Nationalization\r\nof Mines and Minerals Bill for constituting coal-mining a Government\r\nindustry to be worked by a Government Department. Then came the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe South Wales Strike of 1915\r\n\r\nThe South Wales miners gave notice to terminate on June 30, 1915, the\r\npeculiar agreement under which, since March 1910, their wages had varied\r\nwithin a minimum of 35 per cent. and a maximum of 60 per cent. above the\r\nbasis rate of 1879, according to the selling price of large coal f.o.b.\r\nin Welsh ports. When coal sold between 14_s._ and 14_s._ 9_d._ per ton,\r\nwages were 50 per cent. above the 1879 basis, and they were raised or\r\nlowered by negotiation for each 1_s._ up or down in the price. In March\r\n1913, wages had reached the maximum and had remained there. The prices of\r\nWelsh coal in 1915 on yearly contracts, on which the bulk of the business\r\nwas done, were 18_s._ to 19_s._ per ton, prices for other coal being up\r\nto 35_s._ per ton. The South Wales miners demanded a new standard 50 per\r\ncent. over the 1879 basis; abolition of the maximum; a new minimum 10 per\r\ncent. above the new standard to be paid when the average selling price\r\nof large coal was at or below 15_s._ 6_d._ A selling price of 15_s._\r\n6_d._ meant, under the 1910 agreement, wages 57 per cent. above the 1879\r\nbasis—and under the claim meant wages 65 per cent. above that basis. The\r\nrest of the miners in Great Britain had claimed a war bonus of 25 per\r\ncent. on earnings, and Lord St. Aldwyn had awarded 17½ per cent., which\r\nwas accepted. The South Wales miners’ chief purpose was to establish a\r\nhigher minimum as against a post-war depression in trade, and to secure\r\nduring the war higher wages as coal mounted in price. Negotiations\r\nbetween owners and miners broke down—the former agreed to, the latter\r\nrefused arbitration—the Navy relied on South Wales for coal—a strike was\r\nimminent. Mr. Runciman, the President of the Board of Trade, offered the\r\nSouth Wales Miners’ Executive generous terms which the Executive accepted\r\n“as the basis of negotiations,” viz., a new standard 50 per cent. above\r\n1879 provided that the alteration of the standard should not in itself\r\neffect an immediate change in wages; abolition of the maximum and minimum\r\nof 1910; and the levelling up of rates of certain men. The men rejected\r\nthese terms—Mr. Runciman very properly would go no further. Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge then secured the issue of a Royal Proclamation under the Munitions\r\nof War Act, 1915, making it an offence punishable under that Act to take\r\npart in a strike in the South Wales mining industry, whereupon 200,000\r\nmen promptly struck work by way of reply. Mr. Lloyd George himself went\r\nto Cardiff and the strike was settled by the Government giving to the\r\nminers practically all they had asked, with full indemnity against their\r\nbreach of the Munitions Act. It was the first time the Government had,\r\nmeasured its strength against organized Labour and the Government’s\r\ncapitulation had a far-reaching repercussion. Compulsory arbitration was\r\ndiscredited and by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment War-time Control\r\n\r\nThe nation’s dependence on coal was manifested early in the war; output\r\nfell as miners loyally responded to the call for men; prices rose as\r\ndomestic consumers competed with munition industries for fuel. Early in\r\n1915 exports of coal had to be curtailed by Government—in July 1915, the\r\nPrice of Coal Limitation Act had to be enacted, limiting the price to be\r\ncharged for coal at the pit’s mouth. Our Allies began to protest against\r\nthe price charged to them for coal, and coal-owners, exporters and\r\nshipowners agreed voluntarily with the Government to limit the price of\r\nAlly coal. But that did not go far enough, and ultimately in 1917 under\r\nD.O.R.A., powers were conferred on the Board of Trade to regulate prices,\r\nand the distribution and transport of coal both for home and Ally use.\r\n\r\nTrouble continued to develop in the South Wales mines, and the supply\r\nof essential steam coal was in danger. The Government accordingly took\r\nover, from December 1, 1916, control of the South Wales coal-field,\r\nand as, elsewhere, industrial and transport difficulties were causing\r\ngreat anxiety, they also took over, from March 1, 1917, the rest of the\r\ncoal-mines in the country, and constituted a Coal Mines Department.\r\nThe actual management of individual mines was left to their respective\r\nowners, the Department directing them how to dispose of their supplies\r\nso as best to meet the needs of the country. It was inevitable that as\r\ncontrol of the mines had been transferred to the Government, the wages of\r\nmine-workers could be a matter no longer for district adjustment but for\r\nnational settlement by Government, and, since 1917, this was the course\r\nadopted. It is unnecessary to go into the question of miners’ earnings,\r\nthey will be found in the volume of Appendices to the Coal Industry\r\nCommission’s Report (_Parliamentary Paper_, 1919, Cmd. 361, pp. 55 and\r\n109). An admirable comparison as between 1914 and 1920 is contained in\r\nProfessor Bowley’s book, _Prices and Wages in the United Kingdom_. The\r\npoint to be noticed is that after 1917 wages were paid really out of a\r\nnational pool consisting of the aggregate profits of the coal industry\r\nwith the national exchequer behind them. As a result of control, some\r\ncoal-owners, from their position and circumstances, realized large\r\nprofits; others suffered considerable losses. To provide compensation\r\nfor the latter, under an agreement made between the mine-owners and the\r\nCoal Controller, scheduled to, and confirmed by, the Coal Mine Control\r\nAgreement (Confirmation) Act, 1918, a fund was provided by pooling a\r\nprescribed percentage of excess profits. The disparity in the relative\r\nprofit-making capacity of firms which had always existed was of course\r\nmaterially intensified by control; before the war it had not, however,\r\nmaterially affected industrial conditions. Events soon proved the\r\nimpracticability of continuing the 1918 compensation provisions. There\r\nhad existed arrangements for securing supplies of coal to our Allies\r\nat prices approximating to those charged in this country for inland\r\nconsumption—these were terminated in 1919, and the prices of export coal\r\nimmediately mounted. Some coal-owners, who were granted export permits,\r\nrealized large profits; others, who had previously suffered loss owing\r\nto their being restricted to inland trade, continued to labour under\r\nheavy financial difficulties, which were made still more onerous by the\r\nreduction of the price of household coal by 10_s._ per ton in December\r\n1919. To maintain the compensation arrangements of 1918 would have\r\ninvolved the State in heavy subsidies, as a large share of the export\r\nprofits would have been left in the owners’ hands, and loss, for which\r\ncompensation would have to be paid, would still have been inflicted on\r\ncollieries producing for the home market. The Coal Mines (Emergency) Act,\r\n1920, was accordingly passed, which repealed the Act of 1918 from April\r\n1, 1919, and provided a new fund from which compensation was to be drawn\r\nfor collieries working at a loss, but into this fund all excess profits\r\nwere to be paid, and not a percentage only, as in the case of the 1918\r\nfund.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sankey Commission\r\n\r\nThe shortage of coal, of labour and of transport in 1918, when the German\r\noffensive was at its height, led to the rationing of coal, gas and\r\nelectricity, which continued for about two years. After the Armistice,\r\nin November 1918, trade activity increased, the industrial demand for\r\ncoal grew, and the domestic demand as well, when demobilization was\r\naccelerated. The Coal Mines Department only just managed, with the\r\ngreatest difficulty, to secure an equitable distribution of coal, and\r\nthis it accomplished with great efficiency. These difficulties were\r\nincreased by the miners’ threat to strike in the beginning of 1919\r\nunless demands for increased wages and reduced hours were conceded. The\r\nGovernment replied by passing the Coal Industry Commission Act, 1919,\r\nwhich set up a Commission under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Sankey.\r\nThe Interim Report of the Commission (_Parliamentary Papers_, 1919, Cmd.\r\n84, 85 and 86) recommended a national increase of 2_s._ per shift to all\r\nadult colliery workers, a 7-hour day underground and 46½ hours per week\r\nfor surface workers as from July 16, 1919. These recommendations were\r\nput into operation by the Government. Section 1 (_f_) of the Act required\r\nthe Commission to inquire into “any scheme that may be submitted to, or\r\nformulated by, the Commissioners for the future organization of the Coal\r\nIndustry, whether on the present basis, or on the basis of joint control,\r\nnationalization, or any other basis.” On this matter the Commission\r\npresented four reports (see _Parliamentary Papers_, 1919, Cmd. 210 and\r\n360): (1) by the Chairman; (2) by the Labour representatives; (3) by the\r\nrepresentatives of coal-owners and employers in other industries, except\r\nSir Arthur Duckham, and (4) by Sir Arthur Duckham. Reports (1) and (2)\r\nrecommended nationalization of the industry; report (3) acquisition of\r\nroyalties by the State, the continuance of private enterprise coupled\r\nwith the establishment of Pit Committees representative of management and\r\nminers, and District Councils and a National Council representative of\r\ncoal-owners and miners—for the purpose of discussing working conditions\r\nand other questions in the settlement of which both parties are\r\ninterested; report (4) recommended State acquisition of royalties, the\r\ndistrict unification of colliery interests to be worked through District\r\nCoal Boards, on which the workers would have some representation, with\r\na Pit Committee at each mine. Each of the four Reports recommended the\r\nsetting up of a Mines Department.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mining Industry Act, 1920\r\n\r\nThe Government announced, in August 1919, that they could not accept\r\nthe policy of nationalization, but intimated their readiness to apply\r\nthe Duckham scheme, but the owners and the miners objected to this.\r\nSubsequently, the Government put forward a scheme which was ultimately\r\nincorporated in the Mining Industry Act, 1920, providing a compromise\r\nmainly on the principles of Report (3)—that of the representatives on\r\nthe Commission of the coal-owners and employers in other industries.\r\nThis provided for (1) regulation, for a period not exceeding one year\r\nfrom August 31, 1920, of the export of coal, and of the pit-head price\r\nof home coal and bunker coal for coastwise shipping; (2) the future\r\nordering of the industry on a permanent basis, by the co-ordination of\r\nall the Government’s powers and duties in regard to mines and minerals\r\nin the hands of a single Department—the Mines Department of the Board of\r\nTrade created by the Act; (3) the grant to the mine-workers of a greater\r\nvoice in the ordering of the industry by means of representation on\r\nPit and District Committees and Area and National Boards, and (4) the\r\nconstitution of a fund to be applied for purposes connected with the\r\nsocial well-being, recreation and conditions of living of workers in or\r\nabout the mines and for research and mining education. The Government\r\nalso decided that the control of the coal industry, which had been\r\nessential as a war-measure, should be removed as soon as export prices\r\nfell to something approximating to the inland price. A start was made, in\r\nJune 1920, in the direction of freeing the distribution of inland coal\r\nfrom restriction by placing it in the hands of local committees of the\r\ncoal trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Strike of October 1920\r\n\r\nConsistently from the beginning of 1920, the Miners’ Federation had\r\nadvanced new wages claims—the complicated details of which will be found\r\nin the _Labour Gazette_ for August, September, October and November\r\n1920. They contended that their wages had not kept pace with the cost of\r\nliving—that the coal trade was able to afford the increases claimed—that\r\nif wages had been nationally governed by price, as they used to be\r\nlocally governed, either expressly or virtually, all districts would\r\nhave received a considerable rise in wages. It was strongly argued\r\nthat the Sankey National Award of 2_s._ was intended to improve the\r\npre-war standard of living of the miners, and not to meet war-time\r\nincreases in cost of living—a contention for which it is hard to see\r\nthe justification. Negotiations broke down, and a miners’ strike began\r\non October 18, 1920, and continued till November 4, 1920, when it was\r\nsettled on terms agreed between the Government, the Mining Association\r\nand the Miners’ Federation. The first clause of the Agreement was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “(1) Recognizing that on the increased production of coal there\r\n    depend not only the prosperity of all who are engaged in the\r\n    coal industry, but also the welfare of the nation and the cost\r\n    of life of the people, and having in view that this urgent need\r\n    can only be met if the miners and mine-owners throughout the\r\n    country work together cordially for this common purpose; and\r\n    further, having regard to the necessity of setting up machinery\r\n    for regulating wages in the coal trade so as to get rid of\r\n    present anomalies and provide against future difficulties,\r\n\r\n    “The Mining Association and the Miners’ Federation solemnly\r\n    pledge themselves to make every effort to achieve these objects.\r\n\r\n    “To that end they shall:\r\n\r\n    “(_a_) Co-operate to the fullest extent to obtain increased\r\n    output, and for this purpose will arrange to set up district\r\n    committees and a national committee;\r\n\r\n    “(_b_) Proceed forthwith to prepare a scheme for submission to\r\n    the Government at the earliest possible moment, and not later\r\n    than March 31, for the regulation of wages in the industry,\r\n    having regard, among other considerations, to the profits of\r\n    the industry, and to the principles upon which any surplus\r\n    profits are to be dealt with.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Strike of April 1921\r\n\r\nProlonged negotiations then took place between owners and men under this\r\nsettlement. These revealed a fundamental difference: the owners were\r\nclaiming to return to the old district basis of wages; the miners were\r\ninsisting on continuance of a national pool and the national settlement\r\nof wages as under control. No agreement had been concluded when all\r\nremaining Government control was terminated on March 31, 1921, by the\r\nCoal Mines (Decontrol) Act, 1921. In spite of failure to agree, both\r\nminers and owners indicated their willingness to do all possible to\r\navoid a stoppage. A conference took place, on March 30, 1921, between\r\nboth sides and the President of the Board of Trade, the miners asking\r\nfor a continuance of Government subsidy to the industry as long as\r\nthe then existing depression of trade lasted, but this the Government\r\nrefused. The owners had previously issued notices terminating contracts\r\nof employment on March 31, and indicating the new terms upon which men\r\nwould be re-engaged. Practically all the men ceased work in accordance\r\nwith this notice, and refused to resume on the new terms. A stoppage\r\nof work took place from April 1 to July 4, 1921. On June 25, terms of\r\nsettlement were arranged between the Mining Association and the Miners’\r\nFederation which were accepted by the votes of a large majority of miners\r\non July 1. This agreement (_Parliamentary Paper_, 1921, Cmd. 1387) was of\r\na remarkable and far-reaching character. By it the miners dropped their\r\nclaim for a national pool; provision was made for the constitution of\r\na National Board, consisting of equal numbers of persons chosen by the\r\nMining Association and by the Miners’ Federation, and of District Boards\r\nconsisting in equal numbers of persons representing owners and workmen in\r\neach district—each Board having an independent Chairman. It was provided\r\nthat (1) the proceeds in each district of the mining industry should be\r\ndetermined by independent accountants appointed by each side to check by\r\njoint test audit, the owners’ books; (2) standard wages for each district\r\nshould be fixed on the basis of the district basis rates of March 31,\r\n1921, plus district percentages of July 1914, plus percentage additions\r\nfor piece-workers made on the reduction of hours from eight to seven;\r\n(3) minimum wages should be standard wages plus 20 per cent.; (4) for\r\neach district the total should periodically be ascertained for certain\r\ntest periods of the standard wages, the cost of production other than\r\nwages, and standard profits at the rate of 17 per cent. of the standard\r\nwages. This aggregate should then be deducted from the amount of the\r\ndistrict proceeds for those periods, and 83 per cent. of the surplus\r\nshould be applied for payment in the district of an increase of wage\r\nabove the minimum rates. But 83 per cent. might not be, and indeed in\r\nsome districts has not been, enough to bring standard wages up to minimum\r\nwages. As against this contingency Parliament voted, on July 1, 1921, a\r\nsubsidy which was not to exceed £10,000,000 to be used to prevent the\r\nreduction of adult wages in any district exceeding 2_s._ per shift during\r\nJuly, 2_s._ 6_d._ during August, and 3_s._ during September. £7,000,000\r\nwas actually expended under this arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Failure of Part II of the Act of 1920\r\n\r\nDifficulties have arisen in connection with the working of Part II of\r\nthe Mining Industry Act, 1920, relating to the appointment of Pit and\r\nDistrict Committees and Area and National Boards on which owners and\r\nworkers were to be represented. Section 10 provided that Area Boards\r\nshould formulate wages schemes, having regard among other considerations\r\nto profits of the industry within the area. On the introduction of\r\nthe Bill for the Act of 1920, the Miners’ Federation announced their\r\nintention not to assist in working the Act in view of their objection to\r\nthe settlement of wages on any other than a national basis. Having agreed\r\nto a district wages basis in the agreement of July 1921, they decided,\r\nin August 1921, to co-operate with the Mines Department in working\r\nPart II of the Act. Meanwhile, the owners who originally acquiesced\r\nin the terms of the Act, and through spokesmen in Parliament agreed\r\nto work it, similarly changed their minds, and the Mining Association\r\nannounced about the same time that, as the Agreement of July 1921, had\r\nin their view achieved the objects aimed at in Part II of the Act, the\r\nre-imposition of any measure of Government control over wages and allied\r\nquestions would be contrary to the best interests of the industry itself\r\nand of the community, and through the administration of Part II of the\r\nMining Industry Act would add unnecessarily to the burden of taxation.\r\nThe correspondence between the Mines Department and the Association is\r\nprinted in _Parliamentary Papers_, 1921, Cmd. 1551, and 1922, Cmd. 1583,\r\nand deserves consideration. In view of the attitude of the owners, the\r\nSecretary for Mines made a report to Parliament as required by Section 17\r\nof the Act, and as within thirty days from February 7 no resolution to\r\nthe contrary was passed by Parliament, Part II of the Act has ceased to\r\nhave effect. The statutory right on the part of the workers to a voice in\r\nthe ordering of the coal-mining industry is therefore at an end, and the\r\nposition is governed by the Agreement of July 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoyalties\r\n\r\nReference is necessary to the State acquisition of royalties, on which\r\nthere was unanimity amongst the members of the Sankey Commission. One of\r\nthe principal reasons advanced why the State ought to own the coal was\r\nthat no unreasonable obstacle should be placed in the way of mining coal,\r\nand that due attention should be directed to conserving our principal\r\nnational asset, which is also a wasting asset. The Government accepted\r\nthe recommendation, but in the present financial condition of the country\r\nit is obviously impracticable to give effect to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary of Government Policy\r\n\r\nBriefly summarized, the Government’s Labour policy in connection with the\r\ncoal-mining industry is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The industry must be worked by private enterprise.\r\n\r\n2. The functions of the Government in connection with mining should be\r\ncentralized in a Mines Department.\r\n\r\n3. Such assistance as a Government Department can render in (_a_) the\r\ncollection and publication of information; (_b_) removing obstacles to\r\nproduction; (_c_) the formulation of drainage schemes; (_d_) preventing\r\nwasteful working of a great national asset; (_e_) ensuring the safety and\r\nhealth of the workers, and (_f_) assisting, when asked to do so, in the\r\nsettlement of disputes, should be rendered through the Mines Department.\r\n\r\n4. Providing the means (through the Miners’ Welfare Fund) for improving\r\nthe amenities of mining centres.\r\n\r\n5. Encouraging research into the particular problems affecting the health\r\nand safety of workers in the industry.\r\n\r\nThe Mines Department, established under the Act of 1920, is responsible\r\nfor dealing with one of our most important industrial problems, and\r\nthe success of its administration up to the present time is full of\r\nencouragement for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT LABOUR POLICY FOR RAILWAYS\r\n\r\n    Pre-war Conditions—Government War-time Control—The Wage\r\n    Agreement of March 1919—The Railway Strike of September\r\n    1919—The Wage Agreement of March 1920—The Railways Act,\r\n    1921—The Railway Conciliation Machinery of 1921—Sectional\r\n    Railway Councils—Railway Councils.\r\n\r\n\r\nPre-war Conditions\r\n\r\nAs Labour proposes on the first opportunity to nationalize the railways,\r\nthe relationship between the men and the companies is important. Under\r\nan Agreement of November 6, 1907, Conciliation Boards consisting of\r\nrepresentatives of the companies and the men engaged in the manipulation\r\nof traffic had been appointed to deal with questions of hours and wages\r\nand working conditions. A railway strike occurred in 1911, and it was\r\nstated that one of the reasons for the strike was the dissatisfaction of\r\nthe railway men with the working of the Railway Conciliation Scheme. The\r\nGovernment then appointed a Royal Commission to investigate the working\r\nof the scheme and to report what changes, if any, were desirable, with a\r\nview to a prompt and satisfactory settlement of differences. The Royal\r\nCommission reported in October 1911, and suggested a new scheme which,\r\nwith some alterations agreed between the representatives of the companies\r\nand of the Unions, was adopted in December 1911. This scheme the Unions\r\ngave notice, in December 1913, to terminate at the end of November 1914,\r\nat which date they expressed their intention of advancing a national\r\nprogramme for increased wages and a 48-hour week.\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment War-time Control\r\n\r\nOn August 4, 1914, under an Order in Council made in pursuance of\r\nthe Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871, the Secretary of State for\r\nWar issued a warrant—which he renewed week by week, until August\r\n1919, when statutory possession vested in the Minister of Transport\r\nunder the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919, rendered its continuance\r\nunnecessary—authorizing the Board of Trade to take possession of\r\npractically all the railways of the country. This was done, but the\r\nrailways continued to be conducted by their respective managements\r\nacting under the instructions of the Railway Executive Committee. On\r\nOctober 1, 1914, a truce agreement was concluded between the companies\r\nand the Unions, continuing the 1911 Conciliation Scheme, but making it\r\nterminable on six weeks’ notice. Alike with other trades the railwaymen\r\nreceived increases in wages from February 1915, on to November 1918.\r\nUp to September 1918, men of eighteen years and over received a\r\nwar-wage advance of 30_s._ per week. In November 1918, a sliding scale\r\nwas arranged under which the war-wage was to rise and fall with the\r\nindex-number of retail prices as published in the _Labour Gazette_. An\r\nadditional 3_s._, raising the war-wage to 33_s._ per week, was given in\r\nNovember 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wage Agreement of March 1919\r\n\r\nFollowing the Armistice, the National Union of Railwaymen gave notice\r\nto terminate the truce agreement of October 1914, but early in December\r\n1918, the principle of an 8-hour day[13] was conceded by the Government\r\nfor all members of the wages staff as from February 1, 1919. In March\r\n1919, an agreement was made between the Government, the Railway Executive\r\nCommittee and the Unions which provided for increased rates for overtime,\r\nnight-duty and Sunday-work, but provided for stabilizing other wages till\r\nDecember 31, 1919. An important provision was contained in it providing\r\nfor a continuance of negotiations to standardize rates so that all men\r\nthroughout the country doing the same work under the same conditions\r\nshould receive the same rate of wages. This agreement also provided for\r\nthe setting up of a joint committee consisting of representatives of the\r\nRailway Executive Committee and the two Unions concerned[14] to deal\r\nwith questions of pay and conditions until “some final arrangement is\r\narrived at in regard to the future position of railways.” The agreement\r\nstipulated that “when the new Ministry of Ways and Communications is set\r\nup it is the intention of the Government to provide in the organization\r\nfor, and avail itself fully of, the advantage of assistance, co-operation\r\nand advice from the workers in the transportation industry.” Standard\r\nrates were agreed between the Government and the two Unions for drivers,\r\nfiremen and cleaners by an agreement in August 1919, and negotiations\r\nwere continued to standardize the rates for other railwaymen.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Railway Strike of September 1919\r\n\r\nThe Government’s proposals for standardization were rejected by the\r\nUnions, who precipitated a strike, on September 26, 1919, on the railways\r\nthroughout Great Britain. Terms of settlement were signed, on October\r\n5, 1919, providing for standardization at the then existing level of\r\nwages up to September 30, 1920, and providing that no adult railwaymen\r\nin Great Britain should receive less than 51_s._ per week so long as the\r\ncost of living was not less than 110 per cent. above pre-war level. Work\r\nwas resumed on October 6. Subsequently an agreement was made between the\r\nGovernment and the two Unions that, apart from the wage negotiations then\r\nin progress, questions of wages and conditions of service should, during\r\nthe remainder of the period of control under the Ministry of Transport\r\nAct, be dealt with by a Central Board consisting of five railway\r\nrepresentatives and five representatives of the two Unions. Failing\r\nagreement by the Central Board, disputes should be referred to a National\r\nWages Board consisting of four railway managers, four railway workers\r\nor their representatives, and four users of railways, one nominated by\r\nthe Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, one by the\r\nCo-operative Union, one by the Federation of British Industries, and one\r\nby the Associated Chambers of Commerce, with an independent chairman\r\nappointed by the Government. The agreement also provided for Local\r\nCommittees, to which matters of local importance would be referred. The\r\nRailway Executive Committee became unnecessary in view of the Ministry of\r\nTransport Act, 1919, and a new Advisory Committee was set up, consisting\r\nof twelve general managers and four representatives of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wage Agreement of March 1920\r\n\r\nAs a result of the negotiations, an agreement was completed on March\r\n20, 1920,[15] providing for standardization of rates of pay, for wages\r\nto rise and fall according to cost of living, and for a standard rate\r\nbelow which wages should not fall. This is one of the most important\r\nindustrial agreements. The principle of the arrangement was as follows.\r\nThere were many classes of men on different railways graded by different\r\nnames and receiving different rates of pay although doing substantially\r\nthe same work. These various classes were reduced into a small number of\r\nspecified grades. Further, in regard to certain grades, the country was\r\ndivided up into sections, for example: (1) London area; (2) provincial,\r\nindustrial and mining areas and large towns, and (3) rural districts.\r\nThen, on a system of averages, the mean pre-war weekly rate of pay of the\r\nmen of a particular grade on all the railways in a particular section\r\nof the country was ascertained; to that a sum of 38_s._ as war-wage was\r\nadded. This combined sum was to form, as from January 1, 1920, the wage\r\nto be paid as long as the cost of living remained at 125 per cent. above\r\npre-war cost of living. For every five points rise or fall in the cost\r\nof living there was to be an increase or reduction of 1_s._ per week.\r\nStandard or minimum rates were fixed representing generally 100 per cent.\r\nincrease on the average pre-war rates of the respective grades. These\r\nwere rates below which wages would not fall, however much the cost of\r\nliving might go down. This agreement provided on a more fully developed\r\nbasis for a Central Wages Board of ten members, five representing railway\r\nadministration and five the Unions, and for an appellate or National\r\nWages Board of twelve members, four representing the railway companies,\r\nfour the Unions and four the users of the railways, with an independent\r\nChairman appointed by the Government. In promulgating the settlement the\r\nGovernment made this announcement: “In dealing with questions of wages\r\nit has been kept clearly in view by the Government that some addition\r\nto railway wages was due before the war, and that the claims of the\r\nrailwaymen to a higher standard of remuneration were only then postponed\r\nbecause of the country’s necessities.” After this agreement certain\r\nclaims for improvements in pay and working conditions were submitted by\r\nthe Unions to the Central Wages Board, and, on the latter’s failing to\r\nagree, referred to the National Wages Board. The Board by a majority\r\nagreed that certain advances of wages should be given, but they said they\r\ncould not be justified on the ground of increase in the cost of living as\r\nthat was provided for by an automatic advance under the sliding scale.\r\nThe Government agreed to the advances being given.\r\n\r\nThe wages, therefore, of railwaymen in the conciliation grades consist of\r\ncertain rates agreed upon in March 1920, which represented the average\r\npre-war weekly rate of pay of the men in any grade or group of grades,\r\nplus 38_s._ per week, together with further increases ranging from\r\n2_s._ to 7_s._ 6_d._ per week, or 2_s._ to 8_s._ 6_d._ in the case of\r\nsignalmen, granted in June 1920, by the National Wages Board, the whole\r\nbeing subject to variations under the sliding scale, whereby there is a\r\nreduction or increase of 1_s._ per week for every fall or rise of five\r\npoints in the cost of living as shown in the figures published by the\r\nMinistry of Labour. Adjustments in the bonus due under the sliding scale\r\nare considered by the Central Wages Board. A difference arose in regard\r\nto the operation of the sliding scale, and a _modus operandi_ was agreed\r\non by the Central Wages Board which is described in the _Labour Gazette_\r\nof April 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Railways Act, 1921\r\n\r\nOn August 19, 1921, the Railways Act, 1921, was passed, and Section 62\r\nprovided that, as from the date when the railways ceased to be in the\r\npossession of the Minister of Transport—which was August 15, 1921—and\r\nuntil otherwise determined by twelve months’ notice, such notices not\r\nto be given before January 1, 1923, all questions of wages, hours and\r\nconditions of railway servants should, in default of agreement between\r\na company and the Unions, be referred to the Central Wages Board, or on\r\nappeal to the National Wages Board. The Act reconstituted both Boards,\r\nand provided that the Central Wages Board should consist of eight\r\nrepresentatives of railway companies and eight representatives of the\r\nrailway employees—four appointed by the National Union of Railwaymen,\r\ntwo by the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, and\r\ntwo by the Railway Clerks’ Association. The National Wages Board was\r\nprovided to consist of six representatives of the railway way companies,\r\nsix representatives of the railway employees—two appointed by the\r\nNational Union of Railwaymen—two by the Associated Society of Locomotive\r\nEngineers and Firemen, and two by the Railway Clerks’ Association—and\r\nfour representatives of the users of railways—one appointed by the\r\nParliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress,[16] one by the\r\nCo-operative Union, one by the Associated Chambers of Commerce, and one\r\nby the Federation of British Industries, with an independent Chairman\r\nnominated by the Minister of Labour. The Minister has nominated Sir Wm.\r\nMackenzie, K.B.E., K.C.—the President of the Industrial Court.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Railway Conciliation Machinery of 1921\r\n\r\nThe Act further provided that councils on the lines of the Whitley\r\nCouncils should be established for each railway company on the general\r\nbasis of schemes to be prepared by a committee consisting of six\r\nrepresentatives of the General Managers’ Committee of the Railway\r\nClearing House and six representatives of the National Union of\r\nRailwaymen, the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen,\r\nand the Railway Clerks’ Association. These schemes, which have now been\r\nprepared, provide for: (1) local consultation; (2) local departmental\r\ncommittees; (3) Sectional Railway Councils, and (4) Railway Councils. At\r\nstations or depôts with a number of employees in a department or group\r\nof grades less than seventy-five, such employees are to be entitled to\r\nappoint representatives to discuss local matters with the Company’s local\r\nofficials. At stations or depôts where the number exceeds seventy-five,\r\na committee is to be set up, consisting of not more than four elected\r\nrepresentatives of the employees in the department or group of grades\r\nconcerned, and not more than four representatives of the company. The\r\nobjects of the local committee are to provide a recognized means of\r\ncommunication between the employees and the local officials, and to give\r\nthe employees a wider interest in the conditions under which their work\r\nis performed. A local committee is to discuss: (_a_) suggestions for the\r\nsatisfactory arrangement of working hours, breaks, time-recording, etc.;\r\n(_b_) questions of physical welfare; (_c_) holiday arrangements; (_d_)\r\npublicity in regard to rules; (_e_) suggestions as to improvements in\r\norganization of work, labour-saving appliances and other matters; (_f_)\r\ninvestigation of circumstances tending to reduce efficiency, and (_g_)\r\nthe correct loading of traffic to ensure safe transit and the reduction\r\nof claims. Before a matter is discussed by a local committee it must\r\nfirst be submitted by the employees to the officials of the company in\r\nthe ordinary manner, but, failing a satisfactory reply within fourteen\r\ndays, it may be reported to the secretary of the employees’ side of the\r\ncommittee. The company in the same way must exhaust the constitutional\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\n\r\nSectional Railway Councils\r\n\r\nSectional Railway Councils will consist of not more than twelve elected\r\nrepresentatives of the employees, and not more than twelve appointed\r\nrepresentatives of the company, and not more than five Sectional\r\nCouncils are to be established on any railway. Each side will have its\r\nown secretary, who will have the right to take part in the proceedings.\r\nIf one takes a railway on which the whole staff of the company is\r\ndivided into the usual five sections, viz., (1) clerks, station-masters,\r\nsupervisors, etc.; (2) locomotive men; (3) traffic department men;\r\n(4) goods and cartage staff, and (5) permanent way department men,\r\nplatelayers, etc., each section will elect representatives to the\r\nSectional Council, and the number of representatives of each section\r\nwill be according to the proportion of the employees in the groups of\r\nthe grades in the section. In addition, the number of representatives\r\nelected to each group of grades will be distributed as nearly as possible\r\nby districts. Sectional Councils will deal with: (_a_) local application\r\nof national agreements relating to standard salaries, wages, hours of\r\nduty and conditions of service other than subjects submitted directly to\r\nthe Central Wages Board by railway companies or the Trade Unions; (_b_)\r\nsuggestions as to operating, working and kindred matters; (_c_) other\r\nmatters in which the company and the employees are mutually interested,\r\nsuch as co-operation with a view to securing increased business, greater\r\nefficiency and economy, the well-being of the staff, recruitment and\r\ntenure of service, etc.; (_d_) subjects remitted by the Railway Council\r\nto a Sectional Council.\r\n\r\n\r\nRailway Councils\r\n\r\nFor each railway a Railway Council is to be appointed consisting of not\r\nmore than ten representatives of the company and ten representatives of\r\nthe employees. The representatives of the employees will consist of two\r\nmembers of each Sectional Council; each side will have a secretary with\r\npower to take part in the proceedings. The Railway Council will deal with\r\nall matters with which a Sectional Council can deal, and which are of\r\ncommon interest to two or more sections, but it can deal with no matter\r\nbefore a Sectional Council has had an opportunity of considering it. If\r\na Sectional Council is unable to agree on any matter, the employees’\r\nside may refer it to the Trade Unions concerned, or the Council may, by\r\nagreement, refer it to the Railway Council. If a Sectional or a Railway\r\nCouncil cannot agree on any question of the local application of national\r\nagreements in regard to rates of pay and conditions of service, the\r\nmatter of difference may be submitted by the employees’ side to the\r\nTrade Unions concerned, who take it up with the Company, and, failing\r\nagreement, may refer it to the Central Wages Board. Before employees can\r\nsubmit any question to a Sectional or Railway Council they must first\r\nsubmit it to the company to consider in the ordinary way, but, failing a\r\nsatisfactory answer within twenty-one days, the facts may be reported to\r\nthe employees’ secretary of the Council concerned, and the company itself\r\nmust proceed in the same way. The working of the Railway Councils and\r\nCommittees will be followed with the greatest interest by all concerned\r\nin the development of industrial conciliation machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT LABOUR POLICY FOR AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\n    Government War-time Control—Government’s New Policy in 1921—The\r\n    Establishment of Joint Conciliation Committees in England and\r\n    Wales—The Work of the Conciliation Committees—Agriculture and\r\n    Unemployment Insurance.\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment War-time Control\r\n\r\nThe necessity during the war of encouraging the production of food at\r\nhome led to the Corn Production Act, 1917, which provided for control\r\nby the Ministry of Agriculture of cultivation, the constitution of an\r\nAgricultural Wages Board to fix minimum rates of wages for persons\r\nemployed in agriculture, and for guaranteed minimum prices for wheat and\r\noats. Minimum rates were fixed, and from time to time varied. Although\r\nthe Board did not wipe out wholly the pre-war county agricultural\r\nwage-differentials, they very largely reduced them—the final percentage\r\nof increase varying from about 110 per cent. to 230 per cent. over\r\npre-war. After the Armistice, the Government wisely realized it would\r\nbe a mistaken policy to try and continue to fix minimum prices for oats\r\nand wheat, or to control cultivation and regulate wages. When wholesale\r\nprices broke in 1921, and the community became unable to pay the minimum\r\nprices, the Government decided it would be unsound finance to maintain\r\nprices and wages out of a national subsidy. In war-time it may be right\r\nto compel farmers to grow wheat and oats because of the country’s\r\nneeds—it is wholly wrong to do so in peace-time—the right policy is to\r\nleave them to cultivate their land as they, in their own interests, think\r\nfit.\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment’s New Policy in 1921\r\n\r\nThe Corn Production Acts (Repeal) Act, 1921, was thereupon passed.\r\nThat Act abolished minimum prices and wages, created a special fund\r\nof £1,000,000 for agricultural development, and provided that the\r\nMinister of Agriculture as respects England and Wales, and the Board of\r\nAgriculture for Scotland as respects Scotland, should be empowered to\r\ntake steps to secure the voluntary formation of local Joint Conciliation\r\nCommittees, representative of persons (whether owners or occupiers of\r\nagricultural land) employing persons in agriculture, and of agricultural\r\nworkpeople, for the purpose of dealing with rates of wages, hours of\r\nwork and conditions of employment. The Act provides that a rate of wages\r\nagreed upon by a Joint Conciliation Committee, and on the Committee’s\r\napplication, confirmed by the Minister and duly advertised, becomes the\r\nwage legally payable in the area, unless the Committee certifies that\r\nunder the special circumstances of a particular case it is satisfied that\r\na contract for a lower rate is fair and reasonable, or, in the event of\r\nthe Committee refusing so to certify, the Court in which proceedings\r\nare taken for the recovery of the rate agreed by the Committee is so\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Establishment of Joint Conciliation Committees in England and Wales\r\n\r\nAs the Ministry of Agriculture’s function is confined to moral suasion,\r\nthe task of getting these Committees established is a difficult one, and\r\nthe Ministry is to be congratulated on the progress it has made. Many\r\nfarmers are still incensed at the repeal of the Corn Production Act, and\r\nthe resulting loss to them of a substantial subsidy on wheat and oats,\r\nand are inclined to resent any action by the Ministry. The leaders of\r\nthe workers are equally incensed at the abolition of the Agricultural\r\nWages Board with its compulsory powers, and demand its re-establishment.\r\nThe scheme of Conciliation Committees, moreover, was launched at an\r\nunpropitious time. Prices were falling rapidly, and farmers, after having\r\ncultivated their crops throughout the year on the basis of a fairly high\r\ncost of production with wages at a high level, found themselves compelled\r\nto sell their produce at prices less, in many cases, than half those\r\nof the previous year. In consequence they pressed for substantial and\r\nimmediate wage reductions. From the workers’ point of view the autumn\r\nof 1921 was equally inopportune for initiating a new system of settling\r\nwages, as, owing to the favourable summer, work on the farm was well\r\nadvanced and farmers were in a position to reduce their staffs. In\r\naddition, the growing amount of unemployment materially weakened the\r\nworkers’ bargaining power.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Work of the Conciliation Committees\r\n\r\nThe greatest tact and discretion was, therefore, necessary to avoid\r\nany appearance of undue interference by the Ministry, and at the same\r\ntime powerful persuasion had to be exercised to induce both sides\r\nto come to an agreement. The officers of the Ministry (assisted by\r\nofficers appointed for the purpose by the Minister of Labour) have,\r\nnotwithstanding all these difficulties, succeeded with signal ability in\r\nembedding already the roots of the scheme deep down into the agricultural\r\nindustry. In the short time which has elapsed since the passing of the\r\nAct of 1921, 61 Committees have been established, covering the whole of\r\nthe country, and of these, 54 have made agreements, though in some cases\r\nthey have only been for short periods. In the remaining 7 areas, although\r\nefforts to agree have been made, no agreement has yet been reached.\r\n\r\nThe rate of wages which is now being paid generally for male agricultural\r\nworkers is about 30_s._ to 32_s._ for 48-50 hours, and many Conciliation\r\nCommittees have agreed on these rates. In the north of England the rates\r\nare usually somewhat higher, while in East Anglia and in several counties\r\nwhere no agreements have been reached the employers refuse to offer more\r\nthan 30_s._, a rate which the workers equally refuse to accept. These\r\nrates compare with the Wages Board rate of 46_s._ for 48-50 hours, which\r\nwas in force up to the beginning of September 1921. The Wages Board at\r\ntheir last meeting reduced this rate to 42_s._, which was the rate in\r\nforce when the Conciliation Committees came into being. There was a fall\r\nin October 1921, to 36_s._ per week, followed by a gradual diminution\r\nto the rates mentioned above. Long period agreements running up to\r\nthe beginning of October 1922, were successfully concluded in several\r\ncounties with the assistance of representatives of the Ministry of\r\nAgriculture, at 32_s._ for 48 hours up to the beginning of March 1922,\r\nand 31_s._ for 50 hours over the remainder of the period. These long\r\nterm agreements are a hopeful feature. The farmer gets a settled rate of\r\nwage when farm operations are in full swing, including both hay and corn\r\nharvest; the labourer gets a certain minimum wage, under which he will\r\nbenefit by further falls in the cost of living during the currency of the\r\nagreement. At the same time, the rates now operative make full allowance\r\nfor the changes to date in the cost of living. Taking the pre-war average\r\ncash wages at 16_s._ 9_d._ per week, the comparative figure based on\r\nthe cost of living index number for June 1, 1922, of 80 per cent. over\r\nJuly 1914, would be 32_s._ 2_d._, and it is probably true to say that\r\nthe agricultural labourer has experienced, since October 1921, a greater\r\nreduction in wages than most other trades. From the farmers’ point of\r\nview, however, the fall in wages is more than justified by the drop in\r\nprices, which has been appreciably more rapid than the fall in the cost\r\nof living.\r\n\r\nOne most encouraging circumstance is the extent to which concluded\r\nagreements are faithfully observed by the farmers. The Committees have no\r\ndirect power to enforce their decisions; they may send their agreements\r\nto the Minister of Agriculture for confirmation and then under the Act\r\npayment of the agreed rates becomes recoverable at law. As yet five\r\nCommittees only have asked for confirmation of their agreements. On the\r\nwhole, employers are opposed to confirmation, and the workers do not\r\ndemand it. Although the agreements are in the main observed by employers,\r\nthe workers’ representatives complain that this is not so in every case.\r\nIf there were any serious tendency towards non-observance the employers\r\non the Conciliation Committees would agree to submission of agreements\r\nfor confirmation; they would not allow some employers to evade payment\r\nof the agreed rates while others paid. The absence of any such general\r\ndemand indicates that, substantially, the agreed wages are being paid.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgriculture and Unemployment Insurance\r\n\r\nThe Labour Party makes the singularly disingenuous complaint that the\r\nGovernment does not apply the National Unemployment Insurance Scheme\r\nto persons engaged in agriculture. The true facts are that on December\r\n2, 1920, the Agricultural Wages Board appointed a Committee, under the\r\nchairmanship of Sir Henry Rew, K.C.B., comprising representatives of\r\nemployers and also representatives of unions whose members were engaged\r\nin agriculture, to report upon the extent to which the Unemployment\r\nInsurance Acts could practicably, and with benefit, be applied to\r\nagricultural workers. The Report of the Committee (_Parliamentary Paper_,\r\n1921, Cmd. 1344) was unanimous, and to the effect that there was general\r\nopposition both by employers and workers to the inclusion of agriculture\r\nunder the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme. One of the\r\nworkers’ representatives, a signatory to this finding, appended a note\r\nto say that he believed in some districts there was an undoubted desire\r\nof the agricultural workers to be included under the Act—notwithstanding\r\nthat, neither his finding nor that of the other workers’ representatives\r\nrecommended the extension of the Unemployment Insurance Acts to\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nNo one who is aware of the difficulties, especially in the agricultural\r\nindustry, of successfully introducing methods of collective bargaining,\r\ncould fail to appreciate the soundness of the policy of Joint\r\nConciliation Committees, or fail to rejoice at the steady progress which\r\nthe Ministry of Agriculture is making.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT POLICY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT\r\n\r\n    1. State Unemployment Insurance—The Present Scheme\r\n    of 1920—Emergency Provisions—Temporary Act of March,\r\n    1921—Temporary Act of July, 1921—Temporary Provision for\r\n    Dependents’ Act of November, 1921—Temporary Act of April,\r\n    1922—The Efficiency of the State Scheme.\r\n\r\n    2. Construction of Works of Public Utility—Unemployment Grants\r\n    Committee—The Scheme of 1920—The Extended Scheme of 1921.\r\n\r\n    3. Expedited Road Schemes—The 1920-21 Programme—The 1921-22\r\n    Programme—The Special Metropolitan Schemes—The Provincial\r\n    Schemes—Conditions Attaching to Grants.\r\n\r\n    4. Poor Law Relief—Principles Governing Administration of\r\n    Relief—Ascertainment of Applicant’s Income—Assistance to\r\n    Guardians to Carry out Works—Funding of Cost of Relief—Help to\r\n    Poorer Metropolitan Unions—Assistance to Guardians to Raise\r\n    Loans.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnemployment is to-day a burning question; it will always be in industry\r\nan outstanding difficulty. The main lines of Government policy are,\r\ntherefore, important; they are of comparatively recent date. From 1890,\r\nand indeed before, Metropolitan borough councils and their predecessors,\r\nthe vestries, and the principal provincial local authorities had been in\r\nthe habit of providing relief works every winter for the unemployed, each\r\non its own method and without investigating the necessitous circumstances\r\nof applicants for work. Local Labour bureaux—really Labour Exchanges—had\r\nbeen established in London by some vestries and metropolitan borough\r\ncouncils without statutory authority. Their establishment was formally\r\nauthorized by the Labour Bureaux (London) Act, 1902. In 1905 Lord (then\r\nthe Right Hon. Walter) Long, when President of the Local Government\r\nBoard, inaugurated a voluntary scheme consisting of central and district\r\ncommittees in London to collect funds and provide work to deal with\r\ndistress arising from unemployment. The practical operation of this\r\nscheme was deemed sufficiently successful to warrant the passing of the\r\nUnemployed Workmen’s Act, 1905, which provided for establishment, by\r\norder of the Local Government Board, of a statutory Central Unemployed\r\nBody and metropolitan Distress Committees in London, and outside London,\r\nof Distress Committees with central and local powers in each municipal\r\nborough or urban district with a population of not less than 50,000,\r\nand for the rest of a county, of Central and Local Committees. Then, as\r\nhas been described, the State Labour Exchanges were authorized in 1909.\r\nTheir establishment was the first attempt of Government to deal with\r\nunemployment on a considered policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. STATE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE\r\n\r\nThe next deliberate step was the scheme of State insurance against\r\nunemployment instituted by Part II of the National Insurance Act,\r\n1911. It applied compulsorily to about 2½ million workmen in building,\r\nshipbuilding, engineering, construction of works and vehicles,\r\niron-founding, and, to an extent, saw-milling, but not to non-manual\r\nworkers. The contribution per week was: employers, 2½_d._; workmen,\r\n2½_d._; State, 1⅔_d._, the State contribution being thus one-fourth of\r\nthe whole. The benefit assured was 7_s._ per week for fifteen weeks, but\r\nnothing during the first week of unemployment, and, when payable, only\r\nat the rate of one week’s benefit for every five contributions paid. In\r\n1916, the National Insurance (Part II Amendment) Act, 1914, brought in\r\nunder the scheme a further 1¼ million workpeople employed in certain\r\ntrades, principally metals and chemicals, and engaged in the manufacture\r\nof munitions of war. At the Armistice, the scheme therefore only covered\r\nsome 3¾ million persons. This provision was wholly inadequate to meet\r\nthe unemployment which ensued. A scheme of free out-of-work donation\r\nwas instituted by the Government for both civilian workers and for men\r\nand women discharged from the Forces. This scheme remained in operation\r\nfrom November 1918, until November 1919, for civilians, and until March\r\n1921, for ex-members of the Forces, and, in a few special cases, somewhat\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Present Scheme of 1920\r\n\r\nIt was plainly necessary to make further provision, so a Bill for\r\nthe extension of unemployment insurance was introduced in the House\r\nof Commons, first in December 1919, and again in February 1920, and\r\npassing into law in August as the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, came\r\ninto operation on November 8, 1920. It is the statute under which the\r\npermanent National Unemployment Insurance Scheme is regulated—by it all\r\nprevious enactments relating to unemployment insurance are repealed. This\r\nAct brings into insurance practically the whole industrial population,\r\nand also non-manual workers whose remuneration does not exceed £250 per\r\nannum. It excludes, however, agriculture and private domestic service,\r\nand empowers the Minister of Labour to grant certificates exempting the\r\npermanent employees of certain public undertakings, but, save in the\r\ncase of railway servants, the numbers engaged in such specially excepted\r\nemployments are not large. The total number of workpeople insured as the\r\nresult of this Act is about twelve millions. The contributions prescribed\r\nby the Act of 1920 (since temporarily increased) are as follows:\r\n\r\n    -----------------------------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n                                 |Employer’s |Employee’s |    State\r\n                                 | Share.    | Share.    |Contribution.\r\n    -----------------------------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n    Men                          | 4_d._     | 4_d._     |  2_d._\r\n    Women                        | 3½_d._    | 3_d._     |  1⅔_d._\r\n    Boys  (over 16 and under 18) | 2_d._     | 2_d._     |  1⅓_d._\r\n    Girls (over 16 and under 18) | 2_d._     | 1½_d._    |  1_d._\r\n    -----------------------------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n\r\nThe scheme is mainly worked through the Employment Exchanges. An\r\nunemployment book is issued to every insured worker, and, on obtaining\r\nemployment, he is required to lodge it with his employer, who keeps\r\nit while the employment lasts, and when paying wages must affix to it\r\na stamp of the value of the combined contributions of himself and the\r\nworker.\r\n\r\nThe books are valid for twelve months, from the beginning of July in one\r\nyear to the beginning of July in the following year—a period known as the\r\n“Insurance Year.” Every July the books are exchanged. Employers usually\r\nlodge the books of their workers in bulk at the Employment Exchanges,\r\nwhere fresh books are written up for the ensuing year, but a workman has\r\nthe right to take his old book himself to the Exchange and obtain his new\r\nbook for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nWorkmen are also entitled to receive from the Department, on application,\r\na statement showing the condition of their accounts.\r\n\r\nThe stamps representing contributions are sold at Post Offices, and the\r\nproceeds of sales are paid over weekly by the General Post Office to\r\nthe Ministry of Labour. The remittances are placed to the credit of the\r\nUnemployment Fund established under the Act, and the State contribution\r\nis added to the amounts so received, and similarly credited to the Fund.\r\nWhen the Fund is in credit, i.e. when the revenue is more than sufficient\r\nto pay the benefits accruing due, any surplus moneys are handed over\r\nto the National Debt Commissioners for investment on behalf of the\r\nFund. Owing to employment being exceptionally good immediately before\r\nand during the war, the Fund accumulated a considerable surplus, which\r\namounted, in November 1920, when the Act of that year was passed, to\r\nabout £20,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe benefits prescribed in the Act of 1920, which were afterwards\r\ntemporarily varied, are 15_s._ a week for men and 12_s._ a week for\r\nwomen, with half-rate for boys and girls. Benefit was provided to\r\nbe payable after the first three days of unemployment, afterwards\r\npermanently increased to six by the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2)\r\nAct, 1921, which constitute a “waiting period,” and for a maximum of\r\ntwenty-six weeks in any “insurance year.” It was fifteen weeks in the\r\nAct of 1920, but this was increased to twenty-six by the Unemployment\r\nInsurance Act, 1921. The amount of benefit must not in any event exceed\r\nthe proportion of one week’s benefit for every six contributions paid,\r\ni.e. one day of benefit for each contribution. This limit is in certain\r\ncases temporarily suspended by the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1921.\r\n\r\nThe conditions for the receipt of benefit are that a prescribed number of\r\ncontributions have been paid, viz. a minimum of twelve under the Act of\r\n1920—in certain cases temporarily relaxed by the Unemployment Insurance\r\nAct, 1921; that applications for benefit have been made in the prescribed\r\nmanner; that the contributor proves that since his application he has\r\nbeen continuously unemployed, capable of, and available for, work, but\r\nunable to obtain suitable employment, and that he has not exhausted his\r\nright to benefit. The workman is disqualified[17] from benefit if his\r\nunemployment is caused by a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute\r\nat his place of employment, or if he has lost his employment through\r\nmisconduct or by voluntary resignation without just cause. Nor is benefit\r\npayable while the workman is an inmate of a prison or a workhouse or\r\nany other institution supported out of public funds, nor whilst he is\r\nresident outside the United Kingdom. Should he be in receipt of sickness\r\nor disablement benefit under the Health Insurance Acts or of an old age\r\npension, he can claim no benefit.\r\n\r\nOnce an insured worker becomes unemployed, the employer must return\r\nto him his unemployment book, which he must lodge at the Employment\r\nExchange, where he may claim benefit. When a claim is made, an inquiry\r\nis addressed by the Exchange to the last employer of the workman as\r\nstated by him on the claim form, in order to ascertain whether the\r\nconditions for the receipt of benefit are satisfied, and whether any\r\nof the disqualifications apply. During the currency of his claim, an\r\nunemployed insured worker must attend at the Exchange as evidence that\r\nhe is unemployed. There he signs a declaration during the normal working\r\nhours of his trade that he is unemployed and unable to obtain suitable\r\nemployment. In normal times, the frequency with which unemployed insured\r\nworkers have to attend for this purpose is as follows: If the worker\r\nlives within two miles of the nearest Exchange, he is required to attend\r\ndaily; if he lives between two and four miles from the Exchange, he\r\nattends every other day; between four and six miles, he attends once\r\na week, and furnishes a declaration signed by two persons that he is\r\nunemployed; if he lives more than six miles from the nearest Exchange,\r\nhe is not required to attend there personally for the purpose of giving\r\nevidence of unemployment, but may forward a certificate signed by two\r\npersons as to the continuance of his unemployment. Claims for benefit\r\nare adjudicated upon, in the first instance, by officers appointed under\r\nthe Act known as insurance officers. The manager of the Exchange acts as\r\nan “insurance officer” and authorizes payment of obviously valid claims.\r\nThose as to which doubt arises are sent to the Chief Insurance Officer\r\nin London for adjudication. If the insurance officer’s decision is\r\nunfavourable to the claimant, the latter has a right of appeal to a Court\r\nof Referees, consisting of an independent chairman, a representative of\r\nemployers and a representative of the contributors. The chairman and the\r\npanels are appointed by the Minister of Labour. Either the insurance\r\nofficer, or the Trade Union to which the claimant belongs, or the\r\nclaimant himself, if leave is given to him by the Court, has a further\r\nright of appeal from the recommendation of the Court of Referees to an\r\numpire appointed by the Crown, whose decision is final and conclusive.\r\n\r\nWhile all claims to benefit have, in the first instance, to be made\r\nat an Employment Exchange—where benefit is in general paid—power is\r\ngiven to the Minister under Section 17 of the Act of 1920 to enter\r\ninto arrangements with associations of contributors (practically all\r\nTrade Unions) under which members of such associations may prove their\r\nunemployment and receive their benefit through the machinery of the\r\nassociation. Before such an arrangement can be made, the Minister has\r\nto be satisfied that the rules of the association provide for payment\r\nout of its own funds of unemployment benefit to its members, and that\r\nthe association has in operation a system for obtaining notification of\r\nopportunities of employment and of placing its members in employment.\r\nState benefit paid out by associations under this arrangement is\r\nsubsequently repaid to the association from the Unemployment Fund.\r\nThe associations are further entitled to a grant-in-aid of their\r\nadministrative expenses not exceeding 1_s._ for every week of State\r\nbenefit paid to their members under the arrangement. Shortly before the\r\ndecline in trade, which began in the autumn of 1920, arrangements were\r\ncompleted or were in course of completion under Section 17 with nearly\r\n200 associations having a membership of nearly 4,000,000 persons. Owing,\r\nhowever, to the increase of industrial depression and the consequent\r\nstrain on the financial resources of the associations, a number of\r\nthese arrangements were either terminated or not completed. The number\r\nof arrangements in operation on July 31, 1922, was 145, covering a\r\nmembership of rather more than 1,000,000.\r\n\r\nA new and important provision of the Act of 1920 was the right given to\r\nindustries to contract out of the State scheme and institute special\r\nschemes of compulsory insurance for their own workers. Before a special\r\nscheme can be approved it has to be submitted by a Joint Industrial\r\nCouncil or an association fully representative of the majority of\r\nemployers and employed in the industry. The Minister has to be satisfied\r\nthat insurance against unemployment in the industry can be more\r\nsatisfactorily provided by a special scheme than under the general scheme\r\nof the Act. The special scheme must cover all the employed persons in the\r\nindustry, and the benefits must be not less favourable on the whole than\r\nthe benefits provided by the Act. The industries which might naturally\r\nbe disposed to contract out of the general scheme are those in which\r\nunemployment is less than the average rate of unemployment in all the\r\nindustries included in the general scheme. In other words, only those\r\nindustries might be expected to contract out which could, by reason\r\nof their lower rate of unemployment, provide greater benefits for the\r\nsame rate of contribution as under the general scheme, or the same or\r\na slightly better rate of benefit for a lower contribution. As against\r\nthis, the rate of State contribution payable to a special scheme is\r\nreduced to a sum not exceeding three-tenths of the contribution which\r\nwould otherwise be paid by the State in respect of contributions from\r\nthe industry if the employers and employed persons in the industry\r\nremained in the general scheme. Only one special scheme has, so far,\r\nbeen approved, viz. that for the Insurance business, which covers about\r\n80,000 persons. In view of the temporary emergency provisions made in\r\nthe Unemployment Insurance Act, 1921, and the Unemployment Insurance\r\n(No. 2) Act, 1921, to meet the abnormal amount of unemployment, it became\r\nnecessary to suspend the right of additional industries to contract out\r\nuntil the Unemployment Fund again attains a position of solvency.\r\n\r\nA feature of the State scheme which is open to criticism is the right of\r\ninsured persons to receive a refund in respect of their contributions.\r\nThis provision follows generally the lines of Section 95 of the Act of\r\n1911. The refund made is the excess of the employed person’s share of the\r\ncontributions paid in respect of him, less any benefit he has received.\r\nRefunds are not payable unless the employed person has reached the age of\r\n60 and has paid in the aggregate a specified number of contributions.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Provisions\r\n\r\nOwing to the acute industrial depression, it has been necessary to\r\nadd to the permanent scheme a number of temporary provisions. It was\r\nrealized, when the Act of 1920 was being framed, that special provision\r\nwas required to meet unemployment occurring immediately after the passing\r\nof the Act amongst persons who were being brought into compulsory\r\ninsurance for the first time. Accordingly, Section 44 of the Act of\r\n1920 provided that, for twelve months after the commencement of the\r\nAct, i.e. up to November 8, 1921, eight weeks’ benefit might be drawn\r\nif four contributions had been paid. Between the passing of the Act on\r\nAugust 9, 1920, and its commencement on November 8, 1920, the industrial\r\nsituation materially worsened, and when the Act came into operation\r\nconsiderable numbers of workpeople were unemployed who had not paid even\r\nfour contributions. The Unemployment Insurance (Temporary Provisions\r\nAmendment) Act, 1920, was accordingly passed in December 1920, providing\r\nthat if an unemployed person could show that, although no contributions\r\nhad been paid in respect of him under the Acts, yet he had in fact been\r\nemployed in an insurable occupation in each of ten weeks since December\r\n31, 1919, or of four weeks since July 4, 1920, that would count as\r\nequivalent to payment of four contributions under Section 44 of the Act\r\nof 1920, and eight weeks’ benefit might be paid to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nTemporary Act of March, 1921\r\n\r\nUnemployment continued to grow, and early in 1921 it was apparent\r\nthat many persons, who would normally have paid contributions and so\r\nqualified for benefits under the Act of 1920, were disqualified because,\r\nowing to the exceptional industrial position, they had not been in a\r\nposition to pay contributions. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1921,\r\nwas therefore passed in March, 1921, which came into force immediately,\r\nand made special provision for the payment of unemployment benefit to\r\npersons who were not qualified for benefit by reason of not having paid\r\ncontributions. Under the Act of March, 1921, it was provided that during\r\neach of two special periods, the first from March 3, 1921, to November\r\n2, 1921, the second from November 3, 1921, to July 2, 1922, unemployed\r\npersons might draw up to a maximum of sixteen weeks’ benefit provided\r\nthey showed:\r\n\r\n    (1) That they had been employed in each of not less than twenty\r\n    weeks since December 31, 1919 (ten weeks for ex-members of H.M.\r\n    Forces).\r\n\r\n    (2) That they were normally employed in an insurable occupation.\r\n\r\n    (3) That they were genuinely seeking whole-time employment but\r\n    unable to obtain it.\r\n\r\nThe decision whether applicants for benefit satisfy the special\r\nconditions prescribed by the Act of March, 1921, rests with the Minister,\r\nbut was given the power to refer questions relating to compliance with\r\nthe requirements to the Local Employment Committees. This power has been\r\nfreely exercised, and in practice the recommendations of the Committees\r\nin regard to cases submitted to them for consideration are usually\r\naccepted by the Minister.\r\n\r\nThe Act of March, 1921, increased the rates of benefit to 20_s._ a week\r\nfor men and 16_s._ a week for women, with half-rates for boys and girls.\r\nArrangements were also made for an increase in the rates of contributions\r\nas from the beginning of the next ensuing insurance year, viz. July 4,\r\n1921, but these were again increased by a subsequent Act. Notwithstanding\r\nthe special provision of benefit made by the Act of March, 1921, large\r\nnumbers of persons who remained unemployed and had exhausted their rights\r\nto benefit in July 1921. It was, therefore, decided to introduce fresh\r\nlegislation, making further provision for this class of case.\r\n\r\n\r\nTemporary Act of July, 1921\r\n\r\nThe solvency of the Unemployment Fund had been impaired by the Act\r\nof March, 1921, and at the same time distress from unemployment was\r\nincreasing. The Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Act was, therefore, passed\r\non July 1, 1921, which gave power to the Minister to extend the maximum\r\nperiod of benefit which might be drawn in each of the two special periods\r\nprescribed by the Act of March, 1921, by six weeks, making the maximum\r\nperiod of benefit twenty-two weeks, instead of sixteen. A great number of\r\nsix-week extensions were granted, dating from February 22, 1922, which\r\nexpired on April 5, 1922. At the same time the rates of benefit were\r\ntemporarily reduced to 15_s._ a week for men and 12_s._ a week for women,\r\nwith half-rates for boys and girls as long as the “deficiency period”\r\nlasts, i.e. (Sect. 16) until the Treasury certifies that the Unemployment\r\nFund is solvent; and the waiting period of three days in the Act of 1920\r\nwas permanently raised to a week as under the original Act of 1911. The\r\ncontributions payable from July 4, 1921, were increased under the Act of\r\nJuly, 1921, to the following amounts:\r\n\r\n    -------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n           |Employer’s |Employee’s |   State\r\n           |  Share.   |  Share.   |Contribution.\r\n    -------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n    Men    | 8_d._     | 7_d._     | 3¾_d._\r\n    Women  | 7_d._     | 6_d._     | 3¼_d._\r\n    Boys   | 4_d._     | 3½_d._    | 1⅞_d._\r\n    Girls  | 3½_d._    | 3_d._     | 1⅝_d._\r\n    -------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n\r\nThese rates of contributions were payable until July 1, 1923, or the\r\nexpiration of the deficiency period, whichever is the later, after which\r\nthe rates prescribed in the Act of 1920 were restored.\r\n\r\nIt has to be borne in mind that the provisions made by the Unemployment\r\nInsurance Acts of December, 1920, March, 1921, and July, 1921, are\r\ntemporary only, and not part of the normal State scheme. The Act\r\nof March, 1921, authorizes the Treasury to advance moneys to the\r\nUnemployment Fund up to ten million pounds; this was increased to twenty\r\nmillion pounds by the Act of July, 1921. It has been necessary for the\r\nTreasury to make advances to enable the Fund to pay the benefits: the\r\namount owing by the Fund to the Treasury on December 31, 1921, was\r\napproximately eight million pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTemporary Provision for Dependents’ Act of November, 1921\r\n\r\nAs part of the temporary emergency programme of the Government to\r\nalleviate the abnormal unemployment existing in the autumn of 1921, the\r\nUnemployed Workers’ Dependents (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, was\r\npassed on November 9, which made provision for the payment of allowances\r\nto the wives and dependent children of unemployed workers who were\r\nin receipt of benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Acts. This\r\nprovision, as made by this Act, was for a period of six months only—to\r\nend on May 7, 1922. The Dependents Act provided that persons who were\r\nliable to be insured under the Unemployment Insurance Acts and their\r\nemployers should, for a period of six months from November 7, 1921 (which\r\nperiod might be extended in the event of any deficiency occurring in the\r\nFund) pay additional contributions for the purpose of creating a Fund\r\nseparate and distinct from the Unemployment Fund, out of which allowances\r\nfor dependents would be paid. To the contributions of employer and\r\nemployed, the State made an addition.\r\n\r\n    -------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n           |Employer’s |Employee’s |   State\r\n           |  Share.   |  Share.   |Contribution.\r\n    -------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n    Men    | 2_d._     | 2_d._     | 3_d._\r\n    Women }|           |           |\r\n    Boys  }| 1_d._     | 1_d._     | 2_d._\r\n    Girls }|           |           |\r\n    -------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n\r\nGrants were made at the rate of 5_s._ per week for a wife and 1_s._ a\r\nweek for each dependent child.\r\n\r\n\r\nTemporary Act of April, 1922\r\n\r\nYet still further emergency legislation has been necessary to meet the\r\ncontinuance of unemployment. On March 13, 1922, there were in Great\r\nBritain 1,690,000 insured persons registered as wholly unemployed\r\nand 225,000 as on short-time. Of these, large numbers began to run\r\nout of benefit on April 5, the date at which expired the six weeks’\r\nextension of benefit under the Act of July, 1921, each subsequent week\r\nadding to this number. On July 2, 1922, the whole of the emergency or\r\n“uncovenanted” benefit provided by the Temporary Act of March, 1921,\r\nwould have wholly expired. In addition, on May 9, 1922, the Unemployed\r\nWorkers’ Dependents (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, came to an end.\r\nThe Government accordingly passed the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922,\r\nwhich came into operation on April 6, 1922. The effect of its complicated\r\nprovisions can be shortly summarized. It terminated the second special\r\nperiod under the Act of March, 1921, at April 5, 1922, instead of July 2,\r\n1922, as by that Act provided. It then prescribed a third special period\r\nand a fourth special period, the third from April 6, 1922, to November 1,\r\n1922, the fourth from November 2, 1922, to July 1, 1923. During the third\r\nspecial period, insured persons no longer entitled to benefit under the\r\npermanent insurance scheme will be allowed to receive “uncovenanted”\r\nbenefit for an aggregate of fifteen weeks, increased to twenty-two weeks\r\nby the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1922—passed July 20, 1922. As\r\nthis fifteen weeks’ benefit had to cover thirty calendar weeks, it was\r\ndivided up into three periods of benefit with a gap between each of five\r\nweeks, reduced to one week by the Act of July 20, 1922. During the fourth\r\nspecial period, twelve weeks’ benefit will be paid, with two possible\r\nfurther extensions of five weeks each. The insurance benefit remains,\r\nunder the Act of April, 1922, at the same level as before, namely 15_s._\r\nper week for the men and 12_s._ for the women, with the additional\r\nbenefit provided by the Dependents’ Act of November, 1921, 5_s._ per\r\nweek for the wife, and 1_s._ per week for each child. The rates of\r\ncontributions by employed persons, employers and the State are the totals\r\nof the contributions under the Act of July, 1921, and the Dependents’ Act\r\nof November, 1921, and are, therefore, as follows:\r\n\r\n    ---------------+-------------+-----------+-------------\r\n                   | Employer’s  |Employee’s |   State\r\n                   |   Share.    |  Share.   |Contribution.\r\n    ---------------+-------------+-----------+-------------\r\n    Men            | 10_d._      | 9_d._     | 6¾_d._\r\n    Women          |  8_d._      | 7_d._     | 5¼_d._\r\n    Boys under 18  |  5_d._      | 4½_d._    | 3⅞_d._\r\n    Girls          |  4½_d._     | 4_d._     | 3⅝_d._\r\n    ---------------+-------------+-----------+-------------\r\n\r\nThese will be the contributions until the end of the deficiency period as\r\ndefined in Section 16 of the Act of July, 1921.\r\n\r\nFrom June 1921, to March 1922, the Unemployment Insurance Scheme was\r\ncontinuously carrying an average of 1¾ million persons, and 53½ million\r\npounds of benefit were distributed; the Government’s estimate is 1½\r\nmillion persons wholly unemployed from April 1922, to June 1923. These\r\nfigures will involve the payment of sixty million sterling in benefit for\r\nthose fifteen months; of this amount the State will ultimately contribute\r\none-quarter of the whole as against one-fifth under the permanent scheme\r\nof the Act of 1920, and the liability of the State will continue at the\r\nhigher figure until the end of the emergency period. For the financial\r\nyear 1922-23, the estimates provided for £12,196,130 as the State’s\r\ncontribution to the Insurance Fund and £551,760 to the Dependents’ Fund,\r\nmaking a total of £12,747,890. In April fourteen millions of the twenty\r\nmillion borrowing powers conferred on the Minister of Labour by the Act\r\nof July, 1921, were exhausted, and it was estimated that the whole\r\ntwenty millions would be exhausted by July 1922. The Act of April, 1922,\r\ntherefore increased the borrowing powers of the Minister from twenty\r\nmillions to thirty millions sterling.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Efficiency of the State Scheme\r\n\r\nThis was investigated by the Committee on National Expenditure (_see_\r\nFirst Report _Parliamentary Paper_, 1922, Cmd. 1581, p. 144). They\r\nrecommended, and properly so, that the question should be carefully\r\nexplored of placing unemployment insurance on the basis of insurance by\r\nindustry. They also urged an investigation by a committee of experts of\r\nthe administration of the State scheme with a view to its improvement.\r\nVery considerable simplification and improvement would appear to be\r\npossible judging from the report of Sir Alfred Watson, the distinguished\r\nGovernment Actuary. The cost to the taxpayer of Unemployment Insurance\r\nand Employment Exchanges since 1912-13 is stated in the Report of the\r\nCommittee on National Expenditure to be as follows:\r\n\r\n  -------+--------------+-------------+------------+------------+---------\r\n         |              |Appropriation| Net Charge |            |\r\n         |Administrative|     from    |to Exchequer| Government |  Total\r\n         |     cost     | Unemployment| on account |Contribution|Charge to\r\n         |   (gross).   |     Fund.   | of Admini- |  to Fund.  |  Votes.\r\n         |              |             |  stration. |            |\r\n  -------+--------------+-------------+------------+------------+---------\r\n         |      £       |      £      |      £     |      £     |    £\r\n  1912/13|    640,000   |    151,000  |    489,000 |    378,000 |  867,000\r\n  1913/14|    769,000   |    246,000  |    523,000 |    602,000 |1,125,000\r\n  1914/15|    764,000   |    227,000  |    537,000 |    546,000 |1,083,000\r\n  1915/16|    834,000   |    231,000  |    603,000 |    538,000 |1,141,000\r\n  1916/17|    905,000   |    329,000  |    576,000 |    746,000 |1,322,000\r\n  1917/18|  1,168,000   |    445,000  |    723,000 |  1,007,000 |1,730,000\r\n  1918/19|  1,950,000   |    455,000  |  1,495,000 |    994,000 |2,489,000\r\n  1919/20|  3,613,000   |    459,000  |  3,154,000 |    912,000 |4,066,000\r\n  1920/21|  4,593,000   |  1,115,000  |  3,478,000 |  2,200,000 |5,678,000\r\n  1921/22|  6,039,000   |  3,250,000  |  2,789,000 |  6,720,000 |9,509,000\r\n  1922/23|  5,020,000   |  4,150,000  |    870,000 |  8,231,000 |9,101,000\r\n  -------+--------------+-------------+------------+------------+---------\r\n\r\nThe above figures do not include the cost of the Unemployed Workers’\r\nDependents Act, which is financed independently of the Unemployment\r\nFund and which imposes on the Vote charges of £2,192,000 in 1921/22 and\r\n£670,000 in 1922/23.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment, one thing is certain: if the National Unemployment\r\nScheme had not been administered, as it has been, by the Ministry of\r\nLabour through the past and present dark days of depression, there\r\nwould have been a serious upheaval in this country. The very fact that\r\na worker could go and discuss his position with a sympathetic official\r\nof the Labour Exchanges helped to soothe his feelings of resentment\r\nagainst his unhappy lot. The receipt of benefit over the counter of\r\na State institution encouraged him to believe that the State took\r\nan interest in the welfare of himself and his dependents. Whether,\r\ntherefore, unemployment insurance by industries as a whole or each\r\nindustry separately may or may not be arranged in the future, it would\r\nbe exceedingly ungrateful of the people in this country to overlook the\r\nnational work that has been performed by the Ministry of Labour and the\r\nofficials of the Employment Exchanges under most difficult circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. CONSTRUCTION OF WORKS OF PUBLIC UTILITY\r\n\r\n\r\nUnemployment Grants Committee\r\n\r\nIn December 1920, the Government decided financially to assist local\r\nauthorities to enable them to put in hand works of public utility in\r\norder to relieve unemployment, and appointed the Unemployment Grants\r\nCommittee, under Lord St. Davids as Chairman, to receive applications for\r\ngrants, examine schemes and allocate funds.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Scheme of 1920\r\n\r\nThe Committee was instructed to observe, amongst others, these general\r\nprinciples:\r\n\r\n1. Works were to be approved only in cases where the Ministry of Labour\r\ncertified that serious unemployment, not otherwise provided for, existed\r\nin the area administered by the local authority undertaking the work.\r\n\r\n2. The works were to be such as would be approved by the appropriate\r\nGovernment Department as suitable works of public utility.\r\n\r\n3. The grant was not in any case to exceed 30 per cent. of the wages bill\r\nof additional men taken on for the work.\r\n\r\n4. Preference in employment was to be given to unemployed ex-Service men.\r\n\r\nThe powers of the Committee were subsequently extended as follows:\r\n\r\n(i) The grants could be increased from 30 per cent. to 60 per cent. of\r\nthe wages bill.\r\n\r\n(ii) The Committee was authorized to assist, in addition to local\r\nauthorities, (_a_) “public bodies”—being any board, commission, rating\r\nauthority or trustees, or other body or persons who manage or undertake\r\nworks in pursuance of statutory powers, not being a body trading for\r\nprofit, and (_b_) through the local authority—boards of guardians,\r\ndistress committees and voluntary agencies.\r\n\r\nA sum of £2,000,000 was placed at the Committee’s disposal for the\r\nfinancial year 1921-22, and a further sum of £630,000 for 1922-23. All\r\nthis money has been allocated, though not spent (see Table p. 189),\r\nand has provided, or is providing, direct employment for approximately\r\n110,000 men for varying periods. Nearly as many more are indirectly\r\nemployed in the preparation of materials for use on the approved works in\r\nfactories, workshops, quarries, etc. Almost 3,000 applications from local\r\nauthorities have been considered in detail, of which over 2,000 have been\r\ngranted. The total capital cost of the works so financially assisted is\r\nestimated at approximately £9,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Extended Scheme of 1921\r\n\r\nIn September 1921, the Government directed the Unemployment Grants\r\nCommittee to undertake the administration of a further scheme for the\r\nrelief of unemployment through local authorities. The new scheme provided\r\nfor giving to local authorities, who put in hand works of public utility\r\nfor the relief of unemployment, financial assistance on the following\r\nbasis:\r\n\r\n(_a_) _In the case of revenue-producing works_: Grants equivalent to 50\r\nper cent. of the interest for five years on loans raised for a period of\r\nnot less than 10 years in order to meet expenditure oil approved schemes.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _In the case of non-revenue-producing works_: Grants equal to 65\r\nper cent. of the interest and sinking fund charges on loans, raised to\r\nmeet expenditure on approved schemes for a period of half the term of the\r\nloan, subject to a maximum period of fifteen years’ grant. Both classes\r\nof grants were conditional on the work being commenced before January\r\n1, 1922, and completed before March 31, 1923. The commencing date was,\r\nhowever, subsequently extended. A provisional limit of £10,000,000 was\r\noriginally fixed as the total capital value of the approved works to\r\nwhich these two grants were to be applied. Local authorities, however,\r\ntook up the Government proposals with so much enthusiasm, and the work of\r\nexamining and approving the Schemes was accomplished so expeditiously,\r\nthat by the end of 1921 schemes to the capital value of nearly\r\n£10,000,000 had been approved, and many others were under consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Government accordingly decided, in December 1921, to increase from\r\n£10,000,000 to £13,000,000 the capital value of the works which might\r\nbe approved for these grants; and on the further development of the\r\nwork, in January 1922, again extended the limit from £13,000,000 up to\r\n£18,000,000. Works up to the limit are certain to be approved. Up to May\r\n31, 1922, the capital value of the works approved was:\r\n\r\n    Revenue-producing works                    £4,587,005\r\n    Non-revenue-producing works                12,655,358\r\n                                              -----------\r\n                                        Total £17,242,363\r\n\r\n    (For details, _see_ Table p. 190)\r\n\r\nThe amount of direct employment which it is estimated will be given by\r\nthese works is 629,113 men-months. The amount of employment indirectly\r\ngiven in the preparation of materials will probably amount to as much\r\nmore. The cost to the Exchequer of the national financial assistance\r\nafforded to these works must necessarily at the present time be somewhat\r\nof an estimate, as the loans raised by the assisted authorities are\r\nfor varying periods, with the result that the grants vary from periods\r\nof two-and-a-half up to fifteen years. The burden to the State is a\r\ndiminishing one, and is spread over a period of fifteen years, but the\r\ntotal amount of the burden so distributed will probably amount to about\r\n£8,700,000.\r\n\r\nThe work done by the Unemployment Grants Committee has been of an\r\nextraordinarily difficult and complicated character and most capably\r\ndirected. It has been no easy task to exercise a wise and statesmanlike\r\ndiscretion, amid the welter of proposals, the pressure for financial\r\nassistance and the stringent limitation on the latter. So far as it is\r\npossible to administer relief works on a sound basis the Committee has\r\nachieved it.\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF APPROVED SCHEMES ASSISTED ON THE BASIS OF 60 PER CENT.

EXPEDITED ROAD SCHEMES\r\n\r\nTo meet the extension of unemployment, in the autumn of 1920, the\r\nGovernment created a special fund for expediting the construction of\r\nnew arterial roads and the improvement of existing roads of importance.\r\nThe fund amounted to £10,400,000, consisting of: (1) £4,000,000 to be\r\ncontributed from the Road Fund (established under Sections 2 and 3 of\r\nthe Roads Act, 1920, from the proceeds of the duties on mechanically\r\npropelled vehicles and horse-drawn carriages and drivers’ licences,\r\nless £600,000 payable to Local Taxation Account); (2) £1,200,000 to\r\nbe contributed by the Treasury, and (3) £5,200,000 in loans from the\r\nTreasury to local authorities. The scheme provided for a grant from\r\nthis fund to local authorities who expedited road works approved\r\nby the Ministry of Transport, of one-half of the cost, and if the\r\nlocal authorities were not able to find the other half, for a loan\r\nfor that amount repayable within five years, at Treasury rate of\r\ninterest. A condition was that one-half of the cost of the work should\r\nbe labour cost; if the latter fell below one-half, the grant would\r\nbe proportionately reduced. In addition the Government passed the\r\nUnemployment (Relief Works) Act, 1920, on December 3, 1920, which by\r\nthe Expiring Laws Continuance Act, 1921, is continued in force till\r\nDecember 31, 1922. This Act expedites and simplifies the procedure for\r\ncompulsorily acquiring and entering into possession of land for works of\r\npublic utility intended to mitigate unemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 1920-21 Programme\r\n\r\nOn March 31, 1921, the commitments on this special fund, in respect of\r\nroad works commenced to relieve unemployment, were as follows:\r\n\r\n    ---------------------+---------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n                         |  No. of |           |           |\r\n                         | Schemes.|   Grant.  |    Loan.  |  Total.\r\n    ---------------------+---------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n                         |         |     £     |     £     |     £\r\n    Metropolitan area    |   23    | 1,200,000 |   623,000 | 1,823,000\r\n    Remainder of England,|         |           |           |\r\n      Wales and Scotland |  130    | 1,762,000 | 1,255,000 | 3,017,000\r\n                         |         |           |           +-----------\r\n                         |         |           |           |£4,840,000\r\n    ---------------------+---------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n\r\nA description of the schemes will be found in the “Report on the Road\r\nFund for 1920-21,” _Parliamentary Paper_, 1921, Cmd. 245.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 1921-22 Programme\r\n\r\nThe continuance of unemployment necessitated still further efforts, and\r\nin the autumn of 1921 the Government, with the assistance of the Ministry\r\nof Transport, again took action. It was decided to allocate a further sum\r\nof £2,000,000 from the Road Fund for road works in areas in which the\r\nMinistry of Labour certified that serious unemployment existed, for the\r\nrelief of which no other provision was available. This sum of £2,000,000\r\nwas allocated as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) £1,000,000 to special road schemes estimated to cost £2,250,000 in\r\nEssex and Kent to be carried out by unemployed labour resident within the\r\nCounty of London, the Government undertaking to provide the difference\r\nbetween the cost of the works £2,250,000 and the £1,000,000 contributed\r\nby the Road Fund, viz., £1,250,000 less such contributions as could be\r\nobtained from the local authorities in whose districts the roads were\r\nsituated.\r\n\r\n(2) £1,000,000 to road works in the provinces other than the schemes\r\nreferred to under (1).\r\n\r\nThe allocations for the unemployment road programmes of 1920-21, and the\r\nabove for 1921-22 overlapped; a readjustment was necessary. The present\r\nreadjusted allocations are now as follows:\r\n\r\n    1. _1920-21 Programme._               £\r\n        (1) London (Arterial Roads)  1,139,364\r\n        (2) Metropolitan Area           96,437\r\n        (3) Provinces                2,260,093\r\n        (4) Reserve                    489,106\r\n                                     ---------\r\n                                               { £3,065,000 Road Fund.\r\n                                    £3,985,000 { £920,000 Exchequer\r\n                                     --------- {   Contribution.\r\n\r\n(The £920,000 Exchequer contribution represents the authorized total of\r\ncommitments against the £1,200,000 provided in Sub-head B. of the Road\r\nGrants (Unemployment Relief) Vote, 1921-22; the balance viz., £280,000,\r\nhas been surrendered.)\r\n\r\n    2. _1921-22 Programme._\r\n        (1) Special London Schemes: (_a_) Road Fund         £1,000,000\r\n                                    (_b_) Ministry of Health (U.R.)\r\n                                          Vote £1,250,000, less local\r\n                                          authorities’ contributions.\r\n        (2) Other Schemes (Road Fund)                       £1,935,000\r\n\r\n    3. _Loans to Local Authorities under Sub-head A. of Road\r\n          Grants—Unemployment Relief-Vote._\r\n        (1) In respect of the schemes under the 1920-21\r\n          programme, as above, up to a total of             £3,985,000\r\n        (2) in respect of schemes to be transferred from\r\n          the 1920-21 programme to the 1921-22 programme\r\n          up to a total of                                     402,671\r\n                                                            ----------\r\n                                                            £4,387,671\r\n                                                            ----------\r\n\r\nThe total commitments, therefore, in respect of road works to relieve\r\nunemployment are £12,557,671, less the local authorities’ contributions\r\nunder 2 (1) (_b_) above.\r\n\r\nBy the end of February 1922, the funds had been fully allocated to\r\nparticular schemes, although in a few cases the details had not been\r\ncompletely settled nor the grants finally made.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Special Metropolitan Schemes\r\n\r\nFollowing the practice of 1920-21, a separate allocation was made in\r\n1921-22 for dealing with unemployment in the Metropolitan Police Area.\r\nThe distress in that area is relatively so serious that special steps\r\nhad to be taken to cope with it. The conclusion, without doubt rightly\r\ncome to by the Ministry of Transport, was that it was better to carry\r\nout schemes in Essex and Kent on which a large number of men could be\r\nemployed than road works in the built-up metropolitan area on which only\r\na small number could be usefully engaged. The labour engaged on these\r\nworks is obtained through the Labour Exchanges in London.\r\n\r\nThe special London Schemes are as follows:\r\n\r\n    (1) Widening and improvement of the London-Tilbury Road,\r\n    including new by-passes at Rainham and Purfleet.\r\n\r\n    (2) Construction of new road 21 miles in length from Tilbury to\r\n    Southend in continuation of the Greater London “Eastern Avenue”\r\n    already in progress.\r\n\r\n    (3) Widening and improvement of existing trunk roads in North\r\n    Kent:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Erith-Dartford Road.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) London-Folkestone Road.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) London-Dover Road.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) Watling Street (Dartford-Strood).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Provincial Schemes\r\n\r\nIn the provinces so large a number of schemes have been put in hand that\r\nonly a few typical cases can be mentioned.\r\n\r\n    Wallasey is widening her principal exit to the Wirral area and\r\n    Birkenhead.\r\n\r\n    Middlesex County Council is undertaking the widening to 60 feet\r\n    of Kingsbury Road, which connects Kingsbury, Hendon and Harrow.\r\n\r\n    Lancashire County Council is constructing anew road so that\r\n    through traffic between Preston and Liverpool may “by-pass”\r\n    Ormskirk. They are also improving the road from Liverpool to\r\n    Prescot, parts of the existing road being widened, and the line\r\n    and width of the remainder being improved by new construction.\r\n\r\n    Glasgow has widened an existing road and constructed two\r\n    sections of new road, thus affording a connection between her\r\n    principal south-western exits, and has also widened the road\r\n    to the south-east. In addition, a commencement is now being\r\n    made upon the widening to 80 feet of the road to Milngavie and\r\n    Paisley.\r\n\r\n    Bolton has taken in hand the widening to 60 feet of Wigan Road.\r\n\r\n    Coventry is constructing a new road which will connect two of\r\n    her north-western exits, and is widening to 50 feet Barker’s\r\n    Butts Lane, which will afford an additional convenient outlet\r\n    in the same direction.\r\n\r\n    Norwich is constructing a section of a ring road round the\r\n    city, including the erection of three new bridges.\r\n\r\n    Redcar and Eston are constructing a new road between Redcar and\r\n    Grangetown, part of a scheme for providing better communication\r\n    between Middlesbrough and Redcar.\r\n\r\n    Neath Rural District Council is constructing a new road through\r\n    the Dulaid Valley, which will be a great improvement upon the\r\n    winding, narrow and steep road that has hitherto been the only\r\n    route through this industrial area.\r\n\r\n    Plymouth has widened the main road from Devonport to the north,\r\n    and another road which will afford a less congested route from\r\n    Plymouth towards the west.\r\n\r\n    Birmingham has in hand several extensive road widenings,\r\n    forming part of her town planning scheme.\r\n\r\n    Southport is constructing a section of new road to enable\r\n    traffic to and from Liverpool to avoid an exceedingly narrow\r\n    portion of the existing road.\r\n\r\n    Durham County Council is constructing a section of new road\r\n    from Easington towards Hartlepool which will provide a much\r\n    shorter route for East Coast traffic.\r\n\r\n\r\nConditions Attaching to Grants\r\n\r\nSince the initiation of the 1921-22 Roads Programme, the following\r\nconditions have been attached to all grants made from the Road Fund\r\ntowards the cost of road works started with a view to relieving\r\nunemployment:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Unskilled labour to be employed to the fullest extent\r\n    practicable.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) All unskilled labour for a probationary period of six\r\n    months to receive a rate of wages not in excess of 75 per\r\n    cent. of the local authority’s rate for unskilled labour. This\r\n    requirement of a lower rate of wages than the prevailing local\r\n    rate does not apply in cases where the work is carried out by\r\n    contract.\r\n\r\n    The reduced rate of 75 per cent. does not apply to skilled men,\r\n    employed in their trade, nor to properly qualified navvies.\r\n\r\n    In cases where the men are employed for not more than three\r\n    days in the week the reduced rate applicable is increased from\r\n    75 per cent. to a maximum of 87½ per cent.\r\n\r\n    The probationary period may include the time during which\r\n    the man has been employed on Government-assisted works under\r\n    previous schemes.\r\n\r\n    The reduced rate (for the probationary period) must be\r\n    calculated to the nearest farthing per hour.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) All unskilled labour to be obtained through the\r\n    Employment Exchanges, which give preference to ex-Service men,\r\n    and do not submit unskilled men for engagement unless they have\r\n    been registered at an Employment Exchange for at least seven\r\n    days.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. POOR LAW RELIEF\r\n\r\nIn this country the traditional method of alleviating distress resulting\r\nfrom unemployment has been by Poor Law relief administered by Boards of\r\nGuardians. During 1920 and 1921, many persons who were uninsured and\r\nfaced with destitution, and many persons who, though insured, found\r\nthe benefit insufficient for the maintenance of themselves and their\r\nfamilies, came to the Guardians for relief. There were three times as\r\nmany people in receipt of out-door relief during the winter of 1921-22\r\nas there were in 1915, and two and a half times as many as in 1910.\r\nThis has necessitated the raising of large sums by Guardians and heavy\r\nincreases in the Poor Law element in local rates. The administration of\r\nout-door relief under circumstances such as the present is a matter of\r\nthe greatest difficulty. Guardians are, not unnaturally, disposed on\r\nhumane grounds to give relief on as generous a scale as possible, which\r\nvaries according to the Guardians’ views and the district. On the other\r\nhand, this results in heavy charges on ratepayers, and a preference\r\nin many of the able-bodied recipients for doles instead of work, and\r\npossibly thereby an aggravation of unemployment. The general supervision\r\nof the work of the Guardians falls to the Ministry of Health, and that\r\nDepartment has undoubtedly discharged that invidious duty with judgment\r\nand efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrinciples Governing Administration of Relief\r\n\r\nBy a circular letter dated December 29, 1920, the Minister of Health\r\ndirected the attention of Guardians to the fact that under Article 12 of\r\nthe Relief Regulation Order, 1911, they could not grant outdoor relief on\r\na wholesale scale, or depart from the standard prescribed by that article\r\nunless under special circumstances—they were, therefore, bound to examine\r\ninto the special circumstances of each particular case, and report to\r\nhim any departure from the ordinary practice. This was a most necessary\r\nadmonition in view of the amount being distributed from State funds\r\nin the shape of out-of-work donation and pensions. Again, by Circular\r\n240 dated September 8, 1921, the Minister of Health reverted to this\r\nimportant matter and indicated the rules which, in his opinion, and that\r\nof the Association of Poor Law Unions, should govern the administration\r\nof relief. The first was that as Poor Law relief should be restricted\r\nto what was necessary to relieve distress, the amount thereof should\r\nbe calculated on a lower scale than the earnings of the independent\r\nworkman maintaining himself by his own labour. I need hardly stop to\r\ncriticize the Labour contention that the relief should be of no less\r\namount than the full Trade Union rate of wages of the recipient—it would\r\nbe as demoralizing to the recipient as it would be disastrous to the\r\ncommunity. The second rule was that no relief should be given without\r\nfull investigation of the circumstances of each applicant, obtaining from\r\nthe latter a signed statement of the total income of the household from\r\nall sources. The third rule was that the greater proportion of the relief\r\ngranted should be given not in money but in kind, i.e. goods supplied\r\non presentation of an order drawn on the Guardians’ own out-relief\r\ndistribution stores or on local tradesmen. Guardians were further urged\r\nto make, by way of loan, all relief given to or on account of any person\r\nover twenty-one, or to his wife or any member of his family under\r\nsixteen, in cases where there was a reasonable prospect of the recipient\r\nbeing able to repay within a reasonable period.\r\n\r\n\r\nAscertainment of Applicant’s Income\r\n\r\nA very important scheme for the voluntary registration of income from\r\npublic sources such as pensions, allowances or grants from the Ministry\r\nof Pensions, or Local War Pensions Committees, unemployment benefit\r\nunder the Unemployment Insurance Acts, dependents’ allowances under\r\nthe Unemployed Workers’ Dependents (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921,\r\nand from other sources, was put into operation with great success in\r\ncertain local districts under the auspices of the National Council of\r\nSocial Service, which pressed the general adoption of the scheme upon\r\nthe Government. A somewhat analogous scheme was later outlined by the\r\nMinister of Health for districts where such voluntary registration\r\nschemes were not in operation, which is described in Circular 261\r\ndated November 23, 1921, and provided that similar information should\r\nbe communicated by the Government Departments concerned to Boards of\r\nGuardians. At the same time, the Minister warmly endorsed the principle\r\nof voluntary registration. Guardians ought, of course, before giving\r\nout-door relief, to ascertain the weekly income of all the members of an\r\napplicant’s household. The only sources of income which are not to be\r\nincluded are the first 5_s._ received from a Friendly Society as sick\r\npay (Outdoor Relief (Friendly Societies) Act, 1904) and the first 7_s._\r\n6_d._ of sickness benefit (National Insurance Act, 1911, as amended by\r\nthe National Health Insurance Act, 1920). On the other hand, Section 6\r\nof the Unemployed Workers’ Dependents (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921,\r\nsuspended during the currency of that Act (i.e. up to May 10, 1922) the\r\nprovisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, forbidding Guardians\r\nto take account of the first 10_s._ of unemployment benefit. Section 14\r\nof the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, made this suspension permanent\r\nand further enables benefit due to any person in respect of any period to\r\nbe paid to the Guardians, if and so far as they have given that person\r\nout-door relief which they would not have given if the benefit had been\r\npunctually paid.\r\n\r\n\r\nAssistance to Guardians to Carry out Works\r\n\r\nIn a number of cases the Minister of Health has facilitated the\r\nundertaking by Guardians of works of excavation, road improvement and\r\nthe like for the provision of employment, and has allowed a variation\r\nof the regulations in force so as to enable Guardians undertaking such\r\nworks to employ direct labour upon them instead of, as in the ordinary\r\ncourse, resorting to a contractor. In this way Guardians are enabled\r\nto select the labour from the ranks of those already destitute. In\r\nother cases in which Guardians have themselves been unable to provide\r\nany work, arrangements have been made by the Minister of Health by\r\nwhich works, which could not ordinarily be undertaken under the scheme\r\nof the Unemployment Grants Committee, are put in hand by the sanitary\r\nauthorities, the labour engaged being supplied by the Guardians, and, in\r\nview of the importance of providing work rather than relief, the Minister\r\nhas undertaken to give any sanction necessary to cover the contributions\r\nmade in this connection by the Guardians to the sanitary authorities\r\nexecuting the Works, so long as the poor-rate does not incur a charge\r\ngreater than the cost of relief which, but for the works, would have had\r\nto be given.\r\n\r\n\r\nFunding of Cost of Relief\r\n\r\nThe cost of relief is normally a charge upon the current rates. There\r\nhave been cases where the unexpected increase in the cost of relief\r\nresulting from unemployment upset the estimates of annual expenditure\r\nmade by the Guardians and placed them in serious financial difficulties;\r\nand again, others where this annual cost is so heavy as to place an\r\nunreasonable immediate burden upon the ratepayers. To meet these abnormal\r\ncases, power was given by the Local Authorities (Financial Provisions)\r\nAct, 1921, to fund the cost, and for that purpose to authorize the\r\nraising of temporary loans for a period not exceeding a maximum of ten\r\nyears. Temporary loans amounting, up to the middle of July, 1922, to\r\n£6,204,776 have been sanctioned by the Minister of Health under this\r\nAct, the usual period allowed for repayment being two years, though in\r\nseveral cases as much as five years has been allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nHelp to Poorer Metropolitan Unions\r\n\r\nPoor Law relief in London is always a matter of exceptional difficulty,\r\nand there has, since 1867, been a Common Poor Fund, through the agency\r\nof which certain Poor Law expenses are pooled and charged to the whole\r\nof the unions in London. During the war, this Fund was placed on a\r\nstereotyped basis, but with the rise of prices and with the growth\r\nof unemployment relief, hardship was caused to the poorer unions. An\r\nemergency arrangement was accordingly made for placing this Fund on an\r\nunstereotyped basis, much to the advantage of the poorer unions. Later,\r\nby the Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Act, 1921, certain\r\nadditional expenses in each union, and particularly the cost of out-door\r\nrelief, so far as this was given within a scale and subject to conditions\r\nprescribed by the Minister of Health, were added to the expenses of a\r\nunion chargeable on London as a whole. By this Act the burden of out-door\r\nrelief in boroughs such as Poplar has been very greatly lightened by\r\nbeing spread over the wealthier boroughs like Kensington and Westminster.\r\nThe Minister of Health, by Statutory Rules and Orders 1922, No. 3,\r\nprescribed the scale. It is, of course, within the power of Guardians to\r\nexceed the scale to meet exceptional needs in any particular case, but\r\nnot at the cost of the Common Poor Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\nAssistance to Guardians to Raise Loans\r\n\r\nIn cases where a Poor Law authority is in danger of being brought to a\r\nstandstill by inability to raise from other sources loans sanctioned by\r\nthe Minister for current expenditure, the Minister is empowered himself\r\nto advance the necessary money, on such terms and conditions as may be\r\nrecommended by a Committee established under the chairmanship of Sir\r\nHarry Goschen, K.B.E. Up to the middle of March 1922, it had only been\r\nnecessary to place three applications before this Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT POLICY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT\r\n\r\n    5.

GUARANTEE OF LOANS\r\n\r\nThe Trade Facilities Act, 1921, represents the most important of the\r\nconstructive proposals which resulted from the conferences held by the\r\nPrime Minister at Gairloch in the autumn of 1921. The general opinion\r\nof the experts summoned to those conferences was that a large amount\r\nof new constructional work (extension and electrification of railways,\r\nconstruction of docks, extension of manufacturing works, etc.), which\r\nwould normally have taken place during the war, still required to be\r\ncarried out, but that such work was being held up by the high costs\r\nof manufacture and the high rates which had to be paid for money. It\r\nwas felt that although much of this work was urgently needed for the\r\nproper service of the public handling of trade, the placing of orders\r\nmight be deferred indefinitely in the hope of a fall in prices, and\r\nmeanwhile the Government would be compelled to go on paying unemployment\r\ndoles. If, however, cheap money could be provided, one at least of the\r\nmain obstacles would be overcome, and this might in many cases afford\r\nsufficient inducement to commence the works immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Trade Facilities Act, 1921\r\n\r\nUnder the Trade Facilities Act, the Treasury is empowered to give a\r\nguarantee of principal and/or interest on a loan to be raised “by any\r\ngovernment, any public authority, or any corporation or other body\r\nof persons,” the proceeds of which loan are “applied towards or in\r\nconnection with the carrying out of any capital undertaking or in, or in\r\nconnection with, the purchase of articles, other than munitions of war,\r\nmanufactured or produced in the United Kingdom required for the purposes\r\nof any such undertaking, provided that the aggregate capital amount of\r\nthe loans, the principal or interest of which is guaranteed under this\r\nsection, shall not exceed the sum of twenty-five million pounds.” An\r\nAdvisory Committee—Sir Robert Kindersley, G.B.E., Sir William Plender,\r\nG.B.E., and Colonel Schuster, M.C.—was appointed to recommend to the\r\nTreasury, the cases in which, in its opinion, a guarantee should be given.\r\n\r\nThe Committee’s power is limited in two ways. In the first place it can\r\nonly recommend a guarantee on a loan (i.e. it cannot guarantee an issue\r\nof shares). In the second place, the Committee has no power to recommend\r\na guarantee “except for the purpose of a capital undertaking”(i.e. it\r\ncannot guarantee “working capital”). Many manufacturers in the country\r\nhave orders on hand from foreign purchasers which they are unable to\r\nexecute because they cannot finance themselves for the period between the\r\ndate on which the orders are put in hand and the date on which payment is\r\nreceived from the foreign purchaser. Cases of this sort come under the\r\nExport Credits Scheme, and not under this scheme. The Act empowers the\r\nCommittee to recommend a guarantee of a loan by a foreign Government,\r\nmunicipality or company, even though the articles (e.g. steel rails)\r\nmanufactured with the proceeds of the guaranteed Joan were to be erected\r\nor used outside this country, provided always that the proceeds of the\r\nguaranteed loan itself were spent on goods manufactured in the United\r\nKingdom.\r\n\r\nThe Trade Facilities Act thus enables new works to be undertaken which\r\nwould otherwise have been postponed indefinitely. This on the one hand\r\nprovides work directly and indirectly, and so avoids the demoralizing\r\ninfluence of the dole. On the other hand, if the scheme is wisely\r\nadministered, no liability should fall on the Government, that is to\r\nsay on the individual taxpayers. An assurance as to the wisdom of its\r\nadministration was afforded by the composition of the Committee itself,\r\ncombined with the pledge given by the Chancellor in the House of Commons\r\nthat the Government would not interfere with the Committee’s discretion.\r\nIt was thereby made certain that sound business considerations rather\r\nthan political expediency would be the guide to the Committee’s\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolicy of Advisory Committee\r\n\r\nWhile the greater part of the guarantees are given to companies and\r\nundertakings operating in Great Britain, the Committee considers that\r\n(subject, of course, to the material being bought in this country)\r\nit would help to advance general economic restoration if part of the\r\nfund were allotted to enterprises abroad, e.g. in the extension and\r\nimprovement of foreign railways. By that means the foreign country’s\r\nproductive and purchasing power would be increased and she would resume\r\nher place as a supplier of the world’s necessities and as a purchaser\r\nof the world’s—and Great Britain’s—manufactured goods. The difficulty,\r\nhowever, of dealing with foreign loans is that the countries which\r\nchiefly require assistance are those suffering from a heavily depreciated\r\ncurrency, and accordingly the service of a sterling loan would place so\r\nonerous a burden on them that it would be more than doubtful whether they\r\ncould bear it and meet their obligations. To find adequate security in\r\nsuch cases is, therefore, a great difficulty, to which there is added the\r\nunwillingness of such countries to pledge even the inadequate security\r\nwhich it is within their power to give, and the record of many of these\r\ncountries as regards their past obligations has not been such as to\r\ninspire confidence. The Committee keeps always before it the fact that\r\nit is a custodian of the Public Purse, and that much more harm than good\r\nwould be done by recommending guarantees in cases in which the risks are\r\ngreater than the principles of sound commercial prudence would accept.\r\n\r\nThe principles on which the Committee acts are these:\r\n\r\nFirst, that its principal duty is to assist in the extension of\r\nsound undertakings with proved good management which are deferring\r\nwell-thought-out plans of extensions or new works owing to the difficulty\r\nof raising money on reasonable terms under present abnormal conditions.\r\nIt does not feel that it is called upon to recommend a guarantee in cases\r\nof a speculative nature for which, even in normal times, the promoters\r\nwould have found difficulty in raising money. Nor does it think that it\r\nought to recommend guarantees to relieve undertakings from financial\r\nembarrassments incurred through lack of ordinary commercial foresight\r\non the part of those responsible for their management. A guiding rule\r\nis that the Government’s liability should be as small as possible, and\r\nthat a good commercial Security should be obtained in every case. In the\r\nsecond place, the Committee, realizing the gravity of the unemployment\r\nproblem and the demoralizing effect of the continued receipt of doles,\r\nprefers those schemes which can be put in operation immediately rather\r\nthan schemes which would take some considerable time to mature. In the\r\nthird place, the Committee favours schemes of public utility. These\r\nfall into two classes. In the first place, there is a public utility\r\nundertaking as ordinarily understood, i.e. a corporation working under\r\nstatutory powers and not trading for profit. In the second place are the\r\ncompanies, such as railway companies, which carry out an indispensable\r\nnational service, and which in actual practice cannot earn excessive\r\ndividends for their shareholders. The reason for this preference has been\r\npartly the direct benefit to the general community from the improved\r\nfacilities for the public thereby rendered possible, and partly the\r\nfeeling that the guarantee could more properly be given to undertakings\r\nin respect of which it was unlikely that Government assistance would\r\nresult in the earning of a large profit for private promoters and\r\nshareholders. In the fourth place, the Committee insists that all\r\ncontracts must be on the basis of competitive prices. It feels that it\r\nwould be wrong for the Government guarantee to be given in any case in\r\nwhich an unreasonably high price was going to be paid for the materials.\r\nNot only would such a course be unjust to the taxpayer by making the\r\nGovernment responsible for money going, not into wages and materials,\r\nbut in paying high profits to manufacturers; it would be against the\r\nbest interests of the country as a whole, since it would be impeding the\r\nreturn to a level of prices on which this country could meet foreign\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifficulties of the Committee\r\n\r\nThe Committee has encountered many difficulties. The most important\r\nof these has been the lengthy negotiations necessary in every case.\r\nFrequently, the application when submitted is not on lines which the\r\nCommittee feels justified in approving, and protracted discussions\r\nare required to reduce it to a business-like and acceptable form.\r\nThe Committee in fact has been in the position practically of an\r\nissuing house which had to issue £25,000,000 worth of securities of\r\nevery possible kind and variety in a very short time. Every one with\r\nexperience of this class of business will realize what that means. As\r\nthe Committee’s power is limited to recommending the guarantee of loans,\r\nit has found a difficulty in the fact that many companies, at the time\r\nof making their application, have not possessed the necessary borrowing\r\npowers. Meetings of shareholders and debenture holders have frequently\r\nbeen necessary in order that these powers might be sanctioned. In other\r\ncases, the companies have required Parliamentary approval for an increase\r\nin their loan capital. All of these difficulties have taken time to\r\nsurmount, but the Committee has always instructed applicants to start\r\nthe preliminary work of obtaining their tenders, etc., as soon as it\r\nhas decided the broad lines on which a guarantee could be given, so that\r\nreal work can be commenced and men employed from the very moment that the\r\nnecessary formalities are completed.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuarantees already Given\r\n\r\nGuarantees have been given in numerous cases. Work which otherwise would\r\nnot have been done has been provided in the shipbuilding and repairing\r\nbusiness, in the construction and improvement of docks and canals, in the\r\nextension of railways, in the electrification of railways, and in the\r\nextension of a number of electrical undertakings. This has facilitated\r\nthe employment of direct labour in a number of places, and in addition,\r\norders for the manufactured goods, principally cement and iron, have been\r\nplaced in the manufacturing towns of the North and Midlands. To take a\r\nconcrete instance, a guarantee has been given to the London Underground\r\nRailways for extensions. This means an immense amount of direct\r\nemployment; it entails the placing of large orders for new locomotives\r\nand rolling stock. The men for whom employment has been found would\r\notherwise have been living on the dole. Not only is their moral improved,\r\nbut their purchasing power is increased, and the prosperity of industries\r\nas a whole has been fostered. Further, new tracts of country will be\r\nopened up for the Londoner and an impetus given to the construction of\r\nhouses in suburban areas. This example, which is chosen at random from\r\na number of others, shows the beneficial effect for the community as a\r\nwhole, of the guarantees which have been given under the Trade Facilities\r\nAct.\r\n\r\nTwo White Papers (1922)—62 and 121—state that up to June 29, 1922, the\r\nTreasury has stated its willingness to guarantee principal and interest\r\non loans of an amount of £17,042,143 for periods of years varying from\r\nfour to twenty-five in respect of a number of enterprises of which the\r\nfollowing are typical: Harland & Wolff (£1,493,345), ship repairing works\r\non Thames and dock and wharf on Clyde; South Eastern & Chatham Railway\r\nCompany’s Managing Committee (£6,500,000), electrification of suburban\r\nlines; London Electric Railways Company (£6,000,000), enlargement\r\nof tunnel of City and South London Railway, and extension of London\r\nElectric Railway from Golders Green to Edgware; Calcutta Electric Supply\r\nCorporation (£500,000), purchase of generating and transforming plant and\r\ncables; Rhymney Valley Sewerage Board (£250,000), sewage disposal and\r\nsewerage scheme for urban districts in Rhymney Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. THE EXPORT CREDITS SCHEME\r\n\r\nUnder the Overseas Trade (Credits and Insurance) Act, 1920, the Overseas\r\n(Credits and Insurance) Amendment Act, 1921, and the Trade Facilities\r\nAct, 1921, the Government has done much to relieve unemployment by\r\nassisting the manufacturer to export his goods from the United Kingdom.\r\nThe Government’s plan is known as the “Export Credits Scheme”; it is\r\nadministered by the Department of Overseas Trade. Its main essential\r\nis that the Government will guarantee bills drawn by United Kingdom\r\nexporters on customers abroad as against shipment of goods exported from\r\nthe United Kingdom, when such bills are submitted through the exporter’s\r\nbanker with the banker’s recommendation for guarantee attached, and the\r\ncircumstances are such as bring the case within the scheme. The goods\r\nmust be commodities (other than arms and ammunition) wholly or partly\r\nproduced or manufactured in the United Kingdom, and include coal; but the\r\nGovernment will not assist to finance goods to be shipped on consignment,\r\nor the carrying of stocks either in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. The\r\nsum of outstanding credits must not at any one time exceed twenty-six\r\nmillions sterling. The sum now outstanding is sixteen millions.\r\n\r\nA lucid statement of the history, nature and working of the scheme by Sir\r\nPhilip Lloyd-Greame, M.P., the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department\r\nof Overseas Trade, appears in the _Accountant_ for February 4, 1922.\r\nThe scheme does not supplant, but supplements, the ordinary commercial\r\nmachinery of finance by providing credit in cases where, although the\r\ntrade involved is inherently sound, bankers and financial houses are\r\nnot disposed, or in a position, to supply the necessary accommodation.\r\nThe closest co-operation is maintained with the banks. By letter of\r\nOctober 14, 1921, from the Bankers’ Clearing House to the President of\r\nthe Board of Trade, which appears in the _Accountant_, the Committee of\r\nLondon Clearing House Bankers expressed their willingness “to take all\r\nsuch steps as lay within their power to encourage the operation of the\r\nscheme, especially having regard to the object which the Government had\r\nin view, that of ameliorating the present conditions of unemployment.”\r\nThe Department of Overseas Trade is assisted by an expert and experienced\r\nbusiness committee representative of the Joint Stock Banks, the Eastern\r\nBanks, the Accepting and Discount Houses, and manufacturers and merchants.\r\n\r\nThe scheme now applies to all countries in the world, but not to British\r\nIndia, Ceylon and the Straits Settlements, where there are large\r\nunabsorbed stocks and in respect of which adequate banking facilities\r\nexist, nor to Russia. New credits may be granted up to September 8,\r\n1923, but all credits must be liquidated by September 8, 1927. Credits\r\nof two kinds are granted—“specific credits,” and “general credits.” The\r\nformer are given in respect of particular transactions, for example, the\r\ncompletion of a large engineering or constructional contract abroad; the\r\nlatter are credits up to specified amounts for specified countries and\r\nfor specified periods in respect of goods not necessarily sold at the\r\ntime the credits are given, and are intended to meet the convenience\r\nof merchants doing business abroad on short term credits. A United\r\nKingdom merchant selling small quantities of commodities abroad through\r\nsome travelling representative finds it quite impossible to submit\r\neach transaction to the approval of the Export Credits Department. The\r\nmerchant can thus enter into transactions abroad up to the amount of the\r\ngeneral credit without any reference to the Department, while the latter\r\nundertakes to guarantee the bills drawn within the agreed period for the\r\ngoods that are shipped. The bills carrying the Department’s guarantee are\r\nregarded in the discount market as “first-class bills.” The Department\r\nprefers that the bills should be of as short duration as possible, but\r\npermits renewals provided that the credit is not extended beyond twelve\r\nmonths. With the Government guarantee that the bill drawn by the foreign\r\ncustomer or his agent will be met, the United Kingdom exporting merchant\r\ncan thus borrow on the security of the bill at the ordinary market rate\r\nin the customary way.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecific Guarantees or Credits\r\n\r\nIn case of specific credits the Department will guarantee up to 100 per\r\ncent. of the bills drawn against the shipment where the credit does not\r\nexceed twelve months, and up to 85 per cent. in cases where the credit\r\nexceeds twelve months. Two bills, in the latter case, are usually drawn,\r\none for 85 per cent. of the transaction which is guaranteed for the full\r\namount of the draft, and the second for the balance of 15 per cent. which\r\nis not guaranteed. The Department does not require a bill to be accepted\r\nbefore guaranteeing it. If security is to be deposited by the importer,\r\nthe Department requires a letter of guarantee from the importer’s bank,\r\nwhich must be an approved bank, that the bill will be accepted and\r\nthat approved security will be deposited immediately upon the first\r\npresentation of the documents to the importer, and the Department\r\nassesses the value of the security so deposited. If no security is to be\r\ndeposited, the Department requires a similar letter of guarantee, or some\r\nother satisfactory evidence that the bill will be accepted.\r\n\r\nIn case of default by the importer to accept or meet the bill when due,\r\nthe Government has no recourse against the United Kingdom exporter\r\nwhere the importer, in the first instance, deposited security assessed\r\nas sufficient by the Department to cover the whole amount guaranteed.\r\nThe importer may, however, have put up some security, but security not\r\ndeemed enough by the Department to cover the whole amount guaranteed. In\r\nthat event, the Department retains recourse against the United Kingdom\r\nexporter for 50 per cent. (when 85 per cent. or less of the bill has been\r\nguaranteed), or for 57½ per cent. (when 100 per cent. of the bill has\r\nbeen guaranteed) of the difference between the amount guaranteed, on the\r\none hand, and, on the other, the total of the amount (if any) paid by the\r\nimporter, plus the amount which the security was accepted as sufficient\r\nto cover or which the security, when realized, yields, whichever is the\r\ngreater. When the importer puts up no security the Government retains\r\nrecourse against the United Kingdom exporter for 50 per cent. of the\r\ndifference between the amount guaranteed and the amount (if any) paid\r\nby the importer, where 85 per cent. or less of the amount of the bill\r\nhas been guaranteed; where 100 per cent. has been guaranteed—for 57½ per\r\ncent. of that difference.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Guarantees or Credits\r\n\r\nIn the case of general credits, when the Government accedes to an\r\napplication made through a bank, say, to guarantee for six months bills\r\nup to a sum of £10,000 drawn by some particular United Kingdom exporter\r\nas against shipment of goods to Rumania, the Government would guarantee\r\neach bill up to its total value at such rate of commission as the\r\nDepartment may fix. At the end of the six months, if the amount of the\r\nguaranteed bills totals up to, say, £9,000, that represents the liability\r\nof the Government. When afterwards the bills fall due, and there is any\r\nloss, the Government has recourse on the United Kingdom exporter for 57½\r\nper cent. of the ultimate loss. The Government does not require that any\r\nsecurity shall be put up by the importer, but is prepared to consider the\r\noffering of special terms when security is put up.\r\n\r\nThe Government is also prepared to make arrangements with approved\r\nbanks, banking houses, and credit associations under which, for an\r\nagreed premium, the Government will assume responsibility for a share\r\nnot exceeding 70 per cent. of any loss incurred by such banks, etc.,\r\nin respect of transactions carried through by them for United Kingdom\r\nexporters, which comply with the same conditions as to the nature of the\r\ngoods as those prescribed under the Export Credits Scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. OTHER MISCELLANEOUS SCHEMES\r\n\r\nMoney has been allocated by the Government to assist schemes of land\r\nimprovement, drainage and farm water-supplies so as to provide employment\r\nfor agricultural workers, also forestry schemes and light railways:\r\n\r\n    _Ministry of Agriculture:_                              £\r\n      Land Drainage                                      388,000\r\n        Of this £113,000 is recoverable from drainage\r\n          boards and landowners.\r\n      Farm water-supplies                                  9,600\r\n        The balance of cost, £18,600, is borne by\r\n          landowners.\r\n    _Scottish Board of Agriculture:_\r\n      Land Drainage (half cost of schemes)                21,000\r\n    _Forestry Commission:_\r\n      Unemployment schemes in addition to the normal\r\n        estimates                                        206,000\r\n      Additional expenditure thereon by landowners\r\n        and local authorities                            141,000\r\n\r\nIn the sum of £5,500,000 set aside during the winter 1921-22 for general\r\nunemployment relief, provision was made for assistance to approved light\r\nrailway schemes. Up to June, 1922, two such schemes had been approved for\r\ngrants from the Treasury equal to half the total cost, subject to maximum\r\ngrants of £162,500 in all.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time steps have been taken to assist in relieving the\r\nsituation by special measures operating in Government industrial\r\nestablishments. A short-time system was introduced into War Office\r\nand Admiralty establishments to spread employment. The highest number\r\nof additional men thus engaged was 9,900. No additional men are now\r\nemployed. Alternative work, e.g. waggon repairing, manufacture of medals,\r\ncoin-blanks, locomotives, new wagons and miscellaneous articles for the\r\nPost Office and for private firms, has been carried out in War Office and\r\nAdmiralty establishments. The highest number of men employed thereon was\r\n8,800. The Office of Works undertook an emergency programme of decorative\r\nand repair work in Government Departments during the winter 1920-21,\r\nwhen the highest number of additional men thus engaged was 2,600. During\r\nthe winter 1921-22, this Department also undertook relief work in the\r\nRoyal Parks, the highest number of additional men employed on this work\r\nbeing 390. The expenditure in both classes of scheme was about £127,000.\r\nThe sum of £563,000 was also set aside during the winter 1921-22 for\r\naccelerating Government contracts whereby employment was found for some\r\n600 men.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary of National Expenditure\r\n\r\nAs between the Armistice and May 19, 1922, there has been devoted to the\r\nrelief of unemployment out of public funds the total sum of £281,216,460,\r\nunder the following heads:\r\n\r\n    1. _Granted by Government:_                              £\r\n      (1) Unemployment Relief Works                      26,819,600\r\n      (2) Out-of-Work Donation and Unemployment\r\n            Benefit                                     144,000,000\r\n      (3) Resettlement Training }\r\n          Civil Liabilities     }                        31,972,000\r\n          Overseas Settlement   }\r\n      (4) Export Credits Scheme                          26,000,000\r\n      (5) Guarantee of Loans                             25,000,000\r\n      (6) Accelerated Government Contracts                  563,000\r\n      (7) Land Settlement of Ex-Service Men               1,523,860\r\n      (8) Loans to County Councils for Small Holdings\r\n            for Ex-Service Men                           12,269,000\r\n                                                        -----------\r\n                                                        268,147,460\r\n    2. _Appropriations from Non-Government Sources:_\r\n      (1) Contributions by Local Authorities to 1 (1)\r\n            above                                        12,694,000\r\n      (2) Contributions from National Relief Fund to\r\n           1 (3) above                                      375,000\r\n                                                       ------------\r\n                                                       £281,216,460\r\n                                                       ------------\r\n\r\nIn addition, local authorities have initiated, without Government\r\nassistance, relief works on which, between the commencement of trade\r\ndepression in September 1920, and May 19, 1922, an aggregate of wages of\r\nat least £450,000 has been paid. Guardians have during the same period\r\nexpended at least £60,000,000 on out-door relief. The above figures\r\nexclude the temporary loans by the Ministry of Health to embarrassed\r\nGuardians.\r\n\r\nThe really critical time in regard to unemployment will be the\r\nforthcoming winter, 1922-23. Trade Union out-of-work benefits have shrunk\r\nand dwindled through lack of funds. Homes and furniture, utensils, etc.,\r\nwith two winters’ hard times have wasted down to the bare bone, clothing\r\nis worn out, and there is little or no reserve of resources; in some\r\ndistricts conditions fill one with apprehension. Added to the natural\r\ngravity—social and economic—of the situation, is the quite definite\r\nattempt of the Communists to exploit subterraneously these unhappy\r\ncircumstances for revolutionary purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart III\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE LABOUR POLICY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE OUTLOOK OF THE WORKER\r\n\r\n    Ignorance about Industry—Misconceptions as to Wages—Discontent\r\n    and its Causes—Effect of Bad Environment—Fear of\r\n    Unemployment—Dissatisfaction with Status in Industry—Belief\r\n    in Agitation—Desire for Improvement—Low Conception of\r\n    Work—Suspicion of Employers—The Worker and his Trade Union—The\r\n    Worker and the Community.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy endeavour, henceforward, will be to state, as concisely and clearly\r\nas the subject permits, the main principles of policy which, in my\r\njudgment, should be applied to industry and its problems. As a necessary\r\npreliminary one must indicate the characteristics of the worker, his\r\nsentiments and aspirations, his defects, his virtues. After years of\r\ncontinual intercourse with labour, I confess my failure to meet in the\r\nflesh the workers as depicted in current revolutionary publications;\r\nnor have I succeeded in discovering among them that alien race with\r\nsympathies and sensibilities different from those of the rest of the\r\ncommunity, ever moved by materialistic motives, always pursuing some\r\nirrational course of foolish selfishness as described in another type\r\nof literature. Against the unwarranted accusation that the British\r\nworking-man in his opinions, feelings and sentiments is at all a\r\ndifferent person from the ordinary British citizen, I have never ceased\r\nto protest. That he often suffers from a limited outlook, reacts to\r\nprejudice, and cherishes at times a grudge against society, I am not\r\ngoing to deny; but after working among workers, and, later, spending\r\na great part of the war-period in controlling one million workmen of\r\nevery description, and meeting in familiar intercourse their Trade Union\r\nexecutives, their district committees and their own deputations in\r\nnumerous shops and yards, I can truthfully say that I generally found\r\nthe worker a human being who is open to reason and to acceptance of a\r\nview substantially fair and just, once his ignorance is dissipated,\r\nhis prejudices removed, and his humanity recognized. He has, however,\r\nno patience for humbug, rhetoric or cant. The trouble is that he has\r\nnot been treated in the past as a sentient and rational person by\r\npoliticians, or even his own Trade Union leaders—the main cause of our\r\npresent industrial difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\nIgnorance about Industry\r\n\r\nWhen in retrospect I recall my impression of the outstanding\r\ncharacteristic of the British working-man as I knew him in the workshops,\r\nI unhesitatingly fasten on his appalling ignorance of economic matters.\r\nFew of the “rank and file” have any conception whatsoever of the factors\r\nand forces which constitute that type of economic activity known as\r\nindustry, still less of the contribution of industry to our national\r\nprosperity. And in regard to commerce and its part as the handmaiden\r\nof industry, their ignorance is even more profound. There never plays\r\nupon their imagination the least glimpse of the wonderful complexity of\r\nthe mechanism of finance nor of the amazingly intricate organization\r\nof buying and selling. Who can blame them—they have never been told.\r\nI have kept a meeting of workmen keenly interested for an hour, after\r\nthe conclusion of some official business, in a simple explanation of\r\nthe functions played by finance in industry, and of the various kinds\r\nof financial operations entailed in the marketing of the product of\r\ntheir particular factory. Workmen respond to sympathetic education\r\nwith cheerful alacrity. One of the expedients to which the Department\r\nof Shipyard Labour resorted was the institution of talks with workmen\r\nin various ship-repairing districts of the rôles being played in the\r\nstirring circumstances of the times by naval and merchant ships which\r\nwere in dry-dock in local shipyards for reconditioning or repair. It had\r\na most stimulating effect; men found themselves no longer sluggishly\r\nworking upon an uninspiring metal hulk, but upon a living ship redolent\r\nwith stirring associations, engaged in performing for the nation\r\nfunctions and duties which they could readily understand. There was less\r\ntime lost, less sleeping on night-work, fewer stoppages of work; greater\r\nexpedition, larger output.\r\n\r\n\r\nMisconceptions as to Wages\r\n\r\nThe rate of wages is a matter ever present to the mind of the worker.\r\nIt is the question of most general discussion in normal times; but at\r\nall times there is a strange failure to appreciate the true facts of the\r\nposition. The average workman thought, before the war, that his employer\r\nwas always able to raise his rate of wages, if not to the particular\r\nlevel demanded, at any rate sufficiently to afford a substantial\r\nincrease, and that only the employer’s selfishness stood in the way\r\nof this being done. Such most certainly was the opinion generally\r\nentertained by Labour when, during the war, the State became virtually\r\nthe employer. Time after time bodies of workmen told me in perfect good\r\nfaith that there was no difficulty whatever in the Government paying the\r\nrate of wages which they claimed. It seemed to them wholly immaterial\r\nthat they were being paid, not out of the product of their work, but out\r\nof money borrowed by the State, with all the consequent inflation of\r\ncurrency and rise of prices. While, at the end of the war, many of the\r\nmore enlightened Labour leaders appreciated, and a few, whom I honour,\r\npublicly denounced, the futility of the mad race of wages after prices,\r\nthe average workman never was able to grasp it. There was a simple way,\r\nhe thought, of compensating him for increased prices—merely to raise\r\nwages. Much of our industrial trouble to-day is due to the spurious\r\nappearance of prosperity which was caused by the high nominal wages of\r\nthe war-period, and to the notion engendered in the mind of Labour that\r\nthe Government could now, by resorting once more to war-time methods of\r\ncontrolling industry, create the same prosperity as existed immediately\r\nafter the war. There is a foolish belief even among moderate men that the\r\nGovernment refrains from doing so in the interests of employers, in order\r\nto bring about a reduction of wages and a retrogression in conditions of\r\nemployment, and to weaken the power of the Trade Unions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscontent and its Causes\r\n\r\nOne who moves among the workers cannot fail to be struck with the\r\ndiscontent which permeates them. Some people call it “industrial unrest,”\r\nand condemn it as a menace to society; they forget that discontent\r\nwith existing conditions is an essential element of progress. Society\r\nadvances, not by uniform and rhythmic strides in a fixed direction, but\r\nby convulsive movements which, if plotted on a plan, would present the\r\nappearance of gyrations to right and left of the axis of progression,\r\nbut generally register a forward march. In our democratic organization\r\nof society, where the mutual relations of constituent elements of the\r\ncommunity are so generally governed by common-sense compromise, no\r\nsection that was passive could ever hope to better its social conditions.\r\n\r\nThere are several causes for the prevalent dissatisfaction, of which\r\nprobably the most potent is the increasing standard of education. Those\r\nwho take the trouble to compare the education of our industrial classes\r\nof to-day with the lack of education of the workers at the beginning\r\nof the nineteenth century, as described in some of the first Factory\r\nInspectors’ reports, cannot fail to realize what enormous progress has\r\nbeen achieved; and this progress has—and happily so—given birth to a new\r\nvision. One of the first effects of education is to stimulate aspirations\r\nfor improvement of material conditions, and the social observer generally\r\nfinds that the first aspirations created in this direction by education\r\nare frequently not kept within the bounds which a fuller education and a\r\nwider experience ultimately impose.\r\n\r\n\r\nEffect of Bad Environment\r\n\r\nAs, during the decades immediately before the war, the outlook of the\r\nworkers widened under the influence of education, and especially as a\r\nresult of the facilities for travel from the towns into the country for\r\nholidays and recreation, there has arisen an increasing dissatisfaction\r\nwith industrial surroundings and home conditions. Nor is that surprising.\r\nOwing to the aggregation of factories during the industrial revolution,\r\nas near as possible to the centre of towns, and the huddling of houses\r\nin crowded, fetid and ill-built courts, as near as possible to the\r\nfactories, a condition of things grew up, and indeed in many large towns\r\nstill continues, more than sufficient to cause industrial discontent.\r\nMen are told by Socialist proselytizers the plausible story that such a\r\nstate of things is one of the inevitable concomitants of the capitalistic\r\norganization of industry—a statement quite untrue. What caused it\r\nwas the impotence of municipal organization in those days to control\r\ntown planning or regulate the construction of streets and erection of\r\nhouses, and the insufficient development of the social conscience as to\r\nthe things which ought to be done for the good of the community. Some\r\nof our successful leaders of industry have conclusively demonstrated,\r\nby the most convincing of tests—viz., the commercial success of their\r\nventure—that there is no necessary connection whatsoever between bad\r\nindustrial environment and the prosperity of their “capitalistic”\r\nworks. Take for example Lord Leverhulme’s beautiful garden village at\r\nPort Sunlight, and many similar model villages connected with other\r\nindustrial undertakings. Nothing more conduces to industrial contentment\r\nthan a comfortable home; no one can expect contentment in the occupants\r\nof many of the old houses which still disgrace some of our industrial\r\ncentres, with their leaky roofs, rotten floors, muddy backyards and\r\ngeneral structural decay, in which it is impossible to keep things nice,\r\nor children tidy, or household effects clean. Our municipalities are\r\ndoing great work in sweeping away dwellings of this kind. Their final\r\ndisappearance is a matter of expense and rates, for removal is costly.\r\nLocal authorities are performing wonders in keeping, so far as they can,\r\nold buildings fit for human habitation, but there is a limit to the\r\nprocess of patching up ancient and dilapidated houses.\r\n\r\n\r\nFear of Unemployment\r\n\r\nAnother active cause of industrial discontent is insecurity of\r\nemployment. If this week a man is in work and has no certainty of work\r\nnext week—a condition even in normal times of large numbers of the\r\nindustrial population—he is persistently oppressed by a desolating\r\nfear. Want of work is the menacing spectre which haunts the background\r\nof every working-class home. Intermittent employment produces serious\r\ndecay of human fibres and moral degeneration—an inevitable result of the\r\ndiscouragement caused by fruitless seeking after work, and of the shifts\r\nto find food for wife and family. The inability to organize any uniform\r\nroutine of living leads straight away to improvidence: when a man is in\r\nwork one week, he spends all he has, relying on continuance of the work;\r\nnext week, if unemployed, he has nothing except perhaps some unemployment\r\npay or benefits. It is systematically rubbed into him by exponents\r\nof Socialism that unemployment is solely caused by the capitalistic\r\norganization of industry, that there can be none under the Socialists’\r\nregime, as if any socialistic scheme for the reorganization of industry\r\nis going to compel the consumer to buy more commodities and services than\r\nhe would be prepared, or able, to buy under capitalistic production.\r\n\r\n\r\nDissatisfaction with Status in Industry\r\n\r\nA contributing cause to industrial discontent of growing moment is\r\nwhat the worker describes as the denial to him of a human status in\r\nindustry. He complains, especially in the matter of being taken on or\r\ndischarged or put on overtime or night-work, indeed, with respect to\r\nthe whole conditions of his employment, that little or no regard is\r\npaid to him as a human being. He is content to accept the theory of the\r\nLabour intellectuals—it is certainly not his own conception—that he is\r\na wage-slave taken on and discharged just as it suits his employer’s\r\ninterests, and that his labour is bought and sold on the same principles\r\nas any other raw material in industry. The old paternal relation of\r\nemployer and employed, unfortunately much weakened by the introduction\r\nof the factory system, has undoubtedly disappeared with the conversion\r\nof family businesses into vast joint-stock company concerns; personal\r\ntouch between the master and his men no longer exists. There is, however,\r\nno ground for suggesting—as Socialists are fond of instilling into the\r\nminds of the workers—that this is still another inevitable result of\r\nthe capitalistic organization of industry. In some of the largest and\r\ngreatest of capitalistic works, workers can be, and to my knowledge are,\r\ntreated with consideration and sympathy. Their human values can always be\r\nrespected and full human status accorded to them if only the right spirit\r\nprevails between employers and employed, and proper machinery exists for\r\nits infusion into workshop life.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelief in Agitation\r\n\r\nDiscontent, expressed in constant agitation, has unfortunately been\r\nof practical value; that is one reason why it is so rife in industry\r\nto-day. No substantial increases in wages or improvement in working\r\nconditions have, in the past, been conceded voluntarily by employers, but\r\nonly after pressure by the Unions, subject, of course, to considerable\r\nqualifications in special cases. It is more or less inevitable that\r\nit should be so, having regard to the way in which the machinery of\r\ncollective bargaining has been operated by both sides. Every time, when\r\nan increase of wages, or an improvement in conditions is demanded and\r\nrefused, and then ultimately given under threat of a strike, it feeds\r\nthe springs of future discontent and confirms in the workers’ minds\r\nthe efficacy of agitation. In the latter days of the war the unsettled\r\ncondition of industry was largely due to the fact that in the earlier\r\ndays wage-increases had been refused and then conceded by the Government\r\nunder pressure of strikes and threats of stoppages by the workers. Each\r\ntime such capitulations took place it seriously ministered to the spirit\r\nof discontent.\r\n\r\n\r\nDesire for Improvement\r\n\r\nWhen one turns to other forces now commencing to pulsate through Labour,\r\none is impressed by the increasing general desire for mental and cultural\r\nimprovement, at times pathetic in its search for simple gratifications.\r\nSome persons scoff at this seeking after higher things by the\r\nworking-classes; their scorn is ill-timed, and their irony misdirected.\r\nThere is rapidly developing, I am glad to say, an increasing movement\r\nin this direction. Those engaged in social work in our great industrial\r\ncentres can testify to the innumerable ways in which this aspiration is\r\nfinding healthy expression.\r\n\r\nMore than one foreign observer has recorded his opinion that the\r\nstability of the British Constitution is materially due to the strong\r\nattachment to, and sentiment for, family life that prevail in this\r\ncountry. No member of the community is a stronger supporter of family\r\nlife than the British working-man; no one is prepared to make more\r\nsubstantial sacrifices for its maintenance and preservation, no one more\r\nfrequently has to make them. In this respect the British worker is one\r\nof the greatest living individualists, and the strength of his family\r\nindividualism will never let him be converted into a thoroughgoing\r\nCommunist. Theorists may talk to him till tired of working for the State\r\nand the community—I had to use that argument in war-time—he will answer\r\nthem, as I have been answered on the Clyde: “I work for the wife and\r\nbairns.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLow Conception of Work\r\n\r\nIn regard to his conception of work the British working-man is hopelessly\r\nwrong in his outlook. Some find pleasure in work; the manual worker is\r\nnot one of them. He has come to regard work as a species of thraldom,\r\ninstituted, not for his profit or improvement, but solely for the\r\nmaintenance of his employer and the swelling of his profits. This, of\r\ncourse, is merely a weak dilution of the Marxian fallacy. The modern\r\nmanual worker, because he has never been taught to look upon work as\r\na moral duty or upon industry as one of the highest forms of national\r\nservice, sees no dignity in work, and is sensible of no obligation\r\nincumbent on him to work to the best of his ability or even for the\r\nduration of the working day. The number of expedients to which I have\r\nknown manual workers resort—in other respects honest, upright men—in\r\norder to scamp the job, or cut time, would be perfectly surprising to\r\nthose not conversant with industry. To-day the moral obligation to work\r\nseems inverted into a duty to do as little as possible for the wages.\r\nSometimes the motive is to make the job last longer, at other times, to\r\nassist unemployment by making work go round, and, where remuneration is\r\nbased on payment by results, for less altruistic reasons, to force up\r\nthe prices paid for the job. But although the Marxian doctrine—that the\r\nmore work an employee does the more he contributes to the betrayal of\r\nhis brother workers by assisting the employer to amass illicit gains out\r\nof their exploitation—explains much of the work-shyness and “ca-canny”\r\nof to-day, there are other reasons. One is the extent to which work is\r\nsubdivided in modern factory organization. In an engineering shop, a job\r\ndone thirty or forty years ago by a skilled man on a general purpose\r\nmachine is now subdivided into a large number of constituent operations.\r\nThese will be performed by different workers on different semi-automatic\r\nmachines, and the finished part will be assembled by another set of\r\nworkers into the final product. In the old days the tradesman saw the\r\nfinished article gradually taking shape under his creative craftsmanship;\r\nto-day no worker sees anything but the single operation which he\r\nperforms. As a result, there is little to minister to the instincts\r\nof a craftsman. The workman employed on such repetition work becomes\r\nquickly apathetic, his interest relaxes, his inventiveness atrophies, his\r\ninitiative dies, he degenerates into a cog, and, being human, into an\r\ninefficient cog, in the vast mechanism of industry. These methods of mass\r\nproduction are quite inevitable in modern efficient practice, and the\r\nonly antidote is to encourage the workers to acquire a wider interest in\r\nindustry, and in the prosperity of the works in which they are employed,\r\nand to cultivate a spirit of culture so that their minds may be filled\r\nwith other things which satisfy their human aspirations, and replace the\r\nnoble satisfaction which a tradesman used to feel as the creation of his\r\nhandicraft grew beneath his skill.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuspicion of Employers\r\n\r\nIf asked what was the strongest sentiment I found permeating the\r\nworkshops, I should answer, suspicion of employers. In some districts it\r\nis worse than in others; in some works it is worse than in other works\r\nin the same district. Many reasons have been advanced for its existence,\r\nbut the real explanation is simple. Between the fifties and the eighties\r\nof last century, when the machinery of collective bargaining was coming\r\ninto operation, the principle of action adopted by many employers\r\nwas “enlightened self-interest”—the individualistic theory that an\r\nemployer best served his own interests, and, automatically by so doing\r\nthe best interests of the country, by furthering on all occasions his\r\nown advantage. To call this greed or selfishness is wrong. It implied\r\nno callous disregard of the rights of the workers, but it did involve\r\nsuch a bias of mind that the interests of employees were subordinated\r\nin the scheme of industry to those of the employers. In the course of\r\ncollective bargaining, of manœuvring for position, of higgling, many\r\nmanagements contracted the habit of seizing upon any circumstances\r\nwhich might enable them to cut piece-rates and time-allowances, bring\r\ndown wages, revise conditions of employment, and adopted the invariable\r\nattitude of resisting all the demands of their employees. Such employers\r\nhave disappeared, but “the evil that men do lives after them.” Not\r\nunnaturally, the workers learned to decipher some hostile motive\r\nbehind each action of their employer, however apparently beneficent,\r\nand regarded everything he did with unalloyed suspicion, and as calling\r\nfor the closest scrutiny. This is the cause of the want of confidence\r\nin the industrial atmosphere to-day. While it continues so charged with\r\nmistrust, confidence between all persons concerned in industry, which\r\nis necessary for production and essential for smooth running of the\r\nindustrial machine, can never flourish. All employers unreservedly now\r\ndeprecate this unhappy condition of things, many have gone to exceptional\r\ntrouble to dissipate the blight on industry of such distrust, but\r\nmemories are long, industrial prejudices tenacious, and it will take time\r\nand much effort to forge a bond of trust.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Worker and his Trade Union\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the British worker to his Trade Union reflects the\r\nBritish temperament. Abroad one sees the workers follow their Unions in\r\nmatters both industrial and political; in this country there is no such\r\ngeneral surrender of individual judgment. So far as industrial questions\r\nare concerned, with the exception of some smaller Unions whose members\r\nseem always in a seething condition of revolt, and certain revolutionary\r\nelements in some of the great Unions, the majority of Trade Unionists\r\nwill follow their own Union leaders. That, however, is a very different\r\nthing from following the general lead of the combined Trade Unions as\r\nexpressed through the Trades Union Congress or the Labour Party. As one\r\nresult of the craft organization of industry in this country, which at\r\ntimes during the war showed signs of disintegration but now seems more\r\nfirmly established than ever, the Unions are almost as suspicious of\r\none another’s motives—a result of the fear of one trade invading the\r\nother’s work—as Labour in the mass is suspicious of the employers. Where,\r\nhowever, a question is, rightly or wrongly, represented to involve a\r\nprinciple directly affecting the common interests of all workers, the\r\nTrade Unionist has been so well drilled in the virtue of solidarity that\r\nhe will, generally, range himself under the banner of organized Labour.\r\nIn regard to political matters there is no such docility, although\r\ncompelled to contribute to his Union’s political fund. To-day he is\r\nforced to do so, in spite of his power to object under the Trade Union\r\nAct 1913; if the Trade Union Act (1913) Amendment Bill 1922 passes,\r\nhe will not be liable unless he expressly agrees. There is evidence\r\nof independence in the results of the General Election in 1918 and of\r\nby-elections since, where very large sections of the workers have\r\nvoted, not for the official Labour candidate, but for the candidate of\r\nanother political party opposing Labour. This fact undoubtedly explains\r\nthe strenuous efforts of the Labour Party to formulate a composite\r\npolitical programme which will appear to its Trade Unionist members as an\r\nindustrial programme, and to non-industrial supporters as one primarily\r\nof a social character.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Worker and the Community\r\n\r\nThe worker’s conception of himself in relation to the community invites\r\na comment. As a substitute for a convincing argument that the interests\r\nof the worker are entirely separate from, and opposed to, those of the\r\nrest of the community organized on a capitalistic basis, the worker\r\nhas been assiduously encouraged to develop his “class-consciousness.”\r\nIf by any process of auto-suggestion he can convince himself that what\r\ntends to promote the general common weal does not tend to further the\r\ninterests of Labour, but generally runs counter to them, he may more\r\nsurely be relied on to adopt an attitude of militant antagonism to\r\ncontinuance of the present organization of industry and society. The\r\nefforts of extremists are continually directed to foment this feeling\r\nof class-consciousness until it culminates in class-warfare. I have had\r\nwide opportunities for gauging the prevalence and depth of the sentiment,\r\nand though one found it in active operation among certain groups of\r\nmen on the Clyde, in Barrow, on the Mersey, and in a few other centres\r\nof advanced industrial thought, I never encountered much of it amongst\r\nthe general body of working-men. They do not accept the proposition\r\nthat they stand, as beings apart, in a separate category from the rest\r\nof the community. Indeed, in the latter days of the war, many Unions,\r\nrecognizing the interests of their members as consumers rather than as\r\nproducers, abandoned the policy of increasing wages and strongly urged\r\nthe regulation of prices instead, so much did the circumstances of\r\nconsumption affecting their members as citizens exceed in importance\r\nmatters touching their special interests as workers.\r\n\r\nOne may carry this a stage further. In spite of the ranting of extremists\r\nthat the war was an effort of capitalists to advance their own financial\r\nends, and utterly inimical to the interests of the workers, Labour in\r\nthis country stood shoulder to shoulder with the rest of the community\r\nand willingly underwent the greatest sacrifices both in the matter of\r\nmilitary service and in regard to the suspension of Trade Union rights\r\nand customs. Had the Government at the beginning of the war courageously\r\nconscribed every person for national service, many galling disparities\r\nwould never have arisen, and gross inequalities of sacrifice would have\r\nbeen forestalled, the aggravation of which, towards the end of the war,\r\nand not without justification, upset the equanimity of the workers and\r\ncaused serious industrial upheavals. It should never be forgotten that in\r\nthe early days of the war universal national service was strongly urged\r\nby prominent Labour leaders, but was killed by the cries of “Business as\r\nusual,” for which members of the Government were alone responsible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nREFORM OF INDUSTRY INSTEAD OF SOCIALIZATION\r\n\r\n    The Three Dominant Aspirations of the Workers—Can and Ought\r\n    they to be Satisfied?—The Vagueness of Labour’s Scheme of\r\n    Reconstruction—The Recent Change in Labour’s Proposals—Reform\r\n    of Industry _v._ Reconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Three Dominant Aspirations of the Workers\r\n\r\nThe organization of industry cannot continue in its present state of\r\ninstability; something must be done. The Socialist who would reconstruct\r\nindustry, the anti-Socialist who would reform it, each assumes it to be\r\nnecessary to satisfy aspirations of the workers that are not satisfied\r\nunder conditions as they exist to-day. The three greatest aspirations\r\nanimating the workers are, in their order of relative importance: first,\r\nremoval of the ever-present menace of unemployment; secondly, recognition\r\nin industry of the worker’s human status; thirdly, distribution, as of\r\nmoral right, of an equitable share of the product. Talk, as I did during\r\nthe war on over three thousand occasions, to the ordinary working-man,\r\nthose are the three basic sentiments you find swaying him. All the\r\nintricate schemes for reconstruction of industry which the fertile\r\nand fervid imaginations of the Labour intellectuals have evolved are\r\nlargely unintelligible to him, and leave him unmoved and cold. He cares\r\nnothing about the delicate and subtle regimentation of industry and\r\nsociety as Guild Socialists would have it; he wholly fails to grasp,\r\nindeed, is acutely suspicious of, a Socialist commonwealth constructed\r\nand controlled on a vocational or functional basis. The test which he\r\napplies to such complex and conjectural conceptions is their efficacy in\r\nsatisfying those three great fundamental aspirations. But that is too\r\nrestricted a purview for an aspirant political party, and was astutely\r\ndeclared by the old parliamentary hands of the Labour movement to\r\nconstitute too narrow a class-basis to support a popular appeal. Hence it\r\nwas that all the non-industrial doctrinaires—and there are many of them\r\nattached to the Labour Party—were set to work to compile a new Social\r\nContract. Scores of pamphlets have now been published descriptive of the\r\npolicy of the Party on every conceivable topic—political, administrative,\r\njudicial, local government, social, and industrial—national, imperial and\r\ninternational. If formulation on paper of ideals of humanitarianism, and\r\nquixotic Utopianism, without any consideration of cost or practicability,\r\nis statesmanship, the Labour Party’s policy is truly admirable. It\r\noutlines in glowing splendour a wonderful new mechanism of politics,\r\nsociety and industry, in which every exterior part falls into place with\r\nthe smoothness and precision of a model engine constructed out of a box\r\nof parts—but, like the toy, with no works inside. That this mysterious\r\nmechanism may provide in some subtle and not very obvious way, the means\r\nof securing the three fundamentals is its only recommendation in the eyes\r\nof the great mass of Labour.\r\n\r\nIf it is right to assume that the ordinary worker’s dominant desire is\r\nto obtain reasonable satisfaction of these three aspirations, and of\r\nthe soundness of that assumption I entertain no doubt, for at my three\r\nthousand odd conferences and meetings with Labour during the war—at all\r\nof which accurate notes were taken of the subjects of discussion—these\r\nwere the three foremost topics, two questions arise: Are these three\r\naspirations proper ones to be satisfied? If so, how can they best be\r\nsatisfied with due regard to the interests of the community?\r\n\r\n\r\nCan and Ought they to be Satisfied?\r\n\r\nThere is in regard to unemployment but little difficulty in coming to a\r\nsound conclusion. Unemployment, and to a less extent under-employment,\r\nis on every ground—humanitarian, social, economic—a curse so great\r\nthat no reasonable effort should be spared to reduce to a minimum the\r\nprobability of its occurrence, and to mitigate as far as possible its\r\ndire effects when once it has supervened. Many will differ as to how\r\nfar it is right to go in the provision of measures of alleviation, but\r\nthat is a difference more in degree than in principle. In regard to the\r\ninvestiture of every worker in industry with “human status” there is a\r\nmore radical cleavage in opinion. While few employers will contest the\r\nright of the workmen through their constitutional representatives to\r\nvoice their demands for settling wages and conditions of employment,\r\nand such demands—backed up by the power to apply economic pressure—are\r\neffectively voiced by the Trade Unions, most employers will deny the\r\nright of the workers “to interfere in the management.” It would be quite\r\nimpossible to have two sets of persons attempting to manage a factory,\r\nor to direct the conduct of the business on the commercial side. But\r\nbetween the fixing of wages and conditions of employment, in which\r\nit is admitted that Labour should have a real voice, and the actual\r\nexecutive direction of a business in which it is clear that Labour could\r\nnot exercise a voice, if efficiency is to be preserved and discipline\r\nremain unimpaired, there is a wide sphere of matters which are proper\r\nto be discussed between employers and representatives of the workers,\r\nand which, when discussed and settled, can be left for executive action\r\nto the employers. There is ample room for compromise. The confusion\r\nsurrounding the catchwords of “a voice in conditions,” “interference in\r\nthe management,” wants to be cleared away before any more harm is done.\r\n\r\nOn the question of remuneration there is really, if the matter be closely\r\nexamined, no difference whatever in principle. Most employers agree with\r\nthe unions that the worker is entitled to a fair share of the product;\r\nthey disagree as to what proportion of the product constitutes a fair\r\nshare—a dispute not as to principle but as to quantum. No employer, so\r\nfar as my experience goes, would contend that he was entitled in good\r\ntimes to pay his workers nothing more than a bare subsistence wage,\r\nand appropriate for himself as profit all the balance of revenue after\r\npayment of working expenses and the market rate on capital. What usually\r\nhappens in bad times is that the workers in employment get, as a first\r\ncharge on the product, wages much higher than subsistence rates, and the\r\nshareholders go without return, which results in great deprivation to\r\nmany whose meagre incomes consist of such dividends. The more critically\r\none examines the three fundamentals the more one is irresistibly driven\r\nto the conclusion that there are no issues between employers and the\r\nworkers in regard to any of them which cannot form the subject of fair\r\ncollective bargaining. But that is what is denied by the intellectuals of\r\nthe Labour Party, entirely on their own a priori reasons. Happily their\r\ndoctrinaire conclusions meet with scant respect from the general body of\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vagueness of Labour’s Scheme of Reconstruction\r\n\r\nThere are only two possible courses for the future—either to reconstruct\r\nindustry on some entirely new basis, or to maintain the present\r\nsystem of organization and introduce reforms which will cover the\r\nthree fundamentals as a first beginning. That really is the question\r\non which a decision must sooner or later be taken by the nation, and\r\nfar-reaching national consequences will turn upon it. Labour says:\r\n“Destroy the present industrial system, and replace it by something\r\nbased on public, and not private, ownership of the means of production.”\r\nDid we know exactly what Labour’s scheme of reconstruction is, it could\r\nbe critically examined in detail, and its practical effect on the\r\nprosperity of industry, the welfare of the worker and the good of the\r\ncommunity dispassionately considered. But Labour with prudent reticence\r\nhas not provided us with any official scheme. Different sections of\r\nLabour have tabled all kinds of variant and in many cases discordant\r\nschemes which agree in one respect only—the elimination of the private\r\nemployer. All that the Labour Party tender in the way of constructive\r\nreorganization is the vague formula of “nationalization and democratic\r\ncontrol,” Nor will the Party undertake to say what is the method and kind\r\nof industrial control—a matter on which depend the whole efficiency and\r\nsuccess of industry—which it has in mind. The truth is, the Party has not\r\nsucceeded in devising any scheme of industrial control on which it can\r\nagree, and the Executive Committee, though instructed to report on that\r\nquestion, has either been unable to do so, or have found it expedient to\r\npostpone committing itself (_see_ p. 58). Yet the Party, after invoking\r\nfire from Heaven on the Government as retribution for its policy of\r\nopportunism in regard to industry, calls upon the country to witness\r\nthat Labour has a considered and well-thought-out industrial policy,\r\nwhich it euphemistically calls “democratic control,” and announces with\r\ningenuous _naïveté_ that it is such a system as will always harmonize\r\nwith the special circumstances and requirements of each industry! Who\r\nis the opportunist? The Government in adhering to continuance of the\r\nestablished organization of industry—on which the greatness of England’s\r\ntrade and commerce has been built up—or the Labour Party, which, without\r\nany clear idea of what it would put in its place, would destroy the\r\nexisting organization in the complacent expectation that by some process\r\nof abiogenesis a better system will soar like the Phoenix from the ashes?\r\nThere would be a short and sharp retort from the members of any of the\r\ngreat Trade Unions, for example the Amalgamated Engineering Union, were\r\nthe Labour Party to propose to reconstruct that proud organization on\r\nthe basis of a resounding formula. The Executive Committee of that\r\nUnion—supposing it, agreed to consider any such gratuitous suggestion\r\nfrom even a Labour source—would insist—at least it always did with me\r\nduring the war—that general phrases should be reduced into clear, crisp\r\nand definite proposals, each one of which could be subjected to a\r\nmicroscopic scrutiny of the most searching kind, sufficient to reveal\r\nits true nature, its effects direct and indirect, and its remotest\r\nimplications. Is not the nation entitled to similar information? In\r\nPart I, chapter IX, I outline the injury to industry and the country\r\nthat would inevitably result, in my judgment, from any socialistic\r\nreconstruction of industry. Here I am only concerned to show that when\r\nthe flowing garments of flowery phraseology are respectfully removed,\r\nthey are seen to cover nothing but a hollow lay-figure without the least\r\nsemblance to even an articulated model. This is what we are invited by\r\nthe Labour Party to set up and worship as the future genius of British\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Recent Change in Labour’s Proposals\r\n\r\nLabour has started from the wrong end—not to ascertain what are the\r\ndefects in the present industrial system and the manner in which they\r\ncan best be remedied—but how to get rid most easily of the private\r\nemployer under the honest but uncritical and irrational belief that\r\nunless he is removed the defects cannot be remedied. This was the\r\nnotion of Labour in the days when first it embraced State Socialism.\r\nNationalization of industries, under which the Government would replace\r\nthe private employer, was described in radiant language as “the\r\ncharter of salvation of the working-classes.” Then Labour acquired\r\nsome experience of the State as a “model employer”—in the Post Office,\r\nin the Royal Dockyards, in Woolwich Arsenal, and in other Government\r\nfactories. With the disappearance of the private employer the workers\r\nin such nationalized industries found to their surprise and clamant\r\nregret that their conditions were not better, but were worse. The\r\nState, they discovered, was not so considerate a master as the private\r\nemployer—not so disposed to recognize Trade Unions, or introduce Trade\r\nUnion conditions, or pay standard rates of wages. Was ever a complacently\r\ncherished conviction so rudely shattered! Any critical inquirer would\r\nhave stopped to consider whether after all it was right, with this\r\npractical experience, to assume that the only way to improve industrial\r\nconditions was to put an end to the private employer. Some prominent\r\nTrade Unionists did pause to think, and more than one has told me of\r\nhis consequent renunciation of Socialism. So the old doctrine died,\r\nand some other doctrine was urgently needed—a fitting opportunity for\r\nthe intellectuals. A new ship had to be constructed on the old keel of\r\nthe abolition of private ownership, and this time it had to float. And\r\nafter all, was anything easier? It had become fashionable, during the\r\nwar, to talk of the rigidity of bureaucracy, and the inelasticity of\r\nbureaucratic direction—precisely the same thing might have been said\r\nwith equal justice about the Trade Unions, for they are bureaucracy _in\r\nexcelsis_—but no one thought of it. On the other hand, men’s ears were\r\ndinned with the mobile excellencies of democracy, its extraordinary\r\nversatility in adjusting men to their environment, and in modulating\r\nthe qualities of the latter to its human content, and the air vibrated\r\nwith theories of political self-determination. Democratic Government was\r\nbeing hailed as the balm for Europe, and what was more natural than that\r\nindustrial self-determination under the name of “democratic control”\r\nshould be acclaimed by Labour as the restorative of industry. So the new\r\nship was built and called “Nationalization and Democratic Control.” Put\r\ninto the water in 1918, it still lies a mere hull, unengined, unfinished\r\nand unclassed.\r\n\r\nBut taught by war-time experience, the Labour Party has become more\r\ncautious. It no longer contends as it used to do that all industries\r\ncan be nationalized—an admission, the importance of which should not be\r\noverlooked. It would nationalize and democratically control only some\r\nof the great national industries, the smaller and less well-organized\r\nindustries it will leave, for the present, alone. It even goes so far as\r\nto admit the economic necessity for the continuance of many middlemen.\r\nThe industries that it would nationalize are those that were small\r\nand badly organized once, but which responded to the enterprise and\r\ninitiative of the pioneers who made them and so grew great. This, when\r\nstripped of dialectics, means that Labour is satisfied that its regime of\r\nnationalization and democratic control whatever else it can achieve—and\r\nas to that we are left to speculate—cannot supply the enterprise and\r\ninitiative requisite for the development of budding industries. At what\r\nstage in the growth of an industry Labour’s machinery of nationalization\r\nand democratic control can step in and infuse those two great qualities\r\nwhich are essential for vitality and progress, at a voltage higher than\r\ncan be generated under private ownership, no information whatsoever is\r\nvouchsafed to us.\r\n\r\nThose who have studied with a critical eye the official details of\r\nLabour’s industrial policy in chapter VIII, will have noted that the\r\nsame veil of indefiniteness enshrouds the practical working out of\r\n“nationalization and democratic control.” Is it to mean an increased\r\nfinancial burden on the State? No details. How is the requisite capital\r\nto be procured when we have performed the national obsequies over the\r\nprivate capitalist? No details, except that it will be derived from a\r\nmythical “national surplus” which now, at any rate, does not exist. By\r\nwhat means are the waste and inefficiency which experience has shown to\r\nbe inherent in bureaucratically administered industries to be obviated?\r\nNo details. What is the mechanism which is going to compel the home\r\nconsumer to increase his consumption and the foreign consumer to buy\r\ncommodities which he will not, and cannot, buy to-day? No information.\r\nWhere will the secret fund be situated, and how is it to be formed, which\r\nis going to finance higher wages and better conditions than under the\r\npresent scheme of industrial organization? We are not informed—that it\r\ncannot be built up from employers’ profits is clear from chapter XXVI.\r\nFor the answers to these practical questions of crucial importance,\r\nand to many others, we are left groping in the dark. All we are told\r\nis that learned intellectuals of the Labour Party, out of their wealth\r\nof industrial research and ample gifts of prescience, when the proper\r\ntime comes, will open their Pandora’s box and reveal the secrets. Is the\r\nnation prepared to gamble its existence on that assurance?\r\n\r\n\r\nReform of Industry _v._ Reconstruction\r\n\r\nHappily for the country, the ordinary worker is no more intrigued with\r\nthe intellectuals’ proposals for the reconstruction of industry, or\r\nsociety or the State than he is with their schemes for the reconstitution\r\nof his Trade Union, all of which he has with contumely turned down.\r\nWhat he is most keenly interested in is whether their proposals are\r\nthe soundest, safest and quickest way to afford him relief against\r\nunemployment, and give him a human status in industry and a fair share\r\nin the product. He has not at all accepted the Labour Party’s portentous\r\ndeclaration that nothing short of “nationalization and democratic\r\ncontrol” can confer those benefits.\r\n\r\nLet us then start from the ordinary workers’ standpoint. It is fair,\r\nit is commonsense, it is characteristically practical. We can say to\r\nthem with absolute fairness that what Labour is asking the country to\r\ndo is to take a jump into the unknown, and for the existing industrial\r\nsystem with which we are familiar, and which is always capable of\r\nimprovement—for that is an uncontrovertible fact proved by our past\r\nindustrial history—to substitute a new industrial system of which we\r\nhave no experience, of the practical operation and effects of which\r\nnothing whatever is ascertainable, a venture which is subject to risks\r\nso grave and possibilities so disastrous as to endanger the whole\r\nindustrial and commercial prosperity of this country. We can then offer\r\nthe workers an alternative scheme which, while reforming the fundamental\r\ndefects that at present exist in our industrial system, will not alter\r\nits basic principles. Unless the psychology of the worker undergoes some\r\ncataclysmic change, what he will say is: “Take your scheme of reform, if\r\nit deals fairly with unemployment, my human status in industry and my\r\nshare of the product, it will serve as a beginning.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS TO BE RECTIFIED IN INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n    Capital and the Administrative Staff—Capital and the Manual\r\n    Workers—The Manual Workers _inter se_—The Administrative\r\n    Staff and the Manual Workers—Industry and the Consuming\r\n    Community—Industry and the Nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we can construct any scheme of reform of our industrial system we\r\nmust have a clear idea of what is industry. In the prosaic language of\r\neconomics it is a purposive production of commodities and services, the\r\nimmediate object of those engaged in it being to provide, through the\r\nresult of their work, the material means of satisfying their wants and\r\ndesires.\r\n\r\nViewed in broad outline, industry will be seen to involve three\r\nfundamental processes:\r\n\r\n(i) The combination in due proportion of the five things requisite for\r\nall production, viz., capital, enterprise, organization, labour—both hand\r\nand brain—and natural forces and resources.\r\n\r\n(ii) The realisation of the product—industrial work is nowadays useless\r\nunless and until the product is marketed. The amount realized depends\r\nmainly on the public demand for the product, and invariably the cheaper\r\nthe selling price, the greater is the demand.\r\n\r\n(iii) The division of the realized surplus amongst those associated in\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nFurther, it will also be observed that industry necessarily involves six\r\nfundamental human relationships, the importance of which has been much\r\nneglected in the past.\r\n\r\n1. _The Industrial_, i.e. between the classes of persons associated\r\ntogether in industry:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Capital and the Administrative Staff.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Capital and the Manual Workers.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The Administrative Staff and the Manual Workers.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Manual Workers between themselves.\r\n\r\n2. _The Social_—between industry and the community.\r\n\r\n3. _The National_—between industry and the nation. These relationships\r\nare of paramount importance. The individual is no longer the unit—in\r\nthings industrial, it is the group of those associated in production—in\r\nthings social, it is the community—in things national, the whole people.\r\nEach small group is included in, and directly reacts on, a larger group.\r\nLabour, in its _Official Policy for Reconstruction after the War_, truly\r\nsays: “We are members one of another. No man liveth to himself alone. If\r\nany, even the humblest, is made to suffer, the whole community and every\r\none of us, whether or not we recognize the fact, is thereby injured.” How\r\nfrequently Labour forgets its own irrefutable proposition! The problem\r\nthen is so to organize the processes of industry and harmonize the human\r\nrelationships involved in it, that to the utmost practicable extent\r\nproductive efficiency will be secured, the human qualities of all those\r\nassociated in industry recognized, their capacities fully developed and\r\nutilized, their aspirations satisfied, and their respective services\r\nco-ordinated to promote the benefit and happiness of all of them, the\r\ngood of the community, and the welfare of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital and the Administrative Staff\r\n\r\nLet us first examine the relationship between Capital and the\r\nAdministrative Staff. In the Administrative Staff, I include every one\r\nfrom the managing director down to the gate-keeper. They are the brains\r\nand mechanism of the organization and management, the connecting link\r\nbetween Capital and Labour. The success of an employer’s business is\r\ndependent on their tact, judgment, and power of governing men, but\r\nCapital has not yet risen to that conception. It has not conceded to the\r\nAdministrative Staff a status commensurate with their enormous private\r\nand public responsibilities, nor, except at the very top, adequate\r\nfinancial recognition. The art of managing men so as to get the best out\r\nof them and secure their cordial co-operation, is generally considered\r\nby Capital to be a customary by-product of technical ability. In truth,\r\nit is a special qualification requiring its own special training,\r\nexceptional attributes of mind and temperament, and particular fibres of\r\ncharacter, of the possession of which technical ability is no criterion\r\nwhatsoever. If industry is to progress, Capital must elevate its\r\nconception of the duties of the Administrative Staff and recognize that\r\nadministration, even in its lowest branches, is work as skilled as that\r\nof an expert craftsman.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital and the Manual Workers\r\n\r\nWe must next scrutinize the basic industrial relationship between Capital\r\nand the Manual Workers. Permeating it, we find, as the result of the\r\ncauses already mentioned, seething discontent and active antagonism—not\r\ncordiality—not mutual confidence, but unreasoning distrust. We see on\r\nboth sides black suspicion twisting the motive behind every action, and\r\nthe task is to create contentment among the workers, and enlist their\r\nhearty co-operation with employers in the process of production.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Manual Workers _inter se_\r\n\r\nThe Manual Workers are far from being a happy family. In this country\r\nall work in every industry is allocated by tradition or Trade Union\r\nagreement to this trade or that trade as its sacrosanct preserve. Woe\r\nbetide an unskilled man who invades the industrial territory of a\r\ntradesman! These rigid lines of demarcation of work are the cause of\r\nuntold industrial friction and operate most detrimentally to prevent an\r\nemployer introducing modern methods or installing time- and labour-saving\r\nappliances. There is no greater need in industry than for a peace-treaty\r\nbetween the warring Trade Unions under which this system of dividing work\r\ninto so many water-tight compartments will be modified.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Administrative Staff and the Manual Workers\r\n\r\nThe Administrative Staff has not yet attained to a true conception\r\nof their great part in industry. I often found that, so far as their\r\nrelationship to Labour is concerned, they are inclined to regard their\r\ngeneral functions as solely to maintain discipline. The preservation of\r\nrobust discipline is a vital matter. Too often discipline is bolstered\r\nup by arbitrary and dictatorial methods, to which means weak men usually\r\nhave recourse. That, if not productive of immediate friction, certainly\r\nsows broadcast the seeds of trouble and unrest. The vital matter,\r\nthe atmosphere of the shop, is mainly dependent on the conciliatory\r\npersonalities of the Administrative Staff. What has to be remembered in\r\nindustry is that despotism is not leadership, and arbitrariness is not\r\ngood government. “The moral effects of good leadership,” as Professor\r\nMcDougall truly says in _The Group Mind_, “work throughout a mass of men\r\nby subtle processes of suggestion and emotional contagion rather than\r\nby a process of purely intellectual appreciation.” This many employers\r\nhave yet to learn; they regard courtesy on the part of the Administrative\r\nStaff in dealing with Labour as cowardice, and consideration as\r\nsubversive of good discipline. But consideration is the oil which makes\r\nshop wheels go round, and there never was more scope for its application\r\nin industry than at the present time, especially in such things as\r\ninterviewing, selecting and taking on, promoting and dismissing men, and\r\ndealing with shop complaints.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndustry and the Consuming Community\r\n\r\nIndustry as a whole does not appreciate the close relationship between\r\nitself and the community, nor its responsibilities to the community. In\r\nreality industry has to rely on the community for innumerable services,\r\nand for many facilities vital to its existence, and to its prosperity,\r\nand for a market for its product. Yet almost invariably strikes and\r\nlock-outs are called, regardless of the effect upon the consuming public.\r\nIn fact, Labour claims the right to use its economic power in furtherance\r\nof its own interests, irrespective of the damage to the community. If,\r\nunder compelling necessity, the community attempts to carry on the\r\nservices for itself, or provide the commodities of which by organized\r\nstrikes it is deprived, it is charged with anti-social conduct, and\r\ncondemned for declaring a class-war against Labour, those who assist\r\nbeing stigmatized as strike-breakers and black-legs. Labour has gone even\r\nfurther in recent years. In a number of cases it has deliberately adopted\r\nthe policy of depriving the community of essential services through\r\nstrikes, in order to produce such social hardship as will drive the\r\ncommunity to constrain employers to accept Labour’s industrial demands.\r\nThere have also been recent instances of agreements between employers\r\nand Trade Unions—as in the building industry—by which wages have been\r\nforced up to unreasonably high rates simply because those industries\r\nwere necessary to the community and, with the knowledge that whatever\r\nthe resulting cost of the product might be, the community would have to\r\npay. At the same time, the community is largely dependent upon industry,\r\nand if the whole of an industry, or each section of it, fulfils its\r\nobligations to the community, the community must perform certain duties\r\nin return. I speak more fully of these later.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndustry and the Nation\r\n\r\nIndustry will never progress to vigorous and healthy development unless\r\nour conception of the relationship between industry and the nation is\r\nradically revised. That conception to-day is mean, stunted, and utterly\r\ndevoid of any power of inspiration. Industry I have defined, in the\r\nlanguage of economics, as the production of commodities and services\r\nfor the purpose of satisfying the wants and desires of men. On this\r\ncommonplace process, which sounds so dull in definition, and on none\r\nother, the future well-being of our country and the practicability\r\nof further social improvements and reforms depend. Production ought,\r\ntherefore, to be regarded as the principal means of advancing the\r\nhappiness, social welfare and material prosperity of the nation, and\r\nindustry, the chief instrument in that beneficent work, as the highest\r\nand the noblest form of national service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHT RELATIONSHIP OF GOVERNMENT TO INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n    1. The Policy for the Present Depression—Establishment of\r\n    International Peace—Reduction of National Expenditure—Lowering\r\n    of Taxation—Stabilizing the Exchanges—Revision of Financial\r\n    Policy—Reconsideration of Reparations Policy—Inter-Allies\r\n    Debts—Export Credits—Bringing down Costs of Production.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn approaching the formulation of a national industrial policy, we must\r\nfirst determine the proper relationship of the Government to industry.\r\nThat involves consideration of what special action the Government can,\r\nand should, take in these exceptional times of abnormal trade depression\r\nto assist the restoration of industry, and of the position in which the\r\nGovernment should stand to industry in normal times.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE POLICY FOR THE PRESENT DEPRESSION\r\n\r\nThe present depression in trade and decline in industry are primarily due\r\nto the world-war. The causes are not clearly appreciated by the general\r\npublic; they are international as well as national, and call for action\r\nabroad as insistently as for remedies at home.\r\n\r\nThe causes are: first, a definite lack of demand from foreign markets for\r\ncommodities of which this country was, before the war, a producer. It\r\nwas customary, until recently, to hear it said that the countries of the\r\nworld are crying out for our goods. That is not an accurate statement. A\r\nvery considerable proportion of the foreign markets, open to this country\r\nbefore the war, has now, for the time being at any rate, definitely\r\ndisappeared. I have had opportunities of discussing this question\r\nwith foreign business men who have special knowledge of continental\r\nconditions. All were definite as to this want of demand; the explanation\r\nthey said was simple—the devastation resulting from the war and the\r\nabsence of settled and stable government. They described the most amazing\r\nexpedients and contrivances to which resort is made in foreign countries\r\nin order to avoid the purchase of what in normal times would be\r\nordinary trade machinery and equipment. Then next comes the inability of\r\ncontinental countries to produce commodities which—to use the compendious\r\nphrase in economics—they require to exchange for commodities from other\r\ncountries, either because their mechanism of production is rusted or\r\nruined as the result of the war, and they have not capital to renew it,\r\nor from inability to buy from abroad because of impoverishment resulting\r\nfrom the war, or the adverse balance of exchange against them. When one\r\nturns to this country, we see British manufacturers unable to sell to\r\ncustomers in many continental countries because of the uncertain credit\r\nof the foreign buyer, and, where credit is sufficiently satisfactory,\r\nor constitutes an insurable risk, because of the sharp variations in\r\nexchange. A manufacturer in this country may be in a position to do firm\r\nbusiness with a foreign buyer at a given rate of exchange which is just\r\nsufficient to ensure a small percentage of profit; a violent fluctuation\r\nin the exchange at the time payment is effected may entirely eliminate\r\nall profit and possibly convert it into a serious loss. Then again, the\r\nhigh cost of production in this country, especially of manufactured\r\ncommodities where the wages of labour form 60-85 per cent. of the total\r\ncost of production, makes it impossible for the British manufacturer to\r\nsell sufficiently cheaply abroad, especially in the face of competition\r\nof similar goods produced in countries with a depreciated currency which\r\nstands at an external value much below its internal value. In addition,\r\nsome countries to which we have lent money, and which pay us no interest\r\nthereon, are erecting heavy tariff barriers against us, and by subsidies\r\nand restrictions on coastwise trade and emigration are injuring seriously\r\nBritish shipping and trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstablishment of International Peace\r\n\r\nInternational trade implies mutual dependence. If one country goes out\r\nof business it injures all other countries, even those that never traded\r\ndirectly with it. Trade must languish in countries where conditions are\r\nunsettled. It should be the first aim of the Government in concert with\r\nits Allies to establish peace generally throughout the world. That has\r\nbeen authoritatively declared. In accordance with arrangements made\r\nby the Council of the League of Nations, an International Financial\r\nConference was convened at Brussels on September 24, 1920. The duty\r\nentrusted by the Council to the Conference was to study the international\r\nfinancial crisis and seek for means of remedying it and of mitigating the\r\ndangerous consequences arising from it, subject to the provision that\r\nno matter included in the then pending negotiations between the Allies\r\nand Germany should be discussed. There were eighty-six members at the\r\nConference, representing thirty-nine different countries.\r\n\r\nAs the chief essential for the recuperation of industry and the revival\r\nof trade, the Conference insisted on the establishment of a real, as\r\ndistinct from a paper, peace:\r\n\r\n    “First and foremost the world needs peace. The Conference\r\n    affirms most emphatically that the first condition for the\r\n    world’s recovery is the restoration of real peace, the\r\n    conclusion of wars which are still being waged and the assured\r\n    maintenance of peace for the future. The continuance of the\r\n    atmosphere of war and of preparations for war is fatal to the\r\n    development of that mutual trust which is essential to the\r\n    resumption of normal trading relations. The world must resolve\r\n    the rivalries and animosities which have been the inevitable\r\n    legacy of the struggle by which Europe has been torn.”\r\n\r\n    “The security of internal conditions is scarcely less\r\n    important, as foreign trade cannot prosper in a country whose\r\n    internal conditions do not inspire confidence. The Conference\r\n    trusts that the League of Nations will lose no opportunity to\r\n    secure the full restoration and continued maintenance of peace.”\r\n\r\n    “The Conference affirms that the improvement of the financial\r\n    position largely depends on the general restoration as soon\r\n    as possible of goodwill between the various nations; and\r\n    in particular it endorses the declaration of the Supreme\r\n    Council of March 8, 1920, ‘that the States which have been\r\n    created or enlarged as a result of the war should at once\r\n    re-establish full and friendly co-operation, and arrange for\r\n    the unrestricted interchange of commodities in order that the\r\n    essential unity of European economic life may not be impaired\r\n    by the erection of artificial economic barriers.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nReduction of National Expenditure\r\n\r\nIf trade is to be resuscitated, there must be a ruthless curtailment of\r\nnational expenditure, an inflexible renunciation of everything resulting\r\nin expense which is not absolutely essential to present national\r\nexistence. On this question the Financial Conference spoke clearly:\r\n\r\n    “The statements presented to the Conference show that, on an\r\n    average, some 20 per cent. of the national expenditure is\r\n    still being devoted to the maintenance of armaments and to\r\n    preparations for war. The Conference desires to affirm with the\r\n    utmost emphasis that the world cannot afford this expenditure.\r\n    Only by a frank policy of mutual co-operation can the nations\r\n    hope to regain their old prosperity, and to secure that result\r\n    the whole resources of each country must be devoted to strictly\r\n    productive purposes. The Conference accordingly recommends\r\n    most earnestly to the Council of the League of Nations the\r\n    desirability of conferring at once with the several Governments\r\n    concerned with a view to securing a general and agreed\r\n    reduction of the crushing burden which, on their existing\r\n    scale, armaments still impose on the impoverished peoples\r\n    of the world, sapping their resources and imperilling their\r\n    recovery from the ravages of war.”\r\n\r\nThe Washington Conference has made some progress along this line.\r\n\r\nThe matter was emphasized in more detail in the following resolution\r\nunanimously adopted by the Financial Conference:\r\n\r\n    “It is, therefore, imperative that every Government should,\r\n    as the first social and financial reform, on which all others\r\n    depend—\r\n\r\n    “(_a_) Restrict its ordinary recurrent expenditure, including\r\n    the service of the debt, to such an amount as can be covered by\r\n    its ordinary revenue.\r\n\r\n    “(_b_) Rigidly reduce all expenditure on armaments in so far as\r\n    such reduction is compatible with the preservation of national\r\n    security.\r\n\r\n    “(_c_) Abandon all unproductive extraordinary expenditure.\r\n\r\n    “(_d_) Restrict even productive extraordinary expenditure to\r\n    the lowest possible amount.”\r\n\r\nThe effect on industry of unnecessary national expenditure is immediate,\r\ndirect, and, at these times, absolutely calamitous. The greater the\r\nnational expenditure the higher necessarily must be the taxation required\r\nto provide for the interest on, and the redemption of the debt. Every\r\npenny absorbed in unnecessary taxation is so much money diverted from\r\nreproductive industry. If a manufacturer is paying 6_s._ 8_d._ in the £\r\nin income-tax and super-tax, the effect is the same as if he worked as a\r\nbond-slave to the Government for four months in the year, during which\r\ntime the Government appropriated the whole of the output of his factory.\r\n\r\n\r\nLowering of Taxation\r\n\r\nFor the restoration of industry an immediate reduction of taxation\r\nis imperatively required. The dangerous height to which taxation has\r\nmounted operates with devastating results on industry. Many business\r\nfirms have had to sell securities to pay their taxes; these have been\r\npurchased by American investors. The Government points with pride to the\r\nimprovement of American exchange; at whose expense? Certainly, in part,\r\nat that of British industry. While firms have thus to sacrifice capital\r\nassets, or even to borrow money to pay current taxation, industry can\r\nnever be restored, and each month it continues, the period of industrial\r\nconvalescence is materially prolonged. Case after case has come before my\r\npersonal observation where employers, content to make a small margin of\r\nprofit or no profit at all, but only sufficient to cover standing charges\r\nand prime costs, have deliberately decided, when faced with certain loss\r\nowing to the grinding burden of taxation, rather than embark any new\r\ncapital in extending their businesses, or in adding to them some new\r\nbranch of industry which would have provided employment for many men, to\r\nput their money on bank deposit or invest it in gilt-edged securities.\r\nThe effect of such a course on industry and unemployment is disastrous.\r\nIf initiative and enterprise, which, in this country, form the life-blood\r\nof industry, are to escape extinction, then taxation on industry must\r\nspeedily be reduced. The directions in which business men are pressing\r\nfor alleviation from the insupportable oppression of taxation are in\r\nthe reduction of the rate of income-tax, exemption from super-tax of\r\nreserves invested in the business, and abolition of the corporation\r\nprofits tax. The latter falls entirely upon the ordinary shareholders in\r\naddition to income-tax; preference shareholders and debenture holders are\r\nnot mulcted, but receive in full their prescribed rate of dividend or\r\ninterest less income-tax. The corporation tax thus operates as a severe\r\ndeterrent on initiative, especially in regard to the starting of new,\r\nand extension of existing, enterprises. There is also a growing volume\r\nof opinion in favour of funding certain annual national expenditure,\r\ne.g. pensions, as an alternative to raising the necessary expenditure by\r\ntaxing. Better surely the disadvantages of borrowing with the advantages\r\nof a revival of trade, than the satisfaction of theoretically sound\r\nfinance with the misfortune of being overtaken in the race for foreign\r\nmarkets by continental competitors.\r\n\r\n\r\nStabilizing the Exchanges\r\n\r\nLabour contends that the Government can materially assist industries\r\nwhich cater for our export trade by stabilizing the exchanges. It appears\r\nto contemplate reversion to some such system as “pegging” the exchanges,\r\nwhich was customary during the war. The International Financial\r\nConference pronounced on that procedure as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Attempts to limit fluctuations in exchange by imposing\r\n    artificial control on exchange operations are futile and\r\n    mischievous. In so far as they are effective, they falsify\r\n    the market, tend to remove natural correctives to such\r\n    fluctuations, and interfere with free dealings in forward\r\n    exchange which are so necessary to enable traders to eliminate\r\n    from their calculations a margin to cover risk of exchange,\r\n    which would otherwise contribute to the rise in prices.\r\n    Moreover, all Government interference with trade, including\r\n    exchange, tends to impede that improvement of the economic\r\n    conditions of a country by which alone a healthy and stable\r\n    exchange can be secured.”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, “the present chaotic conditions of the exchanges\r\nmakes international trade,”—to quote the Federation of British\r\nIndustries—“instead of being a matter of reasonable foresight and\r\ncalculation, a game of chance, in which the rules and stakes are\r\nperpetually altering without the will or knowledge of the player.”\r\n\r\nIt does not seem that much can be done in the direction of steadying\r\nthe exchanges except to put such pressure as is practicable on foreign\r\ncountries to cease inflation by printing paper money, to balance their\r\nbudgets, and to stabilize their currencies and re-anchor them to gold,\r\nthough not necessarily in the same parity as pre-war, at the same\r\ntime adding to the national wealth, on which sound currency is based,\r\nby increasing national production, decreasing consumption, reducing\r\nexpenditure, and prompting public and private economy.\r\n\r\n\r\nRevision of Financial Policy\r\n\r\nBusiness men contend that stability and not inflation or deflation\r\nshould have been aimed at by the Government, and that industry has been\r\ngravely injured by the instability resulting from the Government’s\r\nfinancial policy of deflating with the object of restoring an effective\r\ngold standard. In pursuance of this policy, towards the end of 1919, the\r\nbank rate was raised from 5 per cent. to 6 per cent., and Treasury Bill\r\nrate from 4½ per cent. to 5½ per cent.; then in April 1920, the bank\r\nrate was further raised to 7 per cent.[19] and the Treasury Bill to 6½\r\nper cent. Appended to the Report of the War Wealth Committee, published\r\nin May 1920, is a Treasury Memorandum explaining the policy. Inflation\r\nand deflation are ambiguous terms; the Government has explained its\r\nunderstanding of them to be the increase or decrease respectively of\r\npurchasing power relative to the amount of commodities available for\r\npurchase—purchasing power being measured by the amount of bank deposits\r\nand currency in circulation. A masterly description of the nature and\r\neffect on industry of the Government’s policy was given by the Right\r\nHon. R. McKenna at the Ordinary General Meeting of the London Joint\r\nCity and Midland Bank, Limited, on January 28, 1921. Mr. McKenna drew\r\nthe distinction, almost invariably overlooked, between “speculative\r\ninflation”—a temporary condition remediable by making money dearer and\r\nrestricting credit—and “monetary inflation”—a more or less permanent\r\ncondition which cannot so be remedied. In regard to the latter he said:\r\n“Dear money and a rigid restriction of credit, so far from proving an\r\neffective means of restoring trade to a wholesome condition, could only\r\naggravate our evils.” Monetary inflation was due to gigantic war-time\r\nborrowing by the Government, not for increasing industrial production,\r\nbut almost entirely for consumption. As loans remained outstanding after\r\nthe commodities had been consumed, there was an immense increase of\r\npurchasing power relative to the amount of commodities available for\r\npurchase. Mr. McKenna pointed out that the first effects of an attempt at\r\nmonetary deflation would be to cause severe trade depression, manifesting\r\nitself in a fall in wholesale prices, due to goods being thrown upon\r\nthe market by traders who were unable to carry their stocks or who had\r\nfailed in business; a diminution in production; a reduction in prices; a\r\ngrowth in unemployment; reduced purchasing power of wage-earners, and so\r\na further fall in wholesale and retail prices, and later, in consequence\r\nof the trade depression, a decline in national revenue without any\r\ndiminution of the permanent liabilities of the Government. To pay taxes\r\ntraders would have to borrow from their banks; to meet national expenses\r\nGovernment would have to resort to bank loans, and credit inflation would\r\nagain ensue. Mr. McKenna conclusively showed that monetary deflation can\r\nonly be achieved through repayment of the immense Government loans, which\r\ncannot be effected by the imposition of additional taxation, as that\r\nwould bring immediate ruin upon our commerce and manufacture, but only\r\nfrom funds secured by the most rigid economy in national expenditure,\r\nand by increasing the commodities available for purchase through the\r\nstimulation of production and of trade.\r\n\r\nThere are some drastic remedies which leave the patient cured of\r\nhis disease, but dead from general debility; monetary deflation, as\r\npractised by the Government, is one of them. It is no satisfaction to\r\nthe manufacturer whose works are closed down, or the worker who is\r\nunemployed, to be told that the currency is being restored to pre-war\r\nparity of exchange. They see in the United Kingdom and the United\r\nStates—exponents of this process—a larger proportion of the population\r\nunemployed than in any other industrial country, and these are the two\r\nwealthiest countries in the world, with the greatest foreign trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nReconsideration of Reparations Policy\r\n\r\nNo one suggests that Germany should be relieved from payment of\r\nreparations or that the Government should be dissuaded from insisting\r\non payment by any fraudulent bankruptcy on the part of Germany. At the\r\nsame time there is real urgency for clear thinking and decisive action on\r\nthe part of the Government in regard to the amount and mode of payment.\r\nThe Government’s original figure of 20,000 millions turned out to be a\r\nridiculous over-estimate, afterwards reduced by the Ultimatum of London\r\nto a maximum yearly payment of 400 millions. To make the payment, the\r\nsurplus of the value of Germany’s exported saleable commodities over the\r\ncost of her imported raw materials and food must at least equal that\r\namount. Pressed to provide that surplus she must necessarily undersell\r\nour manufacturers in foreign markets, which she will and can do by\r\ndepreciating the mark in foreign exchange so as to keep its external\r\nbelow its internal value. This results in a premium on German exports,\r\nand the undercutting of our commodities in those markets. Mr. McKenna’s\r\nreasoned speech to his bank on January 27, 1922, is worthy of close\r\nattention. “Before Germany could meet her full liability,” says Mr.\r\nMcKenna, “before she could develop her foreign trade to such a degree as\r\nto have an exportable surplus of 400 millions a year, the foreign trade\r\nof this country, her chief competitor, must dwindle into insignificance.”\r\nSpeaking from the economic point of view, he goes on to point out that\r\nGermany can pay annually “to the full extent of the export surplus her\r\ntrade can give her without forcing the external value of the mark below\r\nits internal value ... she can pay in specified commodities, which in\r\nour case might include sugar, timber, potash, and other materials which\r\nare indispensable to us, but which we either do not produce at all or in\r\ninsufficient quantities. She can pay also by the surrender of any foreign\r\nsecurities her nationals may possess, so far as they can be traced, and,\r\nif the Allies are willing to accept this form of payment, by the direct\r\nemployment of her labour in reconstructing devastated areas.” There can\r\nhardly be much question that vacillation in the reparations policy has\r\nbeen productive of serious injury to our foreign trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nInter-Allies Debts\r\n\r\nThe restoration of international trade depends also on a sound and\r\nsensible recognition by those of the Allies who are creditor nations of\r\nthe economic effects of enforcing payment of the indebtedness to them by\r\nthe Governments of debtor nations, coupled with such action as they, in\r\nthe interests of civilization and of their own countries, find themselves\r\nable to take in the direction of modification. Government war-debts have\r\nproduced for no debtor country any increase of its national wealth; they\r\ncan be paid by the debtor country only out of its capital or its income.\r\nIn regard to the first alternative, no debtor country can possibly, under\r\nany scheme of finance, pay its government war-debts out of capital,\r\nthat is to say, out of home or foreign securities in the hands of its\r\nGovernment or its nationals, or out of cash balances standing to the\r\ncredit abroad of either or both of them. If those debts are to be paid\r\nat all, it must be out of income, that is to say, out of the surplus\r\nrealized by the export of natural products, manufactured goods, services\r\nand “invisible exports,” after payment of the expenses involved in\r\nproducing such surplus, e.g. cost of raw material, labour involved in\r\nmanufacture, and other costs of production and expenses of rendering\r\nthe services. Now, the dominant fact to-day is that the debtor nations’\r\navailable surpluses are either insufficient, or not more than sufficient,\r\nto cover their pre-war debts. How then in each case is the surplus to be\r\nso enormously increased as to cover the fresh indebtedness resulting from\r\nthe Great War? In one way only—by enormously increased production, and by\r\na reduction in the national standard of living. Nothing is more certain\r\nthan the absolute impossibility of any debtor country being able to pay\r\nits war-debts under its present standard of production and of living.\r\nSupposing, however, it to be practicable, and that it is determined to\r\ncompel each debtor country to create the requisite surplus, what would\r\nbe the peril to international trade of such forced payments? Mr. F. C.\r\nGoodenough—the Chairman of Barclay’s Bank—has explained the position with\r\ncogent clarity; his illuminating exposition will be found in _The Times_\r\nof April 11, 1922.\r\n\r\nFirst let us consider how much of the needed surplus can be created by\r\nincreased production. It obviously involves enormously greater output on\r\nthe part of labour each working hour, the introduction of very greatly\r\nimproved organization and of time- and labour-saving appliances, which,\r\napart from the new spirit it would demand in industry, would entail a\r\ndrain upon capital resources for their provision, that, at this present\r\ntime of scarcity, could not be met, and a general alteration in price\r\nlevels. Our difficulty to-day is to attain even to our pre-war standard\r\nof efficient and effective output. We are living to-day largely upon\r\nour capital and not upon income. But, assuming that debtor nations can\r\ngo some way towards paying their war-time indebtedness by increased\r\nproduction, they plainly cannot go anything like the full length; they\r\nmust fall back, if pressed, on a reduction of their standard of living\r\nwhich would be primarily effected by a reduction in industrial wages.\r\nThen mark the effect upon creditor nations. If wages in a debtor nation\r\nare reduced, and costs of production are correspondingly brought down\r\nwithout any equivalent diminution in the efficiency of labour, that\r\ndebtor nation is in a position, and, if put under pressure to pay its\r\nwar-debts, is compelled to put its manufactured commodities into foreign\r\nmarkets at prices considerably lower than its creditor nation with a\r\nhigher standard of living can afford to do. This unfair competition\r\napplies not merely to creditor nations, but to all nations trading in the\r\nsame competitive foreign markets. But, then, follow the matter one stage\r\nfarther: if the other nations, under the stress of this competition,\r\nbring down their costs of production to the same level, the debtor nation\r\nloses its preferential position in the foreign markets and ceases to be\r\nin a position to pay its war indebtedness.\r\n\r\nEven by means of increased production, and a reduced standard of living,\r\na debtor country may be unable to meet its war indebtedness in full.\r\nShould it be forced to do so, it must borrow the balance of the money\r\nannually due, which can seldom be achieved by external or internal\r\nloans, but usually by increase of paper currency which soon brings its\r\nown retribution—national bankruptcy. The total amount of Inter-Allied\r\nDebts, as between the United States of America, Great Britain, France,\r\nItaly, Russia and Belgium, is 4,000 millions sterling, to which, if the\r\nReparation payments of 6,600 millions sterling are added, makes a total\r\nof 10,600 millions sterling which does not include the war-debt owing by\r\neach country to its own nationals nor by the Dominions to Great Britain.\r\nMr. Goodenough’s suggestions were eminently practical, that the amount\r\nto be paid by each debtor nation should be fixed as soon as possible,\r\nso as to clear away the present disturbing atmosphere of uncertainty,\r\nthat bonds for as long a period as practicable should be created by each\r\ndebtor country representing the total amount of its national war-debt,\r\nand that these should be gradually offered to the public for investment\r\nsupported by the national guarantees of the debtor country. Bonds handed\r\nby one debtor nation to a creditor nation in respect of a debt could be\r\nendorsed by the latter nation to another country in respect of a debt\r\nowing by the endorsor to the endorsee, and so find a ready market among\r\ninvestors all over the world. Each country creating a bond would be\r\ncompelled to provide a fund out of its own taxation for the redemption of\r\nits own bonds. The scheme of Mr. Goodenough urgently needs consideration,\r\nas the whole question of Inter-Ally indebtedness calls for a decision.\r\n\r\n\r\nExport Credits\r\n\r\nActing with prudence, and exercising co-operation with business men, the\r\nGovernment can, as experience has shown, beneficially use its credit to\r\nassist sound trading between this and foreign countries and to enable\r\nworks to be carried out which provide employment; and so long as the\r\nGovernment employs the normal machinery of finance and commerce, much can\r\nbe done in this way to further the restoration of trade and industry. The\r\nExport Credits Scheme administered by the Department of Overseas Trade\r\nis conferring substantial benefits on industry in stimulating orders\r\nfrom abroad, and developing markets to replace those permanently lost\r\nor temporarily closed to us in countries which are, at the time being,\r\npotential producers of commodities exchangeable for the commodities we\r\nproduce. The guarantee of loans so ably administered by the Advisory\r\nCommittee under the Trade Facilities Act, 1921, is materially encouraging\r\nsound commercial business.\r\n\r\n\r\nBringing down Costs of Production\r\n\r\nBut after all is said and done, we are living in a fool’s paradise if\r\nwe think that, even when financial equilibrium and stability have been\r\nattained, we shall be able to compete in foreign markets at our present\r\n_real_ costs of output. Wages constitute the greatest proportion of costs\r\nof production in every industry, and wages will have to be reduced—the\r\nstandard of living of 1920-1 cannot be maintained. A lower standard of\r\nprofits must likewise be accepted by employers. There must be equality of\r\nsacrifice all round. Labour argues that reduction of wages in industry\r\nmeans diminished national purchasing power, and consequently increased\r\ntrade depression. That is only true when there is an effective demand at\r\nexisting prices for the output of industry. The object now is to reduce\r\ncosts so as to get down to a price at which demand may be effective. The\r\nfoolish expectations nurtured by the working-classes of getting out of\r\nthe war a higher standard of living than they enjoyed before the war was\r\nlargely due to the utterly impossible—and sometimes grotesque—pictures\r\npainted by members of the Government of “the good times coming.” These\r\nreductions in cost by reductions of wages and profits can be immediate;\r\nany reductions in cost of production through improvement of management,\r\norganization and plant or increasing the efficiency of labour’s output,\r\nwhile necessary for the permanent well-being of industry, are too slow\r\nacting for the present emergency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHT RELATIONSHIP OF GOVERNMENT TO INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n    2. The Normal Position of Government in Relation to\r\n    Industry—Regulation of Factory Conditions—Conciliation and not\r\n    Intervention—Protection of the Community—Wages in Unorganized\r\n    Industries—Industrial Research—Need of a Real Ministry of\r\n    Labour—Regulation of Combinations and Monopolies.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE NORMAL POSITION OF GOVERNMENT IN RELATION TO INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nWe must now consider the relationship of Government to industry in normal\r\ntimes. Whether or not any particular industries should be nationalized\r\nand thereafter conducted as State industries or under some other system\r\nthan the present, are constitutional questions to be decided by the\r\nGovernment in power in accordance with what they believe to be the will\r\nof the people. That the author of this book is strongly opposed to\r\nnationalization as a general principle of industrial organization is\r\nsufficiently apparent from what has already been written and for the\r\nreasons given. Assuming, however, that there is no nationalization of an\r\nindustry, but that it continues on a reformed basis of private ownership,\r\nit is important to discuss under what circumstances the Government ought\r\nto intervene in regard to any question affecting the administration and\r\ncontrol of that industry, or, indeed, of all industries in general. Our\r\nrecent experience of Government direction of industries, both during\r\nand after the war, assists us in answering that question. If, as during\r\nthe war, a large supply of munitions has to be organized at a moment’s\r\nnotice, and maintained irrespective of all considerations of economy\r\nand industrial efficiency, probably no other course would remain but\r\nfor the Government of the day to control the industries concerned; but,\r\nin normal times, when economy of production is imperative, industrial\r\nefficiency essential, and enterprising and far-sighted administration\r\nof paramount importance, Government direction has shown itself to be\r\nquite hopeless. Employers and Trade Unions are in firm agreement on\r\nthis point, that Government control of industry spells ineptitude,\r\nincompetence, extravagance, and confusion all along the line. We may,\r\ntherefore, emphasize this as the first cardinal principle regulating the\r\nrelationship of Government to industry: that the circumstances are few\r\nand seldom arise which justify intervention by Government in the economic\r\nadministration and control of any industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegulation of Factory Conditions\r\n\r\nThe Government is however bound to assert its right to intervene, in\r\norder to prevent the existence of, and, where they have arisen, to\r\nremove, industrial conditions which are injurious to the health and\r\nwelfare of the workers as a whole or any particular section of them. This\r\nis action in respect of which every Government would always have behind\r\nit the full approval of the social conscience. But for the intervention\r\nof the Government in days gone by, the dehumanizing conditions attending\r\nchild-labour and the employment of women in workshops would never have\r\nbeen removed, and English factories would not be to-day as they are, the\r\nfirst in the world for health, sanitation and good amenities. In the\r\nearly days of last century, when factory legislation was first proposed,\r\nthe employers of one large Yorkshire woollen town came in formal\r\ndeputation to London to protest that, if there were any interference by\r\nAct of Parliament with their liberty to employ as they pleased, in their\r\nwoollen manufactories, young children for such hours as they thought fit,\r\na death-blow would be struck to the trade of England. Those days have\r\ngone, and with them that class of employer.\r\n\r\nUnder the Factory Acts and the skilled and far-sighted supervision of\r\nthe Home Office Factory Inspectors, an immense amount has been done to\r\npromote the health of the workers, the safety of their occupations,\r\nand freedom from preventible dangers. None but the most hardened of\r\nindividualistic employers—and few of them now remain—object to sound and\r\nreasonable State regulation in matters such as these. He welcomes it for\r\nhis own protection.\r\n\r\n\r\nConciliation and not Intervention\r\n\r\nIt is more in regard to industrial disputes concerning wages and\r\nconditions of employment that the Government is too prone to intervene.\r\nThere must always be a Ministry of Labour to keep in close touch with\r\nindustrial disputes. Such a Ministry, though it should in the first\r\ninstance leave employers and employed to discuss matters through the\r\nconciliation machinery that exists in each particular industry, yet, by\r\ndiscreet and impartial action, can do most valuable work in smoothing\r\nover ruptures in negotiations when neither side from motives of dignity\r\nor strategy will move. That is a different thing altogether from the\r\nCabinet rushing in. The public will never know the extent to which\r\nindustrial harmony in this country has been preserved on occasions of\r\nstress by the efforts towards conciliation exerted by the Ministry of\r\nLabour and its predecessor, the Conciliation Department of the Board of\r\nTrade, and sometimes under the greatest difficulties. At times when the\r\nMinistry had arranged between employers and Trade Unions a formula for\r\nthe solution of a wage dispute or the termination of a strike or other\r\nindustrial controversy, the recalcitrant leaders of some Union, entering\r\ninto temporary alliance with other turbulent spirits, would speed found\r\nin deputation to the Cabinet at 10, Downing Street, and seldom be denied\r\nadmission. Frequently, other terms would be suggested by the Cabinet for\r\nthe sake of peace, probably more favourable to the workers than those\r\narranged by the Ministry of Labour. The results were disastrous, the\r\nprestige of the Ministry suffered a serious relapse, the repute of the\r\nTrade Union leaders who agreed terms with the Ministry was damaged in the\r\neyes of their members almost irretrievably, the rebellious section of the\r\nUnion was given a resounding advertisement at the expense of industrial\r\nconstitutional government—no surer way to sow the seeds of disruption and\r\nindiscipline in any Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nProtection of the Community\r\n\r\nBut it will be asked what is to happen when the employers and Unions\r\nconcerned in our great national industries decline to come together. In\r\nthat event, the Government, through the Ministry of Labour, must, as\r\nthe latter has so frequently done with tact and efficiency, endeavour\r\nto bring the two sides to a conference. That can usually be done. The\r\nMinistry has power under the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, to appoint a\r\nCourt of Inquiry, but this power in practice is of little use unless\r\nboth sides agree. Public opinion, however, can always be relied on\r\nstrongly to resent employers and unions standing at arm’s length; but\r\nbefore it can, or will, operate, a definite open effort must be made\r\nto put them into touch with one another. Negotiations once instituted\r\nmay culminate in an agreement, or end in a rupture, so that a strike or\r\nlock-out appears inevitable. Then there is generally but one sound course\r\nfor the Government to pursue: at once to refer the dispute through the\r\nappropriate Government Department to the Industrial Court, and obtain\r\nits impartial and experienced decision upon the issue. Whether either\r\nor both parties will submit to the arbitrament of the Court is purely\r\nvoluntary—we have not compulsory industrial arbitration in this country.\r\nIt has failed in Canada and Australia; it failed here disastrously during\r\nthe war. If men are to be compelled to accept an award, employers must be\r\ncompelled, if the Court so decide, to carry on their works at a loss. But\r\nthe public has no patience with any party to a wages dispute who will not\r\nagree to the reference of his claim to an independent tribunal, or who,\r\nhaving agreed to the submission, refuses to accept the award. One of the\r\nmost important present-day functions of such a tribunal is to analyse the\r\nclaim and see to what extent the claim is a genuine industrial demand,\r\nor part of the revolutionary programme of extremists for squeezing all\r\nprivate profit out of industry so as to force “nationalization and\r\ndemocratic control” or some other favourite socialistic scheme. The one\r\nfatal course is for the Cabinet to attempt itself to handle industrial\r\ndisputes.\r\n\r\nStill, after or without an inquiry by the Industrial Court, a strike or\r\nlock-out may occur. Then the primary duty of the Government is to stand\r\nfirm, refuse all concessions, and protect the community; nothing less is\r\nadequate for the maintenance of social order. Too often employers and\r\nUnions complacently think that the Government should stand aside and\r\nlet them fight it out over the prostrate public. In saying that they\r\nforget the paramount interests of the community. Every principle of\r\ndemocratic government negatives the right of a section of the community\r\nso to attempt to enforce its arbitrary will, and where, by refusing an\r\nindependent arbitration and then calling a strike or lock-out, it does\r\nso, it is the plain duty of the Government to provide for the continuance\r\nof public services and to maintain a skeleton organization in being for\r\nthat purpose. This is not acting as strike-breaker between employer and\r\nemployed. But let not the measures for the protection of the community\r\nbe taken in stealth. Why should there be any secrecy about the matter?\r\nThe obligation and intention of the Government always so to act should be\r\nopenly affirmed. As Labour has officially adopted the anti-social policy\r\nof “direct action,” the Trade Disputes Act of 1906 should be repealed.\r\nWhatever reason of political expediency—there was none in law or in\r\nlogic—justified the application of the Act to cases of economic strikes\r\nbetween employers and employed, no pretext remains for its retention in\r\ncases of strikes against the community, especially where an independent\r\ninquiry has been refused. The Government can successfully measure its\r\nstrength against any such strike, if only it will give the fullest\r\npossible publicity to the issues, for public opinion will always split\r\nlike a steel wedge the solidarity of such anti-social action.\r\n\r\n\r\nWages in Unorganized Industries\r\n\r\nOne particular class of wages questions does demand intervention by\r\nthe Government. In well-ordered industries, where organizations exist\r\neffectively representing the employers and employed engaged in the\r\nindustry, wages and conditions ought to be left as matters for collective\r\nbargaining. There are, however, many industries which are so scattered\r\nthrough the country or so subject to conditions incompatible with good\r\norganization as to make collective bargaining impossible. In them\r\nreasonable minimum wages and conditions must be secured, and it is the\r\nduty of the Government to see that such provision is made, unless it is\r\nprepared to acquiesce in “sweated labour trades.” Hitherto, the provision\r\nhas taken the form of a Trade Board for the industry under the Trade\r\nBoards Act, and there is no doubt that type of organization must continue\r\nin appropriate cases. Much criticism has been levelled against the Trade\r\nBoards, on which Lord Cave’s Committee[20] has now reported fully. From\r\ntheir inception up to the war, Trade Boards on the whole were successful.\r\nThe defects that subsequently developed in the system were due to the\r\nfact that the far-flung series of Trade Boards, constituted immediately\r\nafter the war, had none of the experience nor traditions of the old\r\nBoards; their chairmen and independent members were very largely persons\r\nwithout practical experience of industrial problems, and necessarily of\r\nthat category, because of the large number of such appointments to be\r\nfilled. They did not confine themselves to prescribing minimum wages and\r\nconditions—their proper function—so as to avoid sweated conditions, but\r\nthey attempted to regulate actual wages and conditions, a very different\r\nmatter. They also applied war-time standards to peace-time circumstances,\r\nand that naturally plunged a nascent and struggling industry into great\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndustrial Research\r\n\r\nIndustrial research becomes daily more essential for industrial progress.\r\nIt has been developed to a greater extent in Germany and the United\r\nStates of America than with us. Much of the industrial prosperity\r\nin those two countries is due to the establishment of associations,\r\nand, indeed, of highly developed departments by individual firms for\r\nindustrial research. Much is being done, and still more remains to be\r\ndone, by individual firms and by trade associations in this country\r\nin that direction. There is no doubt that this kind of work can more\r\neffectively be conducted in that way than by any Government Department,\r\nbut, at the same time, a Government Department is required to co-ordinate\r\nand stimulate rather than to control such private efforts. In this way,\r\nmost valuable work is being done by the Department of Scientific and\r\nIndustrial Research. This will always remain an important sphere for\r\nGovernment industrial activity.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeed of a Real Ministry of Labour\r\n\r\nIf we are to have anything like effective and efficient labour\r\nadministration, a Ministry of Labour is essential. Those who call\r\nfor abolition of the Ministry are truly neophytes in the art of\r\nindustrial government. Convinced believers, let us assume them to be,\r\nin the principle of _laissez-aller_, they actually think that if the\r\nMinistry disappeared there would be an end of all intervention by\r\nGovernment between employers and employed. What uninformed criticism!\r\nThey forget that the Home Office has control of the administration of\r\nthe Factory Acts—a matter embracing working conditions and welfare of\r\nworkers which goes right to the root of the Labour problem. They omit\r\nto notice that the Mines Department of the Board of Trade exercises\r\nsupervision over the conditions of employment and wages of miners; that\r\nthe Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for the Joint Conciliation\r\nCommittees which deal with exactly similar questions in agriculture;\r\nthat the Ministry of Transport does the same in the railway service,\r\nand that the Ministry of Health has jurisdiction over health insurance\r\nso largely handled by the Approved-Societies-sections of the Trade\r\nUnions, and over the administration of the Poor Law relief which so\r\nnearly touches the unemployment problem. These various jurisdictions\r\nare admittedly to stand—it could not be, and indeed is not contended\r\notherwise. The Ministry of Labour is, however, to disappear, and its\r\nresponsibilities—unemployment insurance, trade boards, labour exchanges,\r\nconciliation of trade disputes, co-ordination of Labour administration\r\nin this country in conformity with the International Labour Organization\r\ncreated by the Peace Treaty—are to be extinguished or tacked on as\r\nappendages to other departments. The resulting position is too ridiculous\r\nto contemplate. Under such circumstances the Government could never\r\nbe advised on any basis of consistent administration and policy in\r\nregard to any labour question; continuous touch would be lost with the\r\nrepresentative Trade Union federations; there would be as many opinions\r\nas there were departments implicated. Whenever a national strike was\r\nimminent in any great industry, the Government would have to organize an\r\nimprovised committee of the Departments concerned in labour—probably few\r\nof them even remotely connected with the particular industry affected—and\r\ntry to evolve an _ad hoc_ policy. We are suffering still from the\r\neffects of opportunist action of that kind and want no repetition. And\r\nwhen Government intervention in a national strike becomes inevitable\r\nfor the protection of the community, he would be a bold man who would\r\nprefer negotiations by the Cabinet conducted on no set principle and\r\nfounded on no experience of industrial conditions, to negotiations by the\r\nMinistry of Labour, which does conduct such business on a settled basis\r\nof principle, knowing the interconnection of trade with trade and the\r\neffect which a concession like the 12½ per cent. bonus to one section of\r\nindustry produces upon all other sections, and appreciates the danger\r\nof settling strikes in the way the South Wales Coal Strike of 1915 was\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\nIt has been amply proved by bitter experience that no branch of human\r\nactivity stands in more urgent need of even administration on uniform\r\nand consistent lines than does labour. Granted that employers and\r\nemployed should settle between themselves so far as possible their own\r\ndisputes, there comes inevitably a stage when a settlement or failure\r\nto settle intimately affects the community. It is then that the offices\r\nof a properly constituted Ministry of Labour come into play. If it is\r\ndesired to leave the public merely as a football between employers and\r\nemployed then abolish the Ministry. Far from abolishing it, in my view\r\nit ought to be consolidated and vested with extended powers. It ought to\r\nbe made in fact, not merely in name, a real Ministry of Labour. All the\r\npowers of the other Government Departments which relate to labour should\r\nbe transferred to it, so that there would be one central department\r\ncharged with and responsible for the administration of all labour in this\r\ncountry. A great part of the labour disorganization during the war which\r\nhas been used as an argument for abolition of the Ministry of Labour,\r\nand in derogation of the great national services performed by it, was\r\nentirely due to this clash between different departments in regard to\r\nlabour administration: the Admiralty bidding against the Ministry of\r\nMunitions by paying higher wages to the same class of men and settling\r\nstrikes on more advantageous terms to the workers; the Agricultural\r\nWages Board of the Ministry of Agriculture putting up wages of\r\nagricultural labourers to a height that upset the country railway porters\r\nwho were drawn from them. Innumerable other instances could be given, all\r\ndirectly due to the sub-division of labour administration among a number\r\nof different and hostile Government departments. It is not unimportant\r\nin this connection to remember that when, in the beginning of 1917, the\r\nMinistry of Labour, which was originally a conception of the Trades Union\r\nCongress, was formed by Mr. Lloyd George’s first Coalition Government,\r\nit was intended to transfer to it all the labour powers of the other\r\nGovernment departments. This was fiercely resisted by every department\r\nwhich it was proposed to denude of any powers, and in great measure\r\nsuccessfully. As a result of that internecine warfare, the present\r\nMinistry of Labour is unhappily but an emasculated edition of the fully\r\nendowed central department that Mr. Lloyd George wisely had in mind. The\r\nwonder is that it has done as well as it has with such a disappointing\r\nlimitation of powers. But apart from home labour administration, we\r\nshall get into most serious international complications, and very great\r\ndomestic difficulty, if proper touch is not maintained with, and the\r\ninterests of the country properly voiced in, the International Labour\r\nOrganization which exercises now very considerable influence over labour\r\nlegislation and administration in every country, party to the League\r\nof Nations. That cannot possibly be managed if the responsibility is\r\nto be scattered over half a dozen partially interested and wholly\r\nunco-ordinated Government departments.\r\n\r\nIf the labour sections of other Government departments were united with\r\nthe Ministry of Labour, very great economies could be effected: factory\r\nand trade board inspectorates could be combined; health and unemployment\r\ninspectorates could also be amalgamated; in fact, one central\r\ninspectorate could well perform all the four kinds of inspection duties.\r\nThese are but a few illustrations. The various labour duties performed\r\nby the different Government departments are so obviously one and the\r\nsame that it is inconceivable why the overlapping which exists should be\r\ntolerated any longer. It is the one thing in our labour administration\r\nthat passes the comprehension of foreign critics.\r\n\r\nSome of those who suggest the abolition of the Ministry of Labour propose\r\nto constitute in its place a National Industrial Council, consisting of\r\nan equal number of representatives of Employers’ Associations and Trade\r\nUnions with a chairman nominated by the Government, as recommended by\r\nthe Report of the Provisional Joint Committee of Employers and Trade\r\nUnions to the Industrial Conference, convened by the Government on\r\nFebruary 27, 1919, when the miners’ strike was threatening. The duty\r\nof the National Industrial Council would be to make recommendations in\r\nregard to controversial industrial matters. If the Unions _bona fide_\r\nwill undertake to use such a Council, or Parliament of Industry as it is\r\nsometimes called, for the purpose of promoting good relations between\r\nemployers and employed, its creation would be of value. That implies\r\nthe continuance in industry of the private employer. But, on the other\r\nhand, if the Unions intend to work for the elimination of the private\r\nemployer from industry, as they declared their intention to do in the\r\nMemorandum (_see_ p. 59) annexed by the Right Hon. Arthur Henderson to\r\nthe Report of the Provisional Joint Committee, then the creation of a\r\nParliament of Industry would be a farce, and merely degenerate into an\r\norganized means to the Unions’ real end. In any event, the scope of\r\na National Joint Council is limited. No Union will acquiesce in the\r\njudgment of other Unions on its domestic affairs—imagine boilermakers\r\naccepting the decision of plumbers, electricians and fitters on a\r\nquestion concerning the demarcation of boilermakers’ work. As it was,\r\nminers, railwaymen and transport workers absented themselves from the\r\nIndustrial Conference in 1919. Moreover, employers and Trade Unions will\r\nalways agree, to the serious discomfiture of Government, on reforms of\r\nwhich the expenses are to fall not on industry but on national funds, but\r\nthe question of such expenditure is surely one to be reserved exclusively\r\nfor Parliament. The Ministry of Labour has always the General Council to\r\nconsult, which represents the whole of organized labour, and the National\r\nConfederation of Employers’ Organizations, reinforced for consultation\r\nwith any employers’ organizations outside that Confederation. If a joint\r\nconference with employers and Trade Unions is desired by Government such\r\ncan always now be easily arranged.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegulation of Combinations and Monopolies\r\n\r\nCombination is inherent in industrial progress; this is fully recognized\r\nby Labour. The addendum to the Report of the Committee on Trusts\r\n(_Parliamentary Paper_, 1919, Cd. 9236) signed (amongst others) by\r\nsuch stalwart members of the Labour Party as Messrs. Bevan and Sidney\r\nWebb, stated: “We have to recognize that association and combination in\r\nproduction and distribution are steps to the greater efficiency, the\r\nincreased economy and the better organization of industry; we regard this\r\nevolution as inevitable and desirable.”\r\n\r\nThis fact compels the Government to protect the consuming public against\r\nexploitation by combinations and monopolies. The principles along which\r\nsuch protective action should proceed are indicated in the Report of this\r\nCommittee, which has received the official approval of the Federation\r\nof British Industries. Shortly put, they throw on the Board of Trade\r\nthe duty of inquiring into any reasonable complaints, of referring\r\nany questions arising out of their inquiry to a special tribunal for\r\ninvestigation and report, and of recommending to the Government action\r\nfor the remedying of any grievances found to exist by the tribunal.\r\nThe Federation properly insists upon two safeguards: first, avoidance\r\nof any restriction prejudicing the position of British industry in\r\nthe export trade, and, secondly, caution against any communication to\r\nforeign competitors of information regarding British trade associations\r\nor combines. There have been suggestions made by some public men that\r\nstatutory limits should be placed upon dividends of industrial concerns.\r\nSuch restrictions have in the past been imposed upon the payment of\r\ndividends by companies supplying, under powers of statutory monopoly,\r\npublic necessities like gas and water, but economic history shows\r\nconclusively that anything in the nature of a statutory limitation of\r\ndividends for concerns not supplying a monopoly but marketing its product\r\nin a competitive market is seriously destructive of efficiency and\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYED\r\n\r\n1. CONTENTMENT IN INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Provision against Unemployment—Equalization of\r\n    Demand for Labour—Insurance against Unemployment—Need of a\r\n    Job-Finding Organization—Insurance by State or Industry—State\r\n    Insurance—Insurance by Industry or Industries—Reform of Present\r\n    Out-Door Relief System—Unemployment Insurance by Firms.\r\n\r\n\r\nReform of the relationship in industry between employers and employed\r\ninvolves three things: securing contentment, achieving co-operation,\r\nincreasing production; these constitute the dynamic trinity. Only when\r\ncontentment can be secured is co-operation made possible; without\r\nco-operation there never can be efficient production; production alone\r\ncan create the prosperity which is the sole source of the financial\r\nability of any industry to pay high wages and maintain good conditions of\r\nemployment. Contentment does not mean stagnation; it means willingness to\r\nprogress under an accepted system—in other words, evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Provision against Unemployment\r\n\r\nIf we are to secure contentment in industry, unquestionably the first\r\nmatter to be dealt with is unemployment. A distinction must be drawn\r\nbetween normal unemployment—the result of seasonal or cyclic depressions\r\nin trade, which arise from circumstances well-known in industry, either\r\naffecting the world at large or peculiar to some country in particular,\r\nor special to some national industry—and the abnormal unemployment\r\nwhich has resulted from the Great War. We are now considering normal\r\nunemployment. What Government should do to deal with the abnormal\r\nunemployment occasioned by the war we have already discussed in Chapter\r\nXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nEqualization of Demand for Labour\r\n\r\nIn regard to normal unemployment there are two things only which can\r\nbe done:—first, to reduce, so far as possible, fluctuations in the\r\ndemand for labour between one year and another, and one season of the\r\nyear with another season of the same year, and, secondly, to make the\r\nbest provision economically practicable for the maintenance during times\r\nof trade depression of persons who are unemployed or under-employed.\r\nIt is most difficult to “equalize the demand for labour.” In ordinary\r\ncommercial business that is a matter largely outside the power of\r\nGovernment, employers, or Trade Unions. It is one of the privileges which\r\nis reserved for the consumer. The only directions in which fruitful\r\naction can be taken are to provide a system such as exists under the\r\nLabour Exchange organization, or that of certain Trade Unions, whereby\r\nthe workman out of a job can be put in touch with the employer who wants\r\nlabour of his particular description, and to arrange the execution of\r\npublic works by Government Departments or local authorities, and the\r\nmanufacture of stores or equipment for public purposes, the amount of\r\nwhich is more or less standard, so that by postponing some and expediting\r\nothers some advance is possible towards making more uniform the demand\r\nfor labour as between good times and bad. But the limits within which\r\nthis is a practicable policy are much narrower than is generally\r\nrealized, and immensely more restricted than is suggested by the Labour\r\nParty.\r\n\r\n\r\nInsurance against Unemployment\r\n\r\nAlthough to prevent unemployment is impossible, happily a great deal\r\ncan be done to mitigate the evils of unemployment when it does occur.\r\nUnder no system of organizing industry—in spite of the contentions of\r\nthe Labour Party that under its socialistic reconstruction of industry\r\nthere would be no unemployment—can any person be guaranteed continuous\r\nwork. It is possible, however, to spread the income of the industry\r\nin good times over bad times, so that when the latter supervene there\r\nwill be something coming in to the worker for him to live on. This is\r\nnot a dole as some people call it, but rather in the nature of deferred\r\npay. With that in operation there would be an end to what is called by\r\nLabour the “wages system.” The worker would no longer be paid wages for\r\nsuch time only as he is employed, but would receive pay for the time he\r\nworks and also pay during the time he is unable to work because of trade\r\ndepression. There must be in all industries, both on the side of labour\r\nand of the employer, a reserve of productive capacity to meet the peak\r\ndemands, and all employers with few exceptions recognize that it is their\r\nduty to apply some of the profits of good times for the maintenance of\r\nthis reserve of labour in their industry when unemployed at times other\r\nthan peak times, and of the general body of labour when unemployed or\r\nunder-employed at times of trade depression. But the provision against\r\nunemployment must be a joint fund to which both the employer and the\r\nworker contribute during good times.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeed of a Job-Finding Organization\r\n\r\nAs ancillary to any scheme for provision against unemployment, there\r\nmust be some effective organization in existence whose duty it is to\r\nendeavour to ascertain where there are any vacancies for workmen in which\r\nmen who are unemployed can be started. Obviously this is necessary both\r\nin the interests of the industry and of the actuarial solvency of the\r\nfund provided against unemployment. Unfortunately a substantial number of\r\npersons will always exist who prefer not to do work but yet be paid for\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nInsurance by State or Industry\r\n\r\nThe next question is by whom shall the provision for unemployment be\r\nmade? Shall it be by the State or by industry, that is to say, all\r\nindustries acting collectively, or by each industry for itself, or shall\r\nit be by individual firms? We shall consider these cases separately.\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of the times that when persons have omitted to do\r\nwhat they should have done and then find themselves in difficulties\r\nby reason of their omission, they call upon the State to remedy their\r\ndeficiency. Eliminating the question whether the State out of its own\r\nfinancial resources should make any addition to the fund contributed by\r\nemployers and employed for provision against unemployment, Government\r\nadministration of the fund is necessarily less efficient and more\r\nexpensive than administration by industries or by firms. Some striking\r\nfigures have been published in _The Times_ of January 25, 1922. It\r\nwas stated at the National Federation of Employees Approved Societies\r\nby a gentleman representing the British Xylonite Company that his\r\nfirm’s scheme of unemployment insurance cost only £334 per £10,000 to\r\nadminister as against the Government’s £1,000 per £10,000. It must be\r\nremembered, however, that the Government scheme has to cover multifarious\r\ntrades—organized, semi-organized and those not organized at all. But\r\nstill, after making all due allowance for that fact, there appears to be\r\nno question that a Government scheme does necessarily, from the inability\r\nto maintain close supervision, afford opportunities for waste and abuse\r\nwhich would not arise under a system of closer control.\r\n\r\n\r\nState Insurance\r\n\r\nThe details of the Government scheme have been described. The Labour\r\nExchanges have, in the face of great difficulties, performed the\r\nadministration with efficiency, but no one with experience of industrial\r\nconditions during the last two years could fail to realize that the\r\nadministration of unemployment insurance is not proper work to be\r\nundertaken by any Government Department. The proper function for the\r\nState is to see that all possible provision is made against unemployment\r\nbut not to undertake the work itself. In 1920 a Committee of Inquiry\r\nwas appointed by the Minister of Labour to inquire into and report upon\r\nthe Labour Exchanges. The majority of that Committee reported that “the\r\nadministration of unemployment insurance by industries on behalf of their\r\nown members was the most desirable system in the end, particularly from\r\nthe point of view of obtaining technical knowledge in the placing of\r\nworkmen, the creation of a corporate pride in each industry, and a sense\r\nof responsibility for unemployment in the industry.” The Geddes Committee\r\nhas recommended that this question should be further explored, and the\r\nMinister of Labour is taking steps to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\nInsurance by Industry or Industries\r\n\r\nThat industry should provide for its unemployment is obviously\r\nreasonable. The taxpayer has no control over industrial conditions,\r\nor over the wages which are paid, or the conditions of employment\r\nin operation, and in respect of such matters industry is under no\r\nresponsibility to the taxpayer. Should this provision be made by each\r\nindustry in particular or by industry as a whole? It would be impossible\r\nto form a scheme under which each industry would provide against its own\r\nunemployment. There are many industries, ranging from those most highly\r\norganized with employers and Trade Unions acting, and accustomed to act,\r\ncollectively and with some experience of the ratio of their unemployment,\r\ndown to industries which have no organization whatever nor any collective\r\nmachinery available for the operation of an insurance fund nor any\r\nknowledge of their own unemployment. It is only a highly organized\r\nindustry that could undertake to provide for its own unemployed, and not\r\nall highly organized industries, but merely a selected few—those which\r\nare clearly separated off from other industries. To all but the initiated\r\nit is surprising how industries are interlocked. If we take, for example,\r\nthe engineering industry, and industries like iron and steel, nuts and\r\nbolts, bicycle parts and innumerable others, there is great interchange\r\nof labour, especially unskilled. A large West-end store will be engaged\r\nin fifty to sixty different industries. How would its interests in each\r\nindustry be separated? There is no doubt that it is to the financial\r\nadvantage of a highly organized clearly demarcated industry to provide\r\nfor its own unemployment insurance as compared with participation in a\r\nState Scheme.\r\n\r\nSir Alfred Watson, the Government Actuary, before the Committee of\r\nInquiry on the Labour Exchanges, pointed out the great financial benefit\r\nit would be to the principal industries to provide their own unemployment\r\ninsurance, and referred to the large margin there would be available\r\nfor the actual costs of the benefits. In a most interesting pamphlet\r\npublished on “Unemployment Insurance,” Mr. Henry Lesser, the President of\r\nthe National Federation of Employees Approved Societies, states that in\r\none industrial undertaking employers and employed pay in respect of the\r\nNational Unemployment Insurance Scheme over £22,000 per year, but that in\r\nnormal times the persons employed in that particular firm do not receive\r\nin the aggregate in unemployment pay more than £800 a year, a case, he\r\nsays, which may be taken as typical of the whole of the industry in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nOne outstanding advantage which would result from each industry effecting\r\nits own unemployment insurance would be the feeling it must undoubtedly\r\nengender in the minds of both employers and Trade Unions of their\r\nresponsibility for the combined working of the industry, and the effect\r\nit is bound to have in producing a better spirit between the two parties\r\nand amongst the men, who will no longer feel that they are taken on and\r\ndischarged merely as it suits the interests of the firm. A thorough\r\ninvestigation should be made as to what industries could undertake their\r\nown unemployment insurance, and whether it is better that they should do\r\nso, or come into a general scheme of insurance by all industries. The\r\nordinary objection of employers and Trade Unions representing “good”\r\nindustries, i.e. those with a low rate of unemployment, is that they\r\nare paying for the “bad” industries with a high rate, but is not that\r\nrather the essence of insurance? It may well be that only insurance by\r\nall industries acting collectively is possible. If such turns out to be\r\nthe case, that plan should be adopted ready for carrying into practical\r\noperation on the approach of more normal times. Industries which rely\r\nmainly on casual labour are a more difficult proposition. Decasualization\r\nis essential, and that must be effected by some means of restricting the\r\nfree influx of labour into the industry, as has been done in the Dock\r\nLabour Scheme in Liverpool. The efficiency of the Liverpool method is\r\nundoubtedly due to the co-operation between the dock labour employers and\r\nthe Unions; it has been most strikingly successful. It affords a basis\r\nfor procedure in very many industries. There must, however, I am afraid,\r\nremain a residuum of unemployment insurance to be handled by the State,\r\nin the absence of any other authority, on the lines presumably of the\r\npresent National Unemployment Insurance Scheme, but it would be reduced\r\nto small proportions if all the great industries of the country were\r\nproviding for their own unemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\nReform of Present Out-Door Relief System\r\n\r\nIn connection with unemployment, the present system of Poor Law relief\r\nwants overhauling. The provision of relief by the Guardians (in addition\r\nto, or substitution for, unemployment insurance benefit) on varying\r\nstandards in different places throughout the country is extremely\r\nwasteful and disturbing to social harmony. If this is taken out of the\r\nhands of the Guardians, as has already been recommended by both the\r\nmajority and minority reports of the Poor-Law Commission, and committed\r\ninto the hands of some local authority—because local responsibility is\r\nessential for the spending of money raised by local rates—it would mark\r\nprogress of no uncertain kind. Absolute standardization is impossible,\r\nbecause of the varying social circumstances and indeed social outlook\r\nin different parts of the country, but, after allowing for this, much\r\ngreater approximation to uniformity could be secured.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnemployment Insurance by Firms\r\n\r\nWithout any doubt the best approach to insurance by industries or by\r\nindustry as a whole is to start with insurance by firms. An admirable\r\nbeginning has been made in this direction by the National Federation of\r\nEmployees Approved Societies—particulars of this scheme can be obtained\r\nfrom the Secretary to the Federation, c/o British Thomson-Houston Co.,\r\nLtd., Rugby—it is also described with great clearness by Mr. Lesser in\r\nthe pamphlet referred to on p. 260. The experience of the Federation\r\nis most instructive. In many works, before the days of National Health\r\nInsurance, there were sick clubs which provided for members unemployed\r\nthrough illness, benefits from a fund to which employers and employed\r\nalike contributed. Both employers and employed viewed, with considerable\r\nregret, the proposed absorption of these clubs into the new Approved\r\nSocieties established under the Health Insurance Act, and to obviate\r\nthat fate reconstituted their clubs with the approval of the Insurance\r\nCommissioners into “Works Societies,” and obtained official sanction\r\nfor these Societies to administer the State scheme. Later these Works\r\nSocieties decided to undertake the administration of unemployment benefit\r\nat their respective works under Section 17 of the Unemployment Insurance\r\nAct, 1920. There were three conditions precedent: first, that the Society\r\nmust provide for payment out of its own voluntary funds of an additional\r\nunemployment benefit equal to one-third of that payable under the\r\nAct—that is to say, if the State benefit was 15_s._ the Society must add\r\nto that at least another 5_s._ out of its private fund and so pay a total\r\nbenefit of 20_s._ The second stipulation was that the Society must have\r\na system for ascertaining the rates of wages and the general conditions\r\nof employment prevailing in all occupations in which its members were\r\nengaged; these particulars were always well-known, and there was not much\r\ndifficulty about that. The third requirement was that the Society should\r\nhave an effective system of ascertaining vacancies for employment—this\r\nmeant some organization distinct from the Labour Exchanges. Such an\r\norganization was finally obtained through the co-operation of the local\r\nChambers of Commerce, who receive from their associated firms particulars\r\nof vacancies which the Chambers send on to the different Works Societies.\r\nThe scheme works exceedingly well. It was first adopted by the South\r\nMetropolitan Gas Co., and later by the Gas Light and Coke Co., Messrs.\r\nDebenhams, the British Thomson-Houston Co., Ltd., Taylor Bros. & Co., J.\r\nT. & J. Taylor, Ltd., and a number of other firms. The Society acts as\r\nthe State’s agent with regard to paying out the State benefits, and in\r\naddition pays at the same time a supplementary benefit of one-third of\r\nthe State benefit, for which an extra contribution is generally levied\r\non the workers at the rate of 2_d._ per week, and most of the employers\r\ncontribute to the supplementary benefit fund. One cannot fail to be\r\nstruck in reading Mr. Lesser’s pamphlet by the extraordinary success\r\nof the Federation’s scheme in producing co-operation and good feeling\r\nbetween masters and men. With the experience which firms get through\r\nputting into operation a method of unemployment insurance of this kind,\r\nthe way is opened for the institution of a wider scheme of grouped firms,\r\nand ultimately for insurance by industry or industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYED\r\n\r\n1. CONTENTMENT IN INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Human Status of the Worker in Industry—The Slowness\r\n    of Ordinary Conciliation Machinery—The Whitley Councils\r\n    Scheme—Joint National and District Industrial Councils—Works’\r\n    Committees—The Slow Progress of Works’ Committees—The Success\r\n    of Works’ Committees on the Clyde—Executive Management a Matter\r\n    for Employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Human Status of the Worker\r\n\r\nThe next most pressing reform in our present industrial system is to\r\nsecure for the individual worker a definite status in industry. To\r\ndescribe what is intended is easier than to define it. At present the\r\nindividual worker complains that the government of industry is conducted\r\nby the employer entirely as the latter thinks fit. He calls it the\r\n“domination of capital”; he describes himself as treated with scant or no\r\nconsideration, and undoubtedly he draws all his industrial inspirations\r\nfrom an atmosphere in which there is little apparent development of his\r\nhuman personality. The worker is right and he is wrong. He forgets that\r\nthe conduct of industry to-day is not a matter in the uncontrolled hands\r\nof any employer. He loses sight of the fact that in all well-organized\r\nindustries the conditions of employment which prevail have been the\r\nmatter of extensive adjustment between the employers’ organizations and\r\nthe Trade Unions, negotiated, of course, centrally beyond the horizon of\r\nthe individual worker.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Slowness of Ordinary Conciliation Machinery\r\n\r\nThe real feeling that the worker is trying to express is his sense of\r\npersonal insignificance in a great factory, accentuated, when grievances\r\narise, by the difficulty, in large works, of securing prompt discussion\r\nof them between the workers and the management. All that can be done is\r\nfor the worker to report the matter to the shop steward of his particular\r\ncraft in the department, who will no doubt report it to the secretary\r\nof his Trade Union district committee. The latter will put it forward\r\nfor consideration by the committee and take their instructions upon it,\r\nand the committee will, in course of time, send down him or the district\r\ndelegate to the works to see the employer. A discussion will take place,\r\nthe results of which the district delegate will report back to the\r\ndistrict committee. If the matter is amicably settled there is an end\r\nof it; if, on the other hand, it still remains in dispute, the district\r\ncommittee may decide to refer it to the executive council of their Union.\r\nThe executive council will then remit it to the central organization of\r\nthe employers, to be considered by them at their next meeting. The matter\r\nmay be then adjusted, or it may be left over for discussion at one of\r\nthe periodical joint central conferences. While this ponderous machinery\r\nis functioning the individual worker is left face to face with the\r\nremembrance of his grievance, and it is not surprising that he gradually\r\nacquires a sense of inferiority and a feeling of being neglected, through\r\nhis ignorance that the mills of conciliation grind slowly. The object\r\nfirst and foremost must be to adapt existing, or provide new, machinery\r\nin all industries to enable grievances to be speedily discussed in the\r\nworks in which they arise. It may be found when they are investigated\r\nthat they involve some issue common to all the works in the district\r\nengaged in the same industry. Obviously, then, that is a matter to be\r\ndiscussed between the district employers and the district committees\r\nof the Trade Unions, or through the district conciliation machinery,\r\nwhatever it may be. In course of the district discussions it may be\r\nascertained that the matters of controversy have raised some national\r\nquestion, then, obviously, for the sake of industrial uniformity, these\r\nquestions should be considered nationally between the organizations\r\nrepresenting all the employers in the country engaged in the particular\r\nindustry and the Trade Unions representing the men, or through the\r\nappropriate national conciliation machinery.\r\n\r\nThese are the general lines along which, as Part II shows, industrial\r\nconciliation machinery has developed. In the highly organized industries,\r\nthere is machinery, district and national, but not as a rule works’\r\ncommittees. The drawback in all industries is the delay.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Whitley Councils Scheme\r\n\r\nThe want of such machinery became apparent in many imperfectly organized\r\nindustries in the early part of the war, and in October 1916, “the\r\nWhitley Committee” was appointed by the Prime Minister with the\r\nfollowing terms of reference:\r\n\r\n(1) To make and consider suggestions for securing a permanent improvement\r\nin the relations between employers and workmen.\r\n\r\n(2) To recommend means for securing that industrial conditions affecting\r\nthe relations between employers and workmen should be systematically\r\nreviewed by those concerned, with a view to improving conditions in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nOf this Committee the present Speaker of the House of Commons, the Right\r\nHon. J. H. Whitley, was Chairman. It comprised representatives of the\r\nemployers and also of the Trade Unions engaged in some of the great\r\nindustries. The Committee presented five reports recommending what is now\r\nknown as the Whitley Councils Scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoint National and District Industrial Councils\r\n\r\nIn its first Report (_Parliamentary Paper_, 1917, Cd. 8606) the Committee\r\nrecommended the establishment for each of the principal industries of a\r\ntriple form of organization, representative of employers and employed,\r\nconsisting of National Joint Councils, Joint District Councils and Works’\r\nCommittees, each of the three forms of organization being linked up with\r\nthe others, so as to constitute an organization covering the whole of\r\nthe trade, capable of considering and advising upon matters affecting\r\nthe welfare of the industry and giving to Labour a definite and enlarged\r\nshare in the discussion and settlement of industrial matters with which\r\nemployers and employed are jointly concerned, each Council and Committee\r\nexercising such powers and duties as are determined by negotiation\r\nbetween the employers and the Trade Unions in the industry in question.\r\n\r\nAs part of its second Report (_Parliamentary Paper_, 1918, Cd. 9002)\r\nthe Committee proposed for trades in which organization is weak or\r\nnon-existent the adoption of the system of Trade Boards, and for trades\r\nin which organization was considerable, but not yet comprehensive, a\r\nsystem of Joint Councils, with Government assistance, to be dispensed\r\nwith in each case as soon as these industries advanced to the stage\r\nwhen the full organization could successfully be created for them. The\r\nCommittee also proposed a scheme in its second Report under which the\r\nNational Joint Council of an industry, once it had agreed upon a minimum\r\nstandard of working conditions for those employed in the industry, could\r\nsecure the enforcement of those conditions either throughout a given\r\ndistrict or over the whole country.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorks’ Committees\r\n\r\nProminently in its third Report (_Parliamentary Paper_, 1918, Cd. 9085)\r\nthe Whitley Committee emphasized once more the need for the constitution\r\nin each factory or workshop, where the circumstances of the industry\r\npermitted, of a Works’ Committee, representative of the management and\r\nthe men and women employed, to meet regularly to consider questions\r\npeculiar to the individual factory or workshop which affected the life\r\nand comfort of the workers.\r\n\r\nIn the Committee’s fourth Report (_Parliamentary Paper_, 1918, Cd. 9099)\r\nit recommended the establishment of a standing Arbitration Tribunal\r\nto deal with cases where the two sides of a Joint Industrial Council\r\nhad failed to come to an agreement and wished to refer the dispute for\r\nsettlement by arbitration.\r\n\r\nThe far-sighted proposals of the Whitley Committee represent the\r\nmachinery that is necessary if the government of industry is to be a\r\nmatter of mutual arrangement between the employers and the employed.\r\nGreat progress has already been made in establishing Whitley Councils; in\r\nsome industries they have operated remarkably well, and have succeeded\r\nin conferring a very considerable measure of joint self-government on\r\nemployers and employed. But in other industries where they have been\r\nstarted they have not worked so satisfactorily. On paper no doubt the\r\nnumber of National Joint Industrial Councils which have been established\r\nappears large, and the number of Joint District Councils substantial,\r\nbut their effect in avoiding disputes in some industries is negligible.\r\nThe reason, in my opinion, is that too much attention has been paid to\r\nsetting up National Councils and too little to forming Works’ Committees.\r\nProgress would have been much more marked if employers generally had been\r\nprepared to press forward more enthusiastically with the constitution of\r\nWorks’ Committees—they are the crux of the position. It is they which\r\ndeal directly with the individual worker who is necessarily out of\r\npersonal touch with the Joint National or District Councils.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Slow Progress of Works’ Committees\r\n\r\nThere are several explanations of employers’ want of sympathy with\r\nWorks’ Committees. In a number of establishments where they were\r\nformed the workers used them to deal, not with matters in which the\r\nemployer and the employed were jointly interested, but with matters\r\nof executive responsibility solely appertaining to the employer. This\r\nwas done sometimes out of keenness, sometimes out of ignorance; in\r\nsome localities it was a definite attempt on the part of revolutionary\r\nelements to use these workshop committees as a means of acquiring the\r\ncontrol of the industry. Again, enforcements of discipline were treated\r\nas illustrations of the “domination of capital” and tabled by the workers\r\nas matters for joint agreement. In some works, it has been surprising\r\nto me how far employers have been able to go in discussing matters of\r\ndiscipline, even to the extent of making dismissals for infraction of\r\nworks’ rules a matter for consideration by the workshop committee. That,\r\nI am afraid, is a course which cannot be recommended. I have had some\r\nexperience of the endless agitation which simmered in one yard where that\r\nparticular plan was followed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Success of Works’ Committees on the Clyde\r\n\r\nIn the stormy days on the Clyde in the spring of 1916, I had, as Chairman\r\nof the Government Commission for Dilution of Labour, remarkable proofs\r\nof the extent to which workshop committees, when loyally supported by\r\nemployers, operate to create industrial contentment. Up to that time the\r\nskilled men in the engineering shops on the Clyde had firmly refused to\r\ncomply with the “Treasury” Agreements of March 1915, accepted on ballot\r\nby their own Trade Union, and declined absolutely to permit any woman to\r\nbe introduced for the purpose of doing work previously done by a man or\r\neven a boy. The Executive Council of the A.S.E. confessed their entire\r\ninability to persuade their Clyde members to comply with the Agreement,\r\nand left the matter to the Clyde District Committee. We, as a Commission,\r\nfound the Clyde District Committee willing to assist, but powerless.\r\nIt then occurred to us that the best way to achieve our purpose of\r\nintroducing women was to establish in each workshop a workshop committee\r\nconsisting of an equal number of workers and management. We explained the\r\nscheme of dilution to the committee, leaving it to be discussed between\r\nthe men on the one side and the management on the other, all information\r\nbeing given and objections, so far as possible, being met by us in the\r\ncourse of the discussion. The workers’ side of the committee would then\r\nreport to a mass meeting of the workers and come back in a day’s time\r\nto a further meeting of the committee, when adjustments, if necessary,\r\nwould be made by us in the scheme. The result was truly amazing; the men\r\nwho previously had been adamant against dilution soon realized there\r\nwas no desire on our part to force some cast-iron proposal down their\r\nthroats, and that there was a definite opportunity reserved to them as\r\nof right for discussing matters, for eliciting information on doubtful\r\naspects, for pointing out and securing a remedy for objectionable\r\nfeatures and for introducing safeguards for the protection of their\r\ncraft. Hostility softened into suspicion, suspicion mellowed into\r\nconfidence, and confidence in time begat co-operation. Almost insensibly\r\nthe scope of these committees widened by general consent, and other\r\nworkshop grievances, apart altogether from dilution, were submitted for\r\ndiscussion and disposed of in the same amicable way. The engineering\r\nemployers on the Clyde wholeheartedly supported the scheme, and a number\r\nof them voluntarily took the initiative in enlarging the sphere of\r\nmatters to be discussed. It should not be forgotten that this was in one\r\nof the most revolutionary districts of the country, where for their own\r\npurposes extremists had been long fomenting workshop grievances. When\r\nthose grievances were remedied in this way there was very little left for\r\nthe extremists to turn to their own ulterior ends, and the Clyde settled\r\ndown. After the Commission was dissolved in October 1916, by the Ministry\r\nof Munitions, which did not like to see an outside authority doing\r\nsuccessfully what it had previously failed to do, the influence for good\r\nof these committees rapidly declined under the hard hand of bureaucratic\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nAt first I had entertained fears of Trade Union hostility to workshop\r\ncommittees, because local delegates are apt to think that the discussion\r\nof workshop grievances is a matter entirely for them, which, if\r\nappropriated by a workshop committee, may impair the necessity for\r\ntheir official existence. This difficulty, however, we surmounted in a\r\nvery simple way. The committee consisted as a rule of seven or eight\r\nmembers elected by the workers in the shop, and an equal number of the\r\nrepresentatives of the management. Notice of any meeting of the committee\r\nand of the agenda before the committee would be sent to the district\r\ndelegate of the Union concerned, who would be invited ex-officio, if he\r\ncared, to attend and take part in the proceedings. As a rule the delegate\r\ninvariably did attend, and his presence was most helpful.\r\n\r\nIn the course of six months’ work the Clyde Commission established nearly\r\n200 workshop committees which met each week, and had the satisfaction\r\nof seeing them dispose of workshop grievances and other works disputes\r\nin a harmonious, business-like and effective manner. It produced the\r\nbest possible feeling among the men; they felt—as many of them told me\r\npersonally—they were no longer under the heel of the foreman, but had\r\nan opportunity of putting their complaints fully before the management,\r\nbeing called, of course, as witnesses by the workers’ side of the\r\ncommittee. They felt, they said, that their labour was being no longer\r\ntreated as merely raw material in industry, and that they had at last\r\nattained a human status. This, however, we did insist upon, that a worker\r\nhad to go through the constitutional shop procedure for disposing of his\r\ngrievance before it could be brought up at a meeting of the committee; in\r\nother words, if shop procedure provided for the question being dealt with\r\nby the foreman with an appeal from him to the manager, that it should\r\nbe exhausted before the committee could take the matter up. In the same\r\nway the worker had to exhaust his Trade Union procedure, reporting the\r\nmatter, it may be, to his shop steward, who would follow the progress of\r\nthe controversy in the accustomed manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nExecutive Management a Matter for Employers\r\n\r\nThe cause of what I hope is only a temporary stoppage in the progress\r\nof Joint Councils and Works’ Committees is due to the fact that extreme\r\nsections of Labour have taken the view that these Councils and Committees\r\nseriously interfere with their projects of bringing industry to an\r\nend, so as to enable the workers to acquire control of it, and have,\r\ntherefore, instigated the workers in certain districts to advance demands\r\ngoing to the very root of the employer’s right and responsibility to\r\nmanage his business, which do not admit of discussion. The employers\r\nrightly have objected to this. But for the way in which moderate workmen\r\nhave unwittingly lent themselves to these tactics, there is no doubt\r\nthat the scheme for Works’ Committees would have made greater headway.\r\nTo give an actual illustration: One of our mammoth liners, in shipyard\r\nafter being repaired, required a few hours’ overtime on the part of six\r\nfitters to enable her to go to her home port to load for departure. The\r\nfitters refused to work overtime until the matter was discussed between\r\ntheir shop steward and the management; a discussion took place, the\r\nformer would not agree, and insisted on convening his workshop committee\r\nin a couple of days. The ship was all this time being detained, and\r\neventually had to sail, as she could wait no longer, but as a result of\r\nthe delay, she missed the tide at her home port. While a limitation on\r\nthe total amount of overtime to be worked per working week is a matter\r\nfor legitimate agreement between management and men, when and how the\r\novertime is to be worked is obviously a question for the management.\r\nThe Whitley machinery is admirable, but however excellent it may be, it\r\ncan do nothing unless there is the right spirit on both sides—a spirit\r\nof compromise and mutual endeavour to arrive at some fair and equitable\r\nbasis of self-government, leaving it to the employer to manage his works\r\nin accordance with the principles that have been agreed. Labour cannot\r\nseek to settle the principles by negotiation, and in addition manage the\r\nworks. No employer claims to dictate what the principles shall be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYED\r\n\r\n1. CONTENTMENT IN INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n    (_c_) Remuneration of the Worker—Uniform National\r\n    Wages—Wage-Relationships among the Workers—Wages and the\r\n    Community—Are Higher Wages Practicable?—The Settlement of\r\n    Wages—Systems of Remuneration—What is a Fair Wage?—Other\r\n    Essentials to Industrial Contentment.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Remuneration of the Worker\r\n\r\nContentment in industry depends next on a sound and equitable policy\r\nfor remuneration of the workers. That implies the summary rejection of\r\nall attempts to fix wages on abstract formulae which pay no regard to\r\nthe circumstances of an industry, or conditions affecting the marketing\r\nof the product. If we adopt socialistic nomenclature and call the\r\nremuneration of the workers “pay,” and assume elimination of the private\r\nemployer, and each industry conducted under “democratic control,” even\r\nthen the gradation of pay between different classes of workers, the\r\nrate of pay of each class, the relation between the general standard\r\nof pay in one as compared with other industries would depend entirely\r\non the same circumstances as now, and, if the concrete results of past\r\nindustrial experience are to be disregarded, would be in each case a\r\nmatter for experimentation, and for practical adjustment and not for\r\npseudo-mathematical solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nUniform National Wages\r\n\r\nOne of the demands of workers in many industries which, before the war,\r\npaid in different districts rates of wages varying according to local\r\neconomic circumstances, is for uniform national wage rates. This is a\r\nresult of the war. There was, during the war, no time to consider the\r\nwage-circumstances of individual works—the pressing need was munitions at\r\nany price—hence Government Departments responsible for production were\r\ncompelled to treat wages in industries under their control, especially\r\nthose in which there had been no pre-war defined district practice,\r\non a more or less uniform national basis. Thus, substantially the same\r\nstandard, as distinct from minimum, rate of wages for the same grade of\r\nworkers came in time to operate generally throughout the country, in all\r\nworks in a particular munitions industry. In some of the more highly\r\norganized industries the addition of the same war advance preserved\r\ndistrict differentials of the same pre-war nominal amount, but the\r\npre-war ratios of the district wages to one another were greatly reduced.\r\nSo workmen in a particular district, where, for economic reasons, wages\r\nhad been lower than in other districts, found themselves on much the\r\nsame wage-level as workmen in the highest pre-war rated district. A\r\ndifference of 5_s._ between 35_s._ and 30_s._ per week is very different\r\nfrom 5_s._ between 80_s._ and 75_s._ Naturally, the worker will not\r\nwillingly surrender that position; hence the claim to-day in many\r\nindustries for standard national rates. It is an impracticable demand\r\nunder ordinary commercial conditions, save in exceptional cases where you\r\nhave one employer running all works in an industry, as the Government\r\ndid munitions during the war, or different employers each possessing\r\nbalanced undertakings which comprise establishments both above and below\r\naverage efficiency. The demand for standardization is illustrated in the\r\nrailwayman’s wage settlement; numerous classes of men (excluding drivers\r\nand firemen) previously in railway service have been reduced to a small\r\nnumber of grades, and the individual in those grades receives, generally\r\nspeaking, one of three descending national rates of pay according as his\r\nwork is in the London area, one of the provincial towns, or in a rural\r\npart of the country. Sailors’ and stokers’ wages are also standardized,\r\nthe same rates of pay for the same class of man being paid in vessels in\r\nthe same trade category. It is obvious, however, that neither railways\r\nnor shipping nor docks are analogous to industries consisting of an\r\nenormous number of widely different concerns. On the other hand, it is\r\nquite practicable to have uniform national conditions of employment,\r\novertime, night-work, Sunday-work, etc., and in many industries there is\r\nsuch national uniformity.\r\n\r\n\r\nWage-Relationships among the Workers\r\n\r\nThe war destroyed the delicate pre-war wage-relationship between the\r\ndifferent classes of skilled, semi-skilled, and unskilled labour—in some\r\ncases the new relationship is a complete inversion of the old. This was\r\npartly the result of Government Departments concerned in production—the\r\nAdmiralty, War Office, Ministry of Munitions—advancing wages of men under\r\ntheir control independently and without reference to one another, in\r\nsome cases actually enticing men to their employment; partly of strong\r\nsectional Trade Union pressure, and partly of the celebrated 12½ per\r\ncent, bonus to time-workers, and 7½ per cent. bonus to piece-workers.\r\nSince the war, the want of balance has been aggravated by the action of\r\nemployers and Trade Unions in industries supplying a national necessity,\r\ne.g. building, whereby wages were so raised that unskilled men were\r\npaid more than skilled men in a trade like engineering. There is no\r\nmore active cause of industrial discontent. As an illustration of how\r\nit operates, at the Dockers’ Inquiry, the Transport Workers’ Federation\r\nprotested against any comparison between dockers’ wages and those of\r\nother workers—they termed it a “capitalistic device” to deprive dockers\r\nof their rightful advance. The Transport Workers were members of the\r\nTriple Alliance; the railwaymen were also members. A few weeks later the\r\nrailwaymen were claiming before their Central Wages Board an increase in\r\nwage because the dockers had obtained a minimum wage of 16s. per day. It\r\nis therefore vital to get back to, and as far as possible preserve, the\r\npre-war wage relationships.\r\n\r\n\r\nWages and the Community\r\n\r\nPublic opinion is beginning to insist, as it ought to do, on recognition\r\nof the interests of the consuming community, which in the past have been\r\nwholly ignored. If an increase in wages in an industry is, and can be,\r\nsecured by an increase in price, as when the output is a necessity, the\r\nworkers in that industry benefit at the expense of the workers in other\r\nindustries, and of the consumers generally. In other words, the public\r\npays, as in the case of housing. If an all-round increase in wages in all\r\nindustries is financed by a general increase in prices, then all prices\r\nare higher, and the commodity purchasing power of the increased wages is\r\nno greater than that of the wages before increase, and again the public\r\nsuffers from the general rise in prices. Already a beginning has been\r\nmade in recognizing the interests of the community in placing public\r\nrepresentatives upon the Railway National Wages Board.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre Higher Wages Practicable?\r\n\r\nIt is essential to realize the practical difficulties in the way of\r\nthe workers getting the higher wages which all would like to see them\r\nreceive. There was a Census of Production in 1907 which included all the\r\nmanufacturing industries and mining, and covered half the wage-earners\r\nin the United Kingdom. It ascertained the “net output” for each industry\r\nfor the year by estimating the selling value of the gross product, and\r\nsubtracting therefrom expenditure on raw materials, including the product\r\nof other industries which were further worked up, and fuel and some other\r\nitems. The net output thus obtained is obviously for each industry the\r\nonly fund from which first, wages, salaries, interest on capital, rent,\r\nroyalties and profits are, or can be, paid, and secondly, taxes, rates,\r\ndepreciation, advertisement and sales expenses. Professor Bowley, in his\r\n_The Division of the Product of Industry_, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1919,\r\ntakes the total net output of £712,000,000 for the industries covered\r\nby the Census of 1907, and works out how much of it should be allocated\r\nagainst the first set of items. I set out below in tabular form his\r\nresults (pp. 37 and 52):\r\n\r\n                                                     £.

Supposing half of the £133,000,000 had been handed over, the total\r\naverage earnings of men fully employed (including tradesmen) would have\r\nbeen 35_s._ 2_d._ per week. But even to have handed over half, would,\r\nby reason of the great disparity between the profit-earning power per\r\nman employed of different firms in the same industry, have resulted in\r\nclosing down many of the less profitable concerns. These figures show\r\nconclusively that in industry, as a whole, though there may be exceptions\r\nin certain particular industries, the ability to pay higher permanent\r\nwages depends upon greater and more efficient production.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Settlement of Wages\r\n\r\nWages and conditions of employment must always be matters of collective\r\nbargaining between employers and employed and not for superimposition by\r\nGovernment upon either or both of them. In my view, national settlement\r\nof wages and conditions in an industry is essential to wage stability. A\r\nnational settlement does not, however, involve a uniform national wage.\r\nComplete discussion and national settlement entail for each industry\r\nthe organization of all the employers into one effective federation,\r\nand of all the workers, not necessarily into one Union, but into Unions\r\nwhich are embraced in one executive federation. Only where responsible\r\nrepresentative and disciplined federations of employers and workers\r\nexist in an industry can there be effective national negotiation of\r\nwages questions, or in industries in which Whitley Councils exist,\r\nbetween the two sides of the Council. I look forward to the time when\r\nthe organization in each industry for the settlement of all industrial\r\nconditions will be developed into an organization consisting of\r\nrepresentatives of (1) employers; (2) administrative and technical and\r\nsupervisory personnel; (3) Trade Unions, and (4) consumers. Questions\r\naffecting the industry as a whole would be settled by all four sections;\r\nquestions, e.g. of wages, by the representatives of the employers, Trade\r\nUnions and consumers. If a wage agreement is negotiated in any industry\r\nproviding for excessive wages and therefore high costs of production and\r\nhigh prices, is it to be unchallengeable when the industry is a public\r\nnecessity? There were many such agreements made during and immediately\r\nafter the war. I see no way of reviewing such agreements when once made;\r\nall attempts by Government to do so under the Munitions of War Acts were\r\nunsuccessful. The only practicable method of safeguarding the consuming\r\npublic is to have, as I suggest, efficient representatives of the public\r\npresent at, and entitled to take an active part in, the joint conferences\r\nof federated employers and Unions when wages are being negotiated, as on\r\nthe Railway National Wages Boards.\r\n\r\n\r\nSystems of Remuneration\r\n\r\nNo one can dogmatize and say what system of industrial remuneration\r\nshould be adopted, whether time, piece-work—collective or\r\nindividual—premium-bonus, bonus on output, profit-sharing, or\r\nco-partnership. That all depends upon the conditions of the industry, its\r\npeculiar psychology, especially its past history; it must always be a\r\nmatter for negotiation. But I am the strongest believer in a fair system\r\nof payment by results, as being, under proper safeguards, the best for\r\nthe worker, the employer and the consumer. A steel worker or boilermaker\r\nwill swear by it; a carpenter or joiner calls it “the device of the\r\ndevil.” Hence my reference to industrial psychology.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Fair Wage?\r\n\r\nWages are, and can only be, payment for work done and services rendered\r\nby the “wages staff.” There must always be a maximum limit to wages and a\r\nminimum. The employers’ maximum is a wage beyond which any advance, with\r\nother costs of production remaining constant, would prevent the marketing\r\nof the product at a commercial profit commensurate with the nature of the\r\nenterprise. The theoretical minimum is a “living wage,” i.e. bare cost\r\nof subsistence, but the Trade Union minimum wage, which is the practical\r\nminimum in industry, is much higher than the subsistence wage. It is a\r\nwage which in the particular industry provides for subsistence for the\r\nworker and his or her dependants, including therein food, rent, fuel,\r\nlight, clothing, fares, Trade Union subscriptions, etc., and reasonable\r\nenjoyment and recreation. Trade Union minimum rates for different trades\r\nvaried before the war from one another by “vocational differentials.”\r\nA skilled man’s rate exceeded that of an unskilled man by a recognized\r\nexcess; the excess is the trade differential in respect of the skill\r\nrequired of the particular tradesman, the length of apprenticeship\r\nnecessary to acquire it, the nature of the occupation and so forth. The\r\nhigher rate of the skilled man is naturally reflected, as statistics\r\nshow, in a higher standard of living. The whole problem in arriving at\r\na fair wage is to determine at what point, if any, between the existing\r\nTrade Union minimum and the employers’ maximum, the wage ought to be\r\nfixed, in justice to the workers, employers and the public.\r\n\r\nBy way of preliminary I would emphasize that no fair wage can be\r\nfixed on any basis of a priori reasoning. It involves constructing a\r\ntheoretical household budget, adopting an empirical standard of life,\r\nwith no relation whatsoever to the normal circumstances of any section\r\nof the industrial community, ignoring economic conditions, and assuming\r\nthat industry can or ought to pay a sufficient wage to maintain that\r\nstandard. That is the fatal method of the doctrinaire. The usual\r\nprocedure is for the Trade Unions to demand an increased wage, and swear\r\nby all the gods that the employers can easily pay it. The employers then\r\nassert with equal emphasis their inability to pay any increase. Sometimes\r\na compromise is reached and sometimes not. There should be, and indeed\r\nis, a better method of procedure.\r\n\r\nFirst, there ought to be ascertained the wages which the industry is\r\neconomically able to pay at the then prevailing market prices for its\r\nproduct; we may conveniently call them “ability wages.” They cannot be\r\ndetermined by picking out and assuming as typical—a frequent stratagem\r\nof Labour—individual firms which are making substantial profits. The\r\nindustry must be taken on a national, it may be sometimes on a district\r\nbasis, extreme cases at both ends of the scale ruled out, and a proper\r\nestimate struck on methods of accountancy, making due allowance for the\r\ntrade outlook and for all the expenses and risks present and prospective,\r\nwhich, from the conditions of the industry in question, fall upon the\r\nemployers. Labour insists on the Trade Union rate of wages being paid\r\nby all firms, whether making large profits or none at all. To consider\r\ntherefore the industry as a whole is equitable. Employers making\r\nexceptional profits cannot be taken as norms for wages; so far as their\r\ngains are contrary to public policy, they can only be dealt with by a\r\n“wise and wary Chancellor of the Exchequer.” That an “ability to pay”\r\nestimate can be prepared in respect of an industry by competent joint\r\naccountants on a basis convincing to Labour has more than once come\r\nprominently within my own practical experience. The great point is to\r\nprove to the workers that they are getting a fair share of the product of\r\nindustry under its then existing conditions. It is much more important to\r\nsatisfy them on that point than to pay them a high wage. If they get a\r\nhigher wage than the industry can pay, and are not satisfied, they will\r\nfirmly believe that a still higher wage could and ought to be paid. There\r\nis only one way to prove the equity of the wage—to put all the cards on\r\nthe table, and show the Trade Union representatives at the conference\r\nwhat the exact conditions of the industry are, and what are the maximum\r\nwages which the industry as a whole can pay.\r\n\r\nSecondly, an exact statement is required of the wages paid in other\r\nindustries to workers comparable with the workers in the industry in\r\nquestion—these may be termed “comparable wages.” They are obtainable\r\nfrom statistics compiled by the Ministry of Labour, but not published in\r\ncollated form.\r\n\r\nThere are in practice two objects to achieve. First, to ensure that each\r\ngrade of worker gets a fair wage which corresponds to the “ability wage,”\r\nand secondly, to try and keep the wages of workers in one industry in\r\nproper wage-relationship with the wages of comparable workers in other\r\nindustries. If the existing wages are less than the “ability wages,” and\r\nthe latter are either equal to, or less than, the comparable wages, there\r\nought to be an advance of the existing wages up to the ability level,\r\nand, in my view, a further advance beyond ability level towards, but\r\nnot exceeding, the comparable wages-level, if the circumstances of the\r\nindustry are such, as for example, in respect of foreign competition,\r\nthat the market price of the product can be increased by the necessary\r\namount. It is so essential for the harmony of industry that the wages\r\nof comparable workers should be generally on the same level. There\r\nis no difficulty in practice in saying who are comparable workers.\r\nIndustrial experience and tradition have firmly settled that. In the\r\ncase, comparatively rare in practice, where the level of ability wages\r\nis higher than the level of comparable wages, other considerations\r\narise. Some employers contend that to pay in one industry that can\r\nafford it a higher rate of wages than in comparable industries that\r\ncannot afford it is to upset the equilibrium of wages in those latter\r\nindustries, and incite the workers in them to ask for the same wages\r\nrates, thus involving a charge upon the whole or a section of the public\r\nforming the consumers of the product of those industries with the usual\r\nresults. Other employers assert that comparable wages are the criterion\r\nof fair wages, and as employers have to stand the risk of paying Trade\r\nUnion wages when profits are not adequate, so, therefore, employers,\r\nwhen profits are exceptional, should be entitled to retain what remains\r\nafter comparable wages are paid. I do not see why the employer should be\r\nentitled to appropriate in such a case the difference between the ability\r\nwages and the comparable wages. In my view, if an industry is shown by a\r\njoint cost investigation to be able to pay wages which are higher than\r\ncomparable wages, the amount of the proceeds of the industry beyond the\r\nsum necessary to pay wages at comparable rates should be divided equally\r\nbetween employers and workers and consumers—in the case of the latter by\r\na reduction in price. The workers thus secure a share in the prosperity\r\nof the industry.\r\n\r\nSome wage complexities due to the war urgently need adjustment. Flat\r\nadditions as war bonuses on piece-work or tonnage-rates are unsettling\r\nanomalies; they should be incorporated in new piece—or tonnage—rates.\r\nTheir existence hinders output. War advances and war bonuses; which,\r\nthough originally different, are now in practice indistinguishable,\r\nshould, so far as not withdrawn, be merged into the permanent rate or\r\nprice—in one-half of industry they have already been merged—difference of\r\ntreatment only causes unrest. It cannot be too strongly emphasized that\r\nhigh rates of wages do not necessarily mean high earnings—they frequently\r\nmean no earnings and no work. Increasing the productive efficiency of\r\nlabour does increase the ability of industry to pay. Such alone is the\r\none sure road to higher earnings.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Essentials to Industrial Contentment\r\n\r\nThere should be open to the workers in this country an opportunity of\r\nrising, that is, of transfer from the wages side to the salaried side\r\nof the staff as is afforded by American employers. Why there should be\r\nsuch reluctance among so many English employers to promote men from the\r\nwages side I have never appreciated. During the war I had a large number\r\nof workmen under me at the Admiralty, who, after the war, were appointed\r\nto responsible positions on the administrative side of industry in the\r\nestablishments of some broad-minded employers, and have abundantly\r\njustified their selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYED\r\n\r\n2. CO-OPERATION IN INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n    The Workers’ Own Resort to Co-operation—The Marxian Argument\r\n    against Co-operation—Some Workshop Applications—The Marxian\r\n    Fallacy of the Origin of Capital—The Marxian Fallacy of\r\n    Value—The Need of Sympathy in Workshop Life—The Need of Strict\r\n    Justice—The Money Value of Sympathy in Industry—The Sympathetic\r\n    Handling of Labour a Special Art—An Illustration of its\r\n    Successful Application.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe establishment of co-operation in industry between employers and\r\nemployed is a matter almost entirely of the mind and spirit; it depends\r\nupon the elimination of the mutual suspicion that at present exists;\r\nit involves the creation of confidence; it entails the dissipation of\r\ncertain economic fallacies that obsess the workers and also unprogressive\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Workers’ Own Resort to Co-operation\r\n\r\nLabour thoroughly well recognizes the productive power of the spirit of\r\nco-operation. In certain trades men work in squads, and the members of\r\nthe squad share in agreed proportions the total price for the squad’s\r\ncollective work. Many shops are paid on the output bonus system or on\r\na “fellowship” basis. Under such conditions the earnings of the squad\r\nor shop, within the limits fixed for normal output, depend on the full\r\nco-operation of each member of the squad or shop. Co-operation is then\r\nrecognized as a moral duty. It is almost invariably afforded without\r\nstint, if not it is sternly exacted. Many skilled men also paid on\r\noutput are assisted by semi-skilled or unskilled “helpers” paid a fixed\r\ntime wage, irrespective of output. Although the increased efforts of\r\nthe “helpers” result in increased earnings only for the skilled men, in\r\ngeneral co-operation is usually forthcoming from the “helpers,” and if\r\nnot it is unconditionally demanded. There is no difficulty in identifying\r\nthe doctrines to which the workers appeal in justification of their\r\npresent attitude of non-co-operation with employers—they all come from\r\nMarxian Socialism. They are encountered everywhere in workshop, Trade\r\nUnion branch and district committee, and form the foundations of belief\r\namongst industrial democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Marxian Argument against Co-operation\r\n\r\nThough it is not possible to crystallize the Marxian doctrines with\r\nabsolute precision of language into a few lines of print, they may be\r\nstated in simple words, with tolerable accuracy, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Production is the process of applying labour-force to raw\r\n    material, and the exchange or market value of the commodity\r\n    which is the product is created by the labour-force expended by\r\n    the labourer in working. That value, which solely results from\r\n    the labour so expended, is measured by the time occupied by the\r\n    labourer upon the production of the newly-created commodity in\r\n    question. The labourer is paid by his employer a wage which\r\n    represents the ‘exchange value’ of his ‘labour-force.’ But the\r\n    employer has obtained the ‘use-value’ of the labour-force,\r\n    and disposes of the newly-created product in the market at a\r\n    selling price which, after making allowance for the costs of\r\n    production before and after the application of labour-force,\r\n    is higher than the wage paid to the labourer. The excess is\r\n    ‘surplus value.’ This surplus value in primitive industry is\r\n    appropriated wholly by the employer, but in industry more\r\n    highly developed is apportioned out among the different\r\n    classes of capitalists in the shape of ground rent, interest,\r\n    manufacturers’ profits, and commercial profit.”\r\n\r\nIn the doctrines of Marx there are three fundamental propositions: the\r\nfirst, that money is the primary form of capital; the second, that the\r\nvalue of a commodity is measured by the amount of labour expended upon\r\nit; the third, that the capitalist buys the use-value of a day’s labour\r\nin exchange for its market value, pocketing the surplus value, which is\r\nthe difference. As long as we allow these theories to remain victorious,\r\nindustry to-day is merely a process by which the capitalist constitutes\r\nhimself the conduit-pipe to the sale-room for the workman’s labour, and\r\nas the latter passes through his hands filches for himself the “surplus\r\nvalue.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Workshop Applications\r\n\r\nAs I write I have beside me a mass of leaflets, pamphlets and writings,\r\nwhich came into my possession during my recent industrial work, all\r\nreeking with this pernicious Marxianism. Some extracts from the _Red\r\nCatechism_, handed to me by way of argument in a shipyard, will give an\r\nidea of the doctrines:\r\n\r\n  Who creates all wealth?            The working-class.\r\n\r\n  Who are the workers?               Men who work for wages and receive\r\n                                       only a portion of what they earn,\r\n                                       the other part going to keep the\r\n                                       idle classes.\r\n\r\n  Who creates all poverty?           Our capitalistic society.\r\n\r\n  What is a wage-slave?              A person who works for a wage, and\r\n                                       gives all he earns to a capitalist.\r\n\r\n  What proportion does a wage-slave  On the average about a fourth.\r\n    receive of what he earns?\r\n\r\n  What is an exploiter?              One who employs a man and makes him\r\n                                       produce three or four times the\r\n                                       amount he receives in wages.\r\n\r\n  How do capitalists become rich?    By employing labour and exploiting it.\r\n\r\n  The question of merit does not     No. It is only used as a hypocritical\r\n    enter into the reward of           subterfuge to hide the robbery of\r\n    capital, then?                     labour.\r\n\r\nThese are only a few quotations, the list could be amplified enormously.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Marxian Fallacy of the Origin of Capital\r\n\r\nThe Marxian proposition that money is the first form of capital is a\r\ndiscordant and disruptive delusion. Marx declared that all capital was\r\nderived from the profits obtained by paying labour less than the value\r\nit created. On this hypothesis the capitalist assists in no way in the\r\nbusiness of production. He is in the position of reaping what he has not\r\nsown. He is a bandit who holds up to ransom the whole world of workmen.\r\nHe lets labourers off with their lives, that is to say, with wages just\r\nsufficient for their subsistence and the reproduction of their species,\r\nthus securing the maintenance of a supply of labour, on condition that\r\nthe labourers hand over to him practically the entire value of their\r\nlabour. As long as such doctrines are taught to the young worker and are\r\naccepted by the old, of what good is it to prate about co-operation? It\r\nis about as sensible to advocate co-operation between a host and its\r\nparasite, between a vampire and its prey, between a highway robber and\r\nhis victim. Yet that is the vain task on which so many eminent persons\r\nare now wasting their eloquence.\r\n\r\nThe first essential is boldly and openly to challenge this Marxian\r\ndoctrine of the parasitic character of capital. There will never be,\r\nthere cannot be, co-operation between capital and Labour until Labour has\r\nlearned what capital is and the function it plays in production. Labour\r\nis ready to learn. I have found it possible to sustain the interest of\r\nworkmen while explaining that capital consists primarily of things that\r\nare not money, of goods upon which people subsist while producing other\r\ngoods, of factories, machinery, and raw material; that capital is a\r\ndefinite agent in production, capable of application, not merely by the\r\nconventional employer, but by every man; that it is something which,\r\nwhen used in production, is consumed, so that he who adventures it must\r\npossess such experience and judgment as will enable him to surmount the\r\nrisk of loss, and obtain a return sufficient to replace the capital\r\nthat has been consumed, and to recompense the lender for his thrift and\r\nremunerate himself for the services he has rendered and the risk to\r\nwhich he has been subjected. These particular aspects of capital, from\r\ntheir very novelty and unexpectedness, catch the immediate attention\r\nof Labour, so much so that in some districts the workmen, of their own\r\naccord, arranged meetings and invited me specially to discuss with them\r\nthe character and function of capital in modern industry and the extent\r\nto which Labour was dependent upon it.\r\n\r\nBut realities must be faced. There is no good in evading the fact that\r\nwhile capital is essential and of incalculable benefit to humanity, it\r\ncan, at the same time, like any other human possession, be used so as to\r\ncause inconvenience, injustice, distress, degradation, death. In short,\r\nthe use of capital may be socially beneficent, or it may be maleficent,\r\nanti-social. The invariable example which the workman adduces of its\r\nanti-social use is “profiteering” in many of its accustomed forms. It\r\nis a great misfortune that there is no precise term in use to describe\r\nthe particular function of capital as an agent in production. Aristotle\r\ndistinguished on arbitrary principles which he enunciated, and derived\r\nfrom the conditions of his time, between the natural beneficial use of\r\nwealth, which he calls “economics,” and the unnatural abuse of wealth,\r\nwhich he calls “chrematistics.” His principles are out of date, the\r\nterminological distinction which he attempted was sound. This is what\r\nhappens always in industrial discussion: employers, thinking of the\r\nbeneficent function played by capital in production, emphasize the\r\ndependence of Labour on capital—Labour, thinking of the anti-social uses\r\nof capital, and reasoning from the particular to the general, retorts\r\nthat capital is the cause of all Labour’s troubles. If both employers\r\nand workers could, by appropriate terms, get down to discussing the same\r\nthing, there would be substantial prospect of agreement; to-day there is\r\nnone.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Marxian Fallacy of Value\r\n\r\nThe next notion in the workman’s mind subversive of co-operation is his\r\nidea, derived from Marx, that “the value of a commodity is the amount\r\nof abstract human labour embodied in it.” If this be true, as so many\r\nworkmen now fervently believe, it follows that the employer contributes\r\nnothing whatever to the value of the manufactured product, and that\r\nthe only value-producing agency is labour. In truth neither workman\r\nnor employer creates value; both unite to perform services or produce\r\nthings which other circumstances, e.g. demand, cause to be of value, and\r\nthey do so because of that value. But the material point is that the\r\nMarxian doctrine rules out co-operation. Logically, it implies that the\r\nonly possible remedy for the present lot of the worker consists in the\r\ncomplete demolition of the present organization of industry. The worker\r\nwho accepts the Marxian theory of value, with its corollary theory of\r\nsurplus value, is a weak-kneed individual and a traitor to his brethren,\r\nif he be cajoled for a moment into co-operating with his employer, or\r\nif he hesitates to fight whole-heartedly for the eradication of the\r\nemployer, root and branch, from the industrial system.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty I have experienced in attacking this Marxian heresy is the\r\ncommon one which confronts any opponent of a popular doctrine accepted on\r\nfaith and not on logic. A reasoned explanation of the fallacy is often\r\nnot understood, a striking refutation is regarded as an extreme instance\r\nto which no reasonable person would ever suggest that the principle\r\napplied. When I have put the classic case of a man who discovers a\r\nprecious stone, picks it up and finds it is worth, say, £50, and have\r\nsuggested that the labour-force exerted by the finder in reaching down\r\nand lifting up the stone and carrying it to a purchaser cannot surely be\r\nthe sole cause of its value, the answer has at once been made: “That is a\r\ncase of raw material, and not a manufactured article.” I have then taken\r\nthe case of some manufactured article like “pigs” or “ingots.” These when\r\nmade were of a certain value, but they were put into store as against a\r\nrising market and became, subsequently, of greater value. According to\r\nMarx, the magnitude of the value of any commodity is determined by the\r\namount of the labour socially necessary for its production and embodied\r\nin it under the normal conditions of production, and with the average\r\ndegree of skill and intensity prevalent at the time. This amount of\r\nlabour, in the case of the “pigs” and “ingots,” was the amount expended\r\nwhen they were first made, but since then, without the expenditure of any\r\nmore labour, their value has greatly increased. The increase in value\r\ncannot obviously be attributed to the addition of “abstract”or any other\r\nkind of labour.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising how many workmen have learned quite glibly the outlines\r\nof the Marxian value and surplus value argument, and can express it by\r\nrote in flawless Marxian terminology. Even accepting it, as it has\r\nbeen so truly described, as “the greatest intellectual mare’s nest of\r\nthe last century,” without any question it is an argument that has to\r\nbe seriously considered. It must be driven by economic education out\r\nof the workers’ list of cherished convictions. No good will come of\r\ntreating it with flippancy, or pouring ridicule upon it. I made it my\r\npractice to take up the argument stage by stage, emphasize what appeared\r\nto me to be the flaws, and then finish off with a number of practical\r\nworkshop illustrations of cases where the argument fails egregiously\r\nto hold water. To be convincing, and to drive each point well home,\r\ntakes a considerable amount of time, but it is well worth it. Few\r\npersons appreciate the extent to which this Marxian sophistry prevents\r\nachievement of the co-operative ideal in industry.\r\n\r\nThere is just one word of warning necessary. According to Marx, the\r\nworkman receives from the employer the exchange value of his labour-force\r\nor power on handing over to the employer its use-value. Marx maintained,\r\nand unfortunately in the past there has been much to add force to his\r\ncontention, that Labour in return received a wage no more than equal\r\nto “bare subsistence” or “bare cost of production of labour-power.” In\r\nmany cases the past level of wages cannot be defended, and it would be\r\nfoolish to try and vindicate it. But this much can be said, real wages\r\nhave risen very considerably since Marx’s day, and without any overthrow\r\nof the industrial system. Such a result is absolutely in contradiction of\r\nhis prophecy, and at variance with his doctrine. It strongly suggests the\r\nwisdom of constructive evolution as opposed to destructive revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Need of Sympathy in Workshop Life\r\n\r\nThe power of these economic fallacies is enormously reinforced by the\r\ninjustice and want of sympathy that too often surrounds the industrial\r\nrelationship between employers and employed. That atmosphere is due to\r\nold-fashioned employers holding fast to crude individualistic notions\r\nof industry, to the idea that a workman is the animated machine—ἔμψυχον\r\nὄργανον—of the Greek philosophers—an “economic unit” without soul,\r\nsensibility, ideals or aspirations, who still labour under the\r\ndiscredited obsession that justice and sympathy are incompatible with\r\ndiscipline and the firm handling of labour. Of course, justice and\r\nsympathy can have no place in a creed where labour is merely one of a\r\nnumber of troublesome items of the cost of production. Neither is shown,\r\nneither is expected. That type of employer has never recognized that\r\ncapital, brains and manual labour fill separate and distinct rôles in\r\nindustry. He looks upon himself as the all-dominant personality and\r\nLabour as his feudal and dependent hireling.\r\n\r\nNow domination, or any attempt at, or suspicion of it, is quite\r\nincompatible with co-operation; in fact, the least semblance of it in\r\nindustry will speedily kill any latent spirit of co-operation. Nor does\r\nit matter in the slightest on what ground the domination is based or\r\nasserted. It may be on intellectual superiority, technical experience,\r\norganizing capacity, social standing, I care not what; it is the poison\r\nof all industrial harmony. As soon as it appears there is straightway an\r\nend of all co-operation in any democratic organization, and sectarianism\r\nand strife mark the reaction that immediately ensues. Mutual agreement\r\nis the essential basis of co-operation, both from the objective and\r\nsubjective points of view. To secure agreement there must be the spirit\r\nto agree, and the existence of that spirit depends almost entirely on\r\nthe knowledge and belief that matters of industrial controversy will\r\nbe considered and adjusted on principles of justice and equity. My\r\nexperience of industry has left me convinced beyond all doubt on one\r\npoint—there is, deep down in the heart of the British workman, a sense of\r\njustice and fair-play. Often it takes time and trouble to vitalize it,\r\nto assist it in freeing itself from the tentacles of ignorance, Marxian\r\nsophistry and revolutionary formulae which entangle it, as weeds do a\r\nswimmer struggling to gain the surface, but in the end, if it gets a\r\nchance, it will assuredly triumph.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Need of Strict Justice\r\n\r\nThe unenlightened employer has not yet given it a chance. He does not\r\nbelieve in its existence, nor in its efficacy as a moderating influence.\r\nThere are no conceivable circumstances, he will tell you, which Labour\r\nwill not unjustly use for its own aggrandisement, if an opportunity\r\ncoincides with power. That in the past has, unfortunately, been the\r\ntradition on the part of reactionary employers no less than on the part\r\nof Labour. In regard to either justification or excuse, no distinction\r\nwhatsoever can be drawn between the two. Propositions and proposals\r\nfounded on equity and reason can, with confidence, be submitted to the\r\nworkman’s sense of justice. In many instances during the war, I have\r\nappealed to this sense of justice with signal success in shop matters\r\nof peculiarly acute trade controversy. Even in regard to victimization\r\ndisputes, always formidable questions, productive often of almost\r\nintractable controversy, that is to say, cases of dismissal, fine\r\nor reducing, on grounds alleged by the men of the prominence of the\r\n“victim” in furthering the interests of his Trade Union, or because of\r\nalleged breaches of unwritten shop law, invented, it would be said, by\r\nsome vindictive foreman. When masters and men have failed to adjust the\r\ndifference—the former taking their stand on “their right to maintain\r\ndiscipline,” the latter on their duty “to protect their Trade Union\r\ninterests”—I have invariably found it possible to settle the dispute by\r\ngetting down to principles of fair-play. If the workman who has been\r\n“dealt with” was a shop steward, and was really using his employer’s time\r\nfor doing his Trade Union branch work when he might and ought to have\r\nbeen doing his shop work, the men have accepted the position that, after\r\nnotice, the employer is entitled to take exception to that procedure.\r\nOn the other hand, if he has only been utilizing for Union business the\r\nmany periods of time which occur in the best organized shops when he is\r\n“waiting for work” or “standing by,” and has done it in such a way as not\r\nto interfere with his shop work, then the men claim that he has only done\r\nwhat he was entitled to do, and that an employer who objects to him doing\r\nUnion business under such circumstances is really out against the Union.\r\nMost fair-minded people would probably draw the same inference.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Money Value of Sympathy in Industry\r\n\r\nThere are to-day many employers, managers, under-managers, and foremen\r\nwho still act on the dogma that there is nothing to be got out of the\r\nsympathetic handling of labour. “It’s so much cutting air,” more than one\r\nhas said to me. If an employer of this type honestly believed there was\r\nmoney in it, he is far too keen a business man not to try it. But to many\r\nemployers Labour is still only a machine which, as long as it runs in any\r\nsort of way, is to be left severely alone; when it jerks or sticks it is\r\nto be lubricated with smooth words, professions of the employer’s anxiety\r\nfor its welfare, “soft sawder,” for which the men, naturally, have the\r\nutmost contempt.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sympathetic Handling of Labour a Special Art\r\n\r\nA very large number of employers have not realized yet that the\r\nsympathetic management of labour is a special art, calling for peculiar\r\nqualities of temperament and tact. Until that is accepted as sound\r\neconomics there can never be co-operation. Technical experience is\r\nthe usual qualification required of a foreman, seldom, if ever, is\r\nthe least regard paid to his ability to handle men sympathetically\r\nso as to get the best out of them. Yet that, much more than technical\r\ncapacity, contributes to workshop efficiency. There are many persons\r\nwholly unfitted by nature to have the charge of men, more especially to\r\nperform the responsible duty of taking on and discharging them. Their\r\npresence in a shop is a chronic source of irritation, and keeps the\r\nmen’s backs perpetually up. Co-operation, under such conditions, cannot\r\nexist. An outsider entering the shop can feel the strained relationship\r\nalmost intuitively. A sort of nervous tension seems to pervade the\r\nplace. No cheery words are exchanged between men and manager, as the\r\nlatter passes through the shop. A notice is often found in the office:\r\n“Workmen must wipe their feet before entering.” As a workman said to me:\r\n“No such direction is given to anyone who comes to place an order,” How\r\nmuch better to say to every one, “Please wipe your feet.” If a workman\r\nwants to see some one in authority he is kept hanging about, losing his\r\npiece-work earnings, or is brusquely told that the manager is engaged,\r\nwhile all the time he sees customers admitted with welcome to the office.\r\nOne manager frankly told me that but for his clerk, who artfully got rid\r\nof the workman always wanting to see him, he would never have had any\r\ntime to do his business. That indicates the attitude of mind that good\r\nemployers are fighting against. It is not considered by unprogressive\r\nemployers any part of the recognized duty of a manager to apply sympathy,\r\nunderstanding, and tact to the treatment of Labour. There is no doubt\r\nit requires very great time and patience and prolonged study and\r\ninvestigation of numerous circumstances which are on the surface trivial.\r\nA manager is often loath to devote to work of that kind time and energy\r\nwhich he thinks, and which many employers certainly think, can more\r\nprofitably be spent in technical and commercial activity.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Illustration of its Successful Application\r\n\r\nBut assuming that management will accept the teaching of the best\r\nemployers that the sympathetic handling of labour is an employer’s duty,\r\nand, apart from that, is good business, the problem then will be how to\r\nmake and sustain such an appeal to the worker that he will be induced\r\nto co-operate with the management. A similar problem confronted myself\r\nduring part of the war period when, as Director of Shipyard Labour, I\r\nhad charge of the labour in some 2,500 firms, employing something like\r\none million men. Output had to be secured and maintained at all costs,\r\nso when any trouble occurred my Department had to intervene if the\r\nmanagement and men failed to come to a speedy settlement. When forming\r\nthe Department I gathered together a small band of enthusiastic and\r\nfar-sighted employers and Trade Unionists, and in conjunction we made a\r\ndetermined and intensive effort to get right down _au fond_ and strike\r\nthe chords in industrial human nature, on whose vibration co-operation\r\nis dependent. Some simple principles were formulated, which, later, as\r\nexperience grew, were modified in detail. These were made the basis\r\nof the appeal, not merely in mass meetings, Trade Union lodges, and\r\nelsewhere among the men, but also, with the assistance—and it was loyally\r\ngiven—of the employers, carried into daily workshop practice. At the\r\ntime when these principles were first put into operation, there were\r\nclose on 200 strikes a week in the 2,500 firms. After a twelve-months’\r\nregime the strikes which had fallen regularly, month by month, came\r\ndown to under ten a week. Some employers denied that the principles had\r\nanything to do with the diminution of strikes. One of the most prominent\r\ndescribed them as “so much pap.” But the Trade Unions took a different\r\nview, and I hold many personal letters from some of the principal Unions\r\nattributing the whole of the improvement to the sympathetic regime that\r\nhad been put into operation—it was really nothing more than carrying\r\nsympathy and strict justice into all the details of workshop life. Far\r\nbe it from me to suggest that any State department, without executive\r\nresponsibility, can run labour as well as a private employer who has\r\nthat responsibility; the point is that enormous improvement in the\r\nco-operative spirit between employers and employed can be effected by the\r\nadoption of a well-developed _methodized_ system of handling labour based\r\non sympathetic principles.\r\n\r\nCo-operation is a vital essential for the reconstruction of industry.\r\nIt is the true antidote to revolution. It will only be forthcoming\r\nin industry when sound economic conviction operates in an atmosphere\r\nand environment of justice and sympathy. As long as economic fallacy\r\nis allowed to permeate the minds of employers and employed, leading\r\nthem to reject or belittle the material advantages of co-operation by\r\nrepresenting it as inimical to their respective interests, and as long\r\nas the want of sympathy and justice continues to feed that fallacy,\r\nco-operation will never emerge as an integrating force in industry. The\r\nremedy is, therefore, obvious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYED\r\n\r\n3. PRODUCTION IN INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n    The Importance of Production—What Production Depends on—The\r\n    Workers’ Notion of the Secret Fund—“Passing it on”—The\r\n    Workers’ Belief in Restricted Output—Introduction of Time- and\r\n    Labour-Saving Appliances—Payment by Results—Subdivision and\r\n    Simplification of Process—No “Niggling” at Prices.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Importance of Production\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to stress the national, the social, the industrial\r\nneed for production. That does not mean more output with no improvement\r\nin the ratio of efficiency. It means more output accompanied with\r\nincreased efficiency and therefore lower cost of production. It is\r\non cheapness of output that the demands of the home and the foreign\r\nconsumer for commodities largely depend. Restriction of output means\r\nfor the community high costs of commodities, less purchasing power, a\r\nlower standard of living; it means that there will not be available\r\neither the wealth to finance social reforms, or the capital required\r\nfor industry, and therefore worse conditions and less work for the\r\nworkers; it means reduced export trade and adverse exchanges. Apart\r\nfrom production, there is no fund from which labour can be paid, the\r\nonly fund is that consisting of the commodities and services and values\r\nwhich are produced. As the fund is made greater by the joint efforts of\r\nemployers and workmen, so can the wage paid to the worker be increased.\r\nOne worker is needed to realize the goods, values or services produced by\r\nanother worker. If both increase their output as much as is reasonably\r\npracticable, each has the maximum available for exchange, and both can\r\nsecure for themselves the greatest possible standard of living. On the\r\nother hand, if one particular worker limits his production, say, by\r\none-half of its reasonable maximum, he not only injures himself and\r\nhis dependents, because he throws away the opportunity of disposing\r\nof one-half of his labour, but he also injures the other workman\r\nwho, directly or indirectly, exchanges with him, and who would like\r\nto exchange the whole of the goods and values and services which he\r\nproduces, but who is prevented from disposing of more than one-half by\r\nreason of his opposite number’s selfish and stupid action. The present\r\nnational standard of living can by no human ingenuity be maintained under\r\nto-day’s conditions of output.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Production Depends on\r\n\r\nLord Weir has truly pointed out[21] that there are only four methods of\r\nimproving the volume and efficiency of our national production:\r\n\r\n(1) An increase in intensity of effort per operative hour;\r\n\r\n(2) An increase in the number of operative hours per individual per day;\r\n\r\n(3) An increase in the number of operative individuals;\r\n\r\n(4) A perfecting of methods, processes and organizations, by which waste\r\nof operative hours is eliminated.\r\n\r\nAccepting this as an accurate statement, which it is, of how alone output\r\ncan be increased, I wish to point out the immediate obstacles to an\r\nachievement of these four objects. They are these:\r\n\r\nIn regard to (1)—the workman’s low conception of work, his tendency, in\r\nmany trades, to lose time, his inveterate belief in restriction of output.\r\n\r\nIn regard to (2)—the conception of organized Labour that the present\r\n47- or 48-hour ordinary working week is a social reform with which no\r\ntampering will be permitted, and that if in times of trade prosperity\r\nmore hours are necessary, they ought to be worked as overtime.\r\n\r\nIn regard to (3)—the insistence of the Trade Unions, in this country,\r\non their rigid lines of demarcation of work—in other words, on certain\r\nwork being always reserved for certain Unions, without reference to the\r\nprevailing industrial or commercial conditions.\r\n\r\nIn regard to (4)—the opposition of the workers to the introduction of\r\ntime- and labour-saving appliances, or of payment by results—and Lord\r\nWeir adds: the killing of the spirit of enterprise among employers,\r\nas the result of the taxation policy of the Government; the lack of\r\nreciprocity and co-operation on the part of the Trade Unions, amounting\r\nto active obstruction; and bad statesmanship on the part of the\r\nemployers’ organizations.\r\n\r\nTo state these four methods in their order of relative practicability,\r\nthey run (1), (4), (3) and (2). All the obstacles enumerated above to\r\nsecuring greater production by methods (1), (4) and (3), are the fruit of\r\nunsound economic theories that have for many years past been sedulously\r\ninstilled into Labour, and are now accepted by it as part of its everyday\r\nrule of life and conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Workers’ Notion of the Secret Fund\r\n\r\nForemost, in normal times, comes the erroneous belief that all the\r\naspirations of Labour for increased remuneration, shorter hours,\r\nimproved conditions of employment, can be satisfied to the full out of\r\nthe existing profits of employers and current production. This has been\r\nargued incessantly before myself. It is honestly believed that all that\r\nis necessary to liquidate the demands of Labour is to devote to that\r\npurpose part only of the existing profits of industry, in their entirety\r\nsaid to be appropriated by avaricious employers. The sole impediment\r\nis considered to be the greed of employers, coupled with the fact that\r\nas industry is now organized they hold the money-bags. But this error\r\ncan be exposed if the demands of Labour are reduced to a definite\r\ncharge per annum on the industry in question, and each particular\r\nestablishment involved. It can usually be shown on the actual accounts in\r\ntypical establishments, at any rate in the engineering and shipbuilding\r\nindustries, that the demands of Labour could not be met out of existing\r\nprofits. In fact, in many cases, if the whole of employers’ profits were\r\nhanded over to Labour, and Capital left without any return whatsoever,\r\nthe demands of Labour could not be satisfied to anything like the full\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nThis delusion is one of the most pernicious in industry, because of its\r\nwidespread acceptance and its fatal results. It has been fostered by the\r\nwar conditions, as has already been explained. Employers made profits\r\nwhich exceeded in many cases those retainable under the Munitions of War\r\nor Finance Acts, and so it frequently did not matter to them what rate of\r\nwages they paid in order to expedite work. Moreover, war advances, far\r\nabove the rate of wages, were distributed under order of the Government\r\nCourts of Arbitration to cover the increased cost of living arising out\r\nof the abnormal conditions resulting from the war. These war advances\r\nwere generally paid by Government, in addition to the contract price for\r\nmunitions. Thus the workman saw very high nominal rates of wages paid,\r\nand the employers at the same time making much greater profits than they\r\ncould by law appropriate. Nothing was, therefore, more natural than\r\nto suppose that all demands could on the current basis of output be\r\nsatisfied out of existing profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Passing it on”\r\n\r\nAccepting, as will some sections of Labour, that their demands cannot\r\nbe met out of employers’ profits on present output, the alternative\r\nis, they say, that the manufacturer must raise his selling price by an\r\namount sufficient to cover the extra cost. In this it is assumed, of\r\ncourse, that the rate of production remains the same. It is a fixed\r\nidea that every manufacturer and the owners in every industry can raise\r\nprices without any difficulty whatsoever. In discussing this delusion,\r\nas I have frequently done, it becomes quite obvious that workmen do not\r\nappreciate the effect which an increase in the cost of production has\r\nin reducing the ambit of the market for the sale of the commodity in\r\nquestion, or in lessening the demand for it in a specific market, with\r\nconsequential curtailment of employment, and undermining of standard\r\nrates of wages. The regulation retort is that any trade not able to pay\r\nproper wages ought not to live. That, of course, depends on what is\r\n“proper,” When the wages are starvation wages, every one will agree the\r\nindustry ought not to live. When the wages, though sufficient to cover\r\n(1) subsistence, are not sufficient for (2) reasonable amenities of life,\r\nnor to allow adequately for (3) trade-skill, there may be difference\r\nof opinion, according to the circumstances of the particular industry,\r\nwhether it should be maintained or not. When, however, full and adequate\r\nremuneration is paid to cover (1), (2) and (3), it is suicidal policy for\r\nLabour to insist on such advances in wages as must kill the industry.\r\n\r\nIn advancing the contention that if the employer cannot, out of his\r\nexisting profits, pay the advance on wages claimed, it should be added to\r\nthe sales price, workmen invariably repudiate as wholly immaterial the\r\nresultant effect on trades other than their own, and especially on the\r\nconsuming community. If those claiming the advance are engaged in what is\r\ninelegantly called a “key industry,” that is to say, where their output\r\nis raw or semi-raw material for other industries, it is obvious that\r\nany rise in its cost may inflict serious damage on both employers and\r\nemployed in the dependent industries. But the workman’s retort is “let\r\nthem pass it on.” I have had that put to me on hundreds of occasions. The\r\neffect on the community is dismissed as quite irrelevant.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, the fashion of general advances in wages to cover\r\nincreased cost of living came into vogue. The consequent reaction on\r\nprices set up the “vicious circle” known to all economists where a\r\ngeneral advance in wages raises prices, thus forcing up the cost of\r\nliving, and so creating a fresh demand for a further increase in wages.\r\nOver and over again by simple illustrations I have tried to make this\r\n“vicious circle” clear to workmen. I have always been much impeded by\r\none circumstance. In the early days of the war, in certain districts, as\r\nsoon as a general advance in wages was awarded by the wages tribunals, or\r\nconceded by Government, the various lodging-house keepers put up their\r\nrents for rooms, or their charge for board. This was stigmatized by\r\nLabour as “profiteering.” Arguing by analogy, the workpeople contended\r\nthat when a general rise in prices followed a general advance in wages,\r\nit was entirely due to profiteering. It was never admitted by the\r\nworkmen that any part of the rise in prices was the natural, inevitable,\r\nlogical result of the general advances in wages, through the increase\r\nof purchasing power operating on the same supply of commodities. War\r\nexperiences have equally confused workmen’s minds with regard to the\r\neffect of high wages on the volume of employment. Whatever glimmering\r\nsuspicion the workmen had before the war that an advance in wages in\r\nmany industries tended directly, through increased cost of production,\r\nto bring about unemployment, has now practically been dissipated by the\r\nwar. Time after time, I have been told that none of the general advances\r\nin wages during the war has ever caused unemployment. The explanation,\r\nof course, is that during the war workmen were not to any great extent\r\nproducing commodities for an ordinary commercial market, but munitions of\r\nwar for the Government, and all they could turn out the Government could\r\ntake, so insatiable was its demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Workers’ Belief in Restricted Output\r\n\r\nWe come to another dangerous and widespread fallacy, the assumed\r\nadvantage of restricting output. This declares itself in many varied\r\nforms. One of the commonest is a definite limitation on the tonnage, or\r\nfeet lineal or square of the day’s work. When the day’s work is completed\r\nthe workman, if paid on time, will frequently remain at work, but doing\r\nnothing until the “hooter goes.” In other cases if paid on a piece-work\r\nbasis, the workman will sometimes leave the shop after his day’s work or\r\n“stint” is finished. I have investigated cases where workmen coming on\r\nat 7 a.m. finished their day’s work and went home by 10.30 or 11 a.m.\r\nOther methods of reaching the same end are less open. The operative,\r\ninstead of finishing his work early and then allowing his machine “to\r\ncut air” for the rest of the day, will with nice calculation slow down\r\nall day long so as to spin out the allotted day’s work more or less\r\nuniformly over the working day. Industrial experience during the war\r\nhas proved the existence, to an almost inconceivable extent, of this\r\nlatter method of limiting production. Perhaps I can best illustrate it\r\nfrom some cases within my personal knowledge. In one instance some boys\r\nstraight from a board school were put on to do a simple operation from\r\nwhich men had been withdrawn for more arduous duty. Working at the men’s\r\npiece-prices, they averaged £4. 15_s._ per normal working week against\r\nthe men’s £2 10_s._ That meant the boys turned out—nor were they any the\r\nworse for it physically—almost twice the men’s output. Women I put on\r\nto replace men at some simple machining operations made, after a short\r\nperiod of training, £6-£10 per week, against the men’s £4-£5. The women\r\nwere paid the men’s piece-prices for the operation. In another case men\r\nwho were working on piece-work, after learning of the announcement of\r\nthe Minister of Munitions that under no circumstances would piece-prices\r\nbe “cut,” speeded up their output by 120 per cent. These are only a few\r\nselected illustrations out of a large number.[22] They are concrete\r\nexemplifications of the appalling extent to which the false doctrine of\r\nlimiting output is rampant in industry—operative as an active orthodox\r\nTrade Union principle.\r\n\r\nBy limiting output the workman genuinely believes that he is performing\r\na moral duty to himself and to his trade. He argues first, that he is\r\nreducing unemployment by making the work go round; secondly, that he\r\nis keeping up the value of his handicraft by putting a premium on its\r\napplication. Workmen have described to me the difference between possible\r\nand actual production as being “their reserve fund.” Over and over\r\nagain this policy has been justified to me by reference to the action\r\nof commercial trade combinations which pool orders and limit the output\r\nof the works of certain of their members in order to ensure business\r\nfor other members less fortunately situated, and also by reference to\r\ngroups of manufacturers who systematically keep up prices by “keeping the\r\nbottom in the market” through restricting the quantity of their output\r\nthat is offered for sale. The workmen will tell you in words to which\r\nno economist can object that value is due to utility and to limitation\r\nof supply. What he overlooks is that all that is thereby established\r\nin practice is a minimum rate of wages, and that maximum earnings\r\ndepend on maximum output. There are many classical instances, well\r\nwithin memory, where unemployment in certain trades was in fact almost\r\nentirely abolished by restricting the output of those employed, notably\r\nby discontinuing the then existing systems of payment by results—“blood\r\nmoney” as it was called. These recollections live. But, as a matter\r\nof fact, these instances prove nothing. They occurred just about the\r\ncommencement of a depression in trade, and, in fact, the extra cost of\r\nproduction subsequently caused by the limitation of output, accelerated\r\nthe unemployment in those very trades. Still working men, like most men,\r\nargue from particular cases of personal experience to universals.\r\n\r\nThe only way to attack the heresy is from the concrete illustration\r\ndrawn from the United States of America. There restriction of output is\r\nnot merely unknown, it is definitely repudiated by the Trade Unions.\r\nUnfortunately, many labour intellectuals who have no knowledge of\r\nAmerican conditions pervert the facts and hold up to execration the\r\nindustrial organization in the United States of America. “Scientific\r\nmanagement,” they have told the British workman, “is merely cunningly\r\ndevised slavery in which the shackles of serfdom are so precisely\r\nadjusted that the workman is a mere cog, helplessly and inhumanly\r\nenmeshed in a grinding anti-social mechanism.” The average workman,\r\nhowever, pays little attention to rhetoric and rodomontade, from\r\nwhomsoever it may emanate, and I have succeeded in satisfying bodies of\r\nworkmen as to the value of production by taking an American establishment\r\nand giving the output, hours and remuneration per man per annum, or\r\nany other convenient period of time, along with the output, hours and\r\nremuneration per man for the same period in a comparable establishment\r\nin England. The output will be expressed in pounds sterling of wholesale\r\nmarket prices. This really does sink in. Then the moral can be driven\r\nhome. The vital truth can be shown that in a well-run establishment, as\r\noutput increases, the cost of the fixed charges per unit of production\r\ndecreases. Consequently every percentage increase in output—assuming no\r\n“softening” of the selling price—results in a larger percentage increase\r\nin the amount available for division between workmen and employer.\r\nIf that division is effected on equitable lines, there is an obvious\r\nadvantage to the worker. That is why the workman in the United States\r\nof America can take home much higher real earnings than his brother in\r\nthis country. It is not difficult to satisfy the hard-headed practical\r\nEnglish worker that these higher American earnings are neither manna\r\ndropped from heaven nor doles from more compassionate employers.\r\n\r\nIf there is scepticism as to the value to Trade Unions of production,\r\nthere is complete apathy as to the necessity of production for the\r\nnation’s sake. What is wanted is to secure conviction of the need by\r\nsimple homely illustrations. The extent to which in any community\r\nincreased production conduces to plenty, and plenty to employment, good\r\nwages, a higher standard of living, and low prices is beyond the present\r\nken of Labour. In other words, the proposition that the prosperity of a\r\ncountry depends upon the production in the country obtains no credence\r\nwhatsoever; it is generally treated by working men as a sheer irrelevance.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the account some reactionary employers, and\r\nunder-managers and foremen, cling to the hoary fallacy that however high\r\nthe output may be, workmen are never worth high earnings. Such persons\r\nseem to think that the payment of high wages, even when accompanied\r\nby high output, is a reflection on the management of the shop. They\r\nconstantly argue that high wages degenerate the workmen, and lead to\r\nlost time. In order to reduce earnings, when they are considered to be\r\ninordinately high, the piece-prices are “cut,” and time-allowances are\r\n“docked.” This is a peculiarly English folly. No American employer would\r\ndream of it. The results in England are disastrous. With the fear of\r\nhaving his trade-prices reduced, the workman will not “go all out,” but\r\nwill limit output and maintain his earnings at such a figure as he thinks\r\nwill not stimulate the employer to reduce prices or time-allowances. In\r\ncommencing a piece-job the operative will deliberately go slow so as to\r\nget a high price fixed, and thereby allow for any future cutting. The\r\nemployer ought to know that the more jobs that pass through or over a\r\nworkman’s machine or bench in the shift or working day the greater is the\r\nnumber of jobs over which standing and fixed charges and the invariable\r\nportion of the working costs are apportioned, and, therefore, the smaller\r\nis the debit on each operation and the lower is the cost of production.\r\nIf the employer can get high production, it is to his direct interest to\r\nallow high earnings for it. This is well accepted by American employers,\r\nand represents normal shop practice in the United States of America.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction of Time- and Labour-Saving Appliances\r\n\r\nAnyone acquainted with industry in the United States of America and in\r\nEngland cannot fail to notice one further striking contrast. In the\r\nUnited States of America time- and labour-saving appliances, machines and\r\nmethods are being continually put into service by employers, and loyally\r\noperated by labour. It is recognized as being in the joint interests\r\nof them both. It clearly is. Anything that results in a net reduction\r\nof output-cost, after allowing for extra interest and depreciation,\r\nbenefits not merely employers, but also employed. In England, however,\r\nworkpeople seriously regard time- and labour-saving devices as inimical\r\nto their interests, and subversive of trade-rights. It is contended that\r\nthe introduction of such devices leads to the displacement of labour\r\nand to unemployment. In this connection labour has learned nothing from\r\nexperience. Improved machinery has enormously bettered the worker’s lot.\r\nIn the United States of America the resultant reduction in output-cost\r\nis admittedly the reason for the much higher real wages of American\r\nworkmen as compared with their English and Scottish confrères. Nor\r\nhas it led to unemployment in the United States of America. There is\r\nno reason why it should do so even temporarily. The introduction of\r\ntime- and labour-saving appliances is always a gradual process in any\r\nfactory. Ordinary foresight and organization by an employer ought to\r\nenable any men displaced still to be retained in employment. But many\r\nEnglish employers have impeded the introduction of labour-saving devices\r\nby haggling over the readjustment of piece-rates in respect of the\r\ninstallation of machines giving improved output. The American employer,\r\non the other hand, tries, after allowing for the costs of the new\r\nmachine, to maintain, as far as possible, the old piece-rates, with the\r\nresult that the workmen’s daily earnings are increased by its use. The\r\nEnglish employer is inclined to think that he is justified in reducing\r\npiece-rates so long as the workmen’s daily earnings are maintained. It\r\nis unnecessary to point out which policy is most likely to attract the\r\nwage-earner to the use of improved machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\nPayment by Results\r\n\r\nNothing in industry is surrounded by so much confusion and ignorance,\r\nboth among employers and employed, as the question of payment by\r\nresults. The value of this method of payment in promoting production is\r\nindisputable. I have many actual cases in mind where the introduction of\r\npiece-work in place of time-work resulted in an increase of output up\r\nto 110 per cent., thereby materially reducing the cost of production.\r\nYet while in some trades, for example the cotton trade, the operatives\r\nrefuse to work on any basis other than piece-work, in other trades,\r\nfor example carpentering and many sections of engineering, piece-work\r\nis considered a “pestilential system” [_sic_] tending to unemployment,\r\ndegradation of the worker, and untold evils. It is in regard to payment\r\nby results on the premium bonus system that the greatest misconception\r\nprevails amongst both masters and men. That is a system under which a\r\ntime is fixed for each job. If the job is done in less than the fixed\r\ntime, the time saved is divided in a definite proportion between employer\r\nand worker—generally half and half in England—and the latter paid for\r\nhis portion at his ordinary time-rate. The system has provoked in this\r\ncountry, unlike the United States of America, the greatest animosity on\r\nthe part of the Trade Unions. Their point is that on a piece-work basis,\r\nwhere the man is paid a definite price for each article or operation,\r\nthe more he does the more he is paid. For all time he saves in finishing\r\nan article, he receives the full benefit, the employer’s benefit being\r\nthe lower cost of production resulting from increased output. What right\r\nthen, it is argued, has the employer, like a parasite, to make anything\r\nout of the time which the worker saves on the premium-bonus system. The\r\nargument is plausible, but misleading. It entirely overlooks the fact\r\nthat under a piece-work system, where the workman is paid for all the\r\ntime saved, prices are necessarily fixed on a much less liberal basis\r\nthan time allowances on a premium-bonus basis. In the latter case, just\r\nbecause the employer gets a share of the time saved, he can adjust the\r\nrate generously, or as rate-fixers put it, “fix the price loosely.”\r\nIf production is to be furthered in this country, the whole system of\r\npayment proportioned to output must be lopped free of its perversion by\r\ncertain employers, and emancipated from the prejudice of Trade Unions.\r\nWhen displayed intelligibly in its true economic characteristics, the\r\nsystem will speak for itself. The actual rates to be fixed under any\r\nparticular system are, of course, a fair matter for collective bargaining.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubdivision and Simplification of Process\r\n\r\nAn idea is commonly encountered among the rank and file that to keep\r\nup the labour costs of every operation or job is the best way to\r\nmaintain the general value of the labour of the operatives concerned. An\r\nillustration may be taken from the engineering industry. In engineering,\r\nas is well known, England was the pioneer. The practice in the early\r\ndays was for a skilled turner or millwright, or other craftsman, to\r\nundertake a job, perform all the necessary machine and bench operations,\r\nand carry it through to completion. Later, as work increased in volume,\r\nand still later in diversity, there gradually evolved a differentiation\r\nbetween the turner and the fitter, and in more recent times, between\r\nturners and fitters and other kinds of engineering craftsmen. But the\r\nessence of the business was that every person concerned in the work\r\nshould be a tradesman, or skilled man. In recent times, the employers\r\nsucceeded in establishing “their right”—which is now being questioned—to\r\npromote unskilled men, perhaps shop labourers, to work certain classes\r\nof machines, capstan and turret lathes, etc. These men were graded as\r\nmachinists, and when the trade became organized generally received\r\nabout three-fourths of the skilled turner’s rate. They were designated\r\n“semi-skilled” men. The point to be observed is that any operation\r\namong the many thousands that constitute skilled work is deemed to be a\r\n“skilled operation,” performable only by a skilled man, and if in special\r\ncircumstances it is undertaken by any other person, supposing such an\r\nimprobable case, it carries the full skilled rate of pay. Very similar,\r\nbut somewhat less rigid, conventions exist in regard to semi-skilled\r\nwork. The inflexible way in which the engineering Unions enforce these\r\ntrade practices has certainly reserved exclusively for skilled men a\r\nlarge sphere of work, but it keeps up production costs, and retards\r\ndevelopment of the industry. Whenever a new and improved machine has been\r\nintroduced, a machine, say, of a type where the skill was mainly in the\r\nmachine, and no longer to anything like the same degree required of the\r\nworker, there has been a constant struggle between the Unions and the\r\nemployers as to whether the machine should or should not be operated by\r\na skilled man. Sometimes the employers have won, sometimes the Unions—it\r\nis a pure question of relative strength. But the obvious waste of skill\r\nin employing one skilled man on one of these machines when he could\r\nmanage two or more, and the payment of the skilled rate, all added to the\r\nprevailing limitation of production, have discouraged English employers\r\nfrom installing up-to-date appliances and so cheapening production.\r\n\r\nThis is not all the story. In the United States of America the invariable\r\npractice is to subdivide every job into its simple constituent\r\noperations, allocate each simple machine operation to a machine expressly\r\ndesigned, or “set up” or “rigged” for that special operation, and\r\ncapable of being tended by an unskilled person after a small modicum of\r\ntraining. So also in regard to non-machine operations, that is to say,\r\nassembling or fitting. Each operation is allocated to a special person,\r\nin the first instance probably quite unskilled, who becomes proficient\r\nand efficient at this one line of work. There is little or no haggling\r\nabout the remuneration of these unskilled operatives. The volume of\r\nproduction and the consequent ability to pay high wages obviate that. It\r\nis never contended by the Machinists’ Union that all of these subdivided\r\noperations must be done by skilled men, and by them only. Yet in England\r\nit is practically a rule that no man in a Union engineering workshop may\r\nlift a file and do the smallest amount of “rough” filing unless he is a\r\nskilled fitter.\r\n\r\nIt is a platitude to insist that the natural and efficient evolution of\r\nindustry involves subdivision. It is, in fact, the governing condition of\r\nefficiency and low production cost. It is equally evident, from American\r\nexperience, that there is nothing in subdivision really hurtful to the\r\nskilled men, their trade, or their standard of remuneration. Subdivision\r\nin the United States of America has led to an enormous output. All\r\nthe vast number of machines in service must be set up, repaired, and\r\nperiodically overhauled. Only the skilled men can do that. The machine\r\n“tenders” or “minders” must be supervised. That, again, is work for\r\nskilled men. All the tools for the machines must be ground, repaired,\r\nand in most cases “set up”—more work for which skilled men alone are\r\nsuitable. In short, in the United States of America, the skilled men\r\nenjoy better conditions, a higher status, and receive greater real wages\r\nthan the skilled men in this country. The latter must be helped to\r\nrealize, and quickly, that their present policy of preserving for skilled\r\nmen exclusively each simple constituent operation now included in skilled\r\nmen’s work is detrimental to their interests, is stifling industry, and\r\nstrangling the trade of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo “Niggling” at Prices\r\n\r\nAt the same time, a stern caution must be administered to certain\r\nemployers. With labour charges forming so large a proportion of the costs\r\nof production, some employers are constantly on the alert to pull down\r\nwages by fair means or foul. A slight alteration is made in the method\r\nof manufacture, or some device that would not deceive a first year’s\r\napprentice is fitted to a machine, and it is then claimed that the work\r\nhas become such as entitles the employer to put unskilled or semi-skilled\r\nmen on to it, or alternatively, to reduce the skilled man’s price. Sharp\r\npractice of that sort sours the shop. It intensifies enormously the\r\ndifficulty, at present great enough, of the good employer, struggling\r\nto reorganize his business fairly and properly on efficient and honest\r\nsubdivision lines. Present trade customs, as long as they effectively\r\nexist, must be honoured. No employer should be entitled to vary the\r\naccepted trade grading of the work or its accompanying rate of wages\r\nor prices unless there is a genuine and substantial change in process\r\nor machinery which in reality supplants the skill of the worker and\r\nmanifestly increases production.\r\n\r\nSo far as improvement of production is concerned, the difficulty first,\r\nlast, and all the time is the bitter enslavement of the mind of the\r\nworker, and, if I may borrow the phrase, the “collective mind” of\r\nthe Trade Unions, by economic fallacy, and this must be attacked and\r\nvanquished before any real progress can be made. The remedy is education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDUSTRY AND THE COMMUNITY\r\n\r\n    The Formation of Sound Public Opinion—The Responsibility of the\r\n    Consumer—The Duty of the Citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf too little consideration for the community has been exercised by\r\nindustry—and that is unquestionably proved in the foregoing chapters—the\r\ncommunity has scarcely realized its duties to the workers in industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Formation of Sound Public Opinion\r\n\r\nIndustrial disputes in the long run must be decided by the force of\r\npublic opinion. In the past there has been far too great an inclination\r\non the part of the public to dissociate themselves from industrial\r\ncontroversy as though it concerned them not. Apart from the direct\r\neconomic effect of any great strike upon the consuming public, the\r\ncommunity is under a definite moral obligation to try and reach a\r\nright conclusion on the issue and to use the weight of its opinion to\r\nsecure a fair and equitable settlement. In the course of any strike of\r\nimportance immediate tribute is paid by both sides to the power of the\r\npublic. This is evidenced by the various statements of their respective\r\ncases which emanate from each side. Labour is specially sensitive to the\r\ncontrol of public opinion, and is the first to realize the hopelessness\r\nof protracting any strike against which public opinion is hardening.\r\nTherefore, both in regard to ascertainment of facts and an intelligent\r\ndetermination of the merits of each industrial controversy, the public is\r\nlaid under great obligations. It is one of labour’s chief complaints that\r\nthe average shareholder makes no effort whatever at general meetings of\r\nhis company to ascertain the facts in regard to strikes or lock-outs, or\r\nto regulate his investments with some regard to his company’s treatment\r\nof its workers. This complaint is justified.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Responsibility of the Consumer\r\n\r\nEvery consumer has definite responsibilities. In the middle of last\r\ncentury he was almost omnipotent, and industry’s chief object was to\r\nmeet, indeed to anticipate, his desires. His power to-day is not\r\nso unrestricted by reason of the competition between consumers in\r\ndifferent nations for limited world supplies, and because of the better\r\norganization of employers and employed. But still the consumer has\r\nimmense power, and in the interests of industry, society, and, indeed,\r\nof the nation, he ought to realize his duties. The day has long gone\r\npast when it was thought that all expenditure by a consumer, whether in\r\nnecessaries or luxuries, conduced alike to the benefit of trade and the\r\nincrease of the national wealth. It is now recognized that at all times\r\nthe supply of labour and raw material and capital—“the wealth heap,”\r\nas Mr. Hartley Withers graphically describes it in his _Poverty and\r\nWaste_—is limited. If, therefore, any consumer demands that more luxuries\r\nbe produced than necessaries, there must be fewer necessaries for those\r\nwho want them, and those at higher prices because we are expending on\r\nluxuries capital and labour and raw materials otherwise available for the\r\nproduction of necessaries. Even if at any time the supply of necessaries\r\nexceeds the demand, that does not justify the production of luxuries.\r\nIf luxuries are demanded, capital and labour and raw materials must be\r\nmore or less permanently hypothecated for their production. If, on the\r\nother hand, luxuries are dispensed with, then capital and labour will\r\nbe diverted to the production of necessaries, with consequent reduction\r\nof prices and improvement in real wages of workers as the supply of\r\nnecessaries increases. As capital more or less automatically tends to\r\nflow to whatever class of production affords the greatest remuneration,\r\nit is really only the consumer who can control in what particular class\r\nof production it is invested. A question will always remain: What is\r\nunreasonable luxury? That is, of course, a question which each person\r\nmust answer for himself, but anything, as I view the matter, is a\r\nreprehensible luxury when its production results in the consumption of\r\nwealth or attraction of labour which is needed for more urgent national\r\npurposes. If any consumer is in doubt, he can save instead of spend. He\r\ncan invest his savings in industry, or, if not, leave them on deposit\r\nwith his bank, which can do it for him. By this means new permanent\r\nindustries will be started, production of necessaries increased, wages\r\nand purchasing power improved, and a definite service rendered to the\r\ncommunity by the establishment of undertakings which, if sound and\r\nproperly managed, will supply employment, and increase and circulate\r\nwealth in a way the production of a luxury could not attempt to rival.\r\nThe consumer has a duty nowadays to think.\r\n\r\nThere is a much smaller supply of wealth than most persons realize,\r\nwhich accentuates the duty of every person to use his income in the\r\nmanner most beneficial to the community. In his book _The Division of the\r\nProduct of Industry_, Professor Bowley shows (p. 47) that if we take the\r\ntax-paying income for 1911 of residents in the United Kingdom derived\r\nfrom home sources, viz. £742,000,000, and from it subtract (i) earned\r\nincomes—giving no earner more than £160 per annum—(ii) farmers’ incomes,\r\nand (iii) endowed charities, the balance left is only £550,000,000.\r\nSubtracting from this latter figure the pre-war amounts required for\r\nnational saving and national expenses there remained only 200 to 250\r\nmillions “which on the extremist reckoning can have been spent out of\r\nhome-produced income by the rich or moderately well-off on anything\r\nin the nature of luxury.” This sum would have been little more than\r\nsufficient to bring the average wages of adult men and women up to a\r\nminimum of 35_s._ 3_d._ weekly for a man and 20_s._ for a woman, which\r\nMr. Rowntree in _The Human Needs of Labour_ estimates as reasonable—with\r\nprices as at July, 1914. Professor Bowley puts it in yet another way.\r\nBefore the war, there were about 10,000,000 households each containing\r\non an average about 4½ persons, of which nearly 2 in each household\r\nwere wage-earners. If the total home income had been divided equally\r\nround, the average net income per family, after all rates and taxes were\r\npaid and an adequate sum invested in home industries, would have been\r\nnominally £153 from home income, which, if the balance of income brought\r\nhome from abroad and not re-invested abroad were also divided equally\r\nround, would be increased to £162 per annum. The equal distribution of\r\nincome would, of course, have enormously increased prices. Professor\r\nBowley observes: “When it is realized that the whole income of the nation\r\nwas only sufficient for reasonable needs if equally divided, luxurious\r\nexpenditure is seen to be more unjustifiable even than has been commonly\r\nsupposed.”\r\n\r\nThe Brussels International Financial Conference said: “Above all, to fill\r\nup the gap between the supply of, and the demand for, commodities, it is\r\nthe duty of every patriotic citizen to practise the strictest possible\r\neconomy, and so to contribute his maximum effort to the common weal. Such\r\nprivate action is the indispensable basis for the fixed measures required\r\nto restore public finances.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duty of the Citizen\r\n\r\nThe principles of Labour policy which I have outlined are generally in\r\nthe direction of freedom and in its best sense individualism, looking\r\nrather to the development in industry of co-operation than to struggle\r\nand the use of power to settle differences and express the balance\r\nof economic forces. But industrial freedom and individualism impose\r\ncorrelative responsibilities on all citizens, especially in regard to the\r\nmaintenance of efficient social services. At first sight, any mention of\r\nsocial services may appear a contradiction of the argument developed so\r\nfar. Social services to many minds are inevitably associated with relief\r\nin the narrow sense of the word, conceived as a concession to the clamour\r\nof Socialist theorists. In reality they are the growing expression of an\r\nincreased social sensitiveness. No State can be healthy which is based on\r\na foundation of hardship and suffering. Certain abuses must be removed,\r\nand certain conditions remedied. In any advanced economic society the\r\nState must take action, has taken action, and will in future extend its\r\naction. The social conscience, to anyone who reads history, is a real\r\nand growing force. But to be sound and effective it must of necessity be\r\nbased upon voluntary individual co-operation.\r\n\r\nAs things are to-day, we must recognize that State activity in social\r\nservices is in many branches ahead of the understanding of the ordinary\r\nman. It has, through the nature of our political machinery, developed\r\nin a specialized manner, which throws a heavy burden upon legislators\r\nand administrators whether voluntary or official. There is a consequent\r\nconfusion, lack of co-ordination, and overlapping of effort which leads\r\nto waste, not merely of money, but of what is, in the long run, more\r\nimportant—human enthusiasm, effort and efficiency. In dealing with this\r\nproblem, the individual is of vital importance. The average citizen must\r\nknow more, take more interest, and render more service, if order and\r\neconomy are to take the place of confusion and waste. The necessity for\r\nthis individual interest is reinforced by the present financial situation.\r\n\r\nWe are, as a nation, recovering, in fact, becoming slowly convalescent,\r\nfrom the effects of war-time and post-war inflation of money and credit.\r\nWe have realized that sound finance and the balancing of the Budget\r\nare the necessary foundations of prosperity. Other European nations\r\nare still enjoying the temporary delusive prosperity that can always\r\nbe obtained by inflation and dishonest finance. To carry the economic\r\nargument one stage further, we must realize that the State can only carry\r\nnon-producers to the extent to which industry can obtain a surplus, after\r\nproviding for wages, interest, replacements, etc. The State cannot, by\r\nany arrangement of taxation, loans or administrative activity, provide\r\nan artificial standard of life, which is not earned by human individual\r\nactivity. There is, therefore, urgent need for education in finance, in\r\nboth its public and private aspects. Some of us are learning the lesson\r\nby the bitter experience of high rates and taxes, others by the hardships\r\nof unemployment. But out of this experience much good is coming. We\r\nare learning the true and permanent bases of national prosperity. The\r\ndangers of Great Britain to-day are not to be found in Red Revolution.\r\nDemocracy will fail, if it fails at all, from a lack of understanding of\r\neconomics and finance. Politicians without scruple or foresight may hold\r\nout bribes of immediate material advantages, trusting to some juggling\r\nof figures to enable them to redeem their promises. During the war, the\r\nNational Savings Committee, by a steady education in economics—converting\r\nfinancial theories of currency, goods and services into the terms of men\r\nand munitions—educated the general public into the social consequences\r\nof spending and thrift. The control of national finances so established\r\nunder the patriotic stimulus and urgency of war is no less necessary in\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThe history of social legislation in the twentieth century is the\r\nexpression not merely of democratic pressure, but of the increased\r\nsocial sensitiveness to the national conscience, awakened by individuals\r\nof outstanding merit protesting that certain evils should no longer\r\nexist. As the industrial revolution worked itself out, it was possible\r\nto ascertain, by patient investigation, its weaknesses and evils, and\r\nto provide certain remedies. Based on a steadily growing prosperity,\r\nits record is worth reciting; a wide extension of education providing\r\nin increasing degree an opportunity to the able men and women in all\r\nranks of society to develop their individuality; a general standard of\r\neducation which proved its value in increasing temperance, diminished\r\ncrime, and growing sense of public spirit, culminating in attention to\r\nthe physical condition of school-children, that in normal times would\r\nhave given every child a happy healthy childhood. In public health,\r\nthe elimination of the most dangerous infectious diseases, a steady\r\nimprovement of sanitary conditions, and an education in preventive\r\nmedicine, that can be proved by statistics to have been directly\r\nremunerative. On the positive side, an extension of infant welfare work,\r\nwhich, relying on the natural affection of mothers, and calling upon them\r\nto develop their own individuality, has for a small expenditure reduced\r\nthe infant death rate by half. Health Insurance on a contributory basis\r\nhas lessened the sham of sickness in the wage-earner’s family, and as\r\nthe results of the quinquennial valuations of Approved Societies are\r\nmore widely known and understood, will overcome any remaining adverse\r\ncriticism. Old age pensions have removed the fear of an old age spent in\r\ndependence on grudging relatives, or on the Poor Law, with its deterrent\r\nassociations. The treatment of unemployment has gained in efficiency and\r\nthoroughness by the steady gaining of experience—the Labour Bureaux,\r\nUnemployment Insurance, the use of State credits to finance international\r\ntrade and guarantee extensions of industry at home are laying foundations\r\nof a new order—the irregular activities of voluntary organizations and\r\nlocal authorities in emigration have developed into an Imperial Scheme\r\nfor Overseas Settlement. Under the existing conditions of financial\r\nstringency, we have to consider how this burden can, in the future, be\r\nborne. How much of the national income can, in the years immediately to\r\ncome, be devoted to services admittedly admirable in their objects? One\r\nfact becomes clear: at all costs we must hold on to the main essentials\r\nin the public services and keep the machinery in working order so that it\r\nwill be ready for expansion when financial conditions make it possible.\r\nThe fall in prices, resulting in a reduced cost of living, lower war\r\nbonuses, lower cost of materials, is bringing, and will bring, even\r\nfurther relief to the taxpayer and ratepayer. The adjustment, however,\r\nlags behind the change in individual circumstances, and is the cause of\r\nmuch criticism of those in authority. If, however, this policy of holding\r\non to essentials is to be carried out, there will have to be an increased\r\nmeasure of economy—economy, not merely of money, but, in its original\r\nAristotelian sense, of management of a household. This can only be done\r\nby attention to details, by a higher standard of public spirit, by which\r\nthe services in health, education, etc., are looked upon by those who\r\nbenefit as something for which they pay, and for which, in the long\r\nrun, they are responsible. If the desire for education were widespread,\r\nthere would be an immediate economy in school attendance officers, rota\r\ncommittees, and all the machinery devised to block the holes in the\r\neducational net. If the individual standard of care for health were\r\nraised as it can be raised by such movements as health weeks, baby weeks,\r\netc., there would be a consequent reduction in the expenditure on Public\r\nHealth. But the largest measure of economy of the household management\r\ntype would come through a co-ordination of the activities of national\r\ndepartments, local authorities and voluntary organizations. Attention\r\nhas recently been called to the advance of expenditure due to the system\r\nof grants-in-aid to local authorities, by which local authorities are\r\nled to spend money on the false assumption that the ratepayer will\r\ngain something to be paid for by the taxpayer. The discrepancy between\r\nthe rating system and the tax-paying system is the root cause of many\r\ndifficulties, but a wider understanding of finance would obviate the\r\ngrosser evils.\r\n\r\nUnder our English system of government, all recent legislation has\r\nbeen of specialized character dealing with specified classes, or a\r\nparticular evil. As each need was recognized, a special administration\r\nwas set up to deal with it, and we now have innumerable inquiry\r\nofficers, inspectors, officials of various grades administering Acts\r\nof Parliament and regulations in varying ways. The whole relationship\r\nof national departments and local authorities requires revision and\r\nreorganization. Owing to the burden of rates on the ratepayer driving the\r\nlocal authorities to rely more and more upon subsidies from the National\r\nExchequer, and to their refusing to undertake new burdens, social\r\nservices have been identified with departmental activity, red tape and\r\nbureaucracy. Local government has suffered from a gradual atrophy.\r\n\r\nNow, under pressure of financial stringency, is the time to overhaul\r\nour social machinery. It needs the services of the best brains that the\r\ncountry can produce. The problem has two aspects. First comes financial\r\npolicy. Owing to the complexity of administration, no local check can\r\nexist on the total expenditure in any area. Inquiry is urgently needed,\r\non the lines of the national return known as the Drage return, setting\r\nout for each local government area the sums paid by the local authority,\r\nHealth and Education, etc., the Poor Law, and the National Ministries of\r\nPensions, Labour, etc. At present the facts are not known, and, indeed,\r\nare not available. Secondly, in administration, we need a co-ordination\r\nof investigation and inquiry, and some measure of co-ordination in the\r\npayment of relief; at the very least, a register of assistance by which\r\noverlapping in payments and machinery could be avoided. The extent to\r\nwhich either of these movements could be successful depends almost\r\nentirely upon local interest. Any scheme set up by Government would\r\nbut add to the general confusion. Economy in this sense is a strict\r\ninquiry and attention to detail, and is a service which can only be\r\nrendered by those of business experience and ability. Finally would\r\ncome a reorganization of the Poor Law, not in any spirit of hostility\r\nto those who have done such admirable work in spite of abuse and\r\nmisrepresentation, but a reorganization on to new areas coinciding with\r\nthe other areas of local government, and more nearly adjusted to the\r\npresent industrial conditions.\r\n\r\nAs a social policy, the insistence on economy will seem dull, but the\r\ncomment of the old lady about husbands that the good ones are dull\r\napplies equally to social policy. The future development of social\r\nservices must depend upon the economic and financial future. No one under\r\npresent conditions can advocate fresh channels of expenditure, or the\r\nwidening of existing channels. This is not a confession of failure, or an\r\nadmission of social stagnation. We can no longer measure social reform by\r\nthe gradually increasing sums of money spent in particular specialized\r\nservices. We must, for a future as long as we can foresee, measure\r\nsocial progress in the terms of the social service that the individual\r\nis prepared to render. As a preparation we need two elements: (1) wider\r\neconomic education; (2) wider knowledge of social conditions, and the\r\nprovision for dealing with social evils. For the first the development\r\nof the Savings Movement is a guide. Started in 1916, with the twofold\r\nfunction of economic education and the provision of facilities for the\r\nsmall investor, it has grown into a financial instrument of unlimited\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\nIn the six months ending March 31, 1922, £93,000,000 have been\r\ninvested in Savings Certificates, a sum which is more remarkable when\r\none considers the conditions in industry during this time. By a wise\r\nforesight, arrangements have been made by which local authorities can\r\nborrow from the Public Works Loans Commissioners 50 per cent. of the\r\nmoney raised in the area of any local authority. In brief, this means\r\nthat £46,500,000 per annum of new capital is being saved, and made\r\navailable for works of public improvement if required, while another\r\n£46,500,000 will be available for the repayment of ways and means\r\nadvances which will thus set free bank credits for the financing of\r\nprivate trade. It is a steady regular funding of the floating debt by\r\nmoney which is actually saved. As a measure of comparative magnitude of\r\nmillions it is well to point out that the total cost of Old Age Pensions\r\nfor the past financial year was £21,750,000, and the total cost of Poor\r\nLaw in the year ending March 31, 1920, was £28,500,000. This measure of\r\nsuccess has concealed to some extent the other function of the Committee,\r\nviz. economic education. In the last analysis the problem of unemployment\r\nbecomes one of finance. So far as it can be alleviated by measures of\r\ninsurance or relief or emigration, taxation and rates will provide\r\nthe means, but beyond all compulsion, the individual has a measure of\r\nresponsibility. Wise spending, the avoidance of waste and extravagance,\r\nwill do more to restore the foundations of industry and credit than\r\nany action by Government. Just as during the war it was possible to\r\ndivert goods and services from private ends to the main national need of\r\nproviding men and munitions necessary for victory, so to-day a conscious\r\ncontrol of individual expenditure, including a measure of personal thrift\r\nand saving, will mean lower rates of interest, a larger amount of credit,\r\nand a general improvement of trade and employment.\r\n\r\nAs regards the second element, viz. the wider knowledge of social\r\nconditions, foundations are being laid by voluntary effort. In all the\r\nbig industrial areas a growing measure of interest is being taken in\r\nsocial conditions. The pre-war voluntary associations are realizing\r\ntheir inevitable connection with the Government Departments and local\r\nauthorities. Councils, representative of local authorities and voluntary\r\nassociations, have been formed, based, not on the Victorian ideal of the\r\nLady Bountiful, but on the juster, saner ideal of a common citizenship\r\nowing service to the community. Practical steps are being taken to reduce\r\nthe chaos and overlapping in effort and money: in one place a survey\r\nof local conditions; in another a handbook of information on the local\r\nprovision; in yet another a system of mutual registration of assistance\r\nand relief, and finally, an investigation into the total sums spent out\r\nof public funds in social services. Underlying it all is the personal\r\nservice rendered by social workers, as welfare workers, Guilds of Help,\r\nprohibition officers, infant welfare workers, etc. Out of experience\r\nhas come the understanding that two types of co-operation are needed:\r\nfirst, the co-operation of experts in co-ordinating questions of policy;\r\nsecondly, the co-operation of individual citizens in solving the problems\r\nof the individual in trouble. From a wide experience of industrial\r\nunrest there is a firm conviction that the hard cases, the unintentional\r\ninjustices, the administrative difficulties, summed up by the phrase “red\r\ntape,” are a more fruitful source of trouble than the larger grievances.\r\n\r\nThis advocacy of personal service in many fields and in differing degrees\r\nis not the vapouring of a social visionary, but is an expression of the\r\ngenius of our race. Every reform, every method of social advance, has\r\nowed its existence to the enthusiasm of volunteers trying a new idea,\r\nfinding it work successfully, and then convincing others that it should\r\napply throughout the country. It is not muddling through, but the onward\r\nmarch of individual freedom, which includes a freedom to combine and a\r\nfreedom to persuade and convince others that a new way is the right way.\r\nThe Teutonic method of social improvement by compulsion, not for its\r\nown sake, but for military purposes, influenced English thought for a\r\ngeneration. The result is seen in a development of the State far beyond\r\nthe capacity or desires of our people. The remedy is to be found, not\r\nin a further treatment of homœopathic doses of the same medicine, but\r\nby relying upon the natural, healthy development of the national spirit\r\nthrough and in the individual.\r\n\r\nThe uncovenanted service that is needed from each member of the community\r\n“is inspired service that is not measured in cash, about which there are\r\nno overtime disputes, and in which time and a half or double time is\r\nwelcomed rather than objected to. And is not that the kind of service for\r\nwhich the world is pining? Unless we can do away with the nicely balanced\r\ngive and take we shall not make progress in alleviating the sufferings of\r\nhumanity.” And there is an even broader vision. As against the extreme\r\nSocialists who preach class-warfare, and try to sever class from class,\r\nthere is only one true antidote—some strong, compelling, active principle\r\nthat tends to bring together all classes, not for selfish ends, but\r\nspringing from an ever-present sense of the brotherhood of men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This is only the number directly affiliated; there are in all 2,350\r\ndivisional and Local Labour Parties and Trades Councils.\r\n\r\n[2] Reprinted, with additions, as _The Revolutionary Movement in Great\r\nBritain_.
