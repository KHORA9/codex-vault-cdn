HUBBARD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEDICATION\r\n\r\n_To the Hon. Henry G. Hubbard, of Middletown, Conn._\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: Your name, associated with many pleasant memories in the past,\r\nand in later years with substantial tokens of esteem, is held in grateful\r\nrecollection; and the hope that these pages may serve to interest an\r\noccasional leisure hour, has led to their being inscribed to you, by your\r\nfriend and relative.\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Life and Times of Red Jacket\" by Colonel William L. Stone, has been\r\nbefore the public for many years. The industry and ability of the author\r\nhave made it a work of great value, and his extensive researches have left\r\nbut little room for anything new to be said, by one coming after him. Yet\r\nthe fact need not be concealed that many, who were intimately acquainted\r\nwith Red Jacket, were disappointed when they came to read his biography.\r\nIf it had been prepared under the direct influence and superintendence of\r\nThayendanegea, or Brant, it could not have reflected more truly the animus\r\nof that distinguished character. Red Jacket in his day was the subject, at\r\ndifferent times of much angry feeling, and jealousy. The author has not\r\ntaken pains to embalm it, in these memorials of the great orator of the\r\nSenecas. Much that was the subject of criticism during his life, admits of\r\na more charitable construction, and the grave should become the receptacle\r\nof all human resentments.\r\n\r\nThe author acknowledges his indebtedness to the labors of Col. Stone, and\r\nby an honorable arrangement, liberty was obtained for the use made of\r\nthem, in the following pages. Acknowledgments are due also to others,\r\nwhose names will appear in the course of this work.\r\n\r\nTRACY, CAL., _April 12th_, 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nRed Jacket--Name widely known--Interest connected with his history--His\r\norigin--Development of his genius--Opinion of Capt.

Horatio Jones--Customs of\r\nhis people--Their love of eloquence--Distinguished orators among them--The\r\ninviting field opened.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the aborigines of this country, few names have excited a deeper\r\ninterest, or have been more widely and familiarly known than that of RED\r\nJACKET. The occasion of this notoriety was the rare fact that, though a\r\nrude and unlettered son of the forest, he was distinguished for the arts\r\nand accomplishments of the orator. His life marks an era in the history of\r\nhis nation and his name like that of Demosthenes, is forever associated\r\nwith eloquence.\r\n\r\nOther circumstances however, impart interest to his history. His was the\r\nlast great name of a nation, and he is entitled to remembrance, on the\r\nsoil which was once the home of his fathers. And though linked with a\r\nmelancholy association, as connected with the waning history of a people\r\nthat once laid a claim to greatness, but are now fast passing into\r\nobscurity, it is not on this account the less attractive, but presents\r\nanother reason for our regard.\r\n\r\nSuch was the name of SA-GO-YE-WAT-HA, or, as he has more commonly been\r\ncalled, Red Jacket. Having risen, by the force of his eloquence, from an\r\nobscure station to the highest rank among his people, he became\r\nconspicuous in all of those great transactions, in which they gradually\r\nrelinquished a title to their old hunting grounds, and gave place to the\r\nintrusive white man. And he lived to see his nation pass from the pride of\r\ntheir ancient dominion, to so humble an inheritance, that his last days\r\nwere embittered with the thought, that the _red men_ were destined to\r\nbecome extinct. With him has ceased the glory of their council fire, and\r\nof their name.\r\n\r\nHis origin, as we have intimated, was obscure. He must be introduced, as\r\nhe has come down to us, without rank or pedigree. His pedigree nature\r\nacknowledged, and gave him a right to become great among her sons. His\r\nbirth is a matter of fact, its time and place, circumstances of\r\nconjecture. Some affirm that he was born at the Old Seneca Castle, near\r\nthe foot of Seneca lake, not far from 1750. [Footnote: Hist. of North\r\nAmerican tribes by Thos. L. McKenney.]\r\n\r\nAnother tradition awards the honor of his birth to a place at, or near\r\nCanoga, on the banks of the Cayuga lake. [Footnote: Schoolcraft's Report.]\r\n\r\nWho were his parents? and what, his early history? As the wave casts upon\r\nthe shore some treasured fragment, and then recedes to mingle with its\r\nparent waters, so their names, and much of his early history have been\r\nlost in the oblivion of the past.\r\n\r\nSo likewise it is uncertain, as to the time when the wonderful powers of\r\nhis genius began to be developed, or as to the steps by which he arrived\r\nat the high distinction of orator among his people.\r\n\r\nWhether by dint of study he gained the requisite discipline of mind, and\r\nacquired that elegance of diction for which he was distinguished; whether\r\nby repeated trial and failure, accompanied by a proud ambition, and an\r\nunyielding purpose, he reached, like Demosthenes, the summit of his\r\naspirations; or, assisted more by nature than by art, emerged, like\r\nPatrick Henry at once, into the grand arena of mind, and by a single\r\neffort attained distinction and fame, is to be gathered more from\r\ncircumstances than from facts.\r\n\r\nIt is generally conceded, however, that the powers of his intellect were\r\nof the highest order. Captain Horatio Jones, the well known interpreter\r\nand agent among the Indians, and than whom no one was more intimately\r\nacquainted with this orator of the Seneca nation, was accustomed to speak\r\nof him as the greatest man that ever lived. \"For,\" said he, \"the great men\r\nof our own and of other times, have become so by education; but RED JACKET\r\nWAS AS NATURE MADE HIM. Had he enjoyed their advantages, he would have\r\nsurpassed them, since it can hardly be supposed that they, without these,\r\nwould have equalled him.\" [Footnote: Conversation of the author with Col.\r\nWm. Jones, of Geneseo, Livingston Co., N. Y., son of Capt. Horatio Jones.]\r\n\r\nSome allowance should be made for this statement, perhaps, on the ground\r\nthat Mr. Jones was a warm admirer of the orator's genius; yet his\r\nadmiration sprang from an intimate knowledge of him, seen under\r\ncircumstances, that afforded the best opportunity of forming a just\r\nopinion of his talents; and these, he maintained, \"_were among the noblest\r\nthat nature ever conferred upon man_.\"\r\n\r\nBut genius, while it may have smoothed the way, may not have spared him\r\nthe pains, by which ordinary minds ascend to greatness. For since it is so\r\nuniversally the fact, that the path to eminence, is rugged and steep, and\r\nthe gifts of fame seldom bestowed but in answer to repeated toil;\r\ncuriosity would inquire by what means one, who was reputed a barbarian,\r\ngained the highest distinction ever awarded to civilized man. It is not\r\nenough to reply simply, \"_that nature made him so_,\" or to receive,\r\nwithout qualification, his own proud assertion, \"I AM AN ORATOR, I WAS\r\nBORN AN ORATOR.\" The laws of mind are the same for peasants, and princes\r\nin intellect; great minds as well as small, must take measures to compass\r\ntheir object, or leave it unattained.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that his genius was sudden, or precocious in its\r\ndevelopment. It is said that his mind, naturally active and brilliant,\r\ngradually opened, until it reached its meridian splendor. Nor did his\r\npowers grow without any means to mature and perfect them. As the young oak\r\nis strengthened by warring with the storm, so the faculties of his mind\r\ngained force by entering freely into conflicts of opinion. Accustomed to\r\ncanvass in private the questions which agitated the councils of his\r\nnation, he began to ascertain the reality of his own power, and by\r\nmeasuring his own with other minds, he gained the confidence that flows\r\nfrom superior wisdom. [Footnote: Conversation with Col. Wm. Jones.]\r\n\r\nThe tastes and regulations of his own people favored very much, the\r\npromptings of his genius. They were lovers of eloquence, and their form of\r\ngovernment fostered its cultivation. This though differing but little from\r\nthe simplicity found in rude states of society, presented a feature\r\npeculiar among a people not far advanced in civilization, which served\r\ngreatly to promote elevation of mind, and advance them far above a\r\ncondition of barbarism. They were in the habit of meeting in public\r\nassemblies, to discuss those questions that pertained to the interests, or\r\ndestiny of their nation. Around their council fires their chiefs and\r\nwarriors gathered, and entered freely, so far as their dignity,\r\nconsideration, or power of debate admitted, into a deliberation on public\r\naffairs. And here were manifested an ability and decorum which civilized\r\nnations even, have viewed with admiration and surprise. For though we\r\nmight suppose their eloquence must have partaken of rant and rhapsody,\r\npresenting a mass of incoherent ideas, depending for their interest on the\r\nanimation of gesture and voice, with which they were uttered, yet we would\r\ndo injustice to their memory, if we did not give their orators the credit\r\nof speaking as much to the purpose, and of exhibiting as great a force of\r\nintellect, as many who would claim a higher place than they in the scale\r\nof intelligence and refinement.\r\n\r\nMany of their orators were distinguished for strength of mind, and in\r\nnative power of genius, might compare favorably, with the men of any age\r\nor clime. The names of Garangula, Adario, Hendrick, Skenandoah, Logan and\r\nothers, might be mentioned with pride by any people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING HENDRICK]\r\n\r\nGARANGULA, has been styled the very Nestor of his nation, whose powers of\r\nmind would not suffer in comparison with a Roman, or more modern Senator.\r\n[Footnote: Drake.]\r\n\r\nADARIO is said to have been a man of \"great mind, the bravest of the\r\nbrave,\" and possessing altogether the best qualities of any Indian known\r\nto the French in Canada. [Footnote: Charlevoix.]\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked of HENDRICK, that for capacity, bravery, vigor of\r\nmind, and immovable integrity united, he excelled all the aboriginal\r\ninhabitants of the United States, of whom any knowledge has come down to\r\nthe present time. [Footnote: Dr. Dwight.]\r\n\r\nSKENANDOAH in his youth was a brave and intrepid warrior, and in his riper\r\nyears one of the best of counsellors among the North American tribes. He\r\npossessed a most vigorous mind, and was alike active, sagacious, and\r\npersevering. He will long be remembered for a saying of his to one who\r\nvisited him toward the close of life; \"I am,\" said he, \"an aged hemlock,\r\nthe winds of an hundred winters have whistled through my branches. I am\r\ndead at the top. The generation to which I belonged has run away and left\r\nme.\" He was a sincere believer in the Christian religion, and added to the\r\nabove \"why I live the Great and Good Spirit only knows. Pray to my Jesus,\r\nthat I may have patience to wait for my appointed time to die.\" [Footnote:\r\nAnnals of Tryon County.]\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Jefferson regarded the appeal of LOGAN to the white men, after the\r\nextirpation of his family, as without a parallel in the history of\r\neloquence.\r\n\r\nThese were men who have been revered by the civilized world, as worthy of\r\na place with the distinguished and great among mankind.\r\n\r\n\"Oratory was not alone a natural gift, but an art among the Iroquois. It\r\nenjoined painful study, unremitting practice, and sedulous observation of\r\nthe style, and methods of the best masters. Red Jacket did not rely upon\r\nhis native powers alone, but cultivated the art with the same assiduity\r\nthat characterized the great Athenian orator. The Iroquois, as their\r\nearliest English historian observed, cultivated an Attic or classic\r\nelegance of speech, which entranced every ear, among their red auditory.\"\r\n[Footnote: Mr. Bryant's speech.]\r\n\r\nThose public games, entertainments, religious ceremonies and dances,\r\ncommon among the Indian tribes, added interest to their council\r\ngatherings, and made them a scene of attraction for the entire nation.\r\nThither the young and old of both sexes were accustomed to resort, and,\r\nassembled at their national forum, listened with profound attention and\r\nsilence to each word spoken by their orators. \"The unvarying courtesy,\r\nsobriety and dignity of their convocations led one of their learned Jesuit\r\nhistorians to liken them to the Roman Senate.\" [Footnote: W. C. Bryant's\r\nspeech before the Buffalo Historical Society on the occasion of the re-\r\ninterment of Red Jacket's remains.]\r\n\r\n\"Their language was flexible and sonorous, the sense largely depending\r\nupon inflection, copious in vowel sounds, abounding in metaphor; affording\r\nconstant opportunity for the ingenious combination and construction of\r\nwords to image delicate, and varying shades of thought, and to express\r\nvehement manifestations of passion; admitting of greater and more sudden\r\nvariations in pitch, than is permissable in English oratory, and\r\nencouraging pantomimic gesture, for greater force and effect. In other\r\nwords it was not a cold, artificial, mechanical medium for the expression\r\nof thought or emotion, or the concealment of either, but was constructed,\r\nas we may fancy, much as was the tuneful tongue spoken by our first\r\nparents, who stood in even closer relations to nature.\" [Footnote: Ib.]\r\n\r\nHence, though the Iroquois were a warlike people, and delighted in deeds\r\nof bravery, there was an inviting field opened to one, who could chain\r\ntheir attention by his eloquence, and sway their emotions at will.\r\n\r\nSuch advantages being presented for the exercise of the powers of oratory,\r\nit can hardly be supposed that a mind endowed as richly, as was Red\r\nJacket's, by the gifts of nature, would fail to perceive the path in which\r\nlay the true road to eminence among his people. And his subsequent career\r\nindicates but too clearly, the choice he made of the field in which to\r\nexercise his noble powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nGlance at the early history of the Iroquois--The territory occupied--\r\nTuscaroras--Original strength--Traditions--Probable course of migration--\r\nThe Senecas--Story of their origin--Singular romance.\r\n\r\n\r\nRising up from the obscurity of the past, we find a people, singular in\r\ntheir habits and character, whose history has been strangely, and in some\r\nrespects sadly interwoven with our own. They were the original occupants\r\nof the soil, claiming to have lived here always, and to have grown out of\r\nthe soil like the trees of the forest. Scattered over this continent were\r\nvarious Indian tribes, resembling each other in their general features and\r\nhabits, but in some instances exhibiting stronger and more interesting\r\ntraits of character than the others. Among these were the Iroquois, and if\r\nRed Jacket was distinguished among his own people, his own people were not\r\nless conspicuous among the North American Indians.\r\n\r\nHe sprang from the Senecas, and was accustomed to speak of his origin with\r\nfeelings of conscious pride. For the Senecas were the most numerous and\r\npowerful of the six nations, of whom they were a part. Such was the title\r\ngiven to that celebrated Indian confederacy which, for a length of time\r\nunknown to us, inhabited the territory embraced by the State of New York.\r\n\r\nHere they lived in a line of settlements extending from one end to the\r\nother, through the middle of the State, and their domain as thus occupied,\r\nthey were accustomed to style their _Long House_. It was a shadowy\r\ndome, of generous amplitude, covered by the azure expanse above, garnished\r\nwith hills, lakes, and laughing streams, and well stored with provisions,\r\nin the elk and deer that bounded freely through its forest halls, the\r\nmoose that was mirrored in its waters, and the trout, those luscious\r\nspeckled beauties, that nestled cosily in its crystal chambers.\r\n\r\nThe eastern door was guarded by the Mohawks, who resided at one, and its\r\nwestern by the Senecas, who dwelt at the other extremity of this abode.\r\n\r\nWhen ever a messenger from another nation came to them on business, or\r\nknocked, as it was termed, at the eastern or western door of their _long\r\nhouse_, it was the duty of the nation to which he came, to give him\r\nentertainment, and examine into the nature of his embassy. If it was of\r\nsmall importance, it was decided by their own council; but if it was such\r\nas to demand the united wisdom of the tribes, a runner was sent with a\r\nbelt of wampum to the nearest nation, which would take the belt and send a\r\nrunner with it to the next, and so on, and thus with but little delay, a\r\ngeneral meeting was summoned of all the tribes.\r\n\r\nThis confederacy at one time consisted of five nations, but afterward\r\nembraced six, by the addition of the Tuscaroras, a tribe that once\r\noccupied the territory of North Carolina.\r\n\r\nThis tribe is said to have belonged at an early day to the Iroquois\r\nfamily, and to have inherited the enterprising and warlike character of\r\nthe parent stock. They fought successfully with the Catawbas, Cowetas, and\r\nthe Cherokees, and thought to exterminate by one decisive blow, all of the\r\nwhite inhabitants within their borders. Unsuccessful in the attempt,\r\npressed sorely by the whites, who resisted the attack, and unwilling\r\nthemselves to submit, they removed to the north, and through sympathy,\r\nsimilarity of taste, manners, or language, or from the stronger motives of\r\nconsanguinity, became incorporated with the confederated tribes of the\r\nIroquois. [Footnote: Schoolcraft's Report. Mr. Schoolcraft prefers, and\r\nquite justly the name Iroquois, as descriptive of this confederacy,\r\ninstead of Six Nations, since the term is well known, and applicable to\r\nthem in every part of their history. Whereas the other is appropriate only\r\nduring the time when they were numerically six.]\r\n\r\nThus constituted they presented the most formidable power, of which we\r\nhave any knowledge in the annals of the Indian race. By their united\r\nstrength they were able to repel invasion, from any of the surrounding\r\nnations, and by the force of their arms and their prowess in war, gained\r\ncontrol over an extent of territory much greater than they occupied.\r\n\r\nThey sent their war parties in every direction. The tribes north, east,\r\nsouth, and west of them were made to feel the power of their arms, and\r\nyield successively to their dexterity and valor. Now they were launching\r\ntheir war-canoes upon the lakes and rivers of the west, now engaged in\r\nbloody conflicts with the Catawbas and Cherokees of the south, now\r\ntraversing regions of snow in pursuit of the Algonquins of the north, and\r\nanon spreading consternation and dread among the tribes at the remotest\r\neast. Their energy and warlike prowess made them a terror to their foes,\r\nand distant nations pronounced their name with awe.\r\n\r\nBy what means these several tribes had been brought to unite themselves\r\nunder one government, how long they had existed in this relation, and what\r\nwas the origin of each one, or of all, are questions which will never\r\nperhaps be fully determined. There being no written records among them,\r\nall that can be ascertained of their history previous to their becoming\r\nknown to the whites, must be gathered from the dim light of tradition,\r\nfrom their symbolic representations, from antique remains of their art,\r\nand from their legends and myths. These present in an obscure and shadowy\r\nform, a few materials of history, whose value is to be measured by the\r\nconsideration, that they are all we have to tell the story of a noble and\r\ninteresting race of men.\r\n\r\nTheir traditions speak of the creation of the world, the formation of man,\r\nand the destruction of the world by a deluge. They suppose the existence\r\noriginally of two worlds, an upper and lower. The upper completed and\r\nfilled with an intelligent order of beings, the lower unformed and\r\nchaotic, whose surface was covered with water, in which huge monsters\r\ncareered, uncontrolled and wild. From the upper there descended to the\r\nlower a creating spirit, in the form of a beautiful woman. She alighted on\r\nthe back of a huge tortoise, gave birth to a pair of male twins and\r\nexpired. Thereupon the shell of the tortoise began to enlarge, and grew\r\nuntil it became a \"_big island_\" and formed this continent.\r\n\r\nThese two infant sons became, one the author of _good_, the other of\r\n_evil_. The creator of _good_ formed whatever was praiseworthy and useful.\r\nFrom the head of his deceased mother he made the sun, from the remaining\r\nparts of her body, the moon and stars. When these were created the water-\r\nmonsters were terrified by the light, and fled and hid themselves in the\r\ndepths of the ocean. He diversified the earth by making rivers, seas\r\nand plains, covered it with animals, and filled it with productions\r\nbeneficial to mankind. He then formed man and woman, put life into them,\r\nand called them Ong-we Hon-we _a real people_. [Footnote: This term is\r\nsignificant of true manhood. It implies that there was nothing of sham in\r\ntheir make up.]\r\n\r\nThe creator of _evil_ was active in making mountains, precipices,\r\nwaterfalls, reptiles, morasses, apes, and whatever was injurious to, or in\r\nmockery of mankind. He put the works of the _good_ out of order, hid\r\nhis animals in the earth, and destroyed things necessary for the\r\nsustenance of man. His conduct so awakened the displeasure of the _good_,\r\nas to bring them into personal conflict. Their time of combat, and arms\r\nwere chosen, one selecting flag-roots, the other the horns of a deer. Two\r\nwhole days they were engaged in unearthly combat; but finally the _Maker\r\nof Good_, who had chosen the horns of a deer, prevailed, and retired to\r\nthe world above. The _Maker of Evil_ sank below to a region of darkness,\r\nand became the _Evil Spirit_, or Kluneolux of the world of despair.\r\n[Footnote: Schoolcraft's Indian Cosmogony.]\r\n\r\nMany of their accounts appear to be purely fabulous, but not more so\r\nperhaps than similar traditions, to be found in the history of almost\r\nevery nation.\r\n\r\nThe Iroquois refer their origin to a point near Oswego Falls. They boldly\r\naffirm that their people were here taken from a subterranean vault, by the\r\nDivine Being, and conducted eastward along the river Ye-no-na-nat-che,\r\n_going around a mountain_, now the Mohawk, until they came to where it\r\ndischarges into a great river running toward the mid-day sun, the Hudson,\r\nand went down this river and touched the bank of a _great water_, while\r\nthe main body returned by the way they came, and as they proceeded\r\nwestward, originated the different tribes composing their nation; and to\r\neach tribe was assigned the territory they occupied, when first discovered\r\nby the whites. [Footnote: Account by David Cusick, as contained in\r\nSchoolcraft's report. Mr. S. regards this account correct as indicating\r\nthe probable course of their migrations.]\r\n\r\nThe Senecas, the fifth tribe of the Iroquois, were directed in their\r\noriginal location, to occupy a hill near the head of Canandaigua lake.\r\nThis hill, called Ge-nun-de-wa, is venerated as the birth place of their\r\nnation. It was surrounded anciently by a rude fortification which formed\r\ntheir dwelling in time of peace, and served for a shelter from any sudden\r\nattack of a hostile tribe. Tradition hallows this spot on account of the\r\nfollowing very remarkable occurrence.\r\n\r\nFar back in the past, the inhabitants of the hill Genundewa, were\r\nsurprised on awaking one morning, to behold themselves surrounded by an\r\nimmense serpent. His dimensions were so vast as to enable him to coil\r\nhimself completely around the fort. His head and tail came together at its\r\ngate. There he lay writhing and hissing, presenting a most menacing and\r\nhideous aspect. His jaws were widely extended, and he hissed so terribly\r\nno one ventured to approach near.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants were thus effectually blockaded. Some endeavored, but in\r\nvain, to kill this savage monster. Others tried to escape, but his\r\nwatchful eyes prevented their endeavors. Others again sought to climb over\r\nhis body, but were unable; while others still attempted to pass by his\r\nhead, but fell into his extended jaws. Their confinement grew every day\r\nmore and more painful, and was rendered doubly annoying by the serpent's\r\nbreath, which was very offensive.\r\n\r\nTheir situation drove them at length to an extremity not to be endured.\r\nThey armed themselves with hatchets, and clubs, and whatever implements of\r\nwar they could find, and made a vigorous sally upon their dreadful foe,\r\nbut, alas! were all engulfed in his terrific jaws.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that two orphan children remained, after the destruction\r\nwhich befell the rest. They were directed by an oracle to make a bow of a\r\ncertain kind of willow, and an arrow of the same, the point of which they\r\nwere to dip in poison, and then shoot the monster, aiming so as to hit him\r\nunder his scales.\r\n\r\nIn doing this, they encountered their adversary with entire success. For\r\nno sooner had the arrow penetrated his skin, than he presently began to\r\ngrow sick, exhibiting signs of the deepest distress. He threw himself into\r\nevery imaginable shape, and with wonderful contortions and agonizing\r\npains, rolled his ponderous body down along the declivity of the mountain,\r\nuttering horrid noises as he went, prostrating trees in his course, and\r\nfalling finally into the lake below.\r\n\r\nHere he slaked his thirst, and showed signs of great distress, by dashing\r\nabout furiously in the water. Soon he vomited up the heads of those whom\r\nhe had swallowed, and immediately after expired and sank to rise no more.\r\n[Footnote: As related to the author by Col. Wm. Jones.]\r\n\r\nFrom these two children, as thus preserved, the Seneca nation are said to\r\nhave sprung.\r\n\r\nSo implicitly has this tradition been received by the Senecas, that it has\r\nbeen incorporated into the solemnities of their worship, and its\r\nremembrance continued from one generation to another by the aid of\r\nreligious rites. Here they were formerly in the habit of assembling in\r\ncouncil, and here their prayers and thanksgivings were offered to the\r\nGreat Spirit, for having given them birth, and for rescuing their nation\r\nfrom entire destruction.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of this to the whites, they point to the barren hillside, as\r\nevincing the truth of the story, affirming that one day the forest trees\r\nstood thick upon it, but was stripped of them by the great serpent as he\r\nrolled down its declivity. The round stones found there in great\r\nabundance, resembling in size and shape the human head, are taken as\r\nadditional proof, for they affirm that these are the heads disgorged by\r\nthe serpent, and have been petrified by the waters of the lake. [Footnote:\r\nThe author remembers well that in conversation with a Seneca Indian on\r\nthis point, he seemed to take it as quite an affront that doubts should be\r\nexpressed by the white people as to the reality of this occurrence.]\r\n\r\nIf nearness of locality will justify a glance of the eye for a moment, to\r\nan object not directly in the line of our pursuit, we might survey in\r\npassing a bold projecting height, not far from the hill Genundewa, marked\r\nby a legend which draws a tear from the eye of the dusky warrior, or sends\r\nhim away in a thoughtful mood, with a shade of sadness upon his usually\r\nplacid brow. The story is not of the same character and is of a more\r\nrecent date than that of the serpent, but is said to be of great\r\nantiquity. It has been written with great beauty by Col. Stone, and as we\r\nare authorized, we present it in his own language.\r\n\r\n\"During the wars of the Senecas and Algonquins of the north, a chief of\r\nthe latter was captured and carried to Genundewa, whereon a fortification,\r\nconsisting of a square without bastions, and surrounded by palisades, was\r\nsituated. The captive though young in years, was famed for his prowess in\r\nthe forest conflict, and nature had been bountiful to his person in those\r\ngifts of strength and symmetry, which awaken savage admiration. After a\r\nshort debate he was condemned to die on the following day, by the slow\r\ntorture of empalement. While he was thus lying in the cabin of death, a\r\nlodge devoted to condemned prisoners, the daughter of the sachem brought\r\nhim food, and struck with his manly form and heroic bearing, resolved to\r\nsave him or share his fate. Her bold enterprise was favored by the\r\nuncertain light of the gray dawn, while the solitary sentinel, weary of\r\nhis night-watch, and forgetful of his duty, was slumbering. Stealing with\r\nnoiseless tread to the side of the young captive, she cut the thongs\r\nwherewith his limbs were bound, and besought him in breathless accents to\r\nfollow her.\r\n\r\n\"The fugitives descended the hill by a wooded path conducting to the lake;\r\nbut ere they reached the water, an alarm whoop, wild and shrill, was heard\r\nissuing from the waking guard. They tarried not, though thorny vines and\r\nfallen timber obstructed their way. At length they reached the smooth\r\nbeach, and leaping into a canoe previously provided by the considerate\r\ndamsel, they plied the paddle vigorously, steering for the opposite shore.\r\nVain were their efforts. On the wind came cries of rage, and the quick\r\ntramp of savage warriors, bounding over rock and glen in fierce pursuit.\r\nThe Algonquin with the reckless daring of a young brave, sent back a yell\r\nof defiance, and soon after the splash of oars was heard, and a dozen war\r\ncanoes were cutting the billows in their rear. The unfortunate lovers on\r\nlanding, took a trail leading in a western direction over the hills. The\r\nAlgonquin, weakened by unhealed wounds, followed his active guide up the\r\naclivity, with panting heart and flagging pace; while his enemies, with\r\nthe grim old sachem at their head, drew nearer and nearer. At length\r\nfinding further attempts at flight useless, she diverged from the trail,\r\nand conducted her lover to a table-crested rock that projected over a\r\nravine or gulf, one hundred and fifty feet in depth, the bottom of which\r\nwas strewed with misshapen rocks, scattered in rude confusion. With hearts\r\nnerved to a high resolve, the hapless pair awaited the arrival of their\r\nyelling pursuers. Conspicuous by his eagle plume, towering form and\r\nscowling brow, the daughter soon descried her inexorable sire, leaping\r\nfrom crag to crag below her. He paused abruptly when his fiery eye rested\r\non the objects of his pursuit. Notching an arrow on the string of his\r\ntried and unerring bow, he raised his sinewy arms--but ere the missile was\r\nsent, Wun-nut-hay, _the Beautiful_, interposed her form between her father\r\nand his victim. In wild appealing tones she entreated her sire to spare\r\nthe young chieftain, assuring him that they would leap together from the\r\nprecipice rather than be separated. The stern old man, deaf to her\r\nsupplication, and disregarding her menace, ordered his followers to seize\r\nthe fugitive. Warrior after warrior darted up the rock, but on reaching\r\nthe platform, at the moment when they were grasping to clutch the young\r\nbrave, the lovers, locked in fond embrace, flung themselves\r\n\r\n  'From the steep rock, and perished.'\r\n\r\n\"The mangled bodies were buried in the bottom of the glen, beneath the\r\nshade of everlasting rocks; and two small hollows, resembling sunken\r\ngraves, are to this day pointed out to the curious traveler, as the burial\r\nplace of the lovers.\" It is a sweet, wild haunt, the sunbeams fall there\r\nwith softened radiance, and a brook near by gives out a complaining\r\nmurmur, as if mourning for the dead. [Footnote: Mr. Stone adds in a note--\r\n\"This interesting legend was derived many years ago from a Seneca chief of\r\nsome note, named Chequered Cap, and was communicated to me by W. H. C.\r\nHosmer, Esq., of Avon. On the top of Genundewa the remains of an Indian\r\norchard are visible, a few moss-grown and wind-bowed apple trees still\r\nlinger, sad, but fitting emblems of the wasted race by whom they were\r\nplanted.\"]\r\n\r\nLet us return to the inquiry we were pursuing. Of the origin of the\r\nIroquois confederacy, some traditionary accounts have been given, which\r\nrepresent the different tribes as dwelling for a time, in the separate\r\nlocations assigned them, independent of each other. Here they increased in\r\nvalor, skill and knowledge, suited to their forest home. At length\r\nbecoming numerous, rival interests arose among them, which did not exist\r\nwhen they were small and feeble. They fell into contention, and wasted and\r\ndestroyed each other. Each tribe fortified his own position, and dwelt in\r\nconstant fear of being surprised and overcome by his neighboring foe.\r\n\r\nAt length one of their sachems, distinguished for his wisdom and address,\r\nproposed that they should cease from a strife, which was only destroying\r\nthemselves, and unite their energies against the Alleghans, the\r\nAdirondacks, the Eries, and other ancient and warlike tribes, who were\r\ntheir superiors in their isolated and divided condition. Already weary of\r\ntheir unprofitable conflicts, the proposal was received with favor, and\r\nAto-tar-ho, an Onandaga chieftain, unequalled in valor, and the fame of\r\nwhose skill and daring was known among all the tribes, became the leading\r\nspirit of this confederacy, and by common consent was placed at its head.\r\nSo fully did experience demonstrate the wisdom of this arrangement, that\r\nthey used every means to strengthen the bands of their union, and by the\r\nmost solemn engagements of fidelity to each other, they became the Ko-nos-\r\nhi-o-ni, or United people. [Footnote: Schoolcraft's Report.]\r\n\r\nHow long this confederacy had existed before their discovery by the\r\nwhites, is unknown. There is a tradition which places it one age, or the\r\nlength of a man's life, before the white people came to this country.\r\n[Footnote: Pyrlaus, a missionary at the ancient site of Dionderoga, or\r\nFort Hunter, writing between 1742 and 1748, gives this as the best\r\nconjecture he could form, from information derived from the Mohawks. It is\r\nthought however that this time is too short, to account for the degree of\r\ndevelopment attained by the Iroquois, in their united capacity, at the\r\ntime of their first discovery by the whites.]\r\n\r\nThe union of these several tribes was the means of securing their pre-\r\neminence over the other Indians in this country. Their individual traits\r\nare thus very fittingly represented;--\"in their firm physical type, and in\r\ntheir energy of character, and love of independence, no people among the\r\naboriginal race have ever exceeded, if any has equalled the Iroquois.\"\r\n[Footnote: Schoolcraft.] They occupied a region surpassed by no other on\r\nthe continent, for grandeur and beauty united, and inherited from this or\r\nsome other source, a mental constitution of noble structure, which placed\r\nthem in the fore-front of their race, and when united, no tribe on this\r\ncontinent could stand before them. This has served to render their\r\nhistory, a matter of earnest and interesting inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nName Red Jacket, how acquired--Indian name--Conferred name--Singular\r\ntradition--Red Jacket during the war of the Revolution--Neutrality of the\r\nIndians--Services sought by Great Britain--Sketch of Sir William Johnson--\r\nPosition of Red Jacket--Taunt of cowardice--Testimony of Little Beard--\r\nCharge made by Brant--Red Jacket's indifference--Anecdote--Early love of\r\neloquence--Interesting reminiscences.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name Red Jacket, so familiar to the whites, was acquired during the\r\nwar of the Revolution. He was distinguished at this time as well as\r\nafterward, for his fleetness on foot, his intelligence and activity.\r\nHaving attracted the attention of a British officer by the vivacity of his\r\nmanners, and the speedy execution of those errands with which he was\r\nintrusted, he received either in token of admiration, or for services\r\nrendered, or both, a beautifully ornamented jacket of a scarlet color.\r\n\r\nThis he took pride in wearing, and when worn out, he was presented with\r\nanother, and continued to wear this peculiar dress until it became a mark\r\nof distinction, and gave him the name by which he was afterward best\r\nknown. At a treaty held at Canandaigua in 1794, Captain Parrish, who was\r\nfor many years agent of the United States for the Indians, presented him\r\nwith another _red jacket_ to perpetuate a name of which he was\r\nparticularly fond. [Footnote: McKenney's Indian Biography Politely favored\r\nby Alfred B. Street, Esq., and assistant Mr. J. H. Hickox, of the State\r\nLibrary, Albany, N. Y.]\r\n\r\nHis original name was Oti-ti-ani, _always ready_. Sa-go-ye-wat-ha, the\r\ntitle conferred upon him at his election to the dignity of Sachem, has\r\nbeen rendered, \"_The keeper awake, he keeps them awake, and the author, or\r\ncause of a wakeful spirit_.\" [Footnote: This latter translation was\r\ngiven to the author by the late Wm. Jones, a half-blood, son-in-law of Red\r\nJacket and a chief of some note. This interpretation was given to some\r\ngentlemen from Buffalo who proposed to erect a monument at Red Jacket's\r\ngrave. It was given in a full council of the chiefs of his tribe.]\r\n\r\nThe name is connected with a curious superstition among his people, and\r\nwill best be understood, by an acquaintance with the circumstances under\r\nwhich it is used.\r\n\r\nIf during the still hours of night, an Indian's mind is taken up with\r\nthoughts that cause sleep to pass from him, preventing every effort of\r\nMorpheus to lock him in fond embrace, he ascribes it to a spirit, which he\r\ncalls Sa-go-ye-wat-ha.\r\n\r\nThe impressions made are regarded as ominous of some important event,\r\njoyful or otherwise, according to the feelings awakened. If his thoughts\r\nare of a pleasing nature, he is led to anticipate the occurrence of some\r\njoyful event. If they are of a melancholy turn, he regards it as\r\nforeboding evil.\r\n\r\nHe may be led to dwell with interest on some absent friend; that friend he\r\nwill expect to see the next day, or soon after. Yet should his thoughts be\r\ntroubled or anxious, he would expect to hear soon of that friend's death,\r\nor that something evil had befallen him. [Footnote: Conversation with Wm.\r\nJones, Seneca chief.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the spirit they called Sa-go-ye-wat-ha. He could arrest the\r\ncurrent of their thought, bring before them visions of delight, or send\r\nupon them melancholy reflections, and fill their minds with anxiety and\r\ngloom.\r\n\r\nThis title conferred on Red Jacket, while it indicated the cause of his\r\nelevation, presented the highest compliment that could be paid to his\r\npowers of oratory. By the magic spell of his words, he could control their\r\nminds, make their hearts beat quick with emotions of joy, or send over\r\nthem at will the deep pulsations of grief.\r\n\r\nThe incident referred to as giving rise to the name, Red Jacket,\r\nintroduces him in connection with the war of the Revolution. As his\r\nconduct during this period has been the subject of frequent remark,\r\nseverely criticised by some, and not very favorably viewed by others,\r\njustice to the orator's memory requires a brief statement of his reasons\r\nfor the course he pursued.\r\n\r\nWhile thoughts of this contest were pending, the colonists took measures\r\nto secure the favorable disposition of the Iroquois, and these efforts at\r\nthe time were successful.\r\n\r\nThe general government advised them to remain neutral, during the\r\nanticipated conflict. This course met the approval of their most\r\nconsiderate sachems. For though inured to war, and apt to enter with\r\navidity into the excitement of a conflict, their forces had been reduced\r\nby recent encounters with the Indians at the west, and south, and also\r\nwith the French; and the few intervening years of peace served to convince\r\nthem of its value, and caused them to receive with favor this proposition\r\nfrom our government.\r\n\r\nAt a council held with the Iroquois at German Flats, in June, 1776, by\r\nGen. Schuyler, who had been appointed for this purpose, these assurances\r\nof neutrality were renewed.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain also was not indifferent about the course these Indian\r\ntribes would pursue. Wishing to prevent an alliance of the Indians with\r\nthe colonists, willing to secure forces already on the ground, and with a\r\nview possibly, of striking terror into the minds of her rebellious\r\nsubjects, her agents in this country spared no pains to enlist the\r\nsympathies of the Iroquois on her side.\r\n\r\nIn this they were but too successful. Through their agents, Britain had\r\nbeen in correspondence with these tribes for more than a hundred years,\r\nhad supplied them with implements of war, articles of clothing, and with\r\nmany of the comforts and conveniences of life. The Indians had learned to\r\nbe dependent upon her, and they called her king their \"_great father_\r\nover the water.\" Her agents spent their lives among them. Through them\r\ntheir communications were made to the crown, and they regarded them as\r\nessential to their happiness. Hence they exerted a very great influence\r\nover them.\r\n\r\nThis was especially true of Sir William Johnson, who died at Johnson Hall\r\nin the month of June, 1774.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson was a native of Ireland, of a good family and fitted by nature\r\nand education, to adorn the walks of civilized life. He came to this\r\ncountry not far from 1738, as land agent of his uncle, Sir Peter Warren,\r\nan admiral in the English navy, who had acquired a considerable tract of\r\nland upon the Mohawk, in the present county of Montgomery.\r\n\r\nPossessing a romantic disposition, he readily adapted himself to the rude\r\ncustoms that prevailed in the wilds of America.\r\n\r\nThe _Gentleman's Magazine_ of London said of him in 1755,--\"Besides\r\nhis skill and experience as an officer, he is particularly happy in making\r\nhimself beloved by all sorts of people, and can conform to all companies\r\nand to all conversations. He is very much of a gentleman in genteel\r\ncompany, but as the inhabitants next to him are mostly Dutch, he sits down\r\nwith them and smokes his tobacco, drinks flip, and talks of improvements,\r\nbear and beaver skins. Being surrounded with Indians, he speaks several of\r\ntheir languages well, and has always some of them with him. He takes care\r\nof their wives, and old Indians, when they go out on parties; and even\r\nwears their dress. In short, by his honest dealings with them in trade,\r\nand his courage, which has often been successfully tried with them, he has\r\nso endeared himself to them, that they chose him as one of their chief\r\nsachems, or princes, and esteem him as their father.\"\r\n\r\nNot far from the year 1755, while the French and English were at war, he\r\nwas made general of the colonial militia, and by virtue of a leadership\r\nthat had been created by the Iroquois, he was head warrior of all the\r\nIndian tribes, who favored the English.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHNSON HALL]\r\n\r\nThe gifts of his sovereign, and the opportunity he had of purchasing\r\nIndian lands, were the means of his securing great wealth. The ease with\r\nwhich he secured land of the Indians is illustrated by an amusing\r\noccurrence between him and a noted chief, Hendrick. Soon after entering\r\nupon his duties as Superintendent of Indian Affairs in this country, he\r\nreceived from England some richly embroidered suits of clothes.\r\n\r\nHendrick, a Mohawk chief, was present, when the package containing them\r\nwas opened, and could not refrain from expressing his admiration of them.\r\nHe went away very thoughtful, but soon after returned and said to Sir\r\nWilliam, that he had dreamed a dream.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! And what did you dream?\" said Sir William.\r\n\r\n\"I dreamed,\" said Hendrick, \"that you gave me one of those new suits of\r\nuniform.\"\r\n\r\nSir William could not refuse it, and one of the elegant suits was\r\npresented to Hendrick, who went away to show his gift to his countrymen\r\nand left Sir William to tell the joke to his friends. A while after the\r\ngeneral met Hendrick and said--\"Hendrick, _I have dreamed a dream_.\"\r\n\r\nWhether the Sachem mistrusted he was now to be taken in his own net or\r\nnot, is not certain, but he also inquired,--\"And what did you dream?\"\r\n\r\nThe general said he dreamed that Hendrick presented him with a certain\r\npiece of land which he described. It consisted of about five hundred\r\nacres, of the most valuable land in the Mohawk valley.\r\n\r\nHendrick replied,--\"It is yours;\" but, shaking his head, said, \"Sir\r\nWilliam I will never dream with you again.\" [Footnote: Drake's Book of the\r\nIndians.]\r\n\r\nSir William's large estate, the partiality of his countrymen, together\r\nwith his military honors, and his great influence with the Indians,\r\nrendered him \"as near a prince as anything the back-woods of America has\r\nwitnessed.\" [Footnote: The expression of an English lady.--Turner.]\r\n\r\nHe built two spacious and convenient residences on the Mohawk river, known\r\nas Johnson Castle and Johnson Hall. The Hall was his summer residence.\r\nHere he lived something like a sovereign, kept an excellent table for\r\nstrangers and officers, whom the course of duty led into these wilds, and\r\nby confiding entirely in the Indians, and treating them with truth and\r\njustice, never yielding to solicitations once refused, they were taught to\r\nrepose in him the utmost confidence.\r\n\r\nHis personal popularity with the Indians, gave him an influence over them\r\ngreater it is supposed, than any one of our own race has ever possessed.\r\nHe was the first Englishman that contended successfully with French Indian\r\ndiplomacy, as exercised by their governors, missionaries and traders.\r\n[Footnote: Turner's Phelps and Gorham Purchase.]\r\n\r\nHad he lived until the war of the Revolution, it is supposed by some he\r\nmight have remained neutral, and have kept the Indians from engaging in\r\nthe conflict, though this is altogether uncertain. He lived to see the\r\ngathering of the storm that swept away most of his great possessions.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Sir William, his son John Johnson succeeded to his titles\r\nand estate. The office of General Superintendent of the Indians, fell into\r\nthe hands of Col. Guy Johnson, a son-in-law, who appointed Col. Claus,\r\nanother son-in-law, as his deputy.\r\n\r\nInto their hands fell the property, and a large share of the influence\r\nover the Indians, possessed by Sir William Johnson. This influence was\r\nexerted in favor of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nWhen the Indians heard of the uprising in Boston, and of the battle of\r\nLexington, they were told, that these out-breaks were the acts of\r\ndisobedient children, against the great king, who had been kind to them,\r\nas he had to the Six Nations. That their \"_great father over the water_,\"\r\nwas rich in money and men; that the colonists were poor, and their numbers\r\nsmall, and that they could easily be brought into subjection.\r\n\r\nAt a council of the Iroquois convened at Oswego, by Sir John Johnson and\r\nother officers and friends of the crown, they were informed that the king\r\ndesired them to assist him in subduing the rebels, who had taken up arms\r\nagainst him, and were about to rob him of a part of his great possessions.\r\n\r\nBut the chiefs one by one assured the British agents that they had the\r\nyear before, in a council with General Schuyler, pledged themselves to\r\nneutrality, and could not without violating their promise, take up the\r\nhatchet.\r\n\r\nBut they were assured that the rebels justly merited all the punishment\r\nthat white men and Indians could inflict;--that they would be richly\r\nrewarded for their services, and _that the king's rum was as plenty as\r\nthe waters of Lake Ontario_.\r\n\r\nThis appeal to their appetites, already vitiated, together with the\r\npromise of large rewards, at length prevailed; and a treaty was concluded,\r\nin which the Indians pledged themselves to take up arms against the\r\nrebels, and continue in service during the war. They were then presented\r\neach with a suit of clothes, a brass kettle, a gun, a tomahawk, a scalping\r\nknife, a quantity of powder and lead, and a piece of gold. [Footnote: Life\r\nof Mary Jemison.]\r\n\r\nThe Senecas were among those who consented to join the royal standard. Of\r\nthis action Red Jacket did not approve. He declared plainly and\r\nunhesitatingly to those who had determined to engage in the war,--\"_This\r\nquarrel does not belong to us,--and it is test for us to take no part in\r\nit; we need not waste our blood to have it settled. If they fight us, we\r\nwill fight them, but if they let us alone, we had better keep still_.\"\r\n[Footnote: Testimony given to the author by Wm. Jones, Seneca chief, and\r\nconfirmed by Col. Wm. Jones, son of the Indian interpreter, who affirms\r\nthat prominent Indian chiefs had declared in his hearing that these were\r\nthe sentiments of Red Jacket at this time.]\r\n\r\nRed Jacket at this time was not far from twenty-six years old. His\r\nforensic abilities had not been called forth, and his influence weighed\r\nbut little in comparison with that of older men. But it may be observed\r\nthat his conduct ever after this, will be found consistent with the\r\nsentiments he entertained, and was free to express. Though young, his\r\nperceptions were keen, he had a deep and penetrating mind and saw at a\r\nglance that in this contest his people were doomed to suffer, to be ground\r\nbetween the upper and nether mill stone.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the summer of 1777, his people received an invitation to join the\r\nforces that were preparing to march under the command of Col. St. Leger\r\nupon Fort Stanwix, being assured that they would not be required to endure\r\nthe fatigues and dangers of the battle, but might \"sit down quietly and\r\nsmoke their pipes, and see the sport;\" Red Jacket endeavored, but in vain,\r\nto prevent his people from going. He said to them, \"_it's a cheat; the\r\ndesign is to deceive you, and if you go you will find that you have been\r\ndeluded_.\"\r\n\r\nThey threw back the taunt,--\"_You are a coward, you have the mind of a\r\nwoman, and are not fit to go to war_.\"\r\n\r\nRed Jacket though not at this time a chief, was a young man of\r\nacknowledged talent and influence, and having a right to express his\r\nopinion, did not hesitate to give it in favor of peace. His opinion was\r\nwell known among his people. Little Beard has frequently been seen to bury\r\nhis face in his blanket, and give vent to his tears, in view of the havoc\r\nmade among the Senecas by the war, at the same time declaring,--\"_Red\r\nJacket was opposed to the war_, HE WAS ALWAYS IN FAVOR OF PEACE, _and how\r\nmuch better it had been, had we listened to his advice_.\" [Footnote:\r\nConversation of the author with Col. Jones.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BARRY ST. LEGER]\r\n\r\nRed Jacket's prediction was too nearly verified. The Senecas suffered most\r\nseverely in that campaign. They fell under the command of Thay-en-dan-e-\r\ngea or Brant, who went with a company of Tories, led by Col. Butler, to\r\nintercept General Herkimer, who was reported as coming to the relief of\r\nthe garrison. At a certain point on the way, where they expected the\r\ngeneral would pass, they formed an ambuscade, and though they selected\r\ntheir ground with wisdom, and acquitted themselves with great bravery,\r\nthey were unable to stand before the invincible courage of the heroes of\r\nOriskany.\r\n\r\nThe Senecas claim to have lost in that engagement thirty-three of their\r\nchiefs, and their feelings in view of it are said to have been sad in the\r\nextreme. [Footnote: \"The mourning was excessive, and was expressed by the\r\nmost doleful yells, shrieks and howlings and by inimitable\r\ngesticulations.\"--Mrs. Jemison's Narrative.]\r\n\r\nThe charge of cowardice applied by the young warriors to Red Jacket, upon\r\ntheir first starting out on this campaign, was one frequently made during\r\nthe war. His views were at different times expressed in opposition to it,\r\nand his arguments as often repelled by the young braves, who could not\r\nendure his invectives. The reply was easily made, and hence in more\r\nfrequent demand, than if it had imposed a greater tax upon their\r\nintellects. The epithet has often been applied to him since, and though\r\nhis tastes did not lead him to seek the fame of a warrior, still it is\r\nbelieved he was not so devoid of courage, as has sometimes been\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\nHis views of the war, were not those of a partisan, hence his conduct was\r\noften censured by those who had entered heartily into the contest.\r\n\r\nBrant has charged him with being the occasion of trouble to him, in his\r\nefforts to arrest the march of Sullivan, and his army, into the Indian\r\ncountry. Particularly at Newtown, where considerable preparations had been\r\nmade for defense. Says Col. Stone,--\"Sa-go-ye-wat-ha was then twenty-nine\r\nyears old, and though it does not appear that he had yet been created a\r\nchief, he nevertheless seems to have been already a man of influence. He\r\nwas in the practice of holding private consultations with the young\r\nwarriors, and some of the younger and less resolute chiefs, for the\r\npurpose of fomenting discontents, and persuading them to sue for what\r\nBrant considered, ignominious terms of peace.\r\n\r\n\"On one occasion as Brant has alleged, Red Jacket had so far succeeded in\r\nhis treachery, as to induce some of the disaffected chiefs to send a\r\nrunner into Sullivan's camp, to make known dissensions he himself had\r\nawakened, and invite a flag of truce, _with propositions of peace to the\r\nIndians_.\"\r\n\r\nThough charged with acting criminally, it is here expressly asserted,\r\n_that it was to obtain peace_. Peace he most earnestly desired for his\r\npeople, who were doomed to be wasted in a contest not their own.\r\n\r\nNor, in view of his feelings respecting the war, is it surprising he\r\nshould have incurred the displeasure of Cornplanter, while endeavoring to\r\nbring his countrymen to make a stand against a portion of the invading\r\narmy, on the beach of Canandaigua lake, where was an Indian village of\r\nsome size. Not finding in Red Jacket an ardor for the undertaking which\r\ncorresponded in any degree with his own, he turned to the young wife of\r\nthe orator and exclaimed,--\"_Leave that man, he is a coward; your children\r\nwill disgrace you, they will all be cowards_.\" [Footnote: Col. Wm. Jones.]\r\n\r\nThe epithet thus applied occasioned uneasiness to none less than to the\r\norator himself. Whenever he chose to notice it, he would make a good\r\nreturn for what he had received.--In a war of words, he was on his own\r\nchosen ground. He was a match for their greatest champion, and in cross-\r\nfiring, it could easily be seen that his missiles were directed by one who\r\nwas perfect master of the art. He could handle at will the most cutting\r\nsarcasm, and while maintaining a good natured, playful mood, deal his\r\nblows with such power and effect, as to make the victim of his irony\r\nresort to some other means of defense, than the tongue. It is said that\r\nfrequently by his cool, good natured railery, he has caused the victim of\r\nhis sport to turn upon and strike him. He would answer it by a hearty\r\nlaugh, unless the blow was of such a nature as to demand of him a\r\ndifferent reception. [Footnote: Wm. Jones, Seneca chief.] He seemed to be\r\narmed at every point, as with a coat of mail, against the arrows of his\r\nassailants. Their most powerful weapons would be turned aside by his\r\npresence of mind, and matchless skill, and leave him apparently unharmed.\r\n\r\nA circumstance illustrating this point, once occurred between him and\r\nLittle Billy, a chief of some note among the Senecas, who was frequently\r\nin the orator's company. This chief, with Red Jacket and one or two\r\nothers, were once passing from their settlement on Canandaigua lake, to\r\nthe old Seneca Castle, near the foot of Seneca lake. On their way they\r\nencountered a large grizzly bear. Little Billy and the others in the\r\ncompany, were frightened and began to run. Red Jacket who was\r\ndistinguished as a hunter, and an excellent marksman, drew up his rifle,\r\nand brought the monster to the ground.\r\n\r\nIt so happened, on one occasion sometime afterward, that Little Billy was\r\nvery pertinacious in calling Red Jacket a coward. The orator did not\r\nappear to notice him at first; but finding that he persisted in the\r\ncharge, he turned to him and coolly and sarcastically said,--\"_Well, if I\r\nam coward I never run unless it's for something bigger than a bear_.\"\r\n[Footnote: Conversation with Seneca chief, Wm. Jones.]\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to add, that nothing more was heard from Little\r\nBilly concerning his cowardice on that day.\r\n\r\nThis charge of cowardice was owing in a great degree to the orator's\r\nposition. He was not on the popular side. The majority of his people were\r\nagainst him. Had he acted in accordance with their wishes, it is a\r\nquestion whether anything would ever have been said about his deficiency\r\nin courage. And this supposition is strengthened by the fact, that at a\r\nsubsequent period in his history, a little display of courage, when acting\r\nin accordance with the wishes of his people, gained for him a marked\r\ndegree of approbation, and gave rise to the affirmation, \"_the stain fixed\r\nupon his character, was thus wiped away by his good conduct in the\r\nfield_.\" [Footnote: McKenney's Indian Biography.]\r\n\r\nIn opposing the wishes of his people, when bent on a war of which he did\r\nnot approve, he gained the epithet of _coward_. With less intelligence,\r\nand less moral courage, he might have seconded the views of his nation,\r\nand been ranked a brave.\r\n\r\nHence, though we do not claim for Red Jacket the possession of qualities,\r\nadapted to make him conspicuous as a military chieftain, we are disposed\r\nto attribute to him the higher courage of acting in accordance with his\r\nown convictions of propriety and duty. \"He was born an orator, and while\r\nmorally brave, lacked the stolid insensibility to suffering and slaughter,\r\nwhich characterized the war-captains of his nation.\" [Footnote: Bryant's\r\naddress.]\r\n\r\nWe readily concede that Red Jacket was fitted by nature to excel in\r\ncouncils of peace, rather than in enterprises of war; to gain victories in\r\na conflict of mind with mind rather than in physical strife, on the field\r\nof battle.\r\n\r\nAnd it may be questioned whether the qualities adapted to the highest\r\nachievements of oratory, would be congenial to the rough encounters of\r\nwar. Especially when the mind is already preoccupied with inward\r\nthirstings after the glory of the rostrum; it will not be apt to sigh for\r\nthe camp, or the noise and tinsel of mere military fame.\r\n\r\nIt is related of him that when a boy, he was present at a great council\r\nheld on the Shenandoah. Many nations were there represented by their wise\r\nmen and orators. The greatest among them was Logan, who had removed from\r\nthe territory of his tribe to Shamokin. He was the son of Shikellemus, a\r\ncelebrated chief of the Cayuga nation, who, before the Revolution was a\r\nwarm friend of the whites.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion referred to, Red Jacket was so charmed with Logan's style,\r\nand manner of delivery, that he resolved to attain if possible the same\r\nhigh standard of eloquence; though he almost despaired of equalling his\r\ndistinguished model.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Cunadesaga, near the Seneca lake, which was at that time\r\nhis home, he sometimes incurred the displeasure and reproof of his mother,\r\nby long absence from her cabin, without any ostensible cause. When hard\r\npressed for an answer, he informed his mother, that \"_he had been playing\r\nLogan_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thus in his mighty soul the fire of a generous emulation had been\r\nkindled, not to go out until his oratorical fame threw a refulgent glory\r\non the declining fortunes of the once formidable Iroquois. In the deep and\r\nsilent forest he practiced elocution, or to use his own expressive\r\nlanguage, _played Logan_, until he caught the manner and tone of his great\r\nmaster. Unconsciously the forest orator, was an imitator of the eloquent\r\nGreek, who tuned his voice on the wild sea beach, to the thunders of the\r\nsurge, and caught from nature's altar his loftiest inspiration.\r\n\r\n\"Not without previous preparation, and the severest discipline, did Red\r\nJacket acquire his power of moving and melting his hearers. His graceful\r\nattitudes, significant gestures, perfect intonation, and impressive\r\npauses, when the lifted finger, and flashing eye told more than utterance,\r\nwere the result of sleepless toil; while his high acquirement was the\r\nproduct of stern habitual thought, study of man, and keen observation.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did not trust to the occasion alone for his finest periods, and\r\nnoblest metaphors. In the armory of his capacious intellect the weapons of\r\nforensic warfare had been previously polished and stored away. Ever ready\r\nfor the unfaltering tongue was the cutting rebuke, or apt illustration. By\r\nlabor, persevering labor, he achieved his renown. By exercising his\r\nfaculties in playing Logan when a boy, one of the highest standards of\r\nmortal eloquence, either in ancient or modern times, he has left a lesson\r\nto all ambitious aspirants, that there is no royal road to greatness; that\r\nthe desired goal is only to be gained by scaling rugged cliffs, and\r\ntreading painful paths.\" [Footnote: This statement, together with the\r\nremarks that follow, is presented almost entire, from a reminiscence of\r\nRed Jacket, given by Mr. Turner in his Pioneer History of the Phelps and\r\nGorham Purchase, a work that has rescued from oblivion, many interesting\r\nand valuable historical recollections.]\r\n\r\nThe habit thus acquired in the orator's youth, became characteristic of\r\nhim, at a later period of his life. Previous to his making any great\r\nforensic effort, he could be seen walking in the woods alone, apparently\r\nin deep study. [Footnote: Col. Wm. Jones.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nEarly struggles--Red Jacket's opportunity for trial--Council at Fort\r\nStanwix--Red Jacket's office of Sachem--Red Jacket's opposition to the\r\nproposed treaty--Excitement created by his speech--Allayed by Cornplanter\r\n--His influence in deciding the treaty--How it affected him.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow long and toilsome the way, ere the ambitious aspirant passes from the\r\nlow grounds of obscurity, to the dazzling heights of fame! How many hours\r\nof anxious toil, through wearisome days and nights, protracted through\r\nmonths and years, are passed, before the arena even is entered, where the\r\nrace commences in earnest! How many struggling emotions between hope and\r\nfear, encouragement and doubt, promise and despair, mark the experience,\r\nand clothe it with the sublimity and interest that belong to action in its\r\nhighest forms!\r\n\r\nDid this child of nature cherishing the bright dream from early life,\r\nnever suffer from these contending emotions, ere he awoke finally to the\r\nconsciousness of the reality, where he could exclaim, I am an orator, yes,\r\nI AM AN ORATOR!\r\n\r\nThis idea Red Jacket began now to cherish. He had practiced in his native\r\nwilds, the forest depths had echoed back those strains of eloquence, that\r\nhad struggled for utterance in his impassioned bosom, and their force\r\nbeing expended here, served but to awaken a still stronger desire to try\r\nhis powers, where he could have the answering sympathy of human hearts.\r\nHis fame and greatness were yet to be achieved. With the inward\r\nconsciousness of strength that would secure for him the eminence he\r\ndesired, he awaited eagerly the opportunity for its exercise. This\r\nopportunity came.\r\n\r\nWhen the storm of war had rolled by, the hour came for deliberation, and\r\ncouncil. England and America had concluded peace, and the jurisdiction of\r\nthe country of the Iroquois had been surrendered to the United States.\r\nStill no provision had been made by the crown for those tribes that had\r\nfreely fought in her defence. They were left to make their own peace, or\r\nprosecute the war on their own account. Their attitude was yet hostile. No\r\nexpedition of importance was undertaken, but the border men were\r\nconstantly annoyed by Indians, who drove away their horses and cattle, and\r\ncommitted other acts of depredation. And the inhabitants of the frontier\r\nhad suffered so severely from the Indian tribes during the war, that these\r\nacts served to awaken still deeper feelings of hostility toward them, and\r\nled some openly to recommend that the Indians be driven from their lands,\r\nand that these be forfeited to the State.\r\n\r\nThese councils were strenuously resisted by the general government. The\r\nhumane and considerate Washington thought it wiser to try and conciliate\r\nthem, and if possible win their confidence and esteem, claiming that their\r\nlands, when needed, could be obtained at a cheaper rate by negotiation and\r\npurchase, than by war and conquest.\r\n\r\nThis course, the excellence of which experience has fully demonstrated,\r\nwas finally adopted, and in pursuance of this design, a general council of\r\nthe Iroquois was convened at Fort Stanwix, in the fall of 1784. It was\r\nattended by Oliver Wolcott, Richard Butler, and Arthur Lee, who were\r\nappointed commissioners on the part of the United States. The different\r\ntribes of the Iroquois were represented, and Red Jacket was present, and\r\ntook an active part in its deliberations. He had now been elected to the\r\noffice of Sachem; at what time precisely, is not known, but probably not\r\nfar from the close of the war of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which he gained this office has been ascribed by some to\r\nartifice as well as the force of his eloquence. Col. Stone says, that\r\n\"aspiring to the rank of chief, he not only wrought upon the minds of his\r\npeople, by the exertion of that faculty which was ever with them a high\r\nstandard of merit, but he succeeded in availing himself of the\r\nsuperstitious constitution of his race, to effect his purpose. His first\r\nessay was to dream that he was, or should be a chief, and that the Great\r\nSpirit was angry that his nation had not advanced him to that dignity.\r\nThis dream, with the necessary variations, he repeated until, fortunately\r\nfor him, the small pox broke out among the Senecas. He then proclaimed the\r\nloathsome infliction a judgment sent by the Great Spirit, to punish them\r\nfor their ingratitude to him. The consequence ultimately was, that by\r\nadministering flattery to some, working upon the superstitious fears of\r\nothers, and by awakening the admiration of all by his eloquence, he\r\nreached the goal of his ambition.\" [Footnote: Col. Stone's Life and Times\r\nof Thayendanegea and Life and Times of Red Jacket. This statement has been\r\ndenied by some, who affirm that his eloquence was the sole cause of his\r\nelevation. If this representation came from Brant, it may be recollected\r\nthat between Red Jacket and Brant there did not exist a very strong\r\nattachment, and statements made by one concerning the other, would not be\r\nlikely to bear the coloring of a very warm friendship.]\r\n\r\nHowever this may have been, it is certain this course was not necessary to\r\nestablish Red Jacket's position among his people. The circumstances of\r\ntheir history created a necessity for his transcendent abilities, and the\r\nlight of his genius, though it may have been obscured for a time, must\r\neventually have shone forth, in its original beauty and splendor.\r\n\r\nRed Jacket was now called upon to assist in the deliberations of his\r\npeople, and from this time to the day of his death, we find him connected\r\nwith, and bearing an important part in all of their public transactions.\r\n\r\nThe council at Fort Stanwix was the first occasion in which he appeared\r\nbefore the public. It was a meeting of no small moment. With an anxious\r\nheart the Indian left his home and wended his way, through his native\r\nforests, to the place where he was to meet in council, the chiefs of the\r\nthirteen fires. His own tribes had been wasted, by a long and bloody war.\r\nThe nation they had so long clung to, and by whose artifice they had been\r\nled to engage in the strife, stood confessedly vanquished. A new power had\r\narisen in the land, what bearing would it have on their future fortunes?\r\n\r\nWith the importance of this gathering none were more deeply impressed than\r\nRed Jacket.--Yonder he stands, alone;--his knit brow, and searching glance\r\nindicate a process of thought, which stirs deeply the emotions of the\r\ninner man.--Tread lightly, lest you disturb the silent evolutions of that\r\nairy battalion, that is wheeling into rank and file, thoughts that\r\ndischarged in words, reach the mark and do execution.--Now he wears a look\r\nof indignation, which presently turns to one of proud defiance, as he\r\ncontemplates the encroaching disposition of the white race.--Now you may\r\ndetect an air of scorn, and his eye flashes fire, as he regards them at\r\nfirst a feeble colony, which might easily have been crushed by the strong\r\narm of the Iroquois.--A feeling of deep concern directly overspreads his\r\nfeatures, as he thinks of their advancing power, and of the prospect of\r\ntheir surpassing even the glory of his own ancestry.--A still deeper shade\r\nsteals over him as he thinks of the waning fortunes of his people.--\r\nPresently his countenance is lighted up;--his feelings are all aglow,--a\r\nbright thought, has entered his mind.--He conceives the idea of the union\r\nof the entire race of red men, to resist the encroachments of the whites.\r\n--Are they not yet strong? And united, would they not yet be, a\r\nformidable power?\r\n\r\nWith anxious and matured thoughts, Red Jacket comes to this council\r\ngathering. Its bearing on his nation and race, he deeply scans, and\r\ntreasures up those burning thoughts, with which he is to electrify, and\r\nset on fire the bosoms of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nOf the proceedings of this council, little is known aside from the bare\r\ntreaty itself. By this treaty perpetual peace and amity were agreed upon\r\nbetween the United States, and the Iroquois, and the latter ceded to the\r\nUnited States, all their lands lying west of a line commencing at the\r\nmouth of a creek four miles east of Niagara, at a place on Lake Ontario\r\ncalled Johnson's Landing; thence south, in a direction always four miles\r\neast of the portage, or carrying-path, between Lakes Erie and Ontario, to\r\nthe mouth of Buffalo creek, on Lake Erie; thence due south to the north\r\nboundary of the state of Pennsylvania; thence west to the end of said\r\nboundary; thence south along the west boundary of the state of\r\nPennsylvania to the Ohio river.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of this surrender to the United States of their claim to\r\nwestern lands, the Iroquois were to be secure in the peaceful possession\r\nof the lands they inhabited in the state of New York.\r\n\r\nThis treaty Red Jacket strenuously resisted. He regarded the proposed\r\ncession of lands as exorbitant and unjust, and summoned all the resources\r\nof his eloquence to defend his position. The course of his argument and\r\nthe various means he took to enforce it, we have no means of adequately\r\npresenting. A few hints respecting it, and the testimony of those present\r\nas to the effect produced, is all we have to guide us in forming any\r\nestimate of its merits.\r\n\r\nAfter giving a vivid representation of the encroachments already made upon\r\nthem by the whites, and of the advances they were making in numbers and\r\npower, as well as extent of territory, he reminded his hearers of the\r\nancient glory of the Iroquois, and contrasted it with their present wasted\r\nand feeble condition. They had been passing through a mighty convulsion,\r\nthe hurricane had swept over their dwellings, their homes were laid waste,\r\ntheir country made desolate.\r\n\r\nHe directed them to the extensive dominion they had exercised. Their\r\nempire was wide, on the north, and east, and south, and west, there were\r\nnone to stay their hand, or limit their power. A broad continent was open\r\nto them on every side, and their seats were large. But now they were met\r\nby a people to whom they had surrendered a large portion of their lands,\r\nand \"they are driving us on toward the setting sun. They would shut us in,\r\nthey would close up the path to our brethren at the west. We demand an\r\nopen way.\"\r\n\r\nThey had no right, he affirmed, to part with their western lands. Their\r\nlaws, their ancient usages forbade it. They ought never to decide a\r\nquestion so momentous as this, without giving all the parties a hearing,\r\nwho have any interest in its decision. They should be present and join in\r\ntheir deliberations. Their brethren at the west had a right to be\r\nconsulted in this matter.--It would be unworthy of the name, and exalted\r\nfame of the Iroquois, to decide the question without reference to them.--\r\nIt was a question that affected deeply the interests of the entire race of\r\nred men on this continent. He declared finally that rather than yield to\r\nthe exorbitant demands of the treaty, they should take up their arms, and\r\nprosecute the war on their own account.\r\n\r\nSuch is the scanty outline of a speech that made a wonderful impression on\r\nthe minds of all his people who were present. During the progress of his\r\nspeech, their emotions were wrought up to a pitch, that seemed to betoken\r\na rising storm, and at times it seemed as though it needed but a spark to\r\nset on fire a flame that was ready to burst out with consuming force.\r\n\r\nThose present, who did not understand the language of the orator, were\r\ndeeply interested in his voice, his manner of elocution, and his perfect\r\nand inimitable action. They caught fire from his eye, and felt the\r\ninspiration, which was kindled in the minds of all who listened to him\r\nunderstandingly. When he sat down his work was accomplished. There was but\r\none heart among his people. From this time on, he was the peerless orator\r\nof his nation.\r\n\r\nA very interesting sketch of Red Jacket as an orator, refers, for the\r\nexistence of the facts which form the basis of its statements, to a treaty\r\nheld at Canandaigua in 1794. It has been copied by Drake, and published in\r\nalmost every sketch of the orator's life. Mr. Stone questions its\r\ntruthfulness on the ground that there is no notice of it in any notes of\r\nthis council taken at the time, and because also there was evidently an\r\nabsence of the peculiar circumstances, which the speech referred to, seems\r\nto demand. Still he introduces it under the supposition that if delivered\r\nthere at all, it might have been during the excitement produced among the\r\nIndians, by the rejection from the council, by Col. Pickering, of one\r\nJohnson, a messenger from Brant, who had been invited to be present at\r\nthat council. Yet this is by no means probable, as Red Jacket would have\r\nbeen far from rising into eloquence on an occasion, which from his known\r\nrelations to the proud Mohawk, he would naturally view with satisfaction,\r\ninstead of resentment. The more probable supposition is, that the writer\r\ncaught up this as a traditionary statement, which, owing to the lapse of\r\ntime and the uncertainty of memory, had been changed in one or two of its\r\nitems, and receiving it as correct, penned it in good faith, as having\r\ntranspired at that treaty. It is a correct presentation of some of the\r\npoints in the orator's speech on this occasion, and is as follows:\r\n[Footnote: Mr. Stone justly supposes this speech might have been made at\r\nthe treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1784.]\r\n\r\n\"... The witnesses of the scene will never forget the powers of native\r\noratory. Two days had passed away in negotiation with the Indians for a\r\ncession of their lands. The contract was supposed to be nearly completed,\r\nwhen Red Jacket arose. With the grace and dignity of a Roman Senator, he\r\ndrew his blanket around him, and with a piercing eye surveyed the\r\nmultitude. All was hushed. Nothing interposed to break the silence, but\r\nthe rustling of the leaves. After a long and solemn, but not unmeaning\r\npause, he commenced in a low voice, and sententious style. Rising\r\ngradually with the subject, he depicted the primitive simplicity and\r\nhappiness of his nation, and the wrongs they had sustained from the\r\nusurpations of white men, with such a bold and faithful pencil, that every\r\nauditor was soon roused to vengeance, or melted to tears. The effect was\r\ninexpressible. But ere the emotions of admiration and sympathy had\r\nsubsided, the white men became alarmed. They were in the heart of an\r\nIndian country, surrounded by ten times their number, who were inflamed by\r\na remembrance of their injuries, and excited to indignation by the\r\neloquence of a favorite chief. Appalled and terrified, the white men cast\r\na cheerless gaze on the hordes around them. A nod from the chiefs might be\r\nthe onset of destruction. At this portentious moment, Farmer's Brother\r\ninterposed. He replied not to his brother chief, but with a sagacity truly\r\naboriginal, he caused the cessation of the council, introduced good cheer,\r\ncommended the eloquence of Red Jacket, and before the meeting had\r\nreassembled, with the aid of other prudent chiefs, he had moderated the\r\nfury of his nation to a more salutary view of the question before them.\"\r\n\r\nThe commissioners replied, but without making much headway on account of\r\nthe agitation and excitement, produced by the orator's speech; that by the\r\ncommon usages of war they might lay claim to a much larger extent of\r\nterritory; that their demand was characterized by great moderation, and\r\ninsisted on their yielding to the terms proposed.\r\n\r\nThere was little disposition among them to yield the point, yet the treaty\r\nwas finally brought to a successful issue, by the influence of\r\nCornplanter.\r\n\r\nCornplanter was a noble specimen of the Indian race. He had all the\r\nsagacity for which his people were distinguished, and was equally active,\r\neloquent and brave. He was well qualified by his talents to engage in the\r\nlegislative councils of his nation, and was unsurpassed by any, for\r\nprowess and daring in the bloody field of strife. No chief, Thayendanegea\r\nnot excepted, had gained higher laurels for personal valor, and none\r\ncommanded more fully the confidence and esteem of his nation. His people\r\nlooked up to him as a tower of strength, and when he spake, his words fell\r\nupon them with the weight of great authority. Better acquainted than his\r\njunior associate with the details of war, and understanding likewise the\r\nwasted and feeble condition of his people, and having learned in the late\r\nconflict something of the power of the enemy they would have to encounter,\r\nhe regarded the idea of their resistance as wholly impracticable, and\r\nadvised a compliance with the terms of the treaty. Though he regretted the\r\nloss of any more territory, he wisely concluded it was better to lose a\r\npart, than to be deprived of all. And by throwing his influence decidedly\r\nin favor, he succeeded finally in quieting the minds of his people, and in\r\npersuading them to accede to the proposals made.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of regret that so few traces are left, of Red Jacket's\r\nspeech on this occasion. Yet had his speech been reported, we might have\r\nbeen as much at a loss as at present, to derive from it a just estimation\r\nof his talents. His speeches as reported are tame when compared with the\r\neffect produced.\r\n\r\nThe Indian was an unwritten language. The most distinguished orators of\r\nthe Iroquois confederacy, matured their thoughts in solitude without the\r\naid of the pen, and when uttered in the hearing of the people, they passed\r\nforever into oblivion, only as a striking passage may hare been retained\r\nin memory. And with them the want of a written language was thus in a\r\nmeasure compensated. They made an increased effort to treasure up their\r\nthoughts. Yet how much must necessarily have been lost! and how liable to\r\nwaste away, that which remained.\r\n\r\nTrusting to them how imperfect must have been a reported speech! And\r\nrelying on those who transferred their speeches to a different language,\r\nwe have little assurance of any thing better than mutilated transcripts of\r\nthe original. Need we be surprised then, to find in Red Jacket's published\r\nspeeches, a tameness unworthy of his fame? Red Jacket was esteemed by the\r\nmen of his time as an orator, surpassingly eloquent.\r\n\r\nIn his speeches as reported, this does not appear. Hence, his reported\r\nspeeches fail to do him justice, or the men of his time very much\r\noverrated his talents.\r\n\r\nTaking the latter horn of the dilemma we impeach the judgment and good\r\nsense of those who have gone before us. Assuming the former, we present an\r\nadmitted and proclaimed fact. His contemporaries, while they conceded to\r\nhim the highest attributes and accomplishments of eloquence, unite in\r\naffirming that his reported speeches come far short of the original.\r\n\r\n_Captain Horatio Jones_, a favorite interpreter, has frequently\r\ndeclared,--\"_it is impossible to do Red Jacket justice_.\" The peculiar\r\nshade given to the idea, its beauty in its own native idiom, was often\r\nentirely lost in the transfer. In much the same way, Captain Jasper\r\nParrish, of Canandaigua, has frequently been heard to speak, when\r\nreferring to the forensic efforts of the orator.\r\n\r\nAnd besides, those passages that were most deeply fraught with eloquence,\r\nwere often lost entirely, from the fact that the way having been prepared\r\nby a recital of those details that are reported, the reporter himself has\r\nbeen carried away by the very flood that surrounded, uplifted, and carried\r\naway the mass of those who heard him speak. So that the only note that\r\nwould be made, of a passage of considerable length, is given in one or two\r\nshort sentences. [Footnote: Conversation of the author with Col. Wm.\r\nJones.]\r\n\r\nBy the generality of the Iroquois, the terms of the treaty at Fort Stanwix\r\nwere regarded as severe; and though the services of the renowned\r\nCornplanter were engaged by the commissioners, in an effort to persuade\r\nthe disaffected into a reconciliation with it, the attempt was but\r\npartially successful, and was made at the expense of his own high standing\r\namong his people. They were not easily reconciled, and were so much\r\ndispleased with his conduct on this, and one or two subsequent occasions,\r\nthat they even threatened his life. A circumstance he touchingly refers to\r\nin a speech addressed to General Washington.\r\n\r\n\"Father,\" said he, \"we will not conceal from you that the great God and\r\nnot man, has preserved Cornplanter, from the hands of his own nation. For\r\nthey ask continually--where is the land which our children, and their\r\nchildren after them are to lie down upon? When the Sun goes down he opens\r\nhis heart before God, and earlier than the sun appears upon the hills, he\r\ngives thanks for his protection during the night; for he feels that among\r\nmen become desperate by their danger, it is God only that can preserve\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nClaim of the United States to Indian lands--Conflicting claims of\r\ndifferent States--Difficulty settled--Attempt to acquire the land by a\r\nlease--Purchase by Phelps and Gorham--Further purchase by Robert Morris.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of the war of the Revolution, the territory ceded by Great\r\nBritain to the United States, included large tracts of country occupied by\r\nthe Indians. In ceding these lands, she ceded only the right claimed by\r\nherself, on the ground of original discovery, which was simply a priority\r\nof right to purchase of the original occupants of the soil. The Indians\r\nwere allowed to dwell upon these lands, and were considered in a certain\r\nsense the owners, but were required in case of a sale, to dispose of them\r\nto the government. [Footnote: Kent's Commentary.]\r\n\r\nAs each State claimed to be sovereign in every interest not ceded to the\r\ngeneral government, each State claimed the territory covered by its\r\noriginal charter. These charters, owing to great ignorance of geographical\r\nlimits, created claims that conflicted with each other. From this source\r\noriginated difficult questions about land titles and jurisdiction, between\r\nthe States of Connecticut and Pennsylvania,--Massachusetts and New York.\r\nThese difficulties which existed before, the greater question of the\r\nRevolutionary war suspended for a time, but when peace was concluded, they\r\ncame up again for a consideration and settlement.\r\n\r\nThe way was in a measure prepared for this, by the relinquishment to the\r\ngeneral government, on the part of New York in 1781, and of Massachusetts\r\nin 1785, of all their right to territory west of a meridian line drawn\r\nsouth, from the western end of Lake Ontario.\r\n\r\nIn the adjustment of these difficulties, Connecticut relinquished her\r\nclaim to a tract of land on the Susquehanna in Pennsylvania, called the\r\nGore, and acquired that part of the State of Ohio called New Connecticut,\r\nor Western Reserve. And Pennsylvania obtained a tract of land lying\r\nimmediately beyond the western boundary of the State of New York, and\r\nnorth-east of her own, embracing the harbor of Presque Isle, on Lake Erie,\r\nfamiliarly known as the Triangle, thus giving her access to the waters of\r\nthis Lake.\r\n\r\nThe question in controversy between the States of New York and\r\nMassachusetts was more serious, owing to the large amount of territory\r\nclaimed by the latter in western New York. It was brought to an amicable\r\nsettlement, by Massachusetts surrendering to New York the right of\r\njurisdiction, over all the land west of the present eastern boundary of\r\nthe State; and by New York giving to Massachusetts the pre-emptive right,\r\nor right of purchasing of the Indians, all of the lands lying west of a\r\nmeridian line drawn through Seneca Lake, from a certain point on the\r\nnorthern boundary of Pennsylvania, reserving however, a strip of land one\r\nmile in width, along the eastern shore of the Niagara river. Thus New\r\nYork, while she retained the sovereignty, lost the fee of about six\r\nmillions of acres of land, in one of the finest regions of country in the\r\nnew world. [Footnote: For a more full account, see \"Turner's History of\r\nthe Phelps and Gorham Purchase.\"]\r\n\r\nWhile these difficulties were being adjusted, a magnificent speculation\r\nwas in progress, which bid fair to meet the expectations of its earnest\r\nprojectors. A company was organized, called the New York and Genesee Land\r\nCompany, with a view to obtain the entire tract of Indian lands within the\r\nState. To evade the law forbidding the sale of these lands to any party\r\nnot authorized by the State, it was proposed to obtain them by a lease,\r\nthat should extend nine hundred and ninety-nine years. A lease extending\r\nso long, was regarded as equivalent to a sale.\r\n\r\nWith a view to further its designs another company, the Niagara Genesee\r\nCompany, was also formed in Canada, of those who were most in\r\ncorrespondence with the Indians, and who would be influential in securing\r\nfrom them a decision in favor of their object.\r\n\r\nThese organizations, especially the New York Land Company, were large, and\r\nincluded men of wealth and prominence, both in New York and Canada. With\r\nsuch appliances as they were enabled to bring to bear upon the Indians,\r\nthey secured, in November, 1787, a _lease for nine hundred and ninety-\r\nnine years_, of all the lands of the Iroquois in the State of New York,\r\nexcept some small reservations, and the privilege of hunting and fishing,\r\nfor an annual rent of two thousand dollars, and a promised gift of twenty\r\nthousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThe formidable character of these associations created a just alarm, and\r\nmeasures were immediately undertaken to circumvent their influence. An act\r\nwas passed by the Legislature of New York, in March, 1788, authorizing the\r\ngovernor to disregard all contracts made with the Indians, and not\r\nsanctioned by the State; and to cause those who had entered upon Indian\r\nlands under such contracts, to be driven off, and their houses destroyed.\r\nThe sheriff of the county was directed to dispossess intruders and burn\r\ntheir dwellings, and a military force was called out, that strictly\r\nenforced these orders.\r\n\r\nThus by the energetic action of Governor Clinton of New York, the designs\r\nof these organizations were overruled.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1784, the Legislature of New York had passed an act,\r\nappointing the governor, and a Board of Commissioners, the Superintendents\r\nof Indian affairs, and as there were other Indian lands within the State,\r\nnot covered by the pre-emptive right of Massachusetts, these commissioners\r\nwith the governor at their head, entered upon negotiations with a view of\r\npurchasing them, and securing a title to them for the State. [Footnote:\r\nThe commissioners designated were: Abraham Cuyler, Peter Schuyler and\r\nHenry Glen, who associated with them Philip Schuyler, Robert Yates,\r\nAbraham Ten Broeck, A. Yates, Jr., P. W. Yates, John J. Beekman, Mathew\r\nVischer, and Gen. Gansevoort.]\r\n\r\nA council of the Iroquois was appointed for this purpose, at Fort\r\nSchuyler, on the first of September, 1788.\r\n\r\nThe Leasees disappointed and angered by the bold and decisive measures\r\ntaken against them, exerted their influence to prevent the Indians from\r\nassembling. But by measures equally energetic in its favor, a\r\nrepresentation of the different tribes was obtained, and a treaty was\r\nconcluded on the 12th, in which was conveyed to the State the land of the\r\nOnondagas; some reservations excepted, in consideration of one thousand\r\ndollars, in hand paid and an annuity of five hundred dollars forever.\r\n\r\nThen followed negotiations with the Oneidas. Speeches were interchanged,\r\npropositions made and rejected, until finally an agreement was made, and a\r\ndeed of cession executed by the chiefs, conveying all their lands,\r\nexcepting certain reservations, in consideration of two thousand dollars\r\nin money, two thousand dollars in clothing and other goods, one thousand\r\ndollars in provisions, five hundred dollars for the erection of a saw and\r\ngrist mill on their reservation, and an annuity of six hundred dollars\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners next appointed a council to be held at Albany, December\r\n15, 1788. Great difficulty was experienced in getting the Indians\r\ntogether, the Leasees it is said, \"kept the Indians so continually\r\nintoxicated, it was impossible to do anything with them.\" [Footnote:\r\nTurner's History.]\r\n\r\nIt was not until the eleventh of the February following, that a sufficient\r\nnumber were brought together, to proceed with the negotiations; and on the\r\ntwenty-fifth, the preliminaries having been settled, the Cayugas ceded to\r\nthe State all of their lands, excepting a large reservation of one hundred\r\nsquare miles. It was in consideration of five hundred dollars in hand,\r\nsixteen hundred and twenty-eight dollars in June following, and an annuity\r\nof five hundred dollars forever.\r\n\r\nMr. Turner in alluding to these negotiations very properly observes, \"it\r\nwas only after a hard struggle of much perplexity and embarrassment, that\r\nthe object was accomplished. For the honor of our country, it could be\r\nwished that all Indian negotiations and treaties, had been attended with\r\nas little wrong, had been conducted as fairly as were those under the\r\nauspices and general direction of George Clinton. No where has the veteran\r\nwarrior and statesman left a better proof of his sterling integrity and\r\nability, than is furnished by the records of these treaties. In no case\r\ndid he allow the Indians to be deceived, but stated to them from time to\r\ntime, with unwearied patience, the true conditions of the bargains they\r\nwere consummating.\"\r\n\r\nHe says further, \"the treaties for lands found the Six Nations in a\r\nmiserable condition. They had warred on the side of a losing party; for\r\nlong years the field and the chase had been neglected; they were suffering\r\nfor food and raiment. Half-famished they flocked to the treaties and were\r\nfed and clothed. One item of expense charged in the accounts of the treaty\r\nat Albany in 1789, was for horses paid for, that the Indians had killed\r\nand eaten on their way down. For several years in addition to the amount\r\nof provisions distributed to them at the treaties, boatloads of corn were\r\ndistributed among them by the State.\"\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that Red Jacket, Cornplanter, Brant, or other of the\r\nmore noted chiefs among the Iroquois, were present to take a part in these\r\nnegotiations. Hence exception was taken to these proceedings. When the\r\ntime drew near for paying the first annuity, the Onondagas sent an agent\r\nto Governor Clinton, saying they had received four strings of wampum from\r\nthe Senecas, forbidding them to go to Fort Stanwix to receive the money,\r\nand declaring also \"that the governor of Quebec wanted their lands; that\r\nSir John wanted them; Col. Butler wants the Cayugas' lands; and the\r\ncommanding officer of Fort Niagara wants the Senecas' lands.\"\r\n\r\nThey were assured in reply that they might \"make their minds easy,\" the\r\ngovernor would protect them; that the Leasees were the cause of their\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nThe Cayugas also sent a message to the governor, saying they were\r\n\"threatened with destruction, even total extermination. The voice comes\r\nfrom the west; _its sound is terrible, our brothers the Cayugas and\r\nOnondagas are to share the same fate_.\"\r\n\r\nThe complaint was, they had sold their lands without consulting the\r\n_western tribes_.\r\n\r\nThe decided position of the Executive in giving them assurance of\r\nprotection, was the means of dissipating their alarm.\r\n\r\nHistorical evidence renders it apparent, that at this early period, the\r\ndesign was entertained by those in Canada, whose control over the Indians\r\nwas well nigh supreme, to gain through them possession of Western New\r\nYork, and without compromising the government of Great Britain, sever it\r\nfrom the United States, connect it with the territory of the North-west,\r\nand hold it by Indian possession, in a sort of quasi allegiance, to the\r\ncrown of England.\r\n\r\nTheir design with respect to Western New York was defeated by the\r\nenergetic measures of its chief executive, but further on we will see they\r\ndid not relinquish the idea of holding from the United States, the\r\nterritory of the North-west.\r\n\r\nNext in the race of competition for the broad and fertile lands of the\r\nGenesee, appear the names of Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham. They were\r\nthe acknowledged representatives of a considerable body of men, who were\r\nambitious of securing an interest in what was regarded as the most\r\ndesirable region in this country.\r\n\r\nFrom the advent of Gen. Sullivan's army into the Indian country in 1779,\r\ntheir route being through the very finest portion of Western New York, and\r\nat a season of the year when vegetation was in its highest perfection; the\r\nbeauty and fertility of these lands became the theme of praise, on the\r\npart of every soldier that beheld them. Their fame was thus carried to\r\nalmost every village and hamlet in Pennsylvania and New England. Hence\r\ngreat eagerness was manifested in regard to the title, and settlement of\r\nthese lands.\r\n\r\nThe company of which Messrs. Phelps and Gorham were the leading spirits,\r\nhaving purchased the pre-emptive right of Massachusetts, in the spring of\r\n1788, Mr. Phelps went on to the ground, and was successful in convening a\r\ncouncil of the Indians for the sale of their lands, at Buffalo creek,\r\nduring the month of July of the same year. [Footnote: His success in\r\nobtaining this council, and securing a sale, was owing in a large degree,\r\nto his policy in paying court to the powerful faction of the Leasees\r\nresiding in Canada, and giving them an interest in the purchase.]\r\n\r\nThe Indians at this treaty strenuously resisted the sale of any of their\r\nland west of the Genesee river; yet with a view of furnishing \"_a piece\r\nof ground for a mill yard_\" at the Genesee Falls, were finally persuaded\r\nto give their assent to a boundary line, that included a tract twelve\r\nmiles square, west of that river. The eastern boundary of the lands sold,\r\nwas the Massachusetts pre-emptive line; the western, was a line \"beginning\r\nin the northern line of Pennsylvania, due south of the corner or point of\r\nland made by the confluence of the Genesee river, and the Canaseraga\r\ncreek, thence north on said meridian line to the corner or point, at the\r\nconfluence aforesaid; thence northwardly along the waters of the Genesee\r\nriver, to a point two miles north of Canawangus village, thence running\r\ndue west 12 miles; thence running northwardly so as to be twelve miles\r\ndistant from the western bounds of said river, to the shores of Lake\r\nOntario.\" The lands thus ceded, are what has been called \"_The Phelps and\r\nGorham Purchase_.\" It contained by estimation two million and six hundred\r\nthousand acres, for which they agreed to pay the Indians five thousand\r\ndollars, and an annuity of five hundred dollars forever.\r\n\r\nRobert Morris, the distinguished financier of the Revolution, afterward\r\nbecame owner of the greater part of this purchase, as well as of the pre-\r\nemptive right of Massachusetts to the remaining part of Western New York.\r\nThrough his agent in London, Wm. Temple Franklin, grandson of Doctor\r\nFranklin, these lands were again sold to an association of gentlemen,\r\nconsisting of Sir William Pultney, John Hornby, and Patrick Colquhoun, and\r\nthe farther settlement of this region, auspiciously commenced under its\r\noriginal proprietors, was conducted principally under their\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nAn intelligent and enterprising young Scotchman, Charles Williamson, who\r\nhad previously devoted his time while detained as a prisoner in this\r\ncountry, during the war of the Revolution, to investigations respecting\r\nits geographical resources and limits, and who from his disposition and\r\nbusiness capacity, was well qualified for the station, was appointed their\r\nagent, and emigrating hither with his family, and two other young\r\nScotchmen as his assistants, John Johnstone, and Charles Cameron, he\r\nbecame identified with the early history and progress of the extensive and\r\nimportant part of the Indian territory, that as we have seen, had just\r\nbeen opened, and was inviting a new race, to take possession of its virgin\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nUnion of the Western Indian Tribes contemplated--Hostile influence of the\r\nagents of Great Britain in Canada--Ambitious project of Thayendanegea or\r\nBrant--Council at Tioga Point--Indian Ceremonies--Visit of Cornplanter and\r\nothers at the seat of government--Kindly feeling of Washington--Fresh\r\noccasion of trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Red Jacket, at the treaty of Fort Stanwix, in 1784, projected the\r\nbold idea of the union of all the Indian tribes on the continent, to\r\nresist the aggressions of the whites, he may not have thought it would\r\nsoon come near having a practical fulfillment. This thought grew out of\r\nthe circumstances and necessities of the times, and was the natural\r\nforecast of a great mind. His words sank deep into the hearts of his\r\npeople,--they were carried beyond the bounds of that council-fire,--they\r\nwent gliding along with the light canoe that plied the Lakes,--and were\r\nwafted onward by the waters of the Ohio and Mississippi. Several causes\r\ncontributed to give direction and force to this movement.\r\n\r\nProminent among them was the fact, that the treaty of peace with Great\r\nBritain in 1783, though it put an end to the war, did not secure friendly\r\nrelations between the two countries. Hostile feelings had been engendered\r\nand were still cherished, particularly by those who had taken refuge in\r\nCanada, in the early part of the Revolutionary struggle. Some of them were\r\nvery active in stirring up Indian hostilities among the tribes at the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nBut prominent above all others were the exertions of Thayendanegea, or\r\nBrant, the famous war-chief, from whose leadership the inhabitants of our\r\nfrontier settlements had suffered so severely, during the war of the\r\nRevolution. Very soon after the treaty at Fort Stanwix in 1784, from the\r\ndissatisfaction growing out of that treaty, and other indications among\r\nthe Indians, he began to entertain the ambitious project of forming a\r\ngrand Indian confederacy, of which he would be chief, embracing not only\r\nthe Iroquois, but all of the Indian nations of the great North-west. He\r\nhad given the entire summer of 1785, to the business of visiting these\r\nnations, and holding councils among them, with a view to the furtherance\r\nof this object. [Footnote: See Stone's Life and Times of Brant, Vol. 2, p.\r\n248.]\r\n\r\nHe visited England at the close of this year, \"ostensibly for the purpose\r\nof adjusting the claims of the loyal Mohawks upon the crown, for\r\nindemnification of their losses and sacrifices in the contest, from which\r\nthey had recently emerged.\" [Footnote: See Stone's Life and Times of\r\nBrant, Vol. 2, p. 248.]\r\n\r\n... \"Coupled with the special business of the Indian claims, was the\r\ndesign of _sounding the British government, touching the degree of\r\ncountenance or the amount of assistance which he might expect from that\r\nquarter, in the event of a general Indian war against the United\r\nStates_.\" [Footnote: Ibid.]\r\n\r\nHis arrival at Salisbury was thus noted in a letter from that place, dated\r\nDecember 12, 1785, and published in London. \"Monday last, Colonel Joseph\r\nBrant, the celebrated King of the Mohawks, arrived in this city from\r\nAmerica, and after dining with Colonel De Peister, at the head-quarters\r\nhere, proceeded on his journey to London. This extraordinary personage is\r\nsaid to have presided at the late Grand Congress of Confederate chiefs, of\r\nthe Indian nations in America, and to be by them appointed to the conduct\r\nand chief command in the war, _which they now meditate against the United\r\nStates of America_. He took his departure for England immediately as\r\nthat assembly broke up; and it is conjectured that his embassy to the\r\nBritish Court is of great importance.\" [Footnote: Life of Brant, Vol. 2,\r\np. 249.]\r\n\r\nNo public, decisive answer, for obvious reasons, was given to this\r\napplication for countenance and aid in the contemplated war, for this part\r\nof the errand of the Mohawk chief, was \"_unknown to the public at that\r\nday_.\" [Footnote: Life of Brant, Vol. 2, p. 249.]\r\n\r\nCaptain Brant on his return to America in 1786, entered once more upon the\r\nwork of combining the Indian forces, and assembled a grand confederate\r\ncouncil, which was held at Huron village, near the mouth of Detroit River.\r\n[Footnote: It was attended by the Six Nations, the Hurons, Ottawas,\r\nMiamis, Shawanese, Chippewas, Cherokees, Delawares, Pottowattamies, and\r\nWabash, confederates.]\r\n\r\nAn address to the Congress of the United States was agreed upon at this\r\ncouncil, pacific in its tone, provided no encroachments were made upon\r\ntheir lands west of the Ohio river. This was their ultimatum previous to\r\nthe war, in which they were afterwards united.\r\n\r\nAt the treaty of peace between Great Britain and the United States in\r\n1783, it was stipulated that the military posts south of the great lakes\r\nshould be surrendered. This surrender was refused, on the plea that the\r\nUnited States had not fulfilled an agreement on her part, to see the just\r\nclaims, due the subjects of Great Britain, cancelled.\r\n\r\nFrom certain correspondence at this time it appears that there were other\r\nreasons also, for the witholding of these forts. Their surrender was\r\nearnestly desired on the part of the United States, as it was well\r\nunderstood, they gave encouragement to the hostile combinations, that at\r\nthis time were going on.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Captain Brant by Sir John Johnson dated Quebec, March 22d,\r\n1787, he says, \"Do not suffer an idea to hold a place in your mind, that\r\nit will be for your interest to sit still and see the Americans attempt\r\nthe posts. [Footnote: Oswegatchie, Oswego, Niagara, Detroit and Mackinaw.]\r\n_It is for your sakes chiefly, if not entirely, that we hold them._ If\r\nyou become indifferent about them, they may perhaps be given up; what\r\nsecurity would you then have? You would be at the mercy of a people whose\r\nblood calls aloud for revenge; whereas, by supporting them, you encourage\r\nus to hold them, and encourage new settlements, already considerable, and\r\nevery day increasing by numbers coming in, who find they can't live in the\r\nStates. Many thousands are preparing to come in. This increase of his\r\nMajesty's subjects will serve as a protection to you, should the subjects\r\nof the States, by endeavoring to make further encroachments on you,\r\ndisturb your quiet.\" [Footnote: Stone's Life and Times of Brant.]\r\n\r\nAnother letter soon after, by Major Mathews seems to confirm the above\r\nstatements. \"His Lordship [Footnote: Lord Dorchester, Governor General of\r\nCanada, formerly Sir Guy Carlton.] wishes them (the Indians), to act as is\r\nbest for their interest; he cannot begin a war with the Americans, because\r\nsome of their people encroach and make depredations upon parts of the\r\nIndian country; but they must see it is his Lordship's _intention to\r\ndefend the posts_; and that while these are preserved, the Indians must\r\nfind great security therefrom, and consequently the Americans greater\r\ndifficulty in taking their lands; but should they once become masters of\r\nthe posts, they will surround the Indians, and accomplish their purpose\r\nwith little trouble.\" [Footnote: Life of Brant, Vol. 2, p. 271.]\r\n\r\nThus it is seen that those at the head of British affairs in Canada, while\r\nthey studiously avoided coming into open collision with the United States,\r\nwere viewing with satisfaction the gathering war-cloud, and were lending\r\ntheir influence to extend and intensify its threatening character.\r\n\r\nThe only course left for the United States was to prepare for the\r\nconflict; and while forces were being summoned to take the field, they\r\nwere preceded by efforts of a pacific character.\r\n\r\nA treaty was held with the Six Nations at Fort Harmar, on the Muskingum,\r\nin January, 1789, by Gen. St. Clair, in behalf of the United States, with\r\na view to renew and confirm all the engagements, made at the treaty of\r\nFort Stanwix in 1784. Goods amounting to three thousand dollars were\r\ndistributed among the Indians, after the satisfactory conclusion and\r\nsigning of the treaty. [Footnote: Indian treaties.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time a treaty was concluded with the Wyandot, Delaware,\r\nOttawa, Chippewa, Pottowattamie and Sac nations, and goods distributed\r\namong them amounting to six thousand dollars, for a relinquishment of\r\ntheir claim to western lands.\r\n\r\nThese negotiations were doubtless attended with a beneficial influence,\r\nbut they could not arrest the tide of warlike feeling that had been\r\ncreated. Hostilities were continued throughout the long line of our\r\nfrontier settlements, and two of the Senecas having been killed by some\r\nbordermen of Pennsylvania, a great excitement was awakened among them.\r\n\r\nOur government, anxious to remove the new occasion of disaffection,\r\nimmediately disavowed the act, sought to bring the perpetrators of the\r\ncrime to justice, and invited a friendly conference of the Iroquois at\r\nTioga Point.\r\n\r\nThis council was convened on the sixteenth and remained in session until\r\nthe twenty-third of November, 1790.\r\n\r\nThe chiefs in attendance at this council, and who took an active part in\r\nits deliberations, were Fish Carrier, Farmer's Brother, Hendrick, Little\r\nBilly and Red Jacket.\r\n\r\nColonel Pickering, as commissioner on the part of the United States, was\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nRed Jacket, their principal speaker, portrayed in a vivid and strong\r\nlight, the sorrow they experienced, the injustice they had suffered, and\r\nthe unpleasant feelings aroused among them. A large number of Indians were\r\npresent, and were powerfully moved, and deeply affected by his speech.\r\n\r\nColonel Pickering, on the other hand, gave a very clear view of the facts\r\nin the case, showing conclusively the innocence of the government in the\r\nmurder committed, and after a time succeeded in allaying the excitement,\r\ndrying up their tears, and wiping out the blood that had been shed.\r\n\r\nThis council was enlivened by good cheer, and the observance of ceremonies\r\ncommon among the Indians.\r\n\r\nThomas Morris, who was present, was at this time adopted into one of their\r\ntribes. His father, Robert Morris of Philadelphia, having purchased of\r\nMassachusetts, in 1790, the pre-emptive right to that part of Western New\r\nYork, not sold to Phelps and Gorham, sent his son, as preparatory to the\r\nnegotiations he desired to make with the Indians, and for the general\r\nmanagement of his business connected with the undertaking, to reside in\r\nCanandaigua. While here he was diligent in cultivating an acquaintance\r\nwith the principal chiefs of the Iroquois confederacy, who resided in that\r\nregion. In this he was successful, and soon became a general favorite\r\namong them. He was in attendance with Colonel Pickering at Tioga Point,\r\nwhere the Indians determined to adopt him into the Seneca nation, and Red\r\nJacket bestowed upon him the name himself had borne, previous to his\r\nelevation to the dignity of Sachem; O-ti-ti-ani, \"_Always Ready_.\" It is\r\nbeautifully described by Colonel Stone, and is given in his language.\r\n\r\n\"The occasion of which they availed themselves to perform the cermony of\r\nconferring upon young Morris his new name, was a religious observance,\r\nwhen the whole sixteen hundred Indians present at the treaty, united in an\r\noffering to the moon, then being at her full. It was a clear night, and\r\nthe moon shone with uncommon brilliancy. The host of Indians, and their\r\nneophite, were all seated upon the ground in an extended circle, on one\r\nside of which a large fire was kept burning. The aged Cayuga chieftain,\r\nFish Carrier, who was held in exalted veneration for his wisdom, and who\r\nhad been greatly distinguished for his bravery from his youth up,\r\nofficiated as the high priest of the occasion;--making a long speech to\r\nthe luminary, occasionally throwing tobacco into the fire, as incense. On\r\nthe conclusion of the address, the whole company prostrated themselves\r\nupon the bosom of their parent earth, and a grunting sound of approbation\r\nwas uttered from mouth to mouth, around the entire circle.\r\n\r\n\"At a short distance from the fire a post had been planted in the earth,\r\nintended to represent the stake of torture, to which captives are bound\r\nfor execution. After the ceremonies in favor of Madam Luna had been ended,\r\nthey commenced a war-dance around the post, and the spectacle must have\r\nbeen as picturesque as it was animating and wild. The young braves engaged\r\nin the dance were naked, excepting a breech-cloth about their loins. They\r\nwere painted frightfully, their backs being chalked white, with irregular\r\nstreaks of red, denoting the streaming of blood. Frequently would they\r\ncease from dancing, while one of their number ran to the fire, snatching\r\nthence a blazing stick, placed there for that purpose, which he would\r\nthrust at the post, as though inflicting torture upon a prisoner. In the\r\ncourse of the dance they sung their songs, and made the forests ring with\r\ntheir wild screams and shouts, as they boasted of their deeds of war, and\r\ntold the number of scalps they had respectively taken, or which had been\r\ntaken by their nation. During the dance those engaged in it, as did others\r\nalso, partook freely of unmixed rum, and by consequence of the natural\r\nexcitement of the occasion, and the artificial excitement of the liquor\r\nthe festival had well nigh turned out a tragedy. It happened that among\r\nthe dancers was an Oneida warrior, who in striking the post, boasted of\r\nthe number of scalps taken by his nation during the war of the Revolution.\r\nNow the Oneidas, it will be recollected, had sustained the cause of the\r\ncolonies in that contest, while the rest of the Iroquois confederacy, had\r\nespoused that of the crown. The boasting of the Oneida warrior therefore,\r\nwas like striking a spark into a keg of powder. The ire of the Senecas was\r\nkindled in an instant, and they in turn boasted of the number of scalps\r\ntaken from the Oneidas in that contest. They moreover taunted the Oneidas\r\nas cowards. Quick as lightning the hands of the latter were upon their\r\nweapons, and in turn the knives and tomahawks of the Senecas began to\r\nglitter in the moon-beams, as they were hastily drawn forth. For an\r\ninstant it was a scene of anxious, almost breathless suspense, a death-\r\nstruggle seeming inevitable, when the storm was hushed by the\r\ninterposition of Old Fish Carrier, who rushed forward, and striking the\r\npost with violence, exclaimed '_You are all a parcel of boys. When you\r\nhave attained my age, and performed the warlike deeds that I have\r\nperformed, you may boast of what you have done; but not till then._'\r\n\r\n\"Saying which he threw down the post, put an end to the dance, and caused\r\nthe assembly to retire. This scene in its reality must have been one of\r\nabsorbing and peculiar interest. An assembly of nearly two thousand\r\ninhabitants of the forest, grotesquely clad in skins and strouds, with\r\nshining ornaments of silver, and their coarse raven hair falling over\r\ntheir shoulders, and playing wildly in the wind as it swept past, sighing\r\nmournfully among the giant branches of the trees above, such a group\r\ngathered in a broad circle of an opening in the wilderness, the starry\r\ncanopy of heaven glittering above them, the moon casting her silver mantle\r\naround their dusky forms, and a large fire blazing in the midst of them,\r\nbefore which they were working their spells, and performing their savage\r\nrites, must have presented a spectacle of long and vivid remembrance.\"\r\n[Footnote: Stone's Life and Times of Sa-go-ye-wat-ha.]\r\n\r\nThis meeting conducted with evident good feeling, served much to allay the\r\nexcitement and anger of the Senecas, and other tribes there represented,\r\nbut the question concerning their lands, was still agitated and created\r\ndissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nWith a view to obtain some concession in their favor, Cornplanter, Half\r\nTown and Big Tree visited Philadelphia, which was at that time the seat of\r\nthe general government, very soon after the council at Tioga Point. They\r\nwere especially anxious to obtain the restoration of a portion of land\r\nsouth of Lake Erie, and bordering upon Pennsylvania, which was occupied by\r\nHalf Town and his clan. They represented it as the land on which Half Town\r\nand all his people live, with other chiefs who always have been, and still\r\nare dissatisfied with the treaty at Fort Stanwix. \"They grew out of this\r\nland, and their fathers grew out of it, and they cannot be persuaded to\r\npart with it. _We therefore entreat you to restore to us this little\r\npiece._\"\r\n\r\nThis appeal, so simple and touching, was responded to by President\r\nWashington with great kindness. He reminded them that the treaty at Fort\r\nStanwix had been fully confirmed at Fort Harmar in 1789, that it was not\r\nwithin his province to annul the provisions of a treaty, especially one\r\nthat had been concluded before his administration commenced, yet he\r\nassured them that Half Town and his people, should not be disturbed, in\r\nthe peaceful occupancy of the land in question.\r\n\r\nFrom the friendly manner in which they were received and treated by the\r\nPresident, and the generous gifts bestowed, they returned home feeling\r\nsatisfied that the ruler of the thirteen fires would do them no injustice,\r\nand they were hence better reconciled to the people he governed. Before\r\nleaving, however, they were engaged to go in company with Colonel Proctor,\r\nof the Indian Department, on an embassy of peace to the hostile tribes at\r\nthe West, which was undertaken in the following spring.\r\n\r\nOn reaching their own country it was found that another outrage had been\r\ncommitted by a party of border-men, upon the Senecas at Beaver Creek, in\r\nthe neighborhood of Pittsburg, in which three men and one woman were\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nCornplanter immediately sent runners with a dispatch to the government,\r\ninforming them of the event, and with the earnest inquiry, \"Our father,\r\nand ruler over all mankind, _speak now and tell us, did you order those\r\nmen to be killed_?\"\r\n\r\nThe secretary of war utterly disclaimed and denounced the transaction,\r\npromised them restitution, and that the offenders should be brought to\r\njustice. These times were so fruitful in difficulties, that ere one was\r\nhealed another was created; yet our government by wise and prompt measures\r\nwere after this successful, in securing peace with all of the Iroquois\r\nfamily within its borders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nExpedition under Gen. Harmar--Its failure--High hopes of the Indians--Col.\r\nProctor's visit to the Indians at Buffalo Creek--Red Jacket's speech--\r\nIndian deputation refused--Interference of the matrons--Council at Painted\r\nPost--Chiefs invited to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe efforts of our government to secure peace with the Indians, were but\r\npartially successful. As our settlements extended westward in\r\nPennsylvania, and along the Ohio and Kentucky borders, Indian hostilities\r\nand depredations continued to multiply. From the year 1783 when peace was\r\nconcluded with Great Britain, until October, 1790, when the United States\r\ncommenced offensive operations against them, the Indians killed, wounded\r\nand took prisoners on the Ohio and the frontiers, about fifteen hundred\r\nmen, women and children; besides taking away two thousand horses, and a\r\nlarge amount of other property.\r\n\r\nThe Shawanese, Miamis and Wabash Indians were chiefly concerned in these\r\nbloody transactions; and our government finding protection for her\r\ncitizens could not be secured by pacific means, resolved to proceed with\r\nvigorous offensive measures.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harmar, a veteran of the Revolution, with a force of fourteen\r\nhundred and fifty men, three hundred and twenty from the regular army, and\r\nthe balance made up of recruits from Kentucky and Pennsylvania, advanced\r\ntoward the Indian country.\r\n\r\nThe expedition left Fort Washington, the present site of Cincinnati, on\r\nthe 30th of September, 1790.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, who kept watch of his movements, burned before his coming,\r\ntheir principal village and retired. Seizing a favorable opportunity, they\r\nfell suddenly upon a detachment of the main army commanded by Colonel\r\nHarding, consisting of two hundred and ten men, thirty of whom were\r\nregulars.\r\n\r\nAt the first onset the militia, the main part of the force, fled. The\r\nregulars stood their ground bravely for a time, but at a fearful odds;\r\nseven only escaped.\r\n\r\nColonel Harding, desirous of retrieving the disgrace, the next day with\r\nthree hundred militia and sixty regulars, gave battle to the Indians. They\r\nfought near the junction of St. Joseph and St. Mary rivers, and the\r\nstruggle, though severe and bloody, ended with the defeat of the\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nSuccess elated and emboldened the Indians, and rendered hopeless the\r\nnegotiations for peace. Nevertheless the mission of Colonel Proctor, with\r\na deputation from the Iroquois was not given up, and when spring opened he\r\nrepaired to their country, to be joined by Cornplanter, Red Jacket and\r\nothers, and proceed on his visit to the hostile tribes of the West.\r\n\r\nAnticipating his arrival, a council of the Iroquois had been called at\r\nBuffalo Creek. Already messengers had been sent, earnestly soliciting them\r\nto join the warriors that were rising everywhere, from toward the setting\r\nsun. They had defeated the Americans, and nothing was wanting but the\r\nunited action of all the Indian tribes, to secure the broad lands of the\r\nNorth-west, where they could spread their blankets in peace, and dwell\r\nsecurely forever. The Senecas, particularly, were urged to join in a war,\r\nthat opened so many hopeful and glorious anticipations. The distinguished\r\nwarrior Brant was very solicitous on this point, and being encouraged by\r\nthose at the head of British affairs in Canada, was sanguine of ultimate\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nColonel Proctor, accompanied by Cornplanter, arrived at the council fire\r\nkindled at Buffalo Creek, on the 27th of April, 1791.\r\n\r\nAmong the Indian chiefs present were Young King, Farmer's Brother and Red\r\nJacket. The latter had now an acknowledged pre-eminence among his people,\r\nand took a leading part in the deliberations of this council. It was\r\nopened by a speech from Red Jacket, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Brother: Listen. As is our custom we now address you, and we speak to you\r\nas to a brother that has been long absent. We all address you, and our\r\nchief warrior, Cornplanter; and we thank the Great Spirit for his and your\r\nsafe arrival, coming as you do hand in hand from Honandaganius [Footnote:\r\nName given to General Washington.] on important business.\r\n\r\n\"You have traveled long with tearful eyes, from the roughness of the way,\r\nand the inclemency of the season. Besides the difficulties between the bad\r\nIndians and our brothers the white people, everything has been conspiring\r\nto prevent your coming, thwart your business, and cause you to lose your\r\nway. The great waters might have prevented your coming; the wars might\r\nhave stopped you; sickness and death might have overtaken you, for we know\r\nnot what is to happen till it comes upon us. Therefore we thank the Great\r\nSpirit, who has preserved you from dangers, that would have prevented our\r\nhearing the good news you have come to bring us. And when filled with good\r\nnews, how is it possible that disasters should befall you on the way?\r\n\r\n\"Wipe therefore from your eyes, the tears that have been occasioned by the\r\ndangers through which you have come. We now place you upon a seat where\r\nyou can sit erect, a seat where you will be secure from the fear of your\r\nenemies, where you can look around upon all as your friends and brothers\r\nin peace.\r\n\r\n\"You have come with your heart and lips firmly closed, lest you should\r\nlose anything you had to say. With a brotherly hand we now open your\r\nhearts, and we remove the seal from your lips, that you may open them and\r\nspeak freely without obstruction. Your ears too have been closed, that\r\nthey might hear nothing until saluted by our voice. Open your ears to hear\r\nour counsels when we shall have had messages from you.\r\n\r\n\"We present therefore the compliments of the chiefs and head men of\r\nBuffalo Creek, to you and to our great warrior, the Cornplanter, hoping\r\nthat you may each proceed safely with your business.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Cornplanter replied briefly, in behalf of himself and Col.\r\nProcter, reciprocating the kindness manifested, in the welcome that had\r\nbeen given them.\r\n\r\nAfter which Col. Proctor explained fully the object of their coming, which\r\nwas to obtain from them a deputation of peace, to visit with him the\r\nhostile Indian tribes at the West; and assured them of the liberal views,\r\nand friendly feelings of the chief of the thirteen fires toward them.\r\n\r\nSeveral days were thereupon consumed in devising expedients and raising\r\nobjections, which terminated finally in the declaration that nothing could\r\nbe done without consulting their _British friends at Fort Niagara_.\r\nThey desired the colonel to go with them there. His business not being\r\nwith the British, but with them, he declined going. They then insisted\r\nupon having one of the officers of the fort to sit with them in council.\r\n\r\nThis being allowed, Col. Butler afterward appeared among them, and after a\r\nlittle private consultation with him, they seemed to be utterly averse to\r\nsending the proposed delegation.\r\n\r\nCaptain Brant, just before starting on a visit to western tribes, had been\r\nholding a consultation with these chiefs, and had no doubt been\r\ninfluential in causing them to be averse to joining this embassy.\r\n\r\nCol. Proctor, finding further negotiation hopeless, declared his purpose\r\nto return, and expressed his regret in having to carry back an unfavorable\r\nreport to the government, on whose kind and pacific errand he had been\r\nsent forth.\r\n\r\nThis announcement made a deep impression on their minds, and immediately a\r\nchange took place in their proceedings, which revealed a peculiar feature\r\nof Indian diplomacy.\r\n\r\nThe women, who had been carefully watching the proceedings of this\r\ncouncil, began to express their unwillingness to send to General\r\nWashington an unfavorable reply. To them was conceded the right, in things\r\npertaining to the safety of their homes, of reversing, if they thought\r\nproper, the decision of the men. They did so on this occasion, and\r\nemployed Red Jacket to present their views on the following day.\r\n\r\nIt was decided by them, in view of the threatening aspect of affairs, that\r\nCornplanter, their most experienced warrior, should not leave them; but\r\nthat a sufficient deputation, for which they had obtained volunteers,\r\nshould accompany Col. Proctor, at the same time advising him of the\r\ndanger, admonishing him to proceed with caution; \"_to reach his neck over\r\nthe land, and take in all the light he could, that would show him his\r\ndanger_.\"\r\n\r\nThe journey being regarded as too hazardous by land, and the Indians\r\nunwilling to perform it with their canoes, the case was decided by the\r\nBritish officers, who refused them a vessel for the undertaking.\r\n\r\nSo great was the excitement among the Indians at this time, that before\r\nthe result of Col. Proctor's mission was generally known, another council\r\nof the Iroquois was invited to meet at Painted Post, and was held during\r\nthe month of June following. The British officers at Niagara, and runners\r\nfrom the western tribes, exerted their influence to prevent the Iroquois\r\nfrom coming into alliances of peace with the United States. But through\r\nthe exertions of Col. Proctor, assisted by Cornplanter and the elderly\r\nmatrons, the minds of the leading chiefs were turned from the proposed\r\nwestern alliance to Colonel Pickering and the treaty ground at Painted\r\nPost.\r\n\r\nRed Jacket, together with other leading chiefs was present, and took an\r\nactive part in the deliberations of this council. It was well attended by\r\nthe Indians, as also by several American gentlemen, and a number of\r\nspeeches were interchanged, whose general drift was in the direction of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThe result of this gathering was satisfactory to all parties. It served to\r\nbind more closely the friendship of the leading chiefs to the United\r\nStates, and it served also to interest the minds of the young warriors,\r\nwho had else from a love of adventure followed the war path, with the\r\ntribes at the West.\r\n\r\nAt the close of this council, a large entertainment was prepared purely\r\nafter the civilized style, and when it was about concluded, Colonel\r\nPickering took occasion to place before them the blessings and advantages\r\nof a cultivated state of society; and the happy influences that would\r\narise from the introduction among them of the arts of civilized life. He\r\nassured them of the kind interest felt by General Washington and others in\r\ntheir welfare, and promised to aid them in any efforts they were disposed\r\nto make, for the advancement of their people. Presents were then liberally\r\ndistributed among them, and they were invited at a convenient time to\r\nvisit General Washington, and confer with him more fully on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were pleased with these suggestions, and promised to accept of\r\nthe proffered invitation. Thus happily closed this council, gathered amid\r\ndistracting influences, the Indians returning home better satisfied with\r\ntheir friendly attitude toward the government, and their feelings in\r\nstriking contrast with those of their brethren at the West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nExpedition to the Indian Country--Washington's charge to Gen. St. Clair--\r\nApproach to the Indian villages--Sudden surprise--Disasterous battle--\r\nIndian victory--Retreat of the Americans--Boldness of the Indians--\r\nFriendly Indian deputation--Welcome of the governor of Pennsylvania--Red\r\nJacket's reply--Address of President Washington--Reply of Red Jacket--\r\nCause of Indian hostilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndian hostilities still continued to destroy the peace and safety of our\r\nfrontier settlements. And Congress with a view to provide relief, resolved\r\nto increase our military force, and place in the hands of the Executive,\r\nmore ample means for their defense. A new expedition was therefore\r\nprojected. General St. Clair, governor of the territory west of the Ohio,\r\nwas appointed commander-in-chief of the forces to be employed.\r\n\r\nPresident Washington had been deeply pained by the disasters of General\r\nHarmar's expedition to the Wabash, resulting from Indian ambushes. In\r\ntaking leave of his old military comrade, St. Clair, he wished him success\r\nand honor; at the same time to put him on his guard, said,--\"You have your\r\ninstructions from the secretary of war. I had a strict eye to them, and\r\nwill add but one word--Beware of a surprise! You know how the Indians\r\nfight. I repeat it--_Beware of a surprise_!\" With these warning words\r\nsounding in his ear, St. Clair departed. [Footnote: Irving's life of\r\nWashington.]\r\n\r\nOn the seventh of September, 1791, General St. Clair set out for the\r\nIndian country. The American banner was unfurled and waved proudly over\r\ntwo thousand of her soldiers, as with sanguine hopes and bright\r\nanticipations, they took up their line of march for the Miami, designing\r\nto destroy the Indian villages on that river, expel the savages from the\r\nregion, and by establishing a line of posts to the Ohio river, prevent the\r\nIndians from returning to a point, where they had been the occasion of\r\ngreat mischief. On their way they constructed two forts, Hamilton and\r\nJefferson, and advanced but slowly, having to open for themselves a way\r\nthrough the forest. Too many of those composing this little army were\r\ndeficient in soldier-like qualities. They had been recruited from the off-\r\nscourings of large towns and cities, enervated by idleness, debauchery,\r\nand every species of vice, which unfitted them for the arduous service of\r\nIndian warfare. Hence insubordination, and frequent desertion, were among\r\nthe difficulties encountered.\r\n\r\nNot until the third of November, did they come near the Indian villages on\r\nthe Miami. On the evening of that day they selected a position on the bank\r\nof a creek, which favored their purpose, and bivouacked for the night.\r\nTheir number, from desertion, and those left to garrison the forts,\r\namounted to but fourteen hundred. The place of their encampment was\r\nsurrounded by close woods, dense thickets, and the trunks of fallen trees,\r\naffording a fine cover for stealthy Indian warfare.\r\n\r\nIt was the intention of St. Clair to throw up a slight work on the\r\nfollowing day, and then move on to attack the Indian villages. The plan of\r\nthis work he concerted in the evening with Major Ferguson, of the\r\nartillery. In the mean time, Colonel Oldham, an officer commanding the\r\nmilitia, was directed to send out that evening, two detachments, to\r\nexplore the country and gain what knowledge they could of the enemy. The\r\nmilitia showed signs of insubordination, complained of being too much\r\nfatigued, and the order apparently could not be enforced. The militia were\r\nencamped beyond the stream, about a quarter of a mile in advance, on a\r\nhigh flat, a position much more favorable than was occupied by the main\r\nbody. The placing of sentinels, about fifty paces from each other, formed\r\ntheir principal security against surprise.\r\n\r\nAt an early hour the next morning, the woods about the camp of the\r\nmilitia, swarmed with Indians, and a terrific yell, followed by sharp\r\nreports of the deadly rifle, were startling sounds, in the ear of the\r\nnewly recruited soldier. The militia returned a feeble fire, and\r\nimmediately fled toward the main body of the army. They came rushing in,\r\npell-mell and threw into disorder the front rank, drawn up in the order of\r\nbattle. The Indians, still keeping up their frightful yell, followed hard\r\nafter the militia, and would have entered the camp with them, but the\r\nsight of troops drawn up with fixed bayonets to receive them, checked\r\ntheir ardor, and stopping short they threw themselves behind logs and\r\nbushes, and poured in a deadly fire upon the first line, which was soon\r\nextended to the second. Our soldiers were mown down at a fearful rate.\r\n\r\nThe Indians fought with great desperation. They charged upon the center of\r\nthe two main divisions commanded by General Butler, and Colonel Darke with\r\nunexampled intrepidity. They aimed a destructive fire upon the\r\nartillerists from every direction, and swept them down by scores. The\r\nartillery if not very effective, was bravely served. A quantity of\r\ncanister and some round shot were thrown in the direction whence the\r\nIndians fired; but concealed as they were, and seen only occasionally, as\r\nthey sprang from one covert to another, it was impossible to direct the\r\npieces to advantage; and so effective was the fire upon them, that every\r\nartillery officer, and more than two-thirds of the men, were killed or\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nSt. Clair, unable to mount his horse, was borne about on a litter, and in\r\nthe midst of peril and disaster, gave his orders with coolness and\r\njudgment. Seeing to what disadvantage his troops fought with a concealed\r\nenemy, he ordered Colonel Darke, with his regiment of regulars, to rouse\r\nthe Indians from their covert with the bayonet, and turn their left flank.\r\nThis was executed with great spirit; the enemy were driven three or four\r\nhundred yards; but for want of cavalry or riflemen, the pursuit slackened,\r\nand the troops were forced to give back in turn, and the Indians came on\r\nwith a deadlier aim, the moment pursuit was relinquished. Strenuous\r\nefforts were made by the officers, early in the engagement, to restore\r\norder, which resulted in making themselves a mark, and they were cut down\r\nby the quick-sighted enemy.\r\n\r\nAll the officers of the Second regiment were cut off except three. The\r\ncontest disastrous from the first, had now continued for more than two\r\nhours and a half. The loss of so many officers, and the hopeless condition\r\nof the army, the half of them killed, and the situation of the remainder\r\ndesperate, brought discouragement to many a brave heart. It was useless to\r\nmake further effort, which promised only a more fatal result. A retreat\r\ntherefore was ordered, Colonel Darke being directed to charge the Indians\r\nthat intercepted the way toward Fort Jefferson, and Major Clark with his\r\nbattalion to cover the rear; these movements were successfully made, and\r\nthe most of the troops that remained collected in a body, with such of the\r\nwounded as could possibly hobble along with them; thus they departed,\r\nleaving their artillery and baggage.\r\n\r\nThe retreat, though disorderly, was accomplished without difficulty, as\r\nthe Indians did not pursue them far, from a desire to return for plunder.\r\nYet the entire way, for near thirty miles, the distance to Fort Jefferson,\r\nbore the marks of a trepidation that seemed to characterize the entire\r\nengagement. The soldiers continued to throw away their guns, knapsacks, or\r\nwhatever else impeded their flight, even when at a wide remove from all\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nThe army reduced by killed, wounded and desertion to about one-half its\r\noriginal number, fell back upon Fort Washington, the point of starting,\r\nand thus unfortunately closed a campaign, concerning which the highest\r\nexpectations had been entertained. It was a heavy blow upon our infant\r\nrepublic, and spread over our country a gloom, which was greatly deepened\r\nby a sorrow for the loss of many worthy and brave men, who though they\r\nfreely sacrificed their lives, could not avert these disasters.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, on account of this further victory, were elated beyond\r\nendurance, and conducted more haughtily than ever before. Their incursions\r\nwere more frequent, their depredations more extensive, and their cruelties\r\nmore excessive. The frontier inhabitants, especially of Pennsylvania, and\r\nKentucky, never felt more insecure, and were never more exposed to loss of\r\nlife, plunder and burning. In some instances whole settlements were broken\r\nup, by those who left their homes and sought, in the more densely peopled\r\nsections of the east, places of greater security.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances served to impart a deeper interest to the visit of a\r\nfriendly deputation, consisting of about fifty chiefs of the Iroquois, who\r\ncame to Philadelphia early in the spring of 1792, in compliance with the\r\nrequest of Colonel Pickering made at Painted Post the preceding year. Red\r\nJacket was a prominent member of this delegation.\r\n\r\nTheir presence had been solicited, with the view of calling the attention\r\nof the leading chiefs, to thoughts and efforts for the improvement of\r\ntheir race; as well as by kind and generous treatment, to bring them into\r\nfirmer alliance with the United States. And it is a pleasing thought that\r\namid the wrongs done to the Indian, we are able to point to earnest and\r\nwell intended endeavors, on the part of our government, to promote his\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\nThe governor of Pennsylvania cordially welcomed this deputation,\r\nrepresenting the happiness their coming had created, and assuring them\r\nthat every provision had been made, to render their stay agreeable,\r\nclosing his remarks in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Brothers: I know the kindness with which you treat strangers that visit\r\nyour country; and it is my sincere wish, that when you return to your\r\nfamilies, you may be able to assure them, that the virtues of friendship\r\nand hospitality, are also practiced by the citizens of Pennsylvania.\"\r\n\r\nTo this welcome Red Jacket, a few days afterward replied, apologizing for\r\nnot answering it sooner, and expressing the pleasure it afforded them, of\r\nmeeting in a place where their forefathers in times past, had been wont to\r\ngreet each other in peace and friendship, and declaring it as his wish,\r\nthat the same happy relations might be established, and exist between the\r\nUnited States and all of the Indian tribes.\r\n\r\nHis remarks on peace were introduced by a beautiful reference to a picture\r\nof Penn's treaty with the Indians, and an enconium on the governors of\r\nPennsylvania for their uniformly peaceable disposition.\r\n\r\nIt has been said of him as having occurred at a subsequent visit to the\r\nseat of our government, that when shown in the rotunda of the capitol, a\r\npanel representing, in sculpture, the first landing of the Pilgrims, with\r\nan Indian chief presenting them an ear of corn, in token of a friendly\r\nwelcome, he exclaimed,--\"_That was good.--The Indian knew they came from\r\nthe Great Spirit, and he was willing to share the soil with his\r\nbrothers._\"\r\n\r\nWhen another panel was pointed out to him representing Penn's treaty,--he\r\nexclaimed sadly,--\"_Ah! all's gone now._\" [Footnote: Drake's Book of\r\nthe Indians.]\r\n\r\nThe Indians were again addressed by President Washington, who gave them a\r\nhearty welcome to the seat of government, declaring that they had been\r\ninvited by his special request, to remove all causes of discontent, devise\r\nplans for their welfare, and cement a firm peace. He wished them to\r\npartake of all the comforts of the earth to be derived from civilized\r\nlife, to be enriched by industry, virtue and knowledge, and transmit these\r\ninvaluable blessings to their children.\r\n\r\nThe western Indians had charged the United States with an unjust\r\npossession of their lands. They desired no lands, he said, but such as had\r\nbeen fairly obtained by treaty, and he hoped the error might be corrected.\r\nFor the further explanation of his views and wishes, he commended them to\r\nGeneral Knox, the secretary of war, and Colonel Pickering; concluding his\r\naddress with these words:--\r\n\r\n\"As an evidence of the sincerity of the desire of the United States for\r\nperfect peace, and friendship with you, I deliver you this white belt of\r\nwampum, which I request you will safely keep.\"\r\n\r\nThe president having thus appointed Colonel Pickering and General Knox, to\r\nattend to the further conferences with the Indians, Red Jacket's reply to\r\nthe president's address, was made to them. His address was directed mainly\r\nto Colonel Pickering.\r\n\r\nTaking in his hand the belt presented by President Washington, he spoke\r\nvery much as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Your attention is now called to the words of the American Chief, when,\r\nthe other day he welcomed us to the great council fire of the thirteen\r\nUnited States. He said it was from his very heart; and that it gave him\r\npleasure to look around and see so large a representation of the Five\r\nNations of Indians. That it was at his special request we had been invited\r\nto the seat of the general government, with a view to promote the\r\nhappiness of our nation, in a friendly connection with the United States.\r\nHe said also that his love of peace did not terminate with the Five\r\nNations, but extended to all the nations at the setting sun, and it was\r\nhis desire that universal peace might prevail in this land.\r\n\r\n\"What can we, your brothers of the Five Nations, say in reply to this part\r\nof his speech, other than to thank him, and say it has given a spring to\r\nevery passion of our souls.\r\n\r\n\"The sentiment of your chief, who wishes our minds might all be disposed\r\nto peace,--a happy peace, so firm that nothing shall move it,--that it may\r\nbe founded on a rock,--this comparison of the peace to a _rock, which is\r\nimmovable_, has given joy to our hearts.\r\n\r\n\"The president observed also, that by our continuing in the path of peace,\r\nand listening to his counsel, we might share with you all the blessings of\r\ncivilized life; this meets with our approbation, and he has the thanks of\r\nall your brothers of the Five Nations.\r\n\r\n\"And further, that if we attended to his counsel in this matter, our\r\nchildren and children's children, might partake of all the blessings which\r\nshould rise out of this earth.\r\n\r\n\"The president observed again, that what he had spoken was in the\r\nsincerity of his heart, and that time and opportunity would give evidence\r\nthat what he said was true. And we believe it because the words came from\r\nhis own lips, and they are lodged deep in our minds.\r\n\r\n\"He said also that it had come to his ears that the cause of the\r\nhostilities of the western Indians, was their persuasion that the United\r\nStates had unjustly taken their lands. But he assured us this was not the\r\ncase; that none of his chiefs desired to take any of their land, without\r\nagreeing for it; and that the land, given up at the treaty at Muskingum,\r\nhe concluded had been fairly obtained.\r\n\r\n\"He said to us that in his opinion the hostile Indians were in error, that\r\nwhatever evil spirit, or lies had turned them aside, he wished could be\r\ndiscovered, that they might be removed. He had a strong wish that any\r\nobstacles to the extension of peace westward, might be discovered, so that\r\nthey might be removed.\r\n\r\n\"In conclusion he observed that our professions of friendship and regard,\r\nwere commonly witnessed by some token; therefore in the name of the United\r\nStates, he presented us with this white belt, which was to be handed down\r\nfrom one generation to another, in confirmation of his words, and as a\r\nwitness of the friendly disposition of the United States, towards the\r\npeace and happiness of the five confederated nations.\"\r\n\r\nRed Jacket here laid down the white belt presented by the president, and\r\ntaking up a belt of their own, continued his speech as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Now let the president of the United States possess his mind in peace. Our\r\nreply to his address to us the other day has been brief, for the belt he\r\ngave us is deposited with us, and we have taken firm hold of it. We return\r\nour united thanks for his address, in welcoming us to the seat of the\r\ngreat council, and for the advice he has given us.\r\n\r\n\"We have additional pleasure in knowing that you, Con-neh-sauty [Footnote:\r\nCol. Pickering.] are appointed to assist us, in devising the means to\r\npromote and secure the happiness of the Six Nations.\r\n\r\n\"Now open your ears, Representatives of the Great Council, Hear the words\r\nwe speak. All present of the Great Council, [Footnote: Referring to\r\nmembers of Congress present.] and our brethren of the Five Nations, hear!\r\nWe consider ourselves in the presence of the Great Spirit, the proprietor\r\nof us all.\r\n\r\n\"The president has in effect told us we are freemen, the sole proprietors\r\nof the soil on which we live. This has gladdened our hearts, and removed a\r\nweight that was upon them. This indeed is to us an occasion of joy, for\r\nhow can two brothers speak freely together, unless they feel they are upon\r\nequal ground?\r\n\r\n\"We now speak freely, as they are free from pressure, and we join with the\r\npresident in his wish, that all the evils which have hitherto disturbed\r\nour peace, may be buried in oblivion. This is the sincere wish of our\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Brother, continue to hear, let all present open their ears, while\r\nthose of the Five Nations here present speak _with one voice_. We wish\r\nto see your words verified to our children, and children's children. You\r\nenjoy all the blessings of this life; to you therefore we look to make\r\nprovision, that the same may be enjoyed by our children. This wish comes\r\nfrom our heart, but we add that our happiness cannot be great if, in the\r\nintroduction of your ways, we are put under too much constraint.\r\n\r\n\"Continue to hear. We, your brothers of the Five Nations, believe that the\r\nGreat Spirit let this island [Footnote: The Indians use the term _island_,\r\nin speaking of this continent.] drop down from above. We also believe in\r\nhis superintendency over this whole island. He gives peace and prosperity,\r\nhe also sends evil. Prosperity has been yours. American brethren, all the\r\ngood which can spring out of this island, you enjoy. We wish, therefore,\r\nthat we and our children, and our children's children, may partake with\r\nyou of that enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\"I observe that the Great Spirit might smile on one people, and frown on\r\nanother. This you have seen, who are of one color, and one blood. The king\r\nof England, and you Americans strove to advance your happiness by\r\nextending your possessions on this island, which produces so many good\r\nthings. And while you two great powers were contending for those good\r\nthings, by which the whole island was shaken, violently agitated, is it\r\nstrange that our peace, the peace of the Five Nations, was shaken and\r\noverthrown?\r\n\r\n\"But I will say no more of the trembling of this island. All in a measure\r\nis now quiet. Peace is restored. Our peace, the peace of the Five Nations\r\nis beginning to bud forth. But still there is some shaking among our\r\nbrethren at the Setting Sun; and you, of the thirteen fires, and the king\r\nof England know what is our situation and the cause of this disturbance.\r\nHere now, you have an ambassador, [Footnote: Referring to the British\r\nenvoy to the United States.] as we are informed from the king of England.\r\nLet him in behalf of the king, and the Americans, adjust all their\r\nmatters, according to their agreement, at the making of peace--and then\r\nyou will soon see all things settled among the Indian nations. Peace will\r\nextend far and near. Let the president and the ambassador use all their\r\nexertions to bring about this settlement, according to the peace, and it\r\nwill make us all glad, and we shall consider both as our real friends.\r\n\r\n\"Brother: Continue to hear! Be assured we have spoken not from our lips\r\nonly, but from our very hearts. Allow us then to say: That when you\r\nAmericans and the king made peace, he did not mention us, showed us no\r\ncompassion, notwithstanding all he said to us, and all we had suffered.\r\nThis has been the occasion to us, the Five Nations, of great loss, sorrow\r\nand pain. When you and he settled the peace between you two great nations,\r\nhe never asked for a delegation from us, to attend to our interests. Had\r\nthis been done, a settlement of peace among all the western nations might\r\nhave been effected. But neglecting this, and passing us by unnoticed, has\r\nbrought upon us great pain and trouble.\r\n\r\n\"It is evident that we of the Five Nations have suffered much in\r\nconsequence of the strife between you and the king of England, who are of\r\none color and of one blood. But our chain of peace has been broken. Peace\r\nand friendship have been driven from us. Yet you Americans were determined\r\nnot to treat us in the same manner as we have been treated by the king of\r\nEngland. You therefore desired us at the re-establishment of peace, to sit\r\ndown at our ancient fireplaces, and again enjoy our lands. And had the\r\npeace between you and the king of England been completely accomplished, it\r\nwould long before this have extended far beyond the Five Nations.\r\n\r\n\"BROTHER CON-NEH-SAUTY: We have rejoiced in your appointment, for you are\r\nspecially appointed with General Knox, to confer with us on our peace and\r\nhappiness. We hope the great warrior will remember, that though a\r\n_warrior_, he is to converse with us about _peace_; letting what concerns\r\nwar sleep; and the counselling part of his mind, while acting with us, be\r\nof _peace_.\r\n\r\n\"Have patience, and continue to listen. The president has assured us that\r\nhe is not the cause of the hostilities now existing at the westward, but\r\nlaments it. Brother, we wish you to point out to us of the Five Nations,\r\n_what you think is the real cause_.\r\n\r\n\"We now publicly return our thanks to the president, and all the\r\ncounsellors of the thirteen United States, for the words he has spoken to\r\nus. They were good, unqualifiedly good. Shall we observe that he wished\r\nthat if the errors of the hostile Indians could be discovered, he would\r\nuse his utmost exertions to remove them?\r\n\r\n\"BROTHER! You and the king of England are the two governing powers of this\r\nisland. What are we? You both arc important and proud; and you cannot\r\nadjust your own affairs agreeably to your declarations of peace. Therefore\r\nthe western Indians are bewildered. One says one thing to them, and\r\nanother says another. Were these things adjusted, it would be easy to\r\ndiffuse peace everywhere.\r\n\r\n\"In confirmation of our words, we give this belt, which we wish the\r\npresident to hold fast, in remembrance of what we have now spoken.\"\r\n[Footnote: This speech, given by Col. Stone from a manuscript of J. W.\r\nMoulton, Esq., on account of its importance, is presented almost entire. A\r\nfew changes have been made, but the ideas of the orator, and the language\r\nmostly in which they are given, have been strictly maintained, while the\r\nchanges are no greater than would have been made, had two reporters taken\r\nthe words as they came from the lips of the orator.]\r\n\r\nA very touching reference is made in this speech, to the manner in which\r\nthe Indians had been treated by Great Britain, when peace was concluded\r\nwith the United States. Notwithstanding the promises and high expectations\r\nheld out to them, at the commencement of the war, and their sacrifices and\r\nservices during its continuance, no notice was taken, no mention made of\r\nthem in the treaty of peace. In the expressive language of Red Jacket,\r\n\"_the king showed them no compassion_.\" They had for years fought side\r\nby side with the soldiers of Britain, they had, with stealthy tread, come\r\ndown upon our settlements far removed from the seat of war, surprised\r\npeaceful inhabitants, slain defenseless women and children, plundered and\r\nburned their dwellings, and wrought in the hearts of the American people a\r\nsense of wrong, that cried for redress. What could be their position, now\r\nthat the armies of Britain are withdrawn? The armies of Britain defeated,\r\ncould they, single handed, cope with the American army? These were\r\nquestions that weighed deeply on their minds. Did they expect the hand of\r\nfriendship to be extended toward them? To be invited to councils of peace,\r\n--to the intimacies, hospitalities, and kindly feeling manifested on this\r\noccasion? The orator was deeply impressed by it, and notes the contrast\r\napparent in the conduct toward them, of Britain and America. \"_You\r\nAmericans were determined not to treat us in the same manner, as we had\r\nbeen treated by the king of England. You desired us at the re-\r\nestablishment of peace, to sit down at our ancient fire-places, and again\r\nenjoy our lands_.\" He further very significantly refers to the occasion of\r\nthe hostile feelings among the Indians at the West. It was because the\r\npeace between England and America \"_had not been fully accomplished_.\" In\r\nother words, hostile feelings were still cherished, and their _outward\r\nmanifestation_ could be seen, in the plundering and massacres, still\r\ncarried on among our frontier settlements. The establishment of a _true\r\npeace_ between the two countries,--the existence and cultivation of\r\ngenuine amicable relations between them, would, in his view, end all this\r\ntrouble, and \"_diffuse peace everywhere_.\"\r\n\r\nWe have already had occasion to notice the unfriendly feeling, cherished\r\nby the British Indian Department in Canada, toward the United States; and\r\nevidence will be afforded further on, of their being deeply implicated in\r\nthe hostilities endured, coming from the Indians on our western border.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nIndian appropriation--Embassy sent West--Instructions--Medal presented to\r\nRed Jacket--Military suits--Close of conference--Washington's parting\r\nwords--Visit of Thayendanegea--Council at Au Glaize--Result--Another\r\ncommission--Indian diplomacy--Washington's letter to Mr. Jay--Commission\r\ngoes West--Various interviews--Result of council--Re-organization under\r\nGeneral Wayne--Ready for action--Advice of Little Turtle--Wayne's battle\r\nand victory--Treaty of peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile these Indian chiefs were at Philadelphia, a bill was passed by\r\nCongress, and ratified by the president, appropriating fifteen hundred\r\ndollars annually, for the benefit of the Iroquois, in purchasing for them\r\nclothing, domestic animals, implements of husbandry, and for encouraging\r\nuseful artificers to reside in their villages.\r\n\r\nThey were engaged also to go on a pacific embassy to the hostile Indians\r\nof the West, and assure them of the friendly disposition of the United\r\nStates toward them;--that they want nothing which belongs to the hostile\r\nIndians;--that they appointed commissioners to treat with them for their\r\nlands, and give them a large quantity of goods;--that a number of chiefs\r\nsigned the deeds, and from the reports of the commissioners, it was\r\nsupposed the lands had been fairly obtained;--that under this supposition\r\nlarge tracts had been sold, and hence difficult to restore again; but as\r\nthe United States desire only what is just, they will attentively hear the\r\ncomplaints of the western Indians;--they will re-examine the treaties, and\r\ninquire into the manner in which they were conducted;--and if the\r\ncomplaints of the western Indians, appear to be well founded, the United\r\nStates will make them ample compensation for their lands. They will do\r\nmore;--so far from desiring to injure, they would do them good; they would\r\ncheerfully impart to them that knowledge, and those arts, by which they\r\npropose to increase the happiness, and promote the welfare of the Six\r\nNations.\r\n\r\nIt was during this visit that President Washington, in token of his\r\nfriendship and esteem, gave Red Jacket a large silver medal bearing his\r\nlikeness, which he ever after preserved with much care, and took great\r\npride in wearing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE WASHINGTON PRESIDENT. 1792.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Knox, the secretary of war, directed also that a military suit of\r\nclothes be given to each member of the deputation, including a cocked hat,\r\nas worn by the officers of the United States army. When Red Jacket's suit\r\nwas presented to him he eyed it carefully, and rather admiringly, but\r\nrequested the bearer to inform General Knox that the suit would hardly\r\nbecome him, as he was not a war-chief but a sachem, the sachems being\r\ncivil, rather than military officers. He desired therefore that another\r\nsuit be prepared, which would accord better with the relation he sustained\r\nto his people; at the same time declaring the one sent very good, and\r\nmanifesting a disposition to retain it, until the other was prepared. A\r\nplain suit was accordingly prepared and brought to him, and with this he\r\nseemed to be highly pleased. The bearer tarrying a little, and manifesting\r\na readiness to carry back the other suit, Red Jacket coolly and rather\r\nplayfully remarked, that though the present suit was more in keeping with\r\nhis character as sachem, it nevertheless, occurred sometimes, in cases of\r\nemergency, that the sachems also went to war, and as it would then be very\r\nbecoming and proper for him to wear it, he was happy to have one in case a\r\ncircumstance of this kind should occur.\r\n\r\nThese Indian chiefs were all highly gratified with the attention shown\r\nthem, during this visit to the general government. They were especially\r\npleased with the interest that had been taken in the improvement of their\r\npeople, and the pledges they had received of aid in carrying out the\r\nbenevolent designs entertained toward them. And they all, Red Jacket with\r\nthe rest, were favorably impressed with the views of Washington, in\r\ndesiring to introduce among them the improvements of civilized life.\r\n\r\nThese conferences were brought to a close on the thirtieth of April, and\r\nPresident Washington in a concluding speech, said to them,--\"When you\r\nreturn to your country, tell your nation that it is my desire to promote\r\ntheir prosperity, by teaching them the use of domestic animals, and the\r\nmanner that the white people plough and raise so much corn, and if upon\r\nconsideration, it would be agreeable to the nation at large, to learn\r\nthose arts, I will find some means of teaching them at some places within\r\ntheir country, as shall be agreed upon.\" [Footnote: Irving's Life of\r\nWashington.]\r\n\r\nThe government had taken special pains also to secure the attendance of\r\nthe celebrated Thayendanegea or Brant, with this deputation of friendly\r\nchiefs. The invitation, though a pressing one, was declined, and not\r\nwithout reason. For besides the powerful influence exerted over him by the\r\nofficers of the British government in Canada, who strenuously opposed his\r\ncoming, it has since been ascertained that he was the leading spirit who\r\ndirected with so much success to the Indians, the onslaught upon General\r\nSt. Clair's army, the preceding fall. Hence his own feelings could not\r\nhave been of the most friendly character. He was, nevertheless, induced to\r\nvisit the seat of government during the month of June following, and\r\npledged himself to exert his influence in an effort to secure peace for\r\nthe United States, with the Indians at the West.\r\n\r\nA very large Indian council, composed of delegates from many and some of\r\nthem very distant nations, was held at Au Glaize, on the Miami of Lake\r\nErie, in the autumn of 1792. A large delegation from the Six Nations,\r\nfriendly to the United States, was present and took part in the\r\ndeliberations. Red Jacket was the principal speaker, and strenuously\r\nadvocated the settlement of their difficulties, by peaceful negotiations\r\ninstead of war.\r\n\r\nThe Shawanese as strenuously advocated the continuance of hostilities.\r\nThey taunted the Six Nations with having induced them to form a great\r\nconfederacy, a few years before, and of having come to the council now,\r\n\"with the voice of the United States folded under their arm;\"--referring\r\nto the belt which was significant of their embassy.\r\n\r\nThe Shawanese, Miamis and Kickapoos were addicted to horse-stealing, and\r\nwhile hostilities were continued, they reaped from this source, their\r\ngreatest harvests.\r\n\r\nCaptain Brant on account of sickness was unable to be present, and it may\r\nbe noticed that from this time on, his efforts to form a North-western\r\nIndian Confederacy, were very sensibly remitted. He no doubt found there\r\nwere so many conflicting interests and national jealousies in the way, as\r\nto render the project comparatively hopeless. But more than all, he had\r\ndepended upon the following of the entire body, composed of the Six\r\nNations, and when he saw them coming largely under the influence of the\r\nUnited States, he could realize that the strength and permanence of his\r\ncontemplated position, were so seriously affected, as to render its\r\nattainment extremely doubtful. The addition of the entire Iroquois family,\r\nto the proposed confederation, would have brought into it an element of\r\nintellectual superiority, and their long established polity of acting in\r\nconcert, would have been of essential service among forces that were wild\r\nand chaotic. And we are not surprised that the diversion effected among\r\nthem, should have changed somewhat the views of the distinguished\r\nThayendanegea.\r\n\r\nNo decisive action was reached at this council, but an agreement was made\r\nto suspend hostilities during the winter, provided the United States would\r\nwithdraw their troops from the west side of the Ohio; and another council\r\nwas appointed to meet at the Miami Rapids during the following spring.\r\n\r\nThe Iroquois delegation forwarded to our government a report of the\r\nservice they had rendered, the action taken by the council, and the\r\nagreement to meet in the spring, and requested that agents might be sent,\r\n\"who were men of honesty, not land-jobbers, but men who love and desire\r\npeace. We also desire that they may be accompanied by some Friend, or\r\nQuaker, to attend the council.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of February, 1793, General Benjamin Lincoln, Beverly Randolph\r\nand Colonel Pickering were commissioned by the president to attend the\r\ngreat Indian council at Miami Rapids, in the ensuing spring.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Indians, dissatisfied with the views of the president, as\r\ntransmitted by the Six Nations, held another council at Au Glaize in\r\nFebruary, and framed a very explicit address to the Six Nations, affirming\r\nthey would listen to no proposition from the United States, that did not\r\nconcede the Ohio river, as the boundary line between them, and the Indian\r\ncountry. They desired the United States to be fully apprised of this,\r\nbefore sending their delegation; and they notified the Six Nations of a\r\nprivate council at Miami Rapids, before meeting the American\r\ncommissioners, to adjust their opinions, so as to speak but one language\r\nat the council; they further declared their intention not to meet the\r\ncommissioners at all, until assured they had authority to conclude a\r\ntreaty on this basis.\r\n\r\nIn this determination they were encouraged, and sustained by the British\r\nIndian Department of Canada. President Washington, in a letter to Mr. Jay,\r\nour minister in London, writing in 1794, very clearly sets forth the work\r\nthus accomplished.--He says:--\"There does not remain a doubt, in the mind\r\nof any well informed person in this country, not shut against conviction,\r\nthat all the difficulties we encounter with the Indians, their\r\nhostilities, the murder of helpless women and children, along our\r\nfrontiers, result from the conduct of agents of Great Britain in this\r\ncountry. In vain is it then for its administration in Britain to disavow\r\nhaving given orders which will warrant such conduct, whilst their agents\r\ngo unpunished; while we have a thousand corroborating circumstances, and\r\nindeed as many evidences, some of which cannot be brought forward, to\r\nprove that they are seducing from our alliances, and endeavoring to remove\r\nover the line, tribes that have hitherto been kept in peace and friendship\r\nat great expense, and who have no causes of complaint, except pretended\r\nones of their creating; whilst they keep in a state of irritation the\r\ntribes that are hostile to us, and are instigating those who know little\r\nof us or we of them, to unite in the war against us; and whilst it is an\r\nundeniable fact, that they are furnishing the _whole with arms,\r\nammunition, clothing, and even provisions to carry on the war_, I might go\r\nfarther, and if they are not much belied, add, _men in disguise_.\"\r\n[Footnote: Marshall's Washington.]\r\n\r\nThe commissioners of the United States appointed to confer with the Indian\r\ntribes at the West, proceeded on their way, arriving at Niagara the latter\r\npart of May, 1793. Here they were very kindly entertained by Governor\r\nSimcoe until the council was ready to receive them.\r\n\r\nWhile here they were visited by a large deputation from the council at\r\nMiami Rapids, who desired an explicit answer to the inquiry whether they\r\nwere authorized to run and establish a new boundary? Which they answered\r\nin the affirmative, at the same time reminding the Indians that in almost\r\nall disputes there were wrongs on both sides, and that, at the approaching\r\ncouncil, both parties must expect to make some concessions.\r\n\r\nThis reply was well received and sanguine hopes were entertained of a\r\nfavorable termination of their mission.\r\n\r\nThe Indians returned again to their council at Miami, and the\r\ncommissioners supposing they would now be prepared to receive them,\r\nproceeded on their voyage westward. Arriving at the mouth of Detroit river\r\nthey were obliged to land, being forbidden by the British authorities to\r\nproceed any farther toward the place of meeting.\r\n\r\nThey were met here by another Indian deputation, bringing a paper with a\r\nwritten statement of their determination, to make the Ohio the boundary\r\nline between the Indian country and the United States, and requiring the\r\nlatter, if sincere in their desires for peace, to remove their settlements\r\nto the south side of that river. To this the commissioners were desired to\r\ngive an explicit written answer.\r\n\r\nThey replied, referring to the understanding from their conference at\r\nNiagara, that some concessions were to be made on both sides, and giving a\r\nbrief history of the treaties by which a title had been acquired to land\r\nnorth of the Ohio, on the faith of which, settlements had been formed\r\nwhich could not be removed; hence they answered explicitly.--\"_The Ohio\r\nriver cannot be designated as the boundary line._\"\r\n\r\nThey expressed the hope that negotiations might proceed on the basis of\r\nthese treaties, closing with some concessions, and liberal offers for some\r\nlands still held by the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe debate at this council, it is said, ran high. Thayendanegea, and\r\nothers of the Six Nations were strenuous in their advocacy of peace. The\r\noffer of the commissioners to establish a boundary line that would include\r\nthe settlements already made north of the Ohio, they regarded as\r\nreasonable, and that farther concessions ought not to be required. Quite a\r\nnumber of tribes were influenced to adopt this view, which at one time it\r\nwas thought would prevail. But there were certain ruling spirits present\r\ndetermined to make no concession, and the council broke up without\r\nallowing the commissioners, or any other white person, not in sympathy\r\nwith Britain, to be present.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the holding of this council, the army had been re-organized\r\nunder the command of General Anthony Wayne, an officer of untiring energy\r\nand vigilance; a larger number of soldiers had been called into the field,\r\nand as they were placed under a severe discipline, to inure them to the\r\ndangers and hardships of the campaign, it was undertaken with flattering\r\nprospects of success.\r\n\r\nPittsburgh had been made the place of rendezvous; but fearing the\r\ninfluence of an encampment near a town, and wishing to inspire in his\r\nsoldiers a feeling of self reliance, General Wayne, on the 27th of\r\nNovember, 1792, marched his army to a point twenty-two miles distant on\r\nthe Ohio, which he called Legionville, fortifying it and taking up his\r\nquarters there for the winter.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of April, 1793, as spring had opened, he broke up his garrison\r\nat Legionville, and led his army down the river, to Fort Washington, its\r\nsite being that of the present beautiful and flourishing city of\r\nCincinnati.\r\n\r\nHere he remained while the negotiations were going on with the Indians at\r\nthe West. As soon as they were ended and the result known, he took a more\r\nadvanced position, marching in October in the direction pursued by,\r\nGeneral St. Clair, to a point on the south-west branch of the Miami, six\r\nmiles beyond Fort Jefferson, and eighty from Fort Washington, which he\r\nfortified and called Greenville.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of December, a detachment of the army commanded by Major\r\nBurbeck took possession of the ground where the army of General St. Clair,\r\ntwo years before on the 4th of the preceding November, had sustained a\r\nterrible defeat. Here they gathered up sadly and sacredly the bones that\r\nmarked this as a place of human slaughter, put in order the field-pieces\r\nthat were still upon the ground, served them with a round of three times\r\nthree, over the remains of their fallen comrades, and erected a fortress,\r\nappropriately naming it Fort Recovery.\r\n\r\nThe army at different points had skirmishes with the enemy that were not\r\nserious, but they served to create confidence and inspire courage in the\r\nminds of the soldiers.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the 20th of August, 1794, that General Wayne had a\r\nregular engagement with the Indians. Yet like a true gladiator he had been\r\npreparing for the struggle, and his wariness, which had gained for him the\r\ntitle of \"_Black Snake_\" may be gathered from the speech of Little Turtle,\r\nchief of the Miamis, and one of the most active and brave warriors of his\r\ntime. He counselled his countrymen to think favorably of the proposals of\r\npeace offered by General Wayne before giving them battle; saying,--\"We\r\nhave beaten the enemy twice under separate commanders. We cannot expect\r\nthe same good fortune always to attend us. The Americans are now led by a\r\nchief who never sleeps. The night and the day are alike to him; and during\r\nall the time he has been marching on our villages, notwithstanding the\r\nwatchfulness of our young men, we have never been able to surprise him.\r\nThere is something that whispers to me,--_it would be prudent to listen to\r\nhis offers of peace_.\"\r\n\r\nBut this counsel was rejected by the Indians, who determined to give\r\nbattle to the Americans the next day. They fought in the vicinity of a\r\nBritish fort, which Governor Simcoe of Canada had caused to be erected at\r\nthe foot of the rapids of the Miami emptying into the lakes, far within\r\nthe acknowledged territory of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe ground occupied by the Indians was well chosen, being a thick wood,\r\nwhere were old fallen trees that marked the track of some ancient\r\nhurricane, where the use of cavalry would be impracticable, a place suited\r\nto afford them shelter and well adapted to their peculiar mode of warfare.\r\nBut the order of General Wayne to advance with trailed arms, and rouse the\r\nIndians from their covert at the point of the bayonet, and when up deliver\r\na close and well directed fire on their backs, followed by a brisk charge,\r\nso as not to give them time to load again; was executed so promptly, and\r\nwith so much effect that the Indians were driven in one hour more than two\r\nmiles, and soon dispersed in terror and dismay, leaving the ground in full\r\nand quiet possession of the victorious army.\r\n\r\nThis battle, which terminated within reach of the British guns, decided\r\nthe fate of the campaign. The Indians after this were dispirited and\r\nunable to make a general rally. The distrust awakened by the coolness of\r\ntheir supposed friends, the gates of whose fort remained unopened while\r\nthey were fleeing thither for a covert, served not less than the victory\r\nto dishearten them, and incline their thoughts toward peace.\r\n\r\nThe few days spent by the army on the battle ground after its victory,\r\nwere occupied in destroying the property of the Indians in that vicinity,\r\nincluding also the extensive possessions of Colonel McKee, an officer of\r\nthe British Indian Department, whose influence had been exerted in\r\npromoting these hostilities, whose effects were now being experienced. The\r\nfort itself was poised in the General's mind, as was also the torch of the\r\ngunner, who was only restrained by his commanding officer from firing upon\r\nWayne, who, as he thought came too near, in making his observations on one\r\nof His Majesty's forts. Prudence prevailed. The fighting was confined to a\r\nwar of words in a spirited correspondence between General Wayne, and the\r\nofficer in command of the fort.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wayne after laying waste their principal towns in this region,\r\ncontinued in the Indian country during the following year, bringing his\r\ncampaign to a close by a treaty with the North-western tribes, which was\r\nentirely agreeable to the wishes of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nCanandaigua at an early day--Facts in the early settlement of Bloomfield--\r\nIndian Council--Its object--Indian parade--Indian dress--Opening of\r\nCouncil--Speeches--Liberal offers of the government--Mr. Savary's Journal\r\n--Treaty concluded--Account of Red Jacket by Thomas Morris.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanandaigua at an early day was the objective point for all who were\r\nseeking what was called the Genesee country. It was at the head of\r\nnavigation. Parties coming from the east could transport their goods by\r\nwater from Long Island Sound to Canandaigua, with the exception of one or\r\ntwo carrying places, where they were taken by land.\r\n\r\nWe can hardly realize that at that time there was here a widely extended\r\nforest, in all its loneliness and grandeur. Its first trees were cut down\r\nin the fall of 1788, soon after Mr. Phelps had concluded his treaty of\r\npurchase with the Indians. By means of them a log store-house was\r\nconstructed, near the outlet of the lake. The family of a Mr. Joseph Smith\r\ntook possession of it in the spring of 1789. Judge J. H. Jones, who in the\r\nfall of 1788, was one of a party to open a road between Geneva and\r\nCanandaigua, witnessed, on revisiting the latter place in 1789, a great\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n\"When we left,\" he says, \"in the fall of '88, there was not a solitary\r\nperson there;--when I returned fourteen months afterwards, the place was\r\nfull of people; residents, surveyors, explorers, adventurers; houses were\r\ngoing up; it was a thriving, busy place.\" During the following year quite\r\na nucleus for a town had gathered here. In 1794, Mrs. Sanborne, an\r\nenterprising landlady, whose eye kindled with the recollection of those\r\ndays, served up in a tea saucer the first currants produced in the Genesee\r\ncountry. [Footnote: Conversation of the author with Mrs. Sanborne.]\r\nCanandaigua at that time and for many years after was head-quarters for\r\nall who were making their way into what at that time was called the Indian\r\ncountry, and from the respectability and enterprise of its early\r\ninhabitants, it became attractive as a place of residence.\r\n\r\nBut though considerable improvements had been made here, the entire region\r\nwas new, romantic and wild. Such was its condition at the time of the\r\ngreat Indian council that convened here in the autumn of 1794. Indians and\r\ndeer, and wolves, and bear were very abundant and were mingled with the\r\nearly associations of those who contributed to make this an abode of\r\nelevation and refinement. The cow-boy, often startled while on his way by\r\nthe appearance of a bear, went timidly forth on his evening errand,\r\ninspired with courage by the thought that he might, for his protection,\r\nshoulder a gun. Bear incidents, narrow escapes from fighting with bears,\r\nand bear stories of every description, entered largely into the staple of\r\ntheir conversation, and many an evening's hour was thus beguiled away,\r\naround the huge and brightly blazing fire of the early pioneer.\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear,\" said a Mrs. Chapman to a Mrs. Parks, how neighbor Codding\r\ncame near being killed yesterday?\r\n\r\n\"Mercy! no. How did it happen?\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Codding was in the woods splitting rails, and just as he was turning\r\naround to take up his axe to cut a sliver, don't you believe he saw a\r\ngreat bear sitting up on his hind legs, and holding out both fore paws\r\nready to grab him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercy on us! What did he do?\r\n\r\n\"What did he do? He took up his axe, and instead of cutting the sliver,\r\ncut into the old bear's head. But the axe glanced and only cut into the\r\nflesh, without killing the bear, and he ran away with the axe sticking\r\nfast in the wound.\r\n\r\n\"Awful! Awful! How thick the bears are getting to be! Husband says they\r\nhave killed off most all of our hogs.\r\n\r\n\"Your hogs! Just think once, there was a great bear came the other night\r\nand got hold of a hog in Asahel Sprague's hog-pen, and would have killed\r\nhim, if Mr. Sprague hadn't shot the old fellow.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and last summer when Mr. Sperry was gone off to training, there was\r\na bear came in the day time and tackled one of their hogs right in their\r\nown door yard; but Mrs. Sperry and the children screamed so awfully, and\r\ngave him such a tremendous clubbing, he was glad to put off into the woods\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! Ha! She was about up to Jim Parker, who broke a bear's back with a\r\nhand-spike in driving him out of his corn field, just as he was climbing\r\nover the fence.\" [Footnote: Facts which transpired in the early history of\r\nBloomfield. See Turner's History.]\r\n\r\nWolves were equally if not more numerous, destroying in some instances\r\nentire flocks of sheep, so that there was not a farmer in the region who\r\ndid not suffer more or less from their depredations.\r\n\r\nIt was something of an off-set to these annoyances that deer were very\r\nabundant, and furnished the inhabitants with an ample supply of their\r\ndelicious meat. The Indians while assembled here during the council, often\r\nkilled more than a hundred of them in a single day.\r\n\r\nThe object of convening this council was to settle difficulties of long\r\nstanding, and quiet the minds of the Iroquois, who were much disturbed by\r\nthe warlike spirit prevailing at this time among the Indians at the West.\r\nThe influences from this source were of such a nature as to render many\r\namong these friendly tribes exceedingly bold. In some instances on\r\nentering the houses of settlers they would manifest a very haughty temper,\r\nand rudely demand a supply of their wants as though they were still\r\nproprietors and lords of the soil, and the settlers only their servants or\r\ntenants.\r\n\r\nThe settlers themselves began to feel unpleasantly about their position.\r\nDuring the spring of this same year while Thomas Morris was painting his\r\nhouse, erected the previous summer, and making other improvements around\r\nit, indicating his design of having a permanent and inviting home, it so\r\nhappened that a company of settlers in passing by, paused to view with\r\nastonishment what was going on. From a feeling of insecurity they had just\r\nabandoned their new locations in this region, and had come thus far on\r\ntheir way, having resolved to return to the more safe and quiet homes they\r\nhad left at the east. But beholding the enterprise of Mr. Morris, and the\r\nbusiness and thrift that prevailed here on every side, they inferred that\r\ntheir situation could not be so very precarious, and wisely concluded to\r\nreturn and carry forward the improvements commenced by themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Indian council, held during the months of October and November, had\r\nbeen appointed before the victory of General Wayne, noticed in the\r\npreceding chapter, had transpired. This had much to do in giving a\r\nfavorable turn to the proceedings, and of securing those pacific relations\r\nwith the Iroquois, that were then established. Before this these tribes\r\nand the Indians generally were stimulated with the idea that they might\r\nform and maintain in the North-west an independent nationality, that would\r\nreflect once more the pride and glory of the ancient dominion of the\r\nIroquois. But when the news of this signal victory was circulated among\r\nthem, their spirits were humbled and broken. They seemed to relinquish\r\nthis dream of greatness, and gave themselves up to the stern demands of an\r\nevident necessity. This sad intelligence, however, did not reach them\r\nuntil the council had been for several days in progress. Its first opening\r\nwas darkened by no cloud of evil. There was nothing to hinder the exercise\r\nof that proud bearing with which their past greatness, and a hopeful\r\nfuture inspired them.\r\n\r\nThey began to assemble by the arrival of the Oneidas on the eleventh of\r\nOctober. The Onondagas, Cayugas, and a part of the Senecas, led by\r\nFarmer's Brother, came in on the fourteenth. Cornplanter at the head of\r\nthe Allegany clan of Senecas arrived on the sixteenth, and Red Jacket with\r\nhis, on the eighteenth.\r\n\r\nOn assembling, a degree of dignity and decorum was manifested, which\r\nserved to indicate their ideas of the forms and proprieties due to the\r\noccasion. Before reaching the council fire the chiefs and warriors halted,\r\ncarefully decorated themselves after their manner, and then marched to\r\nmeet those appointed to confer with them on the part of the government,\r\nand after passing around and encircling them, with the train, the leader\r\nstepped forth, formally announced their arrival in obedience to the\r\nsummons they had received, at the same time delivering the belt brought by\r\nthe messenger sent to call them together.\r\n\r\nThe next tribe that came, halted and prepared themselves as the others,\r\nwere received by the tribe or tribes already on the ground, who also\r\narrayed themselves in their uniform, and having received their welcome,\r\nsalutes being fired and returned, they marched all together and formed in\r\na circle around the commissioners, when the same ceremony was observed, as\r\nbefore, of delivering the belt. They proceeded thus until all the Indians\r\nhad assembled to the number of about sixteen hundred.\r\n\r\nIt was an occasion for the display of Indian pageantry, and though it may\r\nhave been more rude than among nations calling themselves civilized, it\r\nwas the same in its essential elements, and this council was ushered in\r\nwith as true a military spirit as though banners had been flying, bayonets\r\ngleaming, and soldiers marching to the liveliest, or most heart-stirring\r\nsounds of music.\r\n\r\nThe uniform of the Indian was not as the dress of the European,\r\nornamented, epauletted, tinselled; it was a more simple, less expensive,\r\nbut not a less time honored mode of adorning his person. Though his\r\nmilitary coat was of paint of different colors with which he was striped\r\nin a distinguishing manner, he regarded it no doubt as gorgeous and gay.\r\nInstead of the gracefully waving plume he was bedecked with the feathers\r\nof the kingly eagle; beads and shells served in the place of military\r\nbuttons; and his trophies in the chase, and in war, he regarded as forming\r\na prouder sash than the richest scarf of scarlet or of blue.\r\n\r\nCanandaigua, in years gone by, has often witnessed scenes of proud\r\nmilitary display. But never will there be witnessed so grotesque, and in\r\nmany respects so imposing a parade as appeared on this occasion. The\r\nneighboring forest swarmed with life, and resounded with the wild yell and\r\ndeafening war-whoop of the Indian. It was his gala day, and highly fitting\r\nthat before surrendering these grounds forever to the dominion and usages\r\nof another race, he should come forth once more from his native wilds, and\r\ndepart in the fullness of his strength, as the sun passing from under a\r\ncloud, sheds his full glory over the earth before sinking beneath the\r\nwestern horizon. This was his last day of pride on ground hallowed in the\r\nmemories of the past.\r\n\r\nThe occasion called forth an unusual attendance. It was known that Colonel\r\nPickering who had been appointed to hold this treaty, would come prepared\r\nto give them a grand feast, and distribute among them a large amount of\r\nmoney and of clothing. Hence they all came. \"For weeks before the treaty,\r\nthey were arriving in squads from all their villages, and constructing\r\ntheir camps in the woods, upon the lake shore, and around the court-house\r\nsquare. The little village of whites was invested, overrun with the wild\r\nnatives. It seemed as if they had deserted all their villages, and\r\ntransferred even their old men, women and children to the feast, the\r\ncarousal, and the place of gifts. The night scenes were wild and\r\npicturesque; their camp fires lighting up the forest, and their whoops and\r\nyells creating a sensation of novelty not unmingled with fear, with the\r\nfar inferior in numbers who composed the citizens of the pioneer village\r\nand the sojourners of their own race.\" [Footnote: History of the Phelps\r\nand Gorham Purchase.]\r\n\r\nThe council was formally opened on the eighteenth of October, by a speech\r\nof condolence on the part of the Oneidas and Onondagas, to the Senecas,\r\nCayugas, Tuscaroras and Delawares, some of whom were present, on account\r\nof the death of a number of their chiefs since the last meeting.--It was\r\nwith a view to \"_wipe away their tears,--brighten their faces, and clear\r\ntheir throats_,\"--that they might speak freely at the council fire.\r\n\r\nRed Jacket in reply made a very sympathetic, and as it was regarded at the\r\ntime, beautiful address, presenting belts and strings of wampum to\r\n\"_unite each to the other as the heart of one man_.\"\r\n\r\nNext was given a speech of congratulation by Colonel Pickering, who\r\nappointed a council of condolence on the following Monday for the\r\nDelawares, who were mourning for a young brother killed by a white man.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of burying the dead,--covering the grave with leaves to\r\nobscure it from sight,--of burying the hatchet taken from the head of the\r\nvictim, thus representing his death by violence,--of covering it with\r\nstones and pulling up and planting over it a pine tree, so that in after\r\nyears it should never be disturbed; of wiping the blood from the head of\r\nthe victim, and tears from the eyes of the mourners,--these things\r\nrepresented by speech and action having been performed, the council was\r\nopened in earnest on the day following.\r\n\r\nIn reply to Colonel Pickering's remarks of the preceding day respecting\r\npeace, and upon keeping the chain of friendship bright, Fish Carrier, an\r\naged and influential chief, in a speech of some length recounted the\r\nhistory of the whites and of their intercourse with the red men from their\r\nfirst settlement in this country. He referred to the manner in which they\r\nhad been received, to the friendship, that had existed before the\r\ncontroversy of the United States with Great Britain, and to the\r\nnegotiations that had taken place since that time, the grievances they had\r\nsuffered, dwelling particularly upon the dissatisfaction still existing\r\namong them about the treaty at Fort Stanwix in 1784. \"The commissioners\r\nwere too grasping, they demanded of us too much.\" But as they had taken\r\nhold of the chain of friendship with the fifteen fires they were disposed\r\nto hold fast; but he thought it needed brightening up a little.\r\n\r\nColonel Pickering in reply to them said they ought not to think very hard\r\nof them about that treaty, for they had just come out of a long and bloody\r\nwar, and as they had been victorious the Six Nations ought not to blame\r\nthem for feeling a little proud; and they ought not to be surprised, in\r\nview of what had taken place during the war, if the commissioners were\r\nsomewhat severe.\r\n\r\nA deputation from the Quakers was present at this council, and their\r\naddress being read and interpreted, was received by the Indians with much\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the council the next day, a request was presented by\r\nsome of the Indian women, who desired that their views might be heard; and\r\npermission being granted, Red Jacket spake in their behalf.\r\n\r\nHe represented that the women had taken a deep interest in everything\r\npertaining to the wellfare of their nation; and he requested the sachems\r\nand warriors, as well as the commissioner, to give an attentive\r\nconsideration to the views of those he had been chosen to represent. They\r\nhad attended upon the council, had listened to all that had been said, and\r\nthey desired it to be understood that their views were in accordance with\r\nthose of their sachems and chiefs. They felt that the white people had\r\ncaused them a great deal of suffering. The white people had pressed and\r\nsqueezed them together until their hearts were greatly pained, and they\r\nthought the white people ought to give back all their lands. A white woman\r\nhad told the Indians to repent; [Footnote: Referring to Jemima Wilkinson.]\r\nthey wished in turn to call upon the white people to repent; they needed\r\nto repent as much as the Indians; and they hoped the white people would\r\nrepent and not wrong the Indians any more.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner thanked them for their speech, saying he had a high\r\nrespect for the women, and would be happy to hear from them whenever they\r\nhad anything to say.\r\n\r\nAfter several days had passed without coming to anything decisive in\r\nregard to the main object of the council; Colonel Pickering called their\r\nattention to the fact of their grievances, saying they had been together\r\nsometime and talked them over and had found but two rusty places in the\r\nchain of friendship, one of which they had already brightened. But the\r\nother spot they thought was too deep to be cleared up. It related to their\r\nlands. He then showed them maps which clearly pointed out the limits\r\nagreed upon in their treaties, and by a distinct statement of the\r\nnegotiations and treaties that had been made at different times with them,\r\nand afterward confirmed, proving that the claims of the United States were\r\njust, he declared himself ready to stipulate concerning their grievances,\r\nthat they should still have the privilege of hunting upon the lands they\r\nhad ceded, and that their settlements thereon should remain undisturbed.\r\nHe further assured them that the United States would increase their\r\nannuity from fifteen hundred to four thousand five hundred dollars, to say\r\nnothing about the presents he had brought them amounting to ten thousand\r\ndollars. These he would distribute in case of a favorable termination of\r\ntheir council. He hoped in view of these liberal offers they would dismiss\r\ntheir complaints, bury the hatchet deep and take hold of the chain of\r\nfriendship so firmly as never again to have it torn from their grasp.\r\n\r\nThe Indians appeared to be pleased with these offers, and promising to\r\nregard them favorably, spent several days in deliberating among\r\nthemselves, inviting to their councils the Quakers, a deputation of whom,\r\nas we remarked were present. William Savary, one of their number made the\r\nfollowing interesting note of his observations at the time.--\r\n\r\n\"Oct. 30. After dinner John Parrish and myself rode to view the Farmer's\r\nBrother's encampment which contained about five hundred Indians. They are\r\nlocated by the side of a brook in the woods: having built about seventy or\r\neighty huts, by far the most commodious and ingeniously made of any I have\r\nseen. The principal materials are bark, and boughs of trees, so nicely put\r\ntogether as to keep the family dry and warm. The women as well as the men\r\nappeared to be mostly employed. In this camp there are a large number of\r\npretty children, who in all the activity and buoyancy of health, were\r\ndiverting themselves according to their fancy. The vast number of deer\r\nthey have killed, since coming here, which they cut up and hang round\r\ntheir huts inside and out to dry, together with the rations of beef, which\r\nthey draw daily, give the appearance of plenty to supply the few wants to\r\nwhich they are subjected. The ease and cheerfulness of every countenance,\r\nand the delightfulness of the afternoon, which the inhabitants of the\r\nwoods seemed to enjoy with a relish far superior to those who are pent up\r\nin crowded and populous cities, all combined to make this the most\r\npleasant visit I have yet made to the Indians; and induced me to believe\r\nthat before they became acquainted with the white people, and were\r\ninfected with their vices, they must have been as happy a people as any in\r\nthe world. In returning to our quarters we passed by the Indian council,\r\nwhere Red Jacket was displaying his oratory to his brother chiefs on the\r\nsubject of Colonel Pickering's proposals.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Savary again observes:--\"Red Jacket visited us with his wife and five\r\nchildren, whom he had brought to see us. They were exceedingly well clad,\r\nin their manner, and the best behaved and prettiest Indian children I have\r\never met with.\" [Footnote: As quoted by Col. Stone.]\r\n\r\nVarious councils and deliberations with the Indians, resulted finally in\r\nthe conclusion of a treaty, which was quite satisfactory to all the\r\nparties.--By this treaty peace was again declared to be firmly\r\nestablished, the different tribes were confirmed in their reservations,\r\nand lands that had not been sold, the boundaries of which were accurately\r\ndescribed, and the United States engaged never to claim these lands, or\r\ndisturb the Six Nations in the free use and enjoyment of them. The Six\r\nNations pledged themselves also not to claim any other lands within the\r\nboundaries of the United States, nor disturb the people of the United\r\nStates in the free use and enjoyment thereof. It was stipulated also that\r\nthe United States should have the right of way for a public road from Fort\r\nSchlosser to Lake Erie, have a free passage through their lands, and the\r\nfree use of harbors and rivers adjoining and within their respective\r\ntracts of land, for the passing and securing of vessels and boats, and\r\nliberty to land their cargoes, where necessary for their safety.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of these engagements the United States were to deliver\r\nthe presents, and pay the annuity as already intimated in the promise of\r\nColonel Pickering.--The money thus pledged was to be expended yearly\r\nforever in purchasing clothing, domestic animals, implements of husbandry,\r\nand other utensils suited to their circumstances, and for compensating\r\nuseful artificers who might be employed for their benefit.\r\n\r\nIt was further agreed that for injuries done by individuals on either\r\nside, private revenge should not take place, but that complaint be made by\r\nthe injured party to the nation to which the offender belonged, and that\r\nsuch measures were then to be pursued as should be necessary for the\r\npreservation of peace and friendship. [Footnote: Indian Treaties. Favored\r\nwith a copy by O. Parrish. Esq., of Canandaigua, N. Y.]\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of this treaty was regarded as a great point gained.\r\nPrevious to this time, such of the Iroquois as remained in their ancient\r\nseats, were but partially reconciled to the United States, and were\r\noscilating in their friendship. But henceforth they were uniformly\r\nsteadfast in the allegiance they had promised.\r\n\r\nThe holding of this council was further useful in withdrawing the\r\nattention of this large body of Indians with their warriors, who had been\r\nearnestly solicited to join their hostile brethren at the West.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the council there were several speeches made, but\r\nas they are not of special interest or importance they have not been\r\ngiven. Colonel Stone mentions an evening when quite a number of the chiefs\r\ndined with Colonel Pickering. He says,--\"Much good humor prevailed on this\r\noccasion. The Indians laid aside their stoicism, indulged in many\r\nrepartees, and manifested the keenest relish for wit and humor. Red\r\nJacket, in particular, was conspicuous for the readiness and brilliance of\r\nhis sallies.\" [Footnote: Col. Stone's Life and Times of Red Jacket.]\r\n\r\nNot far from this time, and with reference it is believed to this treaty,\r\nThomas Morris says,--\"Red Jacket was, I suppose, at that time about thirty\r\nor thirty-five years of age, of middle height, well formed, with an\r\nintelligent countenance, and a fine eye; and was in all respects a fine\r\nlooking man. He was the most graceful public speaker I have ever known;\r\nhis manner was most dignified and easy. He was fluent, and at times witty\r\nand sarcastic. He was quick and ready at reply. He pitted himself against\r\nColonel Pickering, whom he sometimes foiled in argument. The colonel would\r\nsometimes become irritated and lose his temper; then Red Jacket would be\r\ndelighted and show his dexterity in taking advantage of any unguarded\r\nassertion of the colonel's. He felt a conscious pride in the conviction\r\nthat nature had done more for him, than for his antagonist.\"\r\n\r\n\"A year or two after this treaty, when Colonel Pickering from post master\r\ngeneral, became secretary of war, I informed Red Jacket of his promotion.\r\n--'Ah!' said he,--'We began our public career about the same time; he knew\r\nhow to read and write; I did not, and he has got ahead of me.--If I had\r\nknown how to read and write I _should have got ahead of him_.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nValley of the Genesee--Indian misgivings--Mill yard--Effort to obtain\r\ntheir land--Council at Big Tree--Coming of the Wadsworths--Indian villages\r\n--Refusal to sell--Discussion between Red Jacket and Thomas Morris--\r\nBreaking up of the Council.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Genesee was a favorite resort of the Indian. His trail\r\nled along its banks and brought him at short intervals to Indian villages,\r\nor the head-quarters of Indian chiefs. Its flats were broad and beautiful,\r\nand were bordered on either side by hills that rose gradually to their\r\nsummit, where they stretched out into extensive table lands. These hills,\r\nas we ascend the valley gradually become higher and higher, until we are\r\nbrought into the vicinity of mountain elevations, where the scenery\r\nbecomes very romantic, and the country much broken. The valley itself is\r\nalmost of uniform width from its commencement, a few miles south of the\r\ncity of Rochester, to the pleasant and thriving village of Mount Morris.\r\nHere these flats which are quite extensive and exceedingly rich and\r\nbeautiful, appear to leave the river and follow its tributary, the\r\nCanaseraga, to a point about sixteen miles above; diminishing somewhat in\r\nwidth as they ascend, until they come near the present village of\r\nDansville, where the hills again recede and forming a large basin, enclose\r\nit on the south, presenting the appearance of a magnificent amphitheater.\r\n\r\nThe Canaseraga is here joined by two streams, Stony Brook and Mill Creek,\r\nwhich flow down from the highlands beyond, over precipices, and through\r\ngorges deep and wild, where rugged cliffs defying all attempts at culture,\r\nrise abruptly at times, from one to three hundred feet on either side. The\r\nIndian's trail conducted him to these wilds, which still remain the most\r\nunchanged of all his ancient haunts. Here are solitudes seldom visited by\r\nman, where are treasured sublimities that enchain the mind, and inspire a\r\nfeeling of devotion in the heart of the beholder. Here the Indian,\r\nundisturbed by other sights or sounds, may yet listen to the voice of the\r\nwaterfall as it sounded in the ear of his fathers, or to the gentle murmur\r\nof the stream discoursing now, as it did to them, in passing hurriedly\r\nover its rocky bed. [Footnote: Who would ever suspect that a railroad\r\nwould stride across any of these deep chasms? How presumptuous.]\r\n\r\nBeyond this point the Canaseraga itself, as it flows from its source among\r\nthe hills bordering on Pennsylvania, passes often through deep ravines,\r\nnarrow defiles, and overhanging cliffs. The same is true also of the\r\nGenesee river above Mount Morris. Its course is marked by scenery rarely\r\nsurpassed in sublimity and grandeur. [Footnote: The High Banks, as they\r\nare called, near Mt. Morris, and a similar formation, together with the\r\nfalls, near Portage, have attracted the attention, and are often visited\r\nby the tourist.--J. N. H.]\r\n\r\nThe Indian as he followed his trail leading up along its banks, paused\r\noften to listen to the thunder of its waterfalls, or to watch its course\r\nwhile threading its way at the bottom of ravines, hundreds of feet beneath\r\nthe jutting point where he was standing. The territory marked by this\r\nriver was unsurpassed in the magnificence and beauty of its scenery, and\r\nin the variety and richness of its soil; and the Indian who lived for the\r\nmost part in the open world, found here a home congenial to his spirit,\r\nand he loved it. The white man saw and loved it too. But he loved it not\r\nas the Indian, who looked upon it as already complete. The hills brought\r\nhim venison, the valleys corn, and the streams on every side abounded in\r\nfish, the beautiful speckled trout, which fairly swarmed in all of these\r\nwaters. What could he want more? He loved it as it was; just as it came\r\nfrom the forming hand of the Great Spirit.\r\n\r\nThe white man loved it for what he saw he could make of it; but how little\r\nhe thought his making, would mar the desirableness and beauty of the\r\nIndian's home. He had already obtained of the Indian a title to all his\r\nland lying on the east side of this river. He had even been allowed to\r\ncross over to the west side, and look upon that generous _Mill Yard_,\r\ntwelve miles square, as his own. A very extensive gift it is true, but as\r\nit was proposed to erect at the Genesee falls a saw mill, which was\r\nclaimed to be a vastly benevolent institution, and would be useful to the\r\nIndians as well as whites, inasmuch as it would save the immense labor of\r\nsplitting and hewing logs for plank, as they were going to make the water\r\nof the river split the logs and hew them at the same time; it was claimed\r\nthat this surrender on the part of the Indians, would be but a just offset\r\nagainst the self-denial, great expense, and severe labor of the whites, in\r\nestablishing so benign an institution as a _saw mill_, in these western\r\nwilds. This is one among many instances of the benevolence of the white\r\nman toward the Indian.\r\n\r\nIf the Genesee country was prized by the Indian, it was regarded with a\r\nwishful eye by the white man. And as he had obtained what was on the east\r\nside of the Genesee river, he was not content without a larger portion on\r\nthe west. Already the tide of emigration had brought him to the utmost\r\nlimit of his possessions, and he could hardly refrain from looking, with a\r\nwishful eye, upon the fertile fields lying beyond.\r\n\r\nThe Indian on the other hand, began to feel uneasy about having sold so\r\nmuch of his land. He regretted very much the permission he had given the\r\nwhite man to own one foot of ground, on the west side of the Genesee\r\nriver. Natural boundaries with him weighed more than with the white man;\r\nand had the white man's possessions been confined strictly to the east\r\nside of the river, he would have felt better satisfied though it had cost\r\nhim a larger area of ground. The white man's mode of running lines and of\r\nmeasuring land, he did not comprehend or appreciate. But when the line was\r\nmade by a creek, river, or mountain, he understood it, and it harmonized\r\nbetter with his views of fitness, in dividing up the surface of this great\r\nearth. He was utterly unschooled in the art of computing by acres and\r\nroods. But the water's edge he had traversed with his light canoe, and\r\nwith every point and islet on the lakes he was familiar. He had followed\r\nthe rivers to where they came bubbling up from their rocky bed amid\r\nmountain elevations, and there was not a tributary stream or run, by whose\r\nside he had not rested, or by whose music he had not been charmed, keeping\r\npace with it, as it went innocently busying and babbling along on its\r\ndownward way. With any or all of these landmarks he was familiar, and when\r\nfixed upon as boundaries, he could readily recur to, and religiously keep\r\nthem; for they had been made by the Great Spirit, and it was his life-\r\nstudy to know them.\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with the large purchase already made, the white man\r\ncontemplated still greater acquisitions of Indian land. Little did the red\r\nman suspect, while roaming unmolested over his native hills, that in\r\ncivilized circles, the advantages and disadvantages of his cherished home\r\nwere canvassed, and made the subject of negotiation and purchase. And it\r\nawakened his deepest surprise when assured, that without his knowledge or\r\nconsent, his land had been sold. He was not aware that his ignorance of\r\nthe value of his country, for the purposes of civilization, was made a\r\nsubject of barter among his superiors in knowledge, and that men of\r\nenterprize were willing to pay for the privilege of making a bargain with\r\nhim for his lands.\r\n\r\nThis right, as we have seen, was claimed by the government; Massachusetts\r\nholding the right of buying the Indian lands in Western New York. This\r\nright, under sanction of which the Phelps and Gorham purchase was made,\r\nwas in part sold, as related in a preceding chapter. The pre-emptive right\r\nto the remainder was bought by Robert Morris in the spring of 1791. He re-\r\nsold soon after, to a company of gentlemen in Holland; pledging himself to\r\nsurvey the entire tract, and extinguish the Indian title. Thirty-five\r\nthousand pounds sterling of the purchase money were retained, as a\r\nguaranty of his fulfilling these engagements.\r\n\r\nIt became an object therefore for Mr. Morris to obtain, at as early a\r\nperiod as practicable, a conference with the Indians, and their consent to\r\nsell this land. Owing to their extreme reluctance to part with any more\r\nland, he had not been able to persuade them to appoint a council for this\r\npurpose, and committed the further prosecution of this to his son Thomas.\r\nHence the occasion given to notice the presence of Thomas Morris at the\r\nIndian councils, particularly that at Tioga Point. For several years he\r\nhad been cultivating an acquaintance with the Indians, residing in their\r\nmidst, attending their councils, and making himself generally agreeable;\r\nand by means of his own personal influence with the chiefs, and unwearied\r\nexertions he gained their permission to hold a council, which assembled at\r\nBig Tree, the present site of Genesee, in August, 1797.\r\n\r\nThis had already become the residence of the white man. James and William\r\nWadsworth, from Durham, Conn., had emigrated hither as early as the year\r\n1790. Under their auspices a new settlement had been commenced. On rising\r\nground which commanded a fine view of the flats, stood their large block\r\nhouse. The same site has still its attractions, for what at a later day,\r\nwas the old Wadsworth mansion.\r\n\r\nThe coming of the Wadsworths into this region, which was still in\r\npossession of the Indians, and their prominence in its subsequent history,\r\nwould seem to justify a more extended notice.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1790, James Wadsworth, then a young man of twenty-two,\r\nwas debating with himself the question of his future calling in life. He\r\nhad graduated at Yale College in the fall of '87:--had spent the winter of\r\n'87 and '88, at Montreal, Canada, teaching school. He had no thought of\r\nteaching as his life-work, and what would he do next? was his earnest\r\ninquiry. Some one suggested that he should study medicine; but this did\r\nnot suit him. As he had received a liberal education, it was further\r\nintimated that he should lead a professional life and become a lawyer, or\r\na minister.\r\n\r\nAfter duly considering the matter, choosing for this purpose the\r\nretirement of a neighboring wood, he returned the answer,--\"I am not\r\nsatisfied with either of these professions.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will you do, then?\" was the inquiry. He replied, \"I know God has\r\nmade me for something, and I am trying to find out what that is.\"\r\n\r\nWith his mind thus unsettled, he determined to visit his uncle, Colonel\r\nJeremiah Wadsworth, of Hartford. This uncle had pursued a sea-faring life,\r\nentering upon it at first for the benefit of his health, and following it\r\nafterward, from a love for the employment. From a sailor before the mast,\r\nhe came to be mate, and captain, and at the breaking out of the\r\nRevolutionary war he had retired from the sea, and had settled at\r\nHartford, Conn. He was appointed commissary of the Connecticut line, and\r\nsubsequently had important trusts committed to his charge, by his own\r\nState, and also by the Congress at Philadelphia, having reference to the\r\npay, clothing and subsistence of the Continental troops.\r\n\r\nIn the discharge of his official duties he had formed an acquaintance with\r\nOliver Phelps; and after Mr. Phelps had secured an interest in the Genesee\r\ncountry, he represented its advantages to Colonel Wadsworth in such\r\nglowing colors, as led him to purchase a considerable tract of land in\r\nthat region. Being a man of wealth and advanced in life, he had no thought\r\nof emigrating thither, but designed to provide for his interests by\r\nemploying an agent.\r\n\r\nAs soon as James Wadsworth arrived at the house, he was met at the door by\r\nhis uncle, who eagerly grasped his hand and exclaimed,--\"James, I am glad\r\nyou have come, you are the very man I have been wanting to see.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not long before they were deeply engaged in discussing the Genesee\r\nquestion, this becoming the chief topic of conversation during the visit.\r\nAs the result, James purchased on advantageous terms a part of the tract\r\nat Big Tree, and became agent for the remaining lands, qualified by the\r\ncondition that his brother William would consent to accompany him in the\r\nproposed emigration. [Footnote: Conversation of the author with Nehemiah\r\nHubbard, Esq., of Middletown, Conn., and statements in Turner's History.]\r\n\r\nThe two brothers jointly entered upon the undertaking, and commenced\r\npreparations for their journey into this, at that time, far-off\r\nwilderness. An ox cart, and ox team, are in wide contrast with the\r\nconveniences of travel enjoyed at present. Yet with these, and two or\r\nthree hired men, and a colored woman, a favorite slave belonging to the\r\nfamily, William set forth to encounter the vicissitudes and dangers\r\ninvolved in the enterprise. It was a slow and wearisome journey, most of\r\nthe way rough, and some of the way requiring to be opened and prepared for\r\ntravel.\r\n\r\nJames, with provisions and a small supply of household furniture, went by\r\nthe sound, the Hudson, and the head of navigation on Canandaigua outlet.\r\nHe arrived at Canandaigua three days in advance of his brother.\r\n\r\nFrom this point their journey was comparatively easy. They pursued the\r\nroute taken by Sullivan in '79, yet not without having frequently to cut a\r\nway for their team and cart. They arrived at their point of destination on\r\nthe 10th of June, 1790.\r\n\r\nCaptain Horatio, and John H. Jones preceded the Wadsworths, and other\r\nfamilies came into the region soon after. But the country was full of\r\nIndians. Their villages swarmed with life in every direction. Ken-de-wah\r\nor Big Tree, as principal chief was at the head of a numerous clan,\r\nlocated on the bluffs near by. Not far from them on the river was a\r\nvillage of the Tuscaroras. Two miles below was Oneida Town, a large\r\nvillage of Oneidas. Near the present site of West Avon was another\r\nprincipal village, whose chief was Ga-kwa-dia, or Hot Bread. Above was\r\nanother large village called Little Beard's Town, occupying the present\r\nsite of Cuylerville. Further on were Allen's Hill, Squaky Hill and\r\nGardeau, the residence of the \"White Woman.\" Her husband was principal\r\nchief of the clan at this point. Further on at Nunda, was another village,\r\nits principal chiefs were Elk Hunter and Green Coat. Still higher up on\r\nthe river at Caneadea, was another considerable village, whose chief was\r\nJohn Hudson. [Footnote: It was here the author's grandfather, as an Indian\r\nprisoner, had to run the gauntlet in the spring of 1782.\r\n\r\nThe author remembers Hudson very well. Often visiting his grandfather's\r\nhouse in Angelica, N. Y. When a boy he often sat on Hudson's knee, whom he\r\nregarded as a very pleasant, kind Indian.]\r\n\r\nThese villages were mostly in the vicinity of Big Tree, a region which at\r\nthat time was not without its charms, and has since been regarded as\r\npossessing attractions in soil and scenery, unsurpassed by any in the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nIt was here the council, solicited by Thomas Morris, assembled.\r\n\r\nThe unfinished block house of the Wadsworths was engaged for the\r\naccommodation of those particularly interested with Mr. Morris in\r\nconducting the council; and a large tent covered with boughs, and prepared\r\nwith rows of seats, and a platform, furnished a place suited to their\r\ndeliberations.\r\n\r\nThe United States, though not directly concerned as a party in this\r\ncouncil, were interested in the welfare of the Indians, and appointed a\r\ncommissioner to watch over their rights, and see that no injustice took\r\nplace. Massachusetts reserved this right in the sale of her pre-emptive\r\ntitle. Accordingly Colonel Wadsworth of Connecticut, appeared as\r\ncommissioner on the part of the United States, and General Wm. Shepard in\r\nbehalf of the commonwealth of Massachusetts. William Bayard of New York\r\nrepresented the interests of the Holland company, and Mr. Morris, appeared\r\nthrough his agents, Thomas Morris and Colonel Williamson. The engagements\r\nof Mr. Williamson calling him away, the responsibility of conducting the\r\ntreaty devolved upon Thomas Morris.\r\n\r\nA large number of Indians were present, brought together by the prospect\r\nof good cheer, no less than their interest in the object of their\r\nassembling.\r\n\r\nThe council being duly opened, the commissioners offered their\r\ncredentials, and explained the reason of their appointment; after which\r\nMr. Morris presented in a speech of some length, the object for which they\r\nhad been convened. Representing the desire of his father to obtain by\r\npurchase a part, or all of their lands, and how much better it would be\r\nfor them to dispose of all, except what were actually needed for\r\nsettlement, and place the money at interest, than to retain in their\r\npossession uncultivated wastes, whose only value to them could be such as\r\nwere derived from the chase; and that this advantage would not be lost,\r\nfor they could still use it for hunting, the same as before. He concluded\r\nby offering them the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, for the entire\r\ntract that remained to them in the State, allowing them such reservations\r\nas might be needed for actual use.\r\n\r\nThe Indians after deliberating for a time returned an unfavorable answer;\r\nsaying \"they did not wish to part with any more of their land.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Morris replied, urging them to reconsider the case, that they ought\r\nnot to decide hastily, setting before them in various ways the favorable\r\nterms he had proposed.\r\n\r\nAfter deliberating once more, they returned the answer they had already\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nMeetings and speeches thereupon succeeded; Farmer's Brother, Cornplanter,\r\nLittle Billy, Little Beard, and Red Jacket, taking part in the discussion,\r\nthe chief burden of which fell upon the latter.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Morris urged upon their attention the liberal sum he had proposed\r\nto pay for their lands:--\r\n\r\nRed Jacket replied,--\"We are not yet convinced that it is best for us to\r\ndispose of them at any price.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Mr. Morris, \"what value can they be to you as they now are,\r\nany further than the consciousness that you own them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Red Jacket, _but this knowledge is everything to us. It\r\nraises us in our own estimation. It creates in our bosoms a proud feeling\r\nwhich elevates us as a nation_. Observe the difference between the\r\nestimation in which a Seneca and an Oneida are held. We are courted, while\r\nthe Oneidas are considered as a degraded people, fit only to make\r\n_brooms_ and _baskets. Why this difference_? It is because the\r\nSenecas are known to be the proprietors of a _broad domain_, while the\r\nOneidas are _cooped up in a narrow space_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said Mr. Morris, \"you presume too much in regard to the consequence\r\nof your nation. It is far from being as great as you seem to suppose; and\r\nin proof of this let me refer you to the manner in which your deputation\r\nto the Miamis was received in 1793. Though large and composed of many of\r\nthe first men of your nation, it had but little influence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true,\" replied Red Jacket, \"_and why_? It was because we were in\r\n_bad company. We went with the pale faces_. Had we gone alone, we\r\nshould have been treated with the _dignity which belongs to the Senecas\r\nthroughout the world_.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Red Jacket was still standing some one interposed the remark,--\r\n\"_he's a coward_.\" Turning round with a look of contempt, and in tone\r\nand manner expressing the deepest sarcasm, he said,--\"YES, I AM A COWARD.\"\r\nAnd then waving his hand over the broad and beautiful lands that were\r\nspread out before them, added: \"_assure me that you can create lands like\r\nthese, which the Great Spirit has made for us his red children, so that\r\nyou can give us lands like them in return, and I will be brave:_ UNTIL\r\nTHEN, I AM A COWARD,--I DARE NOT SELL THESE LANDS.\" [Footnote:\r\nConversation of the author with Wm. Jones.]\r\n\r\nThe commissioners together with the agent of the Holland company, who had\r\nbeen looking on and anxiously observing the proceedings for about two\r\nweeks, began to regard the undertaking as hopeless, and urged Mr. Morris\r\nto use more decisive means with them, and bring them to terms one way or\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nThough contrary to Mr. Morris' convictions from his knowledge of the\r\nIndian character, as to its being the best method to pursue, he yielded to\r\ntheir solicitations; and when the Indians presented him the offer of a\r\nsingle township on the line of Pennsylvania, at one dollar an acre, Red\r\nJacket assuring him that he could sell this at a sufficient advance, to\r\npay for the trouble and expense of the treaty, he told them if that was\r\nall they could offer, they might return to their homes, for the sooner\r\ntheir conference was ended the better.\r\n\r\nRed Jacket thereupon sprang to his feet and said, \"You have now come to\r\nthe point to which I wished to bring you. You told us in your first\r\naddress, that even in the event of our not agreeing to sell our lands, we\r\nwould part friends. Here then is my hand.\" Mr. Morris taking his hand, he\r\nthen added; \"I now cover up the council fire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nInterview between Farmer's Brother and Thomas Morris--Mr. Morris addresses\r\nthe women--Distributes presents--Negotiations continued--Treaty concluded\r\nwith the women and warriors--Manner of payment--Inquiries about a Bank--\r\nTheir reservations--White woman--Young King's dissent--Charge of\r\ninsincerity.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indians appeared to regard the breaking up of the council at Big Tree,\r\nwith great satisfaction. Their joy was unbounded; they made the forest\r\nring with their wild yells, inveighing loudly and insultingly against Mr.\r\nMorris, and the commissioners, and assuming such menacing attitudes, as\r\nfairly to intimidate those unaccustomed to their rude manners.\r\n\r\nTo all present but Mr. Morris, the prospect of accomplishing any thing\r\nafter this seemed utterly hopeless, and it was with some difficulty the\r\ncommissioners were persuaded to remain, for the purpose of giving him the\r\nopportunity of another trial. Yet his hopes of success were so sanguine,\r\nas to induce them to tarry a short time longer.\r\n\r\nThe day after the breaking up of the council, Farmer's Brother called on\r\nMr. Morris, expressed his regret at what had transpired, and the hope that\r\nit might not destroy the interest he had manifested for his nation.\r\n\"Certainly not,\" said Mr. Morris,--\"you had a right to refuse to sell your\r\nlands;\" but he added, the treatment he had received from his people at the\r\nclose of the council, especially in allowing a drunken warrior to menace\r\nand insult him; while they were yelling in approbation of his conduct, was\r\nuncalled for, and ungenerous. He had not deserved this from them. They had\r\nfor years had food at his house in Canandaigua, and liquor as much as was\r\nfor their good, and whenever any of them had been at Philadelphia, his\r\nfather had treated them with equal kindness and hospitality.\r\n\r\nFarmer's Brother acknowledged that all this was true, and regretted that\r\nthe council fire had been extinguished so hastily, or they might have had\r\na meeting, to smooth over these difficulties.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\"--said Mr. Morris, \"and here is another ground of complaint. Red\r\nJacket assumed the right of covering up the fire. This did not belong to\r\nhim. For according to your custom, he only who kindles the council fire,\r\nhas a right to cover it up.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is so,\"--said Farmer's Brother.\r\n\r\n\"Then as I did not cover it up the council fire is still burning.\"\r\n\r\nAfter thinking a moment he replied,--\"_Yes_:\"--and appeared to be\r\npleased that it was so, and proposed to have the council convene again.\r\n\r\nMr. Morris signified his pleasure to delay a few days, to give him time to\r\nlook over his accounts, pay for the provisions that had been consumed,\r\ncollect his cattle that had not been slaughtered, and arrange other\r\nmatters preparatory to his leaving the treaty ground.\r\n\r\nHe had become so well acquainted with Indian customs, that he had resolved\r\nupon another expedient, when his negotiations with the sachems had failed.\r\n\r\nIt is a rule among the Indians that their sachems shall have a right to\r\ntransact whatever business belongs to their nation, whether relating to\r\ntheir lands, or anything else. But in transactions that concern their\r\nlands, if their course is not satisfactory to the women and warriors, they\r\nhave a right to arrest the proceedings, and take the management into their\r\nown hands. The reason they assign for this practice is,--that the land\r\nbelongs to the warriors, because they are the defense and strength of\r\ntheir nation, and to the women, because they are mothers of the warriors.\r\nIn their polity therefore they recognize head or chief women, whose\r\nprivilege it is to select a speaker to represent their views.\r\n\r\nMr. Morris determined as a last resort, to refer his case to the chief\r\nwomen and warriors. He accordingly sought and obtained such a meeting.\r\n\r\nHe made known to them his business, told them of the offer he had made\r\ntheir sachems, portrayed to them in glowing colors, the advantages they\r\nwould receive from the annuity so large a sum would bring,--how it would\r\nfurnish them with food and clothing, without any anxiety or toil on their\r\npart, and that they would thus be relieved of many hardships, which they\r\nwere now compelled to endure.--That the sachems, who were unwilling to\r\nsell the land, always had enough to supply their wants.--That they could\r\nkill game, and feast on the meat, and go to the settlements and sell the\r\nskins, and buy them clothing. Hence they did not care to exchange their\r\nland for money, that would enable the women to obtain for themselves and\r\nchildren food and clothing, whereas they were now often compelled to go\r\nhungry and naked. By selling such a portion of their land as they had no\r\nuse for, they would have the means of supplying their necessary wants, and\r\nof making themselves comfortable. He then displayed before them a large\r\nsupply of beads, blankets, silver brooches, and various other ornaments,\r\nof which the natives were particularly fond, and said he had brought these\r\nwith the design of making them presents, in the event of a successful\r\ntreaty. But in as much as the women were not to blame for breaking off the\r\nnegotiations, he was determined they should have the presents he had\r\nintended for them. He accordingly proceeded to distribute among sparkling\r\neyes, and joyous hearts, the beauties and treasures, he had brought for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThese gifts proved a most powerful addition to his argument, and were the\r\nmeans of giving a favorable turn to their counsels. For several days after\r\nthis the chiefs, and women, and warriors, could be seen scattered about\r\nhere and there in small parties, engaged in earnest conversation, which\r\nresulted in a renewal of their negotiations.\r\n\r\nMr. Morris was informed that their council fire was still burning, and\r\nthat their business might proceed,--but instead of being carried on by the\r\nsachems, would be conducted by the women and warriors.\r\n\r\nCornplanter being the principal war-chief, appeared on this occasion in\r\ntheir behalf.\r\n\r\nHe said,--\"They had seen with regret the misconduct of the sachems; that\r\nthey thought also the action of Mr. Morris was too hasty; but still they\r\nwere willing the negotiations should be renewed; and hoped they would be\r\nconducted with better temper on both sides.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Morris offered a few conciliatory remarks in reply; and Farmer's\r\nBrother, on the part of the sachems, represented these proceedings of the\r\nwomen and warriors, as in accordance with the customs of their nation.\r\n\r\nThe way being thus opened, the negotiations were readily carried forward\r\nto a successful termination.\r\n\r\nThey consented to sell their lands for the sum proposed, which was one\r\nhundred thousand dollars, leaving their reservations to be settled, as\r\nthey could agree.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of the Indian character was apparent, in the eagerness with\r\nwhich they desired to know about a _Bank:_ the president having\r\ndirected that the money they received for their lands, in case they were\r\nsold, should be invested for their benefit in stock of the United States\r\nBank; in the name of the president, and his successors in office, as\r\ntrustees of the Indians; they earnestly inquired,--_what is a Bank_?\r\n\r\nSeveral attempts were made at explanation, when finally they came to\r\nunderstand, that the United States Bank, at Philadelphia, was a large\r\nplace where their money would be planted, and where it would grow, like\r\ncorn in the field.\r\n\r\nAs it was desirable also for them to understand, that the dividends from\r\nit might be greater some years than others, this was explained by\r\nreferring to the idea of planting, as they could know from experience,\r\nthat some years they would have from the same ground a better crop than\r\nothers. Hence after this when speaking to Mr. Morris about their money,\r\nthey would inquire _what kind of a crop they were going to have that\r\nyear_?\r\n\r\nAnother point of interest with them, was to ascertain _how large a pile,\r\nthe money they were to receive, would make_?\r\n\r\nThis was shown them by representing the number of kegs of a given size, it\r\nwould take to hold, and the number of horses that would be necessary to\r\ndraw it.\r\n\r\nThese questions being settled, the next point to be agreed upon, was the\r\nsize of their reservations. Mr. Morris had stipulated, in case their\r\ndemands were reasonable, no deduction would be made from the price they\r\nwere to receive. But instead of moderate, very exhorbitant claims were\r\npresented, growing out of a degree of rivalry between different chiefs.\r\n\r\nTheir comparative importance would be graduated in a measure by the size\r\nof their domain, and the number of people they would thus be enabled to\r\nhave about them; hence they were individually ambitious of not being out-\r\ndone, in the size of their reservations.\r\n\r\nRed Jacket put in a claim to about one-fourth of the entire tract\r\npurchased. Cornplanter desired about as much; and other chiefs were alike\r\nambitious in securing extensive reservations; and they wished to have them\r\nmarked out by natural boundaries, such as rivers, hills or the course of\r\nstreams. To all of these demands Mr. Morris was obliged to give a stout\r\nand resolute denial, requiring them to fix upon a certain number of square\r\nmiles, which, in the aggregate, should not be far from three hundred and\r\nfifty.\r\n\r\nHere also arose difficulties about the size of their respective\r\nallotments, which they were unable to settle, so that Mr. Morris was\r\nobliged to assume the office of arbiter, and decide these for them, which\r\nhe accomplished generally to their satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIn only one instance did he depart from his purpose of not allowing\r\nnatural boundaries, in describing their reservations. It was in case of\r\nMary Jemison, the White Woman, who lived on the Genesee river, some few\r\nmiles above Mt. Morris. Her history is one of singular interest, and as\r\nbelonging to this region, and connected with the circumstances under\r\nconsideration, a brief notice of this remarkable woman, will not be out of\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nHers is an instance of the entire change that may be wrought, in the taste\r\nand inclination, so that instead of a civilized, a person may prefer an\r\nuncultivated state of society. Though descended from the whites, she\r\nbecame so thoroughly Indian in her feelings and habits, that she was\r\nregarded as a curiosity, and called by way of distinction--the \"_White\r\nWoman_.\"\r\n\r\nShe was born on the ocean, while her parents were emigrating from Ireland\r\nto this country, about the year 1742 or 3. Her father and mother soon\r\nafter landing at Philadelphia, removed to a frontier settlement of\r\nPennsylvania, lying on what was called Marsh Creek. During the war between\r\nthe French and English, she was taken captive with her parents, by a party\r\nof Shawnee Indians. On the way, her father and mother were killed. The\r\nmother anticipating, from tokens she had observed, what would be their\r\nfate, advised her child not to attempt an escape from the Indians, as she\r\nmost likely would be taken again, and treated worse. But as a course\r\nbetter adapted to promote her welfare, she was told to try and please her\r\ncaptors, adding as her parting counsel,--\"don't forget, my daughter, the\r\nprayers I have taught you,--repeat them often; be a good child, and may\r\nGod bless you.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this, under various trials she went with the party, until they came\r\nto Fort Du Quesne. [Footnote: Afterwards called Fort Pitt, now the site of\r\nPittsburg.] Here she was given to two Indian women, who were of the Seneca\r\nnation, and lived eighty miles below, on the Ohio river, at a place called\r\nShe-nan-jee. With the usual ceremony observed by the Indians on such\r\noccasions, she was adopted into their family, and called De-ha-wa-mis. At\r\nlength under kind treatment she began to feel as one of them. In time she\r\nwas married to a young chief of the Delaware tribe, with whom she lived\r\nhappily for several years in the Shawnee country. She became devotedly\r\nattached to her Indian husband, who treated her with marked tokens of\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nAfter a time she welcomed with the joy of a young mother's heart, the\r\nappearance in her wigwam of a daughter, her first born. The bright morning\r\nof her domestic joy was soon overcast with sorrow; she is seen strewing\r\nover her little one's grave, the fallen leaves of autumn. She-nin-jee, her\r\nIndian husband once more became a father. Together they gladly embraced a\r\nson. Their lonely cabin after this was enlivened and cheered by his\r\nchildish prattle; nothing now remained to interrupt the joy of the mother,\r\nbut the absence of the father, whom the season of hunting, took far away\r\nfrom his cherished home. Yet with returning spring these toils are\r\nforgotten, as he is surrounded once more with the charms of the domestic\r\nfireside. But at length there came a spring whose joyful return, brought\r\nnot the long wished for She-nin-jee, back to his lonely cabin. Many an\r\nevening fire blazed brightly to bid him welcome, yet he did not come.\r\nChoice venison had been dried and laid up for him, new skins had been\r\nprepared and spread for his couch, and many a silent hour whiled away with\r\nthoughts of the absent one, but he came not. His returning comrades\r\nbrought back the sad news of his death. De-ha-wa-mis mourned long and\r\ndeeply for the pride of her Indian wigwam. Her own kindred could not have\r\nextended to her more genuine sympathy, than did her new relatives by\r\nadoption. They kindly offered to take her back, if she desired to go, to\r\nher former friends among the whites, or if she chose to remain among them,\r\nthey promised to give her a home of her own.\r\n\r\nA part of her Indian relatives lived in the valley of the Genesee, and\r\nthis was the occasion of her removal there, from her home on the Ohio. A\r\nfew years intervened, and she again became the wife of an Indian, the\r\ndistinguished Seneca warrior Hio-ka-too. She resided with him until his\r\ndeath, at Gardeau, the place where she was living, at the time of her\r\nappearance at this treaty. The chiefs desired for her a special\r\nreservation. To this Mr. Morris readily assented, in case she would\r\nspecify a certain number of acres.\r\n\r\nShe said to him,--\"I do not know any thing about acres, but I have some\r\nimproved places;\" pointing them out on the ground; \"here a patch of\r\npotatoes, there, a few beans, and another still, where there's a little\r\ncorn.\" She wished these might be embraced in her reservation, at the same\r\ntime giving boundaries, which she thought would include them.\r\n\r\nMr. Morris owing to the lateness of the hour, and the impatience of the\r\ncommissioners, gave his consent to the boundary named, supposing it might\r\ninclude a hundred or a hundred and fifty acres. But much to his surprise,\r\nthe tract when surveyed, was found to contain not less than seventeen\r\nthousand, nine hundred and twenty-seven acres. [Footnote: Indian Treaties,\r\np. 39. This reservation has been variously represented to contain, four\r\nthousand, and by others a larger number of acres. Col. Stone makes it\r\nthirty thousand. The amount given in the text is that obtained by actual\r\nsurvey of the boundaries in question. They are as follows: \"Beginning at\r\nthe mouth of Steep Hill Creek, thence due east until it strikes the Old\r\nPath, thence south until a due west line will intersect with certain steep\r\nrocks on the west side of the Genesee river, thence extending due west,\r\ndue north, and due east, until it strikes the first mentioned bound,\r\nenclosing as much land on the west side, as on the east side of the\r\nriver.\"\r\n\r\nThe survey by Augustus Porter, surveyor, gives it 17,927.]\r\n\r\nMary Jemison, the White Woman, had thus secured to her, according to the\r\npledge of the Indians to give her a home, a princely domain, where for\r\nyears after in primitive simplicity, she planted her beans, potatoes and\r\ncorn, and maintained, as in former years, the usages of her Indian life.\r\n\r\nThe most of this tract she afterward sold to John Grey and Henry B. Gibson\r\nof Canandaigua; a deed for which was executed bearing date of September\r\n3d, 1823.\r\n\r\nShe retained for her own use twelve hundred and eighty acres, and received\r\nfor the balance, the sum of four thousand two hundred and eighty-six\r\ndollars, or an annuity of three hundred dollars forever.\r\n\r\nThe Senecas became gradually dispossessed of their lands in the valley of\r\nthe Genesee, and in the year 1825, removed to their reservation at\r\nBuffalo. At the time of their removal, the White Woman refused to part\r\nwith the residue of her land, and continued to reside at the place, where\r\nshe had passed the greater part of her long life, and which was now\r\nendeared to her by many associations in the past.\r\n\r\nBut here she soon found herself surrounded by another race, and as time\r\nadvanced, she longed to be among the people she had chosen for her\r\nkindred, and disposing of her possessions in the Genesee valley, removed\r\nto Buffalo in 1831.\r\n\r\nShe had now upon her the infirmities of age. Long had the parting\r\ninjunction of her christian mother passed from memory. The religion as\r\nwell as habits of the Indian, had become hers. Ninety summers had passed\r\nover her head. The missionary had visited her, and had been assured that\r\nher faith had long been in accord with that of the red man, and she had no\r\ndesire to change her religious views.\r\n\r\nBut ere her last hour came a voice reached her from the distant past. It\r\nawakened memories long forgotten. She sent for the missionary. He came and\r\nstood by her. She was almost withered away. Her small, shrivelled, finely\r\nwrinkled face, silvery hair, toothless mouth, the nose almost touching her\r\nchin, and her thin, wasted form, indicated the presence of second\r\nchildhood. The memory of that long lost mother rushed back upon her mind.\r\nShe cried out in anguish, as well as sincerity of heart, \"Oh, God! have\r\nmercy upon me!\" The prayer of her childhood returned; she instinctively\r\nbegan to say.--\"_Our Father which art in heaven._\"\r\n\r\nAs a child she received the instructions of the missionary, and before\r\ndeparting this life, her soul was lighted up with a cheering hope, based\r\nupon a reception of the clear and living truths of Christianity.\r\n\r\nNo one had sought to disturb the serenity of her advanced life, by\r\nintruding upon her the idea that she was a sinner. How came she to be thus\r\nexercised? The lessons given in childhood, availed more than sermons, and\r\nimpressions were then made, which though apparently effaced, still\r\nremained to be quickened into life, and bring forth fruit, which cheered\r\nthe closing days of her singularly eventful history.\r\n\r\nWith the settlement of the White Woman's reservation, Mr. Morris regarded\r\nthe business of the treaty, as about concluded. Yet a new obstacle was\r\npresented by the arrival of Young King, a descendant of \"Old Smoke,\" a\r\nrenowned chief, held in great veneration among the Senecas. None had ever\r\nattained a greater degree of power, or swayed a more commanding influence.\r\nThe son though not possessing the high endowments of the father, yet when\r\nhe chose to exert it, commanded an extensive hereditary influence, which\r\ncarried with it great weight. Having been informed of the proceedings of\r\nthe council thus far, he expressed his disapproval.\r\n\r\nCornplanter and Farmer's Brother informed Mr. Morris that the treaty could\r\nnot be completed contrary to the wishes of Young King; that however\r\nunreasonable it might appear to him, for one man to defeat the will of the\r\nentire nation, it was a power he received from his birth, and one of which\r\nhe could not be deprived. Yet after much persuasion, Young King, though\r\nnot reconciled to the idea of selling their lands, acquiesced; saying--\"he\r\nwould not stand out against the wishes of his nation.\"\r\n\r\nThe signing of the treaty yet remained; and Red Jacket according to the\r\ntestimony of Mr. Morris, though he had strenuously resisted the sale,\r\ndesired nevertheless to have his name appear among the chiefs of his\r\nnation, whose signatures were appended to the deed executed on the 15th of\r\nSeptember, 1797, conveying to Robert Morris of Philadelphia, the title to\r\nall their lands west of the Genesee river, not included in their\r\nreservations, or previously sold.\r\n\r\nFrom this fact the inference has been derived, that the orator was\r\n_insincere_ in his opposition to the sales made of his people's lands.\r\nHis sincerity though questioned now, was never after this a matter of\r\ndoubt. If he had been insincere before, the effect of this sale on the\r\ndestiny of his people, imposed upon him considerations of so grave a\r\nnature, as to render the idea of his indifference extremely improbable,\r\nand no one after this ever thought of imputing to him such a motive. Yet\r\nin all the sales the Senecas made of their land, subsequent to this\r\nperiod, Red Jacket's name, however much he may have resisted the act, was\r\nappended to the deed or instrument of conveyance. The reason he assigned\r\nfor this, was his desire to have his name go, whether for better or worse,\r\nwith the destinies of his people. Having exerted all his energies to\r\nprevent the sale of their lands, he felt that his duty had been\r\ndischarged. And when his people decided against him, he regarded the\r\nresponsibility of the transaction as resting on those who had effected it,\r\nand whether he gave or witheld his name, it would have no influence in\r\ndetermining the result.\r\n\r\nHe may have had some pride also in having his name appended to a document,\r\nwhich he knew the white people regarded, as of much importance, and were\r\nvery careful to preserve.\r\n\r\nIt is related of him as having transpired at a later period, when Mr.\r\nGreig of Canandaigua, acting for the Ogden Company, was holding a council\r\nwith a view to purchase some of the smaller Indian reservations, lying\r\nalong the Genesee river, he was opposed step by step, by the persistent\r\nefforts of Red Jacket. Yet notwithstanding the opposition, Mr. Greig was\r\nsuccessful in securing the extinguishment of their title, to about eighty\r\nthousand acres of their land. When the time came for signing the deed, Mr.\r\nGreig said to Red Jacket,--\"_As you have been opposed to the sale of the\r\nland, you need not have your name attached to the deed_.\" But he would\r\nhear to nothing of the kind, and insisted upon signing it, seeming to take\r\npride in having his name appended to the paper. [Footnote: Conversation of\r\nthe author with the Hon. John Greig of Canandaigua. Some years ago a story\r\nillustrating the eloquence of Red Jacket went the rounds of the papers, in\r\nwhich Mr. Greig was represented as arguing a case in opposition to and as\r\nbeing defeated by Red Jacket. Not happening to see it at the time, the\r\nauthor sought for a copy, but learning that its principal statements were\r\nfictitious, he relinquished the undertaking. Mr. Greig never argued the\r\ncase as represented, but took down a speech from the interpreter which he\r\nread to the orator, who was much pleased with its correctness and bestowed\r\non him an Indian name, signifying--\"_a ready writer_.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nCouncil at Canawangus--Interesting reminiscence of Red Jacket--Address of\r\nFarmer's Brother--Jasper Parrish--Horatio Jones--Red Jacket's visit at\r\nHartford, Conn.\r\n\r\n\r\nA council of the Iroquois was held at Ca-na-wau-gus, near West Avon, in\r\nthe autumn of 1798. Connected with it is a reminiscence of Red Jacket of\r\nmuch interest, as an item of history, and it serves well to illustrate the\r\norator's mental habit.\r\n\r\nHis conduct was such on this occasion, as to excite the observation as\r\nwell as curiosity of Captain Parrish, who related the occurrence.\r\n\r\nFor the first few days of the council, he uttered not a word. He appeared\r\nto be in deep thought, and was exceedingly reserved.--The expression of\r\nhis countenance was severe, and there was much _hauteur_ in his manner. He\r\nate scarcely anything, and his appearance was so remarkable, as to excite\r\nthe wonder of all present. At length on the third or fourth day of the\r\ncouncil, he arose with great dignity, and solemnity of air, and commenced\r\nspeaking. His exordium was for the most part a beautiful and highly\r\nwrought enconium on the character and history of the Indians; particularly\r\nof his own people, in the past. They were taken back, as by a magic spell,\r\nto primitive times. The days of their renown, when the name and glory of\r\ntheir nation, were the admiration of the world. When from the rising to\r\nthe setting sun, there was no power to stand before them, or hinder the\r\nvictorious march of their warriors through the land. As they glided over\r\nthe waters of river or lake, as they ascended the mountain, or passed\r\nthrough the valley, they could feel that their dominion was wide, and\r\nundisputed. Every deer that bounded through the forest, every bird that\r\nwinged the air, and the fish in all the waters, were theirs, and they were\r\nhappy. Such was the glowing picture he drew, they did not realize the\r\npresent, from the engrossing theme of the past.\r\n\r\nHe next proceeded to sketch their history, as affected by the coming of\r\nthe white man among them. The friendly relations, that marked their early\r\nintercourse. Their small beginnings, and the imperceptible manner of their\r\nincrease. How they began to line the eastern shores,--plant themselves\r\nupon the borders of their rivers, and gather into neighborhoods, and\r\ntowns, and cities. How these new and wonderful things engaged the\r\nattention of the Indians, and kept them spell-bound, so that they were\r\ninsensible to what had been going on till the whites were firmly planted,\r\nlike a tree that has taken deep root, and sends its branches out over the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nHe next drew their attention to a time when the signs of a great tempest\r\nbegan to appear. When the clouds began to overspread the heavens, when the\r\nlightning flashed, and the thunders rolled, and the land was shaken by\r\ntheir power. A mighty whirlwind came sweeping through the land, the tall\r\ntrees of the forest were uprooted, the branches torn off and sent flying\r\nthrough the air. So has our nation he said been uprooted,--the strong men\r\ntorn from us, and scattered, and laid low. Thus he went on recounting as\r\nfew could, the circumstances of their history, and as he advanced, his\r\nexpressions matured in their intensity, his thoughts appeared to be\r\nwinged, and came glowing, as if from some furnace in nature, where all her\r\nmaterials are wrought under intense heat, and sent forth in forms of\r\nhighest brilliancy, and beauty. His hearers were amid the heavings of the\r\nearthquake,--the blackness of the storms,--the wild and irresistible sweep\r\nof the tornado. The heavens, the earth, the elements, seemed to be\r\ncareering under the rapid and startling flights of his fancy.\r\n\r\nHe next adverted with much feeling, and with evident sadness, to the\r\ntransactions of the past year, by which they had become dispossessed of\r\nthe largest part of their ancient inheritance: and then he drew, with a\r\nprophetic hand, a picture of their probable future, that brought sorrow to\r\ntheir hearts, and tears to their eyes.--He closed his harangue by\r\npronouncing a most withering phillipic against the whites.--The effect of\r\nhis speech was wonderful.--Mr. Parrish declared that it exceeded, in its\r\nbrilliancy and force, all his former utterances, of which he had any\r\nknowledge; and he never heard from him afterward, anything that could\r\ncompare with it. His auditors were mainly those of his own people. His\r\nflow of thought was not interrupted by the slow, and embarrassing process\r\nof interpretation. The full grief of his heart, in view of the\r\ntransactions of the previous year, was poured forth, and came like the\r\nirresistible sweep of a whirlwind. [Footnote: Conversation of the author\r\nwith Samuel J. Mills, Esq., formerly of Mt. Morris, N. Y., later of\r\nNevada, Iowa. Mr. Mills heard Mr. Parrish give this description of Red\r\nJacket and of his speech, while sitting at one time on the porch of one of\r\nthe hotels at Avon Springs. Mr. Parrish pointed out the ground occupied by\r\nthe Indians, when this speech was delivered. It was only a little distance\r\nfrom the porch where they were sitting.]\r\n\r\nIt was some little time after the delivery of this speech, before the\r\nminds of the Indians were sufficiently composed to attend to the main\r\nbusiness of their council, which was presented in a speech by Farmer's\r\nBrother, and embodied in an address to the Legislature of New York, thus:\r\n\"The Sachems, Chiefs and Warriors of the Seneca Nation, to the Sachems,\r\nand Chiefs assembled about the great Council Fire of the State of New\r\nYork:\r\n\r\n\"BROTHERS: As you are once more assembled in council for the purpose of\r\ndoing honor to yourselves and justice to your country, we, your brothers,\r\nthe Sachems, Chiefs and Warriors of the Seneca Nation, request you to open\r\nyour ears, and give attention to our voice and wishes.\r\n\r\n\"You will recollect the late contest between you and your father, the\r\ngreat king of England. This contest threw the inhabitants of this whole\r\nisland into a great tumult and commotion, like a raging whirlwind, which\r\ntears up the trees, and tosses to and fro the leaves, so that no one knows\r\nwhence they come, or where they will fall.\r\n\r\n\"BROTHERS: This whirlwind was so directed by the Great Spirit above, as to\r\nthrow into our arms two of your infant children, Jasper Parrish, and\r\nHoratio Jones. We adopted them into our families, and made them our\r\nchildren. We loved them and nourished them. They lived with us many years.\r\nAt length the Great Spirit spoke to the whirlwind, and it was still. A\r\nclear and uninterrupted sky appeared. The path of peace was opened, and\r\nthe chain of friendship was once more made bright. Then these, our adopted\r\nchildren, left us, to seek their relations. We wished them to return among\r\nus, and promised if they would return, and live in our country, to give\r\neach of them a seat of land for them, and their children to sit down upon.\r\n\r\n\"BROTHERS: They have returned, and have for several years past been\r\nserviceable to us as interpreters. We still feel our hearts beat in\r\naffection for them, and now wish to fulfil the promise we made them, and\r\nto reward them for their services. We have therefore made up our minds to\r\ngive them a seat of two square miles of land lying on the outlet of Lake\r\nErie, about three miles below Black Rock, beginning at the mouth of a\r\ncreek known by the name of Scoy-gu-quoy-des Creek, running one mile from\r\nthe river Niagara, up said creek, thence northerly as the river runs two\r\nmiles, thence westerly one mile to the river, thence up the river as the\r\nriver runs to the place of beginning, so as to contain two square miles.\r\n\r\n\"BROTHERS: We have now made known to you our minds; we expect and\r\nearnestly request that you will permit our friends to receive this our\r\ngift, and will make the same good to them, according to the laws and\r\ncustoms of your nation.\"\r\n\r\nBy the laws of the State, no sale or transfers of Indian lands could be\r\nmade to private individuals, without permission from the government. Hence\r\nthe address embodying the request as presented above, which was complied\r\nwith, and the land secured as desired by the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe above is certainly an able document, and has been justly admired for\r\nits originality, and the boldness of its figures. It is in keeping with\r\nthe high order of mind, that has marked the history of the Six Nations.\r\nOne expression in it has been pointed out, as an instance of the truly\r\nsublime: \"THE GREAT SPIRIT SPOKE TO THE WHIRLWIND, AND IT WAS STILL.\"\r\n\r\nWe may observe here that in tracing the history of the Iroquois, the\r\ninstances are not rare of a true nobility of character. Their confidence\r\nand esteem once secured, no slight cause would interrupt, none appreciated\r\nmore highly the offices of kindness,--and none would go further in making\r\na generous return for favors rendered.\r\n\r\nJasper Parrish and Horatio Jones were favorite interpreters of Red Jacket,\r\nand as they passed no inconsiderable part of their lives among the\r\nIndians, a further notice of their history is desirable.\r\n\r\nThe early life of Captain Jasper Parrish was marked by scenes alike trying\r\nand eventful. He was a native of Connecticut, from which State his family\r\nremoved to the waters of the Delaware, in the state of Pennsylvania. In\r\n1778, when but eleven years old, he accompanied his father on a short\r\nexpedition, to remove a family of backwoodsmen, to a less exposed part of\r\nthe settlement. On their way they were attacked by a small party of\r\nIndians, and made captives. The father was taken to Niagara, and after a\r\ncaptivity of two years, was exchanged and enabled to return to his own\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe son was claimed by a war-chief, who treated him kindly, and after a\r\ntime took him to the waters of the Chemung. On entering an Indian village,\r\nthe war-party which accompanied them, sounded the war-whoop, and it was\r\nanswered by the Indians and Indian boys who came out to meet them. They\r\npulled the young prisoner from the horse he was riding, scourged him with\r\nwhips, and beat him with the handles of their tomahawks, one of the forms\r\nof their gauntlet, until his master humanely rescued him. He was after\r\nthis sold to a family of Delawares, and taken to reside with them on the\r\nDelaware river, where he suffered much from want of proper clothing, and\r\nfrom scanty fare. To inure him to cold, the Indians compelled him almost\r\ndaily, to strip and plunge into the icy waters of the river.\r\n\r\nHe was with the Indians when General Sullivan invaded their country, and\r\nwitnessed their retreat, after the battle at Newtown, until they found\r\nprotection from the guns of the British, at Fort Niagara. Here they\r\nsubsisted during the winter by rations from the garrison, and to induce\r\nthem to return again to their villages, on the Genesee river, the officers\r\npledged them an increased bounty for American scalps.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, while with the Delaware family at Niagara, he came near\r\nbeing a victim of the British bounty for scalps. Left alone with some\r\nIndians, who were having a carousal, he overheard a proposal to kill the\r\nyoung Yankee, and take his scalp to the fort, and sell it for rum. In a\r\nfew moments one of them took a large brand from the fire and hurled at\r\nhim, but being on the alert he dodged it, and made his escape. The Indians\r\npursued, but it was dark and they did not find him.\r\n\r\nFrom the Delaware family, he was sold to an Indian of the Mohawk tribe,\r\ncalled Captain David Hill. At a council of the British and Indians, he was\r\nafterwards adopted with much ceremony, into the family of Captain Hill, as\r\nhis own son. He resided with him at the Mohawk settlement near the present\r\nvillage of Lewiston, till the close of the war, and being surrendered in\r\naccordance with the stipulations of the treaty at Fort Stanwix in 1784, he\r\nreturned once more to his own father's house.\r\n\r\nIt was with some effort he recovered again the use of his own native\r\ntongue. During his captivity he had acquired and could speak fluently, the\r\nlanguage of five different tribes, and his qualifications as an\r\ninterpreter, together with his known faithfulness and integrity, coming to\r\nthe knowledge of our government, he received an appointment in the Indian\r\nservice, and during the greater part of his subsequent life, was actively\r\nemployed in business relating to the welfare of the Indians. He died at\r\nhis residence in Canandaigua, July 12th, 1836, in the sixty-ninth year of\r\nhis age.\r\n\r\nCaptain Horatio Jones, was a native of Chester county, Pennsylvania. At\r\nthe age of sixteen he enlisted as a volunteer, in a company commanded by\r\nCaptain John Boyd. It was when the Indians, led by the notorious Butler,\r\nBrant, and Nellis, were committing their depredations and massacres among\r\nthe settlers of the frontier, sparing neither age nor sex, from the\r\ntomahawk and scalping knife. With the ardor of youth he engaged in the\r\nactive employments of a soldier, and accompanied Captain Boyd on several\r\nimportant and dangerous expeditions, in which himself and commander had\r\nthe good fortune to escape unhurt.\r\n\r\nAt length in the spring of 1781, while Captain Boyd and his men, numbering\r\nthirty-two, were in pursuit of Nellis, they were surprised by a large\r\nparty of Indians, who killed about half their number, and of the rest took\r\neight prisoners, Jones and his commanding officer being among the number.\r\nThe Indians conducted them to their towns on the Genesee river, where they\r\nhad to run the gauntlet, and having passed with safety through this trying\r\nordeal, they next came near losing their lives in a savage frolic. The\r\nwarriors, on returning from their excursion, gave themselves up to\r\ndrinking and merriment. Partaking freely of the intoxicating bowl, they\r\nsoon became much excited, and the ferocity, which a time of war engenders,\r\nwas thoroughly aroused among them. One of the prisoners they killed, and\r\nsevering his head from the body, carried it about the camp, on the end of\r\na pole, with wild shouts and frantic yells.\r\n\r\nThey next meditated the death of Boyd and Jones, and while discussing the\r\nmanner in which they would have them suffer, a few squaws conveyed them\r\naway and hid them. Jones was subsequently adopted into an Indian family,\r\nbecame familiar with their customs and language, and after the declaration\r\nof peace, was appointed by President Washington as Indian interpreter, the\r\nduties of which office he discharged with fidelity, until within a year or\r\ntwo of his death.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones was about the ordinary stature, firmly built, and qualified by\r\nnature for duties requiring activity and endurance. Possessing uncommon\r\nmental vigor, and quick perception, he was enabled to form a just estimate\r\nof character, and determine with readiness the springs of human action.\r\nHis bravery, physical power, energy and decision of character, gave him\r\ngreat command over the Indians with whom he was associated, and having\r\ntheir entire confidence, he was enabled to render the government\r\ninvaluable service in her treaties with the northern and north-western\r\ntribes. He was a favorite interpreter of Red Jacket, and his style is said\r\nto have been energetic, graphic, and chaste. He died at his residence near\r\nGenesee, on the 18th of August, 1836.\r\n\r\nIt was not far from the time of this council at Canawangus that Red Jacket\r\nvisited Hartford, Conn.\r\n\r\nIn the adjustment of the land difficulties between the states of\r\nConnecticut and Pennsylvania, owing to the indefinite terms of their\r\noriginal charters, Connecticut obtained, as we have seen, a title to that\r\npart of Ohio, called Western Reserve. The Senecas laying claim to this, on\r\nthe ground of conquest, negotiations were entered into with them for the\r\nextinguishment of their title. This was the occasion of the orator's\r\nvisit, concerning which there is but a very brief record. His appearance,\r\nhowever, has been spoken of in terms of high commendation, and a single\r\npassage only of the speech he made on that occasion has been preserved.\r\n\r\n\"We stand,\"--said he, when representing the condition of his people,--\"a\r\nsmall island in the bosom of the great waters. We are encircled,--we are\r\nencompassed. The evil spirit rides upon the blast, and the waters are\r\ndisturbed. They rise, they press upon us, and the waves once settled over\r\nus, we disappear forever. Who then lives to mourn us? None. What marks our\r\nextermination? Nothing. We are mingled with the common elements.\"\r\n\r\nThe entire speech was listened to with feelings of profound admiration,\r\nand his action elicited praise for its dignity and grace. He entered the\r\naugust assemblage, before which he was called to appear, with a step\r\nmeasured, firm and dignified,--a countenance erect, bold and discursive,--\r\nwithout manifesting surprise, fear or curiosity; and his effort sustaining\r\nfully his high reputation as an orator, made the occasion one of great\r\ninterest, to those whom it had been the means of bringing together, or who\r\nhad been attracted by curiosity, to see one whose fame had reached the\r\nland of steady habits. [Footnote: Col. Stone, from collections by J. W.\r\nMoulton.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nCornplanter in disrepute--Effort to regain his standing--Red Jacket\r\ncharged with witchcraft--His defense--Further notices of Cornplanter--\r\nEarly recollections--At the defeat of General Braddock in 1755--With the\r\nEnglish in the war of the Revolution--Takes his father a prisoner--His\r\naddress--Releases him--Address to the Governor of Pennsylvania--Visit of\r\nPresident Alden--Close of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot long after the large sale of their domain to Robert Morris, which had\r\nbeen negotiated at Big Tree, the Senecas began to realize that they had\r\ncommitted a great mistake. The broad lands, mountain, hill, and valley,\r\nover which they had roamed, the springs and streams of water by whose side\r\nthey had been wont to encamp, and above all the graves of their sires,\r\nwhere affection's altar had been hallowed by their sighs and tears, these\r\nwere still in view, but they appeared not as in days gone by, to wear for\r\nthem the smiles of old and long tried friends. They seemed to present a\r\nlook and utter a voice of reproach, as though chiding them for having\r\nbroken in upon the harmony of those time honored arrangements, which had\r\nbound them together, and the thought of this filled their minds with\r\nanxiety and grief. Had they been aware of the sorrow they would experience\r\nin looking upon these lands, as no longer their own, their consent to part\r\nwith them would not so readily have been given.\r\n\r\nThe reverse which thereupon took place in their minds, fell heavily on\r\nthose who had taken the most active part of the business of selling their\r\ncountry. Cornplanter, having borne a prominent part in these proceedings,\r\nfell deeply under the displeasure of his people. Their displeasure was so\r\nmarked as to lead him to cast about for some means of relief. Aware of the\r\ncredulity and superstition of his people, he resolved to avail himself of\r\nthese characteristics of his nation, to accomplish the end he had in view.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose he was in consultation with his brother Ga-ne-o-di-yo,\r\nwho on one occasion terminated a scene of great dissipation, by the\r\nannouncement that he had been delegated by the Great Spirit, with a new\r\nrevelation, and with supernatural gifts. A severe illness became the\r\noccasion during which he made a visit to the unseen world, where visions\r\nand revelations of a most extraordinary nature, had been made known to\r\nhim. The happiness of the good, and the tortures of the wicked, had thus\r\nbecome matters of personal observation. The announcement of these, in\r\nlanguage and gesture indicating his assurance of their reality, gained for\r\nhim credence among the people, as well as chiefs of his nation, and he was\r\nreceived as a prophet.\r\n\r\nHis earliest attempts were successful in accomplishing a desirable reform,\r\nespecially among the Onondagas, the most profligate of the Six Nations,\r\nfrom the degrading vice of intemperance. His influence in this direction\r\nwas salutary, and had he confined his efforts to the recovery of his\r\npeople from drunkenness, his mission would truly have been one of mercy,\r\nand his career might have terminated with the highest usefulness and\r\nhonor.\r\n\r\nBut sympathizing with Cornplanter, his brother, he conceived the idea of\r\ninstituting against their enemies, the charge of _witchcraft_. In this\r\nthe Indians generally believed, and a charge of this nature, coming from\r\nsuch a source, was a very grave matter. Through the instrumentality of\r\nCongress selected by himself, the sentence of death was procured against\r\ncertain \"familiars of Satan,\" and this sentence would have been executed,\r\nhad there been no interference, from the knowledge of it coming to the\r\nwhites, living in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nIn no way discouraged, but rather emboldened by their success, they\r\nproceeded so far as to bring such a charge against Red Jacket himself, who\r\nwas thus publicly denounced, at a great council held at Buffalo Creek, and\r\nput upon trial.\r\n\r\nA degree of rivalry had hitherto existed between Cornplanter and Red\r\nJacket, and as the former descended in the estimation of his people, for\r\nthe part he had taken in the sale of their lands, the latter rose for the\r\nsame reason, so that the highest aim of Cornplanter was reached, when he\r\ncould, by this means, affect materially the character, and influence of\r\nhis distinguished rival.\r\n\r\nThe orator was thus placed in circumstances the most critical and trying,\r\nof any that had hitherto met him in life. He perceived at a glance, that\r\nhis entire history in the future, would depend on the decision that would\r\nthen and there take place. He might be doomed, if his life were spared,\r\nand this was not altogether certain, to be the victim of surmises and\r\nsuperstitions, that would be annoying, if they did not prove to be utterly\r\ndestructive of his happiness. He accordingly summoned himself for an\r\neffort as great, as his position was dangerous.\r\n\r\nHe conducted the trial in his own defense. In this he exhibited the\r\nexceeding wariness, which was ever a prominent characteristic of his\r\nnature. The slightest circumstance affecting the character, or bearing\r\nsuspiciously upon his adversary was not overlooked, and his history was\r\nscanned with the searching scrutiny of a mind, that seemed to grasp\r\nintuitively, the secret springs, which had influenced his conduct. One by\r\none the professions that had formed his garb of sanctity, were exposed to\r\nthe burning power of his keen satire, and step by step he advanced to a\r\npoint, where, from the full assurance he had established this conviction\r\nin the minds of his people, he pronounced him AN IMPOSTER,--A CHEAT.\r\n[Footnote: Conversation of the author with Wm. Jones, a chief among the\r\nSenecas, and a son-in-law of Red Jacket.]\r\n\r\nHis speech riveted the attention of his hearers for nearly three hours. He\r\nprevailed. \"THE IRON BROW OF SUPERSTITION RELENTED UNDER THE MAGIC POWER\r\nOF HIS ELOQUENCE.\"--The Indians divided and a majority appeared in his\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\"--says the distinguished author just quoted,--\"the annals of\r\nhistory cannot furnish a more conspicuous instance of the triumph and\r\npower of oratory, in a barbarous nation, devoted to superstition, and\r\nlooking up to the accuser as a delegated minister of the Almighty.\"\r\n[Footnote: Governor Clinton's Historical Discourse.]\r\n\r\nThe victory which Red Jacket thus achieved recoiled heavily on\r\nCornplanter, and gave him a blow, from which he never afterward fully\r\nrecovered. He retired to his reservation, on the waters of the Alleghany\r\nriver, within the boundaries of Pennsylvania, where he devoted himself,\r\nduring the remainder of his long life, to the elevation and improvement of\r\nhis people. He did not, after the example of his great rival Red Jacket,\r\nspurn the improvements of civilization, but engaged in agriculture after\r\nthe example of the whites, and welcomed to his abode the teachers of\r\nchristianity, and himself openly avowed his belief in its doctrines.\r\n\r\nCornplanter was a native of Ca-na-wan-gus, on the Genesee river, a half\r\nbreed, the son of an Indian trader, from the valley of the Mohawk, a white\r\nman named John O'Bail. Of his early life little is known further than he\r\nhimself intimated, in a letter written long afterward, to the governor of\r\nPennsylvania:--In which he said,--\"When I was a child I played with the\r\nbutterfly, the grasshopper, and the frogs; and as I grew up, I began to\r\npay some attention, and play with the Indian boys in the neighborhood; and\r\nthey took notice of my skin, being a different color from theirs and spoke\r\nabout it. I inquired of my mother the cause, and she told me that my\r\nfather was a resident in Albany. I still ate my victuals out of a bark\r\ndish. I grew up to be a young man, and married me a wife, and I had no\r\nkettle or gun. I then knew where my father lived, and went to see him, and\r\nfound he was a white man, and spoke the English language. He gave me\r\nvictuals, while I was at his house, but when I started to return home, he\r\ngave me no provision to eat on the way. He gave me neither kettle or gun.\"\r\n\r\nHe was with his people when they fought in alliance with the French in the\r\nyear 1755. The principal part of the force which met and defeated the\r\nEnglish under General Braddock was Indian, and it was through their\r\nprowess mainly, if not entirely, that the victory was gained.\r\n\r\nWhat part Cornplanter took in that engagement is not known, but in the war\r\nof the Revolution, he was a war-chief, and ranked high in the estimation\r\nof his people.\r\n\r\nIn a speech addressed to President Washington in 1790, he related the\r\nmanner in which the Indians came to be in alliance with the English.\r\n\r\n\"Many nations inhabited this country; but they had no wisdom, therefore\r\nthey warred together. The Six Nations were powerful and compelled them to\r\npeace; the lands to a great extent were given up to them; the French came\r\namong us and built Niagara; they became our fathers and took care of us.\r\nSir William Johnson came and took that fort from the French; he became our\r\nfather and promised to take care of us, and did so until you were too\r\nstrong for his king.\r\n\r\n\"When you kindled your thirteen fires separately, the wise men that\r\nassembled at them told us that you were all brothers, the children of one\r\ngreat father, who regarded the red people also as his children. They\r\ncalled us brothers, and invited us to his protection; they told us that he\r\nresided beyond the great water, where the sun first rises; that he was a\r\nking whose power no people could resist, and that his goodness was as\r\nbright as that sun. What they said went to our hearts; we accepted the\r\ninvitation, and promised to obey him. What the Seneca Nation promise, they\r\nfaithfully perform; and when you refused obedience to that king, he\r\ncommanded us to assist his beloved men, in making you sober. In obeying\r\nhim we did no more than yourselves had led us to promise. The men that\r\nclaimed this promise told us that you were children, and had no guns; that\r\nwhen they had shaken you, you would submit. We hearkened to them and were\r\ndeceived.\"\r\n\r\nAs a leader he was very active and brave, and as a partisan of the\r\nEnglish, bore a prominent part in all of the principal engagements, in\r\nwhich the Indians were concerned during that war. He was on the war-path\r\nwith Brant during the campaign of General Sullivan against the Indian\r\ntowns in the Genesee country in 1779, and also when under the command of\r\nBrant and Sir John Johnson, the Indians subsequently avenged the invasion\r\nof Sullivan, by the fearful destruction they wrought in the valley of the\r\nMohawk.\r\n\r\nIt was during this expedition that Cornplanter visited his father a second\r\ntime. He was residing then in the vicinity of Fort Plain, and ascertaining\r\nwhere he lived, Cornplanter watched his opportunity and made his father a\r\nprisoner, but managed so adroitly, as to avoid recognition. He marched his\r\nsire ten or twelve miles up the river, and then stepped in front of him,\r\nfaced about, and addressed him in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n\"My name is John O'Bail, commonly called Cornplanter. I am your son! You\r\nare my father! You are now my prisoner, and subject to the customs of\r\nIndian warfare. But you shall not be harmed: you need not fear. I am a\r\nwarrior! Many are the scalps I have taken! Many the prisoners I have\r\ntortured to death! I am your son! I was anxious to see you, and greet you\r\nin friendship. I went to your cabin, and took you by force. But your life\r\nshall be spared. Indians love their friends and their kindred, and treat\r\nthem with kindness. If now you choose to follow the fortunes of your\r\nyellow son, and to live with our people, I will cherish your old age with\r\nplenty of venison, and you shall live easy. But if it is your choice to\r\nreturn to your fields, and live with your white children, I will send a\r\nparty of my trusty young men to conduct you back in safety. I respect you,\r\nmy father: you have been friendly to Indians, and they are your friends.\"\r\n\r\nThe father preferred to return to his white children, and was therefore\r\nset at liberty, and escorted back in safety to his own home.\r\n\r\nIn another address to the governor of Pennsylvania, he used this language:\r\n\"I will now tell you, that the Great Spirit has made known to me that I\r\nhave been wicked; and the cause was the Revolutionary war in America. The\r\ncause of Indians having been led into sin, at that time, was that many of\r\nthem, were in the practice of drinking and getting intoxicated. Great\r\nBritain requested us to join with them in the conflict against the\r\nAmericans, and promised the Indians land and liquor. I myself was opposed\r\nto joining in the conflict, as I had nothing to do with the difficulty\r\nbetween the two parties.\r\n\r\n\"They told me they would inform me of the cause of the Revolution, which I\r\nrequested them to do minutely. They then said it was on account of the\r\nheavy taxes, imposed on them by the British government, which had been for\r\nfifty years increasing upon them; that the Americans had grown weary\r\nthereof, and refused to pay, which affronted the king. There had likewise\r\na difficulty taken place about some tea, which they wished me not to use,\r\nas it had been one of the causes that many people had lost their lives.\r\nAnd the British government now being affronted, the war commenced, and the\r\ncannons began to roar in our country.\r\n\r\n\"The white people who live at Warren, called on me, some time ago to pay\r\ntaxes for my land; which I objected to, as I had never been called upon\r\nfor that purpose before; and having refused to pay, the white people\r\nbecame irritated, called upon me frequently, and at length brought four\r\nguns with them, and seized our cattle. I still refused to pay, and was not\r\nwilling to let the cattle go. After a time of dispute, they returned home,\r\nand I understood the militia was ordered out to enforce the collection of\r\nthe tax. I went to Warren, and to avert the impending difficulty, was\r\nobliged to give my note for the tax, the amount of which was forty-three\r\ndollars and seventy-nine cents. It is my desire that the governor will\r\nexempt me from paying taxes for my land to the white people; and also\r\ncause that the money I am now obliged to pay, may be refunded to me, as I\r\nam very poor.\"\r\n\r\nThis appeal was brought before the Legislature of Pennsylvania, and an act\r\nwas passed by which the chief was exonerated from the tax.\r\n\r\nOne writer speaks of him as possessing uncommon genius, a strong and\r\ndiscriminating mind, and as having the power of enduring great mental\r\napplication. He anxiously inquired into the evidences in support of the\r\nscripture account of creation, and of the scheme of doctrines which\r\nChristianity unfolded.\r\n\r\nPresident Alden of Alleghany college, speaks with delight of a visit he\r\nmade to the old chief. He found him on the banks of the Alleghany, on a\r\npiece of first rate bottom land, a little within the limits of\r\nPennsylvania. He was the owner of thirteen hundred acres of land, on a\r\npart of which stood his village, whose inhabitants gave signs of industry\r\nand thrift.\r\n\r\nHe found it pleasant to behold the agricultural habits of the place as\r\nappeared from the numerous enclosures of buckwheat, corn and oats. He also\r\nspeaks of seeing a number of oxen, cows and horses; and many logs designed\r\nfor the saw mill, and the Pittsburgh market. \"Cornplanter had for some\r\ntime been very much in favor of the christian religion, and hailed with\r\njoy such as professed it. When apprised of Mr. Alden's arrival he hastened\r\nto welcome him to his village, and to wait upon him. And notwithstanding\r\nhis high station as a chief, having many men under his command, he chose\r\nrather, in the ancient patriarchal style, to serve his visitors himself;\r\nhe therefore took care of their horses, and went into the field and cut\r\nand brought oats for them.\" [Footnote: Drake's book of the Indians.]\r\n\r\nHe died at his reservation March 7th, 1836, a hundred winters having\r\npassed over him, and was buried beneath the sheltering branches of a noble\r\ntree standing in his field. No other monument marks his grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nChange in Red Jacket's views--How caused--His opposition to Christianity--\r\nVisit of a Missionary--Missionary's speech--Red Jacket's reply--Unpleasant\r\ntermination of the Council.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs time advanced, the mind of Red Jacket gradually receded from the\r\nfavorable opinion he had entertained, with respect to the introduction\r\namong his people, of the customs of civilized life. Before this he\r\nregarded with favor the philanthropic designs of Washington and others,\r\nwhich contemplated such a change. But henceforth his influence and\r\nenergies were uniformly exerted, in resisting any innovation, upon the\r\nanciently established usages of the Iroquois. Several causes seemed to\r\ninfluence such a result.\r\n\r\nFirst of all was the condition of his people, as affected by the whites.\r\nThey had been wasted and greatly enfeebled by the wars carried on between\r\nthe whites, taking sides, as in the Revolution, against each other. And in\r\ntheir own conflicts, though in some instances successful, they had been so\r\neffectually overcome, that no hope now remained to them of resistance by\r\nwar; no matter what combinations they might be able to effect among\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nA still deeper source of regret, was the loss of so large a portion of\r\ntheir wide and beautiful country. Since parting with it, swarms of\r\nsettlers had been flocking to the more favored portions, and were\r\nirresistibly advancing to full and entire possession. The idea that they\r\ncould have their country to hunt in, as well after it was sold as before,\r\nwas rapidly dissipated by the busy sounds, all through the forest, of the\r\nwoodman's axe, and by the roar of the stately trees, as they fell down\r\nbefore the enterprising pioneer. The Indian brooded over this in silence,\r\nwhile all of these sounds, delightful to the emigrant, were as a knell of\r\ndeath to his ear. The eloquence of Red Jacket had been exerted in vain, to\r\narrest the progress of the white men. Onward they swept, bidding defiance\r\nto all the obstacles in their way. They were in possession of the ancient\r\nseats of the Iroquois. The red man's inheritance, was but a beggarly\r\nportion, when compared with his former princely domain. The thought of\r\nthis weighed heavily upon Red Jacket's lofty spirit, and affected\r\nmaterially the disposition with which he regarded the white man.\r\n\r\nHe had observed also that the Indian had not been improved, but rather\r\nmade worse by intercourse with the white man. He more readily acquired his\r\nvices, than his virtues.\r\n\r\nThe schools likewise that had been established among the Indians, had not\r\nbeen attended with very salutary results. And some of the Indian boys that\r\nhad been sent to the schools of the whites, had failed to be qualified for\r\nusefulness among white men, and were unfitted in their tastes and habits\r\nfor a life among the Indians. As was observed by Red Jacket: \"they have\r\nreturned to their kindred and color, neither white men nor Indians. The\r\narts they have learned are incompatible with the chase, and ill adapted to\r\nour customs. They have been taught that which is useless to us. They have\r\nbeen made to feel artificial wants, which never entered the minds of their\r\nbrothers. They have imbibed, in your great towns, the seeds of vices,\r\nwhich were unknown in the forest. They become discouraged and dissipated,\r\n--despised by the Indians, neglected by the whites, and without value to\r\neither,--less honest than the former, and perhaps more knavish than the\r\nlatter.\" [Footnote: Washington had always been earnest in his desire to\r\ncivilize the savages, but had little faith in the expedient which had been\r\npursued, of sending their young men to our colleges; the true means he\r\nthought, was to introduce the arts and habits of husbandry among them.--\r\nIrving's Life of Washington.] Red Jacket was not alone in this opinion.\r\n\r\nOne of Cornplanter's sons, Henry O'Bail, had been educated in\r\nPhiladelphia; but on returning to his people, became a drunkard, and was\r\ndiscarded by his father. He had other sons, but resolved that no more of\r\nthem should be educated among the whites, for said he, \"it entirely spoils\r\nIndian.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have we here?\" exclaimed Red Jacket on one occasion addressing one\r\nof them. \"What have we here? _You are neither a white man, or an Indian;\r\nfor heaven's sake tell us, what are you?_\"\r\n\r\nBut further than this, Red Jacket had witnessed among the whites so many\r\nevidences of deceit and fraud; he had so often seen the Indians\r\ncircumvented by their avarice and craft, that he looked with suspicion\r\neven on their attempts to do the Indians good. The language of the Trojan\r\npatriot concerning the Greeks--represents very nearly the feelings he\r\nentertained toward the whites.\r\n\r\n  \"Timeo Danaos et dona ferrentes.\r\n  \"The Greeks I fear, e'en in the gifts they bear.\"\r\n\r\nHence Red Jacket began to look unfavorably on the attempts that had been\r\nmade to civilize the Indian. He scorned to use the white man's axe, or\r\nhoe, or any implement of husbandry. He would not even use his language.\r\nUnderstanding well what was said to him in English, he spurned the idea of\r\nholding any communication with a white man, save through an interpreter.\r\nThe Indian he looked upon as the rightful lord of this part of creation,\r\nthe white man, as an intruder. The white man's ways were good for the\r\nwhite man; but in his view they would spoil the Indian. He believed that\r\nthe peculiar characteristics of the Indian, were conferred on him by the\r\nGreat Spirit for a wise purpose, and for his good, they needed to be\r\nmaintained. Hence all the ancient habits of his people, he earnestly\r\nstrove to preserve, and had it been in his power, he would have built a\r\nwall like the Chinese, to keep his people from meeting with, and being\r\ncontaminated by the whites. He would frown contempt on the Indian, who\r\nused a stool or chair in his cabin, and no king in his palace, ever sat\r\nmore proudly, or with greater dignity on his throne, than did Red Jacket\r\non his bear-skin in his humble dwelling.\r\n\r\nWe can but admire in this, his independence of character; and when we\r\nreflect upon his conduct as influenced by the conviction, that such a\r\ncourse was essential for the good of his people, we may view it as\r\nmeriting the praise of philanthrophy. Had he been as firm in resisting\r\nevery enticement of the whites, he would have maintained a greater\r\nconsistency, and himself attained a higher degree of excellence.\r\n\r\nRed Jacket was equally opposed to the introduction of Christianity among\r\nhis people. He looked upon the religion of the white man, with the same\r\nfeeling of suspicion and distrust as everything else coming from that\r\nsource. He had no evidence from experience, of the benefits that would\r\narise to them from its introduction among them. On the contrary his\r\nconvictions, arising from observation, were against it; because he saw his\r\npeople were made worse, by associating with the whites. When asked on one\r\noccasion, why he was opposed to the coming of missionaries among his\r\npeople, he replied,--\"Because they do us no good. If they are not useful\r\namong the white people, why do they send them among the Indians?--If they\r\nare useful to the white people, why do they not keep them at home? They\r\nare surely bad enough, to need the labor of every one, who can make them\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians made no distinction between those who professed religion and\r\nthose who made no profession. Their own religion was national. There was\r\nno division between the religious and irreligious. All were religious. In\r\nother words, they were all educated in the same faith, all united in\r\nobserving the same religious rites, and all entertained the same religious\r\nbelief, as had been handed down to them from their forefathers. This was\r\nsalutary in promoting among them many virtues, worthy of commendation.\r\nThey very properly estimated the value of religion, by the practical\r\ninfluence it exerted on those who received it. And they judged of the\r\nChristian religion, by the conduct and character of the nation that\r\nreceived and cherished it; who were nominally Christian.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the success of Christianity among them, they had\r\nwitnessed so much deceit and fraud, there were so many among the whites,\r\nwho were ready to take advantage of them,--to make them drunk, and then\r\ncheat them, they were unable to perceive in what way the religion of the\r\nwhites, from whom they had received such treatment, could be better or as\r\ngood, even as their own. They had not learned to regard those only as\r\nChristians, who reduced the principles of Christianity to practice, and\r\nwere not aware that as a system, it enforced only what was right, and\r\ntolerated no conduct that was wrong.\r\n\r\nHence in the efforts made to introduce Christianity among the Senecas, we\r\nfind Red Jacket summoning the entire force of his influence, and eloquence\r\nin opposition to the measure.\r\n\r\nThe arrival among them of a missionary from Massachusetts, was the\r\noccasion of a forensic effort, which defines very clearly his position,\r\nand though it may have suffered, as did most of his speeches, from coming\r\nthrough an interpreter, it displays nevertheless, indications of deep\r\nthought, and of a high order of talent. It was regarded at the time as an\r\neffort of great ability, and is perhaps as fair a specimen of his oratory,\r\nas has come down to us from the past.\r\n\r\nA council having been called to consider the matter, the missionary was\r\nintroduced, who spoke as follows: [Footnote: The speech of the missionary\r\nis quoted from Col. Stone; the reply of Red Jacket from Drake, who is Col.\r\nStone's authority for the same speech.]\r\n\r\n\"My Friends: I am thankful for the opportunity afforded us of meeting\r\ntogether at this time. I had a great desire to see you, and inquire into\r\nyour state and welfare. For this purpose I have traveled a great distance,\r\nbeing sent by your old friends, the Boston Missionary Society. You will\r\nrecollect they formerly sent missionaries among you, to instruct you in\r\nreligion, and labor for your good. Although they have not heard from you\r\nfor a long time, yet they have not forgotten their brothers, the Six\r\nNations, and are still anxious to do you good.\r\n\r\n\"Brothers: I have not come to get your lands, or your money, but to\r\nenlighten your minds, and instruct you how to worship the Great Spirit,\r\nagreeably to his mind and will, and to preach to you the gospel of his\r\nSon, Jesus Christ. There is but one religion, and but one way to serve\r\nGod, and if you do not embrace the right way, you can not be happy\r\nhereafter. You have never worshipped the Great Spirit, in a manner\r\nacceptable to him, but have all your lives, been in great errors and\r\ndarkness. To endeavor to remove these errors, and open your eyes, so that\r\nyou might see clearly, is my business with you.\r\n\r\n\"Brothers: I wish to talk with you as one friend talks with another; and\r\nif you have any objections to receive the religion which I preach, I wish\r\nyou to state them; and I will endeavor to satisfy your minds, and remove\r\nthe objections.\r\n\r\n\"Brothers: I want you to speak your minds freely; for I wish to reason\r\nwith you on the subject, and if possible remove all doubts, if there be\r\nany on your minds. The subject is an important one, and it is of\r\nconsequence, that you give it an early attention, while the offer is made\r\nyou. Your friends, the Boston Missionary Society, will continue to send\r\nyou good and faithful ministers, to instruct and strengthen you in\r\nreligion, if on your part you are willing to receive them.\r\n\r\n\"Brothers: Since I have been in this part of the country, I have visited\r\nsome of your small villages, and talked with your people. They appear\r\nwilling to receive instruction, but as they look up to you, as their elder\r\nbrothers in council, they want first to know your opinion on the subject.\r\nYou have now heard what I have to propose at present. I hope you will take\r\nit into consideration, and give me an answer before we part.\"\r\n\r\nThe chiefs were in consultation for about two hours, when Red Jacket arose\r\nand spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Friend and Brother: It was the will of the Great Spirit that we should\r\nmeet together this day. He orders all things, and has given us a fine day\r\nfor our council. He has taken his garment from before the sun, and caused\r\nit to shine with brightness upon us. Our eyes are opened that we see\r\nclearly; our ears are unstopped, that we have been able to hear distinctly\r\nthe words you have spoken. For all these favors we thank the Great Spirit,\r\nand Him only.\r\n\r\n\"Brother: This council fire was kindled by you. It was at your request\r\nthat we came together at this time. We have listened with attention to\r\nwhat you have said. You requested us to speak our minds freely. This gives\r\nus great joy: for now we consider that we stand upright before you, and\r\ncan speak what we think. All have heard your voice, and all speak to you\r\nnow as one man. Our minds are agreed.\r\n\r\n\"Brother: You say you want an answer to your talk before you leave this\r\nplace. It is right you should have one, as you are a great distance from\r\nhome, and we do not wish to detain you. But we will first look back a\r\nlittle, and tell you what our fathers have told us, and what we have heard\r\nfrom the white people.\r\n\r\n\"Brother: Listen to what we say.--There was a time when our fathers owned\r\nthis _great island_. [Footnote: The term used by the Indians when\r\nspeaking of this continent.] Their seats extended from the rising to the\r\nsetting sun. The Great Spirit had made it for the Indians. He had created\r\nthe buffalo, the deer, and other animals for food. He had made the bear,\r\nand the beaver. Their skins served us for clothing. He had scattered them\r\nover the country, and taught us how to take them. He had caused the earth\r\nto produce corn for bread. All this he had done for his red children\r\nbecause he loved them. If we had some disputes about our hunting ground,\r\nthey were generally settled without the shedding of much blood. But an\r\nevil day came upon us. Your forefathers crossed the great water, and\r\nlanded on this island. Their numbers were small. They found friends and\r\nnot enemies. They told us they had fled from their own country for fear of\r\nwicked men, and had come here to enjoy their religion. They asked for a\r\nsmall seat. We took pity on them, granted their request, and they sat down\r\namongst us. We gave them corn and meat; they gave us poison in return.\r\n[Footnote: Spirituous liquors.]\r\n\r\n\"The white people had now found our country. Tidings were carried back,\r\nand more came amongst us. Yet we did not fear them. They called us\r\nbrothers. We believed them and gave them a larger seat. At length their\r\nnumbers had greatly increased. They wanted more land;--they wanted our\r\ncountry. Our eyes were opened, and our minds became uneasy.\r\n\r\n\"Wars took place. Indians were hired to fight against Indians, and many of\r\nour people were destroyed. They also brought strong liquors among us;--\r\nthey were strong and powerful, and have slain thousands.\r\n\r\n\"Brother: Our seats were once large, and yours were very small. You have\r\nnow become a great people, and we have scarcely a place left to spread our\r\nblankets. You have got our country, but are not satisfied;--you want to\r\nforce your religion upon us.\r\n\r\n\"Brother: Continue to listen. You say that you are sent to instruct us how\r\nto worship the Great Spirit agreeably to his mind, and if we do not take\r\nhold of this religion which you white people teach, we shall be unhappy\r\nhereafter. You say that you are right, that we are lost. How do we know\r\nthis to be true? We understand that your religion is written in a book. If\r\nit was intended for us as well as you, why has not the Great Spirit given\r\nit to us, and not only to us, but why did he not give to our forefathers\r\nthe knowledge of that book, with the means of understanding it rightly? We\r\nonly know what you tell us about it. How shall we know when to believe,\r\nbeing so often deceived by the white people?\r\n\r\n\"BROTHER: You say there is but one way to worship and serve the Great\r\nSpirit. If there is but one religion why do you white people differ so\r\nmuch about it? Why are you not all agreed,--as you can all read the book?\r\n\r\n\"BROTHER: We do not understand these things. We are told that your\r\nreligion was given to your forefathers, and has been handed down from\r\nfather to son. We also have a religion which was given to our forefathers\r\nand has been handed down to us their children. We worship in that way. It\r\nteaches us to be thankful for all the favors we receive; to love each\r\nother, and to be united. We never quarrel about religion.\r\n\r\n\"BROTHER: The Great Spirit has made us all, but he has made a great\r\ndifference between his white and red children. He has given us different\r\ncomplexions, and different customs. To you He has given the arts. To these\r\nHe has not opened our eyes. We know these things to be true. Since He has\r\nmade so great a difference between us in other things, why may we not\r\nconclude that He has given us a different religion according to our\r\nunderstanding? The Great Spirit does right. He knows what is best for is\r\nchildren; we are satisfied.\r\n\r\n\"BROTHER: We do not wish to destroy your religion, or take it from you. We\r\nonly want to enjoy our own.\r\n\r\n\"BROTHER: You say you have not come to get our land or our money, but to\r\nenlighten our minds. I will now tell you that I have been at your\r\nmeetings, and saw you collect money from the meeting. I cannot tell what\r\nthis money was intended for, but suppose it was for your minister, and if\r\nwe should conform to your way of thinking, perhaps you may want some from\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\"BROTHER: We are told that you have been preaching to the white people in\r\nthis place. These people are our neighbors. We are acquainted with them.\r\nWe will wait a little while, and see what effect your preaching has on\r\nthem. If we find it does them good, makes them honest, and less disposed\r\nto cheat Indians, we will then consider again of what you have said.\r\n\r\n\"BROTHER: You have now heard our answer to your talk, and this is all we\r\nhave to say at present. As we are going to part, we will come and take you\r\nby the hand, and hope the Great Spirit will protect you on your journey,\r\nand return you in safety to your friends.\"\r\n\r\nSuiting the action to the word, he then drew near the missionary with the\r\nother chiefs, to take him by the hand; but he would not receive them, and\r\nrising hastily from his seat, said, there was no fellowship between the\r\nreligion of God, and the works of the devil, and he could not therefore\r\njoin hands with them.\r\n\r\nWhen this was interpreted to the Indians, they smiled and retired from the\r\ninterview, without saying anything further.\r\n\r\nSuch is the account given of this transaction. The termination is painful.\r\nIt is a sad thought, that when the Indians had been invited to make known\r\ntheir objections, if they had any; and when they had been offered in good\r\nfaith by this unlettered son of the forest, he should have been answered\r\nwith so little patience or kindness. We hesitate not to say that the red\r\nman in this, manifested the better spirit.\r\n\r\nMr. Crane afterward regretted the course he had taken, saying, \"he\r\nsupposed by shaking hands with them, they would regard it as signifying\r\nhis approval of what they had said.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTecumseh and Indian confederation--Aid given by Elskawata--Doings at the\r\nProphet's Town--Great Indian Council at the West--Red Jacket's claim for\r\nprecedence of the Senecas--His adherence to the United States--Hostilities\r\nencouraged by British Agents--Warriors gathered at Prophet's Town--Visited\r\nby Gen. Harrison at the head of his troops--Hostilities disclaimed--\r\nSurprised by a sudden attack--Indians defeated--War proclaimed against\r\nEngland--Indians take sides--Unfavorable commencement--Different successes\r\n--Part taken by Red Jacket.\r\n\r\n\r\nSixteen years had intervened since the treaty of peace, concluded with the\r\nIndians at Greenville, by General Wayne in 1795. During this time friendly\r\nrelations had been maintained with the various Indian tribes, who were in\r\ncorrespondence with the United States. This period had not closed,\r\nhowever, ere the ambitious designs of an active and influential chief,\r\nbegan to wear the appearance of open hostility.\r\n\r\nThe possession of rare mental endowments, together with physical\r\nqualifications, that were the means of extending his renown, as an\r\nintrepid brave, far beyond the boundaries of his own tribe, rendered the\r\nname of Tecumseh, a rallying word for the dusky warriors, even among the\r\nremote wilds visited by the Indian. Tecumseh entertained the ambitious\r\nproject, at various times a favorite design with the Indian, of uniting\r\nall their tribes at the West and South-west, in one strenuous endeavor, to\r\nresist the further advance of the whites into their country, and of\r\nforming here a confederacy, similar to that which had existed among the\r\nIroquois.\r\n\r\nIn these views he was greatly assisted and strengthened by the influence\r\nand efforts of his brother, Elskawata.\r\n\r\nElskawata, on the death of Penagashega, an aged and revered prophet, very\r\nadroitly assumed the sacred office of this Indian saint, and began to\r\nproclaim himself, as a delegated messenger of the Great Spirit to his\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nHe commenced his career among the Shawnees, the people of his tribe, as\r\nearly as 1805. But not content with so narrow a sphere for his endeavors,\r\nhe went from tribe to tribe, and assembled as he was able, different\r\nnations, that he might make known to them the important instructions, he\r\nhad been divinely authorized to communicate.\r\n\r\nFor a long time his efforts wore the appearance of a religious, and\r\npacific character. He proclaimed the high superiority of the Indians over\r\nthe whites, and of his own tribe among the Indian tribes. He declared it\r\nto be the will of the Great Spirit, that the Indians should abandon the\r\nuse of intoxicating drinks, refrain from intermarrying with the whites,\r\nlive at peace with each other, have their property in common, and maintain\r\ntheir customs, as they had been anciently established. At a later period\r\nhe affirmed with much solemnity, that he had received power from the Great\r\nSpirit, to cure all diseases, confound his enemies, and stay the arm of\r\ndeath, in sickness, or on the field of battle.\r\n\r\nAs time advanced, the prophet passed from nation, to nation, artfully\r\nsustaining his assumptions, and proclaiming his doctrines. He gathered\r\naround him adherents from various tribes, encouraged pilgrimages to his\r\ncamp, became conspicuous in all their general councils, and extended his\r\ninfluence to the various Indian towns, in the vicinity of the northern\r\nlakes, and on the broad plains, watered by the Mississippi and its\r\nbranches. He could now, as he did, forward very effectively the ambitious\r\nviews of his brother Tecumseh.\r\n\r\nFrom the Prophet's town, which was established on the banks of the Wabash,\r\nnear the mouth of its tributary the Tippecanoe, as early as 1808, a\r\ncorrespondence was kept up with the numerous tribes at the North and West,\r\nand means were taken also to extend the combination they were forming, to\r\nthe Cherokees and other nations of the South. Runners were sent as far\r\neven as the country of the Senecas, and the Iroquois in New York and\r\nCanada, were solicited to join the Great Western Confederacy.\r\n\r\nConnected with this movement was the holding of Indian councils, at\r\ndifferent places in the West. A very large council, was held at or near\r\nDetroit, which embraced in it deputations from the most distant tribes. A\r\nstrong deputation was sent from the Senecas, with Red Jacket at its head.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of this council a question arose as to precedence in\r\ndebate, which is said to have been the occasion of one of Red Jacket's\r\nmost effective and brilliant speeches, and was the means of securing for\r\nhimself and fellow delegates, the high position he ever claimed, as\r\nbelonging rightfully to his nation.\r\n\r\nThe right of precedence was claimed by the Wyandots, a large and powerful\r\nnation, which for a long time, had been pre-eminent among the Western\r\ntribes. To them had been committed for preservation and safe keeping, the\r\nGreat Belt, the symbol of a previous union among the tribes. It had been\r\nused in gathering them to form their league, to resist the settlements of\r\nthe whites north and west of the Ohio river. The concert of action among\r\nthe Indians, in the wars at the West between 1790 and 1795, is to be\r\ntraced to this league. To the Wyandots also had been given the original\r\nduplicate of the treaty of peace, concluded at Greenville in 1795.\r\n\r\nHence the claim they presented to precedence at this council; a claim\r\nwhich was eloquently supported by their most able chiefs.\r\n\r\nThis claim was denied by Red Jacket, who maintained that the place in\r\nquestion belonged rightfully to the Senecas, and sustained his position by\r\na reference to facts and usages in the past, which displayed a minute and\r\naccurate knowledge of the history of the different Indian tribes, that\r\nsurprised as well as delighted his hearers. His speech was characterized\r\nthroughout by great ability, and displayed such a power of oratory,\r\nparticularly of invective, as to excite the wonder of all present, who\r\ncould understand his language, and comprehend the force of his allusions.\r\nHis effort was entirely successful. No attempt was made at reply. The\r\nfirst rank after this, without further hesitation, was given to the\r\nSenecas.\r\n\r\nIt is due to the memory of Red Jacket, who has been, called _double\r\ntongued and deceitful_, to state that from the time he fully gave his\r\nadherence, he never swerved from his allegiance to the United States. Ever\r\nafterward he was their faithful friend and ally. The impatient affirmation\r\nof Brant, that \"Red Jacket had vowed fidelity to the United States, and\r\nsealed his promise, by kissing the likeness of General Washington,\" though\r\nin a measure true, as expressive of his fidelity, had never any occasion\r\nto be qualified, by a statement to the contrary.\r\n\r\nDuring the present council, his views were in opposition to those\r\ngenerally entertained and expressed, and no consideration availed with\r\nhim, to break faith with the United States. He had before this notified\r\nthe Indian agent of the formation of another league, and of the avowedly\r\nwarlike purpose of certain Indian councils, that had been held at the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1810, at the head of a delegation of his people and\r\naccompanied by the agent, and Captain Parrish as interpreter, he visited\r\nthe city of Washington, and informed our government of the hostilities\r\nthat were in contemplation, and of the efforts of his people to secure\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThe pacific councils of Red Jacket were of little avail. The warlike\r\nagitation was continued. The retreat of the Prophet on the banks of the\r\nWabash, became not less noted for warlike exercises, than for its\r\nreligious harangues. The minds of the Indians were already ripe for an\r\noutbreak, whenever a sufficient pretext should offer. The visit of\r\nTecumseh at Vincennes in the summer of 1810, with three hundred well armed\r\nwarriors, and his haughty and insulting bearing toward Governor Harrison,\r\nindicated clearly, the hostile spirit that was rife among them.\r\n\r\nNot long after this, the report came that a thousand warriors awaited his\r\ncommand, in and about the Prophet's town. So large a horde of Indians\r\ntogether, without the means of support, and practicing themselves in the\r\narts of war, were viewed with suspicion. Charity must have been blind, to\r\nhave supposed they were assembled merely for the purpose of devotion.\r\nFrequent plundering, midnight arson, and occasional massacres in frontier\r\nsettlements, proclaimed the fact, that hostilities had already commenced,\r\nand that our people in this region needed protection.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were greatly encouraged in their warlike feeling, by the\r\nintercourse they constantly maintained with the British Indian Department.\r\nThe British Fur Company also by her traders, had correspondence with the\r\nleading men of all these Western and North-western tribes, and this\r\nintercourse resulted in holding the Indians more firmly, in alliance with\r\nthe English. The desire they entertained for dominion on this continent,\r\nled them to encourage the Indians, in their effort to hold in check the\r\nsettlements of the United States, that were pushing their way westward.\r\nThus countenanced and encouraged, the Indians became more determined and\r\nbold in their hostility.\r\n\r\nThese threatening indications, coming to the knowledge of our government,\r\nGeneral Harrison was directed to go with an armed force to the Prophet's\r\ntown, and his visit resulted in the battle of Tippecanoe, fought on the\r\nseventh of November, 1811.\r\n\r\nHis officers desired him to attack the town on the day before, but wishing\r\nto avoid fighting if possible, and having been met by several chiefs, who\r\ndisclaimed having hostile intentions, and offered submission and peace, he\r\nmade a careful survey of the country, and selecting an advantageous\r\nposition, encamped for the night.\r\n\r\nAt an early hour in the morning they were furiously assailed by the\r\nIndians, who had stealthily crept up very near without being observed. A\r\nbloody and, for a time doubtful, engagement ensued, but at length the\r\nIndians were repulsed and a decisive victory gained.\r\n\r\nThe Prophet was securely stationed on an adjoining eminence during the\r\nbattle, and the American bullets having a more powerful effect upon the\r\nIndians than they had been led to anticipate, a runner was sent to him\r\nwith the intelligence. He was engaged singing very piously, one of his old\r\nwar songs. When told what was taking place, he said, \"Go,--fight on: it\r\nwill soon be as I have said;\" and commenced singing again more loudly.\r\n[Footnote: The Prophet had assured them that the Americans would not be\r\nsuccessful. That their bullets would not hurt the Indians, who would have\r\nlight while their enemies would be in darkness.--Life and Times of Wm. H.\r\nHarrison.]\r\n\r\nTecumseh was absent when the battle was fought, being engaged in\r\nforwarding his designs among the Indian tribes at the South. He was\r\ndisappointed and grieved with the result, regarding the battle as\r\npremature, and tending very much to thwart the purposes he had in view.\r\n\r\nHe awaited a more favorable turn in the wheel of fortune, and thought this\r\nwould come with the war anticipated between England and the United States.\r\nDifficulties, growing out of the right assumed by the former, of boarding\r\nAmerican vessels, to discover and remove any English sailors belonging to\r\nthe crew, which frequently resulted in seizing American seamen and forcing\r\nthem into the British navy, had now assumed so formidable an aspect, as to\r\ncall forth from our government a proclamation of war against England,\r\nissued on the 19th of June, 1812.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of this event, as well as after it, means were employed by\r\nthe agents of Britain, to secure the services of the Indians during this\r\ncontest. The opportunity was gladly welcomed by the Miamis, Shawnees and\r\nother Indian tribes, who had recently been severely chastised by General\r\nHarrison. The Mohawks and other Indians in Canada were also induced to\r\ntake up the hatchet, and efforts were made to influence such of the Six\r\nNations, as resided within the state of New York, to take sides with the\r\nBritish in this war, but they were not successful.\r\n\r\nThe United States, instead of seeking among the Indians recruits for their\r\narmy, advised the Senecas, and other tribes of the Iroquois within their\r\nborders, to remain neutral. A council was convened by the Indian agent,\r\nMr. Erastus Granger, for the purpose of spreading the whole matter before\r\nthem. It resulted in securing from them a pledge of neutrality. So well\r\nconvinced were they of the wisdom of this course, they determined to send\r\na deputation of their brethren to Canada, to dissuade them if possible,\r\nfrom taking any part in the war. It was sent, but did not accomplish the\r\nend desired; the Mohawks had fully resolved upon engaging in the contest.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult however, for the Senecas to enforce their decision upon\r\ntheir young braves, who were made restless by the sound of war, and were\r\neager to engage in it; yet their sympathies were with the United States.\r\nThe stirring music, martial array, noise and pomp of war, wrought so\r\neffectually on their minds, they would fain have persuaded their nation to\r\ndeclare war on their own account. The circulation among them of a rumor\r\nthat the British had taken possession of Grand Island, a part of their own\r\ndomain, led them to convene a council, which Mr. Granger was invited to\r\nattend, and after stating the case to him, Red Jacket declared the purpose\r\nof the Senecas in the following language:--\r\n\r\n\"BROTHER: You have told us, that we have nothing to do with the war, that\r\nhas taken place between you and the British. But we find that the war has\r\ncome to our doors. Our property is taken possession of, by the British and\r\ntheir Indian friends. It is necessary for us now to take up the business,\r\ndefend our property, and drive the enemy from it. If we sit still upon our\r\nseats, and take no means of redress, the British according to the customs\r\nof you white people, will hold it by conquest. And should you conquer the\r\nCanadas, you will claim it on the same principle, as though you had\r\nconquered it from the British. We therefore request permission to go with\r\nour warriors, and drive off those bad people, and take possession of our\r\nlands.\"\r\n\r\nTheir request was granted, and the chiefs regarding themselves as an\r\nindependent nation, issued a formal declaration of war, against the\r\nprovinces of Upper and Lower Canada, and summoned their warriors to\r\nprotect their rights and liberties, with the Americans.\r\n\r\nFour hundred warriors, armed and painted, and ready for the field,\r\nanswered to this call, led by the brave though now aged Farmer's Brother,\r\nwho was said by Colonel Worth, to have been \"the noblest Indian in form\r\nand mould, in carriage and in soul, of that generation of his race.\"\r\n[Footnote: Col. Worth as given by Col. Stone.]\r\n\r\nThe principal scene of war at this time was on our north-western frontier.\r\nIts commencement had been disastrous. The capture of Mackinaw, Chicago,\r\nand Detroit, attended by the surrender of General Hull, commander of the\r\nAmerican forces at the latter place, spread a feeling of insecurity and\r\ndismay all along our western frontier settlements. For an immense extent\r\nthey were without protection. But new troops were raised and brought on to\r\nthe field, under the wise conduct of General Harrison, and the signal\r\nnaval victory of Commodore Perry on Lake Erie, September 10, 1813, and the\r\nequally decisive battle on the river Thames, in the October following,\r\nvery materially improved the prospect of the American arms. After this\r\nbattle, the Western Indians were disposed to entertain propositions of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThus far they had proved to be efficient allies of the British, increasing\r\ntheir force by an addition of nearly eighteen hundred, commanded by the\r\nrenowned Tecumseh, who had been called the \"Indian Bonaparte.\" His pre-\r\neminence among them was now widely acknowledged, and he swayed by his\r\ninfluence a greater number of warriors, than any Indian of his time.\r\nBefore engaging in the Battle of the Thames, he seemed to have a\r\npresentiment of his death. He said to the chiefs about him, \"brother\r\nwarriors, we are about to enter into an engagement from which I shall\r\nnever come out,--my body will remain on the field of battle.\" [Footnote:\r\nLife of Tecumseh, by Benjamin Drake.]\r\n\r\nHis prediction was verified; as marking the field of strife where the\r\nAmericans were victorious, the ashes of this celebrated warrior here\r\nrepose, near the borders of a willow marsh, the willow and the wild rose\r\nweaving a chaplet over his grave.\r\n\r\nThe Indians who had volunteered their services in the American army, were\r\nfirst employed in the gallant defense made at Black Rock, during the month\r\nof July, of this same year, 1813.\r\n\r\nA surprise party from the British head-quarters at Lundy's Lane, was sent\r\nagainst the American stores, collected at Black Rock and at Buffalo, and\r\nwere not at this time strongly guarded. They were successful in their\r\nfirst attempt, but were in turn unexpectedly met by the adroit management\r\nof General Porter, under whose supervision the forces in this vicinity had\r\nbeen placed, who rallied volunteers at Buffalo, turned back the retreating\r\ngarrison, and by a well planned attack, succeeded in driving the enemy\r\nfrom the post they had taken a short time before.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were soon after in another engagement, in the vicinity of Fort\r\nGeorge, and from an official report made at the time, it appears that this\r\nformed a part of Red Jacket's military experience. A company of volunteers\r\nand Indians commanded by Major Chapin, to which was added a force of about\r\ntwo hundred regulars under Major Cummings, amounting in all to about five\r\nhundred, the whole being under the direction of General Porter, proceeded\r\nto attack the British and Indian encampment, and were entirely successful.\r\n\r\nIn an official statement of this affair given by General Boyd, then\r\ncommanding the post at St. George, he says:--\"Those who participated in\r\nthis contest, particularly the Indians, conducted with great bravery and\r\nactivity. General Porter volunteered in the affair, and Major Chapin\r\nevinced his accustomed zeal and courage. The principal chiefs who led the\r\nwarriors this day were Farmer's Brother, Red Jacket, Little Billy,\r\nPollard, Black Smoke, Johnson, Silver Heels, Captain Half Town, Major\r\nHenry O'Bail, and Captain Cold, who was wounded. In a council held with\r\nthem yesterday, they covenanted not to scalp or murder; and I am happy to\r\nsay, that they treated the prisoners with humanity, and committed no\r\nwanton cruelties on the dead.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTaking of Fort Erie--Battle of Chippewa--Service rendered by the Indians--\r\nGeneral Porter's account of the campaign--Red Jacket commended--Withdrawal\r\nof Indian forces--Other successes--Conclusion of peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nDirectly across from Buffalo, at the head of Niagara river, on the Canada\r\nside, stood Fort Erie. Chippewa, at that time head-quarters of the British\r\narmy, was eighteen miles below, on the same side. Fort Erie was garrisoned\r\nby about one hundred and seventy men; at Chippewa and within available\r\ndistances from it, was stationed the principal part of the British force\r\nin this region.\r\n\r\nThe plan with which it was proposed to open the campaign of 1814,\r\ncontemplated an attack on both of these places.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of the previous year, though favorable in a good degree, did\r\nnot close with entire success to the American arms. The idea was\r\nentertained of descending the St. Lawrence, with a view of capturing\r\nMontreal, a design which signally failed. Taking advantage of the feeble\r\ndefense of our frontier, by the withdrawal of the regular troops for the\r\npurpose named, the enemy, on the 18th of December, surprised and took Fort\r\nNiagara, and sweeping along our frontier settlements on the Niagara river,\r\nravaged the country by fire and sword, as they passed rapidly on, carrying\r\nthe works at Lewiston, and Manchester, and laying in ashes the thriving\r\nvillages of Black Rock and Buffalo. They burned also without opposition, a\r\nvillage of the Tuscaroras.\r\n\r\nThe voice of Red Jacket was thereupon heard, arousing his people again, to\r\nthe necessity of taking up arms. And as the result, about six hundred\r\nwarriors, mostly from the Seneca nation, were in readiness to offer their\r\nservices, at the opening of the present campaign.\r\n\r\nBuffalo was the appointed place of rendezvous, and on the first of July,\r\nGeneral Brown, who commanded our forces, regarding them as sufficient to\r\nwarrant the commencement of the plan of operations, began by\r\nreconnoitering Fort Erie. During the night of the second of July, General\r\nRipley, with a part of his brigade, embarked in boats, with a view of\r\nlanding on the opposite shore, one mile above the Fort, at about day break\r\nthe next morning.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott with his brigade was to cross the Niagara river, through a\r\ndifficult pass in the Black Rock Rapids, and make a simultaneous landing\r\nbelow the fort. The two brigades enclosing the fort, could prevent the\r\nescape of the garrison, until artillery to reduce it, should be brought\r\nfrom Buffalo.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott with his usual promptness, made good his landing, and was on\r\nthe ground at the hour appointed, and by the aid of a few Indians and\r\nvolunteers who accompanied him as guides, invested the fort, so as to\r\nsecure its garrison. General Ripley though prompt in his departure, was\r\ndelayed in reaching his position, by a dense fog which misled his pilots.\r\n\r\nAs the sun rose the British commandant and his officers, could see the\r\nbusy operations going on in ferrying across from Buffalo, artillery,\r\nIndians and soldiers, with their various preparations of war. They\r\ndiscovered also how completely they were invested. At the demand of\r\nGeneral Brown, without firing a gun or making any attempt at resistance,\r\nthe fort and garrison were surrendered.\r\n\r\nThis part of their enterprise being accomplished, they next turned their\r\nthoughts toward Chippewa.\r\n\r\nThe Chippewa or Welland river, is a considerable stream not far from one\r\nhundred yards wide, and from twelve to twenty feet deep, entering the\r\nNiagara at right angles, as it flows in from the west.\r\n\r\nOn the north or left bank of this stream, near its mouth, the British army\r\nhad its station and defenses, consisting of two block houses, connected\r\nand flanked by a parapet.\r\n\r\nStreet's creek was two miles above, or south of this, a small sluggish\r\nstream, which enters the Niagara in a direction parallel with the\r\nChippewa. The mouth of this creek was selected by the American commanders,\r\nas affording a favorable position for their army before the battle.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the same day of the capture of Fort Erie, General Scott\r\nwith his brigade and Towson's artillery, proceeded down the river on his\r\nway toward Chippewa, and on the morning of the fourth, encamped in the\r\nopen field, on the south side of Street's creek, having driven in some\r\nadvanced posts of the enemy. In the evening he was joined by General\r\nBrown, with General Ripley's brigade, which took post in the same field,\r\nin rear of General Scott.\r\n\r\nGeneral Porter with the Indians, and Pennsylvania volunteers, crossed the\r\nNiagara at Black Rock during the night of the fourth, and on the morning\r\nof the fifth, marched for the camp, arriving there at about noon.\r\n\r\nThe two armies nearly equal in numbers, and well qualified by their\r\nthorough equipments, and the skill of their commanders, to harm each other\r\neffectually, were now encamped with only two miles, and the two streams,\r\non whose banks they rested, between them.\r\n\r\nBut though thus near, intervening objects prevented their seeing each\r\nother. Between them was a strip of woodland about one-fourth of a mile in\r\nwidth, extending from the forest on the west, near to the bank of the\r\nriver, where it was cleared for the public highway. This effectually shut\r\nout from the view of the other, the manoeuvres of each army.\r\n\r\nThe Indians and militia from the British army infested these woods, and\r\nbecame annoying to our forces. General Porter being well acquainted with\r\nthe country, and having charge of the Indians, was requested to take them,\r\nand a part of his Pennsylvania volunteers, and dislodge this portion of\r\nthe enemy; General Brown assuring him, that none of the British regulars\r\nwould be found south of the Chippewa on that day, and promising him in\r\ncase of so improbable a contingency, the support of General Scott's\r\nbrigade.\r\n\r\nAt about three o'clock of the same day of his arrival, General Porter\r\nformed his men, half a mile in rear of the main camp, into single or\r\nIndian file, placing the Indians on the left, and a part of the\r\nPennsylvanians on the right.\r\n\r\n\"Thence he marched into the woods in the same order, in a line at right\r\nangles to the river, until the whole Indian force was immerged in the\r\nforest, leaving the white troops in the open field; they had only to halt\r\nand face to the right, when the whole were formed in line of battle,\r\nthree-fourths of a mile long and one man deep, looking in the direction\r\nof Chippewa. Red Jacket was placed on the extreme left of the line, and\r\nGeneral Porter took his station on the margin of the woods between his\r\nwhite and red troops, accompanied by Captain Pollard, a Seneca chief, who,\r\nin this campaign, was considered first in command among the Indians;\r\nColonel Flemming, the Quarter-master of the Indian corps, Lieutenant\r\nDonald Fraser his aid, and Henry Johnson his interpreter. He was also\r\naccompanied by Major Jones, and Major Wood of the Engineers, as\r\nvolunteers; and was supported by a company of regular infantry, marching\r\nin column in rear, as a reserve.\r\n\r\n\"The Indians were commanded by their war-chiefs, who were indulged in\r\ntheir own mode of conducting the attack, marching about twenty yards in\r\nadvance of the warriors of their respective tribes. General Porter having\r\nsent out scouts to reconnoiter the enemy, the march was commenced by\r\nsignal, and proceeded at first with great stillness and caution. The\r\nchiefs have signals, by which, on the discovery of any circumstance\r\nrequiring consultation, or change of route or action, they convey notice\r\nthrough their ranks with great celerity, on which the whole line of\r\nwarriors drop instantly on the ground, and remain there until further\r\norders. Two manoeuvres of this kind occurred on the march, the first of\r\nlittle moment, but the second communicating through the scouts, the exact\r\nposition of the enemy, who, apprised of their assailants' approach, lay\r\nconcealed in a thicket of bushes, along the margin of Street's creek.\r\n\r\n\"A consultation was thereupon held, and new orders given, the purport of\r\nwhich was to change the line of march, so as to meet the enemy to more\r\nadvantage, to increase the speed as much as was consistent with the\r\npreservation of order, and to receive their first fire, but not to return\r\nit except singly, and when it could be done with certain effect, and then\r\nto raise the war-whoop, pursue, capture, and slay as many as practicable,\r\nuntil they should reach the open ground in front of Chippewa, and thence\r\nreturn to camp.\r\n\r\n\"The march was accordingly resumed, the fire of the enemy received, and a\r\nrush accompanied with savage yells made upon them, and continued for more\r\nthan a mile, through scenes of frightful havoc and slaughter, few only of\r\nthe fugitives offering to surrender as prisoners, while others, believing\r\nthat no quarter would be given, suffered themselves to be cut down with\r\nthe tomahawk, or turning back upon their pursuers, fought hand to hand to\r\nthe last.\r\n\r\n\"On reaching the open field in front of Chippewa, the assailants were met\r\nby a tremendous discharge of musketry, by which the warriors, who were\r\nprincipally in front, were thrown back upon the volunteers and reserve,\r\nwho for want of equal speed were a short distance in the rear. Presuming\r\nthat the fire had come from the enemy he had been pursuing, and who had\r\nrallied on reaching the open ground, General Porter made an effort, not\r\nwithout success, to reform his line with volunteers, reserve and a portion\r\nof the warriors; but on again advancing to the margin of the woods, found\r\nhimself within a few yards of the whole British regular army, formed in\r\nline of battle, and presenting within a given space at least three men\r\nfresh from their camp, to a single one in his own attenuated and exhausted\r\nline. After receiving and returning two or three fires, the enemy rushed\r\nforward with charged bayonets, when hearing nothing from General Scott, he\r\ngave the order to retreat and form again on the left of General Scott's\r\nbrigade, wherever it should be found.\r\n\r\n\"It appears that the British commander had resolved on making a general\r\nattack, that day, on the American camp; and in execution of this purpose\r\nhad marched his whole force across the Chippewa, a short time before\r\nGeneral Porter entered the woods with the Indians; and having sent forward\r\nhis Indians and militia, which was the British force met in the woods, to\r\ncommence his attack on the left flank of the Americans, formed in the\r\nmeantime his battalions of regulars on the plain, under cover of the strip\r\nof woodland which divided the two camps, with his artillery on his left,\r\nnear the gorge occupied by the road along the bank of the river; ready to\r\nact the moment the effect of the flank attack should be developed.\r\n\r\n\"The repulse of General Porter's command was thus effected by the main\r\nbody of the British army, while General Scott's brigade was more than a\r\nmile in the rear, and had not yet crossed the bridge over Street's\r\ncreek.... In a retreat of a mile in a diagonal direction to the right, so\r\nas to uncover the enemy to the fire of the American line, then just\r\nbeginning to form, they gained but little distance on the British columns,\r\nwho were in hot pursuit. When General Porter and his staff arrived at\r\nStreet's creek, they were met by Major Jessup's battalion, then in the act\r\nof taking its position, which was on the left, and a short distance from\r\nthe remainder of General Scott's brigade; and the volunteers fatigued as\r\nthey were, aided Major Jessup's evolutions, which were executed with great\r\norder and celerity, by breaking down the fences to enable him to pass from\r\nthe road bordering on Street's creek, to his position in the field.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing could exceed the coolness and order with which General Scott's\r\nbrigade crossed the bridge and formed its line, under the galling fire of\r\nthe enemy's artillery, and the headlong approach of his infantry, who,\r\nwhen only fifty yards distant, were received by a tremendous discharge of\r\nmusketry from the American line, which forced them to fall back for a\r\nconsiderable distance. But they speedily rallied and advanced again, when\r\nthey were met in the same gallant manner; and they thereupon fled, with as\r\nmuch precipitation as they had entered it, not halting until they had\r\nrecrossed the Chippewa and destroyed their bridge.\r\n\r\n\"General Scott pursued them around the point of woods, beyond which he\r\ncould only advance in face of their batteries, and these he could not\r\nreach by reason of the intervening river. He therefore deployed to the\r\nleft, and forming a line in the open field, in front of Chippewa, directed\r\nhis men to lie down with their heads toward the batteries, the better to\r\navoid the effect of their fire.\r\n\r\n\"The battle between the regular troops, was but of a few minutes duration,\r\nwith the exception of the artillery, which on both sides was earliest and\r\nlongest engaged, and served with the most destructive effect; Colonel\r\nTowson occupying the right of the American line, on Street's creek, and\r\nthe British artillery the left of theirs, at the point of woods, and both\r\ncommencing with the first movements of the regular troops.\r\n\r\n\"Immediately after the two lines had encountered on Street's creek, a\r\nmagnificent charger completely caparisoned, but without a rider, was seen\r\nprancing and curveting in the centre of the battle field, and endeavoring\r\nto make his escape through the American line to the rear. Presuming that\r\nhe belonged to some officer who had fallen, he was forthwith secured by\r\nthe servant of General Porter, and immediately mounted by the General, to\r\nwhom he was a most acceptable acquisition, after the labors of the day,\r\nwhich he had performed on foot.\r\n\r\n\"Riding up to General Brown, who was also in the midst of the action,\r\nGeneral Porter received his orders to march with the two hundred\r\nPennsylvanians, who had been left in camp, to the support of General\r\nScott; which orders were promptly executed by following General Scott's\r\nbrigade around the point of woods, receiving the fire of the British\r\nbatteries, and taking post on his left, with the men in the same recumbent\r\nposition. Here they awaited the arrival of General Ripley's brigade, which\r\non the first discovery that the whole British army was in the field, had\r\nbeen ordered to make a detour through the woods, and attack the enemy's\r\nright. They soon came up, in the same muddy plight with the volunteers and\r\nIndians, who had previously traversed the same ground; when the whole army\r\nat about sundown quietly retired to their camp, on the south side of\r\nStreet's creek.\r\n\r\n\"And thus ended the battle of Chippewa, which probably produced more\r\nimportant results in favor of the American arms, than any other engagement\r\nby land in the course of that war; although there were several battles\r\nfought on the Niagara, if not elsewhere, during the same campaign,\r\nexhibiting a greater number of combatants engaged, a larger number of\r\nslain, and a result equally creditable to the gallantry and good conduct\r\nof the American soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"The first advantage gained was in driving from the British army those\r\ntroublesome enemies, their Indian allies, who had been the terror of our\r\ntroops in the west, during all the preceding stages of the war, and had\r\nkept the camps of General Dearborn, General Lewis, and General Boyd, in a\r\nperpetual panic during the campaign of 1813. Terrified and disheartened by\r\nthe reception they met with at Chippewa, they fled from the battle field\r\nto the head of Lake Ontario, a distance of thirty miles, without halting,\r\nand never again during the remainder of the war appeared in the British\r\ncamp.\" [Footnote: Colonel Stone's Life and Times of Red Jacket. Mr. Stone\r\nrefers to General Porter, as his authority, representing him as having\r\nvoluntarily prepared the account given of this campaign.]\r\n\r\nThe Indians during this engagement performed a most important service.\r\nTheir conduct was highly commended by General Porter. Speaking of those\r\nunder his command, General Porter says: \"The great body of warriors as\r\nwell as volunteers, engaged in the opening attack, fought with boldness,\r\nnot to say desperation, unsurpassed by any other troops, until they were\r\nplaced in a situation where it would have been madness not to retreat.\"\r\n\r\nThe part Red Jacket took in this battle, though by no means conspicuous,\r\nwas such as to call forth from an early biographer the affirmation, that\r\n\"he displayed the most undaunted intrepidity, and completely redeemed his\r\ncharacter from the suspicion of that unmanly weakness, with which he had\r\nbeen charged in early life; while in no instance did he exhibit the\r\nferocity of the savage, or disgrace himself, by any act of outrage towards\r\na prisoner, or a fallen enemy.\"\r\n\r\nThe same writer adds: \"His therefore was that true moral courage, which\r\nresults from self respect, and the sense of duty, and which is more noble,\r\nand a more active principle, than that mere animal instinct which renders\r\nmany men insensible to danger. Opposed to war, not ambitious of martial\r\nfame, and unskilled in military affairs, he went to battle from principle,\r\nand met its perils with the spirit of a veteran warrior, while he shrunk\r\nfrom its cruelties with the sensibility of a man and of a philosopher.\"\r\n[Footnote: Life of Red Jacket. McKenny's Indian Biography.]\r\n\r\nRed Jacket as a civil officer was not called to take so prominent a place\r\non the field of battle, as the war chiefs. Yet in all of their\r\ndeliberations, which were frequent during the campaign, he could act as\r\ntheir counsellor, as he did on every such occasion. He was uniformly their\r\nprincipal orator, and his manner on these occasions is represented as\r\nbeing \"graceful and imposing in the eye of every beholder, and his voice\r\nmusic, especially in the ears of his own people. He had the power of\r\nwielding them at will, and the soul stirring trumpet could not produce a\r\nmore kindling effect in the bosoms of a disciplined army, than would his\r\nappeals upon the warriors of his race.\" [Footnote: Col. Stone's Life of\r\nRed Jacket.]\r\n\r\nThat the battle of Chippewa was particularly severe to the Indian forces\r\nengaged in it, may be inferred from the fact that the British Indians\r\nretreated not only beyond the Chippewa, but stayed not until they had gone\r\nthirty miles further. The battle ground was strewed with many of their\r\nnumber who had been slain. Two, who had been mortally wounded, and were\r\nstill alive, were despatched by a party of New York Indians, who were\r\nlooking for the bodies of their fallen friends. Being reproached for their\r\nconduct in taking the life of an unresisting foe, one of them replied, in\r\na manner that indicated evident sorrow for the deed done, \"That it did\r\nseem hard to take the lives of these men, but they should remember that\r\nthese were very hard times.\" [Footnote: Col. Stone.]\r\n\r\nThe sight of slain warriors was far from being a pleasing object for Red\r\nJacket to behold, and having ever been opposed to his people engaging in\r\ncontests that did not really concern them, he proposed now that the\r\nIndians had helped chastise the British for burning one of their villages,\r\nand as they were no longer on Indian ground, that they should withdraw\r\nfrom a further participation in the war, in case they could prevail on\r\ntheir Canadian brethren to do the same.\r\n\r\nWith the consent and approval of General Brown, a deputation of two brave\r\nand influential chiefs was sent to the Indians, who had fought with the\r\nBritish, with this in view. They were successful in persuading them to\r\nenter into this arrangement. The Indians therefore after this retired to\r\ntheir villages, with the exception of a few young braves, with whom the\r\nlove of war, was a more potent influence, than the counsels of the aged\r\nand more considerate of their nation.\r\n\r\nSoon after the battle, our army forced a passage across the Chippewa, and\r\nafter a short engagement the enemy gave way, and retired to Lake Ontario.\r\nOur army continued its march down the Niagara river, destroying some of\r\nthe British works on their way.\r\n\r\nWith new forces brought into the field, General Drummond took command of\r\nthe British, and on the 25th of July the two armies met again, and there\r\nwas a hard fought, but not very decisive battle, at Lundy's Lane, near\r\nNiagara Falls. The American army soon after fell back to Fort Erie. A\r\nBritish force of five thousand advanced and laid siege to the Fort, making\r\na vigorous assault on the 15th of August. They were repulsed with a loss\r\nof a thousand men. Later, General Brown issued from the fort and gave them\r\nso stunning a blow as caused them to relinquish the siege.\r\n\r\nOther successful engagements during the year, ending with the signal\r\nvictory at New Orleans under General Jackson, inspired greatly the hopes\r\nof the American people, and served likewise to repress the ardor of their\r\nopponents; which led to the return of peace with England, which was\r\nconcluded at Ghent on the 24th of December, 1814.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nPre-emptive right to the Indian Reservations sold to Ogden and Company--\r\nCouncil to obtain the lands--Mr. Ogden's speech--Red Jacket's reply--\r\nIndians refuse to sell--Another Council called--Account of it by Hon.\r\nAlbert Tracy--Various utterances of the orator on that occasion--Indians'\r\nappeal to the governments of the United States and New York--Noble\r\nresponse of Governor De Witt Clinton of New York--Final success of the\r\nOgden Company.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough the Indian lands within the state of New York, had now been\r\nnarrowed down to a comparatively small compass, there were not wanting\r\nthose who would take from them, the remaining portion of their ancient\r\ninheritance. The preemptive right to their reservations was sold by the\r\nHolland Land Company, to Colonel Aaron Ogden and others, who were known as\r\nthe Ogden Company. The efforts of these gentlemen to induce the Indians to\r\ndispose of their reservations, resulted in calling several Indian\r\ncouncils, at which Red Jacket was the prominent speaker, and in which the\r\nentire force of his great powers was summoned, to withstand and thwart\r\ntheir endeavors.\r\n\r\nA council for this purpose was convened at their village near Buffalo,\r\nduring the summer of 1819. The Hon. Morris S. Miller of Oneida, was\r\npresent as a commissioner on the part of the United States; and the Hon.\r\nNathaniel Gorham of Canandaigua, represented the interests of the state of\r\nMassachusetts. Captain Parrish of Canandaigua, and Captain Horatio Jones\r\nof Genesee, were present as interpreters.\r\n\r\nAs it was known Red Jacket was to speak in opposition to the interests of\r\nthe Land Company, the occasion drew together a large concourse of people;\r\npale faces as well as red, who were interested in the result of the\r\nnegotiations contemplated, as also by a desire to hear the speech of the\r\ndistinguished orator of the Senecas. Of this Colonel Stone remarks: \"No\r\nsubsequent assemblage of the Indians within the state of New York, has\r\npresented so numerous and imposing an array, nor is it likely that so many\r\nof them will ever again meet, on the soil of their fathers.\"\r\n\r\nA gentleman who was present at this treaty by the invitation of a friend,\r\nspeaks of it, in the following terms:--\"My friend and myself having\r\narrived on the ground at an early hour; we saw at a little distance from\r\nthe wigwams, a group of Indians, under the shade of a cluster of plum\r\ntrees, lying on the ground. Among these were a number of chiefs, of whom\r\nin a conspicuous place, was Red Jacket, apparently in deep thought, with a\r\npile of little small sticks, two or three inches long, before him.\r\n\r\n\"I inquired of a gentleman who was conversant with Indian proceedings,\r\nwhat Red Jacket was doing? He replied that he was studying his speech, and\r\nadvised us to retire, as he perceived it disturbed him. About this time\r\nthe commissioners, Governor Ogden, his friends, and the two celebrated\r\nIndian interpreters, Parrish and Jones, and a large concourse of people,\r\ngentlemen and ladies, began to assemble under another cluster of trees,\r\nwhere benches had been prepared in two parallel lines, with a wide space\r\nbetween, and seats across the upper end, for the commissioners. The long\r\nseats were occupied on the right by Messrs. Ogden, their officers, and\r\nother gentlemen and ladies; the left by Red Jacket, a large number of\r\nchiefs, and other Indians.\r\n\r\n\"There was order, dignity, and perfect silence. The contest soon\r\ncommenced. Governor Ogden, a dignified, fine looking man, rose and opened\r\nthe case. Mr. Parrish, a man of large stature, stood up at the same time,\r\nand interpreted it to the Indians, sentence by sentence.\" [Footnote:\r\nAuthor's Scrap Book.]\r\n\r\nThe object was to buy the Indian title, as they had already brought the\r\npre-emptive right. Governor Ogden told them it was the wish of their great\r\nFather, the President of the United States, that they should sell these\r\nlands, and go down to a reservation on the Allegany river, where they\r\ncould live in peace, and have a good foothold forever; and used various\r\narguments in favor of such a course.\r\n\r\nAfter Governor Ogden had finished his speech, Red Jacket rose with a great\r\ndeal of composure, and adjusting his belt of handsome wampum, and looking\r\nto the sky for a moment spoke. Mr. Parrish interpreted: \"Red Jacket says\r\nhe thanks the Great Spirit that we are all alive and here this pleasant\r\nday.\" He then addressed the commissioners, answering all the statements\r\nand arguments of Governor Ogden in their order, unfolding a long roll of\r\nparchments attached together, of treaties that had been made at different\r\ntimes by the United States, with the Six Nations. They had been preserved\r\nin good order. He pointed to the dates, and to the substance of the\r\ntreaties from time to time, with great accuracy, as appeared from the\r\ninterpretation, answering Governor Ogden with the most forcible arguments,\r\ninterspersed with wit and humor. His speech on this occasion, as quoted by\r\nCol. Stone, is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Brother: We understand that you have been appointed by our great Father,\r\nthe President, to make these communications to us. We thank the Great\r\nSpirit for this pleasant day given us for our reply, and we beg you to\r\nlisten.\r\n\r\n\"BROTHER: Previous to your arrival at this council fire, we were told that\r\nour great Father had appointed a commissioner to meet us. You have\r\nproduced your commission, and it has been read and explained to us. You\r\nhave also explained the object of your mission, and the wishes of the\r\nPresident in sending you to the council fire of the Six Nations. We do not\r\ndoubt that the sealed document you produced, contained the words of the\r\nPresident, our great Father. When first informed of your appointment, we\r\nsupposed that you were coming to meet us on a very different subject.\r\nSince the war of the Revolution, we have held various councils with our\r\nwhite brothers, and in this same manner. We have made various speeches,\r\nand entered into several treaties, and these things are well known to our\r\ngreat Father; they are lodged with him. We, too, perfectly understand them\r\nall. The same interpreters were then present as now. In consequence of\r\nwhat took place during the late war, we made it known to our great Father,\r\nthrough our interpreter, that we wished to have a talk. Our application\r\nwas not complied with. We sent a messenger to brighten the chain of\r\nfriendship with our great Father, but he would not meet around the council\r\nfire, and we were disappointed. We had supposed that the commissioner he\r\nhas now sent, came forward to brighten the chain of friendship, to renew\r\nformer engagements. When we made a treaty at Canandaigua with Colonel\r\nPickering in 1794, we were told, and thought that it was to be permanent,\r\nand to be lasting, between us and the United States forever. After several\r\ntreaties had been entered into under our great Father, General Washington,\r\nlarge delegations from the Six Nations were invited to meet him. We went\r\nand met him in Philadelphia. We kindled a council fire. A treaty was then\r\nmade, and General Washington then declared that it should be permanent\r\nbetween the red and white brothers; that it should be spread out on the\r\nlargest and strongest rocks, that nothing could undermine or break; that\r\nit should be exposed to the view of all.\r\n\r\n\"BROTHER: We shall now see what has been done by the United States. After\r\nthis treaty had been formed I then said that I did not doubt, but that the\r\nUnited States would faithfully perform their engagements. But I told our\r\nwhite brothers at that time, that I feared eventually they would wish to\r\ndisturb those contracts. You white brothers have the faculty to burst the\r\nstoutest rocks. On our part we would not have disturbed those treaties.\r\nShortly after our interview with our great Father, General Washington, at\r\nPhiladelphia, a treaty was made at Canandaigua, by which we widened our\r\nformer engagements with our white brothers, and made some new ones. The\r\ncommissioner, Colonel Pickering, then told us that this treaty should be\r\nbinding and should last, without alteration for two lives. We wished to\r\nmake it extend much farther, and the Six Nations then wished to establish\r\na lasting chain of friendship. On our part, we wished the treaty to last\r\nas long as trees grow, and waters run. Our Brother told us that he would\r\nagree to it.\r\n\r\n\"BROTHER: I have reminded you of what had taken place between our\r\nconfederates, the Six Nations, and our white brothers, down to the treaty\r\nof Canandaigua. At the close of that treaty it was agreed, it being as\r\nstrong and binding, as by my former comparisons I have explained, that if\r\nany difficulty should occur, if any monster should cross the chain of\r\nfriendship, that we would unite to remove those difficulties, to drive\r\naway the monster; that we would go hand in hand and prolong the chain. So\r\nit was agreed.\r\n\r\n\"BROTHER: Many years ago we discovered a cloud rising that darkened the\r\nprospect of our peace and happiness. We heard eventful things from\r\ndifferent quarters, from different persons, and at different times, and\r\nforesaw that the period was not very distant, when this threatening cloud\r\nwould burst upon us.\r\n\r\n\"BROTHER: During the late war we intended to take no part. Yet residing\r\nwithin the limits of the United States, and with the advice of General\r\nPorter, we agreed around our council fire, that it was right, and we took\r\na part. We thought it would help to promote our friendship with our white\r\nbrothers, to aid the arms of the United States, and to make our present\r\nseats still stronger. These were our reasons. What were the results? We\r\nlost many of our warriors. We spilt our blood in a cause between you, and\r\na people not of our color.\r\n\r\n\"BROTHER: These things may be new to you, but they are not new to your\r\ngovernment. Records of these things are with our great Father, the\r\nPresident. You have come, therefore, for a very different purpose from the\r\none we expected. You come to tell us of our situation, of our\r\nreservations, of the opinion of the President that we must change our old\r\ncustoms for new ones; that we must concentrate in order to enjoy the fair\r\nmeans you offer of civilization, and improvement in the arts of\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\n\"BROTHER: At the treaty of Canandaigua, we were promised that different\r\nkinds of mechanics, blacksmiths, and carpenters, should be sent among us;\r\nand farmers with their families, that our women might learn to spin. We\r\nagreed to receive them. We even applied for these benefits. We were told\r\nthat our children were too young to be taught. Neither farmers or\r\nmechanics were sent.\r\n\r\n\"BROTHER: We had thought that the promises made by one President, were\r\nhanded down to the next. We do not change our chiefs as you do. Since\r\nthese treaties were made, you have had several Presidents. We do not\r\nunderstand why the treaty made by one, is not binding on the other. On our\r\npart we expect to comply with our engagements.\r\n\r\n\"BROTHER: You told us when the country was surrounded by whites, and in\r\npossession of Indians, that it was unproductive, not being liable to\r\ntaxes, nor to make roads nor improvements, it was time to change. As for\r\nthe taxing of Indians, this is extra-ordinary; and was never heard of,\r\nsince the settlement of America. The land is ours, by the gift of the\r\nGreat Spirit. How can you tax it? We can make such roads as we want, and\r\ndid so when the land was all ours. We are improving our condition. See\r\nthese large stocks of cattle, and those fences. We are surrounded by the\r\nwhites, from whom we can procure cattle, and whatever is necessary for our\r\nimprovement. Now that we are confined to narrow limits, we can easily make\r\nour roads, and improve our lands.\r\n\r\n\"Look back to the first settlement by the whites, and then look at our\r\npresent condition. Formerly we continued to grow in numbers, and in\r\nstrength. What has become of the Indians, who extended to the salt water?\r\nThey have been driven back and become few, while you have been growing\r\nnumerous, and powerful. This lands is ours, from the God of Heaven. It was\r\ngiven to us. We cannot make land. Driven back and reduced as we are, you\r\nwish to cramp us more and more. You tell us of a pre-emptive right. Such\r\nmen you say own one reservation, and such another. But they are all ours,\r\nours from the top to the bottom. If Mr. Ogden had come from heaven, with\r\nflesh on his bones, as I we now see him, and said that the Heavenly Father\r\nhad given him a title, we might then believe him.\r\n\r\n\"BROTHER: You say that the President has sent us word that it is for our\r\ninterest to dispose of our lands. You tell us that there is a good tract\r\nof land at Allegany. This too is very extraordinary. Our feet have covered\r\nevery inch of that reservation. A communication like this has never been\r\nmade to us, at any of our councils. The President must have been\r\ndisordered in mind, when he offered to lead us off by the arms, to the\r\nAllegany reservation. I have told you of the treaty we made with the\r\nUnited States. Here is the belt of wampum, that confirmed that treaty.\r\nHere too is the parchment. You know its contents. I will not open it. Now\r\nthe tree of friendship is decaying; its limbs are fast falling off. You\r\nare at fault.\r\n\r\n\"Formerly we called the British brothers. Now we call the President, our\r\nFather. Probably among you, are persons with families of children. We\r\nconsider ourselves the children of the President. What would be your\r\nfeelings, were you told that your children were to be cast upon a naked\r\nrock, there to protect themselves? The different claims you tell us of, on\r\nour lands, I cannot understand. We are placed here by the Great Spirit,\r\nfor purposes known to him. You have no right to interfere. You told us\r\nthat we had large and unproductive tracts of land. We do not view it so.\r\nOur seats, we consider small; and if we are left here long, by the Great\r\nSpirit, we shall stand in need of them. We shall be in want of timber.\r\nLand after many years' use wears out; our fields must be renewed, and new\r\nones improved, so that we have no more land in our reservations than we\r\nwant. Look at the white people around us, and back. You are not cramped\r\nfor lands. They are large. Look at that man. [Footnote: Mr. Ellicott,\r\nagent of the Holland Land Company.] If you want to buy, apply to him. He\r\nhas lands enough to sell. We have none to part with. You laugh, but do not\r\nthink I trifle. I am sincere. Do not think we are hasty in making up our\r\nminds. We have had many councils, and thought for a long time upon this\r\nsubject. We will not part with any, not with one of our reservations.\r\n\r\n\"We recollect that Mr. Ogden addressed his speech to you, therefore I have\r\nspoken to you. Now I will speak to Mr. Ogden.\r\n\r\n\"BROTHER: You recollect when you first came to this ground, that you told\r\nus you had bought the pre-emptive right. A right to purchase given you by\r\nthe government. Remember my reply. I told you, you had been unfortunate in\r\nbuying. You said you would not disturb us. I then told you as long as I\r\nlived, you must not come forward to explain that right. You have come. See\r\nme before you. You have heard our reply to the commissioner sent by the\r\nPresident. I again repeat that, one and all, chiefs and warriors, we are\r\nof the same mind. We will not part with any of our reservations. Do not\r\nmake your application anew, nor in any other shape. Let us hear no more of\r\nit. Let us part as we met, in friendship.\"\r\n\r\nCol. Stone refers to the kindness of Major Joseph Delafield, for the\r\nspeeches made at this council, as given in his work, and the most\r\nimportant of which is presented here; they were taken down at the time\r\nfrom the lips of the interpreter, who stated that \"he could not translate\r\nsome of Red Jacket's figurative flights, they were too wild and difficult\r\nto be rendered in English, and he did not attempt it.\" Much doubtless that\r\nserved to give point and zest to his speech, was either omitted, or lost\r\nits force, in being transferred to our language. The writer of the sketch\r\npreviously alluded to, among several points in this speech which were\r\nimpressed on his memory, mentions one not found in the above. \"The\r\ngentleman says, that our great Father says, we can go Allegany, and have a\r\ngood foothold forever; _yes, a good foothold, for it is all rock_.\"\r\n\r\nThough the efforts of the Ogden Company to obtain the consent of the\r\nIndians to sell their remaining lands, were at this time unsuccessful,\r\nthey were nevertheless repeated. The demand of Red Jacket, \"do not make\r\nyour application anew, nor in any other shape,\" was unheeded.\r\n\r\nCol. Stone, on the authority of the Hon. Albert Tracy, mentions a treaty\r\nheld for this same purpose in 1822 or 1823, in which Red Jacket replied to\r\na speech made by the commissioner, and also by Governor Ogden, entering,\r\nas in the preceding speech, upon a regular and connected history of the\r\ntransactions of the Indians with the whites, up to that time, and in the\r\ncourse of his speech, used the language very happily alluded to by Mr.\r\nBryant, in his memorial address.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the speech that has been quoted almost entire, some of his\r\npeople desired him to apologize for one or two utterances he had made,\r\nregarding them as rude, and adapted to awaken unpleasant reflections. He\r\nrefused, saying, \"NO, IT HAS GONE FORTH, LET IT STAND.\" A circumstance\r\ndoubtless alluded to, in the words which immediately follow: \"Often the\r\nfierceness of his temper, the righteous indignation that swelled his\r\nbosom, impelled him to hurl defiance at his foes, and to use language, the\r\npossible consequences of which, caused the more timid and abject of his\r\nfollowers, to tremble with apprehension. But Red Jacket would retract not\r\na single word, although a majority of the chiefs, would sometimes secretly\r\ndeprecate the severity of his utterances.\"\r\n\r\n\"Again on other occasions, sorely beset and almost despairing, he would\r\nessay to melt the hearts of the pitiless pursuers of his people, and give\r\nutterance to such touching words as these:\r\n\r\n\"We first knew you a feeble plant, which wanted a little earth whereon to\r\ngrow. We gave it to you, and afterward, when we could have trod you under\r\nour feet, we watered and protected you; and now you have grown to be a\r\nmighty tree, whose top reaches the clouds, and whose branches overspread\r\nthe whole land; whilst we, who were then the tall pine of the forest, have\r\nbecome the feeble plant and need your protection.\"\r\n\r\n\"Again assuming the pleading tones of a supplicant, he said, 'when you\r\nfirst came here, you clung around our knee, and called us FATHER. We took\r\nyou by the hand and called you BROTHERS. You have grown greater than we,\r\nso that we can no longer reach up to your hand. But we wish to cling\r\naround your knee, and be called YOUR CHILDREN.'\"\r\n\r\nIn this same speech, referring to their services during the late war with\r\nEngland, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Not long ago you raised the war-club against him, who was once our great\r\nFather over the waters. You asked us to go with you to the war. It was not\r\nour quarrel. We knew not that you were right. We asked not; we cared not;\r\nit was enough for us, that you were our brothers. We went with you to the\r\nbattle. We fought and bled for you; and now,\" his eye kindling with\r\nemotion, and the deepest feeling indicated in his utterance, as he pointed\r\nto some Indians present, that had been wounded in that contest; \"and now,\r\ndare you pretend to us, that our Father the President, while he sees our\r\nblood running, yet fresh from the wounds received, while fighting his\r\nbattles, has sent you with a message to persuade us to relinquish the poor\r\nremains of our once boundless possessions; to sell the birth place of our\r\nchildren, and the graves of our fathers! No! Sooner than believe that he\r\ngave you this message, we will believe that _you have stolen your\r\ncommission, and are a cheat and a liar_.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more, speaking of the pre-emptive right and the assurance given them\r\nthat their lands were desired only in return for a fair equivalent of\r\ntheir value, he called their attention to the great cessions the Indians\r\nhad already made, together with the solemn declarations that they should\r\nnot be importuned to relinquish their remaining reservations, he said:\r\n\"You tell us of your claim to our land, and that you have purchased it\r\nfrom your State. We know nothing of your claim, and we care nothing for\r\nit. Even the whites have a law by which they cannot sell what they do not\r\nown. How then has your State, which never owned our land, sold it to you?\r\nWe have a title to it, and we know that our title is good; for it came\r\ndirect from the Great Spirit, who gave it to us, his red children. When\r\nyou can ascend where he is,\" pointing toward the skies, \"and will get his\r\ndeed, and show it to us, then, and never till then, will we acknowledge\r\nyour title. You say you came not to cheat us of our lands, but to buy\r\nthem. Who told you that we have lands to sell? You never heard it from\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nThen rising up and giving Mr. Ogden a look of deep earnestness, if not of\r\nindignation, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Did I not tell you the last time we met, that whilst Red Jacket lived,\r\nyou would get no more lands of the Indians? How then, while you see him\r\nalive and strong,\" striking his hand violently on his breast, \"_do you\r\nthink to make him a liar?_\"\r\n\r\nThe persistence with which the Senecas were importuned to sell their\r\nlands, led them to make an appeal to the president, and afterward to the\r\ngovernor of New York.\r\n\r\nThe latter, Governor De Witt Clinton, sent them a reply worthy of his name\r\nand office. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"All the right that Ogden and his company have to your reservations, is\r\nthe right of purchasing them when you think it expedient to sell them,\r\nthat is, they can buy your lands, but no other person can. You may retain\r\nthem as long as you please, and you may sell them to Ogden as soon as you\r\nplease. You are the owners of these lands in the same way that your\r\nbrethren the Oneidas, are of their reservations. They are all that is left\r\nof what the Great Spirit gave to your ancestors. No man shall deprive you\r\nof them without your consent. The State will protect you in the full\r\nenjoyment of your property. We are strong and willing to shield you from\r\noppression. The Great Spirit looks down on the conduct of mankind, and\r\nwill punish us if we permit the remnant of the Indian nations which is\r\nwith us to be injured. We feel for you, brethren; we shall watch over your\r\ninterests. We know that in a future world we shall be called upon to\r\nanswer for our conduct to our fellow creatures.\"\r\n\r\nCol. Stone refers to the Hon. Albert H. Tracy, as having furnished the\r\nnotes of the council we have just been considering. The same authority\r\nspeaking of the eloquence of Red Jacket, says: \"It is evident that the\r\nbest translations of Indian speeches, must fail to express the beauty and\r\nsublimity of the originals; especially of such an original as Red Jacket.\r\nIt has been my good fortune to hear him a few times, but only of late\r\nyears, and when his powers were enfeebled by age, and still more, by\r\nintemperance. But I shall never forget the impression made on me, the\r\nfirst time I saw him in council:\r\n\r\n  \"Deep on his front engraven,\r\n  \"Deliberation sate, and public care,\r\n  \"And princely counsel in his face yet shone,\r\n  \"Majestic, though in ruin.\r\n\r\n\"I can give no idea of the strong impression it made on my mind, though\r\nconveyed to it through the medium of an illiterate interpreter, Even in\r\nthis mangled form, I saw the _disjecta membra_ of a regular and\r\nsplendid oration.\" [Footnote: Col. Stone's Life and Times of Red Jacket.]\r\n\r\nThe Ogden Company though defeated time and again by the watchfulness, and\r\npowerful influence of Red Jacket, continued to ply their endeavors, until\r\nby degrees, the remaining portion of their once proud inheritance, was\r\nwrested from them, and the orator was left in the decline of life to\r\nsurvey, as he often did in a spirit of dejection, the haunts of his youth,\r\nwhich had nearly all passed into other hands, through the craft and\r\navarice of the white man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nWitchcraft--Lease of Tom-Jemmy--Testimony of Red Jacket--Red Jacket's\r\nPhilippic--Finding of the court--Remarkable interview of Dr. Breckenridge\r\nwith Red Jacket--Further expression of views.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1821, a man belonging to Red Jacket's tribe, fell into a\r\nlanguishing condition, and after lingering for some time, unable to obtain\r\nrelief, died. The _medicine men_ were unable to divine the cause of\r\nhis malady; the circumstances of his sickness and death, were thought to\r\nbe very peculiar, and his friends could discover no better way of\r\nexplaining the matter, than to suppose he had been bewitched.\r\n\r\nThe Indians believed in sorcery, and at different times in their history\r\nhad been known to execute summary judgment, on those whom they supposed to\r\nbe guilty of practicing the Satanic art. In the present instance suspicion\r\nrested on the woman, by whom he had been attended, during his sickness. In\r\npursuance of the customs of their nation she was condemned to die. The\r\nsentence was executed by Soo-nong-gise, a chief, commonly called Tom-\r\nJemmy. It took place at their reservation near Buffalo. Coming to the\r\nknowledge of the whites in the vicinity, it excited feelings of horror,\r\nmingled with indignation. The case was taken in hand by their authorities,\r\nwho without regard to Indian jurisdiction, arrested Tom-Jemmy and threw\r\nhim into prison.\r\n\r\nAt his trial the plea was set up in his defense, that the Indians were a\r\nsovereign and independent nation, having their own laws, and their own\r\nmode of carrying them into execution; that the offense was within the\r\nacknowledged bounds of their own territory, that according to their laws,\r\nit was not a crime, inasmuch as the act of the prisoner was in the\r\nexecution of a sentence, that had been passed upon the woman in question.\r\n\r\nThe trial was conducted with reference to this issue, and numerous\r\nwitnesses were examined to substantiate the facts having a bearing on the\r\ncase. Red Jacket, among others, was called upon the stand, and examined\r\nwith reference to the laws, and usages of his people.\r\n\r\nThe counsel who conducted the prosecution, wishing to exclude his\r\ntestimony, inquired whether he believed in the existence of a God? \"_More\r\ntruly than one who could ask me such a question_;\" was his instant and\r\nindignant reply.\r\n\r\nOn cross examination the inquiry was made, as to the rank he held among\r\nhis own people? \"Look at the papers, which the white men keep the most\r\ncarefully,\" meaning the treaties ceding their lands, \"and they will tell\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThe orator's testimony, as did also that of other witnesses, who testified\r\nin the case, went to show that this woman, according to the judgment of\r\nthe Indians, was a witch. That she had been regularly tried, and condemned\r\nby their laws; and her death was in conformity with usages, that had been\r\nin existence among them, from time immemorial.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of this examination, Red Jacket perceived that the\r\nbelief of the Indians in witchcraft, was made a subject of ridicule among\r\nthe bystanders, as well as legal gentlemen present, and he took occasion\r\nwhen an opportunity offered, to break forth in the following language:\r\n\r\n\"What! Do you denounce us as fools and bigots, because we still believe\r\nthat which you yourselves believed two centuries ago? Your black coats\r\nthundered this doctrine from the pulpit, your judges pronounced it from\r\nthe bench, and sanctioned it with the formalities of law; and you would\r\nnow punish our unfortunate brother, for adhering to the faith of _his_\r\nfathers and of _yours_! Go to Salem! Look at the records of your own\r\ngovernment, and you will find that hundreds have been executed for the\r\nvery crime, which has called forth the sentence of condemnation against\r\nthis woman, and drawn down upon her the arms of vengeance. What have our\r\nbrothers done, more than the rulers of your own people have done? And what\r\ncrime has this man committed, by executing in a summary way, the laws of\r\nhis country, and the command of the Great Spirit?\" [Footnote: Col. Stone,\r\nand also Drake's Book of the Indians.]\r\n\r\nIt has been observed of Red Jacket's appearance on this occasion: \"there\r\nis not, perhaps in nature, a more expressive eye than that of Red Jacket;\r\nwhen fired by indignation or revenge, it is terrible; and when he chooses\r\nto display his unrivalled talent for irony, his keen sarcastic glance, is\r\nirresistible.\" [Footnote: Drake.]\r\n\r\nThis trial resulted in finding the allegations in the prisoner's plea to\r\nbe true; yet the judgment being suspended, it was referred finally to the\r\nSupreme Court. A thorough examination of the laws, treaties and history\r\nrelating to our correspondence with the Indian tribes, gave evidence of a\r\nsort of sovereignty among them, but as it was thought inexpedient to\r\nrender a decision, that would recognize their independent jurisdiction,\r\nthe prisoner was liberated, and the case dismissed.\r\n\r\nNot far from the time we are now considering, a remarkable conversation\r\ntook place between Red Jacket and a young candidate for the clerical\r\noffice, who afterward became an eminent divine. [Footnote: Rev. John\r\nBreckenridge, D. D.] It serves very much to illustrate the orator's\r\ncharacter and views, and as we have permission, we give it entire, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"The first-opportunity I ever enjoyed of seeing that deservedly celebrated\r\nIndian chief, Red Jacket, was in the year 1821, at the residence of\r\nGeneral Peter B. Porter, Black Rock, New York. Being on a visit to the\r\ngeneral and his family, it seemed a peculiarly fit occasion to become\r\nacquainted with the great Seneca orator, whose tribe resided within a few\r\nmiles of Black Rock. General Porter embraced in his command, the Indian\r\nwarriors who fought with us on that line, during the late war, with Great\r\nBritain. From this cause; from his high character; his intimate\r\nacquaintance with the chiefs; and his known attachment to these\r\ninteresting people, he had great influence over them; and his lamented\r\nlady, who it is not indelicate for me to say, was my sister, had by her\r\nkindness won the rugged hearts of all their leading men. So that their\r\nunited influence, and my near relationship to them, secured to me at once\r\naccess to the chiefs, and their entire confidence.\r\n\r\n\"I had not only a great desire to see Red Jacket, but also to use this\r\nimportant opportunity to correct some of his false impressions, in regard\r\nto Christianity, and the missionaries established in his tribe. To this\r\nend it was agreed to invite Red Jacket and the other chiefs of the\r\nSenecas, to visit Co-na-shus-ta, [Footnote: Name given by Red Jacket to\r\nGeneral Porter.] and meet his brother at his house. The invitation was\r\naccordingly given, and very promptly and respectfully accepted.\r\n\r\n\"On the appointed day they made their appearance in due form headed by Red\r\nJacket, to the number of perhaps eight or ten, besides himself. Red Jacket\r\nwas dressed with much taste, in the Indian costume throughout. He wore a\r\nblue dress, the upper garment cut after the fashion of a hunting shirt,\r\nwith blue leggings, very neat moccasins, a red jacket, and a girdle of red\r\nabout his waist. I have seldom seen a more dignified or noble looking body\r\nof men than the entire group. It seems, though no such impression was\r\ndesigned to be made by the terms of the invitation, that some indefinite\r\nexpectation had been excited in their minds, of meeting an official agent\r\non important business. And they have been so unworthily tampered with, and\r\nso badly treated by us, as a people, and many of their most important\r\ntreaties have been so much the result of private and corrupting appeals,\r\nthat they very naturally look for some evil design in every approach to\r\nthem, however open and simple it may be. So it was on this occasion. As\r\nsoon as the ceremonies of introduction had passed, with the civilities\r\ngrowing out of it, the old orator seated himself in the midst of the\r\ncircle of chiefs, and after a word with them, followed by a general\r\nassent, he proceeded in a very serious and commanding manner, always\r\nspeaking in his own nervous tongue, through an interpreter, to address me\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"'We have had a call from our good friends,' (pointing to the general and\r\nhis lady), 'to come down to Black Rock to meet their brother. We are glad\r\nto break bread and to drink the cup of friendship with them. They are\r\ngreat friends to our people, and we love them much. Co-na-shus-ta is a\r\ngreat man. His woman has none like her. We often come to their house. We\r\nthank them for telling us to come to-day. But as all the chiefs were asked\r\nwe expected some important talk. Now, here we are: what is your business?'\r\n\r\n\"This, as may be readily supposed, was an embarrassing position to a young\r\nman just out of college. I paused. Every countenance was fixed upon me,\r\nwhile Red Jacket in particular seemed to search me with his arrowy eye,\r\nand to feel that the private and informal nature of the meeting, and the\r\nextreme youth of the man, were hardly in keeping with the character and\r\nnumber of the guests invited; and his whole manner implied, that 'but for\r\nthe sake of the general and his good viands, I should have waited for you\r\nto come to us.' With these impressions of his feelings, I proceeded to say\r\nin reply:\r\n\r\n\"That I should have thought it very presumptuous in me to send for him\r\nalone, and still more for all the chiefs of his tribe, to come so far to\r\nsee me; and that my intention had been to visit him, and the other chiefs\r\nat his town; but the general and his lady, could not go with me to\r\nintroduce me. Nor were we at all certain that we should find him and the\r\nother chiefs at home; and at any rate the general's house was more\r\nconvenient. He intended, when he asked them, to keep them as long as they\r\ncould stay, and to invite them to break his bread, and drink his cup, and\r\nsmoke his pipe; that his woman, and he as well as I, desired to see them\r\nat their house; that as to myself, I was a young man, and had no business\r\nwith them, except that I had heard a great deal of Red Jacket, and wished\r\nto see him and hear him talk; and also that I had some things to say to\r\nhim, when we were better acquainted, which though not _business_, were\r\nimportant to his people; and I thought it would be interesting to him, as\r\nI knew he loved his people much; and finally that I would return his\r\nvisit, and show him that it was not out of disrespect, but out of regard\r\nfor him, and great desire to see him, that we had sent for him, this being\r\nthe way that white men honor one another.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Porter immediately confirmed what I had said, and gave special point\r\nto the hospitality of the house, and the great desire I had to see Red\r\nJacket. Her appeal, added to the reply, relaxed the rigor of his manner\r\nand that of the other chiefs, while it relieved our interview of all\r\npainful feelings.\r\n\r\n\"After this general letting down of the scene, Red Jacket turned to me\r\nfamiliarly and asked; 'What are you? You say you are not a government\r\nagent, are you a gambler? [Footnote: The name given by Red Jacket to a\r\nland speculator.] or a black coat? or what are you?' I answered: 'I am yet\r\ntoo young a man to engage in any profession: but I hope some of these days\r\nto be a black coat.' He lifted up his hands accompanied by his eyes, in a\r\nmost expressive way, and though not a word was uttered, every one fully\r\nunderstood that he very distinctly expressed the sentiment, what a fool!\r\n\r\n\"I had too often been called to bear from those reputed great and wise\r\namong _white_ men, the shame of the cross, to be surprised by his\r\nmanner; and I was too anxious to conciliate his good feelings to attempt\r\nany retort, so that I commanded my countenance, and seeming not to have\r\nobserved him, I proceeded to tell him something about our colleges, etc.,\r\netc. That gradually led his mind away from the ideas with which it was\r\nfilled and excited when he arrived.\r\n\r\n\"A good deal of general conversation ensued, addressed to one and another\r\nof the chiefs, and we were just arriving at the hour of dinner, when our\r\nconference was suddenly broken up by the arrival of a breathless\r\nmessenger, saying that an old chief, whose name I forget, had just died,\r\nand the other chiefs were immediately needed to attend his burial. One of\r\nthe chiefs shed tears at the news; all seemed serious; but the others\r\nsuppressed their feelings, and spent a few moments in very earnest\r\nconversation, the result of which Red Jacket announced to us. They had\r\ndetermined to return at once to their village; but consented to leave Red\r\nJacket and his interpreter. In vain were they urged to wait until after\r\ndinner, or to refresh themselves with something eaten by the way. With\r\nhurried farewell and quick steps they left the house, and by the nearest\r\nfootpath returned home.\r\n\r\n\"This occurrence relieved me of one difficulty. It enabled me to see Red\r\nJacket at leisure and alone. It seemed also to soften his feelings, and\r\nmake him more affable and kind.\r\n\r\n\"Soon after the departure of the chiefs, we were ushered to dinner. Red\r\nJacket behaved with great propriety, in all respects; his interpreter,\r\nMajor Berry, though half a white man and perhaps a chief, eat like a true\r\nsavage. After a few awkward attempts at the knife and fork, he found\r\nhimself falling behind, and repeating the old adage which is often quoted\r\nto cover the same style among our white urchins of picking a chicken-bone,\r\n'_that fingers were made before knives and forks_,' he proceeded with\r\nreal gusto, and much good humor, to make up his lost time upon all parts\r\nof the dinner. It being over, I invited Red Jacket into the general's\r\noffice, where we had, for four hours a most interesting conversation on a\r\nvariety of topics, but chiefly connected with Christianity; the government\r\nof the United States; the missionaries; and his loved lands.\r\n\r\n\"So great a length of time has passed since that interview, that there\r\nmust be supposed a failure in the attempt perfectly to report what was\r\nsaid. I am well assured I cannot do justice to his language, even as\r\ndiluted by the ignorant interpreter; and his manner cannot be described.\r\nBut it was so impressive a conversation, and I have so often been called\r\non to repeat it, that the substance of his remarks has been faithfully\r\nretained by my memory. It is only attempted here to recite a small part of\r\nwhat was then said, and that with particular reference to the illustration\r\nof his character, mind and opinions.\r\n\r\n\"It has already been mentioned and is largely known, that Red Jacket\r\ncherished the most violent antipathy toward the American missionaries, who\r\nhad been located among his people. This led to very strenuous resistance\r\nof their influence, and to hatred of their religion, but of the true\r\ncharacter of which, he was totally ignorant. His deep attachment to his\r\npeople, and his great principle that their national glory and even\r\nexistence, depended upon keeping themselves distinct from white men, lay\r\nat the foundation of his aversion to Christianity. Though a pagan, yet his\r\nopposition was political, and he cared very little for any religion except\r\nso far as it seemed to advance, or endanger the glory and safety of the\r\ntribe.\r\n\r\n\"He had unfortunately been led by designing and corrupt white men, who\r\nwere interested in the result, falsely to associate the labors of the\r\nmissionaries, with designs against his nation; and those who wished the\r\nSenecas removed from their lands that _they_ might profit by the\r\npurchase, and who saw in the success of the mission the chief danger to\r\n_their_ plans, artfully enlisted the pagan party, of which Red Jacket\r\nwas the leader, to oppose the missionaries, and thus effectually led to\r\nthe final frustration of Red Jacket's policy; in and by the defeat of the\r\nmissionary enterprise. But as this question is discussed in the sequel, I\r\nwill not anticipate. Thus much it was necessary to premise, in order to\r\nexplain the nature and ends of my interview with Red Jacket.\r\n\r\n\"My object was to explain the true state of the case to him, and after\r\nthis to recommend the doctrine of Christ to his understanding and heart.\r\nMy first step, therefore, was to ask him why he so strongly opposed the\r\nsettlement and labors of the missionaries? He replied, because they are\r\nthe enemies of the Indians, and under the cloak of doing them good are\r\ntrying to cheat them out of their lands. I asked him what proof he had of\r\nthis. He said he had been told so by some of his wise and good friends,\r\namong the white men, and he observed that the missionaries were constantly\r\nwanting more land, and that by little and little, for themselves, or those\r\nwho hired them to do it, they would take away all their lands, and drive\r\nthem off.\r\n\r\n\"I asked him if he knew there was a body of white men, who had already\r\nbought the exclusive right to buy their lands, from the government of New\r\nYork, and that therefore the missionaries could not hold the lands given\r\nor sold them by the Indians, a moment after the latter left their lands\r\nand went away. He seemed to be startled by the statement, but said\r\nnothing. I proceeded to tell him that the true effect of the missionary\r\ninfluence on the tribe was to secure to them the possession of their\r\nlands, by civilizing them, and making them quit the chase, for the\r\ncultivation of the soil, building good houses, educating their children,\r\nand making them permanent citizens and good men. This was what the\r\nspeculators did not wish. Therefore they hated the missionaries. He\r\nacknowledged that the Christian party among the Indians did as I said; but\r\nthat was not the way for an Indian to do. Hunting, war and manly pursuits,\r\nwere best fitted to them. But, said I, your reservation of land is too\r\nlittle for that purpose. It is surrounded by the white people, like a\r\nsmall island by the sea; the deer, the buffalo and bear, have all gone.\r\nThis won't do. If you intend to live so much longer, you will have to go\r\nto the great western wilderness, where there is plenty of game, and no\r\nwhite men to trouble you. But he said, we wish to keep our lands and to be\r\nburied by our fathers. I know it, and therefore I say that the\r\nmissionaries are your best friends; for if you follow the ways they teach,\r\nyou can still hold your lands, though you cannot have hunting grounds, and\r\ntherefore you must either do like white men, or remove from your lands,\r\nvery soon. Your plan of keeping the Indians distinct from the white people\r\nis begun too late. If you would do it and have large grounds, and would\r\nlet the missionaries teach you Christianity, far from the bad habits and\r\nbig farms of the white people, it would then be well: it would keep your\r\npeople from being corrupted, and swallowed up by our people who grow so\r\nfast around you, and many of whom are very bad. But it is too late to do\r\nit here, and you must choose between keeping the missionaries, and being\r\nlike white men, and going to a far country: as it is, I continued, Red\r\nJacket is doing more than any body else to break up and drive away his\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\"This conversation had much effect upon him. He grasped my hand and said\r\nif that were the case it was new to him. He also said he would lay it up\r\nin his mind (putting his hand to his noble forehead), and talk of it to\r\nthe chiefs, and the people.\r\n\r\n\"It is a very striking fact that the disgraceful scenes now passing before\r\nthe public eye over the grave of Red Jacket, so early and so sadly fulfil\r\nthese predictions; and I cannot here forbear to add that the thanks of the\r\nnation are due to our present chief-magistrate, [Footnote: The President\r\nalluded to is Mr. Van Buren.--W. L. S.] for the firmness with which he has\r\nresisted the recent efforts to force a fraudulent treaty on the remnant of\r\nthis injured people, and drive them against their will, and against law\r\nand treaties sacredly made, away from their lands, to satisfy the rapacity\r\nof unprincipled men.\r\n\r\n\"It may be proper here to say likewise, that I do by no means intend to\r\njustify, all that possibly may have been done by the missionaries to the\r\nSenecas. It is probable the earliest efforts were badly conducted; and men\r\nof more ability ought to have been sent to that peculiar and difficult\r\nstation. But it is not for a moment to be admitted, nor is it credible\r\nthat the authors of the charge believe it, that the worthy men who at\r\nevery sacrifice went to the mission among the Senecas, had any other than\r\nthe purest purposes. I visited the station, and intimately knew the chief\r\nmissionary. I marked carefully their plan and progress, and do not doubt\r\ntheir usefulness any more than their uprightness; and beyond all doubt it\r\nwas owing chiefly to malignant influence exerted by white men, that they\r\nfinally failed in their benevolent designs. But my business is to narrate,\r\nnot to discuss.\r\n\r\n\"My next object was to talk with Red Jacket about Christianity itself. He\r\nwas prompt in his replies, and exercised and encouraged frankness, with a\r\nspirit becoming a great man.\r\n\r\n\"He admitted both its truth and excellence, as adapted to white men. He\r\nsaid some keenly sarcastic things about the treatment that so good a man\r\nas Jesus, had received from white men. The white men, he said, ought all\r\nto be sent to hell for killing him; but as the Indians had no hand in that\r\ntransaction, they were in that matter innocent. Jesus Christ was not sent\r\nto them; the atonement was not made for them; nor the Bible given to them;\r\nand therefore the Christian religion, was not meant for them. If the Great\r\nSpirit had intended that the Indians should be Christians, he would have\r\nmade his revelation to them, as well as to the white men. Not having done\r\nso, it was clearly his will that they should continue in the faith of\r\ntheir fathers. He said that the red man was of a totally different race,\r\nand needed an entirely different religion, and that it was idle as well as\r\nunkind, to try to alter their religion, and give them ours.\r\n\r\n\"I asked him to point out the difference of the races, contending that\r\nthey were one, and needed but one religion, and that Christianity was that\r\nreligion, which Christ intended for, and ordered to be preached, to all\r\nmen. He had no distinct views of the nature of Christianity as a method of\r\nsalvation, and denied the need of it. As to the unity of the races, I\r\nasked if he ever knew two distinct races, even of the lower animals to\r\npropagate their seed from generation to generation. But do not Indians and\r\nwhite men do so? He allowed it; but denied that it proved the matter in\r\nhand. I pressed the points of resemblance in every thing but color, and\r\nthat in the case of the Christian Indians there was a common mind on\r\nreligion. He finally waived this part of the debate, by saying that one\r\nthing was certain, whatever else was not, that white men had a great love\r\nfor Indian women, and left their traces behind them wherever they could!\r\n\r\n\"On the point of needing pardon, from being wicked, he said the Indians\r\nwere _good_ till the white man corrupted them. But did not the Indians\r\nhave _some_ wickedness _before_ that? 'Not so much.' And how was\r\n_that_ regarded by the Great Spirit?--Would he forgive it? He hoped\r\nso, 'did not know.' Jesus, I rejoined, came to tell us He would, and to\r\nget that pardon for us.\r\n\r\n\"As to suffering and death among the Indians, did not they prove that the\r\nGreat Spirit was angry with _them_, as well as with white men? Would\r\nhe thus treat men that were _good_? He said they were not wicked\r\nbefore white men came to their country, and taught them to be so. But they\r\n_died before that_? And why did they die, if the Great Spirit was not\r\nangry, and they wicked? He could not say, and in reply to my explanation\r\nof the gospel doctrine of the entrance of death by sin, he again turned\r\nthe subject by saying he was a 'great doctor,' and could cure any thing\r\nbut death.\r\n\r\n\"The interpreter had incidentally mentioned that the reason the chiefs had\r\nto go home so soon, was that they always _sacrificed a white dog on the\r\ndeath of a great man_. I turned this fact to the account of the\r\nargument, and endeavored to connect it with, and explain by it the\r\ndoctrine of atonement, by the blood of Christ, and also pressed him on the\r\nquestions, how can this _please_ the Great Spirit on _your_ plan?\r\nWhy do you offer such a _sacrifice_, for so it is considered? And\r\n_where_ they got such a rite from? He attempted no definite reply.\r\nMany other topics were talked over. But these specimens suffice to\r\nillustrate his views, and mode of thinking.\r\n\r\n\"At the close of the conversation he proposed giving me a _name_, that\r\nhenceforth I might be numbered among his friends, and admitted to the\r\nintercourse and regards of the nation. Supposing this not amiss, I\r\nconsented. But before he proceeded he called for some whiskey. He was at\r\nthis time an intemperate man, and though perfectly sober on that occasion,\r\nevidently displayed toward the close of the interview, the need of\r\nstimulus, which it is hardly necessary to say, we carefully kept from him.\r\nBut he _insisted_ now, and after some time a small portion was sent to\r\nhim in the bottom of a decanter. He looked at it, shook it, and with a\r\nsneer said, 'why here is not whiskey enough for a name to float in.' But\r\nno movement being made to get more, he drank it off, and proceeded with a\r\nsort of pagan orgies, to give me a name. It seemed a semi-civil, semi-\r\nreligious ceremony. He walked around me again and again, muttering sounds\r\nwhich the interpreter did not venture to explain; and laying his hand on\r\nme pronounced me 'Con-go-gu-wah,' and instantly, with great apparent\r\ndelight, took me by the hand as a brother. I felt badly during the scene,\r\nbut it was beyond recall, and supposing it might be useful in a future\r\nday, submitted to the initiation.\r\n\r\n\"Red Jacket was in appearance nearly sixty years old at this time. He had\r\na weather-beaten look; age had done something to produce this, probably\r\nintemperance more. But still his general appearance was striking, and his\r\nface noble. His lofty and capacious forehead, his piercing black eye, his\r\ngently curved lips, and slightly aquiline nose, all marked a great man,\r\nand as sustained and expressed by his dignified air, made a deep\r\nimpression on every one that saw him. All these features became doubly\r\nexpressive when his mind and body were set in motion by the effort of\r\nspeaking, if effort that may be called which flowed like a free, full\r\nstream from his lips. I saw him in the wane of life, and I heard him only\r\nin private, and through a stupid, careless interpreter. Yet\r\nnotwithstanding these disadvantages, he was one of the greatest men and\r\nmost eloquent orators I ever knew. His cadence was measured and yet very\r\nmusical. In ordinary utterance it amounted to a sort of musical monotony.\r\nBut when excited he would spring to his feet, elevate his head, expand his\r\narms and utter with indescribable effect of manner and tone, some of his\r\nnoblest thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"After this interesting conference had closed, the old chief with his\r\ninterpreter, bade us a very civil and kind farewell, and set forth on foot\r\nfor his own wigwam.\r\n\r\n\"It was four years after this before I had the pleasure of again seeing my\r\nold friend. I was then on a flying visit to Black Rock. At an early day I\r\nrepaired to his village, but he was not at home. Ten days after, as we\r\nwere just leaving the shore in the steamboat to go up the lake, he\r\nsuddenly presented himself. It was unhappily too late to return. He hailed\r\nme by name, and pointed with much animation to such parts of his person as\r\nwere decorated with some red cloth which I at parting had presented to\r\nhim, and which, though not worn as a jacket, was with much taste\r\ndistributed over his person. These he exhibited as proofs of his friendly\r\nrecollection.\r\n\r\n\"The last time I ever saw him was at the close of Mr. Adams'\r\nadministration. He, with a new interpreter (Major Berry having been\r\nremoved by death), had been on a visit to his old friend, Co-na-shus-tah,\r\nthen Secretary of War. After spending some time at the capital, where I\r\noften met him, and had the horror to see his dignity often laid in the\r\ndust, by excessive drunkenness, he paid me by invitation a final visit at\r\nBaltimore, on his way home. He took only time enough to dine. He looked\r\ndejected and forlorn. He and his interpreter had each a suit of common\r\ninfantry uniform, and a sword as common, which he said had been presented\r\nto him at the war department. He was evidently ashamed of them. I confess\r\nI was too. But I forbear. He was then sober and serious. He drank hard\r\ncider, which was the strongest drink I could conscientiously offer him, so\r\nI told him. He said it was enough. I said but little to him of religion,\r\nurged him to prepare to meet the Great Spirit, and recommended him to go\r\nto Jesus for all he needed. He took it kindly, said he should see me no\r\nmore, and was going to his people to die. So it was, not long after this,\r\nhe was called to his last account.\"\r\n\r\nCol. Stone represents the testimony of Dr. Breckenridge as corresponding\r\nwith hundreds of others, who confess their inability to do the orator\r\njustice. He laments \"his inability to make even an approach to justice, as\r\nto the language, and figures in which Red Jacket clothed his thoughts, and\r\nby which he illustrated and enforced them.\"\r\n\r\nAt another time the benefits of Christianity and the advantages of\r\ncivilization, being urged by a benevolent gentleman on Red Jacket's\r\nattention, he made use of the following language: \"As to civilization\r\namong the white people, I believe it is a good thing, and that it was so\r\nordered they should get their living in that manner. I believe in a God,\r\nand that it was ordered by Him that we, the red people, should get our\r\nliving in a different way, namely: from the wild game of the woods, and\r\nthe fishes of the waters. I believe in the Great Spirit who created the\r\nheavens and the earth. He peopled the forests, and the air and the waters.\r\nHe then created man and placed him as the superior animal of this\r\ncreation, and designed him as governor over all other created beings on\r\nearth. He created man differing from all other animals. He created the red\r\nman, the white, the black and the yellow. All these he created for wise\r\nbut inscrutable purposes.\"\r\n\r\nReasoning from analogy and from the different varieties of the same\r\nspecies, and the different species under one genus, among all other\r\nanimals, he pointed out their different modes of living, and the different\r\ndesigns of the Creator, that appeared to be evinced with respect to them.\r\nHe then proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"This being so, what proof have we that he did not make a similar\r\narrangement with the human species, when we find so vast, so various, and\r\nso irreconcilable a variety among them, causing them to live differently,\r\nand to pursue different occupations.\r\n\r\n\"As to religion, we all ought to have it. We should adore and worship our\r\nCreator, for his great favor in placing us over all his works. If we\r\ncannot with the same fluency of speech, and in the same flowing language,\r\nworship as you do, we have our mode of adoring, which we do with a sincere\r\nheart; then can you say that our prayers and thanksgivings, proceeding\r\nfrom grateful hearts, and sincere minds are less acceptable to the Great\r\nGod of the heavens and the earth, though manifested either by speaking,\r\ndancing, or feasting, than yours, uttered in your own manner and style?\"\r\n[Footnote: As quoted by Col. Stone from MS collections of Joseph W.\r\nMoulton.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nPersonal characteristics--Interview with General Lafayette--Visit of a\r\nFrench Nobleman--Col. Pickering reproved--Address on launching a schooner\r\nbearing his name--Anecdote of Red Jacket and Capt.

He probably did not\r\nunderrate his own ability. He felt conscious of possessing talents, which\r\nwould enable him to act with dignity and propriety, in any emergency\r\ncalling for their exercise. He never appeared to be intimidated or\r\nembarrassed at the thought of meeting with great men, but seemed always to\r\nbe at home in their society, and to feel and act as though he regarded\r\nhimself on an equality with them. This was evident in his interview with\r\nGeneral Lafayette, in 1825.\r\n\r\nOn being presented to the general, the orator inquired if he recollected\r\nbeing present, at the treaty of peace with the Six Nations at Fort\r\nStanwix, in 1784. Lafayette replied that he remembered that great council\r\nvery well. \"And what,\" said he, \"has become of the young chief, who\r\nresisted so strenuously and eloquently on that occasion, the idea of the\r\nIndians' burying the hatchet?\"\r\n\r\n\"_He is before you_,\" was the instant reply. Upon which the general\r\nremarked, that time had wrought very great changes upon them both since\r\nthat memorable period. \"Ah!\" said Red Jacket, \"time has not been so severe\r\non you, as it has on me. It has left you a fresh countenance, and hair to\r\ncover your head; while to me,--behold!\"--And taking a handkerchief from\r\nhis head, with an air of much feeling, he disclosed the fact that he was\r\nnearly bald. Several persons present could not refrain from smiling at the\r\nsimplicity of the Indian, who appeared ignorant of the way the white man,\r\nwas wont to repair the ravages of age in this respect. His simplicity was\r\nenlightened by the fact, that the general was indebted to a wig, for his\r\ngenerous supply of hair. Whereupon the orator playfully remarked,\r\nreferring to the practice of his people in war, that it had not occurred\r\nto him before, that he might supply the deficiency by _scalping_ some of\r\nhis neighbors. M. Lavasseur, the secretary of General Lafayette, remarks\r\nof the orator's appearance at that time. \"This extraordinary man, although\r\nmuch worn down by time and intemperance, preserves yet in a surprising\r\ndegree, the exercise of all his faculties. He obstinately refuses to speak\r\nany language, but that of his own people, and affects a great dislike to\r\nall others. Although it is easy to discern, that he perfectly understands\r\nthe English. He refused nevertheless, to reply to the general before his\r\ninterpreter had translated his questions into the Seneca language.\"\r\n[Footnote: See Drake, Col. Stone and others.]\r\n\r\nA few Indian words, which the general had picked up during his previous\r\nvisit to this country, on being repeated by him to the orator, gratified\r\nhim exceedingly, and appeared to increase very much his regard for\r\nLafayette.\r\n\r\nRed Jacket appeared always to be gratified by attentions received from\r\ndistinguished characters. Yet even to enjoy their society, he would not\r\ncompromise his own dignity. It is said that \"about the year 1820, a young\r\nFrench nobleman, who was making the tour of the United States, visited the\r\ntown of Buffalo. Hearing of the fame of Red Jacket, and learning that his\r\nresidence was but seven miles distant, he sent him word, that he was\r\ndesirous to see him, adding a request that the chief would visit him in\r\nBuffalo the next day. Red Jacket received the message with contempt, and\r\nreplied: 'Tell the _young man_ that if he wishes to see the _old\r\nchief_, he may find him with his nation, where other strangers pay their\r\nrespects to him; and Red Jacket will be glad to see him.'\r\n\r\n\"The count sent back his mesenger to say he was fatigued with his journey,\r\nand could not go to the Seneca village; that he had come all the way from\r\nFrance, to see the great orator of the Senecas, and after having put\r\nhimself to so much trouble, to see so distinguished a man, the latter\r\ncould not refuse to meet him at Buffalo.\r\n\r\n\"'Tell him,' said the sarcastic chief, 'It is very strange he should come\r\nso far to see me, and then stop within seven miles of my lodge.' The\r\nretort was richly merited. The count visited him at his wigwam, and then\r\nRed Jacket accepted an invitation to dine with him, at his lodgings at\r\nBuffalo.\r\n\r\n\"The young nobleman was greatly pleased with him, declaring that he\r\nconsidered him a greater wonder than the falls of Niagara. This remark was\r\nthe more striking as it was made within view of the great cataract. But it\r\nwas just. He who made the world, and filled it with wonders, has declared\r\nman to be the crowning work of the whole Creation.\" [Footnote: McKenney's\r\nIndian Biography.]\r\n\r\nOn one occasion at a treaty attended by Colonel Pickering, Red Jacket\r\nobserved that the attention of the colonel, who was in the habit of taking\r\ndown, as they were interpreted, the Indian speeches made, was withdrawn\r\nfrom himself, and his eye directed to the paper on which he was writing.\r\nRed Jacket paused. The colonel desired him to proceed. \"No,\" said the\r\norator, \"not when you hold down your head.\" \"Why can you not go on while I\r\nwrite?\" \"Because,\" replied the chief, \"if you look me in the eye, you will\r\nthen perceive if I tell you the truth or not.\" [Footnote: Col. Stone.]\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, Colonel Pickering turned, while the orator was\r\naddressing him to speak to a person near. The chief thereupon rebuked him,\r\nsaying with much emphasis, \"When a Seneca speaks he ought to be listened\r\nto with attention, from one extremity of this great island to the other.\"\r\n[Footnote: Ib.]\r\n\r\nToward the close of his life he was present by invitation, at the\r\nlaunching of a schooner at Black Rock, bearing his name. He made a short\r\naddress on the occasion which indicates the estimation in which he\r\nregarded his own merit. In the course of his speech, addressing himself\r\ndirectly to the vessel, he said: \"You have a great name given you, strive\r\nto deserve it. Be brave and daring. Go boldly into the great lakes, and\r\nfear neither the swift winds, nor the strong waves. Be not frightened nor\r\novercome by them, for it is by resisting storms and tempests, that I,\r\nwhose name you bear, obtained my renown. Let my great example inspire you\r\nto courage, and lead you to glory.\" [Footnote: Col. Stone.]\r\n\r\nAlso late in life, when at one of the hotels in Auburn, N. Y., observing a\r\nperson whom he thought did not treat him with proper deference, he came\r\nand stood before him and stamping his foot on the floor, exclaimed with\r\nmuch emphasis, \"_I am Red Jacket!_\" [Footnote: Incident given to the\r\nauthor by J. C. Ivison, Esq., of Auburn.]\r\n\r\nHe did not relish being trifled with even in playfulness.\r\n\r\n\"At one time when visiting the house of Captain Jones, on taking his seat\r\nat the breakfast table with the family, Mrs. Jones, knowing his extreme\r\nfondness for sugar, mischieviously prepared his coffee without the\r\naddition of that luxury. On discovering the cheat, the chief looked at the\r\ncaptain with an offended expression, and thus rebuked him: 'My son,'\r\nstirring his cup with energy, 'Do you allow your squaw thus to trifle with\r\nyour father?' Perceiving at the same time, by the giggling of the\r\nchildren, that they had entered into the joke, he continued, 'And do you\r\nallow your children to make sport of their chief?' Jones and his wife\r\nthereupon apologized, and the latter made the _amende honorable_, by\r\nhanding him the sugar-bowl, which he took, and with half angry sarcasm\r\nfilled the cup to the brim, with sugar. The liquid not holding so large a\r\nquantity in solution, he ate the whole with his spoon.\" [Footnote: Col.\r\nStone.]\r\n\r\nStill he enjoyed a laugh when he was making the sport. He was very\r\nentertaining in conversation, and would sometimes in the presence of his\r\nassociates, relax his dignity, and for a time, when he felt in the mood,\r\nkeep them in a roar of laughter, by his anecdotes, or by taking off\r\nsomething ludicrous, he had observed among the whites. When he had carried\r\nit sufficiently far, he would draw himself up, and resume his dignity,\r\nwhen by common consent, the sport would cease. [Footnote: Wm. Jones, to\r\nthe author.]\r\n\r\nHe very often entertained his people also, by recounting his interviews\r\nwith distinguished persons, or by describing what he had seen in great\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nOne conversant with him thus speaks of the manner in which he represented\r\nto his people, what he had seen during his visit at the seat of\r\ngovernment. \"I remember having seen him on one of those occasions, when,\r\nafter having seated the Indians around him in a semi-circle, taking the\r\ncocked hat that had been presented to him by General Knox, then Secretary\r\nof War, in his hand, he went round bowing to the Indians, as though they\r\nwere the company at the president's house, and himself the president. He\r\nwould then repeat to one and another all the compliments which he chose to\r\nsuppose the president had bestowed upon him, and which his auditors and\r\nadmiring people, supposed had been thus bestowed.\" [Footnote: Thomas\r\nMorris to Col. Stone.]\r\n\r\nRed Jacket had a very _tenacious memory_. The Indians were noted for\r\nthe care they bestowed on this faculty of the mind. In the absence of\r\nwritten records, they formed a device, which was quite ingenious, and\r\nindicated a high degree of intelligence, by which they perpetuated the\r\nknowledge of important events, in their history. They used belts, and\r\nstrings of wampum.\r\n\r\nFor instance, they are assembled to form some important treaty. This\r\n_treaty_ would be represented by the _belt_. Each string in that\r\nbelt would represent a distinct article, or provision in that treaty. As\r\nthey fixed their eye upon the belt, they knew it as well as though it had\r\nbeen labelled. As they took hold of each string, they could as it were,\r\nread each article of the treaty. For the preservation of these belts they\r\nhad what were termed their council-houses, where they were hung up in\r\norder, and preserved with great care. At times they were reviewed. The\r\nfather would go over them, and tell the meaning of each belt and of each\r\nstring in the belt to the son, and thus the knowledge of all their\r\nimportant events, was transmitted from one generation to another.\r\n\r\nRed Jacket, without any doubt excelled all of his race, in the perfection\r\nto which he had brought this faculty of his mind. Nothing escaped the\r\ntenacious grasp of his memory.\r\n\r\nThe following is an instance in point. At a council held with the Indians\r\nby Gov. Tompkins of New York, a contest arose between him and Red Jacket\r\nin regard to a fact connected with a treaty of many years' standing. Mr.\r\nTompkins stated one thing, and the Indian chief corrected him, insisting\r\nthat the reverse of his assertion was true. \"But\" it was rejoined: \"you\r\nhave forgotten.\" We have it written down on paper. \"The paper then tells a\r\nlie,\" was the confident answer; \"I have it written down here;\" he added,\r\nplacing his hand with great dignity on his brow. \"You Yankees are born\r\nwith a feather between your fingers, but your paper does not speak the\r\ntruth. The Indian keeps his knowledge here. This is the book the Great\r\nSpirit gave them; it does not lie.\" A reference was immediately made to\r\nthe treaty in question, when to the astonishment of all present, and the\r\ntriumph of the unlettered statesman, the document confirmed every word he\r\nhad uttered. [Footnote: McKenney's Indian Biography.]\r\n\r\nHe held in utter contempt _pretensions_ without _merit_. \"On one\r\noccasion not many years before his death, a gentleman from Albany, on a\r\nvisit at Buffalo, being desirous of seeing the chief, sent a message to\r\nthat effect. The gentleman was affluent in money and in words, the latter\r\nflowing forth with great rapidity, and in an inverse ratio to his ideas.\r\nHe had also a habit of approaching very near to any person with whom he\r\nwas conversing, and chattering with almost unapproachable volubility. On\r\nreceiving the message, Red Jacket dressed himself with the utmost care,\r\ndesigning, as he ever did when sober, to make the most imposing\r\nimpression, and came over to the village.\r\n\r\n\"Being introduced to the stranger, he soon measured his intellectual\r\ncapacity, and made no effort to suppress his disappointment, which was\r\nindeed sufficiently disclosed in his features. After listening, for a few\r\nmoments to the chatter of the gentleman, Red Jacket with a look of mingled\r\nchagrin and contempt, approached close to him and exclaimed, 'cha, cha,\r\ncha,' as rapidly as utterance would allow. Then drawing himself to his\r\nfull height, he turned proudly upon his heel, and walked away in the\r\ndirection of his own domicil, _as straight as an Indian_, nor deigned to\r\nlook behind while in sight of the tavern. The gentleman with more money\r\nthan brains, was for once lost in astonishment, and longer motionless and\r\nsilent than he had ever been before.\" [Footnote: Col. Stone.]\r\n\r\nHe held the mere sensualist in equal contempt. \"Many years ago, before the\r\nIndian towns were broken up along the valley of the Genesee, a clan of the\r\nSenecas resided at Canawangus, in the vicinity of the present town of\r\nAvon. The chief of the clan was a good, easy man, named Hot Bread. He was\r\na hereditary sachem, not having risen by merit, was weak and inefficient,\r\nand of gluttonous habits. On a certain occasion, when Mr. George Hosmer\r\nwas accompanying Red Jacket to an Indian council, in the course of general\r\nconversation he inquired the chief's opinion of Hot Bread. 'Waugh!'\r\nexclaimed Red Jacket: 'He has a little place at Canawangus, big enough for\r\nhim. _Big man here_,' laying his left hand on his abdomen, '_But very\r\nsmall here_,' bringing the palm of his right hand _with significant_\r\nemphasis to his forehead.\" [Footnote: Ib.]\r\n\r\nHe loved to hold communion with the sublime and grand in nature. He never\r\nwearied when viewing the falls of Niagara, and their roar, the baritone of\r\nnature's anthem, stirred within, depths that other harmonies failed to\r\nreach. When Mr. Catlin, the celebrated Indian portrait painter, desired to\r\nobtain the orator's picture, his consent was given, but he must be\r\nrepresented as standing on Table Rock, \"for,\" said he, \"when I pass to the\r\nother world, my spirit will come back, and that is the place around which\r\nit will linger.\" [Footnote: Catim's North American Indians.]\r\n\r\nThe artist gratified the orator, and represents him as standing there in\r\nthe attitude of deep thought, dressed with much care in complete Indian\r\ncostume, a very interesting memorial, presenting evident marks of being\r\none of nature's noblemen.\r\n\r\nSince then Red Jacket has gone to his grave, and this rock where he often\r\nstood and feasted his soul on sublimities unrivalled in nature, has\r\nlikewise fallen, while the world, like the impetuous flood, rolls on\r\nunconscious of both.\r\n\r\nOf the various paintings of Red Jacket, Col. Stone remarks, \"The picture\r\nby Mr. Robert W. Weir, taken in 1828, at the request of Doctor John W.\r\nFrancis of New York, is of far the highest order of merit, and has become\r\nthe standard likeness of the last of the Seneca orators.\" To this is\r\nsubjoined the following description from the pen of Doctor Francis, of the\r\norator's appearance on the occasion,\r\n\r\n\"For this purpose he dressed himself in the costume which he deemed most\r\nappropriate to his character, decorated with his brilliant overcovering\r\nand belt, his tomahawk, and Washington medal.\r\n\r\n\"For the whole period of nearly two hours, on four or five successive\r\ndays, he was as punctual to the arrangements of the artist, as any\r\nindividual could be. He chose a large arm chair for his convenience, while\r\nhis interpreter, as well as himself, was occupied for the most part in\r\nsurveying the various objects, which decorated the artist's room. He had a\r\nparty of several Senecas with him, who, adopting the horizontal position,\r\nin different parts of the room, regaled themselves with the fumes of\r\ntobacco, to their utmost gratification. Red Jacket occasionally united in\r\nthis relaxation; but was so deeply absorbed in attention to the work of\r\nthe painter, as to think, perhaps, of no other subject. At times he\r\nmanifested extreme pleasure, as the outlines of the picture were filled\r\nup. The drawing of his costume, which he seemed to prize, as peculiarly\r\nappropriate, and the falls of Niagara, scenery at no great distance from\r\nhis residence at the reservation, forced him to an indistinct utterance of\r\nsatisfaction. When his medal appeared complete in the picture, he\r\naddressed his interpreter, accompanied by striking gestures; and when his\r\nnoble front was finished, he sprang upon his feet with great alacrity, and\r\nseizing the artist by the hand, exclaimed with great energy, 'Good! Good!'\r\nThe painting being finished, he parted with Mr. Weir with a satisfaction\r\napparently equal to that which he doubtless, on some occasions had felt,\r\non effecting an Indian treaty. Red Jacket must have been beyond his\r\nseventieth year when the painting was made. He exhibited in his\r\ncountenance, somewhat of the traces of time and trial, on his\r\nconstitution. Nevertheless he was of a tall, erect form, and walked with a\r\nfirm gait. His characteristics are preserved by the artist to admiration;\r\nand his majestic front exhibits an attitude surpassing every other, that I\r\nhave ever seen of the human skull. As a specimen for the craniologist, Red\r\nJacket need not yield his pretensions to those of the most astute\r\nphilosopher. He will long live by the painting of Weir, the poetry of\r\nHalleck, and the fame of his own deeds.\"\r\n\r\nRed Jacket had a quick and acute perception, he was very adroit. He at one\r\ntime exposed the false pretenses of Jemima Wilkinson by arranging it with\r\na few Indians to converse in her presence, in a manner that excited her\r\ncuriosity. The ruse was successful, she anxiously inquired what they were\r\ntalking about? Turning upon her a searching glance, he exclaimed, \"What!\r\nAre you Jesus Christ? and not know Indian?\"\r\n\r\nThough unacquainted with the usages of society, in the refined circles\r\nwhere he often appeared, he readily adapted himself to the new position,\r\nand conducted with propriety and ease, careful to conceal his ignorance at\r\nthe time. Mr. Thomas Morris in a letter to Colonel Stone, observes: \"He\r\nonce on his return from Philadelphia, told me that when there he perceived\r\nmany things, the meaning of which he did not understand, but he would not\r\nmake inquiry concerning them there, because they would be imputed to his\r\nignorance. He therefore determined on his return to ask me.\r\n\r\n\"He said when he dined at General Washington's, a man stood all the time\r\nbehind his chair, and would, every now and then run off with his plate,\r\nand knife and fork, which he would immediately replace by others. 'Now,'\r\nsaid Red Jacket, 'what was this for?' I replied that he must have observed\r\non the president's table a variety of dishes, that each dish was cooked in\r\na different manner, and that the plates and knives and forks of the\r\nguests, were changed as often as they were helped from a different dish.\r\n'Ah!' said he, 'is that it?' I replied in the affirmative. 'You must then\r\nsuppose,' he continued, 'that the plates, and knives, and forks, retain\r\nthe taste of the cookery?' Yes, I replied. 'Have you then,' he added, 'any\r\nmethod by which you can change your palates every time you change your\r\nplates? For I should suppose that the taste would remain on the palate\r\nlonger than on the plate?' I replied that we were in the habit of washing\r\nthat away by drinking wine. 'Ah!' said he, 'now I understand it. I was\r\npersuaded that so general a custom among you was founded in reason, and I\r\nonly regret that when I was in Philadelphia I did not understand it; when\r\ndining with General Washington and your father. The moment the man went\r\noff with my plate I would have drunk wine until he brought me another; for\r\nalthough I am fond of eating, I am more so of drinking.'\" [Footnote: Col.\r\nStone's Life of Red Jacket.]\r\n\r\nIt has been well observed of him, \"He had an innate refinement and grace\r\nof manner, that stamped him the true gentleman, because with him these\r\nvirtues were inborn, and not simulated or acquired.\" [Footnote: W. C.\r\nBryant's Memorial Address.]\r\n\r\nOn one occasion when Mr. George Hosmer of Avon, and several others of his\r\ntribe, were on their way to attend a certain treaty, the Indians one\r\nevening after the fatigues of the day, were unusually mirthful. Red Jacket\r\nconceiving the idea that Mr. Hosmer, who was unacquainted with their\r\nlanguage might suppose he was the subject of their mirth, caused them to\r\nbe silent, and through his interpreter, Captain Parrish, thus addressed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"We have been made uncomfortable by the storm; we are now warm and\r\ncomfortable, it has caused us to feel cheerful and merry. But I hope our\r\nfriend who is traveling with us will not feel hurt at this merriment, or\r\nsuppose that we are taking advantage of his ignorance of our language, to\r\nmake him in any manner the subject of our mirth.\"\r\n\r\nTo which Mr. Hosmer replied, that knowing himself to be in the company of\r\nbrave and honorable men, he could not allow himself to entertain such an\r\nimpression. After which they resumed their merriment, and Red Jacket his\r\ngravity. [Footnote: Col. Stone.]\r\n\r\nThe first efforts to construct a bridge at Niagara Falls was unsuccessful.\r\nIt was supposed the force of the water where it flowed smoothly, would not\r\nbe as great as where it dashed against the rocks and appeared more\r\nboisterous. This was a mistake. Every endeavor to fix a bent where the\r\nwater was smooth, proved utterly abortive. At length an architect\r\nconceived the idea of placing the bridge, down where the water began to be\r\nbroken in its descent, and of obtaining a foot-hold for his bent, behind\r\nsome rock against which the water dashed. This resulted in the successful\r\ncompletion of a bridge, leading to Goat Island. After its completion, Red\r\nJacket, in company with General Porter, was passing over it one day, when\r\nthe chief, whose curiosity was excited, examined minutely every part of\r\nits construction, evidently regarding it, as a great wonder. At length\r\ndiscovering the secret, he exclaimed, \"_Ugh! still water_!\" and\r\nimmediately added, \"_d--n Yankee_.\" [Footnote: Given to the author by T.\r\nM. Howell, Esq., of Canandaigua, N. Y.]\r\n\r\nRed Jacket was not a stranger to _tender and refined sensibilities_.\r\n\r\nWilliam Savary in his Journal, while attending the Indian treaty held at\r\nCanandaigua in 1794, speaks of the children of Red Jacket in terms of high\r\ncommendation. Most of them died of consumption, \"in the dew of their\r\nyouth.\"\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, when visiting an aged lady of his acquaintance near Avon,\r\nwho from early life had been more or less familiar with his history, she\r\ninquired of him, if any of his children were still living? Fixing his eyes\r\nupon her, with a sorrowful expression, he replied:\r\n\r\n\"Red Jacket was once a great man, and in favor with the Great Spirit. He\r\nwas a lofty pine among the smaller trees of the forest. But after years of\r\nglory he degraded himself, by drinking the firewater of the white man. The\r\nGreat Spirit has looked upon him in anger, and his lightning has stripped\r\nthe pine of its branches.\" [Footnote: Related to Col. Stone by Mrs. George\r\nHosmer of Avon.]\r\n\r\nSome four or five years before his death, three brothers, named Thayer,\r\nwere executed at Buffalo for the crime of murder. The occasion was\r\nunusual, and multitudes of both sexes, from the surrounding region,\r\nflocked to witness the unhappy spectacle.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the execution, Red Jacket was met by Judge Walden, of\r\nBuffalo, wending his way from the town to his home. The judge inquired\r\nwhere he was going? At the same time expressing his surprise that he did\r\nnot go with the multitudes, flocking to witness the spectacle. His answer\r\nwas brief; \"Fools enough there already. Battle, is the place to see men\r\ndie.\"\r\n\r\nThe reply was a merited rebuke to the desire so prevalent, to witness\r\nthese awful sights. [Footnote: Mrs. George Hosmer to Col. Stone.]\r\n\r\nRed Jacket ever cherished a watchful regard over the interests of his\r\npeople, and was always ready to speak in their behalf.\r\n\r\nAt the trial of an Indian for burglary, himself and other chiefs were\r\npresent to render any aid in their power, to their brother in bonds. The\r\nprisoner was found guilty of having broken into a house and stolen a few\r\nsilver spoons. The crime of petit larceny, was thus merged in the greater\r\none of burglary.\r\n\r\nAt a fitting opportunity Red Jacket arose and spoke eloquently in his\r\nbrother's defense; urging the independence of his nation, the existence\r\namong them of laws for the punishment of theft, and boldly demanding the\r\nsurrender of the prisoner, assuring the court that the prisoner should be\r\ntried by these laws, and suffer the penalty they demanded. His effort\r\nthough regarded as able and brilliant, did not avail to rescue the\r\nprisoner from the white man, whose sentence in the case being for burglary\r\ninstead of theft, Red Jacket regarded as unnecessarily severe.\r\n\r\nWhen the proceedings were over, Red Jacket, who happened to be standing\r\nwith a group of lawyers, took the following method of expressing his\r\ndissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nBeholding on the sign of a printing office near by, an emblematic\r\nrepresentation in large figures and characters, of Liberty and Justice; he\r\nasked in broken English, pointing to one of them, \"_What-him-call?_\"\r\nIt was answered, _Liberty_. \"Ugh!\" was his significant and truly\r\naboriginal response. Pointing then to the other figure, he inquired,\r\n\"_What_-HIM-call?\" It was answered, JUSTICE. Whereupon his eye\r\nkindling with animation, he asked with evident emotion, \"WHERE-HIM-LIVE-\r\nNOW?\" [Footnote: Geo. Hosmer, Esq., to Col. Stone.]\r\n\r\nIf the sincerity of Red Jacket's regard for the welfare of his people was\r\never questioned, it was by those who knew not his inner self. In guarding\r\nthe interests of his people, he was in the habit of closely watching\r\nstrangers, not only, but even his own friends.\r\n\r\nOwing to slanderous reports that had been circulated, he at one time began\r\nto suspect that his friend Captain Jones, was actuated by motives of self-\r\ninterest, and did not property regard the interest of the Indians.\r\n\r\nJones soon after met Red Jacket with his usual cordiality of manner, but\r\nwas received with evident marks of coldness and distrust. \"After the lapse\r\nof a few minutes, during which time the questions of Jones were answered\r\nin monosylables, the captain asked an explanation of the orator's conduct.\r\nFixing his searching glance upon him, as if reading the secrets of his\r\nsoul, Red Jacket told him of the rumor circulated, in reference to his\r\nfidelity to the Indians, and concluded by saying with a saddened\r\nexpression, 'And have _you_ at last deserted us?' The look, the tone, the\r\nattitude of the orator, were so touching, so despairing, that Jones,\r\nthough made of stern materials, wept like a child; at the same time\r\nrefuting the calumny in the most energetic terms. Convinced that Jones was\r\nstill true, the chief, forgetful of the stoicism of his race, mingled his\r\ntears with those of Jones, and embracing him with the cordiality of old,\r\nthe reconciled parties renewed old friendship over a social glass.\"\r\n[Footnote: W. H. C. Hosmer to Col. Stone.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nViews at the close of life--Incident--His life work--Unfavorable\r\ninfluences--Advance of the Christian party--Conversion of Red Jacket's\r\nwife--He leaves her--His return--Red Jacket deposed--Journey to Washington\r\n--His restoration--Rapid decline--Regards his end as near--Talks with his\r\npeople--Endeavors to unite them.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the views entertained by Red Jacket, the objects that met him on\r\nevery side, as he drew near the close of life, were far from pleasant.\r\nYonder hillside, exposed to the gaze of the world, its huge rocks laid\r\nbare; those fields, stretching further than eye could reach, bounded not\r\nby woodland, lake, or river, but by the white man's fence; ten thousand\r\ndwellings, smiling with the abundance and thrift of the husbandman, city\r\nand village, bustling with tumult, and the noise of busy hammers, and\r\nrattling wheels, and roaring engines; all of these however gratifying to\r\nthe white man, as marks of improvement, afforded him no pleasure. He saw\r\nin them the sepulcher of his people's pride and glory.\r\n\r\nThe hillside opened to the sunlight, for the innocent lamb to sport upon,\r\nor to make the stable ox a home, he would have loved better, as when\r\nsheltered once by the sturdy oak or stately pine, its rocks jutting out\r\nfrom behind the ivy, and its bosom threaded by the path of the deer. The\r\nfields might have appeared inviting and green, but the white man's barrier\r\nwould have warned him away, the road he would have looked upon as a\r\nprisoned path, and he would have taken to the woods, as a place more\r\ncongenial to his spirit.\r\n\r\nIt is said of him \"that in the days of his youth he was wont to join the\r\nhunters in the beautiful valley of the Genesee, with great enthusiasm.\r\nGame was then plenty, and they were the finest hunting grounds, he could\r\ntraverse. Toward the close of his life he went thither to indulge once\r\nmore, in the pleasures of the chase, where a forest apparently of\r\nconsiderable extent, yet remained. He entered it, recognizing some of his\r\nancient friends among the more venerable of the trees, and hoping yet to\r\nfind abundant game. But he had not proceeded far before he approached an\r\nopening; and his course was presently impeded by a fence, within the\r\nenclosure of which, one of the pale faces was guiding the plow. With a\r\nheavy heart he turned in another direction, the forest seeming yet to be\r\ndeep, and where he hoped to find a deer, as in the days when he was young.\r\nBut he had not traveled long, before another opening broke upon his view,\r\nanother fence impeded his course, and another cultivated field appeared\r\nwithin. He sat down and wept.\" [Footnote: Circumstances related to Col.\r\nStone by a Seneca chief.]\r\n\r\nIt has been well observed: \"The whole life of the Seneca chief was spent\r\nin vain endeavors to preserve the independence of his tribe, and in active\r\nopposition as well to the plans of civilization proposed by the\r\nbenevolent, as to the attempts at encroachment on the part of the\r\nmercenary.... He yielded nothing to persuasion, to bribery, or to menace,\r\nand never to his last hour remitted his exertions, in what he regarded the\r\nnoblest purpose of his life.\" [Footnote: McKenney's Biography.]\r\n\r\nBut at the close of life, Red Jacket began to realize more than ever the\r\npower of those forces bearing down upon him, to resist which he had\r\nsummoned all the energies he could command. His people, notwithstanding\r\nhis efforts, were constantly brought by the encroachments of the whites,\r\ninto a narrower compass, and the religion and customs of the whites\r\ncontinued to gain ground, and threatened to supercede the time honored\r\nusages of his fathers.\r\n\r\nIntoxicating drinks also, the bane of the Indian race, wrought sad havoc\r\namong his people, and had well nigh ruined himself. His influence was thus\r\neffectually crippled, and his opposition to Christianity, and the efforts\r\nof the whites to obtain their land, carried much less weight, than at an\r\nearlier period of his life. He saw and felt this, and in view of it, was\r\nmuch cast down.\r\n\r\nHis opposition to Christianity, is said to have been much encouraged by\r\nwicked and designing men among the whites, who feared that the presence of\r\nmissionaries among the Indians, would interfere with their unworthy and\r\nbase designs.\r\n\r\nBut his decision when formed, as already intimated, was consistently and\r\nperseveringly maintained. He narrowly watched every proceeding, gathered\r\naround him such as would be controlled by his influence, or example, and\r\ninculcated in them those sentiments of steadfastness, in the religion of\r\ntheir fathers, so strikingly manifested in his own conduct.\r\n\r\nAfter various discouragements and reverses, the missionary was at length\r\nestablished among his people, and the adherents of Red Jacket, which at\r\nfirst were the most numerous, by degrees diminished, until finally those\r\nfriendly to Christianity, outnumbered the others. Red Jacket's people one\r\nby one, became interested in the religion the missionary had come to\r\nteach. The schools established began to be well attended, several chiefs\r\nembraced the new religion; some of them were men of influence and carried\r\nwith them many others. Finally in 1826, Red Jacket's wife became\r\ninterested on the subject of religion, attended the meetings of the\r\nChristians, was led to abandon the pagan worship, she formerly attended,\r\naltogether, and giving evidences of piety, proposed to unite with the\r\nmission church, under the care of the Rev. Mr. Harris.\r\n\r\nBefore uniting, she laid the subject before Red Jacket and desired his\r\nconsent. This he utterly refused, and threatened in case she did so, to\r\nleave her and never visit her again. Her trial in view of this refusal,\r\nshe referred to Mr. Harris, who kindly endeavored to show her what the law\r\nof Christianity demanded, that it required her to obey God, rather than\r\nman; that though her course might subject her to trial, she had the\r\npromise of the grace of Christ to help her, and that in the end it might\r\npromote her good. Still he committed the matter wholly to her own\r\nconscience, advising her to pursue the course that might thus be\r\nindicated, and leave the event in the hands of God.\r\n\r\nAfter deliberating for a time she united with the church, and Red Jacket,\r\ntrue to his threat, left her and went to another reservation. She bore his\r\ndispleasure with a meek and Christian spirit, remained at home with her\r\nfamily, and conducted discreetly, pursuing as before the duties of her\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\nRed Jacket after a few months' absence returned, desiring to be welcomed\r\nagain by his wife, who received him on condition of his not interfering\r\nwith her, in her religious views, or attendance on the meetings of the\r\nmission. To this he gave his assent, and was ever afterward faithful in\r\nobserving his pledge; not opposing, but aiding her in performing,\r\naccording to her desire, her religious obligations.\r\n\r\nA division was now apparent among the Senecas, in regard to religion.\r\nThere was a Christian, and a Pagan party. The former led by Young King,\r\nCaptain Pollard, and others; the latter recognized Red Jacket as its\r\nruling spirit.\r\n\r\nThe opposition he had so long exerted, began to be regarded with\r\nimpatience. As the Christian party advanced and became more numerous, they\r\nwere unwilling to submit to the dictation of the orator. They began to\r\nfeel that in his opposition to the education and improvement of his\r\npeople, he was acting the part of an enemy, and not a friend.\r\n\r\nHis habits of intemperance also, having greatly lessened their esteem,\r\nthey became unwilling he should longer hold the commanding position he had\r\nenjoyed, and so well adorned, in the earlier part of his life. At a\r\ncouncil held in September, 1827, a paper was drawn up, containing charges\r\nagainst the orator, which were assigned as a reason for the extraordinary\r\ncourse they pursued, closing with the declaration, that they renounced him\r\nas their chief, and forbade him to act as one, affirming that he should\r\nthereafter be regarded as a private man.\r\n\r\nThis proceeding stung the orator to the quick, and aroused him to action,\r\nHe could not endure the thought of the humiliation thus brought upon him,\r\nat the close of life. The thought too, that it had been effected by those\r\nwho differed from him, in their religious sentiments, and would be\r\nregarded as a triumph over him, touching the views he had long\r\nentertained, as to what would best promote the welfare of his people,\r\naffected him in a point so near his heart, as to forbid his resting under\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"It shall not be said,\" thought he, \"that Sa-go-ye-wat-ha, lived in\r\ninsignificance, and died in disgrace. Am I not yet strong? Have I not yet\r\npower to withstand my enemies?\"\r\n\r\nHe set out for Washington, to spread his griefs before his great Father.\r\nOn arriving there he visited Colonel McKenney, who had charge of Indian\r\naffairs. That officer had been informed, through the Indian agent, of all\r\nthat had transpired among the Senecas, and of the cause of their\r\ndispleasing Red Jacket.\r\n\r\nWhen the customary salutations were over, Red Jacket remarked through his\r\ninterpreter, \"I have a talk for my Father.\" \"Tell him,\" said Colonel\r\nMcKenney, \"I have one for him. I will make it, and will then listen to\r\nhim.\" The colonel then proceeded to give a minute history of all that had\r\nrecently transpired, and dwelt upon the various causes that had operated\r\nin producing the rupture, that had taken place. He pointed out to him the\r\ncourse he ought to have pursued, that he should have manifested a spirit\r\nof forbearance, and allowed the Christian party the same liberty in the\r\nexercise of their sentiments, which he demanded for himself; and that this\r\ncourse would have saved him the mortification he now experienced, in being\r\nexpelled from office and power.\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation Red Jacket never took his keen and searching eye\r\nfrom the speaker, but at its close turned to the interpreter, and pointing\r\nin the direction of his home and people, said, \"_Our Father has got a\r\nlong eye._\"\r\n\r\nHe then proceeded to vindicate himself and his cause, not forgetting to\r\npour upon the Black coats plentiful effusions of wrath. The colonel\r\nadvised him to return to his people, convene a council and come to a\r\nbetter understanding with them, by allowing those among them who desired\r\nto do so, to become Christians, while himself and those who thought like\r\nhim, might claim the privilege of following unmolested, the faith of their\r\nfathers. [Footnote: Col. McKenney's Indian Biography.]\r\n\r\nAbout one month had passed since Red Jacket's deposition. In the mean time\r\nRed Jacket had been very active in going from one reservation to another,\r\nand sparing no pains, in gathering a Great Council, from those belonging\r\nto the Six Nations.\r\n\r\nAnother council was convened, much larger than the former, composed of\r\nmembers from other reservations, belonging to the Iroquois confederacy. It\r\nassembled at the upper council-house of the Seneca village near Buffalo.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the council, the paper declaring the orator's deposition\r\nwas read. Half Town, a Seneca chief of the Cattaraugus reservation then\r\narose, and said there was but one voice in his nation, and that was of\r\ngeneral indignation at the contumely cast on so great a man as Red Jacket.\r\nThe council was then addressed by several other chiefs very much to the\r\nsame effect. After which the condemned orator arose slowly, as if grieved\r\nand humiliated, but yet with his ancient air of command.\r\n\r\n\"My Brothers:\" said he, after a solemn pause, \"You have this day been\r\ncorrectly informed of an attempt to make me sit down, and throw off the\r\nauthority of a chief, by twenty-six misguided chiefs of my nation. You\r\nhave heard the statements of my associates in council, and their\r\nexplanations of the foolish charges brought against me. I have taken the\r\nlegal and proper way to meet these charges. It is the only way in which I\r\ncould notice them. Charges which I despise, and which nothing would induce\r\nme to notice, but the concern which many respected chiefs of my nation,\r\nfeel in the character of their aged comrade. Were it otherwise I should\r\nnot be before you. I would fold my arms, and sit quietly under these\r\nridiculous slanders.\r\n\r\n\"The Christian party have not even proceeded legally to put me down.\" He\r\nthen made some artful observations on the origin of the attack made upon\r\nhim. He laid open its history step by step. He dwelt upon the various\r\ncircumstances connected with the introduction of Christianity among them.\r\nHe alluded to the course taken by the Christians as ruinous and\r\ndisgraceful, especially in their abandonment of the religion of their\r\nfathers, and their sacrifices, and of the lands given them by the Great\r\nSpirit, for paltry considerations. As for the _Black coats_, Mr.\r\nCalhoun had told him at Washington four years before, that the Indians\r\nmust treat with them as they thought proper; the government would not\r\ninterfere. \"I will not consent,\" said he, sagaciously identifying his\r\ndisgrace with his opposition to the Christians, \"I will not consent\r\nsilently to be trampled under foot. As long as I can raise my voice, I\r\nwill oppose such measures. As long as I can stand in my moccasins, I will\r\ndo all I can for my nation. Ah! it grieves my heart, when I look around me\r\nand see the situation of my people, in old times united and powerful, now\r\ndivided and feeble. I feel sorry for my nation. Many years have I guided\r\nmy people. When I am gone to the other world, when the Great Spirit calls\r\nme away, who among them can take my place?\" [Footnote: Thatcher's Indian\r\nBiography.]\r\n\r\nNo adequate account of this speech has been preserved. It is said he spoke\r\nthree hours in his own defense; that it was a masterly effort, and equal\r\nto the speeches he used to make in his palmiest days. [Footnote:\r\nConversation of the author with Wm. Jones, Seneca chief.]\r\n\r\nThough greatly dilapidated in his powers by intemperance, he was\r\nthoroughly aroused on this occasion, and the eloquence, pathos, and fire\r\nof a former day, shed around him the luster of a superior mind, and his\r\npeople for the time, forgot and forgave his delinquencies, and by\r\nunanimous consent, reinstated him in office and power.\r\n\r\nThus by means of one more great exertion of this wonderful faculty, by\r\nwhich he controlled the minds of his people, they were led to reverse the\r\ndecision that had been made against him, and though he stood among them\r\nbut the blasted trunk of that tree, which, in its full and luxuriant\r\nprime, cast a deep and mellowing shade over their closing history, and\r\ninvested it still with the appearance of strength; they resolved he should\r\nyet wear the title, that better befitted him in other days, though it\r\nserved but slightly to hide the deformity, wrought in his noble nature, by\r\nthe demon of intemperance.\r\n\r\nWith this speech the public career of Red Jacket is closed. The effort he\r\nmade on this occasion, added to his exertions previous to the gathering of\r\nthe council, was too great for his aged and enfeebled condition. After\r\nthis he declined very rapidly, and seemed to realize that his end was\r\ndrawing near. He often adverted to this event, but always in language of\r\nphilosophic calmness.\r\n\r\nIn view of it he visited successively all of his most intimate friends, at\r\ntheir cabins, and talked with them in the most impressive and affecting\r\nmanner. He told them that he was passing away, and his counsels would soon\r\nbe heard no more. He ran over the history of his people, from the most\r\nremote period to which his knowledge extended, and pointed out as few\r\ncould, the wrongs, the privations, and the loss of character, which almost\r\nof themselves constituted that history. \"I am about to leave you,\" said\r\nhe, \"and when I am gone, and my warnings shall be no longer heard, or\r\nregarded, the craft and avarice of the white man will prevail. Many\r\nwinters have I breasted the storm, but I am an aged tree, I can stand no\r\nlonger. My leaves are fallen, my branches are withered, and I am shaken by\r\nevery breeze. Soon my aged trunk will be prostrate, and the foot of the\r\nexulting foe of the Indian, may be placed upon it in safety; for I leave\r\nnone who will be able to avenge such an indignity. Think not I mourn for\r\nmyself. I go to join the spirits of my fathers, where age cannot come; but\r\nmy heart fails, when I think of my people, who are soon to be scattered\r\nand forgotten.\"\r\n\r\nMany noticed that his feelings at this time were greatly modified and\r\nmellowed, with respect to the stand he had taken against Christianity. His\r\nwife's example, who was a woman of humble, consistent piety, exerted a\r\nsalutary, and happy influence upon him. It led him to regard Christianity\r\nmore favorably, and to recede very much from the hostile position he had\r\npreviously maintained. He talked of peace, and sought to bring about a\r\nreconciliation between the two parties. He convened a council with this in\r\nview. He made special preparations to attend it, dressing himself with\r\nmore than ordinary care, with all his gay apparel and ornaments. He went\r\nwith the intention of making what would have been his farewell speech, and\r\ngiving them his last counsel.\r\n\r\nHe was taken suddenly ill at the Council-house, of cholera morbus and\r\nreturned home, saying to his wife, \"I am sick; I could not stay at the\r\ncouncil, I shall never recover.\"\r\n\r\nHe then took off his rich costume, and laid it carefully away, reclined\r\nupon his couch, and did not rise again till morning. His wife prepared him\r\nmedicine, which he took, but said, \"it will do no good. I shall die.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day he called his wife and the little girl he loved so much,\r\nrequested them to sit beside him and listen to his parting words.\r\nAddressing his wife, he said: \"I am going to die, I shall never again\r\nleave this house alive. I wish to thank you for your kindness to me. You\r\nhave loved me. You have always prepared my food, and taken care of my\r\nclothes, and been patient with me. I am sorry I ever treated you unkindly.\r\nI am sorry I left you, because of your new religion. I am convinced it is\r\na good religion, and has made you a better woman, and wish you to\r\npersevere in it. I should like to live longer for your sake. I meant to\r\nbuild you a new house, and make you more comfortable, but it is now too\r\nlate.\"\r\n\r\nAddressing his daughter, he said; \"I hope my daughter will remember what I\r\nhave so often told her, not to go in the streets with strangers, or\r\nassociate with improper persons. She must stay with her mother, and grow\r\nup a respectable woman.\"\r\n\r\nHe said again: \"When I am dead, it will be noised abroad through all the\r\nworld, they will hear of it across the great waters, and say, Red Jacket\r\nthe great orator is dead. And white men will come and ask you for my body.\r\nThey will wish to bury me. But do not let them take me. Clothe me in my\r\nsimplest dress, put on my leggins and my moccasins, and hang the cross I\r\nhave worn so long, around my neck, and let it lie upon my bosom. Then bury\r\nme among my people. Neither do I wish to be buried with Pagan rites. I\r\nwish the ceremonies to be as you like, according to the customs of your\r\nnew religion, if you choose. Your minister says the dead will rise.\r\nPerhaps they will. If they do, I wish to rise with my old comrades. I do\r\nnot wish to rise among pale faces. I wish to be surrounded by red men. Do\r\nnot make a feast according to the customs of the Indians. Whenever my\r\nfriends chose, they could come and feast with me, when I was well, and I\r\ndo not wish those who have never eaten with me in my cabin, to surfeit at\r\nmy funeral feast.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished he laid down on his couch and did not rise again. He\r\nlived several days but was most of the time in a stupor, or else\r\ndelirious. He often asked for Mr. Harris, the missionary, and would\r\nafterward unconsciously mutter: \"I do not hate him. He thinks I hate him,\r\nbut I do not, I would not hurt him.\" The missionary was sent for\r\nrepeatedly, but was from home at the time, and did not return till after\r\nthe chief's death.\r\n\r\nWhen the messenger told him Mr. Harris had not come, he replied: \"Very\r\nwell, the Great Spirit will order it as he sees best, whether I shall\r\nspeak with him or not.\" [Footnote: Conversation of the author with Wm.\r\nJones, Seneca chief, and sketch of Red Jacket in \"The Iroquois.\" The\r\naccount of the orator's closing hours given in this work, is more full,\r\nbut in perfect accord with the statements made to the author by Mr.\r\nJones.] Again he would murmur: \"He accused me of being a snake, and trying\r\nto bite somebody. This was true, and I wish to make satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\nThe cross he wore was a very rich one of stones set in gold, and large; by\r\nwhom it was given, his friends never knew. This is all the ornament he\r\nrequested to have buried with him.\r\n\r\nIt was customary among the Indians to make funeral feasts. No family was\r\nso poor as not thus to honor the dead. If all they possessed was a cow, it\r\nwas slaughtered for the occasion. Red Jacket desired nothing of this kind.\r\nA pagan funeral for a distinguished person is a pompous affair, and lasts\r\nfor ten days. Every night a fire is kindled at the grave, and around it\r\nthe mourners gather, and utter piteous wails.\r\n\r\nThe wife and daughter were the only ones to whom he spoke parting words,\r\nor gave a parting blessing. As his last hour drew nigh, his family all\r\ngathered around him, but the children were not his own, they were step-\r\nchildren, his own were all sleeping in the churchyard, where he was soon\r\nto be laid.\r\n\r\nHis step-children he always loved and cherished, their mother had taught\r\nthem to love and honor him. The wife sat by his pillow and rested her hand\r\non his head. At his feet stood the two sons, now aged and Christian men,\r\nand by his side the little girl, whose hand rested on his withered and\r\ntrembling palm. His last words were still, \"Where is the missionary?\" He\r\nthen clasped the child to his bosom, while she was sobbing in anguish, her\r\nears caught his hurried breathing, his arms relaxed their hold, she looked\r\nup, he was gone.\r\n\r\nThere was mourning in the household, there was great mourning among the\r\npeople. The orator, the man of matchless gifts, of surpassing eloquence\r\nwas no more; and there were none to fill his place.\r\n\r\nRed Jacket desired after his death, a vial of cold water might be placed\r\nin his hand. His reason for this his friends did not understand. Red\r\nJacket felt that intemperance had been the bane of his life. Possibly from\r\nthis conviction he may have desired to be accompanied in his journey to\r\nthe spirit-land, by the beverage of which his better judgment most\r\napproved.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements of his funeral Red Jacket committed to his wife's son-in-\r\nlaw Wm. Jones. His friends, who belonged mostly to the Christian party,\r\nchose to have at his funeral the simple and appropriate services of that\r\nreligion. It was largely attended by his own race, and by the whites\r\nliving in that vicinity. He was buried in the mission burying ground,\r\nwhere were reposing many of his race, the aged and young, warrior, sachem,\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nHis death was at his residence near the church and mission-house at Seneca\r\nvillage on the 20th of January, 1830.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdano\r\nAlbany\r\nAlden, Pres.\r\nAlien's Hist.\r\nAngelica, N.
