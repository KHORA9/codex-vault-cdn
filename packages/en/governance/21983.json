IV.--JULY, 1863.--No. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMANCIPATION IN JAMAICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe luminous summary of statistical facts published in the March number\r\nof the _Atlantic Monthly_ for 1862, has, in a few pages, conclusively\r\nsettled the question whether emancipation in the smaller islands of the\r\nBritish West Indies has been a success or a failure. It applies the\r\nstandard of financial results, which, though the lowest, is undoubtedly\r\nthe best; for the defenders of slavery would hardly choose its moral\r\nadvantages as their strong position, and if its alleged economical\r\nadvantages turn out also an illusion, there is not much to be said for\r\nit. Indeed, of late they have been growing shy of the smaller islands,\r\nwhich furnish too many weapons for the other side, and too few for their\r\nown; and have chosen rather to divert attention from these by triumphant\r\nclamors about the forlorn condition of Jamaica. This magnificent island,\r\nonce the fairest possession of the British crown, now almost a\r\nwilderness, has been the burden of their lamentations over the fatal\r\nworkings of emancipation. And truly if emancipation has really done so\r\nmuch mischief in Jamaica as they claim, it is a most damaging fact.\r\nTestimony of opposite results in the smaller islands would hardly\r\ncountervail it. Such testimony would be good to prove that the freedom\r\nof the negro works well in densely peopled insular communities, where\r\nthe pressure of population compels industry. The opponents of\r\nemancipation are willing sometimes to acknowledge that where the\r\nlaboring population are, as they say, in virtual slavery to the\r\nplanters, by the impossibility of obtaining land of their own, their\r\nrelease from the degradation of being personally owned may act favorably\r\nupon them. But they maintain that where the negro can easily escape from\r\nthe control of the planter, as in Jamaica, where plenty of land is\r\nobtainable at low rates, his innate laziness is there invincible. This\r\nvery representation I remember to have seen a few years ago in a Jamaica\r\njournal in the planting interest, which maintained that unless the\r\nnegroes of that island were also reduced to 'virtual slavery'--using\r\nthose very words--by an immense importation of foreign laborers, it\r\nwould be impossible to bring them to reasonable terms.\r\n\r\nNow the condition of the South is like that of Jamaica, not like that of\r\nthe smaller islands. Were the Southern negroes emancipated, and should\r\nthey desert the plantations in a body, it is not likely that they would\r\nstarve. They could at least support themselves as well as the white\r\nsandhillers, and probably better, considering their previous habits of\r\nwork. Besides, as in Jamaica, there would of course be many small\r\nproprietors, who would be ruined by emancipation or before it, and from\r\nwhom the negroes could easily procure the few acres apiece that would be\r\nrequired by the wants of their rude existence. Jamaica, then, is far\r\nnearer a parallel to the South than most of the smaller islands, and for\r\nthis reason an inquiry into the true workings of emancipation there is\r\nof prime interest and importance.\r\n\r\nThe writer is very far indeed from pretending to have carried through\r\nsuch an inquiry. His personal acquaintance extends to but seven of the\r\ntwenty-two parishes of the island, and he is intimately acquainted with\r\nnot more than three of those seven. He has but a meagre knowledge of\r\nstatistical facts, bearing on the workings of emancipation in the\r\nisland, and indeed the statistics themselves, as Mr. Sewell complains,\r\nare very meagre and very hard to get. Still the writer has been able to\r\ngather some facts which will speak for themselves, and he claims for his\r\npersonal impressions on points concerning which he cannot give\r\nparticular facts the degree of confidence deserved by one who has\r\nresided five years and a half in a rural district, who has lived\r\nfamiliarly conversant with negroes and with whites of all classes, who\r\nhas heard all sides of the question from valued personal friends, and\r\nwho neither carried to Jamaica nor brought away from it any peculiar\r\ndisposition to an apotheosis of the negro character.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, an excess of candor affected by some writers on this\r\nquestion, which is neither honorable to them nor wholesome to their\r\nreaders. They would have us believe that they began their inquiries\r\nentirely undecided whether slavery or freedom is the normal condition of\r\nthe African race, and that their conclusions, whatever they are, have\r\nbeen purely deduced from the facts that they have gathered. The writer\r\nlays claim to no such comprehensive indifference. He would as soon think\r\nof suspending his faith in Christ until he could resolve all the\r\ndifficulties of the first of Genesis, as of suspending his moral\r\njudgment respecting the system which makes one man the brute instrument\r\nof another's gain, till he knew just how the statistics of sugar and\r\ncoffee stand. Woe unto us if the fundamental principles which govern\r\nhuman relations have themselves no better foundation than the\r\nfluctuating figures of blue-books!\r\n\r\nBut if freedom is better than slavery, she will be sure to vindicate her\r\nsuperiority in due time, and is little beholden to overzealous friends\r\nwho cannot be content meanwhile that present facts shall tell their own\r\nstory, whatever it be. There is much, very much, in the present\r\ncondition of Jamaica, to cause an honest man to think twice before\r\nsetting it down as testifying favorably for emancipation, or before\r\ndismissing it as not testifying unfavorably against it.\r\n\r\nAnd first, all rose-colored accounts of the Jamaica negro may be\r\nsummarily dismissed. He is not a proficient in industry, economy,\r\nintelligence, morality, or religion, but, though rising, is yet far down\r\non the scale in all these respects. Nor is it true that all his peculiar\r\nvices are to be referred to slavery. The sensuality, avarice, cunning,\r\nand litigiousness of the Creole[1] negro correspond exactly with Du\r\nChaillu's and Livingstone's descriptions of the native African.[2] But\r\non the other hand, the accounts of these travellers bear witness to a\r\nfreshness and independence of spirit in the native African, which has\r\nbeen crushed out of the enslaved negro. Several missionaries have gone\r\nfrom Jamaica to Africa, and they speak with delight of the manliness\r\nand vigor of character which they find among the blacks there, as\r\ncontrasted with the abjectness of those who have been oppressed by\r\nslavery and infected with its sly and cringing vices. Although the\r\nfaults of the negro, except this servile abjectness, may not have been\r\ncreated by slavery, yet slavery and heathenism are so identical in\r\ncharacter and tendency that there is scarcely a heathen vice, and, as we\r\nhave found of late to our sorrow, scarcely a heathen cruelty, which\r\nslavery would not create if it did not exist, and of course scarcely one\r\nalready existing which it does not foster and intensify. The unsocial\r\nselfishness of the emancipated black man, his untrustworthiness and want\r\nof confidence in others, are traits that his race may have brought with\r\nit from Africa, but they have been nourished by slavery, until it seems\r\nalmost impossible to eradicate them. I am happy to say, however, that\r\nthe young people who have been subjected to the best influences, exhibit\r\nalready the virtues of public spirit and faithfulness to a very\r\ngratifying degree. The trouble is that they are a minority of the whole.\r\nAnd until the character of the negroes can be so elevated as to bring\r\nthem to put some confidence in one another, they may improve in\r\nindividual industry, as they manifestly are improving, but the benefits\r\nresulting from combined action can be enjoyed only in a very limited\r\nmeasure. Even now two black men can hardly own so much as a small sugar\r\nmill in common. They are almost sure to quarrel over the division of the\r\nprofits. The consequence is, that, whereas they might have neighborhood\r\nmills and sugar works of the best quality at much less expense, now,\r\nwhere the small settlers raise the cane, each man must have his little\r\nmill and boilers to himself, at all the extra cost of money and labor\r\nthat it occasions. And so of savings banks and associations for\r\nprocuring medical aid, and a thousand other objects of public utility,\r\nwithout which a people must remain in the rudest state. Fortunately,\r\nhowever, the negro is strongly disposed to worship, and the church, that\r\nsociety out of which a thousand other societies have sprung, has a\r\nstrong hold upon him. Under the shelter of that, many other beneficent\r\nassociations will doubtless grow up.\r\n\r\nBut if rose-colored accounts of the freed negro are to be dismissed\r\nunceremoniously, on the other hand, the malignant representations which\r\nMr. Carlyle seems to find such a relish in believing deserve to be\r\nbranded as both false and wicked. His mythical negro, up to the ears in\r\n'pumpkin,' working half an hour a day, and not to be tempted by love or\r\nmoney to work more, would have been, during my whole residence in the\r\nisland, as great a curiosity to me as an ornithorhynchus. Doubtless\r\nsomething approaching to the phenomenon can be found; for a young\r\nScotchman, a friend of mine, who was appointed to take the census of a\r\nsecluded district, came to me after visiting it, and gave me an account\r\nof the people he had found in the bush, answering pretty nearly to Mr.\r\nCarlyle's description. But though he had been in the island from a boy,\r\nhe spoke of it with something of the surprise attending a new discovery.\r\nI should state, however, that my residence was in a district mostly\r\noccupied by small freeholders, and containing but few estates. In\r\nplanting districts the number of worthless, idle negroes is much larger.\r\nI have been assured that the negroes of the parish of Vere are\r\npeculiarly so. The men, I have been told, do scarcely any work, except\r\nin crop time; the women do none at all, not even to keep their houses\r\nneat. There is scarcely a cottage in the parish that has a bread-fruit\r\nor a cocoanut tree on its ground.[3] Everything is dirty and forlorn. On\r\nthe other hand, in Metcalfe and the adjoining parts of St. Andrew, and\r\nSt. Thomas in the Vale, although the mass of the working people have\r\ncertainly not learned much about comfort yet, still the number of neat,\r\nfloored, and glazed houses, the fruit trees on almost every negro plot,\r\nthe neat hibiscus hedges, with their gay red flowers, surrounding even\r\nthe poorer huts, the small cane fields and coffee pieces noticeable at\r\nevery turn, and the absence of loungers about the cottages, go to make\r\nup a very different picture from what has been drawn of Vere. It is\r\nplain, then, that the impressions which travellers bring away with them\r\nfrom Jamaica will vary almost to entire opposition, according to the\r\nquarters they have visited. Now what is the cause of these glaring\r\ncontrasts? The negro character is remarkably uniform. If there are great\r\ndifferences among them, every one that knows them will ascribe it to a\r\ndifference in circumstances. What is the difference then between\r\nMetcalfe and Vere? Simply this: Metcalfe is the home of small\r\nfreeholders; Vere is a sugar parish, where the estates are in prosperous\r\nactivity. It has been less affected by emancipation than any other\r\nparish. In Metcalfe the negroes are independent; in Vere they are\r\ncompletely subject to the planters. It is said that not even an ounce of\r\nsugar is permitted to be sold in the parish. All is for exportation. If\r\nthe writer then attempts to vindicate the character of the blacks from\r\nthe reproaches of incurable laziness and unthriftiness that have been\r\ncast upon it, he wishes it to be understood that he speaks only for the\r\nfreeholders, who have homes of their own, which they have an inducement\r\nto improve and beautify, and who have land of their own which no\r\ndishonest motive prompts them to neglect, and for the estate laborers\r\nwhose condition most nearly resembles theirs. If the blacks on many\r\nplantations are little disposed to adorn homes from which they may be\r\nejected at any time; if they are discouraged from the minor industries\r\nessential to comfort, lest these should interfere with the grosser labor\r\nrequired of them; if they are kept idle out of crop time for fear they\r\nshould not be available in crop time; if their mental improvement is\r\ndiscouraged by the planter instinct, unchanged in nature though\r\ncircumscribed in scope; if on many estates they are herded in barracks\r\nwhose promiscuous life debases still lower their already low morality;\r\nif their labors are directed for absentee masters by hired overseers,\r\nwhose interest is not to create a wholesome confidence between laborers\r\nand proprietors, but to get the most they can out of them during their\r\nown term of employment; if they are treated with the old slaveholding\r\narrogance, embittered by the consciousness of a check; and if thereby\r\nthe more self-respecting are driven off, and the more abject-spirited\r\nwho remain are rendered still more abject: I submit it is not fair to\r\nargue from this class of semi-slaves to the character of those who are\r\nreally free, who call no man master, who have a chance to be men if they\r\nwill, unhampered except by the general depressing influences that will\r\nalways work in a country where slavery has lately existed, and where the\r\nslaveholding class have still a predominant social and political\r\ninfluence. And it is to be noted that Carlyle's picture is drawn from\r\nthe neighborhood of a plantation, and so are Trollope's. Mr. Trollope,\r\nit is true, takes all imaginable pains to write himself down an ass. By\r\nhis own ostentatious confessions, the only intellectual\r\ncomprehensiveness to which he can lay claim is an astonishingly\r\ncomprehensive ignorance. In view of this, his sage discoursings upon\r\ngrave questions of political and social economy have about as comical an\r\neffect as the moralizings of a harlequin. But he is a lively describer\r\nof what passes under his eyes, and his sketches of what he heard and saw\r\namong the planters and on the plantations are doubtless authentic.\r\nHowever, he did not visit the small settlers; and to take pains to\r\ninform himself of the condition of a class of the population which he\r\nwas not among, except by catching up the dinner-table maledictions of\r\nhis planting friends against the class which they hate most, as being\r\nleast dependent on them, would be of course entirely contrary to his\r\nprofessed superficiality.\r\n\r\nThere are but two recent works of much value on emancipation in\r\nJamaica--Underhill's and Sewell's. The work of Mr. Underhill, although,\r\nas a delegate of a missionary society which had much to do in bringing\r\nabout emancipation, he might be supposed to have a strong party\r\ninterest, is marked by an impartial caution which entitles it to great\r\nrespect and confidence.[4]\r\n\r\nAs to Mr. Sewell's book, it is marvellous how he could obtain so clear\r\nan insight in so short a time into the true condition of things. The\r\npaucity of statistical facts, however, plagued him, as it does every\r\nwriter on Jamaica; and while the delinquencies of the planters are\r\npatent and palpable, he could not appreciate so well as a resident the\r\ndifficulties arising from the provoking treacherousness of the negro\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIt is known by most, who do not choose to remain conveniently ignorant,\r\nthat though the ruin of Jamaican planting prosperity has been\r\naccelerated by emancipation, it had been steadily going on for more than\r\na generation previous. In 1792 the Jamaica Assembly represented to\r\nParliament that in the twenty years previous one hundred and\r\nseventy-seven estates had been sold for debt. In 1800, it is stated in\r\nthe Hon. Richard Hill's interesting little book, 'Lights and Shadows of\r\nJamaica History,' judgments had been recorded against estates in the\r\nisland to the enormous amount of £33,000,000. In the five years before\r\nthe slave trade was abolished in 1807, sixty-five estates had been given\r\nup. Against the abolition of the slave trade the Assembly made the most\r\nurgent remonstrances, representing that it would be impossible to keep\r\nup the supply of labor without it. In other words, the slaves were\r\nworked to death so rapidly that natural increase alone would not\r\nmaintain their number. The result justified their prediction.[5] In\r\n1804, it appears that there were eight hundred and fifty-nine sugar\r\nestates in operation in the island. In 1834 there were six hundred and\r\nforty-six. In 1854 there were three hundred and thirty. Thus it appears\r\nthat in the thirty years previous to the abolition of slavery, one\r\nquarter of the estates in operation at the beginning of that term had\r\nbeen abandoned, and in the twenty years succeeding abolition one half of\r\nthose remaining had been given up. It is certainly no wonder that so\r\ngreat a social shock as emancipation, coming upon a tottering fabric,\r\nhastened its fall. But the foregoing facts show that, in the language\r\nof Mr. Underhill, 'ruin has been the chronic condition of Jamaica ever\r\nsince the beginning of the century.'\r\n\r\nThe distinguished historian of the island, Bryan Edwards, himself a\r\nplanter, and opposed to the abolition of the slave trade, describes the\r\nsugar cultivation, even before the supply of labor from Africa was cut\r\noff, as precarious in the highest degree, a mere lottery, and often, he\r\nsays, 'a millstone around the neck of the unfortunate proprietor.' That\r\nthis was from no invincible necessity, the uniform prosperity of\r\nnumerous estates shows. But these estates are all conducted\r\neconomically, while, on the other hand, reckless extravagance was the\r\nrule in the palmy days of the olden time, and has remained, even in\r\nhumbler circumstances, an inborn trait of the Creole gentleman.\r\n\r\nIf this was so during the continuance of the slave trade, what could\r\nhave been looked for when this means of obtaining labor was suddenly cut\r\noff? Sewell states the estimated supply of negroes from Africa necessary\r\nto make up the annual waste at ten thousand. When this ceased it was\r\nobvious that only such a complete revolution in the system of labor as\r\nshould save the horrible waste of life could preserve the plantations\r\nfrom ruin and the island from depopulation. But though the waste of life\r\nwas diminished, it still went on. Estate after estate had to be given up\r\nfor want of hands, at the same time that a constant decrease in the\r\nprice of sugar in London, amounting to fifty per cent between 1815 and\r\n1835, made it less and less profitable to work the remaining ones, and\r\nthus the planters were going steadily to ruin and the negro population\r\nsteadily to extinction, for almost a generation before emancipation. In\r\na memorial of the planters to Parliament in 1831, three years before\r\nabolition, they declare that without Parliamentary aid they are doomed\r\nto hopeless ruin. Already, they say, hundreds of respectable persons had\r\nbeen reduced almost to beggary by the precarious condition of the\r\nplanting interest. In this memorial they make no allusion to the\r\nanti-slavery agitations, which produced no serious effect in the colony\r\ntill 1832. Indeed the West Indian interest had been a notorious\r\nmendicant of old, and as in time a large part of West Indian estates had\r\ncome to be owned by the British aristocracy, this begging was not apt to\r\nbe in vain. Could Creole thriftlessness have been abolished and the\r\nslave trade retained, the ruin of the estates might have been averted.\r\nBut as human power was not adequate to the first, nor Christian\r\nconscience capable of the second, no course was left but to let planting\r\nprosperity go its own way to destruction, and endeavor at least to save\r\nthe population of the island from extermination. This emancipation\r\neffected, and this was its work. If it hastened the ruin of an interest\r\nwhich not even Parliamentary subsidies and high protective duties could\r\nprop up without the horrors of the middle passage, its trespass was\r\ncertainly a very venial one compared with its work of salvation.\r\nUndoubtedly the great transition from slavery to freedom might have been\r\nbetter managed had the planters, recognizing it as inevitable, concurred\r\nheartily in efforts to smoothe the passage. The emancipationists in\r\nParliament had at first no thought of immediate or even of speedy\r\nabolition. They did not suppose it wise or humane. Their first efforts\r\nmerely contemplated such ameliorations of the condition of the slaves as\r\ncommon decency and humanity would prompt. They brought the Imperial\r\nGovernment to propose to the slaveholding colonies the enactment of laws\r\nabolishing the flogging of females, mitigating punishments, allowing the\r\nslaves to testify in court in cases to which whites were parties,\r\nproviding for their religious instruction, appointing guardians of their\r\nscanty rights, giving them one week day for themselves, and restricting\r\narbitrary sales of slaves. Not one of the colonies would agree to a\r\nsingle one of these measures. That peculiar obstinacy which slaveholding\r\ndominion seems to engender, made them, as with us, bent on having all or\r\nnothing. All hopes of instituting a gradual preparation for freedom\r\nbeing thus defeated by the stubborn refusal of the slaveholders to\r\nconcur, speedy emancipation became a necessity. But even yet the\r\nabolitionists had not learned that if slaves are to be set free from\r\ntheir masters, the more quickly they are put out of their hands the\r\nbetter. A muzzled wolf, appointed to keep sheep he would much rather\r\neat, would make about as amiable a custodian as masters allowed to\r\nexercise a limited authority over bondmen whom they have hitherto always\r\nhad at their own will, and know they are about to lose altogether. I\r\nthink it is generally agreed that the few years of apprenticeship were\r\nmore plague than profit to all parties, and made the alienation between\r\nproprietors and laborers still more complete. At the same time, as the\r\nhours of labor were limited to eight, and Saturday was secured to the\r\napprentices for themselves, the negroes fell into a way of thinking that\r\nthey could only work those eight hours anyhow, and must have an idle\r\ntime on the Saturday; and this notion continued to foster indolence for\r\na good while after they were their own masters. The short time, too,\r\nwhich the planters knew they should have them at their control,\r\nnaturally stimulated them to make the most of them meanwhile. One\r\ngentleman in Metcalfe, for instance, laid out a thousand acres of coffee\r\non a newly enlarged property, and gave orders to transfer a gang of\r\nnegroes from an estate of his some twelve miles distant. The negroes\r\ncling like oysters to their birthplace, and they flatly refused to leave\r\ntheir grounds and their friends. The master summoned policemen, and had\r\nthem cruelly flogged till they consented to go. Apprenticeship was\r\nabolished two years earlier than he had reckoned on, and the laborers\r\nthus forcibly transferred left him then in a body, and the thousand\r\nacres of coffee went to ruin. Had some Trollope chanced then to be\r\ntravelling through that quarter, and been entertained by the\r\ndisappointed proprietor with all the noble bounteousness which\r\ndistinguished him, we can easily imagine how this fact would have\r\nfigured in his book, as a proof of unconquerable negro laziness.\r\n\r\nIt was peculiarly unfortunate for Jamaica at this juncture, that the\r\nestates were mostly managed by attorneys and overseers for absentee\r\nlandlords. Middlemen, it is said, ruined Ireland, and it is certain that\r\nthey have helped mightily to ruin Jamaica. If attorneys had been ever so\r\nhonest, how could they be efficient, when one attorney had very commonly\r\nthe charge of four, six, ten, or even fourteen estates? If he paid a\r\nhasty visit to each one once in two years he did well. And as to\r\noverseers, how could honesty be expected when common morality was not\r\npermitted? It was a rule, having almost the force of law, that an\r\noverseer, if he married, was at once dismissed.[6] Loose licentiousness\r\nand loose dishonesty are very apt to go hand in hand, and it is certain\r\nthat they did in Jamaica. A saying still in use among the whites of the\r\nisland illustrates the standard of integrity: 'Make me your executor,\r\nand I do not ask you to make me your heir.' No wonder that estates went\r\ndown like a row of bricks, one after another, when they had such\r\nmanagers. Had Jamaica been occupied at the time of emancipation by a\r\nresident proprietary, it is not likely that even they could have so far\r\novercome their despotic habits and contempt for the negro as to treat\r\nthe laboring population with fairness, and what they value still more,\r\nwith decent respect. But still less could it be expected of the\r\noverseers that they would exercise foresight and self-control enough to\r\nretain the good will of the blacks. They had all the feelings of\r\nslaveholders, aggravated by more direct contact with the slaves, while\r\ntheir interest only bound them to make the most out of the estates\r\nduring their own term of employment, no matter if they took a course\r\nthat would ruin them eventually. Besides, an overseer must have been\r\noften tempted to work on the fears of a proprietor, just after\r\nemancipation, to persuade him to sell the estate to him; and many a one\r\nwould not hesitate to ruin the property to bring down its price to his\r\nown means, knowing that the sale of the land or its conversion to\r\npasturage would reimburse him.\r\n\r\nThe various means by which the planters endeavored to keep the negroes\r\non the estates are too well known to require detail. Summary ejectments\r\nof the refractory from their dwellings, destruction of their provision\r\ngrounds, refusal to sell them land except at exorbitant prices, were all\r\ntried. But there is too much land in Jamaica, and too few people, to\r\nmake this game successful. There were abundance of thrown-up estates,\r\nand especially of coffee properties in the mountains, whose owners were\r\nonly too glad to sell land at reasonable rates, and so this policy of\r\ncoercion simply wrought out an incurable alienation between a large part\r\nof the proprietors and a large part of the peasantry. It must not be\r\nsupposed, however, that the tyranny was all on one side. If at\r\nemancipation there was an unprincipled strife on the part of the\r\nplanters to get the better of the negroes, there was an equally\r\nunprincipled and far more adroitly managed strife on the part of the\r\nnegroes to get the better of the planters. Long and close observation of\r\nthe emancipated black has satisfied the writer beyond all doubt that\r\nlaziness is not one of his prominent faults. Negligent, unthrifty,\r\ncareless of time, and sufficiently disposed to take his ease, he\r\nundoubtedly is. But every year of freedom has shown an advance, and the\r\nfive years and a half of the writer's residence showed so unmistakable\r\nan advance in regular industry, carefulness of time, skill in laying out\r\nlabor, and in the increase of the wants that stimulate industry, that\r\nhis early misgivings as to the capacity and disposition of the freed\r\nnegro to take care of himself were finally put to rest. But a\r\ndisposition to take care of himself and a disposition to be faithful to\r\nthe interests of others are two very different things. At emancipation,\r\nthe negroes' stimulants to making money were very strong. In the first\r\nimpulse of their zeal they were everywhere erecting chapels and schools,\r\nraising large sums for the support of their ministers and schoolmasters;\r\nthey were everywhere building houses, buying land, and laying the\r\nfoundation of that settled well-being which time has continually made\r\nfirmer. Then, too, money was plentiful, sugar bore a high price, and,\r\nnotwithstanding the churlishness of many planters, more, perhaps, were\r\neager to retain their hands by offering the highest possible wages, and\r\neven higher in many cases than the estates would bear. Nor were the\r\nblacks at all averse to making money. But though the Jamaica negro does\r\nnot object to work, he dearly loves to cheat. The keenest Yankee that\r\never skinned a flint, cannot approach him in trickiness. This native\r\ntrait has been sharpened to the utmost by the experience of slavery,\r\nwhich left him with the profound conviction that 'Buckra'[7] was fair\r\nplunder. The poor fellow could not be very severely blamed for thinking\r\nthus, for certainly he had been fair plunder for Buckra from time\r\nimmemorial. Accordingly, the first few years after emancipation appear\r\non many estates to have been passed in a continual struggle on the part\r\nof the negroes to see how much they could get out of the planters and\r\nhow little they could give in return. They knew they had the whip hand\r\nof massa, and they were not slow to profit by the knowledge. They would\r\nsaunter to their work at eight or nine o'clock in the morning, dawdle\r\nthrough it with intensely provoking unfaithfulness till three or four in\r\nthe afternoon, and then would raise a prodigious uproar if they were not\r\npaid as liberally as if they had done an honest day's work. The poor\r\nplanter meanwhile was at his wits' end. It was of no use to turn them\r\noff and hire another set, for, like the fox in the fable, he knew he\r\nshould only fare the worse. If the estate was large enough to stand the\r\nstrain for two or three years, and the manager was a man of self-control\r\nenough to keep his temper, and firmness enough to persevere in a\r\nwinnowing of the whole region round about, treating them meanwhile with\r\ndecency, and paying them honestly and promptly, he would at last be able\r\nto get a set of trusty hands, and give all the negroes of the\r\nneighborhood such an understanding of him that they would be ready, if\r\nthey went to work for him, to leave off cheating, and honestly earn\r\ntheir wages. A friend of mine took an abandoned estate in 1854, and\r\nthough for two or three years he was tortured like a bear at a stake, he\r\nsucceeded at last, by the most scrupulous fairness on his own part, and\r\nby not tolerating the least dishonesty in a hand, in creating such a\r\npublic sentiment among his laborers, that for their own credit they\r\nwould themselves expose the dishonesty of a comrade. Now, he has as many\r\nlaborers, and profitable ones, as he needs. But how many planters could\r\nbe expected to have the principle or patience to carry out such a course\r\nof discipline? The ruin of the estates, or rather the acceleration of\r\ntheir inevitable ruin, is justly attributed, in large measure, to the\r\nplanters, to their imperious bearing toward the enfranchised blacks, to\r\ntheir harsh expedients for keeping in dependence the large and much the\r\nbest class of blacks, who wanted to become freeholders, to the slackness\r\nand unfaithfulness with which the wages of the people were often paid,\r\nto the debasing influences of the plantation, which drove off the more\r\nself-respecting, and to the waste, dishonesty, and shortsightedness\r\ninevitable in the management of several hundred estates mainly by\r\nmiddlemen. But on the other hand, it is not to be forgotten that the\r\nAfrican barbarian, brought a heathen from home, and plunged into the\r\ndeeper darkness of a compulsory heathenism, rigorously secluded by\r\njealous cupidity from every ray of intellectual, and, so far as\r\npossible, of spiritual light, liable to cruel punishment if he snatched\r\na few hours from his rest or his leisure to listen to the missionary,\r\nfrom whom alone he heard words of heavenly comfort or of human sympathy,\r\ncondemned to a lifetime of unrequited labor--it must not be forgotten\r\nthat he could not fail to come out from this school of supreme\r\ndishonesty with its lessons so deeply imprinted on his mind that not one\r\ngeneration or two would eradicate them, and that of all others he would\r\nbe most inclined to practise them upon the white man, whom, having\r\nalways known as a plunderer, he was only too glad to have an opportunity\r\nto plunder in return. Had Jamaica been occupied by a resident\r\nproprietary, attached by hereditary affection and pride to the soil,\r\nelevated by family sanctities, connected by something like kindly ties\r\nwith their bondmen, and regarded by these in turn with something of\r\naffectionate fealty, in that case, although it is not likely that the\r\nruin of the plantations could have been averted, it might have been\r\ndelayed and mitigated. Mr. Underhill indeed goes further, and quotes the\r\ntestimony of an overseer in the west of the island, that he knew of no\r\nestate managed, since emancipation, by a resident owner, which had not\r\ncontinued profitable. But a class of hirelings, debased in morals by the\r\ncruel selfishness of their employers, tempted almost irresistibly to\r\nunfaithfulness by the five thousand miles of ocean between them and\r\ntheir principals, and to recklessness and tyranny by the uncertain\r\ntenure of their places, and connected with the slaves by none but the\r\ngrossest and most sordid ties--such management, in such a crisis, when\r\nthe ties of old subjection were suddenly dissolved, and the negro stood\r\nindependent, and knowing his independence, before his masters, would\r\nhave ruined any country under the sun.\r\n\r\nAs to the present condition of the emancipated blacks, it is certain\r\nthat the 7,340 freeholds which had been acquired in 1840, two years\r\nafter emancipation, have considerably increased in number. I never heard\r\nof a negro freehold being given up,[8] while I did know of continual\r\npurchases of land by the blacks, either to make new holdings or to\r\nextend old ones.\r\n\r\nThe parish of Hanover is one in which happily the various classes are in\r\na good degree united in feeling. The Hanover Society of Industry\r\nprepared a report about three years ago, quoted by Mr. Underhill, which\r\nshows that in that parish about seven eighths of the people are on\r\nholdings of their own, of which 891 consist of 1 acre, 431 of 2 acres,\r\nand 802 average 5-1/4 acres each. Each family on an average consists of\r\n4-1/2 persons, and cultivates something over an acre, securing an income\r\nof about £28. Those who own land are five times as numerous as those who\r\nonly hire it. The annual value of produce from the small holdings,\r\nestimated at £28 for each (£2 less than the society's estimate), is\r\nabout £60,000. There are, besides, 29 estates having 3,675 acres under\r\ncultivation, and employing 2,760 laborers, of whom two thirds are\r\nfemales.[9] About one eighth of the population is at work upon them.\r\nThese estates average 2,608 hogsheads of sugar, and 1,435 puncheons of\r\nrum. Of the whole area of the estates, 3,555 acres are in pasturage, and\r\n28,552 acres inaccessible or ruinate. There are, besides, 151 small\r\nproperties of 20 acres and upward. In six districts, comprising about\r\none fourth of the parish, there were found 143 small cane mills, valued\r\nat £10 apiece, which turned out, in 1859, 455 barrels of sugar, worth\r\nabout £900, to say nothing of the pork fattened on the refuse molasses.\r\nOne district of the six, constituting the quarter of the parish\r\nexamined, produced, in 1857, 146 barrels; in 1858, 227 barrels; in 1859,\r\n261 barrels.\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty fair picture of what may be expected in parishes where\r\nthe whites show some regard for the blacks; not very magnificent\r\nresults, it is true, but showing the disposition of the people to\r\nprocure land of their own, and their increasing disposition to add to\r\nthe raising of provisions the cultivation of the great staple of the\r\nsoil. The report of the Society of Industry bears the following\r\ntestimony to their character: 'The peasantry are, generally speaking,\r\nindustrious and well behaved, and are gradually becoming more\r\ncomfortable in their worldly circumstances. In the town of Lucea there\r\nhas been a decided increase in the amount of business within the last\r\nthree years as compared with a number of years previously.' In Hanover,\r\nin 1845, there were 70 estates in operation. In 1860 there were only 29.\r\nThe planters of this parish, however, do not lay the blame on the\r\nnegroes, but attribute the decline to the mountainous character of the\r\nparish, which made it unprofitable to continue the estates after the\r\ngreat fall in the price of sugar.\r\n\r\nNow the blacks of Hanover are just the same race as the rest of the\r\nnegro population of the island. The only difference is that the whites\r\nof that parish, instead of treating them with contempt and neglect, have\r\nshown something of courtesy and care toward them. The numerous\r\nconversations which Mr. Underhill reports with the owners and managers\r\nof successful estates show how simple are the rules by which they secure\r\nsuccess. To manifest a decent respect for the blacks, to be firm, but\r\ntemperate and fair in dealing with them, to use the best improvements in\r\nmachinery, and to exercise a strict economy of management--this appears\r\nto be the sum of the difference between prosperous and unprosperous\r\nplantations, provided of course that both are equally well situated for\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nMetcalfe, the writer's residence during most of his stay in Jamaica, is,\r\nlike Hanover, a parish of small freeholders, but unlike Hanover, the\r\nblacks and the few whites are not on good terms. Excepting what has been\r\ndone by missionaries, which is not a little, they are little indebted to\r\nany but themselves for their prosperity. And as one charged with their\r\nreligious instruction, the writer can bear witness that for several\r\nyears they have needed to be restrained from avarice more than to be\r\nstimulated to industry. A clergyman, a friend of mine, humorously\r\ncomplained that he had lost by stirring up his people to work, for that\r\nnow they were so diligently employed upon their own places, that he\r\ncould get scarcely anybody to work for him. The average number of acres\r\nowned by forty families, of which I made lists, is seven--a pretty fair\r\nestimate, I should judge, of the whole; and seven acres in Jamaica is\r\nequivalent in productiveness to a much larger amount here. One fourth\r\nhad floored houses, and as large a proportion had sugar mills. Many of\r\nthe families have one or two horses, worth commonly from £5 to £12\r\napiece. Not a few have mules, which are much more valuable; and nearly\r\nall the rest have donkeys. The proportion of floored and glazed houses,\r\nsome of them shingled, is steadily though not very rapidly increasing;\r\nand I need not say that in that climate, and with their yet rudimentary\r\nideas of comfort, a floor of earth is no indication of indigence.\r\n\r\nThe holdings vary from one to forty acres, but are more commonly from\r\nthree to six. Almost every freeholder hires land besides, and a great\r\ndeal of time is lost in going to distant pieces of ground. The wants of\r\nthe people have increased faster than they reckoned on, and the land was\r\nbought up so rapidly around them that now they are subject to this\r\ndisadvantage in making new purchases. In St. Ann, the Baptist\r\ncongregations alone spent £10,000 in a few years in buying land.\r\n\r\nThe furniture of the poorer houses is miserably scanty; £3 would more\r\nthan cover it. But the better houses, now multiplying year by year,\r\nboast their four-post bedsteads, often of the native mahogany, sometimes\r\nmahogany chairs, and corresponding articles. If a white family, on\r\nremoving, expose their furniture to sale, it is caught up by the people\r\nwith eagerness at almost any price asked. The very improvidence of the\r\nnegroes stimulates their industry. They are exceedingly litigious, and\r\nexceedingly ostentatious on the few grand occasions they enjoy.[10]\r\nThese luxuries, especially the former, cost them dear, but their very\r\nexpense makes it the more necessary to work to find the means of\r\nindulging in them. Remunerative labor is eagerly sought after. The\r\nmagnificent road now building through the island and traversing the\r\nparish of Metcalfe, has a superfluity of workmen, notwithstanding the\r\nshameful unfairness with which they have often been treated by the\r\nsuperintendents. I have known the people go in numbers to an estate ten\r\nmiles distant, and remain there for weeks, except on the Saturdays and\r\nSundays, away from their homes, working hard at digging and embanking,\r\nbecause they could secure one and sixpence sterling a day. I have often\r\nhad occasion to employ men on short jobs, and though not unfrequently\r\nobliged to wait some time before securing a workman, I never suffered\r\ndelay because they were too idle, but because they were too busy to\r\nattend to me. During my residence among them their progress in industry\r\nbecame too marked to be overlooked. However negligent our observations,\r\nwe could not fail to notice the increasing patches of cane in some\r\nquarters, the extending provision grounds in others, the multiplying\r\nhouses of the better sort, the earlier hours of going to the field, and\r\nthe later hours coming from it at night. A firm in Kingston, accustomed\r\nto sell the implements of negro labor, found the demand for tools\r\nincreasing faster than they could supply it. And we were glad to find\r\nthat they were becoming not merely more industrious, but more skilful in\r\ntheir industry. A friend, who had much to do with them, assured me that\r\nthe young men greatly surpass their parents in forecast in the laying\r\nout of labor, and had got over the miserliness shown by the old people\r\nin providing means for carrying it on. He said a few years before he\r\ncould not have sold a good tool, and now he could not sell a bad one. An\r\nold negro, he remarked, would groan over a sixpence extra in buying a\r\ntool; the young man would say: 'Come, let us have things in good style\r\nat the start, and our profits will soon pay for them.' Not that habits\r\nof industry are so confirmed that there are not a good many local and\r\ntemporary relapses into the old careless ways. But the relapses are\r\nfitful, the advance is steady. Of course, with growing means their wants\r\nrise, and increasing wants in turn react happily upon their industry.\r\nThe friend to whom I have several times referred, and who, being both a\r\nmissionary and a proprietor, is placed in a pretty impartial equipoise\r\nof judgment, remarks that if some of those at home who imagine the\r\nJamaica negro as lying lazily in the sun, eating bananas, could see the\r\nbill of fare of a good many black men, and compare it with what they\r\nwere used to eat in time of slavery, they would probably be rather\r\nastonished. His estate is not large, but I remember that he has been\r\nunable for several weeks in the height of the sugar season to put up a\r\nbarrel of sugar, on account of the people's buying it off in small\r\nquantities as fast as it was made. The many families that have small\r\nmills, of course, supply their own wants fully before they sell, and\r\nthey commonly prefer selling the surplus among their neighbors to taking\r\nit down to the exporters. Thus it appears that the diminution in the\r\nexports of Jamaica is not wholly owing to the decrease of production.\r\nMr. Underhill says he was assured by an overseer that the present\r\nconsumption of sugar by the people of Jamaica was much greater\r\nproportionately than its use by the English, and there can be no doubt\r\nof this. It was very different in slavery. Undoubtedly there is less\r\nproduced, much less, for production is diminished by the want of the ten\r\nthousand men a year that were used up to keep it at its highest point.\r\nNaturally, freemen prefer their own lives to the extra hogsheads of\r\nsugar that can be turned out by sacrificing them. It is also diminished\r\nby the steady fall in the price of sugar, which has made a difference\r\nbetween 1815 and 1850 of seventy-five per cent., rendering the\r\ninveterate extravagance of old management ruinous. It is diminished\r\nbecause slavery ruined confidence and good will between owners and\r\nlaborers. It is diminished because an immense amount of labor has been\r\ndiverted to the establishment of the homes, churches, and schools of a\r\nprosperous yeomanry. It is diminished because the growth of family life,\r\nthough feeble and struggling, has withdrawn from the field wholly, or in\r\npart, thousands of women and children. It is diminished because higher\r\nthan bodily necessities now consume time that was once rigorously denied\r\nto them. And lastly, it is diminished because the alienation caused by\r\nslavery has thrown upon themselves thousands of the emancipated bondmen,\r\nformerly accustomed to labor only as mechanical implements, to acquire\r\nskill, economy, and thrift by a long course of untutored experiments. On\r\nthe other hand, much that is now produced makes no figure in the markets\r\nof the world, because it is consumed by the people themselves, no longer\r\nkept, for the profit of masters, at the lowest point at which they could\r\nmaintain an animal existence. And not only do they consume so much, but\r\nthey have enough left to buy from abroad whatever their increased\r\nnecessities cannot find at home. It was not so in the good old times.\r\nThen the money that was made was sent to England to be spent by noble\r\nand gentle landlords there, and little good did Jamaica get of it. So\r\nlittle indeed was the island thought of even by the residents as a place\r\nto spend money on, so much as a place to get money in that was to be\r\nspent in England, that, as Mr. Sewell remarks, good roads have begun to\r\nbe built, to any considerable extent, only since freedom. Forlorn as\r\nKingston is, it was always forlorn; and not till slavery was abolished\r\ndid they think to introduce the water which is now supplied in such\r\nabundance to the city. A rude profusion of luxury was all the planters\r\naimed at till they could get home to the refinements of the mother\r\ncountry. In a word, in time of slavery, Jamaica was simply an\r\naggregation of sugar and coffee mills, kept running by a stream of human\r\nblood. Now it is a land whose inhabitants are free to live for\r\nthemselves and for God, to enjoy the gifts of His hand, and to send into\r\nthe markets of the world, not a surplus which has cost one hundred\r\nhecatombs of men each year, but a surplus which has cost no life, but\r\nwhose rich fruits come back to cheer and adorn thousands of lives.\r\nCommerce may have lost by the change, and there may be some jewels the\r\nless in the coronets of English nobility, but we may be permitted to\r\nbelieve that Christ and humanity have no reason to grieve.\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought, however, that estates are going down as rapidly\r\nnow as formerly. Indeed, for a few years, I question whether more have\r\nnot been resumed than abandoned. In 1855 the value of exports of the\r\nfour staples, coffee, pimento, rum, and sugar, was £786,429; in 1856,\r\n£814,659; in 1857, £1,141,472. I have not the statistics of the years\r\nfollowing. This check to the ruin of the estates is a matter of\r\nrejoicing, for the entire abandonment of the island by the whites would\r\nbe a great disaster. As Mr. Underhill well observes, the ascendency of\r\nthe white man is needed to temper the enmity between the browns and the\r\nblacks. The former, who constitute about one fifth of the population,\r\nalthough sharing the wealth and intelligence of the whites, are regarded\r\nwith strong dislike by the blacks. Hayti shows how dangerous it is to\r\nleave these two elements in a society without a moderating force. I\r\ncannot share the pleasure with which some anticipate the complete\r\nAfricanization of the West Indies. European intelligence, European\r\nconscience, and European firmness of will are necessary to insure to the\r\nblacks the permanence of those rich blessings which emancipation has\r\nbestowed. The black man has the industry and is daily improving in the\r\nskill necessary to secure his material well-being; but for very many\r\nyears to come, it would be a most disastrous thing for him, hazarding\r\nthe loss of all that he has gained, to be deprived of either the\r\nreligious or the political oversight of the white race. The planters of\r\nJamaica are not distinguished by a very rigid morality or a very severe\r\nintegrity, but their withdrawal would inflict incurable harm on\r\nintelligence, order, industry, and civilization. They may be\r\ncontemptuously indifferent to the moral and intellectual improvement of\r\nthe blacks, but they have no longer a lively interest in opposing it. By\r\nthis time they are gradually becoming convinced that the spirit of\r\nslavery cannot be maintained when its power is gone, and are growing\r\ndisposed, so far as they have dealings with the blacks, to deal with\r\nthem on more equal terms. Bare justice may be the most they are willing\r\nto accord, but even that is a great gain. The journals in their interest\r\nno longer lavish on the freeholding blacks the abuse with which they\r\nonce teemed, even after the writer went to the island. The planters are\r\nwilling to admit, like those of Westmoreland in an appeal to the\r\nAssembly in behalf of immigration, 'that they do not find fault with\r\nthe difficulty of getting labor, which is a necessary result of the\r\neasy acquisition of land,' The more candid are willing to say, as I\r\nheard a gentleman of their class observe: 'We do not complain of the\r\nnegroes; they have done as well for themselves perhaps as any people\r\nwould. But just because they are doing so well for themselves, they\r\ncannot be depended on to do well for us.' Hence the call for immigrant\r\nlaborers; a just and reasonable call, if only the immigration is\r\nconducted with that rigid and conscientious care for the comfort of the\r\nimmigrants for which Mr. Sewell gives the government of Trinidad credit,\r\nand if it is really voluntary. The fear that it will injure the negro,\r\nor that he dreads it, is wholly baseless. The negroes have remained\r\nutterly indifferent to the whole agitation of the subject, and are on\r\nperfectly amiable terms with the few coolies already introduced. Indeed\r\nit will be rather for their interest, as a negro remarked to Mr.\r\nUnderhill, by giving them a better sale for their produce. The coolies\r\nnow in the island appear to have done well. And the danger of\r\novercrowding the population on a land teeming with tropical plenty,\r\nwhose area of 6,400 square miles is occupied by but 441,000 inhabitants,\r\nis not a very imminent one, from any number within the means of the\r\ncolony to introduce. And on the ability to procure foreign labor very\r\nmuch depends the hope of reviving the planting prosperity of Jamaica on\r\na sounder basis, and in such a degree as is compatible with the\r\nsubstantial good of the whole population. It is true the population,\r\nrelieved from the dreadful waste of slavery, is increasing. The census\r\nof 1844 showed a population of 377,433. That of 1861 showed one of\r\n441,264, an increase of 63,831 in seventeen years. The immigration of\r\ncoolies during that time has been between 18,000 and 20,000; the\r\ndecrease of the whites, 3,000. The net increase by immigration then has\r\nbeen at the most 17,000, leaving 47,000 as the natural increase, or 12\r\nper cent., in seventeen years. This is what remains after two terrible\r\nvisitations of cholera, and one of small pox, all within eleven years,\r\nwhich together are computed to have swept off 40,000 persons. The\r\nincrease would doubtless be much greater but for the loose living and\r\ncareless habits of the negroes, and their almost entire destitution of\r\nmedical attendance. There are now, it appears, but fifty qualified\r\npractitioners in the island, with no hopes of reinforcement.\r\n\r\nThe results of this census were very gratifying, and very unexpected.\r\nSuch scanty means are there, ordinarily, of knowing the true condition\r\nof the country, that it was a prevailing impression that the population\r\nwas decreasing. Had slavery continued, the present population would\r\nprobably have been about 275,000. The difference of 165,000 in favor of\r\nfreedom tells its own story. But the present necessities of the estates\r\ncall for a more speedy augmentation of the laboring force than is\r\nfurnished by natural increase alone.\r\n\r\nI have omitted to mention in its proper place one gratifying sign that\r\nthose minor industries which make so large a part of the prosperity of\r\nthe wealthiest free communities, but which are neglected by the coarse\r\nlabor of slaves, and have been particularly despised by the Jamaica\r\nplanters, are now coming up in the island. Hitherto, sugar, rum, and\r\ncoffee have been the all in all of prosperity to Jamaicans. But in 1838,\r\nthe pimento export was 2,708,640 pounds; in 1858, 9,465,261 pounds. In\r\n1838 the export of logwood was 8,432 cwt.; of fustic, 2,126 cwt.; of\r\nmahogany, 1,936 feet; of cocoanuts, 0; of honey, 0. In 1859, the export\r\nof logwood was 14,006 cwt.; of fustic, 2,329 cwt.; of mahogany, 35,000\r\nfeet; of cocoanuts, 712,913; of honey, 6,954 pounds. The ginger export\r\nhas diminished from 1,834,120 pounds in 1841, to 709,620 pounds in 1858.\r\nThis increase in the lesser articles of trade shows a brisker\r\ncirculation in the capillaries of the social system, a sure token of\r\nreviving health. Indeed, before the writer left the island, that dreary\r\nuncertainty how affairs were turning, which prevailed for the first half\r\nof his stay, had given way to the returning cheerfulness arising from\r\nthe feeling that Jamaica had touched bottom, and that henceforward,\r\nhowever slowly, her prospects were brightening. This cheerful feeling\r\ndisplays itself in a late report of Governor Darling to the Home\r\nGovernment, some paragraphs of which follow, quoted from Mr. Underhill's\r\nbook, from which the writer has derived so large a part of the facts\r\nthat he has had to take at second hand, and which he is glad again to\r\ncommend as kindly, impartial, and full of carefully gathered and exactly\r\nappreciated information. His conjectural estimates of property, however,\r\nare exceptionable, as decidedly too high.\r\n\r\nGovernor Darling, himself a planter, says:\r\n\r\n     'The proportion of those who are settling themselves industriously\r\n     on their holdings, and rapidly rising in the social scale, while\r\n     commanding the respect of all classes of the community, and some of\r\n     whom are, to a limited extent, themselves the employers of hired\r\n     labor, paid for either in money or in kind, is, I am happy to\r\n     think, not only steadily increasing, but at the present moment is\r\n     far more extensive than was anticipated by those who are cognizant\r\n     of all that took place in the colony in the earlier days of negro\r\n     freedom.\r\n\r\n     'There can be no doubt, in fact, that an independent, respectable,\r\n     and, I believe, trustworthy middle class is rapidly forming.... If\r\n     the real object of emancipation was to place the freedman in such a\r\n     position that he might work out his own advancement in the social\r\n     scale, and prove his capacity for the full and rational enjoyment\r\n     of personal independence, secured by constitutional liberty,\r\n     Jamaica will afford more instances, even in proportion to its large\r\n     population, of such gratifying results, than any land in which\r\n     African slavery once existed.\r\n\r\n     'Jamaica, at this moment, presents, I believe, at once the\r\n     strongest proof of the complete success of the great measure of\r\n     emancipation, as relates to the capacity of the emancipated race\r\n     for freedom, and the most unfortunate instance of a descent in the\r\n     scale of agricultural and commercial importance as a colonial\r\n     community.'\r\n\r\nGovernor Darling's words suggest the exact reason why Jamaica may be\r\nlooked upon either as the most fortunate or the most unfortunate of the\r\nemancipated colonies. All depends upon the point of view. If the largest\r\namount of individual well-being and the most favorable conditions of\r\ngaining independence and self-respect constitute a community fortunate,\r\nthen Jamaica stands at the head of her island sisters. If immense\r\nwealth, centred in a few, constitutes a community fortunate, then\r\nBarbados is at the head. In Barbados the wealth of the planters is\r\ngreater, in Jamaica the condition of the laborers is better. The late\r\nMr. Sewell remarked to the writer that the common people in Jamaica had\r\na more manly and self-respecting look than in any of the smaller islands\r\nwhich he had visited. It is much to be lamented that the divorce between\r\nthe proprietary and the laboring interest was so complete in this\r\nisland, and the consequent industrial anarchy so great. But even this\r\nwas better than the depressed condition in which the peasantry of the\r\nsmaller islands are kept by the hold that the planters have upon them.\r\nManhood is a better crop than either sugar or coffee, and in the long\r\nrun brings all other things with it. The article in the March number of\r\nthe _Atlantic Monthly_ for 1862, shows, in brief compass, what\r\ninestimable benefits have followed in the smaller islands from\r\nconferring the boon of personal freedom, even with so stringent a social\r\ndependence remaining. In Jamaica, freedom has been more complete, and\r\nthe recoil of the social elements from each other more violent. The\r\ndisaffection of the governing class has also been greater, and Freedom\r\nhas been left to take care of herself.[11] But though thwarted and\r\nfrowned upon, she is at the last justified of her children. Mr. Sewell\r\nhas most happily hit the whole truth in a few lines: 'The crop' (of\r\nfreedom), he says, 'appears in patches, even as it was sown, forcing\r\nitself here and there through the ruins of the fabric which disfigures\r\nstill the political complexion of the island, and sorely cramps the\r\nenergies of its people.' Governor Darling's words show how rapidly the\r\ncrop, thus negligently sown, is forcing itself into prosperous and\r\nprevailing growth.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Negro of West Indian birth.

It is no trifle, as every\r\none knows, in a small village, to be accounted its richest man, but that\r\nwas the least of Abijah's honors. It appears by record that Abijah\r\nmaintained the responsible--and, since Squire Adams has been gathered to\r\nhis fathers, the solitary--dignity of justice of the peace in and for\r\nthe county of which East Hampton formed a highly respectable portion. It\r\nwas not the mere flourish of 'Esq.' at the end of the great man's\r\nname--it was the essence of the great man himself. It found him, as he\r\nwas proud to think, an ordinary, commonplace individual. The good people\r\nof East Hampton saw what it had made him, and trembled. And well they\r\nmight, where justice herself, in the person of the magistrate, stood in\r\nawe of her own responsibility and power.\r\n\r\nWe have been told that, at the outset of Squire Witherpee's\r\nadministration, he held his breath at the thought of venturing upon\r\njudicial grounds with much the same uneasiness that the tyro in science\r\nexhibits in some new and hazardous experiment. The honors of office had\r\ngrown scarcely a week old upon him, when opportunity offered for a full\r\ndisplay of the 'feeling and perspiration' (to borrow the words of our\r\ninformant) 'with which he dispensed justice at the lowest cash price.'\r\n\r\nIt was bright and early one winter morning that two tall, raw old\r\nfarmers drove up to the 'West India Goods and General Emporium'\r\nestablishment, and emerging from an avalanche of buffalo robes, made\r\ngood their way into the back part of the store, where the customary knot\r\nof hangers-on was gathered around the stove, to drag through the day,\r\ndoing nothing and talking politics. A single look convinced the\r\nproprietor that he was wanted 'professionally;' he was informed that\r\nthey wished to have a deed executed. With great presence of mind, Abijah\r\nconcealed every symptom of growing palpitation, and led the way out of\r\nthe store into the kitchen of his house near by, where Mrs. Witherpee\r\nwas busy ironing, and several little Witherpees at 'sixes and sevens'\r\nabout the floor.\r\n\r\nLike all justices, he thought it of prime importance to be assured that\r\nthe instrument had been drawn up in proper shape, though he consumed\r\nabout five times the time ordinarily devoted to such preliminaries. His\r\nprotracted scrutiny would have alarmed the parties in waiting, less\r\ngifted as they were in the mysteries of legal lore, had it not been for\r\na generous approval that he gave at intervals, of 'Wells' and 'Ahems',\r\nin a tone that was intended to let them know he was doing them a special\r\nfavor to think so well of what they had submitted.\r\n\r\n'Well, my friends,' he remarked, laying down the sacred document, 'it\r\nseems that at this stage of proceedings, the statute requires that--'\r\nand then a pause which was solemn enough.\r\n\r\n''Squire, hadn't I ought to sign that 'ar now?' timidly suggested one of\r\nthe party. The 'Squire was taking a hasty run over the pages of the\r\n'Town Justice' for instruction in such emergencies, but finding none, he\r\nkept on at a venture, and replied with native dignity: 'I decide you'd\r\nought to.'\r\n\r\nWhile the 'grantor' was 'putting his hand and seal' to the deed, in the\r\nlargest-sized penmanship that can conveniently be displayed on half a\r\nfoot of paper with all the advantages of a slant up hill, the magistrate\r\nhad arrived at the place desired, and was now 'in his element.' Kindly,\r\nand yet with no lack of firmness, he is said to have turned to Mrs.\r\nWitherpee and observed:\r\n\r\n'Wife, I think you'd better go into the next room and take the children\r\nwith you!'\r\n\r\nAfter this fraction of the family had been removed to a place of safety,\r\nthe prudent husband and father continued:\r\n\r\n'Hold up your hands! You severally and solemnly swear that this is all\r\nright, true, and legal, according to the provisions of the Constitution\r\nof the United States, and the laws and regulations of the State of----.\r\nSo help you God, gentlemen, and me, Abijah Witherpee, Justice of the\r\nPeace, fee two shillings.' There is reason to believe that both parties\r\nexperienced a sense of relief when the crisis was over, and the\r\nrequirements of the law had been satisfied.\r\n\r\nRich and varied as Abijah's legal experiences may have been, it was not\r\non their account that he has been introduced, but rather for the\r\ncontemplation of his 'fine points' as a citizen. He was never classed\r\namong those men who exaggerate to the assessors the value of their\r\nworldly possessions; in fact, it was always difficult to discover where\r\n'what little money he had' _was_ invested. There was one piece of\r\nproperty, however, of which he not only acknowledged himself the owner,\r\nbut publicly declared he never would dispose of, a threat that seemed\r\nharmless enough, there not being the slightest possibility that any one\r\nelse would be willing to hold such a miserable waste on any pretext\r\nwhatever:--a half acre down by the railroad, slabsided, full of gnarled\r\nstumps and brake, and about equally distributed into rock, black mud,\r\nand water. Had the original trees been standing, it must have approached\r\nquite as near the correct type of the 'howling wilderness,' the _horrida\r\ninculta_, as could be exhibited this side of 'Turkey Buzzard's Land,\r\nArkansas.' Few strangers were suffered to pass by the locality in\r\ncompany with any of the East Hampton folk, without having their\r\nattention directed to 'Abijah Witherpee's Retreat;' and the opinion was\r\napt to be freely ventured that at some period of his life, that\r\ngentleman had come into what is popularly termed 'a tight fix.'\r\n\r\nThe place had originally belonged to nobody in particular, and one day\r\nfell into the hands of a Mr. Jones, at a merely nominal price, in\r\nconnection with a large tract through which it was thought the railroad,\r\nthen contemplated, would be likely to run. The railroad changed its\r\nmind, as all railroads do, and Mr. Jones's speculation was not so\r\nprofitable as he had anticipated. It happened that among his friends was\r\na wild, freakish fellow, Charley Davis, who undertook to be on the best\r\nof terms with everybody, and had succeeded admirably, with the exception\r\nof Justice Witherpee, who, he swore, had swindled him outrageously in a\r\nbusiness transaction they had together in getting out lumber. What made\r\nit all the worse, the aggrieved party used to say, was the shameful\r\nmanner in which the 'old reprobate' would publicly boast of it.\r\n\r\n'I say, Jones,' exclaimed the Major (as he was called) one day as he sat\r\nsmoothing off a new ramrod for his fowling piece, 'what would you say to\r\na chance of getting that old stick-in-the-mud, Witherpee, on the hip? I\r\nrather flatter myself that I can do it.'\r\n\r\n'Go ahead, my son,' said Jones, pleasantly, by way of encouragement.\r\n\r\n'You own that infernal piece of swamp down by the railroad crossing,\r\ndon't you? That air's a valuable piece of real estate!'\r\n\r\n'Well, yes. It's never been spoilt by too much cultivation that I know\r\nof.'\r\n\r\n'I reckon I can just get a heap of money for that air; and what's more,\r\nI can have the satisfaction of selling it to a gentleman who can\r\nappreciate it.'\r\n\r\n'It does you credit, Major. That's what I call a genuine love of nature.\r\nIt ain't every man that sees the beauties of a first-class rural retreat\r\nlike that,' and the speaker's countenance was radiant with\r\nbenignity--whether at the high-toned sentiment of his friend, or at the\r\nprospect of getting the better of the 'Squire, it was difficult to\r\ndetermine. He thought it well, however, to add: 'But I'd advise you to\r\nbe mighty careful if you're calc'lating to run a saw on old 'Bijh.\r\nWhat's your programme?'\r\n\r\n'You see this here interesting and valuable collection of gold dust,'\r\nsaid the Major, producing a vial which contained particles of the ore in\r\nunusual abundance, and flourishing it in his hand in a manner intensely\r\ntheatrical. 'Belonging to a friend of mine, he donates it for this\r\noccasion only, so to speak. It will appear, of course, to have been dug\r\nout of a piece of ground belonging to that highly respectable and public\r\nspirited citizen, Mr. G. G. Jones. With a cupidity not at all to be\r\nwondered at, I shall attempt to keep the matter secret and immediately\r\nto make a purchase. I shall apply to Witherpee, as a man of wealth, to\r\nadvance me part of the funds, or get him, rather, to act as my agent in\r\nbuying it, because you, Jones, a friend of mine, would suspect me of\r\nbeing up to something if I should offer to buy it myself. D'ye see the\r\nbait, now? Catch _him_ playing off!'\r\n\r\nAs further conversation was modulated to an undertone, and accompanied\r\nwith a complete signal code of nods and chuckles, it is fair to presume\r\nthat Mr. J. _did_ see the bait--and was sure of a good nibble too.\r\n\r\nNo time was lost before the speculator and his victim had their knees\r\nunder the same table--with a mug of hard cider between them. Mingled\r\nsuspicion and avarice in Abijah's expression argued well for the success\r\nof the scheme. As is often the case, his love of money was only\r\nsurpassed by the credulity with which he gave ear to new plans for\r\nsatisfying it. He was slow to trust Davis, because they had not been the\r\nbest of friends, but the Major played his cards so well that the old\r\nfellow did not waver long:\r\n\r\n'All you will have to do is to hand it right over to me, you know, and\r\ntake your commission money. You see just as well as I do that it\r\nwouldn't do no how for me to undertake it on my own hook.'\r\n\r\nAnd the 'Squire said, 'Yes, certainly,' but couldn't see it distinctly\r\neither, and after they had fixed upon the maximum price, and the 'Squire\r\nhad feasted his eyes once more on the 'real glitter,' and Charley had\r\nexplained for the twenty-first time that the divining rod had\r\ndemonstrated the singular fact that not a bit of ground outside that\r\nparticular lot was worth a red cent to prospect on, and the 'Squire had\r\nonce for all swallowed the whole story, and declared it the most\r\nremarkable thing he ever heard of, he consented to act as agent in the\r\npurchase.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor some unaccountable reason, Abijah Witherpee found Mr. Jones not at\r\nall in the humor for a bargain. The land wasn't worth much, he knew, and\r\nit was very handsome in the 'Squire to offer fifty dollars for it, but\r\nthe fact was that his feelings somehow prompted him to keep it: it was a\r\nsilly idea, perhaps, but he had always thought, ever since he had owned\r\nthe land, that some day it would be worth gold to him.\r\n\r\n'Gracious goodness!' thought Abijah; 'Jones swore that it was a secret\r\nthat only he and the diviner knew. Could this man have felt it out by\r\nanimal magnetism, or anything of that sort?' But his mind was at ease\r\nagain when he was assured by further conversation that the owner was\r\nentirely ignorant of the momentous truth. The 'Squire's offers were\r\ntempting, and, from byplay and bantering, at last amounted to what\r\nappeared a perfectly fabulous sum. The upshot of the matter was that the\r\ncoolheaded Jones got rid of the wretched little lot for $490 cash. The\r\npurchaser was now quite sure that he was the shrewdest fellow in that\r\npart of the country.\r\n\r\nJust as had been anticipated, the agent's next move was to lay claim to\r\nthe auriferous region himself, and refuse to turn it over to the lawful\r\nowner. The Major exhibited a proper degree of anxiety to learn the\r\nresults of the interview, and appeared well enough satisfied with the\r\nprice--high as it was.\r\n\r\nHe was deaf to every proposition of the 'Squire, who was ready almost to\r\ndouble on the purchase money; till at last the latter declared point\r\nblank that he meant to stick to the property himself; that the agreement\r\nwas verbal merely, and he would have ownership in writing, in spite of\r\nwhat Major Davis or anybody else could do. It was in vain that the Major\r\nprotested and threatened prosecution for swindling, and called witnesses\r\nto the transaction. Before sunset, Witherpee was the sole and\r\nindisputable proprietor of the newly discovered El Dorado.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly worth while to state how so extraordinary a financier\r\nsucceeded when he came to actual prospecting. It was currently reported\r\nthat there was 'some pretty tall digging going on down in that swamp\r\nlot.' It required a lengthy series of geological arguments, with\r\npractical illustrations, to convince 'Squire Witherpee that the soil of\r\nEast Hampton was somewhat feeble in the production of the precious\r\nmetals--except, perhaps, in a metaphorical sense.\r\n\r\nWhen he talked of 'taking the law on those rascals,' he found after all\r\nthat the best thing he could do was not to move in the matter at all.\r\nMr. Jones and his friend were no rascals, and took pleasure in\r\ncontributing every cent of the money to the town fund for supporting the\r\npoor. Abijah Witherpee was since known to have acknowledged that though\r\nrather hard, it was no more than he had deserved, and the change that\r\nwas wrought in his dealings gained him from that time no more faithful\r\nfriends than the confederates, Jones and the Major.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: A gradual change is, indeed, observable, but as yet, it is\r\nonly an incipient one.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASON, RYHME, AND RYTHM.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.--THE INFINITE.\r\n\r\n  The Divine Attributes are the base of all true Art.\r\n\r\nNo work of art can be considered truly beautiful unless it recalls or\r\nreproduces, even in its finite form, some of the divine attributes; not\r\nthat the work must treat of them, or consciously suggest them to the\r\nintellect, but that they must enter into the creation of the artist,\r\nthat the immediate and intuitive perception of beauty, always attached\r\nto their manifestation, may appeal to those faculties or instincts which\r\never answer in delight when these attributes are suggested to the human\r\nspirit; for, consciously or unconsciously, the soul yearns for a clearer\r\nview of the beauty of God.\r\n\r\nWhatever good there may be desirable by man, more especially good\r\nbelonging to his moral nature, there will be a corresponding\r\nagreeableness in whatever external object reminds him of such good,\r\nwhether it remind him by arbitrary association, by typical resemblance,\r\nor by awakening intuitions of the divine attributes, which he was\r\ncreated to glorify and to enjoy eternally. Leibnitz says:\r\n\r\n     'The perfections of God are those of our own souls, but He\r\n     possesses them without limit; He is the exhaustless ocean from\r\n     which we have received but a drop; we have some power, some wisdom,\r\n     some love; but God is all power, all wisdom, all love. Order,\r\n     unity, proportion, harmony, enchant us; painting, sculpture, music,\r\n     poetry, charm us in the degree in which, in their appropriate\r\n     spheres, they have succeeded in manifesting fragments of the above:\r\n     but God is all order, all proportion, all unity, all harmony; and\r\n     all beauty visible here is but a dim reflex of the eternal rays.'\r\n\r\nThe fact of our deriving constant pleasure from whatever is a type or\r\nsemblance of the divine attributes, and from nothing enduringly but that\r\nwhich is, is the most ennobling of all that can be said of human nature,\r\nnot only setting a great gulf of specific separation between us and the\r\nbrutes that perish, but it seems a promise of a communion ultimately\r\ndeep, close, and conscious with the Being in whose darkened\r\nmanifestations we here unconsciously and instinctively delight. It is at\r\nleast probable that the higher the order of intelligences, the more of\r\nthe divine image becomes palpable in all around them, and the redeemed\r\nspirits and angels may have perceptions as much more full and rapturous\r\nthan ours, as ours than those of the beasts and creeping things. It may\r\nbe received almost as an axiom that no natural instinct or desire can be\r\nentirely frustrated, and as these desires for the beautiful are so\r\nunfailing that they have not escaped the thinkers of any age, but were\r\nheld divine of old, and even in heathen countries, it must be admitted\r\nthat in these visionary pleasures, lightly as we may now be disposed to\r\nregard them, there are causes of gratitude, grounds of hope, anchors of\r\nfaith, more than in all the manifold material gifts with which God\r\nmercifully crowns the years and hedges the path of men.\r\n\r\nWe turn to Plato to show how clearly such ideas were held by the\r\nthinkers of antiquity:\r\n\r\n     'Eternal beauty, not created, not made; exempt from increase or\r\n     decay; not beautiful in one part and deformed in another, beautiful\r\n     in such a time, such a place, such a relation; not beauty which\r\n     hath any sensible parts or anything corporeal, or which may be\r\n     found comprised in any one thought or science, or residing in any\r\n     creation different from itself, as in an animal, the earth, or the\r\n     heavens;--but absolute beauty, identical and invariable in itself;\r\n     beauty in which, would they please the spirit of men, other things\r\n     must participate, but their creation or destruction brings IT\r\n     neither diminution, increase, nor the slightest change.'\r\n\r\nPlotinus writes in the same spirit:\r\n\r\n     'Let him who has closed his eyes upon mere sensuous beauty, advance\r\n     boldly into the depths of the sanctuary. Let him reverently gaze\r\n     upon the true beauty, the original type of those pale and fleeting\r\n     images to which he may have hitherto applied the holy name of\r\n     beautiful.'\r\n\r\nWe propose to consider reverently and with a humble sense of the limited\r\nsphere from which we must regard the infinite, some of the divine\r\nattributes, which must, in the finite mode, enter into every creation of\r\nartistic excellence. We begin our reflections with the infinite itself.\r\n\r\nInfinite--this word is by no means the expression of a clear idea: it is\r\nmerely the expression of an effort to attain one. It stands for the\r\npossible attempt at an impossible conception. Man needed a term by which\r\nto point out the direction of this effort--the cloud behind which lay,\r\nforever invisible, the object of this attempt. The fact is, that upon\r\nthe enunciation of any one of that class of terms to which 'infinite'\r\nbelongs--the class representing thoughts of thought--he who has a right\r\nto say he thinks at all, feels himself called upon, not to entertain a\r\nconception, but simply to direct his mental vision toward some given\r\npoint, in the intellectual firmament, where lies a nebula never to be\r\nresolved. And yet to this very point, which the intellect cannot define,\r\nare our spirits forever tending. No artistic creation ever fully pleases\r\nunless there is given in it some suggestion of this mystic attribute,\r\nunderlying and permeating all other attributes of Deity. It is the dim\r\nunconscious feeling after this attribute which causes the forever\r\nrecurring dissatisfaction with the finite, which so ruthlessly pursues\r\nus through life. It is the source of that vague but tender longing, that\r\nrestless but dreamy yearning, that haunting melancholy, which\r\ncharacterize human souls created for the enjoyment of the infinite;\r\ndivining and insatiably thirsting for the absolute.\r\n\r\nLet us now attempt to trace some of the various ways in which this\r\nfeeling after the infinite manifests itself. Plato and his school tried\r\nto explain the existence of absolute ideas in the soul by the hypothesis\r\nof its preëxistence to that of the body in the bosom of the Absolute,\r\nthe Infinite, the Eternal; and, consequently, that such ideas are but\r\nreminiscences of a more perfect life. We find the following passage in\r\nan ode of Wordsworth's:\r\n\r\n  'Our birth is but a sleep, and a forgetting:\r\n  The soul that rises with us, our life's star,\r\n    Hath had elsewhere its setting,\r\n        And cometh from afar\r\n      Not in entire forgetfulness,\r\n      And not in utter nakedness,\r\n  But trailing clouds of glory do we come\r\n       From God, who is our home.\r\n\r\n  'Hence, in a season of calm weather,\r\n    Though inland far we be,\r\n  Our souls have sight of that immortal sea\r\n    Which brought us hither,\r\n    Can in a moment travel thither,\r\n  And see the children sport upon the shore,\r\n  And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.'\r\n\r\nIt seems useless here to enter upon the vexed subject of 'innate ideas,'\r\nor to attempt to convince the reader, metaphysically, that the very\r\nnegation contained in the word finite, necessarily suggests its\r\naffirmation in the word infinite. Enough that the idea of the infinite\r\nis certainly found in the mind of man, that he seeks it in the material\r\nworld, in himself, in God. High gifts may have been wrought into the dim\r\nsoul, which are destined to be gradually awakened through the growing\r\nperceptions of the mind. Every spiritual being created by eternal love\r\nmay have had imparted to him a ray from the sun of eternal love, which,\r\nin its due time and place, is to manifest itself in his consciousness.\r\nSuch participation in God as the primary source of all that is to abide\r\neternally with the redeemed, has, in the present state of our vague\r\nconsciousness, been described by men who felt its stirrings in their\r\nsoul as the memory of eternal love. It might more properly be called an\r\nintuition of eternal love; such an instinct as leads the chrysalis to\r\nprepare for the change which it certainly does not understand. Life,\r\nsuch as the beat of the heart, the action of the lungs, is not\r\nmanifested to the consciousness--neither is the source of this\r\nintuition, which, however, gives evidence of itself by an intuitive\r\nfeeling of incessant longing. It reveals its presence constantly;\r\nsometimes in an undefinable feeling of profound desire, satisfied with\r\nno earthly object, yet but vaguely directed to the eternal or divine;\r\nsometimes in a profound and absorbing religiosity. This longing exists\r\nin an inchoate state; it is a love yet to be developed. From this mystic\r\nroot springs much that is intellectually great, even the love of\r\nscientific certainty. Philosophy may, indeed, almost be termed the\r\nscience of longing.\r\n\r\nDeveloping in its normal growth, it gives us our true saints; those who\r\nlive but to love God, and to serve man. But like all human gifts, it may\r\nbe perverted. It is some such perverted apprehension or illusory longing\r\nfor the infinite, which causes a man to surrender himself, heart and\r\nsoul, to the despotic tyranny of some ruling habit, some favorite and\r\nengrossing pursuit. Alas! it often leads the most gifted of our race to\r\ndevote all their energies, thoughts, feelings, to one faulty, fading,\r\nchanging object, vainly pouring that worship upon the creature, which\r\nshould be rendered only to the Creator.\r\n\r\n                     'He that sits above\r\n  In His calm glory, will forgive the love\r\n  His creatures bear each other, even if blent\r\n  With a vain worship, for its close is dim\r\n  Ever with grief, which leads the wrung soul back to Him.'\r\n\r\nThe despair which this feeling sometimes occasions in the perverted soul\r\nof one intent upon feeding it with the gross aliments of the debased\r\nsenses, is, without doubt, a very frequent cause of suicide. It may\r\nlead, in the soul of the infidel or sensualist, to the idolatry of art.\r\nIt is a feeling, and requires direction. When enlightened by revelation\r\nand purified by faith, it manifests itself in the sublime abnegation and\r\nardent love of the faithful follower of Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nThis instinctive longing for the infinite, existing in the soul itself,\r\ncannot be satisfied by any earthly longing, sensual gratification, or\r\nexternal possession. Made 'to glorify God and enjoy Him forever,' man is\r\nruined and eternally miserable if he refuse to fulfil the destiny for\r\nwhich he was created. His misery springs from the root of his greatness;\r\nit is because there is an infinite in him, which, with all his cunning,\r\nhe cannot succeed in burying under the finite. This is a pregnant\r\nsubject; under this strange caption might be written the psychological\r\nhistory of most human despair.\r\n\r\n  'The Fiend that man harries\r\n  Is love of the Best;\r\n  Yawns the pit of the Dragon\r\n  Lit by rays from the Blest.\r\n  The Lethe of nature\r\n  Can't trance him again,\r\n  Whose soul sees the Perfect\r\n  His eyes seek in vain.'\r\n\r\nThus is faith a necessity of the soul, 'the evidence of things not\r\nseen.'\r\n\r\nThe idea of eternity is necessarily evolved from the negation contained\r\nin the limited meaning of the word time. Eternity is the all embracing,\r\ncompletely complete time; eternity, which is infinite not only _a parte\r\nexterna_, that is everpassing yet everlasting, without beginning and\r\nwithout end; but also infinite _a parte interna_--so that in the\r\nendlessly living, thoroughly luminous present, the whole past, also the\r\nwhole future, are equally actual, equally clear, and equally present to\r\nus, as the very present itself. Can we indeed form any other conception\r\nof a state of _perfect_ bliss? Is the idea of a state of entire\r\nhappiness at all compatible with the regret that must be felt for a\r\nblissful past; the consciousness of a flying present; and the fear of an\r\nuncertain future? Yet the idea of time does not seem necessarily\r\nexcluded from a conception of the essence and operations of God. Does\r\nthere in very reality exist such an absolute opposition between time and\r\neternity, that it is quite impossible for them to subsist in any mutual\r\ncontact or relation? Is there no transition from the one to the other\r\nconceivable? Is eternity anything more than time vitally full,\r\nblissfully complete? If eternity is nothing more than the living, full,\r\nessential time, and if our earthly, fettered, and fragmentary time is,\r\nas the great poet says, 'out of joint,' fallen with man's disobedience\r\nto his God into a state of strange disorder--it is easily conceivable\r\nthat the two do not stand apart so as to have no mutual contact. Those\r\nwho have seen a holy death leave a calm and beautiful smile upon the\r\nface of a dying Christian, can scarcely help believing that the\r\nbeginning of a blissful eternity has impressed itself upon the rapt\r\nfeatures, actually breaking through the shackles of time before the\r\nprisoner was emancipated from its fetters. And those brief intervals of\r\nrapture which are sometimes experienced in the midst of earnest and\r\nardent devotion--what are they but eternity thus manifesting itself\r\nthrough time in the soul? Those who have been rescued from the very jaws\r\nof death, frequently tell us that the moment preceding insensibility was\r\ncrowded and filled with vivid recollections of the whole apparently\r\nforgotten past--thus bringing into the soul in the midst of time, a\r\nforetaste and interval of eternity! and those prophetic intimations of\r\nthings yet to be, which frequently break in with startling power upon\r\nthe human spirit, what indeed are they but sudden contacts between our\r\nfettered time, 'so out of joint,' and the fulness of eternity? Men rave\r\nagainst the justice of eternal punishment, as if its duration were not\r\nessentially part of their own immortality! Ah! if the memories of the\r\ndeeds done in the body are essentially undying, were it not well for us\r\nthat the writing traced against us by our own hands should be nailed to\r\nthe cross, obliterated in the blood of the Immaculate Victim? that\r\nmystic blood which has bathed the universe!\r\n\r\nThe innate longing for the infinite, with its accompanying intuitions of\r\nthe eternal love, and the yearnings for that fulness of time when the\r\npast and future shall live with us as really as the present itself, are\r\never vivid within us, and are two of the great vital arteries of all\r\ntrue art. This burning human thirst for the fulness of eternity in\r\nopposition to our fragmentary time manifests itself in our agonizing\r\nefforts to bring back the past, to which sad efforts we have given the\r\nmelancholy name of memory; shows itself in our restless longing for the\r\nfuture, which we call hope; and frequently reveals itself in an insane\r\nseizing upon something in the imperfect and fleeting present, which it\r\ninsists upon worshipping, in regarding as divine. Upon this last phase\r\nis dependent all that excited, exaggerated, but frequently beautiful\r\npassion of language which marks our poems of love. Ah! it is the\r\nmerciful will of the Creator that we should worship only the divine, and\r\nso the human passion ends in sobs and wails of anguish, for the finite\r\nidol can never fill the shrine of the Absolute, the infinite God!\r\n\r\nAs the intuition of eternal love in the past, we find this longing for\r\nthe infinite breathing through poetry in the form of elegy; in sad\r\nrecollections of a faded world of demigods and heroes; and in the\r\nplaints for the loss of man's native home in Paradise, in the faint and\r\ndying echoes of the happy innocence of creation before the first\r\noutbreak of evil, and the consequent misery of nature. Poetry is indeed\r\nso full of haunting, melancholy memories, that it might almost be called\r\nthe 'mind's supersensuous recollection of the eternal.' And what else\r\ncan be said of music? Is it not an art eminently addressed to this\r\nintuition of eternal love, this constant longing for the infinite? Do\r\nnot its giddy flights and dying falls at once arouse this mystic\r\nyearning, seeking, feeling, which may appropriately be termed the\r\npassion of the soul? That music holds some deep relation to the soul not\r\nyet clearly developed, may be inferred, not only from the magic power it\r\nsways over our spirits, but from the fact that the inspired writers\r\npicture it among the joys of heaven. It is now the language of our\r\n'divine despair;' it is yet to be the speech of our eternal beatitude!\r\n\r\n'God is love:' through all the hidden veins of ever-germing life beats\r\nthis divine pulse of universal being. Hope, faith, and charity spring\r\nfrom the revelation and answering intuitions of this blissful love: from\r\nthe hope, faith, and love of men sprang all the really noble works of\r\nart. All this is full of consolation, 'though inward far we be'--even\r\nthe mournful memory of a past of celestial innocence becomes the\r\nharbinger of a divine hope. Let the poet then still sing of the past;\r\nlike the glories of the setting sun flushing down the golden west, it\r\nbut whispers of a more glorious rise in the mythic east. The root of art\r\nsprings from the intuitions of eternal love; its leaves, flowers, and\r\nfruit, are faith, hope, and charity. May the rapt artist ever remember\r\nthat the beauty of this earth was not intended to satisfy the\r\nrequisitions of his longing soul, but to awaken and nourish in it the\r\nlove of eternal beauty!\r\n\r\nA golden thread of glories yet to be, twines through the woof of this\r\nour mortal life, and by tracing its wavy lines of glittering brilliancy,\r\nshining even through the dim symbolism of matter, many secrets of the\r\nlife to come may be divined. The arts may be regarded as significant\r\nhieroglyphics of delights yet to be fulfilled in other spheres of being.\r\nThe living pulse of omnipotence, the heart of God, beats sensibly in the\r\nbeauty of the boundless universe; it is the fountain at which the young\r\nimmortal is to imbibe his first draught for eternity. Not that, as\r\nerroneously held by the Pantheists, nature is God, no more than Raphael\r\nis the pictures he paints; but assuming the existence of a God as the\r\ncreator of the worlds, what else can nature be but a revelation of God\r\nand divine love, a visible and symbolic representation thereof in\r\nmatter; living, because His breath is life?\r\n\r\nThe following remarkable passage on the religious origin and consecutive\r\norder of the arts occurs in De La Mennais' 'Sketch of Philosophy:'\r\n\r\n     'The temple of art is an emanation from that Divine Spirit who\r\n     fills it with Himself. It is the plastic evolution of the idea\r\n     which man has of Him, of His nature, of His ways, as manifested in\r\n     the universe. From its central sanctuary in which He, the unseen,\r\n     dwells, this temple projects, extending itself in space in every\r\n     direction; but by an opposite movement all its parts, closely\r\n     united, converge to the sanctuary, gravitating toward the central\r\n     point where their Head, their essential and primordial Reason,\r\n     dwells; they struggle to penetrate its mystic veil, to mingle with\r\n     it, to have their being in it, in order to accomplish the perfect\r\n     union of variety with unity, of the finite with the infinite.\r\n\r\n     'The art temple struggles to develop itself by a process analogous\r\n     to that of creation. The surface of the earth was first clothed\r\n     with vegetation, from the lowly moss and creeping lichen to the\r\n     lofty cedar, whose solemn branches mingle with the floating clouds.\r\n     When the earth was ready for their habitation, came the animals,\r\n     gifted with higher life, with spontaneous motion, with instinct and\r\n     sensibility. At last came man, endowed with the incomparable\r\n     faculties of love and reason.\r\n\r\n     'The art temple has also its vegetation. Its walls are covered with\r\n     varied plants, which wind along its cornices and wreathe its\r\n     plinths; they blossom round the oriels, brightening or deepening in\r\n     the light; they twine through the nerves of the vaulted arch; like\r\n     the liane of the cedars, they embrace the tall minarets of the\r\n     heaven-seeking spire, mounting into the blue depths of ether; they\r\n     bind the clustering shafts of the columns in heavy sheaves, and\r\n     crown their capitals with flowers and foliage. The stone grows more\r\n     and more animated, puts forth in more luxuriant growth; multitudes\r\n     of new forms spring up in the bosom of this magnificent creation;\r\n     when lo! at length man completes and embodies them all--his own\r\n     noble image stands revealed--the rude, but white and glittering\r\n     stone glows almost into life under the passion of his forming hand.\r\n\r\n     'Sculpture is but an immediate development of architecture,\r\n     proceeding naturally and organically from it. In proof of this, we\r\n     have only to examine it in its first efforts. Forms, unfinished and\r\n     embryonic, at first closely attached to the stone, growing by\r\n     degrees in accordance with their own fixed laws until able to\r\n     detach themselves from the medium through which they were\r\n     originated, after having acquired the conditions necessary for\r\n     their individual life, spring to actual life, to independent life,\r\n     almost as the organized being springs from the womb of its mother.\r\n\r\n     'Sculpture, however, represents but imperfectly the marvellous\r\n     glories of God's creation. It can give but faint ideas of the\r\n     various effects of light and shade, the constantly shifting play of\r\n     colors; it cannot offer that full harmony of beauty which nature is\r\n     ever spreading before us in the complicated scenes of life. To\r\n     satisfy this want, a new art is created! Closely linked with all\r\n     those which have preceded it, its development is but their\r\n     legitimate expansion. The gray and stern arches, the hitherto\r\n     colorless sky of the art temple, now take the azure hue of the\r\n     heavens, while hovering cherubs look down from their cerulean\r\n     depths; the relievos glow, and color defines, as it etherealizes,\r\n     the works of man. Painting, at first absorbed in the plastic arts,\r\n     scarcely begins to show symptoms of life until she is fully born,\r\n     and living in her own distinctive form! As that power which\r\n     develops the almost infinite variety of forms is to the universe,\r\n     so is painting with its ever ready and vivid canvas to the temple\r\n     of art.\r\n\r\n     'Meanwhile the art temple has not remained wrapped in gloomy\r\n     silence; and another series of developments, bearing the same\r\n     relation to sound and hearing as the first did to light and sight,\r\n     have commenced. As beings ascend in the scale of life, the forms\r\n     appealing to sight alone, become less capable of expressing their\r\n     nature. If the universe had been without voice, the highest which\r\n     it contains had been shrouded in the pall of an eternal silence;\r\n     but creation has a voice which is specific in every genus, in every\r\n     species, in every individual. Transport yourself in thought to one\r\n     of the vast solitudes of the New World--listen to the rustling of\r\n     the myriad-leafed forests as they forever murmur on the banks of\r\n     the thousands of nameless and unknown streams which ripple through\r\n     them; to the clash of the impetuous torrents as they rush down the\r\n     precipitous sides of the mountains to glide on from their feet\r\n     through beds of soft moss or sedgy grass; to the booming thunder,\r\n     driving, scattering, and tearing the flying clouds; to the\r\n     intermingling sounds arising from the myriads of creatures which\r\n     are roaring, bellowing, humming, buzzing, hissing, singing, upon\r\n     the bosom of this primeval world--listen! this is the voice of\r\n     nature, indistinct and confused, but majestic, solemn,\r\n     multitudinous, full of mystery and palpitating with vague emotions.\r\n\r\n     'As the art temple symbolizes the creation, is the plastic image of\r\n     it, a voice is also heard from its depths, which rides upon the\r\n     winds, and pierces afar off. The echo of an invisible world, it is\r\n     solemn, mysterious, and multiform, appealing to the inmost\r\n     feelings, rousing the sleeping powers, awakening the internal life\r\n     of the soul, which without it might lie forever benumbed and\r\n     silent. Corresponding to the voice of nature, it, too, is\r\n     specifically marked, is individualized in every medium through\r\n     which it is produced. Developing in unceasing variety, yet ever\r\n     bound in the closest unity, language syllables air into thought,\r\n     love. As soon as man mingles his voice, his speech, with that of\r\n     inferior beings, the whole creation is enlarged, dilates and throbs\r\n     with new and glowing life. A closer tie unites the two worlds--the\r\n     world of phenomena and the world of ideas. Rising from the bosom of\r\n     organic nature, pressing up like a bud closely wrapped in its sheaf\r\n     of clustering and sheltering leaves, destined to indefinite\r\n     development, the human word is born; it is named: Oratory, Poetry,\r\n     Music! The art temple is now complete. Symbol of the universe, it\r\n     represents all that is contained therein under the glittering veil\r\n     of art.'\r\n\r\nIt is strange how, in the middle ages, the temple of art almost grew\r\ninto one with the temple of faith; to this fact may be traced the\r\nelevated and devout character of the _chefs-d'oeuvre_ of those dim\r\ncenturies. Thus the church became a sublime poem, where the glowing\r\nimagination of a tender faith lavished all its glories. That the\r\nChristian church then satisfied the heart with its mystic dogmas and\r\nsymbolic representations, is proved by the fact that the masses did not\r\ncare how obscure and squalid their own hovels might be, provided the\r\ntemple was great and magnificent. It was the temple of simple,\r\nunreasoning, unquestioning faith, but decorated with the highest marvels\r\nof art; it was always thrown open to the people, and in it they passed\r\nnearly half their days. Man brought what he held to be his best to the\r\ntemple in which he came to worship God, and in it was concentrated all\r\nthe world knew of beauty. Its light but ornate steeples seemed to pierce\r\nthe very clouds; its columns rivalled the shafts of the forest; its\r\nbalustrades were exquisitely chiselled; its tapestry inwrought with the\r\nfinest needle work;--all gave evidence that the hand of love had\r\nlingered tenderly over every line in the house dedicated by man to his\r\nMaker. The pictured saints and angels seemed to smile upon the kneeling\r\npeople, while the majestic chants and requiems sounded to them like the\r\nvery voices of the angels, heard from within the 'jasper gates' of the\r\nheavenly city. The white-robed and entoning priests were their joy and\r\npride; they, as well as the cherished artists, were most frequently from\r\ntheir own oppressed ranks. Religion and art were alone then democratic;\r\nalone expounded to them the original equality of man. Thus they looked\r\nupon these temples, which art beautified for faith, as peculiarly their\r\nown, their refuge, their solace, their ark of safety in those times of\r\nwar and trouble. They earnestly and devoutly believed them to be the\r\nsanctuaries of the risen God, in which dwelt his glorified Body. With\r\nthe first rays of the sun flushing with roseate hues the mystic beauty\r\nof the temple, they congregated there to receive, in the glorious unity\r\nof a common humanity, Him whom the heavens cannot contain--the Son of\r\nGod. They did not think, they felt; they could not reason, but they\r\nheard the church. Naive, simple, and trusting souls, with the Virgin to\r\nsmile upon them, and the saints to pray for them.\r\n\r\nIt cannot surely be denied that art is full of indefinite and\r\ninstinctive longing for the infinite.\r\n\r\nPoetry is full of its pining voice. Chateaubriand says:\r\n\r\n     'When we are alone with nature, the feeling of the infinite forces\r\n     itself irresistibly upon us. When the universe with its\r\n     inexhaustible variety opens before us, when we contemplate the\r\n     myriads of stars moving in ever-mystic harmony through the\r\n     limitless immensity of space, when we gaze upon the ocean mingling\r\n     with the sky in the boundless distance of the far horizon, when the\r\n     earth and sea are rocked into profound calm, and creation itself\r\n     seems wrapped in mystic contemplation--an undefinable feeling of\r\n     melancholy seizes upon us, unknown desires awaken in the soul, they\r\n     seem to call us into other countries far beyond the limits of the\r\n     known--must it not then be the vague feeling after, the dim longing\r\n     for, the infinite, which at such moments we feel strangely stirring\r\n     in the calm depths of the divining soul?'\r\n\r\nWe find the same yearning breathing through the following beautiful\r\npoem of Mrs. Osgood's:\r\n\r\n  'As plains the home-sick ocean shell\r\n    Far from its own remembered sea,\r\n  Repeating, like a fairy spell,\r\n    Of love, the charmed melody\r\n  It learned within that whispering wave,\r\n    Whose wondrous and mysterious tone\r\n  Still wildly haunts its winding cave\r\n    Of pearl, with softest music-moan--\r\n\r\n  'So asks my home-sick soul below,\r\n    For something loved, yet undefined;\r\n  So mourns to mingle with the flow\r\n    Of music from the Eternal Mind;\r\n  So murmurs, with its childlike sigh,\r\n    The melody it learned above,\r\n  To which no echo may reply\r\n    Save from thy voice, Eternal Love!'\r\n\r\nIt is to his fervent and fiery expression of this longing for the\r\ninfinite, characterizing, whether pure or perverted, almost the whole of\r\nByron's poetry, breaking out sometimes in imprecations and despair, and\r\nnot to his immorality, that his great popularity is to be attributed.\r\nEven in the midst of the most unhappy scepticism, it was the haunting\r\npassion of his soul. Alas! that this longing for the food of heaven\r\nshould have been fed on husks until the lower rungs of the heaven ladder\r\nbecame so covered with the corruption of matter and fiery sparks of\r\nevil, that it seemed rather meant for the foul feet of demons, than for\r\nthe elastic tread of the redeemed human soul to God! We quote from him\r\nin proof:\r\n\r\n  'Blue rolls the water, blue the sky\r\n  Spreads like an ocean hung on high,\r\n  Bespangled with those isles of light,\r\n  So wildly, spiritually bright;\r\n  Who ever gazed upon them shining\r\n  Nor turned to earth without repining,\r\n  Nor wished for wings to flee away,\r\n  And mix with their eternal ray?'\r\n\r\n          'Oh, thou beautiful\r\n  And unimaginable ether! and\r\n  Ye multiplying masses of increased\r\n  And still increasing lights! what are ye?\r\n      What\r\n  Is this blue wilderness of interminable\r\n  Air, wherein ye roll along as I have seen\r\n  The leaves along the limpid streams of\r\n      Eden?\r\n\r\n  Is your course measured for ye? or do ye\r\n  Sweep on in your unbounded revelry\r\n  Through an aerial universe of endless\r\n  Expansion, at which my soul aches to think--\r\n  Intoxicated with eternity?'\r\n\r\n  'All heaven and earth are still--though not in sleep,\r\n    And breathless, as we grow when feeling most;\r\n  And silent, as we stand in thoughts too deep;--\r\n    All heaven and earth are still: from the high host\r\n    Of stars, to the lulled lake and mountain coast,\r\n  All is concentred in a life intense,\r\n    Where not a beam, nor air, nor leaf is lost,\r\n  But hath a part of being, and a sense\r\n  Of that which is of all Creator and Defence.\r\n\r\n  'Then stirs the _feeling infinite_, so felt\r\n    In solitude, where we are least alone;\r\n  A truth, which through our being then doth melt,\r\n    And purify from self: it is a tone\r\n    The soul and source of music, which makes known\r\n  Eternal harmony, and sheds a charm,\r\n    Like to the fabled Cytherea's zone,\r\n  Binding all things with beauty; 'twould disarm\r\n  The spectre Death, had he substantial power to harm.'\r\n\r\nIn some of the most forcible lines ever penned, Byron has given us the\r\nwhole psychological analysis of the effects of human passion, when, in\r\nits insane perversion, and misdirected thirst for the infinite, it pours\r\nupon the dust that love and worship which is due to God alone. No one\r\nwho has thus sinned, will refuse to acknowledge their force and truth.\r\nFearful in their Medusa-like beauty, they fascinate the heart, only to\r\nturn its warm pulses into ice. They are actually withering in their\r\ndespair. Poor Byron! did he never, never cry with the repentant but\r\nhappy St. Augustin: 'Oh, eternal beauty! too late have I known thee!'\r\n\r\n  'Alas! our young affections run to waste,\r\n    Or water but the desert; whence arise\r\n  But weeds of dark luxuriance, tares of haste,\r\n    Rank at the core, though tempting to the eyes,\r\n    Flowers whose wild odors breathe but agonies,\r\n  And trees whose gums are poison; such the plants\r\n  Which spring beneath her steps, as Passion flies\r\n  O'er the world's wilderness, and vainly pants\r\n  For some _celestial fruit_ forbidden to our wants.\r\n\r\n  'O Love! no habitant of earth thou art--\r\n    An unseen seraph, we believe in thee;\r\n  A faith whose martyrs are the broken heart,\r\n    But never yet hath seen, nor e'er shall see\r\n    The naked eye, thy form, as it should be;\r\n  The mind hath made thee, as it peopled heaven\r\n    Even with its own desiring phantasy,\r\n  And to a thought such shape and image given,\r\n  As haunts the unquenched soul--parched--wearied--wrung and riven.\r\n\r\n  'Of its own beauty is the mind diseased,\r\n    And fevers into false creation:--where,\r\n  Where are the forms the sculptor's soul hath seized?\r\n    In him alone. Can Nature show so fair?\r\n    Where are the charms and virtues which we dare\r\n  Conceive in boyhood and pursue as men,\r\n    The unreached Paradise of our despair,\r\n  Which o'er informs the pencil and the pen,\r\n  And overpowers the page where it would bloom again?\r\n\r\n  'Who loves, raves--'tis youth's frenzy--but the cure\r\n    Is bitterer still; as charm by charm unwinds\r\n  Which robed our idols, and we see too sure\r\n    Nor worth nor beauty dwells from out the mind's\r\n    Ideal shape of such; yet still it binds\r\n  The fatal spell, and still it draws us on,\r\n    Reaping the whirlwind from the oft-sown winds;\r\n  The stubborn heart, its alchemy begun,\r\n  Seems ever near the prize--wealthiest when most undone.\r\n\r\n  'We wither from our youth, we gasp away--\r\n    Sick--sick; unfound the boon--unslaked the thirst,\r\n  Though to the last, in verge of our decay\r\n    Some phantom lures, such as we sought at first--\r\n    But all too late, so are we doubly cursed.\r\n  Love, fame, ambition, avarice--'tis the same,\r\n    Each idle--and all ill--and none the worst--\r\n  For all are meteors with a different name,\r\n  And Death the sable smoke where vanishes the flame.\r\n\r\n  'Few--none--find what they love or could have loved,\r\n    Though accident, blind contact, and the strong\r\n  Necessity of loving, have removed\r\n    Antipathies--but to recur, ere long,\r\n    Envenomed with irrevocable wrong;\r\n  And circumstance, that unspiritual god\r\n    And miscreator, makes and helps along\r\n  Our coming evils with a crutch-like rod,\r\n  Whose touch turns hope to dust--the dust we all have trod.\r\n\r\n  'Our life is a false nature--'tis not in\r\n    The harmony of things,--this hard decree,\r\n  This uneradicable taint of sin,\r\n    This boundless Upas, this all blasting tree.\r\n    Whose root is earth, whose leaves and branches be\r\n  The skies which rain their plagues on men like dew--\r\n    Disease--death--bondage--all the woes we see--\r\n  And worse--the woes we see not--which throb through\r\n  The immedicable soul, with heartaches ever new.'\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n  'What is the worst? Nay, do not ask--\r\n    In pity from the search forbear:\r\n  Smile on--nor venture to unmask\r\n    Man's heart, and view the hell that's there!'\r\n\r\nMerciful God! how men suffer when they fly from Thee. When they refuse\r\nto listen to the sublime voice implanted within, which calls them to\r\nThee, forever reminding them that they were made for things infinite,\r\neternal! O ye men of pleasure, it is the very greatness of your nature\r\nwhich torments you: there is nothing save God capable of filling the\r\nimmeasurable depths of your longing! How different the language of\r\nKlopstock, as already quoted: 'What recompense could I ask? I have\r\ntasted the cup of angels in singing of my Redeemer!'\r\n\r\nOne of the most dangerous, yet most brilliant among the novelists of the\r\npresent day, says:\r\n\r\n     'Properly speaking, love is not a violent aspiration of every\r\n     faculty toward a created being; it is rather a holy thirst of the\r\n     most ethereal part of our being for the unknown. Tormented with\r\n     intuitions of an eternal love, filled with torturing and insatiate\r\n     desires for the infinite, we vainly seek their gratification in the\r\n     dying forms which surround us, and obstinately adorn our perishable\r\n     idols with that immaterial beauty which haunts our dreams. The\r\n     emotions of the senses do not suffice us; in the treasure house of\r\n     the simple joys of nature there is nothing sufficiently exquisite\r\n     to fill our high demands; we would fain grasp heaven, and it is not\r\n     within our reach. Then we seek it in a creature fallible as\r\n     ourselves; we expend upon it all the high energies given us for far\r\n     nobler ends. We refuse to worship God, and kneel before a worm like\r\n     ourselves! But when the veil falls, when we see behind the clouds\r\n     of incense and the halos woven by love, only a miserable and\r\n     imperfect creature--we blush for our delusion, overturn our idol in\r\n     our despair, and trample it rudely under foot. But as we must love,\r\n     and will not give our hearts to God, for whom they were created, we\r\n     seek another idol--and are again deceived! Through this bitter,\r\n     bitter school we are purified and enlightened, until, abandoning\r\n     all hope of finding perfection on earth, we are at last ready to\r\n     offer God that pure, but now broken-hearted worship, which should\r\n     never have been given save to Him alone.'--GEORGE SAND.\r\n\r\nThus is it that 'love's best interpreter is still a sigh.'\r\n\r\nLet him who would in safety delight his soul with mystic intuitions of\r\nthe infinite, turn to that most exquisite of all poems, the Apocalypse,\r\nfor 'blessed is he that readeth and heareth the words of this prophecy,\r\nand keepeth those things which are written in it.' St. Jerome says 'it\r\ncontains as many mysteries as words'--as many truths as mysteries--and\r\nthese truths are all revelations of the infinite. 'Be thou faithful unto\r\ndeath, and I will give thee the crown of life,' says He who can bring\r\nthee into that heavenly city which needeth no temple: 'For the Lord God\r\nAlmighty is the temple thereof, and the Lamb! And the city hath no need\r\nof the sun, nor of the moon to shine in it. For the glory of God hath\r\nenlightened it, and the Lamb is the lamp of it.' There shall we feed\r\nupon the infinite!\r\n\r\nThe pantheistic _feeling_ into which the imaginative mind so readily\r\nfalls, is thus sketched by a poet of our own times:\r\n\r\n     'I seated myself, after sunset, by the water's side; nothing was to\r\n     be heard save the dash of the waves as they broke upon the lonely\r\n     shore; and I gradually fell into that state so well known among\r\n     solitary travellers:--no distinct remembrance of my own separate\r\n     being remained to me: I seemed to be but a part of some great\r\n     whole, to undulate with the lake, to vegetate with the trees, to\r\n     sigh with the winds, to blossom with the flowers.'\r\n\r\nThis feeling of the infinite so pervaded antiquity, that man almost lost\r\nthe consciousness of his own personality in the immensity of the\r\nuniverse, regarding himself but as an element of the absolute unity of\r\nthe world. His imagination fell into profound reverie, he felt himself\r\nbut as an integral part of a universal movement drawing all things to a\r\nsingle centre, confounding all beings with one sole substance. We have\r\nonly to open the Vedas to convince ourselves how deeply this feeling\r\npervaded the early philosophy of the Hindoos. For example:\r\n\r\n     'Brahma is eternal, the only substantial being, revealing himself\r\n     in happiness and joy. The universe is his name, his image; this\r\n     primal existence, containing all in itself, is the only one\r\n     substantially existing. All phenomena have their cause in Brahma:\r\n     he is not subjected to the conditions of time and space. He is\r\n     imperishable; he is the soul of the world; the soul of every\r\n     individual being. The universe is Brahma--it comes from Brahma--it\r\n     subsists in Brahma--Bramah, or the sole self-existing being, is the\r\n     form of all science, the form of systems of worlds, without end\r\n     forever. The universes of stars are one with him; they have no\r\n     being but as they exist in the supremacy of his will. This eternal\r\n     will is the central heart of all that is. It reveals itself in\r\n     creation, in preservation, in destruction, in motion, in rest, in\r\n     space, in time.'\r\n\r\nSuch an absorption of all things in the infinite, with the consequent\r\nloss of personality, individuality, and all moral responsibility, had a\r\nmost depressing effect upon the character of the people who embraced\r\nthis strange system. This is so manifest that it may be plainly read in\r\nthe sombre character of their architectural remains.\r\n\r\n     'In their subterranean, vast, and dim excavations; in the gigantic\r\n     proportions of their colossal architecture, always impressing us\r\n     with sadness and with the nothingness of man; in their long, still,\r\n     damp, dreary cities of sepulchres; in their half-shrouded and\r\n     mummy-like statues, which, in their corpse-like immobility, seem\r\n     struck with eternal death, or in slowly detaching themselves in\r\n     their vast and unfinished forms from primeval and gigantic rocks,\r\n     grow into a kind of dull, embryonic, and stagnant life, far more\r\n     abhorrent than death itself--do we not clearly recognize the idea\r\n     of the infinite absorbing all things into itself, crushing the\r\n     soaring spirit of man under a blind fatalism, robbing him of all\r\n     hope and aim in life, of the dignity of personal effort and moral\r\n     responsibility, presenting as the only aim of all his glowing\r\n     desires, the utter absorption of his own individuality in the bosom\r\n     of the limitless whole--thus reducing the vivid action of his\r\n     varied life to the stillness of the grave, without its repose?'\r\n\r\nIt is a strange fact, which we will view more closely when we treat of\r\nUnity, that the quest for variety which led men into polytheism, or the\r\nfractioning of the Deity into false and wicked gods and goddesses,\r\nnecessarily forced man to the creation of a Fate, to which Jupiter\r\nhimself was subjected, more blind, more crushing, more appalling to the\r\nimagination (because while retaining his entire individuality, man was\r\nyet forced to submit to its irrational and pitiless decrees) than was\r\neven the hopeless fatalism consequent upon the pantheistic absorption of\r\nthe East.\r\n\r\nWhat a step from the vague yet crushing, abstract yet deadening dreaming\r\nof a fearful and misinterpreted infinite; from the cruel rigors of an\r\nunreasoning and implacable fate--to that full revelation that the\r\nInfinite is a _personal_ God, cognizant of the human, gifting it with a\r\nfree will to choose good or evil, and united with it in mercy and love\r\nthrough the mystic life and still more mystic death of the Divine\r\nRedeemer!\r\n\r\nIn sculpture, the thirst for the infinite is manifest in the various\r\nstatues of the gods which it has given us; in painting, an art more\r\nclosely related to Christianity, in the numberless figures of angels and\r\nheads of cherubs, in the countless pictures upon holy subjects with\r\nwhich it has presented us. The marble speaks, the canvas glows with\r\nhuman aspirations toward the infinite.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly a very significant fact, too, that there must be a point\r\nof escape in every picture, a window to let in the light, a glimpse of\r\nthe sky: an idea of _distance_ must in some way be given, or the\r\npainting will oppress us like a prison. No amount of beauty in a nearer\r\nform will make us content to remain with it, so long as we are shut down\r\nto it alone, nor is any form so cold but that we may look upon it with\r\nkindness, so that it rise against the infinite light of hope beyond.\r\nGaze into Vernet's pictures: always sunrises or sunsets, calms or\r\ntempests, nights of moonlight, misty horizons in which it is quite\r\nimpossible to distinguish the limiting lines--the infinite is always\r\nsuggested in them: hence their hold upon the popular imagination.\r\n\r\nIt is really wonderful in how many ways this feeling appeals to us; it\r\nseems to be the background of our whole finite being. Saint Pierre says:\r\n\r\n     'The reason of the pleasure we experience in the sight of an\r\n     immense tree, springs from the feeling of the infinite which is\r\n     excited in us by its pyramidal form. The decrease in the different\r\n     tiers of its branches; the infinitesimal gradations in its shades\r\n     of green, always lighter at the extremity of the tree than in the\r\n     rest of its foliage--give it an elevation apparently without limit.\r\n     We experience the same sensations in the horizontal lines of\r\n     landscapes, where we see row after row of hills unrolling one\r\n     behind the other, until the last appears to melt into the blue of\r\n     the distant heavens. Nature seems to love to produce the same\r\n     effect upon extended plains or rolling prairies through the means\r\n     of the mists and vapors so frequently rising from the bosoms of\r\n     lakes and rivers. Sometimes these mists hang like curtains along\r\n     the skirts of isolated forests, sometimes they rise like armed\r\n     columns, and move in serried ranks along the beds of rivers;\r\n     sometimes they are gray, gloomy, and motionless, sometimes moving\r\n     with startling rapidity; their sombre hues changing into glowing\r\n     rose, or penetrated and permeated with the glittering and golden\r\n     light of the sun. Under all these shifting aspects they open for us\r\n     perspective after perspective of the infinite into the infinite\r\n     itself.'\r\n\r\nIndeed nature seems never wearied in her varied suggestions of the\r\ninfinite. Ruskin says, Is not the pleasure we receive from the effects\r\nof calm and luminous distance at the hour of sunset and sunrise among\r\nthe most memorable and singular of which we are conscious; and is not\r\nall that is dazzling in color, perfect in form, gladdening in\r\nexpression, of evanescent and shallow appealing when compared with the\r\nstill small voice of the level twilight behind purple hills, or the\r\nscarlet arch of dawn over the dark and troublous edged sea? Almost all\r\npoets and painters have depicted sunrises and sunsets; every heart\r\nresponds--there must then be something in them of a peculiar character,\r\nwhich must be one of the primal and most earnest motives of beauty to\r\nhuman sensation. Do they show us finer characters of form than can be\r\ndeveloped by the broader daylight? Not so--for their power is almost\r\nindependent of the forms they assume or display; it matters little\r\nwhether the bright clouds be simple or manifold, whether the mountain\r\nline be subdued or majestic; the fairer forms of earthly things are by\r\nthem subdued and disguised, the round and muscular growth of the forest\r\ntrunks is sunk into skeleton lines of quiet shade, the purple clefts of\r\nthe hillside are labyrinthed in the darkness, the orbed spring and\r\nwhirling wave of the torrent have given place to a white, ghastly,\r\ninterrupted gleaming. Have they more perfection or fulness of color? Not\r\nso--for their effect is often deeper when their hues are dim than when\r\nthey are blazoned with crimson and pale gold; and assuredly in the blue\r\nof the rainy sky, in the many tints of morning flowers, in the sunlight\r\non summer foliage and field, there are more sources of mere sensuous\r\ncolor-pleasure than in the single streak of the wan and dying light of\r\nsunset. It is not then by nobler form, it is not by positiveness of hue,\r\nit is not by intensity of light, that this strange distant apace\r\npossesses its attractive power. But there is one thing which it has or\r\nsuggests, which no other object of sight suggests in an equal degree,\r\nand that is--infinity. It is of all visible things the least material,\r\nthe least finite, the farthest withdrawn from the earth prison-house,\r\nthe most typical of the nature of God, the most suggestive of the glory\r\nof His dwelling place. For the sky of the night, though we may know it\r\nis boundless, is dark; it is a studded vault, a roof that shuts us in\r\nand down; but the transparent distance of sunrise and sunset has no\r\nlimit; we feel its infinity as we rejoice in its purity of light. That\r\nthis has been deeply felt by artists, is evident in their works.\r\n\r\n             'And can the sun so rise,\r\n  So bright, so rolling back the clouds into\r\n  Vapors more lovely than the unclouded sky,\r\n  With golden pinnacles and snowy mountains,\r\n  And billows purpler than the ocean's, making\r\n  In heaven a glorious mockery of the earth,\r\n  So like, we almost deem it permanent,\r\n  So fleeting, we can scarcely call it aught\r\n  Beyond a vision, 'tis so transiently\r\n  Scattered along the eternal vault; and yet\r\n  It dwells upon the soul, and soothes the soul,\r\n  And blends itself into the soul, until\r\n  Sunset and sunrise form the haunted epoch\r\n  Of sorrow and of love; which they who mark not\r\n  Know not the realm where these twin genii\r\n  (Who chasten and who purify our hearts,\r\n  So that we would not change their sweet rebukes\r\n  For all the boisterous joys that ever shook\r\n  The air with clamor) build the palaces\r\n  Where their fond votaries repose and breathe\r\n  Briefly;--but in that brief cool calm inhale\r\n  Enough of heaven to enable them to bear\r\n  The rest of common, heavy, human hours,\r\n  And dream them through in placid sufferance.'\r\n\r\n                                         BYRON.\r\n\r\nNo work of art in which this expression of infinity is possible, can be\r\nvery elevated without it; and in proportion to its presence it will\r\nexalt and render impressive themes in themselves tame and trivial. If we\r\nwill but think of it, it is very strange in how many unexpected places\r\nwe shall find it lurking: for example, the painter of portraits is\r\nunhappy without his conventional _white_ stroke under the sleeve or\r\nbeside the armchair; the painter of interiors feels like a caged bird\r\nunless he can throw a window open or set a door ajar; the landscapist\r\ndare not lose himself in the forest without a gleam of light under its\r\nfarthest branches, nor ventures out in the rain unless he may somewhere\r\npierce to a better promise in the distance, or cling to some closing gap\r\nof variable blue above--escape from the finite--hope--infinity--by\r\nwhatever conventionalism sought--the _desire_ is the same in all.\r\n\r\nOur ideas of beauty are intuitive, and it is only in a dim way that we\r\nread the types, the powers for whose _immediate_ cognition we lost in\r\nthe fall; but it is certain that a _curve_ of any kind is far more\r\nagreeable to us than a right line; may not the reason of this fact be:\r\nevery curve divides itself infinitely by its changes of direction?\r\n\r\nWhat curvature is to lines, gradation is to shade and color; it is their\r\ninfinity--dividing them into an infinite number of degrees.\r\n\r\nSuch examples might be indefinitely multiplied, but having placed the\r\n_key_ in the hands of the reader, we leave him to unlock the treasure\r\nhouses of suggestive thought, which he will find profusely lying in his\r\ndaily paths. This key will not only open for him many of the rarest\r\ncaskets in which art stores her gems, but will also unclose some of the\r\nineffable wonders of God's mystically tender creation. 'My son, give me\r\nthy heart!' is written in God's own hand on everything He hath made.\r\n\r\n  'To me, the meanest flower that blows can give\r\n  Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.'\r\n\r\nThe absence of that mental vision which unites the visible to the\r\ninvisible is not only ruinous to the art of the present age, but also to\r\nits faith, and, consequently, to its happiness. Thousands, feeling\r\nthemselves in a narrow world while they unceasingly long for the\r\ninfinite, rush into rash and wicked suicide, that they may thus escape\r\nfrom the contradictions and complicated pangs of the finite. The rays of\r\nlight from the everlasting sun of wisdom and love are indeed forever\r\nfalling round us, but we no longer bear the prism of faith which would\r\ndecompose them for us, giving them such direction as they fall upon the\r\nsymbolic, the relative, that we might read in their three-fold splendor\r\nthe symbolized, the Absolute. The human soul was created for the\r\nenjoyment of God, and, consequently, touches the infinite at every\r\npoint, and the health and well being of the spirit are far more\r\nconcerned in its exploration than in any of the vaunted discoveries\r\nwhich it is at present making for the comfort of the body in the\r\nmaterial world.\r\n\r\nAs the limits of the horizon are constantly enlarging before the eyes of\r\none who ascends a mountain, so does the moral world, of which the\r\nphysical is but the symbol, unroll its immense perspectives of light and\r\nlove before the gaze of the rapt seeker of truth.\r\n\r\n  'Deep love lieth under\r\n     These secrets of time;\r\n   They fade in the light of\r\n     Their meaning sublime.'\r\n\r\nThe infinite is the vast background from which all life projects; upon\r\nwhose unity the immense variety of the world is sketched. As understood\r\nor sought by the finite, it is the central fire, the burning heart of\r\nart; it is the _last_ line in all our horizons; the _last_ shade in all\r\nour colors; the _last_ note in all our concerts; the alpha and omega of\r\nall true genius. It aspires in the last sigh of the mortal as he\r\nlingeringly leaves its dim manifestations upon earth: it lightens in the\r\nfirst smile of the immortal as its full fruition greets him in the\r\npresence of his God!\r\n\r\n'I am alpha and omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the\r\nend. To him that thirsteth, I will give of the water of life freely.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. RABOTHEM'S PARTY.\r\n\r\nAN EPISODE FROM FASHIONABLE LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  There dwelleth in sumptuous state and in Gotham\r\n  A merchant of character surnamed Rabothem.\r\n  His wife, once a letterless rustic in Needham,\r\n  Now leadeth the circles of great Upper-Threedom.[12]\r\n\r\n  There's nothing surprising in such a transition;\r\n  For many a creature, of humbler position\r\n  In the scale of creation, can shift its condition.\r\n  For instance, the wriggling, despised pollywog\r\n  In time may become a respectable frog;\r\n  Then, perched on a stump, he may croak his disdain\r\n  At former companions, who never can gain\r\n  His present distinguished, sublime elevation,\r\n  So greatly above their inferior station.\r\n  And so, too, a worm, though the meanest of things,\r\n  Becomes a most beautiful creature with wings,\r\n  That bear it for many a sunshiny hour\r\n  Through redolent meadows, from flower to flower.\r\n  And surely if changes like these may occur,\r\n  Ye men who have reason, how could ye demur\r\n  At change in superior orders of nature?\r\n  And least in a species so sure to create your\r\n  Felicity (if it is not the reverse:\r\n  In such an event she is rather a curse).\r\n  No one, that possesses a spark of the human,\r\n  Would think of opposing the progress of woman;\r\n  But all would be happy when one of her kind\r\n  A sphere more refined and exalted should find--\r\n  Should gracefully 'merge from a chrysalis state,\r\n  To bask in the light of a loftier fate.\r\n  But (those hateful digressions, I heartily loathe 'em)\r\n  I was telling you something of Mrs. Rabothem.\r\n  She's a mouthpiece of Fashion. Whatever she wears,\r\n  The closest and carefullest scrutiny bears;\r\n  And, backed by her husband's munificent pile,\r\n  Whatever she does is accomplished in style.\r\n\r\n  A wonderful party was given one season\r\n  By this excellent dame, for the excellent reason\r\n  That wonderful parties were greatly in vogue,\r\n  And a man was accounted as worse than a rogue\r\n  Whose wife did not follow the prevalent fashion,\r\n  And make what is commonly known as 'a dash' in\r\n  The choicest society found in the city.\r\n  (That the choice is not better is more than a pity.)\r\n\r\n  The writer, who happened to be a relation\r\n  To Mrs. Rabothem, though lower in station,\r\n  Was blest in receiving a kind invitation--\r\n  A delicate note, with a delicate scent on,\r\n  Whose accurate, well-chosen sentences went on,\r\n  In gentlest of terms, to 'solicit the favor,'\r\n  Et cetera, and so on. She couldn't, to save her,\r\n  Have been any more condescending; and so\r\n  I gratefully reached the decision to go.\r\n  And yet my decision was quite a concession,\r\n  As I'll have to explain by another digression,\r\n  In which, at the cost of some time and chirography,\r\n  I'll give you a taste of an autobiography.\r\n\r\n  And in its beginning, 'tis proper to state\r\n  That, somehow, it chanced to be part of my fate\r\n  To be born far remote from the populous town,\r\n  And therefore, perhaps, I've a spice of the clown.\r\n  Be this as it may, I acquired a taste\r\n  For joys which, though simple, are equally chaste.\r\n  In rural employments expended, my years\r\n  Knew not the unnatural pleasures, nor fears,\r\n  Which fall to the fortune of one who is bred\r\n  Where men on unwholesome excitements are fed,\r\n  And horrible vices their poisons distil;\r\n  Where Peace, from her home on the verdure-crowned hill,\r\n  The whispering grove, or the tapestried mead,\r\n  With the bright troop of blessings that follow her lead,\r\n  Comes seldom to gladden the wearisome hours,\r\n  And raise to new vigor the languishing powers,\r\n  But when I arrived at the age of discretion\r\n  (I find I must hasten my rambling digression),\r\n  With the popular error my mind was deluded\r\n  That life is not life from the city excluded;\r\n  So I followed the bent of my new inclination,\r\n  With the liveliest hopes of improving my station.\r\n  'Twas easy deciding, and easy to do it;\r\n  'Tis easy, when thinking it over, to rue it.\r\n  To Gotham the writer with joy was transported,\r\n  Where people in lots, either mixed or assorted,\r\n  Are found in abundance, 'kept always on hand,'\r\n  Of every conceivable texture and brand;\r\n  Exposed at the mart and awaiting their sale,\r\n  Like the cotton that lies in the corpulent bale.\r\n  A thousand of such may be bought in a trice--\r\n  Some dearly, and some at a moderate price.\r\n  I mingled among them; I met them on 'Change,\r\n  And elsewhere, and surely it isn't so strange\r\n  If sometimes, contracting to buy or to sell,\r\n  I _should_ be contracting their habits as well.\r\n  But, though the temptations about me were rife,\r\n  I kept from the perils of 'fash'nable life,'\r\n  So that, at the time when my story begins,\r\n  I never had placed in the list of my sins\r\n  (Though often invited, declining each call)\r\n  The crime of attending a party or ball.\r\n  For, early in life, I was taught to believe\r\n  That pleasures are pitfalls prepared to deceive\r\n  By wily old Satan (who constantly tries\r\n  To catch you by throwing his dust in your eyes,\r\n  Thus, blinding his victim, securing his prize);\r\n  That the dance is a maelstrom, where sinners are whirled\r\n  Around a few times, and then suddenly hurled\r\n  From daylight to darkness, from pleasure to woe,\r\n  From terrestrial regions, to regions--below:\r\n  But now was afforded a fine opportunity\r\n  For taking some pleasure with perfect impunity;--\r\n  Ostensibly pleasing a worthy relation,\r\n  But really seeking a gratification.\r\n\r\n  I went, and, arriving at nine of the clock,\r\n  I found that the guests were _beginning_ to flock.\r\n  I could but conclude--though 'twas early, they said--\r\n  That when folks go to parties they should go--to bed.\r\n\r\n  Ere long the magnificent parlors were thronged\r\n  By radiant beauties and gents, who belonged\r\n  To the circles composed of the lofty _élite_,\r\n  Whose presumption or pride 'twere not easy to beat.\r\n  'Twas a splendid, a gorgeous, a 'glorious' sight\r\n  To be viewed in that parlor on that winter night.\r\n  There were beaux, who the finest of broadcloth were dressed in--\r\n  Invested in vestments they always invest in--\r\n  And belles, who assisted to fill up the scene\r\n  With roods upon roods of their huge crinoline.\r\n  Such flounces! they seemed to my wondering eyes\r\n  Like Alps upon Alps that in majesty rise.\r\n  The costliest jewels and handsomest laces\r\n  Imparted their charms to embellish their graces.\r\n  And the men seemed to float through the mazes of girls,\r\n  Like sharks in an ocean of mermaids and pearls.\r\n\r\n  But soon, as the evening began to advance,\r\n  A movement was made to engage in a dance;\r\n  And, being invited to join in a set,\r\n  With a young demoiselle whom I never had met,\r\n  I took a position to dance with the rest,\r\n  And soon I was doing the thing with a zest.\r\n\r\n  For an hour the divinest sensations were mine;\r\n  But then my enjoyment commenced to decline.\r\n  In halting to rest, I but wearied the more,\r\n  So I finally 'vowed that the dance was a bore.\r\n  Exhausted at length, I collapsed in a chair,\r\n  And studied the various characters there.\r\n  Together they formed a remarkable show;\r\n  For further particulars _vide_ below.\r\n\r\n  There was Trickster, a merchant of physical leanness,\r\n  Distinguished alike for his means and his meanness;\r\n  And Sharper, a lawyer, with manners as courtly,\r\n  And practice as large, as his person was portly.\r\n  There was Aderman Michaels, the head of his faction,\r\n  Who had learned, it was whispered, the rule of subtraction,\r\n  And practised it often in 'grinding his axes,'\r\n  Which helped to account for the rise in the taxes.\r\n  And there was a man with a rubicund nose,\r\n  As bright as the bud of an opening rose,\r\n  Disclosing a liking to 'live and be merry,'\r\n  With a strong fellow feeling for brandy and sherry.\r\n  And then there was one with elongated face,\r\n  Who seemed to have made a mistake in the place.\r\n  Not a jest, nor a pleasure, was known to beguile\r\n  His lugubrious countenance into a smile;\r\n  But he moved through the dance, from beginning to end,\r\n  Like a man on his way to the grave of a friend.\r\n\r\n  Again, there was Simpkins, a clerk and a fop,\r\n  Who sported a very luxuriant crop\r\n  Of whiskers, cut clearly for 'cutting a dash,'\r\n  And flanked by a stylishly twisted mustache,\r\n  Adorning the uppermost part of the gash\r\n  In his meaningless face, like a regular hedge\r\n  Of russety foliage skirting the edge\r\n  Of a cavern, containing a prominent ledge\r\n  Of rocky projections, above and below\r\n  (Though the charge was not 'cast in his teeth,' as I know).\r\n  Arrayed, with intent to astonish the vision,\r\n  In garments whose 'set' was the pink of precision;--\r\n  His chain was of workmanship costly and cunning,\r\n  And the stone on his bosom was really stunning.\r\n  The taste of which no one could doubt his possession,\r\n  Had found in his waistcoat a fitting expression;\r\n  Nor less in his neck tie, 'a neat institution,'\r\n  And collar, which threatened to do execution.\r\n  A marvel, indeed--from the soles of his boots\r\n  To the hair, that was scented and greased to its roots--\r\n  A something for silly young damsels to scan,\r\n  And sighingly say--'What a love of a man!'\r\n  And then there was one sentimental young man,\r\n  Got up on a rather irregular plan\r\n  Of features and form, with a wandering air,\r\n  A collar Byronic, and very long hair.\r\n  'Twas whispered about--'He's a genius and poet;\r\n  And as for myself, I was happy to know it,\r\n  For a package of genuine mental precocity\r\n  Is certainly always a great curiosity,\r\n  And worthy the cost and the toil of a visit--\r\n  Like Barnum's astonishing creature--'What is it?'\r\n  (A good advertisement for Phineas, that is,\r\n  And kind of the author to put it in gratis:\r\n  I hope he'll observe my benign disposition,\r\n  And send for the season a card of admission.)\r\n\r\n  Of course there was that unavoidable myth,\r\n  Who is everywhere known by the _nomen_ of Smith--\r\n  For there never was aught in the way of sensation,\r\n  From a horrible crime to a great celebration,\r\n  But that somehow, before they had time to get through with it\r\n  Mr. Smith has had something or other to do with it.\r\n  Now Smith was a sensible sort of a fellow,\r\n  With a beard that in color was nearest a yellow,\r\n  And a visage denoting his faith in the creed\r\n  That man is a creature intended to feed.\r\n\r\n  Another one still we must certainly mention--\r\n  'Tis Mr. McFudgins, who claims our attention.\r\n  In mould of plebeian he never was cast\r\n  (His caste was of gentlemen, wealthy and 'fast').\r\n  Not noted for morals, nor even sobriety,\r\n  He always had moved in the 'highest society.'\r\n  I had seen him so 'high' as to hiccough and stutter,\r\n  And once I had noticed him low in the gutter;\r\n  Yet he was a 'very respectable' man;\r\n  And into whatever excesses he ran,\r\n  His riches and impudence safely would carry him,\r\n  And plenty of ladies were dying to marry him.\r\n\r\n  The ladies assembled were wondrously fine\r\n  (Young Sentimentality called them 'divine').\r\n  So graceful and pleasing, I could but confess\r\n  Not one of the galaxy wanted address\r\n  (For dress was abundant, nor lacking in taste,\r\n  Though the waist was reduced, there was plenty of waste).\r\n\r\n  My attention was called to a dashing young widow,\r\n  Whose husband, when living, knew not what he _did_ owe;\r\n  For he helped her attempt to keep up with the fashion,\r\n  Which hurried him on to a terrible crash in\r\n  His business, which tended to shorten his life\r\n  And the means that were left to his sorrowing wife.\r\n  She, taken in charge by a wealthy relation,\r\n  Still lived in the style that befitted her station;\r\n  Displaying her charms with astonishing care,\r\n  In hopes of enticing a man to her snare,\r\n  Who, struck by her beauty, might hasten to court her,\r\n  Then marry, and afterward finely support her.\r\n\r\n  Of many, whose fortunes were said to be ample,\r\n  Miss Lily De Lusian may serve as a sample:\r\n  She'd a smatter of French, and a languishing air,\r\n  While of sense she possessed but a limited share.\r\n  She played the piano remarkably well,\r\n  And by all of her friends was considered a belle.\r\n  And perhaps it was so, for she certainly 'told,'\r\n  In the set where she moved, on account of her gold.\r\n\r\n  And then there was old Mr. Spriggins's daughter,\r\n  Who wondered that no one in marriage had sought her\r\n  (A trivial bait would have easily caught her);\r\n  And now she had reached the mysterious age\r\n  When maidens are far less attractive than sage.\r\n  By staying so long, she had come to be staid,\r\n  And appeared to be doomed to be always a maid.\r\n\r\n  The generous hostess was all in her glory--\r\n  A fact it is fair to infer _a priori_--\r\n  The costly apparel in which she paraded\r\n  Was the best to be found in the store where she traded\r\n  (The splendid establishment kept by a peer\r\n  And the ninth of a man, as is ever so clear,\r\n  If you only will notice the names on their palace--\r\n  A fact that is stated with nothing of malice;\r\n  For a Lord and a Taylor no doubt you will find\r\n  A match for two men of the average kind).\r\n\r\n  She moved through the rooms with a beautiful dignity,\r\n  Conversing with all with the greatest benignity;\r\n  Convincing her guests of a flow of geniality,\r\n  As great as the stream of her large hospitality.\r\n  Her dutiful husband was close at her side;\r\n  And, though in his house, it could scarce be denied,\r\n  He wasn't 'at home,' in the splutter and jargon,\r\n  As much as in driving an excellent bargain.\r\n  He suited his wife pretty well, for, at times,\r\n  She found he was useful to furnish 'the dimes.'\r\n  The most of his value she found in his pocket,\r\n  And now he was playing the Stick to the Rocket.\r\n\r\n  But while I was noting the forms and the faces\r\n  Of those who were present--their faults and their graces--\r\n  Reposing my arm on a volume of Tupper,\r\n  I was startled to hear the announcement of 'SUPPER.'\r\n  Rejoiced at the news of a change in the bill,\r\n  I sprang from my seat with an excellent will,\r\n  Presented my arm to a feminine guest,\r\n  And marched to a neighboring room with the rest.\r\n\r\n  O Ceres and Bacchus! would I were but able\r\n  To picture e'en faintly the scene on the table!\r\n  There was every conceivable thing, beyond question,\r\n  That could tickle the palate and ruin digestion.\r\n  Of course there were oysters in various styles,\r\n  And sandwiches ranged in appropriate piles;\r\n  And turkey was present in lavish abundance,\r\n  And of lobster there seemed to be quite a redundance.\r\n  The cakes on the board were amazingly nice--\r\n  The largest encased in their saccharine ice,\r\n  While some, that with nuts or with fruit were embellished,\r\n  Expectant appeared to be tasted and relished.\r\n  The light was reflected in many a gleam\r\n  From mountains of jelly and towers of cream,\r\n  With castles of Russes (I'd scorn to enlarge)\r\n  Which, like Yorktown, were taken without any charge.\r\n  And then there were several baskets of fruit--\r\n  Of such as were held in the highest repute--\r\n  With nuts, that in reckless profusion were stacked,\r\n  And (like most of the jokes) had already been cracked.\r\n  The liquors were all of the costliest brands\r\n  (They had all been obtained at 'respectable stands');\r\n  And as quickly were bottles deprived of champagne,\r\n  As ever were clouds of their treasures of rain.\r\n  Some lauded the Heidsick, while others concurred\r\n  In the settled opinion that 'Mumm' was the word.\r\n  The sires and the matrons, the lads and the lasses,\r\n  Were pledging each other and clicking their glasses;\r\n  And several gentlemen present were fain\r\n  Their goblets of stronger potations to drain:\r\n  On trifles they certainly never could bandy,\r\n  So great was their liking for excellent brandy.\r\n  For those who might happen to be in the throng\r\n  Whose nerves should be weak, or their principles strong,\r\n  A due preparation was graciously made\r\n  In the shape of a bowl of the best lemonade.\r\n  They ate and they drank, and they laughed and they chattered,\r\n  They simpered, and bantered, and lavishly flattered,\r\n  Till, finally, weary of such an employment,\r\n  They left for the scene of their former enjoyment.\r\n\r\n  And now, I had hoped there would be a variety,\r\n  For dancing, I thought, had been done to satiety;\r\n  But, as soon as the party reëntered the room,\r\n  My hopes were consigned to a terrible doom;\r\n  For I saw, to my horror, a body of dancers,\r\n  Who were clearly intent on performing 'The Lancers.'\r\n\r\n  Terpsichore ruled with unlimited sway,\r\n  While, moment by moment, the night wore away.\r\n  To me, 'twas an agony sadly prolonged,\r\n  To stay in that parlor, so heated and thronged,\r\n  And witness the sickening, senseless parade,\r\n  Which people, who claimed to be sensible, made.\r\n  I stood it as long as I could, and as well,\r\n  And struggled my rising emotions to quell,\r\n  But hotter my blood momentarily grew,\r\n  Till objects about me were changing their hue,\r\n  And, just as my brain was beginning to totter,\r\n  I rushed from the room for some air and some water.\r\n  Returning refreshed, my composure resumed,\r\n  I awaited the end, like a criminal doomed.\r\n  With one demoiselle I essayed to converse,\r\n  Whose sense I discovered was not worth a--purse.\r\n  Disgusted with one so insipidly brainless,\r\n  I turned from a task that was tedious and gainless,\r\n  Adapted myself to my strange situation,\r\n  And buried my mind in profound cogitation.\r\n\r\n  O Fashion, thou tyrant! adored as a god,\r\n  By such as obey thy imperious nod--\r\n  How mortals their 'sweet independence' resign,\r\n  When all that is precious they bring to thy shrine!\r\n  Thy altar they grace with the fruit of their lives,\r\n  Themselves and their fortunes, till nothing survives\r\n  To prove to the world that they ever were free;--\r\n  Their souls and their bodies they offer to thee.\r\n  And thou! how unworthy thou art of their trust!\r\n  Thou givest them nought but a damnable lust\r\n  Of silly, deceitful, contemptible show--\r\n  A lust that is stronger as older they grow.\r\n  For this they surrender their faith and their truth,\r\n  The artless, ingenuous goodness of youth,\r\n  The strength that belongs to maturity's years:\r\n  Exchanging their peace for the paltriest fears,\r\n  Lest something, they happen to do or to say,\r\n  Should not be considered exactly _au fait_;\r\n  Or lest their attempts should be wholly surpassed\r\n  By others who claim to belong to their _caste_.\r\n  Thy fiat, O Fashion, their questions decides;\r\n  Thy wisdom all needed direction provides\r\n  For spending their time in genteel dissipations,\r\n  For cutting their garments, and--poorer relations.\r\n  Controlled by thy will, they select their society;\r\n  Thou art their instructor in manners and piety.\r\n  And thus they obey the decrees of a power,\r\n  To which, in a servile allegiance, they cower--\r\n  A power that binds them in thraldom, and then\r\n  Makes puppets of women and puppies of men.\r\n\r\n  Reflections like these were absorbing my mind,\r\n  As I sat on the sofa, or partly reclined,\r\n  While promiscuous edibles recently 'bolted,'\r\n  In assiduous dancing were carelessly jolted.\r\n\r\n  The people about me my senses would strike,\r\n  In spite of the facts, as extremely alike;--\r\n  In physical aspect dyspeptic or bilious,\r\n  In manners affected, or quite supercilious,\r\n  In mind, rather flippant--of false education--\r\n  In heart, scarcely worthy of recommendation.\r\n  There was clearly a lack of the highest ability,\r\n  With a splendid array of the 'purest gentility.'\r\n  Of course I was not in condition to judge,\r\n  And some would pronounce an emphatical 'fudge'\r\n  At such an opinion as mine, and would scout it,\r\n  Insisting that I 'could know nothing about it.'\r\n  To which the narrator would humbly submit--\r\n  He has written what seemed to his mind as a fit\r\n  And truthful recountment of all that he saw,\r\n  Without a regard for the general law\r\n  For stuccoing statements, to give them, forsooth,\r\n  A pleasanter face than is worn by the truth.\r\n\r\n  The end came at last. I was glad, I avow;--\r\n  As glad--well, as glad as the reader is now,\r\n  When he knows that I'll shortly be making my bow.\r\n  The company left, and I marched in the van,\r\n  A wiser, though hardly a happier, man.\r\n\r\n  Of course there are 'morals' attached to my poem,\r\n  Though it may be a difficult matter to show 'em.\r\n  Well, first (let me see, now), the foolishest passion\r\n  Of mortals is that for obeying the fashion.\r\n  It has been, and now is, a curse to humanity,\r\n  A sinful, ridiculous species of vanity,\r\n  The very quintessence of perfect inanity,\r\n  And is likely to lead to a 'moral insanity.'\r\n\r\n  A second we'll have, and I think that will do--\r\n  (You will probably not recollect more than two):\r\n  If you have any taste for the honest and hearty,\r\n  Don't go to a GRAND METROPOLITAN PARTY.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: See account of the 'Prince's Ball,' given in New York,\r\nsome time during the last century.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARY OF FRANCES KRASINSKA;\r\n\r\nOR, LIFE IN POLAND DURING THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nThe following work is from the pen of Clementina Tauska, probably the\r\nmost celebrated among the female writers of Poland. Her talents and\r\njudgment were so highly appreciated by her native country, that she was\r\nappointed to the superintendence of all the Polish schools for young\r\nladies, as also to that of the large establishment at Warsaw devoted to\r\nthe education of governesses.\r\n\r\nThe Diary of Frances Krasinska paints in the most lively manner the\r\nusages, manners, and customs of Poland during the eighteenth century,\r\nand possesses the charm of childlike _naiveté_, united to acute\r\nobservation and deep feeling. The authoress has seized upon all that is\r\npeculiar and picturesque surrounding the heroine, and has laid bare\r\nbefore us a woman's heart in all its strength and weakness, its love and\r\nambition, its joys and sorrows.\r\n\r\nFrances Krasinska, the daughter of a noble house, was allied in various\r\nways during her life to many distinguished personages, whose names fill\r\na considerable space in the contemporaneous annals of Poland. Remarkable\r\nfor her beauty and intellect, she excited a passionate admiration in the\r\nbosom of Charles, duke of Courland, prince royal, and son of the king of\r\nPoland, Augustus III, elector of Saxony. This attachment, with its\r\nconsequences, awakened a lively interest, not only among the Poles, but\r\nalso in the various foreign courts.\r\n\r\nThe castle of Maleszow, where Frances was born, was situated in the\r\nancient palatinate of Sandomir, now that of Cracow. It is said to have\r\nbeen a very splendid mansion, and may still be remembered by a few aged\r\npersons, the actual building being no longer in existence. The journal\r\ncommences at Maleszow, and continues through the most eventful period of\r\nthe heroine's life, principally in and near Warsaw.\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n[We are happy to be able to offer to the readers of THE CONTINENTAL, an\r\nexcellent translation of this characteristic work, especially noteworthy\r\nat the present time, when Poland is once more engaged in a struggle for\r\nindependence, and occupies so important a position in the political\r\nadjustment of the civilized world.--EDS. CONTINENTAL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARY\r\n\r\nCASTLE OF MALESZOW, Monday, _January 1st, 1759_.\r\n\r\nLast Christmas day, only a week ago, my father commanded a large volume\r\nto be brought him, in which he inscribed with his own hand various\r\npublic and private acts; the book is a medley of speeches, public\r\ndocuments, letters, poetry, bonmots, etc., all arranged in order\r\naccording to their dates. This custom prevails among nearly all the\r\nPolish nobility. My father showed us these records, and even read some\r\nof them aloud to us. I can write quite well in both French and Polish,\r\nand as I am not at all averse to the use of my pen, I think I might keep\r\na journal; I have been told that many of the women in France do so, and\r\nwhy should I not follow their example?\r\n\r\nI have bound together quite a large volume of blank sheets, which I will\r\nfill with my thoughts as they arise, with minute accounts of all that\r\nconcerns me or my family, without omitting public matters. My father, a\r\ngrave and serious man, regards little else than the latter; but I, a\r\nvery ignorant young girl, may be permitted to follow the dictates of my\r\nfancy, and the capricious guidance of my imagination; at least there\r\nshall be neither pretension nor affectation.\r\n\r\nTo-day brings a new year, and is truly an excellent time for commencing\r\nmy journal. In this castle there will be no want of leisure. We have\r\nalready said our morning prayers, and I will finish my spiritual reading\r\nduring vespers. It has just struck ten, and I am dressed for the day,\r\nincluding the arrangement of my hair. I have consequently two spare\r\nhours before dinner. I will note down to-day my reflections upon myself:\r\nI will speak of my family, of our house, of the republic, and will in\r\nfuture detail all that may happen to any or all of us.\r\n\r\nI was born in 1743, and am consequently sixteen years old; I received at\r\nmy baptism the name of Frances. I am quite tall; I have often been told\r\nthat I am handsome, and in truth my mirror reveals the fact that I am by\r\nno means ill looking. My mother says, however, that 'one must give\r\nthanks to God for such a gift, and beware of pride; for it is His\r\ngoodness, and not our merit.' My eyes and hair are black, my complexion\r\nfair and well colored; but still I am not satisfied: I would like to be\r\nmuch taller. It is true that my figure is slight and well formed, but I\r\nhave seen women of a loftier stature than myself, and I must envy them a\r\nlittle, as all tell me I have attained my full height.\r\n\r\nI belong to a very noble and ancient family, the Corvini Krasinski. God\r\ngrant that I may never sully so glorious a name by any unworthy action;\r\nmy desire is to render it still more illustrious, and I am sometimes\r\nsorry that I am not a man, for I should then have been capable of\r\nperforming great and brilliant deeds.\r\n\r\nMy father and mother are so fully persuaded of the excellence of their\r\norigin, that our neighbors, as well as ourselves, all know the genealogy\r\nof our ancestors by heart. I confess, to my shame, that I am much more\r\nconversant with it than with the succession of our kings.\r\n\r\nBut what will be the final fate of my journal? Will it live or die? Why\r\nshould it not survive through many ages, as so many letters and memoirs\r\nwritten in France have done? Oh, I must pay great attention to my\r\nstudies! What a pity I have not the talent of Madame de Sevigné, or of\r\nMadame de Motteville! Perhaps I could write my journal better in French\r\n... But no--that would be unworthy of a Polish girl; a native of Poland,\r\nI must write in my national tongue. It is true that French is generally\r\nused among all our nobility, but then that is a fashion, which, like\r\nall other fashions, may soon pass away, and I should not like to leave\r\nsuch a blot upon my memory.\r\n\r\nIf these pages should escape the rats and the rage for curl papers, and\r\nfall into the hands of any one willing to read them through, I hope the\r\nreader will pardon my ignorance, and kindly remember that I write\r\nwithout method, and am totally uninstructed in all the rules prescribed\r\nfor the keeping of a journal. I am but just sixteen, and the great\r\nlittle matters now occupying so much of my attention, may in the future\r\nseem futile and unworthy of having excited so much interest. What will a\r\nsensible, sober-minded reader think of all the strange fancies passing\r\nthrough my brain, and the wild dreams of my imagination? But let us now\r\nreturn to the genealogy of my family.\r\n\r\n[Here follows the chronological enumeration of the Krasinski family,\r\nwhich we omit, as its interest is purely local, and can hence be neither\r\namusing nor instructive to readers not of Polish origin. The Diary thus\r\ncontinues:]\r\n\r\nStanislaus Krasinski, starost of Nowemiasto, of Prasnysz, and of Uyscié,\r\nis my father; and Angelica Humiecka, daughter of the celebrated palatine\r\nof Podolia, my mother: but this branch of the Krasinskis will be extinct\r\nat their death, for to my great sorrow I have no brother. We are four,\r\nand all girls, Barbara, myself, Sophia, and Mary. The members of our\r\nlittle court often tell me I am the prettiest, but that I do not\r\nbelieve. We have received the education befitting our position as young\r\nand noble ladies, in short, as starostines.\r\n\r\nWe are all well grown, and have been taught to hold ourselves as\r\nstraight as reeds; we are in excellent health, fair, fresh, and rosy. We\r\nhave a governess, who is charged with the care of us; we call her\r\nmadame; and when she has laced us, our waists might be spanned, as the\r\nsaying is, between one's four fingers.\r\n\r\nMadame has taught us to courtesy easily and gracefully, and to behave\r\nourselves properly in the saloon; we seat ourselves on the edge of our\r\nchairs, with our eyes fixed upon the ground, and our arms modestly\r\ncrossed.\r\n\r\nEvery one believes that we are quite ignorant, and cannot count beyond\r\nthree; they fancy, too, that we do not know how to walk, and are always\r\nas quiet as mummies. What would they say could they see us running and\r\njumping in the fine summer mornings? Ah! then we make up for all this\r\ntedious restraint; we are so joyful when our parents permit us to walk\r\nin the woods: then we leave our frizzed hair, stays, and our high-heeled\r\nshoes all behind us, and run about in our morning dresses like crazy\r\ngirls; we climb the mountains, and poor madame, who thinks it her duty\r\nto follow us, soon loses her breath, halts with weary limbs, and can\r\nneither run after us, nor call us back.\r\n\r\nMy two younger sisters and myself have never been far from our own\r\ncastle. Our longest journeys have been a visit to our aunt, the\r\npalatiness Malachowska, who lives at Konskié, and to the village of\r\nPiotrkowicé, which belongs to us.\r\n\r\nWhen my father returned from Italy, he founded a pretty chapel in that\r\nvillage in imitation of the church of Our Lady of Loretto. He has also\r\nfounded another chapel at Lissow, our parish, depending upon Maleszow.\r\nMy knowledge of the world is hence very limited. But my elder sister has\r\nbeen more favored; she has journeyed to the ends of the earth; she has\r\nbeen twice to Opole, visiting an aunt, the princess Lubomirska,\r\npalatiness of Lublin; my father is most tenderly attached to his sister,\r\nand respects her as if she were his mother.\r\n\r\nBarbara passed a year in Warsaw at the seminary of the ladies of the\r\nHoly Sacrament, and she is consequently much more learned than we. She\r\ncan courtesy to perfection, and holds herself so straight that it is a\r\nreal pleasure to see her; her carriage is admirable. I know that my\r\nparents intend placing me at some seminary, and I expect every day to\r\nsee the carriage which is to bear me to Warsaw or Cracow drive up to the\r\ndoor. I shall be sorry to leave the castle, I am so happy here; but my\r\nsister Barbara found her sojourn in the convent very pleasant, and so\r\ndoubtless would I. Meanwhile I must perfect myself in French. It is\r\nindispensable for a lady of quality, and I must also complete my\r\nknowledge of the minuet and of music. I should at least see a great\r\ncity, and have something to remember.\r\n\r\nAs I have never had an opportunity of judging by comparison, it is\r\nimpossible for me to decide whether our castle of Maleszow be really\r\nhandsome or not; I know that it pleases me very much, but many persons\r\nsay it has a melancholy air. It is certainly large and commodious, being\r\nfour stories high, and having four towers. A ditch filled with running\r\nwater surrounds it, which ditch is crossed by a drawbridge. The\r\nneighboring country is mountainous and well wooded.\r\n\r\nMy parents complain that their dwelling is not large enough, but then\r\nour household is so very numerous. I said that our castle had four\r\nfloors, and each floor is thus divided: first a hall, then six rooms,\r\nand four cabinets in the four towers. We do not all live upon the same\r\nfloor; on the first we dine, on the second we play and amuse ourselves\r\nwith the other young ladies belonging to our household, and on the\r\nthird, we have our own apartments. My parents, being no longer young,\r\nfind it irksome to go up and down stairs, but to me it is delightful,\r\nespecially before I have my stays on. I mount the balustrades, begin to\r\nslide, and in a moment reach the bottom, without having touched a single\r\nstep.\r\n\r\nWe always have a great many visitors, and I believe that if the castle\r\nof Maleszow were three times its present size, it would still be\r\ncrowded; even now it is so gay, animated, and lively, that our neighbors\r\ncall it the little Paris. During the winter our guests are still more\r\nnumerous; our cavalry captain does not then think it worth the trouble\r\nto lift the drawbridge: the new arrivals pour in from morning until\r\nnight--visitors are continually coming and going. The orchestra\r\nbelonging to our castle chapel plays unceasingly, and we dance as much\r\nas we can; it is a real pleasure to see us.\r\n\r\nIn summer we have other pastimes; we take long walks, and play various\r\ngames in the vestibule of the castle, which is very lofty, reaching to\r\nthe roof of the house, and lighted from above. It is delightfully cool\r\nduring the warmest days.\r\n\r\nI do not believe there are many mansions in Poland surpassing ours in\r\nmagnificence. Our little court is composed of courtiers (dworzanin) and\r\nof the household suite (platny); in other words, of many persons having\r\nvarious employments in the castle: the first (the courtiers) are the\r\nmost esteemed, because they serve for the honor alone, while the others\r\n(the suite) receive salaries; but as they are all gentlemen, they all\r\nwear a sabre at their sides. Some few, however, are of very low\r\nextraction, but my father says that 'a noble on his own territory (and\r\nremember that this territory sometimes consists of but a very few square\r\nfeet) is the equal of a palatine.'\r\n\r\nNo one objects to this, however, as the suites of the great lords are\r\nthus nobly augmented, and they can control so many additional votes in\r\nthe dietines; a circumstance of no little importance. The chief duty of\r\nthe courtiers consists in awaiting their lord's appearance in his public\r\napartments, where, suitably attired, they stand ready to serve him and\r\nexecute any orders he may choose to give them; but if the lord have no\r\ncommand for them, they are expected to maintain the conversation as\r\nwittily and agreeably as they can, or to play cards. They must also\r\naccompany him in his walks, rides, drives, and visits, defend him on all\r\ndifficult occasions, always give him their votes at the dietines, and\r\nfinally, entertain him and all who belong to him whenever an opportunity\r\nmay offer.\r\n\r\nOur little Matthias performs this last duty to perfection; he is indeed\r\na singular person! I have been told that all courts had formerly an\r\nattendant of this description, and that they could not do without one.\r\nMatthias is supposed to be stupid and devoid of reason, but he judges of\r\neverything with an accuracy and precision that is truly wonderful; his\r\nbonmots are inimitable. None of the courtiers have so many privileges as\r\nhe has, for he alone may speak the truth without adornment or softening.\r\nThe courtiers call him the fool, but we call him our little Matthias; he\r\ncertainly does not deserve the nickname he has received.\r\n\r\nWe have, besides, six young ladies of noble families, who live in the\r\ncastle, and are under madame's charge. Then there are two dwarfs; one is\r\nat least forty years old, and is about the size of a child of four: he\r\nis dressed in the Turkish fashion. The other is eighteen, and has a\r\ncharming figure: he wears the costume of a Cossack. My father often\r\npermits him to mount upon the dining table during dinner, and he walks\r\namong the plates and dishes as if he were in a garden.\r\n\r\nI think I mentioned that the courtiers had no salaries; nearly all of\r\nthem belong to rich, or at least to independent families. They acquire\r\nfine manners at our court, and their training serves as a passport to\r\nall civil and military employments. They receive food for their horses,\r\nand two florins a week for their grooms. They have also a servant to\r\nwait upon them; this domestic is usually dressed in the Hungarian or\r\nCossack costume. Nothing amuses me more than to watch their faces while\r\nthey stand behind their masters' chairs; their eyes are fixed upon the\r\nplates during the whole of the dinner hour; surely not an unnatural\r\nproceeding, as their sole nourishment consists in what is left upon\r\ntheir masters' plates. Our little Matthias is never tired of ridiculing\r\nthem, and makes us nearly die with laughter.\r\n\r\nThe major part of our household, however, receive salaries, and do not\r\nsit at the table with us, except the chaplain, the physician, and the\r\nsecretary. The steward and butler are on their feet all the time we are\r\ndining; they walk about and watch if the table be properly served; they\r\npour out the wine for the master of the castle and for the visitors. The\r\ncourtiers are served with wine only on Sundays and festival days. The\r\npurveyor, the treasurer, the master of the horse, and the arm offerer\r\n(renkodajny), whose business it is to offer his arm to the master or\r\nmistress of the castle every time either one desires to go out, all dine\r\nat the steward's table. The courtiers who dine at our table certainly\r\nenjoy much honor, but little profit; they are served from the same\r\ndishes as we, but do not eat the same things. The cook arranges the\r\nroast meat in the form of a pyramid; at the top he places the game and\r\nthe poultry, while below are the pork and the beef, the coarse food of\r\nthe courtiers, to whom the dishes are not carried until after we have\r\nbeen served, and thus the end of the table where they sit is called the\r\ngray end.\r\n\r\nWhen the dishes are first served, they are so enormous that one would\r\nthink there must be a large portion for every one; but they disappear so\r\nrapidly that some poor courtiers have scarcely enough to give a flavor\r\nto their bread. There are some who eat in the most incredible fashion,\r\nand who devour all before the others have had a chance to help\r\nthemselves. On ordinary occasions, our dinner consists of four dishes;\r\nbut on Sundays and holidays, when we have visitors, from seven to\r\ntwelve dishes are placed upon the table. The young ladies, our\r\ncompanions, dine with us.\r\n\r\nThe salaried courtiers are very well paid; they receive from three to\r\nfour hundred florins every year; but then my father requires that they\r\nshall be well dressed, especially when there is a reception at the\r\ncastle. He rewards them largely when he is pleased with their services.\r\nIf one among them distinguishes himself by his zeal or his strict\r\nattention to his duties, my father recompenses him on his name day,\r\neither in money or in stuffs taken from his own wardrobe.\r\n\r\nThe salaried dependents are subject to the jurisdiction of the steward,\r\nwho has the right of reprimanding and punishing them. The chamberlains\r\nare also under his command; they are gentlemen, and serve during three\r\nyears. Their term of service begins between the ages of fifteen and\r\ntwenty. When they have been guilty of any fault, the steward awards them\r\nso many lashes with a leathern strap. A carpet is first stretched over\r\nthe floor, for the bare ground is only suitable for servants who are not\r\nnoble, and the culprit is then chastised. The steward is very severe,\r\nand says that were he more lenient, it would be impossible to maintain\r\ndiscipline or pursue a proper and efficient method of education;\r\nseverity being necessary to restrain youth within the bounds of reason.\r\nMy father has told us that there is not a single room in the castle at\r\nMaleszow in which he has not received correction. This is doubtless the\r\ncause of his being so very good now....\r\n\r\nWe have a dozen chamberlains in our service; one of them, Michael\r\nChronowski, will have finished his novitiate on Twelfth day, and the\r\noccasion will be celebrated by certain ceremonies. It is the\r\nchamberlains' duty to be always suitably dressed; they can enter our\r\napartments; they accompany us on foot or on horseback when we ride out,\r\nand are always ready to carry our letters of invitation or our presents,\r\nwhenever we have any to send.\r\n\r\nAs for the other servants in the castle, I cannot even enumerate them; I\r\ndo not know the number of musicians, cooks, guards, Cossacks, and\r\nwaiting men and women. I can only say that five tables are spread every\r\nday, and that two distributors (szafarz) are occupied from morning until\r\nnight in giving out all that is necessary for the kitchen. My mother is\r\noften present at the distribution of the eatables; she carries with her\r\nthe keys of the closets in which are the spices, cordials, and\r\nsweetmeats. Every morning the steward presents the bill of fare to my\r\nparents, who approve or change it as they find it well or ill.\r\n\r\nOur every-day life is regulated as follows: We rise in summer at six\r\no'clock, and in winter at seven. My three sisters and myself sleep in\r\nthe third story, in a large room with madame. Each of us has an iron bed\r\nwith curtains. Barbara, as the eldest, has two pillows and an eiderdown\r\ncoverlet; the rest of us have only one pillow and a woollen counterpane.\r\nAfter having made a hurried toilet, we say our prayers in French, and\r\nthen begin our lessons. Our tutor formerly taught us to read, write, and\r\ncount in Polish, and the chaplain taught us our catechism; but Barbara\r\nand I are now entirely under madame's direction; our two younger\r\nsisters, however, still receive lessons from the tutor.\r\n\r\nAt eight we visit our parents, to wish them good morning, and take our\r\nbreakfast. In winter we eat soup made with beer, and in summer we drink\r\nmilk; on fast days we have a very good panada. After breakfast we all go\r\nand hear mass in the chapel. Our chapel is very pretty. When the service\r\nis ended, the chaplain says the morning prayers aloud in Latin; the\r\nwhole court repeat them; but to tell the truth, I have as yet neglected\r\nto ask the meaning of them, and some day I must do it.\r\n\r\nWe then return to our apartment and recommence our studies. Madame makes\r\nus write, under her dictation, lines from Malherbe, the French poet.\r\n\r\nWe have a pianoforte, and a German, who directs our orchestra, gives us\r\nlessons; he receives three hundred florins every year. Barbara plays\r\nquite well. After the music lesson, the hair dresser comes to arrange\r\nour hair; he always begins with the eldest. When he has unfortunately\r\nheard of some new fashion, we rarely escape without shedding some blood.\r\nMy hair is longer and thicker than that of my sisters, and when I sit on\r\nthe stool it sweeps the floor; the barber consequently tries all his\r\nexperiments upon my head. The present fashion pleases me exceedingly: it\r\nis a kind of very elegant _negligé_, one portion of the hair is gathered\r\nupon the top of the head and falls down in rich curls; the rest is in\r\nplaits, which hang about the neck and over the shoulders. The barber\r\nuses a half pound of powder every time he dresses my hair.\r\n\r\nWe employ two hours in making our toilette; but in order that the time\r\nmay not be entirely lost, we learn French proverbs by rote, or madame\r\nreads aloud a new work, which is very moral and quite amusing: 'The\r\nChild's Magazine,' by Madame de Beaumont. I cannot express how charming\r\nI find these tales, narrated by a governess to her pupils. At noon the\r\nAngelus is rung, and we go down to dinner, which usually lasts about two\r\nhours; then, the weather permitting, we take a walk. When we return, we\r\nemploy ourselves with our needle, and are now engaged on a piece of\r\nembroidery for the church at Piotrowicé. When the daylight fails us, wax\r\ntapers are lighted, and our work is pursued without intermission. We sup\r\nat seven in all seasons, and after supper we have leisure to do as we\r\nplease. We converse or play cards. Our little Matthias makes such\r\ncomical faces when he fails in getting the card he wishes! He certainly\r\nhas the gift of always making me laugh.\r\n\r\nThe chamberlain is sent to Warsaw once every week, and brings the\r\nletters and papers; the chaplain reads them aloud to us, and to certain\r\nnews I pay the most particular attention. My father often reads to us\r\nout of the old chronicles, but I must confess I am much more entertained\r\nby the books written in French. Madame, who does not know a word of\r\nPolish, always reads to us in French, and we thus become accustomed to\r\nthe sound of the language. My father only reads to us one evening in the\r\nweek. When the carnival comes, farewell to all reading; all then think\r\nof nothing but of playing, dancing, and amusement. The festivals in\r\nWarsaw must be much more splendid than those at our castle. Oh! how I\r\nlong to see the magnificent array of a great court!...\r\n\r\nBut I hear the midday bell, and must say my Angelus, smooth my hair, and\r\ngo down to dinner. I will write to-morrow all that I had no time to say\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\n  Tuesday, _January 2d_.\r\n\r\nI was too much occupied yesterday with merely private affairs, and now I\r\nmust dilate a little upon public matters. I should be unworthy of the\r\nPolish name, if the interests of our dear country did not occupy my\r\nthoughts in preference to all other subjects. I hear much conversation\r\nupon politics, and I am very attentive to all that is said; since I have\r\ncommenced to write my journal, I find my desire to follow closely the\r\ncourse of events much increased.\r\n\r\nAugustus III, elector of Saxony, reigns at the present time over Poland\r\nand Lithuania. He was crowned by the archbishop of Cracow on the\r\nseventeenth of this month, twenty-five years ago. The party opposed to\r\nhis election wished to raise Stanislaus Leszczynski to the throne, but\r\nAugustus was so powerfully supported that he triumphed over his\r\ncompetitor. The virtuous Leszczynski, possessing neither money nor\r\nsoldiers, was forced to return to his good people in Lorraine, who are\r\nvery happy under his beneficent rule. It is said that the queen, who had\r\nso strongly encouraged the king in the struggles through which he won\r\nhis throne, was truly worthy of being queen of the Poles, for she really\r\nloved them. Mary Josephine always hated intrigue; she was mild,\r\ncharitable, and pious; she was indulgent toward her husband and\r\nchildren, but most severely stern toward herself in all matters of\r\nmorals. She was in truth a model of all feminine virtues. She died in\r\nDresden, about two years ago. She had had fourteen children, eleven of\r\nwhom are still living, seven daughters, and four sons. I remember well\r\nthe sorrow which her death caused the Poles. Funeral services were\r\ncelebrated for her in every church in the kingdom. In our church at\r\nPiotrowicé there was a mass at which all the poor assisted, and they\r\nwept bitter tears while praying for their queen.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the king is of an easy temper, and leaves all to his\r\nminister Bruhl, the minister really ruling both Poland and Saxony. The\r\nlast-mentioned country is at the present moment exposed to great\r\nmiseries. Prussia, which is in fact but a new-born state, makes the\r\nwhole of Europe tremble. A great man rules her fate. The elector of\r\nBrandenburg raised himself to the throne in 1701 by the power of his own\r\nwill. Our republic has not yet recognized his new title as king, and now\r\nthe elector's successor is able to confer crowns upon the heads of other\r\nstates. He resists Austria, Saxony, Muscovy, and by means of forces\r\nraised within his little kingdom, daily extends his possessions. All say\r\nthat his political capacity and knowledge of the military art are\r\nextraordinary; besides which, he is quite learned, a philosopher, and a\r\ngreat character. Many think that Poland should be ruled by a man of the\r\nstamp of Frederic the Great, but as we are not his subjects, and as his\r\npresent position is contrary to our interests, strong fears are\r\nentertained that he may in the future become the cause of our ruin. God\r\ngrant that Prussia, which is really but a fraction of Poland, do not one\r\nday swallow her up!...\r\n\r\nThe men occupied in public affairs scarcely venture to speak above their\r\nbreath when they bewail the critical position of their beloved country.\r\nOne circumstance especially seems to deprive us of all hope for the\r\nfuture, and that is, the apparent gradual extinction of those lofty\r\nvirtues of the olden time which formerly contributed so much to the\r\nglory and prosperity of our country. Selfish interests seem now to have\r\ndestroyed them nearly all; the wants of the common mother are entirely\r\nforgotten, no one thinks now except of his own personal benefit--the\r\ngeneral cause is nothing. The diets assemble and disperse without having\r\naccomplished anything. The voice of Konarski and of his honorable\r\nfriends is heard in vain; they preach in a desert; the vile passions of\r\nthe wicked weigh heavily in the balance of our destinies. However, all\r\nmeans of safety are not yet lost: the throne of Poland is elective; the\r\nreigning monarch is aged; if his successor should be endowed with a\r\ngreat character, if his virtues accord with the elevation of his\r\nstation, he may yet save the republic and restore it to its ancient\r\npreponderance among nations. Our frontiers are still unbroken, and I\r\nplace all my hope in the mercy of God.\r\n\r\nAll good men and true patriots desire a king capable of commanding the\r\nPoles. Several candidates have already been proposed, but the two who\r\nseem to have the fairest prospects of success are Stanislaus\r\nPoniatowski, son of the castellan of Cracow, and Charles, prince royal,\r\nson of the reigning king. Poniatowski's father was the favorite of\r\nCharles XII, and was much beloved by the princess Czartoryska. I cannot\r\ntell though why my heart leans so strongly toward prince Charles.\r\nPoniatowski is a Pole, but the other is said to possess many noble\r\nqualities. I will here add all that I have heard and thought upon the\r\nsubject of these two candidates.\r\n\r\nStanislaus Poniatowski is young and very handsome, affable, and\r\nfascinating; he has travelled much, his manners have all the elegance of\r\nthe French, and he is generally pleasing to women. He loves science and\r\nlearned men; he was more than four years in St. Petersburg in the\r\ncapacity of secretary to the embassy. Some time has elapsed since his\r\nrecall, and he is in high favor at court; hence the probability of his\r\nfuture elevation.\r\n\r\nCharles, the prince royal, is twenty-six years of age; he is the king's\r\nthird son, and is beloved by all who approach him. His figure is said to\r\nbe noble, and his face most pleasing in expression; his manners are\r\nmild, and he is very accessible; he wins all hearts to love him. He has\r\nlived in Poland since his infancy, and hence loves the people, and\r\nspeaks their language wonderfully well. Educated at the court of our\r\nrepublic, he is neither proud nor humble, but maintains a happy medium\r\nwith every one. The king, recognizing all these qualities in his son,\r\nsent him to many foreign courts, beginning with that of St. Petersburg.\r\nRelying upon the aid of Muscovy, he desired that his son should make his\r\nfirst essay in arms under that power; besides which, he had other ends\r\nin view. He hoped that Charles would be made duke of Courland, a duchy\r\ntributary to Poland. In 1737 the czarina Anna appointed the count de\r\nBiren governor of Courland, but some years later he fell into disgrace,\r\nand was sent to Siberia with his family. The dukedom was consequently\r\nvacant during several years.\r\n\r\nOur king, who had the right so to do, conferred the dignity upon his\r\nson, but the sanction of the court of St. Petersburg was required, and\r\nno one could have been more likely to obtain what he desired than the\r\nprince royal himself, for the fascination of his manners had become\r\nproverbial. He accordingly went to St. Petersburg, remaining on his way\r\nsome time at Mittau, the capital of Courland, where he succeeded in\r\nwinning the esteem and affection of the inhabitants of the duchy. The\r\nczarina soon after confirmed the nomination of the prince royal. Her\r\nconsent was formally announced to the king of Poland during the past\r\nyear, at the time of the session of the diet. But according to the fatal\r\ncustom which so often rends our councils, that assemblage was dissolved\r\nby a nuncio from Wolhynia named Podhorski, and the affair in which\r\nCourland was so deeply interested was not discussed.\r\n\r\nIt then became necessary to refer it to the senate, where it occasioned\r\nmany fierce debates. The prince Czartoryski especially endeavored to\r\nembroil the question by maintaining that the king had no right to\r\ndispose of the duchy without the consent of the diet; that Biren could\r\nnot be degraded from the dignity conferred upon him without having been\r\nproperly tried, judged, and condemned; and finally, that the nomination\r\nof the prince royal could only be provisional, or valid during the\r\nlifetime of the czarina. These foolish clamors were rendered powerless\r\nby an imposing majority; one hundred and twenty-eight white balls,\r\nagainst five black ones, decided in favor of Prince Charles. The diploma\r\nhas already been presented to him by the grand chancellor of the crown,\r\nand the ceremony of investiture takes place to-day. The rejoicings in\r\nWarsaw must be truly magnificent, and I am quite sure that all are\r\ndelighted.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the king has grown ten years younger since the happy\r\ntermination of this affair. I cannot judge of the importance of these\r\nevents to the general welfare of the republic, but I am enchanted with\r\nthe good fortune of Prince Charles. I ask myself continually why this\r\nmatter interests me so deeply. The destiny of my country may soon depend\r\nupon the prince, and I believe him called to avert the storm which seems\r\nready to burst upon Poland. I believe that he will give us better laws\r\nand a good government. The dukedom of Courland will serve him as a\r\nstepping stone to the throne. I am truly grieved from the bottom of my\r\nheart that I cannot now be in Warsaw, where I should see such brilliant\r\nfêtes, a splendid court, and Prince Charles. ... But since that is\r\nimpossible, I must content myself with drinking his health to-day at our\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LADIES' LOYAL LEAGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs men led the way in the formation of a Loyal League throughout the\r\ncountry, many women, in view of an association of their sex under that\r\nname, seem to think themselves required to adopt ideas and regulations\r\napproaching as closely as may be to those already existing in the male\r\nLeague. But as, in private life, woman's duties, though equally\r\nimportant, are not identical with those of man, so whenever in a\r\ncommunity there is call for united, and therefore public action on the\r\npart of its females, it is because something is necessary to be done\r\nwhich men by their methods cannot do; consequently, in performing it,\r\nour sex, by striving to merely imitate, without regard to uses, the\r\nmachinery or measures of the other, would but defeat their own objects.\r\nThis can be realized when we reflect on the fact that the public action\r\nof man has always a tendency to be directive of measures political or\r\ngovernmental, while that of woman is more legitimately humanitarian or\r\nsocial.\r\n\r\nThere is a class of thinking women who are very earnest and undoubtedly\r\nconscientious in their misapprehension of the existence of this fact.\r\nAnd so great is the restless tumult of their indignation at their\r\nsupposed wrongs in not exercising direct influence, political and\r\ngovernmental, that they fail, either to perceive their own particular\r\nwork--sufficient in itself to occupy all their faculties--or else they\r\nconfound the sphere of society with the sphere of government, imagine\r\nthey are not responsible for errors existing in the former, because they\r\nhave no immediate control in the latter, and that in political matters\r\nat least, justice requires the direct action of both sexes; whereas,\r\naccording to the natural laws of adaptation of means to ends, the\r\nspecial control of government on the one hand, and of society on the\r\nother, is distinctly divided between them; so that while the existing\r\ngovernment is an organized expression of the manhood of the age that\r\nfounded it, the existing society is a like expression of the womanhood\r\nof the time. Society and government, through the inevitable laws of\r\nsympathy and reaction between things closely connected, influence,\r\nmodify, and constantly change each other. But any special interference\r\non the part of one sex with the direct action of the other in its own\r\nprovince, not only impedes the other, but also argues a neglect of\r\nlegitimate duties, which, it were well to remember, require for their\r\njust performance all the energy, intellect, and moral elevation, each\r\nfor its own sphere, possessed by the respective manhood and womanhood\r\nof the community interested.\r\n\r\nAlthough aware that the various circles of the Ladies' Loyal League,\r\nalready established, entertain ideas which are in some respects, because\r\nof this existing confusion as to duties, political and social,\r\ndissimilar to each other, yet we believe the one grand moral aim, on the\r\npart of the several branches of the organization everywhere, will\r\nfinally be the fostering a healthy, intelligent patriotism, in the\r\n_social and domestic circles_ of our land; and that, through the\r\naggregate influence of a womanhood true to itself and its own work.\r\n\r\nIf this conviction be founded in fact, the best method by which such a\r\npatriotism can be cultivated becomes a topic of lively interest to every\r\nwoman in America who loves her country. Therefore to all such the\r\nfollowing brief consideration of a subject so intrinsically important,\r\nwill not, we trust, seem untimely.\r\n\r\nWe proceed then to respectfully suggest to the ladies of the Loyal\r\nLeague some measures and ideas, which, it is hoped, will prove in their\r\njudgment not unworthy of general adoption, in the various branches of\r\nour association.\r\n\r\nIn enumerating methods whereby it is believed our sex has preëminent\r\ncapacity to cultivate a genuine patriotism in our country, we will, as\r\nfirst in order, mention those easily recognized ones already generally\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nAs members of the Ladies' Loyal League, we can do good service, first,\r\nby cheering, honoring, and aiding in every fit way, and by every\r\nlegitimate means, such men, privates no less than officers, as are our\r\ncountry's brave defenders, or as have been wounded in being such.\r\nSecond, by encouraging new enlistments, and taking pride in seeing the\r\ndear members of our own households go forth to the help of our\r\nimperilled country. Third, by paying special honor to such women in our\r\nmidst, as have sent son or husband or father or any near relative to\r\ncamp life and battle field, in defence of our free institutions. In\r\nordinary times, and in ordinary society, individuals take grade\r\naccording to active intelligence, or the show of wealth, but in times\r\nlike the present--and especially in an association whose awakening\r\nprinciple is patriotism, those persons who have made the greatest\r\nsacrifices for country should rank first. Indeed is it not advisable\r\nthat the League confer honorary distinction on every woman who has given\r\nup such near relatives as son or husband to the dangers of this bloody\r\nwar? So long as the United States is in her present condition, so long\r\nmust we, as patriots, honor our soldiers, encourage enlistments, and pay\r\nour tribute of respectful admiration to those of our own sex whose\r\nbeloved ones have already laid down their lives, or are now offering\r\ntheir lives in our national defence.\r\n\r\nAnother moral aim of our League, as explicitly stated in many of the\r\npledges signed throughout the country, is to frown on all traitors and\r\nall such as we know to be sympathizers with them. We hope no one's\r\ndispleasure, will be aroused by a word here. It is very true, no warmly\r\npatriotic woman can now, in the present hour of peril, cordially\r\nassociate with such persons as offensively intrude their treasonable\r\nsentiments. But let the patriotic woman not go too far--let her not\r\nforget that when human beings give, as it were, a moral sanction to\r\nfeelings of hatred or contempt, they unchain a demon in their breasts.\r\nWe are all oftentimes shocked by anecdotes illustrative of the rancorous\r\nspite, and vulgar, unwomanly malignity, cherished by many Southern\r\nfemales against the Union and its defenders. Now were it not well for\r\nus, on the other side, to take warning, and, for the sake of our own\r\npeace of mind, our own dignity of character, our own Christian virtues,\r\nnot fall into the fallacy of thinking it right to indulge in feelings\r\nand words of hate, even toward the criminally disloyal. This topic is\r\none involving so much of social and personal happiness, we are tempted\r\nto enlarge upon it; but as all our remarks at this time are intended as\r\nmere hints and suggestions, and not as an elaborate discussion, we pass\r\non to another method of fostering a healthy living patriotism--the fifth\r\nand last of those to which we now direct attention, but the one\r\nevidently the most difficult, and yet for final results the most\r\nimportant of all. It is the cultivation, in American women, of a true\r\nunderstanding and appreciation of the principles of our democratic\r\ninstitutions--with a view to their practical social bearing, and\r\nconsequent obligations upon our sex.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, a distinguished English philosopher and historian, lately\r\ndeceased, expressed the fear that our American system of government was\r\nin advance of the culture of democratic ideas among our people.\r\nDoubtless this observation took the shape of a fear because its author\r\nwas cognizant of the truth that when the spirit of a government fails to\r\nbe continually nourished by a sympathetic spirit in the prevailing tone\r\nof society throughout the nation over which it presides, then the\r\ngovernment has small assurance of perpetuity.\r\n\r\nBeing patriots, and having, as women, so much to do with matters social\r\nand educational, would it not be desirable to understand clearly wherein\r\nthe foundation principles of our government differ from that of\r\ndespotisms and monarchies, and to ascertain whether our practical\r\nlife--our society--is in conformity with our own vaunted democracy or\r\nnot?\r\n\r\nNow the principles upon which our republic was founded teach that one\r\nperson has no right to trample on the rights of another--that we can\r\nhave no aristocratic order--that he who labors with head or hand is\r\nintrinsically more honorable than the mere idler and pleasure seeker,\r\nhowever wealthy--that legally neither birth nor riches confer any\r\nspecial privileges. And in all this the spirit of our American\r\ngovernment is in direct opposition to the spirit of monarchical\r\ninstitutions. But how is it with American society, in the moulding and\r\ndirecting of which our sex has so much to do?\r\n\r\nHowever opposed to each other democratic and republican partisans may\r\nfeel, the titles of their parties are terms which imply principles\r\nsynonymous--and alike in harmony with the genius our government. But\r\nexamine society among these parties. Mix with the social circles of our\r\ncapitals, during the meetings of our State Legislatures or sessions of\r\nCongress, when democratic ladies are in the ascendency: make another\r\nvisit when the ladies of republicans are leading society in the same\r\nplaces--and do you not find in the practical life of both parties a lack\r\nof the simplicity and earnestness of real republicanism and democracy?\r\n\r\nYes, to our shame as daughters of a republic, we must admit that we take\r\nmore pride in ostentation than in simplicity; and that our dominant\r\nsocial life and culture are a mere reflection, so far as the freedom of\r\nour government will permit them to be, of social life and culture amid\r\nthe arrogant aristocracies of Europe!\r\n\r\nThe relation of an incident which came under our observation in a\r\nNorthern city may not be considered out of place here, since it is\r\nillustrative of the workings of our anti-democratic social system, and\r\nhow it may even be brought to swallow up practically all sense of the\r\nobligations of patriotism.\r\n\r\nLast winter, a sick soldier, who had been suffering in hospital for many\r\nmonths, was finally discharged as incurable, found by his old widowed\r\nmother, and brought to his relatives, in the city mentioned, to die. As\r\na soldier, so long as he could bear a musket--and when he was too weak\r\nto carry arms, so long as he could carry a cup of water to the wounded\r\nand dying on the bloody field of Corinth--since which exertion he had\r\nbeen himself helpless--so long did he serve his country faithfully and\r\nwell. But when he came home to die, though some half a dozen Union\r\nfamilies knew his condition, only one paid him the least attention and\r\nrespect. It may be supposed this was because his relatives and their\r\nimmediate friends were abundantly able to minister to his wants, so that\r\nany outside proffers would seem but officiousness. On the contrary, his\r\nrelatives were poor, sickly, and, doubtless because of sickness,\r\ninefficient people. However strange, it is nevertheless true, that\r\nmembers from two of these Union families, some of them attendants on the\r\naid society, and all loudly patriotic people, ridiculed the attention of\r\nthe one Union family who did try to cheer the suffering soldier,\r\nexpressing the sentiment that they would scorn to pay him any attention,\r\n'his people were such a mean, low set.' That was the term applied to the\r\nrelatives of the dying hero! and this--not because they failed in\r\npatriotism--not because they were guilty of any immoralities--but\r\nbecause they were burdened, beyond their strength, by poverty and ill\r\nfortune! And this neglect was persisted in till the end. The dying boy\r\nfelt the cruelty of it--if he did not also feel the ingratitude of\r\nit--as may be inferred from the last words he uttered, wherein, after\r\nalluding to the family who did minister to him, he added, with parting\r\nbreath, the melancholy comment: 'I am glad somebody noticed me.'\r\n\r\nThis instance of the pride of class in our country going so far as to\r\ndestroy the impulses of ordinary charity, and to blot out of the\r\nconscience the claims of a suffering soldier upon the personal gratitude\r\nof every patriotic heart that can reach him, is, we do hope and believe,\r\nan extreme case. But being a fact, and one illustrative of the\r\ncontradiction between the principles of our government and the\r\nprinciples that sway our social life, we relate it in order to vividly\r\nimpress the mournful reality of that contradiction, and the consequent\r\nurgent duty of all women who are indeed patriotic, to make earnest\r\nefforts to bring the daily life of our people, in dress, manners, home\r\nsurroundings, and motives of action in family and social circles nearer\r\nto the spirit of true democracy.\r\n\r\nTo do this requires so much of personal culture and denial of selfish,\r\narrogant instincts in ourselves, so much of modification in our training\r\nof our children, so much uprooting on our part of cherished prejudices\r\nin society, that, as before stated, it is a most difficult work. But\r\nhowever difficult, it must be accomplished--and by American women, too,\r\nfor men have no power to lead in such a matter as this: it must be\r\naccomplished, or the hope of the freedom and progress of humanity will\r\nbe crushed, and democracy on earth die, even out of institutions of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe action of a government, if not modified by the differing social life\r\nof its people, is the practical realization of its theory: and social\r\nlife among the people, if not too far restricted by the arbitrary\r\ninterference of government, is also a practical realization of its\r\ncontrolling spirit; consequently, the freer the government the more\r\nplainly are evinced the prevailing principles of those who give the tone\r\nto society; and under our democratic system, women--those who give this\r\ntone to society--are with justice esteemed freer than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBut of what value to the race is this greater freedom, if we employ it\r\nin imitating the spirit and customs that are the result of the impeded\r\nsociety of nations less beneficently governed; rather than in taking\r\nadvantage of our wider opportunities to develop a true womanhood, such\r\nas would cause us to regard man neither as a natural foe nor as a model\r\nfor servile imitation--such as would prompt us to influence man, not by\r\nany direct sharing in the performance of his peculiar work, but by doing\r\nour own so intelligently and beautifully, that it shall sympathize with,\r\nand elevate the spirit of his.\r\n\r\nThe society and government of a nation are two great institutions\r\nequally important, and requiring for their wise development equal mental\r\ncapacity. And in the economy of Providence in regard to the distribution\r\nof responsibility between the sexes, while man has hitherto modified\r\ngovernments, woman, among Christian nations--and possibly among pagan\r\nalso--has always moulded society. We glance back thus to repeat our\r\nleading idea, because we wish to add here, that to the minds of those\r\nwho realize the truth of it, the often vexed question of the comparative\r\nintellectual ability of the sexes is put at rest. For where the imposed\r\nresponsibilities, though differing, are equally great, we may justly\r\ninfer that the Deity has bestowed on the differing sexes, upon whom\r\nthese responsibilities are respectively distributed, equal capacity for\r\nwise performance in its own sphere, and equal power to intellectually\r\ncomprehend the other's sphere. For although not so well fitted to\r\nperform the peculiar duties which belong to the other sex--yet each one,\r\nin order to intelligently perform its own labor, must of necessity\r\nunderstand and sympathize entirely with that of the other.\r\n\r\nWe cannot linger now upon how society and government always act and\r\nreact upon each other--how, in our own particular case, the colonial\r\nmatrons of the country lived democracy, before our forefathers\r\ninstituted it--how, in times of after peace, the introduction of the\r\nleaven of the spirit of European manners and society caused the\r\ndaughters, not having been sufficiently warned and instructed of their\r\ndanger, to fall from the practised faith of their mothers, till to-day\r\nwe read the alarming fact that American society has slid back, little by\r\nlittle, till now, alas, it is nearly in conformity with the moral\r\nbarbarism of aristocratic institutions! In view of this retrograde state\r\nof things, as patriotic women of America, we can do nothing less than\r\nperform the work of our mothers over again. God grant we may do it--and\r\ndo it more effectually than they--inasmuch as we, it is to be hoped,\r\nrealize the necessity of so instructing our daughters, that after\r\ngenerations of women will never, like us, see society lagging behind the\r\ndivine principles of true democracy.\r\n\r\nThe heart of many a patriotic female, throbbing with anguish for her\r\ntorn and bleeding country, who has no husband, struggling on the side of\r\nthe holy cause, at home or in the army, to be sustained by the\r\ninspiration of a loving woman's self-denying patriotism; who has no sons\r\nor brothers to send to the battle field, and to write brave, cheering,\r\nblessed letters to; whose means are so swallowed up by daily necessities\r\nthat she has no money--has not even time to bestow on aid societies and\r\nloyal leagues--the heart of many such, in our land now, bends low in\r\nself-abasement, and groans daily with the thought that she is useless to\r\nher country in its hour of bitter need. Let all such females raise up\r\ntheir drooping heads, cheer up their hearts, and take courage. Neither\r\nGod nor her country requires a woman to act in the face of circumstances\r\nwhich are inexorable. But this work of reforming the spirit and\r\nremodelling the customs of society on a simple democratic basis, is one\r\nin which every woman--no matter what her condition, nor how\r\ncircumstanced--is capable of doing loyal service to country and\r\nhumanity. For if she has the will, she can bring her own life, and that\r\nof those affected by her influence, gradually away from the sphere of\r\nprinciples which are antagonistic to our national institutions.\r\n\r\nLet a controlling majority of our sex throughout the United States thus\r\nact--and were our threatened Government doomed now to be indeed\r\noverturned, the startled world has no cause to despair! For then the\r\nwomen of our land would prove its saviors--for, having recreated society\r\naccording to the principle of democracy, they would, through the laws of\r\nreaction, restore that principle again to American institutions;\r\nrestore--never again to be shaken thence, because upheld by the\r\nintelligent coöperation of woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The Continental, drawing its very life from its desire of upholding,\r\nstrengthening, and sustaining our sacred Union, welcomes the article\r\nfrom 'west of the Mississippi,' the object of which is to encourage,\r\nthrough a common literature, the fraternal relations between East and\r\nWest, and cherish the great bond of national unity by proclaiming\r\nkindred ties.\r\n\r\nWe of the East stretch forth loving hands to our brothers of the West,\r\nand, feeling true and loyal hearts beating through the dim spaces\r\ndividing us, bid them God speed, as bone of our bone, and flesh of our\r\nflesh, whose prosperity is our life, whose ruin would be our own\r\ndesolation.\r\n\r\n  'As from the East the lovely exile goes,\r\n  Fair on the West a young Aurora glows;\r\n  And all the flowers Ionian shores could yield\r\n  Blush forth, reblooming in the Hesperian field.'\r\n\r\n  EDS. CONTINENTAL.]\r\n\r\nFrom our quiet homes, on the western bank of the Mississippi, very\r\nnearly in Boston latitude, we send daily thoughts of business, friendly\r\ninterest, and political sympathy unto you who dwell upon our Atlantic\r\nshore. Some of us look back unto you as the prodigal son is said to have\r\nregarded his father's house. All of us have intimate ties binding us\r\nunto you. From you, as the fountain head of literature and intelligence,\r\nthrough your magazines and journals, we are constantly supplied with the\r\nliving current of thought and mental activity. Is it anything but fair\r\nthat we should occasionally seek to respond and acknowledge the debt and\r\nthe fellowship? For what shall more tend to strengthen the bonds of our\r\nbroad Union than these common sympathies of a widespread and national\r\nfraternity of literary tastes and gratifications? Assimilation of mind,\r\ncommunity of thought produced by free interchange of opinion, in the way\r\nof social intercourse, these will open our hearts to each other and\r\nstrengthen the links of our national brotherhood. That we may love each\r\nother, let us know each other; that we may know each other, let us not\r\nfail to look each other fairly in the face.\r\n\r\nWest of the deep and gently flowing northern Mississippi, I know, is a\r\nlong way off from the surging waters of your eastern coasts. When you\r\nhave come this distance, you are, in so far as distance only is\r\nconcerned, pretty well on your way toward the Rocky Mountains, and the\r\nnew land of El Dorado, the young and golden Nevada. But yet we are in\r\nfact much nearer to your golden markets than to the hidden ore of our\r\nnew Territories. Time and space, whose natural demands have been so\r\nrudely disregarded by the iron progress of science and skill between you\r\nand us, still to a great degree maintain their ancient rule over the\r\nlands west of us. That vast, thrifty vine of speedy transportation,\r\nwhich has wound itself about the trunk of our national tree, strikes\r\nhere and there one of its tendrils out upon the branches beyond us, over\r\nthe region of a few counties. In one instance, in the State immediately\r\nsouth of us, a single energetic scion has crept even to the banks of\r\nthe rapid Missouri, and others are pushing steadily on in determined\r\nemulation. But in most cases, we must be content to ride to the\r\nwestward, only on the back of the laggard and unambitious coach, that\r\ntortoise of travel, crawling on through prairie and swamp. And it is\r\nstill within the recollection of almost the youngest inhabitant, how the\r\ndaily trains, drawn by horse, mule, or ox, dragged themselves through\r\nour streets, proclaiming from their cotton coverings their distant\r\ndestination, illustrating on their march the Western 'Excelsior'--\r\n\r\n  'The wheels in mud were sticking fast,\r\n  As through a boundless prairie passed\r\n  A youth, who drove a two-mule team,\r\n  While on his wagon top was seen.\r\n\r\n  PIKE'S PEAK.'\r\n\r\nThus eastward we are within forty-eight hours of your press, while\r\nwestward we are nearly as many days distant by private conveyance from\r\nthe land of fabled wealth. But time and space must eventually give in.\r\nThey are not equal to the task; and already the shadow of the great\r\nPacific road makes them tremble for their natural tenure of the free\r\nWest. It might have done for Æsop to talk about the tortoise and the\r\nhare, when they had not steam in those days to course their streams and\r\nstalk across their plains with giant tread, eclipsing the old\r\nseven-league boots of their fancy; but the tortoise is a used-up\r\nindividual, is short of breath, and it is the passenger that sleeps,\r\nwhile the hare leaps onward to his covert.\r\n\r\nBeing thus brought near to you by the swift convoys of science, it will\r\nbe evident that we are not so far away as we seem. We do not perpetrate\r\nan Irish bull when we say that the distance _to_ a place is often\r\ngreater than the distance in returning. It is, on the contrary, a well\r\nauthenticated natural fact--a phenomenon, if you please. And by way of\r\nillustration we may aver that it is a great deal farther from your\r\nmetropolis to west of the Mississippi, than from west of the Mississippi\r\nto the metropolis.\r\n\r\nYou sit in your cosy parlors and offices and think of some friend or\r\nrelative, perhaps a son or daughter, in the 'far West.' It seems as if a\r\nsea spread out between you, or at least the better part of a continent.\r\nYou think of India and China, perchance, or of England or France, and\r\nyou feel as if they were all nearly equidistant with the home of your\r\nbeloved ones. It is so far away out to the Father of Waters, and you can\r\nnever make up your mind, without great and frequent resolution, to\r\nundertake such a journey as this.\r\n\r\nBut, my friends, it is not half so far as that, from us to the Atlantic\r\ncoast. It is not so far from us to you, as it is to some tardy customer,\r\nwhose bills are yet to collect, a hundred miles down the country by a\r\ntwo-days' stage adventure. Not nearly so far. Why, when we want to go to\r\nNew York or Boston, we don't pack our trunks and take a cargo of luggage\r\non board for a two-months' voyage. We just tumble hurriedly a few things\r\ninto a valise or carpet sack before we go to bed, and the next morning\r\noff we start, and after two days of sight-seeing and newspaper reading\r\nalong the way, and two nights' comfortable sleeping-car rest, we wake up\r\nat the dawn of the third day to bid you good morning and inquire after\r\nthe markets; and that is the end of it.\r\n\r\nIt isn't so very far, after all. We put off in the morning, bid good\r\nevening to Chicago, good morning to Toledo, a ten-o'clock good night to\r\nBuffalo, and we sit down to a late breakfast with you the following day.\r\n\r\nBut then if you have never been out here, it's a long, long distance,\r\nand we advise you not to try it all of a sudden, nor to come without a\r\ntrunk. _Quod erat demonstrandum._\r\n\r\nThen, in the next place, being out here, what sort of a people are we?\r\nThis is a very important query. In the eyes of many we are Western\r\nsemi-barbarians, without an overplus of manners, means, comforts,\r\nknowledge, or many, if any, of the means of Eastern and refined\r\nenjoyment. We have come hither to make our fortunes, or to care for\r\nthose who have, and we are the fit objects of spiritual and temporal\r\ncommiseration and missionary operations. That is the idea somewhat\r\ncandidly expressed, isn't it? Oh, no! you don't think so poorly of us as\r\nthat; but then we are a great ways off, in fact, in a new country, among\r\nstrangers for the most part, and of course we cannot expect to find\r\neverything at hand which we enjoyed in our former comfortable homes.\r\n\r\nWell, we are, many of us, from the 'far' East, and most of us from\r\neastward. But we have tried to bring whatever of refinement, manners,\r\nknowledge, proprieties, and comforts we before possessed, such as they\r\nwere, with us, and we haven't lost many of them. We do not believe that\r\ncontact with the Indians has very much barbarized us. We still read and\r\nwrite and live in houses which we have built, and conduct mercantile and\r\nother transactions on former equitable principles; and our\r\ncommunications and intercourse with each other may still be said to be\r\ncivilized, at least in great measure. We eat and drink what we formerly\r\ndid, not excepting occasional shad and frequent oysters; and you do not\r\nseem to be averse to trying our deer and grouse once in a while--while\r\nwe even share with you our wheat, cattle, and pork. We don't wear\r\nmoccasons as yet, nor buckskin with Indian trimmings, instead of doeskin\r\nwith the latest cut. We try, for the sake of appearances, to wear cotton\r\nand woollen and silk; and beads and trinkets are in no extraordinary\r\ndemand. Beavers and furs are seen upon our streets; and the sound of the\r\npiano heard in the land, is not a very unusual disturbance. Our boys, as\r\nof old, smoke cigars in secret, fearful of ancient birch, and gum drops\r\nstill adhere to the pockets of our girls in school. We don't see a very\r\nremarkable difference between the children about us and those we knew at\r\na somewhat early age. Brick and stone rise with us into comfortable and\r\neven aspiring buildings, and the price of board is not less than we have\r\npaid before, nor so very much more. We neither travel nor live on half\r\nfare. And men still drive the horse before the cart, and carry the wheat\r\nin both ends of the bag as they go to mill.\r\n\r\nIn fact, we don't see that civilization has lost much flesh in its\r\narduous journey to the far West; nor that, being human before, we have\r\nbecome less human now, or discarded our manners when we shut the doors\r\nof our birthplace behind us. We know indeed that Colenso went to convert\r\nthe heathen, and that the heathen succeeded in converting him, thus\r\nputting the boot on the other leg; but the Indians have not yet won us\r\nto their dusky faith, although we must confess that assimilation to\r\ntheir copper-colored principles seems to have made some Copperheads\r\namong us.\r\n\r\nAs to works of art, they are not very plentiful hereabouts, excepting in\r\nthe way of monuments perhaps. We have a generous number of those,\r\nerected to the large-heartedness and wisdom of persons who engaged in\r\ngreat improvement schemes, in the line of speculation, when there was\r\nbut a fictitious basis of wealth in this land, before the bubble burst.\r\nThese monuments, however, are not generally esteemed ornamental, and the\r\nwealth so lavishly expended upon them came not from the bosom of our\r\ncommunities, neither was it imported from north of us, nor west of us,\r\nbut from whence I will not say. Perhaps some one who reads can help to\r\naccount for part of it. These monuments, however, such as they are,\r\nhave, by the liberal contributions made for their erection, exceeded in\r\ncost that of Bunker Hill, or the half-finished shot tower in Washington.\r\nOur only statues do not represent either the Father of his Country, nor\r\nthe late old public defunctionary who sat in his chair--but they are\r\nprincipally devoted to 'the poor Indian,' in native costume. These\r\nstatues, frequently wooden, exhibit the wonted hospitality of this race,\r\nand maintain the attitude of proffering a cigar to the friendly passer\r\nby.\r\n\r\nOf paintings there is not a superfluity; still we have a small\r\ncollection, comprising several which have for some years been on public\r\nexhibition, illustrating 'The Good Samaritan;' 'Prodigious;'\r\n'Washington's Blacksmith shoeing Washington's Horse,' and others of\r\nless note, while ----'s panorama of the war has lately departed from us.\r\n\r\nStill we have our public and private schools, seminaries, and churches,\r\nas others have in fully civilized countries; our newspapers, white and\r\nbronze; our leading men, and officeholders; natives of all climes and\r\nkindreds, Jew and Gentile, German and French, Bohemian and Scotch,\r\nEnglish and Irish; our generals and our corporals; our learned and our\r\nunlearned; debtors and creditors--comprising mostly all of us; but\r\nbelieve me, friend, not a solitary living Indian.\r\n\r\nI think we are a generous, hospitable, liberal people, up to the full\r\nlimit of our means and capabilities. Being all away from home, as it\r\nwere, and all strangers together, we have learned the blessedness of\r\nsympathy, and how a little lift is often a great boost, and a friend in\r\nneed a friend indeed. It was formerly said that when a stranger\r\nappeared, the inhabitants emulously set to work to take him in, not\r\nhowever in the flattering and hospitable sense of the words. But as\r\nalmost without exception any man in a new place or position is a verdant\r\nman, so we honestly maintain that they took themselves in, and found it\r\nrather difficult to take themselves out again. I believe that we are as\r\nquiet, honest, genteel, and mind-your-own-business a set of folks as you\r\nmay find in most other and more favored communities. With the constant\r\nand increasing accessions to our society from more enlightened regions,\r\nit would be a wonder did we not attain in time to a level with many\r\nother and older-settled countries, who are apt to look abroad with\r\nserene complacency gathering motes in open eyes, We have had our castles\r\nin the air, and some of them are now underground; but we have read of\r\nSouth Sea bubbles, rise and fall in stocks, 'On to Richmonds,'\r\nMcClellans, and Congress; and we don't think the beams are all in our\r\nown eyes and the motes too.\r\n\r\nIn fact we are not heathen nor barbarian, Goth nor Vandal, Hottentot nor\r\nFire Eater--but bone of your bone, flesh of your flesh--one with you in\r\nall the customs, proprieties, civilization, and hopes of the great\r\nAmerican people; bound to save the republic of our fathers, if we go to\r\nthe death in defence of our mutual rights, principles, and homes.\r\n\r\nDo you ask then, 'What is the need of saying all this, since we know it\r\nall?' I reply, there is need of saying it, and of repeating it again.\r\nThere may not be need of it for you, my friend; there is need of it for\r\nmany others. Talk not of making us of one flesh twain. It cannot be. It\r\nis not a question of mere _interest_ that shall bind us as a people\r\ninseparably in one. God will not solder a chain. It is a higher bond, a\r\nholier bond. We are essentially and intrinsically one; one by nature;\r\none by mutual sympathies, by blood relations, by dearest ties; one in\r\nall that constitutes the unity of a family relation; one in heart, one\r\nin aim, one in mind, purpose, education, and will. None can make us two.\r\nLines may be drawn by ambitious schemers, divisions discussed, but these\r\ndo not constitute separation or alienation. The heart of the people\r\nbeats in profound and resolute unison. What God hath joined together let\r\nnot man put asunder.\r\n\r\nRise, then, as thou art already rising, great heart of the troubled\r\nnation, throb from one confine to the other, bid faction's agitation\r\nhush, crush down opposition, scorn the unholy threat, dash the\r\ntraitorous scheme, and declare the resolute and solemn purpose of all\r\nthe members to live and govern together, as parts of the same living\r\nunity, till the whole body politic becomes a prostrate, lifeless corpse.\r\nAnd from the western border of the States, even from among the youngest\r\nand least of the children of the Union of Seventy-six, the union of\r\noaths and the union of hearts, the union of instincts and the union of\r\nhopes, do we, in the name of her daughters and sons, bid you, upon the\r\neastern confines, and the States between, you the mothers, and you the\r\nelder daughters, all hail, and God speed you in the work of forging\r\nanew, even in the fierce fires, the links that bind us into one; 'so\r\nmaking peace.'\r\n\r\nFor we are of you and with you, and will be ever, while our setting sun\r\nis your rising sun--ever, until we become two distinct and divergent\r\nraces--till you cease to be Joseph and we cease to be Benjamin--till you\r\nbecome Edom and we become Moab--till long centuries shall have erased\r\nall kindred ties and bonds of consanguinity, and all men, forgetful of\r\nhistory, shall sink together into vassalage and ancient barbarism. But\r\nuntil then we are one in heart, one in life, and must abide one in fact,\r\nor sink together to common shameful desolation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAVALIER THEORY REFUTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nA remarkable feature of all discussions of questions connected with the\r\npresent civil war, is the lack of any attempt to question the foundation\r\nof important assertions. Our orators and writers have been ready to\r\nexplain or soften adverse statements, but they have rarely questioned\r\nthe existence of any asserted facts. One of the most persistent\r\nassumptions of the secessionists has been that the inhabitants of their\r\nStates are the descendants of the gentry of England, and that the\r\nUnionists of the loyal States have neither any identity of origin nor a\r\nhistorical pedigree. On this assumed fact they build two arguments:\r\nfirst, that being homogeneous, they are united to a degree to which the\r\nNortherners can never attain; secondly, that the English people, and\r\nespecially the English gentry, are closely allied to them in blood, and\r\nshould naturally sympathize with them in their voluntary opposition to\r\nthe constituted Government.\r\n\r\nI propose to show that not only are these assertions unfounded, but that\r\nthe reverse is the truth; and this I feel authorized in doing for\r\nseveral reasons.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, if there be no advantage in placing ourselves right\r\nin our own eyes, our cause can be advanced in the eyes of foreign\r\nobservers, by the publication of the truth. Were the facts as\r\nrepresented, an Englishman would be justified, to a certain degree, in\r\nsympathizing with a large number of the descendants of Englishmen,\r\nengaged in a revolt against a superior number of foreigners. His intense\r\nnationality, which has so long given his nation an undue influence,\r\nleads him to take this view, and his belief in English invincibility\r\ncauses him to prejudge the case, and to deem the subjugation of his\r\nSouthern relatives an impossibility.\r\n\r\nSecondly, class prejudices are aroused everywhere in Europe by the idea\r\nthat a nation of gentlemen is contending for every right against a\r\nvulgar crowd; the idea of what in reality constitutes an American\r\ndemocracy being still exceedingly nebulous to the European mind.\r\n\r\nThirdly, we have borne too long the imputation thus cast on us, for our\r\nown good in the management of our own affairs. Already expression has\r\nbeen given to threats of ultimate division of the North into separate\r\nnationalities, on the ground that we have no common interests and no\r\ncommon origin. It seems well, therefore, to investigate the data at\r\nhand, and to see if the South be so united or the North so divided as\r\nalleged.\r\n\r\nA few tables, prepared from the official Census returns, will serve to\r\nplace the question in a clear light, and they will be easily confirmed\r\nor rejected.\r\n\r\nI assume in the following table that the inhabitants of the United\r\nStates were citizens by birth, and by deducting at the end of each\r\ndecade the number of immigrants, we have what may fairly be claimed as\r\nthe percentage of natural increase. I have added the slight excess over\r\nthe percentage to the column of native born, believing this advantage at\r\nleast belongs to them:\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nTABLE NO.

But a little more research shows that the case is\r\nmuch more unfavorable.\r\n\r\nUp to 1840, the Southern States not only could have furnished all the\r\nsettlers in the Slave States, but must have sent out colonists. In 1840,\r\nthey had 4,604,873 inhabitants; add to this the natural increase, 25.1\r\nper cent. (1,155,823), and we have 5,760,696 native born, and 423,781\r\nforeigners required make their total of 6,184,477 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nBut in the next decade, add to the 5,760,696 native born, their\r\npercentage of increase 23.9 (1,376,806), and we have 7,137,502,\r\nrequiring 1,575,338 foreigners, _more than one sixth_, for their total\r\nof 8,712,840 white inhabitants.\r\n\r\nBy no conceivable chance can more than five sixths of the population of\r\nthe South be descended from the English cavaliers.\r\n\r\nBut if we concede to every Virginian, not only his inherent gentility,\r\nbut his unswerving purpose never to emigrate out of slave territory, and\r\nan intuitive presentiment which pointed out which were to be the slave\r\nportions of adjacent Territories, by these same percentages of increase\r\nthe 442,215 Virginian cavaliers of 1790 could be the progenitors of only\r\n2,785,927 patricians to rally around the model cavalier of\r\n1860--Jefferson Davis.\r\n\r\nLastly, in an estimate published in 1848 by Mr. Jesse Pickering, devoted\r\nentirely to the consideration of immigration as a national question, it\r\nis argued, with every appearance of truth, that in 1840 the foreign\r\npopulation of the Slave States was 1,177,965. But these must have\r\ndisplaced an equal number of the native born, and we should have only\r\n3,426,908 of that class in 1840, 4,287,061 in 1850, and 5,311,668 in\r\n1860, or in that case only five eighths of the population could be of\r\nnative descent, provided that not one emigrated. When we consider that\r\nthe great immigration of all was between 1840 and 1860, we are forced to\r\nconclude that certainly not more than one half of the inhabitants of the\r\npresent confederate States can present the faintest claim to a descent\r\nfrom the citizens of 1790.\r\n\r\nWhen we seriously endeavor to investigate the claims of Virginians to a\r\ndescent from the English gentry, we are stopped by their practical\r\ndenial of the first principles of genealogy.\r\n\r\nThe public records of their State, as shown by the highest authority,\r\nthe bishop of the diocese, are most imperfect. The records of the\r\nparishes have been lost, the churchyards destroyed, and few authorities,\r\nsave tradition, can be given for these ambitious claims. Bishop Meade's\r\nwork, especially devoted to the history of the 'Old Churches and Old\r\nFamilies of Virginia,' gives less than thirty families, clearly traced,\r\nto the English gentry. These are those of Ambler, Barradall, Baylor,\r\nBushrod, Burwell, Carter, Digges, Fairfax, Fitzhugh, Fowke, Harrison,\r\nJacqueline, Lee, Lewis, Ludwell, Mason, Robinson, Spottswood, Sandys,\r\nand Washington. I believe I have omitted none, and have rather strained\r\na point in admitting some.\r\n\r\nI do not, of course, mean to deny that others may exist, but until the\r\nproofs are submitted to examination, there is no justice in presuming\r\nthem to exist. Let us see how far the historians of Virginia support the\r\n'cavalier' theory. Robert Beverley (I quote from the edition published\r\nat Richmond in 1855) says:\r\n\r\n     'Those that went over to that country first, were chiefly single\r\n     men who had not the incumbrance of wives and children in England;\r\n     and if they had, they did not expose them to the fatigue and hazard\r\n     of so long a voyage, until they saw how it should fare with\r\n     themselves. From hence it came to pass, that when they were settled\r\n     there in a comfortable way of subsisting a family, they grew\r\n     sensible of the misfortune of wanting wives, and such as had left\r\n     wives in England sent for them, but the single men were put to\r\n     their shifts. They excepted against the Indian women on account of\r\n     their being pagans, as well as their complexions, and for fear\r\n     they should conspire with those of their own nation to destroy\r\n     their husbands. Under this difficulty they had no hopes but that\r\n     the plenty in which they lived might invite modest women, of small\r\n     fortunes, to go over thither from England. However, they would not\r\n     receive any but such as could carry sufficient certificate of their\r\n     modesty and good behavior. Those, if they were but moderately\r\n     qualified in all other respects, might depend upon marrying very\r\n     well in those days, without any fortune. Nay, the first planters\r\n     were so far from expecting money with a woman, that 'twas a common\r\n     thing for them to buy a deserving wife that carried good\r\n     testimonials of her character, at the price of one hundred pounds,\r\n     and make themselves believe they had a bargain.\r\n\r\n     '§67. But this way of peopling the colony was only at first. For\r\n     after the advantages of the climate and the fruitfulness of the\r\n     soil were well known, and all the dangers incident to infant\r\n     settlements were over, people of better condition retired thither\r\n     with their families, either to increase the estates they had\r\n     before, or to avoid being persecuted for their principles of\r\n     religion or government.\r\n\r\n     'Thus in the time of the rebellion in England _several_ good\r\n     cavalier families went thither with their effects to escape the\r\n     tyranny of the usurper, or acknowledgment of his title. And so\r\n     again, upon the Restoration, many people of the opposite party took\r\n     refuge there, to shelter themselves from the king's resentment. But\r\n     Virginia had not many of these last, because that country was\r\n     famous for holding out the longest for the royal family of any of\r\n     the English dominions.[13] For which reason the Roundheads went,\r\n     for the most part, to New England, as did most of those that in the\r\n     reign of King Charles II were molested on account of their\r\n     religion, though some of these fell likewise to the share of\r\n     Virginia.\r\n\r\n     As for malefactors condemned to transportation, though the greedy\r\n     planter will always buy them, yet it is to be feared they will be\r\n     very injurious to the country, which has already suffered many\r\n     murders and robberies, the effect of that new law of England.'\r\n\r\nBeverley notes also about these servants that 'a white woman is rarely\r\nor never put to work in the ground, if she be good for anything else.'\r\n\r\nBishop Meade (vol. i, p. 89) speaks also of these female servants:\r\n\r\n     'While the company and the Governor were endeavoring to improve the\r\n     condition of the colony, by selecting a hundred young females of\r\n     good character, to be wives to the laborers on the farms of\r\n     Virginia, King James had determined to make of the colony a Botany\r\n     Bay for the wretched convicts in England, and ordered one hundred\r\n     to be sent over. The company remonstrated, but in vain. A large\r\n     portion, if not all of them, were actually sent. The influence of\r\n     this must have been pernicious. Whether it was continued by his\r\n     successors, and how long, and to what extent, I know not.'\r\n\r\nAnd again (pp. 365-'6), he says:\r\n\r\n     'The greatest difficulty they (the vestrymen) appear to have had\r\n     was with the hired servants, of whom, at an early period, great\r\n     numbers came over to this country, binding themselves to the richer\r\n     families. The number of illegitimate children born of them and\r\n     thrown upon the parish, led to much action on the part of the\r\n     vestries and the legislature. _The lower order of persons in\r\n     Virginia, in a great measure, sprang from these apprenticed\r\n     servants and from poor exiled culprits.'_\r\n\r\nStith says (ed. 1747, p. 103), under date of 1609:\r\n\r\n     'But a great part of this new company consisted of unruly sparks,\r\n     packed off by their friends to escape worse destinies at home. And\r\n     the rest were chiefly made up of poor gentlemen, broken tradesmen,\r\n     rakes, and libertines, footmen, and such others as were much fitter\r\n     to spoil or ruin a commonwealth, than to help to raise or maintain\r\n     one.'\r\n\r\nAgain (p. 306), in describing one of the domestic quarrels of the\r\ncolony, he copies a statement:\r\n\r\n     'And whereas it was affirmed that very few of his majesty's\r\n     servants were lost in those days, and those persons of the meanest\r\n     rank, they replied that for one that then died, five had perished\r\n     in Sir Thomas Smith's time, many being of ancient houses, and born\r\n     to estates of a thousand pounds a year, some more, some less, who\r\n     likewise perished by famine.'\r\n\r\nThese extracts are all that I can urge in support of the claim of\r\nVirginians to be descended from the English gentry. There may be many\r\nother authorities; it is for the asserters of this theory to produce\r\nthem, and I certainly would republish them if I could obtain them.\r\n\r\nLet us, however, leave Virginia for a time, to consider the origin of\r\nthe inhabitants of Delaware, Maryland, the Carolinas, Georgia, and those\r\nother confederate States which also claim the honor of an English\r\npaternity. Here our means of information become more plain and\r\naccessible. From about 1730 up to the time of the Revolution, these\r\ncolonies were the object of the constant attention of England. The wars\r\nwith France and Spain and the projects of the proprietors of these\r\ngrants of land combined to make the public of England anxious for\r\ninformation concerning them. I will merely cite from the _London\r\nMagazine_ of that date, though a more extended search, I doubt not,\r\nwould add to the strength of my position. I find in the first place that\r\nthe new population was not only not cavalier, but not even English. I\r\nfind that 'the design of this settlement (Georgia) was to provide an\r\nasylum or place of refuge for the honest industrious poor, and the\r\nunfortunate, with some view to the relief of the persecuted Protestants\r\nin Germany. Among these unfortunate persons it could not be guarded\r\nagainst that numbers, unfortunate only by their own vices or follies,\r\nintruded themselves among the real 'objects of charity.' In 1737, these\r\nSaltzburghers had built a town, Ebenezer, in Georgia. Mr. Oglethorpe\r\nalso 'planted upon the fourth frontier, at a place called by him Darien,\r\na colony of Scottish Highlanders.' 'The southernmost settlement in South\r\nCarolina is now the town of Purrysburg, which was built by Captain\r\nPurry, a gentleman of Swisserland, at the head of a number of his own\r\ncountrymen, who went over with him soon after that country became a\r\nroyal government.' In 1765 a new fort was built 'on the Savannah river,\r\nabout fifteen miles above Hillsborough township, which will be of great\r\nuse to the three new settlements of Irish, French, and German\r\nProtestants.' In 1762, 'the Governor of South Carolina has granted forty\r\nthousand acres of land to be laid out into two townships for a number of\r\npeople from Ireland, who are expected here.'\r\n\r\nIn 1762, 'upward of six hundred German emigrants, men, women, and\r\nchildren, consisting of Wurtzburghers and Palatines, all Protestants,\r\nwho were brought here by one Colonel Stumpel, with a promise to be\r\nimmediately settled in America,' were landed in England, and charitably\r\naided to go to South Carolina. In 1766, I read of Florida, 'the\r\nprincipal town is Pensacola, and as many of the French, who inhabited\r\nhere before the treaty, have chose to become British subjects for the\r\nsake of keeping their estates,' that more foreigners were added to the\r\nSouthern colonies.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickett, whose history of Alabama was published at Charleston, S.\r\nC., in 1851, adds, 'a company of forty Jews, acting under the broad\r\nprinciple of the charter, which gave freedom to all religions, save that\r\nof the Romish Church, landed at Savannah. Much dissatisfaction, both in\r\nEngland and America, arose in consequence of these Israelites, and\r\nOglethorpe was solicited to send them immediately from the colony. He,\r\nhowever, generously permitted them to remain, which was one of the\r\nwisest acts of his life, for they and their descendants were highly\r\ninstrumental in developing the commercial resources of this wild land.'\r\n'The colony of Georgia had prospered under the wise guidance of\r\nOglethorpe. The colonists, being from different nations, were various in\r\ntheir characters and religious creeds. Vaudois, Swiss, Piedmontese,\r\nGermans, Moravians, Jews from Portugal, Highlanders, English, and\r\nItalians were thrown together in this fine climate, new world, and new\r\nhome.'\r\n\r\nEven Virginia was not entirely English. Barber's account of the State\r\n(p. 451) says of the valley of the Shenandoah:\r\n\r\n     'The eastern part of the valley being conveniently situated for\r\n     emigrants from Pennsylvania, as well as from lower Virginia, the\r\n     population there came to be a mixture of English Virginians and\r\n     German and Scotch-Irish Presbyterians. The German Pennsylvanians,\r\n     being passionate lovers of fat lands, no sooner heard of the rich\r\n     valleys of the Shenando and its branches, than they began to join\r\n     their countrymen from Europe in pouring themselves forth over the\r\n     country above Winchester. Finding the main Shenando mostly\r\n     preoccupied, they followed up the north and south branches on both\r\n     sides of the Massanutten, or Peaked Mountain, until they filled up\r\n     all the beautiful vales of the country for the space of sixty\r\n     miles. So completely did they occupy the country, that the few\r\n     stray English or Irish settlers among them did not sensibly affect\r\n     the homogeneousness of the population.'\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n     'The first settlements of this portion of the valley were made by\r\n     the Scotch Irish, with a few original Scotch among them. They\r\n     settled in the neighorhoods around Martinsburg, in Berkely county,\r\n     Winchester, and almost the entire counties of Orange and Guilford.\r\n     The same race went on into North Carolina, and settled in the\r\n     counties of Orange and Guilford, especially in the northern and\r\n     middle parts of the latter county.'\r\n\r\nBeverley writes (p. 228):\r\n\r\n     'The French refugees sent in thither by the charitable exhibition\r\n     of his late majesty King William, are naturalized by a particular\r\n     law for that purpose. In the year 1699 there went over about three\r\n     hundred of these, and in the year following about two hundred more,\r\n     and so on, till there arrived in all between seven and eight\r\n     hundred men, women, and children, who had fled from France on\r\n     account of their religion.'\r\n\r\nBishop Meade (ii. 75) writes:\r\n\r\n     'That twelve Protestant German families, consisting of about fifty\r\n     persons, arrived, April 17th, in Virginia, and were therein settled\r\n     near the Rappahannock river. That in 1717, seventeen Protestant\r\n     German families, consisting of about fourscore persons, came and\r\n     set down near their countrymen. And many more, both German and\r\n     Swiss families, are likely to come there and settle likewise.'\r\n\r\nThis report was made in 1720.\r\n\r\nThese facts show in the clearest manner that a great percentage of the\r\ninhabitants of the seceding States are not of English origin. Even the\r\nEnglish were not all Cavalier and Episcopalian. The _London Magazine_,\r\nin an 'Account of the British Plantations,' says:\r\n\r\n     'What contributed much more toward the establishment of the colony,\r\n     was their granting a plenary indulgence to people of all religions,\r\n     as by their charter they were empowered to do; for by this great\r\n     numbers of dissenters were induced to sell their estates in England\r\n     and transport themselves and families to Carolina; so that by the\r\n     year 1670 a numerous colony was at once sent out.'\r\n\r\nOne last consideration, of possible impurity of blood, and I will\r\nproceed to examine the antecedents of those colonists who were of\r\nEnglish blood.\r\n\r\nIn 1853, a memoir of James Fontaine was published, accompanied by\r\nletters from members of his family. He was a Huguenot, who had settled\r\nin Virginia, and his descendants have been among the most distinguished\r\nof her citizens.\r\n\r\nThe letters of his sons to relatives in England are very instructive. I\r\nquote from one from Peter Fontaine, dated March 2, 1756, in which he\r\nregrets that the English had not intermarried with the Indians:\r\n\r\n     'But here methinks I can hear you observe, 'What! Englishmen\r\n     intermarry with Indians?' But I can convince you that they are\r\n     guilty of much more heinous practices, more unjustifiable in the\r\n     sight of God and man (if that indeed may be called a bad practice);\r\n     for many base wretches among us take up with negro women, by which\r\n     means the country swarms with mulatto bastards, and these\r\n     mulattoes, if but three generations removed from the black father\r\n     or mother, may, by the indulgence of the laws of the country,\r\n     intermarry with the white people, _and actually do every day so\r\n     marry_.'\r\n\r\nThis is the testimony of a Virginian gentleman, made a century ago; I do\r\nnot care to more than point to the possible infusion of other than\r\nEnglish blood into the veins of the gentlemen who desire to adopt the\r\nCavalier as their national device.\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to examine the social position, prior to the emigration,\r\nof those Englishmen who did in a certain degree colonize the present\r\nSlave States, and in a much greater degree colonize New England. I must\r\nconfess having long wondered at the persistent statement of Englishmen\r\nthat the citizens of the United States were the offspring of the\r\nvagabonds and felons of Europe. Having examined the history of the\r\nfamilies of New England with much interest, and finding therein no\r\nconfirmation of this idea, I had held it but the outbreak of prejudice\r\nand ignorance. Yet since the present rebellion has caused so much\r\ninquiry into the antecedents of the Southerners, I find that the\r\nassertion is well founded, but that it concerns those who have hitherto\r\nbeen loudest in their claims to a distinguished ancestry.\r\n\r\nI find among the items of monthly intelligence in the _London Magazine_,\r\nthe records of felons sentenced to transportation to his majesty's\r\nplantations in America, and often the different colonies named. I find a\r\ncalculation incidentally made, about 1750, that 500 culprits were hung\r\nannually in Great Britain--and bloody as the circuits then were, I\r\ncannot believe that less than ten times that number annually received\r\nthe questionable charity of expatriation. I will give a few extracts to\r\nshow the foundation upon which Southern society has been erected.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1732, '68 men and 50 women, felons convict, were carried\r\nfrom Newgate to Black Fryars, and put on board a lighter to be carried\r\ndown the river to be shipped on board the Cæsar, off of Deptford, for\r\ntransportation to Virginia.' January, 1736: 'This morning 140 felons\r\nconvict for transportation, were carried from Newgate, and shipped for\r\nthe plantations, and 18 likewise from the new gaol at Southwark.' In\r\nMay, 106 were also so shipped. In 1738, 126 were shipped at one time\r\n'for the plantations.' In 1739, 127 were shipped 'to America.' In 1741,\r\n9 of the felons on board a ship lying at Blackwall, 'to be transported\r\nto Virginia,' made a bold dash to escape. In May, 1747, 'We are informed\r\nthat several large ships sailed lately from Liverpool with the rebel\r\nprisoners, under a strong convoy to Virginia and Maryland, and other of\r\nhis majesty's plantations, which makes the whole of what have been\r\ntransported upward of 1,000.' In January, 1749, 'the 'Laura,' with 135\r\nconvicts, bound to Maryland, was cast away.' In 1754, Mr. Stewart was\r\nthe contractor to transport convicts 'to America.' In 1758, '63 men and\r\nwomen transports were sent from Newgate on board the ship 'Trial,' bound\r\nto Maryland, and 45 from the new gaol, Southwark.' Later in the same\r\nyear, 53 'for America'--36 men and 20 women 'for the plantations.' In\r\n1761, a ship sails with 8 men and 27 women 'convicts to America.' In\r\nOctober, '27 women and 18 men from Newgate, 14 from the new gaol, and 62\r\nfrom the country gaols, were transported to America this month.' In\r\n1762, 36 women and 5 men convicts were shipped 'to America;' '62\r\nconvicts were embarked for Maryland.'\r\n\r\nIn 1766, I find: 'The above observation occurred to my mind a few days\r\nago, on seeing the convicts pass along to the water side, in order to be\r\nshipped for America, with fifes playing before them, 'Through the wood,\r\nladdie,' '--as an evidence that the practice was then in force and a\r\nmatter of course.\r\n\r\nIn a 'Tour through the British Plantations,' published in this magazine,\r\nin 1755, which contains a good account of each colony, I read of\r\nVirginia that under Sir Edwyn Sandys, 'there were 12,000 acres laid off\r\nfor the use of the company, and 100 tenants or planters sent to be\r\nplaced thereon; and 3,000 acres for the support of the Governor, for the\r\nplanting of which 100 more men were sent; and what was now become\r\nabsolutely necessary, there were no less than 90 young women, of a\r\nhealthful constitution, and unspotted reputation, sent out to be married\r\nto the planters, instead of diseased and profligate strumpets, _as is\r\nnow_ the ridiculous practice.... Thus the company and colony began to be\r\nin a thriving way: but now they began to be oppressed by the Government\r\nhere, for in November they were ordered to send over to Virginia, at\r\ntheir own charge, 100 felons or vagabonds, then it may be supposed in\r\nprison, which they were obliged to comply with.'\r\n\r\nThe same writer says of Maryland:\r\n\r\n     'The convicts that are transported here sometimes prove very worthy\r\n     creatures and entirely forsake their former follies; but the trade\r\n     has for some time run in another channel; and so many volunteer\r\n     servants come over, especially Irish, that the other is a commodity\r\n     much blown over. Several of the best planters, or their ancestors,\r\n     have, in the two colonies,[14] been originally of the convict\r\n     class, and therefore are much to be praised and esteemed for\r\n     forsaking their old courses.'\r\n\r\nIn 1751 (p. 293) is printed the following:\r\n\r\n     'A LETTER LATELY PUBLISHED IN VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n     'SIR: When we see our papers filled continually with accounts of\r\n     the most audacious robberies, the most cruel murders, and infinite\r\n     other atrocities perpetrated by convicts transported from Europe,\r\n     what melancholy, what terrible reflections must it occasion! What\r\n     will become of our posterity? These are some of thy favors,\r\n     Britain! Thou art called our mother country; but what good mother\r\n     ever sent thieves and villains to accompany her children; to\r\n     corrupt some with their infectious vices, and murder the rest? What\r\n     father ever endeavored to spread the plague in his family! We do\r\n     not ask fish, but thou givest us serpents, and worse than serpents!\r\n     In what can Britain show a more sovereign contempt for us, than by\r\n     emptying their gaols into our settlements, unless they would\r\n     likewise empty their offal upon our tables? What must we think of\r\n     that board, which has advised the repeal of every law we have\r\n     hitherto made to prevent this deluge of wickedness overwhelming us;\r\n     and with this cruel sarcasm, that these laws were against the\r\n     public utility, for they tended to prevent the improvement and well\r\n     peopling of the colonies! And what must we think of those\r\n     merchants, who, for the sake of a little paltry gain, will be\r\n     concerned in importing and disposing of these abominable cargoes?'\r\n\r\nWith these quotations I would leave the subject to the consideration of\r\nevery unprejudiced judgment. Is it not for the Southerner, even for the\r\nVirginian, to produce further evidence of his Cavalier descent before it\r\ncan be allowed? We see abundant proofs, taken from authorities in no way\r\nconnected with the present inimical feelings of the North and South,\r\nthat a very large portion of the English colonists consisted of\r\ntransported felons. To this direct evidence--which can only be rebutted\r\nby evidence of the extinction of the descendants of this class and the\r\ninfusion of an equal amount of gentle blood--we have thus far only the\r\nfact of the presence of a very few good families, and the boasts of\r\nprejudiced partisans.\r\n\r\nAnd now, after having indicated the grounds for a careful criticism of\r\nSouthern claims, let me assert the claims of New England, not to gentle\r\nblood, but to a purely English ancestry. Here we come at once upon solid\r\nground, and the authorities are numerous and trustworthy. Genealogy has,\r\nfor the past ten or twelve years, been a favorite study in New England;\r\nand, as Sir Bernard Burke writes, 'for ten or twelve years before the\r\ncivil conflict broke out ... Massachusetts was more genealogical than\r\nYorkshire, and Boston sustained what London never did, a magazine\r\ndevoted exclusively to genealogy.' The history of different families,\r\nthe records of nearly all the older towns, the colonial records, have\r\nall been placed in print. Many of these books are larger than any\r\nEnglish works on the subject, and are monuments of patient industry.\r\nAfter such researches we may claim to speak intelligently of our\r\nancestry, and to point to the proofs of our assertions. In one work,\r\ncontained in four volumes, covering two thousand five hundred pages, Mr.\r\nSavage has attempted to record the names of the settlers of New England\r\nand of two generations of their descendants. Imperfect as such an\r\nattempt may be, what other section of our country or any nation can\r\npretend to such a knowledge of its antecedents? I give the result of his\r\ntwenty years' study in his own words:\r\n\r\n     'From long and careful research I have judged the proportion of the\r\n     whole number living here in 1775, that deduce their origin from the\r\n     kingdom of England, i.e., the southern part of Great Britain,\r\n     excluding also the principality of Wales, to exceed ninety-eight\r\n     in a hundred.'\r\n\r\n     'A more homogeneous stock cannot be seen, I think, in any so\r\n     extensive a region at any time, since that when the ark of Noah\r\n     discharged its passengers on Mount Ararat, except in the few\r\n     centuries elapsing before the confusion of Babel.'\r\n\r\nSo much for the idle slander that New England has no records nor\r\nhomogeneity.\r\n\r\nAs to the other alleged stigma of Puritanism. Could Virginia maintain\r\nher claim to a Cavalier ancestry instead of failing on even a\r\nsuperficial scrutiny, the contrast attempted to be drawn between Puritan\r\nand Cavalier is based on a fallacy. When these colonies were\r\nestablished, the distinction was a political one as clearly as the\r\nsucceeding divisions of Whig and Tory. In those days the gentry were the\r\nleaders--the Puritan was as much a gentleman in the technical English\r\nsense as the Cavalier. To take an instance which will strike our\r\nVirginia friends, who quote the Fairfaxes and Washingtons: Lord Fairfax,\r\nthe Puritan, married the daughter of Lord Vere, 'a zealous Presbyterian\r\nand disaffected to the king.' Their daughter married the gay Cavalier,\r\nduke of Buckingham.\r\n\r\nThe Washingtons were connections, and rather humble ones, of the\r\nSpencers. Yet the latest account of the families show Henry Lord Spencer\r\n'standing by the side of the Lords Northumberland and Essex, and the\r\nother noblemen who were afterward the leaders of the Parliament during\r\nthe civil war.'\r\n\r\nPuritan and Cavalier! The phrase only means that those, both of gentry\r\nand yeomanry, who had sufficient brains to understand liberty, and the\r\ncourage to fight for it, combined and forever broke the chains of royal\r\nor oligarchical oppression. If the gentry were a minority in the party,\r\nso much the less reason to boast of such an ancestry.\r\n\r\nStill, as no point in a contest should be thrown away, let it be avowed\r\nthat Puritanic New England could always display a greater array of\r\n'gentlemen by birth' than Virginia, or even the entire South. This is\r\nsaid deliberately, because we know whereof we speak. If the fact be of\r\nservice in any way, it can easily be substantiated. A list of such names\r\nas I can at present remember is longer than any list I have been able to\r\ncollect from Southern publications. These are, Adams, Amory, Anderson,\r\nAppleton, Belcher, Bond, Bowdoin, Bromfield, Browne, Burrill, Chauncy,\r\nChester, Chute, Checkley, Clark, Clarke, Cotton, Coolidge, Corwin,\r\nCradock, Davenport, Downing, Dudley, Dummer, Eyre, Fairfax, Foxcroft,\r\nGiffard, Jaffrey, Jeffries, Johnson, Hawthorne, Herrick, Holyoke,\r\nHutchinson, Lawrence, Lake, Lechmere, Legge, Leverett, Lloyd, Lowell,\r\nMascarene, Mather, Miner, Norton, Oliver, Pepperell, Phips, Phippen,\r\nPrince, Pynchon, Saltonstall, Sears, Sewall, Thornton, Usher, Vassall,\r\nWard, Wendell, Wetmore, Wilson, Winslow, Winthrop, Wyllys.\r\n\r\nI insert this list only for the benefit of those who have yielded to the\r\nclaims of Virginia through ignorance on points which are peculiarly the\r\ncare of genealogists. It can easily be extended, and every year, as our\r\nrecords are more fully examined, it will increase.\r\n\r\nIf we leave the dry details, which I have presented simply as\r\nindications of the method in which this question can be discussed, and\r\nregard the problem in a more general view, it is surprising to see how\r\ntheory and fact agree. The United States are essentially English to-day,\r\ndespite the millions of foreigners which have been absorbed into its\r\npopulation. The tendency of its citizens has been toward a democracy,\r\nand yet not toward anarchy and lawlessness. The throes of a gigantic\r\nrevolution have not sufficed to outweigh the instinctive love of law and\r\norder peculiar to the English race. Though events unforeseen by the\r\nauthors of the Federal Constitution have called for exercises of power,\r\nobscurely permitted perhaps by that instrument, yet unknown to former\r\npractice, still there has been no popular convulsion at the North, no\r\narmed outbreak, no phrensy of mob power. There is as yet no such thing\r\nknown as an American mob.\r\n\r\nWhen we inquire what controlling influence has impressed this form upon\r\nthe national character, the enemies of the predominant party\r\ninstinctively show that it is New England. Not the comparatively limited\r\nNew England of 1863, but the New England stock and influence which has\r\ninvigorated nearly every State of the Union. In their ignorance of the\r\npast, these revilers of New England have been blindly attacking a\r\ngreater fact than they were aware of. Not only is nearly a third part of\r\nour native-born population the offspring of the New England of the\r\nRevolution, but long before that time the intermixture had commenced.\r\nWhitehead's 'New Jersey' (p. 159) quotes Governor Burnet's letter,\r\nwritten in 1729:\r\n\r\n     'The people of New Jersey (being generally of New England\r\n     extraction, and therefore enthusiasts) would consider the number of\r\n     planters, etc., as a repetition of the same sin as David committed\r\n     in numbering the people.'\r\n\r\nThe History of Dorchester, Massachusetts, quotes a letter from the\r\nSecretary of Georgia, in 1755, in relation to a colony from that town,\r\nin which he says:\r\n\r\n     'I really look upon these people moving here to be one of the most\r\n     favorable circumstances that could befall the colony.'\r\n\r\nIt is added:\r\n\r\n     'This settlement has furnished Georgia with two governors, two of\r\n     its most distinguished judges, the theological seminary of South\r\n     Carolina and Georgia with an able professor, the Methodist\r\n     Episcopal Church with an influential and pious bishop, the\r\n     Presbyterian and Baptist Churches of that State with many of their\r\n     ablest and most useful ministers; and six of her sons have been\r\n     called to professorial chairs in collegiate institutions.'\r\n\r\nThe first attempt at colonizing the Mississippi delta was made by the\r\nLymans, Dwights, and their associates from Connecticut. New York\r\nreceived a constant accession from New England long before 1775.\r\n\r\nHere, then, history and theory both agree. New England, colonized by\r\nEnglishmen, homogeneous in a remarkable degree, has been the only\r\nthoroughly pure nationality within our territories. The few stray\r\nEnglishmen of education in the Southern colonies, the much greater\r\nnumber of convicts, the increasing immigration of French, Irish, Scotch,\r\nand German settlers, have not only failed to overwhelm this compact and\r\nthoroughly alive minority, but have been formed and moulded into shape\r\nby it. In protesting against New England, the Vallandighams and Coxes\r\nare only proving the nullity of 'expunging resolutions.' 'Can they make\r\nthat not to be which has been?' Until they can recall the past,\r\nannihilate the past inhabitants of these States, and from stones raise\r\nup some other progenitors for the present generation, they cannot\r\ndestroy the influence of New England.\r\n\r\nAnd yet we are called upon to believe that the race which has thus done\r\nthe greatest work of the past two centuries was the random aggregation\r\nof opposite and mongrel races, the offspring of ignorance, poverty, and\r\ncrime. We are to believe that while the pure blood of English gentlemen\r\nin Virginia has produced not only the gentlemanly vices of pride,\r\ntreachery, and falsehood in the leaders, but the ignoble faults of crime\r\nand debasement in the 'poor trash'--that some occult influence of\r\nclimate has advanced an entire community at the North far above the\r\nposition of its progenitors--that while the gentle Cavalier has been\r\novercome by the seductive charms of luxury and repose, the ignoble\r\nPuritan has thrown off his degrading antecedents, and has obtained the\r\ncontrol of the allied races. The servant has become the master, the scum\r\nof all nations has overpowered the choicest offspring of that race which\r\nMacaulay terms 'the hereditary rulers of mankind.'\r\n\r\nThese conclusions, so eminently logical and convincing, we must believe,\r\nor we must doubt the pure blood of the aristocracy of the Slave States.\r\n\r\nIs it not more reasonable to believe, as facts daily prove, that New\r\nEngland was colonized from the hardiest and best portion of the English\r\nstock? That our ancestors, accepting the state of English society as a\r\nfact, neither invited nor repelled the accession of the gentry. That\r\nmany of that class did join in the enterprise, and that, where they were\r\nworthy, they received the slight preference which is accorded to\r\npersonal advantages of any sort. That the bulk of the colonists were\r\nseparated from this class by slight barriers, that many of them were\r\nexcluded only by a want of the necessary property to maintain the\r\nposition, and that on this new territory these distinctions were\r\nspeedily forgotten--not because the higher class deteriorated, but\r\nbecause the lower, having but a slight advance to make, soon stood on an\r\nactual equality with them.\r\n\r\nIf the sympathy of England were now as desirable and as strongly\r\nexpected as it was two years ago, I might urge the matter further. As it\r\nis, it seems sufficient to overthrow the claims of Southerners, based\r\nupon false pretences, and supported only by unblushing effrontery, and\r\nto refute the slanders which have been thrown upon an entire section of\r\nthe loyal States.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Yet our author had already shown that Dennis, Cromwell's\r\ncaptain, 'contrived a stratagem which betrayed the country. He had got a\r\nconsiderable parcel of goods aboard, which belonged to two of the\r\nCouncil, and found a method of informing them of it. By this means they\r\nwere reduced to the dilemma, either of submitting or losing their goods.\r\nThis caused factions amongst them, so that at last'--we blush to\r\nadd--'the colony surrendered--and saved the goods.' _En dat Virginia\r\nquintam._ The fifth crown had its price, even for a 'usurper.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Virginia was the other of which he was writing.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY ARBUTUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Give me water, give air, give me light!\r\n    Oh, as life in my heart ebbs away,\r\n  I pine through the dim, chilly night,\r\n    I long for the sun's kindly ray!\r\n      Even I, a poor little Arbutus!\r\n\r\n  I was plucked from my beautiful earth,\r\n    And my soul it then quitted its form;\r\n  What since has my life e'er been worth?\r\n    Ah, would I had never been born!\r\n      Thus I sigh, a poor little Arbutus!\r\n\r\n  Now to man in my anguish I cry:\r\n    Ah, but what for a sigh does he care?\r\n  To heaven I now raise my eye,\r\n    And mourn in my futile despair!\r\n      Even I, a poor, dying Arbutus!\r\n\r\n  Ah, a life for a life--it is just!\r\n    But a life for a nothing, oh, cruel!\r\n  Still low must I languish in dust?\r\n    And is there for me no renewal?\r\n      Ah, for me, poor, broken Arbutus!\r\n\r\n  Into elements now I resolve,\r\n    Yet to life I still cling with each breath;\r\n  As slowly away I dissolve,\r\n    Life's sweeter as closer to death!\r\n      Unto me, but a little Arbutus!\r\n\r\n  Too precocious the life which I bore,\r\n    Which I drew sweetly in with each breath!\r\n  The fulness of life did no more\r\n    Than ripen a fruitage for death,\r\n      Within me, a too early Arbutus!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD YEAR OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew persons, at the beginning of this unhappy war, anticipated its\r\nprolongation to the present day. The projected rebellion was so daring\r\nand sudden in its appearance, so utterly causeless and reckless in its\r\npretexts and objects, that an astounded people could scarcely believe it\r\nto be serious in its character and destined to give them any real and\r\nprotracted trouble. The rebels themselves fed the credulity of their\r\ndeluded victims with the promise of a peaceful separation, or, at the\r\nworst, of a short and triumphant contest, to be speedily followed by a\r\ncareer of boundless prosperity, expansion, greatness, and glory. And, on\r\nour part, when we came at length to understand that war was inevitable,\r\nwe were scarcely less sanguine in our anticipation of easy victory and\r\nof the instant restoration of that noble Government, which the domestic\r\nenemy, with the most wicked ambition, sought to overthrow and utterly\r\ndestroy. Confidently and even boastingly, we contrasted our strength\r\nwith the weakness of the insurrection; we numbered our men in comparison\r\nwith those of the rebellious States, proud of the favorable result; and\r\nwe weighed the means of the adversary with our own, in such scales as\r\nour sanguine hopes and extravagant ideas served only too well to impose\r\nupon us.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate basis of our calculation was undoubtedly sound and solid,\r\nand the anticipated result must eventually come according to our\r\noriginal views, though not within the period then too hastily assigned\r\nfor the duration of the bloody and disastrous contest. The stupendous\r\nforce of our Government is amply sufficient to crush the rebellion in\r\nall its vast proportions, however slowly the great work may be carried\r\non, and however wastefully and unskilfully the national means may be\r\napplied to that indispensable end. Though occasionally baffled in our\r\nprojects, we are still advancing on the whole; and there is evidently no\r\npossible escape for the leaders of the rebellion. They must already\r\nbegin to entertain fearful apprehensions of their certain ultimate doom.\r\nOur great fleet hovers upon their coast and penetrates their bays and\r\nrivers, cutting off most of their commerce with the outside world, and\r\nisolating them within the narrow limits of the territory actually\r\noccupied by them; while our immense armies are pressing them at all\r\nimportant points, with a deliberation and steadiness which evidently\r\nspring from the consciousness of superior strength and the certainty of\r\nultimate triumph. The Mississippi river is virtually open to our\r\ncommerce, or at least to the complete occupation of our gunboats and\r\narmies, and the suffering enemy is thus cut off from his communication\r\nwith Texas, and from the only available resources on which he can\r\nsecurely rely to sustain him much longer in his wicked and desperate\r\ngame of treason. His condition is in the last degree perilous; he seems\r\nto be in the very agony of dissolution, or at least in that stage which\r\nimmediately precedes it. His extremities are already cold with the chill\r\nof mortal congestion; but the fever rages all the more fiercely about\r\nthe vital parts, where the maddened energies of the whole system are\r\nconcentrated in the last desperate struggle for life. Possibly there may\r\nbe a little reaction here and there, or even a violent convulsive effort\r\nof tremendous energy; an incursion may be made into Kentucky, or some\r\ntemporary success achieved in other quarters; but the revival will be\r\ndeceptive and evanescent, and the fitful return of life to the limbs\r\nwill only serve to complete the process of exhaustion and to hasten the\r\nfinal catastrophe.\r\n\r\nAfter two years of civil war, maintained under great embarrassments and\r\ndisadvantages--two memorable years, during which all the malignant\r\npowers of treason and hate have been arrayed against the Union with the\r\ndetermined purpose to destroy it--the condition of the Federal\r\nGovernment is wonderfully good, presenting a vivid contrast to the\r\nwretched poverty and prostration of the ambitious States which have so\r\nrashly assailed it. It would be vain to deny the vast injury suffered by\r\nthe whole nation, from the inauguration and continuance of this most\r\nunnatural strife. It is chiefly this widespread mischief which\r\nconstitutes the stupendous crime of the rebellion. Thousands upon\r\nthousands of valuable lives have been sacrificed; the maimed victims of\r\nthe war appeal to our sympathies on every side; widows and orphans fill\r\nthe whole land with lamentation. These are calamities that cannot be\r\ncompensated by any material prosperity, however great and imposing.\r\nBesides, it is impossible to conceal from ourselves, upon mature\r\nreflection, that in the present marvellous activity of business and the\r\ngreat abundance of money, we are drawing largely on the future, and\r\nmaintaining present prosperity at the cost of burdens which will weigh\r\nheavily both on ourselves and on coming generations. Nevertheless, the\r\nwonderful success of our financial measures and the evidently increasing\r\nstrength of the Government, in spite of its immense efforts, and with\r\nall the alternations of triumph and defeat, of success and failure, of\r\ngood fortune and disaster, cannot fail to inspire every friend of the\r\nUnion with hope and confidence. That this great struggle for national\r\nexistence can be conducted with so little disturbance to the prosperity\r\nof the loyal States, and, indeed, with actual increase of activity and\r\nimmediate success in almost all departments of business, affords the\r\nbest evidence of the solidity and greatness of our country, and of its\r\nability finally to maintain itself against the vast and powerful\r\nconspiracy by which it has been so vigorously assailed. At this moment,\r\nthe domestic foe, notwithstanding his defiant attitude, is actually\r\nwrithing in the grasp of an outraged nation; and the foreign enemies of\r\nour cause, so recently rejoicing in our misfortunes and elated with the\r\nenvious anticipation of our utter overthrow, are now looking on with\r\nsilent apprehension and ill-concealed chagrin at the growing strength we\r\nexhibit with every day's experience in the mighty contest. They are\r\ndisappointed that we are not overwhelmed by every slight check we\r\nsuffer, and astounded that we are not at all discouraged even by serious\r\ndisasters to our arms. We derive renewed energy and courage from our\r\nvery reverses, which give us the inestimable advantage of experience,\r\nand enable us finally to turn misfortune into good. Our determination\r\nbecomes more fixed and immovable with every demand upon our fortitude;\r\nand thus the power of the nation advances steadily through all the\r\nvarying incidents of the struggle, so that now, after these two years of\r\nsanguinary civil war, with the gigantic rebellion still wrestling and\r\nwarring in the bosom of the republic, we yet stand before the world an\r\nobject of respect and fear to those who hate us and wish us evil, while\r\nthe masses of men in all countries, who love liberty and desire to\r\nescape from despotism, still seek our shores as the very Canaan of\r\npromise and the asylum of freedom, even in the midst of our grand\r\nstruggle for existence as a nation.\r\n\r\nIt is the people, in their national capacity, as distinguished from the\r\nmere agents of Government, who present this sublime spectacle to the\r\nview of mankind. The Government for the time being may commit blunders\r\nand follies innumerable; yet behind all these, there is the solid and\r\nenduring judgment of the nation, which will eventually correct all\r\nerrors, and bring back the wandering statesman to the paths of common\r\nsense and ultimate safety. Two years have not sufficed to teach us what\r\nwe require to know in order to bear ourselves altogether nobly and\r\ncalmly in so grand an emergency. We have not yet been sufficiently\r\nschooled in war, and especially in the bitter experience of civil war,\r\nto be able to resist the pressure of great dangers and difficulties,\r\nand, at the same time, to maintain undisturbed all the ordinary\r\noperations of civil life, and to secure due respect for personal rights\r\nand liberties. The mighty and unexampled convulsion of the whole nation,\r\nconsequent on the rebellion of a wealthy and powerful section, which\r\nconstituted the bulk of one great political party in the country, and\r\nwhich necessarily had connections of interest and sympathy with large\r\nnumbers in all the States, has tended to develop party political\r\nanimosities to the highest pitch. This terrible excitement, continued\r\nwithout interruption for two years, has served at least to test the\r\npatriotism of the people, and to determine whether faction was destined\r\nso far to prevail as to paralyze the hand of Government and render\r\nsecession triumphant through our own dissensions. These fearful contests\r\nof party have run their course up to the present time, without serious\r\ntrouble; and it is now apparent that the mass of the people are settled\r\nin their devotion to the Union, and will sustain no man or party in\r\nfactious opposition to the Government, or even in ill-timed exertions to\r\nobtain redress of acknowledged wrongs, when those exertions are\r\ncalculated to embarrass the nation in its mortal struggle for safety and\r\ntriumph. The existence of the nation, its unity and tranquillity, are\r\nparamount to all personal or party rights and interests; and though we\r\nmay be justly indignant that many arbitrary and unnecessary things are\r\ndone, yet must they be borne patiently for the sake of the country. The\r\ntime for accountability will come at last. Under the pressure of vast\r\nresponsibilities and difficulties, the agents of the people may\r\nplausibly, or even justly, excuse themselves for almost any\r\nirregularity; and the most honest and devoted patriot may, with apparent\r\ntruth, be accused of sympathy with the adversary, if he take occasion,\r\nin the midst of great perils, to urge his personal sufferings, to the\r\ninconvenience and annoyance of the Government.\r\n\r\nBut while the last two years have subjected us to great difficulties,\r\nwhich have been happily surmounted, if not with entire immunity from\r\nevil, at least with substantial safety and great preponderance of good,\r\nwe have yet to undergo an ordeal such as every thoughtful man might well\r\nwish to avoid. The greatest of all trials is to come upon us in the\r\ncourse of another year, if, unhappily, the war should last so long.\r\nNothing could be more unfortunate than one of our presidential\r\nelections, to be carried on in the midst of a horrible civil war. It is\r\nimpossible to anticipate the troubles which may ensue--the sympathies\r\nwhich may be expressed for the rebellion--the intolerance which may seek\r\nto suppress freedom of speech under pretext of preventing the\r\nconsequences of treason--and the fearful license of denunciation which\r\nmay be assumed and permitted, under that natural delicacy which would\r\nhesitate to use even a necessary severity against a political enemy and\r\na rival. Deplorable and dangerous excitement is almost certain to\r\nprevail in all quarters; and we may well congratulate ourselves and our\r\ncountry, if we should pass through such a contest without having\r\nnumerous scenes of trouble and even bloodshed in the war of parties, as\r\nepisodes and accompaniments to the grand war of the sections. In its\r\neffects on the national cause at home and abroad, the violence of that\r\nproceeding will be something like one of those lamentable occurrences\r\nwhich sometimes take place in the army, when portions of our own\r\nforces, through misapprehension, turn their arms against each other in\r\nthe face of the enemy. If we shall not actually take each other's lives,\r\nwe shall weaken and distract the country by our dissensions and mutual\r\ndenunciations. Ambition on both sides--on the part of those in power\r\nseeking to retain it and using their authority for that end, and on the\r\npart of their opponents resisting perhaps beyond the bounds of\r\nlegitimate opposition--will shed its baleful influence through the land,\r\nand intensify the animosities naturally arising upon the recurrence of\r\nour great quadrennial struggle.\r\n\r\nYet would that grand emergency offer to a wise and patriotic\r\nAdministration an inestimable opportunity for the noblest exhibition of\r\nunwavering firmness, justice, and self-denial. Should there be presented\r\nan example of perfect singleness of purpose, with no room for suspicion\r\nof sinister objects, or personal ambitions and enmities; should the\r\nAdministration in all its departments, devote itself exclusively to the\r\nsacred work of preserving the nation, regardless of all consequences to\r\nindividuals or parties, then would the approbation of a grateful people\r\nbe its sure reward, and the patriotic masses would take care not only of\r\nthe Government, but of those, also, who had thus nobly and fearlessly\r\nadministered it in the critical hour of its mortal danger. A contrary\r\ncourse would only lead to disaster in the momentous operations of the\r\nwar, and to distraction and weakness among the people, whose duty and\r\ndisposition it is to sustain the Government in all honest efforts to\r\nconquer the rebellion. The temptation insensibly to depart from this\r\npure and patriotic policy is great and almost irresistible. It is so\r\neasy and so natural for one in power to persuade himself that he ought\r\nto retain it, that himself or his party is the only safe depositary of\r\npublic authority, and that the general interest requires him to be\r\nsustained by all the means at his command, _per fas aut nefas_, that few\r\nmen in this country ever avoid the error of using official position and\r\npatronage to promote personal and party ends. This is the very bane and\r\nopprobrium of our institutions. It has already so perverted the\r\ndemocratic system, that men of the highest ability and character no\r\nlonger seek political position, and seldom succeed if they do. Alas for\r\nour country, if this pernicious practice should prevail in conducting\r\nthe tremendous operations of the present civil war!--if the coming\r\npresidential election should be permitted to cast the ominous influence\r\nof party intrigue and official mismanagement upon our struggling armies\r\nand our heavily taxed people! Let us fervently pray that our suffering\r\ncountry may escape this danger. It is in the power of the Administration\r\nin a great measure to control the whole subject; and upon it will rest\r\nthe chief responsibility for any serious error that may be committed. It\r\nwill be responsible not merely for its own conduct, but also for that\r\nwhich it necessitates or provokes on the part of opposing interests and\r\nparties. There must be forbearance, united with firmness and infinite\r\ndiscretion in the use of just authority. A more difficult position was\r\nnever occupied by any party since the organization of the Government.\r\nBut in proportion to the difficulty and responsibility will be the merit\r\nof a wise and successful administration in this most perilous crisis.\r\n\r\nIf the progress of the war thus far, running through more than half of\r\none Administration, has brought us under the ominous shadow of a coming\r\npresidential election, it has, on the other hand, effected a vast\r\nmodification of opinion and feeling on some questions from which the\r\ngreatest disturbances might well have been anticipated. From the\r\nbeginning it was felt to be inevitable that the long continuance of the\r\nwar would seriously affect the relation of master and slave directly in\r\nthe rebellious States, and indirectly in all others wherever that\r\nrelation existed. Far more rapidly than could well have been anticipated\r\nhas this result been effected; but what is of much greater interest and\r\nimportance, the violent prejudices of the people have melted away before\r\nthe inevitable fact, and even the celebrated proclamation no longer\r\nexcites the fierce animadversion with which it was at first greeted.\r\nFrom the escaped slaves of the rebellious States and the free colored\r\nmen of the North, negro regiments have been organized and are still in\r\nprocess of formation. There is no outcry against the policy, but there\r\nseems to be a general acquiescence in the propriety of using the African\r\nrace to assist in putting down the traitors who are ready to overthrow\r\nall free government in order to perpetuate the subjugation of that\r\nunfortunate people. Had the fortunes of war resulted in a speedy\r\nannihilation of the confederate authority, it would have been utterly\r\nimpossible to have made any serious inroad upon the institution of\r\nslavery. Sympathy for the Southern people, and a natural indisposition\r\nto inaugurate fundamental changes, always attended with immense\r\ntemporary disadvantages and inconveniences, would have prevented any\r\nthorough policy of emancipation from being adopted. But the day of\r\nmoderation and compromise has now passed by, probably forever. The\r\npersistence of the rebels in their mad scheme, although their efforts\r\nwere plainly destined to ultimate defeat, has secured for themselves the\r\ngreatest boon which even the highest wisdom in the calmest times could\r\nhave conferred. Their prodigious folly and wickedness have been\r\noverruled by a higher power, and mercifully directed to the complete\r\nregeneration of Southern society. The operation is severe, but in the\r\nend it will be salutary. In a state of continued peace, this could not\r\nhave been done. Scores of years would have been required to prepare the\r\nSouthern mind for it; but now, by one huge convulsive effort, made by\r\nthemselves with far different views, all obstacles are swept away, and\r\nslavery is likely to come to a sudden and final end. A feeble\r\ninsurrection, soon extinguished, would not have accomplished this work;\r\nand even now, if the war should speedily end, there would be serious\r\nembarrassment in disposing of the troublesome questions arising out of\r\nthe subject. The continuance of the war, on its present basis, will soon\r\nsettle the whole difficulty; and among the many tremendous evils and\r\ncalamities attending the progress of the war, this inevitable result is\r\none of the greatest compensations. Few men, perhaps, would have desired,\r\nor, by deliberate action, have promoted this violent destruction even of\r\nso pernicious a system as that which prevailed in the South; but, on the\r\nother hand, with the experience of the last two years, still fewer men,\r\nin the loyal States at least, can be found to deny that the judgment is\r\nrighteous, and that, in the actual circumstances, it is destined to be\r\nin the end as beneficial to the Southern people themselves, as it is, in\r\nits immediate consequences, just in its retribution for their enormous\r\ncrime. In the progress of so tremendous a war, in which, notwithstanding\r\nits origin and cause, the insurrectionary States have strangely been\r\nenabled to command foreign capital, together with the sympathy and even\r\nthe indirect assistance of foreign powers, it would have been\r\nshortsighted in the extreme to have anticipated that slavery would\r\nescape attack. Though made the pretext for violence, and prominently put\r\nforward as the justification of rebellion, it was evidently the weakest\r\npoint in the rebel cause, and was, therefore, alike from the choice of\r\nthe rebels as from the necessity of the Government, destined to become\r\nthe central object and pivotal point of the whole contest. Having once\r\nbeen placed in this position, and fixed in it by the inveterate\r\nenmities of prolonged war, it must from that time abide the arbitrament\r\nof arms. Two years of fierce and calamitous war seem to have brought the\r\nSouth to this alternative: either to restore the Union with immediate\r\nfreedom to the slaves, or to accomplish its dissolution, with a doubtful\r\nand troubled continuance of the system for an uncertain period in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nIf the continuance of the struggle thus far has done so much toward a\r\nfinal settlement of the most troublesome of all questions growing out of\r\nthe contest between the North and the South; if it has probably prepared\r\nthe way for disposing of slavery in all the States where it now exists,\r\nand even given the African a _status_ as a soldier of the republic; it\r\nhas also had an equal effect in other important aspects. It has tended\r\nto develop and settle definitely the political objects and purposes of\r\nthe contending parties. With the South, these, to some degree, have\r\nnecessarily been changed. The original designs of the rebels, whatever\r\nthey may have been in the beginning, have been modified according to the\r\nstringent exigencies of their condition. Their daring and ambitious\r\nplans have been restrained by the public opinion of the civilized world,\r\nand still more by the limitation of their own resources. So long as\r\ntheir strength was untried, imagination ran riot, and there was no bound\r\nto the magnificence of their bad schemes. But the experience of two\r\nyears has taught them that, in their realization, all such wild dreams\r\nare destined to be curtailed within the inexorable limits of\r\npossibility. They have only begun to discover how narrow these limits\r\nare to them. Unexpected obstacles have arisen on every side, and the\r\nsoaring purposes of the rebellion have vainly beaten their bruised and\r\nwearied wings against the solid walls which circumscribe them within the\r\nhumble limits of their present uncertain hopes and expectations. The\r\nFederal Government, on the other hand, has not changed its purpose, as\r\navowed in the beginning, to restore the national authority, in its unity\r\nand integrity, over the whole country. The prospect of accomplishing\r\nthis end has grown brighter from the beginning. We have passed through\r\nalmost all phases of party excitement; faction has tried its perilous\r\nexperiments upon the national temper; divisions have been industriously\r\nfomented; and for a time discord has threatened seriously to weaken us.\r\nBut the patriotism of the people has finally prevailed, and the question\r\nmay now be considered settled. The people not less than the Government\r\nare fully committed to the grand purpose of putting down the rebellion\r\nand restoring the Union. Nor does this work, immense as it is, seem to\r\nbe disproportioned to the national means and energies. The people\r\nbelieve themselves competent to the mighty task, and with this patriotic\r\nconfidence, the undertaking is already more than half accomplished. The\r\nenemy has not the power to defeat our purpose. By our own unhappy\r\ndivisions, we might possibly defeat ourselves; but with a united and\r\ndetermined people, there is not the slightest room for doubt.\r\n\r\nThe war continues to be carried on solely in the disaffected region.\r\nThreats of transferring the seat of the contest to the loyal States have\r\nconstantly been made, and are now renewed with an energy of assertion\r\nequal to the longing desires with which the straitened rebels look upon\r\nthe fat fields and the groaning storehouses of the Northern States.\r\nTheir futile threats do indeed express their wishes or their disordered\r\nimaginations, rather than their actual intentions or their possible\r\nachievements. If they could transfer the war to Pennsylvania and Ohio,\r\nor even to Kentucky and Maryland, a new aspect would be given to the\r\ncontroversy, and different results might well be anticipated. But the\r\ntime for such enterprises on the part of the rebels, if it ever\r\nexisted, has evidently passed by, and is not likely to return. One of\r\nthe strongest indications of the ultimate result of the war has been the\r\nrigid uniformity with which the military operations have been\r\ncontinually pushed back upon the soil of the seceded States, and\r\nmaintained there in spite of all their efforts to the contrary. In all\r\ninstances, their incursions into the States mentioned, though projected\r\nupon the grandest scale and with the most hopeful results, have\r\neventually proved to be miserable failures; and if they have not always,\r\nor even in any instance, met with the severe punishment that ought to\r\nhave followed them, it was only because the attempts were too\r\npreposterous to have been anticipated by a vigilant foe, and we were too\r\nconfident in our strength to make the preparation necessary properly to\r\nrepel them. With such experience on our part, after two years of\r\nconstant efforts to invade our territories successfully met and more\r\nthan merely repelled, it would be evidence of gross inefficiency and\r\nweakness in us, to permit the enemy to gain even a temporary foothold in\r\nany one of the loyal States, or even to attempt it, without the complete\r\noverthrow and destruction of the invading force. Our manifest policy is\r\nto attack them in their own country, and to hold them there, until we\r\ncan annihilate their military power. We have successfully accomplished\r\none half this programme; but so far we have failed in the other. However\r\nhumiliating may be the admission, we are nevertheless compelled to make\r\nit. We have not yet overthrown their main armies in any decisive\r\nengagements; although we have achieved many important successes and made\r\nsome fatal encroachments on the territory of the enemy, crippling his\r\npower and cutting off his resources. From the very inception of the\r\nrebellion, its field of operations has been gradually contracting. One\r\nafter another the strongholds of the enemy have fallen into our hands,\r\nand whole regions of his territory have been over run and occupied by\r\nour forces, with every appearance of having been finally and forever\r\nlost to them. Our standards, advancing steadily, though slowly, have not\r\nreceded anywhere, except temporarily, and then only, it would seem, to\r\nmake still further advance into the very heart of the confederacy. With\r\nsome few exceptions, such as the withdrawal of the army from the\r\nPeninsula, this has been the history of the last two years; and there is\r\nnothing in the present condition of affairs which would appear to\r\nforebode a departure from this uniform progress of our arms. We may\r\ncomplain, perhaps justly, of the slowness of this process. In the ardor\r\nand impatience of our patriotism, we may demand more rapid and energetic\r\naction, claiming that our immense resources shall be used with greater\r\nvigor and concentration, and our vast armies hurled like a thunderbolt\r\nupon the enemy, to crush him with one sudden and overwhelming blow.\r\nTruly this would be a grand result--a consummation most devoutly to be\r\nwished--making short work of the bloody war which has so terribly\r\nafflicted our country. This done, there could not be any serious\r\ndifficulty in resuscitating the love of Union among the masses in the\r\nSouth, and of reëstablishing the Union on its old foundations.\r\n\r\nIt may or may not be reasonable to demand such energy and speedy success\r\nat the hands of the Government. At all events, it is natural that the\r\ncountry, having confided unlimited means to the constituted authorities,\r\nshould become impatient under the delays and difficulties of the\r\ncontest, and that inexperienced men should expect the unequal forces of\r\nthe two sections to be brought into quick and decisive conflict, with a\r\nresult accordant to the relative strength of the opposing parties. A\r\ntrue Napoleonic genius might well have accomplished this grand result\r\nwithin the two years that have already passed. But such a mighty spirit\r\nhas not yet come forth at the call of our agonized country; or if,\r\nperchance, he has made his appearance, he has certainly not been\r\nrecognized and received by the powers that be. We must, therefore, needs\r\nbe contented with the slow and gradual approach we are evidently making\r\ntoward a final solution of the bloody problem. And as, even in the\r\ngreatest misfortunes, there is often some hidden compensation for the\r\nunhappiness they produce, so in this case, perhaps we may find, in the\r\ngreat changes destined to be wrought in the condition of the Southern\r\npeople by their stubborn perseverance in the war, ground for consolation\r\nin the midst of the calamities and bereavements which every day\r\ncontinues to bring upon us. The Southern rulers and masters pride\r\nthemselves on their inveterate animosity. They glory in their own shame,\r\nand imagine themselves successful, so long as they can protract the\r\nstruggle and renew the slaughter of great battles in which they are not\r\nutterly overthrown, though thousands of innocent victims are sacrificed\r\nto their mad and wicked ambition. But in truth, with every day of\r\ncontinued war they are only the more effectually destroying themselves,\r\nespecially in that particular in which they are most anxious and\r\ndetermined to succeed. For the security of their slave property and the\r\npeaceful continuance of the institutions which sustain it, it would have\r\nbeen far better for them had they been thoroughly beaten and effectually\r\nput down at the very beginning of the war. There might then have been a\r\nchance for slavery to escape, at least for a while. Now it must be\r\nadmitted there is hardly the vestige of such a chance. It is almost\r\nalike certain that slavery has been shaken to its very foundations in\r\nevery State, whether the rebellion shall now either succeed or fail. The\r\nrebels have been wrong in all their calculations. Exactly the reverse of\r\ntheir aims and expectations will be the reward of their treason. They\r\nsought to overthrow the Government in order to perpetuate slavery; they\r\nhave only succeeded in overthrowing slavery, to the certain\r\nstrengthening and probable perpetuation of the Government they hate.\r\n\r\nThe leading rebels, occupying the seats of usurped power in their\r\nephemeral confederacy, have succeeded in arousing and sustaining a\r\nconsiderable feeling of nationality and independence among the masses of\r\ntheir population. Grasping the sceptre of ill-gotten authority with\r\ngreat boldness, they have wielded it with a corresponding energy. Their\r\nearly successes and their protracted resistance, sustained for more than\r\ntwo years by means of large and formidable armies, organized,\r\ndisciplined, and led with great skill, have sufficed to give them credit\r\nand support at home, and much consideration abroad. In the midst of\r\nstirring events, carried away by the first impulse of excitement, the\r\nSouthern people have not been in a mood to calculate the consequences of\r\na long struggle. They have been elated and blinded by their apparent\r\ntriumphs; and they, whose crafty purpose all the time has been to make\r\nuse of them for the furtherance of their own ambitious projects, have\r\nbeen careful to preoccupy the minds of the people, and to conceal from\r\nthem, by the plausible pretences and superficial successes of the hour,\r\nthe certainty of ultimate discomfiture which has awaited them from the\r\nbeginning. Occasionally, it is true, there have been indications that\r\nlight was beginning to dawn on the popular mind; and in spite of the\r\ncomplete system of terror and compression which the leaders have\r\ninaugurated and sustained with the utmost determination, and with the\r\nmost relentless rigor, we have seen every now and then, in different\r\nparts of the confederacy, the vivid flashes of a still living sentiment\r\nof love for the Union. As the hopes of the conspiracy become gradually\r\nless bright, this sentiment of affection for the old and honored\r\nGovernment of our fathers will grow stronger and more outspoken, and\r\nwill not be confined to mere individual expressions. When the people\r\nbegin to open their eyes and see the strength of the rebellion rapidly\r\nwasting away, with the repetition of its fruitless endeavors; when\r\nvictories no longer compensate for the privations and horrible disasters\r\nwhich follow in their track; when, finally, they understand, as they\r\nsoon must, that the whole movement is destined to end in utter failure,\r\nand that this failure is to be only the more overwhelming the longer the\r\nunhappy contest shall be continued, a complete revulsion of feeling may\r\nwell be expected to take place. Many things in the course of the\r\nstruggle have combined to delay the advent of this inevitable change.\r\nThe progress of our arms has been extremely slow, with many checks and\r\ndefeats in those campaigns and at those points which seemed to be the\r\nmost important. If we have been successful in the West, it has not been\r\nwithout protracted efforts and immense expenditure of life and means--a\r\nlong and bloody struggle, the uncertainty of which has not tended to\r\nstrengthen us during its pendency. On the other hand, the brilliant\r\nsuccesses of the rebels on the Rappahannock and at Charleston have not\r\nbeen fully counteracted by their actual and definitive discomfiture in\r\nother quarters. When Vicksburg and Port Hudson fall, as fall they must,\r\nthe emptiness of all their triumphs will be felt and appreciated. Bull\r\nRun, twice famous, Fredericksburg, Charleston, Chancellorsville--all\r\nwill then appear in their true light as magnificent phantoms of delusive\r\nsuccess, alluring the proud victors to further fruitless efforts and\r\nbarren victories, only to overwhelm them with more tremendous ruin, in\r\nthe end which is slowly but certainly approaching.\r\n\r\nThus the continuance of the war, with its exhausting expenditures and\r\nits bloody sacrifices of life, is destined to be not altogether without\r\nits advantages in other respects besides its influence on the great\r\nquestion of slavery. It is preparing the public mind of the South for a\r\nmost vehement reaction against all the false ideas which have been the\r\nanimating spirit of the rebellion. In proportion to the greatness of the\r\nconflict, the immensity of its disasters, its delusive promises and\r\nbarren victories, will be the thoroughness of the discomfiture, the\r\ncompleteness of the overthrow, the utter disgrace of the confederate\r\ncause, and of the men who have been its authors and leading\r\nrepresentatives. It will be impossible for the Southern people to say,\r\n'We have been engaged in a noble cause; we have failed for the time\r\nbeing; but there is a future for us in which we shall surely triumph.'\r\nOn the contrary, every Southern man will feel that there is no\r\nresurrection for the bad designs which will thus have been forever\r\nprostrated. They have in them none of the elements of resuscitation.\r\nFailure in the present contest is annihilation forever. The very\r\nfoundation and active power of the fatal movement will have been swept\r\naway, while at the same time the authors and the cause alike will be\r\nstamped with eternal infamy, as having aimed at the subversion of human\r\nliberty, and only succeeded in producing ruin and devastation to the\r\nbeautiful region which they have misled and betrayed into a wicked war.\r\nThe events of the mighty conflict will live in history, but only as an\r\nexample of just punishment for a great crime, and as a solemn warning\r\nagainst the indulgence of selfish and unprincipled ambition in all\r\nfuture ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS HE SUCCESSFUL?\r\n\r\n     'Do but grasp into the thick of human life! Every one _lives_\r\n     it--to not many is it _known_; and seize it where you will, it is\r\n     interesting.'--GOETHE.\r\n\r\n     'SUCCESSFUL.--Terminating in accomplishing what is wished or\r\n     intended.'--WEBSTER'S _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nBefore evening Hiram had informed himself fully (through Hill) of the\r\ncurrent rumors about the failure of Allwise, Tenant & Co. He was glad to\r\nfind a universal sympathy prevailing in all business circles for this\r\nold and respectable house.\r\n\r\n'That's well, at any rate,' quoth Hiram to himself. 'No one will think\r\nof attacking the old gentleman, if he does secure a portion of his\r\nproperty, or, rather, nobody will suspect him of attempting it. He is\r\nbound in honor to me [oh, Hiram! _honor!_] to protect his daughter. Such\r\nwas really the agreement, that is, by implication, when we became\r\nengaged. It won't be honest if he leaves me in the lurch. He need not\r\nthink that he can do that, though. Twelve thousand dollars! Why, it will\r\nscarcely board the old folks in any decent place; and who does he think\r\nis going to marry his daughter at that rate?' * * *\r\n\r\nHiram was at the house at his usual hour. It was a lovely evening, about\r\nthe first of June, and as he walked slowly along, he caught a glimpse of\r\nEmma through the blinds. She was seated at a window, evidently watching\r\nfor his coming. He could perceive, before she knew it was he, that her\r\ncountenance was troubled. Hiram turned away his head. Evidently\r\nsomething attracted him in another direction.\r\n\r\nMr. Tenant resided in a handsome house in one of the finest squares of\r\nthe city. As Hiram mounted the steps, he paused a moment to survey the\r\nscene. The trees were in full leaf, and the odor of flowers filled with\r\ntheir fragrance the evening air.\r\n\r\n'No, he must not give this up,' he muttered.\r\n\r\nHe turned and rang the bell sharply. It was a habit of Emma to open the\r\ndoor herself when she saw him coming, but this time the servant\r\nresponded to the summons.\r\n\r\nHiram passed into the front parlor without speaking. As he approached\r\nEmma, she rose and threw herself into his arms, and burst into tears.\r\nShe did not attempt to speak, but kept sobbing as if heart-broken.\r\n\r\nHiram stood still, and, in consequence of his undecided state of mind, a\r\ngood deal embarrassed.\r\n\r\n'Why, what is the matter, Emma?' he said at length. 'Has anything\r\nhappened to your father or mother?'\r\n\r\n'You know what has happened,' she finally articulated.\r\n\r\n'Well, my dear child, is that anything to be so distressed about?'\r\n\r\n'Don't _you_ care?' she exclaimed, looking up joyfully.\r\n\r\n'To be sure I care, but only on your account, and'--\r\n\r\n'Oh, never think of me. I shall be the most light-hearted creature in\r\nthe world. I was only afraid--afraid'--\r\n\r\n'Of what, pray?'\r\n\r\n'I cannot tell. That--that--perhaps--perhaps--you would\r\nnot--that--papa's losing everything might make a difference in your\r\nfeelings. Now don't be angry. (Hiram was looking grave.) I did not\r\n_really_ think it would; but--but the bare possibility has made me so\r\nvery unhappy--so very, very unhappy!' and she began to cry again.\r\n\r\n'Come, Emma, you must not be so foolish. Sit down now with me, and let\r\nme say a few words to you; for your father will want me in a few\r\nminutes, and I shall have to be with him all the evening.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I am so glad; you will be such a comfort to him. I know you will.'\r\n\r\nHiram made no reply; both took their seats, and then he spoke.\r\n\r\n'Emma,' he said, in a tone so solemn and important that it struck terror\r\nto her soul, she knew not wherefore--'Emma, this is a momentous period\r\nof your life, and everything depends on the steps you take'--\r\n\r\n'Why, Hiram, what _do_ you mean--what _can_ you mean?'\r\n\r\n'Nothing to alarm you, but everything to impress you with the fact that\r\nno time is to be lost. Your father has made the foolish resolution to\r\ngive up all his private property to his creditors'--\r\n\r\n'So he told mamma and me. Is that not right?'\r\n\r\n'No, it is not right. It is wrong,' replied Hiram, in a harsh tone.\r\n'More than wrong--sinful--wicked, very wicked. Do you know who it is the\r\nScripture says is worse than an infidel?'\r\n\r\n'I do not,' she replied faintly.\r\n\r\nHiram intended to frighten her, and he had succeeded.\r\n\r\n'You do not! Well, it is the man who fails to provide for his own\r\nhousehold. Why, we had the text in our Sunday-school lesson only three\r\nweeks ago.'\r\n\r\nEmma sat paralyzed.\r\n\r\n'Now, Emma,' continued Hiram, 'I want you to see your mother, and tell\r\nher what I say. Tell her your father is determined to ruin the whole of\r\nyou--going to give up this very house--just think of that.'\r\n\r\n'Papa has already told us so,' said Emma in a low, timid tone; 'but he\r\nsays it is the only honorable course.'\r\n\r\n'Honorable!' exclaimed Hiram, pettishly. 'Stuff--nonsense. I tell you\r\nthat you are all crazy. You don't think what you are about. Wait till\r\nyou are turned out of doors, bag and baggage, then see how you will\r\nfeel--but then it will be too late. Do you understand?'\r\n\r\nEmma Tenant was not a brilliant girl, but she had good sense and an\r\nhonest nature. By degrees she recovered from the stupor into which\r\nHiram's onslaught threw her; she began to feel something of her lover's\r\npurpose, and appreciate something of the position he might soon assume.\r\nLoving and trustful, these faint glimmerings of the truth appalled her.\r\nShe did not cry any more. She became pale. She breathed short and quick.\r\n\r\n'Hiram,' she gasped, 'you mean something--I fear you mean something.\r\nPapa knows best what is honest, better than you--a young man. To lose\r\nour property would make me unhappy. And I thought--yes, I conceived--oh,\r\nHiram--tell me--_am_ I going to lose you?' she cried, interrupting\r\nherself. 'If it be so, say it--say it now. Do not keep me in suspense.'\r\n\r\n'Why, Emma, how nervous you are! Ah, here comes your father. I see you\r\nare waiting for me. I am quite ready, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Good. Emma, can you spare him for one evening? You will soon have him\r\nall to yourself--eh?' and, with a pleasant tap on her cheek, Mr. Tenant\r\nturned and left the room.\r\n\r\nHiram followed without saying a word.\r\n\r\nEmma sat by herself an hour--at least an hour. The servant came in to\r\nlight the gas, but she would not permit it. I won't attempt to describe\r\nher thoughts.\r\n\r\nAt length she rose, and took her way to her mother's room. She told her\r\njust what had passed. Mrs. Tenant was a superior woman. Her experience\r\ntaught her, despite her good opinion of Hiram, for he had spared no\r\npains to present himself favorably, that he might prove to be merely\r\nmercenary. Yet, after all, she did not think it probable. She said all\r\nshe consistently could say to soothe her child, without absolutely\r\ndeclaring that she believed her fears to be groundless. _That_ she\r\ndared not utter. She finished by a very common and rational argument,\r\nwhich, by the way, has very little comfort in it:\r\n\r\n'I know, my darling, that you love him, but you cannot love a mean,\r\nlow-spirited creature; and if he prove to be such, let us be thankful\r\nfor your escape.'\r\n\r\nShe kissed and caressed her child--her only child. But her words were\r\npoor consolation to Emma, whose heart was devoted to this man--very\r\nmeagre consolation. Mrs. Tenant knew it; but what could she say or do\r\nmore, just then? She could only watch and stand ready to protect her\r\ndaughter's happiness, when events should decide what course she was to\r\ntake.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHiram spent the entire evening looking over accounts and papers with Mr.\r\nTenant. His manner was quiet but assiduous. Very useful he made himself.\r\nFrequently in the course of the evening he drew from that gentleman\r\nwell-merited encomiums on his clear head and methodical ideas.\r\n\r\nAs he was about leaving--it was fully twelve o'clock, and Mr. Tenant had\r\njust thanked him for the twentieth time--Hiram ventured to speak again\r\nabout his property.\r\n\r\n'Dear sir, I feel impelled to speak once more to you. Do listen to me.\r\nDo not beggar yourself, and then turn yourself out of doors. Permit me\r\nto tell you that you can save this house very easily.'\r\n\r\n'I know it, Hiram. I know it. Don't think I have forgotten Emma and you.\r\nI have thought it all over. Recollect, I don't blame you. I know it is\r\nEmma you are thinking about. But, my dear boy, I can't do it--it would\r\nnot be _honest_. I can't do it. Never mind, we shall be all the happier\r\nfor doing right--all the happier, all the happier. I will see you\r\nto-morrow. Good night. God bless you.'\r\n\r\nThey had gradually got to the door, and Hiram, echoing the good night,\r\nstepped into the street.\r\n\r\n''God bless you,' indeed,' he muttered. 'Soft words butter no parsnips.\r\n'God bless you!' What idle profanity!'\r\n\r\nHe walked slowly down the street, unconscious that a young face from a\r\nwindow of the second story watched his retreating steps--that a young\r\nheart beat painfully as he passed out of sight.\r\n\r\nA few moments later Emma's mother entered her room, and found her still\r\nat the window.\r\n\r\n'Not yet in bed?' she said tenderly. 'I thought you left me because you\r\nwere too much fatigued to sit up.' She came and put her arms about her\r\ndaughter's neck and kissed her.\r\n\r\n'My dear, I have joyful news for you. Your papa says Hiram takes just\r\nthe right view of everything--that nothing can be more satisfactory than\r\nhis whole conversation. He explained all to Hiram, and he declares he\r\nnever passed a happier evening in his life. Is not that worth coming to\r\ntell you of?'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, it is, dear mamma.'\r\n\r\n'Now you can sleep?'\r\n\r\n'Oh yes.'\r\n\r\nBut she did not sleep, though. It is not so easy to recover from a heart\r\nshock such as she had just experienced. No, she did not sleep a moment\r\nduring the night. Hiram's harsh, repulsive tone and manner haunted her.\r\nOh, _how_ they haunted her! Never before had he exhibited such traits.\r\nWhatever the future had in store for her, here was a revelation, sudden,\r\nunexpected, _true_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHonest, simple-minded Mr. Tenant! How he is chattering away to his wife,\r\nrepeating again and again his encomiums on Hiram, till she is really\r\nconvinced. Why should she not be?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Hiram has reached his lodgings. He goes through with his usual\r\ndevotions, and is soon sound asleep. From his composed manner it may\r\nreasonably be inferred that he has made up his mind just what course to\r\ntake.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Meeker!'\r\n\r\nThere was no answer.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Meeker!'\r\n\r\nThe accent was one of sudden distress and alarm. There was a short\r\npause, when the call was renewed.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Meeker!'\r\n\r\n'What is it? What is the matter? Is anything the matter?'\r\n\r\nA slight groan.\r\n\r\nMr. Meeker sprang from his bed as if he were a young man, and made haste\r\nto light a candle.\r\n\r\n'My dear, are you ill?'\r\n\r\n'I don't know. It's something strange.'\r\n\r\nMrs. Meeker's voice sounded so unnatural that her husband hurried to the\r\nother side of the bed. He found his wife helpless, unable to change her\r\nposition. Her articulation was very difficult, and her countenance\r\npresented a ghastly appearance, for one half of her appeared to be\r\ncompletely paralyzed.\r\n\r\nIt was the work of a few moments to alarm the house and despatch a\r\nmessenger for the doctor. But what could a physician avail when nature\r\nrefused longer to perform her office? The doctor could investigate, and\r\nthe result of his examination was most alarming. Voluntary action over\r\none half the frame quite suspended; what was worse, there was little or\r\nno sensation. The poor woman essayed to speak from time to time, but\r\nwith repulsive contortions, so that her words sounded like idiotic\r\nbabble. As her husband bent over her, she seized his arm with the hand\r\nstill _live_, and with distinctness said:\r\n\r\n'_Send for Hiram._'\r\n\r\nThis was in time for the mail which closed in twenty minutes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHiram rose the morning after the long session at Mr. Tenant's house,\r\ncool and refreshed by his undisturbed slumber. Arriving at his counting\r\nroom, he received, among his other correspondence, a letter, which read\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SON: Your mother has been taken alarmingly ill. Come home\r\n     at once. Your affectionate father,\r\n\r\n                                                       F. MEEKER.\r\n\r\nWhat a load off Hiram's mind by the receipt of this brief note! The idea\r\nof a fond, devoted mother, struck down by a possibly fatal illness, did\r\nnot present itself for an instant, or if it did, it was without effect\r\non him.\r\n\r\nHe breathed a deep _relieved_ respiration, while he articulated, just\r\nabove a whisper, '_How very Providential!_'\r\n\r\nThe New Haven boat left at one o'clock. Hiram spent a most active\r\nmorning. Hill was summoned, and kept on the run all the time. No\r\nexplanations, though, except \"a sudden call out of town.\" Arrangements\r\nwere made which looked to an absence prolonged into weeks. The bank was\r\nvisited with reference to what might be required, and the news of his\r\nmother's dangerous illness turned to advantage in the most effective\r\nway.\r\n\r\nAll was ready.\r\n\r\nIt was just half past twelve o'clock. Hiram sat down, and taking up a\r\ntorn piece of paper, scratched off a blurred and nearly unintelligible\r\nscrawl as follows:\r\n\r\n                                                         12-1/2 P.M.\r\n\r\n     DEAR EMMA: I have this moment received the enclosed. I leave in\r\n     fifteen minutes. Barely time to send this.\r\n\r\n                                                                  H.\r\n\r\nThis note he despatched by a messenger, and went directly on board the\r\nboat. There he found his brother, Dr. Frank, who had also been summoned\r\nby his father, although not mentioned in Mrs. Meeker's request. The\r\nbrothers shook hands. The Doctor's heart was softened by the afflictive\r\nintelligence, and Hiram felt in a very placable humor, in consequence of\r\nthe 'special interposition' that day made in his behalf. They did not\r\nconverse much, however. Hiram sat most of the time quietly in a corner\r\nof the boat, looking over various commercial papers, while Dr. Frank\r\nwalked up and down the deck, enjoying the cool breeze and the pleasant\r\nlandscape presented on either side, despite the melancholy thoughts\r\nwhich were from time to time forced on him, in view of the alarming\r\nletter he had received. But he was familiar with disease and every\r\ncorporeal malady. His nature was buoyant and sanguine. He had the\r\nconfidence of a man of true genius in his own powers, and this did not\r\npermit any very grave doubts about the result of his mother's illness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Emma Tenant received Hiram's note, she expressed but one feeling,\r\none sensation: that of earnest and profound sympathy from the bottom of\r\na heart earnest and sympathetic.\r\n\r\n'Poor Hiram,' she said to herself. 'Poor, dear Hiram. He has been\r\nobliged to leave suddenly without a word of consolation and kindness\r\nfrom me. And I was unkind to him last night. I know I was. Poor fellow;\r\nbut I will make up for it when he comes back. I will never distrust him\r\nagain. Never.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe stage reached Hampton at the usual time. The passengers had ridden\r\nall night, and now descended glum and stiff to stretch their limbs for\r\nbreakfast. A nice double wagon stood waiting. It was driven by the\r\nyounger brother.\r\n\r\n'How are you, Ned?' said the Doctor, first getting out. 'How is mother?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, very bad, Frank; very bad. Past all hope, the doctors say.'\r\n\r\n'What is it?'\r\n\r\n'Paralysis.'\r\n\r\n'Good God! you don't tell me so?'\r\n\r\nThe other nodded.\r\n\r\nAll this time Hiram stood calmly listening, but not saying a word. _He_\r\nwas greatly relieved. He felt sure that he could not return to New York\r\nfor two or three weeks, and--he was to be married in three weeks.\r\n\r\nDr. Frank was the first to enter the sick room. Though a physician,\r\naccustomed to every form of disease, he was appalled at the change in\r\nhis mother's appearance. On this, however, we will not dwell. Mrs.\r\nMeeker had been gradually sinking since the first attack. She was quite\r\nsensible, however. Dr. Frank approached the bed and kneeled down and\r\naddressed his mother tenderly.\r\n\r\nThe poor woman tried to articulate, and after many efforts, she\r\ngasped--'_Hiram_.'\r\n\r\n'He has come,' replied Dr. Frank, 'and will be with you in a moment.'\r\n\r\nThis seemed to relieve her, and the Doctor proceeded to investigate the\r\ncase as far as was necessary. There could be but one conclusion--Mrs.\r\nMeeker was soon to pass away from this world. She was beyond the reach\r\nof medical aid.\r\n\r\nDr. Frank stepped into the sitting room, and beckoned Hiram to go in.\r\nThen came a very touching scene. When the mother became conscious of the\r\npresence of her darling boy, she essayed to give exhibitions of her\r\nfeelings. It is impossible to describe these. To have him hold her\r\nlifeless hand, to endeavor to press his own with the one which was still\r\nin part vital, to pass her fingers over his face, and strive to put her\r\narm around his neck, seemed to render her perfectly happy. But her\r\nstrength was soon exhausted, and she was obliged to rest. What appeared\r\nto afflict her most was that she could not articulate with distinctness.\r\nShe evidently wished to commune with her son, but it was impossible. She\r\ndid, however, give utterance to a few words, which were perhaps an index\r\nto her thoughts:\r\n\r\n'_Good--be good--good man_,' were plainly intelligible. '_Too\r\nworldly--not_' * * * (the words were not audible). '_Treasure in\r\nheaven--in heaven._'\r\n\r\nBy which disconnected sentences one might hope, and, I think, reasonably\r\ninfer that Mrs. Meeker, in view of that eternity for which she had been\r\nso long, as she thought, preparing, suddenly saw things in a new and\r\ndifferent light, and desired effectually and lovingly, to impress the\r\nsame on her favorite child. Hiram, during the interview, behaved like a\r\nmodel son--pliant, sorrowful, devoted, affectionate. But it would make\r\nyou shudder if you could have looked into his heart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen his mother became exhausted, so as no longer to be sensible of his\r\npresence, he stole softly out of the room, and breathed long and freely,\r\nas one safely through with some difficult performance or operation.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Dr. Frank was sitting with his father. Very affecting was the\r\ninterview. The old man had at no time been ready to believe the\r\nattending physician, who could give him no hope. When 'Frank' came, _he_\r\nwould know all about it. And so he did, but his knowledge could bring no\r\ncomfort--only a confirmation of what had already been announced.\r\n\r\n'She can't recover, father. She can't recover,' and the stout man began\r\nto sob. In the presence of his parent he was again a child, and the\r\nlatter instinctively became consoler. Mr. Meeker, as we have intimated,\r\nthough old, was not infirm, and it was a curious sight to witness his\r\nefforts to comfort his boy, while he himself so much more required\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo the day passed. The next morning Dr. Frank was obliged to return to\r\nthe city, for his patients demanded his presence. He first had a\r\nconsultation with the attending physician. Nothing remained for Mrs.\r\nMeeker but wearisome days and nights till death should release her, and\r\nall that a medical man could do was to make her as comfortable as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThere was a small room adjoining the one where Mrs. Meeker lay, which\r\nHiram took possession of. It had a pleasant window looking out on the\r\ngarden, and it contained a small cot bedstead, besides a table and\r\nchairs. Here Hiram spent most of his time busily occupied. By every mail\r\nhe received letters from New York, detailing with minuteness just what\r\ntook place in his affairs from day to day. In short, his private office\r\nwas moved from New York to Hampton, and the only apparent inconvenience\r\nwas that he did business at arm's length, as they say. Daily came a\r\nletter from Hill, although Hill was not in Hiram's counting room. Daily\r\nwas an answer returned.\r\n\r\nThere was some one else who wrote Hiram just as regularly. Among the\r\nbusiness letters, written in various hands and on various kinds of\r\npaper, could always be seen a small, neatly folded sheet, having a\r\nrefined and delicate superscription. It was from Emma Tenant. She had\r\nforgotten all that was unpleasant and disagreeable in their last\r\ninterview, on receiving her lover's hurried-_looking_ scrawl, and, as if\r\nby a sudden rebound, her sympathies were roused to an extraordinary\r\ndegree for 'poor Hiram--dear Hiram,' whom she 'treated so coldly' the\r\nlast time they met. I need not say her notes were full of the most\r\ntender sympathy and condolence.\r\n\r\nThese letters bored Hiram exceedingly. The second day after reaching\r\nHampton he had written Emma another of his hastily got up epistles,\r\nwhich contained just six lines, stating that he had found his mother in\r\na dying condition, and was watching at her bedside. He did not intend to\r\nwrite again, but Emma's letters were so persistent that, despite his\r\nresolution, he did despatch two other notes, each more hasty and\r\nillegible and more distracted in tenor than the previous one. In fact\r\nthe last had no signature at all.\r\n\r\nAt length Emma was so completely carried away by Hiram's distress, that\r\nshe actually desired to proceed to Hampton, where she felt her presence\r\nwould act like a balm to his sorrowful and bruised heart. Her mother, of\r\ncourse, would permit no such indiscreet step, so that Emma had to rest\r\nsatisfied with writing long, loving letters.\r\n\r\nHiram, meantime, was not without his harmless recreations.\r\n\r\n[All the town seemed to have been informed how devoted Hiram was to his\r\nsick mother. Nobody knew, however, of the secret of the little room\r\nadjoining, and of our hero's busy hours there.]\r\n\r\nIn the cool of the afternoon he would take a walk into the village. He\r\ncalled on his old master, Benjamin Jessup, who still maintained the\r\nopposition store as against the Smiths. Jessup was the same\r\ngood-natured, jovial fellow as ever, but all token of familiarity died\r\naway when Hiram, entering his place, saluted him with the quiet air and\r\nmanner of recognized superiority--yet, as you would say, pleasantly\r\nenough. The rich New York shipping merchant inspired the country\r\nstorekeeper with awe.\r\n\r\nHiram enjoyed all this vastly, and talked amiably with Jessup about old\r\ntimes. He walked complacently over the village, stopping every few steps\r\nto have a word with his numerous acquaintances.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, as he was taking his usual walk to the village, and had\r\nnearly reached it, he met a lady whom at first he did not recognize, but\r\nwho appeared to know him from a distance.\r\n\r\nIt was Mary Jessup--now Mrs. Mary Williams--who stopped the way, and\r\nwhose face crimsoned as she approached. She had been married four or\r\nfive years--well married, as the phrase is. Her appearance had greatly\r\nimproved. Her form was finely developed. She had become stouter, and was\r\nreally more blooming than when she was a girl.\r\n\r\nI have said she blushed, but not from any sense of mortification, such\r\nas is not unfrequently experienced when one of the sex, feeling\r\nconscious that time has not dealt kindly with her, meets an old friend\r\nafter a lapse of years, and dreads the first scrutinizing gaze. On the\r\ncontrary, Mary Williams was fully sensible of her improved good looks,\r\nand this gave to her a certain self-possession of manner which prevented\r\nthe least awkwardness on her part.\r\n\r\nStill she blushed--from old recollections, doubtless, and because Hiram\r\nhad not before greeted her as a married woman.\r\n\r\n'Why, how do you do, Mr. Meeker? I am very glad to see you, even by\r\naccident. I heard of you at father's, and I think you might, for old\r\nacquaintance, sake, have stepped in to see me. Mr. Williams, too--you\r\nused to know him--would be very glad to see you.'\r\n\r\nMrs. Williams was determined to have the first word, and she took\r\nadvantage of it. She looked very handsome, and acted more and more at\r\nease as she proceeded, especially after the reference to Mr. Williams.\r\n\r\n[Women always like to allude to their husbands in presence of an old\r\nadmirer; as much as to say, 'Don't think I am without somebody to care\r\nfor and protect me;' or, 'Don't fancy I mean to forget my husband\r\nbecause I choose to be chattering with you;' or--or--or--a dozen things\r\nelse.]\r\n\r\nHiram replied in his old artful way, very seriously, and with an air of\r\nsadness (as he made allusion to his mother's situation), yet with a\r\ntouch of embarrassment (all assumed), while his voice assumed a\r\ntenderness of feeling which it would seem impossible for him to restrain\r\nin consequence of the suddenness of the meeting.\r\n\r\n'Is she indeed so ill?' asked Mrs. Williams. 'We understood she was\r\ngreatly afflicted by a stroke of paralysis, but I had no thought of\r\nimmediate danger.'\r\n\r\n'She cannot live,' replied Hiram, his lips quivering.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Mr. Meeker, do not say that. I cannot bear to hear it. You know\r\nhow attached I always was to your mother.'\r\n\r\n'Call me Hiram,' was the response. 'It will put me in mind of old\r\ntimes.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I don't know but it _is_ more natural, for I declare I have\r\nhardly set eyes on you since you left our house.'\r\n\r\nHiram sighed.\r\n\r\n'Well, I suppose I shall not see you again for another five years; so I\r\nhad best say, 'Good-by.''\r\n\r\nThey were standing at a point where a lane led off from the main street.\r\n\r\n'Which way are you going?' asked Hiram.\r\n\r\n'Just a few steps down the lane, and then home.'\r\n\r\n'Shall you be detained long?'\r\n\r\n'Only a minute. I have just to run in and leave a pattern, if you must\r\nknow.'\r\n\r\n'Then I will walk along with you, if you have no objections. I am out\r\nfor a little necessary exercise.'\r\n\r\n'Objections? why, I shall be delighted.' * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nThey sauntered down the lane to the place indicated by Mrs. Williams,\r\nwhere a sign over the door, 'Fashionable Dressmaker,' explained the\r\nfeminine nature of her errand. Leaving there, the two walked on till\r\nthey reached a spot where they used to stroll together in old times.\r\n\r\n'Now I think of it,' said Mrs. Williams, as she came out of the house\r\nand rejoined her companion, 'I forgot to ask you if you are married,\r\nbecause if you are, I need make no apology for marching you by a\r\ndressmaker's establishment.\r\n\r\n'Don't you know whether I am married or not?'\r\n\r\n'Why, how should I? I certainly think you ought to be by this time. Why\r\ndon't you marry Miss Burns, or Louise Hawkins, or Charlotte, or--or'--\r\n\r\n'Or whom?' asked Hiram.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I dare say there are ever so many more, ever so many. So you are\r\nnot married?'\r\n\r\n'Do you think I am, Mary?' * * *\r\n\r\nAs I was saying, the two sauntered on till they reached a spot that had\r\nbeen favorite ground for their sentimental strolls. Both knew well\r\nenough, when Hiram proposed to walk down the lane, where they would\r\nland, for it was in both their minds. Mrs. Williams fancied it would\r\namuse her and furnish a little variety. She was very sure of herself,\r\nand knew 'just what a flirt Hiram was.'\r\n\r\nHiram--but never mind what _he_ thought.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough the days were at their longest, it was quite dark before Mrs.\r\nWilliams reached her own door. She entered it--after a hurried 'good\r\nevening' to Hiram--flushed, excited, and with feelings generally\r\ndisturbed. Contrary to her resolution, in opposition to her judgment,\r\nand, I may say, against her will, she listened to the old familiar\r\naccents breathed in more impassioned tones than ever before, while\r\nrelieved by a gloss of sentimental sadness.\r\n\r\nWhat had she been doing, and where had the hours fled? To what was she\r\nlistening, whose arm did she hold, and whose hand ventured to enclose\r\nhers?\r\n\r\n[It was 'only in sisterly friendship.' That was Hiram's observation as\r\nhe took it.]\r\n\r\nBefore she was aware of it, twilight was disappearing in the darkness.\r\n\r\nShe started as if recovering herself, and commenced to walk hurriedly\r\ntoward home. Hiram by no means relished the pace, but he was forced to\r\nkeep up, and, as I have observed, with an abrupt 'good evening' he was\r\nsummarily dismissed.\r\n\r\nBut he had enjoyed himself exceedingly, and he walked slowly toward his\r\nhouse, recalling every little word which, as he believed, disclosed the\r\ntrue state of Mary Williams's affections. Scoundrel that he was, he gave\r\nnot a thought to what might be the consequence if he persevered in his\r\nwicked attempt to interest her. In fact, he made up his mind that it\r\nwould make the time pass less heavily while he was detained in the\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nDo not suppose the calculating wretch intended to push the 'flirtation'\r\nbeyond what he called brotherly and sisterly conduct. Not he. There\r\nmight arise some charge of criminality or wrong, which would endanger\r\nhis position, or weaken his claims to the 'kingdom.'\r\n\r\nHiram reached home and found his mother much worse. By signs and every\r\nother manifestation in her power, she had intimated her wish to see him.\r\nNow she was quite speechless.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Williams entered her house, the 'tea table' was still spread,\r\nand her husband wondering what had become of her. Her little girl\r\nshouted in a joyful tone as she came in, 'Here is mamma,' and Mr.\r\nWilliams's countenance was instantly relieved from an expression of\r\nsuspense.\r\n\r\n'Why, Mary, where have you been?'\r\n\r\nFor an instant Mrs. Williams was on the point of fabricating an answer.\r\nBut her better angel was on guard just then. The evil spell was\r\ndissolved, while she replied, with one of her pleasant laughs:\r\n\r\n'You could never guess. I met Hiram Meeker on my way to the\r\ndressmaker's. You know he is here attending on his mother. Well, we\r\nundertook to stroll over some of our old walks, and, before I knew it,\r\ntalking about old times and old scenes, it was dark. More fool I for\r\nwasting my time and keeping tea waiting.'\r\n\r\n'Why did he not come in?'\r\n\r\n'To tell you the truth, I never asked him. I was so frightened when I\r\nsaw how late it was, I hurried away home, and left him at the door to do\r\nthe same.'\r\n\r\nMary Williams was relieved. She went about the duties of her household\r\nwith a light heart. And Hiram Meeker, during his stay at Hampton, found\r\nno further opportunity for 'brotherly conferences' with her.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nMrs. Meeker died the next week.\r\n\r\nThe funeral took place on the day which had been fixed for Hiram's\r\nmarriage with Emma Tenant. After it was over, William Meeker removed\r\nwith his wife from the small house to live with his father, and we will\r\nsay here that both contributed much to make Mr. Meeker's latter days\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\nHiram did not wait an hour, but took the stage the same afternoon, while\r\nDr. Frank remained with his father over the next day.\r\n\r\nOne morning, two or three days after his return, Hiram presented himself\r\nat the house and inquired for _Mrs._ Tenant. On this occasion he was\r\ncased in a complete suit of the deepest black, with crape reaching to\r\nthe very top of his hat. He was the picture of despairing grief.\r\n\r\nIt happened that Emma was not at home, so that Mrs. Tenant was not\r\nsurprised that she should be sent for. She did not know Hiram had not\r\ninquired for her daughter. She came in with the impression that he was\r\nall that he should be; his failure to write often being thought quite\r\nexcusable under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nShe had not, however, advanced three steps into the room before\r\n_feeling_ there was something wrong.\r\n\r\nHiram, regarded in a certain light, presented a most comical, though\r\nmost lugubrious appearance. He was so completely acting a part that his\r\nvery looks and gestures, and, in short, the minutest movements of his\r\nbody, were manifestly 'got up.' One would think an automaton had been\r\nemployed and set to work to do a certain amount of mourning, and furnish\r\nthe requisite quantity of family grief.\r\n\r\nNevertheless Mrs. Tenant advanced and greeted Hiram cordially.\r\n\r\nHe put out the tips of his fingers, produced his pocket handkerchief,\r\nas if to be ready for an overflow, but uttered no word, no articulate\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nThis continued for at least five minutes, Mrs. Tenant endeavoring to say\r\nsomething the while by way of condolence.\r\n\r\n'I shall never recover from the shock,' at last he ejaculated; 'never!'\r\n\r\nHe did not look Mrs. Tenant in the face, but kept his eyes fixed on\r\nvacancy.\r\n\r\n'I am very sorry Emma is not in, but you will not have to wait long,'\r\nremarked Mrs. Tenant at last.\r\n\r\n'I do not think I shall be able to see her,' said Hiram, with a groan.\r\n\r\n'Not see her; not see Emma? Why, what do you mean?' exclaimed the\r\nmother, now fully roused.\r\n\r\n'This is no period to devote myself to things of time and sense. I feel\r\nthat all my thoughts should be centred on eternity.'\r\n\r\n[You should have seen the activity Hiram had been displaying in his\r\ncounting room since his return.]\r\n\r\nThis was enough for Mrs. Tenant. She understood him now, and determined\r\nto bring matters at once to a crisis.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Meeker,' she said, 'will you be so kind as to step with me into the\r\nlibrary a few moments?'\r\n\r\nHiram acquiesced.\r\n\r\nShe rang the bell, and said to the servant:\r\n\r\n'When Miss Tenant comes in, request her to go to my room, and wait for\r\nme there.\r\n\r\n'Now, Mr. Meeker,' she said, as soon as they were seated, 'let me ask\r\nyou a plain question: Is it your intention to break your engagement with\r\nmy daughter?'\r\n\r\n'Really, ma'am, I do not wish to speak on the subject at present,'\r\nwhispered Hiram, looking at the crape on his hat.\r\n\r\n'But you must, you _shall_ speak. Do you think you can trifle with me,\r\nsir?'\r\n\r\nHiram was silent.\r\n\r\n'SPEAK! I say. Do you intend to keep your engagement with my daughter?'\r\n\r\nThus invoked, Hiram murmured something about--'under the\r\ncircumstances'--his 'great affliction'--'change in your own\r\nfamily'--'business troubles'--'not sure of his own situation'--'perhaps\r\nit would be best not to consider it a positive engagement'--'that is,\r\nfor the present'--'after a season should'--\r\n\r\nThe street-door bell rang, and Mrs. Tenant heard not another word. Her\r\nheart scarcely beat as she listened to the footsteps of the old servant\r\nalong the hall. Agitated by a rush of tumultuous emotions, she was\r\nunable to breathe during the short parley between Emma and the domestic.\r\n\r\nAt length she heard the welcome sound of Emma's step up the staircase,\r\nand she drew a long full breath of relief. Then she started up and rang\r\nthe bell sharply, yes, furiously, and remained standing till the\r\nservant, with quickened pace, came in.\r\n\r\n'William, show Mr. Meeker the door.'\r\n\r\nHiram sprang to his feet. He did not like the general _look_ matters\r\nwere assuming.\r\n\r\n'Go,' said Mrs. Tenant, pointing to the entrance.\r\n\r\nIn less than a quarter of a minute Hiram was walking down the street.\r\n\r\n'It is over with me, anyhow,' he muttered.\r\n\r\nBut for once in his life he felt very small. 'To be turned out of doors\r\nby a woman; still, nobody will know it.' He was soon busy in his\r\ncounting room, examining one of Hill's invoices.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tenant threw herself on the sofa, and was apparently lost in\r\nthought for several minutes. Then she rose and went to her daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHICAGO (ILLINOIS) AND OTHER CANALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CORK, Ireland, _April 18, 1863_.\r\n  HON. ISAAC N. ARNOLD, M.C.,\r\n        _Chicago, Illinois_.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:\r\n\r\nHere I am in this beautiful city, in glorious old Ireland, so many of\r\nwhose gallant sons have fallen in our defence, and thousands more of\r\nwhom now fight the battles of our country. When I think of Shields, and\r\nMeagher, and Corcoran, and their brave associates, shedding their blood\r\nthat the Union may live; when I feel myself surrounded here by friends\r\nof my country, and realize how fervently all Ireland desires our\r\nsuccess, my heart swells with gratitude for this noble race, and my\r\nprayers are, that Providence would crown them with every blessing.\r\n\r\nWhen you received my promise to attend as a delegate the Chicago Canal\r\nConvention, little was it then supposed by me, that duty would call me\r\nbefore that time to Europe. So much of my promise, however, as embraced\r\nthe discussion of the question, will now be redeemed. The project of an\r\nenlarged _thorough-cut_ canal, uniting Chicago and the lakes with the\r\nIllinois river and Mississippi, has long attracted my attention. As a\r\nSenator of the United States, for many years, from a Southwestern State,\r\nthen devoted to the Union, and elected to the Senate on that question, I\r\nhave often passed near or over the contemplated route, always\r\nconcluding, that this great work should be accomplished without delay.\r\nEvery material interest of our whole country demands the construction of\r\nthis canal, and the perpetuity of the Union is closely identified with\r\nits completion. It is for the nation's benefit, and should be the\r\nnation's work. It will give new outlets to the Mississippi, through the\r\nlakes, to the ocean, and neutralize that too exclusive attraction of\r\nWestern commerce to the Gulf, which has so often menaced the integrity\r\nof the Union. We must make the access from the Mississippi, through the\r\nlakes, to the ocean, as cheap, and easy, and eventually as free from tar\r\nor toll, as to the Gulf, and the flag of disunion will never float again\r\nover an acre of the soil, or a drop of all the waters of the mighty\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that, centuries ago, the lakes and Mississippi were united,\r\nthrough the Illinois and Wisconsin rivers, and we must remove the\r\nobstructions, now divorcing their waters, and restore their union, by\r\nthorough-cut canals. In a few years, the saving of transportation, in a\r\nsingle year, would more than pay the cost of the work. The increase of\r\npopulation, wealth, products, imports, exports, and revenue, which would\r\nfollow the completion of this work, can scarcely now be estimated, and\r\nit should be accomplished if for no other reason, as a most profitable\r\ninvestment of capital for the benefit of the nation.\r\n\r\nBut, great as is the importance of these enlarged canals, uniting the\r\nIllinois and Wisconsin rivers with the lakes, other great works,\r\nconnecting with the East, are indispensable. But great as is the\r\nimportance of these are the enlarged locks of the Erie, Champlain, Black\r\nRiver, Syracuse, and Oswego, Cayuga, Seneca, Chemung, and Elmira to the\r\nPennsylvania State line, Rochester, and Alleghany River. Nearly all of\r\nthese are 70 feet wide and 7 feet deep, and require only an enlargement\r\nof the locks, whilst a few require to be widened and deepened. The\r\nChemung canal connects the Susquehanna with the Erie canal, at\r\nMontezuma, and the Chenango is nearly completed to the north branch of\r\nthe Susquehanna at the Pennsylvania State line, whence, the Susquehanna\r\ncanal passes through Wilkesbarre, Northumberland, Middleton, and\r\nWrightsville, to Havre de Grace, in Maryland, on tide water, at the\r\nhead of Chesapeake Bay. The great canal, from the southern boundary of\r\nNew York, down the Susquehanna to tide water, is now five feet deep, and\r\nfrom 40 to 50 feet wide, and can all be readily enlarged to the\r\ndimensions of the Erie canal. With these works thus enlarged, the\r\nconnection of the lakes would not only be complete with the Hudson, and\r\nby the Delaware and Raritan canal with the Delaware, and by the Delaware\r\nand Chesapeake canal with the Chesapeake Bay, but also by the direct\r\nroute, down the Susquehanna, to Baltimore, Norfolk, and Albemarle Sound.\r\nIs not this truly national, and is it not equally beneficial, to the\r\nEast and the West, to open all these routes for large steamers? The\r\nsystem, however, would not be complete, without uniting Champlain with\r\nthe St. Lawrence, Ontario with Erie, and Huron and Michigan with\r\nSuperior.\r\n\r\nThe enlarged works should also be provided through Wisconsin, Indiana,\r\nOhio, and western Pennsylvania, to the lakes, to the extent that these\r\ncanals can be made of the dimensions of the Erie, and supplied with\r\nwater. Nor should we forget the widening of the canal at Louisville, the\r\nremoval of obstructions in the St. Clair flats and upper Mississippi,\r\nand the deepening of the mouth of this great river. The construction of\r\nthese works would be costly, but as a mere investment of capital, for\r\nthe increase of our wealth and revenue, they would pay the nation\r\ntenfold.\r\n\r\nAs the main object of these works is cheap transportation, the tolls\r\nshould be diminished, as the works were completed, to the full extent\r\nthat freight could be carried more cheaply in large boats, and provision\r\nshould be made for an adequate sinking fund, so as gradually to\r\nliquidate the whole cost, and then to collect no more toll than would\r\npay to keep the works in repair. Such is the true interest of the States\r\nand of the nation. If New York could collect a toll for navigating the\r\nHudson, it would be against her interest, for the diminution and\r\ndiversion of business, and tax on labor and products, would far exceed\r\nthe net proceeds of any such toll. The same principle will apply to\r\nthese canals. As some of them, unfortunately, are owned by private\r\ncompanies, adequate provision should be made, to prevent these aids from\r\nbeing perverted to purposes of individual speculation. The Erie and\r\nOntario canal, at the falls of Niagara, and the Superior, Huron, and\r\nMichigan canal (less than a mile long), at the falls of St. Mary, should\r\nbe made ship canals, much larger than those of Canada.\r\n\r\nThe cost of all these works may exceed $100,000,000, but the admirable\r\nfinancial system of Mr. Secretary Chase, would soon supply abundant\r\nmeans for their construction. Already the price of gold has fallen\r\nlargely, our legal tenders are being funded, by millions, in the\r\nSecretary's favorite 5-20 sixes, and we shall soon have, under his\r\nsystem, a sound, uniform national currency, binding every State and\r\ncitizen to the Union, and fraught ultimately with advantages to the\r\nnation, equal to the whole expense of the war.\r\n\r\nIn passing down the Susquehanna canal, at Middletown, commences the\r\ncanal which, by way of Reading and the Schuylkill, connects Philadelphia\r\nwith the Susquehanna and the lakes. Most of this work is already six\r\nfeet deep, but the whole route, if practicable, should be enlarged to\r\nthe dimensions of the Erie canal.\r\n\r\nI have met in the British Museum some documents showing the original\r\nproject (absurdly abandoned) for a large canal from the Schuylkill to\r\nthe Susquehanna. A slight change will restore this work, and give to\r\nPhiladelphia a complete seven-foot canal, via the Schuylkill and\r\nSusquehanna to the lakes, as short as from New York, and through a\r\nricher country, both mineral and agricultural. It appears that\r\nWashington and Franklin both favored this route.\r\n\r\n1. Gunboats, and large commercial steamers, could then pass, without\r\ninterruption, through all the lakes, to the St. Lawrence, the Hudson,\r\nthe Delaware, Susquehanna, Chesapeake Bay, Albemarle Sound, the Ohio,\r\nand Mississippi.\r\n\r\n2. In case of war, foreign or domestic, the saving to the Government in\r\nprices of articles they must buy, and in transportation of men,\r\nmunitions of war, supplies, and coal, would be enormous. It is believed\r\nthat the excess of cost in prices and transportation during this\r\nrebellion, occasioned by the want of these works, WOULD MORE THAN PAY\r\nFOR THEIR CONSTRUCTION. Nor is this the only loss, but victories no\r\ndoubt have often been turned into defeats, for the want of proper\r\nfacilities for the movement of gunboats, of supplies, and munitions, and\r\nthe rapid concentration of troops and reënforcements.\r\n\r\n3. The ability to obtain supplies, and coals, and vessels, from so many\r\npoints, and especially gunboats, where the coal, iron, and fluxes are in\r\njustaposition, would hasten construction, and cheapen prices to the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe enormous naval and military power, gained by such works, would tend\r\ngreatly to prevent wars, foreign or domestic; or, if they did occur,\r\nwould enable us to conduct them with more economy and success. It is\r\nsaid such vessels can be built on the lakes, and so they can, for lake\r\ndefence, but they would be liable to capture or destruction there,\r\nbefore completed, by the enemy, and iron vessels, and iron-clads, could\r\nnot be constructed so cheaply, where there is neither coal nor iron, as\r\nin regions like the Delaware, Susquehanna, Alleghany, and Ohio, where\r\nthese great articles abound, and can be used on the spot, with so much\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, also, that, if these iron steamers and iron-clads\r\nare constructed on the seaboard or the lakes, still, the iron and coal\r\nfor building them, and the coal for running them, could be supplied much\r\nmore cheaply, if these enlarged canals were finished. Besides, events\r\nare now occurring, and may again, in our history, requiring the\r\nimmediate construction of hundreds of iron vessels, rams, iron-clads,\r\nand mortar boats, calling for all the works on the seaboard, the lakes,\r\nthe Western rivers, and enlarged canals, to furnish, in time, the\r\nrequisite number. Rapid concentration of forces, naval and military, and\r\nprompt movements, are among the greatest elements of success in war. It\r\nwill be conceded, that the ability to run gunboats, iron-clads, rams,\r\nand mortar boats, through all our lakes, to and from them to all our\r\ngreat rivers, and to connect from both, through such enlarged canals,\r\nwith the seaboard, and the Gulf, would vastly increase our naval and\r\nmilitary power.\r\n\r\nIs it not clear, then, that if such a movement, with such resources and\r\ncommunications, had been made, in sufficient force, the first year of\r\nthe war, so as to seize, or effectully blockade, all the rebel ports, to\r\noccupy, by an upward and downward movement, the whole Mississippi and\r\nall its tributaries, isolating and cutting rebeldom in two, and thus\r\npreventing supplies from Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, that the\r\ncontest must have been closed long ere this, and thus saved five or six\r\ntimes the cost of these works. As indicating the consequence of our\r\noccupation and command of the Mississippi and the Gulf, let us see its\r\neffect on the supply of the single indispensable article of _beef_ to\r\nthe rebel army and people.\r\n\r\nBy the census of 1860, table 36, the number of cattle that year in the\r\nloyal States was 7,674,000; in Texas alone, 2,733,267; in Louisiana,\r\n329,855; and in Arkansas, 318,355;--in those parts of the rebel States\r\neast of the Mississippi, not commanded by our troops and gunboats,\r\n2,558,000, and in the parts of those States thus commanded by us,\r\n1,087,000. Thus it will be seen, that the cattle in Texas alone (whence\r\nthe rebels, heretofore, have derived their main supplies), raised on\r\ntheir boundless prairies, and rich perennial grass, have largely\r\nexceeded all the cattle in those parts of the rebel States east of the\r\nMississippi, commanded by them. But that commanded by us, of the\r\nMississippi and its tributaries, and the Gulf, as is now the case, cuts\r\noff the above supplies from Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, west and north\r\nMississippi, north Alabama, and west and middle Tennessee. Hence the\r\ncries of starvation from the South; hence, mainly, the rise there in the\r\nprice of beef, from a few cents to a dollar a pound. Controlled, as the\r\nGulf and Mississippi and its tributaries now are by us, so as to prevent\r\nany Western supplies of beef, and the desolation and inundation which\r\nhave swept over so much of the rest of rebeldom since 1860, their army\r\nand people cannot be supplied with beef throughout this year. Nor would\r\nrunning the blockade help them in this respect, for Europe has no\r\nsupplies of beef to spare, requiring large amounts from us every year.\r\nThe revolt, then, is doomed this year by starvation, if not, as we\r\nbelieve, by victories. Indeed, I imagine, if our Secretaries of War and\r\nof the Navy were called on for official reports, they could clearly\r\nshow, that with ample appropriations in July, 1861, and all these works\r\n_then_ completed, they could have crushed the revolt in the fall of 1861\r\nand winter of 1862. All, then, that has been expended since of blood and\r\ntreasure, and all the risks to which the Union may have been exposed,\r\nresult from the want of these works. Surely, these are momentous\r\nconsiderations, appealing, with irresistible force, to the heart and\r\njudgment of every true American statesman, and patriot.\r\n\r\nGreat, however, as are the advantages in war to be derived from the\r\nconstruction of these works, it is still more in peace, and as arteries\r\nof trade, that the benefit would be greatest. If iron steamers are to\r\ncontrol the commerce of the world, the cheap construction and running of\r\nsuch vessels may decide this great question in our favor. Now, whether\r\nthese steamers are to be built on the seaboard or interior, the coal,\r\nand iron, and timber, with which to make them, and the coal and supplies\r\nwith which to run them, could be furnished much more cheaply by these\r\nenlarged canals. And even if the vessels be of timber, the engines,\r\nboilers, anchors, &c., must be of iron, and they must be run with coal,\r\nall which would be furnished cheaper at our lakes and seaboard, by these\r\nenlarged canals. Nor is it only for the construction of engines and\r\nboilers for steamers, or coal to run them, that these works would be\r\nimportant, but the cheapening of transportation of coal, iron, timber,\r\nand supplies would be greatly beneficial in all industrial pursuits. It\r\nis, however, in cheapening the transportation of our immense\r\nagricultural products to the East, South, seaboard, and the return\r\ncargoes, that these works would confer the greatest benefits. The value\r\nof the freight transported on these canals, last year, was over\r\n$500,000,000; but, when all should be enlarged, as herein proposed, the\r\nvalue of their freight, in a few years, would exceed SEVERAL BILLIONS OF\r\nDOLLARS. They would draw from a vastly extended area, from augmented\r\npopulation and products, and with greater celerity and economy of\r\nmovements, from the increased distances that freight could be carried,\r\nand additional articles. With these improvements, millions of bales of\r\ncotton would be carried annually on these enlarged canals. All of\r\nMissouri, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Kansas, and the Northwestern\r\nTerritories, up the Missouri and its tributaries, with large portions of\r\nTennessee, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, and even of Texas, on the Red\r\nriver, would be added to the region from which supplies would be sent,\r\nand return cargoes proceed by these works. Our exports abroad would\r\nsoon reach a BILLION of dollars, of which at least one third would\r\nconsist of breadstuffs and provisions. Corn was consumed, last year, in\r\nsome of the Western States, as fuel, in consequence of high freights.\r\nBut this could never recur with these enlarged canals. Indeed, the\r\nproducts to be carried on these canals would include the whole valley of\r\nthe lakes, the Ohio, Mississippi, and Missouri; and many articles, thus\r\nreaching there, thence be carried, on our great imperial railway, to the\r\nPacific, bringing back return cargoes for the same routes. Breadstuffs\r\nand provisions and cotton would be carried more cheaply through these\r\ncanals to the manufacturing States, and their fabrics return, the same\r\nway, in vastly augmented amounts, to the West.\r\n\r\nLast year, even during a war, breadstuffs and provisions, reaching\r\n$109,676,875 in value, were exported abroad, from the loyal States\r\nalone; but, with these enlarged canals, the amount could be more than\r\ntripled, the augmented exports bringing in increased imports, and vast\r\nadditional revenue. Can we not realize the certainty of these great\r\nresults, and have we not the energy and patriotism to insure their\r\naccomplishment? Assuredly we have.\r\n\r\nNor is it only our revenue from duties that would be increased to an\r\nextent sufficient of itself, in a few years, to pay the principal and\r\ninterest of the debt incurred in the construction of these works, but\r\nour internal revenue, also, would be prodigiously augmented.\r\n\r\nThe census of 1860 shows our increase of wealth, from 1850 to 1860, to\r\nhave been 126.45 per cent. (Table 35). Now, if we would increase our\r\nwealth only one tenth, in the next ten years, by the construction of\r\nthese works, then (our wealth being now $16,159,616,068) such increase\r\nwould make our wealth, in 1870, instead of $36,593,450,585, more than\r\nsixteen hundred millions _greater_, or more than _ten times_ the cost of\r\nthese works; and, in 1880, instead of $82,865,868,849, over three\r\nbillions six hundred millions more, or more than twenty times the cost\r\nof those works. The same percentage, then, of our present internal tax,\r\non this augmented wealth, estimated at only one per cent., would be\r\n$16,000,000 (annually) in 1870, and $36,000,000 (annually) in 1880, and\r\nconstantly increasing. Add this to the great increase of our revenue\r\nfrom duties, as the result of these works, and the addition would not\r\nonly soon liquidate their cost, but yield a sum which, in a few years,\r\nwould pay the principal and interest of our public debt.\r\n\r\nWith such works, we would certainly soon be the first military, naval,\r\nand commercial power of the world. The West, with these reduced\r\nfreights, would secure immense additional markets for her products, and\r\nthe East send a much larger amount of manufactures, in return cargoes,\r\nto the West.\r\n\r\nA new and great impulse would be given to the coal and iron interest. If\r\nthe Delaware, Susquehanna, and their tributaries, and the Ohio and its\r\ntributaries, especially the Youghiogheny, Monongahela, and Alleghany had\r\nthe benefit of low freight, afforded by these canals, they could supply\r\nnot only the seaboard at reduced rates, but also central and western New\r\nYork, the Canadas, and the whole lake region, with coal and iron.\r\nIndeed, the increased demand, thus caused for these great articles,\r\nwould soon bring our make of iron, and consumption of coal, up to that\r\nof England, and ultimately much larger. Freight is a much greater\r\nelement in the cost of coal and iron, than of agricultural products, but\r\nthe increased exchange would be mutually advantageous.\r\n\r\nWith this system completed, the Mississippi might communicate by large\r\nsteamers with all the lakes, and eastward, by the enlarged canals, to\r\nChicago or Green Bay, or pass up the Ohio, by the Wabash or from\r\nLawrenceburg or Cincinnati to Toledo, or by Portsmouth or Bridgeport to\r\nCleveland or by Bridgeport to Erie city, or by Pittsburg, up the\r\nAlleghany, to Olean and Rochester, on the Erie canal, or by ship canal,\r\nfrom Buffalo to Ontario, thence, by the St. Lawrence, to Lake Champlain\r\nand the Hudson, or by Oswego to Syracuse, or by the Erie canal from\r\nBuffalo to the Hudson, or by the Chenango or Chemung route, down the\r\nSusquehanna, to Philadelphia, or Baltimore, or down the Chesapeake to\r\nNorfolk, and on through Albemarle Sound south. Or, going from the East,\r\nor South, westward by these routes, the steamer could proceed west, and\r\nup the Missouri, to the points where they would meet the great railway\r\nleading to the Pacific. Indeed, if we do our duty now, the next\r\ngeneration may carry similar canals from the head of Lake Superior to\r\nthe Mississippi and Missouri, and up the Kansas or Platte to the gold\r\nmines of Colorado, or, from the great falls of the Missouri, to the base\r\nof the Rocky mountains, with railroad connection thence to the mouth of\r\nthe Oregon and Puget's sound. There would be connected with this system,\r\nthe lakes, and all the Eastern waters, the Ohio and all its tributaries,\r\nincluding the Youghiogheny, Monongahela, Alleghany, Kanawa, Guyandotte,\r\nBig Sandy, Muskingum, Scioto, Miami, Wabash, Licking, Kentucky, Green\r\nriver, Barren, Cumberland, and Tennessee, the upper Mississippi and its\r\ntributaries, especially the Illinois and Wisconsin, the Desmoines and\r\nSt. Peter's, the lower Mississippi and all its vast tributaries, the St.\r\nFrancis, White river, Arkansas, Red river, and Yazoo. These are no\r\ndreams of an enthusiast, but advancing realities, if _now_, _now_ we\r\nwill only do our duty in crushing this rebellion, and exorcise the foul\r\nfiend of slavery, that called it into being. We may best judge of what\r\nwe may do in the future, by what we have done in the past. We have\r\nconstructed 4,650 miles of canals (including slackwater), at a cost of\r\n$132,000,000. We have constructed (including city roads) 31,898 miles of\r\nrailroad, at a cost of $1,203,285,569, making an aggregate, for\r\nrailroads and canals, of $1,335,285,569. Now, one tenth of this sum will\r\nprobably make all the works proposed now to be executed, for they are\r\nall only enlargements of existing canals, except the ship canal round\r\nthe falls of Niagara, and a similar canal from Lake Champlain to the St.\r\nLawrence, a work of vast importance, but that can only be accomplished\r\nwith the aid and consent of Canada, and is not now estimated.\r\n\r\nThese improvements would be truly national, especially as provision\r\nwould be made for deepening the mouth of the Mississippi. We propose to\r\nmake or enlarge no mere local works, but only such as connect the\r\nAtlantic and the Gulf with the lakes, Ohio, Mississippi, Missouri,\r\nHudson, Delaware, Susquehanna, Chesapeake bay, and Albemarle sound.\r\nThere local routes must be constructed or enlarged by local or State\r\nexpenditures.\r\n\r\nThe canals in New York, constituting so large a portion of the system,\r\nhave already (mostly) the requisite width and depth, and only need an\r\nenlargement of the locks. The great Delaware and Raritan canal,\r\nconnecting New York with Philadelphia, has a depth of 8 feet, and the\r\nDelaware and Chesapeake, uniting them with the Susquehanna and the\r\nlakes, Baltimore, Norfolk, and Albemarle sound, has a depth of ten feet.\r\nNo doubt the enlightened proprietors of the Delaware and Raritan canal\r\nwould, on fair terms to themselves and the Government, enlarge that\r\ncanal (if practicable) to the depth of the Delaware and Chesapeake,\r\nwhich would be of incalculable benefit to the whole country, but\r\nespecially to New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Norfolk.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania canals proposed to be enlarged are the Schuylkill,\r\nleading by the Union from Philadelphia, through Reading to Middleton on\r\nthe Susquehanna, and thence up that river to the Erie and the lakes. The\r\nSchuylkill canal, 70 miles to Reading, has a depth of 6 feet, and from\r\nReading to Middleton, 4 feet. The Susquehanna canal, from Havre de\r\nGrace, Maryland, at the head of tidewater, and the Chesapeake bay to the\r\nNew York line, and system, has a uniform depth of 5 feet, and is about\r\n300 miles long. This canal, leading through Maryland and Pennsylvania\r\nalong the Susquehanna, can readily and cheaply be enlarged to the\r\ndimensions of the Erie canal, and will then furnish Norfolk, Baltimore,\r\nand Philadelphia a direct route to the lakes by the enlarged system,\r\nfully equal to that of New York. Western Pennsylvania and Pittsburg\r\nwould have the route, by the enlarged system, up the Alleghany and Olean\r\nto Rochester on the Erie canal, and thence to the Hudson or the lakes,\r\nand from Bridgeport to Cleveland or Erie city. Ohio would have the\r\nbenefit of the routes (enlarged) to and from Cleveland to Bridgeport or\r\nPortsmouth on the Ohio, and to and from Toledo to the mouth of the\r\nWabash or Miami or to Cincinnati. These canals are 40 feet wide and 4\r\nfeet deep. Indiana would have the benefit of the Wabash and Erie canal\r\nto Evansville, on the Ohio, from Toledo, and to and from the same point\r\nto the mouth of the Miami at Lawrenceburg and to Cincinnati, and would\r\nalso largely participate in the benefit of the Chicago and Illinois\r\ncanal of the whole system. Wisconsin would have the benefit of all these\r\ncanals, but especially of that connecting the Wisconsin river with Green\r\nBay, and the rest of the lakes with Lake Superior. Illinois would have\r\nthe benefit of the Wabash and Erie, the Chicago and Illinois, and of the\r\nentire system. Indeed, with a thorough-cut canal from the Illinois river\r\nto Chicago, fact will outstrip fancy as regards the progress of that\r\ngreat city. And here a strong argument in favor of the whole of these\r\nworks is presented to every true American, by the fact that the vast and\r\nincreasing heavy and bulky products of the West demand the enlarged\r\nworks, and if she cannot have them by the Hudson, the Delaware, and\r\nSusquehanna, she will have them by the Canada canals, and the St.\r\nLawrence to its outlet in the Gulf. Minnesota would have the benefit of\r\nthe improvement of the upper Mississippi, and of the canals uniting the\r\nWisconsin with Green Bay, and Superior with the other lakes. Iowa,\r\nMissouri, Kansas, and the whole Western Territories would have the\r\nbenefit of the improvement of the Mississippi, of the routes by Chicago,\r\nGreen Bay, the Ohio, and the whole system. The glorious new free State\r\nof Western Virginia would have the benefit of all the routes up and down\r\nthe Ohio and Mississippi to the lakes, the Hudson, Delaware,\r\nSusquehanna, and the Gulf. So would Kentucky, and the enlargement of the\r\nLouisville canal would be within her own limits. When we reflect that\r\nKentucky borders for nearly a thousand miles on the Ohio and\r\nMississippi, with her streams, the Big Sandy, Licking, Kentucky, Green\r\nriver, and Barren (which last four have 766 miles of slackwater\r\nnavigation), Cumberland, and Tennessee, all tributaries of the Ohio, the\r\nbenefits to her would be prodigious. The interest of the States of\r\nTennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, North Alabama, on the\r\nTennessee river, and Texas, on the Red river, would be greatly promoted.\r\nThey would all have improved routes to and from the mouth of the\r\nMississippi, and to and from the Ohio, the lakes, and the Atlantic.\r\nEastern Virginia and North Carolina would derive great advantages by the\r\nenlarged routes, connecting Albemarle sound and the Chesapeake with New\r\nYork, Philadelphia, the Hudson, the Delaware, the Susquehanna, and the\r\nlakes. Delaware and Maryland could avail themselves most beneficially of\r\nall these routes, and Baltimore would derive immense advantages from\r\nthe enlarged route by the Susquehanna to the lakes, having then as good\r\na route there as New York, and the difference of distance being only 30\r\nmiles. New Jersey, by her route from the Delaware and Raritan to the\r\nHudson, and by her rising cities near or opposite Philadelphia and New\r\nYork, and by the enlarged system to the lakes, would find all her\r\ninterests greatly advanced, and the business on her canals and railroads\r\nvastly increased. Michigan, with a larger lake shore than any other\r\nState, fronting on Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, St. Clair, the\r\nconnecting straits and rivers, and Lake Erie, would derive immense\r\nadvantages. By her immediate connection with the whole New York and\r\nEastern system, and by Toledo, Cleveland or Erie city, to the Ohio\r\nriver, and by the Chicago or Green Bay routes to the Mississippi and the\r\nGulf, her vast agricultural products in the peninsula would find new and\r\naugmented markets; while, with the ship canal to Lake Superior, her\r\nmagnificent iron and copper mines on that immense inland sea, as well as\r\nthose in Wisconsin, and the splendid pineries and fisheries of both\r\nStates, would receive an immense development. Pennsylvania has no large\r\navailable through route now from the Delaware and Susquehanna to the\r\nlakes, nor from Pittsburg. The proposed system would give her those\r\nroutes, as well from the East as from the West. This would give to her\r\ncoal and iron, her vast agricultural products, her immense manufactures,\r\nand all her industrial pursuits a new impulse, while her two great\r\ncities, Philadelphia and Pittsburg, would be greatly advanced in wealth\r\nand population. When we reflect that coal and iron have mainly\r\ncontributed to make England what she is, and how superior, in this\r\nrespect, are the natural advantages of Pennsylvania with her bituminous\r\nand anthracite coal and iron and fluxes in juxtaposition, with a\r\n_continent_ surrounding her to furnish a market, with her central\r\nlocation, fronting on the deep tidewater of the Delaware, and upon the\r\nlakes and the Ohio, with its two great confluents at Pittsburg, the\r\nAlleghany and Monongahela, we cannot fully realize the immense\r\nadvantages which she would derive from these enlarged communications.\r\nBut what of New York? With all her routes, as well as that of the Erie\r\ncanal, enlarged as proposed, with her mighty system extending to the\r\nlakes and St. Lawrence, from Lake Champlain to Superior, south by the\r\nDelaware and Susquehanna, west by the Alleghany, Ohio, Missouri, and\r\nMississippi, and her great city with an unrivalled location, what an\r\nimperial destiny lies before her, with the Union preserved? Oh! if she\r\nwould only fully realize these great truths, and spurn from her embrace\r\nthe wretched traitors who, while falsely professing peace, mean the\r\ndegradation of the North and the dissolution of this Union, who can\r\nassign limits to her wealth and commerce?\r\n\r\nLet us now examine the relations of New England to these proposed works.\r\nVermont, upon Lake Champlain, by the enlarged system, connecting her\r\nwith the Hudson, the St. Lawrence, and the lakes, would be greatly\r\nadvanced in wealth and population. But with cheapened transportation to\r\nand from Lake Champlain or the Hudson, not only Vermont, but all New\r\nEngland, in receiving her coal and iron, and her supplies from the West,\r\nand in sending them her manufactures, will enjoy great advantages, and\r\nthe business of her railroads be vastly increased. So, also, New\r\nEngland, on the Sound, and, in fact, the whole seaboard and all its\r\ncities. Bridgeport, New Haven, New London, Providence, Fall River, New\r\nBedford, Boston, Portland, Bangor, Belfast, and Eastport will all\r\ntransact an immense increased business with New York, Philadelphia,\r\nBaltimore, and the West. As the greatest American consumer of Western\r\nbreadstuffs and provisions, and of our iron and coal, and the principal\r\nseat of domestic manufactures, the augmented reciprocal trade of New\r\nEngland with the South and West will be enormous. Her shipping and\r\nshipbuilding interests, her cotton, woollen, worsted, and textile\r\nfabrics, her machinery, engines, and agricultural implements, boots and\r\nshoes, hats and caps, her cabinet furniture, musical instruments, paper,\r\nclothing, fisheries, soap, candles, and chandlery, in which she has\r\nexcelled since the days of Franklin, and, in fact, all her industrial\r\npursuits, will be greatly benefited. The products of New England in\r\n1860, exclusive of agriculture and the earnings of commerce, were of the\r\nvalue of $494,075,498. But, in a few years after the completion of these\r\nworks, this amount will be doubled. Such is the skilled and educated\r\nindustry of New England, and such the inventive genius of her people,\r\nthat there is no limit to her products, except markets and consumers. As\r\nNew York increases, the swelling tide of the great city will flow over\r\nto a vast extent into the adjacent shores of Connecticut and New Jersey,\r\nand Hoboken, West Hoboken, Weehawken, Hudson City, Jersey City, and\r\nNewark will meet in one vast metropolis. Philadelphia will also flow\r\nover in the same way into Camden and adjacent portions of New Jersey,\r\nwhose farms already greatly exceed in value those of any other State.\r\nThe farms of New Jersey in 1860 were of the average value of $60.38 per\r\nacre, while those of South Carolina, the great leader of the rebellion,\r\nwith all her boasted cotton, rice, and tobacco, and her 402,406 slaves,\r\nwere then of the average value of $8.61 per acre. (Census Table 36.) And\r\nyet there are those in New Jersey who would drag her into the rebel\r\nconfederacy, cover her with the dismal pall of slavery, and who cry\r\n_Peace! peace!_ when there is no peace, except in crushing this wicked\r\nrebellion. The States of the Pacific, as the enlarged canals reached the\r\nMississippi and Missouri, and ultimately the base of the Rocky\r\nmountains, would be greatly advanced in all their interests.\r\nAgricultural products and other bulky and heavy articles that could not\r\nbear transportation all the way by the great Pacific railroad, could be\r\ncarried by such enlarged canals to the Mississippi and Missouri, and\r\nultimately to the base of the Rocky mountains, and thence, by railroad,\r\na comparatively short distance to the Pacific, and westward to China and\r\nJapan. In order to make New York and San Francisco great depots of\r\ninteroceanic commerce for America, Europe, Asia, and the world, these\r\nenlarged canals, navigated by large steamers, and ultimately toll free,\r\nare indispensable.\r\n\r\nWe have named, then, all the Territories, and all the thirty-five\r\nStates, except three, as deriving great and special advantages from this\r\nsystem. These three are Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida, with a\r\nwhite population, in 1860, of 843,338. These States, however, would not\r\nonly participate in the increased prosperity of the whole country, and\r\nin augmented markets for their cotton, rice, sugar, tobacco, and timber,\r\nand in cheaper supplies of Eastern manufactures, coal, iron, and Western\r\nproducts, but they would derive, also, special advantages. They have a\r\nlarge trade with New Orleans, which they would reach more cheaply by\r\ndeepening the mouth of the Mississippi. They could pass up Albemarle\r\nsound, by the interior route, to Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, or\r\nthe West, and take back return cargoes by the same route. Georgia, also,\r\nby her location on the Tennessee river, together with South Carolina,\r\nconnected with that river at Chattanooga, would derive great benefits\r\nfrom this connection with the enlarged canals and improved navigation of\r\nthe West, sending their own and receiving Western products more cheaply.\r\n\r\nThus, every State and every Territory in the Union would be advanced in\r\nall their interests by these great weeks, and lands, farms, factories,\r\ntown and city property, all be improved in value.\r\n\r\nBut there is another topic, connected with this subject, of vast\r\nimportance, particularly at this juncture, to which I must now refer. It\r\nis our public lands, the homestead bill, and immigration. On reference\r\nto an article on this subject, published by me in the November number of\r\nTHE CONTINENTAL MONTHLY, it will be found that our unsold public lands\r\nembraced 1,649,861 square miles, being 1,055,911,288 acres, extending to\r\nfifteen States and all the Territories, and exceeding half the area of\r\nthe whole Union. The area of New York, being 47,000 square miles, is\r\nless than a thirty-fifth of this public domain. England (proper), 50,922\r\nsquare miles; France, 203,736; Prussia, 107,921; and Germany, 80,620\r\nsquare miles. Our public domain, then, is more than eight times as large\r\nas France, more than fifteen times as large as Prussia, more than twenty\r\ntimes as large as Germany, more than thirty-two times as large as\r\nEngland, and larger (excluding Russia) than all Europe, containing more\r\nthan 200,000,000 of people. As England proper contained, in 1861,\r\n18,949,916 inhabitants, if our public domain were as densely settled,\r\nits population would exceed 606,000,000, and it would be 260,497,561, if\r\nnumbering as many to the square mile as Massachusetts. These lands\r\nembrace every variety of soil, products, and climate, from that of St.\r\nPetersburg to the tropics.\r\n\r\nAfter commenting on the provisions of our homestead bill, which gives to\r\nevery settler, American or European, 160 acres of this land for ten\r\ndollars (the cost of survey, etc.), I then said:\r\n\r\n     'The homestead privilege will largely increase immigration. Now,\r\n     besides the money brought here by immigrants, the Census proves\r\n     that the average annual value of the labor of Massachusetts _per\r\n     capita_ was, in 1860, $220 for each man, woman, and child,\r\n     independent of the gains of commerce--very large, but not given.\r\n     Assuming that of the immigrants at an average annual value of only\r\n     $100 each, or less than thirty-three cents a day, it would make, in\r\n     ten years, at the rate of 100,000 each year, the following\r\n     aggregate:\r\n\r\n     1st year 100,000 = $10,000,000\r\n     2d   \"   200,000 =  20,000,000\r\n     3d   \"   300,000 =  30,000,000\r\n     4th  \"   400,000 =  40,000,000\r\n     5th  \"   500,000 =  50,000,000\r\n     6th  \"   600,000 =  60,000,000\r\n     7th  \"   700,000 =  70,000,000\r\n     8th  \"   800,000 =  80,000,000\r\n     9th  \"   900,000 =  90,000,000\r\n     10th \" 1,000,000 = 100,000,000\r\n                       ------------\r\n                Total, $550,000,000\r\n\r\n     'In this table the labor of all immigrants each year is properly\r\n     added to those arriving the succeeding year, so as to make the\r\n     aggregate the last year 1,000,000. This would make the value of the\r\n     labor of this million of immigrants in ten years, $550,000,000,\r\n     independent of the annual accumulation of capital, and the labor of\r\n     the children of the immigrants (born here) after the first ten\r\n     years, which, with their descendants, would go on constantly\r\n     increasing.\r\n\r\n     'But, by the official returns (p. 14, Census), the number of alien\r\n     immigrants to the United States, from December, 1850, to December,\r\n     1860, was 2,598,216, or an annual average of 260,000.\r\n\r\n     'The effect, then, of this immigration, on the basis of the last\r\n     table, upon the increase of national wealth, was as follows:\r\n\r\n     1st year 260,000 = $26,000,000\r\n     2d   \"   520,000 =  52,000,000\r\n     3d   \"   780,000 =  78,000,000\r\n     4th  \" 1,040,000 = 104,000,000\r\n     5th  \" 1,300,000 = 130,000,000\r\n     6th  \" 1,560,000 = 156,000,000\r\n     7th  \" 1,820,000 = 182,000,000\r\n     8th  \" 2,080,000 = 208,000,000\r\n     9th  \" 2,340,000 = 234,000,000\r\n     10th \" 2,600,000 = 260,000,000\r\n                     --------------\r\n              Total, $1,430,000,000\r\n\r\n     'Thus, the value of the labor of the immigrants, from 1850 to 1860,\r\n     was $1,430,000,000, making no allowance for the accumulation of\r\n     capital, by annual reinvestment, nor for the natural increase of\r\n     this population, amounting, by the Census, in ten years, to about\r\n     twenty-four per cent. This addition to our wealth, by the labor of\r\n     the children, in the first ten years, would be small; but in the\r\n     second and each succeeding decade, when we count children, and\r\n     their descendants, it would be large and constantly augmenting. But\r\n     the Census shows that our wealth increases each ten years at the\r\n     rate of 126.45 per cent. (Census Table 35.) Now, then, take our\r\n     increase of wealth, in consequence of immigration, as before\r\n     stated, and compound it at the rate of 126.45 per cent. every ten\r\n     years, and the result is largely over $3,000,000,000 in 1870, and\r\n     over $7,000,000,000 in 1880, independent of the effect of any\r\n     immigration succeeding 1860. If these results are astonishing, we\r\n     must remember that immigration here is augmented population, and\r\n     that it is population and labor that create wealth. Capital,\r\n     indeed, is but the accumulation of labor. Immigration, then, from\r\n     1850 to 1860, added to our national products a sum more than double\r\n     our whole debt on the 1st of July last, and augmenting in a ratio\r\n     much more rapid than its increase, and thus enabling us to bear the\r\n     war expenses.'\r\n\r\nAs the homestead privilege must largely increase immigration, and add\r\nespecially to the cultivation of our soil, it will contribute vastly to\r\nincrease our population, wealth, and power, and augment our revenues\r\nfrom duties and taxes.\r\n\r\nAs this domain is extended over fifteen States and all the Territories,\r\nthe completion of these enlarged canals, embracing so large a portion of\r\nthem, would be most advantageous to all, and the inducement to\r\nimmigration would greatly increase, and immigration must soon flow in\r\nfrom Europe in an augmented volume. Indeed, when these facts are\r\ngenerally known in Europe, the desire of small renters, and of the\r\nworking classes, to own a farm, and cultivate their own lands here, must\r\nbring thousands to our shores, even during the war. But it will be\r\nmainly when the rebellion shall have been crushed, the power of the\r\nGovernment vindicated, its authority fully reëstablished, and slavery\r\nextinguished, so as to make labor honorable everywhere throughout our\r\ncountry, and freedom universal, that this immigration will surge upon\r\nour shores. When we shall have maintained the Union unbroken against\r\nforeign and domestic enemies, and proved that a republic is as powerful\r\nin war as it is benign in peace, and especially that the _people_ will\r\nrush to the ranks to crush even the most gigantic rebellion, and that\r\nthey will not only bear arms, but taxes, for such a purpose, the\r\nprophets of evil, who have so often proclaimed our Government an\r\n_organised anarchy_, will lose their power to delude the people of\r\nEurope. And when that people learn the truth, and the vast privileges\r\noffered them by the Homestead Bill, there will be an exodus from Europe\r\nto our country, unprecedented since the discovery of America. The wounds\r\ninflicted by the war will then soon be healed, and European immigrants,\r\ncultivating here their own farms, and truly loyal to this free and\r\npaternal Government, from which they will have received this precious\r\ngift of a farm for each, will take the place of the rebels, who shall\r\nhave fled the country. We have seen that the total cost of our railroads\r\nand canals, up to this date, was $1,335,285,569, and I have estimated\r\nthe probable cost of these enlarged works as not exceeding one tenth of\r\nthis sum, or $133,528,556. Let us now examine that question. We have\r\nseen that our 4,650 miles of canals cost $132,000,000, being $28,387 per\r\nmile, or less, by $8,395 per mile, than our railroads. It will be\r\nrecollected that a large number of miles of these canals have already\r\nthe requisite depth of seven feet, and width of seventy, and need only\r\nan enlargement of their locks. It appears, however, by the returns, that\r\nthe Erie canal, the Grand Junction, Champlain canal, and the Black\r\nRiver, Chemung, Chenango, and Oswego, in all 528 miles, are all seven\r\nfeet deep, and seventy feet wide, and cost $83,494 per mile, while the\r\naverage cost of _all_ our canals, varying from forty to seventy-five\r\nfeet in width, and from four to ten in depth, was $28,387 per mile.\r\nAssuming $28,000 per mile as the average cost of the canals requiring\r\nenlargement, and $83,000 that of those per mile having already the\r\nrequisite dimensions, the difference would be $55,000 per mile, as the\r\naverage cost of those needing increased dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe estimated cost, then, would stand as follows:\r\n\r\n  598 miles New York canals,\r\n  enlargement of locks        $5,980,000\r\n\r\n  Enlarging dimensions, etc.,\r\n  of 1,696 miles, at $55,000\r\n  per mile                    93,280,000\r\n                             -----------\r\n\r\n                    Total,   $99,260,000\r\n\r\nThe conjectural estimate heretofore made by me was $133,528,556, or one\r\ntenth the cost of our existing railroads and canals, and exceeding, by\r\n$1,528,556, the cost of all our present 4,650 miles of canal. Deduct\r\nthis from the above $133,528,556, leaves $34,268,556, to be applied to\r\nimproving the St. Clair flats, the Mississippi river, deepening its\r\nmouth, and for the ship canal round the Falls of Niagara.\r\n\r\nNo estimate is now presented of the cost of the canal from Lake\r\nChamplain to the St. Lawrence, because that requires the coöperation of\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nThe railroads of our country would increase their business, with our\r\naugmented wealth and population, especially in the transportation of\r\npassengers and merchandise. They would also obtain iron cheaper for\r\nrails, boilers, and engines, timber for cars, breadstuffs and provisions\r\nfor supplies, and coal or wood for their locomotives.\r\n\r\nGreat, however, as would be the effect of these works in augmenting our\r\ncommerce, wealth, and population, their results in consolidating and\r\nperpetuating our Union would be still more important. When the Ohio,\r\nMississippi, and Missouri, and all their tributaries, arterializing the\r\ngreat valley, shall be united by the proposed routes with the lakes, the\r\nSt. Lawrence, the Hudson, Delaware, Susquehanna, Chesapeake, and\r\nAlbemarle, what sacrilegious hand could be raised against such a Union?\r\nWe should have no more rebellions. We should hear no more of North,\r\nSouth, East, and West, for all would be linked together by a unity of\r\ncommerce and interests. Our Union would become a social, moral,\r\ngeographical, political, and commercial necessity, and no State would\r\nrisk by secession the benefit of participating in its commerce. We\r\nshould be a homogeneous people, and slavery would disappear before the\r\nmarch of civilization, and of free schools, free labor, free soil, free\r\nlakes, rivers, and canals. It is the absence of such a system (aided by\r\nslavery), _drawing the West and Southwest, by a supposed superior\r\nattraction, to the Gulf_, that has led the Southwest into this\r\nrebellion. But with slavery extinguished, with freedom strengthening\r\nlabor's hand, with education elevating the soul and enlightening the\r\nunderstanding, and with such communications uniting all our great lakes\r\nand rivers, East and West, all crowned with nourishing towns and mighty\r\ncities, with cultured fields and smiling harvests, exchanging their own\r\nproducts and fabrics, and those of the world, by flying cars and rushing\r\nsteamers, revolt or disunion would be impossible. Strike down every\r\nbarrier that separates the business of the North and East from that of\r\nthe South and West, and you render dissolution impossible. In commerce,\r\nwe would be a unit, drawing to us, by the irresistible attraction of\r\ninterest, intercourse, and trade, the whole valley of the lakes and St.\r\nLawrence. Whom God had united by geography, by race, by language,\r\ncommerce, and interest, political institutions could not long keep\r\nasunder. Of all foreign nations, those which would derive the greatest\r\nadvantages from such an union would be England and France, the two\r\ngovernments which a wicked pro-slavery rebellion invites to attempt our\r\ndestruction. With such a commerce, and with slavery extinguished, we\r\nwould have the Union, not as it was, but as our fathers intended it\r\nshould be, when they founded this great and free republic. We should\r\nsoon attain the highest civilization, and enjoy the greatest happiness\r\nof which our race is capable. So long as slavery existed here, and we\r\nwere divided into States cherishing, and States abhorring the\r\ninstitution, so long as free and forced labor were thus antagonized, we\r\ncould scarcely be said to have a real Union, or to exist truly as a\r\nnation. Slavery loomed up like a black mountain, dividing us. Slavery\r\nkept us always on the verge of civil war, with hostility to liberty,\r\neducation, and progress, and menacing for half a century the life of the\r\nrepublic. The question then was not, Will any measure, or any\r\nconstruction of the constitution, benefit the nation? but, Will it\r\nweaken or strengthen slavery? All that was good, or great, or national,\r\nwas opposed by slavery--science, literature, the improvement of rivers\r\nand harbors, homesteads for the West, defences and navies for the East.\r\nAmerican ocean steamers were sacrificed to foreign subsidies, and all\r\naid was refused to canals or railroads, including that to the Pacific,\r\nalthough essential to the national unity. Slavery was attempted to be\r\nforced on Kansas, first by violence and invasion, and then by fraud, and\r\nthe _forgery of a constitution_. Defeated in Kansas by the voice of the\r\npeople, slavery then took the question from the people, and promulgated\r\nits last platform in 1860, by which all the Territories, nearly equal in\r\narea to the States, were to be subjected forever _as Territories_ to\r\nslavery, although opposed by the overwhelming voice of their people.\r\nSlavery was nationalized, and freedom limited and circumscribed with the\r\nevident intent soon to strangle it in all the States, and spread forced\r\nlabor over the continent, from the North to Cape Horn. Failing in the\r\nelection, slavery then assailed the vital principle of the republic, the\r\nrule of the majority, and inaugurated the rebellion. Slavery kept\r\nperjured traitors for months in the cabinet and the two Houses of\r\nCongress, to aid in the overthrow of the Government. Then was formed a\r\nconstitution avowedly based on slavery, setting it up as an idol to be\r\nworshipped, and upon whose barbaric altars is now being poured out the\r\nsacrificial blood of freemen. But it will fail, for the curse of God and\r\nman is upon it. And when the rebellion is crushed, and slavery\r\nextinguished, we shall emerge from this contest strengthened, purified,\r\nexalted. We shall march to the step and music of a redeemed humanity,\r\nand a regenerated Union. We shall feel a new inspiration, and breathe an\r\nair in which slavery and every form of oppression must perish.\r\n\r\nStanding upon these friendly shores, in a land which abolished slavery\r\nin the twelfth century, and surrounded by a people devoted to our\r\nwelfare, looking westward, along the path of empire, across the\r\nAtlantic, to my own beloved country, these are my views of her glorious\r\ndestiny, when the twin hydras of slavery and rebellion are crushed\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nIf our Irish adopted citizens could only hear, as I now do, the\r\ncondemnation of slavery and of this revolt, by the Irish people; if they\r\ncould hear them, as I do, quote the electric words of their renowned\r\nCurran against slavery, and in favor of _universal emancipation_; if\r\nthey could listen, as they repeated the still bolder and scathing\r\ndenunciations of their great orator, O'Connell, as he trampled on the\r\ndehumanizing system of chattel slavery, they would scorn the advice of\r\nthe traitor leaders, who, under the false guise of Democracy, but in\r\nhostility to all its principles, would now lure them, by the syren cry\r\nof peace, into the destruction of the Union, which guards their rights,\r\nand protects their interests.\r\n\r\nThe convention now assembled at Chicago, can do much to inaugurate a new\r\nera of civilization, freedom, and progress, by aiding in giving to the\r\nnation these great interior routes of commerce and intercourse, in the\r\ncentre of which your great city will hold the urn, as the long-divorced\r\nwaters of the lakes and the Mississippi are again commingled, and the\r\nUnion linked together by the imperishable bonds of commerce, interest,\r\nand affection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ever-present phenomenon of revolution bears two forms. They may be\r\ndiscrete or concrete, but they are two--ideas, movement,--cause,\r\nresult--force, effect. And progressive humanity marches upon its future\r\nwith ideas for its centre, movement its right and left wings. Not a step\r\nis taken till the Great Field-Marshal has sent his orders along the\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nRevolutions go by periods. Are they possibly controlled or influenced in\r\nthese years by the stellar affinities of the north pole? Is that\r\ncapricious functionary leading up to Casseopeia, in this cycle, or\r\nAndromeda, that we find ourselves turning from great Hercules, fiery\r\nBootes, and even neglecting the shining majesty of belted, sworded\r\nOrion, to consider woman? I have not consulted the astronomers. The\r\nstars of the heavens are in their places. Male and female, the groups\r\ncome to us in winter and retire in summer: their faint splendors fall\r\ndown upon our harvest nights, and then give way to the more august\r\nretinue of the wintry solstice. The boreal pivot, whose journal is the\r\nawful, compact blue, may, for aught I know, be hobnobbing at this moment\r\nwith the most masculine of starry masculinities. But if it be, it is in\r\nlittle sympathy with the magnetic pole of human thought, whose fine\r\npoint turns unwaveringly in these days of many revolutions to woman as\r\nthe centre and leader of the grandest of them all.\r\n\r\nA great storm overtook an ancient navigator of the Ægean. He called on\r\nhis gods, he importuned them, but the waves rolled and raged the more\r\nangrily the more he prayed. 'Neptune, wilt thou not save me?' 'Go\r\nbelow,' was the uncourteous answer, and, as with a great blow struck by\r\nthe hand of the busy deity, the vessel was suddenly suspended midway\r\nbetween the surface and the depths of the waters. What a peaceful spot\r\nshe had reached! The astonished mariner looked around him in wonder more\r\nthan gratitude. 'Good deity,' said he, taking breath, 'I prayed not to\r\nbe saved thus _from_ the storm, but _in_ it. Return me to the upper\r\nworld, I beseech thee, and let me do my stroke in its battle.'\r\n\r\nStorms have swept over the ages as winds over the blue Ægean, and woman,\r\nshrinking from their blasts and the agitations that have followed them,\r\nhas prayed to her gods, and been suspended between the depths of man's\r\ndepravity and the heights of his achievements, around whose wintry peaks\r\nwinds of ambition have roared, storms of vaulting self-love have\r\ngathered, tempests of passion have contended in angry and fierce strife.\r\nTo brighten the heights they assailed each one, to clear the lofty airs\r\nembracing them. They shine now where clouds were wont to hover;\r\nsunshine steeps the rugged declivities where mists of ages hung their\r\nimpenetrable folds, paths invite where unknown, forbidding fastnesses\r\nrepelled even daring feet, and thus the stormy career of conflict is\r\nvindicated in its results. The dove testifies a certain divinity in the\r\nDoing which has produced it.\r\n\r\nBut that still region where the more timid life has nestled undaring,\r\nunadventured, shrinking from the struggle and the strife above,\r\nrecoiling from the seething foulness below--what have we in this\r\ndreamland inhabited by woman? And wherefore the earnest turning\r\nthitherward, in our day, of so many brave, so many earnest, so many sad,\r\nso many yearning, aspiring eyes? Wherefore the restlessness, wherefore\r\nthe groans of imprisonment here, wherefore the passionate longings, the\r\nresolute, deep, inextinguishable purpose of escape? Make way, O\r\npropitious gods; I can no longer be saved _from_ this struggle of life,\r\nbut _through_ it. This mariner must be brought to the surface, or the\r\nwaters will be parted before her by the conquering power in her own\r\nsoul, and she will present herself there unaided. But not in the fierce\r\nspirit of a combatant, not as a conqueror--only as one moved by divine\r\npurpose to reach and _take_ her place, to touch and accomplish her work.\r\n\r\nWhat are the qualities of this new soldier in the field of human\r\nstruggle? Whence comes and whither goes she?\r\n\r\nThese inquiries point us to the ideas of the Woman Revolution--its\r\nMovements will be deductions from them.\r\n\r\nMan knows neither woman nor her whence or whither. He acknowledges her a\r\nMystery from his earliest acquaintance with her to the present day.\r\nWhatever his conquests over the hidden and the mysterious elsewhere in\r\nnature, here is a mystery that confronts him whenever he turns\r\nhither--nay, that grows by his attempts at mastering it. The permanently\r\nmysterious is only that which exceeds us, and we study this but to learn\r\nhow widely its embracing horizon can spread as we advance. Thus the\r\nwoman of the nineteenth century is an incomparably greater mystery to\r\nman than was her sister of the ninth. Scientific conquests do but touch\r\nthe periphery of her being; they explore her nature so far as it is of\r\ncommon quality and powers with the nature of man and of the feminine\r\nanimals, and would perhaps do more wisely if they stopped dumb before\r\nwhat lies beyond and above these levels. For beyond, man reads but to\r\nmisread--studies but to vex and confuse himself, and--shall I say\r\nit?--learns to sneer at rather than to reverence what baffles his\r\ninquiries. Does this statement seem harsh? Is it doubted? See its truth.\r\nThe only science (so called) which undertakes a study of woman does not\r\ninspire its student with an increased respect for her. As a class,\r\nmedical men, above that of other men, are perhaps less chivalrous than\r\nblacksmiths. Lucky is she and lucky are they if it be not diminished\r\ninstead. For, assuming man as the standard, the corporeal functions,\r\nwhich absolutely elevate her in the scale of development, being added to\r\nall that he possesses, and constituting her corporeal womanhood, are\r\nseen by this student only as disabilities from which he is happily\r\nexempt (as if a disability could come into any life but through the door\r\nof an ability); and her larger measure of the divine attributes, faith,\r\nhope, and love--love, as compassion and as maternity--are seen as simple\r\nweaknesses to which he is happily superior.\r\n\r\nThe greatness of man's individuality lies in his power over the\r\nexternal; that of woman's is interior, central, as the sun to our\r\nplanets, which roll through common fields of space, breathe a common\r\nether, share a common light and warmth, but know not that ether, that\r\nlight, that warmth, whence theirs flows out to them. Central, potent,\r\ncommanding, superior to laws which alternately move and still their\r\ncurrents--nay, being in themselves those very laws--this hidden power is\r\nnever touched by them, is shared by them only in fixed measure, beyond\r\nwhich drafts upon it are protested as inexorably as turn the wheels of\r\nfate in producing a midge or a mastodon.\r\n\r\nThe greater includes the less, said the first Mathematician. It is no\r\nmore true of the geometer's space and the philosopher's matter than of\r\nthe physiologist's functional power. Apply the axiom to the functional\r\nquantity of the feminine and masculine, and it will be seen which\r\nincludes which, and why man, in all the pride of his highest\r\nachievements, is obliged to confess himself defeated, when, as an\r\ninvestigator, he addresses himself to the solution of the problem of\r\nwomanhood. Her individualizing attributes make in her life a kingdom of\r\nher own. Possessing every function and power which man possesses, either\r\nin identity or equivalent--the faculties, capacities, and functions\r\ncommon to both differing only comparatively in each from their degree in\r\nthe other, the masculine being confessedly the lighter side of the\r\nbalance, when the higher and finer attributes are in the scale--woman\r\nhas above them all her own unique life, which man can learn only as a\r\nstudent and spectator, the depths of which all his penetration does not\r\nenable him to explore, the secrets of which his consciousness can never\r\nreport. From and through the powers and attributes which centre herein,\r\ncome those experiences, perceptions--those faiths, hopes, trusts,\r\nyearnings, aspirations, loves, which ray out to man that purer and\r\ndivine light without which he soon stumbles and falls--that warmth\r\nwithout which his life becomes a wintry waste--that harmony without\r\nwhich he is an instrument played at will by the cunning fiend of discord\r\nand selfishness--that purity without whose sweet, cleansing current\r\nflowing over and around him he is soon mired in the sloughs of appetite,\r\nor swamped in the unclean sinks of sensualism--that steadfast holding to\r\nthings above, without which he soon drops down to grovel along the\r\nearth--that unwavering faith and that utter trust in good which keeps\r\nalive and warm in the heart of humanity its noblest ideals.\r\n\r\nThus the Cross of the feminine life embodies the idea of the revolution\r\nin its favor: revolution, which, above all its wars, national or civil,\r\nits struggles for or against freedom, above all its discoveries in the\r\nworld of matter and of force, above all its inventions, its new arts and\r\nits improved old arts, its philanthropies, its religious agitations, is\r\ndestined to command for the nineteenth century the respect of the coming\r\nages. Dion's star upon its forehead, already the dim and distant future\r\ndiaphaned in its light, comes up to cheer our waiting, wandering eyes.\r\n\r\nIt is only woman who can state woman. The unknown quantity falls not\r\nwithin the terms of any equation to which man can reduce her. Master,\r\nteacher of all other lessons in nature, here he must be the taught.\r\nLeader of all other movements, here he must be follower. Greater must\r\nnot only include, it must conduct less.\r\n\r\nWhence?\r\n\r\nOut of the peaceful, still waters below: no longer stay possible there.\r\nThe _vis vitæ_ overruling the _vis inertia_, we take up the line of\r\nmarch. Fold the napkin away from your eyes, O daughter of the ages, and\r\nbehold, there lies your road--a throng already pressing their way where\r\nyou thought you were alone. Upward, as well by the universal as by the\r\nspecial law of the case. Many a tearful eye turned backward to the land\r\nwe are leaving--land beloved by woman, though stained with oppression,\r\ndarkened by slavery, impoverished by lack of action, dwarfed in its\r\nproportions, devious in many of its loveliest lines--some of its\r\nsweetest paths leading those who set feet of innocent trust in them\r\ndown to hell at last; beloved despite all, because the heart of the\r\ntraveller is tender and loving; cherished, because her repressed soul is\r\ntimid and doubting. We have lacked light, freedom, space for action and\r\ngrowth, yet are there pleasant places there. All these are now before\r\nus. Dry your tears, O tender souls, suppress your sighs, stifle your\r\ngroans. Let us press forward in courage and hope. Forty years, it may\r\nbe, in the wilderness, but deliverance at last. The gentle cloud will be\r\nover us by day, the path of duty will shine as a fire upon us by night.\r\n\r\nFarewell, then, Africa, land of despot and victim; farewell, Asia, land\r\nof satrap and slave; farewell, Europe, land of monarch and subject:\r\nwelcome, broad, varied, exhaustless New World, spreading inviting fields\r\nbefore longing eyes that falter while they gaze.\r\n\r\nWhither?\r\n\r\nTwo thoughts naturally result from this new attitude: first, to go\r\nstraight to the kingdom already laid out and well beaten into paths by\r\nman; second, to be so polite when arrived there as to accept him, his\r\nlife, power, work, as standards to which it were wisest that we conform\r\nourselves with all expedient haste, and thus blot out as speedily as may\r\nbe the woman world--let its existence be remembered only as an evil\r\nescaped, a humiliation left behind forever. Has not its narrowness\r\nshamed us, its poverty of action cramped and starved the capacities we\r\nbegin to feel unfolding in us--has not its peace made us seem cowards\r\nwhile we lingered in it, and will not its imperishable purity bear\r\ntransplantation, and bloom in perennial beauty on the wider fields to\r\nwhich we are hastening?\r\n\r\nWe touch the borders of the promised land. Weary and spirit-sore, less\r\nfrom the travel than the bitter experiences which prompted it, we yearn\r\nfor the hospitable welcome due to a stranger, a helper arrived in due\r\nseason. We are come, O potentate. Open wide the glad gates that shall\r\nreceive us. Is not this the Canaan which we but ask to divide with\r\nthee?--a goodly land, and a prosperous, which it were joyful to go in\r\nand possess. But the heathen inhabitant thereof turns his back upon us,\r\nshuts his gates, closes his doors, ascends his throne, takes up his\r\nsceptre, and waving it before our astonished eyes, says: 'This is my own\r\nkingdom. I have created it from a wilderness to suit my own life, not\r\nanother. It cannot be shared; nobody, not you, my mother, my wife,\r\nsister, daughter--not even you, most beloved, cherished, worshipped\r\nwoman, shall divide it with me. No admittance except on business.'\r\n\r\nWhat to do in such an unexpected emergency!--such behavior, with all\r\nsorts of personal and external power to back it, to say nothing of those\r\nproverbial fractions of law, nine out of ten of which instantly convert\r\nthemselves into an adamantine cement, binding his to him, so that indeed\r\nit were a critical piece of practice to essay their sundering, for\r\n_Nature is in the union_, and she is high to be overreached, deep to be\r\nundermined, strong to be defeated, compact and wary to be foiled.\r\n\r\nSit down, then, a beggar at the border of man's realm, craving\r\npermission to enter and share it with him? Essay to conquer an entrance?\r\nAnd when once within, whether by courtesy or conquest, what then?\r\nCompetition with that stronger physique, that ruggeder life, that loves\r\nthe wrestle with external hindrances which I love not, and am inferior\r\nfor, did I love them? An equal part in that career with one who is\r\nexempt from the offices that absorb the half of my full lifetime, and\r\nrequire the best powers of every sort that I possess?\r\n\r\nSurely, here, with this body and this constitution rivalling that body\r\nand that constitution, I am doomed to an inferiority more slavish and\r\nscarcely less painful than that I have left behind. For identity of\r\ncareer, identity of powers. Nature does nothing inductively; does not\r\nfit the parts of her scheme to each other experimentally; works at the\r\ncentre, in the sublime repose of certainty, and lets facts, experiences,\r\npossibilities at the circumference take care of themselves. She has made\r\nman to dominate this kingdom which he calls his, else should I have had\r\nmy share in it from the first. Wherein she has differed me from him, she\r\nhas also differed my real kingdom from his. To stop him, I require as\r\nmuch and no more than man possesses. What is over in kind would place me\r\nin false relations with the objective; what is more in degree would\r\nimperil my subjective peace--what is less would try me by the measure\r\nanother is made for, and leave me in the shadow projected by him. Nor\r\nwould the standards which prevail here harmonize with my spiritual more\r\nhappily than the activities with my corporeal nature. Could I work for\r\noutward success only, or chiefly, subordinating aspiration to what\r\nstifles aspiration? Would riches satisfy me? Would actual power over\r\nmen, ecclesiastical, civil, or social? Could I live for ambition, and\r\nsit down unapproved of my better life to enjoy its achievements? Would\r\nthe acquisition of knowledge and its employment as a means of worldly\r\npower, distinction, and advantage satisfy the inner hunger which longs\r\nfor the truth, the light, the harmony of highest heavens? In short,\r\nwould so much of the flesh as I could gratify, so much of the world as I\r\ncould conquer, so much devil's service as I could cover up with any\r\npatched robe of decency, drawn tight, stretched to its utmost reach,\r\nsatisfy me? Truly not. Not here then is Beulah, and I must journey on.\r\n\r\nAgain, whither? This time whither my own nature leads. I have learned\r\nthis by experience, that leadership for me lies not without, but within\r\nmyself. So much is gained, and now once more for movement. Gather up the\r\neffects--all that we have brought with us out of the past: it will find\r\nuse. For woman has been woman so far as she has been anything, and the\r\naromas of that high estate have hung and still hang about her. Bear them\r\nalong. The finest effluence of her life in the first century of our era,\r\nas in this last, was love. Mary then bore the Christ; other Mary's loved\r\nhim. Woman was first in his life, and last in it. When the bearded magi\r\nadored, she loved; she was the illustrator of his teachings, the\r\nrepository of his hopes for their future realization. Bring all those\r\nmemories, visions, yearnings, trusts, faiths--dreams of the good, never\r\nyet seen but by the inner sight of the woman-soul,--along, and let us\r\nset out for Beulah. Its blooming fields and fair mountains lie dim but\r\nsweet on the distant horizon. We will go over and possess them--a\r\nkingdom of our own. Why have we waited so long in bondage and darkness?\r\nWhy submitted to the heaped-up wrongs of the ages? Patience very\r\nexcellent: once admit the idea of a scheme, and some parts must\r\nnecessarily arrive in the afternoon. Development presupposes the delay\r\nor withholding of things not yet developed. By the law of climax, these\r\nare not the unimportant parts. Woman's sovereignty has been long\r\ndeferred, because of the preparation necessary for it. A John the\r\nBaptist must precede the Christ in the wilderness. Fiends robed and\r\nsceptred, once reigned over fiends clothed in skins and armed with\r\nbroadsword and battle axe. To-day a _gentle_man, or _gentle_woman can\r\nsit secure on any throne of Christendom. While we congratulate\r\nourselves, let us not deny that the Tamerlanes, the Alarics, the\r\nNapoleons have had their share in the intermediate work of preparation.\r\n\r\nNot always, as it seems to us, do the swiftest and clearest methods find\r\nfavor with these hard-pressed worthies, but rather such methods as they\r\ncan employ; and in time, as we see, the work gets done.\r\n\r\nTake our planet in the condition in which its first proprietor found it\r\non his arrival, and you will see that the improvements would be a heavy\r\nitem in transactions with a real-estate broker for it. Liberal\r\ngovernments established--Canton, Paris, London, New York built--grain\r\nfields, mills, patent offices, world's fairs, electric telegraphs, ocean\r\nsteamers, iron-clads, Central Park, show a long road travelled, and much\r\nrough, terrible, fearful work done by the way--work which has developed\r\na condition for the exercise of the fine sovereignty of woman's pure,\r\ngentle, loving, harmonious nature--road which leads by divine intention\r\nto her empire. If the hand which has opened it has been red at times,\r\nlet us remember that no purer color could have been preserved in the\r\nThermopylæ--if the heart has been hard, that a softer one would have\r\nbeen surely defeated and we disadvantaged. Well could we afford to abide\r\nin the twilight-land when such struggle was going forward in our behalf,\r\nwhen the sunshine was descending upon such seedtime of the ages--to\r\nwhose harvest we are drawing nigh.\r\n\r\nThe sceptre of Supreme Use on the earth is to the hand that is sovereign\r\nfor that use. In its day every other power is subordinate to that, for\r\nit is the nature of sovereignty to be unitary, whether lodged in an idea\r\nor a person. It is because of this that personal sovereignty has been\r\nindispensable to human progress. Nothing could reign over the strong,\r\nundeveloped, turbulent brute life of the early and middle ages but the\r\ntremendous will and self-love of a man great according to his\r\ntime--Charlemagne, Peter of Russia, Henry of Navarre.\r\n\r\nAnd shall we complain that a development is slow which began with a\r\nSoudanese, a Papuan, and gives us now a Ruskin and an Emerson--that a\r\ncareer is tedious which opened, if you please, on Ararat, and has\r\ntrailed its waxing splendors up to the Free American States--the\r\nlibraries, the art galleries, the penetrating humanities which\r\ncharacterize the nineteenth century? For one, I cannot. Beulah has stood\r\nadjourned from Eden till now--wisely, needfully adjourned; and woman\r\nwill enter its boundaries gratefully and gracefully, as a queen waited\r\nfor and desired: grateful for the gift to the One who gave it in the\r\nGreat Distribution--graceful in the reception of a right from him whose\r\nages of struggle have made smooth her road to it.\r\n\r\nWhat will she be therein? What will her life be? I close my eyes to the\r\nActual around me, and I see her in that high land whose plains spread\r\nabove the mountain peaks that surround us here. I see a creature whom\r\nthe poets have sung, the artists have painted and chiselled, and the\r\ncommon heart of mankind has longed for, prayed for, and, in its hours of\r\nhigh communion, has trusted and believed in with the utter faith of a\r\nchild in its mother's love. I see a being whom the pure, divine\r\nImagination, the eye of God dimmed in man, has foreseen.\r\n\r\nI see her not a dream--not an airy form haunting the unreal walks of\r\nnight, to vanish when cockcrow recalls us to the cares of household\r\nlife, the fields of labor, the paths of effort. No, but an enduring,\r\nvery real, very practical embodiment of the poet's ideal, with new\r\npowers and relations illustrating its harmony in and fitness for the\r\nworld that is purified and sanctified by its presence. There to my eye\r\n\r\n  'Her shape arises:\r\n  She less guarded than ever, yet more guarded than ever;\r\n  The gross and soiled she moves among do not make her gross and soiled;\r\n  She knows the thoughts as she passes--nothing is concealed from her;\r\n  She is none the less considerate or friendly therefore;\r\n  She is the best beloved--it is without exception--she has no reason to\r\n     fear, and she does not fear;\r\n  Oaths, quarrels, hiccupped songs, proposals, smutty expressions, are idle\r\n     to her as she passes;\r\n  She is silent--she is possessed of herself--they do not offend her;\r\n  She receive them as the laws of nature receives them--she is strong;\r\n  She, too, is a law of nature--there is no law stronger than she is.'\r\n\r\nI look beneath, the ethereal drapery of qualities in which the prophetic\r\nimagination has clothed her, and central to them all I find a new\r\nphenomenon--the latest of the ages--TRUE WOMANHOOD. From this proceeds\r\nthe veiled glory hitherto seen but by poet's eye--not far hence to be\r\nfelt and known of all. For it is no longer the vision of a distant and\r\ndim land, separated from this actual present by a fathomless abyss. Out\r\nof the yawning chasm that has divided that from this there rise to-day,\r\nclear, shining, visible to open eyes, the everlasting pillars of truth,\r\nwhich will shortly bridge it and make broad the road thither, so that\r\nneither he who walks straight with exact step between the pales of\r\nscience, nor he outside wending, heedless, with wide-wandering eyes and\r\nfeet who stumbles along, shall miss it.\r\n\r\nA being planted above man, taking root where he blooms, in the pure\r\naffections, flowering in the high airs which he dreams of but sees not,\r\nor sees only in moments of inspiration from her--a being, who, more\r\ncomplex on her physical side, is therefore more affluent on her\r\nspiritual--who, from the established premises of science, demands not\r\nnew, but the very largest deductions to reach the borders of her life--a\r\nbeing whose support with the earth-life is widened and strengthened by\r\neach added organ, function, susceptibility--whose divine support is\r\nopened, established, confirmed in increased degrees over man's by each\r\nwomanly inlet to the spiritual nature--I see such a being irradiating\r\nthe future years and paths of my race, and my soul grows strong and glad\r\nat the sight. In her the self-love of man is replaced by love; ambition\r\npales its ineffectual fires in the light of that pure, undying flame of\r\naspiration which her soul feeds; patriotism, ashamed of its narrowness,\r\nunfolds shining pinions over humanity, and becomes philanthropy;\r\npleasure retreats in her wornout, patched-up harlequin robes; and\r\nhappiness, pure, clean, bright from the sweet inner chambers of the\r\nsoul, takes her place.\r\n\r\nLife acknowledges a higher fealty. With the new sovereign, new aims, new\r\nstandards, new methods for the improvement of humanity.\r\n\r\nUnder the masculine dynasty we have had force, organization,\r\ninvestigation, discovery, experiment--methods violent, harsh, selfish,\r\nslow, confused, chaotic: a magnanimous career at intervals spanning the\r\nwide weltering strife, as a bow the stormy heavens; noble deeds, not a\r\nfew, shining out of the darkness here and there; real victory crowning\r\nthe crests of the rolling sea now and then, and casting where they have\r\nshone long shadows over the waters darkened with selfish contention\r\naround them. Power under this reign has been applied to the\r\nmultiplication of external resources, means, opportunities for the race.\r\nIt has clothed the earth with them in forms so numerous, so varied--so\r\ngood, so bad, so indifferent--so noble, so mean--so rich, so poor--so\r\nhigh, so low, that the most active memory of the longest life fails to\r\nfurnish the catalogue of them. It professes human good; it cultivates\r\npersonal good, family good, community good, or, at the largest, national\r\ngood. But whatever the stature it attains, its methods are through\r\nexternal appeals to the soul--influences from without. Its common\r\ntheology steadily refused for eighteen hundred years to credit the union\r\nof the divine with the human in the soul of mankind. Its deductive\r\nintellect is blind to truth till her presence is proved by facts--as if\r\nwe would hale an archangel, with the shining light of the upper world\r\nyet flowing adown him, before the police magistrate, and swear the\r\nbutchers and the newsboys on the question of identity. Its Art is\r\ntimid, thin, and self-distrusting, because the Ideal is flouted as\r\nworthy only of women, dreamers, and liberal ministers--the silver wing\r\nof imagination is rarely loosed but to be soon folded in humiliation\r\nbefore the reproof of the exacting senses. Its statesmanship is smart,\r\ncrafty, treacherous, because it cherishes a state, a nation, rather than\r\nhumanity. Its jurisprudence is a gigantic, vigilant detective, dealing\r\nwith a population of suspects. Its physical methods only are uniformly\r\nclear, honorable, straight-forward though. Even these in times and\r\nplaces might be nobler, more open; but it fights well, labors well,\r\ncultivates well, invents well, manufactures well, because in these it is\r\ndealing chiefly between its native elements, force and matter;--but\r\nbeing characteristically inductive, it cannot deal liberally with human\r\nnature, lacking the ideal of it, the faith in it, the reverence for it\r\nwhich are the only sustaining root of such behavior toward it.\r\n\r\nUnder the new sovereignty, the methods, like the power employing them,\r\nwill have their nearest relations with the interior life. They will draw\r\nhelps from the outward; and here the glory of man as a creator of\r\nconditions and opportunities, will be first measured and fully\r\nappreciated, for it is the woman only who can penetrate his works, draw\r\nthence their full significance and value, transmute their evils to\r\ngoods, and incorporate their best spirit in humanity. It is a great\r\nthing to create that which helps any human soul to be diviner than\r\nwithout such help it would be. It is greater to develop conditions which\r\nestablish and confirm true relations between the soul and its helps. It\r\nis greatest to create the soul to be divine--with helps, or in spite of\r\nhindrances. The first is eminently the office of the masculine. The\r\nsecond is shared between it and the feminine, with a preponderance to\r\nthe latter; and the last belongs so exclusively to woman, that the day\r\nof its doing is necessarily the day of her sovereignty.\r\n\r\nThe divine, artistic, harmonious creation of the human spirit in the\r\ndivine, artistic, harmonious human body, this is the grand function of\r\nthe feminine era. For this it is that woman has those special finer\r\nendowments which in all ages have distinguished her from man, and\r\nforeshown a higher life for her in some future--some Beulah, visible to\r\neyes that could o'ershoot the bounds of the passing age. Wanting this\r\npower, preparing the day of its advent, John Baptist has toiled,\r\nsweated, groaned, fumed, devastated in his wilderness, to touch its\r\nhither border at last in this pregnant nineteenth century. Age of\r\nrevolution--age of wonders!--of which the very greatest are, I think,\r\nthe beginnings we already see of settlement here. As a question, that of\r\nwoman is not an old one. There can be no Woman Question among any people\r\ntill it is advanced enough to ask for better methods than man's. When\r\nthis stage is reached, life is ripe for the advent of woman--it appeals\r\nto her to come forward. It prepares better conditions, that it may\r\ninvite her--opens fields, that it may engage her powers--seeks to clothe\r\nher in a real dignity, of which she has before worn rather the semblance\r\nthan itself. Society, obeying the higher view of her, enacts new laws\r\nfor her enlargement, modifies or sets aside social canons which\r\nrestricted and warped and suppressed her, and begins with these\r\nmovements to find itself enriched by the presence of finer influences;\r\nled upward to more exalted standards, penetrated with a subtler humane\r\nsentiment than it before knew.\r\n\r\nYet with all these movements in her favor, woman, bone of man's bone,\r\nremains a bone of contention to him, till nature, read truly and trusted\r\nreverently, is allowed to lead him as a little child by the hand and\r\nshow him woman's real kingdom. He must not look on it with a timid or a\r\ngrudging eye. A Chinese mandarin in California, becoming acquainted\r\nwith the fact that American women could read and write and be trusted\r\nwith accounts, replied, with a warning shake of the head, 'If he readee,\r\nwritee, by and by he lickee all the men.' Does this apprehension\r\npossibly extend beyond the Celestial Empire? It will not be expressed, I\r\nknow, but there is much unexpressed feeling which is none the less real\r\nfor its silence.\r\n\r\n'Every woman is an embodied revolution, now-a-days,' said a lank,\r\ngrumbling dyspeptic, while the autumn leaves of '62 yet hung in bright\r\nprofusion on the bordering forests of the Hudson. 'If you had said every\r\nwoman is in these days an embodied revelation,' was the superb reply,\r\n'you would have done both truth and my sex more even justice.' Man must\r\nnot fear woman, for whatever nature designed for her is not only\r\ninevitable, but is his only means of salvation. He need not fear her,\r\nfor she is the daughter of nature, so full of loyalty and filial\r\ndevotion to her mother, that no wide or continued departure from her\r\ndesigns is possible. He will not fear her when he is religious enough to\r\nfeel that each natural revolution is a step in the march upward, ordered\r\nin its season as calmly and inexorably as were the secondary rocks laid\r\ndown when the primary had been prepared for receiving them, as the\r\nnebulous vapor is consolidated into a planet or sun, or the\r\nmorning-glory brought forth of its sown seed. He will be comforted, too,\r\nby remembering that natural revolution does never dethrone. It only\r\nenthrones above the present ruler. Work out your kingdom. Define and\r\nfill its bounds and metes, and never will usurper's foot print its soil.\r\nNo invasion of your sovereignty is possible. The magnetisms of the\r\nuniverse hold you there, and every other being outside--an infallible\r\npolice, bent on the protection of your rights, charged to secure them to\r\nyou without so much as a flaw in their finest edges. Nature knows your\r\nkingdom, and charges all yet unsettled parties to go aside. But in the\r\ncoming cycles she will develop others above it.\r\n\r\nThe wheel revolves. You can only remain at the summit by its standing\r\nstill. It is not your degradation, but another's glory, that is sought.\r\nOpen your eyes to the scheme: look adown its vistas of grandeur, and at\r\nevery step taken above you, you will sing, Hosanna! We also rise by your\r\nascent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES\r\n\r\n\r\nMYSTERIES OF LIFE, DEATH, AND FUTURITY. By HORACE WELBY. New York: James\r\nS. Gregory.\r\n\r\nA very suggestive book, full of manifold and curious research. The\r\nauthor, in his preface, says: 'It has been undertaken with the view of\r\nconcentrating within its focus the views and opinions of some of the\r\nleading writers of the present day, and, by placing them before the\r\nreader in a popular form and setting, adapt them for a larger class than\r\nwould be likely to consult the authorities themselves whence the\r\nsubstance of this volume has been derived. In virtue of the Scriptural\r\ncharacter of the subjects, the rewards will be a special blessing on\r\nthose who read and understand them; the interpretations and inferences,\r\nin many instances, being the deductions of men venerated for their piety\r\nand learning in ministering the most precious of all knowledge--the\r\ninestimable comfort of the hope that is in us.'\r\n\r\nThe work which the author proposed to himself has been well done. A\r\nsingle glance at the index would be sufficient to assure the reader of\r\nthe great variety of subjects embraced in these carefully selected\r\nextracts. Although from so many different sources, a unity of subject\r\ngives them unity of interest. The book contains a valuable array of the\r\nbest thoughts, impressions, and beliefs of the most distinguished minds\r\non the phenomena of life, death, and futurity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAIRY BOOK. The best Popular Fairy Stories selected and rendered\r\nanew. By the Author of 'John Halifax, Gentleman,' &c. &c. New York:\r\nHarper & Brothers, Franklin Square. 1863.\r\n\r\nThe name of Miss Mulock is sufficient guarantee that the little ones\r\nwill find abundance of entertainment, and no harmful matter in the\r\npretty 'Fairy Book' published by Harper & Brothers. The tales are well\r\nselected and well told. Bits of quaint humor are interspersed through\r\nthe narratives, increasing their interest to both old and young, and\r\nlightening the labor of the 'reader out' by many a pleasant smile.\r\nMothers cannot fail to find this judicious collection an assistance in\r\ntheir labors, and an agreeable addition to the library of their young\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS FROM ITALY AND SWITZERLAND. By FELIX MENDELSSOHN-BARTHOLDY.\r\nTranslated from the German by LADY WALLACE, with a Biographical Notice\r\nby JULIE DE MARGUERITTES. Published by Frederick Leypoldt, Philadelphia.\r\n1863. For sale by F. W. Christern, 763 Broadway, New York, and A. K.\r\nLoring, 319 Washington Street, Boston.\r\n\r\nAgain are we indebted to Mr. Leypoldt for a delightful book, a truthful\r\nrecord of feeling from the hand of a man noted for purity of life,\r\nscholarship, and an enviable reputation in the world of music. The\r\nletters are such as we should expect from the character of Mendelssohn's\r\ncompositions--pure, elegant, fanciful, flowing, serious, and dignified,\r\nbut without the passionate intensity, the soul-searching pathos and\r\nenergy characterizing spirits deeply acquainted with the bitterest\r\ngriefs incident to humanity, griefs arising either from without or\r\nwithin. Rich, handsome, and happily married, he was not exposed to the\r\nmany privations and trials generally pertaining to artist life; his\r\namiable character drew round him many friends, and his wealth enabled\r\nhim to bring out his works during his own lifetime, and thus make them\r\nknown under the most favorable auspices. He was indeed, as Goethe said\r\nof him, 'born on a lucky day.' The translation is beautifully executed,\r\nand we hope the tasteful little volume may receive a substantial welcome\r\nfrom our reading public.\r\n\r\n\r\nLILIAN. Published by Ticknor & Fields, Boston. For sale by D. Appleton &\r\nCo., New York.\r\n\r\nThis is a novel of considerable ability. The story is exciting and\r\ninteresting, the scenes varied, the descriptions vivid, and the\r\ndenouement well imagined and sustained. There are no dull pages in the\r\nbook. There is much to praise, but something also to regret. There is a\r\nwant of calm, of continuity in the style. The sentences are short and\r\nclosely cut, falling upon the ear more like the broken rattling of\r\nhailstones than the full flowing music of a strong deep river. Such a\r\nstyle, introduced at proper intervals and in appropriate positions, is\r\nfrequently very effective; but, when long continued, it grows wearisome\r\nand monotonous. As our late writers are much given to it, they should be\r\non their guard lest it become a _national_ characteristic.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUT-DOOR PAPERS. By THOMAS WENTWORTH HIGGINSON. Boston: Ticknor &\r\nFields. For sale by D. Appleton & Co., New York.\r\n\r\nThe articles contained in this book are: Saints and their Bodies;\r\nPhysical Courage; A Letter to a Dyspeptic; The Murder of the Innocents;\r\nBarbarism and Civilization; Gymnastics; A New Counterblast; The Health\r\nof Our Girls; April Days; My Out-Door Study; Water Lilies; The Life of\r\nBirds; The Procession of the Flowers; Snow.\r\n\r\nThis work was received by us too late to give it, in our July number,\r\nthat meed of attention and praise so justly its due. Fortunately it\r\nrequires no words from us to introduce it to notice; some of its\r\narticles, having been already published in the _Atlantic Monthly_, are\r\nalready known to and valued by some of the highest minds among us. The\r\nbook is written by an ardent admirer but close observer of nature, and\r\nis full of tender traceries, of rainbow-hued fancies, and marked by the\r\nkeen insight of a glowing and far-reaching imagination. The chapter on\r\n'Snow' is one of the most exquisite things ever written, pure, chaste,\r\nand delicately cut as the starry crystals it so lovingly commemorates.\r\nNor is the 'Procession of the Flowers' less admirable. In all their\r\nsimple loveliness they rise from earth, and bloom before us as we read.\r\nWriters of such high finish, such delicate perceptions of beauty as T.\r\nW. Higginson, are seldom characterized by great originality--his\r\nexpletives and imagery are as original as tender and beautiful. His\r\nillustrations are never morbid, but ever strong and healthful. If he be,\r\nas we have been informed he is, the Colonel Higginson now acting in the\r\nservice of his country, Heaven preserve the life of the patriot, poet,\r\nand scholar--for such men are jewels in our national crown of glory!\r\n\r\nMr. Higginson says: 'If, in the simple process of writing, one could\r\nphysically impart to his page the fragrance of this spray of azalea\r\nbeside me, what a wonder it would seem!--and yet one ought to be able,\r\nby the mere use of language, to supply to every reader the total of that\r\nwhite, honeyed, trailing sweetness which summer insects haunt and the\r\nSpirit of the Universe loves. The defect is not in language, but in men.\r\nThere is no conceivable beauty of blossom so beautiful as words--none so\r\ngraceful, none so perfumed. It is possible to dream of combinations of\r\nsyllables so delicious that all the dawning and decay of summer cannot\r\nrival their perfection, nor winter's stainless white and azure match\r\ntheir purity and their charm. To write them, were it possible, would be\r\nto take rank with nature; nor is there any other method, even by music,\r\nfor human art to reach so high.'\r\n\r\nTo this very height of human art has Mr. Higginson, in the article from\r\nwhich the above is a quotation, himself attained!\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE TROPICS. By a Settler in Santo Domingo. With an Introductory\r\nNotice by RICHARD B. KIMBALL, Author of 'St. Leger,' 'Undercurrents,'\r\n&c. Carleton, publisher. 1863.\r\n\r\nA 'Settler in Santo Domingo' has given us a good book--a fresh,\r\nwholesome, and evidently truthful narrative of his every-day experience\r\nin the tropics. It is a book eminently _sui generis_, reminding one of\r\nRobinson Crusoe or Dana's 'Two Years before the Mast.' There is a gentle\r\nearnestness, a mild yet positive concentration of purpose about it, that\r\nenlists our sympathies from the start. The young farmer's mind is on his\r\nwork. We suspect he has capacities outside of his cornfield and yuca\r\npatch, but to this point in the record before us he gives no clue. He is\r\na farmer, and nothing else. The bright-winged birds flit and gleam and\r\ntwitter in the evergreen woods about him, but his hand is on the plough\r\nand his ear drinks in only the music of his panting team. From his\r\nwindow, looking eastward, he sees the advance beams of the sun flung\r\nacross the savanna: he takes the hint, and hurries out to look after his\r\nyoung plantains. At night the sea keeps up its everlasting chant by the\r\nside of his _palenca_, and the pure stars watch over his humble roof;\r\nyet, unconscious of both, he sleeps on the calm deep sleep appointed as\r\nthe best recompense of honest toil.\r\n\r\nThe author of 'In the Tropics' is a young man born and reared on a farm\r\nin the interior of the State of New York, who was afterward condemned to\r\nwhat seemed to him the perpetual servitude of a clerk's life in the\r\ncity. Weary and heart-sick he yearns for a better existence. Not little\r\nNell beseeching her grandfather to leave the dark rooms and melancholy\r\nhouses of her abhorrence, and go out into the open country and sleep in\r\nfields and under trees and have the sun and wind upon their faces, has a\r\nmore intense loathing of the dull, artificial routine of town life than\r\nhe. His escape is easily managed, and his transition to the cheerful\r\nfreedom of a widely different career is so speedy and so satisfying that\r\nhe is in no mood to dwell upon the monotonous past. We get an estimate\r\nof the bondage from which he has fled by the tone of pleasant surprise\r\nand buoyant gratitude with which he welcomes the commonest gifts of\r\nmother nature. He is as impressible as a schoolboy let loose for the\r\nlong vacation.\r\n\r\nThere is a vein of loving trustfulness pervading his narrative that is\r\nreally touching. Our young, vigorous, and hearty settler, glorying in\r\nhis privilege to struggle, achieve, and conquer difficulties, is too\r\nproud to be ashamed of his dependence on Him who appointed the planets\r\nto their courses, and is not unmindful of a sparrow's fall. How fine and\r\ndelicately tender is this retrospective glance at the close of his\r\nmonthly record for April!\r\n\r\n     'Four months have fled away like a busy though pleasant dream since\r\n     I laid myself down to my first night's repose in my homestead. The\r\n     Giver of all good gifts has crowned my poor efforts with his tender\r\n     mercies, and as I look up from these pages through the arcade of\r\n     fruit-bearing trees and onward to the gentle hill-slope now green\r\n     with springing corn, and beautiful in the promise of future\r\n     abundance, I feel a perfect and grateful trust--far, far too deep\r\n     for my weak powers of utterance--that He will never forsake the\r\n     humble laborer in this fair field of His creation.'\r\n\r\nAnd he is instructive withal. His book is a perfect _vade mecum_ for\r\nbeginners in tropical farming. To such it is literally 'guide,\r\ncounsellor, and friend.' Colonists going out to Santo Domingo will do\r\nwell to include a copy in their outfit, and, as far as practicable,\r\nfollow in the footsteps of their sturdy and genial predecessor.\r\n\r\nThe reader need not expect to find in this work a sensation story. It is\r\nanything but that. Neither, being exclusively descriptive of the\r\nbeneficent arts of peace, can it in any sense come under the head of\r\nwhat is termed war literature. Yet it is safe to affirm that without the\r\ngreat rebellion this book had never been written. It is full of novel,\r\npicturesque, and widely suggestive ideas. Some of its statements tear\r\naway old fallacies as by a cannon ball. For instance, where the young\r\nsettler states as matter of experience:\r\n\r\n     'Those who say the treasures of the tropics are to be best won by\r\n     the brute force of ignorant labor, cannot have studied with\r\n     sufficient patience the march of invention. Intelligent laborers,\r\n     men who know how to make wood and iron do their harvest work to the\r\n     sparing of human sinews, men who can work steam in harness, these\r\n     are what is wanted here. Those, too, are mistaken who fancy that no\r\n     skin but a black one can cover the firm muscle and vigorous\r\n     endurance of a perfect and hardy manhood. The most manly workers I\r\n     have seen in this country are _white men_. They know how to obtain\r\n     and use the best class of labor-saving machines, and they trust no\r\n     one but themselves to manage them, for they know that superior\r\n     implements and the recklessness of brute force don't work well\r\n     together. Under the warm sun of the tropics white men and machinery\r\n     will yet open the grandest field of civilization.'\r\n\r\nThis goes to confirm us in the opinion we have long entertained and\r\nadvanced in these pages, that the result of the great political change\r\nwe are now undergoing will be for the benefit of white men. It has been\r\nso often asserted that only black men can work in the tropics, that\r\npeople have come to acquiesce in the statement without investigation.\r\nThe record of this work is to the point in helping to dispel so\r\nwidespread a delusion.\r\n\r\nWhoever, at this delightful season, wishes to enjoy a book written in\r\npure, gushing English, attuned to the gentle harmonies of nature, and be\r\nrefreshed by sympathy with its kind and grateful spirit, will not fail\r\nto read 'In the Tropics.'\r\n\r\n\r\nHARPER'S PICTORIAL HISTORY OF THE GREAT REBELLION IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nThis work is issued in semi-monthly numbers, at twenty-five cents per\r\nnumber, appearing about the first and fifteenth of each month. The\r\nintroduction contains a succinct account of the formation of the\r\nConfederacy of the States; the formation and adoption of the\r\nConstitution of the United States, and the establishment of the National\r\nGovernment; the origin, development, and progress of the doctrines of\r\nnullification and secession, and the various phases which they assumed\r\nuntil their final culmination in the Great Rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations comprise portraits of those who have borne a prominent\r\npart in the struggle; maps of the different localities; plans of the\r\nleading actions; views of scenes of interest and of the most important\r\nbattles.\r\n\r\nThe work is profusely and graphically illustrated, and we think this\r\nserial cannot fail to become popular. We learn much and readily through\r\nthe eye, and the importance of faithfully executed pictures can scarcely\r\nbe overestimated. The portraits given in the work are _portraits_, and\r\nnot _caricatures_. It contains a careful, comprehensive, and minute\r\nrecord of the progress of the war, and is written with ability and\r\nspirit. It promises to be impartial, accurate, and artistic.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORTH PACIFIC REVIEW. A Journal of Literature, History, Science,\r\nCorrespondence, and Fine Arts. San Francisco: Dalgleish & Co.,\r\npublishers and proprietors.\r\n\r\nThe Continental extends a warm greeting to her sister of the West,\r\nfeeling not only the strong bonds of the literary amenities, but the far\r\nstronger ties of patriotism and loyalty, so ably defined in the opening\r\narticle of the _North Pacific_. Loyalty is indeed something more than\r\nfidelity to one's country and Government, based upon a sense of interest\r\nor of obligation: it is _fidelity based upon love_.\r\n\r\nYoung and glorious West! May such loyalty ever distinguish you, and such\r\nfeelings link in close and ever closer union the children of the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific shores! On the maintenance of such love hangs the\r\nwhole future of humanity!\r\n\r\n\r\nSANDERS' UNION FOURTH READER; embracing a full Exposition of the\r\nPrinciples of Rhetorical Reading, with numerous exercises for practice,\r\nboth in prose and poetry, various in style, and carefully adapted to the\r\npurposes of teaching in schools of every grade. By CHARLES W. SANDERS,\r\nA.M. New York: Ivison, Phinney & Co.\r\n\r\nA valuable aid to scholar and teacher. The selections have been made\r\nwith great care, and give evidence of refined taste, and, while\r\nperfectly adapted for practice in rhetorical reading, are admirably\r\ncalculated to quicken the moral perceptions and awaken the finer\r\nsensibilities of the scholar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECEIVED.\r\n\r\n\r\nA HISTORY OF THE INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT OF EUROPE. By JOHN WILLIAM\r\nDRAPER, M.D., LL.D., Prof. of Chemistry and Physiology in the University\r\nof New York, author of a 'Treatise on Human Physiology,' &c., &c. Harper\r\nand Brother, publishers, Franklin Square, New York.\r\n\r\nA book apparently of great erudition and research. Being received too\r\nlate for reading, and reviewing in the July number of THE CONTINENTAL,\r\nit is our intention to return to it in our August issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S TABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTER AND SPIRIT.\r\n\r\nWe do not ordinarily feel disposed to criticize the articles of our\r\ncontributors; nor do we feel disposed now to do more than to offer a\r\nbrief suggestion in reference to a philosophical position assumed by the\r\nauthor of an interesting article in our last number, entitled, 'TOUCHING\r\nTHE SOUL.' The writer assumes that matter and spirit are so utterly\r\nopposite in their respective natures that they cannot be made to act\r\ntogether in any way. For instance, he says: 'Here again the argument is\r\nclinched by the mere distinction between matter and spirit, the one\r\nbeing the very antipodes of, and incapable of acting upon the other.'\r\nAnd again: 'To sum up the whole argument in a single sentence, the\r\nphysical senses are dependent for their perceptions upon the action of\r\nmatter, and hence spirit, which is not matter, can in no way affect\r\nthem.'\r\n\r\nUnquestionably this statement is contradictory in itself, and, at all\r\nevents, cannot possibly be sustained to the extent of the assertion. The\r\nactual existence of the soul in the body, and the perception of physical\r\nobjects and effects by the senses, are proofs undeniable that in this\r\ninstance, at least, there are mutual action and reaction between matter\r\nand spirit. If it be said that this connection of the soul with the\r\norganized frame is the only condition in which the material and\r\nimmaterial are known to be capable of acting upon each other, it is yet\r\nwholly inaccurate and unphilosophical to say that this mutual action is\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nBut, in truth, the assertion is unphilosophical and incorrect in a far\r\nwider sense, and in reference to a much more extensive range of\r\nphenomena than those which concern the mysterious relations of the soul\r\nwith the human body. Throughout all nature are to be seen the plainest\r\nindications of the influence and operation of spirit on the material\r\nworld. It is spirit only which animates, informs, and shapes the whole\r\nuniverse. Wherever law prevails (and where does it not?) there is\r\nintelligence, spirit, soul, acting to sustain it, during every moment of\r\nits operation. Indeed it is doubtful whether any other than spiritual\r\npower is to be found anywhere in nature. It seems to be too obvious a\r\ntruth to admit of any doubt or question, that matter, if it be of a\r\nnature opposite to that of spirit, has been created as the instrument of\r\nsoul, having properties suited to the harmonious coöperation of the two,\r\nin their respective purposes in nature. To represent matter as something\r\nwholly antagonistic to spirit and incapable of any relations with it, is\r\nto ignore all our own experience, and the significance of all the grand\r\nphenomena of nature.\r\n\r\nHowever great may be the distinction between matter and spirit, the\r\nCreator has evidently established the closest relationship between them.\r\nAll that we can ever know of matter arises from its power to affect the\r\nsoul,--through the senses while we remain in the body, whatever may be\r\nits relations to the spirit in another state of existence. If we take,\r\nfor instance, the inertia of matter, and consider it philosophically, we\r\ncan make of it nothing more than a power of resistance, or persistence,\r\nresiding in certain points, which we call particles of matter. The same\r\nis true of attraction and repulsion. These are forces residing in the\r\nsame points; and these forces are all we know, or can know, about them.\r\nSo of the sensible qualities of matter; color, for instance. This is\r\nmerely the power of the same points, to cause vibrations in an elastic\r\nmedium; and these, acting on the sensorium, communicate sensations, and\r\nbecome the basis of ideas in the soul. Who can say this subtile power,\r\nresiding in the points which we call particles of matter, is not\r\nspiritual in its nature? Or, indeed, who can affirm, with absolute\r\ncertainty, that there is anything else known to us in the universe,\r\nexcept that which is kindred to the soul by its power to communicate\r\nwith and inform it. From the very dawn of our existence we have been\r\nencased in what we call matter, and have derived all our education from\r\nit. It is the only medium by which we communicate with each other; nor\r\nhave we any other means of climbing up to a knowledge of GOD himself. We\r\ndo not mean to say that the spirit of man has no faculties for a direct\r\nperception of divine influences; but simply that the material world is\r\nthe appointed instrument for educating the human soul, through the\r\nsenses, to the consciousness and intelligent use of its highest and\r\nnoblest faculties.\r\n\r\nBy human means, and, also, by all the tremendous operations of nature,\r\nso far as they are known to man, matter is wholly indestructible. No\r\ninstance is known, from the beginning of creation, in which a single\r\nparticle of matter has been annihilated. Can anything more be said of\r\nthe soul? Or should we not rather feel relieved, and freed from much\r\ndoubt, if we had an equal assurance of the continued existence of the\r\nsoul after the great change which separates it from the body? May we\r\nnot, at least, without any humiliation, admit our kindred to the dust in\r\nwhich we dwell, and recognize in it a creation, coeval with the soul and\r\nintended for its use, with points of contact and mutual coöperation,\r\nwhich render matter and spirit not wholly at war with each other, but\r\nunited in a common destiny, to be continued at least as long as the\r\nduration of the human race on the surface of the earth?\r\n\r\nAs to the singular phenomena to which our author intends to apply his\r\nargument, we can only say that they cannot be disproved in the mode\r\nattempted. We have no such knowledge of the facts as would enable us to\r\nform any opinion on the subject. But if many good men have not been\r\negregiously deceived, the phenomena in question indicate the speedy\r\ndiscovery of relations not hitherto suspected to exist between matter\r\nand spirit. We do not anticipate the development of any other than\r\nnatural laws. We are not credulous as to the interference of\r\nsupernatural agencies; but we are fully prepared for almost any\r\ndiscoveries in the department of psychology, unveiling the\r\nmysterious but unquestionable relations of harmony--of action and\r\nreaction--existing between the soul of man and the universe of GOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nON HORSEBACK.\r\n\r\nThose who have scanned with critical eye the cavalry regiments that have\r\nlately trooped through our cities from various States of the Union, on\r\ntheir way to the banks of the Potomac, must in candor, if with\r\nreluctance, acknowledge that we are not just yet a nation of horsemen.\r\nThat our troopers have got a knack of 'sticking on' we will admit; but\r\nthere are ways of fulfilling that necessary condition with more ease to\r\nthe horse, more grace in the action, and more certainty of being able to\r\nuse the weapons with precision, than the present very unartistic method\r\ncommon to horsemen generally in most parts of the country. Within a\r\nquarter of a century much improvement has taken place in the system of\r\nequestrianism under which the cavalry riders of Europe are instructed.\r\nYears ago, the long stirrups, such as our dragoons for the most part\r\nride with, were taken up some inches by the riding masters of the\r\nBritish and other foreign services. It was the superior horsemanship of\r\nriders brought up in that best of all riding schools, the fox-hunting\r\nfield, that first drew the attention of cavalry teachers to the\r\nnecessity of affording a firmer _appui_ to the horseman than he can\r\nobtain from stirrups, to keep his feet in contact with which he is\r\nobliged to point his toes downward with painful perseverance. All the\r\ngood 'hunting horsemen,' as they are termed, of England and Ireland,\r\nride with short stirrups. So do the Cossack cavalry, the best troop\r\nhorsemen, perhaps, in the world. The Arab rides with very short\r\nstirrups, which makes him look, when mounted, as if he were sitting on a\r\nlow chair. But the seat thus obtained by the Arab is not one for men who\r\nhave to gallop across a country intersected with fences and other\r\nobstacles. In stirrups, as in most other things, there is a _juste\r\nmilieu_; and if the American dragoon is on one side of that, so is the\r\nArab of the Desert on the other. The late Capt. Nolan, who fell in the\r\nfamous charge of the Six Hundred at Balaklava, did much to introduce a\r\nperfect system of horsemanship into cavalry regiments. He published a\r\nwork upon the subject, in which he advocates the short stirrup, and\r\nbases his system, generally, upon the hunting style of horsemanship. We\r\nhave seen some very bad riders among British cavalry officers, brought\r\nup in the old-school method of seat and band. Indeed, some satirical\r\nwriter or another has said there are two professional classes to whom it\r\nis impossible to impart the art of horsemanship--sailors and cavalry\r\nofficers: but that was going a trifle too far, as we have seen specimens\r\nof both the one and the other capable of acquitting themselves very well\r\n'across country,' which is the test, _par excellence_, of good riding.\r\nThat was in later days, however, and since the reforms of the riding\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn spite of some repulsive features, we insert the accompanying picture.\r\nThe subject chosen is not of that character which the highest genius\r\nloves to depict; yet it is vigorously drawn, and doubtless true to\r\nnature. At the present time it may be useful as a fair representation of\r\nmany specimens of the boasted Southern cavalier.--F. P. S.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTHERN COLONEL.\r\n\r\nStrolling, one morning in 1847, into a Virginia barroom, I accosted a\r\nlittle, puffy-looking man with \"Major, can you\"--whereupon, drawing up\r\nlike a bantam, he snapped out, \"You're mistaken; I am a colonel;\" the\r\ncolonel being in those days as peculiar to Southern society as the cross\r\nto southern constellations. I proceeded to anatomize this representative\r\nspecimen.\r\n\r\nWhere he obtained his title no one knew. Some thought it hereditary, his\r\ngrandfather having been a colonel in the Revolution; others supposed it\r\nto have been won by conducting the Mexican campaign in the columns of\r\nthe _Warrior_, after the manner of modern editors; and a few ignorant\r\nsouls believed he had been born with it in his mouth, instead of a\r\nsilver spoon. As to the man himself, his great-great-grandmother was a\r\nHuguenot; his grandissimo-grandfather came over with Lafayette, and when\r\nhe made affirmation on \"my stars and garters,\" he was supposed to have\r\nreference to certain insignia of nobility, heirlooms in the family from\r\nthe time of Charlemagne. He had not stature enough for tallness, nor\r\nbulk enough for breadth, in his figure resembled the wooden soldiers in\r\nthe panorama of Bunker Hill, who ran down hill at every fire without\r\nmoving their legs, and, like a kangaroo, had small feet and head in\r\nproportion. He made his front hair into a curl, hanging over his nose,\r\nlike an index finger, and signed his initials with astonishing flourish,\r\nG. B. A., usually rendered by the boys \"Great Big Ayres.\" He spent the\r\nwinter dormant, like a polar bear, and, in summer, like chaste Diana,\r\nfollowed the hunt, took his morals from Tom Paine, and was, as he said\r\nof himself, neither a good Christian nor a bad infidel. He entered\r\nGovernment service in his youth, got drunk, and had been in that\r\ncondition ever since, varied by occasionally getting gloriously drunk.\r\nThe only difference between him and a sot was drinking his liquors\r\ngenteelly from his own cellar, and lying in bed when a sot lies in the\r\ngutter. When he was beastliest, he made frequent allusions to the\r\ncooling board, referring to a revel, in which, having covered himself\r\nwith glory, he awoke from a dead drunk to find himself arrayed in his\r\nshroud, since which he has been in the habit of designating himself a\r\nresurrectionist. He sported an immense diamond, represented to be one of\r\nthe honors awarded him by Government, and loaded himself with rings,\r\nchains, and charms, which gave him resemblance to the show figure in a\r\njeweller's window. He had a passion for the drama, was forever posting\r\nto the city to inspect debutantes and prima donnas, was a connoisseur of\r\nwomen, and considered a young girl, who knew \"the times that try men's\r\nsouls\" to be a quotation from Tom Paine, the most astonishing specimen\r\nthat had ever come under his observation. He was the victim of scandal,\r\nand usually finished his anathemas on the village gossips by wishing\r\nthat they were in \"Father Abraham's bosom or some other old\r\ngentleman's.\" He attended all the fashionable soirees, and might\r\ngenerally be heard informing his friends that the next piece on the\r\nprogramme \"is brandy smash and cocktails.\" He had a habit of mistaking\r\nhis quotations, and had been known to declare, in his fits of drunken\r\naberration, that he could say with John Quincy Adams, \"I still live.\" At\r\nlast accounts he had joined a rebel company, which mustered twelve guns\r\nand an officer for every private. A. JACK STONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n  The\r\n  Continental Monthly.\r\n\r\nThe readers of the CONTINENTAL are aware of the important\r\nposition it has assumed, of the influence which it exerts, and of the\r\nbrilliant array of political and literary talent of the highest order\r\nwhich supports it. No publication of the kind has, in this country, so\r\nsuccessfully combined the energy and freedom of the daily newspaper with\r\nthe higher literary tone of the first-class monthly; and it is very\r\ncertain that no magazine has given wider range to its contributors, or\r\npreserved itself so completely from the narrow influences of party or of\r\nfaction. In times like the present, such a journal is either a power in\r\nthe land or it is nothing. That the CONTINENTAL is not the\r\nlatter is abundantly evidenced _by what it has done_--by the reflection\r\nof its counsels in many important public events, and in the character\r\nand power of those who are its staunchest supporters.\r\n\r\nThough but little more than a year has elapsed since the\r\nCONTINENTAL was first established, it has during that time\r\nacquired a strength and a political significance elevating it to a\r\nposition far above that previously occupied by any publication of the\r\nkind in America. In proof of which assertion we call attention to the\r\nfollowing facts:\r\n\r\n1. Of its POLITICAL articles republished in pamphlet form, a\r\nsingle one has had, thus far, a circulation of _one hundred and six\r\nthousand_ copies.\r\n\r\n2. From its LITERARY department, a single serial novel, \"Among\r\nthe Pines,\" has, within a very few months, sold nearly _thirty-five\r\nthousand_ copies. Two other series of its literary articles have also\r\nbeen republished in book form, while the first portion of a third is\r\nalready in press.\r\n\r\nNo more conclusive facts need be alleged to prove the excellence of the\r\ncontributions to the CONTINENTAL, or their _extraordinary\r\npopularity;_ and its conductors are determined that it shall not fall\r\nbehind. Preserving all \"the boldness, vigor, and ability\" which a\r\nthousand journals have attributed to it, it will greatly enlarge its\r\ncircle of action, and discuss, fearlessly and frankly, every principle\r\ninvolved in the great questions of the day. The first minds of the\r\ncountry, embracing the men most familiar with its diplomacy and most\r\ndistinguished for ability, are among its contributors; and it is no mere\r\n\"flattering promise of a prospectus\" to say that this \"magazine for the\r\ntimes\" will employ the first intellect in America, under auspices which\r\nno publication ever enjoyed before in this country.\r\n\r\nWhile the CONTINENTAL will express decided opinions on the\r\ngreat questions of the day, it will not be a mere political journal:\r\nmuch the larger portion of its columns will be enlivened, as heretofore,\r\nby tales, poetry, and humor. In a word, the CONTINENTAL will be\r\nfound, under its new staff of Editors, occupying a position and\r\npresenting attractions never before found in a magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERMS TO CLUBS.\r\n\r\n  Two copies for one year,                    Five dollars.\r\n  Three copies for one year,                   Six dollars.\r\n  Six copies for one year,                  Eleven dollars.\r\n  Eleven copies for one year,                Twenty dollars.\r\n  Twenty copies for one year,            Thirty-six dollars.\r\n                           PAID IN ADVANCE\r\n\r\n_Postage, Thirty-six cents a year_, to be paid BY THE\r\nSUBSCRIBER.\r\n\r\nSINGLE COPIES.\r\n\r\nThree dollars a year, IN ADVANCE. _Postage paid by the\r\nPublisher_.\r\n\r\n  JOHN F.

No State in the Valley of the\r\nMississippi offers so great an inducement to the settler as the State of\r\nIllinois. There is no part of the world where all the conditions of\r\nclimate and soil so admirably combine to produce those two great\r\nstaples, CORN and WHEAT.\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\nNowhere can the Industrious farmer secure such immediate results from\r\nhis labor as on these deep, rich, loamy soils, cultivated with so much\r\nease. The climate from the extreme southern part of the State to the\r\nTerre Haute, Alton and St. Louis Railroad, a distance of nearly 200\r\nmiles, is well adapted to Winter.\r\n\r\nWHEAT, CORN, COTTON, TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nPeaches, Pears, Tomatoes, and every variety of fruit and vegetables is\r\ngrown in great abundance, from which Chicago and other Northern markets\r\nare furnished from four to six weeks earlier than their immediate\r\nvicinity. Between the Terre Haute, Alton & St. Louis Railway and the\r\nKankakee and Illinois Rivers, (a distance of 115 miles on the Branch,\r\nand 136 miles on the Main Trunk,) lies the great Corn and Stock raising\r\nportion of the State.\r\n\r\nTHE ORDINARY YIELD\r\n\r\nof Corn is from 60 to 80 bushels per acre. Cattle, Horses, Mules, Sheep\r\nand Hogs are raised here at a small cost, and yield large profits. It is\r\nbelieved that no section of country presents greater inducements for\r\nDairy Farming than the Prairies of Illinois, a branch of farming to\r\nwhich but little attention has been paid, and which must yield sure\r\nprofitable results. Between the Kankakee and Illinois Rivers, and\r\nChicago and Dunleith, (a distance of 56 miles on the Branch and 147\r\nmiles by the Main Trunk,) Timothy Hay, Spring Wheat, Corn, &c., are\r\nproduced in great abundance.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural products of Illinois are greater than those of any\r\nother State. The Wheat crop of 1861 was estimated at 35,000,000 bushels,\r\nwhile the Corn crop yields not less than 140,000,000 bushels besides the\r\ncrop of Oats, Barley, Rye, Buckwheat, Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes,\r\nPumpkins, Squashes, Flax, Hemp, Peas, Clover, Cabbage, Beets, Tobacco,\r\nSorgheim, Grapes, Peaches, Apples, &c., which go to swell the vast\r\naggregate of production in this fertile region. Over Four Million tons\r\nof produce were sent out the State of Illinois during the past year.\r\n\r\nSTOCK RAISING.\r\n\r\nIn Central and Southern Illinois uncommon advantages are presented for\r\nthe extension of Stock raising. All kinds of Cattle, Horses, Mules,\r\nSheep, Hogs, &c., of the best breeds, yield handsome profits; large\r\nfortunes have already been made, and the field is open for others to\r\nenter with the fairest prospects of like results. Dairy Farming also\r\npresents its inducements to many.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF COTTON.\r\n\r\nThe experiments in Cotton culture are of very great promise. Commencing\r\nin latitude 39 deg. 30 min. (see Mattoon on the Branch, and Assumption\r\non the Main Line), the Company owns thousands of acres well adapted to\r\nthe perfection of this fibre. A settler having a family of young\r\nchildren, can turn their youthful labor to a most profitable account in\r\nthe growth and perfection of this plant.\r\n\r\nTHE ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD\r\n\r\nTraverses the whole length of the State, from the banks of the\r\nMississippi and Lake Michigan to the Ohio. As its name imports, the\r\nRailroad runs through the centre of the State, and on either side of the\r\nroad along its whole length lie the lands offered for sale.\r\n\r\nCITIES, TOWNS, MARKETS, DEPOTS.\r\n\r\nThere are Ninety-eight Depots on the Company's Railway, giving about one\r\nevery seven miles. Cities, Towns and Villages are situated at convenient\r\ndistances throughout the whole route, where every desirable commodity\r\nmay be found as readily as in the oldest cities of the Union, and where\r\nbuyers are to be met for all kinds of farm produce.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION.\r\n\r\nMechanics and working-men will find the free school system encouraged by\r\nthe State, and endowed with a large revenue for the support of the\r\nschools. Children can live in sight of the school, the college, the\r\nchurch, and grow up with the prosperity of the leading State in the\r\nGreat Western Empire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPRICES AND TERMS OF PAYMENT--ON LONG CREDIT.\r\n\r\n  80 acres at $10 per acre, with interest at 6 per ct. annually\r\n  on the following terms:\r\n\r\n  Cash payment                 $48 00\r\n\r\n  Payment in one year           48 00\r\n     \"    in two years          48 00\r\n     \"    in three years        48 00\r\n     \"    in four years        236 00\r\n     \"    in five years        224 00\r\n     \"    in six years         212 00\r\n\r\n\r\n  40 acres, at $10 00 per acre:\r\n\r\n  Cash payment                 $24 00\r\n\r\n  Payment in one year           24 00\r\n     \"    in two years          24 00\r\n     \"    in three years        24 00\r\n     \"    in four years        118 00\r\n     \"    in five years        112 00\r\n     \"    in six years         106 00\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber 20. 25 Cents.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nCONTINENTAL\r\n\r\nMONTHLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVOTED TO\r\n\r\nLiterature and National Policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUST, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK:\r\n  JOHN F.
