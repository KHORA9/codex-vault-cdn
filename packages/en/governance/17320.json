I adhere to the opinions expressed in that essay so far as they\r\ngo, but it will be obvious to any one who has paid attention to Indian\r\naffairs that, if the subject had to be treated now, many very important\r\nissues, to which I have not alluded, would have to be imported into the\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nCROMER.\r\n\r\n_September 30, 1913._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                        PAGE\r\n\"THE EDINBURGH REVIEW\"\r\n\r\nI.

Does a similar fate await the British Empire? Are\r\nwe so far self-deceived, and are we so incapable of peering into the\r\nfuture as to be unable to see that many of the steps which now appear\r\ncalculated to enhance and to stereotype Anglo-Saxon domination, are but\r\nthe precursors of a period of national decay and senility?\r\n\r\nA thorough examination of this vital question would necessarily involve\r\nthe treatment of a great variety of subjects. The heart of the British\r\nEmpire is to be found in Great Britain. It is not proposed in this place\r\nto deal either with the working of British political institutions, or\r\nwith the various important social and economic problems which the actual\r\ncondition of England presents, but only with the extremities of the body\r\npolitic, and more especially with those where the inhabitants of the\r\ncountries under British rule are not of Anglo-Saxon origin.\r\n\r\nWhat should be the profession of faith of a sound but reasonable\r\nImperialist? He will not be possessed with any secret desire to see the\r\nwhole of Africa or of Asia painted red on the maps. He will entertain\r\nnot only a moral dislike, but also a political mistrust of that\r\nexcessive earth-hunger, which views with jealous eyes the extension of\r\nother and neighbouring European nations. He will have no fear of\r\ncompetition. He will believe that, in the treatment of subject races,\r\nthe methods of government practised by England, though sometimes open to\r\nlegitimate criticism, are superior, morally and economically, to those\r\nof any other foreign nation; and that, strong in the possession and\r\nmaintenance of those methods, we shall be able to hold our own against\r\nall competitors.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, he will have no sympathy with those who, as Lord\r\nCromer said in a recent speech, \"are so fearful of Imperial greatness\r\nthat they are unwilling that we should accomplish our manifest destiny,\r\nand who would thus have us sink into political insignificance by\r\nrefusing the main title which makes us great.\"\r\n\r\nAn Imperial policy must, of course, be carried out with reasonable\r\nprudence, and the principles of government which guide our relations\r\nwith whatsoever races are brought under our control must be politically\r\nand economically sound and morally defensible. This is, in fact, the\r\nkeystone of the Imperial arch. The main justification of Imperialism is\r\nto be found in the use which is made of the Imperial power. If we make a\r\ngood use of our power, we may face the future without fear that we shall\r\nbe overtaken by the Nemesis which attended Roman misrule. If the reverse\r\nis the case, the British Empire will deserve to fall, and of a surety it\r\nwill ultimately fall. There is truth in the saying, of which perhaps we\r\nsometimes hear rather too much, that the maintenance of the Empire\r\ndepends on the sword; but so little does it depend on the sword alone\r\nthat if once we have to draw the sword, not merely to suppress some\r\nlocal effervescence, but to overcome a general upheaval of subject\r\nraces goaded to action either by deliberate oppression, which is highly\r\nimprobable, or by unintentional misgovernment, which is far more\r\nconceivable, the sword will assuredly be powerless to defend us for\r\nlong, and the days of our Imperial rule will be numbered.\r\n\r\nTo those who believe that when they rest from their earthly labours\r\ntheir works will follow them, and that they must account to a Higher\r\nTribunal for the use or misuse of any powers which may have been\r\nentrusted to them in this world, no further defence of the plea that\r\nImperialism should rest on a moral basis is required. Those who\r\nentertain no such belief may perhaps be convinced by the argument that,\r\nfrom a national point of view, a policy based on principles of sound\r\nmorality is wiser, inasmuch as it is likely to be more successful, than\r\none which excludes all considerations save those of cynical\r\nself-interest. There was truth in the commonplace remark made by a\r\nsubject of ancient Rome, himself a slave and presumably of Oriental\r\nextraction, that bad government will bring the mightiest empire to\r\nruin.[2]\r\n\r\nSome advantage may perhaps be derived from inquiring, however briefly\r\nand imperfectly, into the causes which led to the ruin of that\r\npolitical edifice, which in point of grandeur and extent, is alone\r\nworthy of comparison with the British Empire. The subject has been\r\ntreated by many of the most able writers and thinkers whom the world has\r\nproduced--Gibbon, Guizot, Mommsen, Milman, Seeley, and others. For\r\npresent purposes the classification given by Mr. Hodgkin of the causes\r\nwhich led to the downfall of the Western Empire has been adopted. They\r\nwere six in number, viz.:\r\n\r\n1. The foundation of Constantinople.\r\n\r\n2. Christianity.\r\n\r\n3. Slavery.\r\n\r\n4. The pauperisation of the Roman proletariat.\r\n\r\n5. The destruction of the middle class by the fiscal oppression of the\r\n   Curiales.\r\n\r\n6. Barbarous finance.\r\n\r\n1. _The Foundation of Constantinople._--It is, for obvious reasons,\r\nunnecessary to discuss this cause. It was one of special application to\r\nthe circumstances of the time, notably to the threatening attitude\r\ntowards Rome assumed by the now decadent State of Persia.\r\n\r\n2. _Christianity._--That the foundation of Christianity exercised a\r\nprofoundly disintegrating effect on the Roman Empire is unquestionable.\r\nGibbon, although he possibly confounds the tenets of the new creed with\r\nthe defects of its hierarchy, dwells with characteristic emphasis on\r\nthis congenial subject.[3] Mr. Hodgkin, speaking of the analogy between\r\nthe British present and the Roman past, says:\r\n\r\n     The Christian religion is with us no explosive force threatening\r\n     the disruption of our most cherished institutions. On the contrary,\r\n     it has been said, not as a mere figure of speech, that\r\n     \"Christianity is part of the common law of England.\" And even the\r\n     bitterest enemies of our religion will scarcely deny that, upon the\r\n     whole, a nation imbued with the teaching of the New Testament is\r\n     more easy to govern than one which derived its notions of divine\r\n     morality from the stories of the dwellers on Olympus.\r\n\r\nFrom the special point of view now under consideration, the case for\r\nChristianity admits of being even more strongly stated than this, for no\r\nattempt will be made to deal with the principles which should guide the\r\ngovernment of a people imbued with the teaching of the New Testament,\r\nbut rather with the subordinate, but still highly important question of\r\nthe treatment which a people, presumed to be already imbued with that\r\nteaching, should accord to subject races who are ignorant or irreceptive\r\nof its precepts. From this point of view it may be said that\r\nChristianity, far from being an explosive force, is not merely a\r\npowerful ally. It is an ally without whose assistance continued success\r\nis unattainable. Although dictates of worldly prudence and opportunism\r\nare alone sufficient to ensure the rejection of a policy of official\r\nproselytism, it is none the less true that the code of Christian\r\nmorality is the only sure foundation on which the whole of our vast\r\nImperial fabric can be built if it is to be durable. The stability of\r\nour rule depends to a great extent upon whether the forces acting in\r\nfavour of applying the Christian code of morality to subject races are\r\ncapable of overcoming those moving in a somewhat opposite direction. We\r\nare inclined to think that our Teutonic veracity and gravity, our\r\nnational conscientiousness, our British spirit of fair play, to use the\r\ncant phrase of the day, our free institutions, and our press--which,\r\nalthough it occasionally shows unpleasant symptoms of sinking beneath\r\nthe yoke of special and not highly reputable interests, is still greatly\r\nsuperior in tone to that of any other nation--are sufficient guarantees\r\nagainst relapse into the morass of political immorality which\r\ncharacterised the relations between nation and nation, and notably\r\nbetween the strong and the weak, even so late as the eighteenth\r\ncentury.[4] It is to be hoped and believed that, for the time being,\r\nthis contention is well founded, but what assurance is there--if the\r\nBook which embodies the code of Christian morality may without\r\nirreverence be quoted--that \"that which is done is that which shall be\r\ndone\"?[5] That is the crucial question.\r\n\r\nThere appear to be at present existent in England two different Imperial\r\nschools of thought, which, without being absolutely antagonistic,\r\nrepresent very opposite principles. One school, which, for want of a\r\nbetter name, may be styled that of philanthropy, is occasionally tainted\r\nwith the zeal which outruns discretion, and with the want of accuracy\r\nwhich often characterises those whose emotions predominate over their\r\nreason. The violence and want of mental equilibrium at times displayed\r\nby the partisans of this school of thought not infrequently give rise to\r\nmisgivings lest the Duke of Wellington should have prophesied truly when\r\nhe said, \"If you lose India, the House of Commons will lose it for\r\nyou.\"[6] These manifest defects should not, however, blind us to the\r\nfact that the philanthropists and sentimentalists are deeply imbued with\r\nthe grave national responsibilities which devolve on England, and with\r\nthe lofty aspirations which attach themselves to her civilising and\r\nmoralising mission.\r\n\r\nThe other is the commercial school. Pitt once said that \"British policy\r\nis British trade.\" The general correctness of this aphorism cannot be\r\nchallenged, but, like most aphorisms, it only conveys a portion of the\r\ntruth; for the commercial spirit, though eminently beneficent when under\r\nsome degree of moral control, may become not merely hurtful, but even\r\nsubversive of Imperial dominion, when it is allowed to run riot.\r\nLivingstone said that in five hundred years the only thing the natives\r\nof Africa had learnt from the Portuguese was to distil bad spirits with\r\nthe help of an old gun barrel. This is, without doubt, an extreme\r\ncase--so extreme, indeed, that even the hardened conscience of\r\ndiplomatic Europe was eventually shamed into taking some half-hearted\r\naction in the direction of preventing a whole continent from being\r\ndemoralised in order that the distillers and vendors of cheap spirits\r\nmight realise large profits. But it would not be difficult to cite other\r\nanalogous, though less striking, instances. Occasions are, indeed, not\r\ninfrequent when the interests of commerce apparently clash with those of\r\ngood government. The word \"apparently\" is used with intent; for though\r\nsome few individuals may acquire a temporary benefit by sacrificing\r\nmoral principle on the altar of pecuniary gain, it may confidently be\r\nstated that, in respect to the wider and more lasting benefits of trade,\r\nno real antagonism exists between commercial self-interest and public\r\nmorality.[7]\r\n\r\nTo be more explicit, what is meant when it is said that the commercial\r\nspirit should be under some control is this--that in dealing with\r\nIndians or Egyptians, or Shilluks, or Zulus, the first question is to\r\nconsider what course is most conducive to Indian, Egyptian, Shilluk, or\r\nZulu interests. We need not always inquire too closely what these\r\npeople, who are all, nationally speaking, more or less _in statu\r\npupillari_, themselves think is best in their own interests, although\r\nthis is a point which deserves serious consideration. But it is\r\nessential that each special issue should be decided mainly with\r\nreference to what, by the light of Western knowledge and experience\r\ntempered by local considerations, we conscientiously think is best for\r\nthe subject race, without reference to any real or supposed advantage\r\nwhich may accrue to England as a nation, or--as is more frequently the\r\ncase--to the special interests represented by some one or more\r\ninfluential classes of Englishmen. If the British nation as a whole\r\npersistently bears this principle in mind, and insists sternly on its\r\napplication, though we can never create a patriotism akin to that based\r\non affinity of race or community of language, we may perhaps foster some\r\nsort of cosmopolitan allegiance grounded on the respect always accorded\r\nto superior talents and unselfish conduct, and on the gratitude derived\r\nboth from favours conferred and from those to come.[8] There may then at\r\nall events be some hope that the Egyptian will hesitate before he throws\r\nin his lot with any future Arabi The Berberine dweller on the banks of\r\nthe Nile may, perhaps, cast no wistful glances back to the time when,\r\nalbeit he or his progenitors were oppressed, the oppression came from\r\nthe hand of a co-religionist. Even the Central African savage may\r\neventually learn to chant a hymn in honour of _Astraea Redux_, as\r\nrepresented by the British official who denies him gin but gives him\r\njustice. More than this, commerce will gain. It must necessarily follow\r\nin the train of civilisation, and, whilst it will speedily droop if that\r\ncivilisation is spurious, it will, on the other hand, increase in volume\r\nin direct proportion to the extent to which the true principles of\r\nWestern progress are assimilated by the subjects of the British king and\r\nthe customers of the British trader. This latter must be taught patience\r\nat the hands, of the statesman and the moralist. It is a somewhat\r\ndifficult lesson to learn. The trader not only wishes to acquire wealth;\r\nhe not infrequently wishes that its acquisition should be rapid, even at\r\nthe expense of morality and of the permanent interests of his country.\r\n\r\n                          Nam dives qui fieri vult,\r\n    Et cito vult fieri. Sed quae reverentia legum,\r\n    Quis metus aut pudor est unquam properantis avari?[9]\r\n\r\nThis question demands consideration from another point of view. A clever\r\nFrenchman, keenly alive to what he thought was the decadence of his own\r\nnation, published a remarkable book in 1897. He practically admitted\r\nthat the Anglophobia so common on the continent of Europe is the outcome\r\nof jealousy.[10] He acknowledged the proved superiority of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon over the Latin races, and he set himself to examine the\r\ncauses of that superiority. The general conclusion at which he arrived\r\nwas that the strength of the Anglo-Saxon race lay in the fact that its\r\nsociety, its government, and its habits of thought were eminently\r\n\"particularist,\" as opposed to the \"communitarian\" principles prevalent\r\non the continent of Europe. He was probably quite right. It has, indeed,\r\nbecome a commonplace of English political thought that for centuries\r\npast, from the days of Raleigh to those of Rhodes, the position of\r\nEngland in the world has been due more to the exertions, to the\r\nresources, and occasionally, perhaps, to the absence of scruple found in\r\nthe individual Anglo-Saxon, than to any encouragement or help derived\r\nfrom British Governments, whether of the Elizabethan, Georgian, or\r\nVictorian type. The principle of relying largely on individual effort\r\nhas, in truth, produced marvellous results. It is singularly suited to\r\ndevelop some of the best qualities of the vigorous, self-assertive\r\nAnglo-Saxon race. It is to be hoped that self-help may long continue to\r\nbe our national watchword.\r\n\r\nIt is now somewhat the fashion to regard as benighted the school of\r\nthought which was founded two hundred years ago by Du Quesnay and the\r\nFrench Physiocrates, which reached its zenith in the person of Adam\r\nSmith, and whose influence rapidly declined in England after the great\r\nbattle of Free Trade had been fought and won. But whatever may have been\r\nthe faults of that school, and however little its philosophy is capable\r\nof affording an answer to many of the complex questions which modern\r\ngovernment and society present, it laid fast hold of one unquestionably\r\nsound principle. It entertained a deep mistrust of Government\r\ninterference in the social and economic relations of life. Moreover, it\r\nsaw, long before the fact became apparent to the rest of the world,\r\nthat, in spite not only of some outward dissimilarities of methods but\r\neven of an instinctive mutual repulsion, despotic bureaucracy was the\r\nnatural ally of those communistic principles which the economists deemed\r\nit their main business in life to combat and condemn. Many regard with\r\nsome disquietude the frequent concessions which have of late years been\r\nmade in England to demands for State interference. Nevertheless, it is\r\nto be hoped that the main principle advocated by the economists still\r\nholds the field, that individualism is not being crushed out of\r\nexistence, and that the majority of our countrymen still believe that\r\nState interference--being an evil, although sometimes admittedly a\r\nnecessary evil--should be jealously watched and restricted to the\r\nminimum amount absolutely necessary in each special case.\r\n\r\nAttention is drawn to this point in order to show that the observations\r\nwhich follow are in no degree based on any general desire to exalt the\r\npower of the State at the expense of the individual.\r\n\r\nOur habits of thought, our past history, and our national character all,\r\ntherefore, point in the direction of allowing individualism as wide a\r\nscope as possible in the work of national expansion. Hence the career of\r\nthe East India Company and the tendency displayed more recently in\r\nAfrica to govern through the agency of private companies. On the other\r\nhand, it is greatly to be doubted whether the principles, which a wise\r\npolicy would dictate in the treatment of subject races, will receive\r\ntheir application to so full an extent at the hands of private\r\nindividuals as would be the case at the hands of the State. The\r\nguarantee for good government is even less solid where power is\r\nentrusted to a corporate body, for, as Turgot once said, \"La morale des\r\ncorps les plus scrupuleux ne vaut jamais celle des particuliers\r\nhonnêtes.\"[11] In both cases, public opinion is relatively impotent. In\r\nthe case of direct Government action, on the other hand, the views of\r\nthose who wish to uphold a high standard of public morality can find\r\nexpression in Parliament, and the latter can, if it chooses, oblige the\r\nGovernment to control its agents and call them to account for unjust,\r\nunwise, or overbearing conduct. More than this, State officials, having\r\nno interests to serve but those of good government, are more likely to\r\npay regard to the welfare of the subject race than commercial agents,\r\nwho must necessarily be hampered in their action by the pecuniary\r\ninterests of their employers.\r\n\r\nOur national policy must, of course, be what would be called in statics\r\nthe resultant of the various currents of opinion represented in our\r\nnational society. Whether Imperialism will continue to rest on a sound\r\nbasis depends, therefore, to no small extent, on the degree to which\r\nthe moralising elements in the nation can, without injury to all that\r\nis sound and healthy in individualist action, control those defects\r\nwhich may not improbably spring out of the egotism of the commercial\r\nspirit, if it be subject to no effective check.[12]\r\n\r\nIf this problem can be satisfactorily solved, then Christianity, far\r\nfrom being a disruptive force, as was the case with Rome, will prove one\r\nof the strongest elements of Imperial cohesion.\r\n\r\n3. _Slavery._--It is not necessary to discuss this question, for there\r\ncan be no doubt that, in so far as his connexion with subject races is\r\nconcerned, the Anglo-Saxon in modern times comes, not to enslave, but to\r\nliberate from slavery. The fact that he does so is, indeed, one of his\r\nbest title-deeds to Imperial dominion.\r\n\r\n4. _The Pauperisation of the Roman Proletariat._--This is the _Panem et\r\nCircenses_ policy. Mr. Hodgkin appears to think that in this direction\r\nlies the main danger which threatens the British Empire.\r\n\r\n     \"Of all the forces,\" he says, \"which were at work for the\r\n     destruction of the prosperity of the Roman world, none is more\r\n     deserving of the careful study of an English statesman than the\r\n     grain-largesses to the populace of Rome.... Will the great\r\n     Democracies of the twentieth century resist the temptation to use\r\n     political power as a means of material self-enrichment?\"\r\n\r\nPossibly Mr. Hodgkin is right. The manner in which the leaders of the\r\nParis Commune dealt with the rights of property during their disastrous,\r\nbut fortunately very brief, period of office in 1871, serves as a\r\nwarning of what, in an extreme case, may be expected of despotic\r\ndemocracy in its most aggravated form. Moreover, misgovernment, and the\r\nfiscal oppression which is the almost necessary accompaniment of\r\nmilitarism dominant over a poverty-stricken population, have latterly\r\ndeveloped on the continent of Europe, and more especially in Italy, a\r\nschool of action--for anarchism can scarcely be dignified by the name of\r\na school of thought--which regards human life as scarcely more sacred\r\nthan property. It may be that some lower depth has yet to be reached,\r\nalthough it is almost inconceivable that such should be the case.\r\nAnarchy takes us past the stage of any defined political or social\r\nprogramme. It would appear, so far as can at present be judged, to\r\nembody the last despairing cry of ultra-democracy \"Furens.\"\r\n\r\nIt is permissible to hope that our national sobriety, coupled with the\r\ninherited traditions derived from centuries of free government, will\r\nsave us from such extreme manifestations of democratic tyranny as those\r\nto which allusion has been made above. The special danger in England\r\nwould appear rather to arise from the probability of gradual dry rot,\r\ndue to prolonged offence against the infallible and relentless laws of\r\neconomic science. Both British employers of labour and British workmen\r\nare insular in their habits of thought, and insular in the range of\r\ntheir acquired knowledge. They do not appear as yet to be thoroughly\r\nalive to the new position created for British trade by foreign\r\ncompetition. It is greatly to be hoped that they will awake to the\r\nrealities of the situation before any permanent harm is done to British\r\ntrade, for the loss of trade involves as its ultimate result the\r\npauperisation of the proletariat, the adoption of reckless expedients\r\nbased on the _Panem et Circenses_ policy to fill the mouths and quell\r\nthe voices of the multitude, and finally the suicide of that Empire\r\nwhich is the offspring of trade, and which can only continue to exist so\r\nlong as its parent continues to thrive and to flourish.\r\n\r\n5. _The Destruction of the Middle Class by the Fiscal Oppression of the\r\nCuriales._--Leaving aside points of detail, which were only of special\r\napplication to the circumstances of the time, this cause of Roman decay\r\nmay, for all purposes of comparison and instruction, be stated in the\r\nfollowing terms: funds, which should have been spent by the\r\nmunicipalities on local objects, were, from about the close of the third\r\ncentury, diverted to the Imperial Exchequer, by which they were not\r\ninfrequently squandered in such a manner as to confer no benefit of any\r\nkind on the taxpayers, whether local or Imperial. Thus, the system of\r\nlocal self-government, which, Mr. Hodgkin says, was, during the early\r\ncenturies of the Empire, \"both in name and fact Republican,\" was\r\nshattered.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear probable that an attempt will ever be made to divert\r\nthe public revenues of the outlying dependencies of Great Britain to the\r\nImperial Exchequer. The lesson taught by the loss of the American\r\nColonies has sunk deeply into the public mind. Moreover, the example of\r\nSpain stands as a warning to all the world. The principle that local\r\nrevenues should be expended locally has become part of the political\r\ncreed of Englishmen; neither is it at all likely to be infringed, even\r\nin respect to those dependencies whose rights and privileges are not\r\nsafeguarded by self-governing institutions.\r\n\r\nThere may, however, be some little danger ahead in a sense exactly\r\nopposite to that which was incurred by Rome--the danger, that is to\r\nsay, that, under the pressure of Imperialism, backed by influential\r\nclass and personal interests, too large an amount of the Imperial\r\nrevenue may be diverted to the outlying dependencies. If this were done,\r\ntwo evils might not improbably ensue.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the British democracy might become restive under\r\ntaxation imposed for objects the utility of which would not perhaps be\r\nfully appreciated, and might therefore be disposed to cast off too\r\nhastily the mantle of Imperialism. It is but a short time ago that an\r\ninfluential school of politicians persistently dwelt on the theme that\r\nthe colonies were a burthen to the Mother Country. Although, for the\r\ntime being, views of this sort are out of fashion, no assurance can be\r\nfelt that the swing of the pendulum may not bring round another\r\nanti-Imperialist phase of public opinion.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, if financial aid to any considerable extent were\r\nafforded by the British Treasury to the outlying dependencies, a serious\r\nrisk would be run that this concession would be followed at no distant\r\nperiod by a plea in favour of financial control from England. The\r\nestablishment of this latter principle would strike a blow at one of the\r\nmain props on which our Imperial fabric is based. It would tend to\r\nsubstitute a centralised, in the place of our present decentralised\r\nsystem. Those who are immediately responsible for the administration of\r\nour outlying dependencies will, therefore, act wisely if they abstain\r\nfrom asking too readily for Imperial pecuniary aid in order to solve\r\nlocal difficulties.\r\n\r\nThese considerations naturally lead to some reflections on the\r\nprinciples of government adopted in those dependencies of the Empire,\r\nthe inhabitants of which are not of the Anglo-Saxon race. Colonies whose\r\ninhabitants are mainly of British origin stand, of course, on a wholly\r\ndifferent footing. They carry their Anglo-Saxon institutions and habits\r\nof thought with them to their distant homes.\r\n\r\nEnglishmen are less imitative than most Europeans in this sense--that\r\nthey are less disposed to apply the administrative and political systems\r\nof their own country to the government of backward populations; but in\r\nspite of their relatively high degree of political elasticity, they\r\ncannot shake themselves altogether free from political\r\nconventionalities. Moreover, the experienced minority is constantly\r\nbeing pressed by the inexperienced majority in the direction of\r\nimitation. Knowing the somewhat excessive degree of adulation which some\r\nsections of the British public are disposed to pay to their special\r\nidol, Lord Dufferin, in 1883, was almost apologetic to his countrymen\r\nfor abstaining from an act of political folly. He pleaded strenuously\r\nfor delay in the introduction of parliamentary institutions into Egypt,\r\non the ground that our attempts \"to mitigate predominant absolutism\" in\r\nIndia had been slow, hesitating, and tentative. He brought poetic\r\nmetaphor to his aid. He deprecated paying too much attention to the\r\n\"murmuring leaves,\" in other words, imagining that the establishment of\r\na Chamber of Notables implied constitutional freedom, and he exhorted\r\nhis countrymen \"to seek for the roots,\" that is to say, to allow each\r\nEgyptian village to elect its own mayor (Sheikh).\r\n\r\nIt cannot be too clearly understood that whether we deal with the roots,\r\nor the trunk, or the branches, or the leaves, free institutions in the\r\nfull sense of the term must for generations to come be wholly unsuitable\r\nto countries such as India and Egypt. If the use of a metaphor, though\r\nof a less polished type, be allowed, it may be said that it will\r\nprobably never be possible to make a Western silk purse out of an\r\nEastern sow's ear; at all events, if the impossibility of the task be\r\ncalled in question, it should be recognised that the process of\r\nmanufacture will be extremely lengthy and tedious.\r\n\r\nBut it is often urged that, although no rational person would wish to\r\nadvocate the premature creation of ultra-liberal institutions in\r\nbackward countries, at the same time that for several reasons it is\r\ndesirable to move gradually in this direction. The adoption of this\r\nmethod is, it is said, the only way to remedy the evils attendant on a\r\nsystem of personal government in an extreme form; it enables us to learn\r\nthe views of the natives of the country, even although we may not accord\r\nto the latter full power of deciding whether or not those views should\r\nbe put in practice; lastly, it constitutes a means of political\r\neducation, through the agency of which the subject race will gradually\r\nacquire the qualities necessary to autonomy.\r\n\r\nThe force of these arguments cannot be denied, but there should be no\r\ndelusion as to the weight which should be attached to them. It has been\r\nvery truly remarked by a writer, who has dealt with the idiosyncrasies\r\nof a singularly versatile nation, whose genius presented in every\r\nrespect a marked contrast to that of Eastern races, that from the dawn\r\nof history Eastern politics have been \"stricken with a fatal\r\nsimplicity.\"[13] Do not let us for one moment imagine that the fatally\r\nsimple idea of despotic rule will readily give way to the far more\r\ncomplex conception of ordered liberty. The transformation, if it ever\r\ntakes place at all, will probably be the work, not of generations, but\r\nof centuries.\r\n\r\nSo limited is the stock of political ideas in the world that some\r\nmodified copy of parliamentary institutions is, without doubt, the only\r\nmethod which has yet been invented for mitigating the evils attendant on\r\nthe personal system of government. But it is a method which is\r\nthoroughly uncongenial to Oriental habits of thought. It may be doubted\r\nwhether, by the adoption of this exotic system, we gain any real insight\r\ninto native aspirations and opinions. As to the educational process, the\r\nexperience of India is not very encouraging. The good government of most\r\nIndian towns depends to this day mainly, not on the Municipal\r\nCommissioners, who are generally natives, but on the influence of the\r\nPresident, who is usually an Englishman.\r\n\r\nA further consideration in connection with this point is also of some\r\nimportance. It is that British officials in Eastern countries should be\r\nencouraged by all possible means to learn the views and the requirements\r\nof the native population. The establishment of mock parliaments tends\r\nrather in the opposite direction, for the official on the spot sees\r\nthrough the mockery and is not infrequently disposed to abandon any\r\nattempt to ascertain real native opinion, through disgust at the\r\nunreality, crudity, or folly of the views set forth by the putative\r\nrepresentatives of native society.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons it is important that, in our well-intentioned\r\nendeavours to impregnate the Oriental mind with our insular habits of\r\nthought, we should proceed with the utmost caution, and that we should\r\nremember that our primary duty is, not to introduce a system which,\r\nunder the specious cloak of free institutions, will enable a small\r\nminority of natives to misgovern their countrymen, but to establish one\r\nwhich will enable the mass of the population to be governed according to\r\nthe code of Christian morality. A freely elected Egyptian Parliament,\r\nsupposing such a thing to be possible, would not improbably legislate\r\nfor the protection of the slave-owner, if not the slave-dealer, and no\r\nassurance can be felt that the electors of Rajputana, if they had their\r\nown way, would not re-establish suttee. Good government has the merit of\r\npresenting a more or less attainable ideal. Before Orientals can attain\r\nanything approaching to the British ideal of self-government they will\r\nhave to undergo very numerous transmigrations of political thought.\r\n\r\nThe question of local self-government may be considered from another,\r\nand almost equally important point of view.\r\n\r\nWhen writers such as M. Demolins speak of the \"particularist\" system of\r\nEngland and of the \"communitarian\" system prevalent on the continent of\r\nEurope, they generally mean to contrast the British plan of acting\r\nthrough the agency of private individuals with the Continental practice\r\nof relying almost entirely on the action of the State. This is the\r\nprimary and perhaps the most important signification of the two phrases,\r\nbut the principles which these phrases are intended to represent admit\r\nof another application.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for those Englishmen who have not been brought into\r\nbusiness relations with Continental officials to realise the extreme\r\ncentralisation of their administrative and diplomatic procedures. The\r\ntendency of every French central authority is to allow no discretionary\r\npower whatever to his subordinate. He wishes, often from a distance, to\r\ncontrol every detail of the administration. The tendency of the\r\nsubordinate, on the other hand, is to lean in everything on superior\r\nauthority. He does not dare to take any personal responsibility; indeed,\r\nit is possible to go further and say that the corroding action of\r\nbureaucracy renders those who live under its baneful shadow almost\r\nincapable of assuming responsibility. By force of habit and training it\r\nhas become irksome to them. They fly for refuge to a superior official,\r\nwho, in his turn, if the case at all admits of the adoption of such a\r\ncourse, hastens to merge his individuality in the voluminous pages of a\r\ncode or a Government circular.\r\n\r\nThe British official, on the other hand, whether in England or abroad,\r\nis an Englishman first and an official afterwards. He possesses his full\r\nshare of national characteristics. He is by inheritance an\r\nindividualist. He lives in a society which, so far from being, as is the\r\ncase on the Continent, saturated with respect for officialism, is\r\nsomewhat prone to regard officialism and incompetency as synonymous\r\nterms. By such association, any bureaucratic tendency which may exist on\r\nthe part of the British official is kept in check, whilst his\r\nindividualism is subjected to a sustained and healthy course of tonic\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nThus, the British system breeds a race of officials who relatively to\r\nthose holding analogous posts on the Continent, are disposed to exercise\r\ntheir central authority in a manner sympathetic to individualism; who,\r\nif they are inclined to err in the sense of over-centralisation, are\r\noften held in check by statesmen imbued with the decentralising spirit;\r\nand who, under these influences, are inclined to accord to local agents\r\na far wider latitude than those trained in the Continental school of\r\nbureaucracy would consider either safe or desirable.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, looking to the position and attributes of the local\r\nagents themselves, it is singular to observe how the habit of assuming\r\nresponsibility, coupled with national predispositions acting in the same\r\ndirection, generates and fosters a capacity for the beneficial exercise\r\nof power. This feature is not merely noticeable in comparing British\r\nwith Continental officials, but also in contrasting various classes of\r\nEnglishmen _inter se_. The most highly centralised of all our English\r\noffices is the War Office. For this reason, and also because a military\r\nlife necessarily and rightly engenders a habit of implicit obedience to\r\norders, soldiers are generally less disposed than civilians to assume\r\npersonal responsibility and to act on their own initiative.\r\nNevertheless, whether in military or civil life, it may be said that the\r\nspirit of decentralisation pervades the whole British administrative\r\nsystem, and that it has given birth to a class of officials who have\r\nboth the desire and the capacity to govern, who constitute what Bacon\r\ncalled[14] the _Participes curarum_, namely, \"those upon whom Princes\r\ndoe discharge the greatest weight of their affaires,\" and who are\r\ninstruments of incomparable value in the execution of a policy of\r\nImperialism.\r\n\r\nThe method of exercising the central control under the British system\r\ncalls for some further remarks. It varies greatly in different\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nUnder the Indian system a council of experts is attached to the\r\nSecretary of State in England. A good authority on this subject says[15]\r\nthat there can be no question of the advantage of this system.\r\n\r\n     No man, however experienced and laborious, could properly direct\r\n     and control the various interests of so vast an Empire, unless he\r\n     were aided by men with knowledge of different parts of the country,\r\n     and possessing an intimate acquaintance with the different and\r\n     complicated subjects involved in the government and welfare of so\r\n     many incongruous races.\r\n\r\nOn the assumption that India is to be governed from London, there can be\r\nno doubt of the validity of this argument. But, as has been frequently\r\npointed out,[16] this system tends inevitably towards\r\nover-centralisation, and if the British Government is to continue to\r\nexercise a sort of πανκρατορία to use an expressive Greek phrase, over a\r\nnumber of outlying dependencies of very various types,\r\nover-centralisation is a danger which should be carefully shunned. It is\r\nwiser to obtain local knowledge from those on the spot, rather than from\r\nthose whose local experience must necessarily diminish in value in\r\ndirect proportion to the length of the period during which they have\r\nbeen absent from the special locality, and who, moreover, are under a\r\nstrong temptation, after they leave the dependency, to exercise a\r\ndetailed control over their successors. It is greatly to be doubted,\r\ntherefore, whether, should the occasion arise, this portion of the\r\nIndian system is deserving of reproduction.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another portion of that system which is in every\r\nrespect admirable, and the creation of which bears the impress of that\r\nkeen political insight which, according to many Continental authorities,\r\nis the birthright of the Anglo-Saxon race. India is governed locally by\r\na council composed mainly of officials who have passed their adult lives\r\nin the country; but the Viceroy, and occasionally the legal and\r\nfinancial members of Council, are sent from England and are usually\r\nchosen by reason of their general qualifications, rather than on account\r\nof any special knowledge of Indian affairs. This system avoids the\r\ndangers consequent on over-centralisation, whilst at the same time it\r\nassociates with the administration of the country some individuals who\r\nare personally imbued with the general principles of government which\r\nare favoured by the central authority. Its tendency is to correct the\r\ndefect from which the officials employed in the outlying portions of the\r\nEmpire are most likely to suffer, namely, that of magnifying the\r\nimportance of some local event or consideration, and of unduly\r\nneglecting arguments based on considerations of wider Imperial import.\r\nIt enhances the idea of proportion, which is one of the main qualities\r\nnecessary to any politician or governing body. Long attention to one\r\nsubject, or group of subjects, is apt to narrow the vision of\r\nspecialists. The adjunct of an element, which is not Anglo-Indian, to\r\nthe Indian Government acts as a corrective to this evil. The members of\r\nthe Government who are sent from England, if they have no local\r\nexperience, are at all events exempt from local prejudices. They bring\r\nto bear on the questions which come before them a wide general knowledge\r\nand, in many cases, the liberal spirit and vigorous common sense which\r\nare acquired in the course of an English parliamentary career.\r\n\r\nIt may be added, as a matter of important detail, that it would be\r\ndesirable, in order to give continuity to Indian policy, to select young\r\nmen to fill the place of Viceroy, and to extend the period of office\r\nfrom five to seven, or even to ten years.\r\n\r\nAlthough over-centralisation is to be avoided, a certain amount of\r\ncontrol from a central authority is not only unavoidable; if properly\r\nexercised, it is most beneficial. One danger to which the local agent\r\nis exposed is that, being ill-informed of circumstances lying outside\r\nhis range of political vision, he may lose sight of the general\r\nprinciples which guide the policy of the Empire; he may treat subjects\r\nof local interest in a manner calculated to damage, or even to\r\njeopardise, Imperial interests. The central authority is in a position\r\nto obviate any danger arising from this cause. To ensure the harmonious\r\nworking of the different parts of the machine, the central authority\r\nshould endeavour, so far as is possible, to realise the circumstances\r\nattendant on the government of the dependency; whilst the local agent\r\nshould be constantly on the watch lest he should overrate the importance\r\nof some local issue, or fail to appreciate fully the difficulties which\r\nbeset the action of the central authority.\r\n\r\nTo sum up all that there is to be said on this branch of the subject, it\r\nmay be hoped that the fate which befell Rome, in so far as it was due to\r\nthe special causes of decay now under consideration, may be averted by\r\nclose adherence to two important principles. The first of these\r\nprinciples is that local revenues should be expended locally. The second\r\nis that over-centralisation should above all things be avoided. This may\r\nbe done either by the creation of self-governing institutions in those\r\ndependencies whose civilisation is sufficiently advanced to justify the\r\nadoption of this course; or by decentralising the executive Government\r\nin cases where self-government, in the ordinary acceptation of the term,\r\nis impossible or undesirable.\r\n\r\n6. _Barbarous Finance._--Mr. Hodgkin says that the system of Imperial\r\ntaxation under the Roman Empire was \"wasteful, oppressive, and in a\r\nword, barbarous.\" He gives, as an instance in point, the Roman\r\nIndiction. This was the name given to the system under which the taxable\r\nvalue of the land throughout the Empire was reassessed every fifteen\r\nyears. At each reassessment, Mr. Hodgkin says, \"the few who had\r\nprospered found themselves assessed on the higher value which their\r\nlands had acquired, while the many who were sinking down into poverty\r\nobtained, it is to be feared, but little relief from taxation on account\r\nof the higher rate which was charged to all.\"\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat unpleasant to reflect that the system which Mr. Hodgkin\r\nso strongly condemns, and which he even regards as one of the causes of\r\nthe downfall of the Roman Empire, is--save in respect to the intervals\r\nof periodical reassessment--very similar to that which exists everywhere\r\nin India, except in the province of Bengal, where the rights conferred\r\non the zemindars under Lord Cornwallis's Permanent Settlement are still\r\nrespected in spite of occasional unwise suggestions that time and the\r\nfall in the value of the rupee have obliterated any moral obligations to\r\nmaintain them. Nor are the results obtained in India altogether\r\ndissimilar from those observable under Roman rule. The knowledge that\r\nreassessment was imminent has, it is believed, often discouraged the\r\noutlay of private capital on improving the land. More than this, it is\r\nnotorious that, at one time, some provinces suffered greatly from the\r\nmistakes made by the settlement officers. These latter were animated\r\nwith the best intentions, but, in spite of their marked ability--for\r\nthey were all specially selected men--they often found the task\r\nentrusted to them impossible of execution. Unfortunately political or\r\nadministrative errors cannot be condoned by reason of good intentions.\r\nLike the Greeks of old, the natives of India suffer from the mistakes of\r\ntheir rulers.\r\n\r\nThe intentions of the British, as compared with the Roman Government\r\nare, however, noteworthy from one point of view, inasmuch as from a\r\ncorrect appreciation of those intentions it is possible to evolve a\r\nprinciple perhaps in some degree calculated to avert the consequences\r\nwhich befell Rome, partly by reason of fiscal errors.\r\n\r\nIn spite of some high-sounding commonplaces which were at times\r\nenunciated by Roman lawgivers and statesmen, and in which a ring of\r\nutilitarian philosophy is to be recognised,[17] and of the further fact\r\nthat, as in the case of Verres, a check was sometimes applied to the\r\nexcesses of local Governors, it is almost certainly true that the rulers\r\nof Rome did not habitually act on the recognition of any very strong\r\nmoral obligation binding on the Imperial Government in its treatment of\r\nsubject races. The merits of any fiscal system were probably judged\r\nmainly from the point of view of the amount of funds which it poured\r\ninto the Treasury. The fiscal principles on which the Emperors of Rome\r\nacted survived long after the fall of the Roman Empire. They deserve the\r\nepithet of \"barbarous\" which Mr. Hodgkin has bestowed upon them.\r\n\r\nThe point of departure of the British Government is altogether\r\ndifferent. Its intentions are admirable. Every farthing which has been\r\nspent--and, it may be feared, often wasted--on the numerous military\r\nexpeditions in which the Government of India has been engaged during the\r\nlast century would, in the eyes of many, certainly be considered as\r\nexpenditure incurred on objects which were of paramount interest to the\r\nIndian taxpayers. Moreover, a whole category of British legislation\r\nconnected with fiscal matters has been undertaken, not so much with a\r\nview to increase the revenue as with the object of distributing the\r\nburthen of taxation equally amongst the different classes of society.\r\nMuch of this legislation has been perfectly justifiable and even\r\nbeneficial. Nevertheless, it should never be forgotten that it is\r\ngenerally based on the purely Western principle that abstract justice is\r\nin itself a desirable thing to attain, and that a fiscal or\r\nadministrative system stands condemned if it is wanting in symmetry. It\r\nwas against any extreme application of this principle that Burke\r\ndirected some of his most forcible diatribes.[18] It has been already\r\npointed out that the commendable want of intellectual symmetry which is\r\nthe inherited possession of the Englishman gives him a very great\r\nadvantage as an Imperialist agent over those trained in the rigid and\r\nbureaucratic school of Continental Europe. But the Englishman is a\r\nWestern, albeit an Anglo-Saxon Western, and, from the point of view of\r\nall processes of reasoning, the gulf which separates any one member of\r\nthe European family from another is infinitely less wide than that which\r\ndivides all Westerns from all Orientals. Even the Englishman, therefore,\r\nis constrained--sometimes much against his will--to bow down in that\r\ntemple of Logic, the existence of which the Oriental is disposed\r\naltogether to ignore. Indeed, sometimes the choice lies between the\r\nenforcement on the reluctant Oriental of principles based on\r\nlogic--occasionally on the very simple science of arithmetic--or\r\nabandoning the work of civilisation altogether. From this point of view,\r\nthe dangers to which the British Empire is exposed by reason of fiscal\r\nmeasures are due not, as was the case with Rome, to barbarous, but\r\nrather to ultra-scientific finance. The following is a case in point.\r\n\r\nThe land-tax has always been the principal source from which Oriental\r\npotentates have derived their revenues. For all practical purposes it\r\nmay be said that the system which they have adopted has generally been\r\nto take as much from the cultivators as they could get. Reformers, such\r\nas the Emperor Akbar, have at times endeavoured to introduce more\r\nenlightened methods of taxation, and to carry into practice the\r\ntheories upon which the fiscal system in all Moslem countries is based.\r\nThose theories are by no means so objectionable as is often supposed.\r\nBut the reforms which some few capable rulers attempted to introduce\r\nhave almost always crumbled away under the régime of their\r\nsuccessors.[19] In practice, the only limit to the demands of the ruler\r\nof an Oriental State has been the ability of the taxpayers to satisfy\r\nthem.[20] The only defence of the taxpayers has lain in the concealment\r\nof their incomes at the risk of being tortured till they divulged their\r\namount.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, even under such a system as this, the wind is tempered to\r\nthe shorn lamb by the fact that Oriental rulers recognise that they\r\ncannot get money from a man who possesses none. If, from drought or\r\nother causes, the cultivator raises no crop, he is not required to pay\r\nany land-tax. The idea of expropriation for the non-payment of taxes is\r\npurely Western and modern. Under Roman law, it was the rule in contracts\r\nfor rent that a tenant was not bound to pay if any _vis major_ prevented\r\nhim from reaping.\r\n\r\nThe European system is very different. A far less heavy demand is made\r\non the cultivator, but he is, at all events in principle and sometimes\r\nin practice, called upon to meet it in good and bad years alike. He is\r\nexpected to save in years of plenty in order to make good the deficit in\r\nlean years. If he is unable to pay, he is liable to be expropriated, and\r\nhe often is expropriated. This plan is just, logical, and very Western.\r\nIt may be questioned whether Oriental cultivators do not sometimes\r\nrather prefer the oppression and elasticity of the Eastern to the\r\njustice and rigidity of the Western system.\r\n\r\nVarious palliatives have been adopted in India with a view to giving\r\nsome elasticity to the working of the Land Revenue system. In Egypt,\r\nwhere the administration is much less Anglicised than in India, and\r\nwhere, for various reasons, the treatment of this subject presents\r\nrelatively fewer difficulties, it is the practice now, as was the case\r\nunder purely native rule, to remit the taxes on what is known as\r\n_Sharaki_ lands, that is to say, land which, owing to a low Nile, has\r\nnot been irrigated. It is not, however, necessary to dwell on the\r\ndetails of this subject. It will be sufficient to draw attention to the\r\ndifferent points of view from which the Eastern and the Western approach\r\nthe subject of fiscal administration. The latter urges with unanswerable\r\nlogic that financial equilibrium must be maintained, and that he cannot\r\nframe a trustworthy Budget unless he knows the amount he may count on\r\nreceiving from direct taxes, especially from the land-tax. The Eastern\r\nreplies that he knows nothing of either financial equilibrium or of\r\nbudgets, that it has, indeed, from time immemorial been the custom to\r\nleave him nought but a bare pittance when he had money, but to refrain\r\nfrom any endeavours to extort money from him when he had none.\r\n\r\nAnother instance drawn, not from the practices of fiscal administration,\r\nbut from legislation on a cognate subject, may be cited.\r\n\r\nDirectly Western civilisation comes in contact with a backward Oriental\r\nSociety, the relations between debtor and creditor are entirely changed.\r\nA social revolution is effected. The Western applies his code with stern\r\nand ruthless logic. The child-like Eastern, on the other hand, cannot be\r\nmade to understand that his house should be sold over his head because\r\nhe affixed his seal to a document, which, very probably, he had never\r\nread, or, at all events, had never fully understood, and which was\r\npresented to him by a man at one time apparently animated with\r\nbenevolent intentions, inasmuch as he wished to lend him money, but who\r\nsubsequently showed his malevolence by asking to be repaid his loan with\r\ninterest at an exorbitant rate.\r\n\r\nHere, again, many palliatives have been suggested and some have been\r\napplied, but many of them sin against the economic law, which provides\r\nthat legislation intended to protect a man against the consequences of\r\nhis own folly or improvidence is generally unproductive of result.\r\n\r\nIn truth, no thoroughly effective remedy can be applied in cases such as\r\nthose mentioned above, without abandoning all real attempt at progress.\r\nCivilisation must, unfortunately, have its victims, amongst whom are to\r\nsome extent inevitably numbered those who do not recognise the paramount\r\nnecessities of the Budget system, and those who contract debts with an\r\ninadequate appreciation of the _caveat emptor_ principle. Nevertheless,\r\nthe Western financier will act wisely if, casting aside some portion of\r\nhis Western habit of thought, he recognises the facts with which he has\r\nto deal, and if, fully appreciating the intimate connection between\r\nfinance and politics in an Eastern country, he endeavours, so far as is\r\npossible, to temper the clean-cut science of his fiscal measures in such\r\na manner as to suit the customs and intellectual standard of the subject\r\nrace with which he has to deal.\r\n\r\nThe question of the amount of taxation levied stands apart from the\r\nmethod of its imposition. It may be laid down as a principle of\r\nuniversal application that high taxation is incompatible with assured\r\nstability of Imperial rule.[21]\r\n\r\nThe financier and the hydraulic engineer, who is a powerful ally of the\r\nfinancier, have probably a greater potentiality of creating an\r\nartificial and self-interested loyalty than even the judge. The reasons\r\nare obvious. In the first place, the number of criminals, or even of\r\ncivil litigants, in any society is limited; whereas practically the\r\nwhole population consists of taxpayers. In the second place, the\r\narbitrary methods of administering justice practised by Oriental rulers\r\ndo not shock their subjects nearly so much as Europeans are often\r\ndisposed to think. Custom has made it in them a property of easiness.\r\nThey often, indeed, fail to appreciate the intentions, and are disposed\r\nto resent the methods, of those whose object it is to establish justice\r\nin the law-courts. On the other hand, the most ignorant Egyptian fellah\r\nor Indian ryot can understand the difference between a Government which\r\ntakes nine-tenths of his crop in the shape of land-tax, and one which\r\nonly takes one-third or one-fourth. He can realise that he is better off\r\nif the water is allowed to flow periodically on to his fields, than he\r\nwas when the influential landowner, who possessed a property up-stream\r\non the canal, made a dam and prevented him from getting any water at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThese principles would probably meet with general acceptance from all\r\nwho have considered the question of Imperial rule. They are, indeed,\r\nalmost commonplace. Unfortunately, in practice the necessity of\r\nconforming to them is often forgotten. India is the great instance in\r\npoint. Englishmen are often so convinced that the natives of India ought\r\nto be loyal, they hear so much said of their loyalty, they appreciate so\r\nlittle the causes which are at work to produce disloyalty, and, in spite\r\nof occasional mistakes due to errors of judgment, they are in reality so\r\nearnestly desirous of doing what they consider, sometimes perhaps\r\nerroneously, their duty towards the native population, that they are apt\r\nto lose sight of the fact that the self-interest of the subject race is\r\nthe principal basis of the whole Imperial fabric. They forget, whilst\r\nthey are adding to the upper story of the house, that the foundations\r\nmay give way.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to enter into any lengthy discussion upon Indian\r\naffairs. It may be said, however, that the Indian history of the last\r\nfew years certainly gives cause for some anxiety. Attention was at one\r\ntime too exclusively paid to frontier policy, which constitutes only\r\none, and that not the most important, element of the complex Indian\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nThat the policy of \"masterly inactivity,\" to use the phrase\r\nepigrammatically, but perhaps somewhat incorrectly, applied to the line\r\nof action advocated by Lord Lawrence in 1869, required some\r\nmodifications as the onward movement of Russia in Asia developed, will\r\nscarcely be contested by the most devoted of Lawrentian partisans and\r\nfollowers. That those modifications were wisely introduced is a\r\nproposition the truth of which it is difficult to admit. The portion of\r\nLord Lawrence's programme which was necessarily temporary, inasmuch as\r\nit depended on the circumstances of the time, was rejected without\r\ntaking sufficient account of the further and far more important portion\r\nwhich was of permanent application. This latter portion was defined in\r\nan historic and oft-quoted despatch which he indited on the eve of his\r\ndeparture from India, and which may be regarded as his political\r\ntestament. In this despatch, Lord Lawrence, speaking with all the\r\nauthority due to a lifelong acquaintance with Indian affairs, laid down\r\nthe broad general principle that the strongest security of our rule lay\r\n\"in the contentment, if not in the attachment, of the masses.\"[22] The\r\ntruth of this general principle was at one time too much neglected.\r\nUnder the influence of a predominant militarism acting on too pliant\r\npoliticians, vast military expenditure was incurred. Territory lying\r\noutside the natural geographical frontier of India was occupied, the\r\nacquisition of which was condemned not merely by sound policy, but also\r\nby sound strategy. Taxation was increased, and, generally, the material\r\ninterests of the natives of India were sacrificed and British Imperial\r\nrule exposed to subsequent danger, in order to satisfy the exigencies of\r\na school of soldier-politicians who only saw one, and that the most\r\ntechnical, aspect of a very wide and complex question.\r\n\r\nNeither, unfortunately, is there any sure guarantee that the mistakes,\r\nwhich it is now almost universally admitted were made, will not recur.\r\nWhere, indeed, are we to look for any effective check? The rulers of\r\nIndia, whether they sit in Calcutta or London, may again be carried away\r\nby the partial views of an influential class, or of a few masterful\r\nindividuals. It is absurd to speak of creating free institutions in\r\nIndia to control the Indian Government. Experience has shown that\r\nparliamentary action in England not infrequently degenerates into\r\nacrimonious discussion and recrimination dictated by party passion; in\r\nany case, it is generally too late to change the course of events. Still\r\nless reliance can be placed on the action of the British Press, which\r\nfalls a ready victim to the specious arguments advanced by some\r\nstrategical pseudo-Imperialist in high position, or by some fervent\r\nacolyte who has learnt at the feet of his master the fatal and facile\r\nlesson of how an Empire, built up by statesmen, may be wrecked by the\r\nwell-intentioned but mistaken measures recommended by specialists to\r\nensure Imperial salvation. The managers of the London newspapers afford,\r\nindeed, be it said to their credit, every facility for the publication\r\nof views adverse to those which they themselves advocate. But it is none\r\nthe less true that, during the years when the unwise frontier policy of\r\na few years ago was being planned and executed, the voices of the\r\nopposition, although they were those of Indian statesmen and officials\r\nwho could speak with the highest authority, failed to obtain an adequate\r\nhearing until the evil was irremediable. On the other hand, the views of\r\nthe strategical specialists went abroad over the land, with the result\r\nthat ill-informed and careless public opinion followed their advice\r\nwithout having any very precise idea of whither it was being led.\r\n\r\nIt would appear, therefore, that there is need for great care and\r\nwatchfulness in the management of Indian affairs. That same\r\ninconsistency of character and absence of definite aim, which are such\r\nnotable Anglo-Saxon qualities and which adapt themselves so admirably to\r\nthe requirements of Imperial rule, may in some respects constitute an\r\nadditional danger. If we are not to adopt a policy based on securing the\r\ncontentment of the subject race by ministering to their material\r\ninterests, we must of necessity make a distinct approach to the\r\ncounter-policy of governing by the sword alone. In that case, it would\r\nbe as well not to allow a free native Press, or to encourage high\r\neducation. Any repressive or retrograde measures in either of these\r\ndirections would, without doubt, meet with strong and, to a great\r\nextent, reasonable opposition in England. A large section of the public,\r\nforgetful of the fact that they had stood passively by whilst measures,\r\nsuch as the imposition of increased taxes, which the natives of India\r\nreally resent, were adopted, would protest loudly against the adoption\r\nof other measures which are, indeed, open to objection, but which\r\nnevertheless touch Oriental in a far less degree than they affect\r\nWestern public feeling. The result of this inconsistency is that our\r\npresent system rather tends to turn out demagogues from our colleges, to\r\ngive them every facility for sowing their subversive views broadcast\r\nover the land, and at the same time to prepare the ground for the\r\nreception of the seed which they sow. Now this is the very reverse of a\r\nsound Imperial policy. We cannot, it is true, effectually prevent the\r\nmanufacture of demagogues without adopting measures which would render\r\nus false to our acknowledged principles of government and to our\r\ncivilising mission. But we may govern in such a manner as to give the\r\ndemagogue no fulcrum with which to move his credulous and ill-informed\r\ncountrymen and co-religionists. The leading principle of a government of\r\nthis nature should be that low taxation is the most potent instrument\r\nwith which to conjure discontent. This is the policy which will tend\r\nmore than any other to the stability of Imperial rule. If it is to be\r\nadopted, two elements of British society will have to be kept in check\r\nat the hands of the statesman acting in concert with the moralist. These\r\nare Militarism and Commercial Egotism. The Empire depends in a great\r\ndegree on the strength and efficiency of its army. It thrives on its\r\ncommerce. But if the soldier and the trader are not kept under some\r\ndegree of statesmanlike control, they are capable of becoming the most\r\nformidable, though unconscious, enemies of the British Empire.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, therefore, that though there are some disquieting\r\ncircumstances attendant on our Imperial rule, the general result of an\r\nexamination into the causes which led to the collapse of Roman power,\r\nand a comparison of those causes with the principles on which the\r\nBritish Empire is governed, are, on the whole, encouraging. To every\r\ndanger which threatens there is a safeguard. To every portion of the\r\nbody politic in which symptoms of disease may occur, it is possible to\r\napply a remedy.\r\n\r\nChristianity is our most powerful ally. We are the sworn enemies of the\r\nslave-dealer and the slave-owner. The dangers arising from the possible\r\npauperisation of the proletariat may, it is to be hoped, be averted by\r\nour national character and by the natural play of our time-honoured\r\ninstitutions. If we adhere steadily to the principle that local revenues\r\nare to be expended locally, and if, at the same time, we give all\r\nreasonable encouragement to local self-government and shun any tendency\r\ntowards over-centralisation, we shall steer clear of one of the rocks on\r\nwhich the Roman ship of state was wrecked. Unskilful or unwise finance\r\nis our greatest danger, but here again the remedy lies ready to hand if\r\nwe are wise enough to avail ourselves of it. It consists in adapting our\r\nfiscal methods to the requirements of our subject races, and still more\r\nin the steadfast rejection of any proposals which, by rendering high\r\ntaxation inevitable, will infringe the cardinal principle on which a\r\nsound Imperial policy should be based. That principle is that, whilst\r\nthe sword should be always ready for use, it should be kept in reserve\r\nfor great emergencies, and that we should endeavour to find, in the\r\ncontentment of the subject race, a more worthy and, it may be hoped, a\r\nstronger bond of union between the rulers and the ruled.\r\n\r\nIf any more sweeping generalisation than this is required, it may be\r\nsaid that the whole, or nearly the whole, of the essential points of a\r\nsound Imperial policy admit of being embodied in this one statement,\r\nthat, whilst steadily avoiding any movement in the direction of official\r\nproselytism, our relations with the various races who are subjects of\r\nthe King of England should be founded on the granite rock of the\r\nChristian moral code.\r\n\r\n     Humanity, as it passes through phase after phase of the historical\r\n     movement, may advance indefinitely in excellence; but its advance\r\n     will be an indefinite approximation to the Christian type. A\r\n     divergence from that type, to whatever extent it may take place,\r\n     will not be progress, but debasement and corruption. In a moral\r\n     point of view, in short, the world may abandon Christianity, but\r\n     can never advance beyond it. This is not a matter of authority, or\r\n     even of revelation. If it is true, it is a matter of reason as much\r\n     as anything in the world.[23]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Italy and Her Invaders_. Thomas Hodgkin, D.C.L.

No one can doubt\r\nthat the office of a translator is to translate, but a wide difference\r\nof opinion may exist, and, in fact, has always existed, as to the\r\nlatitude which he may allow himself in translating. Is he to adhere\r\nrigidly to a literal rendering of the original text, or is paraphrase\r\npermissible, and, if permissible, within what limits may it be adopted?\r\nIn deciding which of these courses to pursue, the translator stands\r\nbetween Scylla and Charybdis. If he departs too widely from the precise\r\nwords of the text, he incurs the blame of the purist, who will accuse\r\nhim of foisting language on the original author which the latter never\r\nemployed, with the possible result that even the ideas or sentiments\r\nwhich it had been intended to convey have been disfigured. If, on the\r\nother hand, he renders word for word, he will often find, more\r\nespecially if his translation be in verse, that in a cacophonous attempt\r\nto force the genius of one language into an unnatural channel, the whole\r\nof the beauty and even, possibly, some of the real meaning of the\r\noriginal have been allowed to evaporate. Dr. Fitzmaurice-Kelly, in an\r\ninstructive article on Translation contributed to the _Encyclopaedia\r\nBritannica_ quotes the high authority of Dryden as to the course which\r\nshould be followed in the execution of an ideal translation.\r\n\r\n     A translator (Dryden writes) that would write with any force or\r\n     spirit of an original must never dwell on the words of his author.\r\n     He ought to possess himself entirely, and perfectly comprehend the\r\n     genius and sense of his author, the nature of the subject, and the\r\n     terms of the art or subject treated of; and then he will express\r\n     himself as justly, and with as much life, as if he wrote an\r\n     original; whereas he who copies word for word loses all the spirit\r\n     in the tedious transfusion.\r\n\r\nIn the application of Dryden's canon a distinction has to be made\r\nbetween prose and verse. The composition of good prose, which Coleridge\r\ndescribed as \"words in the right order,\" is, indeed, of the utmost\r\nimportance for all the purposes of the historian, the writer on\r\nphilosophy, or the orator. An example of the manner in which fine prose\r\ncan bring to the mind a vivid conception of a striking event is Jeremy\r\nCollier's description of Cranmer's death, which excited the enthusiastic\r\nadmiration of Mr. Gladstone.[24] He seemed [Collier wrote] \"to repel the\r\nforce of the fire and to overlook the torture, by strength of thought.\"\r\nNevertheless, the main object of the prose writer, and still more of the\r\norator, should be to state his facts or to prove his case. Cato laid\r\ndown the very sound principle \"rem tene, verba sequentur,\" and\r\nQuintilian held that \"no speaker, when important interests are involved,\r\nshould be very solicitous about his words.\" It is true that this\r\nprinciple is one that has been more often honoured in the breach than\r\nthe observance. Lucian, in his _Lexiphanes_,[25] directs the shafts of\r\nhis keen satire against the meticulous attention to phraseology\r\npractised by his contemporaries. Cardinal Bembo sacrificed substance to\r\nform to the extent of advising young men not to read St. Paul for fear\r\nthat their style should be injured, and Professor Saintsbury[26]\r\nmentions the case of a French author, Paul de Saint-Victor, who \"used,\r\nwhen sitting down to write, to put words that had struck his fancy at\r\nintervals over the sheet, and write his matter in and up to them.\" These\r\nare instances of that word-worship run mad which has not infrequently\r\nled to dire results, inasmuch as it has tended to engender the belief\r\nthat statesmanship is synonymous with fine writing or perfervid oratory.\r\nThe oratory in which Demosthenes excelled, Professor Bury says,[27] \"was\r\none of the curses of Greek politics.\"\r\n\r\nThe attention paid by the ancients to what may be termed tricks of style\r\nhas probably in some degree enhanced the difficulties of prose\r\ntranslation. It may not always be easy in a foreign language to\r\nreproduce the subtle linguistic shades of Demosthenic oratory--the\r\nAnaphora (repetition of the same word at the beginning of co-ordinate\r\nsentences following one another), the Anastrophe (the final word of a\r\nsentence repeated at the beginning of one immediately following), the\r\nPolysyndeton (the same conjunction repeated), or the Epidiorthosis (the\r\ncorrection of an expression). Nevertheless, in dealing with a prose\r\ncomposition, the weight of the arguments, the lucidity with which the\r\nfacts are set forth, and the force with which the conclusions are driven\r\nhome, rank, or should rank, in the mind of the reader higher than any\r\nfeelings which are derived from the music of the words or the skilful\r\norder in which they are arranged. Moreover, in prose more frequently\r\nthan in verse, it is the beauty of the idea expressed which attracts\r\nrather than the language in which it is clothed. Thus, for instance,\r\nthere can be no difficulty in translating the celebrated metaphor of\r\nPericles[28] that \"the loss of the youth of the city was as if the\r\nspring was taken out of the year,\" because the beauty of the idea can in\r\nno way suffer by presenting it in English, French, or German rather than\r\nin the original Greek. Again, to quote another instance from Latin, the\r\nfine epitaph to St. Ovinus in Ely Cathedral: \"Lucem tuam Ovino da, Deus,\r\net requiem,\" loses nothing of its terse pathos by being rendered into\r\nEnglish. Occasionally, indeed, the truth is forced upon us that even in\r\nprose \"a thing may be well said once but cannot be well said twice\" (τὸ\r\nκαλῶς εἰπεῖν ἅπαξ περιγίγνεται, δὶς δὲ οὐκ ἐνδέχεται), but this is\r\ngenerally because the genius of one language lends itself with special\r\nease to some singularly felicitous and often epigrammatic form of\r\nexpression which is almost or sometimes even quite untranslatable. Who,\r\nfor instance, would dare to translate into English the following\r\ndescription which the Duchesse de Dino[29] gave of a lady of her\r\nacquaintance: \"Elle n'a jamais été jolie, mais elle était blanche et\r\nfraîche, _avec quelques jolis détails\"_? On the whole, however, it may\r\nbe said that if the prose translator is thoroughly well acquainted with\r\nboth of the languages which he has to handle, he ought to be able to pay\r\nadequate homage to the genius of the one without offering undue violence\r\nto that of the other.\r\n\r\nThe case of the translator of poetry, which Coleridge defined as \"the\r\nbest words in the best order,\" is manifestly very different. A phrase\r\nwhich is harmonious or pregnant with fire in one language may become\r\ndiscordant, flat, and vapid when translated into another. Shelley spoke\r\nof \"the vanity of translation.\" \"It were as wise (he said) to cast a\r\nviolet into a crucible that you might discover the formal principle of\r\nits colour and odour, as seek to transfuse from one language into\r\nanother the creations of a poet.\"\r\n\r\nLonginus has told us[30] that \"beautiful words are the very light of\r\nthought\" (φῶς γὰρ τῷ ὄντι ἴδιον τοῦ νοῦ τὰ καλὰ ὀνόματα), but it will\r\noften happen, in reading a fine passage, that on analysing the\r\nsentiments evoked, it is difficult to decide whether they are due to\r\nthe thought or to the beauty of the words. A mere word, as in the case\r\nof Edgar Poe's \"Nevermore,\" has at times inspired a poet. When Keats,\r\nspeaking of Melancholy, says:\r\n\r\n    She lives with Beauty--Beauty that must die--\r\n    And Joy, whose hand is ever on his lips,\r\n    Bidding adieu,\r\n\r\nor when Mrs. Browning writes:\r\n\r\n                            ... Young\r\n    As Eve with Nature's daybreak on her face,\r\n\r\nthe pleasure, both of sense and sentiment, is in each case derived alike\r\nfrom the music of the language and the beauty of the ideas. But in such\r\nlines as\r\n\r\n    Arethusa arose from her couch of snows, etc.,\r\n\r\nor Coleridge's description of the river Alph running\r\n\r\n    Through caverns measureless to man\r\n          Down to a sunless sea,\r\n\r\nit is the language rather than the idea which fascinates. Professor\r\nWalker, speaking of the most exquisitely harmonious lyric ever written\r\nin English, or perhaps in any other language,[31] says with great truth:\r\n\"The reader of _Lycidas_ rises from it ready to grasp the 'two-handed\r\nengine' and smite; though he may be doubtful what the engine is, and\r\nwhat is to be smitten.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be observed, moreover, that one of the main difficulties to be\r\nencountered in translating some of the masterpieces of ancient\r\nliterature arises from their exquisite simplicity. Although the\r\nindulgence in glaring improprieties of language in the pursuit of\r\nnovelty of thought was not altogether unknown to the ancients, and was,\r\nindeed, stigmatised by Longinus with the epithet of \"corybantising,\"[32]\r\nthe full development of this pernicious practice has been reserved for\r\nthe modern world. Dryden made himself indirectly responsible for a good\r\ndeal of bad poetry when he said that great wits were allied to madness.\r\nThe late Professor Butcher,[33] as also Lamb in his essay on \"The Sanity\r\nof True Genius,\" have both pointed out that genius and high ability are\r\neminently sane.\r\n\r\nIn some respects it may be said that didactic poetry affords special\r\nfacilities to the translator, inasmuch as it bears a more close relation\r\nto prose than verse of other descriptions. Didactic poets, such as\r\nLucretius and Pope, are almost forced by the inexorable necessities of\r\ntheir subjects to think in prose. However much we may admire their\r\nverse, it is impossible not to perceive that, in dealing with subjects\r\nthat require great precision of thought, they have felt themselves\r\nhampered by the necessities of metre and rhythm. They may, indeed,\r\nresort to blank verse, which is a sort of half-way house between prose\r\nand rhyme, as was done by Mr. Leonard in his excellent translation of\r\nEmpedocles, of which the following specimen may be given:\r\n\r\n    οὐκ ἔστιν πελάσασθαι ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ἐφεκτὸν\r\n    ἡμετέροις ἢ χερσὶ λαβεῖν, ᾗπερ τε μεγίστη\r\n    πειθοῦς ἀνθρώποισιν ἁμαξιτὸς εἰς φρένα πίπτει.\r\n\r\n    We may not bring It near us with our eyes,\r\n    We may not grasp It with our human hands.\r\n    With neither hands nor eyes, those highways twain,\r\n    Whereby Belief drops into the minds of men.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Symmons, one of the numerous translators of Virgil, said, with\r\nsome truth, that the adoption of blank verse only involves \"a laborious\r\nand doubtful struggle to escape from the fangs of prose.\"[34]\r\n\r\nA good example of what can be done in this branch of literature is\r\nfurnished by Dryden. Lucretius[35] wrote:\r\n\r\n    Tu vero dubitabis et indignabere obire?\r\n    Mortua cui vita est prope iam vivo atque videnti,\r\n    Qui somno partem maiorem conteris aevi,\r\n    Et vigilans stertis nec somnia cernere cessas\r\n    Sollicitamque geris cassa formidine mentem\r\n    Nec reperire potes tibi quid sit saepe mali, cum\r\n    Ebrius urgeris multis miser undique curis,\r\n    Atque animi incerto fluitans errore vagaris.\r\n\r\nDryden's translation departs but slightly from the original text and at\r\nthe same time presents the ideas of Lucretius in rhythmical and\r\nmelodious English:\r\n\r\n    And thou, dost thou disdain to yield thy breath,\r\n    Whose very life is little more than death?\r\n    More than one-half by lazy sleep possest,\r\n    And when awake, thy soul but nods at best,\r\n    Day-dreams and sickly thoughts revolving in thy breast.\r\n    Eternal troubles haunt thy anxious mind,\r\n    Whose cause and case thou never hopest to find,\r\n    But still uncertain, with thyself at strife,\r\n    Thou wanderest in the labyrinth of life.\r\n\r\nDescriptive poetry also lends itself with comparative ease to\r\ntranslation. Nothing can be better than the translation made by Mr.\r\nGladstone[36] of _Iliad_ iv. 422-32. The original Greek runs thus:\r\n\r\n    ὡς δ' ὅτ' ἐν αἰγιαλῷ πολυηχέι· κῦμα θαλάσσης\r\n    ὄρνυτ' ἐπασσύτερον Ζεφύρου ὕπο κινήσαντος·\r\n    πόντῳ μέν τε πρῶτα κορύσσεται, αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα\r\n    χέρσῳ ῥηγνύμενον μεγάλα βρέμει, ἀμφὶ δέ τ' ἄκρας\r\n    κυρτὸν ἐὸν κορυφοῦται, ἀποπτύει δ' ἁλὸς ἄχνην·\r\n    ὧς τότ' ἐπασσύτεραι Δαναῶν κίνυντο φάλαγγες\r\n    νωλεμέως πόλεμόνδε. κέλευε δὲ οἷσιν ἕκαστος\r\n    ἡγεμόνων· οἱ δ' ἄλλοι ἀκὴν ἴσαν, οὐδέ κε φαίης\r\n    τόσσον λαὸν ἕπεσθαι ἔχοντ' ἐν στήθεσιν αὐδήν,\r\n    σιγῇ, δειδιότες σημάντορας· ἀμφὶ δὲ πᾶσι\r\n    τεύχεα ποικίλ' ἔλαμπε, τὰ εἱμένοι ἐστιχόωντο.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, who evidently drew his inspiration from the author of\r\n\"Marmion\" and \"The Lady of the Lake,\" translated as follows:\r\n\r\n    As when the billow gathers fast\r\n      With slow and sullen roar,\r\n    Beneath the keen north-western blast,\r\n      Against the sounding shore.\r\n    First far at sea it rears its crest,\r\n      Then bursts upon the beach;\r\n    Or with proud arch and swelling breast,\r\n      Where headlands outward reach,\r\n    It smites their strength, and bellowing flings\r\n      Its silver foam afar--\r\n    So stern and thick the Danaan kings\r\n      And soldiers marched to war.\r\n    Each leader gave his men the word,\r\n    Each warrior deep in silence heard,\r\n    So mute they marched, them couldst not ken\r\n    They were a mass of speaking men;\r\n    And as they strode in martial might\r\n    Their flickering arms shot back the light.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, in dealing with poetry which is neither didactic nor\r\ndescriptive that the difficulty--indeed often the impossibility--of\r\nreconciling the genius of the two languages becomes most apparent. It\r\nmay be said with truth that the best way of ascertaining how a fine or\r\nluminous idea can be presented in any particular language is to set\r\naside altogether the idea of translation, and to inquire how some master\r\nin the particular language has presented the case without reference to\r\nthe utterances of his predecessors in other languages. A good example of\r\nthis process may be found in comparing the language in which others have\r\ntreated Vauvenargues' well-known saying: \"Pour exécuter de grandes\r\nchoses, il faut vivre comme si on ne devait jamais mourir.\"\r\nBacchylides[37] put the same idea in the following words:\r\n\r\n    θνατὸν εὖντα χρὴ διδύμους ἀέξειν\r\n    γνώμας, ὅτι τ' αὔριον ὄψεαι\r\n    μοῦνον ἁλίου φάος,\r\n    χὥτι πεντήκοντ' ἔτεα\r\n    ζωὰν βαθύπλουτον τελεῖς.[38]\r\n\r\nAnd the great Arab poet Abu'l'Ala, whose verse has been admirably\r\ntranslated by Mr. Baerlein, wrote:\r\n\r\n    If you will do some deed before you die,\r\n      Remember not this caravan of death,\r\n      But have belief that every little breath\r\n    Will stay with you for an eternity.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of the same kind, which may be cited without in any way\r\nwishing to advance what Professor Courthope[39] very justly calls \"the\r\nmean charge of plagiarism,\" is Tennyson's line, \"His honour rooted in\r\ndishonour stood.\" Euripides[40] expressed the same idea in the following\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n    ἐκ τῶν γὰρ αἰσχρῶν ἐσθλὰ μηχανώμεθα.\r\n\r\nTo cite another case, the following lines of _Paradise Lost_ may be\r\ncompared with the treatment accorded by Euripides to the same subject:\r\n\r\n                    Oh, why did God,\r\n    Creator wise, that peopled highest Heaven\r\n    With spirits masculine, create at last\r\n    This novelty on Earth, this fair defect\r\n    Of Nature, and not fill the World at once\r\n    With men as Angels, without feminine;\r\n    Or find some other way to generate\r\n    Mankind?\r\n\r\nEuripides wrote:\r\n\r\n    ὦ Ζεῦ, τί δὴ κίβδηλον ἀνθρώποις κακόν,\r\n    γυναῖκας ἐς φῶς ἡλίου κατῴκισας;\r\n    εἰ γὰρ βρότειον ἤθελες σπεῖραι γένος,\r\n    οὐκ ἐκ γυναικῶν χρῆν παρασχέσθαι τόδε.[41]\r\n\r\nApart, however, from the process to which allusion is made above, very\r\nmany instances may, of course, be cited, of translations properly so\r\ncalled which have reproduced not merely the exact sense but the vigour\r\nof the original idea in a foreign language with little or no resort to\r\nparaphrase. What can be better than Cowley's translation of Claudian's\r\nlines?--\r\n\r\n    Ingentem meminit parvo qui germine quercum\r\n      Aequaevumque videt consenuisse nemus.\r\n\r\n    A neighbouring wood born with himself he sees,\r\n    And loves his old contemporary trees,\r\n\r\nthus, as Gibbon says,[42] improving on the original, inasmuch as, being\r\na good botanist, Cowley \"concealed the oaks under a more general\r\nexpression.\"\r\n\r\nTake also the case of the well-known Latin epigram:\r\n\r\n    Omne epigramma sit instar apis: sit aculeus illi;\r\n      Sint sua mella; sit et corporis exigui.\r\n\r\nIt has frequently been translated, but never more felicitously or\r\naccurately than by the late Lord Wensleydale:\r\n\r\n    Be epigrams like bees; let them have stings;\r\n    And Honey too, and let them be small things.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the attempt to adhere too closely to the text of the\r\noriginal and to reject paraphrase sometimes leads to results which can\r\nscarcely be described as other than the reverse of felicitous. An\r\ninstance in point is Sappho's lines:\r\n\r\n    καὶ γὰρ αἰ φεύγει, ταχέως διώξει,\r\n    αἰ δὲ δῶρα μὴ δέκετ', ἄλλα δώσει,\r\n    αἰ δὲ μὴ φίλει, ταχέως φιλήσει\r\n                        κωὐκ ἐθέλοισα.\r\n\r\nSo great a master of verse as Mr. Headlam translated thus:\r\n\r\n    The pursued shall soon be the pursuer!\r\n      Gifts, though now refusing, yet shall bring\r\n    Love the lover yet, and woo the wooer,\r\n      Though heart it wring!\r\n\r\nMany of Mr. Headlam's translations are, however, excellent, more\r\nespecially those from English into Greek. He says in his preface:\r\n\"Greek, in my experience, is easier to write than English.\" He has\r\nadmirably reproduced the pathetic simplicity of Herrick's lines:\r\n\r\n    Here a pretty baby lies,\r\n    Sung to sleep with Lullabies;\r\n    Pray be silent and not stir\r\n    The easy earth that covers her.\r\n\r\n    μήτηρ βαυκαλόωσά μ' ἐκοίμισεν· ἀτρέμα βαῖνε\r\n        μὴ 'γείρῃς κούφην γῆν μ' ἐπιεσσόμενον.\r\n\r\nMany singularly happy attempts to render English into Latin or Greek\r\nverse are given in Mr. Kennedy's fascinating little volume _Between\r\nWhiles_, of which the following example may be quoted:\r\n\r\n    Few the words that I have spoken;\r\n      True love's words are ever few;\r\n    Yet by many a speechless token\r\n      Hath my heart discoursed to you.\r\n\r\n    οἶδα παῦρ' ἔπη λαλήσας· παῦρ' ἔρως λαλεῖν φιλεῖ·\r\n    ξυμβόλοις δ' ὅμως ἀναύδοις σοὶ τὸ πᾶν ᾐνιξάμην.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which it is necessary to resort to paraphrase will, of\r\ncourse, vary greatly, and will largely depend upon whether the language\r\ninto which the translation is made happens to furnish epithets and\r\nexpressions which are rhythmical and at the same time correspond\r\naccurately to those of the original. Take, for instance, a case such as\r\nthe following fragment of Euripides:\r\n\r\n    τὰ μὲν διδακτὰ μανθάνω, τὰ δ' εὑρετὰ\r\n    ζητῶ, τὰ δ' εὐκτὰ παρὰ θεῶν ᾐτησάμην.\r\n\r\nThere is but little difficulty in turning this into English verse with\r\nbut slight resort to paraphrase:\r\n\r\n    I learn what may be taught;\r\n    I seek what may be sought;\r\n    My other wants I dare\r\n    To ask from Heaven in prayer,\r\n\r\nBut in a large majority of cases paraphrase is almost imposed on the\r\ntranslator by the necessities of the case. Mr. William Cory's rendering\r\nof the famous verses of Callimachus on his friend Heraclitus, which is\r\ntoo well known to need quotation, has been justly admired as one of the\r\nbest and most poetic translations ever made from Greek, but it can\r\nscarcely be called a translation in the sense in which that term is\r\nemployed by purists. It is a paraphrase.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to dwell on the difficulty of finding any suitable words\r\ncapable of being adapted to the necessities of English metre and rhythm\r\nfor the numerous and highly poetic adjectives in which the Greek\r\nlanguage abounds. It would tax the ingenuity of any translator to weave\r\ninto his verse expressions corresponding to the ἁλιερκέες ὄχθαι\r\n(sea-constraining cliffs) or the Μναμοσύνας λιπαράμπυκος (Mnemosyne of\r\nthe shining fillet) of Pindar. Neither is the difficulty wholly confined\r\nto poetry. A good many epithets have from time to time been applied to\r\nthe Nile, but none so graphic or so perfectly accurate as that employed\r\nby Herodotus,[43] who uses the phrase ὑπὸ τοσούτου τε ποταμοῦ καὶ οὕτω\r\nἐργατικοῦ. The English translation \"that vast river, so constantly at\r\nwork\" is a poor equivalent for the original Greek. German possesses to a\r\ngreater degree than any other modern language the word-coining power\r\nwhich was such a marked characteristic of Greek, with the result that it\r\noffers special difficulties to the translator of verse. Mr. Brandes[44]\r\nquotes the following lines of the German poet Bücher:\r\n\r\n    Welche Heldenfreudigkeit der Liebe,\r\n    Welche Stärke muthigen Entsagens,\r\n    Welche himmlisch erdentschwungene Triebe,\r\n    Welche Gottbegeistrung des Ertragens!\r\n    Welche Sich-Erhebung, Sich-Erwiedrung,\r\n    Sich-Entäussrung, völl'ge Hin-sich-gebung,\r\n    Seelenaustausch, Ineinanderlebung!\r\n\r\nIt is probable that these lines have never been translated into English\r\nverse, and it is obvious that no translation, which did not largely\r\nconsist of paraphrase, would be possible.\r\n\r\nAlliteration, which is a powerful literary instrument in the hands of a\r\nskilful writer, but which may easily be allowed to degenerate into a\r\nmere jingle, is of less common occurrence in Greek than in English,\r\nnotably early English, literature. It was, however, occasionally\r\nemployed by both poets and dramatists. Euripides, for instance, in the\r\n_Cyclops_ (l. 120) makes use of the following expression, which would\r\nserve as a good motto for an Anarchist club, ἀκούει δ' οὐδὲν οὐδεὶς\r\nοὐδενός. Clytemnestra, also, in speaking of the murder of her husband\r\n(_Ag._ 1551-52) says:\r\n\r\n                            πρὸς ἡμῶν\r\n    κάππεσε, κάτθανε, καὶ καταθάψομεν.[45]\r\n\r\nThat Greek alliteration is capable of imitation is shown by Pope's\r\ntranslation of the well-known line[46]:\r\n\r\n    πολλὰ δ' ἄναντα κάταντα πάραντά τε δόχμιὰ τ' ἦλθον·\r\n\r\n    O'er hills, o'er dales, o'er crags, o'er rocks, they go.\r\n\r\nPope at times brought alliteration to his aid in cases where no such\r\ndevice had been adopted by Homer, as when, in describing the labours of\r\nSisyphus,[47] he wrote:\r\n\r\n    With many a weary step, and many a groan,\r\n    Up the high hill he heaves a huge round stone.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, although a good deal more than is contained in this\r\narticle may be said on either side, it would appear that, broadly\r\nspeaking, Dryden's principle holds good for prose translations, and that\r\nexperience has shown, in respect to translations in verse, that, save in\r\nrare instances, a resort to paraphrase is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe writer ventures, in conclusion, to give two instances, in one of\r\nwhich there has been comparatively but slight departure from the text of\r\nthe original Greek, whilst in the other there has been greater\r\nindulgence in paraphrase. Both are taken from the Anthology. The first\r\nis an epitaph on a shipwrecked sailor by an unknown author:\r\n\r\n    Ναυτίλε, μὴ πεύθου τίνος ἐνθάδε τύμβος ὅδ' εἰμί,\r\n        ἀλλ' αὐτὸς πόντου τύγχανε χρηστοτέρου.\r\n\r\n    No matter who I was; but may the sea\r\n    To you prove kindlier than it was to me.\r\n\r\nThe other is by Macedonius:\r\n\r\n    Αὔριον ἀθρήσω σε· τὸ δ' οὔ ποτε γίνεται ἡμῖν\r\n      ἠθάδος ἀμβολίης αἰὲν ἀεξομένης·\r\n    ταῦτά μοι ἱμείροντι χαρίζεαι, ἄλλα δ' ἐς ἄλλους\r\n      δῶρα φέρεις, ἐμεθέν πίστιν ἀπειπαμένη.\r\n    ὄψομαι ἑσπερίη σε. τί δ' ἕσπερός έστι γυναικῶν;\r\n      γῆρας ἀμετρήτῳ πληθόμενον ῥυτίδι.\r\n\r\n    Ever \"To-morrow\" thou dost say;\r\n      When will to-morrow's sun arise?\r\n    Thus custom ratifies delay;\r\n      My faithfulness thou dost despise.\r\n    Others are welcomed, whilst to me\r\n      \"At even come,\" thou say'st, \"not now.\"\r\n    What will life's evening bring to thee?\r\n      Old age--a many-wrinkled brow.\r\n\r\nDryden's well-known lines in _Aurengzebe_ embody the idea of Macedonius\r\nin epigrammatic and felicitous verse:\r\n\r\n    Trust on, and think to-morrow will repay,\r\n    To-morrow's falser than the former day.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Morley's _Life of Gladstone_, vol. iii. p. 467.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Weise, 1841, vol. ii. p. 303.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: _Loci Critici_, p. 40.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: _History of Greece_, vol. ii. p. 326.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: The use by Pericles of this metaphor rests on the\r\nauthority of Aristotle (_Rhet._ i. 7. 34).

More than this, although\r\nour characters differed widely, and although I should never for a moment\r\nthink of rating my intellectual attainments on a par with his, at the\r\nsame time I may say that in the course of a long life I do not think\r\nthat I have ever been brought in contact with any one with whom I found\r\nmyself in more thorough community of opinion and sentiment upon the\r\nsundry and manifold questions which excited our common interest. He was\r\na strong Unionist, a strong Free Trader, and a strong anti-suffragist.\r\nI am, for good or evil, all these things. He was a sincere Liberal in\r\nthe non-party sense of that very elastic word. So was I. That is to say,\r\nthere was a time when we both thought ourselves good mid-Victorian\r\nLiberals--a school of politicians whose ideas have now been swept into\r\nthe limbo of forgotten things, the only surviving principles of that age\r\nbeing apparently those associated with a faint and somewhat fantastic\r\ncult of the primrose. In 1866 he wrote to his sister--and I cannot but\r\nsmile on reading the letter--\"I am more and more Radical every year\";\r\nand he expressed regret that circumstances did not permit of his setting\r\nup as \"a fierce demagogue\" in England. I could have conscientiously\r\nwritten in much the same spirit at the same period, but it has not taken\r\nme nearly half a century to discover that two persons more unfitted by\r\nnature and temperament to be \"fierce demagogues\" than Alfred Lyall and\r\nmyself were probably never born. In respect to the Indian political\r\nquestions which were current during his day--such as the controversy\r\nbetween the Lawrentian and \"Forward\" schools of frontier policy, the\r\nCurzon-Kitchener episode, and the adaptation of Western reforms to meet\r\nthe growing requirements to which education has given birth--his views,\r\nalthough perhaps rather in my opinion unduly pessimistic and\r\ndesponding, were generally identical with my own.\r\n\r\nAlbeit he was an earnest reformer, he was a warm advocate of strong and\r\ncapable government, and, in writing to our common friend, Lord Morley,\r\nin 1882, he anathematised what he considered the weakness shown by the\r\nGladstone Government in dealing with disorder in Ireland. Himself not\r\nonly the kindest, but also the most just and judicially-minded of men,\r\nhe feared that a maudlin and misplaced sentimentalism would destroy the\r\nmore virile elements in the national character. \"I should like,\" he\r\nsaid, in words which must not, of course, be taken too literally, \"a\r\nlittle more fierceness and honest brutality in the national\r\ntemperament.\" His heart went out, in a manner which is only possible to\r\nthose who have watched them closely at work, to those Englishmen,\r\nwhether soldiers or civilians, who, but little known and even at times\r\ndepreciated by their own countrymen, are carrying the fame, the glory,\r\nthe justice and humanity of England to the four quarters of the globe.\r\n\r\n     The roving Englishman (he said) is the salt of English land....\r\n     Only those who go out of this civilised country, to see the rough\r\n     work on the frontiers and in the far lands, properly understand\r\n     what our men are like and can do.... They cannot manage a\r\n     steam-engine, but they can drive restive and ill-trained horses\r\n     over rough roads.\r\n\r\nHe felt--and as one who has humbly dabbled in literature at the close of\r\nan active political life, I can fully sympathise with him--that \"when\r\none has once taken a hand in the world's affairs, literature is like\r\nrowing in a picturesque reach of the Thames after a bout in the open\r\nsea.\" Yet, in the case of Lyall, literature was not a matter of mere\r\nacademic interest. \"His incessant study was history.\" He thought, with\r\nLord Acton, that an historical student should be \"a politician with his\r\nface turned backwards.\" His mind was eminently objective. He was for\r\never seeking to know the causes of things; and though far too observant\r\nto push to extreme lengths analogies between the past and the present,\r\nhe nevertheless sought, notably in the history of Imperial Rome, for any\r\nfacts or commentaries gleaned from ancient times which might be of\r\nservice to the modern empire of which he was so justly proud, and in the\r\nfoundation of which the splendid service of which he was an illustrious\r\nmember had played so conspicuous a part. \"I wonder,\" he wrote in 1901,\r\n\"how far the Roman Empire profited by high education.\"\r\n\r\nLyall was by nature a poet. Sir Mortimer Durand says, truly enough, that\r\nhis volume of verses, \"if not great poetry, as some hold, was yet true\r\npoetry.\" Poetic expressions, in fact, bubbled up in his mind almost\r\nunconsciously in dealing with every incident of his life. Lord Tennyson\r\ntells us in his _Memoir_ that one evening, when his father and mother\r\nwere rowing across the Solent, they saw a heron. His father described\r\nthis incident in the following language: \"One dark heron flew over the\r\nsea, backed by a daffodil sky.\" Similarly, Lyall, writing with the\r\nenthusiasm of a young father for his firstborn, said: \"The child has\r\neyes like the fish-pools of Heshbon, with wondrous depth of intelligent\r\ngaze.\" But, though a poet, it would be a great error to suppose that\r\nLyall was an idealist, if by that term is meant one who, after a\r\nplatonic fashion, indulges in ideas which are wholly visionary and\r\nunpractical. He had, indeed, ideals. No man of his imagination and\r\nmental calibre could be without them. But they were ideals based on a\r\nsolid foundation of facts. It was here that, in spite of some sympathy\r\nbased on common literary tastes, he altogether parted company from a\r\nbrother poet, Mr. Wilfrid Blunt, who has invariably left his facts to\r\ntake care of themselves. Though eminently meditative and reflective,\r\nLyall's mind, his biographer says, \"seemed always hungry for facts.\"\r\n\"Though he had an unusual degree of imagination, he never allowed\r\nhimself to be tempted too far from the region of the known or the\r\nknowable.\" The reason why he at times appeared to vacillate was that he\r\ndid not consider he sufficiently understood all the facts to justify his\r\nforming an opinion capable of satisfying his somewhat hypercritical\r\njudgment. He was, in fact, very difficult to convince of the truth of an\r\nopinion, not because of his prejudices, for he had none, but by reason\r\nof his constitutional scepticism. He acted throughout life on the\r\nprinciple laid down by the Greek philosopher Epicharmus: \"Be sober, and\r\nremember to disbelieve. These are the sinews of the mind.\" I have been\r\ninformed on unimpeachable authority that when he was a member of the\r\nTreasury Committee which sat on the question of providing facilities for\r\nthe study of Oriental languages in this country, he constantly asked the\r\nwitnesses whom he examined leading questions from which it might rather\r\nbe inferred that he held opinions diametrically opposed to those which\r\nin reality he entertained. His sole object was to arrive at a sound\r\nconclusion. He wished to elicit all possible objections to any views to\r\nwhich he was personally inclined. It is very probable that his Oriental\r\nexperience led him to adopt this procedure; for, as any one who has\r\nlived much in the East will recognise, it is the only possible safeguard\r\nagainst the illusions which may arise from the common Oriental habit of\r\nendeavouring to say what is pleasant to the interrogator, especially if\r\nhe occupies some position of authority.\r\n\r\nOnly half-reconciled, in the first instance, to Indian exile, and, when\r\nonce he had taken the final step of departure, constantly brooding over\r\nthe intellectual attractions rather than the material comforts of\r\nEuropean life, Lyall speedily came to the conclusion that, if he was to\r\nbear a hand in governing India, the first thing he had to do was to\r\nunderstand Indians. He therefore brought his acutely analytical\r\nintellect to the task of comprehending the Indian habit of thought. In\r\nthe course of his researches he displayed that thoroughness and\r\npassionate love of truth which was the distinguishing feature of his\r\ncharacter throughout life. That he succeeded in a manner which has been\r\nsurpassed by none, and only faintly rivalled by a very few, is now\r\ngenerally recognised both by his own countrymen and also--which is far\r\nmore remarkable--by the inhabitants of the country which formed the\r\nsubject of his study. So far as it is possible for any Western to\r\nachieve that very difficult task, he may be said to have got to the back\r\nof the Oriental mind. He embodied the results of his long experience at\r\ntimes in sweeping and profound generalisations, which covered the whole\r\nfield of Oriental thought and action, and at others in pithy\r\nepigrammatic sayings in which the racy humour, sometimes tinged with a\r\nshade of cynical irony, never obscured the deep feeling of sympathy he\r\nentertained for everything that was worthy of respect and admiration.\r\n\r\nLyall had read history to some purpose. He knew, in the words which\r\nGregorovius applied to the rule of Theodosius in Italy, that \"not even\r\nthe wisest and most humane of princes, if he be an alien in race, in\r\ncustoms and religion, can ever win the hearts of the people.\" He had\r\nread De Tocqueville, and from the pages of an author whose habit of\r\nthought must have been most congenial to him, he drew the conclusion\r\nthat \"it was the increased prosperity and enlightenment of the French\r\npeople which produced the grand crash.\" He therefore thought that \"the\r\nwildest, as well as the shallowest notion of all is that universally\r\nprevalent belief that education, civilisation and increased material\r\nprosperity will reconcile the people of India eventually to our rule.\"\r\nHence he was prepared to accept--perhaps rather more entirely than it\r\ndeserved to be accepted--the statement of that very astute Brahmin, Sir\r\nDinkur Rao, himself the minister of an important native State, that \"the\r\nnatives prefer a bad native Government to our best patent institutions.\"\r\nThese, and similar oracular statements, have now become the commonplaces\r\nof all who deal with questions affecting India. That there is much\r\ntruth in them cannot be gainsaid, but they are still often too much\r\nignored by one section of the British public, who, carried away by\r\nhome-made sentiment, forget that of all national virtues gratitude for\r\nfavours received is the most rare, while by another section they are\r\napplied to the advocacy of a degree of autonomous rule which would be\r\ndisastrous to the interests, not only of India itself, but also to the\r\ncause of all real civilised progress.\r\n\r\nThe point, however, on which in conversation Lyall was wont to insist\r\nmost strongly was that the West was almost incomprehensible to the East,\r\nand, _vice versa_, that the Western could never thoroughly understand\r\nthe Oriental. In point of fact, when we talk of progress, it is\r\nnecessary to fix some standard by which progress may be measured. We\r\nknow our Western standard; we endeavour to enforce it; and we are so\r\nconvinced that it gives an accurate measure of human moral and material\r\nadvancement that we experience a shock on hearing that there are large\r\nnumbers of even highly educated human beings who hold that the standard\r\nis altogether false. Yet that, Lyall would argue, is generally the\r\nOriental frame of mind. Fatalism, natural conservatism and ignorance\r\nlead the uneducated to reject our ideas, while the highly educated often\r\nhold that our standard of progress is too material to be a true\r\nmeasure, and that consequently, far from advancing, we are standing\r\nstill or even retrograding. Lyall, personifying a Brahmin, said,\r\n\"Politics I cannot help regarding as the superficial aspect of deeper\r\nproblems; and for progress, the latest incarnation of European\r\nmaterialism, I have an incurable distrust.\" These subtle intellectuals,\r\nin fact, as Surendranath Banerjee, one of the leaders of the Swadeshi\r\nmovement, told Dr. Wegener,[48] hold that the English are \"stupid and\r\nignorant,\" and, therefore, wholly unfit to govern India.\r\n\r\nI remember Lyall, who, as Sir Mortimer Durand says, had a very keen\r\nsense of humour, telling me an anecdote which is what Bacon would have\r\ncalled \"luciferous,\" as an illustration of the views held by the\r\nuneducated classes in India on the subject of Western reforms. The\r\nofficer in charge of a district either in Bengal or the North-West\r\nProvinces got up a cattle-show, with a view to improving the breed of\r\ncattle. Shortly afterwards, an Englishman, whilst out shooting, entered\r\ninto conversation with a peasant who happened to be passing by. He asked\r\nthe man what he thought of the cattle-show, and added that he supposed\r\nit had done a great deal of good. \"Yes,\" the native, who was probably a\r\nMoslem, replied after some reflection, \"last year there was cholera.\r\nThis year there was Cattle Show. We have to bear these afflictions with\r\nwhat patience we may. Are they not all sent by God?\"\r\n\r\nBut it was naturally the opinions entertained by the intellectual\r\nclasses which most interested Lyall, and which he endeavoured to\r\ninterpret to his countrymen. The East is asymmetrical in all things. I\r\nremember Lyall saying to me, \"Accuracy is abhorrent to the Oriental\r\nmind.\" The West, on the other hand, delights beyond all things in\r\nsymmetry and accuracy. Moreover, it would almost seem as if in the most\r\ntrivial incidents in life some unseen influence generally impels the\r\nEastern to do the exact opposite to the Western--a point, I may observe,\r\nwhich Lyall was never tired of illustrating by all kinds of quaint\r\nexamples. A shepherd in Perthshire will walk behind his sheep and drive\r\nthem. In the Deccan he will walk in front of his flock. A European will\r\ngenerally place his umbrella point downwards against the wall. An\r\nOriental will, with far greater reason, do exactly the reverse.\r\n\r\nBut, in respect to the main question of mutual comprehension, there are,\r\nat all events in so far as the European is concerned, degrees of\r\ndifficulty--degrees which depend very largely on religious differences,\r\nfor in the theocratic East religion covers the whole social and\r\npolitical field to a far greater extent than in the West. Now, the\r\nreligion of the Moslem is, comparatively speaking, very easy to\r\nunderstand. There are, indeed, a few ritualistic and other minor points\r\nas to which a Western may at times have some difficulty in grasping the\r\nOriental point of view. But the foundations of monotheistic Islam are\r\nsimplicity itself; indeed, it may be said that they are far more simple\r\nthan those of Christianity. The case of the Hindu religion is very\r\ndifferent. Dr. Barth in his _Religions of India_ says:\r\n\r\n     Already in the Veda, Hindu thought is profoundly tainted with the\r\n     malady, of which it will never be able to get rid, of affecting a\r\n     greater air of mystery the less there is to conceal, of making a\r\n     parade of symbols which at bottom signify nothing, and of playing\r\n     with enigmas which are not worth the trouble of trying to\r\n     unriddle.... At the present time it is next to impossible to say\r\n     exactly what Hinduism is, where it begins, and where it ends.\r\n\r\nI cannot profess to express any valuable opinion on a subject on which I\r\nam very imperfectly informed, and which, save as a matter of political\r\nnecessity, fails to interest me--for, personally, I think that a book of\r\nthe _Iliad_ or a play of Aristophanes is far more valuable than all the\r\nlucubrations that have ever been spun by the subtle minds of learned\r\nHindu Pundits--but, so far as I am able to judge, Dr. Barth's\r\ndescription is quite accurate. None the less, the importance to the\r\nIndian politician of gaining some insight into the inner recesses of the\r\nHindu mind cannot for a moment be doubted. Lyall said, \"I fancy that the\r\nHindu philosophy, which teaches that everything we see or feel is a vast\r\ncosmic illusion, projected into space by that which is the manifestation\r\nof the infinite and unconscious spirit, has an unsettling effect on\r\ntheir political beliefs.\" Lyall, therefore, rendered a very great\r\npolitical service to his countrymen when he took in hand the duty of\r\nexpounding to them the true nature of Hindu religious belief. He did the\r\nwork very thoroughly. Passing lightly by the \"windy moralities\" of\r\nBrahmo Somaj teachers of the type of Keshub Chunder Sen, whom he left to\r\n\"drifting Deans such as Stanley and Alford,\" he grasped the full\r\nsignificance of true orthodox Brahmanism, and under the pseudonym of\r\nVamadeo Shastri wrote an essay which has \"become a classic for the\r\nstudent of comparative religion, and for all who desire to know, in\r\nparticular, the religious mind of the Hindu.\" In the course of his\r\nenquiries Lyall incidentally performed the useful historical service of\r\nshowing that Euhemerism is, or very recently was, a living force in\r\nIndia,[49] and that the solar myth theory supported by Max Müller and\r\nothers had, to say the least, been pushed much too far.\r\n\r\nI turn to another point. All who were brought in contact with Lyall\r\nspeedily recognised his social charm and high intellectual gifts, but\r\nwas he a man of action? Did he possess the qualifications necessary to\r\nthose who take part in the government of the outlying dominions of the\r\nEmpire? I have often been asked that question. It is one to which Sir\r\nMortimer Durand frequently reverts, his general conclusion being that\r\nLyall was \"a man of action with literary tastes.\" I will endeavour\r\nbriefly to express my own opinion on this subject.\r\n\r\nThere have been many cases of notable men of action who were also\r\nstudents. Napier said that no example can be shown in history of a great\r\ngeneral who was not also a well-read man. But Lyall was more than a mere\r\nstudent. He was a thinker, and a very deep thinker, not merely on\r\npolitical but also on social and religious subjects. There may be some\r\nparallel in the history of our own or of other countries to the peculiar\r\ncombination of thought and action which characterised Lyall's career,\r\nbut for the moment none which meets all the necessary requirements\r\noccurs to me. The case is, I think, almost if not quite unique. That\r\nLyall had a warm admiration for men of action is abundantly clear. His\r\nenthusiasm on their behalf comes out in every stanza of his poetry, and,\r\nwhen any suitable occasion offered, in every line of his prose. He\r\neulogised the strong man who ruled and acted, and he reserved a very\r\nspecial note of sympathy for those who sacrificed their lives for their\r\ncountry. Shortly before his own death he spoke in terms of warm\r\nadmiration of Mr. Newbolt's fine lines:\r\n\r\n    Qui procul hinc--the legend's writ,\r\n      The frontier grave is far away--\r\n    Qui ante diem periit\r\n      Sed miles, sed pro patriâ.\r\n\r\nBut he shared these views with many thinkers who, like Carlyle, have\r\nformed their opinions in their studies. The fact that he entertained\r\nthem does not help us to answer the question whether he can or cannot be\r\nhimself classed in the category of men of action.\r\n\r\nAs a young man he took a distinguished part in the suppression of the\r\nMutiny, and showed courage and decision of character in all his acts. He\r\nwas a good, though not perhaps an exceptionally good administrator. His\r\nhorror of disorder in any form led him to approve without hesitation the\r\nadoption of strong measures for its suppression. On the occasion of the\r\npunishment administered to those guilty of the Manipur massacres in\r\n1891, he wrote to Sir Mortimer Durand, \"I do most heartily admire the\r\njustice and firmness of purpose displayed in executing the Senapati. I\r\nhope there will be no interference, in my absence, from the India\r\nOffice.\" On the whole, the verdict passed by Lord George Hamilton is, I\r\nbelieve, eminently correct, and is entirely in accordance with my own\r\nexperience. Lord George, who had excellent opportunities for forming a\r\nsound opinion on the subject, wrote:\r\n\r\n     Great as were Lyall's literary attributes and powers of initiation\r\n     and construction, his critical faculties were even more fully\r\n     developed. This made him at times somewhat difficult to deal with,\r\n     for he was very critical and cautious in the tendering of advice as\r\n     regards any new policy or any suggested change. When once he could\r\n     see his way through difficulties, or came to the conclusion that\r\n     those difficulties must be faced, then his caution and critical\r\n     instincts disappeared, and he was prepared to be as bold in the\r\n     prosecution of what he advocated as he had previously been\r\n     reluctant to start.\r\n\r\nThe mental attitude which Lord George Hamilton thus describes is by no\r\nmeans uncommon in the case of very conscientious and brilliantly\r\nintellectual men, such, for instance, as the late Lord Goschen, who\r\npossessed many characteristics in common with Lyall. They can cite, in\r\njustification of their procedure, the authority of one who was probably\r\nthe greatest man of action that the world has ever produced. Roederer\r\nrelates in his journal that on one occasion Napoleon said to him:\r\n\r\n     Il n'y a pas un homme plus pusillanime que moi quand je fais un\r\n     plan militaire; je me grossis tous les dangers et tous les maux\r\n     possibles dans les circonstances; je suis dans une agitation tout à\r\n     fait pénible; je suis comme une fille qui accouche. Et quand ma\r\n     résolution est prise, tout est oublié, hors ce qui peut la faire\r\n     réussir.\r\n\r\nWithin reasonable limits, caution is, indeed, altogether commendable. On\r\nthe other hand, it cannot be doubted that, carried to excess, it is at\r\ntimes apt to paralyse all effective and timely action, to disqualify\r\nthose who exercise it from being pilots possessed of sufficient daring\r\nto steer the ship of state in troublous times, and to exclude them from\r\nthe category of men of action in the sense in which that term is\r\ngenerally used. In spite of my great affection for Alfred Lyall, I am\r\nforced to admit that, in his case, caution was, I think, at times\r\ncarried to excess. He never appeared to me to realise sufficiently that\r\nthe conduct of public affairs, notably in this democratic age, is at\r\nbest a very rough unscientific process; that it is occasionally\r\nnecessary to make a choice of evils or to act on imperfect evidence; and\r\nthat at times, to quote the words which I remember Lord Northbrook once\r\nused to me, it is even better to have a wrong opinion than to have no\r\ndefinite opinion at all. So early as 1868, he wrote to his mother,\r\n\"There are many topics on which I have not definitely discovered what I\r\ndo think\"; and to the day of his death he very generally maintained in\r\nrespect to current politics the frame of mind set forth in this very\r\ncharacteristic utterance. Every general has to risk the loss of a\r\nbattle, and every active politician has at times to run the risk of\r\nmaking a wrong forecast. Before running that risk, Lyall was generally\r\ninclined to exhaust the chances of error to an extent which was often\r\nimpossible, or at all events hurtful.\r\n\r\nSir Mortimer Durand refers to the history of the Ilbert Bill, a measure\r\nunder which Lord Ripon's Government proposed to give native magistrates\r\njurisdiction over Europeans in certain circumstances. I was at the time\r\n(1882-83) Financial Member of the Viceroy's Council. After a lapse of\r\nthirty years, there can, I think, be no objection to my stating my\r\nrecollections of what occurred in connexion with this subject. I should,\r\nin the first instance, mention that the association of Mr. (now Sir\r\nCourtenay) Ilbert's name with this measure was purely accidental. He had\r\nnothing to do with its initiation. The proposals, which were eventually\r\nembodied in the Bill, originated with Sir Ashley Eden, who was\r\nLieutenant-Governor of Bengal, and who certainly could not be accused of\r\nany wish to neglect European opinion, or of any desire to push forward\r\nextreme liberal measures conceived in native interests. The measure had\r\nbeen under the consideration of the Legislative Department in the time\r\nof Mr. Ilbert's predecessor in the office of Legal Member of Council,\r\nand it was only the accident that he vacated his office before it was\r\nintroduced into the Legislative Council that associated Mr. Ilbert's\r\nname with the Bill.\r\n\r\nAs was customary in such cases, all the local Governments had been\r\nconsulted; and they again consulted the Commissioners,\r\nDeputy-Commissioners, Collectors, etc., within their respective\r\nprovinces. The result was that Lord Ripon had before him the opinions of\r\npractically the whole Civil Service of India. Divers views were held as\r\nto the actual extent to which the law should be altered, but, in the\r\nwords of a despatch addressed by the Government of India to the\r\nSecretary of State on September 9, 1882, the local reports showed \"an\r\noverwhelming consensus of opinion that the time had come for modifying\r\nthe existing law and removing the present absolute bar upon the\r\ninvestment of native magistrates in the interior with powers over\r\nEuropean British subjects.\" Not one single official gave anything\r\napproaching an indication of the storm of opposition that this ill-fated\r\nmeasure was about to raise. I do not think that this is very\r\nsurprising, for the opposition came almost exclusively from the\r\nunofficial Europeans, who for the most part congregate in a few large\r\ncommercial centres, with the result that the majority of the civilians,\r\nwho are scattered throughout the country, are not much brought in\r\ncontact with them. Nevertheless, the fact that so great a miscalculation\r\nof the state of public opinion could be made left a deep impression on\r\nmy mind. The main lesson which I carried away from the Ilbert Bill\r\ncontroversy was, indeed, that in spite of their great merits, which no\r\none recognises more fully than myself, it is possible at times for the\r\nwhole body of Indian civilians, taken collectively, to be somewhat\r\nunsafe guides in matters of state policy. Curiously enough, the only\r\ndanger-signal which was raised was hoisted by Sir Henry Maine, who had\r\nbeen in India as Legal Member of Council, but who did not belong to the\r\nIndian Civil Service. He was at the time a member of the India Council.\r\nWhen the despatch of the Government of India on the subject reached\r\nLondon, Sir Henry Maine was travelling on the Continent. The papers were\r\nsent to him. He called to mind the bitter controversy which arose over\r\nwhat was known as \"the Black Act\" in Lord William Bentinck's time, and\r\nwrote privately a few words of warning to Lord Hartington, who was at\r\nthe time Secretary of State for India. Lord Hartington put the letter\r\nin his great-coat pocket, went to Newmarket, and forgot all about it,\r\nwith the result that Sir Henry Maine's warning never reached Lord Ripon.\r\n\r\nI well remember being present when Mr. Ilbert introduced the measure\r\ninto the Legislative Council. It attracted but little attention and led\r\nto only a very brief discussion, in which I took no part. The papers had\r\nbeen circulated to all Members of Council, including myself. When I\r\nreceived them I saw at a glance that the subject was not one that\r\nconcerned my own department, or one as to which my opinion could be of\r\nany value. I, therefore, merely endorsed the papers with my initials and\r\nsent them on, without having given the subject much attention. In common\r\nwith all my colleagues, I was soon to learn the gravity of the step\r\nwhich had been taken. A furious storm of opposition, which profoundly\r\nshook the prestige and authority of the Government of India, and notably\r\nof the Viceroy, arose. It was clear that a mistake had been made. The\r\nmeasure was in itself not very important. It was obviously undesirable,\r\nas Lyall remarked, to \"set fire to an important wing of the house in\r\norder to roast a healthy but small pig.\" The best plan, had it been\r\npossible, would have been to admit the mistake and to withdraw the\r\nmeasure; and this would certainly have been done had it not been for the\r\nunseemly and extravagant violence of the European unofficial community,\r\nnotably that of Calcutta. It should, however, in fairness be stated that\r\nthey were irritated and alarmed, not so much at the acts of Lord Ripon's\r\nGovernment, but at some rather indiscreet language which had at times\r\nbeen used, and which led them, quite erroneously, to suspect that\r\nextreme measures were in contemplation, of a nature calculated to shake\r\nthe foundations of British supremacy in India. This violent attitude\r\nnaturally led to reprisals and bitter recriminations from the native\r\npress, with the result that the total withdrawal of the measure would\r\nhave been construed as a decisive defeat to the adoption of even the\r\nmost moderate measures of liberal reform in India. The project of total\r\nwithdrawal could not, therefore, be entertained.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances, the duty of a practical rough-and-ready\r\npolitician was very clearly indicated. However little he might care for\r\nthe measure on its own merits, political instinct pointed unmistakably\r\nto the absolute necessity of affording strong support to the Viceroy.\r\nLyall failed to realise this fully. He admired Lord Ripon's courage. \"We\r\nmust,\" he said, \"all do our best to pull the Viceroy through.\" But\r\nwithal it is clear, by his own admission, that he only gave the Viceroy\r\n\"rather lukewarm support.\" \"I have intrenched myself,\" he wrote in a\r\ncharacteristic letter, \"behind cautious proposals, and am quoted on both\r\nsides.\" This attitude was not due to any want of moral courage, for a\r\nmore courageous man, both physically and morally, than Lyall never\r\nlived. It was simply the result of what Lord Lytton called \"the Lyall\r\nhabit of seeing both sides of a question,\" and not being able to decide\r\nbetimes which side to support. That a man of Lyall's philosophical and\r\nreflective turn of mind should see both sides of a question is not only\r\nnatural but commendable, but this frame of mind is not one that can be\r\nadopted without hazard by a man of action at the head of affairs at a\r\ntime of acute crisis.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a reverse side to this picture. The same mental\r\nattributes which rendered Lyall somewhat unfit, in my opinion, to deal\r\nwith an incident such as the Ilbert Bill episode, enabled him to come\r\nwith credit and distinction out of a situation of extreme difficulty in\r\nwhich the reputation of many another man would have foundered. I have no\r\nwish or intention to stir up again the embers of past Afghan\r\ncontroversies. It will be sufficient for my purpose to say that Lord\r\nLytton, immensely to his credit, recognised Lyall's abilities and\r\nappointed him Foreign Secretary, in spite of the fact that he was\r\nassociated with the execution of a policy to which Lord Lytton himself\r\nwas strongly opposed, and which he had decided to reverse. Lyall did not\r\nconceal his opinions, but, as always, he was open to conviction, and saw\r\nboth sides of a difficult question. In 1878, he was \"quite in favour of\r\nvigorous action to counteract the Russians\"; but two years later, in\r\n1880, after the Cavagnari murder, he records in a characteristic letter\r\nthat he \"was mentally edging back towards old John Lawrence's counsel\r\nnever to embark on the shoreless sea of Afghan politics.\" On the whole,\r\nit may be said that Lyall passed through this supreme test in a manner\r\nwhich would not have been possible to any man unless endowed not merely\r\nwith great abilities, but with the highest degree of moral courage and\r\nhonesty of purpose. He preserved his own self-esteem, and by his\r\nunswerving honesty and loyalty gained that of the partisans on both\r\nsides of the controversy.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to turn from these episodes to other features in Lyall's\r\ncareer and character, in respect to which unstinted eulogy, without the\r\nqualification of a shade of criticism, may be recorded. It was more\r\nespecially in dealing with the larger and more general aspects of\r\nEastern affairs that Lyall's genius shone most brightly. He had what\r\nthe French call a _flair_ in dealing with the main issues of Oriental\r\npolitics such as, so far as my experience goes, is possessed by few. It\r\nwas very similar to the qualities displayed by the late Lord Salisbury\r\nin dealing with foreign affairs generally. I give an instance in point.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, almost every newspaper in England was declaiming loudly about\r\nthe dangers to be apprehended if the rebellion excited by the Mahdi in\r\nthe Soudan was not promptly crushed. It was thought that this rebellion\r\nwas but the precursor of a general and formidable offensive movement\r\nthroughout the Islamic world. \"What,\" General Gordon, whose opinion at\r\nthe time carried great weight, had asked, \"is to prevent the Mahdi's\r\nadherents gaining Mecca? Once at Mecca we may look out for squalls in\r\nTurkey,\" etc. He, as also Lord Wolseley, insisted on the absolute\r\nnecessity of \"smashing the Mahdi.\" We now know that these fears were\r\nexaggerated, and that the Mahdist movement was of purely local\r\nimportance. Lyall had no special acquaintance with Egyptian or Soudanese\r\naffairs, but his general knowledge of the East and of Easterns enabled\r\nhim at once to gauge correctly the true nature of the danger.\r\nUndisturbed by the clamour which prevailed around him, he wrote to Mr.\r\nHenry Reeve on March 21, 1884: \"The Mahdi's fortunes do not interest\r\nIndia. The talk in some of the papers about the necessity of smashing\r\nhim, in order to avert the risk of some general Mahomedan uprising, is\r\nfutile and imaginative.\"[50]\r\n\r\nI need say no more. I am glad, for the sake of Lyall's own reputation,\r\nthat the offer of the Viceroyalty was never made to him. Apart from the\r\nquestion of his age, which, in 1894, was somewhat too advanced to admit\r\nof his undertaking such onerous duties, I doubt if he possessed\r\nsufficient experience of English public life--a qualification which is\r\nyearly becoming of greater importance--to enable him to fill the post in\r\na satisfactory manner. In spite, moreover, of his splendid intellectual\r\ngifts and moral elevation of thought, it is very questionable whether on\r\nthe whole he would have been the right man in the right place.\r\n\r\nLyall's name will not, like those of some other Indian notabilities, go\r\ndown to posterity as having been specially connected with any one\r\nepisode or event of supreme historical importance; but, when those of\r\nthe present generation who regarded him with esteem and affection have\r\npassed away, he will still deserve an important niche in the Temple of\r\nFame as a thinker who thoroughly understood the East, and who probably\r\ndid more than any of his contemporaries or predecessors to make his\r\ncountrymen understand and sympathise with the views held by the many\r\nmillions in India whose destinies are committed to their charge. His\r\nexperience and special mental equipment eminently fitted him to perform\r\nthe task he took in hand. England, albeit a prolific mother of great men\r\nin every department of thought and action, has not produced many Lyalls.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: _Nineteenth Century_, May 1913, p. 972.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: When I was at Delhi in 1881, a Nikolsaini, _i.e._ a\r\nworshipper of John Nicholson, came to see me.

Lord\r\nWolseley may justifiably be proud of the services which he has rendered\r\nto his country. The British nation, and its principal executive\r\nofficials in the past, may also be proud of having quickly discovered\r\nLord Wolseley's talents and merits, and of having advanced him to high\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nObviously, certain conclusions of public interest may be drawn from the\r\ncareer of this very distinguished soldier. Sir George Arthur, in the\r\nDecember number of the _Fortnightly Review_, has stated what are the\r\nspecial lessons which, in his opinion, are to be derived from a\r\nconsideration of that career.\r\n\r\nThose lessons are, indeed, sufficiently numerous. I propose, however, to\r\ndeal with only two of them. They are those which, apparently, Lord\r\nWolseley himself wishes to be inculcated. Both involve questions of\r\nprinciple of no little importance.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, Lord Wolseley, if I understand rightly, considers\r\nthat the army has suffered greatly from civilian interference. He\r\nappears to think that it should be more exclusively than heretofore\r\nunder military control.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, he thinks that, in certain cases, the political and\r\ndiplomatic negotiations, which generally follow on a war, should be\r\nconducted, not by a diplomatist or politician, but by the officer who\r\nhas conducted the previous military operations.\r\n\r\nAs regards the first point, I am not now dealing with Lord Wolseley's\r\nremarks in connection with our general unpreparedness for war, nor with\r\nthose on the various defects, past or present, of our military\r\norganisation. In a great deal that he has said on these subjects, Lord\r\nWolseley carries me heartily with him. I confine myself strictly to the\r\nissue as I have defined it above.\r\n\r\nPossibly, I have mistaken the significance of Lord Wolseley's words. If\r\nso, my error is shared by Sir George Arthur, who, in dealing with the\r\nWar Office, dwells with emphasis on the occasions when \"this great war\r\nexpert was thwarted in respect of his best considered plans by the\r\ncivilian element in that citadel of inefficiency,\"[52] and speaks with\r\napproval of Lord Wolseley's \"severe strictures on blundering civilian\r\ninterference with the army,\" as also of the \"censure reserved for the\r\ncriminal negligence and miserable cowardice of successive Cabinets.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that Lord Wolseley is rather hard on civilians in\r\ngeneral--those \"iconoclastic civilian officials who meddle and muddle in\r\narmy matters\"[53]--on politicians in particular, who, I cannot but\r\nthink, are not quite so black as he has painted them; and most of all on\r\nSecretaries of State, with the single exception of Lord Cardwell, to\r\nwhom generous and very well deserved praise is accorded.\r\n\r\nIt is not quite clear, from a perusal of these volumes, what is the\r\nprecise nature of the change which Lord Wolseley wishes to advocate,\r\nalthough in one passage a specific proposal is made. It is that \"a\r\ncertificate should be annually laid before Parliament by the\r\nnon-political Commander-in-Chief, that the whole of the military forces\r\nof the Empire can be completely and effectively equipped for war in a\r\nfortnight.\" The general tendency of the reform which commends itself to\r\nLord Wolseley may, however, readily be inferred. He complains that the\r\nsoldiers, \"though in office, are never in power.\" Nevertheless, as he\r\nexplains with military frankness, \"the cunning politician,\" when\r\nanything goes wrong, is able \"to turn the wrath of a deceived people\r\nupon the military authorities, and those who are exclusively to blame\r\nare too often allowed to sneak off unhurt in the turmoil of execration\r\nthey have raised against the soldiers.\" I may remark incidentally that\r\nexception might perhaps reasonably be taken to the use of the word\r\n\"exclusively\" in this passage; but the main point to which I wish to\r\ndraw attention is that clearly, in Lord Wolseley's opinion, the\r\nsoldiers, under the existing system, have not sufficient power, and that\r\nit would be advisable that they should, under a reformed system, be\r\ninvested with more ample power. I dare say Lord Wolseley is quite right,\r\nat all events to this extent, that it is desirable that the power, as\r\nalso the responsibility, of the highest military authorities should be\r\nas clearly defined as is possible under our peculiar system of\r\ngovernment. But it is essential to ascertain more accurately in what\r\nmanner Lord Wolseley, speaking with all the high authority which\r\ndeservedly attaches itself to his name, thinks that effect should be\r\ngiven to the principle which he advocates. In order to obtain this\r\ninformation, I turn to vol. i. p. 92, where I find the following\r\npassage: \"A man who is not a soldier, and who is entirely ignorant of\r\nwar, is selected solely for political reasons to be Secretary of State\r\nfor War. I might with quite as great propriety be selected to be the\r\nchief surgeon in a hospital.\"\r\n\r\nI would here digress for a moment to deal with the argument advanced in\r\nthe latter part of this sentence. It is very plausible, and, at first\r\nsight, appears convincing. It is also very commonly used. Over and over\r\nagain, I have heard the presumed analogy between the surgeon and the\r\nsoldier advanced as a proof of the absurdity of the English system. I\r\nbelieve that no such analogy exists. Surgery is an exact science. To\r\nperform even the most trifling surgical operation requires careful\r\ntechnical training and experience. It is far otherwise with the case of\r\nthe soldier. I do not suppose that any civilian in his senses would\r\npresume, on a purely technical matter, to weigh his own opinion against\r\nthat of a trained soldier, like Lord Wolseley, who is thoroughly versed\r\nin the theory of his profession, and who has been through the school of\r\nactual war. But a large number of the most important questions affecting\r\nmilitary organisation and the conduct of military affairs, require for\r\ntheir solution little or no technical knowledge. Any man of ordinary\r\ncommon sense can form an opinion on them, and any man of good business\r\nhabits may readily become a capable agent for giving effect to the\r\nopinions which he, or which others have formed.\r\n\r\nI may here perhaps give a page from my own personal experience bearing\r\non the point under discussion.\r\n\r\nThe Soudan campaign of 1896-98 was, in official circles, dubbed a\r\n\"Foreign Office war.\" For a variety of reasons, to which it is\r\nunnecessary to allude in detail, the Sirdar was, from the commencement\r\nof the operations, placed exclusively under my orders in all matters.\r\nThe War Office assumed no responsibility, and issued no orders.[54] A\r\ncorresponding position was occupied by the Headquarters Staff of the\r\nArmy of Occupation in Cairo. The result was that I found myself in the\r\nsomewhat singular position of a civilian, who had had some little\r\nmilitary training in his youth, but who had had no experience of\r\nwar,[55] whose proper functions were diplomacy and administration, but\r\nwho, under the stress of circumstances in the Land of Paradox, had to be\r\nultimately responsible for the maintenance, and even, to some extent,\r\nfor the movements of an army of some 25,000 men in the field.\r\n\r\nThat good results were obtained under this system cannot be doubted. It\r\nwill not, therefore, be devoid of interest to explain how it worked in\r\npractice, and what were the main reasons which contributed towards\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nI have no wish to disparage the strategical and tactical ability which\r\nwere displayed in the conduct of the campaign. It is, however, a fact\r\nthat no occasion arose for the display of any great skill in these\r\nbranches of military knowledge. When once the British and Egyptian\r\ntroops were brought face to face with the enemy, there could--unless\r\nthe conditions under which they fought were altogether extraordinary--be\r\nlittle doubt of the result. The speedy and successful issue of the\r\ncampaign depended, in fact, almost entirely upon the methods adopted for\r\novercoming the very exceptional difficulties connected with the supply\r\nand transport of the troops. The main quality required to meet these\r\ndifficulties was a good head for business. By one of those fortunate\r\naccidents which have been frequent in the history of Anglo-Saxon\r\nenterprise, a man was found equal to the occasion. Lord Kitchener of\r\nKhartoum won his well-deserved peerage because he was a good man of\r\nbusiness; he looked carefully after all important detail, and he\r\nenforced economy.\r\n\r\nMy own merits, such as they were, were of a purely negative character.\r\nThey may be summed up in a single phrase. I abstained from mischievous\r\nactivity, and I acted as a check on the interference of others. I had\r\nfull confidence in the abilities of the commander, whom I had\r\npractically myself chosen, and, except when he asked for my assistance,\r\nI left him entirely alone. I encouraged him to pay no attention to those\r\nvexatious bureaucratic formalities with which, under the slang phrase of\r\n\"red tape\" our military system is overburdened. I exercised some little\r\ncontrol over the demands for stores which were sent to the London War\r\nOffice; and the mere fact that these demands passed through my hands,\r\nand that I declined to forward any request unless, besides being in\r\naccordance with existing regulations--a point to which I attached but\r\nslight importance--it had been authorised by the Sirdar, probably tended\r\nto check wastefulness in that quarter where it was most to be feared.\r\nBeyond this I did nothing, and I found--somewhat to my own\r\nastonishment--that, with my ordinary staff of four diplomatic\r\nsecretaries, the general direction of a war of no inconsiderable\r\ndimensions added but little to my ordinary labours.\r\n\r\nI do not say that this system would always work as successfully as was\r\nthe case during the Khartoum campaign. The facts, as I have already\r\nsaid, were peculiar. The commander, on whom everything practically\r\ndepended, was a man of marked military and administrative ability.\r\nNevertheless, I feel certain that Lord Kitchener would bear me out in\r\nsaying that here was a case in which general civilian control, far from\r\nexercising any detrimental effect, was on the whole beneficial.\r\n\r\nTo return to the main thread of my argument. The passage which I have\r\nquoted from Lord Wolseley's book would certainly appear to point to the\r\nconclusion that, in his opinion, the Secretary of State for War should\r\nbe a soldier unconnected with politics. Even although Lord Wolseley does\r\nnot state this conclusion in so many words, it is notorious to any one\r\nwho is familiar with the views current in army circles that the adoption\r\nof this plan is considered by many to be the best, if it be not the\r\nonly, solution of all our military difficulties.\r\n\r\nI am not concerned with the constitutional objections which may be urged\r\nagainst the change of system now under discussion. Neither need I dwell\r\non the difficulty of making it harmonise with our system of party\r\ngovernment, for which it is quite possible to entertain a certain\r\nfeeling of respect and admiration without being in any degree a\r\npolitical partisan. I approach the question exclusively from the point\r\nof view of its effects on the army. From that point of view, I venture\r\nto think that the change is to be deprecated.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with Lord Cardwell's attitude in respect to army reform, Lord\r\nWolseley says: \"Never was Minister in my time more generally hated by\r\nthe army.\" He points out how this hatred was extended to all who\r\nsupported Lord Cardwell's views. His own conduct was \"looked upon as a\r\nspecies of high treason.\" I was at the time employed in a subordinate\r\nposition at the War Office. I can testify that this language is by no\r\nmeans exaggerated. Nevertheless, after events showed clearly enough\r\nthat, in resisting the abolition of purchase, the formation of a\r\nreserve, and the other admirable reforms with which Lord Cardwell's\r\nname, equally with that of Lord Wolseley, is now honourably associated,\r\nthe bulk of army opinion was wholly in the wrong. I believe such army\r\nopinion as now objects to a civilian being Secretary of State for War to\r\nbe equally in the wrong.\r\n\r\nThere would appear, indeed, to be some inconsistency between Lord\r\nWolseley's unstinted praise of Lord Cardwell--that \"greatest\" of War\r\nMinisters, who, \"though absolutely ignorant of our army and of war,\"\r\nresponded so \"readily to the demands made on him by his military\r\nadvisers,\" and \"gave new life to our old army\"--and his depreciation of\r\nthe system which gave official birth to Lord Cardwell. There would be no\r\ncontradiction in the two positions if the civilian Minister, in 1871,\r\nhad been obliged to use his position in Parliament and his influence on\r\npublic opinion to force on an unwilling nation reforms which were\r\ngenerally advocated by the army. But the very contrary of this was the\r\ncase. What Lord Cardwell had principally to encounter was \"the fierce\r\nhatred\" of the old school of soldiers, and Lord Wolseley tells us\r\nclearly enough what would have happened to the small band of army\r\nreformers within the army, if they had been unable to rely on civilian\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n     \"Had it not been,\" he says, \"for Mr. Cardwell's and Lord\r\n     Northbrook's constant support and encouragement, those of us who\r\n     were bold enough to advocate a thorough reorganisation of our\r\n     military system, would have been 'provided for' in distant quarters\r\n     of the British world, 'where no mention of us more should be\r\n     heard.'\"\r\n\r\nThere can be no such thing as finality in army reform. There will be\r\nreformers in the future, as there have been in the past. There will,\r\nwithout doubt, be vested interests and conservative instincts to be\r\novercome in the future, as there were at the time when Lord Wolseley so\r\ngallantly fought the battle of army reform. What guarantee can Lord\r\nWolseley afford that a soldier at the head of the army will always be a\r\nreformer, and that he will not \"provide for\" those of his subordinates\r\nwho have the courage to raise their voices in favour of reform, even as\r\nLord Wolseley thinks he would himself have been \"provided for\" had it\r\nnot been for the sturdy support he received from his civilian superiors?\r\nI greatly doubt the possibility of giving any such guarantee.\r\n\r\nBut I go further than this. It is now more than thirty years since I\r\nserved under the War Office. I am, therefore, less intimately acquainted\r\nwith the present than with the past. But, during those thirty years, I\r\nhave been constantly brought in contact with the War Office, and I have\r\nseen no reason whatever to change the opinion I formed in Lord\r\nCardwell's time, namely, that it will be an evil day for the army when\r\nit is laid down, as a system, that no civilian should be Secretary of\r\nState for War. My belief is that, if ever the history of our military\r\nadministration of recent years comes to be impartially written, it will\r\nbe found that most of the large reforms, which have beneficially\r\naffected the army, have been warmly supported, and sometimes initiated,\r\nby the superior civilian element in the War Office. Who, indeed, ever\r\nheard of a profession being reformed from within? One of the greatest\r\nlaw reformers of the last century was the author of _Bleak House_.\r\n\r\nIt may, indeed, be urged--perhaps Lord Wolseley would himself urge--that\r\nit is no defence of a bad system to say that under one man (Lord\r\nCardwell), whom Lord Wolseley describes as \"a clear-headed,\r\nlogical-minded lawyer,\" it worked very well. To this I reply that I\r\ncannot believe that the race of clear-headed, logical-minded individuals\r\nof Cabinet rank, belonging to either great party of the State, is\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\nI have been induced to make these remarks because, in past years, I was\r\na good deal associated with army reform, and because, since then, I have\r\ncontinued to take an interest in the matter. Also because I am convinced\r\nthat those officers in the army who, with the best intentions, advocate\r\nthe particular change now under discussion, are making a mistake in army\r\ninterests. They may depend upon it that the cause they have at heart\r\nwill best be furthered by maintaining at the head of the army a civilian\r\nof intelligence and of good business habits, who, although, equally with\r\na soldier, he may sometimes make mistakes, will give an impartial\r\nhearing to army reformers, and will probably be more alive than any one\r\nbelonging to their own profession to all that is best in the outside and\r\nparliamentary pressure to which he is exposed.\r\n\r\nI turn to the second point to which allusion was made at the\r\ncommencement of this article.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Chinese war in 1860, Lord Wolseley says: \"In treating\r\nwith barbarian nations during a war ... the general to command the army\r\nand the ambassador to make peace should be one and the same man. To\r\nseparate the two functions is, according to my experience, folly gone\r\nmad.\" Lord Wolseley reverts to this subject in describing the Ashantee\r\nwar of 1873-74. I gather from his allusions to Sir John Moore's\r\ncampaign in Spain, and to the fact that evil results ensued from\r\nallowing Dutch deputies to accompany Marlborough's army, that he is in\r\nfavour of extending the principle which he advocates to wars other than\r\nthose waged against \"barbarian nations.\"\r\n\r\nThe objections to anything in the nature of a division of\r\nresponsibility, at all events so long as military operations are in\r\nactual progress, are, indeed, obvious, and are now very generally\r\nrecognised. Those who are familiar with the history of the revolutionary\r\nwar will remember the baneful influence exercised by the Aulic Council\r\nover the actions of the Austrian commanders.[56] There can, in fact, be\r\nlittle doubt that circumstances may occur when the principle advocated\r\nby Lord Wolseley may most advantageously be adopted; but it is, I\r\nventure to think, one which has to be applied with much caution,\r\nespecially when the question is not whether there should be a temporary\r\ncessation of hostilities--a point on which the view of the officer in\r\ncommand of the troops would naturally carry the greatest weight--but\r\nalso involves the larger issue of the terms on which peace should\r\nfinally be concluded. I am not at all sure that, in deciding on the\r\nissues which, under the latter contingency, must necessarily come under\r\nconsideration, the employment of a soldier, in preference to a\r\npolitician or diplomatist, is always a wise proceeding. Soldiers,\r\nequally with civilians, are liable to make erroneous forecasts of the\r\nfuture, and to mistake the general situation with which they have to\r\ndeal. I can give a case in point.\r\n\r\nWhen, in January 1885, Khartoum fell, the question whether the British\r\narmy should be withdrawn, or should advance and reconquer the Soudan,\r\nhad to be decided. Gordon, whose influence on public opinion, great\r\nbefore, had been enhanced by his tragic death, had strongly recommended\r\nthe policy of \"smashing the Mahdi.\" Lord Wolseley adopted Gordon's\r\nopinion. \"No frontier force,\" he said, \"can keep Mahdiism out of Egypt,\r\nand the Mahdi sooner or later must be smashed, or he will smash you.\"\r\nThese views were shared by Lord Kitchener, Sir Redvers Buller, Sir\r\nCharles Wilson, and by the military authorities generally.[57] Further,\r\nthe alleged necessity of \"smashing the Mahdi,\" on the ground that his\r\nsuccess in the Soudan would be productive of serious results elsewhere,\r\nexercised a powerful influence on British public opinion at this period,\r\nalthough the best authorities on Eastern politics were at the time aware\r\nthat the fears so generally entertained in this connection were either\r\ngroundless or, at all events, greatly exaggerated.[58] Under these\r\ncircumstances, it was decided to \"smash the Mahdi,\" and accordingly a\r\nproclamation, giving effect to the declared policy of the British\r\nGovernment, was issued. Shortly afterwards, the Penjdeh incident\r\noccurred. Public opinion in England somewhat calmed down, having found\r\nits natural safety-valve in an acrimonious parliamentary debate, in\r\nwhich the Government narrowly escaped defeat. The voices of politicians\r\nand diplomatists, which had been to some degree hushed by the din of\r\narms, began to be heard. The proclamation was cancelled. The project of\r\nreconquering the Soudan was postponed to a more convenient period. It\r\nwas, in fact, accomplished thirteen years later, under circumstances\r\nwhich differed very materially from those which prevailed in 1885. In\r\nJune 1885, the Government of Lord Salisbury succeeded to that of Mr.\r\nGladstone, and, though strongly urged to undertake the reconquest of the\r\nSoudan, confirmed the decision of its predecessors.\r\n\r\nSir George Arthur, writing in the _Fortnightly Review_, strongly\r\ncondemns this \"cynical disavowal\" of Lord Wolseley's proclamation. I\r\nhave nothing to say in favour of the issue of that proclamation. I am\r\nvery clearly of opinion that, as it was issued, it was wise that it\r\nshould be cancelled. For, in truth, subsequent events showed that the\r\nforecast made by Lord Wolseley and by Gordon was erroneous, in that it\r\ncredited the Mahdi with a power of offence which he was far from\r\npossessing. No serious difficulty arose in defending the frontier of\r\nEgypt from Dervish attack. The overthrow of the Mahdi's power, though\r\neminently desirable, was very far from constituting an imperious\r\nnecessity such as was commonly supposed to exist in 1885. In this\r\ninstance, therefore, it appears to me that the diplomatists and\r\npoliticians gauged the true nature of the situation somewhat more\r\naccurately than the soldiers.\r\n\r\nMore than this, I conceive that, in all civilised countries, the theory\r\nof government is that a question of peace or war is one to be decided by\r\npoliticians. The functions of the soldier are supposed to be confined,\r\nin the first place, to advising on the purely military aspects of the\r\nissue involved; and, in the second place, to giving effect to any\r\ndecisions at which the Government may arrive. The practice in this\r\nmatter not infrequently differs somewhat from the theory. The soldier,\r\nwho is generally prone to advocate vigorous action, is inclined to\r\nencroach on the sphere which should properly be reserved for the\r\npolitician. The former is often masterful, and the latter may be dazzled\r\nby the glitter of arms, or too readily lured onwards by the persuasive\r\nvoice of some strategist to acquire an almost endless succession of\r\nwhat, in technical language, are called \"keys\" to some position, or--to\r\nemploy a metaphor of which the late Lord Salisbury once made use in\r\nwriting to me--\"to try and annex the moon in order to prevent its being\r\nappropriated by the planet Mars.\" When this happens, a risk is run that\r\nthe soldier, who is himself unconsciously influenced by a very laudable\r\ndesire to obtain personal distinction, may practically dictate the\r\npolicy of the nation without taking a sufficiently comprehensive view of\r\nnational interests. Considerations of this nature have more especially\r\nbeen, from time to time, advanced in connection with the numerous\r\nfrontier wars which have occurred in India. That they contain a certain\r\nelement of truth can scarcely be doubted.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, it appears to me that the application of the\r\nprinciple advocated by Lord Wolseley requires much care and\r\nwatchfulness. Probably, the wisest plan will be that each case should be\r\ndecided on its own merits with reference to the special circumstances\r\nof the situation, which may sometimes demand the fusion, and sometimes\r\nthe separation, of military and political functions.\r\n\r\nI was talking, a short time ago, to a very intelligent, and also\r\nAnglophile, French friend of mine. He knew England well, but, until\r\nquite recently, had not visited the country for a few years. He told me\r\nthat what struck him most was the profound change which had come over\r\nBritish opinion since the occasion of his last visit. We had been\r\ninvaded, he said, by _le militarisme continental_. In common with the\r\nvast majority of my countrymen, I am earnestly desirous of seeing our\r\nmilitary organisation and military establishments placed on a thoroughly\r\nsound footing, but I have no wish whatever to see any portion of our\r\ninstitutions overwhelmed by a wave of _militarisme continental_. It is\r\nbecause I think that the views advocated by Lord Wolseley\r\ntend--although, I do not doubt, unconsciously to their distinguished\r\nauthor--in the direction of a somewhat too pronounced _militarisme_,\r\nthat I venture in some degree to differ from one for whom I have for\r\nmany years entertained the highest admiration and the most cordial\r\npersonal esteem.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: _The Story of a Soldier's Life_. Field-Marshal Viscount\r\nWolseley. Constable.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: After carefully reading the book, I am in doubt as to the\r\nspecific occasions to which allusion is here made.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: This expression is used with reference to a warning to\r\ncivilians that they should \"keep their hands off the regiment.\" I do not\r\nknow if any recent instances have occurred when civilians have wished to\r\ntouch the essential portions of what is known as the \"regimental\r\nsystem,\" but I have a very distinct recollection of the fact that this\r\naccusation was very freely, and very unjustly, brought against the army\r\nreformers in Lord Cardwell's time. Of these, Lord Wolseley was certainly\r\nthe most distinguished. I think he will bear me out in the assertion\r\nthat it was only by civilian support that, in the special instances to\r\nwhich I allude, the opposition was overcome.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: Much the same proceeding appears to have been adopted in\r\nthe Red River expedition, which was conducted with such eminent success\r\nby Lord Wolseley in 1870. But there was a difference. Lord Wolseley, in\r\ndescribing that expedition, says: \"The Cabinet and parliamentary element\r\nin the War Office, that has marred so many a good military scheme, had,\r\nI may say, little or nothing to do with it from first to last. When will\r\ncivilian Secretaries of State for War cease from troubling in war\r\naffairs?\" In the case of the Soudan campaigns, on the other hand, Lord\r\nKitchener and I had to rely--and our reliance was not misplaced--on the\r\nCabinet and on the parliamentary elements of the Government, to prevent\r\nexcessive interference from the London offices.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: I was present for a few weeks, as a spectator, with\r\nGrant's army at the siege of Petersburg in 1864, but the experience was\r\ntoo short to be of much value.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: _Art of War_, Jomini, p. 59.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: I think I am correct in saying that Sir Evelyn Wood was of\r\na contrary opinion, but I have been unable to verify this statement by\r\nreference to any contemporaneous document.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: On the 21st of March 1884 Sir Alfred Lyall wrote to Mr.\r\nHenry Reeve: \"The Mahdi's fortunes do not interest India. The talk in\r\nsome of the papers about the necessity of smashing him, in order to\r\navert the risk of some general Mahomedan uprising, is futile and\r\nimaginative.\"--_Memoirs of Henry Reeve_, vol. ii. p. 329.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS OF FREE TRADE\r\n\r\nPAPER READ AT THE INTERNATIONAL FREE TRADE CONGRESS AT ANTWERP,\r\n_August 9-21, 1910_[59]\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been asked to state my opinion on the effect of Free Trade upon\r\nthe political relations between States. The subject is a very wide one.\r\nI am fully aware that the brief remarks which I am about to make fail to\r\ndo justice to it.\r\n\r\nA taunt very frequently levelled at modern Free Traders is that the\r\nanticipations of their predecessors in respect to the influence which\r\nFree Trade would be likely to exercise on international relations have\r\nnot been realised. A single extract from Mr. Cobden's writings will\r\nsuffice to show the nature of those anticipations. In 1842, he described\r\nFree Trade \"as the best human means for securing universal and permanent\r\npeace.\"[60] Inasmuch as numerous wars have occurred since this opinion\r\nwas expressed, it is often held that events have falsified Mr. Cobden's\r\nprediction.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with this argument, I have, in the first place, to remark\r\nthat modern Free Traders are under no sort of obligation to be\r\n\"Cobdenite\" to the extent of adopting or defending the whole of the\r\nteaching of the so-called Manchester School. It may readily be admitted\r\nthat the programme of that school is, in many respects, inadequate to\r\ndeal with modern problems.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, I wish to point out that Mr. Cobden and his\r\nassociates, whilst rightly holding that trade was to some extent the\r\nnatural foe to war, appear to me to have pushed the consequences to be\r\nderived from that argument much too far. They allowed too little for\r\nother causes which tend to subvert peace, such as racial and religious\r\ndifferences, dynastic considerations, the wish to acquire national\r\nunity, which tends to the agglomeration of small States, and the\r\nambition which excites the desire of hegemony.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, I have to observe that the world has not as yet had\r\nany adequate opportunity for judging of the accuracy or inaccuracy of\r\nMr. Cobden's prediction, for only one great commercial nation has, up to\r\nthe present time, adopted a policy of Free Trade. It was, indeed, here\r\nmore than in any other direction that some of the early British Free\r\nTraders erred on the side of excessive optimism.[61] They thought, and\r\nrightly thought, that Free Trade would confer enormous benefits on their\r\nown country; and they held that the object-lesson thus afforded might\r\nvery probably induce other nations speedily to follow the example of\r\nEngland. They forgot that the special conditions which existed at the\r\ntime their noble aspirations were conceived were liable to change; that\r\nthe extraordinary advantages which Free Trade for a time secured were\r\nlargely due to the fact that seventy years ago England possessed a far\r\nlarger supply of mechanical aptitude than any other country; that her\r\nmarked commercial supremacy, which was then practically undisputed,\r\ncould not be fully maintained in the face of the advance likely to be\r\nmade by other nations; that if those nations persisted in adhering to\r\nProtection, their progress--which has really been achieved, not by\r\nreason of, but in spite of Protection--would almost inevitably be\r\nmainly attributed to their fiscal policy to the exclusion of other\r\ncontributory causes, such as education; and that thus a revived demand\r\nfor protective measures would not improbably arise, even in England\r\nitself. These are, in fact, the results which have accrued. Without\r\ndoubt, it was difficult to foresee them, but it is worthy of note that,\r\nin spite of all adverse and possibly ephemeral appearances, symptoms are\r\nnot wanting which encourage the belief that the prescience of the early\r\nFree Traders may, in the end, be tardily vindicated. It is the irony of\r\ncurrent politics that at a time when England is meditating a return to\r\nProtection--but is as yet, I am glad to say, very far from being\r\npersuaded that the adoption of such a policy would be wise--the most\r\nadvanced thinkers in some Protectionist states are beginning to turn\r\ntheir eyes towards the possibility and desirability of casting aside\r\nthose swaddling-clothes which were originally assumed in order to foster\r\ntheir budding industries. Many of the most competent German economists,\r\nwhilst advocating Protection as a temporary measure, have for many years\r\nfully recognised that, when once a country has firmly established its\r\nindustrial and commercial status in the markets of the world, it can\r\nbest maintain and extend its acquired position by permitting the freest\r\npossible trade. Even Friedrich List, though an ardent Protectionist,\r\n\"always had before him universal Free Trade as the goal of his\r\nendeavours.\"[62] Before long, Germany will have well-nigh completed the\r\ntransition from agriculture to manufactures in which she has been\r\nengaged for the last thirty or forty years; and when that transition is\r\nfully accomplished, it may be predicted with some degree of confidence\r\nthat a nation so highly educated, and endowed with so keen a perception\r\nof cause and effect, will begin to move in the direction of Free Trade.\r\nSimilarly, in the United States of America, the campaign which has\r\nrecently been waged against the huge Trusts, which are the offspring of\r\nProtection, as well as the rising complaints of the dearness of living,\r\nare so many indications that arguments, which must eventually lead to\r\nthe consideration--and probably to the ultimate adoption--if not of Free\r\nTrade, at all events of Freer Trade than now prevails, are gradually\r\ngaining ground. Much the same may be said of Canada. A Canadian\r\ngentleman, who can speak with authority on the subject, recently wrote:\r\n\r\n     The feeling in favour of Free Trade is growing fast in Western\r\n     Canada, and I believe I am right in adding the United States.\r\n\r\n     We have our strong and rapidly growing farmers' organisations, such\r\n     as the United Farmers of Alberta, and of each Western province, so\r\n     that farmers are now making themselves heard and felt in politics,\r\n     and farmers realise that they are being exploited for the benefit\r\n     of the manufacturer. Excellent articles appear almost weekly in the\r\n     _Grain Growers' Guide_, published in Winnipeg, showing the curse of\r\n     Protection.\r\n\r\n     A Canadian Free Trade Union, affiliated with the International Free\r\n     Trade League, has just been formed in Winnipeg, and many prominent\r\n     business and professional men are connected with it.\r\n\r\n     It ought to be better known among the electors of Great Britain how\r\n     Free Trade is growing in Canada, that they may be less inclined to\r\n     commit the fatal mistake of changing England's policy. Canada is\r\n     often quoted in English politics now, and the real facts should be\r\n     known.\r\n\r\nNo experience has, therefore, as yet been acquired which would enable a\r\nmatured judgment to be formed as to the extent to which Free Trade may\r\nbe regarded as a preventive to war. The question remains substantially\r\nmuch in the same condition as it was seventy years ago. In forming an\r\nopinion upon it, we have still to rely largely on conjecture and on\r\nacademic considerations. All that has been proved is that numerous wars\r\nhave taken place during a period of history when Protection was the\r\nrule, and Free Trade the exception; though the _post hoc ergo propter\r\nhoc_ fallacy would, of course, be involved, if on that account it were\r\ninferred that the protection of national industries has necessarily\r\nbeen the chief cause of war.\r\n\r\nWithout indulging in any utopian dreams as to the possibility of\r\ninaugurating an era of universal peace, it may, I think, be held that,\r\nin spite of the wars which have occurred during the last half century,\r\nnot merely an ardent desire for peace, but also a dislike--I may almost\r\nsay a genuine horror--of war has grown apace amongst the civilised\r\nnations of the world. The destructiveness of modern weapons of offence,\r\nthe fearful personal responsibility devolving on the individuals who\r\norder the first shot to be fired, the complete uncertainty which\r\nprevails as to the naval, military, and political results which will\r\nensue if the huge armaments of modern States are brought into collision,\r\nthe growth of a benevolent, if at times somewhat eccentric\r\nhumanitarianism, possibly also the advance of democracy--though it is at\r\ntimes somewhat too readily assumed that democracies must of necessity be\r\npeaceful--have all contributed to create a public opinion which holds\r\nthat to engage in an avoidable war is the worst of political crimes.\r\nThis feeling has found expression in the more ready recourse which, as\r\ncompared to former times, is now made to arbitration in order to settle\r\ninternational disputes. Nevertheless, so long as human nature remains\r\nunchanged, and more especially so long as the huge armaments at present\r\nexisting are maintained, it is the imperative duty of every\r\nself-respecting nation to provide adequately for its own defence. That\r\nduty is more especially imposed on those nations who, for one reason or\r\nanother, have been driven into adopting that policy of expansion, which\r\nis now almost universal. Within the last few years, the United States of\r\nAmerica have abandoned what has been aptly termed their former system of\r\n\"industrial monasticism,\"[63] whilst in the Far East a new world-power\r\nhas suddenly sprung into existence. Speaking as one unit belonging to a\r\ncountry whose dominions are more extensive and more widely dispersed\r\nthan those of any other nation, I entertain a strong opinion that if\r\nGreat Britain continues to maintain her present policy of Free Trade--as\r\nI trust will be the case--her means of defence should, within the limits\r\nof human foresight, be such as to render her empire impregnable; and,\r\nfurther, that should that policy unfortunately be reversed, it will be a\r\nwise precaution that those means of defence should, if possible, be\r\nstill further strengthened. But I also entertain an equally strong\r\nopinion that an imperial nation should seek to fortify its position and\r\nto provide guarantees for the durability of its empire, not merely by\r\nrendering itself, so far as is possible, impregnable, but also by using\r\nits vast world-power in such a manner as to secure in some degree the\r\nmoral acquiescence of other nations in its _imperium_, and thus provide\r\nan antidote--albeit it may only be a partial antidote--against the\r\njealousy and emulation which its extensive dominions are calculated to\r\nincite.\r\n\r\nI am aware that an argument of this sort is singularly liable to\r\nmisrepresentation. Militant patriotism rejects it with scorn. It is said\r\nto involve an ignoble degree of truckling to foreign nations. It\r\ninvolves nothing of the kind. I should certainly be the last to\r\nrecommend anything approaching to pusillanimity in the conduct of the\r\nforeign affairs of my country. If I thought that the introduction of a\r\npolicy of Protection was really demanded in the interests of the\r\ninhabitants of the United Kingdom, I should warmly advocate it, whatever\r\nmight be the effect produced on the public opinion of other countries.\r\nBritish Free Traders do not advocate the cause which they have at heart\r\nin order to benefit the countries which send their goods to Great\r\nBritain, but because they think it advantageous to their own country to\r\nprocure certain foreign products without any artificial enhancement of\r\nprice.[64] If they are right in coming to this conclusion, it is surely\r\nan incidental advantage of much importance that a policy of Free Trade,\r\nbesides being advantageous to the United Kingdom, tends to give an\r\nadditional element of stability to the British Empire and to preserve\r\nthe peace of the world.\r\n\r\nFrom the dawn of history, uncontrolled commercialism has been one of the\r\nprincipal causes of misgovernment, and more especially of the\r\nmisgovernment of subject races. The early history of the Spaniards in\r\nSouth and Central America, as well as the more recent history of other\r\nStates, testify to the truth of this generalisation. Similarly,\r\nTrade--that is to say exclusive trade--far from tending to promote\r\npeace, has not infrequently been accompanied by aggression, and has\r\nrather tended to promote war. Tariff wars, which are the natural outcome\r\nof the protective system, have been of frequent occurrence, and,\r\nalthough I am not at all prepared to admit that under no circumstances\r\nis a policy of retaliation justifiable, it is certain that that policy,\r\ncarried to excess, has at times endangered European peace. There is\r\nample proof that the Tariff war between Russia and Germany in 1893, \"was\r\nregarded by both responsible parties as likely to lead to a state of\r\nthings dangerous to the peace of Europe.\"[65] Professor Dietzel, in his\r\nvery remarkable and exhaustive work on _Retaliatory Duties_, shows very\r\nclearly that the example of Tariff wars is highly contagious. Speaking\r\nof the events which occurred in 1902 and subsequent years, he says:\r\n\"Germany set the bad example.... Russia, Austria-Hungary, Roumania,\r\nSwitzerland, Portugal, Holland, Servia, followed suit.... An\r\ninternational arming epidemic broke out. Everywhere, indeed, it was\r\nsaid: We are not at all desirous of a Tariff war. We are acting only on\r\nthe maxim so often proclaimed among us, _Si vis pacem, para bellum_.\"\r\n\r\nCan it be doubted that there is a distinct connection between these\r\nTariff wars and the huge armaments which are now maintained by every\r\nEuropean state? The connection is, in fact, very close. Tariff wars\r\nengender the belief that wars carried on by shot and shell may not\r\nimprobably follow. They thus encourage, and even necessitate, the costly\r\npreparations for war which weigh so heavily, not only on the\r\nindustries, but also on the moral and intellectual progress of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nMr. Oliver, in his interesting biography of Alexander Hamilton, gives a\r\nvery remarkable instance of the menace to peace arising, even amongst a\r\nwholly homogeneous community, from the creation of hostile tariffs. The\r\nfirst step which the thirteen States of America took after they had\r\nacquired their independence was \"to indulge themselves in the costly\r\nluxury of an internecine tariff war.... Pennsylvania attacked Delaware.\r\nConnecticut was oppressed by Rhode Island and New York.... It was a\r\ndangerous game, ruinous in itself, and, behind the Custom-House\r\nofficers, men were beginning to furbish up the locks of their\r\nmuskets.... At one time war between Vermont, New Hampshire, and New York\r\nseemed all but inevitable.\"\r\n\r\nTo sum up all I have to say on this subject--I do not for a moment\r\nsuppose that Universal Free Trade--even if the adoption of such a policy\r\nwere conceivable--would inaugurate an era of universal and permanent\r\npeace. Whatever fiscal policy be adopted by the great commercial nations\r\nof the world, it is wholly illusory to suppose that the risk of war can\r\nbe altogether avoided in the future, any more than has been the case in\r\nthe past. But I am equally certain that, whereas exclusive trade tends\r\nto exacerbate international relations, Free Trade, by mutually\r\nenlisting a number of influential material interests in the cause of\r\npeace, tends to ameliorate those relations and thus, _pro tanto_, to\r\ndiminish the probability of war. No nation has, of course, the least\r\nright to dictate the fiscal policy of its neighbours, neither has it any\r\nlegitimate cause to complain when its neighbours exercise their\r\nunquestionable right to make whatever fiscal arrangements they consider\r\nconducive to their own interests. But the real and ostensible causes of\r\nwar are not always identical. When once irritation begins to rankle, and\r\nrival interests clash to an excessive degree, the guns are apt to go off\r\nby themselves, and an adroit diplomacy may confidently be trusted to\r\ndiscover some plausible pretext for their explosion.\r\n\r\nIn a speech which I made in London some three years ago, I gave an\r\nexample, gathered from facts with which I was intimately acquainted, of\r\nthe pacifying influence exerted by adopting a policy of Free Trade in\r\nthe execution of a policy of expansion. I may as well repeat it now.\r\nSome twelve years ago the British flag was hoisted in the Soudan side by\r\nside with the Egyptian. Europe tacitly acquiesced. Why did it do so? It\r\nwas because a clause was introduced into the Anglo-Egyptian Convention\r\nof 1899, under which no trade preference was to be accorded to any\r\nnation. All were placed on a footing of perfect equality. Indeed, the\r\nwhole fiscal policy adopted in Egypt since the British occupation in\r\n1883 has been based on distinctly Free Trade principles. Indirect taxes\r\nhave been, in some instances, reduced. Those that remain in force are\r\nimposed, not for protective, but for revenue purposes, whilst in one\r\nimportant instance--that of cotton goods--an excise duty has been\r\nimposed, in order to avoid the risk of customs duties acting\r\nprotectively.\r\n\r\nFree Trade mitigates, though it is powerless to remove, international\r\nanimosities. Exclusive trade stimulates and aggravates those\r\nanimosities. I do not by any means maintain that this argument is by\r\nitself conclusive against the adoption of a policy of Protection, if, on\r\nother grounds, the adoption of such a policy is deemed desirable; but it\r\nis one aspect of the question which, when the whole issue is under\r\nconsideration, should not be left out of account.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Subsequently published in _The Nineteenth Century and\r\nAfter_ for September 1910.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: _Life of Cobden_, Morley, vol. i. p. 231.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: Sir Robert Peel, as is well known, did not fall into this\r\nerror, and even Mr. Cobden appears to have recognised so early as 1849\r\nthat his original forecasts on this point were too optimistic. Speaking\r\non January 10, 1849, he said: \"At the last stage of the Anti-Corn Law\r\nAgitation, our opponents were driven to this position: 'Free Trade is a\r\nvery good thing, but you cannot have it until other countries adopt it\r\ntoo.' And I used to say: 'If Free Trade be a good thing for us, we will\r\nhave it; let others take it if it be a good thing for them; if not, let\r\nthem do without it.'\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: Hirst, _Life of Friedrich List_, p. 134.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: Essay on the Influence of Commerce on International\r\nConflicts; F. Greenwood, _Ency. Brit._ (Tenth Edition).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: In connection with this branch of the question, I wish to\r\ndraw attention to the fact that Professor Shield Nicholson, in his\r\nrecent brilliant work, _A Project of Empire_, has conclusively shown\r\nthat it is a misapprehension to suppose that Adam Smith, in advocating\r\nFree Trade, looked merely to the interests of the consumer, and\r\nneglected altogether those of the producer. Mr. Gladstone's statement on\r\nthis subject, made in 1860, is well known.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: Reports on the Tariff wars between certain European\r\nStates, Parliamentary paper, Commercial, No. 1 (1904), p. 46.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nCHINA\r\n\r\n_\"The Nineteenth Century and After,\" May 1913_\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Bland's book, entitled _Recent Events and Present Policies in China_\r\n(1912), is full of instruction not only for those who are specially\r\nconcerned in the affairs of China, but also for all who are interested\r\nin watching the new developments which are constantly arising from the\r\never-increasing contact between the East and the West.\r\n\r\nThe Eastern world is at present strewn with the _débris_ of paper\r\nconstitutions, which are, or are probably about to become, derelict. The\r\ncase of Egypt is somewhat special, and would require separate treatment.\r\nBut in Turkey, in Persia, and in China, the epidemic, which is of an\r\nexotic character, appears to be following its normal course.\r\n\r\nConstitutions when first promulgated are received with wild enthusiasm.\r\nIn Italy, during the most frenzied period of Garibaldian worship, my\r\nold friend, Lear the artist, asked a patriotic inn-keeper, who was in a\r\nwild state of excitement, to give him breakfast, to which the man\r\nreplied: \"Colazione! Che colazione! Tutto è amore e libertà!\" In the\r\nAlbanian village in which Miss Durham was residing when the Young Turks\r\nproclaimed their constitution, the Moslem inhabitants expressed great\r\ndelight at the news, and forthwith asked when the massacre of the\r\nGiaours--without which a constitution would wholly miss its mark--was to\r\nbegin.[66] Similarly, Mr. Bland says that throughout China, although\r\n\"the word 'Republic' meant no more to the people at large than the\r\nblessed word 'Mesopotamia,' men embraced each other publicly and wept\r\nfor joy at the coming of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity.\"\r\n\r\nThese ebullitions provoke laughter.\r\n\r\n    Sed facilis cuivis rigidi censura cachinni.\r\n\r\nWe Europeans have ourselves passed through much the same phases. Vandal\r\nand others have told us of the Utopia which was created in the minds of\r\nthe French when the old régime crashed to the ground. Sydney Smith\r\ncaricatured the delusive hopes excited by the passing of the Reform Bill\r\nof 1832, when he said that all the unmarried young women thought that\r\nthey would at once get husbands, and that all the schoolboys expected a\r\nheavy fall in the price of jam tarts. A process of disillusionment may\r\nconfidently be anticipated in Ireland if the Home Rule Bill becomes law,\r\nand the fairy prospects held out to the Irish people by Mr. Redmond and\r\nthe other stage managers of the piece are chilled by the cold shade of\r\nreality.\r\n\r\nWe English are largely responsible for creating the frame of mind which\r\nis even now luring Young Turks, Chinamen, and other Easterns into the\r\npolitical wilderness by the display of false signals. We have, indeed,\r\nour Blands in China, our Milners in Egypt, our Miss Durhams in the\r\nBalkan Peninsula, and our Miss Bells in Mesopotamia, who wander far\r\nafield, gleaning valuable facts and laying before their countrymen and\r\ncountrywomen conclusions based on acquired knowledge and wide\r\nexperience. But their efforts are only partially successful. They are\r\noften shivered on the solid rock of preconceived prejudices, and genuine\r\nbut ill-informed sentimentalism. A large section of the English public\r\nare, in fact, singularly wanting in political imagination. Although they\r\nwould not, in so many words, admit the truth of the statement, they none\r\nthe less act and speak as if sound national development in whatsoever\r\nquarter of the world must of necessity proceed along their own\r\nconventional, insular, and time-honoured lines, and along those lines\r\nalone. There is a whole class of newspaper readers, and also of\r\nnewspaper writers, who resemble that eminent but now deceased Member of\r\nParliament, who told me that during the four hours' railway journey from\r\nPort Said to Cairo he had come to the definite conclusion that Egypt\r\ncould not be prosperous because he had observed that there were no\r\nstacks of corn standing in the fields; neither was this conclusion in\r\nany way shaken when it was explained to him that the Egyptians were not\r\nin the habit of erecting corn stacks after the English model. All these\r\nclasses readily lend an ear to quack, though often very well-intentioned\r\npoliticians, who go about the world preaching that countries can be\r\nregenerated by shibboleths, and that the characters of nations can be\r\nchanged by Acts of Parliament. This frame of mind appeals with\r\nirresistible force to the untrained Eastern habit of thought. T'ang--a\r\nleading Chinese Republican--Mr. Bland says, \"like all educated Chinese,\r\nbelieves in the magic virtue of words and forms of government in making\r\na nation wise and strong by Acts of Parliament.\" And what poor,\r\nself-deluded T'ang is saying and thinking in Canton is said and thought\r\ndaily by countless Ahmeds, Ibrahims, and Rizas in the bazaars of\r\nConstantinople, Cairo, and Teheran.\r\n\r\nWhat has Mr. Bland to tell us of all the welter of loan-mongering,\r\nrococo constitution-tinkering, Confucianism, and genuine if at times\r\nmisdirected philanthropy, which is now seething in the Chinese\r\nmelting-pot?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, he has to say that the main obstacle to all real\r\nprogress in China is one that cannot be removed by any change in the\r\nform of government, whether the ruling spirit be a full-fledged\r\nRepublican of the Sun Yat-Sen type, aided by a number of \"imitation\r\nforeigners,\" as they are termed by their countrymen, or a savage, albeit\r\nstatesmanlike \"Old Buddha,\" who, at the close of a life stained by all\r\nmanner of blood-guiltiness, at last turned her weary face towards\r\nWestern reform as the only hope of saving her country and her dynasty.\r\nThe main disease is not political, and is incapable of being cured by\r\nthe most approved constitutional formulae. It is economic. Polygamy,\r\naided by excessive philo-progenitiveness, the result of\r\nancestor-worship, has produced a highly congested population. Vast\r\nmasses of people are living in normal times on the verge of starvation.\r\nHence come famines and savage revolts of the hungry. \"Amidst all the\r\nspecifics of political leaders,\" Mr. Bland says, \"there has been as yet\r\nhardly a voice raised against marriages of minors or polygamy, and\r\nreckless over-breeding, which are the basic causes of China's chronic\r\nunrest.\"\r\n\r\nThe same difficulty, though perhaps in a less acute form, exists in\r\nIndia. Not only cannot it be remedied by mere philanthropy, but it is\r\nabsolutely certain--cruel and paradoxical though it may appear to say\r\nso--that philanthropy enhances the evil. In the days of Akhbar or Shah\r\nJehan, cholera, famine, and internal strife kept down the population.\r\nOnly the fittest survived. Now, internal strife is forbidden, and\r\nphilanthropy steps in and says that no single life shall be sacrificed\r\nif science and Western energy or skill can save it. Hence the growth of\r\na highly congested population, vast numbers of whom are living on a bare\r\nmargin of subsistence. I need hardly say that I am not condemning\r\nphilanthropy. On the contrary, I hold strongly that an\r\nanti-philanthropic basis of government is not merely degrading and\r\ninhuman, but also fortunately nowadays impracticable. None the less, the\r\nfact that one of the greatest difficulties of governing the teeming\r\nmasses in the East is caused by good and humane government should be\r\nrecognised. It is too often ignored.\r\n\r\nA partial remedy to the state of things now existing in China would be\r\nto encourage emigration; but a resort to this expedient is impossible,\r\nfor Europeans and Americans alike, being scared by the prospect of\r\ncompeting with Chinese cheap labour, which is the only real Yellow\r\nPeril,[67] as also by the demoralisation consequent on a large influx of\r\nChinamen into their dominions, close their ports to the emigrants. That\r\nYoung China should feel this as a gross injustice can be no matter for\r\nsurprise. The Chinaman may, with inexorable logic, state his case thus:\r\n\"You, Europeans and Americans, insist on my receiving and protecting\r\nyour missionaries. I do not want them. I have, in Confucianism, a system\r\nof philosophy, which, whatever you may think of it, suits all my\r\nspiritual requirements, and which has been sufficient to hold Chinese\r\nsociety together for long centuries past. Nevertheless, I bow to your\r\nwishes. But then surely you ought in justice to allow free entry into\r\nyour dominions to my carpenters and bricklayers, of whom I have a large\r\nsurplus, of which I should be glad to be rid. Is not your boasted\r\nphilanthropy somewhat vicarious, and does not your public morality\r\nsavour in some degree of mere opportunist cant?\"\r\n\r\nTo all of which, Europeans and Americans can only reply that the\r\ninstinct of self-preservation, which is strong within them, points\r\nclearly to the absolute necessity of excluding the Chinese carpenters\r\nand bricklayers; and, further, as regards the missionaries, that there\r\ncan be but one answer, and that in a Christian sense, to the question\r\nasked by jesting Pilate. In effect they say that circumstances alter\r\ncases, and that might is right--a plea which may perhaps suffice to\r\nsalve the conscience of an opportunist politician, but ought to appeal\r\nless forcibly to a stern moralist.\r\n\r\nForeign emigration, even if it were possible, would, however, be a mere\r\npalliative. A more thorough and effective remedy would be to facilitate\r\nthe dispersion of the population in the congested districts over those\r\nwide tracts of China itself which are suffering in a less degree from\r\ncongestion. I conceive that the execution of a policy of this nature\r\nwould not be altogether impossible. It could be carried into effect by\r\nimproving the means of locomotion, possibly by the construction of\r\nirrigation works on a large scale, and by developing the resources of\r\nthe country, which are admittedly very great. But there is one condition\r\nwhich is essential to the execution of this programme, and that is that\r\nthe financial administration of the country should be sufficiently\r\nhonest to inspire the confidence of those European investors who alone\r\ncan provide the necessary capital. Now, according to Mr. Bland, this\r\nfundamental quality of honesty is not to be found throughout the length\r\nand breadth of China, whether in the ranks of the old Mandarins or in\r\nthose of the young Republicans.\r\n\r\n     The essential virtue of personal integrity [he says], the capacity\r\n     to handle public funds with common honesty, has been conspicuously\r\n     lacking in Young China. The leopard has not changed his spots; the\r\n     sons and brothers of the classical Mandarin remain, in spite of\r\n     Western learning, Mandarins by instinct and in practice.\r\n\r\nA very close observer of Eastern affairs--Mr. Stanley Lane-Poole--has\r\nsaid that the East has an extraordinary facility for assimilating all\r\nthe worst features of any new civilisation with which it is brought in\r\ncontact. This is what has happened in India, in Turkey, in Egypt, and in\r\nPersia. Even in Japan it has yet to be seen whether the old national\r\nvirtues will survive prolonged contact with the West. Hear now what Mr.\r\nBland has to say of China:\r\n\r\n     Where Young China has cast off the ethical restraints and patriotic\r\n     morality of Confucianism, it has failed to assimilate, or even to\r\n     understand, the moral foundations of Europe's civilisation. It has\r\n     exchanged its old lamp for a new, but it has not found the oil,\r\n     which the new vessel needs, to lighten the darkness withal.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of so highly qualified an authority as Prince Ito, \"the\r\nsentiments of foreign educated Young China are hopelessly out of touch\r\nwith the masses.\" But while there has been alienation from the ideals of\r\nthe East, there has been no real approach to the ideals of the West.\r\n\r\n     Education at Harvard or Oxford may imbue the Chinese student with\r\n     ideas and social tendencies, apparently antagonistic to those of\r\n     the patriarchal system of his native land; but they do not, and\r\n     cannot, create in him (as some would have us believe) the\r\n     Anglo-Saxon outlook on life, the standards of conduct and the\r\n     beliefs which are the results of centuries of our process of\r\n     civilisation and structural character. Under his top dressing of\r\n     Western learning, the Chinese remains true to type, instinctively\r\n     detached from the practical and scientific attitude,\r\n     contemplatively philosophical, with the fatalistic philosophy of\r\n     the prophet Job, concerned rather with the causes than the results\r\n     of things. Your barrister at Lincoln's Inn, after ten years of\r\n     cosmopolitan experience in London or Washington, will revert in six\r\n     months to the ancestral type of morals and manners; the spectacle\r\n     is so common, even in the case of exceptionally assimilative men\r\n     like Wu Ting-fang, or the late Marquis Tseng, that it evokes little\r\n     or no comment amongst Europeans in China.\r\n\r\nNotably from the point of view of financial honesty, which, as I have\r\nalready mentioned, is of cardinal importance if the regeneration of the\r\ncountry is to be undertaken by other means than by mock constitutions,\r\nthe results of Western education are most disappointing.\r\n\r\n     The opinion [Mr. Bland says] is widely held amongst European\r\n     residents and traders that the section of Young China which has\r\n     received its education in Foreign Mission schools displays no more\r\n     honesty than the rest.\r\n\r\nWhat is the conclusion to be drawn from these facts? It is that not only\r\nin order to obtain adequate security for the bond-holders--in whom I am\r\nnot in any way personally interested, for I shall certainly not be one\r\nof them--but also in the interests of the Chinese people, it is\r\nessential, before any loan is contracted, to insist on a strict\r\nsupervision of the expenditure of the loan funds. That Young China,\r\npartly on genuine patriotic grounds and also possibly in some cases on\r\ngrounds which are less worthy of respect and sympathy, should resent the\r\nexercise of this supervision, is natural enough, but it can scarcely be\r\ndoubted that unless it be exercised a large portion of the money\r\nadvanced by European capitalists will be wasted, and that no really\r\neffective step forward will be taken in the solution of the economic\r\nproblem which constitutes the main Chinese difficulty. The very\r\nrudimentary ideas entertained by the Chinese themselves in the matter of\r\napplying funds to productive works is sufficiently illustrated by the\r\nepisode mentioned by Mr. Bland, where he tells us that \"the Szechuan\r\nRailway Company directors made provision for the building of their line\r\nby the appointment of station-masters\"; while the fact that but a short\r\ntime ago 1400 German machine guns, costing £500 apiece, which had never\r\nbeen used or paid for, were lying at Shanghai, indicates the manner in\r\nwhich it is not only possible but highly probable that the loan funds\r\nunder exclusively Chinese supervision would be frittered away on\r\nunproductive objects.\r\n\r\nThose, indeed, who have had some practical experience of financial\r\nadministration in Eastern countries may well entertain some doubts as to\r\nwhether supervision which only embraces the expenditure, and does not\r\napply to the revenue, will be sufficient to meet all the requirements of\r\nthe case. The results so far attained by the more limited scheme of\r\nsupervision do not appear to have been satisfactory. Herr Rump was\r\nappointed auditor to the German section of the Tientsin-P'ukou Railway,\r\nbut Mr. Bland tells us that \"the auditorship on this railway has proved\r\nworse than useless as a preventive of official peculation.\" On the other\r\nhand, the system of collecting the revenue is in the highest degree\r\ndefective. It violates flagrantly a principle which, from the days of\r\nAdam Smith downwards, has always been regarded as the corner-stone of\r\nany sound financial administration. \"For every tael officially accounted\r\nfor by the provincial authorities,\" Mr. Bland says, in words which\r\nrecall to my mind the Egyptian fiscal system under the régime of Ismail\r\nPasha, \"at least five are actually collected from the taxpayers.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, earnestly to be hoped that the diplomatists and\r\ncapitalists of Europe will--both in the interests of the investing\r\npublic and in those of the Chinese people--stand firm and insist on\r\nadequate financial control as a preliminary and essential condition to\r\nthe advance of funds.\r\n\r\nAs to whether the recently established Republic is destined to last or\r\nwhether it will prove a mere ephemeral episode in the life-history of\r\nChina, there seems to be much divergence of opinion among those\r\nauthorities who are most qualified to speak on the subject. Mr. Bland's\r\nviews on this point are, however, quite clear. He thinks that\r\nConfucianism, and all the political and social habits of thought which\r\nare the outcome of Confucianism, have \"become ingrained in every fibre\r\nof the national life,\" and that they constitute the \"fundamental cause\r\nof the longevity of China's social structure and of the innate strength\r\nof her civilisation.\" He refuses to believe that Young China, which is\r\nimbued with \"a doctrinaire spirit of political speculation,\" though it\r\nmay tinker with the superstructure, will be able seriously to shake the\r\nfoundations of this hoary edifice. He has watched the opinions and\r\nactivities in every province from the beginning of the present\r\nrevolution, and he \"is compelled to the conviction that salvation from\r\nthis quarter is impossible.\" He thinks that although in Canton and the\r\nKuang Provinces, which are the most intellectually advanced portions of\r\nChina, a system of popular representation may be introduced with some\r\nhope of beneficial results,\r\n\r\n     ... as regards the rest of China, as every educated Chinese knows\r\n     (unless, like Sun Yat-Sen, he has been brought up abroad), the idea\r\n     of rapidly transforming the masses of the population into an\r\n     intelligent electorate, and of making a Chinese Parliament the\r\n     expression of their collective political vitality, is a vain dream,\r\n     possible only for those who ignore the inherent character of the\r\n     Chinese people.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one consideration set forth by Mr. Bland, which may\r\npossibly prove, at all events for a time, the salvation, while it\r\nassuredly connotes the condemnation of the present system of government,\r\nand that is that the Chinese Republic may continue to exist by\r\nabrogating all republican principles. According to Mr. Bland this \"gran\r\nrifiuto\" has already been made. \"The actual government of China,\" he\r\nsays, \"contains none of the elements of genuine Republicanism, but is\r\nmerely the old despotism, the old Mandarinate, under new names.\" \"The\r\ninauguration of the Republican idea of constitutional Government in\r\nChina,\" he says in another passage, \"can only mean, in the present state\r\nof the people, continual transference of an illegal despotism from one\r\ngroup of political adventurers to another, the pretence of popular\r\nrepresentation serving merely to increase and perpetuate instability.\"\r\n\r\nIt would require a far greater knowledge of Chinese affairs than any to\r\nwhich I can pretend to express either unqualified adherence to or\r\ndissent from Mr. Bland's views. But it is clear that his diagnosis of\r\nthe past is based on a very thorough acquaintance with the facts, while,\r\non _a priori_ grounds, his prognosis of the future is calculated to\r\ncommend itself to those of general experience who have studied Oriental\r\ncharacter and are acquainted with Oriental history.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: _High Albania_, p. 311.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: See on this subject the final remarks in Mr. Bland's very\r\ninstructive chapter xiv.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE CAPITULATIONS IN EGYPT\r\n\r\n_\"The Nineteenth Century and After,\" July 1913_\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the six years which have elapsed since I left Cairo I have, for\r\nvarious reasons on which it is unnecessary to dwell, carefully abstained\r\nfrom taking any part in whatever discussions have arisen on current\r\nEgyptian affairs. If I now depart from the reticence which I have\r\nhitherto observed it is because there appears at all events some slight\r\nprospect that the main reform which is required to render the government\r\nand administration of Egypt efficient will be seriously considered. As\r\nso frequently happens in political affairs, a casual incident has\r\ndirected public attention to the need of reform. A short time ago a\r\nRussian subject was, at the request of the Consular authorities,\r\narrested by the Egyptian police and handed over to them for deportation\r\nto Russia. I am not familiar with the details of the case, neither, for\r\nthe purposes of my present argument, is any knowledge of those details\r\nrequired. The nature of the offence of which this man, Adamovitch by\r\nname, was accused, as also the question of whether he was guilty or\r\ninnocent of that offence, are altogether beside the point. The legal\r\nobligation of the Egyptian Government to comply with the request that\r\nthe man should be handed over to the Russian Consular authorities would\r\nhave been precisely the same if he had been accused of no offence at\r\nall. The result, however, has been to touch one of the most tender\r\npoints in the English political conscience. It has become clear that a\r\ncountry which is not, indeed, British territory, but which is held by a\r\nBritish garrison, and in which British influence is predominant, affords\r\nno safe asylum for a political refugee. Without in any way wishing to\r\nunderrate the importance of this consideration, I think it necessary to\r\npoint out that this is only one out of the many anomalies which might be\r\nindicated in the working of that most perplexing political creation\r\nentitled the Egyptian Government and administration. Many instances\r\nmight, in fact, be cited which, albeit they are less calculated to\r\nattract public attention in this country, afford even stronger ground\r\nfor holding that the time has come for reforming the system hitherto\r\nknown as that of the Capitulations.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to deal with this question I may perhaps be pardoned\r\nif, at the risk of appearing egotistical, I indulge in a very short\r\nchapter of autobiography. My own action in Egypt has formed the subject\r\nof frequent comment in this country; neither, assuredly, in spite of\r\noccasional blame, have I any reason to complain of the measure of\r\npraise--often, I fear, somewhat unmerited praise--which has been\r\naccorded to me. But I may perhaps be allowed to say what, in my own\r\nopinion, are the main objects achieved during my twenty-four-years'\r\ntenure of office. Those achievements are four in number, and let me add\r\nthat they were not the results of a hand-to-mouth conduct of affairs in\r\nwhich the direction afforded to political events was constantly shifted,\r\nbut of a deliberate plan persistently pursued with only such temporary\r\ndeviations and delays as the circumstances of the time rendered\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the tension with the French Government, which lasted\r\nfor twenty-one years and which might at any moment have become very\r\nserious, was never allowed to go beyond a certain point. In spite of a\r\ngood deal of provocation, a policy of conciliation was persistently\r\nadopted, with the result that the conclusion of the Anglo-French\r\nAgreement of 1904 became eventually possible. It is on this particular\r\nfeature of my Egyptian career that personally I look back with far\r\ngreater pride and pleasure than any other, all the more so because,\r\nalthough it has, comparatively speaking, attracted little public\r\nattention, it was, in reality, by far the most difficult and responsible\r\npart of my task.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, bankruptcy was averted and the finances of the\r\ncountry placed on a sound footing.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, by the relief of taxation and other reforms which\r\nremedied any really substantial grievances, the ground was cut away from\r\nunder the feet of the demagogues whom it was easy to foresee would\r\nspring into existence as education advanced.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth place, the Soudan, which had to be abandoned in 1884-85,\r\nwas eventually recovered.\r\n\r\nThese, I say, are the things which were done. Let me now state what was\r\nnot done. Although, of course, the number of Egyptians employed in the\r\nservice of the Government was largely increased, and although the\r\ncharges which have occasionally been made that education was unduly\r\nneglected admit of easy refutation, it is none the less true that\r\nlittle, if any, progress was made in the direction of conferring\r\nautonomy on Egypt. The reasons why so little progress was made in this\r\ndirection were twofold.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it would have been premature even to think of the\r\nquestion until the long struggle against bankruptcy had been fought and\r\nwon, and also until, by the conclusion of the Anglo-French Agreement in\r\n1904, the acute international tension which heretofore existed had been\r\nrelaxed.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the idea of what constituted autonomy entertained\r\nby those Egyptians who were most in a position to make their voices\r\nheard, as also by some of their English sympathisers, differed widely\r\nfrom that entertained by myself and others who were well acquainted with\r\nthe circumstances of the country, and on whom the responsibility of\r\ndevising and executing any plan for granting autonomy would naturally\r\ndevolve. We were, in fact, the poles asunder. The Egyptian idea was that\r\nthe native Egyptians should rule Egypt. They therefore urged that\r\ngreatly increased powers should be given to the Legislative Council and\r\nAssembly originally instituted by Lord Dufferin. The counter-idea was\r\nnot based on any alleged incapacity of the Egyptians to govern\r\nthemselves--a point which, for the purposes of my present argument, it\r\nis unnecessary to discuss. Neither was it based on any disinclination\r\ngradually to extend the powers of Egyptians in dealing with purely\r\nnative Egyptian questions.[68] I, and others who shared my views,\r\nconsidered that those who cried \"Egypt for the Egyptians\" on the\r\nhouse-tops had gone off on an entirely wrong scent because, even had\r\nthey attained their ends, nothing approaching to Egyptian autonomy would\r\nhave been realised. The Capitulations would still have barred the way to\r\nall important legislation and to the removal of those defects in the\r\nadministration of which the Egyptians most complained. When the\r\nprominent part played by resident Europeans in the political and social\r\nlife of Egypt is considered, it is indeed little short of ridiculous to\r\nspeak of Egyptian autonomy if at the same time a system is preserved\r\nunder which no important law can be made applicable to an Englishman, a\r\nFrenchman, or a German, without its detailed provisions having received\r\nthe consent, not only of the King of England, the President of the\r\nFrench Republic, and the German Emperor, but also that of the President\r\nof the United States, the King of Denmark, and every other ruling\r\nPotentate in Europe. We therefore held that the only possible method by\r\nwhich the evils of extreme personal government could be averted, and by\r\nwhich the country could be provided with a workable legislative machine,\r\nwas to include in the term \"Egyptians\" all the dwellers in Egypt, and to\r\ndevise some plan by which the European and Egyptian elements of society\r\nwould be fused together to such an extent at all events as to render\r\nthem capable of cooperating in legislative effort. It may perhaps be\r\nhoped that by taking a first step in this direction some more thorough\r\nfusion may possibly follow in the future.\r\n\r\nAs I have already mentioned, it would have been premature to deal with\r\nthis question prior to 1904, for any serious modification of the régime\r\nof the Capitulations could not be considered as within the domain of\r\npractical politics so long as all the Powers, and more especially France\r\nand England, were pulling different ways. But directly that agreement\r\nwas signed I resolved to take the question up, all the more so because\r\nwhat was then known as the Secret Agreement, but which has since that\r\ntime been published, contained the following very important clause:\r\n\r\n     In the event of their (His Britannic Majesty's Government)\r\n     considering it desirable to introduce in Egypt reforms tending to\r\n     assimilate the Egyptian legislative system to that in force in\r\n     other civilised countries, the Government of the French Republic\r\n     will not refuse to entertain any such proposals, on the\r\n     understanding that His Britannic Majesty's Government will agree to\r\n     entertain the suggestions that the Government of the French\r\n     Republic may have to make to them with a view of introducing\r\n     similar reforms in Morocco.\r\n\r\nI was under no delusion as to the formidable nature of the obstacles\r\nwhich stood in the way of reform. Moreover, I held very strongly that\r\neven if it had been possible, by diplomatic negotiations with the other\r\nPowers, to come to some arrangement which would be binding on the\r\nEuropeans resident in Egypt, and to force it on them without their\r\nconsent being obtained, it was most undesirable to adopt anything\r\napproaching to this procedure. The European colonists in Egypt, although\r\nof course numerically far inferior to the native population, represent a\r\nlarge portion of the wealth, and a still larger portion of the\r\nintelligence and energy in the country. Moreover, although the word\r\n\"privilege\" always rather grates on the ear in this democratic age, it\r\nis none the less true that in the past the misgovernment of Egypt has\r\nafforded excellent reasons why even those Europeans who are most\r\nfavourably disposed towards native aspirations should demur to any\r\nsacrifice of their capitulary rights. My view, therefore, was that the\r\nEuropeans should not be coerced but persuaded. It had to be proved to\r\nthem that, under the changed condition of affairs, the Capitulations\r\nwere not only unnecessary but absolutely detrimental to their own\r\ninterests. Personally, I was very fully convinced of the truth of this\r\nstatement, neither was it difficult to convince those who, being behind\r\nthe scenes of government, were in a position to judge of the extent to\r\nwhich the Capitulations clogged progress in many very important\r\ndirections. But it was more difficult to convince the general public,\r\nmany of whom entertained very erroneous ideas as to the extent and\r\nnature of the proposed reforms, and could see nothing but the fact that\r\nit was intended to deprive them of certain privileges which they then\r\npossessed. It cannot be too distinctly understood that there never\r\nwas--neither do I suppose there is now--the smallest intention of\r\n\"abolishing the Capitulations,\" if by that term is meant a complete\r\nabrogation of all those safeguards against arbitrary proceedings on the\r\npart of the Government which the Capitulations are intended to prevent.\r\nCapitulations or no Capitulations, the European charged with a criminal\r\noffence must be tried either by European judges or an European jury. All\r\nmatters connected with the personal status of any European must be\r\njudged by the laws in force in his own country. Adequate safeguards\r\nmust be contrived to guard against any abuse of power on the part of the\r\npolice. Whatever reforms are introduced into the Mixed Tribunals must be\r\nconfined to comparatively minor points, and must not touch fundamental\r\nprinciples. In fact, the Capitulations have not to be abolished, but to\r\nbe modified. An eminent French jurist, M. Gabriel Louis Jaray, in\r\ndiscussing the Egyptian situation a few years ago, wrote:\r\n\r\n     On peut considérer comme admis qu'une simple occupation ou un\r\n     protectorat de fait, reconnu par les Puissances Européennes, suffit\r\n     pour mettre à néant les Capitulations, quand la réorganisation du\r\n     pays est suffisante pour donner aux Européens pleine garantie de\r\n     bonne juridiction.\r\n\r\nI contend that the reorganisation of Egypt is now sufficiently advanced\r\nto admit of the guarantees for the good administration of justice, which\r\nM. Jaray very rightly claimed, being afforded to all Europeans without\r\nhaving recourse to the clumsy methods of the Capitulations in their\r\npresent form.\r\n\r\nIn the last two reports which I wrote before I left Egypt I developed\r\nthese and some cognate arguments at considerable length. But from the\r\nfirst moment of taking up the question I never thought that it would\r\nfall to my lot to bring the campaign against the Capitulations to a\r\nconclusion. The question was eminently one as to which it was\r\nundesirable to force the pace. Time was required in order to let public\r\nopinion mature. I therefore contented myself with indicating the defects\r\nof the present system and the general direction which reform should\r\ntake, leaving it to those younger than myself to carry on the work when\r\nadvancing years obliged me to retire. I may add that the manner in which\r\nmy proposals were received and discussed by the European public in Egypt\r\nafforded good reason for supposing that the obstacles to be overcome\r\nbefore any serious reforms could be effected, though formidable, were by\r\nno means insuperable. After my departure in 1907, events occurred which\r\nrendered it impossible that the subject should at once come under the\r\nconsideration of the Government, but in 1911 Lord Kitchener was able to\r\nreport that the legislative powers of the Court of Appeal sitting at\r\nAlexandria had been somewhat increased. Sir Malcolm M'Ilwraith, the\r\nJudicial Adviser of the Egyptian Government, in commenting on this\r\nchange, says:\r\n\r\n     The new scheme, while assuredly a progressive step, and in notable\r\n     advance of the previous state of affairs ... can hardly be\r\n     regarded, in its ensemble, as more than a temporary makeshift, and\r\n     a more or less satisfactory palliative of the legislative impotence\r\n     under which the Government has suffered for so long.\r\n\r\nIt is most earnestly to be hoped that the question will now be taken up\r\nseriously with a view to more drastic reform than any which has as yet\r\nbeen effected.\r\n\r\nThere is one, and only one, method by which the evils of the existing\r\nsystem can be made to disappear. The British Government should request\r\nthe other Powers of Europe to vest in them the legislative power which\r\neach now exercises separately. Simultaneously with this request, a\r\nlegislative Chamber should be created in Egypt for enacting laws to\r\nwhich Europeans will be amenable.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, one essential preliminary to the execution of this\r\nprogramme. It is that the Powers of Europe, as also the European\r\nresidents in Egypt, should have thorough confidence in the intentions of\r\nthe British Government, by which I mean confidence in the duration of\r\nthe occupation, and also confidence in the manner in which the affairs\r\nof the country will be administered.\r\n\r\nAs regards the first point, there is certainly no cause for doubt. Under\r\nthe Anglo-French Agreement of 1904 the French Government specifically\r\ndeclared that \"they will not obstruct the action of government in Egypt\r\nby asking that a limit of time be fixed for the British occupation, or\r\nin any other manner.\" Moreover, one of the last acts that I performed\r\nbefore I left Egypt in 1907 was to communicate to the British Chamber of\r\nCommerce at Alexandria a letter from Sir Edward Grey in which I was\r\nauthorised to state that His Majesty's Government \"recognise that the\r\nmaintenance and development of such reforms as have hitherto been\r\neffected in Egypt depend upon the British occupation. This consideration\r\nwill apply with equal strength to any changes effected in the régime of\r\nthe Capitulations. His Majesty's Government, therefore, wish it to be\r\nunderstood that there is no reason for allowing the prospect of any\r\nmodifications in that régime to be prejudiced by the existence of any\r\ndoubt as to the continuance of the British occupation of the country.\"\r\nIt is, of course, conceivable that in some remote future the British\r\ngarrison may be withdrawn from Egypt. If any fear is entertained on this\r\nground it may easily be calmed by an arrangement with the Powers that in\r\nthe event of the British Government wishing to withdraw their troops,\r\nthey would previously enter into communications with the various Powers\r\nof Europe with a view to re-establishing whatever safeguards they might\r\nthink necessary in the interests of their countrymen.\r\n\r\nAs regards the second point, that is to say, confidence in the manner in\r\nwhich the administration of the country is conducted, I need only say\r\nthat, so far as I am able to judge, Lord Kitchener's administration,\r\nalthough one of his measures--the Five Feddan law--has, not unnaturally,\r\nbeen subjected to a good deal of hostile criticism, has inspired the\r\nfullest confidence in the minds of the whole of the population of Egypt,\r\nwhether European or native. I cannot doubt that, when the time arrives\r\nfor Lord Kitchener, in his turn, to retire, no brusque or radical change\r\nwill be allowed to take place in the general principles under which he\r\nis now administering the country.\r\n\r\nThe rights and duties of any such Chamber as that which I propose, its\r\ncomposition, its mode of election or nomination, the degree of control\r\nto be exercised over it by the Egyptian or British Governments, are, of\r\ncourse, all points which require very careful consideration, and which\r\nadmit of solution in a great variety of ways. In my report for the year\r\n1906 I put forward certain suggestions in connection with each of these\r\nsubjects, but I do not doubt that, as the result of further\r\nconsideration and discussion, my proposals admit of improvement. I need\r\nnot now dwell on these details, important though they be. I wish,\r\nhowever, to allude to one point which involves a question of principle.\r\nI trust that no endeavour will for the present be made to create one\r\nChamber, composed of both Europeans and Egyptians, with power to\r\nlegislate for all the inhabitants of Egypt. I am strongly convinced\r\nthat, under the present condition of society in Egypt, any such attempt\r\nmust end in complete failure. It is, I believe, quite impossible to\r\ndevise any plan for an united Chamber which would satisfy the very\r\nnatural aspirations of the Egyptians, and at the same time provide for\r\nthe Europeans adequate guarantees that their own legitimate rights would\r\nbe properly safeguarded. I am fully aware of the theoretical objections\r\nwhich may be urged against trying the novel experiment of creating two\r\nChambers in the same country, each of which would deal with separate\r\nclasses of the community, but I submit that, in the special\r\ncircumstances of the case, those objections must be set aside, and that\r\none more anomaly should, for the time being at all events, be added to\r\nthe many strange institutions which exist in the \"Land of Paradox.\"\r\nWhether at some probably remote future period it will be possible to\r\ncreate a Chamber in which Europeans and Egyptians will sit side by side\r\nwill depend very largely on the conduct of the Egyptians themselves. If\r\nthey follow the advice of those who do not flatter them, but who,\r\nhowever little they may recognise the fact, are in reality their best\r\nfriends--if, in a word, they act in such a manner as to inspire the\r\nEuropean residents of Egypt with confidence in their judgment and\r\nabsence of class or religious prejudice, it may be that this\r\nconsummation will eventually be reached. If, on the other hand, they\r\nallow themselves to be guided by the class of men who have of late years\r\noccasionally posed as their representatives, the prospect of any\r\ncomplete legislative amalgamation will become not merely gloomy but\r\npractically hopeless. The true Egyptian patriot is not the man who by\r\nhis conduct and language stimulates racial animosity in the pursuit of\r\nan ideal which can never be realised, but rather one who recognises the\r\ntrue facts of the political situation. Now, the dominating fact of that\r\nsituation is that Egypt can never become autonomous in the sense in\r\nwhich that word is understood by the Egyptian nationalists. It is, and\r\nwill always remain, a cosmopolitan country. The real future of Egypt,\r\ntherefore, lies not in the direction of a narrow nationalism, which will\r\nonly embrace native Egyptians, nor in that of any endeavour to convert\r\nEgypt into a British possession on the model of India or Ceylon, but\r\nrather in that of an enlarged cosmopolitanism, which, whilst discarding\r\nall the obstructive fetters of the cumbersome old international system,\r\nwill tend to amalgamate all the inhabitants of the Nile Valley and\r\nenable them all alike to share in the government of their native or\r\nadopted country.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, the various points of detail to which I have alluded above\r\npresent difficulties which are by no means insuperable, if--as I trust\r\nmay be the case--the various parties concerned approach the subject with\r\na real desire to arrive at some practical solutions. The same may be\r\nsaid as regards almost all the points to which Europeans resident in\r\nEgypt attach special importance, such, for instance, as the composition\r\nof criminal courts for trying Europeans, the regulation of domiciliary\r\nvisits by the police, and cognate issues. In all these cases it is by no\r\nmeans difficult to devise methods for preserving all that is really\r\nworth keeping in the present system, and at the same time discarding\r\nthose portions which seriously hinder the progress of the country. There\r\nis, however, one important point of detail which, I must admit, presents\r\nconsiderable practical difficulties. It is certain that the services of\r\nsome of the European judges of the Mixed Tribunals might be utilised in\r\nconstituting the new Chamber. Their presence would be of great use, and\r\nit is highly probable that they will in practice become the real working\r\nmen of any Chamber which may be created. But apart from the objection in\r\nprinciple to confiding the making as also the administration of the law\r\nwholly to the same individuals, it is to be observed that, in order to\r\ncreate a really representative body, it would be essential that other\r\nEuropeans--merchants, bankers, landowners, and professional men--should\r\nbe seated in the Chamber. Almost all the Europeans resident in Europe\r\nare busy men, and the question will arise whether those whose assistance\r\nwould, on general grounds, be of special value, are prepared to\r\nsacrifice the time required for paying adequate attention to their\r\nlegislative duties. I can only say that I hope that sufficient public\r\nspirit is to be found amongst the many highly qualified European\r\nresidents in Egypt of divers nationalities to enable this question to be\r\nanswered in the affirmative.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, impossible within the space allotted to me to deal\r\nfully on the present occasion with all the aspects of this very\r\ndifficult and complicated question. I can only attempt to direct\r\nattention to the main issue, and that issue, I repeat, is how to devise\r\nsome plan which shall take the place of the present Egyptian system of\r\nlegislation by diplomacy. The late Lord Salisbury once epigrammatically\r\ndescribed that system to me by saying that it was like the _liberum\r\nveto_ of the old Polish Diet, \"without being able to have recourse to\r\nthe alternative of striking off the head of any recalcitrant voter.\" It\r\nis high time that such a system should be swept away and some other\r\nadopted which will be more in harmony with the actual facts of the\r\nEgyptian situation. If, as I trust may be the case, Lord Kitchener is\r\nable to devise and to carry into execution some plan which will rescue\r\nEgypt from its present legislative Slough of Despond, he will have\r\ndeserved well, not only of his country, but also of all those Egyptian\r\ninterests, whether native or European, which are committed to his\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: It is believed that a proposal to reform the constitution\r\nof the Egyptian Legislative Council and to extend somewhat its powers is\r\nnow under consideration. Any reasonable proposals of this nature should\r\nbe welcomed, but they will do little or nothing towards granting\r\nautonomy to Egypt in the sense in which I understand that word.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE SPECTATOR\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nDISRAELI\r\n\r\n_\"The Spectator,\" November 1912_\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one who has lived much in the East can, in reading Mr. Monypenny's\r\nvolumes, fail to be struck with the fact that Disraeli was a thorough\r\nOriental. The taste for tawdry finery, the habit of enveloping in\r\nmystery matters as to which there was nothing to conceal, the love of\r\nintrigue, the tenacity of purpose--though this is perhaps more a Jewish\r\nthan an invariably Oriental characteristic--the luxuriance of the\r\nimaginative faculties, the strong addiction to plausible generalities\r\nset forth in florid language, the passionate outbursts of grief\r\nexpressed at times in words so artificial as to leave a doubt in the\r\nAnglo-Saxon mind as to whether the sentiments can be genuine, the\r\nspasmodic eruption of real kindness of heart into a character steeped in\r\ncynicism, the excess of flattery accorded at one time to Peel for purely\r\npersonal objects contrasted with the excess of vituperation poured\r\nforth on O'Connell for purposes of advertisement, and the total absence\r\nof any moral principle as a guide of life--all these features, in a\r\ncharacter which is perhaps not quite so complex as is often supposed,\r\nhail from the East. What is not Eastern is his unconventionality, his\r\nundaunted moral courage, and his ready conception of novel political\r\nideas--often specious ideas, resting on no very solid foundation, but\r\nalways attractive, and always capable of being defended by glittering\r\nplausibilities. He was certainly a man of genius, and he used that\r\ngenius to found a political school based on extreme self-seeking\r\nopportunism. In this respect he cannot be acquitted of the charge of\r\nhaving contributed towards the degradation of English political life.\r\n\r\nMr. Monypenny's first volume deals with Disraeli's immature youth. In\r\nthe second, the story of the period (1837-46) during which Disraeli rose\r\nto power is admirably told, and a most interesting story it is.\r\n\r\nWhatever views one may adopt of Disraeli's character and career, it is\r\nimpossible not to be fascinated in watching the moral and intellectual\r\ndevelopment of this very remarkable man, whose conduct throughout life,\r\nfar from being wayward and erratic, as has at times been somewhat\r\nsuperficially supposed, was in reality in the highest degree\r\nmethodical, being directed with unflagging persistency to one end, the\r\ngratification of his own ambition--an ambition, it should always be\r\nremembered, which, albeit it was honourable, inasmuch as it was directed\r\nto no ignoble ends, was wholly personal. If ever there was a man to whom\r\nMilton's well-known lines could fitly be applied it was Disraeli. He\r\nscorned delights. He lived laborious days. In his youth he eschewed\r\npleasures which generally attract others whose ambition only soars to a\r\nlower plane. In the most intimate relations of life he subordinated all\r\nprivate inclinations to the main object he had in view. He avowedly\r\nmarried, in the first instance, for money, although at a later stage his\r\nwife was able to afford herself the consolation, and to pay him the\r\ngraceful compliment of obliterating the sordid reproach by declaring\r\nthat \"if he had the chance again he would marry her for love\"--a\r\nstatement confirmed by his passionate, albeit somewhat histrionic\r\nlove-letters. The desire of fame, which may easily degenerate into a\r\nmere craving for notoriety, was unquestionably the spur which in his\r\ncase raised his \"clear spirit.\" So early as 1833, on being asked upon\r\nwhat principles he was going to stand at a forthcoming election, he\r\nreplied, \"On my head.\" He cared, in fact, little for principles of any\r\nkind, provided the goal of his ambition could be reached. Throughout his\r\ncareer his main object was to rule his countrymen, and that object he\r\nattained by the adoption of methods which, whether they be regarded as\r\ntortuous or straightforward, morally justifiable or worthy of\r\ncondemnation, were of a surety eminently successful.\r\n\r\nThe interest in Mr. Monypenny's work is enormously enhanced by the\r\npersonality of his hero. In dealing with the careers of other English\r\nstatesmen--for instance, with Cromwell, Chatham, or Gladstone--we do,\r\nindeed, glance--and more than glance--at the personality of the man, but\r\nour mature judgment is, or at all events should be, formed mainly on his\r\nmeasures. We inquire what was their ultimate result, and what effect\r\nthey produced? We ask ourselves what degree of foresight the statesman\r\ndisplayed. Did he rightly gauge the true nature of the political,\r\neconomic, or social forces with which he had to deal, or did he mistake\r\nthe signs of the times and allow himself to be lured away by some\r\nephemeral will-o'-the-wisp in the pursuit of objects of secondary or\r\neven fallacious importance? It is necessary to ask these questions in\r\ndealing with the career of Disraeli, but this mental process is, in his\r\ncase, obscured to a very high degree by the absorbing personality of the\r\nman. The individual fills the whole canvas almost to the extent of\r\nexcluding all other objects from view.\r\n\r\nNo tale of fiction is, indeed, more strange than that which tells how\r\nthis nimble-witted alien adventurer, with his poetic temperament, his\r\nweird Eastern imagination and excessive Western cynicism, his elastic\r\nmind which he himself described as \"revolutionary,\" and his apparently\r\nwayward but in reality carefully regulated unconventionality, succeeded,\r\nin spite of every initial disadvantage of race, birth, manners, and\r\nhabits of thought, in dominating a proud aristocracy and using its\r\nmembers as so many pawns on the chess-board which he had arranged to\r\nsuit his own purposes. Thrust into a society which was steeped in\r\nconventionality, he enforced attention to his will by a studied neglect\r\nof everything that was conventional. Dealing with a class who honoured\r\ntradition, he startled the members of that class by shattering all the\r\ntraditions which they had been taught to revere, and by endeavouring,\r\nwith the help of specious arguments which many of them only half\r\nunderstood, to substitute others of an entirely novel character in their\r\nplace. Following much on the lines of those religious reformers who have\r\nat times sought to revive the early discipline and practices of the\r\nChurch, he endeavoured to destroy the Toryism of his day by invoking\r\nthe shade of a semi-mythical Toryism of the past. Bolingbroke was the\r\nmodel to be followed, Shelburne was the tutelary genius of Pitt, and\r\nCharles I. was made to pose as \"a virtuous and able monarch,\" who was\r\n\"the holocaust of direct taxation.\" Never, he declared, \"did man lay\r\ndown his heroic life for so great a cause, the cause of the Church and\r\nthe cause of the Poor.\"[69] Aspiring to rise to power through the agency\r\nof Conservatives, whose narrow-minded conventional conservatism he\r\ndespised, and to whose defects he was keenly alive, he wisely judged\r\nthat it was a necessity, if his programme were to be executed, that the\r\nassociation of political power with landed possessions should be the\r\nsheet-anchor of his system; and, strong in the support afforded by that\r\nmaterial bond of sympathy, he did not hesitate to ridicule the foibles\r\nof those \"patricians\"--to use his own somewhat stilted expression--who,\r\nwhilst they sneered at his apparent eccentricities, despised their own\r\nchosen mouthpiece, and occasionally writhed under his yoke, were none\r\nthe less so fascinated by the powerful will and keen intellect which\r\nheld them captive that they blindly followed his lead, even to the\r\nverge of being duped.\r\n\r\nFrom earliest youth to green old age his confidence in his own powers\r\nwas never shaken. He persistently acted up to the sentiment--slightly\r\nparaphrased from Terence--which he had characteristically adopted as his\r\nfamily motto, _Forti nihil difficile_; neither could there be any\r\nquestion as to the genuine nature either of his strength or his courage,\r\nalbeit hostile critics might seek to confound the latter quality with\r\nsheer impudence.[70] He abhorred the commonplace, and it is notably this\r\nabhorrence which gives a vivid, albeit somewhat meretricious sparkle to\r\nhis personality. For although truth is generally dull, and although\r\nprobably most of the reforms and changes which have really benefited\r\nmankind partake largely of the commonplace, the attraction of\r\nunconventionality and sensationalism cannot be denied. Disraeli made\r\nEnglish politics interesting, just as Ismail Pasha gave at one time a\r\nspurious interest to the politics of Egypt. No one could tell what would\r\nbe the next step taken by the juggler in Cairo or by that meteoric\r\nstatesman in London whom John Bright once called \"the great wizard of\r\nBuckinghamshire.\" When Disraeli disappeared from the stage, the\r\natmosphere may have become clearer, and possibly more healthy for the\r\nbody politic in the aggregate, but the level of interest fell, whilst\r\nthe barometer of dulness rose.\r\n\r\nIf the saying generally attributed to Buffon[71] that \"the style is the\r\nman,\" is correct, an examination of Disraeli's style ought to give a\r\ntrue insight into his character. There can be no question of the\r\nreadiness of his wit or of his superabundant power of sarcasm. Besides\r\nthe classic instances which have almost passed into proverbs, others,\r\nless well known, are recorded in these pages. The statement that \"from\r\nthe Chancellor of the Exchequer to an Undersecretary of State is a\r\ndescent from the sublime to the ridiculous\" is very witty. The\r\nwell-known description of Lord Derby as \"the Rupert of debate\" is both\r\nwitty and felicitous, whilst the sarcasm in the context, which is less\r\nwell known, is both witty and biting. The noble lord, Disraeli said, was\r\nlike Prince Rupert, because \"his charge was resistless, but when he\r\nreturned from the pursuit he always found his camp in the possession of\r\nthe enemy.\"\r\n\r\nA favourite subject of Disraeli's sarcasm in his campaign against Peel\r\nwas that the latter habitually borrowed the ideas of others. \"His\r\n(Peel's) life,\" he said, \"has been a great appropriation clause. He is a\r\nburglar of others' intellect.... From the days of the Conqueror to the\r\ntermination of the last reign there is no statesman who has committed\r\npolitical petty larceny on so great a scale.\"\r\n\r\nIn a happy and inimitable metaphor he likened Sir Robert Peel's action\r\nin throwing over Protection to that of the Sultan's admiral who, during\r\nthe campaign against Mehemet Ali, after preparing a vast armament which\r\nleft the Dardanelles hallowed by the blessings of \"all the muftis of the\r\nEmpire,\" discovered when he got to sea that he had \"an objection to\r\nwar,\" steered at once into the enemy's port, and then explained that\r\n\"the only reason he had for accepting the command was that he might\r\nterminate the contest by betraying his master.\"\r\n\r\nOther utterances of a similar nature abound, as, for instance, when he\r\nspoke of Lord Melbourne as \"sauntering over the destinies of a nation,\r\nand lounging away the glories of an Empire,\" or when he likened those\r\nTories who followed Sir Robert Peel to the Saxons converted by\r\nCharlemagne. \"The old chronicler informs us they were converted in\r\nbattalions and baptized in platoons.\"\r\n\r\nWarned by the fiasco of his first speech in the House of Commons,\r\nDisraeli for some while afterwards exercised a wise parsimony in the\r\ndisplay of his wit. He discovered that \"the House will not allow a man\r\nto be a wit and an orator unless they have the credit of finding it\r\nout.\" But when he had once established his position and gained the ear\r\nof the House, he gave a free rein to his prodigious powers of satire,\r\nwhich he used to the full in his attacks on Peel. In point of fact,\r\nvituperation and sarcasm were his chief weapons of offence. He spoke of\r\nMr. Roebuck as a \"meagre-minded rebel,\" and called Campbell, who was\r\nafterwards Lord Chancellor, \"a shrewd, coarse, manœuvring Pict,\" a\r\n\"base-born Scotchman,\" and a \"booing, fawning, jobbing progeny of haggis\r\nand cockaleekie.\" When he ceased to be witty, sarcastic, or\r\nvituperative, he became turgid. Nothing could be more witty than when,\r\nin allusion to Peel's borrowing the ideas of others, he spoke of his\r\nfiscal project as \"Popkins's Plan,\" but when, having once made this hit,\r\nwhich naturally elicited \"peals of laughter from all parts of the\r\nHouse,\" he proceeded further, he at once lapsed into cheap rhetoric.\r\n\r\n     \"Is England,\" he said, \"to be governed, and is England to be\r\n     convulsed, by Popkins's plan? Will he go to the country with it?\r\n     Will he go with it to that ancient and famous England that once was\r\n     governed by statesmen--by Burleighs and by Walsinghams; by\r\n     Bolingbrokes and by Walpoles; by a Chatham and a Canning--will he\r\n     go to it with this fantastic scheming of some presumptuous pedant?\r\n     I won't believe it. I have that confidence in the common sense, I\r\n     will say the common spirit of our countrymen, that I believe they\r\n     will not long endure this huckstering tyranny of the Treasury\r\n     Bench--these political pedlars that bought their party in the\r\n     cheapest market and sold us in the dearest.\"\r\n\r\nSo also on one occasion when in a characteristically fanciful flight he\r\nsaid that Canning ruled the House of Commons \"as a man rules a high-bred\r\nsteed, as Alexander ruled Bucephalus,\" and when some member of the House\r\nindulged in a very legitimate laugh, he turned on him at once and said,\r\n\"I thank that honourable gentleman for his laugh. The pulse of the\r\nnational heart does not beat as high as once it did. I know the temper\r\nof this House is not as spirited and brave as it was, nor am I\r\nsurprised, when the vulture rules where once the eagle reigned.\" From\r\nthe days of Horace downwards it has been permitted to actors and orators\r\nto pass rapidly from the comic to the tumid strain.[72] But in this case\r\nthe language was so bombastic and so utterly out of proportion to the\r\noccasion which called it forth that a critic of style will hardly acquit\r\nthe orator of the charge of turgidity. Mr. Monypenny recognises that\r\n\"in spite of Disraeli's strong grasp of fact, his keen sense of the\r\nridiculous, and his intolerance of cant, he never could quite\r\ndistinguish between the genuine and the counterfeit either in language\r\nor sentiment.\"\r\n\r\nMuch has at times been said and written of the solecisms for which\r\nDisraeli was famous. They came naturally to him. In his early youth he\r\ntold his sister that the Danube was an \"uncouth stream,\" because \"its\r\nbed is far too considerable for its volume.\" At the same time there can\r\nbe little doubt that his practice of indulging in carefully prepared\r\nsolecisms, which became more daring as he advanced in power, was part of\r\na deliberate and perfectly legitimate plan, conceived with the object of\r\narresting the attention and stimulating the interest of his audience.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have so far only dealt with Disraeli's main object in life, and with\r\nthe methods by which he endeavoured to attain that object. The important\r\nquestion remains to be considered of whether, as many supposed and still\r\nsuppose, Disraeli was a mere political charlatan, or whether, as others\r\nhold, he was a far-seeing statesman and profound thinker, who read the\r\nsigns of the times more clearly than his contemporaries, and who was\r\nthe early apostle of a political creed which his countrymen will do well\r\nto adopt and develop.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary here to say a word or two about Disraeli's biographer.\r\nThe charm of Mr. Monypenny's style, the lucidity of his narrative, the\r\nthorough grasp which he manifestly secured of the forces in movement\r\nduring the period which his history embraces, and the deep regret that\r\nall must feel that his promising career was prematurely cut short by the\r\nhand of death, should not blind us to the fact that, in spite of a\r\nmanifest attempt to write judicially, he must be regarded as an\r\napologist for Disraeli. In respect, indeed, to one point--which,\r\nhowever, is, in my opinion, one of great importance--he threw up the\r\ncase for his client. The facts of this case are very clear.\r\n\r\nWhen Peel formed his Ministry in 1841, no place was offered to Disraeli.\r\nIt can be no matter for surprise that he was deeply mortified. His\r\nexclusion does not appear to have been due to any personal feeling of\r\nanimosity entertained by Peel. On the contrary, Peel's relations with\r\nDisraeli had up to that time been of a very friendly character. Possibly\r\nsomething may be attributed to that lack of imagination which, at a much\r\nlater period, Disraeli thought was the main defect of Sir Robert Peel's\r\ncharacter, and which may have rendered him incapable of conceiving that\r\na young man, differing so totally not only from himself but from all\r\nother contemporaneous politicians in deportment and demeanour, could\r\never aspire to be a political factor of supreme importance. The\r\nexplanation given by Peel himself that, as is usual with Prime Ministers\r\nsimilarly situated, he was wholly unable to meet all the just claims\r\nmade upon him, was unquestionably true, but it is more than probable\r\nthat the episode related by Mr. Monypenny had something to do with\r\nDisraeli's exclusion. Peel, it appears, was inclined to consider\r\nDisraeli eligible for office, but Stanley (subsequently Lord Derby), who\r\nwas a typical representative of that \"patrician\" class whom Disraeli\r\ncourted and eventually dominated, stated \"in his usual vehement way\"\r\nthat \"if that scoundrel were taken in, he would not remain himself.\"\r\nHowever that may be, two facts are abundantly clear. One is that, in the\r\nagony of disappointment, Disraeli threw himself at Peel's feet and\r\nimplored, in terms which were almost abject, that some official place\r\nshould be found for him. \"I appeal,\" he said, in a letter dated\r\nSeptember 5, 1841, \"to that justice and that magnanimity which I feel\r\nare your characteristics, to save me from an intolerable humiliation.\"\r\nThe other fact is that, speaking to his constituents in 1844, he said:\r\n\"I never asked Sir Robert Peel for a place,\" and further that, speaking\r\nin the House of Commons in 1846, he repeated this statement even more\r\ncategorically. He assured the House that \"nothing of the kind ever\r\noccurred,\" and he added that \"it was totally foreign to his nature to\r\nmake an application for any place.\" He was evidently not believed. \"The\r\nimpression in the House,\" Mr. Monypenny says, \"was that Disraeli had\r\nbetter have remained silent.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Monypenny admits the facts, and does not attempt to defend\r\nDisraeli's conduct, but he passes over this very singular episode, which\r\nis highly illustrative of the character of the man, somewhat lightly,\r\nmerely remarking that though Disraeli \"must pay the full penalty,\" at\r\nthe same time \"it is for the politician who is without sin in the matter\r\nof veracity to cast the first stone.\"\r\n\r\nI hardly think that this consolatory Biblical reflection disposes of the\r\nmatter. Politicians, as also diplomatists, are often obliged to give\r\nevasive answers to inconvenient questions, but it is not possible for\r\nany man, when dealing with a point of primary importance, deliberately\r\nto make and to repeat a statement so absolutely untrue as that made by\r\nDisraeli on the occasion in question without undermining any confidence\r\nwhich might otherwise be entertained in his general sincerity and\r\nrectitude of purpose. A man convicted of deliberate falsehood cannot\r\nexpect to be believed when he pleads that his public conduct is wholly\r\ndictated by public motives. Now all the circumstantial evidence goes to\r\nshow that from 1841 onwards Disraeli's conduct, culminating in his\r\nviolent attacks on Peel in 1845-46, was the result of personal\r\nresentment due to his exclusion from office in 1841, and that these\r\nattacks would never have been made had he been able to climb the ladder\r\nof advancement by other means. His proved want of veracity confirms the\r\nimpression derived from this evidence.\r\n\r\nPeel's own opinion on the subject may be gathered from a letter which he\r\nwrote to Sir James Graham on December 22, 1843.[73] Disraeli had the\r\nassurance to solicit a place for his brother from Sir James Graham. The\r\nrequest met with a flat refusal. Peel's comment on the incident was: \"He\r\n(Disraeli) asked me for office himself, and I was not surprised that,\r\nbeing refused, he became independent and a patriot.\"\r\n\r\nSo far, therefore, as the individual is concerned, the episode on which\r\nI have dwelt above appears to me to be a very important factor in\r\nestimating not merely Disraeli's moral worth, but also the degree of\r\nvalue to be attached to his opinions. The question of whether Disraeli\r\nwas or was not a political charlatan remains, however, to be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nThat Disraeli was a political adventurer is abundantly clear. So was\r\nNapoleon, between whose mentality and that of Disraeli a somewhat close\r\nanalogy exists. Both subordinated their public conduct to the\r\nfurtherance of their personal aims. It is quite permissible to argue\r\nthat, as a political adventurer, Disraeli did an incalculable amount of\r\nharm in so far as he tainted the sincerity of public life both in his\r\nown person and, posthumously, by becoming the progenitor of a school of\r\nadventurers who adopted his methods. But it is quite possible to be a\r\nself-seeking adventurer without being a charlatan. A careful\r\nconsideration of Disraeli's opinions and actions leads me to the\r\nconclusion that only on a very superficial view of his career can the\r\nlatter epithet be applied to him. It must, I think, be admitted that his\r\nideas, even although we may disagree with them, were not those of a\r\ncharlatan, but of a statesman. They cannot be brushed aside as trivial.\r\nThey deserve serious consideration. Moreover, he had a very remarkable\r\npower of penetrating to the core of any question which he treated,\r\ncoupled with an aptitude for wide generalisation which is rare amongst\r\nEnglishmen, and which he probably derived from his foreign ancestors. An\r\ninstance in point is his epigrammatic statement that \"In England, where\r\nsociety was strong, they tolerated a weak Government, but in Ireland,\r\nwhere society was weak, the policy should be to have the Government\r\nstrong.\" Mr. Monypenny is quite justified in saying: \"The significance\r\nof the Irish question cannot be exhausted in a formula, but in that\r\nsingle sentence there is more of wisdom and enlightenment than in many\r\nthousands of the dreary pages of Irish debate that are buried in the\r\nvolumes of Hansard.\"\r\n\r\nMore than this. In one very important respect he was half a century in\r\nadvance of his contemporaries. With true political instinct he fell upon\r\nwhat was unquestionably the weakest point in the armour of the so-called\r\nManchester School of politicians. He saw that whilst material\r\ncivilisation in England was advancing with rapid strides, there was \"no\r\nproportionate advance in our moral civilisation.\" \"In the hurry-skurry\r\nof money-making, men-making, and machine-making,\" the moral side of\r\nnational life was being unduly neglected. He was able with justifiable\r\npride to say: \"Long before what is called the 'condition of the people\r\nquestion' was discussed in the House of Commons, I had employed my pen\r\non the subject. I had long been aware that there was something rotten in\r\nthe core of our social system. I had seen that while immense fortunes\r\nwere accumulating, while wealth was increasing to a superabundance, and\r\nwhile Great Britain was cited throughout Europe as the most prosperous\r\nnation in the world, the working classes, the creators of wealth, were\r\nsteeped in the most abject poverty and gradually sinking into the\r\ndeepest degradation.\" The generation of 1912 cannot dub as a charlatan\r\nthe man who could speak thus in 1844. For in truth, more especially\r\nduring the last five years, we have been suffering from a failure to\r\nrecognise betimes the truth of this foreseeing statesman's admonition.\r\nHaving for years neglected social reform, we have recently tried to make\r\nup for lost time by the hurried adoption of a number of measures, often\r\nfaulty in principle and ill-considered in detail, which seek to obtain\r\nby frenzied haste those advantages which can only be secured by the\r\nstrenuous and persistent application of sound principles embodied in\r\ndeliberate and well-conceived legislative enactments.\r\n\r\nDisraeli, therefore, saw the rock ahead, but how did he endeavour to\r\nsteer the ship clear of the rock? It is in dealing with this aspect of\r\nthe case that the view of the statesman dwindles away and is supplanted\r\nby that of the self-seeking party manager. His fundamental idea was that\r\n\"we had altogether outgrown, not the spirit, but the organisation of our\r\ninstitutions.\" The manner in which he proposed to reorganise our\r\ninstitutions was practically to render the middle classes politically\r\npowerless. His scheme, constituting the germ which, at a later period,\r\nblossomed into the Tory democracy, was developed as early as 1840 in a\r\nletter addressed to Mr. Charles Attwood, who was at that time a popular\r\nleader. \"I entirely agree with you,\" he said, \"that an union between the\r\nConservative Party and the Radical masses offers the only means by which\r\nwe can preserve the Empire. Their interests are identical; united they\r\nform the nation; and their division has only permitted a miserable\r\nminority, under the specious name of the People, to assail all right of\r\nproperty and person.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Monypenny, if I understand rightly, is generally in sympathy with\r\nDisraeli's project, and appears to think that it might have been\r\npracticable to carry it into effect. He condemns Peel's counter-idea of\r\nsubstituting a middle-class Toryism for that which then existed as\r\n\"almost a contradiction in terms.\" I am unable to concur in this view. I\r\nsee no contradiction, either real or apparent, in Peel's\r\ncounter-project, and I hold that events have proved that the premises on\r\nwhich Disraeli based his conclusion were entirely false, for his\r\npolitical descendants, while still pursuing his main aim, viz. to ensure\r\na closer association of the Conservative Party and the masses, have been\r\nforced by circumstances into an endeavour to effect that union by means\r\nnot merely different from but antagonistic to those which Disraeli\r\nhimself contemplated.\r\n\r\nIt all depends on what Disraeli meant when he spoke of \"Conservatism,\"\r\nand on what Mr. Monypenny meant when he spoke of \"Toryism.\" It may\r\nreadily be conceded that a \"middle-class Toryism,\" in the sense in which\r\nDisraeli would have understood the expression, was \"a contradiction in\r\nterms,\" for the bed-rock on which his Toryism was based was that it\r\nshould find its main strength in the possessors of land. The creation of\r\nsuch a Toryism is a conceivable political programme. In France it was\r\ncreated by the division of property consequent on the Revolution. Thiers\r\nsaid truly enough that in the cottage of every French peasant owning an\r\nacre of land would be found a musket ready to be used in the defence of\r\nproperty. In fact, the five million peasant proprietors now existing in\r\nFrance represent an eminently conservative class. But, so far as I know,\r\nthere is not a trace to be found in any of Disraeli's utterances that he\r\nwished to widen the basis of agricultural conservatism by creating a\r\npeasant proprietary class. He wished, above all things, to maintain the\r\nterritorial magnates in the full possession of their properties. When he\r\nspoke of a \"union between the Conservative Party and the Radical masses\"\r\nhe meant a union between the \"patricians\" and the working men, and the\r\nanswer to this somewhat fantastic project is that given by Juvenal 1800\r\nyears ago:\r\n\r\n        Quis enim iam non intelligat artes\r\n    Patricias?[74]\r\n\r\n\"Who in our days is not up to the dodges of the patricians?\"\r\n\r\nThe programme was foredoomed to failure, and the failure has been\r\ncomplete. Modern Conservatives can appeal to the middle classes, who--in\r\nspite of what Mr. Monypenny says--are their natural allies. They can\r\nalso appeal to the working classes by educating them and by showing them\r\nthat Socialism is diametrically contrary to their own interests. But,\r\nalthough they may gain some barren and ephemeral electoral advantages,\r\nthey cannot hope to advance the cause of rational conservative progress\r\neither by alienating the one class or by sailing under false colours\r\nbefore the other. They cannot advantageously masquerade in Radical\r\nclothes. There was a profound truth in Lord Goschen's view upon the\r\nconduct of Disraeli when, in strict accordance with the principles he\r\nenunciated in the 'forties, he forced his reluctant followers to pass a\r\nReform Bill far more Radical than that proposed by the Whigs. \"That\r\nmeasure,\" Lord Goschen said,[75] \"might have increased the number of\r\nConservatives, but it had, nevertheless, in his belief, weakened real\r\nConservatism.\" Many of Disraeli's political descendants seem to care\r\nlittle for Conservatism, but they are prepared to advocate Socialist or\r\nquasi-Socialist doctrines in order to increase the number of nominal\r\nConservatives. This, therefore, has been the ultimate result of the\r\ngospel of which Disraeli was the chief apostle. It does no credit to his\r\npolitical foresight. He altogether failed to see the consequences which\r\nwould result from the adoption of his political principles. He hoped\r\nthat the Radical masses, whom he sought to conciliate, would look to the\r\n\"patricians\" as their guides. They have done nothing of the sort, but a\r\nvery distinct tendency has been created amongst the \"patricians\" to\r\nallow themselves to be guided by the Radical masses.\r\n\r\nI cannot terminate these remarks without saying a word or two about\r\nDisraeli's great antagonist, Peel. It appears to me that Mr. Monypenny\r\nscarcely does justice to that very eminent man. His main accusation\r\nagainst Peel is that he committed his country \"apparently past recall\"\r\nto an industrial line of growth, and that he sacrificed rural England\r\n\"to a one-sided and exaggerated industrial development which has done\r\nso much to change the English character and the English outlook.\"\r\n\r\nI think that this charge admits of being answered, but I will not now\r\nattempt to answer it fully. This much, however, I may say. Mr.\r\nMonypenny, if I understand rightly, admits that the transition from\r\nagriculture to manufactures was, if not desirable, at all events\r\ninevitable, but he holds that this transition should have been gradual.\r\nThis is practically the same view as that held by the earlier German and\r\nAmerican economists, who--whilst condemning Protection in\r\ntheory--advocated it as a temporary measure which would eventually lead\r\nup to Free Trade. The answer is that, in those countries which adopted\r\nthis policy, the Protection has, in the face of vested interests, been\r\npermanent, whilst, although the movement in favour of Free Trade has\r\nnever entirely died out, and may, indeed, be said recently to have shown\r\nsigns of increasing vigour, the obstacles to the realisation of the\r\nideas entertained by economists of the type of List have not yet been\r\nremoved, and are still very formidable. That the plunge made by Sir\r\nRobert Peel has been accompanied by some disadvantages may be admitted,\r\nbut Free Traders may be pardoned for thinking that, if he had not had\r\nthe courage to make that plunge, the enormous counter-advantages which\r\nhave resulted from his policy would never have accrued.\r\n\r\nAs regards Peel's character, it was twice sketched by Disraeli himself.\r\nThe first occasion was in 1839. The picture he drew at that time was\r\nhighly complimentary, but as Disraeli was then a loyal supporter of Peel\r\nit may perhaps be discarded on the plea advanced by Voltaire that \"we\r\ncan confidently believe only the evil which a party writer tells of his\r\nown side and the good which he recognises in his opponents.\" The second\r\noccasion was after Peel's death. It is given by Mr. Monypenny in ii.\r\n306-308, and is too long to quote. Disraeli on this occasion made some\r\nfew--probably sound--minor criticisms on Peel's style, manner, and\r\ndisposition. But he manifestly wrote with a strong desire to do justice\r\nto his old antagonist's fine qualities. He concluded with a remark\r\nwhich, in the mouth of a Parliamentarian, may probably be considered the\r\nhighest praise, namely, that Peel was \"the greatest Member of Parliament\r\nthat ever lived.\" I cannot but think that even those who reject Peel's\r\neconomic principles may accord to him higher praise than this. They may\r\nadmit that Peel attained a very high degree of moral elevation when, at\r\nthe dictate of duty, he separated himself from all--or the greater\r\npart--of his former friends, and had the courage, when honestly\r\nconvinced by Cobden's arguments, to act upon his convictions. Peel's\r\nfinal utterance on this subject was not only one of the most pathetic,\r\nbut also one of the finest--because one of the most deeply\r\nsincere--speeches ever made in Parliament.\r\n\r\nI may conclude these remarks by some recollections of a personal\r\ncharacter. My father, who died in 1848, was a Peelite and an intimate\r\nfriend of Sir Robert Peel, who was frequently his guest at Cromer. I\r\nused, therefore, in my childhood to hear a good deal of the subjects\r\ntreated in Mr. Monypenny's brilliant volumes. I well remember--I think\r\nit must have been in 1847--being present on one occasion when a relative\r\nof my own, who was a broad-acred Nottinghamshire squire, thumped the\r\ntable and declared his opinion that \"Sir Robert Peel ought to be hanged\r\non the highest tree in England.\" Since that time I have heard a good\r\nmany statesmen accused of ruining their country, but, so far as my\r\nrecollection serves me, the denunciations launched against John Bright,\r\nGladstone, and even the present Chancellor of the Exchequer, may be\r\nconsidered as sweetly reasonable by comparison with the language\r\nemployed about Sir Robert Peel by those who were opposed to his policy.\r\n\r\nI was only once brought into personal communication with Disraeli.\r\nHappening to call on my old friend, Lord Rowton, in the summer of 1879,\r\nwhen I was about to return to Egypt as Controller-General, he expressed\r\na wish that I should see Lord Beaconsfield, as he then was. The\r\ninterview was very short; neither has anything Lord Beaconsfield said\r\nabout Egyptian affairs remained in my memory. But I remember that he\r\nappeared much interested to learn whether \"there were many pelicans on\r\nthe banks of the Nile.\"\r\n\r\nThe late Sir Mountstuart Grant-Duff was a repository of numerous very\r\namusing _Beaconsfieldiana_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: This passage occurs in _Coningsby_, and Mr. Monypenny\r\nwarns us that \"his version of the quarrel between Charles I. and the\r\nParliament is too fanciful to be quite serious; we may believe that he\r\nwas here consciously paying tribute to the historical caprices of\r\nManners and Smythe.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: Mr. Monypenny says in a note that a hostile newspaper gave\r\nthe following translation of Disraeli's motto: \"The impudence of some\r\nmen sticks at nothing.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: What Buffon really wrote was: \"Le style est l'homme\r\nmême.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72:\r\n\r\n    Iratusque Chremes tumido delitigat ore;\r\n    Et tragicus plerumque dolet sermone pedestri\r\n    Telephus et Peleus.\r\n\r\n_Ars Poetica_, 94-96.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: _Sir Robert Peel_.

Elliot, p. 163.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nRUSSIAN ROMANCE\r\n\r\n_\"The Spectator,\" March 15, 1913_\r\n\r\n\r\nDe Vogüé's well-known book, _Le Roman Russe_, was published so long ago\r\nas 1886. It is still well worth reading. In the first place, the\r\nliterary style is altogether admirable. It is the perfection of French\r\nprose, and to read the best French prose is always an intellectual\r\ntreat. In the second place, the author displays in a marked degree that\r\npower of wide generalisation which distinguishes the best French\r\nwriters. Then, again, M. de Vogüé writes with a very thorough knowledge\r\nof his subject. He resided for long in Russia. He spoke Russian, and had\r\nan intimate acquaintance with Russian literature. He endeavoured to\r\nidentify himself with Russian aspirations, and, being himself a man of\r\npoetic and imaginative temperament, he was able to sympathise with the\r\nhighly emotional side of the Slav character, whilst, at the same time,\r\nhe never lost sight of the fact that he was the representative of a\r\ncivilisation which is superior to that of Russia. He admires the\r\neruptions of that volcanic genius Dostoïevsky, but, with true European\r\ninstinct, charges him with a want of \"mesure\"--the Greek\r\nSophrosyne--which he defines as \"l'art d'assujettir ses pensées.\"\r\nMoreover, he at times brings a dose of vivacious French wit to temper\r\nthe gloom of Russian realism. Thus, when he speaks of the Russian\r\nwriters of romance, who, from 1830 to 1840, \"eurent le privilège de\r\nfaire pleurer les jeunes filles russes,\" he observes in thorough\r\nman-of-the-world fashion, \"il faut toujours que quelqu'un fasse pleurer\r\nles jeunes filles, mais le génie n'y est pas nécessaire.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Taine had finished his great history of the Revolution, he sent it\r\nforth to the world with the remark that the only general conclusion at\r\nwhich a profound study of the facts had enabled him to arrive was that\r\nthe true comprehension, and therefore, _a fortiori_, the government of\r\nhuman beings, and especially of Frenchmen, was an extremely difficult\r\nmatter. Those who have lived longest in the East are the first to\r\ntestify to the fact that, to the Western mind, the Oriental habit of\r\nthought is well-nigh incomprehensible. The European may do his best to\r\nunderstand, but he cannot cast off his love of symmetry any more than he\r\ncan change his skin, and unless he can become asymmetrical he can never\r\nhope to attune his reason in perfect accordance to the Oriental key.\r\nSimilarly, it is impossible to rise from a perusal of De Vogüé's book\r\nwithout a strong feeling of the incomprehensibility of the Russians.\r\n\r\nWhat, in fact, are these puzzling Russians? They are certainly not\r\nEuropeans. They possess none of the mental equipoise of the Teutons,\r\nneither do they appear to possess that logical faculty which, in spite\r\nof many wayward outbursts of passion, generally enables the Latin races\r\nin the end to cast off idealism when it tends to lapse altogether from\r\nsanity; or perhaps it would be more correct to say that, having by\r\nassociation acquired some portion of that Western faculty, the Russians\r\nmisapply it. They seem to be impelled by a variety of causes--such as\r\nclimatic and economic influences, a long course of misgovernment,\r\nByzantinism in religion, and an inherited leaning to Oriental\r\nmysticism--to distort their reasoning powers, and far from using them,\r\nas was the case with the pre-eminently sane Greek genius, to temper the\r\nexcesses of the imagination, to employ them rather as an oestrus to lash\r\nthe imaginative faculties to a state verging on madness.\r\n\r\nIf the Russians are not Europeans, neither are they thorough Asiatics.\r\nIt may well be, as De Vogüé says, that they have preserved the idiom\r\nand even the features of their original Aryan ancestors to a greater\r\nextent than has been the case with other Aryan nations who finally\r\nsettled farther West, and that this is a fact of which many Russians\r\nboast. But, for all that, they have been inoculated with far too strong\r\na dose of Western culture, religion, and habits of thought to display\r\nthe apathy or submit to the fatalism which characterises the conduct of\r\nthe true Eastern.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, the Russians are neither Europeans nor Asiatics, what are\r\nthey? Manifestly their geographical position and other attendant\r\ncircumstances have, from an ethnological point of view, rendered them a\r\nhybrid race, whose national development will display the most startling\r\nanomalies and contradictions, in which the theory and practice derived\r\nfrom the original Oriental stock will be constantly struggling for\r\nmastery with an Occidental aftergrowth. From the earliest days there\r\nhave been two types of Russian reformers, viz. on the one hand, those\r\nwho wished that the country should be developed on Eastern lines, and,\r\non the other, those who looked to Western civilisation for guidance. De\r\nVogüé says that from the accession of Peter the Great to the death of\r\nthe Emperor Nicolas--that is to say, for a period of a hundred and\r\nfifty years--the government of Russia may be likened to a ship, of\r\nwhich the captain and the principal officers were persistently\r\nendeavouring to steer towards the West, while at the same time the whole\r\nof the crew were trimming the sails in order to catch any breeze which\r\nwould bear the vessel Eastward. It can be no matter for surprise that\r\nthis strange medley should have produced results which are bewildering\r\neven to Russians themselves and well-nigh incomprehensible to\r\nforeigners. One of their poets has said:\r\n\r\n    On ne comprend pas la Russie avec la raison,\r\n    On ne peut que croire à la Russie.\r\n\r\nOne of the most singular incidents of Russian development on which De\r\nVogüé has fastened, and which induced him to write this book, has been\r\nthe predominant influence exercised on Russian thought and action by\r\nnovels. Writers of romance have indeed at times exercised no\r\ninconsiderable amount of influence elsewhere than in Russia. Mrs.\r\nBeecher Stowe's epoch-making novel, _Uncle Tom's Cabin_, certainly\r\ncontributed towards the abolition of slavery in the United States.\r\nDickens gave a powerful impetus to the reform of our law-courts and our\r\nPoor Law. Moreover, even in free England, political writers have at\r\ntimes resorted to allegory in order to promulgate their ideas. Swift's\r\nBrobdingnagians and Lilliputians furnish a case in point. In France,\r\nVoltaire called fictitious Chinamen, Bulgarians, and Avars into\r\nexistence in order to satirise the proceedings of his own countrymen.\r\nBut the effect produced by these writings may be classed as trivial\r\ncompared to that exercised by the great writers of Russian romance. In\r\nthe works of men like Tourguenef and Dostoïevsky the Russian people\r\nappear to have recognised, for the first time, that their real condition\r\nwas truthfully depicted, and that their inchoate aspirations had found\r\nsympathetic expression. \"Dans le roman, et là seulement,\" De Vogüé says,\r\n\"on trouvera l'histoire de Russie depuis un demi-siècle.\"\r\n\r\nSuch being the case, it becomes of interest to form a correct judgment\r\non the character and careers of the men whom the Russians have very\r\ngenerally regarded as the true interpreters of their domestic facts, and\r\nwhom large numbers of them have accepted as their political pilots.\r\n\r\nThe first point to be noted about them is that they are all, for the\r\nmost part, ultra-realists; but apparently we may search their writings\r\nin vain for the cheerfulness which at times illumines the pages of their\r\nEnglish, or the light-hearted vivacity which sparkles in the pages of\r\ntheir French counterparts. In Dostoïevsky's powerfully written _Crime\r\nand Punishment_ all is gloom and horror; the hero of the tale is a\r\nmadman and a murderer. To a foreigner these authors seem to present the\r\npicture of a society oppressed with an all-pervading sense of the misery\r\nof existence, and with the impossibility of finding any means by which\r\nthat misery can be alleviated. In many instances, their lives--and still\r\nmore their deaths--were as sad and depressing as their thoughts. Several\r\nof their most noted authors died violent deaths. At thirty-seven years\r\nof age the poet Pouchkine was killed in a duel, Lermontof met the same\r\nfate at the age of twenty-six. Griboïédof was assassinated at the age of\r\nthirty-four. But the most tragic history is that of Dostoïevsky, albeit\r\nhe lived to a green old age, and eventually died a natural death. In\r\n1849, he was connected with some political society, but he does not\r\nappear, even at that time, to have been a violent politician.\r\nNevertheless, he and his companions, after being kept for several months\r\nin close confinement, were condemned to death. They were brought to the\r\nplace of execution, but at the last moment, when the soldiers were about\r\nto fire, their sentences were commuted to exile. Dostoïevsky remained\r\nfor some years in Siberia, but was eventually allowed to return to\r\nRussia. The inhuman cruelty to which he had been subject naturally\r\ndominated his mind and inspired his pen for the remainder of his days.\r\n\r\nDe Vogüé deals almost exclusively with the writings of Pouchkine, Gogol,\r\nDostoïevsky, Tourguenef, who was the inventor of the word Nihilism, and\r\nthe mystic Tolstoy, who was the principal apostle of the doctrine. All\r\nthese, with the possible exception of Tourguenef, had one characteristic\r\nin common. Their intellects were in a state of unstable equilibrium. As\r\npoets, they could excite the enthusiasm of the masses, but as political\r\nguides they were mere Jack-o'-Lanterns, leading to the deadly swamp of\r\ndespair. Dostoïevsky was in some respects the most interesting and also\r\nthe most typical of the group. De Vogüé met him in his old age, and the\r\naccount he gives of his appearance is most graphic. His history could be\r\nread in his face.\r\n\r\n     On y lisait mieux que dans le livre, les souvenirs de la maison des\r\n     morts, les longues habitudes d'effroi, de méfiance et de martyre.\r\n     Les paupières, les lèvres, toutes les fibres de cette face\r\n     tremblaient de tics nerveux. Quand il s'animait de colère sur une\r\n     idée, on eût juré qu'on avait déjà vu cette tête sur les banes\r\n     d'une cour criminelle, ou parmi les vagabonds qui mendient aux\r\n     portes des prisons. A d'autres moments, elle avait la mansuétude\r\n     triste des vieux saints sur les images slavonnes.\r\n\r\nAnd here is what De Vogüé says of the writings of this semi-lunatic man\r\nof genius:\r\n\r\n     Psychologue incomparable, dès qu'il étudie des âmes noires ou\r\n     blessées, dramaturge habile, mais borné aux scènes d'effroi et de\r\n     pitié.... Selon qu'on est plus touché par tel ou tel excès de son\r\n     talent, on peut l'appeler avec justice un philosophe, un apôtre, un\r\n     aliéné, le consolateur des affligés ou le bourreau des esprits\r\n     tranquilles, le Jérémie de bagne ou le Shakespeare de la maison des\r\n     fous; toutes ces appellations seront méritées; prise isolément,\r\n     aucune ne sera suffisante.\r\n\r\nThere is manifestly much which is deeply interesting, and also much\r\nwhich is really lovable in the Russian national character. It must,\r\nhowever, be singularly mournful and unpleasant to pass through life\r\nburdened with the reflection that it would have been better not to have\r\nbeen born, albeit such sentiments are not altogether inconsistent with\r\nthe power of deriving a certain amount of enjoyment from living. It was\r\nthat pleasure-loving old cynic, Madame du Deffand, who said: \"Il n'y a\r\nqu'un seul malheur, celui d'être né.\" Nevertheless, the avowed\r\njoyousness bred by the laughing tides and purple skies of Greece is\r\ncertainly more conducive to human happiness, though at times even\r\nGreeks, such as Theognis and Palladas, lapsed into a morbid pessimism\r\ncomparable to that of Tolstoy. Metrodorus, however, more fully\r\nrepresented the true Greek spirit when he sang, \"All things are good in\r\nlife\" (πάντα γὰρ ἐσθλὰ βίῳ). The Roman pagan, Juvenal, gave a fairly\r\nsatisfactory answer to the question, \"Nil ergo optabunt homines?\"\r\nwhilst the Christian holds out hopes of that compensation in the next\r\nworld for the afflictions of the present, which the sombre and\r\ndespondent Russian philosopher, determined that we shall not find\r\nenjoyment in either world, denies to his morose and grief-stricken\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nTHE WRITING OF HISTORY[76]\r\n\r\n_\"The Spectator,\" April 26, 1913_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the purposes of history, and in what spirit should it be\r\nwritten? Such, in effect, are the questions which Mr. Gooch propounds in\r\nthis very interesting volume. He wisely abstains from giving any\r\ndogmatic answers to these questions, but in a work which shows manifest\r\nsigns of great erudition and far-reaching research he ranges over the\r\nwhole field of European and American literature, and gives us a very\r\ncomplete summary both of how, as a matter of fact, history has been\r\nwritten, and of the spirit in which the leading historians of the\r\nnineteenth century have approached their task.\r\n\r\nMr. Bryce, himself one of the most eminent of modern historians,\r\nrecently laid down the main principle which, in his opinion, should\r\nguide his fellow-craftsmen. \"Truth,\" he said, \"and truth only is our\r\naim.\" The maxim is one which would probably be unreservedly accepted in\r\ntheory by the most ardent propagandist who has ever used history as a\r\nvehicle for the dissemination of his own views on political, economic,\r\nor social questions. For so fallible is human nature that the\r\nproclivities of the individual can rarely be entirely submerged by the\r\njudicial impartiality of the historian. It is impossible to peruse Mr.\r\nGooch's work without being struck by the fact that, amongst the greatest\r\nwriters of history, bias--often unconscious bias--has been the rule, and\r\nthe total absence of preconceived opinions the exception. Generally\r\nspeaking, the subjective spirit has prevailed amongst historians in all\r\nages. The danger of following the scent of analogies--not infrequently\r\nsomewhat strained analogies--between the present and the past is\r\ncomparatively less imminent in cases where some huge upheaval, such as\r\nthe French Revolution, has inaugurated an entirely new epoch,\r\naccompanied by the introduction of fresh ideals and habits of thought.\r\nIt is, as Macaulay has somewhere observed, a more serious\r\nstumbling-block in the path of a writer who deals with the history of a\r\ncountry like England, which has through long centuries preserved its\r\nhistorical continuity. Hallam and Macaulay viewed history through Whig,\r\nand Alison through Tory spectacles. Neither has the remoteness of the\r\nevents described proved any adequate safeguard against the introduction\r\nof bias born of contemporary circumstances. Mitford, who composed his\r\nhistory of Greece during the stormy times of the French Revolution,\r\nthought it compatible with his duty as an historian to strike a blow at\r\nWhigs and Jacobins. Grote's sympathy with the democracy of Athens was\r\nunquestionably to some extent the outcome of the views which he\r\nentertained of events passing under his own eyes at Westminster.\r\nMommsen, by inaugurating the publication of the Corpus of Latin\r\nInscriptions, has earned the eternal gratitude of scholarly posterity,\r\nbut Mr. Gooch very truly remarks that his historical work is tainted\r\nwith the \"strident partisanship\" of a keen politician and journalist.\r\nTruth, as the old Greek adage says, is indeed the fellow-citizen of the\r\ngods; but if the standard of historical truth be rated too high, and if\r\nthe authority of all who have not strictly complied with that standard\r\nis to be discarded on the ground that they stand convicted of\r\npartiality, we should be left with little to instruct subsequent ages\r\nbeyond the dry records of men such as the laborious, the useful, though\r\nsomewhat over-credulous Clinton, or the learned but arid Marquardt,\r\nwhose \"massive scholarship\" Mr. Gooch dismisses somewhat summarily in a\r\nsingle line. Such writers are not historians, but rather compilers of\r\nrecords, upon the foundations of which others can build history.\r\n\r\nUnder the process we have assumed, Droysen, Sybel, and Treitschke would\r\nhave to be cast down from their pedestals. They were the political\r\nschoolmasters of Germany during a period of profound national\r\ndiscouragement. They used history in order to stir their countrymen to\r\naction, but \"if the supreme aim of history is to discover truth and to\r\ninterpret the movement of humanity, they have no claim to a place in the\r\nfirst class.\" Patriotism, as the Portuguese historian, Herculano da\r\nCarvalho, said, is \"a bad counsellor for historians\"; albeit, few have\r\nhad the courage to discard patriotic considerations altogether, as was\r\nthe case with the Swiss Kopp, who wrote a history of his country \"from\r\nwhich Gessler and Tell disappeared,\" and in which \"the familiar\r\nanecdotes of Austrian tyranny and cruelty were dismissed as legends.\"\r\n\r\nPhilosophic historians, who have endeavoured to bend facts into\r\nconformity with some special theory of their own, would fare little\r\nbetter than those who have been ardent politicians. Sainte-Beuve, after\r\nreading Guizot's sweeping and lofty generalisations, declared that they\r\nwere far too logical to be true, and forthwith \"took down from his\r\nshelves a volume of De Retz to remind him how history was really made.\"\r\nSecond-or third-rate historians, such as Lamartine, who, according to\r\nDumas, \"raised history to the level of the novel,\" or the vitriolic\r\nLanfrey, who was a mere pamphleteer, would, of course, be consigned--and\r\nvery rightly consigned--to utter oblivion. The notorious inaccuracy of\r\nThiers and the avowed hero-worship of Masson alike preclude their\r\nadmissibility into the select circle of trustworthy and veracious\r\nhistorians. It is even questionable whether one of the most objectively\r\nminded of French writers, the illustrious Taine, would gain admission.\r\nHis work, he himself declared, \"was nothing but pure or applied\r\npsychology,\" and psychology is apt to clash with the facts of history.\r\nScherer described Taine, somewhat unjustly, as \"a pessimist in a\r\npassion,\" whilst the critical and conscientious Aulard declared that his\r\nwork was \"virtually useless for the purposes of history.\" Mr. Gooch\r\nclasses Sorel's work as \"incomparably higher\" than that of Taine.\r\nMontalembert is an extreme case of a French historian who adopted\r\nthoroughly unsound historical methods. Clearly, as Mr. Gooch says, \"the\r\nauthor of the famous battle-cry, 'We are the sons of the Crusades, and\r\nwe will never yield to the sons of Voltaire,' was not the man for\r\nobjective study.\"\r\n\r\nThe fate of some of the most distinguished American and British\r\nhistorians would be even more calamitous than that of their Continental\r\nbrethren. If the touchstone of impartiality were applied, Prescott might\r\nperhaps pass unscathed through the trial. But few will deny that Motley\r\nwrote his very attractive histories at a white heat of Republican and\r\nanti-Catholic fervour. He, as also Bancroft, are classed by Mr. Gooch\r\namongst those who \"made their histories the vehicles of political and\r\nreligious propaganda.\" Washington Irving's claim to rank in the first\r\nclass of historians may be dismissed on other grounds. \"He had no taste\r\nfor research,\" and merely presented to the world \"a poet's appreciation\"\r\nof historical events.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the two greatest sinners against the code of frigid\r\nimpartiality were Froude and Carlyle. Both were intensely convinced of\r\nthe truth of the gospel which they preached, and both were careless of\r\ndetail if they could strain the facts of history to support their\r\ndoctrines. The apotheosis of the strong man formed no part of Carlyle's\r\noriginal philosophy. In 1830, he wrote: \"Which was the greatest\r\nbenefactor, he who gained the battles of Cannae and Trasimene or the\r\nnameless poor who first hammered out for himself an iron spade?\" He\r\ncondemned Scott's historical writings: \"Strange,\" he said, \"that a man\r\nshould think he was writing the history of a nation while he is\r\ndescribing the amours of a wanton young woman and a sulky booby blown up\r\nwith gunpowder.\" After having slighted biography in this\r\ncharacteristically Carlylese utterance, he straightway set to work, with\r\nsplendid inconsistency, to base his philosophy of history mainly on the\r\nbiographies of men of the type of Cromwell and Frederic.\r\n\r\nThe invective levelled against Froude by Freeman is now generally\r\nrecognised as exaggerated and unjust, but it would certainly appear, as\r\nMr. Gooch says, that Froude \"never realised that the main duty of the\r\nhistorian is neither eulogy nor criticism, but interpretation of the\r\ncomplex processes and conflicting ideals which have built up the\r\nchequered life of humanity.\"\r\n\r\nYet when all is said that can be said on the necessity of insisting on\r\nhistorical veracity, it has to be borne in mind that inaccuracy is not\r\nthe only pitfall which lies in the path of the expounder of truth.\r\nHistory is not written merely for students and scholars. It ought to\r\ninstruct and enlighten the statesman. It should quicken the intelligence\r\nof the masses. Whilst any tendency to distort facts, or to sway public\r\nopinion by sensational writing of questionable veracity, cannot be too\r\nstrongly condemned, it is none the less true that it requires not merely\r\na touch of literary genius, but also a lively and receptive imagination\r\nto tell a perfectly truthful tale in such a manner as to arrest the\r\nattention, to excite the wayward imagination and to guide the thoughts\r\nof the vast majority of those who will scan the finished work of the\r\nhistorian. It is here that some of the best writers of history have\r\nfailed, Gardiner has written what is probably the best, and is certainly\r\nthe most dispassionate and impartial history of the Stuart period. \"With\r\none exception,\" Mr. Gooch says, \"Gardiner possessed all the tools of his\r\ncraft--an accurate mind, perfect impartiality, insight into character,\r\nsympathy with ideas different from his own and from one another. The\r\nexception was style. Had he possessed this talisman his noble work would\r\nhave been a popular classic. His pages are wholly lacking in grace and\r\ndistinction.\" The result is that Gardiner's really fine work has proved\r\nan ineffectual instrument for historical education. The majority of\r\nreaders will continue to turn to the brilliant if relatively partial\r\npages of Macaulay.\r\n\r\nThe case of Freeman, though different from that of Gardiner, for his\r\nstyle, though lacking in grace and flexibility was vigorous, may serve\r\nas another illustration of the same thesis. Freeman was a keen\r\npolitician, but he would never have for a moment entertained the thought\r\nof departing by one iota from strict historical truth in order to\r\nfurther any political cause in which he was interested. Mr. Gooch says,\r\n\"He regarded history as not only primarily, but almost exclusively, a\r\nrecord of political events. Past politics, he used to say, were present\r\nhistory.\" Why is it, therefore, that his works are little read, and that\r\nthey have exercised but slight influence on the opinions of the mass of\r\nhis countrymen? The answer is supplied by Mr. Gooch. Freeman ignored\r\norganic evolution. \"The world of ideas had no existence for him.... No\r\nless philosophic historian has ever lived.\" For one man who, with\r\neffort, has toiled through Freeman's ponderous but severely accurate\r\nNorman and Sicilian histories, there are probably a hundred whose\r\nimagination has been fired by Carlyle's rhapsody on the French\r\nRevolution, or who have pored with interested delight over Froude's\r\naccount of the death of Cranmer.\r\n\r\nMuch the same may be said of Creighton's intrinsically valuable but\r\nsomewhat colourless work. \"He had no theories,\" Mr. Gooch says, \"no\r\nphilosophy of history, no wish to prove or disprove anything.\" He took\r\nhistorical facts as they came, and recorded them. \"When events are\r\ntedious,\" he wrote, \"we must be tedious.\"\r\n\r\nThe most meritorious, as also the most popular historians are probably\r\nthose of the didactic school. Of these, Seeley and Acton are notable\r\ninstances. Seeley always endeavoured to establish some principle which\r\nwould capture the attention of the student and might be of interest to\r\nthe statesman. He held that \"history faded into mere literature when it\r\nlost sight of its relation to practical politics.\" Acton, who brought\r\nhis encyclopaedic learning to bear on the defence of liberty in all its\r\nforms, \"believed that historical study was not merely the basis of all\r\nreal insight into the present, but a school of virtue and a guide to\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\nLimitations of space preclude any adequate treatment of the illuminating\r\nwork done by Ranke, whom Mr. Gooch regards as the nearest approximation\r\nthe world has yet known to the \"ideal historian\"; by Lecky, who was\r\ndriven by the Home Rule conflict from the ranks of historians into those\r\nof politicians; by Milman, whose style, in the opinion of Macaulay, was\r\nwanting in grace and colour, but who was distinguished for his\r\n\"soundness of judgment and inexorable love of truth\"; by Otfried Müller,\r\nBérard, Gilbert Murray, and numerous other classical scholars of divers\r\nnationalities; by Fustel de Coulanges, the greatest of\r\nnineteenth-century mediaevalists; by Mahan, whose writings have\r\nexercised a marked influence on current politics, and who is thus an\r\ninstance of \"an historian who has helped to make history as well as to\r\nrecord it,\" and by a host of others.\r\n\r\nAt the close of his book Mr. Gooch very truly points out that \"the scope\r\nof history has gradually widened till it has come to include every\r\naspect of the life of humanity.\" Many of the social and economic\r\nsubjects of which the historian has now to treat are of an extremely\r\ncontroversial character. However high may be the ideal of truth, which\r\nwill be entertained, it would appear that the various forms in which the\r\nfacts of history may be stated, as also the conclusions to be drawn from\r\nthese facts, will tend to divergence rather than to uniformity of\r\ntreatment. It is not, therefore, probable that the partisan\r\nhistorian--or, at all events, the historian who will be accused of\r\npartisanship--will altogether disappear from literature. Neither, on the\r\nwhole, is his disappearance to be desired, for it would almost certainly\r\nconnote the composition of somewhat vapid and colourless histories.\r\n\r\nThe verdicts which Mr. Gooch passes on the historians whose writings he\r\nbriefly summarises are eminently judicious, though it cannot be expected\r\nthat in all cases they will command universal assent. In a work which\r\nranges over so wide a field it is scarcely possible that some slips\r\nshould not have occurred. We may indicate one of these, which it would\r\nbe as well to correct in the event of any future editions being\r\npublished. On p. 435 the authorship of _Fieramosca_ and _Nicolo dei\r\nLapi_, which were written by Azeglio, is erroneously attributed to\r\nCesare Balbo.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: _History and Historians of the Nineteenth Century_. By\r\nG.P. Gooch. London: Longmans and Co. 10s. 6d.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHE GREEK ANTHOLOGY[77]\r\n\r\n_\"The Spectator,\" May 10, 1913_\r\n\r\n\r\nShelley, himself a translator of one of the best known of the epigrams\r\nof the Anthology, has borne emphatic testimony to the difficulties of\r\ntranslation. \"It were as wise,\" he said, \"to cast a violet into a\r\ncrucible that you might discover the formal principle of its colour and\r\nodour, as seek to transfuse from one language into another the creations\r\nof a poet.\"\r\n\r\nThe task of rendering Greek into English verse is in some respects\r\nspecially difficult. In the first place, the translator has to deal with\r\na language remarkable for its unity and fluency, qualities which,\r\naccording to Curtius (_History of Greece_, i. 18), are the result of the\r\n\"delicately conceived law, according to which all Greek words must end\r\nin vowels, or such consonants as give rise to no harshness when\r\nfollowed by others, viz. _n_, _r_, and _s_.\" Then, again, the translator\r\nmust struggle with the difficulties arising from the fact that the\r\nGreeks regarded condensation in speech as a fine art. Demetrius, or\r\nwhoever was the author of _De Elocutione_, said: \"The first grace of\r\nstyle is that which results from compression.\" The use of an inflected\r\nlanguage of course enabled the Greeks to carry this art to a far higher\r\ndegree of perfection than can be attained by any modern Europeans. Jebb,\r\nfor instance, takes twelve words--\"Well hath he spoken for one who\r\ngiveth heed not to fall\"--to express a sentiment which Sophocles (_Œd.\r\nTyr._ 616) is able to compress into four--καλῶς ἔλεξεν εὐλαβουμένῳ\r\nπεσεῖν. Moreover, albeit under the stress of metrical and linguistic\r\nnecessity the translator must generally indulge in paraphrase, let him\r\nbeware lest in doing so he sacrifices that quality in which the Greeks\r\nexcelled, to wit, simplicity. Nietzsche said, with great truth, \"Die\r\nGriechen sind, wie das Genie, einfach; deshalb sind sie die\r\nunsterblichen Lehrer.\" Further, the translator has at times so to\r\nmanipulate his material as to incorporate into his verse epithets and\r\nfigures of speech of surpassing grace and expressiveness, which do not\r\nreadily admit of transfiguration into any modern language; such, for\r\ninstance, as the \"much-wooed white-armed Maiden Muse\" (πολυμνήστη\r\nλευκώλενε παρθένε Μοῦσα) of Empedocles; the \"long countless Time\"\r\n(μακρὸς κἀναρίθμητος Χρόνος), or \"babbling Echo\" (ἀθυρόστομος Ἀχώ) of\r\nSophocles; the \"son, the subject of many prayers\" (πολυεύχετος υἱός) and\r\ncountless other expressions of the Homeric Hymns; the \"blooming Love\r\nwith his pinions of gold\" (ὁ δ' ἀμφιθαλής Ἔρος χρυσόπτερος ἡνίας) of\r\nAristophanes; \"the eagle, messenger of wide-ruling Zeus, the lord of\r\nThunder\" (αἰετός, εὐρυάνακτος ἄγγελος Ζηνὸς ἐρισφαράγου) of Bacchylides;\r\nor mighty Pindar's \"snowy Etna nursing the whole year's length her\r\nfrozen snow\" (νιφόεσς' Αἴτνα πανετες χιόνος ὀξείας τιθήνα).\r\n\r\nIn no branch of Greek literature are these difficulties more conspicuous\r\nthan in the Anthology, yet it is the Anthology that has from time\r\nimmemorial notably attracted the attention of translators. It is indeed\r\ntrue that the compositions of Agathias, Palladas, Paulus Silentiarius,\r\nand the rest of the poetic tribe who \"like the dun nightingale\" were\r\n\"insatiate of song\" (οἷά τις ξουθὰ ἀκόρεστος βοᾶς ... ἀηδών), must,\r\ncomparatively speaking, rank low amongst the priceless legacies which\r\nGreece bequeathed to a grateful posterity. A considerable number of the\r\nwriters whose works are comprised in the Anthology lived during the\r\nAlexandrian age. The artificiality of French society before the French\r\nRevolution developed a taste for shallow versifying. Somewhat similar\r\nsymptoms characterised the decadent society of Alexandria, albeit there\r\nwere occasions when a nobler note was struck, as in the splendid hymn of\r\nCleanthes, written in the early part of the second century B.C.\r\nGenerally speaking, however, Professor Mahaffy's criticism of the\r\nliterature of this period (_Greek Life and Thought_, p. 264) holds good.\r\n\"We feel in most of these poems that it is no real lover languishing for\r\nhis mistress, but a pedant posing before a critical public. If ever poet\r\nwas consoled by his muse, it was he; he was far prouder if Alexandria\r\napplauded the grace of his epigram than if it whispered the success of\r\nhis suit.\" How have these manifest defects been condoned? Why is it\r\nthat, in spite of much that is artificial and commonplace, the poetry of\r\nthe Anthology still exercises, and will continue to exercise, an undying\r\ncharm alike over the student, the moralist, and the man of the world?\r\nThe reasons are not far to seek. In the first place, no productions of\r\nthe Greek genius conform more wholly to the Aristotelian canon that\r\npoetry should be an imitation of the universal. Few of the poems in the\r\nAnthology depict any ephemeral phase or fashion of opinion, like the\r\nEuphuism of the sixteenth century. All appeal to emotions which endure\r\nfor all time, and which, it has been aptly said, are the true raw\r\nmaterial of poetry. The patriot can still feel his blood stirred by the\r\nringing verse of Simonides. The moralist can ponder over the vanity of\r\nhuman wishes, which is portrayed in endless varieties of form, and\r\nwhich, even when the writer most exults in the worship of youth\r\n(πολυήρατος ἥβη) or extols the philosophy of Epicurus, is always tinged\r\nwith a shade of profound melancholy, inasmuch as every poet bids us bear\r\nin mind, to use the beautiful metaphor of Keats, that the hand of Joy is\r\n\"ever on his lips bidding adieu,\" and that the \"wave of death\"--the\r\nκοινὸν κῦμ' Αΐδα of Pindar--persistently dogs the steps of all mankind.\r\nThe curious in literature will find in the Anthology much apparent\r\nconfirmation of the saying of Terence that nothing is ever said that has\r\nnot been said before. He will note that not only did the gloomy Palladas\r\nsay that he came naked into the world, and that naked he will depart,\r\nbut that he forestalled Shakespeare in describing the world as a stage\r\n(σκηνὴ πᾶς ὁ βίος καὶ παίγνιον), whilst Philostratus, Meleager, and\r\nAgathias implored their respective mistresses to drink to them only with\r\ntheir eyes and to leave a kiss within the cup. The man of the world will\r\ngive Agathias credit for keen powers of observation when he notes that\r\nthe Greek poet said that gambling was a test of character (κύβος\r\nἀγγέλλει βένθος ἐχεφροσύης[78]), whilst if for a moment he would step\r\noutside the immediate choir of the recognised Anthologists, he may smile\r\nwhen he reads that Menander thought it all very well to \"know oneself,\"\r\nbut that it was in practice far more useful to know other people\r\n(χρησιμώτερον γὰρ ἦν τὸ γνῶθι τοὺς ἄλλουσ).\r\n\r\nThen, again, the pungent brevity of such of the poetry of the Anthology\r\nas is epigrammatic is highly attractive. Much has at times been said as\r\nto what constitutes an epigram, but the case for brevity has probably\r\nnever been better stated than by a witty Frenchwoman of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. Madame de Boufflers wrote:\r\n\r\n    Il faut dire en deux mots\r\n      Ce qu'on veut dire;\r\n    Les longs propos\r\n      Sont sots.\r\n\r\nIn this respect, indeed, French can probably compete more successfully\r\nthan any other modern language with Greek. Democritus (410 B.C.) wrote,\r\nὁ κόσμος σκηνή, ὁ βίος πάραδος· ἦλθες, εἶδες, ἀπῆλθες. The French\r\nversion of the same idea is in no way inferior to the Greek:\r\n\r\n    On entre, on crie,\r\n    Et c'est la vie!\r\n    On crie, on sort,\r\n    Et c'est la mort!\r\n\r\nLastly, although much of the sentiment expressed in the Anthology is\r\nartificial, and although the language is at times offensive to modern\r\nears, the writers almost invariably exhibit that leading quality of the\r\nGreek genius on which the late Professor Butcher was wont to insist so\r\nstrongly--its virile sanity.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons the literary world may cordially welcome a further\r\naddition to the abundant literature which already exists on the subject\r\nof the Anthology. The principle adopted by Dr. Grundy is unquestionably\r\nsound. He recognises that great Homer sometimes nods, that even men of\r\nreal poetic genius are not always at their best, and that mere\r\nversifiers can at times, by a happy inspiration, embody an idea in\r\nlanguage superior to the general level of their poetic compositions.\r\nEnglish literature of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries abounds\r\nin cases in point. Lovelace, Montrose, and even, it may almost be said,\r\nWither and Herrick, live mainly in public estimation owing to the\r\ncomposition of a small number of exquisitely felicitous verses which\r\nhave raised them for ever to thrones amongst the immortals. Dr. Grundy,\r\ntherefore, has very wisely ranged over the whole wide field of Anthology\r\ntranslators, and has culled a flower here and a flower there. His method\r\nin making his selections is as unimpeachable as his principle. He has\r\ndiscarded all predilections based on the authority of names or on other\r\nconsiderations, and has simply chosen those translations which he\r\nhimself likes best.\r\n\r\nDr. Grundy, in his preface, expresses a hope that he will be pardoned\r\nfor \"the human weakness\" of having in many cases preferred his own\r\ntranslations to those of others. That pardon will be readily extended to\r\nhim, for although in a brief review of this nature it is impossible to\r\nquote his compositions at any length, it is certainly true that some at\r\nleast of his translations are probably better than any that have yet\r\nbeen attempted. Dr. Grundy says in his preface that he \"has abided in\r\nmost instances as closely as possible to the literal translations of the\r\noriginals.\" That is the principle on which all, or nearly all,\r\ntranslators have proceeded, but the qualifying phrase--\"as closely as\r\npossible\"--has admitted of wide divergence in their practice. In some\r\ncases, indeed, it is possible to combine strict adherence to the\r\noriginal text with graceful language and harmonious metre in the\r\ntranslation, but in a large number of instances the translator has to\r\nsacrifice one language or the other. He has to choose between being\r\nblamed by the purist who will not admit of any expansion in the ideas of\r\nthe original writer, or being accused of turning the King's English to\r\nbase uses by the employment of doubtful rhythm or cacophonous\r\nexpressions. Is it necessary to decide between these two rival schools\r\nand to condemn one of them? Assuredly not. Both have their merits. An\r\ninstance in point is the exquisite \"Rosa Rosarum\" of Dionysius, which\r\nruns thus:\r\n\r\n    Ἡ τὰ ῥόδα, ῥοδόεσσαν ἔχεις χάριν· ἀλλὰ τί πωλεῖς,\r\n      σαυτήν, ἢ τὰ ῥόδα, ἠέ συναμφόθερα;\r\n\r\nMr. Pott, in his _Greek Love Songs and Epigrams_, adopted the triolet\r\nmetre, which is singularly suitable to the subject, in dealing with this\r\nepigram, and gracefully translated thus:\r\n\r\n    Which roses do you offer me,\r\n    Those on your cheeks, or those beside you?\r\n    Since both are passing fair to see,\r\n    Which roses do you offer me?\r\n    To give me both would you agree,\r\n    Or must I choose, and so divide you?\r\n    Which roses do you offer me,\r\n    Those on your cheeks or those beside you?\r\n\r\nHere the two lines of the original are expanded into eight lines in the\r\ntranslation, and some fresh matter is introduced. Dr. Grundy imposes\r\nmore severe limitations on his muse. His translation, which is more\r\nliteral, but at the same time singularly felicitous, is as follows:\r\n\r\n    Hail, thou who hast the roses, thou hast the rose's grace!\r\n    But sellest thou the roses, or e'en thine own fair face?\r\n\r\nAny one of literary taste will find it difficult to decide which of\r\nthese versions to prefer, and will impartially welcome both.\r\n\r\nIt cannot, however, be doubted that strict adherence to Dr. Grundy's\r\nprinciple occasionally leads to results which are open to criticism from\r\nthe point of view of English style. A case in point is his translation\r\nof Plato's epitaph on a shipwrecked sailor:\r\n\r\n    Ναυηγοῦ τάφος εἰμί· ὁ δ' ἀντίον ἐστὶ γεωργοῦ·\r\n      ὡς ἁλὶ καὶ γαίῃ ξυνὸς ὕπεστ' Ἀίδης.\r\n\r\nDr. Grundy's translation, which is as follows, adheres closely to the\r\noriginal text, but somewhat grates on the English ear:\r\n\r\n    A sailor's tomb am I; o'er there a yokel's tomb there be;\r\n    For Hades lies below the earth as well as 'neath the sea.\r\n\r\nAnother instance is the translation of the epigram of Nicarchus on The\r\nLifeboat, in which the inexorable necessities of finding a rhyme to\r\n\"e'en Almighty Zeus\" has compelled the translator to resort to the\r\ncolloquial and somewhat graceless phrase \"in fact, the very deuce.\"\r\n\r\nBut criticisms such as these may be levelled against well-nigh all\r\ntranslators. They merely constitute a reason for holding that Shelley\r\nwas not far wrong in the opinion quoted above. Few translators have,\r\nindeed, been able to work up to the standard of William Cory's\r\nwell-known version of Callimachus's epitaph on Heraclitus, which Dr.\r\nGrundy rightly remarks is \"one of the most beautiful in our language,\"\r\nor to Dr. Symonds's translation of the epitaph on Proté, which \"is\r\nperhaps the finest extant version in English of any of the verses from\r\nthe Anthology.\" But many have contributed in a minor degree to render\r\nthese exquisite products of the Greek genius available to English\r\nreaders, and amongst them Dr. Grundy may fairly claim to occupy a\r\ndistinguished place. He says in his preface, with great truth, that the\r\npoets of the Anthology are never wearisome. Neither is Dr. Grundy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: _Ancient Gems in Modern Settings._ By G.B. Grundy.

If, as is to be feared, it does not help much towards the\r\nimmediate solution of the various problems which are treated, it is,\r\nnone the less, a very interesting record of the mental processes\r\nundergone by an eminent politician, who combines in a high degree the\r\nqualities of a man of action and those of a political thinker. We are\r\npresented with the picture of a man of high intellectual gifts, great\r\nmoral courage, and unquestionable honesty of purpose, who has a gospel\r\nto preach to his fellow countrymen--the gospel of Imperialism, or, in\r\nother words, the methods which should be adopted to consolidate and to\r\nmaintain the integrity of the British Empire. In his missionary efforts\r\non behalf of his special creed Lord Milner has found that he has been\r\nwell-nigh throttled by the ligatures of the party system--a system which\r\nhe spurns and loathes, but from which he has found by experience that he\r\ncould by no means free himself. As a practical politician he had to\r\nrecognise that, in order to gain the ear of the public on the subjects\r\nfor which he cares, he was obliged to do some \"vigorous swashbuckling in\r\nthe field of party politics\" in connection with other subjects in which\r\nhe is relatively less interested. He resigned himself, albeit\r\nreluctantly, to his fate, holding apparently not only that the end\r\njustified the means, but also that without the adoption of those means\r\nthere could not be the smallest prospect of the end being attained. The\r\ndifficulty in which Lord Milner has found himself is probably felt more\r\nkeenly by those who, like himself, have been behind the scenes of\r\ngovernment, and have thus been able fully to realise the difficulties of\r\ndealing with public questions on their own merits to the exclusion of\r\nall considerations based on party advantages or disadvantages, than by\r\nothers who have had no such experience. Nevertheless, the dilemma must\r\nin one form or another have presented itself to every thinking man who\r\nis not wholly carried away by prejudice. Most thinking men, however,\r\nunless they are prepared to pass their political lives in a state of\r\ndreamy idealism, come rapidly to the conclusion that to seek for any\r\nthoroughly satisfactory practical solution of this dilemma is as\r\nfruitless as to search for the philosopher's stone. They see that the\r\nparty system is the natural outcome of the system of representative\r\ngovernment, that it of necessity connotes a certain amount of party\r\ndiscipline, and that if that discipline be altogether shattered,\r\npolitical chaos would ensue. They, therefore, join that party with\r\nwhich, on the whole, they are most in agreement, and they do so knowing\r\nfull well that they will almost certainly at times be associated with\r\nmeasures which do not fully command their sympathies. What is it that\r\nmakes such men, for instance, as Lord Morley and Mr. Arthur Balfour not\r\nmerely strong political partisans, but also stern party disciplinarians?\r\nIt would be absurd to suppose that they consider a monopoly of political\r\nwisdom to be possessed by the party to which each belongs, or that they\r\nfail to see that every public question presents at least two sides. The\r\ninference is that, recognising the necessity of association with others,\r\nthey are prepared to waive all minor objections in order to advance the\r\nmain lines of the policy to which each respectively adheres.\r\n\r\nThe plan which has always commended itself to those who see clearly the\r\nevils of the party system, but fail to realise the even greater evils to\r\nwhich its non-existence would open the door, has been to combine in one\r\nadministration a number of men possessed of sufficient patriotism and\r\ndisinterestedness to work together for the common good, in spite of the\r\nfact that they differ widely, if not on the objects to be attained, at\r\nall events on the methods of attaining them. Experience has shown that\r\nthis plan is wholly impracticable. It does not take sufficient account\r\nof the fact that, as the immortal Mr. Squeers or some other of Dickens's\r\ncharacters said, there is a great deal of human nature in man,[79] and\r\nthat one of man's most cherished characteristics--notably if he is an\r\nEnglishman--is combativeness. In the early days of the party system even\r\nso hardened and positive a parliamentarian as Walpole thought that\r\neffect might be given to some such project, but when it came to the\r\nactual formation of a hybrid Ministry, Mr. Grant Robertson, the\r\nhistorian of the Hanoverian period, says that it \"vanished into thin\r\nair,\" and that, as Pulteney remarked about the celebrated Sinking Fund\r\nplan, the \"proposal to make England patriotic, pure and independent of\r\nCrown and Ministerial corruption, ended in some little thing for curing\r\nthe itch.\" Neither have somewhat similar attempts which have been made\r\nsince Walpole's time succeeded in abating the rancour of party strife.\r\nMoreover, it cannot be said that the attempt to treat female suffrage as\r\na non-party question has so far yielded any very satisfactory or\r\nencouraging results.\r\n\r\nLord Milner, however, does not live in Utopia. He does not look forward\r\nto the possibility of abolishing the party system. \"It is not,\" he says,\r\n\"a new party that is wanted.\" But he thinks--and he is unquestionably\r\nright in thinking--\"that the number of men profoundly interested in\r\npublic affairs, and anxious to discharge their full duty of citizens who\r\nare in revolt against the rigidity and insincerity of our present party\r\nsystem, is very considerable and steadily increasing.\" He wishes people\r\nin this category to be organised with a view to encouraging a national\r\nas opposed to a party spirit, and he holds that \"with a little\r\norganisation they could play the umpire between the two parties and make\r\nthe unscrupulous pursuit of mere party advantage an unprofitable game.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea is not novel, but it is certainly statesmanlike. The general\r\nprinciple which Lord Milner advocates will probably commend itself to\r\nthousands of his countrymen, and most of all to those whose education\r\nand experience are a warrant for the value of their political opinions.\r\nBut how far is the scheme practicable? The answer to this question is\r\nthat there is one essential preliminary condition necessary to bring it\r\nwithin the domain of practical politics; that condition is that a\r\nsufficient number of leading politicians should be thoroughly imbued\r\nwith the virtue of compromise. They must erase the word \"thorough\" from\r\ntheir political vocabulary. Each must recognise that whilst, to use Lord\r\nMilner's expression, he himself holds firmly to a \"creed\" on some\r\nspecial question, he will have to co-operate with others who hold with\r\nequally sincere conviction to a more or less antagonistic creed, and\r\nthat this co-operation cannot be secured by mere assertion and still\r\nless by vituperation, but only by calm discussion and mutual\r\nconcessions. Marie Antoinette, who was very courageous and very unwise,\r\nsaid during the most acute crisis of the Revolution, \"Better to die than\r\nallow ourselves to be saved by Lafayette and the Constitutionalists.\"\r\nThat is an example of the party spirit _in extremis_, and when it is\r\nadopted it is that spirit which causes the shipwreck of many a scheme\r\nwhich might, with more moderation and conciliation, be brought safely\r\ninto port. In order to carry out Lord Milner's plan any such spirit must\r\nbe wholly cast aside. Politicians--and none more than many of those with\r\nwhom Lord Milner is associated--must act on the principle which\r\nShakespeare puts into the mouth of Henry V.:\r\n\r\n    There is some soul of goodness in things evil\r\n    Would men observingly distil it out.\r\n\r\nThey must be prepared to recognise that, whatever be their personal\r\nconvictions, there may be some \"soul of goodness\" in views diametrically\r\nopposed to their own, and, moreover, they must not be scared by what\r\nEmerson called that \"hobgoblin of little minds\"--the charge of\r\ninconsistency.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that just at present the omens are very favourable in\r\nthe direction of indicating any widespread prevalence amongst active\r\npoliticians of the spirit of compromise. The reception given to Lord\r\nCurzon's very reasonable proposal that army affairs should be treated as\r\na non-party question is apparently scouted by Radical politicians.\r\nNeither does there appear to be the least disposition to accept the\r\nstatesmanlike suggestion that in order to avoid the risk of civil war in\r\nUlster, with its almost inevitable consequence, viz. that the loyalty\r\nof the army will be strained to the utmost, the Home Rule Bill should\r\nnot be submitted to the King for his assent until after another general\r\nelection. On the other hand, the \"Die-hard\" spirit, which led to the\r\ndisastrous rejection of the Budget of 1909, and was with difficulty\r\nprevented from rejecting the Parliament Bill, is still prevalent amongst\r\nmany Unionists, whilst although a somewhat greater latitudinarian spirit\r\nprevails than heretofore, the influence of extreme Unionist politicians\r\nis still sufficiently powerful to prevent full acceptance of the fact\r\nthat the only sound and wise Conservative principle is to neglect minor\r\ndifferences of opinion and to rally together all who are generally\r\nfavourable to the Conservative cause.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it must be admitted that Lord Milner is asking a great deal of\r\nparty politicians. He points out, in connection with his special\r\n\"creed,\" that the object of Mr. Chamberlain's original proposal was\r\n\"undoubtedly laudable. It was prompted by motives of Imperial\r\npatriotism.\" There are probably few people who would be inclined to\r\nchallenge the accuracy of this statement. He alludes to the\r\nunquestionable fact that it is well for every community from time to\r\ntime to review the traditional foundations of its policy, and he holds\r\nthat, if the controversy which Mr. Chamberlain evoked \"had been\r\nconducted on anything like rational lines, the result, whether\r\nfavourable or unfavourable to the proposals themselves, might have been\r\nof great public advantage.\" All these fair hopes, Lord Milner thinks,\r\nwere wrecked by the spirit of party. \"The new issue raised by Mr.\r\nChamberlain was sucked into the vortex of our local party struggle.\"\r\nLord Milner, therefore, wishes to lift Imperialism out of the party bog\r\nand to treat the subject on broad national lines.\r\n\r\nHere, again, the proposal is undoubtedly statesmanlike, but is it\r\npracticable? There can, it is to be feared, be but one answer to that\r\nquestion. For the time being, at all events, Lord Milner's proposal is\r\nquite impracticable. Whatever be the merits or demerits of the proposals\r\ninitiated by Mr. Chamberlain, one thing appears tolerably certain, and\r\nthat is that so long as Tariff Reform and Imperial policy are intimately\r\nconnected together there is not, so far as can at present be judged, the\r\nmost remote chance of Imperialism emerging from the arena of party\r\nstrife. It is true, and is, moreover, a subject for national\r\ncongratulation, that there has been of late years a steady growth of\r\nImperialist ideas. The day is probably past for ever when Ministers,\r\nwhether Liberal or Conservative, could speak of the colonies as a\r\nburden, and look forward with equanimity, if not with actual pleasure,\r\nto their complete severance from the Mother country. Few, if any,\r\npronounced anti-Imperialists exist, but a wide difference of opinion\r\nprevails as to the method for giving effect to an Imperial policy. These\r\ndifferences do not depend solely, as is often erroneously supposed, on a\r\nrigid adherence by Free Traders to what are now called Cobdenite\r\nprinciples. There are many Free Traders who would be disposed to make a\r\nconsiderable sacrifice of their opinions on economic principles, if they\r\nthought that the policy proposed by Mr. Chamberlain would really achieve\r\nthe object he unquestionably had in view, viz. that of tightening the\r\nbonds between the Mother country and the colonies. But that is what they\r\ndeny. They rely mainly on a common ancestry, common traditions, a common\r\nlanguage, and a common religion to cement those bonds; and, moreover,\r\nthey hold, to quote the words of an able article published two years ago\r\nin the _Round Table_: \"The chief reason for the sentiment of Imperial\r\nunity is the conscious or unconscious belief of the people of the Empire\r\nin their own political system.... There is in the British Empire a unity\r\nwhich it is often difficult to discern amid the conflict of racial\r\nnationalities, provincial politics, and geographical differences. It is\r\na unity which is based upon the conviction amongst the British\r\nself-governing communities that the political system of the Empire is\r\nindispensable to their own progress, and that to allow it to collapse\r\nwould be fatal alike to their happiness and their self-respect.\" They\r\ntherefore demur to granting special economic concessions which--unless,\r\nindeed, a policy of perfect Free Trade throughout the Empire could be\r\nadopted--they think, whatever might be the immediate result, would\r\neventually cause endless friction and tend to weaken rather than\r\nstrengthen the Imperial connection.\r\n\r\nFurther, it is to be observed that whatever exacerbation has been caused\r\nby party exaggeration and misrepresentation, it is more than doubtful\r\nwhether Lord Milner's special accusation against the party system can be\r\nmade good, for it must be remembered that Mr. Chamberlain's original\r\nprogramme was strongly opposed by many who, on mere party grounds, were\r\nearnestly desirous to accord it a hearty welcome. Rather would it be\r\ntrue to say that, looking back on past events, it is amazing that any\r\none of political experience could have imagined for one moment that a\r\nproposal which touched the opinions and interests of almost every\r\nindividual in the United Kingdom, and which was wholly at variance with\r\nthe views heretofore held by Mr. Chamberlain himself, could have been\r\nkept outside the whirlpool of party politics. \"A great statesman,\" it\r\nhas been truly said, \"must have two qualities; the first is prudence,\r\nthe second imprudence.\" Cavour has often been held up as the example of\r\nan eminent man who combined, in his own person, these apparently\r\nparadoxical qualities. Accepting the aphorism as true, it has to be\r\napplied with the corollary that the main point is to know when to allow\r\nimprudence to predominate over prudence. It is difficult to resist the\r\nconclusion that when Mr. Chamberlain launched his programme, which Lord\r\nMilner admits \"burst like a bombshell in the camp of his friends,\" he\r\noverweighted the balance on the imprudent side. The heat with which the\r\ncontroversy has been conducted, and which Lord Milner very rightly\r\ndeplores, must be attributed mainly to this cause rather than to any\r\ninherent and, to a great extent, unavoidable defects in the party\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all these difficulties and objections, Lord Milner and\r\nthose who hold with him may take heart of grace in so far as their\r\ncampaign against the extravagances of the party system is concerned. It\r\nmay well be that no special organisation will enable the non-party\r\npartisans to occupy the position of umpires, but the steady pressure of\r\npublic opinion and the stern exposure of the abuses of the party system\r\nwill probably in time mitigate existing evils, and will possibly in\r\nsome degree purge other issues, besides those connected with foreign\r\naffairs, from the rancour of the party spirit. As a contribution to this\r\nend Lord Milner's utterances are to be heartily welcomed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: This statement is incorrect. The saying quoted above\r\noccurs in Mr. J.R. Lowell's address at the memorial meeting to Dean\r\nStanley, Dec. 13, 1881. He introduces it as \"a proverbial phrase which\r\nwe have in America and which, I believe, we carried from England.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH IN ALGERIA[80]\r\n\r\n_\"The Spectator,\" May 31, 1913_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the very interesting account which Mrs. Devereux Roy has given of the\r\npresent condition of Algeria, she says that France \"is now about to\r\nembark upon a radical change of policy in regard to her African\r\ncolonies.\" If it be thought presumptuous for a foreigner who has no\r\nlocal knowledge of Algerian affairs to make certain suggestions as to\r\nthe direction which those changes might profitably assume, an apology\r\nmust be found in Mrs. Roy's very true remark that England \"can no more\r\nafford to be indifferent to the relations of France with her Moslem\r\nsubjects than she can disregard the trend of our policy in Egypt and\r\nIndia.\" It is, indeed, manifest that somewhat drastic reforms of a\r\nliberal character will have to be undertaken in Algeria. The French\r\nGovernment have adopted the only policy which is worthy of a civilised\r\nnation. They have educated the Algerians, albeit Mrs. Roy tells us that\r\ngrants for educational purposes have been doled out \"with a very sparing\r\nhand.\" They must bear the consequences of the generous policy which they\r\nhave pursued. They must recognise, as Macaulay said years ago, that it\r\nis impossible to impart knowledge without stimulating ambition. Reforms\r\nare, therefore, imposed by the necessities of the situation.\r\n\r\nThese reforms may be classified under three heads, namely, fiscal,\r\njudicial, and political. The order in which changes under each head\r\nshould be undertaken would appear to be a matter of vital importance. If\r\nresponsible French statesmen make a mistake in this matter--if, to use\r\nthe language of proverbial philosophy, they put the cart before the\r\nhorse--they may not improbably lay the seeds of very great trouble for\r\ntheir countrymen in the future. Prince Bismarck once said: \"Mistakes\r\ncommitted in statesmanship are not always punished at once, but they\r\nalways do harm in the end. The logic of history is a more exact and a\r\nmore exacting accountant than is the strictest national auditing\r\ndepartment.\"\r\n\r\nIt should never be forgotten that, however much local circumstances may\r\ndiffer, there are certain broad features which always exist wherever\r\nthe European--be he French, English, German, or of any other\r\nnationality--is brought in contact with the Oriental--be he Algerian,\r\nIndian, or Egyptian. When the former once steps outside the influence\r\nacquired by the power of the sword, and seeks for any common ground of\r\nunderstanding with the subject race, he finds that he is, by the\r\nelementary facts of the case, debarred from using all those moral\r\ninfluences which, in more homogeneous countries, bind society together.\r\nThese are a common religion, a common language, common traditions,\r\nand--save in very rare instances--intermarriage and really intimate\r\nsocial relations. What therefore remains? Practically nothing but the\r\nbond of material interest, tempered by as much sympathy as it is\r\npossible in the difficult circumstances of the case to bring into play.\r\nBut on this poor material--for it must be admitted that it is poor\r\nmaterial--experience has shown that a wise statesmanship can build a\r\npolitical edifice, not indeed on such assured foundations as prevail in\r\nmore homogeneous societies, but nevertheless of a character which will\r\ngive some solid guarantees of stability, and which will, in any case,\r\nminimise the risk that the sword, which the European would fain leave in\r\nthe scabbard, shall be constantly flaunted before the eyes both of the\r\nsubject and the governing races, the latter of whom, on grounds alike\r\nof policy and humanity, deprecate its use save in cases of extreme\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\nIn the long course of our history many mistakes have been made in\r\ndealing with subject races, and the line of conduct pursued at various\r\ntimes has often been very erratic. Nevertheless, it would be true to say\r\nthat, broadly speaking, British policy has been persistently directed\r\ntowards an endeavour to strengthen political bonds through the medium of\r\nattention to material interests. The recent history of Egypt is a case\r\nin point.\r\n\r\nNo one who was well acquainted with the facts could at any time have\r\nthought that it would be possible to create in the minds of the\r\nEgyptians a feeling of devotion towards England which might in some\r\ndegree take the place of patriotism. Neither, in spite of the relatively\r\nhigher degree of social elasticity possessed by the French, is it at all\r\nprobable that any such feeling towards France will be created in\r\nAlgeria. But it was thought that by careful attention to the material\r\ninterests of the people it might eventually be possible to bring into\r\nexistence a conservative class who, albeit animated by no great love for\r\ntheir foreign rulers, would be sufficiently contented to prevent their\r\nbecoming easily the prey either of the Nationalist demagogue, who was\r\nsure sooner or later to spring into existence, or that of some barbarous\r\nreligious fanatic, such as the Mahdi, or, finally, that of some wily\r\npolitician, such as the Sultan Abdul Hamid who would, for his own\r\npurposes, fan the flame of religious and racial hatred. For many years\r\nafter the British occupation of Egypt began, the efforts of the British\r\nadministrators in that country were unceasingly directed towards the\r\nattainment of that object. The methods adopted, which it should be\r\nobserved were in the main carried out before any large sums were spent\r\non education, were the relief of taxation, the abolition of fiscal\r\ninequality and of the _corvée_, the improvement of irrigation, and last,\r\nbut not least, a variety of measures having for their object the\r\nmaintenance of a peasant proprietary class. The results which have been\r\nattained fully justify the adoption of this policy, which has probably\r\nnever been fully understood on the Continent of Europe, even if--which\r\nis very doubtful--it has been understood in England. What, in fact, has\r\nhappened in Egypt? Nationalists have enjoyed an excess of licence in a\r\nfree press. The Sultan has preached pan-Islamism. The usual Oriental\r\nintrigue has been rife. British politicians and a section of the British\r\npress, being very imperfectly informed as to the situation, have\r\noccasionally dealt with Egyptian affairs in a manner which, to say the\r\nleast, was indiscreet. But all has been of no avail. In spite of some\r\noutward appearances to the contrary, the whole Nationalist movement in\r\nEgypt has been a mere splutter on the surface. It never extended deep\r\ndown in the social ranks. More than this. When a very well-intentioned\r\nbut rather rash attempt was made to advance too rapidly in a liberal\r\ndirection, the inevitable reaction, which was to have been foreseen,\r\ntook place. Not merely Europeans but also Egyptians cried out loudly for\r\na halt, and, with the appointment of Lord Kitchener, they got what they\r\nwanted. The case would have been very different if the Nationalist, the\r\nreligious fanatic, or the scheming politician, in dealing with some\r\ncontroversial point or incident of ephemeral interest, had been able to\r\nappeal to a mass of deep-seated discontent due to general causes and to\r\nthe existence of substantial grievances. In that case the Nationalist\r\nmovement would have been less artificial. It would have extended not\r\nmerely to the surface but to the core of society. It would have\r\npossessed a real rather than, as has been shown to be the case, a\r\nspurious vitality. The recent history of Egypt, therefore, is merely an\r\nillustration of the general lesson taught by universal history. That\r\nlesson is that the best, and indeed the only, way to combat\r\nsuccessfully the proceedings of the demagogue or the agitator is to\r\nlimit his field of action by the removal of any real grievances which,\r\nif still existent, he would be able to use as a lever to awaken the\r\nblind wrath of Demos.\r\n\r\nHow far can principles somewhat analogous to these be applied in\r\nAlgeria?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is abundantly clear that, from many points of\r\nview, the French Government have successfully carried out the policy of\r\nministering to the material wants of the native population. Public works\r\nof great utility have been constructed. Means of locomotion have been\r\nimproved. Modern agricultural methods have been introduced. Famine has\r\nbeen rendered impossible. Mutual benefit societies have been\r\nestablished. The creation of economic habits has been encouraged. In all\r\nthese matters the French have certainly nothing to learn from us.\r\nPossibly, indeed, we may have something to learn from them.\r\nNevertheless, when it is asked whether the French Government is likely\r\nto reap the political fruits which it might have been hoped would be the\r\nresult of their efforts, whether they are in a fair way towards creating\r\na conservative spirit which would be adverse to any radical change, and\r\nwhether, in reliance on that spirit, they are in a position to move\r\nboldly forward in the direction of that liberal reform, the demand for\r\nwhich has naturally sprung into existence from their educational policy,\r\nit is at once clear that they are heavily weighted by the policy\r\noriginated some seventy years ago by Marshal Bugeaud, under which the\r\ninterests of the native population were made subservient to those of the\r\ncolonists, numbering about three-quarters of a million, of whom, Mrs.\r\nRoy tells us, less than one-half are of French origin. It may have been\r\nwise and necessary to initiate that policy. It may be wise and necessary\r\nto continue it with certain modifications. But it is obvious that the\r\nadoption of Marshal Bugeaud's plan has necessarily led to the creation\r\nof substantial grievances, which are important alike from the point of\r\nview of sentiment and from that of material interests. It appears now\r\nthat there is some probability that this policy will be modified in at\r\nleast one very important respect, namely, by the removal of the fiscal\r\ninequality which at present exists between the natives and the\r\ncolonists. The former are at present heavily taxed; the latter pay\r\nrelatively very little. It may be suggested that it would be worth the\r\nwhile of the French Government to consider whether this change should\r\nnot occupy the first place in the programme of reform. The present\r\nsystem is obviously indefensible on general grounds, whilst its\r\ncontinuance, until its abolition results from the strong native\r\npressure which will certainly ensue after the adoption of any drastic\r\nmeasure of political reform, would appear to be undesirable. It would\r\nprobably be wise and statesmanlike not to await this pressure, but to\r\nlet the concession be the spontaneous act of the French Government and\r\nnation rather than give the appearance of its having been wrung\r\nreluctantly from France by the insistence of the native population and\r\nits representatives.\r\n\r\nNext, there is the question of judicial reform. Mrs. Roy tells us that,\r\nunder what is called the _Code de l'Indigénat_, \"a native can be\r\narrested and imprisoned practically without trial at the will of the\r\n_administrateur_ for his district.\" It would require full local\r\nknowledge to treat this question adequately, but it would obviously be\r\ndesirable that the French Government should go as far as possible in the\r\ndirection of providing that all judicial matters should be settled by\r\njudicial officers who would be independent of the executive and, for the\r\nmost part, irremovable. Some local friction between the executive and\r\nthe judicial authorities is probably to be expected. That cannot be\r\nhelped. It might perhaps be mitigated by a very careful choice of the\r\nofficials in each case.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, there is the question of political reform. M.\r\nPhilippe Millet, who has published an interesting article on this\r\nsubject in the April number of _The Nineteenth Century_, is of course\r\nquite right in saying that political reform is the \"key to every other\r\nchange.\" Once give the natives of Algeria effective political strength,\r\nand the reforms will be forced upon the Government. But, as has been\r\nalready stated, it would perhaps be wiser and more statesmanlike that\r\nthese changes should be conceded spontaneously by the French Government,\r\nand that then, after a reasonable interval, the bulk of the political\r\nreforms should follow.\r\n\r\nA distinction, however, has to be made between the various\r\nrepresentative institutions which already exist. The _Conseil Supérieur_\r\nand the _Délégations Financières_ have very extensive powers, including\r\nthat of rejecting or modifying the Budget. At present these bodies may\r\nbe said, for all practical purposes, to be merely representative of the\r\ncolonists. It would certainly appear wise eventually to allow the\r\nnatives both a larger numerical strength on the _Conseil_ and on the\r\n_Délégations_, and also, by rearranging the franchise, to endeavour to\r\nsecure a more real representation of native interests. It must, however,\r\nbe borne in mind that the difficulties of securing any real\r\nrepresentation of the best interests in the country will almost\r\ncertainly be very great, if not altogether insuperable. In all\r\nprobability the loquacious, semi-educated native, who has in him the\r\nmakings of an agitator, will, under any system, naturally float to the\r\ntop, whilst the really representative man will sink to the bottom. It\r\nwould perhaps, therefore, be as well not to move in too great a hurry in\r\nthis matter, and, when any move is made, that the advance should be of a\r\nvery cautious and tentative nature.\r\n\r\nThe _Conseils Généraux_, which are provincial and municipal bodies,\r\nstand on a very different footing. Here it may be safe to move forward\r\nin the path of reform with greater boldness and with less delay. But\r\nwhatever is done it will probably be found that real progress in the\r\ndirection of self-government will depend more on the attitude of the\r\nFrench officials who are associated with the Councils than on any system\r\nwhich can be devised on paper. It may be assumed that the French\r\nofficials in Algeria present the usual characteristics of their class,\r\nthat is to say, that they are courageous, intelligent, zealous, and\r\nthoroughly honest. Also it may probably be assumed that they are\r\nsomewhat inelastic, somewhat unduly wedded to bureaucratic ideas, and\r\nmore especially that they are possessed with the very natural idea that\r\nthe main end and object of their lives is to secure the efficiency of\r\nthe administration. Now if self-government is to be a success, they will\r\nhave to modify to some extent their ideas as to the supreme necessity of\r\nefficiency. That is to say, they will have to recognise that it is\r\npolitically wiser to put up with an imperfect reform carried with native\r\nconsent, rather than to insist on some more perfect measure executed in\r\nthe teeth of strong--albeit often unreasonable--native opposition.\r\nEnglish experience has shown that this is a very hard lesson for\r\nofficials to learn. Nevertheless, the task of inculcating general\r\nprinciples of this nature is not altogether impossible. It depends\r\nmainly on the impulse which is given from above. To entrust the\r\nexecution of a policy of reform in Algeria to a man of\r\nultra-bureaucratic tendencies, who is hostile to reform of any kind,\r\nwould, of course, be to court failure. On the other hand, to select an\r\nextreme radical visionary, who will probably not recognise the\r\ndifference between East and West, would be scarcely less disastrous.\r\nWhat, in fact, is required is a man of somewhat exceptional qualities.\r\nHe must be strong--that is to say, he must impress the natives with the\r\nconviction that, albeit an advocate of liberal ideas, he is firmly\r\nresolved to consent to nothing which is likely to be detrimental to the\r\ntrue interests of France. He must also be sufficiently strong to keep\r\nhis own officials in hand and to make them conform to his policy, whilst\r\nat the same time he must be sufficiently tactful to win their confidence\r\nand to prevent their being banded together against him. The latter is a\r\npoint of very special importance, for in a country like Algeria no\r\ngovernment, however powerful, will be able to carry out a really\r\nbeneficial programme of reform if the organised strength of the\r\nbureaucracy--backed up, as would probably be the case, by the whole of\r\nthe European unofficial community--is thrown into bitter and\r\nirreconcilable opposition. The task, it may be repeated, is a difficult\r\none. Nevertheless, amongst the many men of very high ability in the\r\nFrench service there must assuredly be some who would be able to\r\nundertake it with a fair chance of success.\r\n\r\nOne further remark on this very interesting subject may be made. M.\r\nMillet, in the article to which allusion has already been made, says,\r\n\"The Algerian natives will look more and more to France as their natural\r\nprotector against the colonists.\" It will, it is to be hoped, not be\r\nthought over-presumptuous to sound a note of warning against trusting\r\ntoo much to this argument. That for the present the natives should look\r\nto France rather than to the colonists is natural enough. It is\r\nmanifestly their interest to do so. But it may be doubted whether they\r\nwill be \"more and more\" inspired by such sentiments as time goes on.\r\nThere is an Arabic proverb to the effect that \"all Christians are of one\r\ntribe.\" That is the spirit which in reality inspires the whole Moslem\r\nworld. It is illustrated by the author of that very remarkable work,\r\n_Turkey in Europe_, in an amusing apologue. Let once some\r\nsemi-religious, semi-patriotic leader arise, who will play skilfully on\r\nthe passions of the masses, and it will be somewhat surprising if the\r\ndistinction which now exists will long survive. All Frenchmen, those in\r\nFrance equally with those in Algeria, will then, it may confidently be\r\nexpected, be speedily confounded in one general anathema.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: _Aspects of Algeria_.

Lord Chesterfield, and at a\r\nmuch earlier period Marshal Vauban, foretold the French Revolution,\r\nwhilst the impending ruin of the Ottoman Empire has formed the theme of\r\nnumerous prophecies made by close observers of contemporaneous events\r\nfrom the days of Horace Walpole downwards. \"It is of no use,\" Napoleon\r\nwrote to the Directory, \"to try to maintain the Turkish Empire; we shall\r\nwitness its fall in our time.\" During the War of Greek Independence the\r\nDuke of Wellington believed that the end of Turkey was at hand. Where\r\nthe prophets have for the most part failed is not so much in making a\r\nmistaken estimate of the effects likely to be produced by the causes\r\nwhich they saw were acting on the body politic, as in not allowing\r\nsufficient time for the operation of those causes. Political evolution\r\nin its early stages is generally very slow. It is only after long\r\ninternal travail that it moves with vertiginous rapidity. De Tocqueville\r\ncast a remarkably accurate horoscope of the course which would be run by\r\nthe Second Empire, but it took some seventeen years to bring about\r\nresults which he thought would be accomplished in a much shorter period.\r\nIt has been reserved for the present generation to witness the\r\nfulfilment of prophecy in the case of European Turkey. The blindness\r\ndisplayed by Turkish statesmen to the lessons taught by history, their\r\ncomplete sterility in the domain of political thought, and their\r\ninability to adapt themselves and the institutions of their country to\r\nthe growing requirements of the age, might almost lead an historical\r\nstudent to suppose that they were bent on committing political suicide.\r\nThe combined diplomatists of Europe, Lord Salisbury sorrowfully remarked\r\nin 1877, \"all tried to save Turkey,\" but she scorned salvation and\r\npersisted in a course of action which could lead to but one result. That\r\nresult has now been attained. The dismemberment of European Turkey,\r\nbegun so long ago as the Peace of Karlovitz in 1699, is now almost\r\ncomplete. \"Modern history,\" Lord Acton said, \"begins under the stress of\r\nthe Ottoman conquest.\" Whatever troubles the future may have in store,\r\nEurope has at last thrown off the Ottoman incubus. A new chapter in\r\nmodern history has thus been opened. Henceforth, if Ottoman power is to\r\nsurvive at all, it must be in Asia, albeit the conflicting jealousies of\r\nthe European Powers allow for the time being the maintenance of an\r\nAsiatic outpost on European soil.\r\n\r\nIt is as yet too early to expect any complete or philosophic account of\r\nthis stupendous occurrence, which the future historian will rank with\r\nthe unification first of Italy and later of Germany, as one of the most\r\nepoch-making events of the later nineteenth and early twentieth\r\ncenturies. Notably, there are two subjects which require much further\r\nelucidation before the final verdict of contemporaries or posterity can\r\nbe passed upon them. In the first place, the causes which have led to\r\nthe military humiliation of a race which, whatever may be its defects,\r\nhas been noted in history for its martial virility, require to be\r\ndifferentiated. Was the collapse of the Turkish army due merely to\r\nincapacity and mismanagement on the part of the commanders, aided by\r\nthe corruption which has eaten like a canker into the whole Ottoman\r\nsystem of government and administration? Or must the causes be sought\r\ndeeper, and, if so, was it the palsy of an unbridled and malevolent\r\ndespotism which in itself produced the result, or did the sudden\r\ndownfall of the despot, by the removal of a time-honoured, if unworthy,\r\nsymbol of government, abstract the corner-stone from the tottering\r\npolitical edifice, and thus, by disarranging the whole administrative\r\ngear of the Empire at a critical moment, render the catastrophe\r\ninevitable? Further information is required before a matured opinion on\r\nthis point, which possesses more than a mere academic importance, can be\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another subject which, if only from a biographical point of\r\nview, is of great interest. Two untoward circumstances have caused\r\nTurkish domination in Europe to survive, and to resist the pressure of\r\nthe civilisation by which it was surrounded, but which seemed at one\r\ntime doomed to thunder ineffectually at its gates. One was excessive\r\njealousy--in Solomon's words, \"as cruel as the grave\"--amongst European\r\nStates, which would not permit of any political advantage being gained\r\nby a rival nation. The other, and, as subsequent events proved, more\r\npotent consideration, was the fratricidal jealousy which the\r\npopulations of the Balkan Peninsula mutually entertained towards each\r\nother. The maintenance and encouragement of mutual suspicions was, in\r\neither case, sedulously fostered by Turkish Sultans, the last of whom,\r\nmore especially, acted throughout his inglorious career in the firm\r\nbelief that mere mediaeval diplomatic trickery could be made to take the\r\nplace of statesmanship. He must have chuckled when he joyously put his\r\nhand to the firman creating a Bulgarian Exarch, who was forthwith\r\nexcommunicated by the Greek Patriarch, with the result, as Mr. Miller\r\ntells us, that \"peasants killed each other in the name of contending\r\necclesiastical establishments.\"\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the last century the poet Rhigas, who was to Greece\r\nwhat Arndt was to Germany and Rouget de Lisle to Revolutionary France,\r\nappealed to all Balkan Christians to rise on behalf of the liberties of\r\nGreece. But the hour had not yet come for any such unity to be cemented.\r\nAt that time, and for many years afterwards, Europe was scarcely\r\nconscious of the fact that there existed \"a long-forgotten, silent\r\nnationality\" which, after a lapse of nearly five centuries, would again\r\nspring into existence and bear a leading part in the liberation of the\r\nBalkan populations. But the rise of Bulgaria, far from bringing unity in\r\nits wake, appeared at first only to exacerbate not merely the mercurial\r\nGreek, proud of the intellectual and political primacy which he had\r\nheretofore enjoyed, but also the brother Slav, with whom differences\r\narose which necessitated an appeal to the arbitrament of arms.\r\n\r\nAlthough the thunder of the guns of Kirk Kilisse and Lüle Burgas\r\nproclaimed to Europe, in the words of the English Prime Minister, that\r\n\"the map of Eastern Europe had to be recast,\" it is none the less true\r\nthat the cause of the Turk was doomed from the moment when Balkan\r\ndiscord ceased, and when the Greek, the Bulgarian, the Serb, and the\r\nMontenegrin agreed to sink their differences and to act together against\r\nthe common enemy. Who was it who accomplished this miracle? Mr. Miller\r\nsays, \"the authorship of this marvellous work, hitherto the despair of\r\nstatesmen, is uncertain, but it has been ascribed chiefly to M.\r\nVenezélos.\" All, therefore, that can now be said is that it was the\r\nbrain, or possibly brains, of some master-workers which gave liberty to\r\nthe Balkan populations as surely as it was the brain of Cavour which\r\nunited Italy.[82]\r\n\r\nAlthough these and possibly other points will, without doubt, eventually\r\nreceive more ample treatment at the hands of some future historian, Mr.\r\nMiller has performed a most useful service in affording a guide by the\r\naid of which the historical student can find his way through the\r\nlabyrinthine maze of Balkan politics. He begins his story about the time\r\nwhen Napoleon had appeared like a comet in the political firmament, and\r\nby his erratic movements had caused all the statesmen of Europe to\r\ndiverge temporarily from their normal and conventional orbits, one\r\nresult being that the British Admiral Duckworth wandered in a somewhat\r\naimless fashion through the Dardanelles to Constantinople, and had very\r\nlittle idea of what to do when he got there. Mr. Miller reminds us of\r\nevents of great importance in their day, but now almost wholly\r\nforgotten: of how the ancient Republic of Ragusa, which had existed for\r\neleven centuries and which had earned the title of the \"South Slavonic\r\nAthens,\" was crushed out of existence under the iron heel of Marmont,\r\nwho forthwith proceeded to make some good roads and to vaccinate the\r\nDalmatians; of how Napoleon tried to partition the Balkans, but found,\r\nwith all his political and administrative genius, that he was face to\r\nface with an \"insoluble problem\"; of how that rough man of genius,\r\nMahmoud II., hanged the Greek Patriarch from the gate of his palace, but\r\nbetween the interludes of massacres and executions, brought his \"energy\r\nand indomitable force of will\" to bear on the introduction of reforms;\r\nof how the Venetian Count Capo d'Istria, who was eventually\r\nassassinated, produced a local revolt by a well-intentioned attempt to\r\namend the primitive ethics of the Mainote Greeks--a tale which is not\r\nwithout its warning if ever the time comes for dealing with a cognate\r\nquestion amongst the wild tribes of Albania; and of how, amidst the\r\never-shifting vicissitudes of Eastern politics, the Tsar of Russia, who\r\nhad heretofore posed as the \"protector\" of Roumans and Serbs against\r\ntheir sovereign, sent his fleet to the Bosphorus in 1833 in order to\r\n\"protect\" the sovereign against his rebellious vassal, Mehemet Ali, and\r\nexacted a reward for his services in the shape of the leonine\r\narrangement signed at Hunkiar-Iskelesi. And so Mr. Miller carries us on\r\nfrom massacre to massacre, from murder to murder, and from one\r\nbewildering treaty to another, all of which, however, present this\r\nfeature of uniformity, that the Turk, signing of his own free will, but\r\nwith an unwilling mind--ἑκὼν ἀέκοντί γε θυμῷ--made on each occasion\r\neither some new concession to the ever-rising tide of Christian demand,\r\nor ratified the loss of a province which had been forcibly torn from his\r\nflank. Finally, we get to the period when the tragedy connected with the\r\nname of Queen Draga acted like an electric shock on Europe, and when\r\nthe accession of King Peter, \"who had translated Mill _On Liberty_,\" to\r\nthe blood-stained Servian throne, revealed to an astonished world that\r\nthe processes of Byzantinism survived to the present day. Five years\r\nlater followed the assumption by Prince Ferdinand of the title of \"Tsar\r\nof the Bulgarians,\" and it then only required the occurrence of some\r\nopportunity and the appearance on the scene of some Balkan Cavour to\r\nbring the struggle of centuries to the final issue of a death-grapple\r\nbetween the followers of aggressive Christianity and those of stagnant\r\nIslamism.\r\n\r\nThe whole tale is at once dramatic and dreary, dramatic because it is\r\noccasionally illumined by acts of real heroism, such as the gallant\r\ndefence of Plevna by Ghazi Osman, a graphic account of which was written\r\nby an adventurous young Englishman (Mr. W.V. Herbert) who served in the\r\nTurkish army, or again as the conduct of the Cretan Abbot Máneses who,\r\nin 1866, rather than surrender to the Turks, \"put a match to the\r\npowder-magazine, thus uniting defenders and assailants in one common\r\nhecatomb.\" It is dreary because the mind turns with horror and disgust\r\nfrom the endless record of government by massacre, in which, it is to be\r\nobserved, the crime of bloodguiltiness can by no means be laid\r\nexclusively at the door of the dominant race, whilst Mr. Miller's\r\nsombre but perfectly true remark that \"assassination or abdication,\r\nexecution or exile, has been the normal fate of Balkan rulers,\" throws a\r\nlurid light on the whole state of Balkan society.\r\n\r\nBut how does the work of diplomacy, and especially of British diplomacy,\r\nstand revealed by the light of the history of the past century? The\r\npoint is one of importance, all the more so because there is a tendency\r\non the part of some British politicians to mistrust diplomatists, to\r\nthink that, either from incapacity or design, they serve as agents to\r\nstimulate war rather than as peace-makers, and to hold that a more\r\nminute interference by the House of Commons in the details of diplomatic\r\nnegotiations would be useful and beneficial. It would be impossible\r\nwithin the limits of an ordinary newspaper article to deal adequately\r\nwith this question. This much, however, may be said--that, even taking\r\nthe most unfavourable view of the results achieved by diplomacy, there\r\nis nothing whatever in Mr. Miller's history to engender the belief that\r\nbetter results would have been obtained by shifting the responsibility\r\nto a greater degree from the shoulders of the executive to those of\r\nParliament. The evidence indeed rather points to an opposite conclusion.\r\nFor instance, Mr. Miller informs us that inopportune action taken in\r\nEngland was one of the causes which contributed to the outbreak of\r\nhostilities between Greece and Turkey in 1897. \"An address from a\r\nhundred British members of Parliament encouraged the masses, ignorant of\r\nthe true condition of British politics, to count upon the help of Great\r\nBritain.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, however, quite true that a moralist, if he were so minded, might\r\nin Mr. Miller's pages find abundant material for a series of homilies on\r\nthe vanity of human wishes, and especially of diplomatic human wishes.\r\nBut would he on that account be right in pronouncing a wholesale\r\ncondemnation of diplomacy? Assuredly not. Rather, the conclusion to be\r\ndrawn from a review of past history is that a small number of very\r\nwell-informed and experienced diplomatists showed remarkable foresight\r\nin perceiving the future drift of events. So early as 1837 Lord\r\nPalmerston supported Milosh Obrenovitch II., the ruler of Servia,\r\nagainst Turkey, as he had \"come to the conclusion that to strengthen the\r\nsmall Christian States of the Near East was the true policy of both\r\nTurkey and Great Britain.\" Similar views were held at a later period by\r\nSir William White, and were eventually adopted by the Government of Lord\r\nBeaconsfield. An equal amount of foresight was displayed by some Russian\r\ndiplomatists. In Lord Morley's _Life of Gladstone_ (vol. i. p. 479) a\r\nvery remarkable letter is given, which was addressed to the Emperor\r\nNicholas by Baron Brunnow, just before the outbreak of the Crimean War,\r\nin which he advocated peace on the ground that \"war would not turn to\r\nRussian advantage.... The Ottoman Empire may be transformed into\r\nindependent States, which for us will only become either burdensome\r\nclients or hostile neighbours.\" It may be that, as is now very generally\r\nthought, the Crimean War was a mistake, and that, in the classic words\r\nof Lord Salisbury, we \"put our money on the wrong horse.\" But it is none\r\nthe less true that had it not been for the Crimean War and the policy\r\nsubsequently adopted by Lord Beaconsfield's government, the independence\r\nof the Balkan States would never have been achieved, and the Russians\r\nwould now be in possession of Constantinople. It is quite permissible to\r\nargue that, had they been left unopposed, British interests would not\r\nhave suffered; but even supposing this very debatable proposition to be\r\ntrue, it must be regarded, from an historical point of view, as at best\r\nan _ex post facto_ argument. British diplomacy has to represent British\r\npublic opinion, and during almost the whole period of which Mr. Miller's\r\nhistory treats, a cardinal article of British political faith was that,\r\nin the interests of Great Britain, Constantinople should not be allowed\r\nto fall into Russian hands. The occupation of Egypt in 1882 without\r\ndoubt introduced a new and very important element into the discussion.\r\nThe most serious as also the least excusable mistake in British\r\nNear-Eastern policy of recent years has been the occupation of Cyprus,\r\nwhich burthened us with a perfectly useless possession, and inflicted a\r\nserious blow on our prestige. Sir Edward Grey's recent diplomatic\r\nsuccess is in a large measure due to the fact that all the Powers\r\nconcerned were convinced of British disinterestedness.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: _The Ottoman Empire_, 1801-1913.

It was a time when a learned\r\ndivine, writing in the _Church and State Gazette_, had proved entirely\r\nto his own satisfaction, and apparently also to that of Lady Shelley,\r\nthat a \"remarkable fulfilment of that hitherto incomprehensible prophecy\r\nin the Revelations\" had taken place, inasmuch as Napoleon Bonaparte was\r\nmost assuredly \"the seventh head of the Beast.\" It was a time when\r\nLondoners rode in the Green Park instead of Rotten Row, and when, in\r\nspite of the admiration expressed for the talents of that rising young\r\npolitician, Mr. Robert Peel, it was impossible to deny that \"his birth\r\nran strongly against him\"--a consideration which elicited from Lady\r\nShelley the profound remark that it is \"strange to search into the\r\nrecesses of the human mind.\"\r\n\r\nLady Shelley herself seems to have been rather a _femme incomprise_. She\r\nhad lived much on the Continent, and appreciated the greater deference\r\npaid to a charming and accomplished woman in Viennese and Parisian\r\nsociety, compared with the boorishness of Englishmen who would not\r\n\"waste their time\" in paying pretty compliments to ladies which \"could\r\nbe repaid by a smile.\" She records her impressions in French, a language\r\nin which she was thoroughly proficient. \"Je sais,\" she says, \"qu'en\r\nAngleterre il ne faut pas s'attendre à cultiver son esprit; qu'il faut,\r\npour être contente à Londres, se résoudre à se plaire avec la\r\nmédiocrité; à entendre tous les jours répéter les mêmes banalités et à\r\ns'abaisser autant qu'on le peut au niveau des femmelettes avec\r\nlesquelles l'on vit, et qui, pour plaire, affectent plus de frivolité\r\nqu'elles n'ont réellement. Le plaisir de causer nous est défendu.\"\r\nNevertheless, however much she may have mentally appreciated the\r\nsolitude of a crowd, she determined to adapt herself to her social\r\nsurroundings. \"C'est un sacrifice,\" she says, \"que je fais à mon Dieu et\r\nà mon devoir comme Anglaise.\" Impelled, therefore, alike by piety and\r\npatriotism, she cast aside all ideas of leading an eremitic life,\r\nplunged into the vortex of the social world, and mixed with all the\r\ngreat men and women of the day. Of these the most notable was the Duke\r\nof Wellington.\r\n\r\nLady Shelley certainly possessed one quality which eminently fitted her\r\nto play the part of Boswell to the Duke. The worship of her hero was\r\nwithout the least mixture of alloy. She had a pheasant, which the Duke\r\nhad killed, stuffed, and \"added to other souvenirs which ornamented her\r\ndressing-room\"; and she records, with manifest pride, that \"amongst her\r\nother treasures\" was a chair on which he sat upon the first occasion of\r\nhis dining with her husband and herself in 1814. It was well to have\r\nthat pheasant stuffed, for apparently the Duke, like his great\r\nantagonist, did not shoot many pheasants. He was not only \"a very wild\r\nshot,\" but also a very bad shot. Napoleon, Mr. Oman tells us,[84] on one\r\noccasion \"lodged some pellets in Masséna's left eye while letting fly at\r\na pheasant,\" and then without the least hesitation accused \"the faithful\r\nBerthier\" of having fired the shot, an accusation which was at once\r\nconfirmed by the mendacious but courtierlike victim of the accident.\r\nWellington also, Lady Shelley records, \"after wounding a retriever early\r\nin the day and later on peppering the keeper's gaiters, inadvertently\r\nsprinkled the bare arms of an old woman who chanced to be washing\r\nclothes at her cottage window.\" Lady Shelley, who \"was attracted by her\r\nscreams,\" promptly told the widow that \"it ought to be the proudest\r\nmoment of her life. She had had the distinction of being shot by the\r\ngreat Duke of Wellington,\" but the eminently practical instinct of the\r\ngreat Duke at once whispered to him that something more than the moral\r\nsatisfaction to be derived from this reflection was required, so he very\r\nwisely \"slipped a golden coin into her trembling hand.\"\r\n\r\nFor many years Lady Shelley lived on very friendly and intimate terms\r\nwith the Duke, who appears to have confided to her many things about\r\nwhich he would perhaps have acted more wisely if he had held his tongue.\r\nWhen he went on an important diplomatic mission to Paris in 1822, she\r\nrequested him to buy her a blouse--a commission which he faithfully\r\nexecuted. All went well until 1848. Then a terrific explosion occurred.\r\nIt is no longer \"My dearest Lady! Mind you bring the blouse! Ever yours\r\nmost affectionately, Wellington,\" but \"My dear Lady Shelley,\" who is\r\naddressed by \"Her Ladyship's most obedient humble servant, Wellington,\"\r\nand soundly rated for her conduct. The reason for this abrupt and\r\nvolcanic change was that owing to an indiscretion on the part of Lady\r\nShelley a very important letter about the defenceless state of the\r\ncountry, which the Duke had addressed to Sir John Burgoyne, then the\r\nhead of the Engineer Department at the Horse Guards, got into the\r\nnewspapers. The Duke's wrath boiled over, and was expressed in terms\r\nwhich, albeit the reproaches were just, showed but little chivalrous\r\nconsideration towards a peccant but very contrite woman. He told her\r\nthat he \"had much to do besides defending himself from the consequences\r\nof the meddling gossip of the ladies of modern times,\" and he asked\r\nindignantly, \"What do Sir John Burgoyne and his family and your Ladyship\r\nand others--talking of old friendship--say to the share which each of\r\nyou have had in this transaction, which, in my opinion, is disgraceful\r\nto the times in which we live?\" What Sir John Burgoyne and his family\r\nmight very reasonably have said in answer to this formidable\r\ninterrogatory is that, although no one can defend the conduct of\r\nDelilah, it was certainly most unwise of Samson to trust her with his\r\nsecret. It is consolatory to know that, under the influence of Sir John\r\nShelley's tact and good-humour, a treaty of peace was eventually\r\nconcluded. Sir John happened to meet the Duke at a party.\r\n\"'Good-evening, Duke,' said Sir John, in his most winning manner. 'Do\r\nyou know, it has been said, by some one who must have been present, that\r\nthe cackling of geese once saved Rome. I have been thinking that perhaps\r\nthe cackling of my old Goose may yet save England!' This wholly\r\nunexpected sally proved too much for the Duke, who burst out into a\r\nhearty laugh. 'By G----d, Shelley!' said he, 'you are right: give me\r\nyour honest hand.'\" The Duke then returned to Apsley House and \"penned a\r\nplayful letter to Lady Shelley.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not to be expected that much of real historical interest can be\r\nextracted from a Diary of this sort. It may, however, be noted that when\r\nthe _Bellerophon_ reached the English coast \"it was only by coercion\r\nthat the Ministers prevented George IV. from receiving Bonaparte. The\r\nKing wanted to hold him as a captive.\" Moreover, Brougham, who was in a\r\nposition to know, said, \"There can be little doubt that if Bonaparte had\r\ngot to London, the Whig Opposition were ready to use him as their trump\r\ncard to overturn the Government.\"\r\n\r\nThe main interest in the book, however, lies in the light which it\r\nthrows on the Duke's inner life and in the characteristic _obiter dicta_\r\nwhich he occasionally let fall. Of these, none is more characteristic\r\nthan the remark he made on meeting his former love, Miss Catherine\r\nPakenham, after an absence of eight years in India. He wrote to her,\r\nmaking a proposal of marriage, but Miss Pakenham told him \"that before\r\nany engagement was made he must see her again; as she had grown old, had\r\nlost all her good looks, and was a very different person to the girl he\r\nhad loved in former years.\" The story, which has been frequently\r\nrepeated, that Miss Pakenham was marked with the smallpox, is\r\nuntrue,[85] but, without doubt, during the Duke's absence, she had a\r\ngood deal changed. The Duke himself certainly thought so, for, on first\r\nmeeting her again, he whispered to his brother, \"She has grown d----d\r\nugly, by Jove!\" Nevertheless he married her, being moved to do so, not\r\napparently from any very deep feelings of affection, but because his\r\nleading passion was a profound regard for truth and loyalty which led\r\nhim to admire and appreciate the straightforwardness of Miss Pakenham's\r\nconduct. Lady Shelley exultingly exclaims, \"Well might she be proud and\r\nhappy, and glory in such a husband.\" That the Duchess was proud of her\r\nhusband is certain. Whether she was altogether happy is more doubtful.\r\n\r\nOne of the stock anecdotes about the Duke of Wellington is that when on\r\none occasion some one asked him whether he was surprised at Waterloo, he\r\nreplied, \"No. I was not surprised then, but I am now.\" We are indebted\r\nto Lady Shelley for letting us know what the Duke really thought on this\r\nmuch-debated question. In a letter written to her on March 22, 1820, he\r\nstated, with his usual downright common sense, all that there is to be\r\nsaid on this subject. \"Supposing I _was_ surprised; I won the battle;\r\nand what could you have had more, even if I had not been surprised?\"\r\n\r\nIt is known on the authority of his niece, Lady Burghersh, that the Duke\r\n\"never read poetry,\" but his \"real love of music,\" to which Lady Shelley\r\nalludes, will perhaps come as a surprise to many. Mr. Fortescue,\r\nhowever,[86] has told us that in his youth the Duke learnt to play the\r\nviolin, and that he only abandoned it, when he was about thirty years\r\nold, \"because he judged it unseemly or perhaps ill-sounding for a\r\nGeneral to be a fiddler.\" The Duke is not the only great soldier who has\r\nbeen a musical performer. Marshal St. Cyr used to play the violin \"in\r\nthe quiet moments of a campaign,\" and Sir Hope Grant was a very fair\r\nperformer on the violoncello.\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of the Duke to keep the fact of his being about to\r\nfight a duel with Lord Winchelsea carefully concealed from all his\r\nfriends. When it was over, he walked into Lady Shelley's room while she\r\nwas at breakfast and said, \"Well, what do you think of a gentleman who\r\nhas been fighting a duel?\"\r\n\r\nIt appears that during the last years of his life the Duke's great\r\ncompanion-in-arms, Blücher, was subject to some strange hallucinations.\r\nThe following affords a fitting counterpart to those \"fears of the\r\nbrave\" which Pope attributed to the dying Marlborough. On March 17,\r\n1819, Lady Shelley made the following entry in her diary:\r\n\r\n     We laughed at poor Blücher's strange hallucination, which, though\r\n     ludicrous, is very sad. He fancies himself with child by a\r\n     Frenchman; and deplores that such an event should have happened to\r\n     him in his old age! He does not so much mind being with child, but\r\n     cannot reconcile himself to the thought that he--of all people in\r\n     the world--should be destined to give birth to a _Frenchman_! On\r\n     every other subject Blücher is said to be quite rational. This\r\n     peculiar form of madness shows the bent of his mind; so that while\r\n     we laugh our hearts reproach us. The Duke of Wellington assures me\r\n     that he knows this to be a fact.\r\n\r\nFinally, attention may be drawn to a singular and interesting letter\r\nfrom Sir Walter Scott to Shelley, giving some advice which it may be\r\npresumed the young poet did not take to heart. He was \"cautioned against\r\nenthusiasm, which, while it argued an excellent disposition and a\r\nfeeling heart, requires to be watched and restrained, though not\r\nrepressed.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: _The Diary of Frances, Lady Shelley_ (1818-1873).

Then the customary fit of doubt and despondency\r\nsupervened. It was not until four years after the conclusion of peace\r\nthat a British Resident was sent to the Court of Ava in the vain hope\r\nthat he would be able to negotiate the retrocession of the province of\r\nTenasserim, as \"the Directors of the East India Company looked upon this\r\nterritory as of no value to them.\" For a quarter of a century peace was\r\npreserved, for there ruled at Ava a prince \"who was too clear-sighted to\r\nattempt again to measure arms with the British troops.\" Anon he was\r\nsucceeded by a new king--the Pagàn Prince--\"who cared for nothing but\r\nmains of cocks, games, and other infantile amusements,\" and who, after\r\nthe manner of Oriental despots, inaugurated his reign by putting to\r\ndeath his two brothers and all their households. \"There were several\r\nhundreds of them.\" It is not surprising that under a ruler addicted to\r\nsuch practices the British sailors who frequented the Burmese ports\r\nshould have been subjected to maltreatment. Their complaints reached the\r\nears of the iron-fisted and acquisitive Lord Dalhousie, who himself\r\nwent to Rangoon in 1852, and forthwith \"decided on the immediate attack\r\nof Prome and Pegu.\" M. Dautremer speaks in flattering terms of \"the\r\ntenacity and persistence of purpose which make the strength and glory of\r\nBritish policy.\" He might truthfully have added another characteristic\r\nfeature which that policy at times displays, to wit, sluggishness. It\r\nwas not until sixteen years after Lord Dalhousie's annexation of Lower\r\nBurma that the English bethought themselves of improving their newly\r\nacquired province by the construction of a railway, and it was not till\r\n1877 that the first line from Rangoon to Prome--a distance of only one\r\nhundred and sixty-one miles--was opened. During all this time King\r\nMindon ruled in native Burma. He \"gave abundant alms to monks,\" and,\r\nmoreover, which was perhaps more to the purpose, he was wise enough to\r\nmaintain relations with Great Britain which were \"quite cordial.\"\r\nEventually the Nemesis which appears to attend on all semi-civilised and\r\nmoribund States when they are brought in contact with a vigorous and\r\naggressive civilisation appeared in the person of the \"Sapaya-lat,\" the\r\n\"middle princess,\" who induced her feeble husband, King Thibaw, to carry\r\nout massacres on a scale which, even in Burma, had been heretofore\r\nunprecedented. Then the British on the other side of the frontier began\r\nto murmur and \"to consider whether it was possible to endure a neighbour\r\nwho was so cruel and so unpopular.\" All doubts as to whether the limits\r\nof endurance had or had not been reached were removed when the\r\nimpecunious and spendthrift king not only imposed a very unjust fine of\r\nsome £150,000 on the Bombay-Burma Trading Corporation, but also had the\r\nextreme folly to \"throw himself into the arms of France\"--a scheme which\r\nwas at once communicated by M. Jules Ferry to Lord Lyons, the British\r\nAmbassador in Paris. Then war with Burma was declared, and after some\r\ntedious operations, which involved the sacrifice of many valuable lives,\r\nand which extended over three years, the country was \"completely\r\npacified\" by 1889, and Lord Dufferin added the title of \"Ava\" to the\r\nMarquisate which was conferred on him.\r\n\r\nIn 1852, when Lord Dalhousie annexed Lower Burma, Rangoon was \"merely a\r\nfishing village.\" It is now a flourishing commercial town of some\r\n300,000 inhabitants. In 1910-11 the imports into Burmese ports,\r\nincluding coast trade, amounted to £13,600,000. The exports, in spite of\r\na duty on rice which is of a nature rather to shock orthodox economists,\r\nwere nearly £23,000,000 in value. The revenue in 1910 was about\r\n£7,391,000, of which about £2,590,000 was on Imperial and the balance on\r\nlocal account. Burma is in the happy position of being in a normal state\r\nof surplus, and is thus able to contribute annually a sum of about\r\n£2,500,000 to the Indian exchequer, a sum which those who are specially\r\ninterested in Burmese prosperity regard as excessive, whilst it is\r\napparently regarded as inadequate by some of those who look only to the\r\ninterests of the Indian taxpayers.\r\n\r\nThe account which M. Dautremer, who was for long French Consul at\r\nRangoon, has given of the present condition of Burma is preceded by an\r\nintroduction from the pen of Sir George Scott, who can speak with\r\nunquestionable authority on Burmese affairs. It is clear that neither\r\nauthor has allowed himself in any way to be biassed by national\r\nproclivities, for whilst the Frenchman compares British and French\r\nadministrative methods in a manner which is very much to the detriment\r\nof the latter, the Englishman, on the other hand, launches the most\r\nfiery denunciations against those of his countrymen who are responsible\r\nfor Indian policy. Their want of enterprise is characterised by the\r\nappalling polysyllabic adjective \"hebetudinous,\" which it is perhaps as\r\nwell to explain means obtuse or dull, and they are told that they \"are\r\ninfected with the Babu spirit, and cannot see beyond their immediate\r\nhorizon.\"\r\n\r\nM. Dautremer thinks that it is somewhat narrow-minded of the Englishman\r\nto inflict on himself the torture of wearing cloth or flannel clothes in\r\norder that he may not be taken for a _chi-chi_ or half-caste, who very\r\nwisely dresses in white. He expostulates against the social tyranny\r\nwhich obliges him to pay visits between twelve and two \"in such a\r\nclimate and with such a temperature,\" and he gently satirises the\r\nisolation of the different layers of English society--civilian,\r\nmilitary, and subordinate services--in words which call to mind the\r\nstriking account given by the immortal Mr. Jingle of the dockyard\r\nsociety of Chatham and Rochester. It is, however, consolatory to learn\r\nthat all classes combined in giving a hearty welcome to the genial and\r\nsympathetic Frenchman who was living in their midst. Save on these minor\r\npoints, M. Dautremer has, for the most part, nothing but praise to\r\naccord. He thinks that \"all the British administrative officers in Burma\r\nare well-educated and capable men, who know the country of which they\r\nare put in charge, and are fluent in the language.\" He writhes under the\r\nhighly centralised and bureaucratic system adopted by his own\r\ncountrymen. He commends the English practice under which \"the Home\r\nGovernment never interferes in the management of internal affairs,\" and\r\nit is earnestly to be hoped that the commendation is deserved, albeit of\r\nlate years there have occasionally been some ominous signs of a tendency\r\nto govern India rather too much in detail from London. Speaking of the\r\nrapid development of Burmese trade, M. Dautremer says, in words which\r\nare manifestly intended to convey a criticism of his own Government,\r\n\"This is an example of the use of colonies to a nation which knows how\r\nto put a proper value on them and to profit by them.\"\r\n\r\nThe warm appreciation which M. Dautremer displays of the best parts of\r\nthe English administrative system enhances his claims for respectful\r\nattention whenever he indulges in criticism. He finds two rather weak\r\npoints in the administration. In the first place, he attributes the\r\nlarge falling-off in the export of teak, _inter alia_, to \"the increase\r\nin Government duties and the much more rigid rules for extraction,\" and\r\nhe adds that the Government, which is itself a large dealer in timber,\r\nhas \"by its action created a monopoly which has raised prices to the\r\nhighest possible limit.\" The subject is one which would appear to\r\nrequire attention. The primary business of any Government is not to\r\ntrade but to administer, and, as invariably happens, the violation of a\r\nsound economic principle of this sort is certain sooner or later to\r\ncarry its own punishment with it. In the second place, the Forest\r\nDepartment, which is of very special importance in Burma, is a good deal\r\ncrippled by the \"want of energy and want of industry which are\r\nunfortunately common in the subordinate grades. The reason for this\r\nstate of things is to be found in the fact that the pay and prospects\r\nare not good enough to attract really capable men.\" In many quarters,\r\nnotably in Central Africa, British Treasury officials have yet to learn\r\nthat, from every point of view, it is quite as great a mistake to employ\r\nunderpaid administrative agents as it would be for an employer of labour\r\nto proceed on the principle that low wages necessarily connote cheap\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nSir George Scott in his introduction strikes a very different note from\r\nthat sounded by M. Dautremer. He alleges that the wealthy province of\r\nBurma, which M. Dautremer tells us is not unseldom called \"the milch-cow\r\nof India,\" is starved, that its financial policy has been directed by\r\n\"cautious, nothing-venture, mole-horizon people,\" who have hid their\r\ntalent in a napkin; that \"everything seems expressly designed to drive\r\nout the capital\" of which the country stands so much in need; that not\r\nnearly enough has been done in the way of expenditure on public works,\r\nnotably on roads and railways, and that when these latter have been\r\nconstructed, they have sometimes been in the wrong directions. He cavils\r\nat M. Dautremer's description of Burma as \"a model possession,\" and\r\nholds that \"as a matter of bitter fact, the administrative view is that\r\nof the parish beadle, and the enterprise that of the country-carrier\r\nwith a light cart instead of a motor-van.\"\r\n\r\nIt would require greater local knowledge than any possessed by the\r\nwriter of the present article either to endorse or to reject these\r\nformidable accusations, although it may be said that the violence of Sir\r\nGeorge Scott's invective is not very convincing, but rather raises a\r\nstrong suspicion that he has overstated his case. Nothing is more\r\ndifficult, either for a private individual or for a State financier,\r\nthan to decide the question of when to be bold and when cautious in the\r\nmatter of capital outlay. It is quite possible to push to an extreme the\r\ncommonplace, albeit attractive, argument that large expenditure will be\r\namply remunerative, or even if not directly remunerative, highly\r\nbeneficial \"in the long run.\" Although this plea is often--indeed,\r\nperhaps generally--valid, it is none the less true that the run which is\r\nforeshadowed is at times so long as to make the taxpayer, who has to\r\nbear the present cost, gasp for breath before the promised goal is\r\nreached. Pericles, by laying out huge sums on the public buildings of\r\nAthens, earned the undying gratitude of artistic posterity. Whether his\r\naction was in the true interests of his Athenian contemporaries is\r\nperhaps rather more doubtful. The recent history of Argentina is an\r\ninstance of a country in which, as subsequent events have proved, the\r\nplea for lavish capital expenditure was perfectly justifiable, but in\r\nwhich, nevertheless, the over-haste shown in incurring heavy liabilities\r\nled to much temporary inconvenience and even disaster. But on the whole\r\nit may be said that where all the general conditions are favourable, and\r\npoint conclusively to the possibility and probability of fairly rapid\r\neconomic development, a bold financial policy may and should be adopted,\r\neven although it may not be easy to prove beforehand by very exact\r\ncalculations that any special project under consideration will be\r\ndirectly remunerative. Egyptian finance is a case in point. At a time\r\nwhen the country was in the throes of bankruptcy, a fresh loan of\r\n£1,000,000 was, to the dismay of the conventional financiers,\r\ncontracted, the proceeds of which were spent on irrigation works. So\r\nalso the construction of the Assouan dam, which cost nearly double the\r\nsum originally estimated, was taken in hand at a moment when a\r\nliability of a wholly unknown amount on account of the war in the Soudan\r\nwas hanging over the head of the Egyptian Treasury. In both of these\r\ncases subsequent events amply justified the financial audacity which had\r\nbeen shown. In the case of Burma there appears to be no doubt as to the\r\nwealth of the province or its capacity for further development. In view\r\nof all the circumstances of the case the amount of twelve millions,\r\nwhich is apparently all that has been spent on railway construction\r\nsince 1869, would certainly appear to be rather a niggardly sum. In\r\nspite, therefore, of the very unnecessary warmth with which Sir George\r\nScott has urged his views, it is to be hoped that his plea for the\r\nadoption of a somewhat bolder financial policy in the direction of\r\nexpenditure on railways, and still more on feeder roads, will receive\r\nfrom the India Office, with whom the matter really rests, the attention\r\nwhich it would certainly appear to deserve. The case of public\r\nbuildings, of which Burma apparently stands much in need, is different.\r\nThey cannot, strictly speaking, be said to be remunerative, and should\r\nalmost, if not quite, invariably be paid for out of revenue.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: _Burma under British Rule_.

It was probably a\r\nprofound want of confidence in the accuracy of biographical writing that\r\nled Horace Walpole to beg for \"anything but history, for history must be\r\nfalse.\" Modern industry and research, ferreting in the less frequented\r\nbypaths of history, have exposed many fictions, and have often led to\r\nsome strikingly paradoxical conclusions. They have substituted for\r\nCambronne's apocryphal saying at Waterloo the blunt sarcasm of the Duke\r\nof Wellington that there were a number of ladies at Brussels who were\r\ntermed \"la vieille garde,\" and of whom it was said \"elles ne meurent\r\npas et se rendent toujours.\" They have led one eminent historian to\r\napologise for the polygamous tendencies of Henry VIII.; another to\r\nadvance the startling proposition that the \"amazing\" but, as the world\r\nhas heretofore held, infamous Emperor Heliogabalus was a great religious\r\nreformer, who was in advance of his times; a third to present Lucrezia\r\nBorgia to the world as a much-maligned and very virtuous woman; and a\r\nfourth to tell us that the \"ever pusillanimous\" Barère, as he is called\r\nby M. Louis Madelin, was \"persistently vilified and deliberately\r\nmisunderstood.\" Biographical research has, moreover, destroyed many\r\npicturesque legends, with some of which posterity cannot part without a\r\npang of regret. We are reluctant to believe that William Tell was a\r\nmythological marksman and Gessler a wholly impossible bailiff.\r\nNevertheless the inexorable laws of evidence demand that this sacrifice\r\nshould be made on the altar of historical truth. M. Gastine has now\r\nruthlessly quashed out another picturesque legend. Tallien--the\r\n\"bristly, fox-haired\" Tallien of Carlyle's historical rhapsody--and La\r\nCabarrus--the fair Spanish Proserpine whom, \"Pluto-like, he gathered at\r\nBordeaux\"--have so far floated down the tide of history as individuals\r\nwho, like Byron's Corsair, were\r\n\r\n    Linked with one virtue and a thousand crimes.\r\n\r\nOf the crimes there could, indeed, never have been any doubt, but\r\nposterity took but little heed of them, for they were amply condoned by\r\nthe single virtue. That virtue was, indeed, of a transcendent character,\r\nfor it was nothing less than the delivery of the French nation from the\r\nDahomey-like rule of that Robespierre who deluged France in blood, and\r\nwho, albeit in Fouché's words he was \"terribly sincere,\" at the same\r\ntime \"never in his life cared for any one but himself and never forgave\r\nan offence.\" Moreover, the act of delivery was associated with an\r\nepisode eminently calculated to appeal to human sentiment and sympathy.\r\nIt was thought that the love of a fair woman whose life was endangered\r\nhad nerved the lover and the patriot to perform an heroic act at the\r\nimminent risk of his own life. Hence the hero became \"Le Lion Amoureux,\"\r\nand the heroine was canonised as \"Notre Dame de Thermidor.\"\r\n\r\nM. Gastine has now torn this legend to shreds. Under his pitiless\r\nanalysis of the facts, nothing is left but the story of a contemptible\r\nadventurer, who was \"a robber, a murderer, and a poltroon,\" mated to a\r\ngrasping, heartless courtesan. Both were alike infamous. The ignoble\r\ncareers of both from the cradle to the grave do not, in reality, present\r\na single redeeming feature.\r\n\r\nMadame Tallien was the daughter of François Cabarrus, a wealthy\r\nSpaniard who was the banker of the Spanish Court. The great influence\r\nwhich she unquestionably exerted over her contemporaries was wholly due\r\nto her astounding physical beauty. Her intellectual equipment was meagre\r\nin the extreme. At one period of her life she courted the society of\r\nMadame de Staël and other intellectuals, but Princess Hélène Ligne said\r\nof her that she \"had more jargon than wit.\" As regards her physical\r\nattractions, however, no dissentient voice has ever been raised. \"Her\r\nbeauty,\" the Duchess d'Abrantès says in her memoirs, \"of which the\r\nsculptors of antiquity give us but an incomplete idea, had a charm not\r\nmet with in the types of Greece and Rome.\" Every man who approached her\r\nappears to have become her victim. Lacretelle, who himself worshipped at\r\nher shrine, says, \"She appeared to most of us as the Spirit of Clemency\r\nincarnate in the loveliest of human forms.\" At a very early age she\r\nmarried a young French nobleman, the Marquis de Fontenay, from whom she\r\nwas speedily divorced. It is not known for what offence she was arrested\r\nand imprisoned. Probably the mere fact that she was a marquise was\r\nsufficient to entangle her in the meshes of the revolutionary net. It is\r\ncertain, however, that whilst lying under sentence of death in the\r\nprison at Bordeaux she attracted the attention of Tallien, the son of\r\nthe Marquis of Bercy's butler and _ci-devant_ lawyer's clerk, who had\r\nblossomed into \"a Terrorist of the first water.\" He obtained her release\r\nand she became his mistress. She took advantage of the equivocal but\r\ninfluential position which she had attained to engage in a vile traffic.\r\nShe and her paramour amassed a huge fortune by accepting money from the\r\nunfortunate prisoners who were threatened with the fate which she had so\r\nnarrowly escaped, and to which she was again to be exposed. The venal\r\nlenity shown by Tallien to aristocrats rendered him an object of\r\nsuspicion, whilst the marked tendency displayed by Robespierre to\r\nmistrust and, finally, to immolate his coadjutors was an ominous\r\nindication of the probable course of future events. Robespierre had\r\nalready destroyed Vergniaud by means of Hébert, Hébert by means of\r\nDanton, and Danton by means of Billaud. As a preliminary step to the\r\ndestruction of Tallien, he caused his mistress to be arrested, probably\r\nwith a view to seeing what evidence against her paramour could be\r\nextracted before she was herself guillotined.\r\n\r\nFrom this point in the narrative history is merged into legend. The\r\nlegend would have us believe that on the 7th Thermidor the \"Citoyenne\r\nFontenay\" sent a dagger to the \"Citoyen Tallien,\" accompanied by a\r\nletter in which she said that she had dreamt that Robespierre was no\r\nmore, and that the gates of her prison had been flung open. \"Alas!\" she\r\nadded, \"thanks to your signal cowardice there will soon be no one left\r\nin France capable of bringing such a dream to pass.\" Tallien besought\r\nRobespierre to show mercy, but \"the Incorruptible was inflexible.\" Then\r\nthe \"Lion Amoureux\" roared, being, as the legend relates, stricken to\r\nthe heart at the appalling danger to which his beloved mistress was\r\nexposed or, as his detractors put the case, being in deadly fear that\r\nthe untoward revelations of the Citoyenne might cost him his own head.\r\nThe next act in this Aeschylean drama is described by the believers in\r\nthe legend in the following words: \"Tallien drew Theresia's dagger from\r\nhis breast and flashed it in the sunlight as though to nerve himself for\r\nthe desperate business that confronted him. 'This,' he cried\r\npassionately, 'will be my final argument,' and looking about him to make\r\nsure he was alone he raised the blade to his lips and kissed it.\"\r\n\r\nThe result, it is alleged, was that Tallien provoked the episode of the\r\n9th Thermidor (July 22, 1794). The few faltering sentences which\r\nRobespierre wished to utter were never spoken. He was \"choked by the\r\nblood of Danton,\" and hurried off to the guillotine which awaited him on\r\nthe morrow.\r\n\r\nHistory, which in this instance is not legendary, relates that on the\r\ndeath of the tyrant a wild shout of exultation was raised by the joyous\r\npeople who had for so long wandered in the Valley of the Shadow of\r\nDeath. To whom, they asked, did they owe their liberty? What was more\r\nnatural than to assume that it was to the brave Tallien and to the\r\nloving woman who armed him to strike a blow for the freedom of France?\r\nTallien and his mistress became, therefore, the idols of the French\r\npeople. The Chancellor Pasquier relates their appearance at a theatre:\r\n\r\n     The enthusiasm and the applause were indescribable. The occupants\r\n     of the boxes, the people in the pit, men and women alike, stood up\r\n     on their chairs to look at him. It seemed as though they would\r\n     never weary of gazing at him. He was young, rather good-looking,\r\n     and his manner was calm and serene. Madame Tallien was at his side\r\n     and shared his triumph. In her case also everything had been\r\n     forgiven and forgotten. Similar scenes were enacted all through the\r\n     autumn of that year. Never was any service, however great, rewarded\r\n     by gratitude so lively and so touching.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible within the limits of the present article to\r\nsummarise the arguments by which M. Gastine seeks to destroy this myth.\r\nAllusion may, however, be made to two points of special importance. The\r\nfirst is that neither Tallien nor the lovely Spaniard languishing in\r\nthe dungeon of La Force had much to do with the episode of the 9th\r\nThermidor. \"Tallien was a mere super, a mere puppet that had to be\r\ngalvanised into action up to the very last.\" The man who really\r\norganised the movement and persuaded his coadjutors that they were\r\nengaged in a life and death struggle with Robespierre was he who, as\r\nevery reader of revolutionary history knows, was busily engaged in\r\npulling the strings behind the scenes during the whole of this chaotic\r\nperiod. It was the man whose iron nerve and subtle brain enabled him, in\r\nspite of a secular course of betrayals, to keep his head on his\r\nshoulders, and finally to escape the clutches of Napoleon, who, as Lord\r\nRosebery tells us,[89] always deeply regretted that he had not had him\r\n\"hanged or shot.\" It was Fouché.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, there is conclusive evidence to show that, to use\r\nthe ordinary slang expression of the present day, the celebrated dagger\r\nletter was \"faked.\" When Robespierre fell, Tallien never gave a thought\r\nto his mistress. He still trembled for his own life. \"His sole aim was\r\nto make away with Robespierre's papers.\" It was only on the 12th\r\nThermidor--that is to say, two days after Robespierre's mangled head had\r\nbeen sheared off by the guillotine--that, noting the trend of public\r\nopinion, and appreciating the capital which might be made out of the\r\ncurrent myth, he hurried off to La Force and there concocted with his\r\nmistress the famous letter which he, of course, antedated.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent careers of Tallien and his wife--for he married La\r\nCabarrus in December 1794--are merely characterised by a number of\r\nunedifying details. The hero of this sordid tale passed through many\r\nvicissitudes. He went with Napoleon to Egypt. He was, on his return\r\nvoyage, taken prisoner by an English cruiser. On his arrival in London\r\nhe was well received by Fox and the Whigs--a fact which cannot be said\r\nto redound much to the credit either of the Whig party or its leader. He\r\ngambled on the Stock Exchange, and at one time \"blossomed out as a\r\ndealer in soap, candles, and cotton bonnets.\" After passing through an\r\nunhonoured old age, he died in great poverty in 1820. The heroine became\r\nintimate with Josephine during Napoleon's absence in Egypt, was\r\nsubsequently divorced from Tallien, and later, after passing through a\r\nphase when she was the mistress of the banker Ouvrard, married the\r\nPrince of Caraman-Chimay. Her conduct during the latter years of her\r\nlife appears to have been irreproachable. She died in 1835.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: _The Life of Madame Tallien._ By L. Gastine.

Like most monopolists, they\r\nshowed a marked tendency to abuse the advantages of their position.\r\nScience was relegated to a position of humiliating inferiority, and had\r\nto content itself with picking up whatever crumbs were, with a lordly\r\nand at times almost contemptuous tolerance, allowed to fall from the\r\nhumanistic table. Bossuet once defined a heretic as \"celui qui a une\r\nopinion\" (αἵρεσις). A somewhat similar attitude was at one time adopted\r\nto those who were inclined to doubt whether a knowledge of Latin and\r\nGreek could be considered the Alpha and Omega of a sound education. The\r\ncalm judgment of that great humanist, Professor Jebb, led him to the\r\nconclusion that the claims of the humanities have been at times defended\r\nby pleas which were exaggerated and paradoxical--using this latter term\r\nin the sense of arguments which contain an element of truth, but of\r\ntruth which has been distorted--and that in an age remarkable beyond all\r\nprevious ages for scientific research and discoveries, that nation must\r\nnecessarily lag behind which, in the well-known words uttered by Gibbon\r\nat a time when science was still in swaddling-clothes, fears that the\r\n\"finer feelings\" are destroyed if the mind becomes \"hardened by the\r\nhabit of rigid demonstration.\" All this has now been changed. Professor\r\nHuxley did not live in vain. His mantle fell on the shoulders of many\r\nother doughty champions who shared his views. Science no longer slinks\r\nmodestly in educational bypaths, but occupies the high road, and, to say\r\nthe least, marches abreast of her humanistic sister. Yet the scientists\r\nare not yet content. Their souls are athirst for further victories. A\r\nhigh authority on education, himself a classical scholar,[90] has\r\nrecently told us that, although the English boy \"as he emerges from the\r\ncrucible of the public school laboratory\" may be a fairly good agent\r\nfor dealing with the \"lower or more submissive races in the wilds of\r\nAfrica or in the plains of India,\" elsewhere--notably in Canada--he is\r\n\"a conspicuous failure\"; that one of the principal reasons why he is a\r\nfailure is that \"the influence of the humanists still reigns over us\";\r\nand that \"the future destiny of the Empire is wrapt up in the immediate\r\nreform of England's educational system.\" In the course of that reform,\r\nwhich it is proposed should be of a very drastic character, some\r\nhalf-hearted efforts may conceivably be made to effect the salvage of\r\nwhatever will remain of the humanistic wreck, but the real motto of the\r\nreformers will almost certainly be Utilitarianism, writ large. The\r\nhumanists, therefore, are placed on their defence. It may be that the\r\nwalls of their entrenchment, which have already been a good deal\r\nbattered, will fall down altogether, and that the garrison will be asked\r\nto submit to a capitulation which will be almost unconditional.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the din of battle which may already be heard, and which\r\nwill probably ere long become louder, it seems very desirable that the\r\nvoices of those who are neither profound scholars nor accomplished\r\nscientists nor educational experts should be heard. These--and there are\r\nmany such--ask, What is the end which we should seek to attain? Can\r\nscience alone be trusted to prevent education becoming, in the words of\r\nthat sturdy old pagan, Thomas Love Peacock, a \"means for giving a fixed\r\ndirection to stupidity\"? The answer they, or many of them, give to these\r\nquestions is that the main end of education is to teach people to think,\r\nand that they are not prepared to play false to their own intellects to\r\nsuch an extent as to believe that the national power of thinking will\r\nnot be impaired if it is deprived of the teaching of the most thoughtful\r\nnation which the world has ever known. That nation is Greece. These\r\nclasses, therefore, lift up their hands in supplication to scientists,\r\neducational experts, and parliamentarians--yea, even to soulless\r\nwire-pullers who would perhaps willingly cast Homer and Sophocles to the\r\ndogs in order to win a contested election--and with one voice cry: We\r\nrecognise the need of reform; we wish to march with the times; we are no\r\nenemies to science; but in the midst of your utilitarian ideas, we\r\nimplore you, in the name both of learning and common sense, to devise\r\nsome scheme which will still enable the humanities to act as some check\r\non the growing materialism of the age; otherwise the last stage of the\r\neducated youth of this country will be worse than the first; remember\r\nwhat Lucretius--on the bold assumption that wire-pullers ever read\r\nLucretius--said, \"Hic Acherusia stultorum denique vita\"; above all\r\nthings, let there be no panic legislation--and panic is a danger to\r\nwhich democracies and even, Pindar has told us, \"the sons of the\r\ngods,\"[91] are greatly exposed; in taking any new departure let us,\r\ntherefore, very carefully and deliberately consider how we can best\r\npreserve all that is good in our existing system.\r\n\r\nWhatever temporary effect appeals of this sort may produce, it is\r\ncertain that the ultimate result must depend very greatly on the extent\r\nto which a real interest in classical literature can be kept alive in\r\nthe minds of the rising and of future generations. How can this object\r\nbest be achieved? The question is one of vital importance.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the present article would be the last to attempt to raise\r\na cheap laugh at the expense of that laborious and, as it may appear to\r\nsome, almost useless erudition which, for instance, led Professor\r\nHermann to write four books on the particle ἄν and to indite a learned\r\ndissertation on αὐτός. The combination of industry and enthusiasm\r\ndisplayed in efforts such as these has not been wasted. The spirit which\r\ninspired them has materially contributed to the real stock of valuable\r\nknowledge which the world possesses. None the less it must be admitted\r\nthat something more than mere erudition is required to conjure away the\r\nperils which the humanities now have to face. It is necessary to quicken\r\nthe interest of the rising generation, to show them that it is not only\r\nhistorically true to say, with Lessing, that \"with Greece the morning\r\nbroke,\" but that it is equally true to maintain that in what may,\r\nrelatively speaking, be called the midday splendour of learning, we\r\ncannot dispense with the guiding light of the early morn; that Greek\r\nliterature, in Professor Gilbert Murray's words,[92] is \"an embodiment\r\nof the progressive spirit, an expression of the struggle of the human\r\nsoul towards freedom and ennoblement\"; and that our young men and women\r\nwill be, both morally and intellectually, the poorer if they listen to\r\nthe insidious and deceptive voice of an exaggerated materialism which\r\nwhispers that amidst the hum of modern machinery and the heated wrangles\r\nincident to the perplexing problems which arise as the world grows\r\nolder, the knowledge of a language and a literature which have survived\r\ntwo thousand eight hundred storm-tossed years is \"of no practical use.\"\r\n\r\nIt is this interest which the works of a man like the late Dr. Verrall\r\nserve to stimulate. He was eminently fitted for the task. On the\r\nprinciple which Dr. Johnson mocked by saying that \"who drives fat oxen\r\nshould himself be fat,\" it may be said that an advocate of humanistic\r\nlearning should himself be human in the true and Terentian meaning of\r\nthat somewhat ambiguous word. This is what Verrall was. All who knew him\r\nspeak of his lovable character, and others who were in this respect less\r\nfavoured can judge of the genuineness of his human sympathies by\r\napplying two well-nigh infallible tests. He loved children, and he was\r\nimbued with what Professor Mackail very appropriately calls in his\r\ncommemorative address \"a delightful love of nonsense.\" His kindly and\r\ngenial humour sparkles, indeed, in every line he wrote. Moreover,\r\nwhether he was right or wrong in the highly unconventional views which\r\nhe at times expressed, his scorn for literary orthodoxy was in itself\r\nvery attractive. Whenever he found what he called a \"boggle\"--that is to\r\nsay an incident or a phrase in respect to which, he was dissatisfied\r\nwith the conventional explanation--\"he could not rest until he had made\r\nan effort to get to the bottom of it.\" He treated old subjects with an\r\noriginality which rejuvenated them, and decked them again with the charm\r\nof novelty. He bade us, with a copy of Martial in our hands, accompany\r\nhim to the Coliseum and be, in imagination, one of the sixty thousand\r\nspectators who thronged to behold the strange Africans, Sarmatians, and\r\nothers who are gathered together from the four quarters of the Roman\r\nworld to take part in the Saturnalia. He asked us to watch with\r\nPropertius whilst the slumbers of his Cynthia were disturbed by dreams\r\nthat she was flying from one of her all too numerous lovers. Under his\r\ntreatment, Mr. Cornford says, the most commonplace passages in classical\r\nliterature \"began to glow with passion and to flash with wit.\" His main\r\nliterary achievement is thus recorded on the tablet erected to his\r\nmemory at Trinity College: \"Euripidis famam vindicavit.\" He threw\r\nhimself with ardour into the discussion on the merits and demerits of\r\nthe Greek tragedian which has been going on ever since it was originally\r\nstarted by Aristophanes, and he may at least be said to have shown that\r\nwhat French Boileau said of his own poetry applies with equal force to\r\nthe Greek--\"Mon vers, bien ou mal, dit toujours quelque chose.\" In the\r\nprocess of rehabilitating Euripides, Verrall threw out brilliantly\r\noriginal ideas in every direction. Take, for instance, his treatment of\r\nthe _Ion_. Every one who has dabbled in Greek literature knows that\r\nEuripides was a free-thinker, albeit in his old age he did lip-service\r\nto the current theology of the day, and told the Athenians that they\r\nshould not \"apply sophistry,\" or, in other words rationalise, about the\r\ngods.[93] Every one also has rather marvelled at the somewhat lame and\r\nimpotent conclusion of the play when Athene--herself in reality one of\r\nthe most infamous of the Olympian deities--is brought on the stage to\r\nsave the prestige of the oracle at Delphi and to explain away the\r\naltogether disreputable behaviour of the no less infamous Apollo. But no\r\none before Verrall had thought of coupling together the free-thinking\r\nand the episode in the play. This is what Verrall did. Ion sees that the\r\noracle can lie, and, therefore, \"Delphi is plainly discredited as a\r\nfountain of truth.\" The explanation is, of course, somewhat conjectural.\r\nHomer, who was certainly not a free-thinker, made his deities\r\nsufficiently ridiculous, and, at times, altogether odious. Mr. Lang says\r\nwith truth: \"When Homer touches on the less lovable humours of women--on\r\nthe nagging shrew, the light o' love, the rather bitter virgin--he\r\nselects his examples from the divine society of the gods.\"[94] But\r\nwhether the very plausible conjectures made by Verrall as to the real\r\npurpose of Euripides in his treatment of the oracle in _Ion_, or, to\r\nquote another instance, his explanation of the phantom in _Helen_, be\r\nright or wrong, no one can deny that what he wrote is alive with\r\ninterest. On this point, the testimony of his pupils, albeit in some\r\nrespects contradictory, is conclusive. One of them (Mr. Marsh) says: \"I\r\nwas usually convinced by everything,\" whilst another (Mr. J.R.M. Butler)\r\nsays: \"I don't think we believed very much what he said; he always said\r\nhe was as likely to be wrong as right. But he made all classics so\r\ngloriously new and living. He made us criticise by standards of common\r\nsense, and presume that the tragedians were not fools and that they did\r\nmean something. They were not to be taken as antiques privileged to use\r\nconventions that would be nonsense in any one else.\"\r\n\r\nClassical learning will not be kept alive for long by forcing young men\r\nwith perhaps a taste for science or the integral calculus to apply\r\nthemselves to the study of Aristotle or Sophocles. The real hope for the\r\nhumanities in the future lies in the teaching of such men as Butcher,\r\nVerrall, Gilbert Murray, Dill, Bevan, Livingstone, Zimmern, and, it may\r\nfortunately be said, many others, who can make the literature of the\r\nancient world and the personalities of its inhabitants live in the eyes\r\nof the present generation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: _The Public Schools and the Empire_.

The first, which is inscribed on the\r\ntitle-page, is St. Paul's statement to the Athenians that all nations of\r\nmen are of one blood. The second, which occurs towards the close of his\r\nwork, is that \"sane Imperialism is political Idealism.\" Both statements\r\nare paradoxical. Both contain a germ of truth. In both cases an extreme\r\napplication of the principle involved would lead to dire consequences.\r\nThe first aphorism leads us to the unquestionably sound conclusion that\r\nNewton, equally with a pygmy from the forests of Central Africa, was a\r\nhuman being. It does not take us much further. The second aphorism bids\r\nus remember that the statesman who is incapable of conceiving and\r\nattempting to realise an ideal is a mere empiricist, but it omits to\r\nmention that if this same statesman, in pursuit of his ideal, neglects\r\nall his facts and allows himself to become an inhabitant of a political\r\nCloud Cuckoo-land, he will certainly ruin his own reputation, and may\r\nnot improbably inflict very great injury upon the country and people\r\nwhich form the subject of his crude experiments. On the whole, if we are\r\nto apply that proverbial philosophy which is so dear to the mind of all\r\nEuropeanised Easterns to the solution of political problems, it will\r\nperhaps be as well to bear constantly in mind the excellent Sanskrit\r\nmaxim which, amidst a collection of wise saws, Mr. Mallik quotes in his\r\nfinal chapter, \"A wise man thinks of both _pro_ and _con_.\"\r\n\r\nStarting with a basis of somewhat extreme idealism, it is not surprising\r\nthat Mr. Mallik has developed not only into an ardent Indian\r\nnationalist, but also into an advanced Indian Radical. As to the latter\r\ncharacteristic, he manifestly does not like the upper classes of his own\r\ncountry. They are, in fact, as bad or even worse than English peers.\r\nThey are \"like the 'idle rich' elsewhere; they squander annually in\r\nluxuries and frivolities huge sums of money, besides hoarding up\r\njewels, gold and silver of immense value.\" Occasionally, they pose as\r\n\"upholders of the Government.\" \"Even so they do not conceal their fangs.\r\nWhen small measures of conciliation have in recent times been proposed,\r\nthe 'Peers' in India have not been slow to proclaim through their organs\r\nthat the Government were rousing their suspicion.\"\r\n\r\nTurning, however, to the relations between Europe and Asia, Mr. Mallik\r\nsays that it is often asserted that the two continents \"cannot\r\nunderstand each other--that Asia is a mystery to Europe, and must always\r\nremain so.\" Most people who have considered this subject have so far\r\nthought that the main reason why Europeans find it difficult to\r\nunderstand Asia is because, in some matters, Asia is difficult to\r\nunderstand. They have, therefore, been deeply grateful to men like the\r\nlate Sir Alfred Lyall, who have endeavoured with marked ability and\r\nsympathy to explain the mystery to them. But Mr. Mallik now explains to\r\nus that no such gratitude is due, for the reason why Asia is so often\r\nmisunderstood is not on account of any difficulties attendant on\r\ncomprehension, but because those who have paid special attention to the\r\nsubject are \"persons whose nature or training or self-interest leads\r\nthem not to wish the understanding to take place.\" Whether Mr. Mallik\r\nhas done much to lighten the prevailing darkness and to explain the East\r\nto the West is perhaps somewhat doubtful, but it is quite certain that\r\nhe has done his utmost to explain to those of his countrymen who are\r\nconversant with the English language the attitude which, in his opinion,\r\nthey should adopt towards Westerns and Western civilisation. In one of\r\nthe sweeping generalities in which his work abounds, Mr. Mallik says\r\nwith great truth, that \"however manners may differ ... nothing is gained\r\nby nursing a feeling of animosity.\" It is to be regretted that Mr.\r\nMallik has not himself acted on the wise principle which he here\r\nenunciates. He has, however, not done so. Under the familiar garb of a\r\nfriend who indulges in an excess of candour he has made a number of\r\nobservations which, whether true or false, are eminently calculated to\r\ninflame that racial animosity which it is the duty of every well-wisher\r\nof India to endeavour by every means in his power to allay. He makes a\r\nlengthy and elaborate comparison between East and West, in which every\r\nplague-spot in European civilisation is carefully catalogued. Every\r\nulcer in Western life is probed. Every possible sore in the connection\r\nbetween the European and Asiatic is made to rankle. On the other hand,\r\nwith the cries of the Christians massacred at Adana still ringing in\r\nour ears, Mr. Mallik, forgetful apparently of the fact that the Turk is\r\nan Asian, tells us that \"Asia, typical of the East, looks upon all races\r\nand creeds with absolute impartiality,\" and, further, that \"gentleness\r\nand consideration are the peculiar characteristics of the East, as\r\noverbearing and rudeness, miscalled independence, and not unfrequently\r\ndeserving to be called insolence, are products of the West.\"\r\n\r\nBut it is the word Imperialism which more especially excites Mr.\r\nMallik's wrath. In the first place, he altogether denies the existence\r\nof an \"imperial race,\" being convinced of its non-existence by the\r\nstrangely inconclusive argument that \"if a race is made by nature\r\nimperial, every member of that race must be imperial too and equally\r\nable to rule.\" In the second place, he points out that the results which\r\nflow from the Imperial idea are in all respects deplorable. The East had\r\n\"always believed that mankind could be made saints and philosophers,\"\r\nbut the West, represented by Imperialism, stepped in and \"shattered its\r\nbelief.\" The West, as shown by the deference now paid to Japan, \"values\r\nthe bloodthirsty propensities much more than humane activities.\" \"The\r\nexpressed desire of the Imperialist is to let darkness flourish in order\r\nthat he may personally benefit by it.... Empire and Imperialism mean\r\nthe triumph of retrograde notions and the infliction of insult and\r\nsuffering on three hundred millions of human beings.\" It is this\r\nImperial policy which has led to the most gross injustice being\r\ninflicted on every class of the community in India. As regards the civil\r\nservices, \"the policy of fat pay, ease, perquisites, and praise are the\r\nshare of the European officers, and hard work and blame that of the\r\nIndian rank and file.\" It is the same in the army. \"In frontier wars the\r\nIndian troops have had to bear the brunt of the fighting, the European\r\nportion being 'held in reserve' and coming up at the end to receive all\r\nthe glory of victory and the consequent rewards.\" It is sometimes said\r\nthat the masses in India trust Englishmen more than their own\r\ncountrymen. That this statement is erroneous is clearly proved by \"the\r\nabsence of interest of the rulers themselves in the moral and material\r\nadvancement of the poorer classes.\" Not content with uttering this\r\nprodigious falsehood, Mr. Mallik adds a further and fouler calumny. He\r\nalludes to the rudeness at times displayed by Englishmen towards the\r\nnatives of India--a feature in Indian social life which every\r\nright-thinking Englishman will be prepared to condemn as strongly as Mr.\r\nMallik. But, not content with indicating the evil, Mr. Mallik alleges\r\nthat any special act of insolence perpetrated by an Indian official\r\nmeets with the warm approval of the Government. Promotion, he says, is\r\n\"usual in such cases.\" Again, Mr. Mallik's dislike and distrust of\r\nMoslems crops up whenever he alludes to them. Nevertheless, he does not\r\nhesitate to denounce that Government whose presence alone prevents an\r\noutbreak of sectarian strife for \"sedulously fomenting\" religious\r\nanimosities with a view to arresting the Nationalist movement.\r\nSimilarly, the constitution of the Universities has been changed with a\r\nview to rendering the youth of India \"stupid and servile\" instead of\r\n\"clever and patriotic.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, whilst India, under the sway of Imperialism, is \"drifting to\r\nits doom,\" Mr. Mallik seems to fear that a somewhat similar fate awaits\r\nEngland. He observes many symptoms of decay to which, for the most part,\r\nEnglishmen are blind. He greatly fears that \"the liberties of the people\r\nare not safe when the Tory Party continues in power for a long period.\"\r\nNeither is the prospect of Liberal ascendancy much less gloomy. Liberals\r\nare becoming \"Easternised.\" They are getting \"more and more leavened by\r\nreaction imported from India.\" It really looks as if \"English Liberalism\r\nmight soon sink to a pious tradition.\" In the meanwhile, Mr. Mallik,\r\nwith true Eastern proclivities, warmly admires that portion of the\r\nEnglish system which Englishmen generally tolerate as a necessary evil,\r\nbut of which they are by no means proud. Most thinking men in this\r\ncountry resent the idea of Indian interests being made a shuttlecock in\r\nthe strife of party. Not so Mr. Mallik. He shudders at the idea of\r\nIndian affairs being considered exclusively on their own merits. \"If it\r\nis no party's duty to champion the cause of any part of the Empire, that\r\npart must be made over to Satan, or retained, like a convict settlement,\r\nfor the breeding of 'Imperial' ideas.\" He is himself quite prepared to\r\nadopt an ultra-partisan attitude. In spite of his evident dislike to the\r\nnomination of any Englishman to take part in the administration of\r\nIndia, he warmly applauds the appointment of \"a young and able official\"\r\nto the Viceroy's Council, because he was \"associated with a great\r\nLiberal Minister of the Crown.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not quite clear what, beyond a manifestation of that sympathy\r\nwhich his own writings are so well calculated to alienate, Mr. Mallik\r\nreally wants. He thinks that there is \"perhaps some truth\" in the\r\nassertion that the \"Aryans of India are not yet fit for\r\nself-government,\" and he says that \"wise Indians do not claim at once\r\nthe political institutions that Europeans have gained by a long course\r\nof struggle and training, the value of which in advancing happiness is\r\nnot yet always perceptible in Europe.\" On the other hand, he appears to\r\nbe of opinion that the somewhat sweeping reforms recently inaugurated by\r\nLord Morley and Lord Minto do not go far enough. The only practical\r\nproposals he makes are, first, that the old _punchayet_ system in every\r\nvillage should be revived, and that a consultative assembly should be\r\ncreated, whose functions \"should be wholly social and religious,\r\npolitical topics being out of its jurisdiction.\" He adds--and there need\r\nbe no hesitation in cordially accepting his view on this point--that the\r\n\"plan would have to be carefully thought out\" before it is adopted.\r\n\r\nThe problem of how to govern India is very difficult, and is\r\nunquestionably becoming more and more so every year. Although many of\r\nthe slanders uttered by Mr. Mallik are very contemptible, it is useless\r\nto ignore the fact that they are believed not only by a large number of\r\nthe educated youth of India, of which he may perhaps to some extent be\r\nconsidered a type, but also by many of their English sympathisers.\r\nMoreover, in spite of much culpable misstatement and exaggeration, Mr.\r\nMallik may have occasionally blundered unawares into making some\r\nobservations which are deserving of some slight consideration on their\r\nown merits. The only wise course for English statesmen to adopt is to\r\npossess their souls in patience, to continue to govern India in the best\r\ninterests of its inhabitants, and to avoid on the one hand the extreme\r\nof repressive measures, and on the other hand the equally dangerous\r\nextreme of premature and drastic reform in the fundamental institutions\r\nof the country. In the meanwhile, it may be noted that literature such\r\nas Mr. Mallik's book can do no good, and may do much harm.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: _Orient and Occident_. By Manmath C. Mallik. London: T.\r\nFisher Unwin. 10s. 6d.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nTHE FISCAL QUESTION IN INDIA\r\n\r\n_\"The Spectator,\" July 19, 1913_\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Roper Lethbridge says that his object in writing the book which he\r\nhas recently published (_The Indian Offer of Imperial Preference_) is to\r\nprovoke discussion, but \"not to lay down any dogma.\" It is related that\r\na certain clergyman, after he had preached a sermon, said to Lord\r\nMelbourne, who had been one of his congregation, \"I tried not to be\r\ntedious,\" to which Lord Melbourne replied, \"You were.\" Sir Roper\r\nLethbridge may have tried not to dogmatise, but his efforts in this\r\ndirection have certainly not been crowned with success. On the contrary,\r\nalthough dealing with a subject which bristles with points of a highly\r\ncontroversial nature, he states his conclusions with an assurance which\r\nis little short of oracular. Heedless of the woful fate which has\r\nattended many of the fiscal seers who have preceded him, he does not\r\nhesitate to pronounce the most confident prophecies upon a subject as to\r\nwhich experience has proved that prophecy is eminently hazardous, viz.\r\nthe economic effect likely to be produced by drastic changes in the\r\nfiscal system. Moreover, his pages are disfigured by a good deal of\r\ncommonplace invective about \"the shibboleths of an obsolete Cobdenism,\"\r\nthe \"worship of the fetish of Cobdenism,\" and \"the bigotry of the Cobden\r\nClub,\" as to whom the stale fallacy is repeated that they \"consider the\r\nwell-being of the 'poor foreigner'\" rather than \"our own commercial\r\ninterests.\" Language of this sort can only serve to irritate. It cannot\r\nconvince. Sir Roper Lethbridge appears to forget that, apart from those\r\nwho, on general party grounds, are little inclined to listen to the\r\ngospel which he has to preach, there are a large number of Unionists who\r\nare to a greater extent open to conviction, and who, if their conversion\r\ncan be effected, are, in the interests of the cause which he advocates,\r\nwell worth convincing. These blemishes--for blemishes they\r\nunquestionably are--should not, however, blind us to the fact that Sir\r\nRoper Lethbridge deals with a subject of very great importance and also\r\nof very great difficulty. It is most desirable that it should be\r\ndiscussed. Sir Fleetwood Wilson, in the very statesmanlike speech\r\ndelivered in the Indian Legislative Council last March, indicated the\r\nspirit in which the discussion should take place. \"The subject,\" he\r\nsaid, \"is one which in the public interest calls for consideration, not\r\nrecrimination.\" It would be Utopian to suppose that it can be kept\r\naltogether outside the arena of party strife, but those who are not\r\nuncompromising partisans, and who also strongly deprecate Indian\r\nquestions being made the shuttlecock of party interests, can at all\r\nevents endeavour to approach the question with an open mind and to treat\r\nit dispassionately and exclusively on its own merits.\r\n\r\nThe main issue involved may be broadly stated in the following terms. Up\r\nto the present time the fiscal policy of the Indian Government has been\r\nbased on Free Trade principles. Customs duties are collected for revenue\r\npurposes. A general 5 per cent _ad valorem_ duty is imposed on imports.\r\nCotton goods pay a duty of 3½ per cent. An excise duty of a similar\r\namount is imposed on cotton woven at Indian mills. A duty of three annas\r\na maund is paid on exported rice. Sir Roper Lethbridge and those who\r\nconcur with him now propose that this system should undergo a radical\r\nchange. The main features of their proposal, if the writer of the\r\npresent article understands them correctly, seem to be that the duty on\r\ncotton goods imported from the United Kingdom, as also the\r\ncorresponding excise duty levied in India, should be altogether\r\nabolished; that the duties raised on goods--apparently of all\r\ndescriptions--imported into India from non-British ports should be\r\nraised; that a preference should be accorded in British ports to Indian\r\ntea, coffee, sugar, tobacco, etc.; and that an export duty should be\r\nlevied at Indian ports on certain products, notably on jute and lac.\r\nThis new duty would not, however, be levied on goods sent to the United\r\nKingdom.\r\n\r\nThere does not appear to be any absolute necessity for dealing with this\r\nquestion at once, but Sir Roper Lethbridge is quite justified in calling\r\nattention to it, for it is not only conceivable, but even probable, that\r\nat no very remote period the Government of India will have to deal with\r\na problem which, it may readily be admitted, will tax their\r\nstatesmanship to the very utmost. It is no exaggeration to say that\r\nsince the Crown took over the direct management of Indian affairs no\r\nissue of greater magnitude has been raised. Moreover, although Lord\r\nCrewe had an easy task in showing that in some respects the difficulties\r\nattendant on any solution would be enhanced rather than diminished if\r\nthe fiscal policy of the British Government in the United Kingdom\r\nunderwent a radical change, it is none the less true that those\r\ndifficulties will remain of a very formidable character even if no such\r\nchange is effected.\r\n\r\nIt is essential to bear in mind that the difficulties which beset this\r\nquestion are not solely fiscal, but also political. This feature is\r\nalmost invariably characteristic of Oriental finance, and nowhere is it\r\nmore prominent than in India. The writer of the present article can\r\nspeak with some special knowledge of the circumstances attendant on the\r\ngreat Free Trade measures introduced in India under the auspices of Lord\r\nRipon. He can state very confidently that, although Lord Ripon and all\r\nthe leading members of his Government were convinced Free Traders, it\r\nwas the political to a far greater extent than the fiscal arguments\r\nwhich led them to the conclusion that the Indian Customs barriers should\r\nbe abolished. They foresaw that the rival commercial interests of India\r\nand Lancashire would cause a rankling and persistent sore which might do\r\ninfinite political harm. They wished, therefore, to apply a timely\r\nremedy, and it cannot be doubted that, so long as it lasted, the remedy\r\nwas effective. In most respects the fiscal policy adopted then and that\r\nnow advocated by Sir Roper Lethbridge and his coadjutors are the poles\r\nasunder. Nevertheless, in one respect they coincide. Sir Roper\r\nLethbridge places in the forefront of his proposals the abolition both\r\nof the import duty on cotton goods and the corresponding excise duty\r\nlevied in India. He is unquestionably right. That is an ideal which both\r\nFree Traders and Protectionists may very reasonably seek to attain. It\r\nis, in fact, the only really satisfactory solution of the main point at\r\nissue. The difficulty is to realise this ideal without doing more than\r\nan equivalent amount of injury to Indian interests in other directions.\r\n\r\nThe chief arguments by which Sir Roper Lethbridge defends the special\r\nproposals which he advances are three in number. They are (1) that the\r\nnascent industries of India require protection; (2) that it is necessary\r\nto raise more revenue, and that the suggestions now made afford an\r\nunobjectionable method for achieving this object; and (3) that the\r\neconomic facts connected with India afford special facilities for the\r\nadoption of a policy of retaliation.\r\n\r\nFrom a purely economic point of view the first of these three pleas is\r\nsingularly inconclusive.\r\n\r\nIt was refuted by Sir Fleetwood Wilson, whom both Mr. Austen\r\nChamberlain, in the introduction which he has written to Sir Roper\r\nLethbridge's book, and Sir Roper Lethbridge himself seem to regard, on\r\ngrounds which are apparently somewhat insufficient, as a partial convert\r\nto their views. It may be said without exaggeration that if any country\r\nin the world is likely to benefit by the adoption of Free Trade\r\nprinciples that country is India. Industries cannot, as Sir Fleetwood\r\nWilson very truly said, be \"encouraged\" by means of a protective tariff\r\nwithout raising home prices. Without going over all the well-trodden\r\nground on this subject, which must be familiar to all who have taken\r\npart in the fiscal controversy, and without, moreover, denying that\r\nnascent industries have in some countries been successfully encouraged\r\nby the adoption of a protective system, it will be sufficient to say\r\nthat, looking at all the economic facts existent in India, the period of\r\npartial transition from agriculture to industries, during which the\r\nprocess of encouragement will have to be maintained, will almost\r\ncertainly last much longer than even in America or Germany, and that\r\nduring the whole of that lengthy period the mass of the population, who\r\nare very poor and who are engaged in agricultural pursuits, will not\r\nbenefit from the protection, although they will at the same time suffer\r\ngrievously from the rise in prices.\r\n\r\nThe main importance of this argument, however, is not to be derived from\r\nits economic value, but rather from the important political fact that it\r\nis one which finds favour with a large and influential body of Indian\r\nopinion. Sir Roper Lethbridge claims that the leaders of Indian thought\r\nare almost to a man Protectionists, and in his work he gives, as an\r\nexample of their views, the very able speech delivered by Sir Gangadhar\r\nChitnavis in the Calcutta Legislative Council last March.[96] He is\r\nprobably right; neither is anything to be gained by ignoring the gravity\r\nof the situation which is thus created. Whether the Indian\r\nProtectionists be right or wrong as to the fiscal policy which is best\r\nadapted to Indian interests, there is no denying the fact that with\r\nProtection flourishing in the self-governing colonies, with the recent\r\nenlargement of the scope and functions of representative institutions in\r\nIndia, and with the grievance created by the sacrifice of the opium\r\nrevenue on the altar of British vicarious philanthropy, it is a serious\r\nmatter for the British Government to assert their own views if those\r\nviews run diametrically counter to the wishes expressed by the only\r\nrepresentatives of Indian opinion who are in a position to make their\r\nvoices heard. Nevertheless, there are two limitations on the extent to\r\nwhich concessions can or ought to be made to Indian opinion. The first\r\nis based on the necessities of English internal politics. It cannot be\r\ndoubted that although Sir Gangadhar Chitnavis and those who agree with\r\nhim may perhaps be willing, as a _pis aller_, to accept Sir Roper\r\nLethbridge's preferential plan, what they really want is not Preference\r\nbut Protection against England, and this they cannot have, because, in\r\nSir Roper Lethbridge's words, \"no British Government that offered India\r\nProtection against Lancashire would live for a week.\" The second\r\nlimitation is based on less egotistical and, therefore, nobler grounds.\r\nIn spite of recent concessions, India is still, politically speaking,\r\n_in statu pupillari_, neither do the concessions recently made in the\r\ndirection of granting self-governing institutions dispense the British\r\nGovernment from the duty of looking to the interests of the masses, who\r\nare at present very inadequately represented. It must be remembered that\r\nin India, perhaps even more than elsewhere, the voice of the consumer is\r\nhushed, whilst that of the producer is loud and strident.\r\n\r\nThe second of Sir Roper Lethbridge's arguments is based on the alleged\r\nnecessity of raising more revenue. He, as also Sir Gangadhar Chitnavis,\r\ntake it for granted that this necessity has already arisen. It would be\r\nessential, before taking any practical steps to give effect to the\r\nproposals now under discussion, to ascertain beyond any manner of doubt\r\nwhether this statement is correct, and also, if correct, what\r\nalternatives exist to the plan proposed by Sir Roper Lethbridge. Sir\r\nFleetwood Wilson carefully abstained from pledging himself to the\r\naccuracy of Sir Gangadhar Chitnavis's view on this point. \"There is,\" he\r\nsaid, \"much room for the development of India's other resources, and it\r\nhas yet to be shown that there is no room for further economies in our\r\nadministration.\" In the meanwhile, it would tend to the elucidation of\r\nthe subject if Sir Roper Lethbridge and those who agree with him would\r\nlay before the world a carefully prepared and detailed estimate of the\r\nfinancial results which they consider would accrue from the adoption of\r\ntheir proposals. We are told, for instance, that raw jute to the value\r\nof £13,000,000 is exported annually from Bengal, of which only\r\n£3,000,000 worth is worked up in Great Britain, and that \"a moderate\r\nduty\" on this article would produce two millions a year. The prospect of\r\nobtaining a revenue of £2,000,000 in the manner proposed by Sir Roper\r\nLethbridge appears at first sight somewhat illusory. In the first place,\r\nthe tax would, on the basis of Sir Roper Lethbridge's figures, amount to\r\n20 per cent, which can scarcely be called \"moderate.\" In the second\r\nplace, unless an equivalent export duty were imposed at British ports\r\nit would appear probable that the process of re-export for the benefit\r\nof \"the lucky artisans of foreign protected nations\" would not merely\r\ncontinue unchecked, but would even be encouraged, for those artisans\r\nwould certainly not be supplied direct from India with the duty-laden\r\nraw material, but would draw their supplies from the jute sent to the\r\nports of the United Kingdom, which would have paid no duty. Is it,\r\nmoreover, quite certain that a duty such as that proposed by Sir Roper\r\nLethbridge would be insufficient, as he alleges, \"to bring in any\r\ncompeting fibres in the world\"? These and other cognate points\r\nmanifestly require further elucidation.\r\n\r\nThe third argument adduced by Sir Roper Lethbridge is based on the\r\nallegation that India is in a specially favourable position to adopt a\r\npolicy of retaliation. It is unnecessary to go into the general\r\narguments for and against retaliatory duties. They have been exhausted\r\nin the very remarkable and frigidly impartial book written on this\r\nsubject by Professor Dietzel. It will be sufficient to say that here Sir\r\nRoper Lethbridge is on stronger ground. The main argument against\r\nretaliation in the United Kingdom is that foreign nations, by stopping\r\nour supplies of raw material, could check our manufactures. We are,\r\ntherefore, in a singularly unfavourable position for engaging in a\r\ntariff war. The case of India is wholly different. Foreign nations\r\ncannot, it is alleged, dispense with the raw material which India\r\nsupplies. There is, therefore, a good _prima facie_ case for supposing\r\nthat India has relatively little to fear from retaliation on their part.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible within the limits of the present article to deal\r\nfully with all the aspects of this vitally important question. Attention\r\nmay, however, be drawn to the very weighty remarks of Sir Fleetwood\r\nWilson when he speaks of \"the great alteration which a tariff war in\r\nIndia would effect in the balance of our trade, in the arrangements that\r\nnow exist for the payment of our external debt, and in the whole of our\r\nexchange policy. This aspect of the question is one of extraordinary\r\ncomplexity, as well as of no small speculation.\" On the whole, although\r\nthe proposals made by Sir Roper Lethbridge and his associates deserve\r\nfull and fair consideration, it is most earnestly to be hoped that party\r\nleaders in this country will insist on their elaboration in full detail,\r\nand will then study every aspect of the question with the utmost care\r\nbefore giving even a qualified pledge to afford them support. The\r\nsituation is already sufficiently difficult and complicated. It is not\r\nimprobable that the difficulties and complications, far from being\r\nmitigated, would be increased by the pursuit into the economic\r\nwilderness of the _ignis fatuus_ involved in the idea that it is\r\npossible for a nation to impose a tax on itself and then make the\r\ninhabitants of other countries pay the whole or the greater part of it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: It may be noted that Sir Gangadhar Chitnavis's idea of\r\nPreference differs widely from that entertained by Sir Roper Lethbridge.\r\nThe former apparently wishes to abolish the excise duty on Indian cotton\r\ngoods, but to maintain that levied on similar goods imported from the\r\nUnited Kingdom, whilst levying a still higher duty on goods from other\r\ncountries.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nROME AND MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT[97]\r\n\r\n_\"The Spectator,\" July 19, 1913_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of the obvious danger of establishing doubtful analogies and of\r\nmaking insufficient allowance for differences, the history of Imperial\r\nRome can never cease to be of more than academic interest to the\r\nstatesmen and politicians of Imperial England. Rome bequeathed to us\r\nmuch that is of inestimable value, both in the way of precept and\r\nexample. She also bequeathed to us a word of ill omen--the word\r\n\"Imperialism.\" The attempt to embody the broad outlines of a policy in a\r\nsingle word or phrase has at times exercised great influence in deciding\r\nthe fate of nations. M. Vandal[98] says with truth, \"Nul ne comprendra\r\nla Révolution s'il ne tient compte de l'extraordinaire empire exercé à\r\ncette époque par les mots et les formules.\" Imperialism, though\r\ninfinitely preferable to its quasi-synonym Caesarism, is, in fact, a\r\nterm which, although not absolutely incorrect, is at the same time, by\r\nreason of its historical associations, misleading when applied to the\r\nmild and beneficent hegemony exercised by the rulers and people of\r\nEngland over their scattered transmarine dominions. It affords a\r\nconvenient peg on which hostile critics, such as Mr. Mallik, whose work\r\nwas reviewed last week in these columns,[99] as also those\r\nultra-cosmopolitan Englishmen who are the friends of every country but\r\ntheir own, may hang partisan homilies dwelling on the brutality of\r\nconquest and on all the harsh features of alien rule, whilst they leave\r\nsedulously in the background that aspect of the case which Polybius,\r\nparodying a famous saying of Themistocles, embodied in a phrase which he\r\nattributes to the Greeks after they had been absorbed into the Roman\r\nEmpire, \"If we had not been quickly ruined, we should not have been\r\nsaved.\" This pessimistic aspect of Imperialism has certainly to some\r\nextent an historical basis. It is founded on the procedure generally\r\nbelieved to have been adopted in the process by which Rome acquired the\r\ndominion of the world. The careful attention given of late years to the\r\nstudy of inscriptions, and generally the results obtained by the\r\nco-operation established between historians and those who have more\r\nespecially studied other branches of science, such as archaeology,\r\nepigraphy, and numismatics, have, however, now enabled us to approach\r\nthe question of Roman expansion with far greater advantages than those\r\npossessed by writers even so late as the days of Mommsen. We are able to\r\nreply with a greater degree of confidence than at any previous period to\r\nthe question of how far Roman policy was really associated with those\r\nprinciples and practices which many are accustomed to designate as\r\nImperial. The valuable and erudite work which Mr. Reid has now given to\r\nthe world comes opportunely to remind us of a very obvious and\r\ncommonplace consideration. It is that although Roman expansion not only\r\nbegan, but was far advanced during the days of the Republic, Roman\r\nImperialism did not exist before the creation of Roman Emperors, and did\r\nnot in any considerable degree develop the vices generally, and\r\nsometimes rightly, attributed to the system until some while after\r\nRepublican had given way to Imperial sway. \"The residuary impression of\r\nthe ancient world,\" Mr. Reid says in his preface, \"left by a classical\r\neducation comprises commonly the idea that the Romans ran, so to speak,\r\na sort of political steam-roller over the ancient world. This has a\r\nsemblance of truth for the period of decline, but none for the earlier\r\ndays.\"\r\n\r\nThe fundamental idea which ran through the whole of Roman policy during\r\nthe earliest, which was also the wisest and most statesmanlike stage of\r\nexpansion, was not any desire to ensure the detailed and direct\r\ngovernment of a number of outlying districts from one all-powerful\r\ncentre, but rather to adopt every possible means calculated to maintain\r\nlocal autonomy, and to minimise the interference of the central\r\nauthority. Herself originally a city-state, Rome aspired to become the\r\npredominant partner in a federation of municipalities, to which autonomy\r\nwas granted even to the extent of waiving that prerogative which has\r\ngenerally been considered the distinctive mark of sovereignty, viz. the\r\nright of coinage. Broadly speaking, the only conditions imposed were\r\nvery similar to those now forming the basis of the relations between the\r\nBritish Government and the Native States of India. These were (1) that\r\nthe various commonwealths should keep the peace between each other; and\r\n(2) that their foreign policy should be dictated by Rome. It is often\r\ntacitly assumed, Mr. Reid says, that \"in dealing with conquered peoples,\r\nthe Romans were animated from the first by a passion for immediate\r\ndomination and for grinding uniformity.\" This idea is not merely false;\r\nit is the very reverse of the truth. The most distinctive feature of\r\nRoman rule during the early period of expansion was its marvellous\r\nelasticity and pliability. Everywhere local customs were scrupulously\r\nrespected. Everywhere the maintenance of whatever autonomous\r\ninstitutions existed at the time of conquest was secured. Everywhere the\r\nallies were treated with what the Greeks termed ἐπιμέλεια, which may be\r\nrendered into English by the word \"consideration.\" Nowhere was the fatal\r\nmistake made of endeavouring to stamp out by force a local language or\r\ndialect, whilst until the Romans were brought into contact with the\r\nstubborn monotheism of the Jews, the easy-going pantheistic ideas\r\ncurrent in the ancient world readily obviated the occurrence of any\r\nserious difficulties based on religious belief or ritual.\r\n\r\nThat this system produced results which were, from a political point of\r\nview, eminently satisfactory cannot for a moment be doubted. Mr. Reid\r\nsays--and it were well that those who are interested in the cause of\r\nBritish Imperial Federation should note the remark--\"In history the\r\nlightest bonds have often proved to be the strongest.\" The loosely\r\ncompacted alliance of the Italic states withstood all the efforts of\r\nHannibal to rend it asunder. The Roman system, in fact, created a double\r\npatriotism, that which attached itself to the locality, and that which\r\nbroadened out into devotion to the metropolis. Neither was the one\r\nallegiance destructive of the other. When Ennius made his famous boast\r\nhe did not mean that he spurned Rudiae and that he would for the future\r\nlook exclusively to Rome as his mother-country, but rather that both the\r\nsmaller and the larger patriotism would continue to exist side by side.\r\n\"English local life,\" it has been truly said, \"was the source and\r\nsafeguard of English liberty.\"[100] It may be said with equal truth that\r\nthe notion of constituting self-governing town communities as the basis\r\nof Empire, which, Mr. Reid tells us, \"was deeply ingrained in the Roman\r\nconsciousness,\" stood Rome in good stead during some of the most stormy\r\nperiods of her history. The process of voluntary Romanisation was so\r\nspeedy that the natives of any province which, to use the Roman\r\nexpression, had been but recently \"pacated,\" became in a very short time\r\nloyal and zealous Roman subjects, and rarely if ever took advantage of\r\ndistress elsewhere to vindicate their independence by seeking to cast\r\noff the light shackles which had been imposed on them.\r\n\r\n\"So long as municipal liberty maintained its vigour, the empire\r\nflourished.\" This is the fundamental fact to be borne in mind in\r\ndealing with the history of Roman expansion. Mr. Reid then takes us,\r\nstep by step and province by province, through the pitiful history of\r\nsubsequent deterioration and decay. After the Hannibalic war, Roman\r\nhegemony in Italy began to pass into domination. A policy of unwise\r\nexclusion applied to the federated states and cities, coupled with the\r\nassertion of irritating privileges on behalf of Roman citizens, led to\r\nthe cataclysm of the Great Social War, at the close of which burgess\r\nrights were reluctantly conceded to all Italic communities who had not\r\njoined the rebels. Then followed the era of the great Julius, who\r\nprobably--though of this we cannot be quite certain--wished to create a\r\n\"world-state\" with Rome as its head; Augustus, to whose genius and\r\nadministrative ability tardy justice is now being done, and who, albeit\r\nhe continued the policy of his uncle, possibly leant rather more to the\r\nidea, realised eighteen centuries later by Cavour, of a united Italy;\r\nAdrian, who aimed above all things at the consolidation of the Empire;\r\nand many others. Consolidation in whatsoever form almost necessarily\r\nconnoted the insistence on some degree of uniformity, and \"when the\r\nEmperors pressed uniformity upon the imperial system, it rapidly went to\r\npieces.\" Finally, we get to the stage of Imperial penury and\r\nextravagance, accompanied by centralisation _in extremis_, when \"hordes\r\nof official locusts, military and civil,\" were let loose on the land,\r\nand the tax-gatherers destroyed the main sources of the public revenues,\r\nwith the result that the tax-payers were utterly ruined. The municipal\r\nsystem possessed wonderful vitality, and displayed remarkable aptitude\r\nfor offering a passive resistance to the attacks directed against it. It\r\nsurvived longer than might have been expected. But when it became clear\r\nthat the only function which the _curiales_ were expected to perform was\r\nto emulate the Danaides by pouring gold into the bottomless cask of the\r\nImperial Treasury,[101] they naturally rejected the dubious honours\r\nconferred on them, and fled either to be the companions of the monks in\r\nthe desert or elsewhere so as to be safe from the crushing load of\r\nImperial distinction. Mr. Hodgkin and others have pointed out that the\r\ndiversion of local funds to the Imperial Exchequer was one of the\r\nproximate causes which led to the downfall of the empire. Whilst the\r\nmunicipal system lasted, it produced admirable results. Dealing with\r\nNorthern Africa, whose progress was eventually arrested by the withering\r\nhand of Islam, Mr. Reid speaks of \"the contrast between the Roman\r\ncivilisation and the culture which exists in the same regions to-day;\r\nflourishing cities, villages, and farms abounded in districts which are\r\nnow sterile and deserted.\"\r\n\r\nApart from the special causes to which Mr. Reid and other historians\r\nhave alluded, and apart, moreover, from the intentions--often the very\r\nwise intentions--of individual Emperors, the municipal system, and with\r\nit the principle that local affairs should be dealt with locally, was\r\nalmost bound to founder directly the force of circumstances strengthened\r\nthe hands of the central authority at Rome. The battle between\r\ncentralisation and decentralisation still continues. Every one who has\r\nbeen engaged in it knows that, whatever be the system adopted, the\r\nspirit in which it is carried out counts for even more than the system\r\nitself. Once place a firm, self-confident man with the centralising\r\nspirit strong within him at the head of affairs, and he will often,\r\nwithout any apparent change, go far to shatter any system, however\r\ncarefully it may have been devised, to encourage decentralisation. Such\r\na man was Napoleon. Every conceivable subject bearing on the government\r\nof his fellow-men was, as M. Taine says, \"classified and docketed\" in\r\nhis ultra-methodical brain. It is useless to ask a man of this sort to\r\ndecentralise. He cannot do so, not always by reason of a deliberate wish\r\nto grasp at absolute power, but because he sees so clearly what he\r\nthinks should be done that he cannot tolerate the local ineptitude, as\r\nhe considers it, that leads to the rejection of his views. Thus, whilst\r\nNapoleon said to Count Chaptal, \"Ce n'est pas des Tuileries qu'on peut\r\ndiriger une armée,\" at the same time, as a matter of fact, he never\r\nceased to interfere with the action of his generals employed at a\r\ndistance, with results which, especially in Spain, were generally\r\ndisastrous to French arms. Another general cause which militates against\r\ndecentralisation is the inevitable tendency of any disputant who is\r\ndissatisfied with a decision given locally to seek redress at the hands\r\nof the central authority. St. Paul appealed to Caesar. A discontented\r\nRajah will appeal to the Secretary of State for India. It is certain\r\nthat in these cases, unless the appellate authority acts with the\r\ngreatest circumspection, a risk will be incurred of giving a severe blow\r\nto the fundamental principles of decentralisation. It is no very\r\nhazardous conjecture to assume that many of the Roman Emperors were,\r\nlike Napoleon, constitutionally disposed to centralise, and that the\r\ngreater their ability the more likely was this disposition to dominate\r\ntheir minds. Thus Tacitus, speaking of Tiberius, says, \"He never relaxed\r\nfrom the cares of government, but derived relief from his\r\noccupations.\"[102] A man of this temperament is a born centraliser.\r\nHowever much his reason or his statesmanship may hold him in check, he\r\nwill probably sooner or later yield to the temptation of stretching his\r\nown authority to such an extent as materially to weaken that of his\r\ndistant and subordinate agents.\r\n\r\nConsiderations of space preclude the possibility of dwelling any further\r\non the many points of interest suggested by Mr. Reid's instructive work.\r\nThis much, however, may be said, that whilst British Imperialism is not\r\nexposed to many of the dangers which proved fatal to Imperial Rome,\r\nthere is one principle adopted by the early founders of the Roman Empire\r\nwhich is fraught with enduring political wisdom, and which may be\r\napplied as well now as it was nineteen centuries ago. That principle is\r\nthe preference shown to diversity over uniformity of system. Sir Alfred\r\nLyall, whose receptive intellect was impregnated with modern\r\napplications of ancient precedents, said, \"We ought to acknowledge that\r\nwe cannot impose a uniform type of civilisation.\" Let us beware that we\r\ndo not violate this very sound principle by too eager a disposition to\r\ntransport institutions, whose natural habitat is Westminster, to\r\nCalcutta or Cairo.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: _The Municipalities of the Roman Empire_.

One is that there is not the\r\nsmallest sign either of relaxation in the quantity or deterioration in\r\nthe quality of the humanistic literature turned out from our seats of\r\nlearning. Year by year, indeed, both the interest in classical studies\r\nand the standard of scholarship appear to rise to a higher level. The\r\nother is that the mere fact that humanistic works are supplied shows\r\nthat there must be a demand for them, and that there exists amongst the\r\ngeneral public a number of readers outside the ranks of scholars,\r\nproperly so called, who are anxious and willing to acquaint themselves\r\nwith whatever new lights assiduous research can throw on the sayings and\r\ndoings of the ancient world. Archaeology, epigraphy, and numismatics are\r\nyear by year opening out new fields for inquiry, and affording fresh\r\nmaterial for the reconstruction of history. More especially much light\r\nhas of late been thrown on that chaotic period which lies between the\r\ndeath of the Macedonian conqueror and the final assertion of Roman\r\ndomination. Professor Mahaffy has dealt with the Ptolemies, and Mr.\r\nBevan with the Seleucids. A welcome complement to these instructive\r\nworks is now furnished by Mr. Tarn's comprehensive treatment of an\r\nimportant chapter in the history of the Antigonids. It is surely the\r\nirony of posthumous fame that whereas every schoolboy knows something\r\nabout Pyrrhus--how he fought the Romans with elephants, and eventually\r\nmet a somewhat ignoble death from the hand of an old Argive woman who\r\ndropped a tile on his head--but few outside the ranks of historical\r\nstudents probably know anything of his great rival and relative,\r\nAntigonus Gonatas, the son of Demetrius the Besieger. Yet there can in\r\nreality be no manner of doubt as to which of these two careers should\r\nmore excite the interest of posterity. Pyrrhus made a great stir in the\r\nworld whilst he lived. \"He thought it,\" Plutarch says--we quote from\r\nDryden's translation--\"a nauseous course of life not to be doing\r\nmischief to others or receiving some from them.\" But he was in reality\r\nan unlettered soldier of fortune, probably very much of the same type as\r\nsome of Napoleon's rougher marshals, such as Augereau or Masséna. His\r\nmanners were those of the camp, and his statesmanship that of the\r\nbarrack-room. He blundered in everything he undertook except in the\r\nactual management of troops on the field of battle. \"Not a common\r\nsoldier in his army,\" Mr. Tarn says, \"could have managed things as badly\r\nas the brilliant Pyrrhus.\" Antigonus was a man of a very different type.\r\n\"He was the one monarch before Marcus Aurelius whom philosophy could\r\ndefinitely claim as her own.\" But in forming an estimate of his\r\ncharacter it is necessary to bear constantly in mind the many different\r\nconstructions which in the course of ages have been placed on the term\r\n\"philosophy.\" Antigonus, albeit a disciple of Zeno, the most unpractical\r\nidealist of his age, was himself eminently practical. He indulged in no\r\nsuch hallucinations as those which cost the Egyptian Akhnaton his Syrian\r\nkingdom. As a thinker he moved on a distinctly lower plane than Marcus\r\nAurelius. Perhaps of all the characters of antiquity he most resembles\r\nJulian, whose career as a man of action wrung from the Christian\r\nPrudentius the fine epitaph, \"Perfidus ille Deo, quamvis non perfidus\r\norbi.\" These early Greek philosophers were, in fact, a strange set of\r\nmen. They were not always engaged in the study of philosophy. They\r\noccasionally, whilst pursuing knowledge and wisdom, indulged in\r\npractices of singular unwisdom or of very dubious morality. Thus the\r\neminent historian Hieronymus endeavoured to establish what we should now\r\ncall a \"corner\" in the bitumen which floated on the surface of the Dead\r\nSea, and which was largely used for purposes of embalming in Egypt; but\r\nhis efforts were completely frustrated by the Arabs who were interested\r\nin the local trade. The philosopher Lycon, besides displaying an\r\nexcessive love for the pleasures of the table, was a noted wrestler,\r\nboxer, and tennis-player. Antigonus himself, in spite of his love of\r\nlearning, vied with his great predecessors, Philip and Alexander, in his\r\naddiction to the wine-cup. When, by a somewhat unworthy stratagem, he\r\nhad tricked the widowed queen Nikaia out of the possession of the\r\nAcrocorinthian citadel, which was, politically speaking, the apple of\r\nhis eye, he celebrated the occasion by getting exceedingly drunk, and\r\nwent \"reeling through Corinth at the head of a drunken rout, a garland\r\non his head and a wine-cup in his hand.\" Antigonus was, in fact, not so\r\nmuch what we should call a philosopher as a man of action with literary\r\ntastes, standing thus in marked contrast to Pyrrhus, who \"cared as\r\nlittle for knowledge or culture as did any baron of the Dark Ages.\" When\r\nhe was engaged in a difficult negotiation with Ptolemy Philadelphus he\r\nallowed himself to be mollified by a quotation from Homer, who, as Plato\r\nsaid, was \"the educator of Hellas.\" Although not himself an original\r\nthinker, he encouraged thought in others. He surrounded himself with men\r\nof learning, and even received at his court the yellow-robed envoys of\r\nAsoka, the far-distant ruler and religious reformer of India. Moreover,\r\nin spite of his wholly practical turn of mind, Antigonus learnt\r\nsomething from his philosophic friends; notably, he imbibed somewhat of\r\nthe Stoic sense of duty. \"Do you not understand,\" he said to his son,\r\nwho had misused some of his subjects, \"that _our_ kingship is a noble\r\nservitude?\" Nevertheless, throughout his career, the sentiments of the\r\nman of action strongly predominated over those of the man of thought. He\r\ntreated all shams with a truly Carlylean hatred and contempt. Moreover,\r\none trait in his character strongly indicates the pride of the masterful\r\nman of action who scorns all adventitious advantages and claims to stand\r\nor fall by his own merits. Napoleon, whilst the members of his family\r\nwere putting forth ignoble claims to noble birth, said that his patent\r\nof nobility dated from the battle of Montenotte. Antigonus, albeit he\r\ncame of a royal stock, laid aside all ancestral claims to the throne of\r\nMacedonia. He aspired to be king because of his kingly qualities. He\r\nwished his people to apply to him the words which Tiberius used of a\r\ndistinguished Roman of humble birth: \"Curtius Rufinus videtur mihi ex se\r\nnatus\" (_Ann._ xi. 21). He succeeded in his attempt. He won the hearts\r\nof his people, and although he failed in his endeavour to govern the\r\nwhole of Greece through the agency of subservient \"tyrants,\" he\r\naccomplished the main object which through good and evil fortune he\r\npursued with dogged tenacity throughout the whole of his chequered\r\ncareer. He lived and died King of Macedonia.\r\n\r\nThe world-politics of this period are almost as confused as the\r\nrelationships which were the outcome of the matrimonial alliances\r\ncontracted by the principal actors on the world's stage. How bewildering\r\nthese alliances were may be judged from what Mr. Tarn says of\r\nStratonice, the daughter of Antiochus I., who married Demetrius, the son\r\nof Antigonus: \"Stratonice was her husband's first cousin and also his\r\naunt, her mother-in-law's half-sister and also her niece, her\r\nfather-in-law's niece, her own mother's granddaughter-in-law, and\r\nperhaps other things which the curious may work out.\" Mr. Tarn has\r\nunravelled the tangled political web with singular lucidity. Here it\r\nmust be sufficient to say that, after the death of Pyrrhus, a conflict\r\nbetween Macedonia and Egypt, which stood at the head of an\r\nanti-Macedonian coalition of which Athens, Epirus, and Sparta were the\r\nprincipal members, became inevitable. The rivalry between the two States\r\nled to the Chremonidean war--so called because in 266 the Athenian\r\nChremonides moved the declaration of war against Antigonus. The result\r\nof the war was that on land Antigonus remained the complete master of\r\nthe situation. With true political instinct, however, he recognised the\r\ntruth of that maxim which history teaches from the days of Aegospotami\r\nto those of Trafalgar, viz. that the execution of an imperial policy is\r\nimpossible without the command of the sea. This command had been secured\r\nby his predecessors, but had fallen to Egypt after the fine fleet\r\ncreated by Demetrius the Besieger had been shattered in 280 by Ptolemy\r\nKeraunos with the help of the navy which had been created by Lysimachus.\r\nAntigonus decided to regain the power which had been lost. His efforts\r\nwere at first frustrated by the wily and wealthy Egyptian monarch, who\r\nknew the power of gold. \"Egypt neither moved a man nor launched a ship,\r\nbut Antigonus found himself brought up short, his friends gone, his\r\nfleet paralysed.\" Then death came unexpectedly to his aid and removed\r\nhis principal enemies. His great opponent, the masterful Arsinoë, who\r\nhad engineered the Chremonidean war, was already dead, and, in Mr.\r\nTarn's words, \"comfortably deified.\" Other important deaths now followed\r\nin rapid succession. Alexander of Corinth, Antiochus, and Ptolemy all\r\npassed away. \"The imposing edifice reared by Ptolemy's diplomacy\r\nsuddenly collapsed like the card-house of a little child.\" Antigonus was\r\nnot the man to neglect the opportunity thus afforded to him. Though now\r\nadvanced in years, he reorganised his navy and made an alliance with\r\nRhodes, with the result that \"the sea power of Egypt went down, never to\r\nrise again.\" Then he triumphantly dedicated his flagship to the Delian\r\nApollo. The possession of Delos had always been one of the main objects\r\nof his ambition. It did more than symbolise the rule of the seas. It\r\ndefinitely brought within the sphere of Macedonian influence one of the\r\ngreatest centres of Greek religious thought.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the story may be read in Mr. Tarn's graphic pages. He\r\nrelates how Antigonus incurred the undying enmity of Aratus of Sicyon,\r\none of those Greek democrats who held \"that the very worst democracy was\r\ninfinitely better than the very best 'tyranny'--a conventional view\r\nwhich neglects the uncomfortable fact that the tyranny of a democracy\r\ncan be the worst in the world.\" He lost Corinth, which he never\r\nendeavoured to regain. His system of governing the Peloponnesus through\r\nthe agency of subservient \"tyrants\" utterly collapsed. \"It is,\" Mr. Tarn\r\nsays, \"a strange case of historical justice. As regards Macedonia,\r\nAntigonus had followed throughout a sound and just idea of government,\r\nand all that he did for Macedonia prospered. But in the Peloponnese,\r\nthough he found himself there from necessity rather than from choice, he\r\nhad employed an unjustifiable system; he lived long enough to see it\r\ncollapse.\"\r\n\r\nThe main interest to the present generation of the career of this\r\nremarkable man consists in the fact that it is illustrative of the\r\nbelief that a man of action can also be a man of letters. As it was in\r\nthe days of the Antigonids, so it is now. Napier says that there is no\r\ninstance on record of a successful general who was not also a well-read\r\nman. General Wolfe, the hero of Quebec, on being asked how he came to\r\nadopt a certain tactical combination which proved eminently successful\r\nat Louisbourg, said, \"I had it from Xenophon.\" Havelock \"loved Homer and\r\ntook pattern by Thucydides,\" and, according to Mr. Forrest, adopted\r\ntactics at the battle of Cawnpore which he had learnt from a close\r\nstudy of \"Old Frederick's\" dispositions at Leuthen. There is no greater\r\ndelusion than to suppose that study weakens the arm of the practical\r\npolitician, administrator, or soldier. On the contrary it fortifies it.\r\nLord Wolseley, himself a very distinguished man of action, speaking to\r\nthe students of the Royal Military Academy of Sir Frederick Maurice, who\r\npossessed an inherited literary talent, said that he was \"a fine example\r\nof the combination of study and practice. He is not only the ablest\r\nstudent of war we have, but is also the bravest man I have ever seen\r\nunder fire\"; and on another occasion he wrote: \"It is often said that\r\ndull soldiers make the best fighters, because they do not think of\r\ndanger. Now, Maurice is one of the very few men I know who, if I told\r\nhim to run his head against a stone wall, would do so without question.\r\nHis is also the quickest and keenest intellect I have met in my\r\nservice.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: _Antigonos Gonatas_.

The conclusions at which she arrives are invariably based\r\non profound study and assiduous research. Her generalisations are always\r\nbold, and at times strikingly original. Moreover, it is impossible for\r\nany lover of the classics, albeit he may move on a somewhat lower plane\r\nof erudition, not to sympathise with the erudite enthusiasm of an author\r\nwho expresses \"great delight\" in discovering that Aristotle traced the\r\norigin of the Greek drama to the Dithyramb--that puzzling and\r\n\"ox-driving\" Dithyramb, of which Müller said that \"it was vain to seek\r\nan etymology,\" but whose meaning has been very lucidly explained by\r\nMiss Harrison herself--and whose \"heart stands still\" in noting that \"by\r\na piece of luck\" Plutarch gives the Dionysiac hymn which the women of\r\nElis addressed to the \"noble Bull.\"\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the first feeling excited in the mind of an ordinary\r\nreader, when he is asked to accept some of the conclusions at which\r\nmodern students of anthropology and comparative religion have arrived,\r\nis one of scepticism. Miss Harrison is evidently alive to the existence\r\nof this feeling, for in dealing with the ritualistic significance of the\r\nPanathenaic frieze she bids her readers not to \"suspect they are being\r\njuggled with,\" or to think that she has any wish to strain an argument\r\nwith a view to \"bolstering up her own art and ritual theory.\" It can,\r\nindeed, be no matter for surprise that such suspicions should be\r\naroused. When, for instance, an educated man hears that the Israelites\r\nworshipped a golden calf, or that the owl and the peacock were\r\nrespectively sacred to Juno and Minerva, he can readily understand what\r\nis meant. But when he is told that an Australian Emu man, strutting\r\nabout in the feathers of that bird, does not think that he is imitating\r\nan Emu, but that in very fact he is an Emu, it must be admitted that his\r\nintellect, or it may be his imagination, is subjected to a somewhat\r\nsevere strain. Similarly, he may at first sight find some difficulty in\r\nbelieving that any strict relationship can be established between the\r\nAnthesteria and Bouphonia of the cultured Athenians and the idolatrous\r\nveneration paid by the hairy and hyperborean Ainos to a sacred bear, who\r\nis at first pampered and then sacrificed, or the ritualistic tug-of-war\r\nperformed by the Esquimaux, in which one side, personifying ducks,\r\nrepresents Summer, whilst the other, personifying ptarmigans, represents\r\nWinter. Although this scepticism is not only very natural, but even\r\ncommendable, it is certain that the science of modern anthropology, in\r\nwhich we may reflect with legitimate pride that England has taken the\r\nlead, rests on very solid foundations. Indeed, its foundations are in\r\nsome respects even better assured than those of some other sciences,\r\nsuch, for instance, as craniology, whose conclusions would appear at\r\nfirst sight to be capable of more precise demonstration, but which, in\r\nspite of this fair appearance, has as yet yielded results which are\r\nsomewhat disappointing. At the birth of every science it is necessary to\r\npostulate something. The postulates that the anthropologist demands\r\nrival in simplicity those formulated by Euclid. He merely asks us to\r\naccept as facts that the main object of every living creature is to go\r\non living, that he cannot attain this object without being supplied\r\nwith food, and that, in the case of man, his supply of food must\r\nnecessarily be obtained from the earth, the forest, the sea, or the\r\nriver. On the basis of these elementary facts, the anthropologist then\r\nasks us to accept the conclusion that the main beliefs and acts of\r\nprimitive man are intimately, and indeed almost solely, connected with\r\nhis food supply; and having first, by a deductive process of reasoning,\r\nestablished a high degree of probability that this conclusion is\r\ncorrect, he proceeds to confirm its accuracy by reasoning inductively\r\nand showing that a similarity, too marked to be the result of mere\r\naccident or coincidence, exists in the practices which primitive man has\r\nadopted, throughout the world, and which can only be explained on the\r\nassumption that by methods, differing indeed in detail but substantially\r\nthe same in principle, endeavours have been, and still are being, made\r\nto secure an identical object, viz. to obtain food and thus to sustain\r\nlife. The various methods adopted both in the past and the present are\r\ninvariably associated in one form or another with the invocation of\r\nmagical influences. The primitive savage, Miss Harrison says, \"is a man\r\nof action.\" He does not pray. He acts. If he wishes for sun or wind or\r\nrain, \"he summons his tribe, and dances a sun dance or a wind dance or a\r\nrain dance.\" If he wants bear's flesh to eat, he does not pray to his\r\ngod for strength to outwit or to master the bear, but he rehearses his\r\nhunt in a bear dance. If he notices that two things occur one after the\r\nother, his untrained intellect at once jumps to the conclusion that one\r\nis the cause and the other the effect. Thus in Australia--a specially\r\nfertile field for anthropological research, which has recently been\r\nexplored with great thoroughness and intelligence by Messrs. Spencer and\r\nGillen--the cry of the plover is frequently heard before rain falls.\r\nTherefore, when the natives wish for rain they sing a rain song in which\r\nthe cry of that bird is faithfully imitated.\r\n\r\nBefore alluding to the special point which Miss Harrison deals with in\r\n_Ancient Art and Ritual_, it will be as well to glance at the views\r\nwhich she sets forth in her previous illuminating treatise entitled\r\n_Themis_. The former is in reality a continuation of the latter work.\r\nThe view heretofore generally entertained as regards the anthropomorphic\r\ngods of Greece has been that the conception of the deity preceded the\r\nadoption of the ritual. Moreover, one school of anthropologists ably\r\nrepresented by Professor Ridgeway, has maintained that the phenomena of\r\nvegetation spirits, totemism, etc., rose from primary elements, notably\r\nfrom the belief in the existence of the soul after the death of the\r\nbody. Miss Harrison and those who agree with her hold that this view\r\ninvolves an anthropological heresy. She deprecates the use of the word\r\n\"anthropomorphic,\" which she describes as clumsy and too narrow. She\r\nprefers the expression ἀνθρωποφυής used by Herodotus (i. 131),\r\nsignifying \"of human growth.\" She points out that the anthropomorphism\r\nof the Greeks was preceded by theriomorphism and phytomorphism, that the\r\nritual was \"prior to the God,\" that so long as man was engaged in a\r\nhand-to-hand struggle for bare existence his sole care was to obtain\r\nfood, and that during this stage of his existence his religious\r\nobservances took almost exclusively the form of magical inducements to\r\nthe earth to renew that fertility which, by the periodicity of the\r\nseasons, was at times temporarily suspended. It was only at a later\r\nperiod, when the struggle for existence had become less arduous, that\r\nthe belief in the efficacy of magical rites decayed, and that in matters\r\nof religion the primitive Greeks \"shifted from a nature-god to a\r\nhuman-nature god.\"\r\n\r\nIn her more recent work Miss Harrison reverts to this theme, and\r\nsubsequently carries us one step further. She maintains that the\r\noriginal conception of the Greek drama was in no way spectacular. The\r\nAthenians went to the theatre as we go to church. They did not attend to\r\nsee players act, but to take part in certain ritualistic things done\r\n(_dromena_). The priests of Dionysos Eleuthereus, of Apollo\r\nDaphnephoros, and of other deities attended in solemn state to assist in\r\nthe performance of the rites. With that keen sense of humour which\r\nenlivens all her pages, and which made her speak in her _Themis_ of the\r\naugust father of gods and men as \"an automatically explosive\r\nthunderstorm,\" Miss Harrison says, \"It is as though at His Majesty's the\r\nfront row of stalls was occupied by the whole bench of bishops, with the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury enthroned in the central stall.\" The actual\r\n_dromenon_ performed was of the same nature as that which in more modern\r\ntimes has induced villagers to make Jacks-in-the-Green and to dance\r\nround maypoles. It was always connected with the recurrence of the\r\nseasons and with the death and resurrection of vegetation. In fact, the\r\nwhole ritual clustered round the idea represented at a later period in\r\nthe well-known and very beautiful lines of Moschus in the _Lament for\r\nBion_, which may be freely translated thus:\r\n\r\n    Ah me! The mallows, anise, and each flower\r\n      That withers at the blast of winter's breath\r\n    Await the vernal, renovating hour\r\n      And joyously awake from feignèd death.\r\n\r\nThe idea which impelled these ancient Greeks to perform ritualistic\r\n_dromena_ on their orchestras, which took the place of what we should\r\ncall the stage, is not yet dead. Miss Harrison quotes from Mr. Lawson's\r\nwork on modern Greek folklore, which is a perfect mine of knowledge on\r\nthe subject of the survival of ancient religious customs in modern\r\nGreece, the story of an old woman in Euboea who was asked on Easter Eve\r\nwhy village society was in a state of gloom and despondency, and who\r\nreplied: \"Of course, I am anxious; for if Christ does not rise\r\nto-morrow, we shall have no corn this year.\"\r\n\r\nIt was during the fifth century that the _dromenon_ and the Dionysiac\r\nDithyramb passed to some extent away and were merged into the drama.\r\n\"Homer came to Athens, and out of Homeric stories playwrights began to\r\nmake their plots.\" The chief agent in effecting this important change\r\nwas the so-called \"tyrant\" Pisistratus, who was probably a free-thinker\r\nand \"cared little for magic and ancestral ghosts,\" but who for political\r\nreasons wished to transport the Dionysia from the country to the town.\r\n\"Now,\" Miss Harrison says, \"to bring Homer to Athens was like opening\r\nthe eyes of the blind.\" Independently of the inevitable growth of\r\nscepticism which was the natural result of increased knowledge and more\r\nacute powers of observation, it is no very hazardous conjecture to\r\nassume that the quick-witted and pleasure-loving Athenians welcomed the\r\nrelief afforded to the dreary monotony of the ancient _dromena_ by the\r\nintroduction of the more lively episodes drawn from the heroic sagas.\r\n\"Without destroying the old, Pisistratus contrived to introduce the new,\r\nto add to the old plot of Summer and Winter the life-stories of heroes,\r\nand thereby arose the drama.\"\r\n\r\nHaving established her case so far, Miss Harrison makes what she herself\r\nterms \"a great leap.\" She passes from the thing _done_, whether\r\n_dromenon_ or drama, to the thing _made_. She holds that as it was the\r\ngod who arose from the rite, similarly it was the ritual connected with\r\nthe worship of the god which gave birth to his representation in\r\nsculpture. Art, she says, is not, as is commonly supposed, the \"handmaid\r\nof religion.\" \"She springs straight out of the rite, and her first\r\noutward leap is the image of the god.\" Miss Harrison gives two examples\r\nto substantiate her contention. In the first place, she states at some\r\nlength arguments of irrefutable validity to show that the Panathenaic\r\nfrieze, which originally surrounded the Parthenon, represents a great\r\nritual procession, and she adds, \"Practically the whole of the reliefs\r\nthat remain to us from the archaic period, and a very large proportion\r\nof those of later date, when they do not represent heroic mythology, are\r\nritual reliefs, 'votive' reliefs, as we call them; that is, prayers or\r\npraises translated into stone.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Harrison's second example is eminently calculated to give a shock\r\nto the conventional ideas generally entertained, for, as she herself\r\nsays, if there is a statue in the world which apparently represents \"art\r\nfor art's sake\" it is that of the Apollo Belvedere. Much discussion has\r\ntaken place as to what Apollo is supposed to be doing in this famous\r\nstatue. \"There is only one answer. We do not know.\" Miss Harrison,\r\nhowever, thinks that as he is poised on tiptoe he may be in the act of\r\ntaking flight from the earth. Eventually, after discussing the matter at\r\nsome little length, she appears to come to the audacious conclusion\r\nwhich, in spite of its hardy irreverence, may very probably be true,\r\nthat as Apollo was, after all, only an early Jack-in-the-Green, he has\r\nbeen artistically represented in marble by some sculptor of genius in\r\nthat capacity.\r\n\r\nFinally, before leaving this very interesting and instructive work, it\r\nmay be noted that Miss Harrison quotes a remarkable passage from\r\nAthenaeus (xiv. 26), which certainly affords strong confirmation of her\r\nview that in the eyes of ancient authors there was an intimate\r\nconnection between art and dancing, and therefore, inasmuch as dancing\r\nwas ritualistic, between art and ritual. \"The statues of the craftsmen\r\nof old times,\" Athenaeus says, \"are the relics of ancient dancing.\"\r\n\r\nIt is greatly to be hoped that Miss Harrison will continue the study of\r\nthis subject, and that she will eventually give to the world the results\r\nof her further inquiries.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: _Ancient Art and Ritual._ By Miss Jane Harrison. London:\r\nWilliams and Norgate. 1s.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\nPORTUGUESE SLAVERY\r\n\r\n_\"The Spectator,\" August 16, 23, 30, 1913_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to read the White Paper recently published on the\r\nsubject of slavery in the West African dominions of Portugal without\r\ncoming to the conclusion that the discussion has been allowed to\r\ndegenerate into a rather unseemly wrangle between the Foreign Office\r\nofficials and the Anti-Slavery Society. There is always a considerable\r\nrisk that this will happen when enthusiasts and officials are brought\r\ninto contact with each other. On the one hand, the enthusiasts in any\r\ngreat cause are rather prone to let their emotions dominate their\r\nreason, to generalise on somewhat imperfect data, and occasionally to\r\nfall unwittingly into making statements of fact which, if not altogether\r\nincorrect, are exaggerated or partial. On the other hand, there is a\r\ndisposition on the part of officials to push to an excess Sir Arthur\r\nHelps's dictum that most of the evils of the world arise from\r\ninaccuracy, and to surround all enthusiasts with one general atmosphere\r\nof profound mistrust. An old official may perhaps be allowed to say,\r\nwithout giving offence, that, quite apart from the nobility and moral\r\nworth of the issue at stake, it is, from the point of view of mere\r\nworldly wisdom, a very great error to adopt this latter attitude. There\r\nare enthusiasts and enthusiasts. It is probably quite useless for an\r\nanti-suffragist or a supporter of vivisection to endeavour to meet\r\nhalf-way a militant suffragist or a whole-hearted anti-vivisectionist.\r\nIn these cases the line of cleavage is too marked to admit of\r\ncompromise, and still less of co-operation. But the case is very\r\ndifferent if the matter under discussion is the suppression of slavery.\r\nHere it may readily be admitted that both the enthusiasts and the\r\nofficials, although they may differ in opinion as to the methods which\r\nshould be adopted, are honestly striving to attain the same objects. The\r\nAnti-Slavery Society, and those who habitually work with them, have\r\nperformed work of which their countrymen are very justly proud. But they\r\nare not infallible. It is quite right that the accuracy of any\r\nstatements which they make should be carefully tested by whatever means\r\nexist for testing them. For instance, when the Society of Friends[105]\r\nsay that they are in possession of \"first-hand information\" to show that\r\n\"atrocities\" are being committed in the Portuguese dominions, the\r\nForeign Office is obviously justified in asking them to state on what\r\nevidence this formidable accusation is founded, and when it appears that\r\nthey cannot produce \"exactly the kind of evidence as to 'atrocities'\r\nwhich would strengthen your (_i.e._ the British Government's) hands in\r\nany protest made by you to the Portuguese Government,\" it is not\r\nunnatural that the officials should be somewhat hardened in their belief\r\nthat humanitarian testimony has to be accepted with caution. It would\r\nobviously be much wiser for the humanitarians to recognise that\r\nincorrect statements, or sweeping generalisations which are incapable of\r\nproof, do their cause more harm than good.\r\n\r\nThe fact that erroneous statements are frequently made in controversial\r\nmatters, and that the data on which generalisations are based are often\r\nimperfect, should not, however, beget the error of attaching undue\r\nimportance to matters of this sort, and thus failing to see the wood by\r\nreason of the trees. What object, for instance, is to be gained by\r\naddressing to the Anti-Slavery Society a remonstrance because they only\r\nquote a portion and not the whole of a conversation between Sir Edward\r\nGrey and the Portuguese Minister (M. de Bocage) when, on reference to\r\nthe account of that conversation, it would appear that the passages\r\nomitted were not very material to the point under discussion? Again,\r\nconsidering that the manner in which the so-called \"contracts\" with\r\nslaves are concluded is notorious, is it not rather begging the question\r\nand falling back on a legal quibble to say that there would \"be no\r\nreason for insisting on the repatriation (of a British subject) if he\r\nwere working under a contract which could not be shown to be illegal\"?\r\nCan it be expected, moreover, that Sir Eyre Crowe's contention that the\r\nslaves \"are now legally free\" should carry much conviction when it is\r\nabundantly clear from the testimony of all independent and also official\r\nwitnesses that this legal freedom does not constitute freedom in the\r\nsense in which we generally employ the term, but that it has, in fact,\r\nup to the present time been little more than an euphemism for slavery?\r\n\r\nEvery allowance should, of course, be made for the embarrassing position\r\nin which the present Government of Portugal, from no fault of its own,\r\nis placed. The fact, however, remains that at this moment the criticisms\r\nof those who are interested in the cause of anti-slavery are not solely\r\ndirected against the Portuguese Government. They also demur to the\r\nattitude taken up by the British Government. It is, indeed, impossible\r\nto read the papers presented to Parliament without feeling that the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury was justified in saying, during a recent debate\r\nin the House of Lords, that the Foreign Office and its subordinates have\r\nshown some excess of zeal in apologising for the Portuguese. After all,\r\nit should not be forgotten that the voice of civilised humanity calls\r\nloudly on the Portuguese Government and nation to purge themselves, and\r\nthat speedily, of a very heinous offence against civilisation, namely,\r\nthat of placing their black fellow-creatures much on the same footing as\r\nthe oxen that plough their fields and the horses which draw their carts,\r\nin order that the white man may acquire wealth. It is only fair to\r\nremember that at no very remote period of their history the Anglo-Saxon\r\nrace were also guilty of this offence; but the facts that one branch of\r\nthat race purged itself of crime by the expenditure of huge sums of\r\nmoney, and that the other branch shed its best blood in order to ensure\r\nthe black man's freedom, give them a moral right, based on very\r\nsubstantial title-deeds, to plead the cause of freedom. Neither should\r\nit be forgotten that, whatever mistakes those interested in the\r\nAnti-Slavery cause may make in dealing with points of detail, they are\r\nright on the chief issue--right, that is to say, not merely in\r\nintention, but also on the main fact, viz. that virtual slavery still\r\nexists in the Portuguese dominions. Any one who has had practical\r\nexperience of dealing with these matters, and can read between the lines\r\nof the official correspondence, cannot fail to see that if the Foreign\r\nOffice authorities, instead of dwelling with somewhat unnecessary\r\ninsistence on controversial points and only half-accepting the realities\r\nof the situation, had candidly admitted the main facts and had confined\r\nthemselves to a discussion of the means available for arriving at the\r\nobject which they, in common with the Anti-Slavery Society, wished to\r\nattain, much useless recrimination might have been avoided and the\r\ninterests of the cause would, to a far greater extent, have been served.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the present article has had a good deal to do with the\r\nAnti-Slavery and other similar societies, such, for instance, as that\r\nwhich, until recently, dealt with the affairs of the Congo. He has not\r\nalways agreed with their proposals, but, being in thorough sympathy with\r\nthe objects which they wished to attain, he was fortunately able to\r\nestablish the mutual confidence which that bond of sympathy connoted. He\r\ncan, moreover, from his own experience, testify to the fact that,\r\nalthough there may occasionally be exceptions, the humanitarians\r\ngenerally, however enthusiastic, are by no means unreasonable. On the\r\ncontrary, if once they are thoroughly convinced that the officials are\r\nhonestly and energetically striving to do their best to remove the\r\nabuses of which they complain, they are quite prepared to make due\r\nallowance for practical difficulties, and to abstain from causing\r\nunnecessary and hurtful embarrassment. They are not open to the\r\nsuspicion which often attaches itself to Parliamentarians who take up\r\nsome special cause, viz. that they may be seeking to acquire personal\r\nnotoriety or to gain some party advantage. The righteousness and\r\ndisinterestedness of their motives cannot be doubted. The question of\r\nthe abolition of slavery in the Soudan presented many and great\r\ndifficulties, which might easily have formed the subject of acrimonious\r\ncorrespondence and of agitation in Parliament and in the press. Any such\r\nagitation would very probably have led to the adoption of measures whose\r\nvalue would have been illusory rather than real, and which might well\r\nhave endangered both public security and the economic welfare of the\r\ncountry. The main reason why no such agitation took place was that a\r\nmutual feeling of confidence was established. Sir Reginald Wingate and\r\nhis very able staff of officials were left to deal with the matter after\r\ntheir own fashion. The result has been that, without the adoption of any\r\nvery sensational measures calculated to attract public attention, it may\r\nbe said, with truth, that for all practical purposes slavery has quietly\r\ndisappeared from the Soudan. But if once this confidence is conspicuous\r\nby its absence, a state of more or less latent warfare between the\r\nhumanitarians and the official world, such as that revealed in the\r\npapers recently laid before Parliament, is almost certain to be created,\r\nwith the results that the public interests suffer, that rather heated\r\narguments and counter-arguments are bandied about in the columns of the\r\nnewspapers, and that the differences of opinion on minor points between\r\nthose who ought to be allies tend to obscure the main issue, and\r\npreclude that co-operation which should be secured, and which in itself\r\nwould be no slight earnest of success.\r\n\r\nStress has been laid on this point because of its practical importance,\r\nand also in the hope that, in connection with this question, it may be\r\nfound possible ere long to establish better relations between the\r\nForeign Office officials and the Anti-Slavery Society than those which\r\napparently exist at present. There ought to be no great difficulty in\r\neffecting an improvement in those relations, for it cannot for one\r\nmoment be doubted that both sides are honestly endeavouring to perform\r\nwhat they consider to be their duty according to their respective\r\nlights.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the consideration of the question on its own merits, it\r\nis obvious that, before discussing any remedies, it is essential to\r\narrive at a correct diagnosis of the disease. Is the trade in slaves\r\nstill carried on, and does slavery still exist in the Portuguese\r\ndominions? The two points deserve separate treatment, for although\r\nslavery is bad, the slave trade is infinitely worse.\r\n\r\nIt is not denied that until very recently the trade in slaves between\r\nthe mainland and the Portuguese islands was carried on upon an extensive\r\nscale. The Anti-Slavery Society state that within the last twenty-five\r\nyears sixty-three thousand slaves, constituting \"a human cargo worth\r\nsomething over £2,500,000,\" have been shipped to the islands. Moreover,\r\nit appears that, as was to be expected, this trade was, and perhaps to a\r\ncertain extent still is, in the hands of individuals who constitute the\r\ndregs of society, and who, it may confidently be assumed, have not\r\nallowed their operations to be hampered by any kind of moral or humane\r\nscruples. Colonel Freire d'Andrade informed Sir Arthur Hardinge that\r\n\"many of the Portuguese slave-traders at Angola had been convicts\r\nsentenced to transportation,\" who had been allowed to settle in the\r\ncolony. \"It was from among these old convicts or ex-convict settlers and\r\ntheir half-caste progeny that the slave-trading element, denounced by\r\nthe Belgian Government, was largely recruited; they at least were its\r\nmost direct agents.\" Since the accession to power of the Republican\r\nGovernment in Portugal the trade in slaves has been absolutely\r\nprohibited. No Government which professes to follow the dictates of\r\ncivilisation, and especially of Liberalism, could indeed tolerate for a\r\nday the continuance of such a practice. The question which remains for\r\nconsideration is whether the efforts of the Portuguese Government, in\r\nthe sincerity of which there can be no doubt, have been successful or\r\nthe reverse. Has the cessation of the traffic been real and complete or,\r\nas the Anti-Slavery Society appear disposed to think, only partial and\r\n\"nominal\"? On this point the evidence is somewhat conflicting. On the\r\none hand, M. Ramaix, writing on behalf of the Belgian Government on May\r\n1, 1912, says, \"It is well known that the slave trade is still carried\r\non to a certain extent in the neighbourhood of the sources of the\r\nZambesi and Kasai, in a region which extends over the frontiers of the\r\nCongo, Angola, and North-Western Rhodesia,\" and on June 8, 1912, Baron\r\nLalaing, the Belgian Minister in London, said, \"At the instigation of\r\nthe traders the population living on the two slopes of the watershed,\r\nfrom Lake Dilolo to the meridian of Kayoyo, are actively engaged in\r\nsmuggling, arms traffic, and slave trade.\" On the other hand, Mr.\r\nWallace, writing from Livingstone, in Northern Rhodesia, on June 25,\r\n1912, says that \"active slave-trading does not now exist along our\r\nborders.\" On December 6 of the same year he confirmed this statement,\r\nbut added, \"occasional cases may occur, for the status of slave exists,\r\nbut they cannot be many.\" Looking to all the circumstances of the\r\ncase--to the great extent and, in some cases, to the remoteness of the\r\nPortuguese dominions, the ruthless character of the slave-traders, the\r\npecuniary inducements which exist for engaging in a very lucrative\r\ntraffic, the helplessness of the slaves themselves, and the fact that\r\ntraffic in slaves is apparently a common inter-tribal practice in\r\nCentral Africa, it would be unreasonable to expect that the Portuguese\r\nGovernment should be able at once to put a complete stop to these\r\ninfamous proceedings. It may well be that, in spite of every effort, the\r\nslave trade may still linger on for a while. All that can be reasonably\r\nexpected is that the Portuguese authorities should do their utmost to\r\nstop it. That they are doing a good deal cannot be doubted, but it is\r\nsomewhat of a shock to read (_Africa_, No. 2 of 1912, p. 59) that Senhor\r\nVasconcellos rather prided himself on the fact that certain \"Europeans\r\nwho were found guilty of acts of slave traffic\" had merely been\r\n\"immediately expelled from the region,\" and were \"not allowed to return\r\nto the colonies.\" Surely, considering the nature of the offence, a\r\npunishment of this sort errs somewhat on the side of leniency. Had these\r\nmen been residing in Egypt or the Soudan they would have been condemned\r\nto penal servitude for a term of years. It is more satisfactory to\r\nlearn, on the authority of Colonel Freire d'Andrade, that the convicts\r\nto whom allusion has already been made are \"no longer permitted to roam\r\nat large about the colony, but are, save a very few who are allowed to\r\nlive outside on giving a security, kept in the forts of Loanda.\"\r\n\r\nFurther, it would appear that until recently the officials who\r\nregistered the \"serviçaes,\" or native contract labourers, had a direct\r\npecuniary interest in the matter, and were \"thus exposed to the\r\ntemptation of not scrutinising too closely the genuineness of the\r\ncontracts themselves, or the extent to which they were understood and\r\naccepted by savage or semi-savage contracting parties.\" In other words,\r\nthe Portuguese officials employed in registration, far from having any\r\ninducements offered to them to protect the labourers, were strongly\r\ntempted to engage in what, brushing aside official euphemism, may with\r\ngreater accuracy be termed the slave trade pure and simple. It seems\r\nthat this practice is now to be altered. The registration fees are no\r\nlonger to go into the pockets of the registering officials, but are to\r\nbe paid into the Provincial Treasury. The change is unquestionably for\r\nthe better. But it is impossible in this connection not to be struck by\r\nthe somewhat curious standard of official discipline and morality which\r\nappears to exist in the Portuguese service. Colonel Freire d'Andrade\r\ntold Sir Arthur Hardinge that \"he knew of one case where £1,000 had been\r\nmade over a single contract for 'serviçaes' in this way by a local\r\nofficial who had winked, in this connection, at some dishonest or, at\r\nleast, highly doubtful transactions, and who had been censured and\r\nobliged to refund the money.\" As in the case of the Europeans found\r\nguilty of engaging in the slave trade, the punishment awarded appears to\r\nbe somewhat disproportionate to the gravity of the offence. One would\r\nhave thought that peculation of this description would have been visited\r\nat least with dismissal, if not with a short sojourn in the Loanda gaol.\r\n\r\nColonel Freire d'Andrade further states that \"the Lisbon Colonial\r\nOffice had sent out very stringent orders to the Governor-General of\r\nAngola to put a stop once and for all to these slavery operations. New\r\nmilitary outposts had now been created near the northern and eastern\r\nfrontiers of the province.\" It is to be hoped that these orders will be\r\nobeyed, and that they will prove effectual to attain the object in view.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, in spite of some features in the case which would appear\r\nto justify friendly criticism, it would seem that the Portuguese\r\nGovernment are really endeavouring to suppress the trade in slaves. All\r\nthat the British Government can do is to afford them whatever assistance\r\nis possible in British territory, and to encourage them in bold and\r\nstrenuous action against the influential opposition whose enmity has\r\nnecessarily been evoked.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the question of whether slavery--as distinct from the\r\nslave trade--still exists in Portuguese West Africa, it is to be\r\nobserved that it is essential to inquire thoroughly into this question\r\nfor the reason already given, viz. that before considering what remedies\r\nshould be applied it is very necessary that the true nature of the evil\r\nshould be recognised. On this point there is a direct conflict of\r\nopinion. The Anti-Slavery Society maintain that the present system of\r\ncontract labourers ('serviçaes') is merely another name for slavery,\r\nand as one proof of the wide discrepancy between theory and practice\r\nthey point to the fact that whereas there can be no manner of doubt that\r\nundisguised slavery existed until only recently, it was nominally\r\nabolished by law so long ago as 1876. On the other hand, to quote the\r\nwords of Mr. Smallbones, the British Consul at Loanda, the Portuguese\r\nGovernment, whose views on this matter appear to have been received with\r\na certain amount of qualified acceptance by the British Foreign Office,\r\n\"consistently deny\" the existence of a state of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe whole controversy really hangs on what is meant by the word\r\n\"slavery.\" In this, as in so many cases, it is easier to say what the\r\nthing is not than to embrace in one short sentence an accurate and\r\nsufficiently wide explanation of what it is. _Definitio est negatio._ De\r\nBrunetière said that, after fifty years of discussion, it was impossible\r\nto define romanticism. Half a century or more ago, a talented German\r\nwriter (Hackländer) wrote a book entitled _European Slave-life_, in\r\nwhich he attempted to show that, without knowing it, we were all slaves\r\none of another, and, in fact, that the artisan working in a cotton\r\nfactory or the sempstress employed in a milliner's shop was as truly in\r\na state of slavery as the negro who at that time was working in the\r\nfields of Georgia or Carolina. In a sense, of course, it may be said\r\nthat every one who works for his living, from a Cabinet Minister to a\r\ncrossing-sweeper, is a slave, for he has to conform to certain rules,\r\nand unless he works he will be deprived of many advantages which he\r\nwishes to acquire, and may even be reduced to a state of starvation. But\r\nspeculations of this sort may be left to the philosopher and the\r\nsociologist. They have little interest for the practical politician. Sir\r\nEdward Grey endeavoured, for the purposes of the subject now under\r\ndiscussion, to define slavery. \"Voluntary engagement,\" he said, \"is not\r\nslavery, but forcible engagement is slavery.\" The definition is correct\r\nas far as it goes, but it is incomplete, for it fails to answer the\r\nquestion on which a great part of this Portuguese controversy hangs,\r\nviz. what do the words \"voluntary\" and \"forcible\" mean? The truth is\r\nthat it is quite unnecessary, in dealing with this subject, to wander\r\noff into a field strewn with dialectical subtleties. It may not be\r\npossible to define slavery with the same mathematical precision which\r\nEuclid gave to his definitions of a straight line or a point, but every\r\nman of ordinary common sense knows the difference between slavery and\r\nfreedom in the usual acceptation of those terms. He knows well enough\r\nthat however much want or the force of circumstances may oblige an\r\nEnglishman, a Frenchman, or a German to accept hard conditions in\r\nfixing the price at which he is prepared to sell his labour or his\r\nservices, none of these individuals is, in reality, a slave; and he has\r\nonly to inquire very cursorily into the subject to satisfy himself that\r\nthe relations between employer and employed in Portuguese West Africa\r\ndiffer widely from those which exist in any European country, and are in\r\nfact far more akin to what, in the general acceptance of the word, is\r\ntermed slavery.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, it may be said that the contention that the present\r\nsystem of contract labour is merely slavery in disguise rests on three\r\npleas, viz. (1) that even if, as was often the case, the contract\r\nlabourers now actually serving were not forcibly recruited, they were\r\nvery frequently wholly unaware of the true nature of the engagements\r\nwhich they had taken, or of the conditions under which they would be\r\ncalled upon to serve; (2) that not only are they unable to terminate\r\ntheir contracts if they find they have been deceived, but that even on\r\nthe termination of those contracts they are not free to leave their\r\nemployers; and (3) that, even when nominal freedom is conceded, they\r\ncannot take advantage of it, for the reason that the employers or their\r\nGovernment have virtually by their own acts created a state of things\r\nwhich only leaves the slaves to choose between the alternative of\r\ncontinuing in a state of servitude or undergoing extreme suffering,\r\nending not improbably in death. It is submitted that, if these three\r\npropositions can be proved, it is mere juggling with words to maintain\r\nthat no state of slavery exists.\r\n\r\nAs regards the first point, it is to be observed that when the superior\r\nintelligence and education of the recruiting agents are contrasted with\r\nthe complete savagery and ignorance of the individuals recruited, there\r\nis obviously a strong presumption that in numberless cases the latter\r\nhave been cozened into making contracts, the nature of which they did\r\nnot in the least understand, and this presumption may almost be said to\r\nharden into certainty when the fact, to which allusion has already been\r\nmade, is remembered, that the Portuguese officials engaged in the\r\nregistration of contract labourers had until very recently a direct\r\npecuniary interest in augmenting the number of labourers. Further, Mr.\r\nSmallbones, writing on September 26, 1912, alludes to a letter signed\r\n\"Carlos de Silva,\" which appeared in a local paper termed the\r\n_Independente_. M. de Silva says that the \"serviçaes\" engaged in Novo\r\nRedondo \"all answered the interpreter's question whether they were\r\nwilling to go to San Thomé with a decided 'No,' which was translated by\r\nthe interpreter as signifying their utmost willingness to be embarked.\"\r\nIf this statement is correct, it is in itself almost sufficient to\r\nsatisfy the most severe condemnation of the whole system heretofore\r\nadopted. It is, indeed, impossible to read the evidence adduced in the\r\nWhite Paper without coming to the conclusion that, whatever may be the\r\ncase at present, the system of recruiting in the past has not differed\r\nmaterially from the slave trade. If this be the case, it is clear that,\r\nin spite of any legal technicalities to the contrary, the great majority\r\nof labourers now serving under contract in the islands should, for all\r\npurposes of repatriation and the acquisition of freedom, be placed on a\r\nprecisely similar footing to those whose contracts have expired. There\r\ncan be no moral justification whatever for taking advantage of the\r\nengagements into which they may have entered to keep them in what is\r\npractically a condition of servitude.\r\n\r\nRecently, certain improvements appeared to have been made in the system\r\nof recruiting. Mr. Smallbones states his \"impression that the present\r\nGovernor-General will do all in his power to put the recruiting of\r\nnative labour on a sound footing.\" Moreover, that some change has taken\r\nplace, and that the labourers are alive to the fact that they have\r\ncertain rights, would appear evident from the fact that Vice-Consul\r\nFussell, writing from Lobito on September 15, 1912, reports that \"the\r\nauthorities appear unable to oblige natives to contract themselves.\" It\r\nis not, however, clear that all the changes are in the right direction.\r\nFormerly, M. Carlos de Silva says, \"There was at least a slight\r\nguarantee that 'serviçaes' were not shipped against their wishes in the\r\nfact that they had to contract in the presence of a curator in this\r\n(_i.e._ the Angola) colony.\" Now this guarantee has been removed. The\r\ncontracts may be made in San Thomé before the local guardian, and Mr.\r\nSmallbones, although he is, without doubt, quite right in thinking that\r\n\"the best guarantee against abuses will lie in the choice of the\r\nrecruiting officials, and the way in which their operations are\r\ncontrolled,\" adds the somewhat ominous remark that the object of the\r\nchange has been to \"override the refusal of a curator in Angola to\r\ncontract certain 'serviçaes' should the Governor-General consider that\r\nrefusal unreasonable or inexpedient.\" Sir Edward Grey very naturally\r\ndrew attention to this point. \"It is obvious,\" he wrote to Sir Arthur\r\nHardinge, \"that a labourer once in San Thomé can be much more easily\r\ncoerced into accepting his lot than if the contract is publicly made in\r\nAngola before he leaves the mainland.\" It cannot be said that the answer\r\nhe received from M. Texeira Gomes was altogether complete or\r\nsatisfactory. All the latter would say was that Colonel Wyllie, who had\r\nlately returned from San Thomé, had never heard of any case of a\r\nlabourer signing a contract after he had arrived in the island.\r\n\r\nAll, therefore, that can at present be said on this branch of the\r\nquestion is that the evils of the recruiting system which has been so\r\nfar adopted are abundantly clear, that the Portuguese Government is\r\nendeavouring to improve that system, but that it would as yet be\r\npremature to pronounce any opinion on the results which are likely to be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nThe next point to be considered is the position of the contract labourer\r\non the expiry of his contract. That position is very strikingly\r\nillustrated by an incident which Mr. Smallbones relates in a despatch\r\ndated September 23, 1912. It appears that towards the end of last August\r\nthe Governor-General visited an important plantation on which seven\r\nhundred labourers are employed. The contracts of these men had expired.\r\nThey asked to be allowed to leave the plantation. They were not\r\npermitted to do so. \"Thirteen soldiers were sent from Loanda to\r\nintimidate them, and they returned to work.\" They were then forced to\r\nrecontract. Mr. Smallbones very rightly pointed out to the\r\nGovernor-General the illegality of this proceeding. \"His Excellency,\"\r\nhe says, \"admitted my contention, but remarked that in the present state\r\nof the labour supply such scrupulous observance of the regulations would\r\nentail the entire stoppage of a large plantation, for which he could not\r\nbe responsible.\" Mr. Smallbones adds the following comment: \"I have\r\nventured to relate this incident, because it shows the difficulties of\r\nthe situation. The plantation on which it occurred is very well managed,\r\nand the labourers are very well treated there. Yet it has failed to make\r\nthe conditions of labour attractive to the natives. And as long as the\r\nGovernment are unable to force a supply of labour according to the\r\nregulations, they will have to tolerate or even practise irregularities\r\nin order to safeguard the property and interests of the employers.\"\r\n\r\nThere need be no hesitation in recognising \"the difficulties of the\r\nsituation.\" They are unquestionably very real. But how does the incident\r\nrelated by Mr. Smallbones bear on the contention of the Portuguese\r\nGovernment that no state of slavery exists? In truth, it shatters to\r\nfragments the whole of their argument. As has been already mentioned,\r\nSir Edward Grey defined \"forcible engagement\" as \"slavery.\" Can it be\r\nfor one moment contended that the engagement of these seven hundred men\r\nwas voluntary and not forcible? Obviously not. Therefore slavery still\r\nexists, or at all events existed so late as August 1912.\r\n\r\nThe third point to be considered is whether the liberated slave is\r\npractically able to take advantage of the freedom which has been\r\nconferred on him. Assuredly, he cannot do so. Consider what the position\r\nof these men is. They, or their parents before them, have in numerous\r\ninstances been forcibly removed from their homes, which often lie at a\r\ngreat distance from the spot where they are liberated. They are\r\napparently asked to contribute out of their wages to a repatriation\r\nfund. Why should they do so? They were, in a great many, probably in a\r\nmajority of cases, expatriated either against their will or without\r\nreally understanding what they were doing. Why should they pay for\r\nrepatriation? The responsibility of the Portuguese does not end when the\r\nmen have been paid their wages and are set free. Neither can it be for\r\none moment admitted that that responsibility is limited, as the\r\nGovernor-General would appear to maintain in a Memorandum communicated\r\nto Mr. Smallbones on October 25, 1912, merely to seeing that repatriated\r\nslaves disembarked on the mainland \"shall be protected against the\r\neffects of the change of climate, and principally against themselves.\"\r\nNo one will expect the Portuguese Government to perform the impossible,\r\nbut it is clear that, unless the institution of slavery itself is\r\nconsidered justifiable, the slaves have a right to be placed by the\r\nPortuguese Government and nation in precisely the same position as they\r\nwould have occupied had they never been led into slavery. Apart from the\r\nimpossibility, it may, on several grounds, be undesirable to seek to\r\nattain this ideal, but that is no reason why the validity of the moral\r\nclaim should not be recognised. In many cases it is abundantly clear\r\nthat to speak of a slave liberated at San Thomé being really a free man\r\nin the sense in which that word is generally understood, is merely an\r\nabuse of terms. The only freedom he possesses is that created for him by\r\nhis employers. It consists of being able to wander aimlessly about the\r\nAfrican mainland at the imminent risk of starvation, or of being robbed\r\nof whatever miserable pittance may have been served out to him. For\r\nthese reasons it is maintained that the starting-point for any further\r\ndiscussion on this question is that the plea that slavery no longer\r\nexists in the West African dominions of Portugal is altogether\r\nuntenable. It still exists, though under another name. There remains the\r\nquestion of how its existence can be terminated.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the present article would be the last to underrate the\r\nenormous practical difficulties to be encountered in dealing\r\neffectively with this question. His own experience in cognate matters\r\nenables him in some degree to recognise the nature of those\r\ndifficulties. When the _corvée_ system was abolished in Egypt, the\r\nquestion which really confronted the Government of that country was how\r\nthe whole of a very backward population, the vast majority of whom had\r\nfor centuries been in reality, though not nominally, slaves, could be\r\nmade to understand that, although they would not be flogged if they did\r\nnot clear out the mud from the canals on which the irrigation of their\r\nfields depended, they would run an imminent risk of starvation unless\r\nthey voluntarily accepted payment for performing that service. The\r\ndifficulties were enhanced owing to the facts that the country was in a\r\nstate of quasi-bankruptcy, and the political situation was in the\r\nhighest degree complicated and bewildering. Nevertheless, after a period\r\nof transition, which, it must be admitted, was somewhat agonising, the\r\nproblem was solved, but it was only thoroughly solved after a struggle\r\nwhich lasted for some years. It is a vivid recollection of the arduous\r\nnature of that struggle that induces the writer of the present article\r\nso far to plead the cause of the Portuguese Government as to urge that,\r\nif once it can be fully established that they are moving steadily but\r\nstrenuously in the right direction, no excessive amount of impatience\r\nshould be shown if the results obtained do not immediately answer all\r\nthe expectations of those who wish to witness the complete abolition of\r\nthe hateful system under which the cultivation of cocoa in the West\r\nAfrican Islands has hitherto been conducted. The financial interests\r\ninvolved are important, and deserve a certain, albeit a limited, amount\r\nof consideration. There need be no hesitation whatever in pressing for\r\nthe adoption of measures which may result in diminishing the profits of\r\nthe cocoa proprietors and possibly increasing the price paid by the\r\nconsumers of cocoa. Indeed, there would be nothing unreasonable in\r\narguing that the output of cocoa, worth £2,000,000 a year, had much\r\nbetter be lost to the world altogether rather than that the life of the\r\npresent vicious system should be prolonged. But even if it were\r\ndesirable--which is probably not the case--it is certainly impossible to\r\ntake all the thirty thousand men now employed in the islands and\r\nsuddenly transport them elsewhere. It would be Utopian to expect that\r\nthe Portuguese Government, in the face of the vehement opposition which\r\nthey would certainly have to encounter, would consent to the adoption of\r\nany such heroic measure. As practical men we must, whilst acknowledging\r\nthe highly regrettable nature of the facts, accept them as they stand.\r\nSlight importance can, indeed, be attached to the argument put forward\r\nby one of the British Consular authorities, that \"the native lives under\r\nfar better conditions in San Thomé than in his own country.\" It is\r\nsomewhat too much akin to the plea advanced by ardent fox-hunters that\r\nthe fox enjoys the sport of being hunted. Neither, although it is\r\nsatisfactory to learn that the slaves are now generally well treated,\r\ndoes this fact in itself constitute any justification for slavery. The\r\nsystem must disappear, and the main question is to devise some other\r\nless objectionable system to take its place.\r\n\r\nThere are two radical solutions of this problem. One is to abandon\r\ncocoa-growing altogether, at all events in the island of Principe, a\r\npart of which is infected with sleeping-sickness, and to start the\r\nindustry afresh elsewhere. The other is to substitute free for slave\r\nlabour in the islands themselves. Both plans are discussed in\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Wyllie's very able report addressed to the Foreign\r\nOffice on December 8, 1912. This report is, indeed, one of the most\r\nvaluable contributions to the literature on this subject which have yet\r\nappeared. Colonel Wyllie has evidently gone thoroughly into the matter,\r\nand, moreover, appears to realise the fact, which all experience\r\nteaches, that slavery is as indefensible from an economic as it is from\r\na moral point of view. Free labour, when it can be obtained, is far\r\nless expensive than slave labour.\r\n\r\nColonel Wyllie suggests that the Principe planters should abandon their\r\npresent plantations and receive \"free grants of land in the fertile and\r\npopulous colony of Portuguese Guinea, the soil of which is reported by\r\nall competent authorities to be better suited to cacao-growing than even\r\nthat of San Thomé itself, and certainly far superior to that of\r\nPrincipe. Guinea has from time to time supplied labour to these islands,\r\nso that the besetting trouble of the latter is nonexistent there.\" He\r\nadds: \"I am decidedly of opinion that some such scheme as this is the\r\nonly cure for the blight that has fallen on the island of Principe.\" It\r\nwould require greater local knowledge than any to which the writer of\r\nthe present article can pretend to discuss the merits of this proposal,\r\nbut at first sight it would certainly appear to deserve full and careful\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nBut as regards San Thomé, which is by far the larger and more important\r\nof the two islands, it would appear that the importation of free labour\r\nis not only the best, but, indeed, the only really possible solution of\r\nthe whole problem. It may be suggested that, without by any means\r\nneglecting other points, such as the repatriation of men now serving,\r\nthe efforts both of the Portuguese Government and of all others\r\ninterested in the question should be mainly centred on this issue.\r\nSomething has been already done in this direction, Mr. Harris, writing\r\nin the _Contemporary Review_ of May 1912, said: \"Mozambique labour was\r\ntried in 1908, and this experiment is proving, for the time, so\r\nsuccessful, that many planters look to the East rather than West Africa\r\nfor their future supply. All available evidence appears to prove that\r\nCabinda, Cape Verde, and Mozambique labour is, so far as contract labour\r\ngoes, fairly recruited and honestly treated as 'free labour.'\" It is an\r\nencouraging sign that a Portuguese Company has been formed whose object\r\nis \"to recruit free, paid labourers, natives of the provinces of Angola,\r\nMozambique, Cape Verde, and Guinea.\" Moreover, the following passage\r\nfrom Colonel Wyllie's report deserves very special attention:\r\n\r\n     \"Several San Thomé planters,\" he says, \"realising the advantage of\r\n     having a more intelligent and industrious labourer than the\r\n     Angolan, have signed contracts with an English Company trading in\r\n     Liberia for the supply of labour from Cape Palmas and its\r\n     hinterland, on terms to which no exception can be taken from any\r\n     point of view. Two, if not by now three, batches of Liberians have\r\n     arrived at San Thomé and have been placed on estates for work. The\r\n     Company has posted an English agent there to act as curador to the\r\n     men, banking their money, arranging their home remittances, and\r\n     mediating in any disputes arising between them and their\r\n     employers. The system works wonderfully well, giving satisfaction\r\n     both to the masters and to the men, the latter being as pleased\r\n     with their treatment as the former are with their physique and\r\n     intelligence. There is every prospect of the arrangement being\r\n     developed to the extent of enabling Angolan labour to be\r\n     permanently dispensed with, and possibly superseding Mozambique\r\n     importations as well.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Wyllie then goes on to say: \"The company and its agents complain\r\nof the many obstacles they have had to overcome in the form of hostility\r\nand intrigue on the part of interested parties. Systematic attempts have\r\nbeen made in Liberia to intimidate the gangs from going to San Thomé by\r\ntales of cruelty practised by the Portuguese in the islands.\" More\r\nespecially it would appear that the \"missionaries\" have been advising\r\nthe Liberians not to accept the offers made to them. It is not\r\naltogether surprising that they should do so, for the Portuguese have\r\nacquired an evil reputation which it will take time to efface. To an\r\noutside observer it would appear that an admirable opportunity is here\r\nafforded for the Portuguese Government and the Anti-Slavery Society, who\r\nare in close relation with many of the missionaries, to co-operate in\r\nthe attainment of a common object. Why should not the Portuguese\r\nauthorities invite some agents of the Anti-Slavery Society to visit the\r\nislands and place before them evidence which will enable them\r\nconscientiously to guarantee proper treatment to the Liberian labourers,\r\nand why, when they are once convinced, should not those agents, far from\r\ndiscouraging, encourage Liberians, and perhaps others, to go to San\r\nThomé? If this miracle could be effected--and with real good-will on\r\nboth sides it ought to be possible to effect it--a very great step in\r\nadvance would have been taken to solve this difficult problem. But in\r\norder to realise such an ideal, mutual confidence would have to be\r\nestablished. When the affairs of the Congo were under discussion the\r\nBelgian air was thick with rumours that British humanitarianism was a\r\nmere cloak to hide the greed of British merchants. Similar ideas are, it\r\nwould appear, now afloat at Lisbon. When men's pockets are touched they\r\nare apt to become extremely suspicious of humanitarian intentions. Mr.\r\nWingfield, writing on August 17, 1912, said that the Portuguese\r\nGovernment was not \"convinced of the disinterestedness of all those who\r\ncriticise them,\" and he intimated that there were schemes on foot on the\r\npart of British subjects to acquire \"roças\" in the islands \"at very low\r\nprices.\" It ought not to be difficult to convince the Portuguese\r\nauthorities that the agents employed by the Anti-Slavery Society are in\r\nno way connected with any such projects. On the other hand, it would be\r\nnecessary that those agents should be very carefully chosen, that\r\nbesides being humanitarians they should have some knowledge of business,\r\nand that they should enter upon their inquiry in a spirit of fairness,\r\nand not with any preconceived intention to push to an extreme any\r\nsuspicions they may entertain of Portuguese acts and intentions. It is\r\nsuggested that the adoption of some such mode of proceeding as is here\r\nindicated is worthy of consideration. The Foreign Office might very\r\nproperly act as an intermediary to bring the two parties together.\r\n\r\nFinally, before leaving this branch of the subject, it is to be observed\r\nthat the difficulty of obtaining free labour has occurred elsewhere than\r\nin the Portuguese possessions. It has generally admitted, at all events,\r\nof a partial solution if the labourers are well treated and adequately\r\npaid. Portuguese experience points to a similar conclusion. Mr.\r\nSmallbones, writing on September 23, 1912, quotes the report of the\r\nmanager of the Lobito railway, in which the latter, after stating that\r\nhe has had no difficulty in obtaining all the labour he has required,\r\nadds, \"I attribute the facility in obtaining so large a supply of\r\nlabour, relatively cheaply, to the good food we supply them with, and\r\nchiefly to the regularity with which payments in cash are effected, and\r\nalso to the justice with which they are treated.\"\r\n\r\nThe question of repatriation remains to be treated. It must, of course,\r\nbe remembered that repatriation is an act of justice to the men already\r\nenslaved, but that, by itself, it does little or nothing towards solving\r\nthe main difficulties of the slavery problem. Mr. Wingfield, writing to\r\nSir Edward Grey on August 24, 1912, relates a conversation he had had\r\nwith Senhor Vasconcellos. \"His Excellency first observed that they were\r\ngenerally subjected to severe criticism in England, and said to be\r\nfostering slavery because they did not at once repatriate all natives\r\nwho had served the term of their original contracts. Now they were\r\nblamed for the misfortunes which resulted from their endeavour to act as\r\nEngland was always suggesting that they should act!\" His Excellency made\r\nwhat Parliamentarians would call a good debating point, but the\r\ncomplaint is obviously more specious than real, for what people in\r\nEngland expect is not merely that the slaves should, if they wish it, be\r\nrepatriated, but that the repatriation should be conducted under\r\nreasonably humane conditions. For the purposes of the present argument\r\nit is needless to inquire whether the ghastly story adopted by the\r\nAnti-Slavery Society on the strength of a statement in a Portuguese\r\nnewspaper, but denied by the Portuguese Government, that the corpses of\r\nfifty repatriated men who had died of starvation were at one time to be\r\nseen lying about in the outskirts of Benguella, be true or false.\r\nIndependently of this incident, all the evidence goes to show that\r\nColonel Wyllie is saying no more than the truth when he writes: \"To\r\nrepatriate, _i.e._ to dump on the African mainland without previous\r\narrangement for his reception, protection, or safe conduct over his\r\nfurther route, an Angolan or hinterland 'serviçal' who has spent years\r\nof his life in San Thomé, is not merely to sentence him to death, but to\r\nexecute that sentence with the shortest possible delay.\" It is against\r\nthis system that those interested in the subject in England protested.\r\nThe Portuguese Government appear now to have recognised the justice of\r\ntheir protests, for they have recently adopted a plan somewhat similar\r\nto that initiated by the late Lord Salisbury for dealing with immigrant\r\ncoolies from India. By an Order in Council dated October 17, 1912, it\r\nhas been provided that repatriated \"serviçaes\" should receive a grant of\r\nland and should be set up, free of charge, with agricultural implements\r\nand seeds. This is certainly a step in the right direction. It is as yet\r\ntoo early to say how far the plan will succeed, but if it is honestly\r\ncarried out it ought to go far towards solving the repatriation\r\nquestion. Mr. Smallbones would appear justified in claiming that it\r\n\"should be given a fair trial before more heroic measures are applied.\"\r\nThe repatriation fund, which appears, to say the least, to have been\r\nvery badly administered, ought, without difficulty, to be able to meet\r\nthe expenses which the adoption of this plan will entail.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: Mr. E.W. Brooks subsequently wrote to _The Spectator_ to\r\nexplain that \"the letter in question was in no sense an official letter\r\nfrom the Society of Friends. It was the product of one small meeting of\r\nthat body, which appears to have been misinformed by one or more of its\r\nmembers, and was in no sense a letter from the Society of Friends,\r\nwhich, on the subject of Portuguese Slavery, is officially represented\r\nby its Anti-Slavery Committee, of which he is himself the Honorary\r\nSecretary.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\nENGLAND AND ISLAM\r\n\r\n_\"The Spectator,\" August 23, 1913_\r\n\r\n\r\nAmidst the many important remarks made by Sir Edward Grey in his recent\r\nParliamentary statement on the affairs of the Balkan Peninsula, none\r\ndeserve greater attention than those which dealt with the duties and\r\nresponsibilities of England towards Mohammedans in general. It was,\r\nindeed, high time that some clear and authoritative declaration of\r\nprinciple on this important subject should be made by a Minister of the\r\nCrown. We are constantly being reminded that King George V. is the\r\ngreatest Mohammedan ruler in the world, that some seventy millions of\r\nhis subjects in India are Moslems, and that the inhabitants of Egypt are\r\nalso, for the most part, followers of the Prophet of Arabia. It is not\r\ninfrequently maintained that it is a duty incumbent on Great Britain to\r\ndefend the interests and to secure the welfare of Moslems all over the\r\nworld because a very large number of their co-religionists are British\r\nsubjects and reside in British territory. It is not at all surprising\r\nthat this claim should be advanced, but it is manifestly one which\r\ncannot be admitted without very great and important qualifications.\r\nMoreover, it is one which, from a European point of view, represents a\r\nsomewhat belated order of ideas. It is true that community of religion\r\nconstitutes the main bond of union between Russia and the population of\r\nthe Balkan Peninsula, but apart from the fact that no such community of\r\nreligious thought exists between Christian England and Moslem or Hindu\r\nIndia, it is to be noted that, generally speaking, the tie of a common\r\ncreed, which played so important a part in European politics and\r\ndiplomacy during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, has now been\r\ngreatly weakened, even if it has not disappeared altogether. It has been\r\nsupplanted almost everywhere by the bond of nationality. No practical\r\npolitician would now argue that, if the Protestants of Holland or Sweden\r\nhad any special causes for complaint, a direct responsibility rested on\r\ntheir co-religionists in Germany or England to see that those grievances\r\nwere redressed. No Roman Catholic nation would now advance a claim to\r\ninterfere in the affairs of Ireland on the ground that the majority of\r\nthe population of that country are Roman Catholics.\r\n\r\nThis transformation of political thought and action has not yet taken\r\nplace in the East. It may be, as some competent observers are disposed\r\nto think, that the principle of nationality is gaining ground in Eastern\r\ncountries, but it has certainly not as yet taken firm root. The bond\r\nwhich holds Moslem societies together is still religious rather than\r\npatriotic. Its binding strength has been greatly enhanced by two\r\ncircumstances. One is that Mecca is to the Moslem far more than\r\nJerusalem is to the Christian or to the Jew. From Delhi to Zanzibar,\r\nfrom Constantinople to Java, every devout Moslem turns when he prays to\r\nwhat Mr. Stanley Lane-Poole aptly calls the \"cradle of his creed.\" The\r\nother circumstance is that, although, as Mr. Hughes has said, \"we have\r\nnot seen a single work of authority, nor met with a single man of\r\nlearning who has ever attempted to prove that the Sultans of Turkey are\r\nrightful Caliphs,\" at the same time the spiritual authority usurped by\r\nSelim I. is generally recognised throughout Islam, with the result not\r\nonly that unity of thought has been engendered amongst Moslems, but also\r\nthat religion has to a great extent been incorporated into politics, and\r\nidentified with the maintenance of a special form of government in a\r\nportion of the Moslem world.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the principle of nationality in those eastern countries\r\nwhich are under western dominion might not inconceivably raise political\r\nissues of considerable magnitude, but in the discussions which have from\r\ntime to time taken place on this subject the inconveniences and even\r\ndanger caused by the universality of a non-national bond based on\r\ncommunity of religion have perhaps been somewhat unduly neglected. These\r\ninconveniences have, however, always existed. That the policy which led\r\nto the Crimean War and generally the prolonged tension which existed\r\nbetween England and Russia were due to the British connection with India\r\nis universally recognised. It would be difficult to differentiate the\r\ncauses of that tension, and to say how far it was, on the one hand, due\r\nto purely strategical considerations, or, on the other hand, to a desire\r\nto meet the wishes and satisfy the aspirations of the many millions of\r\nMoslems who are British subjects. Since, however, the general diplomatic\r\nrelations between England and Russia have, fortunately for both\r\ncountries, been placed on a footing of more assured confidence and\r\nfriendship than any which have existed for a long time past, strategical\r\nconsiderations have greatly diminished in importance. The natural result\r\nhas been that the alternative plea for regarding Near Eastern affairs\r\nfrom the point of view of Indian interests has acquired greater\r\nprominence. Those who have been closely in touch with the affairs of\r\nthe Near East, and have watched the gradual decay of Turkey, have for\r\nsome while past foreseen that the time was inevitably approaching when\r\nBritish statesmen and the British nation would be forced by the\r\nnecessities of the situation to give a definite answer to the question\r\nhow far their diplomatic action in Europe would have to be governed by\r\nthe alleged obligation to conciliate Moslem opinion in India. That\r\nquestion received, to a certain limited extent, a practical answer when\r\nBulgaria declared war on Turkey and when not a voice was raised in this\r\ncountry to urge that the policy which dictated the Crimean War should be\r\nrehabilitated.\r\n\r\nThe answer, however, is not yet complete. England is now apparently\r\nexpected by many Moslems to separate herself from the Concert of Europe,\r\nand not impossibly to imperil the peace of the world, in order that the\r\nTurks should continue in occupation of Adrianople. The secretary of the\r\nPunjab Moslem League has informed us through the medium of the press\r\nthat unless this is done the efforts of the extreme Indian Nationalists\r\nto secure the sympathies of Mohammedans in India \"will meet with growing\r\nsuccess.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in reality to this challenge that Sir Edward Grey replied. His\r\nanswer was decisive, and left no manner of doubt as to the policy which\r\nthe British Government intends to pursue. It will almost certainly meet\r\nwith well-nigh universal approval in this country. After explaining that\r\nthe racial sentiments and religious feelings of Moslem subjects of the\r\nCrown would be respected and have full scope, that British policy would\r\nnever be one of intolerance or wanton and unprovoked aggression against\r\na Mohammedan Power, and that the British Government would never join in\r\nany outrage on Mohammedan feelings and sentiments in any part of the\r\nworld, Sir Edward Grey added, \"We cannot undertake the duty of\r\nprotecting Mohammedan Powers outside the British dominions from the\r\nconsequences of their own action.... To suppose that we can undertake\r\nthe protection of and are bound to regulate our European policy so as to\r\nside with a Mussulman Power when that Mussulman Power rejects the advice\r\ngiven to it, that is not a claim we can admit.\"\r\n\r\nThese are wise words, and it is greatly to be hoped that not only the\r\nMoslems of Turkey, but also those inhabiting other countries, will read,\r\nmark, learn, and inwardly digest them. Notably, the Moslems of India\r\nshould recognise that, with the collapse of Turkish power in Europe, a\r\nnew order of things has arisen, that the change which the attitude of\r\nEngland towards Turkey has undergone is the necessary consequence of\r\nthat collapse, and that it does not in the smallest degree connote\r\nunfriendliness to Islam. In fact, they must now endeavour to separate\r\nIslamism from politics. With the single exception of the occupation of\r\nCyprus, which, as Lord Goschen very truly said at the time, \"prevented\r\nBritish Ambassadors from showing 'clean hands' to the Sultan in proof of\r\nthe unselfishness of British action,\" the policy of England in the Near\r\nEast has been actuated, ever since the close of the Napoleonic wars, by\r\na sincere and wholly disinterested desire to save Turkish statesmen from\r\nthe consequences of their own folly. In this cause no effort has been\r\nspared, even to the shedding of the best blood of England. All has been\r\nin vain. History does not relate a more striking instance of the truth\r\nof the old Latin saying that self-deception is the first step on the\r\nroad to ruin. Advice tendered in the best interests of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire has been persistently rejected. The Turks, who have always been\r\nstrangers in Europe, have shown conspicuous inability to comply with the\r\nelementary requirements of European civilisation, and have at last\r\nfailed to maintain that military efficiency which has, from the days\r\nwhen they crossed the Bosphorus, been the sole mainstay of their power\r\nand position. It is, as Sir Edward Grey pointed out, unreasonable to\r\nexpect that we should now save them from the consequences of their own\r\naction. Whether Moslems all over the world will or should still continue\r\nto regard the Sultan of Turkey as their spiritual head is a matter on\r\nwhich it would be presumptuous for a Christian to offer any opinion, but\r\nhowever this may be, Indian Moslems would do well to recognise the fact\r\nthat circumstances, and not the hostility of Great Britain or of any\r\nother foreign Power, have materially altered the position of the Sultan\r\nin so far as the world of politics and diplomacy is concerned. Whether\r\nthe statesman in whose hands the destinies of Turkey now lie at once\r\nabandon Adrianople, or whether they continue to remain there for a time\r\nwith the certainty that they will be sowing the seeds of further\r\nbloodshed in the near future, one thing is certain. It is that the days\r\nof Turkey as an European Power are numbered. Asia must henceforth be her\r\nsphere of action.\r\n\r\nThat these truths should be unpalatable to Indian Moslems is but\r\nnatural; neither is it possible to withhold some sympathy from them in\r\nthe distress which they must now feel at the partial wreck of the most\r\nimportant Moslem State which the world has yet seen. But facts, however\r\ndistasteful, have to be faced, and it would be truly deplorable if the\r\nnon-recognition of those facts should lead our Moslem fellow-subjects\r\nin India to resent the action of the British Government and to adopt a\r\nline of conduct from which they have nothing to gain and everything to\r\nlose. But whatever that line of conduct may be, the duty of the British\r\nGovernment and nation is clear. Their European policy, whilst allowing\r\nall due weight to Indian interests and sentiment, must in the main be\r\nguided by general considerations based on the necessities of civilised\r\nprogress throughout the world, and on the interests and welfare of the\r\nBritish Empire as a whole. The idea that that policy should be diverted\r\nfrom its course in order to subserve the cause of a single Moslem Power\r\nwhich has rejected British advice is, as Sir Edward Grey very rightly\r\nremarked, wholly inadmissible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\nSOME INDIAN PROBLEMS[106]\r\n\r\n_\"The Spectator,\" August 30, 1913_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of the optimism at times displayed in dealing with Indian\r\naffairs, which may be justified on grounds which are often, to say the\r\nleast, plausible, it is impossible to ignore the fact that the general\r\ncondition of India gives cause for serious reflection, if not for grave\r\nanxiety. We are told on all sides that the East is rapidly awakening\r\nfrom its torpid slumbers--even to the extent of forgetting that\r\ncharacteristically Oriental habit of thought embodied in the Arabic\r\nproverb, \"Slowness is from God, hurry from the Devil.\" If this be so, we\r\nmust expect that, year by year, problems of ever-increasing complexity\r\nwill arise which will tax to the utmost the statesmanship of those\r\nWestern nations who are most brought in contact with Eastern peoples.\r\nIn these circumstances, it is specially desirable that the different\r\npoints of view from which Indian questions may be regarded should be\r\nlaid before the British public by representatives of various schools of\r\nthought. But a short time ago a very able Socialist member of Parliament\r\n(Mr. Ramsay MacDonald) gave to the world the impressions he had derived\r\nwhilst he was \"careering over the plains of Rajputana,\" and paying\r\nhurried visits to other parts of India. His views, although manifestly\r\nin some degree the result of preconceived opinions, and somewhat tainted\r\nwith the dogmatism which is characteristic of the political school of\r\nthought to which he belongs, exhibit at the same time habits of acute\r\nobservation and powers of rapid--sometimes unduly rapid--generalisation.\r\nNeither are they, on the whole, so prejudiced as might have been\r\nexpected from the antecedents and political connections of the author.\r\nMore recently we have had in a work written by Mr. Mallik, which was\r\nlately reviewed in these columns, a striking specimen of one of those\r\npernicious by-products which are the natural and unavoidable outcome of\r\nEastern and Western contact. We have now to deal with a work of a very\r\ndifferent type. Many of the very difficult problems which Mr. Mitra\r\ndiscusses in his interesting series of _Anglo-Indian Studies_ open up a\r\nwide field for differences of opinion, but whatever views may be\r\nentertained about them, all must recognise not only that no kind of\r\nexception can be taken to the general spirit in which Mr. Mitra\r\napproaches Indian subjects, but also that his observations are the\r\nresult of deep reflection, and of an honest endeavour to improve rather\r\nthan exacerbate racial relations. His remarks are, therefore, well\r\nworthy of consideration.\r\n\r\nMr. Mitra shows a perfectly legitimate pride in the past history of his\r\ncountry. He tells us how Hindu international lawyers anticipated Grotius\r\nby some thirty centuries, how the Mahabharata embodies many of the\r\nprinciples adopted by the Hague Conference, how India preceded Europe in\r\nher knowledge of all the arts and sciences, even including that of\r\nmedicine, and how \"Hindu drama was in its heyday before the theatres of\r\nEngland, France, or Spain could be said to exist.\" But Mr. Mitra's\r\nardent patriotism does not blind him to the realities of the present\r\nsituation. A very intelligent Frenchman, M. Paul Boell, who visited\r\nIndia a few years ago, came to the conclusion that the real Indian\r\nquestion was not whether the English were justified in staying in the\r\ncountry, but whether they could find any moral justification for\r\nwithdrawing from it. Mr. Mitra arrives at much the same conclusion as M.\r\nBoell. \"If the English were to withdraw from India to-morrow,\" he says,\r\n\"I fear that, notwithstanding all the peace precepts of our Mahabharata,\r\nand in spite of the stupendous philosophy and so-called fatalism of the\r\nHindus, our Maharajahs would speedily be at each other's throats, as\r\nthey were before the _pax Britannica_ was established there.\" Moreover,\r\nhe asserts a principle of vital importance, which is but too often\r\nignored by his countrymen, and even at times by those who sympathise\r\nwith them in England. \"Education and knowledge,\" he says, \"can be pumped\r\ninto the student, but there is no royal road for instruction in\r\n'capacity of management.' A Clive, with inferior education, may be a\r\nbetter manager of men or of an industrial concern than the most learned\r\nstudent.\" In other words, character rather than intellect is the\r\nfoundation not only of national but also of individual greatness--a\r\nprofound truth which is brought home every day to those who are engaged\r\nin the actual management of public affairs, especially in the East. Mr.\r\nMitra, moreover, makes various praiseworthy efforts to dispel certain\r\nillusions frequently nourished by some of his countrymen, and to\r\ndiminish the width of the religious gulf which separates the rulers from\r\nthe ruled. He quotes with approval Sir Rajendra Mookerjee's complete,\r\nalbeit facile, exposure of the fallacy, dear to the hearts of many\r\nIndian press writers and platform speakers, that Indian interests suffer\r\nby the introduction of British capital into India. \"It is wise,\" Sir\r\nRajendra said, \"to allow British capitalists to interest themselves in\r\nour industries and thus take an active part in their development.\" He\r\nprefers to dwell on the points of similarity which unite rather than on\r\nthe differences which separate Hinduism and Christianity. \"The two\r\nreligions,\" he says, \"have so much in common when one gets down to\r\nessentials that it seems to me this ought to furnish a great bond of\r\nsympathy between the two peoples,\" and he urges that \"every attempt\r\nshould be made to utilise the Hindu University to remove the spirit of\r\nsegregation which unquestionably exists between the Christian Government\r\nin India and its Hindu subjects, and thus pave the way to harmonious\r\nco-operation between the Aryan rulers and the ruled in India.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be as well, however, to turn from these points to what Mr. Mitra\r\nconsiders the shortcomings of the British Government. He is not sparing\r\nin his criticisms. He freely admits that British statesmen have devoted\r\ntheir energies to improving the conditions of the masses, but he adds,\r\nand it must be sorrowfully admitted that he is justified in adding,\r\n\"Material advantages set forth in dry statistics have never made a\r\nnation enthusiastically loyal to the Government.\" He urges that,\r\nespecially in dealing with a population the vast majority of which is\r\nilliterate, \"it is the _human element_ that counts most in Imperialism,\r\nfar more than the dry bones of political economy.\" In an interesting\r\nchapter of his book entitled _British Statesmanship and Indian\r\nPsychology_, he asks the very pertinent question, \"What does loyalty\r\nmean to the Indian, whether Moslem or Hindu?\" The answer which he gives\r\nto this question is that when the idea of loyalty is brought before the\r\nnative of India, \"it comes in most cases with a jerk, and quickly\r\ndisappears.\" The reason for its disappearance is that no bond of\r\nfellowship has been established between the rulers and the ruled, that\r\nthe native of India is not made to feel that \"he has any real part in\r\nEngland's greatness,\" that the influence and high position of the native\r\nPrinces receive inadequate recognition, and that no scope is offered to\r\nthe military ambition of the citizens of the Indian Empire. \"Under the\r\nCrescent, the Hindu has been Commander of a Brigade; under the Union\r\nJack, even after a century, he sees no likelihood of rising as high as a\r\nlittle subaltern.\"\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, nothing very new in all this. It has been pointed\r\nout over and over again by all who have considered Indian or Egyptian\r\nproblems seriously that the creation of some sort of rather spurious\r\npatriotism when all the elements out of which patriotism naturally grows\r\nare wanting, is rather like searching for the philosopher's stone. At\r\nthe same time, when so sympathetic a critic as Mr. Mitra bids us study\r\nthe \"psychological traits\" of Indian character, it is certainly worth\r\nwhile to inquire whether all that is possible has been done in the way\r\nof evoking sentiments of loyalty based on considerations which lie\r\noutside the domain of material advantage. The most imaginative British\r\nstatesman of recent years has been Lord Beaconsfield. Himself a\r\nquasi-Oriental, he grasped the idea that it would be possible to appeal\r\nto the imagination of other Orientals. The laughter which was to some\r\nextent provoked when, at his suggestion, Queen Victoria assumed the\r\ntitle of Empress of India has now died away, and it is generally\r\nrecognised, even by those who are not on other grounds disposed to\r\nindulge in any exaggerated worship of the primrose, that in this respect\r\nLord Beaconsfield performed an act dictated by true statesmanship. He\r\nappealed to those personal and monarchical sentiments which, to a far\r\ngreater extent than democratic ideas, dominate the minds of Easterns.\r\nThe somewhat lavish expenditure incurred in connection with the King's\r\nrecent visit to India may be justified on similar grounds. Following\r\ngenerally the same order of ideas, Mr. Mitra has some further\r\nsuggestions to make. The question of opening some field to the very\r\nnatural aspirations of the martial races and classes of India presents,\r\nindeed, very great practical difficulties which it would be impossible\r\nto discuss adequately on the present occasion. All that can be said is\r\nthat, although the well-intentioned efforts so far made to solve this\r\nthorny problem do not appear to have met with all the success they\r\ndeserve, it is one which should earnestly engage the attention of the\r\nGovernment in the hope that some practical and unobjectionable solution\r\nmay eventually be found. Mr. Mitra, however, draws attention to other\r\ncognate points which would certainly appear to merit attention. \"The\r\nfirst thing,\" he says, \"necessary to rouse Indian sentiment is to give\r\nIndia a flag of her own.\" He points out that Canada, Australia, South\r\nAfrica, and some of the West Indian islands have flags of their own, and\r\nhe asks why, without in any way serving as a symbol of separation, India\r\nshould not be similarly treated? Then, again, he remarks--and it would\r\nbe well if some of our Parliamentarians took careful note of the\r\nobservation--that \"British statesmen, in their zeal for introducing\r\ntheir democratic system of government into India, forget that India is\r\npre-eminently an aristocratic land.\" This appreciation of the Indian\r\nsituation formed the basis of the political system favoured by no less\r\nan authority than Sir Henry Lawrence, and stood in marked contrast to\r\nthat advocated by his no less distinguished brother, Lord Lawrence. Mr.\r\nMitra, therefore, suggests that a certain number of ruling princes or\r\ntheir heirs-apparent should be allowed to sit in a reformed House of\r\nLords. \"Canada,\" Lord Meath said some years ago, \"is already represented\r\nin the House of Lords,\" and he pertinently asked, \"Why should not India\r\nalso have her peers in that assembly?\" The particular proposal made by\r\nMr. Mitra in this connection may possibly be open to some objections,\r\nbut the general principle which he advocates, as also the suggestion\r\nthat a special flag should be devised for India, would certainly appear\r\nto be well worthy of consideration.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to turn to the view entertained by Mr. Mitra on the\r\nrecent transfer of the seat of Government from Calcutta to Delhi. He\r\nmanifestly does not regard that transfer with any degree of favour.\r\nMoreover, he thinks that from the point of view of the stability of\r\nBritish rule, a great mistake has been made. Delhi, he says, has \"for\r\ncenturies symbolised Moslem-Hindu collective sentiment.\" He assumes that\r\nit is the object of British statesmanship to prevent any union between\r\nMoslems and Hindus, and that the recent transfer will go far to cement\r\nthat union. \"In transferring the capital to the old centre of Indian\r\nImperialism, England has, in a flash, aroused memories to a degree that\r\nthousands of demagogues and agitators would not have done in a century.\"\r\nHe holds, therefore, that the action of British statesmen in this\r\nrespect may not improbably \"produce the reverse of the result they\r\nintended.\" The question of whether it was or was not wise to transfer\r\nthe seat of Government to Delhi is one on which differences of opinion\r\nmay well exist, but Mr. Mitra is in error in supposing that either the\r\nBritish nation collectively or British statesmen individually have ever\r\nproceeded so far on the _divide et impera_ principle as to endeavour in\r\ntheir own interests to foster and perpetuate racial and religious\r\nanimosities. On the contrary, although they have accepted as a fact that\r\nthose animosities exist, and although they have at times been obliged to\r\ninterfere with a view to preventing one race or religion infringing the\r\nrights and liberties of others, they have persistently done their best\r\nto allay discord and sectarian strife. In spite of Mr. Mitra's obvious\r\nand honourable attempts to preserve an attitude of judicial\r\nimpartiality, it is conceivable that in this instance he may, as a\r\nHindu, have allowed himself to be unconsciously influenced by fear\r\nthat, in transferring the capital to a Moslem centre, the British\r\nGovernment has, in his own words, \"placed itself more within the sway of\r\nMoslem influence than the authorities would care to admit.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mitra alludes to several important points of detail, such, for\r\ninstance, as the proposal to establish a port at Cochin, which he fears\r\n\"may be allowed to perish in the coils of official routine,\" and the\r\nsuggestion made by Sir Rajendra Mookerjee that by a reduction of railway\r\nfreights from the mines in the Central Provinces to the port the trade\r\nin manganese might be encouraged. It is to be hoped that these and some\r\nother similar points will receive due attention from the Indian\r\nauthorities. Sufficient has been said to justify the opinion that Mr.\r\nMitra's thoughtful work is a valuable contribution to Indian literature,\r\nand will well repay perusal by all who are interested in the solution of\r\nexisting Indian problems.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: _Anglo-Indian Studies_.

Even when\r\nno such incentive has existed, the temptation to adopt a novel view of\r\nsome celebrated man or woman whose character and career have floated\r\ndown the tide of history cast in a conventional mould has occasionally\r\nproved highly attractive from a mere literary point of view. The process\r\nof whitewashing the bad characters of history may almost be said to\r\nhave established itself as a fashion.\r\n\r\nA similar fate has attended the historians who have recorded the deeds\r\nof the world's principal actors. A few cases, of which perhaps Ranke is\r\nthe most conspicuous, may indeed be cited of historical writers whose\r\nreputations are built on foundations so solid and so impervious to\r\nattack as to defy criticism. But it has more usually happened, as in the\r\ncase of Macaulay, that eminent historians have passed through various\r\nphases of repute. The accuracy of their facts, the justice of their\r\nconclusions, their powers of correct generalisation, and the merits or\r\ndemerits of their literary style have all been brought into court, with\r\nthe result that attention has often been to a great extent diverted from\r\nhistory to the personality of the historians, and that the verdict\r\npronounced has varied according to the special qualities the display of\r\nwhich were for the time being uppermost in the public mind.\r\n\r\nNo recent writer of history has experienced these vicissitudes to a\r\ngreater extent than the illustrious author of _Les Origines de la France\r\ncontemporaine_. That Taine should evoke the enthusiasm of any particular\r\nschool of politicians, and still less the partisans of any particular\r\nrégime in France, was from the very outset obviously impossible. When\r\nwe read his account of the _ancien régime_ we think we are listening to\r\nthe voice of a calm but convinced republican or constitutionalist. When\r\nwe note his scathing exposure of the criminal folly and ineptitude of\r\nthe Jacobins we remain momentarily under the impression that we are\r\nbeing guided by a writer imbued with strong conservative or even\r\nmonarchical sympathies. The iconoclast both of the revolutionary and of\r\nthe Napoleonic legends chills alike the heart of the worshippers at\r\neither shrine. A writer who announces in the preface of his work that\r\nthe only conclusion at which he is able to arrive, after a profound\r\nstudy of the most interesting and stormy period of modern history, is\r\nthat the government of human beings is an extremely difficult task, will\r\nlook in vain for sympathy from all who have adopted any special theory\r\nas to the best way in which that task should be accomplished. Yet, in\r\nspite of Taine's political nihilism, it would be a grave error to\r\nsuppose that he has no general principle to enounce, or no plan of\r\ngovernment to propound. Such is far from being the case. Though no\r\npolitician, he was a profoundly analytical psychologist. M. Le Bon, in\r\nhis brilliant treatise on the psychological laws which govern national\r\ndevelopment, says, \"Dans toutes manifestations de la vie d'une nation,\r\nnous retrouvons toujours l'âme immuable de la race tissant son propre\r\ndestin.\" The commonplace method of stating the same proposition is to\r\nsay that every nation gets the government it deserves. This, in fact, is\r\nthe gospel which Taine had to preach. He thought, in Lady\r\nBlennerhassett's words, that it was \"the underlying characteristics of a\r\npeople; and not their franchise, which determines their Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nAfter having enjoyed for long a high reputation amongst non-partisan\r\nstudents of revolutionary history, Taine's claim to rank as an historian\r\nof the first order has of late been vigorously assailed by a school of\r\nwriters, of whom M. Aulard is probably the best known and the most\r\ndistinguished. They impugn his authority, and even go so far as to\r\nmaintain that his historical testimony is of little or no value. How far\r\nis this view justified? The question is one of real interest to the\r\nhistorical student, whatsoever may be his nationality, and it is,\r\nperhaps, for more than one reason, of special interest to Englishmen. In\r\nthe first place, Taine's method of writing history is eminently\r\ncalculated to commend itself to English readers. His mind was eminently\r\nobjective. He avoided those brilliant and often somewhat specious _a\r\npriori_ generalisations in which even the best French authors are at\r\ntimes prone to indulge. His process of reasoning was strictly\r\ninductive. He only drew conclusions when he had laid an elaborate\r\nfoundation of facts on which they could be based. The spirit in which he\r\nwrote was more Teutonic than Latin. Again, in the absence of any really\r\ncomplete English history of the French Revolution--for Carlyle's\r\nrhapsody, in spite of its unquestionable merits, can scarcely be held to\r\nsupply the want--most Englishmen have been accustomed to think that,\r\nwith De Tocqueville and Taine as their guides, they would be able to\r\nsecure an adequate grasp both of the history of the revolutionary period\r\nand of the main political lessons which that history tends to inculcate.\r\n\r\nIn a very interesting essay published in Lady Blennerhassett's recent\r\nwork, entitled _Sidelights_, which has been admirably translated into\r\nEnglish by Mrs. Gülcher, she deals with the subject now under\r\ndiscussion. No one could be more fitted to cope with the task. Lady\r\nBlennerhassett's previous contributions to literature, her encyclopaedic\r\nknowledge of historical facts, and her thorough grasp of the main\r\npolitical, religious, and economic considerations which moved the hearts\r\nand influenced the actions of men during the revolutionary convulsion\r\ngive her a claim, which none will dare to dispute, to speak with\r\nauthority on this subject. Those who have heretofore looked for\r\nguidance to Taine will, therefore, rejoice to note that she is able to\r\nvindicate his reputation as an historian. \"The six volumes of the\r\n_Origines_,\" she says, \"are, like other human works, not free from\r\nerrors and exaggerations, but in all essentials their author has proved\r\nhimself right, and his singular merit remains.\"\r\n\r\nAs the most suitable illustration of Taine's historical methods Lady\r\nBlennerhassett selects his study of Napoleon. That, she thinks, is \"the\r\nseverest test of the author's skill.\" Taine did not, like Fournier and\r\nothers, attempt to write a history of Napoleonic facts. The strategical\r\nand tactical genius which enabled Napoleon to sweep across Europe and to\r\ncrush Austria and Prussia on the fields of Austerlitz and Jena had no\r\nattraction for him. He wrote a history of ideas. True to his own\r\npsychological habit of thought, he endeavoured to \"reconstruct the\r\nfigure of Napoleon on psychological and physiological lines.\" The\r\njustification of this method is to be found in the fact, the truth of\r\nwhich cannot be gainsaid, that a right estimate of the character of\r\nNapoleon affords one of the principal keys to the true comprehension of\r\nEuropean history for a period of some twenty stirring years. History,\r\nLord Acton said, \"is often made by energetic men steadfastly following\r\nideas, mostly wrong, that determine events.\" Napoleon is a case in\r\npoint. \"The man in Napoleon explains his work.\" But what were the ideas\r\nof this remarkable man, and were those ideas \"mostly wrong\"?\r\n\r\nHis main idea was certainly to satisfy his personal ambition. \"Ma\r\nmaîtresse,\" he said, \"c'est le pouvoir,\" and in 1811, when, although he\r\nknew it not, his star was about to wane, he said to the Bavarian General\r\nWrede, \"In three years I shall be master of the universe.\" He was not\r\ndeterred by any love of country, for it should never be forgotten that,\r\nas Lady Blennerhassett says, \"this French Caesar was not a Frenchman.\"\r\nWhatever patriotic feelings moved in his breast were not French but\r\nCorsican. He never even thoroughly mastered the French language, and his\r\nmother spoke not only bad French, but bad Italian. Her natural language,\r\nMasson tells us, was the Corsican _patois_. In order to gratify his\r\nambition, all considerations based on morality were cast to the winds.\r\n\"I am not like any other man,\" he told Madame de Rémusat; \"the laws of\r\nmorality and decorum do not apply to me.\" Acting on this principle he\r\ndid not hesitate to plunge the world into a series of wars. _Saevit toto\r\nMars impius orbe._\r\n\r\nThe other fundamental idea which dominated the whole of Napoleon's\r\nconduct was based on Voltaire's cynical dictum, \"Quand les hommes\r\ns'attroupent, leurs oreilles s'allongent.\" He was a total disbeliever in\r\nthe wisdom or intelligence of corporate bodies. Therefore, as he told\r\nSir Henry Keating at St. Helena, \"It is necessary always to talk of\r\nliberty, equality, justice, and disinterestedness, and never to grant\r\nany liberty whatever.\" Low as was his opinion of human intelligence, his\r\nestimate of human honesty was still lower. Mr. Lecky, speaking of\r\nNapoleon's relations with Madame de Staël, says: \"A perfectly honest man\r\nwas the only kind of man he could never understand. Such a man perplexed\r\nand baffled his calculations, acting on them as the sign of the cross\r\nacts on the machinations of a demon.\" In his callow youth he had\r\ncoquetted with ultra-Liberal ideas. He had even written an essay in\r\nwhich he expressed warm admiration for Algernon Sidney as an \"enemy to\r\nmonarchies, princes, and nobles,\" and added that \"there are few kings\r\nwho have not deserved to be dethroned.\" These ideas soon vanished. He\r\nbecame the incarnation of ruthless but highly intelligent despotism. The\r\nreputation acquired at Marengo gave him the authority which was\r\nnecessary as a preliminary to decisive action, and albeit, if all\r\naccounts are true, he lost his head at the most important crisis of his\r\ncareer and owed success to the firmness of that Sieyès whom he\r\nscornfully called an \"idéologue\" and a \"faiseur de constitutions,\"\r\nnevertheless on the 18th Brumaire he was able to make captive a tired\r\nnation which pined for peace, and little recked that it was handing over\r\nits destinies to the most ardent devotee of the god of war that the\r\nworld has ever known.\r\n\r\nOnce seated firmly in his saddle Napoleon proceeded to centralise the\r\nwhole French administration, and to establish a régime as despotic as\r\nthat of any of the hereditary monarchs who had preceded him. But it was\r\na despotism of a very different type from theirs. Theirs was stupid, and\r\nexcited the jealousy and hatred of almost every class. His was\r\nintelligent and appealed both to the imagination and to the material\r\ninterests of every individual Frenchman. Theirs was based on privilege;\r\nhis on absolute equality. \"About Napoleon's throne,\" Lady Blennerhassett\r\nsays, \"were gathered Girondists and Jacobins, Royalists and\r\nThermidorians, Plebeians and the one-time Knights of the Holy Ghost,\r\nRoman Catholics and Voltaireans. Kitchen lads became marshals; Drouet,\r\nthe postmaster of Varennes, became Under-Secretary of State; Fouché, the\r\ntorturer and wholesale murderer, a duke; the Suabian candidate for the\r\nLutheran Ministry, Reinhard, was appointed an Imperial Ambassador;\r\nMurat, son of an innkeeper, a king.\"\r\n\r\nDeath, it has been truly said, is the real measure of greatness. What\r\nnow remains of the stupendous fabric erected by Napoleon? \"Of the work\r\nof the Conqueror,\" Lady Blennerhassett says, \"not one stone remains upon\r\nanother.\" As regards the internal reconstruction of France, the case is\r\nvery different. All inquirers are agreed that Napoleon's work endures.\r\nTaine said that \"the machinery of the year VIII.\" still remains. Mr.\r\nFisher, in his work on _Napoleonic Statesmanship_, says that Napoleon\r\n\"created a bureaucracy more competent, active, and enlightened than any\r\nwhich Europe had seen.\" Mr. Bodley bears similar testimony. \"The whole\r\ncentralised administration of France, which, in its stability, has\r\nsurvived every political crisis, was the creation of Napoleon and the\r\nkeystone of his fabric.\"\r\n\r\nNapoleon's administrative creations may, indeed, be criticised from many\r\npoints of view. Notably, it may be said that, if he did not initiate, he\r\nstimulated that excessive \"fonctionnarisme\" which is often regarded as\r\nthe main defect of the French system. But his creations were adapted to\r\nthe special character and genius of the nation over which he ruled. His\r\nmain title-deed to enduring fame is that, for good or evil, he\r\nconstructed an edifice which, in its main features, has lasted to this\r\nday, which shows no signs of decay, and which has exercised a\r\npredominant influence on the administration and judicial systems of\r\nneighbouring countries. Neither the system itself nor the history of its\r\ncreation can be thoroughly understood without a correct appreciation of\r\nthe character and political creed of its founder. It is this\r\nconsideration which affords an ample justification of the special method\r\nadopted by Taine in dealing with the history of the Napoleonic period.\r\n\r\nNothing illustrates Napoleon's character more clearly than the numerous\r\n_ana_ which may be culled from the pages of Madame de Rémusat, Masson,\r\nBeugnot, Rœderer, and others. Of these, some are reproduced by Lady\r\nBlennerhassett. The writer of the present article was informed on good\r\nauthority of the following Napoleonic anecdote. It is related that\r\nNapoleon ordered from Bréguet, the famous Paris watchmaker, a watch for\r\nhis brother Joseph, who was at the time King of Spain. The back was of\r\nblue enamel decorated with the letter J in diamonds. In 1813 Napoleon\r\nwas present at a military parade when a messenger arrived bearing a\r\nbrief despatch, in which it was stated that the French army had been\r\ncompletely defeated at Vittoria. It was manifest that Spain was lost.\r\nAlways severely practical, all that Napoleon did, after glancing at the\r\ndespatch, was to turn to his secretary and say, \"Write to Bréguet and\r\ntell him that I shall not want that watch.\" It is believed that the\r\nwatch was eventually bought by the Duke of Wellington.[108]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: _Sidelights_. By Lady Blennerhassett. Translated by Edith\r\nGülcher. London: Constable & Co. 7s. 6d.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: My informant in this matter was the late General Sir\r\nArthur Ellis. Since the above was written, the Duke of Wellington has\r\ninformed me that there is at Apsley House a watch, not made by Bréguet\r\nbut by another Paris watchmaker, on which is inscribed, \"Ordered by\r\nNapoleon for his brother Joseph.\" The cover is ornamented not with a\r\ndiamond J, but with a map of the Peninsula. Inside is the portrait of a\r\nlady. I do not doubt that this is the watch to which Sir Arthur Ellis\r\nalluded.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\nSONGS, PATRIOTIC AND NATIONAL\r\n\r\n_\"The Spectator,\" September 13, 1913_\r\n\r\n\r\nAll historians are agreed that contemporary ballads and broadsheets\r\nconstitute a priceless storehouse from which to draw a picture of the\r\nsociety existing at the period whose history they seek to relate. Some\r\nof those which have survived to become generally known to later ages\r\nshow such poverty of imagination and such total absence of literary\r\nmerit as to evoke the surprise of posterity at the ephemeral success\r\nwhich they unquestionably achieved. An instance in point is the\r\ncelebrated poem \"Lillibullero,\" or, as it is sometimes written, \"Lilli\r\nBurlero.\" Here is the final stanza of the pitiful doggerel with which\r\nWharton boasted that he had \"sung a king out of three kingdoms\":\r\n\r\n    There was an old prophecy found in a bog:\r\n    Ireland shall be ruled by an ass and a dog;\r\n    And now this prophecy is come to pass,\r\n    For Talbot's the dog, and James is the ass.\r\n            Lillibullero, Bullen-a-la.\r\n\r\nDoggerel as this was, it survived the special occasion for which it was\r\nwritten. When Queen Anne's reign was well advanced balladmongers were\r\nsinging:\r\n\r\n    So God bless the Queen and the House of Hanover,\r\n    And never may Pope or Pretender come over.\r\n            Lillibullero, Bullen-a-la.\r\n\r\nIf the song is still remembered by other than historical students, it is\r\nprobably more because Uncle Toby, when he was hard pressed in argument,\r\n\"had accustomed himself, in such attacks, to whistle Lillibullero,\" than\r\nfor any other reason.\r\n\r\nBut whether it be doggerel or dignified verse, popular poetry almost\r\ninvariably possesses one great merit. When we read the outpourings of\r\nthe seventeenth and eighteenth century poets to the innumerable Julias,\r\nSacharissas, and Celias whom they celebrated in verse, we cannot but\r\nfeel that we are often in contact with a display of spurious passion\r\nwhich is the outcome of the head rather than of the heart. Thus Johnson\r\ntells us that Prior's Chloe \"was probably sometimes ideal, but the woman\r\nwith whom he cohabited was a despicable drab of the lowest species.\" The\r\ncase of popular and patriotic poetry is very different. It is wholly\r\ndevoid of affectation. Whatever be its literary merits or demerits, it\r\nalways represents some genuine and usually deep-rooted conviction. It\r\nenables us to gauge the national aspirations of the day, and to\r\nestimate the character of the nation whose yearnings found expression in\r\nsong. The following lines--written by Bishop Still, the reputed author\r\nof \"Gammer Gurton's Needle\"--very faithfully represent the feelings\r\nexcited in England at the time of the Spanish Armada:\r\n\r\n    We will not change our Credo\r\n      For Pope, nor boke, nor bell;\r\n    And yf the Devil come himself\r\n      We'll hounde him back to hell.\r\n\r\nThe fiery Protestant spirit which is breathed forth in these lines found\r\nits counterpart in Germany. Luther, at a somewhat earlier period, wrote:\r\n\r\n    Erhalt uns, Herr, bei deinem Wort,\r\n    Und steur des Papsts und Türken Mord.\r\n\r\nTake again the case of French Revolutionary poetry. The noble, as also\r\nthe ignoble, sides of that vast upheaval were alike represented in the\r\ncurrent popular poetry of the day. Posterity has no difficulty in\r\nunderstanding why the whole French nation was thrilled by Rouget de\r\nLisle's famous song, to whose lofty strains the young conscripts rushed\r\nto the frontier in order to hurl back the invaders of their country. On\r\nthe other hand, the ferocity of the period found expression in such\r\nlines as:\r\n\r\n    Ah! ça ira, ça ira, ça ira!\r\n    Les aristocrates à la lanterne,\r\n\r\nwhich was composed by one Ladré, a street singer, or in the savage\r\n\"Carmagnole,\" a name originally applied to a peasant costume worn in the\r\nPiedmontese town of Carmagnola, and afterwards adopted by the Maenads\r\nand Bacchanals, who sang and danced in frenzied joy over the judicial\r\nmurder of poor \"Monsieur et Madame Véto.\"\r\n\r\nThe light-hearted and characteristically Latin buoyancy of the French\r\nnation, which they have inherited from the days of that fifth-century\r\nGaulish bishop (Salvianus) who said that the Roman world was laughing\r\nwhen it died (\"moritur et ridet\"), and which has stood them in good\r\nstead in many an arduous trial, is also fully represented in their\r\nnational poetry. No other people, after such a crushing defeat as that\r\nincurred at Pavia, would have been convulsed with laughter over the\r\ninnumerable stanzas which have immortalised their slain commander, M. de\r\nla Palisse:\r\n\r\n    Il mourut le vendredi,\r\n      Le dernier jour de son âge;\r\n    S'il fut mort le samedi,\r\n      Il eût vécu davantage.\r\n\r\nThe inchoate national aspirations, as also the grave and resolute\r\npatriotism of the Germans, found interpreters of genius in the persons\r\nof Arndt and Körner, the latter of whom laid down his life for the\r\npeople whom he loved so well. During the Napoleonic period all their\r\ncompositions, many of which will live so long as the German language\r\nlasts, strike the same note--the determination of Germans to be free:\r\n\r\n    Lasst klingen, was nur klingen kann,\r\n      Die Trommeln und die Flöten!\r\n    Wir wollen heute Mann für Mann\r\n      Mit Blut das Eisen röten.\r\n    Mit Henkerblut, Französenblut--\r\n      O süsser Tag der Rache!\r\n    Das klinget allen Deutschen gut,\r\n      Das ist die grosse Sache.\r\n\r\nSome six decades later, when Arndt's famous question \"Was ist das\r\ndeutsche Vaterland?\" was about to receive a practical answer, the German\r\nsoldier marched to the frontier to the inspiriting strains of \"Die Wacht\r\nam Rhein.\"\r\n\r\nNo more characteristic national poetry was ever written than that evoked\r\nby the civil war which raged in America some fifty years ago. Those who,\r\nlike the present writer, were witnesses on the spot of some portion of\r\nthat great struggle, are never likely to forget the different\r\nimpressions left on their minds by the poetry respectively of the North\r\nand of the South. The pathetic song of the Southerners, \"Maryland, my\r\nMaryland,\" which was composed by Mr. T.R. Randall, appeared, even\r\nwhilst the contest was still undecided, to embody the plaintive wail of\r\na doomed cause, and stood in strong contrast to the aggressive and\r\nalmost rollicking vigour of \"John Brown's Body\" and \"The Union for ever,\r\nHurrah, boys, Hurrah!\"\r\n\r\nEven a nation so little distinguished in literature as the Ottoman Turks\r\nis able, under the stress of genuine patriotism, to embody its hopes and\r\naspirations in stirring verse. The following, which was written during\r\nthe last Russo-Turkish war, suffers in translation. Its rhythm and\r\nheroic, albeit savage, vigour may perhaps even be appreciated by those\r\nwho are not familiar with the language in which it is written:\r\n\r\n    Achalum sanjaklari!\r\n    Ghechelim Balkanlari!\r\n    Allah! Allah! deyerek,\r\n    Dushman kanin' ichelim!\r\n      Padishahmiz chok yasha!\r\n      Ghazi Osman chok yasha![109]\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to Italy and Greece, the nations from which modern\r\nEurope inherits most of its ideas, and which have furnished the greater\r\npart of the models in which those ideas are expressed, whether in prose\r\nor in verse.\r\n\r\nAlthough lines from Virgil, who may almost be said to have created Roman\r\nImperialism, have been found scribbled on the walls of Pompeii, it is\r\nprobable that in his day no popular poetry, in the sense in which we\r\nshould understand the word, existed. But there is something extremely\r\npathetic--more especially in the days when the Empire was hastening to\r\nits ruin--in the feeling, little short of adoration, which the Latin\r\npoets showed to the city of Rome, and in the overweening confidence\r\nwhich they evinced in the stability of Roman rule. This feeling runs\r\nthrough the whole of Latin literature from the days of Ovid and Virgil\r\nto the fifth-century Rutilius, who was the last of the classic poets.\r\nVirgil speaks of Rome as \"the mistress of the world\" (maxima rerum\r\nRoma). Claudian deified Rome, \"O numen amicum et legum genetrix,\" and\r\nRutilius wrote:\r\n\r\n    Exaudi, regina tui pulcherrima mundi,\r\n      Inter sidereos Roma recepta polos,\r\n    Exaudi, genetrix hominum, genetrixque deorum,\r\n      Non procul a caelo per tua templa sumus.\r\n\r\nModern Italians have made ample amends for any lack of purely popular\r\npoetry which may have prevailed in the days of their ancestors. It\r\nwould, indeed, have been strange if the enthusiasm for liberty which\r\narose in the ranks of a highly gifted and emotional nation such as the\r\nItalians had not found expression in song. When the proper time came,\r\nGiusti, Carducci, Mameli, Gordigiani, and scores of others voiced the\r\npatriotic sentiments of their countrymen. They all dwelt on the theme\r\nembodied in the stirring Garibaldian hymn:\r\n\r\n    Va fuori d'Italia!\r\n    Va fuori, o stranier!\r\n\r\nIt will suffice to quote, as an example of the rest, one stanza from an\r\n\"Inno di Guerra\" chosen at random from a collection of popular poetry\r\npublished at Turin in 1863:\r\n\r\n    Coraggio ... All' armi, all' armi,\r\n        O fanti e cavalieri,\r\n        Snudiamo ardenti e fieri,\r\n        Snudiam l'invitto acciar!\r\n            Dall' Umbria mesto e oppresso\r\n        Ci chiama il pio fratello,\r\n        Rispondasi all' appello,\r\n        Corriamo a guerreggiar!\r\n\r\nThe cramping isolation of the city-states of ancient Greece arrested the\r\ngrowth of Hellenic nationalism, and therefore precluded the birth of any\r\ngenuinely nationalist poetry. But it only required the occasion to arise\r\nin order to give birth to patriotic song. Such an occasion was furnished\r\nwhen, under the pressing danger of Asiatic invasion, some degree of\r\nHellenic unity and cohesion was temporarily achieved. Then the tuneful\r\nSimonides recorded the raising of an altar to \"Zeus, the free man's god,\r\na fair token of freedom for Hellas.\"\r\n\r\nIn more modern times the long struggle for Greek independence produced a\r\ncrop of poets who, if they could not emulate the dignity and linguistic\r\nelegance of their predecessors, were none the less able to express their\r\nnational aspirations in rugged but withal very tuneful verse which went\r\nstraight to the hearts of their countrymen. The Klephtic ballads played\r\na very important part in rousing the Greek spirit during the\r\nGraeco-Turkish war at the beginning of the last century. The fine ode of\r\nthe Zantiote Solomos has been adopted as the national anthem, whilst the\r\npoetry of another Ionian, Aristotle Valaorites, and of numerous others\r\nglows with genuine and perfervid patriotism. But perhaps the greatest\r\nnationalist poet that modern Greece has produced was Rhigas Pheraios,\r\nwho, as proto-martyr in the Greek cause, was executed by the Turks in\r\n1798, with the prophecy on his dying lips that he had \"sown a rich seed,\r\nand that the hour was coming when his country would reap its glorious\r\nfruits.\" His Greek Marseillaise (Δεύτε παῖδες τῶν Ἑλλήνων) is known to\r\nEnglishmen through Byron's translation, \"Sons of the Greeks, arise,\r\netc.\" But the glorious lilt and swing of his _Polemisterion_, though\r\nprobably familiar to every child in Greece, is less known in this\r\ncountry. The lines,\r\n\r\n    καλλίτερα μιᾶς ὥρας ἐλευθέρη ζωή,\r\n    παρὰ σαράντα χρόνων σκλαβιὰ καὶ φυλακή,\r\n\r\nrecall to the mind Tennyson's\r\n\r\n    Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109:\r\n\r\n    Let us unfurl the standards!\r\n    Let us cross the Balkans!\r\n    Shouting \"Allah!

The author of \"The Lay of Beowulf,\" whoever he\r\nmay have been, rivalled Homer in the awe-stricken epithets he applied to\r\nthe \"immense stream of ocean murmuring with foam\" (_Il._ xviii. 402).\r\n\"Then,\" he wrote, \"most like a bird, the foamy-necked floater went\r\nwind-driven over the sea-wave; ... the sea-timber thundered; the wind\r\nover the billows did not hinder the wave-floater in her course; the\r\nsea-goer put forth; forth over the flood floated she, foamy-necked, over\r\nthe sea-streams, with wreathed prow until they could make out the cliffs\r\nof the Goths.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the claim of Alfred the Great to be the founder of the British\r\nnavy is now generally rejected by historians, it is certain that from\r\nthe very earliest times the need of dominating the sea was present in\r\nthe minds of Englishmen, and that this feeling gained in strength as the\r\ncenturies rolled on and the value of sea-power became more and more\r\napparent. In a poem entitled \"The Libel of English Policy,\" which is\r\nbelieved to have been written about the year 1436, the following lines\r\noccur:\r\n\r\n    Kepe then the see abought in specialle,\r\n    Whiche of England is the rounde walle;\r\n    As thoughe England were lykened to a cité.\r\n    And the walle enviroun were the see.\r\n    Kepe then the see, that is the walle of England,\r\n    And then is England kepte by Goddes sonde.\r\n\r\nA long succession of poets dwelt on the same theme. Waller--presumably\r\nduring a Royalist phase of his chequered career--addressed the King in\r\nlines which forestalled the very modern political idea that a powerful\r\nBritish navy is not only necessary for the security of England, but also\r\naffords a guarantee for the peace of all the world:\r\n\r\n    Where'er thy navy spreads her canvas wings\r\n    Homage to thee, and peace to all, she brings.\r\n\r\nThomson's \"Rule, Britannia,\" was not composed till 1740, but before that\r\ntime the heroism displayed both by the navy collectively and by\r\nindividual sailors was frequently celebrated in popular verse. The death\r\nof Admiral Benbow, who continued to give orders after his leg had been\r\ncarried off by a chain-shot at the battle of Carthagena in 1702, is\r\nrecorded in the lines:\r\n\r\n    While the surgeon dressed his wounds\r\n        Thus he said, thus he said,\r\n    While the surgeon dressed his wounds thus he said:\r\n        \"Let my cradle now in haste\r\n        On the quarter-deck be placed,\r\n        That my enemies I may face\r\n    Till I'm dead, till I'm dead.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was more especially the long struggle with Napoleon that led to\r\nan outburst of naval poetry. It is to the national feelings current\r\nduring this period that we owe such songs as \"The Bay of Biscay, O,\" by\r\nAndrew Cherry; \"Hearts of Oak,\" by David Garrick[110]; \"The Saucy\r\nArethusa,\" by Prince Hoare; \"A Wet Sheet and a Flowing Sea,\" by Allan\r\nCunningham; \"Ye Mariners of England,\" by Thomas Campbell, and a host of\r\nothers. Amongst this nautical choir, Charles Dibdin, who was born in\r\n1745, stands pre-eminent. Sir Cyprian Bridge, in his introduction to Mr.\r\nStone's collection of _Sea Songs_, tells us that it is doubtful whether\r\nDibdin's songs \"were ever very popular on the forecastle.\" The really\r\npopular songs, he thinks, were of a much more simple type, and were\r\ntermed \"Fore-bitters,\" from the fact that the man who sang them took his\r\nplace on the fore-bitts, \"a stout construction of timber near the\r\nforemast, through which many of the principal ropes were led.\" However\r\nthis may be, there cannot be the smallest doubt that Dibdin's songs\r\nexercised a very powerful effect on landsmen, and contributed greatly to\r\nfoster national pride in the navy and popular sympathy with sailors. It\r\nwas presumably a cordial recognition of this fact that led Pitt to grant\r\nhim a pension. It would, indeed, be difficult to conceive poetry more\r\ncalculated to make the chord of national sentiment vibrate responsively\r\nthan \"Tom Bowling\" or that well-known song in which Dibdin depicted at\r\nonce the high sense of duty and the rough, albeit affectionate,\r\nlove-making of \"Poor Jack\":\r\n\r\n    I said to our Poll, for, d'ye see, she would cry,\r\n      When last we made anchor for sea,\r\n    What argufies sniv'ling and piping your eye?\r\n      Why, what a damn'd fool you must be!\r\n          .      .      .      .      .\r\n    As for me in all weathers, all times, tides and ends,\r\n      Nought's a trouble from duty that springs,\r\n    For my heart is my Poll's, and my rhino my friend's,\r\n      And as for my life it's the King's;\r\n    Even when my time comes, ne'er believe me so soft\r\n      As for grief to be taken aback,\r\n    For the same little cherub that sits up aloft\r\n      Will look out a good berth for poor Jack!\r\n\r\nPride in the navy and its commanders is breathed forth in the following\r\neulogy of Admiral Jervis (Lord St. Vincent):\r\n\r\n    You've heard, I s'pose, the people talk\r\n      Of Benbow and Boscawen,\r\n    Of Anson, Pocock, Vernon, Hawke,\r\n      And many more then going;\r\n    All pretty lads, and brave, and rum,\r\n      That seed much noble service;\r\n    But, Lord, their merit's all a hum,\r\n      Compared to Admiral Jervis!\r\n\r\n\"Tom Tough\" is an example of the same spirit:\r\n\r\n    I've sailed with gallant Howe, I've sailed with noble Jervis,\r\n      And in valiant Duncan's fleet I've sung yo, heave ho!\r\n                Yet more ye shall be knowing,\r\n                I was cox'n to Boscawen,\r\n      And even with brave Hawke have I nobly faced the foe.\r\n\r\nPerfervid patriotism and ardent loyalty find expression in the following\r\nswinging lines:\r\n\r\n    Some drank our Queen, and some our land,\r\n      Our glorious land of freedom;\r\n    Some that our tars might never stand\r\n      For heroes brave to lead 'em!\r\n    That beauty in distress might find\r\n      Such friends as ne'er would fail her;\r\n    But the standing toast that pleased the most\r\n      Was--the wind that blows, the ship that goes,\r\n    And the lass that loves the sailor!\r\n\r\nThe whole-hearted Gallophobia which prevailed at the period, but which\r\ndid not preclude generous admiration for a gallant foe, finds, of\r\ncourse, adequate expression in most of the songs of the period. Thus an\r\nunknown author, who, it is believed, lived at the commencement rather\r\nthan at the close of the eighteenth century, wrote:\r\n\r\n    Stick stout to orders, messmates,\r\n      We'll plunder, burn, and sink,\r\n    Then, France, have at your first-rates,\r\n      For Britons never shrink:\r\n    We'll rummage all we fancy,\r\n      We'll bring them in by scores,\r\n    And Moll and Kate and Nancy\r\n      Shall roll in louis-d'ors.\r\n\r\nIt was long before this spirit died out. Twenty-two years after the\r\nbattle of Waterloo, when, on the occasion of the coronation of Queen\r\nVictoria, Marshal Soult visited England and it was suggested that the\r\nDuke of Wellington should propose the health of the French army at a\r\npublic dinner, he replied: \"D---- 'em. I'll have nothing to do with them\r\nbut beat them.\"\r\n\r\nInspiriting songs, such as \"When Johnny comes marching home\" and \"The\r\nBritish Grenadiers,\" which, Mr. Stone informs us, \"cannot be older than\r\n1678, when the Grenadier Company was formed, and not later than 1714,\r\nwhen hand-grenades were discontinued,\" abundantly testify to the fact\r\nthat the British soldier has also not lacked poets to vaunt his prowess.\r\nMany of the military songs have served as a distinct stimulus to\r\nrecruiting, and possibly some of them were written with that express\r\nobject in view. Sir Ian Hamilton, in his preface to Mr. Stone's\r\ncollection of _War Songs_, says, \"The Royal Fusiliers are the heroes of\r\na modern but inspiriting song, 'Fighting with the 7th Royal Fusiliers.'\r\nIt was composed in the early 'nineties, and produced such an\r\noverwhelming rush of recruits that the authorities could easily, had\r\nthey so chosen, have raised several additional battalions.\" The writer\r\nof the present article remembers in his childhood to have learnt the\r\nfollowing lines from his old nurse, who was the widow of a corporal in\r\nthe army employed in the recruiting service:\r\n\r\n    'Twas in the merry month of May,\r\n      When bees from flower to flower do hum,\r\n    And soldiers through the town march gay,\r\n      And villagers flock to the sound of the drum.\r\n    Young Roger swore he'd leave his plough,\r\n      His team and tillage all begun;\r\n    Of country life he'd had enow,\r\n      He'd leave it all and follow the drum.\r\n\r\nThe British military has perhaps been somewhat less happily inspired\r\nthan the naval muse. Nevertheless the army can boast of some good\r\npoetry. \"Why, soldiers, why?\" the authorship of which is sometimes\r\nerroneously attributed to Wolfe, is a fine song, and the following lines\r\nwritten by an unknown author after the crushing blow inflicted on Lord\r\nGalway's force at Almanza, in 1707, display that absence of\r\ndiscouragement after defeat which is perhaps one of the most severe\r\ntests by which the discipline and spirit of an army can be tried:\r\n\r\n    Let no brave soldier be dismayed\r\n      For losing of a battle;\r\n    We have more forces coming on\r\n      Will make Jack Frenchman rattle.\r\n\r\nAbundant evidence might be adduced to show that the British soldier is\r\namenable to poetic influences. Sir Adam Fergusson, writing to Sir Walter\r\nScott on August 31, 1811, said that the canto of the _Lady of the Lake_\r\ndescribing the stag hunt \"was the favourite among the rough sons of the\r\nfighting Third Division,\" and Professor Courthope in his _History of\r\nEnglish Poetry_ quotes the following passage from Lockhart's _Life of\r\nScott_:\r\n\r\n     When the _Lady of the Lake_ first reached Sir Adam Fergusson, he\r\n     was posted with his company on a point of ground exposed to the\r\n     enemy's artillery; somewhere no doubt on the lines of Torres\r\n     Vedras. The men were ordered to lie prostrate on the ground; while\r\n     they kept that attitude, the Captain, kneeling at their head, read\r\n     aloud the description of the battle in Canto VI., and the listening\r\n     soldiers only interrupted him by a joyous huzza whenever the French\r\n     shot struck the bank close above them.\r\n\r\nFinally, before leaving this subject, it may be noted that amidst the\r\nverse, sometimes pathetic and sometimes rollicking, which appealed more\r\nespecially to the naval and military temperament, there occasionally\r\ncropped up a political allusion which is very indicative of the state of\r\npopular feeling at the time the songs were composed. Thus the following,\r\nfrom a song entitled \"A cruising we will go,\" shows the unpopularity of\r\nthe war waged against the United States in 1812:\r\n\r\n    Be Britain to herself but true,\r\n      To France defiance hurled;\r\n    Give peace, America, with you,\r\n      And war with all the world.\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth-century Spaniards embodied a somewhat similar maxim of\r\nState policy as applied to England in the following distich, the\r\nprinciple of which was, however, flagrantly violated by that fervent\r\nCatholic, Philip II.:\r\n\r\n    Con todo el mundo guerra\r\n    Y paz con Inglaterra.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: Since writing the above it has been pointed out to me\r\nthat Garrick's song was composed during the Seven Years' War\r\n(1756-63).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAbu'l'Ala, 65\r\n\r\nActon, Lord, and the Turks, 80, 223, 266\r\n\r\nActon, Lord, on the making of history, 432\r\n\r\nAdrianople, occupation of, 411\r\n\r\nAkbar, Emperor, 40\r\n\r\nAlexandria, society at, 228\r\n\r\nAlfred the Great, 450\r\n\r\nAlgeria, French in, 250-263\r\n\r\nAlison, 216\r\n\r\nAlliteration, 71\r\n\r\nAlmanza, song on defeat at, 456\r\n\r\nAmerica and Free Trade, 134, 138\r\n\r\nAmerica, war with, in 1812, unpopularity of, 457\r\n\r\nAmherst, Lord, occupies Burma, 288\r\n\r\nAnarchy, 20\r\n\r\nAncient Art and Ritual, 361-371\r\n\r\nAndrade, Colonel Freire d', 380, 383, 384\r\n\r\nAnglo-French Agreement of 1904, 162, 167\r\n\r\nAnglo-Saxon individualism, 15\r\n\r\nAnthology, translations from, 72\r\n\r\nAnthropology, bases of, 364\r\n\r\nAntigonus Gonatas, 351\r\n\r\nAnti-Slavery Society, 373\r\n\r\nApollo Belvedere, 370\r\n\r\nAratus of Sicyon, 358\r\n\r\nArmy reform, 107-126\r\n\r\nArndt, national poetry, 443\r\n\r\nArthur, Sir George, 123\r\n\r\nAsoka, 355\r\n\r\nAssouan dam, 296\r\n\r\nAthenaeus, on dancing, 370\r\n\r\nAttwood, Mr. Charles, 196\r\n\r\nAulard, M., on Taine, 430\r\n\r\n_Aurengzebe_, 73\r\n\r\nAustralia, field of anthropology, 365\r\n\r\n\r\nBacchylides, 65\r\n\r\nBacon, 31\r\n\r\nBarère, 299\r\n\r\nBarth, Dr., on Hinduism, 88\r\n\r\nBeaconsfield, Lord, and Egypt, 203\r\n\r\nBeaconsfield, Lord, and Empress of India, 422\r\n\r\nBembo, Cardinal, 56\r\n\r\nBenbow, Admiral, death of, 451\r\n\r\nBeowulf, on the sea, 450\r\n\r\nBerthier, Marshal, 279\r\n\r\nBismarck, Prince, on statesmanship, 251\r\n\r\n_Bleak House_, 119\r\n\r\nBlennerhassett, Lady, 427-438\r\n\r\nBlücher, Marshal, hallucinations of, 285\r\n\r\nBlunt, Mr. Wilfrid, 81\r\n\r\nBodley, Mr., on French administration, 436\r\n\r\nBoell, M.
