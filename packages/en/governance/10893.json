RICHARDSON\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson\r\n\r\nMarch 4, 1801, to March 4, 1809\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson was born at Shadwell, Albemarle County, Va., on April\r\n2 (old style), 1743. He was the oldest son of Peter Jefferson, who died\r\nin 1757. After attending private schools, he entered William and Mary\r\nCollege in 1760. In 1767 began the practice of the law. In 1769 was\r\nchosen to represent his county in the Virginia house of burgesses, a\r\nstation he continued to fill up to the period of the Revolution. He\r\nmarried Mrs. Martha Skelton in 1772, she being a daughter of John\r\nWayles, an eminent lawyer of Virginia. On March 12, 1773, was chosen\r\na member of the first committee of correspondence established by the\r\nColonial legislature. Was elected a delegate to the Continental Congress\r\nin 1775; was placed on the Committee of Five to prepare the Declaration\r\nof Independence, and at the request of that committee he drafted the\r\nDeclaration, which, with slight amendments, was adopted July 4, 1776.\r\nResigned his seat in Congress and occupied one in the Virginia\r\nlegislature in October, 1776. Was elected governor of Virginia by the\r\nlegislature on June 1, 1779, to succeed Patrick Henry. Retired to\r\nprivate life at the end of his term as governor, but was the same year\r\nelected again to the legislature. Was appointed commissioner with others\r\nto negotiate treaties with France in 1776, but declined. In 1782 he was\r\nappointed by Congress minister plenipotentiary to act with others in\r\nEurope in negotiating a treaty of peace with Great Britain. Was again\r\nelected a Delegate to Congress in 1783, and as a member of that body\r\nhe advocated and had adopted the dollar as the unit and the present\r\nsystem of coins and decimals. In May, 1784, was appointed minister\r\nplenipotentiary to Europe to assist John Adams and Benjamin Franklin\r\nin negotiating treaties of commerce. In March, 1785, was appointed by\r\nCongress minister at the French Court to succeed Dr. Franklin, and\r\nremained in France until September, 1789. On his arrival at Norfolk,\r\nNovember 23, 1789, received a letter from Washington offering him the\r\nappointment of Secretary of State in his Cabinet. Accepted and became\r\nthe first Secretary of State under the Constitution. December 31, 1793,\r\nresigned his place in the Cabinet and retired to private life at his\r\nhome. In 1796 was brought forward by his friends as a candidate for\r\nPresident, but Mr. Adams, receiving the highest number of votes, was\r\nelected President, and Jefferson became Vice-President for four years\r\nfrom March 4, 1797. In 1800 was again voted for by his party for\r\nPresident. He and Mr. Burr received an equal number of electoral votes,\r\nand under the Constitution the House of Representatives was called upon\r\nto elect. Mr. Jefferson was chosen on the thirty-sixth ballot. Was\r\nreelected in 1804, and retired finally from public life March 4, 1809.\r\nHe died on the 4th day of July, 1826, and was buried at Monticello, Va.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTIFICATION OF ELECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Pinckney, from the committee instructed on the 18th instant to wait\r\non the President elect to notify him of his election, reported that the\r\ncommittee had, according to order, performed that service, and addressed\r\nthe President elect in the following words, to wit:\r\n\r\nThe committee beg leave to express their wishes for the prosperity of\r\nyour Administration and their sincere desire that it may promote your\r\nown happiness and the welfare of our country.\r\n\r\nTo which the President elect was pleased to make the following reply:\r\n\r\nI receive, gentlemen, with profound thankfulness this testimony of\r\nconfidence from the great representative council of our nation. It fills\r\nup the measure of that grateful satisfaction which had already been\r\nderived from the suffrages of my fellow-citizens themselves, designating\r\nme as one of those to whom they were willing to commit this charge, the\r\nmost important of all others to them. In deciding between the candidates\r\nwhom their equal vote presented to your choice, I am sensible that age\r\nhas been respected rather than more active and useful qualifications.\r\n\r\nI know the difficulties of the station to which I am called, and feel\r\nand acknowledge my incompetence to them. But whatsoever of\r\nunderstanding, whatsoever of diligence, whatsoever of justice or of\r\naffectionate concern for the happiness of man, it has pleased Providence\r\nto place within the compass of my faculties shall be called forth for\r\nthe discharge of the duties confided to me, and for procuring to my\r\nfellow-citizens all the benefits which our Constitution has placed under\r\nthe guardianship of the General Government.\r\n\r\nGuided by the wisdom and patriotism of those to whom it belongs to\r\nexpress the legislative will of the nation, I will give to that will\r\na faithful execution.\r\n\r\nI pray you, gentlemen, to convey to the honorable body from which you\r\nare deputed the homage of my humble acknowledgments and the sentiments\r\nof zeal and fidelity by which I shall endeavor to merit these proofs of\r\nconfidence from the nation and its Representatives; and accept\r\nyourselves my particular thanks for the obliging terms in which you have\r\nbeen pleased to communicate their will.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 20, 1801.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT ELECT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President laid before the Senate a letter from the President elect\r\nof the United States, which was read, as follows:\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 2, 1801_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE OF THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nSIR: I beg leave through you to inform the honorable the Senate of the\r\nUnited States that I propose to take the oath which the Constitution\r\nprescribes to the President of the United States before he enters on the\r\nexecution of his office on Wednesday, the 4th instant, at 12 o'clock, in\r\nthe Senate Chamber.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n(The same letter was sent to the House of Representatives.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT WASHINGTON, D.C.\r\n\r\n_Friends and Fellow-Citizens_.\r\n\r\nCalled upon to undertake the duties of the first executive office of our\r\ncountry, I avail myself of the presence of that portion of my\r\nfellow-citizens which is here assembled to express my grateful thanks\r\nfor the favor with which they have been pleased to look toward me, to\r\ndeclare a sincere consciousness that the task is above my talents, and\r\nthat I approach it with those anxious and awful presentiments which the\r\ngreatness of the charge and the weakness of my powers so justly inspire.\r\nA rising nation, spread over a wide and fruitful land, traversing all\r\nthe seas with the rich productions of their industry, engaged in\r\ncommerce with nations who feel power and forget right, advancing rapidly\r\nto destinies beyond the reach of mortal eye--when I contemplate these\r\ntranscendent objects, and see the honor, the happiness, and the hopes of\r\nthis beloved country committed to the issue and the auspices of this\r\nday, I shrink from the contemplation, and humble myself before the\r\nmagnitude of the undertaking. Utterly, indeed, should I despair did not\r\nthe presence of many whom I here see remind me that in the other high\r\nauthorities provided by our Constitution I shall find resources of\r\nwisdom, of virtue, and of zeal on which to rely under all difficulties.\r\nTo you, then, gentlemen, who are charged with the sovereign functions of\r\nlegislation, and to those associated with you, I look with encouragement\r\nfor that guidance and support which may enable us to steer with safety\r\nthe vessel in which we are all embarked amidst the conflicting elements\r\nof a troubled world.\r\n\r\nDuring the contest of opinion through which we have passed the animation\r\nof discussions and of exertions has sometimes worn an aspect which might\r\nimpose on strangers unused to think freely and to speak and to write\r\nwhat they think; but this being now decided by the voice of the nation,\r\nannounced according to the rules of the Constitution, all will, of\r\ncourse, arrange themselves under the will of the law, and unite in\r\ncommon efforts for the common good. All, too, will bear in mind this\r\nsacred principle, that though the will of the majority is in all cases\r\nto prevail, that will to be rightful must be reasonable; that the\r\nminority possess their equal rights, which equal law must protect, and\r\nto violate would be oppression. Let us, then, fellow-citizens, unite\r\nwith one heart and one mind. Let us restore to social intercourse that\r\nharmony and affection without which liberty and even life itself are but\r\ndreary things. And let us reflect that, having banished from our land\r\nthat religious intolerance under which mankind so long bled and\r\nsuffered, we have yet gained little if we countenance a political\r\nintolerance as despotic, as wicked, and capable of as bitter and bloody\r\npersecutions. During the throes and convulsions of the ancient world,\r\nduring the agonizing spasms of infuriated man, seeking through blood and\r\nslaughter his long-lost liberty, it was not wonderful that the agitation\r\nof the billows should reach even this distant and peaceful shore; that\r\nthis should be more felt and feared by some and less by others, and\r\nshould divide opinions as to measures of safety. But every difference of\r\nopinion is not a difference of principle. We have called by different\r\nnames brethren of the same principle. We are all Republicans, we are all\r\nFederalists. If there be any among us who would wish to dissolve this\r\nUnion or to change its republican form, let them stand undisturbed as\r\nmonuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated\r\nwhere reason is left free to combat it. I know, indeed, that some honest\r\nmen fear that a republican government can not be strong, that this\r\nGovernment is not strong enough; but would the honest patriot, in the\r\nfull tide of successful experiment, abandon a government which has so\r\nfar kept us free and firm on the theoretic and visionary fear that this\r\nGovernment, the world's best hope, may by possibility want energy to\r\npreserve itself? I trust not. I believe this, on the contrary, the\r\nstrongest Government on earth. I believe it the only one where every\r\nman, at the call of the law, would fly to the standard of the law, and\r\nwould meet invasions of the public order as his own personal concern.\r\nSometimes it is said that man can not be trusted with the government of\r\nhimself. Can he, then, be trusted with the government of others? Or have\r\nwe found angels in the forms of kings to govern him? Let history answer\r\nthis question.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, with courage and confidence pursue our own Federal and\r\nRepublican principles, our attachment to union and representative\r\ngovernment. Kindly separated by nature and a wide ocean from the\r\nexterminating havoc of one quarter of the globe; too high-minded to\r\nendure the degradations of the others; possessing a chosen country, with\r\nroom enough for our descendants to the thousandth and thousandth\r\ngeneration; entertaining a due sense of our equal right to the use of\r\nour own faculties, to the acquisitions of our own industry, to honor and\r\nconfidence from our fellow-citizens, resulting not from birth, but from\r\nour actions and their sense of them; enlightened by a benign religion,\r\nprofessed, indeed, and practiced in various forms, yet all of them\r\ninculcating honesty, truth, temperance, gratitude, and the love of man;\r\nacknowledging and adoring an overruling Providence, which by all its\r\ndispensations proves that it delights in the happiness of man here and\r\nhis greater happiness hereafter--with all these blessings, what more is\r\nnecessary to make us a happy and a prosperous people? Still one thing\r\nmore, fellow-citizens--a wise and frugal Government, which shall\r\nrestrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free\r\nto regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall\r\nnot take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the\r\nsum of good government, and this is necessary to close the circle of our\r\nfelicities.\r\n\r\nAbout to enter, fellow-citizens, on the exercise of duties which\r\ncomprehend everything dear and valuable to you, it is proper you should\r\nunderstand what I deem the essential principles of our Government, and\r\nconsequently those which ought to shape its Administration. I will\r\ncompress them within the narrowest compass they will bear, stating the\r\ngeneral principle, but not all its limitations. Equal and exact justice\r\nto all men, of whatever state or persuasion, religious or political;\r\npeace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations, entangling\r\nalliances with none; the support of the State governments in all their\r\nrights, as the most competent administrations for our domestic concerns\r\nand the surest bulwarks against antirepublican tendencies; the\r\npreservation of the General Government in its whole constitutional\r\nvigor, as the sheet anchor of our peace at home and safety abroad; a\r\njealous care of the right of election by the people--a mild and safe\r\ncorrective of abuses which are lopped by the sword of revolution where\r\npeaceable remedies are unprovided; absolute acquiescence in the\r\ndecisions of the majority, the vital principle of republics, from which\r\nis no appeal but to force, the vital principle and immediate parent of\r\ndespotism; a well-disciplined militia, our best reliance in peace and\r\nfor the first moments of war, till regulars may relieve them; the\r\nsupremacy of the civil over the military authority; economy in the\r\npublic expense, that labor may be lightly burthened; the honest payment\r\nof our debts and sacred preservation of the public faith; encouragement\r\nof agriculture, and of commerce as its handmaid; the diffusion of\r\ninformation and arraignment of all abuses at the bar of the public\r\nreason; freedom of religion; freedom of the press, and freedom of person\r\nunder the protection of the habeas corpus, and trial by juries\r\nimpartially selected. These principles form the bright constellation\r\nwhich has gone before us and guided our steps through an age of\r\nrevolution and reformation. The wisdom of our sages and blood of our\r\nheroes have been devoted to their attainment. They should be the creed\r\nof our political faith, the text of civic instruction, the touchstone by\r\nwhich to try the services of those we trust; and should we wander from\r\nthem in moments of error or of alarm, let us hasten to retrace our steps\r\nand to regain the road which alone leads to peace, liberty, and safety.\r\n\r\nI repair, then, fellow-citizens, to the post you have assigned me. With\r\nexperience enough in subordinate offices to have seen the difficulties\r\nof this the greatest of all, I have learnt to expect that it will rarely\r\nfall to the lot of imperfect man to retire from this station with the\r\nreputation and the favor which bring him into it. Without pretensions to\r\nthat high confidence you reposed in our first and greatest revolutionary\r\ncharacter, whose preeminent services had entitled him to the first place\r\nin his country's love and destined for him the fairest page in the\r\nvolume of faithful history, I ask so much confidence only as may give\r\nfirmness and effect to the legal administration of your affairs. I shall\r\noften go wrong through defect of judgment. When right, I shall often be\r\nthought wrong by those whose positions will not command a view of the\r\nwhole ground. I ask your indulgence for my own errors, which will never\r\nbe intentional, and your support against the errors of others, who may\r\ncondemn what they would not if seen in all its parts. The approbation\r\nimplied by your suffrage is a great consolation to me for the past, and\r\nmy future solicitude will be to retain the good opinion of those who\r\nhave bestowed it in advance, to conciliate that of others by doing them\r\nall the good in my power, and to be instrumental to the happiness and\r\nfreedom of all.\r\n\r\nRelying, then, on the patronage of your good will, I advance with\r\nobedience to the work, ready to retire from it whenever you become\r\nsensible how much better choice it is in your power to make. And may\r\nthat Infinite Power which rules the destinies of the universe lead our\r\ncouncils to what is best, and give them a favorable issue for your peace\r\nand prosperity.\r\n\r\nMARCH 4, 1801.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From the National Intelligencer, March 13, 1801.]\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nWhereas by the first article of the terms and conditions declared by the\r\nPresident of the United States on the iyth day of October, 1791, for\r\nregulating the materials and manner of buildings and improvements on the\r\nlots in the city of Washington, it is provided \"that the outer and party\r\nwalls of all houses in the said city shall be built of brick or stone;\"\r\nand by the third article of the same terms and conditions it is declared\r\n\"that the wall of no house shall be higher than 40 feet to the roof in\r\nany part of the city, nor shall any be lower than 35 feet in any of the\r\navenues;\" and\r\n\r\nWhereas the above-recited articles were found to impede the settlement\r\nin the city of mechanics and others whose circumstances did not admit of\r\nerecting houses authorized by the said regulations, for which cause the\r\nPresident of the United States, by a writing under his hand, bearing\r\ndate the 25th day of June, 1796, suspended the operation of the said\r\narticles until the first Monday of December, 1800, and the beneficial\r\neffects arising from such suspension having been experienced, it is\r\ndeemed proper to revive the same:\r\n\r\nWherefore I, Thomas Jefferson, President of the United States, do\r\ndeclare that the operation of the first and third articles above recited\r\nshall be, and the same is hereby, suspended until the ist day of\r\nJanuary, 1802, and that all the houses which shall be erected in the\r\nsaid city of Washington previous to the said 1st day of January, 1802,\r\nconformable in other respects to the regulations aforesaid, shall be\r\nconsidered as lawfully erected, except that no wooden house shall be\r\nerected within 24 feet of any brick or stone house.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand this 11th day of March, 1801.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn communicating his first message to Congress, President Jefferson\r\naddressed the following letter to the presiding officer of each branch\r\nof the National Legislature:\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 8, 1801.\r\n\r\nThe Honorable the PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nSIR: The circumstances under which we find ourselves at this place\r\nrendering inconvenient the mode heretofore practiced of making by\r\npersonal address the first communications between the legislative and\r\nexecutive branches, I have adopted that by message, as used on all\r\nsubsequent occasions through the session. In doing this I have had\r\nprincipal regard to the convenience of the Legislature, to the economy\r\nof their time, to their relief from the embarrassment of immediate\r\nanswers on subjects not yet fully before them, and to the benefits\r\nthence resulting to the public affairs. Trusting that a procedure\r\nfounded in these motives will meet their approbation, I beg leave\r\nthrough you, sir, to communicate the inclosed message, with the\r\ndocuments accompanying it, to the honorable the Senate, and pray you\r\nto accept for yourself and them the homage of my high respect and\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 8, 1801.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIt is a circumstance of sincere gratification to me that on meeting the\r\ngreat council of our nation I am able to announce to them on grounds of\r\nreasonable certainty that the wars and troubles which have for so many\r\nyears afflicted our sister nations have at length come to an end, and\r\nthat the communications of peace and commerce are once more opening\r\namong them. Whilst we devoutly return thanks to the beneficent Being who\r\nhas been pleased to breathe into them the spirit of conciliation and\r\nforgiveness, we are bound with peculiar gratitude to be thankful to Him\r\nthat our own peace has been preserved through so perilous a season, and\r\nourselves permitted quietly to cultivate the earth and to practice and\r\nimprove those arts which tend to increase our comforts. The assurances,\r\nindeed, of friendly disposition received from all the powers with whom\r\nwe have principal relations had inspired a confidence that our peace\r\nwith them would not have been disturbed. But a cessation of\r\nirregularities which had affected the commerce of neutral nations and of\r\nthe irritations and injuries produced by them can not but add to this\r\nconfidence, and strengthens at the same time the hope that wrongs\r\ncommitted on unoffending friends under a pressure of circumstances will\r\nnow be reviewed with candor, and will be considered as founding just\r\nclaims of retribution for the past and new assurance for the future.\r\n\r\nAmong our Indian neighbors also a spirit of peace and friendship\r\ngenerally prevails, and I am happy to inform yon that the continued\r\nefforts to introduce among them the implements and the practice of\r\nhusbandry and of the household arts have not been without success; that\r\nthey are becoming more and more sensible of the superiority of this\r\ndependence for clothing and subsistence over the precarious resources of\r\nhunting and fishing, and already we are able to announce that instead of\r\nthat constant diminution of their numbers produced by their wars and\r\ntheir wants, some of them begin to experience an increase of population.\r\n\r\nTo this state of general peace with which we have been blessed, one only\r\nexception exists. Tripoli, the least considerable of the Barbary States,\r\nhad come forward with demands unfounded either in right or in compact,\r\nand had permitted itself to denounce war on our failure to comply before\r\na given day. The style of the demand admitted but one answer. I sent a\r\nsmall squadron of frigates into the Mediterranean, with assurances to\r\nthat power of our sincere desire to remain in peace, but with orders to\r\nprotect our commerce against the threatened attack. The measure was\r\nseasonable and salutary. The Bey had already declared war. His cruisers\r\nwere out. Two had arrived at Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nOur commerce in the Mediterranean was blockaded and that of the Atlantic\r\nin peril. The arrival of our squadron dispelled the danger. One of the\r\nTripolitan cruisers having fallen in with and engaged the small schooner\r\n_Enterprise_, commanded by Lieutenant Sterret, which had gone as a\r\ntender to our larger vessels, was captured, after a heavy slaughter of\r\nher men, without the loss of a single one on our part. The bravery\r\nexhibited by our citizens on that element will, I trust, be a testimony\r\nto the world that it is not the want of that virtue which makes us seek\r\ntheir peace, but a conscientious desire to direct the energies of our\r\nnation to the multiplication of the human race, and not to its\r\ndestruction. Unauthorized by the Constitution, without the sanction of\r\nCongress, to go beyond the line of defense, the vessel, being disabled\r\nfrom committing further hostilities, was liberated with its crew. The\r\nLegislature will doubtless consider whether, by authorizing measures of\r\noffense also, they will place our force on an equal footing with that of\r\nits adversaries. I communicate all material information on this subject,\r\nthat in the exercise of this important function confided by the\r\nConstitution to the Legislature exclusively their judgment may form\r\nitself on a knowledge and consideration of every circumstance of weight.\r\n\r\nI wish I could say that our situation with all the other Barbary States\r\nwas entirely satisfactory. Discovering that some delays had taken place\r\nin the performance of certain articles stipulated by us, I thought it my\r\nduty, by immediate measures for fulfilling them, to vindicate to\r\nourselves the right of considering the effect of departure from\r\nstipulation on their side. From the papers which will be laid before you\r\nyou will be enabled to judge whether our treaties are regarded by them\r\nas fixing at all the measure of their demands or as guarding from the\r\nexercise of force our vessels within their power, and to consider how\r\nfar it will be safe and expedient to leave our affairs with them in\r\ntheir present posture.\r\n\r\nI lay before you the result of the census lately taken of our\r\ninhabitants, to a conformity with which we are now to reduce the ensuing\r\nratio of representation and taxation. You will perceive that the\r\nincrease of numbers during the last ten years, proceeding in geometrical\r\nratio, promises a duplication in little more than twenty-two years. We\r\ncontemplate this rapid growth and the prospect it holds up to us, not\r\nwith a view to the injuries it may enable us to do others in some future\r\nday, but to the settlement of the extensive country still remaining\r\nvacant within our limits to the multiplication of men susceptible of\r\nhappiness, educated in the love of order, habituated to self-government,\r\nand valuing its blessings above all price.\r\n\r\nOther circumstances, combined with the increase of numbers, have\r\nproduced an augmentation of revenue arising from consumption in a ratio\r\nfar beyond that of population alone; and though the changes in foreign\r\nrelations now taking place so desirably for the whole world may for a\r\nseason affect this branch of revenue, yet weighing all probabilities of\r\nexpense as well as of income, there is reasonable ground of confidence\r\nthat we may now safely dispense with all the internal taxes,\r\ncomprehending excise, stamps, auctions, licenses, carriages, and refined\r\nsugars, to which the postage on newspapers may be added to facilitate\r\nthe progress of information, and that the remaining sources of revenue\r\nwill be sufficient to provide for the support of Government, to pay the\r\ninterest of the public debts, and to discharge the principals within\r\nshorter periods than the laws or the general expectation had\r\ncontemplated. War, indeed, and untoward events may change this prospect\r\nof things and call for expenses which the imposts could not meet; but\r\nsound principles will not justify our taxing the industry of our\r\nfellow-citizens to accumulate treasure for wars to happen we know not\r\nwhen, and which might not, perhaps, happen but from the temptations\r\noffered by that treasure.\r\n\r\nThese views, however, of reducing our burthens are formed on the\r\nexpectation that a sensible and at the same time a salutary reduction\r\nmay take place in our habitual expenditures. For this purpose those of\r\nthe civil Government, the Army, and Navy will need revisal.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that this Government is charged with the external, and\r\nmutual relations only of these States; that the States themselves have\r\nprincipal care of our persons, our property, and our reputation,\r\nconstituting the great field of human concerns, we may well doubt\r\nwhether our organization is not too complicated, too expensive; whether\r\noffices and officers have not been multiplied unnecessarily and\r\nsometimes injuriously to the service they were meant to promote. I will\r\ncause to be laid before you an essay toward a statement of those who,\r\nunder public employment of various kinds, draw money from the Treasury\r\nor from our citizens. Time has not permitted a perfect enumeration, the\r\nramifications of office being too multiplied and remote to be completely\r\ntraced in a first trial. Among those who are dependent on Executive\r\ndiscretion I have begun the reduction of what was deemed unnecessary.\r\nThe expenses of diplomatic agency have been considerably diminished. The\r\ninspectors of internal revenue who were found to obstruct the\r\naccountability of the institution have been discontinued. Several\r\nagencies created by Executive authority, on salaries fixed by that also,\r\nhave been suppressed, and should suggest the expediency of regulating\r\nthat power by law, so as to subject its exercises to legislative\r\ninspection and sanction. Other reformations of the same kind will be\r\npursued with that caution which is requisite in removing useless things,\r\nnot to injure what is retained. But the great mass of public offices is\r\nestablished by law, and therefore by law alone can be abolished. Should\r\nthe Legislature think it expedient to pass this roll in review and try\r\nall its parts by the test of public utility, they may be assured of\r\nevery aid and light which Executive information can yield. Considering\r\nthe general tendency to multiply offices and dependencies and to\r\nincrease expense to the ultimate term of burthen which the citizen can\r\nbear, it behooves us to avail ourselves of every occasion which presents\r\nitself for taking off the surcharge, that it never may be seen here that\r\nafter leaving to labor the smallest portion of its earnings on which it\r\ncan subsist, Government shall itself consume the whole residue of what\r\nit was instituted to guard.\r\n\r\nIn our care, too, of the public contributions intrusted to our direction\r\nit would be prudent to multiply barriers against their dissipation by\r\nappropriating specific sums to every specific purpose susceptible of\r\ndefinition; by disallowing all applications of money varying from the\r\nappropriation in object or transcending it in amount; by reducing the\r\nundefined field of contingencies and thereby circumscribing\r\ndiscretionary powers over money, and by bringing back to a single\r\ndepartment all accountabilities for money, where the examinations may be\r\nprompt, efficacious, and uniform.\r\n\r\nAn account of the receipts and expenditures of the last year, as\r\nprepared by the Secretary of the Treasury, will, as usual, be laid\r\nbefore you. The success which has attended the late sales of the public\r\nlands shews that with attention they may be made an important source of\r\nreceipt. Among the payments those made in discharge of the principal and\r\ninterest of the national debt will shew that the public faith has been\r\nexactly maintained. To these will be added an estimate of appropriations\r\nnecessary for the ensuing year. This last will, of course, be affected\r\nby such modifications of the system of expense as you shall think proper\r\nto adopt.\r\n\r\nA statement has been formed by the Secretary of War, on mature\r\nconsideration, of all the posts and stations where garrisons will be\r\nexpedient and of the number of men requisite for each garrison. The\r\nwhole amount is considerably short of the present military\r\nestablishment. For the surplus no particular use can be pointed out. For\r\ndefense against invasion their number is as nothing, nor is it conceived\r\nneedful or safe that a standing army should be kept up in time of peace\r\nfor that purpose. Uncertain as we must ever be of the particular point\r\nin our circumference where an enemy may choose to invade us, the only\r\nforce which can be ready at every point and competent to oppose them is\r\nthe body of neighboring citizens as formed into a militia. On these,\r\ncollected from the parts most convenient in numbers proportioned to the\r\ninvading force, it is best to rely not only to meet the first attack,\r\nbut if it threatens to be permanent to maintain the defense until\r\nregulars may be engaged to relieve them. These considerations render it\r\nimportant that we should at every session continue to amend the defects\r\nwhich from time to time shew themselves in the laws for regulating the\r\nmilitia until they are sufficiently perfect. Nor should we now or at any\r\ntime separate until we can say we have done everything for the militia\r\nwhich we could do were an enemy at our door.\r\n\r\nThe provision of military stores on hand will be laid before you, that\r\nyou may judge of the additions still requisite.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the extent to which our naval preparations should be\r\ncarried some difference of opinion may be expected to appear, but just\r\nattention to the circumstances of every part of the Union will doubtless\r\nreconcile all. A small force will probably continue to be wanted for\r\nactual service in the Mediterranean. Whatever annual sum beyond that you\r\nmay think proper to appropriate to naval preparations would perhaps be\r\nbetter employed in providing those articles which may be kept without\r\nwaste or consumption, and be in readiness when any exigence calls them\r\ninto use. Progress has been made, as will appear by papers now\r\ncommunicated, in providing materials for 74-gun ships as directed by\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nHow far the authority given by the Legislature for procuring and\r\nestablishing sites for naval purposes has been perfectly understood and\r\npursued in the execution admits of some doubt. A statement of the\r\nexpenses already incurred on that subject is now laid before you. I have\r\nin certain cases suspended or slackened these expenditures, that the\r\nLegislature might determine whether so many yards are necessary as have\r\nbeen contemplated. The works at this place are among those permitted to\r\ngo on, and five of the seven frigates directed to be laid up have been\r\nbrought and laid up here, where, besides the safety of their position,\r\nthey are under the eye of the Executive Administration, as well as of\r\nits agents, and where yourselves also will be guided by your own view in\r\nthe legislative provisions respecting them which may from time to time\r\nbe necessary. They are preserved in such condition, as well the vessels\r\nas whatever belongs to them, as to be at all times ready for sea on a\r\nshort warning. Two others are yet to be laid up so soon as they shall\r\nhave received the repairs requisite to put them also into sound\r\ncondition. As a superintending officer will be necessary at each yard,\r\nhis duties and emoluments, hitherto fixed by the Executive, will be a\r\nmore proper subject for legislation. A communication will also be made\r\nof our progress in the execution of the law respecting the vessels\r\ndirected to be sold.\r\n\r\nThe fortifications of our harbors, more or less advanced, present\r\nconsiderations of great difficulty. While some of them are on a scale\r\nsufficiently proportioned to the advantages of their position, to the\r\nefficacy of their protection, and the importance of the points within\r\nit, others are so extensive, will cost so much in their first erection,\r\nso much in their maintenance, and require such a force to garrison them\r\nas to make it questionable what is best now to be done. A statement of\r\nthose commenced or projected, of the expenses already incurred, and\r\nestimates of their future cost, as far as can be foreseen, shall be laid\r\nbefore you, that you may be enabled to judge whether any alteration is\r\nnecessary in the laws respecting this subject.\r\n\r\nAgriculture, manufactures, commerce, and navigation, the four pillars of\r\nour prosperity, are then most thriving when left most free to individual\r\nenterprise. Protection from casual embarrassments, however, may\r\nsometimes be seasonably interposed. If in the course of your\r\nobservations or inquiries they should appear to need any aid within the\r\nlimits of our constitutional powers, your sense of their importance is a\r\nsufficient assurance they will occupy your attention. We can not,\r\nindeed, but all feel an anxious solicitude for the difficulties under\r\nwhich our carrying trade will soon be placed. How far it can be\r\nrelieved, otherwise than by time, is a subject of important\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe judiciary system of the United States, and especially that portion\r\nof it recently erected, will of course present itself to the\r\ncontemplation of Congress, and, that they may be able to judge of the\r\nproportion which the institution bears to the business it has to\r\nperform, I have caused to be procured from the several States and now\r\nlay before Congress an exact statement of all the causes decided since\r\nthe first establishment of the courts, and of those which were depending\r\nwhen additional courts and judges were brought in to their aid.\r\n\r\nAnd while on the judiciary organization it will be worthy your\r\nconsideration whether the protection of the inestimable institution of\r\njuries has been extended to all the cases involving the security of our\r\npersons and property. Their impartial selection also being essential to\r\ntheir value, we ought further to consider whether that is sufficiently\r\nsecured in those States where they are named by a marshal depending on\r\nExecutive will or designated by the court or by officers dependent on\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI can not omit recommending a revisal of the laws on the subject of\r\nnaturalization. Considering the ordinary chances of human life, a denial\r\nof citizenship under a residence of fourteen years is a denial to a\r\ngreat proportion of those who ask it, and controls a policy pursued from\r\ntheir first settlement by many of these States, and still believed of\r\nconsequence to their prosperity; and shall we refuse to the unhappy\r\nfugitives from distress that hospitality which the savages of the\r\nwilderness extended to our fathers arriving in this land? Shall\r\noppressed humanity find no asylum on this globe? The Constitution indeed\r\nhas wisely provided that for admission to certain offices of important\r\ntrust a residence shall be required sufficient to develop character and\r\ndesign. But might not the general character and capabilities of a\r\ncitizen be safely communicated to everyone manifesting a bona fide\r\npurpose of embarking his life and fortunes permanently with us, with\r\nrestrictions, perhaps, to guard against the fraudulent usurpation of our\r\nflag, an abuse which brings so much embarrassment and loss on the\r\ngenuine citizen and so much danger to the nation of being involved in\r\nwar that no endeavor should be spared to detect and suppress it?\r\n\r\nThese, fellow-citizens, are the matters respecting the state of the\r\nnation which I have thought of importance to be submitted to your\r\nconsideration at this time. Some others of less moment or not yet ready\r\nfor communication will be the subject of separate messages. I am happy\r\nin this opportunity of committing the arduous affairs of our Government\r\nto the collected wisdom of the Union. Nothing shall be wanting on my\r\npart to inform as far as in my power the legislative judgment, nor to\r\ncarry that judgment into faithful execution. The prudence and temperance\r\nof your discussions will promote within your own walls that conciliation\r\nwhich so much befriends rational conclusion, and by its example will\r\nencourage among our constituents that progress of opinion which is\r\ntending to unite them in object and in will. That all should be\r\nsatisfied with any one order of things is not to be expected; but I\r\nindulge the pleasing persuasion that the great body of our citizens will\r\ncordially concur in honest and disinterested efforts which have for\r\ntheir object to preserve the General and State Governments in their\r\nconstitutional form and equilibrium; to maintain peace abroad, and order\r\nand obedience to the laws at home; to establish principles and practices\r\nof administration favorable to the security of liberty and property, and\r\nto reduce expenses to what is necessary for the useful purposes of\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 11, 1801.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nEarly in the last month I received the ratification by the First Consul\r\nof France of the convention between the United States and that nation.\r\nHis ratification not being pure and simple in the ordinary form, I have\r\nthought it my duty, in order to avoid all misconception, to ask a second\r\nadvice and consent of the Senate before I give it the last sanction by\r\nproclaiming it to be a law of the land.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 22, 1801.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nThe States of Georgia and Tennessee being peculiarly interested in our\r\ncarrying into execution the two acts passed by Congress on the 19th of\r\nFebruary, 1799 (chapter 115), and 13th May, 1800 (chapter 62),\r\ncommissioners were appointed early in summer and other measures taken\r\nfor the purpose. The objects of these laws requiring meetings with the\r\nCherokees, Chickasaws, Choctaws, and Creeks, the inclosed instructions\r\nwere prepared for the proceedings with the three first nations. Our\r\napplications to the Cherokees failed altogether. Those to the Chickasaws\r\nproduced the treaty now laid before you for your advice and consent,\r\nwhereby we obtained permission to open a road of communication with the\r\nMississippi Territory. The commissioners are probably at this time in\r\nconference with the Choctaws. Further information having been wanting\r\nwhen these instructions were, formed to enable us to prepare those\r\nrespecting the Creeks, the commissioners were directed to proceed with\r\nthe others. We have now reason to believe the conferences with the\r\nCreeks can not take place till the spring.\r\n\r\nThe journals and letters of the commissioners relating to the subject of\r\nthe treaty now inclosed accompany it.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 22, 1801.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI now inclose sundry documents supplementary to those communicated to\r\nyou with my message at the commencement of the session. Two others of\r\nconsiderable importance--the one relating to our transactions with the\r\nBarbary Powers, the other presenting a view of the offices of the\r\nGovernment--shall be communicated as soon as they can be completed.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 23, 1801.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAnother return of the census of the State of Maryland is just received\r\nfrom the marshal of that State, which he desires may be substituted as\r\nmore correct than the one first returned by him and communicated by me\r\nto Congress. This new return, with his letter, is now laid before you.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 11, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_.\r\n\r\nI now communicate to you a memorial of the commissioners of the city of\r\nWashington, together with a letter of later date, which, with their\r\nmemorial of January 28, 1801, will possess the Legislature fully of the\r\nstate of the public interests and of those of the city of Washington\r\nconfided to them. The moneys now due, and soon to become due, to the\r\nState of Maryland on the loan guaranteed by the United States call for\r\nan early attention. The lots in the city which are chargeable with the\r\npayment of these moneys are deemed not only equal to the indemnification\r\nof the public, but to insure a considerable surplus to the city to be\r\nemployed for its improvement, provided they are offered for sale only in\r\nsufficient numbers to meet the existing demand. But the act of 1796\r\nrequires that they shall be positively sold in such numbers as shall be\r\nnecessary for the punctual payment of the loans. Nine thousand dollars\r\nof interest are lately become due, $3,000 quarter yearly will continue\r\nto become due, and $50,000, an additional loan, are reimbursable on the\r\n1st day of November next. These sums would require sales so far beyond\r\nthe actual demand of the market that it is apprehended that the whole\r\nproperty may be thereby sacrificed, the public security destroyed, and\r\nthe residuary interest of the city entirely lost. Under these\r\ncircumstances I have thought it my duty before I proceed to direct a\r\nrigorous execution of the law to submit the subject to the consideration\r\nof the Legislature. Whether the public interest will be better secured\r\nin the end and that of the city saved by offering sales commensurate\r\nonly to the demand at market, and advancing from the Treasury in the\r\nfirst instance what these may prove deficient, to be replaced by\r\nsubsequent sales, rests for the determination of the Legislature. If\r\nindulgence for the funds can be admitted, they will probably form a\r\nresource of great and permanent value; and their embarrassments have\r\nbeen produced only by overstrained exertions to provide accommodations\r\nfor the Government of the Union\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 12, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI now communicate to you a letter from the Secretary of State inclosing\r\nan estimate of the expenses which appear at present necessary for\r\ncarrying into effect the convention between the United States of America\r\nand the French Republic, which has been prepared at the request of the\r\nHouse of Representatives.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 27, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you the accounts of our Indian trading houses, as rendered\r\nup to the 1st day of January, 1801, with a report of the Secretary of\r\nWar thereon, explaining the effects and the situation of that commerce\r\nand the reasons in favor of its further extension. But it is believed\r\nthat the act authorizing this trade expired so long ago as the 3d of\r\nMarch, 1799. Its revival, therefore, as well as its extension, is\r\nsubmitted to the consideration of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe act regulating trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes will\r\nalso expire on the 3d day of March next. While on the subject of its\r\ncontinuance it will be worthy the consideration of the Legislature\r\nwhether the provisions of the law inflicting on Indians, in certain\r\ncases, the punishment of death by hanging might not permit its\r\ncommutation into death by military execution, the form of the punishment\r\nin the former way being peculiarly repugnant to their ideas and\r\nincreasing the obstacles to the surrender of the criminal.\r\n\r\nThese people are becoming very sensible of the baneful effects produced\r\non their morals, their health, and existence by the abuse of ardent\r\nspirits, and some of them earnestly desire a prohibition of that article\r\nfrom being carried among them. The Legislature will consider whether the\r\neffectuating that desire would not be in the spirit of benevolence and\r\nliberality which they have hitherto practiced toward these our\r\nneighbors, and which has had so happy an effect toward conciliating\r\ntheir friendship. It has been found, too, in experience that the same\r\nabuse gives frequent rise to incidents tending much to commit our peace\r\nwith the Indians.\r\n\r\nIt is now become necessary to run and mark the boundaries between them\r\nand us in various parts. The law last mentioned has authorized this to\r\nbe done, but no existing appropriation meets the expense.\r\n\r\nCertain papers explanatory of the grounds of this communication are\r\nherewith inclosed.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 2, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI now lay before you--\r\n\r\n1. A return of ordnance, arms, and military stores the property of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n2. Returns of muskets and bayonets fabricated at the armories of the\r\nUnited States at Springfield and Harpers Ferry, and of the expenditures\r\nat those places; and\r\n\r\n3. An estimate of expenditures which may be necessary for fortifications\r\nand barracks for the present year.\r\n\r\nBesides the permanent magazines established at Springfield, West Point,\r\nand Harpers Ferry, it is thought one should be established in some point\r\nconvenient for the States of North Carolina, South Carolina, and\r\nGeorgia. Such a point will probably be found near the border of the\r\nCarolinas, and some small provision by the Legislature preparatory to\r\nthe establishment will be necessary for the present year.\r\n\r\nWe find the United States in possession of certain iron mines and works\r\nin the county of Berkeley and State of Virginia, purchased, as is\r\npresumable, on the idea of establishing works for the fabrication of\r\ncannon and other military articles by the public. Whether this method of\r\nsupplying what may be wanted will be most advisable or that of\r\npurchasing at market where competition brings everything to its proper\r\nlevel of price and quality is for the Legislature to decide, and if the\r\nlatter alternative be preferred, it will rest for their further\r\nconsideration in what way the subjects of this purchase may be best\r\nemployed or disposed of. The Attorney-General's opinion on the subject\r\nof the title accompanies this.\r\n\r\nThere are in various parts of the United States small parcels of land\r\nwhich have been purchased at different times for cantonments and other\r\nmilitary purposes. Several of them are in situations not likely to be\r\naccommodated to future purposes. The loss of the records prevents a\r\ndetailed statement of these until they can be supplied by inquiry. In\r\nthe meantime, one of them, containing 88 acres, in the county of Essex,\r\nin New Jersey, purchased in 1799 and sold the following year to\r\nCornelius Vermule and Andrew Codmas, though its price has been received,\r\ncan not be conveyed without authority from the Legislature.\r\n\r\nI inclose herewith a letter from the Secretary of War on the subject of\r\nthe islands in the lakes and rivers of our northern boundary, and of\r\ncertain lands in the neighborhood of some of our military posts, on\r\nwhich it may be expedient for the Legislature to make some provisions.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 16, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI now transmit a statement of the expenses incurred by the United States\r\nin their transactions with the Barbary Powers, and a roll of the persons\r\nhaving office or employment under the United States, as was proposed in\r\nmy messages of December 7 and 22. Neither is as perfect as could have\r\nbeen wished, and the latter not so much so as further time and inquiry\r\nmay enable us to make it.\r\n\r\nThe great volume of these communications and the delay it would produce\r\nto make out a second copy will, I trust, be deemed a sufficient reason\r\nfor sending one of them to the one House, and the other to the other,\r\nwith a request that they may be interchanged for mutual information\r\nrather than to subject both to further delay.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 18, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn a message of the 2d instant I inclosed a letter from the Secretary of\r\nWar on the subject of certain lands in the neighborhood of our military\r\nposts on which it might be expedient for the Legislature to make some\r\nprovisions. A letter recently received from the governor of Indiana\r\npresents some further views of the extent to which such provision may be\r\nneeded, I therefore now transmit it for the information of Congress.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 24, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to both Houses of Congress a report of the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury on the subject of our marine hospitals, which appear to\r\nrequire legislative attention.\r\n\r\nAs connected with the same subject, I also inclose information\r\nrespecting the situation of our seamen and boatmen frequenting the port\r\nof New Orleans and suffering there from sickness and the want of\r\naccommodation. There is good reason to believe their numbers greater\r\nthan stated in these papers. When we consider how great a proportion of\r\nthe territory of the United States must communicate with that port\r\nsingly, and how rapidly that territory is increasing its population and\r\nproductions, it may perhaps be thought reasonable to make hospital\r\nprovisions there of a different order from those at foreign ports\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 25, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nNo occasion having arisen since the last account rendered by my\r\npredecessor of making use of any part of the moneys heretofore granted\r\nto defray the contingent charges of the Government, I now transmit to\r\nCongress an official statement thereof to the 31st day of December last,\r\nwhen the whole unexpended balance, amounting to $20,911.80, was carried\r\nto the credit of the surplus fund, as provided for by law, and this\r\naccount consequently becomes finally closed,\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 26, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nSome statements have been lately received of the causes decided or\r\ndepending in the courts of the Union in certain States, supplementary or\r\ncorrective of those from which was formed the general statement\r\naccompanying my message at the opening of the session. I therefore\r\ncommunicate them to Congress, with a report of the Secretary of State\r\nnoting their effect on the former statement and correcting certain\r\nerrors in it which arose partly from inexactitude in some of the returns\r\nand partly in analyzing, adding, and transcribing them while hurried in\r\npreparing the other voluminous papers accompanying that message.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 1, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit for the information of Congress letters recently received\r\nfrom our consuls at Gibraltar and Algiers, presenting the latest view of\r\nthe state of our affairs with the Barbary Powers. The sums due to the\r\nGovernment of Algiers are now fully paid up, and of the gratuity which\r\nhad been promised to that of Tunis, and was in a course of preparation,\r\na small portion only remains still to be finished and delivered.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 9, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nThe governor of New York has desired that, in addition to the\r\nnegotiations with certain Indians already authorized under the\r\nsuperintendence of John Taylor, further negotiations should be held with\r\nthe Oneidas and other members of the Confederacy of the Six Nations for\r\nthe purchase of lands in and for the State of New York, which they are\r\nwilling to sell, as explained in the letter from the Secretary of War\r\nherewith sent. I have therefore thought it better to name a commissioner\r\nto superintend the negotiations specified with the Six Nations\r\ngenerally, or with any of them.\r\n\r\nI do accordingly nominate John Taylor, of New York, to be commissioner\r\nfor the United States, to hold a convention or conventions between the\r\nState of New York and the Confederacy of the Six Nations of Indians, or\r\nany of the nations composing it.\r\n\r\nThis nomination, if advised and consented to by the Senate, will\r\ncomprehend and supersede that of February 1 of the same John Taylor so\r\nfar as it respected the Seneca Indians,\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 10, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI now submit for the ratification of the Senate a treaty entered into\r\nby the commissioners of the United States with the Choctaw Nation of\r\nIndians, and I transmit therewith so much of the instructions to the\r\ncommissioners as related to the Choctaws, with the minutes of their\r\nproceedings and the letter accompanying them.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 29, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State, charged with the civil affairs of the several\r\nTerritories of the United States, has received from the marshal of\r\nColumbia a statement of the condition, unavoidably distressing, of the\r\npersons committed to his custody on civil or criminal process and the\r\nurgency for some legislative provisions for their relief. There are\r\nother important cases wherein the laws of the adjoining States under\r\nwhich the Territory is placed, though adapted to the purposes of those\r\nStates, are insufficient for those of the Territory from the dissimilar\r\nor defective organization of its authorities. The letter and statement\r\nof the marshal and the disquieting state of the Territory generally are\r\nnow submitted to the wisdom and consideration of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 29, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nThe commissioners who were appointed to carry into execution the sixth\r\narticle of the treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation between the\r\nUnited States and His Britannic Majesty having differed in opinion as to\r\nthe objects of that article and discontinued their proceedings, the\r\nExecutive of the United States took early measures, by instructions to\r\nour minister at the British Court, to negotiate explanations of that\r\narticle. This mode of resolving the difficulty, however, proved\r\nunacceptable to the British Government, which chose rather to avoid all\r\nfurther discussion and expense under that article by fixing at a given\r\nsum the amount for which the United States should be held responsible\r\nunder it. Mr. King was consequently authorized to meet this proposition,\r\nand a settlement in this way has been effected by a convention entered\r\ninto with the British Government, and now communicated for your advice\r\nand consent, together with the instructions and correspondence relating\r\nto it. The greater part of these papers being originals, the return of\r\nthem is requested at the convenience of the Senate.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 30, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War has prepared an estimate of expenditures for the\r\nArmy of the United States during the year 1802, conformably to the act\r\nfixing the military peace establishment, which estimate, with his letter\r\naccompanying and explaining it, I now transmit to both Houses of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 31, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAccording to the desire expressed in your resolution of the 23d instant,\r\nI now transmit a report of the Secretary of State, with the letters it\r\nrefers to, shewing the proceedings which have taken place under the\r\nresolution of Congress of the 16th of April, 1800. The term prescribed\r\nfor the execution of the resolution having elapsed before the person\r\nappointed had sat out on the service, I did not deem it justifiable to\r\ncommence a course of expenditure after the expiration of the resolution\r\nauthorizing it. The correspondence which has taken place, having regard\r\nto dates, will place this subject properly under the view of the House\r\nof Representatives.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL, 8, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy as far as it is in my power the desire expressed in\r\nyour resolution of the 6th instant, I now transmit you a letter from\r\nJohn Read, agent for the United States before the board of commissioners\r\nunder the sixth article of the treaty with Great Britain, to the\r\nAttorney-General, bearing date the 25th of April, 1801, in which he\r\ngives a summary view of the proceedings of those commissioners and of\r\nthe principles established or insisted on by a majority of them.\r\n\r\nSupposing it might be practicable for us to settle by negotiation with\r\nGreat Britain the principles which ought to govern the decisions under\r\nthe treaty, I caused instructions to be given to Mr. Read to analyze\r\nthe claims before the board of commissioners, to class them under the\r\nprinciples on which they respectively depended, and to state the sum\r\ndepending on each principle or the amount of each description of debt.\r\nThe object of this was that we might know what principles were most\r\nimportant for us to contend for and what others might be conceded\r\nwithout much injury. He performed this duty, and gave in such a\r\nstatement during the last summer, but the chief clerk of the Secretary\r\nof State's office being absent on account of sickness, and the only\r\nperson acquainted with the arrangement of the papers of the office, this\r\nparticular document can not at this time be found. Having, however,\r\nbeen myself in possession of it a few days after its receipt, I then\r\ntranscribed from it for my own use the recapitulation of the amount of\r\neach description of debt. A copy of this transcript I shall subjoin\r\nhereto, with assurances that it is substantially correct, and with the\r\nhope that it will give a view of the subject sufficiently precise to\r\nfulfill the wishes of the Senate. To save them the delay of waiting till\r\na copy of the agent's letter could be made, I send the original, with\r\nthe request that it may be returned at the convenience of the Senate.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 15, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI now transmit the papers desired in your resolution of the 6th\r\ninstant. Those respecting the _Berceau_ will sufficiently explain\r\nthemselves. The officer charged with her repairs states in his letter,\r\nreceived August 27, 1801, that he had been led by circumstances, which\r\nhe explains, to go considerably beyond his orders. In questions between\r\nnations, who have no common umpire but reason, something must often be\r\nyielded of mutual opinion to enable them to meet in a common point.\r\n\r\nThe allowance which had been proposed to the officers of that vessel\r\nbeing represented as too small for their daily necessities, and still\r\nmore so as the means of paying before their departure debts contracted\r\nwith our citizens for subsistence, it was requested on their behalf that\r\nthe daily pay of each might be the measure of their allowance.\r\n\r\nThis being solicited and reimbursement assumed by the agent of their\r\nnation, I deemed that the indulgence would have a propitious effect in\r\nthe moment of returning friendship. The sum of $870.83 was accordingly\r\nfurnished them for the five months of past captivity and a proportional\r\nallowance authorized until their embarkation.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 20, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit you a report from the Secretary of State, with the\r\ninformation desired by the House of Representatives, of the 8th of\r\nJanuary, relative to certain spoliations and other proceedings therein\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 26, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the act entitled \"An act supplemental to the act\r\nentitled 'An act for an amicable settlement of limits with the State\r\nof Georgia, and authorizing the establishment of a government in the\r\nMississippi Territory,'\" James Madison, Secretary of State, Albert\r\nGallatin, Secretary of the Treasury, and Levi Lincoln, Attorney-General\r\nof the United States, were appointed commissioners to settle by\r\ncompromise with the commissioners appointed by the State of Georgia the\r\nclaims and cession to which the said act has relation.\r\n\r\nArticles of agreement and cession have accordingly been entered into and\r\nsigned by the said commissioners of the United States and of Georgia,\r\nwhich, as they leave a right to Congress to act upon them legislatively\r\nat any time within six months after their date, I have thought it my\r\nduty immediately to communicate to the Legislature.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 27, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe commissioners who were appointed to carry into execution the sixth\r\narticle of the treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation between the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain having differed in their construction\r\nof that article, and separated in consequence of that difference, the\r\nPresident of the United States took immediate measures for obtaining\r\nconventional explanations of that article for the government of the\r\ncommissioners. Finding, however, great difficulties opposed to a\r\nsettlement in that way, he authorized our minister at the Court of\r\nLondon to meet a proposition that the United States by the payment of a\r\nfixed sum should discharge themselves from their responsibility for such\r\ndebts as can not be recovered from the individual debtors. A convention\r\nhas accordingly been signed, fixing the sum to be paid at £600,000 in\r\nthree equal and annual installments, which has been ratified by me with\r\nthe advice and consent of the Senate.\r\n\r\nI now transmit copies thereof to both Houses of Congress, trusting that\r\nin the free exercise of the authority which the Constitution has given\r\nthem on the subject of public expenditures they will deem it for the\r\npublic interest to appropriate the sums necessary for carrying this\r\nconvention into execution.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 15, 1802\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nWhen we assemble together, fellow-citizens, to consider the state of our\r\nbeloved country, our just attentions are first drawn to those pleasing\r\ncircumstances which mark the goodness of that Being from whose favor\r\nthey flow and the large measure of thankfulness we owe for His bounty.\r\nAnother year has come around, and finds us still blessed with peace and\r\nfriendship abroad; law, order, and religion at home; good affection and\r\nharmony with our Indian neighbors; our burthens lightened, yet our\r\nincome sufficient for the public wants, and the produce of the year\r\ngreat beyond example. These, fellow-citizens, are the circumstances\r\nunder which we meet, and we remark with special satisfaction those which\r\nunder the smiles of Providence result from the skill, industry, and\r\norder of our citizens, managing their own affairs in their own way and\r\nfor their own use, unembarrassed by too much regulation, unoppressed by\r\nfiscal exactions.\r\n\r\nOn the restoration of peace in Europe that portion of the general\r\ncarrying trade which had fallen to our share during the war was abridged\r\nby the returning competition of the belligerent powers. This was to\r\nbe expected, and was just. But in addition we find in some parts of\r\nEurope monopolizing discriminations, which in the form of duties tend\r\neffectually to prohibit the carrying thither our own produce in our own\r\nvessels. From existing amities and a spirit of justice it is hoped that\r\nfriendly discussion will produce a fair and adequate reciprocity. But\r\nshould false calculations of interest defeat our hope, it rests with the\r\nLegislature to decide whether they will meet inequalities abroad with\r\ncountervailing inequalities at home, or provide for the evil in any\r\nother way.\r\n\r\nIt is with satisfaction I lay before you an act of the British\r\nParliament anticipating this subject so far as to authorize a mutual\r\nabolition of the duties and countervailing duties permitted under the\r\ntreaty of 1794. It shows on their part a spirit of justice and friendly\r\naccommodation which it is our duty and our interest to cultivate with\r\nall nations. Whether this would produce a due equality in the navigation\r\nbetween the two countries is a subject for your consideration.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance which claims attention as directly affecting the\r\nvery source of our navigation is the defect or the evasion of the law\r\nproviding for the return of seamen, and particularly of those belonging\r\nto vessels sold abroad. Numbers of them, discharged in foreign ports,\r\nhave been thrown on the hands of our consuls, who, to rescue them from\r\nthe dangers into which their distresses might plunge them and save them\r\nto their country, have found it necessary in some cases to return them\r\nat the public charge.\r\n\r\nThe cession of the Spanish Province of Louisiana to France, which took\r\nplace in the course of the late war, will, if carried into effect, make\r\na change in the aspect of our foreign relations which will doubtless\r\nhave just weight in any deliberations of the Legislature connected with\r\nthat subject.\r\n\r\nThere was reason not long since to apprehend that the warfare in which\r\nwe were engaged with Tripoli might be taken up by some other of the\r\nBarbary Powers. A reenforcement, therefore, was immediately ordered to\r\nthe vessels already there. Subsequent information, however, has removed\r\nthese apprehensions for the present. To secure our commerce in that sea\r\nwith the smallest force competent, we have supposed it best to watch\r\nstrictly the harbor of Tripoli. Still, however, the shallowness of their\r\ncoast and the want of smaller vessels on our part has permitted some\r\ncruisers to escape unobserved, and to one of these an American vessel\r\nunfortunately fell a prey. The captain, one American seaman, and two\r\nothers of color remain prisoners with them unless exchanged under an\r\nagreement formerly made with the Bashaw, to whom, on the faith of that,\r\nsome of his captive subjects had been restored.\r\n\r\nThe convention with the State of Georgia has been ratified by their\r\nlegislature, and a repurchase from the Creeks has been consequently made\r\nof a part of the Talasscee country. In this purchase has been also\r\ncomprehended a part of the lands within the fork of Oconee and Oakmulgee\r\nrivers. The particulars of the contract will be laid before Congress so\r\nsoon as they shall be in a state for communication.\r\n\r\nIn order to remove every ground of difference possible with our Indian\r\nneighbors, I have proceeded in the work of settling with them and\r\nmarking the boundaries between us. That with the Choctaw Nation is fixed\r\nin one part and will be through the whole within a short time. The\r\ncountry to which their title had been extinguished before the Revolution\r\nis sufficient to receive a very respectable population, which Congress\r\nwill probably see the expediency of encouraging so soon as the limits\r\nshall be declared. We are to view this position as an outpost of the\r\nUnited States, surrounded by strong neighbors and distant from its\r\nsupport; and how far that monopoly which prevents population should\r\nhere be guarded against and actual habitation made a condition of\r\nthe continuance of title will be for your consideration. A prompt\r\nsettlement, too, of all existing rights and claims within this territory\r\npresents itself as a preliminary operation.\r\n\r\nIn that part of the Indiana Territory which includes Vincennes the lines\r\nsettled with the neighboring tribes fix the extinction of their title\r\nat a breadth of 24 leagues from east to west and about the same length\r\nparallel with and including the Wabash. They have also ceded a tract of\r\n4 miles square, including the salt springs near the mouth of that river.\r\n\r\nIn the Department of Finance it is with pleasure I inform you that the\r\nreceipts of external duties for the last twelve months have exceeded\r\nthose of any former year, and that the ratio of increase has been also\r\ngreater than usual. This has enabled us to answer all the regular\r\nexigencies of Government, to pay from the Treasury within one year\r\nupward of $8,000,000, principal and interest, of the public debt,\r\nexclusive of upward of one million paid by the sale of bank stock, and\r\nmaking in the whole a reduction of nearly five millions and a half of\r\nprincipal, and to have now in the Treasury $4,500,000, which are in a\r\ncourse of application to the further discharge of debt and current\r\ndemands. Experience, too, so far, authorizes us to believe, if no\r\nextraordinary event supervenes, and the expenses which will be actually\r\nincurred shall not be greater than were contemplated by Congress\r\nat their last session, that we shall not be disappointed in the\r\nexpectations then formed. But nevertheless, as the effect of peace\r\non the amount of duties is not yet fully ascertained, it is the more\r\nnecessary to practice every useful economy and to incur no expense which\r\nmay be avoided without prejudice.\r\n\r\nThe collection of the internal taxes having been completed in some of\r\nthe States, the officers employed in it are of course out of commission.\r\nIn others they will be so shortly. But in a few, where the arrangements\r\nfor the direct tax had been retarded, it will be some time before the\r\nsystem is closed. It has not yet been thought necessary to employ the\r\nagent authorized by an act of the last session for transacting business\r\nin Europe relative to debts and loans. Nor have we used the power\r\nconfided by the same act of prolonging the foreign debt by reloans, and\r\nof redeeming instead thereof an equal sum of the domestic debt. Should,\r\nhowever, the difficulties of remittance on so large a scale render it\r\nnecessary at any time, the power shall be executed and the money thus\r\nunemployed abroad shall, in conformity with that law, be faithfully\r\napplied here in an equivalent extinction of domestic debt. When effects\r\nso salutary result from the plans you have already sanctioned; when\r\nmerely by avoiding false objects of expense we are able, without a\r\ndirect tax, without internal taxes, and without borrowing to make large\r\nand effectual payments toward the discharge of our public debt and\r\nthe emancipation of our posterity from that mortal canker, it is an\r\nencouragement, fellow-citizens, of the highest order to proceed as we\r\nhave begun in substituting economy for taxation, and in pursuing what is\r\nuseful for a nation placed as we are, rather than what is practiced by\r\nothers under different circumstances. And whensoever we are destined to\r\nmeet events which shall call forth all the energies of our countrymen,\r\nwe have the firmest reliance on those energies and the comfort of\r\nleaving for calls like these the extraordinary resources of loans and\r\ninternal taxes. In the meantime, by payments of the principal of our\r\ndebt, we are liberating annually portions of the external taxes and\r\nforming from them a growing fund still further to lessen the necessity\r\nof recurring to extraordinary resources.\r\n\r\nThe usual account of receipts and expenditures for the last year, with\r\nan estimate of the expenses of the ensuing one, will be laid before you\r\nby the Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nNo change being deemed necessary in our military establishment, an\r\nestimate of its expenses for the ensuing year on its present footing,\r\nas also of the sums to be employed in fortifications and other objects\r\nwithin that department, has been prepared by the Secretary of War, and\r\nwill make a part of the general estimates which will be presented you.\r\n\r\nConsidering that our regular troops are employed for local purposes,\r\nand that the militia is our general reliance for great and sudden\r\nemergencies, you will doubtless think this institution worthy of a\r\nreview, and give it those improvements of which you find it susceptible.\r\n\r\nEstimates for the Naval Department, prepared by the Secretary of the\r\nNavy, for another year will in like manner be communicated with the\r\ngeneral estimates. A small force in the Mediterranean will still be\r\nnecessary to restrain the Tripoline cruisers, and the uncertain tenure\r\nof peace with some other of the Barbary Powers may eventually require\r\nthat force to be augmented. The necessity of procuring some smaller\r\nvessels for that service will raise the estimate, but the difference\r\nin their maintenance will soon make it a measure of economy.\r\n\r\nPresuming it will be deemed expedient to expend annually a convenient\r\nsum toward providing the naval defense which our situation may require,\r\nI can not but recommend that the first appropriations for that purpose\r\nmay go to the saving what we already possess. No cares, no attentions,\r\ncan preserve vessels from rapid decay which lie in water and exposed\r\nto the sun. These decays require great and constant repairs, and will\r\nconsume, if continued, a great portion of the moneys destined to naval\r\npurposes. To avoid this waste of our resources it is proposed to add\r\nto our navy-yard here a dock within which our present vessels may be\r\nlaid up dry and under cover from the sun. Under these circumstances\r\nexperience proves that works of wood will remain scarcely at all\r\naffected by time. The great abundance of running water which this\r\nsituation possesses, at heights far above the level of the tide, if\r\nemployed as is practiced for lock navigation, furnishes the means for\r\nraising and laying up our vessels on a dry and sheltered bed. And should\r\nthe measure be found useful here, similar depositories for laying up as\r\nwell as for building and repairing vessels may hereafter be undertaken\r\nat other navy-yards offering the same means. The plans and estimates\r\nof the work, prepared by a person of skill and experience, will be\r\npresented to you without delay, and from this it will be seen that\r\nscarcely more than has been the cost of one vessel is necessary to save\r\nthe whole, and that the annual sum to be employed toward its completion\r\nmay be adapted to the views of the Legislature as to naval expenditure.\r\n\r\nTo cultivate peace and maintain commerce and navigation in all their\r\nlawful enterprises; to foster our fisheries as nurseries of navigation\r\nand for the nurture of man, and protect the manufactures adapted to our\r\ncircumstances; to preserve the faith of the nation by an exact discharge\r\nof its debts and contracts, expend the public money with the same care\r\nand economy we would practice with our own, and impose on our citizens\r\nno unnecessary burthens; to keep in all things within the pale of our\r\nconstitutional powers, and cherish the federal union as the only rock\r\nof safety--these, fellow-citizens, are the landmarks by which we are to\r\nguide our selves in all our proceedings. By continuing to make these the\r\nrule of our action we shall endear to our countrymen the true principles\r\nof their Constitution and promote an union of sentiment and of action\r\nequally auspicious to their happiness and safety. On my part, you may\r\ncount on a cordial concurrence in every measure for the public good and\r\non all the information I possess which may enable you to discharge to\r\nadvantage the high functions with which you are invested by your\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 22, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI now transmit a report from the Secretary of State with the information\r\nrequested in your resolution of the 17th instant.\r\n\r\nIn making this communication I deem it proper to observe that I was led\r\nby the regard due to the rights and interests of the United States and\r\nto the just sensibility of the portion of our fellow-citizens more\r\nimmediately affected by the irregular proceeding at New Orleans to lose\r\nnot a moment in causing every step to be taken which the occasion\r\nclaimed from me, being equally aware of the obligation to maintain in\r\nall cases the rights of the nation and to employ for that purpose those\r\njust and honorable means which belong to the character of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 23, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 3d\r\nof May last, desiring a statement of expenditures from January 1, 1797,\r\nby the Quartermaster-General and the navy agents, for the contingencies\r\nof the naval and military establishments and the navy contracts for\r\ntimber and stores, I now transmit such statements from the offices of\r\nthe Secretaries of the Treasury, War, and Navy, where alone these\r\nexpenditures are entered.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 27, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you a treaty, which has been agreed to by commissioners\r\nduly authorized on the part of the United States and the Creek Nation\r\nof Indians, for the extinguishment of the native title to lands in the\r\nTalassee County, and others between the forks of Oconce and Oakmulgee\r\nrivers, in Georgia, in pursuance of the convention with that State,\r\ntogether with the documents explanatory thereof; and it is submitted\r\nto your determination whether you will advise and consent to the\r\nratification thereof.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 27, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you a treaty, which has been concluded between the State of\r\nNew York and the Oneida Indians, for the purchase of lands within that\r\nState.\r\n\r\nOne other, between the same State and the Seneca Indians, for the\r\npurchase of other lands within the same State.\r\n\r\nOne other, between certain individuals styled the Holland Company with\r\nthe Senecas, for the exchange of certain lands in the same State.\r\n\r\nAnd one other, between Oliver Phelps, a citizen of the United States,\r\nand the Senecas, for the exchange of lands in the same State; with\r\nsundry explanatory papers, all of them conducted under the\r\nsuperintendence of a commissioner on the part of the United States, who\r\nreports that they have been adjusted with the fair and free consent\r\nand understanding of the parties. It is therefore submitted to your\r\ndetermination whether you will advise and consent to their respective\r\nratifications.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 27, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn my message of the 15th instant I mentioned that plans and estimates\r\nof a dry dock for the preservation of our ships of war, prepared by a\r\nperson of skill and experience, should be laid before you without delay.\r\nThese are now transmitted, the report and estimates by duplicates; but\r\nthe plans being single only, I must request an intercommunication of\r\nthem between the Houses and their return when they shall no longer be\r\nwanting for their consideration.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 30, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn addition to the information accompanying my message of the 22d\r\ninstant, I now transmit the copy of a letter on the same subject,\r\nrecently received.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 30, 1802_.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\nSIR: Although an informal communication to the public of the substance\r\nof the inclosed letter may be proper for quieting the public mind, yet I\r\nrefer to the consideration of the House of Representatives whether the\r\npublication of it in form might not give dissatisfaction to the writer\r\nand tend to discourage the freedom and confidence of communications\r\nbetween the agents of the two Governments. Accept assurances of my high\r\nconsideration and respect.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATCHEZ, _November 25, 1802_.\r\n\r\nThe Honorable the Secretary of State,\r\n\r\n_Washington_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to inclose you an original copy of a communication\r\n(together with a translation thereof) which I this morning received\r\nfrom the governor-general of the Province of Louisiana in answer to my\r\nletters of the 28th ultimo.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, with respect and esteem, your humble servant,\r\n\r\nWILLIAM C.C. CLAIBORNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Translation.]\r\n\r\nNew Orleans, _November 15, 1802_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency WILLIAM C.C. CLAIBORNE.\r\n\r\nMost Excellent Sir: I received a few days past your excellency's\r\nesteemed letter of the 28th ultimo, in which your excellency, referring\r\nto the twenty-second article of the treaty of friendship, navigation,\r\nand limits agreed upon between the King, my master, and the United\r\nStates of America, has been pleased to inquire, after transcribing the\r\nliteral text of said article (which you find so explicit as not to\r\nrequire any comment nor to admit of dubious construction), if His\r\nMajesty has been pleased to designate any other position on the banks\r\nof the Mississippi, and where that is, if his royal pleasure does not\r\ncontinue the permission stipulated by the said treaty which entitled the\r\ncitizens of the United States to deposit their merchandise and effects\r\nin the port of New Orleans; and you request at the same time that, as\r\nthe affair is so interesting to the commerce of the United States and\r\nto the welfare of its citizens, I may do you the favor to send you an\r\nanswer as early as possible. I can now assure your excellency that His\r\nCatholic Majesty has not hitherto issued any order for suspending the\r\ndeposit, and consequently has not designated any other position on the\r\nbanks of the Mississippi for that purpose. But I must inform you, in\r\nanswer to your inquiry, that the intendant of these provinces (who\r\nin the affairs of his own department is independent of the general\r\nGovernment), at the same time that, in conformity with the royal\r\ncommands (the peace in Europe having been published since the 4th of May\r\nlast), he suspended the commerce of neutrals, also thought proper to\r\nsuspend the tacit prolongation which continued, and to put a stop to\r\nthe infinite abuses which resulted from the deposit, contrary to the\r\ninterest of the State and of the commerce of these colonies, in\r\nconsequence of the experience he acquired of the frauds which have been\r\ncommitted and which it has been endeavored to excuse under the pretext\r\nof ignorance, as is manifested by the number of causes which now await\r\nthe determination of His Majesty, as soon as they can be brought to his\r\nroyal knowledge, besides many others which have been dropt because the\r\nindividuals have absconded who introduced their properties into the\r\ndeposit and did not extract them, thus defrauding the royal interests.\r\n\r\nIt might appear on the first view that particular cases like these ought\r\nnot to operate against a general privilege granted by a solemn treaty,\r\nand it is an incontestable principle that the happiness of nations\r\nconsists in a great measure in maintaining a good harmony and\r\ncorrespondence with their neighbors by respecting their rights, by\r\nsupporting their own, without being deficient in what is required by\r\nhumanity and civil intercourse; but it is also indubitable that for a\r\ntreaty, although solemn, to be entirely valid it ought not to contain\r\nany defect; and if it be pernicious and of an injurious tendency,\r\nalthough it has been effectuated with good faith but without a knowledge\r\nof its bad consequence, it will be necessary to undo it, because\r\ntreaties ought to be viewed like other acts of public will, in which\r\nmore attention ought to be paid to the intention than to the words in\r\nwhich they are expressed; and thus it will not appear so repugnant\r\nthat the term of three years fixed by the twenty-second article being\r\ncompleted without the King's having granted a prolongation, the\r\nintendancy should not, after putting a stop to the commerce of neutrals,\r\ntake upon itself the responsibility of continuing that favor without the\r\nexpress mandate of the King, a circumstance equally indispensable for\r\ndesignating another place on the banks of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing I trust that you will infer that as it is the duty of\r\nthe intendant, who conducts the business of his ministry with a perfect\r\nindependence of the Government, to have informed the King of what he has\r\ndone in fulfillment of what has been expressly stipulated, it is to be\r\nhoped that His Majesty will take the measures which are convenient to\r\ngive effect to the deposit, either in this capital, if he should not\r\nfind it prejudicial to the interests of Spain, or in the place on\r\nthe banks of the Mississippi which it may be his royal pleasure to\r\ndesignate; as it ought to be confided that the justice and generosity\r\nof the King will not refuse to afford to the American citizens all\r\nthe advantages they can desire, a measure which does not depend upon\r\ndiscretion, nor can an individual chief take it upon himself. Besides\r\nthese principles on which the regulation of the intendant is founded, I\r\nought at the same time to inform you that I myself opposed on my part,\r\nas far as I reasonably could, the measure of suspending the deposit,\r\nuntil the reasons adduced by the intendant brought it to my view; that\r\nas all events can not be prevented, and as with time and different\r\ncircumstances various others occur which can not be foreseen, a just\r\nand rational interpretation is always necessary. Notwithstanding the\r\nforegoing, the result of my own reflections, I immediately consulted on\r\nthe occasion with my captain-general, whose answer, which can not be\r\nlong delayed, will dissipate every doubt that may be raised concerning\r\nthe steps which are to be taken, By all means your excellency may live\r\nin the firm persuasion that as there has subsisted, and does subsist,\r\nthe most perfect and constant good harmony between the King, my master,\r\nand the United States of America, I will spare no pains to preserve it\r\nby all the means in my power, being assured of a reciprocity of equal\r\ngood offices in observing the treaty with good faith, ever keeping it in\r\nview that the felicity and glory of nations are deeply concerned in the\r\nadvantages of a wise and prudently conducted commerce.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to assure your excellency of the respect and high\r\nconsideration which I profess for you; and I pray the Most High to\r\npreserve your life many years.\r\n\r\nI kiss your excellency's hands.\r\n\r\nYour most affectionate servant,\r\n\r\nMANUEL DE SALCEDO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 5, 1803.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAgreeably to the request of the House of Representatives, I now transmit\r\na statement of the militia of those States from which any returns have\r\nbeen made to the War Office. They are, as you will perceive, but a small\r\nproportion of the whole. I send you also the copy of a circular letter\r\nwritten some time since for the purpose of obtaining returns from all\r\nthe States. Should any others in consequence of this be made during the\r\nsession of Congress, they shall be immediately communicated.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 7, 1803.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI submit for your approbation and consent a convention entered into with\r\nthe Choctaw Nation of Indians for ascertaining and marking the limits of\r\nthe territory ceded to our nation while under its former government, and\r\nlying between the Tombigbee and Mobile rivers on the east and the\r\nChickasawhay River on the west.\r\n\r\nWe are now engaged in ascertaining and marking in like manner the limits\r\nof the former cessions of the Choctaws from the river Yazoo to our\r\nsouthern boundary, which will be the subject of another convention,\r\nand we expect to obtain from the same nation a new cession of lands\r\nof considerable extent between the Tombigbee and Alabama rivers.\r\n\r\nThese several tracts of country will compose that portion of the\r\nMississippi Territory which, so soon as certain individual claims are\r\narranged, the United States will be free to sell and settle immediately.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 11, 1803.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nThe cession of the Spanish Province of Louisiana to France, and perhaps\r\nof the Floridas, and the late suspension of our right of deposit at New\r\nOrleans are events of primary interest to the United States. On both\r\noccasions such measures were promptly taken as were thought most\r\nlikely amicably to remove the present and to prevent future causes of\r\ninquietude. The objects of these measures were to obtain the territory\r\non the left bank of the Mississippi and eastward of that, if\r\npracticable, on conditions to which the proper authorities of our\r\ncountry would agree, or at least to prevent any changes which might\r\nlessen the secure exercise of our rights. While my confidence in our\r\nminister plenipotentiary at Paris is entire and undiminished, I still\r\nthink that these objects might be promoted by joining with him a person\r\nsent from hence directly, carrying with him the feelings and sentiments\r\nof the nation excited on the late occurrence, impressed by full\r\ncommunications of all the views we entertain on this interesting\r\nsubject, and thus prepared to meet and to improve to an useful result\r\nthe counter propositions of the other contracting party, whatsoever form\r\ntheir interests may give to them, and to secure to us the ultimate\r\naccomplishment of our object.\r\n\r\nI therefore nominate Robert R. Livingston to be minister plenipotentiary\r\nand James Monroe to be minister extraordinary and plenipotentiary, with\r\nfull powers to both jointly, or to either on the death of the other, to\r\nenter into a treaty or convention with the First Consul of France for\r\nthe purpose of enlarging and more effectually securing our rights and\r\ninterests in the river Mississippi and in the Territories eastward\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nBut as the possession of these provinces is still in Spain, and the\r\ncourse of events may retard or prevent the cession to France being\r\ncarried into effect, to secure our object it will be expedient to\r\naddress equal powers to the Government of Spain also, to be used only\r\nin the event of its being necessary.\r\n\r\nI therefore nominate Charles Pinckney to be minister plenipotentiary,\r\nand James Monroe, of Virginia, to be minister extraordinary and\r\nplenipotentiary, with full powers to both jointly, or to either on the\r\ndeath of the other, to enter into a treaty or convention with His\r\nCatholic Majesty for the purpose of enlarging and more effectually\r\nsecuring our rights and interests in the river Mississippi and in the\r\nTerritories eastward thereof.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 11, 1803.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nThe spoliations and irregularities committed on our commerce during\r\nthe late war by subjects of Spain or by others deemed within her\r\nresponsibility having called for attention, instructions were\r\naccordingly given to our minister at Madrid to urge our right to just\r\nindemnifications, and to propose a convention for adjusting them. The\r\nSpanish Government listened to our proposition with an honorable\r\nreadiness and agreed to a convention, which I now submit for your advice\r\nand consent. It does not go to the satisfaction of all our claims, but\r\nthe express reservation of our right to press the validity of the\r\nresidue has been made the ground of further instructions to our minister\r\non the subject of an additional article, which it is to be hoped will\r\nnot be without effect.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 18, 1803.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAs the continuance of the act for establishing trading houses with the\r\nIndian tribes will be under the consideration of the Legislature at its\r\npresent session, I think it my duty to communicate the views which have\r\nguided me in the execution of that act, in order that you may decide\r\non the policy of continuing it in the present or any other form, or\r\ndiscontinue it altogether if that shall, on the whole, seem most for\r\nthe public good.\r\n\r\nThe Indian tribes residing within the limits of the United States\r\nhave for a considerable time been growing more and more uneasy at the\r\nconstant diminution of the territory they occupy, although effected by\r\ntheir own voluntary sales, and the policy has long been gaining strength\r\nwith them of refusing absolutely all further sale on any conditions,\r\ninsomuch that at this time it hazards their friendship and excites\r\ndangerous jealousies and perturbations in their minds to make any\r\noverture for the purchase of the smallest portions of their land. A\r\nvery few tribes only are not yet obstinately in these dispositions. In\r\norder peaceably to counteract this policy of theirs and to provide an\r\nextension of territory which the rapid increase of our numbers will call\r\nfor, two measures are deemed expedient. First. To encourage them to\r\nabandon hunting, to apply to the raising stock, to agriculture, and\r\ndomestic manufacture, and thereby prove to themselves that less land and\r\nlabor will maintain them in this better than in their former mode of\r\nliving. The extensive forests necessary in the hunting life will then\r\nbecome useless, and they will see advantage in exchanging them for\r\nthe means of improving their farms and of increasing their domestic\r\ncomforts. Secondly. To multiply trading houses among them, and place\r\nwithin their reach those things which will contribute more to their\r\ndomestic comfort than the possession of extensive but uncultivated\r\nwilds. Experience and reflection will develop to them the wisdom of\r\nexchanging what they can spare and we want for what we can spare and\r\nthey want. In leading them thus to agriculture, to manufactures, and\r\ncivilization; in bringing together their and our sentiments, and\r\nin preparing them ultimately to participate in the benefits of our\r\nGovernment, I trust and believe we are acting for their greatest good.\r\nAt these trading houses we have pursued the principles of the act of\r\nCongress which directs that the commerce shall be carried on liberally,\r\nand requires only that the capital stock shall not be diminished. We\r\nconsequently undersell private traders, foreign and domestic, drive them\r\nfrom the competition, and thus, with the good will of the Indians, rid\r\nourselves of a description of men who are constantly endeavoring to\r\nexcite in the Indian mind suspicions, fears, and irritations toward us.\r\nA letter now inclosed shows the effect of our competition on the\r\noperations of the traders, while the Indians, perceiving the advantage\r\nof purchasing from us, are soliciting generally our establishment\r\nof trading houses among them. In one quarter this is particularly\r\ninteresting. The legislature, reflecting on the late occurrences on\r\nthe Mississippi, must be sensible how desirable it is to possess a\r\nrespectable breadth of country on that river, from our southern limit to\r\nthe Illinois, at least, so that we may present as firm a front on that\r\nas on our eastern border. We possess what is below the Yazoo, and can\r\nprobably acquire a certain breadth from the Illinois and Wabash to the\r\nOhio; but between the Ohio and Yazoo the country all belongs to the\r\nChickasaws, the most friendly tribe within our limits, but the most\r\ndecided against the alienation of lands. The portion of their country\r\nmost important for us is exactly that which they do not inhabit. Their\r\nsettlements are not on the Mississippi, but in the interior country.\r\nThey have lately shown a desire to become agricultural, and this leads\r\nto the desire of buying implements and comforts. In the strengthening\r\nand gratifying of these wants I see the only prospect of planting on the\r\nMississippi itself the means of its own safety. Duty has required me to\r\nsubmit these views to the judgment of the Legislature, but as their\r\ndisclosure might embarrass and defeat their effect, they are committed\r\nto the special confidence of the two Houses.\r\n\r\nWhile the extension of the public commerce among the Indian tribes may\r\ndeprive of that source of profit such of our citizens as are engaged\r\nin it, it might be worthy the attention of Congress in their care of\r\nindividual as well as of the general interest to point in another\r\ndirection the enterprise of these citizens, as profitably for themselves\r\nand more usefully for the public. The river Missouri and the Indians\r\ninhabiting it are not as well known as is rendered desirable by their\r\nconnection with the Mississippi, and consequently with us. It is,\r\nhowever, understood that the country on that river is inhabited by\r\nnumerous tribes, who furnish great supplies of furs and peltry to the\r\ntrade of another nation, carried on in a high latitude through an\r\ninfinite number of portages and lakes shut up by ice through a long\r\nseason. The commerce on that line could bear no competition with that of\r\nthe Missouri, traversing a moderate climate, offering, according to the\r\nbest accounts, a continued navigation from its source, and possibly with\r\na single portage from the Western Ocean, and finding to the Atlantic a\r\nchoice of channels through the Illinois or Wabash, the Lakes and Hudson,\r\nthrough the Ohio and Susquehanna, or Potomac or James rivers, and\r\nthrough the Tennessee and Savannah rivers. An intelligent officer,\r\nwith ten or twelve chosen men, fit for the enterprise and willing to\r\nundertake it, taken from our posts where they may be spared without\r\ninconvenience, might explore the whole line, even to the Western\r\nOcean, have conferences with the natives on the subject of commercial\r\nintercourse, get admission among them for our traders as others are\r\nadmitted, agree on convenient deposits for an interchange of articles,\r\nand return with the information acquired in the course of two summers.\r\nTheir arms and accouterments, some instruments of observation, and light\r\nand cheap presents for the Indians would be all the apparatus they could\r\ncarry, and with an expectation of a soldier's portion of land on their\r\nreturn would constitute the whole expense. Their pay would be going on\r\nwhether here or there. While other civilized nations have encountered\r\ngreat expense to enlarge the boundaries of knowledge by undertaking\r\nvoyages of discovery, and for other literary purposes, in various parts\r\nand directions, our nation seems to owe to the same object, as well\r\nas to its own interests, to explore this the only line of easy\r\ncommunication across the continent, and so directly traversing our own\r\npart of it. The interests of commerce place the principal object within\r\nthe constitutional powers and care of Congress, and that it should\r\nincidentally advance the geographical knowledge of our own continent\r\ncan not but be an additional gratification. The nation claiming the\r\nterritory, regarding this as a literary pursuit, which it is in the\r\nhabit of permitting within its dominions, would not be disposed to view\r\nit with jealousy, even if the expiring state of its interests there did\r\nnot render it a matter of indifference. The appropriation of $2,500 \"for\r\nthe purpose of extending the external commerce of the United States,\"\r\nwhile understood and considered by the Executive as giving the\r\nlegislative sanction, would cover the undertaking from notice and\r\nprevent the obstructions which interested individuals might otherwise\r\npreviously prepare in its way.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 18, 1803.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI inclose a report of the Secretary of War, stating the trading houses\r\nestablished in the Indian territories, the progress which has been made\r\nin the course of the last year in settling and marking boundaries with\r\nthe different tribes, the purchases of lands recently made from them,\r\nand the prospect of further progress in marking boundaries and in new\r\nextinguishments of title in the year to come, for which some\r\nappropriations of money will be wanting.\r\n\r\nTo this I have to add that when the Indians ceded to us the salt springs\r\non the Wabash they expressed a hope that we would so employ them as to\r\nenable them to procure there the necessary supplies of salt. Indeed, it\r\nwould be the most proper and acceptable form in which the annuity could\r\nbe paid which we propose to give them for the cession. These springs\r\nmight at the same time be rendered eminently serviceable to our Western\r\ninhabitants by using them as the means of counteracting the monopolies\r\nof supplies of salt and of reducing the price in that country to a just\r\nlevel. For these purposes a small appropriation would be necessary to\r\nmeet the first expenses, after which they should support themselves and\r\nrepay those advances. These springs are said to possess the advantage of\r\nbeing accompanied with a bed of coal.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 19, 1803.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI now lay before Congress the annual account of the fund established\r\nfor defraying the contingent charges of Government. A single article of\r\n$1,440, paid for bringing home 72 seamen discharged in foreign ports\r\nfrom vessels sold abroad, is the only expenditure from that fund,\r\nleaving an unexpended balance of $18,560 in the Treasury.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 24. 1803.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a report by the superintendent of the city of Washington on\r\nthe affairs of the city committed to his care. By this you will perceive\r\nthat the resales of lots prescribed by an act of the last session of\r\nCongress did not produce a sufficiency to pay the debt to Maryland\r\nto which they are appropriated, and as it was evident that the sums\r\nnecessary for the interest and installments due to that State could not\r\nbe produced by a sale of the other public lots without an unwarrantable\r\nsacrifice of the property, the deficiencies were of necessity drawn from\r\nthe Treasury of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe office of the surveyor for the city, created during the former\r\nestablishment, being of indispensable necessity, it has been continued,\r\nand to that of the superintendent, substituted instead of the board of\r\ncommissioners at the last session of Congress, no salary was annexed by\r\nlaw. These offices being permanent, I have supposed it more agreeable to\r\nprinciple that their salaries should be fixed by the Legislature, and\r\ntherefore have assigned them none. Their services to be compensated are\r\nfrom the 1st day of June last.\r\n\r\nThe marshal of the District of Columbia has, as directed by law, caused\r\na jail to be built in the city of Washington. I inclose his statements\r\nof the expenses already incurred and of what remains to be finished. The\r\nportion actually completed has rendered the situation of the persons\r\nconfined much more comfortable and secure than it has been heretofore.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 3, 1803.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe inclosed letter and affidavits exhibiting matter of complaint against\r\nJohn Pickering, district judge of New Hampshire, which is not within\r\nExecutive cognizance, I transmit them to the House of Representatives,\r\nto whom the Constitution has confided a power of instituting proceedings\r\nof redress, if they shall be of opinion that the case calls for them.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 14, 1803.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the ordinance for the government of the Territories of\r\nthe United States requiring that the laws adopted by the governor and\r\njudges thereof shall be reported to Congress from time to time, I now\r\ntransmit those which have been adopted in the Indiana Territory from\r\nJanuary, 1801, to February, 1802, as forwarded to the office of the\r\nSecretary of State.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 21, 1803.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nThe Tuscarora Indians, having an interest in some lands within the State\r\nof North Carolina, asked the superintendence of the Government of the\r\nUnited States over a treaty to be held between them and the State of\r\nNorth Carolina respecting these lands. William Richardson Davie was\r\nappointed a commissioner for this purpose, and a treaty was concluded\r\nunder his superintendence. This, with his letter on the subject, is now\r\nlaid before the Senate for their advice and consent whether it shall be\r\nratified.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 23, 1803.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you a report of the Secretary of State on the case of\r\nthe Danish brigantine _Henrick_, taken by a French privateer in 1799,\r\nretaken by an armed vessel of the United States, carried into a British\r\nisland, and there adjudged to be neutral, but under allowance of such\r\nsalvage and costs as absorbed nearly the whole amount of sales of\r\nthe vessel and cargo. Indemnification for these losses occasioned\r\nby our officers is now claimed by the sufferers, supported by the\r\nrepresentations of their Government. I have no doubt the legislature\r\nwill give to the subject that just attention and consideration which\r\nit is useful as well as honorable to practice in our transactions with\r\nother nations, and particularly with one which has observed toward us\r\nthe most friendly treatment and regard.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From the National Intelligencer, July 18, 1803.]\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas great and weighty matters claiming the consideration of the\r\nCongress of the United States form an extraordinary occasion for\r\nconvening them, I do by these presents appoint Monday, the 17th day\r\nof October next, for their meeting at the city of Washington, hereby\r\nrequiring their respective Senators and Representatives then and there\r\nto assemble in Congress, in order to receive such communications as may\r\nthen be made to them and to consult and determine on such measures as in\r\ntheir wisdom may be deemed meet for the welfare of the United States.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be\r\nhereunto affixed, and signed the same with my hand.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, the 16th day of July, A.D. 1803, and\r\nin the twenty-eighth year of the Independence of the United States.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JAMES MADISON,\r\n    _Secretary_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 17, 1803.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn calling you together, fellow-citizens, at an earlier day than was\r\ncontemplated by the act of the last session of Congress, I have not been\r\ninsensible to the personal inconveniences necessarily resulting from\r\nan unexpected change in your arrangements. But matters of great public\r\nconcernment have rendered this call necessary, and the interests you\r\nfeel in these will supersede in your minds all private considerations.\r\n\r\nCongress witnessed at their late session the extraordinary agitation\r\nproduced in the public mind by the suspension of our right of deposit at\r\nthe port of New Orleans, no assignment of another place having been made\r\naccording to treaty. They were sensible that the continuance of that\r\nprivation would be more injurious to our nation than any consequences\r\nwhich could flow from any mode of redress, but reposing just confidence\r\nin the good faith of the Government whose officer had committed the\r\nwrong, friendly and reasonable representations were resorted to, and\r\nthe right of deposit was restored.\r\n\r\nPrevious, however, to this period we had not been unaware of the danger\r\nto which our peace would be perpetually exposed whilst so important a\r\nkey to the commerce of the Western country remained under foreign power.\r\nDifficulties, too, were presenting themselves as to the navigation of\r\nother streams which, arising within our territories, pass through those\r\nadjacent. Propositions had therefore been authorized for obtaining on\r\nfair conditions the sovereignty of New Orleans and of other possessions\r\nin that quarter interesting to our quiet to such extent as was deemed\r\npracticable, and the provisional appropriation of $2,000,000 to be\r\napplied and accounted for by the President of the United States,\r\nintended as part of the price, was considered as conveying the sanction\r\nof Congress to the acquisition proposed. The enlightened Government of\r\nFrance saw with just discernment the importance to both nations of such\r\nliberal arrangements as might best and permanently promote the peace,\r\nfriendship, and interests of both, and the property and sovereignty of\r\nall Louisiana which had been restored to them have on certain conditions\r\nbeen transferred to the United States by instruments bearing date the\r\n30th of April last. When these shall have received the constitutional\r\nsanction of the Senate, they will without delay be communicated to the\r\nRepresentatives also for the exercise of their functions as to those\r\nconditions which are within the powers vested by the Constitution in\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nWhilst the property and sovereignty of the Mississippi and its waters\r\nsecure an independent outlet for the produce of the Western States\r\nand an uncontrolled navigation through their whole course, free from\r\ncollision with other powers and the dangers to our peace from that\r\nsource, the fertility of the country, its climate and extent, promise\r\nin due season important aids to our Treasury, an ample provision for\r\nour posterity, and a wide spread for the blessings of freedom and\r\nequal laws.\r\n\r\nWith the wisdom of Congress it will rest to take those ulterior measures\r\nwhich may be necessary for the immediate occupation and temporary\r\ngovernment of the country; for its incorporation into our Union; for\r\nrendering the change of government a blessing to our newly adopted\r\nbrethren; for securing to them the rights of conscience and of property;\r\nfor confirming to the Indian inhabitants their occupancy and\r\nself-government, establishing friendly and commercial relations with\r\nthem, and for ascertaining the geography of the country acquired. Such\r\nmaterials, for your information, relative to its affairs in general as\r\nthe short space of time has permitted me to collect will be laid before\r\nyou when the subject shall be in a state for your consideration.\r\n\r\nAnother important acquisition of territory has also been made since the\r\nlast session of Congress. The friendly tribe of Kaskaskia Indians, with\r\nwhich we have never had a difference, reduced by the wars and wants of\r\nsavage life to a few individuals unable to defend themselves against the\r\nneighboring tribes, has transferred its country to the United States,\r\nreserving only for its members what is sufficient to maintain them in an\r\nagricultural way. The considerations stipulated are that we shall extend\r\nto them our patronage and protection and give them certain annual\r\naids in money, in implements of agriculture, and other articles of\r\ntheir choice. This country, among the most fertile within our limits,\r\nextending along the Mississippi from the mouth of the Illinois to and up\r\nthe Ohio, though not so necessary as a barrier since the acquisition of\r\nthe other bank, may yet be well worthy of being laid open to immediate\r\nsettlement, as its inhabitants may descend with rapidity in support of\r\nthe lower country should future circumstances expose that to foreign\r\nenterprise. As the stipulations in this treaty also involve matters\r\nwithin the competence of both Houses only, it will be laid before\r\nCongress as soon as the Senate shall have advised its ratification.\r\n\r\nWith many of the other Indian tribes improvements in agriculture\r\nand household manufacture are advancing, and with all our peace and\r\nfriendship are established on grounds much firmer than heretofore.\r\nThe measure adopted of establishing trading houses among them and of\r\nfurnishing them necessaries in exchange for their commodities at such\r\nmoderate prices as leave no gain, but cover us from loss, has the most\r\nconciliatory and useful effect on them, and is that which will best\r\nsecure their peace and good will.\r\n\r\nThe small vessels authorized by Congress with a view to the\r\nMediterranean service have been sent into that sea, and will be able\r\nmore effectually to confine the Tripoline cruisers within their harbors\r\nand supersede the necessity of convoy to our commerce in that quarter.\r\nThey will sensibly lessen the expenses of that service the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nA further knowledge of the ground in the northeastern and northwestern\r\nangles of the United States has evinced that the boundaries established\r\nby the treaty of Paris between the British territories and ours in those\r\nparts were too imperfectly described to be susceptible of execution.\r\nIt has therefore been thought worthy of attention for preserving and\r\ncherishing the harmony and useful intercourse subsisting between the\r\ntwo nations to remove by timely arrangements what unfavorable incidents\r\nmight otherwise render a ground of future misunderstanding. A convention\r\nhas therefore been entered into which provides for a practicable\r\ndemarcation of those limits to the satisfaction of both parties.\r\n\r\nAn account of the receipts and expenditures of the year ending the 30th\r\nof September last, with the estimates for the service of the ensuing\r\nyear, will be laid before you by the Secretary of the Treasury so soon\r\nas the receipts of the last quarter shall be returned from the more\r\ndistant States. It is already ascertained that the amount paid into the\r\nTreasury for that year has been between $11,000,000 and $12,000,000, and\r\nthat the revenue accrued during the same term exceeds the sum counted on\r\nas sufficient for our current expenses and to extinguish the public debt\r\nwithin the period heretofore proposed.\r\n\r\nThe amount of debt paid for the same year is about $3,100,000, exclusive\r\nof interest, and making, with the payment of the preceding year, a\r\ndischarge of more than $8,500,000 of the principal of that debt,\r\nbesides the accruing interest; and there remain in the Treasury nearly\r\n$6,000,000. Of these, $880,000 have been reserved for payment of the\r\nfirst installment due under the British convention of January 8, 1802,\r\nand two millions are what have been before mentioned as placed by\r\nCongress under the power and accountability of the President toward the\r\nprice of New Orleans and other territories acquired, which, remaining\r\nuntouched, are still applicable to that object and go in diminution of\r\nthe sum to be funded for it.\r\n\r\nShould the acquisition of Louisiana be constitutionally confirmed and\r\ncarried into effect, a sum of nearly $13,000,000 will then be added to\r\nour public debt, most of which is payable after fifteen years, before\r\nwhich term the present existing debts will all be discharged by the\r\nestablished operation of the sinking fund. When we contemplate the\r\nordinary annual augmentation of impost from increasing population and\r\nwealth, the augmentation of the same revenue by its extension to the new\r\nacquisition, and the economies which may still be introduced into our\r\npublic expenditures, I can not but hope that Congress in reviewing their\r\nresources will find means to meet the intermediate interest of this\r\nadditional debt without recurring to new taxes, and applying to this\r\nobject only the ordinary progression of our revenue. Its extraordinary\r\nincrease in times of foreign war will be the proper and sufficient fund\r\nfor any measures of safety or precaution which that state of things may\r\nrender necessary in our neutral position.\r\n\r\nRemittances for the installments of our foreign debt having been found\r\npracticable without loss, it has not been thought expedient to use the\r\npower given by a former act of Congress of continuing them by reloans,\r\nand of redeeming instead thereof equal sums of domestic debt, although\r\nno difficulty was found in obtaining that accommodation.\r\n\r\nThe sum of $50,000 appropriated by Congress for providing gunboats\r\nremains unexpended. The favorable and peaceable turn of affairs on the\r\nMississippi rendered an immediate execution of that law unnecessary,\r\nand time was desirable in order that the institution of that branch of\r\nour force might begin on models the most approved by experience, The\r\nsame issue of events dispensed with a resort to the appropriation of\r\n$1,500,000, contemplated for purposes which were effected by happier\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nWe have seen with sincere concern the flames of war lighted up again\r\nin Europe, and nations with which we have the most friendly and useful\r\nrelations engaged in mutual destruction. While we regret the miseries\r\nin which we see others involved, let us bow with gratitude to that\r\nkind Providence which, inspiring with wisdom and moderation our late\r\nlegislative councils while placed under the urgency of the greatest\r\nwrongs, guarded us from hastily entering into the sanguinary contest and\r\nleft us only to look on and to pity its ravages. These will be heaviest\r\non those immediately engaged. Yet the nations pursuing peace will not\r\nbe exempt from all evil. In the course of this conflict let it be our\r\nendeavor, as it is our interest and desire, to cultivate the friendship\r\nof the belligerent nations by every act of justice and of innocent\r\nkindness; to receive their armed vessels with hospitality from the\r\ndistresses of the sea, but to administer the means of annoyance to none;\r\nto establish in our harbors such a police as may maintain law and order;\r\nto restrain our citizens from embarking individually in a war in which\r\ntheir country takes no part; to punish severely those persons, citizen\r\nor alien, who shall usurp the cover of our flag for vessels not entitled\r\nto it, infecting thereby with suspicion those of real Americans and\r\ncommitting us into controversies for the redress of wrongs not our\r\nown; to exact from every nation the observance toward our vessels and\r\ncitizens of those principles and practices which all civilized people\r\nacknowledge; to merit the character of a just nation, and maintain\r\nthat of an independent one, preferring every consequence to insult and\r\nhabitual wrong. Congress will consider whether the existing laws enable\r\nus efficaciously to maintain this course with our citizens in all places\r\nand with others while within the limits of our jurisdiction, and will\r\ngive them the new modifications necessary for these objects. Some\r\ncontraventions of right have already taken place, both within our\r\njurisdictional limits and on the high seas. The friendly disposition of\r\nthe Governments from whose agents they have proceeded, as well as their\r\nwisdom and regard for justice, leave us in reasonable expectation that\r\nthey will be rectified and prevented in future, and that no act will\r\nbe countenanced by them which threatens to disturb our friendly\r\nintercourse. Separated by a wide ocean from the nations of Europe\r\nand from the political interests which entangle them together, with\r\nproductions and wants which render our commerce and friendship useful to\r\nthem and theirs to us, it can not be the interest of any to assail us,\r\nnor ours to disturb them. We should be most unwise, indeed, were we to\r\ncast away the singular blessings of the position in which nature has\r\nplaced us, the opportunity she has endowed us with of pursuing, at a\r\ndistance from foreign contentions, the paths of industry, peace, and\r\nhappiness, of cultivating general friendship, and of bringing collisions\r\nof interest to the umpirage of reason rather than of force. How\r\ndesirable, then, must it be in a Government like ours to see its\r\ncitizens adopt individually the views, the interests, and the conduct\r\nwhich their country should pursue, divesting themselves of those\r\npassions and partialities which tend to lessen useful friendships and to\r\nembarrass and embroil us in the calamitous scenes of Europe. Confident,\r\nfellow-citizens, that you will duly estimate the importance of neutral\r\ndispositions toward the observance of neutral conduct, that you will\r\nbe sensible how much it is our duty to look on the bloody arena spread\r\nbefore us with commiseration indeed, but with no other wish than to see\r\nit closed, I am persuaded you will cordially cherish these dispositions\r\nin all discussions among yourselves and in all communications with your\r\nconstituents; and I anticipate with satisfaction the measures of wisdom\r\nwhich the great interests now committed to you will give _you_ an\r\nopportunity of providing, and _myself_ that of approving and of\r\ncarrying into execution with the fidelity I owe to my country,\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 17, 1803.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn my message of this day to both Houses of Congress I explained the\r\ncircumstances which had led to the conclusion of conventions with France\r\nfor the cession of the Province of Louisiana to the United States. Those\r\nconventions are now laid before you with such communications relating to\r\nthem as may assist in deciding whether you will advise and consent to\r\ntheir ratification.\r\n\r\nThe ratification of the First Consul of France is in the hands of his\r\nchargé d'affaires here, to be exchanged for that of the United States\r\nwhensoever, before the 30th instant, it shall be in readiness.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 21, 1803.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn my communication to you of the 17th instant I informed you that\r\nconventions had been entered into with the Government of France for the\r\ncession of Louisiana to the United States. These, with the advice and\r\nconsent of the Senate, having now been ratified and my ratification\r\nexchanged for that of the First Consul of France in due form, they are\r\ncommunicated to you for consideration in your legislative capacity. You\r\nwill observe that some important conditions can not be carried into\r\nexecution but with the aid of the Legislature, and that time presses\r\na decision on them without delay.\r\n\r\nThe ulterior provisions, also suggested in the same communication,\r\nfor the occupation and government of the country will call for early\r\nattention. Such information relative to its government as time and\r\ndistance have permitted me to obtain will be ready to be laid before you\r\nwithin a few days; but as permanent arrangements for this object may\r\nrequire time and deliberation, it is for your consideration whether you\r\nwill not forthwith make such temporary provisions for the preservation\r\nin the meanwhile of order and tranquillity in the country as the case\r\nmay require.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 24, 1803.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you the convention signed on the 12th day of May last\r\nbetween the United States and Great Britain for settling their\r\nboundaries in the northeastern and northwestern parts of the United\r\nStates, which was mentioned in my general message of the 17th instant,\r\ntogether with such papers relating thereto as may enable you to\r\ndetermine whether you will advise and consent to its ratification.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 31, 1803.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States of America_:\r\n\r\nI now lay before you the treaty mentioned im my general message at the\r\nopening of the session as having been concluded with the Kaskaskia\r\nIndians for the transfer of their country to us under certain\r\nreservations and conditions.\r\n\r\nProgress having been made in the demarcation of Indian boundaries, I am\r\nnow able to communicate, to you a treaty with the Delawares, Shawanese,\r\nPotawatamies, Miamis, Eel-rivers, Weeas, Kickapoos, Piankeshaws, and\r\nKaskaskias, establishing the boundaries of the territory around St.\r\nVincennes.\r\n\r\nAlso a supplementary treaty with the Eel-rivers, Wyandots, Piankeshaws,\r\nKaskaskias, and Kickapoos, in confirmation of the fourth article of the\r\npreceding treaty.\r\n\r\nAlso a treaty with the Choctaws, describing and establishing our\r\ndemarcation of boundaries with them.\r\n\r\nWhich several treaties are accompanied by the papers relating to them,\r\nand are now submitted to the Senate for consideration whether they will\r\nadvise and consent to their ratification.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 4, 1803.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nBy the copy now communicated of a letter from Captain Bainbridge, of\r\nthe _Philadelphia_ frigate, to our consul at Gibraltar, you will learn\r\nthat an act of hostility has been committed on a merchant vessel of the\r\nUnited States by an armed ship of the Emperor of Morocco. This conduct\r\non the part of that power is without cause and without explanation. It\r\nis fortunate that Captain Bainbridge fell in with and took the capturing\r\nvessel and her prize, and I have the satisfaction to inform you that\r\nabout the date of this transaction such a force would be arriving in\r\nthe neighborhood of Gibraltar, both from the east and from the west,\r\nas leaves less to be feared for our commerce from the suddenness of\r\nthe aggression.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of September the _Constitution_ frigate, Captain Preble,\r\nwith Mr. Lear on board, was within two days' sail of Gibraltar, where\r\nthe _Philadelphia_ would then be arrived with her prize, and such\r\nexplanations would probably be instituted as the state of things\r\nrequired, and as might perhaps arrest the progress of hostilities.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile it is for Congress to consider the provisional\r\nauthorities which may be necessary to restrain the depredations of\r\nthis power should they be continued,\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 14, 1803.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now communicate a digest of the information I have received relative\r\nto Louisiana, which may be useful to the Legislature in providing for\r\nthe government of the country. A translation of the most important laws\r\nin force in that province, now in press, shall be the subject of a\r\nsupplementary communication, with such further and material information\r\nas may yet come to hand.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 24, 1803.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the desire expressed in the resolution of the House\r\nof Representatives of the 15th instant, I now lay before them copies of\r\nsuch documents as are in possession of the Executive relative to the\r\narrest and confinement of Zachariah Cox by officers in the service of\r\nthe United States in the year 1798. From the nature of the transaction\r\nsome documents relative to it might have been expected from the War\r\nOffice; but if any ever existed there they were probably lost when the\r\noffice and its papers were consumed by fire.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 25, 1803.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe treaty with the Kaskaskia Indians being ratified with the advice\r\nand consent of the Senate, it is now laid before both Houses in their\r\nlegislative capacity. It will inform them of the obligations which the\r\nUnited States thereby contract, and particularly that of taking the\r\ntribe under their future protection, and that the ceded country is\r\nsubmitted to their immediate possession and disposal.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 29, 1803.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now communicate an appendix to the information heretofore given on\r\nthe subject of Louisiana. You will be sensible, from the face of these\r\npapers, as well as of those to which they are a sequel, that they\r\nare not and could not be official, but are furnished by different\r\nindividuals as the result of the best inquiries they had been able\r\nto make, and now given as received from them, only digested under\r\nheads to prevent repetitions.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 5, 1803.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction to inform you that the act of hostility\r\nmentioned in my message of the 4th of November to have been committed by\r\na cruiser of the Emperor of Morocco on a vessel of the United States has\r\nbeen disavowed by the Emperor. All differences in consequence thereof\r\nhave been amicably adjusted, and the treaty of 1786 between this country\r\nand that has been recognized and confirmed by the Emperor, each party\r\nrestoring to the other what had been detained or taken. I inclose the\r\nEmperor's orders given on this occasion.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of our officers generally who have had a part in these\r\ntransactions has merited entire approbation.\r\n\r\nThe temperate and correct course pursued by our consul, Mr. Simpson, the\r\npromptitude and energy of Commodore Preble, the efficacious cooperation\r\nof Captains Rodgers and Campbell, of the returning squadron, the proper\r\ndecision of Captain Bainbridge that a vessel which had committed an open\r\nhostility was of right to be detained for inquiry and consideration,\r\nand the general zeal of the other officers and men are honorable facts\r\nwhich I make known with pleasure. And to these I add what was indeed\r\ntransacted in another quarter--the gallant enterprise of Captain Rodgers\r\nin destroying on the coast of Tripoli a corvette of that power of 22\r\nguns.\r\n\r\nI recommend to the consideration of Congress a just indemnification\r\nfor the interest acquired by the captors of the _Mishouda_ and\r\n_Mirboha_, yielded by them for the public accommodation.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 5, 1803,\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the desire of the Senate expressed in their\r\nresolution of the 22d of November, on the impressment of seamen in\r\nthe service of the United States by the agents of foreign nations,\r\nI now lay before the Senate a letter from the Secretary of State with\r\na specification of the cases of which information has been received.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 21, 1803.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of January last I laid before the Senate, for their\r\nconsideration and advice, a convention with Spain on the subject of\r\nindemnities for spoliations on our commerce committed by her subjects\r\nduring the late war, which convention is still before the Seriate. As\r\nthis instrument did not embrace French seizures and condemnations of\r\nour vessels in the ports of Spain, for which we deemed the latter power\r\nresponsible, our minister at that Court was instructed to press for\r\nan additional article, comprehending that branch of wrongs. I now\r\ncommunicate what has since passed on that subject. The Senate will judge\r\nwhether the prospect it offers will justify a longer suspension of\r\nthat portion of indemnities conceded by Spain should she now take no\r\nadvantage of the lapse of the period for ratification. As the settlement\r\nof the boundaries of Louisiana will call for new negotiations on our\r\nreceiving possession of that Province, the claims not obtained by the\r\nconvention now before the Senate may be incorporated into those\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 31, 1803.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now lay before Congress the annual account of the fund established\r\nfor defraying the contingent charges of Government. No occasion having\r\narisen for making use of any part of it in the present year, the balance\r\nof $18,560 unexpended at the end of the last year remains now in the\r\nTreasury.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 16, 1804.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn execution of the act of the present session of Congress for taking\r\npossession of Louisiana, as ceded to us by France, and for the temporary\r\ngovernment thereof, Governor Claiborne, of the Mississippi Territory,\r\nand General Wilkinson were appointed commissioners to receive\r\npossession. They proceeded with such regular troops as had been\r\nassembled at Fort Adams from the nearest posts and with some militia of\r\nthe Mississippi Territory to New Orleans, To be prepared for anything\r\nunexpected which might arise out of the transaction, a respectable\r\nbody of militia was ordered to be in readiness in the States of Ohio,\r\nKentucky, and Tennessee, and a part of those of Tennessee was moved\r\non to the Natchez. No occasion, however, arose for their sendees. Our\r\ncommissioners, on their arrival at New Orleans, found the Province\r\nalready delivered by the commissioners of Spain to that of France, who\r\ndelivered it over to them on the 20th day of December, as appears by\r\ntheir declaratory act accompanying this. Governor Claiborne, being\r\nduly invested with the powers heretofore exercised by the governor and\r\nintendant of Louisiana, assumed the government on the same day, and for\r\nthe maintenance of law and order immediately issued the proclamation and\r\naddress now communicated.\r\n\r\nOn this important acquisition, so favorable to the immediate interests\r\nof our Western citizens, so auspicious to the peace and security of the\r\nnation in general, which adds to our country territories so extensive\r\nand fertile and to our citizens new brethren to partake of the blessings\r\nof freedom and self-government, I offer to Congress and our country my\r\nsincere congratulations,\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 24, 1804.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI communicate for your information a letter just received from Governor\r\nClaiborne, which may throw light on the subject of the government of\r\nLouisiana, under contemplation of the Legislature. The paper being\r\noriginal, a return is asked.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 16, 1804.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nInformation having been received some time ago that the public lands in\r\nthe neighborhood of Detroit required particular attention, the agent\r\nappointed to transact business with the Indians in that quarter was\r\ninstructed to inquire into and report the situation of the titles\r\nand occupation of the lands, private and public, in the neighboring\r\nsettlements. His report is now communicated, that the Legislature may\r\njudge how far its interposition is necessary to quiet the legal titles,\r\nconfirm the equitable, to remove the past and prevent future intrusions\r\nwhich have neither law nor justice for the basis.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 22, 1804.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress, for their information, a report of the\r\nsurveyor of the public buildings at Washington, stating what has been\r\ndone under the act of the last session concerning the city of Washington\r\non the Capitol and other public buildings, and the highway between them.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 29, 1804.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate, for the information of Congress, a letter stating certain\r\nfraudulent practices for monopolizing lands in Louisiana, which may\r\nperhaps require legislative provisions.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 20, 1804.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress a letter received from Captain Bainbridge,\r\ncommander of the _Philadelphia_ frigate, informing us of the wreck\r\nof that vessel on the coast of Tripoli, and that himself, his officers\r\nand men, had fallen into the hands of the Tripolitans. This accident\r\nrenders it expedient to increase our force and enlarge our expenses\r\nin the Mediterranean beyond what the last appropriation for the naval\r\nservice contemplated. I recommend, therefore, to the consideration of\r\nCongress such an addition to that appropriation as they may think the\r\nexigency requires.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 22, 1804.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress the last returns of the militia of the United\r\nStates. Their incompleteness is much to be regretted, and its remedy\r\nmay at some future time be a subject worthy the attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Annals of Congress, Eighth Congress, second session, 1234.]\r\n\r\n_To all whom these presents shall come_:\r\n\r\nWhereas by an act of Congress authority has been given to the President\r\nof the United States, whenever he shall deem it expedient, to erect the\r\nshores, waters, and inlets of the bay and river of Mobile, and of the\r\nother rivers, creeks, inlets, and bays emptying into the Gulf of Mexico\r\neast of the said river Mobile and west thereof to the Pascagoula,\r\ninclusive, into a separate district for the collection of duties on\r\nimports and tonnage; and to establish such place within the same as he\r\nshall deem it expedient to be the port of entry and delivery for such\r\ndistrict; and to designate such other places within the same district,\r\nnot exceeding two, to be ports of delivery only:\r\n\r\nNow know ye that I, Thomas Jefferson, President of the United States,\r\ndo hereby decide that all the above-mentioned shores, waters, inlets,\r\ncreeks, and rivers lying within the boundaries of the United States\r\nshall constitute and form a separate district, to be denominated \"the\r\ndistrict of Mobile;\" and do also designate Fort Stoddert, within the\r\ndistrict aforesaid, to be the port of entry and delivery for the said\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand this 20th day of May, 1804.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 8, 1804.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nTo a people, fellow-citizens, who sincerely desire the happiness and\r\nprosperity of other nations; to those who justly calculate that their\r\nown well-being is advanced by that of the nations with which they have\r\nintercourse, it will be a satisfaction to observe that the war which\r\nwas lighted up in Europe a little before our last meeting has not yet\r\nextended its flames to other nations, nor been marked by the calamities\r\nwhich sometimes stain the footsteps of war. The irregularities, too, on\r\nthe ocean, which generally harass the commerce of neutral nations, have,\r\nin distant parts, disturbed ours less than on former occasions; but in\r\nthe American seas they have been greater from peculiar causes, and even\r\nwithin our harbors and jurisdiction infringements on the authority of\r\nthe laws have been committed which have called for serious attention.\r\nThe friendly conduct of the Governments from whose officers and subjects\r\nthese acts have proceeded, in other respects and in places more under\r\ntheir observation and control, gives us confidence that our\r\nrepresentations on this subject will have been properly regarded.\r\n\r\nWhile noticing the irregularities committed on the ocean by others,\r\nthose on our own part should not be omitted nor left unprovided for.\r\nComplaints have been received that persons residing within the United\r\nStates have taken on themselves to arm merchant vessels and to force a\r\ncommerce into certain ports and countries in defiance of the laws of\r\nthose countries. That individuals should undertake to wage private war,\r\nindependently of the authority of their country, can not be permitted in\r\na well-ordered society. Its tendency to produce aggression on the laws\r\nand rights of other nations and to endanger the peace of our own is so\r\nobvious that I doubt not you will adopt measures for restraining it\r\neffectually in future.\r\n\r\nSoon after the passage of the act of the last session authorizing the\r\nestablishment of a district and port of entry on the waters of the\r\nMobile we learnt that its object was misunderstood on the part of\r\nSpain. Candid explanations were immediately given and assurances\r\nthat, reserving our claims in that quarter as a subject of discussion\r\nand arrangement with Spain, no act was meditated in the meantime\r\ninconsistent with the peace and friendship existing between the two\r\nnations, and that conformably to these intentions would be the execution\r\nof the law. That Government had, however, thought proper to suspend the\r\nratification of the convention of 1802; but the explanations which would\r\nreach them soon after, and still more the confirmation of them by\r\nthe tenor of the instrument establishing the port and district, may\r\nreasonably be expected to replace them in the dispositions and views\r\nof the whole subject which originally dictated the convention.\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction to inform you that the objections which had\r\nbeen urged by that Government against the validity of our title to the\r\ncountry of Louisiana have been withdrawn, its exact limits, however,\r\nremaining still to be settled between us; and to this is to be added\r\nthat, having prepared and delivered the stock created in execution of\r\nthe convention of Paris of April 30, 1803, in consideration of the\r\ncession of that country, we have received from the Government of France\r\nan acknowledgment, in due form, of the fulfillment of that stipulation.\r\n\r\nWith the nations of Europe in general our friendship and intercourse\r\nare undisturbed, and from the Governments of the belligerent powers\r\nespecially we continue to receive those friendly manifestations which\r\nare justly due to an honest neutrality and to such good offices\r\nconsistent with that as we have opportunities of rendering.\r\n\r\nThe activity and success of the small force employed in the\r\nMediterranean in the early part of the present year, the reenforcements\r\nsent into that sea, and the energy of the officers having command in\r\nthe several vessels will, I trust, by the sufferings of war, reduce the\r\nbarbarians of Tripoli to the desire of peace on proper terms. Great\r\ninjury, however, ensues to ourselves, as well as to others interested,\r\nfrom the distance to which prizes must be brought for adjudication and\r\nfrom the impracticability of bringing hither such as are not seaworthy.\r\n\r\nThe Bey of Tunis having made requisitions unauthorized by our treaty,\r\ntheir rejection has produced from him some expressions of discontent.\r\nBut to those who expect us to calculate whether a compliance with unjust\r\ndemands will not cost us less than a war we must leave as a question of\r\ncalculation for them also whether to retire from unjust demands will\r\nnot cost them less than a war. We can do to each other very sensible\r\ninjuries by war, but the mutual advantages of peace make that the best\r\ninterest of both.\r\n\r\nPeace and intercourse with the other powers on the same coast continue\r\non the footing on which they are established by treaty.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the act providing for the temporary government of\r\nLouisiana, the necessary officers for the Territory of Orleans were\r\nappointed in due time to commence the exercise of their functions on\r\nthe 1st day of October. The distance, however, of some of them and\r\nindispensable previous arrangements may have retarded its commencement\r\nin some of its parts. The form of government thus provided having been\r\nconsidered but as temporary, and open to such future improvements as\r\nfurther information of the circumstances of our brethren there might\r\nsuggest, it will of course be subject to your consideration.\r\n\r\nIn the district of Louisiana it has been thought best to adopt the\r\ndivision into subordinate districts which had been established under its\r\nformer government. These being five in number, a commanding officer has\r\nbeen appointed to each, according to the provisions of the law, and so\r\nsoon as they can be at their stations that district will also be in its\r\ndue state of organization. In the meantime their places are supplied by\r\nthe officers before commanding there. And the functions of the governor\r\nand judges of Indiana having commenced, the government, we presume, is\r\nproceeding in its new form. The lead mines in that district offer so\r\nrich a supply of that metal as to merit attention. The report now\r\ncommunicated will inform you of their state and of the necessity of\r\nimmediate inquiry into their occupation and titles.\r\n\r\nWith the Indian tribes established within our newly acquired limits,\r\nI have deemed it necessary to open conferences for the purpose of\r\nestablishing a good understanding and neighborly relations between us.\r\nSo far as we have yet learned, we have reason to believe that their\r\ndispositions are generally favorable and friendly; and with these\r\ndispositions on their part, we have in our own hands means which can\r\nnot fail us for preserving their peace and friendship. By pursuing\r\nan uniform course of justice toward them, by aiding them in all the\r\nimprovements which may better their condition, and especially by\r\nestablishing a commerce on terms which shall be advantageous to them and\r\nonly not losing to us, and so regulated as that no incendiaries of our\r\nown or any other nation may be permitted to disturb the natural effects\r\nof our just and friendly offices, we may render ourselves so necessary\r\nto their comfort and prosperity that the protection of our citizens\r\nfrom their disorderly members will become their interest and their\r\nvoluntary care. Instead, therefore, of an augmentation of military\r\nforce proportioned to our extension of frontier, I propose a moderate\r\nenlargement of the capital employed in that commerce as a more\r\neffectual, economical, and humane instrument for preserving peace and\r\ngood neighborhood with them.\r\n\r\nOn this side the Mississippi an important relinquishment of native title\r\nhas been received from the Delawares. That tribe, desiring to extinguish\r\nin their people the spirit of hunting and to convert superfluous lands\r\ninto the means of improving what they retain, has ceded to us all the\r\ncountry between the Wabash and Ohio south of and including the road from\r\nthe rapids toward Vincennes, for which they are to receive annuities in\r\nanimals and implements for agriculture and in other necessaries. This\r\nacquisition is important, not only for its extent and fertility, but as\r\nfronting 300 miles on the Ohio, and near half that on the Wabash. The\r\nproduce of the settled country descending those rivers will no longer\r\npass in review of the Indian frontier but in a small portion, and, with\r\nthe cession heretofore made by the Kaskaskias, nearly consolidates our\r\npossessions north of the Ohio, in a very respectable breadth--from\r\nLake Erie to the Mississippi. The Piankeshaws having some claim to the\r\ncountry ceded by the Delawares, it has been thought best to quiet that\r\nby fair purchase also. So soon as the treaties on this subject shall\r\nhave received their constitutional sanctions they shall be laid before\r\nboth Houses.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress of February 28, 1803, for building and employing\r\na number of gunboats, is now in a course of execution to the extent\r\nthere provided for. The obstacle to naval enterprise which vessels of\r\nthis construction offer for our seaport towns, their utility toward\r\nsupporting within our waters the authority of the laws, the promptness\r\nwith which they will be manned by the seamen and militia of the place\r\nin the moment they are wanting, the facility of their assembling from\r\ndifferent parts of the coast to any point where they are required in\r\ngreater force than ordinary, the economy of their maintenance and\r\npreservation from decay when not in actual service, and the competence\r\nof our finances to this defensive provision without any new burthen are\r\nconsiderations which will have due weight with Congress in deciding\r\non the expediency of adding to their number from year to year, as\r\nexperience shall test their utility, until all our important harbors,\r\nby these and auxiliary means, shall be secured against insult and\r\nopposition to the laws.\r\n\r\nNo circumstance has arisen since your last session which calls for any\r\naugmentation of our regular military force. Should any improvement occur\r\nin the militia system, that will be always seasonable.\r\n\r\nAccounts of the receipts and expenditures of the last year, with\r\nestimates for the ensuing one, will as usual be laid before you.\r\n\r\nThe state of our finances continues to fulfill our expectations. Eleven\r\nmillions and a half of dollars, received in the course of the year\r\nending the 30th of September last, have enabled us, after meeting all\r\nthe ordinary expenses of the year, to pay upward of $3,600,000 of the\r\npublic debt, exclusive of interest. This payment, with those of the\r\ntwo preceding years, has extinguished upward of twelve millions of the\r\nprincipal and a greater sum of interest within that period, and by a\r\nproportionate diminution of interest renders already sensible the effect\r\nof the growing sum yearly applicable to the discharge of the principal.\r\n\r\nIt is also ascertained that the revenue accrued during the last year\r\nexceeds that of the preceding, and the probable receipts of the ensuing\r\nyear may safely be relied on as sufficient, with the sum already in the\r\nTreasury, to meet all the current demands of the year, to discharge\r\nupward of three millions and a half of the engagements incurred under\r\nthe British and French conventions, and to advance in the further\r\nredemption of the funded debt as rapidly as had been contemplated.\r\nThese, fellow-citizens, are the principal matters which I have thought\r\nit necessary at this time to communicate for your consideration and\r\nattention. Some others will be laid before you in the course of the\r\nsession; but in the discharge of the great duties confided to you by\r\nour country you will take a broader view of the field of legislation.\r\nWhether the great interests of agriculture, manufactures, commerce, or\r\nnavigation can within the pale of your constitutional powers be aided\r\nin any of their relations; whether laws are provided in all cases where\r\nthey are wanting; whether those provided are exactly what they should\r\nbe; whether any abuses take place in their administration, or in that of\r\nthe public revenues; whether the organization of the public agents or of\r\nthe public force is perfect in all its parts; in fine, whether anything\r\ncan be done to advance the general good, are questions within the limits\r\nof your functions which will necessarily occupy your attention. In these\r\nand all other matters which you in your wisdom may propose for the good\r\nof our country you may count with assurance on my hearty cooperation and\r\nfaithful execution.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovember 15, 1804.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now lay before you a treaty, entered into on the 18th day of August of\r\nthe present year, between the United States on one part and the Delaware\r\nIndians on the other, for the extinguishment of their title to a tract\r\nof country between the Ohio and Wabash rivers.\r\n\r\nAnd another of the 27th day of the same month, between the United States\r\nand the Piankeshaws, for a confirmation of the same by the latter,\r\ntogether with a letter from Governor Harrison on the same subject; which\r\ntreaties are submitted for your advice and consent.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 15, 1804.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAgreeably to your resolution of the 9th instant, I now lay before you a\r\nstatement of the circumstances attending the destruction of the frigate\r\n_Philadelphia_, with the names of the officers and the number of men\r\nemployed on the occasion, to which I have to add that Lieutenant Decatur\r\nwas thereupon advanced to be a captain in the Navy of the United States.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 30, 1804.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now lay before you copies of the treaties concluded with the Delaware\r\nand Piankeshaw Indians for the extinguishment of their title to the\r\nlands therein described, and I recommend to the consideration of\r\nCongress the making provision by law for carrying them into execution.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 13. 1804.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI present for your advice a treaty entered into on behalf of the United\r\nStates with the Creek Indians for the extinguishment of their right in\r\ncertain lands in the forks of Oconee and Okmulgee rivers, within the\r\nState of Georgia. For the purpose of enabling you to form a satisfactory\r\njudgment on the subject, it is accompanied with the instructions of\r\n1802, April 12, to James Wilkinson, Benjamin Hawkins, and Andrew\r\nPickens, commissioners; those of 1803, May 5, to James Wilkinson,\r\nBenjamin Hawkins, and Robert Anderson, commissioners, and those of 1804,\r\nApril 2, to Benjamin Hawkins, sole commissioner. The negotiations for\r\nobtaining the whole of the lands between the Oconee and Okmulgee have\r\nnow been continued through three successive seasons under the original\r\ninstructions and others supplementary to them given from time to time,\r\nas circumstances required, and the unity of the negotiation has been\r\npreserved not only by the subject, but by continuing Colonel Hawkins\r\nalways one of the commissioners, and latterly the sole one. The extent\r\nof the cession to be obtained being uncertain, the limitation of price\r\nwas what should be thought _reasonable according to the usual rate of\r\ncompensation_. The commissioner has been induced to go beyond this\r\nlimit probably by the just attentions due to the strong interest which\r\nthe State of Georgia feels in making this particular acquisition, and by\r\na despair of procuring it on more reasonable terms from a tribe which\r\nis one of those most fixed in the policy of holding fast their lands.\r\nTo this may be added that if, by an alteration in the first article,\r\ninstead of giving them stock which may be passed into other hands and\r\nrender them the prey of speculators, an annuity shall be paid them in\r\nthis case, as has hitherto been practiced in all similar cases, the\r\nprice of these lands will become a pledge and guaranty for our future\r\npeace with this important tribe, and eventually an indemnity for the\r\nbreach of it.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I rest with entire satisfaction on the wisdom and counsel\r\nof those whose sanctions the Constitution has rendered necessary to the\r\nfinal validity of this act.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 31, 1804.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe inclosed letter, written from Malta by Richard O'Brien, our late\r\nconsul at Algiers, giving some details of transactions before Tripoli,\r\nis communicated for the information of Congress.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 31, 1804.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nMost of the Indians residing within our northern boundary on this\r\nside of the Mississippi receiving from us annual aids in money and\r\nnecessaries, it was a subject of complaint with the Sacs that they\r\nreceived nothing and were connected with us by no treaty. As they owned\r\nthe country in the neighborhood of our settlements of Kaskaskia and St.\r\nLouis, it was thought expedient to engage their friendship, and Governor\r\nHarrison was accordingly instructed in June last to propose to them an\r\nannuity of $500 or $600, stipulating in return an adequate cession of\r\nterritory and an exact definition of boundaries. The Sacs and Foxes\r\nacting generally as one nation, and coming forward together, he found\r\nit necessary to add an annuity for the latter tribe also, enlarging\r\nproportionably the cession of territory, which was accordingly done by\r\nthe treaty now communicated, of November the 3d, with those two tribes.\r\n\r\nThis cession, giving us a perfect title to such a breadth of country on\r\nthe eastern side of the Mississippi, with a command of the Ouisconsin,\r\nstrengthens our means of retaining exclusive commerce with the Indians\r\non the western side of the Mississippi--a right indispensable to the\r\npolicy of governing those Indians by commerce rather than by arms.\r\n\r\nThe treaty is now submitted to the Senate for their advice and consent.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 31, 1805.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the desire of the House of Representatives, expressed\r\nin their resolution of yesterday, I have to inform them that by a letter\r\nof the 30th of May last from the Secretary of War to Samuel Hammond, a\r\nmember of the House, it was proposed to him to accept a commission of\r\ncolonel-commandant for the district of Louisiana when the new government\r\nthere should commence. By a letter of the 30th of June he signified a\r\nwillingness to accept, but still more definitively by one of October 26,\r\na copy of which is therefore now communicated. A commission had been\r\nmade out for him bearing date the ist day of October last, and forwarded\r\nbefore the receipt of his letter of October 26. No later communication\r\nhas been received from him, nor is anything later known of his\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 1, 1805.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nFor some weeks past I have had reason to expect by every mail from New\r\nOrleans information which would have fully met the views of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, expressed in their resolution of December 31, on the\r\nsubject of a post-road from the city of Washington to New Orleans; but\r\nthis being not yet received, I think it my duty without further delay to\r\ncommunicate to the House the information I possess, however imperfect.\r\n\r\nIsaac Briggs, one of the surveyors-general of the United States, being\r\nabout to return in July last to his station at Natchez, and apprised of\r\nthe anxiety existing to have a practicable road explored for forwarding\r\nthe mail to New Orleans without crossing the mountains, offered his\r\nservices voluntarily to return by the route contemplated, taking as\r\nhe should go such observations of longitude and latitude as would\r\nenable him to delineate it exactly, and by protraction to show of what\r\nshortenings it would admit, The offer was accepted and he was furnished\r\nwith an accurate sextant for his observations. The route proposed was\r\nfrom Washington by Fredericksburg, Cartersville, Lower Sauratown,\r\nSalisbury, Franklin Court-House in Georgia, Tuckabachee, Fort Stoddert,\r\nand the mouth of Pearl River to New Orleans. It is believed he followed\r\nthis route generally, deviating at times only for special purposes, and\r\nreturning again into it. His letters, herewith communicated, will\r\nshew his opinion to have been, after completing his journey, that the\r\npracticable distance between Washington and New Orleans will be a little\r\nover 1,000 miles. He expected to forward his map and special report\r\nwithin one week from the date of his last letter, but a letter of\r\nDecember 10, from another person, informs me he had been unwell, but\r\nwould forward them within a week from that time. So soon as they shall\r\nbe received they shall be communicated to the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 5, 1805.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State has lately received a note from the Danish chargé\r\nd'affaires, claiming, _in the name of his Government_, restitution\r\nin the case of the brig _Henrich_, communicated to Congress at a\r\nformer session, in which note were transmitted sundry documents chiefly\r\nrelating to the value and neutral character of the vessel, and to the\r\nquestion whether the judicial proceedings were instituted and conducted\r\nwithout the concurrence of the captain of the _Henrich_. As these\r\ndocuments appear to form a necessary appendage to those already before\r\nCongress, and throw additional light on the subject, I transmit copies\r\nof them herewith.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 13, 1805.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn the message to Congress at the opening of the present session I\r\ninformed them that treaties had been entered into with the Delaware and\r\nPiankeshaw Indians for the purchase of their right to certain lands on\r\nthe Ohio. I have since received another, entered into with the Sacs and\r\nFoxes, for a portion of country on both sides of the river Mississippi.\r\nThese treaties, having been advised and consented to by the Senate, have\r\naccordingly been ratified, but as they involve conditions which require\r\nlegislative provision, they are now submitted to both branches for\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 20, 1805.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate, for the information of Congress, a letter of September 18\r\nfrom Commodore Preble, giving a detailed account of the transactions of\r\nthe vessels under his command from July the 9th to the 10th of September\r\nlast past.\r\n\r\nThe energy and judgment displayed by this excellent officer through the\r\nwhole course of the service lately confided to him and the zeal and\r\nvalor of his officers and men in the several enterprises executed by\r\nthem can not fail to give high satisfaction to Congress and their\r\ncountry, of whom they have deserved well.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 28, 1805.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now lay before Congress a statement of the militia of the United\r\nStates, according to the returns last received from the several States.\r\nIt will be perceived that some of these are not of recent dates, and\r\nthat from the States of Maryland, Delaware, and Tennessee no returns are\r\nstated. As far as appears from our records, none were ever rendered from\r\neither of these States.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 28, 1805.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now render to Congress the account of the fund established by the act\r\nof May 1, 1802, for defraying the contingent charges of Government. No\r\noccasion having arisen for making use of any part of the balance of\r\n$18,560 unexpended on the 31st day of December, 1803, when the last\r\naccount was rendered by message, that balance has been carried to the\r\ncredit of the surplus fund.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nProceeding, fellow-citizens, to that qualification which the\r\nConstitution requires before my entrance on the charge again conferred\r\non me, it is my duty to express the deep sense I entertain of this new\r\nproof of confidence from my fellow-citizens at large, and the zeal with\r\nwhich it inspires me so to conduct myself as may best satisfy their just\r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\nOn taking this station on a former occasion I declared the principles\r\non which I believed it my duty to administer the affairs of our\r\nCommonwealth. My conscience tells me I have on every occasion acted\r\nup to that declaration according to its obvious import and to the\r\nunderstanding of every candid mind.\r\n\r\nIn the transaction of your foreign affairs we have endeavored to\r\ncultivate the friendship of all nations, and especially of those with\r\nwhich we have the most important relations. We have clone them justice\r\non all occasions, favored where favor was lawful, and cherished mutual\r\ninterests and intercourse on fair and equal terms. We are firmly\r\nconvinced, and we act on that conviction, that with nations as with\r\nindividuals our interests soundly calculated will ever be found\r\ninseparable from our moral duties, and history bears witness to the\r\nfact that a just nation is trusted on its word when recourse is had\r\nto armaments and wars to bridle others.\r\n\r\nAt home, fellow-citizens, you best know whether we have done well or\r\nill. The suppression of unnecessary offices, of useless establishments\r\nand expenses, enabled us to discontinue our internal taxes. These,\r\ncovering our land with officers and opening our doors to their\r\nintrusions, had already begun that process of domiciliary vexation which\r\nonce entered is scarcely to be restrained from reaching successively\r\nevery article of property and produce. If among these taxes some minor\r\nones fell which had not been inconvenient, it was because their amount\r\nwould not have paid the officers who collected them, and because, if\r\nthey had any merit, the State authorities might adopt them instead of\r\nothers less approved.\r\n\r\nThe remaining revenue on the consumption of foreign articles is paid\r\nchiefly by those who can afford to add foreign luxuries to domestic\r\ncomforts, being collected on our seaboard and frontiers only, and,\r\nincorporated with the transactions of our mercantile citizens, it may be\r\nthe pleasure and the pride of an American to ask, What farmer, what\r\nmechanic, what laborer ever sees a taxgatherer of the United States?\r\nThese contributions enable us to support the current expenses of the\r\nGovernment, to fulfill contracts with foreign nations, to extinguish the\r\nnative right of soil within our limits, to extend those limits, and to\r\napply such a surplus to our public debts as places at a short day their\r\nfinal redemption, and that redemption once effected the revenue thereby\r\nliberated may, by a just repartition of it among the States and a\r\ncorresponding amendment of the Constitution, be applied _in time\r\nof peace_ to rivers, canals, roads, arts, manufactures, education,\r\nand other great objects within each State. _In time of war_, if\r\ninjustice by ourselves or others must sometimes produce war, increased\r\nas the same revenue will be by increased population and consumption, and\r\naided by other resources reserved for that crisis, it may meet within\r\nthe year all the expenses of the year without encroaching on the rights\r\nof future generations by burthening them with the debts of the past. War\r\nwill then be but a suspension of useful works, and a return to a state\r\nof peace a return to the progress of improvement.\r\n\r\nI have said, fellow-citizens, that the income reserved had enabled us to\r\nextend our limits, but that extension may possibly pay for itself before\r\nwe are called on, and in the meantime may keep down the accruing\r\ninterest; in all events, it will replace the advances we shall have\r\nmade. I know that the acquisition of Louisiana has been disapproved by\r\nsome from a candid apprehension that the enlargement of our territory\r\nwould endanger its union. But who can limit the extent to which the\r\nfederative principle may operate effectively? The larger our association\r\nthe less will it be shaken by local passions; and in any view is it not\r\nbetter that the opposite bank of the Mississippi should be settled by\r\nour own brethren and children than by strangers of another family? With\r\nwhich should we be most likely to live in harmony and friendly\r\nintercourse?\r\n\r\nIn matters of religion I have considered that its free exercise is\r\nplaced by the Constitution independent of the powers of the General\r\nGovernment. I have therefore undertaken on no occasion to prescribe\r\nthe religious exercises suited to it, but have left them, as the\r\nConstitution found them, under the direction and discipline of the\r\nchurch or state authorities acknowledged by the several religious\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\nThe aboriginal inhabitants of these countries I have regarded with the\r\ncommiseration their history inspires. Endowed with the faculties and the\r\nrights of men, breathing an ardent love of liberty and independence, and\r\noccupying a country which left them no desire but to be undisturbed, the\r\nstream of overflowing population from other regions directed itself on\r\nthese shores; without power to divert or habits to contend against\r\nit, they have been overwhelmed by the current or driven before it;\r\nnow reduced within limits too narrow for the hunter's state, humanity\r\nenjoins us to teach them agriculture and the domestic arts; to encourage\r\nthem to that industry which alone can enable them to maintain their\r\nplace in existence and to prepare them in time for that state of society\r\nwhich to bodily comforts adds the improvement of the mind and morals. We\r\nhave therefore liberally furnished them with the implements of husbandry\r\nand household use; we have placed among them instructors in the arts of\r\nfirst necessity, and they are covered with the aegis of the law against\r\naggressors from among ourselves.\r\n\r\nBut the endeavors to enlighten them on the fate which awaits their\r\npresent course of life, to induce them to exercise their reason, follow\r\nits dictates, and change their pursuits with the change of circumstances\r\nhave powerful obstacles to encounter; they are combated by the habits\r\nof their bodies, prejudices of their minds, ignorance, pride, and the\r\ninfluence of interested and crafty individuals among them who feel\r\nthemselves something in the present order of things and fear to become\r\nnothing in any other. These persons inculcate a sanctimonious reverence\r\nfor the customs of their ancestors; that whatsoever they did must be\r\ndone through all time; that reason is a false guide, and to advance\r\nunder its counsel in their physical, moral, or political condition is\r\nperilous innovation; that their duty is to remain as their Creator made\r\nthem, ignorance being safety and knowledge full of danger; in short,\r\nmy friends, among them also is seen the action and counteraction of\r\ngood sense and of bigotry; they too have their antiphilosophists who\r\nfind an interest in keeping things in their present state, who dread\r\nreformation, and exert all their faculties to maintain the ascendency of\r\nhabit over the duty of improving our reason and obeying its mandates.\r\n\r\nIn giving these outlines I do not mean, fellow-citizens, to arrogate to\r\nmyself the merit of the measures. That is due, in the first place, to\r\nthe reflecting character of our citizens at large, who, by the weight of\r\npublic opinion, influence and strengthen the public measures. It is due\r\nto the sound discretion with which they select from among themselves\r\nthose to whom they confide the legislative duties. It is due to the zeal\r\nand wisdom of the characters thus selected, who lay the foundations of\r\npublic happiness in wholesome laws, the execution of which alone remains\r\nfor others, and it is due to the able and faithful auxiliaries, whose\r\npatriotism has associated them with me in the executive functions.\r\n\r\nDuring this course of administration, and in order to disturb it,\r\nthe artillery of the press has been leveled against us, charged with\r\nwhatsoever its licentiousness could devise or dare. These abuses of\r\nan institution so important to freedom and science are deeply to be\r\nregretted, inasmuch as they tend to lessen its usefulness and to sap\r\nits safety. They might, indeed, have been corrected by the wholesome\r\npunishments reserved to and provided by the laws of the several States\r\nagainst falsehood and defamation, but public duties more urgent press on\r\nthe time of public servants, and the offenders have therefore been left\r\nto find their punishment in the public indignation.\r\n\r\nNor was it uninteresting to the world that an experiment should be\r\nfairly and fully made, whether freedom of discussion, unaided by power,\r\nis not sufficient for the propagation and protection of truth--whether\r\na government conducting itself in the true spirit of its constitution,\r\nwith zeal and purity, and doing no act which it would be unwilling\r\nthe whole world should witness, can be written down by falsehood and\r\ndefamation. The experiment has been tried: you have witnessed the scene;\r\nour fellow-citizens looked on, cool and collected; they saw the latent\r\nsource from which these outrages proceeded; they gathered around their\r\npublic functionaries, and when the Constitution called them to the\r\ndecision by suffrage, they pronounced their verdict, honorable to those\r\nwho had served them and consolatory to the friend of man who believes\r\nthat he may be trusted with the control of his own affairs.\r\n\r\nNo inference is here intended that the laws provided by the States\r\nagainst false and defamatory publications should not be enforced; he\r\nwho has time renders a service to public morals and public tranquillity\r\nin reforming these abuses by the salutary coercions of the law; but\r\nthe experiment is noted to prove that, since truth and reason have\r\nmaintained their ground against false opinions in league with false\r\nfacts, the press, confined to truth, needs no other legal restraint;\r\nthe public judgment will correct false reasonings and opinions on a\r\nfull hearing of all parties; and no other definite line can be drawn\r\nbetween the inestimable liberty of the press and its demoralizing\r\nlicentiousness. If there be still improprieties which this rule would\r\nnot restrain, its supplement must be sought in the censorship of public\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nContemplating the union of sentiment now manifested so generally as\r\nauguring harmony and happiness to our future course, I offer to our\r\ncountry sincere congratulations. With those, too, not yet rallied to\r\nthe same point the disposition to do so is gaining strength; facts are\r\npiercing through the veil drawn over them, and our doubting brethren\r\nwill at length see that the mass of their fellow-citizens with whom they\r\ncan not yet resolve to act as to principles and measures, think as they\r\nthink and desire what they desire; that our wish as well as theirs is\r\nthat the public efforts may be directed honestly to the public good,\r\nthat peace be cultivated, civil and religious liberty unassailed, law\r\nand order preserved, equality of rights maintained, and that state of\r\nproperty, equal or unequal, which results to every man from his own\r\nindustry or that of his father's. When satisfied of these views it is\r\nnot in human nature that they should not approve and support them. In\r\nthe meantime let us cherish them with patient affection, let us do them\r\njustice, and more than justice, in all competitions of interest, and we\r\nneed not doubt that truth, reason, and their own interests will at\r\nlength prevail, will gather them into the fold of their country, and\r\nwill complete that entire union of opinion which gives to a nation the\r\nblessing of harmony and the benefit of all its strength.\r\n\r\nI shall now enter on the duties to which my fellow-citizens have again\r\ncalled me, and shall proceed in the spirit of those principles which\r\nthey have approved. I fear not that any motives of interest may lead me\r\nastray; I am sensible of no passion which could seduce me knowingly from\r\nthe path of justice, but the weaknesses of human nature and the limits\r\nof my own understanding will produce errors of judgment sometimes\r\ninjurious to your interests. I shall need, therefore, all the indulgence\r\nwhich I have heretofore experienced from my constituents; the want of\r\nit will certainly not lessen with increasing years. I shall need, too,\r\nthe favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who led our fathers, as\r\nIsrael of old, from their native land and planted them in a country\r\nflowing with all the necessaries and comforts of life; who has covered\r\nour infancy with His providence and our riper years with His wisdom and\r\npower, and to whose goodness I ask you to join in supplications with\r\nme that He will so enlighten the minds of your servants, guide their\r\ncouncils, and prosper their measures that whatsoever they do shall\r\nresult in your good, and shall secure to you the peace, friendship,\r\nand approbation of all nations.\r\n\r\nMARCH 4, 1805.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 3, 1805.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_.\r\n\r\nAt a moment when the nations of Europe are in commotion and arming\r\nagainst each other, and when those with whom we have principal\r\nintercourse are engaged in the general contest, and when the countenance\r\nof some of them toward our peaceable country threatens that even that\r\nmay not be unaffected by what is passing on the general theater, a\r\nmeeting of the representatives of the nation in both Houses of Congress\r\nhas become more than usually desirable. Coming from every section of our\r\ncountry, they bring with them the sentiments and the information of the\r\nwhole, and will be enabled to give a direction to the public affairs\r\nwhich the will and the wisdom of the whole will approve and support.\r\n\r\nIn taking a view of the state of our country we in the first place\r\nnotice the late affliction of two of our cities under the fatal fever\r\nwhich in latter times has occasionally visited our shores. Providence in\r\nHis goodness gave it an early termination on this occasion and lessened\r\nthe number of victims which have usually fallen before it. In the course\r\nof the several visitations by this disease it has appeared that it\r\nis strictly local, incident to cities and on the tide waters only,\r\nincommunicable in the country either by persons under the disease or by\r\ngoods carried from diseased places; that its access is with the autumn\r\nand it disappears with the early frosts. These restrictions within\r\nnarrow limits of time and space give security even to our maritime\r\ncities during three-fourths of the year, and to the country always.\r\nAlthough from these facts it appears unnecessary, yet to satisfy the\r\nfears of foreign nations and cautions on their part not to be complained\r\nof in a danger whose limits are yet unknown to them I have strictly\r\nenjoined on the officers at the head of the customs to certify with\r\nexact truth for every vessel sailing for a foreign port the state of\r\nhealth respecting this fever which prevails at the place from which she\r\nsails. Under every motive from character and duty to certify the truth,\r\nI have no doubt they have faithfully executed this injunction. Much real\r\ninjury has, however, been sustained from a propensity to identify with\r\nthis endemic and to call by the same name fevers of very different\r\nkinds, which have been known at all times and in all countries, and\r\nnever have been placed among those deemed contagious. As we advance in\r\nour knowledge of this disease, as facts develop the source from which\r\nindividuals receive it, the State authorities charged with the care of\r\nthe public health, and Congress with that of the general commerce, will\r\nbecome able to regulate with effect their respective functions in these\r\ndepartments. The burthen of quarantines is felt at home as well as\r\nabroad; their efficacy merits examination. Although the health laws of\r\nthe States should be found to need no present revisal by Congress, yet\r\ncommerce claims that their attention be ever awake to them.\r\n\r\nSince our last meeting the aspect of our foreign relations has\r\nconsiderably changed. Our coasts have been infested and our harbors\r\nwatched by private armed vessels, some of them without commissions,\r\nsome with illegal commissions, others with those of legal form, but\r\ncommitting piratical acts beyond the authority of their commissions.\r\nThey have captured in the very entrance of our harbors, as well as\r\non the high seas, not only the vessels of our friends coming to trade\r\nwith us, but our own also. They have carried them off under pretense of\r\nlegal adjudication, but not daring to approach a court of justice, they\r\nhave plundered and sunk them by the way or in obscure places where no\r\nevidence could arise against them, maltreated the crews, and abandoned\r\nthem in boats in the open sea or on desert shores without food or\r\ncovering. These enormities appearing to be unreached by any control of\r\ntheir sovereigns, I found it necessary to equip a force to cruise within\r\nour own seas, to arrest all vessels of these descriptions found hovering\r\non our coasts within the limits of the Gulf Stream and to bring the\r\noffenders in for trial as pirates.\r\n\r\nThe same system of hovering on our coasts and harbors under color of\r\nseeking enemies has been also carried on by public armed ships to the\r\ngreat annoyance and oppression of our commerce. New principles, too,\r\nhave been interpolated into the law of nations, founded neither in\r\njustice nor the usage or acknowledgment of nations. According to these\r\na belligerent takes to itself a commerce with its own enemy which it\r\ndenies to a neutral on the ground of its aiding that enemy in the war;\r\nbut reason revolts at such an inconsistency, and the neutral having\r\nequal right with the belligerent to decide the question, the interests\r\nof our constituents and the duty of maintaining the authority of reason,\r\nthe only umpire between just nations, impose on us the obligation of\r\nproviding an effectual and determined opposition to a doctrine so\r\ninjurious to the rights of peaceable nations. Indeed, the confidence\r\nwe ought to have in the justice of others still countenances the hope\r\nthat a sounder view of those rights will of itself induce from every\r\nbelligerent a more correct observance of them.\r\n\r\nWith Spain our negotiations for a settlement of differences have not\r\nhad a satisfactory issue. Spoliations during a former war, for which\r\nshe had formally acknowledged herself responsible, have been refused\r\nto be compensated but on conditions affecting other claims in no wise\r\nconnected with them. Yet the same practices are renewed in the present\r\nwar and are already of great amount. On the Mobile, our commerce passing\r\nthrough that river continues to be obstructed by arbitrary duties and\r\nvexatious searches. Propositions for adjusting amicably the boundaries\r\nof Louisiana have not been acceded to. While, however, the right is\r\nunsettled, we have avoided changing the state of things by taking new\r\nposts or strengthening ourselves in the disputed territories, in the\r\nhope that the other power would not by a contrary conduct oblige us to\r\nmeet their example and endanger conflicts of authority the issue of\r\nwhich may not be easily controlled. But in this hope we have now reason\r\nto lessen our confidence. Inroads have been recently made into the\r\nTerritories of Orleans and the Mississippi, our citizens have been\r\nseized and their property plundered in the very parts of the former\r\nwhich had been actually delivered up by Spain, and this by the regular\r\nofficers and soldiers of that Government. I have therefore found it\r\nnecessary at length to give orders to our troops on that frontier to be\r\nin readiness to protect our citizens, and to repel by arms any similar\r\naggressions in future. Other details necessary for your full information\r\nof the state of things between this country and that shall be the\r\nsubject of another communication.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing these injuries from some of the belligerent powers the\r\nmoderation, the firmness, and the wisdom of the Legislature will all be\r\ncalled into action. We ought still to hope that time and a more correct\r\nestimate of interest as well as of character will produce the justice\r\nwe are bound to expect. But should any nation deceive itself by false\r\ncalculations, and disappoint that expectation, we must join in the\r\nunprofitable contest of trying which party can do the other the most\r\nharm. Some of these injuries may perhaps admit a peaceable remedy. Where\r\nthat is competent it is always the most desirable. But some of them are\r\nof a nature to be met by force only, and all of them may lead to it.\r\nI can not, therefore, but recommend such preparations as circumstances\r\ncall for. The first object is to place our seaport towns out of the\r\ndanger of insult. Measures have been already taken for furnishing them\r\nwith heavy cannon for the service of such land batteries as may make a\r\npart of their defense against armed vessels approaching them. In aid of\r\nthese it is desirable we should have a competent number of gunboats, and\r\nthe number, to be competent, must be considerable. If immediately begun,\r\nthey may be in readiness for service at the opening of the next season.\r\nWhether it will be necessary to augment our land forces will be decided\r\nby occurrences probably in the course of your session. In the meantime\r\nyou will consider whether it would not be expedient for a state of peace\r\nas well as of war so to organize or class the militia as would enable\r\nus on any sudden emergency to call for the services of the younger\r\nportions, unencumbered with the old and those having families. Upward\r\nof 300,000 able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 26 years, which\r\nthe last census shews we may now count within our limits, will furnish\r\na competent number for offense or defense in any point where they may\r\nbe wanted, and will give time for raising regular forces after the\r\nnecessity of them shall become certain; and the reducing to the early\r\nperiod of life all its active service can not but be desirable to our\r\nyounger citizens of the present as well as future times, inasmuch as it\r\nengages to them in more advanced age a quiet and undisturbed repose in\r\nthe bosom of their families. I can not, then, but earnestly recommend\r\nto your early consideration the expediency of so modifying our militia\r\nsystem as, by a separation of the more active part from that which is\r\nless so, we may draw from it when necessary an efficient corps fit for\r\nreal and active service, and to be called to it in regular rotation.\r\n\r\nConsiderable provision has been made under former authorities from\r\nCongress of materials for the construction of ships of war of 74 guns.\r\nThese materials are on hand subject to the further will of the\r\nLegislature.\r\n\r\nAn immediate prohibition of the exportation of arms and ammunition is\r\nalso submitted to your determination.\r\n\r\nTurning from these unpleasant views of violence and wrong, I\r\ncongratulate you on the liberation of our fellow-citizens who were\r\nstranded on the coast of Tripoli and made prisoners of war. In a\r\ngovernment bottomed on the will of all the life and liberty of every\r\nindividual citizen become interesting to all. In the treaty, therefore,\r\nwhich has concluded our warfare with that State an article for the\r\nransom of our citizens has been agreed to. An operation by land by a\r\nsmall band of our countrymen and others, engaged for the occasion in\r\nconjunction with the troops of the ex-Bashaw of that country, gallantly\r\nconducted by our late consul, Eaton, and their successful enterprise\r\non the city of Derne, contributed doubtless to the impression which\r\nproduced peace, and the conclusion of this prevented opportunities of\r\nwhich the officers and men of our squadron destined for Tripoli would\r\nhave availed themselves to emulate the acts of valor exhibited by\r\ntheir brethren in the attack of the last year. Reflecting with high\r\nsatisfaction on the distinguished bravery displayed whenever occasions\r\npermitted in the late Mediterranean service, I think it would be an\r\nuseful encouragement as well as a just reward to make an opening for\r\nsome present promotion by enlarging our peace establishment of captains\r\nand lieutenants.\r\n\r\nWith Tunis some misunderstandings have arisen not yet sufficiently\r\nexplained, but friendly discussions with their ambassador recently\r\narrived and a mutual disposition to do whatever is just and reasonable\r\ncan not fail of dissipating these, so that we may consider our peace on\r\nthat coast, generally, to be on as sound a footing as it has been at any\r\npreceding time. Still, it will not be expedient to withdraw immediately\r\nthe whole of our force from that sea.\r\n\r\nThe law providing for a naval peace establishment fixes the number of\r\nfrigates which shall be kept in constant service in time of peace, and\r\nprescribes that they shall be manned by not more than two-thirds of\r\ntheir complement of seamen and ordinary seamen. Whether a frigate may\r\nbe trusted to two-thirds only of her proper complement of men must\r\ndepend on the nature of the service on which she is ordered; that may\r\nsometimes, for her safety as well as to insure her object, require her\r\nfullest complement. In adverting to this subject Congress will perhaps\r\nconsider whether the best limitation on the Executive discretion in\r\nthis case would not be by the number of seamen which may be employed in\r\nthe whole service rather than by the number of the vessels. Occasions\r\noftener arise for the employment of small than of large vessels, and it\r\nwould lessen risk as well as expense to be authorized to employ them of\r\npreference. The limitation suggested by the number of seamen would admit\r\na selection of vessels best adapted to the service.\r\n\r\nOur Indian neighbors are advancing, many of them with spirit, and\r\nothers beginning to engage in the pursuits of agriculture and household\r\nmanufacture. They are becoming sensible that the earth yields\r\nsubsistence with less labor and more certainty than the forest, and find\r\nit their interest from time to time to dispose of parts of their surplus\r\nand waste lands for the means of improving those they occupy and of\r\nsubsisting their families while they are preparing their farms. Since\r\nyour last session the Northern tribes have sold to us the lands between\r\nthe Connecticut Reserve and the former Indian boundary and those on the\r\nOhio from the same boundary to the rapids and for a considerable depth\r\ninland. The Chickasaws and Cherokees have sold us the country between\r\nand adjacent to the two districts of Tennessee, and the Creeks the\r\nresidue of their lands in the fork of Ocmulgee up to the Ulcofauhatche.\r\nThe three former purchases are important, inasmuch as they consolidate\r\ndisjoined parts of our settled country and render their intercourse\r\nsecure; and the second particularly so, as, with the small point on\r\nthe river which we expect is by this time ceded by the Piankeshaws, it\r\ncompletes our possession of the whole of both banks of the Ohio from its\r\nsource to near its mouth, and the navigation of that river is thereby\r\nrendered forever safe to our citizens settled and settling on its\r\nextensive waters. The purchase from the Creeks, too, has been for some\r\ntime particularly interesting to the State of Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe several treaties which have been mentioned will be submitted to both\r\nHouses of Congress for the exercise of their respective functions.\r\n\r\nDeputations now on their way to the seat of Government from various\r\nnations of Indians inhabiting the Missouri and other parts beyond the\r\nMississippi come charged with assurances of their satisfaction with the\r\nnew relations in which they are placed with us, of their dispositions\r\nto cultivate our peace and friendship, and their desire to enter into\r\ncommercial intercourse with us. A state of our progress in exploring the\r\nprincipal rivers of that country, and of the information respecting them\r\nhitherto obtained, will be communicated so soon as we shall receive some\r\nfurther relations which we have reason shortly to expect.\r\n\r\nThe receipts at the Treasury during the year ending on the 30th day of\r\nSeptember last have exceeded the sum of $13,000,000, which, with not\r\nquite five millions in the Treasury at the beginning of the year, have\r\nenabled us after meeting other demands to pay nearly two millions of the\r\ndebt contracted under the British treaty and convention, upward of four\r\nmillions of principal of the public debt, and four millions of interest.\r\nThese payments, with those which had been made in three years and a half\r\npreceding, have extinguished of the funded debt nearly eighteen millions\r\nof principal. Congress by their act of November 10, 1803, authorized us\r\nto borrow $1,750,000 toward meeting the claims of our citizens assumed\r\nby the convention with France. We have not, however, made use of this\r\nauthority, because the sum of four millions and a half, which remained\r\nin the Treasury on the same 30th day of September last, with the\r\nreceipts which we may calculate on for the ensuing year, besides paying\r\nthe annual sum of $8,000,000 appropriated to the funded debt and meeting\r\nall the current demands which may be expected, will enable us to pay\r\nthe whole sum of $3,750,000 assumed by the French convention and still\r\nleave us a surplus of nearly $1,000,000 at our free disposal. Should\r\nyou concur in the provisions of arms and armed vessels recommended by\r\nthe circumstances of the times, this surplus will furnish the means of\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\nOn this first occasion of addressing Congress since, by the choice of\r\nmy constituents, I have entered on a second term of administration, I\r\nembrace the opportunity to give this public assurance that I will exert\r\nmy best endeavors to administer faithfully the executive department,\r\nand will zealously cooperate with you in every measure which may\r\ntend to secure the liberty, property, and personal safety of our\r\nfellow-citizens, and to consolidate the republican forms and principles\r\nof our Government.\r\n\r\nIn the course of your session you shall receive all the aid which I\r\ncan give for the dispatch of public business, and all the information\r\nnecessary for your deliberations, of which the interests of our own\r\ncountry and the confidence reposed in us by others will admit a\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 6, 1805.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe depredations which had been committed on the commerce of the United\r\nStates during a preceding war by persons under the authority of Spain\r\nare sufficiently known to all. These made it a duty to require from that\r\nGovernment indemnifications for our injured citizens. A convention was\r\naccordingly entered into between the minister of the United States at\r\nMadrid and the minister of that Government for foreign affairs, by which\r\nit was agreed that spoliations committed by Spanish subjects and carried\r\ninto ports of Spain should be paid for by that nation, and that those\r\ncommitted by French subjects and carried into Spanish ports should\r\nremain for further discussion. Before this convention was returned\r\nto Spain with our ratification the transfer of Louisiana by France to\r\nthe United States took place, an event as unexpected as disagreeable\r\nto Spain. From that moment she seemed to change her conduct and\r\ndispositions toward us. It was first manifested by her protest against\r\nthe right of France to alienate Louisiana to us, which, however, was\r\nsoon retracted and the right confirmed. Then high offense was manifested\r\nat the act of Congress establishing a collection district on the Mobile,\r\nalthough by an authentic declaration immediately made it was expressly\r\nconfined to our acknowledged limits; and she now refused to ratify the\r\nconvention signed by her own minister under the eye of his Sovereign\r\nunless we would consent to alterations of its terms which would have\r\naffected our claims against her for the spoliations by French subjects\r\ncarried into Spanish ports.\r\n\r\nTo obtain justice as well as to restore friendship I thought a special\r\nmission advisable, and accordingly appointed James Monroe minister\r\nextraordinary and plenipotentiary to repair to Madrid, and in\r\nconjunction with our minister resident there to endeavor to procure a\r\nratification of the former convention and to come to an understanding\r\nwith Spain as to the boundaries of Louisiana. It appeared at once that\r\nher policy was to reserve herself for events, and in the meantime to\r\nkeep our differences in an undetermined state. This will be evident\r\nfrom the papers now communicated to you. After nearly five months of\r\nfruitless endeavor to bring them to some definite and satisfactory\r\nresult, our ministers ended the conferences without having been able to\r\nobtain indemnity for spoliations of any description or any satisfaction\r\nas to the boundaries of Louisiana, other than a declaration that we had\r\nno rights eastward of the Iberville, and that our line to the west was\r\none which would have left us but a string of land on that bank of the\r\nriver Mississippi. Our injured citizens were thus left without any\r\nprospect of retribution from the wrongdoer, and as to boundary each\r\nparty was to take its own course. That which they have chosen to pursue\r\nwill appear from the documents now communicated. They authorize the\r\ninference that it is their intention to advance on our possessions until\r\nthey shall be repressed by an opposing force. Considering that Congress\r\nalone is constitutionally invested with the power of changing our\r\ncondition from peace to war, I have thought it my duty to await their\r\nauthority for using force in any degree which could be avoided. I have\r\nbarely instructed the officers stationed in the neighborhood of the\r\naggressions to protect our citizens from violence, to patrol within the\r\nborders actually delivered to us, and not to go out of them but when\r\nnecessary to repel an inroad or to rescue a citizen or his property; and\r\nthe Spanish officers remaining at New Orleans are required to depart\r\nwithout further delay. It ought to be noted here that since the late\r\nchange in the state of affairs in Europe Spain has ordered her cruisers\r\nand courts to respect our treaty with her.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of France and the part she may take in the misunderstandings\r\nbetween the United States and Spain are too important to be\r\nunconsidered. She was prompt and decided in her declarations that our\r\ndemands on Spain for French spoliations carried into Spanish ports were\r\nincluded in the settlement between the United States and France. She\r\ntook at once the ground that she had acquired no right from Spain, and\r\nhad meant to deliver us none eastward of the Iberville, her silence as\r\nto the western boundary leaving us to infer her opinion might be against\r\nSpain in that quarter. Whatever direction she might mean to give to\r\nthese differences, it does not appear that she has contemplated their\r\nproceeding to actual rupture, or that at the date of our last advices\r\nfrom Paris her Government had any suspicion of the hostile attitude\r\nSpain had taken here; on the contrary, we have reason to believe that\r\nshe was disposed to effect a settlement on a plan analogous to what our\r\nministers had proposed, and so comprehensive as to remove as far as\r\npossible the grounds of future collision and controversy on the eastern\r\nas well as western side of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThe present crisis in Europe is favorable for pressing such a\r\nsettlement, and not a moment should be lost in availing ourselves of\r\nit. Should it pass unimproved, our situation would become much more\r\ndifficult. Formal war is not necessary--it is not probable it will\r\nfollow; but the protection of our citizens, the spirit and honor of our\r\ncountry require that force should be interposed to a certain degree it\r\nwill probably contribute to advance the object of peace,\r\n\r\nBut the course to be pursued will require the command of means which\r\nit belongs to Congress exclusively to yield or to deny. To them I\r\ncommunicate every fact material for their information and the documents\r\nnecessary to enable them to judge for themselves. To their wisdom, then,\r\nI look for the course I am to pursue, and will pursue with sincere zeal\r\nthat which they shall approve.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 11, 1805.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now lay before the Senate the several treaties and conventions\r\nfollowing, which have been entered into on the part of the United\r\nStates since their last session:\r\n\r\n1. A treaty of peace and amity between the United States of America\r\nand the Bashaw, Bey, and subjects of Tripoli, in Barbary.\r\n\r\n2. A treaty between the United States and the Wyandot, Ottawa, Chippewa,\r\nMunsee, and Delaware, Shawnee, and Potawatamie nations of Indians.\r\n\r\n3. A treaty between the United States and the agents of the Connecticut\r\nLand Companies on one part and the Wyandot, Ottawa, Chippewa, Munsee,\r\nand Delaware, Shawnee, and Potawatamie nations of Indians.\r\n\r\n4. A treaty between the United States and the Delawares, Potawatamies,\r\nMiamis, Eel-rivers, and Weeas.\r\n\r\n5. A treaty between the United States and the Chickasaw Nation of\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\n6. A treaty between the United States of America and the Cherokee\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\n7. A convention between the United States and the Creek Nation of\r\nIndians; with the several documents necessary for their explanation.\r\n\r\nThe Senate having dissented to the ratification of the treaty with the\r\nCreeks submitted to them at their last session, which gave a sum of\r\n$200,000 for the country thereby conveyed, it is proper now to observe\r\nthat instead of that sum, which was equivalent to a perpetual annuity of\r\n$12,000, the present purchase gives them an annuity of $12,000 for eight\r\nyears only and of $11,000 for ten years more, the payments of which\r\nwould be effected by a present sum of $130,000 placed at an annual\r\ninterest of 6 per cent. If from this sum we deduct the reasonable\r\nvalue of the road ceded through the whole length of their country from\r\nOcmulgee toward New Orleans, a road of indispensable necessity to us,\r\nthe present convention will be found to give little more than the half\r\nof the sum which was formerly proposed to be given. This difference is\r\nthought sufficient to justify the presenting this subject a second time\r\nto the Senate. On these several treaties I have to request that the\r\nSenate will advise whether I shall ratify them or not.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 23, 1805.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe governor and presiding judge of the Territory of Michigan have made\r\na report to me of the state of that Territory, several matters in which\r\nbeing within the reach of the legislative authority only, I lay the\r\nreport before Congress.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 31, 1805.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now communicate to the House of Representatives all the information\r\nwhich the executive offices furnish on the subject of their resolution\r\nof the 23d instant respecting the States indebted to the United States.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 10, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the request of the Senate expressed in their\r\nresolution of December 27, I now lay before them such documents and\r\npapers (there being no other information in my possession) as relate to\r\ncomplaints by the Government of France against the commerce carried on\r\nby the citizens of the United States to the French island of St.\r\nDomingo.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 13, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAccording to the request of the Senate of December 30, I now lay before\r\nthem the correspondence of the naval commanders Barron and Rodgers and\r\nof Mr. Eaton, late consul at Tunis, respecting the progress of the\r\nwar with Tripoli, antecedent to the treaty with the Bey and Regency\r\nof Tripoli, and respecting the negotiations for the same, and the\r\ncommission and instructions of Mr. Eaton, with such other correspondence\r\nin possession of the offices as I suppose may be useful to the Senate in\r\ntheir deliberations upon the said treaty.\r\n\r\nThe instructions which were given to Mr. Lear, the consul-general at\r\nAlgiers, respecting the negotiations for the said treaty accompanied\r\nthe treaty and the message concerning the same, and are now with them\r\nin possession of the Senate.\r\n\r\nSo much of these papers has been extracted and communicated to the House\r\nof Representatives as relates to the principles of the cooperation\r\nbetween the United States and Hamet Caramalli, which is the subject\r\nof a joint message to both Houses of Congress bearing equal date with\r\nthe present, and as those now communicated to the Senate comprehend\r\nthe whole of that matter, I request that they may be considered as\r\ncomprising the documents stated in that message as accompanying it.\r\nBeing mostly originals or sole copies, a return of them is requested\r\nat the convenience of the Senate.\r\n\r\nWe have no letter from Mr. Lear respecting Tripoline affairs of later\r\ndate than that of July 5, which was transmitted to the Senate with the\r\ntreaty, nor, consequently, any later information what steps have been\r\ntaken to carry into effect the stipulation for the delivery of the wife\r\nand children of the brother of the reigning Bashaw of Tripoli.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 13, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress the application of Hamet Caramalli, elder brother\r\nof the reigning Bashaw of Tripoli, soliciting from the United States\r\nattention to his services and sufferings in the late war against\r\nthat State; and in order to possess them of the ground on which that\r\napplication stands, the facts shall be stated according to the views\r\nand information of the Executive.\r\n\r\nDuring the war with Tripoli it was suggested that Hamet Caramalli, elder\r\nbrother of the reigning Bashaw, and driven by him from his throne,\r\nmeditated the recovery of his inheritance, and that a concert in action\r\nwith us was desirable to him. We considered that concerted operations\r\nby those who have a common enemy were entirely justifiable, and might\r\nproduce effects favorable to both without binding either to guarantee\r\nthe objects of the other. But the distance of the scene, the\r\ndifficulties of communication, and the uncertainty of our information\r\ninducing the less confidence in the measure, it was committed to our\r\nagents as one which might be resorted to if it promised to promote our\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nMr. Eaton, however (our late consul), on his return from the\r\nMediterranean, possessing personal knowledge of the scene and having\r\nconfidence in the effect of a joint operation, we authorized Commodore\r\nBarron, then proceeding with his squadron, to enter into an\r\nunderstanding with Hamet if he should deem it useful; and as it was\r\nrepresented that he would need some aids of arms and ammunition, and\r\neven of money, he was authorized to furnish them to a moderate extent,\r\naccording to the prospect of utility to be expected from it. In order to\r\navail him of the advantages of Mr. Eaton's knowledge of circumstances,\r\nan occasional employment was provided for the latter as an agent for the\r\nNavy in that sea. Our expectation was that an intercourse should be kept\r\nup between the ex-Bashaw and the commodore; that while the former moved\r\non by land our squadron should proceed with equal pace, so as to arrive\r\nat their destination together and to attack the common enemy by land and\r\nsea at the same time. The instructions of June 6 to Commodore Barron\r\nshew that a cooperation only was intended, and by no means an union\r\nof our object with the fortune of the ex-Bashaw, and the commodore's\r\nletters of March 22 and May 19 prove that he had the most correct idea\r\nof our intentions. His verbal instructions, indeed, to Mr. Eaton and\r\nCaptain Hull, if the expressions are accurately committed to writing\r\nby those gentlemen, do not limit the extent of his cooperation as\r\nrigorously as he probably intended; but it is certain from the\r\nex-Bashaw's letter of January 3, written when he was proceeding to join\r\nMr. Eaton, and in which he says, \"Your operations should be carried on\r\nby sea, mine by land,\" that he left the position in which he was with a\r\nproper idea of the nature of the cooperation. If Mr. Eaton's subsequent\r\nconvention should appear to bring forward other objects, his letter of\r\nApril 29 and May 1 views this convention but as provisional, the second\r\narticle, as he expressly states, guarding it against any ill effect; and\r\nhis letter of June 30 confirms this construction.\r\n\r\nIn the event it was found that after placing the ex-Bashaw in possession\r\nof Derne, one of the most important cities and provinces of the country,\r\nwhere he had resided himself as governor, lie was totally unable to\r\ncommand any resources or to bear any part in cooperation with us. This\r\nhope was then at an end, and we certainly had never contemplated, nor\r\nwere we prepared, to land an army of our own, or to raise, pay, or\r\nsubsist an army of Arabs to march from Derne to Tripoli and to carry\r\non a land war at such a distance from our resources. Our means and our\r\nauthority were merely naval, and that such were the expectations of\r\nHamet his letter of June 29 is an unequivocal acknowledgment. While,\r\ntherefore, an impression from the capture of Derne might still operate\r\nat Tripoli, and an attack on that place from our squadron was daily\r\nexpected. Colonel Lear thought it the best moment to listen to overtures\r\nof peace then made by the Bashaw. He did so, and while urging provisions\r\nfor the United States he paid attention also to the interests of Hamet,\r\nbut was able to effect nothing more than to engage the restitution of\r\nhis family, and even the persevering in this demand suspended for some\r\ntime the conclusion of the treaty.\r\n\r\nIn operations at such a distance it becomes necessary to leave much to\r\nthe discretion of the agents employed, but events may still turn up\r\nbeyond the limits of that discretion. Unable in such a case to consult\r\nhis Government, a zealous citizen will act as he believes that would\r\ndirect him were it apprised of the circumstances, and will take on\r\nhimself the responsibility. In all these cases the purity and patriotism\r\nof the motives should shield the agent from blame, and even secure a\r\nsanction where the error is not too injurious. Should it be thought by\r\nany that the verbal instructions said to have been given by Commodore\r\nBarron to Mr. Eaton amount to a stipulation that the United States\r\nshould place Hamet Caramalli on the throne of Tripoli--a stipulation so\r\nentirely unauthorized, so far beyond our views, and so onerous could not\r\nbe sanctioned by our Government--or should Hamet Caramalli, contrary\r\nto the evidence of his letters of January 3 and June 29, be thought to\r\nhave left the position which he now seems to regret, under a mistaken\r\nexpectation that we were at all events to place him on his throne, on\r\nan appeal to the liberality of the nation something equivalent to the\r\nreplacing him in his former situation might be worthy its consideration.\r\n\r\nA nation by establishing a character of liberality and magnanimity gains\r\nin the friendship and respect of others more than the worth of mere\r\nmoney. This appeal is now made by Hamet Caramalli to the United States.\r\nThe ground he has taken being different not only from our views but from\r\nthose expressed by himself on former occasions, Mr. Eaton was desired to\r\nstate whether any verbal communications passed from him to Hamet which\r\nhad varied what we saw in writing. His answer of December 5 is herewith\r\ntransmitted, and has rendered it still more necessary that in presenting\r\nto the Legislature the application of Hamet I should present them at\r\nthe same time an exact statement of the views and proceedings of the\r\nExecutive through this whole business, that they may clearly understand\r\nthe ground on which we are placed. It is accompanied by all the papers\r\nwhich bear any relation to the principles of the cooperation, and which\r\ncan inform their judgment in deciding on the application of Hamet\r\nCaramalli.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 15, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now render to Congress an account of the grant of $20,000 for the\r\ncontingent charges of Government by an act making appropriations for the\r\nsupport of Government for the year 1805. Of that sum $1,987.50 have been\r\nnecessarily applied to the support of the Territorial governments of\r\nMichigan and Louisiana until an opportunity could occur of making a\r\nspecific appropriation for that purpose. The balance of $18,012.50\r\nremains in the Treasury.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 17, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn my message to both Houses of Congress at the opening of their present\r\nsession I submitted to their attention, among other subjects, the\r\noppression of our commerce and navigation by the irregular practices\r\nof armed vessels, public and private, and by the introduction of new\r\nprinciples derogatory of the rights of neutrals and unacknowledged by\r\nthe usage of nations.\r\n\r\nThe memorials of several bodies of merchants of the United States are\r\nnow communicated, and will develop these principles and practices which\r\nare producing the most ruinous effects on our lawful commerce and\r\nnavigation.\r\n\r\nThe rights of a neutral to carry on commercial intercourse with every\r\npart of the dominions of a belligerent permitted by the laws of the\r\ncountry (with the exception of blockaded ports and contraband of war)\r\nwas believed to have been decided between Great Britain and the United\r\nStates by the sentence of their commissioners mutually appointed\r\nto decide on that and other questions of difference between the two\r\nnations, and by the actual payment of the damages awarded by them\r\nagainst Great Britain for the infractions of that right. When,\r\ntherefore, it was perceived that the same principle was revived with\r\nothers more novel and extending the injury, instructions were given\r\nto the minister plenipotentiary of the United States at the Court of\r\nLondon, and remonstrances duly made by him on this subject, as will\r\nappear by documents transmitted herewith. These were followed by a\r\npartial and temporary suspension only, without any disavowal of the\r\nprinciple. He has therefore been instructed to urge this subject anew,\r\nto bring it more fully to the bar of reason, and to insist on rights too\r\nevident and too important to be surrendered. In the meantime the evil is\r\nproceeding under adjudications founded on the principle which is denied.\r\nUnder these circumstances the subject presents itself for the\r\nconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nOn the impressment of our seamen our remonstrances have never been\r\nintermitted. A hope existed at one moment of an arrangement which might\r\nhave been submitted to, but it soon passed away, and the practice,\r\nthough relaxed at times in the distant seas, has been constantly pursued\r\nin those in our neighborhood. The grounds on which the reclamations on\r\nthis subject have been urged will appear in an extract from instructions\r\nto our minister at London now communicated.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 17, 1806\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe inclosed letter from the minister plenipotentiary of the United\r\nStates at the Court of London contains interesting information on\r\nthe subjects of my other message of this date. It is sent separately\r\nand confidentially because its publication may discourage frank\r\ncommunications between our ministers generally and the Governments\r\nwith which they reside, and especially between the same ministers.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 24, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nA convention has been entered into between the United States and the\r\nCherokee Nation for the extinguishment of the rights of the latter, and\r\nof some unsettled claims in the country north of the river Tennessee,\r\ntherein described. This convention is now laid before the Senate for\r\ntheir advice and consent as to its ratification.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 27, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAccording to the desire of the Senate expressed in their resolution of\r\nthe 10th instant, I now communicate to them a report of the Secretary of\r\nState, with its documents, stating certain new principles attempted to\r\nbe introduced on the subject of neutral rights, injurious to the rights\r\nand interests of the United States. These, with my message to both\r\nHouses of the 17th instant and the documents accompanying it, fulfill\r\nthe desires of the Senate as far as it can be done by any information\r\nin my possession which is authentic and not publicly known.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 29, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nHaving received from sundry merchants at Baltimore a memorial on the\r\nsame subject with those I communicated to Congress with my message of\r\nthe 17th instant, I now communicate this also as a proper sequel to the\r\nformer, and as making a part of the mass of evidence of the violations\r\nof our rights on the ocean.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 3, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nA letter has been received from the governor of South Carolina covering\r\nan act of the legislature of that State ceding to the United States\r\nvarious forts and fortifications and sites for the erection of forts in\r\nthat State on the conditions therein expressed. This letter and the act\r\nit covered are now communicated to Congress.\r\n\r\nI am not informed whether the positions ceded are the best which\r\ncan be taken for securing their respective objects. No doubt is\r\nentertained that the legislature deemed them such. The river of Beaufort,\r\nparticularly, said to be accessible to ships of very large size and\r\ncapable of yielding them a protection which they can not find elsewhere\r\nbut very far to the north, is from these circumstances so interesting to\r\nthe Union in general as to merit particular attention and inquiry as to\r\nthe positions on it best calculated for health as well as safety.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 3, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn the course of the last year the following treaties and conventions\r\nfor the extinguishment of Indian title to lands within our limits were\r\nentered into on behalf of the United States:\r\n\r\nA treaty between the United States and the Wyandot, Ottawa, Chippeway,\r\nMunsee and Delaware, Shawanee and Pottawatamy nations of Indians.\r\n\r\nA treaty between the United States and the agents of the Connecticut\r\nLand Company on one part and the Wyandot and Ottawa, Chippeway, Munsey\r\nand Delaware, Shawanee and Pottawatamy nations of Indians.\r\n\r\nA treaty between the United States and the Delawares, Pottawatamies,\r\nMiamis, Eel-rivers, and Weas.\r\n\r\nA treaty between the United States and the Chickasaw Nation of Indians.\r\n\r\nTwo treaties between the United States and the Cherokee Indians.\r\n\r\nA convention between the United States and the Creek Nation of Indians.\r\n\r\nThe Senate having advised and consented to the ratification of these\r\nseveral treaties and conventions, I now lay them before both Houses of\r\nCongress for the exercise of their constitutional powers as to the means\r\nof fulfilling them.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 6, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nSince the date of my message of January 17 a letter of the 26th of\r\nNovember has been received from the minister plenipotentiary of the\r\nUnited States at London, covering one from the secretary for foreign\r\naffairs of that Government, which, being on the subject of that message,\r\nis now transmitted for the information of Congress. Although nothing\r\nforbids the substance of these letters from being communicated without\r\nreserve, yet so many ill effects proceed from the publications of\r\ncorrespondences between ministers remaining still in office that I can\r\nnot but recommend that these letters be not permitted to be formally\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nTH; JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 19, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of a measure proposed to Congress by a message of January\r\n18, 1803, and sanctioned by their approbation for carrying it into\r\nexecution, Captain Meriwether Lewis, of the First Regiment of infantry,\r\nwas appointed, with a party of men, to explore the river Missouri from\r\nits mouth to its source, and, crossing the highlands by the shortest\r\nportage, to seek the best water communication thence to the Pacific\r\nOcean; and Lieutenant Clarke was appointed second in command. They were\r\nto enter into conference with the Indian nations on their route with\r\na view to the establishment of commerce with them. They entered the\r\nMissouri May 14, 1804, and on the 1st of November took up their winter\r\nquarters near the Mandan towns, 1,609 miles above the mouth of the\r\nriver, in latitude 47° 21' 47\" north and longitude 99° 24' 45\" west from\r\nGreenwich. On the 8th of April, 1805, they proceeded up the river in\r\npursuance of the objects prescribed to them. A letter of the preceding\r\nday, April 7th, from Captain Lewis is herewith communicated. During\r\nhis stay among the Mandans he had been able to lay down the Missouri\r\naccording to courses and distances taken on his passage up it, corrected\r\nby frequent observations of longitude and latitude, and to add to the\r\nactual survey of this portion of the river a general map of the country\r\nbetween the Mississippi and Pacific from the thirty-fourth to the\r\nfifty-fourth degree of latitude. These additions are from information\r\ncollected from Indians with whom he had opportunities of communicating\r\nduring his journey and residence with them. Copies of this map are now\r\npresented to both Houses of Congress. With these I communicate also a\r\nstatistical view, procured and forwarded by him, of the Indian nations\r\ninhabiting the Territory of Louisiana and the countries adjacent to\r\nits northern and western borders, of their commerce, and of other\r\ninteresting circumstances respecting them.\r\n\r\nIn order to render the statement as complete as may be of the Indians\r\ninhabiting the country west of the Mississippi, I add Dr. Sibley's\r\naccount of those residing in and adjacent to the Territory of Orleans.\r\n\r\nI communicate also, from the same person, an account of the Red River,\r\naccording to the best information he had been able to collect.\r\n\r\nHaving been disappointed, after considerable preparation, in the purpose\r\nof sending an exploring party up that river in the summer of 1804, it\r\nwas thought best to employ the autumn of that year in procuring a\r\nknowledge of an interesting branch of the river called the Washita.\r\n\r\nThis was undertaken under the direction of Mr. Dunbar, of Natchez, a\r\ncitizen of distinguished science, who had aided and continues to aid\r\nus with his disinterested and valuable services in the prosecution of\r\nthese enterprises. He ascended the river to the remarkable hot springs\r\nnear it, in latitude 34° 31' 4.16\", longitude 92° 50' 45\" west from\r\nGreenwich, taking its courses and distances, and correcting them by\r\nfrequent celestial observations. Extracts from his observations and\r\ncopies of his map of the river from its mouth to the hot springs make\r\npart of the present communications. The examination of the Red River\r\nitself is but now commencing.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 5, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAccording to the request of the Senate expressed in their resolution of\r\n3d instant, I now transmit the extract of a letter from the Secretary of\r\nState to the minister plenipotentiary of the United States at Paris, the\r\nanswer to that letter, and two letters from Henry Waddell, a citizen of\r\nthe United States, relative to the interference of the said minister\r\nin the case of the ship _New Jersey_ and to the principles alleged to\r\nhave been laid down on that occasion.\r\n\r\nThere are in the office of the Department of State several printed\r\ndocuments in this case by the agent of those interested in the ship,\r\nwhich are voluminous and in French. If these be within the scope of the\r\nrequest of the Senate, the printed copies can be sent in immediately,\r\nbut if translations be necessary some considerable time will be\r\nrequisite for their execution. On this subject any further desire which\r\nthe Senate shall think proper to express shall be complied with.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 7, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAccording to the request of the Senate of yesterday, I now transmit\r\nthe five printed memorials of the agent for the ship _New Jersey_, in\r\nthe one of which marked B, at the ninth page, will be found the letter\r\nrelative to it from the minister plenipotentiary of the United States\r\nat Paris to the French minister of the treasury, supposed to be the one\r\ndesignated in the resolution. We have no information of this letter but\r\nthrough the channel of the party interested in the ship, nor any proof\r\nof it more authentic than that now communicated.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 19, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIt was reasonably expected that while the limits between the territories\r\nof the United States and of Spain were unsettled neither party would\r\nhave innovated on the existing state of their respective positions.\r\nSome time since, however, we learnt that the Spanish authorities were\r\nadvancing into the disputed country to occupy new posts and make new\r\nsettlements. Unwilling to take any measures which might preclude a\r\npeaceable accommodation of differences, the officers of the United\r\nStates were ordered to confine themselves within the country on this\r\nside of the Sabine River which, by delivery of its principal post,\r\nNatchitoches, was understood to have been itself delivered up by Spain,\r\nand at the same time to permit no adverse post to be taken nor armed\r\nmen to remain within it. In consequence of these orders the commanding\r\nofficer of Natchitoches, learning that a party of Spanish troops had\r\ncrossed the Sabine River and were posting themselves on this side the\r\nAdais, sent a detachment of his force to require them to withdraw to\r\nthe other side of the Sabine, which they accordingly did.\r\n\r\nI have thought it proper to communicate to Congress the letter detailing\r\nthis incident, that they may fully understand the state of things in\r\nthat quarter and be enabled to make such provision for its security as,\r\nin their wisdom, they shall deem sufficient.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 11, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now lay before Congress a statement of the militia of the United\r\nStates according to the returns last received from the several States\r\nand Territories. It will be perceived that some of these are not of\r\nrecent dates, and that from the States of Maryland and Delaware no\r\nreturns are stated. As far as appears from our records, none were ever\r\nrendered from either of these States. From the Territories of Orleans,\r\nLouisiana, and Michigan complete returns have not yet been received.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 14, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nDuring the blockade of Tripoli by the squadron of the United States\r\na small cruiser, under the flag of Tunis, with two prizes, all of\r\ntrifling value, attempted to enter Tripoli; was turned back, warned,\r\nand, attempting again to enter, was taken and detained as prize by the\r\nsquadron. Her restitution was claimed by the Bey of Tunis with a threat\r\nof war in terms so serious that on withdrawing from the blockade of\r\nTripoli the commanding officer of the squadron thought it his duty\r\nto repair to Tunis with his squadron and to require a categorical\r\ndeclaration whether peace or war was intended. The Bey preferred\r\nexplaining himself by an ambassador to the United States, who on his\r\narrival renewed the request that the vessel and her prizes should be\r\nrestored. It was deemed proper to give this proof of friendship to the\r\nBey, and the ambassador was informed the vessels would be restored.\r\nAfterwards he made a requisition of naval stores to be sent to the Bey,\r\nin order to secure a peace for the term of three years, with a threat\r\nof war if refused. It has been refused, and the ambassador is about to\r\ndepart without receding from his threat or demand.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, and considering that the several provisions\r\nof the act of March 25, 1804, will cease in consequence of the\r\nratification of the treaty of peace with Tripoli, now advised and\r\nconsented to by the Senate, I have thought it my duty to communicate\r\nthese facts, in order that Congress may consider the expediency of\r\ncontinuing the same provisions for a limited time or making others\r\nequivalent.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 15, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe Senate having advised and consented to the ratification of a treaty\r\nconcluded with the Piankeshaw Indians for extinguishing their claim to\r\nthe country between the Wabash and Kaskaskia cessions, it is now laid\r\nbefore both Houses for the exercise of their constitutional powers as\r\nto the means of fulfilling it on our part.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 17, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe Senate having advised and consented to the ratification of a\r\nconvention between the United States and the Cherokee Indians, concluded\r\nat Washington on the 7th day of January last, for the cession of their\r\nright to the tract of country therein described, it is now laid before\r\nboth Houses of Congress for the exercise of their constitutional powers\r\ntoward the fulfillment thereof.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 18, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the request of the Senate of yesterday's date, I now\r\ncommunicate the entire correspondence between the ambassador of Tunis\r\nand the Secretary of State, from which the Senate will see that the\r\nfirst application by the ambassador for restitution of the vessels taken\r\nin violation of blockade having been yielded to, the only remaining\r\ncause of difference brought forward by him is the requisition of a\r\npresent of naval stores to secure a peace for three years, after which\r\nthe inference is obvious that a renewal of the presents is to be\r\nexpected to renew the prolongation of peace for another term. But this\r\ndemand has been pressed in verbal conferences much more explicitly and\r\npertinaciously than appears in the written correspondence. To save the\r\ndelay of copying, some originals are inclosed, with a request that they\r\nbe returned.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 19, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI nominate James Monroe, now minister plenipotentiary of the United\r\nStates at the Court of London, and William Pinkney, of Maryland, to be\r\ncommissioners plenipotentiary and extraordinary for settling all matters\r\nof difference between the United States and the United Kingdoms of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland relative to wrongs committed between the parties on\r\nthe high seas or other waters, and for establishing the principles of\r\nnavigation and commerce between them.\r\n\r\nJames Houston, of Maryland, to be judge of the court of the United\r\nStates for the district of Maryland.\r\n\r\nWillis W. Parker, of Virginia, to be collector of the district and\r\ninspector of the revenue for the port of South Quay.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Annals of Congress, Ninth Congress, second session, 685.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas satisfactory information has been received that Henry Whitby,\r\ncommanding a British armed vessel called the _Leander_, did on the\r\n25th day of the month of April last, within the waters and jurisdiction\r\nof the United States, and near to the entrance of the harbor of New\r\nYork, by a cannon shot fired from the said vessel _Leander_, commit\r\na murder on the body of John Pierce, a citizen of the United States,\r\nthen pursuing his lawful vocation within the same waters and\r\njurisdiction of the United States and near to their shores; and that\r\nthe said Henry Whitby can not at this time be brought to justice by\r\nthe ordinary process of law; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it does further appear that both before and after the said day\r\nsundry trespasses, wrongs, and unlawful interruptions and vexations on\r\ntrading vessels coming to the United States, and within their waters and\r\nvicinity, were committed by the said armed vessel the _Leander_, her\r\nofficers and people; by one other armed vessel called the _Cambrian_,\r\ncommanded by John Nairne, her officers and people; and by one other\r\narmed vessel called the _Driver_, commanded by Slingsby Simpson, her\r\nofficers and people; which vessels, being all of the same nation, were\r\naiding and assisting each other in the trespasses, interruptions, and\r\nvexations aforesaid:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, to the end that the said Henry Whitby may be brought to\r\njustice and due punishment inflicted for the said murder, I do hereby\r\nespecially enjoin and require all officers having authority, civil or\r\nmilitary, and all other persons within the limits or jurisdiction of the\r\nUnited States, wheresoever the said Henry Whitby may be found, now or\r\nhereafter, to apprehend and secure the said Henry Whitby, and him safely\r\nand diligently to deliver to the civil authority of the place, to be\r\nproceeded against according to law.\r\n\r\nAnd I do hereby further require that the said armed vessel the\r\n_Leander_, with her officers and people, and the said armed vessels the\r\n_Cambrian_ and _Driver_, their officers and people, immediately and\r\nwithout any delay depart from the harbors and wraters of the United\r\nStates. And I do forever interdict the entrance of all other vessels\r\nwhich shall be commanded by the said Henry Whitby, John Nairne, and\r\nSlingsby Simpson, or either of them.\r\n\r\nAnd if the said vessels, or any of them, shall fail to depart as\r\naforesaid, or shall reenter the harbors or waters aforesaid, I do\r\nin that case forbid all intercourse with the said armed vessels the\r\n_Leander_, the _Cambrian_, and the _Driver_, or with any of them, and\r\nthe officers and crews thereof, and do prohibit all supplies and aid\r\nfrom being furnished them, or any of them. And I do declare and make\r\nknown that if any person from or within the jurisdictional limits of the\r\nUnited States shall afford any aid to either of the said armed vessels\r\ncontrary to the prohibition contained in this proclamation, either in\r\nrepairing such vessel or in furnishing her, her officers or crew, with\r\nsupplies of any kind or in any manner whatever; or if any pilot shall\r\nassist in navigating any of the said armed vessels, unless it be for\r\nthe purpose of carrying them in the first instance beyond the limits\r\nand jurisdiction of the United States, such person or persons shall on\r\nconviction suffer all the pains and penalties by the laws provided for\r\nsuch offenses. And I do hereby enjoin and require all persons bearing\r\noffice, civil or military, within the United States, and all others\r\ncitizens or inhabitants thereof, or being within the same, with\r\nvigilance and promptitude to exert their respective authorities and\r\nto be aiding and assisting to the carrying this proclamation and every\r\npart thereof into full effect.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be\r\naffixed to these presents, and signed the same with my hand.\r\n\r\nGiven at the city of Washington, the 3d day of May, A.D. 1806, and of\r\nthe Sovereignty and Independence of the United States the thirtieth.\r\n\r\nTH.

JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JAMES MADISON,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIXTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 2, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of\r\nAmerica in Congress assembled_:\r\n\r\nIt would have given me, fellow-citizens, great satisfaction to announce\r\nin the moment of your meeting that the difficulties in our foreign\r\nrelations existing at the time of your last separation had been amicably\r\nand justly terminated. I lost no time in taking those measures which\r\nwere most likely to bring them to such a termination--by special\r\nmissions charged with such powers and instructions as in the event\r\nof failure could leave no imputation on either our moderation or\r\nforbearance. The delays which have since taken place in our negotiations\r\nwith the British Government appear to have proceeded from causes which\r\ndo not forbid the expectation that during the course of the session I\r\nmay be enabled to lay before you their final issue. What will be that of\r\nthe negotiations for settling our differences with Spain nothing which\r\nhad taken place at the date of the last dispatches enables us to\r\npronounce. On the western side of the Mississippi she advanced in\r\nconsiderable force, and took post at the settlement of Bayou Pierre, on\r\nthe Red River. This village was originally settled by France, was held\r\nby her as long as she held Louisiana, and was delivered to Spain only\r\nas a part of Louisiana. Being small, insulated, and distant, it was not\r\nobserved at the moment of redelivery to France and the United States\r\nthat she continued a guard of half a dozen men which had been stationed\r\nthere. A proposition, however, having been lately made by our commander\r\nin chief to assume the Sabine River as a temporary line of separation\r\nbetween the troops of the two nations until the issue of our\r\nnegotiations shall be known, this has been referred by the Spanish\r\ncommandant to his superior, and in the meantime he has withdrawn his\r\nforce to the western side of the Sabine River. The correspondence on\r\nthis subject now communicated will exhibit more particularly the present\r\nstate of things in that quarter.\r\n\r\nThe nature of that country requires indispensably that an unusual\r\nproportion of the force employed there should be cavalry or mounted\r\ninfantry. In order, therefore, that the commanding officer might be\r\nenabled to act with effect, I had authorized him to call on the\r\ngovernors of Orleans and Mississippi for a corps of 500 volunteer\r\ncavalry. The temporary arrangement he has proposed may perhaps render\r\nthis unnecessary; but I inform you with great pleasure of the\r\npromptitude with which the inhabitants of those Territories have\r\ntendered their services in defense of their country. It has done honor\r\nto themselves, entitled them to the confidence of their fellow-citizens\r\nin every part of the Union, and must strengthen the general\r\ndetermination to protect them efficaciously under all circumstances\r\nwhich may occur.\r\n\r\nHaving received information that in another part of the United States\r\na great number of private individuals were combining together, arming\r\nand organizing themselves contrary to law, to carry on a military\r\nexpedition against the territories of Spain, I thought it necessary,\r\nby proclamation as well as by special orders, to take measures for\r\npreventing and suppressing this enterprise, for seizing the vessels,\r\narms, and other means provided for it, and for arresting and bringing\r\nto justice its authors and abettors. It was due to that good faith\r\nwhich ought ever to be the rule of action in public as well as in\r\nprivate transactions, it was due to good order and regular government,\r\nthat while the public force was acting strictly on the defensive and\r\nmerely to protect our citizens from aggression the criminal attempts\r\nof private individuals to decide for their country the question of\r\npeace or war by commencing active and unauthorized hostilities should\r\nbe promptly and efficaciously suppressed.\r\n\r\nWhether it will be necessary to enlarge our regular force will depend on\r\nthe result of our negotiations with Spain; but as it is uncertain when\r\nthat result will be known, the provisional measures requisite for that,\r\nand to meet any pressure intervening in that quarter, will be a subject\r\nfor your early consideration.\r\n\r\nThe possession of both banks of the Mississippi reducing to a single\r\npoint the defense of that river, its waters, and the country adjacent,\r\nit becomes highly necessary to provide for that point a more adequate\r\nsecurity. Some position above its mouth, commanding the passage of the\r\nriver, should be rendered sufficiently strong to cover the armed vessels\r\nwhich may be stationed there for defense, and in conjunction with them\r\nto present an insuperable obstacle to any force attempting to pass. The\r\napproaches to the city of New Orleans from the eastern quarter also will\r\nrequire to be examined and more effectually guarded. For the internal\r\nsupport of the country the encouragement of a strong settlement on the\r\nwestern side of the Mississippi, within reach of New Orleans, will be\r\nworthy the consideration of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe gunboats authorized by an act of the last session are so advanced\r\nthat they will be ready for service in the ensuing spring. Circumstances\r\npermitted us to allow the time necessary for their more solid\r\nconstruction. As a much larger number will still be wanting to place\r\nour seaport towns and waters in that state of defense to which we are\r\ncompetent and they entitled, a similar appropriation for a further\r\nprovision for them is recommended for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nA further appropriation will also be necessary for repairing\r\nfortifications already established and the erection of such other works\r\nas may have real effect in obstructing the approach of an enemy to our\r\nseaport towns, or their remaining before them.\r\n\r\nIn a country whose constitution is derived from the will of the people,\r\ndirectly expressed by their free suffrages; where the principal\r\nexecutive functionaries and those of the legislature are renewed by them\r\nat short periods; where under the character of jurors they exercise in\r\nperson the greatest portion of the judiciary powers; where the laws are\r\nconsequently so formed and administered as to bear with equal weight and\r\nfavor on all, restraining no man in the pursuits of honest industry and\r\nsecuring to everyone the property which that acquires, it would not be\r\nsupposed that any safeguards could be needed against insurrection or\r\nenterprise on the public peace or authority. The lawrs, however, aware\r\nthat these should not be trusted to moral restraints only, have wisely\r\nprovided punishment for these crimes when committed. But would it not be\r\nsalutary to give also the means of preventing their commission? Where an\r\nenterprise is meditated by private individuals against a foreign nation\r\nin amity with the United States, powers of prevention to a certain\r\nextent are given by the laws. Would they not be as reasonable and useful\r\nwhere the enterprise preparing is against the United States? While\r\nadverting to this branch of law it is proper to observe that in\r\nenterprises meditated against foreign nations the ordinary process of\r\nbinding to the observance of the peace and good behavior, could it\r\nbe extended to acts to be done out of the jurisdiction of the United\r\nStates, would be effectual in some cases where the offender is able to\r\nkeep out of sight every indication of his purpose which could draw on\r\nhim the exercise of the powers now given by law.\r\n\r\nThe States on the coast of Barbary seem generally disposed at present\r\nto respect our peace and friendship; with Tunis alone some uncertainty\r\nremains. Persuaded that it is our interest to maintain our peace with\r\nthem on equal terms or not at all, I propose to send in due time a\r\nreen-forcement into the Mediterranean unless previous information shall\r\nshew it to be unnecessary.\r\n\r\nWe continue to receive proofs of the growing attachment of our Indian\r\nneighbors and of their disposition to place all their interests under\r\nthe patronage of the United States. These dispositions are inspired by\r\ntheir confidence in our justice and in the sincere concern we feel for\r\ntheir welfare; and as long as we discharge these high and honorable\r\nfunctions with the integrity and good faith which alone can entitle us\r\nto their continuance we may expect to reap the just reward in their\r\npeace and friendship.\r\n\r\nThe expedition of Messrs. Lewis and Clarke for exploring the river\r\nMissouri and the best communication from that to the Pacific Ocean has\r\nhad all the success which could have been expected. They have traced the\r\nMissouri nearly to its source, descended the Columbia to the Pacific\r\nOcean; ascertained with accuracy the geography of that interesting\r\ncommunication across our continent, learnt the character of the country,\r\nof its commerce and inhabitants; and it is but justice to say that\r\nMessrs. Lewis and Clarke and their brave companions have by this arduous\r\nservice deserved well of their country.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to explore the Red River, under the direction of Mr.\r\nFreeman, though conducted with a zeal and prudence meriting entire\r\napprobation, has not been equally successful. After proceeding up it\r\nabout 600 miles, nearly as far as the French settlements had extended\r\nwhile the country was in their possession, our geographers were obliged\r\nto return without completing their work.\r\n\r\nVery useful additions have also been made to our knowledge of the\r\nMississippi by Lieutenant Pike, who has ascended it to its source, and\r\nwhose journal and map, giving the details of his journey, will shortly\r\nbe ready for communication to both Houses of Congress. Those of Messrs.\r\nLewis, Clarke, and Freeman will require further time to be digested\r\nand prepared. These important surveys, in addition to those before\r\npossessed, furnish materials for commencing an accurate map of the\r\nMississippi and its western waters. Some principal rivers, however,\r\nremain still to be explored, toward which the authorization of Congress\r\nby moderate appropriations will be requisite.\r\n\r\nI congratulate you, fellow-citizens, on the approach of the period at\r\nwhich you may interpose your authority constitutionally to withdraw\r\nthe citizens of the United States from all further participation in\r\nthose violations of human rights which have been so long continued on\r\nthe unoffending inhabitants of Africa, and which the morality, the\r\nreputation, and the best interests of our country have long been eager\r\nto proscribe. Although no law you may pass can take prohibitory effect\r\ntill the first day of the year 1808, yet the intervening period is\r\nnot too long to prevent by timely notice expeditions which can not\r\nbe completed before that day.\r\n\r\nThe receipts at the Treasury during the year ending on the 30th day of\r\nSeptember last have amounted to near $15,000,000, which have enabled us,\r\nafter meeting the current demands, to pay $2,700,000 of the American\r\nclaims in part of the price of Louisiana; to pay of the funded debt\r\nupward of three millions of principal and nearly four of interest, and,\r\nin addition, to reimburse in the course of the present month near two\r\nmillions of 5-1/2 per cent stock. These payments and reimbursements of\r\nthe funded debt, with those which had been made in the four years and a\r\nhalf preceding, will at the close of the present year have extinguished\r\nupward of twenty-three millions of principal.\r\n\r\nThe duties composing the Mediterranean fund will cease by law at the\r\nend of the present session. Considering, however, that they are levied\r\nchiefly on luxuries and that we have an impost on salt, a necessary\r\nof life, the free use of which otherwise is so important, I recommend\r\nto your consideration the suppression of the duties on salt and the\r\ncontinuation of the Mediterranean fund instead thereof for a short time,\r\nafter which that also will become unnecessary for any purpose now within\r\ncontemplation.\r\n\r\nWhen both of these branches of revenue shall in this way be relinquished\r\nthere will still ere long be an accumulation of moneys in the Treasury\r\nbeyond the installments of public debt which we are permitted by\r\ncontract to pay. They can not then, without a modification assented to\r\nby the public creditors, be applied to the extinguishment of this debt\r\nand the complete liberation of our revenues, the most desirable of all\r\nobjects. Nor, if our peace continues, will they be wanting for any other\r\nexisting purpose. The question therefore now comes forward, To what\r\nother objects shall these surpluses be appropriated, and the whole\r\nsurplus of impost, after the entire discharge of the public debt, and\r\nduring those intervals when the purposes of war shall not call for them?\r\nShall we suppress the impost and give that advantage to foreign over\r\ndomestic manufactures? On a few articles of more general and necessary\r\nuse the suppression in due season will doubtless be right, but the great\r\nmass of the articles on which impost is paid are foreign luxuries,\r\npurchased by those only who are rich enough to afford themselves the\r\nuse of them. Their patriotism would certainly prefer its continuance\r\nand application to the great purposes of the public education, roads,\r\nrivers, canals, and such other objects of public improvement as it may\r\nbe thought proper to add to the constitutional enumeration of Federal\r\npowers. By these operations new channels of communication will be opened\r\nbetween the States, the lines of separation will disappear, their\r\ninterests will be identified, and their union cemented by new and\r\nindissoluble ties. Education is here placed among the articles of public\r\ncare, not that it would be proposed to take its ordinary branches out\r\nof the hands of private enterprise, which manages so much better all\r\nthe concerns to which it is equal, but a public institution can alone\r\nsupply those sciences which though rarely called for are yet necessary\r\nto complete the circle, all the parts of which contribute to the\r\nimprovement of the country and some of them to its preservation. The\r\nsubject is now proposed for the consideration of Congress, because if\r\napproved by the time the State legislatures shall have deliberated on\r\nthis extension of the Federal trusts, and the laws shall be passed and\r\nother arrangements made for their execution, the necessary funds will\r\nbe on hand and without employment. I suppose an amendment to the\r\nConstitution, by consent of the States, necessary, because the objects\r\nnow recommended are not among those enumerated in the Constitution, and\r\nto which it permits the public moneys to be applied.\r\n\r\nThe present consideration of a national establishment for education\r\nparticularly is rendered proper by this circumstance also, that if\r\nCongress, approving the proposition, shall yet think it more eligible\r\nto found it on a donation of lands, they have it now in their power to\r\nendow it with those which will be among the earliest to produce the\r\nnecessary income. This foundation would have the advantage of being\r\nindependent of war, which may suspend other improvements by requiring\r\nfor its own purposes the resources destined for them.\r\n\r\nThis, fellow-citizens, is the state of the public interests at the\r\npresent moment and according to the information now possessed. But such\r\nis the situation of the nations of Europe and such, too, the predicament\r\nin which we stand with some of them that we can not rely with certainty\r\non the present aspect of our affairs, that may change from moment\r\nto moment during the course of your session or after you shall have\r\nseparated. Our duty is, therefore, to act upon things as they are and\r\nto make a reasonable provision for whatever they may be. Were armies to\r\nbe raised whenever a speck of war is visible in our horizon, we never\r\nshould have been without them. Our resources would have been exhausted\r\non dangers which have never happened, instead of being reserved for\r\nwhat is really to take place. A steady, perhaps a quickened, pace in\r\npreparations for the defense of our seaport towns and waters; an early\r\nsettlement of the most exposed and vulnerable parts of our country; a\r\nmilitia so organized that its effective portions can be called to any\r\npoint in the Union, or volunteers instead of them to serve a sufficient\r\ntime, are means which may always be ready, yet never preying on our\r\nresources until actually called into use. They will maintain the\r\npublic interests while a more permanent force shall be in course of\r\npreparation. But much will depend on the promptitude with which these\r\nmeans can be brought into activity. If war be forced upon us, in spite\r\nof our long and vain appeals to the justice of nations, rapid and\r\nvigorous movements in its outset will go far toward securing us in its\r\ncourse and issue, and toward throwing its burthens on those who render\r\nnecessary the resort from reason to force.\r\n\r\nThe result of our negotiations, or such incidents in their course as may\r\nenable us to infer their probable issue; such further movements also\r\non our western frontiers as may shew whether war is to be pressed there\r\nwhile negotiation is protracted elsewhere, shall be communicated to\r\nyou from time to time as they become known to me, with whatever other\r\ninformation I possess or may receive, which may aid your deliberations\r\non the great national interests committed to your charge.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 3, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction to inform you that the negotiation depending\r\nbetween the United States and the Government of Great Britain is\r\nproceeding in a spirit of friendship and accommodation which promises a\r\nresult of mutual advantage. Delays, indeed, have taken place, occasioned\r\nby the long illness and subsequent death of the British minister charged\r\nwith that duty. But the commissioners appointed by that Government\r\nto resume the negotiation have shewn every disposition to hasten its\r\nprogress. It is, however, a work of time, as many arrangements are\r\nnecessary to place our future harmony on stable grounds. In the meantime\r\nwe find by the communications of our plenipotentiaries that a temporary\r\nsuspension of the act of the last session prohibiting certain\r\nimportations would, as a mark of candid disposition on our part and of\r\nconfidence in the temper and views with which they have been met, have\r\na happy effect on its course. A step so friendly will afford further\r\nevidence that all our proceedings have flowed from views of justice and\r\nconciliation, and that we give them willingly that form which may best\r\nmeet corresponding dispositions.\r\n\r\nAdd to this that the same motives which produced the postponement of\r\nthe act till the 15th of November last are in favor of its further\r\nsuspension, and as we have reason to hope that it may soon yield to\r\narrangements of mutual consent and convenience, justice seems to require\r\nthat the same measure may be dealt out to the few cases which may fall\r\nwithin its short course as to all others preceding and following it.\r\nI can not, therefore, but recommend the suspension of this act for a\r\nreasonable time, on considerations of justice, amity, and the public\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 15, 1806,\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress a report of the surveyor of the public buildings,\r\nstating the progress made on them during the last season and what is\r\nproposed for the ensuing one.\r\n\r\nI took every measure within my power for carrying into effect the\r\nrequest of the House of Representatives of the 17th of April last\r\nto cause the south wing of the Capitol to be prepared for their\r\naccommodation by the commencement of the present session. With great\r\nregret I found it was not to be accomplished. The quantity of freestone\r\nnecessary, with the size and quality of many of the blocks, was\r\nrepresented as beyond what could be obtained from the quarries by any\r\nexertions which could be commanded. The other parts of the work, which\r\nmight all have been completed in time, were necessarily retarded by the\r\ninsufficient progress of the stonework.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 5, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to each House of Congress a copy of the laws of the Territory\r\nof Michigan passed by the governor and judges of the Territory during\r\nthe year 1805.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 22, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAgreeably to the request of the House of Representatives communicated\r\nin their resolution of the 16th instant, I proceed to state, under the\r\nreserve therein expressed, information received touching an illegal\r\ncombination of private individuals against the peace and safety of the\r\nUnion, and a military expedition planned by them against the territories\r\nof a power in amity with the United States, with the measures I have\r\npursued for suppressing the same.\r\n\r\nI had for some time been in the constant expectation of receiving\r\nsuch further information as would have enabled me to lay before the\r\nLegislature the termination as well as the beginning and progress of\r\nthis scene of depravity so far as it has been acted on the Ohio and its\r\nwaters. From this the state of safety of the lower country might have\r\nbeen estimated on probable grounds, and the delay was indulged the\r\nrather because no circumstance had yet made it necessary to call in the\r\naid of the legislative functions. Information now recently communicated\r\nhas brought us nearly to the period contemplated. The mass of what I\r\nhave received in the course of these transactions is voluminous, but\r\nlittle has been given under the sanction of an oath so as to constitute\r\nformal and legal evidence. It is chiefly in the form of letters, often\r\ncontaining such a mixture of rumors, conjectures, and suspicions\r\nas renders it difficult to sift out the real facts and unadvisable\r\nto hazard more than general outlines, strengthened by concurrent\r\ninformation or the particular credibility of the relator. In this state\r\nof the evidence, delivered sometimes, too, under the restriction of\r\nprivate confidence, neither safety nor justice will permit the exposing\r\nnames, except that of the principal actor, whose guilt is placed beyond\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nSome time in the latter part of September I received intimations that\r\ndesigns were in agitation in the Western country unlawful and unfriendly\r\nto the peace of the Union, and that the prime mover in these was Aaron\r\nBurr, heretofore distinguished by the favor of his country. The grounds\r\nof these intimations being inconclusive, the objects uncertain, and the\r\nfidelity of that country known to be firm, the only measure taken was to\r\nurge the informants to use their best endeavors to get further insight\r\ninto the designs and proceedings of the suspected persons and to\r\ncommunicate them to me.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the latter part of October that the objects of the\r\nconspiracy began to be perceived, but still so blended and involved in\r\nmystery that nothing distinct could be singled out for pursuit. In this\r\nstate of uncertainty as to the crime contemplated, the acts done, and\r\nthe legal course to be pursued, I thought it best to send to the scene\r\nwhere these things were principally in transaction a person in whose\r\nintegrity, understanding, and discretion entire confidence could be\r\nreposed, with instructions to investigate the plots going on, to enter\r\ninto conference (for which he had sufficient credentials) with the\r\ngovernors and all other officers, civil and military, and with their\r\naid to do on the spot whatever should be necessary to discover the\r\ndesigns of the conspirators, arrest their means, bring their persons\r\nto punishment, and to call out the force of the country to suppress any\r\nunlawful enterprise in which it should be found they were engaged.\r\nBy this time it was known that many boats were under preparation,\r\nstores of provisions collecting, and an unusual number of suspicious\r\ncharacters in motion on the Ohio and its waters. Besides dispatching\r\nthe confidential agent to that quarter, orders were at the same time\r\nsent to the governors of the Orleans and Mississippi Territories and\r\nto the commanders of the land and naval forces there to be on their\r\nguard against surprise and in constant readiness to resist any enterprise\r\nwhich might be attempted on the vessels, posts, or other objects under\r\ntheir care; and on the 8th of November instructions were forwarded to\r\nGeneral Wilkinson to hasten an accommodation with the Spanish commandant\r\non the Sabine, and as soon as that was effected to fall back with his\r\nprincipal force to the hither bank of the Mississippi for the defense\r\nof the interesting points on that river. By a letter received from\r\nthat officer on the 25th of November, but dated October 21, we learnt\r\nthat a confidential agent of Aaron Burr had been deputed to him with\r\ncommunications, partly written in cipher and partly oral, explaining his\r\ndesigns, exaggerating his resources, and making such offers of emolument\r\nand command to engage him and the army in his unlawful enterprise as he\r\nhad flattered himself would be successful. The General, with the honor\r\nof a soldier and fidelity of a good citizen, immediately dispatched a\r\ntrusty officer to me with information of what had passed, proceeding\r\nto establish such an understanding with the Spanish commandant on the\r\nSabine as permitted him to withdraw his force across the Mississippi\r\nand to enter on measures for opposing the projected enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe General's letter, which came to hand on the 25th of November, as has\r\nbeen mentioned, and some other information received a few days earlier,\r\nwhen brought together developed Burr's general designs, different parts\r\nof which only had been revealed to different informants. It appeared\r\nthat he contemplated two distinct objects, which might be carried on\r\neither jointly or separately, and either the one or the other first,\r\nas circumstances should direct. One of these was the severance of the\r\nUnion of these States by the Alleghany Mountains; the other an attack\r\non Mexico. A third object was provided, merely ostensible, to wit, the\r\nsettlement of a pretended purchase of a tract of country on the Washita\r\nclaimed by a Baron Bastrop. This was to serve as the pretext for all\r\nhis preparations, an allurement for such followers as really wished to\r\nacquire settlements in that country and a cover under which to retreat\r\nin the event of a final discomfiture of both branches of his real\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\nHe found at once that the attachment of the Western country to the\r\npresent Union was not to be shaken; that its dissolution could not be\r\neffected with the consent of its inhabitants, and that his resources\r\nwere inadequate as yet to effect it by force. He took his course then\r\nat once, determined to seize on New Orleans, plunder the bank there,\r\npossess himself of the military and naval stores, and proceed on his\r\nexpedition to Mexico, and to this object all his means and preparations\r\nwere now directed. He collected from all the quarters where himself or\r\nhis agents possessed influence all the ardent, restless, desperate,\r\nand disaffected persons who were ready for any enterprise analogous to\r\ntheir characters. He seduced good and well-meaning citizens, some by\r\nassurances that he possessed the confidence of the Government and was\r\nacting under its secret patronage, a pretense which procured some credit\r\nfrom the state of our differences with Spain, and others by offers of\r\nland in Bastrop's claim on the Washita.\r\n\r\nThis was the state of my information of his proceedings about the last\r\nof November, at which time, therefore, it was first possible to take\r\nspecific measures to meet them. The proclamation of November 27, two\r\ndays after the receipt of General Wilkinson's information, was now\r\nissued. Orders were dispatched to every interesting point on the Ohio\r\nand Mississippi from Pittsburg to New Orleans for the employment of such\r\nforce either of the regulars or of the militia and of such proceedings\r\nalso of the civil authorities as might enable them to seize on all the\r\nboats and stores provided for the enterprise, to arrest the persons\r\nconcerned, and to suppress effectually the further progress of the\r\nenterprise. A little before the receipt of these orders in the State\r\nof Ohio our confidential agent, who had been diligently employed in\r\ninvestigating the conspiracy, had acquired sufficient information to\r\nopen himself to the governor of that State and apply for the immediate\r\nexertion of the authority and power of the State to crush the\r\ncombination. Governor Tiffin and the legislature, with a promptitude,\r\nan energy, and patriotic zeal which entitle them to a distinguished\r\nplace in the affection of their sister States, effected the seizure\r\nof all the boats, provisions, and other preparations within their\r\nreach, and thus gave a first blow, materially disabling the enterprise\r\nin its outset.\r\n\r\nIn Kentucky a premature attempt to bring Burr to justice without\r\nsufficient evidence for his conviction had produced a popular impression\r\nin his favor and a general disbelief of his guilt. This gave him an\r\nunfortunate opportunity of hastening his equipments. The arrival of\r\nthe proclamation and orders and the application and information of our\r\nconfidential agent at length awakened the authorities of that State\r\nto the truth, and then produced the same promptitude and energy of\r\nwhich the neighboring State had set the example. Under an act of their\r\nlegislature of December 23 militia was instantly ordered to different\r\nimportant points, and measures taken for doing whatever could yet be\r\ndone. Some boats (accounts vary from five to double or treble that\r\nnumber) and persons (differently estimated from 100 to 300) had in\r\nthe meantime passed the Falls of Ohio to rendezvous at the mouth of\r\nCumberland with others expected down that river.\r\n\r\nNot apprised till very late that any boats were building on Cumberland,\r\nthe effect of the proclamation had been trusted to for some time in the\r\nState of Tennessee; but on the *19th of December similar communications\r\nand instructions with those to the neighboring States were dispatched by\r\nexpress to the governor and a general officer of the western division\r\nofthe State, and on the 23d of December our confidential agent left\r\nFrankfort for Nashville to put into activity the means of that State\r\nalso. But by information received yesterday I learn that on the 22d of\r\nDecember Mr. Burr descended the Cumberland with two boats merely of\r\naccommodation, carrying with him from that State no quota toward his\r\nunlawful enterprise. Whether after the arrival of the proclamation, of\r\nthe orders, or of our agent any exertion which could be made by that\r\nState or the orders of the governor of Kentucky for calling out the\r\nmilitia at the mouth of Cumberland would be in time to arrest these\r\nboats and those from the Falls of Ohio is still doubtful.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the fugitives from the Ohio, with their associates from\r\nCumberland or any other place in that quarter, can not threaten serious\r\ndanger to the city of New Orleans.\r\n\r\nBy the same express of December 19 orders were sent to the governors of\r\nOrleans and Mississippi, supplementary to those which had been given\r\nonthe 25th of November, to hold the militia of their Territories in\r\nreadiness to cooperate for their defense with the regular troops and\r\narmed vessels then under command of General Wilkinson. Great alarm,\r\nindeed, was excited at New Orleans by the exaggerated accounts of Mr.\r\nBurr, disseminated through his emissaries, of the armies and navies\r\nhe was to assemble there. General Wilkinson had arrived there himself\r\non the 24th of November, and had immediately put into activity the\r\nresources of the place for the purpose of its defense, and on the 10th\r\nof December he was joined by his troops from the Sabine. Great zeal was\r\nshewn by the inhabitants generally, the merchants of the place readily\r\nagreeing to the most laudable exertions and sacrifices for manning the\r\narmed vessels with their seamen, and the other citizens manifesting\r\nunequivocal fidelity to the Union and a spirit of determined resistance\r\nto their expected assailants.\r\n\r\nSurmises have been hazarded that this enterprise is to receive aid\r\nfrom certain foreign powers; but these surmises are without proof or\r\nprobability. The wisdom of the measures sanctioned by Congress at its\r\nlast session has placed us in the paths of peace and justice with the\r\nonly powers with whom we had any differences, and nothing has happened\r\nsince which makes it either their interest or ours to pursue another\r\ncourse. No change of measures has taken place on our part; none ought\r\nto take place at this time. With the one, friendly arrangement was then\r\nproposed, and the law deemed necessary on the failure of that was\r\nsuspended to give time for a fair trial of the issue. With the same\r\npower friendly arrangement is now proceeding under good expectations,\r\nand the same law deemed necessary on failure of that is still suspended,\r\nto give time for a fair trial of the issue. With the other, negotiation\r\nwas in like manner then preferred, and provisional measures only taken\r\nto meet the event of rupture. With the same power negotiation is still\r\npreferred, and provisional measures only are necessary to meet the event\r\nof rupture. While, therefore, we do not deflect in the slightest degree\r\nfrom the course we then assumed and are still pursuing with mutual\r\nconsent to restore a good understanding, we arc not to impute to them\r\npractices as irreconcilable to interest as to good faith, and changing\r\nnecessarily the relations of peace and justice between us to those of\r\nwar. These surmises are therefore to be imputed to the vauntings of the\r\nauthor of this enterprise to multiply his partisans by magnifying the\r\nbelief of his prospects and support.\r\n\r\nBy letters from General Wilkinson of the 14th and 18th of December,\r\nwhich came to hand two days after the date of the resolution of the\r\nHouse of Representatives--that is to say, on the morning of the 18th\r\ninstant--I received the important affidavit a copy of which I now\r\ncommunicate, with extracts of so much of the letters as comes within the\r\nscope of the resolution. By these it will be seen that of three of the\r\nprincipal emissaries of Mr. Burr whom the General had caused to be\r\napprehended, one had been liberated by habeas corpus, and two others,\r\nbeing those particularly employed in the endeavor to corrupt the general\r\nand army of the United States, have been embarked by him for ports in\r\nthe Atlantic States, probably on the consideration that an impartial\r\ntrial could not be expected during the present agitations of New\r\nOrleans, and that that city was not as yet a safe place of confinement.\r\nAs soon as these persons shall arrive they will be delivered to the\r\ncustody of the law and left to such course of trial, both as to place\r\nand process, as its functionaries may direct. The presence of the\r\nhighest judicial authorities, to be assembled at this place within a few\r\ndays, the means of pursuing a sounder course of proceedings here than\r\nelsewhere, and the aid of the Executive means, should the judges have\r\noccasion to use them, render it equally desirable for the criminals as\r\nfor the public that, being already removed from the place where they\r\nwere first apprehended, the first regular arrest should take place here,\r\nand the course of proceedings receive here its proper direction.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 26, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate, and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI received from General Wilkinson on the 23d instant his affidavit\r\ncharging Samuel Swartwout, Peter V. Ogden, and James Alexander with the\r\ncrimes described in the affidavit a copy of which is now communicated\r\nto both Houses of Congress.\r\n\r\nIt was announced to me at the same time that Swartwout and Bollman, two\r\nof the persons apprehended by him, were arrived in this city in custody\r\neach of a military officer. I immediately delivered to the attorney of\r\nthe United States in this district the evidence received against them,\r\nwith instructions to lay the same before the judges and apply for their\r\nprocess to bring the accused to justice, and put into his hands orders\r\nto the officers having them in custody to deliver them to the marshal\r\non his application.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 27, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now render to Congress the account of the fund established for\r\ndefraying the contingent expenses of Government for the year 1806.\r\nNo occasion having arisen for making use of any part of the balance of\r\n$18,012.50, unexpended on the 31st day of December, 1805, that balance\r\nremains in the Treasury.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 28, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nBy the letters of Captain Bissel, who commands at Fort Massac, and of\r\nMr. Murrell, to General Jackson, of Tennessee, copies of which are now\r\ncommunicated to Congress, it will be seen that Aaron Burr passed Fort\r\nMassac on the 31st December with about ten boats, navigated by about six\r\nhands each, without any military appearance, and that three boats with\r\nammunition were said to have been arrested by the militia at Louisville.\r\n\r\nAs the guards of militia posted on various points of the Ohio will be\r\nable to prevent any further aids passing through that channel, should\r\nany be attempted, we may now estimate with tolerable certainty the means\r\nderived from the Ohio and its waters toward the accomplishment of the\r\npurposes of Mr. Burr.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 31, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn execution of the act of the last session of Congress entitled \"An\r\nact to regulate the laying out and making a road from Cumberland, in\r\nthe State of Maryland, to the State of Ohio,\" I appointed Thomas Moore,\r\nof Maryland; Joseph Kerr, of Ohio, and Eli Williams, of Maryland,\r\ncommissioners to lay out the said road, and to perform the other duties\r\nassigned to them by the act. The progress which they made in the\r\nexecution of the work during the last season will appear in their report\r\nnow communicated to Congress. On the receipt of it I took measures\r\nto obtain consent for making the road of the States of Pennsylvania,\r\nMaryland, and Virginia, through which the commissioners proposed to\r\nlay it out. I have received acts of the legislatures of Maryland and\r\nVirginia giving the consent desired; that of Pennsylvania has the\r\nsubject still under consideration, as is supposed. Until I receive full\r\nconsent to a free choice of route through the whole distance I have\r\nthought it safest neither to accept nor reject finally the partial\r\nreport of the commissioners. Some matters suggested in the report belong\r\nexclusively to the Legislature.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 6, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress the laws for the government of Louisiana, passed\r\nby the governor and judges of the Indiana Territory at their session at\r\nVincennes begun on the 1st of October, 1804.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 6, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe Government of France having examined into the claim of M. de\r\nBeaumarchais against the United States, and considering it as just and\r\nlegal, has instructed its minister here to make representations on the\r\nsubject to the Government of the United States. I now lay his memoir\r\nthereon before the Legislature, the only authority competent to a final\r\ndecision on the same.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 10, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate, for the information of Congress, a letter from Cowles\r\nMead, secretary of the Mississippi Territory, to the Secretary of War,\r\nby which it will be seen that Mr. Burr had reached that neighborhood\r\non the 13th of January.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 10, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the request of the House of Representatives expressed\r\nin their resolution of the 5th instant, I proceed to give such\r\ninformation as is possessed of the effect of gunboats in the protection\r\nand defense of harbors, of the numbers thought necessary, and of the\r\nproposed distribution of them among the ports and harbors of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nUnder present circumstances, and governed by the intentions of the\r\nLegislature as manifested by their annual appropriations of money for\r\nthe purposes of defense, it has been concluded to combine, first, land\r\nbatteries furnished with heavy cannon and mortars, and established on\r\nall the points around the place favorable for preventing vessels from\r\nlying before it; second, movable artillery, which may be carried, as\r\noccasion may require, to points unprovided with fixed batteries; third,\r\nfloating batteries, and fourth, gunboats which may oppose an enemy at\r\nhis entrance and cooperate with the batteries for his expulsion.\r\n\r\nOn this subject professional men were consulted as far as we had\r\nopportunity. General Wilkinson and the late General Gates gave their\r\nopinions in writing in favor of the system, as will be seen by their\r\nletters now communicated. The higher officers of the Navy gave the same\r\nopinions in separate conferences, as their presence at the seat of\r\nGovernment offered occasions of consulting them, and no difference of\r\njudgment appeared on the subject. Those of Commodore Barren and Captain\r\nTingey, now here, are recently furnished in writing, and transmitted\r\nherewith to the Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe efficacy of gunboats for the defense of harbors and of other smooth\r\nand inclosed waters may be estimated in part from that of galleys\r\nformerly much used but less powerful, more costly in their construction\r\nand maintenance, and requiring more men. But the gunboat itself is\r\nbelieved to be in use with every modern maritime nation for the purposes\r\nof defense. In the Mediterranean, on which are several small powers\r\nwhose system, like ours, is peace and defense, few harbors are without\r\nthis article of protection. Our own experience there of the effect of\r\ngunboats for harbor service is recent. Algiers is particularly known\r\nto have owed to a great provision of these vessels the safety of its\r\ncity since the epoch of their construction, Before that it had been\r\nrepeatedly insulted and injured. The effect of gunboats at present in\r\nthe neighborhood of Gibraltar is well known, and how much they were used\r\nboth in the attack and defense of that place during a former war. The\r\nextensive resort to them by the two greatest naval powers in the world\r\non an enterprise of invasion not long since in prospect shews their\r\nconfidence in their efficacy for the purposes for which they are suited.\r\nBy the northern powers of Europe, whose seas are particularly adapted\r\nto them, they are still more used. The remarkable action between the\r\nRussian flotilla of gunboats and galleys and a Turkish fleet of ships\r\nof the line and frigates in the Liman Sea in 1788 will be readily\r\nrecollected. The latter, commanded by their most celebrated admiral,\r\nwere completely defeated, and several of their ships of the line\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nFrom the opinions given as to the number of gunboats necessary for some\r\nof the principal seaports, and from a view of all the towns and ports\r\nfrom Orleans to Maine, inclusive, entitled to protection in proportion\r\nto their situation and circumstances, it is concluded that to give them\r\na due measure of protection in times of war about 200 gunboats will be\r\nrequisite.\r\n\r\nAccording to first ideas the following would be their general\r\ndistribution, liable to be varied on more mature examination and\r\nas circumstances shall vary; that is to say:\r\n\r\nTo the Mississippi and its neighboring waters, 40 gunboats.\r\n\r\nTo Savannah and Charleston, and the harbors on each side from St. Marys\r\nto Currituck, 25.\r\n\r\nTo the Chesapeake and its waters, 20.\r\n\r\nTo Delaware Bay and River, 15.\r\n\r\nTo New York, the Sound, and waters as far as Cape Cod, 50.\r\n\r\nTo Boston and the harbors north of Cape Cod, 50.\r\n\r\nThe flotillas assigned to these several stations might each be under\r\nthe care of a particular commandant, and the vessels composing them\r\nwould in ordinary be distributed among the harbors within the station\r\nin proportion to their importance.\r\n\r\nOf these boats a proper proportion would be of the larger size, such\r\nas those heretofore built, capable of navigating any seas and of\r\nreenforcing occasionally the strength of even the most distant ports\r\nwhen menaced with danger. The residue would be confined to their own\r\nor the neighboring harbors, would be smaller, less furnished for\r\naccommodation, and consequently less costly. Of the number supposed\r\nnecessary, 73 are built or building, and the 127 still to be provided\r\nwould cost from $500,000 to $600,000. Having regard to the convenience\r\nof the Treasury as well as to the resources for building, it has been\r\nthought that the one-half of these might be built in the present year\r\nand the other half the next. With the Legislature, however, it will rest\r\nto stop where we are, or at any further point, when they shall be of\r\nopinion that the number provided shall be sufficient for the object.\r\n\r\nAt times when Europe as well as the United States shall be at peace\r\nit would not be proposed that more than six or eight of these vessels\r\nshould be kept afloat. When Europe is in war, treble that number might\r\nbe necessary, to be distributed among those particular harbors which\r\nforeign vessels of war are in the habit of frequenting for the purpose\r\nof preserving order therein. But they would be manned in ordinary, with\r\nonly their complement for navigation, relying on the seamen and militia\r\nof the port if called into action on any sudden emergency. It would be\r\nonly when the United States should themselves be at war that the whole\r\nnumber would be brought into active service, and would be ready in the\r\nfirst moments of the war to cooperate with the other means for covering\r\nat once the line of our seaports. At all times those unemployed would be\r\nwithdrawn into places not exposed to sudden enterprise, hauled up under\r\nsheds from the sun and weather, and kept in preservation with little\r\nexpense for repairs or maintenance.\r\n\r\nIt must be superfluous to observe that this species of naval armament\r\nis proposed merely for defensive operation; that it can have but little\r\neffect toward protecting our commerce in the open seas, even on our own\r\ncoast; and still less can it become an excitement to engage in offensive\r\nmaritime war, toward which it would furnish no means.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 11, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now lay before Congress a statement of the militia of the United\r\nStates according to the latest returns received by the Department\r\nof War. From two of the States no returns have ever been received.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 19, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a letter from our ministers plenipotentiary\r\nat London, informing us that they have agreed with the British\r\ncommissioners to conclude a treaty on all the points which had formed\r\nthe object of their negotiation, and on terms which they trusted we\r\nwould approve.\r\n\r\nAlso a letter from our minister plenipotentiary at Paris covering one\r\nto him from the minister of marine of that Government assuring him that\r\nthe imperial decree lately passed was not to affect our commerce, which\r\nwould still be governed by the rules of the treaty established between\r\nthe two countries.\r\n\r\nAlso a letter from Cowles Mead, secretary of the Mississippi Territory,\r\nacting as governor, informing us that Aaron Burr had surrendered himself\r\nto the civil authority of that Territory.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS JEFFERSON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nDuring the wars which for some time have unhappily prevailed among the\r\npowers of Europe the United States of America, firm in their principles\r\nof peace, have endeavored, by justice, by a regular discharge of all\r\ntheir national and social duties, and by every friendly office their\r\nsituation has admitted, to maintain with all the belligerents their\r\naccustomed relations of friendship, hospitality, and commercial\r\nintercourse. Taking no part in the questions which animate these powers\r\nagainst each other, nor permitting themselves to entertain a wish but\r\nfor the restoration of general peace, they have observed with good faith\r\nthe neutrality they assumed, and they believe that no instance of a\r\ndeparture from its duties can be justly imputed to them by any nation.\r\nA free use of their harbors and waters, the means of refitting and of\r\nrefreshment, of succor to their sick and suffering, have at all times\r\nand on equal principles been extended to all, and this, too, amidst a\r\nconstant recurrence of acts of insubordination to the laws, of violence\r\nto the persons, and of trespasses on the property of our citizens\r\ncommitted by officers of one of the belligerent parties received among\r\nus. In truth, these abuses of the laws of hospitality have, with few\r\nexceptions, become habitual to the commanders of the British armed\r\nvessels hovering on our coasts and frequenting our harbors. They have\r\nbeen the subject of repeated representations to their Government.\r\nAssurances have been given that proper orders should restrain them\r\nwithin the limits of the rights and of the respect due to a friendly\r\nnation; but those orders and assurances have been without effect--no\r\ninstance of punishment for past wrongs has taken place. At length a deed\r\ntranscending all we have hitherto seen or suffered brings the public\r\nsensibility to a serious crisis and our forbearance to a necessary\r\npause. A frigate of the United States, trusting to a state of peace, and\r\nleaving her harbor on a distant service, has been surprised and attacked\r\nby a British vessel of superior force--one of a squadron then lying in\r\nour waters and covering the transaction--and has been disabled from\r\nservice, with the loss of a number of men killed and wounded. This\r\nenormity was not only without provocation or justifiable cause, but was\r\ncommitted with the avowed purpose of taking by force from a ship of war\r\nof the United States a part of her crew; and that no circumstance might\r\nbe wanting to mark its character, it had been previously ascertained\r\nthat the seamen demanded were native citizens of the United States.\r\nHaving effected her purpose, she returned to anchor with her squadron\r\nwithin our jurisdiction. Hospitality under such circumstances ceases to\r\nbe a duty, and a continuance of it with such uncontrolled abuses would\r\ntend only, by multiplying injuries and irritations, to bring on a\r\nrupture between the two nations. This extreme resort is equally opposed\r\nto the interests of both, as it is to assurances of the most friendly\r\ndispositions on the part of the British Government, in the midst of\r\nwhich this outrage has been committed. In this light the subject can not\r\nbut present itself to that Government and strengthen the motives to\r\nan honorable reparation of the wrong which has been done, and to that\r\neffectual control of its naval commanders which alone can justify the\r\nGovernment of the United States in the exercise of those hospitalities\r\nit is now constrained to discontinue.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of these circumstances and of the right of every nation\r\nto regulate its own police, to provide for its peace and for the safety\r\nof its citizens, and consequently to refuse the admission of armed\r\nvessels into its harbors or waters, either in such numbers or of such\r\ndescriptions as are inconsistent with these or with the maintenance\r\nof the authority of the laws, I have thought proper, in pursuance of\r\nthe authorities specially given by law, to issue this my proclamation,\r\nhereby requiring all armed vessels bearing commissions under the\r\nGovernment of Great Britain now within the harbors or waters of the\r\nUnited States immediately and without any delay to depart from the same,\r\nand interdicting the entrance of all the said harbors and waters to the\r\nsaid armed vessels and to all others bearing commissions under the\r\nauthority of the British Government.\r\n\r\nAnd if the said vessels, or any of them, shall fail to depart as\r\naforesaid, or if they or any others so interdicted shall hereafter\r\nenter the harbors or waters aforesaid, I do in that case forbid all\r\nintercourse with them, or any of them, their officers or crews, and\r\ndo prohibit all supplies and aid from being furnished to them, or any\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nAnd I do declare and make known that if any person from or within the\r\njurisdictional limits of the United States shall afford any aid to any\r\nsuch vessel contrary to the prohibition contained in this proclamation,\r\neither in repairing any such vessel or in furnishing her, her officers\r\nor crew, with supplies of any kind or in any manner whatsoever; or if\r\nany pilot shall assist in navigating any of the said armed vessels,\r\nunless it be for the purpose of carrying them in the first instance\r\nbeyond the limits and jurisdiction of the United States, or unless it\r\nbe in the case of a vessel forced by distress or charged with public\r\ndispatches, as hereinafter provided for, such person or persons shall\r\non conviction suffer all the pains and penalties by the laws provided\r\nfor such offenses.\r\n\r\nAnd I do hereby enjoin and require all persons bearing office, civil or\r\nmilitary, within or under the authority of the United States, and all\r\nothers citizens or inhabitants thereof, or being within the same, with\r\nvigilance and promptitude to exert their respective authorities and to\r\nbe aiding and assisting to the carrying this proclamation and every part\r\nthereof into full effect.\r\n\r\nProvided, nevertheless, that if any such vessel shall be forced into the\r\nharbors or waters of the United States by distress, by the dangers of\r\nthe sea, or by the pursuit of an enemy, or shall enter them charged\r\nwith dispatches or business from their Government, or shall be a public\r\npacket for the conveyance of letters and dispatches, the commanding\r\nofficer, immediately reporting his vessel to the collector of the\r\ndistrict, stating the object or causes of entering the said harbors\r\nor waters, and conforming himself to the regulations in that case\r\nprescribed under the authority of the laws, shall be allowed the benefit\r\nof such regulations respecting repairs, supplies, stay, intercourse, and\r\ndeparture as shall be permitted under the same authority.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be\r\naffixed to these presents, and signed the same.\r\n\r\nGiven at the city of Washington, the 2d day of July, A.D. 1807, and of\r\nthe Sovereignty and Independence of the United States the thirty-first.\r\n\r\nTH.

JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JAMES MADISON,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVENTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 27, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nCircumstances, fellow-citizens, which seriously threatened the peace\r\nof our country have made it a duty to convene you at an earlier period\r\nthan usual. The love of peace so much cherished in the bosoms of our\r\ncitizens, which has so long guided the proceedings of their public\r\ncouncils and induced forbearance under so many wrongs, may not insure\r\nour continuance in the quiet pursuits of industry. The many injuries\r\nand depredations committed on our commerce and navigation upon the high\r\nseas for years past, the successive innovations on those principles\r\nof public law which have been established by the reason and usage of\r\nnations as the rule of their intercourse and the umpire and security\r\nof their rights and peace, and all the circumstances which induced\r\nthe extraordinary mission to London are already known to you. The\r\ninstructions given to our ministers were framed in the sincerest spirit\r\nof amity and moderation. They accordingly proceeded, in conformity\r\ntherewith, to propose arrangements which might embrace and settle all\r\nthe points in difference between us, which might bring us to a mutual\r\nunderstanding on our neutral and national rights and provide for a\r\ncommercial intercourse on conditions of some equality. After long and\r\nfruitless endeavors to effect the purposes of their mission and to\r\nobtain arrangements within the limits of their instructions, they\r\nconcluded to sign such as could be obtained and to send them for\r\nconsideration, candidly declaring to the other negotiators at the same\r\ntime that they were acting against their instructions, and that their\r\nGovernment, therefore, could not be pledged for ratification. Some\r\nof the articles proposed might have been admitted on a principle\r\nof compromise, but others were too highly disadvantageous, and no\r\nsufficient provision was made against the principal source of the\r\nirritations and collisions which were constantly endangering the peace\r\nof the two nations. The question, therefore, whether a treaty should\r\nbe accepted in that form could have admitted but of one decision, even\r\nhad no declarations of the other party impaired our confidence in it.\r\nStill anxious not to close the door against friendly adjustment, new\r\nmodifications were framed and further concessions authorized than could\r\nbefore have been supposed necessary; and our ministers were instructed\r\nto resume their negotiations on these grounds. On this new reference to\r\namicable discussion we were reposing in confidence, when on the 22d day\r\nof June last by a formal order from a British admiral the frigate\r\n_Chesapeake_, leaving her port for a distant service, was attacked\r\nby one of those vessels which had been lying in our harbors under the\r\nindulgences of hospitality, was disabled from proceeding, had several\r\nof her crew killed and four taken away. On this outrage no commentaries\r\nare necessary. Its character has been pronounced by the indignant voice\r\nof our citizens with an emphasis and unanimity never exceeded. I\r\nimmediately, by proclamation, interdicted our harbors and waters to all\r\nBritish armed vessels, forbade intercourse with them, and uncertain how\r\nfar hostilities were intended, and the town of Norfolk, indeed, being\r\nthreatened with immediate attack, a sufficient force was ordered for\r\nthe protection of that place, and such other preparations commenced and\r\npursued as the prospect rendered proper. An armed vessel of the United\r\nStates was dispatched with instructions to our ministers at London to\r\ncall on that Government for the satisfaction and security required by\r\nthe outrage. A very short interval ought now to bring the answer, which\r\nshall be communicated to you as soon as received; then also, or as soon\r\nafter as the public interests shall be found to admit, the unratified\r\ntreaty and proceedings relative to it shall be made known to you.\r\n\r\nThe aggression thus begun has been continued on the part of the British\r\ncommanders by remaining within our waters in defiance of the authority\r\nof the country, by habitual violations of its jurisdiction, and at\r\nlength by putting to death one of the persons whom they had forcibly\r\ntaken from on board the _Chesapeake_. These aggravations necessarily\r\nlead to the policy either of never admitting an armed vessel into our\r\nharbors or of maintaining in every harbor such an armed force as may\r\nconstrain obedience to the laws and protect the lives and property\r\nof our citizens against their armed guests; but the expense of such\r\na standing force and its inconsistence with our principles dispense\r\nwith those courtesies which would necessarily call for it, and leave\r\nus equally free to exclude the navy, as we are the army, of a foreign\r\npower from entering our limits.\r\n\r\nTo former violations of maritime rights another is now added of very\r\nextensive effect. The Government of that nation has issued an order\r\ninterdicting all trade by neutrals between ports not in amity with\r\nthem; and being now at war with nearly every nation on the Atlantic and\r\nMediterranean seas, our vessels are required to sacrifice their cargoes\r\nat the first port they touch or to return home without the benefit of\r\ngoing to any other market. Under this new law of the ocean our trade\r\non the Mediterranean has been swept away by seizures and condemnations,\r\nand that in other seas is threatened with the same fate.\r\n\r\nOur differences with Spain remain still unsettled, no measure having\r\nbeen taken on her part since my last communications to Congress to\r\nbring them to a close. But under a state of things which may favor\r\nreconsideration they have been recently pressed, and an expectation is\r\nentertained that they may now soon be brought to an issue of some sort.\r\nWith their subjects on our borders no new collisions have taken place\r\nnor seem immediately to be apprehended. To our former grounds of\r\ncomplaint has been added a very serious one, as you will see by the\r\ndecree a copy of which is now communicated. Whether this decree, which\r\nprofesses to be conformable to that of the French Government of November\r\n21, 1806, heretofore communicated to Congress, will also be conformed\r\nto that in its construction and application in relation to the United\r\nStates had not been ascertained at the date of our last communications.\r\nThese, however, gave reason to expect such a conformity.\r\n\r\nWith the other nations of Europe our harmony has been uninterrupted,\r\nand commerce and friendly intercourse have been maintained on their\r\nusual footing.\r\n\r\nOur peace with the several states on the coast of Barbary appears as\r\nfirm as at any former period and as likely to continue as that of any\r\nother nation.\r\n\r\nAmong our Indian neighbors in the northwestern quarter some fermentation\r\nwas observed soon after the late occurrences, threatening the\r\ncontinuance of our peace. Messages were said to be interchanged and\r\ntokens to be passing, which usually denote a state of restlessness among\r\nthem, and the character of the agitators pointed to the sources of\r\nexcitement. Measures were immediately taken for providing against that\r\ndanger; instructions were given to require explanations, and, with\r\nassurances of our continued friendship, to admonish the tribes to remain\r\nquiet at home, taking no part in quarrels not belonging to them. As\r\nfar as we are yet informed, the tribes in our vicinity, who are most\r\nadvanced in the pursuits of industry, are sincerely disposed to adhere\r\nto their friendship with us and to their peace with all others, while\r\nthose more remote do not present appearances sufficiently quiet to\r\njustify the intermission of military precaution on our part.\r\n\r\nThe great tribes on our southwestern quarter, much advanced beyond\r\nthe others in agriculture and household arts, appear tranquil and\r\nidentifying their views with ours in proportion to their advancement.\r\nWith the whole of these people, in every quarter, I shall continue to\r\ninculcate peace and friendship with all their neighbors and perseverance\r\nin those occupations and pursuits which will best promote their own\r\nwell-being.\r\n\r\nThe appropriations of the last session for the defense of our seaport\r\ntowns and harbors were made under expectation that a continuance of\r\nour peace would permit us to proceed in that work according to our\r\nconvenience. It has been thought better to apply the sums then given\r\ntoward the defense of New York, Charleston, and New Orleans chiefly, as\r\nmost open and most likely first to need protection, and to leave places\r\nless immediately in danger to the provisions of the present session.\r\n\r\nThe gunboats, too, already provided have on a like principle been\r\nchiefly assigned to New York, New Orleans, and the Chesapeake. Whether\r\nour movable force on the water, so material in aid of the defensive\r\nworks on the land, should be augmented in this or any other form is\r\nleft to the wisdom of the Legislature. For the purpose of manning\r\nthese vessels in sudden attacks on our harbors it is a matter for\r\nconsideration whether the seamen of the United States may not justly\r\nbe formed into a special militia, to be called on for tours of duty\r\nin defense of the harbors where they shall happen to be, the ordinary\r\nmilitia of the place furnishing that portion which may consist of\r\nlandsmen.\r\n\r\nThe moment our peace was threatened I deemed it indispensable to secure\r\na greater provision of those articles of military stores with which our\r\nmagazines were not sufficiently furnished. To have awaited a previous\r\nand special sanction by law would have lost occasions which might not\r\nbe retrieved. I did not hesitate, therefore, to authorize engagements\r\nfor such supplements to our existing stock as would render it adequate\r\nto the emergencies threatening us, and I trust that the Legislature,\r\nfeeling the same anxiety for the safety of our country, so materially\r\nadvanced by this precaution, will approve, when done, what they would\r\nhave seen so important to be done if then assembled. Expenses, also\r\nunprovided for, arose out of the necessity of calling all our gunboats\r\ninto actual service for the defense of our harbors; of all which\r\naccounts will be laid before you.\r\n\r\nWhether a regular army is to be raised, and to what extent, must depend\r\non the information so shortly expected. In the meantime I have called\r\non the States for quotas of militia, to be in readiness for present\r\ndefense, and have, moreover, encouraged the acceptance of volunteers;\r\nand I am happy to inform you that these have offered themselves with\r\ngreat alacrity in every part of the Union. They are ordered to be\r\norganized and ready at a moment's warning to proceed on any service to\r\nwhich they may be called, and every preparation within the Executive\r\npowers has been made to insure us the benefit of early exertions.\r\n\r\nI informed Congress at their last session of the enterprises against the\r\npublic peace which were believed to be in preparation by Aaron Burr and\r\nhis associates, of the measures taken to defeat them and to bring the\r\noffenders to justice. Their enterprises were happily defeated by the\r\npatriotic exertions of the militia whenever called into action, by the\r\nfidelity of the Army, and energy of the commander in chief in promptly\r\narranging the difficulties presenting themselves on the Sabine,\r\nrepairing to meet those arising on the Mississippi, and dissipating\r\nbefore their explosion plots engendering there. I shall think it my duty\r\nto lay before you the proceedings and the evidence publicly exhibited on\r\nthe arraignment of the principal offenders before the circuit court of\r\nVirginia. You will be enabled to judge whether the defect was in the\r\ntestimony, in the law, or in the administration of the law; and wherever\r\nit shall be found, the Legislature alone can apply or originate the\r\nremedy. The framers of our Constitution certainly supposed they had\r\nguarded as well their Government against destruction by treason as their\r\ncitizens against oppression under pretense of it, and if these ends are\r\nnot attained it is of importance to inquire by what means more effectual\r\nthey may be secured.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the receipts of revenue during the year ending on the\r\n30th day of September last being not yet made up, a correct statement\r\nwill be hereafter transmitted from the Treasury. In the meantime, it is\r\nascertained that the receipts have amounted to near $16,000,000, which,\r\nwith the five millions and a half in the Treasury at the beginning\r\nof the year, have enabled us, after meeting the current demands and\r\ninterest incurred, to pay more than four millions of the principal of\r\nour funded debt. These payments, with those of the preceding five and a\r\nhalf years, have extinguished of the funded debt $25,500,000, being the\r\nwhole which could be paid or purchased within the limits of the law and\r\nof our contracts, and have left us in the Treasury $8,500,000. A portion\r\nof this sum may be considered as a commencement of accumulation of the\r\nsurpluses of revenue which, after paying the installments of debt as\r\nthey shall become payable, will remain without any specific object. It\r\nmay partly, indeed, be applied toward completing the defense of the\r\nexposed points of our country, on such a scale as shall be adapted to\r\nour principles and circumstances. This object is doubtless among the\r\nfirst entitled to attention in such a state of our finances, and it is\r\none which, whether we have peace or war, will provide security where it\r\nis due. Whether what shall remain of this, with the future surpluses,\r\nmay be usefully applied to purposes already authorized or more usefully\r\nto others requiring new authorities, or how otherwise they shall be\r\ndisposed of, are questions calling for the notice of Congress, unless,\r\nindeed, they shall be superseded by a change in our public relations now\r\nawaiting the determination of others. Whatever be that determination, it\r\nis a great consolation that it will become known at a moment when the\r\nsupreme council of the nation is assembled at its post, and ready to\r\ngive the aids of its wisdom and authority to whatever course the good\r\nof our country shall then call us to pursue.\r\n\r\nMatters of minor importance will be the subjects of future\r\ncommunications, and nothing shall be wanting on my part which may give\r\ninformation or dispatch to the proceedings of the Legislature in the\r\nexercise of their high duties, and at a moment so interesting to the\r\npublic welfare.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 11, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nSome time had elapsed after the receipt of the late treaty between\r\nthe United States and Tripoli before the circumstance drew particular\r\nattention that, although by the third article the wife and children of\r\nthe ex-Bashaw were to be restored to him, this did not appear either\r\nto have been done or demanded; still, it was constantly expected that\r\nexplanations on the subject would be received. None, however, having\r\narrived when Mr. Davis went as consul to Tripoli, he was instructed to\r\ndemand the execution of the article. He did so, but was answered by the\r\nexhibition of a declaration, signed by our negotiator the day after the\r\nsignature of the treaty, allowing four years for the restoration of the\r\nfamily. This declaration and the letter of Mr. Davis stating what passed\r\non the occasion are now communicated to the Senate. On the receipt of\r\nthis letter I caused the correspondence of Mr. Lear to be diligently\r\nreexamined in order to ascertain whether there might have been a\r\ncommunication of this paper made and overlooked or forgotten. None such,\r\nhowever, is found. There appears only in a journalized account of the\r\ntransaction by Mr. Lear, under date of June 3, a passage intimating that\r\nhe should be disposed to give time rather than suffer the business to be\r\nbroken off and our countrymen left in slavery; and again, that on the\r\nreturn of the person who passed between himself and the Bashaw, and\r\ninformation that the Bashaw would require time for the delivery of the\r\nfamily, he consented, and went ashore to consummate the treaty. This was\r\ndone the next day, and being forwarded to us as ultimately signed, and\r\nfound to contain no allowance of time nor any intimation that there was\r\nany stipulation but what was in the public treaty, it was supposed that\r\nthe Bashaw had, in fine, abandoned the proposition, and the instructions\r\nbefore mentioned were consequently given to Mr. Davis.\r\n\r\nAn extract of so much of Mr. Lear's communication as relates to this\r\ncircumstance is now transmitted to the Senate, the whole of the papers\r\nhaving been laid before them on a former occasion. How it has happened\r\nthat the declaration of June 5 has never before come to our knowledge\r\ncan not with certainty be said, but whether there has been a miscarriage\r\nof it or a failure of the ordinary attention and correctness of that\r\nofficer in making his communications, I have thought it due to the\r\nSenate as well as to myself to explain to them the circumstances\r\nwhich have withheld from their knowledge, as they did from my own,\r\na modification which, had it been placed in the public treaty, would\r\nhave been relieved from the objections which candor and good faith can\r\nnot but feel in its present form.\r\n\r\nAs the restoration of the family has probably been effected, a just\r\nregard to the character of the United States will require that I make\r\nto the Bashaw a candid statement of facts, and that the sacrifices of\r\nhis right to the peace and friendship of the two countries, by yielding\r\nfinally to the demand of Mr. Davis, be met by proper acknowledgments and\r\nreparation on our part.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 19, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAccording to the request expressed in your resolution of the 18th\r\ninstant, I now transmit a copy of my proclamation interdicting our\r\nharbors and waters to British armed vessels and forbidding intercourse\r\nwith them, referred to in my message of the 27th of October last.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 23, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAgreeably to the assurance given in my message at the opening of\r\nthe present session of Congress, I now lay before you a copy of the\r\nproceedings and of the evidence exhibited on the arraignment of Aaron\r\nBurr and others before the circuit court of the United States held in\r\nVirginia in the course of the present year, in as authentic form as\r\ntheir several parts have admitted.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 23, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nSome circumstance, which can not now be ascertained, induced a belief\r\nthat an act had passed at the last session of Congress for establishing\r\na surveyor and inspector of revenue for the port of Stonington, in\r\nConnecticut, and commissions were signed appointing Jonathan Palmer,\r\nof Connecticut, to those offices. The error was discovered at the\r\nTreasury, and the commissions were retained; but not having been\r\nnotified to me, I renewed the nomination in my message of the 9th\r\ninstant to the Senate. In order to correct the error, I have canceled\r\nthe temporary commissions, and now revoke the nomination which I made\r\nof the said Jonathan Palmer to the Senate.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 2, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the request made in the resolution of the Senate\r\nof November 30, I must inform them that when the prosecutions against\r\nAaron Burr and his associates were instituted I delivered to the\r\nAttorney-General all the evidence on the subject, formal and informal,\r\nwhich I had received, to be used by those employed in the prosecutions.\r\nOn the receipt of the resolution of the Senate I referred it to the\r\nAttorney-General, with a request that he would enable me to comply with\r\nit by putting into my hands such of the papers as might give information\r\nrelative to the conduct of John Smith, a Senator from the State of Ohio,\r\nas an alleged associate of Aaron Burr, and having this moment received\r\nfrom him the affidavit of Elias Glover, with an assurance that it is the\r\nonly paper in his possession which is within the term of the request of\r\nthe Senate, I now transmit it for their use.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 7, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nHaving recently received from our late minister plenipotentiary at\r\nthe Court of London a duplicate of dispatches, the original of which\r\nhas been sent by the _Revenge_ schooner, not yet arrived, I hasten\r\nto lay them before both Houses of Congress. They contain the whole\r\nof what has passed between the two Governments on the subject of\r\nthe outrage committed by the British ship _Leopard_ on the frigate\r\n_Chesapeake_. Congress will learn from these papers the present\r\nstate of the discussion on that transaction, and that it is to be\r\ntransferred to this place by the mission of a special minister.\r\n\r\nWhile this information will have its proper effect on their\r\ndeliberations and proceedings respecting the relations between the two\r\ncountries, they will be sensible that, the negotiation being still\r\ndepending, it is proper for me to request that the communications may\r\nbe considered as confidential.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 18, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe communications now made, shewing the great and increasing dangers\r\nwith which our vessels, our seamen, and merchandise are threatened\r\non the high seas and elsewhere from the belligerent powers of Europe,\r\nand it being of the greatest importance to keep in safety these\r\nessential resources, I deem it my duty to recommend the subject to\r\nthe consideration of Congress, who will doubtless perceive all the\r\nadvantages which may be expected from an inhibition of the departure\r\nof our vessels from the ports of the United States.\r\n\r\nTheir wisdom will also see the necessity of making every preparation\r\nfor whatever events may grow out of the present crisis.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 30, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress the inclosed letters from Governor Hull,\r\nrespecting the Indians in the vicinity of Detroit residing within our\r\nlines. They contain information of the state of things in that quarter\r\nwhich will properly enter into their view in estimating the means to\r\nbe provided for the defense of our country generally.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 8, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now render to Congress the account of the fund established for\r\ndefraying the contingent expenses of Government for the year 1807.\r\nOf the sum of $18,012.50, which remained unexpended at the close\r\nof the year 1806, $8,731.11 have been placed in the hands of the\r\nAttorney-General of the United States, to enable him to defray sundry\r\nexpenses incident to the prosecution of Aaron Burr and his accomplices\r\nfor treasons and misdemeanors alleged to have been committed by them,\r\nand the unexpended balance of $9,275.39 is now carried according to\r\nlaw to the credit of the surplus fund.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 15, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe posts of Detroit and Mackinac having been originally intended by the\r\nGovernments which established and held them as mere depots for commerce\r\nwith the Indians, very small cessions of land around them were obtained\r\nor asked from the native proprietors, and these posts depended for\r\nprotection on the strength of their garrisons. The principles of our\r\nGovernment leading us to the employment of such moderate garrisons in\r\ntime of peace as may merely take care of the post, and to a reliance on\r\nthe neighboring militia for its support in the first moments of war,\r\nI have thought it would be important to obtain from the Indians such a\r\ncession in the neighborhood of these posts as might maintain a militia\r\nproportioned to this object; and I have particularly contemplated, with\r\nthis view, the acquisition of the eastern moiety of the peninsula\r\nbetween lakes Michigan and Huron, comprehending the waters of the latter\r\nand of Detroit River, so soon as it could be effected with the perfect\r\ngood will of the natives. Governor Hull was therefore appointed a\r\ncommissioner to treat with them on this subject, but was instructed to\r\nconfine his propositions for the present to so much of the tract before\r\ndescribed as lay south of Saguina Bay and round to the Connecticut\r\nReserve, so as to consolidate the new with the present settled country.\r\nThe result has been an acquisition of so much only of what would have\r\nbeen acceptable as extends from the neighborhood of Saguina Bay to the\r\nMiami of the Lakes, with a prospect of soon obtaining a breadth of 2\r\nmiles for a communication from the Miami to the Connecticut Reserve.\r\nThe treaty for this purpose entered into with the Ottoways, Chippeways,\r\nWyandots, and Pottawattamies at Detroit on the 17th of November last is\r\nnow transmitted to the Senate, and I ask their advice and consent as to\r\nits ratification.\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith such papers as bear any material relation to\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 15, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAlthough it is deemed very desirable that the United States should\r\nobtain from the native proprietors the whole left bank of the\r\nMississippi to a certain breadth, yet to obliterate from the Indian\r\nmind an impression deeply made in it that we are constantly forming\r\ndesigns on their lands I have thought it best where urged by no\r\npeculiar necessity to leave to themselves and to the pressure of\r\ntheir own convenience only to come forward with offers of sale to\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe Choctaws, being indebted to certain mercantile characters beyond\r\nwhat could be discharged by the ordinary proceeds of their huntings, and\r\npressed for payment by those creditors, proposed at length to the United\r\nStates to cede lands to the amount of their debts, and designated them\r\nin two different portions of their country. These designations not at\r\nall suiting us, their proposals were declined for that reason, and with\r\nan intimation that if their own convenience should ever dispose them to\r\ncede their lands on the Mississippi we should be willing to purchase.\r\nStill urged by their creditors, as well as by their own desire to be\r\nliberated from debt, they at length proposed to make a cession which\r\nshould be to our convenience. James Robertson, of Tennessee, and Silas\r\nDinsmore were thereupon appointed commissioners to treat with them on\r\nthat subject, with instructions to purchase only on the Mississippi. On\r\nmeeting their chiefs, however, it was found that such was the attachment\r\nof the nation to their lands on the Mississippi that their chiefs could\r\nnot undertake to cede them; but they offered all their lands south of\r\na line to be run from their and our boundary at the Omochita eastwardly\r\nto their boundary with the Creeks, on the ridge between the Tombigbee\r\nand Alabama, which would unite our possessions there from Natchez\r\nto Tombigbee. A treaty to this effect was accordingly signed at\r\nPooshapekanuk on the 16th of November, 1805; but this being against\r\nexpress instructions, and not according with the object then in view,\r\nI was disinclined to its ratification, and therefore did not at the last\r\nsession of Congress lay it before the Senate for their advice, but have\r\nsuffered it to lie unacted on.\r\n\r\nProgressive difficulties, however, in our foreign relations have brought\r\ninto view considerations other than those which then prevailed. It is\r\nnow, perhaps, become as interesting to obtain footing for a strong\r\nsettlement of militia along our southern frontier eastward of the\r\nMississippi as on the west of that river, and more so than higher up\r\nthe river itself. The consolidation of the Mississippi Territory and\r\nthe establishing a barrier of separation between the Indians and our\r\nSouthern neighbors are also important objects. The cession is supposed\r\nto contain about 5,000,000 acres, of which the greater part is said to\r\nbe fit for cultivation, and no inconsiderable proportion of the first\r\nquality, on the various waters it includes; and the Choctaws and their\r\ncreditors are still anxious for the sale.\r\n\r\nI therefore now transmit the treaty for the consideration of the Senate,\r\nand I ask their advice and consent as to its ratification. I communicate\r\nat the same time such papers as bear any material relation to the\r\nsubject, together with a map on which is sketched the northern limit of\r\nthe cession, rather to give a general idea than with any pretension to\r\nexactness, which our present knowledge of the country would not warrant.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 20, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nSome days previous to your resolutions of the 13th instant a court of\r\ninquiry had been instituted at the request of General Wilkinson, charged\r\nto make the inquiry into his conduct which the first resolution desires,\r\nand had commenced their proceedings. To the judge-advocate of that court\r\nthe papers and information on that subject transmitted to me by the\r\nHouse of Representatives have been delivered, to be used according to\r\nthe rules and powers of that court.\r\n\r\nThe request of a communication of any information which may have been\r\nreceived at any time since the establishment of the present Government\r\ntouching combinations with foreign agents for dismembering the Union\r\nor the corrupt receipt of money by any officer of the United States\r\nfrom the agents of foreign governments can be complied with but in a\r\npartial degree.\r\n\r\nIt is well understood that in the first or second year of the Presidency\r\nof General Washington information was given to him relating to\r\ncertain combinations with the agents of a foreign government for the\r\ndismemberment of the Union, which combinations had taken place before\r\nthe establishment of the present Federal Government. This information,\r\nhowever, is believed never to have been deposited in any public office,\r\nor left in that of the President's secretary, these having been duly\r\nexamined, but to have been considered as personally confidential, and\r\ntherefore retained among his private papers. A communication from the\r\ngovernor of Virginia to President Washington is found in the office\r\nof the President's secretary, which, although not strictly within the\r\nterms of the request of the House of Representatives, is communicated,\r\ninasmuch as it may throw some light on the subjects of the\r\ncorrespondence of that time between certain foreign agents and citizens\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the first or second year of the Administration of President Adams\r\nAndrew Ellicott, then employed in designating, in conjunction with the\r\nSpanish authorities, the boundaries between the territories of the\r\nUnited States and Spain, under the treaty with that nation, communicated\r\nto the Executive of the United States papers and information respecting\r\nthe subjects of the present inquiry, which were deposited in the\r\nOffice of State. Copies of these are now transmitted to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, except of a single letter and a reference from the\r\nsaid Andrew Ellicott, which, being expressly desired to be kept secret,\r\nis therefore not communicated, but its contents can be obtained from\r\nhimself in a more legal form, and directions have been given to summon\r\nhim to appear as a witness before the court of inquiry.\r\n\r\nA paper on \"The Commerce of Louisiana,\" bearing date the 18th of\r\nApril, 1798, is found in the Office of State, supposed to have been\r\ncommunicated by Mr. Daniel Clark, of New Orleans, then a subject of\r\nSpain, and now of the House of Representatives of the United States,\r\nstating certain commercial transactions of General Wilkinson in New\r\nOrleans. An extract from this is now communicated, because it contains\r\nfacts which may have some bearing on the questions relating to him.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the War Office by fire in the close of 1800 involved\r\nall information it contained at that date.\r\n\r\nThe papers already described therefore constitute the whole of the\r\ninformation on the subjects deposited in the public offices during the\r\npreceding Administrations, as far as has yet been found; but it can\r\nnot be affirmed that there may be no other, because, the papers of the\r\noffice being filed for the most part alphabetically, unless aided by the\r\nsuggestion of any particular name which may have given such information,\r\nnothing short of a careful examination of the papers in the offices\r\ngenerally could authorize such an affirmation.\r\n\r\nAbout a twelvemonth after I came to the administration of the Government\r\nMr. Clark gave some verbal information to myself, as well as to the\r\nSecretary of State, relating to the same combinations for the\r\ndismemberment of the Union. He was listened to freely, and he then\r\ndelivered the letter of Governor Gayoso, addressed to himself, of which\r\na copy is now communicated. After his return to New Orleans he forwarded\r\nto the Secretary of State other papers, with a request that after\r\nperusal they should be burnt. This, however, was not done, and he was so\r\ninformed by the Secretary of State, and that they would be held subject\r\nto his orders. These papers have not yet been found in the office.\r\nA letter, therefore, has been addressed to the former chief clerk, who\r\nmay perhaps give information respecting them. As far as our memories\r\nenable us to say, they related only to the combinations before spoken\r\nof, and not at all to the corrupt receipt of money by any officer of\r\nthe United States; consequently they respected what was considered as\r\na dead matter, known to the preceding Administrations, and offering\r\nnothing new to call for investigations, which those nearest the dates\r\nof the transactions had not thought proper to institute.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the communications made to me on the subject of the\r\nconspiracy of Aaron Burr I sometimes received letters, some of them\r\nanonymous, some under names true or false, expressing suspicions and\r\ninsinuations against General Wilkinson; but one only of them, and that\r\nanonymous, specified any particular fact, and that fact was one of those\r\nwhich had been already communicated to a former Administration.\r\n\r\nNo other information within the purview of the request of the House is\r\nknown to have been received by any department of the Government from the\r\nestablishment of the present Federal Government. That which has been\r\nrecently communicated to the House of Representatives, and by them\r\nto me, is the first direct testimony ever made known to me charging\r\nGeneral Wilkinson with the corrupt receipt of money, and the House of\r\nRepresentatives may be assured that the duties which this information\r\ndevolves on me shall be exercised with rigorous impartiality. Should any\r\nwant of power in the court to compel the rendering of testimony obstruct\r\nthat full and impartial inquiry which alone can establish guilt or\r\ninnocence and satisfy justice, the legislative authority only will be\r\ncompetent to the remedy.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 30, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe Choctaws, being indebted to their merchants beyond what could be\r\ndischarged by the ordinary proceeds of their buntings, and pressed for\r\npayment, proposed to the United States to cede lands to the amount of\r\ntheir debts, and designated them in two different portions of their\r\ncountry. These designations, not at all suiting us, were declined. Still\r\nurged by their creditors, as well as by their own desire to be liberated\r\nfrom debt, they at length proposed to make a cession which should be to\r\nour convenience. By a treaty signed at Pooshapuckanuck on the 16th of\r\nNovember, 1805, they accordingly ceded all their lands south of a line\r\nto be run from their and our boundary at the Omochita eastwardly to\r\ntheir boundary with the Creeks, on the ridge between the Tombigbee and\r\nAlabama, as is more particularly described in the treaty, containing\r\nabout 5,000,000 acres, as is supposed, and uniting our possessions there\r\nfrom Adams to Washington County.\r\n\r\nThe location contemplated in the instructions to the commissioners was\r\non the Mississippi. That in the treaty being entirely different, I was\r\nat that time disinclined to its ratification, and I have suffered it to\r\nlie unacted on. But progressive difficulties in our foreign relations\r\nhave brought into view considerations other than those which then\r\nprevailed. It is now, perhaps, as interesting to obtain footing for a\r\nstrong settlement of militia along our southern frontier eastward of the\r\nMississippi as on the west of that river, and more so than higher up the\r\nriver itself. The consolidation of the Mississippi Territory and the\r\nestablishment of a barrier of separation between the Indians and our\r\nSouthern neighbors are also important objects; and the Choctaws and\r\ntheir creditors being still anxious that the sale should be made, I\r\nsubmitted the treaty to the Senate, who have advised and consented to\r\nits ratification. I therefore now lay it before both Houses of Congress\r\nfor the exercise of their constitutional powers as to the means of\r\nfulfilling it.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 30, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe posts of Detroit and Mackinac having been originally intended by the\r\nGovernments which established and held them as mere depots for commerce\r\nwith the Indians, very small cessions of land around them were obtained\r\nor asked from the native proprietors, and these posts depended for\r\nprotection on the strength of their garrisons. The principles of our\r\nGovernment leading us to the employment of such moderate garrisons in\r\ntime of peace as may merely take care of the post, and to a reliance on\r\nthe neighboring militia for its support in the first moments of war,\r\nI have thought it would be important to obtain from the Indians such a\r\ncession in the neighborhood of these posts as might maintain a militia\r\nproportioned to this object; and I have particularly contemplated,\r\nwith this view, the acquisition of the eastern moiety of the peninsula\r\nbetween the lakes Michigan, Huron, and Erie, extending it to the\r\nConnecticut Reserve so soon as it could be effected with the perfect\r\ngood will of the natives.\r\n\r\nBy a treaty concluded at Detroit on the 17th of November last with the\r\nOttoways, Chippeways, Wyandots, and Pattawatimas so much of this country\r\nhas been obtained as extends from about Saguina Bay southwardly to the\r\nMiami of the Lakes, supposed to contain upward of 5,000,000 acres, with\r\na prospect of obtaining for the present a breadth of 2 miles for a\r\ncommunication from the Miami to the Connecticut Reserve.\r\n\r\nThe Senate having advised and consented to the ratification of this\r\ntreaty, I now lay it before both Houses of Congress for the exercise\r\nof their constitutional powers as to the means of fulfilling it.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 2, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nHaving received an official communication of certain orders of the\r\nBritish Government against the maritime rights of neutrals, bearing date\r\nthe 11th of November, 1807, I transmit them to Congress, as a further\r\nproof of the increasing dangers to our navigation and commerce, which\r\nled to the provident measure of the act of the present session laying an\r\nembargo on our own vessels,\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 4, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn my message of January 20 I stated that some papers forwarded by Mr.\r\nDaniel Clark, of New Orleans, to the Secretary of State in 1803 had not\r\nthen been found in the Office of State, and that a letter had been\r\naddressed to the former chief clerk, in the hope that he might advise\r\nwhere they should be sought for. By indications received from him they\r\nare now found. Among them are two letters from the Baron de Carondelet\r\nto an officer serving under him at a separate post, in which his views\r\nof a dismemberment of our Union are expressed. Extracts of so much of\r\nthese letters as are within the scope of the resolution of the House are\r\nnow communicated. With these were found the letters written by Mr. Clark\r\nto the Secretary of State in 1803. A part of one only of these relates\r\nto this subject, and is extracted and inclosed for the information of\r\nthe House. In no part of the papers communicated by Mr. Clark, which are\r\nvoluminous and in different languages, nor in his letters, have we found\r\nany intimation of the corrupt receipt of money by any officer of the\r\nUnited States from any foreign agent. As to the combinations with\r\nforeign agents for dismembering the Union, these papers and letters\r\noffer nothing which was not probably known to my predecessors, or which\r\ncould call anew for inquiries, which they had not thought necessary to\r\ninstitute, when the facts were recent and could be better proved. They\r\nprobably believed it best to let pass into oblivion transactions which,\r\nhowever culpable, had commenced before this Government existed, and had\r\nbeen finally extinguished by the treaty of 1795.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 9, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress, for their information, a letter from the\r\nperson acting in the absence of our consul at Naples, giving reason\r\nto believe, on the affidavit of a Captain Sheffield, of the American\r\nschooner _Mary Ann_, that the Dey of Algiers has commenced war\r\nagainst the United States. For this no just cause has been given on\r\nour part within my knowledge. We may daily expect more authentic and\r\nparticular information on the subject from Mr. Lear, who was residing\r\nas our consul at Algiers.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 15, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate for the information of Congress a letter from the consul\r\nof the United States at Malaga to the Secretary of State, covering one\r\nfrom Mr. Lear, our consul at Algiers, which gives information that the\r\nrupture threatened on the part of the Dey of Algiers has been amicably\r\nsettled, and the vessels seized by him are liberated.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 19, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe States of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia having by their\r\nseveral acts consented that the road from Cumberland to the State of\r\nOhio, authorized by the act of Congress of the 29th of March, 1806,\r\nshould pass through those States, and the report of the commissioners,\r\ncommunicated to Congress with my message of the 31st January, 1807,\r\nhaving been duly considered, I have approved of the route therein\r\nproposed for the said road as far as Brownsville, with a single\r\ndeviation, since located, which carries it through Uniontown.\r\n\r\nFrom thence the course to the Ohio and the point within the legal limits\r\nat which it shall strike that river is still to be decided. In forming\r\nthis decision I shall pay material regard to the interests and wishes of\r\nthe populous parts of the State of Ohio and to a future and convenient\r\nconnection with the road which is to lead from the Indian boundary near\r\nCincinnati by Vincennes to the Mississippi at St. Louis, under authority\r\nof the act of the 21st April, 1806. In this way we may accomplish a\r\ncontinued and advantageous line of communication from the seat of the\r\nGeneral Government to St. Louis, passing through several very\r\ninteresting points of the Western country.\r\n\r\nI have thought it advisable also to secure from obliteration the trace\r\nof the road so far as it has been approved, which has been executed at\r\nsuch considerable expense, by opening one-half of its breadth through\r\nits whole length.\r\n\r\nThe report of the commissioners, herewith transmitted, will give\r\nparticular information of their proceedings under the act of the 29th\r\nMarch, 1806, since the date of my message of the 31st January, 1807, and\r\nwill enable Congress to adopt such further measures relative thereto as\r\nthey may deem proper under existing circumstances.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 25, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe dangers to our country arising from the contests of other nations\r\nand the urgency of making preparation for whatever events might affect\r\nour relations with them have been intimated in preceding messages to\r\nCongress. To secure ourselves by due precautions an augmentation of our\r\nmilitary force, as well regular as of volunteer militia, seems to be\r\nexpedient. The precise extent of that augmentation can not as yet be\r\nsatisfactorily suggested, but that no time may be lost, and especially\r\nat a season deemed favorable to the object, I submit to the wisdom of\r\nthe Legislature whether they will authorize a commencement of this\r\nprecautionary work by a present provision for raising and organizing\r\nsome additional force, reserving to themselves to decide its ultimate\r\nextent on such views of our situation as I may be enabled to present\r\nat a future day of the session.\r\n\r\nIf an increase of force be now approved, I submit to their consideration\r\nthe outlines of a plan proposed in the inclosed letter from the\r\nSecretary of War.\r\n\r\nI recommend also to the attention of Congress the term at which the act\r\nof April 18, 1806, concerning the militia, will expire, and the effect\r\nof that expiration.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 26, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI inclose, for the information of Congress, letters recently received\r\nfrom our ministers at Paris and London, communicating their\r\nrepresentations against the late decrees and orders of France and Great\r\nBritain, heretofore transmitted to Congress. These documents will\r\ncontribute to the information of Congress as to the dispositions of\r\nthose powers and the probable course of their proceedings toward\r\nneutrals, and will doubtless have their due influence in adopting\r\nthe measures of the Legislature to the actual crisis.\r\n\r\nAlthough nothing forbids the general matter of these letters from being\r\nspoken of without reserve, yet as the publication of papers of this\r\ndescription would restrain injuriously the freedom of our foreign\r\ncorrespondence, they are communicated so far confidentially and with\r\na request that after being read to the satisfaction of both Houses\r\nthey may be returned.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 1, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of February 26, I\r\nnow lay before them such memorials and petitions for the district of\r\nDetroit, and such other information as is in my possession, in relation\r\nto the conduct of William Hull, governor of the Territory of Michigan,\r\nand Stanley Griswold, esq., while acting as secretary of that Territory.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 2, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of November 30, 1807,\r\nI now transmit a report of the Secretary of State on the subject of\r\nimpressments, as requested in that resolution. The great volume of the\r\ndocuments and the time necessary for the investigation will explain to\r\nthe Senate the causes of the delay which has intervened.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 7, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn the city of New Orleans and adjacent to it are sundry parcels of\r\nground, some of them with buildings and other improvements on them,\r\nwhich it is my duty to present to the attention of the Legislature.\r\nThe title to these grounds appears to have been retained in the former\r\nsovereigns of the Province of Louisiana as public fiduciaries and for\r\nthe purposes of the Province. Some of them were used for the residence\r\nof the governor, for public offices, hospitals, barracks, magazines,\r\nfortifications, levees, etc., others for the townhouse, schools,\r\nmarkets, landings, and other purposes of the city of New Orleans; some\r\nwere held by religious corporations or persons, others seem to have\r\nbeen reserved for future disposition. To these must be added a parcel\r\ncalled the Batture, which requires more particular description. It is\r\nunderstood to have been a shoal or elevation of the bottom of the river\r\nadjacent to the bank of the suburbs of St. Mary, produced by the\r\nsuccessive depositions of mud during the annual inundations of the\r\nriver, and covered with water only during those inundations. At all\r\nother seasons it has been used by the city immemorially to furnish\r\nearth for raising their streets and courtyards, for mortar, and other\r\nnecessary purposes, and as a landing or quay for unlading firewood,\r\nlumber, and other articles brought by water. This having been lately\r\nclaimed, by a private individual, the city opposed the claim on a\r\nsupposed legal title in itself; but it has been adjudged that the legal\r\ntitle was not in the city. It is, however, alleged that that title,\r\noriginally in the former sovereigns, was never parted with by them,\r\nbut was retained in them for the uses of the city and Province, and\r\nconsequently has now passed over to the United States. Until this\r\nquestion can be decided under legislative authority, measures have been\r\ntaken according to law to prevent any change in the state of things and\r\nto keep the grounds clear of intruders. The settlement of this title,\r\nthe appropriation of the grounds and improvements formerly occupied for\r\nprovincial purposes to the same or such other objects as may be better\r\nsuited to present circumstances, the confirmation of the uses in other\r\nparcels to such bodies, corporate or private, as may of right or on\r\nother reasonable considerations expect them, are matters now submitted\r\nto the determination of the legislature.\r\n\r\nThe papers and plans now transmitted will give them such information on\r\nthe subject as I possess, and being mostly originals, I must request\r\nthat they may be communicated from the one to the other House, to answer\r\nthe purposes of both.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 10, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nA purchase having lately been made from the Cherokee Indians of a\r\ntract of land 6 miles square at the mouth of the Chickamogga, on the\r\nTennessee, I now lay the treaty and papers relating to it before the\r\nSenate, with an explanation of the views which have led to it.\r\n\r\nIt was represented that there was within that tract a great abundance of\r\niron ore of excellent quality, with a stream and fall of water suitable\r\nfor iron works; that the Cherokees were anxious to have works\r\nestablished there, in the hope of having a better supply of those\r\nimplements of household and agriculture of which they have learned the\r\nuse and necessity, but on the condition that they should be under the\r\nauthority and control of the United States.\r\n\r\nAs such an establishment would occasion a considerable and certain\r\ndemand for corn and other provisions and necessaries, it seemed\r\nprobable that it would immediately draw around it a close settlement\r\nof the Cherokees, would encourage them to enter on a regular life of\r\nagriculture, familiarize them with the practice and value of the arts,\r\nattach them to property, lead them of necessity and without delay to\r\nthe establishment of laws and government, and thus make a great and\r\nimportant advance toward assimilating their condition to ours. At the\r\nsame time it offers considerable accommodation to the Government by\r\nenabling it to obtain more conveniently than it now can the necessary\r\nsupplies of cast and wrought iron for all the Indians south of the\r\nTennessee, and for those also to whom St. Louis is a convenient deposit,\r\nand will benefit such of our own citizens likewise as shall be within\r\nits reach. Under these views the purchase has been made, with the\r\nconsent and desire of the great body of the nation, although not without\r\nsome dissenting members, as must be the case will all collections of\r\nmen. But it is represented that the dissentients are few, and under\r\nthe influence of one or two interested individuals. It is by no means\r\nproposed that these works should be conducted on account of the United\r\nStates. It is understood that there are private individuals ready\r\nto erect them, subject to such reasonable rent as may secure a\r\nreimbursement to the United States, and to such other conditions as\r\nshall secure to the Indians their rights and tranquillity.\r\n\r\nThe instrument is now submitted to the Senate, with a request of their\r\nadvice and consent as to its ratification.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 17, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have heretofore communicated to Congress the decrees of the Government\r\nof France of November 21, 1806, and of Spain of February 19, 1807, with\r\nthe orders of the British Government of January and November, 1807.\r\n\r\nI now transmit a decree of the Emperor of France of December 17,1807,\r\nand a similar decree of the 3d of January last by His Catholic Majesty.\r\nAlthough the decree of France has not been received by official\r\ncommunication, yet the different channels of promulgation through which\r\nthe public are possessed of it, with the formal testimony furnished by\r\nthe Government of Spain in their decree, leave us without a doubt that\r\nsuch a one has been issued. These decrees and orders, taken together,\r\nwant little of amounting to a declaration that every neutral vessel\r\nfound on the high seas, whatsoever be her cargo and whatsoever foreign\r\nport be that of her departure or destination, shall be deemed lawful\r\nprize; and they prove more and more the expediency of retaining our\r\nvessels, our seamen, and property within our own harbors until the\r\ndangers to which they are exposed can be removed or lessened.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 18, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe scale on which the Military Academy at West Point was\r\noriginally established is become too limited to furnish the number\r\nof well-instructed subjects in the different branches of artillery\r\nand engineering which the public service calls for. The want of such\r\ncharacters is already sensibly felt, and will be increased with the\r\nenlargement of our plans of military preparation. The chief engineer,\r\nhaving been instructed to consider the subject and to propose an\r\naugmentation which might render the establishment commensurate with\r\nthe present circumstances of our country, has made the report which\r\nI now transmit for the consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe idea suggested by him of removing the institution to this place is\r\nalso worthy of attention. Besides the advantage of placing it under the\r\nimmediate eye of the Government, it may render its benefits common to\r\nthe Naval Department, and will furnish opportunities of selecting on\r\nbetter information the characters most qualified to fulfill the duties\r\nwhich the public service may call for.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 22, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the present session I informed the Legislature that\r\nthe measures which had been taken with the Government of Great Britain\r\nfor the settlement of our neutral and national rights and of the\r\nconditions of commercial intercourse with that nation had resulted in\r\narticles of a treaty which could not be acceded to on our part; that\r\ninstructions had been consequently sent to our ministers there to resume\r\nthe negotiations, and to endeavor to obtain certain alterations,\r\nand that this was interrupted by the transaction which took place\r\nbetweenthe frigates _Leopard_ and _Chesapeake_. The call on that\r\nGovernment for reparation of this wrong produced, as Congress has been\r\nalready informed, the mission of a special minister to this country,\r\nand the occasion is now arrived when the public interest permits and\r\nrequires that the whole of these proceedings should be made known to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nI therefore now communicate the instructions given to our minister\r\nresident at London and his communications with that Government on\r\nthe subject of the _Chesapeake_, with the correspondence which has\r\ntaken place here between the Secretary of State and Mr. Rose, the\r\nspecial minister charged with the adjustment of that difference; the\r\ninstructions to our ministers for the formation of a treaty; their\r\ncorrespondence with the British commissioners and with their own\r\nGovernment on that subject; the treaty itself and written declaration of\r\nthe British commissioners accompanying it, and the instructions given by\r\nus for resuming the negotiation, with the proceedings and correspondence\r\nsubsequent thereto. To these I have added a letter lately addressed to\r\nthe Secretary of State from one of our late ministers, which, though\r\nnot strictly written in an official character, I think it my duty to\r\ncommunicate, in order that his views of the proposed treaty and of its\r\nseveral articles may be fairly presented and understood.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have heretofore and from time to time made such\r\ncommunications to Congress as to keep them possessed of a general and\r\njust view of the proceedings and dispositions of the Government of\r\nFrance toward this country, yet in our present critical situation, when\r\nwe find that no conduct on our part, however impartial and friendly, has\r\nbeen sufficient to insure from either belligerent a just respect for our\r\nrights, I am desirous that nothing shall be omitted on my part which may\r\nadd to your information on this subject or contribute to the correctness\r\nof the views which should be formed. The papers which for these reasons\r\nI now lay before you embrace all the communications, official or verbal,\r\nfrom the French Government respecting the general relations between the\r\ntwo countries which have been transmitted through our minister there,\r\nor through any other accredited channel, since the last session of\r\nCongress, to which time all information of the same kind had from\r\ntime to time been given them. Some of these papers have already been\r\nsubmitted to Congress, but it is thought better to offer them again in\r\norder that the chain of communications of which they make a part may be\r\npresented unbroken.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the 26th of February, I communicated to both Houses the letter\r\nof General Armstrong to M. Champagny, I desired it might not be\r\npublished because of the tendency of that practice to restrain\r\ninjuriously the freedom of our foreign correspondence. But perceiving\r\nthat this caution, proceeding purely from a regard to the public good,\r\nhas furnished occasion for disseminating unfounded suspicions and\r\ninsinuations, I am induced to believe that the good which will now\r\nresult from its publication, by confirming the confidence and union of\r\nour fellow-citizens, will more than countervail the ordinary objection\r\nto such publications. It is my wish, therefore, that it may be now\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 22, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn a separate message of this date I have communicated to Congress\r\nso much as may be made public of papers which give a full view of\r\nthe present state of our relations with the two contending powers,\r\nFrance and England. Everyone must be sensible that in the details of\r\ninstructions for negotiating a treaty and in the correspondence and\r\nconferences respecting it matters will occur which interest sometimes\r\nand sometimes respect or other proper motives forbid to be made public.\r\nTo reconcile my duty in this particular with my desire of letting\r\nCongress know everything which can give them a full understanding of the\r\nsubjects on which they are to act, I have suppressed in the documents\r\nof the other message the parts which ought not to be made public and\r\nhave given them in the supplementary and confidential papers herewith\r\ninclosed, with such references as that they may be read in their\r\noriginal places as if still standing in them; and when these\r\nconfidential papers shall have been read to the satisfaction of the\r\nHouse, I request their return, and that their contents may not be made\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 25, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn proceeding to carry into execution the act for fortifying our forts\r\nand harbors it is found that the sites most advantageous for their\r\ndefense, and sometimes the only sites competent to that defense, are in\r\nsome cases the property of minors incapable of giving a valid consent to\r\ntheir alienation; in others belong to persons who may refuse altogether\r\nto alienate, or demand a compensation far beyond the liberal justice\r\nallowable in such cases. From these causes the defense of our seaboard,\r\nso necessary to be pressed during the present season, will in various\r\nparts be defeated unless a remedy can be applied. With a view to this\r\nI submit the case to the consideration of Congress, who, estimating its\r\nimportance and reviewing the powers vested in them by the Constitution,\r\ncombined with the amendment providing that private property shall not\r\nbe taken for public use without just compensation, will decide on the\r\ncourse most proper to be pursued.\r\n\r\nI am aware that as the consent of the legislature of the State to the\r\npurchase of the site may not in some instances have been previously\r\nobtained, exclusive legislation can not be exercised therein by Congress\r\nuntil that consent is given. But in the meantime it will be held under\r\nthe same laws which protect the property of individuals and other\r\nproperty of the United States in the same State, and the legislatures\r\nat their next meetings will have opportunities of doing what will be\r\nso evidently called for by the particular interest of their own State.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 25, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now lay before Congress a statement of the militia of the United\r\nStates according to the latest returns received by the Department of\r\nWar. From the State of Delaware alone no return has been made.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 25, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to both Houses of Congress a report from the surveyor on the\r\npublic buildings of the progress made on them during the last session,\r\nof their present state, and of that of the funds appropriated to them.\r\nThese have been much exceeded by the cost of the work done, a fact not\r\nknown to me till the close of the season. The circumstances from which\r\nit arose are stated in the report of the surveyor.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 29, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nWhen the convention of the 7th of January, 1806, was entered into with\r\nthe Cherokees for the purchase of certain lands, it was believed\r\nby both parties that the eastern limit, when run in the direction\r\ntherein prescribed, would have included all the waters of Elk River.\r\nOn proceeding to run that line, however, it was found to omit a\r\nconsiderable extent of those waters, on which were already settled\r\nabout 200 families. The Cherokees readily consented, for a moderate\r\ncompensation, that the line should be so run as to include all the\r\nwaters of that river. Our commissioners accordingly entered into an\r\nexplanatory convention for that purpose, which I now lay before the\r\nSenate for consideration whether they will advise and consent to its\r\nratification. A letter from one of the commissioners, now also inclosed,\r\nwill more fully explain the circumstances which led to it.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Pike on his journey up the Mississippi in 1805-6, being at\r\nthe village of the Sioux, between the rivers St. Croix and St. Peters,\r\nconceived that the position was favorable for a military and commercial\r\npost for the United States whenever it should be thought expedient to\r\nadvance in that quarter. He therefore proposed to the chiefs a cession\r\nof lands for that purpose. Their desire of entering into connection\r\nwith the United States and of getting a trading house established there\r\ninduced a ready consent to the proposition, and they made, by articles\r\nof agreement now inclosed, a voluntary donation to the United States of\r\ntwo portions of land, the one of 9 miles square at the mouth of the St.\r\nCroix, the other from below the mouth of St. Peters up the Mississippi\r\nto St. Anthonys Falls, extending 9 miles in width on each side of the\r\nMississippi. These portions of land are designated on the map now\r\ninclosed. Lieutenant Pike on his part made presents to the Indians to\r\nsome amount. This convention, though dated the 23d of September, 1805,\r\nis but lately received, and although we have no immediate view of\r\nestablishing a trading post at that place, I submit it to the Senate for\r\nthe sanction of their advice and consent to its ratification, in order\r\nto give to our title a full validity on the part of the United States,\r\nwhenever it may be wanting, for the special purpose which constituted\r\nin the mind of the donors the sole consideration and inducement to the\r\ncession.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 30, 1808,\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nSince my message of the 22d instant letters have been received from our\r\nministers at Paris and London, extracts from which, with a letter to\r\nGeneral Armstrong from the French minister of foreign relations, and a\r\nletter from the British envoy residing here to the Secretary of State,\r\nI now communicate to Congress. They add to the materials for estimating\r\nthe dispositions of those Governments toward this country.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of both indicate designs of drawing us, if possible,\r\ninto the vortex of their contests; but every new information confirms\r\nthe prudence of guarding against these designs as it does of adhering\r\nto the precautionary system hitherto contemplated.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 2, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nBelieving that the confidence and union of our fellow-citizens at the\r\npresent crisis will be still further confirmed by the publication of the\r\nletter of Mr. Champagny to General Armstrong and that of Mr. Erskine to\r\nthe Secretary of State, communicated with my message of the 30th ultimo,\r\nand therefore that it may be useful to except them from the confidential\r\ncharacter of the other documents accompanying that message, I leave to\r\nthe consideration of Congress the expediency of making them public.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 8, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAgreeably to the request of the Senate in their resolution of yesterday,\r\nI have examined my papers and find no letter from Matthew Nimmo of\r\nthe date of November 28, 1806, nor any other from him of any date but\r\nthat of January 23, 1807, now transmitted, with all the papers in my\r\npossession which accompanied it. Nor do I find any letter from John\r\nSmith, of Ohio, bearing date at any time in the month of January, 1807.\r\n\r\nHaving delivered to the Attorney-General all the papers respecting the\r\nconspiracy of Aaron Burr which came to my hands during or before his\r\nprosecution, I might suppose the letters above requested had been\r\ndelivered to him; but I must add my belief that I never received such\r\nletters, and the ground of it. I am in the habit of noting daily in the\r\nlist kept for that purpose the letters I receive daily by the names of\r\nthe writers, and dates of time, and place, and this has been done with\r\nsuch exactness that I do not recollect ever to have detected a single\r\nomission. I have carefully examined that list from the 1st of November,\r\n1806, to the last of June, 1807, and I find no note within that\r\nperiod of the receipt of any letter from Matthew Nimmo but that now\r\ntransmitted, nor of any one of the date of January, 1807, from John\r\nSmith, of Ohio. The letters noted as received from him within that\r\nperiod are dated at Washington, February 2, 2, 7, and 21, which I have\r\nexamined, and find relating to subjects entirely foreign to the objects\r\nof the resolution of the 7th instant; and others, dated at Cincinnati,\r\nMarch 27, April 6, 13, and 17, which, not being now in my possession,\r\nI presume have related to Burr's conspiracy, and have been delivered to\r\nthe Attorney-General. I recollect nothing of their particular contents.\r\nI must repeat, therefore, my firm belief that the letters of Nimmo of\r\nNovember 28, 1806, and of John Smith of January, 1807, never came to\r\nmy hands, and that if such were written (and Nimmo's letter expressly\r\nmentions his of November 28), they have been intercepted or otherwise\r\nmiscarried.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 22, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to both Houses of Congress a letter from the envoy of His\r\nBritannic Majesty at this place to the Secretary of State on the subject\r\nof certain British claims to lands in the Territory of Mississippi,\r\nrelative to which several acts have been heretofore passed by the\r\nLegislature.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas information has been received that sundry persons are combined\r\nor combining and confederating together on Lake Champlain and the\r\ncountry thereto adjacent for the purposes of forming insurrections\r\nagainst the authority of the laws of the United States, for opposing the\r\nsame and obstructing their execution, and that such combinations are too\r\npowerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings\r\nor by the powers vested in the marshals by the laws of the United\r\nStates:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, to the end that the authority of the laws may be\r\nmaintained, and that those concerned, directly or indirectly, in any\r\ninsurrection or combination against the same may be duly warned, I have\r\nissued this my proclamation, hereby commanding such insurgents and all\r\nconcerned in such combination instantly and without delay to disperse\r\nand retire peaceably to their respective abodes. And I do hereby further\r\nrequire and command all officers having authority, civil or military,\r\nand all other persons, civil or military, who shall be found within\r\nthe vicinage of such insurrections or combinations to be aiding\r\nand assisting by all the means in their power, by force of arms or\r\notherwise, to quell and subdue such insurrections or combinations,\r\nto seize upon all those therein concerned who shall not instantly and\r\nwithout delay disperse and retire to their respective abodes, and to\r\ndeliver them over to the civil authority of the place, to be proceeded\r\nagainst according to law.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to\r\nbe affixed to these presents, and signed the same with my hand.\r\n\r\nGiven at the city of Washington, the 19th day of April, 1808, and in\r\nthe year of the Sovereignty and Independence of the United States the\r\nthirty-second.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JAMES MADISON,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEIGHTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 8, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIt would have been a source, fellow-citizens, of much gratification if\r\nour last communications from Europe had enabled me to inform you that\r\nthe belligerent nations, whose disregard of neutral rights has been so\r\ndestructive to our commerce, had become awakened to the duty and true\r\npolicy of revoking their unrighteous edicts. That no means might be\r\nomitted to produce this salutary effect, I lost no time in availing\r\nmyself of the act authorizing a suspension, in whole or in part, of the\r\nseveral embargo laws. Our ministers at London and Paris were instructed\r\nto explain to the respective Governments there our disposition to\r\nexercise the authority in such manner as would withdraw the pretext on\r\nof which the aggressions were originally founded and open the way for\r\na renewal of that commercial intercourse which it was alleged on all\r\nsides had been reluctantly obstructed. As each of those Governments had\r\npledged its readiness to concur in renouncing a measure which reached\r\nits adversary through the incontestable rights of neutrals only, and as\r\nthe measure had been assumed by each as a retaliation for an asserted\r\nacquiescence in the aggressions of the other, it was reasonably expected\r\nthat the occasion would have been seized by both for evincing the\r\nsincerity of their professions, and for restoring to the commerce of the\r\nUnited States its legitimate freedom. The instructions to our ministers\r\nwith respect to the different belligerents were necessarily modified\r\nwith a reference to their different circumstances, and to the condition\r\nannexed by law to the Executive power of suspension, requiring a decree\r\nof security to our commerce which would not result from a repeal of the\r\ndecrees of France. Instead of a pledge, therefore, of a suspension of\r\nthe embargo as to her in case of such a repeal, it was presumed that\r\na sufficient inducement might be found in other considerations, and\r\nparticularly in the change produced by a compliance with our just\r\ndemands by one belligerent and a refusal by the other in the relations\r\nbetween the other and the United States. To Great Britain, whose power\r\non the ocean is so ascendant, it was deemed not inconsistent with that\r\ncondition to state explicitly that on her rescinding her orders in\r\nrelation to the United States their trade would be opened with her, and\r\nremain shut to her enemy in case of his failure to rescind his decrees\r\nalso. From France no answer has been received, nor any indication that\r\nthe requisite change in her decrees is contemplated. The favorable\r\nreception of the proposition to Great Britain was the less to be\r\ndoubted, as her orders of council had not only been referred for\r\ntheir vindication to an acquiescence on the part of the United States\r\nno longer to be pretended, but as the arrangement proposed, whilst\r\nit resisted the illegal decrees of France, involved, moreover,\r\nsubstantially the precise advantages professedly aimed at by the\r\nBritish orders. The arrangement has nevertheless been rejected.\r\n\r\nThis candid and liberal experiment having thus failed, and no other\r\nevent having occurred on which a suspension of the embargo by the\r\nExecutive was authorized, it necessarily remains in the extent\r\noriginally given to it. We have the satisfaction, however, to reflect\r\nthat in return for the privations imposed by the measure, and which\r\nour fellow-citizens in general have borne with patriotism, it has had\r\nthe important effects of saving our mariners and our vast mercantile\r\nproperty, as well as of affording time for prosecuting the defensive and\r\nprovisional measures called for by the occasion. It has demonstrated to\r\nforeign nations the moderation and firmness which govern our councils,\r\nand to our citizens the necessity of uniting in support of the laws\r\nand the rights of their country, and has thus long frustrated those\r\nusurpations and spoliations which, if resisted, involved war; if\r\nsubmitted to, sacrificed a vital principle of our national independence.\r\n\r\nUnder a continuance of the belligerent measures which, in defiance of\r\nlaws which consecrate the rights of neutrals, overspread the ocean with\r\ndanger, it will rest with the wisdom of Congress to decide on the course\r\nbest adapted to such a state of things; and bringing with them, as they\r\ndo, from every part of the Union the sentiments of our constituents, my\r\nconfidence is strengthened that in forming this decision they will, with\r\nan unerring regard to the essential rights and interests of the nation,\r\nweigh and compare the painful alternatives out of which a choice is to\r\nbe made. Nor should I do justice to the virtues which on other occasions\r\nhave marked the character of our fellow-citizens if I did not cherish an\r\nequal confidence that the alternative chosen, whatever it may be, will\r\nbe maintained with all the fortitude and patriotism which the crisis\r\nought to inspire.\r\n\r\nThe documents containing the correspondences on the subject of the\r\nforeign edicts against our commerce, with the instructions given to\r\nour ministers at London and Paris, are now laid before you.\r\n\r\nThe communications made to Congress at their last session explained the\r\nposture in which the close of the discussions relating to the attack\r\nby a British ship of war on the frigate _Chesapeake_ left a subject on\r\nwhich the nation had manifested so honorable a sensibility. Every view\r\nof what had passed authorized a belief that immediate steps would be\r\ntaken by the British Government for redressing a wrong which the more it\r\nwas investigated appeared the more clearly to require what had not been\r\nprovided for in the special mission. It is found that no steps have been\r\ntaken for the purpose. On the contrary, it will be seen in the documents\r\nlaid before you that the inadmissible preliminary which obstructed the\r\nadjustment is still adhered to, and, moreover, that it is now brought\r\ninto connection with the distinct and irrelative case of the orders in\r\ncouncil. The instructions which had been given to our minister at London\r\nwith a view to facilitate, if necessary, the reparation claimed by the\r\nUnited States are included in the documents communicated.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the other powers of Europe have undergone no material\r\nchanges since your last session. The important negotiations with Spain\r\nwhich had been alternately suspended and resumed necessarily experience\r\na pause under the extraordinary and interesting crisis which\r\ndistinguishes her internal situation.\r\n\r\nWith the Barbary Powers we continue in harmony, with the exception of an\r\nunjustifiable proceeding of the Dey of Algiers toward our consul to that\r\nRegency. Its character and circumstances are now laid before you, and\r\nwill enable you to decide how far it may, either now or hereafter, call\r\nfor any measures not within the limits of the Executive authority.\r\n\r\nWith our Indian neighbors the public peace has been steadily maintained.\r\nSome instances of individual wrong have, as at other times, taken\r\nplace, but in no wise implicating the will of the nation. Beyond the\r\nMississippi the loways, the Sacs, and the Alabamas have delivered up\r\nfor trial and punishment individuals from among themselves accused of\r\nmurdering citizens of the United States. On this side of the Mississippi\r\nthe Creeks are exerting themselves to arrest offenders of the same kind,\r\nand the Choctaws have manifested their readiness and desire for amicable\r\nand just arrangements respecting depredations committed by disorderly\r\npersons of their tribe. And, generally, from a conviction that we\r\nconsider them as a part of ourselves, and cherish with sincerity their\r\nrights and interests, the attachment of the Indian tribes is gaining\r\nstrength daily--is extending from the nearer to the more remote, and\r\nwill amply requite us for the justice and friendship practiced toward\r\nthem. Husbandry and household manufacture are advancing among them more\r\nrapidly with the Southern than Northern tribes, from circumstances of\r\nsoil and climate, and one of the two great divisions of the Cherokee\r\nNation have now under consideration to solicit the citizenship of the\r\nUnited States, and to be identified with us in laws and government in\r\nsuch progressive manner as we shall think best.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the appropriations of the last session of Congress for\r\nthe security of our seaport towns and harbors, such works of defense\r\nhave been erected as seemed to be called for by the situation of the\r\nseveral places, their relative importance, and the scale of expense\r\nindicated by the amount of the appropriation. These works will chiefly\r\nbe finished in the course of the present season, except at New York and\r\nNew Orleans, where most was to be done; and although a great proportion\r\nof the last appropriation has been expended on the former place, yet\r\nsome further views will be submitted to Congress for rendering its\r\nsecurity entirely adequate against naval enterprise. A view of what has\r\nbeen done at the several places, and of what is proposed to be done,\r\nshall be communicated as soon as the several reports are received.\r\n\r\nOf the gunboats authorized by the act of December last, it has been\r\nthought necessary to build only 103 in the present year. These, with\r\nthose before possessed, are sufficient for the harbors and waters most\r\nexposed, and the residue will require little time for their construction\r\nwhen it shall be deemed necessary.\r\n\r\nUnder the act of the last session for raising an additional military\r\nforce so many officers were immediately appointed as were necessary for\r\ncarrying on the business of recruiting, and in proportion as it advanced\r\nothers have been added. We have reason to believe their success has been\r\nsatisfactory, although such returns have not yet been received as enable\r\nme to present you a statement of the numbers engaged.\r\n\r\nI have not thought it necessary in the course of the last season to call\r\nfor any general detachments of militia or of volunteers under the laws\r\npassed for that purpose. For the ensuing season, however, they will be\r\nrequired to be in readiness should their service be wanted, Some small\r\nand special detachments have been necessary to maintain trie laws of\r\nembargo on that portion of our northern frontier which offered peculiar\r\nfacilities for evasion, but these were replaced as soon as it could be\r\ndone by bodies of new recruits. By the aid of these and of the armed\r\nvessels called into service in other quarters the spirit of disobedience\r\nand abuse, which manifested itself early and with sensible effect while\r\nwe were unprepared to meet it, has been considerably repressed.\r\n\r\nConsidering the extraordinary character of the times in which we live,\r\nour attention should unremittingly be fixed on the safety of our\r\ncountry. For a people who are free, and who mean to remain so, a well\r\norganized and armed militia is their best security. It is therefore\r\nincumbent on us at every meeting to revise the condition of the militia,\r\nand to ask ourselves if it is prepared to repel a powerful enemy at\r\nevery point of our territories exposed to invasion. Some of the States\r\nhave paid a laudable attention to this object, but every degree of\r\nneglect is to be found among others. Congress alone having the power to\r\nproduce an uniform state of preparation in this great organ of defense,\r\nthe interests which they so deeply feel in their own and their country's\r\nsecurity will present this as among the most important objects of their\r\ndeliberation.\r\n\r\nUnder the acts of March 11 and April 23 respecting arms, the difficulty\r\nof procuring them from abroad during the present situation and\r\ndispositions of Europe induced us to direct our whole efforts to the\r\nmeans of internal supply. The public factories have therefore been\r\nenlarged, additional machineries erected, and, in proportion as\r\nartificers can be found or formed, their effect, already more than\r\ndoubled, may be increased so as to keep pace with the yearly increase\r\nof the militia. The annual sums appropriated by the latter act have\r\nbeen directed to the encouragement of private factories of arms, and\r\ncontracts have been entered into with individual undertakers to nearly\r\nthe amount of the first year's appropriation.\r\n\r\nThe suspension of our foreign commerce, produced by the injustice of\r\nthe belligerent powers, and the consequent losses and sacrifices of our\r\ncitizens are subjects of just concern. The situation into which we have\r\nthus been forced has impelled us to apply a pbrtion of our industry and\r\ncapital to internal manufactures and improvements. The extent of this\r\nconversion is daily increasing, and little doubt remains that the\r\nestablishments formed and forming will, under the auspices of cheaper\r\nmaterials and subsistence, the freedom of labor from taxation with us,\r\nand of protecting duties and prohibitions, become permanent. The\r\ncommerce with the Indians, too, within our own boundaries is likely to\r\nreceive abundant aliment from the same internal source, and will secure\r\nto them peace and the progress of civilization, undisturbed by practices\r\nhostile to both.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the receipts and expenditures during the year ending\r\nthe 30th of September last being not yet made up, a correct statement\r\nwill hereafter be transmitted from the Treasury. In the meantime it is\r\nascertained that the receipts have amounted to near $18,000,000, which,\r\nwith the eight millions and a half in the Treasury at the beginning\r\nof the year, have enabled us, after meeting the current demands and\r\ninterest incurred, to pay $2,300,000 of the principal of our funded\r\ndebt, and left us in the Treasury on that day near $14,000,000. Of\r\nthese, $5,350,000 will be necessary to pay what will be clue on the 1st\r\nday of January next, which will complete the reimbursement of the 8 per\r\ncent stock. These payments, with those made in the six years and a half\r\npreceding, will have extinguished $33,580,000 of the principal of the\r\nfunded debt, being the whole which could be paid or purchased within the\r\nlimits of the law and of our contracts, and the amount of principal thus\r\ndischarged will have liberated the revenue from about $2,000,000 of\r\ninterest and added that sum annually to the disposable surplus. The\r\nprobable accumulation of the surpluses of revenue beyond what can be\r\napplied to the payment of the public debt whenever the freedom and\r\nsafety of our commerce shall be restored merits the consideration of\r\nCongress. Shall it lie unproductive in the public vaults? Shall the\r\nrevenue be reduced? Or shall it not rather be appropriated to the\r\nimprovements of roads, canals, rivers, education, and other great\r\nfoundations of prosperity and union under the powers which Congress may\r\nalready possess or such amendment of the Constitution as may be approved\r\nby the States? While uncertain of the course of things, the time may be\r\nadvantageously employed in obtaining the powers necessary for a system\r\nof improvement, should that be thought best.\r\n\r\nAvailing myself of this the last occasion which will occur of addressing\r\nthe two Houses of the Legislature at their meeting, I can not omit the\r\nexpression of my sincere gratitude for the repeated proofs of confidence\r\nmanifested to me by themselves and their predecessors since my call to\r\nthe administration and the many indulgences experienced at their hands.\r\nThe same grateful acknowledgments are due to my fellow-citizens\r\ngenerally, whose support has been my great encouragement under all\r\nembarrassments. In the transaction of their business I can not have\r\nescaped error. It is incident to out imperfect nature. But I may say\r\nwith truth my errors have been of the understanding, not of intention,\r\nand that the advancement of their rights and interests has been the\r\nconstant motive for every measure. On these considerations I solicit\r\ntheir indulgence. Looking forward with anxiety to their future destinies,\r\nI trust that in their steady character, unshaken by difficulties, in\r\ntheir love of liberty, obedience to law, and support of the public\r\nauthorities I see a sure guaranty of the permanence of our Republic;\r\nand, retiring from the charge of their affairs, I carry with me the\r\nconsolation of a firm persuasion that Heaven has in store for our\r\nbeloved country long ages to come of prosperity and happiness.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 8, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe documents communicated with my public message of this day contain\r\nsuch portions of the correspondences therein referred to, of the\r\nministers of the United States at Paris and London, as relate to the\r\npresent state of affairs between those Governments and the United\r\nStates, and as may be made public. I now communicate, confidentially,\r\nsuch supplementary portions of the same correspondences as I deem\r\nimproper for publication, yet necessary to convey to Congress full\r\ninformation on a subject of their deliberations so interesting to\r\nour country.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 11, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe governor of the Mississippi Territory having thought it expedient\r\nto dissolve the general assembly of that Territory, according to the\r\nauthority vested in him by the ordinance of July 13, 1787, and having\r\ndeclared it dissolved accordingly, some doubt was suggested whether that\r\ndeclaration effected the dissolution of the legislative council. On\r\nmature consideration and advice I approved of the proceeding of the\r\ngovernor. The house of representatives of the Territory, since chosen,\r\nhave consequently nominated ten persons out of whom a legislative\r\ncouncil should be appointed. I do accordingly nominate and, by and with\r\nthe advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint John Flood McGrew,\r\nThomas Calvit, James Lea, Alexander Montgomery, and Daniel Burnet, being\r\nfive of the said ten persons, to serve as a legislative council for the\r\nsaid Territory, to continue in office five years, unless sooner removed\r\naccording to law.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 13, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now transmit to both Houses of Congress a report of the commissioners\r\nappointed under the act of March 29, 1806, concerning a road from\r\nCumberland to Ohio, being a statement of the proceedings under the said\r\nact since their last report communicated to Congress, in order that\r\nCongress may be enabled to adopt such further measures as may be proper\r\nunder existing circumstances.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 23, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAccording to the request of the Senate in their resolution of November\r\n14, that copies should be laid before them of all the orders and decrees\r\nof the belligerent powers of Europe, passed since 1791, affecting the\r\ncommercial rights of the United States, I now transmit them a report of\r\nthe Secretary of State of such of them as have been attainable in the\r\nDepartment of State and are supposed to have entered into the views of\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 27, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAccording to the request expressed by the Senate in their resolution of\r\nNovember 14, I now transmit a report of the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nand statement showing, as far as returns have been received from the\r\ncollectors, the number of vessels which have departed from the United\r\nStates with permission, and specifying the other particulars\r\ncontemplated by that resolution.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 30, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAt the request of the governor, the senate, and house of representatives\r\nof the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, I communicate certain resolutions\r\nentered into by the said senate and house of representatives, and\r\napproved by the governor, on the 23d instant. It can not but be\r\nencouraging to those whom the nation has placed in the direction of\r\ntheir affairs to see that their fellow-citizens will press forward\r\nin support of their country in proportion as it is threatened by the\r\ndisorganizing conflicts of the other hemisphere.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 30, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before the Legislature a letter from Governor Claiborne on the\r\nsubject of a small tribe of Alabama Indians on the western side of the\r\nMississippi, consisting of about a dozen families. Like other erratic\r\ntribes in that country, it is understood that they have hitherto\r\nmoved from place to place according to their convenience, without\r\nappropriating to themselves exclusively any particular territory; but\r\nhaving now become habituated to some of the occupations of civilized\r\nlife, they wish for a fixed residence. I suppose it will be the interest\r\nof the United States to encourage the wandering tribes of that country\r\nto reduce themselves to fixed habitations whenever they are so disposed.\r\nThe establishment of towns and growing attachments to them will furnish\r\nin some degree pledges of their peaceable and friendly conduct. The case\r\nof this particular tribe is now submitted to the consideration of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 6, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now lay before Congress a statement of the works of defense which it\r\nhas been thought necessary to provide in the first instance for the\r\nsecurity of our seaport towns and harbors, and of the progress toward\r\ntheir completion. Their extent has been adapted to the scale of the\r\nappropriation and to the circumstances of the several places.\r\n\r\nThe works undertaken at New York are calculated to annoy and endanger\r\nany naval force which shall enter the harbor, and, still more, one\r\nwhich should attempt to lie before the city. To prevent altogether the\r\nentrance of large vessels, a line of blocks across the harbor has been\r\ncontemplated, and would, as is believed, with the auxiliary means\r\nalready provided, render that city safe against naval enterprise. The\r\nexpense as well as the importance of the work renders it a subject\r\nproper for the special consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nAt New Orleans two separate systems of defense are necessary--the one\r\nfor the river, the other for the lake, which at present can give no aid\r\nto one another. The canal now leading from the lake, if continued into\r\nthe river, would enable the armed vessels in both stations to unite, and\r\nto meet in conjunction an attack from either side. Half the aggregate\r\nforce would then have the same effect as the whole, or the same force\r\ndouble the effect of what either can now have. It would also enable the\r\nvessels stationed in the lake when attacked by superior force to retire\r\nto a safer position in the river. The same considerations of expense and\r\nimportance render this also a question for the special decision of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 13, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now render to Congress the account of the fund established for\r\ndefraying the contingent expenses of Government for the year 1808.\r\nOf the $20,000 appropriated for that purpose, $2,000 were deposited in\r\nthe hands of the Attorney-General of the United States to pay expenses\r\nincident to the prosecution of Aaron Burr and his accomplices for\r\ntreason and misdemeanors alleged to have been committed by them; $990\r\nwere paid to the order of Governor Williams on the same account, and\r\nthe balance of $17,010 remains in the Treasury unexpended.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 17, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress certain letters which passed between the\r\nBritish secretary of state, Mr. Canning, and Mr. Pinkney, our minister\r\nplenipotentiary at London. When the documents concerning the relations\r\nbetween the United States and Great Britain were laid before Congress at\r\nthe commencement of the session, the answer of Mr. Pinkney to the letter\r\nof Mr. Canning had not been received, and a communication of the latter\r\nalone would have accorded neither with propriety nor with the wishes of\r\nMr. Pinkney. When that answer afterwards arrived it was considered that,\r\nas what had passed by conversation had been superseded by the written\r\nand formal correspondence on the subject, the variance in the two\r\nstatements of what had verbally passed was not of sufficient importance\r\nto be made the matter of a distinct and special communication. The\r\nletter of Mr. Canning, however, having lately appeared in print,\r\nunaccompanied by that of Mr. Pinkney in reply, and having a tendency\r\nto make impressions not warranted by the statements of Mr. Pinkney,\r\nit has become proper that the whole should be brought into public view.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 24, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAccording to the resolution of the Senate of the 17th instant, I\r\nnow transmit them the information therein requested, respecting the\r\nexecution of the act of Congress of February 21, 1806, appropriating\r\n$2,000,000 for defraying any extraordinary expenses attending the\r\nintercourse between the United States and foreign nations.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 30, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a letter recently received from our minister at\r\nthe Court of St. James, covering one to him from the British secretary\r\nof state, with his reply. These are communicated as forming a sequel to\r\nthe correspondence which accompanied my message to both Houses of the\r\n17th instant.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 18, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI submit a treaty, concluded at Brownstown, in the Territory of\r\nMichigan, between the United States and the Chippewas, Ottawas,\r\nPotawattamies, Wyandots, and Shawnees, on the 25th day of November\r\nlast, whereby those tribes grant to the United States two roads,\r\ntherein described, for the decision of the Senate whether they will\r\nadvise and consent to the ratification of it.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 24, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe Emperor of Russia has on several occasions indicated sentiments\r\nparticularly friendly to the United States, and expressed a wish through\r\ndifferent channels that a diplomatic intercourse should be established\r\nbetween the two countries. His high station and the relations of\r\nRussia to the predominant powers of Europe must give him weight with\r\nthem according to the vicissitudes of the war, and his influence in\r\nnegotiations for peace may be of value to the United States should\r\narrangements of any sort affecting them be contemplated by other powers\r\nin the present extraordinary state of the world; and under the constant\r\npossibility of sudden negotiations for peace I have thought that the\r\nfriendly dispositions of such a power might be advantageously cherished\r\nby a mission which should manifest our willingness to meet his good\r\nwill. I accordingly commissioned in the month of August last William\r\nShort, formerly minister plenipotentiary of the United States at Madrid,\r\nto proceed as minister plenipotentiary to the Court of St. Petersburg,\r\nand he proceeded accordingly; and I now nominate him to the Senate for\r\nthat appointment.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 25, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now lay before Congress a statement of the militia of the United\r\nStates according to the latest returns received by the Department\r\nof War.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Annals of Congress, Tenth Congress, second session, 462.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 30, 1808_.\r\n\r\n_The President of the United States to_ ------, _Senator for the\r\nState of_ ------.\r\n\r\nCertain matters touching the public good requiring that the Senate\r\nshould be convened on Saturday, the 4th day of March next, you are\r\ndesired to attend at the Senate Chamber, in the city of Washington,\r\non that day, then and there to deliberate on such communications as\r\nshall be made to you.\r\n\r\nTH.
