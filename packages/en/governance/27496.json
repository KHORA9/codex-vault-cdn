A\r\nfair and dispassionate application of true and just principles is as\r\nessential to a right political judgment as to a correct moral decision,\r\nand he who allows himself to be led by passion, selfishness, prejudice,\r\nor a blind adoration of party, instead of the calm convictions of\r\neducated reason and conscience, thereby dishonors himself, and abdicates\r\nthe right he possesses of acting for the best interests of himself and\r\nall. Especially is this true under a democratic form of\r\ngovernment--where every citizen is a legislator, virtually,--where\r\nopinion leads to political action, and is consequently responsible for\r\nthe course that action may take, and where each one helps to swell the\r\nnumbers of those great parties that in their plannings and\r\ncounterplannings make or mar the general good fortune. If this is true\r\nof individual citizens, how much more is it true of those mighty engines\r\nof the press and of party, that sweep such grand circles of influence,\r\nand install, in grandeur or in gloom, such important national\r\nconditions. That these are fruitful of evil as well as of good, every\r\ngreat national struggle, every crisis in the affairs of nations and of\r\nhumanity, bears witness. Every national contest has seen the rise and\r\nthe fall of an anti-war party, and felt the influence of a press wielded\r\nin the interest of that party. These have not, necessarily, always been\r\nin the wrong. The contrary has been often true, though their fall, and\r\nthe opprobrium cast upon them have been none the less sure. It is only\r\nwhen these have arisen during the progress of a war involving great\r\nmoral and humanitarian principles in its successful prosecution, that\r\nthe whole force of such an opposing influence is felt, the whole evil\r\napparent. No cause however just, no war however holy, no trust however\r\nhigh and honorable, but has met the violence of this evil opposition,\r\nand the danger of betrayal from this source. Not while men possess the\r\ngreed of power, place, and gold; not while reason is held in abeyance to\r\npassion, is freedom safe without a guardian, or the liberties of mankind\r\nable to abide without 'eternal vigilance.' Even our national war, the\r\ngrandest and holiest of time, both in its purposes and results, is only\r\nthe last most mournful illustration of this fact. When these\r\ncontemporaneous judgments, true or untrue, as they shall prove, now in\r\nthe heat of the time evolved in the thoughts of those who do think, and\r\nbecoming crystallized in the countless newspapers and periodicals which\r\ndeluge our land, and in the party records of the hour, come to be\r\nthoroughly sifted, and the sure and impartial verdict made up to pass\r\ninto 'the golden urn of history,' without appeal thenceforth, great will\r\nbe the glory or the shame of the prominent actors in the drama now\r\nenacting before the eyes of the world.\r\n\r\nWhat is the spectacle that our astonished eyes behold? The Genius of\r\nLiberty, standing on the threshold of her besieged temple, pale,\r\nfettered, betrayed in the house of her very friends, but resolute and\r\ndauntless as ever, her eye calm and steadfast, her hand firmly grasping\r\nthe Magna Charta of our birthright, and the birthright of all the race.\r\nWhile a raging and vindictive foe bays her in front, and the leal and\r\ntrue are pressing in countless hosts around her at her call, a false and\r\ncraven crew are basely creeping in at undefended passages, and, with\r\nlies and slanders and deceitful tongues, endeavoring to undermine the\r\nfoundations of her strength. Base sappers and miners! Thank God ye are\r\nfew! And the number of the people ye are trying to hoodwink and seduce\r\nfrom their allegiance is hourly growing less, as your cunningly devised\r\nschemes explode. Do ye not know that the people of the Free States are\r\nloyal to the core? That great principles are invincible as fate, say\r\nrather, Providence? and that those who will not move in their onward\r\ncourse must be overwhelmed beneath the wheels of their triumphal\r\nchariot? Do ye not fear the award of posterity? Let the partisan press\r\nof to-day, and those who inspirit and sustain it here at the North, who\r\nare vainly and impotently trying to turn back the tide of human progress\r\nby aiding and abetting the vilest rebellion against a good government\r\nthat has been seen since Satan, that arch rebel, chose 'rather to reign\r\nin hell than serve in heaven,' shudder at the report the unerring tongue\r\nof history will give them, even if they care nought for the good of\r\nhumanity as bound up in the well being of this land. I have called these\r\nmen _few_, for it _cannot be_ that the great and time-honored\r\norganization of which I hope these men are but the calumniators,\r\nboasting the grand old names of Jefferson and Jackson as founders, and\r\nenrolling in its ranks so many thousands of the substantial yeomanry and\r\nsolid men of the country, will really prove false to its name and trust,\r\nand be willing to descend into history in the robe of horror and infamy\r\nwhich, like the fabled shirt of Nessus, would cling to it forever as the\r\ncountry's betrayer, if it shall not shake itself free from these vile\r\ncontaminators. No party could survive the weight of the foul imputation\r\nof putting barriers in the way of this war, which, we firmly believe,\r\nthough terrible and bloody while it lasts, is to end by giving a fresh\r\nand vigorous impulse to the cause of human redemption and\r\nadvancement--an impulse that nothing thereafter shall be able to check\r\nmaterially.\r\n\r\nAlthough one only comprehensive principle lies at the bottom of the\r\nanomalous condition of things which preceded, and at last culminated in,\r\nthe tremendous civil contest through which the country is now passing--a\r\nfierce baptism of fire and blood necessary to purge and reinstate her in\r\npristine purity and grandeur, whose end is certainly not yet--still it\r\nis constantly assuming new disguises, and has been aptly likened to a\r\nvirulent and incurable cancer in the body politic, which, driven in in\r\none place, instantly breaks out with redoubled fierceness in another.\r\nIts latest and favorite form is that of hatred to New England. I have\r\ncalled it _Southern_ hatred of New England. By this I do not mean to\r\ndenote any geographical limit or boundary. This war is not a war of\r\nsections, but a war of ideas; and the terms _Southern_ and _Northern_\r\nare to be limited to this ideal meaning. The two sections, as such, are\r\nnot arrayed against each other, but the two antagonistic principles\r\nrepresented by these sections are, in sad truth, at deadly warfare. We\r\nsee Union men at the South, and secessionists at the North; but there is\r\nthis difference in the position of those who oppose the Government\r\nNorth, and those who favor it South. The former are would-be leaders,\r\nwho assume to act for the outraged people; the latter are merely _the\r\npeople_, or a portion of them, lacking organization and leadership, and\r\nconsequently obliged to submit to the tyranny that has laid its iron\r\nhand upon them. I do not believe, and never have believed, in the\r\nasserted unanimity of the Southern people. Recalling my eight years'\r\nresidence among, and acquaintance with, the people of the South, of two\r\nof the cotton States principally, I cannot think that they have, almost\r\nto a man, lost their respect and love for the national banner and\r\nauthority, and, rather than submit to it again, would prefer to be\r\n'_English Colonists_,' '_French vassals_,' or '_Russian serfs_!' No;\r\ntheir leaders first grossly cajole and deceive them, and then basely\r\nslander them. That there is an apparent oneness, I admit; but I think\r\nthe time is not far off when, if the Federal Government but does its\r\nduty, and uses its authority and strength wisely, crippling the rebel\r\nfaction in every possible way, thousands of liberated arms will spring\r\nforth to seize the sword in its defence, and as many liberated voices\r\nswell the _All hail!_ that will burst out for its welcome. For, so long\r\ntutored to the repression of any independent ideas, any sentiments that\r\ndo not tally with the doctrines to full belief in which these leaders\r\nhave aimed to educate the men of the last generation, viz., the divine\r\norigin and purpose of slavery, and the other mischievous and absurd\r\ndogma of State sovereignty, which, but for slavery and its imperative\r\ndemands, would never have seen the light, but have perished\r\nstillborn--they have no idea of the freedom of opinion and expression\r\npermitted among us, and their minds and consciences have become\r\nnerveless and supine to an astonishing degree; or, if thinking and\r\nfeeling, as very many do, they suffer in silence, not daring to resist\r\nthe oppressive faction that has ruled them so long. Moral force and\r\ncourage is not the fruit of subserviency to the principles and ideas\r\nthat have gradually filled the Southern mind. No wonder that the Union\r\nsentiment that showed itself so plainly at the outbreak of the rebellion\r\nbecame, ere long, like one of those streams that, starting impetuously\r\nfrom its mountain source, flows on awhile clearly and rapidly, and then\r\nbegins to wander and slacken its pace, till finally it is lost in the\r\ndreariness and desolation of some marshy wilderness, and so never\r\nreaches its destination, the open sea. There is no people in the world\r\nso abused and defrauded as the bulk of the Southern whites. If you pity\r\nthe oppressed of another race, then pity still more those of your own\r\nblood who are suffering a worse slavery, and who yet do not know it, but\r\nhug fondly the chains of their servitude. Then, too, consider the\r\nthousands of Northern men and women scattered all over the South, and\r\nsay if you think _they_ are linked, heart and hand, with the destroyers\r\nof the Government.\r\n\r\nBut with all this as an offset, still there is an undeniably strong and\r\nunscrupulous faction there, composed of the leading minds of the South,\r\nacute, imperious, sophistical, used to political and social rule, and\r\nbacked by a small but cunning minority here at the North, so vile and\r\ncontemptible that, in comparison with its adherents, they, these slave\r\noligarchs, are 'Hyperion to a satyr.' These, with the thousands both\r\nNorth and South, misled and befooled by them, form the formidable\r\nopposition with which the Government is even now closing in a\r\nlife-or-death encounter. These represent one of the two grand ideas at\r\nlast met in a decisive struggle on this North American Continent, after\r\nthe numberless petty skirmishes, reconnoissances, and lesser conflicts\r\nwhich have stained the battle fields of the world with the best blood of\r\nhumanity during so many thousand years. No child's play now--no\r\ndiplomatic dissembling--no sword thrusts intended to be parried, no\r\nmachiavelian hits nor disguises. The fight is close, desperate, deadly;\r\nit is yard arm to yard arm; it is heart seeking for naked heart,\r\nflashing eye to eye, visor down, and hot breath mingling with hot\r\nbreath, as the foes close in the last grapple. The other idea is\r\nembodied in the principles of the Constitution and the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and is represented by the Federal authority. The South,\r\nthen, is taken to mean the one, and the North, its opposite. On one side\r\nbarbarism, slavery, injustice, ignorance, despotism, the woes and\r\nmaledictions of oppressed races, the carnival of fiends; on the other,\r\ncivilization, freedom, justice, education, republicanism, the gladness\r\nand gratitude of redeemed humanity, the jubilee of joy among angels. On\r\nthe side of disunion, endless bickerings, intestine wars, standing\r\narmies, crushing debts, languishing commerce, all improvement at a stand\r\nstill, tyranny settling darkly down over the liberties of the people and\r\nof individuals, and national influence gone forever. On the side of\r\nUnion, honorable peace, legitimate expansion, social order and\r\nimprovement, increasing commerce, the education and elevation of the\r\nmasses, the path of success open to all, the freedom and rights of all,\r\neven the least and poorest secured, and the nation occupying a front\r\nrank among nations, her flag loved no less than feared, her government\r\nthe model one of the world, and the great experiment of self-government\r\nsafe beyond the peradventure of failure. Who doubts the issue of such a\r\nstruggle--who would cheat himself of being one with God and good men in\r\nthe glory of a triumph so possible and certain?\r\n\r\nBut why is it that the hate of all rebels, North and South, is so\r\nmalignantly directed toward New England especially? What has she done\r\nmore than New York or Illinois? Again I reply, it is not geographical\r\nNew England that is so feared and hated, but the ideas she represents. I\r\nhave called these, already, the _Northern_ idea. But if the nature of\r\nour political philosophy be closely scanned, if we exactly analyze the\r\ngenius of our institutions in their proper and unbiased action, we shall\r\nbe forced to acknowledge that it was the _Puritan_ idea which\r\npredominated; that it is, in fact, the saving clause in the gospel of\r\nour national salvation. And New England was the first home of the\r\nPuritans--the focus from which have radiated the myriad beams of the\r\nlight of which they were the repositories to the remotest corners of the\r\nland. Let no one be alarmed at the mention of the word _Puritan_. There\r\nare some people who have no other notion of a Puritan than that of a\r\nclose-cropped, saturnine personage, having a nasal twang, who is\r\nforevermore indulging an insane propensity to sing psalms, quote\r\nScripture, or burn witches. These are the people who can never see into\r\nthe profound deep of a great truth, but are quite ready to laugh at its\r\ntravesty or caricature. And what high or holy truth has not been\r\ncaricatured? For one, I envy not the head or the heart of him who can\r\nthink the name of Puritan a badge of shame or reproach, and who has no\r\nsympathy nor admiration for the stern resolution, the wondrous\r\nfortitude, the deep enthusiasm for freedom, the unwavering faith, and\r\nthe high religious devotion of those men and women who first lit a torch\r\nin the wilderness, soon to become the beacon light of the world.\r\n\r\nNor would I be understood to mean a wholesale and indiscriminate\r\nadoration of the Puritans as a _sect_. The appellation, which was\r\nbestowed upon them in opprobrium, and which they certainly wore in no\r\nmeek manner, but evidently gloried in as a word of highest praise and\r\nhonor, I use as a convenient one to characterize the idea I would\r\nrepresent. These men were but the chosen instruments in the hands of Him\r\nwho no doubt has ever ordered the course of affairs in the world, to\r\nopen up a new epoch in its history. The time was ripe--the men had been\r\nmoulded--and through them the free principles which had been culminating\r\nthrough the ages, which had stirred the souls, animated the\r\nimaginations, and quickened the desires of the best and noblest of the\r\nrace from its birth till now, were at last to find a resistless voice, a\r\nlimitless scope, an unrepressed expansion, on a new and magnificent\r\ntheatre. For freedom is of no time, nor clime, nor color, nor sect, nor\r\nnationality. She is the primal gift of God to his intelligent creatures,\r\nand is the kingly dower of every human soul. She was not born with the\r\nPuritans, nor did she die with them. In no age or land, among no sect or\r\npeople, has she been without her priesthood, her altar, her ritual, her\r\nheart worship. Nor is she to blame for the wrongs and atrocities\r\ncommitted in her name. The ideas and principles the Puritans were\r\nordained to carry out and embody in a great political structure were of\r\nthe noblest, rarest, most enduring and beneficent; the faults that\r\nmarred the beauty and consistency of their own character, were the\r\nexaggerations of their virtues, and arose from the frailty and\r\ninstability of the human heart, even when most governed and inspired by\r\nthe highest motives. The principles remain steadfast, immovable,\r\nimmortal; the defects we can but grieve over and forgive for the sake of\r\nthe grandeur they only marred but could not destroy.\r\n\r\nThrough the weakness of our nature, through the deceitfulness of the\r\nheart, the zeal which, in its proper exercise, is admirable, as inciting\r\nus to a grand enthusiasm in a cause believed to be true and holy,\r\nofttimes degenerates into a blind and bitter bigotry, as unreasoning as\r\nreprehensible; the faith which pierces the unseen and eternal, and fixes\r\nits calm eye on One who sits changeless amid infinite series of changes,\r\nall-wise amid infinite follies and wickednesses of His creatures,\r\nall-merciful and all-loving amid the hate and opposition of weak, finite\r\nhearts, becomes a gloomy asceticism, or a fierce inquisitorial\r\ndespotism, perverting Him--this glorious and loving God--into a cold,\r\nselfish, unreasonable Being, as far removed from our sympathies and love\r\nas He is from caring for us, and only existing to receive the hateful\r\nhomage of fearful and enslaved souls; and what _was_ a high,\r\ndisinterested, fearless devotion to truth and duty becomes a narrow,\r\nselfish, insane thirst for the ascendency of sect or party, or the\r\npropagation of some pet dogmas, which, so far from touching practically\r\nthe happiness, duty, or destiny of the soul, are mere stumbling stones,\r\nstrewing the dark mountains of vain, egotistic, arrogant human\r\nspeculation. As there is no power so relentless as a theological or\r\nspiritual despotism, so there is no tendency of the mind more easy,\r\nsubtle, or strong, than a tendency toward it. To say these men erred, is\r\nto say that they were men. But if they partook of the common liability\r\nto error of this nature, let us not forget that but for them, fallible\r\nand inconsistent as they were, the seeds of liberty, wafted from a\r\nthousand shores, and gathered through thousands of ages, might not have\r\nbeen transplanted to this continent, nor this mighty banyan of American\r\nfreedom have struck its million roots into the soil far and wide, and\r\nstretched its million interlacing arms abroad, a sure and safe refuge\r\nfor the nations.\r\n\r\nIt is not as a _sect_ that I admire the Puritans. Away with all party\r\nlines, all sectional prejudices, all barriers of creed or sect at such a\r\ntime as this, when all nations and creeds and colors are forming in\r\nserried ranks, a close and impervious breakwater, to resist the\r\nthreatening tide of rebellion and ruin whose sullen roar is in our ears,\r\nand when 'heaps of brothers slain' look into the sad face of heaven from\r\nfields where they fell, battling heroically to preserve the common\r\nheritage. No! a better day is dawning--a day of fairer promise, of more\r\ntranquil beauty, of more enduring blessedness, than ever before\r\ngladdened the hearts of men. To see that day come, all the good and true\r\nand loyal are waiting and working, no matter of what faith, or tongue,\r\nor nationality. I do not regard the sins of the Puritans as resulting\r\nfrom the principles by which they professed to be governed, but rather\r\nas something extraneous and antagonistic to them. Their ideas and\r\nprinciples resulted in the broadest constitutional liberty, while the\r\nfree thought, free speech, free inquiry, the wide individual freedom,\r\nwhich, as a church, under the influence of a stern theological despotism\r\nthey sought to stifle, under those very institutions they founded are\r\nto-day the pride, the life, the glory of free and progressive New\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIt is only in this broad sense, then, that I use the term _Puritan_, to\r\ndenote the agency whereby Providence saw fit to inaugurate the ideas\r\nwhich were to form the foundation of our national polity.\r\n\r\nThe Puritan idea, then, predominated in the principles embodied in the\r\nDeclaration of Rights and in the Constitution. But says one, Washington\r\nwas no Puritan, nor Jefferson, nor the majority of the first framers of\r\nour Government. Granted that they were not born on Puritan soil, _par\r\nexcellence_, but were they not of the spirit and understanding of the\r\nPuritans? (In fact, I suspect that Washington was a Puritan of the\r\nPuritans.) A Virginia Puritan, a cavalier Puritan even, was not then the\r\nstrange phenomenon, the _lusus naturæ_, it would be nowadays. Besides,\r\nlet it be remembered that the Constitution was not the production of any\r\nman or set of men. It was the outgrowth of the political ideas and\r\nnecessities of the age and country. These men, trained in the spirit of\r\nthe time, gave direction to their development, assisted to inaugurate\r\nthe reign of those ideas, and to give them a specific embodiment, no\r\nmore. Great and good men they were--the fit productions of the renowned\r\nepoch of the birth of a great people. It is a noble thing, a thing for\r\nfame and just pride, if men live at such a time who can share the\r\ninspiration, and cause it to live in great deeds, to say nothing of\r\ncreating it.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are the distinguishing characteristics of this Puritan idea\r\nor influence?\r\n\r\nSince the country had a history at all, New England has been reputed the\r\ncentre, the abiding home of a pure morality. This needs no elaborate\r\nargument to sustain it. The records of her criminal and civil courts\r\nattest it; so do the general good order of her small communities and\r\nlarger cities, as well as the high character of the numerous men and\r\nwomen who, emigrating to the various portions of the country, carry with\r\nthem, wherever they choose a home, the pure principles they have\r\nlearned around the home firesides in their native New England--the\r\nindustry, the thrift, the obedience to law, the superior intelligence,\r\nwhich make them the best citizens in any community. The New England\r\ncommunities, generally, possess a higher standard of morals, a more\r\nintelligent adhesion to what is regarded as duty, a more simple social\r\nintercourse, and purer social manners and customs, with fewer\r\ndissipations and derelictions, than perhaps any other people in the\r\nworld can boast. Nor is there claimed for the New England Puritan a\r\nperfect character. On the contrary, there are some traits which, in\r\ntheir excess, we could wish were omitted in his composition. These,\r\nhowever, will be found to be but exaggerations of his virtues for the\r\nmost part, and for the sake of those virtues can easily be tolerated,\r\nthough they have been sufficiently inveighed against from time to time.\r\nFrom this high state of morals there results a very high degree of\r\n_social_ order, which, in its result, again, gives large social and\r\nindividual liberty. Nowhere will there be found a freer people, and yet\r\none more observant of law. Indeed, the former is only the effect of the\r\nlatter. A cultivated reason sees at once that the more perfectly law is\r\nobserved, the more absolute does freedom become; that the highest\r\npersonal and social freedom is only attainable through a perfect\r\nobedience to the laws by which persons and societies are bound.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is no doubt true, and may be stated as a characteristic\r\ncorrelated to the one above mentioned, that nowhere else is a purer\r\ngospel preached than in New England. The piety of the New England heart\r\nis deep and strong, if not demonstrative and fervent. It is not like the\r\nsweep of the winds, nor the rush of the torrents; its faith may be\r\nburning, but it is the steady burning of the hidden fire, a vestal\r\nflame, not the glare of the conflagration. It rather reminds me, in its\r\ndepth and strength and purity, of the ocean, calm, uniform, and\r\nmonotonous outwardly, but concealing under its surface many a swift\r\ncurrent and strong countercurrent, many a fair expanse, many a lovely\r\nsecret of life, beauty, and glory. The religious faith of New England\r\nfully and devoutly receives those sublime doctrines of Christianity\r\nwhich were given as good news, indeed, to the race; not to a favored\r\nfew, but to the individual man and woman of the race. It credits in a\r\nreal and literal sense the declaration of Paul that 'God hath made of\r\n_one_ blood all the nations of the earth;' and the opening sentence of\r\nthe Declaration of Rights is something more to them than a 'glittering\r\ngenerality.' A deep, intelligent religious faith may be said to underlie\r\nall the institutions of New England, political and social. For what _is_\r\nthat genius of Christianity that has ever found its truest exponent in\r\nthe teachings of the New England theology, and in the lives and practice\r\nof her people? Is it not the liberty of every person, without respect to\r\ncolor or condition, but simply in consideration of his humanity, to\r\nlearn and to obey every law of his being, physical, moral, intellectual,\r\nsocial, and religious? To be untrammelled in following out the best\r\nlight conscience and revelation may afford him as to the constitution\r\nand laws of his being, his duty to himself, his fellow man, and his\r\nCreator, and his destiny, which he himself is to determine? The\r\nChristian religion may be comprehensively defined as the golden circlet\r\nwhich includes all the complex duties, interests, and affections of the\r\nmost complex being, man, and lifts him up, and binds him back, with all\r\nhis capacities, hopes, and sympathies, to the throne of the Infinite,\r\nfrom which, in his low, fettered, and sinful estate, he is an alien; and\r\nall this through the love and mercy of the Infinite One Himself. This I\r\nconceive to be the true intent and glorious result of Christianity, when\r\nallowed to have free and unimpeded action on the soul of man. It will\r\nbe seen to be wellnigh limitless--a power adequate to the work to be\r\naccomplished, and in this sense is truly 'the power of God and the\r\nwisdom of God.' This power is dominant, either consciously or\r\nunconsciously, over every relation of life in New England, being\r\ninterwoven in the very life of her institutions. I believe this secret,\r\nquiet, yet active, all-pervading influence is very little understood,\r\nand yet it will explain much in the Puritan character that no other key\r\nwill unlock. I have mentioned a pure morality, which is the effect,\r\nbefore a pure Christianity, which is the cause, simply because the\r\neffect is more obvious at first glance.\r\n\r\nThe third great characteristic of the Puritan idea is a _pure\r\nrepublicanism_. In the largest sense, I hold this also to be the effect\r\nof the one just mentioned; for, if tested, the whole spirit and tone of\r\nChristianity are republican. On New England soil, from the hour when the\r\nlittle band of pilgrim heroes first set foot on an inhospitable shore,\r\nby their footprints upon it making a barren rock a holy shrine for the\r\nworld's love and veneration, has ever been a sure refuge, a very\r\npalladium of republican institutions, of human liberties. It was not\r\nalone its religious tendencies that excited the persecution and\r\ndetestation of Puritanism in the Old World which gave impulse to the\r\nresolution to transplant themselves to a land where freedom, if nothing\r\nelse, was to be found. It was equally as much its republican and\r\ndemocratic theories. Souls made free by the spirit of the Lord, as the\r\nsouls of those grand old Puritans were, could no more brook the tyranny\r\nof the Charleses and Georges of Britain, and so, through blood and fire\r\nand sword and chains, was the germ of liberty borne across the watery\r\nwaste, to be sown anew, as they thought and proposed, in the genial soil\r\nof the region bordering on the Hudson, but, as God willed it, in the\r\nperverse and barren soil of rockbound, sea-washed New England. Truly\r\nthis was a novel spectacle. Never in the history of peoples before was\r\nit seen that a bare idea was strong enough to lay the foundations of a\r\ngreat state, through persecution, exile, and death, and untold\r\nprivations worse than death. O you who would bring discredit on the\r\nmemory and name of the Puritans, recall this noblest era of time; rise\r\nfor one hour, if your souls have any wings, to the height of this\r\ngrandeur, and bid calumny and defamation be dumb!\r\n\r\nThis germ of republican freedom took deep root, and acquired an\r\nineradicable hold of their civil polity, and the whole machinery of\r\ntheir civil government; and, spreading from New England to the adjoining\r\ncolonies, and from these to others, soon permeated the whole\r\nconfederation, at length forming the basis of a national government, a\r\nnational condition which has heretofore represented the highest\r\ncivilization of the world.\r\n\r\nIs it not plain, then, _why_ they do so, who oppose and hate the\r\ninfluence and ideas of New England? If anything could measure the utter\r\nvileness of slavery and its degrading effect on the mind, it would be\r\nthe consideration of the unblushing assurance with which its lovers\r\ndefend it, and at the same time assail those sacred principles which lie\r\nat the root of our national life, and without which we are dead and\r\ncumbering the ground. Our nation holds _in trust_ certain principles,\r\nfor the successful carrying out of which the nations of the earth wait\r\nin hushed and anguished expectancy, and in the failure of which we\r\nshould be no better than any of the effete, defunct peoples of buried\r\nages; or, rather, in the failure to bring them to a triumphant\r\nvindication, we had far better be as Sodom and Gomorrah. These\r\nprinciples are now the stake for which the loyal men of the land are\r\ngladly offering up life, treasure, children, _all_, so they but win.\r\n\r\nWe hear a great deal, nowadays, from rebel sources, of the different\r\nrace which settled Virginia and Carolina from that which peopled New\r\nEngland, and the immeasurable superiority of the former. If the\r\nmouthpiece of the confederacy, Mr. Jefferson Davis, may be believed, the\r\nlatter and their descendants are not worthy even to be the _slaves_ of\r\nthe former, and are a degree lower in the scale of creation than the\r\n_hyenas_! Differing in language, manners, customs, ideas, there is no\r\npossibility of a peaceable union, say the confederate organs. In fine,\r\nlanguage is exhausted of epithets expressive of their scorn, contempt,\r\nand hatred of the _Yankees_, as they are opprobriously nicknamed. But do\r\nthese men ignore the fact that the original settlers of both New England\r\nand Virginia were purely English? They were from the same stock\r\nprecisely. As to the _character_ of each, I cannot do better than to\r\nquote from a work of which Americans may well be both glad and proud, a\r\nwork that has set us and our institutions in a truer and juster light\r\nthan any before it. I allude to the work of M. De Tocqueville on\r\n'Democracy in America.' In volume first, chapter fifth, he says:\r\n\r\n     'The men sent to Virginia were seekers of gold, adventurers without\r\n     resources and without character, whose turbulent and restless\r\n     spirits endangered the infant colony, and rendered its progress\r\n     uncertain. The artisans and agriculturists arrived afterward; and\r\n     although they were a more moral and orderly race of men, they were\r\n     in no wise above the level of the inferior classes in England. No\r\n     lofty conceptions, no intellectual system, directed the foundation\r\n     of these new settlements.'\r\n\r\nHe adds, in a note:\r\n\r\n     'It was not till some time later, that a certain number of rich\r\n     English capitalists came to fix themselves in the colony.'\r\n\r\nIt is true that in the course of time some men of high character and\r\nposition were attracted to the genial climate and virgin resources of\r\nthe new Southern colonies, and, buying up large tracts of land, fixed\r\nthemselves permanently, sensibly modifying the condition of affairs. The\r\ndescendants of such men as these afterward became the most famous\r\nleaders of the Revolution which Puritan principles effected. They were\r\nmen of whom descendants may well be proud, but it is certain that they\r\nhave had _very few_ descendants; _therefore_, the great body of the\r\nslaveholders, each one of whom would fain believe himself, and try to\r\nmake others believe him, a scion of this renowned stock, must have had a\r\nvery different origin.\r\n\r\nIn striking contrast with the above account, here is what he says of the\r\nfirst settlers of the Northern colonies:\r\n\r\n     'The settlers who established themselves on the shores of New\r\n     England all belonged to the more independent classes of their\r\n     native country. Their union on the soil of America at once\r\n     presented the singular phenomenon of a society containing neither\r\n     lords nor common people, neither rich nor poor. These men\r\n     possessed, in proportion to their number, a greater mass of\r\n     intelligence than is to be found in any European nation of our own\r\n     time. All, without a single exception, had received a good\r\n     education, and many of them were known in Europe for their talents\r\n     and their acquirements. The other colonies had been founded by\r\n     adventurers without family; the emigrants of New England brought\r\n     with them the best elements of order and morality; they landed in\r\n     the desert, accompanied by their wives and children. But what most\r\n     especially distinguished them was the aim of their undertaking.\r\n     They had not been obliged by necessity to leave their country; the\r\n     social position they abandoned was one to be regretted, and their\r\n     means of subsistence were certain. Nor did they cross the Atlantic\r\n     to improve their situation, or to increase their wealth: the call\r\n     which summoned them from the comforts of their homes was purely\r\n     intellectual; and in facing the inevitable sufferings of exile,\r\n     their object was the triumph of an idea.'\r\n\r\nLet the world judge between the Puritan and the so-called Cavalier!\r\n\r\nAs the same author remarks--'The influence of slavery, united to the\r\nEnglish character, explains the manners and the social condition of the\r\nSouthern States;' so it is no less true, that the influence of an almost\r\nunlimited democracy, the product of widespread intelligence and pure\r\nreligion, united to the English character, explains the peculiar\r\ncivilization of New England. It is nothing strange, certainly, that,\r\nafter the wide and continued divergence of two aggressive principles for\r\nmore than two hundred years, they should at last come to stand in the\r\nposition of giant antagonisms, and close in a deadly grapple for the\r\nascendency. It is perfectly natural that the ignorance and mental\r\ndarkness of slave Virginia or Carolina should fear and hate above all\r\nthings the light of knowledge that streams from New England; it is\r\nnatural that the unquestioned immorality and laxity of principle\r\nengendered by slavery should shrink from the contrast with a state of\r\nmorals unsurpassed for purity in the world; and that an obsequious\r\nchurch and clergy, which, in the holy name of religion, and 'using the\r\nlivery of heaven to serve the devil in,' had dared by the thinnest\r\nsophistries and most palpable perversions to garble the true teachings\r\nof the Bible, and been willing to brave the anathemas denounced against\r\nthose who add to or subtract from aught written therein, should accede\r\nwillingly to a separation which could relieve them somewhat from an\r\nodious comparison, to say the least. Compare the vigorous, consistent,\r\nand sublime theology of New England, the widely spread influence of her\r\ncultivated and philanthropic clergy, with that part of the clergy and\r\nchurch of the South which, in sustaining slavery, has lost all hold upon\r\nhuman sympathies, all influence, save in the regions where the highest\r\ncrime against humanity has become a matter of interest, of sordid\r\nspeculation. Alas! what sadder spectacle could be seen than the\r\nministers of Christ using their talents to lead their people into wrong,\r\nmocking religion, trailing its snowy wings in the mire of the most\r\ncorrupt political dogmas, doing their utmost to upheave that grand\r\ncorner stone set by Christ himself in the primal temple of Christianity\r\nand humanity: 'All things whatsoever you would that men should do to\r\nyou, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.'\r\n\r\nThat men and women, taught from infancy to look upon slavery as a moral\r\nand political as well as a material good; whose ideas, manners, habits\r\nhave become interwoven with its existence in their midst, and who, no\r\nmatter how falsely, as those may think who look upon it from a\r\ncomparatively disinterested standpoint, conceive that it lies at the\r\nbase of their social prosperity and happiness; who have been accustomed\r\nfrom forum, hustings, pulpit, and press, to hear an institution that\r\nappeals to so many selfish instincts and principles in the human heart,\r\nlauded and defended, and made to be the Ultima Thule of Southern hope,\r\npride, and ambition; that they should view with displeasure and anger\r\nsuch an influence as the institutions of New England must always wield,\r\nis not so surprising. But that men can be found here in the free North,\r\nyea, more, in New England itself, to sympathize with them, to echo their\r\ndegraded sentiments, and to wish to see the slave power supreme in the\r\nland, is what surpasses wonder, and almost belief. Yet a portion of a\r\nlarge, old, and venerated party have come to be their miserable allies\r\nand claqueurs. The truth is, we may say and believe that slavery is a\r\ndire wrong, a foul injustice, done to a whole race, and therefore ought\r\nto die, but that does not tell one half of the damning story: the worst\r\nis this, that it gradually kills out the virtue, the manliness, the\r\nmoral vitality of the nation that allows it; that it has done so in our\r\nown nation to an alarming extent is the great, the fear-impelling cause\r\nwhy it should be rooted out, abolished, as an influence in the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n'Ah, but,' says the Northern traitor, 'that very _abolition_ has done\r\nthe whole mischief. If there had been no Abolitionists, there would have\r\nbeen no war. The _Abolitionists_ are responsible for it all.' Softly,\r\npoor, weak-minded man! Does not any man's common sense tell him that\r\nwherever a wrong exists, it is in the nature of things that somebody\r\nshould oppose it--that a desire should arise to get rid of it? It is the\r\n_chief_ mercy of God to the world, next to His providing salvation for\r\nit, that this _conscience_ is left to it, this sense of wrong, and the\r\nwill and struggle to abolish the wrong. For such remonstrance the\r\nAbolitionists are indeed responsible!\r\n\r\nThere are certain words that have come to be used in an indefinite,\r\ncanting sort of way, so that they have no meaning at all, or, at least,\r\na meaning very deceptive. These words represent bugbears to unthinking\r\npeople, and unscrupulous men do not fail to pervert this fact to their\r\nown or party ends. Such are some of the terms which have been applied to\r\nNew England, both South and North. She is called _radical_, and a most\r\nabsurd and mischievous idea of New England radicalism is rife,\r\nespecially in the South. Said a Southern gentleman to me on one occasion\r\n(he was a physician, was one of the most intelligent slaveholders I ever\r\nmet, and was an occasional contributor to De Bow's _Review_):\r\n\r\n     'You New Englanders do not believe anything; you are all\r\n     freethinkers--is it not so?'\r\n\r\n_Par parenthese_, that word _freethinker_ is another of the terms\r\nconventionally abused. This gentleman had just been speaking of this\r\nvery thing, New England radicalism, and in his query showed an evident\r\nidea that it involved that species of unbelief, that discarding of all\r\ncreeds or standards of belief, popularly known as _freethinking_. It\r\nalso includes, in the minds of many of the Southern people, the exercise\r\nof a kind of personal license, an abandoning of the good old established\r\nlandmarks of thought and action, and a strong-minded striking out into\r\nnew paths of experiment, regardless of form or law. A Northern woman\r\ngoing to the South is assumed to be _strong-minded_, especially, till\r\nshe has proved herself _feminine_. There is nothing so absurd as this\r\nidea, when one considers that there is no people on earth as free,\r\nindependent, and original, intellectually, as they are, who possess so\r\ndeep and abiding a respect and veneration for those same laws and\r\ninstitutions. New England is the prolific hive whence swarm all the\r\n_isms_ that infest the country, say they. They do not understand that in\r\na state of society where education is universal, where mind is\r\nconstantly meeting mind, and thought clashing with thought, the restless\r\nand heaving mass must be always throwing up something to the surface, it\r\nmay be froth, it may be tangled weeds, rough stones, or plain shells, or\r\nit may be curious and valuable gems fit to glitter in a coronet, or\r\nshells of dazzling colors and manifold convolutions fit to shine in rare\r\ncabinets. The waveless and stagnant calm of the mass of the Southern\r\nmind can have no conception of the intellectual movement that is ever\r\ngoing on in such a community as New England.\r\n\r\nBut this radicalism especially bears on its 'horrid front' that bugbear\r\nof all conservatism, the world over--_abolition_. There is no word so\r\nabused as that. The thing itself is as old and inevitable as the\r\nrelation of cause and effect, as the existence of sin and righteousness,\r\nas the contest between God and Satan. Just as if there could help being\r\nan abolition sentiment where there existed the aggressive, hateful\r\nprinciple of slavery!\r\n\r\nThen that peculiar and valuable trait of Yankee character, which the\r\nFrench so aptly call _savoir faire_, and which they themselves term\r\n_faculty_, the power of accomplishing, the knowing how to do, the\r\nunderstanding how to suit means to ends, which makes a Yankee so useful\r\nand versatile, and consequently a valuable acquisition to society--has\r\nreceived its full share of Southern abuse and ridicule. 'They palm off\r\nupon us their inventions, half of which are worthless,' say they. 'They\r\ncheat us with their wares, their manufactures, their patents, and\r\nnostrums. They grow rich on our necessities, and take the world's trade\r\nfrom our harbors, so superior to theirs, and they are always busy, and\r\nintermeddling in everybody's affairs; and we hate them--ah, how we _do_\r\nhate them!' In short, a certain leading class at the South, that which\r\nmoulds and leads the hollow, shrinking, scared thing they called _public\r\nopinion_, have come to hate and detest everything distinctively New\r\nEnglish, and finally to make the wicked, traitorous attempt to overturn\r\nthe Government, which they know received its highest and controlling\r\nimpulse from the Puritan ideas of that portion of the country. In the\r\nmaterial world, nothing is plainer than the fact embodied in the old\r\nadage, 'Straws show which way the wind blows.' In the realm of moral and\r\nsocial law, however, the indications, just as palpable, of the direction\r\nin which the current of public sentiment is setting, are usually ignored\r\nor pass unobserved at the time being; and not till great events have\r\ncalled attention to the causes that produced them, do these indications\r\ntake all the prominence due to them. These minor symptoms I have\r\nnoticed, of the dislike of New England in the Southern mind, have been\r\nplainly to be seen in all the doings and sayings of their public men of\r\nthis generation at least, to go no further back, and in the utterances\r\nof the press throughout the South. Flings, innuendoes, sarcasms,\r\ncondescensions, insults, have been heaped upon the _Yankees_, by the\r\nrepresentatives of the slave power, in the National Congress, in the\r\nState Legislatures, in their public speeches, and by the minions of the\r\npress, until it would seem as if they must have fallen on dead ears, so\r\nlittle fever they have stirred in the blood of the North. Still, if\r\nanyone supposes that the ostensible causes of dislike are the real ones,\r\nhe is mistaken. Does any man of them all, of these leaders, I mean,\r\nsuppose for one instant that the Yankee negro-trader, overseer, peddler,\r\nlucre-loving tradesman, slaver, slave catcher, subservient politician,\r\nor mouthing, dirt-swallowing pulpit huckster, is a true representative\r\nof the influence and ideas of New England? Or that the present\r\nCopperhead Democracy of that section is the real exponent of the genuine\r\nspirit of the Puritan Democracy? Certainly not. They are shrewd men, of\r\ngreat discernment, and in their way brave and chivalrous, and I verily\r\ndo not wonder if they would not have these renegade Yankees even as\r\n_slaves_. No! the actual cause of their hatred is the silent,\r\nall-pervading influence of the _free institutions_ of New England, which\r\nderive their power and efficacy from the universal means of education\r\nthere enjoyed. Shut up the schoolhouses, and burn the schoolbooks in New\r\nEngland, to-day, and let these free institutions become a dead letter\r\nthereby, and the _Yankees_ would be as good as anybody in their eyes,\r\nbecause the sword which their intelligence keeps ever suspended over the\r\nhead of slavery would be effectually laid to rust in its scabbard. Is it\r\nnot a pitiful, a disgusting sight, that men are found, Northern men,\r\n_New-England Yankees_ even, to kneel before the slaveocrats still, after\r\nthe load of scorn and contumely already heaped upon them, and humbly\r\ncry, 'More--give us more contempt--our backs are made to bear the\r\nburden!'\r\n\r\nGod pity such creatures!\r\n\r\nAnd these are the men who advocate a confederation of States with New\r\nEngland left out to shift for herself! New England left out? Fools! to\r\nthink it possible. Knaves! to deem it desirable, if it were possible. As\r\nwell banish the Creator from the universe He has made--the sun from the\r\nsystem he warms and enlightens! Not until you have destroyed the\r\nessence, the inner spirit of the Government which of all the governments\r\nin the world secures 'the greatest good to the greatest number;' not\r\nuntil Freedom is dead and laid in her final grave; not until the temple\r\nof knowledge is barred and double barred; not until all your common\r\nschools are closed, your free presses manacled, your free Bible\r\nsuppressed, your right of free speech and free inquiry smothered to\r\ndeath; not until your ships have gone down in the waters, and the hammer\r\nrests in your shipyards, and your railroads cease to open a way in the\r\nwilderness made straight for the entrance of the most advanced\r\ncivilization; not until the race of Yankee capitalists is extinct, and\r\nenterprise, thrift, industry, nerve, moral courage, the intellectual\r\nconquest of the material world become traditional, will that be\r\npossible. No! I thank God, that the record of New England is so sure and\r\nindelible that nothing can root her out of this land, not even if her\r\nwhole geographical area were forever submerged by the waters of the\r\nocean that girts her round in barren majesty. Ideas, principles, can\r\nnever die or be effaced. They shall survive the wreck of matter, and the\r\nfinal catastrophe of the universe. And her empire is that of ideas.\r\nSmall as she is, she wields the power of the very foremost ideas of the\r\nhighest civilization of the world. These ideas have at last held at bay\r\nthe so long encroaching slave principles which were so strangely left to\r\ngrow alongside with them by the early framers of the Government, and who\r\ndoubts which is to conquer? The struggle may be a long one, a costly\r\none, and freedom may at last barely escape with her life. But so sure as\r\nhumanity sweeps onward; so sure as the average progress of the race is\r\nnever retrograde; so sure as right bears in its bosom the seeds of\r\neternal life, and wrong the seeds of eternal death; so sure as God sits\r\non His throne and the heavens do rule,' the free ideas of New England\r\nwill yet bear sway over this continent, and, in their moral force at\r\nleast, mould and remodel the governments of the world. If not preserved\r\nintact by the men of this generation, then by others will this ultimate\r\nresult be reached. God is not confined in His agencies. He sets up one,\r\nand puts down another, and the generation that is found worthy to build\r\nthe temple for Him to dwell in, to preserve and perfect the beautiful\r\nheritage He has provided for His freedmen, His redeemed and enfranchised\r\npeople out of all the nations in which they have been held in mental and\r\npolitical bondage, shall have the honor and privilege, be sure. And\r\nthink not, O ye men to whom is committed this high trust, that it will\r\nbe a small thing to leave this birthright unto others; for as no people\r\nwere ever before so distinguished in having this holiest ark of the\r\ncovenant of freedom in their midst, so the grave of infamy into which ye\r\nshall be cast, if the Philistines dispossess you of it, shall be\r\nbottomless. There is no resurrection for the people who should betray\r\nsuch a cause, freighted as it is with the hopes and future destiny of\r\nthe struggling races of the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd O ye other men (would ye _were_ men!) who are in league\r\nwith traitors, ay, who are even worse than they, to do\r\nthis accursed thing, know that this pit is yawning for you.\r\nDown--down--deeper--deeper--pressed to perdition by the curses\r\nof those who are to come after you, whom you wronged so remorselessly.\r\n\r\nIn that terrific vision of hell, seen by the poet Dante, those who had\r\nbetrayed country, freedom, were visited by the most awful sufferings,\r\npursued by the most vengeful fiends, and pushed to the most dire\r\nextremity of woe. Among the pale, haunted, shrieking shades flitting\r\nthrough that limbo of horrors, they were conspicuous in punishment. And\r\nif remorse is in reality the undying worm, the quenchless fire of that\r\nfuture state which recompenses for the deeds of this, surely the traitor\r\nto this good, free Government will be made to experience its unmeasured\r\nhorrors. The salvation of our country, then, and its position and\r\ninfluence as one of the family of nations, depend on its return to, and\r\nits enforcing of, those fundamental principles of freedom, moral right,\r\nand justice which underlie our system, and for the most part form our\r\nsuperstructure. Ours is the moral lever that is to move the world, if we\r\nwill have it so. If we lose our moral prestige we are nothing. We have\r\nthe best Government in the world, but it has, since the time of the\r\nfathers, for the most part, been the worst administered. Instead of\r\nbeing made to work in the interest of freedom, the opposite has been the\r\nfact, and the whole influence and patronage of the Government for years\r\nhave been in favor of the slave element. Prior to the incoming of the\r\npresent Administration, this gradual deterioration in the animus of the\r\nFederal Government had culminated in a condition so disgraceful and\r\nshameful, that it is enough to dye the cheek of any honest man with red,\r\nonly to think of it. It was time, if ever, for the climax to be put upon\r\nit all, and now it will be a thing to give endless thanks for, if enough\r\nvirtue and manliness and true patriotism are left in the loyal States to\r\nbring the nation, under God, safely through the troubles and disasters\r\ninto which its supineness, its temporizing and subserviency to wrong\r\nhave led it.\r\n\r\nOh, could I speak with the convincing tones of a prophet or an angel,\r\ninstead of the weak voice of a woman, I would make myself heard\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of the land by every man, of whatever\r\ncaste or color, whatever birth or tongue, whatever nationality or\r\npolitical creed, North, East, West, South, and especially this great\r\nWest, of which I am so proud and confident, and would say to them:\r\n\r\n'Rise! quit you like men--be strong! Upon you the ends of the world have\r\ncome. If you have manhood, assert it now! If you are worthy the name of\r\nAmerican, make it _now_ to be honored among the nations. If there is any\r\nincentive in the glory of the career that would open to the accelerated\r\nprogress of a Union at last free and redeemed, without a tyrant or a\r\nslave, let it nerve your hearts and inspire your exertions _now_. If you\r\ndo not desire the self-gratulations of the crowned despots of the world,\r\nand the despair and lamentation of their subject millions, see to it\r\nthat this great experiment of self-government fail not _now_. If you\r\nwould gladden the hearts of our friends in other lands, the Brights and\r\nCobdens, the Gasparins and Laboulayes, liberal men, who love truth,\r\njustice, right, freedom, who are 'one with their kind,' be ambitious of\r\ncoöperating with them in the work of human elevation and amelioration.'\r\n\r\nThose who seize upon great opportunities are the men whom History\r\nrescues from oblivion, and sets in the memory of mankind forever,\r\nwhether with blessings or cursings, with glory or shame, as the\r\nbenefactors or the enemies of their kind. A rare opportunity is passing\r\nbefore this nation. Who will seize upon it, and how? We shall see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAITING FOR NEWS!\r\n\r\n\r\n     The succeeding Poem, 'Waiting for News,' was written by a mother,\r\n     who says.\r\n\r\n     'If there is any power in truth, this poem should express what is\r\n     intended; for my own boy, but little more than fifteen, had been in\r\n     the battle at Culpepper, and I knew not if he were living or dead!\r\n     He was far too young to enter the army, but I could not resist his\r\n     earnest pleadings--for he is tall and manly, and I well know, were\r\n     _I_ in his place, I too would shoulder my knapsack and go!'\r\n\r\n     All honor to such mothers!--ED.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Waiting, O Father! a fond mother waiting,\r\n   Waiting _so_ anxious, the dark tide's abating!\r\n   Waiting all breathless, in agonized anguish,\r\n   Living by heart-throbs that spring up--then languish;\r\n   Catching each sound that comes back from the battle,\r\n   Dark shrieks and groans and the lonely death rattle,\r\n   Imaging visions of feverish thirsting--\r\n   Hearts in their utterest loneliness bursting!\r\n\r\n   Thinking of _him_, late the babe of her bosom,\r\n   Fair faced and blue eyed, love's tenderest blossom,\r\n   Dashing along 'mid the carnage around him,\r\n   Fearless as Mars 'mid the balls that surround him,\r\n   Changed, as by magic, from home's tender brother,\r\n   Lovingest son, both to father and mother--\r\n   Changed to a man, to a stern, noble soldier--\r\n   None in the field that is braver or bolder!\r\n   Writing: 'I'm proud of the name, dearest mother!\r\n   Craven is he who would hold any other\r\n   While our loved standard of freedom 's in danger,\r\n   May he forever be held as a stranger!'\r\n   Such are the words in his last noble letter!\r\n   What fifteen years that could write any better?\r\n   Now I am waiting to know if he 's wounded--\r\n   Waiting--to know how my fears must be bounded:\r\n   Closed his eyes _may_ be to sorrow or danger--\r\n   Dead he _may_ be in the land of the stranger!\r\n\r\n   God of the desolate--Rachel's Consoler!\r\n   Light of the universe--Nature's Controller!\r\n   Pity me, pity me!

They\r\nhave so long been associated together, not only in popular tradition but\r\nin books, that the greater part of the reading world seem to think them\r\nto have been the original partners in the republic of letters. Indeed,\r\nfor some absurd reason or other, the opinion is even yet quite prevalent\r\nthat one of the original concern has been a silent partner, though not a\r\nsleeping one, in every printing establishment since. The proposition, to\r\nthis extent, is certainly inadmissible; and yet, from the moral\r\ncondition of a large portion of the press, it must be confessed there is\r\nstrong presumptive evidence that in the unhappy influences exercised by\r\nthe personage referred to over the affairs of men, he is not altogether\r\nneglectful of the press. Be this, however, as it may, the press has\r\nbecome, in this country especially, an engine of such great importance\r\nin the daily affairs of life--its energies are of such tremendous power,\r\neither for good or evil, that it is believed a few moments can be\r\nprofitably spent in glancing at its rise and early progress in Boston\r\nand New York.\r\n\r\nThe honor of setting up the first printing press in the American\r\nColonies belongs to Massachusetts. Only eighteen years had elapsed from\r\nthe landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth, before a press was in operation\r\nat Cambridge--then as populous as Boston. The project of establishing a\r\npress in the New World was conceived and almost executed by the Rev.\r\nJesse Glover, a dissenting clergyman in England, who had interested\r\nhimself largely in planting the colony, and a portion of whose family\r\nwas already in America. Mr. Glover raised the means of purchasing his\r\npress, types, and other necessary apparatus by contributions in England\r\nand Holland. With these materials he embarked for America in 1638, but\r\ndied a few days before the ship reached the shore. Cambridge was at that\r\ntime the seat of the civil and ecclesiastical power in Massachusetts;\r\nand as the academy which subsequently grew into Cambridge University had\r\nthen been commenced, it was determined by the leading men of the colony\r\nto establish the press there; and there it remained for sixty years\r\nunder their control, and forty years before a press was established in\r\nany other colony. The first printer was Stephen Day, engaged in London\r\nby Mr. Glover, and supposed to be a descendant of the celebrated John\r\nDay, the noted printer. The second printer in the Colonies was Samuel\r\nGreen, to whom Day relinquished the business in 1649. Colonel Samuel\r\nGreen, the late venerable editor of the _New London Gazette_, was a\r\ndescendant in a direct line from the original printer of that name; the\r\nfamily having uninterruptedly engaged in that business for nearly two\r\nhundred years. The elder Green printed the Indian Bibles and Testaments\r\nfor those early apostles of the New World who first engaged in the\r\nbenevolent work of attempting the civilization and evangelization of the\r\naboriginals of this country--a noble race of wild men, who have melted\r\naway before the palefaces, like the hoarfrost beneath the beams of the\r\nmorning sun.\r\n\r\nThe sturdy republican religionists of New England became very soon as\r\nchary of allowing the freedom of the press as were the Pontiff and the\r\ncrowned heads of Europe. Some religious tracts having been published\r\nwhich the clergy and the General Court deemed of too liberal a\r\ncharacter, licensers of the press were appointed in 1662; but in the\r\nyear following, it was ordered by the Provincial Government that 'the\r\nprinting press be as free as formerly.' This freedom, however, was soon\r\nexerted more freely than ever. The attention and the fears of the\r\nGovernment were accordingly again awakened; and in October, 1664, it was\r\nenacted that no printing press should be allowed in any other town or\r\nplace of the colony than Cambridge; and that no person or persons should\r\nbe permitted to print anything even there, but by the allowance of at\r\nleast two of a board of three censors appointed for that purpose. But\r\neven the licensers were not sufficiently rigid to please the General\r\nCourt--for, having permitted the publication of that most excellent and\r\npious little work, 'The Imitation of Christ,' by Thomas à Kempis, it was\r\nheld to be heretical by the Legislature, and its further publication\r\nwithout a new revision was prohibited in 1667. The principal\r\nspecification against it was that it was written by a Popish minister.\r\n\r\nIn 1671, the General Court directed the revision and publication of the\r\nlaws of the colony. Until that time the laws had always been printed at\r\nthe expense of the commonwealth. But a wealthy bookseller, by the name\r\nof John Usher, applied for permission to publish them on his own\r\naccount; and to prevent Green from printing extra copies for himself, he\r\nprocured the passage of an act prohibiting the printing of any more\r\ncopies than he should direct; and in this enactment we find the origin\r\nof copyright in this country. In 1673, the copyright was secured to\r\nUsher for seven years. Green soon became a prolific printer. He came to\r\nthis country so destitute as to be obliged to sleep under the shelter of\r\na barrel; but lived to an advanced age, and had two wives and nineteen\r\nchildren. He was early in life elected an ensign of the Cambridge\r\nmilitia company, and subsequently rose to the rank of captain, under\r\nwhich commission he served thirty years. So exceeding fond was he of his\r\nmartial life, that, when extremely old, he was carried to the parade\r\nground in a chair to direct the exercises of his company. Some of his\r\ndescendants have been engaged in the printing business for more than a\r\ncentury past in Connecticut. Others of his family established their\r\nbusiness at Annapolis, in Maryland, in 1740, where it has been continued\r\nby their descendants until the present day.\r\n\r\nThe partner of the elder Green, for a number of years, was Marmaduke\r\nJohnson, who had been sent over from England by the Commissioners of\r\nIndian affairs to assist in printing the Bible in the Indian language.\r\nHe turned out badly, however, and, in two years after his arrival, was\r\ntried and convicted of making an unlawful _impression_ upon Mr. Green's\r\ndaughter. The charge in the indictment was 'for alluring the daughter of\r\nMr. Samuel Green, printer, and drawing away her affection, without the\r\nconsent of her father.' This was a direct breach of the law of the\r\ncolony; for in those good times, no young lady might venture to fall in\r\nlove without, like a dutiful child, asking her father's consent. But\r\nJohnson was doubly guilty, since he had a wife in England. He was\r\ntherefore fined five pounds, and ordered to go home to his first love.\r\nThis order, however, was for a time evaded; and he afterward found means\r\nof procuring a reconciliation with Green--his wife having probably died\r\nin the mean time--and of entering into a partnership with the father of\r\nhis American charmer. Her prudent father, however, as is most likely,\r\nobliged her to leave off loving him, since the chronicles of those days\r\nsay that the inconstant typographer was married in 1770 to Ruth Cane of\r\nCambridge. He then began to look up in the world, and was elected to the\r\noffice of constable, which in those days was much more elevated than\r\nthat of sheriff is now.\r\n\r\nIn 1674 the first press was established in Boston by permission of the\r\nGeneral Court; and two additional licensers were appointed--one of whom\r\nwas the Rev. Increase Mather. The printer was John Foster, who was also\r\nsomewhat of an astronomer. He made and printed almanacs; but died at the\r\nearly age of thirty-three. He was a man of so much consideration that\r\ntwo poems were published on the occasion of his death. One of them\r\nconcluded with the following lines:\r\n\r\n   'This body, which no activeness did lack,\r\n   Now 's laid aside like an old almanack;--\r\n   But for the present 's only out of date,\r\n   'Twill have at length a far more active state.\r\n   Yea, though with dust thy body soiled be,\r\n   Yet at the resurrection we shall see\r\n   A fair EDITION, and of matchless worth,\r\n   Free from ERRATAS, new in Heaven set forth;\r\n   'Tis but a word from God, the Great Creator,\r\n   It shall be done, when he saith IMPRIMATUR.'\r\n\r\n'Whoever,' says Isaiah Thomas, 'has read the celebrated epitaph of\r\nFranklin on himself, will have some suspicion that it was taken from\r\nthis original.'\r\n\r\nOne of Green's apprentices was an Indian lad, who became master of the\r\nbusiness, and assisted in printing Eliot's Indian Bible. When King\r\nPhilip's war came on, however, his bosom was fired with _amor patriæ_,\r\nand he ran off and joined himself to his countrymen. Returning again,\r\nunder the proclamation, after the death of the great Narragansett king,\r\nJames, for such was his English name, obtained a pardon, and worked at\r\nthe business for the remainder of his life. From Eliot's account of him,\r\nhe was the most accurate printer in the colony--the only one 'who was\r\nable to correct the press with understanding.' He printed the Psalter\r\nand several other works in the Indian language; and being always known\r\nas James the Printer, he assumed the latter as his surname. He married\r\nand reared a family by that name, whose descendants were recently living\r\nin Grafton.\r\n\r\nThe first newspaper published in North America was the _Boston News\r\nLetter_, commenced in April, 1704, by John Campbell. It was printed by\r\nthe authority of the licensers, as a half sheet of what was then called\r\npot paper--a large size of foolscap. Campbell was a bookseller, and the\r\npostmaster of Boston. The paper was printed by Bartholomew Green. The\r\nfirst number contained the Queen's speech to both houses of Parliament;\r\nsome notice of the attempts of the Pretender, James the Eighth of\r\nScotland, who was said to be sending over Popish missionaries from\r\nFrance; three or four paragraphs of domestic intelligence; four items of\r\nship news from Philadelphia, New York, and New London; and one\r\nadvertisement by the editor. The paper was continued fifteen years,\r\nweekly, upon the half sheet of foolscap, without a rival on the\r\ncontinent, and continually languishing for want of support.[A] In 1719\r\nthe editor made a great effort to enlarge his publication. He stated in\r\nhis prospectus that he found it to be impossible, with a weekly half\r\nsheet, to carry on all the public occurrences of Europe, with those of\r\nthe American colonies and the West Indies. He was then thirteen months\r\nbehind the news from Europe, and to obviate the difficulty he resolved\r\nto publish every other week a full sheet of foolscap, he afterward\r\nannounced, as the advantage of this enlargement, that in eight months he\r\nwas able to bring down the foreign news to within five months of the\r\ndate of his publication!\r\n\r\nWhat a contrast between the newspaper of that day and our own! _Then_\r\nnews from England, five months old, was fresh and racy. Now we must have\r\nit in twelve days, and even then send out fleets of newsboats from Cape\r\nRace to bring it to us two days sooner than steam can take the ship up\r\nto New York and Boston. _Then_, news seven days old from New York to\r\nBoston was swift enough for an express. Now, if we cannot obtain the\r\nnews from Washington in less than the same number of minutes, we rave\r\nand storm, and talk of starting new telegraph companies. _Then_, four\r\nsnug little foolscap papers a month contained all that the world was\r\ndoing that any one cared to know. Now, a paper published every morning\r\nas large as a mainsail needs a supplement; and I presume there is not an\r\neditor in any of our large cities who publishes half the new matter he\r\ngets prepared.\r\n\r\nThe second American newspaper was the _Boston Gazette_, the first number\r\nof which was published in December, 1719, by William Brookes, the\r\nsuccessor of Campbell as postmaster. It was printed on half a sheet of\r\nfoolscap by James Franklin, brother of Benjamin Franklin, who served his\r\napprenticeship with him. The proprietor, printer, and publisher of the\r\n_Gazette_, however, were soon changed; and in 1721 the _New England\r\nCourant_ was established in Boston by James Franklin, who was both\r\nproprietor and publisher. With the establishment of this paper commenced\r\nthe newspaper wars of America, which have continued ever since.\r\nFranklin, piqued at having been ousted from the _Gazette_, commenced\r\nattacking that journal with bitterness. He did not make the _Courant_ so\r\nmuch of a newspaper as an essayist; and it was filled with discussions\r\nof the prevailing religious opinions of that day, and with attacks upon\r\nthe public officers and the clergy. These essays were furnished by a\r\nsociety of nine literary gentlemen, who were called a set of\r\nfreethinkers by some, and the 'Hell Fire Club' by others. Young Benjamin\r\nwrote some of the essays, although the authorship was not at the time\r\nknown. Among other matters, inoculation for the small pox was then\r\nwarmly opposed as being highly improper. The character of the paper was\r\nspirited, and its tone that of religious scepticism. It was not long in\r\nattracting much of the public attention, and in provoking the resentment\r\nof the colonial Government and clergy. The Rev. Increase Mather having\r\nbeen claimed in the _Courant_ as one of its supporters, came out with a\r\nlong and wrathful contradiction of the assertion. 'I can well remember,'\r\nsays that eminent and excellent divine, 'when the civil Government would\r\nhave taken an effectual course to suppress such a _cursed libel_! which,\r\nif it be not done, I am afraid that some _awful judgment_ will come upon\r\nthis land, and that the wrath of God will arise, and there will be no\r\nremedy. I cannot but pity poor Franklin, who, though but a young man, it\r\nmay be, speedily he must appear before the judgment seat of God; and\r\nwhat answer will he be able to give for printing things so vile and\r\nabominable?' In sober truth, it would be well for all those connected\r\nwith the press to bear in mind this passage from that excellent man; for\r\nwho can estimate the evil of even one lie, once put into circulation?\r\n\r\nIt was not long before Franklin was arrested by the Government, and\r\nimprisoned four weeks in the common jail, for the conduct of his paper.\r\nThe council also published an order, setting forth that Franklin had\r\npublished many passages, boldly reflecting upon the Government of the\r\nprovince, the ministry, the churches, and the college, and that it often\r\ncontained paragraphs tending to fill the readers' minds with vanity to\r\nthe dishonor of God, and the service of good men--in consequence of\r\nwhich, it was resolved that nothing should be published in the said\r\ncolony, that had not been first perused and allowed by the secretary of\r\nthe colony.\r\n\r\nThe order does not seem to have been enforced; and the first number of\r\nthe paper, after James Franklin's release, contained another essay from\r\nthe club, of increased boldness. It was headed by a sort of a text as\r\nfollows: '_And then, after they had anathematized and cursed a man to\r\nthe devil, and the devil would not, or did not, take him, then to make\r\nthe sheriff and the jailer take the devil's leavings._'\r\n\r\nOther publications, equally liberal, and equally offensive to the civil\r\nauthorities, were brought before both Houses of the General Court, and a\r\njoint committee was appointed to consider and report. This committee\r\nreported that the tendency of Franklin's paper was 'to mock religion and\r\nbring it into contempt.' They therefore recommended that James Franklin\r\nbe prohibited from publishing anything not previously examined and\r\napproved by the secretary. The recommendation was adopted, but Franklin\r\nagain disregarded the order, for which he was prosecuted for a contempt\r\nof the General Court; but the jury ignored the bill. He was, however,\r\nbound to good behavior, in conformity to the order of the General Court.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings were severely attacked in the _American Weekly\r\nMercury_, which by that time had been established in Philadelphia; and\r\nthe Assembly of the Province of Massachusetts was denounced as being\r\nmade up of oppressors and bigots, who made religion only an engine of\r\ndestruction to the people. Their public officers were proclaimed to be\r\nremarkable for their hypocrisy, raised up as 'a scourge in the hands of\r\nthe Almighty for the sins of the people.'\r\n\r\nThese attacks were undoubtedly written by the club in Boston and sent to\r\nPhiladelphia for publication. But neither the club nor James Franklin\r\nwould submit to the order of the Court; and for the purpose of evading\r\nit, the name of James was taken out of the paper, and that of Benjamin\r\nsubstituted. The latter was then a minor, and this was the first\r\nintroduction of his name into public life. But though a poor printer's\r\nlad, the name thus first used as a shield for others who were behind the\r\ncurtains, has since challenged the world for illustrious deeds of his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nWith this change of the name of the publisher, came a new prospectus,\r\nprobably the first effort of the kind, of the then youthful philosopher.\r\nThis prospectus was rather an odd one, as will be seen by the following\r\nextract: 'The main design of this weekly will be to entertain the town\r\nwith the most comical and diverting incidents of human life; which in so\r\nlarge a place as Boston will not fail of a universal exemplification.\r\nNor shall we be wanting to fill up these papers with a grateful\r\ninterspersion of more serious morals, which may be drawn from the most\r\nludicrous and odd parts of human life.'\r\n\r\nThe character of the paper, however, does not appear to have been\r\nchanged for the better by the change of names. It was continued in the\r\nname of Benjamin Franklin some time after he had left it; but the\r\nmembers of the club at length grew wearied with the labor, and the paper\r\nexpired in 1727. James Franklin then removed to Rhode Island, and\r\nestablished the first newspaper in that State, at Newport.\r\n\r\nIt remains to notice but one more of the early Boston editors, who seems\r\nto have been an odd fish--somewhat witty, but, to use a homely proverb,\r\n'as rough as a rat-catcher's dog.' He first established the _Boston\r\nWeekly Rehearsal_, in 1731, and afterward the _Boston Evening Post_. His\r\nname was Thomas Fleet. Massachusetts was then a slaveholding country,\r\nand Fleet owned several negroes, two of whom he instructed in the art of\r\nprinting. Their names were Pompey and Cæsar--the only two _Romans_, I\r\nbelieve, who ever belonged to the printing fraternity. These honest\r\nfellows lived and printed until after the war of the Revolution, having\r\nbecome freemen by the Constitution of Massachusetts of 1780. Fleet was\r\ndroll and witty in the conduct of his paper, especially in his\r\nadvertisements. Witness the following advertisement of one of his negro\r\nwomen for sale: 'To be sold, by the printer of this paper, the very best\r\nnegro woman in this town, who has had the small pox and the measles; is\r\nas hearty as a horse, as brisk as a bird, will work like a beaver.'\r\n\r\nThere was a common evil existing in those days which, it is to be\r\nfeared, has now become chronic. People were prone to omit paying for\r\ntheir newspapers. Fleet had often to complain of this crying sin, even\r\nagainst men of great religious professions. On one occasion he read them\r\nquite a severe lesson upon their injustice and oppression in this\r\nrespect. 'Every one,' says he, 'thinks he has a right to read news, but\r\nfew find themselves inclined to pay for it. 'Tis a great pity a soil\r\nthat will bear _piety_ so well, should not produce a tolerable crop of\r\ncommon honesty.'\r\n\r\nIt is, moreover, slanderously reported in the ancient chronicles, that\r\nFleet was not blessed with the most beautiful and sweet-tempered wife\r\nand daughters in Boston. On one occasion he invited a friend to dine\r\nwith him on _pouts_, a kind of fish then esteemed a great delicacy, and\r\nof which he knew his friend to be remarkably fond. His domestic matters,\r\nhowever, did not move along very smoothly that morning, and when they\r\nsat down to table, the gentleman remarked that the _pouts_ were wanting.\r\n\r\n'Oh no,' said Fleet, 'only look at my wife and daughters!'\r\n\r\nTwenty-one years elapsed from the establishment of a newspaper in\r\nBoston, before William Bradford commenced the _New York Gazette_, in\r\nOctober, 1725. It was printed on a half sheet of foolscap, with a large\r\nand almost wornout type. There is a large volume of these papers in the\r\nNew York City Library, in good preservation. The advertisements do not\r\naverage more than three or four a week, and these are mostly of runaway\r\nnegroes. The ship news was diminutive enough; now and then a ship, and\r\nsome half a dozen sloops arriving and leaving in the course of the week.\r\nSuch was the daily paper published in the commercial metropolis of the\r\nUnited States, one hundred and thirty-eight years ago!\r\n\r\nEight years after the establishment of Bradford's _Gazette_, the _New\r\nYork Weekly Journal_ was commenced by John Philip Zengar. This paper\r\nwas established for the purpose of opposing the colonial administration\r\nof Governor Crosby, under the patronage, as was supposed, of the\r\nHonorable Rip Van Dam, who had previously discharged the duties of the\r\nexecutive office, as President of the Council. The first great libel\r\nsuit tried in New York was instituted by the Government in 1734 against\r\nZengar. He was imprisoned by virtue of a warrant from the Governor and\r\nCouncil; and a concurrence of the House of Representatives in the\r\nprosecution was requested. The House, however, declined. The Governor\r\nand Council then ordered the libellous papers to be burned by the common\r\nhangman, or whipper, near the pillory. But both the common whipper and\r\nthe common hangman were officers of the corporation, not of the Crown,\r\nand they declined officiating at the illumination. The papers were\r\ntherefore burned by the sheriff's deputy at the order of the Governor.\r\nAn ineffectual attempt was next made to procure an indictment against\r\nZengar, but the grand jury refused to find a bill. The Attorney-General\r\nwas then directed to file no information against him for printing the\r\nlibels, and he was kept in prison until another term. His counsel\r\noffered exceptions to the commissions of the judges, which the latter\r\nnot only refused to hear, but excluded his counsel, Messrs. Smith and\r\nAlexander, from the bar. Zengar then obtained other counsel--John\r\nChambers, of New York, and Andrew Hamilton, of Philadelphia. The trial\r\nat length came on, and excited great interest. The truth, under the old\r\nEnglish law of libel, could never be given in evidence, and was of\r\ncourse excluded on the present trial. Hamilton nevertheless tried the\r\ncase with great ability. He showed the jury that they were the judges as\r\nwell of the law as of the fact, and Zengar was acquitted. The verdict\r\nwas received with cheers by the audience; and the corporation voted the\r\nfreedom of the city to Andrew Hamilton, 'for the remarkable service done\r\nto the inhabitants of this city and colony, by his defence of the rights\r\nof mankind and the liberty of the press.' The certificate was sent to\r\nMr. Hamilton by Mr. Stephen Bayard in a superb gold box, on the lid of\r\nwhich were engraved the arms of the city with several classical and\r\nappropriate mottoes.\r\n\r\nThus ever has power been arrayed against the liberty of the press; and\r\nthus ever have the people been ready to sustain it.\r\n\r\nSoon after the relinquishment of his paper by Bradford, it was resumed\r\nby James Parker, under the double title of _The New York Gazette and\r\nWeekly Post Boy_. In 1753, ten years afterward, Parker took a partner by\r\nthe name of William Wayman. But neither of the partners, nor both of\r\nthem together, possessed the indomitable spirit of John Philip Zengar.\r\nHaving in March, 1756, published an article reflecting upon the conduct\r\nof the people of Ulster and Orange counties, the Assembly, entertaining\r\na high regard for the majesty of the people, took offence thereat, and\r\nboth the editors were taken into custody by the sergeant-at-arms. What\r\nthe precise nature of the insult upon the sovereign people of those\r\ncounties was, does not appear. But the editors behaved in a craven\r\nmanner. They acknowledged their fault, begged pardon of the House, and\r\npaid the costs of the proceedings; in addition to all which, they gave\r\nup the name of the author. He proved to be none other than the Rev.\r\nHezekiah Watkins, a missionary to the county of Ulster, residing at\r\nNewburgh. The reverend gentleman was accordingly arrested, brought to\r\nNew York, and voted guilty of a high misdemeanor and contempt of the\r\nauthority of the House. Of what persuasion was this Mr. Watkins, does\r\nnot appear. But neither Luther, nor Calvin, nor Hugh Latimer would have\r\nbetrayed the right of free discussion as he did, by begging the pardon\r\nof the House, standing to receive a reprimand, paying the fees, and\r\npromising to be more circumspect in future, for the purpose of obtaining\r\nhis discharge.\r\n\r\nThis case affords the most singular instance of the exercise of the\r\ndoubtful power of punishing for what are called contempts, on record. A\r\ncourt has unquestionably a right to protect itself from indignity, while\r\nin session; and so has a legislative body, although the power of\r\npunishing for such an offence, without trial by jury, is now gravely\r\nquestioned. But for a legislative body to extend the mantle of its\r\nprotection over its constituency in such a matter, is an exercise of\r\npower of which it is difficult to find a parallel. Sure it is that a\r\npeople, then or now, who would elect such members to the Legislature\r\ndeserve nothing else than contempt.\r\n\r\nThe fourth paper established in New York was called the _Evening Post_.\r\nIt was commenced by Henry De Forest in 1746. It was remarkable chiefly\r\nfor stupidity, looseness of grammar, and worse orthography, and died\r\nbefore it was able to go alone.\r\n\r\nIn 1752 the _New York Mercury_ was commenced, and in 1763 the title was\r\nchanged to the _New York Gazette and Weekly Mercury_. This paper was\r\nestablished and published by Hugh Gaine, at the sign of the Bible and\r\nCrown, Hanover square. It was conducted with taste and ability, and\r\nbecame the best newspaper in the Colonies. In 1763, Gaine was arraigned\r\nby the Assembly for publishing a part of its proceedings without\r\npermission, and withal incorrectly. He was a gentleman of a kind spirit,\r\nand never had the power to withhold an apology when it was asked. He\r\naccordingly apologized, was reprimanded, and discharged.\r\n\r\nAs the storm of war drew on in 1775, the _Mercury_ contained a series of\r\npatriotic papers, under the signature of the Watch Tower. But as the\r\nBritish forces drew near to New York, the patriotism of Gaine began to\r\ncool; and during the whole course of the Revolutionary war, his\r\n_Mercury_ afforded very accurate indications of the state of the\r\ncontest. When with the Whigs, Hugh Gaine was a Whig. When with the\r\nRoyalists, he was loyal. When the contest was doubtful, equally doubtful\r\nwere the politics of Hugh Gaine. In short, he was the most perfect\r\npattern of the genuine non-committal. On the arrival of the British army\r\nhe removed to Newark for a while; but soon returned to the city and\r\npublished a paper devoted to the cause of the Crown. His course was a\r\nfruitful theme for the wags of the day; and at the peace, a poetical\r\npetition from Gaine to the Senate of the State, setting forth his life\r\nand conduct, was got up with a good deal of talent and humor. His paper\r\nceased with the war.\r\n\r\nAnother paper, called the _New York Gazette_, was commenced by Wayman,\r\nthe former associate of Parker. In 1766, Wayman was arrested for a\r\ncontempt of the Assembly, upon no other charge than that of two\r\ntypographical errors in printing the speech of Sir Henry Moore, the\r\nGovernor of the Colony. One of these errors consisted in printing the\r\nword NEVER for _ever_; and the other was the omission of the word NO, by\r\nreason of which the meaning of the sentence was reversed. Wayman\r\nprotested that it was a mere inadvertency; but so tenacious were\r\nlegislators in those days of 'privilege,' that an investigation was\r\ninstituted; but in the end the transgressor was discharged from 'durance\r\nvile,' on condition of acknowledging his fault, asking pardon, and\r\npromising to behave more circumspectly for the future.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly, however, was more rigid in this case, from the suspicion\r\nentertained that one of the errors was intentional; but such was clearly\r\nnot the fact.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more annoying to authors and publishers than errors of\r\nthe press; and yet those who are unskilled in the art of printing, can\r\nscarcely conceive the difficulty of avoiding them. The art of proof\r\nreading with perfect accuracy is an high and difficult attainment. To\r\narrive at ordinary accuracy in a daily newspaper, requires the reading\r\nand correction of at least two proofs; and even then an editor, who has\r\nnot become case hardened, by long practice and long endurance, will\r\noften be shocked at the transformation of sense into nonsense, or the\r\nmurdering of one of his happiest conceits, or the plucking of the point\r\nout of one of his neatest paragraphs, by a typographical error.\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of the art of printing, typographical errors were\r\nfar more numerous than in books of modern execution, where there is a\r\nreal effort to attain to ordinary accuracy. It was then very common for\r\na volume of ordinary size to contain page upon page of _errata_ at the\r\nclose. One of the most remarkable instances of this kind was the curious\r\ntreatise of Edward Leigh, 'On Religion and Learning,' published in 1656.\r\nAt the close of the work were two folio pages of corrections in very\r\nminute characters. The author himself complains as follows: 'We have no\r\nPlantier or Stevens (two celebrated printers of another day) amongst us;\r\nand it is no easy task to specify the chiefest _errata_; false\r\ninterpunctions there are too many; here a letter wanting, there a letter\r\ntoo much; a syllable too much, one letter for another; words joined,\r\nwhich should be severed; words misplaced, chronological mistakes, &c.'\r\n\r\nLeigh's case, however, was not so hard as that of a monk, who wrote and\r\npublished the 'Anatomy of the Mass,' in 1561. The work itself contained\r\nonly one hundred and seventy-two pages, to which were added FIFTEEN\r\npages of _errata_. The pious monk wrote an apology for these\r\ninaccuracies, which, if true, proved that his case was indeed a cruel\r\none--clearly proving, moreover, that even if the devil had originally\r\nassisted Doctor Faustus and Gutenberg in the invention, his brimstone\r\nmajesty very soon became sick of his bargain. The monk avers that he\r\nwrote the work to circumvent the artifices of Satan, and that the devil,\r\never on the alert, undertook to circumvent him. For this purpose Satan,\r\nin the first place, caused the MS. to be drenched in a kennel, until it\r\nwas rendered comparatively illegible; and, in the second place, he\r\ncompelled the printers to perpetrate more typographical blunders than\r\nhad ever before been made in a book of no greater magnitude. But the\r\nmalice of Lucifer did not end here. He compelled the priest to act under\r\nhis influence while making the corrections!\r\n\r\nBut they were not all unintentional errors of the press in those days\r\nthat appeared such. There were words and phrases interdicted by the Pope\r\nand the Inquisition; and sometimes by adroit management the interdicted\r\nword, though not inserted in the text, could be arrived at in the table\r\nof _errata_.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact, that the edition of the Latin Vulgate, by Pope\r\nSixtus the Fifth, although his Holiness carefully superintended every\r\nsheet as it passed through the press, has ever remained without a rival\r\nin typographical inaccuracy. Still more curious was the fact, that the\r\nPope, in the plenitude of pontifical infallibility, prefixed to the\r\nfirst volume a bull of excommunication against any and every printer,\r\nwho in reprinting the work, should ever make any alteration in the text.\r\nTo the amazement of the public, however, when the Bible appeared, it\r\nswarmed with errors too numerous for an errata. In a multitude of\r\ninstances it was necessary to reprint whole passages in scraps, and\r\npaste over the incorrect verses. Great efforts were made to call in the\r\nedition; and it is now only to be found among rare collections, as a\r\nmonument of literary blunders. If the Devil ever troubles himself about\r\nthe correction of proofsheets, he was much more likely to be standing at\r\nthe Pope's elbow while the Bible was printing, than to be bothering his\r\nhead in regard to the poor monk's mass book to which allusion has been\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nTypographical errors happen in a variety of ways; sometimes by\r\ncarelessness, sometimes by the ignorance and stupidity of the printer,\r\nand sometimes by design. Occurring in either way, they are often\r\nludicrous, and sometimes productive of positive evil. A few examples of\r\neach variety will suffice.\r\n\r\nIn the fine description of the Pantheon, by Akenside, the expressive\r\nphrase 'SEVERELY great,' not being understood by the printer, who\r\nundertook to think for himself, was printed '_serenely_ great.'\r\n\r\nAn edition of the Bible was once published in England, in which the word\r\n_not_ was omitted in the seventh commandment. For this offence, whether\r\nby carelessness or by design, the archbishop imposed the heaviest\r\npenalty ever recorded in the annals of literary history. The edition was\r\nrequired to be called in and destroyed, and a fine imposed of £20,000\r\nsterling.\r\n\r\nThere was a more severe punishment than even this awarded in Germany\r\nonce, for a wilful alteration of the sacred text. It seems that in Gen.\r\niii. 16, the Hebrew word which has been rendered _husband_ in the\r\nEnglish translation, is _lord_ in the German. It is the passage in which\r\nGod tells Eve: 'And thy desire shall be to thy husband, who shall rule\r\nover thee.' The German word signifying lord is HERR; and in the same\r\nlanguage the word NARR answers for fool. The case was this: A new\r\nedition of the Bible was printing at the house of a widow, whose husband\r\nhad been a printer. The spirited lady, not liking the subordinate\r\nstation of her sex, and having acquired a little knowledge of the art,\r\nwatched an opportunity by night to enter the printing office; and while\r\nthe form was lying on the press, she carefully drew out the letters _H_\r\nand _e_, and inserted in their stead the letters _Na_. The outrage was\r\nnot discovered in season, and the Bible went forth declaring that man\r\nshould be the woman's fool. Such, probably, is too often the case, but\r\nthe gentlemen would not like to see it in print. Gravely, however, the\r\nperson committing such an offence must needs stand in awful apprehension\r\nof the fearful curse denounced in the conclusion of the Apocalypse.\r\n\r\nAn edition of the _Catholic Missal_ was once published in France, in\r\nwhich the accidental substitution merely of the letter _u_ for an _a_,\r\nwas the cause of a shocking blunder, changing, as it did, the word\r\n_calotte_ (an ecclesiastical cap or mitre) into _culotte_, which, as my\r\nreaders are aware, means, in drawing-room English, a gentleman's small\r\nclothes. The error occurred in one of the directions for conducting the\r\nservice, where it is said: \"Here the priest will take off his\r\n_culotte_!\"\r\n\r\nAmong the errors that have occurred through design, was one which\r\nhappened in the old _Hudson Balance_, when the Rev. Dr. Croswell was the\r\neditor of that ancient and excellent journal. A merchant by the name of\r\nPeter Cole chanced to get married. Cole, however, was very unpopular,\r\nand was not one of the brightest intelligences even of those days. The\r\nbride, too, was a little more no than yes, in her intellectual\r\nfurnishment. It used to be a common practice in the country, in sending\r\nmarriages to the press, to tack on a bit of poetry in the shape of some\r\nsweet hymenial sentimentality. In compliance with this custom, the\r\ngroomsman added a line or two from one of the poets, where the bard\r\nspeaks of the bliss of the marriage state, 'when _heart_ meets _heart_\r\nreciprocally soft.' The wicked boys in the printing office, however,\r\ncorrected the poet, making the stanza read thus:\r\n\r\n   'When _head_ meets _head_, reciprocally soft.'\r\n\r\nAnother instance, more ludicrous still, was the following: A lad in a\r\nprinting office, who knew more about type setting than he did of the\r\nGreek mythology, in looking over a poem they were printing, came upon\r\nthe name of _Hecate_, one of the lady divinities of the lower world,\r\noccurring in a line like this:\r\n\r\n   'Shall reign the _Hecate_ of the deepest hell.'\r\n\r\nThe boy, thinking he had discovered an error, ran to the master printer,\r\nand inquired eagerly whether there was an _e_ in cat. 'Why, no, you\r\nblockhead,' was the reply. Away went the boy to the press room, and\r\nextracted the objectionable letter. But fancy the horror of both poet\r\nand publisher, when the poem appeared with the line:\r\n\r\n   'Shall reign the HE CAT of the deepest hell.'\r\n\r\nBut let a form of types, arranged either for book or newspaper, be ever\r\nso correct when sent to the press, errors not unfrequently happen from\r\nyet another cause, viz.: the liability of now and then a letter to drop\r\nout, when the form has not been properly adjusted, or locked\r\nsufficiently tight in the iron frame which by printers is called a\r\n_chase_. How important the loss of a single letter may become is seen by\r\nthe following example. A printer putting to press a form of the Common\r\nPrayer, the _c_ in the following passage dropped out unperceived by him:\r\n'We shall all be CHANGED in the twinkling of an eye.' When the book\r\nappeared, to the horror of the devout worshipper, the passage read: 'We\r\nshall all be HANGED in the twinkling of an eye.'\r\n\r\nSometimes a whole page or a whole form drops through, and falls into\r\nwhat printers call _pi_--that is, a mass of all sorts of letters, stops,\r\nmarks, points, spaces, forming a jumble of everything--and involving the\r\ndire necessity of assorting over the whole mass, letter by letter. In\r\nisolated printing houses, where they have but few workmen, and\r\nassistance is not near, such a catastrophe is a serious matter. An\r\ninstance of this kind, which happened many years ago in the county of\r\nOneida, is in point. An editor was putting his paper to press (for in\r\nthe country, editor and printer are often combined) when down fell his\r\nform--a wreck of matter and a crush of words. There was no other\r\nprinting office nearer than Albany, and it was impossible for him to\r\nrearrange his types for the paper that week. But his paper must come out\r\nat all hazards, on account of the legal advertisements on the first\r\nside. He therefore hit upon the expedient of publishing his paper with a\r\nblank page, inserting in large letters, '_Omitted for want of room_!'\r\n\r\nBut, after all, when it is considered of how many separate and minute\r\npieces of metal a book form or the page of a newspaper is composed, the\r\nwonder is that errors of the press are not far more numerous than they\r\nare. A single page of one of our largest papers cannot contain less than\r\n150,000 separate pieces of metal, each of which must be nicely adjusted\r\nin its own proper place, or error and confusion will ensue.\r\n\r\nBut to return from this long digression of the early newspaper press of\r\nNew York. A paper called the _New York Chronicle_ was published during\r\nthe years 1761-'62, and then died. The _New York Pacquet_ was next\r\npublished, in 1763, but how long it lived is not known. In 1766, Holt\r\nestablished the _New York Journal, or General Advertiser_, which in the\r\ncourse of the year was connected with Parker's _Gazette_, the _Journal_,\r\nhowever, being printed as a separate paper. John Holt edited the first\r\nWhig paper published in New York; nor, as in the case of Hugh Gaine, did\r\nhis patriotism come and go as danger approached or receded from the\r\ncity. In 1774, Holt discarded the King's arms, and took that engraving\r\nfrom the title of his paper, substituting in place of it, a serpent cut\r\nin pieces, with the expressive motto, 'Unite or Die.' In January, 1775,\r\nthe snake was united and coiled, with the tail in its mouth, forming a\r\ndouble ring: within the coil was a pillar standing on Magna Charta and\r\nsurmounted with the cap of liberty: the pillar on each side was\r\nsupported by six arms and hands, figurative of the colonies. On the\r\nbody of the snake, beginning at the head, were the following lines:\r\n\r\n     'United now, alive and free,\r\n   Firm on this basis Liberty shall stand;\r\n   And thus supported, ever bless our land,\r\n      Till Time becomes Eternity.'\r\n\r\nThe designs both of 1774 and 1775 were excellent--the first, by a\r\nvisible illustration, showing the disjointed state of the colonies; and\r\nthe second presenting an emblem of their strength when united. Holt\r\nmaintained his integrity to the last. When the British troops took\r\npossession of New York, he removed to Esopus, now Kingston, and revived\r\nhis paper. On the burning of that village by the enemy in 1777, he\r\nremoved to Poughkeepsie, and published the _Journal_ there until the\r\npeace of 1783, when he returned to New York and resumed his paper under\r\nthe title of _The Independent Gazette; or, The New York Journal\r\nRevived_. Holt was an unflinching patriot, but did not long survive the\r\nachievement of his country's freedom. In 1784 he gave his paper a new\r\ntypographical dress, and commenced publishing it twice a week, being the\r\nsecond paper thus frequently published in the United States. He died,\r\nhowever, early in that year. The _Journal_ was continued for a time by\r\nthe widow; but after undergoing several changes of name and\r\nproprietorship, it passed into the hands of Francis Greenleaf in 1787,\r\nby whom it was converted into a daily paper, called the _Argus, or\r\nGreenleaf's New Daily Advertiser_. A semi-weekly paper was also\r\npublished by Greenleaf, called the _New York Journal and Patriotic\r\nRegister_. Mr. Greenleaf was a practical printer and an estimable and\r\nenterprising man. He fell a victim to the yellow fever in 1798. The\r\npaper was continued by his widow for a little while, but ultimately fell\r\ninto the hands of that celebrated political gladiator, James Cheetham.\r\n\r\nThe _Independent Reflector_ was a paper commenced by James Parker in\r\n1752, and continued for two years. Among its contributors were Governor\r\nLivingston, the Rev. Aaron Burr (father of the distinguished and unhappy\r\nstatesman of that name), William Alexander (afterward Lord Stirling),\r\nand William Smith, the historian of New York. The tone of the paper was\r\nunsuited to the ears of the men in power: it was free and fearless in\r\nits discussions; and means were found to silence it. The belief was that\r\nParker was suborned to refuse longer to publish it.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated James Rivington began his paper, under the formidable\r\ntitle of _Rivington's New York Gazette; or, The Connecticut, New Jersey,\r\nHudson's River, and Quebec Weekly Advertiser_, in 1733. The imprint read\r\nas follows: 'Printed at his _ever open_ and uninfluenced press, fronting\r\nHanover Square.' It is well known that Rivington was the royal printer\r\nduring the whole of the Revolutionary War; and it is amusing to trace\r\nthe degrees by which his toryism manifested itself as the storm gathered\r\nover the country. The title of the paper originally contained a cut of a\r\nlarge ship under sail. In 1774, the ship sailed out of sight, and the\r\nKing's arms appeared in its place; and in 1775 the words _ever open and\r\nuninfluenced_ were withdrawn from the imprint. These symptoms were\r\ndisliked by the patriots of the country, and in November, 1775, a party\r\nof armed men from Connecticut entered the city on horseback, beset his\r\nhabitation, broke into his printing office, destroyed his presses, and\r\nthrew his types into _pi_. They then carried them away, melted, and cast\r\nthem into bullets. Rivington's paper was now effectually\r\nstopped--'omitted for want of room'--until the British army took\r\npossession of the city. Rivington himself meantime had been to England,\r\nwhere he procured a new printing apparatus, and returning, established\r\n'_The New York Royal Gazette_, published by James Rivington, printer to\r\nthe King's most excellent Majesty.' During the remaining five years of\r\nthe war, Rivington's paper was the most distinguished for its lies, and\r\nits loyalty, of any other journal in America. It was published twice a\r\nweek; and four other newspapers were published in New York, at the same\r\ntime, under the sanction of the British officers--one arranged for each\r\nday, so that, in fact, they had the advantages of a daily paper. It has\r\nbeen said, and believed, that Rivington, after all, was a secret traitor\r\nto the crown, and, in fact, the secret informant of Washington. Be this,\r\nhowever, as it may, as the war drew to a close, and the prospects of the\r\nKing's arms began to darken, Rivington's loyalty began to cool down; and\r\nby 1787 the King's arms had disappeared and the title of the paper, no\r\nmore the _Royal Gazette_, was simply _Rivington's New York Gazette and\r\nUniversal Advertiser_. But although he labored to play the republican,\r\nhe was distrusted by the people, and his paper was relinquished in the\r\ncourse of that year.\r\n\r\nIn 1775, Samuel Loudon commenced his _New York Pacquet and American\r\nAdvertiser_. When New York fell into the hands of the enemy, Loudon\r\nremoved to Fishkill, and published his paper there. At the close of the\r\nwar he returned to the city, and began a daily paper, which was\r\ncontinued many years.\r\n\r\nWe have thus sketched the history of printing, and of the newspaper\r\npress in Boston and New York, from the introduction of the art, down to\r\nthe period of the Revolution. From these brief sketches, an idea may be\r\nformed of the germ of the newspaper press which is now one of the chief\r\nglories of our country. The public press of no other country equals that\r\nof the United States, either on the score of its moral or its\r\nintellectual power, or for the exertion of that manly independence of\r\nthought and action, which ought to characterize the press of a free\r\npeople. What a prophet would the great wizard novelist of Scotland have\r\nbeen, had the prediction which he put into the mouth of Galeotti\r\nMartivalle, the astrologer of Louis the Eleventh, in the romance of\r\nQuentin Durward, been written at the period of its date! Louis, who has\r\njustly been held as the Tiberius of France, is represented as paying a\r\nvisit to the mystic workshop of the astrologer, whom his Majesty\r\ndiscovered to be engaged in the then newly invented art of multiplying\r\nmanuscripts by the intervention of machinery--in other words, the\r\napparatus of printing.\r\n\r\n'Can things of such mechanical and terrestrial import,' inquired the\r\nking, 'interest the thoughts of one before whom Heaven has unrolled her\r\nown celestial volumes?'\r\n\r\n'My brother,' replied the astrologer, 'believe me, that in considering\r\nthe consequences of this invention, I read with as certain augury, as by\r\nany combination of the heavenly bodies, the most awful and portentous\r\nchanges. When I reflect with what slow and limited supplies the stream\r\nof science hath hitherto descended to us; how difficult to be obtained\r\nby those most ardent in its search; how certain to be neglected by all\r\nwho love their ease; how liable to be diverted or altogether dried up,\r\nby the invasions of barbarisms; can I look forward without wonder and\r\nastonishment, to the lot of a succeeding generation, on whom knowledge\r\nwill descend like the first and second rain, uninterrupted, unabated,\r\nunbounded; fertilizing some grounds, and overflowing others; changing\r\nthe whole form of social life; establishing and overthrowing religions;\r\nerecting and destroying kingdoms--'\r\n\r\n'Hold, hold, Galeotti,' cried the king, 'shall these changes come in our\r\ntime?'\r\n\r\n'No, my royal brother,' replied Martivalle; 'this invention may be\r\nlikened to a young tree, which is now newly planted, but shall, in\r\nsucceeding generations, bear fruit as fatal, yet as precious, as that of\r\nthe Garden of Eden; the knowledge, namely, of good and evil.'\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: For the benefit of the curious reader, I would state that a\r\nperfect file of the _Boston News Letter_ is still preserved in the\r\nWorcester Historical Library. There is also an imperfect file in the New\r\nYork Historical Society Library.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECONNOISSANCE NEAR FORT MORGAN,\r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\nEXPEDITION IN LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN AND PEARL RIVER, BY THE MORTAR FLOTILLA\r\nOF CAPTAIN D. D. PORTER, U. S. N.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a former article, on the surrender of Forts Jackson and St. Philip,\r\nwhich appeared in the May number of THE CONTINENTAL MONTHLY, allusion\r\nwas made to the efficiency of the mortar flotilla, to which the Coast\r\nSurvey party, under charge of Assistant F. H. Gerdes, was attached, by\r\nspecial direction of Flag-officer D. G. Farragut. This party rendered\r\nhydrographic and also naval service, where such was required, their\r\nsteamer, the Sachem, being used by the commander of the flotilla like\r\nany other vessel under his command. Captain Porter, in his letters to\r\nthe Superintendent of the Coast Survey, writes, under date of April 29,\r\n1862: \"Mr. Gerdes no doubt has written to you and sent you plans. I keep\r\nhim pretty hard at work. The times require it,\" &c.\r\n\r\n_May 16th_.--\"I have not spared the Sachem, but treated her like the\r\nrest of the vessels, putting her under fire when it was necessary. I\r\nlook upon the Sachem in the same light as I would upon a topographical\r\nparty in the army, and if I lose her in such employment, she will have\r\npaid well for herself.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the surrender of the Mississippi forts, the mortar fleet met at\r\nShip Island, and the Sachem being directed to join it, arrived there on\r\nthe 7th of May. Under instructions from the commander, the steamer\r\ndivision of the flotilla stood out for Mobile bar on the 8th, and came\r\nto anchor the same evening under the lee of Sand Key, viz.:\r\n\r\n   _Harriet Lane_, Com. J. M. WAINWRIGHT, flagship\r\n   _Westfield_, Commander W. B. RENSHAW.\r\n   _Owasco_, Commander JOHN GUEST.\r\n   _Clifton_, Lieut. Com. CHARLES BALDWIN.\r\n   _Jackson_, Lieut. Com. S. WOODWORTH.\r\n   _Sachem_, As't U.S. Coast Survey, F. H. GERDES.\r\n\r\nIt was Captain Porter's design to assemble his mortar vessels, which had\r\nstarted the day previous from Ship Island, at the outer bar of Mobile\r\nBay. He intended then to cross the bar on their arrival, and to come to\r\nanchor inside at given distances, for the bombardment of Forts Morgan\r\nand Gaines. Those distances were to be ascertained and minutely\r\ndetermined by the Coast Survey party. Unfortunately a very severe\r\nnortheast storm had been raging for a day or two, which made all headway\r\nfor sailing vessels impossible, sweeping most of them far out to sea.\r\nThe commander directed the Coast Survey party to sound the bar, and to\r\nplant buoys at the extreme points of the shoals. Messrs. Oltmanns and\r\nHarris, each in a separate boat, were sent to perform this duty, and\r\naccomplished it by 10 o'clock A. M. The steamer Clifton accompanied the\r\nCoast Survey boats for protection, and was running up and down while the\r\nspar buoys were planted on the east and west spit, but, caught by the\r\ncurrent, she drifted too close to the east bank inside the bar, and\r\ngrounded hard and fast, just when the attempt was made to bring her\r\nround. The tide at that time was ebbing. All efforts to clear her were\r\nunsuccessful, and even the powerful steamer Jackson, which was sent to\r\nher relief by the commander, had to give up the attempt and leave her\r\nexposed to the fire of Fort Morgan. The enemy opened on her directly\r\nafter she grounded, and some of the shot and shell from the fort struck\r\nwithin twenty yards of her bows. Captain Porter then suggested her\r\nrelief by the Sachem, which, on account of her light draft, might\r\napproach nearer than the Jackson. After clearing her screw, which had\r\ngot entangled by some hanging gear, the Sachem got under way, and was\r\nanchored alongside and to the southward of the Clifton just before dusk.\r\nShe let go both her heavy anchors, to prevent any dragging from the\r\ngreat strain that must naturally result from an effort to haul off the\r\ngrounded steamer. A nine-inch hawser was sent to her, one end of the\r\nhawser being made fast to the Sachem. The tide had begun to rise by this\r\ntime, and fortunately at the first strain on the hawser the Clifton\r\nfloated, and was quickly drawn alongside of the Sachem. There was no\r\ntime to spare, as the shell and shot from the fort fell very thick; the\r\nClifton therefore got up steam at once, and moved out of range. The\r\nSachem remained to get up her anchors which had been slipped, and was so\r\nengaged until 10 o'clock P. M., when she came to alongside of the\r\nHarriet Lane. Captain Porter, as well as Captain Baldwin, expressed\r\ngreat satisfaction with the cheerful readiness and seamanship which were\r\nshown by the party on the Sachem.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of May, at sunrise, it blew a gale from the east, and as\r\nthere appeared no chance whatever for the mortar schooners to reach\r\nMobile bar, Captain Porter signalled the steam division to return to\r\nShip Island. The Sachem was the second vessel under way, and although\r\ncomparatively slow, she had now the advantage of a full suit of sails.\r\nEarly in the evening all the steamers were at anchor again at Ship\r\nIsland Spit. In the night, between the 11th and 12th of May, the Harriet\r\nLane returned with the commander, who had been in the mean time to\r\nPensacola, and had there taken possession of Fort McRea, the navy yard,\r\nand the city, all of which were evacuated a few days previous. Captain\r\nPorter at first intended to send Assistant Gerdes, with the Sachem, to\r\nPensacola, to replace the buoys and beacons which had been destroyed by\r\nthe enemy. It was afterward decided that the party should accompany\r\nseveral of the steamers on an expedition in Lake Pontchartrain and the\r\nPearl river, and in consideration of the light draft of the Coast Survey\r\nsteamer, and the local information possessed by her officers, he\r\ndirected that the Sachem should take the lead, and be closely followed\r\nby the Westfield, the Clifton, and the Jackson. Early in the morning of\r\nthe 13th of May, he made signal from the flag ship for the division to\r\nstart, and at 6 A. M. the steamers were abreast of Cat Island. The\r\nSachem took them safely over the extensive flats, and although there\r\nwere at times not more than six inches of water to spare, neither of the\r\nvessels ever touched the bottom. In the vicinity of Grand Island, a\r\nvessel was seen by the lookout, and on reporting to the senior officer\r\nof the expedition, Captain W. B. Renshaw, he directed the Sachem to give\r\nchase. A gun soon brought her to, and Mr. Harris was sent on board of\r\nher, where, on examination, he found no name, no ensign, no papers, in\r\nshort, nothing but several men. The vessel was taken in tow, and\r\ndelivered to Captain Renshaw, who despatched her to Ship Island. The\r\nsteamers got under way again and steamed through the Rigolets, passing\r\nFort Pike, which was then garrisoned by national troops. After entering\r\nLake Pontchartrain in the evening, a steamer was seen some five or six\r\nmiles distant, and the commanding officer, having ascertained from the\r\nCoast Survey party the sufficient depth thereabout in the lake, ordered\r\nthe Clifton to follow the Sachem. At half past six P. M. a schooner was\r\nbrought to by the leading vessel, and fifteen minutes later, another.\r\nBoth were boarded by Messrs. Oltmanns and Harris, and found to be\r\ntrading vessels with passports from General Butler. When the steamers\r\npassed the town of Mandeville, the inhabitants hoisted a large white\r\nflag high above the trees; having, probably, no American ensign. After\r\ncommunicating with the United States gunboat New London, all four\r\nvessels came to anchor at the Chifuncte river. It was ascertained that\r\nthe New London was engaged in ferreting out the enemy's vessels in that\r\nriver, and therefore Captain Renshaw determined to start next morning\r\nfor the Pearl river, which he intended to examine. At five o'clock A. M.\r\non the 14th of May, the division got under way, led as on the day before\r\nby the Sachem. At ten o'clock, the Jackson, getting out of range,\r\ngrounded and signalized for assistance. The Sachem was ordered to her\r\nrelief; but in the mean time, the Coast Survey party had furnished\r\ninformation such as would bring the other steamers safely to the mouth\r\nof Pearl river, by keeping along the southern bank in the Rigolets. When\r\nthe Sachem came up with the Jackson, her captain informed Mr. Gerdes\r\nthat as the transport boat Whiteman (a prize) was expected to pass soon,\r\nshe would be expected to lighten and tow the steamer off. The Sachem\r\ntherefore moved on, and reached the Westfield and Clifton at ten\r\no'clock, at anchor near the mouth of Pearl river.\r\n\r\nA row of stockades had been set by the enemy quite across that river,\r\nleaving only an opening for vessels to pass up and down. This\r\nobstruction consisted of heavy pieces of timber inserted vertically in\r\nthe mud bed, and joined by cross pieces, to which were chained a number\r\nof logs so as to float off at right angles. The length extended about\r\nthree quarters of a mile, and vessels could pass only through the\r\nopening, and under the fire of the guns, when Fort Pike was held by the\r\nenemy. The expediency of this device is somewhat questionable, as it\r\nplainly designated the otherwise intricate channel, and might have\r\nenabled a swift steamer to run the batteries without danger of being\r\ndetained on the extensive mud flats.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock on the morning of the 15th of May, the three steamers\r\nweighed anchor, and stood up Pearl river, the Westfield and the Clifton\r\nfollowing in the wake of the Sachem. At eleven o'clock, Pearlington was\r\nreached, a straggling village. Here two schooners and a small steamer\r\n(the William Hancock) were found, and boarded by Mr. Harris of the\r\nSachem; but when it was proved that they had not been engaged in aiding\r\nthe rebel cause, they were not further molested. The steamers of the\r\nmortar flotilla ascended the river about thirteen miles above\r\nPearlington, when the stream became quite narrow, and the turns so\r\nabrupt, that further progress for the larger boats seemed to be\r\nimpracticable. Captains Renshaw and Baldwin therefore anchored their\r\nvessels, and went on board of the Sachem, which, on account of her\r\nlighter draught and less beam, could ascend higher, and was besides\r\neasier to manage. While pushing on with her, it was frequently necessary\r\nto fasten her stern to the trees, and to tow her bow around at the very\r\nabrupt turns in the river. Within three miles of Gainesville, where the\r\nstream became extremely narrow and crooked, with the shores on both\r\nsides thickly wooded, the Sachem encountered a very sudden ambuscade,\r\nand received a heavy fire of musketry from the eastern bank. This was\r\nimmediately returned from the vessel by some sixty rifle and musket\r\nshots, and discharges of small arms were continued in rapid succession\r\nfrom both sides for some time. The executive officer of the Sachem, Mr.\r\nJ. G. Oltmanns, of the United States Coast Survey, while on the\r\nforecastle directing the crew, was dangerously wounded by a rifle ball\r\nin the breast, and fell. He was at once removed to the cabin, and Acting\r\nAssistant Harris directed to take his place. This he did instantly, and\r\nremained in that position during the whole of the subsequent cruise. As\r\nsoon as the long guns of the Sachem and the Parrott rifle 20-pounder\r\ncould be brought to bear, the thicket was cleared by discharges of\r\ncanister and grape, and the fire of the enemy was silenced. No other\r\ncasualties occurred on board of the steamer, but many of the crew\r\nnarrowly escaped harm, particularly those who were near the wheel house.\r\nThe sailing master and the steersman had their clothes pierced by\r\nbullets, and the sides and decks of the steamer were similarly marked in\r\nmany places. The river, becoming still narrower and more crooked above\r\nGainesville, it was found entirely impossible to force the Sachem higher\r\nup. Captain Renshaw therefore directed her to be turned down stream. In\r\nthis manoeuvre, much difficulty was encountered. It succeeded only by\r\ncutting the overhanging trees on shore, then backing her into the bank,\r\nfastening her stern, and towing her bow around with the boats. While\r\nturning thus, one of the Sachem's boats and the Clifton's gig were\r\nsmashed in the floating logs, and the flagstaff was carried away by\r\nhanging branches of the forest. The national ensign, however, was set on\r\nthe main, and the steamer got finally clear, and stood down the river to\r\nrejoin the Westfield and the Clifton. On coming alongside, Mr. Oltmanns\r\nwas at once transferred, by the kind suggestion of Captain Baldwin, to\r\nthe Clifton, and being made as comfortable as circumstances admitted,\r\nwas put under care of Dr. Nestell, the surgeon of the boat. The\r\nwarm-hearted commander of that vessel will always retain the sincere\r\ngratitude of every member of the Coast Survey party for his endeavors in\r\nbehalf of their brave associate. The doctor probed the wound of Mr.\r\nOltmanns, but was unable to discover the ball, which, by the by, was\r\nextracted six months later, by Dr. Lieberman, in Washington City, after\r\nit had gradually moved from the breast to the right shoulder blade. Dr.\r\nNestell had no great hopes at the time he took charge of the wounded\r\nofficer, but thought that with proper care and attention, it might be\r\npossible for him to recover. At eight o'clock P. M. the vessels anchored\r\nin Lake Borgne, and the next morning, the 16th of May, the whole\r\nexpedition returned to Ship Island. Captain (now Admiral) Porter visited\r\nMr. Oltmanns, and made suitable arrangements at once for his removal to\r\nhis friends in New York in the spacious and comfortable steamer Baltic,\r\nCaptain Comstock.\r\n\r\nBetween the 16th and 22d of May, the boilers of the Sachem were cleaned,\r\nand some repairs made in her machinery, at the end of which time Mr.\r\nGerdes was directed by the commander to repair to the Southwest Pass of\r\nthe Mississippi, and there to replace the missing buoys and stakes, and\r\nto survey the entrance.\r\n\r\nLeaving Ship Island on the 22d of May, the Sachem entered the Pass à\r\nl'Outre mouth of the Mississippi, and reached Fort Jackson on the 23d in\r\nthe evening. Here the can buoys and five or six anchors and chains which\r\nhad been removed by the confederates were found, and brought down and\r\nreplaced by the Sachem in their original locations at the Southwest\r\nPass. This important inlet of the Mississippi, at present the most\r\naccessible and best, was surveyed, a manuscript chart was made by the\r\nofficers of the Coast Survey, and copies of the same were sent at once\r\nto Flag-officer Farragut, Captain Porter, Major-General Butler, and to\r\nthe Coast Survey office in Washington; at the latter place the chart was\r\nlithographed immediately, and extensively distributed in New York and\r\nNew Orleans.\r\n\r\nWhen Flag-officer Farragut directed Captain Porter to ascend the\r\nMississippi with his mortar flotilla as far up as Vicksburg, the party\r\nin the Sachem was again called for. The vessel got under way on the 8th\r\nof June, in charge of Acting Assistant Joseph E. Harris, to whom Mr.\r\nGerdes had transferred the command, but unfortunately a few hours after\r\nstarting she broke her shaft by striking a snag, and was entirely\r\ndisabled, until extensively repaired. She was towed from Baton Rouge,\r\nwhere the accident happened, to New Orleans, and there turned over to\r\nCaptain Morris, of the U. S. Navy, commanding the sloop of war\r\nPensacola. The officers and the crew of the Sachem were returned to New\r\nYork in a U. S. transport steamer. Thus ended the expedition of the\r\nCoast Survey party attached in 1862 to the mortar flotilla.\r\n\r\nThe intercourse and association of the navy officers with the officers\r\nof the Coast Survey during the eventful days of the siege of Fort\r\nJackson, the reconnoissance to Mobile, the expedition in Lake\r\nPontchartrain and Pearl river, up to the time the Sachem was disabled\r\nfrom further participation in the operations of that campaign, had\r\ncemented warm feelings of attachment and sincere friendship, and it was\r\nwith a heavy heart the writer of these lines bade farewell to his\r\nhonored commander and friend of twenty years standing, and to his other\r\nassociates in the dangers and triumphs of that ever memorable campaign.\r\n\r\nPorter now pursues his glorious career as rear admiral of the national\r\nnavy, and his name has been since, and will be forever identified with\r\nVicksburg, Arkansas Post, Red river, and Grand Gulf. Commanders Richard\r\nWainwright, of the Hartford; Jonathan Wainwright, of the Harriet Lane;\r\nW. B. Renshaw, of the Westfield, and Lieutenant Lee, also of the Harriet\r\nLane, have passed away from their friends and associates, consecrating\r\ntheir lives gloriously in our country's cause, but deplored and lamented\r\nby their friends. Mr. Oltmanns recovered slowly from his wound, and has\r\nserved since on topographical duty for the Army of the Potomac. He is\r\nnow with the Engineer Department of General Banks in Louisiana, where he\r\nhas proved very useful, and so far eminently successful. Mr. Harris, who\r\nis esteemed and appreciated by the officers of the navy and of the Coast\r\nSurvey, has gone back to his legitimate occupation in the office of the\r\nNorthwestern Boundary. Messrs. Halter and Bowie remain in the Coast\r\nSurvey, and are now employed in its duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRUEL CARPENTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Lay, darling, thy hand on this heart of mine!\r\n   Ah! hear'st thou that knocking within the shrine?\r\n   A cruel carpenter dwells there, and he\r\n   Is busily making a coffin for me!\r\n\r\n   There's hammering and pounding by day and by night;\r\n   All sleep from my eyelids he scares in affright:\r\n   Ah, Master Carpenter, work still more fast,\r\n   That so I may slumber in peace at last!\r\n\r\n                                          --HEINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARY OF FRANCES KRASINSKA;\r\n\r\nOR, LIFE IN POLAND DURING THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nShrove Tuesday, _February 26th_.\r\n\r\nOur little Matthias says: 'One hundred horsemen despatched after _Miss\r\nBarbara_ could never reach her.' She is now her ladyship the starostine.\r\nHow can I ever describe all the entertainment and pleasure we have had\r\nduring this festival? I was as much bewildered as charmed, and must\r\nendeavor to arrange my ideas, that I may proceed in an orderly manner.\r\n\r\nEarly yesterday morning we went to the church of Lissow; the bride and\r\ngroom made their confession, and then took communion at high mass. They\r\nknelt before the high altar, and after mass, the parish priest gave them\r\nthe benediction. I was much pleased when I saw that Barbara wore the\r\npretty morning dress I had made for her: it fits her exactly. But as it\r\nwas excessively cold, she was obliged to throw over it a white satin\r\npelisse, lined with the fur of the white fox, which somewhat rumpled the\r\nmorning dress. Her head was charmingly arranged--a white blonde veil\r\nhung down to her feet.\r\n\r\nImmediately after their return to the castle they breakfasted, and the\r\nrepast was served with great magnificence.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, Barbara went up into her room, where my mother,\r\naccompanied by twelve ladies, presided at her toilette. She wore a dress\r\nof white satin with watered stripes, and trimmed with Brabant blonde,\r\nembroidered with silver. Her dress had a long train. A bunch of rosemary\r\nwas fastened at her side, and a few sprigs of the same flower were\r\nplaced in her hair, secured by a gold clasp, on which were engraved\r\nverses containing the date and day of the marriage, and various\r\nfelicitations appropriate to the occasion.\r\n\r\nBarbara looked very handsome in this attire, but my mother did not wish\r\nher to wear any jewels. She believes that wearing them at such a time is\r\na presage of misfortune, and said: 'She who wears jewels on her wedding\r\nday, will weep bitter tears all the rest of her life.' Poor Barbara\r\nneeded no more, for she had already wept so much that her eyes were all\r\nswollen. In the bouquet placed by my mother at Barbara's side were a\r\ngold ducat, coined on the day of her birth, a morsel of bread, and a\r\nlittle salt. Such is the customary usage, and it is said that a bride so\r\nprovided will never lack either of these three articles of the first\r\nnecessity. Besides these, still another symbolic precaution is taken: a\r\ntiny piece of sugar is added, to sweeten the dolors of marriage.\r\n\r\nTwelve young girls crowned with flowers, myself among them, preceded\r\nBarbara into the saloon. The eldest of our band had just finished her\r\neighteenth year.\r\n\r\nThe colonel and the Abbé Vincent awaited us near the entrance of the\r\ngreat hall; we were met by the starost with twelve gentlemen. A broad\r\nplatter, filled with flowers, was borne behind them: each bouquet was\r\ncomposed of rosemary, myrtle, and lemon and orange blossoms, tied up\r\nwith knots of white ribbon. We young ladies carried gold and silver pins\r\nto fasten them on with.\r\n\r\nMy mother and the old ladies, who presided over the ceremonies, had\r\ninstructed us in the proper method of conducting ourselves, and in all\r\nthe forms necessary to be observed, in order that no one might be\r\nwounded or offended. We understood their instructions perfectly, but by\r\nthe time we had fully entered the saloon, all was forgotten.\r\n\r\nWe began by putting on our bouquets in the most proper and solemn\r\nmanner, but were soon seized by an irresistible desire to laugh. We\r\ncommitted a thousand follies and blunders, but were readily pardoned;\r\nand I cannot say I was surprised at that, for I had already remarked\r\nthat no one bears malice toward young girls, especially when they are\r\npretty.\r\n\r\nOur gayety soon infected all the rest: married people, the old and\r\nyoung, those who had no possible claim to a bouquet, begged one of us,\r\nand we gave them with a good grace. In a few moments the whole pyramid\r\nof flowers had disappeared; the gold and silver pins were all disposed\r\nof, and we were forced to have recourse to ordinary ones; but as it was\r\nwe who gave them, they were very well received. In short, every one was\r\nenchanted, and the hall bloomed like a garden with the flowers scattered\r\naround in every direction.\r\n\r\nI suddenly perceived that our little Matthias had retired to a corner of\r\nthe hall, and was looking very sad: he had received no bouquet. As I\r\napproached him, he said to me, in a low and sentimental tone of voice:\r\n\r\n'All the young ladies have forgotten me, and I am not surprised: but\r\nyou, Frances, you, whom I have carried in my arms--you, whom I have\r\nloved since your infancy--you should not have forgotten me.... Ah! it\r\nmakes me very sad, for I foresee that even were you to marry the prince\r\nroyal, I should not be at your wedding.'\r\n\r\nI blushed to my very eyes: our poor Matthias was quite right. I ran as\r\nfast as I could to my chamber in search of a bouquet, but unfortunately\r\nthey were every one gone; my mother had distributed them all among the\r\nguests. The gardener lives at a considerable distance from the castle,\r\nand I did not know what I should do, as I was most anxious Matthias\r\nshould have his bouquet, apart from all consideration of his prophecy.\r\nSuddenly, an excellent idea occurred to me; I divided my own bouquet,\r\ntied up the half of it with a white ribbon, and fastened it to his\r\nbuttonhole by a gold pin, keeping a common one for myself. Matthias was\r\ncharmed with this proceeding, and said to me:\r\n\r\n'Frances, you are better than beautiful; you are an angel of goodness. I\r\nam sometimes a prophet: may the desires I entertain for you be all\r\nfulfilled! I will carefully preserve this bouquet until your\r\nmarriage.... What will you be, Frances, when I return it to you?'\r\n\r\nHow strange! Matthias's words occupied my mind during the whole evening.\r\nThey rang in my ears, and I could not forget them.... But what an idea!\r\nAm I a Barbara Radziwill?[B] Are we still in the times when kings make\r\nmisalliances?... What folly! I dream, when I should think only of my\r\nsister. I will return to the ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe whole company were assembled in the hall, and kept their eyes fixed\r\nupon the door. The two leaves of the folding door were thrown open, and\r\nBarbara, supported by two ladies, entered weeping. She trembled as she\r\nwalked; she seemed almost stifled by her emotion, and could scarcely\r\nrestrain her sobs. The starost regarded her tenderly, and, approaching\r\nher, took her hand to lead her to our parents. They then both knelt to\r\nreceive the paternal benediction; all present were deeply moved. After\r\nhaving received the blessing, the pair made the circuit of the room, and\r\nevery one tendered good wishes and congratulations.\r\n\r\nFinally they went into the castle chapel, where the Abbé Vincent stood\r\nbefore the altar. The minister Borch, the king's representative, and\r\nKochanowski, son of the castellan, offered their hands to Barbara, while\r\nthe starost gave his to Miss Malachowska and myself. My parents, the\r\nrest of the family, and our guests marched in, two and two. The silence\r\nwas so profound that the rustling of the silk dresses could be\r\ndistinctly heard. A great number of wax tapers were burning upon the\r\naltar, the steps were covered with a rich carpet, embroidered in gold\r\nand silver; two prie-dieus of red velvet, one embroidered with the\r\nKrasinski arms, and the other with those of the Swidzinski family, were\r\ndestined to the use of the bride and groom. All knelt; the ladies to the\r\nright and the gentlemen to the left of the altar. I held a golden dish,\r\non which were the two wedding rings. My father and mother stood behind\r\nBarbara, and the palatine behind his son.\r\n\r\nThe Veni Creator was then intoned, after which the Abbé Vincent\r\npronounced a long discourse in Latin, and finally began the marriage\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\nBarbara, in spite of her tears and sobs, said quite distinctly: 'I take\r\nthee, Michael,' etc. But the starost spoke much louder, and with much\r\nmore self-possession.\r\n\r\nAfter the rings had been exchanged, the married pair knelt at my\r\nparents' feet, and received their blessing.\r\n\r\nAt a sign from the master of ceremonies, the musicians and Italian\r\nsingers, brought expressly for the occasion, began to play and sing.\r\n\r\nWithout, our dragoons fired their muskets and all the cannon. When all\r\nwas again quiet, and it was possible to hear one's self speak, my father\r\naddressed the newly married couple in the following words:\r\n\r\n'This union, blessed by Heaven, will serve to the glory of the Eternal,\r\nwho governs the universe. May your vows, received by God, be the pledge\r\nof your happiness! You must watch over it carefully, but the husband's\r\nmission is by far the gravest; he becomes the guide and father of his\r\nwife. I place full confidence in your virtues and good qualities. As for\r\nthee, my child, it is thy duty to be ever grateful toward thy mother for\r\nthe education she has bestowed upon thee, and the care with which she\r\nwatched over thy infancy. Remain always virtuous; virtue is a treasure\r\nof happiness, the straight path, and a glory surpassing all the goods of\r\nthe earth. Be ever prudent and discreet in thy words, modest and amiable\r\nin thy actions, and never cease to render thanks to God. Love and obey\r\nthy husband as thou hast always loved and obeyed thy parents; fly all\r\nevil, be steadfast in self-government, and resigned to all the sorrows\r\nthou must meet with in this world. Take thy religion for thy constant\r\nguide, and may God bless thee, as I do at this solemn moment!'\r\n\r\nAt these last words, Barbara again began to weep; her voice was so\r\nchanged that no one could hear what she replied to my father; she fell\r\nat our parents' feet.\r\n\r\nThen came congratulations from all sides. The Abbé Vincent, after\r\nsprinkling all the spectators with holy water, presented the paten to\r\nthe wife of the king's pantler, Jordan, that she might kiss it. This was\r\na great mistake, an incomprehensible forgetfulness of the rights of\r\nprecedence: he should have offered it first to the Castellane\r\nKochanowska, mother of the prince royal's representative. My mother, who\r\nfortunately perceived the error, repaired it by begging the castellane\r\nto take precedence of the Palatiness Granowska in reconducting the\r\nstarost. Barbara walked between the king's representative and the\r\nPalatine Malachowski. In this order we reëntered the great hall, and\r\nsoon after, dinner was announced.\r\n\r\nThe table was very large, and in the form of the letter B. The service\r\nwas magnificent; in the centre stood a sugar pyramid four feet high; a\r\nFrench cook had been at work upon it for two weeks; it represented the\r\ntemple of Hymen, adorned with allegorical figures, and surmounted by the\r\nunited arms of Krasinski and Swidzinski, encircled by French\r\ninscriptions. There were, besides, quantities of other fancy articles:\r\nporcelain figures, gold and silver baskets, etc.; indeed, the table was\r\nso crowded that our dwarf Peter might have tried in vain to make his way\r\namong the various dishes and ornaments. I could not count the number of\r\ndishes, and the butler, I am sure, might try in vain to tell the number\r\nof bottles of wine which were drunk. It may perhaps give some faint idea\r\nto say that a whole tun of Hungarian wine was emptied during the repast:\r\nit was called 'Miss Barbara's wine.' My father bought it the day of\r\nBarbara's birth, that it might be drunk at her marriage, in accordance\r\nwith the old Polish custom. Each of us has her tun of wine, and our\r\nbutler tells me that when mine has remained two years longer in the\r\ncellar it will be perfect.\r\n\r\nThe toasts were innumerable; all drank to the newly married pair, to the\r\nrepublic, the king, the Duke of Courland, the prince primate, the\r\nclergy, the master and mistress of the house, and the ladies. After each\r\ntoast, the bottles were broken, the cannon fired, and the trumpets\r\nsounded.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the dessert, a perfect calm succeeded to all this noise:\r\nwe thought my father was about to give the signal for rising from the\r\ntable, but we were mistaken. He called the steward, and said a few words\r\nto him; the latter left the room, but soon returned, bringing a black\r\nmorocco case, which I had never seen before. My father opened it, and\r\ndrew forth a cup enriched with precious stones; it was in the form of a\r\nraven; he showed it to all the guests, and said it had descended to him\r\nby hereditary succession from the ancient Roman family of the Corvini,\r\nand that he had never touched it since his own wedding day. He then took\r\nfrom the butler's hand a large bottle covered with a venerable dust,\r\nbespeaking great age. He told us, not without a certain pride, that this\r\nwine was a hundred years old; he emptied all the contents into the cup,\r\nleaving not a single drop, but as the goblet was not yet full, he poured\r\nmore of the same wine into it from another bottle, and finally drank it\r\noff to the prosperity of the married pair. The toast was\r\nenthusiastically received; the music again began to play and the cannon\r\nto thunder. The cup went the rounds of the table, and its virtue was\r\nsuch, that a hundred bottles of old wine were emptied before it had made\r\nthe entire circuit. After this crowning honor, each left the table as\r\nbest he could.\r\n\r\nNight had already set in. The ladies went up into their rooms to change\r\ntheir dress, but the bride and the young ladies attending upon her\r\nremained as they were. Toward seven o'clock, when the fumes of the wine\r\nwere somewhat dissipated, all began to think of dancing, and the king's\r\nrepresentative opened the ball with Barbara. At first only Polonaises,\r\nminuets, and quadrilles were danced, but as the guests became more\r\nexcited, they ventured upon Mazurkas and Cracoviennes. Kochanowski\r\ndances the Cracovienne to perfection. According to the ancient usage,\r\nthe leader sings stanzas, which are repeated by the others. He\r\nimprovised one at the moment he began to dance with Barbara; as nearly\r\nas I can remember, it ran as follows:\r\n\r\n   'Neither king nor palatine to-day would I be,\r\n    The fortune of the starost only give to me;\r\n      For he has truly merited the fair,\r\n      The lovely lady, sweet beyond compare.'\r\n\r\nThe ball and the toasts, which had been recommenced, as if none had been\r\noffered before, were suddenly arrested, and a chair was placed in the\r\nmiddle of the hall. The bride took her seat upon it, the twelve young\r\nladies began to loosen her headdress, singing in lamentable tones:\r\n\r\n   'Ah! Barbara, farewell,\r\n    We have lost thee!'\r\n\r\nMy mother took off her garland, and Madame Malachowska placed a laced\r\ncap in its stead. I should have laughed heartily at this change, if\r\nBarbara had not been all in tears: however, the cap became her\r\nwonderfully well, and every one repeated that her husband would love her\r\ndearly, very dearly. I am sure I do not doubt it: who could help loving\r\nsuch a good, sweet young creature?\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of the cap ended, all began again to dance, and through\r\nrespect for the custom introduced by the new court, the bride danced the\r\ndrabant with the king's representative, after which the orchestra played\r\na grave Polonaise. The Palatine Swidzinski offered his hand to the\r\nbride, and she danced in turn with all the gentlemen present. As the\r\nPolonaise is rather a promenade than a dance, it suits all ages; my\r\nfather made once the tour of the hall with Barbara, and then gave her\r\nback to the starost, as was most proper. The Polonaise ended the ball,\r\nand my mother sent us all off to sleep.\r\n\r\n... I slept well, and indeed I needed rest; but I do not feel very much\r\ntired this morning. Heavens! how happy I was yesterday! I danced oftener\r\nwith the prince's representative than with any one else; he is so\r\nagreeable and converses so charmingly! That is not astonishing, for he\r\nhas been to Paris and Luneville; in fact, it is only a year since he\r\nreturned. He was then immediately attached to the person of the prince,\r\nwhom he praises highly. Indeed, if his master be more gallant than he\r\nis, he must be something really ideal.\r\n\r\nI am very glad that the festival will be continued this evening; but we\r\nmust begin to dance early, for on Shrove Tuesday we cannot dance after\r\nmidnight.\r\n\r\nI have not yet seen Barbara--I should say her ladyship the starostine,\r\nfor my parents desire we should so call her. Her absence puts me\r\ncompletely out of my reckoning, but I have fallen heir to her bed and\r\nwork table. I have finally all the honors due to the eldest. I am no\r\nlonger Frances, still less Fanny; I am the young starostine.... Indeed,\r\nI needed some consolation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWednesday, _February 27th_.\r\n\r\nTo-day is Ash Wednesday, and we must languish a whole year before\r\nanother carnival comes round.\r\n\r\nOur guests already begin to leave us. His majesty's representative\r\ndeparted yesterday, and the married pair will go day after to-morrow. We\r\nwill accompany them to Sulgostow. The starost can invite no strangers,\r\nas all amusements are forbidden during Lent; an exception has been made\r\nin favor of Kochanowski, the castellan's son. He earnestly solicited\r\nthis favor, and the starost could not refuse him, as he was his comrade\r\nat college.\r\n\r\nI am enchanted with the prospect of the little journey we are to make. I\r\nshall see my good sister's palace and domains. I cannot become\r\naccustomed to say her ladyship the starostine, when I speak of Barbara,\r\nbut I know I ought to follow the example of my parents, who call her\r\nnothing else.\r\n\r\nBarbara has become very grave since her marriage; she wears dresses with\r\nlong trains; she looks to me several years older in her grand robes, and\r\nstill seems quite sad, but that is easily understood, as she is about to\r\nquit her father's and mother's home; and then, the idea of being\r\nentirely alone with a person she scarcely knows must distress her.\r\n\r\nShe is so timid with the starost that no one would think he was her\r\nhusband; but he is not in the least timid: he calls her my wife,\r\napproaches her often, and talks much more to her than he ever did to our\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n\r\nSaturday, _March 9th_.\r\n\r\nWe returned yesterday from Sulgostow: I amused myself exceedingly while\r\nthere, but it is a real sorrow not to be able to bring her ladyship the\r\nstarostine back with us. How time flies! A week has already elapsed\r\nsince she left the castle!\r\n\r\nLast Friday, when all our guests had departed, Barbara rose early, and\r\nwent to the parish church at Lissow; she made an offering of a golden\r\nheart to the chapel which contains the image of her patron saint, and\r\nthen bade the good priest adieu. When she returned to the castle, she\r\ntook leave of all the courtiers and attendants; then went down to the\r\nfarm, and distributed all the little articles which had belonged to her\r\ndomestic establishment as a young lady. She gave away her cows, geese,\r\nand chickens to a poor peasant of Maleszow, who had just been burned out\r\nof house and home; she kept only two crested hens and her swans, which\r\nshe will take with her to Sulgostow. She gave me her birds and flowers.\r\n\r\nAfter this distribution of her little property, she expressed a desire\r\nto go once more all over the castle; she visited all the rooms on every\r\nstory, and remained long in the chapel and in our own apartment. We had\r\nscarcely finished our breakfast, when the cracking of whips was heard,\r\nand a chamberlain entered to announce that the carriages were ready. The\r\nstarost went to Barbara and told her it was time to go. Her heart\r\nswelled at these words, and tears streamed from her eyes; she threw\r\nherself at our parents' feet to thank them for all their kindness, for\r\nthe care they had bestowed upon her, and the happiness she had enjoyed\r\nduring eighteen years. She added:\r\n\r\n'All I can desire in the future, is to be as happy as I have been until\r\nthe present day.'\r\n\r\nFor the first time in my life I saw my father weep. Ah! what tender\r\nblessings our poor Barbara received!... All who were present at this\r\nscene were deeply moved.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the drawbridge, the captain of our dragoons opposed our\r\npassage, and told the starost he would not suffer him to proceed until\r\nhe had received some pledge as a promise that he would at some future\r\nday bring Barbara back to the castle. The starost gave him a beautiful\r\ndiamond ring.\r\n\r\nDuring this colloquy I had leisure to examine the starost's equipages.\r\nThey are truly magnificent: the first one had two seats, was yellow, and\r\nlined with red cloth; next came a fine landau, then a barouche, and\r\nseveral britschkas. The horses belonged to the finest breeds. To the\r\nyellow carriage, intended for the married pair, were harnessed six noble\r\nanimals, white and gray. The various members of the suite followed in\r\nthe other vehicles, and we (young ladies) brought up the rear.\r\n\r\nHer ladyship the starostine wept aloud, and we heard her sobs\r\ndistinctly; they almost broke my heart.\r\n\r\nThe courtiers, chamberlains, and even the peasants, accompanied us quite\r\na considerable distance. Barbara threw them all the money she had about\r\nher, and the starost displayed an unheard-of generosity; he gave to\r\nevery one, beginning with the steward and ending with the lowest servant\r\nin the castle.\r\n\r\nWherever we stopped to rest our horses, or to pass the night, we found\r\nthe attendance admirable. The starost gave his orders, and the tables\r\nwere covered as if by magic. The Jews, who keep most of the inns upon\r\nthe high road, turned everything out of doors, even their children and\r\ngoods, to make room for us.\r\n\r\nShortly before arriving at Sulgostow, we met the palatine and the Abbé\r\nVincent, who had preceded us in order to receive the young couple.\r\n\r\nThe peasants, led by the starost's steward, met us at the frontier of\r\nthe Sulgostow estate. The eldest member of the peasantry made a speech,\r\nat the conclusion of which all cried aloud: 'May the bride and groom\r\nlive a hundred years!'\r\n\r\nAs we entered the palace courtyard, a company of hussars discharged\r\ntheir muskets, and the captain presented arms. The palatine, with his\r\nnephew and all his court, received us at the first gate; loud\r\nacclamations arose from every quarter.\r\n\r\nThe starost presented her ladyship the starostine with an enormous bunch\r\nof keys, and the following day she assumed the reins of government. She\r\ngave her orders and directions in a manner that made it a pleasure to\r\nhear her; it is true that she had been instructed from her infancy by\r\nour mother in all the details of housekeeping.\r\n\r\nSulgostow is situated differently from our castle of Maleszow; the two\r\nmansions possess few points of resemblance. The former is a palace, and\r\nthe latter a castle.\r\n\r\nSulgostow is gay and splendid; luxury abounds on all sides, and grandeur\r\nappears in the least details. The court is numerous, and the table\r\nexcellent; but that which is of more importance is the eagerness to\r\noblige, and the attention shown by every one toward my sister. I foresee\r\nthat she will soon forget our castle.\r\n\r\nI tasted several excellent new dishes at Sulgostow, and for the first\r\ntime in my life drank coffee. My parents do not like it; they say it is\r\nunwholesome for young persons, especially for young girls, as it heats\r\nthe blood and makes the skin yellow. But I believe they will one day lay\r\naside this prejudice. It is not long since coffee was first introduced\r\ninto Poland, and people must become accustomed to it gradually. As for\r\nme, I drank plenty of it at Sulgostow; the starost is very fond of this\r\nbeverage, and obtained from my parents permission for me to drink a\r\nsmall cup every day.\r\n\r\n_Apropos_ to coffee, we all laughed heartily one day when some one\r\nrecalled the verses of the poetess Druzbacka. Speaking of a bride just\r\narrived at her husband's castle, she says: 'She could not find even\r\nthree little grains of coffee; but he gave her instead a great soup\r\nplate, filled with soup made of beer and cheese.'\r\n\r\nCertainly, the new starostine has no such complaint to make.\r\n\r\nI was very sorry to leave the starost's palace so soon. Mr. Kochanowski,\r\nthe castellan's son, is very lively, and amused us exceedingly; when we\r\ndrove out, he always rode on horse back near our carriage door.\r\n\r\nHer ladyship, the starostine, sobbed bitterly when we parted from her. I\r\ntoo felt very sad, and feel still more so now that we have returned to\r\nMaleszow; I fear this melancholy will not soon pass away.\r\n\r\n\r\nTuesday, _March 12th_.\r\n\r\nI foresaw that my sister would take all my gayety away with her. The\r\ncastle seems deserted, and all pleasure has vanished with our dear\r\nBarbara.... My parents are also very sad: Barbara, being the eldest, was\r\nmuch more with them than we were, and rendered them a thousand services.\r\nI try to fill her place, but I am very awkward in lighting my father's\r\npipe, and in choosing the silks for my mother's embroidery. With time\r\nand the help of God I hope to become more skilful, but I can never equal\r\nBarbara (I _must_ call her so for this once). I have plenty of good\r\nwill, but notwithstanding that, forget many things, while my sister\r\nnever forgot anything: the whole court speak of her in the most\r\naffectionate and exalted terms.\r\n\r\nMy parents sent a chamberlain to Sulgostow to-day, to inquire for her\r\nladyship the starostine. All the chamberlains covet the honor of bearing\r\nthe message. Michael Chronowski, who leaves to-morrow for Opole, really\r\nregrets his ancient condition.\r\n\r\nThe castle becomes daily more melancholy; the castellan's son has gone,\r\nand, during the last three days, the only visitors we have had were some\r\ntravelling friars and a gentleman of our neighborhood, who brought his\r\nyoung wife to introduce to our parents. This gentleman formerly\r\nbelonged to our court, and he seemed to me very well bred.\r\n\r\n'My heart,' said he to his wife (who had not spoken two words), 'if I am\r\na good husband and father, you must thank, first the starost, and then\r\nthe steward; the former never spared his reprimands, nor the latter his\r\nleathern strap.'\r\n\r\nI was charmed with this _naïveté_; and my father made him some very\r\nhandsome presents.\r\n\r\nSuch have been our sole visitors, and everything is sad and dull, as it\r\nalways is after so much joy and merriment. However, I should not omit\r\none occurrence which made me laugh like a crazy girl. After the wedding,\r\nmy mother distributed Barbara's wardrobe among the young ladies of the\r\nsuite and the waiting women: during our absence, each one made a dress,\r\na spencer, or a mantle for herself out of her share of the spoils, and\r\non Sunday all presented themselves tricked out in their new clothes.\r\nWhichever way we turned our eyes, we saw the fragments of Barbara's\r\nwardrobe. Our little Matthias was the first to observe it: he pretended\r\nto sigh, and when asked what troubled him, replied:\r\n\r\n'My heart aches when I behold this pillage of all that pertained to the\r\nlate Miss Barbara.'\r\n\r\nEvery one began to laugh, but Theckla and I louder than the others, and\r\nindeed so loudly, that my father reproved us by repeating the old\r\nproverb: 'At table as at church.' Our little Matthias is so droll! How\r\ncould any one help laughing?\r\n\r\n\r\nWednesday, _March 13th_.\r\n\r\nAn event took place yesterday which should certainly find a place in my\r\njournal. When, according to our custom, I went down to our parents'\r\napartments with madame and my sisters, I found Kochanowski, son of the\r\ncastellan, talking with my father in one of the window recesses; their\r\nconversation was so animated that they did not perceive our entrance. I\r\ncould not hear what they said, but the last words uttered by my father\r\ncaught my ear: 'Sir, you shall soon have my decisive answer.'\r\n\r\nHe then said something in a low tone to my mother, who sent for the\r\nsteward, and gave a whispered order; soon after, dinner was announced.\r\nMr. Kochanowski was seated opposite to me; I could not help remarking\r\nthe especial care he had bestowed upon his toilet. He wore an\r\nembroidered velvet coat, a white satin waistcoat, a frilled shirt, and\r\nlace sleeves; his hair was frizzed, curled, and pomatumed: in short,\r\neverything indicated some peculiar motive for attention to his dress.\r\nHis manners harmonized with his appearance: he spoke much, seemed\r\nexcited, was continually mingling French words in his discourse, and was\r\ntwice as witty as usual: all this became him well, and diverted me\r\nexceedingly.\r\n\r\nDinner was unusually long, and we were obliged to wait some time for the\r\nroast meat. I had abundance of leisure to observe that the castellan's\r\nson, although he talked and smiled unceasingly, was by no means at his\r\nease; he became pale and red by turns. The doors were finally opened,\r\nand the servants entered with the dishes. Kochanowski grew pale as a\r\nsheet; not knowing to what to attribute his emotion, I looked round me\r\non all sides, and my eyes fell at length upon the dishes which had just\r\nbeen brought in. I saw a goose dressed with a certain black sauce\r\n(jusznik), which among us signifies a refusal.\r\n\r\nI did not dare to raise my eyes, a thousand fancies floated through my\r\nbrain; I remembered the Cracoviennes, the Mazurkas, the minuets, in\r\nwhich Kochanowski had displayed so much grace; then his graceful\r\nappearance on horseback, the French with which he so plentifully\r\nsprinkled his conversation, and his never-failing compliments.... A\r\nfeeling of melancholy seized upon my heart, I lost courage, and could\r\nnot touch a single dish. My parents were as much affected as myself; if\r\nthe gray end had not helped to finish out the dinner, it would have been\r\nsent away untouched.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that we were ages at table; I was impatient to know the\r\nend. My father finally gave the signal, and we rose, but while we were\r\neach saying the after-dinner grace, Mr. Kochanowski slipped out at a\r\nsmall side door, and did not again make his appearance.\r\n\r\nWhen the courtiers and chamberlains had retired, my parents desired me\r\nto leave my work and come to them: my father said:\r\n\r\n'Frances, Mr. Kochanowski, son of the Castellan of Radom, has asked your\r\nhand of me. I am aware that his family is ancient and illustrious. I\r\nknow that he has a fine fortune, by no means disproportioned to your\r\nown, but this alliance does not exactly please us. In the first place,\r\nMr. Kochanowski is too young; his only distinction is derived from the\r\ntitle held by his late father; he has received no honors at court, or\r\nrather the favor shown him has conferred no very illustrious rank upon\r\nhim: finally, I think he has made rather too abrupt a declaration, and\r\nhe exacts an immediate and decisive reply. We have given him our answer,\r\nand it is in accordance with his own mode of proceeding. We are sure,\r\nFanny, that you will approve of what we have done.'\r\n\r\nHe then desired me to recommence my work, thus giving me no time to say\r\neither yes or no.\r\n\r\nI doubtless share the opinion of my parents; but as I have promised to\r\nbe entirely frank in my journal, frank without any reserve, I must\r\nconfess that neither Kochanowski's age nor the manner in which he made\r\nhis offer, appear to me sufficient objections. The true motive of the\r\nrefusal he has received is that he has no title, and, as our little\r\nMatthias says, a vice-castellan is not much: a castellan would indeed be\r\nsomething worth considering. God reads to the bottom of my soul, and I\r\nam sure I have no desire to marry; I am so well satisfied, so entirely\r\nhappy in my father's house. I was melancholy during several days after I\r\nreturned from Sulgostow, but I have now completely recovered my ancient\r\ngayety.\r\n\r\nMy position is very different from what it formerly was, and I am\r\ntreated with more respect; when there are no strangers at table, I am\r\nserved the fourth.\r\n\r\nI will accompany my parents wherever they go. I should be sorry to\r\nabandon such dear and sweet prerogatives. Besides, marriage is not so\r\nfine a thing as many deem it; a woman's career is then ended; once\r\nmarried, all is fixed and decided for life; no more changes, no more\r\ndoubts, no more hopes of something still better. One knows what one must\r\nbe, one knows what one will be until the hour of one's death, and for my\r\npart, I like to indulge in the freest range of fancy.\r\n\r\nA whole oxhide would not be large enough to contain all the dreams that\r\nfloat through my brain. When I am seated at my work, my mind is more\r\nactive than my fingers: it is so delightful to dream, to revel in a\r\nfuture of one's own creation, bright as an excitable imagination can\r\nmake it.... My mother says to me often, but I fear in vain: 'A well born\r\nand properly educated young lady should never think of her future\r\nhusband;' but, in truth, it is not of a husband that I think; it is of a\r\nthousand things, of memories, of hopes, and of descriptions, adventures,\r\netc., which I meet with in my reading, and which I involuntarily apply\r\nto myself. If my fate were to be like that of Mademoiselle Scudery's, or\r\nMadame Lafayette's, or Madame de Beaumont's heroines! I can picture all\r\nthe situations so vividly that I really believe all these adventures\r\nwill happen to me. I must confess that Barbara's marriage has much more\r\ninclined me to revery. She blamed such wanderings of the fancy, and\r\nalways hindered my reading romances; but to make up for lost time,\r\nmadame makes me read a great deal, and the more I read, the more does my\r\nimagination lose itself in vague dreams.\r\n\r\nBarbara possessed an entirely different character; she has assured me\r\nthat she never thought of her future life, or of the husband she was to\r\nhave; and if this latter idea ever crossed her mind, it was only when\r\nshe said her prayers. I must here say that, according to our mother's\r\ndesire, after we have reached our sixteenth year, we always add these\r\nwords to our prayers: 'My God, give me wisdom, good health, the love of\r\nmy neighbor, and a good husband.' This was the only moment during the\r\nday that Barbara's thoughts ever rested upon her future lord: 'And it\r\nshould be so,' she used to say; 'since one day he must replace our\r\nfather and mother, and we must love and obey him until our death.'\r\nBeyond this she felt no anxiety as to what he would be or when he would\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding her indifference, she has succeeded perfectly; her\r\nhusband is one of the most upright and excellent of men; she writes to\r\nus that after she has somewhat overcome her grief at the separation from\r\nher family, there can be no happier woman in the world than she is. One\r\nmay plainly see that she loves the starost more and more every day, and\r\nthat she is entirely satisfied with her lot. But I ... who can tell what\r\nmay be in store for me?... Indeed, my parents have done well to refuse\r\nMr. Kochanowski; I pity him, however, for the humiliation which he has\r\nreceived; but if I am to believe the prophecy of our little Matthias, he\r\nwill soon be consoled.\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday, _March 17th_.\r\n\r\nYesterday, just as we were sitting down to supper, we had a visit from\r\nmy aunt, the Princess Palatiness of Lublin, and her husband, the\r\npalatine. It was a delightful surprise: not having been able to come to\r\nmy sister's marriage, occupied as they were by their duty toward the\r\nprince royal, who was preparing to depart for his duchy of Courland,\r\nthey came to atone for their omission, and felicitate my parents on\r\ntheir daughter's marriage. The arrival of these illustrious guests has\r\nrestored life to the castle; my father cannot restrain his joy or do\r\nenough to show honor to the princess, whom he loves and respects from\r\nthe depths of his heart.\r\n\r\nFive years have elapsed since the prince and princess were last at\r\nMaleszow; I was then a child, and they find me now a young lady; their\r\ncompliments are endless. They praise my beauty, my figure, etc., until I\r\nam overwhelmed with confusion; such praises are very agreeable, but then\r\none should hear them accidentally; when they are thrown in one's face\r\nthey lose their value, they annoy and embarrass one; I am consequently\r\nbetter pleased to remember them to-day than I was to hear them\r\nyesterday. The prince palatine said very seriously, that if I were to\r\nshow myself at the court of Warsaw, the young starostine Wessel, Madame\r\nPotocka, and the princess Sapieha (the three chief court beauties) would\r\nbe eclipsed. My aunt, the princess, remarked that I still needed more\r\ngravity in my demeanor, and more dignity in my carriage.\r\n\r\nNever in my life had I heard such flattering speeches, and indeed I had\r\nno idea that I could make any pretension to so much beauty. I saw that\r\nmy father's heart was swelling with pride; but my mother, fearing lest\r\nso much flattery should render me vain, sent for me this morning, and\r\ntold me all this was nothing but a mode of speech common to courts, and\r\nthat I must not regard it as anything more important.\r\n\r\nI do not know, but it seems to me they have some designs upon me. Oh!\r\nhow I would like to know them! I did not close my eyes during the whole\r\nnight.... The prince and princess related such curious and interesting\r\nthings!\r\n\r\nMy mother desired me to retire as usual at ten o'clock, but the prince\r\npalatine begged it as a favor that I might be permitted to remain until\r\nquite late with the company.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the rejoicings upon the occasion of the prince royal's\r\ninvestiture were truly magnificent; no one can remember to have ever\r\nwitnessed so brilliant and gay a carnival. All the colleges represented\r\ntragedies and comedies, and everywhere allusions were made to the prince\r\nroyal, who seems to be adored.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday preceding Ash Wednesday (Barbara's wedding day) the\r\ncollegians, under the care of the Jesuit fathers, represented the\r\ntragedy of 'Antigone,' in which the celebrated warrior, Demetrius,\r\ndefends his father against his enemies, and restores his estates to him.\r\nAt the end of the piece the following lines were recited, and received\r\nwith the greatest applause:\r\n\r\n   'Not only 'mid the Greeks were faithful sons;\r\n    Demetrius in our own times finds his peers.\r\n    In thee, O Charles the Great, may we behold\r\n    Sublime example and heroic deeds.\r\n    For thou against injustice hast thy sire\r\n    Defended; thy dear sire, whose virtues rare\r\n    Efface the memories left by antique Greece.\r\n    Be thou the father of thy country! Reign!\r\n    Reign over us! Thy people all wilt love thee\r\n    With the love of a Demetrius.'\r\n\r\nOne may see from this that the prince royal has devoted partisans; an\r\ninterior conviction assures me that he will one day be king of Poland. I\r\nwas deeply interested in the praise which the prince palatine bestowed\r\nupon him: if I am not mistaken, the hero of my dreams will one day be a\r\ngreat man; but I may be deceived in my previsions, or they may be\r\nrendered vain by the power of intrigue.\r\n\r\nI judge of the generality by the diversity of opinion existing within\r\nour own little circle. The views of the princess palatine differ from\r\nthose of her husband. She desires to see neither the prince royal nor\r\nPoniatowski king of the republic, but carries her wishes still\r\nelsewhere.... To whose prayers will God listen?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: A beautiful Polish lady, who was secretly married to the\r\nPrince Sigismund Augustus, afterward King of Poland. When he ascended\r\nthe throne, at his father's death, he acknowledged his marriage, and\r\nBarbara reigned as queen until the year 1561, when she died, to the\r\ngreat sorrow of her husband and her people, to whom she had proved\r\nherself a real mother.--_Translator's note._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISLE OF SPRINGS.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nVOYAGE AND APPROACH.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of November, 1855, a small company of us--three gentlemen and\r\ntwo ladies--left New York harbor in the schooner Louisa Dyer, of 150\r\ntons burden, bound to the island of Jamaica. By nightfall we had lost\r\nsight of the last faint trace of New Jersey soil. New Jersey is\r\nsometimes jocularly said to be out of the Union; but on that day the two\r\nof us who were leaving our native land for the first time, entertained\r\nno doubt of its solidarity with that country of which it afforded us the\r\nlast glimpse. By morning we found our small and incommodious vessel\r\nfairly on her way through the stormy November Atlantic, toiling\r\npainfully over the broad convexity of the planet, like a plodding\r\ninsect, toward the regions of the sun. After a voyage of fifteen days,\r\nwrestling with all manner of baffling winds, and with storms attended, I\r\nsuppose, with some danger, though, from a happy incapacity of\r\napprehending peril at sea till it is over, I suffered no disquiet from\r\nthem, we came in sight of the two inlets which form the Turk's Island\r\npassage. A winter voyage, however unpleasant, has this advantage, that\r\nthen only can you be sure of meeting with such a succession of storms as\r\nshall leave settled in the memory the sullen sublimity of that\r\n'changing, restless mound' of disturbed ocean in which is embodied the\r\nmass of its gloomy might.\r\n\r\nVery pleasant was it to us, nevertheless, when the softening airs and\r\nthe steady set of the breeze showed us that we had come into the\r\nlatitude of the trade winds. The inky blackness of the sea had gradually\r\nturned into translucent and then into transparent azure, which looked as\r\nif it could be quarried out into blocks of pure blue crystal. The flying\r\nfish, glancing in quick, short flights above the sunny waters, now gave\r\nthe charm of happy, graceful life to our weary voyage out of the\r\ntempestuous north. And when at last we saw land, although it appeared\r\nonly in the shape of the two small islands mentioned above, which seem\r\nto be little more than coral reefs covered with a scanty carpet of\r\nyellowish grass, yet the few distant cocoanut trees upon them threw even\r\nover their barrenness that tropical charm which to those who first feel\r\nit seems rather to belong to another planet than to this dull one upon\r\nwhich we were born.\r\n\r\nPassing through the narrow channel between the two islands which formed\r\nthus the portal of our entrance into the Caribbean, we found ourselves\r\nfairly afloat upon the waters of that brilliant sea, which the\r\nSpaniards, three centuries and a half before, had traversed with greater\r\nastonishment, but not with more delight. Everything now conspired to\r\nraise our spirits. The soft air, reminding us by contrast of the winter\r\nwe had left behind, the deep blue sky, answered by waves of an intenser\r\nblue below, whose gentle ripples, unlike the stormy Atlantic surges\r\nwhich we had escaped, only came up to bear us kindly on, and the\r\nknowledge that we were but two days' sail from the fair island to which\r\nsome were returning, and which two of us were about to make our home for\r\nan indefinite future, all made us now a very different set from the\r\ndull, anxious, seasick group that the Atlantic had lately been boxing\r\nabout at his pleasure.\r\n\r\nBefore making Jamaica, however, we came in sight of the negro empire of\r\nHayti, and ran along for a day under its northern coast.\r\n\r\nWe saw swelling hills, covered on their tops with woods, and sloping\r\ndown to the shore, but were too far distant to distinguish very plainly\r\nany sign of human habitation. By nightfall we had sunk the land, but\r\nwere astonished in the morning to see looming through the air, at an\r\nimmense distance, a mountain, which in height seemed more like one of\r\nthe Andes than any summit that Hayti could afford. Its actual height, I\r\npresume, may not have been less than 8,000 feet, but in my memory it\r\nshows like Chimborazo.\r\n\r\nIt was now Saturday, the 8th of December. We held our way westward\r\nacross the hundred miles of sea that separate Hayti from Jamaica. All\r\neyes were now turned to discover the first glimpse of our expected\r\nisland home. At last, about the middle of the afternoon, we remarked on\r\nthe western horizon the distant blot of indigo that showed us where it\r\nlay. Another twenty-four hours would pass before we should land, but\r\nthat distant patch of mountain blue seemed to have brought us to land\r\nalready. Heavy rain clouds coming up, hid it from us again, but gave\r\nample compensation in the sunset that followed, one of the two grand\r\nsunsets of my life. The other was in Andover, Mass., which, is justly\r\ncelebrated for the beauty of its sunsets. There the banks of white\r\ncloud, lying along the west, glowed with an inner radiance, that led the\r\neye and the mind back into the very depths of heaven. Here, on the other\r\nhand, an unimaginable wealth of color was poured out on the very face of\r\nthe sky. The whole western heaven, to the zenith, was one mingled\r\nmelting mass of gorgeous dyes, rendered the more magnificent by the\r\nheavy lead-colored rain clouds which occupied all the rest of the sky.\r\n\r\nThe inward, spiritual magnificence of that northern sunset, and the\r\nunreserved splendor of this southern one, were in correspondence with\r\nthe different tone which runs throughout nature in each of the two\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nAfter sunset hues and rain cloud had both given way to the brilliant\r\nnight sky of that latitude, we seated ourselves, seven in number,\r\ncaptain and mate included, on the extensive quarter deck of not less\r\nthan seven feet from cabin house to stern bulwarks, for a final game of\r\n'Twenty Questions;' when our hitherto so amiable friend, the Caribbean,\r\nsuddenly flung a spiteful wave right over the quarter upon us, and put a\r\nvery unexpected extinguisher on our pastime. The ladies, who were\r\nreclining on the deck, came in for the chief share of the compliment,\r\nand were in some danger of an indiscriminate swash down the cabin\r\ngangway; but the mate gallantly picked up one, and her husband the\r\nother, and saved them from all mischief but the drenching. This sudden\r\ninterruption of amicable relations with the powers of the wave was\r\nfollowed up by a night of unmerciful rocking, to which, as we had now\r\ncome under the lee of the land, was added a sweltering heat. I can stand\r\nas much heat as any man, but for once I found the cabin too much of a\r\nblackhole even for me, and after tossing most of the night in alternate\r\ncorrespondence and contradiction to the pitching of the vessel, I got up\r\nand went on deck, to see if a nap were any more feasible there. I found\r\nmost of our company already recumbent in this starry bedchamber. After\r\nawhile admiring the unaccustomed brilliancy of the old familiar\r\nconstellations of our northern sky, augmented by the effulgent host\r\nwhich our approach to the equator had brought into view, among all which\r\nVenus shone like a young moon, I fell asleep also, and we slumbered in\r\nconcert, until awakened by the streaks of dawn. Soon the sun rose with a\r\nserene magnificence, well according with the day of holy rest and\r\ncheerful expectation which lay before us. The white haze upon the sky\r\nrolled away from the blue, and gathered itself into fleecy masses, which\r\nstood like pillars around the seaward horizon, brightening with a\r\ncheerful tempered light, until, as the sun grew higher, they dissolved\r\naway. Meanwhile, on the landward side of our vessel--which had rounded\r\nMorant Point in the night, and was now gliding smoothly on--lay in near\r\nview the mountains of Jamaica. Coming from the southeast quarter of the\r\nisland, we were passing under them where they are highest. They rose,\r\nseemingly almost from the water's edge, to the height of seven and eight\r\nthousand feet, their towering masses broken into gigantic wrinkles and\r\ncorrugations, whose fantastic unevenness was subdued into harmony by the\r\nsoftening veil of yellowish green darkening above, which clothed them to\r\ntheir tops. Between their base and the sea actually lies one of the most\r\nrichly cultivated districts of the island, the Plaintain Garden River\r\ndistrict. But we were too far out to distinguish much of it; and what\r\nlittle we did see is in my memory absorbed in the image of the verdant\r\ngiants which rose behind.\r\n\r\nIn the forenoon our pilot came on board, a comfortable, self-possessed\r\nblack man, who toward sunset brought us off the Palisades. This is the\r\nname of the narrow spit of land which forms the outer wall of the\r\nmagnificent harbor of Kingston. Upon it is situated the naval station of\r\nPort Royal, the principal rendezvous of the British fleet in the West\r\nIndies. Here is that exquisitely comfortable naval hospital, with its\r\nlong ranges of green jalousies, excluding the blazing light and\r\nadmitting the sea breeze, in which the officers and crew of our ship\r\nSusquehanna were cared for with such generous hospitality a few years\r\nago, when attacked by yellow fever. The heartburnings of the present may\r\nbe somewhat lessened by reflecting on some of these mutual offices of\r\nkindness in the past.\r\n\r\nAround the naval station clusters a poor village of perhaps fifteen\r\nhundred souls, the miserable remnant of the once splendid city of Port\r\nRoyal, whose sudden fate I shall relate hereafter.\r\n\r\nWe rounded the point of the Palisades--which is marked by some\r\nunfortunate cocoanut trees, which, having vainly struggled with the sea\r\nbreeze to maintain the elegant stateliness of their race, have long\r\nsince given up the contest, and resigned themselves to being stunted and\r\nbroken into the appearance of magnified splint brooms planted upside\r\ndown--and found ourselves at last in our desired haven, Kingston harbor.\r\nIt is a broad and sheltered basin, fully entitled, I understand, to the\r\nstandard encomium of a harbor of the first rank, namely, that it will\r\nfloat the united navies of the world. Due provision has been made by\r\nthree strong forts near the entrance that the navies aforesaid shall not\r\nenter until the time of such auspicious union. An intelligent\r\ncorrespondent of the _Herald_ states his opinion that no ship and no\r\nnumber of ships could force an entrance under the converging fire of the\r\nforts, which bears upon the channel at a point where the least\r\ndivergence would land a ship upon a dangerous shoal.\r\n\r\nKingston is on the inside of the harbor, six miles across from Port\r\nRoyal. The city itself lies low, but as we approached it, just as the\r\nsun had set, the mountains which rise behind it, a few miles distant, to\r\nthe height of three and five thousand feet, appeared to close around it\r\nin a sublime amphitheatre of massive verdure. High up on the side of the\r\nmountains we distinguished a white speck, which we were told was the\r\nmilitary cantonment of Newcastle, situated 4,400 feet above the sea,\r\nchosen for the English soldiers on account of its salubrity. Formerly\r\nthe annual mortality among European soldiers in the island was 130 in\r\n1,000, but since the Government has been careful to quarter them as much\r\nas possible in these elevated sites, it has diminished to 34 in 1,000.\r\n\r\nAt last our vessel came to anchor at the wharf. We took a kind leave of\r\nthe pleasant-tempered captain and crew, who had been shut up with us in\r\nthe little craft during our seventeen days' tossing, and gave a farewell\r\nof especial warmth to the fatherly mate, whose rough exterior covered\r\nthe warm heart of a seaman and the delicate feelings of a native\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nWhen we landed, the short tropical twilight was fast fading into night,\r\nbut light enough remained to show us into what a new world we had come.\r\nThe gloomy, prisonlike warehouses, the long rows of verandas before the\r\ndwellings, the dusky throngs in the streets, the unintelligible _patois_\r\nthat came to our ears on every side, occasional glimpses of strange\r\nvegetation, and, above all, the overpowering heat in December, all gave\r\nus to feel that we were at last in that tropical world, every aspect of\r\nwhich is so unlike our northern life.\r\n\r\nAfter a hospitable reception from Mr. Whitehorne, the principal of the\r\nNuco Institute, I went up to the rooms of the American Mission, and,\r\nensconcing myself behind the mosquito curtains, proceeded to make\r\ncritical observations upon the buzzings outside, to satisfy myself\r\nwhether an insular range fed up these tormentors to the formidable vigor\r\nof their continental brethren. Concluding from their timid pipings that\r\nthey were by no means an enemy so much to be dreaded--a conclusion which\r\nsubsequent experience happily confirmed--I fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nKINGSTON.\r\n\r\nHaving satisfied myself, by a sound night's rest, that the laws of my\r\nphysical constitution had undergone no essential revolution by a change\r\nto the torrid zone, I began in the morning to look curiously around to\r\nnote what the differences might be in the outer world. The quaint old\r\nlodging house itself first drew my attention, with its thick walls and\r\nheavy brick arches on the ground floor, built to guard against\r\nearthquakes, of which few years pass without several shocks, though none\r\nespecially memorable have taken place since the dreadful one of 1692.\r\nCracks in the walls here and there, however, show that it is not useless\r\nto make provision against them.\r\n\r\nWhile I was seated at a most comfortable breakfast of bread and butter\r\nand the excellent fish which abound in Kingston harbor, flanked by huge\r\noranges of enticing sweetness, a shrivelled old negro woman, who was on\r\nher knees giving the uncarpeted floor its morning application of wax,\r\nand rubbing it into a polish with a cocoanut shell, suddenly rose to her\r\nfeet and kissed her hand to me with a grace worthy of a duchess.\r\nSomewhat startled at this unexpected salutation from the fairer, or the\r\nsofter sex--I am in some doubt as to the proper adjective in this\r\ncase--I gazed rather blankly at her without replying; but she dropped on\r\nher knees again and went on with her work, satisfied doubtless that she\r\nat least knew the proprieties. It is this submissive respectfulness of\r\nthe blacks that makes it pleasant living among them, notwithstanding all\r\ntheir faults and vices. At home we are no better than our neighbors, but\r\nhere, if we only have a white complexion, we belong to the undisputed\r\naristocracy, and carry our credentials in our faces. It is that which\r\nhas bewitched so many Northern people living at the South with slavery.\r\nBut what is wanted is not a community of slaves, but only a community of\r\nblacks.\r\n\r\nAfter fortifying myself against the sweltering heat of the December\r\nmorning by copious draughts from the unglazed earthen coolers, which\r\nlook so refreshing in this climate that you often see their coarse red\r\npottery on handsomely laid tables, looking quite as well entitled to a\r\nplace as anything else, I sallied out to see what daylight would show in\r\nthe chief city of Jamaica, a city of nearly 30,000 people. I must say\r\nthat for appearance' sake the best thing for Kingston would be to have\r\nperpetual moonlight. Under the flood of silver light which the full moon\r\nhere pours down, even its forlorn shabbiness is softened into something\r\nof romantic indistinctness. But daylight is dreadfully disenchanting.\r\nThe rows of tumble-down houses, the sandy, unpaved streets--through\r\nwhich you flounder as in the deserts of Sahara, unless you choose to try\r\nsidewalks that have as many ups and downs as a range of mountains, each\r\nman building to the height that pleases himself--the large parade,\r\nwithout armament or shade, a dreary common of sand, the crowds of noisy,\r\nslouching, dirty negroes, the burnt districts, filled with the rubbish\r\nof houses and with unwholesome vegetation growing up, do not combine to\r\nform a very engaging whole. One would think it impossible to exaggerate\r\nsuch a picture of comfortless neglect. Yet bad as it is in itself, Mr.\r\nSewell has mercilessly exaggerated it. One would think from his\r\ndescription that there was not a decent house in the place, and that he\r\nhad never seen the rows of excellent dwellings on North street and East\r\nstreet. Then he speaks of the inhabitants as being, 'taken _en masse_,\r\nsteeped to the eyelids in immorality.'\r\n\r\nNow, if he meant that the great numerical majority of the inhabitants\r\nbear this character, he spoke truly, inasmuch as the great numerical\r\nmajority of the inhabitants are negroes, among the most depraved in the\r\nisland. Kingston is like the slough of Despond, a place whither all the\r\nscum and filth of the negro population in the east end of the island do\r\ncontinually run, and make it a very sink of wickedness. But are the\r\nwhite families and the large number of thoroughly respectable colored\r\nfamilies to be confounded with this mass of negro depravity, because\r\nthey are fewer in number? It is true they are fewer in number, but they\r\nare so thoroughly distinct in standing and character that Mr. Sewell is\r\njustly chargeable with cruel recklessness in confounding them together\r\nas he does. It may concern the world little to distinguish among the\r\npeople of Kingston, but it does very vitally concern the morality of\r\nauthorship, that a traveller should not, by a careless and sweeping\r\nsentence, leave a cruel sting in the minds of hundreds of refined and\r\nvirtuous women.\r\n\r\nBut I cannot vindicate Kingston society against the charge of surpassing\r\ndulness. In an insular colony, under the enervating influence of a\r\ntropical climate, the pulse of intellectual life beats very faintly, at\r\nits strongest. Still, if whatever of education and refinement there is\r\nin Kingston would cordially combine it might make a pleasant society.\r\nBut it is divided into little cliques, each mortally afraid of the rest,\r\nand producing, in their division, a paradise of tediousness.\r\n\r\nKingston, however, resembles New York in one important particular--it is\r\none of the worst-governed cities in Christendom. The Jews and the\r\nmulattoes divide municipal honors between them, and rival, not\r\nunworthily on a small scale, the united talents of Mozart and Tammany\r\nfor misgovernment and jobbery.\r\n\r\nThe stores of Kingston are well supplied with excellent English goods at\r\nreasonable prices, and are served by numbers of fresh and fine-looking\r\nBritish clerks. But of these much the greater number, I fear, fall under\r\nthe temptations of the prevailing immorality, and habits of drinking,\r\nnot to be indulged with impunity in such a climate, hurry multitudes of\r\nthem to speedy graves. What little sobriety and desire of improvement\r\nexists among the young men is chiefly confined, I am told, to the\r\nbrowns.\r\n\r\nWith the decline of exportations, the once flourishing trade of Kingston\r\nhas, of course, decreased. But it marks the eagerness of some to turn\r\neverything to the discredit of emancipation, that this decline is\r\ncommonly attributed entirely to that event, no notice being taken of the\r\nfact that Kingston was once the entrepot of a flourishing trade between\r\nEurope and the Spanish Main, which, having, in 1816, shipping to the\r\namount of 199,894 tons, and having risen in 1828 to 254,290 tons, had in\r\n1830, four years before the abolition of slavery, sunk to 130,747 tons.\r\nThe growing use of steam, making direct shipment to Europe more\r\nconvenient than transhipment, and changes in commercial relations, may\r\naccount for this falling off; but dates show that emancipation has\r\nnothing to do with it. Of course the main cause of decline in the trade\r\nof the city has been the decline in the prosperity of the island, but\r\nsuch a change in the channels of trade as is indicated above was an\r\nindependent cause.\r\n\r\nThe statistics of illegitimacy, of infant mortality, of ignorance and\r\nirreligion, and of destitution in Kingston, are shocking. Churches are\r\nnumerous, and congregations flourishing, but the vast mass of the\r\nnegroes are scarcely affected by them. This is very different from the\r\nstate of things in the country, and nothing could be more preposterous\r\nthan to judge of the rural population by Kingston. The Kingstonians\r\nthemselves are laughably ignorant of the country parts. One of them\r\nassured a clergyman of my acquaintance, with all the gravity imaginable,\r\nthat the country negroes lived principally upon fruits! No doubt he has\r\nhad the chance of telling some American touching at the port the same\r\nstory, who has been able to attest it at home on the authority of a\r\n'Jamaica gentleman of great intelligence.' The Kingston people may be\r\nintelligent, but a good many of them know little more about the interior\r\nof their own island than they do about the interior of Africa.\r\n\r\nBut ignorant and depraved as the negroes of Kingston are, besides being\r\nthree times as numerous as the trade of the place requires, I do not see\r\nthat they particularly deserve the reproach of laziness. Mr. Sewell\r\nremarks that he was puzzled to know how they had incurred it when he saw\r\nthem crowding around him, all wild for a job. The negro women certainly,\r\nwho coal the vessels, appear anything but indolent as they go to and fro\r\nerect under their heavy burdens: if the men let them do more than their\r\nshare of the heavy work, it is precisely as in Germany,[C] and for just\r\nthe same reason, namely, that the common people of neither country are\r\nsufficiently civilized to treat women as much more than a superior sort\r\nof beasts of burden. That even the Kingston populace have felt the\r\nquickening benefit of freedom, is shown by a little fact related by a\r\nshipmaster who has traded to the port for many years. He says that now\r\nhe can always get his ship loaded and unloaded in quicker time than he\r\ncould then.\r\n\r\nAs to security of life and property, there are few cities where both are\r\nsafer than in Kingston. I have gone long distances though its unlighted\r\nstreets late at night, with as little sense of danger as in a New\r\nEngland country road. There is a good police of black men, whose\r\nappearance is quite picturesque in their suits of spotless white, and a\r\nforce of black soldiers quartered in barracks in the heart of the town,\r\nbesides a part of a white regiment a few miles distant. The conduct of\r\nthe black troops, however, at an extensive fire some two years ago,\r\nwhich destroyed a large district in the business part of the town, was\r\nan illustration of what seems a curious peculiarity of the African\r\ncharacter, namely, that while docile and amenable to discipline in the\r\nhighest degree in common, the negroes are apt in critical moments to\r\nbreak out into uncontrollable license. On this occasion, the black men,\r\nsoldiers and all, instead of assisting to put out the fire, broke into\r\nthe liquor shops, and having maddened themselves by drinking, fell to\r\nindiscriminate plundering. If it had not been for the women, who, to\r\ntheir great credit, rendered energetic assistance in working the\r\nengines, the city might have been consumed.\r\n\r\nThe most curious feature in the life of a city where there are many\r\nblacks is the incessant chatter in the streets. Chaffering, quarrelling,\r\njoking, there seems to be no end to their volubility. In the country it\r\nis the same, and you will sometimes hear two shrews scolding each other\r\nfrom a couple of hilltops a quarter of a mile apart, with an energy and\r\nunction only equalled by an angry Irishwoman. Men and women fortunately\r\nquarrel so much that they fight very little. Notwithstanding the heroic\r\ndeeds of valor performed by black soldiers, I incline to think that they\r\nare, what some one describes the Arabs as being, cowardly, or at least\r\ntimid, as individuals, and brave only through discipline and number.\r\n\r\nI know of no reminiscences connected with Kingston of any essential\r\nnote, unless it be a horrible incident mentioned by Bryan Edwards, the\r\ndistinguished historian of the West Indies, as witnessed by himself in\r\n1760. This was the execution of two black men, native Africans,\r\nconvicted of the murder of their master. They were exposed in the\r\nparade, in the centre of the town, in an iron frame, and starved to\r\ndeath! Free access was allowed to the crowds who wished to talk with\r\nthem, and with whom they kept up conversation, apparently supremely\r\nindifferent to their fate. Mr. Edwards himself, after they had been\r\nexposed some days, addressed them some questions, but could not\r\nunderstand their reply. At something he said, however, they both burst\r\ninto a hearty laugh. On the morning of the ninth day one silently\r\nexpired, and the other soon followed. Punishments so barbarous strike us\r\nwith horror, but they are no gratuitous addition to slavery--they are\r\none of its necessary features. A relation founded purely on force can be\r\nmaintained only by terror. And where the proportion of whites is very\r\nsmall, as in most of the West Indies, they must compensate by the\r\natrocity of their inflictions for the weakness of their numbers. On the\r\n20th of April, 1856, there fell a rain of uncommon violence in the\r\nparish of St. Andrew, in which I was then residing. For six hours it\r\nseemed as if Niagara were rushing down upon our heads. The river\r\nWagwater, which is commonly about knee deep, ran the next morning thirty\r\nfeet high. The effect of this terrible visitation of nature was\r\nheightened by the disclosure through it of one of the monuments of\r\nancient cruelty. At Halfway Tree, a few miles from Kingston, the seat of\r\njustice for the parish of St. Andrew, and the place of sepulture for\r\nmany of the old aristocracy of the prouder days of the island, the rain\r\nwashed up an iron cage, just of size to contain a human form, and so\r\narranged with bars and spikes as to make it certain that the wretched\r\nvictim could only stand in one long agony of torture. Along with it were\r\nfound the bones of a woman, who had to appearance perished in this\r\nhideous apparatus. This dreadful revelation of the past struck horror\r\nthroughout the island. The cage, with its sad contents, is still\r\npreserved in the collection of the Society of Arts.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable religious movement of 1861, which produced fruits so\r\nexcellent in some parts of the island, in Kingston appears to have\r\ndegenerated wholly into froth and noise. But there are some agencies of\r\nspiritual and temporal good working among the lower classes with happy\r\neffect. If they do not operate appreciably in changing the general\r\ncharacter of the feculent mass, at least they rescue from it many who in\r\nthe great day of account will call their authors blessed. I may mention\r\nparticularly the charitable institutions of the excellent rector, Rev.\r\nDuncan Campbell, the reformatory for girls under the special patronage\r\nof the Rev. Mr. Watson, United Presbyterian, the vigorous efforts of\r\nRev. William Gardner and his people, and many others less familiar to\r\nme, but doubtless not less worthy of mention. But Kingston offers such\r\nattractions to the very worst of the negro population, which, at the\r\nhighest, has so much of barbarism and ignorance, that it will long\r\ncontinue a most forbidding and certainly a very unfair specimen of an\r\nemancipated race.\r\n\r\nBut, forlorn as Kingston is in itself, it is magnificently situated.\r\nBefore it stretches for six miles in breadth the noble harbor, the sight\r\nof whose brilliant blue waters, sparkling in the sun, imparts a\r\ndelicious refreshment as the eye catches a glimpse of them at the end of\r\nthe long sandy streets. Inward stretches, sloping gently up to the\r\nmountains, the beautiful plain of Liguanea, about eight miles in\r\nbreadth, scattered over with fine villas, and here and there a sugar\r\nestate. I remember with delight a view I once enjoyed just after sunset\r\nfrom St. Michael's church tower, toward the eastern end of the city.\r\nFrom that height the numerous trees planted in the yards, and which are\r\nnot conspicuous from the streets, appeared in full view, and every mean\r\nand repulsive feature being hidden, the city seemed embowered in a\r\nparadise of verdure. On the right spread out the pleasant plain of\r\nLiguanea, bounded by the massive corrugations of the dark green\r\nmountains, while on the left the lines of cocoanut trees skirted the\r\ntranquil waters of the harbor, over which the evening star was shining.\r\nI wished that those foreigners who touch at Kingston, and, disgusted\r\nwith its wretched squalor, go away and give an evil report of the goodly\r\nisland, could be permitted to see the city from no other point than St.\r\nMichael's church tower.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: See J. Ross Browne's sparkling papers in _Harper's\r\nMagazine_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAVE.\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN\r\n\r\nBY L. D.

Thus variety or plurality, which at first seemed\r\ndestructive of unity, actually rests upon it, admitting it as an\r\nelementary constituent of its very being. The _collective_ idea of the\r\nworld, _infinite variety, collection of individualities_, could not\r\nexist in us without the idea of _unity_; and closely associated with the\r\nconception of unity, is the idea of Absolute Order.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the disturbances which we witness either in physical or\r\nmoral nature, we always believe that Order will succeed the momentary\r\ninterruption of law. Even when we see earth a prey to the most dreadful\r\ncatastrophes, we always regard such a state of things as a _passing_\r\ncrisis, destined to return to the law of order. Surrounded as it is from\r\nthe cradle to the grave by an infinite variety of phenomena, the human\r\nmind for their investigation devotes itself to the search of a small\r\nnumber of laws, which will link them all, persuaded there is no\r\nphenomenon or being so rebellious to a correct classification, that its\r\nproper place or role cannot be assigned it in the great system of\r\nEternal Order. Even the savage believes in the periodic return, in the\r\nconstant and regular recurrence of natural phenomena: such convictions\r\nmust be based upon an instinctive belief in an Absolute and Universal\r\nOrder.\r\n\r\nIf we turn our gaze upon the Author of all things at the time of the\r\ncreation, we will perceive that He must have conceived the grand plan of\r\nthe universe as a single or united thought; that He has distributed\r\nbeing to all that is in different degrees; that He has subjected them\r\nall to the immutable laws of His wisdom; and that the laws under which\r\nthey are ranged to receive the Divine action are, in fact, the necessary\r\nconditions of their existence. The more distant the link in the chain of\r\nbeing is from God, the more are the laws multiplied, divided, ramified,\r\nso as to weave in their vast net that infinite variety which extends to\r\nthe utmost limits of creation; but as we approach Him in thought, these\r\ninnumerable laws form themselves into groups, these groups are again\r\nresolved into more general laws, until at last we arrive at _one_ which\r\nembraces all the others, to which they are all attached as to a common\r\ncentre, and from which they obtain force and direction.\r\n\r\nOrder is then the entire range of laws which presided at the creation,\r\nand which, linking variety to unity, change to immutability, cause the\r\ncirculation of movement, of life, through all the pores of being. Thus\r\nnature and humanity are endowed with an expansive force almost without\r\nlimits, and Absolute Order is developing in accordance with regular\r\nprogression, in the bosom of which all partial imperfections vanish, and\r\ndeath itself becomes but a momentary phase of transformation, a mystic\r\nlaboratory from which Life flows in a thousand new forms.\r\n\r\nThe True, the Beautiful, the Good, are only different faces of that\r\nUniversal Order which is their common life. Everything in creation is\r\ngifted with its own degree of life, and yet depends upon that Universal\r\nLife; is in some way attached to it, presenting a diminished image of\r\nthe Universal Order.\r\n\r\nMalebranche asks: 'Why do men love beauty? because it is a visible\r\nrepresentation of Order.' Order is at the same time an object of\r\nscience, of art, and of popular faith. It is intuitively recognized, and\r\nalthough the people may not be able to syllable its abstract formula,\r\nyet as soon as they perceive the sensible sign of it, harmony, they at\r\nonce pronounce beautiful the object which embodies it. In a last\r\nanalysis it might be asserted that the True, the Beautiful, and the\r\nGood, considered with regard to their realization in this world, are but\r\nthe representation of the pure Idea of Absolute Order. It must preside\r\nover the creation of every great work of art, whether measuring the\r\ncolumns and spanning the arches of architecture; modeling the forms of\r\nApollos; picturing the graces of virgins and cherubs; charging the air\r\nwith the electric and sublime grandeur of symphonies and requiems; or\r\ncreating Juliets, Imogens, Ophelias, and Desdemonas. Absolute Order may\r\nbe considered as the manifestation of the Divine wisdom--it must be\r\ntypified and symbolized in art.\r\n\r\nNeed we apologize for presenting to the reader, in consequence of its\r\nrelation with the subject under consideration, the following beautiful\r\nextract from the pages of Holy Writ?\r\n\r\n     'For in Wisdom is the spirit of understanding; holy, one, manifold,\r\n     subtle, eloquent, active, undefiled, sure, sweet, loving that which\r\n     is good, quick, which nothing hindereth, beneficent.\r\n\r\n     'Gentle, kind, steadfast, assured, secure, having all power,\r\n     overseeing all things and containing all Spirits, intelligible,\r\n     pure, subtle:\r\n\r\n     'For Wisdom is more active than all active things, and reacheth\r\n     everywhere by reason of her _purity_.\r\n\r\n     'For she is the breath of the power of God, a pure influence\r\n     flowing from the glory of the Almighty, therefore no defiled thing\r\n     cometh into her.\r\n\r\n     'For she is the brightness of the Eternal Light, the unspotted\r\n     mirror of God's majesty.\r\n\r\n     'And being but _One_, she can do all things; and remaining in\r\n     herself, she maketh all things new; and in all ages entering into\r\n     holy souls, she maketh them friends of God and prophets.\r\n\r\n     'For God loveth none but him who dwelleth with Wisdom.\r\n\r\n     'For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of\r\n     the stars; being compared with the light, she is found before it.\r\n\r\n     'For after this cometh the night,--but no evil can overcome\r\n     Wisdom.'\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n     'The Lord possessed me in the beginning of His ways, before He made\r\n     anything from the beginning.\r\n\r\n     'I was set up from Eternity, and of old before the earth was made.\r\n\r\n     'The depths were not as yet, and I was already conceived; neither\r\n     had the fountains of the waters as yet sprung out:\r\n\r\n     'The mountains with their huge bulk had not yet been established;\r\n     before the hills I was brought forth:\r\n\r\n     'He had not yet made the earth, nor the rivers, nor the poles of\r\n     the world.\r\n\r\n     'When He prepared the heavens I was present; when with a certain\r\n     law and compass He enclosed the depths:\r\n\r\n     'When He established the sky above, and poised the fountains of\r\n     waters:\r\n\r\n     'When He compassed the sea with its bounds, and set a law to the\r\n     waters that they should not pass their limits: when he weighed the\r\n     foundations of the earth.\r\n\r\n     'I was with Him forming all things: and was delighted every day,\r\n     playing before Him at all times;\r\n\r\n     'Playing in the world: _and my delights were to be with the\r\n     children of men_.'--PROVERBS.\r\n\r\nAs Order has been considered the symbol of Divine Wisdom, Symmetry has\r\nbeen regarded as the type of Divine Justice. In all beautiful things\r\nthere is found the opposition of one part to another, while a reciprocal\r\nbalance must be obtained or suggested. In animals the balance is\r\ngenerally between opposite sides; in the vegetable world it is less\r\ndistinct, as in the boughs on the opposite sides of trees; it often\r\namounts only to a certain tendency toward a balance, as in the opposite\r\nsides of valleys and the alternate windings of streams. In things in\r\nwhich perfect symmetry is, from their nature, impossible or improper, a\r\nbalance must be in some measure expressed before they can be\r\ncontemplated with pleasure. _Absolute equality_ is not required, still\r\nless _absolute similarity_.\r\n\r\nSymmetry must not be confounded with Proportion. Symmetry is the\r\nopposition of _equal_ quantities; proportion is the due connection of\r\n_unequal_ quantities with each other. A tree, in sending out equal\r\nboughs on opposite sides, is symmetrical; in sending out smaller boughs\r\ntoward the top, proportional. In the human face its balance of opposite\r\nsides is _symmetry_; its division upward, _proportion_.\r\n\r\nSymmetry is necessary to the _dignity_ of every form. Orderly balance\r\nand arrangement are highly essential to the more perfect operation of\r\nthe earnest and solemn qualities of the beautiful, being heavenly in\r\ntheir nature, and contrary to the violence and disorganization of sin.\r\nMinds which have been subjected to high moral influence generally\r\ndelight in symmetry: witness the harmonious lines of Milton, and the\r\nworks of the great religious painters. Where there is no symmetry, the\r\neffects of violence and passion are increased. Many works derive power\r\nfrom the want of it, but lose in proportion in the divine quality of\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nWant of moderation, extravagance, bombastic straining for effect, are\r\ndestructive of beauty, whether in color, form, motion, language, or\r\nthought;--in color, they would be called glaring; in form, inelegant; in\r\nmotion, ungraceful; in language, coarse; in thought, undisciplined; in\r\nall, unchastened: these qualities are always painful, because the signs\r\nof disobedient and irregular operation. In color, for example, it is not\r\nred, but rose color, which is the most beautiful; neither is it the\r\nbrightest green, but such gray green as we see in the distant sky, in\r\nthe clefts of the glacier, in the chrysophrase and sea foam; not but\r\nthat the expression of feeling should be deep and full, but that to\r\narrive at that _passion of the soul_ excited by the beautiful, there\r\nshould be a solemn moderation in such fulness, a reference to the high\r\nharmonies by which humanity is governed, and an obedience to which is\r\nits glory. The following short quotations serve to illustrate this\r\npoint:\r\n\r\n   'And now and then an ample tear trilled down\r\n    Her delicate cheek; it seemed she was a queen\r\n    Over her passion, which, most rebel-like,\r\n    Sought to be king o'er her.'\r\n\r\n   'I found her on the floor\r\n    In all the storm of grief, yet beautiful;\r\n    Pouring forth tears at such a lavish rate,\r\n    That were the world on fire, they might have drowned\r\n    The wrath of heaven, and quenched the mighty ruin.'\r\n\r\nCommon writers are apt to forget that exaggerated expressions chill our\r\nsympathies; that passion becomes ignoble when entertained for ignoble\r\nobjects; that when violent and unnatural, it is destructive of dignity.\r\nIn the exaggeration of its outward signs, Passion is not exalted, but\r\nits reality is evaporized.\r\n\r\n   'The fire which mounts the liquor till it runs o'er,\r\n    In _seeming_ to augment it, _wastes_ it.'\r\n\r\nThe use and value of passion is not as a subject of contemplation in\r\nitself, but as it breaks up the fountains of the great deep of the\r\nheart, or displays its might and ribbed majesty, as the stability of\r\nmountains is best seen with the restless mist quivering about them, and\r\nthe changeful clouds floating above them.\r\n\r\nWe have thus naturally arrived at the fact that Truth, another of the\r\nDivine Attributes, must make part of all art that would interest\r\nhumanity; that the soul rejects violence, or the falsehood of\r\nexaggerated description.\r\n\r\n'Sanctify your soul like a temple,' says Madame De Staël, 'and the angel\r\nof noble thoughts will not disdain to occupy it.' If the rays of\r\n'Wisdom' were reflected through the rainbow of artistic beauty by the\r\ndevout artist, he would again be, as of old, the Prophet; and the arts\r\nwould find, in typification of the Divine Attributes, ceaseless\r\nvariety, marvellous unity. Then might he stand before his Maker as the\r\nanointed high priest of nature, winning entrance into her mysteries and\r\nholy symbols, using his glorious gifts to lead his brethren back to God;\r\nand the artistic human word might become, in its appropriate sphere, the\r\nhumble and devout interpreter of the Word Eternal!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMEMBRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast night, emerging from the glaring gaslight into the starlight\r\nbeautiful and dim, there came, borne to me by the night wind, a gay\r\nyoung voice, blithely carolling the sweet strains of a well-remembered\r\nsong, familiar to me long years ago in another and distant clime. It was\r\na simple ballad, one heard most frequently in my youth, old when I was\r\nyoung; it was like a voice from the dead--a thought from the shrouded\r\npast appealing to my soul. There was something so solemn and strange, so\r\nmystically spiritual in the fact that a stranger in a strange land\r\nshould possess the power to conjure up for me a world of saddest\r\nmemories, that I half fancied at first (pardon an old man's dreaming)\r\nthat one who had lived long ago, and died before her prime, seeing now\r\nas those see where the mists of pride and passion are dispelled forever\r\nby the light of unshadowed truth, conscious now of the deep and lasting\r\nwrong she had done herself and me, that _she it was who was now singing\r\nto me through the lips of the lad_, striving to cheer the loneliness she\r\nhad caused, and comfort my desolate heart by telling me she was near me;\r\nand, obedient to the impulse given me by the wild fancy, I raised my\r\ntremulous voice, broken long ago, and quavered an accompaniment, and I\r\nand the unknown singer sang the last remaining stanza together.\r\n\r\nI can never hear that song without tears. I never hear it, even though\r\nits half-forgotten strains, dreamily warbled, are oddly mingled with a\r\nwidely different tune, in a bootless effort at remembrance; but my\r\nyouth, with its golden promise, which maturer manhood but meagrely\r\nfulfilled, turns with the shadowed years veiling its brightness, and\r\nlooks sorrowfully upon my old age in its solitude and desolation; but my\r\nlife, with its wasted energies and flagging purpose, rises up before me,\r\ndarkly and reproachfully reminding me of what I might have done, have\r\nbeen! O Heaven! what bitter years of suffering and crushing\r\ndisappointment, years on which the tracks of time have left their blight\r\nand mildew, have passed since first I listened to the bird-like warbling\r\nof its simple strains. Then was the blissful May-time of my existence,\r\nwhen I was governed by youth's generous impulses, led captive by its\r\nsweet delusions, when I fondly dreamed that my life was destined to\r\nbecome a victory and a triumph, not the failure it has proved to be! I\r\nheard it first when the love that has lived unchanged through the\r\nmournful wastes of nearly half a century, was in the gray dawn of its\r\nimmortal being. _She_ sang it to me _then_, sweet Jennie Grey, whom I\r\nwooed, but never won. Memory, faithful treasurer, points back with\r\nmystic finger, and looking through the long vista of intervening years,\r\nstanding now almost where time shall merge into eternity, that vision\r\nilluminating like a star the surrounding gloom, I can see the very\r\nnight--I can see _now_ as clearly as _then_--the round full moon\r\nlighting the dark waters with a long line of silvery brightness,\r\ncrowning the tiny ripples with light as they broke upon the shore, and\r\nflooding the well-remembered room with its mellow radiance--see her, in\r\nher fresh young beauty, seated at the old instrument, the moonlight\r\nfalling on her bright hair; the sweet eyes averted from my too admiring\r\ngaze, veiled beneath the drooping lashes, cast down with a coy pretence\r\nof studying the half-forgotten tune.\r\n\r\nI can see myself, handsome, ardent YOUNG (so widely different NOW, I can\r\nspeak of my former self without vanity), seated near, with all the love\r\nthat filled my soul for her looking from my eyes.\r\n\r\nThe bright remembrance of this is shining 'through the mists of years,'\r\nglowing and life-like as life's joyous spring time. I can see it all\r\nnow, clearly, as if it were but yesterday. Oh, radiant picture of youth\r\nand beauty! Oh, life! life! If it be a truth, and I believe it to be\r\nsuch, that in all the vast and mighty universe there is but one nature\r\nperfectly and completely assimilated unto our own; one heart in which\r\nevery pulse of feeling throbbing within our being, shall find a quick\r\nresponsive echo; a second self, the same in thought, emotion, character,\r\nor with such slight shades of difference as shall make the blending more\r\nharmonious; one, and only one, to whom God has indissolubly joined us by\r\nthe omnipotent law of a pure, immutable attraction--if this be an\r\nessential fact, then, as I sat drinking in the harmony of the song that\r\nnight, this sublime truth in all its purity was revealed to me; and with\r\nthe revelation came a purifying and exalting power, purifying my love\r\nfrom passion and every base and earthly alloy. For me, for a brief\r\ninstant, the veil had parted that divides the earthly from the\r\nspiritual, and I had caught a dim, shadowy glimpse of how it would be\r\nwith us, my idol and myself, in the great and mystic future that lay\r\nstretching far away before us; and through all my enraptured soul,\r\nfilling it with sweetest melody, a voice was murmuring: 'She is thine,\r\nthrough all the countless years of thy immortality, lift up thine eyes\r\nand look upon thine own.' Then, with a deep reverence I had never felt\r\nfor her before, with all my pure and passionate love, I raised the small\r\nhand, on which the moonlight fell white and cold, murmuring the while in\r\nsolemn triumph: 'What God has joined together, let not man put asunder.'\r\nI had received the soul's highest and clearest intuition as a direct\r\nrevelation from the Divine, and I relied upon it as such implicitly,\r\nundoubtingly. Oh, with what earnest faith, for a brief and fleeting\r\nseason, I believed that the seal of the Omnipotent had been set upon our\r\nunion, earthly as well as spiritual, and that no power on earth or in\r\nhell could prevail against its consummation! How I revelled in this\r\nsweet belief; how this blest and silent consciousness wrapped my soul in\r\nlight, and hovered ever around me like a wordless blessing! This faith\r\nwas the inspiration of my toil, the prompter to good deeds, the angel\r\nmessenger which enabled me to overcome the evil of my wayward nature.\r\n\r\nHow the sweet thought of it grew and grew until it pervaded my entire\r\nbeing, making my whole life harmonious and beautiful as the song she\r\nsang to me--a sublime and glorious dream! I did not check this pure and\r\nfervid flow of happiness with doubts and fears. I did not rouse myself\r\nto inquire whether this great truth concerning us might not, owing to\r\nsome peculiarity of my organization, be clearly and perfectly revealed\r\nto _me_, and me _alone_; so that the truth being but dimly and vaguely\r\nforeshadowed to her mind, the effect could not be as permanent and\r\nliving as in mine. I did not ruffle my soul's serenity with dark\r\nforebodings and bootless queries.\r\n\r\nSuch revelations are certainly, in consequence of their greater\r\nspirituality, more frequently made to women than to men, and I rested\r\nupon this, not thinking the reverse might be the case in the present\r\ninstance; and through the long days of that golden summer I dreamed on\r\nand on. The powerful attraction, whose nature was so plainly revealed to\r\nme that night, and faintly shadowed forth to her, now drew us together\r\nmore and more, and for a time our companionship was almost constant. We\r\nread, we walked, we talked together; we wandered through summer groves\r\nin the twilight, or, seated on the mossy root of some old tree, watched\r\nthe light dying in the west, and the stars come out one by one; or\r\nviewed the sun slowly and majestically disappearing beneath the horizon,\r\ngorgeous with clouds of purple and of gold; or marked the varied changes\r\nof the sky on the calm expanse of summer water, stretching far away\r\nbefore us. And when the light had disappeared, leaving but a dull leaden\r\nsurface, we closed our eyes and listened to the wild, mysterious murmur\r\nof the waters as they touched the sounding shore. Oh, brief and fleeting\r\ndream of earthly joy! Oh, light, warmth, and sunshine! Happiness too\r\nspiritual; companionship too blest for earth! Mortal type of the\r\nimmortal bliss that awaits me, which is drawing nearer to me day by day!\r\nI never shall believe that she did not love me _then_, unconsciously as\r\nit must have been, for it was not in a nature like hers to prove\r\nrecreant to a holy impulse. Yes, I know she then loved me! It was this\r\nbelief alone which upheld me in the chill night darkness that fell upon\r\nmy soul after shutting out the warmth and light. I'm sure she loved me\r\n_then_. I could note the silent working of the _great law_ that was\r\nunconsciously impressing her slowly, drawing her nearer to me day by\r\nday; mark the electric thrill which made the slender fingers tremulous\r\nwhen my hand lay near her own, an expressive and eloquent gesture, as\r\nif, all unconsciously, her hand was stretching forth in the sweet\r\nendeavor to clasp mine. The averted eyes, the beautiful color that\r\nflushed her cheeks, and, best and dearest sight of all, the perplexed,\r\nmystified, dimly conscious expression in the far-off distant gaze, as if\r\nthe soul was vainly struggling to grasp and clearly comprehend a great\r\ntruth but vaguely felt. I could see all this as I sat by her side,\r\npermitting the love I had not words to speak to betray me in every look,\r\ntone, and gesture. But even while I watched her thus, serenely awaiting\r\nthe time when a full consciousness should pervade her spirit as it was\r\npervading mine--now when the sun of my happiness was slowly approaching\r\nits zenith, there appeared above the horizon the little cloud doomed to\r\noverspread and darken the calm heaven of my joy. We were no longer\r\nentirely alone: a third person was added to the sweet enchanted number\r\nthat first walked the groves of Eden, and the complete spirituality of\r\nour communion was gone! Other eyes gazed on what we gazed; other eyes\r\nlooked into the blue depths of hers, and sought with mine their smiling\r\napproval, and the brightest charm of our intercourse had departed\r\nforever. The last time in which it still remained unbroken--the last\r\nsweet time that I could call her wholly mine, was on a placid autumn\r\nevening. We had strolled farther than usual, tempted by the tranquil\r\nbeauty around us, and during that walk I had been strangely, wonderfully\r\nhappy. Many times, as we walked silently side by side, a strong, an\r\nalmost irresistible impulse seemed to force me to utter those three\r\npassionate words that have caused a flutter in the heart-beat of so many\r\nthousands since the world began; and as many times the reverence I felt\r\nfor her, and the diffidence arising from it, held me back, and the words\r\nremained unspoken. Yet this contest of feeling had led me to venture\r\nmore upon outward expression: I had held her hand in mine, and twice or\r\nthrice had pressed it mutely and reverently to my lips; and she, seeing\r\nnothing of the ardor of a lover in this (the very excess of my emotion\r\nhad made me outwardly calm), had allowed me to retain it, bestowed upon\r\nme her sunniest smile, calling me the while friend and brother. It was\r\nnot the terms my heart most earnestly longed for; but I looked forward\r\nwith a lover's eye, and was content. And thus we wandered slowly back\r\nagain--back to meet one who possessed the power to change the aspect of\r\nboth our lives; the power to darken mine on earth--and who was he? A\r\nmere boy--a lover of Jennie's, who impatiently awaited our return that\r\nvery night. They had been playmates in childhood, but had not met since\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nHad I been less certain that her love would be mine in the future, I\r\nshould have trembled when I looked upon this man; for he possessed those\r\ngifts in their richness and fulness that most easily win a woman's love.\r\nThen, too, he was her mother's guest--with Jennie, morning, noon, and\r\nnight--invariably our companion in our frequent walks--always by her\r\nside, and with a mingling of tenderness and reverence proffering that\r\ndevoted and delicate homage which most readily finds its way to the\r\naffections of an artless maiden.\r\n\r\nI was too unused to the world _then_ to know it; but have deeply\r\nrealized since how irresistibly she must have charmed one so accustomed\r\nto the heartless coquetry of fashionable flirts, by the timid,\r\nwondering, child-like simplicity with which she received all this\r\nhomage.\r\n\r\nI should have known how this would end; but my faith had made me blind.\r\nIndeed, I was even then conscious how infinitely he was my superior in\r\nall that pertained to outward things: he was rich, I poor; he possessed\r\nthe varied information of the travelled man, the ease and grace of one\r\nfamiliar with the world, and I had all the awkwardness and abstracted\r\nreserve of an absorbed student. I was deeply, painfully conscious of\r\nthis. Yet, while I felt she did not return his ardent, ever-increasing\r\nlove, perhaps did not even comprehend it; while the spirituality of our\r\ncommunion still in some degree remained unbroken, I was content.\r\n\r\nI could calmly watch his ever-varying moods from gay to grave, from\r\ngrave to sad, striving by each in turn with finished art to touch the\r\nheart he felt he had not won--smiling securely, I would sometimes murmur\r\nin my happiness the while: 'Passion born of earth, not the true love\r\nthat discerneth its own, impels thee. Thy soul's betrothed is perchance\r\nof another country; turn to seek thy own; Jennie is _mine_, not\r\n_thine_!' No need to tell how, at first all unconsciously to herself, he\r\ngained the priceless treasure of her love. No need to tell how he won\r\nher heart from mine. The memory of all this is very painful even\r\nnow--enough, that after long and skilful trial he succeeded. The arrow\r\nat last struck its mark, and my boding heart then whispered how this\r\nwould end. I saw the pitying tenderness of her artless nature, shining\r\nin her soft and dreamy eye, suffusing every speaking feature, making the\r\nsweet face still more lovely, until presently compassion grew into\r\nsomething yet more tender. Then her eyes would brighten at his coming, a\r\ndeep crimson color her cheeks, a sweet and timid consciousness betray\r\nitself in every look and movement; and then, oh, anguish of spirit! _I\r\nfelt her soul gradually withdrawing itself from mine_, and my heart torn\r\nfrom the loving one on which it rested. Then followed days and nights of\r\nextreme mental anguish, a time of suffering that I cannot dwell upon\r\neven now without a shudder, when I lost faith in God and man, and cursed\r\nthe day when I beheld the light; when amid blackness, darkness, and\r\ntempest, my storm-tossed soul cried in vain for light, vainly seeking\r\nfor peace amid its wrecks and desolations. A fiery furnace, through\r\nwhich I passed that I might come out purified.\r\n\r\nThey were to be married very soon. She told me this as we sat together\r\none evening in the brief wintry twilight. The first wild transports of a\r\nnewly found bliss had subsided into a calmer feeling of happiness in her\r\nheart, as with me had passed the first 'bitter bitterness' of a\r\nlife-long grief, and I was enabled to receive her confidence with a show\r\nof brotherly regard.\r\n\r\nChristmas was the time set for the ceremony, and the first fall of snow\r\nwas even now lying on the ground.\r\n\r\nShe did not impart this information with the coy and hesitating timidity\r\nusual to her; but thoughtfully, as she sat gazing out on the dull leaden\r\nsky, watching the snowflakes falling through the dreary air. There\r\nfollowed then a long, long pause, in which I had time to recover from\r\nthe effect her words had produced, and to frame and stammer forth such\r\ncongratulations as seemed required by the occasion. These she did not\r\nanswer, or even seem to comprehend, but roused from her revery by the\r\nsound of my voice, she crossed the room and seated herself beside me,\r\nand took my hand within her own.\r\n\r\n'Brother,' she murmured, in a dreamy, half-abstracted manner, 'there has\r\nbeen something solemn and strange in our intercourse, a mysterious\r\nsomething, which my mind has vainly striven to grasp and comprehend. I\r\nhad thought the secret rested with you, and _through you_ would be\r\nrevealed to _me_; but the time for such revelation is passed; God has\r\nwilled it otherwise. Brother,' her voice sank to a solemn cadence; I\r\nhear the low tones _now_, as I heard them _then:_ 'I am the better and\r\npurer for your affection; you have led me, by what process I know not,\r\nfrom the sensuous and the earthly, to the spiritual and the holy, and\r\nthere is no epithet applied to mortals, reverently endearing enough to\r\nbe coupled with your name. I would that my words were as eloquent as my\r\nfeelings, that you might know what immeasurable gratitude I vainly\r\nstrive to compress in the brief words: I thank you.'\r\n\r\nShe wept, and I laid my hand on the bowed head in mute and speechless\r\nblessing.\r\n\r\n'O Father!' I cried, in my voiceless anguish, 'Omnipotent and good! is\r\nthere nothing that can open her eyes even now, and give me the being\r\nthine own holy laws have made my own?' No! no! The wild hope that\r\nprompted the useless prayer died within my heart as I breathed it.\r\nJealous of the brief interest that could draw his betrothed's attention\r\nfrom himself but for a moment, _he_, the boy lover, now entered, and\r\nthere were no longer gentle looks nor solemn words. He loved her best in\r\nher moods of artless gayety, and she hurriedly brushed her tears away,\r\nand hastened to be merry. Brief as had been the glimpse she had given me\r\nof her inner nature, the knowledge proved my comforter in this my time\r\nof trial, and I thanked God for it humbly and gratefully.\r\n\r\nI then had really led her from the earthly to the spiritual and holy.\r\nHer heart had unawares entertained an angel visitant; mine had\r\nunconsciously performed an angel's ministry; I, next to God and his\r\nmessengers, had power to satisfy the deepest wants of her nature. Oh,\r\nsolitary drop of consolation! The love cherished by her, and her heart's\r\nmistaken choice, was only of this _earth_; there was no element of\r\nspirituality to render it _immortal_. It was doomed to die with the\r\npassion that gave it birth, and from the grave there should be no\r\nresurrection.\r\n\r\nBlessed be God forever!... Lo! The rustic church is trimmed with\r\nevergreen, and lighted for the marriage service. Curious lookers on are\r\nthere; and with that perverse desire to test the might of their\r\nendurance, common with those who suffer, I too, am there, though I know\r\nthat her image, as she stands at the altar, where I shall see her for\r\nthe last time, through the days and nights of anguish sure to follow\r\n_this_, will be ever present with me! Yet, with my face half hidden by\r\nthe evergreens, I stand and wait her coming. They enter, bride and\r\nbridegroom; she leaning trustfully upon his arm. O Jennie! _my_ Jennie;\r\nthou who shouldst have been my bride! Great waves of tearless anguish\r\nrolled over my soul at the sight! Jennie, the priest who ministers at\r\nthe altar before which thou standest, is idly repeating words whose holy\r\nmeaning he does not comprehend: is _separating_, not _uniting_ those\r\nwhom God has joined together. O Jennie! companion of my spirit! is there\r\nno far-off, distant echo awakened in thy soul by the bitter waves of\r\nanguish surging over mine? Not now, in this thine hour of earthly love\r\nand triumph; not now. Even in spirit, 'lover and friend,' hast thou been\r\nput far from me. The low, measured tones of the minister fall on my ear;\r\nand I count the brief moments that give her to the keeping of another\r\nfor all her _mortal_ life, as the watcher counts the last moments of the\r\ndying and the loved. They kneel in prayer before the mockery of those\r\nlast words is spoken, and I kneel too, crying to the Almighty: 'Wrest\r\neven now my treasure from him, or still the anguished throbbings of my\r\nheart forever! Let me die!' O Thou tempted in all points even as we, yet\r\nwithout sin, it was meet in this my hour of extremest suffering, that\r\nThou shouldst send the promised comforter, not to bestow the earthly\r\ngood I prayed for, but to raise me above earth and all of earthly good.\r\nOpening my inner vision to behold, far as the eye of the finite may\r\nbehold, what is comprehended in the omniscient glance of the\r\nInfinite--removing the clouds brooding so darkly over my spirit, and\r\nfilling it with holy joy, by imparting radiant glimpses of the soul's\r\ncalmer and higher life in the land beyond--'the life that rights the\r\nwrongs, and reveals the mysteries of this,'--the words that were once my\r\nhope and the inspiration of my toil, came now, when that hope was dead,\r\nto soothe and comfort me--the spirit of prophecy, that cheered my spirit\r\nwith the hopeful promise of good in the time to come, and stirring my\r\nsoul to its depths, sounding through it like a song of solemn triumph.\r\n\r\nWhat though thou beholdest her the bride of another, her own heart\r\nblinded so that she cannot see aright! She is _thine_ through all the\r\ncountless years of thy immortality! His but for a brief and fleeting\r\nseason! He holds his treasure in a trembling, uncertain grasp. Change\r\nmay separate her heart from his; death may wrest it from him; the grave\r\ncover her form forever from his sight; but neither Time, nor Change, nor\r\nDeath--nothing in the present world, or in that which is to come, shall\r\nbe able to separate _thee_ from the soul _that was formed for thine_!\r\nShe is his by man's frail and perishing enactments; thine by the great\r\nlaw of attraction, by the immutable decrees of God. Seeing now, with the\r\neye of the spirit, the frail uncertain nature of the happiness which he\r\nfondly dreamed was founded on a rock, sorrow and envy left me, and I\r\ncould pity him as one deluded; and with a strange triumphant feeling, I\r\npressed forward and imprinted the first kiss on the pure brow of my\r\nheart's chosen as the bride of another. Was she dimly, vaguely conscious\r\nfor a moment of the nature of the attraction that bound our souls\r\ntogether, as she clung tearfully to _me_ for an instant, murmuring a\r\nloving farewell? It has given me comfort through all the long years that\r\nhave passed since then, to think so. She leaned from the carriage, her\r\nsweet eyes meeting mine in a sad adieu. I looked my last then on the\r\nface of the _mortal_ Jennie. But in a land of perpetual summer, lighted\r\nby the smile of God, robed in garments of everlasting light, faithful\r\nand true, there awaits me _Jennie the immortal!_ She knows it all now.\r\nThose bright seraphic eyes lighted with heaven-born love, have turned\r\nfrom celestial light to mark my gloomy wanderings. When she died, there\r\nwas added to the band of ministering spirits the one whose silent\r\ninfluence was most powerful for good, most potent to aid me in\r\novercoming evil. I have been better and purer since then. She possesses\r\nsome mystic power to make me _feel_ her presence, and to draw me toward\r\nher.\r\n\r\nSlowly, very slowly, the feeling of solitude and isolation departed from\r\nme, and I am not lonely now; bright unseen visitants soothe my solitude;\r\ntheir noiseless steps break not its solemn stillness; soft hands clasp\r\nmine; where'er I move, the spirit of loving companionship is with me.\r\nAh! to the eyes and ears of the aged, whose material perceptions are\r\nclosing forever on the sights and sounds of earth, there come, borne\r\nacross the dark-waved river on whose brink they stand, sounds from the\r\nother side; and ever and anon the mist that broods there lifts and parts\r\nitself, revealing radiant but imperfect glimpses of the promised land\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\nEre long the shadow will pass from these dimmed eyes forever, and I\r\nshall look on what she looks in heaven.\r\n\r\nI have lived the allotted time of man's probation. The days of the years\r\nof my pilgrimage are drawing to a close. It cannot be _long now_! A few\r\nmonths, it may be years, of patient endurance--\r\n\r\nAnd then--Then!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT RIOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 13th day of July, 1863, the national conscription was\r\nproceeding in two districts of New York city. By Monday night the\r\nbuildings and the blocks in which the provost marshals had their\r\nrespective offices had been burned to the ground by a furious rabble,\r\nwhose onset the police had in vain attempted to stay, and the great\r\nmetropolis of North America was at the mercy of a raging mob, which\r\nroamed through the streets, robbing, beating, burning, murdering where\r\nthey would.\r\n\r\nBy Tuesday the police had thoroughly organized, and the trial of\r\nstrength between mob-law and authority began. Night closed over a still\r\nunconquered, defiant, law-contemning insurrection.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday the public conveyances of the city were stopped, the places\r\nof business mostly closed, while the rioters alternated between hanging\r\nnegroes, burning their houses, and plundering generally, on the one\r\nhand, and fighting the military on the other. Thursday the final\r\nstruggle ensued, and when Friday dawned, though not until then, was the\r\ncity fairly delivered from the hands of the insurgents, and restored to\r\nits wonted order. Now all is tranquil, and save the occasional ruins,\r\nthe groans of the wounded in the hospitals, the agony of those who have\r\nlost friends or homes in the struggle, and the diminished number of the\r\nblacks, little remains to attest the scenes of terror through which New\r\nYork has passed.\r\n\r\nWhence came this riot? From what causes did it spring? Was it, indeed, a\r\npart of the great Southern rebellion, instigated by the emissaries of\r\nJefferson Davis? Was it instigated by the Catholic Church as a part of\r\ntheir scheme for the reconstruction of the Church in America, and for\r\nobtaining the overthrow of republican institutions as a preliminary\r\nmeans to this end? Was it the work of unprincipled politicians, who wish\r\nto put a stop to the war, in order to carry out their ambitious plans by\r\nthe aid of their Southern allies, and who thought that by stopping the\r\ndraft they could stop the war? Was it the work of plunderers and thieves\r\nwho inflamed the passions of the people, and incited them to deeds of\r\nviolence, that they might rob in security? Did it spring from the honest\r\nindignation of the poorer classes, who deemed they were wronged by the\r\n$300 exemption clause? Or, finally, was it a reaction against supposed\r\ninjustice on the part of men who believed that the forcing of\r\nindividuals to fight against their will was contrary to the very genius\r\nof our institutions and our government, which recognizes the right of\r\neach person, according to his understanding, to the pursuit of happiness\r\nabsolutely in his own way? Each one of these has been loudly urged as\r\nthe undoubted cause of the difficulty. Let us probe the matter with\r\ncare, and ascertain the source of the disturbance.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the vices of our political system, not yet remedied, that\r\nit holds out great inducements to unscrupulous and ambitious men to\r\ndeceive the ignorant and credulous masses, in order to obtain their good\r\nwill and their votes. This deception has necessarily to be practised,\r\nmoreover, concerning the individuals and the things in regard to which\r\nthe highest interests of the people demand they should not be deceived.\r\nFor the wicked and designing politician knows that good men, who really\r\nhave the interest of the people at heart, will not elect him to office.\r\nOn the contrary, they will expose his true character and unmask his\r\ndeception to the poor dupes whom he is cajoling and deluding. Hence the\r\nnecessity, on the part of such men, of putting a complete barrier\r\nbetween the really good portion of the community and the ignorant and\r\nweak, who most need their assistance. The politician of this stamp\r\nresorts, therefore, to every means in his power to destroy the\r\nconfidence of the lower classes in the higher. He succeeds in convincing\r\nthe thoughtless portion of the masses that the respectable and\r\ncomfortable citizen is his enemy and cares not for his condition, while\r\nhe himself is the poor man's friend, watchful over his interests, and\r\ncarefully guarding him from the designs of his foe. Thus the isolation\r\nof the ignorant, the wretched, and the depraved, from the benevolent,\r\nthe sympathetic, and the wise is completed, and the wily politician has\r\nhis victim and voter secure within his grasp.\r\n\r\nIn no way is the coöperation of the simple-minded and ignorant man more\r\neasily secured and his faith more firmly riveted than, by flattering his\r\nvanity and treating him as the peer of others infinitely his superiors.\r\nThe fundamental principle of our political fabric, the _political_\r\nequality of all men, has afforded ample opportunity for designing\r\npersons to mislead the uninformed among the mass, and to make them\r\nbelieve that _political_ equality means social, intellectual, and moral\r\nequality, that all are in fact equal in all respects in society, and\r\nthat their rights are infringed by their exclusion from such\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\nBut while plying the people with the most levelling dogmas of equality,\r\nit is the equality of the white race only that has been affirmed by the\r\ncrafty demagogue. The efforts for the enfranchisement of the negro have\r\nbeen eagerly seized upon to widen still further the breach between the\r\nintelligent and the ignorant. The thoughtless among the masses have been\r\npersistently taught that the emancipation of the negro would result in\r\nhis coming North, that this would bring him in as a competitor in the\r\nstruggle for life, already so arduous and harassing, and that,\r\nconsequently, the emancipation of the black was a direct blow at the\r\ninterests of the poor white laboring man. When the present national\r\nconflict began, and the politicians of the cunning, unscrupulous school\r\nthought they saw it to be their interest to gain favor with the South,\r\nthey opposed the war, and sought to league the populace on their side by\r\nraising the cry that the contest was for emancipation, not for saving\r\nthe Union. And now, when all other efforts to end the struggle in favor\r\nof the South are unavailing, they have fastened on the prevention of the\r\ndraft as the 'last ditch' in which to make a final stand and risk a last\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nThey have summoned all their forces to the field in this contest. They\r\nurge the poor man to resist the conscription, because it infringes the\r\nequality of the citizen and makes an invidious distinction between the\r\nrich and the poor. They teach him that he is being forced from fireside\r\nand friends, while others no better than himself are left at home; that\r\nhis family are left destitute by his absence, while others remain to\r\nprotect and support their dependants; that he is forced to do this in a\r\nwar which has for its principal object the liberation of a people whom\r\nhe believes he has every cause to hate, and who will become, on their\r\nliberation, his rivals in the race where suffering and perhaps\r\nstarvation await the loser. Is it any wonder that they broke the wheel,\r\nscattered the names, and burnt the enrolling offices--that they\r\nplundered and murdered the negroes?\r\n\r\nThe New York riot had its active origin, nucleus, and strength in a\r\nfeeling of bitter injustice, entertained by ignorant, simple-minded,\r\ncrude men, the lowest class of our population, who had been deliberately\r\ndeceived in relation to facts, by unscrupulous politicians, for\r\nambitious purposes. They had been inflamed with wrath by supposed wrong;\r\ntheir worst passions were aroused, they had lost their self-control, and\r\nbecame reckless. It matters little whether the actual hostilities began\r\nby a spontaneous outburst of anger, when the passions had simmered a\r\nlong time; or whether the emissaries of the politicians actually incited\r\nto the specific act at a preconcerted period. The responsibility of the\r\nlatter is noways diminished if no such intervention occurred; the\r\nessential nature of the outbreak is the same if it did. Had there not\r\nbeen this deep-seated feeling of wrong on the part of a portion of the\r\npeople, the instigations of the emissaries would have met no response.\r\nThe sinew of the insurrection was this honest resentment of fancied\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nEverything goes to prove that, in the outset, so far as the _original\r\nactive rioters_ were concerned, the draft was the immediate cause of the\r\ndisturbance. They first burnt one provost marshal's office, and then\r\nproceeded a mile or more to burn another. Then they burnt the colored\r\nasylum. This was the first day's work mainly. There is no adequate\r\nexplanation of the hatred exhibited to the negro throughout this riot,\r\nother than the supposition that the mob, or rather that portion of it\r\nwho were abusing the blacks, believed that they were being forced from\r\ntheir homes in the service of a war, the object and purpose of which was\r\nthe liberation of the negroes, and that, therefore, in a certain sense,\r\nthe colored people were the cause of their being drafted. The peculiar\r\nfeature of this mob, as contrasted with ordinary ones, was this\r\nbitterness against the negro.\r\n\r\nOn the succeeding days, however, the elements of the mob changed. The\r\nsame nucleus remained, but other constituents were added to it. Thieves\r\nand plunderers joined it, for the sole purpose doubtless of robbing in\r\nsafety; probably the first peacebreakers themselves, not ordinarily\r\npilferers, carried off the articles of value, which were scattered among\r\nthe ruins their rage had created. Scheming politicians fanned the flame\r\nwhich their teachings had already lit; the journals which are almost\r\nundisguisedly in favor of a dishonorable peace, and of a return of the\r\nSouthern States with slavery untouched, skilfully incited, while seeming\r\nto discourage, the now rum-maddened and blood-drunken fiends; the idle,\r\nthe vicious, the curious joined the throng, and the motives of the mob\r\nbecame as varied and diverse as its elements. Some hoped to stop the\r\ndraft and remain unmolested at home. Others hoped to stop the draft, in\r\norder to stop the war, and enable them to say to the South, We have\r\nprevented your subjugation: give us our political reward. Some hoped to\r\noverthrow all law and order, that they might revel in the wealth they\r\ncould then sequester. The great mass probably neither knew nor cared to\r\nwhat end they tended--their worst passions were aroused and controlled\r\nthem; they luxuriated in violence and bloodshed, and their brutal\r\ninstincts were satisfied.\r\n\r\nThat the riot had any significant religious characteristics is not\r\nprobable. Catholics were in it and of it, and so were Protestants. The\r\nmob was composed principally of those who scout all pretence of religion\r\nof any kind, and who are as little influenced by the priest as the\r\nnegligent Protestant is by the preacher. Had it been otherwise, the\r\npriest who endeavored to get the body of Colonel O'Brien would have\r\neasily prevailed; for no church-going Catholics would refuse, in their\r\nwildest frenzy, the request of a priest for the possession of a dying\r\nman. That there are honest bigots in the Catholic Church who believe\r\nthat within her pale only is safety for the human race, who believe,\r\nfurthermore, that republican institutions are incompatible with her full\r\nsupremacy, and rejoice, therefore, with holy zeal, at anything which\r\nseems to indicate their instability, is doubtless true. Some such\r\nindividuals may have been among the rioters, urging them on in their\r\nfrenzied work. But the manly, sincere, and indignant castigation given\r\nby the Catholic priesthood to the wretched miscreants on the Sunday\r\nfollowing the disturbances, precludes any possibility of suspicion that\r\nthe Church was either aware of the intended uprising, or that it\r\napproved the purposes or actions of the mob.\r\n\r\nIn deciding, then, as to the real character and purpose of the rioters,\r\ntwo distinct classes of persons must be taken into account: those\r\nactively engaged in insurgent proceedings, and those who, not appearing\r\non the scene of action, incited and sustained the former in their\r\ndemonstrations.\r\n\r\nThat the motives and purposes of the one class were different from those\r\nof the other, has been already indicated. The main object of the parties\r\nin the background, who had constantly been fomenting discord, was\r\nundoubtedly to aid the cause of the Southern rebellion, with whom they\r\nsympathize, not perhaps because they care for the South, but because\r\nthey think their own interests demand its coöperation. The chief design\r\nof the first peacebreakers was to stop the draft, that they might not be\r\nforced away from home to fight, against their wishes. That they knew the\r\nreal designs of their instigators, or that they had any prompters to the\r\nspecific acts which inaugurated the riot, is not probable; that, after\r\nthe commencement of the sedition, they were joined by such, and urged to\r\nfurther violence, cannot be doubted.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection had not, therefore, in its largest proportions, one\r\nsingle distinctive purpose, and was not the work of one set of men. It\r\nwas a rising against the draft, but not wholly so. It was a blow in aid\r\nof the South, though not this only. It was a thieves' tumult, but that\r\nwas not all. It was all of these, with some other ingredients,\r\npreviously mentioned, the whole clustering and crystallizing around a\r\nnucleus of crude, ignorant, hard-working, passionate, rough, turbulent\r\nmen, deceived by the adroit misrepresentations of interested persons,\r\nuntil, driven to madness by a sense of supposed injustice, they believed\r\nthemselves justified in securing redress by the only means they knew.\r\n\r\nShall we stop here in our analysis of the nature and constituents of the\r\nNew York mob? Have we yet discovered the fundamental causes which\r\nproduced the riot, so that we shall be able to prevent such recurrences\r\nin the future? Or have we in reality only penetrated the crust of the\r\nquestion, and ascertained the immediate and superficial causes, not the\r\nradical and basic ones? The latter is the case. We have thus far seen\r\nthe apparent and proximate causes merely--which brought to the surface,\r\nat the present time, a riotous disposition, always existent in the\r\ncommunity, a volcano slumbering and smouldering, ever ready to burst\r\nforth and deluge society with its withering and destroying lava,\r\nwhenever the flame is fitly fanned. Until we know the source of this\r\nriotous tendency in a portion of our population, the deeper cause of\r\nthis recent outbreak, as of all our outbreaks, we are yet ignorant of\r\nthe true sources of the frightful disturbance which our social order has\r\nsustained, in any such sense as makes a knowledge of causes practically\r\navailable for remedy and cure.\r\n\r\nWhether the preceding analysis of the mob be a true one or not,\r\ntherefore; whether it were a part of the great Southern rebellion,\r\nbrought about by rebel agents from abroad or living in our midst; or an\r\noutbreak of indignation against a law supposed to be unjust; or a riot\r\nof thieves, whose main purpose was plunder; or a politicians' bubble\r\nmerely;--whether it were any or all of these, or something different\r\nfrom these or more than these; in any of these cases, we are yet at the\r\nthreshold of our inquiry concerning it. We must go back over some ground\r\nwhich we have cursorily traversed, and look closer at the elements of\r\nsociety, to find a fitting solution to the spirit and conduct of the\r\nmob. Men are not given to acts of atrocious brutality, to frightful\r\nrage, or to wanton rapine, without the existence of some cause for their\r\nproceedings. However depraved a few individuals may be, the love of\r\ndoing outrageous things for the mere sake of doing them is not natural\r\nto the human race. If there had not existed some deep feeling of\r\nsupposed injustice on the part of the masses engaged in the sedition,\r\ncoupled with the habitual misery of their lives, the wild frenzy of July\r\nwould have been impossible. If the multitude had been rightly informed\r\nand judiciously cared for, neither the politicians nor the rebel\r\nemissaries could have stirred them to insurrection, nor thieves have\r\ngained their assistance and support.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the turbulent spirit exhibited in a large class of our\r\npopulation is, principally, the sense of pecuniary insecurity in which\r\nthey live; the fear lest by an overabundance in the supply of labor, or\r\nby the disability of the laborer, they should be unable to get the means\r\nof living for themselves and their families. The writer of this article\r\nwas impelled, by the duties of his profession, to spend his entire time,\r\nsave the hours of sleep, during the days of the riot and the two weeks\r\nsubsequent, among the active insurgents, in the neighborhood of the\r\nconflicts, and in other situations, which gave him peculiar advantages\r\nfor knowing the nature of the mob and the causes of its actions. The\r\nprevailing complaint among the first active insurgents, and their\r\nsympathizers among the poor, was that they were about to be forced away\r\nfrom home to fight for the freedom of the blacks, who when free would\r\nbecome their competitors for the little they now earn. In listening to\r\nthe knots gathered at the corners, to the conversation among the\r\ninhabitants of the most violently riotous districts, the words which\r\nfell oftenest upon the ear were those of bitter, burning, blasting\r\ndenunciation against the apathy of the rich, who, while enjoying the\r\ncomforts of a competency, are forgetful of the continuous, persistent,\r\nhopeless, never-to-be-relieved, and crushing poverty of the poor, with\r\nits inevitable accompaniments. The writer does not hesitate to affirm,\r\nthat but for this sense of the insecurity of their means of living, and\r\nthe mistaken notions which had been instilled into them in regard to the\r\nnegroes and the object of this war, as increasing still further this\r\ninsecurity--a deception to which their ignorance, the necessary result\r\nof their present pecuniary conditions, even were there no other causes\r\nfor it, renders them at all times liable--they could not have been\r\nincited to the recent sedition.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy for men who do not feel the daily and hourly pressure of\r\npoverty, to comprehend the constant solicitude which weighs upon the\r\nindigent. It is still less easy for them to understand the intensely\r\npractical point of view from which the poor must regard every question\r\nsubmitted to them, and the equally practical and speedy solution which\r\nthey must find to problems of social interest presented for their\r\nconsideration. The citizen who is comfortably situated in relation to\r\nmoney matters, can afford to look at the result which any social,\r\neconomical, or mechanical change will introduce in his affairs with\r\nreference to a period of time more or less extended into the future. The\r\nman who has no capital, who literally earns his _daily_ bread, and whose\r\nability to gain a livelihood for himself and his family depends upon his\r\nconstant, unintermitted labor, is in no condition to look at any aspect\r\nof any question but in the one, vital, all-important view of his\r\npersonal necessities. Anything which stops his work, for a week even, is\r\ndestructive to him, no matter how beneficial its after results may\r\npromise to be. The binding force of dire necessity coerces him into this\r\nposition; and even were he intelligent enough to see that all progress,\r\nno matter how destructive to particular departments of industry at\r\nfirst, eventually benefits _all_ classes and _all_ individuals, he\r\ncannot afford to consider the question from this stand-point, if it\r\naffects his immediate occupation. The benefits of progress must be of\r\nsecondary importance to an individual, when the present issue which the\r\ncase presents to him is starvation or work. If the proposed improvement\r\nis liable to throw him out of employment for even a brief period, he\r\nmust look upon it as a hostile invader and resist its introduction. It\r\nis this insecurity of social condition, therefore, which has always\r\narrayed a portion of the masses against the introduction of new\r\ninventions, improvements in machinery, and labor-saving appliances of\r\nall descriptions, and which has caused the riots and violent\r\ndemonstrations which, at times, have accompanied the first use of new\r\nmechanical contrivances. One of the _first_ results of the introduction\r\nof labor-saving machinery is to throw a large number of people\r\ntemporarily out of employment. This is forcibly felt by the ignorant\r\nmasses. They are not educated enough to see that this first result is\r\nmore than counterbalanced by subsequent benefits;--indeed, it is still a\r\ndebated question with many people of ordinary intelligence whether, on\r\naccount of the large number of people primarily deprived of occupation,\r\nlabor-saving machinery be a benefit to society;--and if they were so\r\neducated, their immediate necessities cannot be satisfied with this\r\nsolution. The same is true in regard to the abolition of slavery. One of\r\nthe first fruits of this measure will be, as they believe, to cause a\r\nlarge number of negroes to emigrate North. This is the practical point\r\nof the question which the poor and ignorant see. The results of this\r\nimmigration have been magnified to them; a statement of the\r\ncounteracting tendencies has been withheld by those interested in\r\nfomenting discord, or if not withheld, they do not see these as\r\noperating immediately on their condition, and hence regard them as\r\npractically not existing.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, the wretched material condition of the poorer masses\r\nand the ignorance, stupidity, brutality, and degradation accompanying\r\nthese, together with the apathy of the rich and intelligent classes to\r\ntheir situation, which are the latent causes of our social broils, the\r\nrecent riot included. In speaking of the pecuniary conditions and the\r\nsufferings of the lowest masses, let it be understood that no reference\r\nis intended to the present economical relations of labor and price, as\r\ncompared with those of other times. I refer to the _status_ of the\r\npoorest classes in society; to the miserable method of their lives,\r\nalways wretched, ever burdensome, with but one source of temporary\r\nrelief within their means, the grogshop, which deepens their misery; to\r\ntheir hopeless degradation and perpetual ignorance, under present social\r\narrangements, whether labor be a little higher for a time or not. On the\r\nother hand, in referring to the apathy of the rich and intelligent\r\nclasses, I do not charge them with a want of large benevolence on the\r\nordinary charitable plane, but to something far different, as will\r\nappear in the sequel.\r\n\r\nIt is time, then, that the intelligent and opulent classes began to\r\nreflect upon the nature of the community in which they live, and upon\r\nthe conditions of their neighbors; not, as heretofore, in a casual way,\r\nand without any intention of thoroughly considering the question, or\r\ndoing anything to remedy radically the defects which they may discover,\r\nbut in the spirit of desire and determination to relieve the masses\r\npermanently of burdens which press heavily upon them, to rescue them\r\nfrom the persistent deception of the intriguing demagogues whose snares\r\nare winding closer and closer around them, and to unite in bonds of\r\nrespect and mutual assistance the physical substratum of society with\r\nthe moral, intellectual, and substantial. The scenes of the New York\r\nriot are a solemn warning that the time has come when society must begin\r\nin earnest the work of lifting the masses out of their degradation,\r\ntheir squalor, their ignorance, and their poverty, or the lowest\r\nclasses, driven to desperation, will make the attempt, at least, to drag\r\nsociety down to their level. The doctrine of equality has been pushed to\r\nits utmost in the hands of political cajolers, until the practical logic\r\nof the crude multitude, spurred to its intellectual conclusions by\r\nphysical necessity, asks, What sort of equality is that which keeps the\r\nlargest portion of the people in want, while the smaller rolls in\r\nplenty? So long as the estrangement of the lower classes from their\r\nnatural directors and advisers continues, so long will these dangerous\r\ndistortions of truth be powerful weapons in the hands of unfeeling men,\r\nwhose interests and purposes are subserved by deception. And this\r\nestrangement will never cease until the intelligence and wealth of the\r\ncommunity withdraw the allegiance of the masses from tricksters and\r\nschemers, and transfer it to themselves by the inauguration of such\r\nmethods of social amelioration as shall convince the multitude of the\r\nfalsity of the demagogue's teaching, and satisfy them of the fact that\r\nthe higher classes have really their welfare at heart, and are anxious\r\nfor their comfort and happiness. When this is done, the ignorant\r\npopulation will no longer be leagued on the side of falsehood, no longer\r\nstand the steady opponents of that progress which is so beneficial to\r\nthemselves. The argument of practical help will have convinced them who\r\ntheir true friends are, and neither the rebel emissary, the dishonest\r\npolitician, nor the thief will be able to stir them to insurrection, nor\r\ncontrol them to the opposition of salutary and judicious laws.\r\n\r\nThe kind of relationship which must exist between the rich and\r\nbenevolent classes and the ignorant poor, must be a closer one in the\r\nfuture than has ever been in the past, and of a different character. In\r\nearlier times the isolation and separation which are common between the\r\nvarious orders of society in America, were unknown. There are many\r\ncountries in which the powerful and opulent feel an obligation resting\r\nupon them to be the guardians and social providence of the weak and the\r\nhumble. Hence the two classes are united to each other by ties of\r\nrespect and order on the part of the indigent, and of care and\r\nprotection on the part of the wealthy. The sense of pecuniary insecurity\r\nis there little felt, and the ignorant poor are not left to the\r\nmachinations of any trickster whose interest it may be to deceive them.\r\nIt is for this reason that even in societies where the oppression of the\r\npoor and weak is, in other ways, infinitely greater than in this\r\ncountry, riots and seditions are difficult to create. It is because of\r\nthe social providence which, theoretically, and, in an appreciable\r\ndegree, practically, the Southern master extends over his slaves, that\r\nit is so difficult to arouse them to insurrection. True, in the case of\r\nthe slave and the landed peasant, the security from physical want is\r\npurchased by the sacrifice of other and higher advantages, but to a\r\nlarge proportion of the ignorant and the weak the means of life are more\r\nimportant than any other blessings.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the spirit of our institutions, we enter as equals\r\ninto the competitive struggle of life, where all cannot be gainers, and\r\nwhere it is inevitable that the strong and the intelligent should\r\nsucceed, while the feeble and the ignorant must fail. But as both\r\nclasses have been admitted freely into the race, there is no feeling on\r\nthe part of the winners of duty or obligation toward the losers. If one\r\nchooses to be charitable, he may; if not, society has no claim upon him,\r\nno right to _expect_ that he will make the care of others a part of his\r\nduty or his business. Thus the community is arrayed in two great\r\nclasses: the intelligent, the strong in mind, and those of larger\r\ncapacities, who, as a class, are rich, on the one side; and the\r\nignorant, the weak-minded, the crude, who, as a body, are poor, on the\r\nother. A great gulf separates these two classes, who have nothing in\r\ncommon, and society rests on a social basis composed of forlorn,\r\ndissatisfied, ignorant people, developing day by day still more the\r\naccompaniments of ignorance and poverty--brutality, viciousness,\r\ndrunkenness, and ferocity. This separation has too long continued, has\r\ntoo long left the country a prey to political demagogues, who have\r\nplunged it into repeated turmoils, and finally into civil war, by being\r\nable to operate upon the fears and feelings of the ignorant, deprived of\r\nall natural and proper guidance. It is a question, not only of duty, but\r\nof safety, for the rich and intelligent, whether they will suffer the\r\nlower orders to remain in their wretchedness and sullen dissatisfaction,\r\nsinking daily into still deeper degradation, and engendering still more\r\nbitter hatred; or whether they will accept their proper position as the\r\norganized guides and permanent social providence of the weak, and\r\nfaithfully perform its functions.\r\n\r\nIn pressing upon the higher classes the obligation which they owe to the\r\nlower orders of society, and in urging them to assume the guardianship\r\nof the latter, the writer is not referring to vague and diffuse measures\r\nof ordinary philanthropy, but to definite and practical ones, of vast\r\nimportance to the welfare of the wealthiest as well as to that of the\r\npoorest member of society. The individuals who have been most actively\r\nengaged in the stirring scenes of commercial life, are little aware, for\r\nthe most part, of the rapid advances made in social science during the\r\nlast twenty years, and especially within the last ten of these.\r\nExtensive as the new principles evolved in the department of mechanical\r\ndiscovery, during this period, have been, those in that of commercial\r\nand social activity have fully equalled them. The true method of\r\norganizing the workshop, the farm, and the manufactory, the right\r\nadjustment of capital and labor so as to secure larger advantages than\r\nheretofore to both capitalist and laborer, the just adaptation of supply\r\nand demand in community, the mutually beneficial coöperation of employer\r\nand employé, these and other questions of deep significance to the whole\r\ncommunity have reached a theoretical, and, to a limited extent, a\r\npractical solution, which the students of social science patiently wait\r\nto communicate to the active workers in commercial or industrial\r\naffairs. For the want of this knowledge, now ready at their call, the\r\ncapitalists and the employers are suffering, no less than the laborers\r\nand the employed. There is not a single department of human labor in\r\nwhich principles are not now known to the industrial scientist, which\r\nwould enhance many fold the value of the means employed in such\r\nbusiness, to the equal advantage of the owner of the capital and his\r\nassistants. The merchants, the bankers, the manufacturers, and the\r\nmaster mechanics are making a wasteful and inferior use of their\r\nmaterial, while at the same time they are inadvertently keeping the\r\nlower classes in poverty by the want of a knowledge of these modern\r\ndiscoveries. It is from this lack of information only that the poor of\r\nNew York, who to-day are steeped in their filth, their squalor, and\r\ntheir penury, are not each and all of them enjoying the comforts of a\r\nmoderate competence and a decent home, the securing of which for them\r\nwould have, at the same time, enhanced the wealth of the employers. The\r\nway to gain the allegiance, devotion, and fidelity of the poorer orders,\r\nis easy and simple. The problem of the harmonization of the interests of\r\nclasses in community with mutual benefit to all, is scientifically\r\nsolved. It only remains for the intelligent and benevolent to give due\r\nattention to the teachings of science in order to secure the most\r\nbeneficial results.\r\n\r\nAlready these modern industrial principles are being adopted in some\r\nconsiderable degree into active practice by eminent citizens. In New\r\nYork city the methods of recent discoveries are being introduced into\r\nlarge manufactories with the most satisfactory and beneficial results to\r\nall concerned. But these attempts, as yet, have been undertaken without\r\nany thorough examination of the whole scope of principles relating to\r\nthe operations in hand, and hence without the largest achievable\r\nresults. These will come when the intelligent and moneyed classes awake\r\nto the importance of the subject; to the understanding that the\r\nknowledge of methods for securing immense social improvements is in\r\nexistence; and to a determination to possess that knowledge and to apply\r\nit to its legitimate ends--the organization of a social providence for\r\nthe ignorant and weak, and the binding of all classes of society into\r\nrelations of mutual sympathy and assistance.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, looks to a period of time, more or less, though it is\r\nto be hoped not far, distant. In the meantime, while society remains\r\nwith its present constitution, riots are liable, and a practical\r\nquestion still remains, of the method which should be pursued in dealing\r\nwith them. There is a time for all things, said a man of reputed wisdom.\r\nAnd the time for considering the sufferings of a people or for being in\r\nanywise tender hearted, is not when a madman or a cohort of madmen are\r\nhowling about your houses or your city, with knives and torches, blood\r\nin their eyes, fiery rum in their veins, demoniac rage in their hearts,\r\nand the instincts of hell in their natures. A mob has no mind, only\r\npassions. It were as idle to attempt to make it listen to reason, as to\r\nargue with a lunatic in the height of his frenzy. A mob is not only a\r\ncreature of passions, but of the worst passions. Every man has in him\r\nmore or less of the demoniac element, which, commonly, he is constrained\r\nby the requirements of the society in which he lives to keep within\r\ndecent limits. A mob can never have an existence until the parties which\r\ncompose its nucleus, at least, have toppled from their customary\r\nself-control, and passion has assumed the guidance. Then the devil, long\r\nrestrained and compressed, takes a holiday. As a high-mettled steed,\r\nafter being kept a long time within the narrow limits of his stable, and\r\nbeing obliged to conduct himself in a staid manner, on being released,\r\nruns, whisks his tail, kicks up his heels, lays back his ears, opens his\r\nmouth, and rushes with mock vicious-looking eyes at whomsoever he meets,\r\nand all this from mere wantonness, to enjoy his freedom; so the devil in\r\nthe man, not perchance the theological one, but still the devil no less\r\nactually, as seen every day in the activity of the baser passions, on\r\nbeing released, by the abdication of reason and the substitution of\r\nfeeling, begins to exercise his ingenuity in the play of his faculties,\r\ncompensating himself for his long confinement. From hour to hour, and\r\nfrom day to day, this devil gets fuller possession of the individual,\r\nwho becomes more and more an unreasoning creature, until a blind,\r\nfurious, brutal, bloodthirsty demon is all that remains of what might\r\nhave once been merely a not well balanced human being.\r\n\r\nIt is notorious that a mob will commit atrocities which a single\r\nindividual could scarcely be tempted to perpetrate. The reason is\r\npartially evident from the statement just made. A more philosophical\r\nexplanation may be given. It is a law of social intercourse that there\r\nis always among companies of individuals a more or less effective\r\ncontagion of whatever sentiment is most powerful among them. Still\r\nfurther, this contagion or magnetic battery of sympathy, while pervading\r\nthe whole assembly, likewise increases the individual potency of the\r\nsentiment in the mind of each person. It is for this reason, that an\r\norator thrills more deeply each hearer in a vast sympathetic assembly,\r\nthan he would the same individual in a less crowded company; that music\r\nis more inspiring in a great crowd of people than elsewhere, etc. In an\r\nassemblage where the finer sentiments are predominant, this contagion is\r\nof the finer sort, and serves to elevate the whole company: in a\r\ngathering where the lower passions preponderate, the contagion is of the\r\ndebasing kind, and serves to excite still further the worst elements of\r\nbrutality, and to sink the individuals which compose the company still\r\nlower in the scale of humanity. To the educators of the young and to the\r\ngovernors of the people, this law is of immense importance.\r\n\r\nA mob is, therefore, not only under the influence of its worst passions,\r\nbut every hour of its existence these are growing more potent, in the\r\nmob as an entity, and in the persons which compose it. The only true\r\nmercy which can be shown to such an assembly, aside from any question of\r\nthe safety of community, is to suppress it; to suppress it at once; and\r\nto use every means necessary to that end. Relentless rigor is the only\r\nmeasure adequate to the occasion. It is the weakness of civilization\r\nthat it hesitates to be cruelly kind. The mistake of the military\r\nauthorities in regard to the New York riot, was lenity. The prompt and\r\nvigorous bombardment, in the beginning of the rising, of a block of the\r\nhouses in which the rioters were safely ensconced, while covertly firing\r\non the soldiers and policemen, would have done more to quell the mob\r\nthan all subsequent proceedings, and would have saved life in the end.\r\nIt would have forced the inhabitants of these houses who, as things were\r\nconducted, could safely give all possible aid to the insurgents, to\r\ncompel these to lay down their arms, in order to insure the safety of\r\nthe sympathizers. Had the first, and the second, and the third house\r\nfrom which the assassins were permitted to fire been battered to the\r\nground with cannon shot, the last two days of fighting would have been\r\nunnecessary. The police cowed the mob wherever they met them, because\r\nthey showed no quarter. They hit hard and they hit often. They felt that\r\nthe way to knock the riot in the head, was to knock the rioters in the\r\nhead. And they did it, as Inspector Carpenter says, 'beautifully.' New\r\nYork feels as proud of these Metropolitan policemen as he does; and that\r\nis saying a great deal.\r\n\r\nWe discover, then, by this brief analysis of the great riot, that social\r\noutbreaks of this kind have their _immediate_ and _tangible_ causes,\r\nwhich are superficial in their character, and vary with the occasion;\r\nthat these causes depend for their disturbing power upon others which\r\nare more _fundamental_, and which inhere in the nature of our present\r\nsocial relations; that so long as the wealthy and intelligent classes\r\nshall decline the permanent guardianship and organized care of the poor\r\nand ignorant masses, the liability to such recurrences will remain; that\r\nwhen they break forth, the safety of community and mercy to the rioters\r\nalike demand that the mob be scattered on the instant by an iron and\r\nrelentless hand; and, finally, that the only method by which society\r\nwill be permanently and effectually freed from a liability to the\r\nterrors of mob-rule, is the reorganization of its economical\r\narrangements in such a manner that the miseries of poverty and ignorance\r\nshall be forever removed from the community, and a social providence be\r\nfirmly established which shall secure physical comfort and kindly\r\nsympathy to all classes of citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DESERTED HOUSE.\r\n\r\nA PRE-RAPHAELITE PICTURE FROM NATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n       It was left long ago,\r\n       And the rank weeds grow\r\n   Where the lily once bent her head;\r\n       Thick and tall they grow,\r\n       And some lying low,\r\n   Beaten down by a human tread.\r\n\r\n       And the laughing sun,\r\n       When the day's nearly done,\r\n   Looks in on the cheerless floor;\r\n       And falleth the rain\r\n       Through the broken pane--\r\n   Shrill whistles the wind at the door.\r\n\r\n       And the thistles stand\r\n       At the gate where no hand\r\n   Ever lifts the latch, now nailed fast:\r\n       One gate low doth lie\r\n       Which the passer by\r\n   Treads o'er as he hurries past.\r\n\r\n       On the fence close by\r\n       Where the sunbeams lie\r\n   Doth the kingly Nightshade blow;\r\n       But the Asters tall\r\n       That grew by the wall\r\n   Have vanished long ago.\r\n\r\n       Not now, as of old,\r\n       Blooms the gay Marigold,\r\n   Looking in at the kitchen door;\r\n       And the Cypress red\r\n       Is long since dead,\r\n   And the Monkhood blossoms no more.\r\n\r\n       But the Hopvine still\r\n       By the window sill\r\n   Is as full as in days of yore;\r\n       And the Currants grow\r\n       As thickly now\r\n   And as ripe as e'er before.\r\n\r\n       But the hearth is bare--\r\n       Not a log blazes there\r\n   To light up the empty room:\r\n       Not a soft shadow falls\r\n       On the whitewashed walls:\r\n   All is silent--all wrapt in gloom!\r\n\r\n       Not a chair on the floor,\r\n       Not a rug at the door,\r\n   Where the cat once lay in the sun;\r\n       And no grandame sits\r\n       At the door and knits,\r\n   Telling tales of days bygone!\r\n\r\n       All is silent now,\r\n       And the long weeds bow\r\n   Their heads in the wind and rain;--\r\n       But the dwellers of yore\r\n       Will ne'er enter the door\r\n   Of that dreary old House again!\r\n\r\n                                         E. W. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRING MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Race Miller, indeed! why don't you say Jim Burt at once? I think I'd\r\nbetter go live in Rocky Hollow, and weave baskets for a living; hadn't\r\nI?'\r\n\r\n'Well, Dimpey, the race is not _always_ to the swift, you know; so you'd\r\nbetter look out in time;' and Polly Jane took up her pan of peas, and\r\nwent laughing into the kitchen. I suppose she thought she had said\r\nsomething smart, as our name is _Swift_; and perhaps she had; but it\r\nmade me as mad as hops, I won't deny it, though I _am_ a minister's\r\nniece! So I pulled my sunbonnet over my face, and went to weeding the\r\nflowerbeds, to get cool. It was going on to noon, and the sun was baking\r\nhot, but I didn't mind that; I could _not_ shell peas in the same pan\r\nwith Polly Jane while I felt so provoked.\r\n\r\nI _do_ think that Race Miller is one of the homeliest young men I ever\r\nset my eyes on: if I say so _now_, you may be sure it's true. His skin\r\nis almost as dark as an Indian's, and his hair curls up as tight as\r\nwool--you couldn't straighten it if you brushed his head off. Then his\r\neyes are blue and twinkly, and he has a short nose, and a great, broad\r\nmouth, that, whenever he laughs, opens wide enough to swallow you; to be\r\nsure, it is filled with nice, white teeth, and has a good-natured\r\nexpression; but his teeth are so strong they look as if they could bite\r\nthrough a tenpenny nail; and when he answers out in Bible class, and\r\ncomes to the long words, such as 'righteousness' and 'Jerusalem,' it\r\nreally seems as if they were something good to eat, he crunches them so\r\nwith those great teeth of his!\r\n\r\nYou'll wonder how he came to have such a ridiculous name as _Race_. His\r\nmother named him Horace, after somebody in a book, but as none of her\r\nconnection owned the name, nor anybody else in this part of the country,\r\nit didn't come natural to call him by it, so they shortened it down to\r\nRace, to make it handy. I suppose _I_ oughtn't to say much about names,\r\nhowever, for _Dimpey_ don't amount to much; but that isn't _my_ fault; I\r\nwas christened with a right pretty name--Phebe Ann! but Cousin Phebe\r\nlived with us when I was little, and it made a sort o' confusion to have\r\ntwo of us, and my cheeks were so full of dimples that Calanthy--she's\r\nthe oldest of us children, and has kept house ever since mother\r\ndied--well, she called me Dimpey, and the rest took it up, and so I\r\nsuppose I shall be Dimpey Swift to the end of the chapter--that is, not\r\nDimpey _Swift_ exactly; but I forgot, I was telling about Race Miller.\r\n\r\nI was so vexed with Polly Jane for even hinting that he was a match for\r\n_me_, that I jerked out the weeds with all my might, and I do believe\r\nour Persian pink border never was so clean before or since; when I came\r\nin, there wasn't a weed left in it, big or little!\r\n\r\nNow the fact was, I couldn't help knowing I was _tolerable_ good-looking\r\nby the way the boys manoeuvred 'round to walk home from singing school\r\nwith me, and by their staring at me in meeting when they ought to have\r\nbeen looking at the minister. I used to try and keep my eyes fast on my\r\nhymn book, but it seemed as if I could see right through the lids; and I\r\nknew well enough that when Ned Hassel bent down his head and pretended\r\nto be picking out his notes in 'Sacred Psalmody,' he was peeping at _me_\r\nall the time. I suppose I was a little spoiled by having so many beaux,\r\nfor Calanthy was a regular old maid: you mustn't ever mention it, but\r\nshe'd been disappointed once, and wouldn't keep company with anyone\r\nafter that; and Polly Jane had only one sweetheart, and I didn't think\r\nmuch of him, though he _was_ the schoolmaster, and knew more than all of\r\nus put together. He was kind-a slow in his speech, and a good deal bald;\r\nhis hair never came in right well after he had the typhus fever; but\r\nJohn Morgan was a real good fellow for all that, and I was a little fool\r\nnot to know it.\r\n\r\nWell, I stooped over the flower beds till I was tired and 'most melted,\r\nand I was just thinking of giving up, when Calanthy called to me from\r\nthe kitchen door, 'Don't stay out in the sun any longer, Dimpey; you'll\r\nhave time to cool before dinner, for father hasn't come in yet.'\r\nCalanthy always petted me considerable, for I was only a year old when\r\nmother was taken away, and Calanthy had to bring me up, and teach me\r\neverything about the house.\r\n\r\nSo I went through the garden out into the orchard, and sat down under\r\nthe big Baldwin apple tree, to rest; it was a nice, shady spot, and\r\nthere came up a breeze off the river t'other side the meadow, where\r\nfather and the boys were mowing. The air smelt as sweet as could be of\r\nthe new hay, and I took off my bonnet and sat down on the grass, and\r\nleaned my head against the tree; the bees were humming in the clover,\r\nand the sound made me sleepy, and I believe I must have dozed while I\r\nwas sitting there. I don't know how it was, but all at once I saw a\r\npicture in my mind: I couldn't get rid of it, try my best. It happened\r\nlong ago, when I was a little bit of a thing, but it all came back to me\r\nunder that apple tree. It was when our old mare Peggy took fright at a\r\ntin peddler's wagon just as she was crossing the bridge at the foot of\r\nSmith's hill; what ailed the creature I can't tell, for she's as steady\r\nas clockwork generally. Dear me! I've ridden her ever since I was _so_\r\nhigh! But perhaps it was the sun shining on one of the tins hanging\r\noutside the wagon, that reflected into her eyes and scared her out of\r\nher wits; at any rate, she gave a sudden spring, and pitched father\r\nright over her head; then she ran home as fast as she could go, and\r\njumped over the fence into the dooryard. Calanthy wasn't well, and when\r\nshe saw old Peggy come tearing along the road without father, she\r\nfainted away, and Polly Jane caught her as she was falling, and helped\r\nher on the bed in the spare room. I was sitting on a little chair in the\r\nhall, stringing beads; I thought Calanthy was dead, and commenced\r\nscreaming like a catbird; and poor Polly Jane was almost distracted, and\r\ndidn't know which way to turn. Race Miller was a boy about fourteen at\r\nthat time, and as strong as a lion; he happened to be driving down the\r\nhill just as the accident happened, and he and the peddler lifted father\r\ninto his wagon, and Race brought him home and then drove off for the\r\ndoctor as quick as he could; he had two miles to go, but he did it in no\r\ntime, and had the doctor there just as Calanthy fairly came to and was\r\nable to walk about.\r\n\r\nWell, father wasn't hurt as bad as we thought--only stunned by the fall;\r\nhe had a bad bruise on his cheek, though, and Dr. Basset said he must\r\nkeep still on the bed all day, and have his face bathed with laudanum\r\nand vinegar. They were all so busy that no one thought about _me_, till\r\nRace came out of father's room and found me sitting on the low chair,\r\nrocking my doll in my arms, and crying as if my heart would break; I had\r\nfelt so lonesome and miserable that I was holding the doll for company;\r\nand when Race saw me he said, 'Why, what's the matter with little\r\nDimpey?' 'Is father dead?' said I; 'can't I go and see him?' Then Race\r\ntold me father was better, and that I must not cry, and this made me cry\r\nmore; so he took me up in his arms, doll and all--I well remember how\r\nstrong his arms felt--and sat down in the big rocking chair in the\r\nparlor; and when the house was quiet, and Calanthy came to look for me,\r\nthere she found us, I with my arms round Race's neck, and the dolly\r\nhugged up tight, and all three of us fast asleep!\r\n\r\nBut this was long ago, and I was a woman now, and a good deal sought\r\nafter, as I said before, and some of my beaux were well off and good\r\nlooking; and, if the truth must be spoken, Race had not paid me much\r\nattention lately, and did not seem to think as much of me as Ned Hassel\r\ndid, and the other young men of our place. To be sure he worked very\r\nhard, for his father was sick a good while and died in debt, and their\r\nfarm was mortgaged to 'Squire Stevens; and as Race was the only child,\r\neverything came upon _him_, and he was in the field early and late,\r\ntrying to pay off the mortgage, and keep the old homestead for his\r\nmother. He _was_ a good son--that everybody said; but he didn't visit\r\n'round as much as some.\r\n\r\nI sat so long under the apple tree thinking of all this, that I got\r\nquite cool and comfortable, and when Polly Jane called me in to dinner I\r\nfelt good-natured again.\r\n\r\nWhile we were eating dinner, brother Joe said, 'Dimpey, as soon as we\r\nget through haying the boys are going to have a drive to Spring\r\nMountain, and take the girls up, for a picnic. Ned Hassel started it; I\r\nguess he wants to show off his sorrel horses; but that near horse of his\r\nis as skittish a creetur as ever I see--I wouldn't ride after it, if I\r\nwas you.' 'No, no,' said father; 'Dimpey isn't going to have her neck\r\nbroken by _them_ beasts; Ned always drives 2.40, as he calls it, and\r\nhe'll be sure to race with the other teams if they give him a chance.'\r\n\r\nNow, if there is anything I _do_ like, it is riding behind fast horses!\r\nFather and Joe drive so slow I'd almost as soon walk, but whenever Biel\r\nand I went off by ourselves we made the dust fly a little; it didn't\r\nhurt our horses a bit, for they were in good pasture all summer, and got\r\nas fat as pigs. I thought in a minute how much I'd like to go with Ned;\r\nbut I knew Polly Jane was watching me, go I said, sort o' careless like,\r\n'I guess Ned could keep his horses from running if he wanted to; but he\r\nhasn't asked me to ride yet; it will be time enough to say no when he\r\ndoes.' Biel looked up and gave me a wink, and Calanthy said, 'You must\r\nlet me know a day or two before you are ready, Joe, so that I can get\r\nsome nice things made for you; our biscuits weren't quite light last\r\npicnic, and I felt really ashamed of 'em.'\r\n\r\nCalanthy is so _thoughtful_--I wish I was more like her.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner was cleared away, I concluded I'd walk down to Preston--we\r\nlive about a mile out of the village--and get a new ribbon for my round\r\nhat. I'm so glad the old pokey bonnets are gone but o' fashion--the\r\nround ones are much more becoming to young people. I thought perhaps I\r\nwould meet some of the girls at the store, and hear more about the\r\npicnic--and my hat was getting shabby for want of new strings, whether\r\nor no. Just by the hay scales I met Jim Burt, the lame basketmaker,\r\nshuffling along as usual with his baskets slung on his back. Poor Jim\r\nwas real simple, and couldn't do anything but weave baskets; he and his\r\nmother lived alone in Rocky Hollow, away t'other side of Preston; they\r\nwere as poor as poverty, but Mrs. Burt managed to scramble along\r\nsomehow, and keep a home for herself and Jim; he hadn't wit enough to\r\ntake care of himself, but was very fond of his mother, and would do as\r\nshe told him.\r\n\r\nI said good day to Jim, and was passing on, for I felt in a hurry to get\r\nto the store, when he called after me, 'I say, Miss Dimpey! don't your\r\nfolks want any baskets? Mother's deown sick, and can't drink milk, and I\r\nwant to get her some tea, and I hain't got a cent o' money; she paid\r\neout the last for sugar abeout a week ago.' Poor Jim always speaks as if\r\nhis nose had been pinched together when he was a baby, and had never\r\ncome apart since; but when I turned around he looked so sorrowful, my\r\nheart ached for him.\r\n\r\n'What ails your mother, Jim?' said I.\r\n\r\n'She's got some kind o' fever, and her head aches awful; she wants to\r\ndrink all the time, but she won't eat nothin'. I fried a slice of pork\r\nreal good for her, but she didn't eat a mite!'\r\n\r\n'Well, Jim,' said I, 'go up to our house, and tell Miss Calanthy about\r\nyour mother, and I guess she'll buy a basket; we want a new\r\nclothes-basket, come to think.'\r\n\r\nI walked on, but somehow I did not feel so much like buying ribbons as\r\nbefore I met Jim. I couldn't help thinking of poor Mrs. Burt, without\r\nany comforts for sickness, and no one to take care of her but this\r\nhalf-witted son; however, I comforted myself by supposing the neighbors\r\nwould not let her suffer, and that Calanthy would likely give Jim\r\nsomething good to take to her.\r\n\r\nWhen I got to the store, who should be there but Abby Matilda Stevens\r\nand Rhody Mills! Abby is generally thought _a beauty_, because she has\r\ngreat black eyes that are always so bright and shiny I wonder the hens\r\ndon't try and peck at them; then she is tall and slim waisted, and her\r\nhair is as black as a coal, and longer than common; but I never liked\r\nsuch dreadful _sparkly_ eyes, do you? I think the kind that have a sort\r\no' hazy look come into them--like the pond when a little summer cloud\r\npasses over the sun--are a great deal handsomer. However, I never dared\r\nto say so, for fear people might think I was jealous of Abby Matilda.\r\n\r\nRhody Mills is a very good-natured girl, and always ready for a frolic,\r\nand the moment she saw me she said, 'Here comes Dimpey Swift now;'--they\r\nhad been talking about me, I guess;--'oh, Dimpey, are you going to the\r\npicnic on Spring Mountain?'\r\n\r\n'Our boys were talking about it at noon,' said I; 'I suppose some of us\r\nwill go--Polly Jane or I; I don't much think Calanthy will.'\r\n\r\n'I wish we could go on horseback,' said Rhody; 'that would be real fun;\r\nbut our Will says we must have a wagon to carry the baskets, so we had\r\nbetter all drive.'\r\n\r\n'Who are you going with, Dimpey?' said Abby Matilda.\r\n\r\nI knew well enough _who_ would be likely to ask me, but as I had no\r\ninvitation yet, I answered, 'Oh, Joe or Biel, I suppose; father won't\r\ntrust me with anyone else!'\r\n\r\n'Well, thank goodness, _I_ can ride with whoever I please,' said Abby;\r\n'I should think you were old enough to take care of yourself, Dimpey, if\r\nyou're _ever_ going to be;' and Abby Matilda tossed her head, and rolled\r\nup her shiny eyes in that hateful way she has.\r\n\r\n'_I_ wouldn't ride with some of the boys if they were to ask me, said\r\nRhody; 'Will is a real good hand with horses, and he says that the\r\ntricks some people play with their animals are enough to ruin the finest\r\nhorse ever was raised.'\r\n\r\n'Who do you mean by _some_ people?' said Abby, and she looked right\r\nscornful.\r\n\r\nRhody laughed: 'I didn't mention any names,' said she; 'but I know good\r\ndriving from harum-scarum, wherever I see it.'\r\n\r\n'_I'm_ not afraid to ride behind any horses in _this_ part of the\r\ncountry,' said Abby; 'and I think all cowards had better keep off Spring\r\nMountain!'\r\n\r\nI felt my face turn red; but I wouldn't please the spiteful thing by\r\nsaying a word; so I bought my ribbon and started for home. I had to pass\r\nMrs. Miller's farm on my way, and as I came along by the stone fence, I\r\nheard a great gee-hawing; they had just finished loading up the hay\r\ncart, I suppose, for Hiram--the hired man--turned the oxen toward the\r\nbarn as I came up, and Race stood leaning his arms on the fence, and\r\nlooking up the road; it's likely he was tired and hot, for he seemed to\r\nme uncommonly homely, and I was such a goose then, I thought _looks_ was\r\neverything. He seemed to be thinking mighty hard of something, for he\r\ndidn't see me till I got close to him, and then he gave _such_ a start,\r\nand his face grew redder than ever!\r\n\r\n'Good day, Dimpey!' said he; 'how are all your folks?'\r\n\r\n'Very well, thank you, Race.'\r\n\r\n'Ain't you going to stop and see mother a minute?'\r\n\r\n'I can't, to-day; I've got some sewing to do before dark.'\r\n\r\nThis was nothing but an excuse--I'll own it now; for I knew I could\r\neasily trim my hat next day; but I was so afraid that Race might ask me\r\nto go to the picnic with him, I felt in a hurry to get away; so I said\r\ngood-by pretty quick and went on before Race had time to say anything\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nWhen I got home, the first thing I saw was a new clothes-basket standing\r\non the ironing table; and Calanthy called to me from the hall, 'Run up\r\nstairs and take a rest, Dimpey, for I want you to go to the Hollow after\r\ntea, and see Widow Burt. I guess she's very sick, from what Jim says;\r\nand Polly Jane and you had better go and find out what help she needs.'\r\n\r\nNow I had been thinking all the way from Preston, that Ned Hassel would\r\ncertainly call in the evening, to ask me to the picnic, before the other\r\nboys got a chance. So I expect I answered a little cross, 'Dear me!\r\nCalanthy! 'way down there to-night; won't to-morrow be time enough?'\r\n\r\n'Why, yes, dear,' said Calanthy, 'if you are too tired; but I was afraid\r\nthe poor soul might be suffering, for Jim's nobody in sickness, you\r\nknow; and I don't like to have Polly Jane go alone. Besides, there's\r\nsuch a big ironing to do to-morrow, I can't well spare you in the\r\nmorning.'\r\n\r\nCalanthy spoke so kind, I felt ashamed of my bad temper; so I answered,\r\n'Very well, Calanthy, I'll go to-night; I'm not much tired.'\r\n\r\nAfter tea Polly Jane and I set out; we had a little basket with camphor\r\nand mustard, and other useful things Calanthy had put up for Mrs. Burt:\r\nit is a beautiful walk through the Hollow, and I should have liked it\r\nvery much if my head had not been so full of the picnic that I couldn't\r\nthink of anything else. We didn't go through the village, but turned off\r\nthe main road into a lane that cut off a part of the distance. I was a\r\nlittle ahead of Polly Jane, for she _would_ carry the basket, and we had\r\njust got into the lane when she said to me, 'Look back, Dimpey; here\r\ncomes one of your beaux!' I turned around, and saw Ned Hassel on one of\r\nhis fast horses. He pulled up at the corner and called out--his voice\r\nwas a little too _loud_ and confident like, I must confess--'Good\r\nevening, Polly Jane; good evening, Dimpey; are you going to take a walk\r\nin the woods, so near sundown?'\r\n\r\nIt provoked Polly, I suppose, to hear him speak so bold, for she\r\nanswered, very short, 'No, we're going on an errand.'\r\n\r\nHe didn't seem to notice, but looked at me, and said, 'I was just on my\r\nway to your house, Dimpey, to ask your company to the picnic next week;\r\nI suppose Joe told you about it? We're going to set out early, and have\r\na real good time; I mean to take my fast team and the light wagon, and\r\nwe can get up the mountain before the others have fairly started.'\r\n\r\nPolly Jane spoke up again--she never could bear the Hassels, and always\r\nsaid they were the greatest braggarts in our county: 'That would be\r\ngreat fun, for you and Dimpey to get ahead of all the company! I thought\r\npicnickers always kept together.'\r\n\r\nNed colored up and looked angry, but he only said, 'Will you engage to\r\nride with me, Dimpey?'\r\n\r\nIf Polly Jane had not been there, I should have told Ned to ask father\r\nif I might go; but I couldn't bear to have her think I wanted Ned for a\r\nbeau; so I answered, 'I don't know yet whether I can go or not; I'll see\r\nwhat our folks say.'\r\n\r\n'Well, Dimpey, I'll come over to your house to-morrow night; I guess\r\nyou'll go; good evening,' and away he galloped.\r\n\r\n'_Guess_ you'll go, indeed!' said Polly Jane, as soon as he was out of\r\nhearing. 'I guess she won't go with _you_, Mr. Impudence! You're not\r\ngoing to make a fool of our Dimpey, and break her neck besides, not if\r\nher father knows it, _I_ can tell you.'\r\n\r\nIt isn't often that Polly Jane speaks out so spunky, but I expect she\r\nwas vexed because he didn't answer her; as for me, I could have cried to\r\nthink that things happened so, and I felt almost angry with poor Widow\r\nBurt for being sick, and taking me away from home that evening. It was\r\nawful wicked, but I was well punished for it afterward.\r\n\r\n'It's _too_ bad in you to talk so, Polly,' said I, 'as if I was a child\r\nsix years old! I wonder _why_ it's impudent in Ned to ask me to ride\r\nwith him; you wouldn't say so if it was any one else; but you hate poor\r\nNed--you know you do,' and here I broke down and really cried; but they\r\nwere spiteful tears, after all.\r\n\r\n'There, now, Dimpey,' said Polly Jane--she was over _her_ pet in a\r\nminute--'don't feel bad; I didn't mean to be cross to Ned; but he has\r\nsuch a bold way of talking, as if he thought nobody could refuse _him_,\r\nthat he always makes me angry, and I can't help it. But you _shall_ go\r\nto the picnic, dear, whether he takes you or not; there will be plenty\r\nglad to ask you; so kiss me, Dimpey, and I won't tease you again.'\r\n\r\nI let her kiss me, and then walked on sullen enough till we came to Mrs.\r\nBurt's. The house was a forlorn old place, with only one room and a\r\nbedroom, and a garret next the roof, where Jim slept. The door of the\r\nliving room opened out into a shed, where Mrs. Burt did her work in\r\nsummer time. The trees grew close up to the shed, and the well was under\r\nit; and as we came up, who should I see but Race Miller, drawing a\r\nbucket of water to fill the teakettle, while Jim kindled a fire in the\r\nstove. There _did_ seem to be no end of vexations that day, and I wished\r\nmyself a hundred miles off.\r\n\r\n'Why, Polly Jane! is that you? I didn't think of seeing you down here\r\nto-night--and Dimpey, too! We heard that Mrs. Burt was very sick, and\r\nmother had tea early, and we came over to see how the poor soul was.'\r\n\r\n'Is your mother in the bedroom?' said Polly.\r\n\r\n'Yes; we've fixed Mrs. Burt up in the rocking chair, and mother is\r\nmaking her bed. I want to get a cup of tea made for her as quick as I\r\ncan, for she has a good deal of fever, and is thirsty all the time.\r\nCome, Jim! set on the kettle, and we'll have it boiling in no time.' And\r\nRace stooped down and blew the fire with his mouth till it blazed up\r\nnicely.\r\n\r\n'I'll go help your mother, Race,' said Polly Jane. 'You sit down, and\r\nrest, Dimpey; you've had walking enough to-day;' and she went into the\r\nbedroom, and left me alone with Race. Jim didn't count for anybody.\r\n\r\nRace stepped in the room, and brought out a chair; he put it just\r\noutside the shed door, and said:\r\n\r\n'Sit down there, Dimpey, that's a nice cool place.' I sat down, and he\r\ntook a seat in the doorway, close by me. 'Dimpey!' said he, 'if mother\r\nhadn't wanted me, I meant to go up to your house to ask you if you'd\r\ngive me your company to the picnic on Spring Mountain. You know we talk\r\nof having one next Wednesday, don't you?'\r\n\r\n'_There!_' thought I; 'what am I to do now? I daren't say I'm engaged,\r\nfor fear father won't let me go with Ned Hassel; and besides, I didn't\r\npromise Ned; so it would be telling a lie.' Then I thought how pleasant\r\nit would be to ride with the fast horses, and--I may as well own it--to\r\npass Abby Matilda on the road, and let her see I could do as I pleased,\r\nand that I wasn't a coward, I didn't speak for a minute, and then I\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n'I believe I'm engaged already!'\r\n\r\nThe words seemed to come out before I knew it. Race didn't speak, and I\r\nfelt so guilty I never raised my eyes, but made believe I was sorting\r\nsome wild flowers I'd picked in the Hollow. Jim came out just then with\r\nthe teapot in his hand, and drawled out:\r\n\r\n'That pesky kettle deont bile yet. 'Pears to me it's tarnal long abeout\r\nit; it ollers acts contrairy when mother's in a hurry for her tea!'\r\n\r\nI couldn't help laughing, and as I raised my head, I caught Race looking\r\nat me as if he'd look me through and through. His eyes seemed twice as\r\nbig as common! He got up, however, without saying anything, and went to\r\nmaking the tea, and at that minute Polly Jane came out of the bedroom,\r\nand told us Mrs. Miller thought that Widow Burt ought to be watched, and\r\nsaid she would stay all night if Polly would stay too. 'So,' said Polly,\r\n'if Race will take you home, Dimpey, I'll watch with Mrs. Miller. Race\r\nspoke up quick, and said, 'Certainly; he'd see me home,' and it was\r\ngrowing so late I couldn't say anything against it. As soon as he found\r\nhe could do no more to help them--(he _is_ one of the handiest men about\r\nthe house I ever saw, I must say _that_)--Polly said we'd better go, for\r\nCalanthy might feel uneasy. Before we started, she drew me to one side,\r\nand whispered:\r\n\r\n'Dimpey! I wish you'd tell John Morgan how sorry I am to break my\r\npromise to walk with him to-night; but Mrs. Burt is very sick, and Mrs.\r\nMiller couldn't get along without me.'\r\n\r\nI thought to myself--'What a wicked little thing I am ever to get angry\r\nwith Polly Jane, when she isn't a bit selfish, and always ready to do\r\ngood. It's real hard to give up her walk, for John teaches three\r\nevenings in the week, and can't always get a chance to go with her!' So\r\nI spoke as pleasant as I could, and kissed her for good night, and then\r\nset out to walk home with Race Miller.\r\n\r\nI have been through Rocky Hollow a great many times, but I shall never\r\nforget that walk! The evening was clear and bright, but it was pretty\r\ndark in among the willows. Race put out his hand once or twice to help\r\nme over a big stone or log, and said:\r\n\r\n'Take care, Dimpey! don't go so fast, or you'll hurt your little feet\r\nagainst the stones.'\r\n\r\nMy feet are not so very little, but I expect he thought so because his\r\nown are so big. I suppose it was foolish, but he seemed such a stout,\r\nstrong fellow, I felt as if he wanted to take me up, and carry me like a\r\nbaby; but may be he never thought of such a thing.\r\n\r\nWhen we got out in the road it looked quite light; there was a glow on\r\nthe sky where the sun had gone down, and one bright star had come out\r\njust over Spring Mountain, and seemed as if it was keeping watch over\r\nthe spring--I mean the spring on the top of the mountain that gives it\r\nits name. Everything was still, except the crickets that kept up a great\r\nsinging among the trees. I always liked to be out in the starlight, and\r\nshould have felt happy then, only things had gone crooked with me all\r\nday, and nothing seemed to please me. Uncle Ezra--he's our minister, and\r\none of the best men that ever lived--_he_ says it's always so when we\r\nhaven't done right ourselves--and I really believe it is--for I remember\r\nhow discontented I felt that night.\r\n\r\nPresently Race spoke:\r\n\r\n'See that star over the mountain, Dimpey! don't it look handsome up\r\nthere all alone? By the by, who is going to wait on you to the\r\npicnic--you didn't say, did you?'\r\n\r\nI was so vexed at the question, I'd a great mind to answer,'It's none of\r\n_your_ business, Race Miller, who I go with,' but just then, I can't\r\ntell why, the thoughts I'd had in the morning out in the orchard all\r\ncame back to me, and I remembered how Race had given up coming to ask me\r\nbecause his mother wanted him; and then I thought how good he was to his\r\nmother, and waited on her as if she was a pretty young girl. And what\r\nwould _my_ mother say, if she was living, to hear me speak so. Father\r\nalways said _she_ never gave any one a cross word in her life! I looked\r\nup at the star, and it appeared to me that mother might be up there\r\nwatching me, and knowing all my thoughts; and instead of answering Race,\r\nI put down my head and burst out crying. I'd wanted to have a good hard\r\ncry all day, and now I would have given the world to stop, and I\r\ncouldn't.\r\n\r\n'Why, Dimpey!' said Race, 'what _is_ the matter?'\r\n\r\nI couldn't speak; we were passing a big maple tree, and I stopped and\r\nhid my face against it, so that Race couldn't see it. He let me cry a\r\nfew minutes, and then took hold of my hand as gentle as a little child,\r\nand whispered, 'Don't cry, Dimpey! I can't bear it. I'm afraid I shall\r\ndo something rash, if you don't stop soon!'\r\n\r\nI didn't know what he meant by 'something _rash_,' but his voice sounded\r\nso earnest, it frightened me. I took my hand out of his, and wiped my\r\neyes; and then I said, 'It's very shallow to cry when one's head aches;\r\nbut I couldn't help it.'\r\n\r\n'Does your head ache, Dimpey?' said Race; 'oh, how sorry I am I haven't\r\nmy wagon here. I'm afraid you can't walk home.'\r\n\r\nNow, my head _did_ ache; but it was because I had been crying; but you\r\nsee, if one leaves the truth ever so little, how deceitful one has to be\r\nto keep it up. I felt real _mean_ when Race showed so much concern about\r\nme, and told him I could walk very well.\r\n\r\n'Won't you take my arm?' said he; 'that will help you.'\r\n\r\nI couldn't refuse, though I was dreadfully afraid we might meet\r\nsomebody. We walked on in silence for a while, and I could feel Race's\r\nheart beat against my hand that lay on his arm, for he held me close to\r\nhis side, as if I was in danger of falling. Presently he said:\r\n\r\n'I only asked who you were going with, Dimpey, because I wanted you to\r\nhave a good time; if I can't have _your_ company, I don't care to go;\r\nbut I hoped you would enjoy yourself.'\r\n\r\nRace spoke so honest it made me feel ashamed of my ugly spirit, and I\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n'Edward Hassel asked me to go with _him_; but father's got a notion he\r\ndrives too fast, and perhaps he won't let me ride with him.'\r\n\r\nI felt Race give a kind of shiver; and when he spoke again, his voice\r\ntrembled like everything.\r\n\r\n'Dimpey!' said he, 'you musn't think I'm jealous of Ned; I want to see\r\nyou happy, but I _am_ sorry he asked you first, for it's a dangerous\r\nroad up the mountain, and Ned _does_ drive too reckless, that's a fact;\r\nI hope he don't mean to take them young sorrels of his?'\r\n\r\nNow, I know I ought to have told Race the whole truth; but I was so\r\nafraid he might say something to father; I only answered:\r\n\r\n'Oh, I guess Ned will be careful enough; he goes up to High Farm very\r\noften, and his horses are used to the road.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Race; 'but the worst part is past High Farm; however,\r\nperhaps he'll be careful; so don't say that I interfered, Dimpey; for I\r\ndon't want any words with Ned.'\r\n\r\nHe didn't say anything after that until we got to our gate, and then he\r\nspoke out so sudden, he made me start.\r\n\r\n'Dimpey, if you knew--'\r\n\r\nI don't know what he meant to say, for father was sitting on the\r\ndoorstep, and called out:\r\n\r\n'Is that _you_, Polly?'\r\n\r\n'It's Dimpey, father,' said I. 'Widow Burt is very sick, and needs\r\nwatchers; and Mrs. Miller and Polly Jane are going to sit up with her\r\nto-night.'\r\n\r\nSo we came in; and after talking a few minutes with father, Race went\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nI was up bright and early next morning, and worked as smart as I could\r\nto get things out of the way before Polly Jane came; for I knew she'd be\r\ntired, and she always would take hold till the work was done, no matter\r\n_how_ tired she was. While I was ironing, Calanthy went in the milkroom\r\nto work over the butter, so I had the kitchen to myself; and having no\r\none to talk to me, I kept thinking of all that happened the night\r\nbefore. I had my own share of curiosity, and I couldn't help wondering\r\nwhat Race Miller had been going to say when father interrupted him: 'If\r\nI only knew'--what? Was it something about Ned, or himself? I turned it\r\nover in my mind twenty times, like a sheet of paper; but the same side\r\nalways came up, and there was nothing on it.\r\n\r\nIt was ten o'clock before Polly Jane got home, and I was right glad I'd\r\nworked so hard, for she looked worn out--and no wonder! Calanthy had\r\nsome nice hot coffee and cream cakes ready for her; but she was so\r\nsleepy she could hardly eat anything. She said that Mrs. Burt had passed\r\na miserable night, and toward morning had got out of her head, and was\r\nso wild and restless they could scarcely keep her in the bed. As soon as\r\nit was light they sent Jim for Dr. Basset, and he gave her a strong dose\r\nof morphine. Mrs. Miller had to go home, and when Mrs. Burt fell asleep,\r\nPolly left Jim to watch her--he was as faithful as a dog, poor\r\nfellow!--and went in to Preston to try and get somebody to stay with her\r\nthrough the day. Polly Jane went first to 'Squire Stevens's, thinking\r\nthat Abby Matilda had less housework to do than most of the girls; her\r\nmother kept a hired woman, and perhaps she'd be willing to go for _one_\r\nday; but Abby was afraid of catching the fever, and said 'they'd better\r\nhave Widow Burt taken to the poorhouse at once, for _nobody_ would like\r\nto stay in that damp Hollow and take care of her, poking their eyes out\r\nin the dismal old house!'\r\n\r\n'I was so provoked with the unfeelin' thing,' said Polly Jane, that I\r\ntold her 'I didn't know as the damp would hurt her _bright_ eyes any\r\nmore than my _dull_ ones; and if the house was dismal, so much the more\r\nit needed some one to brighten it up.' I didn't waste many words on her,\r\nhowever, but went on to Mr. Mill's as fast as I could; but for a wonder,\r\nRhody wasn't home; her cousin Hepsy came up from Four Corners the day\r\nbefore, and carried her off to see their aunt Colborn, and she wouldn't\r\nbe home until Saturday. I don't know what's to be done, Calanthy, unless\r\nyou can think of some one we can hire for a nurse; the doctor says Mrs.\r\nBurt's going to have a hard fit o' sickness, and needs good care every\r\nminute.'\r\n\r\nCalanthy sat down on the settee; she isn't very strong, as I told you,\r\nand has to rest considerable; but she's such a good manager, she gets\r\nthrough more work than many a ruggeder one; and when she's puzzled she\r\nalways drops down on that old settee a minute or two, and she's sure to\r\nthink the matter out directly. Presently she said:\r\n\r\n'Why wouldn't Betsy Mix do? She makes store shirts now, you know, and\r\nshe could bring her sewing with her. I dare say she'd like a change of\r\nwork, she _sits_ so much.'\r\n\r\n'Yes!' said Polly Jane; 'but who's to go after her? the boys are too\r\nbusy haying, and want the horses besides; oh, come to think, I guess we\r\ncan manage it. I'll run 'round to the schoolhouse and tell John, and he\r\ncan dismiss a little earlier at noon, and get Mrs. Miller to lend him\r\nher wagon and old Bob. I saw Bob in the pasture as I came along; and if\r\nBetsy will come, John can drive her right down to the Hollow, and she\r\nand Jim can get along to-night, at any rate.'\r\n\r\n'I'll go and tell John,' said I; 'you're too tired, Polly.'\r\n\r\nBut Polly Jane insisted upon seeing John herself; and when I thought of\r\nhis disappointment the night before, I didn't wonder, so I said no more.\r\nCalanthy filled a basket with things to make Betsy Mix comfortable, and\r\nJohn went after her and took her down to Widow Burt's; when he came\r\nback, he said he left Mrs. Burt more quiet, and poor Jim quite happy\r\nhelping Betsy get dinner ready for herself and him. Calanthy had put a\r\ndried apple pie in the basket; and when Jim saw _that_, he sniggered in\r\nhis simple way, and called out:\r\n\r\n'Golly! Miss Mix! a piece o' that air pie will taste good, _weont_ it,\r\nnow?'\r\n\r\nWe all laughed hard at Jim's speech; and then John went away, and Polly\r\nJane consented to lie down and rest.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner was cleared away, I set to work to trim my hat. I'd found a\r\nreal pretty ribbon at the store--brown, with bright blue stripes.\r\nPerhaps I gave a _little_ too much for it; but it was a great deal\r\nhandsomer than the others they had, and then it was a better quality;\r\nand a good ribbon _wears_ twice as long as a poor one, so it comes to\r\nabout the same thing in the end. As soon as I had fastened the rosettes\r\nat the ears, I tried it on to see how it looked. It was so becoming,\r\nthat I thought to myself, 'When I get on my blue muslin, and a white\r\nruffled mantilla, and _this hat_, I shall look as well as any one at the\r\npicnic!' I suppose you think I was a _vain_ little thing, and so I was,\r\nbut I hope I've got over it now.\r\n\r\nPolly Jane had a good long sleep, and woke up as bright as a button.\r\nAnd, when John Morgan came over after tea, they started for a walk, as\r\nhappy as could be. I stood in the door, as they went out the gate, and I\r\nthought, 'John _is_ a good young man, that's certain, but I _do_ wish he\r\nwas rather better looking. I don't see how Polly can fancy him for a\r\nsteady beau.' Just at that minute up galloped Ned Hassel on the gray\r\nsorrel. He saw me at the door, I know, though I ran into the parlor, and\r\ntook up my stocking, and began to knit it as fast as I could. He made\r\nhis horse dance and caper before he got off. More fool he! for father\r\nsat on the porch, and was looking at him all the time! When he came in,\r\nhe had a beautiful color in his cheeks, and his eyes were as bright as\r\ndiamonds; and, as he pushed the hair off his forehead, and said 'Good\r\nevening,' he looked as handsome as a picture, and I thought I was\r\n_almost_ in love with him. Much I knew about love, _then_. But we've all\r\ngot to learn.\r\n\r\nAfter talking to father and the boys about the harvest, and the\r\nelection, and such things, he turned to me and said:\r\n\r\n'Will you ride with me to the picnic, next week, Dimpey?'\r\n\r\nI looked at father, and he answered:\r\n\r\n'I think you've chosen a dangerous place for your picnic, Ned! When\r\nyoung people get in a frolic, I'd rather it wouldn't be on Spring\r\nMountain.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! there's no danger,' said Ned, 'I go up to High Farm two or three\r\ntimes a week, and I never had any accident.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said brother Joe, 'but we're not going to have the picnic at High\r\nFarm. The road does well enough till you get past there; and _I_ think\r\nwe'd better walk the rest of the way.'\r\n\r\n'How would we get the provisions up, I wonder?' said Ned. 'It would\r\nbreak our backs to lug the baskets to the top of the mountain. I, for\r\none, wouldn't undertake it at _any_ price!'\r\n\r\nFather looked vexed, and said, 'Young men's backs must be weak\r\nnow-a-days. I think it's a risky thing to drive up to the Spring, and\r\nI'd rather Dimpey wouldn't go _this_ time.'\r\n\r\nI felt the tears come in my eyes, and I couldn't speak. Ned turned very\r\nred, and said nothing for a minute or two; then he spoke quite mild and\r\npleasant:\r\n\r\n'Can't you persuade your father to let you go with me, Dimpey? I promise\r\nto take the _best_ of care of you!'\r\n\r\nI suppose father noticed that I felt bad, for he said, 'Do you want to\r\ngo very much, Dimpey?'\r\n\r\nI stammered out, 'Yes, sir, I'd like to go with the rest, if you was\r\nwilling.'\r\n\r\n'Well then, Ned,' said father, 'Dimpey may go, on one condition, that\r\nyou drive your brown mare, and not either of them young horses.'\r\n\r\n'The brown mare!' said Ned. 'Why, she's the slowest old poke in the\r\ncounty. It would take her till sundown to get there, and there wouldn't\r\nbe much fun in that!'\r\n\r\n'Very well,' said father, quite determined like, 'I shan't risk my\r\nDimpey's neck on top of Spring Mountain after anything faster. So you\r\ncan do as you please.'\r\n\r\nNed started up, and went right out the front door without saying a word!\r\nI couldn't believe my senses, that he was going off in that way--so\r\ndisrespectful to father! I heard him speaking to his horse; and Bill\r\nremarked, 'Well, I've seen _manners_ before, but this beats all!' Father\r\ndidn't open his lips; and, in a few minutes, Ned came back, and stood in\r\nthe doorway.\r\n\r\n'I thought that Lightning had got unhitched,' said he, 'but he's only a\r\nlittle uneasy. Good night, Mr. Swift, I'll be up here with the brown\r\nmare bright and early next Wednesday. The boys agreed to meet at the hay\r\nscales, at ten o'clock, and start from there, but the mare's so slow,\r\nI'll have to be in time. Could you get ready by half past nine, Dimpey?'\r\n\r\nI said I could, and felt very happy that Ned had come back. So he said\r\ngood night to me and the boys, and went off. When he was gone, Joe spoke\r\nout:\r\n\r\n'I wonder if one of the Hassels ever told the truth; if he did, I guess\r\nit was by accident. Ned knew well enough that nothing ailed his horse,\r\nbut he was so mad, he had to go out doors, for fear he'd boil over. If I\r\nwas you, Dimpey, I wouldn't encourage him to come here much; for he's as\r\ndeceitful as a cat-a-mountain!'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said father, 'I am afraid he's a chip of the old block; but I've\r\npassed my word you shall go with him, Dimpey, and I won't take it back,\r\nthough I'd rather see you keep company with any other young man in\r\nPreston; that's a fact! I promised your Uncle Ezra I'd never have any\r\nmore angry words with old Hassel, and I don't mean to. But I don't care\r\nto have any further dealings with the family than I can help. They're a\r\nslippery set. Reach me the Bible, Dimpey! and I'll get ready for bed.'\r\n\r\nSo father read the psalm, 'Fret not thyself because of evil doers.' I\r\nthink he picked it out on purpose; and then he prayed that we might all\r\nlead better lives, and live in Christian fellowship with each other.\r\n\r\nNow the truth was, he and Mr. Hassel had quarrelled long ago, about some\r\nland that Mr. Hassel had sold him. The title wasn't good, and father\r\nalways thought Mr. Hassel knew it when he sold the land. They had a\r\ngreat many words about it, and put it into law; and father went to a\r\ngood deal of expense and trouble. He and Mr. Hassel didn't speak for\r\nsome time. But Uncle Ezra talked to him, and got him to be reconciled to\r\nhis enemy. It all happened when I was a child, and I never just knew the\r\nrights of it. But I know that father was very glad when Mr. Hassel sold\r\nhis farm joining ours, and bought another at the foot of Spring\r\nMountain, where he has lived ever since. It troubled me very much that\r\nour folks felt so set against the family; for Ned was the best-looking\r\nyoung man in our place, and had such a dashing sort of a way with him,\r\nthat he took my fancy considerable, and I must confess I was rather\r\nblind to his faults. I went to sleep that night with my head full of\r\nthe picnic, and dreamed that I rode up the mountain on Ned's Lightning,\r\nand just as I got to the steepest part, the horse gave a jump, and\r\ntumbled me over its head right down the side of the mountain; and as I\r\nfelt myself rolling down, down, down, I screamed so that I woke myself\r\nup, and Calanthy too, who ran in from her room to shake me. I often\r\nscream out in that way, if I have a bad dream. But I didn't tell the\r\ngirls what I was dreaming about.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, as soon as the work was done, Polly Jane said she\r\nwould go down to Rocky Hollow, and see how Widow Burt was getting on,\r\nand if Betsy Mix could do for her. She didn't get back to dinner, and\r\nCalanthy began to feel so uneasy, she said she would go herself and see\r\nwhat was the matter. I begged her to send _me_ instead, for I knew she\r\ncouldn't bear such a long walk in the middle of the day. Father and the\r\nboys had both our steady horses in the hay field, and I couldn't drive\r\nthe colt, so there was no way to ride. So at last she consented I should\r\ngo, but told me to take her big parasol, and get back as soon as I\r\ncould. When I got near the Hollow, I met Dr. Basset. He stopped his\r\nhorse and said:\r\n\r\n'Mrs. Burt is very sick, Dimpey; and I'm going after a woman to help\r\nBetsy Mix take care of her. She can't get along without help. Polly Jane\r\nwill stay till sundown, but _you_ can't do any good. So, you'd better\r\nget in, and ride back with me; I'm going past your house.'\r\n\r\nI was glad of a chance to ride home, so I got in the wagon, and asked\r\nDr. Basset if he thought Widow Burt wouldn't live?\r\n\r\n'I can't say for _that_,' said he; 'but she's a mighty sick woman _now_.\r\nShe was out of her mind all last night, and I don't know what Betsy\r\nwould have done if Race Miller hadn't come in. He saw how Mrs. Burt was,\r\nand stayed through the night, and he's so strong he could hold her when\r\nBetsy couldn't manage. Once she jumped out of bed, and wanted to go sit\r\nin the Hollow, and poor Jim would have let her climb a tree if she had a\r\nmind to. But Race lifted her back in the bed, and sang hymns to her till\r\nshe was quiet. You know what a good voice he has. Betsy says it seemed\r\nto act like opium on Mrs. Burt!'\r\n\r\n'What would become of Jim if she should die, doctor?' said I.\r\n\r\n'The Lord only knows, Dimpey. I'm afraid he'd have to go to the\r\npoorhouse. I always hoped he'd be taken _first_; but we don't know what\r\nis best, and God does.'\r\n\r\nDoctor Basset is a real feeling man. I can't see what Preston would do\r\nwithout him. So he took me home, and, after tea, Biel harnessed the\r\ncolt, and went after Polly Jane. She said that Doctor Basset had been\r\nover to Pine Hill, and brought Mrs. Jessop back with him. She's a\r\nstrong, hearty woman, and has had experience in fevers, and knows just\r\nwhat to do. The doctor told Jim he must mind what she said, if he wanted\r\nhis mother to get well; and she had set him to work directly, as it was\r\nbetter to keep him busy.\r\n\r\n'But,' said Polly Jane, 'I never saw such a fellow in time of trouble as\r\nRace Miller. He had been busy by daylight clearing up around the house,\r\nand making things look comfortable. You'd hardly know the old place if\r\nyou could see it now. He came in again this afternoon, and I told him I\r\ndidn't know how he could spare so much time from his own work; but he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n'Why, you know, Polly, I've let out a part of our farm on shares this\r\nyear, so I haven't as much hay to get in as usual, and I finished haying\r\nyesterday. Besides, Hiram is a right smart fellow, and won't neglect\r\nanything if I _am_ away.'\r\n\r\nHe wouldn't take any credit for what he'd done, but I thought to myself,\r\n'I should think that any man who wasn't a real _shirk_, would be\r\nashamed not to be smart if _you_ was looking at him!'\r\n\r\nThis was Wednesday. Mrs. Burt's fever never broke till next Monday,\r\nwhich was the ninth day, and then she was so weak they hardly dared\r\nspeak in her room, and the doctor said her life depended on good\r\nnursing. Betsy Mix gave out, and went home; but Mrs. Jessop stayed. She\r\ncould get along if any of the neighbors would come in for a few hours\r\nevery day, and let her go to sleep. So, Mrs. Miller and Polly Jane\r\nhelped her; and when Rhody Mills got back she went right out to the\r\nHollow, and insisted on watching one night. The neighbors all sent\r\nthings to keep the pot boiling, and I don't believe poor Jim ever lived\r\nso well or saw as much company in his life before. 'Squire Stevens's\r\nfolks didn't help any, except one day Mrs. Stevens sent a loaf of bread\r\nthat was so heavy Mrs. Jessop gave it to the pig. But then some people\r\nnever have their bread _light_, you know; and perhaps she sent the best\r\nshe had.\r\n\r\nWell, Wednesday was the day for the picnic! John Morgan wanted to hire a\r\nwagon, and take Polly Jane; but she was tired going backward and forward\r\nto Rocky Hollow, and didn't care to go. Joe and Biel drove our steady\r\nhorses, and Cousin Nancy and Rhody Mills went with _them_. I couldn't\r\nfind out if Race Miller was going or not; but I didn't hear of his\r\ninviting anybody else. Calanthy roasted a nice pair of chickens for us,\r\nand her biscuits were as light as a feather _this_ time, and I made some\r\n_real nice_ cake, and Calanthy iced it for me; it looked beautiful!\r\nPolly Jane came home from the Hollow Tuesday afternoon, and said that\r\nWidow Burt had her senses, and was lying still and comfortable. She\r\nappeared to know all that had been done for her, and was very thankful;\r\nbut Dr. Basset had forbidden her to speak much. He let her take hold of\r\nJim's hand and tell him she felt better, and the poor fellow went out in\r\nthe shed, and cried like a baby. Race Miller stepped in just then. He\r\nalways seemed to happen along at the right minute, and he set Jim to\r\nwork cleaning some fish he'd caught. The thought of a good dinner soon\r\nmade Jim laugh again; but that's the way with simpletons, you know.\r\n\r\nI do believe there never _was_ a lovelier morning than that Wednesday.\r\nIt was as clear as a bell, but not nearly as hot as the week before. If\r\nthe day had been made on purpose for a picnic, it couldn't have been a\r\nbetter one. I felt so glad Widow Burt was like to get well, and that\r\nfather had consented to let me ride with Ned Hassel, and that my cake\r\nwas so handsome, and everything else so good, I didn't know how to be\r\nhappy enough! I went singing about the house till it was time to dress\r\nmyself, and when I got on my blue muslin and my clean white mantilla,\r\nand had smoothed my hair till it shone like satin under the new rosettes\r\nin my round hat, I _did_ think I looked pretty nice. I couldn't help it;\r\nand when Ned drove up a little after nine o'clock, I felt as if all was\r\ngoing right at last. The girls kissed me good-by, and when father helped\r\nme in the wagon, I saw the tears standing in his eyes. He always said I\r\nfavored mother very much, and I suppose he was thinking of _her_. He\r\nonly said:\r\n\r\n'Take good care of Dimpey, Ned!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir,' said Ned, 'I will.'\r\n\r\nAnd as I took my seat at his side, he whispered:\r\n\r\n'If there's a prettier girl at this picnic than Dimpey Swift, I'd like\r\nto see her. You look like an angel, Dimpey! but I hope you haven't any\r\n_wings_, for we couldn't spare you just now!'\r\n\r\nI was delighted at this nonsense; but I was young and foolish, and\r\ndidn't sense what a goose Ned was with all his fine compliments.\r\n\r\nThe brown mare went along so fast, I thought we would not be much behind\r\nthe rest of the company after all; and when we got to the hay scales,\r\nthere was no one there! Ned stopped a minute, and then he said:\r\n\r\n'Dimpey, I've got some currant wine in my basket; but I forgot the wine\r\nglasses. I think we'd better drive on to our house and get them, and we\r\ncan wait there till the others come up.'\r\n\r\n'But,' said I, 'you appointed to meet _here_. Won't they wait for you?'\r\n\r\n'That's true. Just hold the lines, and I'll run in to Mr. Smith's, and\r\nask him to tell them we've gone on, and will meet them at the foot of\r\nthe mountain.'\r\n\r\nSo Ned ran in to Mr. Smith's, and out again in two seconds, and when he\r\ntook the lines, he started off at such a rate, I wondered what possessed\r\nhim, as we had plenty of time. However, I like to ride fast, as I said\r\nbefore; and to tell the truth, Ned was talking to me all the way about\r\n'my beautiful eyes, and how proud he should feel if he had a wife with\r\n_my_ complexion;' and he asked me, 'if I didn't think we'd make a\r\nhandsome _team_ if we were in one harness,' and all _such_ speeches, so\r\nthat I got quite bewildered-like, and might have been riding behind a\r\nhumpbacked camel without knowing it!\r\n\r\nWhen we got to Mr. Hassel's, the old man was sitting on the steps\r\nreading the newspaper. He came to the gate to speak to us, and Ned said:\r\n\r\n'You had better go in, and wait, Dimpey; the boys will not be here yet a\r\nwhile, and I want to fix my wagon more comfortable before we start to go\r\nup to the mountain.'\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Hassel helped me out, and asked me into the house. I should have\r\nliked to stay on the steps, where I could see the picnickers as they\r\ncame along; but he went into the living room, which was at the back of\r\nthe house, and I followed him. I sat down, and he began to talk of all\r\nsorts of things. I answered as well as I could, and pretty soon I heard\r\nsome one shout at the front gate:\r\n\r\n'Hallo, Ned! here we are! Where's your team?'\r\n\r\nI heard Ned answer: 'Hallo!' and then run around the house. I couldn't\r\nhear what more he said; and then there was a great laughing, and a\r\nscraping of wheels, as if they were all driving past. I sat still,\r\nwondering why Ned didn't come for me. My face was so red when I went in\r\nthe house, that I hardly dared to look at Mr. Hassel; but now I looked\r\nup suddenly, and he sat looking at me with such a strange sort of smile,\r\nI didn't know what to make of it. It's likely he knew well enough--but\r\nnever mind that _now_.\r\n\r\nPresently there was a great cracking of a whip and a whoaing in the door\r\nyard. I heard wheels moving fast, and Ned looked in the room, and said:\r\n\r\n'Come, Dimpey! let's be off; the boys have gone on ahead, but we'll soon\r\ncatch them up.'\r\n\r\nI followed him out to the gate; the wagon was there, and I was\r\nastonished to see a _pair_ of horses harnessed to it, and a man standing\r\nat their heads; but before I had time to think, Ned had lifted me in,\r\njumped into his seat, and taken up the lines. We were off like a shot,\r\nand I was actually riding behind the fast sorrels!\r\n\r\n'Oh, Ned!' said I, 'what _does_ this mean? Didn't you promise father you\r\nwouldn't drive these horses?'\r\n\r\n'No,' said he, 'I didn't make any promise. I only said I'd be at your\r\nhouse with the brown mare, and so I was; but I never said I'd drive her\r\nup the mountain. The sorrels will go nicely, and the boys won't say\r\nanything to your father, if you're not afraid.'\r\n\r\n'But what would father say if he knew it; and Calanthy, too! Let me get\r\ndown, Ned. I can't ride with you.'\r\n\r\nBut the more I begged, the louder Ned laughed and urged his horses. The\r\nground seemed to fly from under the wagon, and in few minutes we caught\r\nup to the company. Now I know I ought to have told brother Joe I was\r\nriding against my will, and that I should have jumped out the moment I\r\ngot a chance, but I could not bear to let the girls know how Ned had\r\nacted. So I sat still while he drove past them all; and I was even\r\nwicked enough to feel a little proud as we passed Abby Matilda and her\r\nbeau! Ned kept making love to me all the way up to the farm. It sounded\r\nwell enough _then_, but it makes me sick to think of it now. The horses\r\nwent along like kittens, and he seemed to have complete management of\r\nthem, and when he came to steep places, he drove so carefully that I\r\ncould not feel as if there was any danger. It was very cool and pleasant\r\namong the trees, and everything smelled so fresh and sweet, it was\r\ndelightful riding, and I tried not to think about father. Most of the\r\ncompany left their wagons at High Farm, and walked the rest of the way;\r\nbut John Mills and Abby Matilda drove up to the top of the mountain, and\r\nso did a few others. We got safely to the spring, and when Ned helped me\r\nout of the wagon, he said:\r\n\r\n'There now, Dimpey! don't the sorrels go beautiful? Your hair is just as\r\nsleek as when we started, and your cheeks are only a little redder, but\r\nthat don't hurt 'em any.'\r\n\r\nAs he lifted me down, his face touched mine for a minute. I don't know\r\nthat he did it on purpose, but I shouldn't wonder! I was glad to stoop\r\ndown to the spring, and wet my cheeks, for they felt hot enough by this\r\ntime. However they had time to get cool while Ned was unharnessing his\r\nhorses, and presently Abby Matilda and her beau came along.\r\n\r\n'Dear me, Dimpey,' said she, 'have you really got here without breaking\r\nyour bones, and with Mr. Hassel's wonderful team, too?'\r\n\r\nI was so provoked at the mean thing--I know she was jealous because Ned\r\ndidn't ask _her_--that I never said a word; but Ned answered:\r\n\r\n'My horses are not in the habit of breaking anybody's bones, Miss Abby,\r\nand if they were, they wouldn't pick out the belle of Preston to\r\npractise on--not while I'm master.'\r\n\r\nAbby colored up, and flirted her head, as she always does when she's\r\nangry; but the rest of the company began to come up, and nothing more\r\nwas said.\r\n\r\nI'm not going to tell you much about the picnic, though it was a real\r\nnice one, and in such a beautiful place. Every one says there's one of\r\nthe handsomest views in the world from Spring Mountain; you can see five\r\nvillages, and the river winds so pretty among the hills; then you can\r\ncount a great many church steeples, and there are such noble trees up\r\nthere, and nice, shady places, and rocks to sit on, that it's the very\r\nspot for a picnic. We played plays, and told stories, and sang\r\nconsiderable; our Biel is a funny little fellow, and can imitate almost\r\nany animal: he kept us all laughing, till even Abby Matilda forgot her\r\nairs, and was quite pleasant. Then we had a right good dinner--cold\r\nchicken, and ham, and tongue, and lots of nice pies and cakes, and\r\nplenty of currant wine and milk punch, and the clear, good water from\r\nthe spring. Calanthy's biscuits were so good everybody wanted them, and\r\nmy Washington cake was praised to the skies, and I was as happy as I\r\ncould be.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the dinner our Joe spoke out--Joe _is_ good, but he\r\ndon't always know when to speak.\r\n\r\n'Where is Race Miller, boys? I thought he was coming with us? He didn't\r\nsay nothing to the contrary, the other day.'\r\n\r\nNed Hassel was sitting next to me on the grass; he gave me a nudge, and\r\nanswered, 'I shouldn't wonder if Race has got the mitten from one of the\r\ngirls; I met him early this morning, and he looked as black as thunder.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Abby Matilda--she _must_ have her say--'if I was a man, and\r\nanyone gave me the mitten, I'd have too much spirit to show it by\r\nkeeping away from a picnic!'\r\n\r\n'Pooh!' said Rhody Mills, 'what nonsense! like enough Race is hard at\r\nwork for his mother or somebody else. He's always ready to help anyone\r\nthat asks him.'\r\n\r\nWell, the afternoon passed away, and when the sun began to get low, the\r\nboys said it was time to be going home. While Ned was harnessing his\r\nhorses, something got tangled in the harness, and it took him a little\r\nwhile to fix it, so that the others that were riding started first. I\r\nsaw Joe look back to see if we were coming, and that made me think of\r\nfather again; I had never deceived him in my life, and I couldn't bear\r\nto think of it then; I wondered how Ned would manage, and whether our\r\nboys would tell father about the horses, and I was glad we were behind\r\nthe rest, so that Ned would have to drive slowly, for the road was not\r\nwide enough for teams to pass each other. Now the picnic was over I felt\r\nvery uncomfortable, and blamed myself more and more. However, we started\r\ndirectly, and soon overtook the rest. As we drew up behind the wagon\r\nthat Abby Matilda was in, Ned said, 'What makes you so still, Dimpey;\r\nhaven't we had a real good time?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said I; 'but I was thinking what father will say when he hears\r\nyou took the fast horses, after all!'\r\n\r\n'What will he say? why, nothing, when he sees you safe and sound;\r\nbesides, what's the use of telling him anything about it; he won't ask\r\nany questions when I take you home with the brown mare, and I'm sure Joe\r\nand Biel won't be mean enough to speak of the sorrels.'\r\n\r\nI tried to feel satisfied, though I knew it was wrong; but I thought to\r\nmyself, 'There's no help for it _now_.'\r\n\r\nSo we jogged along slowly till we came to a place where a thick clump of\r\nelders divides the road into two paths; it is just at the steepest part\r\nof the mountain, and the path on the left is very narrow, and right on\r\nthe edge of the precipice. At that minute Abby Matilda looked around,\r\nand called out, in her spiteful way, 'It must be dreadful hard for\r\nThunder and Lightning to keep in the rear; what a pity we can't let you\r\npass us, _Mr._ Hassel!'\r\n\r\nI suppose she vexed Ned, for he answered, 'Perhaps we _can_ do it if we\r\ntry, _Miss Stevens_,' and before I could speak he turned his horses into\r\nthe narrow part of the road! I looked down the side of the mountain, and\r\nit made me feel so sick and giddy that I put out my hands and caught the\r\nlines; this gave them a sudden jerk, the near horse started, and began\r\nto back--Abby screamed, and that frightened him more--I felt the wheel\r\ngoing over the edge--the bushes were close on the other side of the\r\nwagon--there was no place to jump--Ned dropped the lines and sprang out\r\nat the back--I remember seeing something break through the bushes at the\r\nhorses' heads, and that is the last I recollect, for I fainted away and\r\nfell in the bottom of the wagon.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to my senses I felt so strange and confused I did not know\r\nwhere I was; my head had a dull pain in it, and when I touched it, I\r\nfound it was bandaged up, and my forehead felt sore and bruised. Some\r\none took hold of my hand, and I heard a sobbing; I opened my eyes, and\r\nmade out that I was on my own bed at home. Calanthy was standing by me,\r\nand Polly Jane sat by the foot of the bed crying as if her heart would\r\nbreak. I tried to think, but I couldn't get things right; and the picnic\r\nseemed like something that had happened a great while ago.\r\n\r\n'What is the matter, Polly?' said I; 'is anyone hurt? Tell father I\r\ndidn't mean to be deceitful; I'll go tell him myself.' I tried to sit\r\nup, but I fell back on the pillow. Calanthy stooped down and kissed me,\r\nand I heard her say, 'Lie still, my pet lamb. Father isn't angry with\r\nyou; he's stepped out a minute, but he'll be back soon; drink this, and\r\nyou'll soon be better.' She held a cup to my lips; I drank something,\r\nand then fell asleep directly.\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to sit up for several days, and they kept me very still,\r\nand wouldn't let me ask questions; only Calanthy told me that Dr. Basset\r\nsaid I'd had a great shock, and it would take me some time to get over\r\nit. I had a cut on my forehead, too, but it healed up pretty soon. It\r\nseemed as if Calanthy and Polly Jane couldn't do enough for me, and\r\nwhenever father came in the room he was as good to me as ever, and I\r\ncould see that he could hardly keep from crying when I spoke to him.\r\nWhen I got well enough to sit in a rocking chair, and have my knitting\r\nwork, father came in one morning, and brought Uncle Ezra with him. I was\r\nvery glad to see uncle, though I was ashamed to have him know how vain\r\nand wicked I'd been; but I'd thought a good deal while I was sick, and I\r\nmade up my mind to do right, whatever came of it. So I told him how\r\nwrong I had acted, and how sorry I felt for it, and then I asked him to\r\ntell me _how_ my life had been saved, and if any one was killed, and all\r\nabout the accident. I had my memory by that time, and recollected all I\r\nhave been telling.\r\n\r\nUncle Ezra took hold of my hand while I was speaking, and then he said,\r\n'We have great reason to be thankful, my child, that we have you with us\r\nyet; you've had a narrow escape; but I'm sure it will be such a lesson\r\nto you that you'll never disobey your father again. You are young,\r\nDimpey, and may have many years to live; but I hope you'll always be our\r\nown dear honest child, and make as good a woman as your mother was.'\r\n\r\nThen Uncle Ezra told me that when Ned Hassel jumped out of his wagon,\r\nleaving me in it--the coward!--Race Miller pushed his way through the\r\nelder bushes, and caught the horses by their heads. They struggled, and\r\nthrew him down; but the off horse fell with him, and partly on him. This\r\njerked the wagon against the bushes, and the wheel, which was slipping\r\nover the edge of the road, caught against a big stone, which held it a\r\nminute. John Mills had jumped to the ground at that minute. He pitched\r\nthe seat out of Ned's wagon, and he and Biel dragged me out of the back\r\nin less time than it takes to tell it. Then the traces all gave way, the\r\nhorse that had fallen struggled to his feet, the wagon went over, and\r\nclattered down the side of the mountain, and the horses started to run,\r\nbut were stopped by some of the boys who were walking. I had struck my\r\nhead as I fell, and lay senseless, but our boys carried me down to High\r\nFarm, and got a large wagon and a bed to put me on. They _do_ say Joe\r\npushed Ned Hassel out of the way, and dared him to touch me. In the mean\r\ntime, John Mills and the others helped up Race Miller; but one of his\r\narms was broken, and he was so faint he could not stand.\r\n\r\nWhen Uncle Ezra told me this, I burst out crying, and felt as if I\r\nshould die with sorrow; but father comforted me, and said Race was doing\r\nwell, and was as cheerful as ever, and had asked them not to tell he was\r\nhurt, for fear it might worry me. Now wasn't he a noble fellow; and what\r\ndid it matter if he _was_ homely? I felt some curiosity to know what had\r\nbecome of Ned Hassel, for no one had mentioned him while I was sick, but\r\nI didn't like to ask; however, I think father must have known my\r\nthoughts, for just as he was going out of the room, he turned back, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n'If you'd like to know anything about your 2.40 beau, Dimpey, he came up\r\nhere the day after the picnic to ask about you; but I told him your\r\nmother's daughter didn't keep company with liars; and he'd better not\r\nshow his face inside my dooryard, unless he wanted the boys to put him\r\nout. He blustered a little, but I guess he didn't think best to make\r\nmuch noise in _this_ neighborhood; so he took himself off, and that's\r\nthe last of him.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' thought I, _I_ never want to see him again, I'm sure!'\r\n\r\nThe first time I went to meeting was on a pleasant Sunday afternoon, and\r\nif ever any one felt really thankful, I think _I_ did. Uncle Ezra\r\npreached a beautiful sermon, and every word of it seemed as if it was\r\nmeant on purpose for _me_. I hardly dared raise my eyes, but I saw that\r\nMrs. Miller was in her seat as usual, and I heard Race's voice among the\r\nsingers. When we came out, Mrs. Miller walked right up to me, and kissed\r\nme before everybody. I had felt as though she must almost hate me; but\r\nshe looked so pleasant, it brought the tears into my eyes.\r\n\r\n'Do you feel quite strong again, Dimpey?' said she; 'I've heard from you\r\nevery day; but I haven't been up to see you, because I thought you had\r\nplenty of company, and I had my big boy to take care of.'\r\n\r\n'Is Race's arm 'most well?' said I.\r\n\r\n'Here he is,' said Mrs. Miller; 'ask him yourself.'\r\n\r\nI turned around, and there stood Race. His arm was in a sling, and he\r\nwas paler than usual; but he smiled, and his eyes twinkled more than\r\never; and, would you believe it, he actually looked handsome! I tried to\r\nspeak, and thank him for all he had done; but I choked, so I could\r\nhardly say a word. He walked along by my side till we came to our\r\ngate--it isn't far from the meeting house--then he said:\r\n\r\n'Dimpey, will you do me a kindness?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, Race,' I answered; 'I'd do you a hundred, if I knew how.'\r\n\r\n'Well, then, just come over to our house, and take tea with mother;\r\nshe's been waiting on me so long, I want to do something to please her,\r\nand I know you'll brighten her up nicely; _I'm_ such a dull fellow for\r\ncompany, you know.'\r\n\r\nI didn't _know_ any such thing; but I ran and asked Calanthy if I'd\r\nbetter go, and she said 'Certainly.'\r\n\r\nSo I went home with Mrs. Miller and Race, and we had the snuggest little\r\ntea that ever was. Mrs. Miller makes the best muffins I ever tasted, and\r\nshe had some ready mixed, and nothing to do but put them on the griddle.\r\nAfter we had done tea, she told Race to sit down in her big chair by the\r\nwindow, and not to stir out of it till she gave him leave. Then she gave\r\nme an apron, and said I might help her wash up the tea things, if I\r\nliked; of course, I was delighted to do it; and Race sat still, and\r\nlooked at us.\r\n\r\n'What are you smiling at, Race?' said his mother--they always joked\r\ntogether considerable.\r\n\r\n'I was thinking,' said he, 'how funny it seems to sit here and be waited\r\non; take care I don't grow lazy, mother!'\r\n\r\nMrs. Miller laughed, and said: 'Well, I _am_ a little uneasy about\r\nthat--' and just then Hiram came in from milking, and she went into the\r\nmilkroom to strain the milk.\r\n\r\nI was folding up my apron, and I thought I mightn't have another chance\r\nto speak, so I said:\r\n\r\n'I haven't thanked you yet, Race, for saving my life; but you believe I\r\n_am_ thankful, don't you?'\r\n\r\n'Come here, Dimpey,' said he.\r\n\r\nI walked toward him, for I felt as if he had a right to ask me; he got\r\nup from the big chair, and put me gently in it, and then took a little\r\nbench and sat down close to my feet.\r\n\r\n'Are you glad to live, Dimpey?' said he.\r\n\r\nI looked at him in astonishment at such a strange question; but I saw\r\nhis eyes were full, and his lips trembling.\r\n\r\nHe said it again, 'Are you glad your life was spared, Dimpey?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, to be sure,' said I; 'it would have been dreadful to die so\r\nsuddenly; and oh, think how our folks would have felt, if I had been\r\nkilled! And you too, Race! what could your mother do without _you?_ I am\r\nso sorry you were hurt saving _me_, and so thankful it was no worse,'\r\nand here my eyes ran over, and I stopped.\r\n\r\n'Dimpey,' said Race, and his voice shook as it did that night in the\r\nHollow, '_I_ ought to be very thankful for my mother's sake, that God\r\nhas spared my life, and I hope I am _now_; but when I sat in the elder\r\nbushes on Spring Mountain, and saw you sitting by the side of Ned\r\nHassel, and looking so sweet and innocent, I thought that the day you\r\nmarried him would finish all _my_ happiness on earth, and I should have\r\nnothing to live for but to take care of my good mother. You will tell me\r\nthe truth now, Dimpey, I'm sure--will that day _ever_ come?'\r\n\r\n'_Never_, Race!' said I; 'the lying coward! has he _dared_ to say so?'\r\n\r\nI started up from the chair; and, I don't know how it was, I fell into\r\nRace's arms, and he sat down in the chair, and drew me on his knee as he\r\ndid when I was a little child; and looking down on his broken arm, it\r\nseemed to me like my own old dolly, and I put my hands carefully around\r\nit, as I did around my doll in my childish trouble.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is two years now, since Race and I were married; and I believe no one\r\never had a better husband! We live on the old homestead--it is one of\r\nthe pleasantest places in Preston--the mortgage is all paid off, and we\r\nare as comfortable as any family need be. Mrs. Miller is as fond of me\r\nas if I was her own born daughter, and everybody thinks our little Phebe\r\nis almost too sweet to live--she is the picture of Race; but I think her\r\ncurly hair and saucy blue eyes make her the handsomest baby I ever saw.\r\n\r\nWidow Burt and Jim have come away from the Hollow; last year Race put up\r\na new barn, and moved the old one down to the end of the lane--our boys\r\nhelped him fix it up for a house, and Mrs. Burt and Jim live in it. They\r\nmake baskets yet, and we find them very useful when we want extra help.\r\nMrs. Burt is stronger than before she was sick; and poor Jim almost\r\nworships Race, and would run errands all day, if we asked him to--he\r\nthinks there is nothing like our baby on the face of the earth; and\r\nsimple as he looks, she is always ready to go to him.\r\n\r\nRace wouldn't tell me till after we were married, how he came to be\r\nhiding in the bushes on the day of the picnic; he always said I must\r\n_guess_--so you may guess too!\r\n\r\nAfter all, I have reason to bless the day I went up Spring Mountain!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENDURANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n   At first did I almost despair,\r\n   And thought I _never_ it could bear--\r\n   And yet I have it borne till now:\r\n   But only never ask me _how!_\r\n\r\n                                         --HEINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAPANESE FOREIGN RELATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [The article we are now about to offer our readers is from the pen\r\n     of the well-known and highly-esteemed Dr. MACGOWAN, Honorary Member\r\n     of the Archæological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland,\r\n     Corresponding Member of the Société Impériale Zoologique\r\n     d'Acclimation, Asiatic Society of Bengal, of the Agricultural and\r\n     Horticultural Society of India, Ethnological Society of London,\r\n     American Oriental Society, &c., &c., who was for more than twenty\r\n     years a resident of the far East, of China and Japan. He has\r\n     lectured on China and Japan before the most erudite audiences, and\r\n     has never failed to give entire satisfaction. His lectures were\r\n     delivered in New York under the auspices of the Geographical and\r\n     Statistical Society, in compliance with an invitation drawn up by\r\n     Chancellor Ferris, and signed by President King of Columbia\r\n     College, Hon.

Judge Clerke, Hon.\r\n     George Opdyke, and other prominent citizens.\r\n\r\n     At the conclusion of the course, the following resolution,\r\n     presented by the Rev. Dr. Prime, was passed unanimously:\r\n\r\n          '_Resolved_, That this audience has listened with\r\n          great satisfaction, instruction, and delight, to the\r\n          valuable and highly entertaining lectures of Dr.\r\n          MACGOWAN on Japan, and that our thanks are\r\n          eminently due to him for imparting to us in so attractive\r\n          a form the results of his extensive travel, illustrated\r\n          with curious and elegant works of nature and art from\r\n          that remarkable empire.'\r\n\r\n          'On commencing his course of lectures in the Cooper\r\n          Institute, Dr. MACGOWAN was introduced by the\r\n          Hon. Judge Daly, who appeared as the representative of\r\n          the Geographical and Statistical Society. Judge Daly said\r\n          that 'the lecturer came before his countrymen with a\r\n          well-earned European reputation, that his investigations\r\n          had attracted much attention abroad, and in the matter\r\n          of physical geography his researches were referred to\r\n          in Humboldt's _Cosmos_, and his discovery and\r\n          description of the egre or bore of the Tsien-tang River\r\n          in China, occupies a large space in Maury's '_Physical\r\n          Geography of the Sea_.'' Besides giving the Society's\r\n          cordial commendation of Dr. MACGOWAN'S Lectures,\r\n          the Judge expressed on the part of the Society, a deep\r\n          sense of the importance in a national point of view of\r\n          the lecturer's projected exploration in the far\r\n          East.'-_Abridged Report_.\r\n\r\n     We could fill pages with such testimonials.

We therefore call the attention of our readers to the\r\n     present essay, on the important subject of 'Japanese Foreign\r\n     Relations,' as from the pen of one familiar with the history and\r\n     bearing of the questions of which he treats.--ED. CONTINENTAL.]\r\n\r\nStrolling recently from Nagasaki toward the volcanic mountain Simabara,\r\nthe writer was compelled to retrace his steps by the yaconins, or guards\r\nof the prince of Fizen, and thus he failed to accomplish the object he\r\nhad in view--that of searching for the monument erected, it is said, to\r\ncommemorate the expulsion of foreigners from Japan, and the suppression\r\nof Christianity, bearing an impious inscription, forbidding Christians\r\nand the God of the Christians from ever appearing in that 'Eden Minor.'\r\nWhether the monument still exists or not, it is certain that the spirit\r\nof the edict of Gongen Sama, which expelled Europeans forever from the\r\ncountry, and enjoined natives to slay foreigners, still actuates the\r\nruling classes in the insular empire of the Pacific. Hence the\r\nexclamation of the daring and potent prince of Kago, who, in 1853, when\r\nthe American treaty was before the Daimios, in council, placing his hand\r\nupon the hilts of his swords, said: 'Rather than admit foreigners into\r\nthe country, let us die fighting.' He was overruled--a decade has\r\nelapsed, and his forebodings of evil have been realized. One of the\r\nresults of the concession to Americans has been a despatch from Earl\r\nRussell to the British minister at Yedo, which says: 'It would be better\r\nthat the Tycoon's palace should be destroyed than that our rightful\r\nposition by treaty should be weakened or impaired.' When a British\r\nminister threatens to burn a palace, Eastern Asiatics know full well\r\nthat the torch will be preceded by a bombardment and followed by\r\n_looting_, which in Anglo-Indian parlance means plundering. Thirteen\r\nships of war, two of them French, are at Yokahama, within a few hours'\r\nsail of the palace which adorns Yedo, the proud metropolis of the 'Land\r\nof the Rising Sun,' awaiting an answer to a British ultimatum.\r\n\r\nAs the Japanese are neighbors of our countrymen whose homes are on our\r\nPacific coast, we should not be so absorbed in the struggle to maintain\r\nour nationality as to be unmindful of the perils by which they are\r\nsurrounded. While the subjugation of Mexico, by one of the Allied\r\nPowers, which aims at a general protectorate of the East, causes us\r\nanxiety, the prospective invasion of Japan by the other power cannot but\r\nbe regarded by us with solicitude, for in its results it promises to\r\nopen another 'neutral' port to facilitate the operations of other\r\n_Nashvilles_ and _Alabamas_ against our commerce. Assuming that we shall\r\nspeedily avert the impending danger of foreign domination involved in\r\nthe present contest, the various questions affecting American interests\r\nin Eastern Asia become fitting subjects for discussion, and at this\r\nmoment the foreign relations of Japan particularly demand consideration.\r\n\r\nAt one period of their history, the foreign relations of the Japanese\r\nwere of the most amicable character. In their treatment of the Europeans\r\nwho first visited them, they were courteous and liberal. For a period of\r\nninety years the Portuguese carried on a highly lucrative commerce, by\r\nwhich they built up the port of Macao, which has been styled the\r\nbrightest jewel in the Lusitanian crown. To Xavier and his\r\nco-religionists they extended a cordial welcome. Bringing, as did the\r\nmissionaries, a similar but more imposing ritual, with dogmas in many\r\npoints analogous, but accompanied with the sublime teachings of the\r\ngospel, the propagation of the new faith was so facile, that a single\r\ngeneration might have witnessed the nominal christianization of the\r\nentire empire, had not fatal dissensions arisen among the different\r\norders of the Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian missionaries. In\r\nconsequence of these dissensions the country was closed to foreign\r\ncommerce and religion for more than two centuries. A like cause led to\r\nthe closing of China to Christian nations.\r\n\r\nThe edicts of Gongen Sama (founder of the reigning Tycoon family) not\r\nonly prohibited the visit of any foreigner under penalty of death, but\r\ncondemned to death any native who might return to Japan after going\r\nabroad, or being driven to another land by a storm. The vindictive code\r\nwas no _brutum fulmen_, for not long after their exclusion, the Macao\r\nPortuguese despatched an embassy, nearly all the members of which,\r\nincluding attendants and ships' crews, were massacred. Of the sixty,\r\nonly the menials, thirteen in number, were suffered to return.\r\n\r\nA long period of exemption from foreign intrusion followed. With the\r\npresent century commenced a series of private and semi-official visits\r\nfrom various nations. During their seclusion they ceased not to feel an\r\ninterest in Western affairs, but, aided by the Dutch, they studied\r\nphysical sciences and contemporaneous history. Thus they heard of the\r\ngradual approach of the irrepressible foreigner, the opening of China\r\nthrough the Opium War, the acquisition of Hong Kong by the English, the\r\nfrequent appearance of American whalers off their coast, the rise of\r\nCalifornia, and the introduction of steam on the Pacific. These things\r\nmust have suggested to thoughtful observers the necessity of modifying\r\nsome day the institutions of Gongen Sama; indeed, the Dutch state that\r\nthey counselled against resisting the demands likely to be made by\r\nmercantile powers for a relaxation of their prohibitive policy.\r\nTherefore it was that the not unreasonable requirements of Commodore\r\nPerry were complied with, which guaranteed succor and good treatment of\r\ndistressed sailors, and the admission of a consul. This last concession\r\nwas obtained with much difficulty, for they regarded it as an\r\nabandonment of their policy of isolation, and such it proved.\r\n\r\nOur minister, Mr. Townsend Harris (then consul general), succeeded,\r\nafter much resistance from the Japanese, in getting access to Yedo from\r\nhis consulate at Simoda in 1857, his object being to negotiate a\r\ncommercial treaty, which in the following year he accomplished. Many\r\nEnglish writers endeavor to rob Mr. Harris of the honor which he gained\r\nin thus opening an empire to the commerce of the world. The Tycoon\r\nacquiesced, say they, while the echoes of the allied guns in north China\r\nwere booming in his ears. Our minister is represented as holding the\r\nBritish and French fleets _in terrorem_ over the nervous Japanese, and\r\nobtaining, without the cost and odium of an expedition, the same\r\nadvantages as if an American expedition had been despatched, and had\r\nbeen successful. The truth however is, the American treaty was\r\nnegotiated, drawn, and ready for signature before he or they heard of\r\nthe attack on the forts at Taku; and only signed at the appointed time,\r\nafter learning that news. Now, however, finding themselves in a\r\nquandary, we see their highest authorities on this question pleading in\r\nextenuation the circumstance that they were 'driven by the Americans\r\ninto making a Japanese treaty'!\r\n\r\nThe concession made by the Japanese, in the first place--of kind\r\ntreatment of shipwrecked voyagers, and of facilities for the refitting\r\nof disabled vessels--was no more than we had a right to exact; perhaps,\r\nalso, we may be justified in having urged them to admit a resident\r\nofficial agent to protect those interests. But if a nation deems it\r\npolitic to isolate itself from all others, has any state the right to\r\ncompel that nation to abandon its exclusivism, and to receive offensive\r\nstrangers as residents? No publicist will answer this in the\r\naffirmative, nor do statesmen advocate such a claim; yet practically\r\nChristian nations have uniformly acted on the assumption that they might\r\nrightfully force themselves upon an unwilling people. It is however from\r\nthe corollary involved in this assumption that weak peoples are made to\r\nsuffer. It would avail the aggressive power little if its subjects were\r\nrequired to comply with all the laws of the country into which they had\r\nthrust themselves, for in that case the laws could be made to operate so\r\nas to thwart them in every important undertaking. Hence to the right of\r\nresiding in a country contrary to the will of its government is joined\r\nthe correlative, that of compelling the feeble state to abdicate its\r\nsovereignty to the extent of exempting the intrusive foreigner from\r\nlocal jurisdiction--of according the advantage of extra-territoriality.\r\nThe pliant Chinese readily yielded to this new order of things on\r\ndiscovering that foreign nations possessed the will and the power to\r\nenforce it; but the intractable Japanese must have their spirit cowed by\r\nviolence ere they can become resigned to the national degradation. It\r\nwas soon discovered that the measure was highly unpopular: the\r\nfunctionaries who acceded to the demands of the hated foreigner\r\nforfeited their lives or their posts. Nobles who were intensely hostile\r\nto the regime, succeeded to the administration; and on them devolved the\r\ntask of inaugurating a new era, of accommodating the institutions of\r\ntheir country to what they could not but regard as the first stage of a\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nThe delicate undertaking, of reconciling the antagonistic principles of\r\nan encroaching commerce and of a feudal despotism, was committed to two\r\ndiplomatists eminently fitted for its proper performance. Mr. Townsend\r\nHarris, who by long and patient study had conciliated the people and won\r\nthe confidence of the Government, as United States consul general at\r\nSimoda, was appointed as American minister to Yedo; and Sir Rutherford\r\nAlcock, whose experience as a British consular officer in China dated\r\nfrom the period of the treaty of Nanking in 1842, was delegated as his\r\ncountry's ambassador to that metropolis, the capital of the Tycoon.\r\nSeveral difficulties were to be encountered at the threshold. First came\r\na question of currency. Commodore Perry's treaty allowed foreign coins\r\nto be taken at only a third of their value, and under the new treaties\r\nour merchants found that by the rate of exchange the price of native\r\nproducts had been raised fifty to seventy per cent.; on the other hand,\r\nthey were able to purchase gold with silver, weight for weight. The\r\ncorrespondence on this subject, written and verbal, plainly disclosed\r\nthat the free extension of trade was not contemplated by those\r\nislanders. Next we find the Japanese gaining a diplomatic victory in the\r\nlocation of the foreign factories, having managed to have them placed at\r\nYokuhama, instead of Kanagawa, the site stipulated for in the treaties,\r\nan arrangement which serves to isolate and almost imprison the foreign\r\nsettlement; but as Yokuhama was the choice also of the mercantile\r\ncommunity, the ambassadors could not well press their point--it went by\r\ndefault. It is the misfortune of Orientals generally, that in all their\r\ncontroversies with the English, the latter have been the\r\nhistoriographers, and therefore, in almost every step of their\r\naggressive career, appear as disinterested champions of justice, seeking\r\nthe improvement of semi-civilized peoples, by inflicting upon them\r\nwholesome and merited chastisement. Let it be conceded that the charges\r\nagainst the Japanese which we find in the Blue Book and in Sir\r\nRutherford Alcock's 'Capital of the Tycoon,' are all well founded, and\r\nthe resort to strong measures on the part of the British will be\r\nadmitted to be justifiable.\r\n\r\nThese authorities narrate a series of murderous assaults, made upon\r\nRussian, French, Dutch, American, and British subjects in quick\r\nsuccession, indicative, we are assured, of a fixed determination of a\r\npowerful party to restore the regime of Gongen Sama. A party of Russian\r\nofficers were insulted in the streets of Yedo, for which, in compliance\r\nwith the demands of Count Mouravieff, a responsible official was\r\ndegraded. To avenge this disgrace of a Japanese officer, some of his\r\nfriends set upon a Russian officer and his servant, hacking them to\r\npieces in one of the public streets. The next victim was a servant of\r\nthe French consul, who was hewn down and cut to pieces in the street.\r\nThis was soon followed by the murder of the linguist of the British\r\nembassy, a Chinaman; the sword which was thrust through his body was\r\nleft in that position by the assassin. The same night there was an\r\nattempt to fire the residence of the French consul general. Two Dutch\r\ncaptains were next barbarously slaughtered in the streets of Yokuhama;\r\none of the unhappy men was over sixty years of age. The French legation\r\nagain suffered in the person of an Italian servant, who was cut down\r\nwhile quietly standing at his master's gate. Mr. Heuskin, secretary of\r\nthe United States legation, was the first assailed of the diplomatic\r\nbody. He was a valuable public servant, highly esteemed by natives and\r\nforeigners. A native of Holland, he was linguist as well as secretary,\r\nthe Dutch language being the medium of communication. Despite various\r\nwarnings against exposing himself by night, he, on returning home at a\r\nlate hour from the Prussian embassy, was waylaid and hewn down, dying\r\nspeedily of his wounds. Hitherto the English, personally, had escaped\r\nsevere assaults; but, a few months after the assassination of the\r\nsecretary, a midnight attack was made on the British legation, which,\r\nfrom its formidable character, showed that it contemplated the massacre\r\nof the entire body. The assassins met with a spirited resistance from\r\nthe English and their Japanese guard. In that desperate encounter, Mr.\r\nLawrence Oliphant, secretary of legation, was wounded severely, Mr.\r\nMorrison (consul, a son of the celebrated missionary) and two servants\r\nslightly. Of the Tycoon's guard two were killed and fourteen wounded. On\r\nthe part of the assailants three were killed on the spot, two, who were\r\ncaptured, committed suicide by ripping themselves up, and several of\r\nthose who escaped were wounded.\r\n\r\nA subsequent attack on the British legation resulted in the death of two\r\nEnglish sentries, one receiving nine and the other sixteen sword wounds.\r\nThe last of these murderous assaults was made on three English gentlemen\r\nand a lady, who were riding on the Tokaido, where they were met by the\r\ncortege of Shimadzoo Sabara, prince of Satzuma. Being ordered to return,\r\nthey complied, but no sooner had they turned their backs than they were\r\nset upon by the retainers of the prince, numbering between five and six\r\nhundred. The lady miraculously escaped, two of the gentlemen were\r\nwounded, and the third, Mr. Richardson, being nearly cut to pieces, fell\r\nfrom his horse, and when lying in a dying state, one of the high\r\nofficials of the cortege commanded a follower to cut the throat of the\r\nunfortunate gentleman, an order that was quickly obeyed.\r\n\r\nThese sanguinary deeds were diversified by various attempts at\r\narson--the latest, with aid of gunpowder, being successful. On the first\r\nof last February, the British minister's residence at Yedo was burned to\r\nthe ground by armed incendiaries, who made their work more sure by\r\nlaying trains of gunpowder, which caused a tremendous explosion; but as\r\nit was, the members of the legation were all at Yokuhama, and there was\r\nno loss of life except among the natives who tried to extinguish the\r\nfire--they were shot down by the incendiaries.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry naturally occurs, Are there no extenuating circumstances to\r\nbe adduced on the part of the Japanese? Were there no acts of\r\nprovocation on the part of foreigners? If we rely merely on the\r\ntestimony of the complainants, the reply would be an unqualified\r\nnegative. An impartial witness, however, finds no difficulty in\r\npresenting apologies, which have some claims to be considered as a\r\njustification of their conduct. The Japanese affirm that nearly every\r\ncase of assault was designed to avenge personal insult. The linguist and\r\nthe sentries of the British legation had perpetrated wrongs upon those\r\nby whom they subsequently fell. When the attack was made upon the\r\nsentries, it was by a solitary avenger, who stealthily crawled on his\r\nhands and knees until he reached and slew the offender; and he killed\r\nthe other because this last attempted to prevent his escape. In like\r\nmanner, the servants of the French official had committed outrages upon\r\nthese vindictive people, from whose resentment they suffered.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that if these men, instead of revenging\r\nthemselves, had sought legal redress, it could have been obtained, if at\r\nall, only at the hands of the masters of the aggressors, who would have\r\nbeen tried and punished, if convicted, according to the foreigners'\r\ncode. The Chinese sometimes resort to our tribunals, but oftener submit\r\nto wrong; the nobler Japanese have a sense of honor which will not\r\neasily brook such an invasion of their rights.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the case which the English make the immediate _casus\r\nbelli_--the murder of Richardson--there are contradictory statements; it\r\nis denied by the Japanese that he and his party turned back to make way\r\nfor the prince of Satzuma's cortege; they say, on the contrary, that he\r\nwas killed only after obstinate persistence in dashing through the\r\ncavalcade. Moreover, patriotism undoubtedly prompted many of the deeds\r\nof violence detailed in the foregoing record. Take for example the\r\nreason assigned by one of the assassins who was slain in one of the\r\nattacks on the British legation, as declared in a paper found on his\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n     'I, though I am a person of low standing, have no patience to stand\r\n     by and see the sacred empire defiled by the foreigner. If this\r\n     thing from time to time may cause the foreigner to retire, and\r\n     partly tranquillize the manes of departed mikados and tycoons, I\r\n     shall take to myself the highest praise. Regardless of my own life,\r\n     I am determined to set out.'\r\n\r\nThere were appended to the paper, from which the above extract is taken,\r\nthe names of fourteen _Lonins_, or bravos. These impulsive patriots did\r\nnot restrict their assaults to the aggressive foreigner, but assailed\r\nalso the nobles who acceded to the foreigners' demands. Several times\r\nministers of state were attacked in the streets, while surrounded by\r\ntheir retainers, and on each occasion many lives were lost in the fight\r\nwhich ensued. Indeed, continuing to follow English official authority,\r\nit would appear that the American treaties cost the lives of two\r\ntycoons, one regent, and several ministers and nobles, for the most part\r\nby self-evisceration. The assassination of the Gotairo, or regent, is\r\nfresh in the minds of the public. It took place at noon, while he was in\r\nthe midst of his guard, on his way to the palace. His head, we are\r\ninformed, was exposed at the execution ground at Miako, there being\r\nplaced over it the inscription: 'THIS IS THE HEAD OF A TRAITOR WHO HAS\r\nVIOLATED THE MOST SACRED LAWS OF JAPAN--THOSE WHICH FORBID THE ADMISSION\r\nOF FOREIGNERS INTO THE COUNTRY,'--but which the Japanese affirm was\r\nnever written. The sentence, however, seems to express the motives of\r\nthe murderers. It is the aristocracy of the empire that is fiercely\r\narrayed against an abandonment of the policy of isolation: that the\r\npopulace is not particularly hostile, is evinced by the comparative\r\nimmunity of foreigners from violence at the ports of Hakodadi and\r\nNagasaki.\r\n\r\nWhy should the ruling classes seek to abrogate the treaties and defy\r\nforeign powers? The Daimios are not ignorant of the prowess and\r\nresources of the country against which they particularly array\r\nthemselves: they are a well-informed and astute class, and cannot fall\r\nto see that feudalism and commerce are antagonistic--that free\r\nintercourse with foreigners is incompatible with the existence of the\r\npresent form of government: and therefore many of them would fain revert\r\nto the conservative policy of isolation. More than four years ago, the\r\nwriter of this article, then in Japan, although his opportunities of\r\nobservation were limited, published the opinion that a revolution would\r\nbe the inevitable result of the concessions that had been extorted from\r\nthe tycoon; that civil war could hardly fail to take place, by which the\r\ngovernment would be brought under the sway of one ruler, tycoon, mikado,\r\nor some powerful daimio, which would lead to the destruction of the\r\nfeudal system, and to the introduction of Christian civilization, a\r\nconsummation which we in the interest of the Japanese may devoutly wish,\r\nbut which the daimios, having full knowledge of the same, must in\r\nself-defence resist to the last. Hence the English base their charge\r\nthat the attacks on foreigners were instigated by the nobles, and\r\nperpetrated by their retainers, which remains to be proved.\r\n\r\nApart from the prospective evils consequent on an abandonment of the\r\nrestrictive policy under which the empire has long prospered, there were\r\nimmediate consequences which to a high-minded people must be galling and\r\ndegrading beyond endurance. The treaties have robbed them of their\r\nindependence: compelling them to abdicate sovereignty to the extent of\r\nabsolving resident foreigners from Japanese jurisdiction. In various\r\npublications in the East and in Europe the writer has attempted to show\r\nhow disastrous extra-territoriality has been to China; on the present\r\noccasion it will suffice to name this violation of a nation's rights as\r\njustifying resistance to the last on the part of patriots in Japan.\r\n\r\nWhile for good political reasons some daimios have endeavored to render\r\nthe treaties inoperative, and to frighten foreigners out of the land,\r\nthere has been springing up among the people a strong antipathy toward\r\nthem, for which they have themselves alone to blame. Who that read the\r\nglowing accounts of the reception at first accorded to our people, did\r\nnot admire the suavity and hospitality of the Japanese? This friendly\r\nintercourse lasted only until the parties came to understand each other.\r\nNow, we are told that when a western man passes through the streets he\r\nis hooted at as 'Tojin baka,' a foreign fool, a gentler way of putting\r\nit than in China--where it is 'Fanqui'--foreign devil. The practical\r\njoking in which many foreigners are apt to indulge is often carried too\r\nfar, and being accompanied by an arrogant demeanor of superiority,\r\nproves highly offensive. Again, we find the _Tojin baka_ often fail to\r\ndiscriminate between different classes of females. Discovering that the\r\nJapanese were lewd beyond all other people, with institutions fostering\r\nvice, without even the flimsy pretext of hygienic considerations, they\r\ntake liberties which rouse the vindictive rage of husbands.\r\n\r\nPalliation may be found for the alleged arson mentioned in the catalogue\r\nof complaints that have excited British indignation. In the question of\r\na site for the residence of the ambassadors, the irrepressible foreigner\r\ndemanded a celebrated temple, and its magnificent grounds, the Hyde Park\r\nof Yedo--a favorite place of resort of the citizens on holiday\r\nmerrymaking. Recent accounts represent this cession of a popular place\r\nof recreation as having cost the tycoon much of his popularity, and as\r\ninvolving him in a controversy with the spiritual emperor, who, as\r\nPontifex maximus, has exclusive authority over religious edifices.\r\nYielding to pressure from above and below, the tycoon begged the\r\nambassadors to consent to the removal of the buildings to some other\r\nsite in the metropolis less obnoxious to the mikado and to the populace,\r\nall the expense of which the Japanese Government offered to pay. Only\r\none of the buildings had been completed, that for the British legation.\r\nColonel Neal, H. B. M. _chargé d'affaires_, was solicited to give his\r\nconsent, which he refused. Time was precious. The mikado's envoy was\r\nabout to return with a final answer; it was necessary that something\r\nshould be done to save the tycoon from the consequences of his\r\ndisobedience. The knot was cut, as we have seen, by the torch and by\r\ngunpowder.\r\n\r\nIn the use of firearms the prejudices of the natives have been\r\nneedlessly offended. Shooting game is not generally allowed to the\r\npeople, yet foreigners here often been reckless in the pursuit of sport,\r\nregardless where they sought it, and terrifying the people. Again,\r\nriding on horseback is allowed only to the nobles, and it is a source of\r\nprovocation to all classes to witness the equestrian performances of\r\nforeigners of every station in life, whose amusement at times consists\r\nin making pedestrians scatter as they gallop through crowded streets.\r\nMoreover, the Chinese servants in the employ of foreigners habitually\r\ninsult and oppress the natives, presuming on immunity as retainers of\r\nthe privileged stranger. As the Japanese hold the Celestials in supreme\r\ncontempt, and as that feeling is fully reciprocated, collisions are the\r\nconsequence, and it is pretty certain that the 'servants' of the\r\nlegation who were murdered were offending Chinamen.\r\n\r\nGuizot remarks, in his 'History of Civilization,' 'of all systems of\r\ngovernment, it may be asserted, without fear of contradiction, that the\r\nmost difficult to establish and render effectual, is the federative\r\nsystem--which eminently requires the greatest maturity of reason, of\r\nmorality, and of civilization, in which it is applied. The very nature\r\nitself of feudalism is opposed to order and legality.' It was with the\r\nexecutive of a feudal federative system that European and American\r\ngovernments negotiated these treaties, a duplicate sovereign over six\r\nhundred and twenty feudal barons, commanding above two hundred thousand\r\narmed retainers, governing a people wanting in reason and morality. The\r\nexistence of the theocratic element served further to complicate the\r\nmachinery of government at Yedo. It may be questioned whether the\r\nministers of the tycoon were ever heartily in favor of an abandonment of\r\nthe policy of exclusivism. It is probable that they yielded to the\r\ndemands made upon them, as the least of two evils, a refusal promising\r\nto involve them in wars, which might eventually lead to their\r\nsubjugation to one of the least scrupulous of the aggressive powers. In\r\nthe inauguration of the system, Japanese statesmanship was exposed to a\r\nsevere ordeal. On one hand was the task of pacifying the native\r\nopponents of the fundamental change in polity, and on the other, the\r\nduty of evading, as far as possible, the concessions that had been wrung\r\nfrom them by the foreigner. Something answering to demagoguism is found\r\nin the Ultra Orient: there was not only the honest opposition of the\r\npatriot, but the factious hostility of the office seeker, against whom\r\nthe ministry were called to contend. As a consequence, those who were\r\nresponsible for the innovation soon lost their lives or their posts.\r\nTheir successors found themselves, as is often the case in political\r\nchanges, obliged, when in power, to carry out the general policy which,\r\nwhen in opposition, they decried. Instead of abrogating the treaties,\r\nthey aimed, by evasions and restrictions, to render nugatory many of\r\ntheir stipulations. The _Japanese Herald_, an English mercantile\r\nnewspaper, published in Yokuhama, gives the following list of\r\nconcessions made to the Japanese Government:\r\n\r\n     'The right to trade in gold was given up; the right to exchange\r\n     money, weight for weight, was given up; enforcing recovery of debts\r\n     clause was given up; Ne-egata was given up; Yedo followed;\r\n     non-circulation of dollars in the country unopposed; Kanagawa as a\r\n     residence given up; land leases at the usual rate of the country\r\n     given up; restrictions on employment of servants allowed without\r\n     remonstrance; immunity from local jurisdiction endangered; and,\r\n     lastly, Osaka given up on our own minister's representation.'\r\n\r\nStill, the gioro, or council of state, failed to appease the factious\r\nopposition, and are charged by Sir Rutherford with not being really\r\ndesirous of securing foreigners from injurious treatment even from the\r\nhands of their own officials. A candid observer, on reviewing all the\r\ncircumstances of the case, will absolve the Government of the tycoon\r\nfrom the charge of complicity in the injurious treatment from which\r\nforeigners have suffered. It must be admitted that the Government were,\r\nas they protested, helpless in the matter. In almost every instance they\r\nfailed to discover and punish the murderous assailants, who were\r\nscreened by disaffected powerful daimios. They encountered obstacles,\r\nthe same in character, but far greater in degree, in repressing the\r\nhostility toward foreigners which our authorities had in restraining\r\naggression against natives; and further, it ought not to be forgotten\r\nthat they acceded promptly to all the demands made upon them for\r\npecuniary compensation as an atonement for lives taken and for wounds\r\ninflicted. Ten thousand dollars was sent through Mr. Harris to\r\nPhiladelphia, for the widowed mother of the murdered Heuskin, and such\r\nwas their regret for the occurrence that the Government would have paid\r\nmanifold more, if our minister had seen fit to exact as much. English\r\nsufferers, or their relations, also received liberal compensation.\r\n\r\nMenaced by the feudal aristocracy, and by the theocratic element of the\r\nGovernment, the tycoon's ministers could not but look forward to the\r\nperiod when, by treaty stipulations, the concessions which had been so\r\nfatal to their predecessors, and against which they had themselves\r\ninveighed, were to be extended to new ports. If the admission of\r\nforeigners into or near the metropolis or seat of the temporal authority\r\nhad proved disastrous, what evils might not be expected when, by\r\nadmitting them to Hiogo, or Osaca, they would be brought so near to the\r\ncapital or seat of the spiritual power!\r\n\r\nTo avert, or rather to postpone this impending evil, an embassy was\r\ndespatched to European countries with which treaties had been made,\r\nsoliciting an extension of time (five years) for the opening of new\r\nports. Mr. Harris easily obtained the assent of our Government to the\r\nreasonable request. Earl Russell acceded also, but required as an\r\nequivalent the strict execution of all the other points of the treaty;\r\nviz., the abolition of all restrictions, whether as regards quantity or\r\nprice, on the sale by Japanese to foreigners of all kinds of\r\nmerchandise; all restrictions on labor, and more particularly on the\r\nhire of carpenters, boatmen, boats and coolies, teachers, and servants,\r\nof whatever denomination; all restrictions whereby daimios are prevented\r\nfrom sending their produce to market, and from selling the same directly\r\nto their own agents; all restrictions resulting from attempts on the\r\npart of the customhouse authorities and other officials to obtain fees;\r\nall restrictions limiting the classes of persons who shall be allowed to\r\ntrade with foreigners; and all restrictions imposed on free intercourse\r\nof a social kind between foreigners and the people of Japan. These all\r\nseem reasonable, and are only what the Japanese Government was already\r\nbound by treaty to fulfil; but as our Federal Government has found\r\nitself embarrassed by South Carolina's treatment of colored British\r\nsubjects, so the tycoon's ministers find some of the feudal daimios\r\nnullifying or disregarding the treaty obligations of the general\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIf, however, a more conciliatory policy on the part of British residents\r\nhad been pursued toward the Japanese people, if greater allowance had\r\nbeen made by English officials for the peculiar difficulties surrounding\r\nthe Government to which they were accredited, and if more confidence had\r\nbeen placed in the good faith of the tycoon's ministers, it is certain\r\nthat all opposition would have been gradually overcome. At one time a\r\nmajority of the daimios had become reconciled to foreign intercourse;\r\nbut the anti-foreign party has been increased and incensed by recent\r\nevents; and there is danger that a compliance with the new demands of\r\nthe foreigner will involve the country in civil war.\r\n\r\nThe treatment which the luckless envoys experienced on their return from\r\nEurope after a successful mission, shows how imperfectly the demands of\r\nthe British minister will be complied with: we find official accounts\r\nfrom the Swiss embassy published in the _Dagblad_ of the Hague, that\r\nthey were degraded from rank and dismissed from office; the secretary\r\nand linguist having been a pupil and friend of the writer, he perused\r\ntheir political obituary with much regret. However, office holding in\r\nthe far East is not only an equivocal honor, but a precarious means of\r\nsubsistence, which, as the aspirants fully understand, one can somewhat\r\neconomize his commiseration. Why, they are used to it in that strange\r\ncountry. The last mail brings intelligence of the degradation of one\r\nhundred and ten office holders of all grades, from the proud minister of\r\nstate down to the humble clerk. In this list of casualties, too, a\r\nfriend and pupil turns up. Dr. Itowo Gambono was a fussy fellow,\r\nsomething of a politician and courtier, and never mindful of\r\nprofessional etiquette when it stood in the way of his advancement. His\r\nImperial Majesty the Tycoon, a dissolute youth of nineteen, with three\r\nwives, is subject, of course, to various maladies. The court physician\r\nadministered a prescription so nauseous that the royal patient kicked\r\nagainst the whole materia medica; and great was the consternation of the\r\ncourt, when Dr. Itowo Gambono, who had been engineering for the office\r\nof surgeon royal, allayed apprehension by making known his\r\nqualifications, and the palatable character of his prescriptions. He was\r\ninstalled in office; but trusting exclusively to the _vis medicatrix\r\nnaturæ_, and having been discovered in administering nothing but\r\nsweetened water, he suffered in the general proscription. A medical jury\r\nmight render the verdict: Served him right for intriguing against his\r\n_confrere_.\r\n\r\nThe curious reader will be gratified with learning what some of the\r\nJapanese themselves have to say on the question of the relations betwixt\r\nthe foreigner and their own Government, and it is not likely that the\r\nsubjoined translation of a document, purporting to be a protest\r\naddressed to the tycoon's ministers, but intended as a complaint against\r\nthem to the mikado or spiritual emperor, will be found too long for\r\nperusal:\r\n\r\n     'When you consulted us about the new relations into which we were\r\n     to enter with foreigners, you told us, upon the authority of a\r\n     certain Harisoo (Mr. Harris) the American, that the treaty would\r\n     give us plenty and abundance. Both you and Harisoo said that cotton\r\n     would be sold for a mere nothing, and that silk and manufactured\r\n     goods would not cost us anything. The daily necessaries of life\r\n     would be brought to our country from all quarters of the globe, and\r\n     our farmers would not be required to sow and reap. We anxiously\r\n     expect these miracles, and at present we enjoy advantages which you\r\n     never mentioned, namely, that those articles which you and Harisoo\r\n     promised to give us at very low prices are now three times as\r\n     expensive as they formerly were. You told us that our treasuries\r\n     would be always open to receive the enormous riches which our\r\n     intercourse with foreigners would always give us. It is an\r\n     undeniable fact that our treasuries have been always open, but,\r\n     instead of receiving money, we have been called upon to sacrifice\r\n     the little we possess. You monopolize the import and export duties\r\n     completely, and we had a right to suppose that those duties which,\r\n     according to your statement and those of your financier Harisoo,\r\n     would enrich the Japanese nation, ought to cover expenses such as\r\n     building fortifications and buying men-of-war, which you say must\r\n     inspire the barbarians with the respect due to our country. But\r\n     what have you done for the last three years? What has been the\r\n     tenor of all your despatches? Japan must be fortified,\r\n     fortifications must be built, the artillery and navy increased.\r\n     Money is required. If we could only see those fortifications,\r\n     those men-of-war, we would complain less about expenses; but\r\n     everything is proposed and nothing executed. You think that\r\n     drawings and plans will scare foreigners, and cause them to flee\r\n     from our country; but we doubt it, for they really equal us in this\r\n     art. You sometimes talk to us about political economy; we candidly\r\n     own you give us excellent advice; unfortunately we have numerous\r\n     proofs that you do not follow the precepts that you give us. Why\r\n     was such an incredible sum of money spent for all the vain and\r\n     useless pomp which accompanied the sister of the mikado on her\r\n     journey to Yedo, preparatory to her marriage with the tycoon? Why\r\n     was so much money wasted in rebuilding the palace of the tycoon? We\r\n     shall not mention the various ways in which the public money is\r\n     wasted, as this would cause the nation to blush, and the mikado to\r\n     mourn. As you always remind us of the great principles of political\r\n     economy when you demand pecuniary supplies, pardon us for making\r\n     the following remarks. Owing to the troubled state of the country,\r\n     the presence of the daimios at Yedo was formerly very necessary.\r\n     Now, this is not the case at present, and still our lords are\r\n     always travelling to and from the capital. The personal fatigue,\r\n     the vexation, the expense of the immense retinue which always\r\n     accompanies them, can no longer be supported.\r\n\r\n     'The time has come that these ruinous journeys should cease, and\r\n     the lords of Japan declare themselves unable to defray the expense\r\n     which you impose upon them. As foreign trade has nearly ruined us,\r\n     and as fortifications and numerous other unforeseen expenses are\r\n     deemed necessary in all the parts which have been opened to\r\n     barbarians, we not only demand that the new ports Osaka, Neëgata,\r\n     and Yedo shall not be opened, but that Kanagawa be closed. You\r\n     always assert that we are opposed to friendly intercourse with\r\n     foreign nations, but this is utterly false; we willingly consent to\r\n     open the whole of Japan, if this step does not occasion expenses\r\n     which are beyond our means. We have not murdered our servants who\r\n     were favorably inclined toward the opening of Japan to foreigners.\r\n     We never spread insulting libels against foreigners amongst our\r\n     people. _We_ never called Harisoo a fool, Aroako (Sir R. Alcock)\r\n     a ----, and Borrookoroo (M. de Bellecourt, French consul general)\r\n     a ----. _We_ never called the consuls drunkards and foreign\r\n     merchants thieves. _You_ teach the young to despise and insult\r\n     foreigners, and although you always tell us that the foreign\r\n     nations are powerful and greatly to be feared, a high functionary\r\n     lately said, 'With the exception of one of the nations, all the\r\n     foreigners could be insulted with impunity.''\r\n\r\nAlthough this document, evidently a clumsy forgery, bears traces of\r\nhaving been composed apparently by a native penny-a-liner for the\r\nforeign newspaper, yet it apparently expresses the opinion of a large\r\nclass of rulers and people, and serves to exhibit some of the features\r\nof the varied opposition which the tycoon has to encounter.\r\n\r\nThe perils which menace the tycoon, or rather the council of state, are\r\nmultiform. In the Prince of Mito, they have an aspirant to the\r\ntycoonship, by whose machinations it is believed foreigners have\r\nsuffered, merely that the Government might be embarrassed. Rulers like\r\nthe Prince of Kago, preferring death to compliance with the foreigners'\r\ndemands; recent events admonishing the council and ministers that this\r\npenalty is likely to attend their yielding; at the same time importunity\r\nis used at the court of Miako--the spiritual emperor--to curtail or\r\nabolish the authority at Yedo; while the barbarian stands, torch in\r\nhand, ready not only to fire another palace, but with formidable fleets\r\nprepared to bombard cities!\r\n\r\nOne of the most resolute and powerful of the daimios who hold that it\r\nwere better to die fighting rather than yield the points in dispute, is\r\nShimadzu Sabara, Prince of Satzuma. It was his retainers who killed\r\nRichardson, and he will not suffer them to be delivered up for\r\npunishment, from the conviction doubtless that they committed the deed\r\nwhile resisting the advance of an arrogant foreigner. He seems to have\r\nthe ability and the will to resist any attempt on the part of the\r\ngeneral government to coerce him, hence the embarrassment which is\r\noccasioned by the British demand for the punishment of the assassins. He\r\nhas particularly allied himself to the spiritual emperor, in whose\r\ncapital he is popular; we read of him a short time since making a\r\ndonation to the poor of Miako of ten thousand piculs of rice. Strictly\r\nspeaking, Shimadzu Sabara is regent of Satzuma, the prince, who is his\r\nnephew, being only six years of age. Satzuma, the principality, is on\r\nthe southerly extremity of the most southerly island of the Archipelago\r\nKiusiu. Its capital, Kagosima, is a rich port, having 500,000\r\ninhabitants; the Loo Choo Islands acknowledge the Prince of Satzuma as\r\nsuzerain. Much of the prosperity of that part of Japan is due to the\r\nsagacity and enterprise of the late prince. He applied himself to the\r\nstudy of natural science, particularly the practical part, and\r\nestablished manufactories on a large scale, introducing all foreign arts\r\nthat could be acquired. His glass manufactures have attained to a good\r\ndegree of perfection, and the foundery for smelting and forging iron ore\r\nis on an extensive scale, employing about two thousand men. Some bronze\r\nguns made there were of a caliber for balls of 150 pounds weight. He\r\nconstructed also several spacious docks. This prince paid the writer of\r\nthis article the compliment of republishing his 'Treatise on the Law of\r\nStorms,' published several years ago in the Chinese language. He died in\r\n1859, much lamented by his subjects.\r\n\r\nNot less enterprising is the Prince of Fizen, in whose principality the\r\nwell-known port of Nagasaki is situated. The foundery, with its steam\r\nhammer and other appliances, for his navy, consisting of several\r\nsteamers purchased from foreigners, is a striking object in that\r\nbeautiful harbor. He is in favor of intercourse with foreigners; we read\r\nof his assembling his vassals like a baron of olden time, and taking\r\ntheir opinions, and that of his officers, on the question of admitting\r\nforeigners, and informing his suzerain of their acquiescence. Stimulated\r\nby the example of these two princes, other nobles are desirous of\r\nacquiring power by adopting improvements from abroad. It has been stated\r\nthat applications have been made for sixty steamers. A Dutch mercantile\r\npaper lately published a list of twenty steamers in course of\r\nconstruction for the Japanese. As American steamers have been found best\r\nadapted for the Chinese waters, we ought to construct more for our\r\nJapanese neighbors than we have yet done.\r\n\r\nThe British Government demands an indemnity for the families of the\r\nslain--£5,000 for each sentry, and £10,000 for Mr. Richardson, and the\r\npunishment of the murderers. As the validity of the treaties has been\r\nquestioned, Japanese having recently in several instances taken the\r\nposition that the tycoon had no authority to make them, it has been\r\nproposed that Miako should be visited and the mikado compelled to ratify\r\nit; and as the Prince of Satzuma is responsible for the latest murder,\r\nit has been proposed that Kagosima should be bombarded, and that his\r\nfief, the Loo Choo Islands, should be held as a material guarantee for\r\nthe fulfilment of his (the tycoon's) and the mikados' obligations. Some\r\nBritish journalists have maintained that as the expense of a war, from\r\nthe courage of the people and the appliances of the rulers, would be\r\ngreat, as the trade is of small value, and as the Japanese have right on\r\ntheir side in resisting the encroachments of foreigners, it is\r\nadvisable, after obtaining due reparation, to withdraw from the country\r\naltogether:--a proposition little in accordance with Britain's\r\nantecedents; such a relinquishment of purpose would occasion a loss of\r\nprestige which would jeopardize her sway from Hong Kong to Bombay. The\r\nresponse made to the proposition to retire from the country is that it\r\nwould not only be ignominious, but perilous to their interests in the\r\nfar East, which are now in jeopardy from the 'encroachments of Russia,\r\nthe diplomacy, not always honest and aboveboard, of America, and the\r\nambitious policy of France.'\r\n\r\nAn ulterior object with that power is to obtain a foothold in the North\r\nPacific, which shall connect Hong Kong with British Columbia, and events\r\nwill be shaped as far as possible to secure that end. With France\r\nstrongly fortified at Annam, and Russian power growing on the Amoor, the\r\nEnglish are apprehensive that in a war with either of those countries\r\ntheir cargoes of silk, tea, and opium would be somewhat insecure. While\r\nEngland has the merit of extending free trade to her new acquisitions,\r\nshe makes them, even in peace, a means of annoyance to American\r\ncommerce; consequently, we cannot regard with indifference her\r\nterritorial expansion in the North Pacific. When we come to devote the\r\nattention to our interests in that part of the world which they merit,\r\nour friends on the Pacific coast will discover that European Governments\r\nare in possession of all the commanding points, if, indeed, they do not\r\nfind China and Japan under an Anglo-French protectorate--an end for\r\nwhich many are devoting their energies. In view of the fact that it is\r\nthrough our agency that this country has been opened, and thus exposed\r\nto its present dangers, and considering that the Japanese Government is\r\nnearly, if not wholly, blameless, as regards its foreign relations,\r\nAmericans cannot but hope that in the approaching conflict, Japan will\r\nsuffer neither loss of territory, power, or character.\r\n\r\nAn article, in the American treaty says:\r\n\r\n     'The President of the United States, at the request of the Japanese\r\n     Government, will act as a friendly mediator in such matters of\r\n     difference as arise between the Government of Japan and the\r\n     European powers.'\r\n\r\nAccordingly, application has been made to Mr. Pruyn, soliciting through\r\nhim an extension of time in replying to Colonel Neal's ultimatum, which\r\nhas been accorded, but as a sharp correspondence is said to have arisen\r\nbetween the English and American ambassadors in relation to the sale of\r\narms by our merchants to the Japanese, Mr. Pruyn's mediation is not\r\nlikely to avail much in the approaching strife. As Japan is a friendly\r\npower, to which we are allied by treaty, we feel curious to hear what\r\narguments have been adduced by the English to show that we ought not to\r\ndeal in material of war with that country.\r\n\r\nThe position of Americans in Japan, as regards diplomacy, commerce, and\r\nChristian missions, with other matters of general interest, omitted for\r\nwant of space, will form subjects of another article in the series which\r\nis proposed for publication in THE CONTINENTAL on Eastern Asiatic\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS HE SUCCESSFUL?\r\n\r\n     'Do but grasp into the thick of human life! Every one _lives_\r\n     it--to not many is it _known_; and seize it where you will, it is\r\n     interesting.'--GOETHE.\r\n\r\n     'SUCCESSFUL.--Terminating in accomplishing what is wished or\r\n     intended.'--WEBSTER'S _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nWhat should she say to her?\r\n\r\nShe had decided in the brief period of reflection before entering the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nAmputation, sudden and quick--then treatment, as a surgeon would express\r\nit.\r\n\r\n'Emma, it is all over with us. Mr. Meeker has been here and has broken\r\noff his engagement with you. The reason is, because your father has lost\r\nhis property. I shall never regret our misfortunes, since it has saved\r\nyou from becoming the wife of a selfish, heartless wretch.'\r\n\r\nEmma did not faint, or scream, or burst into tears; but she turned very\r\npale indeed, and sat without speaking, as if expecting her mother to say\r\nsomething more.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tenant looked at her anxiously. She would have much preferred a\r\ndemonstration of some sort to silence--silence and pallor. She\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n'Emma, you are our only child, our all. We think of your happiness more\r\nthan of anything else in this world. Your mother is with you now; she\r\nwill help you and sustain you until you have recovered, as you soon\r\nwill, from the effect of this sudden shock.'\r\n\r\n'And he said it was because papa had failed?' inquired Emma, without\r\nappearing to notice what her mother was saying.\r\n\r\n'Exactly.'\r\n\r\n'Then it was because he thought I was rich that he wanted to marry me?'\r\n\r\n'For nothing else in the world,' replied Mrs. Tenant, impatiently.\r\n\r\nEmma was again silent, but she was no longer pale; on the contrary, the\r\ncolor was fast filling her cheeks, and she blushed as she said, in a low\r\ntone, 'I shall feel so mortified to go into church.'\r\n\r\nMrs. Tenant was delighted. A great point was gained. Emma was already\r\nbrought back to ordinary considerations; her pride would rally now.\r\n\r\n'Never mind, my darling, never mind; for once it may be a little\r\nawkward, but, after all, what do we care?'\r\n\r\nVery commonplace, to be sure, but it was all she could say.\r\n\r\n'Everybody knows that the wedding day was fixed. Then, you know, I had\r\nto explain why it was put off to Ellen Stanley and Julia Petit, for they\r\nwere to be my bridesmaids. This morning I met Ellen, and she asked me\r\nwhen it was to be, and I told her Hi--Mr. Meeker had not yet returned.\r\nShe declared she saw him on the corner of Bond street and Broadway day\r\nbefore yesterday morning. She said she could not be mistaken. I told her\r\nshe _was_ mistaken. Now I dare say she _did_ see him. What _shall_ I do?\r\nEverybody will have the story, and how they will laugh at me!'\r\n\r\n'We will see about that, we will see,' said Mrs. Tenant.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, she did not know exactly what to reply.\r\n\r\n'I shall be ashamed to show myself in the street.'\r\n\r\n'Nonsense, my darling.'\r\n\r\nKissing her daughter cheerfully, Mrs. Tenant went down stairs to meet\r\nher husband, whom she heard at the door.\r\n\r\nThe moment her mother left, Emma's heart sank, and she began to cry.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tenant was not long in putting her husband in possession of the\r\nsituation of things. He was astonished, of course. He asked a great\r\nmany questions, and at last seemed to comprehend how matters stood. He\r\nappeared to be very deeply affected, though he said but little. He did\r\nnot speak on the subject to Emma, but soon after dinner took his hat and\r\nwalked out.\r\n\r\nIn a short time he was standing on the steps of Dr. Chellis's house, and\r\nhad rung the bell. He was presently seated in the Doctor's 'study' (he\r\ndeclined to go into the drawing room), waiting for him to come in.\r\n\r\nNow it so happened that Dr. Chellis and Mr. Tenant were schoolmates at\r\nExeter Academy, and afterward classmates at Yale. More than this, for\r\ntwo years they roomed together. Young Tenant did not have much taste for\r\nstudy, but his father, a man of competence, desired his son to be\r\n'educated,' even if it should afterward be decided to make a merchant of\r\nhim. It was perhaps because the young men were so unlike that they took\r\nto each other from the first and became intimate. There was something in\r\nTenant's honest, genuine, and amiable nature, which was exceedingly\r\nattractive to the hardy, earnest, uncompromising Chellis. Their intimacy\r\nwas a matter of surprise and marvel to all, yet I think is easily\r\naccounted for on the hypothesis just mentioned. That Tenant maintained a\r\nrespectable standing in his class he owed to Chellis, for it was their\r\nhabit to go over their lessons together after Chellis had 'dug out' his,\r\nand thus fortified, Tenant's recitations were very fair.\r\n\r\nThe young men never lost sight of each other. With them it continued\r\nalways to be 'Aleck' and 'Harry.' Whenever the young clergyman came to\r\nNew York he was received at the house of the young merchant with open\r\narms. After some years, opportunity was presented for 'Harry,' to wit,\r\nMr. Henry Tenant, of the leading house of Allwise, Tenant & Co., to use\r\nhis influence in his church, where the pulpit had become vacant, to have\r\n'Aleck,' to wit, the Rev. Alexander Chellis, called to fill it. The\r\nlatter received the invitation with pleasure, for it opened a field to\r\nhim he longed to enter. There was one drawback. He had not sufficient\r\nmeans to properly furnish a city house, where matters are on a scale so\r\nmuch more expensive than in the country. But he came down to consult his\r\nfriend. After a full discussion they retired, the clergyman still not\r\npersuaded he could accept, and really most unwilling to decline. The\r\nnext morning the merchant was up very early, and bolting into his\r\nfriend's room, he woke him from a sound slumber, exclaiming, 'Aleck, I\r\nhave got to be absent to-day--shall not be in till evening; but I have\r\nthought your affair all over, and decided that you must come, and that\r\nforthwith. As to the little objection which troubles you, here is what\r\nwill obviate it; and mind you, Aleck, if you ever allude to this\r\ncircumstance, either to me or to any living being, I swear, by Jupiter\r\nAmmon, your favorite old heathen, that I will never again recognize you\r\nas friend.'\r\n\r\nThus delivering himself, he thrust a check for a thousand dollars into\r\nthe hands of the astonished clergyman, who lay listening to his\r\nharangue, fully convinced his friend was actually out of his wits. The\r\nnext instant the door was closed; and rubbing his eyes to satisfy\r\nhimself he was not dreaming, he examined the piece of paper in his hand,\r\nand read it forward and backward, upside down, and right side up, until\r\nhe actually began to comprehend what it meant. More than this, he fully\r\nappreciated the act, and accepted it; and further, he never did allude\r\nto the circumstance, not even so much as to thank his friend. It is\r\ntrue, when the latter came back that evening and the two shook hands,\r\nthat Harry felt a peculiar pressure, and observed a peculiar expression\r\nin Aleck's eyes, which he fancied for the moment were moist.\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Chellis was ordained over the church in New York. Years ran\r\naway. He became a famous divine, justly celebrated through town and\r\ncountry. We know the position Mr. Tenant enjoyed. The two always\r\nmaintained their old intimacy. When alone together, it was still 'Aleck'\r\nand 'Harry.' College jokes were repeated, college days lived over, and,\r\nwhile together, it would seem that neither was a day the older for the\r\nyears that had rolled over them. It is not to be wondered at then that\r\non receiving the unlooked-for intelligence of Hiram Meeker's conduct he\r\nshould desire to consult his old friend and lay the case before him.\r\n\r\nApologizing for keeping the reader so long on the threshold of Dr.\r\nChellis's study, we will now enter with him, and report the conference.\r\n\r\n'Aleck, I am in trouble.' That was the first remark after the greeting.\r\n\r\nNever before had Mr. Tenant made such an observation to his friend. The\r\nold merchant had borne his failure like a man, accepting it as a part of\r\nthe 'fortune of war.' He neither whimpered nor made wry faces. So, when\r\nDr. Chellis heard the words, 'Aleck, I am in trouble,' he knew they\r\nmeant a great deal. He took his seat, not in his accustomed place, but\r\non the sofa close to his friend, and turning on him an anxious,\r\nsympathizing look, he said, in a tone gentler than a woman's, 'What is\r\nit, Harry?'\r\n\r\n'Harry' told him the whole. The burden of all his thoughts was his\r\ndaughter, and his lip quivered when he spoke of her love for the man who\r\nhad proved to be so base, and of the effect the disappointment might\r\nhave on her.\r\n\r\nWhen he had concluded, Dr. Chellis started to his feet and began to pace\r\nup and down the room with great energy, exclaiming, 'God be praised! God\r\nbe praised! God be praised!'\r\n\r\n'For what, Aleck, for what?' inquired Mr. Tenant, rising anxiously from\r\nhis seat and attempting to place himself before his friend, and thus\r\nintercept a response; 'do tell me for what?'\r\n\r\nThis time they met in the middle of the room; the Doctor no longer\r\navoided his companion, but responded, with emphasis, 'For the escape! I\r\ntell you, Harry, it should be the happiest day of your life! yes, the\r\nhappiest day of your life! Do you hear me?'\r\n\r\nFor Mr. Tenant did not appear to comprehend what the other was saying.\r\n\r\n'I tell you,' continued the Doctor, 'Emma's engagement has been a\r\nperpetual source of sorrow to me. Yet I had nothing definite to urge\r\nagainst it, nothing, in fact, but what might be called a prejudice,\r\nwhich it would have been unjust to speak of--and--but--the fact is, I\r\nknew,' burst forth the now fairly enraged Doctor, interrupting himself\r\nand marching off again at double quick, 'I knew the fellow was a scamp,\r\never since he came whimpering to me about his conviction and God's\r\nprovidence, wonderful conversion, and so on. Conversion! I'll convert\r\nhim!'\r\n\r\nThe Doctor's right hand opened and shut as if enclosing in its grasp the\r\ncollar of Hiram's coat.\r\n\r\nMr. Tenant meantime kept standing in the middle of the room, trying in\r\nvain to bring the Doctor again to a halt. Whether he would have\r\nsucceeded will not be known, for a knock at the door served to effect\r\nthe purpose, while his sharp, angry 'Come in' so terrified the servant\r\ngirl that she opened it barely wide enough to enable her to announce, in\r\na faint tone, Mr. Meeker.'\r\n\r\n'Ask him into the parlor,' said the Doctor, in his natural voice, 'I\r\nwill see him presently.'\r\n\r\nThen he turned, and in his usual manner bade his friend sit. Both\r\nresumed their places on the sofa, and the Doctor proceeded:\r\n\r\n'Harry, it is all settled. The whole thing is clear. It comes just in\r\nthe right time. You know Maria is to sail for Europe next week. You know\r\nhow fond she is of Emma. It was but yesterday she was saying how\r\npleasant it would be if Emma could go with her. Then she supposed it\r\nimpossible. Now it is all right. The young people are to be absent six\r\nor eight months. This will put Emma quite right. Now, then, we have\r\ndecided this, you must let me have my session with that knave yonder.'\r\n\r\n'But Aleck! Aleck!' exclaimed Mr. Tenant, making an effort to stop his\r\nfriend, who was about to leave the room, 'you forget--you forget my\r\naltered circumstances. Much as I like the plan, the thing is\r\nimpossible--really quite impossible.'\r\n\r\nThe Doctor turned on his companion impatiently.\r\n\r\n'That's my affair,' he said. 'Mind that Emma is ready.'\r\n\r\n'No, no, Aleck--no, no, that must not be. No, no.'\r\n\r\nThe Doctor looked as if about to make an assault on his friend, and then\r\nraising his finger in a menacing manner, 'Who was it,' he exclaimed\r\nfiercely, 'that with rude force burst into my room one morning,\r\ndisturbing my slumbers, and committing various acts of violence, while I\r\nwas in a defenceless state unable to resist--who was it?'\r\n\r\nThe Doctor's eyes actually glared with such a genuine expression of\r\nrage, that Mr. Tenant lost his self-possession, and, as if afraid to\r\nadmit the charge, answered faintly:\r\n\r\n'I don't know.'\r\n\r\n'You lie, you dog--you know you do,' said the Doctor, relaxing his angry\r\ntone. 'Ah, Harry, I did not think it of you.'\r\n\r\nThis last remark was uttered in the old familiar, gentle tone, and was\r\naccompanied by a look--just such a look as he had given him on the\r\nevening of the memorable affair of the thousand-dollar check.\r\n\r\nTears came into Mr. Tenant's eyes.\r\n\r\n'Come, come,' said the Doctor, 'don't be foolish; away with you, and let\r\nme attend to my business.'\r\n\r\nThey shook hands silently, and the Doctor, closing the door after his\r\nfriend, went back to his study, rang the bell, and directed Hiram to be\r\nsummoned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs. Tenant received the account which her husband brought her of his\r\nvisit to Dr. Chellis, and what had been decided on, with the liveliest\r\nsatisfaction. She went at once to her daughter's apartment (she had\r\nthought best to leave her to herself for the evening), and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'Emma, my child, what do you think your papa has done? He has arranged\r\nfor you to go with the Chaunceys to Europe next week. You know Maria was\r\ntelling you Monday that if you were not going to be married, she should\r\ninsist on your accompanying her. Now tell me, Emma, are you not\r\ndelighted?'\r\n\r\nEmma _was_ delighted, or rather she was greatly relieved. She had more\r\nsensitiveness and more pride than one would suppose, judging from her\r\namiable disposition. Her position had always been so well assured, her\r\nsociety so much sought for, and she so much courted, that never, until\r\nthis occasion, had she experienced any important trial of her temper or\r\nemotions.\r\n\r\nTo appear in society, the daughter of a bankrupt, jilted, and jilted\r\nbecause she was no longer an heiress, exposed to the various remarks and\r\nbusy gossip so rife on such occasions, was it not trying? And do you\r\nwonder that it was a great relief for her to know she was to be freed\r\nfrom this ordeal; that she was to experience not only a complete change\r\nof scene, but the change was to be every way agreeable, and what she\r\nwould, under ordinary circumstances, have most desired?\r\n\r\nTo visit Europe! In those days the affair was not one of such common\r\noccurrence as at present, and of course the trip was the more valued.\r\n\r\nBravo, Emma! Next Thursday you will be on the ocean, away from every\r\ndisagreeable association. Much as we shall miss you, we must bid you\r\ngood-by for the present.\r\n\r\nEmma did not close her eyes in sleep that night, and if her heart beat\r\nwith excitement at the thought of the sudden change in her destinies,\r\nimmediate as well as remote, there were moments when its pulses were\r\ndeadened, and a thick, brooding, unhappy melancholy took possession of\r\nit, as she thought of what she had lost. A pang--it was that of\r\n_disappointed love_--from time to time made itself felt with keenness,\r\nand the morning found her restless and ill at ease. Could it be\r\notherwise?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Hiram received the summons to attend Dr. Chellis in his study, he\r\nwas in the midst of a calculation as to the profit and loss of a certain\r\noperation, which I do not propose to explain to the reader. He had\r\nintended to call on the Doctor immediately on his return from Hampton,\r\nbut was too much occupied. When, however, he came to a sudden break with\r\nMrs. Tenant (_he_ did not intend it should be sudden), he felt the\r\nnecessity of fortifying himself in the church, for he was well aware of\r\nthe deservedly high character Mr. Tenant enjoyed in it. He did not know\r\nthe intimate relations which existed between him and the Doctor.\r\n\r\nAlthough the weather was exceedingly warm, Hiram wore his complete suit\r\nof black cloth, and as he came with downcast eyes and mincing steps into\r\nthe Doctor's room, the latter, who had taken his accustomed seat before\r\nhis table, looked at him as he would at some strange, extraordinary\r\napparition. He returned Hiram's salutation so gravely that it checked\r\nany further advance toward shaking hands. He proceeded, however, to take\r\na seat without waiting to be asked.\r\n\r\n'Something wrong,' he said to himself. 'It can't be he has heard of it\r\nso soon--only this very afternoon; impossible. Perhaps he is at work on\r\nhis sermon. I must apologize.'\r\n\r\nThereupon Hiram took courage, and said, in a bland tone:\r\n\r\n'I fear I am interrupting you in your valuable labors; shall I not call\r\nanother time?'\r\n\r\n'No; I am quite at liberty;' and the Doctor looked as if he would ask,\r\n'What do you want?'\r\n\r\n'You have without doubt heard of my affliction,' groaned Hiram,\r\nproducing his pocket handkerchief.\r\n\r\n'Your mother died lately, I understand.'\r\n\r\nHiram's answer was inaudible; his face was buried in his handkerchief.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor was becoming impatient.\r\n\r\n'What is the object of your visit?' he asked.\r\n\r\nThe handkerchief was instantly removed from Hiram's face. He cast his\r\neyes reproachfully on the Doctor, and exclaimed, quite in a natural\r\ntone:\r\n\r\n'Object! are you not my pastor; am I not suffering? Have I not been\r\nwatching for weeks at my mother's dying bed? And now she has gone, I\r\nfeel unhappy, very unhappy. I want your advice and sympathy, and\r\nspiritual direction.'\r\n\r\nThe Doctor was staggered--I say staggered, not convinced, not persuaded,\r\nnot in any sense inclined to change his opinion of the young man before\r\nhim. But a blow had been well put in, and he felt it.\r\n\r\nFor Hiram, not imagining the Doctor could have heard of the affair with\r\nMiss Tenant, thought his treatment owing to some sort of caprice, and he\r\nseized the opportunity to act on the offensive, and dealt so genuine a\r\nretort that the former was taken by surprise. For a moment he seemed to\r\nbe in a revery.\r\n\r\n'You have lost your mother,' he said dreamily, while his large features\r\nworked with an involuntary movement, betraying strong inward\r\nemotion--'your mother; an irreparable loss. Tell me, Meeker,' he\r\ncontinued, after a pause, while he turned his large, searching gray\r\neyes on the young man, 'tell me, did you really love your mother?'\r\n\r\nIt would have been, one would suppose, the easiest thing in the world\r\nfor the glib-tongued Hiram to reply to such an interrogatory; but there\r\nwas something awful in that gaze--not severe, nor stern, nor\r\ncondemnatory, but awful in its earnest, truthful, not to be escaped\r\npenetration.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, he stammered, he changed color. Still those eyes regarded\r\nhim--still Hiram continued to hesitate, and stammer, till some sort of\r\nresponse came out, by piecemeal, incoherently.\r\n\r\nMeantime the Doctor had recovered from his revery.\r\n\r\n'You have been very unhappy?' he asked, in a dry tone.\r\n\r\n'Oh yes, very.'\r\n\r\n'What have you to say about your relations with Miss Tenant?'\r\n\r\n'He has heard all about it,' thought Hiram, 'and I must do the best I\r\ncan.' 'Why, sir, in my present afflicted state, how could I form so\r\nimportant a tie as that of matrimony? So it was thought best by Mrs.\r\nTenant that the engagement should be considered at an end, at least for\r\nthe present. This was her own suggestion, I assure you.'\r\n\r\n'Look you, Meeker,' said Dr. Chellis, endeavoring to restrain his anger,\r\n'I have heard the other side of this story, and had you not called on\r\nme, I should have sent for you. I cannot permit such a course as you are\r\ncharged with to go without the action of the church.'\r\n\r\n'By what right does the church undertake to supervise my domestic\r\naffairs?' retorted Hiram, now fully roused, and at bay.\r\n\r\n'The church will always take official notice of misconduct on the part\r\nof any of its members.'\r\n\r\n'With what am I charged?' demanded Hiram, defiantly.\r\n\r\n'With violation of the most sacred of promises, with prevarication,\r\ndissimulation, and moral fraud.'\r\n\r\n'Since it is determined to prejudge me, I shall ask for a letter of\r\ndismission, and worship elsewhere.'\r\n\r\n'I cannot grant you a letter while you are under charges.'\r\n\r\n'And do you call it fair to persecute, in this way, at the instigation\r\nof a proud aristocrat (he had already learned this slang sophistry), a\r\nyoung man, who is almost a stranger among you?'\r\n\r\n'Meeker,' said the Doctor, once more relaxing into a meditative tone,\r\n'Meeker, you have asked for my advice and spiritual direction: Answer\r\nme, answer me truly; have you really no idea, at least to some extent,\r\nwhat sort of person you are?'\r\n\r\n'Dr. Chellis, I will no longer sit here to be insulted by you, sir. I\r\nhave borne quite too much already. I will endure it no longer. Good\r\nevening, sir.'\r\n\r\nHiram flung himself out of the room. He was not at all angry, though he\r\naffected to be. Things were working heavily against him, and he saw no\r\nway to retreat except to fly in a passion or appear to do so. Once out\r\nof the house, he breathed more freely, and hastening home, he without\r\ndelay set about the labor of reconstruction. He had uphill work, but\r\ndifficulties brought out his resources.\r\n\r\nHis first step was to make a written request for a letter of dismissal,\r\non the ground that he was about to remove to the church of the Rev.\r\nDr.----.\r\n\r\nThe request for a letter was refused, and Hiram's course thereon is of a\r\ncharacter so important that it deserves to be treated of in a separate\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Emma Tenant is safely across the Atlantic, and, amid new and\r\ninteresting and romantic scenes, which she is already beginning to\r\nenjoy, she tries to forget her heart's first grief.\r\n\r\nShe will succeed. To aid her, she has her woman's pride against her\r\nwoman's weakness; a constant succession of fresh and novel incidents,\r\nagreeable society, absence from old associations, the natural buoyancy\r\nof youth, and a hopeful nature.\r\n\r\nOver this host of fortunate circumstances presides that unconquered and\r\nalways successful leader--TIME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEFFERSON DAVIS AND REPUDIATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n     This article, published in our August issue, has awakened so wide\r\n     an interest in the community, that the Editor of THE CONTINENTAL\r\n     deems it expedient to place before its readers the additional\r\n     matter contained in a _later_ edition published in England, where\r\n     it has circulated by thousands. We regret that this edition did not\r\n     arrive in time to appear at large in our August number; but as it\r\n     did not, we herewith offer the additional matter so arranged that\r\n     our readers will have but little difficulty in fitting it in its\r\n     appropriate place.\r\n\r\n     Addition 1st.--August CONTINENTAL, page 219, after line 23 from the\r\n     top, viz.: 'and the countrywomen of the Mother of the Lord,' read:\r\n\r\n\r\nMississippi was the _first_ repudiating State; A.G. McNutt, the _first_\r\nrepudiating Governor; and Jefferson Davis, the _first_ repudiating\r\nSenator. As another evidence of the incredible extent to which the\r\npublic sentiment of that day was debased, I quote the following passage\r\nfrom Governor McNutt's message of 1840, proposing to repeal the bank\r\ncharters, and to _legalize_ the _forgery_ of their notes--'The issuing\r\nof paper money, in contravention of the repealing act, could be\r\neffectually checked by the abrogation of all laws making it penal to\r\nforge such paper.' (Sen. Jour. p. 53.) Surely, nothing, but the fell\r\nspirit of slavery, could have dictated such a sentiment.\r\n\r\n     Proceed as before.\r\n\r\n     Page 220 CONTINENTAL, after line 45 from the top, viz.: 'is a\r\n     constitutional act,' insert:\r\n\r\nThe supplemental act, we have seen, was not, in the language of the\r\nConstitution, a law '_to raise a loan of money on the credit of the\r\nState_;' that act had already passed two successive Legislatures, and\r\nwas unchanged by the supplemental, which merely modified some of the\r\ndetails of the bank charter; such was the fact, and such the decree of\r\nthe inferior court, such was the unanimous decision of the highest\r\njudicial tribunal of the State, to which _the final adjudication_ had\r\nbeen assigned, by a mandatory provision of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nSurely this decision should have settled the question. But it did not.\r\nJefferson Davis, notwithstanding his professed desire to submit this\r\nquestion to the final decree of the courts of the State, persisted, as\r\nwe have seen, in 1849, in repudiating these bonds, at a period more than\r\nseven years after this decision of 1842, and still persevered, after the\r\nsecond similar adjudication of 1853.\r\n\r\n     Omitting 'Surely this decision should have settled the question.\r\n     But it did not,' proceed as before.\r\n\r\n     Page 23. On last line of the page, 'after this wide domain,'\r\n     insert:\r\n\r\nWho conspired to assassinate the American President on his way to\r\nWashington? Who murdered in Baltimore the men of Massachusetts on their\r\nway to the defence of the capitol of the Union? Who commenced the\r\nconflict by firing upon the starving garrison of Sumter, and striking\r\ndown the banner of the Union which floated over its walls? Who,\r\nimmediately thereafter, announced their resolution to capture\r\nWashington, seized the national arms, and forts, and dockyards, and\r\nvessels, and arsenals, and mints, and treasure, and opened the war upon\r\nthe Federal Government?\r\n\r\n     Returning to last line, page 27, proceed as before.\r\n\r\n     Page 224, fifth line from the bottom find: 'broad basis of the will\r\n     of the people.' After which insert:\r\n\r\nBut, let me resume the debate. When the ministry had closed, the earnest\r\nopponents of slavery, and true friends of England and America, discussed\r\nthe question. Seldom have such great speeches been heard on any\r\noccasion, and the impression was most profound.\r\n\r\nWhat is it England is asked to recognize? It is a confederacy, claiming\r\nto be a _league of sovereign and independent States_, like the old\r\nAmerican Confederacy of 1778, abandoned when we formed a nation in 1787.\r\nWhen England, in 1783, recognized the old Confederacy, the recognition\r\nwas of _each of the several States by name_, as sovereign and\r\nindependent. Now, applying those principles on the present occasion, to\r\nthe several seceded States by name, Is Virginia independent? Why, all\r\nher coasts and seaports are held by us, so is Norfolk, her commercial\r\ncapital, more than half her area and white population, and nearly half\r\nher territory has been organized as a new State of the Union, and, by\r\nthe almost unanimous vote of her people, has abolished slavery. Are\r\nNorth and South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Texas\r\nindependent? Why, their whole coast and large portions of the interior\r\nare held by our army and navy. Is Tennessee independent? Two thirds of\r\nher territory, as well as her political and commercial capitals,\r\nNashville and Memphis, are held by us. The same thing is true, to a\r\ngreat extent, as to Arkansas. As to Mississippi--her whole sea coast,\r\nand her whole river coast, for 500 miles, with the exception of a single\r\npoint, are held by us, and more than half her territory. As to\r\nLouisiana, we hold three fourths of her territory, all her sea coast,\r\nall her river front on both banks of the Mississippi, except one point,\r\nand her great city, New Orleans, the commercial capital of the State and\r\nof the South, with four times the population of any other Southern city,\r\nand with nearly half the free population of the State. More than three\r\nfourths of the population as well as area of Louisiana is held by us,\r\nwith her political and commercial capital, and yet it is proposed to\r\nacknowledge Louisiana as one of these _sovereign and independent\r\nStates_. How can the so-called Confederacy, claiming to be a league of\r\nsovereign and independent States, be recognized as independent, when the\r\nStates composing that league are not independent? How is Richmond to be\r\nreached by an English envoy, or is the blockade to be broken, which is\r\nwar? How as to slavery! The 331,000 slaves of Louisiana, the three\r\nmillions of slaves of the seceded States, are emancipated by the\r\nproclamation of the President, under the war power uniformly recognized\r\nas constitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States. If these\r\nare States of our Union, or are retained by us, slavery has ceased, and\r\nthe _three millions of slaves are free_. But, if you acknowledge the\r\nconfederate independence, then, these three millions of slaves, so far\r\nas England is concerned, are slaves still, and will remain so forever.\r\nTo refuse recognition, is to admit the freedom of these slaves--to\r\nrecognize, is to remand them to bondage, so far as England can\r\naccomplish that purpose. Nor is this all--it is to spread slavery over\r\nan almost boundless territory, claimed by the South. It is impossible\r\nthen to escape the conclusion, that, in recognizing this confederacy,\r\nEngland ranges herself on the side of slavery, and does all she can to\r\nmaintain and perpetuate it in America. Nor is this all. She violates a\r\ngreat moral rule, and a well settled principle of international law, to\r\nmaintain and perpetuate slavery in the South. By the law of nations, the\r\nrecognition of national independence is the acknowledgment of the fact\r\nof independence. But, we have seen, that the States composing this\r\nso-called league, are not independent, but are held, to a vast extent,\r\nby our army and navy, including two thirds of their area. Never was\r\nindependence acknowledged under such circumstances, except as an act of\r\nwar. The acknowledgment then of the confederate independence, in the\r\npresent posture of affairs, is, in fact, _a declaration of war by\r\nEngland against the United States, without cause or justification_. It\r\nwould be so universally regarded in the United States, and would\r\ninstantly _close all dissensions in the North_. If any suppose that\r\nEngland, without any just cause, should thus strike us with the\r\niron-gauntleted hand, and that we will not resist, let the history of\r\nthe past answer the question. Nor would the union of France, in such an\r\nact, change the result, except that nearly all the loss and sacrifice\r\nwould fall upon England. Including the slaves and free blacks, there is\r\nnot a single seceded State, in which an overwhelming majority of the\r\npeople are not for the Union. Now, by the Federal Constitution, slaves\r\nare mentioned only three times, and then not as slaves, but as\r\n'_persons_,' and the Supreme Court of the United States have expressly\r\ndecided that slaves, so far as regards the United States, _are persons,\r\nand not property_. (Groves _vs._ Slaughter, 15 Peters, 392.) _All\r\npersons_, in every State, owe a paramount allegiance to the United\r\nStates, the rebel masters, as well as their slaves--the Government has a\r\nright to their services to suppress the rebellion; and to acknowledge\r\nthe independence of the South, is to ignore the existence of the slaves,\r\nor to treat them, as the South do, as chattels, and not persons. In\r\nacknowledging, then, Southern independence, the independence of the\r\n_masters_, England expressly recognizes the doctrine of _property in\r\nman_. Such a war, proclaimed by England and France against the United\r\nStates on such grounds, would be a war of their _Governments_--not of\r\ntheir _peoples_, and could have but one termination. As to our\r\nrecognition of the independence of Texas, it was long after the decisive\r\nbattle of San Jacinto,--when the Mexican army was destroyed or captured,\r\ntogether with the President, when he acknowledged their independence,\r\nthe Mexican Government, by accepting the advantages stipulated by him,\r\nin fact, and in law, ratified the recognition. It was after all this,\r\nwhen the contest was over, not a Mexican vessel on the coast of Texas,\r\nnor a Mexican soldier upon her soil, that we recognized the independence\r\nof Texas. The case, therefore, is widely different from the present. Let\r\nit be remembered, that we hold, not only the mouth of the Mississippi,\r\nits great city, the whole of the west bank of that imperial river, but\r\nall the east bank, except two points, thus dissevering Texas, Louisiana,\r\nand Arkansas from the rest of the South. Now the area of these three\r\nStates is 373,000 square miles, and that of all the remaining seceded\r\nStates, 396,000 square miles. In holding then the west bank of the\r\nMississippi, we have severed the great artery of the South, which is\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n     With these additions, easily supplied, our readers have before them\r\n     the whole of Governor Walker's letter,--ED. CONTINENTAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S TABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nREADERS: It were much to be wished, for your benefit, that the stalwart\r\nform which has so long presided at our Table, should take the accustomed\r\nplace at our Banquet, again to serve you with the invigorating fare fit\r\nfor men; the dainties of delicious flavor suited to the taste of the\r\nyoung and lovely; or once more to pour the accustomed draughts of old\r\nFalernian, sunned by a warm heart and matured by a vigorous intellect,\r\ninto the goblets you are now holding for our September festival. For\r\naught we know, he may even now be treading the old fields of former\r\nglory in far Kansas--but his voice will soon again greet you from this\r\nsocial spot, and again spread before you the ripe fruits of a manly\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nOur other Honorable Editor is also afar, striving in other climes to\r\nserve our country, yet constantly giving us reason to know, from his\r\nfrequent and loyal contributions, that he is gathering honey for THE\r\nCONTINENTAL, and has not deserted his arduous post in spending and being\r\nspent for the land he loves. May our two Honorables soon return to\r\ndispense, as they alone can, the hospitalities of our Editor's Table!\r\n\r\nBut we should not complain, when we can offer you, in this month of hot\r\nsuns and motionless airs, such invigorating breaths of fresh, salty\r\nwind, directly from the bosom of the surging sea, as we are about to do\r\nin the following essay from the pen of A. J. S. He is the author of the\r\nvigorous sketch of 'The Southern Colonel' given in our July issue. He\r\nhas now dipped his pen in the tints of the rainbow and the freshness of\r\nthe salty wave, and given us:\r\n\r\n\r\n'FROM THE SEA SHORE.'\r\n\r\nWhere the land enchants, the sea intoxicates--its sparkle, its mobility,\r\nits translucence excite the fancy, as wine does the blood--it combines\r\nthose elements which produce at once awe and ecstasy in the soul--the\r\nunknown, the resistless, the beautiful. One may be melancholy by the\r\nsea, but never morbid or supine. Between it and the land there are no\r\ngradations; you do not come imperceptibly under its influence, as, in\r\nascending a mountain, you come into the cooler atmosphere; as you\r\napproach, you are suddenly enveloped and animated by a crystalline,\r\nvivifying element: this is the sea air; those saline qualities, so harsh\r\nto the taste, prove a delicious stimulant in the lungs. The sea is\r\nincommunicable--neither words, or canvas prepare you for it, as they may\r\noften for landscapes; like Livingston's untutored savage, you are always\r\nstartled and overwhelmed at first sight of it; you feel, like him, an\r\nimpulse to leap into its waves. If you want to surrender yourself wholly\r\nto the sea influence--to study it and assimilate your mind to all its\r\nphases--you should choose, as was my fortune, a little fishing town, on\r\nthe shore, with a sheltered bay to the south and west and the ocean\r\neastward. Here you will find life stripped of care and conventionality;\r\nidealized, seductive, and illusive, the days swinging from charm to\r\ncharm, like bubbles in the sunlight. On such a coast, Nature never\r\nconfuses her effects--no lively verdure or picturesque landscape\r\nintrudes upon the majesty of the sea--only damp mosses and stout\r\ncreepers veil the harsh outlines of the rocks, and, in the distance,\r\nmasses of pine trees relieve the gray monotony of the shore--for the\r\nrest, everything is left to the sun and the sea. There are a dozen\r\nbeaches, each distinct in its charm. Some firm, smooth, and white, as a\r\nmarble walk--others mere waves of sand, which the lightest breeze\r\nwhirls--and, others, where nature seems to have exhausted her wildest\r\ncaprice, piled with rocks, black, perilous, defiant, overlooking waters\r\nwhose solitude is never broken by a sail. It is these deep waters which\r\nhave that green tint so lustrous and subtle, and as unlike the heavy\r\ngreen seen in most sea pictures as it is unlike grass; it is in more\r\nsheltered nooks that the sea assumes that sapphire sheen more ineffable\r\nthan the sky which imparts it. As the color of the sea depends greatly\r\nupon the disposition of the surrounding lands and the prevailing\r\ncondition of the atmosphere, each little inlet has some tint or effect\r\nof light peculiar to itself. I have seen coloring as remarkable--I had\r\nalmost said as unnatural--as that indigo blue which we connect with the\r\nÆgean sea. Indeed, one comes to believe anything possible in the way of\r\nsea coloring, however brilliant, or however blank, after intimate and\r\nclose observation of even a small part of the ocean. I have often\r\nfancied that these local features may have given rise to the idea of\r\nnymphs and mermaids, especially at night, when, in the setting sun, the\r\ncolors fade in vapory exhalations, and the waters seem haunted by the\r\nspirits of their own beauty--pale, tremulous, waiting the vitalizing ray\r\nof the morning light. But it is in winter that the effects of the sun on\r\nthe sea are most marvellous; this arises, in part, from the clearness of\r\nthe air, and the dazzling setting of snow, which expresses more vividly\r\nthe glow of the sea; then, too, that part of the water not exposed to\r\nthe sun has an ashen, gray tint, which intensifies, by contrast, the\r\nmore gorgeous hues. I remember many who saw Church's 'Icebergs' thought\r\nthe coloring too brilliant, while, to those familiar with the sea, it\r\nseemed entirely natural. Thus, critics will find that it is by the study\r\nof nature we are educated up to high art; and artists, that their great\r\ndanger is not in being more brilliant, but less delicate than nature. It\r\nis on the sea shore that we find the purest democracy--any man who is\r\nrespectable and desirous of enjoying life may fraternize with the whole\r\npopulation. He who lives in the struggle to acquire or maintain a\r\nposition can appreciate this social luxury. The sea exercises a\r\ndelightful influence over the character--its perils induce self-reliance\r\nand fearlessness, which are redeemed from conceit by a child-like\r\nsimplicity arising naturally from the contemplation of an element\r\nmenacing, invincible, and symbolical of eternity. Then, too, the legends\r\nof the sea invest the mind with a sensitive, poetic passion as\r\ndelightful as it is unworldly, as reverent as it is credulous. No one\r\nwould deride these superstitions who has watched, as I have, the various\r\nphases of the sea--its motions, its intonations--its mists, its foam,\r\nits vapors--its sunlit splendors--its phosphorescent marvels--its\r\nmoonlit and starlit mysteries; but would feel, with something of the awe\r\nof the ancients, that the sea is the place of magic, and that only a\r\nfilm separates between the material and the spirit land.\r\n\r\n                                         A. J. S.\r\n\r\n\r\nREADERS: You with ourselves have looked upon a very ugly thing since we\r\nlast met in the pages of THE CONTINENTAL. A Briareus-handed,\r\nmultiple-formed, Proteus-faced monster, of huge dimensions, wickedly\r\nscheming brain, myriad fanged, and every fang imbued with virulent\r\ncopperhead poison, stormed through our streets in the light of day and\r\nin the gloom of night, during many ghastly hours, knowing no law save\r\nits own wicked will, while Treason, Cruelty, House-breaking and\r\nHouse-burning, Robbery, Assassination, Torture, Hanging, Murder, stalked\r\non in its wild train of horror. But we know its face now, and it will be\r\nour own fault if anything so foul shall e'er be seen again in our midst.\r\nWe must be on the alert to act when called upon--not to suspect the\r\ninnocent, but to guard against the guilty.\r\n\r\n                   'Thus do all traitors:\r\n   If their purgation did consist in words,\r\n   They are as innocent as grace itself.'\r\n\r\n'There is no fear of God in a riot.' We must confess ourselves to have\r\nbeen strangely startled when we found of what nation the rioters were\r\nmainly composed. The race whom we had received with the most generous\r\nhospitality, rescuing them from starvation and oppression at home--men\r\nwhom we were hourly teaching to be freemen; women whom we were patiently\r\nand painfully instructing in the domestic arts of civilized life, took\r\nup arms against our Government, our laws, and ruthlessly pursued the\r\ninnocent with fire and sword! The race of the old faith of the true St.\r\nPatrick, fresh from the 'Isle of Saints,' from which he had himself\r\nexiled all copperheads and venomous reptiles, blessed with good and true\r\nPriests of the old Religion, with the sweet face of the Blessed Virgin\r\nMary to smile down upon them in their chapels, teaching them reverence\r\nfor womanhood, and feeding as they firmly believe upon the glorified\r\nBody which is hourly broken to exalt and purify humanity, fell in fierce\r\nassault upon us. Men from the land of Burke, Curran, Emmet, Moore,\r\nMeagher, rose to pillage, burn, and assassinate! Irishmen, afraid to\r\nfight for the country which had adopted them as sons! massacring their\r\nbenefactors! trailing Old Erin's loyal harp for the _first time_ in the\r\ndust! bringing shame on the glorious Emerald Isle, and sorrow to the\r\nstruggling country which had given them a home! Irishmen, taking the\r\nlaws in their own hands, trampling our Stars beneath their feet--that\r\nflag which had first assured them they were men, citizens, with a\r\n_right_ to home and happiness! What wonder that we fail to recognize the\r\nstrong, sturdy, brave, heady, helpful, generous, and impulsive children\r\nof the 'Gem of the Sea?' And what shall we say of the venerated\r\nArchbishop?\r\n\r\n   'By holy Paul, they love his Grace but lightly,\r\n    That fill his ears with traitorous, murderous rumors.'\r\n\r\nAlas! the worst is not yet told. Irishmen and Irishwomen, with the sad\r\nface of the Mother of the Lord for ever teaching them pity from their\r\naltars, fell like fiends from hell upon the unfortunate negro, driving\r\nhim, a child of Christ, from the poor home he had won with so much toil;\r\nrobbing him of all he possessed; burning his miserable refuge;\r\nfrightening into madness his patient wife; braining his children;\r\nhounding the panic-stricken unfortunate from street to street, and\r\ntorturing, mutilating, drowning, and assassinating him! For what, in the\r\nname of Heaven? Because he breathed the air of his native land, and\r\ndared to pray to the God that made him; because he wanted work for his\r\nblack and brawny arm, to support his cheerful black wife, and his jolly,\r\nwoolly-headed children!\r\n\r\n   'Go back; the _virtue of your name_\r\n    Is not here passable!' 'A thousand knees\r\n    Six thousand years together, naked, fasting,\r\n    Upon a barren mountain, and still winter\r\n    In storm perpetual, could not move the gods\r\n    To look that way thou wouldst.'\r\n\r\nIt has been said the negro was lazy, and would not work without the\r\nlash; that he was incompetent, and could not work; that he was a coward,\r\nand would not fight: when it is found that he will work, he is to be\r\ndeprived of labor; found that he can work, deprived of employment; that\r\nhe is loyal, and will fight for the country, although she has often been\r\nbut a stepmother to him; he is driven from his home; his goods plundered\r\nand fired; himself mutilated and hung. Alas! alas! 'mine eyes are a\r\nfountain of tears for the iniquities of my people!'\r\n\r\n'Ireland knows no martyrs,' nobly says the Archbishop. Alas! that she\r\nshould have martyred the negro upon our own _holy_ soil--the soil of his\r\nnativity!\r\n\r\nGod curses no race, for Christ died for _all_ who will accept him. Even\r\nwere this plea of cursing true, it is our simple duty to try to lift the\r\ncurse. To do unto others as we would be done by, is the sublime but\r\nsimple law of Christianity.\r\n\r\nReaders and fellow citizens, let us resolve that all this must cease; we\r\nmust be ready to put down rebellion _North_ as well as South; to resist\r\nall violence and aggression; to support the Government; to fill with\r\nenthusiasm the glorious ranks of our brave army, because it is the army\r\nof freedom and human progress; we must all aid in carrying our flag\r\nwithout a star undimmed through this fierce crisis, and unfurl it in\r\nthat fair field of universal liberty and happiness which we must win for\r\nthe sweet sake of humanity. All hell is armed against us; but God and\r\nHis angels are on our side! This is the _manifest destiny_ of our\r\ncountry, and to this unveiled glory are we marching on. We proudly offer\r\na home and freedom to men of all climes and regions; in which hospitable\r\noffer itself we declare that no dictation, no oppression, no cruelty\r\nshall legally exist throughout the length and breadth of this our Holy\r\nLand. We have aims before us, and we must accomplish them. The Irishman\r\nmust be civilized, his better feelings must be cultivated; he must be\r\ntaught to respect law and order; the American copperhead must be robbed\r\nof his power to harm; he has shown his deadly venom, and his fangs must\r\nbe extracted; to do this effectively, the rebellion, already crushed,\r\nmust be utterly subdued; the negro must be protected, educated, and\r\nelevated; slavery in every form must be driven from the earth; the law\r\nof love, which is the law of God, must rule; that so our Heaven-Stars\r\nmay again cluster in ever-growing brilliancy and lustre over a land of\r\nequality, progress, law, order, unity, and happiness. Men and brethren,\r\nthis is our allotted task, and we must all work in our allotted spheres.\r\nMen, women, and children, there is enough to do, and that which will\r\ntask us all to our utmost strength and capacity. We must be brave,\r\nstrong, helpful, and unselfish; we must shirk no duty on the score of\r\nsex or weakness; we must find excuse for no idleness on the ground of\r\nincapacity. We are all capable! We must feel and make others feel that\r\nthere is no true hope for ourselves or them save in the triumph of our\r\nsacred cause. Our stars alone form canopy wide enough to shelter the\r\never-accumulating ranks of humanity. We must, every one of us, learn the\r\nlesson of self-abnegation--it is the sublime lesson of the cross,\r\nlearned by St. Paul, lived by St. John, worshipped by the Magdalene, and\r\nincarnated through the Virgin Mary--thus proving it is for all classes,\r\ncharacters, and sexes. He who will not learn it, is neither hero nor\r\nChristian, be he general or bishop.\r\n\r\nWe shall first (because it is necessary for the progress of the race)\r\nconquer our enemies; and then, true to ourselves and our principles,\r\nforgive, aid, and love them. Many of them have learned, many more are\r\nlearning, the misery and shame of slavery. That truth once acknowledged\r\nand digested, their hearts will grow glad in the peace of the just, and\r\ntheir desolated land blossom like the rose.\r\n\r\nWe will all learn to bear with the negro, because he has qualities\r\nnecessary to fill up the harmony of life. As a general thing, the Irish\r\nservants are perhaps more honest, and dull as they seem, have more head;\r\nbut the negro has more heart. His nature is irrepressible and joyous; he\r\nis full of comicality and drollery, of fun, jeers, jokes, yah-yas, and\r\nmerriment; and this element will be needed in our midst to temper our\r\npuritan and national seriousness. He loves music whether sad, burlesque,\r\nor gay; is devoted to those who treat him worthily, his affections being\r\neasily won; and there is something touching, soothing, and delightful in\r\nhis inherent respect for gentleman and lady. His aptitude for domestic\r\nservice; his love for and his power of amusing children and winning\r\ntheir fickle heart, their attachment to him being one of the most\r\ndelightful traits of Southern life; his impressible, religious and\r\ndevout nature, mark him as a wonderful element of variety in the\r\ndomestic texture of our life such as it shall be when he is free,\r\neducated in accordance with his nature, and happy. He is not ambitious,\r\nhe likes to serve those who treat him kindly, and seeks no _social_\r\nequality, as do the Irish, whatever position they may hold. I do not\r\ndeny that this is a good strong trait in a race, but it does not make an\r\n_agreeable_ servant. Our Biddys and Pollys flaunt and flounce to\r\nconvince us they are as good as we; the negro acknowledges superior\r\ndeportment, and is ever submissive and respectful to those who know how\r\nto treat him. I think when this 'tyranny is overpast' that it will be\r\nhard to induce us to part with the negro. He is embodied humor; fun and\r\nnaive pathos alternate with the most startling rapidity in his wild but\r\nloving soul, in which the feminine element of passion generally\r\npredominates over sustained virile strength; he is spontaneity\r\nitself--and the reflective Anglo-Saxon race will learn to appreciate\r\nsuch promptings of our basic nature. He is happy in serving, and as a\r\nservant, is invaluable.\r\n\r\nStern duties are then before us in this world of the mighty West; let us\r\naccept them with a willing heart. Our women can do much, for men are\r\nwidely severed in opinion; and the social element, woman's true and\r\nnoble sphere, must be made available to bring about a better feeling.\r\nLet her so arrange that we shall see more of each other socially, not in\r\ngrand _fêtes_, tiresome dinners, idle pomposities, but in simple and\r\nhospitable greetings, in frequent, unrestrained, and easy commune. She\r\nmust learn to take a conversational part in the great questions of the\r\nday, soothing asperities, and bringing hearts together as she alone can;\r\nfor women possess _naturally_ the secret of society. Let us not ask in\r\nwhat rank men and women move, but rather what they are, and if noble,\r\nlet us take them to our hearts. Let us struggle individually to the\r\nheight of our aspirations, assured that if we so do, this glorious Union\r\nis destined to be perpetuated in ever-increasing glory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMOR PATRIÆ VINCIT.\r\n\r\n   Red: White: Blue.\r\n   Love: Peace: Heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n   God of justice, smile upon us!\r\n     Justice yet will rule our land;\r\n   Equal rights bless native, alien,\r\n     High or low, from every strand;\r\n   Pledged within our Constitution,\r\n     They will bless a woe-worn world:\r\n   God, 'tis Justice makes it holy--\r\n     _Freedom's Charter_ wide unfurled!\r\n\r\n   _Chorus:_\r\n\r\n   Float, O Flag, reflecting Heaven! where God plants the clustering stars,\r\n   In the blue depths of thy infinite--so vast that nothing jars!\r\n\r\n   God of mercy, smile upon us!\r\n     Mercy yet shall rule our land;\r\n   Thought be free, all creeds untrammelled,\r\n     Honor follow labor's hand;\r\n   All be equal; men be brothers;\r\n     They must work who fain would soar,\r\n   Work in earnest for the _Human_,--\r\n     Pride and scorn be known no more.\r\n\r\n   _Chorus:_\r\n\r\n   Float, O Flag of mystic colors; red with love; star-gemmed thy Blue;\r\n   Peace blends in white thy Rainbow light, and waves her snow-wings\r\n      through!\r\n\r\n   God of love, O smile upon us!\r\n     Love shall shine through all our laws;\r\n   Love shall link each State in Union;\r\n     Love which knows nor rest, nor pause.\r\n   Love is central Heart of nations;\r\n     Love will draw all wandering stars\r\n   To our field of boundless azure,\r\n     Held by God from all that mars!\r\n\r\n   Chorus:\r\n\r\n   Wildly pours our hearts' blood on thee--crimson current warm and true,\r\n   Each dead hero links us closer--float on Flag, Red, White, and Blue!\r\n\r\n   God of Union, smile upon us!\r\n     Flag of Union, greet the skies!\r\n   On thy stars and _chording_ colors\r\n     Every hope for mortals lies!\r\n   Blasted be the hand would strike thee!\r\n     Blighted heart and palsied brain!\r\n   Float till earth knows no oppression,\r\n     Falsehood, bondage, slavery, pain!\r\n\r\n   Chorus:\r\n\r\n   Float, Flag of love; fused States and lives! shine stars on God's own\r\n      Blue!\r\n   Love's crimson current gird them close! white-winged Peace wind through!\r\n\r\n                                         M.

They found her too gay, too\r\n         active, too strong, and too beautiful. They said: 'Let us tear\r\n         off her wings, let us load her with chains, let us lay her low\r\n         with blows, let her suffer, let her die:\r\n\r\n     The Goddess--the strong Goddess of Poverty!'\r\n\r\n\r\n     IV.\r\n\r\n     They chained the good Goddess, they bruised and persecuted her, but\r\n         they could not degrade her, for she sought refuge in the souls\r\n         of poets, in the souls of peasants, in the souls of women, in\r\n         the souls of artists, in the souls of saints:\r\n\r\n     The Goddess--the good Goddess of Poverty!\r\n\r\n\r\n     V.\r\n\r\n     She has travelled longer than the Wandering Jew; she has journeyed\r\n         farther than the swallow; she is older than the cathedral of\r\n         Prague, yet younger than the little egg of the golden-crested\r\n         wren; she has multiplied more upon the earth than the crimson\r\n         strawberry in the green woods of Bohemia:\r\n\r\n     The Goddess--the good Goddess of Poverty!\r\n\r\n\r\n     VI.\r\n\r\n     She is the mother of many children, and has taught them all the\r\n         secrets of God; she spoke to the heart of Jesus upon the mount;\r\n         to the eyes of Queen Libussa when she loved a peasant; to the\r\n         spirit of John and Jerome on the pyre of Constance; she has\r\n         more knowledge than all the doctors and all the bishops:\r\n\r\n     The Goddess--the good Goddess of Poverty!\r\n\r\n\r\n     VII.\r\n\r\n     She makes all the grand and beautiful things that are to be seen\r\n         upon the earth; it is she who cultivates the fields and prunes\r\n         the trees; it is she who leads the flocks, breathing songs from\r\n         her heart; it is she who catches the first crimsoning of the\r\n         dawn, who receives the first smile of the rising sun:\r\n\r\n     The Goddess--the good Goddess of Poverty!\r\n\r\n\r\n     VIII.\r\n\r\n     It is she who twines the green branches to make a little cabin for\r\n         the woodman; who gives the piercing glance of the eagle to the\r\n         poacher; it is she who brings up the prettiest and strongest\r\n         little urchins; and who makes the spade and plough light for\r\n         the hands of the old man, whose silver locks gleam like a halo\r\n         round the wrinkled brow:\r\n\r\n     The Goddess--the good Goddess of Poverty!\r\n\r\n\r\n     IX.\r\n\r\n     It is she who inspires the poet; who makes the flute, guitar, and\r\n         violin eloquent under the fingers of the wandering and homeless\r\n         artist: it is she who bears him upon her light wing from the\r\n         source of the Moldau to that of the Danube; it is she who\r\n         crowns his dark locks with the glittering dewdrops, who makes\r\n         the sparkling stars shine so large and clear upon his uncertain\r\n         path:\r\n\r\n     The Goddess--the good Goddess of Poverty!\r\n\r\n\r\n     X.\r\n\r\n     It is she who instructs the ingenious artisan, who teaches him to\r\n         hew the stone, to chisel the marble, to mould gold, silver,\r\n         copper, and iron; it is she who, under the fingers of the aged\r\n         mother and the rose-cheeked daughter, makes the flax fine and\r\n         elastic as the golden tresses of the maiden:\r\n\r\n     The Goddess--the good Goddess of Poverty!\r\n\r\n\r\n     XI.\r\n\r\n     It is she who supports the tottering hut when shaken by the winter\r\n         storms; it is she who saves the resin of the torch and the oil\r\n         of the lamp; it is she who kneads the bread of the family, who\r\n         weaves the winter wool and summer flax; it is she who nourishes\r\n         and feeds the world: The Goddess--the good Goddess of Poverty!\r\n\r\n\r\n     XII.\r\n\r\n     It is she who builds the mighty castles and the vast cathedrals,\r\n         who bears the sword and handles the musket; it is she who\r\n         fights our battles and gains our victories; it is she who\r\n         buries the dead, who takes care of the wounded, and who\r\n         conceals the vanquished:\r\n\r\n     The Goddess--the good Goddess of Poverty!\r\n\r\n\r\n     XIII.\r\n\r\n     Thou art all patience, all sweetness, all strength, and all pity, O\r\n         thou good Goddess!

No publication of the kind has, in this country, so\r\nsuccessfully combined the energy and freedom of the daily newspaper with\r\nthe higher literary tone of the first-class monthly; and it is very\r\ncertain that no magazine has given wider range to its contributors, or\r\npreserved itself so completely from the narrow influences of party or of\r\nfaction. In times like the present, such a journal is either a power in\r\nthe land or it is nothing. That the CONTINENTAL is not the latter is\r\nabundantly evidenced _by what it has done_--by the reflection of its\r\ncounsels in many important public events, and in the character and power\r\nof those who are its staunchest supporters.\r\n\r\nThough but little more than a year has elapsed since the CONTINENTAL was\r\nfirst established, it has during that time acquired a strength and a\r\npolitical significance elevating it to a position far above that\r\npreviously occupied by any publication of the kind in America. In proof\r\nof which assertion we call attention to the following facts:\r\n\r\n1. Of its POLITICAL articles republished in pamphlet form, a single one\r\nhas had, thus far, a circulation of _one hundred and six thousand\r\ncopies_.\r\n\r\n2. From its LITERARY department, a single serial novel, \"Among the\r\nPines,\" has, within a very few months, sold nearly _thirty-five\r\nthousand_ copies. Two other series of its literary articles have also\r\nbeen republished in book form, while the first portion of a third is\r\nalready in press.\r\n\r\nNo more conclusive facts need be alleged to prove the excellence of the\r\ncontributions to the CONTINENTAL, or their _extraordinary popularity_;\r\nand its conductors are determined that it shall not fall behind.\r\nPreserving all \"the boldness, vigor, and ability\" which a thousand\r\njournals have attributed to it, it will greatly enlarge its circle of\r\naction, and discuss, fearlessly and frankly, every principle involved in\r\nthe great questions of the day. The first minds of the country,\r\nembracing the men most familiar with its diplomacy and most\r\ndistinguished for ability, are among its contributors; and it is no mere\r\n\"flattering promise of a prospectus\" to say that this \"magazine for the\r\ntimes\" will employ the first intellect in America, under auspices which\r\nno publication ever enjoyed before in this country.\r\n\r\nWhile the CONTINENTAL will express decided opinions on the great\r\nquestions of the day, it will not be a mere political journal: much the\r\nlarger portion of its columns will be enlivened, as heretofore, by\r\ntales, poetry, and humour. In a word, the CONTINENTAL will be found,\r\nunder its new staff of Editors, occupying a position and presenting\r\nattractions never before found in a magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTERMS TO CLUBS.\r\n\r\n   Two copies for one year,         Five dollars.\r\n   Three copies for one year,       Six dollars.\r\n   Six copies for one year,         Eleven dollars.\r\n   Eleven copies for one year,      Twenty dollars.\r\n   Twenty copies for one year,      Thirty-six dollars.\r\n\r\nPAID IN ADVANCE.\r\n\r\n_Postage, Thirty-six cents a year,_ TO BE PAID BY THE SUBSCRIBER.\r\n\r\nSINGLE COPIES.\r\n\r\nThree dollars a year, IN ADVANCE. _Postage paid by the Publisher._\r\n\r\nJOHN F.

No State in the Valley of\r\nMississippi offers so great an inducement to the settler as the State of\r\nIllinois. There is no part of the world where all the conditions of\r\nclimate and soil so admirable combine to produce those two great\r\nstaples, CORN and WHEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\nNowhere can the industrious farmer secure such immediate results from\r\nhis labor as on these deep, rich, loamy soils, cultivated with so much\r\nease. The climate from the extreme southern part of the State to the\r\nTerre Haute, Alton and St. Louis Railroad, a distance of nearly 200\r\nmiles, is well adapted to Winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEAT, CORN, COTTON, TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nPeaches, Pears, Tomatoes, and every variety of fruit and vegetables is\r\ngrown in great abundance, from which Chicago and other Northern markets\r\nare furnished from four to six weeks earlier than their immediate\r\nvicinity. Between the Terre Haute, Allen & St. Louis Railway and the\r\nKankakee and Illinois Rivers, (a distance of 115 miles on the Branch and\r\n136 miles on the Main Trunk,) lies the great Corn and Stock raising\r\nportion of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORDINARY YIELD\r\n\r\nof Corn is from 60 to 80 bushels per acre. Cattle, Horses, Mules, Sheep\r\nand Hogs are raised here at a small cost, and yield large profits. It is\r\nbelieved that no section of country presents greater inducements for\r\nDairy Farming than the Prairies of Illinois, a branch of farming to\r\nwhich but little attention had been paid, and which must yield sure\r\nprofitable results. Between the Kankakee and Illinois Rivers, and\r\nChicago and Dunleith, (a distance of 56 miles on the Branch and 147\r\nmiles by the Main Trunk,) Timothy Hay, Spring Wheat, Corn, &c., are\r\nproduced in great abundance.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural products of Illinois are greater than those of any\r\nother State. The Wheat crop of 1861 was estimated at 85,000,000 bushels,\r\nwhile the Corn crop yields not less than 140,000,000 bushels besides the\r\ncrop of Oats, Barley, Rye, Buckwheat, Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes,\r\nPumpkins, Squashes, Flax, Hemp, Peas, Clover, Cabbage, Beets, Tobacco,\r\nSorgheim, Grapes, Peaches, Apples, &c., which go to swell the vast\r\naggregate of production in this fertile region. Over Four Million tons\r\nof produce were sent out the State of Illinois during the past year.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOCK RAISING.\r\n\r\nIn Central and Southern Illinois uncommon advantages are presented for\r\nthe extension of Stock raising. All kinds of Cattle, Horses, Mules,\r\nSheep, Hogs, &c. of the best breeds, yield handsome profits; large\r\nfortunes have already been made, and the field is open for others to\r\nenter with the fairest prospects of like results. DAIRY FARMING also\r\npresents its inducements to many.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF COTTON.\r\n\r\n_The experiments in Cotton culture are of very great promise. Commencing\r\nin latitude 39 deg. 30 min. (see Mattoon on the Branch, and Assumption\r\non the Main Line), the Company owns thousands of acres well adapted to\r\nthe perfection of this fibre. A settler having a family of young\r\nchildren, can turn their youthful labor to a most profitable account in\r\nthe growth and perfection of this plant._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD\r\n\r\nTraverses the whole length of the State, from the banks of the\r\nMississippi and Lake Michigan to the Ohio. As its name imports, the\r\nRailroad runs through the centre of the State, and on either side of the\r\nroad along its whole length lie the lands offered for sale.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITIES, TOWNS, MARKETS, DEPOTS,\r\n\r\nThere are Ninety-eight Depots on the Company's Railway, giving about one\r\nevery seven miles. Cities, Towns, and Villages are situated at\r\nconvenient distances throughout the whole route, where every desirable\r\ncommodity may be found as readily as in the oldest cities of the Union,\r\nand where buyers are to be met for all kinds of farm produce.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATION.\r\n\r\nMechanics and working-men will find the free school system encouraged by\r\nthe State, and endowed with a large revenue for the support of the\r\nschools. Children can live in sight of the school, the college, the\r\nchurch, and grow up with the prosperity of the leading State in the\r\nGreat Western Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRICES AND TERMS OF PAYMENT--ON LONG CREDIT.\r\n\r\n80 acres at $10 per acre, with interest at 6 per ct. annually on the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\n\r\n   Cash payment            $48 00\r\n   Payment in one year      48 00\r\n      \"    in two years     48 00\r\n      \"    in three years   48 00\r\n      \"    in four years   236 00\r\n      \"    in five years   224 00\r\n      \"    in six years    212 00\r\n      \"    in seven years  200 00\r\n\r\n\r\n40 acres at $10 00 per acre;\r\n\r\n   Cash payment            $24 00\r\n   Payment in one year      24 00\r\n      \"    in two years     24 00\r\n      \"    in three years   24 00\r\n      \"    in four years   118 00\r\n      \"    in five years   112 00\r\n      \"    in six years    106 00\r\n      \"    in seven years  100 00\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   Number 22.    25 Cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n   THE\r\n\r\n   CONTINENTAL\r\n\r\n   MONTHLY.\r\n\r\n   DEVOTED TO\r\n\r\n   Literature and National Policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n   OCTOBER, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\n   NEW YORK:\r\n\r\n   JOHN F.
