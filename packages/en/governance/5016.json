The task devolves on me, under a provision of the\r\nConstitution, to present to you, as the Federal Legislature of 24\r\nsovereign States and 12,000,000 happy people, a view of our affairs,\r\nand to propose such measures as in the discharge of my official\r\nfunctions have suggested themselves as necessary to promote the objects\r\nof our Union.\r\n\r\nIn communicating with you for the first time it is to me a source of\r\nunfeigned satisfaction, calling for mutual gratulation and devout\r\nthanks to a benign Providence, that we are at peace with all man-kind,\r\nand that our country exhibits the most cheering evidence of general\r\nwelfare and progressive improvement. Turning our eyes to other nations,\r\nour great desire is to see our brethren of the human race secured in\r\nthe blessings enjoyed by ourselves, and advancing in knowledge, in\r\nfreedom, and in social happiness.\r\n\r\nOur foreign relations, although in their general character pacific and\r\nfriendly, present subjects of difference between us and other powers of\r\ndeep interest as well to the country at large as to many of our\r\ncitizens. To effect an adjustment of these shall continue to be the\r\nobject of my earnest endeavors, and not with standing the difficulties\r\nof the task, I do not allow myself to apprehend unfavorable results.\r\nBlessed as our country is with every thing which constitutes national\r\nstrength, she is fully adequate to the maintenance of all her\r\ninterests. In discharging the responsible trust confided to the\r\nExecutive in this respect it is my settled purpose to ask nothing that\r\nis not clearly right and to submit to nothing that is wrong; and I\r\nflatter myself that, supported by the other branches of the Government\r\nand by the intelligence and patriotism of the people, we shall be able,\r\nunder the protection of Providence, to cause all our just rights to be\r\nrespected.\r\n\r\nOf the unsettled matters between the United States and other powers,\r\nthe most prominent are those which have for years been the subject of\r\nnegotiation with England, France, and Spain. The late periods at which\r\nour ministers to those Governments left the United States render it\r\nimpossible at this early day to inform you of what has been done on the\r\nsubjects with which they have been respectively charged. Relying upon\r\nthe justice of our views in relation to the points committed to\r\nnegotiation and the reciprocal good feeling which characterizes our\r\nintercourse with those nations, we have the best reason to hope for a\r\nsatisfactory adjustment of existing differences.\r\n\r\nWith Great Britain, alike distinguished in peace and war, we may look\r\nforward to years of peaceful, honorable, and elevated competition.\r\nEvery thing in the condition and history of the two nations is\r\ncalculated to inspire sentiments of mutual respect and to carry\r\nconviction to the minds of both that it is their policy to preserve the\r\nmost cordial relations. Such are my own views, and it is not to be\r\ndoubted that such are also the prevailing sentiments of our\r\nconstituents. Although neither time nor opportunity has been afforded\r\nfor a full development of the policy which the present cabinet of Great\r\nBritain designs to pursue toward this country, I indulge the hope that\r\nit will be of a just and pacific character; and if this anticipation be\r\nrealized we may look with confidence to a speedy and acceptable\r\nadjustment of our affairs.\r\n\r\nUnder the convention for regulating the reference to arbitration of the\r\ndisputed points of boundary under the 5th article of the treaty of\r\nGhent, the proceedings have hitherto been conducted in that spirit of\r\ncandor and liberality which ought ever to characterize the acts of\r\nsovereign States seeking to adjust by the most unexceptionable means\r\nimportant and delicate subjects of contention. The first sentiments of\r\nthe parties have been exchanged, and the final replication on our part\r\nis in a course of preparation. This subject has received the attention\r\ndemanded by its great and peculiar importance to a patriotic member of\r\nthis Confederacy. The exposition of our rights already made is such as,\r\nfrom the high reputation of the commissioners by whom it has been\r\nprepared, we had a right to expect. Our interests at the Court of the\r\nSovereign who has evinced his friendly disposition by assuming the\r\ndelicate task of arbitration have been committed to a citizen of the\r\nState of Maine, whose character, talents, and intimate acquaintance\r\nwith the subject eminently qualify him for so responsible a trust. With\r\nfull confidence in the justice of our cause and in the probity,\r\nintelligence, and uncompromising independence of the illustrious\r\narbitrator, we can have nothing to apprehend from the result.\r\n\r\nFrom France, our ancient ally, we have a right to expect that justice\r\nwhich becomes the sovereign of a powerful, intelligent, and magnanimous\r\npeople. The beneficial effects produced by the commercial convention of\r\n1822, limited as are its provisions, are too obvious not to make a\r\nsalutary impression upon the minds of those who are charged with the\r\nadministration of her Government. Should this result induce a\r\ndisposition to embrace to their full extent the wholesome principles\r\nwhich constitute our commercial policy, our minister to that Court will\r\nbe found instructed to cherish such a disposition and to aid in\r\nconducting it to useful practical conclusions. The claims of our\r\ncitizens for depredations upon their property, long since committed\r\nunder the authority, and in many instances by the express direction, of\r\nthe then existing Government of France, remain unsatisfied, and must\r\ntherefore continue to furnish a subject of unpleasant discussion and\r\npossible collision between the two Governments. I cherish, however, a\r\nlively hope, founded as well on the validity of those claims and the\r\nestablished policy of all enlightened governments as on the known\r\nintegrity of the French Monarch, that the injurious delays of the past\r\nwill find redress in the equity of the future. Our minister has been\r\ninstructed to press these demands on the French Government with all the\r\nearnestness which is called for by their importance and irrefutable\r\njustice, and in a spirit that will evince the respect which is due to\r\nthe feelings of those from whom the satisfaction is required.\r\n\r\nOur minister recently appointed to Spain has been authorized to assist\r\nin removing evils alike injurious to both countries, either by\r\nconcluding a commercial convention upon liberal and reciprocal terms or\r\nby urging the acceptance in their full extent of the mutually\r\nbeneficial provisions of our navigation acts. He has also been\r\ninstructed to make a further appeal to the justice of Spain, in behalf\r\nof our citizens, for indemnity for spoliations upon our commerce\r\ncommitted under her authority--an appeal which the pacific and liberal\r\ncourse observed on our part and a due confidence in the honor of that\r\nGovernment authorize us to expect will not be made in vain.\r\n\r\nWith other European powers our intercourse is on the most friendly\r\nfooting. In Russia, placed by her territorial limits, extensive\r\npopulation, and great power high in the rank of nations, the United\r\nStates have always found a steadfast friend. Although her recent\r\ninvasion of Turkey awakened a lively sympathy for those who were\r\nexposed to the desolation of war, we can not but anticipate that the\r\nresult will prove favorable to the cause of civilization and to the\r\nprogress of human happiness. The treaty of peace between these powers\r\nhaving been ratified, we can not be insensible to the great benefit to\r\nbe derived by the commerce of the United States from unlocking the\r\nnavigation of the Black Sea, a free passage into which is secured to\r\nall merchant vessels bound to ports of Russia under a flag at peace\r\nwith the Porte. This advantage, enjoyed upon conditions by most of the\r\npowers of Europe, has hitherto been withheld from us. During the past\r\nsummer an antecedent but unsuccessful attempt to obtain it was renewed\r\nunder circumstances which promised the most favorable results. Although\r\nthese results have fortunately been thus in part attained, further\r\nfacilities to the enjoyment of this new field for the enterprise of our\r\ncitizens are, in my opinion, sufficiently desirable to insure to them\r\nour most zealous attention.\r\n\r\nOur trade with Austria, although of secondary importance, has been\r\ngradually increasing, and is now so extended as to deserve the\r\nfostering care of the Government. A negotiation, commenced and nearly\r\ncompleted with that power by the late Administration, has been\r\nconsummated by a treaty of amity, navigation, and commerce, which will\r\nbe laid before the Senate.\r\n\r\nDuring the recess of Congress our diplomatic relations with Portugal\r\nhave been resumed. The peculiar state of things in that country caused\r\na suspension of the recognition of the representative who presented\r\nhimself until an opportunity was had to obtain from our official organ\r\nthere information regarding the actual and, as far as practicable,\r\nprospective condition of the authority by which the representative in\r\nquestion was appointed. This information being received, the\r\napplication of the established rule of our Government in like cases was\r\nno longer withheld.\r\n\r\nConsiderable advances have been made during the present year in the\r\nadjustment of claims of our citizens upon Denmark for spoliations, but\r\nall that we have a right to demand from that Government in their behalf\r\nhas not yet been conceded. From the liberal footing, however, upon\r\nwhich this subject has, with the approbation of the claimants, been\r\nplaced by the Government, together with the uniformly just and friendly\r\ndisposition which has been evinced by His Danish Majesty, there is a\r\nreasonable ground to hope that this single subject of difference will\r\nspeedily be removed.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the Barbary Powers continue, as they have long been,\r\nof the most favorable character. The policy of keeping an adequate\r\nforce in the Mediterranean, as security for the continuance of this\r\ntranquillity, will be persevered in, as well as a similar one for the\r\nprotection of our commerce and fisheries in the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe southern Republics of our own hemisphere have not yet realized all\r\nthe advantages for which they have been so long struggling. We trust,\r\nhowever, that the day is not distant when the restoration of peace and\r\ninternal quiet, under permanent systems of government, securing the\r\nliberty and promoting the happiness of the citizens, will crown with\r\ncomplete success their long and arduous efforts in the cause of\r\nself-government, and enable us to salute them as friendly rivals in all\r\nthat is truly great and glorious.\r\n\r\nThe recent invasion of Mexico, and the effect thereby produced upon her\r\ndomestic policy, must have a controlling influence upon the great\r\nquestion of South American emancipation. We have seen the fell spirit\r\nof civil dissension rebuked, and perhaps for ever stifled, in that\r\nRepublic by the love of independence. If it be true, as appearances\r\nstrongly indicate, the spirit of independence is the master spirit, and\r\nif a corresponding sentiment prevails in the other States, this\r\ndevotion to liberty can not be without a proper effect upon the\r\ncounsels of the mother country. The adoption by Spain of a pacific\r\npolicy toward her former colonies--an event consoling to humanity, and\r\na blessing to the world, in which she herself can not fail largely to\r\nparticipate--may be most reasonably expected.\r\n\r\nThe claims of our citizens upon the South American Governments\r\ngenerally are in a train of settlement, while the principal part of\r\nthose upon Brazil have been adjusted, and a decree in council ordering\r\nbonds to be issued by the minister of the treasury for their amount has\r\nreceived the sanction of His Imperial Majesty. This event, together\r\nwith the exchange of the ratifications of the treaty negotiated and\r\nconcluded in 1828, happily terminates all serious causes of difference\r\nwith that power.\r\n\r\nMeasures have been taken to place our commercial relations with Peru\r\nupon a better footing than that upon which they have hitherto rested,\r\nand if met by a proper disposition on the part of that Government\r\nimportant benefits may be secured to both countries.\r\n\r\nDeeply interested as we are in the prosperity of our sister Republics,\r\nand more particularly in that of our immediate neighbor, it would be\r\nmost gratifying to me were I permitted to say that the treatment which\r\nwe have received at her hands has been as universally friendly as the\r\nearly and constant solicitude manifested by the United States for her\r\nsuccess gave us a right to expect. But it becomes my duty to inform you\r\nthat prejudices long indulged by a portion of the inhabitants of Mexico\r\nagainst the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the\r\nUnited States have had an unfortunate influence upon the affairs of the\r\ntwo countries, and have diminished that usefulness to his own which was\r\njustly to be expected from his talents and zeal. To this cause, in a\r\ngreat degree, is to be imputed the failure of several measures equally\r\ninteresting to both parties, but particularly that of the Mexican\r\nGovernment to ratify a treaty negotiated and concluded in its own\r\ncapital and under its own eye. Under these circumstances it appeared\r\nexpedient to give to Mr. Poinsett the option either to return or not,\r\nas in his judgment the interest of his country might require, and\r\ninstructions to that end were prepared; but before they could be\r\ndispatched a communication was received from the Government of Mexico,\r\nthrough its charge d'affaires here, requesting the recall of our\r\nminister. This was promptly complied with, and a representative of a\r\nrank corresponding with that of the Mexican diplomatic agent near this\r\nGovernment was appointed. Our conduct toward that Republic has been\r\nuniformly of the most friendly character, and having thus removed the\r\nonly alleged obstacle to harmonious intercourse, I can not but hope\r\nthat an advantageous change will occur in our affairs.\r\n\r\nIn justice to Mr. Poinsett it is proper to say that my immediate\r\ncompliance with the application for his recall and the appointment of a\r\nsuccessor are not to be ascribed to any evidence that the imputation of\r\nan improper interference by him in the local politics of Mexico was\r\nwell founded, nor to a want of confidence in his talents or integrity,\r\nand to add that the truth of the charges has never been affirmed by the\r\nfederal Government of Mexico in its communications with us.\r\n\r\nI consider it one of the most urgent of my duties to bring to your\r\nattention the propriety of amending that part of the Constitution which\r\nrelates to the election of President and Vice-President. Our system of\r\ngovernment was by its framers deemed an experiment, and they therefore\r\nconsistently provided a mode of remedying its defects.\r\n\r\nTo the people belongs the right of electing their Chief Magistrate; it\r\nwas never designed that their choice should in any case be defeated,\r\neither by the intervention of electoral colleges or by the agency\r\nconfided, under certain contingencies, to the House of Representatives.\r\nExperience proves that in proportion as agents to execute the will of\r\nthe people are multiplied there is danger of their wishes being\r\nfrustrated. Some may be unfaithful; all are liable to err. So far,\r\ntherefore, as the people can with convenience speak, it is safer for\r\nthem to express their own will.\r\n\r\nThe number of aspirants to the Presidency and the diversity of the\r\ninterests which may influence their claims leave little reason to\r\nexpect a choice in the first instance, and in that event the election\r\nmust devolve on the House of Representatives, where it is obvious the\r\nwill of the people may not be always ascertained, or, if ascertained,\r\nmay not be regarded. From the mode of voting by States the choice is to\r\nbe made by 24 votes, and it may often occur that one of these will be\r\ncontrolled by an individual Representative. Honors and offices are at\r\nthe disposal of the successful candidate. Repeated ballotings may make\r\nit apparent that a single individual holds the cast in his hand. May he\r\nnot be tempted to name his reward?\r\n\r\nBut even without corruption, supposing the probity of the\r\nRepresentative to be proof against the powerful motives by which it may\r\nbe assailed, the will of the people is still constantly liable to be\r\nmisrepresented. One may err from ignorance of the wishes of his\r\nconstituents; another from a conviction that it is his duty to be\r\ngoverned by his own judgment of the fitness of the candidates; finally,\r\nalthough all were inflexibly honest, all accurately informed of the\r\nwishes of their constituents, yet under the present mode of election a\r\nminority may often elect a President, and when this happens it may\r\nreasonably be expected that efforts will be made on the part of the\r\nmajority to rectify this injurious operation of their institutions. But\r\nalthough no evil of this character should result from such a perversion\r\nof the first principle of our system--that the majority is to\r\ngovern--it must be very certain that a President elected by a minority\r\ncan not enjoy the confidence necessary to the successful discharge of\r\nhis duties.\r\n\r\nIn this as in all other matters of public concern policy requires that\r\nas few impediments as possible should exist to the free operation of\r\nthe public will. Let us, then, endeavor so to amend our system that the\r\noffice of Chief Magistrate may not be conferred upon any citizen but in\r\npursuance of a fair expression of the will of the majority.\r\n\r\nI would therefore recommend such an amendment of the Constitution as\r\nmay remove all intermediate agency in the election of the President and\r\nVice-President. The mode may be so regulated as to preserve to each\r\nState its present relative weight in the election, and a failure in the\r\nfirst attempt may be provided for by confining the second to a choice\r\nbetween the two highest candidates. In connection with such an\r\namendment it would seem advisable to limit the service of the Chief\r\nMagistrate to a single term of either four or six years. If, however,\r\nit should not be adopted, it is worthy of consideration whether a\r\nprovision disqualifying for office the Representatives in Congress on\r\nwhom such an election may have devolved would not be proper.\r\n\r\nWhile members of Congress can be constitutionally appointed to offices\r\nof trust and profit it will be the practice, even under the most\r\nconscientious adherence to duty, to select them for such stations as\r\nthey are believed to be better qualified to fill than other citizens;\r\nbut the purity of our Government would doubtless be promoted by their\r\nexclusion from all appointments in the gift of the President, in whose\r\nelection they may have been officially concerned. The nature of the\r\njudicial office and the necessity of securing in the Cabinet and in\r\ndiplomatic stations of the highest rank the best talents and political\r\nexperience should, perhaps, except these from the exclusion.\r\n\r\nThere are, perhaps, few men who can for any great length of time enjoy\r\noffice and power without being more or less under the influence of\r\nfeelings unfavorable to the faithful discharge of their public duties.\r\nTheir integrity may be proof against improper considerations\r\nimmediately addressed to themselves, but they are apt to acquire a\r\nhabit of looking with indifference upon the public interests and of\r\ntolerating conduct from which an unpracticed man would revolt. Office\r\nis considered as a species of property, and government rather as a\r\nmeans of promoting individual interests than as an instrument created\r\nsolely for the service of the people. Corruption in some and in others\r\na perversion of correct feelings and principles divert government from\r\nits legitimate ends and make it an engine for the support of the few at\r\nthe expense of the many. The duties of all public officers are, or at\r\nleast admit of being made, so plain and simple that men of intelligence\r\nmay readily qualify themselves for their performance; and I can not but\r\nbelieve that more is lost by the long continuance of men in office than\r\nis generally to be gained by their experience. I submit, therefore, to\r\nyour consideration whether the efficiency of the Government would not\r\nbe promoted and official industry and integrity better secured by a\r\ngeneral extension of the law which limits appointments to four years.\r\n\r\nIn a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the\r\npeople no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than\r\nanother. Offices were not established to give support to particular men\r\nat the public expense. No individual wrong is, therefore, done by\r\nremoval, since neither appointment to nor continuance in office is a\r\nmatter of right. The incumbent became an officer with a view to public\r\nbenefits, and when these require his removal they are not to be\r\nsacrificed to private interests. It is the people, and they alone, who\r\nhave a right to complain when a bad officer is substituted for a good\r\none. He who is removed has the same means of obtaining a living that\r\nare enjoyed by the millions who never held office. The proposed\r\nlimitation would destroy the idea of property now so generally\r\nconnected with official station, and although individual distress may\r\nbe some times produced, it would, by promoting that rotation which\r\nconstitutes a leading principle in the republican creed, give healthful\r\naction to the system.\r\n\r\nNo very considerable change has occurred during the recess of Congress\r\nin the condition of either our agriculture, commerce, or manufactures.\r\nThe operation of the tariff has not proved so injurious to the two\r\nformer or as beneficial to the latter as was anticipated. Importations\r\nof foreign goods have not been sensibly diminished, while domestic\r\ncompetition, under an illusive excitement, has increased the production\r\nmuch beyond the demand for home consumption. The consequences have been\r\nlow prices, temporary embarrassment, and partial loss. That such of our\r\nmanufacturing establishments as are based upon capital and are\r\nprudently managed will survive the shock and be ultimately profitable\r\nthere is no good reason to doubt.\r\n\r\nTo regulate its conduct so as to promote equally the prosperity of\r\nthese three cardinal interests is one of the most difficult tasks of\r\nGovernment; and it may be regretted that the complicated restrictions\r\nwhich now embarrass the intercourse of nations could not by common\r\nconsent be abolished, and commerce allowed to flow in those channels to\r\nwhich individual enterprise, always its surest guide, might direct it.\r\nBut we must ever expect selfish legislation in other nations, and are\r\ntherefore compelled to adapt our own to their regulations in the manner\r\nbest calculated to avoid serious injury and to harmonize the\r\nconflicting interests of our agriculture, our commerce, and our\r\nmanufactures. Under these impressions I invite your attention to the\r\nexisting tariff, believing that some of its provisions require\r\nmodification.\r\n\r\nThe general rule to be applied in graduating the duties upon articles\r\nof foreign growth or manufacture is that which will place our own in\r\nfair competition with those of other countries; and the inducements to\r\nadvance even a step beyond this point are controlling in regard to\r\nthose articles which are of primary necessity in time of war. When we\r\nreflect upon the difficulty and delicacy of this operation, it is\r\nimportant that it should never be attempted but with the utmost\r\ncaution. Frequent legislation in regard to any branch of industry,\r\naffecting its value, and by which its capital may be transferred to new\r\nchannels, must always be productive of hazardous speculation and loss.\r\n\r\nIn deliberating, therefore, on these interesting subjects local\r\nfeelings and prejudices should be merged in the patriotic determination\r\nto promote the great interests of the whole. All attempts to connect\r\nthem with the party conflicts of the day are necessarily injurious, and\r\nshould be discountenanced. Our action upon them should be under the\r\ncontrol of higher and purer motives. Legislation subjected to such\r\ninfluences can never be just, and will not long retain the sanction of\r\na people whose active patriotism is not bounded by sectional limits nor\r\ninsensible to that spirit of concession and forbearance which gave life\r\nto our political compact and still sustains it. Discarding all\r\ncalculations of political ascendancy, the North, the South, the East,\r\nand the West should unite in diminishing any burthen of which either\r\nmay justly complain.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural interest of our country is so essentially connected\r\nwith every other and so superior in importance to them all that it is\r\nscarcely necessary to invite to it your particular attention. It is\r\nprincipally as manufactures and commerce tend to increase the value of\r\nagricultural productions and to extend their application to the wants\r\nand comforts of society that they deserve the fostering care of\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to the period, not far distant, when a sinking fund\r\nwill no longer be required, the duties on those articles of importation\r\nwhich can not come in competition with our own productions are the\r\nfirst that should engage the attention of Congress in the modification\r\nof the tariff. Of these, tea and coffee are the most important. They\r\nenter largely into the consumption of the country, and have become\r\narticles of necessity to all classes. A reduction, therefore, of the\r\nexisting duties will be felt as a common benefit, but like all other\r\nlegislation connected with commerce, to be efficacious and not\r\ninjurious it should be gradual and certain.\r\n\r\nThe public prosperity is evinced in the increased revenue arising from\r\nthe sales of the public lands and in the steady maintenance of that\r\nproduced by imposts and tonnage, not withstanding the additional duties\r\nimposed by the act of May 19th, 1828, and the unusual importations in\r\nthe early part of that year.\r\n\r\nThe balance in the Treasury on January 1st, 1829 was $5,972,435.81. The\r\nreceipts of the current year are estimated at $24,602,230 and the\r\nexpenditures for the same time at $26,164,595, leaving a balance in the\r\nTreasury on January 1st, 1830 of $4,410,070.81.\r\n\r\nThere will have been paid on account of the public debt during the\r\npresent year the sum of $12,405,005.80, reducing the whole debt of the\r\nGovernment on January 1st, 1830 to $48,565,406.50, including $7 millions\r\nof the 5% stock subscribed to the Bank of the United States. The payment\r\non account of public debt made on July 1st, 1829 was $8,715,462.87. It was\r\napprehended that the sudden withdrawal of so large a sum from the banks\r\nin which it was deposited, at a time of unusual pressure in the money\r\nmarket, might cause much injury to the interests dependent on bank\r\naccommodations. But this evil was wholly averted by an early\r\nanticipation of it at the Treasury, aided by the judicious arrangements\r\nof the officers of the Bank of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis state of the finances exhibits the resources of the nation in an\r\naspect highly flattering to its industry and auspicious of the ability\r\nof Government in a very short time to extinguish the public debt. When\r\nthis shall be done our population will be relieved from a considerable\r\nportion of its present burthens, and will find not only new motives to\r\npatriotic affection, but additional means for the display of individual\r\nenterprise. The fiscal power of the States will also be increased, and\r\nmay be more extensively exerted in favor of education and other public\r\nobjects, while ample means will remain in the Federal Government to\r\npromote the general weal in all the modes permitted to its authority.\r\n\r\nAfter the extinction of the public debt it is not probable that any\r\nadjustment of the tariff upon principles satisfactory to the people of\r\nthe Union will until a remote period, if ever, leave the Government\r\nwithout a considerable surplus in the Treasury beyond what may be\r\nrequired for its current service. As, then, the period approaches when\r\nthe application of the revenue to the payment of debt will cease, the\r\ndisposition of the surplus will present a subject for the serious\r\ndeliberation of Congress; and it may be fortunate for the country that\r\nit is yet to be decided.\r\n\r\nConsidered in connection with the difficulties which have heretofore\r\nattended appropriations for purposes of internal improvement, and with\r\nthose which this experience tells us will certainly arise when ever\r\npower over such subjects may be exercised by the Central Government, it\r\nis hoped that it may lead to the adoption of some plan which will\r\nreconcile the diversified interests of the States and strengthen the\r\nbonds which unite them. Every member of the Union, in peace and in war,\r\nwill be benefited by the improvement of inland navigation and the\r\nconstruction of high ways in the several States. Let us, then, endeavor\r\nto attain this benefit in a mode which will be satisfactory to all.\r\nThat hitherto adopted has by many of our fellow citizens been\r\ndeprecated as an infraction of the Constitution, while by others it has\r\nbeen viewed as inexpedient. All feel that it has been employed at the\r\nexpense of harmony in the legislative councils.\r\n\r\nTo avoid these evils it appears to me that the most safe, just, and\r\nfederal disposition which could be made of the surplus revenue would be\r\nits apportionment among the several States according to their ratio of\r\nrepresentation, and should this measure not be found warranted by the\r\nConstitution that it would be expedient to propose to the States an\r\namendment authorizing it. I regard an appeal to the source of power in\r\ncases of real doubt, and where its exercise is deemed indispensable to\r\nthe general welfare, as among the most sacred of all our obligations.\r\n\r\nUpon this country more than any other has, in the providence of God,\r\nbeen cast the special guardianship of the great principle of adherence\r\nto written constitutions. If it fail here, all hope in regard to it\r\nwill be extinguished.\r\n\r\nThat this was intended to be a government of limited and specific, and\r\nnot general, powers must be admitted by all, and it is our duty to\r\npreserve for it the character intended by its framers. If experience\r\npoints out the necessity for an enlargement of these powers, let us\r\napply for it to those for whose benefit it is to be exercised, and not\r\nunder-mine the whole system by a resort to over-strained constructions.\r\nThe scheme has worked well. It has exceeded the hopes of those who\r\ndevised it, and become an object of admiration to the world. We are\r\nresponsible to our country and to the glorious cause of self-government\r\nfor the preservation of so great a good.\r\n\r\nThe great mass of legislation relating to our internal affairs was\r\nintended to be left where the Federal Convention found it--in the State\r\ngovernments. Nothing is clearer, in my view, than that we are chiefly\r\nindebted for the success of the Constitution under which we are now\r\nacting to the watchful and auxiliary operation of the State\r\nauthorities. This is not the reflection of a day, but belongs to the\r\nmost deeply rooted convictions of my mind. I can not, therefore, too\r\nstrongly or too earnestly, for my own sense of its importance, warn you\r\nagainst all encroachments upon the legitimate sphere of State\r\nsovereignty. Sustained by its healthful and invigorating influence the\r\nfederal system can never fall.\r\n\r\nIn the collection of the revenue the long credits authorized on goods\r\nimported from beyond the Cape of Good Hope are the chief cause of the\r\nlosses at present sustained. If these were shortened to 6, 9, and 12\r\nmonths, and ware-houses provided by Government sufficient to receive\r\nthe goods offered in deposit for security and for debenture, and if the\r\nright of the United States to a priority of payment out of the estates\r\nof its insolvent debtors were more effectually secured, this evil would\r\nin a great measure be obviated. An authority to construct such houses\r\nis therefore, with the proposed alteration of the credits, recommended\r\nto your attention.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice that the laws for the collection and security of\r\nthe revenue arising from imposts were chiefly framed when the rates of\r\nduties on imported goods presented much less temptation for illicit\r\ntrade than at present exists. There is reason to believe that these\r\nlaws are in some respects quite insufficient for the proper security of\r\nthe revenue and the protection of the interests of those who are\r\ndisposed to observe them. The injurious and demoralizing tendency of a\r\nsuccessful system of smuggling is so obvious as not to require comment,\r\nand can not be too carefully guarded against. I therefore suggest to\r\nCongress the propriety of adopting efficient measures to prevent this\r\nevil, avoiding, however, as much as possible, every unnecessary\r\ninfringement of individual liberty and embarrassment of fair and lawful\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nOn an examination of the records of the Treasury I have been forcibly\r\nstruck with the large amount of public money which appears to be\r\noutstanding. Of the sum thus due from individuals to the Government a\r\nconsiderable portion is undoubtedly desperate, and in many instances\r\nhas probably been rendered so by remissness in the agents charged with\r\nits collection. By proper exertions a great part, however, may yet be\r\nrecovered; and what ever may be the portions respectively belonging to\r\nthese two classes, it behooves the Government to ascertain the real\r\nstate of the fact. This can be done only by the prompt adoption of\r\njudicious measures for the collection of such as may be made available.\r\nIt is believed that a very large amount has been lost through the\r\ninadequacy of the means provided for the collection of debts due to the\r\npublic, and that this inadequacy lies chiefly in the want of legal\r\nskill habitually and constantly employed in the direction of the agents\r\nengaged in the service. It must, I think, be admitted that the\r\nsupervisory power over suits brought by the public, which is now vested\r\nin an accounting officer of the Treasury, not selected with a view to\r\nhis legal knowledge, and encumbered as he is with numerous other\r\nduties, operates unfavorably to the public interest.\r\n\r\nIt is important that this branch of the public service should be\r\nsubjected to the supervision of such professional skill as will give it\r\nefficiency. The expense attendant upon such a modification of the\r\nexecutive department would be justified by the soundest principles of\r\neconomy. I would recommend, therefore, that the duties now assigned to\r\nthe agent of the Treasury, so far as they relate to the superintendence\r\nand management of legal proceedings on the part of the United States,\r\nbe transferred to the Attorney General, and that this officer be placed\r\non the same footing in all respects as the heads of the other\r\nDepartments, receiving like compensation and having such subordinate\r\nofficers provided for his Department as may be requisite for the\r\ndischarge of these additional duties. The professional skill of the\r\nAttorney General, employed in directing the conduct of marshals and\r\ndistrict attorneys, would hasten the collection of debts now in suit\r\nand hereafter save much to the Government. It might be further extended\r\nto the superintendence of all criminal proceedings for offenses against\r\nthe United States. In making this transfer great care should be taken,\r\nhowever, that the power necessary to the Treasury Department be not\r\nimpaired, one of its greatest securities consisting in control over all\r\naccounts until they are audited or reported for suit.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the foregoing views I would suggest also an inquiry\r\nwhether the provisions of the act of Congress authorizing the discharge\r\nof the persons of the debtors to the Government from imprisonment may\r\nnot, consistently with the public interest, be extended to the release\r\nof the debt where the conduct of the debtor is wholly exempt from the\r\nimputation of fraud. Some more liberal policy than that which now\r\nprevails in reference to this unfortunate class of citizens is\r\ncertainly due to them, and would prove beneficial to the country. The\r\ncontinuance of the liability after the means to discharge it have been\r\nexhausted can only serve to dispirit the debtor; or, where his\r\nresources are but partial, the want of power in the Government to\r\ncompromise and release the demand instigates to fraud as the only\r\nresource for securing a support to his family. He thus sinks into a\r\nstate of apathy, and becomes a useless drone in society or a vicious\r\nmember of it, if not a feeling witness of the rigor and inhumanity of\r\nhis country. All experience proves that oppressive debt is the bane of\r\nenterprise, and it should be the care of a republic not to exert a\r\ngrinding power over misfortune and poverty.\r\n\r\nSince the last session of Congress numerous frauds on the Treasury have\r\nbeen discovered, which I thought it my duty to bring under the\r\ncognizance of the United States court for this district by a criminal\r\nprosecution. It was my opinion and that of able counsel who were\r\nconsulted that the cases came within the penalties of the act of the\r\n17th Congress approved March 3d, 1823, providing for punishment of\r\nfrauds committed on the Government of the United States. Either from\r\nsome defect in the law or in its administration every effort to bring\r\nthe accused to trial under its provisions proved ineffectual, and the\r\nGovernment was driven to the necessity of resorting to the vague and\r\ninadequate provisions of the common law. It is therefore my duty to\r\ncall your attention to the laws which have been passed for the\r\nprotection of the Treasury. If, indeed, there be no provision by which\r\nthose who may be unworthily intrusted with its guardianship can be\r\npunished for the most flagrant violation of duty, extending even to the\r\nmost fraudulent appropriation of the public funds to their own use, it\r\nis time to remedy so dangerous an omission; or if the law has been\r\nperverted from its original purposes, and criminals deserving to be\r\npunished under its provisions have been rescued by legal subtleties, it\r\nought to be made so plain by amendatory provisions as to baffle the\r\narts of perversion and accomplish the ends of its original enactment.\r\n\r\nIn one of the most flagrant causes the court decided that the\r\nprosecution was barred by the statute which limits prosecutions for\r\nfraud to two years. In this case all the evidences of the fraud, and,\r\nindeed, all knowledge that a fraud had been committed, were in\r\npossession of the party accused until after the two years had elapsed.\r\nSurely the statute ought not to run in favor of any man while he\r\nretains all the evidences of his crime in his own possession, and least\r\nof all in favor of a public officer who continues to defraud the\r\nTreasury and conceal the transaction for the brief term of two years. I\r\nwould therefore recommend such an alteration of the law as will give\r\nthe injured party and the Government two years after the disclosure of\r\nthe fraud or after the accused is out of office to commence their\r\nprosecution.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject I invite the attention of Congress to a\r\ngeneral and minute inquiry into the condition of the Government, with a\r\nview to ascertain what offices can be dispensed with, what expenses\r\nretrenched, and what improvements may be made in the organization of\r\nits various parts to secure the proper responsibility of public agents\r\nand promote efficiency and justice in all its operations.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War will make you acquainted with the\r\ncondition of our Army, fortifications, arsenals, and Indian affairs.\r\nThe proper discipline of the Army, the training and equipment of the\r\nmilitia, the education bestowed at West Point, and the accumulation of\r\nthe means of defense applicable to the naval force will tend to prolong\r\nthe peace we now enjoy, and which every good citizen, more especially\r\nthose who have felt the miseries of even a successful warfare, must\r\nardently desire to perpetuate.\r\n\r\nThe returns from the subordinate branches of this service exhibit a\r\nregularity and order highly creditable to its character. Both officers\r\nand soldiers seem imbued with a proper sense of duty, and conform to\r\nthe restraints of exact discipline with that cheerfulness which becomes\r\nthe profession of arms. There is need, however, of further legislation\r\nto obviate the inconveniences specified in the report under\r\nconsideration, to some of which it is proper that I should call your\r\nparticular attention.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress of March 2d, 1821, to reduce and fix the military\r\nestablishment, remaining unexecuted as it regards the command of one of\r\nthe regiments of artillery, can not now be deemed a guide to the\r\nExecutive in making the proper appointment. An explanatory act,\r\ndesignating the class of officers out of which the grade is to be\r\nfilled--whether from the military list as existing prior to the act of\r\n1821 or from it as it has been fixed by that act--would remove this\r\ndifficulty. It is also important that the laws regulating the pay and\r\nemoluments of officers generally should be more specific than they now\r\nare. Those, for example, in relation to the Pay Master and Surgeon\r\nGeneral assign to them an annual salary of $2.500, but are silent as to\r\nallowances which in certain exigencies of the service may be deemed\r\nindispensable to the discharge of their duties. This circumstance has\r\nbeen the authority for extending to them various allowances at\r\ndifferent times under former Administrations, but no uniform rule has\r\nbeen observed on the subject. Similar inconveniences exist in other\r\ncases, in which the construction put upon the laws by the public\r\naccountants may operate unequally, produce confusion, and expose\r\nofficers to the odium of claiming what is not their due.\r\n\r\nI recommend to your fostering care, as one of our safest means of\r\nnational defense, the Military Academy. This institution has already\r\nexercised the happiest influence upon the moral and intellectual\r\ncharacter of our Army; and such of the graduates as from various causes\r\nmay not pursue the profession of arms will be scarcely less useful as\r\ncitizens. Their knowledge of the military art will be advantageously\r\nemployed in the militia service, and in a measure secure to that class\r\nof troops the advantages which in this respect belong to standing\r\narmies.\r\n\r\nI would also suggest a review of the pension law, for the purpose of\r\nextending its benefits to every Revolutionary soldier who aided in\r\nestablishing our liberties, and who is unable to maintain himself in\r\ncomfort. These relics of the War of Independence have strong claims\r\nupon their country's gratitude and bounty. The law is defective in not\r\nembracing within its provisions all those who were during the last war\r\ndisabled from supporting themselves by manual labor. Such an amendment\r\nwould add but little to the amount of pensions, and is called for by\r\nthe sympathies of the people as well as by considerations of sound\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that a large addition to the list of pensioners\r\nhas been occasioned by an order of the late Administration, departing\r\nmaterially from the rules which had previously prevailed. Considering\r\nit an act of legislation, I suspended its operation as soon as I was\r\ninformed that it had commenced. Before this period, however,\r\napplications under the new regulation had been preferred to the number\r\nof 154, of which, on March 27, the date of its revocation, 87 were\r\nadmitted. For the amount there was neither estimate nor appropriation;\r\nand besides this deficiency, the regular allowances, according to the\r\nrules which have heretofore governed the Department, exceed the\r\nestimate of its late Secretary by about $50,000, for which an\r\nappropriation is asked.\r\n\r\nYour particular attention is requested to that part of the report of\r\nthe Secretary of War which relates to the money held in trust for the\r\nSeneca tribe of Indians. It will be perceived that without legislative\r\naid the Executive can not obviate the embarrassments occasioned by the\r\ndiminution of the dividends on that fund, which originally amounted to\r\n$100,000, and has recently been invested in United States 3% stock.\r\n\r\nThe condition and ulterior destiny of the Indian tribes within the\r\nlimits of some of our States have become objects of much interest and\r\nimportance. It has long been the policy of Government to introduce\r\namong them the arts of civilization, in the hope of gradually\r\nreclaiming them from a wandering life. This policy has, however, been\r\ncoupled with another wholly incompatible with its success. Professing a\r\ndesire to civilize and settle them, we have at the same time lost no\r\nopportunity to purchase their lands and thrust them farther into the\r\nwilderness. By this means they have not only been kept in a wandering\r\nstate, but been led to look upon us as unjust and indifferent to their\r\nfate. Thus, though lavish in its expenditures upon the subject,\r\nGovernment has constantly defeated its own policy, and the Indians in\r\ngeneral, receding farther and farther to the west, have retained their\r\nsavage habits. A portion, however, of the Southern tribes, having\r\nmingled much with the whites and made some progress in the arts of\r\ncivilized life, have lately attempted to erect an independent\r\ngovernment within the limits of Georgia and Alabama. These States,\r\nclaiming to be the only sovereigns within their territories, extended\r\ntheir laws over the Indians, which induced the latter to call upon the\r\nUnited States for protection.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the question presented was whether the\r\nGeneral Government had a right to sustain those people in their\r\npretensions. The Constitution declares that \"no new State shall be\r\nformed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other State\" without\r\nthe consent of its legislature. If the General Government is not\r\npermitted to tolerate the erection of a confederate State within the\r\nterritory of one of the members of this Union against her consent, much\r\nless could it allow a foreign and independent government to establish\r\nitself there.\r\n\r\nGeorgia became a member of the Confederacy which eventuated in our\r\nFederal Union as a sovereign State, always asserting her claim to\r\ncertain limits, which, having been originally defined in her colonial\r\ncharter and subsequently recognized in the treaty of peace, she has\r\never since continued to enjoy, except as they have been circumscribed\r\nby her own voluntary transfer of a portion of her territory to the\r\nUnited States in the articles of cession of 1802. Alabama was admitted\r\ninto the Union on the same footing with the original States, with\r\nboundaries which were prescribed by Congress.\r\n\r\nThere is no constitutional, conventional, or legal provision which\r\nallows them less power over the Indians within their borders than is\r\npossessed by Maine or New York. Would the people of Maine permit the\r\nPenobscot tribe to erect an independent government within their State?\r\nAnd unless they did would it not be the duty of the General Government\r\nto support them in resisting such a measure? Would the people of New\r\nYork permit each remnant of the six Nations within her borders to\r\ndeclare itself an independent people under the protection of the United\r\nStates? Could the Indians establish a separate republic on each of\r\ntheir reservations in Ohio? And if they were so disposed would it be\r\nthe duty of this Government to protect them in the attempt? If the\r\nprinciple involved in the obvious answer to these questions be\r\nabandoned, it will follow that the objects of this Government are\r\nreversed, and that it has become a part of its duty to aid in\r\ndestroying the States which it was established to protect.\r\n\r\nActuated by this view of the subject, I informed the Indians inhabiting\r\nparts of Georgia and Alabama that their attempt to establish an\r\nindependent government would not be countenanced by the Executive of\r\nthe United States, and advised them to emigrate beyond the Mississippi\r\nor submit to the laws of those States.\r\n\r\nOur conduct toward these people is deeply interesting to our national\r\ncharacter. Their present condition, contrasted with what they once\r\nwere, makes a most powerful appeal to our sympathies. Our ancestors\r\nfound them the uncontrolled possessors of these vast regions. By\r\npersuasion and force they have been made to retire from river to river\r\nand from mountain to mountain, until some of the tribes have become\r\nextinct and others have left but remnants to preserve for a while their\r\nonce terrible names. Surrounded by the whites with their arts of\r\ncivilization, which by destroying the resources of the savage doom him\r\nto weakness and decay, the fate of the Mohegan, the Narragansett, and\r\nthe Delaware is fast over-taking the Choctaw, the Cherokee, and the\r\nCreek. That this fate surely awaits them if they remain within the\r\nlimits of the States does not admit of a doubt. Humanity and national\r\nhonor demand that every effort should be made to avert so great a\r\ncalamity. It is too late to inquire whether it was just in the United\r\nStates to include them and their territory within the bounds of new\r\nStates, whose limits they could control. That step can not be retraced.\r\nA State can not be dismembered by Congress or restricted in the\r\nexercise of her constitutional power. But the people of those States\r\nand of every State, actuated by feelings of justice and a regard for\r\nour national honor, submit to you the interesting question whether\r\nsomething can not be done, consistently with the rights of the States,\r\nto preserve this much-injured race.  As a means of effecting this end I\r\nsuggest for your consideration the propriety of setting apart an ample\r\ndistrict west of the Mississippi, and without the limits of any State\r\nor Territory now formed, to be guaranteed to the Indian tribes as long\r\nas they shall occupy it, each tribe having a distinct control over the\r\nportion designated for its use. There they may be secured in the\r\nenjoyment of governments of their own choice, subject to no other\r\ncontrol from the United States than such as may be necessary to\r\npreserve peace on the frontier and between the several tribes. There\r\nthe benevolent may endeavor to teach them the arts of civilization,\r\nand, by promoting union and harmony among them, to raise up an\r\ninteresting commonwealth, destined to perpetuate the race and to attest\r\nthe humanity and justice of this Government.\r\n\r\nThis emigration should be voluntary, for it would be as cruel as unjust\r\nto compel the aborigines to abandon the graves of their fathers and\r\nseek a home in a distant land. But they should be distinctly informed\r\nthat if they remain within the limits of the States they must be\r\nsubject to their laws. In return for their obedience as individuals\r\nthey will without doubt be protected in the enjoyment of those\r\npossessions which they have improved by their industry. But it seems to\r\nme visionary to suppose that in this state of things claims can be\r\nallowed on tracts of country on which they have neither dwelt nor made\r\nimprovements, merely because they have seen them from the mountain or\r\npassed them in the chase. Submitting to the laws of the States, and\r\nreceiving, like other citizens, protection in their persons and\r\nproperty, they will ere long become merged in the mass of our\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy will make you\r\nacquainted with the condition and useful employment of that branch of\r\nour service during the present year. Constituting as it does the best\r\nstanding security of this country against foreign aggression, it claims\r\nthe especial attention of Government. In this spirit the measures which\r\nsince the termination of the last war have been in operation for its\r\ngradual enlargement were adopted, and it should continue to be\r\ncherished as the off-spring of our national experience. It will be\r\nseen, however, that not withstanding the great solicitude which has\r\nbeen manifested for the perfect organization of this arm and the\r\nliberality of the appropriations which that solicitude has suggested,\r\nthis object has in many important respects not been secured.\r\n\r\nIn time of peace we have need of no more ships of war than are\r\nrequisite to the protection of our commerce. Those not wanted for this\r\nobject must lay in the harbors, where without proper covering they\r\nrapidly decay, and even under the best precautions for their\r\npreservation must soon become useless. Such is already the case with\r\nmany of our finest vessels, which, though unfinished, will now require\r\nimmense sums of money to be restored to the condition in which they\r\nwere when committed to their proper element.\r\n\r\nOn this subject there can be but little doubt that our best policy\r\nwould be to discontinue the building of ships of the first and second\r\nclass, and look rather to the possession of ample materials, prepared\r\nfor the emergencies of war, than to the number of vessels which we can\r\nfloat in a season of peace, as the index of our naval power. Judicious\r\ndeposits in navy yards of timber and other materials, fashioned under\r\nthe hands of skillful work-men and fitted for prompt application to\r\ntheir various purposes, would enable us at all times to construct\r\nvessels as fast as they can be manned, and save the heavy expense of\r\nrepairs, except to such vessels as must be employed in guarding our\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nThe proper points for the establishment of these yards are indicated\r\nwith so much force in the report of the Navy Board that in recommending\r\nit to your attention I deem it unnecessary to do more than express my\r\nhearty concurrence in their views. The yard in this District, being\r\nalready furnished with most of the machinery necessary for ship\r\nbuilding, will be competent to the supply of the two selected by the\r\nBoard as the best for the concentration of materials, and, from the\r\nfacility and certainty of communication between them, it will be\r\nuseless to incur at those depots the expense of similar machinery,\r\nespecially that used in preparing the usual metallic and wooden\r\nfurniture of vessels.\r\n\r\nAnother improvement would be effected by dispensing altogether with the\r\nNavy Board as now constituted, and substituting in its stead bureaux\r\nsimilar to those already existing in the War Department. Each member of\r\nthe Board, transferred to the head of a separate bureau charged with\r\nspecific duties, would feel in its highest degree that wholesome\r\nresponsibility which can not be divided without a far more than\r\nproportionate diminution of its force. Their valuable services would\r\nbecome still more so when separately appropriated to distinct portions\r\nof the great interests of the Navy, to the prosperity of which each\r\nwould be impelled to devote himself by the strongest motives. Under\r\nsuch an arrangement every branch of this important service would assume\r\na more simple and precise character, its efficiency would be increased,\r\nand scrupulous economy in the expenditure of public money promoted.\r\n\r\nI would also recommend that the Marine Corps be merged in the artillery\r\nor infantry, as the best mode of curing the many defects in its\r\norganization. But little exceeding in number any of the regiments of\r\ninfantry, that corps has, besides its lieutenant-colonel commandant,\r\nfive brevet lieutenant-colonels, who receive the full pay and\r\nemoluments of their brevet rank, without rendering proportionate\r\nservice. Details for marine service could as well be made from the\r\nartillery or infantry, there being no peculiar training requisite for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWith these improvements, and such others as zealous watchfulness and\r\nmature consideration may suggest, there can be little doubt that under\r\nan energetic administration of its affairs the Navy may soon be made\r\nevery thing that the nation wishes it to be. Its efficiency in the\r\nsuppression of piracy in the West India seas, and wherever its\r\nsquadrons have been employed in securing the interests of the country,\r\nwill appear from the report of the Secretary, to which I refer you for\r\nother interesting details. Among these I would bespeak the attention of\r\nCongress for the views presented in relation to the inequality between\r\nthe Army and Navy as to the pay of officers. No such inequality should\r\nprevail between these brave defenders of their country, and where it\r\ndoes exist it is submitted to Congress whether it ought not to be\r\nrectified.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Post Master General is referred to as exhibiting a\r\nhighly satisfactory administration of that Department. Abuses have been\r\nreformed, increased expedition in the transportation of the mail\r\nsecured, and its revenue much improved. In a political point of view\r\nthis Department is chiefly important as affording the means of\r\ndiffusing knowledge. It is to the body politic what the veins and\r\narteries are to the natural--conveying rapidly and regularly to the\r\nremotest parts of the system correct information of the operations of\r\nthe Government, and bringing back to it the wishes and feelings of the\r\npeople. Through its agency we have secured to ourselves the full\r\nenjoyment of the blessings of a free press.\r\n\r\nIn this general survey of our affairs a subject of high importance\r\npresents itself in the present organization of the judiciary. An\r\nuniform operation of the Federal Government in the different States is\r\ncertainly desirable, and existing as they do in the Union on the basis\r\nof perfect equality, each State has a right to expect that the benefits\r\nconferred on the citizens of others should be extended to hers. The\r\njudicial system of the United States exists in all its efficiency in\r\nonly fifteen members of the Union; to three others the circuit courts,\r\nwhich constitute an important part of that system, have been\r\nimperfectly extended, and to the remaining six altogether denied. The\r\neffect has been to withhold from the inhabitants of the latter the\r\nadvantages afforded (by the Supreme Court) to their fellow citizens in\r\nother States in the whole extent of the criminal and much of the civil\r\nauthority of the Federal judiciary. That this state of things ought to\r\nbe remedied, if it can be done consistently with the public welfare, is\r\nnot to be doubted. Neither is it to be disguised that the organization\r\nof our judicial system is at once a difficult and delicate task. To\r\nextend the circuit courts equally throughout the different parts of the\r\nUnion, and at the same time to avoid such a multiplication of members\r\nas would encumber the supreme appellate tribunal, is the object\r\ndesired. Perhaps it might be accomplished by dividing the circuit\r\njudges into two classes, and providing that the Supreme Court should be\r\nheld by these classes alternately, the Chief Justice always presiding.\r\n\r\nIf an extension of the circuit court system to those States which do\r\nnot now enjoy its benefits should be determined upon, it would of\r\ncourse be necessary to revise the present arrangement of the circuits;\r\nand even if that system should not be enlarged, such a revision is\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nA provision for taking the census of the people of the United States\r\nwill, to insure the completion of that work within a convenient time,\r\nclaim the early attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe great and constant increase of business in the Department of State\r\nforced itself at an early period upon the attention of the Executive.\r\nThirteen years ago it was, in Mr. Madison's last message to Congress,\r\nmade the subject of an earnest recommendation, which has been repeated\r\nby both of his successors; and my comparatively limited experience has\r\nsatisfied me of its justness. It has arisen from many causes, not the\r\nleast of which is the large addition that has been made to the family\r\nof independent nations and the proportionate extension of our foreign\r\nrelations. The remedy proposed was the establishment of a home\r\ndepartment--a measure which does not appear to have met the views of\r\nCongress on account of its supposed tendency to increase, gradually and\r\nimperceptibly, the already too strong bias of the federal system toward\r\nthe exercise of authority not delegated to it. I am not, therefore,\r\ndisposed to revive the recommendation, but am not the less impressed\r\nwith the importance of so organizing that Department that its Secretary\r\nmay devote more of his time to our foreign relations. Clearly satisfied\r\nthat the public good would be promoted by some suitable provision on\r\nthe subject, I respectfully invite your attention to it.\r\n\r\nThe charter of the Bank of the United States expires in 1836, and its\r\nstock holders will most probably apply for a renewal of their\r\nprivileges. In order to avoid the evils resulting from precipitancy in\r\na measure involving such important principles and such deep pecuniary\r\ninterests, I feel that I can not, in justice to the parties interested,\r\ntoo soon present it to the deliberate consideration of the Legislature\r\nand the people. Both the constitutionality and the expediency of the\r\nlaw creating this bank are well questioned by a large portion of our\r\nfellow citizens, and it must be admitted by all that it has failed in\r\nthe great end of establishing an uniform and sound currency.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, if such an institution is deemed essential\r\nto the fiscal operations of the Government, I submit to the wisdom of\r\nthe Legislature whether a national one, founded upon the credit of the\r\nGovernment and its revenues, might not be devised which would avoid all\r\nconstitutional difficulties and at the same time secure all the\r\nadvantages to the Government and country that were expected to result\r\nfrom the present bank.\r\n\r\nI can not close this communication without bringing to your view the\r\njust claim of the representatives of Commodore Decatur, his officers\r\nand crew, arising from the recapture of the frigate Philadelphia under\r\nthe heavy batteries of Tripoli. Although sensible, as a general rule,\r\nof the impropriety of Executive interference under a Government like\r\nours, where every individual enjoys the right of directly petitioning\r\nCongress, yet, viewing this case as one of very peculiar character, I\r\ndeem it my duty to recommend it to your favorable consideration.\r\nBesides the justice of this claim, as corresponding to those which have\r\nbeen since recognized and satisfied, it is the fruit of a deed of\r\npatriotic and chivalrous daring which infused life and confidence into\r\nour infant Navy and contributed as much as any exploit in its history\r\nto elevate our national character. Public gratitude, therefore, stamps\r\nher seal upon it, and the meed should not be withheld which may here\r\nafter operate as a stimulus to our gallant tars.\r\n\r\nI now commend you, fellow citizens, to the guidance of Almighty God,\r\nwith a full reliance on His merciful providence for the maintenance of\r\nour free institutions, and with an earnest supplication that what ever\r\nerrors it may be my lot to commit in discharging the arduous duties\r\nwhich have devolved on me will find a remedy in the harmony and wisdom\r\nof your counsels.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nAndrew Jackson\r\nDecember 6, 1830\r\n\r\nFellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe pleasure I have in congratulating you upon your return to your\r\nconstitutional duties is much heightened by the satisfaction which the\r\ncondition of our beloved country at this period justly inspires. The\r\nbeneficent Author of All Good has granted to us during the present year\r\nhealth, peace, and plenty, and numerous causes for joy in the wonderful\r\nsuccess which attends the progress of our free institutions.\r\n\r\nWith a population unparalleled in its increase, and possessing a\r\ncharacter which combines the hardihood of enterprise with the\r\nconsiderateness of wisdom, we see in every section of our happy country\r\na steady improvement in the means of social intercourse, and\r\ncorrespondent effects upon the genius and laws of our extended\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nThe apparent exceptions to the harmony of the prospect are to be\r\nreferred rather to inevitable diversities in the various interests\r\nwhich enter into the composition of so extensive a whole than any want\r\nof attachment to the Union--interests whose collisions serve only in\r\nthe end to foster the spirit of conciliation and patriotism so\r\nessential to the preservation of that Union which I most devoutly hope\r\nis destined to prove imperishable.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these blessings we have recently witnessed changes in\r\nthe conditions of other nations which may in their consequences call\r\nfor the utmost vigilance, wisdom, and unanimity in our councils, and\r\nthe exercise of all the moderation and patriotism of our people.\r\n\r\nThe important modifications of their Government, effected with so much\r\ncourage and wisdom by the people of France, afford a happy presage of\r\ntheir future course, and have naturally elicited from the kindred\r\nfeelings of this nation that spontaneous and universal burst of\r\napplause in which you have participated. In congratulating you, my\r\nfellow citizens, upon an event so auspicious to the dearest interests\r\nof man-kind I do no more than respond to the voice of my country,\r\nwithout transcending in the slightest degree that salutary maxim of the\r\nillustrious Washington which enjoins an abstinence from all\r\ninterference with the internal affairs of other nations. From a people\r\nexercising in the most unlimited degree the right of self-government,\r\nand enjoying, as derived from this proud characteristic, under the\r\nfavor of Heaven, much of the happiness with which they are blessed; a\r\npeople who can point in triumph to their free institutions and\r\nchallenge comparison with the fruits they bear, as well as with the\r\nmoderation, intelligence, and energy with which they are administered--\r\nfrom such a people the deepest sympathy was to be expected in a\r\nstruggle for the sacred principles of liberty, conducted in a spirit\r\nevery way worthy of the cause, and crowned by a heroic moderation which\r\nhas disarmed revolution of its terrors. Not withstanding the strong\r\nassurances which the man whom we so sincerely love and justly admire\r\nhas given to the world of the high character of the present King of the\r\nFrench, and which if sustained to the end will secure to him the proud\r\nappellation of Patriot King, it is not in his success, but in that of\r\nthe great principle which has borne him to the throne--the paramount\r\nauthority of the public will--that the American people rejoice.\r\n\r\nI am happy to inform you that the anticipations which were indulged at\r\nthe date of my last communication on the subject of our foreign affairs\r\nhave been fully realized in several important particulars.\r\n\r\nAn arrangement has been effected with Great Britain in relation to the\r\ntrade between the United States and her West India and North American\r\ncolonies which has settled a question that has for years afforded\r\nmatter for contention and almost uninterrupted discussion, and has been\r\nthe subject of no less than six negotiations, in a manner which\r\npromises results highly favorable to the parties.\r\n\r\nThe abstract right of Great Britain to monopolize the trade with her\r\ncolonies or to exclude us from a participation therein has never been\r\ndenied by the United States. But we have contended, and with reason,\r\nthat if at any time Great Britain may desire the productions of this\r\ncountry as necessary to her colonies they must be received upon\r\nprinciples of just reciprocity, and, further, that it is making an\r\ninvidious and unfriendly distinction to open her colonial ports to the\r\nvessels of other nations and close them against those of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nAntecedently to 1794 a portion of our productions was admitted into the\r\ncolonial islands of Great Britain by particular concessions, limited to\r\nthe term of one year, but renewed from year to year. In the\r\ntransportation of these productions, however, our vessels were not\r\nallowed to engage, this being a privilege reserved to British shipping,\r\nby which alone our produce could be taken to the islands and theirs\r\nbrought to us in return. From Newfoundland and her continental\r\npossessions all our productions, as well as our vessels, were excluded,\r\nwith occasional relaxations, by which, in seasons of distress, the\r\nformer were admitted in British bottoms.\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of 1794 she offered to concede to us for a limited time\r\nthe right of carrying to her West India possessions in our vessels not\r\nexceeding 70 tons burthen, and upon the same terms as British vessels,\r\nany productions of the United States which British vessels might import\r\ntherefrom. But this privilege was coupled with conditions which are\r\nsupposed to have led to its rejection by the Senate; that is, that\r\nAmerican vessels should land their return cargoes in the United States\r\nonly, and, moreover, that they should during the continuance of the\r\nprivilege be precluded from carrying molasses, sugar, coffee, cocoa, or\r\ncotton either from those islands or from the United States to any other\r\npart of the world. Great Britain readily consented to expunge this\r\narticle from the treaty, and subsequent attempts to arrange the terms\r\nof the trade either by treaty stipulations or concerted legislation\r\nhave failed, it has been successively suspended and allowed according\r\nto the varying legislation of the parties.\r\n\r\nThe following are the prominent points which have in later years\r\nseparated the two Governments: Besides a restriction whereby all\r\nimportations into her colonies in American vessels are confined to our\r\nown products carried hence, a restriction to which it does not appear\r\nthat we have ever objected, a leading object on the part of Great\r\nBritain has been to prevent us from becoming the carriers of British\r\nWest India commodities to any other country than our own. On the part\r\nof the United States it has been contended, first, that the subject\r\nshould be regulated by treaty stipulation in preference to separate\r\nlegislation; second, that our productions, when imported into the\r\ncolonies in question, should not be subject to higher duties than the\r\nproductions of the mother country or of her other colonial possessions,\r\nand, 3rd, that our vessels should be allowed to participate in the\r\ncircuitous trade between the United States and different parts of the\r\nBritish dominions.\r\n\r\nThe first point, after having been for a long time strenuously insisted\r\nupon by Great Britain, was given up by the act of Parliament of July,\r\n1825, all vessels suffered to trade with the colonies being permitted\r\nto clear from thence with any articles which British vessels might\r\nexport and proceed to any part of the world, Great Britain and her\r\ndependencies alone excepted. On our part each of the above points had\r\nin succession been explicitly abandoned in negotiations preceding that\r\nof which the result is now announced.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement secures to the United States every advantage asked by\r\nthem, and which the state of the negotiation allowed us to insist upon.\r\nThe trade will be placed upon a footing decidedly more favorable to\r\nthis country than any on which it ever stood, and our commerce and\r\nnavigation will enjoy in the colonial ports of Great Britain every\r\nprivilege allowed to other nations.\r\n\r\nThat the prosperity of the country so far as it depends on this trade\r\nwill be greatly promoted by the new arrangement there can be no doubt.\r\nIndependently of the more obvious advantages of an open and direct\r\nintercourse, its establishment will be attended with other consequences\r\nof a higher value. That which has been carried on since the mutual\r\ninterdict under all the expense and inconvenience unavoidably incident\r\nto it would have been insupportably onerous had it not been in a great\r\ndegree lightened by concerted evasions in the mode of making the\r\ntransshipments at what are called the neutral ports. These indirections\r\nare inconsistent with the dignity of nations that have so many motives\r\nnot only to cherish feelings of mutual friendship, but to maintain such\r\nrelations as will stimulate their respective citizens and subjects to\r\nefforts of direct, open, and honorable competition only, and preserve\r\nthem from the influence of seductive and vitiating circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhen your preliminary interposition was asked at the close of the last\r\nsession, a copy of the instructions under which Mr. McLane has acted,\r\ntogether with the communications which had at that time passed between\r\nhim and the British Government, was laid before you. Although there has\r\nnot been any thing in the acts of the two Governments which requires\r\nsecrecy, it was thought most proper in the then state of the\r\nnegotiation to make that communication a confidential one. So soon,\r\nhowever, as the evidence of execution on the part of Great Britain is\r\nreceived the whole matter shall be laid before you, when it will be\r\nseen that the apprehension which appears to have suggested one of the\r\nprovisions of the act passed at your last session, that the restoration\r\nof the trade in question might be connected with other subjects and was\r\nsought to be obtained at the sacrifice of the public interest in other\r\nparticulars, was wholly unfounded, and that the change which has taken\r\nplace in the views of the British Government has been induced by\r\nconsiderations as honorable to both parties as I trust the result will\r\nprove beneficial.\r\n\r\nThis desirable result was, it will be seen, greatly promoted by the\r\nliberal and confiding provisions of the act of Congress of the last\r\nsession, by which our ports were upon the reception and annunciation by\r\nthe President of the required assurance on the part of Great Britain\r\nforthwith opened to her vessels before the arrangement could be carried\r\ninto effect on her part, pursuing in this act of prospective\r\nlegislation a similar course to that adopted by Great Britain in\r\nabolishing, by her act of Parliament in 1825, a restriction then\r\nexisting and permitting our vessels to clear from the colonies on their\r\nreturn voyages for any foreign country whatever before British vessels\r\nhad been relieved from the restriction imposed by our law of returning\r\ndirectly from the United States to the colonies, a restriction which\r\nshe required and expected that we should abolish. Upon each occasion a\r\nlimited and temporary advantage has been given to the opposite party,\r\nbut an advantage of no importance in comparison with the restoration of\r\nmutual confidence and good feeling, and the ultimate establishment of\r\nthe trade upon fair principles.\r\n\r\nIt gives me unfeigned pleasure to assure you that this negotiation has\r\nbeen throughout characterized by the most frank and friendly spirit on\r\nthe part of Great Britain, and concluded in a manner strongly\r\nindicative of a sincere desire to cultivate the best relations with the\r\nUnited States. To reciprocate this disposition to the fullest extent of\r\nmy ability is a duty which I shall deem it a privilege to discharge.\r\n\r\nAlthough the result is itself the best commentary on the services\r\nrendered to his country by our minister at the Court of St. James, it\r\nwould be doing violence to my feelings were I to dismiss the subject\r\nwithout expressing the very high sense I entertain of the talent and\r\nexertion which have been displayed by him on the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe injury to the commerce of the United States resulting from the\r\nexclusion of our vessels from the Black Sea and the previous footing of\r\nmere sufferance upon which even the limited trade enjoyed by us with\r\nTurkey has hitherto been placed have for a long time been a source of\r\nmuch solicitude to this Government, and several endeavors have been\r\nmade to obtain a better state of things. Sensible of the importance of\r\nthe object, I felt it my duty to leave no proper means unemployed to\r\nacquire for our flag the same privileges that are enjoyed by the\r\nprincipal powers of Europe. Commissioners were consequently appointed\r\nto open a negotiation with the Sublime Porte. Not long after the member\r\nof the commission who went directly from the United States had sailed,\r\nthe account of the treaty of Adrianople, by which one of the objects in\r\nview was supposed to be secured, reached this country. The Black Sea\r\nwas understood to be opened to us. Under the supposition that this was\r\nthe case, the additional facilities to be derived from the\r\nestablishment of commercial regulations with the Porte were deemed of\r\nsufficient importance to require a prosecution of the negotiation as\r\noriginally contemplated. It was therefore persevered in, and resulted\r\nin a treaty, which will be forthwith laid before the Senate.\r\n\r\nBy its provisions a free passage is secured, without limitations of\r\ntime, to the vessels of the United States to and from the Black Sea,\r\nincluding the navigation thereof, and our trade with Turkey is placed\r\non the footing of the most favored nation. The latter is an arrangement\r\nwholly independent of the treaty of Adrianople, and the former derives\r\nmuch value, not only from the increased security which under any\r\ncircumstances it would give to the right in question, but from the\r\nfact, ascertained in the course of the negotiation, that by the\r\nconstruction put upon that treaty by Turkey the article relating to the\r\npassage of the Bosphorus is confined to nations having treaties with\r\nthe Porte. The most friendly feelings appear to be entertained by the\r\nSultan, and an enlightened disposition is evinced by him to foster the\r\nintercourse between the two countries by the most liberal arrangements.\r\nThis disposition it will be our duty and interest to cherish.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Russia are of the most stable character. Respect for\r\nthat Empire and confidence in its friendship toward the United States\r\nhave been so long entertained on our part and so carefully cherished by\r\nthe present Emperor and his illustrious predecessor as to have become\r\nincorporated with the public sentiment of the United States. No means\r\nwill be left unemployed on my part to promote these salutary feelings\r\nand those improvements of which the commercial intercourse between the\r\ntwo countries is susceptible, and which have derived increased\r\nimportance from our treaty with the Sublime Porte.\r\n\r\nI sincerely regret to inform you that our minister lately commissioned\r\nto that Court, on whose distinguished talents and great experience in\r\npublic affairs I place great reliance, has been compelled by extreme\r\nindisposition to exercise a privilege which, in consideration of the\r\nextent to which his constitution had been impaired in the public\r\nservice, was committed to his discretion--of leaving temporarily his\r\npost for the advantage of a more genial climate.\r\n\r\nIf, as it is to be hoped, the improvement of his health should be such\r\nas to justify him in doing so, he will repair to St. Petersburg and\r\nresume the discharge of his official duties. I have received the most\r\nsatisfactory assurances that in the mean time the public interest in\r\nthat quarter will be preserved from prejudice by the intercourse which\r\nhe will continue through the secretary of legation with the Russian\r\ncabinet.\r\n\r\nYou are apprised, although the fact has not yet been officially\r\nannounced to the House of Representatives, that a treaty was in the\r\nmonth of March last concluded between the United States, and Denmark,\r\nby which $650 thousand are secured to our citizens as an indemnity for\r\nspoliations upon their commerce in the years 1808, 1809, 1810, and\r\n1811. This treaty was sanctioned by the Senate at the close of its last\r\nsession, and it now becomes the duty of Congress to pass the necessary\r\nlaws for the organization of the board of commissioners to distribute\r\nthe indemnity among the claimants. It is an agreeable circumstance in\r\nthis adjustment that the terms are in conformity with the previously\r\nascertained views of the claimants themselves, thus removing all\r\npretense for a future agitation of the subject in any form.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations in regard to such points in our foreign relations as\r\nremain to be adjusted have been actively prosecuted during the recess.\r\nMaterial advances have been made, which are of a character to promise\r\nfavorable results. Our country, by the blessing of God, is not in a\r\nsituation to invite aggression, and it will be our fault if she ever\r\nbecomes so. Sincerely desirous to cultivate the most liberal and\r\nfriendly relations with all; ever ready to fulfill our engagements with\r\nscrupulous fidelity; limiting our demands upon others to mere justice;\r\nholding ourselves ever ready to do unto them as we would wish to be\r\ndone by, and avoiding even the appearance of undue partiality to any\r\nnation, it appears to me impossible that a simple and sincere\r\napplication of our principles to our foreign relations can fail to\r\nplace them ultimately upon the footing on which it is our wish they\r\nshould rest.\r\n\r\nOf the points referred to, the most prominent are our claims upon\r\nFrance for spoliations upon our commerce; similar claims upon Spain,\r\ntogether with embarrassments in the commercial intercourse between the\r\ntwo countries which ought to be removed; the conclusion of the treaty\r\nof commerce and navigation with Mexico, which has been so long in\r\nsuspense, as well as the final settlement of limits between ourselves\r\nand that Republic, and, finally, the arbitrament of the question\r\nbetween the United States and Great Britain in regard to the\r\nnorth-eastern boundary.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation with France has been conducted by our minister with\r\nzeal and ability, and in all respects to my entire satisfaction.\r\nAlthough the prospect of a favorable termination was occasionally\r\ndimmed by counter pretensions to which the United States could not\r\nassent, he yet had strong hopes of being able to arrive at a\r\nsatisfactory settlement with the late Government. The negotiation has\r\nbeen renewed with the present authorities, and, sensible of the general\r\nand lively confidence of our citizens in the justice and magnanimity of\r\nregenerated France, I regret the more not to have it in my power yet to\r\nannounce the result so confidently anticipated. No ground, however,\r\ninconsistent with this expectation has yet been taken, and I do not\r\nallow myself to doubt that justice will soon be done us. The amount of\r\nthe claims, the length of time they have remained unsatisfied, and\r\ntheir incontrovertible justice make an earnest prosecution of them by\r\nthis Government an urgent duty. The illegality of the seizures and\r\nconfiscations out of which they have arisen is not disputed, and what\r\never distinctions may have heretofore been set up in regard to the\r\nliability of the existing Government it is quite clear that such\r\nconsiderations can not now be interposed.\r\n\r\nThe commercial intercourse between the two countries is susceptible of\r\nhighly advantageous improvements, but the sense of this injury has had,\r\nand must continue to have, a very unfavorable influence upon them. From\r\nits satisfactory adjustment not only a firm and cordial friendship, but\r\na progressive development of all their relations, may be expected. It\r\nis, therefore, my earnest hope that this old and vexatious subject of\r\ndifference may be speedily removed.\r\n\r\nI feel that my confidence in our appeal to the motives which should\r\ngovern a just and magnanimous nation is alike warranted by the\r\ncharacter of the French people and by the high voucher we possess for\r\nthe enlarged views and pure integrity of the Monarch who now presides\r\nover their councils, and nothing shall be wanting on my part to meet\r\nany manifestation of the spirit we anticipate in one of corresponding\r\nfrankness and liberality.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of difference with Spain have been brought to the view of\r\nthat Government by our minister there with much force and propriety,\r\nand the strongest assurances have been received of their early and\r\nfavorable consideration.\r\n\r\nThe steps which remained to place the matter in controversy between\r\nGreat Britain and the United States fairly before the arbitrator have\r\nall been taken in the same liberal and friendly spirit which\r\ncharacterized those before announced. Recent events have doubtless\r\nserved to delay the decision, but our minister at the Court of the\r\ndistinguished arbitrator has been assured that it will be made within\r\nthe time contemplated by the treaty.\r\n\r\nI am particularly gratified in being able to state that a decidedly\r\nfavorable, and, as I hope, lasting, change has been effected in our\r\nrelations with the neighboring Republic of Mexico. The unfortunate and\r\nunfounded suspicions in regard to our disposition which it became my\r\npainful duty to advert to on a former occasion have been, I believe,\r\nentirely removed, and the Government of Mexico has been made to\r\nunderstand the real character of the wishes and views of this in regard\r\nto that country. The consequences is the establishment of friendship\r\nand mutual confidence. Such are the assurances I have received, and I\r\nsee no cause to doubt their sincerity.\r\n\r\nI had reason to expect the conclusion of a commercial treaty with\r\nMexico in season for communication on the present occasion.\r\nCircumstances which are not explained, but which I am persuaded are not\r\nthe result of an indisposition on her part to enter into it, have\r\nproduced the delay.\r\n\r\nThere was reason to fear in the course of the last summer that the\r\nharmony of our relations might be disturbed by the acts of certain\r\nclaimants, under Mexican grants, of territory which had hitherto been\r\nunder our jurisdiction. The cooperation of the representative of Mexico\r\nnear this Government was asked on the occasion and was readily\r\nafforded. Instructions and advice have been given to the governor of\r\nArkansas and the officers in command in the adjoining Mexican State by\r\nwhich it is hoped the quiet of that frontier will be preserved until a\r\nfinal settlement of the dividing line shall have removed all ground of\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\nThe exchange of ratifications of the treaty concluded last year with\r\nAustria has not yet taken place. The delay has been occasioned by the\r\nnon-arrival of the ratification of that Government within the time\r\nprescribed by the treaty. Renewed authority has been asked for by the\r\nrepresentative of Austria, and in the mean time the rapidly increasing\r\ntrade and navigation between the two countries have been placed upon\r\nthe most liberal footing of our navigation acts.\r\n\r\nSeveral alleged depredations have been recently committed on our\r\ncommerce by the national vessels of Portugal. They have been made the\r\nsubject of immediate remonstrance and reclamation. I am not yet\r\npossessed of sufficient information to express a definitive opinion of\r\ntheir character, but expect soon to receive it. No proper means shall\r\nbe omitted to obtain for our citizens all the redress to which they may\r\nappear to be entitled.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the moment of the adjournment of your last session two\r\nbills--the one entitled \"An act for making appropriations for building\r\nlight houses, light boats, beacons, and monuments, placing buoys, and\r\nfor improving harbors and directing surveys\", and the other \"An act to\r\nauthorize a subscription for stock in the Louisville and Portland Canal\r\nCompany\"--were submitted for my approval. It was not possible within\r\nthe time allowed for me before the close of the session to give to\r\nthese bills the consideration which was due to their character and\r\nimportance, and I was compelled to retain them for that purpose. I now\r\navail myself of this early opportunity to return them to the Houses in\r\nwhich they respectively originated with the reasons which, after mature\r\ndeliberation, compel me to withhold my approval.\r\n\r\nThe practice of defraying out of the Treasury of the United States the\r\nexpenses incurred by the establishment and support of light houses,\r\nbeacons, buoys, and public piers within the bays, inlets, harbors, and\r\nports of the United States, to render the navigation thereof safe and\r\neasy, is coeval with the adoption of the Constitution, and has been\r\ncontinued without interruption or dispute.\r\n\r\nAs our foreign commerce increased and was extended into the interior of\r\nthe country by the establishment of ports of entry and delivery upon\r\nour navigable rivers the sphere of those expenditures received a\r\ncorresponding enlargement. Light houses, beacons, buoys, public piers,\r\nand the removal of sand bars, sawyers, and other partial or temporary\r\nimpediments in the navigable rivers and harbors which were embraced in\r\nthe revenue districts from time to time established by law were\r\nauthorized upon the same principle and the expense defrayed in the same\r\nmanner. That these expenses have at times been extravagant and\r\ndisproportionate is very probable. The circumstances under which they\r\nare incurred are well calculated to lead to such a result unless their\r\napplication is subjected to the closest scrutiny. The local advantages\r\narising from the disbursement of public money too frequently, it is to\r\nbe feared, invite appropriations for objects of this character that are\r\nneither necessary nor useful.\r\n\r\nThe number of light house keepers is already very large, and the bill\r\nbefore me proposes to add to it 51 more of various descriptions. From\r\nrepresentations upon the subject which are understood to be entitled to\r\nrespect I am induced to believe that there has not only been great\r\nimprovidence in the past expenditures of the Government upon these\r\nobjects, but that the security of navigation has in some instances been\r\ndiminished by the multiplication of light houses and consequent change\r\nof lights upon the coast. It is in this as in other respects our duty\r\nto avoid all unnecessary expense, as well as every increase of\r\npatronage not called for by the public service.\r\n\r\nBut in the discharge of that duty in this particular it must not be\r\nforgotten that in relation to our foreign commerce the burden and\r\nbenefit of protecting and accommodating it necessarily go together, and\r\nmust do so as long as the public revenue is drawn from the people\r\nthrough the custom house. It is indisputable that whatever gives\r\nfacility and security to navigation cheapens imports and all who\r\nconsume them are alike interested in what ever produces this effect. If\r\nthey consume, they ought, as they now do, to pay; otherwise they do not\r\npay. The consumer in the most inland State derives the same advantage\r\nfrom every necessary and prudent expenditure for the facility and\r\nsecurity of our foreign commerce and navigation that he does who\r\nresides in a maritime State. Local expenditures have not of themselves\r\na corresponding operation.\r\n\r\nFrom a bill making direct appropriations for such objects I should\r\nnot have withheld my assent. The one now returned does so in several\r\nparticulars, but it also contains appropriations for surveys of local\r\ncharacter, which I can not approve. It gives me satisfaction to find\r\nthat no serious inconvenience has arisen from withholding my approval\r\nfrom this bill; nor will it, I trust, be cause of regret that an\r\nopportunity will be thereby afforded for Congress to review its\r\nprovisions under circumstances better calculated for full investigation\r\nthan those under which it was passed.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of direct appropriations I mean not to include a practice\r\nwhich has obtained to some extent, and to which I have in one instance,\r\nin a different capacity, given my assent--that of subscribing to the\r\nstock of private associations. Positive experience and a more thorough\r\nconsideration of the subject have convinced me of the impropriety as\r\nwell as inexpediency of such investments. All improvements effected by\r\nthe funds of the nation for general use should be open to the enjoyment\r\nof all our fellow citizens, exempt from the payment of tolls or any\r\nimposition of that character. The practice of thus mingling the\r\nconcerns of the Government with those of the States or of individuals\r\nis inconsistent with the object of its institution and highly impolite.\r\nThe successful operation of the federal system can only be preserved by\r\nconfining it to the few and simple, but yet important, objects for\r\nwhich it was designed.\r\n\r\nA different practice, if allowed to progress, would ultimately change\r\nthe character of this Government by consolidating into one the General\r\nand State Governments, which were intended to be kept for ever\r\ndistinct. I can not perceive how bills authorizing such subscriptions\r\ncan be otherwise regarded than as bills for revenue, and consequently\r\nsubject to the rule in that respect prescribed by the Constitution. If\r\nthe interest of the Government in private companies is subordinate to\r\nthat of individuals, the management and control of a portion of the\r\npublic funds is delegated to an authority unknown to the Constitution\r\nand beyond the supervision of our constituents; if superior, its\r\nofficers and agents will be constantly exposed to imputations of\r\nfavoritism and oppression. Direct prejudice the public interest or an\r\nalienation of the affections and respect of portions of the people may,\r\ntherefore, in addition to the general discredit resulting to the\r\nGovernment from embarking with its constituents in pecuniary\r\nstipulations, be looked for as the probable fruit of such associations.\r\nIt is no answer to this objection to say that the extent of\r\nconsequences like these can not be great from a limited and small\r\nnumber of investments, because experience in other matters teaches\r\nus--and we are not at liberty to disregard its admonitions--that unless\r\nan entire stop be put to them it will soon be impossible to prevent\r\ntheir accumulation until they are spread over the whole country and\r\nmade to embrace many of the private and appropriate concerns of\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nThe power which the General Government would acquire within the several\r\nStates by becoming the principal stock-holder in corporations,\r\ncontrolling every canal and each 60 or 100 miles of every important\r\nroad, and giving a proportionate vote in all their elections, is almost\r\ninconceivable, and in my view dangerous to the liberties of the people.\r\n\r\nThis mode of aiding such works is also in its nature deceptive, and in\r\nmany cases conducive to improvidence in the administration of the\r\nnational funds. Appropriations will be obtained with much greater\r\nfacility and granted with less security to the public interest when the\r\nmeasure is thus disguised than when definite and direct expenditures of\r\nmoney are asked for. The interests of the nation would doubtless be\r\nbetter served by avoiding all such indirect modes of aiding particular\r\nobjects. In a government like ours more especially should all public\r\nacts be, as far as practicable, simple, undisguised, and intelligible,\r\nthat they may become fit subjects for the approbation to animadversion\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nThe bill authorizing a subscription to the Louisville and Portland\r\nCanal affords a striking illustration of the difficulty of withholding\r\nadditional appropriations for the same object when the first erroneous\r\nstep has been taken by instituting a partnership between the Government\r\nand private companies. It proposes a third subscription on the part of\r\nthe United States, when each preceding one was at the time regarded as\r\nthe extent of the aid which Government was to render to that work; and\r\nthe accompanying bill for light houses, etc., contains an appropriation\r\nfor a survey of the bed of the river, with a view to its improvement by\r\nremoving the obstruction which the canal is designed to avoid. This\r\nimprovement, if successful, would afford a free passage of the river\r\nand render the canal entirely useless. To such improvidence is the\r\ncourse of legislation subject in relation to internal improvements on\r\nlocal matters, even with the best intentions on the part of Congress.\r\n\r\nAlthough the motives which have influenced me in this matter may be\r\nalready sufficiently stated, I am, never the less, induced by its\r\nimportance to add a few observations of a general character.\r\n\r\nIn my objections to the bills authorizing subscriptions to the\r\nMaysville and Rockville road companies I expressed my views fully in\r\nregard to the power of Congress to construct roads and canals within a\r\nState of to appropriate money for improvements of a local character. I\r\nat the same time intimated me belief that the right to make\r\nappropriations for such as were of a national character had been so\r\ngenerally acted upon and so long acquiesced in by the Federal and State\r\nGovernments and the constituents of each as to justify its exercise on\r\nthe ground of continued and uninterrupted usage, but that it was, never\r\nthe less, highly expedient that appropriations even of that character\r\nshould, with the exception made at the time, be deferred until the\r\nnational debt is paid, and that in the mean while some general rule for\r\nthe action of the Government in that respect ought to be established.\r\n\r\nThese suggestions were not necessary to the decision of the question\r\nthen before me, and were, I readily admit, intended to awake the\r\nattention and draw forth the opinion and observations of our\r\nconstituents upon a subject of the highest importance to their\r\ninterests, and one destined to exert a powerful influence upon the\r\nfuture operations of our political system. I know of no tribunal to\r\nwhich a public man in this country, in a case of doubt and difficulty,\r\ncan appeal with greater advantage or more propriety than the judgment\r\nof the people; and although I must necessarily in the discharge of my\r\nofficial duties be governed by the dictates of my own judgment, I have\r\nno desire to conceal my anxious wish to conform as far as I can to the\r\nviews of those for whom I act.\r\n\r\nAll irregular expressions of public opinion are of necessity attended\r\nwith some doubt as to their accuracy, but making full allowances on\r\nthat account I can not, I think, deceive myself in believing that the\r\nacts referred to, as well as the suggestions which I allowed myself to\r\nmake in relation to their bearing upon the future operations of the\r\nGovernment, have been approved by the great body of the people. That\r\nthose whose immediate pecuniary interests are to be affected by\r\nproposed expenditures should shrink from the application of a rule\r\nwhich prefers their more general and remote interests to those which\r\nare personal and immediate is to be expected. But even such objections\r\nmust from the nature of our population be but temporary in their\r\nduration, and if it were otherwise our course should be the same, for\r\nthe time is yet, I hope, far distant when those intrusted with power to\r\nbe exercised for the good of the whole will consider it either honest\r\nor wise to purchase local favors at the sacrifice of principle and\r\ngeneral good.\r\n\r\nSo understanding public sentiment, and thoroughly satisfied that the\r\nbest interests of our common country imperiously require that the\r\ncourse which I have recommended in this regard should be adopted, I\r\nhave, upon the most mature consideration, determined to pursue it.\r\n\r\nIt is due to candor, as well as to my own feelings, that I should\r\nexpress the reluctance and anxiety which I must at all times experience\r\nin exercising the undoubted right of the Executive to withhold his\r\nassent from bills on other grounds than their constitutionality. That\r\nthis right should not be exercised on slight occasions all will admit.\r\nIt is only in matters of deep interest, when the principle involved may\r\nbe justly regarded as next in importance to infractions of the\r\nConstitution itself, that such a step can be expected to meet with the\r\napprobation of the people. Such an occasion do I conscientiously\r\nbelieve the present to be.\r\n\r\nIn the discharge of this delicate and highly responsible duty I am\r\nsustained by the reflection that the exercise of this power has been\r\ndeemed consistent with the obligation of official duty by several of my\r\npredecessors, and by the persuasion, too, that what ever liberal\r\ninstitutions may have to fear from the encroachments of Executive\r\npower, which has been every where the cause of so much strife and\r\nbloody contention, but little danger is to be apprehended from a\r\nprecedent by which that authority denies to itself the exercise of\r\npowers that bring in their train influence and patronage of great\r\nextent, and thus excludes the operation of personal interests, every\r\nwhere the bane of official trust.\r\n\r\nI derive, too, no small degree of satisfaction from the reflection that\r\nif I have mistaken the interests and wishes of the people the\r\nConstitution affords the means of soon redressing the error by\r\nselecting for the place their favor has bestowed upon me a citizen\r\nwhose opinions may accord with their own. I trust, in the mean time,\r\nthe interests of the nation will be saved from prejudice by a rigid\r\napplication of that portion of the public funds which might otherwise\r\nbe applied to different objects to that highest of all our obligations,\r\nthe payment of the public debt, and an opportunity be afforded for the\r\nadoption of some better rule for the operations of the Government in\r\nthis matter than any which has hitherto been acted upon.\r\n\r\nProfoundly impressed with the importance of the subject, not merely as\r\nrelates to the general prosperity of the country, but to the safety of\r\nthe federal system, I can not avoid repeating my earnest hope that all\r\ngood citizens who take a proper interest in the success and harmony of\r\nour admirable political institutions, and who are incapable of desiring\r\nto convert an opposite state of things into means for the gratification\r\nof personal ambition, will, laying aside minor considerations and\r\ndiscarding local prejudices, unite their honest exertions to establish\r\nsome fixed general principle which shall be calculated to effect the\r\ngreatest extent of public good in regard to the subject of internal\r\nimprovement, and afford the least ground for sectional discontent.\r\n\r\nThe general grounds of my objection to local appropriations have been\r\nheretofore expressed, and I shall endeavor to avoid a repetition of\r\nwhat has been already urged--the importance of sustaining the State\r\nsovereignties as far as is consistent with the rightful action of the\r\nFederal Government, and of preserving the greatest attainable harmony\r\nbetween them. I will now only add an expression of my conviction--a\r\nconviction which every day's experience serves to confirm--that the\r\npolitical creed which inculcates the pursuit of those great objects as\r\na paramount duty is the true faith, and one to which we are mainly\r\nindebted for the present success of the entire system, and to which we\r\nmust alone look for its future stability.\r\n\r\nThat there are diversities in the interests of the different States\r\nwhich compose this extensive Confederacy must be admitted. Those\r\ndiversities arising from situation, climate, population, and pursuits\r\nare doubtless, as it is natural they should be, greatly exaggerated by\r\njealousies and that spirit of rivalry so inseparable from neighboring\r\ncommunities. These circumstances make it the duty of those who are\r\nintrusted with the management of its affairs to neutralize their\r\neffects as far as practicable by making the beneficial operation of the\r\nFederal Government as equal and equitable among the several States as\r\ncan be done consistently with the great ends of its institution.\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary to refer to undoubted facts to see how far the\r\npast acts of the Government upon the subject under consideration have\r\nfallen short of this object. The expenditures heretofore made for\r\ninternal improvements amount to upward of $5 millions, and have been\r\ndistributed in very unequal proportions amongst the States. The\r\nestimated expense of works of which surveys have been made, together\r\nwith that of others projected and partially surveyed, amounts to more\r\nthan $96 millions.\r\n\r\nThat such improvements, on account of particular circumstances, may be\r\nmore advantageously and beneficially made in some States than in others\r\nis doubtless true, but that they are of a character which should\r\nprevent an equitable distribution of the funds amongst the several\r\nStates is not to be conceded. The want of this equitable distribution\r\ncan not fail to prove a prolific source of irritation among the States.\r\n\r\nWe have it constantly before our eyes that professions of superior zeal\r\nin the cause of internal improvement and a disposition to lavish the\r\npublic funds upon objects of this character are daily and earnestly put\r\nforth by aspirants to power as constituting the highest claims to the\r\nconfidence of the people. Would it be strange, under such\r\ncircumstances, and in times of great excitement, that grants of this\r\ndescription should find their motives in objects which may not accord\r\nwith the public good? Those who have not had occasion to see and regret\r\nthe indication of a sinister influence in these matters in past times\r\nhave been more fortunate than myself in their observation of the course\r\nof public affairs. If to these evils be added the combinations and\r\nangry contentions to which such a course of things gives rise, with\r\ntheir baleful influences upon the legislation of Congress touching the\r\nleading and appropriate duties of the Federal Government, it was but\r\ndoing justice to the character of our people to expect the severe\r\ncondemnation of the past which the recent exhibitions of public\r\nsentiment has evinced.\r\n\r\nNothing short of a radical change in the action of the Government upon\r\nthe subject can, in my opinion, remedy the evil. If, as it would be\r\nnatural to expect, the States which have been least favored in past\r\nappropriations should insist on being redressed in those here after to\r\nbe made, at the expense of the States which have so largely and\r\ndisproportionately participated, we have, as matters now stand, but\r\nlittle security that the attempt would do more than change the\r\ninequality from one quarter to another.\r\n\r\nThus viewing the subject, I have heretofore felt it my duty to\r\nrecommend the adoption of some plan for the distribution of the surplus\r\nfunds, which may at any time remain in the Treasury after the national\r\ndebt shall have been paid, among the States, in proportion to the\r\nnumber of their Representatives, to be applied by them to objects of\r\ninternal improvement.\r\n\r\nAlthough this plan has met with favor in some portions of the Union, it\r\nhas also elicited objections which merit deliberate consideration. A\r\nbrief notice of these objections here will not, therefore, I trust, be\r\nregarded as out of place.\r\n\r\nThey rest, as far as they have come to my knowledge, on the following\r\ngrounds: first, an objection to the ration of distribution; second, an\r\napprehension that the existence of such a regulation would produce\r\nimprovident and oppressive taxation to raise the funds for\r\ndistribution; 3rd, that the mode proposed would lead to the\r\nconstruction of works of a local nature, to the exclusion of such as\r\nare general and as would consequently be of a more useful character;\r\nand, last, that it would create a discreditable and injurious\r\ndependence on the part of the State governments upon the Federal power.\r\n\r\nOf those who object to the ration of representatives as the basis of\r\ndistribution, some insist that the importations of the respective\r\nStates would constitute one that would be more equitable; and others\r\nagain, that the extent of their respective territories would furnish a\r\nstandard which would be more expedient and sufficiently equitable. The\r\nration of representation presented itself to my mind, and it still\r\ndoes, as one of obvious equity, because of its being the ratio of\r\ncontribution, whether the funds to be distributed be derived from the\r\ncustoms or from direct taxation. It does not follow, however, that its\r\nadoption is indispensable to the establishment of the system proposed.\r\nThere may be considerations appertaining to the subject which would\r\nrender a departure, to some extent, from the rule of contribution\r\nproper. Nor is it absolutely necessary that the basis of distribution\r\nbe confined to one ground. It may, if in the judgment of those whose\r\nright it is to fix it it be deemed politic and just to give it that\r\ncharacter, have regard to several.\r\n\r\nIn my first message I stated it to be my opinion that \"it is not\r\nprobably that any adjustment of the tariff upon principles satisfactory\r\nto the people of the Union will until a remote period, if ever, leave\r\nthe Government without a considerable surplus in the Treasury beyond\r\nwhat may be required for its current surplus\". I have had no cause to\r\nchange that opinion, but much to confirm it. Should these expectations\r\nbe realized, a suitable fund would thus be produced for the plan under\r\nconsideration to operate upon, and if there be no such fund its\r\nadoption will, in my opinion, work no injury to any interest; for I can\r\nnot assent to the justness of the apprehension that the establishment\r\nof the proposed system would tend to the encouragement of improvident\r\nlegislation of the character supposed. What ever the proper authority\r\nin the exercise of constitutional power shall at any time here after\r\ndecide to be for the general good will in that as in other respects\r\ndeserve and receive the acquiescence and support of the whole country,\r\nand we have ample security that every abuse of power in that regard by\r\nagents of the people will receive a speedy and effectual corrective at\r\ntheir hands. The views which I take of the future, founded on the\r\nobvious and increasing improvement of all classes of our fellow\r\ncitizens in intelligence and in public and private virtue, leave me\r\nwithout much apprehension on that head.\r\n\r\nI do not doubt that those who come after us will be as much alive as we\r\nare to the obligation upon all the trustees of political power to\r\nexempt those for whom they act from all unnecessary burthens, and as\r\nsensible of the great truth that the resources of the nation beyond\r\nthose required for immediate and necessary purposes of Government can\r\nno where be so well deposited as in the pockets of the people.\r\n\r\nIt may some times happen that the interests of particular States would\r\nnot be deemed to coincide with the general interest in relation to\r\nimprovements within such States. But if the danger to be apprehended\r\nfrom this source is sufficient to require it, a discretion might be\r\nreserved to Congress to direct to such improvements of a general\r\ncharacter as the States concerned might not be disposed to unite in,\r\nthe application of the quotas of those States, under the restriction of\r\nconfining to each State the expenditure of its appropriate quota. It\r\nmay, however, be assumed as a safe general rule that such improvements\r\nas serve to increase the prosperity of the respective States in which\r\nthey are made, by giving new facilities to trade, and thereby\r\naugmenting the wealth and comfort of their inhabitants, constitute the\r\nsurest mode of conferring permanent and substantial advantages upon the\r\nwhole. The strength as well as the true glory of the Confederacy is\r\nfounded on the prosperity and power of the several independent\r\nsovereignties of which it is composed and the certainty with which they\r\ncan be brought into successful active cooperation through the agency of\r\nthe Federal Government.\r\n\r\nIt is, more over, within the knowledge of such as are at all conversant\r\nwith public affairs that schemes of internal improvement have from time\r\nto time been proposed which, from their extent and seeming\r\nmagnificence, were readily regarded as of national concernment, but\r\nwhich upon fuller consideration and further experience would now be\r\nrejected with great unanimity.\r\n\r\nThat the plan under consideration would derive important advantages\r\nfrom its certainty, and that the moneys set apart for these purposes\r\nwould be more judiciously applied and economically expended under the\r\ndirection of the State legislatures, in which every part of each State\r\nis immediately represented, can not, I think, be doubted. In the new\r\nStates particularly, where a comparatively small population is\r\nscattered over an extensive surface, and the representation in Congress\r\nconsequently very limited, it is natural to expect that the\r\nappropriations made by the Federal Government would be more likely to\r\nbe expended in the vicinity of those numbers through whose immediate\r\nagency they were obtained than if the funds were placed under the\r\ncontrol of the legislature, in which every county of the State has its\r\nown representative. This supposition does not necessarily impugn the\r\nmotives of such Congressional representatives, nor is it so intended.\r\nWe are all sensible of the bias to which the strongest minds and purest\r\nhearts are, under such circumstances, liable. In respect to the last\r\nobjection--its probable effect upon the dignity and independence of\r\nState governments--it appears to me only necessary to state the case as\r\nit is, and as it would be if the measure proposed were adopted, to show\r\nthat the operation is most likely to be the very reverse of that which\r\nthe objection supposes.\r\n\r\nIn the one case the State would receive its quota of the national\r\nrevenue for domestic use upon a fixed principle as a matter of right,\r\nand from a fund to the creation of which it had itself contributed its\r\nfair proportion. Surely there could be nothing derogatory in that. As\r\nmatters now stand the States themselves, in their sovereign character,\r\nare not unfrequently petitioners at the bar of the Federal Legislature\r\nfor such allowances out of the National Treasury as it may comport with\r\ntheir pleasure or sense of duty to bestow upon them. It can not require\r\nargument to prove which of the two courses is most compatible with the\r\nefficiency or respectability of the State governments.\r\n\r\nBut all these are matters for discussion and dispassionate\r\nconsideration. That the desired adjustment would be attended with\r\ndifficulty affords no reason why it should not be attempted. The\r\neffective operation of such motives would have prevented the adoption\r\nof the Constitution under which we have so long lived and under the\r\nbenign influence of which our beloved country has so signally\r\nprospered. The framers of that sacred instrument had greater\r\ndifficulties to overcome, and they did overcome them. The patriotism of\r\nthe people, directed by a deep conviction of the importance of the\r\nUnion, produced mutual concession and reciprocal forbearance. Strict\r\nright was merged in a spirit of compromise, and the result has\r\nconsecrated their disinterested devotion to the general weal. Unless\r\nthe American people have degenerated, the same result can be again\r\neffected when ever experience points out the necessity of a resort to\r\nthe same means to uphold the fabric which their fathers have reared.\r\n\r\nIt is beyond the power of man to make a system of government like ours\r\nor any other operate with precise equality upon States situated like\r\nthose which compose this Confederacy; nor is inequality always\r\ninjustice. Every State can not expect to shape the measures of the\r\nGeneral Government to suit its own particular interests. The causes\r\nwhich prevent it are seated in the nature of things, and can not be\r\nentirely counteracted by human means. Mutual forbearance becomes,\r\ntherefore, a duty obligatory upon all, and we may, I am confident,\r\ncount upon a cheerful compliance with this high injunction on the part\r\nof our constituents. It is not to be supposed that they will object to\r\nmake such comparatively inconsiderable sacrifices for the preservation\r\nof rights and privileges which other less favored portions of the world\r\nhave in vain waded through seas of blood to acquire.\r\n\r\nOur course is a safe one if it be but faithfully adhered to.\r\nAcquiescence in the constitutionally expressed will of the majority,\r\nand the exercise of that will in a spirit of moderation, justice, and\r\nbrotherly kindness, will constitute a cement which would for ever\r\npreserve our Union. Those who cherish and inculcate sentiments like\r\nthese render a most essential service to their country, while those who\r\nseek to weaken their influence are, how ever conscientious and praise\r\nworthy their intentions, in effect its worst enemies.\r\n\r\nIf the intelligence and influence of the country, instead of laboring\r\nto foment sectional prejudices, to be made subservient to party\r\nwarfare, were in good faith applied to the eradication of causes of\r\nlocal discontent, by the improvement of our institutions and by\r\nfacilitating their adaptation to the condition of the times, this task\r\nwould prove one of less difficulty. May we not hope that the obvious\r\ninterests of our common country and the dictates of an enlightened\r\npatriotism will in the end lead the public mind in that direction?\r\n\r\nAfter all, the nature of the subject does not admit of a plan wholly\r\nfree from objection. That which has for some time been in operation is,\r\nperhaps, the worst that could exist, and every advance that can be made\r\nin its improvement is a matter eminently worthy of your most deliberate\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nIt is very possible that one better calculated to effect the objects in\r\nview may yet be devised. If so, it is to be hoped that those who\r\ndisapprove the past and dissent from what is proposed for the future\r\nwill feel it their duty to direct their attention to it, as they must\r\nbe sensible that unless some fixed rule for the action of the Federal\r\nGovernment in this respect is established the course now attempted to\r\nbe arrested will be again resorted to. Any mode which is calculated to\r\ngive the greatest degree of effect and harmony to our legislation upon\r\nthe subject, which shall best serve to keep the movements of the\r\nFederal Government within the sphere intended by those who modeled and\r\nthose who adopted it, which shall lead to the extinguishment of the\r\nnational debt in the shortest period and impose the lightest burthens\r\nupon our constituents, shall receive from me a cordial and firm\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nAmong the objects of great national concern I can not omit to press\r\nagain upon your attention that part of the Constitution which regulates\r\nthe election of President and Vice-President. The necessity for its\r\namendment is made so clear to my mind by observation of its evils and\r\nby the many able discussions which they have elicited on the floor of\r\nCongress and elsewhere that I should be wanting to my duty were I to\r\nwithhold another expression of my deep solicitude on the subject. Our\r\nsystem fortunately contemplates a recurrence to first principles,\r\ndiffering in this respect from all that have preceded it, and securing\r\nit, I trust, equally against the decay and the commotions which have\r\nmarked the progress of other governments.\r\n\r\nOur fellow citizens, too, who in proportion to their love of liberty\r\nkeep a steady eye upon the means of sustaining it, do not require to be\r\nreminded of the duty they owe to themselves to remedy all essential\r\ndefects in so vital a part of their system. While they are sensible\r\nthat every evil attendant upon its operation is not necessarily\r\nindicative of a bad organization, but may proceed from temporary\r\ncauses, yet the habitual presence, or even a single instance, of evils\r\nwhich can be clearly traced to an organic defect will not, I trust, be\r\nover-looked through a too scrupulous veneration for the work of their\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution was an experiment committed to the virtue and\r\nintelligence of the great mass of our country-men, in whose ranks the\r\nframers of it themselves were to perform the part of patriotic\r\nobservation and scrutiny, and if they have passed from the stage of\r\nexistence with an increased confidence in its general adaptation to our\r\ncondition we should learn from authority so high the duty of fortifying\r\nthe points in it which time proves to be exposed rather than be\r\ndeterred from approaching them by the suggestions of fear or the\r\ndictates of misplaced reverence.\r\n\r\nA provision which does not secure to the people a direct choice of\r\ntheir Chief Magistrate, but has a tendency to defeat their will,\r\npresented to my mind such an inconsistence with the general spirit of\r\nour institutions that I was indeed to suggest for your consideration\r\nthe substitute which appeared to me at the same time the most likely to\r\ncorrect the evil and to meet the views of our constituents. The most\r\nmature reflection since has added strength to the belief that the best\r\ninterests of our country require the speedy adoption of some plan\r\ncalculated to effect this end. A contingency which some times places it\r\nin the power of a single member of the House of Representatives to\r\ndecide an election of so high and solemn a character is unjust to the\r\npeople, and becomes when it occurs a source of embarrassment to the\r\nindividuals thus brought into power and a cause of distrust of the\r\nrepresentative body.\r\n\r\nLiable as the Confederacy is, from its great extent, to parties founded\r\nupon sectional interests, and to a corresponding multiplication of\r\ncandidates for the Presidency, the tendency of the constitutional\r\nreference to the House of Representatives is to devolve the election\r\nupon that body in almost every instance, and, what ever choice may then\r\nbe made among the candidates thus presented to them, to swell the\r\ninfluence of particular interests to a degree inconsistent with the\r\ngeneral good. The consequences of this feature of the Constitution\r\nappear far more threatening to the peace and integrity of the Union\r\nthan any which I can conceive as likely to result from the simple\r\nlegislative action of the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nIt was a leading object with the framers of the Constitution to keep as\r\nseparate as possible the action of the legislative and executive\r\nbranches of the Government. To secure this object nothing is more\r\nessential than to preserve the former from all temptations of private\r\ninterest, and therefore so to direct the patronage of the latter as not\r\nto permit such temptations to be offered. Experience abundantly\r\ndemonstrates that every precaution in this respect is a valuable\r\nsafe-guard of liberty, and one which my reflections upon the tendencies\r\nof our system incline me to think should be made still stronger.\r\n\r\nIt was for this reason that, in connection with an amendment of the\r\nConstitution removing all intermediate agency in the choice of the\r\nPresident, I recommended some restrictions upon the re-eligibility of\r\nthat officer and upon the tenure of offices generally. The reason still\r\nexists, and I renew the recommendation with an increased confidence\r\nthat its adoption will strengthen those checks by which the\r\nConstitution designed to secure the independence of each department of\r\nthe Government and promote the healthful and equitable administration\r\nof all the trusts which it has created.\r\n\r\nThe agent most likely to contravene this design of the Constitution is\r\nthe Chief Magistrate. In order, particularly, that his appointment may\r\nas far as possible be placed beyond the reach of any improper\r\ninfluences; in order that he may approach the solemn responsibilities\r\nof the highest office in the gift of a free people uncommitted to any\r\nother course than the strict line of constitutional duty, and that the\r\nsecurities for this independence may be rendered as strong as the\r\nnature of power and the weakness of its possessor will admit, I can not\r\ntoo earnestly invite your attention to the propriety of promoting such\r\nan amendment of the Constitution as will render him ineligible after\r\none term of service.\r\n\r\nIt gives me pleasure to announce to Congress that the benevolent policy\r\nof the Government, steadily pursued for nearly 30 years, in relation to\r\nthe removal of the Indians beyond the white settlements is approaching\r\nto a happy consummation. Two important tribes have accepted the\r\nprovision made for their removal at the last session of Congress, and\r\nit is believed that their example will induce the remaining tribes also\r\nto seek the same obvious advantages.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of a speedy removal will be important to the United\r\nStates, to individual States, and to the Indians themselves. The\r\npecuniary advantages which it promises to the Government are the least\r\nof its recommendations. It puts an end to all possible danger of\r\ncollision between the authorities of the General and State Governments\r\non account of the Indians. It will place a dense and civilized\r\npopulation in large tracts of country now occupied by a few savage\r\nhunters. By opening the whole territory between Tennessee on the north\r\nand Louisiana on the south to the settlement of the whites it will\r\nincalculably strengthen the south west frontier and render the adjacent\r\nStates strong enough to repel future invasions without remote aid. It\r\nwill relieve the whole State of Mississippi and the western part of\r\nAlabama of Indian occupancy, and enable those States to advance rapidly\r\nin population, wealth, and power. It will separate the Indians from\r\nimmediate contact with settlements of whites; free them from the power\r\nof the States; enable them to pursue happiness in their own way and\r\nunder their own rude institutions; will retard the progress of decay,\r\nwhich is lessening their numbers, and perhaps cause them gradually,\r\nunder the protection of the Government and through the influence of\r\ngood counsels, to cast off their savage habits and become an\r\ninteresting, civilized, and Christian community. These consequences,\r\nsome of them so certain and the rest so probable, make the complete\r\nexecution of the plan sanctioned by Congress at their last session an\r\nobject of much solicitude.\r\n\r\nToward the aborigines of the country no one can indulge a more friendly\r\nfeeling than myself, or would go further in attempting to reclaim them\r\nfrom their wandering habits and make them a happy, prosperous people. I\r\nhave endeavored to impress upon them my own solemn convictions of the\r\nduties and powers of the General Government in relation to the State\r\nauthorities. For the justice of the laws passed by the States within\r\nthe scope of their reserved powers they are not responsible to this\r\nGovernment. As individuals we may entertain and express our opinions of\r\ntheir acts, but as a Government we have as little right to control them\r\nas we have to prescribe laws for other nations.\r\n\r\nWith a full understanding of the subject, the Choctaw and the Chickasaw\r\ntribes have with great unanimity determined to avail themselves of the\r\nliberal offers presented by the act of Congress, and have agreed to\r\nremove beyond the Mississippi River. Treaties have been made with them,\r\nwhich in due season will be submitted for consideration. In negotiating\r\nthese treaties they were made to understand their true condition, and\r\nthey have preferred maintaining their independence in the Western\r\nforests to submitting to the laws of the States in which they now\r\nreside. These treaties, being probably the last which will ever be made\r\nwith them, are characterized by great liberality on the part of the\r\nGovernment. They give the Indians a liberal sum in consideration of\r\ntheir removal, and comfortable subsistence on their arrival at their\r\nnew homes. If it be their real interest to maintain a separate\r\nexistence, they will there be at liberty to do so without the\r\ninconveniences and vexations to which they would unavoidably have been\r\nsubject in Alabama and Mississippi.\r\n\r\nHumanity has often wept over the fate of the aborigines of this\r\ncountry, and Philanthropy has been long busily employed in devising\r\nmeans to avert it, but its progress has never for a moment been\r\narrested, and one by one have many powerful tribes disappeared from the\r\nearth. To follow to the tomb the last of his race and to tread on the\r\ngraves of extinct nations excite melancholy reflections. But true\r\nphilanthropy reconciles the mind to these vicissitudes as it does to\r\nthe extinction of one generation to make room for another. In the\r\nmonuments and fortifications of an unknown people, spread over the\r\nextensive regions of the West, we behold the memorials of a once\r\npowerful race, which was exterminated of has disappeared to make room\r\nfor the existing savage tribes. Nor is there any thing in this which,\r\nupon a comprehensive view of the general interests of the human race,\r\nis to be regretted. Philanthropy could not wish to see this continent\r\nrestored to the condition in which it was found by our forefathers.\r\nWhat good man would prefer a country covered with forests and ranged by\r\na few thousand savages to our extensive Republic, studded with cities,\r\ntowns, and prosperous farms, embellished with all the improvements\r\nwhich art can devise or industry execute, occupied by more than\r\n12,000,000 happy people, and filled with all the blessings of liberty,\r\ncivilization, and religion?\r\n\r\nThe present policy of the Government is but a continuation of the same\r\nprogressive change by a milder process. The tribes which occupied the\r\ncountries now constituting the Eastern States were annihilated or have\r\nmelted away to make room for the whites. The waves of population and\r\ncivilization are rolling to the westward, and we now propose to acquire\r\nthe countries occupied by the red men of the South and West by a fair\r\nexchange, and, at the expense of the United States, to send them to a\r\nland where their existence may be prolonged and perhaps made perpetual.\r\n\r\nDoubtless it will be painful to leave the graves of their fathers; but\r\nwhat do they more than our ancestors did or than our children are now\r\ndoing? To better their condition in an unknown land our forefathers\r\nleft all that was dear in earthly objects. Our children by thousands\r\nyearly leave the land of their birth to seek new homes in distant\r\nregions. Does Humanity weep at these painful separations from every\r\nthing, animate and inanimate, with which the young heart has become\r\nentwined? Far from it. It is rather a source of joy that our country\r\naffords scope where our young population may range unconstrained in\r\nbody or in mind, developing the power and faculties of man in their\r\nhighest perfection.\r\n\r\nThese remove hundreds and almost thousands of miles at their own\r\nexpense, purchase the lands they occupy, and support themselves at\r\ntheir new homes from the moment of their arrival. Can it be cruel in\r\nthis Government when, by events which it can not control, the Indian is\r\nmade discontented in his ancient home to purchase his lands, to give\r\nhim a new and extensive territory, to pay the expense of his removal,\r\nand support him a year in his new abode? How many thousands of our own\r\npeople would gladly embrace the opportunity of removing to the West on\r\nsuch conditions! If the offers made to the Indians were extended to\r\nthem, they would be hailed with gratitude and joy.\r\n\r\nAnd is it supposed that the wandering savage has a stronger attachment\r\nto his home than the settled, civilized Christian? Is it more\r\nafflicting to him to leave the graves of his fathers than it is to our\r\nbrothers and children? Rightly considered, the policy of the General\r\nGovernment toward the red man is not only liberal, but generous. He is\r\nunwilling to submit to the laws of the States and mingle with their\r\npopulation. To save him from this alternative, or perhaps utter\r\nannihilation, the General Government kindly offers him a new home, and\r\nproposes to pay the whole expense of his removal and settlement.\r\n\r\nIn the consummation of a policy originating at an early period, and\r\nsteadily pursued by every Administration within the present century--so\r\njust to the States and so generous to the Indians--the Executive feels\r\nit has a right to expect the cooperation of Congress and of all good\r\nand disinterested men. The States, moreover, have a right to demand it.\r\nIt was substantially a part of the compact which made them members of\r\nour Confederacy. With Georgia there is an express contract; with the\r\nnew States an implied one of equal obligation. Why, in authorizing\r\nOhio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Mississippi, and Alabama to form\r\nconstitutions and become separate States, did Congress include within\r\ntheir limits extensive tracts of Indian lands, and, in some instances,\r\npowerful Indian tribes? Was it not understood by both parties that the\r\npower of the States was to be coextensive with their limits, and that\r\nwith all convenient dispatch the General Government should extinguish\r\nthe Indian title and remove every obstruction to the complete\r\njurisdiction of the State governments over the soil? Probably not one\r\nof those States would have accepted a separate existence--certainly it\r\nwould never have been granted by Congress--had it been understood that\r\nthey were to be confined for ever to those small portions of their\r\nnominal territory the Indian title to which had at the time been\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, a duty which this Government owes to the new States\r\nto extinguish as soon as possible the Indian title to all lands which\r\nCongress themselves have included within their limits. When this is\r\ndone the duties of the General Government in relation to the States and\r\nthe Indians within their limits are at an end. The Indians may leave\r\nthe State or not, as they choose. The purchase of their lands does not\r\nalter in the least their personal relations with the State government.\r\nNo act of the General Government has ever been deemed necessary to give\r\nthe States jurisdiction over the persons of the Indians. That they\r\npossess by virtue of their sovereign power within their own limits in\r\nas full a manner before as after the purchase of the Indian lands; nor\r\ncan this Government add to or diminish it.\r\n\r\nMay we not hope, therefore, that all good citizens, and none more\r\nzealously than those who think the Indians oppressed by subjection to\r\nthe laws of the States, will unite in attempting to open the eyes of\r\nthose children of the forest to their true condition, and by a speedy\r\nremoval to relieve them from all the evils, real or imaginary, present\r\nor prospective, with which they may be supposed to be threatened.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous causes of congratulation the condition of our impost\r\nrevenue deserves special mention, in as much as it promises the means\r\nof extinguishing the public debt sooner than was anticipated, and\r\nfurnishes a strong illustration of the practical effects of the present\r\ntariff upon our commercial interests.\r\n\r\nThe object of the tariff is objected to by some as unconstitutional,\r\nand it is considered by almost all as defective in many of its parts.\r\n\r\nThe power to impose duties on imports originally belonged to the\r\nseveral States. The right to adjust those duties with a view to the\r\nencouragement of domestic branches of industry is so completely\r\nincidental to that power that it is difficult to suppose the existence\r\nof the one without the other. The States have delegated their whole\r\nauthority over imports to the General Government without limitation or\r\nrestriction, saving the very inconsiderable reservation relating to\r\ntheir inspection laws. This authority having thus entirely passed from\r\nthe States, the right to exercise it for the purpose of protection does\r\nnot exist in them, and consequently if it be not possessed by the\r\nGeneral Government it must be extinct. Our political system would thus\r\npresent the anomaly of a people stripped of the right to foster their\r\nown industry and to counteract the most selfish and destructive policy\r\nwhich might be adopted by foreign nations. This sure can not be the\r\ncase. This indispensable power thus surrendered by the States must be\r\nwithin the scope of the authority on the subject expressly delegated to\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nIn this conclusion I am confirmed as well by the opinions of Presidents\r\nWashington, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe, who have each repeatedly\r\nrecommended the exercise of this right under the Constitution, as by\r\nthe uniform practice of Congress, the continued acquiescence of the\r\nStates, and the general understanding of the people.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of a more expedient adjustment of the present tariff,\r\nalthough great, are far from being insurmountable. Some are unwilling\r\nto improve any of its parts because they would destroy the whole;\r\nothers fear to touch the objectionable parts lest those they approve\r\nshould be jeoparded. I am persuaded that the advocates of these\r\nconflicting views do injustice to the American people and to their\r\nrepresentatives. The general interest is the interest of each, and my\r\nconfidence is entire that to insure the adoption of such modifications\r\nof the tariff as the general interest requires it is only necessary\r\nthat that interest should be understood.\r\n\r\nIt is an infirmity of our nature to mingle our interests and prejudices\r\nwith the operation of our reasoning powers, and attribute to the\r\nobjects of our likes and dislikes qualities they do not possess and\r\neffects they can not produce. The effects of the present tariff are\r\ndoubtless over-rated, both in its evils and in its advantages. By one\r\nclass of reasoners the reduced price of cotton and other agricultural\r\nproducts is ascribed wholly to its influence, and by another the\r\nreduced price of manufactured articles.\r\n\r\nThe probability is that neither opinion approaches the truth, and that\r\nboth are induced by that influence of interests and prejudices to which\r\nI have referred. The decrease of prices extends throughout the\r\ncommercial world, embracing not only the raw material and the\r\nmanufactured article, but provisions and lands. The cause must\r\ntherefore be deeper and more pervading than the tariff of the United\r\nStates. It may in a measure be attributable to the increased value of\r\nthe precious metals, produced by a diminution of the supply and an\r\nincrease in the demand, while commerce has rapidly extended itself and\r\npopulation has augmented. The supply of gold and silver, the general\r\nmedium of exchange, has been greatly interrupted by civil convulsions\r\nin the countries from which they are principally drawn. A part of the\r\neffect, too, is doubtless owing to an increase of operatives and\r\nimprovements in machinery. But on the whole it is questionable whether\r\nthe reduction in the price of lands, produce, and manufactures has been\r\ngreater than the appreciation of the standard of value.\r\n\r\nWhile the chief object of duties should be revenue, they may be so\r\nadjusted as to encourage manufactures. In this adjustment, however, it\r\nis the duty of the Government to be guided by the general good. Objects\r\nof national importance alone ought to be protected. Of these the\r\nproductions of our soil, our mines, and our work shops, essential to\r\nnational defense, occupy the first rank. What ever other species of\r\ndomestic industry, having the importance to which I have referred, may\r\nbe expected, after temporary protection, to compete with foreign labor\r\non equal terms merit the same attention in a subordinate degree.\r\n\r\nThe present tariff taxes some of the comforts of life unnecessarily\r\nhigh; it undertakes to protect interests too local and minute to\r\njustify a general exaction, and it also attempts to force some kinds of\r\nmanufactures for which the country is not ripe. Much relief will be\r\nderived in some of these respects from the measures of your last\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nThe best as well as fairest mode of determining whether from any just\r\nconsiderations a particular interest ought to receive protection would\r\nbe to submit the question singly for deliberation. If after\r\ndue examination of its merits, unconnected with extraneous\r\nconsiderations--such as a desire to sustain a general system or to\r\npurchase support for a different interest--it should enlist in its\r\nfavor a majority of the representatives of the people, there can be\r\nlittle danger of wrong or injury in adjusting the tariff with reference\r\nto its protective effect. If this obviously just principle were\r\nhonestly adhered to, the branches of industry which deserve protection\r\nwould be saved from the prejudice excited against them when that\r\nprotection forms part of a system by which portions of the country feel\r\nor conceive themselves to be oppressed. What is incalculably more\r\nimportant, the vital principle of our system--that principle which\r\nrequires acquiescence in the will of the majority--would be secure from\r\nthe discredit and danger to which it is exposed by the acts of\r\nmajorities founded not on identity of conviction, but on combinations\r\nof small minorities entered into for the purpose of mutual assistance\r\nin measures which, resting solely on their own merits, could never be\r\ncarried.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that this is a subject of so much delicacy, on account\r\nof the extended interests in involves, as to require that it should be\r\ntouched with the utmost caution, and that while an abandonment of the\r\npolicy in which it originated--a policy coeval with our Government, and\r\npursued through successive Administrations--is neither to be expected\r\nor desired, the people have a right to demand, and have demanded, that\r\nit be so modified as to correct abuses and obviate injustice.\r\n\r\nThat our deliberations on this interesting subject should be\r\nuninfluenced by those partisan conflicts that are incident to free\r\ninstitutions is the fervent wish of my heart. To make this great\r\nquestion, which unhappily so much divides and excites the public mind,\r\nsubservient to the short-sighted views of faction, must destroy all\r\nhope of settling it satisfactorily to the great body of the people and\r\nfor the general interest. I can not, therefore, in taking leave of the\r\nsubject, too earnestly for my own feelings or the common good warn you\r\nagainst the blighting consequences of such a course.\r\n\r\nAccording to the estimates at the Treasury Department, the receipts in\r\nthe Treasury during the present year will amount to $24,161,018, which\r\nwill exceed by about $300,000 the estimate presented in the last annual\r\nreport of the Secretary of the Treasury. The total expenditure during\r\nthe year, exclusive of public debt, is estimated at $13,742,311, and\r\nthe payment on account of public debt for the same period will have\r\nbeen $11,354,630, leaving a balance in the Treasury on January 1st,\r\n1831 of $4,819,781.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the condition of our finances, it affords me\r\npleasure to remark that judicious and efficient arrangements have been\r\nmade by the Treasury Department for securing the pecuniary\r\nresponsibility of the public officers and the more punctual payment of\r\nthe public dues. The Revenue Cutter Service has been organized and\r\nplaced on a good footing, and aided by an increase of inspectors at\r\nexposed points, and regulations adopted under the act of May, 1830, for\r\nthe inspection and appraisement of merchandise, has produced much\r\nimprovement in the execution of the laws and more security against the\r\ncommission of frauds upon the revenue. Abuses in the allowances for\r\nfishing bounties have also been corrected, and a material saving in\r\nthat branch of the service thereby effected. In addition to these\r\nimprovements the system of expenditure for sick sea men belonging to\r\nthe merchant service has been revised, and being rendered uniform and\r\neconomical the benefits of the fund applicable to this object have been\r\nusefully extended.\r\n\r\nThe prosperity of our country is also further evinced by the increased\r\nrevenue arising from the sale of public lands, as will appear from the\r\nreport of the Commissioner of the General Land Office and the documents\r\naccompanying it, which are herewith transmitted. I beg leave to draw\r\nyour attention to this report, and to the propriety of making early\r\nappropriations for the objects which it specifies.\r\n\r\nYour attention is again invited to the subjects connected with that\r\nportion of the public interests intrusted to the War Department. Some\r\nof them were referred to in my former message, and they are presented\r\nin detail in the report of the Secretary of War herewith submitted. I\r\nrefer you also to the report of that officer for a knowledge of the\r\nstate of the Army, fortifications, arsenals, and Indian affairs, all of\r\nwhich it will be perceived have been guarded with zealous attention and\r\ncare. It is worthy of your consideration whether the armaments\r\nnecessary for the fortifications on our maritime frontier which are now\r\nor shortly will be completed should not be in readiness sooner than the\r\ncustomary appropriations will enable the Department to provide them.\r\nThis precaution seems to be due to the general system of fortification\r\nwhich has been sanctioned by Congress, and is recommended by that maxim\r\nof wisdom which tells us in peace to prepare for war.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Navy for a highly\r\nsatisfactory account of the manner in which the concerns of that\r\nDepartment have been conducted during the present year. Our position in\r\nrelation to the most powerful nations of the earth, and the present\r\ncondition of Europe, admonish us to cherish this arm of our national\r\ndefense with peculiar care. Separated by wide seas from all those\r\nGovernments whose power we might have reason to dread, we have nothing\r\nto apprehend from attempts at conquest. It is chiefly attacks upon our\r\ncommerce and harrassing in-roads upon our coast against which we have\r\nto guard. A naval force adequate to the protection of our commerce,\r\nalways afloat, with an accumulation of the means to give it a rapid\r\nextension in case of need, furnishes the power by which all such\r\naggressions may be prevented or repelled. The attention of the\r\nGovernment has therefore been recently directed more to preserving the\r\npublic vessels already built and providing materials to be placed in\r\ndepot for future use than to increasing their number. With the aid of\r\nCongress, in a few years the Government will be prepared in case of\r\nemergency to put afloat a powerful navy of new ships almost as soon as\r\nold ones could be repaired.\r\n\r\nThe modifications in this part of the service suggested in my last\r\nannual message, which are noticed more in detail in the report of the\r\nSecretary of the Navy, are again recommended to your serious attention.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Post Master General in like manner exhibits a\r\nsatisfactory view of the important branch of the Government under his\r\ncharge. In addition to the benefits already secured by the operations\r\nof the Post Office Department, considerable improvements within the\r\npresent year have been made by an increase in the accommodation\r\nafforded by stage coaches, and in the frequency and celerity of the\r\nmail between some of the most important points of the Union.\r\n\r\nUnder the late contracts improvements have been provided for the\r\nsouthern section of the country, and at the same time an annual saving\r\nmade of upward of $72,000. Not with standing the excess of expenditure\r\nbeyond the current receipts for a few years past, necessarily incurred\r\nin the fulfillment of existing contracts and in the additional expenses\r\nbetween the periods of contracting to meet the demands created by the\r\nrapid growth and extension of our flourishing country, yet the\r\nsatisfactory assurance is given that the future revenue of the\r\nDepartment will be sufficient to meets its extensive engagements. The\r\nsystem recently introduced that subjects its receipts and disbursements\r\nto strict regulation has entirely fulfilled its designs. It gives full\r\nassurance of the punctual transmission, as well as the security of the\r\nfunds of the Department. The efficiency and industry of its officers\r\nand the ability and energy of contractors justify an increased\r\nconfidence in its continued prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress was called on a former occasion to the\r\nnecessity of such a modification in the office of Attorney General of\r\nthe United States as would render it more adequate to the wants of the\r\npublic service. This resulted in the establishment of the office of\r\nSolicitor of the Treasury, and the earliest measures were taken to give\r\neffect to the provisions of the law which authorized the appointment of\r\nthat officer and defined his duties. But it is not believed that this\r\nprovision, however useful in itself, is calculated to supersede the\r\nnecessity of extending the duties and powers of the Attorney General's\r\nOffice. On the contrary, I am convinced that the public interest would\r\nbe greatly promoted by giving to that officer the general\r\nsuperintendence of the various law agents of the Government, and of all\r\nlaw proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which the United States\r\nmay be interested, allowing him at the same time such compensation as\r\nwould enable him to devote his undivided attention to the public\r\nbusiness. I think such a provision is alike due to the public and to\r\nthe officer.\r\n\r\nOccasions of reference from the different Executive Departments to the\r\nAttorney General are of frequent occurrence, and the prompt decision of\r\nthe questions so referred tends much to facilitate the dispatch of\r\nbusiness in those Departments. The report of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury hereto appended shows also a branch of the public service not\r\nspecifically intrusted to any officer which might be advantageously\r\ncommitted to the Attorney General. But independently of those\r\nconsiderations this office is now one of daily duty. It was originally\r\norganized and its compensation fixed with a view to occasional service,\r\nleaving to the incumbent time for the exercise of his profession in\r\nprivate practice. The state of things which warranted such an\r\norganization no longer exists. The frequent claims upon the services of\r\nthis officer would render his absence from the seat of Government in\r\nprofessional attendance upon the courts injurious to the public\r\nservice, and the interests of the Government could not fail to be\r\npromoted by charging him with the general superintendence of all its\r\nlegal concerns.\r\n\r\nUnder a strong conviction of the justness of these suggestions, I\r\nrecommend it to Congress to make the necessary provisions for giving\r\neffect to them, and to place the Attorney General in regard to\r\ncompensation on the same footing with the heads of the several\r\nExecutive Departments. To this officer might also be intrusted a\r\ncognizance of the cases of insolvency in public debtors, especially if\r\nthe views which I submitted on this subject last year should meet the\r\napprobation of Congress--to which I again solicit your attention.\r\n\r\nYour attention is respectfully invited to the situation of the District\r\nof Columbia. Placed by the Constitution under the exclusive\r\njurisdiction and control of Congress, this District is certainly\r\nentitled to a much greater share of its consideration than it has yet\r\nreceived. There is a want of uniformity in its laws, particularly in\r\nthose of a penal character, which increases the expense of their\r\nadministration and subjects the people to all the inconveniences which\r\nresult from the operation of different codes in so small a territory.\r\nOn different sides of the Potomac the same offense is punishable in\r\nunequal degrees, and the peculiarities of many of the early laws of\r\nMaryland and Virginia remain in force, not with standing their\r\nrepugnance in some cases to the improvements which have superseded them\r\nin those States.\r\n\r\nBesides a remedy for these evils, which is loudly called for, it is\r\nrespectfully submitted whether a provision authorizing the election of\r\na delegate to represent the wants of the citizens of this District on\r\nthe floor of Congress is not due to them and to the character of our\r\nGovernment. No principles of freedom, and there is none more important\r\nthan that which cultivates a proper relation between the governors and\r\nthe governed. Imperfect as this must be in this case, yet it is\r\nbelieved that it would be greatly improved by a representation in\r\nCongress with the same privileges that are allowed to the other\r\nTerritories of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe penitentiary is ready for the reception of convicts, and only\r\nawaits the necessary legislation to put it into operation, as one\r\nobject of which I beg leave to recall your attention to the propriety\r\nof providing suitable compensation for the officers charged with its\r\ninspection.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the principles involved in the inquiry whether it\r\nwill be proper to recharter the Bank of the United States requires that\r\nI should again call the attention of Congress to the subject. Nothing\r\nhas occurred to lessen in any degree the dangers which many of our\r\ncitizens apprehend from that institution as at present organized. In\r\nthe spirit of improvement and compromise which distinguishes our\r\ncountry and its institutions it becomes us to inquire whether it be not\r\npossible to secure the advantages afforded by the present bank through\r\nthe agency of a Bank of the United States so modified in its principles\r\nand structures as to obviate constitutional and other objections.\r\n\r\nIt is thought practicable to organize such a bank with the necessary\r\nofficers as a branch of the Treasury Department, based on the public\r\nand individual deposits, without power to make loans or purchase\r\nproperty, which shall remit the funds of the Government, and the\r\nexpense of which may be paid, if thought advisable, by allowing its\r\nofficers to sell bills of exchange to private individuals at a moderate\r\npremium. Not being a corporate body, having no stock holders, debtors,\r\nor property, and but few officers, it would not be obnoxious to the\r\nconstitutional objections which are urged against the present bank; and\r\nhaving no means to operate on the hopes, fears, or interests of large\r\nmasses of the community, it would be shorn of the influence which makes\r\nthat bank formidable. The States would be strengthened by having in\r\ntheir hands the means of furnishing the local paper currency through\r\ntheir own banks, while the Bank of the United States, though issuing no\r\npaper, would check the issues of the State banks by taking their notes\r\nin deposit and for exchange only so long as they continue to be\r\nredeemed with specie. In times of public emergency the capacities of\r\nsuch an institution might be enlarged by legislative provisions.\r\n\r\nThese suggestions are made not so much as a recommendation as with a\r\nview of calling the attention of Congress to the possible modifications\r\nof a system which can not continue to exist in its present form without\r\noccasional collisions with the local authorities and perpetual\r\napprehensions and discontent on the part of the States and the people.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, fellow citizens, allow me to invoke in behalf of your\r\ndeliberations that spirit of conciliation and disinterestedness which\r\nis the gift of patriotism. Under an over-ruling and merciful Providence\r\nthe agency of this spirit has thus far been signalized in the\r\nprosperity and glory of our beloved country. May its influence be\r\neternal.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nAndrew Jackson\r\nDecember 6, 1831\r\n\r\nFellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe representation of the people has been renewed for the 22nd time\r\nsince the Constitution they formed has been in force. For near half a\r\ncentury the Chief Magistrates who have been successively chosen have\r\nmade their annual communications of the state of the nation to its\r\nrepresentatives. Generally these communications have been of the most\r\ngratifying nature, testifying an advance in all the improvements of\r\nsocial and all the securities of political life. But frequently and\r\njustly as you have been called on to be grateful for the bounties of\r\nProvidence, at few periods have they been more abundantly or\r\nextensively bestowed than at the present; rarely, if ever, have we had\r\ngreater reason to congratulate each other on the continued and\r\nincreasing prosperity of our beloved country.\r\n\r\nAgriculture, the first and most important occupation of man, has\r\ncompensated the labors of the husband-man with plentiful crops of all\r\nthe varied products of our extensive country. Manufactures have been\r\nestablished in which the funds of the capitalist find a profitable\r\ninvestment, and which give employment and subsistence to a numerous and\r\nincreasing body of industrious and dexterous mechanics. The laborer is\r\nrewarded by high wages in the construction of works of internal\r\nimprovement, which are extending with unprecedented rapidity. Science\r\nis steadily penetrating the recesses of nature and disclosing her\r\nsecrets, while the ingenuity of free minds is subjecting the elements\r\nto the power of man and making each new conquest auxiliary to his\r\ncomfort. By our mails, whose speed is regularly increased and whose\r\nroutes are every year extended, the communication of public\r\nintelligence and private business is rendered frequent and safe; the\r\nintercourse between distant cities, which it formerly required weeks to\r\naccomplish, is now effected in a few days; and in the construction of\r\nrail roads and the application of steam power we have a reasonable\r\nprospect that the extreme parts of our country will be so much\r\napproximated and those most isolated by the obstacles of nature\r\nrendered so accessible as to remove an apprehension some times\r\nentertained that the great extent of the Union would endanger its\r\npermanent existence.\r\n\r\nIf from the satisfactory view of our agriculture, manufactures, and\r\ninternal improvements we turn to the state of our navigation and trade\r\nwith foreign nations and between the States, we shall scarcely find\r\nless cause for gratulation. A beneficent Providence has provided for\r\ntheir exercise and encouragement an extensive coast, indented by\r\ncapacious bays, noble rivers, inland seas; with a country productive of\r\nevery material for ship building and every commodity for gainful\r\ncommerce, and filled with a population active, intelligent,\r\nwell-informed, and fearless of danger. These advantages are not\r\nneglected, and an impulse has lately been given to commercial\r\nenterprise, which fills our ship yards with new constructions,\r\nencourages all the arts and branches of industry connected with them,\r\ncrowds the wharves of our cities with vessels, and covers the most\r\ndistant seas with our canvas.\r\n\r\nLet us be grateful for these blessings to the beneficent Being who has\r\nconferred them, and who suffers us to indulge a reasonable hope of\r\ntheir continuance and extension, while we neglect not the means by\r\nwhich they may be preserved. If we may dare to judge of His future\r\ndesigns by the manner in which His past favors have been bestowed, He\r\nhas made our national prosperity to depend on the preservation of our\r\nliberties, our national force on our Federal Union, and our individual\r\nhappiness on the maintenance of our State rights and wise institutions.\r\nIf we are prosperous at home and respected abroad, it is because we are\r\nfree, united, industrious, and obedient to the laws. While we continue\r\nso we shall by the blessing of Heaven go on in the happy career we have\r\nbegun, and which has brought us in the short period of our political\r\nexistence from a population of 3,000,000 to 13,000,000; from 13\r\nseparate colonies to 24 united States; from weakness to strength; from\r\na rank scarcely marked in the scale of nations to a high place in their\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nThis last advantage is one that has resulted in a great degree from the\r\nprinciples which have guided our intercourse with foreign powers since\r\nwe have assumed an equal station among them, and hence the annual\r\naccount which the Executive renders to the country of the manner in\r\nwhich that branch of his duties has been fulfilled proves instructive\r\nand salutary.\r\n\r\nThe pacific and wise policy of our Government kept us in a state of\r\nneutrality during the wars that have at different periods since our\r\npolitical existence been carried on by other powers; but this policy,\r\nwhile it gave activity and extent to our commerce, exposed it in the\r\nsame proportion to injuries from the belligerent nations. Hence have\r\narisen claims of indemnity for those injuries. England, France, Spain,\r\nHolland, Sweden, Denmark, Naples, and lately Portugal had all in a\r\ngreater or less degree infringed our neutral rights. Demands for\r\nreparation were made upon all. They have had in all, and continue to\r\nhave in some, cases a leading influence on the nature of our relations\r\nwith the powers on whom they were made.\r\n\r\nOf the claims upon England it is unnecessary to speak further than to\r\nsay that the state of things to which their prosecution and denial gave\r\nrise has been succeeded by arrangements productive of mutual good\r\nfeeling and amicable relations between the two countries, which it is\r\nhoped will not be interrupted. One of these arrangements is that\r\nrelating to the colonial trade which was communicated to Congress at\r\nthe last session; and although the short period during which it has\r\nbeen in force will not enable me to form an accurate judgment of its\r\noperation, there is every reason to believe that it will prove highly\r\nbeneficial. The trade thereby authorized has employed to September\r\n30th, 1831 upward of 30 thousand tons of American and 15 thousand tons\r\nof foreign shipping in the outward voyages, and in the inward nearly an\r\nequal amount of American and 20 thousand only of foreign tonnage.\r\nAdvantages, too, have resulted to our agricultural interests from the\r\nstate of the trade between Canada and our Territories and States\r\nbordering or the St. Lawrence and the Lakes which may prove more than\r\nequivalent to the loss sustained by the discrimination made to favor\r\nthe trade of the northern colonies with the West Indies.\r\n\r\nAfter our transition from the state of colonies to that of an\r\nindependent nation many points were found necessary to be settled\r\nbetween us and Great Britain. Among them was the demarcation of\r\nboundaries not described with sufficient precision in the treaty of\r\npeace. Some of the lines that divide the States and Territories of the\r\nUnited States from the British Provinces have been definitively fixed.\r\n\r\nThat, however, which separates us from the Provinces of Canada and New\r\nBrunswick to the North and the East was still in dispute when I came\r\ninto office, but I found arrangements made for its settlement over\r\nwhich I had no control. The commissioners who had been appointed under\r\nthe provisions of the treaty of Ghent having been unable to agree, a\r\nconvention was made with Great Britain by my immediate predecessor in\r\noffice, with the advice and consent of the Senate, by which it was\r\nagreed \"that the points of difference which have arisen in the\r\nsettlement of the boundary line between the American and British\r\ndominions, as described in the 5th article of the treaty of Ghent,\r\nshall be referred, as therein provided, to some friendly sovereign or\r\nState, who shall be invited to investigate and make a decision upon\r\nsuch points of difference\"; and the King of the Netherlands having by\r\nthe late President and His Britannic Majesty been designated as such\r\nfriendly sovereign, it became my duty to carry with good faith the\r\nagreement so made into full effect. To this end I caused all the\r\nmeasures to be taken which were necessary to a full exposition of our\r\ncase to the sovereign arbiter, and nominated as minister\r\nplenipotentiary to his Court a distinguished citizen of the State most\r\ninterested in the question, and who had been one of the agents\r\npreviously employed for settling the controversy.\r\n\r\nOn January 10th, 1831 His Majesty the King of the Netherlands delivered\r\nto the plenipotentiaries of the United States and of Great Britain his\r\nwritten opinion on the case referred to him. The papers in relation to\r\nthe subject will be communicated by a special message to the proper\r\nbranch of the Government with the perfect confidence that its wisdom\r\nwill adopt such measures as will secure an amicable settlement of the\r\ncontroversy without infringing any constitutional right of the States\r\nimmediately interested.\r\n\r\nIt affords me satisfaction to inform you that suggestions made by my\r\ndirection to the charge d'affaires of His Britannic Majesty to this\r\nGovernment have had their desired effect in producing the release of\r\ncertain American citizens who were imprisoned for setting up the\r\nauthority of the State of Maine at a place in the disputed territory\r\nunder the actual jurisdiction of His Britannic Majesty. From this and\r\nthe assurances I have received of the desire of the local authorities\r\nto avoid any cause of collision I have the best hopes that a good\r\nunderstanding will be kept up until it is confirmed by the final\r\ndisposition of the subject.\r\n\r\nThe amicable relations which now subsist between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain, the increasing intercourse between their citizens, and\r\nthe rapid obliteration of unfriendly prejudices to which former events\r\nnaturally gave rise concurred to present this as a fit period for\r\nrenewing our endeavors to provide against the recurrence of causes of\r\nirritation which in the event of war between Great Britain and any\r\nother power would inevitably endanger our peace. Animated by the\r\nsincerest desire to avoid such a state of things, and peacefully to\r\nsecure under all possible circumstances the rights and honor of the\r\ncountry, I have given such instructions to the minister lately sent to\r\nthe Court of London as will evince that desire, and if met by a\r\ncorrespondent disposition, which we can not doubt, will put an end to\r\ncauses of collision which, without advantage to either, tend to\r\nestrange from each other two nations who have every motive to preserve\r\nnot only peace, but an intercourse of the most amicable nature.\r\n\r\nIn my message at the opening of the last session of Congress I\r\nexpressed a confident hope that the justice of our claims upon France,\r\nurged as they were with perseverance and signal ability by our minister\r\nthere, would finally be acknowledged. This hope has been realized. A\r\ntreaty has been signed which will immediately be laid before the Senate\r\nfor its approbation, and which, containing stipulations that require\r\nlegislative acts, must have the concurrence of both houses before it\r\ncan be carried into effect.\r\n\r\nBy it the French Government engage to pay a sum which, if not quite\r\nequal to that which may be found due to our citizens, will yet, it is\r\nbelieved, under all circumstances, be deemed satisfactory by those\r\ninterested. The offer of a gross sum instead of the satisfaction of\r\neach individual claim was accepted because the only alternatives were a\r\nrigorous exaction of the whole amount stated to be due on each claim,\r\nwhich might in some instances be exaggerated by design, in other\r\nover-rated through error, and which, therefore, it would have been both\r\nungracious and unjust to have insisted on; or a settlement by a mixed\r\ncommission, to which the French negotiators were very averse, and which\r\nexperience in other cases had shewn to be dilatory and often wholly\r\ninadequate to the end.\r\n\r\nA comparatively small sum is stipulated on our part to go to the\r\nextinction of all claims by French citizens on our Government, and a\r\nreduction of duties on our cotton and their wines has been agreed on as\r\na consideration for the renunciation of an important claim for\r\ncommercial privileges under the construction they gave to the treaty\r\nfor the cession of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nShould this treaty receive the proper sanction, a source of irritation\r\nwill be stopped that has for so many years in some degree alienated\r\nfrom each other two nations who, from interest as well as the\r\nremembrance of early associations, ought to cherish the most friendly\r\nrelations; an encouragement will be given for perseverance in the\r\ndemands of justice by this new proof that if steadily pursued they will\r\nbe listened to, and admonition will be offered to those powers, if any,\r\nwhich may be inclined to evade them that they will never be abandoned;\r\nabove all, a just confidence will be inspired in our fellow citizens\r\nthat their Government will exert all the powers with which they have\r\ninvested it in support of their just claims upon foreign nations; at\r\nthe same time that the frank acknowledgment and provision for the\r\npayment of those which were addressed to our equity, although\r\nunsupported by legal proof, affords a practical illustration of our\r\nsubmission to the divine rule of doing to others what we desire they\r\nshould do unto us.\r\n\r\nSweden and Denmark having made compensation for the irregularities\r\ncommitted by their vessels or in their ports to the perfect\r\nsatisfaction of the parties concerned, and having renewed the treaties\r\nof commerce entered into with them, our political and commercial\r\nrelations with those powers continue to be on the most friendly\r\nfooting.\r\n\r\nWith Spain our differences up to February 22d, 1819 were settled by the\r\ntreaty of Washington of that date, but at a subsequent period our\r\ncommerce with the States formerly colonies of Spain on the continent of\r\nAmerica was annoyed and frequently interrupted by her public and\r\nprivate armed ships. They captured many of our vessels prosecuting a\r\nlawful commerce and sold them and their cargoes, and at one time to our\r\ndemands for restoration and indemnity opposed the allegation that they\r\nwere taken in the violation of a blockade of all the ports of those\r\nStates. This blockade was declaratory only, and the inadequacy of the\r\nforce to maintain it was so manifest that this allegation was varied to\r\na charge of trade in contraband of war. This, in its turn, was also\r\nfound untenable, and the minister whom I sent with instructions to\r\npress for the reparation that was due to our injured fellow citizens\r\nhas transmitted an answer to his demand by which the captures are\r\ndeclared to have been legal, and are justified because the independence\r\nof the States of America never having been acknowledged by Spain she\r\nhad a right to prohibit trade with them under her old colonial laws.\r\nThis ground of defense was contradictory, not only to those which had\r\nbeen formerly alleged, but to the uniform practice and established laws\r\nof nations, and had been abandoned by Spain herself in the convention\r\nwhich granted indemnity to British subjects for captures made at the\r\nsame time, under the same circumstances, and for the same allegations\r\nwith those of which we complain.\r\n\r\nI, however, indulge the hope that further reflection will lead to other\r\nviews, and feel confident that when His Catholic Majesty shall be\r\nconvinced of the justice of the claims his desire to preserve friendly\r\nrelations between the two countries, which it is my earnest endeavor to\r\nmaintain, will induce him to accede to our demand. I have therefore\r\ndispatched a special messenger with instructions to our minister to\r\nbring the case once more to his consideration, to the end that if\r\n(which I can not bring myself to believe) the same decision (that can\r\nnot but be deemed an unfriendly denial of justice) should be persisted\r\nin the matter may before your adjournment be laid before you, the\r\nconstitutional judges of what is proper to be done when negotiation for\r\nredress of injury fails.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of a treaty for indemnity with France seemed to present\r\na favorable opportunity to renew our claims of a similar nature on\r\nother powers, and particularly in the case of those upon Naples, more\r\nespecially as in the course of former negotiations with that power our\r\nfailure to induce France to render us justice was used as an argument\r\nagainst us. The desires of the merchants, who were the principal\r\nsufferers, have therefore been acceded to, and a mission has been\r\ninstituted for the special purpose of obtaining for them a reparation\r\nalready too long delayed. This measure having been resolved on, it was\r\nput in execution without waiting for the meeting of Congress, because\r\nthe state of Europe created an apprehension of events that might have\r\nrendered our application ineffectual.\r\n\r\nOur demands upon the Government of the two Sicilies are of a peculiar\r\nnature. The injuries on which they are founded are not denied, nor are\r\nthe atrocity and perfidy under which those injuries were perpetrated\r\nattempted to be extenuated. The sole ground on which indemnity has been\r\nrefused is the alleged illegality of the tenure by which the monarch\r\nwho made the seizures held his crown. This defense, always unfounded in\r\nany principle of the law of nations, now universally abandoned, even by\r\nthose powers upon whom the responsibility for the acts of past rulers\r\nbore the most heavily, will unquestionably be given up by His Sicilian\r\nMajesty, whose counsels will receive an impulse from that high sense of\r\nhonor and regard to justice which are said to characterize him; and I\r\nfeel the fullest confidence that the talents of the citizen\r\ncommissioned for that purpose will place before him the just claims of\r\nour injured citizens in such as light as will enable me before your\r\nadjournment to announce that they have been adjusted and secured.\r\nPrecise instructions to the effect of bringing the negotiation to a\r\nspeedy issue have been given, and will be obeyed.\r\n\r\nIn the late blockade of Terceira some of the Portuguese fleet captured\r\nseveral of our vessels and committed other excesses, for which\r\nreparation was demanded, and I was on the point of dispatching an armed\r\nforce to prevent any recurrence of a similar violence and protect our\r\ncitizens in the prosecution of their lawful commerce when official\r\nassurances, on which I relied, made the sailing of the ships\r\nunnecessary. Since that period frequent promises have been made that\r\nfull indemnity shall be given for the injuries inflicted and the losses\r\nsustained. In the performance there has been some, perhaps unavoidable,\r\ndelay; but I have the fullest confidence that my earnest desire that\r\nthis business may at once be closed, which our minister has been\r\ninstructed strongly to express, will very soon be gratified. I have the\r\nbetter ground for this hope from the evidence of a friendly disposition\r\nwhich that Government has shown an actual reduction in the duty on rice\r\nthe produce of our Southern States, authorizing the anticipation that\r\nthis important article of our export will soon be admitted on the same\r\nfooting with that produced by the most favored nation.\r\n\r\nWith the other powers of Europe we have fortunately had no cause of\r\ndiscussions for the redress of injuries. With the Empire of the Russias\r\nour political connection is of the most friendly and our commercial of\r\nthe most liberal kind. We enjoy the advantages of navigation and trade\r\ngiven to the most favored nation, but it has not yet suited their\r\npolicy, or perhaps has not been found convenient from other\r\nconsiderations, to give stability and reciprocity to those privileges\r\nby a commercial treaty. The ill health of the minister last year\r\ncharged with making a proposition for that arrangement did not permit\r\nhim to remain at St. Petersburg, and the attention of that Government\r\nduring the whole of the period since his departure having been occupied\r\nby the war in which it was engaged, we have been assured that nothing\r\ncould have been effected by his presence. A minister will soon be\r\nnominated, as well to effect this important object as to keep up the\r\nrelations of amity and good understanding of which we have received so\r\nmany assurances and proofs from His Imperial Majesty and the Emperor\r\nhis predecessor.\r\n\r\nThe treaty with Austria is opening to us an important trade with the\r\nhereditary dominions of the Emperor, the value of which has been\r\nhitherto little known, and of course not sufficiently appreciated.\r\nWhile our commerce finds an entrance into the south of Germany by means\r\nof this treaty, those we have formed with the Hanseatic towns and\r\nPrussia and others now in negotiation will open that vast country to\r\nthe enterprising spirit of our merchants on the north--a country\r\nabounding in all the materials for a mutually beneficial commerce,\r\nfilled with enlightened and industrious inhabitants, holding an\r\nimportant place in the politics of Europe, and to which we owe so many\r\nvaluable citizens. The ratification of the treaty with the Porte was\r\nsent to be exchanged by the gentleman appointed our charge d'affaires\r\nto that Court. Some difficulties occurred on his arrival, but at the\r\ndate of his last official dispatch he supposed they had been obviated\r\nand that there was every prospect of the exchange being speedily\r\neffected.\r\n\r\nThis finishes the connected view I have thought it proper to give of\r\nour political and commercial relations in Europe. Every effort in my\r\npower will be continued to strengthen and extend them by treaties\r\nfounded on principles of the most perfect reciprocity of interest,\r\nneither asking nor conceding any exclusive advantage, but liberating as\r\nfar as it lies in my power the activity and industry of our fellow\r\ncitizens from the shackles which foreign restrictions may impose.\r\n\r\nTo China and the East Indies our commerce continues in its usual\r\nextent, and with increased facilities which the credit and capital of\r\nour merchants afford by substituting bills for payments in specie. A\r\ndaring outrage having been committed in those seas by the plunder of\r\none of our merchant-men engaged in the pepper trade at a port in\r\nSumatra, and the piratical perpetrators belonging to tribes in such a\r\nstate of society that the usual course of proceedings between civilized\r\nnations could not be pursued, I forthwith dispatched a frigate with\r\norders to require immediate satisfaction for the injury and indemnity\r\nto the sufferers.\r\n\r\nFew changes have taken place in our connections with the independent\r\nStates of America since my last communication to Congress. The\r\nratification of a commercial treaty with the United Republics of Mexico\r\nhas been for some time under deliberation in their Congress, but was\r\nstill undecided at the date of our last dispatches. The unhappy civil\r\ncommotions that have prevailed there were undoubtedly the cause of the\r\ndelay, but as the Government is now said to be tranquillized we may\r\nhope soon to receive the ratification of the treaty and an arrangement\r\nfor the demarcation of the boundaries between us. In the mean time, an\r\nimportant trade has been opened with mutual benefit from St. Louis, in\r\nthe State of Missouri, by caravans to the interior Provinces of Mexico.\r\nThis commerce is protected in its progress through the Indian countries\r\nby the troops of the United States, which have been permitted to escort\r\nthe caravans beyond our boundaries to the settled part of the Mexican\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nFrom Central America I have received assurances of the most friendly\r\nkind and a gratifying application for our good offices to remove a\r\nsupposed indisposition toward that Government in a neighboring State.\r\nThis application was immediately and successfully complied with. They\r\ngave us also the pleasing intelligence that differences which had\r\nprevailed in their internal affairs had been peaceably adjusted. Our\r\ntreaty with this Republic continues to be faithfully observed, and\r\npromises a great and beneficial commerce between the two countries--a\r\ncommerce of the greatest importance if the magnificent project of a\r\nship canal through the dominions of that State from the Atlantic to the\r\nPacific Ocean, now in serious contemplation, shall be executed.\r\n\r\nI have great satisfaction in communicating the success which has\r\nattended the exertions of our minister in Colombia to procure a very\r\nconsiderable reduction in the duties on our flour in that Republic.\r\nIndemnity also has been stipulated for injuries received by our\r\nmerchants from illegal seizures, and renewed assurances are given that\r\nthe treaty between the two countries shall be faithfully observed.\r\n\r\nChili and Peru seem to be still threatened with civil commotions, and\r\nuntil they shall be settled disorders may naturally be apprehended,\r\nrequiring the constant presence of a naval force in the Pacific Ocean\r\nto protect our fisheries and guard our commerce.\r\n\r\nThe disturbances that took place in the Empire of Brazil previously to\r\nand immediately consequent upon the abdication of the late Emperor\r\nnecessarily suspended any effectual application for the redress of some\r\npast injuries suffered by our citizens from that Government, while they\r\nhave been the cause of others, in which all foreigners seem to have\r\nparticipated. Instructions have been given to our minister there to\r\npress for indemnity due for losses occasioned by these irregularities,\r\nand to take care of our fellow citizens shall enjoy all the privileges\r\nstipulated in their favor by the treaty lately made between the two\r\npowers, all which the good intelligence that prevails between our\r\nminister at Rio Janeiro and the Regency gives us the best reason to\r\nexpect.\r\n\r\nI should have placed Buenos Ayres in the list of South American powers\r\nin respect to which nothing of importance affecting us was to be\r\ncommunicated but for occurrences which have lately taken place at the\r\nFalkland Islands, in which the name of that Republic has been used to\r\ncover with a show of authority acts injurious to our commerce and to\r\nthe property and liberty of our fellow citizens. In the course of the\r\npresent year one of our vessels, engaged in the pursuit of a trade\r\nwhich we have always enjoyed without molestation, has been captured by\r\na band acting, as they pretend, under the authority of the Government\r\nof Buenos Ayres. I have therefore given orders for the dispatch of an\r\narmed vessel to join our squadron in those seas and aid in affording\r\nall lawful protection to our trade which shall be necessary, and shall\r\nwithout delay send a minister to inquire into the nature of the\r\ncircumstances and also of the claim, if any, that is set up by that\r\nGovernment to those islands. In the mean time, I submit the case to the\r\nconsideration of Congress, to the end that they may clothe the\r\nExecutive with such authority and means as they may deem necessary for\r\nproviding a force adequate to the complete protection of our fellow\r\ncitizens fishing and trading in those seas.\r\n\r\nThis rapid sketch of our foreign relations, it is hoped, fellow\r\ncitizens, may be of some use in so much of your legislation as may bear\r\non that important subject, while it affords to the country at large a\r\nsource of high gratification in the contemplation of our political and\r\ncommercial connection with the rest of the world. At peace with all;\r\nhaving subjects of future difference with few, and those susceptible of\r\neasy adjustment; extending our commerce gradually on all sides and on\r\nnone by any but the most liberal and mutually beneficial means, we may,\r\nby the blessing of Providence, hope for all that national prosperity\r\nwhich can be derived from an intercourse with foreign nations, guided\r\nby those eternal principles of justice and reciprocal good will which\r\nare binding as well upon States as the individuals of whom they are\r\ncomposed.\r\n\r\nI have great satisfaction in making this statement of our affairs,\r\nbecause the course of our national policy enables me to do it without\r\nany indiscreet exposure of what in other governments is usually\r\nconcealed from the people. Having none but a straight-forward, open\r\ncourse to pursue, guided by a single principle that will bear the\r\nstrongest light, we have happily no political combinations to form, no\r\nalliances to entangle us, no complicated interests to consult, and in\r\nsubjecting all we have done to the consideration of our citizens and to\r\nthe inspection of the world we give no advantage to other nations and\r\nlay ourselves open to no injury.\r\n\r\nIt may not be improper to add that to preserve this state of things and\r\ngive confidence to the world in the integrity of our designs all our\r\nconsular and diplomatic agents are strictly enjoined to examine well\r\nevery cause of complaint preferred by our citizens, and while they urge\r\nwith proper earnestness those that are well founded, to countenance\r\nnone that are unreasonable or unjust, and to enjoin on our merchants\r\nand navigators the strictest obedience to the laws of the countries to\r\nwhich they resort, and a course of conduct in their dealings that may\r\nsupport the character of our nation and render us respected abroad.\r\n\r\nConnected with this subject, I must recommend a revisal of our consular\r\nlaws. Defects and omissions have been discovered in their operation\r\nthat ought to be remedied and supplied. For your further information on\r\nthis subject I have directed a report to be made by the Secretary of\r\nState, which I shall hereafter submit to your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe internal peace and security of our confederated States is the next\r\nprincipal object of the General Government. Time and experience have\r\nproved that the abode of the native Indian within their limits is\r\ndangerous to their peace and injurious to himself. In accordance with\r\nmy recommendation at a former session of Congress, an appropriation of\r\n$500 thousand was made to aid the voluntary removal of the various\r\ntribes beyond the limits of the States. At the last session I had the\r\nhappiness to announce that the Chickasaws and Choctaws had accepted the\r\ngenerous offer of the Government and agreed to remove beyond the\r\nMississippi River, by which the whole of the State of Mississippi and\r\nthe western part of Alabama will be freed from Indian occupancy and\r\nopened to a civilized population. The treaties with these tribes are in\r\na course of execution, and their removal, it is hoped, will be\r\ncompleted in the course of 1832.\r\n\r\nAt the request of the authorities of Georgia the registration of\r\nCherokee Indians for emigration has been resumed, and it is confidently\r\nexpected that half, if not two-third, of that tribe will follow the\r\nwise example of their more westerly brethren. Those who prefer\r\nremaining at their present homes will hereafter be governed by the laws\r\nof Georgia, as all her citizens are, and cease to be the objects of\r\npeculiar care on the part of the General Government.\r\n\r\nDuring the present year the attention of the Government has been\r\nparticularly directed to those tribes in the powerful and growing State\r\nof Ohio, where considerable tracts of the finest lands were still\r\noccupied by the aboriginal proprietors. Treaties, either absolute or\r\nconditional, have been made extinguishing the whole Indian title to the\r\nreservations in that State, and the time is not distant, it is hoped,\r\nwhen Ohio will be no longer embarrassed with the Indian population. The\r\nsame measures will be extended to Indiana as soon as there is reason to\r\nanticipate success. It is confidently believed that perseverance for a\r\nfew years in the present policy of the Government will extinguish the\r\nIndian title to all lands lying within the States composing our Federal\r\nUnion, and remove beyond their limits every Indian who is not willing\r\nto submit to their laws.\r\n\r\nThus will all conflicting claims to jurisdiction between the States and\r\nthe Indian tribes be put to rest. It is pleasing to reflect that\r\nresults so beneficial, not only to the States immediately concerned,\r\nbut to the harmony of the Union, will have been accomplished by\r\nmeasures equally advantageous to the Indians. What the native savages\r\nbecome when surrounded by a dense population and by mixing with the\r\nwhites may be seen in the miserable remnants of a few Eastern tribes,\r\ndeprived of political and civil rights, forbidden to make contracts,\r\nand subjected to guardians, dragging out a wretched existence, without\r\nexcitement, without hope, and almost without thought.\r\n\r\nBut the removal of the Indians beyond the limits and jurisdiction of\r\nthe States does not place them beyond the reach of philanthropic aid\r\nand Christian instruction. On the contrary, those whom philanthropy or\r\nreligion may induce to live among them in their new abode will be more\r\nfree in the exercise of their benevolent functions than if they had\r\nremained within the limits of the States, embarrassed by their internal\r\nregulations. Now subject to no control but the superintending agency of\r\nthe General Government, exercised with the sole view of preserving\r\npeace, they may proceed unmolested in the interesting experiment of\r\ngradually advancing a community of American Indians from barbarism to\r\nthe habits and enjoyments of civilized life.\r\n\r\nAmong the happiest effects of the improved relations of our Republic\r\nhas been an increase of trade, producing a corresponding increase of\r\nrevenue beyond the most sanguine anticipations of the Treasury\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nThe state of the public finances will be fully shown by the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury in the report which he will presently lay before you. I\r\nwill here, however, congratulate you upon their prosperous condition.\r\nThe revenue received in the present year will not fall short of\r\n$27,700,000, and the expenditures for all objects other than the public\r\ndebt will not exceed $14,700,000. The payment on account of the\r\nprincipal and interest of the debt during the year will exceed\r\n$16,500,000, a greater sum than has been applied to that object out of\r\nthe revenue in any year since the enlargement of the sinking fund\r\nexcept the two years following immediately there after. The amount\r\nwhich will have been applied to the public debt from March 4th, 1829 to\r\nJanuary 1st, 1832, which is less than three years since the\r\nAdministration has been placed in my hands, will exceed $40,000,000.\r\n\r\nFrom the large importations of the present year it may be safely\r\nestimated that the revenue which will be received into the Treasury\r\nfrom that source during the next year, with the aid of that received\r\nfrom the public lands, will considerably exceed the amount of the\r\nreceipts of the present year; and it is believed that with the means\r\nwhich the Government will have at its disposal from various sources,\r\nwhich will be fully stated by the proper Department, the whole of the\r\npublic debt may be extinguished, either by redemption or purchase,\r\nwithin the four years of my Administration. We shall then exhibit the\r\nrare example of a great nation, abounding in all the means of happiness\r\nand security, altogether free from debt.\r\n\r\nThe confidence with which the extinguishment of the public debt may be\r\nanticipated presents an opportunity for carrying into effect more fully\r\nthe policy in relation to import duties which has been recommended in\r\nmy former messages. A modification of the tariff which shall produce a\r\nreduction of our revenue to the wants of the Government and an\r\nadjustment of the duties on imports with a view to equal justice in\r\nrelation to all our national interests and to the counteraction of\r\nforeign policy so far as it may be injurious to those interests, is\r\ndeemed to be one of the principal objects which demand the\r\nconsideration of the present Congress. Justice to the interests of the\r\nmerchant as well as the manufacturer requires that material reductions\r\nin the import duties be prospective; and unless the present Congress\r\nshall dispose of the subject the proposed reductions can not properly\r\nbe made to take effect at the period when the necessity for the revenue\r\narising from present rates shall cease. It is therefore desirable that\r\narrangements be adopted at your present session to relieve the people\r\nfrom unnecessary taxation after the extinguishment of the public debt.\r\nIn the exercise of that spirit of concession and conciliation which has\r\ndistinguished the friends of our Union in all great emergencies, it is\r\nbelieved that this object may be effected without injury to any\r\nnational interest.\r\n\r\nIn my annual message of December, 1829, I had the honor to recommend\r\nthe adoption of a more liberal policy than that which then prevailed\r\ntoward unfortunate debtors to the Government, and I deem it my duty\r\nagain to invite your attention to this subject.\r\n\r\nActuated by similar views, Congress at their last session passed an act\r\nfor the relief of certain insolvent debtors of the United States, but\r\nthe provisions of that law have not been deemed such as were adequate\r\nto that relief to this unfortunate class of our fellow citizens which\r\nmay be safely extended to them. The points in which the law appears to\r\nbe defective will be particularly communicated by the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, and I take pleasure in recommending such an extension of its\r\nprovisions as will unfetter the enterprise of a valuable portion of our\r\ncitizens and restore to them the means of usefulness to themselves and\r\nthe community. While deliberating on this subject I would also\r\nrecommend to your consideration the propriety of so modifying the laws\r\nfor enforcing the payment of debts due either to the public or to\r\nindividuals suing in the courts of the United States as to restrict the\r\nimprisonment of the person to cases of fraudulent concealment of\r\nproperty. The personal liberty of the citizen seems too sacred to be\r\nheld, as in many cases it now is, at the will of a creditor to whom he\r\nis willing to surrender all the means he has of discharging his debt.\r\n\r\nThe reports from the Secretaries of the War and Navy Departments and\r\nfrom the Post Master General, which accompany this message, present\r\nsatisfactory views of the operations of the Departments respectively\r\nunder their charge, and suggest improvements which are worthy of and to\r\nwhich I invite the serious attention of Congress. Certain defects and\r\nomissions having been discovered in the operation of the laws\r\nrespecting patents, they are pointed out in the accompanying report\r\nfrom the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nI have heretofore recommended amendments of the Federal Constitution\r\ngiving the election of President and Vice-President to the people and\r\nlimiting the service of the former to a single term. So important do I\r\nconsider these changes in our fundamental law that I can not, in\r\naccordance with my sense of duty, omit to press them upon the\r\nconsideration of a new Congress. For my views more at large, as well in\r\nrelation to these points as to the disqualification of members of\r\nCongress to receive an office from a President in whose election they\r\nhave had an official agency, which I proposed as a substitute, I refer\r\nyou to my former messages.\r\n\r\nOur system of public accounts is extremely complicated, and it is\r\nbelieved may be much improved. Much of the present machinery and a\r\nconsiderable portion of the expenditure of public money may be\r\ndispensed with, while greater facilities can be afforded to the\r\nliquidation of claims upon the Government and an examination into their\r\njustice and legality quite as efficient as the present secured. With a\r\nview to a general reform in the system, I recommend the subject to the\r\nattention of Congress.\r\n\r\nI deem it my duty again to call your attention to the condition of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia. It was doubtless wise in the framers of our\r\nConstitution to place the people of this District under the\r\njurisdiction of the General Government, but to accomplish the objects\r\nthey had in view it is not necessary that this people should be\r\ndeprived of all the privileges of self-government. Independently of the\r\ndifficulty of inducing the representatives of distant States to turn\r\ntheir attention to projects of laws which are not of the highest\r\ninterest to their constituents, they are not individually, nor in\r\nCongress collectively, well qualified to legislate over the local\r\nconcerns of this District. Consequently its interests are much\r\nneglected, and the people are almost afraid to present their\r\ngrievances, lest a body in which they are not represented and which\r\nfeels little sympathy in their local relations should in its attempt to\r\nmake laws for them do more harm than good.\r\n\r\nGoverned by the laws of the States whence they were severed, the two\r\nshores of the Potomac within the ten miles square have different penal\r\ncodes--not the present codes of Virginia and Maryland, but such as\r\nexisted in those States at the time of the cession to the United\r\nStates. As Congress will not form a new code, and as the people of the\r\nDistrict can not make one for themselves, they are virtually under two\r\ngovernments. Is it not just to allow them at least a Delegate in\r\nCongress, if not a local legislature, to make laws for the District,\r\nsubject to the approval or rejection of Congress? I earnestly recommend\r\nthe extension to them of every political right which their interests\r\nrequire and which may be compatible with the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe extension of the judiciary system of the United States is deemed to\r\nbe one of the duties of the Government. One-fourth of the States in the\r\nUnion do not participate in the benefits of a circuit court. To the\r\nStates of Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Alabama, Mississippi, and\r\nLouisiana, admitted into the Union since the present judicial system\r\nwas organized, only a district court has been allowed. If this be\r\nsufficient, then the circuit courts already existing in 18 States ought\r\nto be abolished; if it be not sufficient, the defect ought to be\r\nremedied, and these States placed on the same footing with the other\r\nmembers of the Union. It was on this condition and on this footing that\r\nthey entered the Union, and they may demand circuit courts as a matter\r\nnot of concession, but of right. I trust that Congress will not adjourn\r\nleaving this anomaly in our system.\r\n\r\nEntertaining the opinions heretofore expressed in relation to the Bank\r\nof the United States as at present organized, I felt it my duty in my\r\nformer messages frankly to disclose them, in order that the attention\r\nof the Legislature and the people should be seasonably directed to that\r\nimportant subject, and that it might be considered and finally disposed\r\nof in a manner best calculated to promote the ends of the Constitution\r\nand subserve the public interests. Having thus conscientiously\r\ndischarged a constitutional duty, I deem it proper on this occasion,\r\nwithout a more particular reference to the views of the subject then\r\nexpressed to leave it for the present to the investigation of an\r\nenlightened people and their representatives.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion permit me to invoke that Power which superintends all\r\ngovernments to infuse into your deliberations at this important crisis\r\nof our history a spirit of mutual forbearance and conciliation. In that\r\nspirit was our Union formed, and in that spirit must it be preserved.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nAndrew Jackson\r\nDecember 4, 1832\r\n\r\nFellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nIt gives me pleasure to congratulate you upon your return to the seat\r\nof Government for the purpose of discharging your duties to the people\r\nof the United States. Although the pestilence which had traversed the\r\nOld World has entered our limits and extended its ravages over much of\r\nour land, it has pleased Almighty God to mitigate its severity and\r\nlessen the number of its victims compared with those who have fallen in\r\nmost other countries over which it has spread its terrors. Not with\r\nstanding this visitation, our country presents on every side marks of\r\nprosperity and happiness unequaled, perhaps, in any other portion of\r\nthe world. If we fully appreciate our comparative condition, existing\r\ncauses of discontent will appear unworthy of attention, and, with\r\nhearts of thankfulness to that divine Being who has filled our cup of\r\nprosperity, we shall feel our resolution strengthened to preserve and\r\nhand down to our posterity that liberty and that union which we have\r\nreceived from our fathers, and which constitute the sources and the\r\nshield of all our blessings.\r\n\r\nThe relations of our country continue to present the same picture of\r\namicable intercourse that I had the satisfaction to hold up to your\r\nview at the opening of your last session. The same friendly\r\nprofessions, the same desire to participate in our flourishing\r\ncommerce, the same dispositions, evinced by all nations with whom we\r\nhave any intercourse. This desirable state of things may be mainly\r\nascribed to our undeviating practice of the rule which has long guided\r\nour national policy, to require no exclusive privileges in commerce and\r\nto grant none. It is daily producing its beneficial effect in the\r\nrespect shown to our flag, the protection of our citizens and their\r\nproperty abroad, and in the increase of our navigation and the\r\nextension of our mercantile operations. The returns which have been\r\nmade out since we last met will show an increase during the last\r\npreceding year of more than 80 thousand tons in our shipping and of\r\nnear $40,000,000 in the aggregate of our imports and exports.\r\n\r\nNor have we less reason to felicitate ourselves on the position of our\r\npolitical than of our commercial concerns. They remain in the state in\r\nwhich they were when I last addressed you--a state of prosperity and\r\npeace, the effect of a wise attention to the parting advice of the\r\nrevered Father of his Country on this subject, condensed into a maxim\r\nfor the use of posterity by one of his most distinguished\r\nsuccessors--to cultivate free commerce and honest friendship with all\r\nnations, but to make entangling alliances with none. A strict adherence\r\nto this policy has kept us aloof from the perplexing questions that now\r\nagitate the European world and have more than once deluged those\r\ncountries with blood. Should those scenes unfortunately recur, the\r\nparties to the contest may count on a faithful performance of the\r\nduties incumbent on us as a neutral nation, and our own citizens may\r\nequally rely on the firm assertion of their neutral rights.\r\n\r\nWith the nation that was our earliest friend and ally in the infancy of\r\nour political existence the most friendly relations have subsisted\r\nthrough the late revolutions of its Government, and, from the events of\r\nthe last, promise a permanent duration. It has made an approximation in\r\nsome of its political institutions to our own, and raised a monarch to\r\nthe throne who preserves, it is said, a friendly recollection of the\r\nperiod during which he acquired among our citizens the high\r\nconsideration that could then have been produced by his personal\r\nqualifications alone.\r\n\r\nOur commerce with that nation is gradually assuming a mutually\r\nbeneficial character, and the adjustment of the claims of our citizens\r\nhas removed the only obstacle there was to an intercourse not only\r\nlucrative, but productive of literary and scientific improvement.\r\n\r\nFrom Great Britain I have the satisfaction to inform you that I\r\ncontinue to receive assurances of the most amicable disposition, which\r\nhave on my part on all proper occasions been promptly and sincerely\r\nreciprocated. The attention of that Government has latterly been so\r\nmuch engrossed by matters of a deeply interesting domestic character\r\nthat we could not press upon it the renewal of negotiations which had\r\nbeen unfortunately broken off by the unexpected recall of our minister,\r\nwho had commenced them with some hopes of success. My great object was\r\nthe settlement of questions which, though now dormant, might here-after\r\nbe revived under circumstances that would endanger the good\r\nunderstanding which it is the interest of both parties to preserve\r\ninviolate, cemented as it is by a community of language, manners, and\r\nsocial habits, and by the high obligations we owe to our British\r\nancestors for many of our most valuable institutions and for that\r\nsystem of representative government which has enabled us to preserve\r\nand improve them.  The question of our North-East boundary still\r\nremains unsettled. In my last annual message I explained to you the\r\nsituation in which I found that business on my coming into office, and\r\nthe measures I thought it my duty to pursue for asserting the rights of\r\nthe United States before the sovereign who had been chosen by my\r\npredecessor to determine the question, and also the manner in which he\r\nhad disposed of it. A special message to the Senate in their executive\r\ncapacity afterwards brought before them to the question whether they\r\nwould advise a submission to the opinion of the sovereign arbiter. That\r\nbody having considered the award as not obligatory and advised me to\r\nopen a further negotiation, the proposition was immediately made to the\r\nBritish Government, but the circumstances to which I have alluded have\r\nhitherto prevented any answer being given to the overture. Early\r\nattention, however, has been promised to the subject, and every effort\r\non my part will be made for a satisfactory settlement of this question,\r\ninteresting to the Union generally, and particularly so to one of its\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nThe claims of our citizens on Spain are not yet acknowledged. On a\r\ncloser investigation of them than appears to have heretofore taken\r\nplace it was discovered that some of these demands, however strong they\r\nmight be upon the equity of that Government, were not such as could be\r\nmade the subject of national interference; and faithful to the\r\nprinciple of asking nothing but what was clearly right, additional\r\ninstructions have been sent to modify our demands so as to embrace\r\nthose only on which, according to the laws of nations, we had a strict\r\nright to insist. An inevitable delay in procuring the documents\r\nnecessary for this review of the merits of these claims retarded this\r\noperation until an unfortunate malady which has afflicted His Catholic\r\nMajesty prevented an examination of them. Being now for the first time\r\npresented in an unexceptionable form, it is confidently hoped that the\r\napplication will be successful.\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction to inform you that the application I directed\r\nto be made for the delivery of a part of the archives of Florida, which\r\nhad been carried to The Havannah, has produced a royal order for their\r\ndelivery, and that measures have been taken to procure its execution.\r\n\r\nBy the report of the Secretary of State communicated to you on June\r\n25th, 1832 you were informed of the conditional reduction obtained by\r\nthe minister of the United States at Madrid of the duties on tonnage\r\nlevied on American shipping in the ports of Spain. The condition of\r\nthat reduction having been complied with on our part by the act passed\r\nJuly 13th, 1832, I have the satisfaction to inform you that our ships\r\nnow pay no higher nor other duties in the continental ports of Spain\r\nthan are levied on their national vessels.\r\n\r\nThe demands against Portugal for illegal captures in the blockade of\r\nTerceira have been allowed to the full amount of the accounts presented\r\nby the claimants, and payment was promised to be made in three\r\ninstallments. The first of these has been paid; the second, although\r\ndue, had not at the date of our last advices been received, owing, it\r\nwas alleged, to embarrassments in the finances consequent on the civil\r\nwar in which that nation is engaged.\r\n\r\nThe payments stipulated by the convention with Denmark have been\r\npunctually made, and the amount is ready for distribution among the\r\nclaimants as soon as the board, now sitting, shall have performed their\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nI regret that by the last advices from our charge d'affaires at Naples\r\nthat Government had still delayed the satisfaction due to our citizens,\r\nbut at that date the effect of the last instructions was not known.\r\nDispatches from thence are hourly expected, and the result will be\r\ncommunicated to you without delay.\r\n\r\nWith the rest of Europe our relations, political and commercial, remain\r\nunchanged. Negotiations are going on to put on a permanent basis the\r\nliberal system of commerce now carried on between us and the Empire of\r\nRussia. The treaty concluded with Austria is executed by His Imperial\r\nMajesty with the most perfect good faith, and as we have no diplomatic\r\nagent at his Court he personally inquired into and corrected a\r\nproceeding of some of his subaltern officers to the injury of our\r\nconsul in one of his ports.\r\n\r\nOur treaty with the Sublime Porte is producing its expected effects on\r\nour commerce. New markets are opening for our commodities and a more\r\nextensive range for the employment of our ships. A slight augmentation\r\nof the duties on our commerce, inconsistent with the spirit of the\r\ntreaty, had been imposed, but on the representation of our charge\r\nd'affaires it has been promptly withdrawn, and we now enjoy the trade\r\nand navigation of the Black Sea and of all the ports belonging to the\r\nTurkish Empire and Asia on the most perfect equality with all foreign\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nI wish earnestly that in announcing to you the continuance of\r\nfriendship and the increase of a profitable commercial intercourse with\r\nMexico, with Central America, and the States of the South I could\r\naccompany it with the assurance that they all are blessed with that\r\ninternal tranquillity and foreign peace which their heroic devotion to\r\nthe cause of their independence merits. In Mexico a sanguinary struggle\r\nis now carried on, which has caused some embarrassment to our commerce,\r\nbut both parties profess the most friendly disposition toward us. To\r\nthe termination of this contest we look for the establishment of that\r\nsecure intercourse so necessary to nations whose territories are\r\ncontiguous. How important it will be to us we may calculate from the\r\nfact that even in this unfavorable state of things our maritime\r\ncommerce has increased, and an internal trade by caravans from St.\r\nLouis to Santa Fe, under the protection of escorts furnished by the\r\nGovernment, is carried on to great advantage and is daily increasing.\r\nThe agents provided for by the treaty, with this power to designate the\r\nboundaries which it established, have been named on our part, but one\r\nof the evils of the civil war now raging there has been that the\r\nappointment of those with whom they were to cooperate has not yet been\r\nannounced to us.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Central America has expelled from its territory the\r\nparty which some time since disturbed its peace. Desirous of fostering\r\na favorable disposition toward us, which has on more than one occasion\r\nbeen evinced by this interesting country, I made a second attempt in\r\nthis year to establish a diplomatic intercourse with them; but the\r\ndeath of the distinguished citizen whom I had appointed for that\r\npurpose has retarded the execution of measures from which I hoped much\r\nadvantage to our commerce. The union of the three States which formed\r\nthe Republic of Colombia has been dissolved, but they all, it is\r\nbelieved, consider themselves as separately bound by the treaty which\r\nwas made in their federal capacity. The minister accredited to the\r\nfederation continues in that character near the Government of New\r\nGrenada, and hopes were entertained that a new union would be formed\r\nbetween the separate States, at least for the purposes of foreign\r\nintercourse. Our minister has been instructed to use his good offices,\r\nwhen ever they shall be desired, to produce the reunion so much to be\r\nwished for, the domestic tranquillity of the parties, and the security\r\nand facility of foreign commerce.\r\n\r\nSome agitations naturally attendant on an infant reign have prevailed\r\nin the Empire of Brazil, which have had the usual effect upon\r\ncommercial operations, and while they suspended the consideration of\r\nclaims created on similar occasions, they have given rise to new\r\ncomplaints on the part of our citizens. A proper consideration for\r\ncalamities and difficulties of this nature has made us less urgent and\r\nperemptory in our demands for justice than duty to our fellow citizens\r\nwould under other circumstances have required. But their claims are not\r\nneglected, and will on all proper occasions be urged, and it is hoped\r\nwith effect.\r\n\r\nI refrain from making any communication on the subject of our affairs\r\nwith Buenos Ayres, because the negotiation communicated to you in my\r\nlast annual message was at the date of our last advices still pending\r\nand in a state that would render a publication of the details\r\ninexpedient.\r\n\r\nA treaty of amity and commerce has been formed with the Republic of\r\nChili, which, if approved by the Senate, will be laid before you. That\r\nGovernment seems to be established, and at peace with its neighbors;\r\nand its ports being the resorts of our ships which are employed in the\r\nhighly important trade of the fisheries, this commercial convention can\r\nnot but be of great advantage to our fellow citizens engaged in that\r\nperilous but profitable business.\r\n\r\nOur commerce with the neighboring State of Peru, owing to the onerous\r\nduties levied on our principal articles of export, has been on the\r\ndecline, and all endeavors to procure an alteration have hitherto\r\nproved fruitless. With Bolivia we have yet no diplomatic intercourse,\r\nand the continual contests carried on between it and Peru have made me\r\ndefer until a more favorable period the appointment of any agent for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\nAn act of atrocious piracy having been committed on one of our trading\r\nships by the inhabitants of a settlement on the west coast of Sumatra,\r\na frigate was dispatched with orders to demand satisfaction for the\r\ninjury if those who committed it should be found to be members of a\r\nregular government, capable of maintaining the usual relations with\r\nforeign nations; but if, as it was supposed and as they proved to be,\r\nthey were a band of lawless pirates, to inflict such a chastisement as\r\nwould deter them and others from like aggressions. This last was done,\r\nand the effect has been an increased respect for our flag in those\r\ndistant seas and additional security for our commerce.\r\n\r\nIn the view I have given of our connection with foreign powers\r\nallusions have been made to their domestic disturbances or foreign\r\nwars, to their revolutions or dissensions. It may be proper to observe\r\nthat this is done solely in cases where those events affect our\r\npolitical relations with them, or to show their operation on our\r\ncommerce. Further than this it is neither our policy nor our right to\r\ninterfere. Our best wishes on all occasions, our good offices when\r\nrequired, will be afforded to promote the domestic tranquillity and\r\nforeign peace of all nations with whom we have any intercourse. Any\r\nintervention in their affairs further than this, even by the expression\r\nof an official opinion, is contrary to our principles of international\r\npolicy, and will always be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe report which the Secretary of the Treasury will in due time lay\r\nbefore you will exhibit the national finances in a highly prosperous\r\nstate. Owing to the continued success of our commercial enterprise,\r\nwhich has enabled the merchants to fulfill their engagements with the\r\nGovernment, the receipts from customs during the year will exceed the\r\nestimate presented at the last session, and with the other means of the\r\nTreasury will prove fully adequate not only to meet the increased\r\nexpenditures resulting from the large appropriations made by Congress,\r\nbut to provide for the payment of all the public debt which is at\r\npresent redeemable.\r\n\r\nIt is now estimated that the customs will yield to the Treasury during\r\nthe present year upward of $28,000,000. The public lands, however, have\r\nproved less productive than was anticipated, and according to present\r\ninformation will not much exceed $2,000,000. The expenditures for all\r\nobjects other than the public debt are estimated to amount during the\r\nyear to about $16,500,000, while a still larger sum, viz, $18,000,000,\r\nwill have been applied to the principal and interest of the public\r\ndebt.  It is expected, however, that in consequence of the reduced\r\nrates of duty which will take effect after March 3d, 1833 there will be\r\na considerable falling off in the revenue from customs in the year\r\n1833. It will never the less be amply sufficient to provide for all the\r\nwants of the public service, estimated even upon a liberal scale, and\r\nfor the redemption and purchase of the remainder of the public debt. On\r\nJanuary 1st, 1833 the entire public debt of the United States, funded\r\nand unfunded, will be reduced to within a fraction of $7,000,000, of\r\nwhich $2,227,363 are not of right redeemable until January 1st, 1834\r\nand $4,735,296 not until January 2d, 1835. The commissioners of the\r\nsinking funds, however, being invested with full authority to purchase\r\nthe debt at the market price, and the means of the Treasury being\r\nample, it may be hoped that the whole will be extinguished within the\r\nyear 1833.\r\n\r\nI can not too cordially congratulate Congress and my fellow citizens on\r\nthe near approach of that memorable and happy event--the extinction of\r\nthe public debt of this great and free nation.\r\n\r\nFaithful to the wise and patriotic policy marked out by the legislation\r\nof the country for this object, the present Administration has devoted\r\nto it all the means which a flourishing commerce has supplied and a\r\nprudent economy preserved for the public Treasury. Within the four\r\nyears for which the people have confided the Executive power to my\r\ncharge $58,000,000 will have been applied to the payment of the public\r\ndebt. That this has been accomplished without stinting the expenditures\r\nfor all other proper objects will be seen by referring to the liberal\r\nprovision made during the same period for the support and increase of\r\nour means of maritime and military defense, for internal improvements\r\nof a national character, for the removal and preservation of the\r\nIndians, and, lastly, for the gallant veterans of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe final removal of this great burthen from our resources affords the\r\nmeans of further provision for all the objects of general welfare and\r\npublic defense which the Constitution authorizes, and presents the\r\noccasion for such further reductions in the revenue as may not be\r\nrequired for them. From the report of the Secretary of the Treasury it\r\nwill be seen that after the present year such a reduction may be made\r\nto a considerable extent, and the subject is earnestly recommended to\r\nthe consideration of Congress in the hope that the combined wisdom of\r\nthe representatives of the people will devise such means of effecting\r\nthat salutary object as may remove those burthens which shall be found\r\nto fall unequally upon any and as may promote all the great interests\r\nof the community.\r\n\r\nLong and patient reflection has strengthened the opinions I have\r\nheretofore expressed to Congress on this subject, and I deem it my duty\r\non the present occasion again to urge them upon the attention of the\r\nLegislature. The soundest maxims of public policy and the principals\r\nupon which our republican institutions are founded recommend a proper\r\nadaptation of the revenue to the expenditure, and they also require\r\nthat the expenditure shall be limited to what, by an economical\r\nadministration, shall be consistent with the simplicity of the\r\nGovernment and necessary to an efficient public service.\r\n\r\nIn effecting this adjustment it is due, in justice to the interests of\r\nthe different States, and even to the preservation of the Union itself,\r\nthat the protection afforded by existing laws to any branches of the\r\nnational industry should not exceed what may be necessary to counteract\r\nthe regulations of foreign nations and to secure a supply of those\r\narticles of manufacture essential to the national independence and\r\nsafety in time of war. If upon investigation it shall be found, as it\r\nis believed it will be, that the legislative protection granted to any\r\nparticular interest is greater than is indispensably requisite for\r\nthese objects, I recommend that it be gradually diminished, and that as\r\nfar as may be consistent with these objects the whole scheme of duties\r\nbe reduced to the revenue standard as soon as a just regard to the\r\nfaith of the Government and to the preservation of the large capital\r\ninvested in establishments of domestic industry will permit.\r\n\r\nThat manufactures adequate to the supply of our domestic consumption\r\nwould in the abstract be beneficial to our country there is no reason\r\nto doubt, and to effect their establishment there is perhaps no\r\nAmerican citizen who would not for a while be willing to pay a higher\r\nprice for them. But for this purpose it is presumed that a tariff of\r\nhigh duties, designed for perpetual protection, which they maintain has\r\nthe effect to reduce the price by domestic competition below that of\r\nthe foreign article. Experience, however, our best guide on this as on\r\nother subjects, makes it doubtful whether the advantages of this system\r\nare not counter-balanced by many evils, and whether it does not tend to\r\nbeget in the minds of a large portion of our country-men a spirit of\r\ndiscontent and jealousy dangerous to the stability of the Union.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, shall be done? Large interests have grown up under the\r\nimplied pledge of our national legislation, which it would seem a\r\nviolation of public faith suddenly to abandon. Nothing could justify it\r\nbut the public safety, which is the supreme law. But those who have\r\nvested their capital in manufacturing establishments can not expect\r\nthat the people will continue permanently to pay high taxes for their\r\nbenefit, when the money is not required for any legitimate purpose in\r\nthe administration of the Government. Is it not enough that the high\r\nduties have been paid as long as the money arising from them could be\r\napplied to the common benefit in the extinguishment of the public debt?\r\n\r\nThose who take an enlarged view of the condition of our country must be\r\nsatisfied that the policy of protection must be ultimately limited to\r\nthose articles of domestic manufacture which are indispensable to our\r\nsafety in time of war. Within this scope, on a reasonable scale, it is\r\nrecommended by every consideration of patriotism and duty, which will\r\ndoubtless always secure to it a liberal and efficient support. But\r\nbeyond this object we have already seen the operation of the system\r\nproductive of discontent. In some sections of the Republic its\r\ninfluence is deprecated as tending to concentrate wealth into a few\r\nhands, and as creating those germs of dependence and vice which in\r\nother countries have characterized the existence of monopolies and\r\nproved so destructive of liberty and the general good. A large portion\r\nof the people in one section of the Republic declares it not only\r\ninexpedient on these grounds, but as disturbing the equal relations of\r\nproperty by legislation, and therefore unconstitutional and unjust.\r\n\r\nDoubtless these effects are in a great degree exaggerated, and may be\r\nascribed to a mistaken view of the considerations which led to the\r\nadoption of the tariff system; but they are never the less important in\r\nenabling us to review the subject with a more thorough knowledge of all\r\nits bearings upon the great interests of the Republic, and with a\r\ndetermination to dispose of it so that none can with justice complain.\r\n\r\nIt is my painful duty to state that in one quarter of the United States\r\nopposition to the revenue laws has arisen to a height which threatens\r\nto thwart their execution, if not to endanger the integrity of the\r\nUnion. What ever obstructions may be thrown in the way of the judicial\r\nauthorities of the General Government, it is hoped they will be able\r\npeaceably to overcome them by the prudence of their own officers and\r\nthe patriotism of the people. But should this reasonable reliance on\r\nthe moderation and good sense of all portions of our fellow citizens be\r\ndisappointed, it is believed that the laws themselves are fully\r\nadequate to the suppression of such attempts as may be immediately\r\nmade. Should the exigency arise rendering the execution of the existing\r\nlaws impracticable from any cause what ever, prompt notice of it will\r\nbe given to Congress, with a suggestion of such views and measures as\r\nmay be deemed necessary to meet it.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with principles heretofore explained, and with the hope\r\nof reducing the General Government to that simple machine which the\r\nConstitution created and of withdrawing from the States all other\r\ninfluence than that of its universal beneficence in preserving peace,\r\naffording an uniform currency, maintaining the inviolability of\r\ncontracts, diffusing intelligence, and discharging unfelt its other\r\nsuper-intending functions, I recommend that provision be made to\r\ndispose of all stocks now held by it in corporations, whether created\r\nby the General or State Governments, and placing the proceeds in the\r\nTreasury. As a source of profit these stocks are of little or no value;\r\nas a means of influence among the States they are adverse to the purity\r\nof our institutions. The whole principle on which they are based is\r\ndeemed by many unconstitutional, and to persist in the policy which\r\nthey indicate is considered wholly inexpedient.\r\n\r\nIt is my duty to acquaint you with an arrangement made by the Bank of\r\nthe United States with a portion of the holders of the 3% stock, by\r\nwhich the Government will be deprived of the use of the public funds\r\nlonger than was anticipated. By this arrangement, which will be\r\nparticularly explained by the Secretary of the Treasury, a surrender of\r\nthe certificates of this stock may be postponed until October, 1833,\r\nand thus may be continued by the failure of the bank to perform its\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nSuch measures as are within the reach of the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nhave been taken to enable him to judge whether the public deposits in\r\nthat institution may be regarded as entirely safe; but as his limited\r\npower may prove inadequate to this object, I recommend the subject to\r\nthe attention of Congress, under the firm belief that it is worthy of\r\ntheir serious investigation. An inquiry into the transactions of the\r\ninstitution, embracing the branches as well as the principal bank,\r\nseems called for by the credit which is given throughout the country to\r\nmany serious charges impeaching its character, and which if true may\r\njustly excite the apprehension that it is no longer a safe depository\r\nof the money of the people.\r\n\r\nAmong the interests which merit the consideration of Congress after the\r\npayment of the public debt, one of the most important, in my view, is\r\nthat of the public lands. Previous to the formation of our present\r\nConstitution it was recommended by Congress that a portion of the waste\r\nlands owned by the States should be ceded to the United States for the\r\npurposes of general harmony and as a fund to meet the expenses of the\r\nwar. The recommendation was adopted, and at different periods of time\r\nthe States of Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, North and South\r\nCarolina, and Georgia granted their vacant soil for the uses for which\r\nthey had been asked. As the lands may now be considered as relieved\r\nfrom this pledge, it is in the discretion of Congress to dispose of\r\nthem in such way as best to conduce to the quiet, harmony, and general\r\ninterest of the American people. In examining this question all local\r\nand sectional feelings should be discarded and the whole United States\r\nregarded as one people, interested alike in the prosperity of their\r\ncommon country.\r\n\r\nIt can not be doubted that the speedy settlement of these lands\r\nconstitutes the true interest of the Republic. The wealth and strength\r\nof a country are its population, and the best part of that population\r\nare cultivators of the soil. Independent farmers are every where the\r\nbasis of society and true friends of liberty.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these considerations questions have already arisen, and\r\nmay be expected hereafter to grow out of the public lands, which\r\ninvolve the rights of the new States and the powers of the General\r\nGovernment, and unless a liberal policy be now adopted there is danger\r\nthat these questions may speedily assume an importance not now\r\ngenerally anticipated. The influence of a great sectional interest,\r\nwhen brought into full action, will be found more dangerous to the\r\nharmony and union of the States than any other cause of discontent, and\r\nit is the part of wisdom and sound policy to foresee its approaches and\r\nendeavor if possible to counteract them.\r\n\r\nOf the various schemes which have been hitherto proposed in regard to\r\nthe disposal of the public lands, none has yet received the entire\r\napprobation of the National Legislature. Deeply impressed with the\r\nimportance of a speedy and satisfactory arrangement of the subject, I\r\ndeem it my duty on this occasion to urge it upon your consideration,\r\nand to the propositions which have been heretofore suggested by others\r\nto contribute those reflections which have occurred to me, in the hope\r\nthat they may assist you in your future deliberations.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me to be our policy that the public lands shall cease as\r\nsoon as practicable to be a source of revenue, and that they be sold to\r\nsettlers in limited parcels at a price barely sufficient to reimburse\r\nto the United States the expense of the present system and the cost\r\narising under our Indian compacts. The advantages of accurate surveys\r\nand undoubted titles now secured to purchasers seem to forbid the\r\nabolition of the present system, because none can be substituted which\r\nwill more perfectly accomplish these important ends. It is desirable,\r\nhowever, that in convenient time this machinery be withdrawn from the\r\nStates, and that the right of soil and the future disposition of it be\r\nsurrendered to the States respectively in which it lies.\r\n\r\nThe adventurous and hardy population of the West, besides contributing\r\ntheir equal share of taxation under our impost system, have in the\r\nprogress of our Government, for the lands they occupy, paid into the\r\nTreasury a large proportion of $40,000,000, and of the revenue received\r\ntherefrom but a small part has been expended among them. When to the\r\ndisadvantage of their situation in this respect we add the\r\nconsideration that it is their labor alone which gives real value to\r\nthe lands, and that the proceeds arising from their sale are\r\ndistributed chiefly among States which had not originally any claim to\r\nthem, and which have enjoyed the undivided emolument arising from the\r\nsale of their own lands, it can not be expected that the new States\r\nwill remain longer contented with the present policy after the payment\r\nof the public debt. To avert the consequences which may be apprehended\r\nfrom this cause, to pub an end for ever to all partial and interested\r\nlegislation on the subject, and to afford to every American citizen of\r\nenterprise the opportunity of securing an independent freehold, it\r\nseems to me, therefore, best to abandon the idea of raising a future\r\nrevenue out of the public lands.\r\n\r\nIn former messages I have expressed my conviction that the Constitution\r\ndoes not warrant the application of the funds of the General Government\r\nto objects of internal improvement which are not national in their\r\ncharacter, and, both as a means of doing justice to all interests and\r\nputting an end to a course of legislation calculated to destroy the\r\npurity of the Government, have urged the necessity of reducing the\r\nwhole subject to some fixed and certain rule. As there never will occur\r\na period, perhaps, more propitious than the present to the\r\naccomplishment of this object, I beg leave to press the subject again\r\nupon your attention.\r\n\r\nWithout some general and well-defined principles ascertaining those\r\nobjects of internal improvement to which the means of the nation may be\r\nconstitutionally applied, it is obvious that the exercise of the power\r\ncan never be satisfactory. Besides the danger to which it exposes\r\nCongress of making hasty appropriations to works of the character of\r\nwhich they may be frequently ignorant, it promotes a mischievous and\r\ncorrupting influence upon elections by holding out to the people the\r\nfallacious hope that the success of a certain candidate will make\r\nnavigable their neighboring creek or river, bring commerce to their\r\ndoors, and increase the value of their property. It thus favors\r\ncombinations to squander the treasure of the country upon a multitude\r\nof local objects, as fatal to just legislation as to the purity of\r\npublic men.\r\n\r\nIf a system compatible with the Constitution can not be devised which\r\nis free from such tendencies, we should recollect that that instrument\r\nprovides within itself the mode of its amendment, and that there is,\r\ntherefore, no excuse for the assumption of doubtful powers by the\r\nGeneral Government. If those which are clearly granted shall be found\r\nincompetent to the ends of its creation, it can at any time apply for\r\ntheir enlargement; and there is no probability that such an\r\napplication, if founded on the public interest, will ever be refused.\r\nIf the propriety of the proposed grant be not sufficiently apparent to\r\ncommand the assent of 3/4 of the States, the best possible reason why\r\nthe power should not be assumed on doubtful authority is afforded; for\r\nif more than one quarter of the States are unwilling to make the grant\r\nits exercise will be productive of discontents which will far\r\nover-balance any advantages that could be derived from it. All must\r\nadmit that there is nothing so worthy of the constant solicitude of\r\nthis Government as the harmony and union of the people.\r\n\r\nBeing solemnly impressed with the conviction that the extension of the\r\npower to make internal improvements beyond the limit I have suggested,\r\neven if it be deemed constitutional, is subversive of the best\r\ninterests of our country, I earnestly recommend to Congress to refrain\r\nfrom its exercise in doubtful cases, except in relation to improvements\r\nalready begun, unless they shall first procure from the States such an\r\namendment of the Constitution as will define its character and\r\nprescribe its bounds. If the States feel themselves competent to these\r\nobjects, why should this Government wish to assume the power? If they\r\ndo not, then they will not hesitate to make the grant. Both Governments\r\nare the Governments of the people; improvements must be made with the\r\nmoney of the people, and if the money can be collected and applied by\r\nthose more simple and economical political machines, the State\r\ngovernments, it will unquestionably be safer and better for the people\r\nthan to add to the splendor, the patronage, and the power of the\r\nGeneral Government. But if the people of the several States think\r\notherwise they will amend the Constitution, and in their decision all\r\nought cheerfully to acquiesce.\r\n\r\nFor a detailed and highly satisfactory view of the operations of the\r\nWar Department I refer you to the accompanying report of the Secretary\r\nof War.\r\n\r\nThe hostile incursions of the Sac and Fox Indians necessarily led to\r\nthe interposition of the Government. A portion of the troops, under\r\nGenerals Scott and Atkinson, and of the militia of the State of\r\nIllinois were called into the field. After a harassing warfare,\r\nprolonged by the nature of the country and by the difficulty of\r\nprocuring subsistence, the Indians were entirely defeated, and the\r\ndisaffected band dispersed or destroyed. The result has been creditable\r\nto the troops engaged in the service. Severe as is the lesson to the\r\nIndians, it was rendered necessary by their unprovoked aggressions, and\r\nit is to be hoped that its impression will be permanent and salutary.\r\n\r\nThis campaign has evinced the efficient organization of the Army and\r\nits capacity for prompt and active service. Its several departments\r\nhave performed their functions with energy and dispatch, and the\r\ngeneral movement was satisfactory.\r\n\r\nOur fellow citizens upon the frontiers were ready, as they always are,\r\nin the tender of their services in the hour of danger. But a more\r\nefficient organization of our militia system is essential to that\r\nsecurity which is one of the principal objects of all governments.\r\nNeither our situation nor our institutions require or permit the\r\nmaintenance of a large regular force. History offers too many lessons\r\nof the fatal result of such a measure not to warn us against its\r\nadoption here. The expense which attends it, the obvious tendency to\r\nemploy it because it exists and thus to engage in unnecessary wars, and\r\nits ultimate danger to public liberty will lead us, I trust, to place\r\nour principal dependence for protection upon the great body of the\r\ncitizens of the Republic. If in asserting rights or in repelling wrongs\r\nwar should come upon us, our regular force should be increased to an\r\nextent proportional to the emergency, and our present small Army is a\r\nnucleus around which such force could be formed and embodied. But for\r\nthe purposes of defense under ordinary circumstances we must rely upon\r\nthe electors of the country. Those by whom and for whom the Government\r\nwas instituted and is supported will constitute its protection in the\r\nhour of danger as they do its check in the hour of safety.\r\n\r\nBut it is obvious that the militia system is imperfect. Much time is\r\nlost, much unnecessary expense incurred, and much public property\r\nwasted under the present arrangement. Little useful knowledge is gained\r\nby the musters and drills as now established, and the whole subject\r\nevidently requires a thorough examination. Whether a plan of\r\nclassification remedying these defects and providing for a system of\r\ninstruction might not be adopted is submitted to the consideration of\r\nCongress. The Constitution has vested in the General Government an\r\nindependent authority upon the subject of the militia which renders its\r\naction essential to the establishment or improvement of the system, and\r\nI recommend the matter to your consideration in the conviction that the\r\nstate of this important arm of the public defense requires your\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nI am happy to inform you that the wise and humane policy of\r\ntransferring from the eastern to the western side of the Mississippi\r\nthe remnants of our aboriginal tribes, with their own consent and upon\r\njust terms, has been steadily pursued, and is approaching, I trust, its\r\nconsummation. By reference to the report of the Secretary of War and to\r\nthe documents submitted with it you will see the progress which has\r\nbeen made since your last session in the arrangement of the various\r\nmatters connected with our Indian relations. With one exception every\r\nsubject involving any question of conflicting jurisdiction or of\r\npeculiar difficulty has been happily disposed of, and the conviction\r\nevidently gains ground among the Indians that their removal to the\r\ncountry assigned by the United States for their permanent residence\r\nfurnishes the only hope of their ultimate prosperity.\r\n\r\nWith that portion of the Cherokees, however, living within the State of\r\nGeorgia it has been found impracticable as yet to make a satisfactory\r\nadjustment. Such was my anxiety to remove all the grounds of complaint\r\nand to bring to a termination the difficulties in which they are\r\ninvolved that I directed the very liberal propositions to be made to\r\nthem which accompany the documents herewith submitted. They can not but\r\nhave seen in these offers the evidence of the strongest disposition on\r\nthe part of the Government to deal justly and liberally with them. An\r\nample indemnity was offered for their present possessions, a liberal\r\nprovision for their future support and improvement, and full security\r\nfor their private and political rights. What ever difference of opinion\r\nmay have prevailed respecting the just claims of these people, there\r\nwill probably be none respecting the liberality of the propositions,\r\nand very little respecting the expediency of their immediate\r\nacceptance. They were, however, rejected, and thus the position of\r\nthese Indians remains unchanged, as do the views communicated in my\r\nmessage to the Senate of February 22d, 1831.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the annual report of the Secretary of the Navy, which\r\naccompanies this message, for a detail of the operations of that branch\r\nof the service during the present year.\r\n\r\nBesides the general remarks on some of the transactions of our Navy\r\npresented in the view which has been taken of our foreign relations, I\r\nseize this occasion to invite to your notice the increased protection\r\nwhich it has afforded to our commerce and citizens on distant seas\r\nwithout any augmentation of the force in commission. In the gradual\r\nimprovement of its pecuniary concerns, in the constant progress in the\r\ncollection of materials suitable for use during future emergencies, and\r\nin the construction of vessels and the buildings necessary to their\r\npreservation and repair, the present state of this branch of the\r\nservice exhibits the fruits of that vigilance and care which are so\r\nindispensable to its efficiency. Various new suggestions, contained in\r\nthe annexed report, as well as others heretofore to Congress, are\r\nworthy of your attention, but none more so than that urging the renewal\r\nfor another term of six years of the general appropriation for the\r\ngradual improvement of the Navy.\r\n\r\nFrom the accompanying report of the Post Master General you will also\r\nperceive that that Department continues to extend its usefulness\r\nwithout impairing its resources or lessening the accommodations which\r\nit affords in the secure and rapid transportation of the mail.\r\n\r\nI beg leave to call the attention of Congress to the views heretofore\r\nexpressed in relation to the mode of choosing the President and Vice-\r\nPresident of the United States, and to those respecting the tenure of\r\noffice generally. Still impressed with the justness of those views and\r\nwith the belief that the modifications suggested on those subjects if\r\nadopted will contribute to the prosperity and harmony of the country, I\r\nearnestly recommend them to your consideration at this time.\r\n\r\nI have heretofore pointed out defects in the law for punishing official\r\nfrauds, especially within the District of Columbia. It has been found\r\nalmost impossible to bring notorious culprits to punishment, and,\r\naccording to a decision of the court for this District, a prosecution\r\nis barred by a lapse of two years after the fraud has been committed.\r\nIt may happen again, as it has already happened, that during the whole\r\ntwo years all the evidences of the fraud may be in the possession of\r\nthe culprit himself. However proper the limitation may be in relation\r\nto private citizens, it would seem that it ought not to commence\r\nrunning in favor of public officers until they go out of office.\r\n\r\nThe judiciary system of the United States remains imperfect. Of the 9\r\nWestern and South Western States, three only enjoy the benefits of a\r\ncircuit court. Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee are embraced in the\r\ngeneral system, but Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Alabama, Mississippi,\r\nand Louisiana have only district courts. If the existing system be a\r\ngood one, why should it not be extended? If it be a bad one, why is it\r\nsuffered to exist? The new States were promised equal rights and\r\nprivileges when they came into the Union, and such are the guaranties\r\nof the Constitution. Nothing can be more obvious than the obligation of\r\nthe General Government to place all the States on the same footing in\r\nrelation to the administration of justice, and I trust this duty will\r\nbe neglected no longer.\r\n\r\nOn many of the subjects to which your attention is invited in this\r\ncommunication it is a source of gratification to reflect that the steps\r\nto be now adopted are uninfluenced by the embarrassments entailed upon\r\nthe country by the wars through which it has passed. In regard to most\r\nof our great interests we may consider ourselves as just starting in\r\nour career, and after a salutary experience about to fix upon a\r\npermanent basis the policy best calculated to promote the happiness of\r\nthe people and facilitate their progress toward the most complete\r\nenjoyment of civil liberty. On an occasion so interesting and important\r\nin our history, and of such anxious concern to the friends of freedom\r\nthroughout the world, it is our imperious duty to lay aside all selfish\r\nand local considerations and be guided by a lofty spirit of devotion to\r\nthe great principles on which our institutions are founded.\r\n\r\nThat this Government may be so administered as to preserve its\r\nefficiency in promoting and securing these general objects should be\r\nthe only aim of our ambition, and we can not, therefore, too carefully\r\nexamine its structure, in order that we may not mistake its powers or\r\nassume those which the people have reserved to themselves or have\r\npreferred to assign to other agents. We should bear constantly in mind\r\nthe fact that the considerations which induced the framers of the\r\nConstitution to withhold from the General Government the power to\r\nregulate the great mass of the business and concerns of the people have\r\nbeen fully justified by experience, and that it can not now be doubted\r\nthat the genius of all our institutions prescribes simplicity and\r\neconomy as the characteristics of the reform which is yet to be\r\neffected in the present and future execution of the functions bestowed\r\nupon us by the Constitution.\r\n\r\nLimited to a general superintending power to maintain peace at home and\r\nabroad, and to prescribe laws on a few subjects of general interest not\r\ncalculated to restrict human liberty, but to enforce human rights, this\r\nGovernment will find its strength and its glory in the faithful\r\ndischarge of these plain and simple duties. Relieved by its protecting\r\nshield from the fear of war and the apprehension of oppression, the\r\nfree enterprise of our citizens, aided by the State sovereignties, will\r\nwork out improvements and ameliorations which can not fail to\r\ndemonstrate that the great truth that the people can govern themselves\r\nis not only realized in our example, but that it is done by a machinery\r\nin government so simple and economical as scarcely to be felt. That the\r\nAlmighty Ruler of the Universe may so direct our deliberations and\r\nover-rule our acts as to make us instrumental in securing a result so\r\ndear to mankind is my most earnest and sincere prayer.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nAndrew Jackson\r\nDecember 3, 1833\r\n\r\nFellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nOn your assembling to perform the high trusts which the people of the\r\nUnited States have confided to you, of legislating for their common\r\nwelfare, it gives me pleasure to congratulate you upon the happy\r\ncondition of our beloved country. By the favor of Divine Providence\r\nhealth is again restored to us, peace reigns within our borders,\r\nabundance crowns the labors of our fields, commerce and domestic\r\nindustry flourish and increase, and individual happiness rewards the\r\nprivate virtue and enterprise of our citizens.\r\n\r\nOur condition abroad is no less honorable than it is prosperous at\r\nhome. Seeking nothing that is not right and determined to submit to\r\nnothing that is wrong, but desiring honest friendships and liberal\r\nintercourse with all nations, the United States have gained throughout\r\nthe world the confidence and respect which are due to a policy so just\r\nand so congenial to the character of the American people and to the\r\nspirit of their institutions.\r\n\r\nIn bringing to your notice the particular state of our foreign affairs,\r\nit affords me high gratification to inform you that they are in a\r\ncondition which promises the continuance of friendship with all\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nWith Great Britain the interesting question of our North East boundary\r\nremains still undecided. A negotiation, however, upon that subject has\r\nbeen renewed since the close of the last Congress, and a proposition\r\nhas been submitted to the British Government with the view of\r\nestablishing, in conformity with the resolution of the Senate, the line\r\ndesignated by the treaty of 1783. Though no definitive answer has been\r\nreceived, it may be daily looked for, and I entertain a hope that the\r\noverture may ultimately lead to a satisfactory adjustment of this\r\nimportant matter.\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction to inform you that a negotiation which, by\r\ndesire of the House of Representatives, was opened some years ago with\r\nthe British Government, for the erection of light houses on the\r\nBahamas, has been successful. Those works, when completed, together\r\nwith those which the United States have constructed on the western side\r\nof the Gulf of Florida, will contribute essentially to the safety of\r\nnavigation in that sea. This joint participation in establishments\r\ninteresting to humanity and beneficial to commerce is worthy of two\r\nenlightened nations, and indicates feelings which can not fail to have\r\na happy influence upon their political relations. It is gratifying to\r\nthe friends of both to perceive that the intercourse between the two\r\npeople is becoming daily more extensive, and that sentiments of mutual\r\ngood will have grown up befitting their common origin and justifying\r\nthe hope that by wise counsels on each side not only unsettled\r\nquestions may be satisfactorily terminated, but new causes of\r\nmisunderstanding prevented.\r\n\r\nNot withstanding that I continue to receive the most amicable\r\nassurances from the Government of France, and that in all other\r\nrespects the most friendly relations exist between the United States\r\nand that Government, it is to be regretted that the stipulations of the\r\nconvention concluded on July 4th, 1831 remain in some important parts\r\nunfulfilled.\r\n\r\nBy the second article of that convention it was stipulated that the sum\r\npayable to the United States should be paid at Paris, in six annual\r\ninstallments, into the hands of such person or persons as should be\r\nauthorized by the Government of the United States to receive it, and by\r\nthe same article the first installment was payable on February 2d,\r\n1833. By the act of Congress of July 13th, 1832 it was made the duty of\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury to cause the several installments, with\r\nthe interest thereon, to be received from the French Government and\r\ntransferred to the United States in such manner as he may deem best;\r\nand by the same act of Congress the stipulations on the part of the\r\nUnited States in the convention were in all respects fulfilled. Not\r\ndoubting that a treaty thus made and ratified by the two Governments,\r\nand faithfully executed by the United States, would be promptly\r\ncomplied with by the other party, and desiring to avoid the risk and\r\nexpense of intermediate agencies, the Secretary of the Treasury deemed\r\nit advisable to receive and transfer the first installment by means of\r\na draft upon the French minister of finance.\r\n\r\nA draft for this purpose was accordingly drawn in favor of the cashier\r\nof the Bank of the United States for the amount accruing to the United\r\nStates out of the first installment, and the interest payable with it.\r\nThis bill was not drawn at Washington until five days after the\r\ninstallment was payable at Paris, and was accompanied by a special\r\nauthority from the President authorizing the cashier or his assigns to\r\nreceive the amount. The mode thus adopted of receiving the installment\r\nwas officially made known to the French Government by the American\r\ncharge d'affaires at Paris, pursuant to instructions from the\r\nDepartment of State. The bill, however, though not presented for\r\npayment until March 23d, 1833, was not paid, and for the reason\r\nassigned by the French minister of finance that no appropriation had\r\nbeen made by the French Chambers. It is not known to me that up to that\r\nperiod any appropriation had been required of the Chambers, and\r\nalthough a communication was subsequently made to the Chambers by\r\ndirection of the King, recommending that the necessary provision should\r\nbe made for carrying the convention into effect, it was at an advanced\r\nperiod of the session, and the subject was finally postponed until the\r\nnext meeting of the Chambers.\r\n\r\nNot withstanding it has been supposed by the French ministry that the\r\nfinancial stipulations of the treaty can not be carried into effect\r\nwithout an appropriation by the Chambers, it appears to me to be not\r\nonly consistent with the character of France, but due to the character\r\nof both Governments, as well as to the rights of our citizens, to treat\r\nthe convention, made and ratified in proper form, as pledging the good\r\nfaith of the French Government for its execution, and as imposing upon\r\neach department an obligation to fulfill it; and I have received\r\nassurances through our charge d'affaires at Paris and the French\r\nminister plenipotentiary at Washington, and more recently through the\r\nminister of the United States at Paris, that the delay has not\r\nproceeded from any indisposition on the part of the King and his\r\nministers to fulfill their treaty, and that measures will be presented\r\nat the next meeting of the Chambers, and with a reasonable hope of\r\nsuccess, to obtain the necessary appropriation.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to state, however, that the documents, except certain\r\nlists of vessels captured, condemned, or burnt at sea, proper to\r\nfacilitate the examination and liquidation of the reclamations\r\ncomprised in the stipulations of the convention, and which by the 6th\r\narticle France engaged to communicate to the United States by the\r\nintermediary of the legation, though repeatedly applied for by the\r\nAmerican charge d'affaires under instructions from this Government,\r\nhave not yet been communicated; and this delay, it is apprehended, will\r\nnecessarily prevent the completion of the duties assigned to the\r\ncommissioners within the time at present prescribed by law.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for delaying to communicate these documents have not been\r\nexplicitly stated, and this is the more to be regretted as it is not\r\nunderstood that the interposition of the Chambers is in any manner\r\nrequired for the delivery of those papers.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, in a case so important to the interests of\r\nour citizens and to the character of our country, and under\r\ndisappointments so unexpected, I deemed it my duty, however I might\r\nrespect the general assurances to which I have adverted, no longer to\r\ndelay the appointment of a minister plenipotentiary to Paris, but to\r\ndispatch him in season to communicate the result of his application to\r\nthe French Government at an early period of your session. I accordingly\r\nappointed a distinguished citizen for this purpose, who proceeded on\r\nhis mission in August last and was presented to the King early in the\r\nmonth of October. He is particularly instructed as to all matters\r\nconnected with the present posture of affairs, and I indulge the hope\r\nthat with the representations he is instructed to make, and from the\r\ndisposition manifested by the King and his ministers in their recent\r\nassurances to our minister at Paris, the subject will be early\r\nconsidered, and satisfactorily disposed of at the next meeting of the\r\nChambers.\r\n\r\nAs this subject involves important interests and has attracted a\r\nconsiderable share of the public attention, I have deemed it proper to\r\nmake this explicit statement of its actual condition, and should I be\r\ndisappointed in the hope now entertained the subject will be again\r\nbrought to the notice of Congress in such manner as the occasion may\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nThe friendly relations which have always been maintained between the\r\nUnited States and Russia have been further extended and strengthened by\r\nthe treaty of navigation and commerce concluded on December 6th, 1832,\r\nand sanctioned by the Senate before the close of its last session. The\r\nratifications having been since exchanged, the liberal provisions of\r\nthe treaty are now in full force, and under the encouragement which\r\nthey have secured a flourishing and increasing commerce, yielding its\r\nbenefits to the enterprise of both nations, affords to each the just\r\nrecompense of wise measures, and adds new motives for that mutual\r\nfriendship which the two countries have hitherto cherished toward each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIt affords me peculiar satisfaction to state that the Government of\r\nSpain has at length yielded to the justice of the claims which have\r\nbeen so long urged in behalf of our citizens, and has expressed a\r\nwillingness to provide an indemnification as soon as the proper amount\r\ncan be agreed upon. Upon this latter point it is probable an\r\nunderstanding had taken place between the minister of the United States\r\nand the Spanish Government before the decease of the late King of\r\nSpain; and, unless that event may have delayed its completion, there is\r\nreason to hope that it may be in my power to announce to you early in\r\nyour present session the conclusion of a convention upon terms not less\r\nfavorable than those entered into for similar objects with other\r\nnations. That act of justice would well accord with the character of\r\nSpain, and is due to the United States from their ancient friend. It\r\ncould not fail to strengthen the sentiments of amity and good will\r\nbetween the two nations which it is so much the wish of the United\r\nStates to cherish and so truly the interest of both to maintain.\r\n\r\nBy the first section of an act of Congress passed on July 13th, 1832\r\nthe tonnage duty on Spanish ships arriving from the ports of Spain\r\nprevious to October 20th, 1817, being five cents per ton. That act was\r\nintended to give effect on our side to an arrangement made with the\r\nSpanish Government by which discriminating duties of tonnage were to be\r\nabolished in the ports of the United States and Spain on he vessels of\r\nthe two nations. Pursuant to that arrangement, which was carried into\r\neffect on the part of Spain on May 20th, 1832, by a royal order dated\r\nApril 29th, 1832, American vessels in the ports of Spain have paid five\r\ncents per ton, which rate of duty is also paid in those ports by\r\nSpanish ships; but as American vessels pay no tonnage duty in the ports\r\nof the United States, the duty of five cents payable in our ports by\r\nSpanish vessels under the act above mentioned is really a\r\ndiscriminating duty, operating to the disadvantage of Spain.\r\n\r\nThough no complaint has yet been made on the part of Spain, we are not\r\nthe less bound by the obligations of good faith to remove the\r\ndiscrimination, and I recommend that the act be amended accordingly. As\r\nthe royal order above alluded to includes the ports of the Balearic and\r\nCanary islands as well as those of Spain, it would seem that the\r\nprovisions of the act of Congress should be equally extensive, and that\r\nfor the repayments of such duties as may have been improperly received\r\nan addition should be made to the sum appropriated at the last session\r\nof Congress for refunding discriminating duties.\r\n\r\nAs the arrangement referred to, however, did not embrace the islands of\r\nCuba and Puerto Rico, discriminating duties to the prejudice of\r\nAmerican shipping continue to be levied there. From the extent of the\r\ncommerce carried on between the United States and those islands,\r\nparticularly the former, this discrimination causes serious injury to\r\none of those great national interests which it has been considered an\r\nessential part of our policy to cherish, and has given rise to\r\ncomplaints on the part of our merchants. Under instructions given to\r\nour minister at Madrid, earnest representations have been made by him\r\nto the Spanish Government upon this subject, and there is reason to\r\nexpect, from the friendly disposition which is entertained toward this\r\ncountry, that a beneficial change will be produced.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage, however, to which our shipping is subjected by the\r\noperation of these discriminating duties requires that they be met by\r\nsuitable countervailing duties during your present session, power being\r\nat the same time vested in the President to modify or discontinue them\r\nas the discriminating duties on American vessels or their cargoes may\r\nbe modified or discontinued at those islands. Intimations have been\r\ngiven to the Spanish Government that the United States may be obliged\r\nto resort to such measures as are of necessary self-defense, and there\r\nis no reason to apprehend that it would be unfavorably received. The\r\nproposed proceeding if adopted would not be permitted, however, in any\r\ndegree to induce a relaxation in the efforts of our minister to effect\r\na repeal of this irregularity by friendly negotiation, and it might\r\nserve to give force to his representations by showing the dangers to\r\nwhich that valuable trade is exposed by the obstructions and burdens\r\nwhich a system of discriminating and countervailing duties necessarily\r\nproduces.\r\n\r\nThe selection and preparation of the Florida archives for the purpose\r\nof being delivered over to the United States, in conformity with the\r\nroyal order as mentioned in my last annual message, though in progress,\r\nhas not yet been completed. This delay has been produced partly by\r\ncauses which were unavoidable, particularly the prevalence of the\r\ncholera at Havana; but measures have been taken which it is believed\r\nwill expedite the delivery of those important records.\r\n\r\nCongress were informed at the opening of the last session that \"owing,\r\nas was alleged, to embarrassments in the finances of Portugal,\r\nconsequent upon the civil war in which that nation was engaged\",\r\npayment had been made of only one installment of the amount which the\r\nPortuguese Government had stipulated to pay for indemnifying our\r\ncitizens for property illegally captured in the blockade of Terceira.\r\nSince that time a postponement for two years, with interest, of the two\r\nremaining installments was requested by the Portuguese Government, and\r\nas a consideration it offered to stipulate that rice of the United\r\nStates should be admitted into Portugal at the same duties as Brazilian\r\nrice. Being satisfied that no better arrangement could be made, my\r\nconsent was given, and a royal order of the King of Portugal was\r\naccordingly issued on February 4th, 1833 for the reduction of the duty\r\non rice of the United States. It would give me great pleasure if in\r\nspeaking of that country, in whose prosperity the United States are so\r\nmuch interested, and with whom a long-subsisting, extensive, and\r\nmutually advantageous commercial intercourse has strengthened the\r\nrelation of friendship, I could announce to you the restoration of its\r\ninternal tranquillity.\r\n\r\nSubsequently to the commencement of the last session of Congress the\r\nfinal installment payable by Denmark under the convention of March\r\n28th, 1830 was received. The commissioners for examining the claims\r\nhave since terminated their labors, and their awards have been paid at\r\nthe Treasury as they have been called for. The justice rendered to our\r\ncitizens by that Government is thus completed, and a pledge is thereby\r\nafforded for the maintenance of that friendly intercourse becoming the\r\nrelations that the two nations mutually bear to each other.\r\n\r\nIt is satisfactory to inform you that the Danish Government have\r\nrecently issued an ordinance by which the commerce with the island of\r\nSt. Croix is placed on a more liberal footing than heretofore. This\r\nchange can not fail to prove beneficial to the trade between the United\r\nStates and that colony, and the advantages likely to flow from it may\r\nlead to greater relaxations in the colonial systems of other nations.\r\n\r\nThe ratifications of the convention with the King of the two Sicilies\r\nhave been duly exchanged, and the commissioners appointed for examining\r\nthe claims under it have entered upon the duties assigned to them by\r\nlaw. The friendship that the interests of the two nations require of\r\nthem being now established, it may be hoped that each will enjoy the\r\nbenefits which a liberal commerce should yield to both.\r\n\r\nA treaty of amity and commerce between the United States and Belgium\r\nwas concluded during the last winter and received the sanction of the\r\nSenate, but the exchange of the ratifications has been hitherto\r\ndelayed, in consequence, in the first instance, of some delay in the\r\nreception of the treaty at Brussels, and, subsequently, of the absence\r\nof the Belgian minister of foreign affairs at the important conferences\r\nin which his Government is engaged at London. That treaty does but\r\nembody those enlarged principles of friendly policy which it is\r\nsincerely hoped will always regulate the conduct of the two nations\r\nhaving such strong motives to maintain amicable relations toward each\r\nother and so sincerely desirous to cherish them.\r\n\r\nWith all the other European powers with whom the United States have\r\nformed diplomatic relations and with the Sublime Porte the best\r\nunderstanding prevails. From all I continue to receive assurances of\r\ngood will toward the United States--assurances which it gives me no\r\nless pleasure to reciprocate than to receive. With all, the engagements\r\nwhich have been entered into are fulfilled with good faith on both\r\nsides. Measures have also been taken to enlarge our friendly relations\r\nand extend our commercial intercourse with other States. The system we\r\nhave pursued of aiming at no exclusive advantages, of dealing with all\r\non terms of fair and equal reciprocity, and of adhering scrupulously to\r\nall our engagements is well calculated to give success to efforts\r\nintended to be mutually beneficial.\r\n\r\nThe wars of which the southern part of this continent was so long the\r\ntheater, and which were carried on either by the mother country against\r\nthe States which had formerly been her colonies or by the States\r\nagainst each other, having terminated, and their civil dissensions\r\nhaving so far subsided as with few exceptions no longer to disturb the\r\npublic tranquillity, it is earnestly hoped those States will be able to\r\nemploy themselves without interruption in perfecting their\r\ninstitutions, cultivating the arts of peace, and promoting by wise\r\ncouncils and able exertions the public and private prosperity which\r\ntheir patriotic struggles so well entitle them to enjoy.\r\n\r\nWith those States our relations have under-gone but little change\r\nduring the present year. No reunion having yet taken place between the\r\nStates which composed the Republic of Colombia, our charge d'affaires\r\nat Bogota has been accredited to the Government of New Grenada, and we\r\nhave, therefore, no diplomatic relations with Venezuela and Equator,\r\nexcept as they may be included in those heretofore formed with the\r\nColombian Republic.\r\n\r\nIt is understood that representatives from the three states were about\r\nto assemble at Bogota to confer on the subject of their mutual\r\ninterests, particularly that of their union, and if the result should\r\nrender it necessary, measures will be taken on our part to preserve\r\nwith each that friendship and those liberal commercial connections\r\nwhich it has been the constant desire of the United States to cultivate\r\nwith their sister Republics of this hemisphere. Until the important\r\nquestion of reunion shall be settled, however, the different matters\r\nwhich have been under discussion between the United States and the\r\nRepublic of Colombia, or either of the States which composed it, are\r\nnot likely to be brought to a satisfactory issue.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the illness of the charge d'affaires appointed to\r\nCentral America at the last session of Congress, he was prevented from\r\nproceeding on his mission until the month of October. It is hoped,\r\nhowever, that he is by this time at his post, and that the official\r\nintercourse, unfortunately so long interrupted, has been thus renewed\r\non the part of the two nations so amicably and advantageously connected\r\nby engagements founded on the most enlarged principles of commercial\r\nreciprocity.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to state that since my last annual message some of the\r\nmost important claims of our fellow citizens upon the Government of\r\nBrazil have been satisfactorily adjusted, and a reliance is placed on\r\nthe friendly dispositions manifested by it that justice will also be\r\ndone in others. No new causes of complaint have arisen, and the trade\r\nbetween the two countries flourishes under the encouragement secured to\r\nit by the liberal provisions of the treaty.\r\n\r\nIt is cause of regret that, owing, probably, to the civil dissensions\r\nwhich have occupied the attention of the Mexican Government, the time\r\nfixed by the treaty of limits with the United States for the meeting of\r\nthe commissioners to define the boundaries between the two nations has\r\nbeen suffered to expire without the appointment of any commissioners on\r\nthe part of that Government. While the true boundary remains in doubt\r\nby either party it is difficult to give effect to those measures which\r\nare necessary to the protection and quiet of our numerous citizens\r\nresiding near that frontier. The subject is one of great solicitude to\r\nthe United States, and will not fail to receive my earnest attention.\r\n\r\nThe treaty concluded with Chili and approved by the Senate at its last\r\nsession was also ratified by the Chilian Government, but with certain\r\nadditional and explanatory articles of a nature to have required it to\r\nbe again submitted to the Senate. The time limited for the exchange of\r\nthe ratification, however, having since expired, the action of both\r\nGovernments on the treaty will again become necessary.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations commenced with the Argentine Republic relative to the\r\noutrages committed on our vessels engaged in the fisheries at the\r\nFalkland Islands by persons acting under the color of its authority, as\r\nwell as the other matters in controversy between the two Governments,\r\nhave been suspended by the departure of the charge d'affaires of the\r\nUnited States from Buenos Ayres. It is understood, however, that a\r\nminister was subsequently appointed by that Government to renew the\r\nnegotiation in the United States, but though daily expected he has not\r\nyet arrived in this country.\r\n\r\nWith Peru no treaty has yet been formed, and with Bolivia no diplomatic\r\nintercourse has yet been established. It will be my endeavor to\r\nencourage those sentiments of amity and that liberal commerce which\r\nbelong to the relations in which all the independent States of this\r\ncontinent stand toward each other.\r\n\r\nI deem it proper to recommend to your notice the revision of our\r\nconsular system. This has become an important branch of the public\r\nservice, in as much as it is intimately connected with the preservation\r\nof our national character abroad, with the interest of our citizens in\r\nforeign countries, with the regulation and care of our commerce, and\r\nwith the protection of our sea men. At the close of the last session of\r\nCongress I communicated a report from the Secretary of State upon the\r\nsubject, to which I now refer, as containing information which may be\r\nuseful in any inquiries that Congress may see fit to institute with a\r\nview to a salutary reform of the system.\r\n\r\nIt gives me great pleasure to congratulate you upon the prosperous\r\ncondition of the finances of the country, as will appear from the\r\nreport which the Secretary of the Treasury will in due time lay before\r\nyou. The receipts into the Treasury during the present year will amount\r\nto more than $32,000,000. The revenue derived from customs will, it is\r\nbelieved, be more than $28,000,000, and the public lands will yield\r\nabout $3,0900,000. The expenditures within the year for all objects,\r\nincluding $2,572,240.99 on account of the public debt, will not amount\r\nto $25,000,000, and a large balance will remain in the Treasury after\r\nsatisfying all the appropriations chargeable on the revenue for the\r\npresent year.\r\n\r\nThe measures taken by the Secretary of the Treasury will probably\r\nenable to pay off in the course of the present year the residue of the\r\nexchanged 4.5% stock, redeemable on January 1st, 1834. It has therefore\r\nbeen included in the estimated expenditures of this year, and forms a\r\npart of the sum above stated to have been paid on account of the public\r\ndebt. The payment of this stock will reduce the whole debt of the\r\nUnited States, funded and unfunded, to the sum of $4,760,082.08, and as\r\nprovision has already been made for the 4.5% stocks above mentioned,\r\nand charged in the expenses of the present year, the sum last stated is\r\nall that now remains of the national debt; and the revenue of the\r\ncoming year, together with the balance now in the Treasury, will be\r\nsufficient to discharge it, after meeting the current expenses of the\r\nGovernment. Under the power given to the commissioners of the sinking\r\nfund, it will, I have no doubt, be purchased on favorable terms within\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\nFrom this view of the state of the finances and the public engagements\r\nyet to be fulfilled you will perceive that if Providence permits me to\r\nmeet you at another session I shall have the high gratification of\r\nannouncing to you that the national debt is extinguished. I can not\r\nrefrain from expressing the pleasure I feel at the near approach of\r\nthat desirable event. The short period of time within which the public\r\ndebt will have been discharged is strong evidence of the abundant\r\nresources of the country and of the prudence and economy with which the\r\nGovernment has heretofore been administered. We have waged two wars\r\nsince we became a nation, with one of the most powerful kingdoms in the\r\nworld, both of them undertaken in defense of our dearest rights, been\r\nsuccessfully prosecuted and honorably terminated; and many of those who\r\npartook in the first struggle as well as in the second will have lived\r\nto see the last item of the debt incurred in these necessary but\r\nexpensive conflicts faithfully and honestly discharged. And we shall\r\nhave the proud satisfaction of bequeathing to the public servants who\r\nfollow us in the administration of the Government the rare blessing of\r\na revenue sufficiently abundant, raised without injustice or oppression\r\nto our citizens, and unencumbered with any burdens but what they\r\nthemselves shall think proper to impose upon it.\r\n\r\nThe flourishing state of the finances ought not, however, to encourage\r\nus to indulge in a lavish expenditure of the public treasure. The\r\nreceipts of the present year do not furnish the test by which we are to\r\nestimate the income of the next. The changes made in our revenue system\r\nby the acts of Congress of 1832 and 1833, and more especially by the\r\nformer, have swelled the receipts of the present year far beyond the\r\namount to be expected in future years upon the reduced tariff of\r\nduties. The shortened credits on revenue bonds and the cash duties on\r\nwoolens which were introduced by the act of 1832, and took effect on\r\nMarch 4th, 1832, have brought large sums into the Treasury in 1833,\r\nwhich, according to the credits formerly given, would not have been\r\npayable until 1834, and would have formed a part of the income of that\r\nyear. These causes would of themselves produce a great diminution of\r\nthe receipts in the year 1834 as compared with the present one, and\r\nthey will be still more diminished by the reduced rates of duties which\r\ntake place on January 1st, 1834 on some of the most important and\r\nproductive articles.\r\n\r\nUpon the best estimates that can be made the receipts of the next year,\r\nwith the aid of the unappropriated amount now in the Treasury, will not\r\nbe much more than sufficient to meet the expenses of the year and pay\r\nthe small remnant of the national debt which yet remains unsatisfied. I\r\ncan not, therefore, recommend to you any alteration in the present\r\ntariff of duties. The rate as now fixed by law on the various articles\r\nwas adopted at the last session of Congress, as a matter of compromise,\r\nwith unusual unanimity, and unless it is found to produce more than the\r\nnecessities of the Government call for there would seem to be no reason\r\nat this time to justify a change.\r\n\r\nBut while I forbear to recommend any further reduction of the duties\r\nbeyond that already provided for by the existing laws, I must earnestly\r\nand respectfully press upon Congress the importance of abstaining from\r\nall appropriations which are not absolutely required for the public\r\ninterest and authorized by the powers clearly delegated to the United\r\nStates. We are beginning a new era in our Government. The national\r\ndebt, which has so long been a burden on the Treasury, will be finally\r\ndischarged in the course of the ensuing year. No more memory will\r\nafterwards be needed than what may be necessary to meet the ordinary\r\nexpenses of the Government. Now, then, is the proper moment to fix our\r\nsystem of expenditure on firm and durable principles, and I can not too\r\nstrongly urge the necessity of a rigid economy and an inflexible\r\ndetermination not to enlarge the income beyond the real necessities of\r\nthe Government and not to increase the wants of the Government by\r\nunnecessary and profuse expenditures.\r\n\r\nIf a contrary course should be pursued, it may happen that the revenue\r\nof 1834 will fall short of the demands upon it, and after reducing the\r\ntariff in order to lighten the burdens of the people, and providing for\r\na still further reduction to take effect hereafter, it would be much to\r\nbe deplored if at the end of another year we should find ourselves\r\nobliged to retrace our steps and impose additional taxes to meet\r\nunnecessary expenditures.\r\n\r\nIt is my duty on this occasion to call your attention to the\r\ndestruction of the public building occupied by the Treasury Department,\r\nwhich happened since the last adjournment of Congress. A thorough\r\ninquiry into the causes of this loss was directed and made at the time,\r\nthe result of which will be duly communicated to you. I take pleasure,\r\nhowever, in stating here that by the laudable exertions of the officers\r\nof the Department and many of the citizens of the District but few\r\npapers were lost, and none that will materially affect the public\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe public convenience requires that another building should be erected\r\nas soon as practicable, and in providing for it it will be advisable to\r\nenlarge in some manner the accommodations for the public officers of\r\nthe several Departments, and to authorize the erection of suitable\r\ndepositories for the safe-keeping of the public documents and records.\r\n\r\nSince the last adjournment of Congress the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nhas directed the money of the United States to be deposited in certain\r\nState banks designated by him, and he will immediately lay before you\r\nhis reasons for this direction. I concur with him entirely in the view\r\nhe has taken on the subject, and some months before the removal I urged\r\nupon the Department the propriety of taking that step. The near\r\napproach of the day on which the charger will expire, as well as the\r\nconduct of the bank, appeared to me to call for this measure upon the\r\nhigh considerations of public interest and public duty. The extent of\r\nits misconduct, however, although known to be great, was not at that\r\ntime fully developed by proof. It was not until late in the month of\r\nAugust that I received from the Government directors an official report\r\nestablishing beyond question that this great and powerful institution\r\nhad been actively engaged in attempting to influence the elections of\r\nthe public officers by means of its money, and that, in violation of\r\nthe express provisions of its charter, it had by a formal resolution\r\nplaced its funds at the disposition of its president to be employed in\r\nsustaining the political power of the bank. A copy of this resolution\r\nis contained in the report of the Government directors before referred\r\nto, and how ever the object may be disguised by cautious language, no\r\none can doubt that this money was in truth intended for electioneering\r\npurposes, and the particular uses to which it was proved to have been\r\napplied abundantly show that it was so understood. Not only was the\r\nevidence complete as to the past application of the money and power of\r\nthe bank to electioneering purposes, but that the resolution of the\r\nboard of directors authorized the same course to be pursued in future.\r\n\r\nIt being thus established by unquestionable proof that the Bank of the\r\nUnited States was converted into a permanent electioneering engine, it\r\nappeared to me that the path of duty which the executive department of\r\nthe Government ought to pursue was not doubtful. As by the terms of the\r\nbank charter no officer but the Secretary of the Treasury could remove\r\nthe deposits, it seemed to me that this authority ought to be at once\r\nexerted to deprive that great corporation of the support and\r\ncountenance of the Government in such an use of its and such an\r\nexertion of its power. In this point of the case the question is\r\ndistinctly presented whether the people of the United States are to\r\ngovern through representatives chosen by their unbiased suffrages or\r\nwhether the money and power of a great corporation are to be secretly\r\nexerted to influence their judgment and control their decisions. It\r\nmust now be determined whether the bank is to have its candidates for\r\nall offices in the country, from the highest to the lowest, or whether\r\ncandidates on both sides of political questions shall be brought\r\nforward as heretofore and supported by the usual means.\r\n\r\nAt this time the efforts of the bank to control public opinion, through\r\nthe distresses of some and the fears of others, are equally apparent,\r\nand, if possible, more objectionable. By a curtailment of its\r\naccommodations more rapid than any emergency requires, and even while\r\nit retains specie to an almost unprecedented amount in its vaults, it\r\nis attempting to produce great embarrassment in one portion of the\r\ncommunity, while through presses known to have been sustained by its\r\nmoney it attempts by unfounded alarms to create a panic in all.\r\n\r\nThese are the means by which it seems to expect that it can force a\r\nrestoration of the deposits, and as a necessary consequence extort from\r\nCongress a renewal of its charter. I am happy to know that through the\r\ngood sense of our people the effort to get up a panic has hitherto\r\nfailed, and that through the increased accommodations which the State\r\nbanks have been enabled to afford, no public distress has followed the\r\nexertions of the bank, and it can not be doubted that the exercise of\r\nits power and the expenditure of its money, as well as its efforts to\r\nspread groundless alarm, will be met and rebuked as they deserve. In my\r\nown sphere of duty I should feel myself called on by the facts\r\ndisclosed to order a scire facias against the bank, with a view to put\r\nan end to the chartered rights it has so palpably violated, were it not\r\nthat the charter itself will expire as soon as a decision would\r\nprobably be obtained from the court of last resort.\r\n\r\nI called the attention of Congress to this subject in my last annual\r\nmessage, and informed them that such measures as were within the reach\r\nof the Secretary of the Treasury had been taken to enable him to judge\r\nwhether the public deposits in the Bank of the United States were\r\nentirely safe; but that as his single powers might be inadequate to the\r\nobject, I recommended the subject to Congress as worthy of their\r\nserious investigation, declaring it as my opinion that an inquiry into\r\nthe transactions of that institution, embracing the branches as well as\r\nthe principal bank, was called for by the credit which was given\r\nthroughout the country to many serious charges impeaching their\r\ncharacter, and which, if true, might justly excite the apprehension\r\nthat they were no longer a safe depository for the public money. The\r\nextent to which the examination thus recommended was gone into is\r\nspread upon your journals, and is too well known to require to be\r\nstated. Such as was made resulted in a report from a majority of the\r\nCommittee of Ways and Means touching certain specified points only,\r\nconcluding with a resolution that the Government deposits might safely\r\nbe continued in the Bank of the United States. This resolution was\r\nadopted at the close of the session by the vote of a majority of the\r\nHouse of Representatives.\r\n\r\nAlthough I may not always be able to concur in the views of the public\r\ninterest or the duties of its agents which may be taken by the other\r\ndepartments of the Government or either of its branches, I am, not\r\nwithstanding, wholly incapable of receiving otherwise than with the\r\nmost sincere respect all opinions or suggestions proceeding from such a\r\nsource, and in respect to none am I more inclined to do so than to the\r\nHouse of Representatives. But it will be seen from the brief views at\r\nthis time taken of the subject by myself, as well as the more ample\r\nones presented by the Secretary of the Treasury, that the change in the\r\ndeposits which has been ordered has been deemed to be called for by\r\nconsiderations which are not affected by the proceedings referred to,\r\nand which, if correctly viewed by that Department, rendered its act a\r\nmatter of imperious duty.\r\n\r\nComing as you do, for the most part, immediately from the people and\r\nthe States by election, and possessing the fullest opportunity to know\r\ntheir sentiments, the present Congress will be sincerely solicitous to\r\ncarry into full and fair effect the will of their constituents in\r\nregard to this institution. It will be for those in whose behalf we all\r\nact to decide whether the executive department of the Government, in\r\nthe steps which it has taken on this subject, has been found in the\r\nline of its duty.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying report of the Secretary of War, with the documents\r\nannexed to it, exhibits the operations of the War Department for the\r\npast year and the condition of the various subjects intrusted to its\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from them that the Army maintains the character it has\r\nheretofore acquired for efficiency and military knowledge. Nothing has\r\noccurred since your last session to require its services beyond the\r\nordinary routine duties which upon the sea-board and the in-land\r\nfrontier devolve upon it in a time of peace. The system so wisely\r\nadopted and so long pursued of constructing fortifications at exposed\r\npoints and of preparing and collecting the supplies necessary for the\r\nmilitary defense of the country, and thus providently furnishing in\r\npeace the means of defense in war, has been continued with the usual\r\nresults. I recommend to your consideration the various subjects\r\nsuggested in the report of the Secretary of War. Their adoption would\r\npromote the public service and meliorate the condition of the Army.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the various Indian tribes have been undisturbed\r\nsince the termination of the difficulties growing out of the hostile\r\naggressions of the Sac and Fox Indians. Several treaties have been\r\nformed for the relinquishment of territory to the United States and for\r\nthe migration of the occupants of the region assigned for their\r\nresidence West of the Mississippi. Should these treaties be ratified by\r\nthe Senate, provision will have been made for the removal of almost all\r\nthe tribes remaining E of that river and for the termination of many\r\ndifficult and embarrassing questions arising out of their anomalous\r\npolitical condition.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that those portions of two of the Southern tribes,\r\nwhich in that event will present the only remaining difficulties, will\r\nrealize the necessity of emigration, and will speedily resort to it. My\r\noriginal convictions upon this subject have been confirmed by the\r\ncourse of events for several years, and experience is every day adding\r\nto their strength. That those tribes can not exist surrounded by our\r\nsettlements and in continual contact with our citizens is certain. They\r\nhave neither the intelligence, the industry, the moral habits, nor the\r\ndesire of improvement which are essential to any favorable change in\r\ntheir condition. Established in the midst of another and a superior\r\nrace, and without appreciating the causes of their inferiority or\r\nseeking to control them, they must necessarily yield to the force of\r\ncircumstances and ere long disappear.\r\n\r\nSuch has been their fate heretofore, and if it is to be averted--and it\r\nis--it can only be done by a general removal beyond our boundary and by\r\nthe reorganization of their political system upon principles adapted to\r\nthe new relations in which they will be placed. The experiment which\r\nhas been recently made has so far proved successful. The emigrants\r\ngenerally are represented to be prosperous and contented, the country\r\nsuitable to their wants and habits, and the essential articles of\r\nsubsistence easily procured. When the report of the commissioners now\r\nengaged in investigating the condition and prospects of these Indians\r\nand in devising a plan for their intercourse and government is\r\nreceived, I trust ample means of information will be in possession of\r\nthe Government for adjusting all the unsettled questions connected with\r\nthis interesting subject.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Navy during the year and its present condition\r\nare fully exhibited in the annual report from the Navy Department.\r\n\r\nSuggestions are made by the Secretary of various improvements, which\r\ndeserve careful consideration, and most of which, if adopted, bid fair\r\nto promote the efficiency of this important branch of the public\r\nservice. Among these are the new organization of the Navy Board, the\r\nrevision of the pay to officers, and a change in the period of time or\r\nin the manner of making the annual appropriations, to which I beg leave\r\nto call your particular attention.\r\n\r\nThe views which are presented on almost every portion of our naval\r\nconcerns, and especially on the amount of force and the number of\r\nofficers, and the general course of policy appropriate in the present\r\nstate of our country for securing the great and useful purposes of\r\nnaval protection in peace and due preparation for the contingencies of\r\nwar, meet with my entire approbation.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived from the report referred to that the fiscal\r\nconcerns of the establishment are in an excellent condition, and it is\r\nhoped that Congress may feel disposed to make promptly every suitable\r\nprovision desired either for preserving or improving the system.\r\n\r\nThe general Post Office Department has continued, upon the strength of\r\nits own resources, to facilitate the means of communication between the\r\nvarious portions of the Union with increased activity. The method,\r\nhowever, in which the accounts of the transportation of the mail have\r\nalways been kept appears to have presented an imperfect view of its\r\nexpenses. It has recently been discovered that from the earliest\r\nrecords of the Department the annual statements have been calculated to\r\nexhibit an amount considerably short of the actual expense incurred for\r\nthat service. These illusory statements, together with the expense of\r\ncarrying into effect the law of the last session of Congress\r\nestablishing new mail routes, and a disposition on the part of the head\r\nof the Department to gratify the wishes of the public in the extension\r\nof mail facilities, have induced him to incur responsibilities for\r\ntheir improvement beyond what the current resources of the Department\r\nwould sustain. As soon as he had discovered the imperfection of the\r\nmethod he caused an investigation to be made of its results and applied\r\nthe proper remedy to correct the evil. It became necessary for him to\r\nwithdraw some of the improvements which he had made to bring the\r\nexpenses of the Department within its own resources. These expenses\r\nwere incurred for the public good, and the public have enjoyed their\r\nbenefit. They are now but partially suspended, and that where they may\r\nbe discontinued with the least inconvenience to the country.\r\n\r\nThe progressive increase in the income from postages has equaled the\r\nhighest expectations, and it affords demonstrative evidence of the\r\ngrowing importance and great utility of this Department. The details\r\nare exhibited in the accompanying report of the Post Master General.\r\n\r\nThe many distressing accidents which have of late occurred in that\r\nportion of our navigation carried on by the use of steam power deserve\r\nthe immediate and unremitting attention of the constituted authorities\r\nof the country. The fact that the number of those fatal disasters is\r\nconstantly increasing, not withstanding the great improvements which\r\nare every where made in the machinery employed and in the rapid\r\nadvances which have made in that branch of science, shows very clearly\r\nthat they are in a great degree the result of criminal negligence on\r\nthe part of those by whom the vessels are navigated and to whose care\r\nand attention the lives and property of our citizens are so extensively\r\nintrusted.\r\n\r\nThat these evils may be greatly lessened, if not substantially removed,\r\nby means of precautionary and penal legislation seems to be highly\r\nprobably. So far, therefore, as the subject can be regarded as within\r\nthe constitutional purview of Congress I earnestly recommend it to your\r\nprompt and serious consideration.\r\n\r\nI would also call your attention to the views I have heretofore\r\nexpressed of the propriety of amending the Constitution in relation to\r\nthe mode of electing the President and the Vice-President of the United\r\nStates. Regarding it as all important to the future quiet and harmony\r\nof the people that every intermediate agency in the election of these\r\nofficers should be removed and that their eligibility should be limited\r\nto one term of either four or six years, I can not too earnestly invite\r\nyour consideration of the subject.\r\n\r\nTrusting that your deliberations on all the topics of general interest\r\nto which I have adverted, and such others as your more extensive\r\nknowledge of the wants of our beloved country may suggest, may be\r\ncrowned with success, I tender you in conclusion the cooperation which\r\nit may be in my power to afford them.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nAndrew Jackson\r\nDecember 1, 1834\r\n\r\nFellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nIn performing my duty at the opening of your present session it gives\r\nme pleasure to congratulate you again upon the prosperous condition of\r\nour beloved country. Divine Providence has favored us with general\r\nhealth, with rich rewards in the fields of agriculture and in every\r\nbranch of labor, and with peace to cultivate and extend the various\r\nresources which employ the virtue and enterprise of our citizens. Let\r\nus trust that in surveying a scene so flattering to our free\r\ninstitutions our joint deliberations to preserve them may be crowned\r\nwith success.\r\n\r\nOur foreign relations continue, with but few exceptions, to maintain\r\nthe favorable aspect which they bore in my last annual message, and\r\npromise to extend those advantages which the principles that regulate\r\nour intercourse with other nations are so well calculated to secure.\r\n\r\nThe question of our North East boundary is still pending with Great\r\nBritain, and the proposition made in accordance with the resolution of\r\nthe Senate for the establishment of a line according to the treaty of\r\n1783 has not been accepted by that Government. Believing that every\r\ndisposition is felt on both sides to adjust this perplexing question to\r\nthe satisfaction of all the parties interested in it, the hope is yet\r\nindulged that it may be effected on the basis of that proposition.\r\n\r\nWith the Governments of Austria, Russia, Prussia, Holland, Sweden, and\r\nDenmark the best understanding exists. Commerce with all is fostered\r\nand protected by reciprocal good will under the sanction of liberal\r\nconventional or legal provisions.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of her internal difficulties the Queen of Spain has\r\nratified the convention for the payment of the claims of our citizens\r\narising since 1819. It is in the course of execution on her part, and a\r\ncopy of it is now laid before you for such legislation as may be found\r\nnecessary to enable those interested to derive the benefits of it.\r\n\r\nYielding to the force of circumstances and to the wise counsels of time\r\nand experience, that power has finally resolved no longer to occupy the\r\nunnatural position in which she stood to the new Governments\r\nestablished in this hemisphere. I have the great satisfaction of\r\nstating to you that in preparing the way for the restoration of harmony\r\nbetween those who have sprung from the same ancestors, who are allied\r\nby common interests, profess the same religion, and speak the same\r\nlanguage the United States have been actively instrumental. Our efforts\r\nto effect this good work will be persevered in while they are deemed\r\nuseful to the parties and our entire disinterestedness continues to be\r\nfelt and understood. The act of Congress to countervail the\r\ndiscriminating duties to the prejudice of our navigation levied in Cuba\r\nand Puerto Rico has been transmitted to the minister of the United\r\nStates at Madrid, to be communicated to the Government of the Queen. No\r\nintelligence of its receipt has yet reached the Department of State. If\r\nthe present condition of the country permits the Government to make a\r\ncareful and enlarged examination of the true interests of these\r\nimportant portions of its dominions, no doubt is entertained that their\r\nfuture intercourse with the United States will be placed upon a more\r\njust and liberal basis.\r\n\r\nThe Florida archives have not yet been selected and delivered. Recent\r\norders have been sent to the agent of the United States at Havana to\r\nreturn with all that he can obtain, so that they may be in Washington\r\nbefore the session of the Supreme Court, to be used in the legal\r\nquestions there pending to which the Government is a party.\r\n\r\nInternal tranquillity is happily restored to Portugal. The distracted\r\nstate of the country rendered unavoidable the postponement of a final\r\npayment of the just claims of our citizens. Our diplomatic relations\r\nwill be soon resumed, and the long-subsisting friendship with that\r\npower affords the strongest guaranty that the balance due will receive\r\nprompt attention.\r\n\r\nThe first installment due under the convention of indemnity with the\r\nKing of the Two Sicilies has been duly received, and an offer has been\r\nmade to extinguish the whole by a prompt payment--an offer I did not\r\nconsider myself authorized to accept, as the indemnification provided\r\nis the exclusive property of individual citizens of the United States.\r\nThe original adjustment of our claims and the anxiety displayed to\r\nfulfill at once the stipulations made for the payment of them are\r\nhighly honorable to the Government of the Two Sicilies. When it is\r\nrecollected that they were the result of the injustice of an intrusive\r\npower temporarily dominant in its territory, a repugnance to\r\nacknowledge and to pay which would have been neither unnatural nor\r\nunexpected, the circumstances can not fail to exalt its character for\r\njustice and good faith in the eyes of all nations.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of amity and commerce between the United States and Belgium,\r\nbrought to your notice in my last annual message as sanctioned by the\r\nSenate, but the ratifications of which had not been exchanged owing to\r\na delay in its reception at Brussels and a subsequent absence of the\r\nBelgian minister of foreign affairs, has been, after mature\r\ndeliberation, finally disavowed by that Government as inconsistent with\r\nthe powers and instructions given to their minister who negotiated it.\r\nThis disavowal was entirely unexpected, as the liberal principles\r\nembodied in the convention, and which form the ground-work of the\r\nobjections to it, were perfectly satisfactory to the Belgian\r\nrepresentative, and were supposed to be not only within the powers\r\ngranted, but expressly conformable to the instructions given to him. An\r\noffer, not yet accepted, has been made by Belgium to renew negotiations\r\nfor a treaty less liberal in its provisions on questions of general\r\nmaritime law.\r\n\r\nOur newly established relations with the Sublime Porte promise to be\r\nuseful to our commerce and satisfactory in every respect to this\r\nGovernment. Our intercourse with the Barbary Powers continues without\r\nimportant change, except that the present political state of Algiers\r\nhas induced me to terminate the residence there of a salaried consul\r\nand to substitute an ordinary consulate, to remain so long as the place\r\ncontinues in the possession of France. Our first treaty with one of\r\nthese powers, the Emperor of Morocco, was formed in 1786, and was\r\nlimited to fifty years. That period has almost expired. I shall take\r\nmeasures to renew it with the greater satisfaction as its stipulations\r\nare just and liberal and have been, with mutual fidelity and reciprocal\r\nadvantage, scrupulously fulfilled.\r\n\r\nIntestine dissensions have too frequently occurred to mar the\r\nprosperity, interrupt the commerce, and distract the governments of\r\nmost of the nations of this hemisphere which have separated themselves\r\nfrom Spain. When a firm and permanent understanding with the parent\r\ncountry shall have produced a formal acknowledgment of their\r\nindependence, and the idea of danger from that quarter can be no longer\r\nentertained, the friends of freedom expect that those countries, so\r\nfavored by nature, will be distinguished for their love of justice and\r\ntheir devotion to those peaceful arts the assiduous cultivation of\r\nwhich confers honor upon nations and gives value to human life.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time I confidently hope that the apprehensions entertained\r\nthat some of the people of these luxuriant regions may be tempted, in a\r\nmoment of unworthy distrust of their own capacity for the enjoyment of\r\nliberty, to commit the too common error of purchasing present repose by\r\nbestowing on some favorite leaders the fatal gift of irresponsible\r\npower will not be realized. With all these Governments and with that of\r\nBrazil no unexpected changes in our relations have occurred during the\r\npresent year.\r\n\r\nFrequent causes of just complaint have arisen upon the part of the\r\ncitizens of the United States, some times from the irregular action of\r\nthe constituted subordinate authorities of the maritime regions and\r\nsome times from the leaders or partisans of those in arms against the\r\nestablished Governments. In all cases representations have been or will\r\nbe made, and as soon as their political affairs are in a settled\r\nposition it is expected that our friendly remonstrances will be\r\nfollowed by adequate redress.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Mexico made known in December last the appointment of\r\ncommissioners and a surveyor on its part to run, in conjunction with\r\nours, the boundary line between its territories and the United States,\r\nand excused the delay for the reasons anticipated--the prevalence of\r\ncivil war. The commissioners and surveyors not having met within the\r\ntime stipulated by the treaty, a new arrangement became necessary, and\r\nour charge d'affaires was instructed in January, 1833 to negotiate in\r\nMexico an article additional to the pre-existing treaty. This\r\ninstruction was acknowledged, and no difficulty was apprehended in the\r\naccomplishment of that object. By information just received that\r\nadditional article to the treaty will be obtained and transmitted to\r\nthis country as soon as it can receive the ratification of the Mexican\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe reunion of the three States of New Grenada, Venezuela, and Equador,\r\nforming the Republic of Colombia, seems every day to become more\r\nimprobable. The commissioners of the two first are understood to be now\r\nnegotiating a just division of the obligations contracted by them when\r\nunited under one government. The civil war in Equador, it is believed,\r\nhas prevented even the appointment of a commissioner on its part.\r\n\r\nI propose at an early day to submit, in the proper form, the\r\nappointment of a diplomatic agent to Venezuela, the importance of the\r\ncommerce of that country to the United States and the large claims of\r\nour citizens upon the Government arising before and since the division\r\nof Colombia rendering it, in my judgment, improper longer to delay this\r\nstep.\r\n\r\nOur representatives to Central America, Peru, and Brazil are either at\r\nor on their way to their respective posts.\r\n\r\nFrom the Argentine Republic, from which a minister was expected to this\r\nGovernment, nothing further has been heard. Occasion has been taken on\r\nthe departure of a new consul to Buenos Ayres to remind that Government\r\nthat its long delayed minister, whose appointment had been made known\r\nto us, had not arrived.\r\n\r\nIt becomes my unpleasant duty to inform you that this pacific and\r\nhighly gratifying picture of our foreign relations does not include\r\nthose with France at this time. It is not possible that any Government\r\nand people could be more sincerely desirous of conciliating a just and\r\nfriendly intercourse with another nation than are those of the United\r\nStates with their ancient ally and friend. This disposition is founded\r\nas well on the most grateful and honorable recollections associated\r\nwith our struggle for independence as upon a well grounded conviction\r\nthat it is consonant with the true policy of both. The people of the\r\nUnited States could not, therefore, see without the deepest regret even\r\na temporary interruption of the friendly relations between the two\r\ncountries--a regret which would, I am sure, be greatly aggravated if\r\nthere should turn out to be any reasonable ground for attributing such\r\na result to any act of omission or commission on our part. I derive,\r\ntherefore, the highest satisfaction from being able to assure you that\r\nthe whole course of this Government has been characterized by a spirit\r\nso conciliatory and for bearing as to make it impossible that our\r\njustice and moderation should be questioned, what ever may be the\r\nconsequences of a longer perseverance on the part of the French\r\nGovernment in her omission to satisfy the conceded claims of our\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nThe history of the accumulated and unprovoked aggressions upon our\r\ncommerce committed by authority of the existing Governments of France\r\nbetween the years 1800 and 1817 has been rendered too painfully\r\nfamiliar to Americans to make its repetition either necessary or\r\ndesirable. It will be sufficient here to remark that there has for many\r\nyears been scarcely a single administration of the French Government by\r\nwhom the justice and legality of the claims of our citizens to\r\nindemnity were not to a very considerable extent admitted, and yet near\r\na quarter of a century has been wasted in ineffectual negotiations to\r\nsecure it.\r\n\r\nDeeply sensible of the injurious effects resulting from this state of\r\nthings upon the interests and character of both nations, I regarded it\r\nas among my first duties to cause one more effort to be made to satisfy\r\nFrance that a just and liberal settlement of our claims was as well due\r\nto her own honor as to their incontestable validity. The negotiation\r\nfor this purpose was commenced with the late Government of France, and\r\nwas prosecuted with such success as to leave no reasonable ground to\r\ndoubt that a settlement of a character quite as liberal as that which\r\nwas subsequently made would have been effected had not the revolution\r\nby which the negotiation was cut off taken place. The discussions were\r\nresumed with the present Government, and the result showed that we were\r\nnot wrong in supposing that an event by which the two Governments were\r\nmade to approach each other so much nearer in their political\r\nprinciples, and by which the motives for the most liberal and friendly\r\nintercourse were so greatly multiplied, could exercise no other than a\r\nsalutary influence upon the negotiation.\r\n\r\nAfter the most deliberate and thorough examination of the whole subject\r\na treaty between the two Governments was concluded and signed at Paris\r\non July 4th, 1831, by which it was stipulated that \"the French\r\nGovernment, in order to liberate itself from all the reclamations\r\npreferred against it by citizens of the United States for unlawful\r\nseizures, captures, sequestrations, confiscations, or destruction of\r\ntheir vessels, cargoes, or other property, engages to pay a sum of\r\n25,000,000 francs to the United States, who shall distribute it among\r\nthose entitled in the manner and according to the rules it shall\r\ndetermine\"; and it was also stipulated on the part of the French\r\nGovernment that this 25,000,000 francs should be paid at Paris, in six\r\nannual installments of 4,166,666 francs and 66 centimes each, into the\r\nhands of such person or persons \"as shall be authorized by the\r\nGovernment of the United States to receive it\", the first installment\r\nto be paid \"at the expiration of one year next following the exchange\r\nof the ratifications of this convention and the others at successive\r\nintervals of a year, one after another, 'til the whole shall be paid.\r\nTo the amount of each of the said installments shall be added interest\r\nat 4% thereupon, as upon the other installments then remaining unpaid,\r\nthe said interest to be computed from the day of the exchange of the\r\npresent convention\".\r\n\r\nIt was also stipulated on the part of the United States, for the\r\npurpose of being completely liberated from all the reclamations\r\npresented by France on behalf of its citizens, that the sum of\r\n1,500,000 francs should be paid to the Government of France in six\r\nannual installments, to be deducted out of the annual sums which France\r\nhad agreed to pay, interest thereupon being in like manner computed\r\nfrom the day of the exchange of the ratifications. In addition to this\r\nstipulation, important advantages were secured to France by the\r\nfollowing article, viz: The wines of France, from and after the\r\nexchange of the ratifications of the present conventions, shall be\r\nadmitted to consumption in the States of the Union at duties which\r\nshall not exceed the following rates by the gallon (such as it is used\r\nat present for wines in the United States), to wit: six cents for red\r\nwines in casks; ten cents for white wines in casks, and 22 cents for\r\nwines of all sorts in bottles. The proportions existing between the\r\nduties on French wines thus reduced and the general rates of the tariff\r\nwhich went into operation January 1st, 1829, shall be maintained in\r\ncase the Government of the United States should think proper to\r\ndiminish those general rates in a new tariff.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of this stipulation, which shall be binding on the\r\nUnited States for ten years, the French Government abandons the\r\nreclamations which it had formed in relation to the 8th article of the\r\ntreaty of cession of Louisiana. It engages, moreover, to establish on\r\nthe long-staple cottons of the United States which after the exchange\r\nof the ratifications of the present convention shall be brought\r\ndirectly thence to France by the vessels of the United States or by\r\nFrench vessels the same duties as on short-staple cotton. This treaty\r\nwas duly ratified in the manner prescribed by the constitutions of both\r\ncountries, and the ratification was exchanged at the city of Washington\r\non February 2d, 1832. On account of its commercial stipulations it was\r\nin five days thereafter laid before the Congress of the United States,\r\nwhich proceeded to enact such laws favorable to the commerce of France\r\nas were necessary to carry it into full execution, and France has from\r\nthat period to the present been in the unrestricted enjoyment of the\r\nvaluable privileges that were thus secured to her.\r\n\r\nThe faith of the French nation having been thus solemnly pledged\r\nthrough its constitutional organ for the liquidation and ultimate\r\npayment of the long deferred claims of our citizens, as also for the\r\nadjustment of other points of great and reciprocal benefits to both\r\ncountries, and the United States having, with a fidelity and\r\npromptitude by which their conduct will, I trust, be always\r\ncharacterized, done every thing that was necessary to carry the treaty\r\ninto full and fair effect on their part, counted with the most perfect\r\nconfidence on equal fidelity and promptitude on the part of the French\r\nGovernment. In this reasonable expectation we have been, I regret to\r\ninform you, wholly disappointed. No legislative provision has been made\r\nby France for the execution of the treaty, either as it respects the\r\nindemnity to be paid or the commercial benefits to be secured to the\r\nUnited States, and the relations between the United States and that\r\npower in consequence thereof are placed in a situation threatening to\r\ninterrupt the good understanding which has so long and so happily\r\nexisted between the two nations.\r\n\r\nNot only has the French Government been thus wanting in the performance\r\nof the stipulations it has so solemnly entered into with the United\r\nStates, but its omissions have been marked by circumstances which would\r\nseem to leave us without satisfactory evidences that such performance\r\nwill certainly take place at a future period. Advice of the exchange of\r\nratifications reached Paris prior to April 8th, 1832. The French\r\nChambers were then sitting, and continued in session until April 21st,\r\n1832, and although one installment of the indemnity was payable on\r\nFebruary 2d, 1833, one year after the exchange of ratifications, no\r\napplication was made to the Chambers for the required appropriation,\r\nand in consequence of no appropriation having then been made the draft\r\nof the United States Government for that installment was dishonored by\r\nthe minister of finance, and the United States thereby involved in much\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\nThe next session of the Chambers commenced on November 19th, 1832, and\r\ncontinued until April 25th, 1833. Not withstanding the omission to pay\r\nthe first installment had been made the subject of earnest remonstrance\r\non our part, the treaty with the United States and a bill making the\r\nnecessary appropriations to execute it were not laid before the Chamber\r\nof Deputies until April 6th, 1833, nearly five months after its\r\nmeeting, and only nineteen days before the close of the session. The\r\nbill was read and referred to a committee, but there was no further\r\naction upon it.\r\n\r\nThe next session of the Chambers commenced on April 26th, 1833, and\r\ncontinued until June 26th, 1833. A new bill was introduced on June\r\n11th, 1833, but nothing important was done in relation to it during the\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nIn 1834 April, nearly three years after the signature of the treaty,\r\nthe final action of the French Chambers upon the bill to carry the\r\ntreaty into effect was obtained, and resulted in a refusal of the\r\nnecessary appropriations. The avowed grounds upon which the bill was\r\nrejected are to be found in the published debates of that body, and no\r\nobservations of mine can be necessary to satisfy Congress of their\r\nutter insufficiency. Although the gross amount of the claims of our\r\ncitizens is probably greater than will be ultimately allowed by the\r\ncommissioners, sufficient is, never the less, shown to render it\r\nabsolutely certain that the indemnity falls far short of the actual\r\namount of our just claims, independently of the question of damages and\r\ninterest for the detention. That the settlement involved a sacrifice in\r\nthis respect was well known at the time--a sacrifice which was\r\ncheerfully acquiesced in by the different branches of the Federal\r\nGovernment, whose action upon the treaty was required from a sincere\r\ndesire to avoid further collision upon this old and disturbing subject\r\nand in the confident expectation that the general relations between the\r\ntwo countries would be improved thereby.\r\n\r\nThe refusal to vote the appropriation, the news of which was received\r\nfrom our minister in Paris about May 15th, 1834, might have been\r\nconsidered the final determination of the French Government not to\r\nexecute the stipulations of the treaty, and would have justified an\r\nimmediate communication of the facts to Congress, with a recommendation\r\nof such ultimate measures as the interest and honor of the United\r\nStates might seem to require. But with the news of the refusal of the\r\nChambers to make the appropriation were conveyed the regrets of the\r\nKing and a declaration that a national vessel should be forthwith sent\r\nout with instructions to the French minister to give the most ample\r\nexplanations of the past and the strongest assurances for the future.\r\nAfter a long passage the promised dispatch vessel arrived.\r\n\r\nThe pledges given by the French minister upon receipt of his\r\ninstructions were that as soon after the election of the new members as\r\nthe charter would permit the legislative Chambers of France should be\r\ncalled together and the proposition for an appropriation laid before\r\nthem; that all the constitutional powers of the King and his cabinet\r\nshould be exerted to accomplish the object, and that the result should\r\nbe made known early enough to be communicated to Congress at the\r\ncommencement of the present session. Relying upon these pledges, and\r\nnot doubting that the acknowledged justice of our claims, the promised\r\nexertions of the King and his cabinet, and, above all, that sacred\r\nregard for the national faith and honor for which the French character\r\nhas been so distinguished would secure an early execution of the treaty\r\nin all its parts, I did not deem it necessary to call the attention of\r\nCongress to the subject at the last session.\r\n\r\nI regret to say that the pledges made through the minister of France\r\nhave not been redeemed. The new Chambers met on July 31st, 1834, and\r\nalthough the subject of fulfilling treaties was alluded to in the\r\nspeech from the throne, no attempt was made by the King or his cabinet\r\nto procure an appropriation to carry it into execution. The reasons\r\ngiven for this omission, although they might be considered sufficient\r\nin an ordinary case, are not consistent with the expectations founded\r\nupon the assurances given here, for there is no constitutional obstacle\r\nto entering into legislative business at the first meeting of the\r\nChambers. This point, however, might have been over-looked had not the\r\nChambers, instead of being called to meet at so early a day that the\r\nresult of their deliberations might be communicated to me before the\r\nmeeting of Congress, been prorogued to December 29th, 1834--a period so\r\nlate that their decision can scarcely be made known to the present\r\nCongress prior to its dissolution. To avoid this delay our minister in\r\nParis, in virtue of the assurance given by the French minister in the\r\nUnited States, strongly urged the convocation of the Chambers at an\r\nearlier day, but without success. It is proper to remark, however, that\r\nthis refusal has been accompanied with the most positive assurances on\r\nthe part of the executive government of France of their intention to\r\npress the appropriation at the ensuing session of the Chambers.\r\n\r\nThe executive branch of this Government has, as matters stand,\r\nexhausted all the authority upon the subject with which it is invested\r\nand which it had any reason to believe could be beneficially employed.\r\n\r\nThe idea of acquiescing in the refusal to execute the treaty will not,\r\nI am confident, be for a moment entertained by any branch of this\r\nGovernment, and further negotiation upon the subject is equally out of\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\nIf it shall be the pleasure of Congress to await the further action of\r\nthe French Chambers, no further consideration of the subject will at\r\nthis session probably be required at your hands. But if from the\r\noriginal delay in asking for an appropriation, from the refusal of the\r\nChambers to grant it when asked, from the omission to bring the subject\r\nbefore the Chambers at their last session, from the fact that,\r\nincluding that session, there have been five different occasions when\r\nthe appropriation might have been made, and from the delay in convoking\r\nthe Chambers until some weeks after the meeting of Congress, when it\r\nwas well known that a communication of the whole subject to Congress at\r\nthe last session was prevented by assurances that it should be disposed\r\nof before its present meeting, you should feel yourselves constrained\r\nto doubt whether it be the intention of the French Government, in all\r\nits branches, to carry the treaty into effect, and think that such\r\nmeasures as the occasion may be deemed to call for should be now\r\nadopted, the important question arises what those measures shall be.\r\n\r\nOur institutions are essentially pacific. Peace and friendly\r\nintercourse with all nations are as much the desire of our Government\r\nas they are the interest of our people. But these objects are not to be\r\npermanently secured by surrendering the rights of our citizens or\r\npermitting solemn treaties for their indemnity, in cases of flagrant\r\nwrong, to be abrogated or set aside.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly in the power of Congress seriously to affect the\r\nagricultural and manufacturing interests of France by the passage of\r\nlaws relating to her trade with the United States. Her products,\r\nmanufactures, and tonnage may be subjected to heavy duties in our\r\nports, or all commercial intercourse with her may be suspended. But\r\nthere are powerful and to my mind conclusive objections to this mode of\r\nproceeding.\r\n\r\nWe can not embarrass or cut off the trade of France without at the same\r\ntime in some degree embarrassing or cutting off our own trade. The\r\ninjury of such a warfare must fall, though unequally, upon our own\r\ncitizens, and could not but impair the means of the Government and\r\nweaken that united sentiment in support of the rights and honor of the\r\nnation which must now pervade every bosom. Nor is it impossible that\r\nsuch a course of legislation would introduce once more into our\r\nnational councils those disturbing questions in relation to the tariff\r\nof duties which have been so recently put to rest. Besides, by every\r\nmeasure adopted by the Government of the United States with the view of\r\ninjuring France the clear perception of right which will induce our own\r\npeople and the rulers and people of all other nations, even of France\r\nherself, to pronounce our quarrel just will be obscured and the support\r\nrendered to us in a final resort to more decisive measures will be more\r\nlimited and equivocal.\r\n\r\nThere is but one point of controversy, and upon that the whole\r\ncivilized world must pronounce France to be in the wrong. We insist\r\nthat she shall pay us a sum of money which she has acknowledged to be\r\ndue, and of the justice of this demand there can be but one opinion\r\namong mankind. True policy would seem to dictate that the question at\r\nissue should be kept thus disencumbered and that not the slightest\r\npretense should be given to France to persist in her refusal to make\r\npayment by any act on our part affecting the interests of her people.\r\nThe question should be left, as it is now, in such an attitude that\r\nwhen France fulfills her treaty stipulations all controversy will be at\r\nan end.\r\n\r\nIt is my conviction that the United States ought to insist on a prompt\r\nexecution of the treaty, and in case it be refused or longer delayed\r\ntake redress into their own hands. After the delay on the part of\r\nFrance of a quarter of a century in acknowledging these claims by\r\ntreaty, it is not to be tolerated that another quarter of a century is\r\nto be wasted in negotiating about the payment. The laws of nations\r\nprovide a remedy for such occasions. It is a well-settled principle of\r\nthe international code that where one nation owes another a liquidated\r\ndebt which it refuses or neglects to pay the aggrieved party may seize\r\non the property belonging to the other, its citizens or subjects,\r\nsufficient to pay the debt without giving just cause of war. This\r\nremedy has been repeatedly resorted to, and recently by France herself\r\ntoward Portugal, under circumstances less unquestionable.\r\n\r\nThe time at which resort should be had to this or any other mode of\r\nredress is a point to be decided by Congress. If an appropriation shall\r\nnot be made by the French Chambers at their next session, it may justly\r\nbe concluded that the Government of France has finally determined to\r\ndisregard its own solemn undertaking and refuse to pay an acknowledged\r\ndebt. In that event every day's delay on our part will be a stain upon\r\nour national honor, as well as a denial of justice to our injured\r\ncitizens. Prompt measures, when the refusal of France shall be\r\ncomplete, will not only be most honorable and just, but will have the\r\nbest effect upon our national character.\r\n\r\nSince France, in violation of the pledges given through her minister\r\nhere, has delayed her final action so long that her decision will not\r\nprobably be known in time to be communicated to this Congress, I\r\nrecommend that a law be passed authorizing reprisals upon French\r\nproperty in case provision shall not be made for the payment of the\r\ndebt at the approaching session of the French Chambers. Her pride and\r\npower are too well known to expect any thing from her fears and\r\npreclude the necessity of a declaration that nothing partaking of the\r\ncharacter of intimidation is intended by us. She ought to look upon it\r\nas the evidence only of an inflexible determination on the part of the\r\nUnited States to insist on their rights.\r\n\r\nThat Government, by doing only what it has itself acknowledged to be\r\njust, will be able to spare the United States the necessity of taking\r\nredress into their own hands and save the property of French citizens\r\nfrom that seizure and sequestration which American citizens so long\r\nendured without retaliation or redress. If she should continue to\r\nrefuse that act of acknowledged justice and, in violation of the law of\r\nnations, make reprisals on our part the occasion of hostilities against\r\nthe United States, she would but add violence to injustice, and could\r\nnot fail to expose herself to the just censure of civilized nations and\r\nto the retributive judgments of Heaven.\r\n\r\nCollision with France is the more to be regretted on account of the\r\nposition she occupies in Europe in relation to liberal institutions,\r\nbut in maintaining our national rights and honor all governments are\r\nalike to us. If by a collision with France in a case where she is\r\nclearly in the wrong the march of liberal principles shall be impeded,\r\nthe responsibility for that result as well as every other will rest on\r\nher own head.\r\n\r\nHaving submitted these considerations, it belongs to Congress to decide\r\nwhether after what has taken place it will still await the further\r\naction of the French Chambers or now adopt such provisional measures as\r\nit may deem necessary and best adapted to protect the rights and\r\nmaintain the honor of the country. What ever that decision may be, it\r\nwill be faithfully enforced by the Executive as far as he is authorized\r\nso to do.\r\n\r\nAccording to the estimate of the Treasury Department, the revenue\r\naccruing from all sources during the present year will amount to\r\n$20,624,717, which, with the balance remaining in the Treasury on\r\nJanuary 1st, 1834 of $11,702,905, produces an aggregate of $32,327,623.\r\nThe total expenditure during the year for all objects, including the\r\npublic debt, is estimated at $25,591,390, which will leave a balance in\r\nthe Treasury on January 1st, 1835 of $6,736,232. In this balance,\r\nhowever, will be included about $1,150,000 of what was heretofore\r\nreported by the Department as not effective.\r\n\r\nOf former appropriations it is estimated that there will remain\r\nunexpended at the close of the year $8,002,925, and that of this sum\r\nthere will not be required more than $5,141,964 to accomplish the\r\nobjects of all the current appropriations. Thus it appears that after\r\nsatisfying all those appropriations and after discharging the last item\r\nof our public debt, which will be done on January 1st, 1835, there will\r\nremain unexpended in the Treasury an effective balance of about\r\n$440,000. That such should be the aspect of our finances is highly\r\nflattering to the industry and enterprise of our population and\r\nauspicious of the wealth and prosperity which await the future\r\ncultivation of their growing resources. It is not deemed prudent,\r\nhowever, to recommend any change for the present in our impost rates,\r\nthe effect of the gradual reduction now in progress in many of them not\r\nbeing sufficiently tested to guide us in determining the precise amount\r\nof revenue which they will produce.\r\n\r\nFree from public debt, at peace with all the world, and with no\r\ncomplicated interests to consult in our intercourse with foreign\r\npowers, the present may be hailed as the epoch in our history the most\r\nfavorable for the settlement of those principles in our domestic policy\r\nwhich shall be best calculated to give stability to our Republic and\r\nsecure the blessings of freedom to our citizens.\r\n\r\nAmong these principles, from our past experience, it can not be doubted\r\nthat simplicity in the character of the Federal Government and a rigid\r\neconomy in its administration should be regarded as fundamental and\r\nsacred. All must be sensible that the existence of the public debt, by\r\nrendering taxation necessary for its extinguishment, has increased the\r\ndifficulties which are inseparable from every exercise of the taxing\r\npower, and that it was in this respect a remote agent in producing\r\nthose disturbing questions which grew out of the discussions relating\r\nto the tariff. If such has been the tendency of a debt incurred in the\r\nacquisition and maintenance of our national rights and liberties, the\r\nobligations of which all portions of the Union cheerfully acknowledged,\r\nit must be obvious that what ever is calculated to increase the burdens\r\nof Government without necessity must be fatal to all our hopes of\r\npreserving its true character.\r\n\r\nWhile we are felicitating ourselves, therefore, upon the extinguishment\r\nof the national debt and the prosperous state of our finances, let us\r\nnot be tempted to depart from those sound maxims of public policy which\r\nenjoin a just adaptation of the revenue to the expenditures that are\r\nconsistent with a rigid economy and an entire abstinence from all\r\ntopics of legislation that are not clearly within the constitutional\r\npowers of the Government and suggested by the wants of the country.\r\nProperly regarded under such a policy, every diminution of the public\r\nburdens arising from taxation gives to individual enterprise increased\r\npower and furnishes to all the members of our happy Confederacy new\r\nmotives for patriotic affection and support. But above all, its most\r\nimportant effect will be found in its influence upon the character of\r\nthe Government by confining its action to those objects which will be\r\nsure to secure to it the attachment and support of our fellow citizens.\r\n\r\nCircumstances make it my duty to call the attention of Congress to the\r\nBank of the United States. Created for the convenience of the\r\nGovernment, that institution has become the scourge of the people. Its\r\ninterference to postpone the payment of a portion of the national debt\r\nthat it might retain the public money appropriated for that purpose to\r\nstrengthen it in a political contest, the extraordinary extension and\r\ncontraction of its accommodations to the community, its corrupt and\r\npartisan loans, its exclusion of the public directors from a knowledge\r\nof its most important proceedings, the unlimited authority conferred on\r\nthe president to expend its funds in hiring writers and procuring the\r\nexecution of printing, and the use made of that authority, the\r\nretention of the pension money and books after the selection of new\r\nagents, the groundless claim to heavy damages in consequence of the\r\nprotest of the bill drawn on the French Government, have through\r\nvarious channels been laid before Congress.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the close of the last session the bank, through its\r\npresident, announced its ability and readiness to abandon the system of\r\nunparalleled curtailment and the interruption of domestic exchanges\r\nwhich it had practiced upon from August 1st, 1833 to June 30th, 1834,\r\nand to extend its accommodations to the community. The grounds assumed\r\nin this annunciation amounted to an acknowledgment that the\r\ncurtailment, in the extent to which it had been carried, was not\r\nnecessary to the safety of the bank, and had been persisted in merely\r\nto induce Congress to grant the prayer of the bank in its memorial\r\nrelative to the removal of the deposits and to give it a new charter.\r\nThey were substantially a confession that all the real distresses which\r\nindividuals and the country had endured for the preceding six or eight\r\nmonths had been needlessly produced by it, with the view of affecting\r\nthrough the sufferings of the people the legislative action of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nIt is subject of congratulation that Congress and the country had the\r\nvirtue and firmness to bear the infliction, that the energies of our\r\npeople soon found relief from this wanton tyranny in vast importations\r\nof the precious metals from almost every part of the world, and that at\r\nthe close of this tremendous effort to control our Government the bank\r\nfound itself powerless and no longer able to loan out its surplus\r\nmeans. The community had learned to manage its affairs without its\r\nassistance, and trade had already found new auxiliaries, so that on\r\nOctober 1st, 1834 the extraordinary spectacle was presented of a\r\nnational more than half of whose capital was either lying unproductive\r\nin its vaults or in the hands of foreign bankers.\r\n\r\nTo the needless distresses brought on the country during the last\r\nsession of Congress has since been added the open seizure of the\r\ndividends on the public stock to the amount of $170,041, under pretense\r\nof paying damages, cost, and interest upon the protested French bill.\r\nThis sum constituted a portion of the estimated revenues for the year\r\n1834, upon which the appropriations made by Congress were based. It\r\nwould as soon have been expected that our collectors would seize on the\r\ncustoms or the receivers of our land offices on the moneys arising from\r\nthe sale of public lands under pretenses of claims against the United\r\nStates as that the bank would have retained the dividends. Indeed, if\r\nthe principle be established that any one who chooses to set up a claim\r\nagainst the United States may without authority of law seize on the\r\npublic property or money wherever he can find it to pay such claim,\r\nthere will remain no assurance that our revenue will reach the Treasury\r\nor that it will be applied after the appropriation to the purposes\r\ndesignated in the law.\r\n\r\nThe pay masters of our Army and the pursers of our Navy may under like\r\npretenses apply to their own use moneys appropriated to set in motion\r\nthe public force, and in time of war leave the country without defense.\r\nThis measure resorted to by the bank is disorganizing and\r\nrevolutionary, and if generally resorted to by private citizens in like\r\ncases would fill the land with anarchy and violence.\r\n\r\nIt is a constitutional provision \"that no money shall be drawn from the\r\nTreasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law\". The\r\npalpable object of this provision is to prevent the expenditure of the\r\npublic money for any purpose what so ever which shall not have been 1st\r\napproved by the representatives of the people and the States in\r\nCongress assembled. It vests the power of declaring for what purposes\r\nthe public money shall be expended in the legislative department of the\r\nGovernment, to the exclusion of the executive and judicial, and it is\r\nnot within the constitutional authority of either of those departments\r\nto pay it away without law or to sanction its payment.\r\n\r\nAccording to this plain constitutional provision, the claim of the bank\r\ncan never be paid without an appropriation by act of Congress. But the\r\nbank has never asked for an appropriation. It attempts to defeat the\r\nprovision of the Constitution and obtain payment without an act of\r\nCongress. Instead of awaiting an appropriation passed by both Houses\r\nand approved by the President, it makes an appropriation for itself and\r\ninvites an appeal to the judiciary to sanction it. That the money had\r\nnot technically been paid into the Treasury does not affect the\r\nprinciple intended to be established by the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe Executive and the judiciary have as little right to appropriate and\r\nexpend the public money without authority of law before it is placed to\r\nthe credit of the Treasury as to take it from the Treasury. In the\r\nannual report of the Secretary of the Treasury, and in his\r\ncorrespondence with the president of the bank, and the opinions of the\r\nAttorney General accompanying it, you will find a further examination\r\nof the claims of the bank and the course it has pursued.\r\n\r\nIt seems due to the safety of the people funds remaining in that bank\r\nand to the honor of the American people that measures be taken to\r\nseparate the Government entirely from an institution so mischievous to\r\nthe public prosperity and so regardless of the Constitution and laws.\r\nBy transferring the public deposits, by appointing other pension agents\r\nas far as it had the power, by ordering the discontinuance of the\r\nreceipt of bank checks in the payment of the public dues after January\r\n1st, 1834, the Executive has exerted all its lawful authority to sever\r\nthe connection between the Government and this faithless corporation.\r\n\r\nThe high-handed career of this institution imposes upon the\r\nconstitutional functionaries of this Government duties of the gravest\r\nand most imperative character--duties which they can not avoid and from\r\nwhich I trust there will be no inclination on the part of any of them\r\nto shrink. My own sense of them is most clear, as is also my readiness\r\nto discharge those which may rightfully fall on me. To continue any\r\nbusiness relations with the Bank of the United States that may be\r\navoided without a violation of the national faith after that\r\ninstitution has set at open defiance the conceded right of the\r\nGovernment to examine its affairs, after it has done all in its power\r\nto deride the public authority in other respects and to bring it into\r\ndisrepute at home and abroad, after it has attempted to defeat the\r\nclearly expressed will of the people by turning against them the\r\nimmense power intrusted to its hands and by involving a country\r\notherwise peaceful, flourishing, and happy, in dissension,\r\nembarrassment, and distress, would make the nation itself a party to\r\nthe degradation so sedulously prepared for its public agents and do\r\nmuch to destroy the confidence of man-kind in popular governments and\r\nto bring into contempt their authority and efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn guarding against an evil of such magnitude consideration of\r\ntemporary convenience should be thrown out of the question, and we\r\nshould be influenced by such motives only as look to the honor and\r\npreservation of the republican system. Deeply and solemnly impressed\r\nwith the justice of these views, I feel it to be my duty to recommend\r\nto you that a law be passed authorizing the sale of the public stock;\r\nthat the provision of the charter requiring the receipt of notes of the\r\nbank in payment of public dues shall, in accordance with the power\r\nreserved to Congress in the 14th section of the charter, be suspended\r\nuntil the bank pays to the Treasury the dividends withheld, and that\r\nall laws connecting the Government or its officers with the bank,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, be repealed, and that the institution be left\r\nhereafter to its own resources and means.\r\n\r\nEvents have satisfied my mind, and I think the minds of the American\r\npeople, that the mischiefs and dangers which flow from a national bank\r\nfar over-balance all its advantages. The bold effort the present bank\r\nhas made to control the Government, the distresses it has wantonly\r\nproduced, the violence of which it has been the occasion in one of our\r\ncities famed for its observance of law and order, are but premonitions\r\nof the fate which awaits the American people should they be deluded\r\ninto a perpetuation of this institution or the establishment of another\r\nlike it. It is fervently hoped that thus admonished those who have\r\nheretofore favored the establishment of a substitute for the present\r\nbank will be induced to abandon it, as it is evidently better to incur\r\nany inconvenience that may be reasonably expected than to concentrate\r\nthe whole moneyed power of the Republic in any form what so ever or\r\nunder any restrictions.\r\n\r\nHappily it is already illustrated that the agency of such an\r\ninstitution is not necessary to the fiscal operations of the\r\nGovernment. The State banks are found fully adequate to the performance\r\nof all services which were required of the Bank of the United States,\r\nquite as promptly and with the same cheapness. They have maintained\r\nthemselves and discharged all these duties while the Bank of the United\r\nStates was still powerful and in the field as an open enemy, and it is\r\nnot possible to conceive that they will find greater difficulties in\r\ntheir operations when that enemy shall cease to exist.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is earnestly invited to the regulation of the\r\ndeposits in the State banks by law. Although the power now exercised by\r\nthe executive department in this behalf is only such as was uniformly\r\nexerted through every Administration from the origin of the Government\r\nup to the establishment of the present bank, yet it is one which is\r\nsusceptible of regulation by law, and therefore ought so to be\r\nregulated. The power of Congress to direct in what places the Treasurer\r\nshall keep the moneys in the Treasury and to impose restrictions upon\r\nthe Executive authority in relation to their custody and removal is\r\nunlimited, and its exercise will rather be courted than discouraged by\r\nthose public officers and agents on whom rests the responsibility for\r\ntheir safety. It is desirable that as little power as possible should\r\nbe left to the President or the Secretary of the Treasury over those\r\ninstitutions, which, being thus freed from Executive influence, and\r\nwithout a common head to direct their operations, would have neither\r\nthe temptation nor the ability to interfere in the political conflicts\r\nof the country. Not deriving their charters from the national\r\nauthorities, they would never have those inducements to meddle in\r\ngeneral elections which have led the Bank of the United States to\r\nagitate and convulse the country for upward of two years.\r\n\r\nThe progress of our gold coinage is creditable to the officers of the\r\nMint, and promises in a short period to furnish the country with a\r\nsound and portable currency, which will much diminish the inconvenience\r\nto travelers of the want of a general paper currency should the State\r\nbanks be incapable of furnishing it. Those institutions have already\r\nshown themselves competent to purchase and furnish domestic exchange\r\nfor the convenience of trade at reasonable rates, and not a doubt is\r\nentertained that in a short period all the wants of the country in bank\r\naccommodations and exchange will be supplied as promptly and as cheaply\r\nas they have heretofore been by the Bank of the United States. If the\r\nseveral States shall be induced gradually to reform their banking\r\nsystems and prohibit the issue of all small notes, we shall in a few\r\nyears have a currency as sound and as little liable to fluctuations as\r\nany other commercial country.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War, together with the accompanying\r\ndocuments from the several bureaux of that Department, will exhibit the\r\nsituation of the various objects committed to its administration.\r\n\r\nNo event has occurred since your last session rendering necessary any\r\nmovements of the Army, with the exception of the expedition of the\r\nregiment of dragoons into the territory of the wandering and predatory\r\ntribes inhabiting the western frontier and living adjacent to the\r\nMexican boundary. These tribes have been heretofore known to us\r\nprincipally by their attacks upon our own citizens and upon other\r\nIndians entitled to the protection of the United States. It became\r\nnecessary for the peace of the frontiers to check these habitual\r\ninroads, and I am happy to inform you that the object has been effected\r\nwithout the commission of any act of hostility. Colonel Dodge and the\r\ntroops under his command have acted with equal firmness and humanity,\r\nand an arrangement has been made with those Indians which it is hoped\r\nwill assure their permanent pacific relations with the United States\r\nand the other tribes of Indians upon that border. It is to be regretted\r\nthat the prevalence of sickness in that quarter has deprived the\r\ncountry of a number of valuable lives, and particularly that General\r\nLeavenworth, an officer well known, and esteemed for his gallant\r\nservices in the late war and for his subsequent good conduct, has\r\nfallen a victim to his zeal and exertions in the discharge of his duty.\r\n\r\nThe Army is in a high state of discipline. Its moral condition, so far\r\nas that is known here, is good, and the various branches of the public\r\nservice are carefully attended to. It is amply sufficient under its\r\npresent organization for providing the necessary garrisons for the\r\nseaboard and for the defense of the internal frontier, and also for\r\npreserving the elements of military knowledge and for keeping pace with\r\nthose improvements which modern experience is continually making. And\r\nthese objects appear to me to embrace all the legitimate purposes for\r\nwhich a permanent military force should be maintained in our country.\r\nThe lessons of history teach us its danger and the tendency which\r\nexists to an increase. This can be best met and averted by a just\r\ncaution on the part of the public itself, and of those who represent\r\nthem in Congress.\r\n\r\nFrom the duties which devolve on the Engineer Department and upon the\r\ntopographical engineers, a different organization seems to be demanded\r\nby the public interest, and I recommend the subject to your\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nNo important change has during this season taken place in the condition\r\nof the Indians. Arrangements are in progress for the removal of the\r\nCreeks, and will soon be for the removal of the Seminoles. I regret\r\nthat the Cherokees east of the Mississippi have not yet determined as a\r\ncommunity to remove. How long the personal causes which have heretofore\r\nretarded that ultimately inevitable measure will continue to operate I\r\nam unable to conjecture. It is certain, however, that delay will bring\r\nwith it accumulated evils which will render their condition more and\r\nmore unpleasant. The experience of every year adds to the conviction\r\nthat emigration, and that alone, can preserve from destruction the\r\nremnant of the tribes yet living amongst us. The facility with which\r\nthe necessaries of life are procured and the treaty stipulations\r\nproviding aid for the emigrant Indians in their agricultural pursuits\r\nand in the important concern of education, and their removal from those\r\ncauses which have heretofore depressed all and destroyed many of the\r\ntribes, can not fail to stimulate their exertions and to reward their\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThe two laws passed at the last session of Congress on the subject of\r\nIndian affairs have been carried into effect, and detailed instructions\r\nfor their administration have been given. It will be seen by the\r\nestimates for the present session that a great reduction will take\r\nplace in the expenditures of the Department in consequence of these\r\nlaws, and there is reason to believe that their operation will be\r\nsalutary and that the colonization of the Indians on the western\r\nfrontier, together with a judicious system of administration, will\r\nstill further reduce the expenses of this branch of the public service\r\nand at the same time promote its usefulness and efficiency.\r\n\r\nCircumstances have been recently developed showing the existence of\r\nextensive frauds under the various laws granting pensions and\r\ngratuities for Revolutionary services. It is impossible to estimate the\r\namount which may have been thus fraudulently obtained from the National\r\nTreasury. I am satisfied, however, it has been such as to justify a\r\nre-examination of the system and the adoption of the necessary checks\r\nin its administration. All will agree that the services and sufferings\r\nof the remnant of our Revolutionary band should be fully compensated;\r\nbut while this is done, every proper precaution should be taken to\r\nprevent the admission of fabricated and fraudulent claims.\r\n\r\nIn the present mode of proceeding the attestations and certificates of\r\nthe judicial officers of the various States from a considerable portion\r\nof the checks which are interposed against the commission of frauds.\r\nThese, however, have been and may be fabricated, and in such a way as\r\nto elude detection at the examining offices. And independently of this\r\npractical difficulty, it is ascertained that these documents are often\r\nloosely granted; some times even blank certificates have been issued;\r\nsome times prepared papers have been signed without inquiry, and in one\r\ninstance, at least, the seal of the court has been within reach of a\r\nperson most interested in its improper application. It is obvious that\r\nunder such circumstances no severity of administration can check the\r\nabuse of the law. And information has from time to time been\r\ncommunicated to the Pension Office questioning or denying the right of\r\npersons placed upon the pension list to the bounty of the country.\r\n\r\nSuch cautions are always attended to and examined, but a far more\r\ngeneral investigation is called for, and I therefore recommend, in\r\nconformity with the suggestion of the Secretary of War, that an actual\r\ninspection should be made in each State into the circumstances and\r\nclaims of every person now drawing a pension. The honest veteran has\r\nnothing to fear from such a scrutiny, while the fraudulent claimant\r\nwill be detected and the public Treasury relieved to an amount, I have\r\nreason to believe, far greater than has heretofore been suspected. The\r\ndetails of such a plan could be so regulated as to interpose the\r\nnecessary checks without any burdensome operation upon the pensioners.\r\nThe object should be two-fold: To look into the original justice of the\r\nclaims, so far as this can be done under a proper system of\r\nregulations, by an examination of the claimants themselves and by\r\ninquiring in the vicinity of their residence into their history and\r\ninto the opinion entertained of their Revolutionary services. To\r\nascertain in all cases whether the original claimant is living and this\r\nby actual personal inspection. This measure will, if adopted, be\r\nproductive, I think, of the desired results, and I therefore recommend\r\nit to your consideration, with the further suggestion that all payments\r\nshould be suspended 'til the necessary reports are received.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by a tabular statement annexed to the documents\r\ntransmitted to Congress that the appropriations for objects connected\r\nwith the War Department, made at the last session, for the service of\r\nthe year 1834, excluding the permanent appropriation for the payment of\r\nmilitary gratuities under the act of June 7th, 1832, the appropriation\r\nof $200,000 for arming and equipping the militia, and the appropriation\r\nof $10,000 for the civilization of the Indians, which are not annually\r\nrenewed, amounted to the sum of $9,003,261, and that the estimates of\r\nappropriations necessary for the same branches of service for the year\r\n1835 amount to the sum of $5,778,964, making a difference in the\r\nappropriations of the current year over the estimates of the\r\nappropriations for the next of $3,224,297.\r\n\r\nThe principal causes which have operated at this time to produce this\r\ngreat difference are shown in the reports and documents and in the\r\ndetailed estimates. Some of these causes are accidental and temporary,\r\nwhile others are permanent, and, aided by a just course of\r\nadministration, may continue to operate beneficially upon the public\r\nexpenditures.\r\n\r\nA just economy, expending where the public service requires and\r\nwithholding where it does not, is among the indispensable duties of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy and\r\nto the documents with it for a full view of the operations of that\r\nimportant branch of our service during the present year. It will be\r\nseen that the wisdom and liberality with which Congress has provided\r\nfor the gradual increase of our navy material have been seconded by a\r\ncorresponding zeal and fidelity on the part of those to whom has been\r\nconfided the execution of the laws on the subject, and that but a short\r\nperiod would be now required to put in commission a force large enough\r\nfor any exigency into which the country may be thrown.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect upon our position in relation to other nations, it must\r\nbe apparent that in the event of conflicts with them we must look\r\nchiefly to our Navy for the protection of our national rights. The wide\r\nseas which separate us from other Governments must of necessity be the\r\ntheater on which an enemy will aim to assail us, and unless we are\r\nprepared to meet him on this element we can not be said to possess the\r\npower requisite to repel or prevent aggressions. We can not, therefore,\r\nwatch with too much attention this arm of our defense, or cherish with\r\ntoo much care the means by which it can possess the necessary\r\nefficiency and extension. To this end our policy has been heretofore\r\nwisely directed to the constant employment of a force sufficient to\r\nguard our commerce, and to the rapid accumulation of the materials\r\nwhich are necessary to repair our vessels and construct with ease such\r\nnew ones as may be required in a state of war.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this policy, I recommend to your consideration the\r\nerection of the additional dry dock described by the Secretary of the\r\nNavy, and also the construction of the steam batteries to which he has\r\nreferred, for the purpose of testing their efficacy as auxiliaries to\r\nthe system of defense now in use.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Post Master General herewith submitted exhibits the\r\ncondition and prospects of that Department. From that document it\r\nappears that there was a deficit in the funds of the Department at the\r\ncommencement of the present year beyond its available means of\r\n$315,599.98, which on the first of July last had been reduced to\r\n$268,092.74. It appears also that the revenues for the coming year will\r\nexceed the expenditures about $270,000, which, with the excess of\r\nrevenue which will result from the operations of the current half year,\r\nmay be expected, independently of any increase in the gross amount of\r\npostages, to supply the entire deficit before the end of 1835. But as\r\nthis calculation is based on the gross amount of postages which had\r\naccrued within the period embraced by the times of striking the\r\nbalances, it is obvious that without a progressive increase in the\r\namount of postages the existing retrenchments must be persevered in\r\nthrough the year 1836 that the Department may accumulate a surplus fund\r\nsufficient to place it in a condition of perfect ease.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the revenues of the Post Office Department,\r\nthough they have increased, and their amount is above that of any\r\nformer year, have yet fallen short of the estimates more than $100,000.\r\nThis is attributed in a great degree to the increase of free letters\r\ngrowing out of the extension and abuse of the franking privilege. There\r\nhas been a gradual increase in the number of executive offices to which\r\nit has been granted, and by an act passed in March, 1833, it was\r\nextended to members of Congress throughout the whole year. It is\r\nbelieved that a revision of the laws relative to the franking\r\nprivilege, with some enactments to enforce more rigidly the\r\nrestrictions under which it is granted, would operate beneficially to\r\nthe country, by enabling the Department at an earlier period to restore\r\nthe mail facilities that have been withdrawn, and to extend them more\r\nwidely, as the growing settlements of the country may require.\r\n\r\nTo a measure so important to the Government and so just to our\r\nconstituents, who ask no exclusive privileges for themselves and are\r\nnot willing to concede them to others, I earnestly recommend the\r\nserious attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the Post Office Department and the magnitude to which\r\nit has grown, both in its revenues and in its operations, seem to\r\ndemand its reorganization by law. The whole of its receipts and\r\ndisbursements have hitherto been left entirely to Executive control and\r\nindividual discretion. The principle is as sound in relation to this as\r\nto any other Department of the Government, that as little discretion\r\nshould be confided to the executive officer who controls it as is\r\ncompatible with its efficiency. It is therefore earnestly recommended\r\nthat it be organized with an auditor and treasurer of its own,\r\nappointed by the President and Senate, who shall be branches of the\r\nTreasury Department.\r\n\r\nYour attention is again respectfully invited to the defect which exists\r\nin the judicial system of the United States. Nothing can be more\r\ndesirable than the uniform operation of the Federal judiciary\r\nthroughout the several States, all of which, standing on the same\r\nfooting as members of the Union, have equal rights to the advantages\r\nand benefits resulting from its laws. This object is not attained by\r\nthe judicial acts now in force, because they leave one quarter of the\r\nStates without circuit courts.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly the duty of Congress to place all the States on the\r\nsame footing in this respect, either by the creation of an additional\r\nnumber of associate judges or by an enlargement of the circuits\r\nassigned to those already appointed so as to include the new States.\r\nWhat ever may be the difficulty in a proper organization of the\r\njudicial system so as to secure its efficiency and uniformity in all\r\nparts of the Union and at the same time to avoid such an increase of\r\njudges as would encumber the supreme appellate tribunal, it should not\r\nbe allowed to weigh against the great injustice which the present\r\noperation of the system produces.\r\n\r\nI trust that I may be also pardoned for renewing the recommendation I\r\nhave so often submitted to your attention in regard to the mode of\r\nelecting the President and Vice President of the United States. All the\r\nreflection I have been able to bestow upon the subject increases my\r\nconviction that the best interests of the country will be promoted by\r\nthe adoption of some plan which will secure in all contingencies that\r\nimportant right of sovereignty to the direct control of the people.\r\nCould this be attained, and the terms of those officers be limited to a\r\nsingle period of either four or six years, I think our liberties would\r\npossess an additional safeguard.\r\n\r\nAt your last session I called the attention of Congress to the\r\ndestruction of the public building occupied by the Treasury Department.\r\nAs the public interest requires that another building should be erected\r\nwith as little delay as possible, it is hoped that the means will be\r\nseasonably provided and that they will be ample enough to authorize\r\nsuch an enlargement and improvement in the plan of the building as will\r\nmore effectually accommodate the public officers and secure the public\r\ndocuments deposited in it from the casualties of fire.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to satisfy myself that the bill entitled \"An act\r\nto improve the navigation of the Wabash River\", which was sent to me at\r\nthe close of your last session, ought to pass, and I have therefore\r\nwithheld from it my approval and now return it to the Senate, the body\r\nin which it originated.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question connected with the administration of public\r\naffairs more important or more difficult to be satisfactorily dealt\r\nwith than that which relates to the rightful authority and proper\r\naction of the Federal Government upon the subject of internal\r\nimprovements. To inherent embarrassments have been added others\r\nresulting from the course of our legislation concerning it.\r\n\r\nI have heretofore communicated freely with Congress upon this subject,\r\nand in adverting to it again I can not refrain from expressing my\r\nincreased conviction of its extreme importance as well in regard to its\r\nbearing upon the maintenance of the Constitution and the prudent\r\nmanagement of the public revenue as on account of its disturbing effect\r\nupon the harmony of the Union.\r\n\r\nWe are in no danger from violations of the Constitution by which\r\nencroachments are made upon the personal rights of the citizen. The\r\nsentence of condemnation long since pronounced by the American people\r\nupon acts of that character will, I doubt not, continue to prove as\r\nsalutary in its effects as it is irreversible in its nature.\r\n\r\nBut against the dangers of unconstitutional acts which, instead of\r\nmenacing the vengeance of offended authority, proffer local advantages\r\nand bring in their train the patronage of the Government, we are, I\r\nfear, not so safe. To suppose that because our Government has been\r\ninstituted for the benefit of the people it must therefore have the\r\npower to do what ever may seem to conduce to the public good is an\r\nerror into which even honest minds are too apt to fall. In yielding\r\nthemselves to this fallacy they overlook the great considerations in\r\nwhich the Federal Constitution was founded. They forget that in\r\nconsequence of the conceded diversities in the interest and condition\r\nof the different States it was foreseen at the period of its adoption\r\nthat although a particular measure of the Government might be\r\nbeneficial and proper in one State it might be the reverse in another;\r\nthat it was for this reason the States would not consent to make a\r\ngrant to the Federal Government of the general and usual powers of\r\ngovernment, but of such only as were specifically enumerated, and the\r\nprobable effects of which they could, as they thought, safely\r\nanticipate; and they forget also the paramount obligation upon all to\r\nabide by the compact then so solemnly and, as it was hoped, so firmly\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the dangers to the Constitution springing from the\r\nsources I have stated, there has been one which was perhaps greater\r\nthan all. I allude to the materials which this subject has afforded for\r\nsinister appeals to selfish feelings, and the opinion heretofore so\r\nextensively entertained of its adaptation to the purposes of personal\r\nambition. With such stimulus it is not surprising that the acts and\r\npretensions of the Federal Government in this behalf should some times\r\nhave been carried to an alarming extent. The questions which have\r\narisen upon this subject have related--To the power of making internal\r\nimprovements within the limits of a State, with the right of\r\nterritorial jurisdiction, sufficient at least for their preservation\r\nand use. To the right of appropriating money in aid of such works when\r\ncarried on by a State of by a company in virtue of State authority,\r\nsurrendering the claim of jurisdiction; and To the propriety of\r\nappropriation for improvements of a particular class, viz, for light\r\nhouses, beacons, buoys, public piers, and for the removal of sand bars,\r\nsawyers, and other temporary and partial impediments in our navigable\r\nrivers and harbors. The claims of power for the General Government upon\r\neach of these points certainly present matter of the deepest interest.\r\nThe first is, however, of much the greatest importance, in as much as,\r\nin addition to the dangers of unequal and improvident expenditures of\r\npublic moneys common to all, there is super-added to that the\r\nconflicting jurisdictions of the respective governments. Federal\r\njurisdiction, at least to the extent I have stated, has been justly\r\nregarded by its advocates as necessarily appurtenant to the power in\r\nquestion, if that exists by the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThat the most injurious conflicts would unavoidably arise between the\r\nrespective jurisdictions of the State and Federal Governments in the\r\nabsence of a constitutional provision marking out their respective\r\nboundaries can not be doubted. The local advantages to be obtained\r\nwould induce the States to overlook in the beginning the dangers and\r\ndifficulties to which they might ultimately be exposed. The powers\r\nexercised by the Federal Government would soon be regarded with\r\njealousy by the State authorities, and originating as they must from\r\nimplication or assumption, it would be impossible to affix to them\r\ncertain and safe limits.\r\n\r\nOpportunities and temptations to the assumption of power incompatible\r\nwith State sovereignty would be increased and those barriers which\r\nresist the tendency of our system toward consolidation greatly\r\nweakened. The officers and agents of the General Government might not\r\nalways have the discretion to abstain from intermeddling with State\r\nconcerns, and if they did they would not always escape the suspicion of\r\nhaving done so. Collisions and consequent irritations would spring up;\r\nthat harmony which should ever exist between the General Government and\r\neach member of the Confederacy would be frequently interrupted; a\r\nspirit of contention would be engendered and the dangers of disunion\r\ngreatly multiplied.\r\n\r\nYet we know that not withstanding these grave objections this dangerous\r\ndoctrine was at one time apparently proceeding to its final\r\nestablishment with fearful rapidity. The desire to embark the Federal\r\nGovernment in works of internal improvement prevailed in the highest\r\ndegree during the first session of the first Congress that I had the\r\nhonor to meet in my present situation. When the bill authorizing a\r\nsubscription on the part of the United States for stock in the\r\nMaysville and Lexington Turn Pike Company passed the two houses, there\r\nhad been reported by the Committees of Internal Improvements bills\r\ncontaining appropriations for such objects, inclusive of those for the\r\nCumberland road and for harbors and light houses, to the amount of\r\n$106,000,000. In this amount was included authority to the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury to subscribe for the stock of different companies to a\r\ngreat extent, and the residue was principally for the direct\r\nconstruction of roads by this Government. In addition to these\r\nprojects, which had been presented to the two Houses under the sanction\r\nand recommendation of their respective Committees on Internal\r\nImprovements, there were then still pending before the committees, and\r\nin memorials to Congress presented but not referred, different projects\r\nfor works of a similar character, the expense of which can not be\r\nestimated with certainty, but must have exceeded $100,000,000.\r\n\r\nRegarding the bill authorizing a subscription to the stock of the\r\nMaysville and Lexington Turn Pike Company as the entering wedge of a\r\nsystem which, however weak at first, might soon become strong enough to\r\nrive the bands of the Union asunder, and believing that if its passage\r\nwas acquiesced in by the Executive and the people there would no longer\r\nbe any limitation upon the authority of the General Government in\r\nrespect to the appropriation of money for such objects, I deemed it an\r\nimperative duty to withhold from it the Executive approval.\r\n\r\nAlthough from the obviously local character of that work I might well\r\nhave contented myself with a refusal to approve the bill upon that\r\nground, yet sensible of the vital importance of the subject, and\r\nanxious that my views and opinions in regard to the whole matter should\r\nbe fully understood by Congress and by my constituents, I felt it my\r\nduty to go further. I therefore embraced that early occasion to apprise\r\nCongress that in my opinion the Constitution did not confer upon it the\r\npower to authorize the construction of ordinary roads and canals within\r\nthe limits of a State and to say, respectfully, that no bill admitting\r\nsuch a power could receive my official sanction. I did so in the\r\nconfident expectation that the speedy settlement of the public mind\r\nupon the whole subject would be greatly facilitated by the difference\r\nbetween the two Houses and myself, and that the harmonious action of\r\nthe several departments of the Federal Government in regard to it would\r\nbe ultimately secured.\r\n\r\nSo far, at least, as it regards this branch of the subject, my best\r\nhopes have been realized. Nearly four years have elapsed, and several\r\nsessions of Congress have intervened, and no attempt within my\r\nrecollection has been made to induce Congress to exercise this power.\r\nThe applications for the construction of roads and canals which were\r\nformerly multiplied upon your files are no longer presented, and we\r\nhave good reason to infer that the current public sentiment has become\r\nso decided against the pretension as effectually to discourage its\r\nreassertion. So thinking, I derive the greatest satisfaction from the\r\nconviction that thus much at least has been secured upon this important\r\nand embarrassing subject.\r\n\r\nFrom attempts to appropriate the national funds to objects which are\r\nconfessedly of a local character we can not, I trust, have anything\r\nfurther to apprehend. My views in regard to the expediency of making\r\nappropriations for works which are claimed to be of a national\r\ncharacter and prosecuted under State authority--assuming that Congress\r\nhave the right to do so--were stated in my annual message to Congress\r\nin 1830, and also in that containing my objections to the Maysville\r\nroad bill.\r\n\r\nSo thoroughly convinced am I that no such appropriations ought to be\r\nmade by Congress until a suitable constitutional provision is made upon\r\nthe subject, and so essential do I regard the point to the highest\r\ninterests of our country, that I could not consider myself as\r\ndischarging my duty to my constituents in giving the Executive sanction\r\nto any bill containing such an appropriation. If the people of the\r\nUnited States desire that the public Treasury shall be resorted to for\r\nthe means to prosecute such works, they will concur in an amendment of\r\nthe Constitution prescribing a rule by which the national character of\r\nthe works is to be tested, and by which the greatest practicable\r\nequality of benefits may be secured to each member of the Confederacy.\r\nThe effects of such a regulation would be most salutary in preventing\r\nunprofitable expenditures, in securing our legislation from the\r\npernicious consequences of a scramble for the favors of Government, and\r\nin repressing the spirit of discontent which must inevitably arise from\r\nan unequal distribution of treasures which belong alike to all.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of appropriations for what may be called,\r\nwithout impropriety, internal improvements, which have always been\r\nregarded as standing upon different grounds from those to which I have\r\nreferred. I allude to such as have for their object the improvement of\r\nour harbors, the removal of partial and temporary obstructions in our\r\nnavigable rivers, for the facility and security of our foreign\r\ncommerce. The grounds upon which I distinguished appropriations of this\r\ncharacter from others have already been stated to Congress. I will now\r\nonly add that at the 1st session of Congress under the new Constitution\r\nit was provided by law that all expenses which should accrue from and\r\nafter the 15th day of August, 1789, in the necessary support and\r\nmaintenance and repairs of all light houses, beacons, buoys, and public\r\npiers erected, placed, or sunk before the passage of the act within any\r\nbay, inlet, harbor, or port of the United States, for rendering the\r\nnavigation thereof easy and safe, should be defrayed out of the\r\nTreasury of the United States, and, further, that it should be the duty\r\nof the Secretary of the Treasury to provide by contracts, with the\r\napprobation of the President, for rebuilding when necessary and keeping\r\nin good repair the light houses, beacons, buoys, and public piers in\r\nthe several States, and for furnishing them with supplies.\r\n\r\nAppropriations for similar objects have been continued from that time\r\nto the present without interruption or dispute. As a natural\r\nconsequence of the increase and extension of our foreign commerce,\r\nports of entry and delivery have been multiplied and established, not\r\nonly upon our sea-board but in the interior of the country upon our\r\nlakes and navigable rivers. The convenience and safety of this commerce\r\nhave led to the gradual extension of these expenditures; to the\r\nerection of light houses, the placing, planting, and sinking of buoys,\r\nbeacons, and piers, and to the removal of partial and temporary\r\nobstructions in our navigable rivers and in the harbors upon our Great\r\nLakes as well as on the sea-board.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have expressed to Congress my apprehension that these\r\nexpenditures have some times been extravagant and disproportionate to\r\nthe advantages to be derived from them, I have not felt it to be my\r\nduty to refuse my assent to bills containing them, and have contented\r\nmyself to follow in this respect in the foot-steps of all my\r\npredecessors. Sensible, however, from experience and observation of the\r\ngreat abuses to which the unrestricted exercise of this authority by\r\nCongress was exposed, I have prescribed a limitation for the government\r\nof my own conduct by which expenditures of this character are confined\r\nto places below the ports of entry or delivery established by law. I am\r\nvery sensible that this restriction is not as satisfactory as could be\r\ndesired, and that much embarrassment may be caused to the executive\r\ndepartment in its execution by appropriations for remote and not\r\nwell-understood objects. But as neither my own reflections nor the\r\nlights which I may properly derive from other sources have supplied me\r\nwith a better, I shall continue to apply my best exertions to a\r\nfaithful application of the rule upon which it is founded.\r\n\r\nI sincerely regret that I could not give my assent to the bill\r\nentitled: \"An act to improve the navigation of the Wabash River\"; but I\r\ncould not have done so without receding from the ground which I have,\r\nupon the fullest consideration, taken upon this subject, and of which\r\nCongress has been heretofore apprised, and without throwing the subject\r\nagain open to abuses which no good citizen entertaining my opinions\r\ncould desire.\r\n\r\nI rely upon the intelligence and candor of my fellow citizens, in whose\r\nliberal indulgence I have already so largely participated, for a\r\ncorrect appreciation on my motives in interposing as I have done on\r\nthis and other occasions checks to a course of legislation which,\r\nwithout in the slightest degree calling in question the motives of\r\nothers, I consider as sanctioning improper and unconstitutional\r\nexpenditures of public treasure.\r\n\r\nI am not hostile to internal improvements, and wish to see them\r\nextended to every part of the country. But I am fully persuaded, if\r\nthey are not commenced in a proper manner, confined to proper objects,\r\nand conducted under an authority generally conceded to be rightful,\r\nthat a successful prosecution of them can not be reasonably expected.\r\nThe attempt will meet with resistance where it might otherwise receive\r\nsupport, and instead of strengthening the bonds of our Confederacy it\r\nwill only multiply and aggravate the causes of disunion.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nAndrew Jackson\r\nDecember 7, 1835\r\n\r\nFellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nIn the discharge of my official duty the again devolves upon me of\r\ncommunicating with a new Congress. The reflection that the\r\nrepresentation of the Union has been recently renewed, and that the\r\nconstitutional term of its service will expire with my own, heightens\r\nthe solicitude with which I shall attempt to lay before it the state of\r\nour national concerns and the devout hope which I cherish that its\r\nlabors to improve them may be crowned with success.\r\n\r\nYou are assembled at a period of profound interest to the American\r\npatriot. The unexampled growth and prosperity of our country having\r\ngiven us a rank in the scale of nations which removes all apprehension\r\nof danger to our integrity and independence from external foes, the\r\ncareer of freedom is before us, with an earnest from the past that if\r\ntrue to ourselves there can be no formidable obstacle in the future to\r\nits peaceful and uninterrupted pursuit. Yet, in proportion to the\r\ndisappearance of those apprehensions which attended our weakness, as\r\nonce contrasted with the power of some of the States of the Old World,\r\nshould we now be solicitous as to those which belong to the conviction\r\nthat it is to our own conduct we must look for the preservation of\r\nthose causes on which depend the excellence and the duration of our\r\nhappy system of government.\r\n\r\nIn the example of other systems founded on the will of the people we\r\ntrace to internal dissension the influences which have so often blasted\r\nthe hopes of the friends of freedom. The social elements, which were\r\nstrong and successful when united against external danger, failed in\r\nthe more difficult task of properly adjusting their own internal\r\norganization, and thus gave way the great principle of self-government.\r\nLet us trust that this admonition will never be forgotten by the\r\nGovernment or the people of the United States, and that the testimony\r\nwhich our experience thus far holds out to the great human family of\r\nthe practicability and the blessings of free government will be\r\nconfirmed in all time to come.\r\n\r\nWe have but to look at the state of our agriculture, manufactures, and\r\ncommerce and the unexampled increase of our population to feel the\r\nmagnitude of the trust committed to us. Never in any former period of\r\nour history have we had greater reason than we now have to be thankful\r\nto Divine Providence for the blessings of health and general\r\nprosperity. Every branch of labor we see crowned with the most abundant\r\nrewards. In every element of national resources and wealth and of\r\nindividual comfort we witness the most rapid and solid improvements.\r\nWith no interruptions to this pleasing prospect at home which will not\r\nyield to the spirit of harmony and good will that so strikingly\r\npervades the mass of the people in every quarter, amidst all the\r\ndiversity of interest and pursuits to which they are attached, and with\r\nno cause of solicitude in regard to our external affairs which will\r\nnot, it is hoped, disappear before the principles of simple justice and\r\nthe forbearance that mark our intercourse with foreign powers, we have\r\nevery reason to feel proud of our beloved country.\r\n\r\nThe general state of our foreign relations has not materially changed\r\nsince my last annual message.\r\n\r\nIn the settlement of the question of the North Eastern boundary little\r\nprogress has been made. Great Britain has declined acceding to the\r\nproposition of the United States, presented in accordance with the\r\nresolution of the Senate, unless certain preliminary conditions were\r\nadmitted, which I deemed incompatible with a satisfactory and rightful\r\nadjustment of the controversy. Waiting for some distinct proposal from\r\nthe Government of Great Britain, which has been invited, I can only\r\nrepeat the expression of my confidence that, with the strong mutual\r\ndisposition which I believe exists to make a just arrangement, this\r\nperplexing question can be settled with a due regard to the\r\nwell-founded pretensions and pacific policy of all the parties to it.\r\nEvents are frequently occurring on the North Eastern frontier of a\r\ncharacter to impress upon all the necessity of a speedy and definitive\r\ntermination of the dispute. This consideration, added to the desire\r\ncommon to both to relieve the liberal and friendly relations so happily\r\nexisting between the two countries from all embarrassment, will no\r\ndoubt have its just influence upon both.\r\n\r\nOur diplomatic intercourse with Portugal has been renewed, and it is\r\nexpected that the claims of our citizens, partially paid, will be fully\r\nsatisfied as soon as the condition of the Queen's Government will\r\npermit the proper attention to the subject of them. That Government\r\nhas, I am happy to inform you, manifested a determination to act upon\r\nthe liberal principles which have marked our commercial policy. The\r\nhappiest effects upon the future trade between the United States and\r\nPortugal are anticipated from it, and the time is not thought to be\r\nremote when a system of perfect reciprocity will be established.\r\n\r\nThe installments due under the convention with the King of the Two\r\nSicilies have been paid with that scrupulous fidelity by which his\r\nwhole conduct has been characterized, and the hope is indulged that the\r\nadjustment of the vexed question of our claims will be followed by a\r\nmore extended and mutually beneficial intercourse between the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe internal contest still continues in Spain. Distinguished as this\r\nstruggle has unhappily been by incidents of the most sanguinary\r\ncharacter, the obligations of the late treaty of indemnification with\r\nus have been, never the less, faithfully executed by the Spanish\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nNo provision having been made at the last session of Congress for the\r\nascertainment of the claims to be paid and the apportionment of the\r\nfunds under the convention made with Spain, I invite your early\r\nattention to the subject. The public evidences of the debt have,\r\naccording to the terms of the convention and in the forms prescribed by\r\nit, been placed in the possession of the United States, and the\r\ninterest as it fell due has been regularly paid upon them. Our\r\ncommercial intercourse with Cuba stands as regulated by the act of\r\nCongress. No recent information has been received as to the disposition\r\nof the Government of Madrid, and the lamented death of our recently\r\nappointed minister on his way to Spain, with the pressure of their\r\naffairs at home, renders it scarcely probable that any change is to be\r\nlooked for during the coming year.\r\n\r\nFurther portions of the Florida archives have been sent to the United\r\nStates, although the death of one of the commissioners at a critical\r\nmoment embarrassed the progress of the delivery of them. The higher\r\nofficers of the local government have recently shown an anxious desire,\r\nin compliance with the orders from the parent Government, to facilitate\r\nthe selection and delivery of all we have a right to claim.\r\n\r\nNegotiations have been opened at Madrid for the establishment of a\r\nlasting peace between Spain and such of the Spanish American\r\nGovernments of this hemisphere as have availed themselves of the\r\nintimation given to all of them of the disposition of Spain to treat\r\nupon the basis of their entire independence. It is to be regretted that\r\nsimultaneous appointments by all of ministers to negotiate with Spain\r\nhad not been made. The negotiation itself would have been simplified,\r\nand this long-standing dispute, spreading over a large portion of the\r\nworld, would have been brought to a more speedy conclusion.\r\n\r\nOur political and commercial relations with Austria, Prussia, Sweden,\r\nand Denmark stand on the usual favorable bases. One of the articles of\r\nour treaty with Russia in relation to the trade on the North-West coast\r\nof America having expired, instructions have been given to our minister\r\nat St. Petersburg to negotiate a renewal of it. The long and unbroken\r\namity between the two Governments gives every reason for supposing the\r\narticle will be renewed, if stronger motives do not exist to prevent it\r\nthan with our view of the subject can be anticipated here. I ask your\r\nattention to the message of my predecessor at the opening of the second\r\nsession of the 19th Congress, relative to our commercial intercourse\r\nwith Holland, and to the documents connected with that subject,\r\ncommunicated to the House of Representatives on the 10th of January,\r\n1825, and 18th of January, 1827.\r\n\r\nCoinciding in the opinion of my predecessor that Holland is not, under\r\nthe regulations of her present system, entitled to have her vessels and\r\ntheir cargoes received into the United States on the footing of\r\nAmerican vessels and cargoes as regards duties of tonnage and impost, a\r\nrespect for his reference of it to the Legislature has alone prevented\r\nme from acting on the subject. I should still have waited without\r\ncomment for the action of Congress, but recently a claim has been made\r\nby Belgian subjects to admission into our ports for their ships and\r\ncargoes on the same footing as American, with the allegation we could\r\nnot dispute that our vessels received in their ports the identical\r\ntreatment shewn to them in the ports of Holland, upon whose vessels no\r\ndiscrimination is made in the ports of the United States.\r\n\r\nGiven the same privileges the Belgians expected the same benefits--\r\nbenefits that were, in fact, enjoyed when Belgium and Holland were\r\nunited under one Government. Satisfied with the justice of their\r\npretension to be placed on the same footing with Holland, I could not,\r\nnever the less, without disregard to the principle of our laws, admit\r\ntheir claim to be treated as Americans, and at the same time a respect\r\nfor Congress, to whom the subject had long since been referred, has\r\nprevented me from producing a just equality by taking from the vessels\r\nof Holland privileges conditionally granted by acts of Congress,\r\nalthough the condition upon which the grant was made has, in my\r\njudgment, failed since 1822. I recommend, therefore, a review of the\r\nact of 1824, and such modification of it as will produce an equality on\r\nsuch terms as Congress shall think best comports with our settled\r\npolicy and the obligations of justice to two friendly powers.\r\n\r\nWith the Sublime Porte and all the Governments on the coast of Barbary\r\nour relations continue to be friendly. The proper steps have been taken\r\nto renew our treaty with Morocco.\r\n\r\nThe Argentine Republic has again promised to send within the current\r\nyear a minister to the United States.\r\n\r\nA convention with Mexico for extending the time for the appointment of\r\ncommissioners to run the boundary line has been concluded and will be\r\nsubmitted to the Senate. Recent events in that country have awakened\r\nthe liveliest solicitude in the United States. Aware of the strong\r\ntemptations existing and powerful inducements held out to the citizens\r\nof the United States to mingle in the dissensions of our immediate\r\nneighbors, instructions have been given to the district attorneys of\r\nthe United States where indications warranted it to prosecute without\r\nrespect to persons all who might attempt to violate the obligations of\r\nour neutrality, while at the same time it has been thought necessary to\r\napprise the Government of Mexico that we should require the integrity\r\nof our territory to be scrupulously respected by both parties.\r\n\r\nFrom our diplomatic agents in Brazil, Chile, Peru, Central America,\r\nVenezuela, and New Granada constant assurances are received of the\r\ncontinued good understanding with the Governments to which they are\r\nseverally accredited. With those Governments upon which our citizens\r\nhave valid and accumulating claims, scarcely an advance toward a\r\nsettlement of them is made, owing mainly to their distracted state or\r\nto the pressure of imperative domestic questions. Our patience has been\r\nand will probably be still further severely tried, but our fellow\r\ncitizens whose interests are involved may confide in the determination\r\nof the Government to obtain for them eventually ample retribution.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, many of the nations of this hemisphere are still\r\nself-tormented by domestic dissensions. Revolution succeeds revolution;\r\ninjuries are committed upon foreigners engaged in lawful pursuits; much\r\ntime elapses before a government sufficiently stable is erected to\r\njustify expectation of redress; ministers are sent and received, and\r\nbefore the discussions of past injuries are fairly begun fresh troubles\r\narise; but too frequently new injuries are added to the old, to be\r\ndiscussed together with the existing government after it has proved its\r\nability to sustain the assaults made upon it, or with its successor if\r\noverthrown. If this unhappy condition of things continues much longer,\r\nother nations will be under the painful necessity of deciding whether\r\njustice to their suffering citizens does not require a prompt redress\r\nof injuries by their own power, without waiting for the establishment\r\nof a government competent and enduring enough to discuss and to make\r\nsatisfaction for them.\r\n\r\nSince the last session of Congress the validity of our claims upon\r\nFrance, as liquidated by the treaty of 1831, has been acknowledged by\r\nboth branches of her legislature, and the money has been appropriated\r\nfor their discharge; but the payment is, I regret to inform you, still\r\nwithheld.\r\n\r\nA brief recapitulation of the most important incidents in this\r\nprotracted controversy will shew how utterly untenable are the grounds\r\nupon which this course is attempted to be justified.\r\n\r\nOn entering upon the duties of my station I found the United States an\r\nunsuccessful applicant to the justice of France for the satisfaction of\r\nclaims the validity of which was never questionable, and has now been\r\nmost solemnly admitted by France herself. The antiquity of these\r\nclaims, their high justice, and the aggravating circumstances out of\r\nwhich they arose are too familiar to the American people to require\r\ndescription. It is sufficient to say that for a period of ten years and\r\nupward our commerce was, with but little interruption, the subject of\r\nconstant aggression on the part of France--aggressions the ordinary\r\nfeatures of which were condemnations of vessels and cargoes under\r\narbitrary decrees, adopted in contravention as well of the laws of\r\nnations as of treaty stipulations, burnings on the high seas, and\r\nseizures and confiscations under special imperial rescripts in the\r\nports of other nations occupied by the armies or under the control of\r\nFrance. Such it is now conceded is the character of the wrongs we\r\nsuffered--wrongs in many cases so flagrant that even their authors\r\nnever denied our right to reparation. Of the extent of these injuries\r\nsome conception may be formed from the fact that after the burning of a\r\nlarge amount at sea and the necessary deterioration in other cases by\r\nlong detention the American property so seized and sacrificed at forced\r\nsales, excluding what was adjudged to privateers before or without\r\ncondemnation, brought into the French treasury upward of 24,000,000\r\nfrancs, besides large custom house duties.\r\n\r\nThe subject had already been an affair of 20 years' uninterrupted\r\nnegotiation, except for a short time when France was overwhelmed by the\r\nmilitary power of united Europe. During this period, whilst other\r\nnations were extorting from her payment of their claims at the point of\r\nthe bayonet, the United States intermitted their demand for justice out\r\nof respect to the oppressed condition of a gallant people to whom they\r\nfelt under obligations for fraternal assistance in their own days of\r\nsuffering and peril. The bad effects of these protracted and unavailing\r\ndiscussions, were obvious, and the line of duty was to my mind equally\r\nso.\r\n\r\nThis was either to insist upon the adjustment of our claims within a\r\nreasonable period or to abandon them altogether. I could not doubt that\r\nby this course the interests and honor of both countries would be best\r\nconsulted. Instructions were therefore given in this spirit to the\r\nminister who was sent out once more to demand reparation.\r\n\r\nUpon the meeting of Congress in December, 1829, I felt it my duty to\r\nspeak of these claims and the delays of France in terms calculated to\r\ncall the serious attention of both countries to the subject. The then\r\nFrench ministry took exception to the message on the ground of its\r\ncontaining a menace, under it was not agreeable to the French\r\nGovernment to negotiate. The American minister of his own accord\r\nrefuted the construction which was attempted to be put upon the message\r\nand at the same time called to the recollection of the French ministry\r\nthat the President's message was a communication addressed, not to\r\nforeign governments, but to the Congress of the United States, in which\r\nit was enjoined upon him by the Constitution to lay before that body\r\ninformation of the state of the Union, comprehending its foreign as\r\nwell as its domestic relations, and that if in the discharge of this\r\nduty he felt it incumbent upon him to summon the attention of Congress\r\nin due time to what might be the possible consequences of existing\r\ndifficulties with any foreign government, he might fairly be supposed\r\nto do so under a sense of his own Government, and not from any\r\nintention of holding a menace over a foreign power.\r\n\r\nThe views taken by him received my approbation, the French Government\r\nwas satisfied, and the negotiation was continued. It terminated in the\r\ntreaty of July 4th, recognizing the justice of our claims in part and\r\npromising payment to the amount of 25,000,000 francs in six annual\r\ninstallments.\r\n\r\nThe ratifications of this treaty were exchanged at Washington on the\r\nsecond of February, 1832, and in five days thereafter it was laid\r\nbefore Congress, who immediately passed the acts necessary on our part\r\nto secure to France the commercial advantages conceded to her in the\r\ncompact. The treaty had previously been solemnly ratified by the King\r\nof the French in terms which are certainly not mere matters of form,\r\nand of which the translation is as follows: WE, approving the above\r\nconvention in all and each of the dispositions which are contained in\r\nit, do declare, by ourselves as well as by our heirs and successors,\r\nthat it is accepted, approved, ratified, and confirmed, and by these\r\npresents, signed by our hand, we do accept, approve, ratify, and\r\nconfirm it; promising, on the faith and word of a king, to observe it\r\nand to cause it to be observed inviolably, without ever contravening it\r\nor suffering it to be contravened, directly or indirectly, for any\r\ncause or under any pretense whatsoever. Official information of the\r\nexchange of ratifications in the United States reached Paris whilst the\r\nChambers were in session. The extraordinary and to us injurious delays\r\nof the French Government in their action upon the subject of its\r\nfulfillment have been heretofore stated to Congress, and I have no\r\ndisposition to enlarge upon them here. It is sufficient to observe that\r\nthe then pending session was allowed to expire without even an effort\r\nto obtain the necessary appropriations; that the two succeeding ones\r\nwere also suffered to pass away without anything like a serious attempt\r\nto obtain a decision upon the subject, and that it was not until the\r\nfourth session, almost three years after the conclusion of the treaty\r\nand more than two years after the exchange of ratifications, that the\r\nbill for the execution of the treaty was pressed to a vote and\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the Government of the United States, having full\r\nconfidence that a treaty entered into and so solemnly ratified by the\r\nFrench King would be executed in good faith, and not doubting that\r\nprovision would be made for the payment of the first installment which\r\nwas to become due on the second day of February, 1833, negotiated a\r\ndraft for the amount through the Bank of the United States. When this\r\ndraft was presented by the holder with the credentials required by the\r\ntreaty to authorize him to receive the money, the Government of France\r\nallowed it to be protested. In addition to the injury in the nonpayment\r\nof the money by France, conformably to her engagement, the United\r\nStates were exposed to a heavy claim on the part of the bank under\r\npretense of damages, in satisfaction of which that institution seized\r\nupon and still retains an equal amount of the public money.\r\n\r\nCongress was in session when the decision of the Chambers reached\r\nWashington, and an immediate communication of this apparently final\r\ndecision of France not to fulfill the stipulation of the treaty was the\r\ncourse naturally to be expected from the President. The deep tone of\r\ndissatisfaction which pervaded the public mind and the correspondent\r\nexcitement produced in Congress by only a general knowledge of the\r\nresult rendered it more than probable that a resort to immediate\r\nmeasures of redress would be the consequence of calling the attention\r\nof that body to the subject. Sincerely desirous of preserving the\r\npacific relations which had so long existed between the two countries,\r\nI was anxious to avoid this course if I could be satisfied that by so\r\nneither the interests nor the honor of my country would be\r\ncompromitted. Without the fullest assurances on that point, I could not\r\nhope to acquit myself of the responsibility to be incurred in suffering\r\nCongress to adjourn without laying the subject before them. Those\r\nreceived by me were believed to be of that character.\r\n\r\nThat the feelings produced in the United States by the news of the\r\nrejection of the appropriation would be such as I have described them\r\nto have been was foreseen by the French Government, and prompt measures\r\nwere taken by it to prevent the consequence. The King in person\r\nexpressed through our minister at Paris his profound regret at the\r\ndecision of the Chambers, and promised to send forthwith a ship with\r\ndispatches to his minister here authorizing him to give such assurances\r\nas would satisfy the Government and people of the United States that\r\nthe treaty would yet be faithfully executed by France.\r\n\r\nThe national ship arrived, and the minister received his instructions.\r\nClaiming to act under the authority derived from them, he gave to this\r\ngovernment in the name of his the most solemn assurances that as soon\r\nafter the new elections as the charter would permit the French Chambers\r\nwould be convened and the attempt to procure the necessary\r\nappropriations renewed; that all the constitutional powers of the King\r\nand his ministers should be put in requisition to accomplish the\r\nobject, and he was understood, and so expressly informed by this\r\nGovernment at the time, to engage that the question should be pressed\r\nto a decision at a period sufficiently early to permit information of\r\nthe result to be communicated to Congress at the commencement of their\r\nnext session. Relying upon these assurances, I incurred the\r\nresponsibility, great as I regarded it to be, of suffering Congress to\r\nseparate without communicating with them upon the subject.\r\n\r\nThe expectations justly founded upon the promises thus solemnly made to\r\nthis Government by that of France were not realized. The French\r\nChambers met on the thirty-first of July, 1834, soon after the\r\nelection, and although our minister in Paris urged the French ministry\r\nto bring the subject before them, they declined doing so. He next\r\ninsisted that the Chambers, of prorogued without acting on the subject,\r\nshould be reassembled at a period so early that their action on the\r\ntreaty might be known in Washington prior to the meeting of Congress.\r\n\r\nThis reasonable request was not only declined, but the Chambers were\r\nprorogued to the 29th of December, a day so late that their decision,\r\nhowever urgently pressed, could not in all probability be obtained in\r\ntime to reach Washington before the necessary adjournment of Congress\r\nby the Constitution. The reasons given by the ministry for refusing to\r\nconvoke the Chambers at an earlier period were afterwards shewn not to\r\nbe insuperable by their actual convocation on the first of December\r\nunder a special call for domestic purposes, which fact, however, did\r\nnot become known to this Government until after the commencement of the\r\nlast session of Congress.\r\n\r\nThus disappointed in our just expectations, it became my imperative\r\nduty to consult with Congress in regard to the expediency of a resort\r\nto retaliatory measures in case the stipulations of the treaty should\r\nnot be speedily complied with, and to recommend such as in my judgment\r\nthe occasion called for. To this end an unreserved communication of the\r\ncase in all its aspects became indispensable. To have shrunk in making\r\nit from saying all that was necessary to its correct understanding, and\r\nthat the truth would justify, for fear of giving offense to others,\r\nwould have been unworthy of us. To have gone, on the other hand, a\r\nsingle step further for the purpose of wounding the pride of a\r\nGovernment and people with whom we had so many motives for cultivating\r\nrelations of amity and reciprocal advantage would have been unwise and\r\nimproper.\r\n\r\nAdmonished by the past of the difficulty of making even the simplest\r\nstatement of our wrongs without disturbing the sensibilities of those\r\nwho had by their position become responsible for their redress, and\r\nearnestly desirous of preventing further obstacles from that source, I\r\nwent out of my way to preclude a construction of the message by which\r\nthe recommendation that was made to Congress might be regarded as a\r\nmenace to France in not only disavowing such a design, but in declaring\r\nthat her pride and her power were too well known to expect anything\r\nfrom her fears. The message did not reach Paris until more than a month\r\nafter the Chambers had been in session, and such was the insensibility\r\nof the ministry to our rightful claims and just expectations that our\r\nminister had been informed that the matter when introduced would not be\r\npressed as a cabinet measure.\r\n\r\nAlthough the message was not officially communicated to the French\r\nGovernment, and not withstanding the declaration to the contrary which\r\nit contained, the French ministry decided to consider the conditional\r\nrecommendation of reprisals a menace and an insult which the honor of\r\nthe nation made it incumbent on them to resent. The measures resorted\r\nto by them to evince their sense of the supposed indignity were the\r\nimmediate recall of their minister at Washington, the offer of\r\npassports to the American minister at Paris, and a public notice to the\r\nlegislative Chambers that all diplomatic intercourse with the United\r\nStates had been suspended.\r\n\r\nHaving in this manner vindicated the dignity of France, they next\r\nproceeded to illustrate her justice. To this end a bill was immediately\r\nintroduced into the Chamber of Deputies proposing to make the\r\nappropriations necessary to carry into effect the treaty. As this bill\r\nsubsequently passed into a law, the provisions of which now constitute\r\nthe main subject of difficulty between the two nations, it becomes my\r\nduty, in order to place the subject before you in a clear light, to\r\ntrace the history of its passage and to refer with some particularity\r\nto the proceedings and discussions in regard to it.\r\n\r\nThe minister of finance in his opening speech alluded to the measures\r\nwhich had been adopted to resent the supposed indignity, and\r\nrecommended the execution of the treaty as a measure required by the\r\nhonor and justice of France. He as the organ of the ministry declared\r\nthe message, so long as it had not received the sanction of Congress, a\r\nmere expression of the personal opinion of the President, for which\r\nneither the Government nor people of the United States were\r\nresponsible, and that an engagement had been entered into for the\r\nfulfillment of which the honor of France was pledged. Entertaining\r\nthese views, the single condition which the French ministry proposed to\r\nannex to the payment of the money was that it should not be made until\r\nit was ascertained that the Government of the United States had done\r\nnothing to injure the interests of France, or, in other words, that no\r\nsteps had been authorized by Congress of a hostile character toward\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nWhat the disposition of action of Congress might be was then unknown to\r\nthe French cabinet; but on the 14th day of January the Senate resolved\r\nthat it was at that time inexpedient to adopt any legislative measures\r\nin regard to the state of affairs between the United States and France,\r\nand no action on the subject had occurred in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. These facts were known in Paris prior to the 28th of\r\nMarch, 1835, when the committee to whom the bill of indemnification had\r\nbeen referred reported it to the Chamber of Deputies. That committee\r\nsubstantially re-echoed the sentiments of the ministry, declared that\r\nCongress had set aside the proposition of the President, and\r\nrecommended the passage of the bill without any other restriction than\r\nthat originally proposed. Thus was it known to the French ministry and\r\nChambers that if the position assumed by them, and which had been so\r\nfrequently and solemnly announced as the only one compatible with the\r\nhonor of France, was maintained and the bill passed as originally\r\nproposed, the money would be paid and there would be an end of this\r\nunfortunate controversy.\r\n\r\nBut this cheering prospect was soon destroyed by an amendment\r\nintroduced into the bill at the moment of its passage, providing that\r\nthe money should not be paid until the French Government had received\r\nsatisfactory explanations of the President's message of the second\r\nDecember, 1834, and, what is still more extraordinary, the president of\r\nthe council of ministers adopted this amendment and consented to its\r\nincorporation in the bill. In regard to a supposed insult which had\r\nbeen formally resented by the recall of their minister and the offer of\r\npassports to ours, they now for the first time proposed to ask\r\nexplanations. Sentiments and propositions which they had declared could\r\nnot justly be imputed to the Government or people of the United States\r\nare set up as obstacles to the performance of an act of conceded\r\njustice to that Government and people. They had declared that the honor\r\nof France required the fulfillment of the engagement into which the\r\nKing had entered, unless Congress adopted the recommendations of the\r\nmessage. They ascertained that Congress did not adopt them, and yet\r\nthat fulfillment is refused unless they first obtain from the President\r\nexplanations of an opinion characterized by themselves as personal and\r\ninoperative.\r\n\r\nThe conception that it was my intention to menace or insult the\r\nGovernment of France is as unfounded as the attempt to extort from the\r\nfears of that nation what her sense of justice may deny would be vain\r\nand ridiculous. But the Constitution of the United States imposes on\r\nthe President the duty of laying before Congress the condition of the\r\ncountry in its foreign and domestic relations, and of recommending such\r\nmeasures as may in his opinion be required by its interests. From the\r\nperformance of this duty he can not be deterred by the fear of wounding\r\nthe sensibilities of the people or government of whom it may become\r\nnecessary to speak; and the American people are incapable of submitting\r\nto an interference by any government on earth, however powerful, with\r\nthe free performance of the domestic duties which the Constitution has\r\nimposed on their public functionaries.\r\n\r\nThe discussions which intervene between the several departments of our\r\nGovernment being to ourselves, and for anything said in them our public\r\nservants are only responsible to their own constituents and to each\r\nother. If in the course of their consultations facts are erroneously\r\nstated or unjust deductions are made, they require no other inducement\r\nto correct them, however informed of their error, than their love of\r\njustice and what is due to their own character; but they can never\r\nsubmit to be interrogated upon the subject as a matter of right by a\r\nforeign power. When our discussions terminate in acts, our\r\nresponsibility to foreign powers commences, not as individuals, but as\r\na nation. The principle which calls in question the President for the\r\nlanguage of his message would equally justify a foreign power in\r\ndemanding explanations of the language used in the report of a\r\ncommittee or by a member in debate.\r\n\r\nThis is not the first time that the Government of France has taken\r\nexception to the messages of American Presidents. President Washington\r\nand the first President Adams in the performance of their duties to the\r\nAmerican people fell under the animadversions of the French Directory.\r\nThe objection taken by the ministry of Charles X, and removed by the\r\nexplanation made by our minister upon the spot, has already been\r\nadverted to. When it was understood that the ministry of the present\r\nKing took exception to my message of last year, putting a construction\r\nupon it which was disavowed on its face, our late minister at Paris, in\r\nanswer to the note which first announced a dissatisfaction with the\r\nlanguage used in the message, made a communication to the French\r\nGovernment under date of the 29th of January, 1835, calculated to\r\nremove all impressions which an unreasonable susceptibility had\r\ncreated. He repeated and called the attention of the French Government\r\nto the disavowal contained in the message itself of any intention to\r\nintimidate by menace; he truly declared that it contained and was\r\nintended to contain no charge of ill faith against the King of the\r\nFrench, and properly distinguished between the right to complain in\r\nunexceptionable terms of the omission to execute an agreement and an\r\naccusation of bad motives in withholding such execution, and\r\ndemonstrated that the necessary use of that right ought not to be\r\nconsidered as an offensive imputation.\r\n\r\nAlthough this communication was made without instructions and entirely\r\non the minister's own responsibility, yet it was afterwards made the\r\nact of this Government by my full approbation, and that approbation was\r\nofficially made known on the 25th of April, 1835, to the French\r\nGovernment. It, however, failed to have any effect. The law, after this\r\nfriendly explanation, passed with the obnoxious amendment, supported by\r\nthe King's ministers, and was finally approved by the King.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States are justly attached to a pacific system\r\nin their intercourse with foreign nations. It is proper, therefore,\r\nthat they should know whether their Government has adhered to it. In\r\nthe present instance it has been carried to the utmost extent that was\r\nconsistent with a becoming self-respect. The note of the 29th of\r\nJanuary, to which I have before alluded, was not the only one which our\r\nminister took upon himself the responsibility of presenting on the same\r\nsubject and in the same spirit.\r\n\r\nFinding that it was intended to make the payment of a just debt\r\ndependent on the performance of a condition which he knew could never\r\nbe complied with, he thought it a duty to make another attempt to\r\nconvince the French Government that whilst self-respect and regard to\r\nthe dignity of other nations would always prevent us from using any\r\nlanguage that ought to give offense, yet we could never admit a right\r\nin any foreign government to ask explanations of or to interfere in any\r\nmanner in the communications which one branch of our public councils\r\nmade with another; that in the present case no such language had been\r\nused, and that this had in a former note been fully and voluntarily\r\nstate, before it was contemplated to make the explanation a condition;\r\nand that there might be no misapprehension he stated the terms used in\r\nthat note, and he officially informed them that it had been approved by\r\nthe President, and that therefore every explanation which could\r\nreasonably be asked or honorably given had been already made; that the\r\ncontemplated measure had been anticipated by a voluntary and friendly\r\ndeclaration, and was therefore not only useless, but might be deemed\r\noffensive, and certainly would not be complied with if annexed as a\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nWhen this latter communication, to which I especially invite the\r\nattention of Congress, was laid before me, I entertained the hope that\r\nthe means it was obviously intended to afford of an honorable and\r\nspeedy adjustment of the difficulties between the two nations would\r\nhave been accepted, and I therefore did not hesitate to give it my\r\nsanction and full approbation. This was due to the minister who had\r\nmade himself responsible for the act, and it was published to the\r\npeople of the United States and is now laid before their\r\nrepresentatives to shew how far their Executive has gone in its\r\nendeavors to restore a good understanding between the two countries. It\r\nwould have been at any time communicated to the Government of France\r\nhad it been officially requested.\r\n\r\nThe French Government having received all the explanation which honor\r\nand principle permitted, and which could in reason be asked, it was\r\nhoped it would no longer hesitate to pay the installments now due. The\r\nagent authorized to receive the money was instructed to inform the\r\nFrench minister of his readiness to do so. In reply to this notice he\r\nwas told that the money could not then be paid, because the formalities\r\nrequired by the act of the Chambers had not been arranged.\r\n\r\nNot having received any official information of the intentions of the\r\nFrench Government, and anxious to bring, as far as practicable, this\r\nunpleasant affair to a close before the meeting of Congress, that you\r\nmight have the whole subject before you, I caused our charge d'affaires\r\nat Paris to be instructed to ask for the final determination of the\r\nFrench Government, and in the event of their refusal to pay the\r\ninstallments now due, without further explanations to return to the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe result of this last application has not yet reached us, but is\r\ndaily expected. That it may be favorable is my sincere wish. France\r\nhaving now, through all the branches of her Government, acknowledged\r\nthe validity of our claims and the obligation of the treaty of 1831,\r\nand there really existing no adequate cause for further delay, will at\r\nlength, it may be hoped, adopt the course which the interests of both\r\nnations, not less than the principles of justice, so imperiously\r\nrequire. The treaty being once executed on her part, little will remain\r\nto disturb the friendly relations of the two countries--nothing,\r\nindeed, which will not yield to the suggestions of a pacific and\r\nenlightened policy and to the influence of that mutual good will and of\r\nthose generous recollections which we may confidently expect will then\r\nbe revived in all their ancient force.\r\n\r\nIn any event, however, the principle involved in the new aspect which\r\nhas been given to the controversy is so vitally important to the\r\nindependent administration of the Government that it can neither be\r\nsurrendered nor compromitted without national degradation. I hope it is\r\nunnecessary for me to say that such a sacrifice will not be made\r\nthrough any agency of mine. The honor of my country shall never be\r\nstained by an apology from me for the statement of truth and the\r\nperformance of duty; nor can I give any explanation of my official acts\r\nexcept such as is due to integrity and justice and consistent with the\r\nprinciples on which our institutions have been framed. This\r\ndetermination will, I am confident, be approved by my constituents. I\r\nhave, indeed, studied their character to but little purpose if the sum\r\nof 25,000,000 francs will have the weight of a feather in the\r\nestimation of what appertains to their national independence, and if,\r\nunhappily, a different impression should at any time obtain in any\r\nquarter, they will, I am sure, rally round the Government of their\r\nchoice with alacrity and unanimity, and silence for ever the degrading\r\nimputation.\r\n\r\nHaving thus frankly presented to you the circumstances which since the\r\nlast session of Congress have occurred in this interesting and\r\nimportant matter, with the views of the Executive in regard to them, it\r\nis at this time only necessary to add that when ever the advices now\r\ndaily expected from our charge d'affaires shall have been received they\r\nwill be made the subject of a special communication.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the public finances was never more flattering than at\r\nthe present period.\r\n\r\nSince my last annual communication all the remains of the public debt\r\nhave been redeemed, or money has been placed in deposit for this\r\npurpose when ever the creditors choose to receive it. All the other\r\npecuniary engagements of the Government have been honorably and\r\npromptly fulfilled, and there will be a balance in the Treasury at the\r\nclose of the year of about $19,000,000. It is believed that after\r\nmeeting all outstanding and unexpended appropriations there will remain\r\nnear $11,000,000 to be applied to any new objects which Congress may\r\ndesignate or to the more rapid execution of the works already in\r\nprogress. In aid of these objects, and to satisfy the current\r\nexpenditures of the ensuing year, it is estimated that there will be\r\nreceived from various sources $20,000,000 more in 1836.\r\n\r\nShould Congress make new appropriations in conformity with the\r\nestimates which will be submitted from the proper Departments,\r\namounting to about $24,000,000, still the available surplus at the\r\nclose of the next year, after deducting all unexpended appropriations,\r\nwill probably not be less than $6,000,000. This sum can, in my\r\njudgment, be now usefully applied to proposed improvements in our navy\r\nyards, and to new national works which are not enumerated in the\r\npresent estimates or to the more rapid completion of those already\r\nbegun. Either would be constitutional and useful, and would render\r\nunnecessary any attempt in our present peculiar condition to divide the\r\nsurplus revenue or to reduce it any faster than will be effected by the\r\nexisting laws.\r\n\r\nIn any event, as the annual report from the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nwill enter into details, shewing the probability of some decrease in\r\nthe revenue during the next seven years and a very considerable\r\ndeduction in 1842, it is not recommended that Congress should undertake\r\nto modify the present tariff so as to disturb the principles on which\r\nthe compromise act was passed. Taxation on some of the articles of\r\ngeneral consumption which are not in competition with our own\r\nproductions may be no doubt so diminished as to lessen to some extent\r\nthe source of this revenue, and the same object can also be assisted by\r\nmore liberal provisions for the subjects of public defense, which in\r\nthe present state of our prosperity and wealth may be expected to\r\nengage your attention.\r\n\r\nIf, however, after satisfying all the demands which can arise from\r\nthese sources the unexpended balance in the Treasury should still\r\ncontinue to increase, it would be better to bear with the evil until\r\nthe great changes contemplated in our tariff laws have occurred and\r\nshall enable us to revise the system with that care and circumspection\r\nwhich are due to so delicate and important a subject.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly our duty to diminish as far as we can the burdens of\r\ntaxation and to regard all the restrictions which are imposed on the\r\ntrade and navigation of our citizens as evils which we shall mitigate\r\nwhen ever we are not prevented by the adverse legislation and policy of\r\nforeign nations or those primary duties which the defense and\r\nindependence of our country enjoin upon us. That we have accomplished\r\nmuch toward the relief of our citizens by the changes which have\r\naccompanied the payment of the public debt and the adoption of the\r\npresent revenue laws is manifest from the fact that compared to 1833\r\nthere is a diminution of near $25,000,000 in the last two years, and\r\nthat our expenditures, independently of those for the public debt, have\r\nbeen reduced near $9,000,000 during the same period. Let us trust that\r\nby the continued observance of economy and by harmonizing the great\r\ninterests of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce much more may be\r\naccomplished to diminish the burdens of government and to increase\r\nstill further the enterprise and the patriotic affection of all classes\r\nof our citizens and all the members of our happy Confederacy. As the\r\ndata which the Secretary of the Treasury will lay before you in regard\r\nto our financial resources are full and extended, and will afford a\r\nsafe guide in your future calculations, I think it unnecessary to offer\r\nany further observations on that subject here.\r\n\r\nAmong the evidences of the increasing prosperity of the country, not\r\nthe least gratifying is that afforded by the receipts from the sales of\r\nthe public lands, which amount in the present year to the unexpected\r\nsum of $11,000,000. This circumstance attests the rapidity with which\r\nagriculture, the first and most important occupation of man, advances\r\nand contributes to the wealth and power of our extended territory.\r\nBeing still of the opinion that it is our best policy, as far as we can\r\nconsistently with the obligations under which those lands were ceded to\r\nthe United States, to promote their speedy settlement, I beg leave to\r\ncall the attention of the present Congress to the suggestions I have\r\noffered respecting it in my former messages.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary receipts from the sales of the public lands invite\r\nyou to consider what improvements the land system, and particularly the\r\ncondition of the General Land Office, may require. At the time this\r\ninstitution was organized, near a quarter century ago, it would\r\nprobably have been thought extravagant to anticipate for this period\r\nsuch an addition to its business as has been produced by the vast\r\nincrease of those sales during the past and present years. It may also\r\nbe observed that since the year 1812 the land offices and surveying\r\ndistricts have been greatly multiplied, and that numerous legislative\r\nenactments from year to year since that time have imposed a great\r\namount of new and additional duties upon that office, while the want of\r\na timely application of force commensurate with the care and labor\r\nrequired has caused the increasing embarrassment of accumulated arrears\r\nin the different branches of the establishment.\r\n\r\nThese impediments to the expedition of much duty in the General Land\r\nOffice induce me to submit to your judgment whether some modification\r\nof the laws relating to its organization, or an organization of a new\r\ncharacter, be not called for at the present juncture, to enable the\r\noffice to accomplish all the ends of its institution with a greater\r\ndegree of facility and promptitude than experience has proved to be\r\npracticable under existing regulations. The variety of the concerns and\r\nthe magnitude and complexity of the details occupying and dividing the\r\nattention of the Commissioner appear to render it difficult, if not\r\nimpracticable, for that officer by any possible assiduity to bestow on\r\nall the multifarious subjects upon which he is called to act the ready\r\nand careful attention due to their respective importance, unless the\r\nLegislature shall assist him by a law providing, or enabling him to\r\nprovide, for a more regular and economical distribution of labor, with\r\nthe incident responsibility among those employed under his direction.\r\nThe mere manual operation of affixing his signature to the vast number\r\nof documents issuing from his office subtracts so largely from the time\r\nand attention claimed by the weighty and complicated subjects daily\r\naccumulating in that branch of the public service as to indicate the\r\nstrong necessity of revising the organic law of the establishment. It\r\nwill be easy for Congress hereafter to proportion the expenditure on\r\naccount of this branch of the service to its real wants by abolishing\r\nfrom time to time the offices which can be dispensed with.\r\n\r\nThe extinction of the public debt having taken place, there is no\r\nlonger any use for the offices of Commissioners of Loans and of the\r\nSinking Fund. I recommend, therefore, that they be abolished, and that\r\nproper measures be taken for the transfer to the Treasury Department of\r\nany funds, books, and papers connected with the operations of those\r\noffices, and that the proper power be given to that Department for\r\nclosing finally any portion of their business which may remain to be\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\nIt is also incumbent on Congress in guarding the pecuniary interests of\r\nthe country to discontinue by such a law as was passed in 1812 the\r\nreceipt of the bills of the Bank of the United States in payment of the\r\npublic revenue, and to provide for the designation of an agent whose\r\nduty it shall be to take charge of the books and stock of the United\r\nStates in that institution, and to close all connection with it after\r\nthe 3d of March, 1833, when its charter expires. In making provision in\r\nregard to the disposition of this stock it will be essential to define\r\nclearly and strictly the duties and powers of the officer charged with\r\nthat branch of the public service.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the correspondence which the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury will lay before you that not withstanding the large amount of\r\nthe stock which the United States hold in that institution no\r\ninformation has yet been communicated which will enable the Government\r\nto anticipate when it can receive any dividends or derive any benefit\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nConnected with the condition of the finances and the flourishing state\r\nof the country in all its branches of industry, it is pleasing to\r\nwitness the advantages which have been already derived from the recent\r\nlaws regulating the value of the gold coinage. These advantages will be\r\nmore apparent in the course of the next year, when the branch mints\r\nauthorized to be established in North Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana\r\nshall have gone into operation. Aided, as it is hoped they will be, by\r\nfurther reforms in the banking systems of the States and by judicious\r\nregulations on the part of Congress in relation to the custody of the\r\npublic moneys, it may be confidently anticipated that the use of gold\r\nand silver as circulating medium will become general in the ordinary\r\ntransactions connected with the labor of the country.\r\n\r\nThe great desideratum in modern times is an efficient check upon the\r\npower of banks, preventing that excessive issue of paper whence arise\r\nthose fluctuations in the standard of value which render uncertain the\r\nrewards of labor. It was supposed by those who established the Bank of\r\nthe United States that from the credit given to it by the custody of\r\nthe public moneys and other privileges and the precautions taken to\r\nguard against the evils which the country had suffered in the\r\nbankruptcy of many of the State institutions of that period we should\r\nderive from that institution all the security and benefits of a sound\r\ncurrency and every good end that was attainable under the provision of\r\nthe Constitution which authorizes Congress alone to coin money and\r\nregulate the value thereof. But it is scarcely necessary now to say\r\nthat these anticipations have not been realized.\r\n\r\nAfter the extensive embarrassment and distress recently produced by the\r\nBank of the United States, from which the country is now recovering,\r\naggravated as they were by pretensions to power which defied the public\r\nauthority, and which if acquiesced in by the people would have changed\r\nthe whole character of our Government, every candid and intelligent\r\nindividual must admit that for the attainment of the great advantages\r\nof a sound currency we must look to a course of legislation radically\r\ndifferent from that which created such an institution.\r\n\r\nIn considering the means of obtaining so important an end we must set\r\naside all calculations of temporary convenience, and be influenced by\r\nthose only which are in harmony with the true character and the\r\npermanent interests of the Republic. We must recur to first principles\r\nand see what it is that has prevented the legislation of Congress and\r\nthe States on the subject of currency from satisfying the public\r\nexpectation and realizing results corresponding to those which have\r\nattended the action of our system when truly consistent with the great\r\nprinciple of equality upon which it rests, and with that spirit of\r\nforbearance and mutual concession and generous patriotism which was\r\noriginally, and must ever continue to be, the vital element of our\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nOn this subject I am sure that I can not be mistaken in ascribing our\r\nwant of success to the undue countenance which has been afforded to the\r\nspirit of monopoly. All the serious dangers which our system has yet\r\nencountered may be traced to the resort to implied powers and the use\r\nof corporations clothed with privileges, the effect of which is to\r\nadvance the interests of the few at the expense of the many.\r\n\r\nWe have felt but one class of these dangers exhibited in the contest\r\nwaged by the Bank of the United States against the Government for the\r\nlast four years. Happily they have been obviated for the present by the\r\nindignant resistance of the people, but we should recollect that the\r\nprinciple whence they sprung is an ever-active one, which will not fail\r\nto renew its efforts in the same and in other forms so long as there is\r\na hope of success, founded either on the inattention of the people or\r\nthe treachery of their representatives to the subtle progress of its\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nThe bank is, in fact, but one of the fruits of a system at war with the\r\ngenius of all our institutions--a system founded upon a political creed\r\nthe fundamental principle of which is a distrust of the popular will as\r\na safe regulator of political power, and whose great ultimate object\r\nand inevitable result, should it prevail, is the consolidation of all\r\npower in our system in one central government. Lavish public\r\ndisbursements and corporations with exclusive privileges would be its\r\nsubstitutes for the original and as yet sound checks and balances of\r\nthe Constitution--the means by whose silent and secret operation a\r\ncontrol would be exercised by the few over the political conduct of the\r\nmany by first acquiring that control over the labor and earnings of the\r\ngreat body of the people. Wherever this spirit has effected an alliance\r\nwith political power, tyranny and despotism have been the fruit. If it\r\nis ever used for the ends of government, it has to be incessantly\r\nwatched, or it corrupts the sources of the public virtue and agitates\r\nthe country with questions unfavorable to the harmonious and steady\r\npursuit of its true interests.\r\n\r\nWe are now to see whether, in the present favorable condition of the\r\ncountry, we can not take an effectual stand against the spirit of\r\nmonopoly, and practically prove in respect to the currency as well as\r\nother important interests that there is no necessity for so extensive a\r\nresort to it as that which has been heretofore practiced. The\r\nexperience of another year has confirmed the utter fallacy of the idea\r\nthat the Bank of the United States was necessary as a fiscal agent of\r\nthe Government. Without its aid as such, indeed, in despite of all the\r\nembarrassment it was in its power to create, the revenue has been paid\r\nwith punctuality by our citizens, the business of exchange, both\r\nforeign and domestic, has been conducted with convenience, and the\r\ncirculating medium has been greatly improved.\r\n\r\nBy the use of the State banks, which do not derive their charters from\r\nthe General Government and are not controlled by its authority, it is\r\nascertained that the moneys of the United States can be collected and\r\ndisbursed without loss or inconvenience, and that all the wants of the\r\ncommunity in relation to exchange and currency are supplied as well as\r\nthey have ever been before. If under circumstances the most unfavorable\r\nto the steadiness of the money market it has been found that the\r\nconsiderations on which the Bank of the United States rested its claims\r\nto the public favor were imaginary and groundless, it can not be\r\ndoubted that the experience of the future will be more decisive against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that without the agency of a great moneyed monopoly\r\nthe revenue can be collected and conveniently and safely applied to all\r\nthe purposes of the public expenditure. It is also ascertained that\r\ninstead of being necessarily made to promote the evils of an unchecked\r\npaper system, the management of the revenue can be made auxiliary to\r\nthe reform which the legislatures of several of the States have already\r\ncommenced in regard to the suppression of small bills, and which has\r\nonly to be fostered by proper regulations on the part of Congress to\r\nsecure a practical return to the extent required for the security of\r\nthe currency to the constitutional medium.\r\n\r\nSevered from the Government as political engines, and not susceptible\r\nof dangerous extension and combination, the State banks will not be\r\ntempted, nor will they have the power, which we have seen exercised, to\r\ndivert the public funds from the legitimate purposes of the Government.\r\nThe collection and custody of the revenue, being, on the contrary, a\r\nsource of credit to them, will increase the security which the States\r\nprovide for a faithful execution of their trusts by multiplying the\r\nscrutinies to which their operations and accounts will be subjected.\r\nThus disposed, as well from interest as the obligations of their\r\ncharters, it can not be doubted that such conditions as Congress may\r\nsee fit to adopt respecting the deposits in these institutions, with a\r\nview to the gradual disuse, of the small bills will be cheerfully\r\ncomplied with, and that we shall soon gain in place of the Bank of the\r\nUnited States a practical reform in the whole paper system of the\r\ncountry. If by this policy we can ultimately witness the suppression of\r\nall bank bills below $20, it is apparent that gold and silver will take\r\ntheir place and become the principal circulating medium in the common\r\nbusiness of the farmers and mechanics of the country. The attainment of\r\nsuch a result will form an era in the history of our country which will\r\nbe dwelt upon with delight by every true friend of its liberty and\r\nindependence. It will lighten the great tax which our paper system has\r\nso long collected from the earnings of labor, and do more to revive and\r\nperpetuate those habits of economy and simplicity which are so\r\ncongenial to the character of republicans than all the legislation\r\nwhich has yet been attempted.\r\n\r\nTo this subject I feel that I can not too earnestly invite the special\r\nattention of Congress, without the exercise of whose authority the\r\nopportunity to accomplish so much public good must pass unimproved.\r\nDeeply impressed with its vital importance, the Executive has taken all\r\nthe steps within his constitutional power to guard the public revenue\r\nand defeat the expectation which the Bank of the United States indulged\r\nof renewing and perpetuating its monopoly on the ground of its\r\nnecessity as a fiscal agent and as affording a sounder currency than\r\ncould be obtained without such an institution.\r\n\r\nIn the performance of this duty much responsibility was incurred which\r\nwould have been gladly avoided if the stake which the public had in the\r\nquestion could have been otherwise preserved. Although clothed with the\r\nlegal authority and supported by precedent, I was aware that there was\r\nin the act of the removal of the deposits a liability to excite that\r\nsensitiveness to Executive power which it is characteristic and the\r\nduty of free men to indulge; but I relied on this feeling also,\r\ndirected by patriotism and intelligence, to vindicate the conduct which\r\nin the end would appear to have been called for by the interests of my\r\ncountry. The apprehensions natural to this feeling that there may have\r\nbeen a desire, through the instrumentality of that measure, to extend\r\nthe Executive influence, or that it may have been prompted by motives\r\nnot sufficiently free from ambition, were not over-looked. Under the\r\noperation of our institutions the public servant who is called on to\r\ntake a step of high responsibility should feel in the freedom which\r\ngives rise to such apprehensions his highest security. When unfounded\r\nthe attention which they arouse and the discussions they excite deprive\r\nthose who indulge them of the power to do harm; when just they but\r\nhasten the certainty with which the great body of our citizens never\r\nfail to repel an attempt to procure the sanction to any exercise of\r\npower inconsistent with the jealous maintenance of their rights.\r\n\r\nUnder such convictions, and entertaining no doubt that my\r\nconstitutional obligations demanded the steps which were taken in\r\nreference to the removal of the deposits, it was impossible for me to\r\nbe deterred from the path of duty by a fear that my motives could be\r\nmisjudged or that political prejudices could defeat the just\r\nconsideration of the merits of my conduct. The result has shewn how\r\nsafe is this reliance upon the patriotic temper and enlightened\r\ndiscernment of the people. That measure has now been before them and\r\nhas stood the test of all the severe analysis which its general\r\nimportance, the interests it affected, and the apprehensions it excited\r\nwere calculated to produce, and it now remains for Congress to consider\r\nwhat legislation has become necessary in consequence.\r\n\r\nI need only add to what I have on former occasions said on this subject\r\ngenerally that in the regulations which Congress may prescribe\r\nrespecting the custody of the public moneys it is desirable that as\r\nlittle discretion as may be deemed consistent with their safe-keeping\r\nshould be given to the executive agents. No one can be more deeply\r\nimpressed than I am with the soundness of the doctrine which restrains\r\nand limits, by specific provisions, executive discretion, as far as it\r\ncan be done consistently with the preservation of its constitutional\r\ncharacter. In respect to the control over the public money this\r\ndoctrine is peculiarly applicable, and is in harmony with the great\r\nprinciple which I felt I was sustaining in the controversy with the\r\nBank of the United States, which has resulted in severing to some\r\nextent a dangerous connection between a moneyed and political power.\r\nThe duty of the Legislature to define, by clear and positive\r\nenactments, the nature and extent of the action which it belongs to the\r\nExecutive to superintend springs out of a policy analogous to that\r\nwhich enjoins upon all branches of the Federal Government an abstinence\r\nfrom the exercise of powers not clearly granted.\r\n\r\nIn such a Government, possessing only limited and specific powers, the\r\nspirit of its general administration can not be wise or just when it\r\nopposes the reference of all doubtful points to the great source of\r\nauthority, the States and the people, whose number and diversified\r\nrelations securing them against the influences and excitements which\r\nmay mislead their agents, make them the safest depository of power. In\r\nits application to the Executive, with reference to the legislative\r\nbranch of the Government, the same rule of action should make the\r\nPresident ever anxious to avoid the exercise of any discretionary\r\nauthority which can be regulated by Congress. The biases which may\r\noperate upon him will not be so likely to extend to the representatives\r\nof the people in that body.\r\n\r\nIn my former messages to Congress I have repeatedly urged the propriety\r\nof lessening the discretionary authority lodged in the various\r\nDepartments, but it has produced no effect as yet, except the\r\ndiscontinuance of extra allowances in the Army and Navy and the\r\nsubstitution of fixed salaries in the latter. It is believed that the\r\nsame principles could be advantageously applied in all cases, and would\r\npromote the efficiency and economy of the public service, at the same\r\ntime that greater satisfaction and more equal justice would be secured\r\nto the public officers generally.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying report of the Secretary of War will put you in\r\npossession of the operations of the Department confided to his care in\r\nall its diversified relations during the past year.\r\n\r\nI am gratified in being able to inform you that no occurrence has\r\nrequired any movement of the military force, except such as is common\r\nto a state of peace. The services of the Army have been limited to\r\ntheir usual duties at the various garrisons upon the Atlantic and\r\nin-land frontier, with the exceptions states by the Secretary of War.\r\nOur small military establishment appears to be adequate to the purposes\r\nfor which it is maintained, and it forms a nucleus around which any\r\nadditional force may be collected should the public exigencies\r\nunfortunately require any increase of our military means.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nAndrew Jackson\r\nDecember 5, 1836\r\n\r\nFellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nAddressing to you the last annual message I shall ever present to the\r\nCongress of the United States, it is a source of the most heartfelt\r\nsatisfaction to be able to congratulate you on the high state of\r\nprosperity which our beloved country has attained. With no causes at\r\nhome or abroad to lessen the confidence with which we look to the\r\nfuture for continuing proofs of the capacity of our free institutions\r\nto produce all the fruits of good government, the general condition of\r\nour affairs may well excite our national pride.\r\n\r\nI can not avoid congratulating you, and my country particularly, on the\r\nsuccess of the efforts made during my Administration by the Executive\r\nand Legislature, in conformity with the sincere, constant, and earnest\r\ndesire of the people, to maintain peace and establish cordial relations\r\nwith all foreign powers. Our gratitude is due to the Supreme Ruler of\r\nthe Universe, and I invite you to unite with me in offering to Him\r\nfervent supplications that His providential care may ever be extended\r\nto those who follow us, enabling them to avoid the dangers and the\r\nhorrors of war consistently with a just and indispensable regard to the\r\nrights and honor of our country. But although the present state of our\r\nforeign affairs, standing, without important change, as they did when\r\nyou separated in July last, is flattering in the extreme, I regret to\r\nsay that many questions of an interesting character, at issue with\r\nother powers, are yet unadjusted. Amongst the most prominent of these\r\nis that of our north east boundary. With an undiminished confidence in\r\nthe sincere desire of His Britannic Majesty's Government to adjust that\r\nquestion, I am not yet in possession of the precise grounds upon which\r\nit proposes a satisfactory adjustment.\r\n\r\nWith France our diplomatic relations have been resumed, and under\r\ncircumstances which attest the disposition of both Governments to\r\npreserve a mutually beneficial intercourse and foster those amicable\r\nfeelings which are so strongly required by the true interests of the\r\ntwo countries. With Russia, Austria, Prussia, Naples, Sweden, and\r\nDenmark the best understanding exists, and our commercial intercourse\r\nis gradually expanding itself with them. It is encouraged in all these\r\ncountries, except Naples, by their mutually advantageous and liberal\r\ntreaty stipulations with us.\r\n\r\nThe claims of our citizens on Portugal are admitted to be just, but\r\nprovision for the payment of them has been unfortunately delayed by\r\nfrequent political changes in that Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe blessings of peace have not been secured by Spain. Our connections\r\nwith that country are on the best footing, with the exception of the\r\nburdens still imposed upon our commerce with her possessions out of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe claims of American citizens for losses sustained at the bombardment\r\nof Antwerp have been presented to the Governments of Holland and\r\nBelgium, and will be pressed, in due season, to settlement.\r\n\r\nWith Brazil and all our neighbors of this continent we continue to\r\nmaintain relations of amity and concord, extending our commerce with\r\nthem as far as the resources of the people and the policy of their\r\nGovernments will permit. The just and long-standing claims of our\r\ncitizens upon some of them are yet sources of dissatisfaction and\r\ncomplaint. No danger is apprehended, however, that they will not be\r\npeacefully, although tardily, acknowledged and paid by all, unless the\r\nirritating effect of her struggle with Texas should unfortunately make\r\nour immediate neighbor, Mexico, an exception.\r\n\r\nIt is already known to you, by the correspondence between the two\r\nGovernments communicated at your last session, that our conduct in\r\nrelation to that struggle is regulated by the same principles that\r\ngoverned us in the dispute between Spain and Mexico herself, and I\r\ntrust that it will be found on the most severe scrutiny that our acts\r\nhave strictly corresponded with our professions. That the inhabitants\r\nof the United States should feel strong prepossessions for the one\r\nparty is not surprising. But this circumstance should of itself teach\r\nus great caution, lest it lead us into the great error of suffering\r\npublic policy to be regulated by partially or prejudice; and there are\r\nconsiderations connected with the possible result of this contest\r\nbetween the two parties of so much delicacy and importance to the\r\nUnited States that our character requires that we should neither\r\nanticipate events nor attempt to control them.\r\n\r\nThe known desire of the Texans to become a part of our system, although\r\nits gratification depends upon the reconcilement of various and\r\nconflicting interests, necessarily a work of time and uncertain in\r\nitself, is calculated to expose our conduct to misconstruction in the\r\neyes of the world. There are already those who, indifferent to\r\nprinciple themselves and prone to suspect the want of it in others,\r\ncharge us with ambitious designs and insidious policy.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive by the accompanying documents that the extraordinary\r\nmission from Mexico has been terminated on the sole ground that the\r\nobligations of this Government to itself and to Mexico, under treaty\r\nstipulations, have compelled me to trust a discretionary authority to a\r\nhigh officer of our Army to advance into territory claimed as part of\r\nTexas if necessary to protect our own or the neighboring frontier from\r\nIndian depredation. In the opinion of the Mexican functionary who has\r\njust left us, the honor of his country will be wounded by American\r\nsoldiers entering, with the most amicable avowed purposes, upon ground\r\nfrom which the followers of his Government have been expelled, and over\r\nwhich there is at present no certainty of a serious effort on its part\r\nto re-establish its dominion. The departure of this minister was the\r\nmore singular as he was apprised that the sufficiency of the causes\r\nassigned for the advance of our troops by the commanding general had\r\nbeen seriously doubted by me, and there was every reason to suppose\r\nthat the troops of the United States, their commander having had time\r\nto ascertain the truth or falsehood of the information upon which they\r\nhad been marched to Nacogdoches, would be either there in perfect\r\naccordance with the principles admitted to be just in his conference\r\nwith the Secretary of State by the Mexican minister himself, or were\r\nalready withdrawn in consequence of the impressive warnings their\r\ncommanding officer had received from the Department of War. It is hoped\r\nand believed that his Government will take a more dispassionate and\r\njust view of this subject, and not be disposed to construe a measure of\r\njustifiable precaution, made necessary by its known inability in\r\nexecution of the stipulations of our treaty to act upon the frontier,\r\ninto an encroachment upon its rights or a stain upon its honor.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the ancient complaints of injustice made on behalf of\r\nour citizens are disregarded, and new causes of dissatisfaction have\r\narisen, some of them of a character requiring prompt remonstrance and\r\nample and immediate redress. I trust, however, by tempering firmness\r\nwith courtesy and acting with great forbearance upon every incident\r\nthat has occurred or that may happen, to do and to obtain justice, and\r\nthus avoid the necessity of again bringing this subject to the view of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nIt is my duty to remind you that no provision has been made to execute\r\nour treaty with Mexico for tracing the boundary line between the two\r\ncountries. What ever may be the prospect of Mexico's being soon able to\r\nexecute the treaty on its part, it is proper that we should be in\r\nanticipation prepared at all times to perform our obligations, without\r\nregard to the probable condition of those with whom we have contracted\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe result of the confidential inquiries made into the condition and\r\nprospects of the newly declared Texan Government will be communicated\r\nto you in the course of the session.\r\n\r\nCommercial treaties promising great advantages to our enterprising\r\nmerchants and navigators have been formed with the distant Governments\r\nof Muscat and Siam. The ratifications have been exchanged, but have not\r\nreached the Department of State. Copes of the treaties will be\r\ntransmitted to you if received before, or published if arriving after,\r\nthe close of the present session of Congress.\r\n\r\nNothing has occurred to interrupt the good understanding that has long\r\nexisted with the Barbary Powers, nor to check the good will which is\r\ngradually growing up from our intercourse with the dominions of the\r\nGovernment of growing of the distinguished chief of the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\nInformation has been received at the Department of State that a treaty\r\nwith the Emperor of Morocco has just been negotiated, which, I hope,\r\nwill be received in time to be laid before the Senate previous to the\r\nclose of the session.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive from the report of the Secretary of the Treasury that\r\nthe financial means of the country continue to keep pace with its\r\nimprovement in all other respects. The receipts into the Treasury\r\nduring the present year will amount to about $47,691,898; those from\r\ncustoms being estimated at $22,523,151, those from lands at about\r\n$24,000,000, and the residue from miscellaneous sources. The\r\nexpenditures for all objects during the year are estimated not to\r\nexceed $32,000,000, which will leave a balance in the Treasury for\r\npublic purposes on the first day of January next of about $41,723,959.\r\nThis sum, with the exception of $5,000,000, will be transferred to\r\nthe several States in accordance with the provisions of the act\r\nregulating the deposits of the public money.\r\n\r\nThe unexpended balances of appropriation on the first day of January\r\nnext are estimated at $14,636,062, exceeding by $9,636,062 the amount\r\nwhich will be left in the deposit banks, subject to the draft of the\r\nTreasurer of the United States, after the contemplated transfers to the\r\nseveral States are made. If, therefore, the future receipts should not\r\nbe sufficient to meet these outstanding and future appropriations,\r\nthere may be soon a necessity to use a portion of the funds deposited\r\nwith the States.\r\n\r\nThe consequences apprehended when the deposit act of the last session\r\nreceived a reluctant approval have been measurably realized. Though an\r\nact merely for the deposit of the surplus moneys of the United States\r\nin the State treasuries for safe-keeping until they may be wanted for\r\nthe service of the General Government, it has been extensively spoken\r\nof as an act to give the money to the several States, and they have\r\nbeen advised to use it as a gift, without regard to the means of\r\nrefunding it when called for. Such a suggestion has doubtless been made\r\nwithout a proper attention to the various principles and interests\r\nwhich are affected by it.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that the law itself can not sanction such a suggestion,\r\nand that as it now stands the States have no more authority to receive\r\nand use these deposits without intending to return them than any\r\ndeposit bank or any individual temporarily charged with the\r\nsafe-keeping or application of the public money would now have for\r\nconverting the same to their private use without the consent and\r\nagainst the will of the Government. But independently of the violation\r\nof public faith and moral obligation which are involved in this\r\nsuggestion when examined in reference to the terms of the present\r\ndeposit act, it is believed that the considerations which should govern\r\nthe future legislation of Congress on this subject will be equally\r\nconclusive against the adoption of any measure recognizing the\r\nprinciples on which the suggestion has been made.\r\n\r\nConsidering the intimate connection of the subject with the financial\r\ninterests of the country and its great importance in whatever aspect it\r\ncan be viewed, I have bestowed upon it the most anxious reflection, and\r\nfeel it to be my duty to state to Congress such thoughts as have\r\noccurred to me, to aid their deliberation in treating it in the manner\r\nbest calculated to conduce to the common good.\r\n\r\nThe experience of other nations admonished us to hasten the\r\nextinguishment of the public debt; but it will be in vain that we have\r\ncongratulated each other upon the disappearance of this evil if we do\r\nnot guard against the equally great one of promoting the unnecessary\r\naccumulation of public revenue. No political maxim is better\r\nestablished than that which tells us that an improvident expenditure of\r\nmoney is the parent of profligacy, and that no people can hope to\r\nperpetuate their liberties who long acquiesce in a policy which taxes\r\nthem for objects not necessary to the legitimate and real wants of\r\ntheir Government. Flattering as is the condition of our country at the\r\npresent period, because of its unexampled advance in all the steps of\r\nsocial and political improvement, it can not be disguised that there is\r\na lurking danger already apparent in the neglect of this warning truth,\r\nand that the time has arrived when the representatives of the people\r\nshould be employed in devising some more appropriate remedy than now\r\nexists to avert it.\r\n\r\nUnder our present revenue system there is every probability that there\r\nwill continue to be a surplus beyond the wants of the Government, and\r\nit has become our duty to decide whether such a result be consistent\r\nwith the true objects of our Government.\r\n\r\nShould a surplus be permitted to accumulate beyond the appropriations,\r\nit must be retained in the Treasury, as it now is, or distributed among\r\nthe people or the States.\r\n\r\nTo retain it in the Treasury unemployed in any way is impracticable; it\r\nis, besides, against the genius of our free institutions to lock up in\r\nvaults the treasure of the nation. To take from the people the right of\r\nbearing arms and put their weapons of defense in the hands of a\r\nstanding army would be scarcely more dangerous to their liberties than\r\nto permit the Government to accumulate immense amounts of treasure\r\nbeyond the supplies necessary to its legitimate wants. Such a treasure\r\nwould doubtless be employed at some time, as it has been in other\r\ncountries, when opportunity tempted ambition.\r\n\r\nTo collect it merely for distribution to the States would seem to be\r\nhighly impolitic, if not as dangerous as the proposition to retain it\r\nin the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe shortest reflection must satisfy everyone that to require the\r\npeople to pay taxes to the Government merely that they may be paid back\r\nagain is sporting with the substantial interests of the country, and no\r\nsystem which produces such a result can be expected to receive the\r\npublic countenance. Nothing could be gained by it even if each\r\nindividual who contributed a portion of the tax could receive back\r\npromptly the same portion. But it is apparent that no system of the\r\nkind can ever be enforced which will not absorb a considerable portion\r\nof the money to be distributed in salaries and commissions to the\r\nagents employed in the process and in the various losses and\r\ndepreciations which arise from other causes, and the practical effect\r\nof such an attempt must ever be to burden the people with taxes, not\r\nfor purposes beneficial to them, but to swell the profits of deposit\r\nbanks and support a band of useless public officers.\r\n\r\nA distribution to the people is impracticable and unjust in other\r\nrespects. It would be taking one man's property and giving it to\r\nanother. Such would be the unavoidable result of a rule of equality\r\n(and none other is spoken of or would be likely to be adopted), in as\r\nmuch as there is no mode by which the amount of the individual\r\ncontributions of our citizens to the public revenue can be ascertained.\r\nWe know that they contribute unequally, and a rule, therefore, that\r\nwould distribute to them equally would be liable to all the objections\r\nwhich apply to the principle of an equal division of property. To make\r\nthe General Government the instrument of carrying this odious principle\r\ninto effect would be at once to destroy the means of its usefulness and\r\nchange the character designed for it by the framers of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nBut the more extended and injurious consequences likely to result from\r\na policy which would collect a surplus revenue from the purpose of\r\ndistributing it may be forcibly illustrated by an examination of the\r\neffects already produced by the present deposit act. This act, although\r\ncertainly designed to secure the safe-keeping of the public revenue, is\r\nnot entirely free in its tendencies from any of the objections which\r\napply to this principle of distribution. The Government had without\r\nnecessity received from the people a large surplus, which, instead of\r\nbeing employed as heretofore and returned to them by means of the\r\npublic expenditure, was deposited with sundry banks. The banks\r\nproceeded to make loans upon this surplus, and thus converted it into\r\nbanking capital, and in this manner it has tended to multiply bank\r\ncharters and has had a great agency in producing a spirit of wild\r\nspeculation. The possession and use of the property out of which this\r\nsurplus was created belonged to the people, but the Government has\r\ntransferred its possession to incorporated banks, whose interest and\r\neffort it is to make large profits out of its use. This process need\r\nonly be stated to show its injustice and bad policy.\r\n\r\nAnd the same observations apply to the influence which is produced by\r\nthe steps necessary to collect as well as to distribute such a revenue.\r\nAbout 3/5 of all the duties on imports are paid in the city of New\r\nYork, but it is obvious that the means to pay those duties are drawn\r\nfrom every quarter of the Union. Every citizen in every State who\r\npurchases and consumes an article which has paid a duty at that port\r\ncontributes to the accumulating mass. The surplus collected there must\r\ntherefore be made up of moneys or property withdrawn from other points\r\nand other States. Thus the wealth and business of every region from\r\nwhich these surplus funds proceed must be to some extent injured, while\r\nthat of the place where the funds are concentrated and are employed in\r\nbanking are proportionably extended. But both in making the transfer of\r\nthe funds which are first necessary to pay the duties and collect the\r\nsurplus and in making the re-transfer which becomes necessary when the\r\ntime arrives for the distribution of that surplus there is a\r\nconsiderable period when the funds can not be brought into use, and it\r\nis manifest that, besides the loss inevitable from such an operation,\r\nits tendency is to produce fluctuations in the business of the country,\r\nwhich are always productive of speculation and detrimental to the\r\ninterests of regular trade. Argument can scarcely be necessary to show\r\nthat a measure of this character ought not to receive further\r\nlegislative encouragement.\r\n\r\nBy examining the practical operation of the ration for distribution\r\nadopted in the deposit bill of the last session we shall discover other\r\nfeatures that appear equally objectionable. Let it be assumed, for the\r\nsake of argument, that the surplus moneys to be deposited with the\r\nStates have been collected and belong to them in the ration of their\r\nfederal representative population--an assumption founded upon the fact\r\nthat any deficiencies in our future revenue from imposts and public\r\nlands must be made up by direct taxes collected from the States in that\r\nration. It is proposed to distribute this surplus--say $30,000,000--not\r\naccording to the ration in which it has been collected and belongs to\r\nthe people of the States, but in that of their votes in the colleges of\r\nelectors of President and Vice President. The effect of a distribution\r\nupon that ration is shown by the annexed table, marked A.\r\n\r\nBy an examination of that table it will be perceived that in the\r\ndistribution of a surplus of $30,000,000 upon that basis there is a\r\ngreat departure from the principle which regards representation as the\r\ntrue measure of taxation, and it will be found that the tendency of\r\nthat departure will be to increase whatever inequalities have been\r\nsupposed to attend the operation of our federal system in respect to\r\nits bearings upon the different interests of the Union. In making the\r\nbasis of representation the basis of taxation the framers of the\r\nConstitution intended to equalize the burdens which are necessary to\r\nsupport the Government, and the adoption of that ratio, while it\r\naccomplished this object, was also the means of adjusting other great\r\ntopics arising out of the conflicting views respecting the political\r\nequality of the various members of the Confederacy. What ever,\r\ntherefore, disturbs the liberal spirit of the compromises which\r\nestablished a rule of taxation so just and equitable, and which\r\nexperience has proved to be so well adapted to the genius and habits of\r\nour people, should be received with the greatest caution and distrust.\r\n\r\nA bare inspection in the annexed table of the differences produced by\r\nthe ration used in the deposit act compared with the results of a\r\ndistribution according to the ration of direct taxation must satisfy\r\nevery unprejudiced mind that the former ration contravenes the spirit\r\nof the Constitution and produces a degree of injustice in the\r\noperations of the Federal Government which would be fatal to the hope\r\nof perpetuating it. By the ration of direct taxation, for example, the\r\nState of Delaware in the collection of $30,000,000 of revenue would pay\r\ninto the Treasury $188,716, and in a distribution of $30,000,000 she\r\nwould receive back from the Government, according to the ration of the\r\ndeposit bill, the sum of $306,122; and similar results would follow the\r\ncomparison between the small and the large States throughout the Union,\r\nthus realizing to the small States an advantage which would be\r\ndoubtless as unacceptable to them as a motive for incorporating the\r\nprinciple in any system which would produce it as it would be\r\ninconsistent with the rights and expectations of the large States.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly the intention of that provision of the Constitution\r\nwhich declares that \"all duties, imposts, and excises\" shall \"be\r\nuniform throughout the United States\" to make the burdens of taxation\r\nfall equally upon the people in what ever State of the Union they may\r\nreside. But what would be the value of such a uniform rule if the\r\nmoneys raised by it could be immediately returned by a different one\r\nwhich will give to the people of some States much more and to those of\r\nothers much less than their fair proportions? Were the Federal\r\nGovernment to exempt in express terms the imports, products, and\r\nmanufactures of some portions of the country from all duties while it\r\nimposed heavy ones on others, the injustice could not be greater. It\r\nwould be easy to show how by the operation of such a principle the\r\nlarge States of the Union would not only have to contribute their just\r\nshare toward the support of the Federal Government, but also have to\r\nbear in some degree the taxes necessary to support the governments of\r\ntheir smaller sisters; but it is deemed unnecessary to state the\r\ndetails where the general principle is so obvious.\r\n\r\nA system liable to such objections can never be supposed to have been\r\nsanctioned by the framers of the Constitution when they conferred on\r\nCongress the taxing power, and I feel persuaded that a mature\r\nexamination of the subject will satisfy everyone that there are\r\ninsurmountable difficulties in the operation of any plan which can be\r\ndevised of collecting revenue for the purpose of distributing it.\r\nCongress is only authorized to levy taxes \"to pay the debts and provide\r\nfor the common defense and general welfare of the United States\". There\r\nis no such provision as would authorize Congress to collect together\r\nthe property of the country, under the name of revenue, for the purpose\r\nof dividing it equally or unequally among the States or the people.\r\nIndeed, it is not probable that such an idea ever occurred to the\r\nStates when they adopted the Constitution. But however this may be, the\r\nonly safe rule for us in interpreting the powers granted to the Federal\r\nGovernment is to regard the absence of express authority to touch a\r\nsubject so important and delicate as this as equivalent to a\r\nprohibition.\r\n\r\nEven if our powers were less doubtful in this respect as the\r\nConstitution now stands, there are considerations afforded by recent\r\nexperience which would seem to make it our duty to avoid a resort to\r\nsuch a system. All will admit that the simplicity and economy of the\r\nState governments mainly depend on the fact that money has to be\r\nsupplied to support them by the same men, or their agents, who vote it\r\naway in appropriations. Hence when there are extravagant and wasteful\r\nappropriations there must be a corresponding increase of taxes, and the\r\npeople, becoming awakened, will necessarily scrutinize the character of\r\nmeasures which thus increase their burdens. By the watchful eye of\r\nself-interest the agents of the people in the State governments are\r\nrepressed and kept within the limits of a just economy.\r\n\r\nBut if the necessity of levying the taxes be taken from those who make\r\nthe appropriations and thrown upon a more distant and less responsible\r\nset of public agents, who have power to approach the people by an\r\nindirect and stealthy taxation, there is reason to fear that\r\nprodigality will soon supersede those characteristics which have thus\r\nfar made us look with so much pride and confidence to the State\r\ngovernments as the main-stay of our Union and liberties. The State\r\nlegislatures, instead of studying to restrict their State expenditures\r\nto the smallest possible sum, will claim credit for their profusion,\r\nand harass the General Government for increased supplies.\r\n\r\nPractically there would soon be but one taxing power, and that vested\r\nin a body of men far removed from the people, in which the farming and\r\nmechanic interests would scarcely be represented. The States would\r\ngradually lose their purity as well as their independence; they would\r\nnot dare to murmur at the proceedings of the General Government, lest\r\nthey should lose their supplies; all would be merged in a practical\r\nconsolidation, cemented by wide-spread corruption, which could only be\r\neradicated by one of those bloody revolutions which occasionally\r\nover-throw the despotic systems of the Old World.\r\n\r\nIn all the other aspects in which I have been able to look at the\r\neffect of such a principle of distribution upon the best interests of\r\nthe country I can see nothing to compensate for the disadvantages to\r\nwhich I have adverted. If we consider the protective duties, which are\r\nin a great degree the source of the surplus revenue, beneficial to one\r\nsection of the Union and prejudicial to another, there is no corrective\r\nfor the evil in such a plan of distribution. On the contrary, there is\r\nreason to fear that all the complaints which have sprung from this\r\ncause would be aggravated. Everyone must be sensible that a\r\ndistribution of the surplus must beget a disposition to cherish the\r\nmeans which create it, and any system, therefore, into which it enters\r\nmust have a powerful tendency to increase rather than diminish the\r\ntariff. If it were even admitted that the advantages of such a system\r\ncould be made equal to all the sections of the Union, the reasons\r\nalready so urgently calling for a reduction of the revenue would never\r\nthe less lose none of their force, for it will always be improbable\r\nthat an intelligent and virtuous community can consent to raise a\r\nsurplus for the mere purpose of dividing it, diminished as it must\r\ninevitably be by the expenses of the various machinery necessary to the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nThe safest and simplest mode of obviating all the difficulties which\r\nhave been mentioned is to collect only revenue enough to meet the wants\r\nof the Government, and let the people keep the balance of their\r\nproperty in their own hands, to be used for their own profit. Each\r\nState will then support its own government and contribute its due share\r\ntoward the support of the General Government. There would be no surplus\r\nto cramp and lessen the resources of individual wealth and enterprise,\r\nand the banks would be left to their ordinary means. Whatever\r\nagitations and fluctuations might arise from our unfortunate paper\r\nsystem, they could never be attributed, justly or unjustly, to the\r\naction of the Federal Government. There would be some guaranty that the\r\nspirit of wild speculation which seeks to convert the surplus revenue\r\ninto banking capital would be effectually checked, and that the scenes\r\nof demoralization which are now so prevalent through the land would\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nWithout desiring to conceal that the experience and observation of the\r\nlast two years have operated a partial change in my views upon this\r\ninteresting subject, it is never the less regretted that the\r\nsuggestions made by me in my annual messages of 1829 and 1830 have been\r\ngreatly misunderstood. At that time the great struggle was begun\r\nagainst that latitudinarian construction of the Constitution which\r\nauthorizes the unlimited appropriation of the revenues of the Union to\r\ninternal improvements within the States, tending to invest in the hands\r\nand place under the control of the General Government all the principal\r\nroads and canals of the country, in violation of State rights and in\r\nderogation of State authority.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the condition of the manufacturing interest was such\r\nas to create an apprehension that the duties on imports could not\r\nwithout extensive mischief be reduced in season to prevent the\r\naccumulation of a considerable surplus after the payment of the\r\nnational debt. In view of the dangers of such a surplus, and in\r\npreference to its application to internal improvements in derogation of\r\nthe rights and powers of the States, the suggestion of an amendment of\r\nthe Constitution to authorize its distribution was made. It was an\r\nalternative for what were deemed greater evils--a temporary resort to\r\nrelieve an over-burdened treasury until the Government could, without a\r\nsudden and destructive revulsion in the business of the country,\r\ngradually return to the just principle of raising no more revenue from\r\nthe people in taxes than is necessary for its economical support.\r\n\r\nEven that alternative was not spoken of but in connection with an\r\namendment of the Constitution. No temporary inconvenience can justify\r\nthe exercise of a prohibited power not granted by that instrument, and\r\nit was from a conviction that the power to distribute even a temporary\r\nsurplus of revenue is of that character that it was suggested only in\r\nconnection with an appeal to the source of all legal power in the\r\nGeneral Government, the States which have established it. No such\r\nappeal has been taken, and in my opinion a distribution of the surplus\r\nrevenue by Congress either to the States or the people is to be\r\nconsidered as among the prohibitions of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nAs already intimated, my views have undergone a change so far as to be\r\nconvinced that no alteration of the Constitution in this respect is\r\nwise or expedient. The influence of an accumulating surplus upon the\r\ncredit system of the country, producing dangerous extensions and\r\nruinous contractions, fluctuations in the price of property, rash\r\nspeculation, idleness, extravagance, and a deterioration of morals,\r\nhave taught us the important lesson that any transient mischief which\r\nmay attend the reduction of our revenue to the wants of our Government\r\nis to be borne in preference to an over-flowing treasury.\r\n\r\nI beg leave to call your attention to another subject intimately\r\nassociated with the preceding one--the currency of the country.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent from the whole context of the Constitution, as well as\r\nthe history of the times which gave birth to it, that it was the\r\npurpose of the Convention to establish a currency consisting of the\r\nprecious metals. These, from their peculiar properties which rendered\r\nthem the standard of value in all other countries, were adopted in this\r\nas well to establish its commercial standard in reference to foreign\r\ncountries by a permanent rule as to exclude the use of a mutable medium\r\nof exchange, such as of certain agricultural commodities recognized by\r\nthe statutes of some States as a tender for debts, or the still more\r\npernicious expedient of a paper currency.\r\n\r\nThe last, from the experience of the evils of the issues of paper\r\nduring the Revolution, had become so justly obnoxious as not only to\r\nsuggest the clause in the Constitution forbidding the emission of bills\r\nof credit by the States, but also to produce that vote in the\r\nConvention which negatived the proposition to grant power to Congress\r\nto charter corporations--a proposition well understood at the time as\r\nintended to authorize the establishment of a national bank, which was\r\nto issue a currency of bank notes on a capital to be created to some\r\nextent out of Government stocks. Although this proposition was refused\r\nby a direct vote of the Convention, the object was afterwards in effect\r\nobtained by its ingenious advocates through a strained construction of\r\nthe Constitution. The debts of the Revolution were funded at prices\r\nwhich formed no equivalent compared with the nominal amount of the\r\nstock, and under circumstances which exposed the motives of some of\r\nthose who participated in the passage of the act to distrust.\r\n\r\nThe facts that the value of the stock was greatly enhanced by the\r\ncreation of the bank, that it was well understood that such would be\r\nthe case, and that some of the advocates of the measure were largely\r\nbenefited by it belong to the history of the times, and are well\r\ncalculated to diminish the respect which might otherwise have been due\r\nto the action of the Congress which created the institution.\r\n\r\nOn the establishment of a national bank it became the interest of its\r\ncreditors that gold should be superseded by the paper of the bank as a\r\ngeneral currency. A value was soon attached to the gold coins which\r\nmade their exportation to foreign countries as a mercantile commodity\r\nmore profitable than their retention and use at home as money. It\r\nfollowed as a matter of course, if not designed by those who\r\nestablished the bank, that the bank became in effect a substitute for\r\nthe Mint of the United States.\r\n\r\nSuch was the origin of a national bank currency, and such the beginning\r\nof those difficulties which now appear in the excessive issues of the\r\nbanks incorporated by the various States.\r\n\r\nAlthough it may not be possible by any legislative means within our\r\npower to change at once the system which has thus been introduced, and\r\nhas received the acquiescence of all portions of the country, it is\r\ncertainly our duty to do all that is consistent with our constitutional\r\nobligations in preventing the mischiefs which are threatened by its\r\nundue extension. That the efforts of the fathers of our Government to\r\nguard against it by a constitutional provision were founded on an\r\nintimate knowledge of the subject has been frequently attested by the\r\nbitter experience of the country. The same causes which led them to refuse\r\ntheir sanction to a power authorizing the establishment of incorporations\r\nfor banking purposes now exist in a much stronger degree to urge us to\r\nexert the utmost vigilance in calling into action the means necessary\r\nto correct the evils resulting from the unfortunate exercise of the\r\npower, and it is hoped that the opportunity for effecting this great\r\ngood will be improved before the country witnesses new scenes of\r\nembarrassment and distress.\r\n\r\nVariableness must ever be the characteristic of a currency of which the\r\nprecious metals are not the chief ingredient, or which can be expanded\r\nor contracted without regard to the principles that regulate the value\r\nof those metals as a standard in the general trade of the world. With\r\nus bank issues constitute such a currency, and must ever do so until\r\nthey are made dependent on those just proportions of gold and silver as\r\na circulating medium which experience has proved to be necessary not\r\nonly in this but in all other commercial countries. Where those\r\nproportions are not infused into the circulation and do not control it,\r\nit is manifest that prices must vary according to the tide of bank\r\nissues, and the value and stability of property must stand exposed to\r\nall the uncertainty which attends the administration of institutions\r\nthat are constantly liable to the temptation of an interest distinct\r\nfrom that of the community in which they are established.\r\n\r\nThe progress of an expansion, or rather a depreciation, of the currency\r\nby excessive bank issues is always attended by a loss to the laboring\r\nclasses. This portion of the community have neither time nor\r\nopportunity to watch the ebbs and flows of the money market. Engaged\r\nfrom day to day in their useful toils, they do not perceive that\r\nalthough their wages are nominally the same, or even somewhat higher,\r\nthey are greatly reduced in fact by the rapid increase of a spurious\r\ncurrency, which, as it appears to make money abound, they are at first\r\ninclined to consider a blessing.\r\n\r\nIt is not so with the speculator, by whom this operation is better\r\nunderstood, and is made to contribute to his advantage. It is not until\r\nthe prices of the necessaries of life become so dear that the laboring\r\nclasses can not supply their wants out of their wages that the wages\r\nrise and gradually reach a justly proportioned rate to that of the\r\nproducts of their labor. When thus, by depreciation in consequence of\r\nthe quantity of paper in circulation, wages as well as prices become\r\nexorbitant, it is soon found that the whole effect of the adulteration\r\nis a tariff on our home industry for the benefit of the countries where\r\ngold and silver circulate and maintain uniformity and moderation in\r\nprices. It is then perceived that the enhancement of the price of land\r\nand labor produces a corresponding increase in the price of products\r\nuntil these products do not sustain a competition with similar ones in\r\nother countries, and thus both manufactured and agricultural\r\nproductions cease to bear expectation from the country of the spurious\r\ncurrency, because they can not be sold for cost.\r\n\r\nThis is the process by which specie is banished by the paper of the\r\nbanks. Their vaults are soon exhausted to pay for foreign commodities.\r\nThe next step is a stoppage of specie payment--a total degradation of\r\npaper as a currency--unusual depression of prices, the ruin of debtors,\r\nand the accumulation of property in the hands of creditors and cautious\r\ncapitalists.\r\n\r\nIt was in view of these evils, together with the dangerous power\r\nwielded by the Bank of the United States and its repugnance to our\r\nConstitution, that I was induced to exert the power conferred upon me\r\nby the American people to prevent the continuance of that institution.\r\nBut although various dangers to our republican institutions have been\r\nobviated by the failure of that bank to extort from the Government a\r\nrenewal of its charter, it is obvious that little has been accomplished\r\nexcept a salutary change of public opinion toward restoring to the\r\ncountry the sound currency provided for in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIn the acts of several of the States prohibiting the circulation of\r\nsmall notes and the auxiliary enactments of Congress at the last\r\nsession forbidding their reception or payment on public account, the\r\ntrue policy of the country has been advanced and a larger portion of\r\nthe precious metals infused into our circulating medium. These measures\r\nwill probably be followed up in due time by the enactment of State laws\r\nbanishing from circulation bank notes of still higher denominations,\r\nand the object may be materially promoted by further acts of Congress\r\nforbidding the employment as fiscal agents of such banks as continue to\r\nissue notes of low denominations and throw impediments in the way of\r\nthe circulation of gold and silver.\r\n\r\nThe effects of an extension of bank credits and over-issues of bank\r\npaper have been strikingly illustrated in the sales of the public\r\nlands. From the returns made by the various registers and receivers in\r\nthe early part of last summer it was perceived that the receipts\r\narising from the sales of the public lands were increasing to an\r\nunprecedented amount. In effect, however, these receipts amounted to\r\nnothing more than credits in bank. The banks lent out their notes to\r\nspeculators. They were paid to the receivers and immediately returned\r\nto the banks, to be lent out again and again, being mere instruments to\r\ntransfer to speculators the most valuable public land and pay the\r\nGovernment by a credit on the books of the banks.\r\n\r\nThose credits on the books of some of the Western banks, usually called\r\ndeposits, were already greatly beyond their immediate means of payment,\r\nand were rapidly increasing. Indeed, each speculation furnished means\r\nfor another; for no sooner had one individual or company paid in the\r\nnotes than they were immediately lent to another for a like purpose,\r\nand the banks were extending their business and their issues so largely\r\nas to alarm considerate men and render it doubtful whether these bank\r\ncredits, if permitted to accumulate, would ultimately be of the least\r\nvalue to the Government. The spirit of expansion and speculation was\r\nnot confined to the deposit banks, but pervaded the whole multitude of\r\nbanks throughout the Union and was giving rise to new institutions to\r\naggravate the evil.\r\n\r\nThe safety of the public funds and the interest of the people generally\r\nrequired that these operations should be checked; and it became the\r\nduty of every branch of the General and State Governments to adopt all\r\nlegitimate and proper means to produce that salutary effect. Under this\r\nview of my duty I directed the issuing of the order which will be laid\r\nbefore you by the Secretary of the Treasury, requiring payment for the\r\npublic lands sold to be made in specie, with an exception until the\r\n15th of the present month in favor of actual settlers.\r\n\r\nThis measure has produced many salutary consequences. It checked the\r\ncareer of the Western banks and gave them additional strength in\r\nanticipation of the pressure which has since pervaded our Eastern as\r\nwell as the European commercial cities. By preventing the extension of\r\nthe credit system it measurably cut off the means of speculation and\r\nretarded its progress in monopolizing the most valuable of the public\r\nlands. It has tended to save the new States from a non-resident\r\nproprietorship, one of the greatest obstacles to the advancement of a\r\nnew country and the prosperity of an old one. It has tended to keep\r\nopen the public lands for entry by emigrants at Government prices\r\ninstead of their being compelled to purchase of speculators at double\r\nor triple prices. And it is conveying into the interior large sums in\r\nsilver and gold, there to enter permanently into the currency of the\r\ncountry and place it on a firmer foundation. It is confidently believed\r\nthat the country will find in the motives which induced that order and\r\nthe happy consequences which will have ensued much to commend and\r\nnothing to condemn.\r\n\r\nIt remains for Congress if they approve the policy which dictated this\r\norder to follow it up in its various bearings. Much good, in my\r\njudgment, would be produced by prohibiting sales of the public lands\r\nexcept to actual settlers at a reasonable reduction of price, and to\r\nlimit the quantity which shall be sold to them. Although it is believed\r\nthe General Government never ought to receive anything but the\r\nconstitutional currency in exchange for the public lands, that point\r\nwould be of less importance if the lands were sold for immediate\r\nsettlement and cultivation. Indeed, there is scarcely a mischief\r\narising out of our present land system, including the accumulating\r\nsurplus of revenues, which would not be remedied at once by a\r\nrestriction on land sales to actual settlers; and it promises other\r\nadvantages to the country in general and to the new States in\r\nparticular which can not fail to receive the most profound\r\nconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nExperience continues to realize the expectations entertained as to the\r\ncapacity of the State banks to perform the duties of fiscal agents for\r\nthe Government at the time of the removal of the deposits. It was\r\nalleged by the advocates of the Bank of the United States that the\r\nState banks, what ever might be the regulations of the Treasury\r\nDepartment, could not make the transfers required by the Government or\r\nnegotiate the domestic exchanges of the country. It is now well\r\nascertained that the real domestic exchanges performed through\r\ndiscounts by the United States Bank and its 25 branches were at least\r\none third less than those of the deposit banks for an equal period of\r\ntime; and if a comparison be instituted between the amounts of service\r\nrendered by these institutions on the broader basis which has been used\r\nby the advocates of the United States Bank in estimating what they\r\nconsider the domestic exchanges transacted by it, the result will be\r\nstill more favorable to the deposit banks.\r\n\r\nThe whole amount of public money transferred by the Bank of the United\r\nStates in 1832 was $16,000,000. The amount transferred and actually\r\npaid by the deposit banks in the year ending the first of October last\r\nwas $39,319,899; the amount transferred and paid between that period\r\nand the 6th of November was $5,399,000, and the amount of transfer\r\nwarrants outstanding on that day was $14,450,000, making an aggregate\r\nof $59,168,894. These enormous sums of money first mentioned have been\r\ntransferred with the greatest promptitude and regularity, and the rates\r\nat which the exchanges have been negotiated previously to the passage\r\nof the deposit act were generally below those charged by the Bank of\r\nthe United States. Independently of these services, which are far\r\ngreater than those rendered by the United States Bank and its 25\r\nbranches, a number of the deposit banks have, with a commendable zeal\r\nto aid in the improvement of the currency, imported from abroad, at\r\ntheir own expense, large sums of the precious metals for coinage and\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner have nearly all the predictions turned out in\r\nrespect to the effect of the removal of the deposits--a step\r\nunquestionably necessary to prevent the evils which it was foreseen the\r\nbank itself would endeavor to create in a final struggle to procure a\r\nrenewal of its charter. It may be thus, too, in some degree with the\r\nfurther steps which may be taken to prevent the excessive issue of\r\nother bank paper, but it is to be hoped that nothing will now deter the\r\nFederal and State authorities from the firm and vigorous performance of\r\ntheir duties to themselves and to the people in this respect.\r\n\r\nIn reducing the revenue to the wants of the Government your particular\r\nattention is invited to those articles which constitute the necessaries\r\nof life. The duty on salt was laid as a war tax, and was no doubt\r\ncontinued to assist in providing for the payment of the war debt. There\r\nis no article the release of which from taxation would be felt so\r\ngenerally and so beneficially. To this may be added all kinds of fuel\r\nand provisions. Justice and benevolence unite in favor of releasing the\r\npoor of our cities from burdens which are not necessary to the support\r\nof our Government and tend only to increase the wants of the destitute.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by the report of the Secretary of the Treasury and the\r\naccompanying documents that the Bank of the United States has made no\r\npayment on account of the stock held by the Government in that\r\ninstitution, although urged to pay any portion which might suit its\r\nconvenience, and that it has given no information when payment may be\r\nexpected. Nor, although repeatedly requested, has it furnished the\r\ninformation in relation to its condition which Congress authorized the\r\nSecretary to collect at their last session. Such measures as are within\r\nthe power of the Executive have been taken to ascertain the value of\r\nthe stock and procure the payment as early as possible.\r\n\r\nThe conduct and present condition of that bank and the great amount of\r\ncapital vested in it by the United States require your careful\r\nattention. Its charter expired on the third day of March last, and it\r\nhas now no power but that given in the twenty-first section, \"to use\r\nthe corporate name, style, and capacity for the purpose of suits for\r\nthe final settlement and liquidation of the affairs and accounts of the\r\ncorporation, and for the sale and disposition of their estate--real,\r\npersonal, and mixed--but not for any other purpose or in any other\r\nmanner what so ever, nor for a period exceeding two years after the\r\nexpiration of the said term of incorporation\".\r\n\r\nBefore the expiration of the charter the stock-holders of the bank\r\nobtained an act of incorporation from the legislature of Pennsylvania,\r\nexcluding only the United States. Instead of proceeding to wind up\r\ntheir concerns and pay over to the United States the amount due on\r\naccount of the stock held by them, the president and directors of the\r\nold bank appear to have transferred the books, papers, notes,\r\nobligations, and most or all of its property to this new corporation,\r\nwhich entered upon business as a continuation of the old concern.\r\n\r\nAmongst other acts of questionable validity, the notes of the expired\r\ncorporation are known to have been used as its own and again put in\r\ncirculation. That the old bank had no right to issue or re-issue its\r\nnotes after the expiration of its charter can not be denied, and that\r\nit could not confer any such right on its substitute any more than\r\nexercise it itself is equally plain. In law and honesty the notes of\r\nthe bank in circulation at the expiration of its charter should have\r\nbeen called in by public advertisement, paid up as presented, and,\r\ntogether with those on hand, canceled and destroyed.\r\n\r\nTheir re-issue is sanctioned by no law and warranted by no necessity.\r\nIf the United States be responsible in their stock for the payment of\r\nthese notes, their re-issue by the new corporation for their own profit\r\nis a fraud on the Government. If the United States is not responsible,\r\nthen there is no legal responsibility in any quarter, and it is a fraud\r\non the country. They are the redeemed notes of a dissolved partnership,\r\nbut, contrary to the wishes of the retiring partner and without his\r\nconsent, are again re-issued and circulated.\r\n\r\nIt is the high and peculiar duty of Congress to decide whether any\r\nfurther legislation be necessary for the security of the large amount\r\nof public property now held and in use by the new bank, and for\r\nvindicating the rights of the Government and compelling a speedy and\r\nhonest settlement with all the creditors of the old bank, public and\r\nprivate, or whether the subject shall be left to the power now\r\npossessed by the Executive and judiciary. It remains to be seen whether\r\nthe persons who as managers of the old bank undertook to control the\r\nGovernment, retained the public dividends, shut their doors upon a\r\ncommittee of the House of Representatives, and filled the country with\r\npanic to accomplish their own sinister objects may now as managers of a\r\nnew bank continue with impunity to flood the country with a spurious\r\ncurrency, use the $7 millions of Government stock for their own profit,\r\nand refuse to the United States all information as to the present\r\ncondition of their own property and the prospect of recovering it into\r\ntheir own possession.\r\n\r\nThe lessons taught by the Bank of the United States can not well be\r\nlost upon the American people. They will take care never again to place\r\nso tremendous a power in irresponsible hands, and it will be fortunate\r\nif they seriously consider the consequences which are likely to result\r\non a smaller scale from the facility with which corporate powers are\r\ngranted by their State governments.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the law of the last session regulating the deposit\r\nbanks operates onerously and unjustly upon them in many respects, and\r\nit is hoped that Congress, on proper representations, will adopt the\r\nmodifications which are necessary to prevent this consequence.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War ad interim and the accompanying\r\ndocuments, all which are herewith laid before you, will give you a full\r\nview of the diversified and important operations of that Department\r\nduring the past year.\r\n\r\nThe military movements rendered necessary by the aggressions of the\r\nhostile portions of the Seminole and Creek tribes of Indians, and by\r\nother circumstances, have required the active employment of nearly our\r\nwhole regular force, including the Marine Corps, and of large bodies of\r\nmilitia and volunteers. With all these events so far as they were known\r\nat the seat of Government before the termination of your last session\r\nyou are already acquainted, and it is therefore only needful in this\r\nplace to lay before you a brief summary of what has since occurred.\r\n\r\nThe war with the Seminoles during the summer was on our part chiefly\r\nconfined to the protection of our frontier settlements from the\r\nincursions of the enemy, and, as a necessary and important means for\r\nthe accomplishment of that end, to the maintenance of the posts\r\npreviously established. In the course of this duty several actions took\r\nplace, in which the bravery and discipline of both officers and men\r\nwere conspicuously displayed, and which I have deemed it proper to\r\nnotice in respect to the former by the granting of brevet rank for\r\ngallant services in the field. But as the force of the Indians was not\r\nso far weakened by these partial successes as to lead them to submit,\r\nand as their savage inroads were frequently repeated, early measures\r\nwere taken for placing at the disposal of Governor Call, who as\r\ncommander in chief of the Territorial militia had been temporarily\r\ninvested with the command, an ample force for the purpose of resuming\r\noffensive operations in the most efficient manner so soon as the season\r\nshould permit. Major General Jesup was also directed, on the conclusion\r\nof his duties in the Creek country, to repair to Florida and assume the\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nThe result of the first movement made by the forces under the direction\r\nof Governor Call in October last, as detailed in the accompanying\r\npapers, excited much surprise and disappointment. A full explanation\r\nhas been required of the causes which led to the failure of that\r\nmovement, but has not yet been received. In the mean time, as it was\r\nfeared that the health of Governor Call, who was understood to have\r\nsuffered much from sickness, might not be adequate to the crisis, and\r\nas Major General Jesup was known to have reached Florida, that officer\r\nwas directed to assume command, and to prosecute all needful operations\r\nwith the utmost promptitude and vigor. From the force at his disposal\r\nand the dispositions he has made and is instructed to make, and from\r\nthe very efficient measures which it is since ascertained have been\r\ntaken by Governor Call, there is reason to hope that they will soon be\r\nenabled to reduce the enemy to subjection. In the mean time, as you\r\nwill perceive from the report of the Secretary, there is urgent\r\nnecessity for further appropriations to suppress these hostilities.\r\n\r\nHappily for the interests of humanity, the hostilities with the Creeks\r\nwere brought to a close soon after your adjournment, without that\r\neffusion of blood which at one time was apprehended as inevitable. The\r\nunconditional submission of the hostile party was followed by their\r\nspeedy removal to the country assigned them West of the Mississippi.\r\nThe inquiry as to alleged frauds in the purchase of the reservations of\r\nthese Indians and the causes of their hostilities, requested by the\r\nresolution of the House of Representatives of the first of July last\r\nJuly 1st, 1836 to be made by the President, is now going on through the\r\nagency of commissioners appointed for that purpose. Their report may be\r\nexpected during your present session.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties apprehended in the Cherokee country have been\r\nprevented, and the peace and safety of that region and its vicinity\r\neffectually secured, by the timely measures taken by the War\r\nDepartment, and still continued.\r\n\r\nThe discretionary authority given to General Gaines to cross the Sabine\r\nand to occupy a position as far West as Nacogdoches, in case he should\r\ndeem such a step necessary to the protection of the frontier and to the\r\nfulfillment of the stipulations contained in our treaty with Mexico,\r\nand the movement subsequently made by that officer have been alluded to\r\nin a former part of this message. At the date of the latest\r\nintelligence from Nacogdoches our troops were yet at that station, but\r\nthe officer who has succeeded General Gaines has recently been advised\r\nthat from the facts known at the seat of Government there would seem to\r\nbe no adequate cause for any longer maintaining that position, and he\r\nwas accordingly instructed, in case the troops were not already\r\nwithdrawn under the discretionary powers before possessed by him, to\r\ngive the requisite orders for that purpose on the receipt of the\r\ninstructions, unless he shall then have in his possession such\r\ninformation as shall satisfy him that the maintenance of the post is\r\nessential to the protection of our frontiers and to the due execution\r\nof our treaty stipulations, as previously explained to him.\r\n\r\nWhilst the necessities existing during the present year for the service\r\nof militia and volunteers have furnished new proofs of the patriotism\r\nof our fellow citizens, they have also strongly illustrated the\r\nimportance of an increase in the rank and file of the Regular Army. The\r\nviews of this subject submitted by the Secretary of War in his report\r\nmeet my entire concurrence, and are earnestly commended to the\r\ndeliberate attention of Congress. In this connection it is also proper\r\nto remind you that the defects in our present militia system are every\r\nday rendered more apparent. The duty of making further provision by law\r\nfor organizing, arming, and disciplining this arm of defense has been\r\nso repeatedly presented to Congress by myself and my predecessors that\r\nI deem it sufficient on this occasion to refer to the last annual\r\nmessage and to former Executive communications in which the subject has\r\nbeen discussed.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the reports of the officers charged with mustering into\r\nservice the volunteers called for under the act of Congress of the last\r\nsession that more presented themselves at the place of rendezvous in\r\nTennessee than were sufficient to meet the requisition which had been\r\nmade by the Secretary of War upon the governor of that State. This was\r\noccasioned by the omission of the governor to apportion the requisition\r\nto the different regiments of militia so as to obtain the proper number\r\nof troops and no more. It seems but just to the patriotic citizens who\r\nrepaired to the general rendezvous under circumstances authorizing them\r\nto believe that their services were needed and would be accepted that\r\nthe expenses incurred by them while absent from their homes should be\r\npaid by the Government. I accordingly recommend that a law to this\r\neffect be passed by Congress, giving them a compensation which will\r\ncover their expenses on the march to and from the place of rendezvous\r\nand while there; in connection with which it will also be proper to\r\nmake provision for such other equitable claims growing out of the\r\nservice of the militia as may not be embraced in the existing laws.\r\n\r\nOn the unexpected breaking out of hostilities in Florida, Alabama, and\r\nGeorgia it became necessary in some cases to take the property of\r\nindividuals for public use. Provision should be made by law for\r\nindemnifying the owners; and I would also respectfully suggest whether\r\nsome provision may not be made, consistently with the principles of our\r\nGovernment, for the relief of the sufferers by Indian depredations or\r\nby the operations of our own troops.\r\n\r\nNo time was lost after the making of the requisite appropriations in\r\nresuming the great national work of completing the unfinished\r\nfortifications on our sea-board and of placing them in a proper state\r\nof defense. In consequence, however, of the very late day at which\r\nthose bills were passed, but little progress could be made during the\r\nseason which has just closed. A very large amount of the moneys granted\r\nat your last session accordingly remains unexpended; but as the work\r\nwill be again resumed at the earliest moment in the coming spring, the\r\nbalance of the existing appropriations, and in several cases which will\r\nbe laid before you, with the proper estimates, further sums for the\r\nlike objects, may be usefully expended during the next year.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations of an increase in the Engineer Corps and for a\r\nreorganization of the Topographical Corps, submitted to you in my last\r\nannual message, derive additional strength from the great\r\nembarrassments experienced during the present year in those branches of\r\nthe service, and under which they are now suffering. Several of the\r\nmost important surveys and constructions directed by recent laws have\r\nbeen suspended in consequence of the want of adequate force in these\r\ncorps.\r\n\r\nThe like observations may be applied to the Ordnance Corps and to the\r\ngeneral staff, the operations of which as they are now organized must\r\neither be frequently interrupted or performed by officers taken from\r\nthe line of the Army, to the great prejudice of the service.\r\n\r\nFor a general view of the condition of the Military Academy and of\r\nother branches of the military service not already noticed, as well as\r\nfor further illustrations of those which have been mentioned, I refer\r\nyou to the accompanying documents, and among the various proposals\r\ncontained therein for legislative action I would particularly notice\r\nthe suggestion of the Secretary of War for the revision of the pay of\r\nthe Army as entitled to your favorable regard.\r\n\r\nThe national policy, founded alike in interest and in humanity, so long\r\nand so steadily pursued by this Government for the removal of the\r\nIndian tribes originally settled on this side of the Mississippi to the\r\nW of that river, may be said to have been consummated by the conclusion\r\nof the late treaty with the Cherokees. The measures taken in the\r\nexecution of that treaty and in relation to our Indian affairs\r\ngenerally will fully appear by referring to the accompanying papers.\r\nWithout dwelling on the numerous and important topics embraced in them,\r\nI again invite your attention to the importance of providing a\r\nwell-digested and comprehensive system for the protection, supervision,\r\nand improvement of the various tribes now planted in the Indian\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions submitted by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and\r\nenforced by the Secretary, on this subject, and also in regard to the\r\nestablishment of additional military posts in the Indian country, are\r\nentitled to your profound consideration. Both measures are necessary,\r\nfor the double purpose of protecting the Indians from intestine war,\r\nand in other respects complying with our engagements with them, and of\r\nsecuring our western frontier against incursions which otherwise will\r\nassuredly be made on it. The best hopes of humanity in regard to the\r\naboriginal race, the welfare of our rapidly extending settlements, and\r\nthe honor of the United States are all deeply involved in the relations\r\nexisting between this Government and the emigrating tribes. I trust,\r\ntherefore, that the various matters submitted in the accompanying\r\ndocuments in respect to those relations will receive your early and\r\nmature deliberation, and that it may issue in the adoption of\r\nlegislative measures adapted to the circumstances and duties of the\r\npresent crisis.\r\n\r\nYou are referred to the report of the Secretary of the Navy for a\r\nsatisfactory view of the operations of the Department under his charge\r\nduring the present year. In the construction of vessels at the\r\ndifferent navy yards and in the employment of our ships and squadrons\r\nat sea that branch of the service has been actively and usefully\r\nemployed. While the situation of our commercial interests in the West\r\nIndies required a greater number than usual of armed vessels to be kept\r\non that station, it is gratifying to perceive that the protection due\r\nto our commerce in other quarters of the world has not proved\r\ninsufficient. Every effort has been made to facilitate the equipment of\r\nthe exploring expedition authorized by the act of the last session, but\r\nall the preparation necessary to enable it to sail has not yet been\r\ncompleted. No means will be spared by the Government to fit out the\r\nexpedition on a scale corresponding with the liberal appropriations for\r\nthe purpose and with the elevated character of the objects which are to\r\nbe effected by it.\r\n\r\nI beg leave to renew the recommendation made in my last annual message\r\nrespecting the enlistment of boys in our naval service, and to urge\r\nupon your attention the necessity of further appropriations to increase\r\nthe number of ships afloat and to enlarge generally the capacity and\r\nforce of the Navy. The increase of our commerce and our position in\r\nregard to the other powers of the world will always make it our policy\r\nand interest to cherish the great naval resources of our country.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Post Master General presents a gratifying picture of\r\nthe condition of the Post Office Department. Its revenues for the year\r\nending the 30th June last were $3,398,455.19, showing an increase of\r\nrevenue over that of the preceding year of $404,878.53, or more than\r\n13%. The expenditures for the same year were $2,755,623.76, exhibiting\r\na surplus of $642,831.43. The Department has been redeemed from\r\nembarrassment and debt, has accumulated a surplus exceeding half a\r\nmillion dollars, has largely extended and is preparing still further to\r\nextend the mail service, and recommends a reduction of postages equal\r\nto about 20%. It is practicing upon the great principle which should\r\ncontrol every branch of our Government of rendering to the public the\r\ngreatest good possible with the least possible taxation to the people.\r\n\r\nThe scale of postages suggested by the Post Master General recommends\r\nitself, not only by the reduction it proposes, but by the simplicity of\r\nits arrangement, its conformity with the Federal currency, and the\r\nimprovement it will introduce into the accounts of the Department and\r\nits agents.\r\n\r\nYour particular attention is invited to the subject of mail contracts\r\nwith railroad companies. The present laws providing for the making of\r\ncontracts are based upon the presumption that competition among bidders\r\nwill secure the service at a fair price; but on most of the railroad\r\nlines there is no competition in that kind of transportation, and\r\nadvertising is therefore useless. No contract can now be made with them\r\nexcept such as shall be negotiated before the time of offering or\r\nafterwards, and the power of the Post Master General to pay them high\r\nprices is practically without limitation. It would be a relief to him\r\nand no doubt would conduce to the public interest to prescribe by law\r\nsome equitable basis upon which such contracts shall rest, and restrict\r\nhim by a fixed rule of allowance. Under a liberal act of that sort he\r\nwould undoubtedly be able to secure the services of most of the\r\nrailroad companies, and the interest of the Department would be thus\r\nadvanced.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence between the people of the United States and the\r\nEuropean nations, and particularly with the British Islands, has become\r\nvery extensive, and requires the interposition of Congress to give it\r\nsecurity. No obstacle is perceived to an interchange of mails between\r\nNew York and Liverpool or other foreign ports, as proposed by the Post\r\nMaster General. On the contrary, it promises, by the security it will\r\nafford, to facilitate commercial transactions and give rise to an\r\nenlarged intercourse among the people of different nations, which can\r\nnot but have a happy effect. Through the city of New York most of the\r\ncorrespondence between the Canadas and Europe is now carried on, and\r\nurgent representations have been received from the head of the\r\nprovincial post office asking the interposition of the United States to\r\nguard it from the accidents and losses to which it is now subjected.\r\nSome legislation appears to be called for as well by our own interest\r\nas by comity to the adjoining British provinces.\r\n\r\nThe expediency of providing a fire-proof building for the important\r\nbooks and papers of the Post Office Department is worthy of\r\nconsideration. In the present condition of our Treasury it is neither\r\nnecessary nor wise to leave essential public interests exposed to so\r\nmuch danger when they can so readily be made secure. There are weighty\r\nconsiderations in the location of a new building for that Department in\r\nfavor of placing it near the other executive buildings.\r\n\r\nThe important subjects of a survey of the coast and the manufacture of\r\na standard of weights and measures for the different custom houses have\r\nbeen in progress for some years under the general direction of the\r\nExecutive and the immediate superintendence of a gentleman possessing\r\nhigh scientific attainments. At the last session of Congress the making\r\nof a set of weights and measures for each State in the Union was added\r\nto the others by a joint resolution.\r\n\r\nThe care and correspondence as to all these subjects have been devolved\r\non the Treasury Department during the last year. A special report from\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury will soon be communicated to Congress,\r\nwhich will show what has been accomplished as to the whole, the number\r\nand compensation of the persons now employed in these duties, and the\r\nprogress expected to be made during the ensuing year, with a copy of\r\nthe various correspondence deemed necessary to throw light on the\r\nsubjects which seem to require additional legislation.\r\n\r\nClaims have been made for retrospective allowances in behalf of the\r\nsuperintendent and some of his assistants, which I did not feel\r\njustified in granting. Other claims have been made for large increases\r\nin compensation, which, under the circumstances of the several cases, I\r\ndeclined making without the express sanction of Congress. In order to\r\nobtain that sanction the subject was at the last session, on my\r\nsuggestion and by request of the immediate superintendent, submitted by\r\nthe Treasury Department to the Committee on Commerce of the House of\r\nRepresentatives. But no legislative action having taken place, the\r\nearly attention of Congress is now invited to the enactment of some\r\nexpress and detailed provisions in relation to the various claims made\r\nfor the past, and to the compensation and allowances deemed proper for\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nIt is further respectfully recommended that, such being the\r\ninconvenience of attention to these duties by the Chief Magistrate, and\r\nsuch the great pressure of business on the Treasury Department, the\r\ngeneral supervision of the coast survey and the completion of the\r\nweights and measures, if the works are kept united, should be devolved\r\non a board of officers organized specially for that purpose, or on the\r\nNavy Board attached to the Navy Department.\r\n\r\nAll my experience and reflection confirm the conviction I have so often\r\nexpressed to Congress in favor of an amendment of the Constitution\r\nwhich will prevent in any event the election of the President and Vice\r\nPresident of the United States devolving on the House of\r\nRepresentatives and the Senate, and I therefore beg leave again to\r\nsolicit your attention to the subject. There were various other\r\nsuggestions in my last annual message not acted upon, particularly that\r\nrelating to the want of uniformity in the laws of the District of\r\nColumbia, that are deemed worthy of your favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding this paper I think it due to the various Executive\r\nDepartments to bear testimony to their prosperous condition and to the\r\nability and integrity with which they have been conducted. It has been\r\nmy aim to enforce in all of them a vigilant and faithful discharge of\r\nthe public business, and it is gratifying to me to believe that there\r\nis no just cause of complaint from any quarter at the manner in which\r\nthey have fulfilled the objects of their creation.\r\n\r\nHaving now finished the observations deemed proper on this the last\r\noccasion I shall have of communicating with the two Houses of Congress\r\nat their meeting, I can not omit an expression of the gratitude which\r\nis due to the great body of my fellow citizens, in whose partiality and\r\nindulgence I have found encouragement and support in the many difficult\r\nand trying scenes through which it has been my lot to pass during my\r\npublic career. Though deeply sensible that my exertions have not been\r\ncrowned with a success corresponding to the degree of favor bestowed\r\nupon me, I am sure that they will be considered as having been directed\r\nby an earnest desire to promote the good of my country, and I am\r\nconsoled by the persuasion that what ever errors have been committed\r\nwill find a corrective in the intelligence and patriotism of those who\r\nwill succeed us. All that has occurred during my Administration is\r\ncalculated to inspire me with increased confidence in the stability of\r\nour institutions; and should I be spared to enter upon that retirement\r\nwhich is so suitable to my age and infirm health and so much desired by\r\nme in other respects, I shall not cease to invoke that beneficent Being\r\nto whose providence we are already so signally indebted for the\r\ncontinuance of His blessings on our beloved country.",
