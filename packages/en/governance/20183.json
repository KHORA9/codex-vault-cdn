In that\r\ntime sundry inaccuracies have been called to my attention, and have\r\nbeen corrected, and it may be fairly hoped that after the lapse of so\r\nlong a period all errors in matters of fact have been eliminated. I am\r\nnot aware that any fresh material has been made public, or that any\r\nnew views have been presented which would properly lead to alterations\r\nin the substance of what is herein said. If I were now writing the\r\nbook for the first time, I should do what so many of the later\r\ncontributors to the series have very wisely and advantageously done: I\r\nshould demand more space. But this was the first volume published, and\r\nat a time when the enterprise was still an experiment insistence upon\r\nsuch a point, especially on the part of the editor, would have been\r\nunreasonable. Thus it happens that, though Mr. Adams was appointed\r\nminister resident at the Hague in 1794, and thereafter continued in\r\npublic life, almost without interruption, until his death in        (p. vi)\r\nFebruary, 1848, the narrative of his career is compressed within\r\nlittle more than three hundred pages. The proper function of a work\r\nupon this scale is to draw a picture of the man.\r\n\r\nWith the picture which I have drawn of Mr. Adams, I still remain\r\nmoderately contented--by which remark I mean nothing more egotistical\r\nthan that I believe it to be a correct picture, and done with whatever\r\nmeasure of skill I may happen to possess in portraiture. I should like\r\nto change it only in one particular, viz.: by infusing throughout the\r\nvolume somewhat more of admiration. Adams has never received the\r\npraise which was his due, and probably he never will receive it. In\r\norder that justice should be done him by the public, his biographer\r\nought to speak somewhat better of him than his real deserts would\r\nrequire. He presents one of those cases where exaggeration is the\r\nservant of truth; for this moderate excess of appreciation would only\r\noffset that discount from an accurate estimate which his personal\r\nunpopularity always has caused, and probably always will cause, to be\r\nmade. He was a good instance of the rule that the world will for the\r\nmost part treat the individual as the individual treats the world.\r\nAdams was censorious, not to say uncharitable in the extreme,      (p. vii)\r\nalways in an attitude of antagonism, always unsparing and denunciatory.\r\nThe measure which he meted has been by others in their turn meted to\r\nhim. This habit of ungracious criticism was his great fault; perhaps\r\nit was almost his only very serious fault; it cost him dear in his\r\nlife, and has continued to cost his memory dear since his death.\r\nSometimes we are not sorry to see men get the punishments which they\r\nhave brought on themselves; yet we ought to be sorry for Mr. Adams.\r\nAfter all, his fault-finding was in part the result of his respect for\r\nvirtue and his hatred of all that was ignoble and unworthy. If he\r\ndespised a low standard, at least he held his own standard high, and\r\nhimself lived by the rules by which he measured others. Men with\r\nvastly greater defects have been much more kindly served both by\r\ncontemporaries and by posterity. There can be no question that Adams\r\ndeserved all the esteem which ought to be accorded to the highest\r\nmoral qualities, to very high, if a little short of the highest,\r\nintellectual endowment, and to immense acquirements. His political\r\nintegrity was of a grade rarely seen; and, in unison with his\r\nextraordinary courage and independence, it seemed to the average\r\npolitician actually irritating and offensive. He was in the same\r\ndifficulty in which Aristides the Just found himself. But neither (p. viii)\r\nassaults nor political solitude daunted or discouraged him. His career\r\nin the House of Representatives is a tale which has not a rival in\r\ncongressional history. I regret that it could not be told here at\r\ngreater length. Stubbornly fighting for freedom of speech and against\r\nthe slaveholders, fierce and unwearied in old age, falling literally\r\nout of the midst of the conflict into his grave, Mr. Adams, during the\r\nclosing years of his life, is one of the most striking figures of\r\nmodern times. I beg the reader of this volume to put into its pages\r\nmore warmth of praise than he will find therein, and so do a more\r\ncorrect justice to an honest statesman and a gallant friend of the\r\noppressed. Doing this, he will improve my book in the particular\r\nwherein I think that it chiefly needs improvement.\r\n                                                  JOHN T.

Two\r\nstreams of as good blood as flowed in the colony mingled in the veins\r\nof the infant. If heredity counts for anything he began life with an\r\nexcellent chance of becoming famous--_non sine dîs animosus infans_.\r\nHe was called after his great-grandfather on the mother's side, John\r\nQuincy, a man of local note who had borne in his day a distinguished\r\npart in provincial affairs. Such a naming was a simple and natural\r\noccurrence enough, but Mr. Adams afterward moralized upon it in his\r\ncharacteristic way:--\r\n\r\n     \"The incident which gave rise to this circumstance is not without\r\n     its moral to my heart. He was dying when I was baptized; and his\r\n     daughter, my grandmother, present at my birth, requested that I\r\n     might receive his name. The fact, recorded by my father at    (p. 002)\r\n     the time, has connected with that portion of my name a charm\r\n     of mingled sensibility and devotion. It was filial tenderness\r\n     that gave the name. It was the name of one passing from earth to\r\n     immortality. These have been among the strongest links of my\r\n     attachment to the name of Quincy, and have been to me through\r\n     life a perpetual admonition to do nothing unworthy of it.\"\r\n\r\nFate, which had made such good preparation for him before his birth, was\r\nnot less kind in arranging the circumstances of his early training and\r\ndevelopment. His father was deeply engaged in the patriot cause, and\r\nthe first matters borne in upon his opening intelligence concerned the\r\npublic discontent and resistance to tyranny. He was but seven years\r\nold when he clambered with his mother to the top of one of the high\r\nhills in the neighborhood of his home to listen to the sounds of conflict\r\nupon Bunker's Hill, and to watch the flaming ruin of Charlestown.\r\nProfound was the impression made upon him by the spectacle, and it was\r\nintensified by many an hour spent afterward upon the same spot during\r\nthe siege and bombardment of Boston. Then John Adams went as a\r\ndelegate to the Continental Congress at Philadelphia, and his wife and\r\nchildren were left for twelve months, as John Quincy Adams says,--it\r\nis to be hoped with a little exaggeration of the barbarity of      (p. 003)\r\nBritish troops toward women and babes,--\"liable every hour of the day\r\nand of the night to be butchered in cold blood, or taken and carried\r\ninto Boston as hostages, by any foraging or marauding detachment.\"\r\nLater, when the British had evacuated Boston, the boy, barely nine\r\nyears old, became \"post-rider\" between the city and the farm, a\r\ndistance of eleven miles each way, in order to bring all the latest\r\nnews to his mother.\r\n\r\nNot much regular schooling was to be got amid such surroundings of\r\ntimes and events, but the lad had a natural aptitude or affinity for\r\nknowledge which stood him in better stead than could any dame of a\r\nvillage school. The following letter to his father is worth\r\npreserving:--\r\n\r\n                                   BRAINTREE, _June the 2d, 1777_.\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR,--I love to receive letters very well, much better than\r\n     I love to write them. I make but a poor figure at composition, my\r\n     head is much too fickle, my thoughts are running after birds'\r\n     eggs, play and trifles till I get vexed with myself. I have but\r\n     just entered the 3d volume of Smollett, tho' I had designed to\r\n     have got it half through by this time. I have determined this\r\n     week to be more diligent, as Mr. Thaxter will be absent at Court\r\n     and I Cannot pursue my other Studies. I have Set myself a Stent\r\n     and determine to read the 3d volume Half out. If I can but    (p. 004)\r\n     keep my resolution I will write again at the end of the week\r\n     and give a better account of myself. I wish, Sir, you would give\r\n     me some instructions with regard to my time, and advise me how to\r\n     proportion my Studies and my Play, in writing, and I will keep\r\n     them by me and endeavor to follow them. I am, dear Sir, with a\r\n     present determination of growing better. Yours.\r\n\r\n     P.S. Sir, if you will be so good as to favor me with a Blank\r\n     book, I will transcribe the most remarkable occurrences I met\r\n     with in my reading, which will serve to fix them upon my mind.\r\n\r\nNot long after the writing of this model epistle, the simple village\r\nlife was interrupted by an unexpected change. John Adams was sent on a\r\ndiplomatic journey to Paris, and on February 13, 1778, embarked in the\r\nfrigate Boston. John Quincy Adams, then eleven years old, accompanied\r\nhis father and thus made his first acquaintance with the foreign lands\r\nwhere so many of his coming years were to be passed. This initial\r\nvisit, however, was brief; and he was hardly well established at\r\nschool when events caused his father to start for home. Unfortunately\r\nthis return trip was a needless loss of time, since within three\r\nmonths of their setting foot upon American shores the two travellers\r\nwere again on their stormy way back across the Atlantic in a leaky\r\nship, which had to land them at the nearest port in Spain. One     (p. 005)\r\nmore quotation must be given from a letter written just after the\r\nfirst arrival in France:--\r\n\r\n                                   PASSY, _September the 27th, 1778_.\r\n\r\n     HONORED MAMMA,--My Pappa enjoins it upon me to keep a Journal, or\r\n     a Diary of the Events that happen to me, and of objects that I\r\n     see, and of Characters that I converse with from day to day; and\r\n     altho' I am Convinced of the utility, importance and necessity of\r\n     this Exercise, yet I have not patience and perseverance enough to\r\n     do it so Constantly as I ought. My Pappa, who takes a great deal\r\n     of pains to put me in the right way, has also advised me to\r\n     Preserve Copies of all my letters, and has given me a Convenient\r\n     Blank Book for this end; and altho' I shall have the\r\n     mortification a few years hence to read a great deal of my\r\n     Childish nonsense, yet I shall have the Pleasure and advantage of\r\n     Remarking the several steps by which I shall have advanced in\r\n     taste, judgment and knowledge. A Journal Book and a letter Book\r\n     of a Lad of Eleven years old Can not be expected to Contain much\r\n     of Science, Literature, arts, wisdom, or wit, yet it may serve to\r\n     perpetuate many observations that I may make, and may hereafter\r\n     help me to recollect both persons and things that would other\r\n     ways escape my memory.\r\n\r\nHe continues with resolutions \"to be more thoughtful and industrious\r\nfor the future,\" and reflects with pleasure upon the prospect that\r\nhis scheme \"will be a sure means of improvement to myself, and     (p. 006)\r\nenable me to be more entertaining to you.\" What gratification must\r\nthis letter from one who was quite justified in signing himself her\r\n\"dutiful and affectionate son\" have brought to the Puritan bosom of\r\nthe good mother at home! If the plan for the diary was not pursued\r\nduring the first short flitting abroad, it can hardly be laid at the\r\ndoor of the \"lad of eleven years\" as a serious fault. He did in fact\r\nbegin it when setting out on the aforementioned second trip to Europe,\r\ncalling it\r\n\r\n                         A JOURNAL BY J. Q. A.,\r\n\r\n                       _From America to Spain._\r\n\r\n                               Vol. I.\r\n\r\n                  Begun Friday, 12 of November, 1779.\r\n\r\nThe spark of life in the great undertaking flickered in a somewhat\r\nfeeble and irregular way for many years thereafter, but apparently\r\ngained strength by degrees until in 1795, as Mr. C. F. Adams tells us,\r\n\"what may be denominated the diary proper begins,\" a very vigorous\r\nwork in more senses than one. Continued with astonishing persistency\r\nand faithfulness until within a few days of the writer's death, the\r\nlatest entry is of the 4th of January, 1848. Mr. Adams achieved many\r\nsuccesses during his life as the result of conscious effort, but   (p. 007)\r\nthe greatest success of all he achieved altogether unconsciously. He\r\nleft a portrait of himself more full, correct, vivid, and picturesque\r\nthan has ever been bequeathed to posterity by any other personage of\r\nthe past ages. Any mistakes which may be made in estimating his mental\r\nor moral attributes must be charged to the dulness or prejudice of the\r\njudge, who could certainly not ask for better or more abundant\r\nevidence. Few of us know our most intimate friends better than any of\r\nus may know Mr. Adams, if we will but take the trouble. Even the brief\r\nextracts already given from his correspondence show us the boy; it\r\nonly concerns us to get them into the proper light for seeing them\r\naccurately. If a lad of seven, nine, or eleven years of age should\r\nwrite such solemn little effusions amid the surroundings and\r\ninfluences of the present day, he would probably be set down justly\r\nenough as either an offensive young prig or a prematurely developed\r\nhypocrite. But the precocious Adams had only a little of the prig and\r\nnothing of the hypocrite in his nature. Being the outcome of many\r\ngenerations of simple, devout, intelligent Puritan ancestors, living\r\nin a community which loved virtue and sought knowledge, all inherited\r\nand all present influences combined to make him, as it may be put  (p. 008)\r\nin a single word, sensible. He had inevitably a mental boyhood and\r\nyouth, but morally he was never either a child or a lad; all his\r\nleading traits of character were as strongly marked when he was seven\r\nas when he was seventy, and at an age when most young people simply\r\nwin love or cause annoyance, he was preferring wisdom to mischief, and\r\nactually in his earliest years was attracting a certain respect.\r\n\r\nThese few but bold and striking touches which paint the boy are\r\nchanged for an infinitely more elaborate and complex presentation from\r\nthe time when the Diary begins. Even as abridged in the printing, this\r\nimmense work ranks among the half-dozen longest diaries to be found in\r\nany library, and it is unquestionably by far the most valuable.\r\nHenceforth we are to travel along its broad route to the end; we shall\r\nsee in it both the great and the small among public men halting onward\r\nin a way very different from that in which they march along the\r\nstately pages of the historian, and we shall find many side-lights, by\r\nno means colorless, thrown upon the persons and events of the\r\nprocession. The persistence, fulness, and faithfulness with which it\r\nwas kept throughout so busy a life are marvellous, but are also highly\r\ncharacteristic of the most persevering and industrious of men.     (p. 009)\r\nThat it has been preserved is cause not only for thankfulness but\r\nfor some surprise also. For if its contents had been known, it is\r\ncertain that all the public men of nearly two generations who figure\r\nin it would have combined into one vast and irresistible conspiracy to\r\nobtain and destroy it. There was always a superfluity of gall in the\r\ndiarist's ink. Sooner or later every man of any note in the United\r\nStates was mentioned in his pages, and there is scarcely one of them,\r\nwho, if he could have read what was said of him, would not have\r\npreferred the ignominy of omission. As one turns the leaves he feels\r\nas though he were walking through a graveyard of slaughtered\r\nreputations wherein not many headstones show a few words of measured\r\ncommendation. It is only the greatness and goodness of Mr. Adams\r\nhimself which relieve the universal atmosphere of sadness far more\r\ndepressing than the melancholy which pervades the novels of George\r\nEliot. The reader who wishes to retain any comfortable degree of\r\nbelief in his fellow men will turn to the wall all the portraits in\r\nthe gallery except only the inimitable one of the writer himself. For\r\nit would be altogether too discouraging to think that so wide an\r\nexperience of men as Mr. Adams enjoyed through his long, varied, and\r\nactive life must lead to such an unpleasant array of human faces   (p. 010)\r\nas those which are scattered along these twelve big octavos.\r\nFortunately at present we have to do with only one of these\r\nlikenesses, and that one we are able to admire while knowing also that\r\nit is beyond question accurate. One after another every trait of Mr.\r\nAdams comes out; we shall see that he was a man of a very high and\r\nnoble character veined with some very notable and disagreeable\r\nblemishes; his aspirations were honorable, even the lowest of them\r\nbeing more than simply respectable; he had an avowed ambition, but it\r\nwas of that pure kind which led him to render true and distinguished\r\nservices to his countrymen; he was not only a zealous patriot, but a\r\nprofound believer in the sound and practicable tenets of the liberal\r\npolitical creed of the United States; he had one of the most honest\r\nand independent natures that was ever given to man; personal integrity\r\nof course goes without saying, but he had the rarer gift of an\r\nelevated and rigid political honesty such as has been unfrequently\r\nseen in any age or any nation; in times of severe trial this quality\r\nwas even cruelly tested, but we shall never see it fail; he was as\r\ncourageous as if he had been a fanatic; indeed, for a long part of his\r\nlife to maintain a single-handed fight in support of a despised or\r\nunpopular opinion seemed his natural function and almost exclusive\r\ncalling; he was thoroughly conscientious and never knowingly did   (p. 011)\r\nwrong, nor even sought to persuade himself that wrong was right;\r\nwell read in literature and of wide and varied information in nearly\r\nall matters of knowledge, he was more especially remarkable for his\r\nacquirements in the domain of politics, where indeed they were vast\r\nand ever growing; he had a clear and generally a cool head, and was\r\nnearly always able to do full justice to himself and to his cause; he\r\nhad an indomitable will, unconquerable persistence, and infinite\r\nlaboriousness. Such were the qualities which made him a great\r\nstatesman; but unfortunately we must behold a hardly less striking\r\nreverse to the picture, in the faults and shortcomings which made him\r\nso unpopular in his lifetime that posterity is only just beginning to\r\nforget the prejudices of his contemporaries and to render concerning\r\nhim the judgment which he deserves. Never did a man of pure life and\r\njust purposes have fewer friends or more enemies than John Quincy\r\nAdams. His nature, said to have been very affectionate in his family\r\nrelations, was in its aspect outside of that small circle singularly\r\ncold and repellent. If he could ever have gathered even a small\r\npersonal following his character and abilities would have insured him\r\na brilliant and prolonged success; but, for a man of his calibre   (p. 012)\r\nand influence, we shall see him as one of the most lonely and desolate\r\nof the great men of history; instinct led the public men of his time\r\nto range themselves against him rather than with him, and we shall\r\nfind them fighting beside him only when irresistibly compelled to do\r\nso by policy or strong convictions. As he had little sympathy with\r\nthose with whom he was brought in contact, so he was very uncharitable\r\nin his judgment of them; and thus having really a low opinion of so\r\nmany of them he could indulge his vindictive rancor without stint; his\r\ninvective, always powerful, will sometimes startle us by its venom,\r\nand we shall be pained to see him apt to make enemies for a good cause\r\nby making them for himself.\r\n\r\nThis has been, perhaps, too long a lingering upon the threshold. But\r\nMr. Adams's career in public life stretched over so long a period that\r\nto write a full historical memoir of him within the limited space of\r\nthis volume is impossible. All that can be attempted is to present a\r\nsketch of the man with a few of his more prominent surroundings\r\nagainst a very meagre and insufficient background of the history of\r\nthe times. So it may be permissible to begin with a general outline of\r\nhis figure, to be filled in, shaded, and colored as we proceed. At\r\nbest our task is much more difficult of satisfactory achievement   (p. 013)\r\nthan an historical biography of the customary elaborate order.\r\n\r\nDuring his second visit to Europe, our mature youngster--if the word\r\nmay be used of Mr. Adams even in his earliest years--began to see a\r\ngood deal of the world and to mingle in very distinguished society.\r\nFor a brief period he got a little schooling, first at Paris, next at\r\nAmsterdam, and then at Leyden; altogether the amount was\r\ninsignificant, since he was not quite fourteen years old when he\r\nactually found himself engaged in a diplomatic career. Francis Dana,\r\nafterward Chief Justice of Massachusetts, was then accredited as an\r\nenvoy to Russia from the United States, and he took Mr. Adams with him\r\nas his private secretary. Not much came of the mission, but it was a\r\nvaluable experience for a lad of his years. Upon his return he spent\r\nsix months in travel and then he rejoined his father in Paris, where\r\nthat gentleman was engaged with Franklin and John Jay in negotiating\r\nthe final treaty of peace between the revolted colonies and the mother\r\ncountry. The boy \"was at once enlisted in the service as an additional\r\nsecretary, and gave his help to the preparation of the papers\r\nnecessary to the completion of that instrument which dispersed all\r\npossible doubt of the Independence of his Country.\"\r\n\r\nOn April 26, 1785, arrived the packet-ship Le Courier de L'Orient, (p. 014)\r\nbringing a letter from Mr. Gerry containing news of the appointment of\r\nJohn Adams as Minister to St. James's. This unforeseen occurrence made\r\nit necessary for the younger Adams to determine his own career, which\r\napparently he was left to do for himself. He was indeed a singular\r\nyoung man, not unworthy of such confidence! The glimpses which we get\r\nof him during this stay abroad show him as the associate upon terms of\r\nequality with grown men of marked ability and exercising important\r\nfunctions. He preferred diplomacy to dissipation, statesmen to\r\nmistresses, and in the midst of all the temptations of the gayest\r\ncapital in the world, the chariness with which he sprinkled his wild\r\noats amid the alluring gardens chiefly devoted to the culture of those\r\ncereals might well have brought a blush to the cheeks of some among\r\nhis elders, at least if the tongue of slander wags not with gross\r\nuntruth concerning the colleagues of John Adams. But he was not in\r\nEurope to amuse himself, though at an age when amusement is natural\r\nand a tinge of sinfulness is so often pardoned; he was there with the\r\ndefinite and persistent purpose of steady improvement and acquisition.\r\nAt his age most young men play the cards which a kind fortune puts\r\ninto their hands, with the reckless intent only of immediate gain, (p. 015)\r\nbut from the earliest moment when he began the game of life Adams\r\ncoolly and wisely husbanded every card which came into his hand, with\r\na steady view to probable future contingencies, and with the resolve\r\nto win in the long run. So now the resolution which he took in the\r\npresent question illustrated the clearness of his mind and the\r\nstrength of his character. To go with his father to England would be\r\nto enjoy a life precisely fitted to his natural and acquired tastes,\r\nto mingle with the men who were making history, to be cognizant of the\r\nweightiest of public affairs, to profit by all that the grandest city\r\nin the world had to show. It was easy to be not only allured by the\r\nprospect but also to be deceived by its apparent advantages. Adams,\r\nhowever, had the sense and courage to turn his back on it, and to go\r\nhome to the meagre shores and small society of New England, there to\r\nbecome a boy again, to enter Harvard College, and come under all its\r\nat that time rigid and petty regulations. It almost seems a mistake,\r\nbut it was not. Already he was too ripe and too wise to blunder. He\r\nhimself gives us his characteristic and sufficient reasons:--\r\n\r\n     \"Were I now to go with my father probably my immediate\r\n     satisfaction might be greater than it will be in returning    (p. 016)\r\n     to America. After having been travelling for these seven years\r\n     almost and all over Europe, and having been in the world and among\r\n     company for three; to return to spend one or two years in the\r\n     pale of a college, subjected to all the rules which I have so long\r\n     been freed from; and afterwards not expect (however good an opinion\r\n     I may have of myself) to bring myself into notice under three or\r\n     four years more, if ever! It is really a prospect somewhat\r\n     discouraging for a youth of my ambition, (for I have ambition\r\n     though I hope its object is laudable). But still\r\n\r\n                    'Oh! how wretched\r\n          Is that poor man, that hangs on Princes' favors,'\r\n\r\n     or on those of any body else. I am determined that so long as I\r\n     shall be able to get my own living in an honorable manner, I will\r\n     depend upon no one. My father has been so much taken up all his\r\n     lifetime with the interests of the public, that his own fortune\r\n     has suffered by it: so that his children will have to provide for\r\n     themselves, which I shall never be able to do if I loiter away my\r\n     precious time in Europe and shun going home until I am forced to\r\n     it. With an ordinary share of common sense, which I hope I enjoy,\r\n     at least in America I can live _independent_ and _free_; and\r\n     rather than live otherwise I would wish to die before the time\r\n     when I shall be left at my own discretion. I have before me a\r\n     striking example of the distressing and humiliating situation a\r\n     person is reduced to by adopting a different line of conduct, and\r\n     I am determined not to fall into the same error.\"\r\n\r\nIt is needless to comment upon such spirit and sense, or upon      (p. 017)\r\nsuch just appreciation of what was feasible, wise, and right for him,\r\nas a New Englander whose surroundings and prospects were widely\r\ndifferent from those of the society about him. He must have been\r\nstrongly imbued by nature with the instincts of his birthplace to\r\nhave formed, after a seven years' absence at his impressible age, so\r\ncorrect a judgment of the necessities and possibilities of his own\r\ncareer in relationship to the people and ideas of his own country.\r\n\r\nHome accordingly he came, and by assiduity prepared himself in a very\r\nshort time to enter the junior class at Harvard College, whence he was\r\ngraduated in high standing in 1787. From there he went to Newburyport,\r\nthen a thriving and active seaport enriched by the noble trade of\r\nprivateering in addition to more regular maritime business, and entered\r\nas a law student the office of Theophilus Parsons, afterwards the\r\nChief Justice of Massachusetts. On July 15, 1790, being twenty-three\r\nyears old, he was admitted to practice. Immediately afterward he\r\nestablished himself in Boston, where for a time he felt strangely\r\nsolitary. Clients of course did not besiege his doors in the first\r\nyear, and he appears to have waited rather stubbornly than cheerfully\r\nfor more active days. These came in good time, and during the      (p. 018)\r\nsecond, third, and fourth years, his business grew apace to encouraging\r\ndimensions.\r\n\r\nHe was, however, doing other work than that of the law, and much more\r\nimportant in its bearing upon his future career. He could not keep his\r\nthoughts, nor indeed his hands, from public affairs. When, in 1791,\r\nThomas Paine produced the \"Rights of Man,\" Thomas Jefferson acting as\r\nmidwife to usher the bantling before the people of the United States,\r\nAdams's indignation was fired, and he published anonymously a series\r\nof refuting papers over the signature of Publicola. These attracted\r\nmuch attention, not only at home but also abroad, and were by many\r\nattributed to John Adams. Two years later, during the excitement\r\naroused by the reception and subsequent outrageous behavior here of\r\nthe French minister, Genet, Mr. Adams again published in the Boston\r\n\"Centinel\" some papers over the signature of Marcellus, discussing\r\nwith much ability the then new and perplexing question of the\r\nneutrality which should be observed by this country in European wars.\r\nThese were followed by more, over the signature of Columbus, and\r\nafterward by still more in the name of Barnevelt, all strongly\r\nreprobating the course of the crazy-headed foreigner. The writer was\r\nnot permitted to remain long unknown. It is not certain, but it    (p. 019)\r\nis highly probable, that to these articles was due the nomination\r\nwhich Mr. Adams received shortly afterward from President Washington,\r\nas Minister Resident at the Hague. This nomination was sent in to the\r\nSenate, May 29, 1794, and was unanimously confirmed on the following\r\nday. It may be imagined that the change from the moderate practice of\r\nhis Boston law office to a European court, of which he so well knew\r\nthe charms, was not distasteful to him. There are passages in his\r\nDiary which indicate that he had been chafing with irrepressible\r\nimpatience \"in that state of useless and disgraceful insignificancy,\"\r\nto which, as it seemed to him, he was relegated, so that at the age of\r\ntwenty-five, when \"many of the characters who were born for the\r\nbenefit of their fellow creatures, have rendered themselves conspicuous\r\namong their contemporaries, ... I still find myself as obscure, as\r\nunknown to the world, as the most indolent or the most stupid of human\r\nbeings.\" Entertaining such a restless ambition, he of course accepted\r\nthe proffered office, though not without some expression of unexplained\r\ndoubt. October 31, 1794, found him at the Hague, after a voyage of\r\nconsiderable peril in a leaky ship, commanded by a blundering captain.\r\nHe was a young diplomat, indeed; it was on his twenty-seventh      (p. 020)\r\nbirthday that he received his commission.\r\n\r\nThe minister made his advent upon a tumultuous scene. All Europe was\r\ngetting under arms in the long and desperate struggle with France.\r\nScarcely had he presented his credentials to the Stadtholder ere that\r\ndignitary was obliged to flee before the conquering standards of the\r\nFrench. Pichegru marched into the capital city of the Low Countries,\r\nhung out the tri-color, and established the \"Batavian Republic\" as the\r\nally of France. The diplomatic representatives of most of the European\r\npowers forthwith left, and Mr. Adams was strongly moved to do the same,\r\nthough for reasons different from those which actuated his compeers.\r\nHe was not, like them, placed in an unpleasant position by the new\r\ncondition of affairs, but on the contrary he was very cordially\r\ntreated by the French and their Dutch partisans, and was obliged to\r\nfall back upon his native prudence to resist their compromising\r\novertures and dangerous friendship. Without giving offence he yet kept\r\nclear of entanglements, and showed a degree of wisdom and skill which\r\nmany older and more experienced Americans failed to evince, either\r\nabroad or at home, during these exciting years. But he appeared to be\r\nleft without occupation in the altered condition of affairs, and   (p. 021)\r\ntherefore was considering the propriety of returning, when advices\r\nfrom home induced him to stay. Washington especially wrote that he\r\nmust not think of retiring, and prophesied that he would soon be\r\n\"found at the head of the diplomatic corps, be the government\r\nadministered by whomsoever the people may choose.\" He remained,\r\ntherefore, at the Hague, a shrewd and close observer of the exciting\r\nevents occurring around him, industriously pursuing an extensive\r\ncourse of study and reading, making useful acquaintances, acquiring\r\nfamiliarity with foreign languages, with the usages of diplomacy and\r\nthe habits of distinguished society. He had little public business to\r\ntransact, it is true; but at least his time was well spent for his own\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nAn episode in his life at the Hague was his visit to England, where he\r\nwas directed to exchange ratifications of the treaty lately negotiated\r\nby Mr. Jay. But a series of vexatious delays, apparently maliciously\r\ncontrived, detained him so long that upon his arrival he found this\r\nspecific task already accomplished by Mr. Deas. He was probably not\r\ndisappointed that his name thus escaped connection with engagements so\r\nodious to a large part of the nation. He had, however, some further\r\nbusiness of an informal character to transact with Lord Grenville, (p. 022)\r\nand in endeavoring to conduct it found himself rather awkwardly placed.\r\nHe was not minister to the Court of St. James, having been only\r\nvaguely authorized to discuss certain arrangements in a tentative way,\r\nwithout the power to enter into any definitive agreement. But the\r\nEnglish Cabinet strongly disliking Mr. Deas, who in the absence of Mr.\r\nPinckney represented for the time the United States, and much\r\npreferring to negotiate with Mr. Adams, sought by many indirect and\r\nartful subterfuges to thrust upon him the character of a regularly\r\naccredited minister. He had much ado to avoid, without offence, the\r\nassumption of functions to which he had no title, but which were with\r\ndesigning courtesy forced upon him. His cool and moderate temper,\r\nhowever, carried him successfully through the whole business, alike in\r\nits social and its diplomatic aspect.\r\n\r\nAnother negotiation, of a private nature also, he brought to a\r\nsuccessful issue during these few months in London. He made the\r\nacquaintance of Miss Louisa Catherine Johnson, daughter of Joshua\r\nJohnson, then American Consul at London, and niece of that Governor\r\nJohnson, of Maryland, who had signed the Declaration of Independence\r\nand was afterwards placed on the bench of the Supreme Court of     (p. 023)\r\nthe United States. To this lady he became engaged; and returning\r\nnot long afterward he was married to her on July 26, 1797. It was a\r\nthoroughly happy and, for him, a life-long union.\r\n\r\nPresident Washington, toward the close of his second term, transferred\r\nMr. Adams to the Court of Portugal. But before his departure thither\r\nhis destination was changed. Some degree of embarrassment was felt\r\nabout this time concerning his further continuance in public office,\r\nby reason of his father's accession to the Presidency. He wrote to his\r\nmother a manly and spirited letter, rebuking her for carelessly\r\ndropping an expression indicative of a fear that he might look for\r\nsome favor at his father's hands. He could neither solicit nor expect\r\nanything, he justly said, and he was pained that his mother should not\r\nknow him better than to entertain any apprehension of his feeling\r\notherwise. It was a perplexing position in which the two were placed.\r\nIt would be a great hardship to cut short the son's career because of\r\nthe success of the father, yet the reproach of nepotism could not be\r\nlightly encountered, even with the backing of clear consciences.\r\nWashington came kindly to the aid of his doubting successor, and in a\r\nletter highly complimentary to Mr. John Quincy Adams strongly urged\r\nthat well-merited promotion ought not to be kept from him,         (p. 024)\r\nforetelling for him a distinguished future in the diplomatic service.\r\nThese representations prevailed; and the President's only action as\r\nconcerned his son consisted in changing his destination from Portugal\r\nto Prussia, both missions being at that time of the same grade, though\r\nthat to Prussia was then established for the first time by the making\r\nand confirming of this nomination.\r\n\r\nTo Berlin, accordingly, Mr. Adams proceeded in November, 1797, and had\r\nthe somewhat cruel experience of being \"questioned at the gates by a\r\ndapper lieutenant, who did not know, until one of his private soldiers\r\nexplained to him, who the United States of America were.\" Overcoming\r\nthis unusual obstacle to a ministerial advent, and succeeding, after\r\nmany months, in getting through all the introductory formalities, he\r\nfound not much more to be done at Berlin than there had been at the\r\nHague. But such useful work as was open to him he accomplished in the\r\nshape of a treaty of amity and commerce between Prussia and the United\r\nStates. This having been duly ratified by both the powers, his further\r\nstay seemed so useless that he wrote home suggesting his readiness to\r\nreturn; and while awaiting a reply he travelled through some portions\r\nof Europe which he had not before seen. His recall was one of the  (p. 025)\r\nlast acts of his father's administration, made, says Mr. Seward,\r\n\"that Mr. Jefferson might have no embarrassment in that direction,\"\r\nbut quite as probably dictated by a vindictive desire to show how wide\r\nwas the gulf of animosity which had opened between the family of the\r\ndisappointed ex-President and his triumphant rival.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams, immediately upon his arrival at home, prepared to return to\r\nthe practice of his profession. It was not altogether an agreeable\r\ntransition from an embassy at the courts of Europe to a law office in\r\nBoston, with the necessity of furbishing up long disused knowledge,\r\nand a second time patiently awaiting the influx of clients. But he\r\nfaced it with his stubborn temper and practical sense. The slender\r\npromise which he was able to discern in the political outlook could\r\nnot fail to disappoint him, since his native predilections were\r\nunquestionably and strongly in favor of a public career. During his\r\nabsence party animosities had been developing rapidly. The first great\r\nparty victory since the organization of the government had just been\r\nwon, after a very bitter struggle, by the Republicans or Democrats, as\r\nthey were then indifferently called, whose exuberant delight found its\r\nfull counterpart in the angry despondency of the Federalists. That\r\nirascible old gentleman, the elder Adams, having experienced a     (p. 026)\r\nvery Waterloo defeat in the contest for the Presidency, had ridden\r\naway from the capital, actually in a wild rage, on the night of the 3d\r\nof March, 1801, to avoid the humiliating pageant of Mr. Jefferson's\r\ninauguration. Yet far more fierce than this natural party warfare was\r\nthe internal dissension which rent the Federal party in twain. Those\r\ncracks upon the surface and subterraneous rumblings, which the\r\nexperienced observer could for some time have noted, had opened with\r\nterrible uproar into a gaping chasm, when John Adams, still in the\r\nPresidency, suddenly announced his determination to send a mission to\r\nFrance at a crisis when nearly all his party were looking for war.\r\nPerhaps this step was, as his admirers claim, an act of pure and\r\ndisinterested statesmanship. Certainly its result was fortunate for\r\nthe country at large. But for John Adams it was ruinous. At the moment\r\nwhen he made the bold move, he doubtless expected to be followed by\r\nhis party. Extreme was his disappointment and boundless his wrath,\r\nwhen he found that he had at his back only a fraction, not improbably\r\nless than half, of that party. He learned with infinite chagrin that\r\nhe had only a divided empire with a private individual; that it was\r\nnot safe for him, the President of the United States, to originate\r\nany important measure without first consulting a lawyer quietly    (p. 027)\r\nengaged in the practice of his profession in New York; that, in short,\r\nat least a moiety, in which were to be found the most intelligent\r\nmembers, of the great Federal party, when in search of guidance,\r\nturned their faces toward Alexander Hamilton rather than toward John\r\nAdams. These Hamiltonians by no means relished the French mission, so\r\nthat from this time forth a schism of intense bitterness kept the\r\nFederal party asunder, and John Adams hated Alexander Hamilton with a\r\nvigor not surpassed in the annals of human antipathies. His rage was\r\nnot assuaged by the conduct of this dreaded foe in the presidential\r\ncampaign; and the defeated candidate always preferred to charge his\r\nfailure to Hamilton's machinations rather than to the real will of the\r\npeople. This, however, was unfair; it was perfectly obvious that a\r\nmajority of the nation had embraced Jeffersonian tenets, and that\r\nFederalism was moribund.\r\n\r\nTo this condition of affairs John Quincy Adams returned. Fortunately\r\nhe had been compelled to bear no part in the embroilments of the past,\r\nand his sagacity must have led him, while listening with filial\r\nsympathy to the interpretations placed upon events by his incensed\r\nparent, yet to make liberal allowance for the distorting effects   (p. 028)\r\nof the old gentleman's rage. Still it was in the main only natural for\r\nhim to regard himself as a Federalist of the Adams faction. His\r\nproclivities had always been with that party. In Massachusetts the\r\neducated and well-to-do classes were almost unanimously of that way of\r\nthinking. The select coterie of gentlemen in the State, who in those\r\ntimes bore an active and influential part in politics, were nearly all\r\nHamiltonians, but the adherents of President Adams were numerically\r\nstrong. Nor was the younger Adams himself long left without his\r\nprivate grievance against Mr. Jefferson, who promptly used the\r\nauthority vested in him by a new statute to remove Mr. Adams from the\r\nposition of commissioner in bankruptcy, to which, at the time of his\r\nresuming business, he had been appointed by the judge of the district\r\ncourt. Long afterward Jefferson sought to escape the odium of this\r\napparently malicious and, for those days, unusual action, by a very\r\nJeffersonian explanation, tolerably satisfactory to those persons who\r\nbelieved it.\r\n\r\nOn April 5, 1802, Mr. Adams was chosen by the Federalists of Boston to\r\nrepresent them in the State Senate. The office was at that time still\r\nsought by men of the best ability and position, and though it was\r\nhardly a step upward on the political ladder for one who had\r\nrepresented the nation in foreign parts for eight years, yet       (p. 029)\r\nMr. Adams was well content to accept it. At least it reopened the door\r\nof political life, and moreover one of his steadfast maxims was never\r\nto refuse any function which the people sought to impose upon him. It\r\nis worth noting, for its bearing upon controversies soon to be\r\nencountered in this narrative, that forty-eight hours had not elapsed\r\nafter Mr. Adams had taken his seat before he ventured upon a display\r\nof independence which caused much irritation to his Federalist\r\nassociates. He had the hardihood to propose that the Federalist\r\nmajority in the legislature should permit the Republican minority to\r\nenjoy a proportional representation in the council. \"It was the first\r\nact of my legislative life,\" he wrote many years afterward, \"and it\r\nmarked the principle by which my whole public life has been governed\r\nfrom that day to this. My proposal was unsuccessful, and perhaps it\r\nforfeited whatever confidence might have been otherwise bestowed upon\r\nme as a party follower.\" Indeed, all his life long Mr. Adams was never\r\nsubmissive to the party whip, but voted upon every question precisely\r\naccording to his opinion of its merits, without the slightest regard\r\nto the political company in which for the time being he might find\r\nhimself. A compeer of his in the United States Senate once said    (p. 030)\r\nof him, that he regarded every public measure which came up as he\r\nwould a proposition in Euclid, abstracted from any party considerations.\r\nThese frequent derelictions of his were at first forgiven with a\r\nmagnanimity really very creditable, so long as it lasted, especially\r\nto the Hamiltonians in the Federal party; and so liberal was this\r\nforbearance that when in February, 1803, the legislature had to elect\r\na Senator to the United States Senate, he was chosen upon the fourth\r\nballot by 86 votes out of 171. This was the more gratifying to him and\r\nthe more handsome on the part of the anti-Adams men in the party,\r\nbecause the place was eagerly sought by Timothy Pickering, an old man\r\nwho had strong claims growing out of an almost life-long and very\r\nefficient service in their ranks, and who was moreover a most stanch\r\nadherent of General Hamilton.\r\n\r\nSo in October, 1803, we find Mr. Adams on his way to Washington, the\r\nraw and unattractive village which then constituted the national\r\ncapital, wherein there was not, as the pious New Englander instantly\r\nnoted, a church of any denomination; but those who were religiously\r\ndisposed were obliged to attend services \"usually performed on Sundays\r\nat the Treasury Office and at the Capitol.\" With what anticipations\r\nMr. Adams's mind was filled during his journey to this embryotic   (p. 031)\r\ncity his Diary does not tell; but if they were in any degree cheerful\r\nor sanguine they were destined to cruel disappointment. He was now\r\nprobably to appreciate for the first time the fierce vigor of the\r\nhostility which his father had excited. In Massachusetts social\r\nconnections and friendships probably mitigated the open display of\r\nrancor to which in Washington full sway was given. It was not only the\r\nRepublican majority who showed feelings which in them were at least\r\nfair if they were strong, but the Federal minority were maliciously\r\npleased to find in the son of the ill-starred John Adams a victim on\r\nwhom to vent that spleen and abuse which were so provokingly\r\nineffective against the solid working majority of their opponents in\r\nCongress. The Republicans trampled upon the Federalists, and the\r\nFederalists trampled on John Quincy Adams. He spoke seldom, and\r\ncertainly did not weary the Senators, yet whenever he rose to his feet\r\nhe was sure of a cold, too often almost an insulting, reception. By no\r\nchance or possibility could anything which he said or suggested please\r\nhis prejudiced auditors. The worst augury for any measure was his\r\nsupport; any motion which he made was sure to be voted down, though\r\nnot unfrequently substantially the same matter being afterward moved\r\nby somebody else would be readily carried. That cordiality,        (p. 032)\r\nassistance, and sense of fellowship which Senators from the same State\r\ncustomarily expect and obtain from each other could not be enjoyed by\r\nhim. For shortly after his arrival in Washington, Mr. Pickering had\r\nbeen chosen to fill a vacancy in the other Massachusetts senatorship,\r\nand appeared upon the scene as a most unwelcome colleague. For a time,\r\nindeed, an outward semblance of political comradeship was maintained\r\nbetween them, but it would have been folly for an Adams to put faith\r\nin a Pickering, and perhaps _vice versa_. This position of his, as the\r\nunpopular member of an unpopular minority, could not be misunderstood,\r\nand many allusions to it occur in his Diary. One day he notes a motion\r\nrejected; another day, that he has \"nothing to do but to make\r\nfruitless opposition;\" he constantly recites that he has voted with a\r\nsmall minority, and at least once he himself composed the whole of\r\nthat minority; soon after his arrival he says that an amendment\r\nproposed by him \"will certainly not pass; and, indeed, I have already\r\nseen enough to ascertain that no amendments of my proposing will\r\nobtain in the Senate as now filled;\" again, \"I presented my three\r\nresolutions, which raised a storm as violent as I expected;\" and on\r\nthe same day he writes, \"I have no doubt of incurring much censure\r\nand obloquy for this measure;\" a day or two later he speaks of     (p. 033)\r\ncertain persons \"who hate me rather more than they love any\r\nprinciple;\" when he expressed an opinion in favor of ratifying a\r\ntreaty with the Creeks, he remarks quite philosophically, that he\r\nbelieves it \"surprised almost every member of the Senate, and\r\ndissatisfied almost all;\" when he wanted a committee raised he did not\r\nmove it himself, but suggested the idea to another Senator, for \"I\r\nknew that if I moved it a spirit of jealousy would immediately be\r\nraised against doing anything.\" Writing once of some resolutions which\r\nhe intended to propose, he says that they are \"another feather against\r\na whirlwind. A desperate and fearful cause in which I have embarked,\r\nbut I must pursue it or feel myself either a coward or a traitor.\"\r\nAnother time we find a committee, of which he was a member, making its\r\nreport when he had not even been notified of its meeting.\r\n\r\nIt would be idle to suppose that any man could be sufficiently callous\r\nnot to feel keenly such treatment. Mr. Adams was far from callous and\r\nhe felt it deeply. But he was not crushed or discouraged by it, as\r\nweaker spirits would have been, nor betrayed into any acts of foolish\r\nanger which must have recoiled upon himself. In him warm feelings were\r\nfound in singular combination with a cool head. An unyielding      (p. 034)\r\ntemper and an obstinate courage, an invincible confidence in his own\r\njudgment, and a stern conscientiousness carried him through these\r\nearlier years of severe trial as they had afterwards to carry him\r\nthrough many more. \"The qualities of mind most peculiarly called for,\"\r\nhe reflects in the Diary, \"are firmness, perseverance, patience,\r\ncoolness, and forbearance. The prospect is not promising; yet the part\r\nto act may be as honorably performed as if success could attend it.\"\r\nHe understood the situation perfectly and met it with a better skill\r\nthan that of the veteran politician. By a long and tedious but sure\r\nprocess he forced his way to steadily increasing influence, and by the\r\nclose of his fourth year we find him taking a part in the business of\r\nthe Senate which may be fairly called prominent and important. He was\r\nconquering success.\r\n\r\nBut if Mr. Adams's unpopularity was partly due to the fact that he was\r\nthe son of his father, it was also largely attributable not only to\r\nhis unconciliatory manners but to more substantial habits of mind and\r\ncharacter. It is probably impossible for any public man, really\r\nindependent in his political action, to lead a very comfortable life\r\namid the struggles of party. Under the disadvantages involved in this\r\nhabit Mr. Adams labored to a remarkable degree. Since parties      (p. 035)\r\nwere first organized in this Republic no American statesman has ever\r\napproached him in persistent freedom of thought, speech, and action.\r\nHe was regarded as a Federalist, but his Federalism was subject to\r\nmany modifications; the members of that party never were sure of his\r\nadherence, and felt bound to him by no very strong ties of political\r\nfellowship. Towards the close of his senatorial term he recorded, in\r\nreminiscence, that he had more often voted with the administration\r\nthan with the opposition.\r\n\r\nThe first matter of importance concerning which he was obliged to act\r\nwas the acquisition of Louisiana and its admission as a state of the\r\nUnion. The Federalists were bitterly opposed to this measure,\r\nregarding it as an undue strengthening of the South and of the slavery\r\ninfluence, to the destruction of the fair balance of power between the\r\ntwo great sections of the country. It was not then the moral aspect of\r\nthe slavery element which stirred the northern temper, but only the\r\nantagonism of interests between the commercial cities of the North and\r\nthe agricultural communities of the South. In the discussions and\r\nvotes which took place in this business Mr. Adams was in favor of the\r\npurchase, but denied with much emphasis the constitutionality of the\r\nprocess by which the purchased territory was brought into the      (p. 036)\r\nfellowship of States. This imperfect allegiance to the party gave more\r\noffence than satisfaction, and he found himself soundly berated in\r\nleading Federalist newspapers in New England, and angrily threatened\r\nwith expulsion from the party. But in the famous impeachment of Judge\r\nChase, which aroused very strong feelings, Mr. Adams was fortunately\r\nable to vote for acquittal. He regarded this measure, as well as the\r\nimpeachment of Judge Pickering at the preceding session, as parts of\r\nan elaborate scheme on the part of the President for degrading the\r\nnational judiciary and rendering it subservient to the legislative\r\nbranch of the government. So many, however, even of Mr. Jefferson's\r\nstanch adherents revolted against his requisitions on this occasion,\r\nand he himself so far lost heart before the final vote was taken, that\r\nseveral Republicans voted with the Federalists, and Mr. Adams could\r\nhardly claim much credit with his party for standing by them in this\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nIt takes a long while for such a man to secure respect, and great\r\nability for him ever to achieve influence. In time, however, Mr. Adams\r\nsaw gratifying indications that he was acquiring both, and in\r\nFebruary, 1806, we find him writing:--\r\n\r\n     \"This is the third session I have sat in Congress. I came in  (p. 037)\r\n     as a member of a very small minority, and during the two former\r\n     sessions almost uniformly avoided to take a lead; any other course\r\n     would have been dishonest or ridiculous. On the very few and\r\n     unimportant objects which I did undertake, I met at first with\r\n     universal opposition. The last session my influence rose a little,\r\n     at the present it has hitherto been apparently rising.\"\r\n\r\nHe was so far a cool and clear-headed judge, even in his own case,\r\nthat this encouraging estimate may be accepted as correct upon his\r\nsole authority without other evidence. But the fair prospect was\r\novercast almost in its dawning, and a period of supreme trial and of\r\napparently irretrievable ruin was at hand.\r\n\r\nTopics were coming forward for discussion concerning which no American\r\ncould be indifferent, and no man of Mr. Adams's spirit could be silent.\r\nThe policy of Great Britain towards this country, and the manner in\r\nwhich it was to be met, stirred profound feelings and opened such\r\nfierce dissensions as it is now difficult to appreciate. For a brief\r\ntime Mr. Adams was to be a prominent actor before the people. It is\r\nfortunately needless to repeat, as it must ever be painful to remember,\r\nthe familiar and too humiliating tale of the part which France and\r\nEngland were permitted for so many years to play in our national\r\npolitics, when our parties were not divided upon American          (p. 038)\r\nquestions, but wholly by their sympathies with one or other of these\r\ncontending European powers. Under Washington the English party had,\r\nwith infinite difficulty, been able to prevent their adversaries from\r\nfairly enlisting the United States as active partisans of France, in\r\nspite of the fact that most insulting treatment was received from that\r\ncountry. Under John Adams the same so-called British faction had been\r\nbaulked in their hope of precipitating a war with the French. Now in\r\nMr. Jefferson's second administration, the French party having won the\r\nascendant, the new phase of the same long struggle presented the\r\nquestion, whether or not we should be drawn into a war with Great\r\nBritain. Grave as must have been the disasters of such a war in 1806,\r\ngrave as they were when the war actually came six years later, yet it\r\nis impossible to recall the provocations which were inflicted upon us\r\nwithout almost regretting that prudence was not cast to the winds and\r\nany woes encountered in preference to unresisting submission to such\r\ninsolent outrages. Our gorge rises at the narration three quarters of\r\na century after the acts were done.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams took his position early and boldly. In February, 1806, he\r\nintroduced into the Senate certain resolutions strongly condemnatory\r\nof the right, claimed and vigorously exercised by the British,     (p. 039)\r\nof seizing neutral vessels employed in conducting with the enemies of\r\nGreat Britain any trade which had been customarily prohibited by that\r\nenemy in time of peace. This doctrine was designed to shut out\r\nAmerican merchants from certain privileges in trading with French\r\ncolonies, which had been accorded only since France had become\r\ninvolved in war with Great Britain. The principle was utterly illegal\r\nand extremely injurious. Mr. Adams, in his first resolution,\r\nstigmatized it \"as an unprovoked aggression upon the property of the\r\ncitizens of these United States, a violation of their neutral rights,\r\nand an encroachment upon their national independence.\" By his second\r\nresolution, the President was requested to demand and insist upon the\r\nrestoration of property seized under this pretext, and upon\r\nindemnification for property already confiscated. By a rare good\r\nfortune, Mr. Adams had the pleasure of seeing his propositions\r\ncarried, only slightly modified by the omission of the words \"to\r\ninsist.\" But they were carried, of course, by Republican votes, and\r\nthey by no means advanced their mover in the favor of the Federalist\r\nparty. Strange as it may seem, that party, of which many of the\r\nforemost supporters were engaged in the very commerce which Great\r\nBritain aimed to suppress and destroy, seemed not to be so much    (p. 040)\r\nincensed against her as against their own government. The theory\r\nof the party was, substantially, that England had been driven into\r\nthese measures by the friendly tone of our government towards France,\r\nand by her own stringent and overruling necessities. The cure was not\r\nto be sought in resistance, not even in indignation and remonstrance\r\naddressed to that power, but rather in cementing an alliance with her,\r\nand even, if need should be, in taking active part in her holy cause.\r\nThe feeling seemed to be that we merited the chastisement because we\r\nhad not allied ourselves with the chastiser. These singular notions of\r\nthe Federalists, however, were by no means the notions of Mr. John\r\nQuincy Adams, as we shall soon see.\r\n\r\nOn April 18, 1806, the Non-importation Act received the approval of\r\nthe President. It was the first measure indicative of resentment or\r\nretaliation which was taken by our government. When it was upon its\r\npassage it encountered the vigorous resistance of the Federalists, but\r\nreceived the support of Mr. Adams. On May 16, 1806, the British\r\ngovernment made another long stride in the course of lawless oppression\r\nof neutrals, which phrase, as commerce then was, signified little else\r\nthan Americans. A proclamation was issued declaring the whole      (p. 041)\r\ncoast of the European continent, from Brest to the mouth of the Elbe,\r\nto be under blockade. In fact, of course, the coast was not blockaded,\r\nand the proclamation was a falsehood, an unjustifiable effort to make\r\nwords do the work of war-ships. The doctrine which it was thus\r\nendeavored to establish had never been admitted into international\r\nlaw, has ever since been repudiated by universal consent of all nations,\r\nand is intrinsically preposterous. The British, however, designed to\r\nmake it effective, and set to work in earnest to confiscate all\r\nvessels and cargoes captured on their way from any neutral nation to\r\nany port within the proscribed district. On November 21, next following,\r\nNapoleon retaliated by the Berlin decree, so called, declaring the\r\nentire British Isles to be under blockade, and forbidding any vessel\r\nwhich had been in any English port after publication of his decree to\r\nenter any port in the dominions under his control. In January, 1807,\r\nEngland made the next move by an order, likewise in contravention of\r\ninternational law, forbidding to neutrals all commerce between ports\r\nof the enemies of Great Britain. On November 11, 1807, the famous\r\nBritish Order in Council was issued, declaring neutral vessels and\r\ncargoes bound to any port or colony of any country with which      (p. 042)\r\nEngland was then at war, and which was closed to English ships, to be\r\nliable to capture and confiscation. A few days later, November 25,\r\n1807, another Order established a rate of duties to be paid in England\r\nupon all neutral merchandise which should be permitted to be carried\r\nin neutral bottoms to countries at war with that power. December 17,\r\n1807, Napoleon retorted by the Milan decree, which declared\r\ndenationalized and subject to capture and condemnation every vessel,\r\nto whatsoever nation belonging, which should have submitted to search\r\nby an English ship, or should be on a voyage to England, or should\r\nhave paid any tax to the English government. All these regulations,\r\nthough purporting to be aimed at neutrals generally, in fact bore\r\nalmost exclusively upon the United States, who alone were undertaking\r\nto conduct any neutral commerce worthy of mention. As Mr. Adams\r\nafterwards remarked, the effect of these illegal proclamations and\r\nunjustifiable novel doctrines \"placed the commerce and shipping of the\r\nUnited States, with regard to all Europe and European colonies (Sweden\r\nalone excepted), in nearly the same state as it would have been, if,\r\non that same 11th of November, England and France had both declared\r\nwar against the United States.\" The merchants of this country might as\r\nwell have burned their ships as have submitted to these decrees.   (p. 043)\r\n\r\nAll this while the impressment of American seamen by British ships of\r\nwar was being vigorously prosecuted. This is one of those outrages so\r\nlong ago laid away among the mouldering tombs in the historical\r\ngraveyard that few persons now appreciate its enormity, or the extent\r\nto which it was carried. Those who will be at the pains to ascertain\r\nthe truth in the matter will feel that the bloodiest, most costly, and\r\nmost disastrous war would have been better than tame endurance of\r\ntreatment so brutal and unjustifiable that it finds no parallel even\r\nin the long and dark list of wrongs which Great Britain has been wont\r\nto inflict upon all the weaker or the uncivilized peoples with whom\r\nshe has been brought or has gratuitously forced herself into unwelcome\r\ncontact. It was not an occasional act of high-handed arrogance that\r\nwas done; there were not only a few unfortunate victims, of whom a\r\nlarge proportion might be of unascertained nationality. It was an\r\norganized system worked upon a very large scale. Every American seaman\r\nfelt it necessary to have a certificate of citizenship, accompanied by\r\na description of his features and of all the marks upon his person, as\r\nMr. Adams said, \"like the advertisement for a runaway negro slave.\"\r\nNor was even this protection by any means sure to be always        (p. 044)\r\nefficient. The number of undoubted American citizens who were seized\r\nrose in a few years actually to many thousands. They were often taken\r\nwithout so much as a false pretence to right; but with the acknowledgment\r\nthat they were Americans, they were seized upon the plea of a necessity\r\nfor their services in the British ship. Some American vessels were\r\nleft so denuded of seamen that they were lost at sea for want of hands\r\nto man them; the destruction of lives as well as property,\r\nunquestionably thus caused, was immense. When after the lapse of a\r\nlong time and of infinite negotiation the American citizenship of some\r\nindividual was clearly shown, still the chances of his return were\r\nsmall; some false and ignoble subterfuge was resorted to; he was not\r\nto be found; the name did not occur on the rolls of the navy; he had\r\ndied, or been discharged, or had deserted, or had been shot. The more\r\nillegal the act committed by any British officer the more sure he was\r\nof reward, till it seemed that the impressment of American citizens\r\nwas an even surer road to promotion than valor in an engagement with\r\nthe enemy. Such were the substantial wrongs inflicted by Great\r\nBritain; nor were any pains taken to cloak their character; on the\r\ncontrary, they were done with more than British insolence and\r\noffensiveness, and were accompanied with insults which alone       (p. 045)\r\nconstituted sufficient provocation to war. To all this, for a long\r\ntime, nothing but empty and utterly futile protests were opposed by\r\nthis country. The affair of the Chesapeake, indeed, threatened for a\r\nbrief moment to bring things to a crisis. That vessel, an American\r\nfrigate, commanded by Commodore Barron, sailed on June 22, 1807, from\r\nHampton Roads. The Leopard, a British fifty-gun ship, followed her,\r\nand before she was out of sight of land, hailed her and demanded the\r\ndelivery of four men, of whom three at least were surely native\r\nAmericans. Barron refused the demand, though his ship was wholly\r\nunprepared for action. Thereupon the Englishman opened his broadsides,\r\nkilled three men and wounded sixteen, boarded the Chesapeake and took\r\noff the four sailors. They were carried to Halifax and tried by\r\ncourt-martial for desertion: one of them was hanged; one died in\r\nconfinement, and five years elapsed before the other two were returned\r\nto the Chesapeake in Boston harbor. This wound was sufficiently deep\r\nto arouse a real spirit of resentment and revenge, and England went so\r\nfar as to dispatch Mr. Rose to this country upon a pretended mission\r\nof peace, though the fraudulent character of his errand was sufficiently\r\nindicated by the fact that within a few hours after his departure the\r\nfirst of the above named Orders in Council was issued but had not  (p. 046)\r\nbeen communicated to him. As Mr. Adams indignantly said, \"the same\r\npenful of ink which signed his instructions might have been used also\r\nto sign these illegal orders.\" Admiral Berkeley, the commander of the\r\nLeopard, received the punishment which he might justly have expected\r\nif precedent was to count for anything in the naval service of Great\r\nBritain,--he was promoted.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly worth while to endeavor to measure the comparative\r\nwrongfulness of the conduct of England and of France. The behavior of\r\neach was utterly unjustifiable; though England by committing the first\r\nextreme breach of international law gave to France the excuse of\r\nretaliation. There was, however, vast difference in the practical\r\neffect of the British and French decrees. The former wrought serious\r\ninjury, falling little short of total destruction, to American\r\nshipping and commerce; the latter were only in a much less degree\r\nhurtful. The immense naval power of England and the channels in which\r\nour trade naturally flowed combined to make her destructive capacity\r\nas towards us very great. It was the outrages inflicted by her which\r\nbrought the merchants of the United States face to face with ruin;\r\nthey suffered not very greatly at the hands of Napoleon. Neither could\r\nthe villainous process of impressment be conducted by Frenchmen.   (p. 047)\r\nFrance gave us cause for war, but England seemed resolved to drive us\r\ninto it.\r\n\r\nAs British aggressions grew steadily and rapidly more intolerable, Mr.\r\nAdams found himself straining farther and farther away from those\r\nFederalist moorings at which, it must be confessed, he had long swung\r\nvery precariously. The constituency which he represented was indeed in\r\na quandary so embarrassing as hardly to be capable of maintaining any\r\nconsistent policy. The New England of that day was a trading\r\ncommunity, of which the industry and capital were almost exclusively\r\ncentred in ship-owning and commerce. The merchants, almost to a man,\r\nhad long been the most Anglican of Federalists in their political\r\nsympathies. Now they found themselves suffering utterly ruinous\r\ntreatment at the hands of those whom they had loved overmuch. They\r\nwere being ruthlessly destroyed by their friends, to whom they had\r\nbeen, so to speak, almost disloyally loyal. They saw their business\r\nannihilated, their property seized, and yet could not give utterance\r\nto resentment, or counsel resistance, without such a humiliating\r\ndevouring of all their own principles and sentiments as they could by\r\nno possibility bring themselves to endure. There was but one road open\r\nto them, and that was the ignoble one of casting themselves wholly (p. 048)\r\ninto the arms of England, of rewarding her blows with caresses, of\r\nsubmitting to be fairly scourged into a servile alliance with her. It\r\nis not surprising that the independent temper of Mr. Adams revolted at\r\nthe position which his party seemed not reluctant to assume at this\r\njuncture. Yet not very much better seemed for a time the policy of the\r\nadministration. Jefferson was far from being a man for troubled\r\nseasons, which called for high spirit and executive energy. His\r\nflotillas of gunboats and like idle and silly fantasies only excited\r\nMr. Adams's disgust. In fact, there was upon all sides a strong dread\r\nof a war with England, not always openly expressed, but now perfectly\r\nvisible, arising with some from regard for that country, in others\r\nprompted by fear of her power. Alone among public men Mr. Adams, while\r\nearnestly hoping to escape war, was not willing to seek that escape by\r\nunlimited weakness and unbounded submission to lawless injury.\r\n\r\nOn November 17, 1807, Mr. Adams, who never in his life allowed fear to\r\nbecome a motive, wrote, with obvious contempt and indignation: \"I\r\nobserve among the members great embarrassment, alarm, anxiety, and\r\nconfusion of mind, but no preparation for any measure of vigor, and an\r\nobvious strong disposition to yield all that Great Britain may     (p. 049)\r\nrequire, to preserve peace, under a thin external show of dignity and\r\nbravery.\" This tame and vacillating spirit roused his ire, and as it\r\nwas chiefly manifested by his own party it alienated him from them\r\nfarther than ever. Yet his wrath was so far held in reasonable check\r\nby his discretion that he would still have liked to avoid the perilous\r\nconclusion of arms, and though his impulse was to fight, yet he could\r\nnot but recognize that the sensible course was to be content, for the\r\ntime at least, with a manifestation of resentment, and the most vigorous\r\nacts short of war which the government could be induced to undertake.\r\nOn this sentiment were based his introduction of the aforementioned\r\nresolutions, his willingness to support the administration, and his\r\nvote for the Non-importation Act in spite of a dislike for it as a\r\nvery imperfectly satisfactory measure. But it was not alone his\r\nnaturally independent temper which led him thus to feel so differently\r\nfrom other members of his party. In Europe he had had opportunities of\r\nforming a judgment more accurate than was possible for most Americans\r\nconcerning the sentiments and policy of England towards this country.\r\nNot only had he been present at the negotiations resulting in the\r\ntreaty of peace, but he had also afterwards been for several months\r\nengaged in the personal discussion of commercial questions with    (p. 050)\r\nthe British minister of foreign affairs. From all that he had thus\r\nseen and heard he had reached the conviction, unquestionably correct,\r\nthat the British were not only resolved to adopt a selfish course\r\ntowards the United States, which might have been expected, but that\r\nthey were consistently pursuing the further distinct design of crippling\r\nand destroying American commerce, to the utmost degree which their own\r\nextensive trade and great naval authority and power rendered possible.\r\nSo long as he held this firm belief, it was inevitable that he should\r\nbe at issue with the Federalists in all matters concerning our policy\r\ntowards Great Britain. The ill-will naturally engendered in him by\r\nthis conviction was increased to profound indignation when illiberal\r\nmeasures were succeeded by insults, by substantial wrongs in direct\r\ncontravention of law, and by acts properly to be described as of real\r\nhostility. For Mr. Adams was by nature not only independent, but\r\nresentful and combative. When, soon after the attack of the Leopard\r\nupon the Chesapeake, he heard the transaction \"openly justified at\r\nnoon-day,\" by a prominent Federalist,[1] \"in a public insurance office\r\nupon the exchange at Boston,\" his temper rose. \"This,\" he afterward\r\nwrote, \"this was the cause ... which alienated me from that day    (p. 051)\r\nand forever from the councils of the Federal party.\" When the news\r\nof that outrage reached Boston, Mr. Adams was there, and desired that\r\nthe leading Federalists in the city should at once \"take the lead in\r\npromoting a strong and clear expression of the sentiments of the\r\npeople, and in an open and free-hearted manner, setting aside all\r\nparty feelings, declare their determination at that crisis to support\r\nthe government of their country.\" But unfortunately these gentlemen\r\nwere by no means prepared for any such action, and foolishly left it\r\nfor the friends of the administration to give the first utterance to a\r\nfeeling which it is hard to excuse any American for not entertaining\r\nbeneath such provocation. It was the Jeffersonians, accordingly, who\r\nconvened \"an informal meeting of the citizens of Boston and the\r\nneighboring towns,\" at which Mr. Adams was present, and by which he\r\nwas put upon a committee to draw and report resolutions. These\r\nresolutions pledged a cheerful coöperation \"in any measures, however\r\nserious,\" which the government might deem necessary and a support of\r\nthe same with \"lives and fortunes.\" The Federalists, learning too late\r\nthat their backwardness at this crisis was a blunder, caused a town\r\nmeeting to be called at Faneuil Hall a few days later. This also   (p. 052)\r\nMr. Adams attended, and again was put on the committee to draft\r\nresolutions, which were only a little less strong than those of the\r\nearlier assemblage. But though many of the Federalists thus tardily\r\nand reluctantly fell in with the popular sentiment, they were for the\r\nmost part heartily incensed against Mr. Adams. They threatened him\r\nthat he should \"have his head taken off for apostasy,\" and gave him to\r\nunderstand that he \"should no longer be considered as having any\r\ncommunion with the party.\" If he had not already quite left them, they\r\nnow turned him out from their community. But such abusive treatment\r\nwas ill adapted to influence a man of his temper. Martyrdom, which in\r\ntime he came to relish, had not now any terrors for him; and he would\r\nhave lost as many heads as ever grew on Hydra, ere he would have\r\nyielded on a point of principle.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1: Mr. John Lowell.]\r\n\r\nHis spirit was soon to be demonstrated. Congress was convened in extra\r\nsession on October 26, 1807. The administration brought forward the\r\nbill establishing an embargo. The measure may now be pronounced a\r\nblunder, and its proposal created a howl of rage and anguish from the\r\ncommercial states, who saw in it only their utter ruin. Already a\r\nstrong sectional feeling had been developed between the planters   (p. 053)\r\nof the South and the merchants of the North and East, and the latter\r\nnow united in the cry that their quarter was to be ruined by the\r\nignorant policy of this Virginian President. Terrible then was their\r\nwrath, when they actually saw a Massachusetts Senator boldly give his\r\nvote for what they deemed the most odious and wicked bill which had\r\never been presented in the halls of Congress. Nay, more, they learned\r\nwith horror that Mr. Adams had even been a member of the committee\r\nwhich reported the bill, and that he had joined in the report.\r\nHenceforth the Federal party was to be like a hive of enraged hornets\r\nabout the devoted renegade. No abuse which they could heap upon him\r\nseemed nearly adequate to the occasion. They despised him; they\r\nloathed him; they said and believed that he was false, selfish,\r\ndesigning, a traitor, an apostate, that he had run away from a failing\r\ncause, that he had sold himself. The language of contumely was\r\nexhausted in vain efforts to describe his baseness. Not even yet has\r\nthe echo of the hard names which he was called quite died away in the\r\nland; and there are still families in New England with whom his\r\ndishonest tergiversation remains a traditional belief.\r\n\r\nNever was any man more unjustly aspersed. It is impossible to view all\r\nthe evidence dispassionately without not only acquitting Mr.       (p. 054)\r\nAdams but greatly admiring his courage, his constancy, his independence.\r\nWhether the embargo was a wise and efficient or a futile and useless\r\nmeasure has little to do with the question of his conduct. The emergency\r\ncalled for strong action. The Federalists suggested only a temporizing\r\nsubmission, or that we should avert the terrible wrath of England by\r\ncrawling beneath her lashes into political and commercial servitude.\r\nMr. Jefferson thought the embargo would do, that it would aid him in\r\nhis negotiations with England sufficiently to enable him to bring her\r\nto terms; he had before thought the same of the Non-importation Act.\r\nMr. Adams felt, properly enough, concerning both these schemes, that\r\nthey were insufficient and in many respects objectionable; but that to\r\ngive the administration hearty support in the most vigorous measures\r\nwhich it was willing to undertake, was better than to aid an opposition\r\nutterly nerveless and servile and altogether devoid of so much as the\r\ndesire for efficient action. It was no time to stay with the party of\r\nweakness; it was right to strengthen rather than to hamper a man so\r\npacific and spiritless as Mr. Jefferson; to show a readiness to\r\nforward even his imperfect expedients; to display a united and\r\nindignant, if not quite a hostile front to Great Britain, rather   (p. 055)\r\nthan to exhibit a tame and friendly feeling towards her. It was for\r\nthese reasons, which had already controlled his action concerning the\r\nnon-importation bill, that Mr. Adams joined in reporting the embargo\r\nbill and voted for it. He never pretended that he himself had any\r\nespecial fancy for either of these measures, or that he regarded them\r\nas the best that could be devised under the circumstances. On the\r\ncontrary, he hoped that the passage of the embargo would allow of the\r\nrepeal of its predecessor. That he expected some good from it, and\r\nthat it did some little good, cannot be denied. It did save a great\r\ndeal of American property, both shipping and merchandise, from seizure\r\nand condemnation; and if it cut off the income it at least saved much\r\nof the principal of our merchants. If only the bill had been promptly\r\nrepealed so soon as this protective purpose had been achieved, without\r\nawaiting further and altogether impossible benefits to accrue from it\r\nas an offensive measure, it might perhaps have left a better memory\r\nbehind it. Unfortunately no one can deny that it was continued much\r\ntoo long. Mr. Adams saw this error and dreaded the consequences. After\r\nhe had left Congress and had gone back to private life, he exerted all\r\nthe influence which he had with the Republican members of Congress to\r\nsecure its repeal and the substitution of the Non-intercourse      (p. 056)\r\nAct, an exchange which was in time accomplished, though much too tardily.\r\nNay, much more than this, Mr. Adams stands forth almost alone as the\r\nadvocate of threatening if not of actually belligerent measures. He\r\nexpressed his belief that \"our internal resources [were] competent to\r\nthe establishment and maintenance of a naval force, public and\r\nprivate, if not fully adequate to the protection and defence of our\r\ncommerce, at least sufficient to induce a retreat from hostilities,\r\nand to deter from a renewal of them by either of the warring parties;\"\r\nand he insisted that \"a system to that effect might be formed,\r\nultimately far more economical, and certainly more energetic,\" than\r\nthe embargo. But his \"resolution met no encouragement.\" He found that\r\nit was the embargo or nothing, and he thought the embargo was a little\r\nbetter than nothing, as probably it was.\r\n\r\nAll the arguments which Mr. Adams advanced were far from satisfying\r\nhis constituents in those days of wild political excitement, and they\r\nquickly found the means of intimating their unappeasable displeasure\r\nin a way certainly not open to misapprehension. Mr. Adams's term of\r\nservice in the Senate was to expire on March 3, 1809. On June 2 and 3,\r\n1808, anticipating by many months the customary time for filling   (p. 057)\r\nthe coming vacancy, the legislature of Massachusetts proceeded to\r\nchoose James Lloyd, junior, his successor. The votes were, in the\r\nSenate 21 for Mr. Lloyd, 17 for Mr. Adams; in the House 248 for Mr.\r\nLloyd, and 213 for Mr. Adams. A more insulting method of administering\r\na rebuke could not have been devised. At the same time, in further\r\nexpression of disapprobation, resolutions strongly condemnatory of the\r\nembargo were passed. Mr. Adams was not the man to stay where he was\r\nnot wanted, and on June 8 he sent in his letter of resignation. On the\r\nnext day Mr. Lloyd was chosen to serve for the balance of his term.\r\n\r\nThus John Quincy Adams changed sides. The son of John Adams lost the\r\nsenatorship for persistently supporting the administration of Thomas\r\nJefferson. It was indeed a singular spectacle! In 1803 he had been\r\nsent to the Senate of the United States by Federalists as a Federalist;\r\nin 1808 he had abjured them and they had repudiated him; in 1809, as\r\nwe are soon to see, he received a foreign appointment from the\r\nRepublican President Madison, and was confirmed by a Republican\r\nSenate. Many of Mr. Adams's acts, many of his traits, have been\r\nharshly criticised, but for no act that he ever did or ever was\r\ncharged with doing has he been so harshly assailed as for this     (p. 058)\r\njourney from one camp to the other. The gentlemen of wealth, position,\r\nand influence in Eastern Massachusetts, almost to a man, turned\r\nagainst him with virulence; many of their descendants still cherish\r\nthe ancestral prejudice; and it may yet be a long while before the\r\nlast mutterings of this deep-rooted antipathy die away. But that they\r\nwill die away in time cannot be doubted. Praise will succeed to blame.\r\nTruth must prevail in a case where such abundant evidence is\r\naccessible; and the truth is that Mr. Adams's conduct was not ignoble,\r\nmean, and traitorous, but honorable, courageous, and disinterested.\r\nThose who singled him out for assault, though deaf to his arguments,\r\nmight even then have reflected that within a few years a large\r\nproportion of the whole nation had changed in their opinions as he had\r\nnow at last changed in his, so that the party which under Washington\r\nhardly had an existence and under John Adams was not, until the last\r\nmoment, seriously feared, now showed an enormous majority throughout\r\nthe whole country. Even in Massachusetts, the intrenched camp of the\r\nFederalists, one half of the population were now Republicans. But that\r\nchange of political sentiment which in the individual voter is often\r\nadmired as evidence of independent thought is stigmatized in       (p. 059)\r\nthose more prominent in politics as tergiversation and apostasy.\r\n\r\nIt may be admitted that there are sound reasons for holding party\r\nleaders to a more rigid allegiance to party policy than is expected of\r\nthe rank and file; yet certainly, at those periods when substantially\r\nnew measures and new doctrines come to the front, the old party names\r\nlose whatever sacredness may at other times be in them, and the\r\npolitical fellowships of the past may properly be reformed. Novel\r\nproblems cannot always find old comrades still united in opinions.\r\nPrecisely such was the case with John Quincy Adams and the Federalists.\r\nThe earlier Federalist creed related to one set of issues, the later\r\nFederalist creed to quite another set; the earlier creed was sound and\r\ndeserving of support; the later creed was not so. It is easy to see,\r\nas one looks backward upon history, that every great and successful\r\nparty has its mission, that it wins its success through the substantial\r\nrighteousness of that mission, and that it owes its downfall to\r\nassuming an erroneous attitude towards some subsequent matter which\r\nbecomes in turn of predominating importance. Sometimes, though rarely,\r\na party remains on the right side through two or even more successive\r\nissues of profound consequence to the nation. The Federalist mission\r\nwas to establish the Constitution of the United States as a        (p. 060)\r\nvigorous, efficient, and practical system of government, to prove its\r\nsoundness, safety, and efficacy, and to defend it from the undermining\r\nassaults of those who distrusted it and would have reduced it to\r\nimbecility. Supplementary and cognate to this was the further task of\r\ngiving the young nation and the new system a chance to get fairly\r\nstarted in life before being subjected to the strain of war and\r\nEuropean entanglements. To this end it was necessary to hold in check\r\nthe Jeffersonian or French party, who sought to embroil us in a\r\nforeign quarrel. These two functions of the Federalist party were\r\nquite in accord; they involved the organizing and domestic instinct\r\nagainst the disorganizing and meddlesome; the strengthening against\r\nthe enfeebling process; practical thinking against fanciful theories.\r\nFortunately the able men had been generally of the sound persuasion,\r\nand by powerful exertions had carried the day and accomplished their\r\nallotted tasks so thoroughly that all subsequent generations of\r\nAmericans have been reaping the benefit of their labors. But by the\r\ntime that John Adams had concluded his administration the great\r\nFederalist work had been sufficiently done. Those who still believe\r\nthat there is an overruling Providence in the affairs of men and\r\nnations may well point to the history of this period in support    (p. 061)\r\nof their theory. Republicanism was not able to triumph till Federalism\r\nhad fulfilled all its proper duty and was on the point of going wrong.\r\n\r\nDuring this earlier period John Quincy Adams had been a Federalist by\r\nconviction as well as by education. Nor was there any obvious reason\r\nfor him to change his political faith with the change of party\r\nsuccess, brought about as that was before its necessity was apparent\r\nbut by the sure and inscrutable wisdom so marvellously enclosed in the\r\ngreat popular instinct. It was not patent, when Mr. Jefferson\r\nsucceeded Mr. Adams, that Federalism was soon to become an unsound\r\npolitical creed--unsound, not because it had been defeated, but\r\nbecause it had done its work, and in the new emergency was destined to\r\nblunder. During Mr. Jefferson's first administration no questions of\r\nnovel import arose. But they were not far distant, and soon were\r\npresented by the British aggressions. A grave crisis was created by\r\nthis system of organized destruction of property and wholesale\r\nstealing of citizens, now suddenly practised with such terrible\r\nenergy. What was to be done? What had the two great parties to advise\r\nconcerning the policy of the country in this hour of peril?\r\nUnfortunately for the Federalists old predilections were allowed   (p. 062)\r\nnow to govern their present action. Excusably Anglican in the bygone\r\ndays of Genet's mission, they now remained still Anglican, when to be\r\nAnglican was to be emphatically un-American. As one reads the history\r\nof 1807 and 1808 it is impossible not to feel almost a sense of\r\npersonal gratitude to John Quincy Adams that he dared to step out from\r\nhis meek-spirited party and do all that circumstances rendered\r\npossible to promote resistance to insults and wrongs intolerable. In\r\ntruth, he was always a man of high temper, and eminently a patriotic\r\ncitizen of the United States. Unlike too many even of the best among\r\nhis countrymen in those early years of the Republic, he had no foreign\r\nsympathies whatsoever; he was neither French nor English, but wholly,\r\nexclusively, and warmly American. He had no second love; the United\r\nStates filled his public heart and monopolized his political\r\naffections. When he was abroad he established neither affiliations nor\r\nantipathies, and when he was at home he drifted with no party whose\r\ncourse was governed by foreign magnets. It needs only that this\r\ncharacteristic should be fully understood in order that his conduct in\r\n1808 should be not alone vindicated but greatly admired.\r\n\r\nAt that time it was said, and it has been since repeated, that he  (p. 063)\r\nwas allured by the loaves and fishes which the Republicans could\r\ndistribute, while the Federalists could cast to him only meagre and\r\nuncertain crusts. Circumstances gave to the accusation such a\r\nsuperficial plausibility that it was believed by many honest men under\r\nthe influence of political prejudice. But such a charge, alleged\r\nconcerning a single act in a long public career, is to be scanned with\r\nsuspicion. Disproof by demonstration is impossible; but it is fair to\r\nseek for the character of the act in a study of the character of the\r\nactor, as illustrated by the rest of his career. Thus seeking we shall\r\nsee that, if any traits can be surely predicated of any man,\r\nindependence, courage, and honesty may be predicated of Mr. Adams. His\r\nlong public life had many periods of trial, yet this is the sole\r\noccasion when it is so much as possible seriously to question the\r\npurity of his motives--for the story of his intrigue with Mr. Clay to\r\nsecure the Presidency was never really believed by any one except\r\nGeneral Jackson, and the beliefs of General Jackson are of little\r\nconsequence. From the earliest to the latest day of his public life,\r\nhe was never a party man. He is entitled to the justification to be\r\nderived from this life-long habit, when, in 1807-8, he voted against\r\nthe wishes of those who had hoped to hold him in the bonds of      (p. 064)\r\npartisan alliance. In point of fact, so far from these acts being a\r\nyielding to selfish and calculating temptation, they called for great\r\ncourage and strength of mind; instead of being tergiversation, they\r\nwere a triumph in a severe ordeal. Mr. Adams was not so dull as to\r\nunderrate, nor so void of good feeling as to be careless of, the storm\r\nof obloquy which he had to encounter, not only in such shape as is\r\ncustomary in like instances of a change of sides in politics, but, in\r\nhis present case, of a peculiarly painful kind. He was to seem\r\nunfaithful, not only to a party, but to the bitter feud of a father\r\nwhom he dearly loved and greatly respected; he was to be reviled by\r\nthe neighbors and friends who constituted his natural social circle in\r\nBoston; he was to alienate himself from the rich, the cultivated, the\r\ninfluential gentlemen of his neighborhood, his comrades, who would\r\nalmost universally condemn his conduct. He was to lose his position as\r\nSenator, and probably to destroy all hopes of further political\r\nsuccess so far as it depended upon the good will of the people of his\r\nown State. In this he was at least giving up a certainty in exchange\r\nfor what even his enemies must admit to have been only an expectation.\r\n\r\nBut in fact it is now evident that there was not upon his part even an\r\nexpectation. At the first signs of the views which he was likely   (p. 065)\r\nto hold, that contemptible but influential Republican, Giles, of\r\nVirginia, also one or two others of the same party, sought to approach\r\nhim with insinuating suggestions. But Mr. Adams met these advances in\r\na manner frigid and repellent even beyond his wont, and far from\r\nseeking to conciliate these emissaries, and to make a bargain, or even\r\nestablish a tacit understanding for his own benefit, he held them far\r\naloof, and simply stated that he wished and expected nothing from the\r\nadministration. His mind was made up, his opinion was formed; no bribe\r\nwas needed to secure his vote. Not thus do men sell themselves in\r\npolitics. The Republicans were fairly notified that he was going to do\r\njust as he chose; and Mr. Jefferson, the arch-enemy of all Adamses,\r\nhad no occasion to forego his feud to win this recruit from that\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams's Diary shows unmistakably that he was acting rigidly upon\r\nprinciple, that he believed himself to be injuring or even destroying\r\nhis political prospects, and that in so doing he taxed his moral\r\ncourage severely. The whole tone of the Diary, apart from those few\r\ndistinct statements which hostile critics might view with distrust, is\r\ndespondent, often bitter, but defiant and stubborn. If in later life\r\nhe ever anticipated the possible publication of these private      (p. 066)\r\npages, yet he could hardly have done so at this early day. Among\r\ncertain general reflections at the close of the year 1808, he writes:\r\n\"On most of the great national questions now under discussion, my\r\nsense of duty leads me to support the Administration, and I find\r\nmyself, of course, in opposition to the Federalists in general. But I\r\nhave no communication with the President, other than that in the\r\nregular order of business in the Senate. In this state of things my\r\nsituation calls in a peculiar manner for prudence; my political\r\nprospects are declining, and, as my term of service draws near its\r\nclose, I am constantly approaching to the certainty of being restored\r\nto the situation of a private citizen. For this event, however, I hope\r\nto have my mind sufficiently prepared.\"\r\n\r\nIn July, 1808, the Republicans of the Congressional District wished to\r\nsend him to the House of Representatives, but to the gentleman who\r\nwaited upon him with this proposal he returned a decided negative.\r\nOther considerations apart, he would not interfere with the reëlection\r\nof his friend, Mr. Quincy.\r\n\r\nCertain remarks, written when his senatorial term was far advanced,\r\nwhen he had lost the confidence of the Federalists without obtaining\r\nthat of the Republicans, may be of interest at this point. He wrote,\r\nOctober 30, 1807: \"I employed the whole evening in looking over    (p. 067)\r\nthe Journal of the Senate, since I have been one of its members. Of\r\nthe very little business which I have commenced during the four\r\nsessions, at least three fourths has failed, with circumstances of\r\npeculiar mortification. The very few instances in which I have\r\nsucceeded, have been always after an opposition of great obstinacy,\r\noften ludicrously contrasting with the insignificance of the object in\r\npursuit. More than one instance has occurred where the same thing\r\nwhich I have assiduously labored in vain to effect has been afterwards\r\naccomplished by others, without the least resistance; more than once,\r\nwhere the pleasure of disappointing me has seemed to be the prominent\r\nprinciple of decision. Of the preparatory business, matured in\r\ncommittees, I have had a share, gradually increasing through the four\r\nsessions, but always as a subordinate member. The merely laborious\r\nduties have been readily assigned to me, and as readily undertaken and\r\ndischarged. My success has been more frequent in opposition than in\r\ncarrying any proposition of my own, and I hope I have been\r\ninstrumental in arresting many unadvised purposes and projects. Though\r\nas to the general policy of the country I have been uniformly in a\r\nsmall, and constantly deceasing minority; my opinions and votes have\r\nbeen much oftener in unison with the Administration than with      (p. 068)\r\ntheir opponents; I have met with at least as much opposition from\r\nmy party friends as from their adversaries,--I believe more. I know\r\nnot that I have made any personal enemies now in Senate, nor can I\r\nflatter myself with having acquired any personal friends. There have\r\nbeen hitherto two, Mr. Tracey and Mr. Plumer, upon whom I could rely,\r\nbut it has pleased Providence to remove one by death, and the changes\r\nof political party have removed the other.\" This is a striking\r\nparagraph, certainly not written by a man in a very cheerful or\r\nsanguine frame of mind, not by one who congratulates himself on having\r\nskilfully taken the initial steps in a brilliant political career;\r\nbut, it is fair to say, by one who has at least tried to do his duty,\r\nand who has not knowingly permitted himself to be warped either by\r\npassion, prejudice, party alliances, or selfish considerations.\r\n\r\nAs early as November, 1805, Mr. Adams, being still what may be\r\ndescribed as an independent Federalist, was approached by Dr. Rush\r\nwith tentative suggestions concerning a foreign mission. Mr. Madison,\r\nthen Secretary of State, and even President Jefferson were apparently\r\nnot disinclined to give him such employment, provided he would be\r\nwilling to accept it at their hands. Mr. Adams simply replied,     (p. 069)\r\nthat he would not refuse a nomination merely because it came from Mr.\r\nJefferson, though there was no office in the President's gift for\r\nwhich he had any wish. Perhaps because of the unconciliatory coolness\r\nof this response, or perhaps for some better reason, the nomination\r\ndid not follow at that time. No sooner, however, had Mr. Madison\r\nfairly taken the oath of office as President than he bethought him of\r\nMr. Adams, now no longer a Federalist, but, concerning the present\r\nissues, of the Republican persuasion. On March 6, 1809, Mr. Adams was\r\nnotified by the President personally of the intention to nominate him\r\nas Minister Plenipotentiary to Russia. It was a new mission, the first\r\nminister ever nominated to Russia having been only a short time before\r\nrejected by the Senate. But the Emperor had often expressed his wish\r\nto exchange ministers, and Mr. Madison was anxious to comply with the\r\ncourteous request. Mr. Adams's name was accordingly at once sent to\r\nthe Senate. But on the following day, March 7, that body resolved that\r\n\"it is inexpedient at this time to appoint a minister from the United\r\nStates to the Court of Russia.\" The vote was seventeen to fifteen, and\r\namong the seventeen was Mr. Adams's old colleague, Timothy Pickering,\r\nwho probably never in his life cast a vote which gave him so much  (p. 070)\r\npleasure. Mr. Madison, however, did not readily desist from his\r\npurpose, and a few months later, June 26, he sent a message to the\r\nSenate, stating that the considerations previously leading him to\r\nnominate a minister to Russia had since been strengthened, and again\r\nnaming Mr. Adams for the post. This time the nomination was confirmed\r\nwith readiness, by a vote of nineteen to seven, Mr. Pickering, of\r\ncourse, being one of the still hostile minority.\r\n\r\nAt noon on August 5, 1809, records Mr. Adams, \"I left my house at the\r\ncorner of Boylston and Nassau streets, in Boston,\" again to make the\r\ntedious and uncomfortable voyage across the Atlantic. A miserable and\r\na dangerous time he had of it ere, on October 23, he reached St.\r\nPetersburg. Concerning the four years and a half which he is now to\r\nspend in Russia very little need be said. His active duties were of\r\nthe simplest character, amounting to little more than rendering\r\noccasional assistance to American shipmasters suffering beneath the\r\nseverities so often illegally inflicted by the contesting powers of\r\nEurope. But apart from the slender practical service to be done, the\r\nperiod must have been interesting and agreeable for him personally,\r\nfor he was received and treated throughout his stay by the Emperor\r\nand his courtiers with distinguished kindness. The Emperor, who    (p. 071)\r\noften met him walking, used to stop and chat with him, while Count\r\nRomanzoff, the minister of foreign affairs, was cordial beyond the\r\nordinary civility of diplomacy. The Diary records a series of court\r\npresentations, balls, fêtes, dinners, diplomatic and other, launches,\r\ndisplays of fireworks, birthday festivities, parades, baptisms, plays,\r\nstate funerals, illuminations, and Te Deums for victories; in short,\r\nevery species of social gayety and public pageant. At all these Mr.\r\nAdams was always a bidden and apparently a welcome guest. It must be\r\nadmitted, even by his detractors, that he was an admirable\r\nrepresentative of the United States abroad. Having already seen much\r\nof the distinguished society of European courts, but retaining a\r\nrepublican simplicity, which was wholly genuine and a natural part of\r\nhis character and therefore was never affected or offensive in its\r\nmanifestations, he really represented the best element in the politics\r\nand society of the United States. Winning respect for himself he won\r\nit also for the country which he represented. Thus he was able to\r\nrender an indirect but essential service in cementing the kindly\r\nfeeling which the Russian Empire entertained for the American Republic.\r\nRussia could then do us little good and almost no harm, yet the    (p. 072)\r\nfriendship of a great European power had a certain moral value in\r\nthose days of our national infancy. That friendship, so cordially\r\noffered, Mr. Adams was fortunately well fitted to conciliate, showing\r\nin his foreign callings a tact which did not mark him in other public\r\nrelations. He was perhaps less liked by his travelling fellow\r\ncountrymen than by the Russians. The paltry ambition of a certain\r\nclass of Americans for introduction to high society disgusted him\r\ngreatly, and he was not found an efficient ally by these would-be\r\ncomrades of the Russian aristocracy. \"The ambition of young Americans\r\nto crowd themselves upon European courts and into the company of\r\nnobility is a very ridiculous and not a very proud feature of their\r\ncharacter,\" he wrote; \"there is nothing, in my estimate of things,\r\nmeaner than courting society where, if admitted, it is only to be\r\ndespised.\" He himself happily combined extensive acquirements,\r\nexcellent ability, diplomatic and courtly experience, and natural\r\nindependence of character without ill-bred self-assertion, and never\r\nfailed to create a good impression in the many circles into which his\r\nforeign career introduced him.\r\n\r\nThe ambassadors and ministers from European powers at St. Petersburg\r\nwere constantly wrangling about precedence and like petty matters of\r\ncourt etiquette. \"In all these controversies,\" writes Mr. Adams,   (p. 073)\r\n\"I have endeavored to consider it as an affair in which I, as an\r\n_American_ minister, had no concern; and that my only principle is to\r\ndispute upon precedence with nobody.\" A good-natured contempt for\r\nEuropean follies may be read between the lines of this remark; wherein\r\nit may be said that the Monroe Doctrine is applied to court etiquette.\r\n\r\nHe always made it a point to live within the meagre income which the\r\nUnited States allowed him, but seems to have suffered no diminution of\r\nconsideration for this reason. One morning, walking on the Fontanka,\r\nhe met the Emperor, who said: \"Mons. Adams, il y a cent ans que je ne\r\nvous ai vu;\" and then continuing the conversation, \"asked me whether I\r\nintended to take a house in the country this summer. I said, No....\r\n'And why so?' said he. I was hesitating upon an answer when he\r\nrelieved me from embarrassment by saying, 'Peut-être sont-ce des\r\nconsiderations de finance?' As he said it with perfect good humor and\r\nwith a smile, I replied in the same manner: 'Mais Sire, elles y sont\r\npour une bonne part.'\"[2]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2: An interesting sketch of his household\r\n                   and its expenses is to be found in ii. Diary, 193.]\r\n\r\nThe volume of the journal which records this residence in St. Petersburg\r\nis very interesting as a picture of Russian life and manners in high\r\nsociety. Few travellers write anything nearly so vivid, so         (p. 074)\r\nthorough, or so trustworthy as these entries. Moreover, during the\r\nwhole period of his stay the great wars of Napoleon were constantly\r\nincreasing the astonishment of mankind, and created intense excitement\r\nat the Court of Russia. These feelings waxed stronger as it grew daily\r\nmore likely that the Emperor would have to take his turn also as a\r\nparty defendant in the great conflict. Then at last came the fact of\r\nwar, the invasion of Russia, the burning of Moscow, the disastrous\r\nretreat of the invaders ending in ignominious flight, the advance of\r\nthe allies, finally the capture of Paris. All this while Mr. Adams at\r\nSt. Petersburg witnessed first the alarm and then the exultation of\r\nthe court and the people as the rumors now of defeat, anon of victory,\r\nwere brought by the couriers at tantalizing intervals; and he saw the\r\nrejoicings and illuminations which rendered the Russian capital so\r\nbrilliant and glorious during the last portion of his residence. It\r\nwas an experience well worth having, and which is pleasantly depicted\r\nin the Diary.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1812, Count Romanzoff suggested to Mr. Adams the\r\nreadiness of the Emperor to act as mediator in bringing about peace\r\nbetween the United States and England. The suggestion was promptly\r\nacted upon, but with no directly fortunate results. The American   (p. 075)\r\ngovernment acceded at once to the proposition, and at the risk of an\r\nimpolitic display of readiness dispatched Messrs. Gallatin and Bayard\r\nto act as Commissioners jointly with Mr. Adams in the negotiations.\r\nThese gentlemen, however, arrived in St. Petersburg only to find\r\nthemselves in a very awkward position. Their official character might\r\nnot properly be considered as attaching unless England should accept\r\nthe offer of mediation. But England had refused, in the first\r\ninstance, to do this, and she now again reiterated her refusal without\r\nregard for the manifestation of willingness on the part of the United\r\nStates. Further, Mr. Gallatin's nomination was rejected by the Senate\r\nafter his departure, on the ground that his retention of the post of\r\nSecretary of the Treasury was incompatible, under the Constitution,\r\nwith this diplomatic function. So the United States appeared in a very\r\nannoying attitude, her Commissioners were uncomfortable and somewhat\r\nhumiliated; Russia felt a certain measure of vexation at the brusque\r\nand positive rejection of her friendly proposition on the part of\r\nGreat Britain; and that country alone came out of the affair with any\r\nself-satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBut by the time when all hopes of peace through the friendly offices\r\nof Russia were at an end, that stage of the conflict had been      (p. 076)\r\nreached at which both parties were quite ready to desist. The United\r\nStates, though triumphing in some brilliant naval victories, had been\r\nhaving a sorry experience on land, where, as the Russian minister\r\nremarked, \"England did as she pleased.\" A large portion of the people\r\nwere extremely dissatisfied, and it was impossible to ignore that the\r\noutlook did not promise better fortunes in the future than had been\r\nencountered in the past. On the other hand, England had nothing\r\nsubstantial to expect from a continuance of the struggle, except heavy\r\nadditional expenditure which it was not then the fashion to compel the\r\nworsted party to recoup. She accordingly intimated her readiness to\r\nsend Commissioners to Göttingen, for which place Ghent was afterwards\r\nsubstituted, to meet American Commissioners and settle terms of\r\npacification. The United States renewed the powers of Messrs. Adams,\r\nBayard, and Gallatin, a new Secretary of the Treasury having in the\r\nmeantime been appointed, and added Jonathan Russell, then Minister to\r\nSweden, and Henry Clay. England deputed Lord Gambier, an admiral, Dr.\r\nAdams, a publicist, and Mr. Goulburn, a member of Parliament and Under\r\nSecretary of State. These eight gentlemen accordingly met in Ghent on\r\nAugust 7, 1814.\r\n\r\nIt was upwards of four months before an agreement was reached.     (p. 077)\r\nDuring this period Mr. Adams kept his Diary with much more even than\r\nhis wonted faithfulness, and it undoubtedly presents the most vivid\r\npicture in existence of the labors of treaty-making diplomatists. The\r\neight were certainly an odd assemblage of peacemakers. The ill-blood\r\nand wranglings between the opposing Commissions were bad enough, yet\r\nhardly equalled the intestine dissensions between the American\r\nCommissioners themselves. That the spirit of peace should ever have\r\nemanated from such an universal embroilment is almost sufficiently\r\nsurprising to be regarded as a miracle. At the very beginning, or even\r\nbefore fairly beginning, the British party roused the jealous ire of\r\nthe Americans by proposing that they all should meet, for exchanging\r\ntheir full powers, at the lodgings of the Englishmen. The Americans\r\ntook fire at this \"offensive pretension to superiority\" which was \"the\r\nusage from Ambassadors to Ministers of an inferior order.\" Mr. Adams\r\ncited Martens, and Mr. Bayard read a case from Ward's \"Law of Nations.\"\r\nMr. Adams suggested sending a pointed reply, agreeing to meet the\r\nBritish Commissioners \"at any place other than their own lodgings;\"\r\nbut Mr. Gallatin, whose valuable function was destined to be the\r\nkeeping of the peace among his fractious colleagues, as well as    (p. 078)\r\nbetwixt them and the Englishmen, substituted the milder phrase, \"at\r\nany place which may be mutually agreed upon.\" The first meeting\r\naccordingly took place at the Hôtel des Pays Bas, where it was\r\narranged that the subsequent conferences should be held alternately at\r\nthe quarters of the two Commissions. Then followed expressions,\r\nconventional and proper but wholly untrue, of mutual sentiments of\r\nesteem and good will.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did the gentlemen begin to get seriously at the work before\r\nthem than the most discouraging prospects were developed. The British\r\nfirst presented their demands, as follows: 1. That the United States\r\nshould conclude a peace with the Indian allies of Great Britain, and\r\nthat a species of neutral belt of Indian territory should be\r\nestablished between the dominions of the United States and Great\r\nBritain, so that these dominions should be nowhere conterminous, upon\r\nwhich belt or barrier neither power should be permitted to encroach\r\neven by purchase, and the boundaries of which should be settled in\r\nthis treaty. 2. That the United States should keep no naval force upon\r\nthe Great Lakes, and should neither maintain their existing forts nor\r\nbuild new ones upon their northern frontier; it was even required that\r\nthe boundary line should run along the southern shore of the       (p. 079)\r\nlakes; while no corresponding restriction was imposed upon Great\r\nBritain, because she was stated to have no projects of conquest as\r\nagainst her neighbor. 3. That a piece of the province of Maine should\r\nbe ceded, in order to give the English a road from Halifax to Quebec.\r\n4. That the stipulation of the treaty of 1783, conferring on English\r\nsubjects the right of navigating the Mississippi, should be now\r\nformally renewed.\r\n\r\nThe Americans were astounded; it seemed to them hardly worth while to\r\nhave come so far to listen to such propositions. Concerning the\r\nproposed Indian pacification they had not even any powers, the United\r\nStates being already busied in negotiating a treaty with the tribes as\r\nindependent powers. The establishment of the neutral Indian belt was\r\nmanifestly contrary to the established policy and obvious destiny of\r\nthe nation. Neither was the answer agreeable, which was returned by\r\nDr. Adams to the inquiry as to what was to be done with those citizens\r\nof the United States who had already settled in those parts of\r\nMichigan, Illinois, and Ohio, included within the territory which it\r\nwas now proposed to make inalienably Indian. He said that these\r\npeople, amounting perhaps to one hundred thousand, \"must shift for\r\nthemselves.\" The one-sided disarmament upon the lakes and along the\r\nfrontier was, by the understanding of all nations, such an         (p. 080)\r\nhumiliation as is inflicted only on a crushed adversary. No return was\r\noffered for the road between Halifax and Quebec; nor for the right of\r\nnavigating the Mississippi. The treaty of peace of 1783, made in\r\nignorance of the topography of the unexplored northern country, had\r\nestablished an impossible boundary line running from the Lake of the\r\nWoods westward along the forty-ninth parallel to the Mississippi; and\r\nas appurtenant to the British territory, thus supposed to touch the\r\nriver, a right of navigation upon it was given. It had since been\r\ndiscovered that a line on that parallel would never touch the\r\nMississippi. The same treaty had also secured for the United States\r\ncertain rights concerning the Northeastern fisheries. The English now\r\ninsisted upon a re-affirmance of the privilege given to them, without\r\na re-affirmance of the privilege given to the United States; ignoring\r\nthe fact that the recent acquisition of Louisiana, making the\r\nMississippi wholly American, materially altered the propriety of a\r\nBritish right of navigation upon it.\r\n\r\nApart from the intolerable character of these demands, the personal\r\nbearing of the English Commissioners did not tend to mitigate the\r\nchagrin of the Americans. The formal civilities had counted with the\r\nAmerican Commissioners for more than they were worth, and had      (p. 081)\r\ninduced them, in preparing a long dispatch to the home government,\r\nto insert \"a paragraph complimentary to the personal deportment\" of\r\nthe British. But before they sent off the document they revised it and\r\nstruck out these pleasant phrases. Not many days after the first\r\nconference Mr. Adams notes that the tone of the English Commissioners\r\nwas even \"more peremptory, and their language more overbearing, than\r\nat the former conferences.\" A little farther on he remarks that \"the\r\nBritish note is overbearing and insulting in its tone, like the two\r\nformer ones.\" Again he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The tone of all the British notes is arrogant, overbearing, and\r\n     offensive. The tone of ours is neither so bold nor so spirited as\r\n     I think it should be. It is too much on the defensive, and too\r\n     excessive in the caution to say nothing irritating. I have seldom\r\n     been able to prevail upon my colleagues to insert anything in the\r\n     style of retort upon the harsh and reproachful matter which we\r\n     receive.\"\r\n\r\nMany little passages-at-arms in the conferences are recited which\r\namply bear out these remarks as regards both parties. Perhaps,\r\nhowever, it should be admitted that the Americans made up for the\r\nself-restraint which they practised in conference by the disagreements\r\nand bickerings in which they indulged when consulting among        (p. 082)\r\nthemselves. Mr. Gallatin's serene temper and cool head were hardly\r\ntaxed to keep the peace among his excited colleagues. Mr. Adams and\r\nMr. Clay were especially prone to suspicions and to outbursts of\r\nanger. Mr. Adams often and candidly admits as much of himself,\r\napparently not without good reason. At first the onerous task of\r\ndrafting the numerous documents which the Commission had to present\r\ndevolved upon him, a labor for which he was well fitted in all\r\nrespects save, perhaps, a tendency to prolixity. He did not, however,\r\nsucceed in satisfying his comrades, and the criticisms to which they\r\nsubjected his composition galled his self-esteem severely, so much so\r\nthat erelong he altogether relinquished this function, which was\r\nthereafter performed chiefly by Mr. Gallatin. As early as August 21,\r\nMr. Adams says, not without evident bitterness, that though they all\r\nwere agreed on the general view of the subject, yet in his \"exposition\r\nof it, one objects to the form, another to the substance, of almost\r\nevery paragraph.\" Mr. Gallatin would strike out everything possibly\r\noffensive to the Englishmen; Mr. Clay would draw his pen through every\r\nfigurative expression; Mr. Russell, not content with agreeing to all\r\nthe objections of both the others, would further amend the construction\r\nof every sentence; and finally Mr. Bayard would insist upon        (p. 083)\r\nwriting all over again in his own language. All this nettled Mr. Adams\r\nexceedingly. On September 24 he again writes that it was agreed to\r\nadopt an article which he had drawn, \"though with objections to almost\r\nevery word\" which he had used. \"This,\" he says, \"is a severity with\r\nwhich I alone am treated in our discussions by all my colleagues.\r\nAlmost everything written by any of the rest is rejected, or agreed to\r\nwith very little criticism, verbal or substantial. But every line that\r\nI write passes a gauntlet of objections by every one of my colleagues,\r\nwhich finally issues, for the most part, in the rejection of it all.\"\r\nHe reflects, with a somewhat forced air of self-discipline, that this\r\nmust indicate some faultiness in his composition which he must try to\r\ncorrect; but in fact it is sufficiently evident that he was seldom\r\npersuaded that his papers were improved. Amid all this we see in the\r\nDiary many exhibitions of vexation. One day he acknowledges, \"I cannot\r\nalways restrain the irritability of my temper;\" another day he\r\ninformed his colleagues, \"with too much warmth, that they might be\r\nassured I was as determined as they were;\" again he reflects, \"I, too,\r\nmust not forget to keep a constant guard upon my temper, for the time\r\nis evidently approaching when it will be wanted.\" Mr. Gallatin alone\r\nseems not to have exasperated him; Mr. Clay and he were constantly (p. 084)\r\nin discussion, and often pretty hotly. Instead of coming nearer\r\ntogether, as time went on, these two fell farther apart. What Mr. Clay\r\nthought of Mr. Adams may probably be inferred from what we know that\r\nMr. Adams thought of Mr. Clay. \"Mr. Clay is losing his temper, and\r\ngrowing peevish and fractious,\" he writes on October 31; and constantly\r\nhe repeats the like complaint. The truth is, that the precise New\r\nEnglander and the impetuous Westerner were kept asunder not only by\r\nlocal interests but by habits and modes of thought utterly dissimilar.\r\nSome amusing glimpses of their private life illustrate this\r\ndifference. Mr. Adams worked hard and diligently, allowing himself\r\nlittle leisure for pleasure; but Mr. Clay, without actually neglecting\r\nhis duties, yet managed to find ample time for enjoyment. More than\r\nonce Mr. Adams notes that, as he rose about five o'clock in the\r\nmorning to light his own fire and begin the labors of the day by\r\ncandle-light, he heard the parties breaking up and leaving Mr. Clay's\r\nrooms across the entry, where they had been playing cards all night\r\nlong. In these little touches one sees the distinctive characters of\r\nthe men well portrayed.\r\n\r\nThe very extravagance of the British demands at least saved the    (p. 085)\r\nAmericans from perplexity. Mr. Clay, indeed, cherished an \"inconceivable\r\nidea\" that the Englishmen would \"finish by receding from the ground\r\nthey had taken;\" but meantime there could be no difference of opinion\r\nconcerning the impossibility of meeting them upon that ground. Mr.\r\nAdams, never lacking in courage, actually wished to argue with them\r\nthat it would be for the interests of Great Britain not less than of\r\nthe United States if Canada should be ceded to the latter power.\r\nUnfortunately his colleagues would not support him in this audacious\r\npolicy, the humor of which is delicious. It would have been infinitely\r\ndroll to see how the British Commissioners would have hailed such a\r\nproposition, by way of appropriate termination of a conflict in which\r\nthe forces of their nation had captured and ransacked the capital city\r\nof the Americans!\r\n\r\nOn August 21 the Englishmen invited the Americans to dinner on the\r\nfollowing Saturday. \"The chance is,\" wrote Mr. Adams, \"that before\r\nthat time the whole negotiation will be at an end.\" The banquet,\r\nhowever, did come off, and a few more succeeded it; feasts not marked\r\nby any great geniality or warmth, except perhaps occasionally warmth\r\nof discussion. So sure were the Americans that they were about to\r\nbreak off the negotiations that Mr. Adams began to consider by     (p. 086)\r\nwhat route he should return to St. Petersburg; and they declined to\r\nrenew the tenure of their quarters for more than a few days longer.\r\nLike alarms were of frequent occurrence, even almost to the very day\r\nof agreement. On September 15, at a dinner given by the American\r\nCommissioners, Lord Gambier asked Mr. Adams whether he would return\r\nimmediately to St. Petersburg. \"Yes,\" replied Mr. Adams, \"that is, if\r\nyou send us away.\" His lordship \"replied with assurances how deeply he\r\nlamented it, and with a hope that we should one day be friends again.\"\r\nOn the same occasion Mr. Goulburn said that probably the last note of\r\nthe Americans would \"terminate the business,\" and that they \"must\r\nfight it out.\" Fighting it out was a much less painful prospect for\r\nGreat Britain just at that juncture than for the United States, as the\r\nAmericans realized with profound anxiety. \"We so fondly cling to the\r\nvain hope of peace, that every new proof of its impossibility operates\r\nupon us as a disappointment,\" wrote Mr. Adams. No amount of pride\r\ncould altogether conceal the fact that the American Commissioners\r\nrepresented the worsted party, and though they never openly said so\r\neven among themselves, yet indirectly they were obliged to recognize\r\nthe truth. On November 10 we find Mr. Adams proposing to make      (p. 087)\r\nconcessions not permitted by their instructions, because, as he said:--\r\n\r\n     \"I felt so sure that [the home government] would now gladly take\r\n     the state before the war as the general basis of the peace, that\r\n     I was prepared to take on me the responsibility of trespassing\r\n     upon their instructions thus far. Not only so, but I would at\r\n     this moment cheerfully give my life for a peace on this basis. If\r\n     peace was possible, it would be on no other. I had indeed no hope\r\n     that the proposal would be accepted.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clay thought that the British would laugh at this: \"They would say,\r\nAy, ay! pretty fellows you, to think of getting out of the war as well\r\nas you got into it.\" This was not consoling for the representatives of\r\nthat side which had declared war for the purpose of curing grievances\r\nand vindicating alleged rights. But that Mr. Adams correctly read the\r\nwishes of the government was proved within a very few days by the\r\nreceipt of express authority from home \"to conclude the peace on the\r\nbasis of the _status ante bellum_.\" Three days afterwards, on November\r\n27, three and a half months after the vexatious haggling had been\r\nbegun, we encounter in the Diary the first real gleam of hope of a\r\nsuccessful termination: \"All the difficulties to the conclusion of a\r\npeace appear to be now so nearly removed, that my colleagues all   (p. 088)\r\nconsider it as certain. I myself think it probable.\"\r\n\r\nThere were, however, some three weeks more of negotiation to be gone\r\nthrough before the consummation was actually achieved, and the ill\r\nblood seemed to increase as the end was approached. The differences\r\nbetween the American Commissioners waxed especially serious concerning\r\nthe fisheries and the navigation of the Mississippi. Mr. Adams\r\ninsisted that if the treaty of peace had been so far abrogated by the\r\nwar as to render necessary a re-affirmance of the British right of\r\nnavigating the Mississippi, then a re-affirmance of the American\r\nrights in the Northeastern fisheries was equally necessary. This the\r\nEnglish Commissioners denied. Mr. Adams said it was only an exchange\r\nof privileges presumably equivalent. Mr. Clay, however, was firmly\r\nresolved to prevent all stipulations admitting such a right of\r\nnavigation, and the better to do so he was quite willing to let the\r\nfisheries go. The navigation privilege he considered \"much too\r\nimportant to be conceded for the mere liberty of drying fish upon a\r\ndesert,\" as he was pleased to describe a right for which the United\r\nStates has often been ready to go to war and may yet some time do so.\r\n\"Mr. Clay lost his temper,\" writes Mr. Adams a day or two later,   (p. 089)\r\n\"as he generally does whenever this right of the British to navigate\r\nthe Mississippi is discussed. He was utterly averse to admitting it as\r\nan equivalent for a stipulation securing the contested part of the\r\nfisheries. He said the more he heard of this [the right of fishing],\r\nthe more convinced he was that it was of little or no value. He should\r\nbe glad to get it if he could, but he was sure the British would not\r\nultimately grant it. That the navigation of the Mississippi, on the\r\nother hand, was an object of immense importance, and he could see no\r\nsort of reason for granting it as an equivalent for the fisheries.\"\r\nThus spoke the representative of the West. The New Englander--the son\r\nof the man whose exertions had been chiefly instrumental in originally\r\nobtaining the grant of the Northeastern fishery privileges--naturally\r\nwent to the other extreme. He thought \"the British right of navigating\r\nthe Mississippi to be as nothing, considered as a grant from us. It\r\nwas secured to them by the peace of 1783, they had enjoyed it at the\r\ncommencement of the war, it had never been injurious in the slightest\r\ndegree to our own people, and it appeared to [him] that the British\r\nclaim to it was just and equitable.\" Further he \"believed the right to\r\nthis navigation to be a very useless thing to the British.... But\r\ntheir national pride and honor were interested in it; the          (p. 090)\r\ngovernment could not make a peace which would abandon it.\" The\r\nfisheries, however, Mr. Adams regarded as one of the most inestimable\r\nand inalienable of American rights. It is evident that the United\r\nStates could ill have spared either Mr. Adams or Mr. Clay from the\r\nnegotiation, and the joinder of the two, however fraught with\r\ndiscomfort to themselves, well served substantial American interests.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams thought the British perfidious, and suspected them of not\r\nentertaining any honest intention of concluding a peace. On December\r\n12, after an exceedingly quarrelsome conference, he records his belief\r\nthat the British have \"insidiously kept open\" two points, \"for the\r\nsake of finally breaking off the negotiations and making all their\r\nother concessions proofs of their extreme moderation, to put upon us\r\nthe blame of the rupture.\"\r\n\r\nOn December 11 we find Mr. Clay ready \"for a war three years longer,\"\r\nand anxious \"to begin to play at _brag_\" with the Englishmen. His\r\ncolleagues, more complaisant or having less confidence in their own\r\nskill in that game, found it difficult to placate him; he \"stalked to\r\nand fro across the chamber, repeating five or six times, 'I will never\r\nsign a treaty upon the _status ante bellum_ with the Indian article.\r\nSo help me God!'\" The next day there was an angry controversy      (p. 091)\r\nwith the Englishmen. The British troops had taken and held Moose\r\nIsland in Passamaquoddy Bay, the rightful ownership of which was in\r\ndispute. The title was to be settled by arbitrators. But the question,\r\nwhether the British should restore possession of the island pending\r\nthe arbitration, aroused bitter discussion. \"Mr. Goulburn and Dr.\r\nAdams (the Englishman) immediately took fire, and Goulburn lost all\r\ncontrol of his temper. He has always in such cases,\" says the Diary,\r\n\"a sort of convulsive agitation about him, and the tone in which he\r\nspeaks is more insulting than the language which he uses.\" Mr. Bayard\r\nreferred to the case of the Falkland Islands. \"'Why' (in a transport\r\nof rage), said Goulburn, 'in that case we sent a fleet and troops and\r\ndrove the fellows off; and that is what we ought to have done in this\r\ncase.'\" Mr. J. Q. Adams, whose extensive and accurate information more\r\nthan once annoyed his adversaries, stated that, as he remembered it,\r\n\"the Spaniards in that case had driven the British off,\"--and Lord\r\nGambier helped his blundering colleague out of the difficulty by\r\nsuggesting a new subject, much as the defeated heroes of the Iliad\r\nused to find happy refuge from death in a god-sent cloud of dust. It\r\nis amusing to read that in the midst of such scenes as these the   (p. 092)\r\nshow of courtesy was still maintained; and on December 13 the\r\nAmericans \"all dined with the British Plenipotentiaries,\" though \"the\r\nparty was more than usually dull, stiff, and reserved.\" It was\r\ncertainly forcing the spirit of good fellowship. The next day Mr. Clay\r\nnotified his colleagues that they were going \"to make a damned bad\r\ntreaty, and he did not know whether he would sign it or not;\" and Mr.\r\nAdams also said that he saw that the rest had made up their minds \"at\r\nlast to yield the fishery point,\" in which case he also could not sign\r\nthe treaty. On the following day, however, the Americans were\r\nsurprised by receiving a note from the British Commissioners, wherein\r\nthey made the substantial concession of omitting from the treaty all\r\nreference to the fisheries and the navigation of the Mississippi. But\r\nMr. Clay, on reading the note, \"manifested some chagrin,\" and \"still\r\ntalked of breaking off the negotiation,\" even asking Mr. Adams to join\r\nhim in so doing, which request, however, Mr. Adams very reasonably\r\nrefused. Mr. Clay had also been anxious to stand out for a distinct\r\nabandonment of the alleged right of impressment; but upon this point\r\nhe found none of his colleagues ready to back him, and he was compelled\r\nperforce to yield. Agreement was therefore now substantially       (p. 093)\r\nreached; a few minor matters were settled, and on December 24, 1814,\r\nthe treaty was signed by all the eight negotiators.\r\n\r\nIt was an astonishing as well as a happy result. Never, probably, in\r\nthe history of diplomacy has concord been produced from such discordant\r\nelements as had been brought together in Ghent. Dissension seemed to\r\nhave become the mother of amity; and antipathies were mere\r\npreliminaries to a good understanding; in diplomacy as in marriage it\r\nhad worked well to begin with a little aversion. But, in truth, this\r\nconsummation was largely due to what had been going on in the English\r\nCabinet. At the outset Lord Castlereagh had been very unwilling to\r\nconclude peace, and his disposition had found expression in the\r\noriginal intolerable terms prepared by the British Commissioners. But\r\nLord Liverpool had been equally solicitous on the other side, and was\r\nsaid even to have tendered his resignation to the Prince Regent, if an\r\naccommodation should not be effected. His endeavors were fortunately\r\naided by events in Europe. Pending the negotiations Lord Castlereagh\r\nwent on a diplomatic errand to Vienna, and there fell into such\r\nthreatening discussions with the Emperor of Russia and the King of\r\nPrussia, that he thought it prudent to have done with the American (p. 094)\r\nwar, and wrote home pacific advices. Hence, at last, came such\r\nconcessions as satisfied the Americans.\r\n\r\nThe treaty established \"a firm and universal peace between his\r\nBritannic Majesty and the United States.\" Each party was to restore\r\nall captured territory, except that the islands of which the title was\r\nin dispute were to remain in the occupation of the party holding them\r\nat the time of ratification until that title should be settled by\r\ncommissioners; provision was made also for the determination of all\r\nthe open questions of boundary by sundry boards of commissioners; each\r\nparty was to make peace with the Indian allies of the other. Such\r\nwere, in substance, the only points touched upon by this document. Of\r\nthe many subjects mooted between the negotiators scarcely any had\r\nsurvived the fierce contests which had been waged concerning them. The\r\nwhole matter of the navigation of the Mississippi, access to that\r\nriver, and a road through American territory, had been dropped by the\r\nBritish; while the Americans had been well content to say nothing of\r\nthe Northeastern fisheries, which they regarded as still their own.\r\nThe disarmament on the lakes and along the Canadian border, and the\r\nneutralization of a strip of Indian territory, were yielded by the (p. 095)\r\nEnglish. The Americans were content to have nothing said about\r\nimpressment; nor was any one of the many illegal rights exercised by\r\nEngland formally abandoned. The Americans satisfied themselves with\r\nthe reflection that circumstances had rendered these points now only\r\nmatters of abstract principle, since the pacification of Europe had\r\nremoved all opportunities and temptations for England to persist in\r\nher previous objectionable courses. For the future it was hardly to be\r\nfeared that she would again undertake to pursue a policy against which\r\nit was evident that the United States were willing to conduct a\r\nserious war. There was, however, no provision for indemnification.\r\n\r\nUpon a fair consideration, it must be admitted that though the treaty\r\nwas silent upon all the points which the United States had made war\r\nfor the purpose of enforcing, yet the country had every reason to be\r\ngratified with the result of the negotiation. The five Commissioners\r\nhad done themselves ample credit. They had succeeded in agreeing with\r\neach other; they had avoided any fracture of a negotiation which, up\r\nto the very end, seemed almost daily on the verge of being broken off\r\nin anger; they had managed really to lose nothing, in spite of the\r\nfact that their side had had decidedly the worst of the struggle.  (p. 096)\r\nThey had negotiated much more successfully than the armies of their\r\ncountrymen had fought. The Marquis of Wellesley said, in the House of\r\nLords, that \"in his opinion the American Commissioners had shown a\r\nmost astonishing superiority over the British during the whole of the\r\ncorrespondence.\" One cannot help wishing that the battle of New Orleans\r\nhad taken place a little earlier, or that the negotiation had fallen a\r\nlittle later, so that news of that brilliant event could have reached\r\nthe ears of the insolent Englishmen at Ghent, who had for three months\r\nbeen enjoying the malicious pleasure of lending to the Americans\r\nEnglish newspapers containing accounts of American misfortunes. But\r\nthat fortunate battle was not fought until a few days after the eight\r\nCommissioners had signed their compact. It is an interesting\r\nillustration of the slowness of communication which our forefathers\r\nhad to endure, that the treaty crossed the Atlantic in a sailing ship\r\nin time to travel through much of the country simultaneously with the\r\nreport of this farewell victory. Two such good pieces of news coming\r\ntogether set the people wild with delight. Even on the dry pages of\r\nNiles's \"Weekly Register\" occurs the triumphant paragraph: \"Who would\r\nnot be an American? Long live the Republic! All hail! last asylum  (p. 097)\r\nof oppressed humanity! Peace is signed in the arms of victory!\" It was\r\nnatural that most of the ecstasy should be manifested concerning the\r\nmilitary triumph, and that the mass of the people should find more\r\npleasure in glorifying General Jackson than in exalting the Commissioners.\r\nThe value of their work, however, was well proved by the voice of\r\nGreat Britain. In the London \"Times\" of December 30 appeared a most\r\nangry tirade against the treaty, with bitter sneers at those who\r\ncalled the peace an \"honorable\" one. England, it was said, \"had\r\nattempted to force her principles on America, and had failed.\" Foreign\r\npowers would say that the English \"had retired from the combat with\r\nthe stripes yet bleeding on their backs,--with the recent defeats at\r\nPlattsburgh and on Lake Champlain unavenged.\" The most gloomy\r\nprognostications of further wars with America when her naval power\r\nshould have waxed much greater were indulged. The loss of prestige in\r\nEurope, \"the probable loss of our trans-Atlantic provinces,\" were\r\namong the results to be anticipated from this treaty into which the\r\nEnglish Commissioners had been beguiled by the Americans. These latter\r\nwere reviled with an abuse which was really the highest compliment. The\r\nfamily name of Mr. Adams gained no small access of distinction in  (p. 098)\r\nEngland from this business.\r\n\r\nAfter the conclusion of the treaty Mr. Adams went to Paris, and\r\nremained there until the middle of May, 1815, thus having the good\r\nfortune to witness the return of Napoleon and a great part of the\r\nevents of the famous \"hundred days.\" On May 26 he arrived in London,\r\nwhere there awaited him, in the hands of the Barings, his commission\r\nas Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Great Britain.\r\nHis first duty was, in connection with Mr. Clay and Mr. Gallatin, to\r\nnegotiate a treaty of commerce, in which business he again met the\r\nsame three British Commissioners by whom the negotiations at Ghent had\r\nbeen conducted, of whose abilities the government appeared to\r\nentertain a better opinion than the Marquis of Wellesley had\r\nexpressed. This negotiation had been brought so far towards conclusion\r\nby his colleagues before his own arrival that Mr. Adams had little to\r\ndo in assisting them to complete it. This little having been done,\r\nthey departed and left him as Minister at the Court of St. James. Thus\r\nhe fulfilled Washington's prophecy, by reaching the highest rank in\r\nthe American diplomatic service.\r\n\r\nOf his stay in Great Britain little need be said. He had few duties of\r\nimportance to perform. The fisheries, the right of impressment,    (p. 099)\r\nand the taking away and selling of slaves by British naval officers\r\nduring the late war, formed the subjects of many interviews between\r\nhim and Lord Castlereagh, without, however, any definite results being\r\nreached. But he succeeded in obtaining, towards the close of his stay,\r\nsome slight remission of the severe restrictions placed by England\r\nupon our trade with her West Indian colonies. His relations with a\r\ncabinet in which the principles of Castlereagh and Canning\r\npredominated could hardly be cordial, yet he seems to have been\r\ntreated with perfect civility. Indeed, he was not a man whom it was\r\neasy even for an Englishman to insult. He remarks of Castlereagh,\r\nafter one of his first interviews with that nobleman: \"His deportment\r\nis sufficiently graceful, and his person is handsome. His manner was\r\ncold, but not absolutely repulsive.\" Before he left he had the\r\npleasure of having Mr. Canning specially seek acquaintance with him.\r\nHe met, of course, many distinguished and many agreeable persons\r\nduring his residence, and partook of many festivities, especially of\r\nnumerous civic banquets at which toasts were formally given in the\r\ndullest English fashion and he was obliged to display his capacity for\r\n\"table-cloth oratory,\" as he called it, more than was agreeable to\r\nhim. He was greatly bored by these solemn and pompous feedings.    (p. 100)\r\nPartly in order to escape them he took a house at Ealing, and lived\r\nthere during the greater part of his stay in England. \"One of the\r\nstrongest reasons for my remaining out of town,\" he writes, \"is to\r\nescape the frequency of invitations at late hours, which consume so\r\nmuch precious time, and with the perpetually mortifying consciousness\r\nof inability to return the civility in the same manner.\" The\r\nrepublican simplicity, not to say poverty, forced upon American\r\nrepresentatives abroad, was a very different matter in the censorious\r\nand unfriendly society of London from what it had been at the kindly\r\ndisposed Court of St. Petersburg. The relationship between the mother\r\ncountry and the quondam colonies, especially at that juncture, was\r\nsuch as to render social life intolerably trying to an under-paid\r\nAmerican minister.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams remained in England until June 15, 1817, when he sailed from\r\nCowes, closing forever his long and honorable diplomatic career, and\r\nbidding his last farewell to Europe. He returned home to take the post\r\nof Secretary of State in the cabinet of James Monroe, then lately\r\ninaugurated as President of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II                                                         (p. 101)\r\n\r\nSECRETARY OF STATE AND PRESIDENT\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the capitals of Russia and Great Britain to the capital of the\r\nUnited States was a striking change. Washington, in its early struggle\r\nfor existence, was so unattractive a spot, that foreigners must have\r\nbeen at a loss to discover the principle which had governed the\r\nselection. It combined all the ugliness with all the discomfort of an\r\nunprosperous frontier settlement on an ill-chosen site. What must\r\nEuropean diplomats have thought of a capital city where snakes two\r\nfeet long invaded gentlemen's drawing-rooms, and a carriage, bringing\r\nhome the guests from a ball, could be upset by the impenetrable depth\r\nof quagmire at the very door of a foreign minister's residence. A\r\ndescription of the city given by Mr. Mills, a Representative from\r\nMassachusetts, in 1815, is pathetic in its unutterable horror:--\r\n\r\n     \"It is impossible [he writes] for me to describe to you my\r\n     feelings on entering this miserable desert, this scene of\r\n     desolation and horror.... My anticipations were almost        (p. 102)\r\n     infinitely short of the reality, and I can truly say that the\r\n     first appearance of this seat of the national government has\r\n     produced in me nothing but absolute loathing and disgust.\"\r\n\r\nIf the place wore such a dreadful aspect to the simple denizen of a\r\nNew England country town, what must it have seemed to those who were\r\nfamiliar with London and Paris? To them the social life must have been\r\nscarcely less dreary than the rest of the surroundings. Accordingly,\r\nwith this change of scene, the Diary, so long a record of festivities\r\nsometimes dull and formal, but generally collecting interesting and\r\ndistinguished persons, ceases almost wholly to refer to topics of\r\nsociety. Yet, of course, even the foul streets could not prevent\r\npeople from occasionally meeting together. There were simple\r\ntea-drinkings, stupid weekly dinners at the President's, infrequent\r\nreceptions by Mrs. Monroe, card-parties and conversation-parties,\r\nwhich at the British minister's were very \"elegant,\" and at the French\r\nminister's were more gay. Mons. de Neuville, at his dinners, used to\r\npuzzle and astound the plain-living Yankees by serving dishes of\r\n\"turkeys without bones, and puddings in the form of fowls, fresh cod\r\ndisguised like a salad, and celery like oysters;\" further, he\r\nscandalized some and demoralized others by having dancing on       (p. 103)\r\nSaturday evenings, which the New England ladies had been \"educated to\r\nconsider as holy time.\" Mr. and Mrs. Adams used to give weekly parties\r\non Tuesday evenings, and apparently many persons stood not a little in\r\nawe of these entertainments and of the givers of them, by reason of\r\ntheir superior familiarity with the manners and customs of the best\r\nsociety of Europe. Mrs. Adams was, \"on the whole, a very pleasant and\r\nagreeable woman; but the Secretary [had] no talent to entertain a\r\nmixed company, either by conversation or manners;\" thus writes this\r\nsame Mr. Mills, whose sentiments towards Mr. Adams were those of\r\nrespect rather than of personal liking. The favorite dissipation then\r\nconsisted in card-playing, and the stakes were too often out of all\r\njust proportion to the assets of the gamesters. At one time Mr. Clay\r\nwas reputed to have lost $8,000, an amount so considerable for him as\r\nto weigh upon his mind to the manifest detriment of his public\r\nfunctions. But sometimes the gentlemen resident in the capital met for\r\npurposes less innocent than Saturday evening cotillons, or even than\r\nextravagant betting at the card-table, and stirred the dulness of\r\nsociety by a duel. Mr. Adams tells of one affair of this sort, fought\r\nbetween ex-Senator Mason, of Virginia, and his cousin, wherein the\r\nweapons used were muskets, and the distance was only six paces.    (p. 104)\r\nMason was killed; his cousin was wounded, and only by a lucky\r\naccident escaped with his life. Mr. Adams had little time and less\r\ntaste for either the amusements or the dangers thus offered to him; he\r\npreferred to go to bed in good season, to get up often long before\r\ndaybreak, and to labor assiduously the livelong day. His favorite\r\nexercise was swimming in the Potomac, where he accomplished feats\r\nwhich would have been extraordinary for a young and athletic man.\r\n\r\nThe most important, perplexing, and time-consuming duties then called\r\nfor by the condition of public affairs happened to fall within Mr.\r\nAdams's department. Monroe's administration has been christened the\r\n\"era of good feeling;\" and, so far as political divisions among the\r\npeople at large were concerned, this description is correct enough.\r\nThere were no great questions of public policy dividing the nation.\r\nThere could hardly be said to be two political parties. With the close\r\nof the war the malcontent Federalists had lost the only substantial\r\nprinciple upon which they had been able vigorously to oppose the\r\nadministration, and as a natural consequence the party rapidly shrank\r\nto insignificant proportions, and became of hardly more importance\r\nthan were the Jacobites in England after their last hopes had      (p. 105)\r\nbeen quenched by the failure of the Rebellion of '45. The Federalist\r\nfaith, like Jacobitism, lingered in a few neighborhoods, and was\r\nmaintained by a few old families, who managed to associate it with a\r\nsense of their own pride and dignity; but as an effective opposition\r\nor influential party organization it was effete, and no successor was\r\nrising out of its ruins. In a broad way, therefore, there was\r\npolitical harmony to a very remarkable degree.\r\n\r\nBut among individuals there was by no means a prevailing good feeling.\r\nNot held together by the pressure exerted by the antagonism of a\r\nstrong hostile force, the prominent men of the Cabinet and in Congress\r\nwere busily employed in promoting their own individual interests.\r\nHaving no great issues with which to identify themselves, and upon\r\nwhich they could openly and honorably contend for the approval of the\r\nnation, their only means for securing their respective private ends\r\nlay in secretly overreaching and supplanting each other. Infinite\r\nskill was exerted by each to inveigle his rival into an unpopular\r\nposition or a compromising light. By a series of precedents Mr. Adams,\r\nas Secretary of State, appeared most prominent as a candidate for the\r\nsuccession to the Presidency. But Mr. Crawford, in the Treasury\r\nDepartment, had been very near obtaining the nomination instead    (p. 106)\r\nof Monroe, and he was firmly resolved to secure it so soon as Mr.\r\nMonroe's eight years should have elapsed. He, therefore, finding much\r\nleisure left upon his hands by the not very exacting business of his\r\noffice, devoted his ingenuity to devising schemes for injuring the\r\nprestige of Mr. Adams. Mr. Clay also had been greatly disappointed\r\nthat he had not been summoned to be Secretary of State, and so made\r\nheir apparent. His personal enmity was naturally towards Mr. Monroe;\r\nhis political enmity necessarily also included Mr. Adams, whose\r\nappointment he had privately sought to prevent. He therefore at once\r\nset himself assiduously to oppose and thwart the administration, and\r\nto make it unsuccessful and unpopular. That Clay was in the main and\r\nupon all weighty questions an honest statesman and a real patriot must\r\nbe admitted, but just at this period no national crisis called his\r\nnobler qualities into action, and his course was largely influenced by\r\nselfish considerations. It was not long before Mr. Calhoun also\r\nentered the lists, though in a manner less discreditable to himself,\r\npersonally, than were the resources of Crawford and Clay. The daily\r\nnarrations and comments of Mr. Adams display and explain in a manner\r\nhighly instructive, if not altogether agreeable, the ambitions     (p. 107)\r\nand the manoeuvres, the hollow alliances and unworthy intrigues, not\r\nonly of these three, but also of many other estimable gentlemen then\r\nin political life. The difference between those days and our own seems\r\nnot so great as the _laudatores temporis acti_ are wont to proclaim\r\nit. The elaborate machinery which has since been constructed was then\r\nunknown; rivals relied chiefly upon their own astuteness and the aid\r\nof a few personal friends and adherents for carrying on contests and\r\nattaining ends which are now sought by vastly more complex methods.\r\nWhat the stage-coach of that period was to the railroads of to-day, or\r\nwhat the hand-loom was to our great cotton mills, such also was the\r\npolitical intriguing of cabinet ministers, senators, and\r\nrepresentatives to our present party machinery. But the temper was no\r\nbetter, honor was no keener, the sense of public duty was little more\r\ndisinterested then than now. One finds no serious traces of vulgar\r\nfinancial dishonesty recorded in these pages, in which Mr. Adams has\r\nhanded down the political life of the second and third decades of our\r\ncentury with a photographic accuracy. But one does not see a much\r\nhigher level of faithfulness to ideal standards in political life than\r\nnow exists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wm. H. Crawford.]\r\n\r\nAs has been said, it so happened that in Mr. Monroe's              (p. 108)\r\nadministration the heaviest burden of labor and responsibility rested\r\nupon Mr. Adams; the most important and most perplexing questions fell\r\nwithin his department. Domestic breaches had been healed, but foreign\r\nbreaches gaped with threatening jaws. War with Spain seemed imminent.\r\nHer South American colonies were then waging their contest for\r\nindependence, and naturally looked to the late successful rebels of\r\nthe northern continent for acts of neighborly sympathy and good\r\nfellowship. Their efforts to obtain official recognition and the\r\nexchange of ministers with the United States were eager and persistent.\r\nPrivateers fitted out at Baltimore gave the State Department scarcely\r\nless cause for anxiety than the shipbuilders of Liverpool gave to the\r\nEnglish Cabinet in 1863-64. These perplexities, as is well known,\r\ncaused the passage of the first \"Neutrality Act,\" which first\r\nformulated and has since served to establish the principle of\r\ninternational obligation in such matters, and has been the basis of\r\nall subsequent legislation upon the subject not only in this country\r\nbut also in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe European powers, impelled by a natural distaste for rebellion by\r\ncolonists, and also believing that Spain would in time prevail over\r\nthe insurgents, turned a deaf ear to South American agents. But in the\r\nUnited States it was different. Here it was anticipated that the   (p. 109)\r\nrevolted communities were destined to win; Mr. Adams records this as\r\nhis own opinion; besides which there was also a natural sympathy felt\r\nby our people in such a conflict in their own quarter of the globe.\r\nNevertheless, in many anxious cabinet discussions, the President and\r\nthe Secretary of State established the policy of reserve and caution.\r\nRebels against an established government are like plaintiffs in\r\nlitigation; the burden of proof is upon them, and the neutral nations\r\nwho are a sort of quasi-jurors must not commit themselves to a\r\ndecision prematurely. The grave and inevitable difficulties besetting\r\nthe administration in this matter were seriously enhanced by the\r\nconduct of Mr. Clay. Seeking nothing so eagerly as an opportunity to\r\nharass the government, he could have found none more to his taste than\r\nthis question of South American recognition. His enthusiastic and\r\nrhetorical temperament rejoiced in such a topic for his luxuriant\r\noratory, and he lauded freedom and abused the administration with a\r\nforce of expression far from gratifying to the responsible heads of\r\ngovernment in their troublesome task.\r\n\r\nApart from these matters the United States had direct disputes of a\r\nthreatening character pending with Spain concerning the boundaries of\r\nLouisiana. Naturally enough boundary lines in the half explored    (p. 110)\r\nwilderness of this vast continent were not then marked with that\r\nindisputable accuracy which many generations and much bloodshed had\r\nachieved in Europe; and of all uncertain boundaries that of Louisiana\r\nwas the most so. Area enough to make two or three States, more or\r\nless, might or might not be included therein. Such doubts had proved a\r\nready source of quarrel, which could hardly be assuaged by General\r\nJackson marching about in unquestionable Spanish territory, seizing\r\ntowns and hanging people after his lawless, ignorant, energetic\r\nfashion. Mr. Adams's chief labor, therefore, was by no means of a\r\npromising character, being nothing less difficult than to conclude a\r\ntreaty between enraged Spain and the rapacious United States, where\r\nthere was so much wrong and so much right on both sides, and such a\r\nwide obscure realm of doubt between the two that an amicable agreement\r\nmight well seem not only beyond expectation but beyond hope.\r\n\r\nMany and various also were the incidental obstacles in Mr. Adams's\r\nway. Not the least lay in the ability of Don Onis, the Spanish\r\nMinister, an ambassador well selected for his important task and whom\r\nthe American thus described:--\r\n\r\n     \"Cold, calculating, wily, always commanding his own temper,   (p. 111)\r\n     proud because he is a Spaniard, but supple and cunning,\r\n     accommodating the tone of his pretensions precisely to the degree\r\n     of endurance of his opponent, bold and overbearing to the utmost\r\n     extent to which it is tolerated, careless of what he asserts or\r\n     how grossly it is proved to be unfounded, his morality appears to\r\n     be that of the Jesuits as exposed by Pascal. He is laborious,\r\n     vigilant, and ever attentive to his duties; a man of business and\r\n     of the world.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately this so dangerous negotiator was hardly less anxious than\r\nMr. Adams to conclude a treaty. Yet he, too, had his grave difficulties\r\nto encounter. Spanish arrogance had not declined with the decline of\r\nSpanish strength, and the concessions demanded from that ancient\r\nmonarchy by the upstart republic seemed at once exasperating and\r\nhumiliating. The career of Jackson in Florida, while it exposed the\r\nweakness of Spain, also sorely wounded her pride. Nor could the\r\ngrandees, three thousand miles away, form so accurate an opinion of\r\nthe true condition and prospects of affairs as could Don Onis upon\r\nthis side of the water. One day, begging Mr. Adams to meet him upon a\r\nquestion of boundary, \"he insisted much upon the infinite pains he had\r\ntaken to prevail upon his government to come to terms of accommodation,\"\r\nand pathetically declared that \"the King's Council was composed    (p. 112)\r\nof such ignorant and stupid _nigauds_, grandees of Spain, and priests,\"\r\nthat Mr. Adams \"could have no conception of their obstinacy and\r\nimbecility.\"\r\n\r\nOther difficulties in Mr. Adams's way were such as ought not to have\r\nbeen encountered. The only substantial concession which he was willing\r\nto make was in accepting the Sabine instead of the Rio del Norte as\r\nthe southwestern boundary of Louisiana. But no sooner did rumors of\r\nthis possible yielding get abroad than he was notified that Mr. Clay\r\n\"would take ground against\" any treaty embodying it. From Mr. Crawford\r\na more dangerous and insidious policy was to be feared. Presumably he\r\nwould be well pleased either to see Mr. Adams fail altogether in the\r\nnegotiation, or to see him conclude a treaty which would be in some\r\nessential feature odious to the people.\r\n\r\n     \"That all his conduct [wrote Mr. Adams] is governed by his views\r\n     to the Presidency, as the ultimate successor to Mr. Monroe, and\r\n     that his hopes depend upon a result unfavorable to the success or\r\n     at least to the popularity of the Administration, is perfectly\r\n     clear.... His talent is intrigue. And as it is in the foreign\r\n     affairs that the success or failure of the Administration will be\r\n     most conspicuous, and as their success would promote the\r\n     reputation and influence, and their failure would lead to     (p. 113)\r\n     the disgrace of the Secretary of State, Crawford's personal\r\n     views centre in the ill-success of the Administration in its\r\n     foreign relations; and, perhaps unconscious of his own motives,\r\n     he will always be impelled to throw obstacles in its way, and to\r\n     bring upon the Department of State especially any feeling of\r\n     public dissatisfaction that he can, ... and although himself a\r\n     member of the Administration, he perceives every day more clearly\r\n     that his only prospect of success hereafter depends upon the\r\n     failure of the Administration by measures of which he must take\r\n     care to make known his disapprobation.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Monroe was profoundly anxious for the consummation of the\r\ntreaty, and though for a time he was in perfect accord with Mr. Adams,\r\nyet as the Spanish minister gradually drew nearer and nearer to a full\r\ncompliance with the American demands, Monroe began to fear that the\r\nSecretary would carry his unyielding habit too far, and by insistence\r\nupon extreme points which might well enough be given up, would allow\r\nthe country to drift into war.\r\n\r\nFortunately, as it turned out, Mr. Adams was not afraid to take the\r\nwhole responsibility of success or failure upon his own shoulders,\r\nshowing indeed a high and admirable courage and constancy amid such\r\ngrave perplexities, in which it seemed that all his future political\r\nfortunes were involved. He caused the proffered mediation of       (p. 114)\r\nGreat Britain to be rejected. He availed himself of no aid save only\r\nthe services of Mons. de Neuville, the French minister, who took a\r\nwarm interest in the negotiation, expostulated and argued constantly\r\nwith Don Onis and sometimes with Mr. Adams, served as a channel of\r\ncommunication and carried messages, propositions, and denials, which\r\ncould better come filtered through a neutral go-between than pass\r\ndirect from principal to principal. In fact, Mr. Adams needed no other\r\nkind of aid except just this which was so readily furnished by the\r\ncivil and obliging Frenchman. As if he had been a mathematician\r\nsolving a problem in dynamics, he seemed to have measured the precise\r\nline to which the severe pressure of Spanish difficulties would compel\r\nDon Onis to advance. This line he drew sharply, and taking his stand\r\nupon it in the beginning he made no important alterations in it to the\r\nend. Day by day the Spaniard would reluctantly approach toward him at\r\none point or another, solemnly protesting that he could not make\r\nanother move, by argument and entreaty urging, almost imploring, Mr.\r\nAdams in turn to advance and meet him. But Mr. Adams stood rigidly\r\nstill, sometimes not a little vexed by the other's lingering manoeuvres,\r\nand actually once saying to the courtly Spaniard that he \"was so   (p. 115)\r\nwearied out with the discussion that it had become nauseous;\" and,\r\nagain, that he \"really could discuss no longer, and had given it up in\r\ndespair.\" Yet all the while he was never wholly free from anxiety\r\nconcerning the accuracy of his calculations as to how soon the Don\r\nmight on his side also come to a final stand. Many a tedious and\r\nalarming pause there was, but after each halt progress was in time\r\nrenewed. At last the consummation was reached, and except in the\r\naforementioned matter of the Sabine boundary no concession even in\r\ndetails had been made by Mr. Adams. The United States was to receive\r\nFlorida, and in return only agreed to settle the disputed claims of\r\ncertain of her citizens against Spain to an amount not to exceed five\r\nmillion dollars; while the claims of Spanish subjects against the\r\nUnited States were wholly expunged. The western boundary was so\r\nestablished as to secure for this country the much-coveted outlet to\r\nthe shores of the \"South Sea,\" as the Pacific Ocean was called, south\r\nof the Columbia River; the line also was run along the southern banks\r\nof the Red and Arkansas rivers, leaving all the islands to the United\r\nStates and precluding Spain from the right of navigation. Mr. Adams\r\nhad achieved a great triumph.\r\n\r\nOn February 22, 1819, the two negotiators signed and sealed the    (p. 116)\r\ncounterparts of the treaty. Mr. Adams notes that it is \"perhaps\r\nthe most important day of my life,\" and justly called it \"a great\r\nepoch in our history.\" Yet on the next day the \"Washington City\r\nGazette\" came out with a strong condemnation of the Sabine concession,\r\nand expressed the hope that the Senate would not agree to it. \"This\r\nparagraph,\" said Mr. Adams, \"comes directly or indirectly from Mr.\r\nClay.\" But the paragraph did no harm, for on the following day the\r\ntreaty was confirmed by an unanimous vote of the Senate.\r\n\r\nIt was not long, however, before the pleasure justly derivable from\r\nthe completion of this great labor was cruelly dashed. It appeared\r\nthat certain enormous grants of land, made by the Spanish king to\r\nthree of his nobles, and which were supposed to be annulled by the\r\ntreaty, so that the territory covered by them would become the public\r\nproperty of the United States, bore date earlier than had been\r\nunderstood, and for this reason would, by the terms of the treaty, be\r\nleft in full force. This was a serious matter, and such steps as were\r\nstill possible to set it right were promptly taken. Mr. Adams appealed\r\nto Don Onis to state in writing that he himself had understood that\r\nthese grants were to be annulled, and that such had been the intention\r\nof the treaty. The Spaniard replied in a shape imperfectly         (p. 117)\r\nsatisfactory. He shuffled, evaded, and laid himself open to suspicion\r\nof unfair dealing, though the charge could not be regarded as fully\r\nproved against him. Mr. Adams, while blaming himself for carelessness\r\nin not having more closely examined original documents, yet felt\r\n\"scarce a doubt\" that Onis \"did intend by artifice to cover the grants\r\nwhile we were under the undoubting impression they were annulled;\" and\r\nhe said to M. de Neuville, concerning this dark transaction, that \"it\r\nwas not the ingenious device of a public minister, but '_une fourberie\r\nde Scapin_.'\" Before long the rumor got abroad in the public prints in\r\nthe natural shape of a \"malignant distortion,\" and Mr. Adams was\r\ncompelled to see with chagrin his supposed brilliant success\r\nthreatening to turn actually to his grave discredit by reason of this\r\nunfortunate oversight.\r\n\r\nWhat might have been the result had the treaty been ratified by Spain\r\ncan only be surmised. But it so befell--happily enough for the United\r\nStates and for Mr. Adams, as it afterwards turned out--that the\r\nSpanish government refused to ratify. The news was, however, that they\r\nwould forthwith dispatch a new minister to explain this refusal and to\r\nrenew negotiations.\r\n\r\nFor his own private part Mr. Adams strove to endure this buffet    (p. 118)\r\nof unkindly fortune with that unflinching and stubborn temper,\r\nslightly dashed with bitterness, which stood him in good stead in many\r\na political trial during his hard-fighting career. But in his official\r\ncapacity he had also to consider and advise what it behooved the\r\nadministration to do under the circumstances. The feeling was\r\nwidespread that the United States ought to possess Florida, and that\r\nSpain had paltered with us long enough. More than once in cabinet\r\nmeetings during the negotiation the Secretary of State, who was always\r\nprone to strong measures, had expressed a wish for an act of Congress\r\nauthorizing the Executive to take forcible possession of Florida and\r\nof Galveston in the event of Spain refusing to satisfy the reasonable\r\ndemands made upon her. Now, stimulated by indignant feeling, his\r\nprepossession in favor of vigorous action was greatly strengthened,\r\nand his counsel was that the United States should prepare at once to\r\ntake and hold the disputed territory, and indeed some undisputed\r\nSpanish territory also. But Mr. Monroe and the rest of the Cabinet\r\npreferred a milder course; and France and Great Britain ventured to\r\nexpress to this country a hope that no violent action would be\r\nprecipitately taken. So the matter lay by for a while, awaiting the\r\ncoming of the promised envoy from Spain.\r\n\r\nAt this time the great question of the admission of Missouri into  (p. 119)\r\nthe Union of States began to agitate Congress and the nation. Mr.\r\nAdams, deeply absorbed in the perplexing affairs of his department,\r\ninto which this domestic problem did not enter, was at first careless\r\nof it. His ideas concerning the matter, he wrote, were a \"chaos;\" but\r\nit was a \"chaos\" into which his interest in public questions soon\r\ncompelled him to bring order. In so doing he for the first time fairly\r\nexposes his intense repulsion for slavery, his full appreciation of\r\nthe irrepressible character of the conflict between the slave and the\r\nfree populations, and the sure tendency of that conflict to a\r\ndissolution of the Union. Few men at that day read the future so\r\nclearly. While dissolution was generally regarded as a threat not\r\nreally intended to be carried out, and compromises were supposed to be\r\namply sufficient to control the successive emergencies, the underlying\r\nmoral force of the anti-slavery movement acting against the\r\nencroaching necessities of the slave-holding communities constituted\r\nan element and involved possibilities which Mr. Adams, from his\r\nposition of observation outside the immediate controversy, noted with\r\nforeseeing accuracy. He discerned in passing events the \"title-page to\r\na great tragic volume;\" and he predicted that the more or less distant\r\nbut sure end must be an attempt to dissolve the Union. His own     (p. 120)\r\nposition was distinctly defined from the outset, and his strong\r\nfeelings were vigorously expressed. He beheld with profound regret the\r\nsuperiority of the slave-holding party in ability; he remarked sadly\r\nhow greatly they excelled in debating power their lukewarm opponents;\r\nhe was filled with indignation against the Northern men of Southern\r\nprinciples. \"Slavery,\" he wrote, \"is the great and foul stain upon the\r\nNorth American Union, and it is a contemplation worthy of the most\r\nexalted soul whether its total abolition is or is not practicable.\" \"A\r\nlife devoted to\" the emancipation problem \"would be nobly spent or\r\nsacrificed.\" He talks with much acerbity of expression about the\r\n\"slave-drivers,\" and the \"flagrant image of human inconsistency\"\r\npresented by men who had \"the Declaration of Independence on their\r\nlips and the merciless scourge of slavery in their hands.\" \"Never,\" he\r\nsays, \"since human sentiments and human conduct were influenced by\r\nhuman speech was there a theme for eloquence like the free side of\r\nthis question.... Oh, if but one man could arise with a genius capable\r\nof comprehending, and an utterance capable of communicating those\r\neternal truths that belong to this question, to lay bare in all its\r\nnakedness that outrage upon the goodness of God, human slavery;    (p. 121)\r\nnow is the time and this is the occasion, upon which such a man would\r\nperform the duties of an angel upon earth.\" Before the Abolitionists\r\nhad begun to preach their great crusade this was strong and ardent\r\nlanguage for a statesman's pen. Nor were these exceptional passages;\r\nthere is much more of the same sort at least equally forcible. Mr.\r\nAdams notes an interesting remark made to him by Calhoun at this time.\r\nThe great Southern chief, less prescient than Mr. Adams, declared that\r\nhe did not think that the slavery question \"would produce a\r\ndissolution of the Union; but if it should, the South would be from\r\nnecessity compelled to form an alliance offensive and defensive with\r\nGreat Britain.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning a suggestion that civil war might be preferable to the\r\nextension of slavery beyond the Mississippi, Adams said: \"This is a\r\nquestion between the rights of human nature and the Constitution of\r\nthe United States\"--a form of stating the case which leaves no doubt\r\nconcerning his ideas of the intrinsic right and wrong in the matter.\r\nHis own notion was that slavery could not be got rid of within the\r\nUnion, but that the only method would be dissolution, after which he\r\ntrusted that the course of events would in time surely lead to\r\nreorganization upon the basis of universal freedom for all. He     (p. 122)\r\nwas not a disunionist in any sense, yet it is evident that his strong\r\ntendency and inclination were to regard emancipation as a weight in\r\nthe scales heavier than union, if it should ever come to the point of\r\nan option between the two.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough the notion of a forcible retention of the slave\r\nStates within the Union does not seem to have been at this time a\r\nsubstantial element of consideration. Mr. Adams acknowledged that\r\nthere was no way at once of preserving the Union and escaping from the\r\npresent emergency save through the door of compromise. He maintained\r\nstrenuously the power of Congress to prohibit slavery in the\r\nTerritories, and denied that either Congress or a state government\r\ncould establish slavery as a new institution in any State in which it\r\nwas not already existing and recognized by law.\r\n\r\nThis agitation of the slavery question made itself felt in a way\r\npersonally interesting to Mr. Adams, by the influence it was exerting\r\nupon men's feelings concerning the still pending and dubious treaty\r\nwith Spain. The South became anxious to lay hands upon the Floridas\r\nand upon as far-reaching an area as possible in the direction of\r\nMexico, in order to carve it up into more slave States; the North, on\r\nthe other hand, no longer cared very eagerly for an extension of the\r\nUnion upon its southern side. Sectional interests were getting to  (p. 123)\r\nbe more considered than national. Mr. Adams could not but recognize\r\nthat in the great race for the Presidency, in which he could hardly\r\nhelp being a competitor, the chief advantage which he seemed to have\r\nwon when the Senate unanimously ratified the Spanish treaty, had\r\nalmost wholly vanished since that treaty had been repudiated by Spain\r\nand was now no longer desired by a large proportion of his own\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nMatters stood thus when the new Spanish envoy, Vivês, arrived. Other\r\nelements, which there is not space to enumerate here, besides those\r\nreferred to, now entering newly into the state of affairs, further\r\nreduced the improbability of agreement almost to hopelessness. Mr.\r\nAdams, despairing of any other solution than a forcible seizure of\r\nFlorida, to which he had long been far from averse, now visibly\r\nrelaxed his efforts to meet the Spanish negotiator. Perhaps no other\r\ncourse could have been more effectual in securing success than this\r\nobvious indifference to it. In the prevalent condition of public\r\nfeeling and of his own sentiments Mr. Adams easily assumed towards\r\nGeneral Vivês a decisive bluntness, not altogether consonant to the\r\nhabits of diplomacy, and manifested an unchangeable stubbornness which\r\nleft no room for discussion. His position was simply that Spain might\r\nmake such a treaty as the United States demanded, or might take    (p. 124)\r\nthe consequences of her refusal. His dogged will wore out the\r\nSpaniard's pride, and after a fruitless delay the King and Cortes\r\nratified the treaty in its original shape, with the important addition\r\nof an explicit annulment of the land grants. It was again sent in to\r\nthe Senate, and in spite of the \"continued, systematic, and laborious\r\neffort\" of \"Mr. Clay and his partisans to make it unpopular,\" it was\r\nratified by a handsome majority, there being against it \"only four\r\nvotes--Brown, of Louisiana, who married a sister of Clay's wife;\r\nRichard M. Johnson, of Kentucky, against his own better judgment, from\r\nmere political subserviency to Clay; Williams, of Tennessee, from\r\nparty impulses connected with hatred of General Jackson; and Trimble,\r\nof Ohio, from some maggot of the brain.\" Two years had elapsed since\r\nthe former ratification, and no little patience had been required to\r\nawait so long the final achievement of a success so ardently longed\r\nfor, once apparently gained, and anon so cruelly thwarted. But the\r\ntriumph was rather enhanced than diminished by all this difficulty and\r\ndelay. A long and checkered history, wherein appeared infinite labor,\r\nmany a severe trial of temper and hard test of moral courage, bitter\r\ndisappointment, ignoble artifices of opponents, ungenerous         (p. 125)\r\nopposition growing out of unworthy personal motives at home, was now\r\nat last closed by a chapter which appeared only the more gratifying by\r\ncontrast with what had gone before. Mr. Adams recorded, with less of\r\nexultation than might have been pardonable, the utter discomfiture of\r\n\"all the calculators of my downfall by the Spanish negotiation,\" and\r\nreflected cheerfully that he had been left with \"credit rather augmented\r\nthan impaired by the result,\"--credit not in excess of his deserts.\r\nMany years afterwards, in changed circumstances, an outcry was raised\r\nagainst the agreement which was arrived at concerning the southwestern\r\nboundary of Louisiana. Most unjustly it was declared that Mr. Adams\r\nhad sacrificed a portion of the territory of the United States. But\r\npolitical motives were too plainly to be discerned in these tardy\r\ncriticisms; and though General Jackson saw fit, for personal reasons,\r\nto animadvert severely upon the clause establishing this boundary\r\nline, yet there was abundant evidence to show not only that he, like\r\nalmost everybody else, had been greatly pleased with it at the time,\r\nbut even that he had then upon consultation expressed a deliberate and\r\nspecial approval.\r\n\r\nThe same day, February 22, 1821, closed, says Mr. Adams, \"two of the\r\nmost memorable transactions of my life.\" That he should speak thus (p. 126)\r\nof the exchange of ratifications of the Spanish treaty is natural; but\r\nthe other so \"memorable transaction\" may not appear of equal magnitude.\r\nIt was the sending in to Congress of his report upon weights and\r\nmeasures. This was one of those vast labors, involving tenfold more\r\ntoil than all the negotiations with Onis and Vivês, but bringing no\r\nproportionate fame, however well it might be performed. The subject\r\nwas one which had \"occupied for the last sixty years many of the\r\nablest men in Europe, and to which all the power and all the\r\nphilosophical and mathematical learning and ingenuity of France and of\r\nGreat Britain\" had during that period been incessantly directed. It\r\nwas fairly enough described as a \"fearful and oppressive task.\" Upon\r\nits dry and uncongenial difficulties Mr. Adams had been employed with\r\nhis wonted industry for upwards of four years; he now spoke of the\r\nresult modestly as \"a hurried and imperfect work.\" But others, who\r\nhave had to deal with the subject, have found this report a solid and\r\nmagnificent monument of research and reflection, which has not even\r\nyet been superseded by later treatises. Mr. Adams was honest in labor\r\nas in everything, and was never careless at points where inaccuracy or\r\nlack of thoroughness might be expected to escape detection.        (p. 127)\r\nHence his success in a task upon which it is difficult to imagine other\r\nstatesmen of that day--Clay, Webster, or Calhoun, for example--so much\r\nas making an effort. The topic is not one concerning which readers\r\nwould tolerate much lingering. Suffice it then to say that the\r\ndocument illustrated the ability and the character of the man, and so\r\nwith this brief mention to dismiss in a paragraph an achievement\r\nwhich, had it been accomplished in any more showy department, would\r\nalone have rendered Mr. Adams famous.\r\n\r\nIt is highly gratifying now to look back upon the high spirit and\r\nindependent temper uniformly displayed by Mr. Adams abroad and at home\r\nin all dealings with foreign powers. Never in any instance did he\r\ndisplay the least tinge of that rodomontade and boastful extravagance\r\nwhich have given an underbred air to so many of our diplomats, and\r\nwhich inevitably cause the basis for such self-laudation to appear of\r\ndubious sufficiency. But he had the happy gift of a native pride which\r\nenabled him to support in the most effective manner the dignity of the\r\npeople for whom he spoke. For example, in treaties between the United\r\nStates and European powers the latter were for a time wont to name\r\nthemselves first throughout the instruments, contrary to the custom of\r\nalternation practised in treaties between themselves. With some    (p. 128)\r\ndifficulty, partly interposed, it must be confessed, by his own\r\nAmerican coadjutors, Mr. Adams succeeded in putting a stop to this\r\nusage. It was a matter of insignificant detail, in one point of view;\r\nbut in diplomacy insignificant details often symbolize important\r\nfacts, and there is no question that this habit had been construed as\r\na tacit but intentional arrogance of superiority on the part of the\r\nEuropeans.\r\n\r\nFor a long period after the birth of the country there was a strong\r\ntendency, not yet so eradicated as to be altogether undiscoverable, on\r\nthe part of American statesmen to keep one eye turned covertly askance\r\nupon the trans-Atlantic courts, and to consider, not without a certain\r\nanxious deference, what appearance the new United States might be\r\npresenting to the critical eyes of foreign countries and diplomats.\r\nMr. Adams was never guilty of such indirect admissions of an inferiority\r\nwhich apparently he never felt. In the matter of the acquisition of\r\nFlorida, Crawford suggested that England and France regarded the\r\npeople of the United States as ambitious and encroaching; wherefore he\r\nadvised a moderate policy in order to remove this impression. Mr.\r\nAdams on the other side declared that he was not in favor of our\r\ngiving ourselves any concern whatever about the opinions of any    (p. 129)\r\nforeign power. \"If the world do not hold us for Romans,\" he said,\r\n\"they will take us for Jews, and of the two vices I would rather be\r\ncharged with that which has greatness mingled in its composition.\" His\r\nviews were broad and grand. He was quite ready to have the world\r\nbecome \"familiarized with the idea of considering our proper dominion\r\nto be the continent of North America.\" This extension he declared to\r\nbe a \"law of nature.\" To suppose that Spain and England could, through\r\nthe long lapse of time, retain their possessions on this side of the\r\nAtlantic seemed to him a \"physical, moral, and political absurdity.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctrine which has been christened with the name of President\r\nMonroe seems likely to win for him the permanent glory of having\r\noriginated the wise policy which that familiar phrase now signifies.\r\nIt might, however, be shown that by right of true paternity the\r\nbantling should have borne a different patronymic. Not only is the\r\n\"Monroe Doctrine,\" as that phrase is customarily construed in our day,\r\nmuch more comprehensive than the simple theory first expressed by\r\nMonroe and now included in the modern doctrine as a part in the whole,\r\nbut a principle more fully identical with the imperial one of to-day\r\nhad been conceived and shaped by Mr. Adams before the delivery of  (p. 130)\r\nMonroe's famous message. As has just been remarked, he looked forward\r\nto the possession of the whole North American continent by the United\r\nStates as a sure destiny, and for his own part, whenever opportunity\r\noffered, he was never backward to promote this glorious ultimate\r\nconsummation. He was in favor of the acquisition of Louisiana, whatever\r\nfault he might find with the scheme of Mr. Jefferson for making it a\r\nstate; he was ready in 1815 to ask the British plenipotentiaries to\r\ncede Canada simply as a matter of common sense and mutual convenience,\r\nand as the comfortable result of a war in which the United States had\r\nbeen worsted; he never labored harder than in negotiating for the\r\nFloridas, and in pushing our western boundaries to the Pacific; in\r\nApril, 1823, he wrote to the American minister at Madrid the significant\r\nremark: \"It is scarcely possible to resist the conviction that the\r\nannexation of Cuba to our Federal Republic will be indispensable to\r\nthe continuance and integrity of the Union.\" Encroachments never\r\nseemed distasteful to him, and he was always forward to stretch a\r\npoint in order to advocate or defend a seizure of disputed North\r\nAmerican territory, as in the cases of Amelia Island, Pensacola, and\r\nGalveston. When discussion arose with Russia concerning her        (p. 131)\r\npossessions on the northwest coast of this continent, Mr. Adams\r\naudaciously told the Russian minister, Baron Tuyl, July 17, 1823,\r\n\"that we should contest the rights of Russia to _any_ territorial\r\nestablishment on this continent, and that we should assume distinctly\r\nthe principle that the American continents are no longer subjects for\r\nany new European colonial establishments.\" \"This,\" says Mr. Charles\r\nFrancis Adams in a footnote to the passage in the Diary, \"is the first\r\nhint of the policy so well known afterwards as the Monroe Doctrine.\"\r\nNearly five months later, referring to the same matter in his message\r\nto Congress, December 2, 1823, President Monroe said: \"The occasion\r\nhas been judged proper for asserting, as a principle in which the\r\nrights and interests of the United States are involved, that the\r\nAmerican continents, by the free and independent condition which they\r\nhave assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as\r\nsubjects for future colonization by any European powers.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that both Mr. Adams and President Monroe used the\r\nphrase \"continents,\" including thereby South as well as North America.\r\nA momentous question was imminent, which fortunately never called for\r\na determination by action, but which in this latter part of 1823\r\nthreatened to do so at any moment. Cautious and moderate as the    (p. 132)\r\nUnited States had been, under Mr. Adams's guidance, in recognizing\r\nthe freedom and autonomy of the South American states, yet in time the\r\nrecognition was made of one after another, and the emancipation of\r\nSouth America had come, while Mr. Adams was yet Secretary, to be\r\nregarded as an established fact. But now, in 1823-24, came mutterings\r\nfrom across the Atlantic indicating a strong probability that the\r\nmembers of the Holy Alliance would interfere in behalf of monarchical\r\nand anti-revolutionary principles, and would assist in the resubjugation\r\nof the successful insurgents. That each one of the powers who should\r\ncontribute to this huge crusade would expect and receive territorial\r\nreward could not be doubted. Mr. Adams, in unison with most of his\r\ncountrymen, contemplated with profound distrust and repulsion the\r\npossibility of such an European inroad. Stimulated by the prospect of\r\nso unwelcome neighbors, he prepared some dispatches, \"drawn to\r\ncorrespond exactly\" with the sentiments of Mr. Monroe's message, in\r\nwhich he appears to have taken a very high and defiant position. These\r\ndocuments, coming before the Cabinet for consideration, caused some\r\nflutter among his associates. In the possible event of the Holy\r\nAlliance actually intermeddling in South American affairs, it was  (p. 133)\r\nsaid, the principles enunciated by the Secretary of State would\r\ninvolve this country in war with a very formidable confederation. Mr.\r\nAdams acknowledged this, but courageously declared that in such a\r\ncrisis he felt quite ready to take even this spirited stand. His\r\naudacious spirit went far in advance of the cautious temper of the\r\nMonroe administration; possibly it went too far in advance of the\r\ndictates of a wise prudence, though fortunately the course of events\r\nnever brought this question to trial; and it is at least gratifying to\r\ncontemplate such a manifestation of daring temper.\r\n\r\nBut though so bold and independent, Mr. Adams was not habitually\r\nreckless nor prone to excite animosity by needless arrogance in action\r\nor extravagance in principle. In any less perilous extremity than was\r\npresented by this menaced intrusion of combined Europe he followed\r\nrigidly the wise rule of non-interference. For many years before this\r\nstage was reached he had been holding in difficult check the\r\nenthusiasts who, under the lead of Mr. Clay, would have embroiled us\r\nwith Spain and Portugal. Once he was made the recipient of a very\r\namusing proposition from the Portuguese minister, that the United\r\nStates and Portugal, as \"the two great powers of the western hemisphere,\"\r\nshould concert together a grand American system. The drollery pf   (p. 134)\r\nthis notion was of a kind that Mr. Adams could appreciate, though\r\nto most manifestations of humor he was utterly impervious. But after\r\ngiving vent to some contemptuous merriment he adds, with a just and\r\nserious pride: \"As to an American system, we have it; we constitute\r\nthe whole of it; there is no community of interests or of principles\r\nbetween North and South America.\" This sound doctrine was put forth in\r\n1820; and it was only modified in the manner that we have seen during\r\na brief period in 1823, in face of the alarming vision not only of\r\nSpain and Portugal restored to authority, but of Russia in possession\r\nof California and more, France in possession of Mexico, and perhaps\r\nGreat Britain becoming mistress of Cuba.\r\n\r\nSo far as European affairs were concerned, Mr. Adams always and\r\nconsistently refused to become entangled in them, even in the slightest\r\nand most indirect manner. When the cause of Greek liberty aroused the\r\nusual throng of noisy advocates for active interference, he contented\r\nhimself with expressions of cordial sympathy, accompanied by perfectly\r\ndistinct and explicit statements that under no circumstances could any\r\naid in the way of money or auxiliary forces be expected from this\r\ncountry. Neutrals we were and would remain in any and all          (p. 135)\r\nEuropean quarrels. When Stratford Canning urged, with the uttermost\r\nmeasure of persistence of which even he was capable, that for the\r\nsuppression of the slave trade some such arrangement might be made as\r\nthat of mixed tribunals for the trial of slave-trading vessels, and\r\nalleged that divers European powers were uniting for this purpose, Mr.\r\nAdams suggested, as an insuperable obstacle, \"the general extra-European\r\npolicy of the United States--a policy which they had always pursued as\r\nbest suited to their own interests, and best adapted to harmonize with\r\nthose of Europe. This policy had also been that of Europe, which had\r\nnever considered the United States as belonging to her system.... It\r\nwas best for both parties that they should continue to do so.\" In any\r\nEuropean combinations, said Mr. Adams, in which the United States\r\nshould become a member, she must soon become an important power, and\r\nmust always be, in many respects, an uncongenial one. It was best that\r\nshe should keep wholly out of European politics, even of such leagues\r\nas one for the suppression of the slave trade. He added, that he did\r\nnot wish his language to be construed as importing \"an unsocial and\r\nsulky spirit on the part of the United States;\" for no such temper\r\nexisted; it had simply been the policy of Europe to consider       (p. 136)\r\nthis country as standing aloof from all European federations, and in\r\nthis treatment \"we had acquiesced, because it fell in with our own\r\npolicy.\"\r\n\r\nIn a word, Mr. Adams, by his language and actions, established and\r\ndeveloped precisely that doctrine which has since been adopted by this\r\ncountry under the doubly incorrect name of the \"Monroe Doctrine,\"--a\r\nname doubly incorrect, because even the real \"Monroe Doctrine\" was not\r\nan original idea of Mr. Monroe, and because the doctrine which now\r\ngoes by that name is not identical with the doctrine which Monroe did\r\nonce declare. Mr. Adams's principle was simply that the United States\r\nwould take no part whatsoever in foreign politics, not even in those\r\nof South America, save in the extreme event, eliminated from among\r\nthings possible in this generation, of such an interference as was\r\ncontemplated by the Holy Alliance; and that, on the other hand, she\r\nwould permit no European power to gain any new foothold upon this\r\ncontinent. Time and experience have not enabled us to improve upon the\r\nprinciples which Mr. Adams worked out for us.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams had some pretty stormy times with Mr. Stratford Canning--the\r\nsame gentleman who in his later life is familiar to the readers of (p. 137)\r\nKinglake's \"History of the Crimean War\" as Lord Stratford de\r\nRedclyffe, or Eltchi. That minister's overbearing and dictatorial\r\ndeportment was afterwards not out of place when he was representing\r\nthe protecting power of Great Britain in the court of the \"sick man.\"\r\nBut when he began to display his arrogance in the face of Mr. Adams he\r\nfound that he was bearding one who was at least his equal in pride and\r\ntemper. The naïve surprise which he manifested on making this\r\ndiscovery is very amusing, and the accounts of the interviews between\r\nthe two are among the most pleasing episodes in the history of our\r\nforeign relations. Nor are they less interesting as a sort of\r\nconfidential peep at the asperities of diplomacy. It appears that\r\nbesides the composed and formal dignity of phrase which alone the\r\npublic knows in published state papers and official correspondence,\r\nthere is also an official language of wrath and retort not at all\r\nartificial or stilted, but quite homelike and human in its sound.\r\n\r\nOne subject much discussed between Mr. Adams and Mr. Canning related\r\nto the English propositions for joint efforts to suppress the slave\r\ntrade. Great Britain had engaged with much vigor and certainly with an\r\nadmirable humanity in this cause. Her scheme was that each power\r\nshould keep armed cruisers on the coast of Africa, that the        (p. 138)\r\nwar-ships of either nation might search the merchant vessels of the\r\nother, and that mixed courts of joint commissioners should try all\r\ncases of capture. This plan had been urged upon the several European\r\nnations, but with imperfect success. Portugal, Spain, and the\r\nNetherlands had assented to it; Russia, France, Austria, and Prussia\r\nhad rejected it. Mr. Adams's notion was that the ministry were, in\r\ntheir secret hearts, rather lukewarm in the business, but that they\r\nwere so pressed by \"the party of the saints in Parliament\" that they\r\nwere obliged to make a parade of zeal. Whether this suspicion was\r\ncorrect or not, it is certain that Mr. Stratford Canning was very\r\npersistent in the presentation of his demands, and could not be\r\npersuaded to take No for an answer. Had it been possible to give any\r\nmore favorable reply no one in the United States in that day would\r\nhave been better pleased than Mr. Adams to do so. But the obstacles\r\nwere insuperable. Besides the undesirability of departing from the\r\n\"extra-European policy,\" the mixed courts would have been\r\nunconstitutional, and could not have been established even by act of\r\nCongress, while the claims advanced by Great Britain to search our\r\nships for English-born seamen in time of war utterly precluded the\r\npossibility of admitting any rights of search whatsoever upon her  (p. 139)\r\npart, even in time of peace, for any purpose or in any shape. In vain\r\ndid the Englishman reiterate his appeal. Mr. Adams as often explained\r\nthat the insistence of England upon her outrageous claim had rendered\r\nthe United States so sensitive upon the entire subject of search that\r\nno description of right of that kind could ever be tolerated. \"All\r\nconcession of principle,\" he said, \"tended to encourage encroachment,\r\nand if naval officers were once habituated to search the vessels of\r\nother nations in time of peace for one thing, they would be still more\r\nencouraged to practise it for another thing in time of war.\" The only\r\nway for Great Britain to achieve her purpose would be \"to bind herself\r\nby an article, as strong and explicit as language can make it, never\r\nagain in time of war to take a man from an American vessel.\" This of\r\ncourse was an inadmissible proposition, and so Mr. Stratford Canning's\r\nincessant urgency produced no substantial results. This discussion,\r\nhowever, was generally harmonious. Once only, in its earlier stages,\r\nMr. Adams notes a remark of Mr. Canning, repeated for the second time,\r\nand not altogether gratifying. He said, writes Mr. Adams, \"that he\r\nshould always receive any observations that I may make to him with a\r\njust deference to my advance of years--over him. This is one of    (p. 140)\r\nthose equivocal compliments which, according to Sterne, a Frenchman\r\nalways returns with a bow.\"\r\n\r\nIt was when they got upon the matter of the American settlement at the\r\nmouth of the Columbia River, that the two struck fire. Possession of\r\nthis disputed spot had been taken by the Americans, but was broken up\r\nby the British during the war of 1812. After the declaration of peace\r\nupon the _status ante bellum_, a British government vessel had been\r\ndispatched upon the special errand of making formal return of the port\r\nto the Americans. In January, 1821, certain remarks made in debate in\r\nthe House of Representatives, followed soon afterward by publication\r\nin the \"National Intelligencer\" of a paper signed by Senator Eaton,\r\nled Mr. Canning to think that the Government entertained the design of\r\nestablishing a substantial settlement at the mouth of the river. On\r\nJanuary 26 he called upon Mr. Adams and inquired the intentions of the\r\nAdministration in regard to this. Mr. Adams replied that an increase\r\nof the present settlement was not improbable. Thereupon Mr. Canning\r\ndropping the air of \"easy familiarity\" which had previously marked the\r\nintercourse between the two, and \"assuming a tone more peremptory\"\r\nthan Mr. Adams \"was disposed to endure,\" expressed his great       (p. 141)\r\nsurprise. Mr. Adams \"with a corresponding change of tone\" expressed\r\nequal surprise, \"both at the form and substance of his address.\" Mr.\r\nCanning said that \"he conceived such a settlement would be a direct\r\nviolation of the article of the Convention of 20th October, 1818.\" Mr.\r\nAdams took down a volume, read the article, and said, \"Now, sir, if\r\nyou have any charge to make against the American Government for a\r\nviolation of this article, you will please to make the communication\r\nin writing.\" Mr. Canning retorted, with great vehemence:--\r\n\r\n     \"'And do you suppose, sir, that I am to be dictated to as to the\r\n     manner in which I may think proper to communicate with the\r\n     American Government?' I answered, 'No, sir. We know very well\r\n     what are the privileges of foreign ministers, and mean to respect\r\n     them. But you will give us leave to determine what communications\r\n     we will receive, and how we will receive them; and you may be\r\n     assured we are as little disposed to submit to dictation as to\r\n     exercise it.' He then, in a louder and more passionate tone of\r\n     voice, said: 'And am I to understand that I am to be refused\r\n     henceforth any conference with you upon the subject of my\r\n     mission?' 'Not at all, sir,' said I, 'my request is, that if you\r\n     have anything further to say to me _upon this subject_, you would\r\n     say it in writing. And my motive is to avoid what, both from the\r\n     nature of the subject and from the manner in which you        (p. 142)\r\n     have thought proper to open it, I foresee will tend only to\r\n     mutual irritation, and not to an amicable arrangement.' With some\r\n     abatement of tone, but in the same peremptory manner, he said,\r\n     'Am I to understand that you refuse any further conference with\r\n     me on this subject?' I said, 'No. But you will understand that I\r\n     am not pleased either with the grounds upon which you have sought\r\n     this conference, nor with the questions which you have seen fit\r\n     to put to me.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Adams then proceeded to expose the impropriety of a foreign\r\nminister demanding from the Administration an explanation of words\r\nuttered in debate in Congress, and also said that he supposed that the\r\nBritish had no claim to the territory in question. Mr. Canning\r\nrejoined, and referred to the sending out of the American ship of war\r\nOntario, in 1817, without any notice to the British minister[3] at\r\nWashington,--\r\n\r\n     \"speaking in a very emphatic manner and as if there had been an\r\n     intended secret expedition ... which had been detected only by\r\n     the vigilance and penetration of the British minister. I\r\n     answered, 'Why, Mr. Bagot did say something to me about it; but I\r\n     certainly did not think him serious, and we had a good-humored\r\n     laughing conversation on the occasion.' Canning, with great\r\n     vehemence: 'You may rely upon it, sir, that it was no laughing\r\n     matter to him; for I have seen his report to his government and\r\n     know what his feelings concerning it were.' I replied,        (p. 143)\r\n     'This is the first intimation I have ever received that Mr. Bagot\r\n     took the slightest offence at what then passed between us, ...\r\n     and you will give me leave to say that when he left this\r\n     country'--Here I was going to add that the last words he said to\r\n     me were words of thanks for the invariable urbanity and\r\n     liberality of my conduct and the personal kindness which he had\r\n     uniformly received from me. But I could not finish the sentence.\r\n     Mr. Canning, in a paroxysm of extreme irritation, broke out: 'I\r\n     stop you there. I will not endure a misrepresentation of what I\r\n     say. I never said that Mr. Bagot took offence at anything that\r\n     had passed between him and you; and nothing that I said imported\r\n     any such thing.' Then ... added in the same passionate manner: 'I\r\n     am treated like a school-boy.' I then resumed: 'Mr. Canning, I\r\n     have a distinct recollection of the substance of the short\r\n     conversation between Mr. Bagot and me at that time; and it was\r\n     this'--'No doubt, sir,' said Canning, interrupting me again, 'no\r\n     doubt, sir, Mr. Bagot answered you like a man of good breeding\r\n     and good humor.'\"\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3: Then Mr. Bagot.]\r\n\r\nMr. Adams began again and succeeded in making, without further\r\ninterruption, a careful recital of his talk with Mr. Bagot. While he\r\nwas speaking Mr. Canning grew cooler, and expressed some surprise at\r\nwhat he heard. But in a few moments the conversation again became warm\r\nand personal. Mr. Adams remarked that heretofore he had thrown off (p. 144)\r\nsome of the \"cautious reserve\" which might have been \"strictly\r\nregular\" between them, and that\r\n\r\n     \"'so long as his (Canning's) professions had been supported by\r\n     his conduct'--Here Mr. Canning again stopped me by repeating with\r\n     great vehemence, 'My conduct! I am responsible for my conduct\r\n     only to my government!'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Adams replied, substantially, that he could respect the rights of\r\nMr. Canning and maintain his own, and that he thought the best mode of\r\ntreating this topic in future would be by writing. Mr. Canning then\r\nexpressed himself as\r\n\r\n     \"'willing to forget all that had now passed.' I told him that I\r\n     neither asked nor promised him to forget.... He asked again if he\r\n     was to understand me as refusing to confer with him further on\r\n     the subject. I said, 'No.' 'Would I appoint a time for that\r\n     purpose?' I said, 'Now, if he pleased.... But as he appeared to\r\n     be under some excitement, perhaps he might prefer some other\r\n     time, in which case I would readily receive him to-morrow at one\r\n     o'clock;' upon which he rose and took leave, saying he would come\r\n     at that time.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day, accordingly, this genial pair again encountered. Mr.\r\nAdams noted at first in Mr. Canning's manner \"an effort at coolness,\r\nbut no appearance of cheerfulness or good humor. I saw there was   (p. 145)\r\nno relaxation of the tone he had yesterday assumed, and felt that\r\nnone would on my part be suitable.\" They went over quietly enough some\r\nof the ground traversed the day before, Mr. Adams again explaining the\r\nimpropriety of Mr. Canning questioning him concerning remarks made in\r\ndebate in Congress. It was, he said, as if Mr. Rush, hearing in the\r\nHouse of Commons something said about sending troops to the Shetland\r\nIslands, should proceed to question Lord Castlereagh about it.\r\n\r\n     \"'Have you,' said Mr. Canning, 'any claim to the Shetland\r\n     Islands?' 'Have you any _claim_,' said I, 'to the mouth of\r\n     Columbia River?' 'Why, do you not _know_,' replied he, 'that we\r\n     have a claim?' 'I do not _know_,' said I, 'what you claim nor\r\n     what you do not claim. You claim India; you claim Africa; you\r\n     claim'--'Perhaps,' said he, 'a piece of the moon.' 'No,' said I,\r\n     'I have not heard that you claim exclusively any part of the\r\n     moon; but there is not a spot on _this_ habitable globe that I\r\n     could affirm you do not claim!'\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation continued with alternations of lull and storm, Mr.\r\nCanning at times becoming warm and incensed and interrupting Mr.\r\nAdams, who retorted with a dogged asperity which must have been\r\nextremely irritating. Mr. Adams said that he did \"not expect to be (p. 146)\r\nplied with captious questions\" to obtain indirectly that which\r\nhad been directly denied. Mr. Canning, \"exceedingly irritated,\"\r\ncomplained of the word \"captious.\" Mr. Adams retaliated by reciting\r\noffensive language used by Mr. Canning, who in turn replied that he\r\nhad been speaking only in self-defence. Mr. Canning found occasion to\r\nmake again his peculiarly rasping remark that he should always strive\r\nto show towards Mr. Adams the deference due to his \"more advanced\r\nyears.\" After another very uncomfortable passage, Mr. Adams said that\r\nthe behavior of Mr. Canning in making the observations of members of\r\nCongress a basis of official interrogations was a pretension the more\r\nnecessary to be resisted because this\r\n\r\n     \"'was not the first time it had been raised by a British minister\r\n     here.' He asked, with great emotion, who that minister was. I\r\n     answered, 'Mr. Jackson.' 'And you got rid of him!' said Mr.\r\n     Canning, in a tone of violent passion--'and you got rid of\r\n     him!--and you got rid of him!' This repetition of the same words,\r\n     always in the same tone, was with pauses of a few seconds between\r\n     each of them, as if for a reply. I said: 'Sir, my reference to\r\n     the pretension of Mr. Jackson was not'--Here Mr. Canning\r\n     interrupted me by saying: 'If you think that by reference to Mr.\r\n     Jackson I am to be intimidated from the performance of my     (p. 147)\r\n     duty you will find yourself greatly mistaken.' 'I had not,\r\n     sir,' said I, 'the most distant intention of intimidating you\r\n     from the performance of your duty; nor was it with the intention\r\n     of alluding to any subsequent occurrences of his mission;\r\n     but'--Mr. Canning interrupted me again by saying, still in a tone\r\n     of high exasperation,--'Let me tell you, sir, that your reference\r\n     to the case of Mr. Jackson is _exceedingly offensive_.' 'I do not\r\n     know,' said I, 'whether I shall be able to finish what I intended\r\n     to say, under such continual interruptions.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Canning thereupon intimated by a bow his willingness to listen,\r\nand Mr. Adams reiterated what in a more fragmentary way he had already\r\nsaid. Mr. Canning then made a formal speech, mentioning his desire \"to\r\ncultivate harmony and smooth down all remnants of asperity between the\r\ntwo countries,\" again gracefully referred to the deference which he\r\nshould at all times pay to Mr. Adams's age, and closed by declaring,\r\nwith a significant emphasis, that he would \"never forget the respect\r\ndue from him _to the American Government_.\" Mr. Adams bowed in silence\r\nand the stormy interview ended. A day or two afterward the disputants\r\nmet by accident, and Mr. Canning showed such signs of resentment that\r\nthere passed between them a \"bare salutation.\"\r\n\r\nIn the condition of our relations with Great Britain at the time   (p. 148)\r\nof these interviews any needless ill-feeling was strongly to be\r\ndeprecated. But Mr. Adams's temperament was such that he always saw\r\nthe greater chance of success in strong and spirited conduct; nor\r\ncould he endure that the dignity of the Republic, any more than its\r\nsafety, should take detriment in his hands. Moreover he understood\r\nEnglishmen better perhaps than they have ever been understood by any\r\nother of the public men of the United States, and he handled and\r\nsubdued them with a temper and skill highly agreeable to contemplate.\r\nThe President supported him fully throughout the matter, and the\r\ndiscomfiture and wrath of Mr. Canning never became even indirectly a\r\ncause of regret to the country.\r\n\r\nAs the years allotted to Monroe passed on, the manoeuvring among the\r\ncandidates for the succession to the Presidency grew in activity.\r\nThere were several possible presidents in the field, and during the\r\n\"era of good feeling\" many an aspiring politician had his brief period\r\nof mild expectancy followed in most cases only too surely by a hopeless\r\nrelegation to obscurity. There were, however, four whose anticipations\r\nrested upon a substantial basis. William H. Crawford, Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, had been the rival of Monroe for nomination by the\r\nCongressional caucus, and had then developed sufficient strength   (p. 149)\r\nto make him justly sanguine that he might stand next to Monroe in the\r\nsuccession as he apparently did in the esteem of their common party.\r\nMr. Clay, Speaker of the House of Representatives, had such\r\nexpectations as might fairly grow out of his brilliant reputation,\r\npowerful influence in Congress, and great personal popularity. Mr.\r\nAdams was pointed out not only by his deserts but also by his position\r\nin the Cabinet, it having been the custom heretofore to promote the\r\nSecretary of State to the Presidency. It was not until the time of\r\nelection was near at hand that the strength of General Jackson,\r\nfounded of course upon the effect of his military prestige upon the\r\nmasses of the people, began to appear to the other competitors a\r\nformidable element in the great rivalry. For a while Mr. Calhoun might\r\nhave been regarded as a fifth, since he had already become the great\r\nchief of the South; but this cause of his strength was likewise his\r\nweakness, since it was felt that the North was fairly entitled to\r\npresent the next candidate. The others, who at one time and another\r\nhad aspirations, like De Witt Clinton and Tompkins, were never really\r\nformidable, and may be disregarded as insignificant threads in the\r\ncomplex political snarl which must be unravelled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stratford Canning]\r\n\r\nAs a study of the dark side of political society during this       (p. 150)\r\nperiod Mr. Adams's Diary is profoundly interesting. He writes with a\r\ncharming absence of reserve. If he thinks there is rascality at work,\r\nhe sets down the names of the knaves and expounds their various\r\nvillainies of act and motive with delightfully outspoken frankness.\r\nAll his life he was somewhat prone, it must be confessed, to\r\ndepreciate the moral characters of others, and to suspect unworthy\r\ndesigns in the methods or ends of those who crossed his path. It was\r\nthe not unnatural result of his own rigid resolve to be honest.\r\nRefraining with the stern conscientiousness, which was in the\r\ncomposition of his Puritan blood, from every act, whether in public or\r\nin private life, which seemed to him in the least degree tinged with\r\nimmorality, he found a sort of compensation for the restraints and\r\ndiscomforts of his own austerity in judging severely the less\r\npunctilious world around him. Whatever other faults he had, it is\r\nunquestionable that his uprightness was as consistent and unvarying as\r\ncan be reached by human nature. Yet his temptations were made the\r\ngreater and the more cruel by the beliefs constantly borne in upon him\r\nthat his rivals did not accept for their own governance in the contest\r\nthe same rules by which he was pledged to himself to abide. Jealousy\r\nenhanced suspicion, and suspicion in turn pricked jealousy. It is  (p. 151)\r\nnecessary, therefore, to be somewhat upon our guard in accepting\r\nhis estimates of men and acts at this period; though the broad general\r\nimpression to be gathered from his treatment of his rivals, even in\r\nthese confidential pages, is favorable at least to his justice of\r\ndisposition and honesty of intention.\r\n\r\nAt the outset Mr. Clay excited Mr. Adams's most lively resentment. The\r\npolicy which seemed most promising to that gentleman lay in antagonism\r\nto the Administration, whereas, in the absence of substantial party\r\nissues, there seemed, at least to members of that Administration, to\r\nbe no proper grounds for such antagonism. When, therefore, Mr. Clay\r\nfound or devised such grounds, the President and his Cabinet, vexed\r\nand harassed by the opposition of so influential a man, not\r\nunnaturally attributed his tactics to selfish and, in a political\r\nsense, corrupt motives. Thus Mr. Adams stigmatized his opposition to\r\nthe Florida treaty as prompted by no just objection to its\r\nstipulations, but by a malicious wish to bring discredit upon the\r\nnegotiator. Probably the charge was true, and Mr. Clay's honesty in\r\nopposing an admirable treaty can only be vindicated at the expense of\r\nhis understanding,--an explanation certainly not to be accepted. But\r\nwhen Mr. Adams attributed to the same motive of embarrassing the   (p. 152)\r\nAdministration Mr. Clay's energetic endeavors to force a recognition\r\nof the insurgent states of South America, he exaggerated the inimical\r\nelement in his rival's motives. It was the business of the President\r\nand Cabinet, and preëminently of the Secretary of State, to see to it\r\nthat the country should not move too fast in this very nice and\r\nperilous matter of recognizing the independence of rebels. Mr. Adams\r\nwas the responsible minister, and had to hold the reins; Mr. Clay,\r\noutside the official vehicle, cracked the lash probably a little more\r\nloudly than he would have done had he been on the coach-box. It may be\r\nassumed that in advocating his various motions looking to the\r\nappointment of ministers to the new states and to other acts of\r\nrecognition, he felt his eloquence rather fired than dampened by the\r\nthought of how much trouble he was making for Mr. Adams; but that he\r\nwas at the same time espousing the cause to which he sincerely wished\r\nwell is probably true. His ardent temper was stirred by this struggle\r\nfor independence, and his rhetorical nature could not resist the\r\nopportunities for fervid and brilliant oratory presented by this\r\nstruggle for freedom against mediæval despotism. Real convictions were\r\nsometimes diluted with rodomontade, and a true feeling was to some\r\nextent stimulated by the desire to embarrass a rival.\r\n\r\nEntire freedom from prejudice would have been too much to expect   (p. 153)\r\nfrom Mr. Adams; but his criticisms of Clay are seldom marked by\r\nany serious accusations or really bitter explosions of ill-temper.\r\nEarly in his term of office he writes that Mr. Clay has \"already\r\nmounted his South American great horse,\" and that his \"project is that\r\nin which John Randolph failed, to control or overthrow the Executive\r\nby swaying the House of Representatives.\" Again he says that \"Clay is\r\nas rancorously benevolent as John Randolph.\" The sting of these\r\nremarks lay rather in the comparison with Randolph than in their\r\ndirect allegations. In January, 1819, Adams notes that Clay has\r\n\"redoubled his rancor against me,\" and gives himself \"free swing to\r\nassault me ... both in his public speeches and by secret machinations,\r\nwithout scruple or delicacy.\" The diarist gloomily adds, that \"all\r\npublic business in Congress now connects itself with intrigues, and\r\nthere is great danger that the whole Government will degenerate into a\r\nstruggle of cabals.\" He was rather inclined to such pessimistic\r\nvaticinations; but it must be confessed that he spoke with too much\r\nreason on this occasion. In the absence of a sufficient supply of\r\nimportant public questions to absorb the energies of the men in public\r\nlife, the petty game of personal politics was playing with unusual\r\nzeal. As time went on, however, and the South American questions   (p. 154)\r\nwere removed from the arena, Adams's ill-feeling towards Clay became\r\ngreatly mitigated. Clay's assaults and opposition also gradually\r\ndwindled away; go-betweens carried to and fro disclaimers, made by the\r\nprincipals, of personal ill-will towards each other; and before the\r\ntime of election was actually imminent something as near the _entente\r\ncordiale_ was established as could be reasonably expected to exist\r\nbetween competitors very unlike both in moral and mental\r\nconstitution.[4]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4: For a deliberate estimate of Clay's\r\n                   character see Mr. Adams's Diary, v. 325.]\r\n\r\nMr. Adams's unbounded indignation and profound contempt were reserved\r\nfor Mr. Crawford, partly, it may be suspected by the cynically minded,\r\nbecause Crawford for a long time seemed to be by far the most\r\nformidable rival, but partly also because Crawford was in fact unable\r\nto resist the temptation to use ignoble means for attaining an end\r\nwhich he coveted too keenly for his own honor. It was only by degrees\r\nthat Adams began to suspect the underhand methods and malicious\r\npractices of Crawford; but as conviction was gradually brought home to\r\nhim his native tendency towards suspicion was enhanced to an extreme\r\ndegree. He then came to recognize in Crawford a wholly selfish     (p. 155)\r\nand scheming politician, who had the baseness to retain his seat in\r\nMr. Monroe's Cabinet with the secret persistent object of giving the\r\nmost fatal advice in his power. From that time forth he saw in every\r\nsuggestion made by the Secretary of the Treasury only an insidious\r\nintent to lead the Administration, and especially the Department of\r\nState, into difficulty, failure, and disrepute. He notes, evidently\r\nwith perfect belief, that for this purpose Crawford was even covertly\r\nbusy with the Spanish ambassador to prevent an accommodation of our\r\ndifferences with Spain. \"Oh, the windings of the human heart!\" he\r\nexclaims; \"possibly Crawford is not himself conscious of his real\r\nmotives for this conduct.\" Even the slender measure of charity\r\ninvolved in this last sentence rapidly evaporated from the poisoned\r\natmosphere of his mind. He mentions that Crawford has killed a man in\r\na duel; that he leaves unanswered a pamphlet \"supported by documents\"\r\nexhibiting him \"in the most odious light, as sacrificing every\r\nprinciple to his ambition.\" Because Calhoun would not support him for\r\nthe Presidency, Crawford stimulated a series of attacks upon the War\r\nDepartment. He was the \"instigator and animating spirit of the whole\r\nmovement both in Congress and at Richmond against Jackson and the\r\nAdministration.\" He was \"a worm preying upon the vitals of the     (p. 156)\r\nAdministration in its own body.\" He \"solemnly deposed in a court\r\nof justice that which is not true,\" for the purpose of bringing\r\ndiscredit upon the testimony given by Mr. Adams in the same cause. But\r\nMr. Adams says of this that he cannot bring himself to believe that\r\nCrawford has been guilty of wilful falsehood, though convicted of\r\ninaccuracy by his own words; for \"ambition debauches memory itself.\" A\r\nlittle later he would have been less merciful. In some vexatious and\r\ndifficult commercial negotiations which Mr. Adams was conducting with\r\nFrance, Crawford is \"afraid of [the result] being too favorable.\"\r\n\r\nTo form a just opinion of the man thus unpleasantly sketched is\r\ndifficult. For nearly eight years Mr. Adams was brought into close and\r\nconstant relations with him, and as a result formed a very low opinion\r\nof his character and by no means a high estimate of his abilities.\r\nEven after making a liberal allowance for the prejudice naturally\r\nsupervening from their rivalry there is left a residuum of condemnation\r\nabundantly sufficient to ruin a more vigorous reputation than Crawford\r\nhas left behind him. Apparently Mr. Calhoun, though a fellow\r\nSoutherner, thought no better of the ambitious Georgian than did Mr.\r\nAdams, to whom one day he remarked that Crawford was \"a very       (p. 157)\r\nsingular instance of a man of such character rising to the eminence he\r\nnow occupies; that there has not been in the history of the Union\r\nanother man with abilities so ordinary, with services so slender, and\r\nso thoroughly corrupt, who had contrived to make himself a candidate\r\nfor the Presidency.\" Nor was this a solitary expression of the\r\nfeelings of the distinguished South Carolinian.\r\n\r\nMr. E. H. Mills, Senator from Massachusetts, and a dispassionate\r\nobserver, speaks of Crawford with scant favor as \"coarse, rough,\r\nuneducated, of a pretty strong mind, a great intriguer, and determined\r\nto make himself President.\" He adds: \"Adams, Jackson, and Calhoun all\r\nthink well of each other, and are united at least in one thing,--to\r\nwit, a most thorough dread and abhorrence of Crawford.\"\r\n\r\nYet Crawford was for many years not only never without eager\r\nexpectations of his own, which narrowly missed realization and might\r\nnot have missed it had not his health broken down a few months too\r\nsoon, but he had a large following, strong friends, and an extensive\r\ninfluence. But if he really had great ability he had not the good\r\nfortune of an opportunity to show it; and he lives in history rather\r\nas a man from whom much was expected than as a man who achieved    (p. 158)\r\nmuch. One faculty, however, not of the best, but serviceable, he had\r\nin a rare degree: he thoroughly understood all the artifices of\r\npolitics; he knew how to interest and organize partisans, to obtain\r\nnewspaper support, and generally to extend and direct his following\r\nafter that fashion which soon afterward began to be fully developed by\r\nthe younger school of our public men. He was the _avant courier_ of a\r\nbad system, of which the first crude manifestations were received with\r\nwell-merited disrelish by the worthier among his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nIt is the more easy to believe that Adams's distrust of Crawford was a\r\nsincere conviction, when we consider his behavior towards another\r\ndangerous rival, General Jackson. In view of the new phase which the\r\nrelationship between these two men was soon to take on, Adams's hearty\r\nchampionship of Jackson for several years prior to 1825 deserves\r\nmention. The Secretary stood gallantly by the General at a crisis in\r\nJackson's life when he greatly needed such strong official backing,\r\nand in an hour of extreme need Adams alone in the Cabinet of Monroe\r\nlent an assistance which Jackson afterwards too readily forgot. Seldom\r\nhas a government been brought by the undue zeal of its servants into a\r\nquandary more perplexing than that into which the reckless military\r\nhero brought the Administration of President Monroe. Turned loose  (p. 159)\r\nin the regions of Florida, checked only by an uncertain and disputed\r\nboundary line running through half-explored forests, confronted by a\r\nhated foe whose strength he could well afford to despise, General\r\nJackson, in a war properly waged only against Indians, ran a wild and\r\nlawless, but very vigorous and effective, career in Spanish\r\npossessions. He hung a couple of British subjects with as scant trial\r\nand meagre shrift as if he had been a mediæval free-lance; he marched\r\nupon Spanish towns and peremptorily forced the blue-blooded commanders\r\nto capitulate in the most humiliating manner; afterwards, when the\r\nSpanish territory had become American, in his civil capacity as\r\nGovernor, he flung the Spanish Commissioner into jail. He treated\r\ninstructions, laws, and established usages as teasing cobwebs which\r\nany spirited public servant was in duty bound to break; then he\r\nquietly stated his willingness to let the country take the benefit of\r\nhis irregular proceedings and make him the scapegoat or martyr if such\r\nshould be needed. How to treat this too successful chieftain was no\r\nsimple problem. He had done what he ought not to have done, yet\r\neverybody in the country was heartily glad that he had done it. He\r\nought not to have hung Arbuthnot and Ambrister, nor to have seized (p. 160)\r\nPensacola, nor later on to have imprisoned Callava; yet the general\r\nefficiency of his procedure fully accorded with the secret disposition\r\nof the country. It was, however, not easy to establish the propriety\r\nof his trenchant doings upon any acknowledged principles of law, and\r\nduring the long period through which these disturbing feats extended,\r\nJackson was left in painful solitude by those who felt obliged to\r\njudge his actions by rule rather than by sympathy. The President was\r\nconcerned lest his Administration should be brought into indefensible\r\nembarrassment; Calhoun was personally displeased because the\r\ninstructions issued from his department had been exceeded; Crawford\r\neagerly sought to make the most of such admirable opportunities for\r\ndestroying the prestige of one who might grow into a dangerous rival;\r\nClay, who hated a military hero, indulged in a series of fierce\r\ndenunciations in the House of Representatives; Mr. Adams alone stood\r\ngallantly by the man who had dared to take vigorous measures upon his\r\nown sole responsibility. His career touched a kindred chord in Adams's\r\nown independent and courageous character, and perhaps for the only\r\ntime in his life the Secretary of State became almost sophistical in\r\nthe arguments by which he endeavored to sustain the impetuous warrior\r\nagainst an adverse Cabinet. The authority given to Jackson to      (p. 161)\r\ncross the Spanish frontier in pursuit of the Indian enemy was\r\njustified as being only defensive warfare; then \"all the rest,\" argued\r\nAdams, \"even to the order for taking the Fort of Barrancas by storm,\r\nwas incidental, deriving its character from the object, which was not\r\nhostility to Spain, but the termination of the Indian war.\" Through\r\nlong and anxious sessions Adams stood fast in opposing \"the unanimous\r\nopinions\" of the President, Crawford, Calhoun, and Wirt. Their policy\r\nseemed to him a little ignoble and wholly blundering, because, he\r\nsaid, \"it is weakness and a confession of weakness. The disclaimer of\r\npower in the Executive is of dangerous example and of evil\r\nconsequences. There is injustice to the officer in disavowing him,\r\nwhen in principle he is strictly justifiable.\" This behavior upon Mr.\r\nAdams's part was the more generous and disinterested because the\r\nearlier among these doings of Jackson incensed Don Onis extremely and\r\nwere near bringing about the entire disruption of that important\r\nnegotiation with Spain upon which Mr. Adams had so much at stake. But\r\nfew civilians have had a stronger dash of the fighting element than\r\nhad Mr. Adams, and this impelled him irresistibly to stand shoulder to\r\nshoulder with Jackson in such an emergency, regardless of possible\r\nconsequences to himself. He preferred to insist that the hanging   (p. 162)\r\nof Arbuthnot and Ambrister was according to the laws of war and to\r\nmaintain that position in the teeth of Stratford Canning rather than\r\nto disavow it and render apology and reparation. So three years later\r\nwhen Jackson was again in trouble by reason of his arrest of Callava,\r\nhe still found a stanch advocate in Adams, who, having made an argument\r\nfor the defence which would have done credit to a subtle-minded\r\nbarrister, concluded by adopting the sentiment of Hume concerning the\r\nexecution of Don Pantaleon de Sa by Oliver Cromwell,--if the laws of\r\nnations had been violated, \"it was by a signal act of justice\r\ndeserving universal approbation.\" Later still, on January 8, 1824,\r\nbeing the anniversary of the victory of New Orleans, as if to make a\r\nconspicuous declaration of his opinions in favor of Jackson, Mr. Adams\r\ngave a great ball in his honor, \"at which about one thousand persons\r\nattended.\"[5]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5: Senator Mills says of this grand ball:\r\n                   \"Eight large rooms were open and literally filled\r\n                   to overflowing. There must have been at least a\r\n                   thousand people there; and so far as Mr. Adams was\r\n                   concerned it certainly evinced a great deal of\r\n                   taste, elegance, and good sense.... Many stayed\r\n                   till twelve and one.... It is the universal opinion\r\n                   that nothing has ever equalled this party here\r\n                   either in brilliancy of preparation or elegance of\r\n                   the company.\"]\r\n\r\nHe was in favor of offering to the General the position of         (p. 163)\r\nminister to Mexico; and before Jackson had developed into a rival of\r\nhimself for the Presidency, he exerted himself to secure the\r\nVice-Presidency for him. Thus by argument and by influence in the\r\nCabinet, in many a private interview, and in the world of society,\r\nalso by wise counsel when occasion offered, Mr. Adams for many years\r\nmade himself the noteworthy and indeed the only powerful friend of\r\nGeneral Jackson. Nor up to the last moment, and when Jackson had\r\nbecome his most dangerous competitor, is there any derogatory passage\r\nconcerning him in the Diary.\r\n\r\nAs the period of election drew nigh, interest in it absorbed\r\neverything else; indeed during the last year of Monroe's\r\nAdministration public affairs were so quiescent and the public\r\nbusiness so seldom transcended the simplest routine, that there was\r\nlittle else than the next Presidency to be thought or talked of. The\r\nrivalship for this, as has been said, was based not upon conflicting\r\ntheories concerning public affairs, but solely upon individual\r\npreference for one or another of four men no one of whom at that\r\nmoment represented any great principle in antagonism to any of the\r\nothers. Under no circumstances could the temptation to petty intrigue\r\nand malicious tale-bearing be greater than when votes were         (p. 164)\r\nto be gained or lost solely by personal predilection. In such a\r\ncontest Adams was severely handicapped as against the showy prestige\r\nof the victorious soldier, the popularity of the brilliant orator, and\r\nthe artfulness of the most dexterous political manager then in public\r\nlife. Long prior to this stage Adams had established his rule of\r\nconduct in the campaign. So early as March, 1818, he was asked one day\r\nby Mr. Everett whether he was \"determined to do nothing with a view to\r\npromote his future election to the Presidency as the successor of Mr.\r\nMonroe,\" and he had replied that he \"should do absolutely nothing.\" To\r\nthis resolution he sturdily adhered. Not a breach of it was ever\r\nbrought home to him, or indeed--save in one instance soon to be\r\nnoticed--seriously charged against him. There is not in the Diary the\r\nfaintest trace of any act which might be so much as questionable or\r\nsusceptible of defence only by casuistry. That he should have\r\nperpetuated evidence of any flagrant misdoing certainly could not be\r\nexpected; but in a record kept with the fulness and frankness of this\r\nDiary we should read between the lines and detect as it were in its\r\ngeneral flavor any taint of disingenuousness or concealment; we should\r\ndiscern moral unwholesomeness in its atmosphere. A thoughtless\r\nsentence would slip from the pen, a sophistical argument would be  (p. 165)\r\nformulated for self-comfort, some acquaintance, interview, or\r\narrangement would slide upon some unguarded page indicative of\r\nundisclosed matters. But there is absolutely nothing of this sort.\r\nThere is no tinge of bad color; all is clear as crystal. Not an\r\neditor, nor a member of Congress, nor a local politician, not even a\r\nprivate individual, was intimidated or conciliated. On the contrary it\r\noften happened that those who made advances, at least sometimes\r\nstimulated by honest friendship, got rebuffs instead of encouragement.\r\nEven after the contest was known to have been transferred to the House\r\nof Representatives, when Washington was actually buzzing with the\r\nceaseless whisperings of many secret conclaves, when the air was thick\r\nwith rumors of what this one had said and that one had done, when, as\r\nWebster said, there were those who pretended to foretell how a\r\nrepresentative would vote from the way in which he put on his hat,\r\nwhen of course stories of intrigue and corruption poisoned the honest\r\nbreeze, and when the streets seemed traversed only by the busy tread\r\nof the go-betweens, the influential friends, the wire-pullers of the\r\nvarious contestants,--still amid all this noisy excitement and extreme\r\ntemptation Mr. Adams held himself almost wholly aloof, wrapped in the\r\ncloak of his rigid integrity. His proud honesty was only not quite (p. 166)\r\nrepellent; he sometimes allowed himself to answer questions\r\ncourteously, and for a brief period held in check his strong natural\r\npropensity to give offence and make enemies. This was the uttermost\r\nlength that he could go towards political corruption. He became for a\r\nfew weeks tolerably civil of speech, which after all was much for him\r\nto do and doubtless cost him no insignificant effort. Since the days\r\nof Washington he alone presents the singular spectacle of a candidate\r\nfor the Presidency deliberately taking the position, and in a long\r\ncampaign really never flinching from it: \"that, if the people wish me\r\nto be President I shall not refuse the office; but I ask nothing from\r\nany man or from any body of men.\"\r\n\r\nYet though he declined to be a courtier of popular favor he did not\r\nconceal from himself or from others the chagrin which he would feel if\r\nthere should be a manifestation of popular disfavor. Before the\r\npopular election he stated that if it should go against him he should\r\nconstrue it as the verdict of the people that they were dissatisfied\r\nwith his services as a public man, and he should then retire to\r\nprivate life, no longer expecting or accepting public functions. He\r\ndid not regard politics as a struggle in which, if he should now   (p. 167)\r\nbe beaten in one encounter, he would return to another in the hope\r\nof better success in time. His notion was that the people had had\r\nample opportunity during his incumbency in appointive offices to\r\nmeasure his ability and understand his character, and that the action\r\nof the people in electing or not electing him to the Presidency would\r\nbe an indication that they were satisfied or dissatisfied with him. In\r\nthe latter event he had nothing more to seek. Politics did not\r\nconstitute a profession or career in which he felt entitled to persist\r\nin seeking personal success as he might in the law or in business.\r\nNeither did the circumstances of the time place him in the position of\r\nan advocate of any great principle which he might feel it his duty to\r\nrepresent and to fight for against any number of reverses. No such\r\nelement was present at this time in national affairs. He construed the\r\nquestion before the people simply as concerning their opinion of him.\r\nHe was much too proud to solicit and much too honest to scheme for a\r\nfavorable expression. It was a singular and a lofty attitude even if a\r\ntrifle egotistical and not altogether unimpeachable by argument. It\r\ncould not diminish but rather it intensified his interest in a contest\r\nwhich he chose to regard not simply as a struggle for a glittering (p. 168)\r\nprize but as a judgment upon the services which he had been for a\r\nlifetime rendering to his countrymen.\r\n\r\nHow profoundly his whole nature was moved by the position in which he\r\nstood is evident, often almost painfully, in the Diary. Any attempt to\r\nconceal his feeling would be idle, and he makes no such attempt. He\r\nrepeats all the rumors which come to his ears; he tells the stories\r\nabout Crawford's illness; he records his own temptations; he tries\r\nhard to nerve himself to bear defeat philosophically by constantly\r\npredicting it; indeed, he photographs his whole existence for many\r\nweeks; and however eagerly any person may aspire to the Presidency of\r\nthe United States there is little in the picture to make one long for\r\nthe preliminary position of candidate for that honor. It is too much\r\nlike the stake and the flames through which the martyr passed to\r\neternal beatitude, with the difference as against the candidate that\r\nhe has by no means the martyr's certainty of reward.\r\n\r\nIn those days of slow communication it was not until December, 1824,\r\nthat it became everywhere known that there had been no election of a\r\npresident by the people. When the Electoral College met the result of\r\ntheir ballots was as follows:--\r\n\r\n  General Jackson led with   99 votes.                             (p. 169)\r\n  Adams followed with        84   \"\r\n  Crawford had               41   \"\r\n  Clay had                   37   \"\r\n                            ---\r\n  Total                     261 votes.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun was elected Vice-President by the handsome number of 182\r\nvotes.\r\n\r\nThis condition of the election had been quite generally anticipated;\r\nyet Mr. Adams's friends were not without some feeling of\r\ndisappointment. They had expected for him a fair support at the South,\r\nwhereas he in fact received seventy-seven out of his eighty-four votes\r\nfrom New York and New England; Maryland gave him three, Louisiana gave\r\nhim two, Delaware and Illinois gave him one each.\r\n\r\nWhen the electoral body was known to be reduced within the narrow\r\nlimits of the House of Representatives, intrigue was rather stimulated\r\nthan diminished by the definiteness which became possible for it. Mr.\r\nClay, who could not come before the House, found himself transmuted\r\nfrom a candidate to a President-maker; for it was admitted by all that\r\nhis great personal influence in Congress would almost undoubtedly\r\nconfer success upon the aspirant whom he should favor. Apparently his\r\npredilections were at least possibly in favor of Crawford; but     (p. 170)\r\nCrawford's health had been for many months very bad; he had had a\r\nsevere paralytic stroke, and when acting as Secretary of the Treasury\r\nhe had been unable to sign his name, so that a stamp or die had been\r\nused; his speech was scarcely intelligible; and when Mr. Clay visited\r\nhim in the retirement in which his friends now kept him, the fact\r\ncould not be concealed that he was for the time at least a wreck. Mr.\r\nClay therefore had to decide for himself, his followers, and the\r\ncountry whether Mr. Adams or General Jackson should be the next\r\nPresident of the United States. A cruel attempt was made in this\r\ncrisis either to destroy his influence by blackening his character, or\r\nto intimidate him, through fear of losing his reputation for\r\nintegrity, into voting for Jackson. An anonymous letter charged that\r\nthe friends of Clay had hinted that, \"like the Swiss, they would fight\r\nfor those who pay best;\" that they had offered to elect Jackson if he\r\nwould agree to make Clay Secretary of State, and that upon his\r\nindignant refusal to make such a bargain the same proposition had been\r\nmade to Mr. Adams, who was found less scrupulous and had promptly\r\nformed the \"unholy coalition.\" This wretched publication, made a few\r\ndays before the election in the House, was traced to a dull-witted\r\nPennsylvania Representative by the name of Kremer, who had         (p. 171)\r\nobviously been used as a tool by cleverer men. It met, however, the\r\nfate which seems happily always to attend such ignoble devices, and\r\nfailed utterly of any more important effect than the utter\r\nannihilation of Kremer. In truth, General Jackson's fate had been\r\nsealed from the instant when it had fallen into Mr. Clay's hands. Clay\r\nhad long since expressed his unfavorable opinion of the \"military\r\nhero,\" in terms too decisive to admit of explanation or retraction.\r\nWithout much real liking for Adams, Clay at least disliked him much\r\nless than he did Jackson, and certainly his honest judgment favored\r\nthe civilian far more than the disorderly soldier whose lawless career\r\nin Florida had been the topic of some of the great orator's fiercest\r\ninvective. The arguments founded on personal fitness were strongly\r\nupon the side of Adams, and other arguments advanced by the Jacksonians\r\ncould hardly deceive Clay. They insisted that their candidate was the\r\nchoice of the people so far as a superiority of preference had been\r\nindicated, and that therefore he ought to be also the choice of the\r\nHouse of Representatives. It would be against the spirit of the\r\nConstitution and a thwarting of the popular will, they said, to prefer\r\neither of his competitors. The fallacy of this reasoning, if reasoning\r\nit could be called, was glaring. If the spirit of the Constitution (p. 172)\r\nrequired the House of Representatives not to _elect_ from three\r\ncandidates before it, but only to induct an individual into the\r\nPresidency by a process which was in form voting but in fact only a\r\nsimple certification that he had received the highest number of\r\nelectoral votes, it would have been a plain and easy matter for the\r\nletter of the Constitution to have expressed this spirit, or indeed to\r\nhave done away altogether with this machinery of a sham election. The\r\nJackson men had only to state their argument in order to expose its\r\nhollowness; for they said substantially that the Constitution\r\nestablished an election without an option; that the electors were to\r\nvote for a person predestined by an earlier occurrence to receive\r\ntheir ballots. But besides their unsoundness in argument, their\r\nstatistical position was far from being what they undertook to\r\nrepresent it. The popular vote had been so light that it really looked\r\nas though the people had cared very little which candidate should\r\nsucceed; and to talk about a manifestation of the _popular will_ was\r\nabsurd, for the only real manifestation had been of popular\r\nindifference. For example, in 1823 Massachusetts had cast upwards of\r\n66,000 votes in the state election, whereas in this national election\r\nshe cast only a trifle more than 37,000. Virginia distributed      (p. 173)\r\na total of less than 15,000 among all four candidates. Pluralities did\r\nnot signify much in such a condition of sentiment as was indicated by\r\nthese figures. Moreover, in six States, viz., Vermont, New York,\r\nDelaware, South Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana, the electors were chosen\r\nby the legislatures, not by the people; so that there was no correct\r\nway of counting them at all in a discussion of pluralities. Guesses\r\nand approximations favored Adams, and to an important degree; for\r\nthese six States gave to Adams thirty-six votes, to Jackson nineteen,\r\nto Crawford six, to Clay four. In New York, Jackson had hardly an\r\nappreciable following. Moreover, in other States many thousands of\r\nvotes which had been \"cast for no candidate in particular, but in\r\nopposition to the caucus ticket generally,\" were reckoned as if they\r\nhad been cast for Jackson or against Adams, as suited the especial\r\ncase. Undoubtedly Jackson did have a plurality, but undoubtedly it\r\nfell very far short of the imposing figure, nearly 48,000, which his\r\nsupporters had the audacity to name.\r\n\r\nThe election took place in the House on February 9, 1825. Daniel\r\nWebster and John Randolph were tellers, and they reported that there\r\nwere \"for John Quincy Adams, of Massachusetts, thirteen votes; for\r\nAndrew Jackson, of Tennessee, seven votes; for William H. Crawford,\r\nof Georgia, four votes.\" Thereupon the speaker announced Mr. Adams (p. 174)\r\nto have been elected President of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis end of an unusually exciting contest thus left Mr. Adams in\r\npossession of the field, Mr. Crawford the victim of an irretrievable\r\ndefeat, Mr. Clay still hopeful and aspiring for a future which had\r\nonly disappointment in store for him, General Jackson enraged and\r\nrevengeful. Not even Mr. Adams was fully satisfied. When the committee\r\nwaited upon him to inform him of the election, he referred in his\r\nreply to the peculiar state of things and said, \"could my refusal to\r\naccept the trust thus delegated to me give an opportunity to the\r\npeople to form and to express with a nearer approach to unanimity the\r\nobject of their preference, I should not hesitate to decline the\r\nacceptance of this eminent charge and to submit the decision of this\r\nmomentous question again to their decision.\" That this singular and\r\nstriking statement was made in good faith is highly probable. William\r\nH. Seward says that it was \"unquestionably uttered with great\r\nsincerity of heart.\" The test of action of course could not be\r\napplied, since the resignation of Mr. Adams would only have made Mr.\r\nCalhoun President, and could not have been so arranged as to bring\r\nabout a new election. Otherwise the course of his argument would   (p. 175)\r\nhave been clear; the fact that such action involved an enormous\r\nsacrifice would have been to his mind strong evidence that it was a\r\nduty; and the temptation to perform a duty, always strong with him,\r\nbecame ungovernable if the duty was exceptionally disagreeable. Under\r\nthe circumstances, however, the only logical conclusion lay in the\r\ninauguration, which took place in the customary simple fashion on\r\nMarch 4, 1825. Mr. Adams, we are told, was dressed in a black suit, of\r\nwhich all the materials were wholly of American manufacture. Prominent\r\namong those who after the ceremony hastened to greet him and to shake\r\nhands with him appeared General Jackson. It was the last time that any\r\nfriendly courtesy is recorded as having passed between the two.\r\n\r\nMany men eminent in public affairs have had their best years embittered\r\nby their failure to secure the glittering prize of the Presidency. Mr.\r\nAdams is perhaps the only person to whom the gaining of that proud\r\ndistinction has been in some measure a cause of chagrin. This strange\r\nsentiment, which he undoubtedly felt, was due to the fact that what he\r\nhad wished was not the office in and for itself, but the office as a\r\nsymbol or token of the popular approval. He had held important and\r\nresponsible public positions during substantially his whole active (p. 176)\r\nlife; he was nearly sixty years old, and, as he said, he now for the\r\nfirst time had an opportunity to find out in what esteem the people of\r\nthe country held him. What he wished was that the people should now\r\nexpress their decided satisfaction with him. This he hardly could be\r\nsaid to have obtained; though to be the choice of a plurality in the\r\nnation and then to be selected by so intelligent a body of\r\nconstituents as the Representatives of the United States involved a\r\npeculiar sanction, yet nothing else could fully take the place of that\r\nnational indorsement which he had coveted. When men publicly profess\r\nmodest depreciation of their successes they are seldom believed; but\r\nin his private Diary Mr. Adams wrote, on December 31, 1825:--\r\n\r\n     \"The year has been the most momentous of those that have passed\r\n     over my head, inasmuch as it has witnessed my elevation at the\r\n     age of fifty-eight to the Chief Magistracy of my country, to the\r\n     summit of laudable or at least blameless worldly ambition; not\r\n     however in a manner satisfactory to pride or to just desire; not\r\n     by the unequivocal suffrages of a majority of the people; with\r\n     perhaps two thirds of the whole people adverse to the actual\r\n     result.\"\r\n\r\nNo President since Washington had ever come into office so entirely\r\nfree from any manner of personal obligations or partisan           (p. 177)\r\nentanglements, express or implied, as did Mr. Adams. Throughout the\r\ncampaign he had not himself, or by any agent, held out any manner of\r\ntacit inducement to any person whomsoever, contingent upon his\r\nelection. He entered upon the Presidency under no indebtedness. He at\r\nonce nominated his Cabinet as follows: Henry Clay, Secretary of State;\r\nRichard Rush, Secretary of the Treasury; James Barbour, Secretary of\r\nWar; Samuel L. Southard, Secretary of the Navy; William Wirt,\r\nAttorney-General. The last two were renominations of the incumbents\r\nunder Monroe. The entire absence of chicanery or the use of influence\r\nin the distribution of offices is well illustrated by the following\r\nincident: On the afternoon following the day of inauguration President\r\nAdams called upon Rufus King, whose term of service as Senator from\r\nNew York had just expired, and who was preparing to leave Washington\r\non the next day. In the course of a conversation concerning the\r\nnominations which had been sent to the Senate that forenoon the\r\nPresident said that he had nominated no minister to the English court,\r\nand\r\n\r\n     \"asked Mr. King if he would accept that mission. His first and\r\n     immediate impulse was to decline it. He said that his\r\n     determination to retire from the public service had been      (p. 178)\r\n     made up, and that this proposal was utterly unexpected to\r\n     him. Of this I was aware; but I urged upon him a variety of\r\n     considerations to induce his acceptance of it.... I dwelt with\r\n     earnestness upon all these motives, and apparently not without\r\n     effect. He admitted the force of them, and finally promised fully\r\n     to consider of the proposal before giving me a definite answer.\"\r\n\r\nThe result was an acceptance by Mr. King, his nomination by the\r\nPresident, and confirmation by the Senate. He was an old Federalist,\r\nto whom Mr. Adams owed no favors. With such directness and simplicity\r\nwere the affairs of the Republic conducted. It is a quaint and\r\npleasing scene from the period of our forefathers: the President,\r\nwithout discussion of \"claims\" to a distinguished and favorite post,\r\nactually selects for it a member of a hostile political organization,\r\nan old man retiring from public life; then quietly walks over to his\r\nhouse, surprises him with the offer, and finding him reluctant\r\nurgently presses upon him arguments to induce his acceptance. But the\r\nwhole business of office-seeking and office-distributing, now so\r\novershadowing, had no place under Mr. Adams. On March 5 he sent in\r\nseveral nominations which were nearly all of previous incumbents.\r\n\"Efforts had been made,\" he writes, \"by some of the senators to obtain\r\ndifferent nominations, and to introduce a principle of change or   (p. 179)\r\nrotation in office at the expiration of these commissions, which would\r\nmake the Government a perpetual and unintermitting scramble for\r\noffice. A more pernicious expedient could scarcely have been\r\ndevised.... I determined to renominate every person against whom there\r\nwas no complaint which would have warranted his removal.\" A notable\r\ninstance was that of Sterret, naval officer at New Orleans, \"a noisy\r\nand clamorous reviler of the Administration,\" and lately busy in a\r\nproject for insulting a Louisiana Representative who had voted for Mr.\r\nAdams. Secretary Clay was urgent for the removal of this man,\r\nplausibly saying that in the cases of persons holding office at the\r\npleasure of the Administration the proper course was to avoid on the\r\none hand political persecution, and on the other any appearance of\r\npusillanimity. Mr. Adams replied that if Sterret had been actually\r\nengaged in insulting a representative for the honest and independent\r\ndischarge of duty, he would make the removal at once. But the design\r\nhad not been consummated, and an _intention_ never carried into effect\r\nwould scarcely justify removal.\r\n\r\n     \"Besides [he added], should I remove this man for this cause it\r\n     must be upon some fixed principle, which would apply to others as\r\n     well as to him. And where was it possible to draw the line?   (p. 180)\r\n     Of the custom-house officers throughout the Union, four fifths\r\n     in all probability were opposed to my election. Crawford,\r\n     Secretary of the Treasury, had distributed these positions among\r\n     his own supporters. I had been urged very earnestly and from\r\n     various quarters to sweep away my opponents and provide with\r\n     their places for my friends. I can justify the refusal to adopt\r\n     this policy only by the steadiness and consistency of my adhesion\r\n     to my own. If I depart from this in one instance I shall be\r\n     called upon by my friends to do the same in many. An invidious\r\n     and inquisitorial scrutiny into the personal dispositions of\r\n     public officers will creep through the whole Union, and the most\r\n     selfish and sordid passions will be kindled into activity to\r\n     distort the conduct and misrepresent the feelings of men whose\r\n     places may become the prize of slander upon them.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clay was silenced, and Sterret retained his position, constituting\r\nthereafter only a somewhat striking instance among many to show that\r\nnothing was to be lost by political opposition to Mr. Adams.\r\n\r\nIt was a cruel and discouraging fatality which brought about that a\r\nman so suicidally upright in the matter of patronage should find that\r\nthe bitterest abuse which was heaped upon him was founded in an\r\nallegation of corruption of precisely this nature. When before the\r\nelection the ignoble George Kremer anonymously charged that        (p. 181)\r\nMr. Clay had sold his friends in the House of Representatives to Mr.\r\nAdams, \"as the planter does his negroes or the farmer his team and\r\nhorses;\" when Mr. Clay promptly published the unknown writer as \"a\r\nbase and infamous calumniator, a dastard and a liar;\" when next\r\nKremer, being unmasked, avowed that he would make good his charges,\r\nbut immediately afterward actually refused to appear or testify before\r\na Committee of the House instructed to investigate the matter, it was\r\nsupposed by all reasonable observers that the outrageous accusation\r\nWas forever laid at rest. But this was by no means the case. The\r\nauthor of the slander had been personally discredited; but the slander\r\nitself had not been destroyed. So shrewdly had its devisers who saw\r\nfuture usefulness in it managed the matter, that while Kremer slunk\r\naway into obscurity, the story which he had told remained an assertion\r\ndenied, but not disproved, still open to be believed by suspicious or\r\nwilling friends. With Adams President and Clay Secretary of State and\r\nGeneral Jackson nominated, as he quickly was by the Tennessee\r\nLegislature, as a candidate for the next Presidential term, the\r\naccusation was too plausible and too tempting to be allowed to fall\r\nforever into dusty death; rather it was speedily exhumed from its\r\nshallow burial and galvanized into new life. The partisans of      (p. 182)\r\nGeneral Jackson sent it to and fro throughout the land. No denial,\r\nno argument, could kill it. It began to gain that sort of half belief\r\nwhich is certain to result from constant repetition; since many minds\r\nare so constituted that truth may be actually, as it were,\r\nmanufactured for them by ceaseless iteration of statement, the many\r\nhearings gaining the character of evidence.\r\n\r\nIt is long since all students of American history, no matter what are\r\ntheir prejudices, or in whose interest their researches are\r\nprosecuted, have branded this accusation as devoid of even the most\r\nshadowy basis of probability, and it now gains no more credit than\r\nwould a story that Adams, Clay, and Jackson had conspired together to\r\nget Crawford out of their way by assassination, and that his paralysis\r\nwas the result of the drugs and potions administered in performance of\r\nthis foul plot. But for a while the rumor stalked abroad among the\r\npeople, and many conspicuously bowed down before it because it served\r\ntheir purpose, and too many others also, it must be confessed, did\r\nlikewise because they were deceived and really believed it. Even the\r\nlegislature of Tennessee were not ashamed to give formal countenance\r\nto a calumny in support of which not a particle of evidence had ever\r\nbeen adduced. In a preamble to certain resolutions passed by this  (p. 183)\r\nbody upon this subject in 1827, it was recited that: \"Mr. Adams\r\ndesired the office of President; he went into the combination without\r\nit, and came out with it. Mr. Clay desired that of Secretary of State;\r\nhe went into the combination without it, and came out with it.\" No\r\nother charge could have wounded Mr. Adams so keenly; yet no course was\r\nopen to him for refuting the slander. Mr. Clay, beside himself with a\r\njust rage, was better able to fight after the fashion of the day--if\r\nindeed he could only find somebody to fight. This he did at last in\r\nthe person of John Randolph, of Roanoke, who adverted in one of his\r\nrambling and vituperative harangues to \"the coalition of Blifil and\r\nBlack George--the combination unheard of till then of the Puritan and\r\nthe black-leg.\" This language led naturally enough to a challenge from\r\nMr. Clay. The parties met[6] and exchanged shots without result. The\r\npistols were a second time loaded; Clay fired; Randolph fired into the\r\nair, walked up to Clay and without a word gave him his hand, which\r\nClay had as it were perforce to take. There was no injury done save to\r\nthe skirts of Randolph's long flannel coat which were pierced by one\r\nof the bullets.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6: April 8, 1826.]\r\n\r\nBy way of revenge a duel may be effective if the wrong man does    (p. 184)\r\nnot happen to get shot; but as evidence for intelligent men a bloodier\r\nending than this would have been inconclusive. It so happened,\r\nhowever, that Jackson, altogether contrary to his own purpose, brought\r\nconclusive aid to President Adams and Secretary Clay. Whether the\r\nGeneral ever had any real faith in the charge can only be surmised.\r\nNot improbably he did, for his mental workings were so peculiar in\r\ntheir violence and prejudice that apparently he always sincerely\r\nbelieved all persons who crossed his path to be knaves and villains of\r\nthe blackest dye. But certain it is that whether he credited the tale\r\nor not he soon began to devote himself with all his wonted vigor and\r\npertinacity to its wide dissemination. Whether in so doing he was\r\nstupidly believing a lie, or intentionally spreading a known slander,\r\nis a problem upon which his friends and biographers have exhausted\r\nmuch ingenuity without reaching any certain result. But sure it is\r\nthat early in the year 1827 he was so far carried beyond the bounds of\r\nprudence as to declare before many persons that he had proof of the\r\ncorrupt bargain. The assertion was promptly sent to the newspapers by\r\na Mr. Carter Beverly, one of those who heard it made in the presence\r\nof several guests at the Hermitage. The name of Mr. Beverly, at first\r\nconcealed, soon became known, and he was of course compelled to    (p. 185)\r\nvouch in his principal. General Jackson never deserted his adherents,\r\nwhether their difficulties were noble or ignoble. He came gallantly to\r\nthe aid of Mr. Beverly, and in a letter of June 6 declared that early\r\nin January, 1825, he had been visited by a \"member of Congress of high\r\nrespectability,\" who had told him of \"a great intrigue going on\" of\r\nwhich he ought to be informed. This gentleman had then proceeded to\r\nexplain that Mr. Clay's friends were afraid that if General Jackson\r\nshould be elected President, \"Mr. Adams would be continued Secretary\r\nof State (innuendo, there would be no room for Kentucky); that if I\r\nwould say, or permit any of my confidential friends to say, that in\r\ncase I were elected President, Mr. Adams should not be continued\r\nSecretary of State, by a complete union of Mr. Clay and his friends\r\nthey would put an end to the Presidential contest in one hour. And he\r\nwas of opinion it was right to fight such intriguers with their own\r\nweapons.\" This scarcely disguised suggestion of bargain and corruption\r\nthe General said that he repudiated indignantly. Clay at once publicly\r\nchallenged Jackson to produce some evidence--to name the \"respectable\"\r\nmember of Congress who appeared in the very unrespectable light of (p. 186)\r\nadvising a candidate for the Presidency to emulate the alleged\r\nbaseness of his opponents. Jackson thereupon uncovered James Buchanan,\r\nof Pennsylvania. Mr. Buchanan was a friend of the General, and to what\r\npoint it may have been expected or hoped that his allegiance would\r\ncarry him in support of his chief in this dire hour of extremity is\r\nmatter only of inference. Fortunately, however, his fealty does not\r\nappear to have led him any great distance from the truth. He yielded\r\nto the prevailing desire to pass along the responsibility to some one\r\nelse so far as to try to bring in a Mr. Markley, who, however, never\r\nbecame more than a dumb figure in the drama in which Buchanan was\r\nobliged to remain as the last important character. With obvious\r\nreluctance this gentleman then wrote that if General Jackson had\r\nplaced any such construction as the foregoing upon an interview which\r\nhad occurred between them, and which he recited at length, then the\r\nGeneral had totally misconstrued--as was evident enough--what he, Mr.\r\nBuchanan, had said. Indeed, that Jackson could have supposed him to\r\nentertain the sentiments imputed to him made Mr. Buchanan, as he said,\r\n\"exceedingly unhappy.\" In other words, there was no foundation\r\nwhatsoever for the charge thus traced back to an originator who denied\r\nhaving originated it and said that it was all a mistake. General   (p. 187)\r\nJackson was left to be defended from the accusation of deliberate\r\nfalsehood only by the charitable suggestion that he had been unable to\r\nunderstand a perfectly simple conversation. Apparently Mr. Adams and\r\nMr. Clay ought now to be abundantly satisfied, since not only were\r\nthey amply vindicated, but their chief vilifier seemed to have been\r\npierced by the point which he had sharpened for them. They had yet,\r\nhowever, to learn what vitality there is in falsehood.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson and his friends had alone played any active part in\r\nthis matter. Of these friends Mr. Kremer had written a letter of\r\nretraction and apology which he was with difficulty prevented from\r\npublishing; Mr. Buchanan had denied all that he had been summoned to\r\nprove; a few years later Mr. Beverly wrote and sent to Mr. Clay a\r\ncontrite letter of regret. General Jackson alone remained for the rest\r\nof his life unsilenced, obstinately reiterating a charge disproved by\r\nhis own witnesses. But worse than all this, accumulations of evidence\r\nlong and laboriously sought in many quarters have established a\r\ntolerably strong probability that advances of precisely the character\r\nalleged against Mr. Adams's friends were made to Mr. Clay by the most\r\nintimate personal associates of General Jackson. The discussion    (p. 188)\r\nof this unpleasant suspicion would not, however, be an excusable\r\nepisode in this short volume. The reader who is curious to pursue the\r\nmatter further will find all the documentary evidence collected in its\r\noriginal shape in the first volume of Colton's \"Life of Clay,\"\r\naccompanied by an argument needlessly elaborate and surcharged with\r\nfeeling yet in the main sufficiently fair and exhaustive.\r\n\r\nMr. Benton says that \"no President could have commenced his administration\r\nunder more unfavorable auspices, or with less expectation of a popular\r\ncareer,\" than did Mr. Adams. From the first a strong minority in the\r\nHouse of Representatives was hostile to him, and the next election\r\nmade this a majority. The first indication of the shape which the\r\nopposition was to take became visible in the vote in the Senate upon\r\nconfirming Mr. Clay as Secretary of State. There were fourteen nays\r\nagainst twenty-seven yeas, and an inspection of the list showed that\r\nthe South was beginning to consolidate more closely than heretofore as\r\na sectional force in politics. The formation of a Southern party\r\ndistinctly organized in the interests of slavery, already apparent in\r\nthe unanimity of the Southern Electoral Colleges against Mr. Adams,\r\nthus received further illustration; and the skilled eye of the     (p. 189)\r\nPresident noted \"the rallying of the South and of Southern interests\r\nand prejudices to the men of the South.\" It is possible now to see\r\nplainly that Mr. Adams was really the first leader in the long crusade\r\nagainst slavery; it was in opposition to him that the South became a\r\npolitical unit; and a true instinct taught him the trend of Southern\r\npolitics long before the Northern statesmen apprehended it, perhaps\r\nbefore even any Southern statesman had distinctly formulated it. This\r\nnew development in the politics of the country soon received further\r\nillustration. The first message which Mr. Adams had occasion to send\r\nto Congress gave another opportunity to his ill-wishers. Therein he\r\nstated that the invitation which had been extended to the United\r\nStates to be represented at the Congress of Panama had been accepted,\r\nand that he should commission ministers to attend the meeting. Neither\r\nin matter nor in manner did this proposition contain any just element\r\nof offence. It was customary for the Executive to initiate new\r\nmissions simply by the nomination of envoys to fill them; and in such\r\ncase the Senate, if it did not think the suggested mission desirable,\r\ncould simply decline to confirm the nomination upon that ground. An\r\nexample of this has been already seen in the two nominations of Mr.\r\nAdams himself to the Court of Russia in the Presidency of Mr.      (p. 190)\r\nMadison. But now vehement assaults were made upon the President,\r\nalike in the Senate and in the House, on the utterly absurd ground\r\nthat he had transcended his powers. Incredible, too, as it may seem at\r\nthis day it was actually maintained that there was no occasion\r\nwhatsoever for the United States to desire representation at such a\r\ngathering. Prolonged and bitter was the opposition which the\r\nAdministration was compelled to encounter in a measure to which there\r\nso obviously ought to have been instant assent if considered solely\r\nupon its intrinsic merits, but upon which nevertheless the discussion\r\nactually overshadowed all other questions which arose during the\r\nsession. The President had the good fortune to find the powerful aid\r\nof Mr. Webster enlisted in his behalf, and ultimately he prevailed;\r\nbut it was of ill augury at this early date to see that personal\r\nhostility was so widespread and so rancorous that it could make such a\r\nprolonged and desperate resistance with only the faintest pretext of\r\nright as a basis for its action. Yet a great and fundamental cause of\r\nthe feeling manifested lay hidden away beneath the surface in the\r\ninstinctive antipathy of the slaveholders to Mr. Adams and all his\r\nthoughts, his ways, and his doings. For into this question of      (p. 191)\r\ncountenancing the Panama Congress, slavery and \"the South\" entered and\r\nimported into a portion of the opposition a certain element of\r\nreasonableness and propriety in a political sense. When we see the\r\nSouthern statesmen banded against President Adams in these debates, as\r\nwe know the future which was hidden from them, it almost makes us\r\nbelieve that their vindictiveness was justified by an instinctive\r\nforecasting of his character and his mission in life, and that without\r\nknowing it they already felt the influence of the acts which he was\r\nyet to do against them. For the South, without present dread of an\r\nabolition movement, yet hated this Panama Congress with a contemptuous\r\nloathing not alone because the South American states had freed all\r\nslaves within their limits, but because there was actually a fair\r\nchance that Hayti would be admitted to representation at the sessions\r\nas a sovereign state. That the President of the United States should\r\npropose to send white citizens of that country to sit cheek by jowl on\r\nterms of official equality with the revolted blacks of Hayti fired the\r\nSouthern heart with rage inexpressible. The proposition was a further\r\ninfusion of cement to aid in the Southern consolidation so rapidly\r\ngoing forward, and was substantially the beginning of the sense of\r\npersonal alienation henceforth to grow steadily more bitter on     (p. 192)\r\nthe part of the slaveholders towards Mr. Adams. Without designing\r\nit he had struck the first blow in a fight which was to absorb his\r\nenergies for the rest of his life.\r\n\r\nSuch evil forebodings as might too easily be drawn from the course of\r\nthis debate were soon and amply fulfilled. The opposition increased\r\nrapidly until when Congress came together in December, 1827, it had\r\nattained overshadowing proportions. Not only was a member of that\r\nparty elected Speaker of the House of Representatives, but a decided\r\nmajority of both Houses of Congress was arrayed against the\r\nAdministration--\"a state of things which had never before occurred\r\nunder the Government of the United States.\" All the committees too\r\nwere composed of four opposition and only three Administration\r\nmembers. With more exciting issues this relationship of the executive\r\nand legislative departments might have resulted in dangerous collisions;\r\nbut in this season of political quietude it only made the position of\r\nthe President extremely uncomfortable. Mr. Van Buren soon became\r\nrecognized as the formidable leader and organizer of the Jackson\r\nforces. His capacity as a political strategist was so far in advance\r\nof that of any other man of those times that it might have secured\r\nsuccess even had he been encountered by tactics similar to his     (p. 193)\r\nown. But since on the contrary he had only to meet straightforward\r\nsimplicity, it was soon apparent that he would have everything his own\r\nway. It was disciplined troops against the militia of honest merchants\r\nand farmers; and the result was not to be doubted. Mr. Adams and his\r\nfriends were fond of comparing Van Buren with Aaron Burr, though\r\npredicting that he would be too shrewd to repeat Burr's blunders. From\r\nthe beginning they declined to meet with his own weapons a man whom\r\nthey so contemned. It was about this time that a new nomenclature of\r\nparties was introduced into our politics. The administrationists\r\ncalled themselves National Republicans, a name which in a few years\r\nwas changed for that of Whigs, while the opposition or Jacksonians\r\nwere known as Democrats, a title which has been ever since retained by\r\nthe same party.\r\n\r\nThe story of Mr. Adams's Administration will detain the historian, and\r\neven the biographer, only a very short time. Not an event occurred\r\nduring those four years which appears of any especial moment. Our\r\nforeign relations were all pacific; and no grave crisis or great issue\r\nwas developed in domestic affairs. It was a period of tranquillity, in\r\nwhich the nation advanced rapidly in prosperity. For many years dulness\r\nhad reigned in business, but returning activity was encouraged by  (p. 194)\r\nthe policy of the new Government, and upon all sides various\r\nindustries became active and thriving. So far as the rule of Mr. Adams\r\nwas marked by any distinguishing characteristic, it was by a care for\r\nthe material welfare of the people. More commercial treaties were\r\nnegotiated during his Administration than in the thirty-six years\r\npreceding his inauguration. He was a strenuous advocate of internal\r\nimprovements, and happily the condition of the national finances\r\nenabled the Government to embark in enterprises of this kind. He\r\nsuggested many more than were undertaken, but not perhaps more than it\r\nwould have been quite possible to carry out. He was always chary of\r\nmaking a show of himself before the people for the sake of gaining\r\npopularity. When invited to attend the annual exhibition of the\r\nMaryland Agricultural Society, shortly after his inauguration, he\r\ndeclined, and wrote in his Diary: \"To gratify this wish I must give\r\nfour days of my time, no trifle of expense, and set a precedent for\r\nbeing claimed as an article of exhibition at all the cattle-shows\r\nthroughout the Union.\" Other gatherings would prefer equally\r\nreasonable demands, in responding to which \"some duty must be\r\nneglected.\" But the opening of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal was an\r\nevent sufficiently momentous and national in its character to      (p. 195)\r\njustify the President's attendance. He was requested in the presence\r\nof a great concourse of people to dig the first shovelful of earth and\r\nto make a brief address. The speech-making was easy; but when the\r\ndigging was to be done he encountered some unexpected obstacle and the\r\nsoil did not yield to his repeated efforts. Not to be defeated,\r\nhowever, he stripped off his coat, went to work in earnest with the\r\nspade and raised the earth successfully. Naturally such readiness was\r\nhailed with loud applause and pleased the great crowd who saw it. But\r\nin Mr. Adams's career it was an exceptional occurrence that enabled\r\nhim to conciliate a momentary popularity; it was seldom that he\r\nenjoyed or used an opportunity of gaining the cheap admiration or\r\nshallow friendship of the multitude.\r\n\r\nAt least one moral to be drawn from the story of Mr. Adams's\r\nPresidency perhaps deserves rather to be called an _immoral_, and\r\ncertainly furnishes unwelcome support to those persons who believe\r\nthat conscientiousness is out of place in politics. It has been said\r\nthat no sooner was General Jackson fairly defeated than he was again\r\nbefore the people as a candidate for the next election. An opposition\r\nto the new Administration was in process of formation actually before\r\nthere had been time for that Administration to declare, much less  (p. 196)\r\nto carry out, any policy or even any measure. The opposition was\r\ntherefore not one of principle; it was not dislike of anything done or\r\nto be done; it did not pretend to have a purpose of saving the people\r\nfrom blunders or of offering them greater advantages. It was simply an\r\nopposition, or more properly an hostility, to the President and his\r\nCabinet, and was conducted by persons who wished in as short a time as\r\npossible themselves to control and fill those positions. The sole\r\nground upon which these opponents stood was, that they would rather\r\nhave General Jackson at the head of affairs than Mr. Adams. The issue\r\nwas purely personal; it was so when the opposition first developed,\r\nand it remained so until that opposition triumphed.\r\n\r\nUnder no circumstances can it be more excusable for an elective\r\nmagistrate to seek personal good will towards himself than when his\r\nrival seeks to supplant him simply on the basis of enjoying a greater\r\nmeasure of such good will. Had any important question of policy been\r\ndividing the people, it would have been easy for a man of less moral\r\ncourage and independence than belonged to Mr. Adams to select the side\r\nwhich he thought right, and to await the outcome at least with\r\nconstancy. But the only real question raised was this: will Mr. Adams\r\nor General Jackson--two individuals representing as yet no         (p. 197)\r\nantagonistic policies--be preferred by the greater number of voters in\r\n1829? If, however, there was no great apparent issue open between\r\nthese two men, at least there was a very wide difference between their\r\ncharacters, a point of some consequence in a wholly personal\r\ncompetition. It is easy enough now to see how this gaping difference\r\ndisplayed itself from the beginning, and how the advantage for winning\r\nwas throughout wholly on the side of Jackson. The course to be pursued\r\nby Mr. Adams in order to insure victory was obvious enough; being\r\nsimply to secure the largest following and most efficient support\r\npossible. The arts by which these objects were to be attained were not\r\nobscure nor beyond his power. If he wished a second term, as beyond\r\nquestion he did, two methods were of certain utility. He should make\r\nthe support of his Administration a source of profit to the\r\nsupporters; and he should conciliate good will by every means that\r\noffered. To the former end what more efficient means could be devised\r\nthan a body of office-holders owing their positions to his appointment\r\nand likely to have the same term of office as himself? His neglect to\r\ncreate such a corps of stanch supporters cannot be explained on the\r\nground that so plain a scheme of perpetuating power had not then   (p. 198)\r\nbeen devised in the Republic. Mr. Jefferson had practised it, to an\r\nextent which now seems moderate, but which had been sufficiently\r\nextensive to deprive any successor of the honor of novelty in originating\r\nit. The times were ripe for it, and the nation would not have revolted\r\nat it, as was made apparent when General Jackson, succeeding Mr.\r\nAdams, at once carried out the system with a thoroughness that has\r\nnever been surpassed, and with a success in achieving results so great\r\nthat almost no politician has since failed to have recourse to the\r\nsame practice. Suggestions and temptations, neither of which were\r\nwanting, were however alike thrown away upon Mr. Adams. Friendship or\r\nhostility to the President were the only two matters which were sure\r\nto have no effect whatsoever upon the fate of an incumbent or an\r\naspirant. Scarcely any removals were made during his Administration,\r\nand every one of the few was based solely upon a proved unfitness of\r\nthe official. As a consequence very few new appointments were made,\r\nand in every instance the appointee was, or was believed to be, the\r\nfittest man without regard to his political bias. This entire\r\nelimination of the question of party allegiance from every department\r\nof the public service was not a specious protestation, but an\r\nundeniable fact at which friends grumbled bitterly, and upon which (p. 199)\r\nfoes counted often with an ungenerous but always with an implicit\r\nreliance. It was well known, for example, that in the Customs\r\nDepartment there were many more avowed opponents than supporters of\r\nthe Administration. What was to be thought, the latter angrily asked,\r\nof a president who refused to make any distinction between the sheep\r\nand the goats? But while Mr. Adams, unmoved by argument, anger, or\r\nentreaty, thus alienated many and discouraged all, every one was made\r\nacquainted with the antipodal principles of his rival. The consequence\r\nwas inevitable; many abandoned Adams from sheer irritation; multitudes\r\nbecame cool and indifferent concerning him; the great number of those\r\nwhose political faith was so weak as to be at the ready command of\r\ntheir own interests, or the interests of a friend or relative, yielded\r\nto a pressure against which no counteracting force was employed. In a\r\nword, no one who had not a strong and independent personal conviction\r\nin behalf of Mr. Adams found the slightest inducement to belong to his\r\nparty. It did not require much political sagacity to see that in quiet\r\ntimes, with no great issue visibly at stake, a following thus composed\r\ncould not include a majority of the nation. It is true that in fact\r\nthere was opening an issue as great as has ever been presented to the\r\nAmerican people,--an issue between government conducted with a     (p. 200)\r\nsole view to efficiency and honesty and government conducted very\r\nlargely, if not exclusively, with a view to individual and party\r\nascendency. The new system afterward inaugurated by General Jackson,\r\ndirectly opposite to that of Mr. Adams and presenting a contrast to it\r\nas wide as is to be found in history, makes this fact glaringly plain\r\nto us. But during the years of Mr. Adams's Administration it was dimly\r\nperceived only by a few. Only one side of the shield had then been\r\nshown. The people did not appreciate that Adams and Jackson were\r\nrepresentatives of two conflicting principles of administration which\r\nwent to the very basis of our system of government. Had the issue been\r\nas apparent and as well understood then as it is now, in retrospect,\r\nthe decision of the nation might have been different. But\r\nunfortunately the voters only beheld two individuals pitted against\r\neach other for the popular suffrage, of whom one, a brilliant soldier,\r\nwould stand by and reward his friends, and the other, an uninteresting\r\ncivilian, ignored all distinction between friend and foe.\r\n\r\nIt was not alone in the refusal to use patronage that Mr. Adams's\r\nrigid conscientiousness showed itself. He was equally obstinate in\r\ndeclining ever to stretch a point however slightly in order to     (p. 201)\r\nwin the favor of any body of the people whether large or small. He\r\nwas warned that his extensive schemes for internal improvement would\r\nalienate especially the important State of Virginia. He could not of\r\ncourse be expected to change his policy out of respect to Virginian\r\nprejudices; but he was advised to mitigate his expression of that\r\npolicy, and to some extent it was open to him to do so. But he would\r\nnot; his utterances went the full length of his opinions, and he\r\npersistently urged upon Congress many plans which he approved, but\r\nwhich he could not have the faintest hopes of seeing adopted. The\r\nconsequence was that he displeased Virginia. He notes the fact in the\r\nDiary in the tone of one who endures persecution for righteousness'\r\nsake, and who means to be very stubborn in his righteousness. Again it\r\nwas suggested to him to embody in one of his messages \"something\r\nsoothing for South Carolina.\" But there stood upon the statute books\r\nof South Carolina an unconstitutional law which had greatly\r\nembarrassed the national government, and which that rebellious little\r\nState with characteristic contumaciousness would not repeal. Under\r\nsuch circumstances, said Mr. Adams, I have no \"soothing\" words for\r\nSouth Carolina.\r\n\r\nIt was not alone by what he did and by what he would not do that   (p. 202)\r\nMr. Adams toiled to insure the election of General Jackson far more\r\nsedulously and efficiently than did the General himself or any of his\r\npartisans. In most cases it was probably the manner quite as much as\r\nthe act which made Mr. Adams unpopular. In his anxiety to be upright\r\nhe was undoubtedly prone to be needlessly disagreeable. His\r\nuncompromising temper put on an ungracious aspect. His conscientiousness\r\nwore the appearance of offensiveness. The Puritanism in his character\r\nwas strongly tinged with that old New England notion that whatever is\r\ndisagreeable is probably right, and that a painful refusal would lose\r\nhalf its merit in being expressed courteously; that a right action\r\nshould never be done in a pleasing way; not only that no pill should\r\nbe sugar-coated, but that the bitterest ingredient should be placed on\r\nthe outside. In repudiating attractive vices the Puritans had rejected\r\nalso those amenities which might have decently concealed or even\r\nmildly decorated the forbidding angularities of a naked Virtue which\r\ncertainly did not imitate the form of any goddess who had ever before\r\nattracted followers. Mr. Adams was a complete and thorough Puritan,\r\nwonderfully little modified by times and circumstances. The ordinary\r\narts of propitiation would have appeared to him only a feeble and\r\ndiluted form of dishonesty; while suavity and graciousness of      (p. 203)\r\ndemeanor would have seemed as unbecoming to this rigid official as\r\nlove-making or wine-bibbing seem to a strait-laced parson. It was\r\ninevitable, therefore, that he should never avert by his words any\r\nill-will naturally caused by his acts; that he should never soothe\r\ndisappointment, or attract calculating selfishness. He was an adept in\r\nalienation, a novice in conciliation. His magnetism was negative. He\r\nmade few friends; and had no interested following whatsoever. No one\r\nwas enthusiastic on his behalf; no band worked for him with the ardor\r\nof personal devotion. His party was composed of those who had\r\nsufficient intelligence to appreciate his integrity and sufficient\r\nhonesty to admire it. These persons respected him, and when election\r\nday came they would vote for him; but they did not canvass zealously\r\nin his behalf, nor do such service for him as a very different kind of\r\nfeeling induced the Jackson men to do for their candidate.[7] The\r\nfervid laborers in politics left Mr. Adams alone in his chilling   (p. 204)\r\nrespectability, and went over to a camp where all scruples were\r\nconsumed in the glowing heat of a campaign conducted upon the single\r\nand simple principle of securing victory.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7: Mr. Mills, in writing of Mr. Adams's\r\n                   inauguration, expressed well what many felt. \"This\r\n                   same President of ours is a man that I can never\r\n                   court nor be on very familiar terms with. There is\r\n                   a cold, repulsive atmosphere about him that is too\r\n                   chilling for my respiration, and I shall certainly\r\n                   keep at a distance from its influence. I wish him\r\n                   God-speed in his Administration, and am heartily\r\n                   disposed to lend him my feeble aid whenever he may\r\n                   need it in a correct course; but he cannot expect\r\n                   me to become his warm and devoted partisan.\" A like\r\n                   sentiment was expressed also much more vigorously\r\n                   by Ezekiel Webster to Daniel Webster, in a letter\r\n                   of February 15, 1829. The writer there attributes\r\n                   the defeat of Mr. Adams to personal dislike to him.\r\n                   People, he said, \"always supported his cause from a\r\n                   cold sense of duty,\" and \"we soon satisfy ourselves\r\n                   that we have discharged our duty to the cause of\r\n                   any man when we do not entertain for him one\r\n                   personal kind feeling, nor cannot unless we\r\n                   disembowel ourselves like a trussed turkey of all\r\n                   that is human nature within us.\" With a candidate\r\n                   \"of popular character, like Mr. Clay,\" the result\r\n                   would have been different. \"The measures of his\r\n                   [Adams's] Administration were just and wise and\r\n                   every honest man should have supported them, but\r\n                   many honest men did not for the reason I have\r\n                   mentioned.\"--_Webster's Private Correspondence_,\r\n                   vol. i. p. 469.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Adams's relations with the members of his Cabinet were friendly\r\nthroughout his term. Men of their character and ability, brought into\r\ndaily contact with him, could not fail to appreciate and admire the\r\npurity of his motives and the patriotism of his conduct; nor was he\r\nwanting in a measure of consideration and deference towards them\r\nperhaps somewhat greater than might have been expected from him,\r\nsometimes even carried to the point of yielding his opinion in     (p. 205)\r\nmatters of consequence. It was his wish that the unity of the body\r\nshould remain unbroken during his four years of office, and the wish\r\nwas very nearly realized. Unfortunately, however, in his last year it\r\nbecame necessary for him to fill the mission to England, and Governor\r\nBarbour was extremely anxious for the place. It was already apparent\r\nthat the coming election was likely to result in the succession of\r\nJackson, and Mr. Adams notes that Barbour's extreme desire to receive\r\nthe appointment was due to his wish to find a good harbor ere the\r\napproaching storm should burst. The remark was made without anger, in\r\nthe tone of a man who had seen enough of the world not to expect too\r\nmuch from any of his fellow men; and the appointment was made,\r\nsomewhat to the chagrin of Webster and Rush, either one of whom would\r\nhave gladly accepted it. The vacancy thus caused, the only one which\r\narose during his term, was filled by General Peter B. Porter, a\r\ngentleman whom Mr. Adams selected not as his own choice, but out of\r\nrespect to the wishes of the Cabinet, and in order to \"terminate the\r\nAdministration in harmony with itself.\" The only seriously unpleasant\r\noccurrence was the treachery of Postmaster-General McLean, who saw fit\r\nto profess extreme devotion to Mr. Adams while secretly aiding General\r\nJackson. His perfidy was not undetected, and great pressure was    (p. 206)\r\nbrought to bear on the President to remove him. Mr. Adams, however,\r\nrefused to do so, and McLean had the satisfaction of stepping from his\r\npost under Mr. Adams into a judgeship conferred by General Jackson,\r\nhaving shown his impartiality and judicial turn of mind, it is to be\r\nsupposed, by declaring his warm allegiance to each master in turn.\r\n\r\nThe picture of President Adams's daily life is striking in its\r\nsimplicity and its laboriousness. This chief magistrate of a great\r\nnation was wont to rise before daybreak, often at four or five o'clock\r\neven in winter, not unfrequently to build and light his own fire, and\r\nto work hard for hours when most persons in busy life were still\r\ncomfortably slumbering. The forenoon and afternoon he devoted to\r\npublic affairs, and often he complains that the unbroken stream of\r\nvisitors gives him little opportunity for hard or continuous labor.\r\nSuch work he was compelled to do chiefly in the evening; and he did\r\nnot always make up for early hours of rising by a correspondingly\r\nearly bedtime; though sometimes in the summer we find him going to bed\r\nbetween eight and nine o'clock, an hour which probably few Presidents\r\nhave kept since then. He strove to care for his health by daily\r\nexercise. In the morning he swam in the Potomac, often for a long  (p. 207)\r\ntime; and more than once he encountered no small risk in this\r\npastime. During the latter part of his Presidential term he tried\r\nriding on horseback. At times when the weather compelled him to walk,\r\nand business was pressing, he used to get his daily modicum of fresh\r\nair before the sun was up. A life of this kind with more of hardship\r\nthan of relaxation in it was ill fitted to sustain in robust health a\r\nman sixty years of age, and it is not surprising that Mr. Adams often\r\ncomplained of feeling ill, dejected, and weary. Yet he never spared\r\nhimself, nor apparently thought his habits too severe, and actually\r\ntoward the close of his term he spoke of his trying daily routine as\r\nconstituting a very agreeable life. He usually began the day by\r\nreading \"two or three chapters in the Bible with Scott's and Hewlett's\r\nCommentaries,\" being always a profoundly religious man of the\r\nold-fashioned school then prevalent in New England.\r\n\r\nIt could hardly have added to the meagre comforts of such a life to be\r\nthreatened with assassination. Yet this danger was thrust upon Mr.\r\nAdams's attention upon one occasion at least under circumstances which\r\ngave to it a very serious aspect. The tranquillity with which he went\r\nthrough the affair showed that his physical courage was as imperturbable\r\nas his moral. The risk was protracted throughout a considerable    (p. 208)\r\nperiod, but he never let it disturb the even tenor of his daily\r\nbehavior or warp his actions in the slightest degree, save only that\r\nwhen he was twice or thrice brought face to face with the intending\r\nassassin he treated the fellow with somewhat more curt brusqueness\r\nthan was his wont. But when the danger was over he bore his would-be\r\nmurderer no malice, and long afterward actually did him a kindly\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFew men in public life have been subjected to trials of temper so\r\nsevere as vexed Mr. Adams during his Presidential term. To play an\r\nintensely exciting game strictly in accordance with rigid moral rules\r\nof the player's own arbitrary enforcement, and which are utterly\r\nrepudiated by a less scrupulous antagonist, can hardly tend to promote\r\ncontentment and amiability. Neither are slanders and falsehoods\r\nmollifying applications to a statesman inspired with an upright and\r\nnoble ambition. Mr. Adams bore such assaults, ranging from the charge\r\nof having corruptly bought the Presidency down to that of being a\r\nFreemason with such grim stoicism as he could command. The\r\ndisappearance and probable assassination of Morgan at this time led to\r\na strong feeling throughout the country against Freemasonry, and   (p. 209)\r\nthe Jackson men at once proclaimed abroad that Adams was one of the\r\nbrotherhood, and offered, if he should deny it, to produce the records\r\nof the lodge to which he belonged. The allegation was false; he was\r\nnot a Mason, and his friends urged him to say so publicly; but he\r\nreplied bitterly that his denial would probably at once be met by a\r\ncomplete set of forged records of a fictitious lodge, and the people\r\nwould not know whom to believe. Next he was said to have bargained for\r\nthe support of Daniel Webster, by promising to distribute offices to\r\nFederalists. This accusation was a cruel perversion of his very\r\nvirtues; for its only foundation lay in the fact that in the\r\nventuresome but honorable attempt to be President of a nation rather\r\nthan of a party, he had in some instances given offices to old\r\nFederalists, certainly with no hope or possibility of reconciling to\r\nhimself the almost useless wreck of that now powerless and shrunken\r\nparty, one of whose liveliest traditions was hatred of him. Stories\r\nwere even set afloat that some of his accounts, since he had been in\r\nthe public service, were incorrect. But the most extraordinary and\r\nridiculous tale of all was that during his residence in Russia he had\r\nprostituted a beautiful American girl, whom he then had in his\r\nservice, in order \"to seduce the passions of the Emperor Alexander (p. 210)\r\nand sway him to political purposes.\"\r\n\r\nThese and other like provocations were not only discouraging but very\r\nirritating, and Mr. Adams was not of that careless disposition which\r\nis little affected by unjust accusation. On the contrary he was\r\ngreatly incensed by such treatment, and though he made the most stern\r\nand persistent effort to endure an inevitable trial with a patience\r\nborn of philosophy, since indifference was not at his command, yet he\r\ncould not refrain from the expression of his sentiments in his secret\r\ncommunings. Occasionally he allowed his wrath to explode with harmless\r\nviolence between the covers of the Diary, and doubtless he found\r\nrelief while he discharged his fierce diatribes on these private\r\nsheets. His vituperative power was great, and some specimens of it may\r\nnot come amiss in a sketch of the man. The senators who did not call\r\nupon him he regarded as of \"rancorous spirit.\" He spoke of the\r\nfalsehoods and misrepresentations which \"the skunks of party slander\r\n... have been ... squirting round the House of Representatives, thence\r\nto issue and perfume the atmosphere of the Union.\" His most intense\r\nhatred and vehement denunciation were reserved for John Randolph, whom\r\nhe thought an abomination too odious and despicable to be described\r\nin words, \"the image and superscription of a great man stamped     (p. 211)\r\nupon base metal.\" \"The besotted violence\" of Randolph, he said, has\r\ndeprived him of \"all right to personal civility from me;\" and\r\ncertainly this excommunication from courtesy was made complete and\r\neffective. He speaks again of the same victim as a \"frequenter of gin\r\nlane and beer alley.\" He indignantly charges that Calhoun, as Speaker,\r\npermitted Randolph \"in speeches of ten hours long to drink himself\r\ndrunk with bottled porter, and in raving balderdash of the meridian of\r\nWapping to revile the absent and the present, the living and the\r\ndead.\" This, he says, was \"tolerated by Calhoun, because Randolph's\r\nribaldry was all pointed against the Administration, especially\r\nagainst Mr. Clay and me.\" Again he writes of Randolph: \"The rancor of\r\nthis man's soul against me is that which sustains his life: the agony\r\nof [his] envy and hatred of me, and the hope of effecting my downfall,\r\nare [his] chief remaining sources of vitality. The issue of the\r\nPresidential election will kill [him] by the gratification of [his]\r\nrevenge.\" So it was also with W. B. Giles, of Virginia. But Giles's\r\nabuse was easier to bear since it had been poured in torrents upon\r\nevery reputable man, from Washington downwards, who had been prominent\r\nin public affairs since the adoption of the Constitution, so that  (p. 212)\r\nGiles's memory is now preserved from oblivion solely by the connection\r\nwhich he established with the great and honorable statesmen of the\r\nRepublic by a course of ceaseless attacks upon them. Some of the\r\nforegoing expressions of Mr. Adams may be open to objection on the\r\nscore of good taste; but the provocation was extreme; public retaliation\r\nhe would not practise, and wrath must sometimes burst forth in\r\nlanguage which was not so unusual in that day as it is at present. It\r\nis an unquestionable fact, of which the credit to Mr. Adams can hardly\r\nbe exaggerated, that he never in any single instance found an excuse\r\nfor an unworthy act on his own part in the fact that competitors or\r\nadversaries were resorting to such expedients.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe election of 1828 gave 178 votes for Jackson and only 83 for Adams.\r\nCalhoun was continued as Vice-President by 171 votes, showing plainly\r\nenough that even yet there were not two political parties, in any\r\ncustomary or proper sense of the phrase. The victory of Jackson had\r\nbeen foreseen by every one. What had been so generally anticipated\r\ncould not take Mr. Adams by surprise; yet it was idle for him to seek\r\nto conceal his disappointment that an Administration which he      (p. 213)\r\nhad conducted with his best ability and with thorough conscientiousness\r\nshould not have seemed to the people worthy of continuance for another\r\nterm. Little suspecting what the future had in store for him, he felt\r\nthat his public career had culminated and probably had closed forever,\r\nand that if it had not closed exactly in disgrace, yet at least it\r\ncould not be regarded as ending gloriously or even satisfactorily. But\r\nhe summoned all his philosophy and fortitude to his aid; he fell back\r\nupon his clear conscience and comported himself with dignity, showing\r\nall reasonable courtesy to his successor and only perhaps seeming a\r\nlittle deficient in filial piety in presenting so striking a contrast\r\nto the shameful conduct of his father in a like crucial hour. His\r\nretirement brought to a close a list of Presidents who deserved to be\r\ncalled statesmen in the highest sense of that term, honorable men,\r\npure patriots, and, with perhaps one exception, all of the first order\r\nof ability in public affairs. It is necessary to come far down towards\r\nthis day before a worthy successor of those great men is met with in\r\nthe list. Dr. Von Holst, by far the ablest writer who has yet dealt\r\nwith American history, says: \"In the person of Adams the last\r\nstatesman who was to occupy it for a long time left the White House.\"\r\nGeneral Jackson, the candidate of the populace and the             (p. 214)\r\nrepresentative hero of the ignorant masses, instituted a new system of\r\nadministering the Government in which personal interests became the\r\nmost important element, and that organization and strategy were\r\ndeveloped which have since become known and infamous under the name of\r\nthe \"political machine.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Adams bore his defeat like a philosopher, he felt secretly\r\nvery depressed and unhappy by reason of it. He speaks of it as leaving\r\nhis \"character and reputation a wreck,\" and says that the \"sun of his\r\npolitical life sets in the deepest gloom.\" On January 1, 1829, he\r\nwrites: \"The year begins in gloom. My wife had a sleepless and painful\r\nnight. The dawn was overcast, and as I began to write my shaded lamp\r\nwent out, self-extinguished. It was only for lack of oil, and the\r\nnotice of so trivial an incident may serve but to mark the present\r\ntemper of my mind.\" It is painful to behold a man of his vigor,\r\nactivity, and courage thus prostrated. Again he writes:--\r\n\r\n     \"Three days more and I shall be restored to private life, and\r\n     left to an old age of retirement though certainly not of repose.\r\n     I go into it with a combination of parties and public men against\r\n     my character and reputation, such as I believe never before was\r\n     exhibited against any man since this Union existed. Posterity\r\n     will scarcely believe it, but so it is, that this combination\r\n     against me has been formed and is now exulting in triumph     (p. 215)\r\n     over me, for the devotion of my life and of all the faculties\r\n     of my soul to the Union, and to the improvement, physical, moral,\r\n     and intellectual of my country.\"\r\n\r\nMelancholy words these to be written by an old man who had worked so\r\nhard and been so honest, and whose ambition had been of the kind that\r\nennobles him who feels it! Could the curtain of the future have been\r\nlifted but for a moment what relief would the glimpse have brought to\r\nhis crushed and wearied spirit. But though coming events may cast\r\nshadows before them, they far less often send bright rays in advance.\r\nSo he now resolved \"to go into the deepest retirement and withdraw\r\nfrom all connection with public affairs.\" Yet it was with regret that\r\nhe foretold this fate, and he looked forward with solicitude to the\r\neffect which such a mode of life, newly entered upon at his age, would\r\nhave upon his mind and character. He hopes rather than dares to\r\npredict that he will be provided \"with useful and profitable\r\noccupation, engaging so much of his thoughts and feelings that his\r\nmind may not be left to corrode itself.\"\r\n\r\nHis return to Quincy held out the less promise of comfort, because the\r\nold chasm between him and the Federalist gentlemen of Boston had been\r\nlately reopened. Certain malicious newspaper paragraphs, born of   (p. 216)\r\nthe mischievous spirit of the wretched Giles, had recently set afloat\r\nsome stories designed seriously to injure Mr. Adams. These were,\r\nsubstantially, that in 1808-9 he had been convinced that some among\r\nthe leaders of the Federalist party in New England were entertaining a\r\nproject for separation from the Union, that he had feared that this\r\nevent would be promoted by the embargo, that he foresaw that the\r\nseceding portion would inevitably be compelled into some sort of\r\nalliance with Great Britain, that he suspected negotiations to this\r\nend to have been already set on foot, that he thereupon gave privately\r\nsome more or less distinct intimations of these notions of his to\r\nsundry prominent Republicans, and even to President Jefferson. These\r\ntales, much distorted from the truth and exaggerated as usual, led to\r\nthe publication of an open letter, in November, 1828, addressed by\r\nthirteen Federalists of note in Massachusetts to John Quincy Adams,\r\ndemanding names and specifications and the production of evidence. Mr.\r\nAdams replied briefly, with dignity, and, considering the\r\ncircumstances, with good temper, stating fairly the substantial import\r\nof what he had really said, declaring that he had never mentioned\r\nnames, and refusing, for good reasons given, either to do so now   (p. 217)\r\nor to publish the grounds of such opinions as he had entertained.\r\nIt was sufficiently clear that he had said nothing secretly which he\r\nhad reason to regret; and that if he sought to shun the discussion\r\nopened by his adversaries, he was influenced by wise forbearance, and\r\nnot at all by any fear of the consequences to himself. A dispassionate\r\nobserver could have seen that behind this moderate, rather deprecatory\r\nletter there was an abundant reserve of controversial material held\r\nfor the moment in check. But his adversaries were not dispassionate;\r\non the contrary they were greatly excited and were honestly convinced\r\nof the perfect goodness of their cause. They were men of the highest\r\ncharacter in public and private life, deservedly of the best repute in\r\nthe community, of unimpeachable integrity in motives and dealings,\r\ninfluential and respected, men whom it was impossible in New England\r\nto treat with neglect or indifference. For this reason it was only the\r\nharder to remain silent beneath their published reproach when a\r\nrefutation was possible. Hating Mr. Adams with an animosity not\r\ndiminished by the lapse of years since his defection from their party,\r\nstrong in a consciousness of their own standing before their fellow\r\ncitizens, the thirteen notables responded with much acrimony to Mr.\r\nAdams's unsatisfactory letter. Thus persistently challenged and    (p. 218)\r\nassailed, at a time when his recent crushing political defeat made\r\nan attack upon him seem a little ungenerous, Mr. Adams at last went\r\ninto the fight in earnest. He had the good fortune to be thoroughly\r\nright, and also to have sufficient evidence to prove and justify at\r\nleast as much as he had ever said. All this evidence he brought\r\ntogether in a vindicatory pamphlet, which, however, by the time he had\r\ncompleted it he decided not to publish. But fortunately he did not\r\ndestroy it, and his grandson, in the exercise of a wise discretion,\r\nhas lately given it to the world. His foes never knew how deeply they\r\nwere indebted to the self-restraint which induced him to keep this\r\nformidable missive harmless in his desk. Full of deep feeling, yet\r\nfree from ebullitions of temper, clear in statement, concise in style,\r\nconclusive in facts, unanswerable in argument, unrelentingly severe in\r\ndealing with opponents, it is as fine a specimen of political\r\ncontroversy as exists in the language. Its historical value cannot be\r\nexaggerated, but apart from this as a mere literary production it is\r\nadmirable. Happy were the thirteen that they one and all went down to\r\ntheir graves complaisantly thinking that they had had the last word in\r\nthe quarrel, little suspecting how great was their obligation to Mr.\r\nAdams for having granted them that privilege. One would think      (p. 219)\r\nthat they might have writhed beneath their moss-grown headstones\r\non the day when his last word at length found public utterance, albeit\r\nthat the controversy had then become one of the dusty tales of\r\nhistory.[8]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8: It is with great reluctance that these\r\n                   comments are made, since some persons may think\r\n                   that they come with ill grace from one whose\r\n                   grandfather was one of the thirteen and was\r\n                   supposed to have drafted one or both of their\r\n                   letters. But in spite of the prejudice naturally\r\n                   growing out of this fact, a thorough study of the\r\n                   whole subject has convinced me that Mr. Adams was\r\n                   unquestionably and completely right, and I have no\r\n                   escape from saying so. His adversaries had the\r\n                   excuse of honesty in political error--an excuse\r\n                   which the greatest and wisest men must often fall\r\n                   back upon in times of hot party warfare.]\r\n\r\nBut this task of writing a demolishing pamphlet against the prominent\r\ngentlemen of the neighborhood to which he was about to return for his\r\ndeclining years could hardly have been a grateful task. The passage\r\nfrom political disaster to social enmities could not but be painful;\r\nand Mr. Adams was probably never more unhappy than at this period of\r\nhis life. The reward which virtue was tendering to him seemed unmixed\r\nbitterness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus at the age of sixty-two years, Mr. Adams found himself that\r\nmelancholy product of the American governmental system--an ex-President.\r\nAt this stage it would seem that the fruit ought to drop from the  (p. 220)\r\nbough, no further process of development being reasonably probable\r\nfor it. Yet Mr. Adams had by no means reached this measure of\r\nripeness; he still enjoyed abundant vigor of mind and body, and to\r\nlapse into dignified decrepitude was not agreeable, indeed was hardly\r\npossible for him. The prospect gave him profound anxiety; he dreaded\r\nidleness, apathy, and decay with a keen terror which perhaps\r\nconstituted a sufficient guaranty against them. Yet what could he do?\r\nIt would be absurd for him now to furbish up the rusty weapons of the\r\nlaw and enter again upon the tedious labor of collecting a clientage.\r\nHis property was barely sufficient to enable him to live respectably,\r\neven according to the simple standard of the time, and could open to\r\nhim no occupation in the way of gratifying unremunerative tastes. In\r\nMarch, 1828, he had been advised to use five thousand dollars in a way\r\nto promote his reëlection. He refused at once, upon principle; but\r\nfurther set forth \"candidly, the state of his affairs:\"--\r\n\r\n     \"All my real estate in Quincy and Boston is mortgaged for the\r\n     payment of my debts; the income of my whole private estate is\r\n     less than $6,000 a year, and I am paying at least two thousand of\r\n     that for interest on my debt. Finally, upon going out of office\r\n     in one year from this time, destitute of all means of         (p. 221)\r\n     acquiring property, it will only be by the sacrifice of that\r\n     which I now possess that I shall be able to support my family.\"\r\n\r\nAt first he plunged desperately into the Latin classics. He had a\r\nstrong taste for such reading, and he made a firm resolve to compel\r\nthis taste now to stand him in good stead in his hour of need. He\r\ncourageously demanded solace from a pursuit which had yielded him\r\npleasure enough in hours of relaxation, but which was altogether\r\ninadequate to fill the huge vacuum now suddenly created in his time\r\nand thoughts. There is much pathos in this spectacle of the old man\r\nsetting himself with ever so feeble a weapon, yet with stern\r\ndetermination, to conquer the cruelty of circumstances. But he knew,\r\nof course, that the Roman authors could only help him for a time, by\r\nway of distraction, in carrying him through a transition period. He\r\nsoon set more cheerfully at work upon a memoir of his father, and had\r\nalso plans for writing a history of the United States. Literature had\r\nalways possessed strong charms for him, and he had cultivated it after\r\nhis usual studious and conscientious fashion. But his style was too\r\noften prolix, sententious, and turgid--faults which marked nearly all\r\nthe writing done in this country in those days. The world has      (p. 222)\r\nprobably not lost much by reason of the non-completion of the\r\ncontemplated volumes. He could have made no other contribution to the\r\nhistory of the country at all approaching in value or interest to the\r\nDiary, of which a most important part was still to be written. For a\r\nbrief time just now this loses its historic character, but makes up\r\nfor the loss by depicting admirably some traits in the mental\r\nconstitution of the diarist. Tales of enchantment, he says, pleased\r\nhis boyhood, but \"the humors of Falstaff hardly affected me at all.\r\nBardolph and Pistol and Nym were personages quite unintelligible to\r\nme; and the lesson of Sir Hugh Evans to the boy Williams was quite too\r\nserious an affair.\" In truth, no man can ever have been more utterly\r\nvoid of a sense of humor or an appreciation of wit than was Mr. Adams.\r\nNot a single instance of an approach to either is to be found\r\nthroughout the twelve volumes of his Diary. Not even in the simple\r\nform of the \"good story\" could he find pleasure, and subtler delicacies\r\nwere wasted on his well-regulated mind as dainty French dishes would\r\nbe on the wholesome palate of a day-laborer. The books which bore the\r\nstamp of well-established approval, the acknowledged classics of the\r\nEnglish, Latin, and French languages he read with a mingled sense of\r\nduty and of pleasure, and evidently with cultivated appreciation,  (p. 223)\r\nthough whether he would have made an original discovery of their\r\nmerits may be doubted. Occasionally he failed to admire even those\r\nvolumes which deserved admiration, and then with characteristic\r\nhonesty he admitted the fact. He tried Paradise Lost ten times before\r\nhe could get through with it, and was nearly thirty years old when he\r\nfirst succeeded in reading it to the end. Thereafter he became very\r\nfond of it, but plainly by an acquired taste. He tried smoking and\r\nMilton, he says, at the same time, in the hope of discovering the\r\n\"recondite charm\" in them which so pleased his father. He was more\r\neasily successful with the tobacco than with the poetry. Many another\r\nhas had the like experience, but the confession is not always so\r\nfrankly forthcoming.\r\n\r\nFate, however, had in store for Mr. Adams labors to which he was\r\nbetter suited than those of literature, and tasks to be performed\r\nwhich the nation could ill afford to exchange for an apotheosis of our\r\nsecond President, or even for a respectable but probably not very\r\nreadable history. The most brilliant and glorious years of his career\r\nwere yet to be lived. He was to earn in his old age a noble fame and\r\ndistinction far transcending any achievement of his youth and middle\r\nage, and was to attain the highest pinnacle of his fame after he   (p. 224)\r\nhad left the greatest office of the Government, and during a period\r\nfor which presumably nothing better had been allotted than that he\r\nshould tranquilly await the summons of death. It is a striking\r\ncircumstance that the fullness of greatness for one who had been\r\nSenator, Minister to England, Secretary of State, and President,\r\nremained to be won in the comparatively humble position of a\r\nRepresentative in Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III                                                        (p. 225)\r\n\r\nIN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn September, 1830, Mr. Adams notes in his Diary a suggestion made to\r\nhim that he might if he wished be elected to the national House of\r\nRepresentatives from the Plymouth district. The gentleman who threw\r\nout this tentative proposition remarked that in his opinion the\r\nacceptance of this position by an ex-President \"instead of degrading\r\nthe individual would elevate the representative character.\" Mr. Adams\r\nreplied, that he \"had in that respect no scruple whatever. No person\r\ncould be degraded by serving the people as a Representative in\r\nCongress. Nor in my opinion would an ex-President of the United States\r\nbe degraded by serving as a selectman of his town, if elected thereto\r\nby the people.\" A few weeks later his election was accomplished by a\r\nflattering vote, the poll showing for him 1817 votes out of 2565, with\r\nonly 373 for the next candidate. He continued thenceforth to represent\r\nthis district until his death, a period of about sixteen years. During\r\nthis time he was occasionally suggested as a candidate for the     (p. 226)\r\ngovernorship of the State, but was always reluctant to stand. The\r\nfeeling between the Freemasons and the anti-Masons ran very high for\r\nseveral years, and once he was prevailed upon to allow his name to be\r\nused by the latter party. The result was that there was no election by\r\nthe people; and as he had been very loath to enter the contest in the\r\nbeginning, he insisted upon withdrawing from before the legislature.\r\nWe have now therefore only to pursue his career in the lower house of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, but of obvious necessity, it is possible to touch only\r\nupon the more salient points of this which was really by far the most\r\nstriking and distinguished portion of his life. To do more than this\r\nwould involve an explanation of the politics of the country and the\r\nmeasures before Congress much more elaborate than would be possible in\r\nthis volume. It will be necessary, therefore, to confine ourselves to\r\ndrawing a picture of him in his character as the great combatant of\r\nSouthern slavery. In the waging of this mighty conflict we shall see\r\nboth his mind and his character developing in strength even in these\r\nyears of his old age, and his traits standing forth in bolder relief\r\nthan ever before. In his place on the floor of the House of\r\nRepresentatives he was destined to appear a more impressive figure\r\nthan in any of the higher positions which he had previously        (p. 227)\r\nfilled. There he was to do his greatest work and to win a peculiar and\r\ndistinctive glory which takes him out of the general throng even of\r\nfamous statesmen, and entitles his name to be remembered with an\r\nespecial reverence. Adequately to sketch his achievements, and so to\r\ndo his memory the honor which it deserves, would require a pen as\r\neloquent as has been wielded by any writer of our language. I can only\r\nattempt a brief and insufficient narrative.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn his conscientious way he was faithful and industrious to a rare\r\ndegree. He was never absent and seldom late; he bore unflinchingly the\r\nburden of severe committee work, and shirked no toil on the plea of\r\nage or infirmity. He attended closely to all the business of the\r\nHouse; carefully formed his opinions on every question; never failed\r\nto vote except for cause; and always had a sufficient reason\r\nindependent of party allegiance to sustain his vote. Living in the age\r\nof oratory, he earned the name of \"the old man eloquent.\" Yet he was\r\nnot an orator in the sense in which Webster, Clay, and Calhoun were\r\norators. He was not a rhetorician; he had neither grace of manner nor\r\na fine presence, neither an imposing delivery, nor even pleasing\r\ntones. On the contrary, he was exceptionally lacking in all these  (p. 228)\r\nqualities. He was short, rotund, and bald; about the time when he\r\nentered Congress, complaints become frequent in his Diary of weak and\r\ninflamed eyes, and soon these organs became so rheumy that the water\r\nwould trickle down his cheeks; a shaking of the hand grew upon him to\r\nsuch an extent that in time he had to use artificial assistance to\r\nsteady it for writing; his voice was high, shrill, liable to break,\r\npiercing enough to make itself heard, but not agreeable. This hardly\r\nseems the picture of an orator; nor was it to any charm of elocution\r\nthat he owed his influence, but rather to the fact that men soon\r\nlearned that what he said was always well worth hearing. When he\r\nentered Congress he had been for much more than a third of a century\r\nzealously gathering knowledge in public affairs, and during his career\r\nin that body every year swelled the already vast accumulation.\r\nMoreover, listeners were always sure to get a bold and an honest\r\nutterance and often pretty keen words from him, and he never spoke to\r\nan inattentive audience or to a thin house. Whether pleased or\r\nincensed by what he said, the Representatives at least always listened\r\nto it. He was by nature a hard fighter, and by the circumstances of\r\nhis course in Congress this quality was stimulated to such a degree\r\nthat parliamentary history does not show his equal as a gladiator. (p. 229)\r\nHis power of invective was extraordinary, and he was untiring and\r\nmerciless in his use of it. Theoretically he disapproved of sarcasm,\r\nbut practically he could not refrain from it. Men winced and cowered\r\nbefore his milder attacks, became sometimes dumb, sometimes furious\r\nwith mad rage before his fiercer assaults. Such struggles evidently\r\ngave him pleasure, and there was scarce a back in Congress that did\r\nnot at one time or another feel the score of his cutting lash; though\r\nit was the Southerners and the Northern allies of Southerners whom\r\nchiefly he singled out for torture. He was irritable and quick to\r\nwrath; he himself constantly speaks of the infirmity of his temper,\r\nand in his many conflicts his principal concern was to keep it in\r\ncontrol. His enemies often referred to it and twitted him with it. Of\r\nalliances he was careless, and friendships he had almost none. But in\r\nthe creation of enmities he was terribly successful. Not so much at\r\nfirst, but increasingly as years went on, a state of ceaseless,\r\nvigilant hostility became his normal condition. From the time when he\r\nfairly entered upon the long struggle against slavery, he enjoyed few\r\npeaceful days in the House. But he seemed to thrive upon the warfare,\r\nand to be never so well pleased as when he was bandying hot words with\r\nslave-holders and the Northern supporters of slave-holders. When   (p. 230)\r\nthe air of the House was thick with crimination and abuse he seemed to\r\nsuck in fresh vigor and spirit from the hate-laden atmosphere. When\r\ninvective fell around him in showers, he screamed back his retaliation\r\nwith untiring rapidity and marvellous dexterity of aim. No odds could\r\nappall him. With his back set firm against a solid moral principle, it\r\nwas his joy to strike out at a multitude of foes. They lost their heads\r\nas well as their tempers, but in the extremest moments of excitement\r\nand anger Mr. Adams's brain seemed to work with machine-like coolness\r\nand accuracy. With flushed face, streaming eyes, animated gesticulation,\r\nand cracking voice, he always retained perfect mastery of all his\r\nintellectual faculties. He thus became a terrible antagonist, whom all\r\nfeared, yet fearing could not refrain from attacking, so bitterly and\r\nincessantly did he choose to exert his wonderful power of\r\nexasperation. Few men could throw an opponent into wild blind fury\r\nwith such speed and certainty as he could; and he does not conceal the\r\nmalicious gratification which such feats brought to him. A leader of\r\nsuch fighting capacity, so courageous, with such a magazine of\r\nexperience and information, and with a character so irreproachable,\r\ncould have won brilliant victories in public life at the head of   (p. 231)\r\neven a small band of devoted followers. But Mr. Adams never had and\r\napparently never wanted followers. Other prominent public men were\r\nbrought not only into collision but into comparison with their\r\ncontemporaries. But Mr. Adams's individuality was so strong that he\r\ncan be compared with no one. It was not an individuality of genius nor\r\nto any remarkable extent of mental qualities; but rather an\r\nindividuality of character. To this fact is probably to be attributed\r\nhis peculiar solitariness. Men touch each other for purposes of\r\nattachment through their characters much more than through their\r\nminds. But few men, even in agreeing with Mr. Adams, felt themselves\r\nin sympathy with him. Occasionally conscience, or invincible logic, or\r\neven policy and self-interest, might compel one or another politician\r\nto stand beside him in debate or in voting; but no current of fellow\r\nfeeling ever passed between such temporary comrades and him. It was\r\nthe cold connection of duty or of business. The first instinct of\r\nnearly every one was opposition towards him; coalition might be forced\r\nby circumstances but never came by volition. For the purpose of\r\nwinning immediate successes this was of course a most unfortunate\r\ncondition of relationships. Yet it had some compensations: it left\r\nsuch influence as Mr. Adams could exert by steadfastness and       (p. 232)\r\nargument entirely unweakened by suspicion of hidden motives or\r\npersonal ends. He had the weight and enjoyed the respect which a\r\nsincerity beyond distrust must always command in the long run. Of this\r\nwe shall see some striking instances.\r\n\r\nOne important limitation, however, belongs to this statement of\r\nsolitariness. It was confined to his position in Congress. Outside of\r\nthe city of Washington great numbers of the people, especially in New\r\nEngland, lent him a hearty support and regarded him with friendship\r\nand admiration. These men had strong convictions and deep feelings,\r\nand their adherence counted for much. Moreover, their numbers steadily\r\nincreased, and Mr. Adams saw that he was the leader in a cause which\r\nengaged the sound sense and the best feeling of the intelligent people\r\nof the country, and which was steadily gaining ground. Without such\r\nencouragement it is doubtful whether even his persistence would have\r\nheld out through so long and extreme a trial. The sense of human\r\nfellowship was needful to him; he could go without it in Congress, but\r\nhe could not have gone without it altogether.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams took his seat in the House as a member of the twenty-second\r\nCongress in December, 1831. He had been elected by the National\r\nRepublican, afterward better known as the Whig party, but one of   (p. 233)\r\nhis first acts was to declare that he would be bound by no partisan\r\nconnection, but would in every matter act independently. This course\r\nhe regarded as a \"duty imposed upon him by his peculiar position,\" in\r\nthat he \"had spent the greatest portion of his life in the service of\r\nthe whole nation and had been honored with their highest trust.\" Many\r\npersons had predicted that he would find himself subjected to\r\nembarrassments and perhaps to humiliations by reason of his apparent\r\ndescent in the scale of political dignities. He notes, however, that\r\nhe encountered no annoyance on this score, but on the contrary he was\r\nrather treated with an especial respect. He was made chairman of the\r\nCommittee on Manufactures, a laborious as well as an important and\r\nhonorable position at all times, and especially so at this juncture\r\nwhen the rebellious mutterings of South Carolina against the\r\nprotective tariff were already to be heard rolling and swelling like\r\nportentous thunder from the fiery Southern regions. He would have\r\npreferred to exchange this post for a place upon the Committee on\r\nForeign Affairs, for whose business he felt more fitted. But he was\r\ntold that in the impending crisis his ability, authority, and prestige\r\nwere all likely to be needed in the place allotted to him to aid in\r\nthe salvation of the country.\r\n\r\nThe nullification chapter of our history cannot here be entered    (p. 234)\r\nupon at length, and Mr. Adams's connection with it must be very\r\nshortly stated. At the first meeting of his committee he remarks: \"A\r\nreduction of the duties upon many of the articles in the tariff was\r\nunderstood by all to be the object to be effected;\" and a little later\r\nhe said that he should be disposed to give such aid as he could to any\r\nplan for this reduction which the Treasury Department should devise.\r\n\"He should certainly not consent to sacrifice the manufacturing\r\ninterest,\" he said, \"but something of concession would be due from\r\nthat interest to appease the discontents of the South.\" He was in a\r\nreasonable frame of mind; but unfortunately other people were rapidly\r\nceasing to be reasonable. When Jackson's message of December 4, 1832,\r\nwas promulgated, showing a disposition to do for South Carolina pretty\r\nmuch all that she demanded, Mr. Adams was bitterly indignant. The\r\nmessage, he said, \"recommends a total change in the policy of the\r\nUnion with reference to the Bank, manufactures, internal improvement,\r\nand the public lands. It goes to dissolve the Union into its original\r\nelements, and is in substance a complete surrender to the nullifiers\r\nof South Carolina.\" When, somewhat later on, the President lost his\r\ntemper and flamed out in his famous proclamation to meet the       (p. 235)\r\nnullification ordinance, he spoke in tones more pleasing to Mr. Adams.\r\nBut the ultimate compromise which disposed of the temporary dissension\r\nwithout permanently settling the fundamental question of the\r\nconstitutional right of nullification was extremely distasteful to\r\nhim. He was utterly opposed to the concessions which were made while\r\nSouth Carolina still remained contumacious. He was for compelling her\r\nto retire altogether from her rebellious position and to repeal her\r\nunconstitutional enactments wholly and unconditionally, before one jot\r\nshould be abated from the obnoxious duties. When the bill for the\r\nmodification of the tariff was under debate, he moved to strike out\r\nall but the enacting clause, and supported his motion in a long\r\nspeech, insisting that no tariff ought to pass until it was known\r\n\"whether there was any measure by which a State could defeat the laws\r\nof the Union.\" In a minority report from his own committee he strongly\r\ncensured the policy of the Administration. He was for meeting,\r\nfighting out, and determining at this crisis the whole doctrine of\r\nstate rights and secession. \"One particle of compromise,\" he said,\r\nwith what truth events have since shown clearly enough, would\r\n\"directly lead to the final and irretrievable dissolution of the\r\nUnion.\" In his usual strong and thorough-going fashion he was for  (p. 236)\r\npersisting in the vigorous and spirited measures, the mere brief\r\ndeclaration of which, though so quickly receded from, won for Jackson\r\na measure of credit greater than he deserved. Jackson was thrown into\r\na great rage by the threats of South Carolina, and replied to them\r\nwith the same prompt wrath with which he had sometimes resented\r\ninsults from individuals. But in his cool inner mind he was in\r\nsympathy with the demands which that State preferred, and though\r\nundoubtedly he would have fought her, had the dispute been forced to\r\nthat pass, yet he was quite willing to make concessions, which were in\r\nfact in consonance with his own views as well as with hers, in order\r\nto avoid that sad conclusion. He was satisfied to have the instant\r\nemergency pass over in a manner rendered superficially creditable to\r\nhimself by his outburst of temper, under cover of which he sacrificed\r\nthe substantial matter of principle without a qualm. He shook his fist\r\nand shouted defiance in the face of the nullifiers, while Mr. Clay\r\nsmuggled a comfortable concession into their pockets. Jackson,\r\nnotwithstanding his belligerent attitude, did all he could to help\r\nClay and was well pleased with the result. Mr. Adams was not. He\r\nwatched the disingenuous game with disgust. It is certain that if he\r\nhad still been in the White House, the matter would have had a     (p. 237)\r\nvery different ending, bloodier, it may be, and more painful, but\r\nmuch more conclusive.\r\n\r\nFor the most part Mr. Adams found himself in opposition to President\r\nJackson's Administration. This was not attributable to any sense of\r\npersonal hostility towards a successful rival, but to an inevitable\r\nantipathy towards the measures, methods, and ways adopted by the\r\nGeneral so unfortunately transferred to civil life. Few intelligent\r\npersons, and none having the statesman habit of mind, befriended the\r\nreckless, violent, eminently unstatesmanlike President. His ultimate\r\nweakness in the nullification matter, his opposition to internal\r\nimprovements, his policy of sacrificing the public lands to individual\r\nspeculators, his warfare against the Bank of the United States\r\nconducted by methods the most unjustifiable, the transaction of the\r\nremoval of the deposits so disreputable and injurious in all its\r\ndetails, the importation of Mrs. Eaton's visiting-list into the\r\npolitics and government of the country, the dismissal of the oldest\r\nand best public servants as a part of the nefarious system of using\r\npublic offices as rewards for political aid and personal adherence,\r\nthe formation from base ingredients of the ignoble \"Kitchen\r\nCabinet,\"--all these doings, together with much more of the like   (p. 238)\r\nsort, constituted a career which could only seem blundering,\r\nundignified, and dishonorable in the eyes of a man like Mr. Adams, who\r\nregarded statesmanship with the reverence due to the noblest of human\r\ncallings.\r\n\r\nRight as Mr. Adams was generally in his opposition to Jackson, yet\r\nonce he deserves credit for the contrary course. This was in the\r\nmatter of our relations with France. The treaty of 1831 secured to\r\nthis country an indemnity of $5,000,000, which, however, it had never\r\nbeen possible to collect. This procrastination raised Jackson's ever\r\nready ire, and casting to the winds any further dunning, he resolved\r\neither to have the money or to fight for it. He sent a message to\r\nCongress, recommending that if France should not promptly settle the\r\naccount, letters of marque and reprisal against her commerce should be\r\nissued. He ordered Edward Livingston, minister at Paris, to demand his\r\npassports and cross over to London. These eminently proper and\r\nultimately effectual measures alarmed the large party of the timid;\r\nand the General found himself in danger of extensive desertions even\r\non the part of his usual supporters. But as once before in a season of\r\nhis dire extremity his courage and vigor had brought the potent aid of\r\nMr. Adams to his side, so now again he came under a heavy debt of  (p. 239)\r\ngratitude to the same champion. Mr. Adams stood by him with generous\r\ngallantry, and by a telling speech in the House probably saved him\r\nfrom serious humiliation and even disaster. The President's style of\r\ndealing had roused Mr. Adams's spirit, and he spoke with a fire and\r\nvehemence which accomplished the unusual feat of changing the\r\npredisposed minds of men too familiar with speech-making to be often\r\nmuch influenced by it in the practical matter of voting. He thought at\r\nthe time that the success of this speech, brilliant as it appeared,\r\nwas not unlikely to result in his political ruin. Jackson would\r\nbefriend and reward his thorough-going partisans at any cost to his\r\nown conscience or the public welfare; but the exceptional aid,\r\ntendered not from a sense of personal fealty to himself, but simply\r\nfrom the motive of aiding the right cause happening in the especial\r\ninstance to have been espoused by him, never won from him any token of\r\nregard. In November, 1837, Mr. Adams, speaking of his personal\r\nrelations with the President, said:--\r\n\r\n     \"Though I had served him more than any other living man ever did,\r\n     and though I supported his Administration at the hazard of my own\r\n     political destruction, and effected for him at a moment when his\r\n     own friends were deserting him what no other member of Congress\r\n     ever accomplished for him--an unanimous vote of the House of  (p. 240)\r\n     Representatives to support him in his quarrel with France; though\r\n     I supported him in other very critical periods of his Administration,\r\n     my return from him was insult, indignity, and slander.\"\r\n\r\nAntipathy had at last become the definitive condition of these two\r\nmen--antipathy both political and personal. At one time a singular\r\neffort to reconcile them--probably though not certainly undertaken\r\nwith the knowledge of Jackson--was made by Richard M. Johnson. This\r\noccurred shortly before the inauguration of the war conducted by the\r\nPresident against the Bank of the United States; and judging by the\r\nrest of Jackson's behavior at this period, there was probably at least\r\nas much of calculation in his motives, if in fact he was cognizant of\r\nJohnson's approaches, as there was of any real desire to reëstablish\r\nthe bygone relation of honorable friendship. To the advances thus made\r\nMr. Adams replied a little coldly, not quite repellently, that Jackson,\r\nhaving been responsible for the suspension of personal intercourse,\r\nmust now be undisguisedly the active party in renewing it. At the same\r\ntime he professed himself \"willing to receive in a spirit of\r\nconciliation any advance which in that spirit General Jackson might\r\nmake.\" But nothing came of this intrinsically hopeless attempt. On\r\nthe contrary the two drew rapidly and more widely apart, and       (p. 241)\r\nentertained concerning each other opinions which grew steadily more\r\nunfavorable, and upon Adams's part more contemptuous, as time went on.\r\n\r\nFifteen months later General Jackson made his visit to Boston, and it\r\nwas proposed that Harvard College should confer upon him the degree of\r\nDoctor of Laws. The absurdity of the act, considered simply in itself,\r\nwas admitted by all. But the argument in its favor was based upon the\r\nestablished usage of the College as towards all other Presidents, so\r\nthat its omission in this case might seem a personal slight. Mr. Adams,\r\nbeing at the time a member of the Board of Overseers, strongly opposed\r\nthe proposition, but of course in vain. All that he could do was, for\r\nhis own individual part, to refuse to be present at the conferring of\r\nthe degree, giving as the minor reason for his absence, that he could\r\nhold no friendly intercourse with the President, but for the major\r\nreason that \"independent of that, as myself an affectionate child of\r\nour Alma Mater, I would not be present to witness her disgrace in\r\nconferring her highest literary honors upon a barbarian who could not\r\nwrite a sentence of grammar and hardly could spell his own name.\" \"A\r\nDoctorate of Laws,\" he said, \"for which an apology was necessary, was\r\na cheap honor and ... a sycophantic compliment.\" After the deed    (p. 242)\r\nwas done, he used to amuse himself by speaking of \"Doctor Andrew\r\nJackson.\" This same eastern tour of Jackson's called forth many other\r\nexpressions of bitter sarcasm from Adams. The President was ill and\r\nunable to carry out the programme of entertainment and exhibition\r\nprepared for him: whereupon Mr. Adams remarks:--\r\n\r\n     \"I believe much of his debility is politic.... He is one of our\r\n     tribe of great men who turn disease to commodity, like John\r\n     Randolph, who for forty years was always dying. Jackson, ever\r\n     since he became a mark of public attention, has been doing the\r\n     same thing.... He is now alternately giving out his chronic\r\n     diarrhoea and making Warren bleed him for a pleurisy, and\r\n     posting to Cambridge for a doctorate of laws; mounting the\r\n     monument of Bunker's Hill to hear a fulsome address and receive\r\n     two cannon balls from Edward Everett,\" etc. \"Four fifths of his\r\n     sickness is trickery, and the other fifth mere fatigue.\"\r\n\r\nThis sounds, it must be confessed, a trifle rancorous; but Adams had\r\ngreat excuse for nourishing rancor towards Jackson.\r\n\r\nIt is time, however, to return to the House of Representatives. It was\r\nnot by bearing his share in the ordinary work of that body, important\r\nor exciting as that might at one time or another happen to be, that\r\nMr. Adams was to win in Congress that reputation which has been    (p. 243)\r\nalready described as far overshadowing all his previous career. A\r\nspecial task and a peculiar mission were before him. It was a part of\r\nhis destiny to become the champion of the anti-slavery cause in the\r\nnational legislature. Almost the first thing which he did after he had\r\ntaken his seat in Congress was to present \"fifteen petitions signed\r\nnumerously by citizens of Pennsylvania, praying for the abolition of\r\nslavery and the slave-trade in the District of Columbia.\" He simply\r\nmoved their reference to the Committee on the District of Columbia,\r\ndeclaring that he should not support that part of the petition which\r\nprayed for abolition in the District. The time had not yet come when\r\nthe South felt much anxiety at such manifestations, and these first\r\nstones were dropped into the pool without stirring a ripple on the\r\nsurface. For about four years more we hear little in the Diary\r\nconcerning slavery. It was not until 1835, when the annexation of\r\nTexas began to be mooted, that the North fairly took the alarm, and\r\nthe irrepressible conflict began to develop. Then at once we find Mr.\r\nAdams at the front. That he had always cherished an abhorrence of\r\nslavery and a bitter antipathy to slave-holders as a class is\r\nsufficiently indicated by many chance remarks scattered through his\r\nDiary from early years. Now that a great question, vitally         (p. 244)\r\naffecting the slave power, divided the country into parties and\r\ninaugurated the struggle which never again slept until it was settled\r\nforever by the result of the civil war, Mr. Adams at once assumed the\r\nfunction of leader. His position should be clearly understood; for in\r\nthe vast labor which lay before the abolition party different tasks\r\nfell to different men. Mr. Adams assumed to be neither an agitator nor\r\na reformer; by necessity of character, training, fitness, and official\r\nposition, he was a legislator and statesman. The task which accident\r\nor destiny allotted to him was neither to preach among the people a\r\ncrusade against slavery, nor to devise and keep in action the thousand\r\nresources which busy men throughout the country were constantly\r\nmultiplying for the purpose of spreading and increasing a popular\r\nhostility towards the great \"institution.\" Every great cause has need\r\nof its fanatics, its vanguard to keep far in advance of what is for\r\nthe time reasonable and possible; it has not less need of the wiser\r\nand cooler heads to discipline and control the great mass which is set\r\nin motion by the reckless forerunners, to see to the accomplishment of\r\nthat which the present circumstances and development of the movement\r\nallow to be accomplished. It fell to Mr. Adams to direct the       (p. 245)\r\nassault against the outworks which were then vulnerable, and to see\r\nthat the force then possessed by the movement was put to such uses as\r\nwould insure definite results instead of being wasted in endeavors\r\nwhich as yet were impossible of achievement. Drawing his duty from his\r\nsituation and surroundings, he left to others, to younger men and more\r\nrhetorical natures, outside the walls of Congress, the business of\r\nfiring the people and stirring popular opinion and sympathy. He was\r\nset to do that portion of the work of abolition which was to be done\r\nin Congress, to encounter the mighty efforts which were made to stifle\r\nthe great humanitarian cry in the halls of the national legislature.\r\nThis was quite as much as one man was equal to; in fact, it is certain\r\nthat no one then in public life except Mr. Adams could have done it\r\neffectually. So obvious is this that one cannot help wondering what\r\nwould have befallen the cause, had he not been just where he was to\r\nforward it in just the way that he did. It is only another among the\r\nmany instances of the need surely finding the man. His qualifications\r\nwere unique; his ability, his knowledge, his prestige and authority,\r\nhis high personal character, his persistence and courage, his\r\ncombativeness stimulated by an acrimonious temper but checked by a\r\nsound judgment, his merciless power of invective, his independence (p. 246)\r\nand carelessness of applause or vilification, friendship or enmity,\r\nconstituted him an opponent fully equal to the enormous odds which the\r\nslave-holding interest arrayed against him. A like moral and mental\r\nfitness was to be found in no one else. Numbers could not overawe him,\r\nnor loneliness dispirit him. He was probably the most formidable\r\nfighter in debate of whom parliamentary records preserve the memory.\r\nThe hostility which he encountered beggars description; the English\r\nlanguage was deficient in adequate words of virulence and contempt to\r\nexpress the feelings which were entertained towards him. At home he\r\nhad not the countenance of that class in society to which he naturally\r\nbelonged. A second time he found the chief part of the gentlemen of\r\nBoston and its vicinity, the leading lawyers, the rich merchants, the\r\nsuccessful manufacturers, not only opposed to him, but entertaining\r\ntowards him sentiments of personal dislike and even vindictiveness.\r\nThis stratum of the community, having a natural distaste for disquieting\r\nagitation and influenced by class feeling,--the gentlemen of the North\r\nsympathizing with the \"aristocracy\" of the South,--could not make\r\ncommon cause with anti-slavery people. Fortunately, however, Mr. Adams\r\nwas returned by a country district where the old Puritan instincts (p. 247)\r\nwere still strong. The intelligence and free spirit of New England\r\nwere at his back, and were fairly represented by him; in spite of\r\nhigh-bred disfavor they carried him gallantly through the long\r\nstruggle. The people of the Plymouth district sent him back to the\r\nHouse every two years from the time of his first election to the year\r\nof his death, and the disgust of the gentlemen of Boston was after all\r\nof trifling consequence to him and of no serious influence upon the\r\ncourse of history. The old New England instinct was in him as it was\r\nin the mass of the people; that instinct made him the real exponent of\r\nNew England thought, belief, and feeling, and that same instinct made\r\nthe great body of voters stand by him with unswerving constancy. When\r\nhis fellow Representatives, almost to a man, deserted him, he was\r\nsustained by many a token of sympathy and admiration coming from among\r\nthe people at large. Time and the history of the United States have\r\nbeen his potent vindicators. The conservative, conscienceless\r\nrespectability of wealth was, as is usually the case with it in the\r\nannals of the Anglo-Saxon race, quite in the wrong and predestined to\r\nwell-merited defeat. It adds to the honor due to Mr. Adams that his\r\nsense of right was true enough, and that his vision was clear enough,\r\nto lead him out of that strong thraldom which class feelings,      (p. 248)\r\ntraditions, and comradeship are wont to exercise.\r\n\r\nBut it is time to resume the narrative and to let Mr. Adams's acts--of\r\nwhich after all it is possible to give only the briefest sketch,\r\nselecting a few of the more striking incidents--tell the tale of his\r\nCongressional life.\r\n\r\nOn February 14, 1835, Mr. Adams again presented two petitions for the\r\nabolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, but without giving\r\nrise to much excitement. The fusillade was, however, getting too thick\r\nand fast to be endured longer with indifference by the impatient\r\nSoutherners. At the next session of Congress they concluded to try to\r\nstop it, and their ingenious scheme was to make Congress shot-proof,\r\nso to speak, against such missiles. On January 4, 1836, Mr. Adams\r\npresented an abolition petition couched in the usual form, and moved\r\nthat it be laid on the table, as others like it had lately been. But\r\nin a moment Mr. Glascock, of Georgia, moved that the petition be not\r\nreceived. Debate sprang up on a point of order, and two days later,\r\nbefore the question of reception was determined, a resolution was\r\noffered by Mr. Jarvis, of Maine, declaring that the House would not\r\nentertain any petitions for the abolition of slavery in the District\r\nof Columbia. This resolution was supported on the ground that      (p. 249)\r\nCongress had no constitutional power in the premises. Some days\r\nlater, January 18, 1836, before any final action had been reached upon\r\nthis proposition, Mr. Adams presented some more abolition petitions,\r\none of them signed by \"one hundred and forty-eight ladies, citizens of\r\nthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts; for, I said, I had not yet brought\r\nmyself to doubt whether females were citizens.\" The usual motion not\r\nto receive was made, and then a new device was resorted to in the\r\nshape of a motion that the motion not to receive be laid on the table.\r\n\r\nOn February 8, 1836, this novel scheme for shutting off petitions\r\nagainst slavery immediately upon their presentation was referred to a\r\nselect committee of which Mr. Pinckney was chairman. On May 18 this\r\ncommittee reported in substance: 1. That Congress had no power to\r\ninterfere with slavery in any State; 2. That Congress ought not to\r\ninterfere with slavery in the District of Columbia; 3. That whereas\r\nthe agitation of the subject was disquieting and objectionable, \"all\r\npetitions, memorials, resolutions or papers, relating in any way or to\r\nany extent whatsoever to the subject of slavery or the abolition of\r\nslavery, shall, without being either printed or referred, be laid upon\r\nthe table, and that no further action whatever shall be had        (p. 250)\r\nthereon.\" When it came to taking a vote upon this report a division of\r\nthe question was called for, and the yeas and nays were ordered. The\r\nfirst resolution was then read, whereupon Mr. Adams at once rose and\r\npledged himself, if the House would allow him five minutes' time, to\r\nprove it to be false. But cries of \"order\" resounded; he was compelled\r\nto take his seat and the resolution was adopted by 182 to 9. Upon the\r\nsecond resolution he asked to be excused from voting, and his name was\r\npassed in the call. The third resolution with its preamble was then\r\nread, and Mr. Adams, so soon as his name was called, rose and said: \"I\r\nhold the resolution to be a direct violation of the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, the rules of this House, and the rights of my\r\nconstituents.\" He was interrupted by shrieks of \"order\" resounding on\r\nevery side; but he only spoke the louder and obstinately finished his\r\nsentence before resuming his seat. The resolution was of course agreed\r\nto, the vote standing 117 to 68. Such was the beginning of the famous\r\n\"gag\" which became and long remained--afterward in a worse shape--a\r\nstanding rule of the House. Regularly in each new Congress when the\r\nadoption of rules came up, Mr. Adams moved to rescind the \"gag;\" but\r\nfor many years his motions continued to be voted down, as a        (p. 251)\r\nmatter of course. Its imposition was clearly a mistake on the part of\r\nthe slave-holding party; free debate would almost surely have hurt\r\nthem less than this interference with the freedom of petition. They\r\nhad assumed an untenable position. Henceforth, as the persistent\r\nadvocate of the right of petition, Mr. Adams had a support among the\r\npeople at large vastly greater than he could have enjoyed as the\r\nopponent of slavery. As his adversaries had shaped the issue he was\r\npredestined to victory in a free country.\r\n\r\nA similar scene was enacted on December 21 and 22, 1837. A \"gag\" or\r\n\"speech-smothering\" resolution being then again before the House, Mr.\r\nAdams, when his name was called in the taking of the vote, cried out\r\n\"amidst a perfect war-whoop of 'order:' 'I hold the resolution to be a\r\nviolation of the Constitution, of the right of petition of my\r\nconstituents and of the people of the United States, and of my right\r\nto freedom of speech as a member of this House.'\" Afterward, in\r\nreading over the names of members who had voted, the clerk omitted\r\nthat of Mr. Adams, this utterance of his not having constituted a\r\nvote. Mr. Adams called attention to the omission. The clerk, by\r\ndirection of the Speaker, thereupon called his name. His only reply\r\nwas by a motion that his answer as already made should be entered  (p. 252)\r\non the Journal. The Speaker said that this motion was not in order.\r\nMr. Adams, resolute to get upon the record, requested that his motion\r\nwith the Speaker's decision that it was not in order might be entered\r\non the Journal. The next day, finding that this entry had not been\r\nmade in proper shape, he brought up the matter again. One of his\r\nopponents made a false step, and Mr. Adams \"bantered him\" upon it\r\nuntil the other was provoked into saying that, \"if the question ever\r\ncame to the issue of war, the Southern people would march into New\r\nEngland and conquer it.\" Mr. Adams replied that no doubt they would if\r\nthey could; that he entered his resolution upon the Journal because he\r\nwas resolved that his opponent's \"name should go down to posterity\r\ndamned to everlasting fame.\" No one ever gained much in a war of words\r\nwith this ever-ready and merciless tongue.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams, having soon become known to all the nation as the\r\nindomitable presenter of anti-slavery petitions, quickly found that\r\ngreat numbers of people were ready to keep him busy in this trying\r\ntask. For a long while it was almost as much as he could accomplish to\r\nreceive, sort, schedule, and present the infinite number of petitions\r\nand memorials which came to him praying for the abolition of slavery\r\nand of the slave-trade in the District of Columbia, and opposing   (p. 253)\r\nthe annexation of Texas. It was an occupation not altogether devoid\r\neven of physical danger, and calling for an amount of moral courage\r\ngreater than it is now easy to appreciate. It is the incipient stage\r\nof such a conflict that tests the mettle of the little band of\r\ninnovators. When it grows into a great party question much less\r\ncourage is demanded. The mere presentation of an odious petition may\r\nseem in itself to be a simple task; but to find himself in a constant\r\nstate of antagonism to a powerful, active, and vindictive majority in\r\na debating body, constituted of such material as then made up the\r\nHouse of Representatives, wore hardly even upon the iron temper and\r\ninflexible disposition of Mr. Adams. \"The most insignificant error of\r\nconduct in me at this time,\" he writes in April, 1837, \"would be my\r\nirredeemable ruin in this world; and both the ruling political parties\r\nare watching with intense anxiety for some overt act by me to set the\r\nwhole pack of their hireling presses upon me.\" But amid the host of\r\nfoes, and aware that he could count upon the aid of scarcely a single\r\nhearty and daring friend, he labored only the more earnestly. The\r\nsevere pressure against him begat only the more severe counter\r\npressure upon his part.\r\n\r\nBesides these natural and legitimate difficulties, Mr. Adams was   (p. 254)\r\nfurther in the embarrassing position of one who has to fear as much\r\nfrom the imprudence of allies as from open hostility of antagonists,\r\nand he was often compelled to guard against a peculiar risk coming\r\nfrom his very coadjutors in the great cause. The extremists who had\r\ncast aside all regard for what was practicable, and who utterly\r\nscorned to consider the feasibility or the consequences of measures\r\nwhich seemed to them to be correct as abstract propositions of\r\nmorality, were constantly urging him to action which would only have\r\ndestroyed him forever in political life, would have stripped him of\r\nhis influence, exiled him from that position in Congress where he\r\ncould render the most efficient service that was in him, and left him\r\nnaked of all usefulness and utterly helpless to continue that\r\nessential portion of the labor which could be conducted by no one\r\nelse. \"The abolitionists generally,\" he said, \"are constantly urging\r\nme to indiscreet movements, which would ruin me, and weaken and not\r\nstrengthen their cause.\" His family, on the other hand, sought to\r\nrestrain him from all connection with these dangerous partisans.\r\n\"Between these adverse impulses,\" he writes, \"my mind is agitated\r\nalmost to distraction.... I walk on the edge of a precipice almost\r\nevery step that I take.\" In the midst of all this anxiety,         (p. 255)\r\nhowever, he was fortunately supported by the strong commendation of\r\nhis constituents which they once loyally declared by formal and\r\nunanimous votes in a convention summoned for the express purpose of\r\nmanifesting their support. His feelings appear by an entry in his\r\nDiary in October, 1837:--\r\n\r\n     \"I have gone [he said] as far upon this article, the abolition of\r\n     slavery, as the public opinion of the free portion of the Union\r\n     will bear, and so far that scarcely a slave-holding member of the\r\n     House dares to vote with me upon any question. I have as yet been\r\n     thoroughly sustained by my own State, but one step further and I\r\n     hazard my own standing and influence there, my own final\r\n     overthrow, and the cause of liberty itself for an indefinite\r\n     time, certainly for more than my remnant of life. Were there in\r\n     the House one member capable of taking the lead in this cause of\r\n     universal emancipation, which is moving onward in the world and\r\n     in this country, I would withdraw from the contest which will\r\n     rage with increasing fury as it draws to its crisis, but for the\r\n     management of which my age, infirmities, and approaching end\r\n     totally disqualify me. There is no such man in the House.\"\r\n\r\nSeptember 15, 1837, he says: \"I have been for some time occupied day\r\nand night, when at home, in assorting and recording the petitions and\r\nremonstrances against the annexation of Texas, and other           (p. 256)\r\nanti-slavery petitions, which flow upon me in torrents.\" The next day\r\nhe presented the singular petition of one Sherlock S. Gregory, who had\r\nconceived the eccentric notion of asking Congress to declare him \"an\r\nalien or stranger in the land so long as slavery exists and the wrongs\r\nof the Indians are unrequited and unrepented of.\" September 28 he\r\npresented a batch of his usual petitions, and also asked leave to\r\noffer a resolution calling for a report concerning the coasting trade\r\nin slaves. \"There was what Napoleon would have called a superb NO!\r\nreturned to my request from the servile side of the House.\" The next\r\nday he presented fifty-one more like documents, and notes having\r\npreviously presented one hundred and fifty more.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1837, still at this same work, he made a hard but\r\nfruitless effort to have the Texan remonstrances and petitions sent to\r\na select committee instead of to that on foreign affairs which was\r\nconstituted in the Southern interest. On December 29 he \"presented\r\nseveral bundles of abolition and anti-slavery petitions,\" and said\r\nthat, having declared his opinion that the gag-rule was unconstitutional,\r\nnull, and void, he should \"submit to it only as to physical force.\"\r\nJanuary 3, 1838, he presented \"about a hundred petitions,          (p. 257)\r\nmemorials, and remonstrances,--all laid on the table.\" January 15 he\r\npresented fifty more. January 28 he received thirty-one petitions, and\r\nspent that day and the next in assorting and filing these and others\r\nwhich he previously had, amounting in all to one hundred and twenty.\r\nFebruary 14, in the same year, was a field-day in the petition campaign:\r\nhe presented then no less than three hundred and fifty petitions, all\r\nbut three or four of which bore more or less directly upon the slavery\r\nquestion. Among these petitions was one\r\n\r\n     \"praying that Congress would take measures to protect citizens\r\n     from the North going to the South from danger to their lives.\r\n     When the motion to lay that on the table was made, I said that,\r\n     'In another part of the Capitol it had been threatened that if a\r\n     Northern abolitionist should go to North Carolina, and utter a\r\n     principle of the Declaration of Independence'--Here a loud cry of\r\n     'order! order!' burst forth, in which the Speaker yelled the\r\n     loudest. I waited till it subsided, and then resumed, 'that if\r\n     they could catch him they would hang him!' I said this so as to\r\n     be distinctly heard throughout the hall, the renewed deafening\r\n     shout of 'order! order!' notwithstanding. The Speaker then said,\r\n     'The gentleman from Massachusetts will take his seat;' which I\r\n     did and immediately rose again and presented another petition. He\r\n     did not dare tell me that I could not proceed without         (p. 258)\r\n     permission of the House, and I proceeded. The threat to hang\r\n     Northern abolitionists was uttered by Preston of the Senate\r\n     within the last fortnight.\"\r\n\r\nOn March 12, of the same year, he presented ninety-six petitions,\r\nnearly all of an anti-slavery character, one of them for \"expunging\r\nthe Declaration of Independence from the Journals.\"\r\n\r\nOn December 14, 1838, Mr. Wise, of Virginia, objected to the reception\r\nof certain anti-slavery petitions. The Speaker ruled his objection out\r\nof order, and from this ruling Wise appealed. The question on the\r\nappeal was taken by yeas and nays. When Mr. Adams's name was called,\r\nhe relates:--\r\n\r\n     \"I rose and said, 'Mr. Speaker, considering all the resolutions\r\n     introduced by the gentleman from New Hampshire as'--The Speaker\r\n     roared out, 'The gentleman from Massachusetts must answer Aye or\r\n     No, and nothing else. Order!' With a reinforced voice--'I refuse\r\n     to answer, because I consider all the proceedings of the House as\r\n     unconstitutional'--While in a firm and swelling voice I pronounced\r\n     distinctly these words, the Speaker and about two thirds of the\r\n     House cried, 'order! order! order!' till it became a perfect\r\n     yell. I paused a moment for it to cease and then said, 'a direct\r\n     violation of the Constitution of the United States.' While\r\n     speaking these words with loud, distinct, and slow            (p. 259)\r\n     articulation, the bawl of 'order! order!' resounded again from\r\n     two thirds of the House. The Speaker, with agonizing lungs,\r\n     screamed, 'I call upon the House to support me in the execution\r\n     of my duty!' I then coolly resumed my seat. Waddy Thompson, of\r\n     South Carolina, advancing into one of the aisles with a sarcastic\r\n     smile and silvery tone of voice, said, 'What aid from the House\r\n     would the Speaker desire?' The Speaker snarled back, 'The\r\n     gentleman from South Carolina is out of order!' and a peal of\r\n     laughter burst forth from all sides of the House.\"\r\n\r\nSo that little skirmish ended, much more cheerfully than was often the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 1838, he presented fifty anti-slavery petitions, among\r\nwhich were three praying for the recognition of the Republic of Hayti.\r\nPetitions of this latter kind he strenuously insisted should be\r\nreferred to a select committee, or else to the Committee on Foreign\r\nAffairs, accompanied in the latter case with explicit instructions\r\nthat a report thereon should be brought in. He audaciously stated that\r\nhe asked for these instructions because so many petitions of a like\r\ntenor had been sent to the Foreign Affairs Committee, and had found it\r\na limbo from which they never again emerged, and the chairman had said\r\nthat this would continue to be the case. The chairman, sitting two\r\nrows behind Mr. Adams, said, \"that insinuation should not be       (p. 260)\r\nmade against a gentleman!\" \"I shall make,\" retorted Mr. Adams, \"what\r\ninsinuation I please. This is not an insinuation, but a direct,\r\npositive assertion.\"\r\n\r\nJanuary 7, 1839, he cheerfully records that he presented ninety-five\r\npetitions, bearing \"directly or indirectly upon the slavery topics,\"\r\nand some of them very exasperating in their language. March 30, 1840,\r\nhe handed in no less than five hundred and eleven petitions, many of\r\nwhich were not receivable under the \"gag\" rule adopted on January 28\r\nof that year, which had actually gone the length of refusing so much\r\nas a reception to abolition petitions. April 13, 1840, he presented a\r\npetition for the repeal of the laws in the District of Columbia, which\r\nauthorized the whipping of women. Besides this he had a multitude of\r\nothers, and he only got through the presentation of them \"just as the\r\nmorning hour expired.\" On January 21, 1841, he found much amusement in\r\npuzzling his Southern adversaries by presenting some petitions in\r\nwhich, besides the usual anti-slavery prayers, there was a prayer to\r\nrefuse to admit to the Union any new State whose constitution should\r\ntolerate slavery. The Speaker said that only the latter prayer could\r\nbe _received_ under the \"gag\" rule. Connor, of North Carolina,     (p. 261)\r\nmoved to lay on the table so much of the petition as could be\r\nreceived. Mr. Adams tauntingly suggested that in order to do this it\r\nwould be necessary to mutilate the document by cutting it into two\r\npieces; whereat there was great wrath and confusion, \"the House got\r\ninto a snarl, the Speaker knew not what to do.\" The Southerners raved\r\nand fumed for a while, and finally resorted to their usual expedient,\r\nand dropped altogether a matter which so sorely burned their fingers.\r\n\r\nA fact, very striking in view of the subsequent course of events,\r\nconcerning Mr. Adams's relation with the slavery question, seems\r\nhitherto to have escaped the attention of those who have dealt with\r\nhis career. It may as well find a place here as elsewhere in a\r\nnarrative which it is difficult to make strictly chronological.\r\nApparently he was the first to declare the doctrine, that the\r\nabolition of slavery could be lawfully accomplished by the exercise of\r\nthe war powers of the Government. The earliest expression of this\r\nprinciple is found in a speech made by him in May, 1836, concerning\r\nthe distribution of rations to fugitives from Indian hostilities in\r\nAlabama and Georgia. He then said:--\r\n\r\n     \"From the instant that your slave-holding States become the\r\n     theatre of war, civil, servile, or foreign, from that instant (p. 262)\r\n     the war powers of the Constitution extend to interference with\r\n     the institution of slavery in every way in which it can be\r\n     interfered with, from a claim of indemnity for slaves taken or\r\n     destroyed, to a cession of the State burdened with slavery to a\r\n     foreign power.\"\r\n\r\nIn June, 1841, he made a speech of which no report exists, but the\r\ncontents of which may be in part learned from the replies and\r\nreferences to it which are on record. Therein he appears to have\r\ndeclared that slavery could be abolished in the exercise of the\r\ntreaty-making power, having reference doubtless to a treaty concluding\r\na war.\r\n\r\nThese views were of course mere abstract expressions of opinion as to\r\nthe constitutionality of measures the real occurrence of which was\r\nanticipated by nobody. But, as the first suggestions of a doctrine in\r\nitself most obnoxious to the Southern theory and fundamentally\r\ndestructive of the great Southern \"institution\" under perfectly\r\npossible circumstances, this enunciation by Mr. Adams gave rise to\r\nmuch indignation. Instead of allowing the imperfectly formulated\r\nprinciple to lose its danger in oblivion, the Southerners assailed it\r\nwith vehemence. They taunted Mr. Adams with the opinion, as if merely\r\nto say that he held it was to damn him to everlasting infamy. The only\r\nresult was that they induced him to consider the matter more       (p. 263)\r\nfully, and to express his belief more deliberately. In January, 1842,\r\nMr. Wise attacked him upon this ground, and a month later Marshall\r\nfollowed in the same strain. These assaults were perhaps the direct\r\nincentive to what was said soon after by Mr. Adams, on April 14, 1842,\r\nin a speech concerning war with England and with Mexico, of which\r\nthere was then some talk. Giddings, among other resolutions, had\r\nintroduced one to the effect that the slave States had the exclusive\r\nright to be consulted on the subject of slavery. Mr. Adams said that\r\nhe could not give his assent to this. One of the laws of war, he said,\r\nis\r\n\r\n     \"that when a country is invaded, and two hostile armies are set\r\n     in martial array, the commanders of both armies have power to\r\n     emancipate all the slaves in the invaded territory.\"\r\n\r\nHe cited some precedents from South American history, and continued:--\r\n\r\n     \"Whether the war be servile, civil, or foreign, I lay this down\r\n     as the law of nations. I say that the military authority takes\r\n     for the time the place of all municipal institutions, slavery\r\n     among the rest. Under that state of things, so far from its being\r\n     true that the States where slavery exists have the exclusive\r\n     management of the subject, not only the President of the United\r\n     States but the commander of the army has power to order       (p. 264)\r\n     the universal emancipation of the slaves.\"\r\n\r\nThis declaration of constitutional doctrine was made with much\r\npositiveness and emphasis. There for many years the matter rested. The\r\nprinciple had been clearly asserted by Mr. Adams, angrily repudiated\r\nby the South, and in the absence of the occasion of war there was\r\nnothing more to be done in the matter. But when the exigency at last\r\ncame, and the government of the United States was brought face to face\r\nwith by far the gravest constitutional problem presented by the great\r\nrebellion, then no other solution presented itself save that which had\r\nbeen suggested twenty years earlier in the days of peace by Mr. Adams.\r\nIt was in pursuance of the doctrine to which he thus gave the first\r\nutterance that slavery was forever abolished in the United States.\r\nExtracts from the last-quoted speech long stood as the motto of the\r\n\"Liberator;\" and at the time of the Emancipation Proclamation Mr.\r\nAdams was regarded as the chief and sufficient authority for an act so\r\nmomentous in its effect, so infinitely useful in a matter of national\r\nextremity. But it was evidently a theory which had taken strong hold\r\nupon him. Besides the foregoing speeches there is an explicit\r\nstatement of it in a letter which he wrote from Washington April 4,\r\n1836, to Hon. Solomon Lincoln, of Hingham, a friend and            (p. 265)\r\nconstituent. After touching upon other topics he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The new pretensions of the slave representation in Congress of a\r\n     right to refuse to receive petitions, and that Congress have no\r\n     constitutional power to abolish slavery or the slave-trade in the\r\n     District of Columbia, forced upon me so much of the discussion as\r\n     I did take upon me, but in which you are well aware I did not and\r\n     could not speak a tenth part of my mind. I did not, for example,\r\n     start the question whether by the law of God and of nature man\r\n     can hold _property_, HEREDITARY property, in man. I did not start\r\n     the question whether in the event of a servile insurrection and\r\n     war, Congress would not have complete unlimited control over the\r\n     whole subject of slavery, even to the emancipation of all the\r\n     slaves in the State where such insurrection should break out, and\r\n     for the suppression of which the freemen of Plymouth and Norfolk\r\n     counties, Massachusetts, should be called by Acts of Congress to\r\n     pour out their treasures and to shed their blood. Had I spoken my\r\n     mind on these two points, the sturdiest of the abolitionists\r\n     would have disavowed the sentiments of their champion.\"\r\n\r\nThe projected annexation of Texas, which became a battle-ground\r\nwhereon the tide of conflict swayed so long and so fiercely to and\r\nfro, profoundly stirred Mr. Adams's indignation. It is, he said, \"a\r\nquestion of far deeper root and more overshadowing branches than   (p. 266)\r\nany or all others that now agitate this country.... I had opened it by\r\nmy speech ... on the 25th May, 1836--by far the most noted speech that\r\nI ever made.\" He based his opposition to the annexation upon\r\nconstitutional objections, and on September 18, 1837, offered a\r\nresolution that \"the power of annexing the people of any independent\r\nState to this Union is a power not delegated by the Constitution of\r\nthe United States to their Congress or to any department of their\r\ngovernment, but reserved to the people.\" The Speaker refused to\r\nreceive the motion, or even allow it to be read, on the ground that it\r\nwas not in order. Mr. Adams repeated substantially the same motion in\r\nJune, 1838, then adding \"that any attempt by act of Congress or by\r\ntreaty to annex the Republic of Texas to this Union would be an\r\nusurpation of power which it would be the right and the duty of the\r\nfree people of the Union to resist and annul.\" The story of his\r\nopposition to this measure is, however, so interwoven with his general\r\nantagonism to slavery, that there is little occasion for treating them\r\nseparately.[9]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9: In an address to his constituents in\r\n                   September, 1842, Mr. Adams spoke of his course\r\n                   concerning Texas. Having mentioned Mr. Van Buren's\r\n                   reply, declining the formal proposition made in\r\n                   1837 by the Republic of Texas for annexation to the\r\n                   United States, he continued: \"But the\r\n                   slave-breeding passion for the annexation was not\r\n                   to be so disconcerted. At the ensuing session of\r\n                   Congress numerous petitions and memorials for and\r\n                   against the annexation were presented to the House,\r\n                   ... and were referred to the Committee of Foreign\r\n                   Affairs, who, without ever taking them into\r\n                   consideration, towards the close of the session\r\n                   asked to be discharged from the consideration of\r\n                   them all. It was on this report that the debate\r\n                   arose, in which I disclosed the whole system of\r\n                   duplicity and perfidy towards Mexico, which had\r\n                   marked the Jackson Administration from its\r\n                   commencement to its close. It silenced the clamors\r\n                   for the annexation of Texas to this Union for three\r\n                   years till the catastrophe of the Van Buren\r\n                   Administration. The people of the free States were\r\n                   lulled into the belief that the whole project was\r\n                   abandoned, and that they should hear no more of\r\n                   slave-trade cravings for the annexation of Texas.\r\n                   Had Harrison lived they would have heard no more of\r\n                   them to this day, but no sooner was John Tyler\r\n                   installed in the President's House than\r\n                   nullification and Texas and war with Mexico rose\r\n                   again upon the surface, with eye steadily fixed\r\n                   upon the Polar Star of Southern slave-dealing\r\n                   supremacy in the government of the Union.\"]\r\n\r\nPeople sometimes took advantage of his avowed principles           (p. 267)\r\nconcerning freedom of petition to put him in positions which they\r\nthought would embarrass him or render him ridiculous. Not much\r\nsuccess, however, attended these foolish efforts of shallow wits. It\r\nwas not easy to disconcert him or to take him at disadvantage. July\r\n28, 1841, he presented a paper of this character coming from sundry\r\nVirginians and praying that all the free colored population should be\r\nsold or expelled from the country. He simply stated as he handed in\r\nthe sheet that nothing could be more abhorrent to him than this    (p. 268)\r\nprayer, and that his respect for the right of petition was his\r\nonly motive for presenting this. It was suspended under the \"gag\"\r\nrule, and its promoters, unless very easily amused, must have been\r\nsadly disappointed with the fate and effect of their joke. On March 5,\r\n1838, he received from Rocky Mount in Virginia a letter and petition\r\npraying that the House would arraign at its bar and forever expel John\r\nQuincy Adams. He presented both documents, with a resolution asking\r\nthat they be referred to a committee for investigation and report. His\r\nenemies in the House saw that he was sure to have the best of the\r\nsport if the matter should be pursued, and succeeded in laying it on\r\nthe table. Waddy Thompson thoughtfully improved the opportunity to\r\nmention to Mr. Adams that he also had received a petition, \"numerously\r\nsigned,\" praying for Mr. Adams's expulsion, but had never presented\r\nit. In the following May Mr. Adams presented another petition of like\r\ntenor. Dromgoole said that he supposed it was a \"quiz,\" and that he\r\nwould move to lay it on the table, \"unless the gentleman from\r\nMassachusetts wished to give it another direction.\" Mr. Adams said\r\nthat \"the gentleman from Massachusetts cared very little about it,\"\r\nand it found the limbo of the \"table.\"\r\n\r\nTo this same period belongs the memorable tale of Mr. Adams's      (p. 269)\r\nattempt to present a petition from slaves. On February 6, 1837, he\r\nbrought in some two hundred abolition petitions. He closed with one\r\nagainst the slave-trade in the District of Columbia purporting to be\r\nsigned by \"nine ladies of Fredericksburg, Virginia,\" whom he declined\r\nto name because, as he said, in the present disposition of the\r\ncountry, \"he did not know what might happen to them if he did name\r\nthem.\" Indeed, he added, he was not sure that the petition was\r\ngenuine; he had said, when he began to present his petitions, that\r\nsome among them were so peculiar that he was in doubt as to their\r\ngenuineness, and this fell within the description. Apparently he had\r\nconcluded and was about to take his seat, when he quickly caught up\r\nanother sheet, and said that he held in his hand a paper concerning\r\nwhich he should wish to have the decision of the Speaker before\r\npresenting it. It purported to be a petition from twenty-two slaves,\r\nand he would like to know whether it came within the rule of the House\r\nconcerning petitions relating to slavery. The Speaker, in manifest\r\nconfusion, said that he could not answer the question until he knew\r\nthe contents of the document. Mr. Adams, remarking that \"it was one of\r\nthose petitions which had occurred to his mind as not being what   (p. 270)\r\nit purported to be,\" proposed to send it up to the Chair for\r\ninspection. Objection was made to this, and the Speaker said that the\r\ncircumstances were so extraordinary that he would take the sense of\r\nthe House. That body, at first inattentive, now became interested, and\r\nno sooner did a knowledge of what was going on spread among those\r\npresent than great excitement prevailed. Members were hastily brought\r\nin from the lobbies; many tried to speak, and from parts of the hall\r\ncries of \"Expel him! Expel him!\" were heard. For a brief interval no\r\none of the enraged Southerners was equal to the unforeseen emergency.\r\nMr. Haynes moved the rejection of the petition. Mr. Lewis deprecated\r\nthis motion, being of opinion that the House must inflict punishment\r\non the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. Haynes thereupon withdrew a\r\nmotion which was so obviously inadequate to the vindictive gravity of\r\nthe occasion. Mr. Grantland stood ready to second a motion to punish\r\nMr. Adams, and Mr. Lewis said that if punishment should not be meted\r\nout it would \"be better for the representatives from the slave-holding\r\nStates to go home at once.\" Mr. Alford said that so soon as the\r\npetition should be presented he would move that it should \"be taken\r\nfrom the House and burned.\" At last Mr. Thompson got a resolution  (p. 271)\r\ninto shape as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"That the Hon. John Quincy Adams, by the attempt just made by him\r\n     to introduce a petition purporting on its face to be from slaves,\r\n     has been guilty of a gross disrespect to this House, and that he\r\n     be instantly brought to the bar to receive the severe censure of\r\n     the Speaker.\"\r\n\r\nIn supporting this resolution he said that Mr. Adams's action was in\r\ngross and wilful violation of the rules of the House and an insult to\r\nits members. He even threatened criminal proceedings before the grand\r\njury of the District of Columbia, saying that if that body had the\r\n\"proper intelligence and spirit\" people might \"yet see an incendiary\r\nbrought to condign punishment.\" Mr. Haynes, not satisfied with Mr.\r\nThompson's resolution, proposed a substitute to the effect that Mr.\r\nAdams had \"rendered himself justly liable to the severest censure of\r\nthis House and is censured accordingly.\" Then there ensued a little\r\nmore excited speech-making and another resolution, that Mr. Adams,\r\n\r\n     \"by his attempt to introduce into this House a petition from\r\n     slaves for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia,\r\n     has committed an outrage on the feelings of the people of a large\r\n     portion of this Union; a flagrant contempt on the dignity     (p. 272)\r\n     of this House; and, by extending to slaves a privilege only\r\n     belonging to freemen, directly incites the slave population\r\n     to insurrection; and that the said member be forthwith called to\r\n     the bar of the House and be censured by the Speaker.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lewis remained of opinion that it might be best for the Southern\r\nmembers to go home,--a proposition which afterwards drew forth a\r\nflaming speech from Mr. Alford, who, far from inclining to go home,\r\nwas ready to stay \"until this fair city is a field of Waterloo and\r\nthis beautiful Potomac a river of blood.\" Mr. Patton, of Virginia, was\r\nthe first to speak a few words to bring members to their senses,\r\npertinently asking whether Mr. Adams had \"attempted to offer\" this\r\npetition, and whether it did indeed pray for the abolition of slavery.\r\nIt might be well, he suggested, for his friends to be sure of their\r\nfacts before going further. Then at last Mr. Adams, who had not at all\r\nlost his head in the general hurly-burly, rose and said, that amid\r\nthese numerous resolutions charging him with \"high crimes and\r\nmisdemeanors\" and calling him to the bar of the House to answer for\r\nthe same, he had thought it proper to remain silent until the House\r\nshould take some action; that he did not suppose that, if he should be\r\nbrought to the bar of the House, he should be \"struck mute by the  (p. 273)\r\nprevious question\" before he should have been given an opportunity to\r\n\"say a word or two\" in his own defence. As to the facts: \"I did not\r\npresent the petition,\" he said, \"and I appeal to the Speaker to say\r\nthat I did not.... I intended to take the decision of the Speaker\r\nbefore I went one step towards presenting or offering to present that\r\npetition.\" The contents of the petition, should the House ever choose\r\nto read it, he continued, would render necessary some amendments at\r\nleast in the last resolution, since the prayer was that slavery should\r\n_not_ be abolished!\" The gentleman from Alabama may perchance find,\r\nthat the object of this petition is precisely what he desires to\r\naccomplish; and that these slaves who have sent this paper to me are\r\nhis auxiliaries instead of being his opponents.\"\r\n\r\nThese remarks caused some discomfiture among the Southern members, who\r\nwere glad to have time for deliberation given them by a maundering\r\nspeech from Mr. Mann, of New York, who talked about \"the deplorable\r\nspectacle shown off every petition day by the honorable member from\r\nMassachusetts in presenting the abolition petitions of his infatuated\r\nfriends and constituents,\" charged Mr. Adams with running counter to\r\nthe sense of the whole country with a \"violence paralleled only    (p. 274)\r\nby the revolutionary madness of desperation,\" and twitted him with his\r\npolitical friendlessness, with his age, and with the insinuation of\r\nwaning faculties and judgment. This little phial having been emptied,\r\nMr. Thompson arose and angrily assailed Mr. Adams for contemptuously\r\ntrifling with the House, which charge he based upon the entirely\r\nunproved assumption that the petition was not a genuine document. He\r\nconcluded by presenting new resolutions better adapted to the recent\r\ndevelopment of the case:--\r\n\r\n     \"1. That the Hon. John Quincy Adams, by an effort to present a\r\n     petition from slaves, has committed a gross contempt of this\r\n     House.\r\n\r\n     \"2. That the member from Massachusetts above-named, by creating\r\n     the impression and leaving the House under such impression, that\r\n     the said petition was for the abolition of slavery, when he knew\r\n     that it was not, has trifled with the House.\r\n\r\n     \"3. That the Hon. John Quincy Adams receive the censure of the\r\n     House for his conduct referred to in the preceding resolutions.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Pinckney said that the avowal by Mr. Adams that he had in his\r\npossession the petition of slaves was an admission of communication\r\nwith slaves, and so was evidence of collusion with them; and that Mr.\r\nAdams had thus rendered himself indictable for aiding and abetting (p. 275)\r\ninsurrection. A _fortiori_, then, was he not amenable to the censure\r\nof the House? Mr. Haynes, of Georgia, forgetting that the petition had\r\nnot been presented, announced his intention of moving that it should\r\nbe rejected subject only to a permission for its withdrawal; another\r\nmember suggested that, if the petition should be disposed of by\r\nburning, it would be well to commit to the same combustion the\r\ngentleman who presented it.\r\n\r\nOn the next day some more resolutions were ready, prepared by\r\nDromgoole, who in his sober hours was regarded as the best\r\nparliamentarian in the Southern party. These were, that Mr. Adams\r\n\r\n     \"by stating in his place that he had in his possession a paper\r\n     purporting to be a petition from slaves, and inquiring if it came\r\n     within the meaning of a resolution heretofore adopted (as\r\n     preliminary to its presentation), has given color to the idea\r\n     that slaves have the right of petition and of his readiness to be\r\n     their organ; and that for the same he deserves the censure of the\r\n     House.\r\n\r\n     \"That the aforesaid John Quincy Adams receive a censure from the\r\n     Speaker in the presence of the House of Representatives.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Alford, in advocating these resolutions, talked about \"this awful\r\ncrisis of our beloved country.\" Mr. Robertson, though opposing     (p. 276)\r\nthe resolutions, took pains \"strongly to condemn ... the conduct of\r\nthe gentleman from Massachusetts.\" Mr. Adams's colleague, Mr. Lincoln,\r\nspoke in his behalf, so also did Mr. Evans, of Maine; and Caleb\r\nCushing made a powerful speech upon his side. Otherwise than this Mr.\r\nAdams was left to carry on the contest single-handed against the\r\nnumerous array of assailants, all incensed and many fairly savage. Yet\r\nit is a striking proof of the dread in which even the united body of\r\nhot-blooded Southerners stood of this hard fighter from the North,\r\nthat as the debate was drawing to a close, after they had all said\r\ntheir say and just before his opportunity came for making his\r\nelaborate speech of defence, they suddenly and opportunely became\r\nready to content themselves with a mild resolution, which condemned\r\ngenerally the presentation of petitions from slaves, and, for the\r\ndisposal of this particular case, recited that Mr. Adams had \"solemnly\r\ndisclaimed all design of doing anything disrespectful to the House,\"\r\nand had \"avowed his intention not to offer to present\" to the House\r\nthe petition of this kind held by him; that \"therefore all further\r\nproceedings in regard to his conduct do now cease.\" A sneaking effort\r\nby Mr. Vanderpoel to close Mr. Adams's mouth by moving the         (p. 277)\r\nprevious question involved too much cowardice to be carried; and so on\r\nFebruary 9 the sorely bated man was at last able to begin his final\r\nspeech. He conducted his defence with singular spirit and ability, but\r\nat too great length to admit of even a sketch of what he said. He\r\nclaimed the right of petition for slaves, and established it so far as\r\nargument can establish anything. He alleged that all he had done was\r\nto ask a question of the Speaker, and if he was to be censured for so\r\ndoing, then how much more, he asked, was the Speaker deserving of\r\ncensure who had even put the same question to the House, and given as\r\nhis reason for so doing that it was not only of novel but of difficult\r\nimport! He repudiated the idea that any member of the House could be\r\nheld by a grand jury to respond for words spoken in debate, and\r\nrecommended the gentlemen who had indulged in such preposterous\r\nthreats \"to study a little the first principles of civil liberty,\"\r\nexcoriating them until they actually arose and tried to explain away\r\ntheir own language. He cast infinite ridicule upon the unhappy\r\nexpression of Dromgoole, \"giving color to an idea.\" Referring to the\r\ndifficulty which he encountered by reason of the variety and disorder\r\nof the resolutions and charges against him with which \"gentlemen from\r\nthe South had pounced down upon him like so many eagles upon a     (p. 278)\r\ndove,\"--there was an exquisite sarcasm in the simile!--he said:\r\n\"When I take up one idea, before I can give color to the idea, it has\r\nalready changed its form and presents itself for consideration under\r\nother colors.... What defence can be made against this new crime of\r\ngiving color to ideas?\" As for trifling with the House by presenting a\r\npetition which in the course of debate had become pretty well known\r\nand acknowledged to be a hoax designed to lead Mr. Adams into a\r\nposition of embarrassment and danger, he disclaimed any such motive,\r\nreminding members that he had given warning, when beginning to present\r\nhis petitions, that he was suspicious that some among them might not\r\nbe genuine.[10] But while denying all intention of trifling with the\r\nHouse, he rejected the mercy extended to him in the last of the    (p. 279)\r\nlong series of resolutions before that body. \"I disclaim not,\" he\r\nsaid, \"any particle of what I have done, not a single word of what I\r\nhave said do I unsay; nay, I am ready to do and to say the same\r\nto-morrow.\" He had no notion of aiding in making a loophole through\r\nwhich his blundering enemies might escape, even though he himself\r\nshould be accorded the privilege of crawling through it with them. At\r\ntimes during his speech \"there was great agitation in the House,\" but\r\nwhen he closed no one seemed ambitious to reply. His enemies had\r\nlearned anew a lesson, often taught to them before and often to be\r\nimpressed upon them again, that it was perilous to come to close\r\nquarters with Mr. Adams. They gave up all idea of censuring him, and\r\nwere content to apply a very mild emollient to their own smarting\r\nwounds in the shape of a resolution, to the effect that slaves did not\r\npossess the right of petition secured by the Constitution to the\r\npeople of the United States.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10: Mr. Adams afterward said: \"I believed\r\n                   the petition signed by female names to be\r\n                   genuine.... I had suspicions that the other,\r\n                   purporting to be from slaves, came really from the\r\n                   hand of a master who had prevailed on his slaves to\r\n                   sign it, that they might have the appearance of\r\n                   imploring the members from the North to cease\r\n                   offering petitions for their emancipation, which\r\n                   could have no other tendency than to aggravate\r\n                   their servitude, and of being so impatient under\r\n                   the operation of petitions in their favor as to\r\n                   pray that the Northern members who should persist\r\n                   in presenting them should be expelled.\" It was a\r\n                   part of the prayer of the petition that Mr. Adams\r\n                   should be expelled if he should continue to present\r\n                   abolition petitions.]\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1842-43 the questions arising out of the affair of\r\nthe Creole rendered the position then held by Mr. Adams at the head of\r\nthe House Committee on Foreign Affairs exceedingly distasteful to the\r\nslave-holders. On January 21, 1842, a somewhat singular            (p. 280)\r\nmanifestation of this feeling was made when Mr. Adams himself\r\npresented a petition from Georgia praying for his removal from this\r\nChairmanship. Upon this he requested to be heard in his own behalf.\r\nThe Southern party, not sanguine of any advantage from debating the\r\nmatter, tried to lay it on the table. The petition was alleged by\r\nHabersham, of Georgia, to be undoubtedly another hoax. But Mr. Adams,\r\nloath to lose a good opportunity, still claimed to be heard on the\r\ncharges made against him by the \"infamous slave-holders.\" Mr. Smith,\r\nof Virginia, said that the House had lately given Mr. Adams leave to\r\ndefend himself against the charge of monomania, and asked whether he\r\nwas doing so. Some members cried \"Yes! Yes!\"; others shouted \"No! he\r\nis establishing the fact.\" The wrangling was at last brought to an end\r\nby the Speaker's declaration, that the petition must lie over for the\r\npresent. But the scene had been only the prelude to one much longer,\r\nfiercer, and more exciting. No sooner was the document thus\r\ntemporarily disposed of than Mr. Adams rose and presented the petition\r\nof forty-five citizens of Haverhill, Massachusetts, praying the House\r\n\"immediately to adopt measures peaceably to dissolve the union of\r\nthese States,\" for the alleged cause of the incompatibility        (p. 281)\r\nbetween free and slave-holding communities. He moved \"its reference to\r\na select committee, with instructions to report an answer to the\r\npetitioners showing the reasons why the prayer of it ought not to be\r\ngranted.\"\r\n\r\nIn a moment the House was aflame with excitement. The numerous members\r\nwho hated Mr. Adams thought that at last he was experiencing the\r\ndivinely sent madness which foreruns destruction. Those who sought his\r\npolitical annihilation felt that the appointed and glorious hour of\r\nextinction had come; those who had writhed beneath the castigation of\r\nhis invective exulted in the near revenge. While one said that the\r\npetition should never have been brought within the walls of the House,\r\nand another wished to burn it in the presence of the members, Mr.\r\nGilmer, of Virginia, offered a resolution, that in presenting the\r\npetition Mr. Adams \"had justly incurred the censure of the House.\"\r\nSome objection was made to this resolution as not being in order; but\r\nMr. Adams said that he hoped that it would be received and debated and\r\nthat an opportunity would be given him to speak in his own defence;\r\n\"especially as the gentleman from Virginia had thought proper to play\r\nsecond fiddle to his colleague[11] from Accomac.\" Mr. Gilmer retorted\r\nthat he \"played second fiddle to no man. He was no fiddler, but    (p. 282)\r\nwas endeavoring to prevent the music of him who,\r\n\r\n  'In the space of one revolving moon,\r\n  Was statesman, poet, fiddler, and buffoon.'\"\r\n\r\nThe resolution was then laid on the table. The House rose, and Mr.\r\nAdams went home and noted in his Diary, \"evening in meditation,\" for\r\nwhich indeed he had abundant cause. On the following day Thomas F.\r\nMarshall, of Kentucky, offered a substitute for Gilmer's resolution.\r\nThis new fulmination had been prepared in a caucus of forty members of\r\nthe slave-holding party, and was long and carefully framed. Its\r\npreamble recited, in substance, that a petition to dissolve the Union,\r\nproposing to Congress to destroy that which the several members had\r\nsolemnly and officially sworn to support, was a \"high breach of\r\nprivilege, a contempt offered to this House, a direct proposition to\r\nthe Legislature and each member of it to commit perjury, and involving\r\nnecessarily in its execution and its consequences the destruction of\r\nour country and the crime of high treason:\" wherefore it was to be\r\nresolved that Mr. Adams, in presenting a petition for dissolution, had\r\n\"offered the deepest indignity to the House\" and \"an insult to the\r\npeople;\" that if \"this outrage\" should be \"permitted to pass unrebuked\r\nand unpunished\" he would have \"disgraced his country ... in the    (p. 283)\r\neyes of the whole world;\" that for this insult and this \"wound at\r\nthe Constitution and existence of his country, the peace, the security\r\nand liberty of the people of these States\" he \"might well be held to\r\nmerit expulsion from the national councils;\" and that \"the House deem\r\nit an act of grace and mercy when they only inflict upon him their\r\nseverest censure;\" that so much they must do \"for the maintenance of\r\ntheir own purity and dignity; for the rest they turned him over to his\r\nown conscience and the indignation of all true American citizens.\"\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11: Henry A. Wise.]\r\n\r\nThese resolutions were then advocated by Mr. Marshall at great length\r\nand with extreme bitterness. Mr. Adams replied shortly, stating that\r\nhe should wish to make his full defence at a later stage of the\r\ndebate. Mr. Wise followed in a personal and acrimonious harangue; Mr.\r\nEverett[12] gave some little assistance to Mr. Adams, and the House\r\nagain adjourned. The following day Wise continued his speech, very\r\nelaborately. When he closed, Mr. Adams, who had \"determined not to\r\ninterrupt him till he had discharged his full cargo of filthy invective,\"\r\nrose to \"make a preliminary point.\" He questioned the right of the\r\nHouse to entertain Marshall's resolutions since the preamble assumed\r\nhim to be guilty of the crimes of subornation of perjury and       (p. 284)\r\ntreason, and the resolutions themselves censured him as if he had been\r\nfound guilty; whereas in fact he had not been tried upon these charges\r\nand of course had not been convicted. If he was to be brought to trial\r\nupon them he asserted his right to have the proceedings conducted\r\nbefore a jury of his peers, and that the House was not a tribunal\r\nhaving this authority. But if he was to be tried for contempt, for\r\nwhich alone he could lawfully be tried by the House, still there were\r\nan hundred members sitting on its benches who were morally\r\ndisqualified to judge him, who could not give him an impartial trial,\r\nbecause they were prejudiced and the question was one \"on which their\r\npersonal, pecuniary, and most sordid interests were at stake.\" Such\r\nconsiderations, he said, ought to prevent many gentlemen from voting,\r\nas Mr. Wise had avowed that they would prevent him. Here Wise\r\ninterrupted to disavow that he was influenced by any such reasons, but\r\nrather, he said, by the \"personal loathing, dread, and contempt I feel\r\nfor the man.\" Mr. Adams, continuing after this pleasant interjection,\r\nadmitted that he was in the power of the majority, who might try him\r\nagainst law and condemn him against right if they would.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12: Horace Everett, of Vermont.]\r\n\r\n     \"If they say they will try me, they must try me. If they      (p. 285)\r\n     say they will punish me, they must punish me. But if they say\r\n     that in peace and mercy they will spare me expulsion, I disdain\r\n     and cast away their mercy; and I ask them if they will come to\r\n     such a trial and expel me. I defy them. I have constituents to go\r\n     to who will have something to say if this House expels me. Nor\r\n     will it be long before the gentlemen will see me here again.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the fierce temper and indomitable courage of this inflexible\r\nold man! He flung contempt in the face of those who had him wholly in\r\ntheir power, and in the same breath in which he acknowledged that\r\npower he dared them to use it. He charged Wise with the guilt of\r\ninnocent blood, in connection with certain transactions in a duel, and\r\nexasperated that gentleman into crying out that the \"charge made by\r\nthe gentleman from Massachusetts was as base and black a lie as the\r\ntraitor was base and black who uttered it.\" When he was asked by the\r\nSpeaker to put his point of order in writing,--his own request to the\r\nlike effect in another case having been refused shortly before,--he\r\ntauntingly congratulated that gentleman \"upon his discovery of the\r\nexpediency of having points of order reduced to writing--a favor which\r\nhe had repeatedly denied to me.\" When Mr. Wise was speaking, \"I\r\ninterrupted him occasionally,\" says Mr. Adams, \"sometimes to       (p. 286)\r\nprovoke him into absurdity.\" As usual he was left to fight out his\r\ndesperate battle substantially single-handed. Only Mr. Everett\r\noccasionally helped him a very little; while one or two others who\r\nspoke against the resolutions were careful to explain that they felt\r\nno personal good will towards Mr. Adams. But he faced the odds\r\ncourageously. It was no new thing for him to be pitted alone against a\r\n\"solid South.\" Outside the walls of the House he had some sympathy and\r\nsome assistance tendered him by individuals, among others by Rufus\r\nChoate then in the Senate, and by his own colleagues from\r\nMassachusetts. This support aided and cheered him somewhat, but could\r\nnot prevent substantially the whole burden of the labor and brunt of\r\nthe contest from bearing upon him alone. Among the external\r\nmanifestations of feeling, those of hostility were naturally largely\r\nin the ascendant. The newspapers of Washington--the \"Globe\" and the\r\n\"National Intelligencer\"--which reported the debates, daily filled\r\ntheir columns with all the abuse and invective which was poured forth\r\nagainst him, while they gave the most meagre statements, or none at\r\nall, of what he said in his own defence. Among other amenities he\r\nreceived from North Carolina an anonymous letter threatening him with\r\nassassination, having also an engraved portrait of him with the    (p. 287)\r\nmark of a rifle-ball in the forehead, and the motto \"to stop the\r\nmusic of John Quincy Adams,\" etc., etc. This missive he read and\r\ndisplayed in the House, but it was received with profound indifference\r\nby men who would not have greatly objected to the execution of the\r\nbarbarous threat.\r\n\r\nThe prolonged struggle cost him deep anxiety and sleepless nights,\r\nwhich in the declining years of a laborious life told hardly upon his\r\naged frame. But against all odds of numbers and under all\r\ndisadvantages of circumstances the past repeated itself, and Mr. Adams\r\nalone won a victory over all the cohorts of the South. Several\r\nattempts had been made during the debate to lay the whole subject on\r\nthe table. Mr. Adams said that he would consent to this simply because\r\nhis defence would be a very long affair, and he did not wish to have\r\nthe time of the House consumed and the business of the nation brought\r\nto a stand solely for the consideration of his personal affairs. These\r\npropositions failing, he began his speech and soon was making such\r\nheadway that even his adversaries were constrained to see that the\r\nopportunity which they had conceived to be within their grasp was\r\neluding them, as had so often happened before. Accordingly on February\r\n7 the motion to \"lay the whole subject on the table forever\" was   (p. 288)\r\nrenewed and carried by one hundred and six votes to ninety-three.\r\nThe House then took up the original petition and refused to receive it\r\nby one hundred and sixty-six to forty. No sooner was this consummation\r\nreached than the irrepressible champion rose to his feet and proceeded\r\nwith his budget of anti-slavery petitions, of which he \"presented\r\nnearly two hundred, till the House adjourned.\"\r\n\r\nWithin a very short time there came further and convincing proof that\r\nMr. Adams was victor. On February 26 he writes: \"D. D. Barnard told me\r\nhe had received a petition from his District, signed by a small number\r\nof very respectable persons, praying for a dissolution of the Union.\r\nHe said he did not know what to do with it. I dined with him.\" By\r\nMarch 14 this dinner bore fruit. Mr. Barnard had made up his mind\r\n\"what to do with it.\" He presented it, with a motion that it be\r\nreferred to a select committee with instructions to report adversely\r\nto its prayer. The well-schooled House now took the presentation\r\nwithout a ripple of excitement, and was content with simply voting not\r\nto receive the petition.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the toil and anxiety imposed upon Mr. Adams by this\r\neffort to censure and disgrace him, the scheme, already referred to,\r\nfor displacing him from the chairmanship of the Committee on       (p. 289)\r\nForeign Affairs had been actively prosecuted. He was notified that the\r\nSouthern members had formed a cabal for removing him and putting Caleb\r\nCushing in his place. The plan was, however, temporarily checked, and\r\nso soon as Mr. Adams had triumphed in the House the four Southern\r\nmembers of the committee sent to the House a paper begging to be\r\nexcused from further services on the committee, \"because from recent\r\noccurrences it was doubtful whether the House would remove the\r\nchairman, and they were unwilling to serve with one in whom they had\r\nno confidence.\" The fugitives were granted, \"by a shout of\r\nacclamation,\" the excuse which they sought for so welcome a reason,\r\nand the same was also done for a fifth member. Three more of the same\r\nparty, nominated to fill these vacancies, likewise asked to be\r\nexcused, and were so. Their letters preferring this request were \"so\r\ninsulting personally\" to Mr. Adams as to constitute \"gross breaches of\r\nprivilege.\" \"The Speaker would have refused to receive or present them\r\nhad they referred to any other man in the House.\" They were published,\r\nbut Mr. Adams, after some hesitation, determined not to give them the\r\nimportance which would result from any public notice in the House upon\r\nhis part. He could afford to keep silence, and judged wisely in doing\r\nso.\r\n\r\nAmid all the animosity and rancor entertained towards Mr. Adams,   (p. 290)\r\nthere yet lurked a degree of respect for his courage, honesty, and\r\nability which showed itself upon occasion, doubtless not a little to\r\nthe surprise of the members themselves who were hardly conscious that\r\nthey entertained such sentiments until startled into a manifestation\r\nof them. An eminent instance of this is to be found in the story of\r\nthe troubled days preceding the organization of the twenty-sixth\r\nCongress. On December 2, 1839, the members elect of that body came\r\ntogether in Washington, with the knowledge that the seats of five\r\ngentlemen from New Jersey, who brought with them the regular\r\ngubernatorial certificate of their election, would be contested by\r\nfive other claimants. According to custom Garland, clerk of the last\r\nHouse, called the assemblage to order and began the roll-call. When he\r\ncame to New Jersey he called the name of one member from that State,\r\nand then said that there were five other seats which were contested,\r\nand that not feeling authorized to decide the dispute he would pass\r\nover the names of the New Jersey members and proceed with the roll\r\ntill the House should be formed, when the question could be decided.\r\nPlausible as appeared this abstention from an exercise of authority in\r\nso grave a dispute, it was nevertheless really an assumption and   (p. 291)\r\nnot a deprecation of power, and as such was altogether unjustifiable.\r\nThe clerk's sole business was to call the names of those persons who\r\npresented the usual formal credentials; he had no right to take\r\ncognizance that the seats of any such persons might be the subject of\r\na contest, which could properly be instituted, conducted, and\r\ndetermined only before and by the House itself when organized. But his\r\ncourse was not innocent of a purpose. So evenly was the House divided\r\nthat the admission or exclusion of these five members in the first\r\ninstance would determine the political complexion of the body. The\r\nmembers holding the certificates were Whigs; if the clerk could keep\r\nthem out until the organization of the House should be completed, then\r\nthe Democrats would control that organization, would elect their\r\nSpeaker, and through him would make up the committees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Henry A. Wise]\r\n\r\nNaturally enough this arrogation of power by the clerk, the motives\r\nand consequences of which were abundantly obvious, raised a terrible\r\nstorm. The debate continued till four o'clock in the afternoon, when a\r\nmotion was made to adjourn. The clerk said that he could put no\r\nquestion, not even of adjournment, till the House should be formed.\r\nBut there was a general cry to adjourn, and the clerk declared the\r\nHouse adjourned. Mr. Adams went home and wrote in his Diary that   (p. 292)\r\nthe clerk's \"two decisions form together an insurmountable objection\r\nto the transaction of any business, and an impossibility of organizing\r\nthe House.... The most curious part of the case is, that his own\r\nelection as clerk depends upon the exclusion of the New Jersey\r\nmembers.\" The next day was consumed in a fierce debate as to whether\r\nthe clerk should be allowed to read an explanatory statement. Again\r\nthe clerk refused to put the question of adjournment, but, \"upon\r\ninspection,\" declared an adjournment. Some called out \"a count! a\r\ncount!\" while most rushed out of the hall, and Wise cried loudly, \"Now\r\nwe are a mob!\" The next day there was more violent debating, but no\r\nprogress towards a decision. Various party leaders offered\r\nresolutions, none of which accomplished anything. The condition was\r\nridiculous, disgraceful, and not without serious possibilities of\r\ndanger. Neither did any light of encouragement break in any quarter.\r\nIn the crisis there seemed, by sudden consent of all, to be a turning\r\ntowards Mr. Adams. Prominent men of both parties came to him and\r\nbegged him to interfere. He was reluctant to plunge into the\r\nembroilment; but the great urgency and the abundant assurances of\r\nsupport placed little less than actual compulsion upon him.\r\nAccordingly on December 5 he rose to address the House. He was     (p. 293)\r\ngreeted as a _Deus ex machina_. Not speaking to the clerk, but turning\r\ndirectly to the assembled members, he began: \"Fellow citizens! Members\r\nelect of the twenty-sixth Congress!\" He could not resist the temptation\r\nof administering a brief but severe and righteous castigation to\r\nGarland; and then, ignoring that functionary altogether, proceeded to\r\nbeg the House to _organize itself_. To this end he said that he would\r\noffer a resolution \"ordering the clerk to call the members from New\r\nJersey possessing the credentials from the Governor of that State.\"\r\nThere had been already no lack of resolutions, but the difficulty lay\r\nin the clerk's obstinate refusal to put the question upon them. So now\r\nthe puzzled cry went up: \"How shall the question be put?\" \"I intend to\r\nput the question myself,\" said the dauntless old man, wholly equal to\r\nthe emergency. A tumult of applause resounded upon all sides. Rhett,\r\nof South Carolina, sprang up and offered a resolution, that Williams,\r\nof North Carolina, the oldest member of the House, be appointed\r\nchairman of the meeting; but upon objection by Williams, he\r\nsubstituted the name of Mr. Adams, and put the question. He was\r\n\"answered by an almost universal shout in the affirmative.\" Whereupon\r\nRhett and Williams conducted the old man to the chair. It was a    (p. 294)\r\nproud moment. Wise, of Virginia, afterward said, addressing a\r\ncomplimentary speech to Mr. Adams, \"and if, when you shall be gathered\r\nto your fathers, I were asked to select the words which in my judgment\r\nare calculated to give at once the best character of the man, I would\r\ninscribe upon your tomb this sentence, 'I will put the question\r\nmyself!'\" Doubtless Wise and a good many more would have been glad\r\nenough to put almost any epitaph on a tombstone for Mr. Adams.[13] It\r\nmust, however, be acknowledged that the impetuous Southerners behaved\r\nvery handsomely by their arch foe on this occasion, and were for once\r\nas chivalrous in fact as they always were in profession.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13: Not quite two years later, pending a\r\n                   motion to reprimand Mr. Wise for fighting with a\r\n                   member on the floor of the House, that gentleman\r\n                   took pains insultingly to say, \"that there was but\r\n                   one man in the House whose judgment he was\r\n                   unwilling to abide by,\" and that man was Mr.\r\n                   Adams.]\r\n\r\nSmooth water had by no means been reached when Mr. Adams was placed at\r\nthe helm; on the contrary, the buffeting became only the more severe\r\nwhen the members were no longer restrained by a lurking dread of grave\r\ndisaster if not of utter shipwreck. Between two bitterly incensed and\r\nevenly divided parties engaged in a struggle for an important prize,\r\nMr. Adams, having no strictly lawful authority pertaining to       (p. 295)\r\nhis singular and anomalous position, was hard taxed to perform his\r\nfunctions. It is impossible to follow the intricate and acrimonious\r\nquarrels of the eleven days which succeeded until on December 16, upon\r\nthe eleventh ballot, R. M. T. Hunter, of Virginia, was elected Speaker,\r\nand Mr. Adams was relieved from the most arduous duty imposed upon him\r\nduring his life. In the course of the debates there had been \"much\r\nvituperation and much equally unacceptable compliment\" lavished upon\r\nhim. After the organization of the House, there was some talk of\r\nmoving a vote of thanks, but he entreated that it should not be done.\r\n\"In the rancorous and bitter temper of the Administration party,\r\nexasperated by their disappointment in losing their Speaker, the\r\nresolution of thanks,\" he said, \"would have been lost if it had been\r\noffered.\" However this might have been, history has determined this\r\noccurrence to have been one of the most brilliant episodes in a life\r\nwhich had many distinctions.\r\n\r\nA few incidents indicative of respect must have been welcome enough in\r\nthe solitary fight-laden career of Mr. Adams. He needed some\r\noccasional encouragement to keep him from sinking into despondency;\r\nfor though he was of so unyielding and belligerent a disposition, of\r\nsuch ungracious demeanor, so uncompromising with friend and foe,   (p. 296)\r\nyet he was a man of deep and strong feelings, and in a way even\r\nvery sensitive though a proud reserve kept the secret of this quality\r\nso close that few suspected it. His Diary during his Congressional\r\nlife shows a man doing his duty sternly rather than cheerfully,\r\ntreading resolutely a painful path, having the reward which attends\r\nupon a clear conscience, but neither light-hearted nor often even\r\nhappy. Especially he was frequently disappointed at the returns which\r\nhe received from others, and considered himself \"ill-treated by every\r\npublic man whom circumstances had brought into competition with him;\"\r\nthey had returned his \"acts of kindness and services\" with \"gross\r\ninjustice.\" The reflection did not induce him to deflect his course in\r\nthe least, but it was made with much bitterness of spirit. Toward the\r\nclose of 1835 he writes:--\r\n\r\n     \"Among the dark spots in human nature which in the course of my\r\n     life I have observed, the devices of rivals to ruin me have been\r\n     sorry pictures of the heart of man.... H. G. Otis, Theophilus\r\n     Parsons, Timothy Pickering, James A. Bayard, Henry Clay, Jonathan\r\n     Russell, William H. Crawford, John C. Calhoun, Andrew Jackson,\r\n     Daniel Webster, and John Davis, W. B. Giles, and John Randolph,\r\n     have used up their faculties in base and dirty tricks to thwart\r\n     my progress in life and destroy my character.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTruly a long and exhaustive list of enmities! One can but suspect  (p. 297)\r\nthat a man of so many quarrels must have been quarrelsome. Certain it\r\nis, however, that in nearly every difference which Mr. Adams had in\r\nhis life a question of right and wrong, of moral or political\r\nprinciple, had presented itself to him. His intention was always good,\r\nthough his manner was so habitually irritating. He himself says that\r\nto nearly all these men--Russell alone specifically excepted--he had\r\n\"returned good for evil,\" that he had \"never wronged any one of them,\"\r\nand had even \"neglected too much his self-defence against them.\" In\r\nOctober, 1833, he said: \"I subject myself to so much toil and so much\r\nenmity, with so very little apparent fruit, that I sometimes ask\r\nmyself whether I do not mistake my own motives. The best actions of my\r\nlife make me nothing but enemies.\" In February, 1841, he made a\r\npowerful speech in castigation of Henry A. Wise, who had been\r\nupholding in Southern fashion slavery, duelling, and nullification. He\r\nreceived afterward some messages of praise and sympathy, but noted\r\nwith pain that his colleagues thought it one of his \"eccentric, wild,\r\nextravagant freaks of passion;\" and with a pathetic sense of\r\nloneliness he adds: \"All around me is cold and discouraging and my own\r\nfeelings are wound up to a pitch that my reason can scarcely       (p. 298)\r\nendure.\" A few days later he had the pleasure of hearing one of the\r\nmembers say, in a speech, that there was an opinion among many that\r\nMr. Adams was insane and did not know what he said. While a fight was\r\ngoing on such incidents only fired his blood, but afterwards the\r\nreminiscence affected his spirits cruelly.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1840, he writes that he has been twelve years submitting in\r\nsilence to the \"foulest and basest aspersions,\" to which it would have\r\nbeen waste of time to make reply, since the public ear had not been\r\nopen to him. \"Is the time arriving,\" he asks, \"for me to speak? or\r\nmust I go down to the grave and leave posterity to do justice to my\r\nfather and to me?\"\r\n\r\nHe has had at least the advantage of saying his say to posterity in a\r\nvery effective and convincing shape in that Diary, which so discomfited\r\nand enraged General Jackson. There is plain enough speaking in its\r\npages, which were a safety valve whereby much wrath escaped. Mr. Adams\r\nhad the faculty of forcible expression when he chose to employ it, as\r\nmay be seen from a few specimen sentences. On March 28, 1840, he\r\nremarks that Atherton \"this day emitted half an hour of his rotten\r\nbreath against\" a pending bill. Atherton was infamous as the mover of\r\nthe \"gag\" resolution, and Mr. Adams abhorred him accordingly.      (p. 299)\r\nDuncan, of Cincinnati, mentioned as \"delivering a dose of balderdash,\"\r\nis described as \"the prime bully of the Kinderhook Democracy,\" without\r\n\"perception of any moral distinction between truth and falsehood, ...\r\na thorough-going hack-demagogue, coarse, vulgar, and impudent, with a\r\nvein of low humor exactly suited to the rabble of a popular city and\r\nequally so to the taste of the present House of Representatives.\"\r\nOther similar bits of that pessimism and belief in the deterioration\r\nof the times, so common in old men, occasionally appear. In August,\r\n1835, he thinks that \"the signs of the times are portentous. All the\r\ntendencies of legislation are to the removal of restrictions from the\r\nvicious and the guilty, and to the exercise of all the powers of\r\ngovernment, legislative, judicial, and executive, by lawless\r\nassemblages of individuals.\" December 27, 1838, he looks upon the\r\nSenate and the House, \"the cream of the land, the culled darlings of\r\nfifteen millions,\" and observes that \"the remarkable phenomenon that\r\nthey present is the level of intellect and of morals upon which they\r\nstand; and this universal mediocrity is the basis upon which the\r\nliberties of this nation repose.\" In July, 1840, he thinks that\r\n\r\n     \"parties are falling into profligate factions. I have seen this\r\n     before; but the worst symptom now is the change in the        (p. 300)\r\n     manners of the people. The continuance of the present Administration\r\n     ... will open wide all the flood-gates of corruption. Will a change\r\n     produce reform? Pause and ponder! Slavery, the Indians, the public\r\n     lands, the collection and disbursement of public money, the tariff,\r\n     and foreign affairs:--what is to become of them?\"\r\n\r\nOn January 29, 1841, Henry A. Wise uttered \"a motley compound of\r\neloquence and folly, of braggart impudence and childish vanity, of\r\nself-laudation and Virginian narrow-mindedness.\" After him Hubbard, of\r\nAlabama, \"began grunting against the tariff.\" Three days later Black,\r\nof Georgia, \"poured forth his black bile\" for an hour and a half. The\r\nnext week we find Clifford, of Maine, \"muddily bothering his trickster\r\ninvention\" to get over a rule of the House, and \"snapping like a\r\nmackerel at a red rag\" at the suggestion of a way to do so. In July,\r\n1841, we again hear of Atherton as a \"cross-grained numskull ...\r\nsnarling against the loan bill.\" With such peppery passages in great\r\nabundance the Diary is thickly and piquantly besprinkled. They are not\r\nalways pleasant, perhaps not even always amusing, but they display the\r\nmarked element of censoriousness in Mr. Adams's character, which it is\r\nnecessary to appreciate in order to understand some parts of his\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Adams never had the cheerful support of popularity, so      (p. 301)\r\nneither did he often have the encouragement of success. He said that\r\nhe was paying in his declining years for the good luck which had\r\nattended the earlier portion of his life. On December 14, 1833, he\r\ncalculates that he has three fourths of the people of Massachusetts\r\nagainst him, and by estranging the anti-Masons he is about to become\r\nobnoxious to the whole. \"My public life will terminate by the\r\nalienation from me of all mankind.... It is the experience of all ages\r\nthat the people grow weary of old men. I cannot flatter myself that I\r\nshall escape the common law of our nature.\" Yet he acknowledges that\r\nhe is unable to \"abstract himself from the great questions which\r\nagitate the country.\" Soon after he again writes in the same vein: \"To\r\nbe forsaken by all mankind seems to be the destiny that awaits my last\r\ndays.\" August 6, 1835, he gives as his reason for not accepting an\r\ninvitation to deliver a discourse, that \"instead of having any\r\nbeneficial influence upon the public mind, it would be turned as an\r\ninstrument of obloquy against myself.\" So it had been, as he enumerates,\r\nwith his exertions against Freemasonry, his labors for internal\r\nimprovement, for the manufacturing interest, for domestic industry,\r\nfor free labor, for the disinterested aid then lately brought      (p. 302)\r\nby him to Jackson in the dispute with France; \"so it will be to the\r\nend of my political life.\"\r\n\r\nWhen to unpopularity and reiterated disappointment we add the physical\r\nills of old age, it no longer surprises us to find Mr. Adams at times\r\nharsh and bitter beyond the excuse of the occasion. That he was a man\r\nof strong physique and of extraordinary powers of endurance, often\r\nsurpassing those of young and vigorous men, is evident. For example,\r\none day in March, 1840, he notes incidentally: \"I walked home and\r\nfound my family at dinner. From my breakfast yesterday morning until\r\none this afternoon, twenty-eight hours, I had fasted.\" Many a time he\r\nshowed like, if not quite equal vigor. But he had been a hard worker\r\nall his life, and testing the powers of one's constitution does not\r\ntend to their preservation; he was by no means free from the woes of\r\nthe flesh or from the depression which comes with years and the dread\r\nof decrepitude. Already as early as October 7, 1833, he fears that his\r\nhealth is \"irretrievable;\" he gets but five hours a night of\r\n\"disturbed unquiet sleep--full of tossings.\" February 17, 1834, his\r\n\"voice was so hoarse and feeble that it broke repeatedly, and he could\r\nscarcely articulate. It is gone forever,\" he very mistakenly but\r\ndespondingly adds, \"and it is in vain for me to contend against    (p. 303)\r\nthe decay of time and nature.\" His enemies found little truth in this\r\nforeboding for many sessions thereafter. Only a year after he had\r\nperformed his feat of fasting for twenty-eight hours of business, he\r\nreceived a letter from a stranger advising him to retire. He admits\r\nthat perhaps he ought to do so, but says that more than sixty years of\r\npublic life have made activity necessary to him; it is the \"weakness\r\nof his nature\" which he has \"intellect enough left to perceive but not\r\nenergy to control,\" so that \"the world will retire from me before I\r\nshall retire from the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe brief sketch which can be given in a volume of this size of so\r\nlong and so busy a life does not suffice even to indicate all its many\r\nindustries. The anti-slavery labors of Mr. Adams during his Congressional\r\ncareer were alone an abundant occupation for a man in the prime of\r\nlife; but to these he added a wonderful list of other toils and\r\ninterests. He was not only an incessant student in history, politics,\r\nand literature, but he also constantly invaded the domain of science.\r\nHe was Chairman of the Congressional Committee on the Smithsonian\r\nbequest, and for several years he gave much time and attention to it,\r\nstriving to give the fund a direction in favor of science; he      (p. 304)\r\nhoped to make it subservient to a plan which he had long cherished for\r\nthe building of a noble national observatory. He had much committee\r\nwork; he received many visitors; he secured hours of leisure for his\r\nfavorite pursuit of composing poetry; he delivered an enormous number\r\nof addresses and speeches upon all sorts of occasions; he conducted an\r\nextensive correspondence; he was a very devout man, regularly going to\r\nchurch and reading three chapters in his Bible every day; and he kept\r\nup faithfully his colossal Diary. For several months in the midst of\r\nCongressional duties he devoted great labor, thought, and anxiety to\r\nthe famous cause of the slaves of the Amistad, in which he was induced\r\nto act as counsel before the Supreme Court. Such were the labors of\r\nhis declining age. To men of ordinary calibre the multiplicity of his\r\nacquirements and achievements is confounding and incredible. He worked\r\nhis brain and his body as unsparingly as if they had been machines\r\ninsensible to the pleasure or necessity of rest. Surprisingly did they\r\nsubmit to his exacting treatment, lasting in good order and condition\r\nfar beyond what was then the average of life and vigorous faculties\r\namong his contemporaries engaged in public affairs.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1842, while he was still tarrying in the unwholesome    (p. 305)\r\nheats of Washington, he had some symptoms which he thought premonitory,\r\nand he speaks of the next session of Congress as probably the last\r\nwhich he should ever attend. March 25, 1844, he gives a painful sketch\r\nof himself. Physical disability, he says, must soon put a stop to his\r\nDiary. That morning he had risen \"at four, and with smarting,\r\nbloodshot eyes and shivering hand, still sat down and wrote to fill up\r\nthe chasm of the closing days of last week.\" If his remaining days\r\nwere to be few he was at least resolved to make them long for purposes\r\nof unremitted labor.\r\n\r\nBut he had one great joy and distinguished triumph still in store for\r\nhim. From the time when the \"gag\" rule had been first established, Mr.\r\nAdams had kept up an unbroken series of attacks upon it at all times\r\nand by all means. At the beginning of the several sessions, when the\r\nrules were established by the House, he always moved to strike out\r\nthis one. Year after year his motion was voted down, but year after\r\nyear he renewed it with invincible perseverance. The majorities\r\nagainst him began to dwindle till they became almost imperceptible; in\r\n1842 it was a majority of four; in 1843, of three; in 1844 the\r\nstruggle was protracted for weeks, and Mr. Adams all but carried the\r\nday. It was evident that victory was not far off, and a kind fate  (p. 306)\r\nhad destined him to live not only to see but himself to win it.\r\nOn December 3, 1844, he made his usual motion and called for the yeas\r\nand nays; a motion was made to lay his motion on the table, and upon\r\nthat also the question was taken by yeas and nays--eighty-one yeas,\r\none hundred and four nays, and his motion was _not_ laid on the table.\r\nThe question was then put upon it, and it was carried by the handsome\r\nvote of one hundred and eight to eighty. In that moment the \"gag\" rule\r\nbecame a thing of the past, and Mr. Adams had conquered in his last\r\nfight. \"Blessed, forever blessed, be the name of God!\" he writes in\r\nrecording the event. A week afterwards some anti-slavery petitions\r\nwere received and actually referred to the Committee on the District\r\nof Columbia. This glorious consummation having been achieved, this\r\nadvanced stage in the long conflict having been reached, Mr. Adams\r\ncould not hope for life to see another goal passed. His work was\r\nnearly done; he had grown aged, and had worn himself out faithfully\r\ntoiling in the struggle which must hereafter be fought through its\r\ncoming phases and to its final success by others, younger men than he,\r\nthough none of them certainly having over him any other militant\r\nadvantage save only the accident of youth.\r\n\r\nHis mental powers were not less than at any time in the past when, (p. 307)\r\non November 19, 1846, he was struck by paralysis in the street\r\nin Boston. He recovered from the attack, however, sufficiently to\r\nresume his duties in Washington some three months later. His\r\nreappearance in the House was marked by a pleasing incident: all the\r\nmembers rose together; business was for the moment suspended; his old\r\naccustomed seat was at once surrendered to him by the gentleman to\r\nwhom it had fallen in the allotment, and he was formally conducted to\r\nit by two members. After this, though punctual in attendance, he only\r\nonce took part in debate. On February 21, 1848, he appeared in his\r\nseat as usual. At half past one in the afternoon the Speaker was\r\nrising to put a question, when he was suddenly interrupted by cries of\r\n\"Stop! Stop!--Mr. Adams!\" Some gentlemen near Mr. Adams had thought\r\nthat he was striving to rise to address the Speaker, when in an\r\ninstant he fell over insensible. The members thronged around him in\r\ngreat confusion. The House hastily adjourned. He was placed on a sofa\r\nand removed first to the hall of the rotunda and then to the Speaker's\r\nroom. Medical men were in attendance but could be of no service in the\r\npresence of death. The stern old fighter lay dying almost on the very\r\nfield of so many battles and in the very tracks in which he had    (p. 308)\r\nso often stood erect and unconquerable, taking and dealing so many\r\nmighty blows. Late in the afternoon some inarticulate mutterings were\r\nconstrued into the words, \"Thank the officers of the House.\" Soon\r\nagain he said intelligibly, \"This is the last of earth! I am content!\"\r\nIt was his extreme utterance. He lay thereafter unconscious till the\r\nevening of the 23d, when he passed quietly away.\r\n\r\nHe lies buried \"under the portal of the church at Quincy\" beside his\r\nwife, who survived him four years, his father and his mother. The\r\nmemorial tablet inside the church bears upon it the words \"Alteri\r\nSæculo,\"--surely never more justly or appropriately applied to any man\r\nthan to John Quincy Adams, hardly abused and cruelly misappreciated in\r\nhis own day but whom subsequent generations already begin to honor as\r\none of the greatest of American statesmen, not only preëminent in\r\nability and acquirements, but even more to be honored for profound,\r\nimmutable honesty of purpose and broad, noble humanity of aims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX                                                              (p. 311)\r\n\r\n\r\nABOLITIONISTS, their part in anti-slavery movement, 244, 245;\r\n  urge Adams to extreme actions, 254.\r\n\r\nAdams, Abigail, shows battle of Bunker Hill to her son, 2;\r\n  life near Boston during siege, 2, 3;\r\n  letter of J.
